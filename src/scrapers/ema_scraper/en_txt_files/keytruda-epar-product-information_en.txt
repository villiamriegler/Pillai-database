PD-L1 testing
If specified in the indication, patient selection for treatment with KEYTRUDA based on the tumour
expression of PD-L1 should be confirmed by a validated test (see sections 4.1, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1).
MSI/MMR testing 
If specified in the indication, patient selection for treatment with KEYTRUDA based on
MSI-H/dMMR tumour status should be confirmed by a validated test (see sections 4.1 and 5.1).
Posology
The recommended dose of KEYTRUDA in adults is either 200 mg every 3 weeks or 400 mg every
6 weeks administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes.
The recommended dose of KEYTRUDA as monotherapy in paediatric patients aged 3 years and older
with cHL or patients aged 12 years and older with melanoma is 2 mg/kg bodyweight (bw) (up to a
maximum of 200 mg), every 3 weeks administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes.
For use in combination, see the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for the concomitant
therapies.
Patients should be treated with KEYTRUDA until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (and
up to maximum duration of therapy if specified for an indication). Atypical responses (i.e. an initial
transient increase in tumour size or small new lesions within the first few months followed by tumour
shrinkage) have been observed. It is recommended to continue treatment for clinically stable patients
with initial evidence of disease progression until disease progression is confirmed.
For the adjuvant treatment of melanoma, NSCLC, or RCC, KEYTRUDA should be administered until
disease recurrence, unacceptable toxicity, or for a duration of up to one year.
For the neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment of TNBC, patients should be treated with neoadjuvant
KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy for 8 doses of 200 mg every 3 weeks or 4 doses of
400 mg every 6 weeks or until disease progression that precludes definitive surgery or unacceptable
toxicity, followed by adjuvant treatment with KEYTRUDA as monotherapy for 9 doses of 200 mg
every 3 weeks or 5 doses of 400 mg every 6 weeks or until disease recurrence or unacceptable
toxicity. Patients who experience disease progression that precludes definitive surgery or unacceptable
toxicity related to KEYTRUDA as neoadjuvant treatment in combination with chemotherapy should
not receive KEYTRUDA monotherapy as adjuvant treatment.
Dose delay or discontinuation (see also section 4.4)
No dose reductions of KEYTRUDA are recommended. KEYTRUDA should be withheld or
discontinued to manage adverse reactions as described in Table 1.

The safety of re-initiating pembrolizumab therapy in patients previously experiencing
immune-mediated myocarditis is not known.
KEYTRUDA, as monotherapy or as combination therapy, should be permanently discontinued for
Grade 4 or recurrent Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reactions, unless otherwise specified in
Table 1.
For Grade 4 haematological toxicity, only in patients with cHL, KEYTRUDA should be withheld until
adverse reactions recover to Grades 0-1.
KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib in RCC
For RCC patients treated with KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib, see the SmPC regarding
dosing of axitinib. When used in combination with pembrolizumab, dose escalation of axitinib above
the initial 5 mg dose may be considered at intervals of six weeks or longer (see section 5.1).
For liver enzyme elevations, in patients with RCC being treated with KEYTRUDA in combination with
axitinib:
• 
If ALT or AST ≥ 3 times ULN but < 10 times ULN without concurrent total bilirubin ≥ 2 times
ULN, both KEYTRUDA and axitinib should be withheld until these adverse reactions recover to
Grades 0-1. Corticosteroid therapy may be considered. Rechallenge with a single medicine or
sequential rechallenge with both medicines after recovery may be considered. If rechallenging
with axitinib, dose reduction as per the axitinib SmPC may be considered.
If ALT or AST ≥ 10 times ULN or > 3 times ULN with concurrent total bilirubin ≥ 2 times
ULN, both KEYTRUDA and axitinib should be permanently discontinued and corticosteroid
therapy may be considered. 
• 
KEYTRUDA in combination with lenvatinib
When used in combination with lenvatinib, one or both medicines should be interrupted as
appropriate. Lenvatinib should be withheld, dose reduced, or discontinued in accordance with the
instructions in the lenvatinib SmPC for combination with pembrolizumab. No dose reductions are
recommended for KEYTRUDA. 
Patients treated with KEYTRUDA must be given the patient card and be informed about the risks of
KEYTRUDA (see also package leaflet).
Special populations
Elderly
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients ≥ 65 years (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).
Renal impairment
No dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. KEYTRUDA has
not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).
Hepatic impairment
No dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. KEYTRUDA
has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of KEYTRUDA in children below 18 years of age have not been established
except in paediatric patients with melanoma or cHL. Currently available data are described in
sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2.
Method of administration
KEYTRUDA is for intravenous use. It must be administered by infusion over 30 minutes.
KEYTRUDA must not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus injection.
7

4.3  Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Assessment of PD-L1 status
When assessing the PD-L1 status of the tumour, it is important that a well-validated and robust
methodology is chosen to minimise false negative or false positive determinations.
Immune-mediated adverse reactions
Immune-mediated adverse reactions, including severe and fatal cases, have occurred in patients
receiving pembrolizumab. Most immune-mediated adverse reactions occurring during treatment with
pembrolizumab were reversible and managed with interruptions of pembrolizumab, administration of
corticosteroids and/or supportive care. Immune-mediated adverse reactions have also occurred after
the last dose of pembrolizumab. Immune-mediated adverse reactions affecting more than one body
system can occur simultaneously.
For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, adequate evaluation to confirm aetiology or
exclude other causes should be ensured. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, pembrolizumab
should be withheld and corticosteroids administered. Upon improvement to Grade ≤ 1, corticosteroid
taper should be initiated and continued over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical
studies in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reactions could not be controlled with
corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered.
Pembrolizumab may be restarted within 12 weeks after last dose of KEYTRUDA if the adverse
reaction recovers to Grade ≤ 1 and corticosteroid dose has been reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone or
equivalent per day.
Pembrolizumab must be permanently discontinued for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction
that recurs and for any Grade 4 immune-mediated adverse reaction toxicity, except for
endocrinopathies that are controlled with replacement hormones (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).
Immune-mediated pneumonitis
Pneumonitis has been reported in patients receiving pembrolizumab (see section 4.8). Patients should
be monitored for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Suspected pneumonitis should be confirmed
with radiographic imaging and other causes excluded. Corticosteroids should be administered for
Grade ≥ 2 events (initial dose of 1-2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent followed by a taper);
pembrolizumab should be withheld for Grade 2 pneumonitis, and permanently discontinued for
Grade 3, Grade 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis (see section 4.2).
Immune-mediated colitis
Colitis has been reported in patients receiving pembrolizumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be
monitored for signs and symptoms of colitis, and other causes excluded. Corticosteroids should be
administered for Grade ≥ 2 events (initial dose of 1-2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent followed by
a taper); pembrolizumab should be withheld for Grade 2 or Grade 3 colitis, and permanently
discontinued for Grade 4 or recurrent Grade 3 colitis (see section 4.2). The potential risk of
gastrointestinal perforation should be taken into consideration.
8
Immune-mediated hepatitis
Hepatitis has been reported in patients receiving pembrolizumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be
monitored for changes in liver function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment and as
indicated based on clinical evaluation) and symptoms of hepatitis, and other causes excluded.
Corticosteroids should be administered (initial dose of 0.5-1 mg/kg/day (for Grade 2 events) and
1-2 mg/kg/day (for Grade ≥ 3 events) prednisone or equivalent followed by a taper) and, based on
severity of liver enzyme elevations, pembrolizumab should be withheld or discontinued (see
section 4.2).
Immune-mediated nephritis
Nephritis has been reported in patients receiving pembrolizumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be
monitored for changes in renal function, and other causes of renal dysfunction excluded.
Corticosteroids should be administered for Grade ≥ 2 events (initial dose of 1-2 mg/kg/day prednisone
or equivalent followed by a taper) and, based on severity of creatinine elevations, pembrolizumab
should be withheld for Grade 2, and permanently discontinued for Grade 3 or Grade 4 nephritis (see
section 4.2).
Immune-mediated endocrinopathies
Severe endocrinopathies, including adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis, type 1 diabetes mellitus,
diabetic ketoacidosis, hypothyroidism, and hyperthyroidism have been observed with pembrolizumab
treatment.
Long-term hormone replacement therapy may be necessary in cases of immune-mediated
endocrinopathies.
Adrenal insufficiency (primary and secondary) has been reported in patients receiving pembrolizumab.
Hypophysitis has also been reported in patients receiving pembrolizumab (see section 4.8). Patients
should be monitored for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and hypophysitis (including
hypopituitarism) and other causes excluded. Corticosteroids to treat adrenal insufficiency and other
hormone replacement should be administered as clinically indicated. Pembrolizumab should be
withheld for Grade 2 adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis until the event is controlled with hormone
replacement. Pembrolizumab should be withheld or discontinued for Grades 3 or 4 adrenal
insufficiency or symptomatic hypophysitis. Continuation of pembrolizumab may be considered, after
corticosteroid taper, if needed (see section 4.2). Pituitary function and hormone levels should be
monitored to ensure appropriate hormone replacement.
Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, has been reported in patients receiving
pembrolizumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for hyperglycaemia or other signs and
symptoms of diabetes. Insulin should be administered for type 1 diabetes, and pembrolizumab should
be withheld in cases of type 1 diabetes associated with Grade ≥ 3 hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis until
metabolic control is achieved (see section 4.2).
Thyroid disorders, including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism and thyroiditis, have been reported in
patients receiving pembrolizumab and can occur at any time during treatment. Hypothyroidism is
more frequently reported in patients with HNSCC with prior radiation therapy. Patients should be
monitored for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment and
as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders.
Hypothyroidism may be managed with replacement therapy without treatment interruption and
without corticosteroids. Hyperthyroidism may be managed symptomatically. Pembrolizumab should
be withheld for Grade ≥ 3 until recovery to Grade ≤ 1 hyperthyroidism. Thyroid function and hormone
levels should be monitored to ensure appropriate hormone replacement.
For patients with Grade 3 or Grade 4 endocrinopathies that improved to Grade 2 or lower and are
controlled with hormone replacement, if indicated, continuation of pembrolizumab may be considered
after corticosteroid taper, if needed. Otherwise treatment should be discontinued (see sections 4.2 and
4.8). 
9
Immune-mediated skin adverse reactions 
Immune-mediated severe skin reactions have been reported in patients receiving pembrolizumab (see
section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for suspected severe skin reactions and other causes should
be excluded. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, pembrolizumab should be withheld for
Grade 3 skin reactions until recovery to Grade ≤ 1 or permanently discontinued for Grade 4 skin
reactions, and corticosteroids should be administered (see section 4.2).
Cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported
in patients receiving pembrolizumab (see section 4.8). For suspected SJS or TEN, pembrolizumab
should be withheld and the patient should be referred to a specialised unit for assessment and
treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, pembrolizumab should be permanently discontinued (see
section 4.2). 
Caution should be used when considering the use of pembrolizumab in a patient who has previously
experienced a severe or life-threatening skin adverse reaction on prior treatment with other
immune-stimulatory anti-cancer agents.
Other immune-mediated adverse reactions
The following additional clinically significant, immune-mediated adverse reactions have been reported
in clinical studies or in post-marketing experience: uveitis, arthritis, myositis, myocarditis,
pancreatitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenic syndrome, haemolytic anaemia, sarcoidosis,
encephalitis, myelitis, vasculitis, cholangitis sclerosing, gastritis, cystitis noninfective and
hypoparathyroidism (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).
Based on the severity and type of the adverse reaction, pembrolizumab should be withheld for Grade 2
or Grade 3 events and corticosteroids administered.
Pembrolizumab may be restarted within 12 weeks after last dose of KEYTRUDA if the adverse
reaction recovers to Grade ≤ 1 and corticosteroid dose has been reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone or
equivalent per day. 
Pembrolizumab must be permanently discontinued for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction
that recurs and for any Grade 4 immune-mediated adverse reaction.
For Grades 3 or 4 myocarditis, encephalitis or Guillain-Barré syndrome, pembrolizumab should be
permanently discontinued (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).
Transplant-related adverse reactions
Solid organ transplant rejection
Solid organ transplant rejection has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients treated with
PD-1 inhibitors. Treatment with pembrolizumab may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ
transplant recipients. The benefit of treatment with pembrolizumab versus the risk of possible organ
rejection should be considered in these patients.
Complications of allogeneic Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT)
Allogeneic HSCT after treatment with pembrolizumab
Cases of graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) and hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) have been
observed in patients with cHL undergoing allogeneic HSCT after previous exposure to
pembrolizumab. Until further data become available, careful consideration to the potential benefits of
HSCT and the possible increased risk of transplant-related complications should be made case by case
(see section 4.8).
10
Allogeneic HSCT prior to treatment with pembrolizumab
In patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD, including fatal GVHD, has been reported
after treatment with pembrolizumab. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure
may be at an increased risk for GVHD after treatment with pembrolizumab. Consider the benefit of
treatment with pembrolizumab versus the risk of possible GVHD in patients with a history of
allogeneic HSCT.
Infusion-related reactions
Severe infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, have been reported in
patients receiving pembrolizumab (see section 4.8). For Grades 3 or 4 infusion reactions, infusion
should be stopped and pembrolizumab permanently discontinued (see section 4.2). Patients with
Grades 1 or 2 infusion reaction may continue to receive pembrolizumab with close monitoring;
premedication with antipyretic and antihistamine may be considered.
Use of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy
Pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy should be used with caution in patients ≥ 75 years
after careful consideration of the potential benefit/risk on an individual basis (see section 5.1).
Disease-specific precautions
Use of pembrolizumab in urothelial carcinoma patients who have received prior platinum-containing
chemotherapy
Physicians should consider the delayed onset of pembrolizumab effect before initiating treatment in
patients with poorer prognostic features and/or aggressive disease. In urothelial carcinoma, a higher
number of deaths within 2 months was observed in pembrolizumab compared to chemotherapy (see
section 5.1). Factors associated with early deaths were fast progressive disease on prior platinum
therapy and liver metastases.
Use of pembrolizumab in urothelial carcinoma for patients who are considered ineligible for
cisplatin-containing chemotherapy and whose tumours express PD-L1 with CPS ≥  10
The baseline and prognostic disease characteristics of the study population of KEYNOTE-052
included a proportion of patients eligible for a carboplatin-based combination, for whom the benefit
has been assessed in a comparative study (KEYNOTE-361). In KEYNOTE-361, a higher number of
deaths within 6 months of treatment initiation followed by a long-term survival benefit was observed
with pembrolizumab monotherapy compared to chemotherapy (see section 5.1). No specific factor(s)
associated with early deaths could be identified. Physicians should consider the delayed onset of
pembrolizumab effect before initiating treatment in patients with urothelial carcinoma who are
considered eligible for carboplatin-based combination chemotherapy. KEYNOTE-052 also included
patients eligible for mono-chemotherapy, for whom no randomised data are available. In addition, no
safety and efficacy data are available in frailer patients (e.g. ECOG performance status 3) considered
not eligible for chemotherapy. In the absence of these data, pembrolizumab should be used with
caution in this population after careful consideration of the potential risk-benefit on an individual
basis.
Use of pembrolizumab for first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC
In general, the frequency of adverse reactions for pembrolizumab combination therapy is observed to
be higher than for pembrolizumab monotherapy or chemotherapy alone, reflecting the contributions of
each of these components (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). A direct comparison of pembrolizumab when
used in combination with chemotherapy to pembrolizumab monotherapy is not available.
Physicians should consider the benefit/risk balance of the available treatment options (pembrolizumab
monotherapy or pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy) before initiating treatment in
previously untreated patients with NSCLC whose tumours express PD-L1. 
In KEYNOTE-042, a higher number of deaths within 4 months of treatment initiation followed by a
long-term survival benefit was observed with pembrolizumab monotherapy compared to
chemotherapy (see section 5.1).
11
Use of pembrolizumab for first-line treatment of patients with HNSCC
In general, the frequency of adverse reactions for pembrolizumab combination therapy is observed to
be higher than for pembrolizumab monotherapy or chemotherapy alone, reflecting the contributions of
each of these components (see section 4.8). 
Physicians should consider the benefit/risk balance of the available treatment options (pembrolizumab
monotherapy or pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy) before initiating treatment in
patients with HNSCC whose tumours express PD-L1 (see section 5.1).
Use of pembrolizumab for treatment of patients with advanced or recurrent MSI-H or dMMR
endometrial carcinoma
A direct comparison of pembrolizumab when used in combination with lenvatinib to pembrolizumab
monotherapy is not available. Physicians should consider the benefit/risk balance of the available
treatment options (pembrolizumab monotherapy or pembrolizumab in combination with lenvatinib)
before initiating treatment in patients with advanced or recurrent MSI-H or dMMR endometrial
carcinoma.
Use of pembrolizumab for adjuvant treatment of patients with melanoma
A trend toward increased frequency of severe and serious adverse reactions in patients ≥ 75 years was
observed. Safety data of pembrolizumab in the adjuvant melanoma setting in patients ≥ 75 years are
limited.
Use of pembrolizumab in combination with axitinib for first-line treatment of patients with RCC
When pembrolizumab is given with axitinib, higher than expected frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT
and AST elevations have been reported in patients with advanced RCC (see section 4.8). Liver
enzymes should be monitored before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. More
frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the medicines are used in monotherapy
may be considered. Medical management guidelines for both medicines should be followed (see
section 4.2 and refer to the SmPC for axitinib). 
Use of pembrolizumab for first-line treatment of patients with MSI-H/dMMR CRC
In KEYNOTE-177, the hazard rates for overall survival events were greater for pembrolizumab
compared with chemotherapy for the first 4 months of treatment, followed by a long-term survival
benefit for pembrolizumab (see section 5.1).
Use of pembrolizumab for first-line treatment of patients with BTC
Cholangitis and biliary tract infections are not uncommon in patients with BTC. Cholangitis events
were reported in KEYNOTE-966 in both treatment groups (11.2% [n=59] of participants in the
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy arm and 10.3% [n=55] of participants in the placebo plus
chemotherapy arm). Patients with biliary stents and drains (n=74) were at increased risk of cholangitis
and biliary tract infections in KEYNOTE-966 (39.4% [n=13] of participants in the pembrolizumab
plus chemotherapy arm vs. 29.3% [n=12] of participants in the placebo plus chemotherapy arm).
Patients with BTC (especially those with biliary stents) should be closely monitored for development
of cholangitis or biliary tract infections before initiation of treatment and, regularly, thereafter.
Patients excluded from clinical studies
Patients with the following conditions were excluded from clinical studies: active CNS metastases;
ECOG PS ≥ 2 (except for urothelial carcinoma and RCC); HIV infection, hepatitis B or hepatitis C
infection (except for BTC); active systemic autoimmune disease; interstitial lung disease; prior
pneumonitis requiring systemic corticosteroid therapy; a history of severe hypersensitivity to another
monoclonal antibody; receiving immunosuppressive therapy and a history of severe immune-mediated
adverse reactions from treatment with ipilimumab, defined as any Grade 4 toxicity or Grade 3 toxicity
requiring corticosteroid treatment (> 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) for greater than 12 weeks.
Patients with active infections were excluded from clinical studies and were required to have their
infection treated prior to receiving pembrolizumab. Patients with active infections occurring during
treatment with pembrolizumab were managed with appropriate medical therapy. Patients with
12
clinically significant renal (creatinine > 1.5 x ULN) or hepatic (bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN, ALT, AST
> 2.5 x ULN in the absence of liver metastases) abnormalities at baseline were excluded from clinical
studies, therefore information is limited in patients with severe renal and moderate to severe hepatic
impairment.
There are limited data on the safety and efficacy of KEYTRUDA in patients with ocular melanoma
(see section 5.1).
After careful consideration of the potential increased risk, pembrolizumab may be used with
appropriate medical management in these patients. 
Patient card
All prescribers of KEYTRUDA must be familiar with the Physician Information and Management
Guidelines. The prescriber must discuss the risks of KEYTRUDA therapy with the patient. The patient
will be provided with the patient card with each prescription.
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No formal pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies have been conducted with pembrolizumab. Since
pembrolizumab is cleared from the circulation through catabolism, no metabolic drug-drug
interactions are expected. 
The use of systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants before starting pembrolizumab should be
avoided because of their potential interference with the pharmacodynamic activity and efficacy of
pembrolizumab. However, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants can be used after
starting pembrolizumab to treat immune-mediated adverse reactions (see section 4.4). Corticosteroids
can also be used as premedication, when pembrolizumab is used in combination with chemotherapy,
as antiemetic prophylaxis and/or to alleviate chemotherapy-related adverse reactions.
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Women of childbearing potential
Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment with
pembrolizumab and for at least 4 months after the last dose of pembrolizumab.
Pregnancy
There are no data on the use of pembrolizumab in pregnant women. Animal reproduction studies have
not been conducted with pembrolizumab; however, in murine models of pregnancy blockade of PD-L1
signalling has been shown to disrupt tolerance to the foetus and to result in an increased foetal loss
(see section 5.3). These results indicate a potential risk, based on its mechanism of action, that
administration of pembrolizumab during pregnancy could cause foetal harm, including increased rates
of abortion or stillbirth. Human immunoglobulins G4 (IgG4) are known to cross the placental barrier;
therefore, being an IgG4, pembrolizumab has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the
developing foetus. Pembrolizumab should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition
of the woman requires treatment with pembrolizumab.
Breast-feeding
It is unknown whether pembrolizumab is secreted in human milk. Since it is known that antibodies can
be secreted in human milk, a risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision should be
made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue pembrolizumab, taking into account the
benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of pembrolizumab therapy for the woman.
Fertility
No clinical data are available on the possible effects of pembrolizumab on fertility. There were no
notable effects in the male and female reproductive organs in monkeys based on 1-month and 6-month
repeat-dose toxicity studies (see section 5.3).
13
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Pembrolizumab has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. In some patients,
dizziness and fatigue have been reported following administration of pembrolizumab (see section 4.8).
4.8  Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
Pembrolizumab is most commonly associated with immune-mediated adverse reactions. Most of
these, including severe reactions, resolved following initiation of appropriate medical therapy or
withdrawal of pembrolizumab (see “Description of selected adverse reactions” below). The
frequencies included below and in Table 2 are based on all reported adverse drug reactions, regardless
of the investigator assessment of causality.
Pembrolizumab in monotherapy (see section 4.2)
The safety of pembrolizumab as monotherapy has been evaluated in 7,631 patients across tumour
types and across four doses (2 mg/kg bw every 3 weeks, 200 mg every 3 weeks, or 10 mg/kg bw every
2 or 3 weeks) in clinical studies. In this patient population, the median observation time was
8.5 months (range: 1 day to 39 months) and the most frequent adverse reactions with pembrolizumab
were fatigue (31%), diarrhoea (22%), and nausea (20%). The majority of adverse reactions reported
for monotherapy were of Grades 1 or 2 severity. The most serious adverse reactions were
immune-mediated adverse reactions and severe infusion-related reactions (see section 4.4). The
incidences of immune-mediated adverse reactions were 37% all Grades and 9% for Grades 3-5 for
pembrolizumab monotherapy in the adjuvant setting and 25% all Grades and 6% for Grades 3-5 in the
metastatic setting. No new immune-mediated adverse reactions were identified in the adjuvant setting.
Pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy (see section 4.2)
When pembrolizumab is administered in combination, refer to the SmPC for the respective
combination therapy components prior to initiation of treatment. 
The safety of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy has been evaluated in 4,787 patients
across tumour types receiving 200 mg, 2 mg/kg bw or 10 mg/kg bw pembrolizumab every 3 weeks, in
clinical studies. In this patient population, the most frequent adverse reactions were anaemia (53%),
nausea (51%), fatigue (35%), diarrhoea (34%), constipation (32%), vomiting (29%), decreased
appetite (28%), neutropenia (28%), neutrophil count decreased (26%) and alopecia (25%). Incidences
of Grades 3-5 adverse reactions in patients with NSCLC were 67% for pembrolizumab combination
therapy and 66% for chemotherapy alone, in patients with HNSCC were 85% for pembrolizumab
combination therapy and 84% for chemotherapy plus cetuximab, in patients with oesophageal
carcinoma were 86% for pembrolizumab combination therapy and 83% for chemotherapy alone, in
patients with TNBC were 80% for pembrolizumab combination therapy and 77% for chemotherapy
alone, in patients with cervical cancer were 82% for pembrolizumab combination and 75% for
chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab, in patients with gastric cancer were 75% for
pembrolizumab combination therapy (chemotherapy with or without trastuzumab) and 79% for
chemotherapy with or without trastuzumab, and in patients with biliary tract carcinoma were 85% for
pembrolizumab combination therapy and 84% for chemotherapy alone.
Pembrolizumab in combination with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) (see section 4.2)
When pembrolizumab is administered in combination with axitinib or lenvatinib, refer to the SmPC
for axitinib or lenvatinib prior to initiation of treatment. For additional lenvatinib safety information
related to advanced RCC see the SmPC for Kisplyx and for advanced EC see the SmPC for Lenvima.
For additional axitinib safety information for elevated liver enzymes see also section 4.4.
The safety of pembrolizumab in combination with axitinib or lenvatinib in advanced RCC, and in
combination with lenvatinib in advanced EC has been evaluated in a total of 1,456 patients with
advanced RCC or advanced EC receiving 200 mg pembrolizumab every 3 weeks with either axitinib
5 mg twice daily or lenvatinib 20 mg once daily in clinical studies, as appropriate. In these patient
populations, the most frequent adverse reactions were diarrhoea (58%), hypertension (54%),
14
hypothyroidism (46%), fatigue (41%), decreased appetite (40%), nausea (40%), arthralgia (30%),
vomiting (28%), weight decreased (28%), dysphonia (28%), abdominal pain (28%), proteinuria (27%),
palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (26%), rash (26%), stomatitis (25%),
constipation (25%), musculoskeletal pain (23%), headache (23%) and cough (21%). Grades 3-5
adverse reactions in patients with RCC were 80% for pembrolizumab in combination with either
axitinib or lenvatinib and 71% for sunitinib alone. In patients with EC, Grades 3-5 adverse reactions
were 89% for pembrolizumab in combination with lenvatinib and 73% for chemotherapy alone. 
Tabulated summary of adverse reactions
Adverse reactions observed in clinical studies of pembrolizumab as monotherapy or in combination
with chemotherapy or other anti-tumour medicines or reported from post-marketing use of
pembrolizumab are listed in Table 2. These reactions are presented by system organ class and by
frequency. Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10);
uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); and not
known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse
reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness. Adverse reactions known to occur with
pembrolizumab or combination therapy components given alone may occur during treatment with
these medicinal products in combination, even if these reactions were not reported in clinical studies
with combination therapy.
For additional safety information when pembrolizumab is administered in combination, refer to the
SmPC for the respective combination therapy components.

Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 74 (1.0%) patients, including Grade 2, 3 or 4 cases in 34 (0.4%),
31 (0.4%) and 4 (0.1%) patients, respectively, receiving pembrolizumab. The median time to onset of
adrenal insufficiency was 5.4 months (range: 1 day to 23.7 months). The median duration was not
reached (range: 3 days to 40.1+ months). Adrenal insufficiency led to discontinuation of
pembrolizumab in 13 (0.2%) patients. Adrenal insufficiency resolved in 28 patients, 11 with sequelae.
Hypophysitis occurred in 52 (0.7%) patients, including Grade 2, 3 or 4 cases in 23 (0.3%), 24 (0.3%)
and 1 (< 0.1%) patients, respectively, receiving pembrolizumab. The median time to onset of
hypophysitis was 5.9 months (range: 1 day to 17.7 months). The median duration was 3.6 months
(range: 3 days to 48.1+ months). Hypophysitis led to discontinuation of pembrolizumab in 14 (0.2%)
patients. Hypophysitis resolved in 23 patients, 8 with sequelae.
Hyperthyroidism occurred in 394 (5.2%) patients, including Grade 2 or 3 cases in 108 (1.4%) and

(n=389) the incidence of hypothyroidism was 17%, all of which were Grade 1 or 2. In patients with
HNSCC treated with pembrolizumab as monotherapy (n=909), the incidence of hypothyroidism was
16.1% (all Grades) with 0.3% Grade 3. In patients with HNSCC treated with pembrolizumab in
combination with platinum and 5-FU chemotherapy (n=276), the incidence of hypothyroidism
was 15.2%, all of which were Grade 1 or 2. In patients treated with pembrolizumab in combination
with axitinib or lenvatinib (n=1,456), the incidence of hypothyroidism was 46.2% (all Grades) with
0.8% Grade 3 or 4. In patients with melanoma, NSCLC and RCC treated with pembrolizumab
monotherapy in the adjuvant setting (n=2,060), the incidence of hypothyroidism was 18.5%, the
majority of which were Grade 1 or 2.
Immune-mediated skin adverse reactions
Immune-mediated severe skin reactions occurred in 130 (1.7%) patients, including Grade 2, 3, 4 or 5
cases in 11 (0.1%), 103 (1.3%), 1 (< 0.1%) and 1 (< 0.1%) patients, respectively, receiving
pembrolizumab. The median time to onset of severe skin reactions was 2.8 months (range: 2 days to
25.5 months). The median duration was 1.9 months (range: 1 day to 47.1+ months). Severe skin
reactions led to discontinuation of pembrolizumab in 18 (0.2%) patients. Severe skin reactions
resolved in 95 patients, 2 with sequelae.
Rare cases of SJS and TEN, some of them with fatal outcome, have been observed (see sections 4.2
and 4.4).
Complications of allogeneic HSCT in cHL 
Of 14 patients in KEYNOTE-013 who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after treatment with
pembrolizumab, 6 patients reported acute GVHD and 1 patient reported chronic GVHD, none of
which were fatal. Two patients experienced hepatic VOD, one of which was fatal. One patient
experienced engraftment syndrome post-transplant.
Of 32 patients in KEYNOTE-087 who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after treatment with
pembrolizumab, 16 patients reported acute GVHD and 7 patients reported chronic GVHD, two of
which were fatal. No patients experienced hepatic VOD. No patients experienced engraftment
syndrome post-transplant.
Of 14 patients in KEYNOTE-204 who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after treatment with
pembrolizumab, 8 patients reported acute GVHD and 3 patients reported chronic GVHD, none of
which were fatal. No patients experienced hepatic VOD. One patient experienced engraftment
syndrome post-transplant.
Elevated liver enzymes when pembrolizumab is combined with axitinib in RCC
In a clinical study of previously untreated patients with RCC receiving pembrolizumab in combination
with axitinib, a higher than expected incidence of Grades 3 and 4 ALT increased (20%) and AST
increased (13%) were observed. The median time to onset of ALT increased was 2.3 months (range:
7 days to 19.8 months). In patients with ALT ≥ 3 times ULN (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to
Grades 0-1 in 94%. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic
corticosteroids. Of the patients who recovered, 92 (84%) were rechallenged with either
pembrolizumab (3%) or axitinib (31%) monotherapy or with both (50%). Of these patients, 55% had
no recurrence of ALT > 3 times ULN, and of those patients with recurrence of ALT > 3 times ULN,
all recovered. There were no Grade 5 hepatic events. 
Laboratory abnormalities 
In patients treated with pembrolizumab monotherapy, the proportion of patients who experienced a
shift from baseline to a Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormality was as follows: 9.4% for lymphocytes
decreased, 7.4% for sodium decreased, 5.8% for haemoglobin decreased, 5.3% for phosphate
21

Immunogenicity
In clinical studies in patients treated with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg bw every three weeks, 200 mg
every three weeks, or 10 mg/kg bw every two or three weeks as monotherapy, 36 (1.8%) of
2,034 evaluable patients tested positive for treatment-emergent antibodies to pembrolizumab, of which
9 (0.4%) patients had neutralising antibodies against pembrolizumab. There was no evidence of an
altered pharmacokinetic or safety profile with anti-pembrolizumab binding or neutralising antibody
development.
Paediatric population
The safety of pembrolizumab as monotherapy has been evaluated in 161 paediatric patients aged
9 months to 17 years with advanced melanoma, lymphoma, or PD-L1 positive advanced, relapsed, or
refractory solid tumours at 2 mg/kg bw every 3 weeks in the Phase I/II study KEYNOTE-051. The
cHL population (n=22) included patients 11 to 17 years of age. The safety profile in paediatric patients
was generally similar to that seen in adults treated with pembrolizumab. The most common adverse
reactions (reported in at least 20% of paediatric patients) were pyrexia (33%), vomiting (30%),
headache (26%), abdominal pain (22%), anaemia (21%), cough (21%) and constipation (20%). The
majority of adverse reactions reported for monotherapy were of Grades 1 or 2 severity.
Seventy-six (47.2%) patients had 1 or more Grades 3 to 5 adverse reactions of which 5 (3.1%) patients
had 1 or more adverse reactions that resulted in death. The frequencies are based on all reported
adverse drug reactions, regardless of the investigator assessment of causality. Long-term safety data of
pembrolizumab in adolescents with Stage IIB, IIC and III melanoma treated in the adjuvant setting are
currently unavailable.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare
22
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system
listed in Appendix V.
4.9  Overdose
There is no information on overdose with pembrolizumab. 
In case of overdose, patients must be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions,
and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, PD-1/PDL-1 (Programmed cell death protein
1/death ligand 1) inhibitors. ATC code: L01FF02
Mechanism of action
KEYTRUDA is a humanised monoclonal antibody which binds to the programmed cell death-1
(PD-1) receptor and blocks its interaction with ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. The PD-1 receptor is a
negative regulator of T-cell activity that has been shown to be involved in the control of T-cell
immune responses. KEYTRUDA potentiates T-cell responses, including anti-tumour responses,
through blockade of PD-1 binding to PD-L1 and PD-L2, which are expressed in antigen presenting
cells and may be expressed by tumours or other cells in the tumour microenvironment. 
The anti-angiogenic effect of lenvatinib (multi-TKI) in combination with the immune-stimulatory
effect of pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) results in a tumour microenvironment with greater T-cell
activation to help overcome primary and acquired resistance to immunotherapy and may improve
tumour responses compared to either treatment alone. In preclinical murine models, PD-1 plus TKI
inhibitors have demonstrated enhanced anti-tumour activity compared to either agent alone.
Clinical efficacy and safety
Pembrolizumab doses of 2 mg/kg bw every 3 weeks, 10 mg/kg bw every 3 weeks, and 10 mg/kg bw
every 2 weeks were evaluated in melanoma or previously treated NSCLC clinical studies. Based on
the modelling and simulation of dose/exposure relationships for efficacy and safety for
pembrolizumab, there are no clinically significant differences in efficacy or safety among the doses of
200 mg every 3 weeks, 2 mg/kg bw every 3 weeks, and 400 mg every 6 weeks (see section 4.2).
Melanoma
KEYNOTE-006: Controlled study in melanoma patients naïve to treatment with ipilimumab
The safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab were investigated in KEYNOTE-006, a multicentre,
open-label, controlled, Phase III study for the treatment of advanced melanoma in patients who were
naïve to ipilimumab. Patients were randomised (1:1:1) to receive pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg bw every
2 (n=279) or 3 weeks (n=277) or ipilimumab 3 mg/kg bw every 3 weeks (n=278). Patients with BRAF
V600E mutant melanoma were not required to have received prior BRAF inhibitor therapy.
Patients were treated with pembrolizumab until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Clinically stable patients with initial evidence of disease progression were permitted to remain on
treatment until disease progression was confirmed. Assessment of tumour status was performed at
12 weeks, then every 6 weeks through Week 48, followed by every 12 weeks thereafter. 
Of the 834 patients, 60% were male, 44% were ≥ 65 years (median age was 62 years [range: 18-89])
and 98% were white. Sixty-five percent of patients had M1c stage, 9% had a history of brain
metastases, 66% had no and 34% had one prior therapy. Thirty-one percent had an ECOG
Performance Status of 1, 69% had ECOG Performance Status of 0 and 32% had elevated LDH. BRAF
23
mutations were reported in 302 (36%) patients. Among patients with BRAF mutant tumours,
139 (46%) were previously treated with a BRAF inhibitor.
The primary efficacy outcome measures were progression-free survival (PFS; as assessed by
Integrated Radiology and Oncology Assessment [IRO] review using Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumours [RECIST], version 1.1) and overall survival (OS). Secondary efficacy outcome
measures were objective response rate (ORR) and response duration. Table 3 summarises key efficacy
measures in patients naïve to treatment with ipilimumab at the final analysis performed after a
minimum of 21 months of follow-up. Kaplan-Meier curves for OS and PFS based on the final analysis
are shown in Figures 1 and 2.

KEYNOTE-002: Controlled study in melanoma patients previously treated with ipilimumab
The safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab were investigated in KEYNOTE-002, a multicentre,
double-blind, controlled study for the treatment of advanced melanoma in patients previously treated
with ipilimumab and if BRAF V600 mutation-positive, with a BRAF or MEK inhibitor. Patients were
randomised (1:1:1) to receive pembrolizumab at a dose of 2 (n=180) or 10 mg/kg bw (n=181) every
3 weeks or chemotherapy (n=179; including dacarbazine, temozolomide, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or
carboplatin+paclitaxel). The study excluded patients with autoimmune disease or those receiving
immunosuppression; further exclusion criteria were a history of severe or life-threatening
immune-mediated adverse reactions from treatment with ipilimumab, defined as any Grade 4 toxicity
or Grade 3 toxicity requiring corticosteroid treatment (> 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent dose) for
greater than 12 weeks; ongoing adverse reactions ≥ Grade 2 from previous treatment with ipilimumab;
previous severe hypersensitivity to other monoclonal antibodies; a history of pneumonitis or interstitial
lung disease; HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection and ECOG Performance Status ≥ 2. 
Patients were treated with pembrolizumab until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Clinically stable patients with initial evidence of disease progression were permitted to remain on
treatment until disease progression was confirmed. Assessment of tumour status was performed at
12 weeks, then every 6 weeks through Week 48, followed by every 12 weeks thereafter. Patients on
chemotherapy who experienced independently-verified progression of disease after the first scheduled
disease assessment were able to crossover and receive 2 mg/kg bw or 10 mg/kg bw of pembrolizumab
every 3 weeks in a double-blind fashion.
Of the 540 patients, 61% were male, 43% were ≥ 65 years (median age was 62 years [range: 15-89])
and 98% were white. Eighty-two percent had M1c stage, 73% had at least two and 32% of patients had
three or more prior systemic therapies for advanced melanoma. Forty-five percent had an ECOG
Performance Status of 1, 40% had elevated LDH and 23% had a BRAF mutated tumour. 
The primary efficacy outcome measures were PFS as assessed by IRO using RECIST version 1.1 and
OS. Secondary efficacy outcome measures were ORR and response duration. Table 4 summarises key
efficacy measures at the final analysis in patients previously treated with ipilimumab, and the
Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS is shown in Figure 3. Both pembrolizumab arms were superior to
chemotherapy for PFS, and there was no difference between pembrolizumab doses. There was no
statistically significant difference between pembrolizumab and chemotherapy in the final OS analysis
that was not adjusted for the potentially confounding effects of crossover. Of the patients randomised
to the chemotherapy arm, 55% crossed over and subsequently received treatment with pembrolizumab.

KEYNOTE-001: Open-label study in melanoma patients naïve and previously treated with ipilimumab
The safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab for patients with advanced melanoma were investigated in
an uncontrolled, open-label study, KEYNOTE-001. Efficacy was evaluated for 276 patients from two
defined cohorts, one which included patients previously treated with ipilimumab (and if BRAF V600
mutation-positive, with a BRAF or MEK inhibitor) and the other which included patients naïve to
treatment with ipilimumab. Patients were randomly assigned to receive pembrolizumab at a dose of
2 mg/kg bw every 3 weeks or 10 mg/kg bw every 3 weeks. Patients were treated with pembrolizumab
until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Clinically stable patients with initial evidence of
disease progression were permitted to remain on treatment until disease progression was confirmed.
Exclusion criteria were similar to those of KEYNOTE-002.
Of the 89 patients receiving 2 mg/kg bw of pembrolizumab who were previously treated with
ipilimumab, 53% were male, 33% were ≥ 65 years of age and the median age was 59 years (range:
18-88). All but two patients were white. Eighty-four percent had M1c stage and 8% of patients had a
history of brain metastases. Seventy percent had at least two and 35% of patients had three or more
prior systemic therapies for advanced melanoma. BRAF mutations were reported in 13% of the study
population. All patients with BRAF mutant tumours were previously treated with a BRAF inhibitor.
Of the 51 patients receiving 2 mg/kg bw of pembrolizumab who were naïve to treatment with
ipilimumab, 63% were male, 35% were ≥ 65 years of age and the median age was 60 years (range:
35-80). All but one patient was white. Sixty-three percent had M1c stage and 2% of patients had a
history of brain metastases. Forty-five percent had no prior therapies for advanced melanoma. BRAF
mutations were reported in 20 (39%) patients. Among patients with BRAF mutant tumours, 10 (50%)
were previously treated with a BRAF inhibitor.
The primary efficacy outcome measure was ORR as assessed by independent review using
RECIST 1.1. Secondary efficacy outcome measures were disease control rate (DCR; including
complete response, partial response and stable disease), response duration, PFS and OS. Tumour

response was assessed at 12 week intervals. Table 5 summarises key efficacy measures in patients
previously treated or naïve to treatment with ipilimumab, receiving pembrolizumab at a dose of
2 mg/kg bw based on a minimum follow-up time of 30 months for all patients.

In 20 subjects with ocular melanoma included in KEYNOTE-001, no objective responses were
reported; stable disease was reported in 6 patients.
KEYNOTE-716: Placebo-controlled study for the adjuvant treatment of patients with resected Stage
IIB or IIC melanoma
The efficacy of pembrolizumab was evaluated in KEYNOTE-716, a multicentre, randomised,
double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with resected Stage IIB or IIC melanoma. A total of
976 patients were randomised (1:1) to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg every three weeks (or the
paediatric [12 to 17 years old] dose of 2 mg/kg intravenously [up to a maximum of 200 mg] every
three weeks) (n=487) or placebo (n=489), for up to one year or until disease recurrence or
unacceptable toxicity. Randomisation was stratified by American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)
8th edition T stage. Patients with active autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required
immunosuppression or mucosal or ocular melanoma were ineligible. Patients who received prior
therapy for melanoma other than surgery were ineligible. Patients underwent imaging every six
months from randomisation through the 4th year, and then once in year 5 from randomisation or until
recurrence, whichever came first.
Among the 976 patients, the baseline characteristics were: median age of 61 years (range: 16-87; 39%
age 65 or older; 2 adolescent patients [one per treatment arm]); 60% male; and ECOG PS of 0 (93%)
and 1 (7%). Sixty-four percent had Stage IIB and 35% had Stage IIC. 
The primary efficacy outcome measure was investigator-assessed recurrence-free survival (RFS) in
the whole population, where RFS was defined as the time between the date of randomisation and the
date of first recurrence (local, regional, or distant metastasis) or death, whichever occurred first. The
secondary outcome measures were distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and OS in the whole
population. OS was not formally assessed at the time of this analysis. The study initially demonstrated
31
 
 
a statistically significant improvement in RFS (HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.46, 0.92; p-Value = 0.00658) for
patients randomised to the pembrolizumab arm compared with placebo at its pre-specified interim
analysis. Results reported from the pre-specified final analysis for RFS at a median follow-up of
20.5 months are summarised in Table 10. Updated RFS results at a median follow-up of 38.5 months
were consistent with the final analysis for RFS for patients randomised to the pembrolizumab arm
compared with placebo (HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.49, 0.79) (see Figure 4). The study demonstrated a
statistically significant improvement in DMFS (HR 0.64; 95% CI 0.47, 0.88; p-Value = 0.00292) for
patients randomised to the pembrolizumab arm compared with placebo at its pre-specified interim
analysis at a median follow-up of 26.9 months. Results reported from the pre-specified final analysis
for DMFS at a median follow-up time of 38.5 months are summarised in Table 10 and Figure 5.

KEYNOTE-054: Placebo-controlled study for the adjuvant treatment of patients with completely
resected Stage III melanoma
The efficacy of pembrolizumab was evaluated in KEYNOTE-054, a multicentre, randomised,
double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with completely resected stage IIIA (> 1 mm lymph
node metastasis), IIIB or IIIC melanoma. A total of 1,019 adult patients were randomised (1:1) to
receive pembrolizumab 200 mg every three weeks (n=514) or placebo (n=505), for up to one year
until disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. Randomisation was stratified by AJCC 7 th edition
stage (IIIA vs. IIIB vs. IIIC 1-3 positive lymph nodes vs. IIIC ≥ 4 positive lymph nodes) and
geographic region (North America, European countries, Australia and other countries as designated).
Patients must have undergone lymph node dissection, and if indicated, radiotherapy within 13 weeks
prior to starting treatment. Patients with active autoimmune disease or a medical condition that
required immunosuppression or mucosal or ocular melanoma were ineligible. Patients who received
prior therapy for melanoma other than surgery or interferon for thick primary melanomas without
evidence of lymph node involvement were ineligible. Patients underwent imaging every 12 weeks
after the first dose of pembrolizumab for the first two years, then every 6 months from year 3 to 5, and
then annually.
Among the 1,019 patients, the baseline characteristics were: median age of 54 years (25% age 65 or
older); 62% male; and ECOG PS of 0 (94%) and 1 (6%). Sixteen percent had stage IIIA; 46% had
stage IIIB; 18% had stage IIIC (1-3 positive lymph nodes) and 20% had stage IIIC (≥ 4 positive lymph
nodes); 50% were BRAF V600 mutation positive and 44% were BRAF wild-type. PD-L1 expression
was tested retrospectively by IHC assay with the 22C3 anti-PD-L1 antibody; 84% of patients had
PD-L1-positive melanoma (PD-L1 expression in ≥ 1% of tumour and tumour-associated immune cells
34
 
 
 
 
relative to all viable tumour cells). The same scoring system was used for metastatic melanoma (MEL
score). 
The primary efficacy outcome measures were investigator-assessed RFS in the whole population and
in the population with PD-L1 positive tumours, where RFS was defined as the time between the date
of randomisation and the date of first recurrence (local, regional, or distant metastasis) or death,
whichever occurred first. The secondary outcome measures were DMFS and OS in the whole
population and in the population with PD-L1 positive tumours. OS was not formally assessed at the
time of these analyses. The study initially demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in RFS
(HR 0.57; 98.4% CI 0.43, 0.74; p-Value < 0.0001) for patients randomised to the pembrolizumab arm
compared with placebo at its pre-specified interim analysis. Updated efficacy results with a median
follow-up time of 45.5 months are summarised in Table 11 and Figures 6 and 7.

RFS and DMFS benefit was consistently demonstrated across subgroups, including tumour PD-L1
expression, BRAF mutation status, and stage of disease (using AJCC 7th edition). These results were
consistent when reclassified in a post-hoc analysis according to the current AJCC 8th edition staging
system.
NSCLC
KEYNOTE-091: Placebo-controlled study for the adjuvant treatment of patients with resected NSCLC
The efficacy of pembrolizumab was investigated in KEYNOTE-091, a multicentre, randomised,
triple-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with NSCLC who are at high risk (stage IB
[T2a ≥ 4 cm], II or IIIA by AJCC 7th edition) of recurrence following complete resection, regardless of
tumour PD-L1 expression status, no prior neoadjuvant radiotherapy and/or neoadjuvant chemotherapy,
and no prior or planned adjuvant radiotherapy for the current malignancy. Testing for genomic tumour
aberrations/oncogenic drivers was not mandatory for enrolment. 
The following selection criteria define patients with high risk of recurrence who are included in the
therapeutic indication and are reflective of the patient population with stage IB [T2a ≥ 4 cm], II or IIIA
according to the 7th edition staging system: Tumour size ≥ 4 cm; or tumours of any size that are either
accompanied by N1 or N2 status; or tumours that are invasive of thoracic structures (directly invade
the parietal pleura, chest wall, diaphragm, phrenic nerve, mediastinal pleura, parietal pericardium,
mediastinum, heart, great vessels, trachea, recurrent laryngeal nerve, oesophagus, vertebral body,
carina); or tumours that involve the main bronchus < 2 cm distal to the carina but without involvement
of the carina; or tumours that are associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis of the entire
lung; or tumours with separate nodule(s) in the same lobe or different ipsilateral lobe as the primary.
The study did not include patients who had N2 status with tumours also invading the mediastinum,
heart, great vessels, trachea, recurrent laryngeal nerve, oesophagus, vertebral body, carina, or with
separate tumour nodule(s) in a different ipsilateral lobe.
Patients may or may not have received adjuvant chemotherapy as recommended by their physician.
Patients with autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment; a
medical condition that required immunosuppression; or who had received more than 4 cycles of
adjuvant chemotherapy were ineligible. Randomisation was stratified by stage (IB vs. II vs. IIIA),
adjuvant chemotherapy (no adjuvant chemotherapy vs. adjuvant chemotherapy), PD-L1 status
(TPS < 1% [negative] vs. TPS 1-49% vs. TPS ≥ 50%), and geographic region (Western Europe vs.
Eastern Europe vs. Asia vs. Rest of World). Patients were randomised (1:1) to receive pembrolizumab
200 mg (n=590) or placebo (n=587) intravenously every 3 weeks.
Treatment continued until RECIST 1.1-defined disease recurrence as determined by the investigator,
unacceptable toxicity, or approximately 1 year (18 doses). Patients underwent imaging every 12 weeks
after the first dose of pembrolizumab for the first year, then every 6 months for years 2 to 3, and then
annually up to the end of year 5. After year 5, imaging is performed as per local standard of care.
Of 1,177 patients randomised, 1,010 (86%) received adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy following
complete resection. Among these 1,010 patients in KEYNOTE-091, baseline characteristics were:
median age of 64 years (range: 35 to 84), 49% age 65 or older; 68% male; and 77% White,
18% Asian, 86% current or former smokers. Sixty-one percent and 39% had ECOG performance of 0
or 1, respectively. Twelve percent had stage IB (T2a ≥ 4 cm), 57% had stage II, and 31% had stage
IIIA disease. Thirty-nine percent had tumour PD-L1 expression TPS < 1% [negative], 33% had TPS
1-49%, 28% had TPS ≥ 50%. Seven percent had known EGFR mutations, thirty-eight percent without
EGFR mutations and in fifty-six percent EGFR mutation status was unknown. Fifty-two percent were
from Western Europe, 20% from Eastern Europe, 17% from Asia, and 11% from Rest of World.
The primary efficacy outcome measures were investigator-assessed disease-free survival (DFS) in the
overall population and in the population with tumour PD-L1 expression TPS ≥ 50% where DFS was
defined as the time between the date of randomisation and the date of first recurrence (local/regional
recurrence, distant metastasis), a second malignancy, or death, whichever occurred first. Secondary
efficacy outcome measures were investigator-assessed DFS in the population with tumour PD-L1
37
expression TPS ≥ 1%, and OS in the overall population and in the populations with tumour PD-L1
expression TPS ≥ 50% and TPS ≥ 1%.
The study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in DFS in the overall population
(HR = 0.76 [95% CI: 0.63, 0.91; p = 0.0014]) at a pre-specified interim analysis with a median
follow-up time of 32.4 months (range: 0.6 to 68 months) for patients randomised to the
pembrolizumab arm compared to patients randomised to the placebo arm. Table 12 and Figure 8
summarise efficacy results in patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy at the final analysis for
DFS performed at a median follow-up time of 46.7 months (range: 0.6 to 84.2). At the time of this
analysis, OS results were not mature with only 58% of pre-specified OS events in the overall
population. An exploratory analysis of OS suggested a trend in favour of pembrolizumab compared to
placebo with a HR of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.62, 1.01) in patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy.

KEYNOTE-024: Controlled study of NSCLC patients naïve to treatment
The safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab were investigated in KEYNOTE-024, a multicentre,
open-label, controlled study for the treatment of previously untreated metastatic NSCLC. Patients had
PD-L1 expression with a  50% TPS based on the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDxTM Kit. Patients were
randomised (1:1) to receive pembrolizumab at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks (n=154) or
investigator’s choice platinum-containing chemotherapy (n=151; including pemetrexed+carboplatin,
pemetrexed+cisplatin, gemcitabine+cisplatin, gemcitabine+carboplatin, or paclitaxel+carboplatin.
Patients with non-squamous NSCLC could receive pemetrexed maintenance.). Patients were treated
with pembrolizumab until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Treatment could continue
beyond disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and was considered to be deriving
clinical benefit by the investigator. Patients without disease progression could be treated for up to
24 months. The study excluded patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumour aberrations; autoimmune
disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment; a medical condition that required
immunosuppression; or who had received more than 30 Gy of thoracic radiation within the prior
26 weeks. Assessment of tumour status was performed every 9 weeks. Patients on chemotherapy who
experienced independently-verified progression of disease were able to crossover and receive
pembrolizumab.
Among the 305 patients in KEYNOTE-024, baseline characteristics were: median age 65 years (54%
age 65 or older); 61% male; 82% White, 15% Asian; and ECOG performance status 0 and 1 in 35%
39
 
 
 
 
 
and 65%, respectively. Disease characteristics were squamous (18%) and non-squamous (82%); M1
(99%); and brain metastases (9%).
The primary efficacy outcome measure was PFS as assessed by blinded independent central review
(BICR) using RECIST 1.1. Secondary efficacy outcome measures were OS and ORR (as assessed by
BICR using RECIST 1.1). Table 13 summarises key efficacy measures for the entire intent to treat
(ITT) population. PFS and ORR results are reported from an interim analysis at a median follow-up of
11 months. OS results are reported from the final analysis at a median follow-up of 25 months.

In a subgroup analysis, a reduced survival benefit of pembrolizumab compared to chemotherapy was
observed in the small number of patients who were never-smokers; however, due to the small number
of patients, no definitive conclusions can be drawn from these data.
KEYNOTE-042: Controlled study of NSCLC patients naïve to treatment
The safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab were also investigated in KEYNOTE-042, a multicentre,
controlled study for the treatment of previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. The
41
 
 
 
 
study design was similar to that of KEYNOTE-024, except that patients had PD-L1 expression with a
 1% TPS based on the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDxTM Kit. Patients were randomised (1:1) to receive
pembrolizumab at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks (n=637) or investigator’s choice platinum-
containing chemotherapy (n=637; including pemetrexed+carboplatin or paclitaxel+carboplatin.
Patients with non-squamous NSCLC could receive pemetrexed maintenance.). Assessment of tumour
status was performed every 9 weeks for the first 45 weeks, and every 12 weeks thereafter.
Among the 1,274 patients in KEYNOTE-042, 599 (47%) had tumours that expressed PD-L1 with TPS
≥ 50% based on the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDxTM Kit. The baseline characteristics of these
599 patients included: median age 63 years (45% age 65 or older); 69% male; 63% White and
32% Asian; 17% Hispanic or Latino; and ECOG performance status 0 and 1 in 31% and 69%,
respectively. Disease characteristics were squamous (37%) and non-squamous (63%); stage IIIA
(0.8%); stage IIIB (9%); stage IV (90%); and treated brain metastases (6%).
The primary efficacy outcome measure was OS. Secondary efficacy outcome measures were PFS and
ORR (as assessed by BICR using RECIST 1.1). The study demonstrated a statistically significant
improvement in OS for patients whose tumours expressed PD-L1 TPS ≥ 1% randomised to
pembrolizumab monotherapy compared to chemotherapy (HR 0.82; 95% CI 0.71, 0.93 at the final
analysis) and in patients whose tumours expressed PD-L1 TPS ≥ 50% randomised to pembrolizumab
monotherapy compared to chemotherapy. Table 14 summarises key efficacy measures for the TPS
 50% population at the final analysis performed at a median follow-up of 15.4 months. The Kaplan-
Meier curve for OS for the TPS ≥ 50% population based on the final analysis is shown in Figure 11.

The results of a post-hoc exploratory subgroup analysis indicated a trend towards reduced survival
benefit of pembrolizumab compared to chemotherapy, during both the first 4 months and throughout
the entire duration of treatment, in patients who were never-smokers. However, due to the exploratory
nature of this subgroup analysis, no definitive conclusions can be drawn.
KEYNOTE-189: Controlled study of combination therapy in non-squamous NSCLC patients naïve to
treatment
The efficacy of pembrolizumab in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy was
investigated in a multicentre, randomised, active-controlled, double-blind study, KEYNOTE-189. Key
eligibility criteria were metastatic non-squamous NSCLC, no prior systemic treatment for metastatic
NSCLC, and no EGFR or ALK genomic tumour aberrations. Patients with autoimmune disease that
required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment; a medical condition that required
immunosuppression; or who had received more than 30 Gy of thoracic radiation within the prior
26 weeks were ineligible. Patients were randomised (2:1) to receive one of the following regimens:
Pembrolizumab 200 mg with pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 and investigator’s choice of
cisplatin 75 mg/m2 or carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min intravenously every 3 weeks for
4 cycles followed by pembrolizumab 200 mg and pemetrexed 500 mg/m2
intravenously every 3 weeks (n=410)
Placebo with pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 and investigator’s choice of cisplatin 75 mg/m2
or carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed
by placebo and pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks (n=206)
• 
• 
Treatment with pembrolizumab continued until RECIST 1.1-defined progression of disease as
determined by the investigator, unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 24 months. Administration of
pembrolizumab was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression by BICR or beyond
discontinuation of pemetrexed if the patient was clinically stable and deriving clinical benefit as
43
determined by the investigator. For patients who completed 24 months of therapy or had a complete
response, treatment with pembrolizumab could be reinitiated for disease progression and administered
for up to 1 additional year. Assessment of tumour status was performed at Week 6 and Week 12,
followed by every 9 weeks thereafter. Patients receiving placebo plus chemotherapy who experienced
independently-verified progression of disease were offered pembrolizumab as monotherapy.
Among the 616 patients in KEYNOTE-189, baseline characteristics were: median age of 64 years
(49% age 65 or older); 59% male; 94% White and 3% Asian; 43% and 56% ECOG performance status
of 0 or 1 respectively; 31% PD-L1 negative (TPS < 1%); and 18% with treated or untreated brain
metastases at baseline.
The primary efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS (as assessed by BICR using RECIST 1.1).
Secondary efficacy outcome measures were ORR and response duration, as assessed by BICR using
RECIST 1.1. Table 15 summarises key efficacy measures and Figures 12 and 13 show the
Kaplan-Meier curves for OS and PFS based on the final analysis with a median follow-up of
18.8 months.

KEYNOTE-407: Controlled study of combination therapy in squamous NSCLC patients naïve to
treatment
The efficacy of pembrolizumab in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel
was investigated in Study KEYNOTE-407, a randomised, double-blind, multicentre,
placebo-controlled study. The key eligibility criteria for this study were metastatic squamous NSCLC,
regardless of tumour PD-L1 expression status, and no prior systemic treatment for metastatic disease.
Patients with autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment; a
medical condition that required immunosuppression; or who had received more than 30 Gy of thoracic
radiation within the prior 26 weeks were ineligible. Randomisation was stratified by tumour PD-L1
expression (TPS < 1% [negative] vs. TPS ≥ 1%), investigator’s choice of paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel,
and geographic region (East Asia vs. non-East Asia). Patients were randomised (1:1) to one of the
following treatment arms via intravenous infusion:
• 
• 
Pembrolizumab 200 mg and carboplatin AUC 6 mg/mL/min on Day 1 of each 21-day
cycle for 4 cycles, and paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for
4 cycles or nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 21-day cycle for
4 cycles, followed by pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks. Pembrolizumab was
administered prior to chemotherapy on Day 1.
Placebo and carboplatin AUC 6 mg/mL/min on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for
4 cycles and paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 cycles or
nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 21-day cycle for 4 cycles,
followed by placebo every 3 weeks.
Treatment with pembrolizumab or placebo continued until RECIST 1.1-defined progression of disease
as determined by BICR, unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 24 months. Administration of
pembrolizumab was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression if the patient was
clinically stable and deriving clinical benefit as determined by the investigator. 
Patients in the placebo arm were offered pembrolizumab as a single agent at the time of disease
progression.
Assessment of tumour status was performed every 6 weeks through Week 18, every 9 weeks through
Week 45 and every 12 weeks thereafter. 
A total of 559 patients were randomised. The study population characteristics were: median age of
65 years (range: 29 to 88); 55% age 65 or older; 81% male; 77% White; ECOG performance status of
0 (29%) and 1 (71%); and 8% with treated brain metastases at baseline. Thirty-five percent had
tumour PD-L1 expression TPS < 1% [negative]; 19% were East Asian; and 60% received paclitaxel.
The primary efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS (as assessed by BICR using RECIST 1.1).
Secondary efficacy outcome measures were ORR and response duration, as assessed by BICR using
RECIST 1.1. Table 17 summarises key efficacy measures and Figures 14 and 15 show the
Kaplan-Meier curves for OS and PFS based on the final analysis with a median follow-up of

KEYNOTE-010: Controlled study of NSCLC patients previously treated with chemotherapy
The safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab were investigated in KEYNOTE-010, a multicentre,
open-label, controlled study for the treatment of advanced NSCLC in patients previously treated with
platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients had PD-L1 expression with a  1% TPS based on the
PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDxTM Kit. Patients with EGFR activation mutation or ALK translocation also
had disease progression on approved therapy for these mutations prior to receiving pembrolizumab.
Patients were randomised (1:1:1) to receive pembrolizumab at a dose of 2 (n=344) or 10 mg/kg bw
(n=346) every 3 weeks or docetaxel at a dose of 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks (n=343) until disease
progression or unacceptable toxicity. The study excluded patients with autoimmune disease; a medical
condition that required immunosuppression; or who had received more than 30 Gy of thoracic
radiation within the prior 26 weeks. Assessment of tumour status was performed every 9 weeks. 
The baseline characteristics for this population included: median age 63 years (42% age 65 or older);
61% male; 72% White and 21% Asian and 34% and 66% with an ECOG performance status 0 and 1,
respectively. Disease characteristics were squamous (21%) and non-squamous (70%); stage IIIA (2%);
stage IIIB (7%); stage IV (91%); stable brain metastases (15%) and the incidence of mutations was
EGFR (8%) or ALK (1%). Prior therapy included platinum-doublet regimen (100%); patients received
one (69%) or two or more (29%) treatment lines.
The primary efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS as assessed by BICR using RECIST 1.1.
Secondary efficacy outcome measures were ORR and response duration. Table 19 summarises key
efficacy measures for the entire population (TPS  1%) and for the patients with TPS  50%, and
Figure 16 shows the Kaplan-Meier curve for OS (TPS  1%), based on a final analysis with median
follow-up of 42.6 months.

Efficacy results were similar for the 2 mg/kg bw and 10 mg/kg bw pembrolizumab arms. Efficacy
results for OS were consistent regardless of the age of tumour specimen (new vs. archival) based on an
intergroup comparison.
In subgroup analyses, a reduced survival benefit of pembrolizumab compared to docetaxel was
observed for patients who were never-smokers or patients with tumours harbouring EGFR activating
mutations who received at least platinum-based chemotherapy and a tyrosine kinase inhibitor;
however, due to the small numbers of patients, no definitive conclusions can be drawn from these
data.
The efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in patients with tumours that do not express PD-L1 have
not been established.
Classical Hodgkin lymphoma
KEYNOTE-204: Controlled study in patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin
lymphoma (cHL)
The efficacy of pembrolizumab was investigated in KEYNOTE-204, a randomised, open-label,
active-controlled study conducted in 304 patients with relapsed or refractory cHL. Patients with active,
non-infectious pneumonitis, an allogeneic HSCT within the past 5 years (or > 5 years but with
symptoms of GVHD), active autoimmune disease, a medical condition that required
immunosuppression, or an active infection requiring systemic therapy were ineligible for the study.
Randomisation was stratified by prior ASCT (yes vs. no) and disease status after frontline therapy
(primary refractory vs. relapse less than 12 months after completion vs. relapse 12 months or more
after completion). Patients were randomised (1:1) to one of the following treatment arms:
• 
• 
Pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks
Brentuximab vedotin (BV) 1.8 mg/kg bw intravenously every 3 weeks.
53
 
 
Patients received pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or
documented disease progression, or a maximum of 35 cycles. Limited data are currently available on
response duration following pembrolizumab discontinuation at cycle 35. Response was assessed every
12 weeks, with the first planned post-baseline assessment at Week 12.
Among the 304 patients in KEYNOTE-204, there is a subpopulation consisting of 112 patients who
failed a transplant before enrolling and 137 who failed 2 or more prior therapies and were ineligible
for ASCT at the time of enrolment. The baseline characteristics of these 249 patients were: median age
34 years (11% age 65 or older); 56% male; 80% White and 7% Asian and 58% and 41% with an
ECOG performance status 0 and 1, respectively. Approximately 30% were refractory to frontline
chemotherapy and ~ 45% had received prior ASCT. Nodular-sclerosis was the more represented cHL
histological subtype (~ 81%) and bulky disease, B symptoms and bone marrow involvement were
present in approximately 21%, 28% and 4% of patients, respectively. 
The primary efficacy outcome was PFS and the secondary efficacy outcome measure was ORR, both
assessed by BICR according to the 2007 revised International Working Group (IWG) criteria. The
additional primary efficacy outcome measure, OS, was not formally assessed at the time of the
analysis. In the ITT population, the median follow-up time for 151 patients treated with
pembrolizumab was 24.9 months (range: 1.8 to 42.0 months). The initial analysis resulted in a HR for
PFS of 0.65 (95% CI: 0.48, 0.88) with a one-sided p value of 0.0027. The ORR was 66% for
pembrolizumab compared to 54% for standard treatment with a p-Value of 0.0225. Table 20
summarises the efficacy results in the subpopulation. Efficacy results in this subpopulation were
consistent with the ITT population. The Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS for this subpopulation is shown
in Figure 17.

KEYNOTE-087 and KEYNOTE-013: Open-label studies in patients with relapsed or refractory cHL
The efficacy of pembrolizumab was investigated in KEYNOTE-087 and KEYNOTE-013, two
multicentre, open-label studies for the treatment of 241 patients with cHL. These studies enrolled
patients who failed ASCT and BV, who were ineligible for ASCT because they were unable to
achieve a complete or partial remission to salvage chemotherapy and failed BV, or who failed ASCT
and did not receive BV. Five study subjects were ineligible to ASCT due to reasons other than failure
to salvage chemotherapy. Both studies included patients regardless of PD-L1 expression. Patients with
active, non-infectious pneumonitis, an allogeneic transplant within the past 5 years (or > 5 years but
with GVHD), active autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression
were ineligible for either study. Patients received pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks (n=210;
KEYNOTE-087) or 10 mg/kg bw every 2 weeks (n=31; KEYNOTE-013) until unacceptable toxicity
or documented disease progression.
Among KEYNOTE-087 patients, the baseline characteristics were median age 35 years (9% age 65 or
older); 54% male; 88% White; and 49% and 51% had an ECOG performance status 0 and 1,
respectively. The median number of prior lines of therapy administered for the treatment of cHL was 4
(range: 1 to 12). Eighty-one percent were refractory to at least one prior therapy, including 34% who
were refractory to first-line therapy. Sixty-one percent of patients had received ASCT, 38% were
transplant ineligible; 17% had no prior brentuximab vedotin use; and 37% of patients had prior
radiation therapy. Disease subtypes were 81% nodular sclerosis, 11% mixed cellularity, 4%
lymphocyte-rich and 2% lymphocyte-depleted. 
Among KEYNOTE-013 patients, the baseline characteristics were median age 32 years (7% age 65 or
older), 58% male, 94% White; and 45% and 55% had an ECOG performance status 0 and 1,
respectively. The median number of prior lines of therapy administered for the treatment of cHL was 5
(range: 2 to 15). Eighty-four percent were refractory to at least one prior therapy, including 35% who
were refractory to first-line therapy. Seventy-four percent of patients had received ASCT, 26% were
transplant ineligible, and 45% of patients had prior radiation therapy. Disease subtypes were 97%
nodular sclerosis and 3% mixed cellularity.
The primary efficacy outcome measures (ORR and CRR) were assessed by BICR according to the
IWG 2007 criteria. Secondary efficacy outcome measures were duration of response, PFS and OS.
Response was assessed in KEYNOTE-087 and KEYNOTE-013 every 12 and 8 weeks, respectively,
with the first planned post-baseline assessment at Week 12. Main efficacy results are summarised in

Efficacy in elderly patients 
Overall, 46 cHL patients ≥ 65 years were treated with pembrolizumab in studies KEYNOTE-087,
KEYNOTE-013 and KEYNOTE-204. Data from these patients are too limited to draw any conclusion
on efficacy in this population.
Urothelial carcinoma
KEYNOTE-045: Controlled study in urothelial carcinoma patients who have received prior
platinum-containing chemotherapy
The safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab were evaluated in KEYNOTE-045, a multicentre,
open-label, randomised (1:1), controlled study for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic
urothelial carcinoma in patients with disease progression on or after platinum-containing
chemotherapy. Patients must have received first-line platinum-containing regimen for locally
advanced/metastatic disease or as neoadjuvant/adjuvant treatment, with recurrence/progression
≤ 12 months following completion of therapy. Patients were randomised (1:1) to receive either
pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks (n=270) or investigator’s choice of any of the following
chemotherapy regimens all given intravenously every 3 weeks (n=272): paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 (n=84),
docetaxel 75 mg/m2 (n=84), or vinflunine 320 mg/m2 (n=87). Patients were treated with
pembrolizumab until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Treatment could continue beyond
progression if the patient was clinically stable and was considered to be deriving clinical benefit by the
investigator. Patients without disease progression could be treated for up to 24 months. The study
excluded patients with autoimmune disease, a medical condition that required immunosuppression and
patients with more than 2 prior lines of systemic chemotherapy for metastatic urothelial carcinoma.
Patients with an ECOG performance status of 2 had to have a haemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL, could not have
liver metastases, and must have received the last dose of their last prior chemotherapy regimen
57
 
≥ 3 months prior to enrolment. Assessment of tumour status was performed at 9 weeks after the first
dose, then every 6 weeks through the first year, followed by every 12 weeks thereafter. 
Among the 542 randomised patients in KEYNOTE-045, baseline characteristics were: median age
66 years (range: 26 to 88), 58% age 65 or older; 74% male; 72% White and 23% Asian; 56% ECOG
performance status of 1 and 1% ECOG performance status of 2; and 96% M1 disease and 4% M0
disease. Eighty-seven percent of patients had visceral metastases, including 34% with liver metastases.
Eighty-six percent had a primary tumour in the lower tract and 14% had a primary tumour in the upper
tract. Fifteen percent of patients had disease progression following prior platinum-containing
neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. Twenty-one percent had received 2 prior systemic regimens in
the metastatic setting. Seventy-six percent of patients received prior cisplatin, 23% had prior
carboplatin, and 1% was treated with other platinum-based regimens.
The primary efficacy outcomes were OS and PFS as assessed by BICR using RECIST v1.1.
Secondary outcome measures were ORR (as assessed by BICR using RECIST v1.1) and duration of
response. Table 22 summarises the key efficacy measures for the ITT population at the final analysis.
The Kaplan-Meier curve based on the final analysis for OS is shown in Figure 18. The study
demonstrated statistically significant improvements in OS and ORR for patients randomised to
pembrolizumab as compared to chemotherapy. There was no statistically significant difference
between pembrolizumab and chemotherapy with respect to PFS.

Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were assessed using EORTC QLQ-C30. A prolonged time to
deterioration in EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status/QoL was observed for patients treated with
pembrolizumab compared to investigator’s choice chemotherapy (HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.55-0.90). Over
15 weeks of follow-up, patients treated with pembrolizumab had stable global health status/QoL,
while those treated with investigator’s choice chemotherapy had a decline in global health status/QoL.
These results should be interpreted in the context of the open-label study design and therefore taken
cautiously.
KEYNOTE-052: Open-label study in urothelial carcinoma patients ineligible for cisplatin-containing
chemotherapy
The safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab were investigated in KEYNOTE-052, a multicentre,
open-label study for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma in patients
59
 
 
 
who were not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. Patients received pembrolizumab at a
dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Treatment could
continue beyond progression if the patient was clinically stable and was considered to be deriving
clinical benefit by the investigator. Patients without disease progression could be treated for up to
24 months. The study excluded patients with autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required
immunosuppression. Assessment of tumour status was performed at 9 weeks after the first dose, then
every 6 weeks through the first year, followed by every 12 weeks thereafter. 
Among 370 patients with urothelial carcinoma who were not eligible for cisplatin-containing
chemotherapy baseline characteristics were: median age 74 years (82% age 65 or older); 77% male;
and 89% White and 7% Asian. Eighty-eight percent had M1 disease and 12% had M0 disease.
Eighty-five percent of patients had visceral metastases, including 21% with liver metastases. Reasons
for cisplatin ineligibility included: baseline creatinine clearance of < 60 mL/min (50%), ECOG
performance status of 2 (32%), ECOG performance status of 2 and baseline creatinine clearance of
< 60 mL/min (9%), and other (Class III heart failure, Grade 2 or greater peripheral neuropathy, and
Grade 2 or greater hearing loss; 9%). Ninety percent of patients were treatment naïve, and 10%
received prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy. Eighty-one percent had a
primary tumour in the lower tract, and 19% of patients had a primary tumour in the upper tract. 
The primary efficacy outcome measure was ORR as assessed by BICR using RECIST 1.1. Secondary
efficacy outcome measures were duration of response, PFS, and OS. Table 24 summarises the key
efficacy measures for the study population at the final analysis based on a median follow-up time of
11.4 months (range: 0.1, 41.2 months) for all patients.

KEYNOTE-361 is a Phase III, randomised, controlled, open-label clinical study of pembrolizumab
with or without platinum-based combination chemotherapy (i.e. either cisplatin or carboplatin with
gemcitabine) versus chemotherapy as first-line treatment in subjects with advanced or metastatic
urothelial carcinoma. Results of KEYNOTE-361 for pembrolizumab in combination with
chemotherapy did not show statistically significant improvement in PFS as assessed by BICR using
RECIST 1.1 (HR 0.78; 95% CI: 0.65, 0.93; p=0.0033), and OS (HR 0.86; 95% CI: 0.72, 1.02;
p=0.0407) versus chemotherapy alone. Per the pre-specified hierarchical testing order no formal tests
for statistical significance of pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy could be performed. The key
efficacy results of pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients for whom carboplatin rather than cisplatin
was selected by the investigator as the better choice of chemotherapy were consistent with
KEYNOTE-052 results. Efficacy results in patients whose tumours express PD-L1 with CPS ≥ 10
were similar to the overall population for whom carboplatin was selected as the choice of
chemotherapy. See Table 26 and Figures 19 and 20.

KEYNOTE-048: Controlled study of monotherapy and combination therapy in HNSCC patients naïve
to treatment in the recurrent or metastatic setting
The efficacy of pembrolizumab was investigated in KEYNOTE-048, a multicentre, randomised,
open-label, active-controlled study in patients with histologically confirmed metastatic or recurrent
HNSCC of the oral cavity, pharynx or larynx, who had not previously received systemic therapy for
recurrent or metastatic disease and who were considered incurable by local therapies. Patients with
nasopharyngeal carcinoma, active autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within two years
of treatment or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible for the study.
Randomisation was stratified by tumour PD-L1 expression (TPS ≥ 50% or < 50%), HPV status
(positive or negative), and ECOG PS (0 vs. 1). Patients were randomised 1:1:1 to one of the following
treatment arms:
• 
• 
Pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks
Pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks, carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min every 3 weeks
or cisplatin 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks, and 5-FU 1,000 mg/m2/d 4 days continuous
every 3 weeks (maximum of 6 cycles of platinum and 5-FU)
Cetuximab 400 mg/m2 load then 250 mg/m2 once weekly, carboplatin AUC
5 mg/mL/min every 3 weeks or cisplatin 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks, and 5-FU
1,000 mg/m2/d 4 days continuous every 3 weeks (maximum of 6 cycles of platinum
and 5-FU)
• 
Treatment with pembrolizumab continued until RECIST 1.1-defined progression of disease as
determined by the investigator, unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 24 months. Administration of
pembrolizumab was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression if the patient was
clinically stable and considered to be deriving clinical benefit by the investigator. Assessment of
64
 
 
 
tumour status was performed at Week 9 and then every 6 weeks for the first year, followed by every
9 weeks through 24 months. 
Among the 882 patients in KEYNOTE-048, 754 (85%) had tumours that expressed PD-L1 with a
CPS ≥ 1 based on the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDxTM Kit. The baseline characteristics of these
754 patients included: median age of 61 years (range: 20 to 94); 36% age 65 or older; 82% male; 74%
White and 19% Asian; 61% ECOG performance status of 1; and 77% former/current smokers. Disease
characteristics were: 21% HPV positive and 95% had stage IV disease (stage IVa 21%, stage IVb 6%,
and stage IVc 69%).
The primary efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS (assessed by BICR according to
RECIST 1.1). The study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS for all patients
randomised to pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy compared to standard treatment
(HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.60-0.87) and in patients whose tumours expressed PD-L1 CPS ≥ 1 randomised to
pembrolizumab monotherapy compared to standard treatment. Tables 27 and 28 summarise key
efficacy results for pembrolizumab in patients whose tumours expressed PD-L1 with a CPS ≥ 1 in
KEYNOTE-048 at the final analysis performed at a median follow-up of 13 months for
pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy and at a median follow-up of 11.5 months for
pembrolizumab monotherapy. Kaplan-Meier curves for OS based on the final analysis are shown in
Figures 21 and 22.

KEYNOTE-040: Controlled study in HNSCC patients previously treated with platinum-containing
chemotherapy
The safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab were investigated in KEYNOTE-040, a multicentre,
open-label, randomised, controlled study for the treatment of histologically confirmed recurrent or
metastatic HNSCC of the oral cavity, pharynx or larynx in patients who had disease progression on or
after platinum-containing chemotherapy administered for recurrent or metastatic HNSCC or following
platinum-containing chemotherapy administered as part of induction, concurrent, or adjuvant therapy,
and were not amenable to local therapy with curative intent. Patients were stratified by PD-L1
expression (TPS ≥ 50%), HPV status and ECOG performance status and then randomised (1:1) to
receive either pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks (n=247) or one of three standard treatments
(n=248): methotrexate 40 mg/m2 once weekly (n=64), docetaxel 75 mg/m2 once every 3 weeks (n=99),
or cetuximab 400 mg/m2 loading dose and then 250 mg/m2 once weekly (n=71). Treatment could
continue beyond progression if the patient was clinically stable and was considered to be deriving
clinical benefit by the investigator. The study excluded patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, active
autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment, a medical condition
70
 
 
 
 
 
 
that required immunosuppression, or who were previously treated with 3 or more systemic regimens
for recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC. Assessment of tumour status was performed at 9 weeks, then
every 6 weeks through Week 52, followed by every 9 weeks through 24 months.
Among the 495 patients in KEYNOTE-040, 129 (26%) had tumours that expressed PD-L1 with a
TPS ≥ 50% based on the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDxTM Kit. The baseline characteristics of these
129 patients included: median age 62 years (40% age 65 or older); 81% male; 78% White, 11% Asian,
and 2% Black; 23% and 77% with an ECOG performance status 0 or 1, respectively; and 19% with
HPV positive tumours. Sixty-seven percent (67%) of patients had M1 disease and the majority had
stage IV disease (stage IV 32%, stage IVa 14%, stage IVb 4%, and stage IVc 44%). Sixteen
percent (16%) had disease progression following platinum-containing neoadjuvant or adjuvant
chemotherapy, and 84% had received 1-2 prior systemic regimens for metastatic disease.
The primary efficacy outcome was OS in the ITT population. The initial analysis resulted in a HR for
OS of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.67, 1.01) with a one-sided p-Value of 0.0316. The median OS was 8.4 months
for pembrolizumab compared to 7.1 months for standard treatment. Table 31 summarises the key
efficacy measures for the TPS ≥ 50% population. The Kaplan-Meier curve for OS for the TPS ≥ 50%
population is shown in Figure 23.

KEYNOTE-426: Controlled study of combination therapy with axitinib in RCC patients naïve to
treatment
The efficacy of pembrolizumab in combination with axitinib was investigated in KEYNOTE-426,
a randomised, multicentre, open-label, active-controlled study conducted in patients with advanced
RCC with clear cell component, regardless of PD-L1 tumour expression status and International
Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) risk group categories. The study excluded patients with
autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression. Randomisation was
stratified by risk categories (favourable versus intermediate versus poor) and geographic region (North
America versus Western Europe versus “Rest of the World”). Patients were randomised (1:1) to one of
the following treatment arms:
• 
• 
pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks in combination with axitinib
5 mg orally, twice daily. Patients who tolerated axitinib 5 mg twice daily for
2 consecutive treatment cycles (i.e. 6 weeks) with no > Grade 2 treatment-related
adverse events to axitinib and with blood pressure well controlled to ≤ 150/90 mm Hg
were permitted dose escalation of axitinib to 7 mg twice daily. Dose escalation of
axitinib to 10 mg twice daily was permitted using the same criteria. Axitinib could be
interrupted or reduced to 3 mg twice daily and subsequently to 2 mg twice daily to
manage toxicity.
sunitinib 50 mg orally, once daily for 4 weeks and then off treatment for 2 weeks.
Treatment with pembrolizumab and axitinib continued until RECIST v1.1-defined progression of
disease as verified by BICR or confirmed by the investigator, unacceptable toxicity, or for
pembrolizumab, a maximum of 24 months. Administration of pembrolizumab and axitinib was
permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and
considered to be deriving clinical benefit by the investigator. Assessment of tumour status was
72
 
 
performed at baseline, after randomisation at Week 12, then every 6 weeks thereafter until Week 54,
and then every 12 weeks thereafter. 
A total of 861 patients were randomised. The study population characteristics were: median age of
62 years (range: 26 to 90); 38% age 65 or older; 73% male; 79% White and 16% Asian; 80% had a
Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) 90-100 and 20% had KPS 70-80; patient distribution by IMDC
risk categories was 31% favourable, 56% intermediate and 13% poor.
The primary efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS (as assessed by BICR using RECIST 1.1).
Secondary efficacy outcome measures were ORR and response duration, as assessed by BICR using
RECIST 1.1. The study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS (HR 0.53; 95% CI
0.38, 0.74; p-Value = 0.00005) and PFS (HR 0.69; 95% CI 0.56, 0.84; p-Value = 0.00012) for patients
randomised to the pembrolizumab combination arm compared with sunitinib at its pre-specified
interim analysis. Table 32 summarises key efficacy measures and Figures 24 and 25 show the
Kaplan-Meier curves for OS and PFS based on the final analysis with a median follow-up time of
37.7 months.

KEYNOTE-581 (CLEAR): Controlled study of combination therapy with lenvatinib in RCC patients
naïve to treatment
The efficacy of pembrolizumab in combination with lenvatinib was investigated in KEYNOTE-581
(CLEAR), a multicentre, open-label, randomised study conducted in 1,069 patients with advanced
RCC with clear cell component including other histological features such as sarcomatoid and papillary
in the first-line setting. Patients were enrolled regardless of PD-L1 tumour expression status. The
study excluded patients with active autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required
immunosuppression. Randomisation was stratified by geographic region (North America versus
Western Europe versus “Rest of the World”) and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC)
prognostic groups (favourable versus intermediate versus poor).
Patients were randomised (1:1:1) to one of the following treatment arms: 
•  pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks up to 24 months in combination with
lenvatinib 20 mg orally once daily.
• 
• 
lenvatinib 18 mg orally once daily in combination with everolimus 5 mg orally once daily.
sunitinib 50 mg orally once daily for 4 weeks then off treatment for 2 weeks. 
Treatment continued until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression as determined by the
investigator and confirmed by BICR using RECIST 1.1. Administration of pembrolizumab with
lenvatinib was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression if the patient was clinically
stable and considered by the investigator to be deriving clinical benefit. Pembrolizumab was continued
for a maximum of 24 months; however, treatment with lenvatinib could be continued beyond
24 months. Assessment of tumour status was performed at baseline and then every 8 weeks.
Among the study population (355 patients in the pembrolizumab with lenvatinib arm and 357 in the
sunitinib arm), the baseline characteristics were: median age of 62 years (range: 29 to 88 years), 41%
age 65 or older; 74% male; 75% White, 21% Asian, 1% Black, and 2% other races; 17% and 83% of
patients had a baseline KPS of 70 to 80 and 90 to 100, respectively; patient distribution by IMDC risk
categories was 33% favourable, 56% intermediate and 10% poor, and by MSKCC prognostic groups
was 27% favourable, 64% intermediate and 9% poor. Metastatic disease was present in 99% of the
patients and locally advanced disease was present in 1%. Common sites of metastases in patients were
lung (69%), lymph node (46%), and bone (26%).
The primary efficacy outcome measure was PFS based on BICR using RECIST 1.1. Key secondary
efficacy outcome measures included OS and ORR. The study demonstrated statistically significant
improvements in PFS (HR 0.39; 95% CI 0.32, 0.49; p-Value < 0.0001), OS (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.49,
0.88; p-Value 0.0049), and ORR (71%; [95% CI 66, 76] vs. 36%; [95% CI 31, 41]; p-Value < 0.0001)
in patients randomised to pembrolizumab in combination with lenvatinib compared with sunitinib at
the pre-specified interim analysis, with a median survival follow-up time of 26.5 months, and median
duration of treatment for pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib of 17.0 months. The primary OS analysis was
not adjusted to account for subsequent therapies.

Efficacy results for KEYNOTE-581 (CLEAR) at the protocol-specified final analysis with median
follow-up time of 49.4 months are summarised in Table 34 and Figures 26 and 27. PFS results were
consistent across pre-specified subgroups, MSKCC prognostic groups and PD-L1 tumour expression
status. Efficacy results by MSKCC prognostic group are summarised in Table 35.

KEYNOTE-564: Placebo-controlled study for the adjuvant treatment of patients with resected RCC
The efficacy of pembrolizumab was investigated as adjuvant therapy for RCC in KEYNOTE-564, a
multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 994 patients with increased risk of
recurrence defined as intermediate-high or high risk, or M1 with no evidence of disease (NED). The
intermediate-high risk category included: pT2 with Grade 4 or sarcomatoid features; pT3, any Grade
without nodal involvement (N0) or distant metastases (M0). The high risk category included: pT4, any
Grade N0 and M0; any pT, any Grade with nodal involvement and M0. The M1 NED category
included patients with metastatic disease who had undergone complete resection of primary and
metastatic lesions. Patients must have undergone a partial nephroprotective or radical complete
nephrectomy (and complete resection of solid, isolated, soft tissue metastatic lesion(s) in M1 NED
participants) with negative surgical margins ≥ 4 weeks prior to the time of screening. The study
excluded patients with active autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required
immunosuppression. Patients with RCC with clear cell component were randomised (1:1) to receive
pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks (n=496) or placebo (n=498) for up to 1 year until disease
recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. Randomisation was stratified by metastasis status (M0, M1 NED),
and within M0 group, further stratified by ECOG PS (0,1), and geographic region (US, non-US).
Starting from randomisation, patients underwent imaging every 12 weeks for the first 2 years, then
every 16 weeks from year 3 to 5, and then every 24 weeks annually.
Among the 994 patients, the baseline characteristics were: median age of 60 years (range: 25 to 84),
33% age 65 or older; 71% male; and 85% ECOG PS of 0 and 15% ECOG PS of 1. Ninety-four
percent were N0; 83% had no sarcomatoid features; 86% were pT2 with Grade 4 or sarcomatoid
features or pT3; 8% were pT4 or with nodal involvement; and 6% were M1 NED. Baseline
characteristics and demographics were generally comparable between the pembrolizumab and placebo
arms.
The primary efficacy outcome measure was investigator-assessed disease-free survival (DFS). The key
secondary outcome measure was OS. At the pre-specified interim analysis with a median follow-up
time of 23.9 months, the study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in DFS (HR 0.68;
95% CI 0.53, 0.87; p-Value = 0.0010) for patients randomised to the pembrolizumab arm compared
with placebo. Updated efficacy results with a median follow-up time of 29.7 months are summarised
in Table 36 and Figure 28.

The efficacy of pembrolizumab was investigated in KEYNOTE-177, a multicentre, randomised, open-
label, active-controlled study that enrolled patients with previously untreated metastatic MSI-H or
dMMR CRC. MSI or MMR (mismatch repair) tumour status was determined locally using polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) or IHC, respectively. Patients with autoimmune disease or a medical condition
that required immunosuppression were ineligible.
Patients were randomised (1:1) to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks or
investigator’s choice of the following chemotherapy regimens given intravenously every 2 weeks:
82
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
mFOLFOX6 (oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and FU) or mFOLFOX6 in combination with
either bevacizumab or cetuximab: Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2, leucovorin 400 mg/m2 (or
levoleucovorin 200 mg/m2), and FU 400 mg/m2 bolus on Day 1, then FU 2,400 mg/m2
over 46-48 hours. Bevacizumab 5 mg/kg bw on Day 1 or cetuximab 400 mg/m2 on
first infusion, then 250 mg/m2 weekly.
FOLFIRI (irinotecan, leucovorin, and FU) or FOLFIRI in combination with either
bevacizumab or cetuximab: Irinotecan 180 mg/m2, leucovorin 400 mg/m2 (or
levoleucovorin 200 mg/m2), and FU 400 mg/m2 bolus on Day 1, then FU 2,400 mg/m2
over 46-48 hours. Bevacizumab 5 mg/kg bw on Day 1 or cetuximab 400 mg/m2 on
first infusion, then 250 mg/m2 weekly.
Treatment with pembrolizumab continued until RECIST v1.1-defined progression of disease as
determined by the investigator or unacceptable toxicity. Patients treated with pembrolizumab without
disease progression could be treated for up to 24 months. Assessment of tumour status was performed
every 9 weeks. Patients randomised to chemotherapy were offered pembrolizumab at the time of
disease progression.
A total of 307 patients were enrolled and randomised to pembrolizumab (n=153) or chemotherapy
(n=154). The baseline characteristics of these patients were: median age of 63 years (range: 24 to 93),
47% age 65 or older; 50% male; 75% White and 16% Asian; 52% and 48% had an ECOG
performance status of 0 or 1, respectively. Mutation status: 25% BRAF V600E, 24% KRAS/NRAS.
For 143 patients treated with chemotherapy, 56% received mFOLFOX6 with or without bevacizumab
or cetuximab and 44% received FOLFIRI with or without bevacizumab or cetuximab.
The primary efficacy outcome measures were PFS assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1 and
OS. Secondary outcome measures were ORR and response duration. The study demonstrated a
statistically significant improvement in PFS (HR 0.60; 95% CI 0.45, 0.80; p-Value 0.0002) for
patients randomised to the pembrolizumab arm compared with chemotherapy at the pre-specified final
analysis for PFS. There was no statistically significant difference between pembrolizumab and
chemotherapy in the final OS analysis in which 60% of the patients who had been randomised to
receive chemotherapy had crossed over to receive subsequent anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies including
pembrolizumab. Table 37 summarises the key efficacy measures and Figures 29 and 30 show the
Kaplan-Meier curves for updated PFS and OS based on the final analysis with a median follow-up
time of 38.1 months (range: 0.2 to 58.7 months).

KEYNOTE-164: Open-label study in patients with unresectable or metastatic MSI-H or dMMR CRC
who have received prior therapy
The efficacy of pembrolizumab was investigated in KEYNOTE-164, a multicentre, non-randomised,
open-label, multi-cohort Phase II study that enrolled patients with unresectable or metastatic MSI-H or
dMMR CRC that progressed following prior fluoropyrimidine-based therapy in combination with
irinotecan and/or oxaliplatin.
Patients received pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or disease
progression. Clinically stable patients with initial evidence of disease progression were permitted to
remain on treatment until disease progression was confirmed. Patients without disease progression
were treated for up to 24 months (up to 35 cycles). Assessment of tumour status was performed every
9 weeks.
Among the 124 patients enrolled in KEYNOTE-164, the baseline characteristics were: median age
56 years (35% age 65 or older); 56% male; 68% White, 27% Asian; 41% and 59% had an ECOG
performance status of 0 and 1, respectively. Twelve percent of patients had BRAF mutations and 36%
had RAS mutations; 39% and 34% were undetermined for BRAF and RAS mutations, respectively.
Ninety-seven percent of the patients had M1 disease and 3% had M0 disease (locally advanced
unresectable). Seventy-six percent of patients received 2 or more prior lines of therapy.
The primary efficacy outcome measure was ORR as assessed by BICR using RECIST 1.1. Secondary
efficacy outcome measures included response duration, PFS, and OS. The median follow-up time in
months was 37.3 (range: 0.1 to 65.2). Efficacy results are summarised in Table 38.

MSI-H or dMMR non-CRC solid tumours enrolled in a multicentre, non-randomised, open-label
Phase II study (KEYNOTE-158), including patients with endometrial, gastric, small intestine, or
biliary cancer. MSI or MMR tumour status was determined prospectively using PCR or IHC,
respectively.
Patients received pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or disease
progression. Clinically stable patients with initial evidence of disease progression were permitted to
remain on treatment until disease progression was confirmed. Patients without disease progression
were treated for up to 24 months (up to 35 cycles). Assessment of tumour status was performed every
9 weeks through the first year, then every 12 weeks thereafter.
Among the 83 patients with endometrial cancer, the baseline characteristics were: median age of
64 years (range: 42 to 86), 46% age 65 or older; 84% White, 6% Asian, and 4% Black; and ECOG PS
0 (46%) and 1 (54%). Ninety-eight percent of the patients had M1 disease and 2% had M0 disease.
Forty-seven percent of patients received 2 or more prior lines of therapy.
Among the 51 patients with gastric cancer, the baseline characteristics were: median age 67 years
(range: 41 to 89); 57% age 65 or older; 65% male, 63% White, 28% Asian; and ECOG PS 0 (45%)
and 1 (55%). All patients had M1 disease. Forty-five percent of patients received 2 or more prior lines
of therapy.
Among the 27 patients with small intestinal cancer, the baseline characteristics were: median age
58 years (range: 21 to 77); 33% age 65 or older; 63% male, 81% White, 11% Asian; and ECOG PS 0
(56%) and 1 (44%). Ninety-six percent of patients had M1 disease and 4% M0 disease. Thirty-seven
percent of patients received 2 or more prior lines of therapy. All patients had a tumour histology of
adenocarcinoma.
Among the 22 patients with biliary cancer, the baseline characteristics were: median age 61 years
(range: 40 to 77); 41% age 65 or older; 73% male, 91% White, 9% Asian; ECOG PS 0 (45%) and 1
(55%); and 82% M1 disease and 18% M0 disease. Forty-one percent of patients received 2 or more
prior lines of therapy. 
The primary efficacy outcome measure was ORR as assessed by BICR using RECIST 1.1. Secondary
efficacy outcome measures included response duration, PFS, and OS. The median follow-up time in
87
 
 
months was 21.9 (range: 1.5 to 64.0) for endometrial, 13.9 (range: 1.1 to 66.9) for gastric, 29.1 (4.2 to
67.7) for small intestine, and 19.4 (range: 1.1 to 60.8) for biliary cancer. Efficacy results are

Oesophageal carcinoma 
KEYNOTE-590: Controlled study of combination therapy in oesophageal carcinoma patients naïve to
treatment
The efficacy of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy was investigated in
KEYNOTE-590, a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with
locally advanced unresectable or metastatic oesophageal carcinoma or GEJ carcinoma (Siewert type I).
Patients with active autoimmune disease, a medical condition that required immunosuppression, or
known HER-2 positive GEJ adenocarcinoma patients were ineligible for the study. Randomisation
was stratified by tumour histology (squamous cell carcinoma vs. adenocarcinoma), geographic region
(Asia vs. ex-Asia), and ECOG performance status (0 vs. 1).
Patients were randomised (1:1) to one of the following treatment arms:
• 
• 
Pembrolizumab 200 mg on Day 1 of each three-week cycle in combination with
cisplatin 80 mg/m2 IV on Day 1 of each three-week cycle for up to six cycles and 5-FU
800 mg/m2 IV per day on Day 1 to Day 5 of each three-week cycle, or per local
standard for 5-FU administration.
Placebo on Day 1 of each three-week cycle in combination with cisplatin 80 mg/m2 IV
on Day 1 of each three-week cycle for up to six cycles and 5-FU 800 mg/m2 IV per day
on Day 1 to Day 5 of each three-week cycle, or per local standard for 5-FU
administration.
Treatment with pembrolizumab or chemotherapy continued until unacceptable toxicity or disease
progression or a maximum of 24 months. Patients randomised to pembrolizumab were permitted to
continue beyond the first RECIST v1.1-defined disease progression if clinically stable until the first
radiographic evidence of disease progression was confirmed at least 4 weeks later with repeat
imaging. Assessment of tumour status was performed every 9 weeks. 
Among the 749 patients in KEYNOTE-590, 383 (51%) had tumours that expressed PD-L1 with a
CPS ≥ 10 based on the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDxTM Kit. The baseline characteristics of these
383 patients were: median age of 63 years (range: 28 to 89), 41% age 65 or older; 82% male;
34% White and 56% Asian; 43% and 57% had an ECOG performance status of 0 and 1, respectively.
Ninety-three percent had M1 disease. Seventy-five percent had a tumour histology of squamous cell
carcinoma, and 25% had adenocarcinoma.
88
 
 
 
 
 
The primary efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS as assessed by the investigator according to
RECIST 1.1 in squamous cell histology, CPS ≥ 10, and in all patients. The study demonstrated a
statistically significant improvement in OS and PFS for all pre-specified study populations. In all
patients randomised to pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy, compared to chemotherapy
the OS HR was 0.73 (95% CI 0.62-0.86) and the PFS HR was 0.65 (95% CI 0.55-0.76). Secondary
efficacy outcome measures were ORR and duration of response, according to RECIST 1.1 as assessed
by the investigator. Table 40 summarises key efficacy measures from the pre-specified analysis in
patients whose tumours expressed PD-L1 with a CPS ≥ 10 in KEYNOTE-590 performed at a median
follow-up time of 13.5 months (range: 0.5 to 32.7 months). The Kaplan-Meier curve for OS and PFS
are shown in Figures 31 and 32.

KEYNOTE-522: Controlled study of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy in patients with locally
advanced, inflammatory, or early-stage triple-negative breast cancer at high risk of recurrence
The efficacy of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment and then
continued as monotherapy as adjuvant treatment after surgery was investigated in the randomised,
double-blind, multicentre, placebo-controlled study KEYNOTE-522. If indicated, patients received
adjuvant radiation therapy prior to or concurrent with adjuvant pembrolizumab or placebo. The key
eligibility criteria for this study were locally advanced, inflammatory, or early-stage TNBC at high
risk of recurrence (tumour size > 1 cm but ≤ 2 cm in diameter with nodal involvement or tumour
size > 2 cm in diameter regardless of nodal involvement), regardless of tumour PD-L1 expression.
Patients with active autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment or
a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible for the study. Randomisation
was stratified by nodal status (positive vs. negative), tumour size (T1/T2 vs. T3/T4), and choice of
carboplatin (dosed every 3 weeks vs. weekly). Patients were randomised (2:1) to receive either
pembrolizumab or placebo via intravenous infusion:
o 
Four cycles of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks or placebo on Day 1
of cycles 1-4 of treatment regimen in combination with:
▪  Carboplatin
•  AUC 5 mg/mL/min every 3 weeks on Day 1 of cycles 1-4 of treatment
regimen
92
 
 
 
▪ 
▪ 
▪ 
o 
o 
or AUC 1.5 mg/mL/min every week on Day 1, 8, and 15 of cycles 1-4 of
treatment regimen and
Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 every week on Day 1, 8, and 15 of cycles 1-4 of treatment
regimen
Followed by four additional cycles of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab 200 mg every
3 weeks or placebo on Day 1 of cycles 5-8 of treatment regimen in combination with:
Doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 or epirubicin 90 mg/m2 every 3 weeks on Day 1 of
cycles 5-8 of treatment regimen and
Cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 every 3 weeks on Day 1 of cycles 5-8 of treatment
regimen
Following surgery, 9 cycles of adjuvant pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks or
placebo were administered.
Treatment with pembrolizumab or placebo continued until completion of the treatment (17 cycles),
disease progression that precludes definitive surgery, disease recurrence in the adjuvant phase, or
unacceptable toxicity. 
A total of 1,174 patients were randomised. The study population characteristics were: median age of
49 years (range: 22 to 80); 11% age 65 or older; 99.9% female; 64% White; 20% Asian, 5% Black,
and 2% American Indian or Alaska Native; ECOG performance status of 0 (87%) and 1 (13%);
56% were pre-menopausal status and 44% were post-menopausal status; 7% were primary
Tumour 1 (T1), 68% T2, 19% T3, and 7% T4; 49% were nodal involvement 0 (N0), 40% N1,
11% N2, and 0.2% N3; 1.4% of patients had inflammatory breast cancer; 75% of patients were overall
Stage II and 25% were Stage III.
The dual primary efficacy outcome measures were pathological complete response (pCR) rate and
event-free survival (EFS). pCR was defined as absence of invasive cancer in the breast and lymph
nodes (ypT0/Tis ypN0) and was assessed by the blinded local pathologist at the time of definitive
surgery. EFS was defined as the time from randomisation to the first occurrence of any of the
following events: progression of disease that precludes definitive surgery, local or distant recurrence,
second primary malignancy, or death due to any cause. The study demonstrated a statistically
significant improvement in pCR rate difference at its pre-specified primary analysis (n=602), the
pCR rates were 64.8% (95% CI: 59.9%, 69.5%) in the pembrolizumab arm and 51.2 % (95%
CI: 44.1%, 58.3%) in the placebo arm, with a treatment difference of 13.6 % (95% CI: 5.4%,
21.8%; p-Value 0.00055). The study also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in EFS
at its pre-specified analysis. A secondary efficacy outcome measure was OS. At the time of EFS
analysis, OS results were not yet mature (45% of the required events for final analysis). At a
pre-specified interim analysis, the median follow-up time for all patients was
37.8 months (range: 2.7-48 months). Table 41 summarises key efficacy measures from the
pre-specified analyses. The Kaplan-Meier curve for EFS and OS are shown in Figures 33 and 34.

KEYNOTE-355: Controlled study of combination therapy in TNBC patients previously untreated for
metastatic disease
The efficacy of pembrolizumab in combination with paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel, or gemcitabine and
carboplatin was investigated in KEYNOTE-355, a randomised, double-blind, multicentre,
placebo-controlled study. Key eligibility criteria were locally recurrent unresectable or metastatic
TNBC, regardless of tumour PD-L1 expression, not previously treated with chemotherapy in the
advanced setting. Patients with active autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within
2 years of treatment or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible.
Randomisation was stratified by chemotherapy treatment (paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel vs. gemcitabine
and carboplatin), tumour PD-L1 expression (CPS ≥ 1 vs. CPS < 1), and prior treatment with the same
class of chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting (yes vs. no). Patients were randomised (2:1) to one of
the following treatment arms via intravenous infusion:
•  Pembrolizumab 200 mg on Day 1 every 3 weeks in combination with nab-paclitaxel
100 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8 and 15 every 28 days, or paclitaxel 90 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8,
and 15 every 28 days, or gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m2 and carboplatin AUC 2 mg/mL/min
on Days 1 and 8 every 21 days.
•  Placebo on Day 1 every 3 weeks in combination with nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 on
Days 1, 8 and 15 every 28 days, or paclitaxel 90 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 every
96
 
 
 
 
28 days, or gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m2 and carboplatin AUC 2 mg/mL/min on Days 1
and 8 every 21 days.
Treatment with pembrolizumab or placebo, both in combination with chemotherapy, continued until
RECIST 1.1-defined progression of disease as determined by the investigator, unacceptable toxicity,
or a maximum of 24 months. Chemotherapy could continue per standard of care. Administration of
pembrolizumab was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression if the patient was
clinically stable and deriving clinical benefit as determined by the investigator. Assessment of tumour
status was performed at Weeks 8, 16, and 24, then every 9 weeks for the first year, and every 12 weeks
thereafter.
Among the 847 patients randomised in KEYNOTE-355, 636 (75%) had tumours that expressed PD-L1
with a CPS ≥ 1 and 323 (38%) had tumour PD-L1 expression CPS ≥ 10 based on the PD-L1
IHC 22C3 pharmDxTM Kit. The baseline characteristics of the 323 patients with tumour PD-L1
expression CPS ≥ 10 included: median age of 53 years (range: 22 to 83); 20% age 65 or older;
100% female; 69% White, 20% Asian, and 5% Black; ECOG performance status of 0 (61%) and
1 (39%); 67% were post-menopausal status; 3% had a history of brain metastases; and 20% had
disease-free interval of < 12 months.
The dual primary efficacy outcome measures were PFS as assessed by BICR using RECIST 1.1 and
OS. Secondary efficacy outcome measures were ORR and response duration as assessed by BICR
using RECIST 1.1. The study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS at its
pre-specified interim analysis (HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.49, 0.86; p-Value 0.0012) and OS at final analysis
for patients with tumour PD-L1 expression CPS ≥ 10 randomised to the pembrolizumab in
combination with chemotherapy arm compared with placebo in combination with chemotherapy.
Table 42 summarises key efficacy measures and Figures 35 and 36 show the Kaplan-Meier curves for
PFS and OS based on the final analysis with a median follow-up time of 20.2 months (range: 0.3 to
53.1 months) for patients with tumour PD-L1 expression CPS ≥ 10.

KEYNOTE-775: Controlled study of combination therapy in advanced EC patients previously treated
with systemic chemotherapy
The efficacy of pembrolizumab in combination with lenvatinib was investigated in KEYNOTE-775, a
randomised, multicentre, open-label, active-controlled study conducted in patients with advanced EC
who had been previously treated with at least one prior platinum-based chemotherapy regimen in any
setting, including in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. Participants may have received up to
2 platinum-containing therapies in total, as long as one was given in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant
treatment setting. The study excluded patients with endometrial sarcoma, carcinosarcoma, pre-existing
Grade ≥ 3 fistula, uncontrolled BP (> 150/90 mmHg), significant cardiovascular impairment or event
within previous 12 months, or patients who had active autoimmune disease or a medical condition that
required immunosuppression. Randomisation was stratified by MMR status (dMMR or pMMR
[mismatch repair proficient]) using a validated IHC test. The pMMR stratum was further stratified by
ECOG performance status, geographic region, and history of pelvic radiation. Patients were
randomised (1:1) to one of the following treatment arms:
• 
• 
pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks in combination with lenvatinib
20 mg orally once daily.
investigator’s choice consisting of either doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 every 3 weeks, or
paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 weekly, 3 weeks on/1 week off.
Treatment with pembrolizumab and lenvatinib continued until RECIST v1.1-defined progression of
disease as verified by BICR, unacceptable toxicity, or for pembrolizumab, a maximum of 24 months.
100
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Administration of study treatment was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression if the
treating investigator considered the patient to be deriving clinical benefit and the treatment was
tolerated. A total of 121/411 (29%) of the pembrolizumab and lenvatinib-treated patients received
continued study therapy beyond RECIST-defined disease progression. The median duration of the
post-progression therapy was 2.8 months. Assessment of tumour status was performed every 8 weeks.
A total of 827 patients were enrolled and randomised to pembrolizumab in combination with
lenvatinib (n=411) or investigator’s choice of doxorubicin (n=306) or paclitaxel (n=110). The baseline
characteristics of these patients were: median age of 65 years (range: 30 to 86), 50% age 65 or older;
61% White, 21% Asian, and 4% Black; ECOG PS of 0 (59%) or 1 (41%), and 84% with pMMR
tumour status and 16% with dMMR tumour status. The histologic subtypes were endometrioid
carcinoma (60%), serous (26%), clear cell carcinoma (6%), mixed (5%), and other (3%). All 827 of
these patients received prior systemic therapy for EC: 69% had one, 28% had two, and 3% had three
or more prior systemic therapies. 37% of patients received only prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy.
The primary efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS (as assessed by BICR using RECIST 1.1).
Secondary efficacy outcome measures included ORR, as assessed by BICR using RECIST 1.1. At the
pre-specified interim analysis, with a median follow-up time of 11.4 months (range: 0.3 to
26.9 months), the study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS and PFS. The pre-
specified final OS analysis with approximately 16 months of additional follow-up duration from the
interim analysis (overall median follow-up time of 14.7 months [range: 0.3 to 43.0 months]) was
performed without multiplicity adjustment. Efficacy results by MMR subgroups were consistent with
overall study results. PFS, ORR and response duration results at the interim analysis and OS results at
final analysis are summarised in Table 43. Kaplan-Meier curves for final OS and interim PFS analyses
are shown in Figures 37 and 38, respectively.

Cervical cancer
KEYNOTE-826: Controlled study of combination therapy in patients with persistent, recurrent, or
metastatic cervical cancer
The efficacy of pembrolizumab in combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin or paclitaxel and
carboplatin, with or without bevacizumab, was investigated in KEYNOTE-826, a multicentre,
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that enrolled 617 patients with persistent,
recurrent, or first-line metastatic cervical cancer who had not been treated with chemotherapy except
when used concurrently as a radio-sensitising agent. Patients were enrolled regardless of tumour
PD-L1 expression status. Patients with autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within
2 years of treatment or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible.
Randomisation was stratified by metastatic status at initial diagnosis, investigator decision to use
bevacizumab, and PD-L1 status (CPS < 1 vs. CPS 1 to < 10 vs. CPS ≥ 10). Patients were randomised
(1:1) to one of the two treatment groups:
•  Treatment Group 1: Pembrolizumab 200 mg plus chemotherapy with or without
bevacizumab
•  Treatment Group 2: Placebo plus chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab
The investigator selected one of the following four treatment regimens prior to randomisation:
1.  Paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 + cisplatin 50 mg/m2 
2.  Paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 + cisplatin 50 mg/m2 + bevacizumab 15 mg/kg
3.  Paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 + carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min
4.  Paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 + carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min + bevacizumab 15 mg/kg
All study medications were administered as an intravenous infusion. All study treatments were
administered on Day 1 of each 3-week treatment cycle. Cisplatin could be administered on Day 2 of
each 3-week treatment cycle. The option to use bevacizumab was by investigator choice prior to
104
 
 
 
 
randomisation. Treatment with pembrolizumab continued until RECIST v1.1-defined progression of
disease, unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 24 months. Administration of pembrolizumab was
permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and
considered to be deriving clinical benefit by the investigator. Assessment of tumour status was
performed at Week 9 and then every 9 weeks for the first year, followed by every 12 weeks thereafter. 
Of the 617 enrolled patients, 548 patients (89%) had tumours expressing PD-L1with a CPS ≥ 1 based
on the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDxTM Kit. Among these 548 enrolled patients with tumours expressing
PD-L1, 273 patients were randomised to pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy with or
without bevacizumab, and 275 patients were randomised to placebo in combination with
chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab. The baseline characteristics of these 548 patients were:
median age of 51 years (range: 22 to 82), 16% age 65 or older; 59% White, 18% Asian, and 1% Black;
37% Hispanic or Latino; 56% and 43% ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, respectively; 63%
received bevacizumab as study treatment; 21% with adenocarcinoma and 5% with adenosquamous
histology; for patients with persistent or recurrent disease with or without distant metastases, 39% had
received prior chemoradiation only and 17% had received prior chemoradiation plus surgery.
The primary efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS as assessed by investigator according to
RECIST v1.1. Secondary efficacy outcome measures were ORR and duration of response, according
to RECIST v1.1, as assessed by investigator. At a pre-specified interim analysis, the study
demonstrated statistically significant improvements in OS (HR 0.64; 95% CI 0.50, 0.81;
p-Value = 0.0001) and PFS (HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.50, 0.77; p-Value < 0.0001) for patients whose
tumours expressed PD-L1 with a CPS ≥ 1 randomised to pembrolizumab in combination with
chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab compared to placebo in combination with chemotherapy
with or without bevacizumab. The study also demonstrated statistically significant improvements in
OS and PFS in the overall population. Table 44 summarises key efficacy measures for patients whose
tumours expressed PD-L1 with a CPS ≥ 1 in KEYNOTE-826 at the final analysis with a median
duration of follow-up of 21.3 months. The Kaplan-Meier curves for OS and PFS based on the final
analysis are shown in Figures 39 and 40.

Gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma
KEYNOTE-811: Controlled study of combination therapy in locally advanced unresectable or
metastatic HER2-positive gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma patients naïve to
treatment
The efficacy of pembrolizumab in combination with trastuzumab plus fluoropyrimidine and platinum-
containing chemotherapy was investigated in KEYNOTE-811, a multicentre, randomised, double-
blind, placebo-controlled study that enrolled 698 patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric or GEJ
adenocarcinoma regardless of PD-L1 expression status, who had not previously received systemic
therapy for metastatic disease. Patients with an autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy
within 2 years of treatment or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible. 
Randomisation was stratified by PD-L1 expression (CPS ≥ 1 or < 1), chemotherapy regimen (5-FU
plus cisplatin [FP] or capecitabine plus oxaliplatin [CAPOX]), and geographic region
(Europe/Israel/North America/Australia, Asia or Rest of the World). Patients were randomised (1:1) to
one of the following treatment arms; all study medications, except oral capecitabine, were
administered as an intravenous infusion for every 3-week treatment cycle:
•  Pembrolizumab 200 mg, trastuzumab 8 mg/kg on first infusion and 6 mg/kg in
subsequent cycles, followed by investigator’s choice of combination chemotherapy of
cisplatin 80 mg/m2 for up to 6 cycles and 5-FU 800 mg/m2/day for 5 days (FP) or
oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 up to 6-8 cycles and capecitabine 1,000 mg/m2 bid for 14 days
(CAPOX). Pembrolizumab was administered prior to trastuzumab and chemotherapy
on Day 1 of each cycle.
107
 
 
 
•  Placebo, trastuzumab 8 mg/kg on first infusion and 6 mg/kg in subsequent cycles,
followed by investigator’s choice of combination chemotherapy of cisplatin 80 mg/m2
for up to 6 cycles and 5-FU 800 mg/m2/day for 5 days (FP) or oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2
up to 6-8 cycles and capecitabine 1,000 mg/m2 bid for 14 days (CAPOX). Placebo was
administered prior to trastuzumab and chemotherapy on Day 1 of each cycle.
Treatment with pembrolizumab, trastuzumab and chemotherapy or placebo, trastuzumab and
chemotherapy continued until RECIST v1.1-defined progression of disease as determined by BICR,
unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 24 months. Assessment of tumour status was performed every
6 weeks.
Among the 698 patients randomised in KEYNOTE-811, 594 (85%) had tumours that expressed PD-L1
with a CPS ≥ 1 based on the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDxTM kit. The baseline characteristics of the
594 patients with tumour PD-L1 expression CPS ≥ 1 included: median age of 63 years (range: 19 to
85), 43% age 65 or older; 80% male; 63% White, 33% Asian, and 0.7 % Black; 42% ECOG PS of 0
and 58% ECOG PS of 1. Ninety-eight percent of patients had metastatic disease (stage IV) and 2%
had locally advanced unresectable disease. Ninety-five percent (n=562) had tumours that were not
MSI H, 1% (n=8) had tumours that were MSI H, and in 4% (n=24) the status was not known. Eighty-
five percent of patients received CAPOX.
The primary efficacy outcome measures were PFS based on BICR using RECIST 1.1, and OS.
Secondary efficacy outcome measures included ORR and DoR based on BICR using RECIST 1.1. 
At the second interim analysis in the overall population, the study demonstrated a statistically
significant improvement in PFS (HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.60, 0.87; p-Value 0.0002) for patients
randomised to the pembrolizumab arm in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy compared
with placebo in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy. At this interim analysis, there was
no statistically significant difference with respect to OS. The median follow-up time was 15.4 months
(range: 0.3 to 41.6 months). At the first interim analysis conducted on the first 264 patients
randomised in the overall population (133 patients in the pembrolizumab arm and 131 in the placebo
arm), a statistically significant improvement was observed in ORR (74.4% vs. 51.9%, representing a
22.7% difference in ORR, [95%CI: 11.2, 33.7]; p-Value 0.00006).
Table 45 summarises key efficacy results at the second interim analysis for the pre-specified subgroup
of patients whose tumours expressed PD-L1 with a CPS ≥ 1 and Figures 41 and 42 show the
Kaplan-Meier curves for PFS and OS.

KEYNOTE-859: Controlled study of combination therapy in locally advanced unresectable or
metastatic HER2-negative gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma patients naïve to
treatment
The efficacy of pembrolizumab in combination with fluoropyrimidine and platinum chemotherapy
was investigated in KEYNOTE-859, a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled
study that enrolled 1,579 patients with HER2-negative advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma
regardless of PD-L1 expression status, who had not previously received systemic therapy for
metastatic disease. Prior neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant therapy was allowed if it was completed at least
6 months prior to randomisation. Patients with an autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy
within 2 years of treatment, a medical condition that required immunosuppression, or patients who had
received prior treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors were ineligible.
Randomisation was stratified by PD-L1 expression (CPS ≥ 1 or < 1), chemotherapy regimen (5-FU
plus cisplatin [FP] or capecitabine plus oxaliplatin [CAPOX]), and geographic region
(Europe/Israel/North America/Australia, Asia or Rest of the World).
Patients were randomised (1:1) to one of the following treatment arms; all study medications, except
oral capecitabine, were administered as an intravenous infusion for every 3-week treatment cycle:
•  Pembrolizumab 200 mg, investigator’s choice of combination chemotherapy of
cisplatin 80 mg/m2 and 5-FU 800 mg/m2/day for 5 days (FP) or oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2
111
 
 
 
and capecitabine 1,000 mg/m2 bid for 14 days (CAPOX) for up to 35 cycles. Duration
of cisplatin or oxaliplatin treatment could be capped at 6 cycles as per local country
guidelines. Pembrolizumab was administered prior to chemotherapy on Day 1 of each
cycle.
•  Placebo, investigator’s choice of combination chemotherapy of cisplatin 80 mg/m2 and
5-FU 800 mg/m2/day for 5 days (FP) or oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 and
capecitabine 1,000 mg/m2 bid for 14 days (CAPOX) for up to 35 cycles. Duration of
cisplatin or oxaliplatin treatment could be capped at 6 cycles as per local country
guidelines. Placebo was administered prior to chemotherapy on Day 1 of each cycle.
Treatment with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy or placebo and chemotherapy continued until
RECIST v1.1-defined progression of disease as determined by BICR, unacceptable toxicity, or a
maximum of 24 months. Assessment of tumour status was performed every 6 weeks. 
Among the 1,579 patients in KEYNOTE-859, 1,235 (78%) had tumours that expressed PD-L1 with a
CPS ≥ 1 based on the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDxTM kit. The baseline characteristics of the
1,235 patients with tumour PD-L1 expression CPS ≥ 1 included: median age of 62 years (range: 24 to
86), 40% age 65 or older; 70.4% male; 55.5% White; 33.1% Asian; 36.5% ECOG PS of 0 and 63.5%
ECOG PS of 1. Ninety-six percent of patients had metastatic disease (stage IV) and 4% had locally
advanced unresectable disease. Five percent (n=66) had tumours that were MSI-H. Eighty-six percent
of patients received CAPOX.
The primary efficacy outcome measure was OS. Additional secondary efficacy outcome measures
included PFS, ORR, and DOR as assessed by BICR using RECIST 1.1.
The study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS (HR 0.78; 95% CI 0.70, 0.87; p-
Value < 0.0001), PFS (HR 0.76; 95% CI 0.67, 0.85; p-Value < 0.0001) and ORR (51% [95% CI 47.7,
54.8] vs 42% [95% CI 38.5, 45.5]; p-Value 0.00009) in patients randomised to pembrolizumab in
combination with chemotherapy compared with placebo in combination with chemotherapy in the
overall population. The median follow-up time was 12 months (range: 0.1 to 45.9 months). Table 46
summarises key efficacy results for the pre-specified subgroup of patients whose tumours expressed
PD-L1 with a CPS ≥ 1 and Figures 43 and 44 show the Kaplan-Meier curves for OS and PFS.

KEYNOTE-966: Controlled study of combination therapy in patients with locally advanced
unresectable or metastatic BTC
The efficacy of pembrolizumab in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin was investigated in
KEYNOTE-966, a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that enrolled
1,069 patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic BTC, who had not received prior
systemic therapy in the advanced disease setting. Patients were enrolled regardless of tumour PD-L1
expression. Patients must have had acceptable serum bilirubin levels (≤ 1.5 x ULN or direct
bilirubin ≤ ULN for participants with total bilirubin levels > 1.5 × ULN) and any clinically significant
biliary obstruction had to be resolved before randomisation. Patients with autoimmune disease that
required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment or a medical condition that required
immunosuppression were ineligible. Randomisation was stratified by geographic region (Asia vs. non-
Asia), locally advanced versus metastatic, and site of origin (gallbladder, intrahepatic or extrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma). 
Patients were randomised (1:1) to one of the two treatment groups: 
•  Pembrolizumab 200 mg on Day 1 plus gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m2 and cisplatin 25 mg/m2
on Day 1 and Day 8 every 3 weeks
•  Placebo on Day 1 plus gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m2 and cisplatin 25 mg/m2 on Day 1 and
Day 8 every 3 weeks
All study medications were administered via intravenous infusion. Treatment was continued until
unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. For pembrolizumab, treatment was continued for a
maximum of 35 cycles, or approximately 24 months. For cisplatin, treatment could be administered
for a maximum of 8 cycles and for gemcitabine, treatment could be continued beyond 8 cycles.
Assessment of tumour status was performed at baseline and then every 6 weeks through 54 weeks
followed by every 12 weeks thereafter. 
The study population characteristics were median age of 64 years (range: 23 to 85), 47% age 65 or
older; 52% male; 49% White, 46% Asian; 46% ECOG PS of 0 and 54% ECOG PS of 1; 31% of
patients had a history of hepatitis B infection, and 3% had a history of hepatitis C infection. 
The primary efficacy outcome measure was OS and the secondary efficacy measures were PFS, ORR
and DOR as assessed by BICR using RECIST 1.1. The study demonstrated a statistically significant
improvement in OS at final analysis for patients randomised to pembrolizumab in combination with
chemotherapy compared to placebo in combination with chemotherapy. Table 48 summarises key
efficacy measures and Figures 45 and 46 show the Kaplan-Meier curves for PFS and OS based on the
final analysis with a median follow-up time of 11.6 months (range: 0.2 to 37.5 months).

Elderly population
No overall differences in safety were observed in patients ≥ 75 years of age compared to younger
patients receiving pembrolizumab monotherapy. Based on limited safety data from patients ≥ 75 years
of age, when administrated in combination with chemotherapy, pembrolizumab showed less
tolerability in patients ≥ 75 years of age compared to younger patients. For efficacy data in patients
≥ 75 years of age please refer to the relevant section of each indication.
Paediatric population
In KEYNOTE-051, 161 paediatric patients (62 children aged 9 months to less than 12 years and
99 adolescents aged 12 years to 17 years) with advanced melanoma or PD-L1 positive advanced,
relapsed, or refractory solid tumours or lymphoma were administered pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg bw
every 3 weeks. All patients received pembrolizumab for a median of 4 doses (range: 1-35 doses), with
138 patients (85.7%) receiving pembrolizumab for 2 doses or more. Participants were enrolled across
28 tumour types by primary diagnosis. The most common tumour types by histology were Hodgkin
lymphoma (13.7%), glioblastoma multiforme (9.3%), neuroblastoma (6.2%), osteosarcoma (6.2%) and
melanoma (5.6%). Of the 161 patients, 137 were enrolled with solid tumours, 22 with Hodgkin
lymphoma, and 2 with other lymphomas. In patients with solid tumours and other lymphomas, the
ORR was 5.8%, no patient had a complete response and 8 patients (5.8%) had a partial response. In
the Hodgkin lymphoma population (n=22), in patients aged 11 years to 17 years, the baseline
characteristics were median age 15 years; 64% male; 68% White; 77% had a Lansky/Karnofsky scale
90-100 and 23% had scale 70-80. Eighty-six percent had two or more prior lines of therapy and 64%
119
 
 
 
had Stage 3 or higher. In these paediatric patients with cHL, the ORR assessed by BICR according to
the IWG 2007 criteria was 54.5%, 1 patient (4.5%) had a complete response and 11 patients (50.0%)
had a partial response, and the ORR assessed by the Lugano 2014 criteria was 63.6%, 4 patients
(18.2%) had a complete response and 10 patients (45.5%) had a partial response. Data from clinical
trials in adolescent melanoma patients is very limited and extrapolation from adult data has been used
to establish efficacy. Among the 5 adolescent participants with advanced melanoma treated on
KEYNOTE-051, no patient had a complete or a partial response, and 1 patient had stable disease.
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with
pembrolizumab in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma
(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetics of pembrolizumab was studied in 2,993 patients with metastatic or unresectable
melanoma, NSCLC, or carcinoma who received doses in the range: of 1 to 10 mg/kg bw every
2 weeks, 2 to 10 mg/kg bw every 3 weeks, or 200 mg every 3 weeks.
Absorption
Pembrolizumab is administered via the intravenous route and therefore is immediately and completely
bioavailable.
Distribution
Consistent with a limited extravascular distribution, the volume of distribution of pembrolizumab at
steady-state is small (~6.0 L; CV: 20%). As expected for an antibody, pembrolizumab does not bind to
plasma proteins in a specific manner.
Biotransformation
Pembrolizumab is catabolised through non-specific pathways; metabolism does not contribute to its
clearance.
Elimination
Pembrolizumab CL is approximately 23% lower (geometric mean, 195 mL/day [CV%: 40%]) after
achieving maximal change at steady-state compared with the first dose (252 mL/day [CV%: 37%]);
this decrease in CL with time is not considered clinically meaningful. The geometric mean value
(CV%) for the terminal half-life is 22 days (32%) at steady-state.
Linearity/non-linearity
Exposure to pembrolizumab as expressed by peak concentration (Cmax) or area under the plasma
concentration time curve (AUC) increased dose proportionally within the dose range for efficacy.
Steady-state concentrations of pembrolizumab were reached by 16 weeks of repeated dosing with an
every 3 week regimen and the systemic accumulation was 2.1-fold. The median trough concentrations
(Cmin) at steady-state were approximately 22 mcg/mL at a dose of 2 mg/kg bw every 3 weeks and
29 mcg/mL at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks. The median area under the concentration time curve at
steady-state over 3 weeks (AUC0-3weeks) was 794 mcg•day/mL at a dose of 2 mg/kg bw every 3 weeks
and 1,053 mcg•day/mL at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks.
Following administration of pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks in patients with cHL, the observed
median Cmin at steady-state was up to 40% higher than that in other tumour types treated with the same
dosage; however, the range of trough concentrations is similar. There are no notable differences in
median Cmax between cHL and other tumour types. Based on available safety data in cHL and other
tumour types, these differences are not clinically meaningful.
120
Special populations
The effects of various covariates on the pharmacokinetics of pembrolizumab were assessed in
population pharmacokinetic analyses. The following factors had no clinically important effect on the
clearance of pembrolizumab: age (range: 15-94 years), gender, race, mild or moderate renal
impairment, mild or moderate hepatic impairment and tumour burden. The relationship between body
weight and clearance supports the use of either fixed dose or body weight-based dosing to provide
adequate and similar control of exposure. Pembrolizumab exposure with weight-based dosing at
2 mg/kg bw every 3 weeks in paediatric patients (≥ 3 to 17 years) are comparable to those of adults at
the same dose.
Renal impairment
The effect of renal impairment on the clearance of pembrolizumab was evaluated by population
pharmacokinetic analyses in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment compared to patients
with normal renal function. No clinically important differences in the clearance of pembrolizumab
were found between patients with mild or moderate renal impairment and patients with normal renal
function. Pembrolizumab has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (see
section 4.2). 
Hepatic impairment
The effect of hepatic impairment on the clearance of pembrolizumab was evaluated by population
pharmacokinetic analyses in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment (as defined using the
US National Cancer Institute criteria of hepatic dysfunction) compared to patients with normal hepatic
function. No clinically important differences in the clearance of pembrolizumab were found between
patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment and normal hepatic function. Pembrolizumab has
not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2).
5.3  Preclinical safety data
The safety of pembrolizumab was evaluated in a 1-month and a 6-month repeat-dose toxicity study in
Cynomolgus monkeys administered intravenous doses of 6, 40 or 200 mg/kg bw once a week in the
1-month study and once every two weeks in the 6-month study, followed by a 4-month treatment-free
period. No findings of toxicological significance were observed and the no observed adverse effect
level (NOAEL) in both studies was ≥ 200 mg/kg bw, which produced exposure multiples of 19 and
94 times the exposure in humans at doses of 10 and 2 mg/kg bw, respectively. The exposure multiple
between the NOAEL and a human dose of 200 mg was 74.
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with pembrolizumab. The PD-1/PD-L1 pathway
is thought to be involved in maintaining tolerance to the foetus throughout pregnancy. Blockade of
PD-L1 signalling has been shown in murine models of pregnancy to disrupt tolerance to the foetus and
to result in an increase in foetal loss. 
Animal fertility studies have not been conducted with pembrolizumab. In 1 month and 6 month
repeat-dose toxicology studies in monkeys, there were no notable effects in the male and female
reproductive organs; however, many animals in these studies were not sexually mature.

pembrolizumab.
Each carton contains one vial.
6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling
Do not shake the vial.
Preparation and administration of the infusion
• 
• 
• 
Equilibrate the vial to room temperature (at or below 25 °C).
Prior to dilution, the vial of liquid can be out of refrigeration (temperatures at or below 25 °C)
for up to 24 hours.
• 
• 
• 
• 
Parenteral medicinal products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and
discolouration prior to administration. The concentrate is a clear to slightly opalescent,
colourless to slightly yellow solution. Discard the vial if visible particles are observed.
Withdraw the required volume up to 4 mL (100 mg) of concentrate and transfer into an
intravenous bag containing sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) or glucose 50 mg/mL (5%) to
prepare a diluted solution with a final concentration ranging from 1 to 10 mg/mL. Each vial
contains an excess fill of 0.25 mL (total content per vial 4.25 mL) to ensure the recovery of
4 mL of concentrate. Mix diluted solution by gentle inversion.
From a microbiological point of view, the product, once diluted, should be used immediately.
The diluted solution must not be frozen. If not used immediately, chemical and physical in-use
stability of KEYTRUDA has been demonstrated for 96 hours at 2 °C to 8 °C. This 96-hour hold
may include up to 6 hours at room temperature (at or below 25 °C). If refrigerated, the vials
and/or intravenous bags must be allowed to come to room temperature prior to use. Translucent
to white proteinaceous particles may be seen in diluted solution. Administer the infusion
solution intravenously over 30 minutes using a sterile, non-pyrogenic, low-protein binding 0.2
to 5 µm in-line or add-on filter.
Do not co-administer other medicinal products through the same infusion line.

being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.
•  Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to launch of KEYTRUDA in each Member State the MAH must agree about the content and
format of the educational programme, including communication media, distribution modalities, and
any other aspects of the programme, with the National Competent Authority.
The educational programme is aimed at increasing the awareness of patients and/or their caregivers on
the signs and symptoms relevant to the early recognition/identification of the potential
immune-mediated adverse reactions (imARs).
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where KEYTRUDA is marketed, all healthcare
professionals and patients/caregivers who are expected to prescribe and use KEYTRUDA have access
to/are provided with the patient educational material.
The patient educational material should contain:
• 
The patient card 
The patient card shall contain the following key elements:
• 
Description of the main signs or symptoms of the imARs and the importance of notifying their
treating physician immediately if symptoms occur 
• 
• 
The importance of not attempting to self-treat any symptoms without consulting their healthcare
professional first
The importance of carrying the patient card at all times and to show it at all medical visits to
healthcare professionals other than the prescriber (e.g. emergency healthcare professionals).

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:
Preparation and administration of the infusion
• 
• 
• 
Do not shake the vial. 
Equilibrate the vial to room temperature (at or below 25 °C).
Prior to dilution, the vial of liquid can be out of refrigeration (temperatures at or below 25 °C)
for up to 24 hours.
Parenteral medicinal products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and
discolouration prior to administration. The concentrate is a clear to slightly opalescent,
colourless to slightly yellow solution. Discard the vial if visible particles are observed.
Withdraw the required volume up to 4 mL (100 mg) of concentrate and transfer into an
intravenous bag containing sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) or glucose 50 mg/mL (5%) to
prepare a diluted solution with a final concentration ranging from 1 to 10 mg/mL. Each vial
contains an excess fill of 0.25 mL (total content per vial 4.25 mL) to ensure the recovery of
4 mL of concentrate. Mix diluted solution by gentle inversion.
From a microbiological point of view, the product, once diluted, should be used immediately.
The diluted solution must not be frozen. If not used immediately, chemical and physical in-use
stability of KEYTRUDA has been demonstrated for 96 hours at 2 °C to 8 °C. This 96-hour hold
may include up to 6 hours at room temperature (at or below 25 °C). If refrigerated, the vials
and/or intravenous bags must be allowed to come to room temperature prior to use. Translucent
to white proteinaceous particles may be seen in diluted solution. Administer the infusion
solution intravenously over 30 minutes using a sterile, non-pyrogenic, low-protein binding 0.2
to 5 µm in-line or add-on filter.
Do not co-administer other medicinal products through the same infusion line.
KEYTRUDA is for single use only. Discard any unused portion left in the vial.
•

Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local
requirements.

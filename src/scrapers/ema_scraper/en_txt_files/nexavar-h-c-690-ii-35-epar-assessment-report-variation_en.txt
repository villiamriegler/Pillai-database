Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Bayer Pharma AG submitted to 
the European Medicines Agency on 27 June 2013 an application for a variation including an extension 
of indication. 
This application concerns the following medicinal product: 
Medicinal product: 
International non-proprietary 
Presentations: 
Nexavar 
The following variation was requested:

The MAH applied for an extension of the indication for the treatment of differentiated thyroid 
carcinoma. Consequently, the MAH proposed the update of sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of 
the SmPC.  
The Package Leaflet was proposed to be updated in accordance. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package 
Leaflet. 
Furthermore, the MAH proposed this opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template 
version 9.0. 
The variation proposed amendments to the SmPC and Package Leaflet. 
Nexavar was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/1/06/342 on 29 July 2004 and 11 April 
2006 in the following indications respectively:  treatment of renal cell carcinoma, treatment of 
hepatocellular carcinoma.  
The new indication, which is the subject of this application, falls within separate orphan designations 
EU/3/13/1199 and EU/3/13/1200 granted on 13 November 2013: treatment of follicular thyroid cancer 
and treatment of papillary thyroid cancer. Following the CHMP positive opinion on this extension of 
indication, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Nexavar 
as an orphan medicinal product in the newly approved indication. The outcome of the COMP review can 
be found on the Agency's website: ema.europa.eu/Find medicine/Rare disease designations. 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/68/2010 on the granting of a product-specific waiver.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Thyroid carcinoma is a rare disease which accounts for approximately 1% of all new malignant disease, 
including nearly 0.5% of cancers in men and 1.5% of cancers in women. In Europe, an estimated 
52,937 new cases of thyroid cancer were reported in 2012 with 6,334 deaths (EUCAN Cancer 
factsheets: Thyroid Cancer). Thyroid carcinoma is the most common form of endocrine neoplasm. 
There are three main histologic types of thyroid carcinoma: differentiated, medullary, and anaplastic. 
Approximately 94% of thyroid carcinomas are differentiated thyroid carcinomas (DTC), roughly 4% of 
thyroid carcinomas are medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTC), and the remaining 2% are anaplastic 
thyroid carcinomas (AnTC). 
DTC originates from the follicular epithelial cells of the thyroid gland, and is either papillary thyroid 
carcinoma (PTC), follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) or poorly differentiated subtype per histological 
classification. Hürthle cell thyroid carcinoma is an oncocytic variant of follicular carcinoma.

below.

Treatment of DTC encompasses surgical resection, radioactive iodine (RAI) and thyroid-stimulating 
hormone (TSH)-suppressive therapy. RAI can be curative also in patients who develop distant 
metastases. In patients no longer responding to RAI, doxorubicin is authorised in some EU Member 
States.    
An important aspect also of metastatic disease is that some patients do not require therapy for years 
due to a very indolent course. Locally advanced and metastatic RAI refractory DTC, however, is often 
associated with symptoms such as swallowing and breathing difficulties (related to cervical and lung 
metastases), pain, bone fracture, and spinal cord compressions (from bone metastases). Recurrent 
neck lesions are responsible for one-third of the cancer-related deaths while the remaining two-thirds 
are a result of distant metastases which are located in the lungs (50%), bones (25%), lungs and bones 
(20%), or at other sites (5%). 
Sorafenib, the active substance of Nexavar, is an oral multikinase inhibitor that inhibits the activity of 
targets present in the tumour cell (CRAF, BRAF, V600E BRAF, KIT, and FLT-3) and in the tumour 
vasculature (CRAF, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, and PDGFR-ß). The anti-angiogenic properties are of interest 
as VEGFs and VEGFRs often are over-expressed in cases of DTC. Inhibition of TKs upstream the 
Raf/MEK/ERK pathway might also be of interest.  
Nexavar is currently indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) 
who have failed prior interferon-alpha or interleukin-2 based therapy or are considered unsuitable for 
such therapy. Nexavar is also indicated for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The 
recommended dosage is 400 mg bid given orally as 2 tablets of 200 mg. 
The MAH applied for a new indication in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) and the proposed wording 
of the indication was:   
Nexavar

Rev.10.12  
Page 8/76 
 
 
 
 
• 
Treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid carcinoma 
refractory to radioactive iodine. 
The proposed dose to be administered is 400 mg bid which is the same dose as in RCC and HCC.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The preclinical safety profile of sorafenib was assessed at the time of initial marketing authorisation in 
mice, rats, dogs and rabbits.  
As part of this application, the applicant discussed the relevance of available non-clinical data in view 
of the applied indication in adults with advanced thyroid cancer patients and submitted a revised 
environmental risk assessment. In addition, the MAH submitted an in vitro report (PH-37402) 
investigating the influence of thyroid hormones on in vitro glucuronidation of sorafenib in human liver 
microsomes. 
2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
A significant fraction of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) are 
characterised by the presence of a RET receptor, which is constitutively activated either by various 
types of gene rearrangements (RET/PTC in PTC) or by point mutations (e.g. C634R/W or M918T 
occurring in MTCs including inherited multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A and 2B, respectively). In 
other cases PTC and ATC contain mutated BRAF. 
Sorafenib was shown to potently inhibit the enzymatic function of wild-type, mutated or RET fusion 
protein with IC50 values of ~ 7-50 nM. It also inhibited RET signalling, including receptor 
autophosphorylation and downstream signalling and cell proliferation in stably transfected cells or 
human thyroid cancer cells with activating RET mutations along with rearranged RET/PTC and mutated 
RET oncogenes with IC50 values in the lower nanomolar range. Sorafenib was also shown to potently 
inhibit BRAF, BRAFV600E and CRAF in biochemical assays with IC50 values between 6 and 38 nM. 
siRNA mediated knock-down of BRAF in the ATC cell line FRO inhibited MAPK signaling and their 
proliferation. This effect could be mimicked by sorafenib, suggesting that inhibition of BRAF and its 
mutant has therapeutic potential in thyroid cancers. Synergistic effects on the inhibition of the 
proliferation of MTC tumor cell lines were observed, when sorafenib was combined with a MEK inhibitor 
(AZD6244) but not with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus. 
In vivo, sorafenib was efficacious in an orthotopic PTC derived TPC-1 tumor model, which expresses 
the RET/PTC1 fusion protein and reduced tumor volume by 94 % compared with vehicle controls when 
dosed orally at 80 mg/kg/d. The NPA87 model tested in the same study was later identified as 
melanoma cell line. In MTC derived TT cell xenografts (RET C634W) growing subcutaneously, sorafenib 
induced tumor regression of after oral dosing at 60 mg/kg/d.  
The activity of sorafenib was also investigated in ATC derived cell lines, where it inhibited proliferation 
with IC50 values in the micromolar range and induced apoptosis up to 40 % at similar concentrations. 
Antitumor activity of sorafenib in vivo was published for the tumor cell lines ARO and DRO, but both 
cell lines were discovered later to be not of thyroid origin.  
Recent mechanism of action studies in TC cell lines have shown that mutant BRAF can prevent 
apoptosis either by NFkB mediated upregulation of TIMP-1 in the PTC cell line BCPAP or by localizing 
into mitochondria which leads to elevated glucose uptake and inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation in 
primary tumor cells and a thyroid cell line PCCL3 with inducible BRAF expression. Sorafenib was shown 
Nexavar 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/220738/2014 
Rev.10.12  
Page 9/76 
 
 
to inhibit the antiapoptotic effect in BCPAP cells, but not the effect in PCCL3 cells. Furthermore, in vitro 
studies have shown that the inhibition of the proliferation of BCPAP cells by sorafenib is reduced upon 
expression of the ubiquitin ligase SCFßTRCP, which downregulated VEGFR2 in these cells. 
In an in vitro study (PH-37402), sorafenib 5 μM was incubated for 60 minutes with pooled human liver 
microsomes together with UDPGA, and formation of M7 was measured with HPLC-MS/MS. Positive 
control niflumic acid (inhibitor of UGT1A9) caused a 90% inhibition of the reaction, whereas the thyroid 
hormones T3 and T4 at the concentrations 2-20 μM did not influence the reaction. The concentrations 
of T3 and T4 chosen were well above the physiological plasma concentrations (<0.1 nM). No signs of in 
vitro inhibition of sorafenib glucuronidation were observed either for T3 or T4. 
2.2.3.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment was evaluated and approved in 2011 for Nexavar in the 
following therapeutic indications: hepatocellular carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma. 
A refined PECsurfacewater was calculated based on maximum amount per year of sorafenib tosylate in the 
treatment of thyroid cancer (see Table 2).

2.2.4.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Available non-clinical pharmacology data support the use of sorafenib for the treatment of patients 
with thyroid cancers. In vitro and in vivo studies in mice have shown that sorafenib exerted antitumor 
activity against thyroid cancers of various subtypes.  
To explore the hypothesis of a potential inhibition of UGT1A9 by thyroxine to explain the higher 
exposure of sorafenib observed in thyroid cancer patients, a non-clinical study report (PH-37402) 
investigating the influence of thyroid hormones on in vitro glucuronidation of sorafenib in human liver 
microsomes was submitted (see also 2.3.2 pharmacokinetics aspects). Thyroid hormones T3 and T4 at 
the concentrations 2-20 μM were found not to influence the reaction.  
The environmental risk assessment for sorafenib was performed and assessed as part of previous 
procedures in relation to the approved indications hepatocellular and renal cell carcinoma 
(EMEA/H/C/690/FUM023 and FU2/023.1). A refined PECsurfacewater was calculated as part of the present 
variation. Based on the available data, sorafenib tosylate has a high affinity for soil and activated 
sludge (Koc≥10 000 L/Kg), bio-accumulates and is toxic for fish (BCF=7250; EC10<0.17 µg/L), and 
has effects on seedling growth from 100 mg/kg, when tested on barley, sugar beet and lettuce. The 
ratio PEC/PNEC surface water was identified as higher than 1.  
Considering the above data, sorafenib tosylate should be used according to the precautions stated in 
the SmPC in order to minimize any potential risks to the environment.

2.2.5.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
ERA studies have shown that sorafenib tosylate has the potential to be persistent, bioaccumulative and 
toxic to the environment (as reflected in section 5.3 of the SmPC). Any unused medicinal product or 
waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

metastatic RAI-refractory differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Patients were randomised (stratified 
according to age [< 60 years, ≥ 60 years] and geographic region [North America, Europe, Asia]) in a 
1:1 ratio.  
Methods 
Patients received sorafenib 400 mg per os (PO) (2 x 200 mg) twice daily (BID), continuous dosing 
(800 mg total daily dose) or a matching placebo. 
A single blood sample was collected from each subject to characterise the exposure in the thyroid 
cancer population, and relate exposure to measures of efficacy and safety. The Pharmacokinetic (PK) 
assessment visit was to be scheduled after at least 14 days of uninterrupted/unmodified dosing of 
study drug. Pharmacokinetic sample collection was planned for Cycle 2 Day 1 of blinded study drug 
administration. If the subject did not have at least 14 days of uninterrupted/unmodified dosing of 
study, the PK sample could have been collected at a later cycle. If a dose interruption occurred within 
14 days prior to the PK sample collection, no doses must have been missed for 3 days prior to the PK 
sample collection date, and no more than 3 doses could have been missed 4 to 14 days prior to the PK 
sample collection date. The sample was taken irrespective of time after dose, but time of dosing and 
sampling was collected. 
Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) concentrations were measured in plasma after protein precipitation with 
acetonitrile/methanol containing the internal standards followed by separation employing high-
pressure liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometric detection (LC-MS/MS). Sparse plasma 
sorafenib concentration data were used to estimate steady state sorafenib exposure (AUC(0-12),ss) using 
a concentration-exposure regression model developed using data from 218 patients in 7 previous 
studies. In this model, a concentration sample any time during the dosing interval was used to 
estimate AUC0-12,ss with a linear regression model. 
When the model was validated (leave-one-out), 30% of the estimations were outside +/-30% of the 
AUC estimated with non-compartmental data, and 18% outside +/-40%.  
The comparison with other diagnoses was performed using data from 25 other sorafenib trials, where 
the patients were administered sorafenib 400 mg BID, with samples collected following at least 7 days 
of uninterrupted dosing. AUC(0-12),ss values from the non-thyroid cancer pool were determined from 
either full concentration-time profiles using non-compartmental analysis, or sparse sampling using 
population PK analysis as described previously. 
For the exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety analyses, sorafenib AUC(0-12),ss was binned into low (1st 
quartile, N = 28), medium (2nd and 3rd quartiles, N = 57), and high (4th quartile, N = 28) exposure 
groups. AUC(0-12),ss ranges for the low, medium, and high exposure groups were 29.0-58.1, 59.2-
101.8, and 101.9-186.2 mg*h/L. For efficacy, progression free survival was compared between the 
groups using Kaplan-Meier plots. 
Results 
113 of the 207 patients in the sorafenib arm were included in the PK analysis set. When the 
comparison with other diagnoses was performed, one thyroid cancer patient from another study was 
also included (n=114).

Table 4: Summary of statistics for steady-state plasma sorafenib AUC(0-12),ss in plasma (PK analysis 
set) 
Previous examination of sorafenib exposure in Asian and Caucasian populations in different tumour 
types described the AUC(0-12),ss as 30% lower in the Asian population relative to the Caucasian 
population. In the current study, the mean AUC(0-12),ss was similar between Caucasian subjects and 
Asian subjects with thyroid cancer. 
Comparison with other diagnoses (report PH-37268) 
Mean AUC0-12h, ss for the PK population in the thyroid cancer study, calculated with the linear regression 
model, was 75 mg/lxh (CV 45%, range 29-186). This was higher than previous AUCss data from other 
tumour types, renal cancer 39 mg/lxh (CV 45%, range 11-104) and hepatocellular cancer 45 mg/lxh 
(CV 52%, range 10-242).

Analysis of sorafenib Css Values 
Additional analyses of sorafenib exposure in subjects with DTC have been completed to compare 
steady state concentration (Css) values in study 14295 to Css values in studies of other tumour types. 
In the analysis of Css values, concentration data from patients with thyroid cancer in study 14295 
(N=113) and study 100561 (N=2) were compared to sorafenib concentrations from patients with 
either HCC (N=211) or RCC (N=151) in 20 clinical trials. The patients were similar in age, weight and 
height, and included primarily Caucasian (63-77%) or Asian (20-23%) patients. Geometric mean

(range) sorafenib concentration values for each tumor type and the ratio of the geometric mean values 
(90% CI) are presented below.  
Table 5: Geometric mean sorafenib plasma concentrations (mg/L) for patients with thyroid cancer, 
HCC and RCC 
Geometric mean Css values for patients with thyroid cancer were 80% and 126% greater than Css 
values for subjects with HCC and RCC, respectively, confirming an elevation in sorafenib exposure in 
the DTC population predicted by the linear regression AUC(0 12),ss calculations.  
Population PK model (Report R-8977). 
A population PK model was developed using sorafenib data from two Phase I studies in healthy 
volunteers and eight Phase II, III and IV studies in various tumour types to investigate if any subject 
factors or combination of factors could explain the elevated plasma sorafenib concentrations observed 
in study 14295. 
The data set used for the modelling contained PK data from 648 men and 211 women (total of 3141 
plasma concentrations), with a mean age of 61.2 years. The average body weight was 75 kg for men 
and 64 kg for women. The population of 859 subjects consisted of healthy volunteers (39 subjects), 
and patients with RCC (332 patients), HCC (332 patients) and thyroid cancer (156 patients). Race was 
classified as Asian (303 subjects) or non-Asian (556 subjects). The standard dosing regimen for all the 
studies used in the analysis was 400 mg bid, though on occasion dose adjustment was necessary 
following AEs. All data were used as long as the dose and the time of the dose were retrievable for 
each plasma concentration. The final structural PK model, which was used for the covariate search, 
consisted of an absorption part with 3 sequential transit compartments, and one central PK 
compartment with linear elimination. 
The typical estimates of clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (V) were 8.08 L/h and 556 L, 
respectively. Covariates were identified in a stepwise covariate search that examined body weight, 
body mass index, race (Asian/non-Asian), gender, age, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase 
(SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH), prothrombin time - international normalized ratio (PT-INR), creatinine clearance 
(CrCL), and comedication with CYP3A4 inducers, CYP3A4 inhibitors, UGT1A9 inhibitors, UGT1A9 
inducers, or thyroxine. Subject covariates were tested on CL only, and initially co-treatment with 
thyroxine and female gender were identified as significant covariates leading to a reduction in 
clearance. Treatment with thyroxine was associated with a decrease in clearance of 43.6%, while 
females had 21.2% lower clearance compared to males (the typical estimate of clearance for males 
was 9.44 L/h and for females 7.45 L/h). This gender effect on CL implies that females are predicted to 
have on average a 26.7% higher exposure than males. Although thyroxine treatment was initially 
identified as a significant covariate, 98% of the subjects treated with thyroxine were from one study, 
study 14295. The study 14295 effect on CL was retained in the final model while the thyroxine effect 
on CL was dropped.

The table below compares the predicted steady-state exposure by tumour type using the final

Table 6: Summary statistics of individual predicted steady-state exposure by tumour type 
The CL value for subjects in study 14295 was 49.4% lower than in other trials containing subjects with 
non-thyroid tumours, which implied that subjects in study 14295 were predicted to have a 103% 
higher exposure compared to subjects in trials with tumour types such as HCC and RCC.  
PK/PD analysis (report PH-37331) 
Progression free survival was numerically higher in the high-exposure group (median PFS 509 days, 
95% CI 271-561) compared with the medium (294 days, 95% CI 231-393) and low (278 days; 95% 
CI 162-686) exposure groups. The 95% confidence intervals were however overlapping between the 
groups.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In the pivotal phase III study 14295, a single blood sample was collected from each patient to 
characterise the exposure in the thyroid cancer population, and relate exposure to measures of efficacy 
and safety. Estimating AUC using the linear regression model established based on data from other 
diagnoses was considered problematic if sorafenib clearance is different between diagnoses. In 
addition, the AUC for other populations were estimated with different methods (non-compartment 
analyses using full concentration-time curves, or population PK modelling), which could well bias the 
comparisons between diagnoses. Furthermore, 45 % of the sorafenib treated population had a dose 
interruption or modification and was not included in the PK analysis, meaning that the PK population 
was a population that tolerated the drug well and may not be representative for the whole study 
population.  
Because of these limitations, the MAH provided additional analyses of sorafenib exposure in patients 
with DTC: reanalysis of Css-values and population PK model.  
The population PK analysis was in general well performed and reported. The MAH explored possible 
covariates associated with the increased sorafenib exposure in the population PK analysis. Thyroxine 
treatment and disease (study 14295, DTC subjects) were identified as significant covariates on 
clearance. However, the effect on clearance could not be separated due to the high correlation (nearly 
100%) between the two covariates. The negative results of the covariate analysis for co-medication 
with CYP3A4 and UGT1A9 inhibitors/inducers were not considered an evidence of a non-significant 
effect on clearance since concomitant medication was evaluated as a binary variable (yes/no) with no 
information about doses of concomitant drugs, timing of doses or whether the patient has been on the 
concomitant drug for a sufficient time period at the time of blood sampling. With regards to the final 
model used in the population PK analysis, the goodness-of-fit plots revealed a reasonable fit for steady 
state data. A clear under prediction was seen for single dose data.

Overall, the additional analyses confirmed the finding that mean sorafenib exposure in patients with 
DTC is higher than that observed in other tumour types (95-126%). However, these analyses 
suggested an even higher exposure in DTC than indicated according to the linear regression model 
(68-92%).  
In relation to the PK/PD analysis, using only data from patients who tolerated the starting dose (2x400 
mg) without dose interruptions or dose adjustments also confounded the selection of patients. In 
addition, dose adjustments or interruptions after the PK sampling day were not taken into account in 
the analysis, which was considered problematic. No adjustments with respect to prognostic markers 
have been made. Therefore, the provided analysis of exposure versus efficacy was considered of very 
limited value.  
Overall, the CHMP concluded that thyroid cancer patients on average have a lower sorafenib clearance 
and/or higher bioavailability than RCC and HCC patients. The steady-state concentrations of sorafenib 
administered at 400 mg bid evaluated in DTC, RCC and HCC patients showed that the highest mean 
concentration was observed in DTC patients (approximately twice that observed in patients with RCC 
and HCC), though variability was high for all tumour types (see section 5.2 of the SmPC). In clinical 
practice, however, dose reduction based on side effects is applied, which in the long run probably will 
adjust the exposure to similar levels as in the other diagnoses. The MAH has performed additional 
analysis of clinical data (metabolite levels, plasma levels of thyroid hormones) as well as a new in vitro 
study (see non-clinical aspects), but has not been able to explain the higher sorafenib exposure in 
thyroid cancer patients compared to patients with HCC or RCC. The MAH is recommended to undertake 
further PK studies aiming at clarifying the grounds for the increased exposure from a mechanistic 
perspective. A clinical study with full PK profiling before and after initiation of levothyroxin treatment 
could clarify whether it is the hyperthyroidism that leads to higher drug exposure, as well as if a higher 
exposure is due to higher bioavailability or lower clearance. Further investigations on the underlying 
biological mechanism are also encouraged. 
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
A higher exposure was observed in DTC patients compared to other RCC and HCC patients. The 
increase is estimated to be 95-126%, which is now reflected in the SmPC as a mean exposure twice as 
that observed in RCC and HCC. This higher exposure in these DTC patients probably contributes to a 
higher rate of adverse events, but in the clinic it is handled with dose reductions based on toxicity 
which was considered appropriate by the CHMP.  
In addition, the CHMP recommends the MAH to undertake further PK studies aiming at clarifying the 
grounds for the increased exposure from a mechanistic perspective as such data might have a bearing 
for other interactions. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main study 
Pivotal study 14295 “Decision” 
Study 14295 was a double-blind, randomised phase III study evaluating the efficacy and safety of 
sorafenib compared to placebo in locally advanced/metastatic Radioactive Iodine (RAI)-refractory 
Differentiated Thyroid Cancer (DTC).

Methods 
Study participants 
Inclusion criteria specified that only patients with DTC (papillary, follicular, Hürthle cell, and poorly 
differentiated carcinoma) with disease progression within 14 months of enrolment could be included in 
the study. 
Another key inclusion criterion was that only patients refractory to RAI could be enrolled. 
The definition of DTC refractory to RAI was defined as follows: Patients had to have a target lesion (per 
RECIST v1.0 criteria) with no iodine uptake on a diagnostic or therapeutic whole body post-RAI scan 
performed under conditions of a low iodine diet and adequate thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) 
elevation or recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) stimulation. 
Certain patients whose tumours had iodine uptake were also eligible for participation. They included 
the following categories of patients: 
- Patients who have some iodine uptake, who had RAI treatment ≥3.7 GBq [≥100 mCi] (performed 
under conditions of a low iodine diet and adequate TSH elevation or rhTSH stimulation) within the last 
16 months, and progression of target lesions after RAI;  
or 
- Patients who have some iodine uptake, who have had multiple RAI treatments, whose last RAI 
treatment was >16 months ago, and who had progression after each of two RAI treatments (≥3.7 GBq 
[≥100 mCi] each) that were done within 16 months of each other and which were each performed 
under the conditions of a low iodine diet and adequate TSH elevation or rhTSH stimulation; 
or  
- Any individual patients who had received RAI treatments with a cumulative dose ≥22.2 GBq (≥600 
mCi). 
Patients must have had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2; 
adequate thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression (< 0.5 mU/L); and adequate bone marrow, liver, 
and renal function. 
Patients were excluded if they had been treated for cancer with any licensed or investigational tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors; monoclonal antibodies that target vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or VEGF 
receptors, or other targeted agents; anti-cancer treatment for thyroid carcinoma using cytotoxic 
chemotherapy agents (except for prior low-dose chemotherapy for radiosensitisation), or thalidomide 
or any of its derivatives. 
Treatments 
Treatments consisted in matching placebo or sorafenib 400 mg twice daily. Study medication was 
administered on a continuous basis until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, noncompliance, or 
withdrawal of consent. A cycle of therapy was defined as 28 days. 
Dose interruption and reductions were allowed under certain circumstances. 
Patients were allowed to be unblinded and receive open label sorafenib after experiencing a disease 
progression at the investigator’s discretion, regardless of their initial blinded treatment assignment.

Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to compare treatment groups in terms of progression free 
survival (PFS). The targeted improvement of 3.3 months in median PFS in the sorafenib arm (over the 
assumed placebo median PFS of 6 months) was selected. 
The secondary objectives were to compare the treatment groups in terms of overall survival, time to 
progression, disease control rate, response rate, duration of response, safety, and exposure of 
sorafenib as measured by AUC0-12. 
The exploratory objectives were assessment of health utility values, health-related quality of life, 
biomarker analysis and PFS after unblinding until further disease progression. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Clinical efficacy 
The primary efficacy endpoint was progression free survival (PFS). 
PFS was defined as the time from date of randomisation to date of first observed disease progression 
(radiological as determined by central radiological review or clinical progression due to bone lesions 
that required external radiation, whichever was earlier) or death (due to any cause) if it occurred 
before progression was documented. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints were: Overall survival (OS), Time to progression (TTP), disease 
control rate (DCR), response rate (RR), duration of response (DOR). 
OS was defined as the time from date of randomisation to date of death due to any cause. 
TTP was defined by the same rule as PFS, except that death did not count as an event. 
DCR was defined as the proportion of patients whose best response was complete response (CR), 
partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) that was achieved before or at the date of unblinding. Per 
RECIST 1.0, CR and PR were to be confirmed by another scan at least 4 weeks later. SD had to be 
documented at least 4 weeks after baseline. 
RR was defined as the proportion of patients whose best response was CR or PR that was achieved 
before or at the date of unblinding. Per RECIST 1.0, CR and PR were to be confirmed by another scan 
at least 4 weeks later. 
DOR was defined as the time from the first documented objective response of PR or CR, whichever was 
noted earlier, to disease progression or death (if death occurred before progression was documented). 
The exploratory efficacy variables were: Health Utility Values, Health related quality of life (HRQoL), 
PFS after unblinding until further disease progression in subjects who had received sorafenib and 
continue sorafenib treatment, PFS after unblinding until further disease progression in subjects who 
had received placebo and crossover to sorafenib treatment. 
SPFS was defined as time from re-baseline until new progression or death, whichever came first, 
during or after open-label treatment with sorafenib. For independent review the last tumour 
assessment before start of open-label treatment period was used as rebaseline. Local investigator 
flagged in the database the tumour images that were used as new baseline for the open-label period. 
Secondary PFS was analysed descriptively.

Health Utility Values were measured using the EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), and to analyse Health 
Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), the EQ-5D and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy General 
Version 4.0 (FACT-G) were used. 
For the EQ-5D, higher scores represent better health status. A change of at least 0.10 to 0.12 points 
on the EQ-5D index was considered clinically meaningful (using ECOG PS as the anchor). For EQ-5D 
VAS questionnaire a change of at least 7 points on the VAS was considered as clinically meaningful. 
The total score of the FACT-G ranged from 0 to 108; the higher the score, the better the QoL. 
Important difference for the FACT-G total score was 3 to 7 points. 
Clinical pharmacology:  
Sparse plasma sorafenib concentration data were collected for pharmacokinetic analysis. Results of this 
analysis are reported under section 2.3.2. 
Sample size 
Sample size was based on the primary efficacy endpoint PFS. Assuming a one-sided alpha of 0.01, a 
power of 90%, 55.5% increase in median time to PFS, and a randomisation ratio of 1:1 between the 
experimental and the control arm, 267 events were required. 420 subjects had to be enrolled to 
observe 267 events after approximately 29 months. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomised via IVRS using a 1:1 allocation of patients to either of sorafenib or placebo. 
Patients were stratified at randomisation according to: 
•  Age (< 60 years versus ≥ 60 years) 
•  Geographical region (North America versus Europe versus Asia) 
Blinding (masking) 
Blinded independent central review (BICR) was undertaken: The first examination (screening) was 
interpreted without knowledge of future time points and an electronic imaging CRF (eICRF) was 
completed. Only after the screening eICRF was locked and submitted the radiologist proceeded to the 
next imaging time point. The process was repeated for every time point until completion of the primary 
radiology review for a given case. 
Patients were allowed to be unblinded and receive open label sorafenib after experiencing a disease 
progression. 
Statistical methods 
The primary population for efficacy analysis was the full analysis set (FAS) population, which was 
defined as all randomised patients. The FAS was identical with the intent to treat (ITT) analysis set. 
The analysis for PFS was to be performed when approximately 267 subjects had a PFS event per 
central assessment. The two treatment groups (sorafenib and placebo) were compared using a 
stratified one-sided log rank test with an overall alpha of 0.01 stratified by the same stratification 
factors as used for randomisation.

The secondary efficacy variables OS, TTP, RR, and DCR were tested using a one-sided significance level 
of 0.025 (α = 0.025). 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 556 subjects were screened for inclusion into the study; 137 subjects failed screening for the 
following reasons: Protocol violation in 124 (22.3%) subjects, the majority of which were 
inclusion/exclusion criteria violations; Consent withdrawn by 9 (1.6%) subjects; AEs in 4 (0.7%) 
subjects. 
A total of 419 subjects were randomised to double-blind treatment; 209 were randomised to receive 
sorafenib and 210 were randomised to receive placebo. Since 2 subjects were erroneously randomised 
the first time to sorafenib, 207 sorafenib subjects and 210 placebo subjects were considered valid for 
the FAS.

Following discontinuation of treatment (either from the double-blind or open-label period), subjects 
were followed for safety until 30 days after end of treatment or until the end of study, and further 
followed every 3 months for survival and any post-study anti-cancer therapy until the final analysis of 
OS was performed.

Among 556 subjects enrolled, 337 were enrolled in Europe, 97 in North America and 122 in Asia. 
Conduct of the study 
There were altogether 9 amendments, mainly of clarifying nature and three of the amendments were 
locally valid only (JPN, UK and AU). Amendment 9 (after data analysis) opened the study for cross-
over prior to progression.

Table 10: Prior anti-cancer therapy and surgical therapeutic procedures (FAS) 
There was no systematic collection of data about the presence or absence of thyroid cancer related 
symptoms in the case report forms at baseline, during the study and at the time of progression. 
The MAH has retrospectively reviewed MedDRA preferred terms considered likely to be thyroid cancer 
related: dyspnea, dyspnea exertional, pleural effusion, dysphagia, hemoptysis, chest pain, bone pain, 
tumour pain, spinal cord compression, cough, obstructive airways disorder, pulmonary embolism.  
Overall, 84 (20.1%) subjects had a medical history finding reported using terms that are likely to be 
related to thyroid cancer. There were 12 subjects (2.9%), who experienced a new AE or experienced a 
worsening of an existing medical history finding during the screening period (up to 28 days). In 
addition 34% were taking analgesic or anti-inflammatory medications.

The vast majority of patients in both treatment groups were censored due to no progression or death 
up to the last tumour assessment (even though tumour assessment was performed post baseline) 
(sorafenib, 72 (34.8%) subjects; placebo, 64 (30.5%) subjects).

•  Secondary PFS (SPFS)  
In the sorafenib arm, 55 patients (27%) started open label treatment with sorafenib. 23 patients 
entered open label treatment after disease progression. 9 patients received continued therapy after 
disease progression without a second event of PFS.

The results for patients who were retrospectively categorized as symptomatic at baseline (median PFS 
sorafenib, 326 days; placebo, 109 days, HR [95%CI] 0.386 [0.207; 0.720]) were numerically superior 
to the results in asymptomatic patients (median PFS sorafenib 329 days, placebo 220 days HR

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Overall, the design of the pivotal study is considered conventional and acceptable. Progression within 
14 months as inclusion criterion might appear long, but is commonly used in metastatic DTC. Of note, 
symptomatic disease was not required. The definition of Radioactive Iodine (RAI)-Refractory 
differentiated thyroid cancer is also considered appropriate. The study included optional cross-over as

off label use of alternative TKIs (and sorafenib) was foreseen to be prevalent at least in the US. This is 
not considered ideal but is accepted by the CHMP. 
In terms of demographic and baseline characteristics data, the vast majority of patients had metastatic 
disease and few patients entered the study with stable disease (i.e. non-progression within 
14 months). Time of documented progressive disease until enrolment was not reported. Poorly 
differentiated tumours were eligible provided that the histology had neither medullary differentiation 
nor anaplastic features. Overall, no imbalances of likely importance were observed. 
The median PFS was 10.8 months for sorafenib treated group compared with 5.8 months in the 
placebo group (HR: 0.587; 95%CI 0.454 – 0.758; p-value <0.0001). The results were considered 
clinically and statistically robust.  
There were no particular findings as regards differential sorafenib activity in subgroups analysis. With 
respect to prognosis, low tumour burden (target lesions < median), lung only and papillary histology 
appeared to be associated with relatively good prognosis as expected. This might also be the case for 
the subgroup “Asia” however the numbers are too small to draw conclusions. PFS was also analysed 
post-hoc for additional subgroups. A post-hoc subgroup analysis by maximum tumour size showed a 
treatment effect for PFS in favour of sorafenib over placebo for patients with maximum tumour size of 
1.5 cm or larger (HR 0.54 (95% CI: 0.41 - 0.71)) whereas a numerically lower effect was reported in 
patients with a maximum tumour size of less than 1.5 cm (HR 0.87 (95% CI: 0.40 - 1.89). Before 
initiating treatment, physicians are recommended to carefully evaluate the prognosis in the individual 
patient considering maximum lesion size, symptoms related to the disease and progression rate (see 
section 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC). 
In the updated OS analysis (cut-off May 2013), the event rate was 32% and 34%, respectively, with 
an HR of 0.884 (95%CI 0.633 - 1.236). This is expected in a slowly progressive disease with a high 
cross-over rate. 
The response rate was low, about 12%, compared with single arm study data, about 25%. Due to the 
rather slowly progressive nature of the disease, stable disease (SD) as defined here 4 weeks, is not 
considered informative.  
This study opened for optional open label treatment of sorafenib also after disease progression on 
sorafenib and cross over from placebo to sorafenib. Altogether, about 27% of patients entered open 
label treatment from the sorafenib arm and 71% of patients cross over from the placebo group. The 
median PFS after cross-over (SPFS) from placebo was about 10 months which was rather similar to 
PFS first-line in the sorafenib arm.  
With respect to patient reported outcome (PRO), a negative effect was observed in the sorafenib arm 
on the EQ-5D index. This was not unexpected taking adverse reactions into account (see also clinical 
safety). Also EQ-5D VAS seemed to capture negative effects. In terms of FACT-G score, a small but 
likely relevant difference in total score in favour of placebo, driven by “physical well-being”, was 
observed. HRQoL as estimated by EQ-5D and FACT-G decreased early and then remained stable 
despite dose reductions. The MAH discussed PRO items that were likely to be sensitive to the reported 
adverse reactions. Items in EQ-5D sensitive to adverse reactions included mobility, usual activities and 
pain/discomfort. Most issues in the physical well-being domain of FACT-G seemed sensitive to AEs, 
most notable “bothered by side effects” where “quite a bit” and “very much” increased from 2% prior 
to cycle 1, to about 30% prior to cycle 2 and about 25% prior to cycle 3. Despite dose reductions and 
interruptions, about 15% of the patients reported after cycle 6 that they were quite a bit or very much 
bothered by side effects. On the other hand about 55% were not at all or a little bit bothered at cycle 6 
and on.

Analyses of FACT-G total score revealed that changes in the HRQoL on an individual subject level were 
heterogeneous. About 50% of patients showed a more than 7 points (“minimally important difference”) 
decrease in total score and about 15% showed an improvement.  
The case report form (CRF) did not capture symptoms likely to be related to the underlying disease, 
but retrospectively it was found that about 20% of patients had symptoms likely to be related to 
thyroid cancer at baseline. Positive effects on total EQ-5D or FACT-G were not reported in this group of 
patients, but PFS tended to be more favourable (HR [95%CI] 0.386 [0.207; 0.720] compared to 
asymptomatic patients (HR [95%CI] 0.602 [0.448; 0.807]). In the placebo group median time to PFS 
was shorter than in the full study population partially ”validating” the more advanced stage of 
”symptomatic” patients. 
Progression rate is also likely to be of importance, but no such data are available. Patients enrolled 
within 3 months of documented progression, however, had a slightly better HR than the 
complementary set. 
The MAH undertook additional subgroup analyses, and no baseline factors predictive of HRQoL on 
therapy have been identified.  
It is accepted that delaying tumour progression is likely to be associated with delaying symptomatic 
progression. However, the clinical benefit and appropriateness of initiating therapy in asymptomatic 
patients was questioned, not least as sorafenib is associated with adverse reactions negatively 
affecting patients HRQoL. By necessity, this should be an individualised decision taking into account 
tumour progression rate, organ involvement, patient wish, etc. No co-variates predictive of sorafenib 
anti-tumour activity have been identified and delay in initiation of treatment seems unlikely to be an 
issue. In this context, the indication has been revised to reflect that sorafenib is for use in patients 
with progressive RAI refractory DTC.  
In the pivotal study and as expected papillary dominated (about 60%), followed by follicular/Hürthle 
cell (18%), poorly differentiated (about 10%) and “follicular other” (6%). Statistically significant and 
similar effects were observed in “papillary” and “follicular-Hürthle cell” (HR was 0.52 and 0.44, 
respectively), whilst the point estimates were a bit poorer (HR of 0.74 and 0.73, respectively) and not 
statistically significant in “poorly differentiated” and “follicular other”. Hürthle cell is considered a 
variant of follicular and clinically it is not meaningful to differentiate between these entities, especially 
not in case of RAI refractory disease. Therefore, “poorly differentiated” is excluded from the indication 
(see section 4.2 of the SmPC). 
With respect to the exploratory biomarker analysis performed in the pivotal study, archival samples 
provided no mutation data of potential interest as regards predictive or prognostic value. Plasma 
biomarkers, including factors considered to be of importance for angiogenesis, have not been analysed 
yet and should be submitted as soon as available.  
Data from five single centre, single arm, investigator sponsored studies were also submitted as 
supportive information. As frequently is the case, higher ORR were reported in these single arm, single 
centre studies. These studies, however, only provide supportive evidence of activity in RAI refractory 
DTC. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Sorafenib has shown a clinically meaningful benefit in patients with metastatic differentiated thyroid 
cancer refractory to radioiodine therapy, with a difference of 5 months in median PFS in comparison to 
placebo (HR: 0.587; 95%CI 0.454 – 0.758; p-value <0.0001).

Page 43/76 
 
 
EQ-5D and FACT-G data were compatible with a negative effect of sorafenib on HRQoL. Baseline 
factors predictive of increased risk have not been identified, but it should be noticed that about half of 
the patients were ‘not at all’ or ‘only a bit bothered’ by side effects and that dose reductions were only 
partly successful in alleviating symptoms. Repeat evaluation of benefit and risk is recommended taking 
anti-tumour activity and tolerability into account (see section 4.4 of the SmPC).   
Factors such as size of tumour lesions and symptoms are considered important to be taken into 
account prior to initiation of therapy. Progression rate is also likely to be of importance although no 
such data were available. Patients enrolled within 3 months of documented progression, however, had 
a slightly better HR than the complementary set. Therefore, the CHMP considered the prognosis in the 
individual patient considering maximum lesion size, symptoms related to the disease and progression 
rate should be carefully considered before initiating treatment with sorafenib (see section 4.4 of the 
SmPC).  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Patient exposure 
Overall, approximately 15,715 patients with cancer, including 366 patients with DTC, have been 
exposed to sorafenib in MAH-sponsored trials up to March 2013. The completed studies, including 
phase 2 ISS studies, comprise treatment with sorafenib in 527 patients with DTC. In addition, 
1739 patients with thyroid carcinoma have been treated with sorafenib in a US patient support 
program. 
As of March 2013, the total estimated worldwide exposure to commercial sorafenib and sorafenib in 
clinical studies is over 293,000 patients. 
Study 14295 
A total of 417 patients (sorafenib 207; placebo 210) were randomised into Study 14295 but 1 placebo 
patient initiated double-blind treatment. Thus, the safety analysis set (SAF) was comprised of 
416 patients. 
In the open label phase of the study, 150 patients randomised to placebo received open label 
sorafenib, therefore the number of patients exposed to sorafenib in study 14295 is 357. Sorafenib 
patients received a mean of 81.4% of the planned dose and placebo patients received a mean of 
99.2% of the planned dose. One hundred forty-one patients (68.1%) experienced at least one dose 
reduction of double blind sorafenib compared to 11.5% of patients with at least one dose reduction of 
double blind placebo. The most common reason for dose reduction of double-blind drug was an AE 
(73.9% in sorafenib patients and 57.1% placebo patients). At least one dose interruption was also 
more common in sorafenib patients compared to placebo patients (76.8% and 54.5%, respectively). 
The predominant reason for interruption in sorafenib patients was an AE (75.3%). 
The median duration of therapy in the double-blind period was 46 weeks (range 0.3-135) for patients 
receiving sorafenib and 28 weeks (range 1.7–132) for patients receiving placebo.

New events of rash peaked during the first treatment cycle and new events grade 3 or more were 
uncommon after the first cycle. After cycle 2, the prevalence of rash grade 1 dominated. The reduced 
prevalence of grade 2 and higher events probably reflects dose reductions. 
The incidence of hand foot skin reactions showed a similar patter to rash, onset mainly during cycle 
one with a total incidence of 50+%, equally divided between grade 1, 2 and 3. 
The prevalence of hand foot skin reactions peaked later compared with rash. In late cycles, grade 2 
events were seen in about 8% of patients (skin changes with pain limiting instrumental ADL). 
Most instances of diarrhoea in sorafenib-treated subjects started early in treatment, particularly in the 
first cycle of treatment. New occurrences appeared in each cycle of treatment, but these were occurred 
at less than half the rate observed in Cycle 1. New onset may occur later than skin reactions, 
encompassing also grade 2 events (increase of 4-6 stools per day). In sorafenib-treated subjects, the 
prevalence of diarrhoea gradually increased until Cycle 6 and then remained stable thereafter. Despite 
dose reductions and interruptions, the prevalence of diarrhoea increased over time and grade 2 and 3 
seemed not to decrease. 
Fatigue was an early new event; cycle 1 dominated, also with respect to new onset grade 2 and 3 
(3=not relieved by rest, limiting self-care ADL). Fatigue remained rather stable over time at about 
twice the level seen in the placebo group. Grade 1 dominated (relieved by rest). 
Weight loss was cumulative. From cycle 7 and on about 20% of the patients showed grade 2 weight 
loss (10 - <20% from baseline).

Recording increased TSH > 0.5 mU/L as an adverse event was a study specific AE. The definition of 
this event was based on the need to suppress TSH as part of standard of care for differentiated thyroid 
cancer. Elevations of TSH above 0.5 mU/L were requested to be recorded as Grade 1 AEs based solely 
on laboratory findings.  
New cases of TSH >0.5 mU/L were recruited over the full study period, the prevalence maximum was 
reached at cycle 5, about 18%. 
The prevalence of hypocalcaemia was rather stable from cycle 3 and grade 3 or more was reported in 
about 2% of patients (grade 3 < 7 mg/mL, grade 4 <6 mg/mL). One event of hypocalcaemia resulted 
in discontinuation of sorafenib and one case was reported as a serious event.    
The overall prevalence of hypertension was rather stable, grade 3 about 3% (>160 or >100 mm Hg, 
intensified therapy, e.g. more than one drug indicated, perhaps not too frightening from an oncology 
perspective).  
Subjects received concomitant medications to mitigate hypertension. Overall, 6 (2.9%) subjects in the 
sorafenib group and 9 (4.3%) subjects in the placebo group received anti-hypertensives during the 
study and a total of 4 (1.9%) subjects in the sorafenib group and 3 (1.4%) subjects in the placebo 
group received new anti-hypertensives during the study, suggesting that most instances of 
hypertension did not require pharmacological treatment.

Two deaths were considered related to the study drug by the investigators: 
A 52-year-old Caucasian male died of a myocardial infarction (MI) that was considered to be related to 
the study drug as well as the underlying condition, although obesity, ex-smoker, advanced thyroid 
carcinoma with hypothyroidism, heartburn, and hypertension were also cited.  
The subject died during cycle 16, 427 days after initiating treatment. Double-blind treatment at 800 
mg sorafenib daily was ongoing at the time of death.  
A 73-year-old Caucasian female died of a subdural hematoma that was considered to be related to the 
study drug as well as the underlying condition. During cycle 11, the subject fell and hit her head. She 
was hospitalized and a large subdural hematoma was diagnosed. A CT of the cervical spine (without

suspicious for bony metastases, and probably a second metastatic lesion involving the occipital bone.  
Abnormal laboratory values included: prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT): 35.8

Squamous cell carcinoma skin 
A product specific search using the term keratoacanthoma /squamous cell carcinoma that occurred in 
the both double-blind and open-label period of study 14295 was conducted. In 8 subjects treated with 
sorafenib, grade 3 squamous cell carcinoma of skin was reported 8.6 to 84 weeks following start of 
treatment: 3 subjects, 8.6, 10.3, and 12.4 weeks; 2 subjects, 28 – 29.9 weeks; and 3 subjects, 41.9, 
55.3, and 84 weeks after start of treatment. The subjects all recovered/ event was resolved. There 
were no reports of grade 3 squamous cell carcinoma in subjects treated with placebo. 
Grade 1 keratoacanthoma was reported in 6 subjects treated with sorafenib, 3 subjects randomized to 
sorafenib, and 3 subjects randomized to placebo with events reported following the start of open-label 
sorafenib. The grade 1 keratoacanthomas occurred 2.6 to 31.7 weeks following start of sorafenib 
treatment (either double-blind or open-label); in 2 subjects 2.6 and 4.1 weeks, 3 subjects 12.4 – 18.4 
weeks, and in one subject 31.7 weeks. Grade 1 keratoacanthoma was reported in 1 subject 49.7 
weeks following start of treatment with placebo (this subject did not receive open-label sorafenib). 
Grade 2 keratoacanthoma was reported in two subjects randomized to sorafenib (duration of exposure 
was 80.4 weeks and could not be calculated due to missing date of onset following the start of 
sorafenib therapy). The outcome of these AEs was recovered/resolved in all cases except one where 
the outcome was not reported.

Laboratory findings 
Hematology: Overall, the mean changes from baseline were modest illustrating that most patients had 
no or low grade events. 
Thyroid function: TSH levels were intentionally therapeutically brought to below normal levels 
(inclusion criteria TSH < 0.5 mIU/L) and patients in this study were to be maintained at TSH <0.5 
mIU/L. Those patients whose TSH values rose above this threshold were reported using the protocol-
specified AE which was coded to term “blood TSH increased” though this designation was not 
consistent with a patient having TSH levels that were above normal limits. Based upon these criteria, 
the incidence of blood TSH increased during the double-blind period was 33.3% in sorafenib-treated 
patients versus 13.4% in placebo-treated patients The greater incidence of TSH > 0.5 mIU/L in 
patients who received treatment with sorafenib was anticipated based on the observation that 
sorafenib is believed to enhance T4 and T3 metabolism by possibly increasing type-3 deiodination and 
by a sorafenib-related decrease in the clearance of thyrotropin  
Other clinical chemistry measurements: During the double-blind period, the most commonly observed 
biochemical abnormalities (> 30% patients) in the sorafenib group were: elevation of ALT (58.9%), 
elevation of AST (53.6%), hyperglycaemia (52.7%), and hypocalcaemia (35.7%).  
Grade 3 or 4 toxicities were uncommon. Grade 3 events which occurred in more than 1 patient who 
received treatment with sorafenib were observed for hypophosphatemia (12.6%), hypocalcaemia 
(6.8%), ALT (3.4%), hyperglycaemia (2.9%), hyponatraemia (2.9%), amylase (2.4%), lipase (2.4%), 
hypokalaemia (1.9%), and AST (1.0%).  
Grade 4 biochemical abnormalities that occurred in more than 1 patient during the double-blind 
treatment period were: hypocalcemia (3.4%), amylase (1.4%), ALT (1.0%), AST (1.0%), and 
hyperkalaemia (1.0%). Clinically, these abnormalities had limited impact, as evidenced by the low rate 
of treatment discontinuation due to AEs based on laboratory abnormalities.

Table 42: Study 14295 - Incidence of AEs by MedDRA PT Leading to Dose Reduction of Study Drug in 
≥ 2 Subjects 
The most common reason for dose reduction for both grade 3 and grade 2 adverse events was hand 
foot skin reaction. Among the 56 subjects whose initial dose reduction was for a grade 3 AE, 27 had 
HFSR as reason for dose reduction. Among the 70 subjects whose initial dose reduction was for a 
grade 2 event, 25 had HFSR as reason for the dose reduction. Following dose reduction for HFSR, 
investigators commonly attempted dose re-escalation (59% of subjects following a grade 3 HFSR event 
and 68% of the subjects following a grade 2 adverse event). 
Data on the grade of rash, HFSR, diarrhoea and fatigue after first dose reduction or dose interruption 
followed by dose reduction caused by the following AEs (grade 2 and 3): rash, hand foot skin 
reactions, diarrhoea and fatigue, were submitted. As the patterns of AEs post dose reduction were 
rather similar, only reductions caused by HFSR are presented.

(full analysis set/cut-off 31 August 2012) 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Median duration of therapy in the DTC study was clearly longer than in hepatocellular cancer (HCC), 
but reasonably comparable to renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Despite this, dose reductions/interruptions 
were more frequently undertaken in the DTC study and median dose intensity was lower.   
Due to adverse reactions it is expected that double blind conditions in study 14295 were protected only 
in a rather small proportion of sorafenib patients. About 60% of patients experience grade 3/4 adverse 
events (AEs)/Adverse drug reactions on treatment with sorafenib. Also, an increased incidence of 
grade 5 events was observed in the sorafenib arms.  
An evaluation of the exposure-safety relationship including all subjects in study 14295 with available 
PK data using predicted AUC values from the PPK analysis was provided. No association between 
sorafenib exposure and frequency or severity of AEs were found. However, the analysis was limited 
since early exposure was related to the frequency of AEs at any time without taking into consideration 
dose adjustments or interruptions during treatment which may have distorted the relationship. 
Nevertheless, adverse events data presented per cycle showed that early AEs of grade >2 (e.g. HFS 
and hypertension) were handled by dose reductions as the frequency decreased over time and thereby 
indirectly showed a relationship between dose and AEs.

AEs leading to discontinuation of sorafenib were frequent, about 20% combining drug-related and 
disease-related events with a difference to placebo about 14%.  Adverse events leading to dose-
reduction in the placebo arm were of multiple categories, with no particular pattern, and most of them 
admittedly attributable to disease causes, easily comprised within the expectable errors of the 
imputation rules. Overall, 19% on sorafenib versus 4% on placebo discontinued therapy permanently 
due to AEs, the most common adverse event being hand-foot skin reactions, 5%. 37% of patients had 
dose interruption and 35% had dose reduction in cycle 1. 
Skin reactions led to dose interruptions in about 1 in 3 patients and altogether 2 out of 3 underwent 
dose interruptions for any cause to be compared with RCC patients where 10% had interruption of 
therapy.  
The incidence of ARs by MedDRA SOC and PT requiring a dose interruption in ≥ 2 patients reflects the 
overall AR pattern for sorafenib. Dose reductions were undertaken for typical side effects, but at a very 
high overall frequency, two thirds of the patients.  
The adverse reactions reported were in general well-known for sorafenib but seemed to occur at a 
clearly higher percentage of patients than in RCC (see table 32 from the pivotal RCC study). The 
frequencies of several known adverse reactions for sorafenib have been adequately updated in the 
product information. In the analysis of cumulative safety data (including study 14295), new adverse 
drug reactions were also reported with sorafenib: mucosal inflammation, dysgeusia, muscle spasm 
hyperkeratosis and flushing. These adverse reactions have been added to section 4.8 of the SmPC.   
With regard to the reports of deaths, reliable causality assessments were in most cases impossible as 
causes might be underlying disease, co-morbidities, study drug or an interaction between drug and 
medical conditions. However, more patients died as a TEAE in the sorafenib arm. This might at least 
partly be explained by a longer observation period. 
Cases of squamous cell carcinoma were reported in the pivotal study. Squamous cell carcinoma is 
mechanistically related to B-RAF inhibition. The incidence of keratoacanthoma/squamous cell cancer of 
the skin was clearly unbalanced with a much higher incidence in the sorafenib arm. Although it is 
acknowledged that patients with thyroid cancer are at increased risk to develop secondary neoplasia, 
keratoacanthoma or squamous cell cancer of the skin are usually not part of these. Keratoacanthoma 
and squamous cell cancer of the skin were usually late events but well within the life span of trial 
patients, and in some cases occurring early in the course of treatment (as early as 3 weeks after 
treatment onset). The frequency of keratoacanthoma/squamous cell cancer has been revised to 
‘common’ in the SmPC. No information is available on the pattern of genetic events in theses lesions 
was noticed.  
Hypocalcaemia grade 3 and 4 occurred in 6.8% and 3.4% of sorafenib-treated patients with 
differentiated thyroid cancer. The underlying causes of hypocalcaemia and secondary 
hyperparathyroidism have not been conclusively defined, but the reason for the observed increased 
risk in patients with thyroid cancer is highly likely to be related to thyroidectomy. Cases of Torsades de 
Pointes (TdP) have not been identified in the safety data base, but the number of patients with thyroid 
cancer is limited. Severe hypocalcaemia should be corrected to prevent complications such as QT-
prolongation or torsade de pointes (see section 4.4 of the SmPC). The RMP has been updated to list 
TdP as an important potential risk.   
TSH increase grade 1-2 was observed in about 1 in 3 patients treated with sorafenib, versus about 1 in 
8 placebo patients. Therefore, when using sorafenib in differentiated thyroid carcinoma patients, close 
monitoring of TSH level is recommended (see section 4.4 of the SmPC).

There was no safety data in patients with untreated tracheal, bronchial, and oesophageal infiltration. 
Due to the potential risk of bleeding, tracheal, bronchial, and oesophageal infiltration should be treated 
with localised therapy prior to administering sorafenib in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma 
(see section 4.4 of the SmPC). 
The MAH provided data on the prevalence and incidence of particular adverse reactions (rash, HFSR, 
diarrhoea, fatigue weight loss, TSH, hypocalcemia, hypertension) with grade by treatment cycle. Most 
adverse reactions occurred early and already during cycle 1 about 70% of patients underwent dose 
reduction/interruption. Percentage of patients with dose interruption decreased over time from close to 
40% to about 5%, whilst patients on reduced dose increased from about 1/3 to about 60% already at 
cycles 2 to 3; combining them, around 70% from cycle 1 to cycle 9. 
Some events, such as rash and perhaps hand-foot skin reactions appeared sensitive to dose reductions 
whilst this appeared not to be the case for diarrhoea and fatigue, for example. Data on the grade of 
rash, HFSR, diarrhoea and fatigue after first dose reduction or dose interruption followed by dose 
reduction showed similar patterns of AEs post dose reduction. Dose reduction was partially effective in 
reducing adverse events. 
The protocol of study 14295 provided recommendations for dose reductions/interruptions for 
haematological events, non-haematological events (except skin toxicity and hypertension), 
hypertension and skin toxicity. When dose reduction is necessary during the treatment of differentiated 
thyroid carcinoma, the dose should be reduced to 600 mg daily in divided doses (two tablets of 200 mg 
and one tablet of 200 mg twelve hours apart). If additional dose reduction is necessary, Nexavar may 
be reduced to 400 mg daily in divided doses of 200 mg twelve hours apart and if necessary further 
reduced to one tablet of 200 mg once daily. After improvement of non-haematological adverse 
reactions, the dose of Nexavar may be increased. This is adequately reflected in the SmPC. In order to 
assess whether a less toxic dose regimen can be implemented whilst maintaining efficacy in the DTC 
population, it is proposed that a time-to-event (TTE) analysis be performed using data from the phase 
III pivotal trial 14295. The MAH is recommended to submit the results once available. 
Adverse events by ECOG were presented. SAEs and grade 5 events were reported in patients with 
ECOG 1 (sorafenib and placebo arm). A subgroup analysis of AE by age was also presented. Numbers 
were very small, but it appeared that sorafenib was rather poorly tolerated in patients >75 years of 
age. Using a cut-off of 60, no meaningful differences were seen.   
2.5.3.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
For unknown reasons the exposure to sorafenib is increased in patients with DTC compared with RCC 
and HCC. This resulted in a higher frequency and severity of common adverse drug reactions.  
Most adverse reactions occurred early and already during cycle 1 about 70% of patients underwent 
dose reduction/interruption. Therefore, as recommended in the SmPC, there should be a repeat 
evaluation of the benefits and risks, taking into account the anti-tumour activity and tolerability of the 
treatment, and management of suspected adverse drug reactions may require temporary interruption 
or dose reduction of sorafenib therapy early in the treatment.  
2.5.4.  PSUR cycle

The annex II related to the PSUR refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged.

Section 4.4 Warnings and Precautions: 
Higher mortality has been reported in 
patients with squamous cell carcinoma of 
the lung treated with sorafenib in 
combination with platinum-based 
chemotherapies. In two randomised trials 
investigating patients with Non-Small Cell 
Lung Cancer in the subgroup of patients 
with squamous cell carcinoma treated with 
sorafenib as add-on to 
paclitaxel/carboplatin, the HR for overall 
survival was found to be 1.81 (95% CI 
1.19; 2.74) and as add-on to 
gemcitabine/cisplatin 1.22 (95% CI 0.82; 
1.80). No single cause of death dominated, 
but higher incidence of respiratory failure, 
hemorrhages and infectious adverse 
events were observed in patients treated 
with sorafenib as add-on to platinum-
based chemotherapies. 
Findings of inferior survival in squamous 
cell NSCLC patients from the ESCAPE trial 
have been included in Secion 4.4. of the 
SmPC. No additional labeling is considered 
to be required by Bayer at this time. 
The Nexavar® SmPC does not contain 
reference to unapproved indications. 
However the use in this indication is 
considered to be small, and potentially has 
fallen since the publication of the ESCAPE 
data. Bayer will continue to monitor off 
label use in lung cancer patients.

Text in SmPC 
Section 4.4 Warnings and Precautions: 
No formal studies of the effect of sorafenib 
on wound healing have been conducted. 
Temporary interruption of Nexavar therapy 
is recommended for precautionary reasons 
in patients undergoing major surgical 
procedures. There is limited clinical 
experience regarding the timing of 
reinitiation of therapy following major 
surgical intervention. Therefore, the 
decision to resume Nexavar® therapy 
following a major surgical intervention 
should be based on clinical judgement of 
adequate wound healing.

Section 4.4 Warnings and Precautions: 
QT interval prolongation  
Nexavar has been shown to prolong the 
QT/QTc interval (see section 5.1), which 
may lead to an increased risk for 
ventricular arrhythmias. Use sorafenib with 
caution in patients who have, or may 
develop prolongation of QTc, such as 
patients with a congenital long QT 
syndrome, patients treated with a high 
cumulative dose of anthracycline therapy, 
patients taking certain anti-arrhythmic 
medicines or other medicinal products that 
lead to QT prolongation, and those with 
electrolyte disturbances such as 
hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia, or 
hypomagnesaemia. When using Nexavar in 
these patients, periodic monitoring with 
on-treatment electrocardiograms and 
electrolytes (magnesium, potassium, 
calcium) should be considered.

Disease specific warnings: 
Hypocalcaemia in DTC 
When using sorafenib in patients with 
differentiated thyroid carcinoma, close 
monitoring of blood calcium level is 
recommended. In clinical trials, 
hypocalcaemia was more frequent and 
more severe in patients with differentiated 
thyroid carcinoma, especially with a history 
of hypoparathyroidism, compared to 
patients with renal cell or hepatocellular 
carcinoma. Hypocalcaemia grade 3 and 4 
occurred in 6.8% and 3.4% of sorafenib-
treated patients with differentiated thyroid 
cancer. (see section 4.8). Severe 
hypocalcaemia should be corrected to 
prevent complications such as QT-
prolongation or torsade de pointes (see 
section QT prolongation).   
QT prolongation is listed as a rare ADR in 
section 4.8 of the ADR. 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
In a clinical pharmacology study, QT/QTc 
measurements were recorded in 31 
patients at baseline (pre-treatment) and 
post-treatment. After one 28-day 
treatment cycle, at the time of maximum 
concentration of sorafenib, QTcB was 
prolonged by 4 ±19 msec and QTcF by 9 
±18 msec, as compared to placebo 
treatment at baseline. No subject showed 
a QTcB or QTcF >500 msec during the 
post-treatment ECG monitoring (see 
section 4.4). 
Pregnancy 
Text in SmPC 
None 
Section 4.6 Pregnancy and breast-feeding: 
Pregnancy 
There are no data on the use of sorafenib 
in pregnant women. Studies in animals 
have shown reproductive toxicity including 
malformations (see section 5.3). In rats, 
sorafenib and its metabolites were 
demonstrated to cross the placenta and 
sorafenib is anticipated to cause harmful 
effects on the foetus. Nexavar should not 
be used during pregnancy unless clearly 
necessary, after careful consideration of 
the needs of the mother and the risk to the 
foetus. 
Women of childbearing potential must use 
effective contraception during treatment. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether sorafenib is 
excreted in human milk. In animals, 
sorafenib and/or its metabolites were 
excreted in milk. Because sorafenib could 
harm infant growth and development (see 
section 5.3), women must not breastfeed 
during sorafenib treatment.

Section 4.4 Warnings and Precautions: 
Hepatic impairment 
No data is available on patients with Child 
Pugh C (severe) hepatic impairment. Since 
sorafenib is mainly eliminated via the 
hepatic route exposure might be increased 
in patients with severe hepatic impairment 
(see sections 4.2 and 5.2).

Hepatic impairment 
In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients 
with Child-Pugh A or B (mild to moderate) 
hepatic impairment, exposure values were 
comparable and within the range observed 
in patients without hepatic impairment. 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of sorafenib in 
Child-Pugh A and B non-HCC patients were 
similar to the PK in healthy volunteers. 
There are no data for patients with Child-
Pugh C (severe) hepatic impairment. 
Sorafenib is mainly eliminated via the liver, 
and exposure might be increased in this 
patient population. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information   
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 6.6 of the SmPC 
have been updated (see discussions on non-clinical aspects, clinical pharmacology, clinical efficacy and 
clinical safety).  
The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly.  
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template version 9.0. 
In addition the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of the local representatives in the package 
leaflet.

2.8.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The Package Leaflet submitted as part of the present application is based on the current Package 
Leaflet which has proven readability. Since the main issues of the package leaflet have already been 
tested, no new user testing was considered necessary. The changes made to the package leaflet to 
align with the SmPC are limited.  
However, since the last user testing for Nexavar had been conducted in 2005 the MAH plans to 
perform a new user testing within a year, which is also recommended by the CHMP. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Evidence of efficacy is provided by a randomised phase III trial that included a representative sample 
of patients and showed a clinically significant difference of five months in the primary objective 
progression free survival relatively to placebo. Median PFS time was 10.8 months in the sorafenib arm 
versus 5.8 months in the placebo arm (HR=0.587, 95%CI: 0.454; 0.758). PFS data appeared 
statistically robust (<0.0001). 
No important heterogeneities with respect to relative activity were observed from planned subgroup 
analysis, but as expected patients with a lower tumour burden, lung only metastases and papillary 
histology had a better prognosis. In an additional post-hoc analysis by maximum tumour size, patients 
with a maximum tumour size of less than 1.5 cm appeared to have less benefit with a HR of 0.87 
(95% CI: 0.40 - 1.89). In addition, the results for patients who were retrospectively categorized as 
symptomatic at baseline (median PFS sorafenib, 326 days; placebo, 109 days, HR [95%CI] 0.386 
[0.207; 0.720]) were numerically superior to the results in asymptomatic patients (median PFS 
sorafenib 329 days, placebo 220 days HR [95%CI] 0.602 [0.448; 0.807]).  
The independently reviewed confirmed ORR was about 12%. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Patients with likely symptomatic disease were only identified retrospectively as there was no 
systematic collection of data about the presence or absence of thyroid cancer related symptoms in the 
case report forms at baseline. Information about further progression at the time of enrolment in 
comparison to most recent progression was also not collected in study 14295. However, based on the 
available data, the CHMP considered that maximum lesion size, symptoms related to the disease and 
progression rate are important factors to be considered when evaluating the prognosis in the individual 
patient before initiating treatment (see section 4.4 of the SmPC).

Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The reported adverse events and serious adverse events in the pivotal and in the phase II studies were 
in general in line with adverse events described for the use of sorafenib in previously approved 
indications. However, a higher frequency and severity of common adverse drug reactions were 
identified. Particularly, hypocalcaemia was more frequent and more severe in patients with 
differentiated thyroid carcinoma, especially with a history of hypoparathyroidism, compared to patients 
with renal cell or hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, close monitoring of blood calcium level is 
recommended and severe hypocalcaemia should be corrected to prevent complications such as QT-
prolongation or torsade de pointes.  In addition, increases in TSH levels were observed in patients with 
DTC treated with sorafenib and close monitoring is also recommended. 
Most adverse reactions occurred early and already during cycle 1 about 70% of patients underwent 
dose reduction and or interruption. Dose reductions were partially successful in alleviating symptoms. 
Therefore, when to initiate therapy is a critical clinical decision point as well as if to continue therapy in 
case of disturbing side effects (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC).  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
There is no safety data in patients with untreated tracheal, bronchial, and oesophageal infiltration. Due 
to the potential risk of bleeding, tracheal, bronchial, and oesophageal infiltration should be treated with 
localised therapy prior to administering sorafenib (see section 4.4 of the SmPC). 
For unknown reasons, exposure to sorafenib is doubled in patients with thyroid cancer and this is likely 
to be the main cause of increased adverse reactions resulting in a stable, negative impact on HRQoL as 
estimated by FACT-G and EQ5D. The MAH is recommended to undertake further pharmacokinetic 
studies aiming at clarifying the grounds for the increased exposure from a mechanistic perspective.  
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
In the full study population a statistically convincing PFS benefit of about 5 months (HR: 0.587) has 
been shown and is considered clinically relevant.  
Baseline factors predictive of increased risk have not been identified, but it should be noticed that 
about half of the patients were ‘not at all’ or ‘only a bit bothered’ by side effects and that dose 
reductions were partly successful in alleviating symptoms. Due to the character of all frequent adverse 
drug reactions they are highly likely to be fully reversible after stopping therapy. Therefore, adverse 
reactions are expected to be managed through dose interruptions and dose reductions. Repeat 
evaluation of benefit and risk is also recommended taking anti-tumour activity and tolerability into 
account. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The benefit risk balance of Nexavar in the treatment of patients with progressive, locally advanced or 
metastatic, differentiated (papillary/follicular/Hürthle cell) thyroid carcinoma, refractory to radioactive 
iodine is considered positive.

Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
Based on the available safety and efficacy data, the CHMP recommended the approval of sorafenib for 
use in patient with progressive DTC refractory to radioactive iodine and considered that the prognosis 
in the individual patient should be carefully assessed considering maximum lesion size, symptoms 
related to the disease and progression rate. In addition, the CHMP considered that the risk of adverse 
reactions could be mitigated with appropriate evaluation and monitoring of the patient’s symptoms by 
the physician. Management of suspected adverse drug reactions may require temporary interruption or 
dose reduction of sorafenib therapy. 
The MAH is also recommended to further investigate a less toxic dose regimen/starting dose while 
preserving efficacy in the target population. 
4.  Recommendations 
Final Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
C.1.6 a) 
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
II 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one 
Extension of the indication for the treatment of progressive, locally advanced or metastatic, 
differentiated (papillary/follicular/Hürthle cell) thyroid carcinoma, refractory to radioactive iodine. The 
SmPC was revised in order to add warnings on the risk of bleeding, hypocalcaemia and TSH 
suppression as well as reflect relevant non-clinical and clinical safety and efficacy data in patients with 
differentiated thyroid carcinoma. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 6.6 of 
the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package 
Leaflet. 
Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the latest QRD template version 9.0.

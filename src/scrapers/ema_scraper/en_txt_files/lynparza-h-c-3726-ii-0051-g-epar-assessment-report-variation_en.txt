2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Breast cancer is the  most  common cancer in  the  world, with  an estimated  2.2  million  new  cases in  2020 
globally  (11.7%  of  all  new  cancers).  Breast cancer  is  also  the  fifth  most  common  cause  of  death  from 
cancer, with  an estimated  684,000  deaths  in  2020.  In  the  European Community  in  2020,  the  number  of 
cases of breast cancer in women and men was 355,457 and the number of deaths was 91,826 (ECIS 2020). 
Over 90% of patients with  breast cancer are diagnosed at  an early stage (Cardoso et al. 2018b).   
Nearly 30%  of women with  cancer confined to the  breast and 75%  of women with  nodal  involvement will 
ultimately  relapse  (Rosen  et  al  1989).  Metastatic  breast  cancer  remains  an  incurable  disease  with  an 
estimated 5-year OS of 25%  (Cardoso et al 2009). 
Breast cancer is  a  heterogeneous disease and optimal  treatment  depends on  pathological  and  molecular 
characterization of the tumour. Early-stage Breast cancer (Stages I to III) is defined as disease confined to 
the  breast  with  or  without  regional  lymph  node  involvement  and  in  the  absence of  metastatic  disease. 
Treatment for Stages I to III breast cancer usually includes surgery and radiation therapy, with the addition 
of chemotherapy for patients  with  high risk of recurrence, either before (neoadjuvant) or after (adjuvant) 
surgery. Other drug therapies including endocrine and anti-HER2  therapy are additionally given depending 
on ER and/or PgR and HER2 status.   
The  presence  of  micrometastases  or  clinically  occult  tumour  present  after  surgery  with  a  potential  to  
metastasize confer both morbidity and mortality. Pretreatment clinical stage (CS), estrogen receptor status 
(E),  histological  grade  (G),  and  post-treatment  pathologic  stage  (PS)  can  be  used  to  estimate  relapse 
probability  with  higher  risk  conferred  by  higher  CPS,  ER  negativity  and  Grade  3  (Jeruss  et  al  2008, 
Mittendorf  et al 2011). 
Claimed therapeutic indication 
The MAH applied for the  following indication:  
Olaparib  is  indicated  as  monotherapy  for  the  adjuvant  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  BRCA mutated, 
HER2-negative,  high  risk  early  breast  cancer  who  have  previously  been  treated  with  neoadjuvant  or 
adjuvant chemotherapy. 
The recommended indication is as follows: 
Lynparza is indicated as: 
• 
monotherapy or in combination with  endocrine therapy for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients 
with germline BRCA1/2-mutations who have HER2-negative, high risk early breast cancer previously treated 
with  neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy (see SmPC sections 4.1, 4.2 and 5.1). 
Assessment report  
EMA/651123/2022 
Page 10/138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Before  Lynparza  treatment  is  initiated  for  adjuvant  treatment  of  HER2  negative  high  risk  early  breast 
cancer, patients  must have confirmation of deleterious or suspected deleterious gBRCA1/2 mutation using 
a validated test  (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.1). 
Biologic features – BRCA Mutations in Breast Cancer 
In the general population, germline BRCA mutation carriers have an increased relative risk of breast cancer 
(Kuchenbaecker et  al  2017,  Antoniou  et  al  2003).  Onset  of  gBRCAm associated  breast  cancer  is  early 
(Mavaddat  et  al  2012),  as  also evidenced by  the  OlympiA and  the  OlympiAD trial  populations  where  the 
median  age  of  study  participants  at  the  time  of  randomisation  following  completion  of  neo/adjuvant 
treatment  in  OlympiA  was  42  years  (Tutt  et  al  2021)  and  at  the  time  of  randomisation  with 
advanced/metastatic disease in OlympiAD was 45 years (Robson et al 2017). 
BRCAm  breast  cancer  is  most  frequently  HER2  negative  (IHC  0,  1+  or  2+/FISH  non-amplified)  breast 
cancer, which can be either ER and/or PgR positive (ER and/or PgR IHC nuclear staining ≥1%) or TNBC (ER 
and/or PgR IHC  nuclear staining  <1%).  The development of HER2 positive BRCAm breast cancer, whilst  it 
does occur, is rare (Mavaddat et al 2012, Evans et al 2016, Winter et  al 2016). 
Approximately 3%  to  5%  of  patients  with  breast  cancer  carry  BRCA1/2  mutations  (Dorling  et  al  2021; 
Malone  et  al 2006).  Approximately 70%  of  BRCA1 mutation  carriers who develop breast cancers present 
with  TNBC; in contrast, breast cancer patients  carrying mutations in the  BRCA2 gene are more likely to be 
positive for expression of the  ER and/or PgR (Mavaddat et al 2012, Song et al 2020).  
BRCAm breast  cancer  is  associated  with  high-risk  features  with  a  poor  prognosis for  patients.  BRCA1/2 
breast cancer hallmarks include high histological grade, continuous pushing margins, TP-53 mutations, loss 
of RAD51  focus information,  extreme genomic instability  and sensitivity  to  DNA crosslinking  agents,  with 
BRCA1 tumours  additionally more frequently basal-like and ER-negative (Turner et al 2004).  TNBC, which 
is  more  frequently  associated  with  BRCA1m,  generally  has  a  poor  prognosis  despite  high  sensitivity  to 
chemotherapy  (Metzger-Filho  et  al  2012)  with  early  recurrence between  the  first  and  third  year  after 
diagnosis,  frequently  in  association  with  visceral and/or  brain  metastases and  a  shorter  period  between 
time  of  recurrence  and  death  (Dent  et  al  2007).  Germline  BRCA-associated hormone  receptor–positive 
breast cancer is also associated with intrinsically less favourable biology with more high- and intermediate-
risk disease and less low-risk disease compared to controls (Shah et al 2016). Within  BRCAm tumours, the 
proportions with high-risk features are very similar for each gene, regardless of the mutation being germline 
or  somatic  (Winter  et  al  2016).  When  compared to  BRCA wildtype  primary breast  carcinomas,  tumours 
harbouring  a  BRCA1/2  mutation  (gBRCA1 n=10,  gBRCA2 n=10,  sBRCA1  n=4,  sBRCA2  n=5),  showed  a 
higher proportion of  patients with  higher risk features including  N1-N3,  grade 3  tumours, ER/PR negative 
disease and basal subtype (Winter et al 2016). 
The development of metastatic  disease in BRCAm breast cancer is  also associated with  a poor prognosis. 
Song  et  al  2020  reported  that  breast  cancer  patients  with  a  BRCA1  mutation  frequently  experience 
metastasis to  lung  and distant  lymph nodes,  and BRCA2  mutation  carriers most  often  to  bone  and liver; 
the  data  also  indicate  that  at  least  one-half  of  patients  with  BRCA1-associated  or  BRCA2-associated 
metastatic breast cancer will develop CNS metastases. Involvement of CNS and other non-CNS distant sites 
(relative to locoregional recurrence or contralateral disease) as first recurrence events were associated with 
increased mortality risk.

Management 
The  decision  to  treat  patients  with  early  breast  cancer  with  neoadjuvant  or  adjuvant  chemotherapy  in 
addition to surgery/radiotherapy is driven by the consideration of clinical characteristics, tumour stage and 
pathology.  Randomised  clinical  trials  have found  no  significant  differences in  long-term  outcomes  when 
systemic chemotherapy is given before or after surgery (Mauri et al 2005,  Rastogi et al 2008). 
For TNBC, neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy has been the main systemic treatment option for patients. 
Chemotherapy treatment of patients with  early stage ER and/or PgR positive HER2  negative breast cancer 
depend  on  the  individual  risk  of  recurrence and  presumed  responsiveness to  endocrine therapy  (ESMO 
2019, NCCN Guidelines). For hormone receptor positive patients with ≥4 positive nodes at definitive surgery, 
NCCN guidelines recommend that all patients should receive adjuvant chemotherapy followed by endocrine 
therapy  (NCCN  Guidelines);  additional  chemotherapy  is  also  recommended  to  patients  with  hormone 
receptor positive cancers that  have high risk characteristics, such as high-grade tumour, large tumour size 
(≥2 cm), pathologically involved lymph nodes, and/or high recurrence score (OncotypeDX 21-gene or other 
multigene  assay). Adjuvant  endocrine therapy is  recommended following  neo/adjuvant chemotherapy for 
all ER and/or PgR positive HER2 negative patients  (NCCN Guidelines; ESMO 2019). 
Standard neo/adjuvant  chemotherapy for HER2  negative early disease is  an  anthracycline alkylator, and 
taxane-containing  regimen.  The  ESMO  Guidelines  (ESMO  2019)  recommend  that  a  sequential 
anthracycline/taxane-based  regimen  be  standard  for  the  majority  of  patients.  The  NCCN  and  ESMO 
guidelines consider there is  insufficient  evidence for the  routine use  of platinum  in  neoadjuvant regimens 
for TNBC patients. Whilst  platinum  compounds are not routinely recommended, the addition  of a platinum  
compound may be considered in high risk TNBC patients with deleterious BRCA1/2 mutations (ESMO 2019) 
and in selected patients where better local control is desirable (NCCN Guidelines). In high risk TNBC patients  
not  achieving  pCR  after  standard  neoadjuvant  chemotherapy,  the  addition  of  adjuvant  capecitabine 
postoperatively may be considered (NCCN Guidelines, ESMO 2019). 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Olaparib, is a potent oral human polyadenosine 5’diphosphoribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor that exploits 
deficiencies  in  DNA  repair  pathways  to  preferentially  target  cancer  cells  carrying  such  deficiencies. 
Dysfunctional  homologous recombination  repair  (HRR)  in  tumour  cells  results  in  reliance on  error prone 
repair pathways,  leading  to  an  accumulation  of DNA  damage and  cell  death  in  tumour  cells.  Lynparza is 
approved in EU  for the  treatment  of  ovarian cancer, breast  cancer, adenocarcinoma of the  pancreas and 
prostate cancer (see section 4.1 of the SmPC). 
The antitumour effects of the PARP inhibitor olaparib is dependent on an underlying defect in a cancer cell’s 
DNA damage response (DDR) mechanisms, rather than a direct interaction with a mutated gene or protein. 
These defects in DDR mechanisms arise from cells with  homologous recombination deficiencies (HRD),  of 
which BRCA mutations are one subtype. Olaparib traps PARP at the sites of single-strand DNA damage and 
prevents their repair (Murai  et  al 2012).  During  replication, the  single strand  breaks (SSBs) trapped  with 
PARP are converted to  double  strand  break (DSBs). These DSBs are normally repaired by  a  high-fidelity 
process known as HRR. BRCA mutated tumours with HRD cannot accurately repair the DNA damage, which 
may become lethal to  cells as it accumulates.  
Breast  cancers  harbouring  mutations  in  BRCA1  or  BRCA2  result  in  tumour  cells  lacking  BRCA  protein 
functionality  that  are  deficient  in  homologous  recombination,  making  BRCA  mutated  breast  cancer 
appropriate for treatment with  PARP inhibitors whereby the  process of synthetic lethality  can be exploited.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
This Type II variation is being grouped with  a consequential quality  Type IB variation (category B.I.z) 
reassessing the control strategy for potentially mutagenic impurities.  
In view of the proposed extension of the patient population  to an earlier line of cancer treatment (i.e., 
adjuvant setting), the  Applicant has reassessed the control strategy for potentially mutagenic impurities 
to consider a non ICH S9 patient population,  in line with  ICH M7 guidance. Consequently, the Applicant 
has submitted an updated Quality Overall Summary in Module 2.3 and updates in Module  3, S.3.2 
Impurities and S.4.5 Justification of Specification for Drug Substance.  
2.3.  Discussion on quality aspects 
The Applicant stated that  nothing has changed in  the quality of the olaparib active substance or Lynparza 
Tablets, and the way they are manufactured has not changed. The Applicant considers that there is no 
change to the drug substance specification required as the existing control strategy is appropriate for a 
non ICH S9 population.  
The recommended dose of olaparib tablets is 300 mg (two  150 mg tablets) taken twice daily, equivalent 
to a total daily dose of 600 mg per day. It is recommended that  treatment in the early breast cancer 
setting  be continued for a maximum of 12 months. The threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) limit  of 
10 μg/day has been proposed based on ICH M7,  applying a less than lifetime (LTL)  exposure where the 
expected duration of the use of the  product is less than 10  years. Based on this,  the permitted limit  for 
mutagenic impurity in olaparib drug substance would equate to 16.7  ppm using a staged TTC of 10 µg/d 
and a MDD of 600 mg.    
As a reminder, olaparib showed no mutagenic potential  in the Ames bacterial mutation tests  but was 
clastogenic in an in vitro chromosome aberration test. 
Following  review of the initially submitted  data, the control of potentially mutagenic impurities was not 
considered acceptable for the proposed additional indication. In addition,  the applicant was asked to 
revise the nitrosamine risk-assessment. The applicant submitted  satisfactory responses to the questions 
raised. 
At the time of the CHMP  opinion, a post-approval measure (PAM) was agreed with the  MAH and is put 
forward as recommendation: to provide the  results of a GLP Ames test for one impurity.  
Active substance  
A  Risk  Assessment  of  Potentially  Mutagenic  Impurities  (PMI)  has  been  provided  in  the  revised  section

Mutagenic  impurities  have  been  evaluated  using  a  (Q)SAR  analysis  employing  two  complementary 
methodologies  (DEREK),  a rule  based  expert system  (SAR), and  Leadscope  modeller, a  statistical  QSAR 
model,  Expert  evaluation of  SAR  predictions,  in  vivo/in  vitro  mutagenicity  testing.  This  evaluation takes 
into  account  all  the  starting  materials,  intermediates,  reagents,  as  well  as  potential  impurities  and 
degradation products of both the active substance and finished product. For each compound, it includes its 
chemical structure,  origin,  mutagenicity  risk assessment results,  Ames assessment when  applicable, and 
ICH M7  classification (class 1 to 5).  
Eight  compounds  were predicted to  be  mutagenic by  (Q)SAR analysis. Of those,  the  mutagenicity  of five 
compounds was confirmed. Impurities which are reported as known animal carcinogens were not assessed 
using the QSAR modeller but  have been treated as Class 1  in accordance with ICH M7.

The  classification  of  certain  impurities  as  class  5  compounds  was  not  acceptable  based  on  Amberg’s 
publication  only.  In  absence  of  relevant  additional  data,  the  Applicant  was  asked  to  categorize  these 
impurities as Class 3 compounds.  
The  risk of  one  impurity  being  present either  in  the  intermediate  or  in  the  final  active  substance can  be 
considered as unlikely since the conditions required to form this impurity are not employed. 
Two  of the  remaining structures  were ruled out  based on  negative results in  mutagenicity  tests  or based 
on structural analogy to  a compound which was non-mutagenic in an Ames test.      
One impurity  gives a positive prediction in  Derek Nexus and  it  is categorized as Class 5 compound based 
on a negative result in Ames test. However, some issues have been raised on this test and a GLP Ames test 
is requested in  order to  confirm the  negative results. Currently, the  impurity  is not  specifically named on 
the  olaparib  specification  but  is  controlled  as  “Any  individual  unspecified  impurity”.  The  current  control 
strategy for the impurity is acceptable provided that the negative results are confirmed (see conclusion).  
All the  other  impurities  were classified as  Class 5  compounds based on two  negative predictions  which  is 
sufficient  to  conclude  that  these  impurities  are of  no  mutagenic  concern according  to  ICH  M7.  Based on 
this,  no  further action  is  required for these impurities  that  include all  the  specified impurities of  the  drug 
substance and the potential degradation impurity of the  drug product    
Omission of test  for potentially mutagenic impurities has been justified in the revised section 3.2.S.4.5.  
One class 1 impurity is controlled via option 4, as described in ICH M7. The removal of this impurity through 
the  downstream processes was  demonstrated by  purging studies.  No  further  action  is required given  the 
effective purge.  
A further  class 1  impurity  is controlled via  option  3, as  described in  ICH  M7.  Levels of  this  impurity  have 
been reported as well below the specification limit,  no further action is required. 
One  class 3  impurity  is  controlled  via  option  4,  as  described in  ICH  M7,  in  order to  ensure  that olaparib 
meets  the  established toxicological  limit.  The predicted  purge  factor  of  this  class  3  impurity  through  the 
whole process has been determined.   Given a purge ratio well above 1000,  no specification is required for 
this mutagenic impurity  as per ICH M7 guidance. 
Further class 3 impurities are also controlled via option 4, as described in ICH M7.  
One  impurity  is  currently  controlled  under  “Unspecified  Impurity”.  The  predicted  purge  factor  of  this 
impurity  through  the  whole  process  has  been  determined.  Given  a  purge  ratio  well  above  1000,  no 
specification is required as per ICH M7 guidance.   
One  impurity  is  currently  specified  with  a  limit,  while  two  related impurities  are controlled  as  any  other 
impurity.  Based on  this,  and  considering their  purge  through  the  whole  process, these impurities  can  be 
controlled via option 4,  as described in ICH M7. 
Finished product  
Given the proposed extension of the patient population to an earlier line of cancer treatment (i.e. adjuvant 
setting),  the  control  strategy  for  potential  nitrosamines  in  the  drug  product  has  been  reassessed.  No 
significant risk of presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been identified. 
2.4.  Conclusion on quality aspects 
Based on the review of the data on quality, the CHMP  considers that  the control strategy for potential 
mutagenic impurities is acceptable for the proposed (adjuvant) indication. The data provided sufficiently

support the proposed changes. Relevant sections of Module  3 have been updated accordingly. The MAH  is 
recommended to provide the results of a GLP Ames test  for one impurity (see also non-clinical aspects).

The  Applicant  has  submitted  an  updated  Nonclinical  Overview. The  nonclinical  package  of  studies  was 
reviewed in  accordance with  the ICH  M3(R2)  guidance and an abbreviated package was proposed in  view 
of the high-risk nature of the intended patient  population i.e. BRCAm HER2-negative high risk early breast 
cancer. No  additional nonclinical studies  to further investigate carcinogenicity, reproductive toxicity  or the  
safety of metabolites were submitted  (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).

2.5.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
With this application, Lynparza is proposed to be indicated in early breast cancer that falls under ICH M3(R2) 
for non-advanced cancers.  
No additional non-clinical studies were submitted in support of this application. The non-clinical and clinical 
risks are considered to  be well characterised and the adverse effects in animals are sufficiently known.  
Olaparib is not mutagenic but causes clastogenicity consistent with  the mechanism of action. The potential 
for genotoxicity in  humans  is mentioned  in  section 5.3  of the  SmPC and  a subsection on  myelodysplastic 
syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia (MDS/AML) is included in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. New primary 
malignancies (NPM)  and  MDS/AML  are also described as important  potential  risk and  important identified 
risk,  respectively,  in  the  olaparib  risk  management  plan  (RMP).  Since  2014,  these  risks  have  been 
proactively  monitored  during  clinical  development,  which  included  solicited  reporting  of  adverse events 
(AEs) during the overall survival follow-up phase in the majority of MAH-sponsored clinical trials. 
Olaparib has shown  embryo-foetal toxicity  and teratogenicity.  The product information  includes adequate 
warnings in  relation  to pregnancy and contraception.  The duration  of contraception use following  the  end 
of  treatment  for  women  of  childbearing  potential was  revised in  line  with  the  document  ‘Response from 
SWP  to  CMDh  questions  regarding  genotoxicity  and  contraception’  (EMA/CHMP/SWP/74077/2020). 
Lynparza should  not  be used  during  pregnancy and  in  women of  childbearing potential  not  using  reliable 
contraception during  therapy and  for 6 months  after receiving the  last dose of Lynparza (see sections 4.4 
and 4.6).  Breastfeeding during treatment  and for 1  month  after the  last dose is a  contraindication due to  
the pharmacological properties of the product (see SmPC section 4.3). 
M18  (a product  of phase 1 metabolic pathways)  was identified as the  only major circulating metabolite  in 
humans (15.8%  of total  drug-related exposure). This metabolite was also found in  humans. Because M18 
was less potent  than olaparib in primary pharmacology and structurally similar to olaparib, additional risks 
are considered unlikely. 
A complete and acceptable environmental risk assessment was submitted for Lynparza. Olaparib was 
found to be very persistent in the environment (DT50 >  180 days). Olaparib did not demonstrate any 
other environmental risks. The conclusions of this  updated ERA are consistent with  that of the previously 
submitted  ERA. The patient use of Lynparza is not predicted to present a risk to the environment. 
An Ames study provided for one of the impurities (see quality aspects) did not show any mutagenic potential 
of the impurity up to a concentration of 500 µg/well  without  S9 and up to  1600 µg/well  with S9. However, 
the  study  provided was not  GLP  compliant  and the  MAH  is recommended to  provide the  results  of a  GLP 
Ames test  for the impurity.  It is recommended that the maximum doses with  and without  S9 are selected 
as  the  highest  doses  where  a  precipitate  is  observed  without  interfering  with  scoring.  Triple  plating  is 
recommended at each dose level and the  use of the preincubation method is encouraged.

2.5.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in  this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP.  The risks associated with olaparib have been characterised based on available non-clinical and 
clinical data and are adequately described in the Lynparza EU SmPC and addressed in the EU Risk 
Management Plan (RMP). 
The updated data submitted in this  application do not lead to  a significant  increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of olaparib. Considering the above data, olaparib is not  expected to pose a 
risk to  the environment.

(n=69). Source: Olaparib-MS-09 
Effect of intrinsic Factors on the PK of Olaparib 
The updated pop-PK analysis (Olaparib-MS-09) did not identify gender, race, tumour  location, age or body 
weight  as significant covariates. Additionally, BRCA1/2 status was not identified as a significant covariate. 
Effect of Extrinsic Factors on the  PK of Olaparib 
Considering that  the claimed indication implies co-administration of olaparib and anti-hormonal drugs such 
as tamoxifen, and letrozole and anastrozole, the potential for DDI interaction of olaparib and antihormonal 
drugs  was  investigated.  Study  D081CC00001  was  conducted  to  evaluate the  DDI between  olaparib  and 
anti-hormonal agents at steady state, such as anastrozole (1  mg od), letrozole (2.5  mg od) and tamoxifen 
(20 mg od). It was an open label, non-randomised, parallel group, multicentre, Phase I study to assess the 
safety and the effect of olaparib at steady state on the PK of the anti-hormonal agents anastrozole, letrozole 
and  tamoxifen  at  steady  state,  and  the  effect  of  the  anti-hormonal  agents  on  olaparib,  following 
administration in patients  with  advanced solid cancer. Part A of the study (mandatory) assessed the effect 
of  olaparib on  the  PK parameters of  anastrozole, letrozole and  tamoxifen and  vice versa; Part B  allowed 
patients (if eligible) continued  access to olaparib after the  PK phase and provided additional safety data. 
The main findings of Study D081CC00001are summarised below.

When  olaparib (300  mg  tablet)  was co-administered with  tamoxifen (20  mg od),  there was a  decrease in 
olaparib Geometric least squares (GLS) mean AUCss of 27% (mean ratio: 0.73; 90% CI: 0.63, 0.84), and 
a decrease in steady state GLS mean Cmaxby 20% (mean ratio: 0.80; 90%  CI: 0.71,  0.90).

Effects of Other  anti-hormonal Drugs (anastrozole and letrozole) on the  PK of Olaparib 
The anti-hormonal drugs, anastrozole (1 mg od) and  letrozole (2.5  mg od) had no  relevant impact on the  
steady state  exposure to  olaparib  (300  mg  bd)  when  given  in  combination.  The  mean ratio  (90%CI)  for 
olaparib  AUCss  and  Cmax,ss  were  0.89,  (0.76-1.05)  and  0.94(0.84-1.04)  when  co-administered  with 
anastrozole; and the GLS mean ratio for olaparib AUCssand Cmax,sswere 1.15 (1.07-1.25)  and 1.09 (0.99-
1.21)  for Cmax,ss when co-administered with  letrozole. 
Effects of Olaparib  on the  PK of Other anti-hormonal  Drugs (anastrozole and letrozole) 
Olaparib had no marked effect on the  exposure to anastrozole or letrozole at  steady state. The GLS mean 
ratio (90%CI) on anastrozole AUCss and Cmax,ss were 0.86, (0.80-0.93)  and 0.90  (0.84-0.97) 
respectively; and the  mean ratio on letrozole AUCss and Cmax,ss were 0.95 (0.91-0.99)  and 0.94 
(0.914-0.98)  for Cmax,ss respectively.

PK/PD modelling /Exposure-Response relationshipExposure-Efficacy Relationship 
In OlympiA, Kaplan-Meier curves for IDFS stratified by the tertile exposure for any of the exposure metrics 
showed no apparent exposure-response trend. In addition, Cox proportional hazard analysis based on AUCss 
values spanning over the range of 13.2  μg.h/mL  to 101 μg.h/mL  could not  detect a statistically significant 
correlation  between  this  exposure metric  and  IDFS.  In  patients  with  PK  data  who  received concomitant 
tamoxifen and were demonstrated to  have lower exposure of olaparib, the  Kaplan-Meier curve was similar 
to that  of patients with  PK data who did not  receive concomitant tamoxifen (Figure 2). 
Figure 2: Kaplan  Meier  Curves for patients with PK data  on concomittant tamoxifen   (n =8) and  
for patients with PK data  not on concomittant (n=61) in OlympiA  
Similarly, graphical analyses in OlympiAD did not reveal any apparent relationship in breast cancer patients 
between olaparib exposure metrics and PFS, OS, or PFS2.   
Exposure-Safety  Relationship 
The most recent exposure-safety analysis based on pooled data from monotherapy studies with the tablet 
formulation  (Olaparib-MS-09) suggested  daily Cmax and daily AUC behaved similarly as the  best predictor 
for  safety  endpoints.  Similar  to  the  previous  analyses,  it  identified  relatively  weak  exposure‑response 
relationships between  at  least  one of the  exposure metrics of  olaparib and anaemia, decreased appetite, 
fatigue,  nausea,  vomiting,  and  diarrhoea.  Anaemia  had  a  statistically  significant  relationship  with  all 
exposure metrics while there  was no increased dysgeusia, headache and neutropenia event rate detected 
for any for the exposure metrics.

2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The tablet formulation was used in  study OlympiA. The proposed recommended total dose of olaparib in 
the indication  under review is 600  mg per day. The drug is recommended to be administered as two 
150 mg tablets  (300 mg) taken twice daily. The 100  mg strength could be used for dose reduction when 
needed.  
No complementary formal PK investigations were provided in the  context of the  variation under review. 
However, the  already assessed pop-PK model was updated by the  inclusion of data from study OlympiA. 
The PKs of olaparib in the  target patients was assessed and compared to the PK profile characterised in 
other cancer patients. Also, based on the updated model, the exposure-response (Efficacy and safety) 
relationship in target patients was investigated.  
Exposure to  olaparib in the  OlympiA study, collected from breast cancer patients, was shown to be similar 
to that  observed in previous studies with the  olaparib 300mg bd tablet.   
The potential for DDI for olaparib as a victim or perpetrator has been previously investigated and 
characterized. The results of study D081CC00001  (effect of anti-hormonal agents on olaparib) were 
previously submitted in procedure EMEA/H/C/003726/X/0016/G  supporting the use of the  tablet 
formulation. Based on this study, it  was concluded that  no significant interaction was observed with 
anastrozole or letrozole whereas tamoxifen decreased exposure to olaparib by 27%. However, results 
from PK/PD modelling suggested that  the exposure response for efficacy in breast cancer was flat at  the 
300 mg bd dose level. Therefore, the reduction in olaparib exposure due to co-administration of 
tamoxifen is not  considered clinically relevant. Section 4.5  of the  SmPC has been updated accordingly. 
The potential for DDI of olaparib with  exemestane and goserelin has not been investigated. Nevertheless, 
the potential  for relevant PK-based DDI between olaparib and exemestane or goserelin is unlikely given 
the different metabolic pathways, the  clinical data available and the PBPK predictions.   
The Exposure-Response (efficacy-safety) relationship was investigated in the proposed target population 
included in study OlympiA. The outcome of this analysis is consistent with  that  described for patients  in 
other indications. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
No  significant  difference in  PKs characteristics was  observed in  breast cancer patients  from the  OlympiA 
study  compared to  the  PK  profile of olaparib tablet  formulation observed in previous studies  in  approved 
indications.

haematological disorder which predisposes the patient to develop a haematological malignancy. Exception: 
lymphoma (refer to  Exclusion Criterion 7). 
14. Major surgery within  2 weeks prior to randomisation: patients must have recovered from any effects of 
any major surgery. 
CPS&ES score 
In the OlympiA study, non-pCR combined with  CPS&EG score ≥ 3  was implemented within  the eligibility 
criteria to  select “high risk” ER and/or PgR positive, HER2  negative gBRCAm patients following 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy whose risk of recurrence would be expected to  be comparable to that  of a 
TNBC non-pCR population.  
In clinical practice, there is no universal system/tool on how to define a ‘high-risk’ patient for subgroups 
of early breast cancer, and definition  of high-risk breast cancer may be based on local/regional clinical 
guidelines (Cardoso et al 2019, NCCN  Guidelines 2021).  However, non-pCR post neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy, high tumour burden, nodal involvement, aggressive biology and young age are among the 
common ‘high-risk’ factors (Cardoso et al 2019, NCCN  Guidelines 2021).  To illustrate the correlation 
between the CPS&EG scoring system and the conventional high-risk criteria, Table 5 shows how AJCC 
(TNM)  staging, oestrogen receptor status and tumour nuclear grade were utilized  to assign points  to the 
CPS&EG scoring system. With  higher pre-treatment clinical staging (per AJCC criteria) and post-treatment 
pathological staging (per AJCC criteria), more points were assigned. In addition, points  were given to 
well-recognized high-risk factors, such as ER negativity and tumour nuclear grade 3  based on the 
CPS&EG scoring system.

BRCA Testing Methodologies 
Data on gBRCA mutation status  for OlympiA was to be obtained from a combination of locally generated 
BRCA mutation  status obtained from medical records and reported in the CRFs, and/or assessment at a 
central laboratory, Myriad Genetic Laboratories Inc. BRCA testing  of all patients  in China was to  be 
conducted locally by BGI Laboratory. 
Germline BRCA testing  conducted for OlympiA by Myriad was performed either using their CLIA-based 
assay, BRACAnalysis, or BRACAnalysis CDx.  
Local testing laboratories could use a variety of methods to detect BRCA variants. Locally identified  BRCA 
mutations  were to be taken from medical records and reported within  the CRF,  however details of the 
specific methods used to detect the variants were not  required to be provided. Confirmatory testing of 
locally reported mutations was to be subsequently performed by central testing  at Myriad. 
Treatments 
Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either olaparib tablets 300 mg bd or the matching placebo 
tablets orally bd for up to a maximum of 12 months.   
The 100 mg olaparib tablets  were used to manage dose reductions. 
Patients were allowed to have concurrent treatment with  endocrine therapy as per local guidelines.

events 
-  HRQoL/PROs:  FACIT-Fatigue  symptom  scale  score  and  EORTC-QLQ-C30  global  health  status, 
functional, and symptoms scales/items scores

-  Adjusted overall survival estimates (if applicable) 
Sample size 
A total of 1800 patients  were to be randomised into  the study to achieve 330 IDFS events. If the true HR 
for the comparison of olaparib versus placebo in terms of IDFS was 0.7 then  with 330  events, the  analysis 
of IDFS will  have 90% power to demonstrate a statistically  significant difference in IDFS, assuming a 2-
sided 5% significance level. The critical HR value at the primary analysis at 330  events was 0.805. 
During the study, the Steering Committee was to monitor the recruited patient  population and actual 
event rate whilst  remaining blinded to treatment. If the data suggested that the original sample size 
assumptions were incorrect such that achieving the required number of events with  the current number 
of patients did not seem feasible, then in consultation  with  the IDMC a decision could be made to increase 
the number of patients recruited into  the study to achieve the required 330 events.  
Sample Size Consideration for PRO Endpoints 
It  was  assumed that  half of  triple  negative  patients  and  a quarter  of hormone  receptor positive  patients 
would have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and it was anticipated that  95% of patients enrolled in the 
study would complete the HRQoL instrument. In addition, adjusting  downward to  allow for 20% of missing 
Assessment report

data at the 12 months assessment point, it was expected that data from 633 neoadjuvant and 735 adjuvant 
patients  would  be  available (assuming that  15%  of  the  total  1800  enrolled patients  were ER  and/or PgR 
positive,  HER2  negative).  These  would  be  sufficient  to  provide  statistical  power  of  93%  and  96% 
correspondingly to detect a difference of 3 points on the FACIT-Fatigue scale score between treatment arms 
assuming a SD of 10.9  (Cella et al 2002b;  estimated SD of mean baseline score) and controlling α-level at 
0.05.  No  multiple  comparisons adjustment  was  employed since these outcomes evaluated the  toxicity  of 
the study treatment. A collection of PROs and QoL from all patients enrolled in the main study was expected 
to provide sufficient statistical  power to detect important differences between the 2 treatment arms. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomised in a 1:1  ratio to either olaparib or placebo for up to  a maximum of 12  months.  
Randomisation used permuted blocks and was stratified by:  
- 
- 
- 
hormone receptor status  (ER and/or PgR positive/HER2 negative vs TNBC),  
prior neoadjuvant vs adjuvant chemotherapy,  
prior platinum  use for breast cancer (yes vs no). 
Blinding (masking) 
OlympiA was a double-blind study.  
Statistical methods 
A  superiority interim  analysis of  IDFS  was  protocolled to  occur when  half  of  the  events required  for  the 
primary IDFS analysis (165 events) had been observed from the first 50% of patients  recruited (i.e., from 
the first 900 patients).  The IDFS interim analysis was to be performed on all 1836 recruited patients, whilst 
additionally providing a cohort of 900 patients with a similar level of maturity to that planned for the primary 
IDFS analysis.  
Statistical methods 
IDFS (Time from randomisation to  invasive disease recurrence or death due to any cause):  
- 
Primary analysis stratified log-rank test  and Cox regression 
-  Key supportive  analysis:  stratified  Cox  regression in  randomised  patients  confirmed  as  gBRCAm 
positive by central Myriad test (if different from FAS [ITT]) 
DDFS (Time from randomisation to distant  recurrence or death due to any cause): 
-  Stratified log-rank test  and Cox regression 
-  Key supportive  analysis:  stratified  Cox  regression in  randomised  patients  confirmed  as  gBRCAm 
positive by central Myriad test (if different from FAS [ITT]) 
OS (Time from randomisation to  death due to any cause):  
-  Stratified log-rank test  and Cox regression 
-  Key supportive  analysis:  stratified  Cox  regression in  randomised  patients  confirmed  as  gBRCAm 
positive by central Myriad test (if different from FAS [ITT])

EORTC QLQ-C30 GI symptoms and EORTC QLQ-C30 HRQoL: mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) 
For  the  primary  analysis,  invasive disease  free  survival, p-values  were  calculated  using  a  log-rank  test 
stratified  by  the  stratification  factors  determined  by  the  pooling  strategy.  The  hazard  ratio  (HR)  was 
estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model with  the same stratification factors as the log-rank test. 
The 2-sided  95%  CIs were calculated using  the profile likelihood approach. IDFS times  were summarised 
using  Kaplan-Meier  (KM)  survival  curves  and  the  percentages  of  surviving  subjects  who  were  invasive 
disease free at  1 year, 2 years, and 3  years from the  time of randomisation  were estimated  from the  KM 
curves.  Approximate  95%  confidence  limits  were  calculated,  based  on  Greenwood’s  formula  for  the 
standard error of the  KM estimate.  
Four IDFS sensitivity analyses were performed to  assess the robustness of the  primary analysis: including 
only  patients  with  central  pathology  review  data  for  hormone  receptor  status  (ER  and  PgR),  using 
unadjusted analysis, using interval censoring, and using the restricted mean survival time (RMST) method. 
Exploratory  subgroup  analyses  of  IDFS  in  the  full  analysis  set  (FAS)  were  conducted  to  assess  the 
consistency  of  treatment  effect  across  potential  or  expected  prognostic  factors,  including  the  baseline 
stratification factors. 
A multiple  testing  procedure was employed across the  IDFS, DDFS, and  OS endpoints  to strongly  control 
the overall type I error at 5% 2-sided, accounting for any interim analyses on IDFS, DDFS and OS and also 
planned further analyses post the  primary IDFS Data Cut Off (DCO). 
A hierarchical testing strategy was employed where IDFS was tested first using the full test mass (i.e., full 
5%, 2-sided alpha), then  DDFS and OS were tested if IDFS was significant based on a weighted proportion 
of the test mass (4% for DDFS and 1% for OS, 2-sided) which was recycled to secondary endpoints not yet 
rejected. Testing stopped when the entire test  mass was allocated to non-rejected endpoints (Figure 4). 
Figure 4  OlympiA: Multiple  testing procedure 
Invasive disease free survival was planned to be analysed at the interim (165 IDFS events in the first 900 
patients) and the primary (330 IDFS events) IDFS analysis. If IDFS was statistically significant at the interim 
based on  the  ITT  population  then  secondary endpoints  were formally tested  at  the  interim  based  on  the

MTP outlined above. To account for multiple analyses on each endpoint a separate alpha spending function 
was applied to each endpoint (Glimm et al 2010). It was anticipated that  further analyses of DDFS and OS 
with  more  mature  follow-up  may  have  been  required  for  which  some  alpha  would  be  reserved  for 
significance testing.   
Study populations  
- 
Full  analysis set (FAS) 
o 
Intention-to-treat  (ITT): This included all randomised patients and compared the treatment 
arms on the  basis of randomised treatment, regardless of the treatment actually received. 
Note:  it  was  anticipated  that  all  patients  would  be randomised by the  time  of  the  interim 
analysis. 
o  Mature  cohort  ITT  population:  This  included  the  first  900  randomised patients  only  and 
compared  the  treatment  arms  on  the  basis  of  randomised treatment,  regardless of  the 
treatment  actually  received.  This  analysis  was  to  be  regarded  as  supportive,  to  aid 
interpretation  of  the  result  in  the  ITT  population  based  on  interim  data.  Statistical 
significance was not  required for the  mature cohort population. 
The  primary  analysis  population  was  all  patients  randomised  (ITT).  A  subgroup  analysis 
(supportive) based on prior chemotherapy (adjuvant or neoadjuvant), prior platinum  therapy (yes 
or  no)  and  hormone receptor  status  (ER  and/or  PgR  positive,  HER2  negative versus  TNBC)  was 
conducted to check for consistency in the  treatment effect. 
-  Safety  Analysis  Set  (SAS):  All  patients  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  randomised  study 
treatment,  olaparib or placebo, were to  be included  in  the SAS. If a  patient  received at  least one 
dose of  olaparib he/she  was  included in  the  olaparib arm for  safety summaries (ie,  olaparib arm 
included  patients  randomised  to  olaparib  who  received at  least  one  dose  of  olaparib or  placebo 
patients  who  received at least  one dose of olaparib in error at any time).  If a  patient  randomised 
to  olaparib received only placebo treatment,  then  he/she was  summarised as  part of  the placebo 
arm. 
- 
PK Analysis Set: Approximately 150 patients randomised to olaparib/placebo will have provided PK 
samples at those sites that had confirmed that they were able to collect the PK assessment samples. 
Placebo samples were not  analysed unless specified. Pharmacokinetic sampling  was performed in 
a subset of patients who had signed the optional PK informed consent.  Pharmacokinetic data were 
analysed according to  treatment received. This population  comprised those that  were randomised 
to olaparib who received at least one dose of study treatment, had at least one PK sample collected, 
and  did  not  violate  or  deviate  from  the  Clinical  Study  Protocol  (CSP)  in  ways  that  would  have 
significantly affected the  PK analyses. 
- 
PRO  Analysis  Set:  This  population  comprised  patients  who  consented  to  participate  in  the  PRO 
assessment  portion  of  the  study,  who  started  treatment  and  who  provided  evaluable  baseline 
FACIT-Fatigue or EORTC QLQ-C30 data, where evaluable means that at least one sub-scale baseline 
score was determined.  Baseline was  defined as  the  last  result on  or before the  first  day of  study 
drug. For  patients  who were randomised but  not  treated, baseline was not  derived and they were 
to  be  excluded  from  the  PRO  analysis  set.  Since  the  PRO  analysis  set  included  those  with  an 
evaluable baseline score for either the FACIT-Fatigue or the EORTC QLQ-C30, the analyses for each 
questionnaire were based on  a subset of  the PRO analysis set  with  an  evaluable baseline for  that 
questionnaire. The PRO analysis was to be summarised by planned treatment arm.

Patient reported outcomes 
Hypotheses 
The hypotheses and measurement strategy focused on the fact that patients in the study would be starting 
with significant decrements in HRQoL and high rates of symptoms at study entry (baseline) due to previous 
chemotherapy and  local treatments  (surgery with  or without  radiation therapy).  Therefore, the  following 
hypotheses were proposed based on the expected toxicities of olaparib. 
Primary PRO Hypothesis 
Patients receiving olaparib may experience greater fatigue severity during treatment than those  receiving 
placebo as measured by the FACIT-Fatigue  scale at 6 and 12 months  after randomisation. 
No  multiple  comparisons adjustments  were to  be employed since these outcomes evaluate the toxicity  of 
the study treatment. 
Secondary PRO Hypotheses 
• 
• 
• 
Patients receiving olaparib may experience greater GI symptoms (nausea/vomiting, diarrhoea, and 
pain) severity during treatment than those receiving placebo as measured at 6 and 12 months after 
randomisation but no difference expected by 24 months after randomisation. 
There will  be  no  difference in  fatigue  post-discontinuation  of  study  treatment  as  measured at  18 
and 24 months. 
There  will  be  no  difference in  QoL  between  the  two  treatment  arms  as  measured by  the  global 
health status/QoL score and other functional sub-scales from the EORTC QLQ-C30 at 6, 12, 18, and 
24  months  after  randomisation  and  patients  will  demonstrate  improvements in  functioning  over 
time. 
All secondary analyses were considered exploratory and therefore no adjustments for multiplicity  were 
to be made.  
The FACIT-Fatigue and EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaires were completed at baseline (prior to randomisation) 
and every 6 months  for a period of 2 years.

Results 
Participant flow 
Germline BRCA testing results in OlympiA and routes to randomisation 
In total, 14387  patients were screened for entry into OlympiA. This includes 203  patients with  unknown 
gBRCA status (due to  no sample available for testing  and no pre-existing local gBRCA result), resulting in 
14184  patients with  pre-existing available local gBRCA result or a blood sample available for testing. Of 
these patients, 1114  patients had a pre-existing gBRCA result from local testing,  2515  patients were 
screened prospectively in China using  the BGI test, 10554  patients were screened prospectively using the 
Myriad CLIA or CDx gBRCA test and 1 patient  was prospectively tested at  Myriad under the SOLO3 study. 
Within  patients meeting the OlympiA study eligibility criteria, 1114 patients  were randomised based on an 
existing local gBRCA result, 474 based on a Myriad gBRCA CLIA or CDx result, 247 based on a gBRCA 
result from BGI testing in China and the remaining patient was prospectively tested at Myriad under the 
SOLO3 study (no result was reported under OlympiA study ID). In total,  1836 patients  were randomised 
onto the OlympiA study. 
Participant flow 
A  total  of  1836  patients  with  breast  cancer and  gBRCA1/2  mutations  were  randomised to  receive either 
olaparib 300 mg bd (n=921) or placebo (n=915). At the DCO date (27 March 2020), 1353 patients (73.7%) 
had completed study treatment  per CSP and 39  patients (2.1%)  were still receiving study treatment. 
Of  1836  patients  randomized, 21  patients  did  not  receive their  planned  study  medication  (10  patients  in 
the olaparib arm, 11 patients  in the placebo arm).  
A higher proportion of olaparib-treated patients than placebo-treated patients discontinued study treatment 
due to  AEs  (97  patients  [10.5%]  versus 41 patients  [4.5%])  and patient  decision  to stop  study  drug  (60 
patients [6.5%]  versus 32  patients [3.5%]).  A lower proportion of olaparib-treated patients  than placebo-
treated  patients  discontinued  study  treatment  due  to  recurrence of  disease  (40  patients  [4.3%]  versus 
80 patients  [8.7%]).  
The majority of patients (73.7%) completed 12 months of treatment per protocol, with a similar proportion 
of  patients  in  each treatment  arm: 19  patients  and  20  patients  are still  ongoing  study  treatment  at  data 
cut-off in olaparib and placebo arm respectively.

Conduct of the study 
Premature unblinding 
A total of 133 participants were prematurely unblinded as follows (DCO):  
- 
olaparib arm: n=45 patients  [4.9%]. One patient was unblinded prior to the investigator-assessed 
IDFS event and 36  patients were unblinded on or after an IDFS event. Eight  patients  did not  have 
an IDFS event; all of which were unblinded  after discontinuation  of randomised study treatment. 
- 
placebo arm:  n=88  patients  [9.6%].  Two  patients  were unblinded  prior  to  investigator-assessed 
IDFS event and 82  patients were unblinded  on or after an IDFS event. Four  patients did  not  have 
an IDFS event; all of which were unblinded  after discontinuation  of randomised study treatment. 
Protocol deviations 
The number of patients with  important  protocol deviations and important GCP violations in each 
treatment arm and overall is summarised in  Table 6.

Baseline data 
The demographic and key baseline characteristics of FAS and Myriad gBRCAm patients  are summarised in 
Table 8.   
The  Myriad gBRCAm patient  population  excluded patients  with  only a  local or  Breast International Group 
(BIG)  result.  Out  of  1836  patients  enrolled  into  OlympiA,  1623  were  confirmed  as  gBRCAm by  central 
testing,  either prospectively (n=474)  or retrospectively (n=1149, based on local or BIG result).

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary variable 
Primary endpoint: IDFS by investigator assessment (FAS, DCO 27  March 2020, 15.5%  maturity) 
As the  pre-defined statistical  threshold  for superiority of olaparib versus placebo for IDFS was met  at  the 
interim analysis (2-sided, 0.005 significance level), the superiority interim analysis reported constitutes the  
primary IDFS analysis for this  study.  
Median duration of follow-up was 2.3 years in the olaparib arm and 2.5 years in the placebo arm. The IDFS 
status based on investigator assessment at  the time of the DCO is presented in Table 16.

Cancers Occurring Post Randomisation 
Table 20 presents all cancers occurring post randomisation (COPRs), which  included not  only the incidence 
of  cancers of  special interest  as listed  in  the  secondary efficacy  endpoint,  but  also  the  incidence  of  new 
primary non-breast, non-ovarian cancers including MDS/AML. 
New  primary malignancies (NPM)  are those  that  are not  the  primary reason for the  administration  of  the 
study treatment  and have developed after the  inclusion of the  patient  into the  study. Invasive non-breast 
new  primary  cancers  were  confirmed  by  clinical  or  radiological  examination,  with  positive  histology  or 
cytology  when  the  lesion  was  easily  accessible for  biopsy.  These events  were captured  in  eCRF  on  the 
“Second Primary Malignancy” form.  
In  comparison,  breast  cancer  relapses  in  the  OlympiA  study  includes  ipsilateral  invasive breast  tumour 
recurrence, regional invasive breast cancer recurrence, distant recurrence, and contralateral invasive breast

cancer if determined as recurrence by the investigator. Locoregional recurrence of the disease (ipsilateral, 
regional and contralateral invasive breast cancer) should be cytologically/histologically confirmed. Distant 
recurrence  were  diagnosed  by  radiological  examination  and/or  histopathological  confirmation  when 
metastatic lesion was easily accessible for biopsy.

FACIT-Fatigue 
The  FACIT-Fatigue  score  ranges  from  0  to  52  with  higher  scores  indicating  less  fatigue,  and  a  score 
difference of 3 points  defined as clinically meaningful. Separate analyses were conducted for patients who 
had  received  prior  neoadjuvant  chemotherapy  and  patients  who  had  received  standard  post-surgical 
adjuvant chemotherapy because the timing  of chemotherapy had the  potential  to impact  fatigue outcome 
differently. 
Change from baseline at 6 and 12 months for FACIT-Fatigue in patients receiving neoadjuvant and adjuvant 
chemotherapy is presented in Table 22. 
Regarding FACIT-Fatigue Score, differences that were detected were not clinically meaningful (adjusted LS 
mean change scores between the olaparib and placebo at Months 6 and 12 for both the  prior neoadjuvant 
(-1.3  at  6  months;  p=0.024  [nominal],  -1.5  at  12  months;  p=0.025  [nominal])  and adjuvant  (-1.3  at  6

EORTC QLQ-C30 
All  EORTC  QLQ-C30  scales range  in  score from  0  to  100,  with  higher  scores on  HRQoL  and  functioning  
scores indicating better HRQoL/functioning  and higher scores on symptom scales indicating worse symptom 
severity. 
Mean  (SD) EORTC QLQ-C30 global  health status/QoL  and  functioning  subscale scores generally remained 
stable for both the olaparib and placebo arms at Months 6 and 12. Small improvements from baseline were 
observed in  global health  status/QoL,  role functioning,  and  social functioning  in  both  arms  at  Months  18 
and 24, with  no statistical  meaningful differences.  
Mean  (SD)  EORTC  QLQ-C30  GI  symptom  scores  (nausea/vomiting)  were  increased  in  the  olaparib  arm 
versus the  placebo arm after 6  and 12 months of treatment  as expected given the  known safety profile of 
olaparib. At Months 18 and 24, scores returned to baseline and were comparable between the olaparib and 
placebo  arms, with  no  clinically  meaningful  differences observed (Table  24).  For  the  prior neoadjuvant 
group, small  increases in  scores for diarrhoea were observed in the  olaparib arm versus the placebo arm 
after 6 and 12 months of treatment, with  scores returning to baseline and comparable to placebo at 18 and 
24  months.  For the  adjuvant group, diarrhoea scores generally remained stable  for both the  olaparib and 
placebo arms across all timepoints.   
Change from baseline for EORTC QLQ-C30 subscale scores in patients receiving neoadjuvant and adjuvant 
chemotherapy are presented in  Table 24.

The  pivotal study  OlympiA only included  patients  with  germline  mutations  of  BRCA (gBRCAm).  The  MAH 
submitted  additional  clinical  evidence to  support  the  claimed indication  that  included  patients  with  both 
germline and somatic BRCA mutations.

2.7.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  applicant  provided data  from  the  randomised, double  blind,  controlled, multi-centre  phase III  study 
OlympiA  to  support  the  proposed  use  of  olaparib  as  monotherapy  for  the  adjuvant  treatment  of  adult 
patients  with  BRCA1/2-mutations  (germline  /  somatic)  who  have  HER2  negative  high  risk  early  breast 
cancer who have previously been treated with  neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy.  
The dose of olaparib in OlympiA (300  mg bd  tablets) was selected based on data from the  Phase I  study, 
D0810C00024  (Study  24).  Study  24  was  a  formulation  comparison  study  and  the  findings  provided 
information on the efficacy, PK/PD, safety and tolerability profiles of the olaparib tablet. Study 24 explored 
the  safety data  and tumour  shrinkage data across a number  of different  doses and  schedules of olaparib 
tablet  or  capsule  in  an  advanced  gBRCA  mutated  ovarian  cancer  population.  The  results  of  this  study 
supported the use of 300  mg bd tablet dose for Phase III studies.  
On  28  February  2019  (EMEA/H/C/003726/II/0020)  Olaparib  100mg/150mg  tablets  were  approved  in  a 
breast  cancer  indication  for  the  treatment  in  monotherapy  of  adult  patients  with  germline  BRCA1/2- 
mutations,  who have HER2  negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (based on the results of 
the pivotal study OlympiAD).  
Considering the  data  from study OlympiA,  the proposed recommended dose of  Lynparza in  monotherapy 
or in  combination with  endocrine therapy in  the  treatment  of early breast cancer is 300  mg  (two  150  mg 
tablets) taken twice  daily, equivalent to  a total  daily dose of 600  mg (see SmPC section 4.2). The 100  mg 
tablet is available for dose reduction. Prescribers should refer to the full product information of the endocrine

therapy  combination  partner(s)  (aromatase  inhibitor/anti-oestrogen  agent  and/or  LHRH)  for  the 
recommended posology. 
For  what  concern  treatment  duration,  the  choice  of  the  one-year  duration  was  based  on  the  available 
efficacy and  safety  information  (due  to  potential  safety  issues, e.g.  MDS/AML)  at  the  time  of  the  study 
design in the  early breast cancer setting.  Therefore, it is  recommended that patients  are treated for up to  
1 year, or until disease recurrence, or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first.   
OlympiA study  was designed as a comparative study of olaparib monotherapy versus placebo. At the time 
of  study  onset,  endocrine  therapies  for  patients  with  HR+/HER2-  breast  cancer were  the  only  available 
treatment options after completion of neoadjuvant/adjuvant, anthracycline/taxane chemotherapy. Patients 
with  HR+/HER2-  breast  cancer  included  in  OlympiA  were  allowed  to  have  concurrent  treatment  with 
endocrine  therapy  as  per  local  guidelines.  Overall,  89.5%  of  them  received  an  endocrine  concomitant 
therapy during study (see discussion below). The control arm of OlympiA study for RH+/HER2-  patients  is 
therefore considered to be placebo + endocrine therapy for this  group of patients. 
The  choice  of  comparator  was  also  discussed  in  light  of  available results  from  a  clinical  trial  evaluating 
capecitabine in the adjuvant treatment of TNBC breast cancer (Masuda et al 2017, CREATE-X study). Based 
on the  results of  the CREATE-X trial  (a trial  in Asian patients  with  HER2-negative  residual invasive breast 
cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy [containing anthracycline, taxane, or both]), the NCCN guidelines 
and ESMO guidelines for early breast cancer were updated to recommend that capecitabine may be offered 
to  high  risk  TNBC  patients  following  optimal  neoadjuvant  chemotherapy  (Cardoso  et  al  2019,  NCCN 
Guidelines 2021).  However, these results were published three years after the  initiation  of study OlympiA 
and the use of additional adjuvant therapy after randomised therapy was not permitted in study OlympiA. 
Capecitabine  is  not  approved in  the  EU  as  adjuvant  treatment  for  breast  cancer.  Overall, the  choice  of 
comparator arm in  study OlympiA is acceptable. 
The OlympiA study was double blinded which  is expected to minimise the risk of bias that could affect the 
interpretation of the IDFS primary endpoint. A somewhat significant rate of premature unblinding  was 
observed, with a twice higher rate in the placebo arm as compared to  olaparib arm. However, these 
treatments disclosures were compliant to protocol rules and mainly due to treatment  discontinuations. A 
differential efficacy and the need to adequately treat patients'  condition when their allocated treatment 
was stopped could explain this imbalance in unblinding rates.  
Patient  distribution  was  generally well  balanced  between  the  2  treatment  arms  with  regard  to  baseline 
demographics, disease characteristics, prior medication and therapy.  
The  majority  of  hormone  receptor  positive  patients  received  concurrent  endocrine  therapy  (86.9%  in 
olaparib  arm  and  92.4%  in  placebo  arm)  mainly  based  on  aromatase  inhibitors  (52.6%,  n=171)  and 
tamoxifen (40.3%,  n=131).  This  is  consistent  with  clinical  practice and  the  most  recent  ESMO  Guideline 
(Cardoso et  al  2019)  and  NCCN  Guidelines  (NCCN  Guidelines  2021).  The  34  (10.5%)  hormone  receptor 
positive patients  who did  not receive endocrine therapy were mostly  primarily ER  zero/PgR positive or ER 
low (1 to 10%). Current clinical practice guidelines recommend the use of endocrine therapy in ER positive 
breast cancer defined as ≥1% by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (ESMO, 2019). It is acknowledged that there 
is  currently  limited  data  on  the  overall benefit  of  endocrine therapies  for  patients  with  low  level (1%  to  
10%)  ER  expression (Iwamoto et  al  2012;  Allison et  al  2020  ;  Burstein  et  al  2021  ;  Schrodi  et  al  2021; 
Villegas et al  2021)  and the  clinical decision to  treat with  endocrine therapy in  OlympiA was  made by the  
treating physician. To adequately reflect the studied population the indication has been reworded to include 
the  use of olaparib is  either as monotherapy or in  combination with  endocrine therapy (see SmPC section 
4.1).

The  imbalances  between  arms  recorded  in  the  use  of  individual  endocrine  therapy  agents  in  hormone 
receptor  positive  patients  in  OlympiA  are  not  considered to  introduce  any  major  biases on  the  efficacy 
results of the study. 
The definitions of high risk of recurrence for patients who  received adjuvant chemotherapy (inclusion 
criteria #3A)  and for TNBC patients who received neoadjuvant therapy (inclusion criteria #3B1)  are 
considered acceptable. In OlympiA, high  risk early breast cancer patients were selected as follows:  
- patients who  received prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy: patients with  either triple negative breast 
cancer (TNBC) or hormone receptor positive breast cancer must  have had residual invasive cancer in the 
breast and/or the resected lymph nodes (non-pathologic complete response) at the  time of surgery. 
Additionally, patients with  hormone receptor positive breast cancer must have had a CPS&EG score of ≥3 
based on pre-treatment clinical and post-treatment pathologic stage (CPS), estrogen receptor (ER) status 
and histologic grade as shown in Table 9  of the  SmPC. 
- patients who  have received prior adjuvant chemotherapy: triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)  patients 
must have had node positive disease or node negative disease with  a ≥2 cm primary tumour; HR 
positive, HER2-negative patients must have had ≥4  pathologically confirmed positive lymph nodes. 
The MAH provided clarifications regarding the CPS&EG scoring system and its  use as a prognostic score 
following neoadjuvant chemotherapy in  several retrospective studies including a large population  of 
patients (Mittendorf  et al 2011,  Abdelsattar et al 2016,  Marmé et  al 2016).  This staging system globally 
showed a statistically  significant stepwise reduction in breast cancer-specific survival with  increasing 
CPS&EG score and was able to  separate patients into more refined subgroups. The SmPC has been 
revised to provide more details about the CPS&EG Scoring and transparent instructions on how high-risk 
ER and/or PgR positive, HER2-negative breast cancer patients  were selected in  OlympiA in the 
neoadjuvant setting  (see SmPC section 5.1). 
The primary objective of OlympiA was to evaluate the effect of adjuvant treatment with olaparib for patients  
with  HER2-negative  (HR+/HER2-  or  TNBC)  early-stage  breast  cancer  on  IDFS  which  is  considered 
acceptable.  A  multiple  testing  procedure  was  employed  across  the  IDFS,  DDFS,  and  OS  endpoints  to  
strongly control the  overall type I error at 5%  2-sided, accounting for any interim analyses on IDFS, DDFS 
and  OS.  At  the  DCO1  date  (27  March  2020),  a  2-sided  significance  level  of  0.005  was  assigned  to  the 
analysis for IDFS and  DDFS and a  2-sided significance level of  0.01  was assigned to  the  analysis for OS. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included DDFS, OS and PRO collected on pertinent  scales regarding olaparib 
safety profile and olaparib indication (FACIT-Fatigue,  EORTC QLQ-C30).   
A  protocol  amendment  was  put  in  place  in  2015  (ROW  CSP  3.0  [21  Oct  2015])  to  update  the  target 
population to include HR+/HER2- patients. Prior to this amendment only TNBC patients were included. Only 
17.7%  of HR+/HER2-  patients were included in  OlympiA representing a total  of 325  patients.  It is  agreed 
that  this  amendment  is  not  considered  to  have  affected  the  interpretation  of  study  results  since  IDFS 
HR+/HER2-  subgroup  analyses showed  HR  point  estimate  consistent  with  overall IDFS  results  (HR  0.70; 
95% CI: 0.38,  1.27 and HR 0.59;  95% CI: 0.46, 0.74  respectively).  
Important  protocol  deviations  were  reported  in  252  patients  (13.7%)  and  were  balanced  between  the 
treatment  arms  (130  patients  [14.1%]  and  122  patients  [13.3%]  in  the  olaparib arm  and  placebo arm, 
respectively). The most  common important  deviation observed in both  treatment  arms was no staging  or 
insufficient staging as required by exclusion criterion 4 with 67 patients (7.3%)  in the olaparib arm and 66 
patients  (7.2%)  in  the  placebo arm not having  all the  required tests  performed prior to  randomisation. A 
total  of  10.2%  of  patients  with  AJCC clinical  stage IA  were  included  in  the  study.  This  population  is  not 
covered by the claimed indication. A post hoc analysis was provided excluding all patients with an important 
protocol  deviations  related  to  eligibility  (n=223)  (data  not  shown).  Results  of  this  post  hoc  exploratory

analysis of IDFS suggested a consistent treatment effect in the intended study population, when compared 
with  the FAS (HR 0.52;  95% CI 0.40, 0.68;  p<0.001). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
OlympiA  met  its  primary  endpoint  showing  a  statistically  significant  improvement  in  IDFS  for  olaparib-
treated  patients  compared to  placebo-treated patients,  reducing  the  risk  of recurrence of disease at  any 
given point in time by 42%  in patients with  gBRCAm, high  risk early-stage breast cancer after standard of 
care  neo/adjuvant  chemotherapy  and  surgery  (HR  0.58;  99.5%  CI:  0.41,  0.82;  p=0.0000073).  The 
difference in the proportion of patients free of invasive disease at 3 years was 8.8% (95%CI, 4.5%-13.0%) 
in favour of olaparib. This benefit is considered clinically meaningful.  
The results  of the sensitivity  analyses of IDFS (including  only  patients with  central pathology review data 
for hormone receptor status  [ER and PgR], using  unadjusted analysis, using  interval censoring, and  using 
RMST method) are considered consistent with  the primary analysis of IDFS. 
The  subgroup  analyses  showed  consistent  effects  with  the  primary analysis  of  IDFS  in  the  FAS  with  a 
treatment  benefit  of  olaparib  over  placebo  evidenced  across  most  of  the  pre-defined  subgroups.  The 
subgroup  of  patients  with  HR+/HER2-  status  who  had  received adjuvant  chemotherapy  (6  events  in  64 
olaparib-treated patients vs 5  events in  65  placebo-treated patients)  showed a HR  point estimate  >1 (HR  
1.36;  95% CI: 0.41, 4.71)  at DCO 1 (27  March 2020).   
Updated  descriptive  analyses of  IDFS  based  on  more  mature  data  (with  median  follow-up  of  3.5  years) 
conducted at the time of the pre-planned second OS interim analysis (DCO2: 12 July 2021) were provided. 
The  updated  analysis with  increased number  of  events  in  the  hormone receptor  positive  prior  adjuvant 
subgroup  (9.4%  and  13.8%  events  for  the  olaparib and  placebo  arm respectively) showed  an  improved 
hazard ratio for IDFS of 0.736  (95%  CI: 0.247,  2.042).  The hazard ratio in this  subgroup of patients  with 
longer follow up and increased maturity of events is consistent with the ITT outcome supporting a treatment 
benefit for olaparib in these patients.  
Treatment with olaparib compared to placebo conferred a numerical benefit in DDFS supporting the positive 
outcome of IDFS. 
The  MAH  provided  updated  OS  results  from  the  second  planned  interim  analysis  (DCO2  12  July  2021). 
Median  duration of  follow-up for OS was  3.5  years in  the olaparib arm and  3.6  years in  the placebo arm. 
The  OS results  showed  statistically  32.2%  numerical  reduction  in  the  risk of  death  at  any  given  point  in 
time (HR  0.68, 98.5%  CI: 0.47, 0.97,  p=0.0091).  At all-time points,  a higher proportion of patients in the  
olaparib arm compared with  the  placebo arm remained alive (1  year [98.0%],  2  years [95.0%],  3  years 
[92.8%]  and  4  years  [89.8%]  compared  with  96.9%,  92.8%,  89.1%  and  86.4%  respectively).  The 
subgroup analyses showed consistent  effects with  the  analysis of OS in  the FAS,  with  a treatment  benefit 
of  olaparib  over  placebo  evidenced  across  all  the  pre-defined  subgroups  (including  the  HR+/HER2- 
population).  
The  incidences of  contralateral breast  cancers (invasive and  non-invasive), new  primary  ovarian cancer, 
new primary fallopian tube cancer, and new primary peritoneal cancer without considering competing risks 
were numerically lower in  the  olaparib arm  compared with  the  placebo arm. However, it  remains  difficult 
to  draw conclusion based on this  low  number of  cases, in addition  longer follow up would  be necessary to 
assess if this potential  benefit persists on long term. 
No  clinically  meaningful  differences  in  HRQoL  were  observed  between  patients  receiving  olaparib  and 
placebo over the course of the study especially on adverse events of special interest (nausea/vomiting and 
diarrhea) and fatigue scores based on results collected on pertinent scales regarding olaparib safety profile 
(FACIT-Fatigue,  EORTC QLQ-C30).  However, no formal hypothesis testing  was performed regarding PROs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/651123/2022 
Page 83/138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Methodologically robust PRO data are needed to be able to conclude on a potential clinical benefit (The use 
of  patient-reported  outcome  (PRO)  measures in  oncology  studies  -  Appendix  2  to  the  guideline  on  the 
evaluation of anticancer medicinal products in man; 1 April 2016  EMA/CHMP/292464/2014).   
The MAH submitted  a justification to support the claimed indication that  include patients with  both 
germline and somatic BRCA mutations.  The MAH  presented data available with  olaparib in the metastatic 
setting  and data available from other PARP inhibitors. These data support a strong biological rationale and 
suggest antitumour  activity in  patients with  sBRCA in this adjuvant setting.  In addition,  similarities 
between the target population (sBRCAm in adjuvant setting)  and the studied population are 
acknowledged. However, the  extrapolation of the efficacy associated with  olaparib observed in patients 
with  germline BRCA mutations  to patients with  tumours with  somatic BRCA mutations in the  early breast 
cancer setting  is considered premature considering the remaining uncertainties. Further evidence to 
support efficacy in patients with  sBRCAm and to address uncertainties related to  safety is required 
including clinical data with  longer follow-up (see also discussion on clinical safety). The indication  is thus 
restricted to germline BRCAm patients  only (see SmPC section 4.1). Section 4.2 of the SmPC has been 
updated accordingly reflecting that patients  must have confirmation of deleterious or suspected 
deleterious gBRCA1/2 mutation using  a validated test before Lynparza treatment  is initiated  for adjuvant 
treatment of HER2  negative high risk early breast cancer. 
2.7.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
A  clinically  relevant  benefit  of  olaparib  has  been  shown  for  both  the  subgroups  of  TNBC  patients  in 
monotherapy and HR+/HER2- patients in association with endocrine therapy as adjuvant treatment of adult 
patients  with  germline  BRCA1/2-mutations  who  have high  risk early  breast  cancer who  have  previously 
been treated with  neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. 
Since  patients  with  a  somatic  mutation  were  excluded  from  study  OlympiA  due  to  unavailability  of  an 
appropriate diagnostic test based on tissue analysis at that time, there are no clinical data available on the 
responsiveness of breast tumours with  sBRCA mutation to olaparib in the early setting. The benefit remains 
uncertain  in  patients  with  sBRCA1/2 mutations  treated  in  early breast cancer  setting.  In  the  absence of 
data  supporting  extrapolation  to  patients  with  somatic  mutation  the  indication  has  been  restricted  to 
germline BRCAm patients  only.  
2.8.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Across the  entire clinical programme, as of 15  June 2021,  approximately 17923  patients  are estimated to  
have received treatment with  olaparib.  
The safety assessment was based primarily on data from OlympiA, the pivotal Phase III study in  gBRCAm 
primary breast cancer patients, where 911 patients received olaparib (300  mg bd tablet). 
Data from OlympiA was supported by data from a pooled safety database of olaparib 300 mg bd tablet data 
from 17 AstraZeneca sponsored monotherapy studies  (n=3045  [including  911 patients  from OlympiA]) as 
described in  Table  32  and larger  pools of  olaparib studies  (olaparib  monotherapy combined  therapeutic 
dose pool, n=3988)  at  the  DCO 27  March 2020  (DCO1).  The MAH  provided updated  safety data  with  the 
DCO 12 July 2021 (DCO2). At DCO2, safety data from 18 studies were pooled to provide data for a total of 
3155  patients  with  advanced solid tumours,  1289  of whom had  breast cancer. Between DCO1 and DCO2, 
Assessment report  
EMA/651123/2022

the total number of patients in the 300  mg bd pool has increased by 110 patients; this was due to addition 
of  data  from patients  who  received olaparib 300 mg bd  monotherapy in  the  VIOLETTE  study.  Data  have 
also been updated for the OlympiA and SOLO3 studies. 
The  primary comparison of  safety was  between the  olaparib and placebo arms  within  the  OlympiA study 
and the  olaparib 300  mg  bd tablet  pool. In addition,  data  were presented for the  larger therapeutic dose 
pool of olaparib studies in summaries of MDS/AML and important potential  risks.

Patient exposure 
Overall  Extent  of Exposure: OlympiA Study 
All except for 21 of the 1836 randomised patients in OlympiA received study treatment (10 patients 
randomised to olaparib and 11  patients randomised to placebo). The OlympiA Safety Analysis Set (SAS) 
consists of 1815 patients  (911 who received olaparib and 904 who received placebo). 
The DCO for the interim analysis for OlympiA was 27 March 2020 (DCO1). At the  time of the  DCO1, 1353 
patients (73.7%)  had completed study treatment per protocol and 39 patients (2.1%)  were still  receiving 
study treatment (19  patients [2.1%]  in the olaparib arm and 20 patients [2.2%]  in the placebo arm). At 
the time of the DCO2 (12 July 2021),  no patients remained on study treatment in  OlympiA; 1389 patients 
(75.7%  of those randomised) had completed treatment per protocol and 426  patients (23.2%  of those 
randomised) had discontinued study treatment.  In total,  674 patients  (73.2% of those randomised) in the 
olaparib arm and 715 patients (78.1%  of those randomised) in the placebo arm completed treatment  per 
protocol. As observed at DCO1, the  most common reason for early discontinuation in  the olaparib arm 
was AEs (98  patients [10.6%]  in the olaparib versus 41 patients [4.5%]  in the placebo arm) and in the 
placebo arm it was recurrence of disease (80 patients  [8.7%] in  the placebo arm versus 
40 patients  [4.3%] in the  olaparib arm). A lower proportion of patients  in the olaparib arm than the 
placebo arm died on study (75  patients [8.1%]  versus 106 patients [11.6%]  in the  FAS, respectively 
(Table 44).  
The treatment duration in OlympiA was capped at 12 months. A summary of the number of patients 
receiving treatment by months is presented in Table  33. A similar proportion of patients  in both 
treatment arms continued to receive treatment over 12 months treatment  duration.  
The majority of patients (76.1%  in the olaparib arm and 81.7% in the placebo arm) received ≥11 months 
with  most patients discontinuing  treatment after 11.5 months  (73.9% in the  olaparib arm and 79.4%  in 
the placebo arm). Only a small number of patients received ≥12.5 months of randomised treatment 
(1.9%  of patients  in the olaparib arm and 0.9% of patients in the  placebo arm).

The proportion of patients  with dose interruptions or reductions was higher in the olaparib arm than in 
the placebo arm. The majority of patients in the olaparib arm had ≤2 interruptions  and 79 patients 
(8.7%)  had ≥3 interruptions. In both arms, AEs were the most common reason for dose reductions. The 
most common reason for dose interruption  were AEs in the olaparib arm and surgery in the placebo arm.

Deaths 
At DCO2, 181 patients had died; 75 patients  (8.1%) in  the olaparib arm and 106  patients (11.6%)  in the 
placebo arm. This represents an additional  36 patients (16  in the olaparib arm and 20 in the placebo arm) 
who died between DCO1 (27  March 2020) and DCO2 (12 July 2021).  Consistent with  data at DCO1, the 
majority of deaths reported in the  study were related to  the disease under investigation  (171 of 
181 deaths [94.5%];  70 patients  in the olaparib arm and 101 patients  in the placebo arm).  At DCO1, 
four patients experienced an AE with  outcome of death (one patient [1.7%]  in the olaparib arm [cardiac 
arrest] and 3 patients  [3.5%] in  the placebo arm [acute myeloid leukaemia, leukaemia, and ovarian 
cancer]) during study treatment  or after the 30-day follow up. At DCO2 one additional patient 
experienced an AE with  outcome of death after the 30-day follow up period; this  patient was in the 
placebo arm and had a fatal AE of pancreatic carcinoma.

Adverse drug reaction 
When  considering  an  event  as an  ADR  for inclusion  in  the  product  information  for olaparib,  all  available 
sources of  data  are  considered, including:  Non-clinical  findings;  Class  effects;  Plausibility  in  light  of  the  
drug’s pharmacology (eg, PARP inhibition); Clinical data from individual studies, pooled analyses, and post-
marketing  reports:  Comparative  incidence  rates  for  the  event  in  placebo-controlled  trials  and  where 
relevant, exposure-adjusted analyses, Indirect comparisons between single arm olaparib studies, or pooled 
datasets  from  the  olaparib  arms  of  multiple  studies,  and  epidemiological  data  in  the  breast  cancer 
population,  Individual  case/case series  reviews,  including  assessment  of  time  to  onset  of  events  and/or 
de-challenge/re-challenge  data  (where  available),  confounding  factors  (eg,  concurrent  medications; 
co-morbidities) and/or the presence or absence of single events which are strongly indicative of an ADR. 
The  safety profile  is  based on  pooled  data  from 4098  patients  with  solid tumours  treated  with  Lynparza 
monotherapy in clinical trials at the  recommended dose.

As observed in the post-marketing setting. No cases  were observed  in the olaparib monotherapy combined 
therapeutic dose pool, therefore incidence  has been determined based on the rule of 3 (3/3988). 
The incidence of MDS/AML events reported in Table 45 are not the same as reported  in Section Myelodysplastic 
Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukaemia and Table 46. In Table 45, MDS/AML events are only reported for AEs with 
an onset date between the date of first dose of continuous  treatment and 30 days following the date of last dose 
of continuous  treatment and do not include events based  on long-term collection of data beyond treatment 
discontinuation  and 30-day follow-up. In Section Myelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukaemia and Table 
46, MDS/AML events are reported based on the long-term collection of data beyond treatment discontinuation 
and 30-day follow-up. 
Includes  Adverse Events with an onset date between the date of first dose of continuous  treatment and 30 days 
following the last dose of continuous  treatment. 
Frequencies of occurrence  of adverse reactions are defined as: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); 
uncommon (≥1/1,000  to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1000); and very rare (<1/10,000) including isolated reports

Haematological  Toxicity 
Anaemia 
Anaemia is the most common haematological effect reported with olaparib treatment. The proposed product 
information includes anaemia as an adverse reaction of olaparib therapy. In OlympiA, the majority of events 
of anaemia were mild or moderate in intensity.  Onset was early, generally in the first 3 months of starting 
olaparib although the risk of developing anaemia remained constant throughout  exposure with no evidence 
of  cumulative  effect.  AEs  of anaemia  were manageable by  interrupting  or  reducing  the  olaparib  dose or 
giving blood transfusions  or other blood preparations in accordance with  local practice. Adverse events of 
anaemia (grouped term) led to temporary dose interruptions in 11.4% of patients and to dose reduction in 
8.5% of patients. In OlympiA, transfusions were reported as either concomitant medications or procedures 
during  treatment and  the  30-day follow-up  period. Overall, 53  patients  (5.8%)  in  the olaparib arm and  8 
patients (0.9%)  in the  placebo arm received a transfusion, with  16  patients (1.8%)  and 2 patients (0.2%) 
receiving >1 transfusion in the  olaparib and placebo arms, respectively. 
Between 2  and  3  months,  21  patients  (2.3%)  in  the  olaparib arm compared to  0  patients  in the  placebo 
arm required a  transfusion. Over time,  fewer transfusions were observed and at  ≥12 months,  there were 
2 patients (0.2%) in the olaparib arm and 2 patients (0.2%) in the placebo arm who required transfusions. 
AEs of anaemia requiring discontinuation occurred in 1.8% of olaparib-treated patients and were consistent 
with  the tablet pool.

Neutropenia, Lymphopenia, Thrombocytopenia and Leukopenia 
The  incidence  of  other  haematological  effects  associated  with  olaparib  such  as  the  grouped  terms 
neutropenia,  thrombocytopenia,  leukopenia,  and  lymphopenia  were  low  in  OlympiA.  These  events  are 
known  ADRs  for  olaparib  and  were  reported  for  a  higher  percentage  of  patients  in  the  olaparib  arm 
compared with  the placebo arm. These events were predominantly Grade 1 or 2  in severity and rarely led 
to permanent discontinuation of treatment.

MDS/AML  is  considered  an adverse event  of  special  interest  (AESI)  and  an  important  identified  risk  for 
olaparib and events are collected beyond the 30-day safety follow-up for the duration of the survival follow-
up.  
A summary of AEs of MDS/AML occurring in OlympiA together with cases in other pivotal studies, the larger 
olaparib monotherapy therapeutic dose pool, and across the clinical trial programme is shown in Table 53.  
Following  the  marketing authorisation  in  December 2014  for olaparib capsules,  and  as  of  15  June  2021, 
there  have  also  been  reports  of  MDS/AML  from  post-marketing  surveillance,  consistent  with  the 
characterisation of the events reported from monotherapy clinical studies.

Nausea and Vomiting 
AEs of nausea and vomiting were reported for a higher percentage of patients in the olaparib arm compared 
with  the  placebo arm  in  OlympiA. These events were predominantly Grades 1  or 2  in  severity and  rarely 
led to permanent discontinuation of treatment in the olaparib arm. Of the 18 olaparib-treated patients with 
DAEs of nausea, 2  were CTCAE Grade 3  events, both of which  recovered; 13 events were CTCAE Grade 2 
and 3 were Grade 1.

Important potential risks 
New  Primary Malignancies (NPM) 
Excluding events of AML  and leukaemia, non-melanoma skin cancers, and histologically-confirmed benign 
events there were 20 patients (2.2%) reporting 21 NPM events in the olaparib arm and 35 patients (3.9%) 
reporting 37 NPM  events in the placebo arm occurring at  any time on treatment or after the  30-day safety 
follow-up period.  
Invasive and  non-invasive  contralateral breast  cancers were  reported  as  AESI  when  deemed  to  be  new 
primary cancer by investigator’s assessment.

New primary malignancies were identified from safety and efficacy outputs. Adverse events of special 
interest in the SOC Neoplasms benign, malignant  and unspecified (including cysts and polyps) with  onset 
date ≤30 days following date of last study treatment  were identified in 6  patients (0.7%)  in the olaparib 
arm and 18  patients (2%) in  the placebo arm and with  onset >30 days after treatment end date in 19 
patients (2.1%)  in the olaparib arm and 27 patients  (3%) in the placebo arm.

Information was drawn from a larger pool of olaparib studies (olaparib monotherapy combined therapeutic 
dose  pool,  n=3988)  as  well  as  from  all  patients  exposed  to  olaparib  during  clinical  development  (ie, 
including  data  from ongoing studies,  blinded  studies,  combination studies,  ESRs, and  the  MAP)  with  data 
for 17923 patients  (as of 15  June 2021).  In this population,  there have been 115  reports of NPMs  out of a 
total  of  17923  patients  estimated  to  have  received olaparib  in  the  clinical  study  programme, giving  an 
estimated cumulative incidence of 0.6%.  
Pneumonitis 
Adverse events  of  pneumonitis  were  routinely  collected  on-treatment  and  during  the  30-day  follow-up 
period only per protocol. Pneumonitis  AEs were not actively solicited beyond the end of the 30-day follow-
up  period. At  DCO2 (12 July  2021),  9  patients  (1.0%)  in  the  olaparib arm and  11  patients  (1.2%)  in  the 
placebo arm had AEs of pneumonitis on treatment or during the safety follow-up period. One patient in the 
placebo arm had an AE of radiation pneumonitis after the 30-day follow up  period.

Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Changes in  the laboratory values for the  haematology parameters of haemoglobin, neutrophils, platelets, 
and lymphocytes are considered ADRs for olaparib. The number and proportion of patients with  maximum 
overall CTCAE Grade during treatment  for selected haematology values are shown in the table below. 
Table 58:  OlympiA: Number (%)  of Patients  with Maximum  Overall  CTCAE Grade During 
Treatment  for Key Haematology  Parameters  (SAS; DCO:  12 July 2021) 
Clinical Chemistry 
A  summary  of  maximum  overall  CTCAE  grade  during  treatment  for  key  clinical  chemistry  parameters 
(creatinine, bilirubin, ALT, AST, and ALP) is presented in Table 59. Changes in clinical chemistry parameters 
were generally mild  or moderate and  transient.  In  the  majority of  patients,  the  maximum CTCAE  Grade 
was 0,  1, or 2  in both  treatment  arms. The  proportion of patients with  Grade 3 or 4  values was  similar in 
the olaparib and placebo treatment arms.

A  summary  of  maximum  overall  CTCAE  grade  during  treatment  for  key  clinical  chemistry  parameters 
(creatinine, bilirubin,  ALT,  AST, and ALP) was  not  reproduced for the  safety update with  the  DCO 12  July 
2021. 
Increases in creatinine 
Mild  elevations  in  creatinine  have  been  observed  with  no  apparent  sequelae  and  with  resolution  on 
discontinuing olaparib, with no change in other renal function biochemistry tests (urea/blood urea nitrogen).   
At the  time of DCO1, No patients  in the olaparib arm had CTCAE Grade 3  or 4  creatinine compared with  1 
patient (0.1%)  in the  placebo arm who had CTCAE Grade 4 creatinine. 
Three patients  (0.3%)  in  the  olaparib arm  of the  OlympiA study  had a  2  grade increase from  baseline in 
laboratory values for creatinine during  the study,  compared with  1  patient (0.1%)  in  the placebo arm; no 
patients  in  either  arm had  a 3  grade increase from baseline and no  patients  in  the  olaparib arm had  a  4 
grade increase from baseline compared with  1 patient (0.1%)  in the placebo arm. 
Laboratory values for creatinine showed an early increase: the median change in creatinine from baseline 
to Week 2 for patients in  the olaparib arm was 8.8  μmol/L compared with  no change for patients in the 
placebo arm. 
Potential for Drug-induced Liver Injury 
There were  no  confirmed  or  suspected  Hy’s  Law  cases.  No  patients  in  the  olaparib  arm of  OlympiA  had 
concurrent  elevations  of  bilirubin  and  ALT/AST.  Although  2  patients  in  the  placebo  arm  had  concurrent 
elevations of ALT  or AST and  bilirubin,  there were alternative explanations for  the  elevated liver  function 
test results in these patients.  
Data for OlympiA and the 300  mg bd tablet pool have been summarised according to the following 
categories for ALT and AST: ≤3×ULN,  >3×ULN  to ≤5×ULN,  >5×ULN  to ≤10×ULN,  >10×ULN  to ≤20
×ULN,  and >20×ULN.

Safety in special populations 
Effect of Race 
The  safety profile in  the  300  mg  bd  pool  for olaparib  in  White,  Asian,  and  other  non-White  patients  was 
generally similar.  Safety  data  are presented  for  the  713  non-White  patients  who  received the  proposed 
dose of 300  mg bd as a monotherapy in the 300  mg bd pool (Table 61).  
The most  common (≥20% patients)  AEs  in the  Asian patient  population  were nausea, anaemia, vomiting, 
fatigue, WBC count  decreased, decreased appetite, and neutrophil  count decreased. The most common (≥
20%  patients)  AEs  in  the  other  non-White  patient  population  were nausea, fatigue,  anaemia, diarrhoea, 
constipation, decreased appetite, and vomiting. 
Adverse events  that  occurred  at  a  higher  incidence  in  Asian  patients  (≥5  percentage  points  difference) 
compared with  White patients were: ALT increased, anaemia, AST increased, decreased appetite, malaise, 
neutrophil  count  decreased, platelet  count  decreased,  upper  respiratory tract  infection,  and  WBC  count 
decreased. Adverse events that occurred at a lower incidence in Asian patients (≥5 % difference) compared 
with  White  patients  were:  abdominal  pain,  arthralgia,  asthenia,  back  pain,  constipation,  diarrhoea, 
dyspnoea, fatigue, headache, and urinary tract  infection. 
Adverse events that  occurred at a higher incidence in other non-White patients  (≥5 percentage points 
difference) compared with  White patients were anaemia, constipation, decreased appetite, hypertension, 
hypokalaemia, and oedema peripheral. Adverse events that  occurred at a lower incidence in other non-
White patients  (≥5 percentage points difference) compared with  White patients were asthenia, nausea, 
and vomiting.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The incidence of AEs leading to  discontinuation of study treatment is presented in  Table 62. AE leading 
to treatment discontinuation  were reported for 10.6%  of patients in the olaparib arm and 4.6% of 
patients in  the placebo arm. The most common AEs leading to discontinuation  of olaparib (reported in ≥
1.0% patients)  were nausea, anaemia, fatigue, and neutrophil count decreased.

Patients with multiple events in the same category were counted only once in that category. Patients with events in more 
than one category were counted once in each of those categories. 
Includes AEs with an onset date between the date of first dose and 30 days following the date of last dose of study 
treatment. 
MedDRA Version 24.0. 
The majority (124 of 142 events) of the events that led to discontinuation of olaparib had resolved, or were 
resolving after  study  treatment  was  stopped.  None  of  the  events  that  led  to  discontinuation  of  olaparib 
were  fatal;  however,  16  AEs  that  led  to  permanent  discontinuation  of  olaparib  were  considered by  the 
investigator to be serious.  
Seventy six of  the 142  discontinuation  events in  the  olaparib arm started  within  30  days of the  first dose 
of study treatment.  For the  majority (122  of 148  events) of events that  led to discontinuation  of olaparib, 
the investigator considered that  the events were causally related to study treatment. 
Dose Reductions/Interruptions Due to Adverse Events 
Adverse events leading to dose reduction  in study  treatment (olaparib or placebo) in ≥2  patients in  either 
treatment  arm of OlympiA occurred in 22.5%  of  patients  in the  olaparib arm and 3.5%  of patients  in  the 
placebo arm.  
The  most  common  AEs  leading  to  dose  reduction  (≥3%  of  patients)  in  the  olaparib  arm  were  anaemia, 
nausea, neutrophil  count  decreased, and  fatigue.  The AEs  that  led  to  dose reduction  in  the  olaparib arm 
were  generally events  known  to be  associated  with  olaparib  or  were  associated  with  the  disease under 
investigation.

2.8.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety assessment is based on data collected from the  phase III OlympiA study  in which  911 patients  
received  olaparib.  The  OlympiA  data  have  been  pooled  with  the  data  from  patients  receiving  olaparib 
300 mg  bd  tablet  in  additional  monotherapy studies  providing a  pooled safety database  of 3155 patients 
(1289  of whom had breast cancer). 
Across  the  entire  clinical  programme,  17923  patients  are  estimated  to  have  received  treatment  with 
olaparib as of 15 June 2021. 
The majority of patients exposed to  olaparib reported adverse events (AEs), which were generally mild to 
moderate in severity and did not lead to  discontinuation. The toxicity of olaparib was often manageable by 
dose  interruptions,  dose  reductions  and  standard  supportive  treatment  as  required.  Overall, the  safety 
findings in olaparib arm of OlympiA were reported at lower frequency than the  300 mg bd pool, except for 
AE  leading  to  discontinuation  of  study  treatment  or  to  dose  reduction  which  were  reported  with  similar 
frequencies.

initially  described the  results of  the  interim analysis 2  of  study OlympiA, with  the  data cut-off  date  of  12 
July  2021  (DCO2).  At  the  time  of  the  DCO2, 1389  patients  (75.7%)  had  completed study  treatment  per 
protocol and no patients  remaned on  study treatment.  The planned duration of treatment  was 12 months  
and  most patients  (76.1%  in  the  olaparib arm and 81.7%  in  the  placebo arm) received ≥11 months  with 
most patients discontinuing  treatment after 11.5 months.   
Adverse events  
The  most  common  AEs  in  the  olaparib  arm  were  nausea  (56.9%),  fatigue  (40.1%),  anaemia  (23.6%), 
vomiting (22.6%), headache (19.6%), diarrhoea (17.6%), neutropenia (16.4%),  WBC decreased (15.8%), 
decreased appetite (13.1%),  dysgeusia (11.7%),  dizziness (11.4%). 
The AE preferred terms (PTs) that were reported at a ≥2% greater frequency in the olaparib 300 mg tablet 
bd  arm  compared  with  the  placebo  arm  were:  anaemia,  decreased  appetite,  diarrhoea,  dizziness, 
dysgeusia,  fatigue,  gastrooesophageal reflux  disease,  headache,  lymphocyte  count  decreased, nausea, 
neutrophil count  decreased, platelet count  decreased, stomatitis, vomiting, and WBC count  decreased. 
Safety and tolerability findings were consistent  between OlympiA and the tablet pool. 
Grade ≥3 AEs had a higher incidence in olaparib arm (24.5% of patients) than in the placebo arm (11.3%). 
Anaemia and  neutropenia were the  only  AEs  Grade ≥3  reported in  ≥5%  of  patients  in  the  olaparib arm 
(respectively 8.7%  and  5.2%  in  the olaparib arm vs.  0.3%  and 0.8%  in  the  placebo arm).  AEs of CTCAE 
Grade 3 or higher had overall lower frequencies in the olaparib arm of study OlympiA compared to the 300 
mg bd olaparib pool (24.5%  vs 36.6%). 
SAEs were reported in a similar proportion of patients in the  olaparib arm (8.7%)  compared with  the 
placebo arm (8.6%). The highest frequency of reported SAEs at the system organ class (SOC) level was 
blood and lymphatic system disorders (2% olaparib vs. 0.1% physician’s choice of chemotherapy). The 
most common SAE in olaparib arm was anaemia (1.6% olaparib vs 0.1% placebo). A low proportion of 
patients had SAEs that were considered by the investigator to be causally related to study treatment 
(3.6%  in the olaparib arm and 0.7% in the placebo arm). Anaemia (14  patients [1.5%]  in the olaparib 
arm) was the  only SAE reported in more than  2 patients. The majority of SAEs had resolved with  either 
no action taken, or following a temporary dose interruption,  delay/dose change or were recovering. SAEs 
were reported at a lower frequency in OlympiA than  in the 300  mg bd pooled dataset (8.7% vs 19.5%).

The  lower  proportion  of  AEs,  AEs  of  CTCAE  Grade ≥3  and  SAEs  compared  with  the  pooled  data  is  likely 
reflective of  the younger age, better  ECOG performance status,  no evidence of disease at  randomisation, 
and capped duration of treatment in the  OlympiA study. 
Overall, the safety and  tolerability data  of olaparib in  OlympiA was considered consistent  with  the  known 
safety profile of olaparib treatment across the various indications studied. 
Most  of the deaths  occurring on  study were related to  the disease under investigation (171  of 181  deaths 
[94.5%];  70  patients  in  the  olaparib arm  and  101  patients  in  the  placebo arm).  Only one  patient  in  the  
olaparib arm experienced an AE leading to death (cardiac arrest) which was not considered related to study 
treatment  by  the  investigator.  The  frequency  of  deaths  for  any  reason  was  lower  for  olaparib-treated 
patients than for patients in the placebo arm (6.5% vs. 9.5% respectively), mainly driven by death related 
to disease under investigation only. The frequency of deaths for any reason was lower for olaparib-treated 
patients  (6.5%)  in  OlympiA  compared to  the  300  mg  bd  pool  (28.8%),  reflecting  a  population  with  an 
overall more favourable disease setting. 
Three deaths in the olaparib arm and one in the placebo arm were reported under “other” (i.e. not reported 
as related to disease under investigation only, and not related to an AE).  For one of them,  cause of death 
was a pulmonary embolism for which relation to treatment could be excluded. For the second event, death 
occurred 113 days after last dose of study treatment (duration  of exposure was 141 days) but information 
available was insufficient to  conclude on relationship with  olaparib. The last  event reported as other was a 
case  of  AML.  Although  previous  exposure  to  platinum  based  chemotherapy  and  taxanes  constituted  
important confounding factors this case should have been counted as an AE leading to death (see discussion 
on the risk of  new primary malignancies further below. 
Dose interruptions or delay and dose reductions 
Dose interruptions  or delay and dose reductions  were reported respectively in 57%  and  25%  patients  on 
olaparib and respectively in 44.8% and 5.2%  patients on placebo. 
A numerically higher proportion of patients in the  olaparib arm (36.2%)  had a dose interruption  due to an 
AE compared with  the proportion of patients  in the placebo arm (14.2%).  In the olaparib arm, the median 
total  intended  treatment  duration  was  similar  to  the  actual  treatment  duration,  which  shows  treatment 
interruptions  did  not  have  a  significant  impact  on  treatment  duration.  Similarly,  a  larger  proportion  of 
patients in the olaparib arm (24.4%)  compared to the placebo arm (3.9%)  had a dose reduction due to an 
AE. 
The  proportion  of  patients  who  reported  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  treatment  was  higher  in  the 
olaparib arm than  in the placebo arm (10.6%  vs 4.6%).  Nausea (2.1%),  Anaemia (1.8%),  fatigue (1.5%) 
and  neutrophils  count  decreased (1%)  were  the  only  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  olaparib  in  one 
percent or more of the  patients  in  the  olaparib arm.  A majority of discontinuation  events  (76/142)  in  the 
olaparib arm started within  30 days of the first dose of study treatment.   
The frequency of treatment  discontinuation  due to  AE in OlympiA study (10.6%)  was higher than  the one 
observed in OlympiAD (metastatic breast cancer; 4.9%).  However, treatment duration was longer in study 
OlympiA (11.5  months)  compared to  study  OlympiAD (8.2  months).  Furthermore, the  rate  of treatment 
discontinuation  observed in  study OlympiA was similar to  the one observed in  the 300  mg pool (9.7%)  in 
which treatment  duration was similar 11.2  months.  
Higher discontinuation rate in the adjuvant setting compared to the metastatic setting have been observed 
with  several treatments  against  breast  cancer.  This  might  be  related  to  different  acceptability  to  drug 
toxicity from patients  in an early curative intent  setting.

ADR and AESI 
No new adverse drug reaction has been identified  based on the data provided. The adverse drug reactions 
(ADRs) identified for olaparib tablets  are adequately described in  section 4.8  of the  SmPC. The frequency 
of  several ADRs  has  been  updated  based  on  pooled  data  from  4098  patients  with  solid  tumours  treated 
with  Lynparza monotherapy in clinical trials at the  recommended dose (see SmPC section 4.8).  
The  adverse  events  of  special  interest  (AESIs)  for  olaparib  are  pneumonitis,  Myelodysplastic 
Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (MDS/AML) and  new primary malignancies. Investigators in OlympiA 
were required to record new primary malignancies and MDS/AML events beyond 30 days after the last dose 
of  olaparib  at  any  point  in  OS  follow-up.  A  causal  relationship  between  olaparib  treatment  and  the  
development or acceleration of new primary malignancies and pneumonitis has not been established. 
In OlympiA, MDS/AML was reported in 0.2% (n=2) of olaparib-treated patients and 0.3% (n=3) of placebo-
treated patients at DCO2 (12 July 2021).  The incidence of MDS/AML in the olaparib arm of OlympiA (0.2%) 
was lower  than  the  incidence reported for olaparib in  PAOLA-1 (0.9%),  SOLO  1  (1.2%),  SOLO  2  (8.2%), 
SOLO  3  (2.2%),  and  Study  19  (1.5%),  and  the  larger olaparib  monotherapy combined therapeutic  dose 
pool  (0.9%).  However,  the  follow-up  period  of  OlympiA  study  was  shorter  than  the  monotherapy  pool. 
Myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia are identified risk associated with  Olaparib (see SmPC 
section 4.4 and 4.8) and will  continue to be closely monitored (RMP). 
In  the  OlympiA study,  at  DCO2 (12  July  2021)  there were 20  patients  (2.2%)  reporting  21  new  primary 
malignancies  (NPM)  events in  the  olaparib  arm  and  35  patients  (3.9%)  reporting  37  NPM  events  in  the  
placebo arm occurring at any time on treatment  or after the 30-day safety follow-up period. The incidence 
of new primary malignancies in the  pool of patients  who received olaparib in monotherapy studies (tablet 
and capsule formulations; all doses of olaparib) was 1% for olaparib (41 patients in a total of 3988 patients). 
The risk of NPM is of particular concern in the adjuvant setting since patients have a longer life expectancy. 
The frequency of NPM  was overall in line  with  previous experiences, even though  slightly  higher  than  the 
frequency reported in the general monotherapy pool and the total clinical trial population. Considering that 
the  median follow-up time  in  OlympiA study  was 3.5  years at  DCO2, no final  conclusion can be drawn  on 
the potential  increase in  risk of NPM.  This  risk will  continue to  be monitored and follow up  safety data will 
be provided in the PSUSA. 
The causes for imbalance of NPM between olaparib and placebo arm remain difficult to assess. Considering 
the low absolute number of cases, a chance finding cannot be ruled out.  
Considering the entire olaparib clinical programme 122 case reports have been received up to 15 June 2021 
(crude  incidence  122/17923;  0.7%).  Overall,  the  majority  of  pneumonitis  AEs  reported  in  the  olaparib 
monotherapy therapeutic dose pool  were mild  or moderate, non-serious, and resolved  without  treatment 
discontinuation. 
The difference in exposure between study OlympiA and previous studies cannot fully explain the difference 
of  pneumonitis  incidence  observed among studies.  It  is  not  possible  to  rule  out  a causal  relation  at  this  
stage. However, considering that appropriate routine risk minimisation activities are implemented through 
the  prescribing  information,  and  that  pharmacovigilance activities  might  not  be  able  to  provide  further 
information  on  the  issue,  the  MAH  proposal  to  remove pneumonitis  from  the  risk  management  plan  is 
considered acceptable. 
Laboratory parameters 
Assessment report  
EMA/651123/2022 
Page 126/138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Changes in  the  laboratory values for the  haematology parameters of haemoglobin,  platelets,  leukocytes, 
neutrophils and lymphocytes are considered ADRs for olaparib. The changes in haematological parameters 
observed in study OlympiA were generally mild or moderate, manageable, and reversible. 
Increases in  creatinine  have  also  been  identified  as  an  ADR  with  olaparib  treatment.  AEs  of  increased 
creatinine were predominantly Grade 1 in severity and none led to permanent discontinuation of treatment. 
The laboratory observations of elevated serum creatinine were not  associated with  renal impairment  and 
had apparently no clinical sequelae. No hepatobiliary or renal safety concerns were identified from a review 
of laboratory and AE data. 
Special populations 
Assessment of the safety of olaparib in patient subgroups among the 300 mg bd pool showed an acceptable 
safety profile regardless of  race, gender, or body weight.  No  dose adjustment  is required on  the  basis of 
patient  age, racial origin, gender or body weight.  The study population  from OlympiA study  differed from 
the safety pool with  an overall younger age. 
It  was  considered  that  the  safety  in  Hormone  Receptor  (HR)  positive  population  should  be  evaluated 
separately as the  patients  received in  a  vast majority an  endocrine therapy in  parallel to  the  olaparib or 
placebo. A separated analysis of adverse events between HR positive patients with concomitant  endocrine 
therapy and the  safety analysis set (SAS) was provided (data  not shown) and did not  revealed differences 
in the safety profile of olaparib between the two  populations. 
The demographics and baseline characteristics of the Myriad gBRCAm subset (n=1539  patients) were 
broadly similar to the FAS (n=1836  patients) except for the different proportions of White  (66.7%  overall 
in the FAS versus 76.8%  overall among Myriad gBRCAm subset) and Asian patients  (28.9% overall in the 
FAS versus 18.3% overall among Myriad gBRCAm subset). This was expected given that  the Myriad test 
was not performed in patients from China. 
The MAH  was requested to justify the proposed extrapolation of safety to patients with tumours harbouring 
somatic  mutations  in  light  of  the  claimed  indication.  In  this  respect,  extrapolation  was  not  considered 
justified  due  to  limited  clinical  data  available  (see  also  discussion  on  clinical  efficacy).  From  a  safety 
perspective, clinical  data  with  a longer  follow-up  to  further  assess the  risk of  AML/MS  and  new  primary 
malignancies in  this disease setting are lacking. 
2.8.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety  profile of olaparib for  patients  in  OlympiA study  is generally consistent  with  the  known safety 
profile of olaparib. It includes gastrointestinal AEs (nausea and vomiting), haematologic toxicity (anaemia) 
and general disorders (fatigue). No  new safety signals were identified from patients  with  gBRCAm, HER2-
negative, high  risk early breast cancer. AEs associated with  olaparib are generally mild  or moderate, and 
manageable with  dose modification  or standard  supportive treatment.  Higher  discontinuation  rate due  to 
AEs was observed in the EBC population compared the MBC Phase 3 study. Many discontinuations occurred 
relatively early during  treatment.  This  might  be  due to  a  lower acceptance of AEs  affecting daily  life in  a 
younger, often actively working patient  population. 
Regarding new primary malignancies, a causal relationship between olaparib treatment  and these adverse 
events has not been established. Therefore, they are still considered as important potential risk for olaparib 
with  ongoing surveillance activities detailed in the  RMP.

2.10.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with  target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted  by the  MAH and has been found acceptable because the changes are limited and do 
not require user consultation with  target patient  groups. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The indication  is for the adjuvant treatment  of adult patients  with  germline BRCA1/2-mutations who  have 
HER2-negative,  high  risk  early  breast  cancer  previously  treated  with  neoadjuvant  or  adjuvant 
chemotherapy. 
High  risk early breast cancer patients were defined as follows:  
• 
patients who  received prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy: patients with  either triple negative breast 
cancer (TNBC) or hormone receptor positive breast cancer must have had residual invasive cancer 
in  the breast and/or the resected lymph nodes (non-pathologic complete response) at  the  time of 
surgery.  Additionally,  patients  with  hormone  receptor  positive  breast  cancer  must  have  had  a 
CPS&EG score of  ≥3  based on  pre-treatment  clinical and  post-treatment  pathologic  stage (CPS), 
estrogen receptor (ER) status and histologic grade as shown in Table 5. 
• 
patients  who  have  received prior  adjuvant  chemotherapy:  triple  negative  breast  cancer  (TNBC) 
patients  must  have  had  node  positive  disease or  node  negative  disease  with  a  ≥2  cm  primary 
tumour;  HR positive,  HER2-negative patients  must  have had  ≥4 pathologically confirmed positive 
lymph nodes.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The  decision  to  treat  patients  with  early  breast  cancer  with  neoadjuvant  or  adjuvant  chemotherapy  in 
addition to surgery/radiotherapy is driven by the consideration of clinical characteristics, tumour stage and 
pathology. Standard neo/adjuvant chemotherapy for HER2 negative early breast cancer is an anthracycline 
and  taxane-based regimen.  The  clinical  practice  guidelines  (ESMO  2019)  recommend  that  a  sequential 
anthracycline/taxane-based regimen be standard of care for the  majority of patients. 
Whilst  platinum compounds are not routinely recommended, the addition of a platinum compound may be 
considered in high risk TNBC patients with  deleterious BRCA1/2 mutations (ESMO 2019).  In high risk 
TNBC patients not  achieving pCR after standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the addition  of adjuvant 
capecitabine post-operatively may be considered (NCCN  Guidelines, ESMO 2019).

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This application is based on the results from the pivotal Phase III, randomised, double-blind, parallel group, 
placebo-controlled, multi-centre study OlympiA (D081CC00006) in which patients with gBRCA1/2 mutations  
and  triple  negative  or  HR+/HER2-  high-risk  early  breast  cancer  who  had  completed  definitive  local 
treatment and neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy were randomised 1:1 to receive either olaparib (300 
mg  bd,  tablet  formulation)  (n=921)  or  matching  placebo  (n=915).  Randomisation  was  stratified  by 
hormone receptor status (HR positive/ HER2 negative versus TNBC), by prior neoadjuvant versus adjuvant 
chemotherapy,  and  by  prior  platinum  use  for  current  breast  cancer  (yes  versus  no).  Treatment  was 
continued for up to 1 year, or until  disease recurrence, or unacceptable toxicity.  
Patients  with  HR+  breast cancer were allowed  to receive concurrent treatment  with  endocrine therapy as 
per local guidelines.  
Central testing at Myriad or local gBRCA testing, if available, was used to establish study eligibility. Patients 
enrolled based on local gBRCA test results provided a sample for retrospective confirmatory testing. Out of 
1836  patients  enrolled  into  OlympiA,  1623  were  confirmed  as  gBRCAm  by  central  testing,  either 
prospectively  or  retrospectively. There  were  no  patients  included  in  OlympiA  tested  for  somatic  BRCA-
mutated tumours. 
The primary endpoint was invasive disease free survival (IDFS) as determined by investigator assessment 
and defined as the time from randomisation to  date of first recurrence, where recurrence was defined as 
invasive loco-regional, distant  recurrence, contralateral invasive breast cancer, new cancer or death from 
any cause. Secondary objectives included OS and distant  disease free survival (DDFS, defined as the time 
from randomisation until  evidence of first distant  recurrence of breast cancer). A hierarchical testing 
strategy was employed. 
3.2.   Favourable effects 
A total of 1836 patients were randomised and 284 IDFS events were observed in the ITT population at the 
time  of  the  efficacy interim  analysis (DCO 27  March  2020).  The  median  follow-up  time  was  2.3  years in 
olaparib  arm  and  2.5  years  in  placebo  arm.  OlympiA  met  its  primary  endpoint  showing  a  statistically  
significant  improvement  in  IDFS  for  olaparib-treated  patients  compared  to  placebo-treated  patients.  A 
reduction  of  the  risk  of  recurrence of  disease was  observed at  any  given  point  in  time  by  42%  in  ITT 
population  (HR  0.58;  99.5%  CI: 0.41,  0.82;  p=0.0000073).  The  difference in  the  percentage of  patients 
invasive disease free at 3  years was 8.8%  (95%CI, 4.5%-13.0%)  between arms in favour of the olaparib 
arm. The observed IDFS improvement is considered clinically meaningful. Updated  descriptive analyses of 
IDFS based on more mature data  (with  median follow-up  of 3.5  years) conducted at  the time  of the  pre-
planned second OS interim analysis (DCO2: 12 July 2021) were consistent. 
Results  from the  analyses of  DDFS were consistent  with  the  ITT  analyses of IDFS  showing  a  statistically 
significant 42.6%  reduction in the risk of distant disease recurrence or death at any given point in time for 
olaparib vs placebo (HR=0.57;  99.5% CI: 0.39,  0.83;  p=0.0000257].  The difference in the  percentage of 
patients  distant  disease free at  3 year DDFS was 7.1%  (95%CI, 3.0%-11.1%)  and is considered clinically 
meaningful.  
At the  second planned analysis (DCO 12  July 2021),  the  OS results (10%  maturity) showed a statistically  
significant  reduction  in  the  risk  of  death  at  any  given  point  in  time  (HR  0.68,  98.5%  CI:  0.47,  0.97, 
p=0.0091).  At all-time points, a higher proportion of patients remained alive in the olaparib arm compared 
with  the placebo arm (1 year [98.0%],  2 years [95.0%],  3 years [92.8%]  and 4 years [89.8%]  compared 
Assessment report  
EMA/651123/2022

with  96.9%,  92.8%,  89.1%  and  86.4%  respectively). The  median  duration  of  follow-up  for  OS was  3.5 
years in the olaparib arm and 3.6 years in the placebo arm. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There are no clinical data available on the responsiveness of breast tumours  with sBRCA mutation  to 
PARPi in the early setting  (see section 3.7.3). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The most common (reported by ≥20% of patients) adverse events reported in the olaparib arm were nausea 
(56.9%),  fatigue (40.1%),  anaemia (23.5%)  and vomiting  (22.6%).  Grade ≥3 AEs had a higher incidence 
in the olaparib arm (24.3%)  than in the  placebo arm (11.3%).   
At DCO2, adverse events of CTCAE Grade ≥3 occurred in 24.5%  of patients in the olaparib arm and 11.3% 
of  patients  in  the  placebo arm.  Anaemia  was  the  only  AEs  Grade ≥3  reported in  ≥5%  of  patients  in  the  
olaparib arm (reported in 8.7%  of olaparib arm versus 0.3%  of placebo arm).  
SAEs were reported in  8.7%  (79/911  patients)  of the  olaparib-arm compared  with  8.4%  (76/904)  of  the 
placebo arm. The most common reported SAE was anaemia (1.6%  olaparib vs 0.1%  placebo). The highest 
frequency  of  reported  SAEs  at  the  system  organ  class  (SOC)  level  were  blood  and  lymphatic  system 
disorders (2.0% olaparib vs 0.1% placebo). For management of anaemia, 53 (5.8%) patients in the olaparib 
arm received transfusion and 8 (0.9%) in the placebo arm, with 16 patients (1.8%) and 2 patients (0.2%) 
receiving >1 transfusion in the  olaparib and placebo arms. 
The  median  total  treatment  duration  to  olaparib  was  similar  to  placebo  (350  vs  358  days).  Dose 
interruptions were reported respectively in 31.4% patients  on olaparib and 11.4% placebo patients.   
Five patients  in the  olaparib arm died from other cause than  the disease under investigation,  two  of them 
qualify as AE leading to  death. One was a cardiac arrest that  happened 1 day after the  last dose and was 
not  found related to  olaparib. The second was a case of AML  with  a date of onset  448  days after olaparib 
discontinuation,  and death happening 295  after date of onset.  
There were 2 (0.2%)  cases of AML/MDS reported in the olaparib arm, including one with  outcome of death 
and 3 (0.3%)  with placebo.  
The incidence  of NPMs  in  the  OlympiA trial  was 2.2%  and  similar with  the  incidences seen in  other  trials 
(SOLO2 [3.6%],  Study 19 [2.9%],  SOLO1 [1.9%],  PAOLA-1 [2.4%]). 
It was reported that  9 (1%)  patients in the olaparib arm and 11 (1.2%) patients in the placebo arm had an 
AE of pneumonitis  on treatment and no patients had AEs of pneumonitis in  the post-follow-up period. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Uncertainties remain on potential  risks of new primary malignancies (NPM)  and pneumonitis.  
Causal relationship between the exposure to  olaparib and  the occurrence of pneumonitis  events could not 
be  established  based  on  available  data.  This  risk  will  continue  to  be  monitored  as  part  of  routine 
pharmacovigilance activities. 
With  regards to  NPM,  the  causality  of  olaparib in  occurrence of  rare  cases of  new  primary malignancies 
could  not  be firmly established  in the  context  of previous courses of chemotherapy.  NPM  will  continue  to 
Assessment report  
EMA/651123/2022

be closely monitored in  the  post-marketing setting.  This is  of particular relevance in  the  adjuvant  setting 
where  patients  have  a  long  life-expectancy.  Hence,  continuous  reporting  of  NPM  occurring  within  the  
duration of OS follow up period in study OlympiA remains necessary.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In study OlympiA, a statistically significant improvement was observed in IDFS, DDFS and OS for olaparib-
treated patients  compared to placebo-treated patients. Treatment with  olaparib was administered for up to 
1 year and the results showed that  there was a 41.9%  reduction in the risk of invasive disease recurrence 
or death at any given point in time with olaparib arm compared to the placebo arm with  8.8% improvement 
in IDFS at 3 years. This is considered clinically meaningful.  
The subgroup analyses of IDFS showed consistent effects with the primary analysis of IDFS in the ITT, with 
the treatment benefit of olaparib over placebo evidenced across all of the pre-defined subgroups.  
Results of  the  analyses of DDFS were consistent  with  the  analyses of IDFS,  with  a  statistically  significant 
benefit of olaparib vs placebo with  a 42.6%  reduction in  the risk of distant  disease recurrence or death  at 
any given point in time. Between-group difference in 3 year DDFS was 7.1  percentage points (95%CI, 3.0-
11.1)  and is considered clinically meaningful.  
Updated OS results from the second planned interim analysis (DCO2 12 July 2021),  with a median duration 
of follow-up of 3.5 years in the olaparib arm and 3.6 years in the placebo arm showed a statistically 32.2% 
numerical  reduction  in  the  risk  of  death  at  any  given  point  in  time  (HR  0.68,  98.5%  CI:  0.47,  0.97, 
p=0.0091). 
The safety profile of olaparib including patients  from OlympiA is generally consistent with  the known safety 
profile of olaparib. No new safety signals were identified from patients  with  gBRCAm HER2-negative  early 
breast cancer of high risk of recurrence and safety findings in olaparib arm of OlympiA were consistent with 
the 300  mg tablet pool.

The toxicity of  olaparib was most  often manageable, including by dose interruptions,  dose reductions and 
standard supportive treatment as required. A relatively higher frequency of treatment discontinuation was 
observed in the  EBC compared with  the MBC  setting.  The risk of  new primary malignancy will  continue to  
be closely monitored and is of particular importance in this earlier disease setting. The SmPC is considered 
to contain relevant safety information on the risks associated with  olaparib and their management. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Despite completion of standard surgery, radiation and neo/adjuvant chemotherapy disease recurrence will 
occur in  a proportion of patients,  generally with  distant  metastatic  lesions, at  which  point  their disease is 
incurable and will  ultimately be fatal.  
Study  OlympiA evaluated the  safety and  efficacy of  olaparib as adjuvant  treatment  in  adult  patients  with 
germline BRCA1/2-mutations who have high risk early breast cancer and who have previously been treated 
with  neoadjuvant  or  adjuvant  chemotherapy.  In  this  study,  olaparib  showed  a  statistically  significant 
improvement in  terms  of  IDFS, DDFS  and OS  compared to  placebo. This  benefit  was  shown  for olaparib 
both  in  monotherapy  and  in  association  with  endocrine therapy  for  the  treatment  of  TNBC  patients  and 
HR+/HER2-  patients  respectively. 
HR+/HER2-  patients who have received prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy were partly selected based on the  
the CPS&EG scoring system to define high risk status.  The MAH provided adequate clarification on the use 
of  CPS&EG  scoring  system  as  a  prognostic  score  following  neoadjuvant  chemotherapy  in  several 
retrospective studies including a large population of patients (Mittendorf et al 2011,  Abdelsattar et al 2016, 
Marmé et al 2016).  The CPS&EG scoring is considered adequately described in section 5.1 of the SmPC to 
inform prescribers. 
The risks associated with  olaparib are manageable and acceptable in the context of the meaningful 
treatment benefit observed with  olaparib in patients with  high risk early breast cancer treated in the 
proposed adjuvant setting.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Clinical data in patients with somatic BRCA-mutated tumours are lacking as this population was not studied 
in  OlympiA  trial.  The  MAH  submitted  supportive  efficacy  data  for  olaparib  and  other  PARP  inhibitor  
treatments  in  gBRCAm, tBRCAm,  and  sBRCAm metastatic  breast cancer  patients. Overall  available data 
support strong  biological rationale and suggest  antitumour  activity in patients  with  sBRCA in  the adjuvant 
treatment  of EBC. However, the  extrapolation of results from patients  with  germline BRCA mutations  who 
developed  early  breast  cancer  to  patients  with  sporadic  breast  cancers  that  harbour  somatic  BRCA 
mutations  in  their  tumours  is  not  considered  justified  for  the  time  being  considering  the  remaining 
uncertainties. Although the mechanistic rationale is acknowledged, the magnitude of the potential effect in 
the  context  of  early breast  cancer is uncertain  and  long-term  safety data  are lacking. The  indication  has 
therefore been restricted to gBRCAm patients only until clinical outcome data for sBRCAm patients become 
available. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Lynparza is positive in the following indication:  Lynparza is indicated as monotherapy 
or in combination with  endocrine therapy for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients with  germline 
BRCA1/2-mutations who have HER2-negative,  high risk early breast cancer previously treated with

Product information (changes highlighted)  as adopted by the CHMP  on 23 June 2022. 
Reminders to the MAH 
1. 
In accordance with Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004  the  Agency makes available a 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) on the  medicinal product assessed by the  Committee for 
Medicinal Products for Human  Use. The EPAR is first published after the granting  of the  initial 
marketing authorisation  (MA) and is continuously updated during the lifecycle of the medicinal 
product. In particular, following a major change to the  MA, the Agency further publishes the 
assessment report of the  CHMP and the reasons for its opinion in favour of granting the change to 
the authorisation, after deletion of any information of a commercially confidential nature. 
Should you consider that the CHMP  assessment report contains commercially confidential 
information, please  provide the  EMA Procedure Assistant your proposal for deletion of 
commercially confidential information (CCI) in “track changes” and with  detailed justification by 
08 July 2022.  The principles to be applied for the deletion of CCI are published on the  EMA website 
at https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/other/heads-medicines-agencies/european-
medicines-agency-guidance-document-identification-commercially-confidential-information_en.pdf 
In addition, should you consider that  the CHMP assessment report contains personal data, please 
provide the EMA Procedure Assistant your proposal for deletion of these data in  “track changes” and 
with  detailed justification by 08 July 2022. We would like to remind you that,  according to  Article 
4(1) of Regulation (EU)  2016/679  (General Data Protection Regulation, “GDPR”) ‘personal data’ 
means any information, relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (the ‘data subject’). 
An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in  particular by 
reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online 
identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, 
cultural or social identity  of that  natural person. 
It is important to  clarify that pseudonymised data are also considered personal data. According to 
Article 4(5) of GDPR pseudonymisation means that  personal data is processed in a manner that  the 
personal data can no longer be attributed  to a specific data subject without  the use of additional 
information (e.g. key-coded data).  
Accordingly, the name and the patient identification  number are two examples of personal data 
which may relate to an identified or identifiable natural person. The definitions also encompass for 
instance: office e-mail address or phone number of a company, data concerning health, e.g. 
information in medical records, clinical reports or case narratives which  relates to an identifiable 
individual.” 
2.

SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR PERJETA (PERTUZUMAB) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Perjeta. The RMP details 
important risks of Perjeta, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information 
will be obtained about Perjeta risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Perjeta’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Perjeta should be 
used.  
This summary of the RMP for Perjeta should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all 
which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Perjeta RMP. 
I. THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR 
Perjeta is authorized for Metastatic Breast Cancer as well as Neoadjuvant & Adjuvant 
Treatment of Early Breast Cancer (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains 
pertuzumab as the active substance and it is given by intravenous infusion. 
Further information about the evaluation of Perjeta benefits can be found in Perjeta’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Agency for 
the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage. 
II. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES TO 
MINIMISE OR FURTHER CHARACTERISE THE RISKS 
Important risks of Perjeta, together with measures to minimize such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about Perjeta’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
• 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
The authorized pack size − the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
The medicine’s legal status − the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with 
or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.  
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected 
continuously and regularly analyzed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate 
action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of  Perjeta is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing Information’ below. 
II.A  List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of Perjeta are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
administered. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks 
are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Perjeta.  Potential 
risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible 
based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs 
further evaluation.  Missing information refers to information on the safety of the 
medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-
term use of the medicine). 
List of important risks and missing information 
Important identified risks 
Infusion-related reactions, Hypersensitivity reactions / 
anaphylaxis 
Congestive heart failure / Left ventricular dysfunction 
Important potential risks 
Oligohydramnios*  
Risk in fertility in humans 
Risk in patients aged 75 years or older 
Lack of efficacy due to immunogenicity 
Missing information 
Risk in pregnant and lactating women    
*Oligohydramnios has not been reported in patients treated with pertuzumab but occurred in cynomolgus 
monkeys administered pertuzumab and in pregnant women treated with trastuzumab. Due to age, prior 
adjuvant treatment, concurrent chemotherapy, the advanced stage of disease and poor prognosis in the 
patient population, the MAH assesses the likelihood of pregnancies to be low. 
II.B   
Summary of Important Risks  
The safety information in the proposed Product Information is aligned to the reference 
medicinal product. 
Important Identified Risk-Infusion-related reactions, Hypersensitivity 
reactions/anaphylaxis 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Randomized clinical trial data 
Based on safety results from WO20698 (CLEOPATRA), 
WO20697 (NEOSPHERE), BO22280 (TRYPHAENA) and 
BO25126 (APHINITY) and MO28047 (PERUSE) 
 
 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
There are currently no reliable predictors of patients who may 
or may not be susceptible to infusion-associated reactions, 
hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis to pertuzumab. Patients with a 
history of asthma, eczema or hay fever (atopy) had a slightly 
increased risk of developing an IRR (on the day of or the day 
after a pertuzumab infusion) than patients who did not have a 
history of atopy but the number of patients with a history of 
atopy was too small for any firm conclusions to be drawn. 
Moreover, patients with a history of atopy did not appear to be 
at increased risk of anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity reactions. 
Importantly, prior and concomitant trastuzumab exposure did 
not appear to reduce or exacerbate the infusion-associated 
events seen with pertuzumab. 
Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADA) in Study WO20698 
Serum samples were assayed for anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) 
to pertuzumab, also known as anti- therapeutic antibodies 
(ATAs) or human anti-human antibodies (HAHA). The 
incidence of ADA was calculated from the total number of 
patients who tested positive for ADA against pertuzumab after 
dosing, divided by the total number of patients who had post 
dose ADA samples available for the ADA analysis. A 
conservative approach was taken for calculating the incidence 
of ADA so that any patient confirmed to have an ADA positive 
sample after dosing was considered positive for ADA, 
regardless of baseline status. 
Since trastuzumab and pertuzumab share the same 
framework structure, differing only in the complementarity 
determining region, it is possible that the positive ADA findings 
in patients treated with Pla+H+D were due to antibodies 
directed toward the common framework portion of pertuzumab 
and trastuzumab. 
In Study WO20698, at the second clinical data cutoff (14 May 
2012), 6.7% (25/372 patients) of placebo-treated patients and 
3.3% (13/389 patients) of pertuzumab-treated patients tested 
positive for ADA. Of these 38 patients, none experienced 
anaphylactic/ hypersensitivity reaction was clearly related to 
the ADA. Patients with detectable ADA were able to continue 
study treatment, sometimes for prolonged periods.

Important Identified Risk - Congestive heart failure / Left ventricular dysfunction 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Clinical trial data 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Based on safety results from WO20697 (NEOSPHERE), 
WO20698 (CLEOPATRA), BO22280 (TRYPHAENA),  
WO29217 (BERENICE),BO25126 (APHINITY)and MO28047 
(PERUSE) 
Risk factors such as age of 60 years or older, prior 
chemotherapy, registration left ventricular ejection fraction 
(LVEF) less than 65%, hypertension and use of 
antihypertensive medications such as angiotensin-converting-
enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin II receptor blockers and β-
blockers were associated with an increased risk of cardiac 
events in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer (Russo et 
al 2014, Anthony et al 2015, Advani et al 2015). 
Anthracycline exposure: Risks for anthracycline-induced 
heart failure include cumulative dosage, age over 70 years, 
earlier or simultaneous radiation to the chest, concurrent 
treatment with other chemotherapeutic cardiotoxic agents, 
examples, taxanes, capecitabine or trastuzumab and pre-
 
 
existing heart disease (Geiger et al, 2010; Fiuza 2009). The 
most important risk factor for late cardiac toxicity is reported 
as the cumulative anthracycline dose (Yeh et al,, Keefe 
quoted in Senkus & Jassem 2011). 
Concurrent trastuzumab. The cardiac changes associated 
with trastuzumab are mostly reversible, do not appear to be 
dose-related and do not involve histological changes in 
cardiac tissue. Identified risk factors include exposure to 
anthracyclines or paclitaxel, low LVEF at baseline, age > 60 
years, obesity, previous heart disease and hypertension. 
Current monitoring of cardiac function uses changes in LVEF 
as a reference for cardiotoxicity.  Age, anthracycline 
exposure, and the presence of cardiovascular risk factors 
predicted cardiac AEs in trastuzumab recipients (Hudis, 
quoted in Guglin et al 2009). No clear relation to a cumulative 
dose of trastuzumab has been described (Geiger et al, 2010). 
After treatment interruption, clinical and subclinical signs of 
heart failure are mostly reversible and reinitiating of 
trastuzumab after recovery is often well tolerated (Geiger et 
al, 2010).  
Adjuvant breast radiotherapy: A relative increase of 30% in 
cardiac deaths was found in women treated with radiotherapy 
before the 1980s (Clark et al quoted in Chargari et al 2011). 
Among patients treated during 1973-82 and receiving 
radiotherapy, the cardiac mortality ratio (left vs. right tumor) 
was 1.58 (1.29-1.95) after 15 years or more and for patients 
diagnosed during 1993-2001, the cardiac mortality ratio was 
0.96 (0.82-1.12) less than 10 years afterwards (Darby et al, 
quoted in Chargari et al 2011). Internal mammary chain 
irradiation increases heart dose exposure particularly when 
outdated techniques are used or in patients with left-sided 
tumors, potentially translating into increased long-term heart 
disease (Chargari et al 2011).

Important potential risks - Oligohydramnios 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Non-clinical study in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys. 
Placental transfer of pertuzumab was confirmed in 
cynomolgus monkeys. Fetal to maternal pertuzumab serum 
concentration ratios were similar across a 10-fold range of 
doses at clinically relevant concentrations (20-fold greater 
than human clinical dose). Pertuzumab-related embryo-fetal 
lethality, oligohydramnios, and microscopic evidence of 
delayed renal development occurred in a study when 
pertuzumab was administered intravenously from Gestation 
Day 19 (GD19) through GD50 to pregnant cynomolgus 
monkeys, the period of organogenesis in this species 
(GD20 = 50). In addition, consistent with fetal growth 
restrictions, secondary to oligohydramnios, lung hypoplasia 
(1 of 6 30 mg/kg and 1 of 2 100 mg/kg), ventricular septal 
defects (1 of 6 30 mg/kg), thin ventricular wall 1 of 2 100 
mg/kg) and minor skeletal defects (external - 3 of 6 30 mg/kg) 
were also noted. Systemic maternal and fetal exposure at 
clinically relevant pertuzumab concentrations was confirmed. 
No clinical studies have been performed in pregnant women. 
 
 
 
 
 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Risk minimization 
measures 
Premenopausal women of childbearing potential are at risk of 
this complication if they become pregnant during treatment. 
Since the median age at diagnosis of HER2-positive breast 
cancer is the mid-50s, at least half the patients likely to 
receive pertuzumab treatment are unlikely to become 
pregnant on the grounds of age alone. In addition, prior 
chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting and concurrent 
chemotherapy in the metastatic setting are likely to reduce the 
chances of conception, implantation and embryogenesis due 
to induction of a premature menopause and the anti-
proliferative effects of chemotherapy. Finally, the advanced 
stage of disease and poor prognosis of patients with MBC 
make pregnancies less likely to occur. Opioid abuse or 
dependence during pregnancy markedly increased the odds 
of oligohydramnios (Maeda et al 2014). Pregnant women with 
sickle cell disease are at increased risk of oligohydramnios 
(Kuo and Caughey 2016). Primiparity is associated with an 
increased rate of oligohydramnios (Wielgos et al 2015).

Important potential risks – Risk in fertility in humans 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
No specific fertility studies in animals have been performed to 
evaluate the effect of pertuzumab.  
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
The Roche Global Safety Database has been reviewed for 
any cases of risk in fertility in humans or fertility disorders. 
The median age at diagnosis of HER2-positive breast cancer 
is the mid-50s, therefore at least half the patients likely to 
receive Perjeta treatment are unlikely to become pregnant on 
the grounds of age alone. In addition, prior chemotherapy in 
the adjuvant setting and concurrent chemotherapy in the 
metastatic setting are likely to reduce the chances of 
conception, implantation and embryogenesis due to induction 
of a premature menopause and the anti-proliferative effects of 
chemotherapy. Finally, the advanced stage of disease and 
poor prognosis of patients with MBC make pregnancies less 
likely to occur.

No Perjeta dose adjustment is required for adult patients of 
any age, including patients aged 65 years or older.

Important potential risks – Lack of efficacy due to immunogenicity 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
The immunogenicity of pertuzumab has been assessed in 
Perjeta clinical trials by evaluating the incidence of anti-drug 
antibodies (ADAs) to pertuzumab at baseline and following 
exposure to pertuzumab (or placebo), and a low incidence of 
ADA formation has been observed.  
Risk factors for the development of ADAs have been 
described in various regulatory guidance documents and 
industry white papers (EMEA 2007; Koren et al. 2008; FDA 
2014). Recommendations on risk-based strategies for 
detection and characterization of antibodies against 
biotechnology products, and include genetic factors, patient 
immune status, and concomitant medications.  However, there 
is currently no way to predict which patients will generate 
ADAs and of these which will lose drug benefits as a result.

Missing information – Risk in pregnant and lactating women 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Pregnant or lactating women were excluded from all Perjeta 
trials. A non-clinical reproductivity study in cynomolgus 
monkeys showed embryo/fetal losses, oligohydramnios, 
delayed renal development (renal hypoplasia) and intrauterine 
death with a dose-related increase in incidence and severity. 
These findings were consistent with evidence that antibodies 
can be transported across the placenta during the period of 
organogenesis in the cynomolgus monkey. Cases of 
oligohydramnios, some associated with fatal pulmonary 
hypoplasia of the fetus, have also been reported in pregnant 
women receiving trastuzumab, which (like pertuzumab) is an 
antibody that targets the HER2 receptor. Professional labeling 
documents indicate that Perjeta should be avoided during 
pregnancy unless the potential benefit for the mother 
outweighs the potential risk to the fetus. Women of child 
bearing potential and female partners of male patients of child 
bearing potential should use effective contraception while 
receiving Perjeta and for 6 months following the last dose of 
Perjeta.   
Because human Immunglobulin G is secreted in human milk, 
and the potential for absorption and harm to the infant is 
unknown, a recommendation should be made to discontinue 
nursing during and after Perjeta treatment, taking into account 
the importance to the mother and the half-life of pertuzumab.

1.1 
Introduction  
Reyataz  (atazanavir/ATV),  in  combination  with  low  dose  ritonavir  (RTV),  is  indicated  for  the 
treatment  of  HIV-1  in  antiretroviral  (ARV)  treatment-experienced  patients.  The  recommended  dose 
for ATV/RTV is 300/100 mg once daily with food. 
The  Marketing  Authorisation  (MA)  of  this  protease  inhibitor  was  granted  on  2  March  2004  on  the 
basis  of  a  pivotal  study  (AI424045  or  045)  in  ARV-experienced  patients where RTV-boosted ATV 
was  compared  to  the  fixed  combination  of  lopinavir  and  ritonavir  (Kaletra,  LPV/RTV).  Given  the 
limited efficacy/safety data derived from study 045 (circa 100 treated patients per arm) the MA was 
granted under exceptional circumstances. 
As part of the post approval commitments, the MAH was requested “to provide clinical data from the 
use  of  atazanavir  boosted  with  ritonavir  within  triple  once  daily  combination  expected  to  be 
increasingly  used  in  clinical  practice  with  the  arrival  of  the  once  daily  ATV/RTV  association” 
(specific obligation clinical number 3). 
The MAH had provided within the initial MA application (MAA) the results of a study performed in 
antiretroviral  naïve  patients  with  atazanavir  unboosted  (400  mg  once  daily,  QD)  compared  to 
efavirenz  (EFV).  Due  to  the  fact  that  this  study  was  flawed  by  methodological  problems,  no  MA 
could  be  granted  in  antiretroviral  naïve  patients  at  the  time  of  the  original  approval.  In  the  USA, 
contrarily to Europe, Reyataz was approved in ARV-naïve and in ARV-experienced patients with the 
following dose recommendation: 400 mg QD with food and 300 mg QD with RTV 100 mg QD with 
food, respectively. 
Within this procedure, the MAH applies for an extension of the therapeutic indication of ATV/RTV 
300/100  mg  QD  to  include  ARV-naïve  patients.  This  indication  is  supported  by  the  48-week  data 
from a randomised open-label study (AI424138 or 138) conducted in ARV-naïve patients to assess the 
efficacy  of  ATV/RTV  compared  to  LPV/RTV,  in  combination  with  a  NRTI  fixed-association  [i.e. 
Tenofovir DF (TDF) + Emtricitabine (FTC)]. 
In support of the ATV/RTV 300/100 mg QD regimen safety profile in ARV-naïve patients, the MAH 
also included in this submission data obtained from a previous study (AI424089 or 089).  
The  96-week  data  of  study  089  were  previously  assessed  by  the  CHMP  (Reyataz  FUM  057).  The 
study was judged open to criticism as regards the efficacy demonstration given that it consisted in the 
comparison  of  two  non  validated  arms  in  antiretroviral  naïve  patients.  This  study  confirmed  the 
CHMP’s  concern  that  the  unboosted  regimen  of  Reyataz  (400  mg  QD)  might  not  offer  an  optimal 
therapeutic  management  to  antiretroviral  naïve  patients  as  compared  to  the  boosted  regimen 
(substantiated  by  the  efficacy  as  well  as  by  the  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  sub  analysis).  Within  this 
submission, however, this study is rather aimed at completing the safety database.  
Moreover, to support proposed changes in the SPC regarding the interaction of ATV/RTV with TDF, 
the MAH has performed a PK substudy within study 138 and a combined statistical analyses of ATV 
PK available data from patients in the current (138) and previous studies (074, 089 and 137). It was 
previously  observed  that  TDF  decreases  the  ATV  plasma  concentrations  through  an  unknown 
mechanism. Therefore, this issue was further explored by the MAH within this submission. 
In addition, the food effect on ATV PK was assessed in study 172, with ATV co-administered with 
RTV. So far, only food effect on unboosted ATV had been assessed. Subsequent to results of study 
172, an updated wording is proposed for the SPC.  
The MAH also submitted updated versions of the Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) and of the 
Pharmacovigilance  System.  Version  1.0  the  Risk  Management  Plan  (RMP)  had  already  been 
submitted and assessed in the framework of the Annex II application EMEA/H/C/494/X/33.

The MAH proposed to update sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SPC. The PL was 
updated accordingly; in addition, the MAH took this opportunity to update the contact details for their 
local representatives in Denmark and Romania.  
1.2 
Toxico-pharmacological aspects – Environmental Risk Analysis  
Within  this  extension  of  indication  variation,  the  potential  environmental  risks  from  the  use  and 
excretion of the active substance ATV were evaluated to support the addition of naïve patients to the 
treatment population. 
This  assessment  has  been  conducted  under  the  EMEA  2006  Guideline  on  the  Environmental  Risk 
Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use.   
Conclusion 
The  Phase  I  Predicted  Environmental  Concentration  of  ATV  in  surface  water  (PECsurface  water)  was 
calculated to be = 0.0015 mg/L or 1.5 µg/L. The estimated PEC exceeded the proposed action limit of 
0.01 µg/L. Therefore a Phase II assessment was needed. Regarding the phase II-Tier A, the evaluation 
of  PEC/PNEC  (Predicted  No  Effect  Concentration  in  surface  water)  ratios  for  surface  water  and 
groundwater all gave ratios below 1 and for microorganisms well below 0.1, indicating that there are 
no specific concerns for the environment. 
However  ATV  appears  to  be  very  slowly  transformed  in  aerobic  and  anaerobic  sediments.  A 
complementary  Chironomid  emergence  study  (OECD  218)  will  be  undertaken  by  the  MAH  and 
results will be provided as soon as possible in order to give a final conclusion on the environmental 
risk assessment for ATV. 
1 (between 3.47 and 3.17 depending of pH) did not exceed the limit value (4.5). However, 
The log Kow
it showed that ATV was moderately lipophilic. In addition, ATV was stable in the environment. This 
could have triggered a study to evaluate bio-concentration factor in fish, but as the elimination half-
life of ATV was short (7 hours) and as it is not requested by the guideline, the lack of this study is 
acceptable.

Clinical aspects – Pharmacology  
PK substudy 138 
Study Design 
This study was designed as a Week 4 Intensive PK Sub-Study of the 96 week Study Comparing the 
Antiviral Efficacy and Safety of ATV/RTV with LPV/RTV, Each in Combination with Fixed Dose 
TDF-FTC  in  HIV-1  Infected  Treatment  Naïve  Subjects.  Its  objectives  were  the  assessment  of  the 
steady  state  pharmacokinetics  of  ATV/RTV  and  LPV/RTV  in  the  presence  of  an  ARV  regimen 
including TDF at week 4 and to compare the differential effect of ATV/RTV and LPV/RTV on the 
pharmacokinetics of TDF at week 4. In addition the comparison of the differential effect of ATV and 
LPV on the pharmacokinetics of RTV at week 4 was done as well as the assessment of the inhibitory 
quotients (IQ) of ATV and LPV at week 4 (when dosed with RTV). 
For this intensive PK substudy, at the week 4 visit, blood for plasma was to be drawn at predose, 0.5, 
1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 h post dosing with ATV/RTV and TDF all given once daily and at predose, 
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 h post dosing with LPV/RTV given twice daily and TDF given once daily. Plasma 
samples  were  analysed  for  ATV,  LPV,  RTV,  and  TDF  (according  to  treatment  regimen) 
concentrations by validated assay methods. 40 subjects were planned of which 39 were analysed. The 
treatment groups were as follows: 
1  Octanol-water  partition  coefficient  (Kow):  A  measurement  of  how  a  chemical  is  distributed  at  equilibrium 
between octanol and water. It is an important parameter and is used often in the assessment of environmental fate 
and transport for organic chemicals. Additionally, Kow is a key variable used in the estimation of other properties.

Treatment Group A (test product): 
ATV: 2 x 150 mg capsules once daily (QD) with food (meal or snack) 
RTV: 1 x 100 mg capsule once daily with food (meal or snack) 
TDF/FTC: 1 x 300/200 mg fixed dose combination tablet once daily (meal or snack) 
Treatment Group B (reference therapy): 
LPV/RTV: 3 x 133/33.3 mg capsules twice daily (BID) (meal or snack) 
TDF/FTC: 1 x 300/200 mg fixed dose combination tablet once daily (meal or snack) 
The following PK parameters were evaluated for ATV, LPV, RTV and TDF: 
•  Cmax: Maximum observed concentration at week 4 
•  Tmax: Time to reach Cmax at week 4 
•  Cmin: Plasma concentration at the end of the intensive PK dosing interval at week 4 
•  AUC(TAU):  Area  under  the  concentration-time  curve,  in  one  dosing  interval  [AUC(TAU)] 
from time  
o  0 to 12 hours for LPV and RTV in the LPV/RPV regimen,  
o  0-24 hours for ATV and RTV in the ATV/RTV regimen, and  
o  0-24 hours for tenofovir in both regimens at week 4. 
•  T-HALF: Dosing interval terminal half-life at week 4. 
For RTV in the LPV/RTV regimen, the following parameter was also estimated: 
•  AUC(0-24): Estimated as 2 times the AUC(TAU) based on 12-hour PK. 
Inhibitory  quotient  (IQ)  was  determined,  calculated  as  the  concentration  at  plasma  trough 
concentration (Cmin) divided by the protein binding adjusted EC90 for each individual subject HIV-1 
strain  for  either  ATV  or  LPV.  The  IQ  of  ATV  was  compared  to  the  IQ  of  LPV  using  analyses  of 
variance performed on log (IQ).  
Outcome 
Pharmacokinetic Population 
Among the 883 subjects randomised in study 138, a total of 39 subjects were enrolled in the intensive 
PK substudy (18 patients in the ATV/RTV arm and 21 patients in the LPV/RTV arm). 
Because  of  extremely  high  values  of  AUC(TAU),  Cmax  and  Cmin  of  TDF  for  one  subject  in  the 
LPV/RTV  group  (pneumonia,  dehydration,  transient  decrease  in  renal  function),  summary  and 
statistical analysis with and without this subject were performed.

Results from table 3 suggest an approximately 24% difference between ATV IQ and LPV IQ when 
co-administered with RTV and TDF. 
Except for one subject in the LPV/RTV treatment group with a considerably higher IQ (IQ = 129), 
there  was  considerable  overlap  in  individual  IQ  values  and  distribution  between  ATV/RTV  and 
LPV/RTV  groups.  Fifteen  (15)  of  17  (88%)  patients  in  the ATV group and all patients in the LPV 
group achieved IQ > 10. There were no subjects from either group with an IQ < 4. The lowest two IQ 
values in the ATV group were 4 and 7; the lowest IQ in the LPV group was 11.

Conclusions regarding PK substudy 138 
The intensive PK assessment at week 4 indicated that when both ATV and LPV were co-administered 
with RTV and TDF, both regimens achieved a comparable IQ. The geometric mean IQ was estimated 
to be 27 for ATV and 36 for LPV, suggesting similar in vivo activity for the two regimens in these 
HIV-treatment naïve patients; no individual subject had an IQ <4. 
Although the difference between the ATV and LPV IQ was calculated to be approximately 24%, the 
90% CI for the ratio of the geometric mean values for ATV vs. LPV included 1.00 (with a wide CI). 
The median IQ (interquantile range) was also similar between both regimens (ATV 35 [20, 50]; LPV 
34 [21, 60]). The lowest IQ in the ATV regimen was 4 (vs. 11 with LPV). Therefore these differences 
were not considered to be relevant. 
TDF  exposures  were  similar  in  both  regimens,  suggesting  ATV/RTV  and  LPV/RTV  increase  TDF 
exposures to a similar extent. 
As expected, this study showed that ATV concentrations were somewhat lower when combined with 
TDF. Nevertheless, as demonstrated by the efficacy results (discussed below), no detrimental clinical 
effect of this lower exposure in combination with TDF was observed. 
Study 172 – Effect of food  
Study Design 
This  was  an  open-label,  randomized,  three-period,  three-treatment,  crossover  study  in  healthy 
subjects.  Subjects  underwent  screening  evaluations  to  determine  eligibility  within  21  days  prior  to 
first study dose. Subjects were admitted to the clinical facility the evening prior to dosing (Day -1) for 
each  period.  Prior  to  Period  1,  42  subjects  were  randomized  to  receive  1  of  6  sequences  of  3 
treatments including:  
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Treatment A 
A single oral dose of ATV 300 mg (2 x 150 mg capsules) with RTV 100 mg (1 x 100 mg capsule) in a 
fasted condition,  
Treatment B 
A single oral dose of ATV 300 mg with RTV 100 mg after consuming a standard light breakfast  
Treatment C 
A single oral dose of ATV 300 mg with RTV 100 mg after consuming a standard high fat breakfast.  
There  was  a  ≥  7  day  washout  period  between  each  dose.  For  each  treatment  period,  subjects  were 
confined to the clinical facility until at least 72 hours post-dose. Blood samples were collected for PK 
analysis  up  to  72  hours  post-dose.  Physical  examinations,  vital  sign  measurements,  12-lead 
electrocardiograms  (ECG),  and  clinical  laboratory  evaluations  were  performed  at  selected  times 
throughout the study. Subjects were closely monitored for adverse events (AEs) throughout the study. 
A  total  of  60  subjects  were  enrolled  and  42  were  treated  in  this  study.    Thirty-nine  (39)  subjects 
completed the study. 
Pharmacokinetic Results 
Study  AI424172  showed  that  a  standard  light  meal  intake  (Treatment  B)  improved  ATV  exposure 
after ATV/RTV dosing, as indicated by 40%, 33%, and 40% increases in Cmax, AUC(INF), and C24, 
respectively. A standard light meal is more representative of patients’ typical daily meals than a high-
fat,  high-calorie  meal  being  used  in  a  standard  food-effect  assessment,  thus  is  more  relevant  to  the 
clinical setting. The increased bioavailability of ATV administered after a light meal was observed in 
the  majority  of  the  subjects  (67%),  and  especially  in  all  10  subjects  who  had  relatively  low  ATV 
exposures  (defined  as  AUC[INF]  below  20,000  ng*h/ml,  and  C24  below  200  ng/ml)  when  dosed 
under fasted condition. 
When ATV/RTV was administered with a high-fat meal (Treatment C), C24 increased by about 33%, 
even though the Cmax and AUC were similar to the fasted condition.

As  the  observed  difference  could  have  been  driven  by  two  outlier  results,  the  analysis  was  redone, 
excluding  the  2  patients  who  had  substantially  higher  C24.  This  re-analysis  showed  a  positive

confirming  an  improvement  for  C24  in  the  majority  of  subjects  when  ATV/RTV  was  administered 
with food (see also table 6).

Conclusions regarding study 172 
When  considering  the  mean  PK  results  but  also the individual data, food intake improves the ATV 
exposure  after  ATV/RTV  dosing,  especially  in  the  area  of  lower  AUC  and  Cmin  values.  Whereas 
food  does  not  reduce  the  variability  of  ATV  PK  parameters  when  co-administered  with  RTV,  it 
favourably impacts the ATV critical C24 values. 
Higher values of Cmin and AUC seemed to be driven by two outlier individuals. The re-analysis for 
the high fat meal showed that, even when excluding the two outlier patients with higher C24 values, 
food still increases the mean C24 value by 28%. 
Taking these results into consideration, the fact that ATV/RTV was administered with food in study 
138,  that  taking  ATV/RTV  in  fasted  state  might  expose  some  patients  to  sub-optimal  ATV 
concentrations,  and  that  the  poor  gastro-intestinal  tolerance  of RTV generally drives an intake with 
food, the recommendation to take ATV/RTV with food should be maintained.  
1.4 
Clinical aspects – Efficacy  
Main study - AI424138 
Design  
Study  138  is  an  ongoing  open-label,  randomised,  multicentre  study  comparing  ATV/RTV  vs. 
LPV/RTV  at  weeks  48  and  96.    The  primary  objective  was  to  determine  the  proportion  of  patients 
who achieved HIV RNA < 50 c/ml at week 48. Important secondary efficacy objectives were to assess 
the proportion of patients who achieved HIV RNA < 50 c/ml at week 96, the proportion of patients 
with HIV RNA < 400 copies/ml (c/ml), the change from baseline in HIV RNA, and the change from

virologic failure were also assessed.

The  study  population  comprised  883  antiretroviral-naïve  patients  with  screening  HIV  RNA  ≥  5000 
c/ml.  Patients  who  received  any  antiretroviral  therapy  within  30  days  prior  to  screening,  or  prior 
antiretroviral  therapy  ≥  1  week  were  excluded,  with  exceptions  granted  for  prior  antiretroviral 
exposure in specific settings, as described by the protocol. Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive ATV/RTV or LPV/RTV, each co-administered with TDF/FTC. Randomisation was stratified 
by qualifying HIV RNA (< 100,000 or ≥ 100,000 c/ml) and geographic region. Treatment continued 
through week 96.   
Statistics  
Study 138 was designed as a non-inferiority study. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion 
of patients with HIV RNA < 50 c/ml at week 48. The principal analysis of the primary endpoint was 
based  on  the  Confirmed  Virologic  Response  (CVR)  Non-Completer  =  Failure  (NC  =  F)  response 
definition.  
Supportive  analyses  used  CVR  Non-Completer  =  Missing  (NC  =  M),  time  to  loss  of  virologic 
response  (TLOVR),  and  Virologic  Response  -  Observed  Cases  (VR-OC)  definitions.  The  efficacy 
endpoints HIV RNA < 50 c/ml and HIV RNA < 400 c/ml at week 48 were both analysed using the 
CVR definition. 
Efficacy analyses were stratified as randomised by qualifying HIV RNA and region. Treatments were 
compared using the difference in proportions (ATV/RTV - comparator) and 95% confidence intervals 
(CI)  based  on  a  stratified  normal  approximation.  ATV/RTV  was  determined  to  be  similar  (non-
inferior)  to  the  comparator  if  the  lower  confidence  limit  (CL) for the difference in proportions was 
greater than -10%. 
Outcome Definitions for HIV RNA < 50 c/ml 
Confirmed Virologic Response (CVR) 
CVR  defines  response  as  confirmed  HIV  RNA  < 50 c/ml  at  week  48  for  NC  =  F.  CVR  uses  the 
TLOVR  definition  of  response  and  failure  but  allows  for  re-suppression  (i.e.,  patients  could  have 
confirmed HIV RNA < 50 c/ml at week 48 having previously experienced virologic rebound).  
The  supportive  analysis  CVR  Non-Completers  =  Missing  (NC  =  M)  excludes  patients  who  do  not 
have  minimum  follow-up  (i.e.,  who  discontinued  prior  to  obtaining  week  48  HIV  RNA).  Minimum 
follow-up was based on the lower boundary of the week 48 visit window, and was defined as at least 
42 weeks of study therapy with HIV RNA on or after 42 weeks.  
Time to loss of virologic response (TLOVR)  
TLOVR  defines  response  at  week  48  as  confirmed  HIV  RNA  <  50  c/ml  through  week  48  without 
intervening  virologic  rebound  or  treatment  discontinuation.  Virologic  rebound  was  defined  as 
confirmed  on-treatment  HIV RNA ≥ 50 c/ml or last on-treatment HIV RNA  ≥ 50 c/ml followed by 
discontinuation. Patients were considered failures if they experienced virologic rebound at or before 
week 48, discontinued before week 48, never responded by week 48, never received study therapy, or 
had  missing  HIV  RNA  at  week  48  and  beyond.  Patients  were  classified  as  completers  if  they  had 
minimum  follow-up,  as  defined  above.  Completers  could  fail  based  only on their HIV RNA results 
without regard to discontinuation. 
Virologic Response - Observed Cases (VR-OC) 
VR-OC  classifies  patients  who  remained  on  study  therapy  as  responders  according  to  a  single  HIV 
RNA  measurement  <  50  c/ml  closest  to  the  planned  week  48  visit  and  within  a  pre-defined  visit 
window.  The  denominator  was  based  on  patients  who remained on study therapy through week 48. 
Patients with HIV RNA ≥ 50 c/ml were considered failures. Patients who remain on study therapy and 
were  missing  their  week  48  measurement  were  responders  only  if  the  previous  and  subsequent 
measurements were < 50 c/ml. 
Treatment Outcomes 
Treatment outcomes at week 48 for HIV RNA < 50 c/ml were tabulated by treatment based on CVR 
(NC  =  F).  Outcome  categories  were  responder  (responder  without  rebound,  or  re-suppressed  after

rebound),  virologic  failure  (virologic  rebound,  never  suppressed  through  week  48  and  on  study  at 
week 48, or discontinued due to insufficient viral load response [as determined by the investigator]), 
discontinued  before  achieving  confirmed  suppression,  discontinued  while  suppressed,  and  never 
treated.  Tabulations  also 
included  reasons  for  discontinuation  before  achieving  confirmed 
suppression,  and  reasons  for  discontinuation  while  suppressed.  Treatment  outcomes  were  based  on 
the primary reason for failure through week 48. 
HIV RNA < 400 c/ml at week 48 
The  proportion  of  patients  with  HIV  RNA  <  400  c/ml  at  week  48  was  assessed  using  methods 
analogous to those used for analysis of HIV RNA < 50 c/ml, including treatment outcomes. 
CD4 Cell Count Changes 
Regimens were compared using the difference (ATV/RTV - LPV/RTV) in mean CD4 changes from 
baseline at Weeks 24 and 48.  
Comparisons  used  difference  estimates  and  95%  CIs  based  on  normal  approximations  stratified  as 
randomised  by  qualifying  HIV  RNA  level  (<  100,000  and  ≥  100,000  c/ml)  and  geographic  region 
(Africa,  Asia,  Europe,  North  America,  South  America).  The  difference  estimate  and  standard  error 
were  computed  within  the  10  randomisation  strata  and  combined  using  a  weighted  average  with 
weights proportional to stratum size (CMH weighting).  
Principal  analyses  used  observed  values,  while  sensitivity  analyses  used  LOCF  to  address  missing 
values  due  to  missed  visits  or  discontinuation. Missing values were replaced with the last available 
measurement in the previous visit window. Baseline was carried forward for randomised subjects who 
had no on-treatment measurements. 
HIV RNA Changes  
HIV  RNA  levels  and  changes  from  baseline  were  summarised  through  week  48  using  observed 
values. Treatment regimens were compared using the difference between ATV/RTV and LPV/RTV in 
mean  HIV  RNA  changes  from  baseline  (log10  c/ml)  at  weeks  24  and  48,  using  the  methodology 
described above for CD4 changes.  
Efficacy Subgroup Analyses and Subpopulation Analyses  
The following key efficacy endpoints at week 48 were tabulated by efficacy subgroups: 
•  Proportions of patients with HIV RNA < 50 c/ml using CVR (NC = F and NC = M) 
•  Proportions of patients with HIV RNA < 400 c/ml using CVR (NC = F and NC = M) 
•  CD4 cell count change from baseline. 
The efficacy subgroups were defined by categories of HIV RNA and CD4 cell count: 
•  Qualifying HIV RNA < 100,000 and ≥ 100,000 c/ml 
•  Baseline HIV RNA < 100,000, 100,000 to < 500,000 and ≥ 500,000 c/ml 
3
•  Baseline CD4 cell count < 50, 50 to < 100, 100 to < 200, and ≥ 200 cells/mm
3
•  Baseline HIV RNA (c/ml) and CD4 cell count (cells/mm
and ≥ 100; ≥ 100,000 and < 100; ≥ 100,000 and ≥ 100 
): < 100,000 and < 100; < 100,000 
Patient disposition, demographics, baseline characteristics and the 3 key efficacy endpoints at week 
48 were tabulated by the subpopulations of gender, race, region, and baseline HBV/HCV co-infection. 
In  addition,  proportions  with  HIV  RNA  <  50  c/ml  and  HIV  RNA  <  400  c/ml  were  tabulated  by 
baseline  HIV  subtype.  Subpopulations  were  gender,  race,  region,  baseline  HBV/HCV  co-infection, 
and baseline HIV subtype. 
Resistance Profiles 
Genotypic  and  phenotypic  resistance  profiles  were  tabulated  for  patients  who  met  criteria  for 
virologic failure through week 48 for HIV RNA ≥ 400 c/ml. Virologic failure was defined using CVR 
(NC = F) as virologic rebound without re-suppression, never suppressed and on study through week 
48, or discontinued due to insufficient viral load response before week 48.

Outcomes 
Patient Disposition 
A  total  of  883  patients  were  randomised  (440  ATV/RTV,  443  LPV/RTV);  878  were  treated  (438 
ATV/RTV,  440  LPV/RTV);  753  (385  ATV/RTV,  368  LPV/RTV)  were  continuing  on  treatment  at 
data  cut-off  (48  weeks)  for  this  analysis  (11  June  2007).  Three  patients  were  randomised  to  the 
LPV/RTV  regimen  but  received  ATV/RTV  during the entire treatment period. These were grouped 
as-randomised  to  LPV/RTV  in  all  efficacy  analyses,  including  VR-OC.  Ninety-seven  patients 
discontinued through week 48 (39 ATV/RTV, 58 LPV/RTV). As of data cut-off for this analysis, 28 
discontinued on or after week 48 (14 on each regimen). The most common (≥ 2% total) reasons for 
discontinuation  through  week  48  were  adverse  event,  poor/non-compliance,  and  withdrawal  of 
consent.  
Demographics and Baseline Disease Characteristics  
Overall,  demographic  characteristics  were  balanced  between  regimens.    The  median  baseline  HIV 
RNA  and  the  proportions  with  baseline  HIV  RNA  >  100,000  c/ml  and  the  proportions  with  CD4 
< 50 cells/mm3 at baseline were balanced. Most patients had baseline CD4 cell counts in the range of 
100 to < 350 cells/mm3. Across treatment groups, 66% of patients had subtype B, including 80% of 
patients  in  Europe,  100%  in  North  America,  and  78%  in  South  America.  Subtype  C  was  more 
frequent in Africa (89%) but infrequent (< 5%) in all other regions. The rates of hepatitis B and C co 
infection were balanced, though only very few cases were present. 
Results 
Summary 
ATV/RTV  was  non-inferior  to  LPV/RTV, as assessed by the primary efficacy endpoint at week 48 
using CVR (NC = F). The lower CL of the difference estimate was greater than the boundary of -10%, 
supporting  non-inferiority.  Non-inferiority  was  confirmed  by  supportive  analyses  for  the  primary 
endpoint (CVR NC = M, VR-OC, and TLOVR) and by analyses of the secondary efficacy endpoint. 
The mean changes from baseline at week 48 in CD4 cell count were comparable.

Primary Endpoint 
HIV RNA < 50 c/ml 
Most  subjects  achieved  HIV  RNA  <  50 c/ml by Week 24. Response rates at Week 48 ranged from 
76% to 89% across regimens, depending on the analysis (see table 7 above). The response rates were 
similar  in  both  groups  and  the  pre-specified  definition  for  non-inferiority  was  achieved,  with  the 
lower bound of the CI being 3.8%. (for CVR (NC=F)).  
When the results were stratified by baseline subgroups, it became evident that for both treatment arms 
the  response  rates  were  lower  (10%)  in  patients  with  a  higher  viral  load  (above  100  000  c/ml)  as 
compared  to  those  with  a  viral  load  below  100  000  c/ml  (see  table  8).  The  effect  of  ATV/RTV 
compared to LPV/RTV was consistent across sub-groups.  
Table 8 
CVR (NC=F) at week 48 by baseline subgroups (HIV RNA <50 c/ml) – As 
Randomised Patients 
The primary efficacy endpoint (HIV RNA <50 c/ml at Week 48) was reassessed using CVR on the 
evaluable  per  protocol  cohort  that  excluded  non-completers  and  patients  with  major  protocol 
deviations.  The  conclusion  of  non-inferiority  of  ATV/RTV  to  LPV/RTV  was  maintained  in  this 
analysis. Response rates were 338/392 (86%) on ATV/RTV and 332/372 (89%) on LPV/RTV, with a 
difference estimate (95% CI 3.0 (-7.6, 1.5) (Table 9).

Treatment outcomes  
Treatment outcomes were based on the primary reason for failure through week 48. Virologic failure 
for HIV RNA < 50 c/ml using CVR (NC = F) was the most frequent reason for not being a responder 
on both regimens. Most patients with virologic failure were never suppressed through week 48, while 
4% on each regimen experienced rebound. Few patients on either regimen discontinued due to death 
or  adverse  events.  Fewer  patients  on  ATV/RTV  discontinued  before  achieving  confirmed  virologic 
suppression or discontinued while suppressed, primarily due to patients’ withdrawal of consent.

Secondary Endpoints 
HIV RNA < 400 c/ml 
Most subjects achieved HIV RNA < 400 c/ml by Week 12. Response rates at week 48 ranged from 
82%  to  96%  across  regimens,  depending  on  the  analysis  (see  table  7  above).  Difference  estimates 
were ≤ 3.8% in magnitude. The treatment outcome of virologic failure using CVR (NC = F) was 6% 
on both regimens. The 3 subjects who were randomised to LPV/RTV but actually received ATV/RTV 
were all responders. Two subjects on LPV/RTV achieved re-suppression after rebound. More subjects 
on  LPV/RTV  had  treatment  outcomes  of  discontinued  before  achieving  confirmed  suppression  and 
discontinued  while  suppressed,  which  was  primarily  due  to  subject’s  withdrawal  of  consent. 
Treatment outcomes were consistent using TLOVR. 
As was the case for the primary endpoint, the non-inferiority margin of 10% was satisfied. The trend 
favoured the LPV/RTV group.

Reduction in log10 HIV RNA from Baseline  
Both regimens resulted in HIV RNA mean decreases from baseline of  ≥ 2.0 log10 c/ml at weeks 4 
and 12, and ≥ 3.0 log10 c/ml at week 24, and this was sustained through week 48. At week 48, the 
mean  decreases  in  HIV  RNA  were  3.09  and  3.13  log10  c/ml  for  ATV/RTV  and  LPV/RTV, 
respectively.  The  proportion  of  patients  with  HIV  RNA  <  50  c/ml  across  regimens  was  86%  (VR-
OC); the limit of quantification (LOQ) of the HIV RNA assay censored the measurement of the actual 
decline in viral load.

The trend seemed to favour the LPV/RTV group. However, as this was an observed case analysis, it is 
likely  to  be  biased  against  ATV/RTV,  as  there  were  fewer  drop-outs  in  that  group.  The  primary 
analysis  of  responders,  where  all  patients  are  included,  was  less  likely  to  be  biased,  and  there  the 
trend favoured ATV/RTV.  
The statistical analysis of the change from baseline at weeks 24 and 48, providing both observed case 
and  ITT  analysis  is  given  in  table  12.  All  of  the  95%  CIs  contained  0,  supporting  the  comparable 
effect of the regimens.2

2 Note that statistical comparisons of HIV RNA changes from baseline were not pre-planned for Study 138. 
1. Unlike CD4 cell count increases, the limit of quantification of the HIV RNA assay censors the measurement of 
the actual decline in viral load. This “floor effect” biases results towards patients with higher baseline values. 
2. HIV RNA change from baseline is a less clinically relevant endpoint for treatment-naive patients, 70% of 
whom achieved HIV RNA <50 c/ml by Week 24. 
3. The study is overpowered to assess HIV RNA changes, and may identify statistically significant differences 
between regimens that are not clinically relevant

CD4 Cell Count Changes from Baseline 
The  change  from  baseline  was  calculated  for  each  treatment  group  at  each  time-point.  Statistical 
analysis was carried out on the change from baseline at weeks 24 and 48 using both the observed data 
only  as  well  as  using  LOCF  to  impute  data  to  replace  missing  values.    No  formal  test  for  non-
inferiority was carried out and so no non-inferiority margin was defined.

The  trend  did  not  favour  ATV/RTV  when  considering  change  from  baseline  in  CD4  count.  The 
analysis  of  observed  data  shows  the  larger  differences,  but  this  is  likely  to  be  biased  as  patients 
withdrawing  before  week  48,  many  due  to  virologic  failure,  were  not  included.  The  analysis  using 
LOCF which accounts for all patients shows smaller differences. The differences in CD4 counts were 
not considered to be of an important magnitude. 
Resistance 
No  patient  on  ATV/RTV  who  had  wild-type  virus  at  baseline  and  who  subsequently  experienced 
virologic failure developed resistance. Among patients with virologic failure on ATV/RTV, emerging 
PI substitutions were observed only in those who entered the study with pre-existing PI substitutions. 
Genotypic and phenotypic resistance profiles were determined for patients who had virologic failure 
through  week  48  for  HIV  RNA  ≥  400  c/ml.  Virologic  failure  was  defined  using  CVR  (NC  =  F)  as 
virologic  rebound  without  re-suppression,  never  suppressed  and  on  study  through  week  48,  or 
discontinuation due to insufficient viral load response before week 48.  
Six  percent  of  patients  had  virologic  failure  through  48  weeks  on  both  regimens  (27/440  on 
ATV/RTV,  26/443  on  LPV/RTV).  Baseline  genotypes were available for 25/27 ATV/RTV patients 
and  22/26  LPV/RTV  patients.  International  AIDS  Society  (IAS)-defined  minor  substitutions  were 
present  in  25/25  and  22/22  baseline  isolates  of ATV/RTV and LPV/RTV virologic failure patients, 
respectively.  
IAS-defined major PI substitutions M46I, V82A, I84V, and L90M were observed in baseline isolates 
of  only  2  patients  with  virologic  failure.  Both  were  randomised  to  ATV/RTV.  One  of  these  had  2 
major PI substitutions at baseline, V82A and L90M; the other had 3 major PI substitutions at baseline, 
M46I,  I84V  and  L90M.  Both  had  ≥  5  additional  minor  substitutions  associated  with  ATV/RTV 
resistance,  and  phenotypic  resistance  to  multiple  PIs,  including  ATV/RTV  and  LPV/RTV,  plus 
phenotypic resistance to FTC, and in one case, TDF. 
No patient on either regimen with virologic failure who had a wild-type isolate at baseline developed 
resistance.  The  ATV-related  major  PI  resistance  substitution,  I50L,  emerged  in  1  patient  on

ATV/RTV.  This  patient  had  a  baseline  isolate  that  was  phenotypically  resistant to ATV/RTV (fold 
change  [FC]  =  19),  LPV/RTV  (FC  =  39),  FTC  (FC  >  43.75)  and  TDF  (FC  =  1.74).  The  baseline 
isolate  had  2  major  and  6  minor  PI substitutions,  2 thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs), and the 
M184V substitution.

was not observed in the on-study isolates from patients with virologic failure on LPV/RTV; however,

Conclusion and Discussion on Clinical Efficacy 
This  study  was  an  open  label  study  because  a  double  blind,  double  dummy  design  would  have 
imposed  a  high  pill  burden  that  might  have  altered  the  study  enrolment.  A  stringent  10%  non 
inferiority margin (in terms of percentage of patients with undetectable viral load (<50 copies/ml) was 
used, which is appropriate.  The chosen endpoint of proportions of patients with HIV RNA levels < 
50  c/ml  is  the  currently  recommended  endpoint  in  HIV-1  trials  evaluating  compounds  for  the 
treatment  of  treatment-naïve  patients  infected  with  HIV-1.  In  addition,  this  study  will  provide  long 
term data at 96 weeks as recommended in the guideline. The MAH has committed to submit the 96 
weeks study report in the first quarter of 2009.  
In line with the pivotal study 45 in antiretroviral experienced patients, TDF was part of the backbone 
therapy.  As  tenofovir  has  been  shown  to  reduce  ATV  AUC  (25%)  and  Cmin  (40%),  the  choice  of 
backbone  could  mitigate  the  efficacy  of  ATV.  Nevertheless,  this  backbone  is  attractive  in  clinical 
practice as a once daily combination for combination ARV treatment.  
The per protocol population (PPP) analysis taking into account protocol deviations, in underlined the 
demonstrated non inferiority result in the “as randomised” population.  
The results for the MAH’s selected populations were compatible with the predefined non inferiority 
margin (-10%). The most borderline situation is observed with the VR-OC, which is expected to be a 
close  to  a  per  protocol  population  (patients  truly  receiving  the  randomised  treatment  during  48 
weeks).  
It  is  noteworthy  that  2  antiretroviral  naïve  patients  in  the  ATV/RTV  arm  were  apparently  infected 
with  circulating  resistant  strains.  These  patients  had  major  PI  substitutions  at  baseline,  including 
M46I,  V82A,  I84V,  and  L90M.  Both  also  had  baseline  phenotypic  resistance  to  the  study  PIs  and 
FTC, and in one case TDF. Both of these patients were randomised to ATV/RTV. 
1.5 
Clinical aspects – Safety   
The  safety  information  presented  by  the  MAH  to  support  the  use  of  ATV/RTV  as  part  of  HAART 
regimens  in  a  patient  population  with  no  or  minimal  exposure  to  prior  antiretroviral  treatment  was 
based primarily on 2 studies: 
-  AI424138 (138): Study 138 compared safety of ATV/RTV to a standard-of-care boosted PI, 
LPV/RTV in treatment-naïve patients through 48 weeks. 
-  AI424089  (089):  Study  089  was  a  supportive  study  that  compared  safety  of  ATV/RTV  to 
unboosted  ATV  and  provided  long-term  safety  data  on  the  use  of  ATV/RTV  in  treatment-
naïve patients through 96 weeks. 
Different  backbone  drugs  were  used  in  these  2  studies,  a  fixed-dose  combination  of  tenofovir  and 
emtricitabine in 138, and stavudine-extended release (XR) and lamivudine in 089. 
Patient exposure 
In  138,  a  total  of  878  patients  were  treated;  441  in  ATV/RTV  and  437  in  LPV/RTV.  In  138,  97 
patients discontinued through week 48 (39 ATV/RTV, 58 LPV/RTV). Adverse Events (AEs) were the 
most common reason for discontinuation on both treatment regimens (10 ATV/RTV, 14 LPV/RTV). 
More patients on ATV/RTV discontinued due to jaundice/hyperbilirubinemia (3 [<1%] vs. 0), while 
more patients on LPV/RTV discontinued due to diarrhoea (4 [<1%] vs. 0).  
In  089,  200  patients  were  randomised;  199  patients  were  treated  (95 ATV/RTV,  104  ATV400). 
Twenty-one (21) patients discontinued through week 48, in addition, 14 patients discontinued on or 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
after week 48 visit and prior to week 96 visit. Discontinuation due to AEs through week 96 was more 
common  for  patients  in  the ATV/RTV than ATV400 regimen (8 patients vs. 3 patients); 5 of these 
in  ATV/RTV  regimen  were  protocol  mandated  (for  persistent  Grade  4 
discontinuations 
hyperbilirubinemia and abnormal blood bilirubin).  
Characteristics of study population 
In  the  pooled  ATV/RTV  population,  median  age  of  all  randomised  patients  was  34  years,  and 
majority  of  patients  were  males  (69%).  The  most  common  race  was  white  (48%),  and  the  most 
common  region  was  South  America  (43%).  Patients’  gender,  age,  race,  and  region  were  consistent 
between studies. 
Co-infection:  In  138,  60  (14%)  patients  in  ATV/RTV  and  51  (12%)  in  LPV/RTV  and  in  089,  17 
(18%) in ATV/RTV and 20 (19%) in ATV400 regimen were HBV and/or HCV positive at baseline.    
Most patients in both studies had normal liver function tests at baseline. In the ATV/RTV regimen, 
Grade  1  to  2  elevations  in  ALT  were  observed  in  14%  (138)  and  16%  (089)  of  patients  and  AST 
elevations were observed in 18% (138) and 12% (089) of patients at baseline. In 138, < 1% patients 
and in 089 no patients had Grade 3 to 4 ALT/AST abnormalities at baseline. In 089, 100% and in 138, 
> 99% patients had normal total bilirubin at baseline. 
In both studies, fasting lipids at baseline were categorised by NCEP (National Cholesterol Education 
Program) guidelines as desirable or optimal.

The median fasting glucose values at baseline in both studies were consistent between regimens (138: 
84 mg/dl, ATV/RTV; 86 mg/dl, LPV/RTV and in 089, 86 mg/dl ATV/RTV; 86 mg/dl, ATV400). 
Adverse events 
All adverse events 
In 138, the overall incidence of AEs of any grade through week 48 was 91% on both ATV/RTV and 
LPV/RTV  regimens.  The  majority  of  AEs  of  any  grade  occurred  in  <  1%  of  patients  in  either 
regimen. Treatment-related AEs through week 48 were 61% and 70% in ATV/RTV and LPV/RTV, 
respectively. Treatment-related AEs that were reported with a higher frequency (≥ 5% difference) on 
the ATV/RTV than LPV/RTV regimen were jaundice (15% vs. < 1%), hyperbilirubinemia (10% vs. 
0), and ocular icterus (8% vs. 0). 
Treatment-related  AEs  that  occurred  with  a  lower  frequency  on  the  ATV/RTV  than  LPV/RTV 
regimen included diarrhoea (11% vs. 46%), nausea (15% vs. 22%), and hypertriglyceridaemia (2% vs. 
8%).  Renal toxicity was 2% on each regimen.  
In  the  pooled  ATV/RTV  population  from  138  and  089  (N  =  536),  through  week  48,  most  (91%) 
patients reported at least 1 AE regardless of relationship to ATV/RTV or the comparator regimens. 
The most frequently reported (≥ 10%) treatment-related AEs (all grades) were jaundice (16%), nausea 
(15%), diarrhoea (12%), ocular icterus (11%), and hyperbilirubinemia (10%).

Grade 2 to Grade 4 adverse events 
In 138, through week 48, the overall incidence of Grade 2 to 4 AEs was 57% for ATV/RTV, and 59% 
for LPV/RTV, and 26% and 30%, respectively for Grade 2 to 4 treatment-related AEs.  
•  Hepatobiliary AEs: Hyperbilirubinemia was the only Grade 2 to 4 treatment-related AE (6% and 
0%) that occurred with a higher frequency (≥ 5 % difference) on the ATV/RTV than LPV/RTV 
regimen, 
•  Gastrointestinal AEs: Diarrhoea was the only Grade 2 to 4 treatment-related AE (2% and 11%) 
that  occurred  with  a  lower  frequency  (≥  5  %  difference)  on  the  ATV/RTV  than  LPV/RTV 
regimen, 
•  Metabolism and nutrition AEs: Grade 2 to 4 treatment-related hypertriglyceridaemia was higher 
in the LPV/RTV (4% vs. < 1%), 
•  Rash  AEs:  The  incidence  of  these  Grade  2  to  4  AEs  was  consistent  in  the  ATV/RTV  and 
LPV/RTV regimens (3% and 2%, respectively).

In  089,  the  overall  incidence  of  treatment-related  Grade  2  to  4  AEs  through  week  48  for  the 
ATV/RTV regimen, was 43% versus 36% for the ATV400 regimen. Treatment-related Grade 2 to 4 
AEs reported with higher frequency (≥ 5% difference) in the ATV/RTV than ATV400 regimen were 
hyperbilirubinemia  and  increased  blood  bilirubin.  Through  week  96  in  089,  the  incidence  rate  of 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
treatment-related Grade 2 to 4 AEs for the ATV/RTV regimen was 48% and for ATV400 was 39%. 
Hyperbilirubinemia was the only Grade 2 to 4 AE and treatment-related AE (15% vs. 7%) reported 
more frequently in the ATV/RTV than ATV400 regimen. 
Overall, the pattern of AEs seen in 138 and 089 was as expected and consistent with the known safety 
profile of ATV/RTV. No unexpected Grade 2 to 4 AEs, regardless of relationship to study drug, were 
apparent from the two studies submitted by the MAH. 
Deaths and Discontinuations due to adverse events 
Deaths 
In 138, 13 deaths were reported: 6 on ATV/RTV; 6 on LPV/RTV; 1 additional enrolled patient was 
hospitalised  prior  to  randomisation  and  subsequently  died.  One  (1)  death  on  LPV/RTV  (case  of 
mesenteric  thrombosis)  was  considered  “possibly  related”  to  study drug; all others were considered 
“unrelated” or “not likely” related to study drug.  
There  were  2  deaths  in  089,  both  in  patients  on  the  ATV400  regimen  and  were  judged  by  the 
investigators to be not related to study drug. One (1) patient died of head injuries sustained in a motor 
vehicle  accident  and  the  other  patient  died  of  metastatic  lung  cancer  after  discontinuation  from  the 
study prior to week 96.  
Discontinuations due to adverse events  
In  138  through  week  48,  11  (2%)  patients  in  ATV/RTV  and  15  (3%)  in  LPV/RTV  discontinued 
therapy because of AEs. All individual AEs leading to discontinuation occurred with an incidence of 
< 1%. Events leading to discontinuation in both regimens were consistent with the known side effect 
profiles  of  the  study  drugs  and  comparison/backbone  treatments.  More  patients  on  ATV/RTV 
discontinued due to jaundice/hyperbilirubinemia (3 [<1%] vs. 0), while more patients on LPV/RTV 
discontinued  due  to  diarrhoea  (4  [<1%]  vs.  0).  The  proportion  of  patients  who  discontinued  due  to 
rash  (<  1%  and  <  1%)  and  rash  generalised  (<  1%  and  0)  was  consistent  between  the  treatment 
regimens.  
In 089, 8 (8%) patients discontinued in ATV/RTV and 3 (3%) discontinued in the ATV400 regimen 
because  of  AEs.  Five  (5)  of  these  discontinuations  from  the  ATV/RTV  regimen  were  protocol 
mandated due to persistent bilirubin elevations. 
Analysis of Safety by Organ System 
Hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice 
In  138  through  week  48,  AEs  of  ocular  icterus,  hyperbilirubinemia,  and  jaundice  (all  grades)  were 
more common on ATV/RTV than LPV/RTV (31% vs. 1%) ; the most frequently reported Grade 2 to 
4 treatment-related AEs that were higher in ATV/RTV than LPV/RTV were hyperbilirubinemia (7% 
vs. < 1%) and jaundice (4% vs. 0%).  
Similar to 138, in 089 through week 48, more patients in ATV/RTV than in ATV400 (52% vs. 31%, 
respectively)  experienced  1  or  more  AEs  (all  grades)  of  ocular  icterus,  hyperbilirubinemia,  and 
jaundice.  In  138,  mean  total  bilirubin  levels  at  week  48  in  ATV/RTV  were  1.9  mg/dl  and  in 
LPV/RTV were 0.5 mg/dl. Mean changes from baseline in total bilirubin levels through week 48 were 
higher in ATV/RTV than in LPV/RTV (1.5 mg/dl and 0.1 mg/dl, respectively). 
For all cohorts and for all grades (i.e. Grade 3 to 4 and Grade 4), the majority of cases of bilirubin 
elevation were total bilirubin measures (predominantly unconjugated bilirubin). This observation, in 
combination  with  the  lack  of  reported  clinical  sequelae  (i.e.,  liver  failure)  for  those  patients  with 
concurrent bilirubin and transaminase elevations are consistent with previous safety analyses of ATV.

Adverse Events by Hepatitis B or C Co-infection 
In  138,  60  (14%)  patients  in  ATV/RTV  and  51  (12%)  in  LPV/RTV  and  in  089,  17  (18%)  in 
ATV/RTV and 20 (19%) in ATV400 regimen were HBV and/or HCV positive at baseline. 
The Grade 3 to 4 AST/ALT and total bilirubin abnormalities in both 138 and 089 through week 48 are 
summarised in the table below:

As expected, co-infected patients experienced higher baseline and on-treatment hepatic transaminase 
levels than those not co-infected. In 138, patients on both ATV/RTV and LPV/RTV who had HBV 
and/or HCV co-infection had higher rates of liver enzyme elevations than the not co-infected patients.   
Higher rates of Grade 3-4 ALT and AST elevations were observed in the ATV/RTV arm compared to 
the LPV/RTV one in the combined group. Randomisation was not stratified by HBV/HCV status in 
the study, making results within these subgroups susceptible to bias. 
To determine whether a specific co-infection subgroup might provide further insight into the clinical 
relevance  of  the  observed  differences,  Grade  3-4  liver  function  elevations  through  Week  48  were 
determined by regimen separately for baseline HBV and HCV co infected patients: 
•  Grade  3-4  AST  elevations  were  higher  on  ATV/RTV  than  LPV/RTV  for  both  HBV  and  HCV 
patients. On ATV/RTV, rates were 3/24 (13%) for HBV patients and 3/39 (8%) for HCV patients. 
Rates were 0% on LPV/RTV for both subgroups.  
•  Grade  3-4  ALT  elevations  were  higher  on  ATV/RTV  than  LPV/RTV  for  HBV  patients:  4/24 
(17%)  versus  1/19  (5%).  Rates  were  consistent  between  regimens  for  HCV  patients:  2/39  (5%) 
versus 2/33 (6%). 
This variety of potential causes (inflammation as a result of immune reconstitution and inflammatory 
syndrome, drug-induced hepatocellular toxicity, or “flares” due to the antiviral effect of tenofovir and 
emtricitabine), in addition to the susceptibility to bias noted above, makes it difficult to assess, in the 
small  numbers  of  co-infected  patients  seen  in  study  138,  if  the  differences  observed  between  the 
regimens, particularly for AST, are of any clinical relevance. 
Lipodystrophy related adverse events 
In 138, few (< 1% in both regimens) lipodystrophy-related AEs were reported through week 48. Only 
acquired lipodystrophy was reported in the ATV/RTV regimens (1 patient); acquired lipodystrophy, 
lipoatrophy and lipohypertrophy were reported in the LPV/RTV regimen (1 patient for each event). 
All  lipodystrophy-related  AEs  were  non-serious  AEs.  One  (1)  AE  of  acquired  lipodystrophy  in  the 
LPV/RTV  regimen  resulted  in  discontinuation  after  333  days  of  dosing;  this  Grade  2  AE  was 
considered certainly related to study drug by the investigator. 
In 089, 2% and 3% of patients on ATV/RTV and ATV400, respectively had lipodystrophy-acquired 
reported  as  an  AE;  3%  and  2%  respectively  had  lipoatrophy  reported  through  week  48.  The  most 
common lipodystrophy-related AEs through both week 48 and week 96 were lipoatrophy (3% to 6% 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and 2% to 4%, respectively) and acquired lipodystrophy (2% to 3% and 3% to 5%, respectively). All 
lipodystrophy-related AEs were non-serious AEs and none resulted in treatment discontinuation. 
A lipodystrophy substudy was planned in study 138 to compare the changes in body fat redistribution 
between  ATV/RTV  and  LPV/RTV  treatment  regimens,  as  assessed  by  the  change  from  baseline  in 
trunk-to-limb  fat  ratio  measured  by  Dual  Energy  Xray  Absorptiometry  (DEXA)  at  week  96.  This 
substudy report will be submitted 3rd quarter 2009. 
Immune reconstitution syndrome adverse events 
In  138,  immune  reconstitution  syndrome  AEs  were  uncommon  (27/878),  fourteen  (14)  events  (3%) 
were reported in the ATV/RTV and 13 (3%) in the LPV/RTV regimen. The most frequently reported 
events  were  hepatitis  flare  (6  events),  Kaposi  Sarcoma  (5  events)  and  Mycobacterium  tuberculosis 
infection (3 events). Among the 27 patients with an immune reconstitution syndrome event, 5 patients 
discontinued therapy on or before week 48 and 3 patients discontinued after week 48. Six (6) of the 8 
discontinuations occurred among patients on the LPV/RTV regimen and the remaining 2 occurred in 
the  ATV/RTV  regimen.  In  138,  there  was  only  1  spontaneous investigator reported serious adverse 
event  (SAE)  of  immune  reconstitution  syndrome.  This  SAE  was  reported  for  1  patient  in  the 
LPV/RTV regimen.  
In 089, immune reconstitution syndrome was not reported as an AE for any patients. 
Renal toxicity adverse events 
Renal  toxicity  AEs  were  uncommon  (≤  2%)  and  consistent  between  ATV/RTV  and  LPV/RTV 
regimen. All renal toxicity AEs occurred with an incidence of < 1%. One (1) patient on each regimen 
discontinued due to a renal AE, Fanconi syndrome on ATV/RTV and proteinuria on LPV/RTV. There 
were  2  cases  (<  1%)  of  nephrolithiasis  on  ATV/RTV  and  1  (<  1%)  on  LPV/RTV;  all  3  were 
considered non-serious AEs. 
Grade  3  to  Grade  4  creatinine  was  reported  in  only  1  subject  on  each  regimen.  Only  1  subject  on 
ATV/RTV and 3 subjects on LPV/RTV required substitution using alternative NRTIs for TDF-FTC 
through Week 48. Renal function was stable overall with no change from baseline in the mean serum 
creatinine  at  Week  48  on  either  regimen.  The  overall  calculated  creatinine  clearance  appeared  to 
fluctuate over time: the median percent changes were -6% and -7% at Week 4 on the ATV/RTV and 
LPV/RTV regimens, respectively, and returned toward baseline values by Week 48, at -1% for both 
regimens. 
Currently, the ATV SPC mentions that when TDF 300mg is co-administered with ATV 300mg and 
ritonavir 100mg, an increase in concentrations of TDF was observed (increase in AUC of 37% with 
90%  confidence  interval  (30-45%)).  Higher  TDF  concentrations  could  potentiate  TDF-associated 
adverse events, including renal disorders. Patients receiving ATV and TDF should be monitored for 
TDF associated adverse events.

Fasting lipid abnormalities 
In clinical studies, ATV (with or without RTV), has been shown to induce dyslipidaemia to a lesser 
extent  than  LPV/RTV.  The  data  available  from  study  138  on  the  lipid  profile  (mean  change  from 
baseline)  are  described  in  treatment-naïve  subjects  (Table  19);  historical  data  for  treatment-
experienced subjects (study 045) are reflected in Table 20.

Overall,  these  data  suggest  that  ATV/RTV  is  associated  with  a  less  negative  lipid  profile  than 
LPV/RTV. However, a clinical study to prove the benefit of these laboratory parameter findings in a 
cardiovascular  outcome  was  found  to  be  too  extensive  to  perform  (forecasted  duration  ca.  8 years, 
enrolment ca. 8,000 patients). As such, the potential clinical benefit remains unproven.  
Fasting glucose abnormalities 
In both studies, through week 48, Grade 3 to 4 fasting glucose abnormalities were infrequent (≤ 1%) 
among treatment regimens. week 96 results in 089 were consistent with those for week 48.

Other observations related to safety 
Collection  of  ECGs  was  not  required  in  either  138  or  089;  however,  there  were  no  episodes  of  PR 
interval  or  QT  prolongation  reported  as  AEs.  Patients  with  known  cardiac  abnormalities  were 
excluded from both studies. 
Conclusion on safety: 
The safety profile with the addition of data for treatment-naïve patients available from 138 and 089 to 
the integrated safety database for the proposed SPC is consistent with the current SPC. No new safety 
signals  were  identified  for  ATV/RTV  than  previously  observed.  The  pattern  of  adverse  events  was 
consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  of  ATV/RTV,  LPV/RTV  and  the  backbone  medicines, 
TDF/FTC. The overall discontinuation numbers and reasons for discontinuation were consistent with 
previous studies.  
Overall, discontinuations due to adverse events prior to week 48 were 2% and 3% on ATV/RTV and 
LPV/RTV, respectively. The majority of liver function test abnormalities were mild to moderate, with 
an incidence of 2% and 1% Grade 3 to Grade 4 ALT for ATV/RTV and LPV/RTV, respectively. As 
expected, the incidence of abnormal bilirubin was greater on ATV/RTV than LPV/RTV (Grade 1 to 
Grade 4: 84% and 4%; Grade 3 to Grade 4: 34% and <1%). 
The  higher  frequency  of  liver  enzyme  elevations  for  co-infected  patients  in  the  ATV/RTV  arm  vs. 
LPV/RTV: 8% vs. 6% for ALT elevation and 8% vs. 0% for AST elevation was most likely due to the 
small  number  of  co-infected  patients  in  the  study,  which  do  not  allow  for  a  relevant  statistical 
comparison between both arms for this population.  
Renal  toxicity  AEs  were  uncommon  (≤  2%)  and  consistent  between  ATV/RTV  and  LPV/RTV 
regimen. All renal toxicity AEs occurred with an incidence of < 1%. One (1) patient on each regimen 
discontinued due to a renal AE, Fanconi syndrome on ATV/RTV and proteinuria on LPV/RTV. There 
were  2  cases  (<  1%)  of  nephrolithiasis  on  ATV/RTV  and  1  (<  1%)  on  LPV/RTV;  all  3  were 
considered non-serious AEs. 
The  use  of  PI-based  highly  active  ARV  treatment  has  been  associated  with  dyslipidaemia.  Clinical 
data suggest that ATV/RTV is associated with a less negative lipid profile than LPV/RTV. However, 
a  clinical  study  to  prove  the  benefit  of  these  laboratory  parameter  findings  in  a  cardiovascular 
outcome  was  found  to  be  too  extensive  to  perform  (forecasted  duration  ca.  8 years,  enrolment  ca. 
8,000 patients). As such, the potential clinical benefit remains unproven.

Risk Management Plan 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  MAH  fulfils  the 
legislative requirements. 
The  CHMP  did  not  require  the  MAH  to  submit  an  updated  risk  management  plan  because  it  had 
recently  been  assessed  in  the  framework  of  the  line  extension  for  ATV  300  mg  hard  capsule 
(EMEA/H/C/494/X/33) and was judged acceptable. No further changes were deemed necessary.

Changes to the Product Information 
Summary of Product Characteristics 
Section 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 
Changes to reflect the new patient populations were introduced in sections 4.1 and 4.2. In section 4.3 
“should” was exchanged for “must” in order to avoid translation ambiguity.  
“Special warnings and precautions for use” 
Section 4.4 
A  statement  underling  the  risk  of  developing  dyslipidaemia  under  HAART,  including  ATV  was 
added.  
“Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction” 
Section 4.5 
This section was updated with data from study 138 in relation to the co-administration of both RTV 
and TDF with ATV. 
“Undesirable Effects” 
Section 4.8 
This  section  was  updated  in  the  light  of  safety  finding  from study 138 and 089, which led to some 
changes in frequency categories for listed ADRs.  
Pharmacodynamic properties 
Section 5.1 
This section was extensively updated in order to reflect both the findings relating to clinical outcome 
as well as resistance in treatment naïve patients. In addition, the section on lipid parameters was taken 
out,  as  the  clinical  benefit  in  terms  of  cardiovascular  outcome  for  patients  cannot  be  proven. 
Therefore, these data might be falsely reassuring.  
Pharmacokinetic properties 
Section 5.2 
The  paragraphs  on  absorption,  food  effect  and  elimination  were  updated  in  order  to  include  the 
findings in the treatment naïve population.  
Package Leaflet 
The section on possible side effects was updated in line with the update in section 4.8.  
Generally, the Product Information was revised in an effort to consistently use British spelling.

Discussion and Benefit Risk Assessment  
Given the once daily dosing possibility of ATV, the extension of indication to include the treatment 
of  antiretroviral  naïve  patients  is  of  interest,  especially  in  view  of  potential  benefit  in  terms  of 
adherence to long-term treatment. 
ATV was originally (2004) developed as an unboosted regimen (400 mg QD) in antiretroviral naïve 
patients in a study where it was compared to efavirenz.  Due to methodological problems this study 
failed to provide a convincing non inferiority demonstration of ATV unboosted to efavirenz (with an 
ultra-sensitive  test  of  50  copies/ml  (secondary  endpoint  in  the  study)  it  was  even  shown  as  being 
inferior).    From  the  beginning  of  the  assessment  it  was  identified  that  an  unboosted  regimen  might 
provide suboptimal PK exposure in some patients. The MAH has performed a study AI424 089 that 
consisted  of  a  comparison  between  the  unboosted  and boosted regimen of ATV (two non validated 
arms in the target population for an EU perspective). This study confirmed the CHMP concerns that, 
from a clinical and PK point of view, the unboosted regimen might be suboptimal.  
The MAH subsequently performed study 138 to support the extension of indication in antiretroviral 
naïve patients in the EU with ATV boosted with ritonavir 300/100 mg QD, this treatment is currently 
recommended for treatment experienced patients.

This study was an open label study, which is regretful. However, it has to be recognised that a double 
blind,  double  dummy  would  have  imposed  a  high  pill  burden  (5  BID)  that  might  have  altered  the 
study  enrolment.  The  stringent  10%  non  inferiority  margin  in  terms  of  percentage  of  patients  with 
undetectable  viral  load  (<50  copies/ml)  was  used,  which  is  appreciated.    Its  long  term  data  at  96 
weeks will be submitted in the first quarter of 2009.  
In line with the pivotal study 45 in antiretroviral experienced patients, TDF was part of the backbone 
therapy.  To  some  extent  this  might  somewhat  mitigate  the  efficacy  of  ATV.  Indeed,  TDF has been 
shown  to  reduce  the  ATV  AUC  (25%)  and  Cmin  (40%)  whereas  no  significant  influence  has  been 
observed  on  lopinavir  exposure.    Nevertheless  this  backbone  is  attractive  in  clinical  practice  and 
allows  the  MAH  to  fulfil  the  specific  obligation  consisting  of  exploring  the  use  of  ATV  in  a  once 
daily HAART combination.  
As  a  main  finding,  the  results  observed  are  well  in  accordance  with  the  predefined  non  inferiority 
margin for this study.  
For both treatment arms the response rate was lower (10%) in patients with a higher viral load (>100 
000 copies/ml) as compared to patients with viral load <100 000 copies/ml.  A similar 3 log copies/ml 
viral load decrease was observed in both treatment arms.  No major concern was raised as regards the 
emergence of resistance.   
No  major  safety  issue  was  raised  in  this  population  of  patients  as  compared  to  the  antiretroviral 
experienced patients.  A trend for a lower rate of dyslipidaemia was observed, however the translation 
of  this  laboratory  parameter  effect  into  a  clinical  benefit  (i.e.  cardiovascular  outcome)  will  remain 
unproven, as a study in support of such an outcome would be unrealistically long and large.  
Hyperbilirubinemia was observed but not perceived as a significant limiting factor of the use of the 
medicinal  product  (accounts  for  <1  %  of  adverse  events  leading  discontinuation).  A  higher  rate  of 
hyperbilirubinemia and a lower rate of diarrhoea as compared to lopinavir/ritonavir were observed. 
CONCLUSION 
On  24  April  2008  the  CHMP  considered  this  Type  II  variation  to  be  acceptable  and  agreed  on  the 
amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet.

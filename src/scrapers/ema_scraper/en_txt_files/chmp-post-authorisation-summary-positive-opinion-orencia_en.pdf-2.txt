On 21 July 2016, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion 
recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Orencia. The 
marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharma EEIG. 
The CHMP adopted a new indication for Orencia in combination with methotrexate as follows: 
“the treatment of highly active and progressive disease in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
not previously treated with methotrexate.”  
For information, the full indications for Orencia will be as follows:2 
“Rheumatoid arthritis 
Orencia, in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for: 
 
the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adult patients who 
responded inadequately to previous therapy with one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic 
drugs (DMARDs) including methotrexate (MTX) or a tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitor 
 
the treatment of highly active and progressive disease in adult patients with

A reduction in the progression of joint damage and improvement of physical function have been 
demonstrated during combination treatment with abatacept and methotrexate.

active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in paediatric patients 6 years of age and older

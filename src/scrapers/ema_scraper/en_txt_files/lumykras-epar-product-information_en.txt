CLINICAL PARTICULARS  
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
LUMYKRAS as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adults with advanced non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) with KRAS G12C mutation and who have progressed after at least one prior line 
of systemic therapy. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Treatment with LUMYKRAS must be initiated by a physician experienced in the use of anticancer 
medicinal products. 
The presence of a KRAS G12C mutation must be confirmed using a validated test prior to initiation of 
LUMYKRAS therapy. 
Posology 
The recommended dose is 960 mg sotorasib (eight 120 mg tablets) once daily, at the same time each 
day. 
Duration of treatment 
Treatment with LUMYKRAS is recommended until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
Missed doses or vomiting 
If less than 6 hours have passed since the scheduled time of dosing, the patient should take the dose as 
normal. If more than 6 hours have passed since the scheduled time of dosing, the patient must not take 
the dose. Treatment should be continued as prescribed the next day.

If vomiting occurs after taking LUMYKRAS, the patient must not take an additional dose on the same 
day, and treatment must be continued as prescribed the next day. 
Dose modifications 
Dosing should be modified based on LUMYKRAS toxicity. The dose reduction rules outlined in 
section 4.2 are based on clinical data. Pharmacokinetic (PK) data do suggest a similar exposure at 
lower sotorasib doses (see section 5.2). Dose reduction levels are summarised in table 1. Dose 
modifications for adverse reactions are provided in table 2 . 
If toxicity events occur, a maximum of two dose reductions are permitted. LUMYKRAS must be 
discontinued if patients are unable to tolerate the minimum dose of 240 mg once daily.

Special populations 
Elderly 
The limited data on the safety and efficacy of LUMYKRAS in patients aged 75 years and older do not 
suggest that a dose adjustment is required in elderly patients (see sections 4.8 and 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment.  
LUMYKRAS is not recommended for use in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) and severe 
(Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild renal impairment (creatine clearance, 
CrCL ≥ 60 mL/min). LUMYKRAS has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe renal 
impairment (CrCL < 60 mL/min). Therefore, caution should be exercised when treating patients with 
moderate, severe and end stage renal impairment (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of LUMYKRAS in the paediatric population in the treatment of non-small 
cell lung cancer. 
Method of administration 
LUMYKRAS is for oral use. The tablets must be swallowed whole. There are no data to support the 
administration of LUMYKRAS if the tablets are chewed, crushed, or split but the tablets can be 
dispersed in water (see below). The tablets can be taken with or without food. 
Administration to patients who have difficulty swallowing solids 
Patients should disperse tablets in 120 mL of non-carbonated, room-temperature water, without 
crushing them. Other liquids must not be used. Patients should stir until the tablets are dispersed into 
small pieces (the tablet will not dissolve completely) and drink it immediately. The appearance of the 
mixture may range from pale to bright yellow. The container must be rinsed with an additional 
120 mL of water, which should be drunk immediately. If it is not drunk immediately, patients must stir 
again to ensure that the tablets are dispersed. The dispersion must be discarded if it is not drunk within 
2 hours. 
If administration through a nasogastric (NG) tube or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube 
is required, follow the process above for the initial dispersion and for the residual rinse of the 120 mg 
tablets. The dispersed suspension and rinse should be administered as per the NG or PEG tube 
manufacturer’s instructions with appropriate water flushes. Administer the dispersion within 2 hours 
of preparation, stored at room temperature. 
4.3  Contraindications  
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use  
Hepatotoxicity 
Sotorasib can cause hepatotoxicity, which may lead to drug-induced liver injury (DILI) and hepatitis. 
Sotorasib has been associated with transient elevations of serum transaminases (ALT and AST). These 
elevations improved or resolved with dose modification or permanent discontinuation of treatment and 
did not result in any cases of liver failure or fatal cases in clinical studies. Among patients who 
experienced hepatotoxicity, 38% had hepatotoxicity leading to dose interruption or dose reduction. 
Overall, 26% of patients with hepatotoxicity received concurrent corticosteroids. Cases of liver 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
enzyme increase can be asymptomatic. Patients should be monitored for liver function (ALT, AST, 
and total bilirubin) prior to the start of LUMYKRAS, every 3 weeks for the first 3 months of 
treatment, then once a month or as clinically indicated, with more frequent testing in patients who 
develop transaminase and/or bilirubin elevations. Based on the severity of the laboratory 
abnormalities, treatment with LUMYKRAS must be stopped until recovered to ≤ grade 1 or to 
baseline grade, and the dose must either be modified or permanently discontinue treatment as 
recommended (see section 4.2). 
Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/pneumonitis 
ILD/pneumonitis occurred in patients treated with LUMYKRAS with prior exposure to 
immunotherapy or radiotherapy (see section 4.8). Monitor patients for new or worsening pulmonary 
symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g. dyspnoea, cough, fever). Immediately withhold 
LUMYKRAS in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis and permanently discontinue LUMYKRAS 
if no other potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis are identified (see section 4.2). 
Hepatic Impairment 
There are no data on the clinical safety and efficacy of multiple doses of LUMYKRAS when 
administered to patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B and C). No dose 
recommendation can be made.  
Lactose intolerance 
LUMYKRAS contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total 
lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
In vitro studies indicate that sotorasib is metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8, CYP3A4, and 
CYP3A5, and is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Sotorasib was an inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 in vitro. Sotorasib is an in vitro inhibitor of CYP2C8, CYP2D6, 
and CYP3A. In vitro studies indicate that sotorasib is an inhibitor of human organic anion transporter 
(OAT)1/3, OATP1B1, Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) and P-gp. 
Effects of other medicinal products on sotorasib 
Acid-reducing agents 
Co-administration of sotorasib with a PPI (omeprazole) or an H2 receptor antagonist (famotidine) led 
to a decrease in sotorasib concentrations. 
Under fed conditions (standard-calorie moderate-fat meals), co-administration of multiple doses of 
omeprazole with a single dose of 960 mg sotorasib decreased sotorasib Cmax by 65% and AUC 
by 57%. Co-administration of a single dose of famotidine given 10 hours prior and 2 hours after a 
single dose of 960 mg sotorasib decreased sotorasib Cmax by 35% and AUC by 38%. 
Under fasted conditions, co-administration of multiple doses of omeprazole with a single dose of 
960 mg sotorasib decreased sotorasib Cmax by 57% and AUC by 42%. Under fasted conditions, 
co-administration of repeat doses of omeprazole with a single dose of 960 mg sotorasib and 240 mL of 
an acidic beverage (non-diet cola) decreased sotorasib Cmax by 32% and AUC by 23%. The clinical 
relevance of the decreased sotorasib exposure when co-administered with omeprazole and cola is 
unclear and efficacy might be reduced. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If co-administration of LUMYKRAS with an acid-reducing agent (such as a PPI or an H2 receptor 
antagonist) is required, LUMYKRAS should be taken with an acidic beverage (such as cola). 
Alternatively, LUMYKRAS should be taken 4 hours before or 10 hours after administration of a local 
antacid. 
CYP3A4 inhibitors 
Co-administration of multiple dose itraconazole (a strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor) did not 
increase sotorasib exposures to a clinically significant extent. No dose adjustment of LUMYKRAS is 
recommended when co-administered with CYP3A4 inhibitors. 
Strong CYP3A4 inducers 
Co-administration of sotorasib with multiple doses of a strong CYP3A4 inducer (rifampicin) 
decreased sotorasib Cmax by 35% and AUC by 51%. Co-administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers 
(e.g. rifampicin, carbamazepine, enzalutamide, mitotane, phenytoin and St. John’s wort) with 
LUMYKRAS is not recommended because they may decrease sotorasib exposure. 
Effect of sotorasib on other medicinal products 
CYP3A4 substrates 
Sotorasib is a moderate CYP3A4 inducer. Co-administration of sotorasib with CYP3A4 substrates led 
to a decrease in their plasma concentrations, which may reduce the efficacy of these substrates. 
Co-administration of sotorasib with midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate) decreased midazolam 
Cmax by 48% and AUC by 53%. 
Avoid co-administration of LUMYKRAS with CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic indices, 
including but not limited to alfentanil, ciclosporin, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, hormonal 
contraceptives, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus and tacrolimus. If co-administration cannot be avoided, 
adjust the CYP3A4 substrate dose in accordance with the current summary of product characteristics. 
CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 substrates 
In vitro data indicated that sotorasib may have the potential to induce CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 
and CYP2C19; the clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. When sotorasib is co-administered 
with medicinal products metabolised by these enzymes, appropriate monitoring is recommended. 
CYP2D6 substrates 
In vitro data indicated that sotorasib may have the potential to inhibit CYP2D6, the clinical relevance 
of these findings is unknown. When LUMYKRAS is co-administered with CYP2D6 substrates (e.g. 
flecainide, propafenone, metoprolol), appropriate monitoring is recommended. 
BCRP substrates 
LUMYKRAS is a weak BCRP inhibitor. Co-administration of LUMYKRAS with a BCRP substrate 
led to an increase in the plasma concentrations of the BCRP substrate, which may increase the effect 
of the substrate. 
Co-administration of LUMYKRAS with rosuvastatin (a BCRP substrate) increased the rosuvastatin 
Cmax by 70% and AUC by 34%. 
When LUMYKRAS is co-administered with a BCRP substrate, including but not limited to lapatinib, 
methotrexate, mitoxantrone, rosuvastatin and topotecan, monitor for adverse reactions of the BCRP 
substrate and reduce the BCRP substrate dose in accordance with its current summary of product 
characteristics. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Effect of sotorasib on P-gp substrates 
Co-administration of sotorasib with digoxin (a P-glycoprotein [P-gp] substrate) increased digoxin Cmax 
by 1.9-fold and AUCinf by 1.2-fold of digoxin administered alone. Co-administration of LUMYKRAS 
with P-gp substrates with narrow therapeutic indices is not recommended. If co-administration cannot 
be avoided, adjust the P-gp substrate dosage in accordance with the current summary of product 
characteristics. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception 
Women of childbearing potential must be advised to avoid pregnancy while on LUMYKRAS. Female 
patients of child-bearing potential receiving LUMYKRAS must use highly effective contraceptive 
methods during treatment and for at least 7 days following the last dose of LUMYKRAS. 
LUMYKRAS may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, and therefore women using 
hormonal contraceptives should add a barrier method. 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of sotorasib in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). LUMYKRAS is not recommended during pregnancy and in 
women of childbearing potential not using contraception. Patients must be informed of the potential 
hazards to the foetus if LUMYKRAS is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant 
while taking LUMYKRAS. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown if sotorasib or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to breast-fed 
newborns/infants cannot be excluded. LUMYKRAS should not be used during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
There are no clinical studies to evaluate the effect of sotorasib on fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
LUMYKRAS has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Elevated liver enzymes 
In clinical studies, transient elevations of serum transaminases were observed (see section 4.4). 
Elevations of ALT occurred in 14% of subjects and elevations of AST in 16% of subjects, with a 
median time to onset of 8 weeks (range: 1 to 42) and 8 weeks (range: 0 to 42), respectively. Elevations 
of ALT resulted in dose interruption and/or reduction in 6.1% of subjects, and elevations of AST 
resulted in dose interruption and/or reduction in 6.1% of subjects. 
ILD/pneumonitis 
In clinical studies, among 359 patients who received LUMYKRAS, ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 
0.8% of patients, all cases were grade 3 or 4 at onset. The median time to first onset for 
ILD/pneumonitis was 2 weeks (range: 2 to 18 weeks). LUMYKRAS was discontinued due to 
ILD/pneumonitis in 0.6% of patients (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Elderly 
In clinical studies, no overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between elderly patients 
(≥ 65 years old) and younger patients (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XX73 
Mechanism of action 
Sotorasib is a selective KRAS G12C (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homologue) inhibitor, which 
covalently and irreversibly binds to the unique cysteine of KRAS G12C. Inactivation of KRAS G12C 
by sotorasib blocks tumour cell signalling and survival, inhibits cell growth, and promotes apoptosis 
selectively in tumours harbouring KRAS G12C, an oncogenic driver of tumourigenesis. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
LUMYKRAS for the treatment of patients with previously treated KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC 
(CodeBreaK 100) 
The efficacy of LUMYKRAS was studied in a single-arm, open-label, multicentre trial (CodeBreaK 
100) that enrolled patients with locally advanced or metastatic KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC who had 
disease progression after receiving prior therapy. Key eligibility criteria included progression on an 
immune checkpoint inhibitor and/or platinum-based chemotherapy and after targeted therapy if 
actionable oncogenic driver mutations were identified, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
Performance Status (ECOG PS) of 0 or 1, and at least one measurable lesion as defined by Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST v1.1). All patients were required to have KRAS G12C-
mutated NSCLC prospectively identified in tumour samples using a validated test (Qiagen 
therascreen® KRAS RGQ PCR Kit) performed in a central laboratory. Patients with renal impairment, 
hepatic impairment and active brain metastases were excluded. 
A total of 126 patients were enrolled and treated with LUMYKRAS 960 mg once daily as 
monotherapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity; 124 patients had at least one 
measurable lesion at baseline as assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) according 
to RECIST v1.1 and were included in the analysis for response-related efficacy outcomes. The median 
duration of treatment was 5.5 months (range: 0 to 15) with 48% of patients treated for ≥ 6 months and 
33% of patients treated for ≥ 9 months. 
The major efficacy outcome measure was objective response rate (ORR) defined as the proportion of 
patients who achieved CR or PR as evaluated by a BICR according to RECIST v1.1. Additional 
efficacy outcome measures included duration of response (DOR), disease control rate (DCR) defined 
as the proportion of patients who achieved CR, PR and stable disease, time to response (TTR), 
progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The baseline demographic and disease characteristics of the study population were: median age 
64 years (range: 37 to 80); 50% Female; 82% White, 15% Asian, 2% Black; 70% ECOG PS 1; 96% 
had stage IV disease; 99% with non-squamous histology; 81% former smokers, 12% current smokers, 
5% never smokers. 
All patients received at least 1 prior line of systemic therapy for metastatic NSCLC; 43% received 
only 1 prior line of therapy, 35% received 2 prior lines of therapy, 22% received 3 prior lines of 
therapy, 91% received prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy, 90% received prior platinum-based 
chemotherapy, 81% received both platinum-based chemotherapy and anti-PD-1/PD-L1. The sites of 
known extra-thoracic metastasis included 48% bone, 21% brain, and 21% liver.

LUMYKRAS in all subsets of the paediatric population in NSCLC (see section 4.2 for information on 
paediatric use). 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
This medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called ‘conditional approval’ scheme. This 
means that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. 
The European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicinal product at least every 
year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Absorption 
Bioavailability of sotorasib has not been investigated in humans. Following an oral, single dose 
administration, sotorasib was absorbed with median time to achieve peak concentration of 1 hour. 
Effect of food 
Following administration of sotorasib with a high-fat, high-calorie meal, there was no effect on Cmax, 
and AUC increased by 38% compared to administration under fasted conditions. Sotorasib can be 
administered with or without food.

Distribution 
The geometric mean apparent volume of distribution after 960 mg PO QD for 8 consecutive days of 
sotorasib was 211 L (determined using noncompartmental analysis). In vivo, plasma protein binding of 
sotorasib was 97.6% and sotorasib bound preferentially to alpha-1-acid glycoprotein in vitro. 
Biotransformation 
The main metabolic pathways of sotorasib were non-enzymatic conjugation and oxidative metabolism. 
In vitro data indicate that sotorasib is metabolised by cytochrome P4502C8, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5, 
and is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Following single oral administration of a radioactive 
sotorasib dose of 720 mg, a cysteine adduct (formed through hydrolysis of a glutathione adduct) and 
an oxidative metabolite resulting from CYP3A-mediated cleavage of the piperazine acrylamide moiety 
were the primary circulating metabolites. Neither of these metabolites were pharmacologically active. 
Elimination 
The geometric mean apparent clearance after 960 mg orally once daily for 8 consecutive days 
of sotorasib was 26.2 L/hour (determined using noncompartmental analysis). The mean half-life is 
5 hours. Steady state was reached within 22 days and remained stable. Sotorasib is primarily 
eliminated in faeces, with approximately 74% of the dose recovered in faeces and 6% (1% unchanged) 
recovered in urine. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Sotorasib exhibited nonlinear pharmacokinetics over a range of single and multiple oral administration 
doses studied between 180 to 960 mg once daily as Cmax and AUC0-24 hour were less than dose 
proportional. The average Cmax and AUC0-24 hour values following multiple doses were similar for all 
dosing regimens from 180 mg orally once daily to 960 mg orally once daily. Exposure to sotorasib 
decreases over time following 960 mg orally once daily dosing regimen until steady state is reached. 
Steady state plasma concentrations were achieved by approximately 3 weeks across the phase 1 and 
phase 2 clinical studies across all sotorasib doses. 
Pharmacokinetics in special populations 
Initial results of a population PK analysis suggests no clinically meaningful differences in the 
pharmacokinetics of sotorasib based on age, sex, race or ethnicity, body weight, line of therapy, 
ECOG PS, serum albumin, mild renal impairment (CrCL ≥ 60 mL/min), or mild hepatic impairment 
(AST or ALT < 2.5 × ULN or total bilirubin < 1.5 × ULN). The effect of moderate to severe renal 
impairment on sotorasib pharmacokinetics has not been studied. 
Hepatic impairment 
Compared to subjects with normal hepatic function after a 960 mg LUMYKRAS administration, the 
mean systemic exposure AUCinf of sotorasib decreased by 25.4% in subjects with moderate 
impairment (Child-Pugh B) and increased by 3.6% in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-
Pugh C). The unbound AUCinf  of sotorasib increased by 1.8-fold in subjects with moderate hepatic 
impairment and by 6-fold in patients with severe hepatic impairment.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Mutagenicity 
Sotorasib was not mutagenic in a bacterial mutagenicity (Ames) assay. Sotorasib was not genotoxic in 
the in vivo rat micronucleus and comet assays. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with sotorasib. 
Reproductive toxicity 
In rat and rabbit embryo-foetal development studies, oral sotorasib was not teratogenic. 
In the rat, there were no effects on embryo-foetal development up to the highest dose tested (3.9 times 
higher than the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 960 mg based on 
area under the curve [AUC]). 
In the rabbit, lower foetal body weights and a reduction in the number of ossified metacarpals in 
foetuses were observed only at the highest dose level tested (2.2 times higher than the exposure at the 
MRHD of 960 mg based on AUC), which was associated with maternal effects such as decreased 
body weight gain and food consumption during the dosing phase. Reduced ossification, as evidence of 
growth retardation associated with reduced foetal body weight, was interpreted as a non-specific effect 
in the presence of significant maternal toxicity. 
Impairment of fertility 
Fertility/early embryonic development studies were not conducted with sotorasib. There were no 
adverse effects on male or female reproductive organs in general toxicology studies conducted in dogs 
and rats. 
Other nonclinical safety data 
Adverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to 
clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows: 
• 
Renal toxicity observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats. 
Environmental risk assessment 
Environmental risk assessment studies have shown that sotorasib has the potential to be very persistent 
to the environment (see section 6.6). There is no potential for bioaccumulation or toxicity.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What LUMYKRAS is and what it is used for  
LUMYKRAS contains the active substance sotorasib and belongs to a group of medicines known as 
antineoplastic agents (cancer medicines). 
LUMYKRAS is used to treat adults with a type of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) when it is advanced and has spread to other parts of the body. 
LUMYKRAS is used when previous treatments were not effective in stopping the growth of the 
cancer, and when the cancer cells have a genetic change that allows them to produce an abnormal form 
of protein called KRAS G12C. Your doctor will test your cancer cells for this change beforehand to 
make sure that LUMYKRAS is right for you. 
How does LUMYKRAS work? 
The abnormal KRAS G12C protein, acts to help make cancer cells grow out of control. LUMYKRAS 
attaches to the protein and stops it from working, which may slow down or stop the growth of the 
cancer. 
If you have any questions about how LUMYKRAS works or why this medicine has been prescribed 
for you, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse. 
2.  What you need to know before you take LUMYKRAS  
Do not take LUMYKRAS 
- 
if you are allergic to sotorasib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before taking LUMYKRAS. 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you have a history of liver problems. Your doctor may carry 
out blood tests to check your liver function, and may decide to either reduce the dose of LUMYKRAS 
or stop your treatment. 
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any other lung problems. Some lung problems may get worse 
during treatment with LUMYKRAS, as LUMYKRAS may cause inflammation of the lungs during 
treatment. Symptoms may be similar to those from lung cancer. Tell your doctor right away if you 
have any new or worsening symptoms including difficulty in breathing, shortness of breath, or cough 
with or without mucous, or fever. 
Children and adolescents 
LUMYKRAS has not been studied in children or adolescents. Treatment with LUMYKRAS is not 
recommended in persons under 18 years of age. 
Other medicines and LUMYKRAS 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription, vitamins and herbal supplements. 
This is because LUMYKRAS can affect the way some other medicines work, and some other 
medicines can affect the way LUMYKRAS works. 
The following medicines may reduce how well LUMYKRAS works: 
• 
Medicines used to reduce stomach acid and to treat stomach ulcers, indigestion and heartburn 
(see section 3) such as: 
- 
 dexlansoprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole sodium, or 
rabeprazole (medicines known as ‘proton pump inhibitors’) 
 ranitidine, famotidine, cimetidine (medicines known as ‘H2 receptor antagonists’) 
- 
Rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis) 
Medicines used to treat epilepsy called phenytoin, phenobarbital or carbamazepine (also used to 
treat nerve pain) 
St. John’s wort (herbal medicine used to treat depression) 
Enzalutamide (used to treat prostate cancer) 
• 
• 
• 
• 
LUMYKRAS may reduce how well the following medicines work: 
• 
• 
Medicines used to treat severe pain, such as alfentanil or fentanyl 
Medicines used in organ transplantation to prevent organ rejection, such as cyclosporine, 
sirolimus, everolimus, or tacrolimus 
Medicines used to reduce cholesterol levels, such as simvastatin, atorvastatin, or lovastatin 
Midazolam (used to treat acute seizures or as a sedative before or during surgery or medical 
procedures) 
Medicines used to treat heart rhythm problems, such as dronedarone or amiodarone 
Medicines known as anticoagulants that stop your blood clotting, such as rivaroxaban or 
apixaban 
• 
• 
• 
• 
LUMYKRAS may increase the risk for side effects with the following medicines:  
• 
Medicines used to treat certain cancers or inflammatory conditions, such as methotrexate, 
mitoxantrone, topotecan or lapatinib 
Medicines used to treat heart failure, such as digoxin 
Medicines used to lower cholesterol, such as rosuvastatin 
• 
• 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Contraception 
If you take LUMYKRAS whilst using oral contraceptives, the oral contraceptives may be ineffective. 
In addition, you should use another reliable method of birth control such as a barrier method (e.g. 
condom) so you do not become pregnant while you are taking this medicine. Talk to your doctor about 
the right methods of contraception for you and your partner. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
Pregnancy  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. 
You should not become pregnant while taking this medicine because the effects of LUMYKRAS in 
pregnant women are not known, it could harm the baby. If you are able to become pregnant, you must 
use highly effective contraception while on treatment and for at least 7 days after stopping treatment. 
Breast-feeding 
Do not breast-feed while taking this medicine and for 7 days after the last dose. This is because it is 
not known whether the ingredients in LUMYKRAS pass into breast milk and could therefore harm 
your baby. 
Driving and using machines 
LUMYKRAS has no marked influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
LUMYKRAS contains lactose 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine. 
LUMYKRAS contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium- 
free’. 
3. 
How to take LUMYKRAS  
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Do not change your dose or stop taking LUMYKRAS unless your doctor or pharmacist tells you to. 
Your doctor or pharmacist may decrease the dose or stop your medicine depending on how well you 
tolerate it. 
• 
The recommended dose is eight tablets (960 mg) once a day. Take your daily dose of 
LUMYKRAS by mouth once a day, at the same time each day. 
LUMYKRAS can be taken with or without food.

the tablets. 
If you cannot swallow LUMYKRAS tablets whole: 
-

Swirl gently until the tablets are in small pieces (the tablets will not dissolve completely). 
The appearance of the mixture may range from pale to bright yellow. 
 Drink the mixture right away. 
Rinse the glass with an additional half a glass of water and drink right away to make sure 
that you have taken the full dose of LUMYKRAS. 
 If you do not drink all of the mixture immediately, stir the mixture again before you finish 
drinking it. Drink all of the mixture within two hours of preparation. 
• 
If necessary, your doctor may recommend you receive LUMYKRAS through a feeding tube. 
If you need to take a medicine to reduce stomach acid such as a proton pump inhibitor or an H2 
receptor antagonist, take LUMYKRAS with an acidic beverage (such as cola) . Alternatively, you may 
use a local antacid (such as magnesium hydroxide or calcium carbonate) and, in that case, 
LUMYKRAS should be taken either 4 hours before or 10 hours after that medicine (see section 2). 
If you take more LUMYKRAS than you should 
Contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you take more tablets than recommended. 
If you vomit after taking LUMYKRAS 
If you vomit after taking a dose of LUMYKRAS, do not take an extra dose. Take your next dose at 
your regular scheduled time. 
If you forget to take LUMYKRAS 
If you forget to take a dose of LUMYKRAS at your regular scheduled time, and less than 6 hours have 
passed, take your dose as normal. If more than 6 hours have passed from your regular scheduled time, 
do not take the dose. Take your next dose at your regular scheduled time the next day.

PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
Summary of risk management plan for Evenity® 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Evenity. The RMP details important 
risks of Evenity, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will be obtained 
about Evenity's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Evenity's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its patient information leaflet (PIL) 
give essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Evenity should be 
used.  
This summary of the RMP for Evenity should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Evenity's 
RMP. 
THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR 
1 
Evenity is authorised for the treatment of severe osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high 
risk of fracture (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains romosozumab as the active 
substance and it is given by subcutaneous injection. 
Further information about the evaluation of Evenity’s benefits can be found in Evenity’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s 
webpage: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/evenity.

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND 
ACTIVITIES TO MINIMIZE OR FURTHER CHARACTERISE 
THE RISKS 
Important risks of Evenity, together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Evenity's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products include: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In the case of Evenity, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
 
 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including periodic safety update report (PSUR) assessment, so that 
immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Evenity is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below.  
2.1 
List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Evenity are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Evenity. Potential risks are concerns for which 
an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

Additional 
pharmacovigilance 
activities 
Data to evaluate safety concerns derive from clinical studies, and 
pharmacoepidemiological background prevalence rates.  
This risk has been detected based on an imbalance of myocardial infarction 
and stroke events between romosozumab and alendronate in 1 of the 2 pivotal 
fracture studies, the alendronate-controlled study, 20110142 in women. The 
imbalance resulted from small differences in terms of absolute subject 
numbers and absolute risk differences. No imbalance of cardiovascular events 
was observed in the larger placebo-controlled fracture study 20070337 in 
women. 
In study 20110174 in men, the differences in incidence of serious cardiac 
ischemic events and cerebrovascular events reported between the 
romosozumab group and placebo were less apparent; the absolute number of 
events was small. 
No evidence of any mechanistic association between sclerostin inhibition and 
atheroprogression or MACE-1 events was established based on the totality of 
nonclinical evidence including 2 recent studies evidence.  
The romozosumab osteoporosis development program was conducted in an 
older subject population who are likely to have a higher incidence of pre-
existing cardiovascular conditions and, thus, a higher incidence of 
cardiovascular toxicities than that of the general population. Risk factors for 
atherosclerosis include age, sex, ethnicity, family history, elevated lipid levels, 
cigarette smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and concomitant medications, 
including anthracyclines, antipsychotic agents, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs and cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors. Patients with a history of myocardial 
infarction or stroke have highest absolute risk of major adverse cardiac events.

be associated with atypical femoral fracture. Atypical femoral fractures have 
also been reported in patients with certain comorbid conditions (eg, vitamin D 
deficiency, rheumatoid arthritis, and hypophosphatasia) and with use of 
bisphosphonates, glucocorticoids, and proton pump inhibitors.

Additional 
pharmacovigilance 
activities 
The romozosumab osteoporosis development program was conducted in an 
older subject population who is more affected by serious infections and with 
more severe consequences than the general population. Such infections 
typically include pneumonia, influenza, tuberculosis, bacteremia, nosocomial 
infection, urinary tract infection, salmonellosis and hepatitis. Risk factors for 
serious infections include impaired immune function, anatomic and functional 
changes such as pulmonary hypoventilation, bronchopulmonary aspiration, 
immobility and urinary retention, comorbidities such as diabetes and 
malignancy and institutionalization (in hospitals, or nursing homes). 
Routine risk minimization measures: Treatment should be initiated and 
supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the management of 
osteoporosis - SmPC Section 4.2 (Posology and method of administration). 
Additional risk minimization measures: None

Risk minimization 
measures 
Data to evaluate safety concerns derived from clinical studies and 
postmarketing cases. 
This risk was detected in the postmarketing setting (review of case reports 
within Eudravigilance and signal detection based on disproportionality) 
There is insufficient evidence to date to establish a causal relationship between 
the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmia and the use of romosozumab. 
However, while cofounding factors were reported in most of the cases which 
precluded an assessment of a causal relationship, some events were reported 
with a close temporal relationship. Furthermore; while an imbalance of MACE 
was observed within the pivotal Phase III study (Study 20110142), the precise 
etiology has yet to be elucidated and may be related to cardiac arrhythmia. 
Thus, the risk of cardiac arrhythmia will be considered as an important 
potential risk. 
An analysis of real-world data in the USA, as per the first interim report of the 
FDA postmarketing requirement, revealed that a greater proportion of women 
with PMO exposed to romosozumab compared to other osteoporosis 
medications were older had important comorbidities (eg, COPD, diabetes, 
hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and smoking habits) and pre-existing 
arrhythmia. These constitute strong predisposing risk factors for the risk of 
cardiac arrhythmia among romosozumab users.

Recommendations for evaluation of the individual benefit-risk balance is 
included in SmPC Section 4.4- (Special warnings and precautions for use).

Study short name and title: 
European non-interventional post-authorization safety study related to adherence to the risk 
minimization measures for romosozumab by the EU-ADR Alliance. 
Purpose of the study:  
Adherence to the risk minimization measures in the product information is planned to be studied 
by estimating the compliance with contraindications and target indication amongst incident 
romosozumab users and analyzing the utilization patterns. 
2.3.2.2 
European non-interventional post-authorization safety study related 
to serious cardiovascular events of myocardial infarction and stroke, 
and all-cause mortality for romosozumab by the EU-ADR Alliance 
Study short name and title:  
European non-interventional post-authorization safety study related to serious cardiovascular 
events of myocardial infarction and stroke and all-cause mortality for romosozumab by the EU-
ADR Alliance.  
 
 
Purpose of the study:  
Serious cardiovascular events of myocardial infarction and stroke are considered an important 
identified risk and cardiac arrhythmias are considered an important potential risk for 
romosozumab.  
The objective of the non-interventional post-authorization safety study is to characterize the 
serious cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, all-cause, cardiovascular death and 
cardiac arrhythmias) in romosozumab users and in comparable patients receiving alternative 
osteoporosis medications. Events in scope were identified with previously validated algorithms 
by the EU-ADR Alliance members.

European non-interventional post-authorization safety study related 
to serious infections for romosozumab by the EU-ADR Alliance 
Study short name and title:  
European non-interventional post-authorization safety study related to serious infections for 
romosozumab by the EU-ADR Alliance. 
Purpose of the study:  
Serious infections are considered an important potential risk for romosozumab. To date no 
definitive determination of causality has been established. 
The objective of the non-interventional post-authorization safety study is to characterize the 
serious infections in new romosozumab users and in comparable patients receiving alternative 
osteoporosis medications. Events in scope were specified using preparational validation studies 
to make sure the identification of the outcomes are accurate due to the absence of validated 
algorithms across the EU-ADR Alliance.

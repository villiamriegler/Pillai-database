1. 
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
Enhertu 100 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion 
2. 
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 
One vial of powder for concentrate for solution for infusion contains 100 mg of trastuzumab 
deruxtecan. After reconstitution, one vial of 5 mL solution contains 20 mg/mL of trastuzumab 
deruxtecan (see section 6.6). 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that contains a humanised anti-
HER2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) with the same amino acid sequence as trastuzumab, 
produced by mammalian (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells, covalently linked to DXd, an exatecan 
derivative and a topoisomerase I inhibitor, via a tetrapeptide-based cleavable linker. Approximately 
8 molecules of deruxtecan are attached to each antibody molecule. 
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

Gastric cancer  
Enhertu as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced HER2-positive 
gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab-
based regimen. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Enhertu should be prescribed by a physician and administered under the supervision of a healthcare 
professional experienced in the use of anticancer medicinal products. In order to prevent medicinal 
product errors, it is important to check the vial labels to ensure that the medicinal product being 
prepared and administered is Enhertu (trastuzumab deruxtecan) and not trastuzumab or trastuzumab 
emtansine. 
Enhertu should not be substituted with trastuzumab or trastuzumab emtansine. 
Patient selection 
HER2-positive breast cancer 
Patients treated with trastuzumab deruxtecan for breast cancer should have documented HER2-
positive tumour status, defined as a score of 3 + by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or a ratio of ≥ 2.0 by 
in situ hybridization (ISH) or by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assessed by a CE-marked in 
vitro diagnostic (IVD) medical device. If a CE-marked IVD is not available, the HER2 status should 
be assessed by an alternate validated test. 
HER2-low breast cancer 
Patients treated with trastuzumab deruxtecan should have documented HER2-low tumour status, 
defined as a score of IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-, as assessed by a CE-marked IVD medical device. If a 
CE-marked IVD is not available, the HER2 status should be assessed by an alternate validated test 
(see section 5.1). 
NSCLC 
Patients treated with trastuzumab deruxtecan for advanced NSCLC should have an activating HER2 
(ERBB2) mutation detected by a CE-marked in vitro diagnostic (IVD) medical device. If a CE-marked 
IVD is not available, the HER2 mutation status should be assessed by an alternate validated test. 
Gastric cancer 
Patients treated with trastuzumab deruxtecan for gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer should 
have documented HER2-positive tumour status, defined as a score of 3 + by immunohistochemistry 
(IHC) or a ratio of ≥ 2 by in situ hybridization (ISH) or by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), 
assessed by a CE-marked in vitro diagnostic (IVD) medical device. If a CE-marked IVD is not 
available, the HER2 status should be assessed by an alternate validated test. 
Posology 
Breast cancer 
The recommended dose of Enhertu is 5.4 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion once every 3 weeks 
(21-day cycle) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
NSCLC 
The recommended dose of Enhertu is 5.4 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion once every 3 weeks 
(21-day cycle) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
Gastric cancer 
The recommended dose of Enhertu is 6.4 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion once every 3 weeks 
(21-day cycle) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The initial dose should be administered as a 90-minute intravenous infusion. If the prior infusion was 
well tolerated, subsequent doses of Enhertu may be administered as 30-minute infusions. 
The infusion rate of Enhertu should be slowed or interrupted if the patient develops infusion-related 
symptoms (see section 4.8). Enhertu should be permanently discontinued in case of severe infusion 
reactions. 
Premedication 
Enhertu is emetogenic (see section 4.8), which includes delayed nausea and/or vomiting. Prior to each 
dose of Enhertu, patients should be premedicated with a combination regimen of two or three 
medicinal products (e.g., dexamethasone with either a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist and/or an NK1 
receptor antagonist, as well as other medicinal products as indicated) for prevention of chemotherapy-
induced nausea and vomiting. 
Dose modifications 
Management of adverse reactions may require temporary interruption, dose reduction, or treatment 
discontinuation of Enhertu per guidelines provided in Tables 1 and 2. 
Enhertu dose should not be re-escalated after a dose reduction is made.

Adverse Events Version 5.0 (NCI-CTCAE v.5.0). 
Delayed or missed dose 
If a planned dose is delayed or missed, it should be administered as soon as possible without waiting 
until the next planned cycle. The schedule of administration should be adjusted to maintain a 3-week 
interval between doses. The infusion should be administered at the dose and rate the patient tolerated 
in the most recent infusion. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment of Enhertu is required in patients aged 65 years or older. Limited data are 
available in patients ≥ 75 years of age. 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild (creatinine clearance [CLcr] ≥ 60 and 
< 90 mL/min) or moderate (CLcr ≥ 30 and < 60 mL/min) renal impairment (see section 5.2). The 
potential need for dose adjustment in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease 
cannot be determined as severe renal impairment was an exclusion criterion in clinical studies. A 
higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis leading to an increase in discontinuation of 
therapy has been observed in patients with moderate renal impairment. In patients with moderate renal 
impairment at baseline who received Enhertu 6.4 mg/kg, a higher incidence of serious adverse 
reactions was observed compared to those with normal renal function. Patients with moderate or 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
severe renal impairment should be monitored carefully for adverse reactions including 
ILD/pneumonitis (see section 4.4). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal 
(ULN), irrespective of aspartate transaminase (AST) value. The potential need for dose adjustment in 
patients with total bilirubin > 1.5 times ULN, irrespective of AST value, cannot be determined due to 
limited data; therefore, these patients should be monitored carefully (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Enhertu in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years have not 
been established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Enhertu is for intravenous use. It must be reconstituted and diluted by a healthcare professional and 
administered as an intravenous infusion. Enhertu must not be administered as an intravenous push or 
bolus. 
For instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see 
section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
In order to prevent medicinal product errors, it is important to check the vial labels to ensure that the 
medicinal product being prepared and administered is Enhertu (trastuzumab deruxtecan) and not 
trastuzumab or trastuzumab emtansine. 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis 
Cases of interstitial lung disease (ILD), and/or pneumonitis, have been reported with Enhertu (see 
section 4.8). Fatal outcomes have been observed. Patients should be advised to immediately report 
cough, dyspnoea, fever and/or any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Patients should be 
monitored for signs and symptoms of ILD/pneumonitis. Evidence of ILD/pneumonitis should be 
promptly investigated. Patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis should be evaluated by radiographic 
imaging, preferably a computed tomography (CT) scan. Consultation with a pulmonologist should be 
considered. For asymptomatic (Grade 1) ILD/pneumonitis, consider corticosteroid treatment (e.g., 
≥ 0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). Enhertu should be withheld until recovery to Grade 0 
and may be resumed according to instructions in Table 2 (see section 4.2). For symptomatic 
ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), promptly initiate corticosteroid treatment (e.g., ≥ 1 mg/kg/day 
prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 days followed by gradual taper for at least 
4 weeks. Enhertu should be permanently discontinued in patients who are diagnosed with symptomatic 
(Grade 2 or greater) ILD/pneumonitis (see section 4.2). Patients with a history of ILD/pneumonitis or 
patients with moderate or severe renal impairment may be at increased risk of developing 
ILD/pneumonitis and should be monitored carefully (see section 4.2).

Neutropenia 
Cases of neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia with a fatal outcome, were reported in clinical 
studies of Enhertu. Complete blood counts should be monitored prior to initiation of Enhertu and prior 
to each dose, and as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of neutropenia, Enhertu may require 
dose interruption or reduction (see section 4.2). 
Left ventricular ejection fraction decrease 
Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies.  
Standard cardiac function testing (echocardiogram or MUGA [multigated acquisition] scanning) 
should be performed to assess LVEF prior to initiation of Enhertu and at regular intervals during 
treatment as clinically indicated. LVEF decrease should be managed through treatment interruption. 
Enhertu should be permanently discontinued if LVEF of less than 40% or absolute decrease from 
baseline of greater than 20% is confirmed. Enhertu should be permanently discontinued in patients 
with symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF) (see Table 2 in section 4.2). 
Embryo-foetal toxicity 
Enhertu can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In post-marketing reports, use 
of trastuzumab, a HER2 receptor antagonist, during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios 
manifesting as fatal pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities and neonatal death. Based on 
findings in animals and its mechanism of action, the topoisomerase I inhibitor component of Enhertu, 
DXd, can also cause embryo-foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman (see section 4.6). 
The pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential should be verified prior to the initiation of 
Enhertu. The patient should be informed of the potential risks to the foetus. Females of reproductive 
potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 7 months 
following the last dose of Enhertu. Male patients with female partners of reproductive potential should 
be advised to use effective contraception during treatment with Enhertu and for at least 4 months after 
the last dose of Enhertu (see section 4.6). 
Patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment 
There are limited data in patients with moderate hepatic impairment and no data in patients with 
severe hepatic impairment. As metabolism and biliary excretion are the primary routes of elimination 
of the topoisomerase I inhibitor, DXd, Enhertu should be administered with caution in patients with 
moderate and severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Co-administration with ritonavir, an inhibitor of OATP1B, CYP3A and P-gp, or with itraconazole, a 
strong inhibitor of CYP3A and P-gp, resulted in no clinically meaningful (approximately 10-20%) 
increase in exposures of trastuzumab deruxtecan or the released topoisomerase I inhibitor, DXd. No 
dose adjustment is required during co-administration of trastuzumab deruxtecan with medicinal 
products that are inhibitors of CYP3A or OATP1B or P-gp transporters (see section 5.2). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females 
Pregnancy status of women of childbearing potential should be verified prior to initiation of Enhertu. 
Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment with Enhertu and 
for at least 7 months following the last dose. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Men with female partners of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment 
with Enhertu and for at least 4 months following the last dose. 
Pregnancy 
There is no available data on the use of Enhertu in pregnant women. However, trastuzumab, a 
HER2 receptor antagonist, can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In post-
marketing reports, use of trastuzumab during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios in some 
cases manifested as fatal pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities and neonatal death. Based on 
findings in animals and its mechanism of action, the topoisomerase I inhibitor component of Enhertu, 
DXd, can be expected to cause embryo-foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman (see 
section 5.3). 
Administration of Enhertu to pregnant women is not recommended, and patients should be informed 
of the potential risks to the foetus before they become pregnant. Women who become pregnant must 
immediately contact their doctor. If a woman becomes pregnant during treatment with Enhertu or 
within 7 months following the last dose of Enhertu, close monitoring is recommended. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known if trastuzumab deruxtecan is excreted in human milk. Human IgG is secreted in human 
milk, and the potential for absorption and serious adverse reactions to the infant is unknown. 
Therefore, women should not breast-feed during treatment with Enhertu or for 7 months after the last 
dose. A decision should be made to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue treatment taking into 
account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and/or benefit of treatment with Enhertu for the 
mother. 
Fertility 
No dedicated fertility studies have been conducted with trastuzumab deruxtecan. Based on results 
from animal toxicity studies, Enhertu may impair male reproductive function and fertility. It is not 
known whether trastuzumab deruxtecan or its metabolites are found in seminal fluid. Before starting 
treatment, male patients should be advised to seek counselling on sperm storage. Male patients must 
not freeze or donate sperm throughout the treatment period, and for at least 4 months after the final 
dose of Enhertu. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Enhertu may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be 
advised to use caution when driving or operating machinery in case they experience fatigue, headache 
or dizziness during treatment with Enhertu (see section 4.8).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis 
In patients treated with Enhertu 5.4 mg/kg in clinical studies across multiple tumour types (n = 1449), 
ILD occurred in 12.5% of patients. Most ILD cases were Grade 1 (3.2%) and Grade 2 (7.4%). Grade 3 
cases occurred in 0.8% and no Grade 4 cases occurred. Grade 5 (fatal) events occurred in 1.0% of 
patients. Median time to first onset was 5.5 months (range: 26 days to 31.5 months) (see sections 4.2 
and 4.4). 
In patients treated with Enhertu 6.4 mg/kg in clinical studies across multiple tumour types (n = 669), 
ILD occurred in 17.9% of patients. Most ILD cases were Grade 1 (4.9%) and Grade 2 (9.4%). Grade 3 
cases occurred in 1.3% and Grade 4 cases occurred in 0.1% of patients. Grade 5 (fatal) events occurred 
in 2.1% of patients. One patient had pre-existing ILD that worsened post treatment leading to Grade 5 
(fatal) ILD. Median time to first onset was 4.2 months (range: -0.5 to 21.0) (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Neutropenia 
In patients treated with Enhertu 5.4 mg/kg in clinical studies (n = 1449) across multiple tumour types, 
neutropenia was reported in 35.2% of patients and 17.0% had Grade 3 or 4 events. Median time of 
onset was 43 days (range: 1 day to 31.9 months), and median duration of the first event was 22 days 
(range: 1 day to 17.1 months). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 0.9% of patients and 0.1% were 
Grade 5 (see section 4.2). 
In patients treated with Enhertu 6.4 mg/kg in clinical studies across multiple tumour types (n = 669), 
neutropenia was reported in 43.5% of patients and 28.7% had Grade 3 or 4 events. Median time of 
onset was 16 days (range: 1 day to 24.8 months), and median duration of the first event was 9 days 
(range: 2 days to 17.2 months). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 3.0% of patients and 0.1% were 
Grade 5 (see section 4.2). 
Left ventricular ejection fraction decrease 
In patients treated with Enhertu 5.4 mg/kg in clinical studies across multiple tumour types (n = 1449), 
LVEF decrease was reported in 57 patients (3.9%), of which 10 (0.7%) were Grade 1, 40 (2.8%) were 
Grade 2 and 7 (0.5%) were Grade 3. The observed frequency of LVEF decreased based on laboratory 
parameters (echocardiogram or MUGA scanning) was 202/1341 (15.1%) for Grade 2 and 
12/1341 (0.9%) for Grade 3. Treatment with Enhertu has not been studied in patients with LVEF less 
than 50% prior to initiation of treatment (see section 4.2). 
In patients treated with Enhertu 6.4 mg/kg in clinical studies across multiple tumour types (n = 669), 
LVEF decrease was reported in 12 patients (1.8%), of which 1 (0.1%) was Grade 1, 8 (1.2%) were 
Grade 2, and 3 (0.4%) were Grade 3. The observed frequency of LVEF decreased based on laboratory 
parameters (echocardiogram or MUGA scanning) was 89/597 (14.9%) for Grade 2, and 8/597 (1.3%) 
for Grade 3. 
Infusion-related reactions 
In patients treated with Enhertu 5.4 mg/kg in clinical studies (n = 1449) across multiple tumour types, 
infusion-related reactions were reported in 18 patients (1.2%), all of which were Grade 1 or Grade 2 
severity. No Grade 3 events were reported. Three events (0.2%) of infusion-related reactions led to 
dose interruptions, and no events led to discontinuation.

In patients treated with Enhertu 6.4 mg/kg in clinical studies (n = 669) across multiple tumour types, 
infusion-related reactions were reported in 7 patients (1.0%), all of which were Grade 1 or Grade 2 
severity. No Grade 3 events were reported. One event (0.1%) of infusion-related reaction led to dose 
interruption, and no events led to discontinuation. 
Immunogenicity 
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. Across all doses evaluated in 
clinical studies, 2.1% (47/2213) of evaluable patients developed antibodies against trastuzumab 
deruxtecan following treatment with Enhertu. The incidence of treatment-emergent neutralising 
antibodies against trastuzumab deruxtecan was 0.1% (2/2213). There was no association between 
development of antibodies and allergic-type reactions. 
Paediatric population 
Safety has not been established in this population. 
Elderly 
In patients treated with Enhertu 5.4 mg/kg in clinical studies across multiple tumour types (n = 1449), 
24.2% were 65 years or older and 4.3% were 75 years or older. There was a higher incidence of 
Grade 3-4 adverse reactions observed in patients aged 65 years or older (50.0%) as compared to 
patients younger than 65 years old (42.7%), leading to more discontinuations due to adverse reactions. 
Of the 669 patients across multiple tumour types in clinical studies treated with Enhertu 6.4 mg/kg, 
39.2% were 65 years or older and 7.6% were 75 years or older. The incidence of Grade 3-4 adverse 
reactions observed in patients 65 years or older was 59.9% and 62.9% in younger patients. There was 
a higher incidence of Grade 3-4 adverse reactions observed in patients 75 years of age or older 
(64.7%) compared to patients less than 75 years of age (61.5%). In patients 75 years or older, there 
was a higher incidence of serious adverse reactions (37.3%) and fatal events (7.8%) compared to 
patients less than 75 years (20.7% and 2.3%). Data are limited to establish the safety in patients 
75 years or older. 
Ethnic differences 
In clinical studies, no relevant differences in exposure or efficacy were observed between patients of 
different ethnic groups. Asian patients receiving Enhertu 6.4 mg/kg had a higher incidence (≥ 10% 
difference) of neutropenia (58.1% vs. 18.6%), anaemia (51.1% vs. 32.4%), leukopenia (42.7% vs. 
6.9%), thrombocytopenia (40.5% vs. 15.4%) and lymphopenia (17.6% vs. 7.3%) compared to non-
Asian patients. In Asian patients, 4.3% experienced a bleeding event within 14 days after onset of 
thrombocytopenia compared to 1.6% of non-Asian patients. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
The maximum tolerated dose of trastuzumab deruxtecan has not been determined. In clinical studies, 
single doses higher than 8.0 mg/kg have not been tested. In case of overdose, patients must be closely 
monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment 
initiated.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor 
Receptor 2) inhibitors, ATC code: L01FD04 
Mechanism of action 
Enhertu, trastuzumab deruxtecan, is a HER2-targeted antibody-drug conjugate. The antibody is a 
humanised anti-HER2 IgG1 attached to deruxtecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor (DXd) bound by a 
tetrapeptide-based cleavable linker. The antibody-drug conjugate is stable in plasma. The function of 
the antibody portion is to bind to HER2 expressed on the surface of certain tumour cells. After 
binding, the trastuzumab deruxtecan complex then undergoes internalisation and intracellular linker 
cleavage by lysosomal enzymes that are upregulated in cancer cells. Upon release, the membrane-
permeable DXd causes DNA damage and apoptotic cell death. DXd, an exatecan derivative, is 
approximately 10 times more potent than SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan. 
In vitro studies indicate that the antibody portion of trastuzumab deruxtecan, which has the same 
amino acid sequence as trastuzumab, also binds to FcγRIIIa and complement C1q. The antibody 
mediates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in human breast cancer cells that 
overexpress HER2. In addition, the antibody inhibits signalling through the phosphatidylinositol 3-
kinase (PI3-K) pathway in human breast cancer cells that overexpress HER2. 
Clinical efficacy 
HER2-positive breast cancer 
DESTINY-Breast03 (NCT03529110) 
The efficacy and safety of Enhertu were studied in DESTINY-Breast03, a multicentre, open-label, 
active-controlled, randomised, two-arm phase 3 study that enrolled patients with HER2-positive, 
unresectable or metastatic breast cancer who received prior trastuzumab and taxane therapy for 
metastatic disease or developed disease recurrence during or within 6 months of completing adjuvant 
therapy. 
Archival breast tumour samples were required to show HER2 positivity defined as HER2 IHC 3+ or 
ISH-positive. The study excluded patients with a history of ILD/pneumonitis requiring treatment with 
steroids or ILD/pneumonitis at screening, patients with untreated and symptomatic brain metastases, 
patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease and patients with prior treatment with an 
anti-HER2 antibody-drug conjugate in the metastatic setting. Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive 
either Enhertu 5.4 mg/kg (N = 261) or trastuzumab emtansine 3.6 mg/kg (N = 263) administered by 
intravenous infusion once every three weeks. Randomisation was stratified by hormone receptor 
status, prior treatment with pertuzumab, and history of visceral disease. Treatment was administered 
until disease progression, death, withdrawal of consent, or unacceptable toxicity. 
The primary efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) as evaluated by blinded 
independent central review (BICR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours 
(RECIST v1.1). Overall survival (OS) was a key secondary efficacy outcome measure. PFS based on 
investigator assessment, confirmed objective response rate (ORR), and duration of response (DOR) 
were secondary endpoints. 
Patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced between treatment arms. Of 
the 524 patients randomised, the baseline demographic and disease characteristics were: median age 
54 years (range: 20 to 83); 65 years or older (20.2%); female (99.6%); Asian (59.9%), White (27.3%), 
Black or African American (3.6%); Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance 
status 0 (62.8%) or 1 (36.8%); hormone receptor status (positive: 51.9%); presence of visceral disease 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(73.3%); presence of brain metastases at baseline (15.6%); and 48.3% of patients received one line of 
prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting. The percentage of patients who had not received prior 
treatment for metastatic disease was 9.5%. The percentage of patients who were previously treated 
with pertuzumab was 61.1%. 
At the prespecified interim analysis for PFS based on 245 events (73% of total events planned for final 
analysis), the study showed a statistically significant improvement in PFS per BICR in patients 
randomised to Enhertu compared to trastuzumab emtansine. PFS by BICR data from the primary 
analysis (data cutoff 21 May 2021) and updated OS, ORR and DOR results from data cutoff 25 July 
2022 are presented in Table 4.

DESTINY-Breast02 (NCT03523585) 
The efficacy and safety of Enhertu were evaluated in study DESTINY-Breast02, a Phase 3, 
randomised, multicentre, open-label, active-controlled study that enrolled patients with unresectable or 
metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, who were resistant or refractory to prior T-DM1 therapy. 
Archival breast tumour samples were required to show HER2 positivity defined as HER2 IHC 3+ or 
ISH-positive. The study excluded patients with a history of ILD/pneumonitis requiring treatment with 
steroids or ILD/pneumonitis at screening, patients with untreated and symptomatic brain metastases 
and patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease. Patients were randomised 2:1 to 
receive either Enhertu 5.4 mg/kg (n = 406) by intravenous infusion every three weeks, or treatment of 
physician’s choice (n = 202, trastuzumab plus capecitabine or lapatinib plus capecitabine). 
Randomisation was stratified by hormone receptor status, prior treatment with pertuzumab and history 
of visceral disease. Treatment was administered until disease progression, death, withdrawal of 
consent or unacceptable toxicity. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The primary efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by blinded 
independent central review (BICR) based on RECIST v1.1. Overall survival (OS) was a key secondary 
efficacy outcome measure. PFS based on investigator assessment, confirmed objective response rate 
(ORR) and duration of response (DOR) were secondary objectives. 
Demographic and baseline disease characteristics were similar between treatment arms. Of the 608 
patients randomised, the median age was 54 years (range 22 to 88); female (99.2%); White (63.2%), 
Asian (29.3%), Black or African American (2.8%); Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
performance status 0 (57.4%) or 1 (42.4%); hormone receptor status (positive: 58.6%); presence of 
visceral disease (78.3%); presence of brain metastases at baseline (18.1%) and 4.9% of patients 
received one line of prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting.

DESTINY-Breast01 (NCT03248492) 
The efficacy and safety of Enhertu were studied in DESTINY-Breast01, a multicentre, open-label, 
single-arm Phase 2 study that enrolled patients with HER2-positive, unresectable and/or metastatic 
breast cancer who had received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens, including trastuzumab 
emtansine (100%), trastuzumab (100%) and pertuzumab (65.8%). Archival breast tumour samples 
were required to show HER2 positivity defined as HER2 IHC 3+ or ISH-positive. The study excluded 
patients with a history of treated ILD or ILD at screening, patients with untreated or symptomatic 
brain metastases, and patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease. Patients enrolled 
had at least 1 measurable lesion per RECIST v1.1. Enhertu was administered by intravenous infusion 
at 5.4 mg/kg once every three weeks until disease progression, death, withdrawal of consent, or 
unacceptable toxicity. The primary efficacy outcome measure was confirmed objective response rate 
(ORR) according to RECIST v1.1 in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population as evaluated by independent 
central review (ICR). The secondary efficacy outcome measure was duration of response (DOR). 
Of the 184 patients enrolled in DESTINY-Breast01, baseline demographic and disease characteristics 
were: median age 55 years (range: 28 to 96); 65 years or older (23.9%); female (100%); White 
(54.9%), Asian (38.0%), Black or African American (2.2%); Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
(ECOG) performance status 0 (55.4%) or 1 (44.0%); hormone receptor status (positive: 52.7%);

presence of visceral disease (91.8%); previously treated and stable brain metastases (13.0%); median 
number of prior therapies in the metastatic setting: 5 (range: 2 to 17); sum of diameters of target 
lesions (< 5 cm: 42.4%, ≥ 5 cm: 50.0%). 
An earlier analysis (median duration of follow-up 11.1 months [range: 0.7 to 19.9 months]) showed a 
confirmed objective response rate of 60.9% (95% CI: 53.4, 68.0) with 6.0% being complete 
responders and 54.9% being partial responders; 36.4% had stable disease, 1.6% had progressive 
disease and 1.1% were not evaluable. Median duration of response at that time was 14.8 months 
(95% CI: 13.8, 16.9) with 81.3% of responders having a response of ≥ 6 months (95% CI: 71.9, 87.8). 
Efficacy results from an updated data cutoff with median duration of follow-up of 20.5 months (range: 
0.7 to 31.4 months) are shown in Table 6.

HER2-low breast cancer 
DESTINY-Breast04 (NCT03734029) 
The efficacy and safety of Enhertu were studied in DESTINY-Breast04, a phase 3, randomised, 
multicentre, open-label study that enrolled 557 adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-
low breast cancer. The study included 2 cohorts: 494 hormone receptor positive (HR+) patients and 
63 hormone receptor negative (HR-) patients. HER2-low expression was defined as IHC 1+ (defined 
as faint, partial staining of the membrane in greater than 10% of the cancer cells) or IHC 2+/ISH-, as 
determined by the PATHWAY/VENTANA anti-HER2/neu (4B5) evaluated at a central laboratory. 
Patients must have received chemotherapy in the metastatic setting or have developed disease 
recurrence during or within 6 months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy. According to the 
inclusion criteria, patients who were HR+ must have received at least one endocrine therapy and be 
ineligible for further endocrine therapy at the time of randomisation. Patients were randomised 2:1 to 
receive either Enhertu 5.4 mg/kg (N = 373) by intravenous infusion every three weeks or physician’s 
choice of chemotherapy (N = 184, eribulin 51.1%, capecitabine 20.1%, gemcitabine 10.3%, nab 
paclitaxel 10.3%, or paclitaxel 8.2%). Randomisation was stratified by HER2 IHC status of tumour 
samples (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-), number of prior lines of chemotherapy in the metastatic setting (1 
or 2) and HR status/prior CDK4/6i treatment (HR+ with prior CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment, HR+ 
without prior CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment, or HR-). Treatment was administered until disease

progression, death, withdrawal of consent, or unacceptable toxicity. The study excluded patients with 
a history of ILD/pneumonitis requiring treatment with steroids or ILD/pneumonitis at screening and 
clinically significant cardiac disease. Patients were also excluded for untreated or symptomatic brain 
metastases or ECOG performance status > 1. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with HR+ breast cancer 
assessed by BICR based on RECIST v1.1. Key secondary efficacy endpoints were PFS assessed by 
BICR based on RECIST v1.1 in the overall population (all randomised HR+ and HR- patients), overall 
survival (OS) in HR+ patients and OS in the overall population. ORR, DOR and patient-reported 
outcomes (PROs) were secondary endpoints. 
Demographics and baseline tumour characteristics were similar between treatment arms. Of the 
557 patients randomised, the median age was 57 years (range: 28 to 81); 23.5% were age 65 or older; 
99.6% were female and 0.4% were male; 47.9% were White, 40.0% were Asian and 1.8% were Black 
or African American. Patients had an ECOG performance status of 0 (54.8%) or 1 (45.2%) at baseline; 
57.6% were IHC 1+, 42.4% were IHC 2+/ISH-; 88.7% were HR+ and 11.3% HR-; 69.8% had liver 
metastases, 32.9% had lung metastases, and 5.7% had brain metastases. The percentage of patients 
who had prior anthracycline use in the (neo)adjuvant setting was 46.3% and 19.4% in the locally 
advanced and/or metastatic setting. In the metastatic setting, patients had a median of 3 prior lines of 
systemic therapy (range: 1 to 9) with 57.6% having 1 and 40.9% having 2 prior chemotherapy 
regimens; 3.9% were early progressors (progression in the neo/adjuvant setting). In HR+ patients, the 
median number of prior lines of endocrine therapy was 2 (range: 0 to 9) and 70% had prior CDK4/6 
inhibitor treatment.

*Based on data from electronic case report form for the HR+ cohort: N = 333 for Enhertu arm and N = 166 
chemotherapy arm. 
Consistent OS and PFS benefit were observed across prespecified subgroups, including HR status, 
prior CDK4/6i treatment, number of prior chemotherapies and IHC 1+ and IHC 2+/ISH- status. In the 
HR- subgroup, median OS was 18.2 months (95% CI: 13.6, not estimable) in patients randomised to 
Enhertu compared to 8.3 months (95% CI: 5.6, 20.6) in patients randomised to chemotherapy with a 
hazard ratio of 0.48 (95% CI: 0.24, 0.95). Median PFS was 8.5 months (95% CI: 4.3, 11.7) in patients 
randomised to Enhertu and 2.9 months (95% CI: 1.4, 5.1) in patients randomised to chemotherapy 
with a hazard ratio of 0.46 (95% CI: 0.24, 0.89).  
At an updated descriptive analysis with a median follow-up of 32 months, OS improvements were 
consistent with the primary analysis. The HR in the overall population was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.86) 
with a median OS of 22.9 months (95% CI: 21.2, 24.5) in the Enhertu arm versus 16.8 months 
(95% CI: 14.1, 19.5) in the chemotherapy arm. The Kaplan-Meier curve for the updated OS analysis is 
shown in Figure 5.

NSCLC 
DESTINY-Lung02 (NCT04644237) 
The efficacy and safety of Enhertu were studied in DESTINY-Lung02, a phase 2, randomised study 
evaluating two dose levels. The treatment dosage assignment was blinded to patients and investigators. 
The study included adult patients with metastatic HER2-mutant NSCLC who had received at least one 
regimen containing platinum-based chemotherapy. Identification of an activating HER2 (ERBB2) 
mutation was prospectively determined in tumour tissue by local laboratories using a validated test 
such as next generation sequencing, polymerase chain reaction or mass spectrometry. Patients were 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
randomised 2:1 to receive Enhertu 5.4 mg/kg or 6.4 mg/kg every 3 weeks, respectively. 
Randomisation was stratified by prior anti-programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1) and/or anti-
programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) treatment (yes versus no). Treatment was administered until 
disease progression, death, withdrawal of consent, or unacceptable toxicity. The study excluded 
patients with a history of ILD/pneumonitis requiring treatment with steroids or ILD/pneumonitis at 
screening and clinically significant cardiac disease. Patients were also excluded for untreated and 
symptomatic brain metastases or ECOG performance status >1. 
The primary efficacy outcome measure was confirmed ORR as assessed by BICR using RECIST v1.1. 
The secondary efficacy outcome measure was DOR. 
Demographic and baseline disease characteristics from the 102 patients enrolled in the 5.4 mg/kg arm 
were: median age 59.4 years (range 31 to 84); female (63.7%); Asian (63.7%), White (22.5%), or 
Other (13.7%); ECOG performance status 0 (28.4%) or 1 (71.6%); 97.1% had a mutation in the 
ERBB2 kinase domain, 2.9% in the extracellular domain; 96.1% had a HER2 mutation in exon 19 or 
exon 20; 34.3% had stable brain metastases; 46.1% were former smokers, none were current smokers; 
21.6% had a prior lung resection. In the metastatic setting, 32.4% had greater than 2 prior systemic 
therapies, 100% received platinum-based therapy, 73.5% received anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, and 
50.0% had prior treatment with platinum therapy and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy in combination. 
Efficacy results are summarised in Table 8. The median duration of follow-up was 11.5 months (data 
cutoff: 23 December 2022).

DESTINY-Gastric02 (NCT04014075) 
The efficacy and safety of Enhertu were studied in DESTINY-Gastric02, a Phase 2, multicentre, open-
label, single-arm study conducted at sites in Europe and the United States. The study enrolled patients 
with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who had 
progressed on a prior trastuzumab-based regimen. Patients were required to have centrally confirmed 
HER2 positivity defined as IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH-positive. The study excluded patients with a 
history of ILD/pneumonitis requiring treatment with steroids or ILD/pneumonitis at screening, patients 
with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease, and patients with active brain metastases. 
Enhertu was administered by intravenous infusion at 6.4 mg/kg every three weeks until disease 
progression, death, withdrawal of consent, or unacceptable toxicity. The primary efficacy outcome 
measure was confirmed ORR assessed by ICR based on RECIST v1.1. DOR and OS were secondary 
endpoints. 
Of the 79 patients enrolled in DESTINY-Gastric02, demographic and baseline disease characteristics 
were: median age 61 years (range 20 to 78); 72% were male; 87% were White, 5.0% were Asian and 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.0% were Black or African American. Patients had an ECOG performance status of either 0 (37%) or

DESTINY-Gastric01 (NCT03329690) 
The efficacy and safety of Enhertu were studied in DESTINY-Gastric01, a Phase 2, multicentre, open-
label, randomised study conducted at sites in Japan and South Korea. This supportive study included 
adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who 
had progressed on at least two prior regimens, including trastuzumab, a fluoropyrimidine agent, and a 
platinum agent. Patients were randomised 2:1 to receive either Enhertu (N = 126) or physician’s 
choice of chemotherapy: either irinotecan (N = 55) or paclitaxel (N = 7). Tumour samples were 
required to have centrally confirmed HER2 positivity defined as IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH-positive. The 
study excluded patients with a history of ILD/pneumonitis requiring treatment with steroids or 
ILD/pneumonitis at screening, patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease, and 
patients with active brain metastases. Treatment was administered until disease progression, death, 
withdrawal of consent, or unacceptable toxicity. The primary efficacy outcome measure was 
unconfirmed ORR assessed by ICR based on RECIST v1.1. Overall survival (OS), progression-free 
survival (PFS), DOR, and confirmed ORR were secondary outcome measures. 
Demographic and baseline disease characteristics were similar between treatment arms. Of the 188 
patients, the median age was 66 years (range 28 to 82); 76% were male; 100% were Asian. Patients 
had an ECOG performance status of either 0 (49%) or 1 (51%); 87% had gastric adenocarcinoma and 
13% had GEJ adenocarcinoma; 76% were IHC 3+ and 23% were IHC 2+/ISH-positive; 54% had liver 
metastases; 29% had lung metastases; the sum of diameters of target lesions was < 5 cm in 47%, ≥ 5 to 
< 10 cm in 30%, and ≥ 10 cm in 17%; 55% had two and 45% had three or more prior regimens in the 
locally advanced or metastatic setting. 
Efficacy results (data cutoff date: 03 June 2020) for Enhertu (n = 126) vs. physician’s choice of 
chemotherapy (n = 62) were confirmed ORR 39.7% (95% CI: 31.1, 48.8) vs. 11.3% (95% CI: 4.7, 
21.9). Complete response rate was 7.9% vs. 0% and partial response rate was 31.7% vs. 11.3%. 
Additional efficacy results for Enhertu vs. physician’s choice of chemotherapy were median DOR of 
12.5 months (95% CI: 5.6, NE) vs. 3.9 months (95% CI: 3.0, 4.9). Median PFS was 5.6 months 
(95% CI: 4.3, 6.9) vs. 3.5 months (95% CI: 2.0, 4.3; hazard ratio = 0.47 [95% CI: 0.31, 0.71]). An OS 
analysis, prespecified at 133 deaths, showed survival benefit with Enhertu treatment compared to the 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
physician’s choice group (hazard ratio = 0.60). The median OS was 12.5 months (95% CI: 10.3, 15.2) 
in the Enhertu group and 8.9 months (95% CI: 6.4, 10.4) in the physician’s choice group.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan is administered intravenously. There have been no studies performed with 
other routes of administration. 
Distribution 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, the volume of distribution of the central compartment 
(Vc) of trastuzumab deruxtecan and topoisomerase I inhibitor, DXd, were estimated to be 2.68 L and 
28.0 L, respectively. 
In vitro, the mean human plasma protein binding of DXd was approximately 97%. 
In vitro, the blood to plasma concentration ratio of DXd was approximately 0.6. 
Biotransformation 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan undergoes intracellular cleavage by lysosomal enzymes to release the DXd. 
The humanised HER2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody is expected to be degraded into small peptides and 
amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG. 
In vitro metabolism studies in human liver microsomes indicate that DXd is metabolised mainly by 
CYP3A4 via oxidative pathways. 
Elimination 
Following intravenous administration of trastuzumab deruxtecan in patients with metastatic HER2-
positive, HER2-low breast cancer or HER2-mutant NSCLC, the clearance of trastuzumab deruxtecan 
in population pharmacokinetic analysis was calculated to be 0.4 L/day and the clearance of DXd was 
18.4 L/h. In patients with locally advanced or metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma, trastuzumab 
deruxtecan clearance was 20% higher than in patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. In 
cycle 3, the apparent elimination half-life (t1/2) of trastuzumab deruxtecan and released DXd was 
approximately 7 days. Moderate accumulation (approximately 35% in cycle 3 compared to cycle 1) of 
trastuzumab deruxtecan was observed. 
Following intravenous administration of DXd to rats, the major excretion pathway was faeces via the 
biliary route. DXd was the most abundant component in urine, faeces, and bile. Following single 
intravenous administration of trastuzumab deruxtecan (6.4 mg/kg) to monkeys, unchanged released 
DXd was the most abundant component in urine and faeces. DXd excretion was not studied in 
humans. 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In vitro interactions 
Effects of Enhertu on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products 
In vitro studies indicate DXd does not inhibit major CYP450 enzymes including CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 
2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A. In vitro studies indicate that DXd does not inhibit OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, 
OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE1, MATE2-K, P-gp, BCRP, or BSEP transporters. 
Effects of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of Enhertu 
In vitro, DXd was a substrate of P-gp, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE2-K, MRP1, and BCRP.  
No clinically meaningful interaction is expected with medicinal products that are inhibitors of 
MATE2-K, MRP1, P-gp, OATP1B, or BCRP transporters (see section 4.5). 
Linearity/non-linearity 
The exposure of trastuzumab deruxtecan and released DXd when administered intravenously 
increased in proportion to dose in the 3.2 mg/kg to 8.0 mg/kg dose range (approximately 
0.6 to 1.5 times the recommended dose) with low to moderate inter-subject variability. Based on 
population pharmacokinetic analysis, inter-subject variability in trastuzumab deruxtecan and DXd 
elimination clearances were 24% and 28%, respectively, and for central volume of distribution were 
16% and 55%, respectively. The intra-subject variability in trastuzumab deruxtecan and DXd AUC 
values (area under the serum concentration versus time curve) was approximately 8% and 14%, 
respectively. 
Special populations 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, age (20-96 years), race, ethnicity, sex and body weight 
did not have a clinically meaningful effect on exposure of trastuzumab deruxtecan or released DXd. 
Elderly 
The population PK analysis showed that age (range: 20-96 years) did not affect the PK of trastuzumab 
deruxtecan. 
Renal impairment 
No dedicated renal impairment study was conducted. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis 
including patients with mild (creatinine clearance [CLcr] ≥ 60 and < 90 mL/min) or moderate 
(CLcr ≥ 30 and < 60 mL/min) renal impairment (estimated by Cockcroft-Gault), the pharmacokinetics 
of the released DXd was not affected by mild or moderate renal impairment as compared to normal 
renal function (CLcr ≥ 90 mL/min). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dedicated hepatic impairment study was conducted. Based on population pharmacokinetic 
analysis, the impact of changes on pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab deruxtecan in patients with total 
bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times ULN, irrespective of AST level, is not clinically meaningful. There is limited 
data for patients with total bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 times ULN, irrespective of AST level, to draw 
conclusions, and no data is available for patients with total bilirubin > 3 times ULN, irrespective of 
AST level (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
No studies have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab deruxtecan in 
children or adolescents. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In animals, toxicities were observed in lymphatic and haematopoietic organs, intestines, kidneys, 
lungs, testes and skin following the administration of trastuzumab deruxtecan at exposure levels of the 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
topoisomerase I inhibitor (DXd) below clinical plasma exposure. In these animals, antibody-drug 
conjugate (ADC) exposure levels were similar or above clinical plasma exposure. 
DXd was clastogenic in both an in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay and an in vitro Chinese 
hamster lung chromosome aberration assay and was not mutagenic in an in vitro bacterial reverse 
mutation assay. 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with trastuzumab deruxtecan. 
Dedicated fertility studies have not been conducted with trastuzumab deruxtecan. Based on results 
from general animal toxicity studies, trastuzumab deruxtecan may impair male reproductive function 
and fertility. 
There were no animal reproductive or developmental toxicity studies conducted with trastuzumab 
deruxtecan. Based on results from general animal toxicity studies, trastuzumab deruxtecan and DXd 
were toxic to rapidly dividing cells (lymphatic/haematopoietic organs, intestine, or testes), and DXd 
was genotoxic, suggesting the potential for embryotoxicity and teratogenicity.

Reconstitution 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Reconstitute immediately before dilution. 
More than one vial may be needed for a full dose. Calculate the dose (mg), the total volume of 
reconstituted Enhertu solution required, and the number of vial(s) of Enhertu needed (see 
section 4.2). 
Reconstitute each 100 mg vial using a sterile syringe to slowly inject 5 mL of water for injection 
into each vial to obtain a final concentration of 20 mg/mL. 
Swirl the vial gently until completely dissolved. Do not shake. 
If not used immediately, store the reconstituted Enhertu vials in a refrigerator at 2 ºC to 8 ºC for 
up to 24 hours from the time of reconstitution, protected from light. Do not freeze. 
The reconstituted product contains no preservative and is intended for single use only. 
Dilution 
•  Withdraw the calculated amount from the vial(s) using a sterile syringe. Inspect the 
reconstituted solution for particulates and discolouration. The solution should be clear and 
colourless to light yellow. Do not use if visible particles are observed or if the solution is cloudy 
or discoloured. 
Dilute the calculated volume of reconstituted Enhertu in an infusion bag containing 100 mL of 
5% glucose solution. Do not use sodium chloride solution (see section 6.2). An infusion bag 
made of polyvinylchloride or polyolefin (copolymer of ethylene and polypropylene) is 
recommended. 
Gently invert the infusion bag to thoroughly mix the solution. Do not shake. 
Cover the infusion bag to protect from light.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Enhertu is and what it is used for 
What Enhertu is 
Enhertu is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance trastuzumab deruxtecan. One part of 
the medicine is a monoclonal antibody that attaches specifically to cells that have the protein HER2 on 
their surface (HER2-positive), as some cancer cells do. The other active part of Enhertu is DXd, a 
substance that can kill cancer cells. Once the medicine has attached to HER2-positive cancer cells, the 
DXd enters the cells and kills them. 
What Enhertu is used for 
Enhertu is used to treat adults who have: 
• 
HER2-positive breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic disease) or 
cannot be removed by surgery, and tried one or more other treatments specifically for HER2-
positive breast cancer. 
HER2-low breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic disease) or 
cannot be removed by surgery and received prior therapy for metastatic disease, or your disease 
has returned during or within 6 months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy (after surgery). A 
test will be performed to make sure Enhertu is right for you. 
HER2-mutant non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to other parts of the body or cannot 
be removed by surgery and who have tried a prior treatment. A test will be performed to make 
sure Enhertu is right for you. 
HER2-positive stomach cancer that has spread to other parts of the body or to areas near the 
stomach that cannot be removed by surgery and who have also tried another treatment 
specifically for HER2-positive stomach cancer.

2.  What you need to know before you are given Enhertu 
You must not be given Enhertu 
• 
if you are allergic to trastuzumab deruxtecan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). 
If you are not sure if you are allergic, talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Enhertu. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Enhertu, or during treatment, if you have: 
• 
cough, shortness of breath, fever, or other new or worsening breathing problems. These may be 
symptoms of a serious and potentially fatal lung disease called interstitial lung disease. A 
history of lung disease or kidney problems may increase the risk of developing interstitial lung 
disease. Your doctor may have to monitor your lungs while you are taking this medicine. 
chills, fever, sores in your mouth, stomach pain or pain when urinating. These may be 
symptoms of an infection caused by a reduced number of white blood cells called neutrophils. 
new or worsening shortness of breath, cough, tiredness, swelling of ankles or legs, irregular 
heartbeat, sudden weight gain, dizziness, or loss of consciousness. These may be symptoms of a 
condition in which your heart cannot pump blood well enough (decreased left ventricular 
ejection fraction). 
liver problems. Your doctor may have to monitor your liver while you are taking this medicine. 
• 
• 
• 
Your doctor will carry out tests before and during treatment with Enhertu. 
Children and adolescents 
Enhertu is not recommended for anyone under the age of 18 years. This is because there is no 
information on how well it works in this age group. 
Other medicines and Enhertu 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding, contraception and fertility 
• 
• 
• 
Pregnancy 
Enhertu is not recommended during pregnancy because this medicine may harm the unborn 
baby. 
Speak with your doctor immediately if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are 
planning to become pregnant before or during treatment. 
Breast-feeding  
You should not breast-feed during treatment with Enhertu and for at least 7 months after your 
last dose. This is because it is not known whether Enhertu passes into breast milk. Talk to your 
doctor about this. 
Contraception 
Use effective contraception (birth control) to avoid becoming pregnant while being treated with 
Enhertu. 
Women taking Enhertu should continue contraception for at least 7 months after the last dose of 
Enhertu. 
Men taking Enhertu whose partner may become pregnant should use effective contraception: 
- 
during treatment and 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
for at least 4 months after the last dose of Enhertu. 
Talk to your doctor about the best contraception for you. Also talk to your doctor before you 
stop your contraception. 
• 
Fertility 
If you are a man being treated with Enhertu, you should not father a child for 4 months after 
treatment and take advice on conserving sperm before treatment because the medicine may 
reduce your fertility. Therefore, discuss this with your doctor before starting treatment. 
Driving and using machines 
Enhertu is not likely to reduce your ability to drive or use machines. Be careful if you feel tired, dizzy, 
or have a headache. 
3. 
How you are given Enhertu 
Enhertu will be given to you in a hospital or clinic: 
• 
The recommended dose of Enhertu for the treatment of: 
-  HER2-positive or HER2-low breast cancer is 5.4 mg for every kilogram of your weight, 
every 3 weeks. 
-  HER2-mutant non-small cell lung cancer is 5.4 mg for every kilogram of your weight, 
every 3 weeks. 
-  HER2-positive stomach cancer is 6.4 mg for every kilogram of your weight, every 
3 weeks. 
Your doctor or nurse will give you Enhertu by infusion (drip) into your vein. 
Your first infusion will be given over 90 minutes. If this goes well, the infusion on your next 
visits may be given over 30 minutes. 
Your doctor will decide how many treatments you need. 
Before each Enhertu infusion, your doctor may give you medicines to help prevent nausea and 
vomiting. 
If you get infusion-related symptoms, your doctor or nurse may slow down your infusion or 
interrupt or stop your treatment. 
Before and during treatment with Enhertu, your doctor will carry out tests that may include: 
blood tests to check your blood cells, liver and kidneys 
testing to check your heart and lungs. 
Your doctor may lower your dose, or temporarily or permanently stop your treatment depending 
on your side effects. 
•

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
In order to prevent medicinal product errors, check the vial labels to ensure that the medicinal product 
being prepared and administered is Enhertu (trastuzumab deruxtecan) and not trastuzumab or 
trastuzumab emtansine. 
Appropriate procedures for the preparation of chemotherapeutic medicinal products should be used. 
Appropriate aseptic technique should be used for the following reconstitution and dilution procedures. 
Reconstitution 
• 
• 
Reconstitute immediately before dilution. 
More than one vial may be needed for a full dose. Calculate the dose (mg), the total volume of 
reconstituted Enhertu solution required, and the number of vial(s) of Enhertu needed. 
Reconstitute each 100 mg vial using a sterile syringe to slowly inject 5 mL of water for injection 
into each vial to obtain a final concentration of 20 mg/mL. 
Swirl the vial gently until completely dissolved. Do not shake. 
If not used immediately, store the reconstituted Enhertu vials in a refrigerator at 2 °C to 8 °C for 
up to 24 hours from the time of reconstitution, protected from light. Do not freeze. 
The reconstituted product contains no preservative and is intended for single use only.

Dilution 
•  Withdraw the calculated amount from the vial(s) using a sterile syringe. Inspect the 
reconstituted solution for particulates and discolouration. The solution should be clear and 
colourless to light yellow. Do not use if visible particles are observed or if the solution is cloudy 
or discoloured. 
Dilute the calculated volume of reconstituted Enhertu in an infusion bag containing 100 mL of 
5% glucose solution. Do not use sodium chloride solution. An infusion bag made of 
polyvinylchloride or polyolefin (copolymer of ethylene and polypropylene) is recommended. 
Gently invert the infusion bag to thoroughly mix the solution. Do not shake. 
Cover the infusion bag to protect from light. 
If not used immediately, store at room temperature for up to 4 hours including preparation and 
infusion or in a refrigerator at 2 °C to 8 °C for up to 24 hours, protected from light. Do not 
freeze. 
Discard any unused portion left in the vial.

Administration 
• 
If the prepared infusion solution was stored refrigerated (2 ºC to 8 ºC), it is recommended that 
the solution be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature prior to administration, protected 
from light. 
Administer Enhertu as an intravenous infusion only with a 0.20 or 0.22 micron in-line 
polyethersulfone (PES) or polysulfone (PS) filter. 
The initial dose should be administered as a 90-minute intravenous infusion. If the prior 
infusion was well tolerated, subsequent doses of Enhertu may be administered as 30-minute 
infusions. Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus. 
Cover the infusion bag to protect from light. 
Do not mix Enhertu with other medicinal products or administer other medicinal products 
through the same intravenous line.

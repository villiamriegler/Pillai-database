Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for daptomycin, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
A cumulative review of post-marketing data revealed that there were a total of 17 cases where the reporter 
described organising pneumonia associated with daptomycin therapy without reporting an associated 
diagnosis of pulmonary eosinophilia or eosinophilic pneumonia. The majority describe probable or 
possible organising pneumonia based on a radiographic presentation compatible with eosinophilic 
pneumonia. Definite cases with both histopathological and radiographic descriptions appeared to be 
consistent with the known presentation of eosinophilic pneumonia, but the diagnosis was not initially 
recognised. Organising pneumonia is therefore to be added to section 4.4 of the EU SmPC (special 
warnings and precautions) and to section 4.8 (undesirable effects) as an adverse reaction of not known 
frequency under respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. No changes to the package leaflet are 
required. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for daptomycin the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing daptomycin is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied.

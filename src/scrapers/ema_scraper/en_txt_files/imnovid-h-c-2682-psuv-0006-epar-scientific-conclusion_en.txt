Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Imnovid, the scientific conclusions of 
PRAC are as follows:  
From review of completed studies with pomalidomide, epistaxis has been observed with a frequency of 
9.7% and grade 3/4 epistaxis has been observed with a frequency of 0.7%. The PRAC therefore 
concluded that epistaxis (all reactions) should be listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC with a frequency of 
common and epistaxis (grade 3/4) with a frequency of uncommon. In addition nosebleeds should be 
listed in section 4 the package leaflet with a frequency of common. 
Therefore, in view of available data regarding pomalidomide, the PRAC considered that changes to the 
product information were warranted. The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Imnovid, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance pomalidomide is favourable subject to 
the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied.

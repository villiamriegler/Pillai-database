1.  Introduction 
On 24th October 2017, the MAH (BioMarin International Limited) submitted the final clinical study 
report (CSR) for the extension phase of the SPARK study for Kuvan, in accordance with Article 46 of 
Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
The SPARK study (Study 2009-015758-33) was a 2-part study called “A phase IIIb comparative open-
label clinical study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of Kuvan after 26 weeks 
of treatment in patients <4 years of age with phenylketonuria (PKU)”.   
The initial 26-week part of SPARK was a follow-up measure, FUM005, as well as part of the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) EMA-001476-PIP01-13 for Kuvan.  The results of the 26 week 
treatment phase were submitted to the EMA in September 2014 as part of Type II variation application 
EMEA/H/C/000943/II/0033.   
In this submission, the final CSR of the long-term extension phase of the SPARK study is provided.   
This extension phase was not part of the approved PIP for Kuvan. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
No changes to the approved product information are proposed by the MAH however the Rapporteur 
suggests that the results of the 3 year Extension Period should be added to section 5.1 for information 
to prescribers. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that the SPARK STUDY (A Phase IIIb, multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled 
study of the efficacy, safety and population pharmacokinetics of sapropterin dihydrchloride (Kuvan) in 
Phenylketonuria (PKU) patients <4 years old – 2009-015768-33) is a stand-alone study.  
The initial 26-week part of SPARK was a follow-up measure, FUM005, as well as part of the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) EMA-001476-PIP01-13 for Kuvan.  This study was performed in

2.3.2.  Clinical study 
2009-015768-33 - A Phase IIIb, multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled study of the efficacy, 
safety and population pharmacokinetics of sapropterin dihydrchloride (Kuvan) in Phenylketonuria (PKU) 
patients. 
Description 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate efficacy and safety of Kuvan in infants and children with PKU 
who were <4 years of age at the time of entry into this study and to evaluate the population 
pharmacokinetics (PopPK), as this age group was not studied in the pre-approval trials.  
The main aim of the Extension Period was to evaluate the efficacy over time of Kuvan treatment plus 
phenylalanine (Phe)-restricted diet therapy in increasing dietary Phe tolerance and also to evaluate 
long-term safety. 
Methods 
Objectives 
The primary objectives are: 
• 
• 
• 
To evaluate the efficacy after 26 weeks of Kuvan treatment plus Phe-restricted diet therapy in 
increasing dietary Phe tolerance, as compared to dietary therapy alone in <4 year old infants 
and children with PKU. Phe tolerance was defined as the amount of dietary Phe (mg/kg per 
day) ingested while maintaining blood Phe levels within the range of 120 to 360 μmol/L 
(defined as ≥120 to <360 μmol/L). 
To evaluate the safety after 26 weeks of Kuvan treatment in <4 year-old infants and children 
with PKU. 
To evaluate BH4 (tetrahydrobiopterin; sapropterin) blood levels via scheduled PopPK 
samplings. 
The secondary objectives are: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To evaluate blood Phe levels for all subjects during the 26-week Study Period. 
To evaluate the effectiveness of Kuvan treatment in increasing dietary Phe tolerance, as 
compared to pre-Kuvan treatment during the 26-week Study Period in <4 year-old infants and 
children with PKU. 
To assess neurodevelopmental function during Kuvan treatment, as compared to dietary 
treatment alone, during the 26-week Study Period in < 4 year-old infants and children with 
PKU. 
To investigate the predictive value of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) genotype in BH4 
responsive individuals. 
To assess potential effects on blood pressure during the 26 week Study Period and the 3-year 
Extension Period. 
To assess potential effects on growth during the 26 week Study Period and the 3-year 
Extension Period. 
To evaluate long-term safety, neurodevelopmental outcomes, dietary Phe tolerance, and blood 
Phe levels in the 3-year Extension Period.

Study design 
This study is a multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled study.   
Following Screening, eligible subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive either (a) 10 mg/kg per day 
Kuvan plus a Phe-restricted diet, or (b) just a Phe-restricted diet over a 26-week Study Period.  It was 
intended that all subjects would maintain blood Phe levels within a range of 120 to 360 μmol/L 
(defined as ≥120 to <360 μmol/L) through monitored dietary intake during the 26-week Study Period. 
If after approximately 4 weeks, a subject’s Phe tolerance had not increased by >20% versus baseline, 
the Kuvan dose could have been increased in a single step to 20 mg/kg per day. A PopPK trial was 
included in the Study Period, with collection of baseline (pre-treatment) blood samples for 
measurement of endogenous BH4 levels. PopPK samplings were also to be obtained during trial Weeks 
5 to 12, inclusive.  
After completing the 26-week Study Period, subjects were then eligible for enrolment in the Extension 
Period, in which all subjects who continued in the trial were to receive Kuvan treatment plus a Phe-
restricted diet. For those subjects randomized to the Phe-restricted diet alone during the 26-week 
Study Period, they were commenced on Kuvan at a same starting dose of 10 mg/kg per day in the 
Extension Period.  At the discretion of the Investigator, a dose increase up to a maximum of 20 mg/kg 
per day was to be allowed during the Extension Period. A subject’s treatment during the Extension 
Period was to continue for 3 years or until commercial product was approved for <4 year-old subjects 
with PKU.  
Subjects who achieved their 4th birthday during the Extension Period had the option of remaining in 
the study or exiting the study and obtaining commercial product, while those subjects who had their 
4th birthday during the Study Period had to complete the 26-week phase, unless prematurely 
discontinued from the study. 
Study population /Sample size 
One hundred and nine (109) subjects were screened.  The intention-to-treat (ITT) population included 
all randomised subjects. The trial enrolled 56 subjects with phenylketonuria (PKU) and aged <4 years 
of age at the scheduled Day 1 visit of the 26-week Study Period.  27 subjects received Kuvan plus Phe-
restricted diet and 29 subjects received Phe-restricted diet only.  All randomised subjects in the Kuvan 
plus Phe-restricted diet group received at least one dose of study drug in this study. In total, 51 out of 
the 56 subjects completed the primary 26-week Study Period and continued on to the Extension Period 
of the study. 
The efficacy population consisted of all subjects who were randomised at the start of the Study Period 
and analysed according to the group allocated. For the primary analysis, the efficacy population was 
the ITT population. 
The safety population consisted of all subjects who had some safety assessment data available (at 
least one visit in vital signs, adverse event [AE] or laboratory results) in the Study Period and: 
•  who received at least one dose of Kuvan in the Study Period, or 
•  who were randomised to Phe-restricted diet alone. 
Overall, 54 subjects were included in the safety population (27 subjects in each treatment group).  
At the end of the 26- week Study Period, 51 subjects were eligible and entered the Extension Period.  
No withdrawals due to AE occurred.  
EMA/55539/2018 
Page 5/12 
 
 
 
 
The sample size analysed in the Extension Period was small, and a total of 18 out of 51 subjects 
(35.3%) discontinued the study prematurely. The reason for the majority of the subjects who 
discontinued prematurely, was due to the subject having reached an age where they could be taken off 
study, per the protocol, and switched to commercial drug. 
Two populations were defined for the Extension Period, the intention-to-treat Extension (ITTE) 
population and the per-protocol Extension (PPE) population:   
i. 
The intention-to-treat Extension (ITTE) population included all subjects randomised in the 
Study Period who continued in the Extension Period. All randomised subjects who continued in 
the Extension Period received at least one dose of study drug in the Extension Period. In total, 
33 out of the 51 subjects completed the study. 
ii. 
The per-protocol Extension (PPE) population comprised all subjects in the ITTE population 
without any major protocol deviations. 
In total, 6 subjects had a major protocol deviation during the Extension Period and were thus excluded 
from the PPE population; all were related to adherence to Kuvan (<80% or >125%). 
The safety extension population consisted of all subjects who received at least one dose of Kuvan and 
had some safety assessment data available (at least one visit with vital signs, adverse event [AE] or 
laboratory results). 
Baseline data 
The primary 26-week efficacy analysis included 56 subjects. Thirty (53.6%) were males; 96.4% were 
Caucasians. The overall mean ± SD age was 21.2 ± 12.1 months. 
The mean ± SD age at PKU diagnosis was 27.2 ± 79.8 days for subjects in the Kuvan plus Phe-
restricted diet group and 32.6 ± 72.2 days for subjects in the Phe-restricted diet alone group. 
The mean ± SD blood Phe level at baseline was 287.3 ± 166.6 μmol/L in the Kuvan plus Phe-restricted 
diet group and 352.9 ± 219.9 μmol/L in the Phe-restricted diet alone group. Most subjects had either 
mild (46.4%) or moderate (32.1%) PKU disease severity. Six subjects (22.2%) in the Kuvan plus Phe-
restricted diet group and 5 subjects (17.2%) in the Phe-restricted diet alone group had at least one 
medical history condition on entry to the study. 
The majority of subjects received a concomitant medication during the Study Period (88.9% in the 
Kuvan plus Phe-restricted diet group and 93.1% in the Phe-restricted diet alone group) and in the 
Extension Period (100% in the Kuvan continuous group and 92.3% in the Kuvan Extension only 
group). 
The overall mean ± SD adherence to Kuvan during the Study Period was 100% ± 4.4%, ranging from 
82% to 107%. The overall mean ± SD adherence to diet in the Kuvan plus Phe-restricted diet was 
94.6% ± 9.4%, ranging from 69% to 111%. The overall mean (SD) adherence to Phe-restricted diet 
alone was 92.1% ± 23.8%, ranging from 65% to 183%. 
The overall mean ± SD adherence to Kuvan during the Extension Period was 106.8% ± 25.5%, 
ranging from 74% to 240%. The mean ± SD study treatment duration period was slightly longer in the 
Kuvan continuous group compared with the Kuvan Extension only group (181.4 ± 50.6 weeks and 
136.6 ± 40.7 weeks, respectively). A shorter treatment duration was expected in the Kuvan Extension 
only group as the subjects started receiving Kuvan at the start of the Extension Phase only (expected 
treatment duration 3 years), whereas the Kuvan continuous group started Kuvan treatment at the 
beginning of the Study Period (expected treatment duration 3.5 years).

Treatments 
The test product was Kuvan 100 mg soluble tablets (sapropterin dihydrochloride). 
Eligible subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive either (a) 10 mg/kg per day Kuvan plus a Phe-
restricted diet, or (b) just a Phe-restricted diet over a 26-week Study Period.  If after approximately 4 
weeks, a subject’s Phe tolerance had not increased by >20% versus baseline, the Kuvan dose could 
have been increased in a single step to 20 mg/kg per day. 
For those subjects randomized to the Phe-restricted diet alone during the 26-week Study Period, their 
starting Kuvan dose in the Extension Period was to be 10 mg/kg per day. A dose increase up to a 
maximum of 20 mg/kg per day was to be allowed during the Extension Period at the discretion of the 
Investigator. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint of the study was the dietary Phe tolerance after 26 weeks (6 months) of 
treatment with Kuvan plus Phe-restricted diet as compared to a Phe-restricted diet alone, where Phe 
tolerance was defined as the amount of dietary Phe (mg/kg/day) ingested while maintaining overall 
control of PKU (assessed by mean blood Phe levels within target range, analysis of diet and Kuvan 
treatment compliance).  The dietary Phe tolerance (mg/kg/day) was described using summary 
statistics at each visit of the Study Period, according to treatment group (Kuvan plus Phe-restricted 
diet; Phe-restricted diet alone) and to age group (<12 months; ≥12 months to <24 months; ≥24 
months to <48 months). 
The secondary endpoints comprised: blood Phe-levels and the change from baseline in blood Phe-
levels, change from baseline (prior to enrolment) in dietary Phe tolerance after 26 weeks (6 months) of 
treatment with Kuvan, blood pressure and the change from baseline in blood pressure, physical growth 
parameters (height or length, weight and maximal occipital-frontal head circumference), and age-
related neuromotor developmental milestones and standardised neurodevelopment test results. 
Statistical Methods 
Primary analysis 
The primary endpoint of the study was the dietary Phe tolerance after 26 weeks (6 months) of 
treatment with Kuvan plus Phe-restricted diet as compared to a Phe-restricted diet alone, where Phe 
tolerance was defined as the amount of dietary Phe (mg/kg/day) ingested while maintaining overall 
control of PKU (assessed by mean blood Phe levels within target range, analysis of diet and Kuvan 
treatment compliance). The dietary Phe tolerance (mg/kg/day) was described using summary statistics 
at each visit of the Study Period, according to treatment group (Kuvan plus Phe-restricted diet; Phe-
restricted diet alone) and to age group (<12 months; ≥12 months to <24 months; ≥24 months to <48 
months). The dietary Phe tolerance during the Study Period was analysed using repeated measures 
Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) on the observed records. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints comprised: blood Phe-levels and the change from baseline in blood 
Phe-levels, change from baseline (prior to enrolment) in dietary Phe tolerance after 26 weeks (6 
months) of treatment with Kuvan, blood pressure and the change from baseline in blood pressure, 
physical growth parameters (height or length, weight and maximal occipitalfrontal head 
circumference), and age-related neuromotor developmental milestones and standardised 
neurodevelopment test results, all during the Study Period. The secondary endpoints were analysed 
using descriptive and inferential statistics to compare the two treatment groups (Kuvan plus Phe-
restricted diet and Phe-restricted diet alone) during the Study Period.

Final analysis 
The main aim of the Extension Period was to evaluate the efficacy over time of Kuvan treatment plus 
Phe-restricted diet therapy in increasing dietary Phe tolerance. Phe tolerance was defined as the 
prescribed amount of dietary Phe (mg/kg/day) while maintaining the mean filter-paper blood Phe 
levels within the target ranges (≥120 to <360 μmol/L). The dietary Phe tolerance (mg/kg/day) was 
described using summary statistics at each time point of the Extension Period, according to age group 
(<12 months, ≥12 months to <24 months, ≥24 months to <48 months). The dietary Phe tolerance 
during the Extension Period was analysed using a linear mixed model for repeated measures on the 
observed records applying the likelihood method. 
Results 
Efficacy: 
Primary Efficacy Analysis – 26-week Study Period 
The primary endpoint was the dietary Phe tolerance defined as the prescribed amount of dietary Phe 
(mg/kg/day) while maintaining the mean filter-paper blood Phe levels within the target ranges. After 
26 weeks of treatment with Kuvan plus Phe-restricted diet, dietary Phe tolerance was significantly 
increased compared with dietary therapy alone. At Week 26, the adjusted mean Phe tolerance was 
higher in the Kuvan plus Phe-restricted diet group (80.6 mg/kg/day) compared with the Phe-restricted 
diet alone group (50.1 mg/kg/day). The adjusted difference between the two treatment groups was 
30.5 mg/kg/day (95% CI: 18.7; 42.3) and was statistically significant (p<0.001). 
Overall, BMI SDS, height SDS, max occipital-frontal head circumference SDS and weight SDS were 
maintained along the appropriate growth curves and considered to be normal in subjects in both 
treatment groups with minimal changes noted from baseline. The majority of subjects had normal 
neuromotor development. Statistically, there was no difference between treatment groups for each 
development milestone. During the 26-week Study Period, there were small increases in the number of 
subjects with abnormal findings for some neurodevelopment milestones (assessment gross motor, 
assessment language, assessment personal social). 
Final Efficacy Analysis – 3-year Extension Period 
The main aim of the Extension Study was the dietary Phe tolerance defined as the prescribed amount 
of dietary Phe (mg/kg/day) while maintaining the mean filter-paper blood Phe levels within the target 
ranges. Over 36 months of treatment with Kuvan plus Phe-restricted diet, dietary Phe tolerance was 
significantly increased compared to baseline (first pre-dose visit in the 26-Week Study Period) in the 
Kuvan continuous group. At the End of Study visit the estimate of the difference compared to baseline 
in dietary Phe tolerance was 38.74 mg/kg/day (95% CI: 28.9; 48.6) and was statistically significant 
(p<0.0001), thus demonstrating that the significant increase in dietary Phe tolerance was sustained 
over 3.5 years. In the Kuvan Extension only group, a less pronounced effect was observed, with 
significant differences versus baseline (last visit in the Study Period prior to starting Kuvan) observed 
at Months 9 and 21 only. At the end of the Extension Period, the estimate of the difference compared 
to baseline in dietary Phe tolerance was 5.48 mg/kg/day (95% CI: -2.8; 13.8), and was not 
statistically significant (p=0.1929). 
The results in the PPE population for the Kuvan continuous group were consistent with those observed 
in the ITTE population. In the Kuvan Extension only group, the analysis of the PPE population showed 
that the estimate of the difference compared to baseline was significant at the majority of time points, 
with the exception of Months 3, 24 and 36 (End of Extension Period) only. Therefore, by excluding 2 
subjects from the analysis with major protocol deviations (1 subject with >125% adherence to Kuvan 
EMA/55539/2018 
Page 8/12 
 
 
 
 
and 1 subject with <80% adherence to Kuvan), the dietary Phe tolerance had improved significantly 
compared to baseline. 
In the Kuvan continuous group, blood Phe levels remained stable over time, with no significant 
changes observed in blood Phe level from baseline to any visit during the Extension Period. In the 
Kuvan Extension only group, decreases in blood Phe level were observed at all visits compared with 
baseline during the Extension Period, with statistically significant decreases in blood Phe level from 
baseline to Months 21, 30, and 33. This indicates that in this group of subjects the dietary 
phenylalanine supply could have been increased leading to a higher dietary phenylalanine tolerance. 
Due to the study protocol with less frequent adjustments during the Extension Period this did not 
always take place. This observation underscores the need for thorough biochemical and dietary 
monitoring of patients under Kuvan treatment to optimize the benefit for the patient. No differences 
between the age groups were observed for the change in blood Phe levels during the Extension Period. 
The results for the PPE population analysis were consistent with the results observed for the ITTE 
population. 
The proportion of subjects maintaining mean filter-paper blood Phe levels both ≤360 μmol/L and within 
the range ≥120 μmol/L to <360 μmol/L was greater in the Kuvan Extension only group compared with 
the Kuvan continuous group. However, it was expected that there would be variance outside of these 
ranges during the course of the 3-year Extension Period. 
During the 3-year Extension Period, weight SDS, max occipital-frontal head circumference SDS and 
weight SDS were maintained along the same growth curves and considered to be normal in subjects in 
both treatment groups and only small and non-statistically significant changes were noted from 
baseline. This indicates that long-term treatment with Kuvan plus Phe restricted diet does not impact 
growth parameters and subjects were able to grow normally. 
The majority of subjects had normal neuromotor development and there were no differences between 
treatment groups for any development milestone. The number of subjects with abnormal findings in 
neurodevelopment milestones decreased in all areas across both treatment groups by the end of the 
study. 
Safety: 
The safety of Kuvan in Study EMR700773-003 (BMN 162-503) was assessed by the type, frequency 
and intensity of AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, total number of AEs, total number of subjects with 
AE, number of treatment-related AEs, number of AEs resulting in treatment discontinuation, number of 
withdrawals from the trial, and physical examination findings including vital signs and laboratory tests. 
The safety analysis included 54 subjects. All subjects experienced at least one AE. Thirty-one out of 
282 events (11.0%) were classified as related to Kuvan and were experienced by 8 out of 27 subjects 
(29.6%). 
Kuvan was generally well-tolerated in subjects <4 years. There were no deaths during the study and 
no subjects withdrew from the study or permanently discontinued treatment due to an AE during the 
26-week Study Period or the 3-year Extension Period. 
During the 26-week Study Period, 8 out of 27 subjects (29.6%) in the Kuvan plus Phe-restricted diet 
group experienced 31/282 (11.0%) events that were classified as related to Kuvan. All other AEs were 
not related to the investigational drug. Most AEs, 273 (96.8%) in the Kuvan plus Phe-restricted diet 
group and 260 (93.5%) in the Phe-restricted diet alone group, were mild; all other AEs were 
moderate. 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported for 3 subjects in the Kuvan plus Phe-restricted diet group 
(gastroenteritis, rash, stomatitis and Kuvan overdose) and 1 subject in the Pherestricted diet alone 
EMA/55539/2018 
Page 9/12 
 
 
 
 
group (bronchiolitis and bronchopneumonia). All SAEs were unrelated to study drug. There were no 
cases of early withdrawal from the trial due to AE. 
The treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) reported with the highest incidence (≥ 30% of subjects in either 
group by System Organ Class [SOC]) in the Kuvan plus Phe-restricted diet group and the Phe-
restricted diet alone group were in the following SOCs, respectively: infections and infestations (81.5% 
and 81.5%), general disorders and administration site conditions (63.0% and 66.7%), gastrointestinal 
disorders (63.0% and 59.3%), respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (51.9% and 59.3%) and 
investigations (44.4% and 40.7%). 
The most common (≥ 40% of subjects in either group by preferred term [PT]) TEAEs in the Kuvan plus 
Phe-restricted diet group and the Phe-restricted diet group alone, respectively were: pyrexia (63.0% 
and 66.7%), cough (48.1% and 48.1%) and nasopharyngitis (48.1% and 40.7%). Differences were 
observed between the treatment groups for the following PTs: rhinorrhoea (7.4% and 29.6%) and 
upper respiratory tract infection (3.7% and 22.2%). 
Analysis of clinical laboratory data and vital signs did not reveal any adverse effects from treatment 
with Kuvan. 
There were no clinically significant changes in height, height standard deviation score (SDS), weight, 
weight SDS, BMI, BMI SDS, heart rate, diastolic blood pressure (DBP), systolic blood pressure (SBP), 
temperature, max occipital-frontal head circumference, max occipital-frontal head circumference SDS 
and respiratory rate during the trial. 
Extension Period: 
During the 3-year Extension Period, 9 out of 25 subjects (36.0%) in the Kuvan continuous group 
experienced 40/838 (4.8%) events that were classified as related to Kuvan. In the Kuvan Extension 
only group, 4 out of 26 subjects (15.4%) experienced 7/563 (1.2%) events that were classified as 
related to Kuvan. All other AEs were classified as not related to the investigational drug. The majority 
of AEs, 795 events (94.9%) in the Kuvan continuous group and 533 events (94.7%) in the Kuvan 
Extension only group, were mild. Two subjects (8.0%) experienced 2 TEAEs considered to be severe in 
the Kuvan continuous group and 2 subjects (7.7%) experienced 3 TEAEs considered to be severe in 
the Kuvan Extension only group. Ten subjects (40.0%) experienced 41 TEAEs considered to be 
moderate in severity in the Kuvan continuous group and 11 subjects (42.3%) experienced 27 TEAEs 
considered to be moderate in severity in the Kuvan Extension only group. 
Serious adverse events were reported for 13 subjects, none of which were assessed as related to study 
drug by the Investigator. Six subjects (24.0%) had SAEs in the Kuvan continuous group and 7 subjects 
(26.9%) had SAEs in the Kuvan Extension only group. All subjects recovered from the SAEs. In 
addition, 1 subject in the Kuvan Extension only group had 2 events of bronchiolitis that occurred pre-
treatment. There were no cases of early withdrawal from the trial due to AE. 
The TEAEs reported with the highest incidence (>60% of subjects in either group by System Organ 
Class [SOC]) in the Kuvan continuous group and the Kuvan Extension only group were in the following 
SOCs, respectively: infections and infestations (100% and 92.3%), general disorders and 
administration site conditions (92.0% and 84.6%), gastrointestinal disorders (84.0% and 73.1%) and 
respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (84.0% and 61.5%). 
The most common (≥ 40% of subjects in either group by PT) TEAEs in the Kuvan continuous group and 
the Kuvan Extension only group were: diarrhoea (48.0% and 42.3%), vomiting (68.0% and 61.5%), 
pyrexia (92.0% and 84.6%), nasopharyngitis (68.0% and 46.2%), pharyngitis (52.0% and 11.5%), 
rhinitis (52.0% and 23.1%), amino acid level decreased (44.0% and 11.5%), and cough (76.0% and 
EMA/55539/2018

57.7%). Differences were observed between the treatment groups for the following PTs: pharyngitis 
(52.0% and 11.5%), rash (28.0% and 11.5%), and amino acid level decreased (44.0% and 11.5%). 
Analysis of clinical laboratory data and vital signs did not reveal any adverse effects from treatment 
with Kuvan. 
There were no clinically significant changes in height, height SDS, weight, weight SDS, BMI, BMI SDS, 
heart rate, DBP, SBP, temperature, max occipital-frontal head circumference, max occipital-frontal 
head circumference SDS and respiratory rate during the trial. 
Overall, the results of the safety analysis demonstrated the good safety profile for Kuvan in subjects 
>4 years old from the first 26-week Study Period which is maintained in the 3-year Extension Period 
and is in-line with information included in the currently approved product information. 
Efficacy results 
The results of this trial showed that the addition of Kuvan to a phenylalanine (Phe)-restricted diet in 
patients <4 years old significantly improved Phe tolerance over 26 weeks compared with Phe-restricted 
diet alone. 
The results of this 3-year Extension Period demonstrated that long-term treatment with Kuvan plus a 
Phe-restricted diet maintained dietary Phe tolerance over 3.5 years.   
Safety results 
The results of this trial showed that Kuvan is safe and well tolerated in the investigated population with 
oral administration. 
The results of this 3-year Extension Period demonstrated that the long-term safety profile of Kuvan 
during the Extension Period also continued to be favourable. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The results of this trial were submitted to the EMA in September 2014 as part of a Type II variation 
application EMEA/H/C/000943/II/0033. They showed that the addition of Kuvan to a phenylalanine 
(Phe)-restricted diet in patients <4 years old significantly improved Phe tolerance over 26 weeks 
compared with Phe-restricted diet alone, and that Kuvan is safe and well tolerated in the investigated 
population with oral administration. The variation application was approved on 22 June 2015, 
broadening the indication to include children of all age ranges. 
This 3-year Extension Period demonstrated that long-term treatment with Kuvan plus a Phe-restricted 
diet maintained dietary Phe tolerance over 3.5 years.  The long-term safety profile of Kuvan during the 
Extension Period also continued to be favourable. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The initial Study Period of this trial showed that the addition of Kuvan to a Phe-restricted diet in PKU 
patients <4 years old significantly improved Phe tolerance compared with Phe-restricted diet alone 
over a 26-week Study Period. The newly available results from the Extension-Period demonstrates that 
long-term treatment with Kuvan plus a Phe-restricted diet in subjects <4 years old maintained dietary 
Phe tolerance over 3.5 years. The long-term safety profile of Kuvan during the Extension Period 
continued to be favourable. Data from this Extension study continue to support the favourable 
risk/benefit profile for Kuvan in paediatric PKU patients. Results from this study are in agreement with 
those observed in the studies the Sponsor conducted in subjects >4 years old.

The data collected in this study are consistent with the data reflected in the EU Product Information, 
and no update to any of the components is proposed at this time. 
This is agreed by the Rapporteur. 
Based on the review of the submitted data, this application regarding the submission of the final 
clinical study report (CSR) for the extension phase of the SPARK study for Kuvan, in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended, 
is approvable subject to satisfactory response to the additional clarification requested in section 4. 
(Supported by MSs) 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required. 
4.  Additional clarification requested 
No changes to the approved product information are proposed by the MAH however the Rapporteur 
suggests that the results of the 3 year Extension Period should be added to section 5.1 for information 
to prescribers. 
The MAH should either submit a variation in accordance with Articles 16 and 17 of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004 or provide a justification for not doing so. This should be provided without any delay and no 
later than 60 days after the receipt of these conclusions.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Genzyme Europe BV submitted to 
the European Medicines Agency on 10 March 2020 an application for a variation. 
The following changes were proposed:

C.I.4 Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC in order to update pharmacodynamic information based on 
interim results from study D4200C00104, listed as a specific obligation in the Annex II. This is an 
observational study (including a retrospective arm to evaluate the Benefit/Risk of vandetanib 
(Caprelsa) 300 mg in RET mutation negative and RET mutation positive patients with symptomatic, 
aggressive, sporadic, unresectable, locally advanced/metastatic thyroid cancer (MTC)), to confirm the 
efficacy and safety of Caprelsa in RET-negative patients with the aim to fulfil SOB001 and convert 
Caprelsa from conditional to normal Marketing Authorisation. 
In addition the MAH takes to opportunity to rectify the Dutch translation of the Caprelsa Product 
Information. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II 
and Package Leaflet. 
In the second round, the MAH also proposed to update section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance  
The MAH submitted a variation application under category C.1.4 of the variation classification Guideline 
with the scope to include “Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC in order to update pharmacodynamic 
information based on interim results from study D4200C00104, listed as a specific obligation in the 
Annex II. This is an observational study (including a retrospective arm to evaluate the Benefit/Risk of 
vandetanib (Caprelsa) 300 mg in RET mutation negative and RET mutation positive patients with 
symptomatic, aggressive, sporadic, unresectable, locally advanced/metastatic thyroid cancer (MTC)), 
to confirm the efficacy and safety of Caprelsa in RET-negative patients with the aim to fulfil SOB001 
and convert the marketing authorization for Caprelsa from a conditional to normal marketing 
authorisation”. No changes were proposed in section 4.1 ‘Therapeutic indications’. 
In the current type II labelling variation, the MAH includes an update with the results of the data 
analysis from 23 MTC RET negative patients treated with vandetanib with the aim to fulfill SOB001 and 
convert the Marketing Authorisation from conditional to normal. Consequently, the MAH proposes to 
delete the provisions relative to the Specific Obligation from the Product Information. No changes are 
proposed in section 4.1 ‘Therapeutic indications’. In the second round, the MAH considered that the 
provisions relative to the RET mutation status embedded in section 4.4 ‘Special warnings and 
precautions for use’ should also be modified. 
In 2012, conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) was granted for vandetanib for the treatment of 
aggressive and symptomatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) in patients with unresectable locally 
advanced or metastatic disease. The approval of vandetanib was based on the randomised, double-
blind, placebo-controlled study D4200C00058. Superiority of vandetanib was demonstrated compared 
to placebo, with a 11.2 months increase (19.3 vs not reached [predicted 30.5 months]) of median PFS 
Assessment report

Page 6/94 
 
 
 
 
(HR=0.46, 95% CI 0.31-0.69, p=0.0001). RET mutation status was positive in 187 (56.5%) patients, 
unknown in 138 (41.1%), and negative in 8 patients (2.4%), including 2 patients in the vandetanib 
group. A correlation between RET mutation status and clinical outcome could therefore not be 
evaluated. Following a post-hoc analysis, efficacy endpoints were studied for 79 patients (71 patients 
with sporadic MTC previously classified as RET mutation “unknown” and 8 patients with sporadic MTC 
previously classified as RET mutation “negative”) that were identified as without M918T mutation and 
with no other RET mutation: 46 patients were randomised to vandetanib and 33 patients to placebo. In 
the RET mutation positive group (n=187) predicted median PFS was 29 months in the vandetanib 
group vs 18 months in the placebo group (HR=0.45, 95% CI 0.26-0.78). In the patients with no 
M918T mutation and no other identified mutation (n=79) predicted PFS was 28 vs 18 months in the 
vandetanib vs placebo group, respectively. In the vandetanib arm, ORR was 52% for RET mutation 
positive patients and 35% in patients with no M918T mutation and no other identified mutation. 
Therefore, a CMA was granted. A lack of knowledge allowing adequate B/R determination in RET 
negative patients was acted. The following information was added in the SmPC section 4.1: “For 
patients in whom Rearranged during Transfection (RET) mutation is not known or is negative, a 
possible lower benefit should be taken into account before individual treatment decision”. In addition, 
in order to confirm the efficacy and safety of vandetanib, the MAH had to submit as a SOB the final 
clinical study report of study D4200C00104, an observational study to evaluate the B/R of vandetanib 
300 mg in RET mutation negative and RET mutation positive patients with symptomatic, aggressive, 
sporadic, unresectable, and locally advanced/metastatic thyroid cancer. Forty RET mutation positive 
and forty RET mutation negative patients were planned to be enrolled in the study 
[EMEA/H/C/002315/0000, EPAR EMA/128076/2012]. 
In 2017, the MAH submitted a type II variation to request the switch of the CMA to a standard 
marketing authorisation not subject to specific obligations (EMEA/H/C/002315/II/0028). The MAH 
provided updated results of study D4200C00104. For efficacy, as of 02 August 2018, 34 patients have 
been enrolled, 26 of whom were RET mutation positive and 8 were RET mutation negative. The ORR 
was 19.2% (5 patients with CR or PR maintained for 2 or more consecutive assessments) in RET 
positive population and 0% for RET negative patients (3 patients with PR not maintained for 2 or more 
consecutive assessments). The DCR was similar in RET positive and negative patients (50% in each 
group) with at least SD observed post-baseline in 4 RET negative patients and in 13 RET positive 
patients. The data for PFS and OS were not mature. The CHMP was of the opinion that the data 
provided by the MAH to better define B/R in the RET negative population were immature and limited. 
The B/R remained positive in the overall population of the indication, but the data were still insufficient 
to define a clear B/R in the RET negative population. The information regarding RET mutation should 
not be deleted from the sections 4.1, 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC. As a result, the conditions were not 
fully met to convert CMA into full approval. The feasibility to obtain data from 40 patients was 
discussed and dismissed, with a sample size between 40 and 50 patients with symptomatic, 
aggressive, sporadic, unresectable, locally advanced/metastatic MTC receiving vandetanib: 20 to 25 
RET mutation negative and 20 to 25 RET mutation positive. The SOB with due date Q3 2020 was 
reworded as follows: 
"In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of Caprelsa in RET-negative patients, the MAH should submit: 
−  The clinical study report of Study D4200C00104, an observational study including a retrospective 
arm to evaluate the Benefit/Risk of vandetanib (Caprelsa) 300 mg in RET mutation negative and RET 
mutation  positive  patients  with  symptomatic,  aggressive,  sporadic,  unresectable, 
locally 
advanced/metastatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). 
−  The re-evaluation of treatment efficacy in RET-negative patients based on the re-analysis of archived 
tumour samples from the pivotal study D4200C00058." 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/30610/2023  
Page 7/94 
 
 
 
In the current type II variation, the MAH provides updated data from study D4200C00104 and re-
analysis data from study D4200C00058. Data from the latter were already provided during the last 
renewal (EMEA/H/C/002315/R/0041). 
In the final CSR and addendum to CSR for study D4200C00104 (OBS14778), data from the 
observational D4200C00104 study (prospectively and retrospectively enrolled patients) that started in 
Q1 2014 and the phase 3 D4200C00058 study (limited to reanalyzed samples that were previously 
categorized as RET mutation “unknown”) were pooled. Regarding efficacy, tumour response was 
evaluated based on investigator assessment in 55 RET positive patients and 20 RET negative patients. 
The ORR was 41.8% (95% CI: 28.7-55.9) for RET positive patients (n=23 with 2 CR and 21 PR) and 
5.0% (n=1 [PR]) for RET negative patients. More RET positive patients experienced a CR or PR 
compared to RET negative patients (CR: 3.6% versus 0%; PR: 38.2% versus 5.0%, respectively). The 
one patient achieving a PR in the RET negative cohort was from study D4200C00058 and had a RAS 
mutation. SD was reported in 43.6% of the RET positive patients and 85.0% of the RET negative 
patients. DCR (CR, PR, or SD) was 85.5% in the cohort with RET positive patients and 90% in the 
cohort with RET negative patients. Median DOR was 24.9 months in the RET positive patients and for 
the 1 RET negative patient this was 5.3 months. Median PFS (95% CI) was 24.6 months (95% CI: 
15.6-31.8) in RET positive patients and 24.6 months (95% CI: 9.9-59.5) in RET negative patients. 
There were 4 deaths (11.1%) in RET positive patients and 2 (14.3%) in RET negative patients. Time 
dependent outcomes are difficult to interpret in this non-randomized, observational study. In the latest 
response, the MAH provided an addendum to the CSR with analyses based on blinded central review 
for the D500C00058 patients. The data from the patients included in the observational part did not 
change. Compared to the previous results, there were three additional evaluable patients in the RET 
positive population and one additional evaluable patient in the RET negative population from study 
D4200C0058 using the blinded central review data. ORR in the RET positive population was 39.7% 
(compared to 41.8% previously) and in the RET negative population ORR was 9.5% (compared to 
5.0% previously) when using blinded central review for the patients in study D4200C0058. In total 2 
out of 21 RET negative patients had a partial response based on central review, no complete responses 
were reported. Median DOR was not estimable for the RET negative population. The one responder per 
investigator assessment is different (E1201002) than the two responders per central review 
(E1001011 and E1701002). Per central review, patient E1201002 had stable disease. It should also be 
noted that for the patients in the observational part, only investigator assessment is available. It is, 
therefore, preferred to analyse all patients per investigator assessment. 
ORR in the RET positive patients was comparable to that shown in study D4200C0058 (i.e. 45%). 
However, the response rate of 9.5% or 5%, depending on the used tumour assessment method, in 
RET negative patients was substantially lower than the response rate of 35% in the cohort of 46 
patients who were classified as RET negative (i.e. “with no M918T mutation and no other identified 
mutation”) and treated with vandetanib in the registration study. At time of CMA, RET mutation status 
was determined by sequencing the 6 most commonly mutated exons in MTC (exon 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 
and 16) and by amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) analysis. A RET negative mutation 
status was defined as having the sequencing assay successfully showing wild type sequence at all 6 
exons plus the ARMS assay negative for a M918T mutation. According to the MAH, it was anticipated at 
that time that patients with no M918T mutation had a high probability to have no additional RET 
mutation. Using new technologies, part of the samples in study D4200C00058 were reanalysed, which 
confirmed RET negative status in only 11 of 46 patients previously classified as RET negative at time of 
CMA. The remaining 35 patients were reclassified as RET positive. The new technologies used were a 
custom Taqman assay to genotype the RET M918T mutation and, when adequate material was 
available, sequencing using Illumina technology to reveal any other RET mutations. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/30610/2023  
Page 8/94 
 
 
 
 
Regarding safety, 91 patients received at least 1 dose of vandetanib (64 RET positive and 27 RET 
negative) with a median exposure of around 2 years. Based on the provided results, a higher rate of 
AEs (98 vs 89%) and serious AEs (31 vs 22%) were reported in the RET positive compared to the RET 
negative patients. Most common AEs observed were diarrhea, rash, and hypertension. It is agreed with 
the MAH that the reported AEs are consistent with the known safety profile of vandetanib. It is noted 
that the toxicity profile is substantial and should be weighed against the benefit in RET negative 
patients. 
The MAH concludes that based on the provided clinical and literature data, discrepancies in RET testing 
quality between institutions as well as the lack of standard of care for RET negative patients, 
vandetanib should remain a treatment option for patients with aggressive, symptomatic, unresectable, 
locally advanced or metastatic MTC. This is not agreed. The response rate of 35% in the group with 
“no M918T mutation and no other RET mutation identified” at time of the CMA now appears to be 
based on inaccurate data, as the majority of patients was actually RET positive. In a pooled set of 21 
or 20 patients pending on the used tumour assessment, the response rate is at best 9.5% and DOR is 
not estimable. It is unlikely that the reported response rate of 9.5 or 5% in RET negative patients will 
translate into a clinical benefit. Combined with the known toxicity profile of vandetanib and that RET 
testing is expected to play a more and more important role in MTC, given the developments in 
treatments specifically targeting RET, the benefits do not outweigh the risks in the RET negative 
population and the indication is restricted to RET mutant patients, in which the B/R remains positive. 
In addition, the SOB can be considered fulfilled. 
Based on the assessment of the data contained in the application, the CHMP is of the view that the 
following changes to the MA should be introduced “Update of sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1 of the 
SmPC to reflect the restriction of the indication for Caprelsa (vandetanib) for the treatment of 
aggressive and symptomatic RET mutant medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) in patients with unresectable 
locally advanced or metastatic disease based on the results of the D4200C00104 study and the re-
evaluation of efficacy in RET negative patients from study D4200C00058, both listed as a specific 
obligation in the Annex II; the Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. As a result of this variation, the 
CHMP also recommends the granting of a marketing authorisation no longer subject to specific 
obligations”. These changes fall under category C.1.6 of the variation classification Guideline.  
In  reply  to  the  request  for  supplementary  information,  the  MAH  updated  the  product  information 
accordingly.  In  addition,  the  MAH  was  requested  to  provide  a  draft  DHPC  and  communication  plan 
regarding the restricted indication.

Annex II and PL are also updated to reflect the completion of the specific obligations and the 
CHMP recommendation to grant a marketing authorisation no longer subject to specific 
obligations. In addition, the Dutch translation of the Caprelsa (vandetanib) Product Information 
is rectified.  
is recommended for approval. 
The CHMP,  having considered the application as set out in the appended assessment report and having 
reviewed the data submitted by the marketing authorisation holder including the evidence concerning 
compliance  with  specific  obligations,  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  the  above 
mentioned medicinal product remains favourable, that all specific obligations laid down in Annex II have 
been  fulfilled  and  that  comprehensive  data  supports  a  favourable  benefit-risk  balance  of  the  above 
mentioned medicinal product. Therefore, pursuant to Article 14-a(8) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, 
the CHMP recommends by consensus the granting of a marketing authorisation in accordance with Article 
14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 for Caprelsa (vandetanib). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In  view  of  the  data  submitted  with  the  variation,  amendments  to  Annex(es)  I,  II  and  IIIB  are 
recommended. 
As a result of this variation, it is recommended that the following obligation is deleted from the Annex 
II to the Opinion:

5.  Introduction 
Background on medullary thyroid cancer 
Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is a neuroendocrine tumour of the parafollicular or C cells of the thyroid 
gland.  Systemic  symptoms  may  occur  due  to  hormonal  secretion  by  the tumour  causing  for  example 
diarrhoea or flushing in patients with advanced disease [Tuttle et al., UpToDate, 2019]. 
RET  and  RAS  proto-oncogene  mutations  are  detected  in  about  90%  of  MTCs  and  are  considered  the 
predominant drivers of MTC. RET mutations occur sporadically or can be inherited as germline events 
associated with familial MTC or the multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes type 2A and 2B (MEN2A and 
MEN2B). A quarter of MTCs occur as part of an inherited syndrome, and germline RET mutations are 
present in up to 10% of the patients presenting with apparently sporadic MTCs [Filetti et al., Annals of 
Oncology, 2019]. 
Distant metastases are present at diagnosis in approximately 10% of all MTC patients, but higher rates 
are  observed  during  follow-up  [Filetti  et  al.,  Annals  of  Oncology,  2019].  Patients  with  progressive  or 
symptomatic metastatic disease who cannot be treated by surgery or radiotherapy should be considered 
candidates for systemic therapy [Sherman et al., UptoDate, 2020]. Cabozantinib and vandetanib are the 
first-line systemic treatments for progressive metastatic MTC according to the ESMO guideline for thyroid 
cancer [Filetti et al., Annals of Oncology, 2019]. 
Background on regulatory history 
Vandetanib (Caprelsa) is a multi-target inhibitor targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 
(VEGFR-2  also  known  as  kinase  insert  domain  containing  receptor  [KDR]),  epidermal  growth  factor 
receptor  (EGFR)  and  RET  tyrosine  kinases.  Vandetanib  is  also  a  sub-micromolar  inhibitor  of  vascular 
endothelial receptor-3 tyrosine kinase. 
Vandetanib  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  aggressive  and  symptomatic  MTC  in  patients  with 
unresectable  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  disease.  The  approval  of  vandetanib  is  based  on  the 
randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study  D4200C00058.  Superiority  of  vandetanib  was 
demonstrated compared to placebo, with a 11.2 months increase (19.3 vs not reached [predicted 30.5 
months]) of median PFS (HR=0.46, 95% CI 0.31-0.69, p=0.0001). RET mutation status was positive in 
187 (56.5%) patients, unknown in 138 (41.1%), and negative in only 8 patients (2.4%), including 2 
patients in the vandetanib group. A correlation between RET mutation status and clinical outcome could 
therefore not be evaluated. Following a post-hoc analysis, efficacy endpoints were studied for 79 patients 
(71  patients  with  sporadic  MTC  previously  classified  as  RET  mutation  “unknown”  and  8  patients  with 
sporadic MTC previously classified as RET mutation “negative“) that were identified as without M918T 
mutation and with no other RET mutation: 46 patients were randomised to vandetanib and 33 patients 
to placebo. Efficacy results in both groups are shown in Table 1.

Therefore,  conditional  marketing  authorisation  was  granted  in  2012.  A  lack  of  knowledge  allowing 
adequate B/R determination in RET negative patients was acted. The following information was added in 
the  SmPC  section  4.1:  “For  patients  in  whom  Rearranged  during  Transfection  (RET)  mutation  is  not 
known or is negative, a possible lower benefit should be taken into account before individual treatment 
decision”. In addition, in order to confirm the efficacy and safety of vandetanib, the MAH had to submit 
as a SOB the final clinical study report of study D4200C00104, an observational study to evaluate the 
B/R  of  vandetanib  300  mg  in  RET  mutation  negative  and  RET  mutation  positive  patients  with 
symptomatic, aggressive, sporadic, unresectable, and locally advanced/metastatic thyroid cancer. Forty 
RET mutation positive and forty RET mutation negative patients were planned to be enrolled in the study 
[EMEA/H/C/002315/0000, EPAR EMA/128076/2012]. 
In  2017,  the  MAH  submitted  a  type  II  variation  to  request  the  switch  of  the  conditional  marketing 
authorisation 
to  a  standard  marketing  authorisation  not  subject 
to  specific  obligations 
(EMEA/H/C/002315/II/0028). The MAH provided updated results of study D4200C00104. For efficacy, 
as of 02 August 2018, 34 patients have been enrolled, 26 (76.5%) of whom are RET mutation positive 
and 8 (23.5%) are RET mutation negative. Median duration of follow-up was 1 year, and 14 patients 
(41.2%) including 4 RET negative are still receiving treatment with vandetanib in the study. Treatment 
was interrupted in 4 RET negative patients due to disease progression (n=2), due to lack of therapeutic 
response (n=1) and due to AE (n=1). Sixteen RET positive patients discontinued prior to completing the 
study, 5 due to “other” (reason not specified), 4 due to lack of therapeutic response, and 4 due to AEs. 
Two patients discontinued due to death (due to disease progression), and 1 discontinued due to patient 
decision.  The  ORR  was  19.2%  (5  patients  with  CR  or  PR  maintained  for  2  or  more  consecutive 
assessments)  in  RET  positive  population  and  0%  for  RET  negative  patients  (3  patients  with  PR  not 
maintained for 2 or more consecutive assessments). The DCR was similar in RET positive and negative 
patients (50% in each group) with at least SD observed post-baseline in 4 RET negative patients and in 
13 RET positive patients. The data for PFS and OS were not mature. The CHMP was of the opinion that 
the data provided by the MAH to better define B/R in the RET negative population were immature and 
limited. The data strongly suggested that inhibition of the RET pathway is not the single factor in MTC 
disease control and that other mechanisms are involved in tumour growth and inhibition, e.g. VEGFR 
and EGFR pathways. The B/R remained positive in the overall population of the indication, but the data 
were still insufficient to define a clear B/R in the RET negative population. The information regarding RET 
mutation should not be deleted from the sections 4.1, 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC. As a result, the conditions 
were not fully met to convert CMA into full approval. The feasibility to obtain data from 40 patients was 
discussed and dismissed, with a sample size between 40 and 50 patients with symptomatic, aggressive, 
sporadic, unresectable, locally advanced/metastatic MTC receiving vandetanib: 20 to 25 RET mutation 
negative and 20 to 25 RET mutation positive. The SOB with due date Q3 2020 was reworded as follows: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/30610/2023  
Page 13/94 
 
 
 
 
"In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of Caprelsa in RET-negative patients, the MAH should submit: 
−  The clinical study report of Study D4200C00104, an observational study including a retrospective 
arm to evaluate the Benefit/Risk of vandetanib (Caprelsa) 300 mg in RET mutation negative and RET 
mutation  positive  patients  with  symptomatic,  aggressive,  sporadic,  unresectable, 
locally 
advanced/metastatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). 
−  The re-evaluation of treatment efficacy in RET-negative patients based on the re-analysis of archived 
tumour samples from the pivotal study D4200C00058." 
In the current type II labelling variation, the MAH includes an update to the Caprelsa SmPC, section 5.1 
‘Pharmacodynamic properties’, with the results of the data analysis from 23 MTC RET negative patients 
all treated with vandetanib with the aim to fulfill SOB001 and convert the Marketing Authorisation from 
conditional to normal. Consequently, the MAH proposes to delete the provisions relative to the Specific 
Obligation from the Product Information. No changes are proposed in section 4.1 ‘Therapeutic indications’ 
and the provisions relative to the RET mutation status embedded in section 4.4 ‘Special warnings and 
precautions for use’ are not modified. 
Of note, the MAH states that as agreed with the EMA (in accordance with the communication dated 22 
January 2020 and appended to the Cover Letter of this application), the MAH is not providing an updated 
RMP. That will be provided in another variation upon approval of the current type II labelling variation 
at  a  later  stage.  Moreover,  the  MAH  is  planning  to  provide  the  final  clinical  study  report  for  study 
D4200C00104  final  Clinical  Study  Report  (CSR)  at  a  later  stage,  and  it  is  therefore  not  part  of  this 
submission package, which is according to the MAH in accordance to the CHMP and PRAC Rapporteurs’ 
joint Final Assessment Report relative to procedure no. EMEA/H/C/002315/R/0041 dated 14 November 
2019.  The  MAH  stated  during  the  renewal  that  a  D4200C00104  CSR  can  only  be  produced  once  the 
Agency  agrees  that  the  SOB001  is  lifted/considered  fulfilled,  since  at  that  point  the  clinical  study 
database can be locked, and this was supported by the CHMP. 
6.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
6.1.  Study D4200C0104 
Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Study D4200C00104 is an international, multicenter, non-interventional (observational), prospective (for 
patients with RET mutation positive or negative status) and retrospective (for patients with RET mutation 
negative  status)  study  of  patients  with  symptomatic,  aggressive,  sporadic,  unresectable,  locally 
advanced/metastatic MTC, treated with vandetanib 300 mg once daily and with a RET mutation positive 
or negative status. In addition, patients with symptomatic, aggressive, sporadic, unresectable, locally 
advanced/metastatic MTC not prescribed vandetanib 300 mg but who are RET mutation negative will be 
allowed to enter the study. 
The decision to prescribe vandetanib is taken independently of the enrollment into this study and is in 
line  with  the  respective  (local)  prescribing  information.  The  study  is  observational,  meaning  that 
vandetanib treatment initiation should never be delayed in order to meet any inclusion criteria of the 
study. Similarly, performing interventions on the patients that would specifically be for the study and 
would  not  be  carried  out  in  the  "real  life"  setting  is  not  permitted  e.g.,  a  biopsy.  European  countries 
where vandetanib is on the market (from February 2012) will participate in the study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/30610/2023  
Page 14/94 
 
 
 
Twenty to 25 RET mutation positive and as many RET mutation negative patients as possible are planned 
to be enrolled in the study according to the MAH as described in the clinical overview. 
The objectives of the study are: 
−  To determine the objective response rate (ORR) for patients treated with vandetanib who are RET 
mutation positive and patients treated with vandetanib who are RET mutation negative. 
−  To  determine  the  disease  control  rate  (DCR)  for  patients  treated  with  vandetanib  who  are  RET 
mutation positive and patients treated with vandetanib who are RET mutation negative. 
−  To assess the duration of response and time to response for patients treated with vandetanib who 
are RET mutation positive and patients treated with vandetanib who are RET mutation negative. 
−  To  explore  the  clinical  outcomes  (including  but  not  limited  to  progression-free  survival  [PFS]  and 
ORR) amongst RET mutation negative patients not treated with vandetanib. 
−  Safety, including relevant adverse events (AEs) based on the safety profile outlined in the vandetanib 
summary of product characteristics (SmPC), and incidence of QTc prolongation and associated risks 
for  QTc  prolongation  in  patients  receiving  vandetanib  who  are  RET  mutation  positive  and  RET 
mutation negative. In addition, the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) and AEs leading to 
discontinuation of vandetanib will be assessed. 
−  To  compare  PFS  for  patients  treated  with  vandetanib  who  are  RET  mutation  positive  to  patients 
treated with vandetanib who are RET mutation negative. 
Study visits will include a screening visit and/or enrollment visit, where the eligibility of the prospective 
patient will be confirmed, plus additional follow up visits: 
− 
Investigators  are  strongly  recommended to perform  a  complete  disease  assessment  (biomarkers, 
symptoms, and imaging) at least every 6 months according to both site normal clinical practice and 
International MTC guidelines. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 will be used 
as a base for calculation for disease assessment. 
For retrospective patients (only advanced/metastatic MTC patients with RET mutation negative status): 
−  Data  collection  reporting  time  points  will  include  a  baseline  time  point  before  the  start  of  their 
treatment  for  MTC  (vandetanib  or  another  treatment)  where  the  eligibility  of  the  patient  will  be 
confirmed, plus all subsequent time points that may be available in the patient file. 
All  AEs  for  patients  treated  with  vandetanib  will  be  collected  actively  throughout  the  study,  and 
retrospectively for retrospective RET mutation negative patients. 
Patients will be followed until objective progression, death, or until the end of study (whichever occurs 
first). End of study is defined as 14 months after the last patient has been enrolled in the study and 
when at least 10 PFS events (defined as disease progression based on RECIST 1.1 assessment, or death) 
in both treatment groups have been observed. If all patients have progressed prior to 14 months after 
the last patient is recruited, the study will stop. 
Results 
The  present  addendum  to  Clinical  Overview  (ACO)  follows  the  Interim  Report  dated  24  July  2019, 
submitted as part of the Annual Renewal of the conditional marketing authorization application procedure 
no. EMEA/H/C/002315/R/0041 on 02 August 2020, and reflects updated data as of 10 February 2020. 
The  MAH  notes  that  the  D4200C00104  study  data  presented  in  the  following  section  are  a  raw  data 
extraction  performed on  10  February  2020  in  accordance  with  the  Agency’s  agreement that the  MAH 
would provide data in Q1 2020. Final conclusions from this study are pending the final statistical analysis 
(to  be  performed  at  the  time  of  CSR  preparation).  Since  these  are  raw  data  extractions,  without

consistency checks and statistical analyses as they will be presented the final CSR, the MAH states that 
it is not possible to discuss the limitations of these data in the present Addendum to Clinical Overview, 
and these data should be interpreted with caution. 
Recruitment over time 
As of 10 February 2020 (the cut-off date for this extraction), 40 patients underwent formal screening, 
of whom 35 patients have been prospectively enrolled; there have also been 5 screen failures (3 patients 
had  no  RET  mutation  data  available  [1  of  whom  also  had  no  measurable lesions],  1  patient  was  RET 
positive  but  did  not  meet  the  vandetanib  requirements  of  inclusion  criterion  06,  and  1  RET  positive 
patient had a contraindication to vandetanib). Of the 35 prospectively enrolled patients, 28 patients are 
RET mutation positive and 7 are RET mutation negative (please note that 2 of the 9 patients reported as 
RET negative in the Interim Report submitted in 2019 [dated 24 July 2019 and submitted in the Annual 
Renewal on 02 August 2019] were identified as RET negative due to data entry errors; their mutation 
status was corrected by the investigators as per source documentation, and these patients are reported 
as RET positive in this report). 
In addition, 5 RET mutation negative patients have been retrospectively enrolled. 
Figure 1 provides quarterly and cumulative enrollment data for prospective patients from study inception 
to 10 February 2020, and cumulative enrollment data for retrospective patients since the first country 
approval of the D4200C00104 amendment (Germany, 27 August 2019) up to 10 February 2020. The 
enrollment dates of individual prospective and retrospective patients are provided in Table 2 and Table 
3, respectively. 
A total of 30 sites in 8 countries are participating, including 3 sites involved in the retrospective data 
collection effort on RET negative patients specifically. Among the 30 sites, 7 sites responded that they 
did  not  have  any  RET  patient  to  contribute  to  the  retrospective  data  collection  effort.

Patient disposition (prospectively enrolled patients) 
As  of  the  date  of  data  extraction,  12  patients  remain  in  the  study.  Twenty-one  patients  discontinued 
study treatment early: 10 due to disease progression, 5 due to lack of therapeutic response, 5 due to 
AEs (2 patients due to cutaneous rash, 1 patient due to acute kidney injury, 1 patient due to empyema, 
and 1 patient due to an unspecified AE), and 1 due to patient decision. Two patients died (resulting from 
disease progression), see also Table 4.

Thirty-five (35) patients have been prospectively enrolled to date. No issues have been noted with regard 
to  treatment  compliance,  compliance  with  efficacy  and  safety  assessments  or  important  protocol 
deviations. In addition, 5 patients have been retrospectively enrolled to date. 
Baseline characteristics 
A total of 35 patients have been prospectively enrolled as of the cut-off date for this report. The median 
age of patients enrolled to date is 54 years (range 20 to 85 years). Twenty (57.1%) patients are male; 
15 (42.9%) are female. Most patients (88.6%) are white. Mutations of the RET gene were reported in 
28 of the 35 (80.0%) prospectively enrolled patients to date; 7 (20.0%) prospectively enrolled patients 
are RET negative. 
Additionally, there are a total of 5 patients enrolled retrospectively as of the cut-off date for this report. 
All  were  white,  80%  were  male,  ranged  in  age  from  33  to  67,  and  all  were  RET  mutation  negative. 
Demographics for all patients are summarized in Table 5. 
All  patients  prospectively  and  retrospectively  enrolled  in  study  D4200C00104  were  treated  with 
vandetanib.

Efficacy evaluation 
As of the data cut-off date for this data extraction, results for the primary study objectives (ORR, DCR, 
time to response, and duration of response) are presented in Table 6. Of note, as of the time of this 
report these data are preliminary and monitoring and reconciliation activities are continuing. For instance, 
some patients are still alive, and for some patients the assessments are not yet reported. Therefore, the 
raw data presented below should be interpreted with caution. 
The duration follow-up was based on the time between the date of last RECIST assessment and date of 
informed  consent  (prospective  patients)  or  the  first  dose  date  (retrospective  patients).  The  median 
duration of follow-up for RET positive (n=28) and all RET negative (n=12) patients was 635 days (range: 
95-1829 days) and 1088 days (range: 85-2510 days), respectively. Of note, the duration of follow-up 
for 2 of the 5 RET negative retrospectively enrolled patients is not available; for one patient, there were 
no RECIST assessments entered into the database, and for the other, one RECIST assessment is available 
but it was made prior to the first dose of vandetanib. 
The objective response rate (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]) for RET positive patients 
was 21.4%, while none of the RET negative patients achieved a response; for RET positive patients, the 
median time to response was 231.0 days (range: 112-598 days), and the median duration of response 
was 519.5 days (range: 176-943 days). 
The disease control rate (CR, PR, or stable disease [SD] lasting at least 24 weeks) was apparently not 
different  for  RET  positive  and  RET  negative  patients  (53.6%  versus  50.0%,  respectively).

Discussion 
At  time  of  marketing  authorisation,  a  CMA  was  granted  because  of  the  lack  of  knowledge  allowing 
adequate  B/R  determination  in  RET  negative  patients.  In  order  to  confirm  the  efficacy  and  safety  of 
vandetanib, study D4200C00104 was proposed to gain more information on RET negative patients. 
In 2017 the MAH submitted a type II variation with data from study D4200C00104 with the goal to fulfil 
the SOB and switch to a full approval (EMEA/H/C/002315/II/0028). The CHMP however considered the 
data too limited to draw conclusions with the inclusion of 26 RET positive and 8 RET negative patients 
(of which 4 were still on treatment). ORR was 19.2% in the RET positive and 0% in the RET negative 
population, with DCR in both groups around 50%. Due to recruitment issues it was decided to adjust the 
SOB and the study protocol (sample size of 20-25 RET positive and 20-25 RET negative patients). In 
order to increase recruitment in the RET negative study population, a retrospective part was added in 
the study. The study protocol and RMP were adjusted accordingly. 
During  the  renewal  in  2019,  the  MAH  reported  that  9  RET  negative  patients  were  included  in  study 
D4200C00104 as of May 2019. The CHMP stated in the assessment report that at the time of submission 
of  the  type  II  variation  to  fulfill  the  SOB,  data  from  20  to  25  RET  negative  patients  treated  with 
vandetanib  included  in  the  D4200C00104  study,  prospectively  as  well  as  retrospectively,  should  be 
available.  
In the current procedure, 28 RET positive and 7 RET negative patients were included prospectively as of 
February 2020. It is noted that 2 patients were wrongly coded as RET negative during the data provided 
at the renewal and therefore the number of RET negative patients in the prospective study part is lower. 
Three of the 7 RET negative patients are still receiving treatment with vandetanib. In addition, 5 RET 
negative patients were included retrospectively. Data should be interpreted with caution since the data 
are raw and are not from a planned interim analysis. It is noted that for some patients the assessments 
are not yet reported. ORR was reported to be 21.4% in the RET positive population and 0% in the RET 
negative population. DCR was 53.6% versus 50.0%, respectively. PFS results were not provided. 
In conclusion, in total 12 RET negative patients were included in study D4200C00104 and none of the 
patients showed an anti-tumour response. The number of patients is very limited and conclusions are 
therefore difficult to draw. The fact that the data are raw add to the difficulties interpreting the results. 
According to study protocol 20-25 RET negative patients were to be included, which was also reported 
by the CHMP in the assessment report of the renewal in 2019. The number is therefore lower than as 
agreed, but it is recognised that it is unlikely to complete the recruitment of 20-25 RET negative patients 
in this study given the recruitment rates and that the major referring sites in Europe are participating in 
the study according to the MAH. It can therefore be supported to close study  D4200C00104, but the 
SOB is not considered fulfilled based on the raw data presented. The SOB currently states that the MAH 
should submit the clinical study report of study D4200C00104. In order to properly assess the data, this 
should include the final clinical study report and the MAH is requested to provide the final CSR within the 
current  procedure.  The  final  CSR  was  provided  by  the  MAH  in  the  first  round  of  responses  (see 
“Responses to the request for supplementary information 1”).

Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Study  D4200C00058  was  an  international,  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  multicenter, 
phase 3 study designed to assess whether vandetanib (300 mg daily) improves PFS compared to placebo 
in  patients  with  unresectable  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  MTC.  Patients  were  randomised  in  a  2:1 
ratio  to  receive  vandetanib  300  mg,  once  daily  oral  dose  or  matched  placebo,  continuing  on  blinded 
treatment until they had objective disease progression, provided they did not meet any other withdrawal 
criteria. Upon disease progression, patients were discontinued from blinded study treatment and then 
unblinded  and  given  the  option  to  begin  open  label  treatment  with  vandetanib  300  mg  (or  receive  a 
permanently reduced dose, if applicable), or entered follow-up for survival status. 
Based on the assay technology available at the time the study was run, 56.5% of patients were found 
to be RET positive, 2.4% were RET negative, and 41.1% had an unknown RET mutation status due to 
the limitations of the assay. 
As explained in the response document submitted on 20 December 2018, as part of variation procedure 
no. EMEA/H/C/002315/II/0028 (sequence 0114), to more reliably determine the true mutation status 
for the patients recruited in the original trial, an extensive molecular analyses of the MTC tumor samples 
would be performed and the results would be correlated with clinical data to determine whether there 
are  significant  relationships  between  molecular  data  and  clinical  outcomes.  In  particular,  this  tumor 
sample  re-analysis  is  aimed  to  reclassify  previously  reported  RET  unknown  patients  and  provide 
vandetanib efficacy and safety data according to their newly assessed RET status. 
The overall objectives of this tumor sample re-analysis are: 
−  To  perform  a  comprehensive  molecular  and  genetic  characterization  of  MTC  tissue  collected  from 
patients participating in the D4200C00058 Study, to determine if there are previously undiscovered 
genetic mutations or chromosomal rearrangements present in the RET-negative and RET-unknown 
samples. 
−  To perform a genotype-phenotype correlation comparing the results of the molecular studies with 
the clinical course of individual patients participating in the D4200C00058 Study, and to determine 
if there are significant relationships between the molecular data and the clinical outcome data from 
patients participating in the D4200C00058 Study; so that the efficacy of vandetanib can be evaluated 
in the RET-negative groups.

In  study  D4200C00058,  of  331  patients,  287  (86.7%)  had  sporadic  MTC,  33  (10.0%)  patients  had 
hereditary MTC, and 11 (3.3%) patients had unknown status. RET mutation status was determined to 
be positive in 187 (56.5%) patients, negative in 8 patients (2.4%), and unknown in 136 (41.1%) patients 
due to insufficient tumor DNA to fulfill stringent testing criteria. 
The aim of this analysis is to reclassify the RET status of the available previously RET unknown and RET 
negative samples with new methodologies and to assess efficacy and safety in the RET negative patients. 
For the reassessment of study D4200C00058, samples histology slides of residual tumor tissue from the 
clinical trial were reviewed and tumor containing regions were identified and marked by a pathologist. 
In a subset of samples with normal areas were identified for comparison with the tumor material. DNA

was extracted using standard methods. RET genotyping of the extracted DNA was carried out with one 
of the following platforms. Initially, some samples were genotyped for the RET M918T mutation using a 
custom Taqman assay. Samples with scant material were not analyzed further. Samples with adequate 
material  were  sequenced  using  Illumina  technology  to  reveal  any  other  RET  mutations.  Bar  coded 
sequencing  libraries  were  made  from  the  tissue  DNA.  RET  sequences  were  enriched  using  a  custom 
Agilent SureSelect reagent and sequenced on an Illumina sequencer. Some samples went through the 
Illumina analysis more than once. Data processing and automated calling of RET variants was carried 
out using the Broad Genome Analysis ToolKit (GATK) pipeline with manual curation of any difficult cases 
using Broad Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV). 
Two different analyses were performed, the first analysis included all patients with RET status assessed 
with newer methodologies. For this first analysis, results were presented according to RET status (RET 
positive,  RET  negative/RAS  negative/BRAF  negative,  RET  negative/RAS  positive,  RET  negative/BRAF 
positive, all RET negative). Demographic and safety data were provided. Safety data included the AEs; 
and for the patient incidence of AEs, the frequencies and percentages are presented. The safety summary 
tables show the patients’ data while on randomized treatment, while on open label treatment, and while 
on randomized and open label treatment. 
The second analysis included all RET positive patients and only RET negative patients assessed with the 
newer methodologies. For this last analysis efficacy data were provided and presented according to RET 
status and by treatment arm. The efficacy data included the primary endpoint, the PFS as well as the 
ORR and DCR. The median PFS were provided for each RET status and treatment arm where calculable, 
and  in  addition,  the  proportion  of  patients  who  had  PFS  at  6  months,  1  year  and  2  years  after 
randomisation was summarized by RET status and treatment arm. For the ORR, DCR, the frequencies 
and 
percentages 
are 
presented. 
Results 
Results of re-analysis (73 samples) 
The available RET mutation status “unknown” samples (n=67), previously RET negative samples (n=2), 
and  previously  RET  positive  (n=4)  were  analyzed  with  the  methodologies  described.  The  remaining 
previously RET mutation status “unknown” samples (n= 69) and RET negative samples (n=6) could not 
be re-analyzed due to unavailability of the samples and therefore excluded from this analysis. 
The  reanalysis  confirmed  the  four  previously  RET  positive  patients  to  be  RET  positive,  and  1  of  2 
previously RET negative patient was found to be RET positive. Out of the 67 RET unknown patients re-
analyzed, 52 were reclassified as RET positive and 15 were found to be RET negative. In total, 17 patients 
were found to be RET negative. Two of the RET negative patients were also RAS and BRAF negative, 
while  1  was  BRAF  positive  and  14  were  RAS  positive.  Eleven  of  the  RET  negative  patients  received 
vandetanib  during  the  double-blind  treatment  and  6  received  placebo,  while  11  received  vandetanib 
during the open label phase. 
The demographics of the reclassified patients according to RET, RAS and BRAF status are summarized 
in Table 7.

Results of efficacy analysis of 73 samples re-analyzed 
The number (%) of patients with events (e.g., RECIST progression or death) were 44.6% for RET positive 
and 23.5% for RET negative. The median PFS in RET negative patients could not be calculated because 
an insufficient number of PFS events had occurred in the RET negative patients group at the time of data 
cut-off; 
the  median  PFS 
in 
the  RET  positive  patients  group  was  21.1  months. 
Results of efficacy analysis of study D4200C00058 
In this efficacy analysis the RET positive patients (n=239) include the RET positive patients from Study 
D4200C00058 trial (n=187) and the newly found RET positive patients from this reanalysis (n=56) while 
the RET negative patients only include the RET negative patients found by this reanalysis (n=17). RET - 
includes patients who are RET - / RAS - / BRAF - (n=2), patients who are RET - / RAS + (n=14), and 
patients who are RET - / BRAF + (n=1). 
In the vandetanib arm, the median PFS for the RET positive patients and RET negative was not calculable. 
The number of events seems to be lower in vandetanib arm (34.9% for RET positive patients and 9.1% 
for  RET  negative  patients)  than  in  placebo  arm  (56.7%  for  RET  positive  patients  and  50.0%  for  RET 
negative patients) in both RET status subgroup patients. The percentage of patients progression-free or 
alive at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years on vandetanib were respectively 90.9%, 83.3%, and 55.7% in 
the RET positive patients, and 90%, 90%, and 90% in the RET negative patients (see Table 8). 
In the vandetanib arm, 51.7% (n=89) RET positive patients and 18.2% (n=2) RET negative patients 
had an ORR measured by RECIST. DCR was 86.6% (n=149) in the RET positive group and 72.7% (n=8) 
in the RET negative group (see Table 9).

Discussion 
Of note, the results described above were reported previously to the CHMP (EMEA/H/C/002315/R/0041). 
In this part of the SOB, the MAH reanalysed samples of study D4200C00058 to provide a more accurate 
RET  status  based  on  current  methodologies  which  were  unavailable  at  the  time  of  MAA.  In  total,  17 
patients were found to be RET negative with the reanalysis. Two of the RET negative patients were also 
RAS  and  BRAF  negative,  while  one  was  BRAF  positive  and  14  were  RAS  positive.  Eleven  of  the  RET 
negative patients received vandetanib during the double-blind treatment and 6 received placebo. 
In 73 re-analysed samples median PFS could not be calculated, the number of patients with an event 
were 44.6% in the RET positive and 23.5% in the RET negative population. 
Next, the MAH performed an analysis with the RET positive patients (n=239) including the RET positive 
patients  from  study  D4200C00058  (n=187)  and  the  newly  found  RET  positive  patients  from  this 
reanalysis (n=56) while the RET negative patients only include the RET negative patients found by this 
reanalysis (n=17). Again, median PFS could not be calculated. The number of events was 34.9% in the 
RET positive group and 9.1% for the RET negative group treated with vandetanib (numbers in placebo 
group were 56.7% vs 50.0%, respectively). ORR in patients treated with vandetanib was 51.7% in the 
RET positive group and 18.2% in the RET negative group. In patients who received placebo, in 14.9% a 
response was reported in the RET positive group, and no objective responses were observed in the 6 
RET negative patients. DCR was 86.6% in the RET positive group and 72.7% in the RET negative group 
treated  with  vandetanib.  In  the  placebo  group  these  numbers  were  67.2  vs  100%,  respectively.  The 
number of RET negative patients is very low and conclusions are difficult to draw, but there seems to be 
some  anti-tumour  activity  in  two  RET  negative,  RAS  positive  tumours.  However,  results  remain 
inconclusive given the limited data available. As the MAH provided the requested data, this part of the 
SOB is considered fulfilled.

7.  Clinical Safety aspects 
7.1.  Study D4200C0104 
Results 
Cumulatively  through  10  February  2020,  314  AEs  at  any  grade  have  been  reported  in  Study 
D4200C00104 in 35 patients (including both prospectively and retrospectively enrolled patients). A total 
of 201 AEs were considered to be related to the investigational product. The majority of events (94.6%) 
were reported as mild to moderate in severity grade. 
Treatment-emergent  AEs  (TEAEs)  were  reported  in  35  patients  (87.5%);  an  overview  of  patients 
reporting TEAEs is provided in Table 10. The most commonly reported system organ classes ([SOCs] 
≥10.0% of patients) were skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (55.0%), gastrointestinal disorders 
(52.5%),  investigations  (42.5%),  infections  and  infestations  (40.0%),  metabolism  and  nutrition 
disorders (37.5%), general disorders and administration site conditions (35.0%), musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders (25.0%), vascular disorders (22.5%), renal and urinary disorders (20.0%), 
nervous system disorders (17.5%), psychiatric disorders (12.5%), blood and lymphatic system disorders 
(10.0%),  eye  disorders  (10.0%),  and  respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders  (10.0%).  Most 
patients (57.5%) reported mild or moderate severity as the worst TEAE severity they experienced. 
A total of 9 patients (22.5%) reported 14 SAEs, of which 4 SAEs (reported in 3 patients [7.5%]) were 
considered  related  to  Investigational  Medicinal  Product  (IMP):  1  patient  experienced  moderate  QTc 
prolongation, 1 patient experienced severe diarrhoea, and 1 patient experienced moderate nausea and 
severe Clostridium difficile infection. All SAEs related to IMP resolved following drug interruption. Other 
SAEs (not related to IMP) included pneumonia, gastroenteritis, cholecystitis, disease progression, bone 
pain,  malignant  tumor  masses,  pyelonephritis,  vomiting,  and  multiple  pulmonary  aspergillomas.  One 
RET positive patient (2.5%) experienced a SAE of disease progression (not related to IMP) that led to 
death. 
A  total  of  8  patients  (20.0%)  had  a  TEAE  leading  to  treatment  discontinuation  (whereas  5  patients 
stopped treatment due to AE as listed in Table 4; data cleaning is ongoing and the action taken for the 
AE will be corrected for the other 3 patients). 
Overall,  96.4% of  RET  positive  patients  and 66.7%  of  RET  negative  patients experienced  TEAEs,  and 
28.6% and 8.3% patients experienced SAEs in RET positive and negative patients, respectively. 
A summary of TEAEs by SOC and preferred term (PT) and RET mutation status is provided in Section 
7.1.3.1 of the Addendum to Clinical Overview.

Discussion 
Numerically, TEAEs and SAEs occurred less often in RET negative versus RET positive patients, although 
the small sample size of patients with RET negative status hamper the assessment. The reported safety 
profile in study D4200C00104 does not raise new safety signals.

Discussion 
Again, the low number of patients in the RET negative group make it difficult to compare with the RET 
positive subgroup. It seems that vandetanib treatment is at least not more toxic in RET negative patients 
compared to RET positive patients.

7.3.  Direct Healthcare Professional Communication 
A Direct Healthcare Professional Communication (DHPC) is considered necessary in order to 
communicate on available data from data from the randomized study D4500C00058, and the 
observational study OBS14778, showing insufficient activity of vandetanib in patients with no identified 
RET mutations. 
The  (Co-)Rapporteur’s  comments  on  the  DHPC  and  the  draft  communication  plan  are  provided  in 
Attachment 2. 
The MAH should agree the translations and local specificities of the DHPC with national competent 
authorities. The DHPC should be sent upon receipt of the Commission Decision with the revised SmPC 
with the changes highlighted to relevant healthcare professionals (healthcare professionals involved in 
prescribing and handling Of Caprelsa (vandetanib)). 
7.4.  PSUR cycle  
Considering the marketing authorisation will no longer be subject to specific obligations, the CHMP is of 
the  opinion  that  the  already  existing  entry  in  the  EURD  list  for  vandetanib  needs  to  be  amended  as 
follows: the PSUR cycle for the medicinal product should follow a yearly cycle. 
8.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this variation, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are being updated. The 
Package Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly. 
Changes are made to the Opinion Annex II conditions as detailed in the recommendations section 
above. 
In addition, black triangle and additional monitoring statements are being removed. 
Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information. 
8.1.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(3) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Caprelsa (vandetanib) is removed from the 
additional monitoring list once the conditions have been fulfilled. 
Therefore, the statement that this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this 
will allow quick identification of new safety information, preceded by an inverted equilateral black 
triangle, is removed from the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet. 
9.  RMP 
The MAH did not provide an updated RMP but committed to provide the updated RMP in another variation 
upon approval of the current type II labelling variation at the next regulatory opportunity.

Question 1 
Given the recruitment rates, it seems that including 20-25 RET negative patients will not be feasible in 
a reasonable time frame. It can therefore be supported to close study D4200C00104, but the SOB cannot 
be considered fulfilled based on the raw data presented. In order to properly assess the data, this should 
include the final clinical study report and the MAH is requested to provide the final CSR within the current 
procedure. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The MAH is providing the Agency with the final Clinical Study Report (CSR) of study OBS14778 (also 
named study D4200C00104) in accordance with the timelines agreed in June 2020 in the frame of this 
procedure.  The  main  information  for  the  CSR  will  be  reported  below  the  summary  of  the  Applicant’s 
response. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/30610/2023  
Page 31/94 
 
 
 
The CSR conclusion is that, although RET negative patients showed a lower objective tumor response 
than RET positive patients, DCR and PFS were comparable between both groups. There was a slightly 
higher rate of AEs and serious TEAEs among the RET positive patients compared to the RET negative. 
Overall, reported AEs are consistent with the known safety profile of vandetanib. Considering the results 
and  limitations  of  this  observational  study,  the  positive  benefit/risk  profile  of  vandetanib  already 
established in RET positive patients is confirmed and is considered acceptable in RET negative patients 
with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic MTC. Overall, the benefit-risk balance of vandetanib 
remains thus positive in the currently approved indication of use, regardless of the RET status. 
In addition to the CSR, as proposed in December 2018 (in the frame of Response to RSI dated 18-Oct-
2018  -  procedure  no.  EMEA/H/C/002315/II/0028),  the  MAH  also  reviewed  the  benefit-risk  ratio  of 
vandetanib in the RET negative patient population, considering the evaluation of treatment efficacy and 
safety of vandetanib in RET negative patients based on compiled data compared to patients not treated 
with vandetanib. The MAH assesses that the benefit-risk balance of vandetanib is positive in the currently 
approved indications of use regardless of the RET status based on the B/R analysis below. 
Medical need and important alternative 
Epidemiology: MTC is a rare cancer 
Thyroid  cancer  was  responsible  for  586,202  new  cases  and  44,000  deaths  in  2020  (1).  The  global 
incidence rate is 3-fold higher in women than men and varies widely from country to country, with the 
highest figures (per 100,000 person-years) being reported in Micronesia/Polynesia (18.5), North America 
(18.4) Eastern Asia (17.8), Southern Europe (16.5) and Australia/New Zealand (15.3). Mortality rates 
are also higher in women (0.5) than men (0.3) with highest figures reported in North America (6.3), 
Australia/New Zealand (5.6), Eastern Asia (5.4) and Southern Europe (5.1) (1). 
While the incidence of differentiated thyroid cancer has regularly increased during the last three decades, 
the incidence of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) remains quite stable, accounting for only 2.1% of thyroid 
cancers  (2,  3).  MTC  is  a  relatively  indolent  tumor  with  a  10-year  overall  survival  (OS)  rate  of 
approximately  75%  to  80%  (4).  However,  patients  with  unresectable,  locally  advanced  or  metastatic 
MTC have limited therapeutic options, and their 10-year OS rate is not exceeding 40% (4). 
Molecular alterations in MTC: RET mutation negative MTC is very rare 
MTC is a rare form of neuroendocrine tumor which originates from calcitonin-producing parafollicular C 
cells  (3).  The  majority  (75%)  of  cases  occur  sporadically  and  in  remaining 25%  cases,  it  is  inherited 
through germline mutation. Almost all patients with inherited MTC have germline mutations in proto-
oncogene  encoding  the  tyrosine  kinase  receptor  rearranged  during  transfection  (RET).  This  results  in 
constitutive activation of the RET tyrosine kinase. In sporadic MTC, about half of the mutations occur in 
RET gene which is associated with more aggressive disease and a worse prognosis (3). RET mutation 
negative MTC patient population is very rare. Sporadic MTC usually occurs between the age of 40 and 
60 years (5). 
Management of MTC 
Demonstration of calcitonin (CTN) expression is mandatory for the diagnostic of MTC (2). Determination 
of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels may also be useful. Monitoring of both CTN and CEA monitoring 
is recommended in patients with MTC. 
Owing  to  limited  responsiveness  to  non-surgical  treatments  (radioactive  iodine  therapy,  external 
radiotherapy,  and  conventional  chemotherapy),  targeted  therapy  with  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors 
(vandetanib, cabozantinib) represent an important therapeutic option for first-line treatment of patients 
with advanced MTC (6).

International guidelines 
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guideline for Thyroid Carcinoma 
version 3.2020 (7) recommends the following: 
•  Surgical resection of MTC is the primary treatment. 
• 
For unresectable, recurrent or symptomatic and progressing disease consider systemic therapy: 
−  Preferred  regimens  are  vandetanib  (Category  1),  cabozantinib  (Category  1),  selpercatinib  (if 
RET-mutation positive), pralsetinib (if RET-mutation positive); vandetanib or cabozantinib can 
be used as first-line or second-line therapy. 
− 
In certain circumstances pembrolizumab can be considered. 
The  European  Society  for  Medical  Oncology  (ESMO)  Clinical  Practice  Guideline  for  Thyroid  Cancer  (2) 
recommends the following: 
•  Surgical resection of MTC is the primary treatment. 
• 
For  symptomatic  and  advanced/metastatic  MTC,  first-line  therapy  includes  vandetanib  [I,  A]  and 
• 
• 
• 
cabozantinib [I, A]. Choice of treatment depends on potential toxicity to each patient. 
In  patients  with  RETM918T  or  RAS-mutant  MTC,  cabozantinib  offers  significant  PFS  and  OS 
advantages over wild-type MTC [II, C]. 
There is little evidence to support the use of either chemotherapy or radionuclide therapy in patients 
with MTC, although either might be considered when multikinase inhibitors are contra-indicated. 
There is currently no evidence supporting the value of routine screening of MTC patients for somatic 
RET mutations. However, if treatment of advanced MTC with selective RET inhibitors is planned, RET 
testing is needed to individualize therapy. 
The American Thyroid Association Guidelines for the Management of Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma (8) 
recommends the following: 
•  Surgical resection of MTC is the primary treatment. 
• 
In  patients  with  significant  tumor  burden  and  symptomatic  or  progressive  metastatic  disease 
according  to  RECIST  (Response  Evaluation  Criteria  in  Solid  Tumours)  criteria,  vandetanib  or 
cabozantinib can be used as single-agent first-line systemic therapy (Grade A recommendation). 
Recent literature 
In  addition,  recently  published  following  studies  (including  real-world  evidence)  support  therapeutic 
position of vandetanib in the treatment of MTC.

Newly identified information on efficacy and/or effectiveness 
Two new studies evaluating the activity and safety of vandetanib in RET negative patients have become 
recently available and are summarized below: 
The non-interventional post-authorization safety study (PASS) OBS14778: International Observational 
Study to Evaluate the Benefit/Risk of Vandetanib (Caprelsa™) 300 mg in RET Mutation Negative and RET 
Mutation  Positive  Patients  with  Symptomatic,  Aggressive,  Sporadic,  Unresectable,  Locally 
Advanced/Metastatic Medullary Thyroid Cancer (CSR provided) 
Methods: OBS14778 was a multinational, multicenter, non-interventional study conducted to fulfill the 
post authorization specific obligation linked to the conditional marketing authorization of vandetanib. It 
was aimed at confirming the benefit/risk of vandetanib 300 mg in real-life conditions, both in rearranged 
during  transfection  (RET)  mutation  negative  and  RET  positive  patients  with  symptomatic,  aggressive, 
sporadic, unresectable, locally advanced/metastatic MTC. Due to slow recruitment (owing to very rare 
availability  of  RET  negative  patients  and  lack  of  RET  mutation  status  evaluation  prior  to  treatment  in 
routine  clinical  practice)  and  as  agreed  with  the  EMA,  the  protocol  was  amended  to  also  allow 
retrospective enrollment of RET negative patients at study sites. The prospective and retrospective data 
collection was also enriched with patients from the randomized phase III study D4200C00058 who had 
an initially unknown RET status and were subsequently classified RET positive or RET negative following 
re-analysis of archived tumor samples. 
The primary outcome was the objective response rate (ORR) based on RECIST criteria. Other outcomes 
included, disease control rate, progression-free survival (PFS), CTN and CEA serum levels and toxicities. 
There was no central review of imaging in the prospective and retrospective cohorts. 
Results:  Overall,  97  patients  were  enrolled  (40  RET  positive  or  RET  negative  patients  recruited 
prospectively,  10  RET  negative  patients  recruited  retrospectively,  47  patients  with  RET  status  newly 
determined  from  Study  D4200C00058).  Of  them,  91  patients  were  exposed  to  vandetanib  and  75 
patients were evaluable for effectiveness. Of these 75 patients, 55 were RET positive and 20 were RET 
negative,  47  (63%)  were  females,  63  (84%)  had  prior  thyroidectomy  and  62  (84%)  had  distant 
metastasis at enrollment. 
•  Median  duration  of  vandetanib  treatment  was  23.4  months  in  RET  positive  patients  versus  27.6 
months in RET negative patients. 
•  All  patients  were  evaluable  for  tumor  response.  Of  the  55  RET  positive  patients,  2  (3.6%)  had  a 
confirmed complete response, 21 (38.2%) had a confirmed partial response and 24 (43.6%) had a 
confirmed stable disease, corresponding to an overall response rate (ORR) of 41.8% and a disease 
control rate (DCR) of 85.5%. Of the 20 RET negative patients, one patient (5%) had a confirmed 
partial response and 17 patients (85%) had a confirmed stable disease, corresponding to an ORR of 
5% and a DCR of 90%. 
•  During a median follow-up of 27.8 months, 44 patients had disease progression (32 RET positive, 
12 RET negative) and 6 patients died (4 RET positive, 2 RET negative). Median PFS was 24.6 months 
in both RET positive and RET negative patients. At 12 months, 27% of RET positive patients and 23% 
of RET negative patients were estimated to have progressed; at 24 months, 50% of RET positive 
patients and 41% of RET negative patients were estimated to have progressed. Overall survival was 
not mature. 
•  During the treatment with vandetanib, a decrease in calcitonin was achieved at faster rate in RET 
positive than RET negative patients. There was also a decrease in carcinogenic antigen (CEA) which 
was comparable in both RET positive and RET negative patients. 
•  Overall,  91  patients  (64  RET  positive,  27  RET  negative)  were  exposed  to  at  least  one  dose  of 
vandetanib. Reported safety findings were in line with known safety profile of vandetanib. A slightly

higher percentage of RET positive patients compared to RET negative patients experienced treatment 
emergent adverse events (TEAEs, 98.4% versus 88.9%) and serious adverse events (SAEs, 31.3% 
versus  22.2%).  The  most  commonly  reported  treatment  emergent  AEs  included  diarrhea  (56%), 
rash (31.9%), and hypertension (23.1%). Grade 3-4 adverse events were reported by 36 patients 
(27 RET positive, 9 RET negative) and were mainly diarrhea (n=4), rash (n=4), disease progression 
(n=2), dysphagia (n=2) and QTc prolongation (n=2). Vandetanib was discontinued due to adverse 
events in 14 patients (15.4%), mainly due to skin toxicity (n=4), nausea (n=2) and chronic kidney 
disease (n=2). Four patients experienced an adverse event leading to death (disease progression, 
n=2; aspiration, n=1, acute cardiac failure with arrythmia, n=1). 
Conclusions: Considering the limitations of this observational study, the positive benefit/risk profile of 
vandetanib already established in RET positive patients in a pivotal phase III study is confirmed and is 
considered acceptable in RET negative patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic MTC. 
Overall, the benefit-risk balance of vandetanib remains thus positive in the currently approved indication 
of use, regardless of the RET status.

Real-World Multicenter Experience. Endocrinol Metab 2020;35(3): 587-594 (12) 
Background:  Since  only  limited  data  regarding  its  use  outside  clinical  trials  are  available,  this  study 
aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vandetanib in patients with advanced MTC in routine clinical 
practice in Korea. 
Methods: In this multicenter retrospective study, 12 patients with locally advanced or metastatic MTC 
treated with vandetanib at four tertiary hospitals in Korea were included and treated with vandetanib at 
a starting dose of 300 mg/day. The primary outcome was the objective response rate (ORR) based on 
RECIST  criteria.  The  progression-free  survival  (PFS),  overall  survival  (OS),  and  toxicities  were  also 
evaluated. 
Results: All 12 patients had prior thyroidectomy. Of  them, 8 patients were RET negative, one patient 
was RET positive and 3 patients were RET unknown. Eleven patients (92%) had distant metastasis and 
10 (83%) had disease progression at enrollment. 
•  Median duration of vandetanib treatment was 25.3 months. 
•  All patients were evaluable for tumor response. Partial response (PR) was observed in five patients 
(42%) and seven patients (58%) had stable disease which lasted ≥24 weeks in five of them (83%). 
The ORR was thus 42% and the disease control rate (CR+PR+SD lasting ≥24 weeks) was 83%. 
•  During a median follow-up of 31.7 months, disease progression was seen in five patients (42%) and 
two patients died due to disease progression. The median PFS was 25.9 months, while the median 
OS was not reached. 
•  A decrease by ≥50% in serum CTN and CEA levels which was maintained for at least 4 weeks was 
observed in 8 patients (67%). 
•  Most  common  grade  3-4  adverse  events  were  rash  (n=4,  33%),  diarrhea  (n=3,  25%),  mucositis 
(n=2, 17%) and QTc prolongation (n=2, 17%). Four patients had vandetanib dose reductions and 6 
patients had dose interruptions. Vandetanib was discontinued in two patients due to skin toxicity. 
Conclusion:  Consistent  with  the  phase  III  trial,  this  study  which  enrolled  a  majority  of  RET  negative 
patients (67%) confirmed the efficacy of vandetanib for advanced MTC in terms of both ORR and PFS in 
the real-world setting. Vandetanib was well tolerated in the majority of patients, and there were no fatal 
AEs. 
Characterisation of benefits

Based  on  the  data  presented,  vandetanib  is  active  in  the  treatment  of  unresectable,  metastatic  and 
advanced  MTC.  Findings  from  Study  OBS14778  suggests  that  RET  negative  patients  treated  with 
vandetanib have a disease control rate and a PFS comparable to RET positive patients. The ORR was 
lower  in  RET  negative  patients  but  there  was  no  central  review  of  imaging  in  the  prospective  and 
retrospective cohorts. 
Further, the study by Kim et al, 2021 which enrolled in majority RET-negative patients with advanced 
MTC showed an ORR of 42%, and a disease control rate of (83%) and a median PFS of 25.9 months 
(12). 
The available new information suggests that vandetanib is effective regardless of RET status. 
Integrated benefit-risk analysis for approved indications 
Methodology 
A structured systematic approach was applied to vandetanib in treatment of aggressive and symptomatic 
MTC  in  patients  with unresectable  locally  advanced or  metastatic  disease  with  focus  on  RET  negative 
patient population. 
This  assessment  is  based  on  labeling  documents,  sponsored  clinical  trials  and  post-marketing  data 
especially the Study OBS14778 in order to evaluate the benefit-risk profile of vandetanib in RET negative 
population.  Results  presented  were  retrieved  from  the  most  up-to-date  information  from  Study 
OBS14778 regarding the clinical efficacy/effectiveness and all sources of information regarding safety of 
vandetanib. 
The data presentations are based on a descriptive framework developed for benefit-risk decision making 
in  drug  development  and  post-approval  settings.  The  approach  is  meant  to  facilitate  identification  of 
critical issues regarding benefits and risks and improve transparency of the assumptions used by the 
MAH to evaluate the benefit-risk profile. 
The steps from the framework were used to define the main problem to be addressed, i.e. the context 
in  which  a  decision had to  be  made,  to  determine  key  benefits  and  key  risk  outcomes  to  construct  a 
value tree, and to identify the data sources. The descriptive framework emphasizes relevant metrics to 
enable a comprehensive discussion of benefit-risk while providing complete transparency into the origin 
and format of the source data. 
Key  benefits  are  defined  by  favorable  effects  that  contribute  importantly  to  the  overall  benefit  risk 
evaluation and that are important for the patient (clinically important, relevant, intense or durable). The 
key  risks  are  defined  by  unfavorable  effects  that  contribute  importantly  to  the  overall  benefit-risk 
evaluation,  and  not  necessarily  include  all  important  risks  of  the  drug.  The  selection  was  based  on 
medical  judgment  (clinically  important  risks  because  of  their  severity,  frequency,  duration,  toxicity, 
irreversibility, or inability to be predicted or prevented). They may also include those that are considered 
for risk minimization activity beyond labeling. 
Key benefits and risks of vandetanib were organized in a hierarchic manner to construct a “Value Tree”. 
The data presentation consists on a descriptive benefit risk framework table and a “Value Tree”. 
Benefit-risk evaluation 
A value tree providing a concise, visual representation of the key benefits and key risks considered in 
the overall benefit risk assessment is presented below.

The Benefit Risk Assessment table presented below provides an overall summary and assessment of the 
key decision factors that were considered for the benefit risk assessment of vandetanib in treatment of 
aggressive  and  symptomatic  MTC  in  RET  negative  patients  with  unresectable  locally  advanced  or 
metastatic disease.

Benefit-risk conclusion 
Considering the results and limitations of the observational study OBS14778 and all available information 
through  literature,  the  positive  benefit/risk  profile  of  vandetanib  already  established  in  RET  positive 
patients  is  confirmed  and  is  considered  acceptable  in  RET  negative  patients  with  unresectable  locally 
advanced or metastatic MTC. Overall, the benefit-risk balance of vandetanib remains thus positive in the 
currently approved indication of use, regardless of the RET status according to the MAH. 
As a consequence, and taking into account the lack of alternatives for RET negative patients, the MAH 
considers now that the provisions relative to the RET mutation status embedded in section 4.4 ‘Special 
warnings and precautions for use’ should be modified as follows: 
“Rearranged during transfection (RET) status 
Patients  without  RET  mutation  may  have  a  decreased  benefit  from  vandetanib  treatment  and  the 
benefit/risk  balance  for  this  group  of  patients  may  therefore  differ  from  that  of  the  group  with  RET 
mutations. For patients whose RET mutation status could be negative, a possible lower benefit should 
be taken into account before individual treatment decisions and the use of vandetanib should be carefully 
considered  because  of  the  treatment  related  risks.  Therefore,  RET  mutation  testing  is  recommended. 
When  establishing  RET  mutation  status,  tissue  samples  should  be  obtained  if  possible  at  the  time  of 
initiation of treatment rather than at the time of diagnosis (see sections 4.1 and 5.1).” 
In addition, the section 5.1 ‘Pharmacodynamic properties’ of the SmPC is proposed to be modified to 
include the final results of the data analysis (instead of the interim results previously proposed). 
To conclude, the MAH now considers that the SOB001 is fulfilled and can be lifted from the Marketing 
Authorisation in order to convert it from a conditional to a standard MA. The RMP of vandetanib will be 
updated in a second step.

Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Milestones 
OBS14778  was  initiated  as  Study  D4200C00104  (first  patient  in  17  February  2014)  under  the 
Sponsorship  of  AstraZeneca.  Territory  rights  for  the  clinical  development  and  commercialization  of 
vandetanib were granted in 2015 from AstraZeneca to Genzyme Corporation. AstraZeneca had identified 
the participating sites based on their contemporary use of Caprelsa. All appropriate sites had a remote 
Pre-Study  Site  Visit  and  hence  additional  information  on  sites  cannot  be  provided.  Because  the 
D4200C00104 study recruited very slowly (rarity of  RET negative patients with MTC, and lack of RET 
mutation  status  evaluation  prior  to  treatment  in  routine  clinical  practice),  it  was  agreed  with  EMA 
(Amended  Protocol  02,  issued  on  21  June  2019)  that  the  study  population  would  be  enriched  with  2 
other population of patients: 
Firstly, retrospective RET negative patients (only) were allowed to be enrolled in the study. 
• 
•  Secondly, both groups (RET positive and RET negative) would be pooled with patients issued from 
the  randomized  Phase  3  study  (D4200C00058):  the  RET  mutation unknown  patients treated  with 
vandetanib were re-analyzed based on archived tumor samples. Patients recognized as RET negative 
and RET positive would enrich the respective groups. 
In addition, patients with symptomatic, aggressive, sporadic, unresectable, locally advanced/metastatic 
MTC with a negative RET mutation status and treated or not with vandetanib were allowed to enrich both 
prospective and retrospective cohorts. The protocol was amended accordingly on 21 June 2019. 
Objectives 
• 
To determine the Objective Response Rate (ORR) for patients treated with vandetanib who were RET 
mutation positive and patients treated with vandetanib who were RET mutation negative.

• 
• 
• 
• 
To determine the Disease Control Rate (DCR) for patients treated with vandetanib who were RET 
mutation positive and patients treated with vandetanib who were RET mutation negative. 
To assess the duration of response and time to response for patients treated with vandetanib who 
were RET mutation positive and patients treated with vandetanib who were RET mutation negative. 
To explore the clinical outcomes (including, but not limited to, PFS and ORR) among RET mutation 
negative patients not treated with vandetanib. 
To evaluate the incidence of QT (the interval between Q and T on electrocardiogram [ECG]) interval 
corrected  for  heart  rate  (QTc)  prolongation  and  associated  risks  for  QTc  prolongation  in  patients 
receiving vandetanib who were RET mutation positive and RET mutation negative. In addition, the 
incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events (AEs) leading to discontinuation of 
vandetanib was assessed. 
To compare PFS for patients treated with vandetanib who were RET mutation positive to patients 
treated with vandetanib who were RET mutation negative.

Study design 
This  was  a  prospective  multinational,  multicenter,  noninterventional  (observational)  study  of  RET 
positive  and  RET  negative  patients  with  symptomatic,  aggressive,  sporadic,  unresectable,  locally 
advanced/metastatic  MTC  treated  with  Caprelsa  (vandetanib).  Because  recruitment  of  RET  negative 
patients  was  difficult,  patients  with  symptomatic,  aggressive,  sporadic,  unresectable,  locally 
advanced/metastatic  MTC  treated  or  not  with  vandetanib  and  who  were  RET  mutation  negative  were 
also retrospectively recruited at study sites. In addition, a total of 47 patients from the pivotal study 
D4200C00058  with  re-analyzed  RET  status  (either  positive  or  negative)  were  included,  as  described 
below.

The decision to prescribe vandetanib was made independently of the enrollment into this study and was 
in line with the respective (local) prescribing information. 
The  study  was  observational,  meaning  that  vandetanib  treatment  initiation  should  have  never  been 
delayed to meet any inclusion criteria of the study. Similarly, performing interventions on the patients 
that were specific for the study and would not have been carried out in the "real-life" setting was not 
permitted  (eg,  a  biopsy).  European  countries  where  vandetanib  is  on  the  market  (from  2012) 
participated in the study. 
Data  collection  and  reporting  were  performed  until  objective  progression,  or  until  the  end  of  study 
(whichever occurred first). For prospective patients included in OBS14778, the end of study was defined 
as 14 months after the last prospective patient was enrolled in the study and when at least 10 events in 
each treatment group had been observed. If all patients had progressed prior to 14 months after the 
last patient was recruited, the study was to stopped. The minimum follow-up time period of 14 months 
for the prospective arm was considered appropriate because approximately 80% of patients who had an 
objective  response  in  a  pivotal  Phase  3  study  achieved  their  response  within  14  months  of  starting 
vandetanib. The study design is summarized in Figure 2. 
Figure 2. Study flow chart 
In  addition  to  patients  prospectively  and  retrospectively  enrolled  at  study  sites  in  OBS14778,  patient 
data from study D4200C00058 were included in the final analysis of OBS14778. Study D4200C00058 
was an international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, Phase 3 study designed 
to  assess  whether  vandetanib  300  mg  daily  improves  PFS  compared  to  placebo  in  patients  with 
unresectable  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  MTC.  Data  for  patients  who  were  categorized  as  RET 
mutation “unknown” and “negative” in the original analysis of D4200C00058 had their archived biopsy 
samples  reanalyzed  to  categorize  the  patients  as  RET  mutation  positive  or  negative.  Patients  who 
remained  with  an  “unknown”  mutation  status  after  reanalysis  were  not  pooled  with  patients  from 
OBS14778.

The study began with first patient in on 17 February 2014 and ended with last patient out on 18 June 
2020. Prospective recruitment lasted from Q1 2014 through Q1 2020; retrospective recruitment started 
in Q4 2019 and lasted until Q2 2020. The study was terminated on 10 July 2020. 
All  prospective  participants  were  followed  when  on  treatment  for  at  least  14  months  provided  it  was 
considered appropriate for a patient to remain on treatment in the opinion of the Investigator. In any 
case, all included patients (prospective and retrospective) were followed for data collection until death, 
loss of follow-up, or end of the study. 
Study participants 
For prospective patients, once vandetanib was launched in the country and the participant site had the 
appropriate local approvals, the Investigator systematically identified and invited to participate in the 
study every consenting patient who fulfilled inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria. The recruitment of 
patients  was  centrally  controlled  by  the  study  team  through  the  Web-based  Data  Capture  (WBDC) 
system. 
For retrospective patients, the sites searched through their own database for MTC patients, reviewed the 
records using 2010 as a recruitment cutoff without any limitation for the date of diagnosis, identified all 
RET  mutation  negative  patients  and  included  them  into  the  study  (unless  there  was  a  contract  with 
another company for a clinical trial that precludes this). 
Inclusion criteria were: 
1.  Signed informed consent for prospective patients (a waiver was requested for retrospective patients). 
2.  Male or female aged 18 years or above for prospective patients. No age restriction for retrospective 
patients. 
3.  Histological diagnosis of MTC (for retrospective patients [prevalent MTC patients] diagnosis could be 
as early as possible, without any limitation for the date of diagnosis). 
4.  Patients  with  symptomatic  and  aggressive  sporadic  MTC,  who  had  unresectable,  locally 
advanced/metastatic disease 
5.  Measurable disease: 
•  Assessment confirmed within the 12 weeks before start of treatment, and 
•  Defined according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1: at least 1 lesion, 
not irradiated, that could be accurately measured as ≥10 mm in the longest diameter (except 
lymph nodes which had short axis ≥15 mm) with computed tomography or magnetic resonance 
imaging and which was suitable for accurate repeated measurements. Measurable lesions with 
calcifications were not assessed as target lesions unless no other measurable lesion was available. 
• 
For prospective patients prescribed vandetanib: positive or negative; 
In patients with known definite RET mutation status (positive or negative). 
− 
− 
− 
− 
For prospective patients not prescribed vandetanib: negative; 
For retrospective patients prescribed or not prescribed vandetanib: negative; 
For prospective patients: RET mutation status was determined from a tumor sample obtained 
within  18  months  prior  to  enrollment.  It  was  strongly  recommended that  a  tissue  sample 
obtained  within  6  months  prior  to  enrollment  was  used.  For  retrospective  patients:  RET 
mutation negative mutation status could have been determined within 18 months before or 
after start of treatment (with vandetanib or another drug). In case of retrospective patient 
treated with another drug, the patient was supposed to be treated with vandetanib at any 
time 
6.  For prospective patients newly prescribed vandetanib 300 mg, the prescription was issued according 
to marketing authorization and following the vandetanib SmPC. The starting dose could have been

reduced  to  200  mg  in  patients  with  moderate  renal  impairment.  For  retrospective  patients,  the 
prescription may or may not have been issued according to the SmPC. 
7.  The  prescription  of  the  medicinal  product  was  clearly  separated  from  the  decision  to  include  the 
patient in the non-interventional study. 
Exclusion criteria were: 
1.  Current or planned inclusion/participation in a clinical trial, not applicable for retrospective patients. 
2.  Patients already receiving vandetanib or who had received vandetanib for their MTC before the study 
first visit; not applicable for retrospective patients. 
3.  Contraindications according to the vandetanib SmPC (not applicable for retrospective patients and 
for patients who did not receive vandetanib): 
•  Patients with a QTc interval over 480 msec; 
−  Congenital long QT syndrome 
−  Concomitant use of vandetanib with the following medicinal products known to also prolong 
the  QT  interval  and/or  induce  Torsades  de  pointes:  arsenic,  cisapride,  erythromycin 
intravenous, toremifene, mizolastine, moxifloxacine, Class IA and III antiarrhythmics 
•  Pregnant or breastfeeding; 
•  Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients; 
•  Severe renal impairment; 
•  Serum bilirubin greater than 1.5 × the upper limit of reference range; 
•  Potassium, magnesium, or calcium outside the normal laboratory range. 
RET mutation status 
For  patients  prospectively  or  retrospectively  enrolled  in  OBS14778,  the  assay  to  determine  mutation 
status will be done or may have been done (in case of retrospective patients) in certified laboratories 
and must be based on one of these 3 tests: 
•  Sequencing 
• 
•  Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) 
PCR including ARMS methodology 
For this study, the criteria for definition of the RET status is as follows: 
• 
• 
If mutation is present in M918T (exon 16) or any other additional exon tested where RET mutations 
have been described (10, 11, 13 to16), then the patient is RET mutation positive. 
If  mutation  is  absent  in  M918T  (exon  16),  and  in  any  of  the  other  additional  exons  where  RET 
mutations have been described (10, 11, 13 to 16), then the patient is RET mutation negative. 
For  patients  in  study  D4200C00058  in  the  original  analysis,  RET  mutation  status  was  determined  by 
AstraZeneca’s  Tissue  Bank  Reception  (Alderly  Park,  Macclesfield,  Cheshire  United  Kingdom)  by 
sequencing  the  6  most  commonly  mutated  exons  in  MTC  (exons  10,  11,  13,  14,  15,  and  16)  and  by 
evaluating for the M918T mutation using an amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) analysis. 
Based on the assay technology available at the time the study was run, 56.5% of patients were found 
to be RET positive, 2.4% were RET negative, and 41.1% had an unknown RET mutation status due to 
the limitations of the assay. 
To more reliably determine the true mutation status for the patients recruited in the original study, an 
extensive molecular analysis of the MTC tumor samples was performed for patients with adequate sample 
material available who had a RET mutation unknown or negative status in the original analysis. For this 
reassessment of study D4200C00058 samples, histology slides of residual tumor tissue from the clinical

study were reviewed and tumor-containing regions were identified and marked by a pathologist. In a 
subset of samples, normal areas were identified for comparison with the tumor material. The DNA was 
extracted using standard methods. The RET genotyping of the extracted DNA was carried out with 1 of 
the following platforms: 
• 
Initially, some samples were genotyped for the RET M918T mutation using a custom Taqman assay. 
Samples  with  scant  material  were  not  analyzed  further;  samples  with  adequate  material  were 
sequenced using Illumina technology to reveal any other RET mutations. 
•  Barcoded sequencing libraries were made from the tissue DNA. 
•  The RET sequences were enriched using a custom Agilent SureSelect reagent and sequenced on an 
Illumina sequencer. 
•  Data processing and automated calling of RET variants were carried out using the Broad Genome 
Analysis ToolKit (GATK) pipeline with manual curation of any difficult cases using Broad Integrative 
Genomics Viewer (IGV). 
The results of this reanalysis were correlated with clinical data to determine whether there are significant 
relationships between molecular data and clinical outcomes.

The study was originally designed to have a sample size of 80 patients (40 RET negative and 40 RET 
positive). However, due to recruitment challenges related to the rarity of RET mutation negative patients 
with locally advanced and metastatic MTC (approximately 10%) and due to medical practice standards 
(in  current  practice,  RET  mutation  status  is  not  evaluated  prior  to  treatment),  the  sample  size  and 
sources of patients were revised in accordance with EMA agreement on 28 February 2019. In Amended 
Protocol 02 dated 21 June 2019, the sample size was reduced to 40 to 50 patients with symptomatic, 
aggressive,  sporadic,  unresectable,  locally  advanced/metastatic  MTC  to  yield  20  to  25  RET  mutation 
negative and 20 to 25 RET mutation positive patients. 
The Sponsor stopped the recruitment and terminated the study on 10 July 2020. The termination decision 
was  supported  by  EMA  per  its  conclusions  and  recommendations  embedded  in  the  Request  of

Statistical methods 
The enrolled population consisted of all patients enrolled in OBS14778 in the prospective cohort (after 
having signed an informed consent) and in the retrospective cohort (waiver); and patients from study 
D4200C00058  who  were  randomized  to  vandetanib  and  had  a  RET  status  evaluation  based  on  a  re-
analysis of their archived tissue. The evaluable population consisted of all enrolled and eligible patients 
with a known RET mutation test status (positive or negative) treated with at least 1 dose of vandetanib 
and who had a RECIST assessment evaluable at baseline. The non-evaluable population consisted of all 
enrolled  patients  who  did  not  meet  the  criteria  to  be  in  the  evaluable  population  (eg,  did  not  meet 
inclusion/exclusion  criteria,  did  not  take  at  least  1  dose  of  vandetanib,  or  did  not  have  an  evaluable 
baseline  RECIST  assessment).  These  patients  were  not  included  in  any  of  the  efficacy  analyses.  The 
safety population consisted of enrolled population who had received at least 1 dose of vandetanib. 
Qualitative variables were described by number of observed values, percentage, and number of missing 
values,  if  pertinent  2-sided  95%  confidence  intervals  (CIs)  of  proportion  (patients  with  missing  data 
were  not  to  be  included  in  the  percentage  calculation).  Quantitative  variables  were  described  by  the 
number of observed values, mean, standard deviation, median, first quartile, third quartile, minimum, 
and maximum. For time-to-event, the median time to event and number and percentage of each group

remaining at risk at the last point of observation were provided. The analyses were performed by RET 
mutation status, study, and overall unless otherwise specified for some variables. 
Efficacy results 
Participants 
Three categories of patients were recruited in the study: 
1.  40  patients  prospectively  (30  patients  with  RET  positive  mutation,  7  patients  with  RET  negative 
mutation, 3 patients with unknown RET status) 
2.  10 RET negative patients retrospectively recruited at study sites 
3.  47  patients  from  the  randomized  study  D4200C00058  who  had  their  RET  status  reanalysed  (36 
patients with RET positive mutation, 11 patients with RET negative mutation). 
As of 17 December 2020 (the database lock date), a total of 30 sites in 8 countries were participating 
(Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom), including 
4 sites specifically involved in the retrospective data collection effort on RET negative patients. Among 
the 30 sites, 18 sites responded that they did not have any RET negative patient to contribute to the 
retrospective data collection effort. 
Overall, a total of 97 patients underwent formal screening for inclusion in this study. As summarized in 
Table 13, a total of 97 patients were screened and enrolled in this study, of whom 91 (93.8%) patients 
were exposed to at least 1 dose of vandetanib and included in the safety population; the other 6 patients 
were excluded from the safety population because they did not receive vandetanib. 
Of the 97 patients screened, a total of 75 (77.3%) patients were evaluable for efficacy and 22 (22.7%) 
patients  were  non-evaluable  (15  [15.5%]  patients  had  no  evaluable  baseline  RECIST  assessment,  6 
[6.2%]  patients  did  not  meet  eligibility  criteria,  and 1  [1.0%]  patient  did  not  take  at  least  1  dose  of 
vandetanib).  Of  the  75  evaluable  patients,  there  were  55  RET  positive  patients  and  20  RET  negative 
patients  included  in  this  analysis.  As  summarized  in  Table  13,  a  higher  proportion  of  RET  negative 
patients were non-evaluable compared to RET positive patients (28.6% [RET negative] versus 16.7% 
[RET positive]). 
Of the 75 patients evaluable for efficacy, 41 (54.7%) patients withdrew prematurely (see Table 14): 14 
(18.7%) patients due to disease progression, 5 (6.7%) patients due to AEs (cutaneous rash, n=2; acute 
kidney injury, n=1; empyema, n=1; ALT increased, n=1), 1 (1.3%) patient due to disease progression 
(recorded also as safety reason), 1 (1.3%) due to severe non-compliance to protocol, 3 (4.0%) patients 
due to patient decision, and 8 (10.7%) patients due to other reasons. Nine (12.0%) patients died which 
led to premature withdrawal from the study. 
There were 7 patients with major protocol deviations reported during the study, 5 patients in the RET 
positive group and 2 patients in the RET negative group. Of these 7 major protocol deviations, 4 were 
due to non-respect of inclusion/exclusion criteria.

Baseline characteristics 
Demographic and patient characteristics 
The  median  age  of  patients  was  50  years  (range:  20  to  77  years),  higher  for  RET  negative  patients 
compared to RET positive (56.5 years versus 45.0 years). A total of 47 (62.7%) patients were males 
and  28  (37.3%)  were  females.  Most  patients  (68  patients  [91.9%])  were  white.  Median  weight  and 
height of patients was 74.0 kg and 172.0 cm, respectively (see Table 15).

Disease characteristics at baseline 
Disease  characteristics  at  baseline  were  somewhat  variable  between  patients.  The  median  time  from 
MTC diagnosis to first dose of vandetanib was 71.4 months overall (65.9 months and 89.6 months for 
RET  positive  and  RET  negative  patients,  respectively).  Median  time  from  diagnosis  of  sporadic, 
unresectable, locally advanced/metastatic MTC to first dose of vandetanib was 10.3 months overall (5.5 
months and 17.0 months for RET positive and RET negative patients, respectively). Most patients had

disease  stage IVc  at  baseline  (62  [83.8%]  patients overall,  46  [83.6%]  RET  positive  patients  and  16 
[84.2%]  RET  negative  patients).  The  median  time  from  last  disease  progression  to  first  dose  of 
vandetanib  was  2.4  months  overall  (1.97  months  and  5.6  months  for  RET  positive  and  RET  negative 
patients, respectively). 
Prior medical and surgical history 
Among  32  evaluable  patients  enrolled  at  study  sites  (prospectively  or  retrospectively),  13  (40.6%) 
patients reported a previous medical history and 25 (78.1%) patients reported current medical history 
(mainly hypothyroidism 68.8%, other relevant disease 34.4%, hypocalcemia 18.8%, and hypertension 
18.8%).  Among  43  evaluable  patients  from  the  Phase  3  study  D4200C00058,  19  (44.2%)  patients 
reported a previous medical history and 36 (83.7%) patients reported current medical history (mainly 
diarrhea 34.9%, hypothyroidism 18.6%, hypertension 18.6%, fatigue 14.0%, back pain 14.0%). A total 
of 66 (88.0%) patients had a prior surgical history among evaluable patients. 
Prior anti-cancer therapy 
Previous cancer therapies were as follows: 63 (84.0%) had prior thyroidectomy, 28 (37.3%) patients 
received prior radiotherapy, 8 (10.7%) patients received prior chemotherapy. 
Prior and concomitant medications 
In the evaluable population, a total of 74 (98.7%) patients had prior medications. The most frequent 
(>30%) anatomical classes (from ATC) were systemic hormonal preparations, excl. sex hormones and 
insulins (89.3% of patients), alimentary tract and metabolism (60.0%), and nervous system (30.7%). 
All  evaluable  patients  (n=75,  100.0%)  had  concomitant  medications.  The  most  frequent  (>50%) 
anatomical classes (from ATC) were systemic hormonal preparations, excl. sex hormones and insulins 
(90.7% of patients), alimentary tract and metabolism (89.3%), nervous system (64.0%), cardiovascular 
system (54.7%), and anti-infectives for systemic use (50.7%). 
A  total  of  24  (32.0%)  patients  used  at  least  1  opioid  analgesic  before  enrollment,  mainly  for  mild  to 
moderate pain (17 patients) and severe pain (9 patients). The median number of opioids used per patient 
was 1.5 with a median cumulative duration of 5.0 months of use per patient. The most common opioids 
used  were  codeine  with  acetaminophen  (9  patients),  morphine  sulphate  (7  patients),  oxycodone  (4 
patients), tramadol (4 patients), and other (5 patients). 
Efficacy results 
The median duration of follow-up was 27.6 months (range: 2.8 to 63.7 months) for RET positive patients 
(n=55) and 30.8 months (range: 2.8 to 82.5 months) for RET negative patients (n=20). Results for ORR, 
DCR, time to response, and DOR are presented in Table 16. 
Tumor response was evaluated in 55 RET positive patients and 20 RET negative patients. Overall, 24 
patients (32.0%) had an objective response which included 2 CR and 22 PR. The ORR for RET positive 
patients was 41.8% (95% CI: 28.7-55.9), and 5.0% (95% CI: 0.1-24.9) for RET negative patients. More 
RET positive patients experienced CR and PR compared to RET negative patients (CR: 3.6% versus 0%; 
PR:  38.2%  versus  5.0%  in  RET  positive  and  RET  negative  patients,  respectively).  More  RET  negative 
patients had SD compared to RET positive patients (85.0% versus 43.6%). Few patients experienced PD 
(5 [6.7%] patients overall, 4 [7.3%] in RET positive patients versus 1 [5.0%] in RET negative patients). 
The DCR (CR, PR, or SD) was apparently not significantly different for RET positive and RET negative 
patients (85.5% [95% CI: 73.3-93.5] versus 90.0% [95% CI: 68.3-98.8], respectively). 
The median time to response was 5.5 months (range: 2.7 to 30.7 months) in RET positive patients and 
8.3 months for the RET negative patient (Table 17).

Overall, 50 progression events (disease progression or death from any cause) were noted at the time of 
the analysis, 36 (65.5%) in RET positive patients and 14 (70.0%) in RET negative patients. Of these 
progression events, there were 6 deaths (4 [11.1%] patients in RET positive patients and 2 [14.3%] in 
RET negative patients). 
In the overall evaluable population, the median PFS (95% CI) was 24.6 months (95% CI: 15.6-31.8) in 
RET positive patients and 24.6 months (95% CI: 9.9-59.5) in RET negative patients. Details are provided 
in Table 18. 
The Kaplan Meier estimate of PFS (95% CI) at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months for RET positive and RET 
negative patients is provided in Table 18. At 12 months, 27% of RET positive patients and 23% of RET 
negative patients were estimated to have progressed; at 24 months, 50% of RET positive patients and 
41% of RET negative patients were estimated to have progressed. The Kaplan-Meier curves for PFS are 
provided in Figure 5. 
At the end of the study, no progression was observed in 25 (33.3%) patients overall (19 [34.5%] RET 
positive patients and 6 [30.0%] RET negative patients), 50 (66.7%) patients had progressed (36 [65.5%] 
RET positive patients and 14 [70.0%] RET negative patients), and 6 (8.0%) patients had died (4 [7.3%] 
patients were RET positive and 2 [10.0%] patients were RET negative).

The calcitonin (CTN) values progressively decreased over time in the overall evaluable population and in 
both RET positive and RET negative patients, but the decrease appeared much more rapid in RET positive 
patients (see Figure 6). 
In the overall evaluable population, the mean (SD) CTN value at baseline was 17457.5 (48035.8) ng/L, 
11075.5 (31238.9) ng/L at Month 3, 7114.1 (13770.8) ng/L at Month 6, 7104.0 (13209.6) ng/L at Month 
12, 5307.1 (6629.0) ng/L at Month 18, and 5113.5 (8279.8) ng/L at Month 30. 
In  RET  positive  patients,  the  mean  (SD)  CTN  value  at  baseline  was  16500.3  (51386.7)  ng/L.  The 
decrease in CTN value was quite rapid with mean (SD) values of 9415.9 (33081.5) ng/L at Month 3, 
3764.8 (7237.4) ng/L at Month 6, 3275.3 (5187.2) ng/L at Month 12, 2140.8 (2620.1) ng/L at Month 
18, and 2054.5 (3265.8) ng/L at Month 30. 
In  RET  negative  patients,  the  mean  (SD)  CTN  value  at  baseline  was  20041.8  (38599.5)  ng/L.  The 
decrease in CTN values was slower over time with mean (SD) values of 15543.5 (26300.5) ng/L at Month 
3, 16324.4 (21908.3) ng/L at Month 6, 17197.8 (21227.4) ng/L at Month 12, 11956.5 (7661.9) ng/L at

Serious adverse events 
Overall, 26 patients (28.6%) exposed to vandetanib reported 44 serious TEAEs, regardless of relationship 
with study treatment, 20 (31.3%) RET positive patients (31 serious TEAEs) and 6 (22.2%) RET negative 
patients (13 serious TEAEs). These serious TEAEs are summarized by SOC and PT, overall and by RET 
mutation status in Table 21.

Adverse events leading to discontinuations 
A total of 14 (15.4%) patients had 15 TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation, 9 (14.1%) RET positive 
patients  (9  TEAEs)  and  5  (18.5%)  RET  negative  patients  (6  TEAEs).  The  TEAEs  leading  to  treatment 
discontinuation are summarized in Table 23.

A total of 16 (17.6%) patients had 22 TEAEs leading to discontinuation from the study, as summarized 
in Table 24. A higher proportion of patients with RET negative mutation (6 [22.2%] patients, 8 TEAEs) 
experienced TEAEs that led to discontinuation from study in comparison to patients with RET positive 
mutation (10 [15.6%] patients, 14 TEAEs).

Deaths 
In  all,  27  (29.1%)  patients  died  during  the  study;  of  these,  23 deaths  were  not  due  to  an  AE  and  4 
deaths were due to an AE. The 27 patients consisted of 20 RET positive patients and 7 RET negative 
patients. A summary of all 27 patients who died during the study is provided in Table 25. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/30610/2023

Of the 4 patients who died due to an AE: 
•  Two RET mutation positive patients had an AE with fatal outcome per the initial CTCAE grade. 
−  One patient experienced an AE of disease progression, unrelated to vandetanib 
−  The other patient, previously reported in Study D4200C00058, experienced AEs of cardiac failure 
acute and arrhythmia, both of which were considered related to vandetanib. 
•  One RET mutation negative patient, previously reported in Study D4200C00058, had an AE with fatal 
outcome following a CTCAE grade change; this patient experienced an AE of pneumonia aspiration, 
unrelated to vandetanib. 
•  One RET mutation positive patient) had an AE of disease progression with a maximum CTCAE grade 
of “severe”; this AE was unrelated to vandetanib. 
Of the 23 patients for which the cause of death was not reported as an AE, 17 were RET positive and 6 
were RET negative. For these 23 patients, the reported primary causes of death were MTC (5 patients), 
underlying  disease  (1  patient),  and  respiratory  insufficiency  (secondary  cause  of  death:  disease 
progression) (1 patient); for the other 16 patients, the primary cause of death was unknown. 
Table 24. Summary of primary cause of death - Safety Population 
Investigations 
A total of 13 patients (14.3%) experienced TEAEs of electrocardiogram QT prolonged (11 RET positive 
[17.2%]  and  2  RET  negative  [7.4%]  patients);  in  12  (13.2%)  the  TEAE  was  assessed  as  related  to 
vandetanib.  In  6  of  the  13  cases,  the  event  was  mild,  in  5  moderate,  and in  2  severe.  These  events 
resolved  for  all  but  3  patients,  who  had  mild/moderate  cases  and  were  lost  to  follow-up  (one  due  to 
disease progression, one due to withdrawal from study related to a different AE, and one due to study 
closure in July 2020). One patient (RET positive) experienced a serious TEAE of electrocardiogram QT 
prolonged, which resolved. 
The mean QTc (Bazett) showed similar mean QTc intervals for RET positive and RET negative patients 
through Week 144 (generally ranging from 436 – 456 ms). 
A total of 8 patients experienced a QTc interval >500 ms (associated with increased risk of ventricular 
arrhythmia),  7  of  whom  were  RET  positive  and  1  of  whom  was  RET  negative,  and  6  of  whom  were 
originally  enrolled  in  Study  D4200C00058.  Of  these  8  patients,  2  experienced  other  cardiac-related 
TEAEs (E2301002 and E2301006); all of these TEAEs resolved except for an ongoing mild left bundle 
branch  block  (E2301002)  and  the  fatal  TEAEs  of  arrythmia  and  cardiac  failure,  considered  related  to 
vandetanib (as noted above, this patient case has already been reported in the D4200C00058 CSR and

labeled). The QT prolongation is an expected adverse drug reaction of vandetanib along with ventricular 
arrhythmia labeled in the vandetanib SmPC. 
There was no significant difference between the RET positive and negative patients in reference to the 
laboratory parameters and vital signs. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
In the response, the MAH provided the final CSR for study D4200C00104 (OBS14778) as requested. In 
this CSR data were pooled from the observational D4200C00104 study (prospectively and retrospectively 
enrolled  patients)  and  the  phase  3  D4200C00058  study  (reanalyzed  samples  that  were  previously 
categorized as RET mutation “unknown”). This is in line with the SOB formulated after variation II/0028 
to enroll 20-25 RET mutation positive and 20-25 RET mutation negative patients including retrospective 
enrollment in study D4200C00104 and re-analysis of samples in the pivotal study D4200C00058. The 
study population analyzed in the CSR consisted of the following three groups: 
1.  40  patients  prospectively  recruited  (30  patients  with  RET  positive  mutation,  7  patients  with  RET 
negative mutation, 3 patients with unknown RET status) 
2.  10 RET negative patients retrospectively recruited 
3.  47  patients  from  the  randomized  study  D4200C00058  who  had  their  RET  status  reanalyzed  (36 
patients with RET positive mutation, 11 patients with RET negative mutation). 
As part of the study was specifically recruiting RET negative patients, a higher than expected percentage 
of all patients had a RET negative status. 
Regarding  efficacy,  tumor  response  was  evaluated  in  55  RET  positive  patients  and  20  RET  negative 
patients. In the RET negative population, 1 patient from study D4200C00058 had no evaluable baseline 
RECIST assessment. In addition, 7 patients were not evaluable in the retrospective RET negative cohort 
in study D4200C00104: 1 did not meet eligibility criteria, 1 did not take at least 1 dose of vandetanib, 
and 5 had no evaluable baseline RECIST assessment. For response analysis, there was no central review 
of imaging in the prospective and retrospective cohorts. The ORR was 41.8% (95% CI: 28.7-55.9) for 
RET  positive  patients  and  5.0%  (n=1  [PR];  95%  CI:  0.1-24.9)  for  RET  negative  patients.  More  RET 
positive patients experienced CR and PR compared to RET negative patients (CR: 3.6% versus 0%; PR: 
38.2% versus 5.0%, respectively). The one patient achieving a PR in the RET negative cohort was from 
study D4200C00058. Compared to the preliminary analysis provided before, there is one patient less 
achieving a response in the RET negative population. Based on the information provided previously the 
patients with a response in the RET negative population had a RAS mutation and the MAH is requested 
to confirm that the one patient in the final CSR with a response in the RET negative population had a 
RAS mutation and to describe this in the SmPC (OC), as this might mechanistically explain activity in a 
RET  negative  tumor.  SD  was  reported  in  43.6%  of  the  RET  positive  patients  and  85.0%  of  the  RET 
negative patients. For PD these numbers were 7.3% in RET positive patients and 5.0% in RET negative 
patients, respectively. DCR (CR, PR, or SD) was 85.5% in the cohort with RET positive patients and 90% 
in the cohort with RET negative patients. Median DOR was 24.9 months in the RET positive patients and 
for the 1 RET negative patient this was 5.3 months. Median PFS (95% CI) was 24.6 months (95% CI: 
15.6-31.8) in RET positive patients and 24.6 months (95% CI: 9.9-59.5) in RET negative patients. There 
were 4 deaths (11.1%) in RET positive patients and 2 (14.3%) in RET negative patients. Time dependent 
outcomes are difficult to interpret in this non-randomized, observational study. ORR in the RET positive 
patients was comparable to that shown in study D4200C0058 (i.e. 45%). However, the response rate of 
5% in RET negative patients was substantially lower than the response rate of 35% in the cohort of 46 
patients  who  were  classified  as  RET  negative  (i.e.  “with  no  M918T  mutation  and  no  other  identified 
mutation”) and treated with vandetanib in the registration study. This discrepancy is as yet unexplained. 
Also, which RET mutations were investigated at the time of approval besides the M918T in that population 
Assessment report

is  not  clear.  As  a  consequence,  the  B/R  in  the  RET  negative  patients  may  be  impacted.  The  MAH  is, 
therefore, requested to elaborate on the differences in response rate reported at the time of the CMA 
and the currently provided data, including a clarification on the performed RET mutation analysis at the 
time of approval in comparison to the currently provided re-analysis. Next, the MAH should confirm that 
all  of  the  46  patients  classified  at  the  time  of  approval  as  RET-negative  would  still  be  RET-negative 
following re-analysis. Finally, the MAH should discuss the impact of this additional information on the 
B/R in the RET-negative patients (MO). 
Regarding  safety,  91  patients  received  at  least  1  dose  of  vandetanib  (64  RET  positive  and  27  RET 
negative) with a median exposure of around 2 years. Based on the provided results, a higher rate of AEs 
(98  vs  89%)  and  serious  AEs  (31  vs  22%)  were  reported  in  the  RET  positive  compared  to  the  RET 
negative patients. Most common AEs observed were diarrhea, rash, and hypertension. It is agreed with 
the MAH that the reported AEs are consistent with the known safety profile of vandetanib. It is noted 
that the toxicity profile is substantial and should be weighed against the benefit in RET negative patients. 
In conclusion, data from a total of 20 RET negative patients treated with vandetanib were available. This 
is in line with the SOB formulated after variation II/0028 to enroll 20-25 RET mutation positive and 20-
25  RET  mutation  negative  patients  including  retrospective  enrollment  in  study  D4200C00104  and  re-
analysis of samples in the pivotal study D4200C00058. The activity in the RET negative patients is low 
with  only  1  responder  in  20  efficacy  evaluable  patients.  Combined  with  the  currently  identified 
uncertainties  on  the  efficacy  in  the  patients  previously  classified  as  RET-negative  and  the  known 
substantial toxicity, the B/R in RET negative patients is uncertain (MO). The B/R balance for the RET 
positive population remains positive. 
Based on the provided response to the MO, the indication might have to be restricted to RET positive 
patients.  Therefore,  possible  consequences  to  section  4.1  and  4.4  of  the  SmPC  can  currently  not  be 
assessed. It is, in principle, agreed to update section 5.1 with the data provided. Regarding the text in 
section 5.1 textual changes are proposed (please refer to the SmPC assessment; OC). A final conclusion 
can be made pending the B/R in the RET negative patients. 
Based on the provided CSR the MAH considers that the SOB001 is fulfilled and can be lifted from the 
Marketing Authorisation in order to convert it from a conditional to a standard MA. As the final CSR is 
currently  submitted  confirming  the  efficacy  and  safety  in  Caprelsa  in  20  RET  negative  patients,  it  is 
agreed that the SOB is, in principle, fulfilled pending the response to the LoQ. However, based on the 
provided data the B/R in RET negative patients is uncertain (MO). 
Of note, as written in a previous communication with and agreed by the EMA in 2020, the MAH is not 
providing an updated RMP, it will be provided in another variation upon approval of the current type II 
labelling variation at a later stage.

35% in the cohort of 46 patients classified as RET negative (i.e. “with no M918T mutation and 
no other identified mutation”) in the registration study. This discrepancy is unexplained and B/R 
in the RET negative patients may be impacted. Also, which RET mutations were investigated at

Clinical aspects 
Question 1 
The response rate of 5% in RET negative patients was lower than the reported response rate of 35% in 
the cohort of 46 patients classified as RET negative (i.e. “with no M918T mutation and no other 
identified mutation”) in the registration study. This discrepancy is unexplained and B/R in the RET 
negative patients may be impacted. Also, which RET mutations were investigated at the time of 
approval besides the M918T in that population is not clear. Therefore, the MAH is requested to: 
a.  elaborate on the differences in response rate reported at the time of the CMA and the 
currently provided data, including a clarification on the performed RET mutation analysis 
at the time of approval in comparison to the currently provided re-analysis and details 
on subjects disposition and patient flow specific to RET mutation status (re-)classification 
over time; 
b.  the MAH should confirm that all of the 46 patients classified and treated with vandetanib 
at the time of approval as RET-negative would still be RET-negative following re-analysis; 
c.  subsequently,  discuss  the  B/R  in  the  RET  negative  population  given  the  known 
substantial toxicity profile. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Question 1a 
The differences in objective tumor response rates are explained by progresses made by the science in 
determining RET status in patients with medullary thyroid cancer (MDT): 
•  At the time of the CMA (February 2012), the response rate in 46 patients treated with vandetanib 
and having no M918T mutation in study D4200C00058 was 35%, based on a blinded central review 
of imaging. 
•  At that time, it was hypothesized that patients having no M918T mutation by amplification refractory 
mutation system (ARMS) analysis had a high probability (86%) to have no additional RET mutation 
detected  (Elisei  et  al.,  J  Clin  Endocrinol  Metab,  2008)  (see  also  Appendix  1  below  for  detailed 
description of the methodology and results obtained). 
• 
In  December  2018,  as  part  of  the  variation  procedure  no.  EMEA/H/C/002315/II/0028,  the  MAH 
proposed to re-analyze the mutation status of patients enrolled in study D4200C00058 using new 
technologies.  Using  these  new  technologies  only  11  out  of  46  patients  (23.9%)  treated  with 
vandetanib were confirmed to be RET-negative. All other patients were reclassified as being RET-
positive (see Appendix 1 below for detailed description of the methodology and results obtained). 
•  Recruitment  of  RET-negative  patients  in  the  observational  study  OBS14778/D4200C00104  was 
difficult. It was thus agreed to pool RET-negative patients newly identified from re-analysis of study 
D4200C00058 (with patients enrolled in study OBS14778). 
Study OBS14778 thus analyzed 10 RET-negative patients from study D4200C00058 (1 patient was 
excluded  because  RECIST  evaluation  at  baseline  was  lacking),  7  RET-negative  patients  recruited 
prospectively and 3 RET-negative patients recruited retrospectively. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/30610/2023  
Page 68/94 
 
 
 
Objective  responses  were  exclusively  found  in  patients  from  study  D4200C00058.  Therefore,  the 
objective response (ORR) in RET-negative patients of Study OBS14778 was as follows: 
−  5% (1/20) as per investigator evaluation of tumor response in study D4200C00058 (listing 
used for the analysis of Study OBS14778) 
−  10%  (2/20)  as  per  blinded  centralized  review  of  tumor  response  in  study  D4200C00058 
(listing not used for the analysis of Study OBS14778) 
The fact that no objective tumor response was observed in patients recruited either prospectively or 
retrospectively in study OBS14778 may be partly explained by the observational design of the study 
(lack of central review of tumor response, frequency of monitoring visits left at the discretion of the 
treating physician, no centralized determination of RET status). 
Based on the above information, the MAH believes that the ORR rate observed following the reanalysis 
of  RET  status  in  Study  D4200C00058  (18.2%)  is  more  reliable,  since  it  was  a  randomized  placebo-
controlled trial with a blinded central review of imaging. Results of this reanalysis of are provided below 
(see Appendix 2 below): 
•  Of  the  69  patients  lacking  mutation  M918T  and  who  had  their  RET  status  re-analyzed,  17  were 
confirmed to be RET-negative (11 in the vandetanib arm and 6 in the placebo arm) and 52 were 
reclassified at RET-positive, leading to a total of 239 RET-positive patients (172 in the vandetanib 
arm and 67 in the placebo arm). 
• 
Two (2) out of 11 RET-negative patients (18.2%) treated with vandetanib had an objective tumor 
response versus 0 out of 6 patients treated with placebo (Table 26). 
•  At 2 years, 90% of RET-negative patients treated with vandetanib had no disease progression versus 
50% of RET-negative patients treated with placebo (Table 27).

Interestingly,  a  vast  majority  of  RET-negative  patients  in  study  D4200C00058  were  found  to  have  a 
concomitant  RAS  mutation  (14/17,  82.4%).  In  a  recent  series  of  209  patients  with  MTC  analyzed  by 
next-generation  sequencing  (Ciampi  et  al.,  iScience,  2019),  RAS  mutations  were  observed  in 
approximately  30%  of  cases  and  were  mutually  exclusive  with  RET  mutations.  Both  RET-negative 
patients having an objective tumor response with vandetanib had a concomitant RAS mutation. 
Appendix 1: History of RET mutation analysis 
Initial RET mutation statis determination in study D4200C00058 (phase III study) 
Initial  RET  mutation  status  was  determined  by  AstraZeneca’s  Tissue  Bank  Reception  (Alderley  Park, 
Macclesfield, Cheshire UK) by sequencing the 6 most commonly mutated exons in MTC (10, 11, 13, 14, 
15 and 16) and by looking for the M918T mutation using an ARMS analysis. 
•  A  RET-positive  mutation  status  was  defined  as  having  a  mutation  either  observed  from  the 
sequencing or ARMS assay. 
•  A RET-negative mutation status was defined as having the sequencing assay successfully showing 
wild type sequence at all 6 exons plus the ARMS assay negative for a M918T mutation. 
•  A  RET  “Unknown”  mutation  status  was  documented  when  1  or  more  sequencing  assay  was 
unsuccessful (non-informative) and none of the successful assays demonstrated a mutation. 
Based on this methodology, 331 patients enrolled in the Study D4200C00058 were classified as follows: 
•  187 patients (56.5%) were found to be RET-positive 
•  8 patients (2.4%) were found to be RET-negative 
•  136 patients (41.1%) had an “unknown” RET-status 
Proposed new classification of patients (based on absence of M918T mutation) in November 2011 
In November 2011, in the frame of response to second outstanding issues - clinical (sequence 0010), 
the applicant suggested a less stringent classification of patients with MTC, based on presence or absence 
of M918T mutation. This was based on a publication by Elisei (Elisei et al., J Clin Endocrinol Metab, 2008) 
suggesting that 86% of patients having no M918T mutation had no additional RET mutation identified. 
In study D4200C00058, 79 patients (8 patients initially classified as RET-negative and 71 patients initially 
classified as RET “unknown”) had no mutation M918T. It was extrapolated that these patients would be 
RET-negative. Of them, 46 received vandetanib with a response rate of 35% (Table 28).

Appendix 2: 
In December 2018, as part of the variation procedure no. EMEA/H/C/002315/II/0028 (sequence 0114), 
the MAH proposed to re-analyze the mutation status of patients enrolled in study D4200C00058 using 
new technologies. 
Of  79  patients  with  no  mutation  M918T  mutation  and  thus  considered  RET-negative  at  the  time  of 
approval, 69 had enough tissue for RET status re-analysis. 
Of these 69 patients re-analyzed, only 17 were found to be RET-negative and 52 were reclassified at 
RET-positive. A vast majority of RET-negative patients had a concomitant RAS mutation (14/17, 82.4%) 
(Table 29). 
Table 28. Overall disposition of patients enrolled in study D4200C00058 following re-analysis 
of RET status 
Among these 17 RET-negative patients, 11 received vandetanib with an ORR rate 18.2% (2/11) (Table 
30). These 2 patients were RET-negative/ RAS-positive and had a duration of  response of 38 and 96 
weeks, respectively.

Study OBS14778 (D4200C00104) 
In parallel, the observational study OBS14778 was conducted to fulfill the specific obligation linked to 
the CMA of vandetanib. 
Only 10 evaluable RET-negative patients could be recruited at study sites (7 enrolled prospectively and 
3 enrolled retrospectively). Because recruitment of RET-negative patients was difficult, it was agreed to 
pool  these  10  patients  with  10  RET-negative  patients  newly  identified  from  re-analysis  of  study 
D4200C00058 (1 patient was excluded because he was lacking RECIST evaluation at baseline). 
Among patients enrolled in prospective and retrospective cohorts, none had an ORR. Objective responses 
were  exclusively  found  in  patients  from  study  D4200C00058.  Therefore,  the  ORR  in  RET-negative 
patients of study OBS14778 was: 
• 5% (1/20) as per investigator evaluation of tumor response in study D4200C00058 (listing used for 
the analysis of study OBS14778) 
• 10% (2/20) as per blinded centralized review of tumor response in study D4200C00058 (listing not 
used for the analysis of Study OBS14778) 
Question 1b 
Of 46 patients considered RET-negative at the time of approval and treated with vandetanib, 11 patients 
were confirmed to be RET-negative, and 35 patients were reclassified as RET-positive. 
Of these 11 RET-negative patients: 
•  9 patients were RET-negative/RAS-positive 
•  1 patient was RET/RAS/BRAF-negative 
•  1 patient was RET-negative/BRAF-positive 
Question 1c 
No new safety signal was observed in RET-negative patients. Based on the cumulative evidence and the 
detailed  results  from  re-analysis  in  Study  D4200C00058,  the  B/R  in  RET-negative  patients  is  still 
considered positive by the MAH.

Conclusion 
Considering the post-hoc re-analysis of the pivotal study D4200C00058 the B/R profile of vandetanib is 
considered acceptable in RET-negative patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic MTC 
with an ORR of 18.2% with vandetanib versus 0% with placebo and a PFS rate at 2 years of 90% with 
vandetanib versus 50% with placebo. 
Interestingly,  RET-negative  patients  having  an  objective  tumor  response  with  vandetanib  had  a 
concomitant RAS mutation. These patients represent the majority of RET-negative patients. 
No new safety signal was observed in RET-negative patients. 
Thus, the MAH believes that the B/R balance of vandetanib remains positive in the currently approved 
indication regardless of the RET status and vandetanib should not be contraindicated in RET-negative 
patients with MTC. 
The MAH proposes to provide addendum reports to the 2 studies (OBS14778 and D4200C00058) as soon 
as possible and, based on the re-analysis of RET mutation status recently performed, to update more 
adequately  the  section  5.1  of  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  (SmPC)  regarding  the  RET-
negative patients. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The positive B/R for vandetanib including RET negative patients at time of CMA was based on a response 
rate per blinded central review of 35% in study D4200C00058 in 46 vandetanib-treated patients that 
had  no  M918T  mutation.  RET  mutation  status  was  determined  by  sequencing  the  6  most  commonly 
mutated exons in MTC (exon 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, and 16) and by amplification refractory mutation system 
(ARMS)  analysis.  A  RET  negative  mutation  status  was  defined  as  having  the  sequencing  assay 
successfully  showing  wild  type  sequence  at  all  6  exons  plus  the  ARMS  assay  negative  for  a  M918T 
mutation. According to the MAH, it was anticipated at that time that patients with no M918T mutation 
had a high probability to have no additional RET mutation. 
Using new technologies, part of the samples in study D4200C00058 were reanalysed, which confirmed 
RET negative status in only 11 of 46 patients previously classified as RET negative at time of CMA. The 
remaining  35  patients  were  reclassified  as  RET  positive.  The  new  technologies  used  were  a  custom 
Taqman  assay  to  genotype  the  RET  M918T  mutation  and,  when  adequate  material  was  available, 
sequencing using Illumina technology to reveal any other RET mutations. 
RET  negative  patients  as confirmed  by  new  mutation  analysis  technologies  from  study  D4200C00058 
were pooled with RET negative patients from the observational study OBS14778/D4200C00104 in order 
to provide a higher number of RET negative patients to confirm the positive B/R as SOB. The pooled RET 
negative  pool  consisted  of  10  patients  from  study  D4200C00058  and  10  patients  from  study 
OBS14778/D4200C00104 (7 recruited prospectively and 3 patients retrospectively). One of the patients 
from the D4200C00058 was excluded from the pooled analysis, because RECIST evaluation at baseline 
was  lacking.  The  MAH  is  requested  to  confirm  this  concerns  the  assessment  by  investigator  and  the 
reason  why  this  was  not  performed  or  resolved  during  the  study  (OC).  In  the  pooled  set  of  20  RET 
negative patients, in one patient from study D4200C00058 a PR was observed, leading to an ORR per 
investigator of 5%. 
The MAH is of the opinion that the analysis of RET negative patients in the D4200C00058 is more reliable 
than the pooled analysis as this was a randomised placebo-controlled study using blinded central review 
of tumour responses. According to the MAH, the observational design of study OBS14778/D4200C00104 
can partly explain the lack of responses in the study, as there was a lack of central review of tumour 
response, the frequency of monitoring visits was left at the discretion of the treating physician, and there

was no centralised determination of RET status. When looking specifically at the D4200C00058 data, an 
ORR per central review was observed of 18.2% (2 out of 11 patients). Of note, both patients had a RAS 
positive status. 
Based on the response rate in study D4200C00058 after post-hoc re-analysis of the samples, the B/R 
profile of vandetanib is considered acceptable in RET negative patients in view of the MAH with an ORR 
of 18.2% with vandetanib versus 0% with placebo and a PFS rate at 2 years of 90% with vandetanib 
versus 50% with placebo. Combined with the observation that no new safety signals were reported in 
RET  negative  patients,  the  MAH  believes  that  the  B/R  balance  of  vandetanib  remains  positive  in  the 
currently approved indication regardless of the RET status and vandetanib should not be contraindicated 
in RET negative patients with MTC. 
By  changing  the  primary  population  from  the  pooled  set  of  the  randomised  placebo-controlled  study 
D4200C00058 and the observational study OBS14778/D4200C00104 to only the D4200C00058 study, 
two  questions  arise.  The  first  question  is  whether  it  is  valid  to  leave  out  the  patients  from  the 
observational study and the second question is whether the SOB can be considered fulfilled based on 
only the D4200C00058 RET negative population. Regarding the first question, the MAH is not supported 
that the patients from the observational study should be disregarded. In the D4200C00058 RET negative 
population, only 1 response (or 2 pending on the used tumour assessment) was observed in 10 patients. 
It cannot be concluded that this is much higher than no responses in the 10 RET negative patients from 
OBS14778/D4200C00104 and to leave out the observational study population. In addition, by excluding 
the  patients  from  study  OBS14778/D4200C00104,  only  11  RET  negative  patients  are  included  which 
does not correspond with the 20-25 RET negative patients as defined in the SOB. 
An  even  more  important  question  is  whether  efficacy  and  safety  is  now  confirmed  in  RET  negative 
patients, which was the goal of the SOB. The activity in the RET negative patients is low with only 1 (or 
2) responder(s) in 20 efficacy evaluable patients. The response rate of 35% in the group with “no M918T 
mutation  and  no  other  RET  mutation  identified”  at  time  of  the  CMA  now  appears  to  be  based  on 
inaccurate data, as the majority of patients was actually RET positive. It is unlikely that the reported 
response rate of 5% in 20 RET negative patients will translate into a clinical benefit. Combined with the 
known substantial toxicity, the B/R in RET negative patients cannot be considered positive. Therefore, 
the indication should be restricted to RET positive patients (MO). The B/R balance for the RET positive 
population remains positive.In addition to the concerns described above, discrepancies were noted for 
the  number  reported  in  the  D4200C00058  study.  One  of  the  discrepancies  concerns  the  number  of 
patients that had “unknown” RET status at time of CMA based on initial RET analysis. According to the 
EPAR this number was 138, but Appendix 1 reports 136 patients with “unknown” RET status. Another 
discrepancy  that  is  noted,  is  the  number  of  RET  negative  patients  after  the  re-analysis.  The  MAH 
describes that re-analysis was performed for RET mutation status “unknown” samples (n=67), previously 
RET  negative  samples  (n=2),  and  previously  RET  positive  (n=4).  The  reanalysis  confirmed  the  four 
previously  RET  positive  patients  to  be  RET  positive,  and  1  of  2  previously  RET  negative  patients  was 
found to be RET positive. Out of the 67 RET unknown patients re-analyzed, 52 were reclassified as RET 
positive  and  15  were  found  to  be  RET  negative.  In  total,  17  patients  were  found  to  be  RET  negative 
according to the MAH. However, the number of 17 RET negative patients is not understood as 15 RET 
negative samples out of the previously unknown set and 1 RET negative patients out of the previously 
RET negative set adds up to 16. The MAH is requested to clarify these discrepancies, adjust the numbers 
if needed, and to discuss the consequences for the interpretation of the results (OC). 
Of  note,  it  was  agreed  with  the  EMA  that  an  updated  SmPC  will  be  submitted  at  a  later  stage  of  the 
procedure as the MAH had to generate additional statistical reports from the clinical study and these new 
tables  will  not  be  available  before  the  end  of  the  year/beginning  2022.  Therefore,  the  SmPC  will  be 
assessed in the next round (see also question 3).

Question 2 
The MAH is requested to confirm that the one patient in the final CSR with a response in the RET negative 
population had a RAS mutation and to describe this in the SmPC. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
It is confirmed that the RET-negative patient (E1201002) in the CSR of study OBS14778 with a response 
was RAS-positive. This patient was coming from study D4200C00058 and the ORR was determined using 
the investigator evaluation on site. 
According to the blinded central review of study D4200C00058, 2 RET-negative patients (E1001011 and 
E1701002) had an objective tumour response and patient E1201002 had a stable disease. These data 
were not reported in the CSR. Patients E1001011 and E1701002 had also a RAS mutation. 
The MAH agrees to describe this information in the SmPC. However, no updated product information is 
proposed yet, waiting for the addendum reports of studies OBS14778 and D4200C00058 to update more 
adequately the section 5.1 of the SmPC regarding the RET-negative patients. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH confirmed that that the RET-negative patient (E1201002) in the CSR of study OBS14778 with

15.1.  Major objections 
Clinical aspects 
1.  Efficacy of Caprelsa has not been established in patients with RET negative status. Having in mind 
the known substantial toxicity, the B/R balance is negative for these patients. The MAH is requested 
to restrict the indication to RET positive patients. 
15.2.  Other concerns 
Clinical aspects 
2.  The pooled RET negative sample consisted of 10 patients from study D4200C00058 and 10 
patients from study OBS14778/D4200C00104 (7 recruited prospectively and 3 patients 
retrospectively). One of the patients from the D4200C00058 was excluded from the pooled 
analysis, because RECIST evaluation at baseline was lacking. The MAH is requested to confirm this 
concerns the assessment by investigator and the reason why this was not performed or resolved 
during the study.  
3.  Discrepancies were noted for the number reported in the D4200C00058 study. One of the 
discrepancies concerns the number of patients that had “unknown” RET status at time of CMA 
based on initial RET analysis. According to the EPAR this number was 138, but Appendix 1 reports 
136 patients with “unknown” RET status. Another discrepancy that is noted, is the number of RET 
negative patients after the re-analysis. The MAH describes that re-analysis was performed for RET 
mutation status “unknown” samples (n=67), previously RET negative samples (n=2), and 
previously RET positive (n=4). The reanalysis confirmed the four previously RET positive patients 
to be RET positive, and 1 of 2 previously RET negative patients was found to be RET positive. Out 
of the 67 RET unknown patients re-analyzed, 52 were reclassified as RET positive and 15 were 
found to be RET negative. In total, 17 patients were found to be RET negative according to the 
MAH. However, the number of 17 RET negative patients is not understood as 15 RET negative 
samples out of the previously unknown set and 1 RET negative patients out of the previously RET 
negative set adds up to 16. The MAH is requested to clarify these discrepancies, adjust the 
numbers if needed, and to discuss the consequences for the interpretation of the results.

Question 1 
Efficacy of Caprelsa has not been established in patients with RET negative status. Having in mind the 
known substantial toxicity, the B/R is negative for these patients. The MAH is requested to restrict the 
indication to RET positive patients. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The MAH agrees that the activity of Caprelsa in patients lacking a RET mutation (M918T or other) is less 
pronounced than in RET “positive patients”. However, there is additional information in the two clinical 
study reports (CSR) joined to this response (addendum to Study D4500C00058 CSR, addendum of Study 
OBS14778 CSR) suggesting that Caprelsa remains a treatment option for RET “negative patients”. 
Reanalysis  of  RET  status  in  Study  D4500C00058  “An  International,  Phase  III,  Randomized,  Double-
Blinded,  Placebo-controlled,  Multi-center  Study  to  Assess  the  Efficacy  of  ZD6474  versus  Placebo  in 
Subjects with Unresectable Locally Advanced or Metastatic Medullary Thyroid Cancer” 
• 
In study D4500C00058, 79 patients had no M918T mutation identified. Of these 79 patients, 69 had 
enough tissue sample to allow a reanalysis of RET mutation status based on new available assays. 
Most patients were reclassified as RET positive (52/69) and a minority (17/69 patients) were found 
to have no RET mutation (M918T or other) detected. 
•  Of these 17 patients RET negative patients, 11 were treated with Caprelsa and 6 were treated with 
placebo.  The  activity  of  Caprelsa  appeared  lower  than  in  RET  positive  patients  but  remained 
numerically higher than placebo (Table 32): 
−  The progression-free survival (PFS) hazard ratio (HR) was 0.21 [95% CI 0.03-1.53] with a 2-
year  PFS  rate  of  90%  in  patients  treated  with  Caprelsa  versus  50%  in  patients  treated  with 
placebo. 
−  An objective tumor response was observed in 18.2% (2/11) treated with Caprelsa versus none 
of those treated with placebo (n=6). 
−  Both patients with an objective response carried a RAS mutation and had a concomitant decline 
of carcinoembryonic antigen (ACE) and/or calcitonin (CTN) serum levels. 
−  The only RET negative patient who died from thyroid cancer received the placebo.

Table 31. Efficacy endpoints in RET positive patients and 17  patients with no RET mutation 
(M918T or other) identified 
• 
The  safety  profile  of  Caprelsa  in  RET  “negative”  patients  was  generally  consistent  with  what  was 
observed in the overall population of Study D4500C00058 and in patients having a RET mutation. 
No new safety signal was observed in RET “negative” patients. 
CSR amendment of Study OBS14778 (D4200C00104) 
Because Study OBS14778 was observational, the evaluation of objective response provided in the CSR 
was based on investigator assessment of imaging for all patients, including those coming from Study 
D4200C00058. Since the primary analysis of Study D4200C00058 was based on a blinded central review 
of  imaging,  the  MAH  thought  it  was  more  rigourous  to  reanalyse  the  objective  response  in  Study 
OBS14778 using the blinded central review dataset of study D4200C00058. 
Using this blinded central review data, 79 patients (instead of 75) were evaluable for analysis in Study 
OBS14778, 58 RET positive patients (instead of 55) and 21 RET negative patients (instead of 20). 
The objective response rate with Caprelsa remained lower in RET negative patients (9.5%) than in RET 
positive patients (39.7%). However, the median duration of treatment (24.42 months for RET negative 
vs 25.10 months for RET positive patients), the disease control rate (DCR, 85.7% for RET negative vs 
94.4% for RET positive patients) and the median PFS (35.71 months for RET negative vs 35.71 months 
for  RET  positive  patients)  did  not  seem  influenced  by  the  RET  status.  Treatment  with  Caprelsa  was 
associated  with  a  decrease  in  CTN,  which  was  delayed  in  RET  negative  versus  RET  positive  patients. 
There was also a decrease in CEA which was comparable in both RET negative and RET positive patients. 
At  2  years,  21%  of  RET  negative  patients  and  43%  of  RET  positive  patients  were  estimated  to  have 
disease progression. At the end of the follow-up period, one RET negative patient treated with Caprelsa 
had died due to disease progression (4.8%) versus 8 RET positive patients (13.8%). Lastly, the adverse 
event profile in RET negative patients was in agreement with that of RET positive patients and no new 
safety signal was identified. 
The MAH also performed a literature review related to Caprelsa, RET status and medullary thyroid cancer 
MTC. Several European academic teams published their own experience with Caprelsa in advanced MTC 
and noted that 27.6% to 68.3% of patients were long-term responders (median PFS values ranging from 
73.2  to  87  months)  [1-2].  Although  RET  negative  status  determined  by  next  generation  sequencing 
appears uncommon in sporadic MTC [3], long-term responders to Caprelsa are described in such patients 
[2]. Other institutions reported similar outcomes between RET negative and RET positive patients [4-5] 
but the high percentage of RET negative patients in these publications suggests the use of less advanced 
technologies for RET testing. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/30610/2023  
Page 80/94 
 
 
 
 
 
Considering  the  above-mentioned  clinical  and  literature  data,  discrepancies  in  RET  testing  quality 
between institutions as well as the lack of standard of care for RET negative patients, the MAH believes 
that Caprelsa should remain a treatment option for patients with aggressive, symptomatic, unresectable, 
locally advanced or metastatic MTC. The activity of Caprelsa may be less pronounced than that observed 
in RET positive patients in terms of objective response but remains numerically higher than placebo with 
an acceptable safety profile.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
In the response, the MAH refers to two additional CSR addendum. The first addendum concerns study 
D4500C00058  and  most  results  were  already  described  in  the  response  to  MO1  in  the  request  for 
supplementary information 2. In study D4500C00058, 17 RET negative patients were treated with either 
vandetanib  (n=11)  or  placebo  (n=6).  The  second  addendum  concerns  study  D4200C00104,  the 
observational study analysing pooled data from the D4500C00058 study and the observational data. In 
the previous data analysis from study D4200C00104 ORR was based on investigator assessment for all 
patients,  as  there  were  only  investigator  assessments  available  for  the  observational  patients.  In  the 
addendum, the MAH provided analyses based on blinded central review for the D500C00058 patients, 
the data from the patients included in the observational part did not change. Using the blinded central 
review data for the D500C00058 patients, 79 patients (instead of 75) were evaluable for analysis: 58 
RET positive patients (instead of 55) and 21 RET negative patients (instead of 20). 
In addition, the MAH refers to literature publications to support an indication for vandetanib irrespective 
of  RET  status.  Below,  the  main  efficacy  data  for  the  addenda  to  CSRs  for  D4500C00058  and 
D4200C00104 will be presented. Next, the provided literature references will be reviewed, followed by 
the Rapporteur’s assessment.

Addendum  CSR  D4200C00104  (observational  study;  planned  to  provide  confirmatory 
evidence for RET-negative patients as SpecOB): 
Because  study  D4200C00104  study  was  observational,  the  objective  response  was  based  on  the 
investigator  assessment  of  imaging  for  all  participants,  including  those  from  study  D4200C00058. 
However, the primary analysis of study D4200C00058 was based on a blinded central review. The MAH 
provided this addendum to present the results of the objective response from the blinded central review 
(in addition to the analysis per investigator assessment), in line with original CSR of study D4200C00058. 
Overall,  97  patients  were  screened  and  enrolled  in  the  study:  37  patients  prospectively  enrolled  (30 
patients  with  RET  positive  mutation  and  7  patients  with  RET  negative  mutation)  and  57  patients 
retrospectively  enrolled  (47  patients  coming  from  D4200C00058  randomised  study  with  re-evaluated 
RET mutation status [36 RET positive and 11 RET negative], and 10 patients with RET negative mutation 
retrospectively  enrolled  at  the  site  level).  Of  the  97  patients  enrolled,  79  patients  were  evaluable  for 
efficacy (81.4%) (all enrolled and eligible [i.e. exposed to vandetanib with known RET mutation status] 
and RECIST assessment evaluable at baseline). The remaining 18 patients (18.6%) were non-evaluable 
(11 [11.3%] patients had no evaluable baseline RECIST assessment, 6 [6.2%] patients did not meet 
eligibility criteria, and 1 [1.0%] patients did not take at least 1 dose of vandetanib). Of the 79 evaluable 
patients, there were 58 RET positive and 21 RET negative patients included in the analysis. 
Below the main efficacy tables will be shown. Compared to the previous results, there were 3 additional 
evaluable patients in the RET positive population and one additional evaluable patient in the RET negative 
population from study D4200C0058. The median duration of treatment with vandetanib was 23.4 months 
in the RET positive population and 27.6 months in the RET negative population. ORR in the RET positive 
population was 39.7% (compared to 41.8% previously) and in the RET negative population ORR was 
9.5% due to one additional responder in study D4200C0058 (compared to 5.0% previously) when using

blinded central review of for the patients in study D4200C0058. In total 2 out of 21 RET negative patients 
had  a  partial  response,  no  complete  responses  were  reported.  Per  investigator  evaluation  of  tumour 
response, ORR was 5.0% in the RET negative population with one responder. DCR was 87.9% (n=51) 
for RET positive patients and 85.7% (n=18) for RET negative participants. The median time to response 
was 5.52 months (range: 2.8 to 16.6 months) in RET positive patients and 5.52 months for RET negative 
patients. The median DOR was 19.6 months for RET positive and not estimable for RET negative patients. 
The median PFS was 25.4 months RET positive patients and 35.7 months in RET negative patients. At 
12  months,  22%  of  RET  positive  patients  and  21% of  RET  negative  patients  were  estimated  to  have 
progressed;  at  24  months,  43%  of  RET  positive  patients  and  21%  of  RET  negative  patients  were 
estimated to have progressed. Treatment with vandetanib was associated with a decrease in calcitonin 
(CTN),  which  appeared  more  rapidly  in  RET  positive  than  in  RET  negative  patients.  There  was  also  a 
decrease in carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels which was comparable in both RET positive and RET 
negative participants.

Literature: 
Lastly, the MAH refers to literature publications related to the use of vandetanib in MTC and RET status.  
The first publication by Ramos et al., 2020 is a retrospective clinical file review in a single center of 76 
patients  treated  with  vandetanib.  According  to  the  authors,  twelve  patients  (17.9%)  had  a  known 
germline RET mutation and the genetic status was undiscovered in eight patients. No further information 
is provided regarding RET status. 
Valerio  et  al.,  2020,  analysed  medical  records  for  79  patients  in  a  single  center.  In  72/79  patients, 
tumour  tissues  were  available  for  RET  genetic  analysis  which  was  performed  according  to  standard 
protocols (Elisei et al., 2019). In this study, the RET mutation gene was present in 100% of patients 
with the hereditary form and in almost 90% of sporadic cases. Among all RET mutations, the somatic 
RET  Met918Thr  mutation  was  the  most  represented.  In  the  presented  series,  the  presence  of  RET 
mutations was not a predictor of longer and/or better response to vandetanib. However, the very high 
prevalence of RET mutated cases and the correspondent low prevalence of non-mutated cases probably 
would require a much larger number of samples to reach statistical power according to the authors. Of 
note, the referred to publication by Elisei et al., 2019, describes RET analysis investigating RET mutations 
in eight exons (5, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 and 16). 
Ciampi et al., 2019 studied 181 cases of MTC by deep sequencing to define the mutational landscape. 
This  analysis  showed  that  55.8%  of  cases  harbored  RET  genetic  alterations,  confirming  that  RET, 
particularly the M918T mutation, is the main driver oncogene in MTC. The second main driver oncogene 
has been confirmed to be RAS, particularly HRAS and KRAS genes, which were altered in 24.3% of MTC 
cases.  Only  a  small  subgroup,  representing  only  1.6%  of  cases,  showed  other  types  of  uncommon 
mutations whose driver role remains unclear. The prevalence of complete negative cases in this series 
was 18.3% of cases, which increased up to 19.9% if the subgroup with the uncommon mutations was 
included. The authors found a strong correlation between the presence of RET mutations and a worse 
patient outcome, and the survival of Kaplan-Meier curves confirmed that patients with MTC harboring 
the RET mutation had a higher rate of cancer-related deaths than patients harboring RAS mutations. 
Pradhu et al., 2020, describe data from a single institution retrieved through a prospectively maintained 
thyroid cancer database from 1998 to June 2019. RET gene mutation status (exon 10–16) was assessed. 
Out of 149 peripheral blood samples, 42 were positive for RET gene mutation (prevalence of 28.1%). 
The  authors  did  not  find  a  statistically  significant  difference  between  RET  positive  and  RET  negative 
groups concerning OS and PFS. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/30610/2023  
Page 87/94 
 
 
 
 
 
The last publication was by Kim et al. 2020 and was already provided previously (see response to MO1 
the  request  for  supplementary  information  1).  RET  genetic  screening  was  performed  in  nine  patients 
(75%), and the majority of patients (8/9, 89%) were not carrying a RET mutation. A germline mutation 
in the RET gene (p.D878Y) was identified in one patient. Efficacy results were not provided separately 
for RET positive or RET negative patients. Partial response was observed in five patients (ORR, 42%). 
Assessment: 
The MAH concludes that based on the provided clinical and literature data, discrepancies in RET testing 
quality between institutions as well as the lack of standard of care for RET negative patients, vandetanib 
should  remain  a  treatment  option  for  patients  with  aggressive,  symptomatic,  unresectable,  locally 
advanced or metastatic MTC. 
In  the  response,  the  MAH  provided  the  appendices  to  CSRs  of  both  the  RCT  D4200C0058  and  the 
observational study D4200C00104. Study D4200C00104 includes data from the RET negative population 
of  the  RCT  D4200C0058  and  from  retrospectively  collected  RET  negative  patients.  Due  to  the  study 
design of D4200C00104, it is considered that ORR and DoR should be the focus as efficacy measures, 
because of the difficulties interpreting time-dependent endpoints of a non-controlled observational study. 
Furthermore, the focus will be on the activity in RET negative patients as a comparison between RET 
positive and RET negative patients is considered to be less relevant. Even a lower activity in RET negative 
patients compared to RET positive patients could still be relevant and it should be assessed whether the 
activity in RET negative patients specifically is clinically relevant for a positive B/R balance. 
In study D4200C0058, objective tumour response was observed in 18.2% (2/11) RET-negative patients 
treated with vandetanib versus none of those treated with placebo (0/6). Both responders had a partial 
response  and  were  RAS  mutation  positive.  Disease  control  rate  was  72.7%  (8/11)  in  vandetanib  and 
100% (6/6) in the placebo group. Median DOR could not be predicted in RET negative patients. 
As agreed previously, the data from the RET negative population in study D4200C0058 will be pooled 
with  the  RET  negative  patients  from  the  observational  study,  in  study  D4200C00104  to  provide  a 
sufficient number of patients in order to be able to fulfill the SOB. In the pooled RET negative population 
ORR was 9.5% using central assessment of the patients in study D4200C0058 (2/21 with PR) or 5.0% 
using  investigator  assessment  of  the  patients  in  study  D4200C0058  (1/20  PR).  Median  DOR  was  not 
estimable for the RET negative population. The one responder per investigator assessment is different 
(E1201002) than the two responders per central review (E1001011 and E1701002). Per central review, 
patient E1201002 had stable disease (see response to OC#2 in the previous round). It should also be 
noted  that  for  the  patients  in  the  observational  part,  only  investigator  assessment  is  available.  It  is, 
therefore, preferred to analyse all patients per investigator assessment.  
Regarding  the  literature  overview  provided  by  the  MAH,  it  is  unknown  how  the  literature  review  was 
performed, for example the search and selection strategy are not described. In addition, the methods of 
RET  testing  differed  between  the  literature  articles  and,  therefore,  the  provided  literature  cannot  be 
considered supportive to determine on a positive B/R in RET negative patients. 
As  discussed  previously,  the  low  number  of  patients  in  the  RET  negative  group  make  it  difficult  to 
compare with the RET positive subgroup. It seems that vandetanib treatment is at least not more toxic 
in RET negative patients compared to RET positive patients. 
Summarising, the B/R of the RET negative population at time of CMA was based on a population that 
was  mainly  not  RET  negative  after  re-analysis.  In  a  pooled  set  of  21  or  20  RET-negative  patients 
depending on the used tumour assessment, the response rate is at best 9.5% and DOR is not estimable. 
It is unlikely that the reported response rate of 9.5 or 5% in RET negative patients will translate into a 
clinical benefit. Combined with the known toxicity profile of vandetanib and that RET testing is expected

to  play  a  more  and  more  important  role  in  MTC  given  the  developments  in  treatments  specifically 
targeting RET, the benefits do not outweigh the risks in the RET negative population and the indication 
should be restricted to RET positive patients (MO), in which the B/R remains positive.

Question 2 
The pooled RET negative sample consisted of 10 patients from study D4200C00058 and 10 patients from 
study OBS14778/D4200C00104 (7 recruited prospectively and 3 patients retrospectively). One of the 
patients from the D4200C00058 was excluded from the pooled analysis, because RECIST evaluation at 
baseline was lacking. The MAH is requested to confirm this concerns the assessment by investigator and 
the reason why this was not performed or resolved during the study. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
As explained in the answer to question 1, the MAH reanalyzed study OBS14778 using the blinded central 
review listing of Study D4200C00058. 
Using this dataset, all 11 RET negative patients treated with Caprelsa in Study D4200C00058 are now 
evaluable for efficacy analysis. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH did not reply to the question directly, but refers to the MO where a re-analysis based on blinded 
central review is presented. This issue will not be pursued further. 
Conclusion 
 Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly 
 No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance 
Question 3 
Discrepancies were noted for the number reported in the D4200C00058 study. One of the discrepancies 
concerns the number of patients that had “unknown” RET status at time of  CMA based on initial RET 
analysis.  According  to  the  EPAR  this  number  was  138,  but  Appendix  1  reports  136  patients  with 
“unknown” RET status. Another discrepancy that is noted, is the number of RET negative patients after 
the re-analysis. The MAH describes that re-analysis was performed for RET mutation status “unknown” 
samples  (n=67),  previously  RET  negative  samples  (n=2),  and  previously  RET  positive  (n=4).  The 
reanalysis confirmed the four previously RET positive patients to be RET positive, and 1 of 2 previously 
RET negative patients was found to be RET positive. Out of the 67 RET unknown patients re-analyzed, 
52 were reclassified as RET positive and 15 were found to be RET negative. In total, 17 patients were

EMA/CHMP/30610/2023

found to be RET negative according to the MAH. However, the number of 17 RET negative patients is not 
understood as 15 RET negative samples out of the previously unknown set and 1 RET negative patients 
out of the previously RET negative set adds up to 16. The MAH is requested to clarify these discrepancies, 
adjust the numbers if needed, and to discuss the consequences for the interpretation of the results. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Of 331 patients randomized in Study D4200C00058, all but 2 patients (ie n=329) provided an archived 
tissue sample for RET mutation analysis. As mentioned on page 38 of the EPAR (EMA128076, dated 17 
November 2011), RET mutation status was determined to be positive in 187 (56.5%) patients, negative 
in 8 patients (2.4%), and unknown in 136 (41.1%) patients. The 2 patients who had no tissue available 
are included in those 136 patients with unknown RET status (they should not be added to them). 
Of  79  patients  lacking  M918T  mutation  in  Study  D4200C00058,  69 had  enough  tissue  for  RET  status 
reanalysis (2/8 patients previously classified as RET negative and 67/71 patients previously classified as 
RET “unknown”): 
• Among RET “unknown” patients reanalyzed (n=67), 51 (instead of 52) were reclassified as RET positive 
and 16 (instead of 15) were found to be RET negative. 
• Among RET negative patients reanalyzed (n=2), one was confirmed to be RET negative and the other 
one was reclassified as RET positive. 
Thus, in total, 17 patients (16 plus 1) were found to be RET negative and 52 patients (51 plus 1) were 
reclassified as RET positive. 
The MAH does apologize for the mistake. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The  number  of  patients  with  “unknown”  RET  status  at  time  of  CMA  based  on  initial  RET  analysis  is 
clarified: 136 had unknown RET status and 2 had not enough tissue to assess the RET status. 
Regarding the number of RET negative patients, there was apparently a mistake and in total 17 patients 
had RET negative status in study D4200C00058. Of the patients with RET “unknown” status, 16 (instead 
of  the  previously  reported  15)  were  RET  negative.  In  addition,  1  of  the  RET  negative  patients  was 
confirmed to be RET negative. Of the 17 RET negative patients, 11 were treated with vandetanib and 6 
with placebo. The mistake does not impact the efficacy data. 
The discrepancies are explained and the issue will not be further pursued.

Question 1 
Efficacy of vandetanib has not been established in patients with RET negative status. Having in mind the 
known  substantial  toxicity,  the  B/R  balance  is  negative  for  these  patients.  The  MAH  is  requested  to 
restrict the indication to RET mutant patients. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The  MAH  acknowledges  the  CHMP  conclusion  that  the  positive  benefit/risk  profile  of  vandetanib 
established in RET mutant patients with aggressive and symptomatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), is 
not sufficiently demonstrated in RET negative patients after reviewing the data from: 
• 
• 
The  re-analysis  of  the  RET  status  in  69  patients  lacking  M918T  mutation  in  the  double-blind, 
randomized,  placebo-controlled  Study  D4500C00058  (also  referred  as  Study  58).  Of  these  69 
patients, 52 were reclassified as RET mutant and only 17 patients were confirmed to be RET negative 
(14 of them being RAS mutant). 
The  observational  PASS  study  (OBS14778),  which  enrolled  21  evaluable  RET  negative  patients 
treated with vandetanib, 11 coming from the randomized Study 58. 
With reference to our response to previous request for supplementary information, despite the overall 
low number of RET negative patients described above, the MAH considers that the benefit/risk balance 
of vandetanib remains positive, regardless of RET status, for the following reasons: 
•  Vandetanib is indicated for patients with aggressive and symptomatic MTC  which is unresectable, 
locally advanced or metastatic. 
The  objective  tumor  response  rate  with  vandetanib  was  numerically  higher  than  placebo  in  the 
randomized Study 58: 
−  2/11 patients (18.2%) treated with vandetanib had an objective tumor response versus 0/6 
patients (0%) treated with placebo. 
−  Both RET negative patients having an objective response with vandetanib were RAS mutant 
(ie 22.2% of all RAS mutant patients treated with vandetanib). 
Progression-free survival (PFS) was longer in RET negative than in RET mutant patients, in Study 58 
• 
• 
as in the PASS Study: 
− 
− 
In Study 58, hazard ratio (HR) for PFS (primary end-point) was 0.21 [95% CI, 0.03-1.56] 
in RET negative patients versus 0.46 [95% CI, 0.29-0.74] in RET mutant patients. At 2 years, 
10%  of  RET  negative  patients  and  44%  of  RET  mutant  patients  had  progressed  with 
vandetanib. 
In the PASS Study, PFS with vandetanib was 35.7 months in RET negative patients versus 
25.4 months in RET mutant patients. At 2 years, 21% of RET negative patients and 43% of 
RET mutant patients had progressed with vandetanib. 
•  Disease control rate and duration of treatment were comparable in RET negative and RET positive 
patients. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/30610/2023  
Page 92/94 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
In Study 58, the only RET negative patient who died from thyroid cancer received the placebo. In 
the PASS Study, cancer death was lower in RET negative patients (4.8%) than in RET mutant patients 
(13.8%). 
The safety profile of vandetanib was not influenced by RET status in Study 58 as in the PASS Study. 
Whilst acknowledging the CHMP request to restrict the indication to RET mutant patients, the MAH would 
like to highlight the following important implications for patients with MTC: 
•  Many  European  countries  do  not  have  any  treatment  alternative  to  vandetanib  for  MTC.  Indeed, 
cabozantinib is registered in Europe regardless of RET status but is not reimbursed for MTC in most 
European countries (see table below). 
•  Most recent technologies to determine RET status are not available or not reimbursed everywhere 
since RET testing is not yet standard practice in Europe. 
MAH  would  like  to  also  specify  that  it  has  been  made  aware  that  a  network  in  France  is  currently 
conducting a retrospective study evaluating clinical outcomes in RET negative patients with unresectable 
metastatic  or  locally  advanced  MTC. It is estimated that 200-250 patients have metastatic MTC will be 
enrolled in the database and data is collected from 2000 to 2020.  
MAH  believes  that  this  retrospective  study  could  provide  valuable  information  in  completion  of  the 
available data to support the benefit/risk of vandetanib in RET negative patients. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/30610/2023  
Page 93/94 
 
 
 
 
 
 
However, considering the results of the study is presently not available, MAH accepts the CHMP request 
to restrict the indication to RET mutant patients in order, to close the current procedure and to lift the 
SOB and the conditional MA in EU. 
Once the study results become available, the MAH will review the data to assess a potential new variation 
submission to update the indication. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH restricted the indication to RET mutant positive patients as requested. In the population with 
RET mutant positive patients, the B/R is considered to remain positive. With reference to the assessment 
of all available data in the previous round(s), in the RET mutant negative patients the benefits do not 
outweigh the risks. In a pooled set of 21 or 20 patients, pending on the used tumour assessment, the 
response rate is at best 9.5% and DOR is not estimable. It is unlikely that the reported response rate of 
9.5  or  5%  in  RET  mutation  negative  patients  will  translate  into  a  clinical  benefit.  Combined  with  the 
known  toxicity  profile  of  vandetanib,  this  renders  the  B/R  negative  in  the  RET  mutation  negative 
population. 
The retrospective study in unresectable metastatic or locally advanced MTC is noted. Noting that RET 
testing  is  expected  to  play  a  more  and  more  important  role  in  MTC  and  given  the  developments  in 
treatments targeting RET, the results from this study are considered of interest. Whether the results will 
be  able  to  support  a  positive  B/R  in  RET  mutation  negative  patients  will  in  the  end  be  a  matter  of 
assessment and pending on, amongst others, the sample size, used method of RET mutation testing and 
tumour assessment, and predefined statistical analysis plan. 
Issue  resolved,  pending  resolution  of  the  remaining  SmPC  comments.  Please  refer  to  the 
separate SmPC assessment.

Updated assessment 
The MAH provided an updated SmPC that resolved part, but not all of the issues, while an additional 
comment is made that the PIL should also reflect the restricted indication. Please refer to the separate 
updated SmPC assessment. 
In  addition,  the  MAH  was  requested  to  provide  a  draft  DHPC  and  communication  plan  regarding  the 
restricted indication. The assessment of the DHPC and communication plan is provided in the separate 
documentation. The Co-Rapp’s assessment (in the lead for this procedure) is endorsed by the CHMP and

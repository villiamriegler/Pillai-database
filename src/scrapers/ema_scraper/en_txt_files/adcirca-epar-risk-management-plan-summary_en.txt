Part VI: Summary of the Risk Management Plan 
Summary of Risk Management Plan for Cialis (tadalafil) 
This is a summary of the RMP for Cialis®. The RMP details important risks of Cialis, how these 
risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about Cialis’s risks and 
uncertainties (missing information). 
Cialis’s SmPC and its package leaflet give essential information to healthcare professionals and 
patients on how Cialis should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Cialis should be read in the context of all this information, 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all of which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Cialis’s 
RMP. 
I - The Medicine and What It is Used for 
Cialis is authorised for erectile dysfunction (ED), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), ED and 
BPH (ED/BPH) (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains tadalafil as the active substance 
and it is given by oral administration. 
Further information about the evaluation of Cialis’s benefits can be found in Cialis’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines Agency (EMA) 
website, under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/cialis. 
II - Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or 
Further Characterise the Risks 
Important risks of Cialis, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies 
for learning more about Cialis’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.

II.A List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of Cialis/Adcirca/Tadalafil Lilly are risks that need special risk management 
activities to further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
taken. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Cialis/Adcirca/Tadalafil Lilly. Potential 
risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on 
available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation.

Introduction 
On 12 December 2014, the MAH submitted a paediatric study for lipegfilgrastim, in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
The study has been completed in accordance with an approved ongoing paediatric investigation plan 
(EMEA-001019- PIP01-10-M02). The current submission includes the clinical study report based on the 
end of treatment assessment. The follow up period for the study is still ongoing and an addendum to 
cover the follow up period (immunogenicity data) will be submitted separately.  
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
The MAH has not recommended any changes to the product information on the basis of the submitted 
clinical study report.  
1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that the study to assess the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy, safety, 
tolerability and immunogenicity of a single subcutaneous dose of XM22 in 21 children undergoing dose-
intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy for Ewing Family of Tumours or Rhabdomyosarcoma (Study XM22-
07) is part of an ongoing paediatric investigation plan. The variation application consisting of the full 
relevant paediatric data package (i.e. containing several studies) is expected to be submitted by 
04/18. A line listing of all the concerned studies is annexed. 
1.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
XM22 was supplied in clear glass vials containing 1mL of a 10mg/mL solution for subcutaneous 
injection, specifically developed for the XM22 paediatric studies. The drug product is a sterile, 
colourless to pale yellow preservative-free solution of XM22 with excipients (acidic sodium acetate 
buffer, sorbitol, polysorbate 20 and water for injection). A fine graded syringe (0.01mL graduations) 
was to be used for injection. After the syringe was filled with XM22, a new 29G x ½ inch needle was to 
be used for injection, preferably into the abdominal region. The maximum dose was to be 6mg as this 
is the fixed dose for adults. 
Teva Pharmaceuticals Europe B.V., The Netherlands was responsible for manufacturing the XM22 
solution.

1.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study XM22-07; a multicentre, open label study to assess the 
pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy, safety, tolerability and 
immunogenicity of a single subcutaneous dose of 100µg/kg XM22 in 21 
children with Ewing family of tumours or rhabdomyosarcoma  
Description 
Methods 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to assess the pharmacokinetics of a single subcutaneous injection of XM22, 
100µg/kg body weight, in children with Ewing family of tumours or rhabdomyosarcoma. 
Secondary objectives were to assess the pharmacodynamics, efficacy, safety, tolerability and 
immunogenicity of this single dose in the same patient population.  
Study design 
This phase 1 study included a screening period and a 3-week treatment and assessment period. The 
end of study visit to mark the end of the treatment period was conducted at 21 days post dose.  In the 
follow-up period, immunogenicity samples were obtained at approximately 180 and 360 days post 
administration of XM22. The study initiation date (first patient screened) was 9 September 2012 and 
study completion was 15 May 2014. The end of the follow up period to obtain immunogenicity samples 
is expected in April 2015. 
The MAH states that the study was conducted in accordance with ICH guidelines, GCP and the 
Declaration of Helsinki.  
Study population /Sample size 
Children aged 2 to <18 years, diagnosed with Ewing family of tumours or rhabdomyosarcoma and 
scheduled to receive one of a specified list of chemotherapy regimens, were enrolled. The possible 
chemotherapy regimens were as follows, all administered with concomitant sodium 2-mercaptoethane 
sulfonate (MESNA) according to local standards: 
Ewings- 
•  Vincristine, ifosfamide, doxorubicin and etoposide (VIDE)  
•  Vincristine, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, alternating with ifosfamide plus etoposide 
(VDC/IE) 
Rhabdomyosarcoma- 
•  Vincristine, actinomycin D and cyclophosphamide (VAC) 
•  VDC/IE 
• 
Ifosfamide, vincristine and actinomycin D (IVA; added by Amendment 3, after enrolment of 15 
patients) 
Adequate body weight (≥15kg for the 2 higher age groups and ≥12.5kg for the 2 to <6 years group) 
and haematological parameters were required. The requirement for patients to be chemotherapy naïve 
Page 3/20 
 
 
 
 
 
was removed by Amendment 4, effective after enrolment of 18 patients. Patients with exposure to any 
granulocyte-colony stimulating factors (G-CSFs) within the previous 6 months were excluded as were 
those with active infection or a history of infection in the 2 weeks prior to screening. Prior bone marrow 
or stem cell transplant were exclusion factors.  
A total of 21 patients were planned for enrolment, stratified into 3 equal- sized groups by age (2 to <6 
years, 6 to <12 years and 12 to <18 years). Recruitment of patients in the youngest age group was to 
begin only after the results of the PD and safety data for the two higher-age strata had been reviewed 
by the Data Monitoring Committee, composed of 3 independent paediatric oncology experts.  
Treatments 
A phase 1 study in healthy adults (XM22-01-CH) used a 100µg/kg body weight dose of XM22, which 
approximates the 6mg dose selected for use in adult patients. It was expected that the same weight 
adjusted dose would produce plasma levels of XM22 in children similar to those observed in adults. 
Therefore, a single dose of 100µg/kg XM22 (batch numbers 1016122 and 1005510) up to a maximum 
of 6mg was administered subcutaneously 24 hours (±3 hours) after the end of the last chemotherapy 
treatment in week 1 of the regimen. XM22 administration was to occur generally on day 4 with VIDE 
chemotherapy, day 3 with VDA or IVA and day 2, 3, 4 or 6 with VAC (dependent on the actinomycin 
and cyclophosphamide regimens). Commercially available G-CSFs were not to be administered during 
the study treatment period but could be administered for subsequent chemotherapy cycles during the 
follow-up period at the discretion of the investigator.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
Pharmacokinetics:  
Samples for PK assessments were obtained pre-dose and periodically for up to 240 hours (144 hours in 
the lowest age group) after XM22 administration. PK parameters were: 
•  AUC0-tlast 
•  AUC0-inf 
•  Cmax 
• 
• 
• 
Tmax 
λz (rate constant associated with the terminal phase) 
t1/2 
•  MRT (mean residual time) 
•  CL/F (apparent clearance) 
•  %AUC (% of extrapolated area in relation to the total AUC) 
•  Vz/F (apparent volume of distribution during the terminal phase) 
Secondary endpoints 
Efficacy: The primary efficacy measure was the incidence of febrile neutropaenia in cycle 1, defined as 
axillary or external ear temperature >38.3°C or 2 consecutive readings >37.8°C at least 2 hours apart 
and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <0.5 x 109/L. Secondary efficacy variables were incidence and 
Page 4/20 
 
 
 
 
 
duration of severe neutropaenia (ANC<0.5 x 109/L) and of very severe neutropaenia (ANC <0.1 x 
109/L).  
Safety: Safety was assessed by adverse events, results of clinical laboratory tests, vital sign values 
(blood pressure, pulse and temperature), central evaluation of 12 lead electrocardiograms, physical 
examination findings, monitoring of concomitant medication, splenic sonography, local injection site 
tolerability and immunogenicity.  
Pharmacodynamics:  
Samples for PD assessments (ANC and CD34+) were obtained prior to chemotherapy on day 1 (with 
exceptions for patients in the lowest age group weighing <15kg), prior to XM22 administration and 
periodically for 12 or 15 days thereafter, dependent on weight. PD endpoints included: 
•  ANC nadir (measured in days) 
• 
• 
Time to ANC nadir, from the beginning of chemotherapy 
Time to ANC recovery to ≥1.0 x 109/L and to ≥2.0 x 109/L from nadir and from first 
chemotherapy 
•  Circulating CD34+ cells AOBEC (area over baseline effect curve) 
•  Circulating CD34+ AUC 
•  CD34+max (maximum observed value of CD34+ cells in blood samples) 
•  CD34+Tmax (time to reach maximum CD34+ cell count)  
Statistical Methods 
This was a phase 1, non-comparative study and no statistical assumption was used to select the 
sample size. 21 patients were considered sufficient to allow exploratory analysis. No randomization or 
blinding was used but the study was designed to recruit patients into 3 groups stratified by age. Study 
results were reported by age group and by type of chemotherapy received. PK parameters were to be 
calculated for each subject using non-compartmental analysis of serum XM22 concentration time data, 
employing Phoenix WinNonlin® version 6.1 or later. Summary statistics were to be provided for the 
observed data only. For the purpose of calculating secondary efficacy variables, missing ANC values 
were to be estimated using linear interpolation, performed between the first and last available ANC 
measurements during cycle 1. Imputation of missing variables was to be performed only if at least 3 
non-missing ANC values, including baseline, were available. Missing ANC values at the end were 
imputed using the LOCF method, particularly for patients in the youngest age group with body weight 
<15kg for whom values from days 13 – 15 were imputed using LOCF from day 12. 
It was initially planned to analyse all immunogenicity samples on completion of follow-up, but, to avoid 
stability issues, the samples from the older age group have been analysed. Samples from the youngest 
age group will be analysed in a second batch run after completion of the follow-up period of all patients 
in that age group.  
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Of the 17 centres activated for this study, 12 centres screened 23 paediatric patients and 11 centres 
21 enrolled patients in 5 countries (Czech Republic [1 patient], Hungary [4 patients], Poland [1 
patient], Russia [4 centres, 7 patients] and Ukraine [4 centres, 8 patients]); 2 patients were not 
Page 5/20 
 
 
 
 
 
enrolled on the basis of inclusion criteria (age and weight). No patient withdrew from the study or 
discontinued evaluation during the treatment period of 21 days following the dose of XM22. Data from 
all 21 patients were evaluated for PK, efficacy, pharmacodynamic parameters and safety (Full Analysis 
Set, Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set and Safety Analysis Set were identical). The Per Protocol Set 
included all patients in the Safety Analysis Set for whom no major protocol violations were reported 
and was used, along with the FAS, to evaluate efficacy and PD. There were 20 patients in the Per 
Protocol Set; one patient in the 2 to <6 years group was excluded due to missing ANC and CD34+ 
values from the central laboratory (clotted biosamples received).  
Baseline data 
Overall the study enrolled slightly more male than female patients.

Medical history of cancer varied across the age groups. In the 2 to <6 years group, most patients (6/7, 
85.7%) were diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma, whilst in the older age groups most were diagnosed 
with Ewing family of tumour (5/7, 71.4% and 6/7, 85.7% in the 6 to <12 years and 12 to < 18 years 
groups respectively). The majority of these were Ewing tumour of bone but there was a single case of 
peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumour (PPNET) in each of the two older age groups.   
By type of chemotherapy: 12 patients, all with Ewings, received VIDE. Of the 9 patients with 
rhabdomyosarcoma, 5 received IVA and 4 received VAC chemotherapy. Distribution of chemotherapy 
was uneven across age groups according to cancer type. In the 2 to <6 years group, most patients 
received IVA chemotherapy (5/7, 71.4%), 1 received VAC and 1 VIDE chemotherapy. Most patients in 
Page 6/20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the older age groups received VIDE (5/7, 71.4% and 6/7, 85.7% in the 6 to <12 years and 12 to <18 
years groups respectively) and the remaining 3 patients received VAC.

The majority of patients reported a history of surgery (17/21, 81%) whilst none had a history of 
radiotherapy. The mean time from diagnosis was 0.32 months.  
ECOG performance status was assessed for the 7 patients in the older age group and all were PS 0 (3 
patients) or 1 (4 patients).  
Results 
PK results: 
On average, XM22 was rapidly absorbed following subcutaneous administration in each age group, with 
peak exposure levels being maintained over a prolonged period of time (days) due to nonlinear PK 
behaviour. Maximum serum XM22 concentration was reached at 50.3 hours (292 ± 178 ng/mL) in the 
2 to <6 years group, 45.4 hours (303 ± 144 ng/mL) in the 6 to <12 years group and 82.2 hours (341 
± 381 ng/mL) in the 12 to <18 years group (see figure 1). The corresponding geometric means 
(coefficients of variation) of Cmax for the age groups were 243 ng/mL (61.0%), 256 ng/mL (47.5%) 
and 225 ng/mL (111.6%) respectively.  
The higher dispersion coefficient for the 12 to <18 years group is likely due to the unusually high XM22 
concentration measured for patient  (see Figure 2), in whom the XM22 serum concentration reached a 
maximum within 3 hours after dosing and declined rapidly thereafter, giving the appearance of 
alternate (e.g. intravenous) method of administration.

As PK sampling in the youngest age group stopped at 144 hours after XM22 administration, full PK 
parameters could be derived for only 3 of the 7 younger patients. This made meaningful comparison 
across the age groups difficult for most of the PK parameters (Table 3). Analysis of variance revealed 
no detectable difference in PK parameters of interest [Cmax (p=0.9560), AUC0-t (p= 0.4130), Vz/F 
(p=0.7125), CL/F (0.6038)} among age groups. The average Cmax values and Cmax variability were 
comparable across age groups.

Efficacy results: 
Results for febrile neutropaenia according to investigator definition (information provided in the CRF) 
were reported for the Full Analysis Set (21 patients); results according to protocol definition (vital signs 
and central laboratory test results) were reported for the Per Protocol Set (20 patients).  
The percentage of patients who experienced febrile neutropaenia increased with the age of the cohort 
(Table 4).

In the Full Analysis Set, of the 8 patients who experienced febrile neutropaenia, 7 received VIDE and 1 
received IVA chemotherapy. In the Per Protocol Set, all 4 patients who experienced febrile 
neutropaenia received VIDE chemotherapy.  
Three patients received prophylactic antibiotics prior to XM22 and 2 patients received antipyretic 
medications that could mask febrile neutropaenia. None of these 5 patients experienced febrile 
neutropaenia. Of the remaining 16 patients, 8 experienced febrile neutropaenia based on investigator 
definition.  
In the Per Protocol Set, 14/20 patients (70%) experienced severe neutropaenia (ANC <0.5x109/L), 
including all 12 who received VIDE and 2/4 who received VAC chemotherapy. None of the 4 patients 
(all 2 to <6 years) who received IVA experienced severe neutropaenia. The most frequent duration of 
neutropaenia in the Per Protocol Set was 3 to 4 days (7/20, 35%), followed by 1 to 2 days (5/20, 
25%) and 5 to 6 days (2/20, 10%). In the Per Protocol Set, the mean (SD) duration of severe 
neutropaenia was 0.7 (1.2) days in the 2 to <6 years group, 2.4 (1.9) days in the 6 to <12 years 
group and 3.1 (1.9) days in the 12 to <18 years group. 
In the Full Analysis Set, 4 patients experienced very severe neutropaenia (ANC <0.1 x 109/L), all of 
whom received VIDE chemotherapy; 1 in the 6 to <12 years group and 3 in the 12 to <18 years 
group. For 3 patients this lasted 1 to 2 days and for 1 patient the event lasted 3 to 4 days.  
Pharmacodynamic results 
PD results were analysed for patients in the Full Analysis Set using ANC and CD34+ measurements. 
Absolute Neutrophil Counts 
The mean ANC nadir was higher for the youngest compared with the older age groups (Table 5). 
Again, this might be explained by the fact that the 2 to <6 years group received predominantly IVA 
chemotherapy, which is known to have less of a myelosuppressive effect than either VAC or VIDE.

The mean time to ANC nadir from the start of chemotherapy was longer for the youngest age group 
compared with the older groups: 10.2 ±3.6 days for the 2 to <6 years group, compared with 8.3 ±1.9 
days for the 6 to <12 years group and 8.6 ±0.8 days for the 12 to <18 years group.

The mean time to ANC recovery from the start of chemotherapy and from ANC nadir were both shorter 
for the youngest age group, as might be expected when starting from a higher mean nadir (Table 6).

The mean maximum CD34+ count was higher with the older age group and for those in the VIDE 
group (Table 7). The mean time to maximum CD34+ count from the start of chemotherapy was 
shorter for younger than older patients (9.7 ± 2.3 days, 11.7 ± 2.8 days and 14.9 ± 3.5 days 
respectively) and for IVA (8.5 ±1.7 days) compared to VAC (9.8 ±2.5 days) and VIDE (14.3 ±2.7

days). The mean CD34+ area over the baseline effect curve also increased progressively by age group, 
as did the mean of the CD34+ area under the curve. A p value of 0.8831 indicated no significant 
difference between age groups for the CD34+ area under the curve. 
In adults, XM22 appears to be mainly eliminated by neutrophil-mediated clearance; XM22 elimination 
becomes saturated under conditions of myelosuppression and the serum concentration declines slowly 
during the chemotherapy-induced transient neutrophil nadir and rapidly as the neutrophil pool is 
replenished. The results in this study are considered to be consistent with a neutrophil-mediated 
clearance mechanism in the paediatric population (Figure 6).

scale, overall; Full Analysis Set 
Safety results 
Extent of exposure 
The range of body-weight adjusted doses administered was 98.4 to 102.6µg/kg, giving compliance 
close to 100% for all patients (range 98.4 to 105.0%). Mean absolute doses administered were 
1.76mg, 3.68 mg and 4.58 mg respectively for the 3 age groups. Two patients received doses of XM22 
slightly in excess of the maximum 6mg permitted (6.24 and 6.3mg) but consistent with their body 
weights (62.4 and 63.0kg respectively).  
Adverse events 
No deaths or treatment related serious adverse events occurred in this study and no patient withdrew 
from the study during the 21 day treatment period following the single dose of XM22. 
During the treatment period, all 21 patients reported at least 1 adverse event with a total of 142 
events reported. Twenty (95.2%) patients experienced 102 treatment-emergent adverse events. 
Almost twice as many AEs were reported in the 12 to <18 years group compared with the 2 to <6 
years group (59 and 33 events respectively) and 50 events were reported in the 6 to < 12 years 
group. The most frequently occurring treatment-emergent adverse event in all age groups was 
neutropaenia [11/21 patients, 52.4%] (Table 8).

Table 8: Treatment- emergent adverse events occurring in at least 2 patients by MedDRA 
System Organ Class and MedDRA Preferred term (Safety Analysis Set) 
One 14 year old male patient who received VIDE chemotherapy experienced a treatment emergent 
adverse event of acute renal failure; this event was assessed as mild in severity, not an SAE, 
recovered/ resolved after 2 days and was assessed by the investigator as having no reasonable 
possibility of being related to XM22 treatment. 
A total of 3 adverse events in 2 patients were considered by investigators to be XM22-related. One 
patient was in the 2 to <6 years group (neutrophil count increased) and 1 patient was in the 6 to <12 
years group (back pain and bone pain). These 3 events were all mild in severity and consistent with 
the known safety profile of XM22.  
Three patients had 1 or more serious adverse events (SAEs) during this study; 1 patient in the 6 to 
<12 years group and 2 patients in the 12 to <18 years group. All SAEs reported were febrile 
neutropaenia, either alone or in addition to neutropaenia, and were considered serious due to 
hospitalisation being required. All 3 patients received VIDE chemotherapy at the same study site in 
Hungary.

Shifts in serum chemistry toxicity grades from baseline to end of study were small, infrequent and 
consistent with the known potential effects of XM22 (e.g. hypokalaemia, increased alkaline 
phosphatase). One 4 year old boy experienced a Grade 3 rise in alkaline phosphatase (from 90 to 
684U/L). Changes in haematology parameters were consistent with the known pharmacodynamic 
effects of XM22, the effect of chemotherapy and blood sampling in patients with low body weight. 
Spleen enlargement is a known complication of GCSF treatment. The splenic sonography assessments 
were normal for all patients at baseline and on day 3 after XM22 administration. At the end of study, 
abnormal spleen assessments were recorded for 3 patients at 20, 18 and 19 days (all in the 2 to <6 
years group). None of these abnormalities were determined to be clinically significant.  
No patient experienced an injection site reaction.

QT evaluation was complicated by the concomitant administration of medications known to prolong the 
QT interval, including doxorubicin, ondansetron, itraconozole and co-trimoxazole. The mean increases 
seen were assessed in the report as likely due to the cardiotoxic effect of the chemotherapy and other 
circumstances not related to XM22 e.g. blood loss due to sampling. ECG evaluation demonstrated no 
meaningful drug-induced PR interval and QRS duration prolongation or other clinically relevant 
abnormalities following XM22 administration.  Overall it was concluded that the central ECG 
assessment of the change from baseline QTcF duration did not indicate any QTc liability for XM22.

1.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The maximum mean XM22 concentration (Cmax) was reached at 50.3 hours (292 ± 178ng/mL) in the 
2 to <6 years group, 45.4 hours (303 ± 144 ng/mL) in the 6 to <12 years group and 82.2 hours (341 
± 381 ng/mL) in the 12 to < 18 years group. The corresponding geometric means of Cmax 
(coefficients of variation) for the age groups were 243 ng/mL (61.0%), 255ng/mL (47.5%) and 224 
ng/mL (111.6%) respectively. The average Cmax values were comparable across age groups, 
supporting the use of a body-weight adjusted dose to achieve comparable initial peak exposure levels 
of XM22. Overall the PK data supported the continued use of a 100µg/kg dose of XM22 in the 
paediatric population.  
The incidence of febrile neutropaenia varied according to age, with the highest frequency in the oldest 
age group. The incidence of neutropaenia and duration of severe neutropaenia were also greatest in 
the oldest age group. Most patients in the older age groups received VIDE (5/7, 71.4% and 6/7, 
85.7% in the 6 to <12 years and 12 to <18 years groups respectively), whilst the youngest cohort 
mainly received IVA. IVA is known to be less myelosuppressive than either VAC or VIDE. All 12 
patients who received VIDE experienced severe neutropaenia and the 4 cases of very severe 
neutropaenia were post VIDE chemotherapy. The mean duration of severe neutropaenia was longer 
after VIDE (3.4 days vs 0.5 days with VAC and 0 days with IVA). As the chemotherapy administered 
differed across age groups, no clear conclusion can be drawn regarding a relationship between febrile 
neutropaenia and patient age.  
Differences in the ANC and CD34+ count were mainly associated with the type of chemotherapy but in 
an inverse fashion. Lowest ANC counts were observed in the VIDE group, whereas the highest CD34+ 
counts were observed with this chemotherapy. This may indicate that, during the recovery phase, the 
formation of neutrophils is more inhibited by myelosuppressive chemotherapy than the formation or 
release of CD34+ cells. The mean ANC nadir was higher for the youngest age group which may again 
be related to the different chemotherapy regimens; IVA is less myelosuppressive and was 
predominantly used in the 2 to <6 years age group. 
The clinical overview states that the results are in line with published data in paediatric patients with 
Ewing sarcoma, in which patients developed febrile neutropaenia after 78% of VIDE cycles with 
pegfilgrastim administration and after 56% cycles with filgrastim. After less myelosuppressive VAI and 
VAC chemotherapy, the incidence of febrile neutropaenia was 0% with pegfilgrastim and 5% with 
filgrastim administration (Wendelin et al 2005). Another group reported febrile neutropaenia in 47% of 
pegfilgrastim-treated paediatric cancer patients after VIDE, 4% after VAC and 33% after VAI (Andre et 
al 2007). The mean duration of febrile neutropaenia after VIDE cycles and stimulation with 
pegfilgrastim was 6.1 days and after stimulation with filgrastim was 5.9 days. After postoperative IVA 
and VAC cycles, the mean duration of severe neutropaenia was 0.4 days after pegfilgrastim and 0.9 
days after filgrastim. Andre et al reported a mean duration of grade 4 neutropaenia of 3 days (range 1 
to 13 days) after pegfilgrastim, similar to the 2.2 day total in the present study with XM22.  
The safety data indicate that a single subcutaneous dose of 100µg/kg of XM22 was generally safe and 
well tolerated for at least 21 days post-administration in the paediatric population. Central ECG 
assessment of the change from baseline QTcF duration did not indicate any QTc liability for XM22. More 
changes were evident when the Bazett’s correction was applied with 2 patients demonstrating a QTcB 
>480 - 500msec 2 days post XM22. No patients had a QTcB >500msec or a change from baseline 
>60msec. Evaluation was complicated by the concomitant administration of medications known to 
prolong the QT interval and further ECG assessment will be required in future studies with a more 
detailed analysis of concomitant medication.  
Page 16/20 
 
 
 
 
 
The upcoming paediatric study XM22-08, will evaluate up to 4 doses of 100µg/kg XM22 treatment in 
comparison to an active control (filgrastim) in the same patient population with type of chemotherapy 
as a stratification variable in the efficacy analysis. The use of prophylactic antibiotics and antipyretics 
will be documented and their effect on the efficacy results analysed. A planned future population PK 
analysis will produce a more definitive analysis of dose with respect to patient demographic factors and 
treatment. 
2.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
The uncontrolled nature of the study limits the conclusions that can be drawn regarding efficacy and 
safety. A single cycle of XM22 was administered, whereas multiple cycles would be given in the typical 
clinical setting. Three different chemotherapy regimens were permissible with varied myelosuppressive 
effects and age-distribution, which complicated the comparison of efficacy across age groups. Key 
efficacy endpoints, namely incidence of febrile neutropaenia and duration of severe neutropaenia, were 
consistent with those reported for pegfilgrastim and filgrastim (which is approved for use in paediatric 
cancer patients) and appeared to be associated with the type of chemotherapy administered rather 
than the age of the patients.  
The primary study objective of measuring PK endpoints was met and the results raised no major 
concerns regarding the PK, efficacy or safety profile of XM22 100µg/kg. The results support continued 
investigation of a 100µg/kg dose of XM22 in the paediatric population, which subsequently will 
evaluate XM22 in comparison to an active control (filgrastim). 
The intention to apply for a variation after completion of the paediatric investigation plan in 2018 is 
fully supported by the rapporteur. A paediatric licence remains the overall aim of the agreed paediatric 
development. An update of the SmPC should be considered when any new paediatric information/ data 
become available. It allows clinicians and prescribers to be informed about ongoing experience with a 
compound in children without promoting off label use or jeopardising the successful completion of the 
agreed paediatric development.  
Recommendation  
A further paediatric study (XM22-08) is planned as part of the paediatric investigation plan and ECG 
assessment should continue in this trial.  
Follow-up data, including the results of immunogenicity testing, survival status and G-CSF therapy is 
awaited and will be provided in a separate addendum report. The MAH is requested to update the 
SmPC for Lonquex to include the paediatric PK data prior to submission of the follow-up study report.

Paediatric population 
The experience in children is limited. Data from to a single dose phase 1 study in 21 
paediatric patients aged 2 to <18 years (see section 5.1) which did not indicate that thea 
difference in safety profile of lipegfilgrastim in children appears to be similarcompared to 
that in adults. Treatment related adverse events were back pain, bone pain and increased 
neutrophil count (1 event each).  
CHMP comment: The EMA proposed deleting the sentence: ‘Treatment related adverse events were 
back pain, bone pain and increased neutrophil count (1 event each)’.  It questioned the rationale for 
selecting these three events, one being the expected pharmacodynamic effect. 
Back pain, bone pain and increased neutrophil count were the three adverse events considered by 
investigators to be related to administration of Lonquex. Increased neutrophil count (leukocytosis) is 
conventionally categorised as an adverse reaction when GCSF therapy causes the neutrophil count to 
become excessively elevated (typically above 50 x109/L). The CHMP proposes that this information is 
retained. 
Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Lonquex in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced 
neutropaenia and prevention of chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropaenia (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). In a phase 1 study (XM22-07) of 21 children aged between 2 
and 16 years of age with Ewing Family of Tumours or rhabdomyosarcoma,  lipegfilgrastim 
was administered as a single subcutaneous dose of 100µg/kg  (up to a maximum of 6mg 
which is the fixed dose for adults) 24 hours after the end of the last chemotherapy 
treatment in week 1 of the regimen. The incidence of febrile neutropaenia varied according 
to age (from 14.3% to 71.4%), with the highest frequency in the oldest age group. The use 
of three different chemotherapy regimens, with varied myelosuppressive effects and age-
distribution, complicated the comparison of efficacy across age groups. See section 4.2.

Paediatric patients 
In a phase 1 study (see section 5.1) XM22-07, using a 10mg/mL solution for subcutaneous 
injection, specifically developed for the paediatric studies, the mean maximum blood 
concentrations (Cmax) were 243 ng/mL in the 2 to <6 years group, 255ng/mL in the 6 to 
<12 years group and 224 ng/mL in the 12 to < 18 years group after a single subcutaneous 
injection of 100µg/kg (maximum 6mg) lipegfilgrastim with the first cycle of chemotherapy. 
The maximum blood concentrations were reached after a median time (tmax) of 23.9 hours, 
30.0 hours and 95.8 hours respectively. See section 4.2.

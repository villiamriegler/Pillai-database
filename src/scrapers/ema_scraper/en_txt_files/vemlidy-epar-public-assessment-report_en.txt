2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Chronic hepatitis B is a major public health care issue worldwide and one of the principal causes of 
chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is 
easily transmissible through perinatal, percutaneous, and sexual exposure. Following acute HBV 
infection, 5% to 10% of adults and up to 90% of children fail to produce an immune response 
adequate to clear the infection; these individuals become chronic carriers of the virus. Individuals who 
develop CHB are at substantial risk of cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and HCC, which will afflict 
15% to 40% of patients with CHB in the absence of effective treatment. Liver cancer is the third 
leading cause of cancer deaths globally, with the highest burden of this disease found in regions where 
HBV is endemic. 
Recent reports estimated that 250 to 350 million individuals are currently living with HBV (i.e. hepatitis 
B surface antigen [HBsAg] positive), representing a worldwide prevalence of 3.6%, with considerable 
geographic variability. For example, HBV prevalence rates of 0.01%, 0.76%, 4.0%, 5.5%, and 22.4% 
have been reported for the United Kingdom, Canada, Turkey, China, and South Sudan, respectively. In 
2013, an estimated 686,000 deaths were due to HBV infection and associated complications, placing it 
among the top 20 causes of mortality worldwide. Despite the availability of HBV vaccine programs in 
many countries, new HBV infections are still common even in areas of low prevalence. The World 
Health Organization estimates that each year there are over 4 million acute clinical cases of HBV 
infection globally. In the United States (US), approximately 20,000 people become acutely infected 
each year according to an estimate from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
2.1.1.  Management 
Currently, there are two approved approaches for the treatment of CHB: injectable interferons and oral 
antiviral (OAV) agents. Compared with OAVs, interferons are administered for a finite treatment 
duration (usually 48 weeks), are not associated with viral resistance, and have shown higher rates of 
antibody against hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) and antibody against hepatitis B e antigen 
(anti-HBe) seroconversion in clinical studies. However, interferons only have modest antiviral efficacy 
and their use is associated with treatment-limiting safety and tolerability issues, including flu-like 
syndrome, fatigue, cytopenias, and mood disturbances. In addition, patient acceptance of interferon 
therapy is low given the requirement for subcutaneous injections and the substantial adverse events 
(AEs) associated with therapy. 
The development of the nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (N[t]RTIs) was a major 
breakthrough for the treatment of CHB, providing effective suppression of viral replication and 
reducing the risk of long-term complications. Currently available OAVs include lamivudine (LAM), 
adefovir dipivoxil (ADV), entecavir (ETV), telbivudine (TBV), and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF; 
Viread). Several N[t]RTIs possess a low barrier for virologic resistance development, including LAM, 
TBV, and ADV, which limit their usefulness for long term treatment of CHB. ETV and TDF are potent 
inhibitors of HBV replication with a higher barrier to resistance, and these OAVs are recommended as 
preferred initial therapies for CHB in all major treatment guidelines. 
Treatment with OAV agents has been successful in achieving and maintaining a high degree of virologic 
suppression, which is associated with decreased morbidity and mortality related to CHB. Along with 
virologic suppression, the majority of patients experience normalization of serum alanine 
Assessment report  
EMA/793580/2016  
Page 10/156 
 
 
 
 
 
aminotransferase (ALT) levels, and with long term OAV treatment, improvement in liver histology is 
observed. As few patients (< 5%) achieve an immunological cure with OAV treatment, defined as 
clearance of HBsAg together with seroconversion to anti-HBs, lifelong therapy is required. 
ETV has a low rate of resistance development in treatment naive patients; however, with long term 
use, the cumulative probability of ETV resistance increases substantially in LAM refractory patients, 
with up to 57% of patients showing reduced susceptibility through 6 years of treatment. ETV is safe 
and well tolerated, but treatment is complicated by the requirement for dose adjustment for patients 
with creatinine clearance (CLcr) < 50 mL/min and, in patients who are refractory to LAM or have LAM 
or TBV resistance, a higher dose is needed.  
TDF, an oral prodrug of tenofovir (TFV), is effective in both treatment naive and treatment experienced 
patients with LAM resistance or prior ADV therapy. After 8 years of TDF treatment for CHB, virologic 
suppression was well maintained and no resistance to TDF has been observed. With 5 years of 
treatment, a histological benefit with regard to regression of fibrosis and reversal of cirrhosis was also 
observed in the majority of treated subjects. However, the use of TDF is associated with a decrement 
in renal function, including, in rare instances, proximal tubulopathy and Fanconi syndrome. TDF 
requires dose adjustment and increased monitoring for patients with renal impairment (patients with 
CLcr < 50 mL/min and those patients with end stage renal disease maintained on haemodialysis), and 
reductions in bone mineral density (BMD) occur with TDF treatment in both HBV  and HIV infected 
patients. The bone and renal toxicities associated with TDF necessitate caution when treating 
individuals at greatest risk, including patients with pre-existing renal impairment, patients with 
comorbidities that increase the risk for renal dysfunction (e.g. those with hypertension and/or diabetes 
mellitus), and the elderly, who are also at increased risk for comorbidities, especially those related to 
kidney and bone. 
About the product 
Tenofovir (TFV) is a nucleotide analogue with limited oral bioavailability. Tenofovir disoproxil (marketed 
as the fumarate TDF), an oral pro-drug of TFV, has improved bioavailability vs. TFV. While TDF is used 
broadly in the treatment of HIV-1 and HBV infection, an important identified risk with its use is 
nephrotoxicity. This may result in increased serum creatinine, increased urinary protein loss 
(particularly tubular) and occasional cases of proximal renal tubulopathy (PRT) including Fanconi 
syndrome. These risks necessitate increased renal monitoring of patients during treatment with TDF-
containing products vs. other therapies, placing burden on the patient and healthcare provider. 
Reductions in bone mineral density (BMD) also occur, with larger decreases in BMD observed with TDF 
than with other treatments.  
Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is another oral pro-drug of TFV. TAF is more stable in plasma than TDF, 
provides higher intracellular levels of the active phosphorylated metabolite tenofovir diphosphate (TFV 
DP), and approximately 90% lower circulating levels of TFV relative to TDF. TAF is proposed to provide 
similar efficacy as TDF but with significantly less proteinuria, less need for renal monitoring and less 
impact on bone mineralisation.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets containing 25 mg of tenofovir alafenamide (as 
fumarate) as active substance. 
Other ingredients are:  
Tablet core: lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose (E460(i)), croscarmellose sodium (E468) 
and magnesium stearate (E470b). 
Film-coating: polyvinyl alcohol (E1203), titanium dioxide (E171), macrogol (E1521), talc (E553b) and 
iron oxide yellow (E172). 
The product is available in high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles enclosed with a polypropylene 
continuous-thread, child-resistant cap and an induction-activated aluminium foil liner. Each bottle 
contains silica gel desiccant and a polyester coil as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The active substance is identical to that used in other approved products from the same applicant 
(Genvoya, Odefsey and Descovy) and a declaration was received stating that the contents of module 3 
are identical. 
The chemical name of tenofovir alafenamide fumarate is propan-2-yl N-[(S)-({[(2R)-1-(6-amino-9H-
purin-9-yl)propan-2-yl]-oxy}methyl)(phenoxy)phosphoryl]-L-alaninate, (2E)-but-2-enedioate (2:1) 
and it has the following structure: 
Figure 1.  Structure of tenofovir alafenamide fumarate 
The chemical structure of tenofovir alafenamide fumarate has been adequately demonstrated by 
infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H, 13C, and 31P), mass 
spectrometry, elemental analysis, ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy, and X-ray crystallography. 
The active substance is a white to off-white or tan, slightly hygroscopic powder. Tenofovir alafenamide 
fumarate is a BCS Class III compound, with pH-dependent aqueous solubility decreasing with 
increasing basicity. It is soluble at low pH (pH 2.0), sparingly soluble at pH 3.8, and slightly soluble at 
pH values up to 8.0. Tenofovir alafenamide fumarate is freely soluble in methanol, soluble in ethanol, 
sparingly soluble in isopropanol and slightly soluble in acetone. 
Assessment report  
EMA/793580/2016  
Page 12/156 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tenofovir alafenamide exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of three chiral centres. The chiral 
centre at the propyloxy- side chain is in the R-configuration. The absolute stereoconfiguration of the 
carbonylethylamino- substituent is derived from the amino acid L-alanine, which has the S-
configuration at the alpha-carbon. The remaining stereocentre is located at the phosphorus atom and 
is in the S- configuration. Enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely by chiral HPLC at the point of the 
introduction of the chiral starting material and in a manufacturing process intermediate. 
Polymorphism has been observed for tenofovir alafenamide fumarate. A single polymorphic form is 
consistently generated through the manufacturing process and this form has been adequately 
characterised. 
The applicant has provided justification for TAF to be considered as a new active substance (NAS) on 
the basis of its unique chemical structure. However, both TAF and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), 
which is a known active substance, are prodrugs being metabolised to the same major active 
metabolite tenofovir (TFV) in vivo. Therefore, both active substances share the same therapeutic 
moiety and as such, TAF is not considered a NAS on quality grounds. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Tenofovir alafenamide fumarate is obtained from two manufacturers using the same synthetic route. 
The active substance is synthesized in multiple steps. During the evaluation procedure, the active 
substance starting materials were re-defined to ensure enough of the process is documented in the 
dossier in line with ICH Q11. Commercially available well-defined starting materials with acceptable 
specifications are used. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. Potential and actual 
impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
Critical process parameters were identified using a risk assessment approach. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the 
clinical development program. Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and have 
been justified. The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is 
considered to be comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process. 
The active substance is packaged in double-lined polyethylene bags which comply with the EC directive 
2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. The bags are held in high-density polyethylene drums (or 
other suitable secondary container) with lids of appropriate size and fitted with a security seal. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances.  
Specification 
The active substance specification reproduced below includes tests for appearance (visual 
examination), identity (IR, HPLC), identity of fumaric acid (HPLC), clarity of solution (visual 
examination), water content (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC, HPLC-MS, GC), residual 
solvents (GC), elemental impurities (ICP MS), and melting point (Ph. Eur.). 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
Assessment report  
EMA/793580/2016

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standard used for assay testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data (n=16 using the proposed commercial process; 13 of which were commercial scale 
and 3 pilot scale) of the active substance, manufactured at both proposed manufacturing sites are 
provided. Additional batch analysis data for development batches used in pre-clinical pharmacokinetics 
and toxicological studies are provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from 
batch to batch. 
The active substance specifications are based on the active substance critical quality attributes (CQA). 
Stability 
Stability data on 6 commercial scale batches of active substance from the both proposed 
manufacturers stored in the intended commercial package for up to 36 months under long term 
conditions at 5 ºC and for up to 24 months under accelerated conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH according 
to the ICH guidelines were provided. Results under stressed conditions for up to 6 months at 40 ºC / 
75% RH on 5 batches were provided. Additionally, results for 4 days at 60 ºC / ambient RH; for 4 days 
at 50 ºC / ambient RH; and for 4 days at -20 ºC were also provided on one batch. 
The parameters tested are the same as for release. The analytical methods used were the same as for 
release and were stability indicating. 
Degradation products increased under accelerated conditions but remained within the specification. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch, indication that the 
active substance is not photosensitive. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the both proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed re-test period at the recommended long-
term storage condition in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Vemlidy is presented as round yellow film-coated tablets debossed with “GSI” on one face and “25” on 
the other. 
Development work aimed to produce an immediate release tablet with suitable properties for clinical 
use and taking into account the properties of the active substance. Tenofovir alafenamide fumarate is 
a BCS class 3 compound with high solubility across the physiological pH range. It exhibits pH-
dependent solubility in aqueous solution, being most stable at pH 6 and susceptible to hydrolysis at 
more acidic and basic pH. 
During early development, the impact of filler and disintegrant type and content on product 
performance was evaluated by manufacturing film-coated tablets with nine different compositions with 
different amounts of excipients. The best of these was used in phase 1 clinical trials. This formulation 
was used as the basis for tablets for phase 3 studies, although the film-coat was changed and 
debossing added. This formulation was also selected for commercialisation.

All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The dissolution method for release and stability testing was developed in line with ICH Q6A and EMA 
guidelines. Parameters such as pH, volume, buffer concentration, apparatus type and agitation speed 
were optimised in order to ensure complete dissolution whilst maintaining discriminatory power with 
regards to meaningful changes in tablet composition and attributes. 
The commercial manufacturing process evolved in concert with the clinical development program. The 
impact of each step of the process on potential critical quality attributes of the finished product was 
evaluated by risk assessment based on prior knowledge of the physicochemical properties of the active 
substance and the manufacturing method. Parameters for unit operations in each step of the process 
(pre-blending, granulation, blending, compression and film-coating) were investigated, guided by the 
outcome of the risk assessment (summarised below), using a series of multivariate experiments. 
Critical process parameters (CPPs) were identified and set-points for each unit operation, along with 
proven acceptable ranges (PARs) were defined. However, no design space is claimed and only one 
factor at a time will be moved from its set-point. The data presented fully supports the proposed PARs. 
Based the process understanding gained during development work, finished product attributes were 
defined as critical and the control strategy elaborated accordingly. 
The primary packaging is an HDPE bottle enclosed with a polypropylene continuous-thread, child-
resistant cap and an induction-activated aluminium foil liner. Each bottle contains silica gel desiccant 
and a polyester coil. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the 
container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of 
the product. The silica gel desiccant has been shown to provide adequate protection from moisture. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of six main steps: blending of tenofovir alafenamide fumarate with 
intra-granular excipients, dry granulation followed by milling, blending with extra-granular excipients, 
compression,  film-coating  and  packaging.  The  process  is  considered  to  be  a  standard  manufacturing 
process. 
Holding  times  have  been  defined  for  final  powder  blend,  tablet  cores,  and  bulk  film-coated  tablets 
based on stability studies and are considered acceptable when shelf-life is defined in line with the Note 
for Guidance on start of shelf-life of the finished dosage form (CPMP/QWP/072/96). Major steps of the 
manufacturing  process  will  be  validated  prior  to  commercialisation.  A  detailed  validation  protocol  has 
been provided and is considered acceptable. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process 
is  capable  of  producing  the  finished  product  of  intended  quality  in  a  reproducible  manner.  The  in-
process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form 
including  appearance,  identification  (HPLC,  UV),  water  content  (Ph.  Eur.),  assay  (HPLC),  impurities 
(HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (HPLC), and microbiological examination (Ph. 
Eur.).

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results were provided for eight production scale batches confirming the consistency of 
the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from four production scale batches of finished product manufactured at the commercial 
site and stored for up to 24 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH), up to 24 months 
under intermediate conditions (30 ºC / 65% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions 
(40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are 
identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for 
marketing. Samples were tested for appearance, water content, assay, impurities, dissolution, and 
microbiological quality. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
There were no significant changes to any of the measured parameters under long term conditions 
except for a small increase in degradation products and a decrease in water content due to the 
desiccant. All parameters remained within specification limits. Under intermediate conditions, more 
degradation was observed, along with a decrease in assay although levels remained within 
specification. Water content also decreased. The other parameters remained unchanged. Under 
accelerated conditions, significant degradation was observed after 6 months coupled with a decrease in 
assay but remained within specification limits. Apart from a decrease in water content, the other 
parameters remained unchanged. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. No significant changes to any of the measured parameters were 
observed indicating that the finished product is not photosensitive. 
Stress studies were carried out at -20 oC (6 months), 50 oC (7 days), 60 oC (7 days) and in an open 
dish under long term and intermediate conditions (4 weeks). No significant changes to any of the 
measured parameters were observed at -20 oC or 50 oC. At 60 oC, a decrease in assay and increase in 
degradation was observed. In increase in water content was observed in the open dish studies, more 
so at higher humidity and an increase in degradation was noted at higher temperature and humidity. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months when stored in the original 
package to protect from moisture as stated in the SmPC (sections 6.3 and 6.4) is acceptable.

2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is a prodrug of tenofovir (TFV), and after absorption TAF is converted to 
TFV intracellularly, which is phosphorylated to the active metabolite, tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP), 
that competes with natural 2’-deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) for incorporation by the HIV-1 or 
HBV reverse transcriptase (RT) and, once incorporated, results in chain-termination. TAF differs from 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) as it is more stable in human plasma than TDF despite rapidly 
undergoing intracellular conversion to TFV. Treatment with TAF results in higher levels of TFV-DP in 
PBMCs and 90% lower circulating levels of TFV relative to TDF 
Tenofovir alafenamide is approved as part of a fixed dose combination called Genvoya (elvitegravir / 
cobicistat / emtricitabine / tenofovir alafenamide EMEA/H/C/004042/0000). On 25 February 2016, the 
Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion, recommending 
the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Descovy (emtricitabine and 
tenofovir alafenamide.  
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is part of the approved FDC products Truvada (Emtricitabine (FTC)/ 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)), Atripla (efavirenz (EFV)/FTC/TDF), Eviplera (FTC/ rilpivirine 
(RPV)/TDF) and Stribild (EVG/ cobicistat (COBI)/FTC/TDF) for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. 
TFV is currently available in marketed form of Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), marketed by Gilead 
Sciences under the trade name Viread.  
TAF has been identified as a next generation oral prodrug of TFV as it may improve distribution of the 
active substance into peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs) and to lymphatic organs following 
Assessment report

oral administration.  TAF could deliver more intracellular tenofovir to PMBCs and lead to lower levels of 
circulating this active substance resulting in improved safety. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
After absorption, TAF is converted intracellularly to TFV, which is phosphorylated to the active 
metabolite, TFV-DP, that competes with natural 2’-deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) for 
incorporation by the HBV DNA pol/RT or HIV-1 RT and, once incorporated, results in chain-termination. 
Tenofovir diphosphate is a very weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerases α, ß, δ, ε, and 
mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ. 
As TAF is more stable in plasma than TDF, higher intracellular levels are achieved, providing enhanced 
delivery of TFV and 90% lower circulating levels of TFV relative to TDF. These features translate into 
less risk of nephrotoxicity and less decrease (or improvements) in bone mineral density, both of which 
are identified risks with TDF administration.

After TAF penetrates cells, the prodrug carboxylester bond is cleaved by a hydrolase (ie, CES1, CatA, 
etc.), releasing an intermediate metabolite TFV-alanine (TFV-Ala), which is then hydrolyzed to parent 
TFV and sequentially phosphorylated by adenylate kinase and nucleoside diphosphate kinase to form 
the active metabolite TFV-DP.

CatA = cathepsin A; CES1 = carboxylesterase 1; NDP = nucleoside diphosphate; RT = reverse transcriptase; TAF = tenofovir alafenamide; TFV = 
tenofovir 
The intracellular metabolism of TAF was investigated in PBMCs and macrophages. The ester bond of 
TAF is known to be cleaved by lysosomal CatA. TAF hydrolase activity was assessed in cell extracts in 
the presence or absence of known CatA inhibitors (telaprevir and boceprevir), a CES1 inhibitor (bis-p-
nitrophenyl phosphate, BNPP), a CYP3A4 and Pgp inhibitor (cobicistat), or a combination of telaprevir 
and BNPP together. BNPP inhibited metabolism of 0.5 μM TAF in a dose dependent manner with 
approximately 37, 30, or 66% inhibition observed at 2, 10, or 50 μM BNPP, respectively. At 
concentrations of 10 μM and 50 μM of each inhibitor, inhibition of TFV-DP formation of approximately 
84 and 95% inhibition, respectively, was observed. These results suggest that CES1 is the 
predominant enzyme activating TAF in primary human hepatocytes and that CatA also makes a minor 
contribution.  
Due to the enzymatic role in TAF metabolism, differences in CES1 and/or CatA cellular levels may 
affect the antiviral activity of TAF. The expression levels of CES1 and CatA and their contribution to 
intracellular metabolism of TAF were assessed in two hepatic cell lines commonly used for antiviral 
assays (HepG2 and HepAD38). The expression level of CES1 in both hepatic cell extracts was 17- to 
43-fold less than in pooled human liver S9 fractions. In comparison, the expression of CatA in 
bothhepatic cell extracts was 2.4- to 4.8-fold greater than in pooled human liver S9 fractions. A 
possible explanation for this difference is that suppression of CES1 expression levels may be common 
in hepatic cell lines. 
Hydrolytic activation of TAF in extracts of HepG2 and HepAD38 cells was also evaluated in the 
presence or absence of inhibitors of CES1 (BNPP) and/or CatA (telaprevir). BNPP showed no impact on 
TAF hydrolysis in either HepG2 or HepAD38 cells up to the highest concentration tested (50 μM). In 
contrast, telaprevir was a potent inhibitor of TAF hydrolysis to TFV-Ala in both HepG2 and HepAD38 
cells with similar IC50 values of 0.2 and 0.1 μM, respectively. Following incubation of HepAD38 cells 
with 0.5 µM of TAF, telaprevir significantly inhibited metabolism of TAF to TFV-DP by 2.2-fold, whereas 
the effect of BNPP was negligible (1.2-fold). When both telaprevir and BNPP were combined, a 3.7-fold 
greater inhibition of TFV-DP formation was observed, relative to telaprevir alone. 
Assessment report  
EMA/793580/2016  
Page 19/156 
 
 
 
 
 
 
These results indicate that CatA is the major hydrolyzing enzyme of TAF in hepatic cell lines, while 
CES1 has a modest contribution. 
TAF activation in the presence of protease inhibitors 
Since certain viral protease inhibitors (PIs) have been shown to be potent inhibitors of CatA, the 
potential for drug-drug interactions between TAF and antiviral PIs were evaluated in a hydrolase 
activity assay using purified CatA. The HIV PIs darunavir, atazanavir, lopinavir, and ritonavir, as well 
as the boosting agent cobicistat did not inhibit CatA-mediated hydrolysis of TAF up to a concentration 
of 50 μM, well above the clinical Cmax of each drug. In contrast, the covalent anti-HCV PIs telaprevir 
and boceprevir were identified as potent inhibitors of CatA-mediated hydrolysis of TAF, with IC50 
values of 0.3 and 0.2 μM, respectively. When adjusted for plasma binding, these IC50 values are 6- to 
8-fold below the clinical maximum concentration (Cmax) levels observed in patients. 
Overall, all tested HIV PIs and the majority of tested HCV PIs exhibited minimal potential to interfere 
with the intracellular activation of TAF. These data support the co-administration of these therapeutic 
PIs in coinfected patients, with the exception of telaprevir and boceprevir, in combination with TAF, 
without negatively affecting its intracellular conversion to TFV (see Table 7).

TAF (and TFV) loading in the Rhesus monkey 
The plasma pharmacokinetic profile of TAF (and TFV) and intracellular TAF metabolism in PBMCs were 
examined in non-human primates (NHP) given a single oral dose of tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) 
monofumarate at 5.0 or 50 mg/kg (study number: P2000087). At 50 mg/kg, TAF and TFV levels in the 
plasma increased rapidly with Tmax values of 0.5 and 1 hour, respectively. In these same animals, TAF 
and TFV levels in the plasma decreased with t1/2 values of 0.40 and 17.33 hours, respectively. In 
PBMCs, TFV levels persisted up to 96 hours with an apparently slower decline than in plasma. The TFV 
levels were significantly higher in the samples treated with acid phosphatase, suggesting that a 
significant proportion of TFV-related material in PBMCs was in phosphorylated forms. In another NHP 
study (study number: P2001025) in which animals were given a single subcutaneous dose of [14C]TFV 
at 15, 30, or 60 mg/kg, TFV was efficiently taken up by PBMCs and metabolised to TFV-DP, with the 
intracellular concentrations of the active metabolite TFV-DP reaching 0.9 µM (30-mg/kg dose group). 
The t1/2 of TFV-DP in PBMCs was > 50 hours. Significant levels of TFV and its metabolites were also 
observed in LMNCs from axillary, inguinal, and mesenteric lymph node sites 48 hours after dosing. 
Inhibition of HBV (and HIV-1) Reverse Transcriptase 
HBV is a member of the Hepadnaviridae family, while HIV-1 is a member of the Retroviridae family. 
Both HBV and HIV-1 replicate by reverse transcription requiring RNA-dependent DNA polymerase 
(RDDP), DNA-dependent DNA polymerase (DDDP), and ribonuclease H activities. Both HBV and HIV-1 
encode a RT enzyme with conserved homology. HBV RT has been interchangeably designated as 
polymerase, RT, or polymerase/reverse transctipaste (pol/RT), since it contains an additional N-
terminal protein domain and spacer domain; the former of which is involved in protein-priming of viral 
DNA synthesis. The effect of TFV-DP on the DDDP activity of HBV pol/RT was evaluated in an 
enzymatic assay using recombinant HBV pol/RT expressed and purified from baculovirus. Polymerase 
activity of HBV pol/RT was inhibited by TFV-DP in a dose-dependent manner without a change in 
maximal upstroke velocity (Vmax). The kinetic inhibition constant (Ki) of DDDP inhibition by TFV-DP 
was determined to be 0.18 μM, which is 2.1-fold lower than the Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) of 
dATP. 
These results showed that TFV-DP inhibits HBV pol/RT and HIV-1 RT by binding competition with dATP 
into DNA, which caused premature termination of DNA synthesis upon its incorporation into the 
nascent DNA chain. 
In Vitro evaluation of anti-HBV activity 
The antiviral activity of TAF was assessed in HepG2 cells against a panel of 11 wild-type clinical HBV 
isolates representing genotypes A to H (study number PC-320-2003). Full-length genomes or pol/RT 
regions were amplified from treatment-naive patients infected with genotypes A to H cloned into 
expression vectors, and transfected into HepG2 cells. After 7 days of treatment in the presence of TAF, 
HBV DNA intermediates were extracted and quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
for determination of in vitro susceptibility. TAF showed antiviral activity against all HBV genotypes 
evaluated. The concentration inhibiting viral replication by 50% (EC50) values for the 11 isolates 
ranged from 34.7 to 134.4 nM, with an overall mean EC50 of 86.6 nM. Although genotypes D and H 
showed slight hypersensitivity to TAF, all other genotypes had similar TAF EC50 values compared with 
the control laboratory strain, pHY92 (see Table 8).

Anti-HBV activity and cytotoxicity of TAF 
TAF was evaluated in vitro for antiviral activity against HBV (EC50) and cytotoxicity (concentration that 
results in 50% cytotoxicity [CC50]) in HepG2 cells (study numbers: PC-320-2003 & PC-120-2007). TAF 
exhibited antiviral activity against all tested HBV genotypes (A to H), with an overall mean EC50 of 
86.6 nM. In addition, TAF had no observed cellular cytotoxicity up to the highest tested concentration 
(44400 nM). Based on these results, the selectivity (therapeutic) index (SI) for TAF was > 513 in 
HepG2 cells. 
Drug-resistant variants 
To evaluate the antiviral activity of TAF against HBV containing NRTI-R mutation(s), a panel of 11 drug 
resistant mutants was created in a full-length HBV clinical isolate by site-directed mutagenesis (study 
number: PC-320-2007). Constructs containing ADV-R (n = 5), LAM-R (n = 3), and/or ETV-R (n = 3) 
mutations were transfected into HepG2 cells and treated with TAF for 7 days in order to determine in 
vitro susceptibility. Overall, TAF showed anti-HBV activity against all LAM-R (3 of 3) and ETV-R (3 of 3) 
recombinants and most ADV-R (4 of 5) recombinants, with mean change in EC50 values of < 2.0-fold 
compared with wild type. One ADV-R recombinant (rtA181V + rtN236T), exhibited a low-level (3.7-
fold) reduced susceptibility to TAF compared with wild type. In terms of fold change compared with the 
wild-type isolate, susceptibility to TAF for this panel of recombinants was nearly identical to TFV with 
minor variability. As expected, all LAM-R and ETV-R recombinants exhibited significantly reduced 
susceptibility to LAM (> 48.8-fold) and ETV (> 28.6-fold), respectively.

In vivo 
The woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) in its natural host, the eastern woodchuck Marmata monax is 
often used as a model of HBV infection. The antiviral effect of oral administration of TDF against 
chronic WHV infection was evaluated in a short-term (4-week) placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study. 
Animals were given oral doses of TDF at 0.5, 1.5, and 5.0 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks. A significant 
reduced serum viral load, resulting in 0.2 (p < 0.01), 1.1 (p < 0.01), and 1.5 log10 (p < 0.05) 
decreases, respectively, from the pre-treatment levels, was seen. A dose of 15 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks 
reduced serum viral load by 1.2 log10 but was not considered statistically significant due to the degree 
of individual variation in the antiviral response. 
In another long-term (48-week) study, the antiviral efficacy of oral administration of TDF, adefovir 
dipivoxil (ADV), LAM (lamivudine), and emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir alafenamide (coformulated) 
(FTC) as well as the combinations of TDF or ADV with LAM and FTC at 15 mg/kg/day were evaluated in 
chronic woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV)infected woodchucks (Study number PC-174-2004). At 12 
weeks of treatment, the TDF-containing groups of TDF alone, LAM+TDF, and FTC+TDF had mean 
serum viral load reductions of 3.6, 3.7 and 4.2 log10 copies/mL, respectively. Between Weeks 12 and 
24, varying degrees of viral rebound were observed across all drug treatment groups. At Week 48, the 
treatment groups of TDF alone, LAM+TDF, and FTC+TDF had mean serum viral load reductions of 2.9, 
5.8, and 6.1 log10 copies/mL, respectively. In the entire 48-week dosing period, there was no 
evidence of toxicity in woodchucks treated with any of the drugs or drug combinations. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
TAF is hydrolyzed to TFV in target cells resulting in high intracellular levels of TFV-DP in vivo. The in 
vitro specificity of TFV-DP for mammalian DNA polymerases, relative to its interaction with viral 
polymerases, was determined. TFV-DP was shown to be a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA 
polymerases α, β, δ, ε, and mtDNA polymerase γ.  
A primary screen was used to determine the effect of the prodrug TDF and the parent drug TFV (the 
major metabolite of TDF and TAF) on the inhibition or stimulation of binding in a series of 111 protein 
targets (neuroreceptors, ion channels, transporters, and nuclear receptors (Study number: 
V2000020)). The protein target was incubated in the presence of 10 μM TFV or TDF. The effect on the 
binding of the endogenous ligand was then determined. Responses of > 50% stimulation or inhibition 
were considered significant. There was no significant inhibition or stimulation of ligand binding to its 
protein target by either TFV or TDF. The results of this study demonstrate that neither TFV nor TDF 
significantly interact with any of the 111 protein targets tested. 
The cytotoxicity profiles (CC50 values) of TAF, its stereoisomer GS-7339, TDF, and TFV were 
investigated in resting and dividing human PBMCs following 5 days of continuous drug incubation 
(Study No. PC-120-2009, non-GLP).  The maximum concentrations of drugs used were 100, 100, 50, 
and 2000 μM, for TAF, GS-7339, TDF, and TFV, respectively.  TAF doses used in this in vitro study 
were supra-therapeutic in concentration and duration. CC50 values for TAF ranged from 6.8 μM in 
dividing PBMCs to 25.1 μM in resting PBMCs.  TAF showed low cytotoxicity in resting and in dividing 
PBMCs. 
The cytotoxicity profiles (CC50 values) of TAF, TDF, TFV, and a panel of clinically relevant antiretroviral 
inhibitors were also evaluated in 2 T-lymphoblastoid cell lines (MT-2 and MT-4) following 5 days of 
exposure (Study No. PC-120-2007, non-GLP), TAF showed low cytotoxicity in T-lymphoblastoid cells 
providing ≥ 1997-fold increased selectivity relative to antiviral activity in T-lymphoblastoid cell lines. 
Similarly TAF demonstrated low cytotoxicity to hepatic cells.

Tenofovir alafenamide also showed little to no effect on erythroid and myeloid progenitor proliferation 
in vitro (Study No. PC-120-2016, non-GLP). 
The cytotoxicity of TAF and TFV was assessed in human HEK293T cells transiently expressing OAT1 
and OAT3 (Study No. PC-120-2018, non-GLP).  Cells were incubated with serial dilutions of TFV or TAF 
for 4 days.  TAF did not interact with the renal organic anion transporters 1 or 3 (OAT1 or OAT3), and 
TAF exhibited no OAT-dependent cytotoxicity in human epithelial kidney cells transiently expressing 
these transporters.  In addition, the selectivity index (considering CC50 in renal HEK293 cells 
expressing OAT1 or OAT3 relative to EC50 in primary CD4+ T lymphocytes) for TAF (29,000 and 4270, 
respectively) was much higher than for TFV (14 and 82, respectively).  As a result TAF is unlikely to 
accumulate in renal proximal tubules in an OAT-dependent manner, supporting the hypothesis that it 
has the potential for an improved renal safety profile.  
When primary osteoblasts and PBMCs were treated with TAF doses consistent with human therapeutic 
exposure, comparable TFV-DP levels were achieved (Study No. PC-120-2008).  At these therapeutically 
relevant doses of TAF, there were no in vitro effects on cell viability with primary osteoblasts or PBMCs. 
The impact of TAF on mitochondrial toxicity was assessed. Previous studies have demonstrated a 
minimal effect of TFV on the mitochondrial DNA synthesis in vitro.  The potential for TAF to induce 
mitochondrial DNA depletion was evaluated in HepG2 cells (Study No. PC-120-2006, non-GLP). HepG2 
cells treated with TAF (0.1, 0.3, or 1.0 μM) for 10 days exhibited no significant reduction in 
mitochondrial DNA compared with untreated cells.   No effect of TFV was seen on the synthesis of 
mitochondrial DNA or lactic acid production in HepG2 human liver cells or in normal human skeletal 
muscle cells (SkMCs) (Study No. P1278-00042, non-GLP).  The results confirm the low potential for 
TFV to interfere with mitochondrial functions.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
In vivo safety pharmacology experiments were conducted using TAF as the monofumarate form (GS-
7340-02) in 50 mM citric acid.   
Cardiovascular system: 
In the in vitro hERG assay, TAF as GS-7340-03 was dissolved in DMSO and diluted with HEPES-
buffered physiological saline to a final concentration of 0.3% DMSO. 
TAF (as GS-7340-03) was evaluated at concentrations of 1 and 10 μM (free base equivalents [fbe]), 
and hERG inhibition was not significant.  The IC50 for the inhibitory effect of TAF on hERG was 
estimated to be greater than 10 μM (Study No. PC-120-2005, GLP).  
Oral administration of TAF (as GS-7340-02) to conscious instrumented male beagle dogs at doses of 
30 or 100 mg/kg (24 and 80 mg fbe/kg) did not induce pharmacologic effects on heart rate, systemic 
blood pressure, or ECGs (Study No. D2000006, GLP). 
Central Nervous System: 
The effect of TAF on the central nervous system has been examined in GLP Study No. R990188 using 
male SD rats.  Animals were treated with single oral doses of TAF (as the monofumarate form) with 
doses of 0, 100 or 1000 mg/kg (80 or 800 mg free base equivalents [fbe]/kg).  There was no evidence 
of any effect on the CNS at any dose tested up to 1000 mg/kg.

Gastrointestinal: 
SD rats were administered TAF (as GS-7340-02) by oral gavage at doses of 0, 100 or 1000 mg/kg (0, 
80 or 800 mg fbe/kg).  At the highest dose the rate of gastric emptying was reduced, although this 
was not observed at 100 mg/kg (80 mg fbe/kg).  A dose of 100 mg/kg was considered to have had no 
effect on gastric emptying or intestinal motility. (Study No. R990187, GLP). 
Renal:  
The effect of TAF (as GS-7340-02) on the renal system was evaluated in male SD rats following 
administration of single oral doses of 0, 100, or 1000 mg/kg (80 or 800 mg free base equivalents 
[fbe]/kg) (Study No. R990186, GLP).  Urinary output of calcium was increased at 1000 mg/kg, 
however this was correlated with an increase in serum calcium concentration and indicated that the 
kidneys were functioning well in order to reduce the serum calcium load.  The no-effect dose for a 
pharmacological effect on the renal system was 1000 mg/kg. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of TFV/TAF were evaluated in vitro and in a 
variety of animal models in vivo.  In addition, the drug-drug interaction profile was also evaluated.  
Methods of analysis 
The in vivo pharmacokinetic, toxicokinetics, distribution, and excretion of TAF were assessed in mouse, 
rat, dog, and monkey.  The in vitro absorption, metabolism, and drug interaction characteristics of TAF 
were studied in appropriate model systems.  Levels of TAF and TFV in rats and dog plasma and PBMCs 
were determined using fluorescence derivitization/HPLC.  Additional methods to detect levels of TAF 
and TFV in mouse, rat, rabbit and dog plasma/PMBCs included validated LC/MS/MS methods, and HPLC 
detection methods.  The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of TAF were assessed in 
various species following a single oral administration of [14C]TAF, and levels of TAF and its metabolites 
were measured using LSC, HPLC or LC/MS/MS coupled with flow-through detector (RFD).  In vitro 
determination of TAF levels were in the main determined by LC/MS/MS, with some LC-radio-profiling.  
Induction potential of TAF on CYP activity measured mRNA levels using qRT PCR methods. 
Absorption 
In vitro: Permeability of TAF was examined using Caco-2 cells (Study No. AD-120-2037). TAF was 
applied to monolayers of these cells at 10, 100, and 1000 µM, and TAF showed a dose dependent 
increase in forward permeability and a decrease in efflux ratio indicating saturable efflux transport.  
Addition of the efflux transport inhibitor, cyclosporine A (CsA) diminished the efflux ratio and increased 
the permeability.  
Mouse: Both single and repeat dose studies were completed in mice.  
In the single dose pharmacokinetic study in mice, TAF/TFV were evaluated following administration of 
TAF by dosing either tenofovir alafenamide monofumarate (GS-7340-02) or tenofovir alafenamide 
hemifumarate (GS-7340-03) to male CD-1 mice or GS-7340-03 (hemifumarate) to both male and 
female 001178-W mice via oral gavage (Study Nos. AD-120-2014 and AD-120-2016).

Tenofovir exposure increased with the increase in dose and was greater than dose proportional 
between 10 to 100 mg/kg. Gender differences in plasma TFV levels were less than 2-fold in Cmax and 
AUC0-t values. The pharmacokinetic profiles for the 2 different fumarate forms of TAF were observed 
to be generally similar. 
Tenofovir alafenamide monofumarate was administered by oral gavage for up to 14 days to male and 
female mice at a dose of 100, 500, or 1000 mg/kg/day (Study No. TX-120-2006).  Due to early death 
for animals given 500 or 1000 mg/kg/day, only the 100 mg/kg/day dose group was evaluated.  GS-
7340 at 100 mg/kg/day corresponded to a Day 14 Cmax of 27.1 and 2.89 ng/mL for males and 
females, respectively; the AUC0-24 could not be calculated due to the lack of a distinct elimination 
phase. GS-7340 rapidly converted to its metabolite, TFV.  There were no significant differences in TFV 
pharmacokinetic profiles between males and females. 
Following daily administration of Tenofovir alafenamide monofumarate to mice via oral gavage for at 
least 13 weeks at doses of 0, 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day, the pharmacokinetic parameters for TAF and 
TFV were determined (Study No. TX-120-2007).  Exposure to TFV increased with the increase in GS-
7340-02 dose from 10 to 100 mg/kg/day.  The increases in Cmax and AUC0-t were generally greater 
than proportional between the 10 to 100 mg/kg/day dose levels.  Gender-based differences were less 
than 2-fold in TFV Cmax and AUC0-t values.  There was no sign of accumulation of TFV after multiple 
dosing, and there is rapid and extensive conversion of TAF to TFV after oral administration in mice. 
Rat: Both single and repeat dose studies were completed in rats.  
In the single dose pharmacokinetic study in rats, the two forms of TAF (monofumarate and 
hemifumarate) were again compared, as was the exposure to TFV between TAF and TDF (Study Nos. 
R990130, AD-120-2015, and R2000065).  TAF was rapidly absorbed and generation of the major 
metabolite TFV was observed with a Tmax of less than 1 hour.  TFV exposure increased in a greater 
than dose proportional manner.  There no significant difference in pharmacokinetic parameters 
between the two forms of TAF.  
In a comparison between exposure of TFV generated due to TAF or TDF (Study No. R20000065), rats 
were treated orally with a single dose of 400 mg/kg of TAF (GS-7340-02) or TDF.  The plasma Cmax 
and AUC for TFV were 2- to 3-fold higher with 400 mg/kg TAF compared to 400 mg/kg TDF. 
The plasma pharmacokinetic profile of tenofovir alafenamide monofumarate was determined during the 
course of a 28 day oral gavage toxicity study in adult male and female albino rats following daily 
administration of either 1.5, 6.25, 25, 100 or 400 mg/kg/day GS-7340-02 (Study No. R990182).  A 
greater than dose proportional increase in exposure was observed.  There was no evidence of 
accumulation.  
In a 26-week toxicology study, tenofovir alafenamide monofumarate was administered once daily at 
doses of 0 (vehicle only), 5, 25 and 100 mg/kg/day by oral gavage and plasma pharmacokinetic 
parameters of TFV were determined on Day 1 and during Weeks 13 and 26 (Study No. TOX-120-001).  
No consistent differences in plasma pharmacokinetic parameters were found between male and female 
rats.  Mean tenofovir Cmax and AUC values increased dose proportionally over the dose range of 5 to 
100 mg/kg/day.  Mean TFV AUC obtained on Day 1 was slightly lower than that measured during 
Weeks 13 and 26, which suggested that there was a slight accumulation of tenofovir with repeat 
dosing. 
Dog: Both single and repeat dose studies were completed in dogs.   
In Study No. 99-DDM-1278-001-PK the effect on pharmacokinetic parameters due to changes in the 
stereo configuration, fumarate form, food, and the route of administration was examined.  In this

study Beagle dogs were administered TAF as a single IV bolus (tenofovir alafenamide monofumarate 
[6.3 mg/kg]), or oral administration (TAF as free base [18.0 mg/kg], its diastereomer GS-7339 [18.0 
mg/kg], the mixture GS-7171 [16.0 mg/kg], or GS-7340-02 [4,8, 5.0, and 20 mg/kg under fasted and 
5.0 mg/kg under fed conditions]).  Following oral administration, TAF and its diasteroisomer were 
rapidly absorbed and eliminated with a tmax of less than 0.5 h and t½ ranging from 0.2-0.9 h.  The 
plasma exposures to the intact prodrugs were similar when TAF or GS-7339 were dosed separately, 
however, when the isomeric mixture, GS-7171, was dosed, the exposure to GS-7339 was 
approximately 3-fold higher than TAF.  TFV exposure was similar for both diasteroisomers, although 
exposure in PBMCs was higher following dosing with TAF than with GS-7339.  The effect of food led to 
a decrease in overall plasma exposure of TFV and TAF (2.5 fold).  
When male Beagle dogs were given a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg TAF, there was rapid absorption 
and elimination, t max was less than 0.5 h and t½ ranged from 0.2-0.9 h. The pharmacologically active 
metabolite, TFV-DP was the major metabolite in liver achieving a Cmax of 126 µM at 4.0 hours post-
dose. 
Following daily oral administration of 8.29 mg/kg TAF for 7 days to male Beagle dogs, the plasma and 
liver pharmacokinetic profiles were determined on day 1 and 7 (Study No. AD-120-2033). TAF was 
rapidly absorbed and exhibited a short terminal half-life (t½) of 0.3 hours in plasma on both Day 1 and 
7. The rapid disappearance of TAF was accompanied by an increase in TFV.  Tenofovir was the major 
metabolite detected in plasma achieving a maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) of 1.47 and 2.12 μM 
on Day 1 and 7, respectively.  The pharmacologically active diphosphate metabolite, TFV-DP, was 
efficiently formed in dog livers achieving concentrations of 242 and 153 μM at 4.0 and 24 hours post-
dose on Day 7, respectively. 
The plasma PK of TAF and TFV and TFV levels in PBMCs were determined during the course of a 28-day 
oral gavage toxicity study in adult male and female beagle dogs following daily administration of either 
vehicle, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, or 10 mg/kg/day GS-7340-02 (Study No. D990175-PK).  Repeat dosing at 
10 mg/kg/day resulted in nonlinear pharmacokinetics between Days 1 and 28 with TAF median AUC 
values of 0.454 and 0.985 μg·h/mL, Cmax values of 582 and 1280 ng/mL, and t½ λz values of 18 and 
23 minutes, respectively.  The TFV Cmax values appeared to be linear with increasing dose as well as 
repeat dosing.  The TFV t½ was estimated to be 37 h and substantial accumulation of TFV was 
observed after repeat dosing. The TFV levels in PBMCs were not linear with increasing dose; however, 
a linear correlation was observed between TFV levels in PBMCs and corresponding trough plasma 
concentrations. PBMC concentrations were approximately 100-fold higher than corresponding plasma 
concentrations. 
In a 9-month toxicology study in dog, tenofovir alafenamide monofumarate was administered once 
daily at doses of 0, 2, 6, and 18 mg/kg/day (Study No. TOX-120-002).  The dose of 18 mg/kg/day was 
decreased to 12 mg/kg/day on Day 2 of Week 7 for males and Day 2 of Week 8 for females due to 
severe clinical signs and reduced body weight and food consumption.  The concentrations of GS-7340 
and tenofovir in plasma samples and total TFV in Week 39/40 PBMC samples were determined.  GS-
7340 was rapidly absorbed and converted to tenofovir following oral dose administration, with peak 
plasma concentrations of GS-7340 (free base) and tenofovir occurring at 0.5 and 1 hour post-dose, 
respectively. GS-7340 was eliminated rapidly from the plasma with a terminal phase half-life of less 
than 1 hour. The median t½ of tenofovir was estimated to be in the range of 25 to 31 hours on Day 1. 
The plasma pharmacokinetics of GS-7340 and tenofovir were comparable between male and female 
dogs after oral administration.  Plasma Cmax and AUC values for TAF increased more than 
proportionally over the dose range of 2 to 18/12 mg/kg/day.  The plasma TFV Cmax and AUC 
increased roughly dose proportional.  There was some accumulation of tenofovir following repeat

dosing (~3-fold). Tenofovir concentrations in PBMCs were measurable at 24-hour postdose for all dose 
groups.  The median terminal phase half-life of total tenofovir in PBMCs was estimated to be 31 hours 
(similar to the tenofovir plasma estimate) from the recovery animals with PBMC concentrations 
measured up to 72 hours.  Dose-normalized PBMC mean AUC values of total tenofovir increased more 
than dose proportionally during Week 39/40. 
Monkey: 
Single dose pharmacokinetics for TAF and TFV, and TFV in PBMCs was determined using rhesus 
monkeys administered single oral doses of GS-7340-02 at 0.5, 5.0, and 50 mg/kg (Study No. 
P2000087). Tenofovir alafenamide and TFV levels increased rapidly with tmax values of approximately 
0.5 and 1 hour, respectively. Levels of TFV in PBMCs were also detected, levels of TFV persisted in 
PBMCs for up to 96 h and persisted to a higher extent to samples treated with acid phosphatase 
suggesting that a significant proportion of TFV-related material in PBMCs was in phosphorylated forms. 
Distribution 
The extent of binding of TAF to plasma protein was determined using dog and human plasma only 
(Study No. AD-120-2026).  Rat plasma was not included as TAF is highly unstable in rat plasma due to 
the presence of a high number of esterases.  Protein binding of TAF was moderate in dog and human 
plasma with the percent unbound values of 48.0% and 46.8%, respectively.  The in vitro values are 
slightly higher than those observed using ex vivo samples from TAF treated humans which ranged from 
14 – 23%.  For the use in the interaction studies, the percentage of unbound TAF was round up to be 
20%.   
The protein binding of TFV has been determined in human plasma and serum using centrifugal 
ultrafiltration (Study No. P0504-00039.1). Percent of unbound TFV was 99.3 ± 3.3% in human plasma, 
and 92.8 ± 3.6% in human serum.  Tenofovir therefore showed very low protein binding in either 
human plasma or serum. 
Extensive tissue distribution studies with TAF were completed using mice, rats and dogs.   
Male CD-1 mice were treated with a single oral dose of 100 mg/kg [14C]TAF (Study No. AD-120-
2011).  Most tissues reached maximum concentration by 1 hour postdose.  The tissues showing the 
highest maximum concentrations of radioactivity, excluding GI tract, included liver, gall bladder, 
urinary bladder, diaphragm, kidney cortex, kidneys, and kidney medulla.  The tissues with the lowest 
Cmax values were testis, brain cerebrum, fat (abdominal), spinal cord, and brain medulla.  Similar 
distribution profiles were seen in male C57 Black (pigmented) mice.  More persistent exposures in eye 
lens, eye uveal tract, and eyes were observed in CD57 black mice compared to CD-1 mice, although 
there was no indication that there was a difference in distribution between pigmented and non-
pigmented skin, or that TAF was more preferentially distributed to melanin-containing tissues. 
Male SD or Long Evans rats were administered oral 5 mg/kg [14C]TAF (Study AD-120-2020).  There 
was rapid distribution to most tissues, both to pigmented and non-pigmented rats.  The tissues 
showing the highest maximum concentrations of radioactivity included kidney cortex, kidney(s), kidney 
medulla, and liver.  The tissues with the lowest Cmax values were brain olfactory lobe, seminal 
vesicle(s), eye vitreous humour, thymus, eyes, testis(es), and harderian gland for Sprague-Dawley 
rats and bone, brain olfactory lobe, seminal vesicle(s), fat (abdominal), muscle, eye vitreous humour, 
and eye(s) for Long Evans rats.  There was no indication that there was any difference in distribution 
between pigmented and non-pigmented animals, binding to melanin was unlikely.

The distribution of TAF and TFV in pregnant and lactating animals has been evaluated.  In pregnant 
rats, rabbits and monkeys the extent of placental transfer of TAF and TFV was measured during the 
embryo-fetal developmental studies.  In rats there was a clear increase in TFV exposure with 
increasing dose of TAF (Study Nos. TX-120-2001 and TX-120-2002).  Multiple dosing in the dose-range 
finding study showed signs of accumulation of TFV, however this was not seen in the definitive study.   
In rabbits, there was an increase in exposure to TAF and TFV with increasing dose, with no evidence of 
accumulation (Study Nos TX-120-2004 and TX-120-2005).   
In the monkey the extent of placental transfer of TFV following subcutaneous administration was 
determined in pregnant rhesus monkeys (Study No. 96-DDM-1278-005).  Placental transfer of TFV 
appeared to be significant with a foetal/maternal serum concentration ratio of 0.17 ± 0.07 (mean ± 
SD) at approximately 30 minutes post-dose. 
Metabolism 
Tenofovir alafenamide is subject to intracellular metabolism to TFV, which is further phosphorylated to 
the anabolites, TFV-MP and TFV-DP with TFV-DP being the pharmacologically active form.   
The applicant has proposed a possible metabolism pathway based upon the findings from mice, rats, 
dogs and humans (Figure 5). TAF is also subject to intracellular metabolism to TFV, which is further 
phosphorylated to the anabolites, tenofovir-monophosphate and TFV-DP with TFV-DP being the 
pharmacologically active form.

In vitro Metabolism 
The potential for CYP enzymes to metabolise TAF was assessed by incubating TAF with 6 individual 
bacterially expressed human CYP enzyme preparations co-expressed with human NADPH CYP 
reductase (Study No. AD-120-2004). Metabolism of TAF was not detected by CYP1A2, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP 2D6.  Tenofovir alafenamide was slowly metabolised by CYP3A4 at a rate of 
1.9 min-1 which was 26.6% of the positive control, testosterone.

Intracellular metabolic activation of TAF in PBMCs or other lymphatic tissues involves conversion to TFV 
by cathepsin A.  In contrast to PBMCs, TAF was primarily hydrolysed by carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) in 
primary hepatocytes.  Tenofovir is then further phosphorylated to TFV-DP by cellular nucleotide 
kinases.  
The in vitro activation of TAF in human primary hepatocytes was evaluated and compared with that of 
TDF and TFV (Study No. AD-120-2017). Following a 24-hour continuous incubation of primary 
hepatocytes with 5 µM TAF, TDF, or TFV, the levels of GS-77938 increased to 1,470, 302, and 12.1 
pmol/million cells illustrating that incubation with TAF resulted in 5- and 120-fold higher intracellular 
levels of GS-77938 compared to TDF and TFV, respectively. 
The in vitro metabolism of [14C]TFV was studied in dog plasma, in control and induced (Aroclor 1254) 
rat liver microsomes, and also in dog liver and intestinal S9 fractions (Study No. 96-DDM-1278-003).  
Tenofovir was recovered unchanged under all conditions: no metabolites were detected in either rat 
microsomal preparation, with or without the addition of NADPH cofactor.  There was no evidence of 
chiral inversion either.  
In vivo Metabolism: 
The metabolic profiles of TAF were determined in plasma, urine, faeces, kidney, liver, and nasal 
turbinate from mice (Study No. AD-120-2012); in plasma, urine, bile, and faeces from rats (Study No. 
AD-120-2021); and in plasma, urine, bile, faeces, bone, and liver from dogs (Study No. AD-120-2008).  
The metabolite profiles were also determined in human plasma, urine, and faeces following 
administration of a single oral dose of [14C]TAF (Study No. GS-US-120-0109).  
TFV accounted for a majority of drug related material in plasma, urine, and faeces from all species 
except for human plasma, in which uric acid (M27B) was the predominant metabolite accounting for 
73.9% of the total AUC over 96 hours.  Uric acid is also detected to a large extent in mouse plasma 
(19.4%).  M18 was the major metabolite in rat bile accounted for 63% of total radioactivity recovered 
in bile. M18 and its oxidised metabolite, M16 were the major metabolites in dog bile accounted for 29 
and 38% of total radioactivity recovered in bile.  Various oxidative metabolites were found in dog bile.  
No metabolites unique to human were observed. 
The extent of TFV transformation to TFV-DP was examined in PBMCs, red blood cells (RBCs) and lymph 
nodes from monkeys (Study No. P2001025).  Animals were administered a single dose of 15, 30, or 60 
mg/kg of [14C]TFV subcutaneously. TFV was taken up by PBMCs and anabolised to TFV-DP, with 
intracellular concentrations of the active antiviral anabolite reaching 1.6 µM (60 mg/kg dose group).  
The half-life of TFV-DP in this experiment was >50 hours. A similar pattern developed in RBCs and 
lymph nodes. The long intracellular half-life in this respect supports the proposed once daily clinical 
dosing regimen.  
Excretion 
Excretion of oral radiolabelled TAF has been reviewed across mice, rats and dogs.   
Mice were administered a single oral dose of 100 mg/kg [14C]TAF (Study No. AD-120-2011).  
Recovery of radioactivity was 61% from urine and faeces 48 hours post-dose.  An average of 41.3 and 
27.7% of the administered radioactivity were excreted in faeces and urine, respectively, by 168 hours 
post-dose. 
Male bile duct-intact and BDC male SD rats were given a single 5 mg/kg oral dose of 14C]TAF (Study 
No. AD-120-2020).  [14C]TAF was rapidly excreted within 24 hours after oral dosing.  The mean 
Assessment report

values of 71.9 and 22.2% of the administered radioactivity were excreted in faeces and urine, 
respectively, by 168 hours post-dose.  The mean overall recovery of radioactivity was 96.7%.   
Excretion of radiolabelled TFV was examined following IV administration at doses of 10 or 50 mg/kg to 
SD rats.  Excretion was 85.2 ± 7.63% at 24 hrs, and 92.7% ± 6.77 % by 7 days postdose in urine.  
Faecal elimination was 3.18% ± 1.85% by 24 hours, and 4.48% ± 1.89% by 7 days postdose. 
In dogs the excretion of [14C]TAF was determined after administration of a single 15-mg/kg oral dose 
of 14C-TAF to bile duct-intact and BDC male dogs (Study No. AD-120-2007).  [14C]TAF was readily 
excreted mostly within 48 hours after oral dosing.  The mean values of 37.4% and 35.9% of the 
administered radioactivity were excreted in faeces and urine, respectively, by 168 hours post-dose.  
Overall mean recovery of radioactivity was 80.4%. 
Excretion of radiolabelled TFV was evaluated in dogs following a single IV dose of [14C]TFV (Study No. 
96-DDM-1278-002).  The primary route of elimination was via urine, where 70.03% of total 
radioactivity was recovered.  Total faecal recovery of radioactivity was 0.42% of the total dose. 
Bile excretion: Bile excretion has been examined in both rat and dog studies following oral 
administration with radiolabelled TAF.  3.2%, and 2.11% of the administered radioactivity were 
excreted in faeces, urine, and bile, respectively, by 168 hours post-dose.  The mean overall recovery 
of radioactivity after oral dosing to BDC rats was 99.9%. 
The excretion of [14C]TAF was determined following oral administration of a single 15-mg/kg dose of 
[14C]TAF to male dogs (Study No. AD-120-2007). Mean values of 42.7%, 26.5%, and 14.0% of the 
administered radioactivity were excreted in faeces, urine, and bile, respectively, through 168 hours 
post-dose.  Based on the radioactivity excreted in urine and bile, a minimum of approximately 41% of 
the orally administered dose was absorbed.  Elimination via biliary excretion appears to be the major 
route of elimination of [14C]TAF in dogs.  The overall recovery of radioactivity in BDC dogs was 86.2%.   
Excretion to milk: The extent of TFV excretion in lactating monkeys was evaluated.  Milk was obtained 
from 2 lactating adult female rhesus monkeys following a single 30 mg/kg subcutaneous dose of TFV 
(Study No. P2000116).  TFV was detected in the milk, the AUC in milk was between 18.6-21.5% of 
that seen in plasma. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
The potential for TAF to be involved in drug-drug interactions has been assessed in a range of in vitro 
test systems.  The potential of TAF or its metabolites to inhibit or induce CYP enzymes and serve as 
substrates or inhibitors of xenobiotic transporters was assessed. The effect of other drugs, including 
other antiviral agents that may be co-administered with TAF, on intestinal stability and the absorption 
potential was also determined. Considering the data generated using ex vivo human tissue the extent 
of unbound TAF was estimated to be 20% of total exposure.  
Inhibition of Cytochrome P450 enzymes and UGT1A1: 
The potential for TAF and TFV to inhibit human CYP-mediated drug metabolism was examined in vitro 
using hepatic microsomal fractions and enzyme-selective activities (Study Nos. AD-120-2003 and 
V990172-104).  Inhibition of the following CYP450 enzymes was evaluated, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A.  TAF at a concentration of 25 µM was shown to weakly inhibit 
CYP3A with an IC50 ranging from 7.4 to 7.6 µM.  TFV did not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, 
CYP2E1, and CYP3A.   
Assessment report

In Study No. AD-120-2040, the potential for TAF to be a mechanism based inhibitor of human CYP 
enzymes was investigated.  TAF at a concentration of 50 µM had no effect on inhibition to any of the 
tested isoenzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6). Tenofovir alafenamide 
did not inhibit UGT1A1 up to 50 µM (IC50 > 50 µM) (Study No. AD-120-2006). 
Enzymology of Metabolism 
To examine whether TAF may be metabolised by intestinal esterases and/or CYP enzymes following 
intestinal absorption, the effects of other HIV PIs and CYP inhibitors was explored in Study No. AD-
120-2027. TAF was incubated with HIV-1 PIs (atazanavir or darunavir) or CYP inhibitors (ritonavir or 
COBI) at concentration of up to 100 µM.  The stability of TAF was unaffected by the presence of these 
CYP inhibitors or PIs.  
In order to investigate which enzymes are involved in activation of TAF in human hepatocytes, TAF was 
incubated alongside known CatA inhibitors (approved hepatitis C virus NS3 inhibitors, telaprevir and 
boceprevir), CES1 inhibitor (bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate, BNPP), CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor (COBI), or 
telaprevir and BNPP together (Study No. AD-120-2031).  BNPP inhibited the metabolism of TAF in a 
dose dependent manner.  Formation of the active constituent of TAF, TFV-DP was unaffected on co-
incubation with telaprevir, boceprevir, or COBI.  Combining BNPP and telaprevir resulted in an 
enhanced level of inhibition.  From the results of this study it is implied that TAF is primarily 
hydrolysed by CES1 and CatA.  
Induction Liability 
The ability of TAF to induce CYP enzymes/activity, P-gp or UGT1A1 was examined using cultured 
human hepatocytes treated with 1, 10, and 100 µM TAF once daily for 3 consecutive days (Study No. 
AD-120-2032). 
There was evidence of cytotoxicity following dosing with 100 µM TAF with reduced CYP activity 
however increased mRNA levels.  After treatment with 10 µM TAF, the mRNA levels of CYP1A2 and 
CYP3A4 increased by 3.0- and 8.3-fold which correspond to 3% and 6% of control levels.  This 
demonstrates that TAF has a potential to induce CYP isoenzymes at 10 µM but this was reduced to 
little or no induction potential at 1 µM. There was no evidence of a change in induction potential for P-
gp or UGT1A1 mRNA.  
The potential for TAF to induce human drug metabolising enzymes and drug transporters through the 
activation of human AhR or human PXR was further evaluated in cell-based systems (Study No. AD-
120-2005). At a concentration of 50 µM TAF was only able to activate PXR at 23% of a positive control, 
rifampicin.  This effect reduced to less than 5% with a dose of 15 µM TAF. Activation of AhR was not 
observed following dosing with 50 µM TAF. TAF is unlikely to activate either PXR or AhR xenobiotic 
receptors.   
Potential for Transporter-Mediated Drug Interactions with TAF and TFV: 
The ability of TAF and/TFV to affect to action of drug transporters has been explored in a number of in 
vitro studies. The relevant transporters affected by TAF (transporter substrates and inhibition) are 
shown in Table 9 (transport inhibition).

TAF 
In terms of inhibiting drug transporters, TAF was unable to inhibit P-gp, BCRP, OAT1, OAT3, and OCT2 
(Study No.s. AD-120-2019 and AD-120-2036). Inhibition to OATP1B1, OATP1B3, BSEP, OCT1, and 
MATE1 was observed but only to a small extent, i.e. at doses that were 200-fold in excess to clinical 
meaningful exposures.  See clinical assessment report for discussion in relation to OATP. 
In terms of TAF acting as a substrate to drug transporters, TAF has been shown to be a substrate for 
intestinal efflux transporters, P-gp and BCRP.  There is an increase in TAF absorption in the presence of 
cyclosporine A (CsA) and COBI (inhibitors of P-gp and BCRP) (Study Nos. AD-120-2037 and AD-120-
2013).  In a study completed in which dogs were orally administered TAF at 2 mg/kg following 
untreated or pretreated animals with 75 mg/kg CsA, there was increased exposure to TAF in the CsA 
pretreated animals, although this had no effect on the overall level of TFV present.  The increased TAF 
Assessment report  
EMA/793580/2016  
Page 34/156 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
plasma exposure led to an increase in levels of TFV-DP detected in PBMCs, suggesting that co-
administration of TAF with an efflux transport inhibitor (i.e. COBI) would increase absorption and also 
result in higher levels of the active anti-viral substance, TFV-DP.  See clinical report for further 
discussion on transporters. 
TAF was found to be a substrate for hepatic uptake transporters, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3.  Exposure to 
TAF may be affected by inhibitors of these transporters or genetic polymorphisms that affect the 
transport activities.  Unlike TFV, TAF was not a substrate for renal transporters, OAT1 and OAT3. 
TFV 
The route of elimination of TFV is renal excretion by a combination of glomerular filtration and tubular 
secretion.  In order to understand the role of transporters in the renal secretion of TFV and to explore 
potential drug interactions based on these transport systems, the interactions of TFV with a variety of 
both uptake and efflux transporters were studied in vitro.   
Results of in vitro transport studies indicate that the active tubular secretion of TFV is mediated by 
human OAT1 (basolateral uptake) and MRP4 (apical efflux) transporters acting in series in proximal 
tubules (Study Nos. PC-103-2001, AD-104-2001, AD-104-2002).  Human OAT3 may play a secondary 
role in the tubular uptake of TFV.  Neither P-gp nor MRP2 appear to be involved in the efflux of TFV.  
See clinical report for further discussion on transporters.  
As the primary transporter handling the uptake of TFV, OAT1 has been assessed for its potential role in 
drug interactions between TFV and other renally secreted therapeutics including antibiotics, anti-
inflammatory agents, and other antivirals (including PIs).  Under physiologically relevant conditions, 
none of the tested drugs affected OAT1-mediated transport of TFV, indicating a low potential for renal 
interactions with TFV due to inhibition of this pathway (Study No. PC-104-2010 and Study No. PC-104-
2011).  
COBI also shows no detectable inhibition of human OAT1 or OAT3.  Similarly, PIs ATV, LPV, and RTV 
did not exhibit any effect on the active cellular elimination of TFV mediated by the MRP4 efflux pump, 
and COBI is a very weak inhibitor of MRP4.  The results of in vitro drug interaction studies indicate that 
PIs or COBI are unlikely to exert any substantial effect on the renal elimination of TFV in general or 
result in the accumulation of TFV in renal proximal tubules.  
The results from in vitro studies investigating the contribution from MRP1 in tubular reabsorption of 
TFV (Study No. PC-104-2014) indicated that MRP1 is not involved in the reabsorption of TFV at the 
basolateral membrane of proximal tubule cells.  
TFV did not inhibit the activity of human OCT2 or MATE1 (IC50 >300 μM) so TFV is unlikely to cause 
drug interactions through inhibition of these transporters (Study No. AD-104-2012). 
Tenofovir alafenamide was efficiently taken up and metabolized in primary human hepatocytes. TAF 
was shown to be taken up by untransfected CHO cells at a rate of 9.0 pmol/min/106 cells indicating 
that TAF has high passive permeability. Uptake was higher with the cells expressing hepatic uptake 
transporter, OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 with rates of 12.0 or 24.1 pmol/min/106 cells, respectively and 
rifampin inhibited the transporter dependent uptake. Atorvastatin and antipyrine were used as positive 
and passive permeability controls, respectively. These results showed that TAF is a substrate for 
hepatic uptake transporters, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 (Study number: AD-120-2022).  
Effect of an OATP inhibitor, rifampicin on uptake of TAF into primary human hepatocytes was assessed 
in vitro. The results from four different hepatocyte donors suggested that OATP-mediated transport 
makes a small contribution to TAF uptake (Study number:  AD-120-2042). Taken together, the

Applicant goes onto say that it is likely that the major route of TAF uptake into hepatocytes is passive 
permeability. The Applicant goes onto say that, while exposure to TAF may be affected slightly by 
inhibitors of these transporters or genetic polymorphisms that affect the transport activities, the effects 
of differences in OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 activity are, not expected to be clinically relevant given the 
high passive permeability of TAF. See clinical assessment report for discussion in relation to OATP. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
In support of this application, tenofovir alafenamide was evaluated in mouse, rat, dog, and non-human 
primate repeat-dose toxicity studies up to 39 weeks in duration. In vitro and in vivo genotoxicity 
studies were conducted. Rat fertility and developmental toxicity studies were conducted, along with 
developmental and reproductive toxicity studies and a local irritation study in the rabbit. The vehicle 
for toxicity studies used was 1) 25mM citric acid or 2) 0.5% polysorbate 20, 0.5% 
carboxymethylcellulose, 0.9% benzyl alcohol or 3) 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and 0.1% (v/v) 
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC). 
In agreement with the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/629722/2012; EMEA/H/SA/2410/1/2012/1), no carcinogenicity studies were 
conducted due to the lack of TAF exposure in rats and TgRasH2 mice and lower TFV exposure in rats 
and mice compared to the same studies in which TDF was administered. No peri/postnatal study was 
conducted based on scientific advice adopted by CHMP (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/ 214541/2013; 
EMEA/H/SA/2410/1/FU/1/2013/1). As with the carcinogenicity study rationale, there is an inability to 
measure plasma concentrations of TAF in rats, and TFV exposure after TAF administration was less 
than that already tested in the TDF peri/postnatal study. 
In the development of TAF, 3 forms of the active drug substance were used: GS-7340, synonym for 
GS-7340 as the free base; GS-7340-02, synonym for GS-7340 as the monofumarate (1:1 molar ratio 
of free base to fumaric acid), and GS-7340-03, synonym for the hemifumarate (2:1 molar ratio of free 
base to fumaric acid). The hemifumarate, GS-7340-03 (TAF fumarate) is the selected for final 
development. It is stated that GS-7340-03 is considered comparable to GS-7340-02 based on 
physical/chemical properties and both exist as the free base in blood and biological fluids.  
Repeat-dose toxicity studies used GS-7340-02 however the applicant states that any potential effects 
of the hemifumarate have been evaluated by studies of the monofumarate. The hemifumarate, GS-
7340-03 was used in the male and female fertility study, dermal and ocular irritation studies, the local 
lymph node assay, and a second impurity qualification study.

Single dose toxicity 
In male and female Sprague-Dawley rats (5/sex/group) given an oral dose (15 mL/kg) of TAF at 100, 
300, or 1000 mg/kg (80, 240, 800 mg/kg free base equivalents [f.b.e.]/kg) followed by a 14-day 
observation period (study number: R990185) the NOAEL was considered to be 1000 mg/kg. 
Male and female beagle dogs (1/sex/group) were given a single oral dose (15 mL/kg) of 30, 90, or 270 
mg/kg (24, 72, 216 mg f.b.e./kg) TAF followed by a 14-day observation period (Study number: 
D990181). In-life observations of salivation, vomiting, reduced activity, tremors, incoordination seen at 
270 mg/kg which resolved 2 days following dosing. There was an increase in blood urea nitrogen at 
270 mg/kg (present on study Day 2, not study Day 14. Thymus weights were at all doses compared 
with controls, and thymic atrophy was present in males at 90 and 270 mg/kg. Renal tubular changes 
characterised by basophilia and/or karyomegaly were present in the male at 270 mg/kg and females at 
270 mg/kg and 90 mg/kg. The NOAEL as considered to be 30 mg/kg. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Mouse 
A two week mouse study was conducted; however the results were not interpretable due to a large 
number of confirmed gavage errors and the viscosity of the formulation. These data will not be 
discussed in this report. 
13-Week GLP Oral Mouse Toxicity Study (study number TX-120-2007)

The vehicle used was 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and 0.1% (v/v) hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC). 
Reduced body weight gain was seen at 100 mg/kg/day in males and at all doses in females. Reduced 
food consumption was noted at 30 and 100 mg/kg/day. In the nasal turbinates an increased incidence

and severity of  minimal to slight infiltrates of neutrophils in respiratory and olfactory mucosa, and 
minimal to moderate (100 mg/kg/day only) degeneration of olfactory epithelium was seen in both 
sexes at all doses. In addition adverse findings were noted in the nasal turbinates (exudate in the 
lumen) of both sexes at 30 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day. Minimal infiltrates and minimal olfactory 
degeneration were observed at a lower incidence in control animals. Minimal increased apoptosis of the 
rectum was seen in males and females at 100 mg/kg/day. No NOAEL could be determined. Due to 
limited concentration data for TAF, AUC values could not be calculated. At week 13, the TFV AUCtau 
(combined sexes) was 0.213 μgh/mL at 10 mg/kg/day. 
Rat 
4-Week Oral Rat Toxicity Study (Study number R990182) 
Daily oral administration of tenofovir alafenamide monofumarate (15 mL/kg) at 1.5, 6.25, 25, 100, 
and 400 mg/kg/day (1.2, 5, 20, 80, 320 mg free base equivalents (f.b.e.)/kg/day) to SD rats 
(10/sex/group) for 28 days resulted in decreased body weight gain, reduced food consumption, 
decreases in white blood cell (WBC) and RBC parameters, calciuria, decreased bone mineral density 
(BMD), decreased 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D3, renal karyomegaly, thymic atrophy, and atrophy of 
cancellous bone of the femur. Most effects were seen at 400-mg/kg/day group; however, some 
changes were noted at 25 mg/kg/day with a non-significant decrease in 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D3 
observed at 6.25 mg/kg/day. Based on changes in WBCs, the NOAEL was considered to be 6.25 
mg/kg/day (no change in WBC count was observed at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day in the subsequent 
26-week rat toxicity study – see below). 
26-Week Oral Rat Toxicity Study (TOX-120-001) 
Daily oral administration of TAF (monofumarate) at 5, 25, and 100 mg/kg/day (4, 20, 80 mg 
f.b.e./kg/day) to SD rats (15/sex/group) for 26 weeks resulted in minimal renal cortical tubular 
karyomegaly (100 mg/kg/day) and minimal to slight tibial cancellous bone atrophy (females, 100 
mg/kg/day), changes in bone density measurements (100 mg/kg/day) and changes in biochemical 
markers of bone turnover (25 and 100 mg/kg/day) were also noted. These effects were not observed 
at 5 mg/kg/day. TAF (GS-7340-02) dose-dependently increase biochemical markers of bone turnover 
in males and dose-independently decrease serum 1,25-dihydroxy- and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in both 
sexes at 25 and 100 mg/kg/day. It is stated that as the effects (increases in biochemical markers of 
bone turnover and changes in related hormones) seen at 25 mg/kg/day were minimal, it was 
concluded that the NOAEL was 25 mg/kg/day. 
Toxicokinetic analysis of plasma samples showed that TAF was rapidly absorbed after oral dosing and 
was rapidly converted to TFV. No consistent differences in plasma pharmacokinetics were found 
between the sexes. Tenofovir was eliminated from the plasma with half-lives ranging from 7 to 13 
hours. Mean TFV Cmax and AUC values for combined sexes increased dose proportionally over the 
dose range of 5 mg/kg/day to 100 mg/kg/day at each study period. 
Rabbits 
Daily oral administration of TAF (monofumarate) at 20, 50 and 75 mg/kg/day to female rabbits, for 7 
days, was generally well tolerated (Study number TX-120-2003). Plasma exposure to TAF and TFV 
generally increased with increase in dose level from 20 to 75 mg/kg/day. Values for mean Cmax and 
AUC0-t of TFV were generally higher on Day 7 than on Day 1. TAF was rapidly and extensively 
converted to TFV. The mean TAF AUC0-t on day 7 was unable to be calculated at 20 mg/kg/day (due 
to values below the lower limit of quantitation of 1.00 ng/mL) and was 0.252 and 1.174 μg·hr/mL at 
Assessment report  
EMA/793580/2016

50 and 75 mg/kg/day, respectively. The mean TFV AUC0-t on day 7 was 2.256, 5.741 and 10.070 
μg·hr/mL at 20, 50, and 75 mg/kg/day, respectively. 
Dog 
4-Week Oral Toxicity Study (Study number : D990175) 
Daily oral administration of TAF (monofumarate) at 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg/day (0.08, 0.24, 0.8, 
2.4, 8 mg f.b.e./kg/day) (Study number D990175) to male and female beagle dogs (4/sex/group) for 
28 days resulted in increased AST in females at 10 mg/kg/day and renal tubular karyomegaly and/or 
basophilia in both sexes at 10 mg/kg/day and 1 male and 1 female at 3 mg/kg/day. Mean values for 
bone specific alkaline phosphatase, N telopeptide, parathyroid hormone, 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D and 
25 hydroxyvitamin D were generally similar across all groups. There were no effects on peripheral 
quantitative computed tomography-derived bone densitometry parameters (eg, bone mineral content 
and bone mineral density of the total slice and trabecular and cortical/subcortical compartments). The 
NOAEL was considered to be 1 mg/kg/day. 
At the lower doses, only Cmax and Tmax values for TAF were determined as most values were below 
the lower limit of quantitation of the assay. TAF was rapidly absorbed on Day 1, with median peak 
values within 0.25 to 0.5 hours of 18.5, 38.7, and 0.582 μg/mL at 1.0, 3.0, and 10 mg/kg/day, 
respectively. Peak TFV concentrations occurred within 1 hour. At 10 mg/kg/day, Day 28 TFV Cmax and 
AUCtau were 0.44 μg/mL and 5.26 μgµh/mL, respectively (males and females combined). Comparisons 
between Day 1 and Day 28 at 10 mg/kg/day showed potential accumulation upon repeat dosing. 
Tenofovir in PBMCs was measurable (18.6 μg/mL) after 28 days of 10 mg/kg/day TAF. 
39-Week Oral Toxicity Study with a 3 month recovery period (Study number: TOX-120-002). 
Male and female beagle dogs were administered daily oral doses (10 mL/kg) of TAF (monofumarate) at 
2, 6, or 18/12 mg/kg/day (1.6, 4.8, 14.4/9.6 mg f.b.e./kg/day) for 13 weeks (2/sex/group) or 39 
weeks (4/sex/group). A dose-related decrease in body weight gain at 39 weeks was seen in all males 
at all doses and for females at18/12 mg/kg/day. The dose for the high dose group was reduced from 
18 to 12 mg/kg/day on Days 45 and 51, for males and females, respectively, due to the occurrence of 
severe clinical signs and reduced body weight.  
There were 2 unscheduled deaths (2x males at 18 mg/kg). One of these was considered to be due to a 
gavage accident. A different male at 18 mg/kg was killed on Day 45 due to deteriorating clinical 
condition, which was considered to be treatment related. Prior to necropsy this animal had shown 
reduced body weight; reduced food consumption; increased AST, globulin levels, triglyceride, 
cholesterol, total bilirubin; and decreased monocyte and platelet counts. Macroscopically, there was 
bilateral enlargement of the submandibular lymph nodes, which histologically had slight inflammation 
and plasmacytosis. Histopathology consisted of mild, mononuclear infiltrate in the ocular posterior 
uvea; renal cortical tubular degeneration; atrophy of GALT, mesenteric lymph node, and thymus 
accompanied by an infiltrate of macrophages; mucosal atrophy of the fundic gland; mucosal 
hyperplasia of the pyloric gland; and mucosal degeneration and/or regeneration in the cecum and 
colon. 
Increased mean AST (~2.6x compared to control) and total bilirubin (~1.6x compared to control) in 
dogs administered 18/12 mg/kg/day. No ECG changes occurred at 2 mg/kg/day. At Week 39, a dose-
related prolongation of PR interval was observed at 6 (~ +13%) and 18/12-mg/kg/day (~ +24%) 
groups. TAF reduce heart rate with an associated QT interval prolongation was seen at 18/12 
mg/kg/day. According to the Applicant these changes were associated with decreases in serum

triiodothyronine (T3).  After the 13-week recovery period, serum T3 values returned to levels similar to 
the controls. 
The applicant stated that all bone markers showed age-related decreases. After 3 months, there were 
some differences noted among mean values for bone formation (skeletal alkaline phosphatase [sALP]) 
and bone resorption markers (urinary free deoxypyridinoline and N telopeptide) at all doses compared 
to controls. After 9 months, statistically significant increases in mean values for the bone resorption 
marker urinary N telopeptide were noted for both sexes at 18/12 mg/kg/day (p ≤0.05), compared to 
controls. A similar though not statistically significant trend was noted in animals at 6 mg/kg/day, 
suggesting a dose-related response. No significant changes in free deoxypyridinoline were observed, 
with no consistent effects (increases) among treated groups. For the formation marker, serum ALP 
values at all doses were comparable controls except for one male at 18/12 mg/kg/day, which was 
outside the control ranges. At the end of the recovery period, bone marker values returned to below 
the control range consistent with an age effect and recovery from treatment. 
At 18/12 mg/kg/day administered once daily to young beagle dogs for 39 weeks changes in bone 
densitometry parameters (by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry [DXA] analysis) considered to reflect 
primarily effects on bone growth were observed. These changes were considered by the Applicant as 
secondary to the effects on body weight. 
Histopathology changes were noted in the kidneys, eyes, lungs, and spleen after both 13 and 39 
weeks. The liver and possibly the adrenal glands were additional target organs identified after 39 
weeks. After 13-weeks of treatment, findings of renal cortical tubular degeneration/regeneration and 
karyomegaly were seen at 6 or 18/12 mg/kg/day; findings after 39 weeks of treatment were similar. 
These changes were minimal to slight (Grade 1 to 2) at 6 mg/kg/day in both sexes. At 18/12 
mg/kg/day severity ranged from mild to moderate (Grade 2 to 3). After 39-weeks of treatment, similar 
lesions (minimal (Grade 1) karyomegaly and tubular degeneration) were seen in 2 males at 2 
mg/kg/day.  
A minimal to slight (Grade 1 to 2) infiltration of mononuclear cells in the ocular posterior uvea was 
noted in some animals at 18/12 mg/kg/day after both treatment periods. Alveolar histiocytosis was 
present in the lungs after 13-weeks at 18/12 mg/kg/day. Additional pulmonary findings noted following 
39-weeks of treatment and consisted of macrophage accumulation with pigment, which was detected 
predominantly at 18/12 mg/kg/day and in few animals at 6 or 2 mg/kg/day. An infiltration of 
macrophages laden with pigment was very frequently seen in the splenic white pulp at 18/12 
mg/kg/day after both treatment periods. After 39 weeks of treatment, centrilobular hepatocellular 
cytoplasmic acidophilic inclusions were seen at 18/12 mg/kg/day, pigment deposits in hepatic 
macrophages and/or sinusoidal cells (Kupffer cells) was seen at 18/12 mg/kg/day. Also, similar 
pigment deposits in the sinusoidal cells (tissue macrophages) of the adrenal glands were seen in a few 
animals at 18/12 mg/kg/day. The Applicant stated that the cause of the intracellular pigment in tissue 
macrophages in the lung, liver, spleen, and adrenal is not known, but could represent accumulation of 
the test article and/or test article metabolite(s) in these cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system. 
After the 13-week recovery period, test article-related histological changes were still present in the 
kidneys, lungs, and liver, but were however reduced in incidence and severity. 
At 18/12 mg/kg/day, a minimal infiltration of histiocytes was present in some organs (eye [choroid 
plexus, ciliary body], lung, and spleen) in some animals. In-life ophthalmologic examinations were 
normal. 
The NOAEL after 39 weeks of treatment was considered to be 2 mg/kg/day. Treatment-related findings 
were completely or partially reversible following a 13-week recovery period.

Toxicokinetic analysis showed that TAF was rapidly absorbed and converted to TFV following oral dose 
administration, with peak plasma concentrations of TAF and TFV occurring 0.5 and 1 hour after dosing, 
respectively. The systemic exposure of TAF was dose dependent. Plasma Cmax and AUC values for GS-
7340 increased more than proportionally over the dose range. Plasma Cmax and AUC, increased 
roughly in proportion to the administered dose. There was some accumulation of TFV following repeat 
dosing (approximately 3-fold). There were no gender differences in exposure. 
Tenofovir concentrations in PBMCs were measurable at 24 hours after dosing at all doses. The median 
terminal phase half-life of total TFV in PBMCs was estimated to be 31 hours (similar to the TFV plasma 
estimate) from the recovery animals with PBMC concentrations measured up to 72 hours. Dose-
normalised PBMC mean AUC values of total TFV increased more than dose proportionally during Week 
39/40. 
Non-human primate  
4-Week Oral Rhesus Monkey Toxicity Study (Study number P2000114) 
Animals were given TAF (GS-7340-02) at 3 or 30 mg/kg/day (2.4, 24 mg f.b.e./kg/day) or TFV at 15 
mg/kg/day. According to the company, there were no adverse in-life effects and no clear test article-
related effects on body weight, serum chemistry, plasma chemistry, haematology (including 
lymphocyte subsets determined by flow cytometry), standard urinalysis parameters, organ weights, 
and bone-related or histologic parameters. There was 1 death at 30 mg/kg/day TAF, which was not 
considered test article-related (no further details are provided on the toxicology summary). Kidney, 
liver and skeletal muscle samples assayed for indicators of mitochondrial integrity showed no effects. 
The NOAEL for TAF was considered to be 30 mg/kg/day.  
The TAF Cmax values were nonlinear with dose, with greater than expected increases in Cmax with 
dose. The TAF AUCtau could only be calculated at 30 mg/kg/day group, with a mean value of 1.03 
µg·h/mL and a terminal elimination half-life of 0.335 hours. There were no gender differences in 
exposure. 
Day 28 TFV Cmax and AUC exhibited slightly greater than proportional increases with increasing dose. 
Comparison between Days 1 and 28 showed no statistical difference for Cmax or AUC indicating no 
change in clearance over time. There were no gender differences in exposure. 
Key findings  
Kidney 
Renal tubular karyomegaly was observed in rats and dogs orally administered TAF. Focal areas of 
minimal renal cortical tubular basophilia and associated minimal nuclear karyomegaly were present in 
rats at 400 mg/kg/day (4 weeks) and 100 mg/kg/day for 26 weeks. Renal tubular karyomegaly and/or 
basophilia were observed in dogs at 3 and 10 mg/kg/day (4 weeks) and dogs at 6 or 18/12 mg/kg/day 
for at least 13 weeks. Renal cortical tubular degeneration/regeneration findings was seen at 6 or 18/12 
mg/kg/day (13 weeks) in the 39-week dog toxicity study. Similar findings of renal cortical tubular 
degeneration/regeneration and karyomegaly were seen in dogs given 6 or 18/12 mg/kg/day for 39 
weeks. These changes were minimal to slight in affected males and females at 6 mg/kg/day. At18/12 
mg/kg/day the severity ranged from mild to moderate. Similar lesions (minimal karyomegaly and 
tubular degeneration) were seen in 2 males at 2 mg/kg/day (39 weeks). After a 13-week recovery 
period, test article-related histology changes were still observed in the kidney but were of reduced 
incidence and severity.

Bone 
Atrophy of metaphyseal cancellous bone was observed in rats at 100 mg/kg/day for 26 weeks. TAF 
also increased biochemical markers of bone turnover and decreased serum 1,25-dihydroxy- and 25-
hydroxyvitamin D3 in rats (≥  25 mg/kg/day) and dogs (≥  37.5 mg/kg/day for 6 days). In These 
findings were accompanied by statically significant decrease in serum 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D3 in 
males only and a significant increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in females only. 
Nasal turbinates 
Adverse degenerative (olfactory) and acute inflammatory (infiltrate neutrophil) changes in the nasal 
mucosa were noted in mice given TAF for 13 weeks. These findings were not seen in rats, dogs, or 
non-human primates for longer durations of administration. It is stated that the relevance to humans 
is unknown and the risk of nasal inflammation in humans is very low. 
Cardiovascular  
Prolong PR intervals (approximately 13% to 24%), which was associated with significant decreases in 
triiodothyronine (T3) was noted in the 39 week dog study. After the 13-week recovery period, serum 
T3 values returned to levels similar to the control group animals at the end of the study.  
Eye 
At 18/12 mg/kg/day in dogs (39 week dog study), a minimal infiltration of histiocytes was present in 
some organs (eye [choroid plexus, ciliary body], lung, and spleen) in some animals. In-life 
ophthalmologic examinations were normal. The applicant states that the histiocytic infiltration 
observed in multiple organs was most likely an indirect test article-effect due to general debilitation 
and were not observed in other repeat-dose toxicity studies. There were no test article-related effects 
on ophthalmic exams or microscopic exams of ocular tissue observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies in 
mice (up to 13 weeks), rats (up to 26 weeks), nonhuman primates (4 weeks), or in the 4-week dog 
toxicology study.  
The posterior uveitis in dogs administered seen at 18/12 mg/kg/day in the 39 week dog study 
occurred at 3.7- and 17-fold higher exposure to TAF and TFV, respectively, than that observed in 
human subjects administered a 25-mg dose of TAF. No difference in distribution was observed between 
Sprague-Dawley and Long Evans rats, including in the skin and eyes, suggesting no binding to 
melanin. It is stated that because TAF has poor penetration across the blood brain and blood retinal 
barrier in dogs, it is unlikely that TAF directly caused the observed histiocytic infiltration in the 
posterior uvea. Based on the data from tissue distribution and toxicology studies (see below), it is 
unlikely that these findings would translate into a concern regarding the ocular safety of TAF and were 
probably due to the poor condition of these animals during the in-life phase of the study. However 
there was one adolescent with uveitis considered to be drug-related by the investigator. At present it 
seems appropriate to keep this issue under close review with appropriate reflection in the RMP. 
Distribution of 14C-TAF to eyes has been assessed in mice, rats, and dogs (AD-120-2011, AD-120-
2020, and D990173-BP). Melanin binding has specifically been assessed by comparing distribution in 
pigmented and non-pigmented mice (C57 black and CD-1, respectively) and rats (Long Evans and 
Sprague-Dawley, respectively). [14C]-TAF-related radioactivity distributed poorly to the eyes of rats 
and dogs (Cmax in eyes <8% that observed in plasma). Transient exposure to low levels of [14C]-
TAF-related radioactivity was observed in the eyes of rats decreasing to undetectable levels at 8 hours 
postdose. No difference in distribution was observed between Sprague-Dawley and Long Evans rats, 
including in the skin and eyes, suggesting no binding to melanin. The distribution of [14C]-TAF to eyes 
in mice was higher than other species studied (Cmax in eyes 15%-20% that observed in plasma).

More persistent exposures in eye lens, eye uveal tract, and eyes were observed in C57 black mice 
compared to CD-1 mice.

Carcinogenicity 
Based on the scientific advice adopted by the CHMP (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/629722/2012; 
EMEA/H/SA/2410/1/2012/1), carcinogenicity studies are not required for TAF registration based on the 
lack of TAF exposure in rats and TgRasH2 mice and lower TFV exposure in rats and mice compared to 
TDF.

Daily administration of TDF at dose levels of up to 300 mg/kg/day administered for 104 weeks did not 
reveal any evidence of carcinogenicity in mice. At 600 mg/kg/day, a low incidence of duodenal 
tumours was observed, possibly related to high local test article concentration in the gastrointestinal 
tract. In rats, daily administration of TDF at dose levels up to 300 mg/kg/day did not reveal any 
evidence of carcinogenicity. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
The reproductive and developmental toxicity of TAF was evaluated in a fertility and early embryonic 
development to implantation study in rats, embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits. 
Based on the scientific advice adopted by CHMP(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/214541/2013; 
EMEA/H/SA/2410/1/FU/1/2013/1), a peri/postnatal study in rats is not required for TAF registration 
due to the lack of TAF exposure in rats and lower TFV exposure compared to TDF. 
Oral Fertility and General Reproduction Toxicity Study of TAF in Sprague-Dawley Rats (Study 
number TX-120-2012).  
Male and female Crl:CD(SD) rats were given 20, 80, or 160 mg free base equivalent (f.b.e.)/kg/day 
(22, 90, 180 mg tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) hemifumarate/kg/day. Males were necropsied after at 
least 10 weeks of dosing, the reproductive organs were weighed followed by assessment of sperm 
motility and total concentration. Male and female reproductive performance was evaluated based on 
results of confirmation of mating and pregnancy. There were some effects on male body weight at 80 
and 160 mg/kg/day and female at 160 mg/kg/day throughout the study.  
There were no differences in premating estrous cycles. There were no test article-related differences in 
male or female reproductive parameters. There were no test article-related effects on the uterine and 
foetal parameters and no significant differences in female reproductive organ weights. There was a 
slight increase in absolute testis weight (significant increase (9%) in the adjusted mean of the left 
testis only) at 160 mg/kg/day. This was considered by the Applicant to be test article-related but not 
adverse, as there were no other reproductive organ weight or functional reproductive effects. There 
were no test article-related effects observed on mean epididymal sperm motility or on sperm 
concentration. The NOAEL for male and female toxicity was 80 mg/kg/day. The TAF NOAEL for 
reproductive and early embryonic toxicity was 160 mg/kg/day.  
Oral Embryo-Foetal Development Study of TAF in Rats (Study number: TX-120-2002) 
Four groups of 25 pregnant female Crl:CD(SD) rats were given daily doses of TAF (monofumarate), by 
oral gavage, from GD 6 to 17, inclusive. Targeted dose levels were 0 (vehicle control), 25, 100 and 
250 mg/kg/day. Dose formulation analysis showed that each 5 mg/kg/day animal was administered a 
GS-7340-02 concentration of 3.85 mg/mL instead of 5 mg/mL for 5 to 8 days between GD 10 and 17, 
providing a daily dose of 19.3 mg/kg/day (77% of targeted dose) on these days. Dose formulation 
analysis showed that each 20 mg/kg/day animal was administered a GS-7340-02 concentration of 12.9 
mg/mL instead of 20 mg/mL for 4 to 7 days between GD 6 and 12, providing a daily dose of 64.6 
mg/kg/day (65% of targeted dose) on these days. 
At 250 mg/kg/day a statistically significant decrease in the number of animals noted with incomplete 
ossification of the interparietal and hyoid bones was noted at 250 mg/kg/day. Other minor skeletal 
anomalies were comparable in incidence to controls. At this dose group body weights, body weight 
gains and food consumption were significantly decreased during the treatment period. On GD 21, the 
mean body weight of the 250 mg/kg/day group was 10 % lower than that of the controls. Mean 
corrected body weights (body weight on GD 21 minus gravid uterus weight) and mean corrected body

weight gains (body weight gain on GD 6 to 21 minus gravid uterus weight) were also lower at 250 
mg/kg/day, with the corrected mean body weights also 10% lower than controls on GD 21. Foetal 
weights (males, females and sexes combined) were decreased dose dependently and remained within 
the range of historical control data, however foetal weights at 250 mg/kg/day were at the lower 
extreme of this range. The incidences of foetal major malformations, minor external, visceral and 
skeletal anomalies and were not affected by TAF. Sternebrae variants (1 to 4 and 5 and 6) were 
increased at 250 mg/kg/day.  
In summary, at 250 mg/kg/day, there was decreased fetal body weight associated with some delays in 
the rate of ossification. There was no evidence of embryolethality or teratogenicity attributed to TAF in 
this study. The maternal TAF NOAEL and the TAF NOAEL for embryo-fetal development were both 
considered to be 100 mg/kg/day, which resulted in GD17 AUC0-t values of 17.4 and 0.2 μg·hr/mL for 
TFV and TAF, respectively. 
Plasma concentrations of TAF were all below the lower limit of quantitation at 25 mg/kg/day. Exposure 
to TAF increased with the increasing dose from 25 to 250 mg/kg/day. Exposure to TFV increased with 
the increase in TAF dose from 25 to 250 mg/kg/day. 
Oral Embryo-Foetal Development Study of TAF in Rabbits (TX-120-2005) 
TAF (monofumarate) was administered by oral gavage to time-mated F0 generation female rabbits (20 
main study females per group and 3 toxicokinetic females per group) at 0 (vehicle control), 10, 30 and 
100 mg/kg/day. Lower body weight gains were noted at 100 mg/kg/day for the first week following 
treatment initiation. Lower food intake was noted at 100 mg/kg/day from GD 8 to 24. Three animals at 
this dose consumed less than 30 g for at least 4 days during the dosing period. There were no TAF-
related macroscopic changes. The number of corpora lutea, implantation sites, live fetuses, dead 
fetuses, resorptions, the sex ratio and the pre and post implantation losses were not affected. There 
was no effect of TAF on foetal weights. The incidence of major malformations, minor external, visceral, 
skeletal anomalies and common skeletal variants were not affected by TAF. 
Exposure to TAF increased increasing dose (10 to 100 mg/kg/day). The increases in Cmax were 
greater than proportional between 10 to 100 mg/kg/day and the increases in AUC0-t were greater 
than proportional between 30 to 100 mg/kg/day on GD 20. Exposure to TFV increased with increasing   
TAF doses from 10 to 100 mg/kg/day. The increases in Cmax and AUC0-t were roughly proportional 
between the 10 to 100 mg/kg/day. Accumulation of TFV was observed after multiple dosing. 
Concentrations of TFV were higher than concentrations of TAF, indicating that TAF was extensively 
converted to TFV. The TAF NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 30 mg/kg/day (AUC0-t = 1.1 and 5.0 
μg·h/mL for TAF and TFV, respectively) and the TAF NOEL for embryo-foetal development was 100 
mg/kg/day (AUC0-t = 11.0 and 27.3 μg·h/mL for TAF and TFV, respectively. 
Local Tolerance  
In a bovine corneal opacity and permeability assay (BCOP) TAF (GS-7340-03) elicited an in vitro 
irritancy score of 21.0 ± 8.7 with a 4-hour incubation and was predicted to be a noncorrosive/non-
severe eye irritant. 
In a dermal irritation study in rabbits animals were given a single 4 hour, semi-occlusive, dermal 
administration of approximately 0.5 g of TAF (GS-7340-03 and were observed for 4 days (Study 
number: TX-120-2011). No local dermal reaction was observed in any animal throughout the duration 
of the study. The Primary Irritation Index was calculated to be 0.0; TAF was classified as a ‘non-
irritant’.

Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity 
Female mice were given TAF (GS-7340-03) at of 10, 25 or 50% w/v. The animals were administered 
TAF by daily application of 25 μL of the appropriate concentration or control (vehicle or positive), to 
the dorsal surface of both ears for 3 consecutive days. The proliferative response of the lymph node 
cells (LNCs) from the draining auricular lymph nodes was assessed 5 days following the initial 
application, by measurement of the incorporation of 3H-methyl thymidine (3HTdR) by β-scintillation 
counting of LNC suspensions.  
The response was expressed as radioactive disintegrations per minute per lymph node (dpm/node) and 
as the ratio of 3HTdR incorporation into LNC of test nodes relative to that recorded for control nodes 
(test/control ratio), termed as SI. The test substance is regarded as a sensitizer if at least one 
concentration of the chemical has a SI of 3 or more. The SI obtained for 10%, 25%, and 50% w/v 
were 0.9, 1.0, and 1.0, respectively, which indicates that TAF did not show the potential to induce skin 
sensitisation. The EC3 value (the “estimated concentration of 3” is the concentration of test substance 
which would result in a SI of 3 in the LLNA) was determined to be higher than 50% w/v. The SI for the 
positive control substance hexyl cinnamic aldehyde was 6.3, which demonstrates the validity of this 
study. 
Studies on impurities 
A 2 week oral rat (males) study was conducted to evaluate the toxicity and to qualify potential 
impurities of TAF. Animals were given GS-7340-02 at 5 or 50 mg/kg/day (10 mL/kg) from 2 different 
purity lots (Lot No. 1 - 97.7% and Lot No. 2 - 83.1% )]. The impurities, including 13% GS-7339, were 
added to the more pure lot. No test article-related findings were noted, and no differences were found 
between the 2 lots tested.  
A 4 week oral rat (males and females) study was conducted. Three lots of GS-7340-03 were each 
administered at 25 and 50 mg/kg/day (free base equivalents). Test article 1 was 99.3% pure GS-
7340-03. Test article 2 was 98% pure GS-7340-03 containing 11 spiked impurities. Test article 3 was 
97.8% pure GS-7340-03 containing 4 spiked impurities. There were no significant in-life or 
histopathological differences between the 3 lots tested. The NOAEL for all 3 lots is 50 mg f.b.e./kg/day. 
Based on their impurity profiles, the multiple GLP batches of TAF tested in the toxicology program are 
considered, in composite, to be representative of the GMP material and support the specified limits of 
impurities and degradation products proposed for commercial production.  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
A full environmental risk assessment (ERA) has been provided in accordance with the Guideline on the 
Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human use [EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00].  
Phase I 
A PBT screening was performed. Based on an experimentally derived logKow of -4.3 at pH 7 which is 
below the trigger value of 4.5, it can be concluded that tenofovir is not potentially PBT. Hence, no 
further PBT assessment is necessary.  
Assessment report  
EMA/793580/2016  
Page 46/156 
 
 
 
 
 
The initial PECsurfacewater was calculated based on the maximum daily dose of 28 mg tenofovir 
alafenamide fumarate under the assumption of the default market penetration factor (Fpen) of 0.01. 
The resulting PECsurfacewater for tenofovir alafenamide fumarat is 0.14 µg/l which clearly exceeds the 
trigger value of 0.01 µg/l. Consequently, a Phase II assessment was performed.  
Phase II Tier A 
Tenofovir alafenamide is a pro-drug which is rapidly converted into the active moiety tenofovir after 
absorption. Consequently, the ERA was performed with tenofovir for the aquatic compartment. The 
study on transformation in water/sediment systems showed a significant shifting of the active 
substance into the sediment. Therefore, a toxicity test on sediment dwelling organism was performed 
as well. Terrestrial studies are considered not necessary as the adsorption coefficient is lower than the 
respective trigger value of 10 000 L/kg.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacology of tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) has been appropriately investigated in a range of in 
vitro and ex vivo studies.  
Prolonged PR intervals (approximately 13% to 24%) with associated QT interval prolongation were 
noted in the 39 week dog study with TAF. No PR prolongation or any change in ECG results occurred in 
the safety pharmacology study that evaluated a TAF dose up to 100 mg/kg or in the clinical TQT study.  
Other safety pharmacology studies revealed no significant concerns for TAF. The absorption, 
distribution, metabolism and excretion of TFV/TAF were evaluated in vitro and in a variety of animal 
models.  
The kidney and bone findings seen in the rat and dog toxicology studies are known toxicities of TFV.. 
At 18/12 mg/kg/day in dogs (39-week dog study), a minimal infiltration of histiocytes was present in 
some organs (eye [choroid plexus, ciliary body], lung and spleen) in some animals. The posterior 
uveitis seen at 18/12 mg/kg/day occurred at 3.7- and 17-fold higher exposures to TAF and TFV, 
respectively, than that observed in human subjects administered a 25 mg dose of TAF. In-life 
ophthalmologic examinations were normal in this study. There was one adolescent with uveitis 
considered to be drug-related by the investigator. At present it seems appropriate to keep this issue 
under close review as reflected in the RMP.

There were no test article-related effects on ophthalmic exams or microscopic exams of ocular tissue 
observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies in mice (up to 13 weeks), rats (up to 26 weeks), nonhuman 
primates (4 weeks, or in the 4-week dog toxicology study. Adverse degenerative (olfactory) and acute 
inflammatory (infiltrate neutrophil) changes in the nasal mucosa in mice given TAF for 13 weeks were 
not seen in other species and it can be agreed that they probably do not pose a clinical risk. 
In the rat fertility and reproductive toxicology study an increase in absolute testis weight (significant 
increase [9%] in the adjusted mean of the left testis only) was seen at 160 mg/kg/day. This was 
considered by the applicant to be test article-related but not adverse, as there were no other 
reproductive organ weight or functional reproductive effects. Sternebrae variants (1 to 4 and 5 and 6) 
were increased at 250 mg/kg/day in the rat embryo-foetal development study (the NOEL was 
considered to be 100 mg/kg/day [84 mg/kg/day achieved]). There were no effects seen the embryo-
foetal development study in rabbits. Given that no peri-/postnatal study was conducted with TAF, the 
product literature should contain the reproductive findings seen with TDF (i.e. reduced viability index 
and weight of pups in peri-/postnatal toxicity studies at maternally toxic doses). 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No major concerns have been identified from the nonclinical data.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Formulation 
The proposed commercial TAF 25 mg film-coated tablets are identical to those used in the pivotal 
bioequivalence and Phase 3 trials. 
Methods 
Analytical methods 
The method for determination of TAF in human plasma was validated at Quest Pharmaceutical 
Services, L.L.C (QPS). It involved protein precipitation extraction of TAF and its internal standard (TAF-
d7) from human plasma followed by LC MS/MS with positive ionization. The linear range was from 1 to 
1000 ng/mL. 
Tenofovir (TFV) was assayed in plasma at QPS using a range of validated assays over time that 
involved the extraction of TFV and stable isotope internal standard (TFV-d6) from human plasma using 
Assessment report  
EMA/793580/2016

protein precipitation followed by LC-MS/MS with positive ionization. The linear range was from 5-300 
ng/mL for Phase 3 samples and 0.3 - 300 ng/mL in the final more sensitive assay.  
The bioanalytical method for the simultaneous determination of TAF and TFV in human urine was 
developed and validated at QPS. The method involved protein precipitation extraction of TAF, TFV and 
internal standards (TAF-d7 and TFV-d6, respectively) from human urine followed by LC MS/MS with 
positive ionization. The linear range was 2-1000 ng/mL for TAF and 10-5000 ng/mL for TFV. 
Absorption  
Absolute bioavailability 
Absolute bioavailability has not been determined for TAF but the applicant estimates that this is ~ 40% 
in the absence of P-gp inhibition or induction. The effect of P-gp inhibitors and inducers on TAF 
bioavailability was evaluated in several studies.

GS-US-311-1088 was an open-label crossover study in which subjects received  F/TAF (200/25 mg) 
and FTC 200 mg + TAF 25 mg. Dosing was after completion of a 600 kcal and 27% fat meal. 
Bioequivalence was demonstrated for each of TAF and FTC. TFV levels were not reported due to failure 
of the incurred sample reliability measure. The bioanalytical report states that the QCs spiked with TAF 
plus TFV showed conversion of TAF to TFV, particularly when the TAF:TFV ratio was high.

In GS-US-292-0103 healthy subjects with mean eGFRCG at baseline of 126.9 mL/min received the

A: EVG 150 mg/COBI 150 mg/FTC 200 mg/TAF 10 mg 
C: FTC 200 mg + TAF 25 mg (i.e. co-administered) 
Each treatment was administered once daily with food for 12 days with no washout periods. 
The TAF and TFV exposures following administration of 10 mg TAF in Group A were comparable to 
those observed following administration of TAF 25 mg in Group C. Plasma TFV was slightly higher when 
TAF 10 mg was administered with a P-gp inhibitor (COBI) but the mean (%CV) TFV AUC and Cmax 
were > 90% lower than observed following administration of TDF within Stribild in GS-US-236-0110.

Study title: A Phase 1, Randomized, Open-Label Study to Determine the Effect of Food on the 
Pharmacokinetics of Tenofovir Alafenamide (TAF) in Healthy Volunteers 
The study compared administration of TAF 25 mg in the fed (800 kcal and 50% fat) and fasted states. 
TFV was not measured in this study. The applicant points out that the food effect on plasma TAF 
observed on administration of TAF 25 mg tablets (AUC 65%–68% higher vs. fasted) was consistent 
with the findings of the F/TAF study GS-US-311-1386 (see below), in which F/TAF (200/25 mg) was 
given with a similar meal type (increased TAF AUC 75% to 77%). As noted in prior dossiers, the 
finding contrasts with the small food effect observed when TAF 10 mg was given with COBI (see GS-
US-292-0110 below), indicating that food has little effect when TAF is given with a potent P-gp 
inhibitor.

The range of TAF exposures after dosing with the 25 mg tablet was consistent with the plasma 
exposures observed in the HBV monotherapy study (GS-US-320-0101; see section 2.2) in which 8 mg, 
25 mg, 40 mg and 120 mg TAF doses were administered under fasted conditions. Based on the flat 
antiviral effect in the monotherapy study the applicant considers that the effect of food is not clinically 
relevant.

Pharmacokinetics of Tenofovir Alafenamide When Administered as a Single Tablet Regimen Containing 
Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Alafenamide in Healthy Volunteers 
GS-US-292-0110 was an open-label crossover study that evaluated TAF and TFV PK when TAF 10 mg 
was given as part of the E/C/F/TAF STR under fasted and fed conditions. Dosing was on days 1, 8 and 
15 with E/C/F/TAF 10 mg in the fasted state (reference) or after: 
•  A light/low-fat meal of approximately 400 kcal and 20% fat 
•  A high-calorie/high-fat meal of approximately 800 kcal and 50% fat 
Administration under fed conditions resulted in a lower TAF Cmax and delayed Tmax with a magnitude 
of effect that was similar between meal types. The GLSM ratios and 90% CI for TAF AUClast after each 
meal type exceeded 100% but the upper 90% boundaries were 124% and 126%.

The TFV AUCinf GLSM ratios and 90% CI when E/C/F/TAF was administered after food also all 
exceeded 100% but fell within 80, 125%. As for TAF there was a decrease in Cmax (~15%) with a 
corresponding delay in median Tmax (from 0.75 to 1.50 h). These modest changes in TAF and TFV PK 
parameters upon E/C/F/TAF administration with food were not considered clinically relevant.

GS-US-311-1386 evaluated the effect of food on F/TAF 25 mg tablets. Dosing was on days 1 and 8 
with a single F/TAF 200/25 mg tablet in the fasted state (A; reference) or after a high-calorie/high-fat 
meal of approximately 800 kcal and 50% fat (B; test).  
Administration of F/TAF under fed conditions resulted in a slightly lower TAF Cmax and delayed Tmax 
(by 30 min). In contrast the GLSM ratios for TAF AUCs were ~175% (90% CI ~165, 188) for the fed 
vs. fasted state. TFV was not measured in this study.

Distribution 
In the TAF metabolite profiling study GS-US-120-0109 the mean whole blood-to-plasma 
concentration ratio of [14C]radioactivity increased from 0.6 at 0.25 h post-dose to 2.4 at 216 h post-
dose, suggesting slower clearance of radioactivity from blood cells relative to plasma. Radioactivity was 
not detectable in blood for 6/8 subjects at 504 h post-dose and the others had low radioactivity levels 
at this time point that were close to the LLOQ. 
In several human ex vivo studies the estimated unbound fraction of TAF was ~20%, i.e. lower than 
reported in vitro. In subjects with severe hepatic impairment (GS-US-320-1615), the mean percentage 
of unbound TAF ranged from 35% to 40% vs. 19-22% in the controls with normal hepatic function.

Metabolism 
In GS-US-120-0109 healthy male volunteers (median eGFRCG 117.5 mL/min; range 87.7 to 198.2 
mL/min) received a single TAF 25 mg capsule containing 24.15 mg TAF plus 100 μCi [0.85 mg] 
radiolabeled [14C]TAF. Dosing was with water within 5 minutes of completing a standardised 
breakfast.  
Quantifiable levels of [14C]radioactivity were observed in whole blood for up to 360 h post-dose in 
most subjects but radioactivity was undetectable in plasma after 192 h post-dose.  
Quantifiable levels of TAF were observed in plasma for up to 6 h post-dose and then remained BLQ. 
TAF was extensively metabolised with only 1.41% (± 0.561%) of the total radioactive dose appearing 
in urine as TAF and no radioactive TAF was detected in faeces.

recovered in faeces and 86% of the radioactivity recovered in urine.

Metabolite profiling (pooled samples) showed two concentration peaks in the plasma [14C]radioactivity 
profile:  
•  At the first maximal plasma radioactivity concentration around 2 h post-dose the predominant 
species was TAF, accounting for 72.6% of the total [14C]radioactivity quantified.  
•  At the second maximal plasma radioactivity concentration around 24 to 48 h post-dose the 
predominant species was uric acid, accounting for 97.6% of the total [14C]radioactivity 
quantified.  
Over 96 h post-dose the predominant species circulating in plasma was uric acid, which accounted for 
73.9% of the total [14C]radioactivity AUC. The TAF and TFV AUCs represented 1.8% and 1.5% of the 
total [14C]radioactivity AUC, respectively. Low quantities of other metabolites were formed including 
xanthine, hypoxanthine and adenine (identical to the endogenous products of purine metabolism).

Figure 6.  GS-US-120-0109: Tentative Pathways for Metabolism of TAF by Humans 
Additional information comes from in-vitro studies that assessed the stability of TAF in plasma, 
intestinal S9 and hepatic S9 fractions from humans. TAF was moderately stable in human plasma and 
intestinal S9 fractions with half-lives of 74.7 and 58.3 minutes, respectively. TAF stability in human 
intestinal S9 fractions was also determined in the presence of HIV PIs resulting in a lower half-life of 
24.5 minutes. TAF was relatively less stable in human hepatic S9 fractions with a half-life of 20.6 
minutes. The predicted human hepatic extraction ratio was calculated to be 76.2%. 
Using bacterially expressed human CYP enzyme preparations (Bactosomes), co-expressed with human 
NADPH CYP reductase, metabolism of TAF was not detected by CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or 
CYP 2D6. TAF was slowly metabolised by CYP3A4 (1.9 min-1), which was 26.6% of that for 
testosterone. 
Inter-conversion 
TAF has 3 chiral centres. The potential for in-vivo isomerisation to occur was addressed as part of the 
E/C/F/TAF review and is considered to be negligible.  
Consequences of possible genetic polymorphism 
In hepatocytes the initial step of TAF metabolism is hypothesised to be driven by a combination of 
CatA and CES1. This differs from the hypothesis that CatA alone effects the conversion in PBMCs.  
CES1 is highly expressed in liver. Because CES1 is an enzyme with high capacity and low affinity, it is 
not readily inhibited by other xenobiotics. To date, there are no clinical reports of modulation of PK 
profiles of CES1 substrates by xenobiotics that inhibit CES1. In addition, since the in-vitro study AD-
120-2031 indicated that CatA also contributes to TAF activation in hepatocytes, inhibitors of CES1 are 
unlikely to negatively affect the antiviral activity of TAF.  
Assessment report  
EMA/793580/2016  
Page 62/156 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Several CES1 genetic variants that are associated with the enzyme activity have been identified at very 
low frequency [G143E (heterozygous: 2%-4% and homozygous: 0.05%) and D260fs (very rare)]. The 
G143E polymorphism modestly affected activation of oseltamivir by 18% in humans. Again, since TAF 
can be hydrolysed by both CES1 and CatA in liver, significant modulation of TAF PK profiles by 
inhibition or genetic polymorphisms of CES1 is unlikely. 
Genetic polymorphisms in CatA have been described, some of which can result in depressed enzymic 
activity. The potential for an effect of human polymorphisms on TAF efficacy was addressed during the 
review of prior dossiers. The most detailed information was provided during the review of F/R/TAF. 
Small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA)-mediated knock-down of CatA and fibroblasts isolated from 
patients with a genetic disorder resulting from a lack of CatA activity (galacosialidosis) had reduced 
intracellular accumulation of TAF metabolites in vitro. Genetic polymorphisms in CatA (CTSA gene) 
have been found in patients with galactosialidosis. Galactosialidosis is considered extremely rare but 
the exact prevalence is unknown. While greater than 100 cases have been reported, only 23 mutations 
have been identified as of 2013. No patients with galactosialidosis have knowingly been treated with 
TAF for HIV or HBV. Since conversion occurs via two routes in hepatocytes the applicant proposes that 
genetic polymorphisms leading to reduced CatA activity and inhibition of CatA by telaprevir or 
boceprevir may not effect conversion of TAF to TFV-DP in hepatocytes that express CatA and CES1. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality 
In studies in which a range of TAF doses were used, including the monotherapy studies and the TQT 
study, there was very approximate dose proportionality for TAF and TFV. 
Time dependency 
In GS-US-120-0109 plasma radioactivity showed two peaks and a time-dependent profile with TAF as 
the most abundant species in the first few hours and uric acid predominating in the remaining period.  
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
The inter-subject variability in plasma TAF exposure (AUC) varied across studies depending on whether 
intensive or sparse sampling was employed (%CV: 32% to 48% across Phase 1 studies and 58% to 
71% across the Phase 3 HBV studies GS-US-320-0108 and GS-US-320-0110). 
Similarly, the inter-subject variability in TFV exposure (AUC) varied across studies depending on 
whether intensive or sparse sampling was employed (%CV: 20% to 65% across Phase 1 studies and 
29% to 36% across the Phase 3 HBV studies GS-US-320-0108 and GS-US-320-0110). 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
POPPK analyses were initially performed for TAF and TFV using PK data collected from E/C/F/TAF 
studies. A new POPPK analysis (November 2015) was included in the current application that includes 
PK data from the Phase 1 and Phase 3 studies in HBV-infected patients. Therefore this new analysis is 
the most relevant.

a Intensive PK sampling was conducted in PK substudies. 
Data from individuals who received TAF or F/TAF were combined since TAF exposures are comparable 
for TAF 25 mg and F/TAF 200/25 mg. The model was used to identify covariates (e.g. food effects, 
body weight, age, sex, race, renal and liver function, effects of co-administered ARVs and population 
[healthy vs. CHB or HIV]) influencing plasma concentrations. A mixed-effect modeling approach using 
NONMEM Version 7.3 software was applied.  
TAF - The final population model that best described TAF PK was a 2-compartment model with 
sequential zero- and first-order absorption. The typical apparent systemic TAF CL/F was estimated to 
be 149 L/h. TAF was absorbed at a typical rate of 6.24 h−1 with no lag time. The covariates retained in 
the final model were dosing conditions (fed vs. fasted), effect of co-administration of ATV/r and LPV/r, 
disease status and sex. ATV/r and LPV/r increased TAV relative bioavailability by 82% and 39%, 
respectively. Relative bioavailability was 39% higher in females and apparent central volume was 34% 
lower in patients with HIV. Fasting increased the absorption rate by 65% and decreased bioavailability 
by 17%. Administration of food immediately before the dose and co-administration with ATV/r 
decreased the absorption rate by 45% and 31%, respectively. The final population PK model 
characterised TAF PK well and no covariates were considered to have a clinically meaningful effect on 
TAF exposure.  
TFV - The final population model that best described TFV PK was a 2-compartment model with 
sequential zero- and first-order absorption. The typical apparent systemic TFV CL/F was estimated to 
be 75.6 L/h. TFV was absorbed at a typical rate of 3.58 h−1 with no lag time. The covariates retained in 
the final model were dosing conditions (fed vs. fasted), effect of co-administration of ATV/r, LPV/r and 
DRV/r, estimated eGFRCG, disease status (healthy vs. treatment-experienced patients with CHB vs. 
others), sex and black race. The main covariate that influenced the PK of TFV was creatinine clearance.  
For those with CrCL 50 mL/min, the apparent clearance (CLM/F), apparent central volume (VcM/F) and 
apparent peripheral volume (VpM/F) were respectively 30%, 19%, and 19% lower than for reference 
individuals with CrCL=90 mL/min. In those with CrCL of 150 L/min, the respective values were 36%, 
20% and 20% higher vs. reference individuals. The relative bioavailability was 14% higher in females. 
Assessment report  
EMA/793580/2016  
Page 64/156 
 
 
 
 
 
Apparent clearance was 11% higher in healthy volunteers. VcM/F was 22% lower in Blacks, 39% lower 
in healthy volunteers and 25% higher in treatment-experienced patients with HBV.  
Administration of food immediately before the dose and co-administration with ATV/r or DRV/r 
decreased the absorption rate by 55%, 57% and 41%, respectively. Differences in TFV exposure 
between individuals due to statistically significant covariates were less than 32% relative to the typical 
reference individual. These differences were not considered clinically meaningful. It was concluded that 
the final population PK model characterized TFV PK well and no covariates were considered to have a 
clinically meaningful effect on TFV exposure. 
The results of the integrated population PK modelling of TAF following administration of TAF or F/TAF 
were consistent with the PK of TAF following dosing as part of E/C/F/TAF. Based on POPPK analyses, 
disease status was retained as a covariate in the final model but was not considered clinically relevant 
because the differences in TAF and TFV exposures between individuals due to covariates were less than 
40%. Accordingly, the range of TAF and TFV exposures observed in healthy subjects was comparable 
to that in patients with CHB. These data were also consistent with the established PK of TAF in 
HIV-infected subjects (mean [%CV] TAF and TFV AUCtau of 206 [71.8] and 293 [27.4] ng•h/mL, 
respectively). 
The range of TFV exposures was below exposures observed in historical studies after administration of 
TDF 300 mg in patients with CHB or HIV and in those with normal renal function (3300 ng•h/mL).

A single 25 mg dose of TAF was administered after a standard meal to 14 subjects with severe renal 
impairment (15 ≤ CrCL ≤ 29 mL/min) and 13 matched controls. There were no differences in the 
protein binding fractions of TAF and TFV between those with severe renal impairment and those with 
normal renal function.

TAF - In severe renal impairment there was a 92% (< 2-fold) higher mean plasma AUCinf, 92% higher 
AUClast and 79% higher Cmax. Correspondingly the mean plasma TAF CL/F was significantly lower (p 
= 0.003) but the half-life was not statistically significantly different. At 1 and 4 h the mean percent 
unbound TAF was not different between those with severe renal impairment (20.0% and 14.2%) vs. 
controls (20.1% and 13.6%). Approximately 0.47% of the dose was excreted in urine in renally 
impaired subjects vs. ~2% in controls with renal clearance of 4.2 mL/min and 35.8 mL/min, 
respectively.

ESRD/HD Modelling Report 
The 2015 POPPK model was modified to predict the TFV plasma exposures in HBV-infected patients 
with ESRD undergoing haemodialysis. The dataset for the established model had TAF doses that 
ranged from 8 mg to 125 mg. Data from 12 studies were evaluated in the original model. The following 
modifications were incorporated: 
1)  
Haemodialysis clearance (CLDI) was incorporated for duration of 4 h on alternate days of the 
week (thrice weekly) with TAF 25 mg administration following completion of haemodialysis. 
2)  
or  
All instances of inter-occasion variability were not considered as the simulations were not study 
phase specific. 
3)  
The residual error (epsilons) was fixed to zero to reduce noise and to generate smoother 
curves. 
The dataset for simulation was generated using random sampling with replacement using the individual 
as sampling unit from the subset of data evaluated in the original model from the Phase 3 studies in 
HBV patients (n = 907). All individuals were assigned a fixed CRCL value of 5 mL/min to represent 
ESRD. The typical value for CLDI was fixed at 9.302 L/hr and inter-individual variability for CLDI was 
fixed at 0.0564.  
These observed values for known TFV CLDI with a representative method and haemodialysis technique 
were obtained from a previous study (GS-01-919) in which ESRD subjects undergoing haemodialysis 
received TDF 300 mg.  
Simulations are shown below for duration of 2 weeks to ensure that the PK profiles are at steady state 
in presence of haemodialysis. The plasma PK exposure values for Cmax, Cmin and AUC are reported 
for the time interval of 312-336 hours where the maximum daily exposures are observed.

It was concluded that the modified version of the POPPK model predicted the steady state TFV 
exposures in HBV-infected individuals with ESRD undergoing haemodialysis. Using the modelling the 
applicant concluded that no dose adjustment of TAF is required in patients with renal impairment and 
that TAF should be administered after completion of haemodialysis on the dialysis days. This is 
reflected in the SmPC.

The POPPK analyses of pooled data from Phase 3 studies in CHB patients showed that baseline eGFRCG 
was not a statistically significant or clinically relevant covariate influencing TAF PK. Note that in the 
Phase 3 studies all patients were to have eGFRCG > 50 mL/min at screening and only 4 patients with 
values < 60 mL/min provided PK data.

GS-US-120-0114 – Study title: A Phase 1, Open-Label, Parallel-Group, Single-Dose Study to 
Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics of Tenofovir Alafenamide in Subjects with Normal and Impaired Hepatic 
Function TAF in mild or moderate hepatic impairment 
In this open-label study single doses of 25 mg TAF were administered immediately after completion of 
a moderate-fat meal (600 calories, 27% fat). Study groups were: 
Cohort 1: 
•  Group 1: Subjects with mild hepatic impairment (CPT Class A score of 5-6) (n = 10) 
•  Group 2: Subjects with normal hepatic function (n = 10) 
Cohort 2: 
•  Group 1: Subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (CPT Class B score of 7–9) (n = 10) 
•  Group 2: Subjects with normal hepatic function (n = 10) 
The plasma exposure parameters of TAF and TFV were considered to be comparable between subjects 
with mild hepatic impairment and matched controls. The lower exposures vs. controls were not 
considered to be clinically relevant.

GLSMs were obtained using a mixed-effects model. 
In those with moderate hepatic impairment the plasma exposure parameters for TAF were slightly 
higher and exposures to TFV were slightly lower vs. matched controls. The differences observed were 
not considered to be clinically relevant. 
GLSMs were obtained using a mixed-effects model. 
TAF plasma protein binding at 1 and 4 h post-dose showed a mean unbound TAF range from 16% to 
19% in mild hepatic impairment and from 14% to 23% in moderate hepatic impairment. TFV plasma 
protein binding at 2 and 24 h post-dose showed a mean unbound TFV of > 99% in mild or moderate 
hepatic impairment. For TAF and TFV binding was similar to controls.

TAF in severe hepatic impairment 
The study evaluated a single 25 mg dose of TAF subjects with normal hepatic function or severe 
hepatic impairment (CPT C: score 10-15). The normal controls were matched with a CP-C subject

based on age, sex and BMI. TAF 25 mg was given after a meal (~600 calories, 25% to 30% fat). The 
mean age was 56 years (range: 41 to 69 years), mean BMI was 27.9 (4.05) kg/m2 and mean CrCL 
was 122 mL/min. The plasma exposure to TAF was lower in subjects with severe hepatic impairment.

Subjects with Severe Hepatic Impairment and Normal Hepatic Function (TFV PK Analysis Set) 
The mean percent unbound TAF was ~2-fold higher in the severe hepatic impairment subjects 
compared with control subjects (37.8% vs. 20.4%), such that the resulting comparison of free TAF 
gave similar plasma exposures between the two groups. 
Table 33.  GS-US-320-1615: Summary Statistics and Statistical Comparisons of Free TAF PK 
Parameter Estimates Between Subjects with Severe Hepatic Impairment and Normal Hepatic Function 
(TAF PK Analysis Set) 
In contrast, the percent unbound TFV was high in all subjects (> 95%) regardless of hepatic status.  
Exploratory analyses indicated no clinically relevant correlations between TAF and TFV exposures (total 
concentrations) vs. baseline CPT score. In severe hepatic impairment the lower albumin, higher total 
bilirubin, prolonged PT and higher INR values observed were correlated with lower total TAF exposures. 
Similar but less prominent trends were observed with TFV. Figures 11-12 show the plots for total TAF 
and TFV AUCs. 
When the free fraction of TAF was considered, no significant correlation was observed between the free 
TAF exposures and the individual laboratory components of the CPT score.

The applicant concluded that since free TAF is associated with therapeutic effect, no change in TAF 
efficacy is expected in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
Additional POPPK analyses assessed the relationship between TAF and TFV PK and baseline FibroTest 
score and concluded that the score was not a covariate for TAF or TFV PK.

Elderly  
The updated POPPK analyses for TAF and TFV did not show that age per se was a significant covariate 
in patients with CHB, noting that in the dataset the median age was 41 (18 to 78) years, and 
195 subjects were ≥ 50 years of age. As age is often correlated with renal function the effects noted 
above are relevant.

Paediatric population - Adolescents  
This application was confined to adults. However, in the absence of specific data for single-agent TAF 
in regards to tolerability and antiviral activity, data from TAF fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) for the 
treatment of HIV infection can be used to support approval of TAF single-agent for the treatment of 
CHB in adolescents. The single-agent TAF 25 mg exposure is equivalent to that achieved with the 10 
mg dose of TAF included in the elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/TAF (E/C/F/TAF; Genvoya) FDC 
due to inhibition of TAF pharmacokinetics (PK) by cobicistat. 
Study GS-US-292-0106, a Phase 2/3, multicenter, open-label study that characterized the PK, safety, 
tolerability, and antiviral activity of E/C/F/TAF in this population. The most recent data consist of an 
interim analysis performed when all adolescent subjects (Cohort 1) had either completed their Week 
48 study visit or prematurely discontinued study drug. 
The pharmacokinetics of tenofovir alafenamide and tenofovir were evaluated in HIV 1 infected, 
treatment naïve adolescents who received tenofovir alafenamide (10 mg) given with elvitegravir, 
Assessment report

cobicistat and emtricitabine as a fixed dose combination tablet (E/C/F/TAF; Genvoya). No clinically 
relevant differences in tenofovir alafenamide or tenofovir pharmacokinetics were observed between 
adolescent and adult HIV 1 infected subjects. 
These data demonstrate similar exposures between adolescents aged from 12 years and 35 kg and 
adults. Therefore, as TAF has been shown to be safe and effective in HIV-infected adolescents when 
given as E/C/F/TAF, it is possible to extrapolate that TAF 25 mg should also be safe and effective in 
adolescents with CHB. This extrapolation will be further confirmed via results from the planned Study 
GS-US-320-1092 as part of the agreed TAF PIP. 
Weight and BSA 
In the POPPK analyses weight and BSA did not have an effect on TAF or TFV exposure and were 
not statistically significant or clinically relevant covariates but there was a trend to decreasing AUC as 
weight increased.

exposures due to covariates were less than 40%. The overall TAF and TFV exposures observed in 
females were higher but in the range of those observed in males.

Japanese and non-Japanese subjects after single doses. However, after multiple dosing: 
• 
• 
• 
The AUCs of all analytes were lower in Japanese vs. Caucasian subjects.  
For TAF the lower bound of the 90% CI was well below 80% for AUClast. 
For TFV the lower bounds of the 90% CI were well below 80% for AUCtau and Ctau.  
GS-US-320-1228 – TAF in Japanese vs. non-Japanese 
Study Title: A Phase 1 Single Dose Study to Investigate the Pharmacokinetics, Safety and Tolerability 
of Tenofovir Alafenamide in Healthy Japanese and Non-Japanese Subjects 
Non-Japanese subjects were not of Japanese or Asian descent and their parents and grandparents 
were not born in Japan or in any Asian country. Japanese subjects were of first generation, born in 
Japan, had not lived outside Japan for > 10 years, and could trace their maternal and paternal 
Japanese ancestry of parents and grandparents. Their lifestyle, including diet, had not significantly 
changed since leaving Japan. A single dose of TAF 25 mg was administered after a standard Japanese 
breakfast. 
There were similar proportions by gender in the Japanese (3 male; 7 female) and non-Japanese (4 
male; 6 female) groups. Weight and height were lower for Japanese subjects but BMI was similar 
between groups. After a single dose the applicant concluded that PK of TAF and TFV were comparable 
between Japanese and non-Japanese subjects. 
The difference was greater for TFV than for TAF, as shown below. The supplementary tables show that 
mean and median CL/F values were slightly higher in the non-Japanese for each of TAF and TFV.

In the population PK analysis, race did not have an effect on TAF exposure in subjects with CHB and 
was not a statistically significant or clinically relevant covariate. Race (black vs. nonblack) was retained 
as a covariate for TFV in the final model but was not considered clinically relevant (differences < 40%). 
Although sample sizes were limited, the range of TFV exposures across races was comparable and 
consistently much lower than observed with TDF.

Cytochrome P450 inhibition 
• 
• 
The inhibitory activity of TAF with human liver microsomal CYP isoenzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A) was assessed at concentrations up to 25 μM. 
All IC50 values were > 25 µM except for CYP3A4. TAF showed weak inhibition of CYP3A-
mediated oxidation of midazolam or testosterone with IC50 values of 7.6 or 7.4 µM, 
respectively. 
The potential for TAF to be a mechanism-based inhibitor of human CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, 
CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6) was assessed at 50 µM. There was no 
evidence for time- or cofactor-dependent inhibition of any enzyme by TAF. The maximum 
change in activity observed was 17.4% with CYP2C8 relative to control. 
•  TFV at 100 μM did not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 or CYP3A. 
CYP induction 
CYP induction was assessed from mean fold increases in mRNA in cultured human hepatocytes from 3 
separate donors treated with 1, 10, and 100 µM TAF once daily for 3 consecutive days. Due to 
cytotoxicity cell viability was significantly affected at 100 µM TAF and mixed responses to TAF with 
increased mRNA levels and reduced CYP activities were observed. At 1 and 10 µM there were no 
significant increases in mRNA levels or CYP activities. At 10 µM TAF the mRNA levels of CYP1A2 and 
CYP3A4 increased by 3.0- and 8.3-fold, which correspond to 3% and 6% of the induction levels 
observed with respective positive controls. TAF showed little or no potential for CYP induction at 
clinically relevant concentration (1 µM).  
UGT1A1 inhibition 
TAF was assessed for inhibition of oestradiol 3-glucuronide formation in insect cell microsomal 
fractions containing baculovirus-expressed human UGT1A1. TAF did not inhibit UGT1A1 up to 50 µM. 
UGT1A1 and P-gp induction 
In similar experiments as for CYP induction, there was no significant induction of P-gp and UGT1A1 
mRNA on exposure to TAF (less than 2-fold increases).

Activation of human AhR or human PXR 
o  At 50 µM TAF the extent of activation of PXR was only 23% of the maximal effect of rifampicin 
and 15 μM TAF demonstrated activation of < 5% of the maximal induction elicited by 
rifampicin.  
o  TAF did not activate AhR up to 50 µM, the highest concentration tested.  
TAF is unlikely to activate either of these human xenobiotic receptors, supporting the in-vitro induction 
results in human hepatocytes.

GS-US-292-0101 was an open-label crossover study that compared two formulations of E/C/F/TAF 
each containing 25 or 40 mg TAF as the monofumarate) with Stribild (STB) and TAF 25 mg alone. 
Dosing was for 12 days with 2-day washouts and after a meal of 550-650 kcal and 25-30% fat.  
Cohort 1 (10 M and 10 F) received: 
•  A: STR Formulation 1 containing 150 mg EVG/150 mg COBI/200 mg FTC/25 mg TAF 
•  B: STR Formulation 1 containing 150 mg EVG/150 mg COBI/200 mg FTC/40 mg TAF 
•  C: Stribild (STB) 
•  D: 25 mg TAF 
Cohort 2 (10 M and 10 F) received: 
• 
• 
E: STR Formulation 2 containing 150 mg EVG/150 mg COBI/200 mg FTC/25 mg TAF 
F: STR Formulation 2 containing 150 mg EVG/150 mg COBI/200 mg FTC/40 mg TAF 
•  C and D as above 
Following administration of E/C/F/TAF 25 mg vs. TAF 25 mg administered alone the TAF AUClast and 
Cmax were ~2.2 and 2.3-fold higher, respectively, while TFV AUCtau and Cmax were ~3.1 and 3.7-fold 
higher, respectively. Mean TFV AUCtau and Cmax values following TAF alone were ~90% lower 
compared with those achieved after STB.

GS-US-120-0118 Study Title: A Pharmacokinetic Study Evaluating the Drug Interaction Potential of 
Tenofovir Alafenamide with a Boosted Protease Inhibitor or Unboosted Integrase Inhibitor in Healthy 
Subjects 
In GS-US-120-0118 FTC+TAF 10 mg was given with ATV/r, DRV/r, LPV/r and DTG once daily with a 
moderate fat meal.  
Mean TAF AUCs after FTC+TAF alone were generally comparable with those when it was given in the 
presence of DRV/r (cohort 2). The effect of DRV/r was ascribed to the inductive effect of DRV combined 
with the inhibitory effect of RTV on P-gp. Mean plasma DRV Cmax and AUC were not affected by co-
administration with FTC+TAF while Ctau was slightly higher (113% [95%–134%]). 
Mean TAF AUCs and Cmax after dosing with DTG were slightly higher vs. FTC+TAF given alone. DTG 
Ctau and AUC were unaffected by FTC + TAF while Cmax was lower (87% [79%–96%]).

TAF AUCs and Cmax were higher following co-administration with ATV/r or LPV/r. ATV/r had the 
greater effect on TAF AUCs. LPV/r had the greater effect on Cmax. The applicant ascribed the increases 
in TAF exposure seen with ATV/r and LPV/r to the known effect of RTV as P-gp inhibitor. It was 
concluded that F/TAF 200/10 mg should be used with these boosted PIs. Mean plasma ATV and LPV 
Cmax, Ctau and AUC values were not affected by co-administration 
Mean TFV AUC and Cmax were higher on co-administration in each cohort but the greatest effect was 
observed with LPV/r and the least with DTG.

The magnitude of effect of COBI and RTV on TAF was similar. The effect of COBI on TFV was greater 
than for TAF as was observed for RTV.

GS-US-311-0101 evaluated multiple dose co-administration of TAF 8 mg with COBI 150 mg in the fed 
state. Co-administration resulted in substantially higher TAF and TFV exposures relative to TAF 8 mg 
dosed alone, ascribed to inhibition of P-gp-mediated intestinal secretion of TAF.

In GS-US-311-0101 multiple dose co-administration of F/TAF 200/40 mg with EFV 600 mg in the 
fasted state resulted in lower exposures to TAF and TFV but the applicant concluded the effects were 
not clinically relevant based on the pre-defined acceptance criteria. The TAF and TFV Cmax values 
were also lower on co-administration.

Alafenamide and Rilpivirine in Healthy Subjects 
GS-US-120-1554 evaluated multiple doses of TAF 25 mg and RPV 25 mg given after standardised 
breakfasts for 14 days. RPV did not appear to induce P-gp since plasma PK parameters for TAF and 
TFV were unaffected by co-administration. The RPV AUC was unaffected whilst Cmax was slightly lower 
and Ctau was slightly higher.

GS-US-311-1387 evaluated the effect of steady-state carbamazepine (CBZ) on the PK of TAF and TFV 
when administered as F/TAF 25 mg. CBZ was allowed to reach steady-state and dosing was with food. 
Co-administration resulted in decreases in TAF AUCinf, AUClast and Cmax by approximately 54%, 55% 
and 57%, respectively, compared with administration of F/TAF FDC alone. A lesser decrease in TFV 
exposure was observed on co-administration such that AUCinf, AUClast and Cmax decreased by 
approximately 23%, 25%, and 30%, respectively.

GS-US-120-1538 evaluated co-administration of TAF 25 mg with oral (2.5 mg) and IV (1 mg) 
midazolam when dosed after standard breakfasts. TAF had no significant effect on plasma MDZ or 
1’OH-MDZ after oral or IV dosing. There was 25% to 30% decrease in TAF Cmax (25% to 30%) after 
co-administration with oral or IV MDZ, which the applicant proposed may reflect an effect of MDZ on 
gastrointestinal motility. TAF AUCs were also slightly lower but relatively less affected (~10-15% 
decreases).

(EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF) in Healthy Subjects 
GS-US-342-1167 evaluated co-administration of E/C/F/TAF 10 mg with Sofosbuvir and Velpatasvir 
(SOF/VPV 400 mg/100 mg tablets) for 8-day periods with dosing after a standard breakfast (~ 600 
kcal, 25-30% fat). Co-administration resulted in increases in SOF, GS-331007 and VPV exposures, 
which were all attributed to COBI. VPV inhibits P-gp but there was no effect of co-administration on 
TAF or TFV since COBI already effected maximal P-gp inhibition.

GS-US-366-1689 evaluated co-administration of F/R/TAF 25 mg with SOF and ledipasvir (LDV) 
[LDV/SOF 90/400 mg] when given once daily for 11 days under fed conditions. Co-administration led 
to increases in TAF and TFV AUCtau of 32% and 75%, respectively. TFV Cmax was increased by 62% 
and Ctau by 85% but there was no effect on TAF Cmax. Co-administration with FTC/RPV/TAF did not 
notably affect the PK of LDV or SOF (including its metabolites GS-566500 or GS-331007).

The applicant discussed that the increase in TFV exposures was consistent with the mechanistic 
understanding of the interaction between the P-gp inhibitor LDV and the P-gp substrate TAF. It was 
pointed out that the mean TFV AUCtau on co-administration (467 ng*hr/mL) is approximately 5 times 
lower than TFV exposure following dosing with TDF.

GS-US-292-1316 evaluated co-administration of E/C/F/TAF 10 mg at steady state with a single dose of 
sertraline [SER; 50 mg after completing a standardised breakfast (~600 kcal and 27% fat). Co-
administration had no clinically relevant effect on the PK of EVG, COBI, FTC, TAF, TFV or SER. 
Exposures to all analytes were consistent with historical data. All except two comparisons gave 90% CI 
that fell within 80, 125% and in the two exceptions (COBI Ctau and SER AUC0-∞) the lower boundary 
was only just below 80%.

which contains norgestimate (NGM; 0.180 mg/0.215 mg/0.250 mg) and ethinyl oestradiol (EE; 0.025 
mg) when each was given in the morning with food. Systemic exposures to NGMN (major metabolite of 
NGM), NG (minor metabolite of NGM) and EE were similar when the OC was given with and without 
F/TAF. The TAF and TFV exposures (given with food) were consistent with historical data. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
TFV-DP, the active metabolite of TAF, is an analogue of dATP that lacks a 3'-hydroxyl group. TFV-DP 
competes with dATP for incorporation into the nascent DNA chain during DNA polymerisation, resulting 
in premature termination of DNA synthesis. HBV replication involves reverse transcription and requires 
RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (RDDP), DNA-dependent DNA polymerase (DDDP) and ribonuclease H 
activities. HBV RT has been interchangeably designated as polymerase/reverse transcriptase (pol/RT), 
since it contains an additional N-terminal protein domain involved in protein-priming of viral DNA 
synthesis. 
The effect of TFV-DP on the DDDP activity of HBV pol/RT was evaluated in an enzymatic assay using 
recombinant HBV pol/RT expressed in and purified from baculovirus.

Figure 12.  Inhibition of HBV pol/RT DNA-Dependent DNA Polymerase Activity by TFV-DP 
dATP = deoxyadenosine triphosphate; TFV-DP = tenofovir diphoshate; V = velocity 
After incubation of HBV pol/RT with activated calf thymus DNA and dNTPs, inhibition of α-33P-labeled dATP incorporation was measured in the presence of 
indicated concentrations of TFV-DP. Data are presented as a Lineweaver-Burk plot. 
Polymerase activity of HBV pol/RT was inhibited by TFV-DP in a dose-dependent manner without a 
change in maximal upstroke velocity (Vmax). The Ki of DDDP inhibition by TFV-DP was determined to 
be 0.18 µM, which is 2.1 fold lower than the Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) of dATP (0.38 µM). 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Uptake of TAF into hepatocytes 
A study in wild-type and transfected CHO cells evaluated whether TAF is a substrate for OATP1B1 and 
1B3. TAF and control compounds were evaluated in the presence or absence of an inhibitor (40 μM 
rifampicin). TAF was taken up by wild-type CHO cells at a rate of 9.0 pmol/min/106 cells, indicating 
high passive permeability. The rate of TAF uptake increased by 30% and 168% in cells transfected 
with OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, respectively, vs. wild-type cells, but decreased by 48% and 76%, 
respectively, in the presence of rifampicin, demonstrating that TAF is a substrate for these 
transporters.  
AD-120-2042 was reported during the assessment of Genvoya. The study evaluated the effect of OATP 
inhibition by rifampicin on the uptake of TAF into primary human hepatocytes by measuring 
intracellular levels of TFV-DP. The OATP substrate bosentan was used as a positive control. Following 
pre-incubation of primary human hepatocytes from 4 donors (deceased males aged 44-55 years) with 
20 μM rifampicin for 30 min, cells were incubated with 0.5 μM TAF or bosentan for 2, 15 and 60 min 
and intracellular concentrations of TFV-DP or cell-associated bosentan levels were determined, 
respectively. A mean (of duplicate measurements) of 13% inhibition of TAF uptake by rifampicin was 
observed in hepatocytes from four different deceased donors (range from 4.8 to 34%) whereas the 
mean inhibition of accumulation of cell-associated levels of bosentan was approximately 38% (range 
33-46%). Donor 1 stood out as having higher TFV-DP concentrations compared to the others but this 
Assessment report

donor also showed very similar TFV-DP concentrations with and without pre-incubation with rifampicin. 
In contrast, donor 4 showed the highest bosentan levels in the absence of rifampicin with a large 
difference between runs but a marked reduction in both runs after pre-incubation with rifampicin. 
The validity of the study was questioned due to the results with the positive control. In a published 
DDI study there was a ~5-fold increase in bosentan trough concentrations after the first co-
administration of bosentan (125 mg BID) and rifampicin (600 mg QD). The applicant discussed that 
the in-vitro bosentan results likely underestimated the effect of rifampicin on bosentan uptake due to 
the inability to differentiate true intracellular concentrations from nonspecific association of the 
lipophilic pro-drug with the cell membrane. Non-specific binding would not affect the results with TAF 
because TFV-DP is only formed inside cells.  
It was concluded by the applicant that OATP1B1/3-mediated active transport makes a small 
contribution to TAF uptake into human hepatocytes in vitro. Therefore, although TAF is a substrate for 
OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, these results suggested that active uptake into hepatocytes via these 
transporters is not a major route. It should also be noted that these transporters are affected by 
genetic polymorphisms, which could also affect hepatic uptake of TAF regardless of co-administered 
medications.  
Intracellular metabolism of TAF 
After hepatocyte entry, the pro-drug carboxylester bond is cleaved by CES1 and/or CatA releasing an 
intermediate metabolite TFV-alanine, which is followed by hydrolysis to TFV and diphosphorylation by 
adenylate kinase and nucleoside diphosphate kinase to form the active moiety TFV-DP.  
The metabolism of TAF was compared with TDF and TFV in primary human hepatocytes by LC/MS/MS. 
The active moiety (TFV-DP) increased over 24 hours. Continuous incubation with 5 μM of TFV, TDF or 
TAF resulted in TFV-DP levels of 12.1, 302 and 1470 pmol/106 cells after 24 hours, respectively.  
In order to assess TFV-DP persistence in primary human hepatocytes, TAF loading was evaluated using 
a 2-hour pulse with 5 μM TAF followed by a washout with drug-free media for 22 hours. TFV-DP levels 
reached approximately 700 pmol/106 cells at 3 hours and decreased slightly over 24 hour.  
In a separate study that evaluated later time points in primary human hepatocytes following incubation 
with TFV, the t1/2 of TFV-DP of ~95 hours supported once daily dosing. These results correlated with 
inhibition of anti HBV activity for > 24 hours in HepG2 cells after a short incubation with TFV. 
In-vitro activity against wild-type clinical HBV isolates 
Full-length genomes or pol/RT regions were amplified from treatment-naive patients infected with 
genotypes A to H, cloned into expression vectors and transfected into HepG2 cells. After 7 days of 
treatment in the presence of TAF, HBV DNA intermediates were extracted and quantified by real-time 
PCR for determination of in-vitro susceptibility.  
The TAF EC50 values ranged from 34.7 to 134.4 nM, with an overall mean EC50 of 86.6 nM. TAF EC50 
values were compared with the control genotype A laboratory strain (pHY92). TAF had no observed 
cellular cytotoxicity up to the highest tested concentration (44400 nM). Based on these results, the 
selectivity (therapeutic) index (SI) for TAF was > 513 in HepG2 cells.

TDF activity against animal Hepadnavirus 
The woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) in its natural host, the eastern woodchuck Marmata monax, is a 
frequently used model of HBV infection. In this model oral TDF at 0.5, 1.5 and 5.0 mg/kg/day for 4 
weeks reduced serum viral load significantly, resulting in 0.2, 1.1 and 1.5 log10 decreases, 
respectively, from pretreatment levels. A 48-week study compared oral TDF, ADV, LAM and FTC as well 
as combinations of TDF or ADV with LAM and FTC at 15 mg/kg/day in the same model. After 12 weeks 
of TDF alone, LAM+TDF and FTC+TDF the mean serum viral load reductions were 3.6, 3.7 and 4.2 
log10 copies/mL, respectively. Between Weeks 12 and 24, varying degrees of viral rebound were 
observed across all drug treatment groups. At Week 48, the mean serum viral load reductions in the 
same three groups were 2.9, 5.8 and 6.1 log10 copies/mL, respectively. In the entire 48 week dosing 
period, there was no evidence of toxicity in woodchucks in any treatment group. 
In-vitro evaluation of HBV resistance 
Despite the advent of various model systems to characterise the HBV replication cycle, primary human 
hepatocytes retain susceptibility for infection for only a short time and hepatoma cell lines are not 
susceptible to infection due to lack of receptor expression. Therefore, in the absence of a robust tissue 
culture system that allows for sustained virus propagation, in-vitro resistance selection against TAF has 
not been conducted.  
In the TDF Phase 3 clinical studies (GS US 174 0102 and -0103) virologic analyses were performed to 
identify genotypic changes within HBV pol/RT from patients with detectable viral replication despite 
TDF treatment. See section 3.6 for further details of the data. 
After more than 8 years of resistance surveillance, genotypic or phenotypic resistance to TDF has not 
been documented in HBV-infected patients.

TAF activity against other Human and Animal viruses 
The antiviral activity of TAF and TFV was assessed against a panel of 18 animal viruses, including ≥ 1 
isolates of adenovirus, dengue type 2, influenza A, parainfluenza 3, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 
coxsackie B virus, rhinovirus, herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 (HSV-1), HSV type 2 (HSV-2), human 
cytomegalovirus (HCMV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), vaccinia virus, HCV, HIV-1, and simian 
immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Virus and cells were incubated in the presence of TAF or TFV for 2 to 
7 days, and then evaluated for antiviral activity (i.e. reduction of viral cytopathic effect, EC50) and 
cytotoxicity (CC 50). 
TAF inhibited HIV-1 and SIV with EC50 value ranges of 2.04 to 5.89 nM and 0.51 to 1.21 nM, 
respectively. No antiviral activity was observed against other human viruses except that TAF and TFV 
weakly inhibited both HSV-2 strains with EC50 ranges of 424 to 697 nM and 146 to 278 nM, 
respectively. In addition, TAF showed low activity against human parainfluenza with an EC50 of 843 
nM, which is likely attributable to cell growth inhibition observed at the highest tested concentration 
(1000 nM). Neither TAF nor TFV exhibited cytotoxicity up to the highest test concentrations of 1000 nM 
and 1000 μM, respectively.

Assess the Safety, Viral Kinetics, and Anti-HBV Activity of GS-7340 in Treatment-Naive Adults with 
Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB) Infection. 
This was an open-label study that compared TAF with TDF over 28 days in patients with CHB infection. 
Eligible patients had screening plasma HBV DNA ≥ 2 x103 IU/mL and documented CHB of at least 6 
months duration (e.g. by positive serum HBsAg) with ALT ≤ 10xULN and eGFRCG ≥ 70 mL/min. No 
prior anti-HBV nucleoside/nucleotide therapy was allowed but patients who had failed interferon 
treatment > 6 months prior to screening were eligible. Co-infection with HDV, HIV or HCV was not 
allowed. 
There were 51 patients randomised to TAF (8, 25, 40 or 120 mg) or TDF 300 mg orally once daily for 
28 days in the fasted state and 50 completed follow-up to 30 days post-therapy. Genotypes A to E 
were represented but there were only 1-5 per genotype per group. About half of the overall number 
was HBeAg+. The majority had acquired HBV via vertical transmission.

The median time-weighted average change from baseline through week 4 in serum HBV DNA ranged 
from −1.69 log10 IU/mL to −2.18 log10 IU/mL for TAF compared with −2.31 log10 IU/mL for TDF 300 
mg. 
The median changes from baseline in serum HBV DNA after 4 weeks of treatment were from -1.98 to -
2.76 log10 IU/mL vs. -2.60 log10 IU/mL for TDF 300 mg.  
Consistently smaller declines in HBV DNA and lower median change from baseline in HBV DNA at Day 
29 were observed in the TAF 40 mg group. The reason for this difference is stated to be unclear and 
was thought likely due to lower baseline HBV DNA values in comparison to the other TAF groups. In 
the TAF 40 mg group, the first quartile (Q1) at baseline (3.42 log10 IU/mL) was the smallest among all 
groups indicating more patients with lower baseline values were randomised into this group. The three 
lowest baseline values (< 3.5 log10 IU/mL) were also all in the TAF 40 mg group. The finding reflects 
the fact that 8/11 (72.7%) were HBeAg- in the 40 mg group. The mean HBV DNA change from 
baseline showed more comparable results for this group relative to the other TAF groups and TDF.

41-52.5 U/L in the TAF groups. Over 28 days of treatment, ALT levels changed minimally across 
treatment groups. At Day 29, median change from baseline in ALT was greatest for the TAF 25 mg 
group (−9.0 U/L).  
At baseline, the median quantitative HBsAg levels were similar across the treatment groups and there 
were no significant changes from baseline after 28 days of treatment.

Although allowed by protocol, the majority (all except 4) of patients did not receive oral anti-HBV 
therapy during the follow-up period. In those who did not receive further anti-HBV therapy median 
HBV DNA levels had returned toward baseline levels at the last follow-up in all treatment groups.

group as shown in Table 57. That is, plasma TFV was markedly lower even with TAF 120 mg compared 
with TDF.

PK-PD for efficacy  
In GS US 320 0101, taking into account the likely explanation for the results in the TAF 40 mg group, 
the applicant concluded that there was a lack of dose effect and no trends in exposure-response. 
Based on the efficacy and safety profile of TAF 25 mg in HIV-infected patients (or 10 mg with P-gp 
inhibitors) the 25 mg dose of TAF was selected for Phase 3 studies in HBV. 
The PK/PD relationship between TAF plasma exposure and efficacy (proportion with plasma HBV DNA < 
29 IU/mL at Week 48 using a missing = failure approach) was evaluated using data from the Phase 3 
studies (GS US 320 0108 and GS US 320 0110) and estimated TAF exposures (AUCtau and Cmax) 
derived from the POPPK analysis. In HBeAg-negative and HBeAg-positive patients there were no trends 
in exposure response relationship observed, consistent with the findings from the POPPK analyses that 
identified no clinically relevant covariates on TAF PK. In addition, no relationship was observed 
between quartiles of PK exposure and the maximum decrease from baseline in ALT. 
PK-PD for safety  
Analyses were performed between AUCtau and Cmax of TAF or TFV estimated from POPPK and 
selected safety endpoints using data from the Phase 3 studies. 
For diarrhoea, nausea and GI/abdominal pain, no exposure AE trends were observed. For vomiting, 
there was a trend towards a higher rate with higher TAF (but not TFV) exposure, which was discordant 
with the PK/PD analyses of the TAF exposure-safety relationship following administration of F/TAF in 
HIV-infected patients, which showed no trend in the presence of vomiting across a wide range of TAF 
exposures. No exposure effect relationships were noted for the percentage change in hip and spine 
BMD from baseline at Week 48. No exposure effect relationship was found for serum creatinine trends. 
The change in total cholesterol from baseline at Week 48 was comparable across TAF and TFV AUCtau 
quartiles. A lack of relationship was also observed between TAF and TFV exposure quartiles and change 
in fasted LDL, HDL and triglycerides from baseline at Week 48.

Secondary pharmacology 
GS-US-120-0107 – Study title: A Phase 1, Partially-Blinded, Randomized, Placebo- and Positive-
Controlled Study to Evaluate the Effect of GS-7340 on the QT/QTc Interval in Healthy Subjects 
GS-US-120-0107 was a TQT study. Single doses of 25 mg and 125 mg TAF were administered in a 
cross-over design so that healthy subjects received each of the following with 11-day washouts: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Treatment A: 25 mg TAF tablet plus 4 x placebo 
Treatment B: 125 mg TAF (5 x 25 mg TAF tablets) 
Treatment C:  5 x placebo 
Treatment D: 400 mg moxifloxacin 
Treatments A, B and C were administered double blind and moxifloxacin (D) was open label. All dosing 
was in the morning at ~08:00 with water and within 5 minutes of consuming a standard breakfast. 
There were 48 subjects (32 male) who completed all doses and were evaluable for the PK and PK-PD 
analyses. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters for TAF and TFV following single oral doses of 25 or 125 mg TAF were 
approximately proportional to dose.  
The lower bound of the 2-sided 90% CI for the mean difference between moxifloxacin and placebo was 
greater than 5 ms at 2 post-dose time points (3 and 4 h) establishing assay sensitivity. At these 
respective time points the actual changes were -1.4 and +4.1 ms for moxifloxacin compared to -12.9 
and -7.1 ms for placebo. For the primary analysis, TAF was concluded to have no QTcF prolongation 
effect as the upper bounds of the 2-sided 90% CIs for the mean difference between 25 mg and 125 
mg TAF and placebo were below 10 ms at each time point after dosing. Small negative changes in 
QTcF were observed at both doses. Analyses of secondary endpoints (QTcB, QTcN and QTcI) were 
consistent with the primary analysis. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
P-gp inhibition or induction 
TAF is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP. TAF uptake from the gut after oral administration is mainly 
determined by the presence or absence of co-administered inhibitors and inducers of P-gp.  
During review of the Genvoya (E/C/F/TAF) and Descovy (F/TAF) application dossiers it was agreed that 
10 mg TAF should be used when it is given with a strong inhibitor of P-gp. For Genvoya this is 
inevitable since cobicistat is in the FDC. For F/TAF the 10 mg TAF formulation was recommended when 
it is given with HIV PIs boosted with COBI or RTV. It was agreed that the use of F/TAF with any other 
strong inhibitor of P-gp should advise a reduction in dose so that the F/TAF 10 mg strength is used 
(e.g. this is advised when co-administering Descovy with ketoconazole, itraconazole and ciclosporin).   
However, when treating HBV a dose reduction to TAF 10 mg daily is not possible since there is only a 
25 mg tablet to be marketed. This same problem applied to F/R/TAF, for which only one strength 
tablet (containing 25 mg TAF) is marketed. Therefore the SmPC for TAF reflects the position reached 
on co-administration of F/R/TAF with inhibitors of P-gp such that co-administration with strong P-gp 
inhibitors is not recommended. In the F/R/TAF SmPC the agents not recommended on these grounds 
are triazole antifungals and ciclosporin. 
Assessment report  
EMA/793580/2016  
Page 95/156 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, it was agreed during the review of Descovy that use of F/TAF (10 or 25 mg) with inducers 
of P-gp should be not recommended. Co-administration with CYP3A inducers that are also P-gp 
inducers is contraindicated in the F/R/TAF SmPC due to RPV. However, for TAF alone a statement that 
co-administration with P-gp inducers is not recommended was considered to suffice.  
Co-infection with HIV 
There are no clinical data on the use of TAF 25 mg to treat HBV and simultaneously, in conjunction 
with other antiretroviral agents, to simultaneously treat HIV. Correspondingly, there are no data on the 
use of the various TAF-containing HIV FDCs to treat concurrent HBV infection. In reality, both potential 
uses of TAF-containing products should be successful and the safety profile should not be any different 
with respect to TAF per se. Therefore, the SmPC for the TAF 25 mg tablet in section 4.4 includes advice 
that in patients who are co-infected with HBV and HIV TAF should be co-administered with other 
antiretroviral agents to ensure that the patient receives an appropriate regimen for treatment of HIV. 
Effect of food 
It was previously established that food increases TAF absorption but the magnitude of effect is notable 
only when TAF is given without a strong P-gp inhibitor. The applicant has reported an additional food 
effect study (GS-US-320-1382) in which the TAF 25 mg tablet was given after a meal of 800 kcal and 
50% fat. The food effect in this study (AUC ~65% higher vs. fasted; AUClast 262 vs. 158 ng.h/mL) 
was consistent with the effect noted in the F/TAF study (AUC ~75% higher vs. fasted; AUClast 235 vs. 
134 ng.h/mL). During the review of Descovy a concern was raised regarding the adequacy of TAF 
absorption if the F/TAF 25 mg tablet was taken without food and without a P-gp inhibitor. However, 
after further review of plasma and intracellular levels in the HIV monotherapy and switch studies by 
third agent, it was finally agreed that for treatment of HIV Descovy may be taken with or without food. 
Based on the exposure-response observed in GS-US-320-0101 the applicant considered that the effect 
of food was not clinically relevant. In this study dosing was in the fasting state and the AUClast value 
for the 25 mg dose was 153 ng.h/mL. This mean value is similar to fasted state values in the two food 
effect studies mentioned above. Short-term viral suppression in the 25 mg group was at least as good 
as that achieved with 8, 40 mg and 120 mg doses and the 120 mg dose showed an advantage over 
lower doses only in a slower recovery of serum HBV DNA.  
However, in the Phase 3 HBV studies patients were instructed to take study drugs with food 
(unspecified meal content). The applicant reported that 5024/6051 plasma samples with measureable 
TAF concentrations were obtained after administration of TAF in the fed state. The POPPK estimate of 
the effect of fasting on TAF plasma levels (17.5% reduction in AUC for fasted vs. fed, which is a 21.2% 
increase in fed vs. fasted, with no change in Cmax) was less than that observed in GS US 320 1382, 
which showed that TAF AUCinf and AUClast were increased by 68% and 65%, respectively and Cmax 
was unchanged when administered with a high fat meal. Nevertheless, the applicant was unable to 
substantiate the reliability of information on whether TAF was taken with or without food on the 
sampling days in Phase 3 studies. Therefore the SmPC recommends that TAF 25 mg tablets should be 
taken with food. 
Uptake from plasma and onward metabolism 
TAF is a pro-drug with a short half-life in plasma. The mechanisms of uptake of TAF from plasma into 
hepatocytes and onward conversion to the active moiety TFV-DP are discussed further in the next 
section Although TAF is a substrate of OATP1B1/1B3, the in-vitro data suggest that active transport by 
OATP1B1/1B3 plays a minor role in its uptake into hepatocytes. A clinical interaction study with TAF 
and an inhibitor of OATP1B without effects on P-gp or BCRP has not been conducted to assess whether 
Assessment report  
EMA/793580/2016  
Page 96/156 
 
 
 
 
 
plasma levels could be higher only as a result of blocking hepatocyte uptake. In the Phase 3 studies 
co-administration with OATP1B inhibitors was not precluded but it seems that most recognised 
inhibitors would likely have potential to affect TAF levels due to effects on P-gp. Therefore a POPPK 
analysis that attempts to identify any possible effects of OATP1B inhibition on plasma TAF is unlikely to 
be fruitful. 
Carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) is proposed to be the predominant enzyme involved in the conversion of 
TAF to TFV in primary human hepatocytes, although CatA also makes a contribution. In support of this 
hypothesis, the anti-HBV EC50 of TAF in HepAD38 cells was not significantly affected by inhibition of 
CatA or CES1 alone. A marked effect was observed only when both CatA and CES1 were inhibited by 
telaprevir and BNPP, respectively; resulting in a significant reduction in TAF derived metabolites.   
The applicant describes CatA conversion as a high capacity and low affinity pathway not readily 
inhibited by other xenobiotics. In-vitro studies did not suggest significant inhibition of the conversion 
step by HIV protease inhibitors (known to inhibit CatA) but during review of the E/C/F/TAF dossier the 
applicant acknowledged that the HCV PIs telaprevir and boceprevir could have an effect intracellularly 
and the SmPC was amended such that co-administration with these agents is not recommended. There 
are also rare genetic polymorphisms resulting in low Cat A activity. However, since CES1 appears to be 
more important than CatA in hepatocytes, inhibition of CatA by telaprevir or boceprevir may not affect 
the conversion of TAF to TFV-DP in HepAD38 cells, which express both CatA and CES1. Therefore 
omission of the advice not to co-administer TAF with telaprevir or boceprevir is acceptable. In any case 
it is not at all likely that this will now occur due to the advent of DAA-only anti-HCV regimens.  
After conversion of TAF to TFV, TFV-DP is formed via intracellular phosphorylation exactly as happens 
after dosing with TDF. This hypothesis fits with the fact that in the metabolite profiling study <2% of 
an oral radioactive dose appeared in urine as intact TAF with none in faeces whereas TFV accounted for 
the majority of the radioactive dose recovered from urine and faeces.  
Although TAF accounted for most of the plasma radioactivity in the first few hours, most of the 
radioactivity in plasma (74%) was associated with uric acid over 96 h post-dose. After conversion to 
TFV it is proposed that metabolism proceeds via the purine catabolic pathway. This includes formation 
of uric acid. Since uric acid levels in pooled plasma increased over time and reached a maximum at 72 
h, TAF was undetectable by the 6-h time point, indicating that the depurination reaction proceeded 
even after TAF was depleted from plasma. The applicant considered that in theory complete inhibition 
of the depurination pathway could result in increase of plasma TFV levels up to 4-fold. Even under 
these conditions, the plasma TFV levels would be lower than those after administration of TDF (300 
mg). Since the depurination reaction is likely to occur after TAF is converted to TFV, induction of this 
pathway should not affect the TAF levels and, therefore, should not affect efficacy which is mainly 
delivered by intact TAF. On this basis the applicant concluded that clinically important DDIs associated 
with the depurination pathway are unlikely. 
However, allopurinol and febuxostat are xanthine oxidase inhibitors. This enzyme is responsible for the 
successive oxidation of hypoxanthine and xanthine, resulting in the production of uric acid. Therefore 
they decrease uric acid formation and may also inhibit purine synthesis. There is a need to understand 
the possible effects of allopurinol and febuxostat on TAF metabolism and whether TFV levels in plasma 
could increase, approaching those observed on dosing with TDF, with associated changes in the 
anticipated safety profile of TAF compared to TDF.  
Renal impairment 
Use of the HIV FDCs containing TAF is limited to persons with CrCL at least 30 mL/min due to the FTC 
content and inability to adjust the dose for those with lower renal function. In the additional study 
Assessment report  
EMA/793580/2016  
Page 97/156 
 
 
 
 
 
reported in the TAF dossier in subjects with CrCL between 15-29 mL/min the actual plasma TAF 
exposures were approximately double those observed in the matched controls, with mean plasma 
AUClast ~500 ng.h/mL and a CV% value of 47%. The proportion of TAF unbound was similar in the 
two groups. As expected, severe renal impairment had a much greater effect on plasma TFV such that 
after a 25 mg dose the mean plasma AUC (2070 ng.h/mL) was at the lower end of the range 
documented for TDF 300 mg doses in other studies.  
Since the actual plasma levels of TFV after a 25 mg TAF dose did not exceed the exposures that occur 
with the licensed dose (TDF 300 mg) in patients with normal renal function there is no reason to 
preclude use of TAF in patients with CrCL between 15-29 mL/min. Nevertheless, it should be expected 
that the safety profile of TAF 25 mg in this patient sub-group will resemble that of TDF. Therefore 
section 4.4 of the SmPC includes warnings about the risks of the expected TFV exposures.  
Use of TAF 25 mg in patients with CrCL < 15 mL/min who are on haemodialysis is based only on 
modelling and only on the predicted TFV exposures. 
In those on thrice weekly haemodialysis plasma TFV exposures are predicted to be in the range 
documented for dosing TDF 300 mg in patients with normal renal function. TAF 25 mg is not 
recommended for those with CrCL < 15 mL/min who are not on haemodialysis due to lack of data.  
Hepatic impairment 
In the Phase 3 HBV studies patients <15% had compensated cirrhosis and the remainder (large 
majority) was non-cirrhotic (based on Fibrotest scores). Due to the exclusion criteria (taking into 
account the clinical criteria excluding decompensation and the screening laboratory values), it is not at 
all likely that patients with HBV and CP-C scores have been treated.   
In a study in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment TAF and TFV plasma exposures were 
not markedly different vs. matched controls. In a separate study the TAF AUClast in subjects with 
severe hepatic impairment group was half that in the controls, with higher apparent volume of 
distribution in the terminal phase (Vz/F) and apparent total plasma clearance (CL/F). Correspondingly 
the plasma TFV in those with severe hepatic impairment was about 63% of that in matched controls, 
also with higher Vz/F and CL/F. The effect of severe hepatic impairment on plasma TAF cannot be 
explained by existing data on liver fibrosis since the POPPK model did not identify Fibrotest (FT) score 
as a predictor of PK (although few had scores ≥  0.75). The calculated free plasma TAF was 
comparable between those with severe hepatic impairment and their matched controls. However, 
similar plasma free TAF levels do not necessarily mean that uptake into hepatocytes is similar. Since 
there are no data on the efficacy of TAF in patients with CP-C (based on the patient selection criteria in 
Phase 3 studies) it is not possible to assume that there would be no difference in virological response 
between patients with normal hepatic function and those with severe impairment.  
Pharmacodynamics 
The intracellular conversion of TFV to the active moiety TFV-DP is the same regardless of whether 
dosing is with TDF or TAF. Hence the mechanism of action against HBV is also the same. The critical 
issue is to identify an appropriate dose of TAF for treatment of HBV since it cannot be assumed that a 
dose that is adequate for HIV is necessarily appropriate for HBV. For this application dossier, taking 
into account that: 
• 
• 
TDF is already shown to be efficacious for treatment of HBV when dosed at 300 mg once daily 
The in-vitro studies that can be conducted to assess activity of agents against HBV are more 
limited compared to what can be done to assess activity against HIV  
Assessment report  
EMA/793580/2016  
Page 98/156 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Subject to an adequate dose of TAF the risk of selecting for resistance and the potential for 
cross-resistance should be similar to that of TDF  
• 
• 
Intracellular TFV-DP cannot be assessed in hepatocytes from HBV-infected patients undergoing 
treatment without liver biopsy but in-vitro data suggested higher TFV-DP levels in hepatocytes 
after exposure to TAF compared to TFV or TDF 
The applicant’s claim that contribution of OATP1B to hepatocyte uptake of TAF is minimal is 
based only on in-vitro data from a study in which the control substance did not behave as 
expected  
The data reported by the applicant from the TAF dose effect study vs. TDF are very important for an 
expectation that an adequate dose of TAF should be able to achieve at least similar efficacy to TDF. 
Uptake of TAF into, and onward metabolism within, human hepatocytes was discussed in the previous 
section. The slight deviation from dose proportionality in TAF and TFV plasma levels observed in the 
negative TQT study for 25 vs. 125 mg TAF over the 5-fold range tested suggests that uptake of TAF 
into cells and conversion to TFV was not easily saturable.  
The initial study in CHO cells clearly demonstrated that TAF is a substrate of OATP1B1 and, especially, 
1B3. Due to the issues with the control (bosentan) in the in-vitro study (AD-120-2042), a definitive 
conclusion regarding the relative importance of OATP1B for TAF uptake into hepatocytes cannot be 
reached. In this study the effect of rifampicin on TAF uptake was at most 34% based on intracellular 
TFV-DP but ranged from 4.8 to 34% across the four donors. Since the SmPC states that use of TAF 25 
mg with strong inhibitors and inducers of P-gp is not recommended this will anyway cover use with 
several known agents that affect the activity of OATP1B.   
The applicant’s final choice of TAF 25 mg once daily for the HBV Phase 3 studies is supported by the 
short-term efficacy data (GS-US-320-0101). This was a small study (10 subjects per treatment group) 
with an uneven distribution of subjects according to HBeAg status, HBV genotype and baseline viral 
load (~5.5 to 6.5 log10 IU/mL). Supplementary figures provided, show the change from baseline for 
each subject in each dose group and demonstrate that all subjects in the study did have some decline 
from baseline, although of variable degree. The plot for the TAF 120 mg dose demonstrates that all 
subjects had more than 1 log10 drop during treatment. This was also observed for the TDF group but it 
was not a uniform finding for TAF doses lower than 120 mg. In addition, the follow-up data indicated 
that recovery of HBV DNA was delayed only in the TAF 120 mg dose group. 
This study actually suggested that 120 mg could be the most reliable dose of TAF across genotypes, 
viral loads and HBeAg status. The TAF 120 mg dose might even be somewhat more efficacious than 
TDF and was associated with TFV AUC substantially below that observed with TDF 300 mg; however, 
the TFV AUCs with 120 mg and 125 mg (QTc study) doses were 5-6-fold higher than observed with 
TAF 25 mg in each study. Therefore, selection of a TAF dose higher than 25 mg once daily, for which 
there is already substantial safety experience in HIV-infected patients, runs the risk of a safety profile 
(including renal and bone effects) that more resembles that of TDF.  
In such small groups and mixed disease characteristics it is not appropriate to analyse viral responses 
in even smaller sub-groups from this preliminary dose-finding study. More importantly, the PK-PD 
analyses derived from the Phase 3 studies did not demonstrate an exposure-response relationship 
based on POPPK-derived TAF AUCs in HBeAg-positive or -negative populations. These analyses do 
support a conclusion that doses higher than 25 mg would be unlikely to result in substantially higher 
virological response rates. 
Other observations 
Assessment report  
EMA/793580/2016  
Page 99/156 
 
 
 
 
 
The observation that plasma exposures to all analytes measured after dosing with Genvoya for several 
days was lower in Japanese vs. Caucasian subjects (for TAF the lower bound of the 90% CI was well 
below 80% for AUClast and for TFV the lower bounds of the 90% CI were well below 80% for AUCtau 
and Ctau) was never satisfactorily explained but for the purposes of treating HIV it was agreed that the 
differences should not impact on efficacy. These racial differences were not observed after a single 
dose. 
In a further study with a single dose of TAF 25 mg the TAF and TFV AUCs were slightly higher in the 
Japanese subjects, as were the mean and median CL/F values. It is unsatisfactory that this study was 
conducted with a single dose in light of the previous observations and lack of explanation for them. 
Nevertheless, the actual TAF and TFV AUCs that were observed after dosing Japanese subjects with 
Genvoya would be expected to apply to dosing HBV-infected Japanese subjects with TAF 25 mg. On 
this basis, taking into account the PK-PD analyses that have been conducted, if lower exposures were 
to occur in HBV-infected Japanese vs. non-Japanese subjects during daily dosing they would not be 
predicted to impact on efficacy. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
TAF is a prodrug with a distinct metabolic profile to TDF that results in > 90% lower circulating levels 
of TFV and > 4-fold higher intracellular levels of the active phosphorylated metabolite TFV-DP when 
TAF 25 mg is compared with TDF 300 mg. TAF is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP. TAF uptake from the 
gut after oral administration is mainly determined by the presence or absence of co-administered 
inhibitors and inducers of P-gp. Co-administration of TAF with P-gp inducers is not recommended. 
TAF should be administered with food. No dose adjustment of TAF is required in patients with hepatic 
impairment. No dose adjustment is required in adults or adolescents with estimated creatinine 
clearance (CrCl) ≥ 15 mL/min or in patients with CrCl < 15 mL/min receiving haemodialysis.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The two Phase 3 efficacy studies were as follows: 
GS-US-320-0108 
GS-US-320-0110 
A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy 
of Tenofovir Alafenamide (TAF) 25 mg QD versus Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate 
(TDF) 300 mg QD for the Treatment of HBeAg-Negative, Chronic Hepatitis B

of Tenofovir Alafenamide (TAF) 25 mg QD versus Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate 
(TDF) 300 mg QD for the Treatment of HBeAg-Positive, Chronic Hepatitis B 
These studies differed in study population (HBeAg status) but were otherwise of very similar design. 
The results are shown separately since, as expected, virological response rates were different. 
Methods 
Eligible patients were to meet the following criteria: 
•  HBeAg-negative CHB (0108) or HBeAg positive (0110) meeting both the following criteria at 
screening:

Evidence of HCC (e.g. by recent imaging) or hepatic decompensation (e.g. ascites, encephalopathy 
or variceal haemorrhage) 
•  Abnormal specified haematological and biochemical parameters 
•  Received solid organ or bone marrow transplant 
•  Significant organ or bone disease or multiple bone fractures 
•  Also excluded were patients on any of the following prohibited concomitant medications (if stopped 
at screening there was to be at least 30 days washout before study baseline): 
•  Nephrotoxic agents (e.g. aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, vancomycin, cidofovir, foscarnet, 
cisplatin, pentamidine, ciclosporin, tacrolimus) 
•

•  Systemic chemotherapeutic agents, systemic corticosteroids (except short-term prednisone), 
immunosuppressants or immunomodulating agents 
•  Bisphosphonates 
Both studies were double-blind and double-dummy in design. Patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio 
to:

TDF group: TDF 300 mg once daily and matched placebo of TAF 25 mg once daily for 96 weeks  
It was recommended but not mandated that study drugs were taken in the morning at approximately 
the same time each day and dosing was to be with food. 
Patients who lost HBsAg and seroconverted to anti-HBs were to discontinue study drugs within 3 to 6 
months or after Week 48 if seroconversion occurred prior to this visit.

the non-inferiority margin of 10% at a 1-sided significance level of 0.025. This sample size was based 
on the assumption that the difference (TAF-TDF) in proportions with HBV DNA < 29 IU/mL was 0 and 
the proportion with HBV DNA < 29 IU/mL in the TDF group was 91% (derived from the TDF study GS-
US-174-0102). Randomisation was stratified by plasma HBV DNA level (< 7 log 10 IU/mL, ≥ 7 to < 8 
log 10 IU/mL, ≥ 8 log 10 IU/mL) and OAV treatment status.  
In 0110: Sample sizes of 288 TDF and 576 TAF patients were planned to give 84% power to rule out 
the non-inferiority margin of 10% at a 1-sided significance level of 0.025. This sample size was based 
on the assumption that the difference (TAF-TDF) in the proportions with HBV DNA < 29 IU/mL was 0 
and the proportion with HBV DNA < 29 IU/mL in the TDF group was 69% (derived from the TDF study 
GS-US-174-0103). Randomisation was stratified by plasma HBV DNA level (≥ 8 or < 8 log 10 IU/mL) 
and OAV treatment status. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects with HBV DNA < 29 IU/mL at Week 48 
and the primary efficacy analysis was conducted after the last randomised patient reached Week 48 or 
discontinued study drugs prematurely. An M = F approach was employed. The baseline stratum-
weighted difference in the proportion (P1 – P2) and its 95% CI was calculated based on stratum-
adjusted Mantel-Haenszel (MH) proportion, where stratification factors included baseline HBV DNA and 
OAV status.

a For screen successes but not randomized, 14 were due to withdrawal of consent and 4 were due to outside of visit window. 
Data cut-off date was 01 October 2015. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar between the treatment groups except that 
patients in the TAF group were slightly younger with median age 46 years (range: 19 to 80) vs. 50 
years (range: 25 to 72) in the TDF group. The majority was male (60.9%) and Asian (72.0%), 25% 
were white and 8 subjects were Black. 
Regarding baseline disease characteristics (see below) only 11.1% TAF and 14.4% TDF patients had a 
baseline FibroTest score > 0.75. The baseline HBV DNA ranges show that not all patients met the 
inclusion criterion applied at screening for minimum ≥ 2 × 104 IU/mL. Similarly, the baseline ALT 
ranges show that not all patients met the inclusion criterion applied at screening for minimum ALT >60 
U/L (although 82.8% TAF and 86.4% TDF had values > ULN) and some exceeded 10 x ULN.

At Week 48, the rates of HBV DNA ≤ 29 IU/mL for subgroups did not differ statistically between TAF 
and TDF groups (see below). Those with baseline HBV DNA ≥ 7 log 10 IU/mL had a higher rate of HBV 
DNA < 29 IU/mL at Week 48 in the TDF group compared with the TAF group. Additional analyses 
performed by baseline HBV DNA level (< 7, ≥ 7 or ≥ 8 log 10 IU/mL; M = F analysis) did not 
demonstrate significant differences at the highest HBV DNA level. In the subgroup with HBV DNA ≥ 8 
log 10 IU/mL at baseline, 76.9% (10/13) in the TAF group and 75% (3/4) in the TDF group achieved 
HBV DNA <29 IU/mL at Week 48 (p = 0.67).

Possible imbalances between the TAF and TDF groups for subjects enrolled in the European and North 
American regions were explored using four identified risk factors for treatment failure. The imbalances 
in demographics and disease characteristics do not seem to explain the differences in virologic 
outcomes at Week 48 between TAF and TDF in these regions.

No patient experienced HBsAg loss by Week 48. There were very small and similar decreases in mean 
HBsAg level in the two treatment groups at Weeks 12, 24 and 48. 
At Week 48, the mean (SD) change in ALT from the baseline value was −66.8 [90.58] U/L in the TAF 
group and −62.4 [84.85] U/L in the TDF group (p = 0.68). Using the central laboratory criteria, the 
percentage with normalised ALT was numerically higher for the TAF group from Weeks 4 through 48. 
At Week 48, rates of ALT normalisation were similar between treatment groups by the M = F method 
for the FAS. Using the AASLD criteria (≤ 30 U/L for men and ≤ 19 U/L for women) the percentage with 
normalised ALT was significantly higher in the TAF group from Week 8 onward using the M = F 
method.

were HBeAg positive at screening but were negative at baseline and 14 of the 18 were HBeAg negative 
at all subsequent visits. These 18 were excluded from the analysis of HBeAg loss/seroconversion but 
were included in the FAS. Other baseline data indicate that not all patients still met the eligibility 
criteria applied at screening for ALT but the minimum for HBV DNA appears to have been met. At 
baseline 8% TAF and 7.8% TDF patients had FibroTest scores > 0.75.

Details of failures across studies 0108 and 0110 
Of the 1298 patients in FAS across Phase 3 studies, 282 (TAF 190; TDF 92) had HBV DNA ≥ 29 IU/mL 
at Week 48. Of the 282 patients, 30 (TAF 17; TDF 13) had virologic breakthrough (29 at Week 48 and 
one at early discontinuation at Week 24). Univariate analysis identified higher HBV DNA level 
(≥ 8 log 10 IU/mL), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive status, prior OAV, decreased FibroTest (FT) 
score and HBV genotype D as being predictive of virologic failure. Multivariate analysis demonstrated 
that the 6 factors most significantly associated with virologic failure (p < 0.001) were baseline 
HBV DNA ≥ 8 log 10 IU/mL, baseline HBeAg seropositivity, baseline BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2, prior treatment 
experience, HBV genotype D and baseline ALT ≤ 5 × ULN by AASLD criteria. Treatment with TAF 25 mg 
was not identified as an independent predictor of virologic failure.

Week 48 
In both the TAF and TDF groups, rates of virologic failure increased in the presence of more risk 
factors, most markedly in the subgroup with 4 or more risk factors. Although the presence of multiple 
predictors of virologic failure reduces the likelihood of achieving virologic suppression consistently to a 
larger extent for TAF, the difference between the treatments is small and does not suggest a relevant 
difference in efficacy in the subgroups. 
Update of efficacy to Week 72  
Across both studies 70.2% patients remained on double-blind study drug treatment and 22.5% had 
completed double-blind study drug treatment through the Week 72 data-cut date. A total of 32 
subjects had discontinued double-blinded study drug between the Week 48 and 72 data cut-off dates. 
The 32 comprised 2 TAF and 4 TDF subjects in 0108 and 17 TAF and 9 TDF subjects in 0110.  
There were no differences between treatments in reasons to discontinue. Similar rates of HBV DNA 
suppression were achieved in the TAF and TDF groups when assessed using the M = F method at 
Week 72.

In both studies, the kinetics of HBV DNA decline as assessed by the proportion of subjects with HBV 
DNA < 29 IU/mL over 72 weeks were similar between treatment groups. 
In GS-US-320-0108, a slightly lower percentage had HBV DNA levels < 29 IU/mL in both treatment 
groups at Week 72 compared with Week 48. This decrease reflected a higher number (difference = 8) 
with no virologic data at Week 72 due to premature discontinuation of study drug compared with Week 
48. However, in GS-US-320-0110, a higher percentage had HBV DNA levels < 29 IU/mL in both 
treatment groups at Week 72 compared with Week 48, indicating that some HBeAg positive subjects 
required longer treatment to achieve virologic suppression. At Week 72 using the M=E method the 
percentages with ≤ 29 IU/mL were 76.1% in the TAF and 78.1% in the TDF group (difference [baseline 
stratum-adjusted] −2.8% [95% CI: −8.6% to 3.1%], p = 0.35). The mean change from baseline in 
HBV DNA at Week 72 was not significantly different between the TAF and TDF groups in either study.  
Proportions with ALT normalisation at Weeks 48 and 72 using the central laboratory criteria and the 
AASLD criteria continued to show advantages for TAF over TDF as shown below.

included. Central laboratory ULN for ALT are as follows: ≤ 43 U/L for males 18 to < 69 years and ≤ 35 U/L for males ≥ 69 years; ≤ 34 U/L for females 18 
to < 69 years and ≤ 32 U/L for females ≥ 69 years. 
b P-value was from the CMH tests stratified by baseline HBV DNA categories and OAV treatment status strata. 
c Difference in the proportion between treatment groups and its 95% CI were calculated based on the MH proportions adjusted by baseline HBV DNA 
categories and OAV treatment status strata. 
d For the analysis of ALT normalization using the AASLD criteria, only subjects with ALT > ULN of the AASLD criteria (> 30 U/L males and > 19 U/L 
females) at baseline were included [Lok et al 2009], [Terrault et al 2015]. 
Serology was not analysed at Week 72 but the serology results from Week 64 are reported.  
In GS-US-320-0108, one TAF subject (0.4%) experienced HBsAg loss at Week 64 without 
seroconversion. This 44 year-old Asian female with genotype A CHB had HBsAg seroconversion at 
Week 80. 
In GS-US-320-0110, two TAF subjects had HBsAg loss between Weeks 48 and 64 so that 6/576 
(1.0%) TAF and 3/288 (1.0%) TDF subjects had HBsAg loss at Week 64 (M = F analysis).  
HBsAg seroconversion was achieved by 2 TAF subjects between Weeks 48 and 64 to give overall rates 
from baseline of 5 (0.9%) in the TAF group and 0 in the TDF group (M = F analysis).  
At Week 64, 90/565 (15.9%) in the TAF group and 42/285 (14.7%) in the TDF group experienced 
HBeAg loss (M = F analysis; p = 0.68). 
HBeAg seroconversion was achieved in 71/565 (12.6%) in the TAF group and 28/285 (9.8%) in the 
TDF group (M = F analysis; p = 0.25).

Baseline virology analyses 
The HBV genotype distribution was comparable between treatment groups, with genotype C 
predominant in both groups (47.5% overall, 617/1298; see below). Proportions with < 29 IU/mL at 
Week 48 was analysed for genotypes A-D, there being too few or no patients with other genotypes. In 
the TAF group the proportion with < 29 IU/mL at Week 48 was significantly lower for genotype D vs. 
genotypes A-C. The rate in genotype D patients treated with TAF was also significantly lower than the 
rates for patients with genotypes B and C in the TDF group.

Most (89.2%) HBV at baseline were classified as wild type (TAF: 89.5% wild type, 10.5% mutant; 
TDF: 88.7% wild type, 11.3% mutant). A higher percentage of HBV in the OAV-naive (92.4%) were 
classified as wild type vs. OAV-experienced (78.4%). The remaining 10.8% (140/1298) were found to 
have mutations in pol/RT, with a higher rate for the OAV-experienced (21.6% vs. 7.6%).

Primary resistance mutations were observed in 5.4% (70/1298), with a higher percentage in the

The other 70 (5.4%) had other mutations, with similar percentages for OAV-naive and OAV-
experienced (5.7% vs. 4.4%).  
The distributions of primary and other resistance mutations were similar between treatment groups 
(TAF: 4.7% primary and 5.8% other mutations; TDF: 6.7% primary and 4.6% other mutations).

The impact of baseline resistance mutations as determined by INNO-LiPA on proportions achieving HBV 
DNA < 29 IU/mL at Week 48 was assessed for all patients. No significant differences were observed in

In both treatment groups, those with primary resistance mutations were less likely to achieve HBV 
DNA < 29 IU/mL (TAF 46.3% vs. TDF 62.1%). The lower rate of HBV DNA suppression at Week 48 in 
those with baseline primary resistance mutations was not associated with increased rates of virologic 
breakthrough. The applicant proposed that the lower proportion with primary resistance mutations 
achieving HBV DNA < 29 IU/mL in the TAF treatment group may reflect in some part the higher 
proportion with early discontinuation or missing data vs. the TDF group.

Overall, no HBV pol/RT amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to TFV were detected 
through 48 weeks of the study in either treatment group. 
Of the 38 reported above who qualified for population sequencing analysis through Week 48, 
8 (0.9%) from the TAF group and 8 (1.9%) from the TDF group qualified for deep sequencing 
analyses. One ADV resistance-associated substitution was detected in one TDF patient (rtN236T) and 
two polymorphic substitutions in pol/RT were detected in two patients each (rtN123D in one TAF and 
one TDF patient and rtH124D in two TAF patients). All of the patients with these substitutions who 
remained on study through Week 48 achieved HBV DNA < 69 IU/mL with continued treatment. 
Thus, no substitutions associated with sustained virologic breakthrough were identified through 
48 weeks of this study. Nine of the 38 patients (TAF and 4 TDF) qualified for phenotypic analysis. No 
patient in the TAF or TDF group had HBV with reduced susceptibility to TAF or tenofovir, respectively, 
through Week 48.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Assay of HBV DNA 
The applicant selected the Roche COBAS Taqman HBV test for use with the high pure System (LLOQ 29 
IU/mL and LOD 10 IU/mL. The use of this assay is acceptable and it allows for expression of results in 
International Units. 
Comparison of TAF with TDF  
The comparison with TDF in both Phase 3 studies is acceptable taking into account the aim to provide a 
direct comparison between TAF and TDF for safety and efficacy. The applicant also justified the use of 
TDF as the comparator based on the fact that in the prior TDF Phase 3 studies the primary endpoint 
was a composite of HBV DNA suppression and histological improvement demonstrated in a repeat liver 
biopsy. Since then it has become unfeasible to demand that patients are enrolled only if they meet 
specific histological criteria applied to liver biopsies and it is no longer routine to monitor progress on 
treatment with repeat biopsies. Therefore a primary endpoint based on suppression of HBV DNA below 
the LLOQ using the same assay as applied in the prior TDF Phase 3 studies was considered appropriate 
and supportive of assumptions that virological responses would be accompanied by some beneficial 
changes in histology if this had been assessed. 
Primary endpoint and non-inferiority margin 
The assumptions made regarding the anticipated HBV DNA suppression rates for TDF in HBeAg-positive 
and -negative populations were based on the prior TDF Phase 3 studies in which TDF was compared 
with adefovir. A brief consideration of prior development programmes seems appropriate. 
Adefovir was compared to placebo in HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative populations. Significantly 
more patients treated with adefovir vs. placebo in each sub-population (53% vs. 25% and 64% vs. 
33%) had histological improvement from baseline at week 48 (≥ 2 points in the Knodell necro-
inflammatory score with no concurrent worsening in the Knodell fibrosis score). Baseline ALT ≥  2 x 
ULN, Knodell HAI ≥  10 and HBV DNA < 7.6 log10 copies/mL were associated with greater histological 
improvement. Adefovir was associated with significant reductions in serum HBV DNA (3.52 and 3.91 
log10 copies/mL, respectively, vs. 0.55 and 1.35 log10 copies/mL), increased rate of normalisation of 
ALT (48 and 72% vs. 16 and 29%) and higher rate of HBV DNA < 400 copies/mL (Roche Amplicor 
Assessment report  
EMA/793580/2016 
Page 128/156 
  
  
 
 
  
Monitor PCR assay; 21 and 51% vs. 0%). HBeAg seroconversion (12 %) and HBeAg loss (24%) was 
observed significantly more frequently with adefovir (vs. 6 % and 11 %, respectively, for placebo) 
after 48 weeks of treatment. 
In the subsequent TDF Phase 3 studies TDF was significantly superior to adefovir for the primary 
efficacy endpoint of complete response (HBV DNA < 400 copies/mL and Knodell necroinflammatory 
score improvement ≥ 2 points without worsening in Knodell fibrosis). The rates were 71% vs. 49% in 
the HBeAg negative and 67% vs. 12% in the HBeAg positive populations. Rates for < 169 c/mL [<29 
IU/mL] were 91% and 69% for TDF vs. 56% and 9% for adefovir in respective populations. Also, in 
the HBeAg positive study a significantly greater proportion of TDF patients had normalised ALT and 
achieved HBsAg loss at week 48. 
According to Marcellin et al. (2008) more than half of the patients in the two Phase 3 TDF studies were 
Caucasian while one quarter to one third were Asian. The HBeAg positive population was slightly 
younger than the HBeAg negative population, with mean ages 34 vs. 44 years. Mean baseline HBV 
DNA was > 8 log10 c/mL in the HBeAg positive and > 6 log10 c/mL in the HBeAg negative study, 
mean baseline ALT was in the range 120-160 IU/mL, genotypes D and C predominated and 20% per 
study had cirrhosis. There were some differences in factors potentially impacting on outcomes 
compared with the populations enrolled into the TAF Phase 3 studies. Nevertheless, as discussed 
below, the virologic response rates in the TDF groups in the TAF Phase 3 studies closely resembled 
those in the prior TDF Phase 3 studies. 
Although TDF was not directly compared with entecavir, the effects of TDF on HBV DNA are in keeping 
with those for entecavir when compared with lamivudine (LAM) in LAM-naïve patients. Percentages 
with < 300 c/mL at Week 48 were 90% and 67% in HBeAg-negative and -positive populations 
compared with 72% and 36%, respectively, for LAM. 
Overall, the primary efficacy endpoint as determined at Week 48 in the TAF Phase 3 studies is 
acceptable. The non-inferiority margin causes no concern regarding differentiating the effect of TAF 
from placebo. The 10% margin could be questioned when comparing active treatments, especially 
since the same margin was applied for the HBeAg-positive and -negative populations even though 
higher rates of virologic response were anticipated and achieved in the latter. The fact that the margin 
was barely met in the former group but easily met in the latter population is discussed below. 
Virologic failures 
In GS-US-320-0108 in the primary analysis 27 patients (17 TAF) did not have < 29 IU/mL HBV DNA at 
Week 48. Of these, 7 TAF and 4 TDF patients were known to have ≥ 29 IU/mL HBV DNA at week 48 
while 10 TAF and 6 TDF patients did not have a value that could be used in the analysis. Three patients 
had virologic breakthrough through Week 48 (2 TAF) while 4 patients (all TAF) were persistently 
viraemic.  
In GS US 320 0110 in the primary analysis 210 TAF and 97 TDF patients (total 307) had < 29 IU/mL 
at Week 48. Of the rest, 183 TAF and 88 TDF patients were known to have ≥ 29 IU/mL HBV DNA at 
Week 48 while 27 and 9 in respective groups had no value for the analysis. Virologic breakthrough 
through Week 48 occurred in 14 TAF patients (5/14 had baseline HBV DNA < 8 log10 IU/mL) and in 12 
TDF patients (6 with < and 6 with ≥ 8 log10 IU/mL). Persistent viraemia was confirmed at Week 48 for 
114 TAF (19.6%) and 53 TDF (18.2%) patients. 
In summary, the data from the Virology Report demonstrate that the majority of patients who did not 
have < 29 IU/mL HBV DNA at Week 48 could be classified as primary virologic failures. The relatively 
low proportion with virologic breakthrough is in keeping with the results of the Phase 3 TDF studies in 
which only 10/426 TDF patients (10/39 with > 400 c/mL) met the definition of breakthrough. 
Assessment report  
EMA/793580/2016 
Page 129/156 
  
  
 
Univariate and multivariate analyses did not identify treatment (i.e. TAF vs. TDF) as a predictor of 
failure. The analysis of outcome according to number of risk factors for failure (multivariate analysis) 
showed that ≥4 factors in an individual patient had an important effect on outcome regardless of the 
treatment.  
In patients without virologic breakthrough who remained viraemic (HBV DNA ≥ 29 IU/mL) after 48 
weeks of treatment, a longer duration of treatment may be required to achieve complete suppression, 
particularly those with high HBV DNA levels at baseline. 
At Week 72, both the TAF and TDF groups in GS US 320 0110 demonstrated increased rates of HBV 
DNA suppression vs. Week 48 (at Week 72 rates were GS US 320 0108: TAF 92.6%, TDF 92.1%; GS 
US 320 0110: TAF 71.6%, TDF 71.9%). Given the clinically significant viral declines in those with 
primary virologic failure, the increased rates of HBV DNA suppression at Week 72 and the lack of 
resistance among patients with viral breakthrough, switching to another agent just because viral 
suppression has not been achieved at Week 48 does not appear to be warranted. 
General considerations on study populations 
Although both studies required that eligible patients at screening should have HBV DNA ≥2 x 104 
IU/mL and serum ALT > 60 U/L (males) or > 38 U/L (females) and ≤ 10 x ULN (central laboratory 
range) the baseline data show that some patients did not meet these same criteria by the time they 
were enrolled. Further analyses showed similar outcomes for those who fell outside of these criteria at 
baseline compared to the total study population. 
Prior (> 12 weeks) previous OAV with any nucleoside or nucleotide analogue was reported for ~21% in 
0108 and ~26% in 0110. Only in the latter study was there a negative impact of prior treatment on 
virologic response. It is not known whether pre-treated patients had pre-study primary failure or 
rebound since the data were not collected. To explore the lower response rates in treatment 
experienced patients, multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed. No baseline factor 
appeared clearly responsible for the difference. When treatment experienced was defined as 
 1 2  
weeks prior treatment with any individual OAV (grouping those who took ADV, CLE, TBV and other 
OAV into “Other Agents” due to small numbers) similar response rates were observed between the TAF 
and TDF groups for those pre-treated with ETV and LAM. Responses rates were lower for those who 
had taken TDF. At present there is no clear explanation for the lower response rates in pre-treated 
HBeAg positive patients. 
As discussed under Pharmacokinetics, there are no data on use of TAF to treat HBV in patients co-
infected with HIV or HCV. Patients with hepatitis D virus (HDV) were excluded from the Phase 3 
studies. The lack of data is stated in the SmPC. 
Patients were not classified or excluded at baseline according to their Child-Pugh scores. However, 
patients with a history or current evidence of hepatic decompensation (e.g. ascites, encephalopathy or 
variceal haemorrhage) were excluded. In addition, there were exclusions based on haematology and 
chemistry laboratory results. As discussed under Pharmacokinetics, it is not at all likely that patients 
with severe hepatic impairment were enrolled. The SmPC reflects the lack of data in this subset. 
Based on FibroTest scores a low percentage of patients in the TAF Phase 3 studies had cirrhosis. In 
study 0108 viral suppression rates in those with FibroTest scores ≥0.75 were 27/31 (87%) for TAF and 
19/20 (95%) for TDF. The corresponding rates in study 0110 were 31/45 (69%) vs. 17/22 (77%). 
Therefore, although numbers were small, there was consistent numerical inferiority for TAF. Further 
analyses showed that treatment responses were high in both treatment groups and consistent across 
FT categories < 0.49 and ≥ 0.49 to < 0.75 in study 01018. A lower response was observed in the TAF 
group compared with the TDF group by M = F analysis for those with baseline FT scores ≥ 0.75 but 
this may reflect the higher percentage in the TAF group that discontinued treatment early for “other

reasons” (i.e. withdrew consent, lost to follow up). In 0110, treatment responses were higher in the   
0.75 category compared with < 0.49, indicating no impact of cirrhosis on viral suppression by either 
TAF or TDF. 
The baseline demographic and disease characteristics of those with FT scores 
did not fail treatment (HBV DNA ≥  29 IU/mL or < 29 IU/mL at Week 48) showed that those who failed 
 0 . 7 5  a n d  w
treatment were older and more likely to have co-morbidities (diabetes, hypertension and 
hyperlipidemia). Although the sample size was small, those assumed to have cirrhosis who failed 
treatment were more likely to have HBV DNA ≥ 8 log10 IU/mL, ALT ≤ 5 x ULN, to be HBeAg positive, 
to have HBV genotype D and to be treatment experienced compared with those who did not fail 
treatment. Overall, the findings were consistent with factors predictive of treatment failure in the 
overall study population. 
Efficacy in the HBeAg-negative population in study 0108 
TAF was non-inferior to TDF based on the proportions with HBV DNA < 29 IU/mL at Week 48, with a 
lower bound of the 95% CI around the difference that was -3.6%. There were 10 TAF and 5 TDF FAS 
patients without a viral load value at Week 48, indicating that there was no obvious bias in favour of 
either treatment. Results in the PP population supported the FAS results. Additionally, numerically 
higher percentages in the TAF group with < 29 IU/mL had undetectable HBV DNA. On this basis, 
regardless of any concern there could be regarding a 10% margin (which was not pre-agreed with 
CHMP) TAF was similarly efficacious to TDF based on proportions with < 29 IU/mL at Week 48.  
Week 48 rates of HBV DNA < 29 IU/mL by major sub-group showed that in those with baseline HBV 
DNA ≥ 7 log10 IU/mL there was a numerically higher rate of viral suppression in the TDF group (47/55 
[85.5%) vs. 23/24 [95.8%]). However, 5/55 TAF and 0/24 TDF patients had undetectable HBV DNA at 
Week 48.  
Additional analyses performed by baseline HBV DNA level (< 7 log10 IU/mL; ≥ 7 log10 IU/mL; and ≥ 8 
log10 IU/mL; M = F) did not demonstrate significant differences in HBV suppression at the highest HBV 
DNA level. In fact there were only 13 TAF and 4 TDF patients with ≥ 8 log10 IU/mL of which 10/13 
(77%) and 3/4 (75%) had < 29 IU/mL at Week 48.  
A numerically higher proportion in the TAF group achieved ALT normalisation by central laboratory 
criteria over 48 weeks with a significant difference obtained based on the AASLD criteria. Both curves 
showed an early divergence between treatments in effects on ALT. It should be noted that mean 
baseline ALT tended to be lower in the TAF studies compared to the prior TDF studies.  
Efficacy in the HBeAg-positive population in study 0110 
TAF was concluded to be non-inferior to TDF based on the pre-defined non-inferiority margin applied to 
the 95% CI around the difference in proportions with plasma HBV DNA < 29 IU/mL at Week 48. The 
actual lower bound was very near to the pre-defined limit (-9.8%) with a numerical difference of TAF 
63.9% vs. TDF 66.8%. Relatively few patients in this study had < 29 IU/mL and undetectable HBV 
DNA at Week 48 but there was no difference between treatments in this respect. 
The applicant points to the difference in percentages with no Week 48 value, affecting 27 TAF (one of 
whom discontinued due to lack of efficacy) and 9 TDF patients, i.e. a 3:1 ratio compared to the 2:1 
randomisation ratio. However, in the PP analysis non-inferiority was also only just about shown (TAF 
66.9% vs. TDF 69.0%; diff -2.6%, 95% CI: −8.9% to 3.6%). An additional analysis excluding 14 
patients who lost HBeAg between screening and randomisation and stayed negative throughout the 
study gave response rates of TAF 63.3% vs. TDF 66.4% (difference -3.6%, 95% CI: −9.9%, 2.7%).  
There were no statistical differences in proportions with HBV DNA < 29 IU/mL across the major 
subgroups but the comparisons almost uniformly favoured TDF, the exceptions being patients aged

over 50 years and those enrolled in Europe. Despite the apparent difference between treatments for 
effects on HBV DNA, a higher proportion in the TAF group achieved ALT normalisation by central and 
AASLD laboratory criteria with a significant difference vs. TDF for the latter. As in 0108, the curves 
show an early divergence in ALT by treatment. There was also no disadvantage for TAF in terms of 
numbers with HBsAg loss, HBeAg loss or HBeAg loss with seroconversion (10.3% vs. 8.1%).  
Responses by HBV genotype 
There were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in viral suppression rates 
for the commonest genotypes (A-D). TAF was numerically better for genotype A and numerically worse 
for genotype B, with very similar viral suppression rates for C and D. TAF and TDF achieved the lowest 
rates for genotype D, which accounted for about 30% in 0108 and 20% in 0110. As reported above, 
the multivariate analyses identified genotype D as a significant factor associated with virologic failure. 
Responses by baseline mutations  
All patients were assessed for the presence of pre-existing resistance mutations in pol/RT at baseline 
using the HBV INNO-LiPA Multi-DR v2/v3 hybridization assay. Not surprisingly a higher percentage of 
HBV in the OAV-naive (92.4%) were classified as wild type vs. OAV-experienced (78.4%). Primary 
resistance mutations occurred in 17.2% OAV experienced vs. 1.9% of the OAV naïve, the commonest 
being associated with resistance to LAM. For each resistance category, no significant differences were 
observed in the proportions with HBV DNA < 29 IU/mL in the TAF vs. TDF group at Week 48. However, 
in the subset with primary resistance mutations 19/41 (46%) TAF and 18/29 (62%) TDF patients had 
<29 IU/mL at Week 48. It appeared that the difference was driven by primary virologic failure and not 
breakthrough. 
Development of new mutations 
The number of patients qualifying for population sequencing of Week 48 samples was 24 in the TAF 
group (2.8%) and 14 in the TDF group (3.2%). In the TAF group 15/24 had no changes detected in 
the pol/RT sequence from baseline, 4 were unable to be sequenced and 5 had polymorphic site 
substitutions.  
In the TDF group 6/14 had no changes detected in the pol/RT sequence from baseline, 4 were unable 
to be sequenced, 2 had polymorphic site substitutions and 2 had conserved site substitutions. No HBV 
pol/RT amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to TFV were detected through 48 weeks of 
the study in either treatment group. Additional limited data were reported from deep sequencing and 
phenotypic analyses that raise no new concerns. The studies will now continue to Week 384, providing 
useful information on long-term exposure and emergence of resistance. 
Further data from 0108 and 0110 
Data to Week 72 were provided and did not raise new concerns. The data from study 0110 
demonstrated that some HBeAg positive patients needed very long exposures to achieve virologic 
suppression. The applicant has extended both studies and committed to provide the Clinical Study 
Reports (CSRs) at timed intervals (Week 96, 144, and 384 data-cuts). 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The applicant conducted two studies in a population characterised by HBeAg status and having HBV 
DNA ≥ 2 x 104 IU/mL (i.e. ≥ 20,000 IU/mL) and serum ALT > 60 U/L (males) or > 38 U/L (females) 
and ≤ 10 x ULN. According to EASL, HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients with ALT > 2 x ULN 
(AASLD defines normal ALT as ≤ 30 U/L for men and ≤ 19 U/L for women) and serum HBV DNA above 
20,000 IU/ml may start treatment without a liver biopsy. On this basis, the trials enrolled patients 
Assessment report

eligible for treatment. According to EASL, tenofovir or entecavir would be the two preferred first-line 
monotherapies for treatment for patients who do not wish to try, or are not eligible for, PEG-IFN alfa 2. 
TAF is similarly efficacious to TDF in the HBeAg-negative population. Based on effect on HBV DNA, TAF 
is clearly effective but it may be not quite as good as TDF in the HBeAg-positive population, even 
though the lower bound of the 95% CI was within the applicant’s pre-defined criterion. Nevertheless, 
there is no reason to preclude the use of TAF as an alternative to TDF in HBeAg positive patients. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
In the Phase 3 HBV studies 866 patients took TAF. The median ([Q1], [Q3]) exposures were nearly 
identical between TAF (56.1 [48.1, 64.4] weeks) and TDF (56.1 [48.1, 64.7] weeks). More than half in 
each treatment group had received assigned treatment for ≥ 56 weeks at the time of the Week 48 
data cut-off date (TAF 60.5 %; TDF 62.0 %). There was no statistically significant difference between 
groups in the overall Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to premature discontinuation of study drug.

Fractures were uncommon (6 TAF, 1 TDF), the result of trauma, considered by the investigators as 
unrelated to the study drugs and did not result in permanent discontinuation of study drugs. Patients 
who received TAF experienced significantly less BMD reduction than those receiving TDF. At Week 48, 
the mean (SD) percentage decreases from baseline were as follows:  
•  Hip: TAF −0.163% (2.2437 %); TDF –1.860 % (2.4525 %) 
•  Spine: TAF −0.570 % (2.9147 %); TDF −2.366 % (3.2051 %)

The distribution of the clinical BMD status adjusted for baseline status was significantly different 
between treatment groups at Week 48 at the hip (p < 0.001) and at Weeks 24 and 48 at the spine (p 
< 0.001), with fewer in the TAF group having worsening BMD status vs. TDF group. The TAF group 
also demonstrated a smaller effect on bone turnover markers. 
There were no cases of proximal renal tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome) or renal failure in 
either treatment group. Increases from baseline in mean serum creatinine were smaller in the TAF 
group at Week 48 (0.010 vs. 0.024 mg/dL; p = 0.012). Graded serum creatinine abnormalities were 
reported for 6 TAF patients (0.7%), all of which were Grade 1 or 2, and no TDF patients. Five of the 6 
had isolated serum creatinine elevations that were not associated with decreased eGFR. The other had 
a history of hypertension and diabetes, multiple instances of graded creatinine elevations and had 
eGFR ≤ 50 mL/min.

Creatinine (mg/dL) by Visit in the TAF Phase 3 Safety Population (Observed Data; Safety Analysis 
Set) 
Decreases from baseline in median eGFRCG values were significantly smaller in the TAF group (median 
changes at Week 48 were −1.2 mL/min vs. −5.4 mL/min; p < 0.001).  
The median changes in eGFR CKD-EPI, creatinine from baseline at Week 48 were −1.2 mL/min/1.73m2 in the 
TAF group and −2.2 mL/min/1.73m2 in the TDF group (p = 0.007). Confirmed renal laboratory 
abnormalities (increases from baseline in creatinine ≥ 0.5 mg/dL or eGFRcg < 50 mL/min or confirmed 
phosphorus < 2 mg/dL) occurred in 5 TAF patients (0.6%) and 7 TDF patients (1.6%). Most instances 
were isolated, transient and resolved without treatment. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were no deaths that occurred during treatment. One TAF patient died 3 days after the last dose 
of study drug (H1N1 influenza and cardiorespiratory arrest subsequent to organ failure).

No SAEs were considered related to study drugs by the investigators. Most occurred in only one patient 
and therefore SAEs were very varied in nature. One TAF patient had a SAE of acute kidney injury 2 
days after discontinuation of study drug. This was the patient who died and had H1N1 influenza.

Similar percentages (TAF 1.8%; TDF 1.6%) had AEs that led to interruption of study drug. Increased 
ALT was the only AE resulting in interruption in > 1 patient (TAF 2).  
Laboratory findings 
Most patients (TAF 94.8%; TDF 91.1%) had at least one laboratory abnormality, of which 28.4% vs. 
29.4% in respective groups were Grade 1 and 35.0% vs. 32.2% were Grade 2 in severity. Grade 3/4 
AEs were reported in 31.3% TAF and 29.4% TDF patients, of which most were Grade 3 (26.2% vs. 
22.4%). 
Median values of all haematology parameters remained within normal ranges for all time points in both 
studies. Abnormalities of individual haematology parameters were generally balanced between 
treatment groups but a lower percentage in the TAF group (6.2%) had low haemoglobin compared 
with the TDF group (13.4%). There were no clinically relevant changes from baseline within either 
treatment group and no differences between the treatment groups in median values for assessed 
serum chemistry parameters. Median values of all serum chemistry parameters remained within 
normal ranges. Hepatic laboratory abnormalities occurred with lower overall incidence in the TAF group 
compared with the TDF group.  
•  Graded ALT increased occurred in 22.8% TAF and 30.4% patients with AST increased in 22.2% vs. 
25.2% and total bilirubin increased in 12.7% vs. 10.0%.  
•  Grade 3 or 4 ALT elevation occurred in 8.1% TAF and 9.3% TDF patients.  
•  Grade 3 or 4 elevations of AST occurred in 3.3% TAF vs. 5.4% TDF patients. 
•  Grade 3 or 4 bilirubin elevations occurred in TAF 0.3% and TDF 0.2% and no patient had Grade 3 
or 4 ALT or AST elevations coincident with Grade 3 or 4 total bilirubin elevations.  
Five (0.6%) in the TAF group and 3 (0.7%) in the TDF group had elevations in ALT or AST > 3×ULN 
concurrent with elevations in total bilirubin > 2×ULN. All elevations > 3×ULN in ALT or AST plus 
> 2×ULN in total bilirubin were isolated and transient. Two had AEs associated with the elevation: 
•  One TAF patient who had Grade 1 elevated ALT and AST and Grade 3 elevated total bilirubin at 
baseline experienced a Grade 3 SAE of pancreatitis at Week 48 coincident with Grade 2 elevated 
ALT, Grade 4 elevated total bilirubin, Grade 3 elevated amylase and Grade 2 elevated lipase. The 
event resolved 5 days after onset, was considered by the investigator to be unrelated to study 
drugs and did not result in discontinuation of study drugs. No additional laboratory data were 
available after the Week 48 visit. 
•  One TAF patient had Grade 4 hepatic encephalopathy with sepsis associated with H1N1 influenza. 
This patient had a Grade 3 increase in AST at Week 12 shortly before the onset of the events.

Subjects were counted once for the maximum post-baseline severity for each laboratory test. 
For urinalysis (i.e. urine glucose, urine protein, and urine RBC), the highest grade is Grade 3. 
For non-fasting glucose, the maximum post-baseline toxicity grades, instead of treatment-emergent abnormalities, were summarized, because non-fasting 
glucose test was not done at baseline. 
ALT elevations defined as ALT > 2×baseline and > 10×ULN, with or without associated symptoms, were 
observed for 16 (1.8%) in the TAF group and 9 (2.1%) in the TDF group. Most of the events were at 
isolated time points within the first 8 weeks of dosing and resolved without recurrence while the 
patient remained on study drug. One additional TAF patient had an ALT elevation during the 
treatment-free follow-up period, 66 days following discontinuation of study drugs. 
An ALT elevation that was confirmed at 2 consecutive post-baseline visits was considered an ALT flare. 
Five (0.6%) TAF and 4 (0.9%) TDF patients had ALT flares. All except two flares occurred early in the 
dosing period (baseline to Week 8). In 7/9 the ALT flares resolved without recurrence despite 
continuing study drug. One TAF patient discontinued early and the ALT level remained elevated 4 weeks 
after the discontinuation (the last time point available). These flares typically were not associated with 
coincident elevations in bilirubin (one TDF patient had a concurrent Grade 1 bilirubin elevation). 
Median decreases from baseline in total cholesterol, LDL, HDL and triglycerides were greater in the TDF 
group with reductions in all parameters at Week 48. The difference between groups in median change 
from baseline was statistically significant at Week 48 for total cholesterol, direct LDL, HDL and 
triglycerides (p < 0.001). Eight (0.9%) TAF patients had Grade 3 elevated fasting cholesterol, of which 
7 had a history of hyperlipidaemia and/or elevated fasting cholesterol at baseline. No TAF patients had 
Grade 4 elevated fasting cholesterol and no TDF patients had Grade 3 or 4 elevated fasting cholesterol 
but 37 (4.4%) TAF and one (0.2%) TDF patient had Grade 3 elevated fasting LDL.

•  Male patients had a lower overall incidence of AEs (TAF: male 66.0% vs. female 77.3%; TDF: male 
65.8% vs. female 70.1%). The overall difference was primarily driven by higher rates of a small 
number of specific AEs, such as URTI, dyspepsia, nausea or vomiting.  
• 
• 
• 
Percentages with any AE were slightly higher in those aged ≥ 50 years in both treatment groups 
(TAF: < 50 years 68.9% and ≥ 50 years 74.6%; TDF: < 50 years 64.7% and ≥ 50 years 73.6%). 
Incidences for individual AE PTs generally were consistent between treatment groups by age. 
Percentages experiencing any AE were comparable in Asian or non-Asian racial subgroups. 
Percentages with any AE were comparable in patients with normal or elevated baseline ALT (TAF: 
≤ ULN 71.0% and > ULN 70.1%; TDF: ≤ ULN 62.8% and > ULN 67.9%).  
•  Baseline HBV DNA levels (< 8 log10 IU/mL or ≥ 8 log10 IU/mL) did not impact on AE rates.  
The AEs that led to discontinuation in Phase 3 studies occurred at similar rates between treatment 
groups. Two AEs leading to discontinuation were reported for > 1 patient in either treatment group. 
These were nausea [TAF 2; TDF 0] and HCC [TAF 1; TDF 2 subjects]. 
Additional safety data to Week 72 or more 
In the safety update provided during the procedure the median (Q1, Q3) exposures were similar 
between treatment groups (88.1 [80.1, 96.0] weeks in the TAF group and 88.1 [80.1, 96.0] weeks in 
the TDF group across the two studies. Up to the cut-off date no clinically relevant differences in the 
type, frequency and severity of AEs, including SAEs, were observed between treatments. Study drug-
related AEs and AEs leading to premature study drug discontinuation were infrequent. None of the 
SAEs was considered by the investigator to be related to study drugs.  
Table 76.  GS-US-320-0108 and GS-US-320-0110: Overall Summary of Adverse Events Through 
Week 72 (Safety Analysis Set) 
The rate and types of AEs were similar in the two treatment groups. As shown below, the most 
common were nasopharyngitis, headache and URTI.

Organ Class and Preferred Term Through Week 72 in Either Treatment Group (Safety Analysis Set) 
Three (one TAF) new potential uveitis events were observed between Week 48 and 72. No additional 
subject experienced an eye disorder SAE after Week 48. 
Up to Week 48 two deaths had occurred after study drugs were discontinued and were considered not 
treatment emergent. In the update another three deaths (one TAF) were reported to have occurred 
after study drugs were discontinued and were considered not treatment emergent.  
The TAF patient died as a consequence of HCC (diagnosed Day 401) on Day 459, 17 days after 
receiving the last dose of study drug. HCC was the only SAE reported at a frequency > 1% in either 
treatment group: 0.3% (3/866) in the TAF group and 1.2% (5/432) in the TDF group. 
The rate and types of AEs leading to premature discontinuation of study drugs were similar in the two 
treatment groups. Nausea was the only AE leading to premature discontinuation of study drugs that 
occurred in > 1 subject in either treatment group (TAF 2 subjects). 
Grade 3 or 4 chemistry laboratory abnormalities that occurred in > 5% included increased ALT (TAF 
8.4% [72/859]; TDF 9.3% [40/428]), increased fasting LDL cholesterol (TAF 5.7% [48]; TDF 0.5% 
[2]) and increased AST (TAF 3.5% [30]; TDF 5.4% [23]). Nine (1.1%) in the TAF group and no TDF 
subjects had Grade 3 or 4 fasting increased glucose but there were no additional cases between weeks 
48 and 72. No Grade 3 or 4 haematology laboratory abnormalities occurred in > 1% of subjects. 
Six (5 TAF) of 1298 patients met Hy’s Law criteria up to the Week 72 data cut-off. Three of the 5 TAF 
patients had concurrent AEs (biliary pancreatitis, H1N1 influenza and hepatitis E) associated with 
transaminase and bilirubin elevations. The other 3 had ALT elevations early on during treatment that 
resolved without sequelae and were consistent with on-treatment ALT elevation or flare. All 6 had 
elevated total bilirubin levels at baseline (mostly indirect bilirubin) and in 3/6 this did not worsen or 
actually declined on treatment. Thus, the events are most likely due to treatment of underlying viral

hepatitis and not drug-induced liver toxicity. Resolution of the events with continued TAF or TDF 
therapy in 5 cases is not consistent with DILI. 
The pattern of median changes in fasting lipid parameters was similar at Weeks 48 and 72.

b P-values were calculated from the 2-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test to compare the 2 treatment groups. 
No further reductions in fasting lipid parameters were observed in the TDF group from Week 48 to 72. 
Fasting lipid parameters remained relatively stable through Week 72 in the TAF group.  
Differences in mean percentage decreases from baseline in hip or spine BMD were statistically 
significant for the TAF group compared with the TDF group at both Weeks 48 and 72 (p < 0.001). For 
both hip and spine BMD, the difference in least-squares mean (LSM) between the TAF and TDF groups 
was greater at Week 72 compared with Week 48. There was little change in the TAF group but further 
decreases in hip and spine (latter changed less than hip) BMD from Week 48 to 72 in the TDF group.

the TAF group, the mean change from baseline in the TDF group was lower at Week 72 compared with 
Week 48. Decreases from baseline in median eGFRCG were less in the TAF group compared with the

No subjects experienced an AE of proximal tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome). 
Four TAF (0.5%) subjects experienced 5 renal SAEs (nephrolithiasis [2]; ureterolithiasis and 
haematuria [1]; ureterolithiasis [1]) and one (0.2%) TDF subject had 2 renal SAEs of calculus urinary. 
These renal SAEs were considered not related to study drug by the investigator and resolved. One TAF 
patient with H1n1 influenza (who died) had a SAE of acute kidney injury 2 days after discontinuation of 
study drug and prior to Week 48 that was considered not to be related to study drug by the 
investigator. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The most relevant safety database for this application concerns the 866 patients exposed to TAF in the 
Phase 3 HBV studies. Data were reported initially when ~60% per group had taken TAF for ≥ 56 
weeks. The applicant provided an update of all available safety data. With the exception of renal and 
bone effects and the plasma lipid profiles the safety profile of TAF was very similar to that of TDF even 
though plasma levels of TFV are much lower when dosing with TAF. 
Regarding effects on bone, the various measurements presented consistently indicated a lesser effect 
of TAF, including an apparently minimal effect of TAF on hip and spine BMD. Although relatively more 
fractures occurred with TAF when taking 2:1 randomisation into account these do not seem to be 
treatment-related. Therefore the data were consistent with the results in the Phase 3 studies that 
compared Genvoya with Stribild in the HIV-infected population.  
So far there have been no cases of proximal renal tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome) or renal 
failure in either treatment group. Although increases from baseline in mean serum creatinine were 
significantly smaller in the TAF group at Week 48 there was no significant difference at Week 72 but 
there was a lesser effect of TAF on eGFR at Weeks 48 and 72.  
Graded hepatic laboratory abnormalities (all and ≥ Grade 3) occurred slightly less often in the TAF 
group. Hy’s Law was potentially met in 5 TAF and one TDF patient but details of these cases indicate 
that they had alternative explanations or that they had resolution despite continuing treatment, which 
does not suggest DILI. ALT flares (as defined in the protocols) have occurred on and post-treatment 
and both types of event should be carefully evaluated in the post-approval period (see further below).    
As in the Phase 3 studies that compared Genvoya with Stribild, the HBV studies showed an apparent 
beneficial effect of TDF on fasting cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides. In the 
TAF group there were either small decreases from baseline (fasting cholesterol and HDL cholesterol) 
that were less than the decreases in the TDF group or modest increases (LDL cholesterol and 
triglycerides) from baseline. The fasting total cholesterol to HDL ratios were not different between 
treatments. Overall, in the absence of concomitant HIV and medications that can themselves increase 
plasma lipids, the effect of TAF per se was either negative or gave small increases. The data do not 
raise a major concern. 
More patients in the TAF group developed hyperglycaemia and/or elevated urine glucose during 
treatment. In some cases there is no plausible explanation for development of hyperglycaemia. As for 
the TAF-containing HIV FDCs, special attention will be paid to cases of hyperglycaemia reported post-
approval but at present there is a lack of clear association with TAF.  
In the Phase 3 studies 7 (0.8%) in the TAF group vs. 1 (0.2%) in the TDF group developed an AE of 
vision blurred which could potentially be a symptom of uveitis. The applicant provided details of the 
cases, which do not point to a clear association with TAF at present. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the

Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
TAF was well tolerated as demonstrated by the low percentages of subjects who had Grade 3 or 4 
adverse events, SAEs, or who discontinued study drugs due to AEs in the Phase 3 program. The rate 
and types of AEs were similar in the 2 treatment groups, and a similar percentage of subjects had 
Grade 3 or 4 and laboratory abnormalities. Various measurements performed consistently indicated a 
lesser bone effect of TAF. No proximal tubulopathy was observed and lesser effect of TAF on eGFR was 
observed. Treatment with TAF was associated with slight increases from baseline of lipid laboratory 
parameters. The safety data do not raise a major concern.

Section 4.6 of the SmPC provides TAF 
information on pregnancy in humans. 
Studies in animals have shown no 
evidence of teratogenicity (rats and 
rabbits) or an effect on reproductive 
function (rats) due to TAF. The use of 
TAF may be considered during 
pregnancy, if necessary. 
Section 4.6 of the SmPC provides 
information that it is unknown whether 
TAF is excreted in human milk, however, 
in animal studies it has been shown that 
tenofovir is secreted into milk.  There is 
insufficient information on the effects of 
tenofovir in newborns/infants. A risk to 
the breastfed child cannot be excluded; 
therefore, TAF should not be used during 
breastfeeding. 
Section 4.2 of the SmPC states that in 
renal impairment no dose adjustment of 
TAF is required for adults or adolescents 
(aged at least 12 years and of at least 
35 kg body weight) with estimated CrCl 
≥ 15 mL/min or in patients with CrCl < 
15 mL/min who are receiving 
hemodialysis. On days of hemodialysis, 
TAF should be administered after 
completion of hemodialysis treatment. 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC states that 
there are no safety data on the use of 
TAF to treat HBV-infected patients with 
CrCl <30 mL/min, and the use of TAF is 
not recommended in patients with CrCl 
< 15 mL/min who are not receiving

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 0.6 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers that tenofovir alafenamide is not a new active 
substance, as it is a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European 
Union. Tenofovir alafenamide is contained in the marketing authorisation Genvoya which was 
authorised in the European Union on 19/11/2015. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Vemlidy (tenofovir alafenamide) is included 
in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was 
Assessment report  
EMA/793580/2016 
Page 151/156 
  
  
 
not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Favourable effects 
TAF was selected for development for treatment of HIV and HBV because it had potential to be 
similarly active with much lower TFV plasma levels and hence improved safety vs. TDF. Study GS-US-
320-0101 provided preliminary evidence that TAF 25 mg could exert a similar effect on HBV as 300 mg 
TDF in the short term despite achieving plasma TFV levels ~6-fold lower. The selection of the 25 mg 
TAF dose for treatment of HBV is further supported by two Phase 3 studies in which TAF was compared 
with TDF. In HBeAg-negative and HBeAg-positive populations the lower bound of the 95% CI around 
the difference in percentages of patients achieving HBV DNA < 29 IU/mL at Week 48 fell within the  
pre-defined non-inferiority margin (10%). In the HBeAg-negative population the lower bound of the 
95% CI fell within -5%. In the HBeAg-positive population the lower bound of the 95% CI fell near to -
10% in the FAS and PP analyses. In both populations TAF had a greater beneficial effect (see effects 
table) than TDF on ALT.  
Same as in the Phase 3 studies that compared Genvoya with Stribild in the HIV-infected population, 
the Phase 3 HBV studies showed that TAF had a lesser effect on BMD and other markers of bone 
turnover compared with TDF (see effects Table). Another beneficial effect is that the renal safety 
profile of TAF appears to be better than that of TDF, with lesser effects on several markers of renal and 
proximal renal tubular function in the HIV- and HBV-infected populations. 
3.2.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There is a risk of reduced efficacy if TAF 25 mg is given with inducers of P-gp and CHMP agreed that 
co-administration is not recommended.  
There is no information on the use of TAF 25 mg in HIV/HBV co-infected patients but there is no 
reason why TAF 25 mg tablets, if used in conjunction with other appropriate antiretroviral agents, 
could not be used to treat both infections. Although there are no data on use of TAF 25 mg in HBV-HCV 
co-infected patients, there is no reason why patients could not be treated for HCV while taking TAF 25 
mg for HBV. The lack of clinical safety and efficacy data in HCV as well as hepatitis D-infected patients 
is stated in the SmPC. 
Regarding the efficacy of TAF in the HBeAg-positive population, further analyses of covariates 
associated with virologic failure do not explain the differences vs. TDF although the Week 72 analyses 
suggest that the difference gets smaller over time. 
There were very few black patients (13; 7 TAF) enrolled in the Phase 3 studies. In this very small 
subset virologic responses were not lower in blacks compared with other racial groups. Within each 
study, the HBV DNA responses for whites were similar across the TAF and TDF treatment groups. In 
study GS US 320 0108, similar response rates were observed in white and non-white patients but in 
GS US 320 0110 lower response rates were observed in whites in both treatment groups. Further 
exploration of the latter study showed that whites had higher rates of several factors identified to be 
associated with lack of virological response to TAF and TDF.

3.3.  Unfavourable effects 
The most relevant safety database for this application concerns 866 patients exposed to TAF in the 
Phase 3 HBV studies. With the exception of beneficial effects of TAF vs. TDF on renal and bone markers 
and the lack of beneficial effect of TAF vs. TDF on plasma lipid profiles, the safety profile of TAF was 
very similar to that of TDF even though plasma levels of TFV are much lower when dosing with TAF. 
3.4.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Data from Phase 3 studies were initially provided when ~60% of patients per treatment group had 
taken TAF for ≥ 56 weeks. Markers of renal and bone function/turnover support beneficial effects of 
TAF vs. TDF but there were no significant differences between treatments in clinical renal and bone 
AEs. The applicant provided an update of available safety data in which median (Q1, Q3) exposures 
were 88.1 [80.1, 96.0] weeks for TAF and 88.1 [80.1, 96.0] weeks for TDF. The additional data 
generally suggest a continued benefit for TAF on the markers previously reported. The two Phase 3 
studies have since been extended to Week 384 and therefore very long term safety data will eventually 
emerge, including data on the effects of switching from TDF to TAF at Week 144. These long-term and 
switch data should help to confirm whether any apparent safety benefits of TAF are sustained. 
Grade 3 or 4 hepatic laboratory abnormalities occurred in 8.1% TAF and 9.3% TDF patients. Hy’s Law 
was potentially met in 5 TAF and 1 TDF patient but detailed review of the cases did not indicate that 
DILI was likely to have occurred.  
As in the Phase 3 studies that compared Genvoya with Stribild, the HBV studies showed an apparent 
beneficial effect of TDF on fasting cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides. In the 
TAF group there were either small decreases from baseline (fasting cholesterol and HDL cholesterol) 
that were less than the decreases in the TDF group or modest increases (LDL cholesterol and 
triglycerides) from baseline. The fasting total cholesterol to HDL ratios did not differ between 
treatments. Overall, in the absence of concomitant HIV and medications that can themselves increase 
plasma lipids, the effect of TAF per se was either negative or gave small increases. The clinical 
implications, if any, are unknown. 
Regarding the rates of AEs of hyperglycaemia reported for TAF in the Phase 3 studies, a causal 
relationship between TAF and hyperglycaemia is not established but cannot be ruled out and will be re-
assessed in the post-approval period. 
In the Phase 3 safety population numerically more patients in the TAF group developed an AE of vision 
blurred which could potentially be a symptom of uveitis (TAF 0.8%, 7 subjects; TDF 0.2 %, 1 subject). 
Cases of vision blurred were further explained but at present it does not seem that these AEs reflected 
uveitis. 
During review of Genvoya and Descovy it was agreed that 10 mg TAF should be used when it is given 
with a strong inhibitor of P-gp. When treating HBV a dose reduction to TAF 10 mg daily is not possible 
since there is only a 25 mg tablet to be marketed. Chronic exposure to plasma TFV that is higher than 
would occur with TAF 25 mg without a P-gp inhibitor could result in some loss of beneficial effects on 
safety vs. TDF. Therefore co-administration of TAF 25 mg with strong P-gp inhibitors is not 
recommended.  
In patients with CrCL between 15-29 mL/min the plasma levels of TFV after a 25 mg TAF dose did not 
exceed the exposures that occur with TDF 300 mg in patients with normal renal function. Also, in ESRD 
patients on thrice weekly haemodialysis plasma TFV exposures are predicted to be in the range 
documented for dosing TDF 300 mg in patients with normal renal function. The safety profile of TAF 25 
mg in these patient sub-groups can be expected to resemble that of TDF in patients with normal renal

function. For patients with CrCL <15 mL/min and not on haemodialysis the SmPC now clarifies that use 
of 25 mg TAF is not recommended due to lack of any data to support this.  
Taking into account the metabolic pathway, thus far there does not appear to be a link between TAF-
associated hyperuricaemia and gout or other AEs that could be due to hyperuricaemia (including renal 
stones). Up to Week 72 four TAF (0.5%) patients experienced 5 renal SAEs (nephrolithiasis [2]; 
ureterolithiasis and haematuria [1]; ureterolithiasis [1]) and 1 (0.2%) TDF patient had 2 renal SAEs of 
calculus urinary. These renal SAEs were considered not related to study drug by the investigator and 
resolved. With 2:1 randomisation and lack of details on stones it is not known whether TAF is 
associated with uric acid stones and the total rates of renal calculi were 1% for TAF and 0.9% for TDF. 
Two AEs of gout (1 in each treatment group) and 2 AEs of hyperuricaemia (1 in each treatment group) 
were reported through the Week 72 data cut. These events were Grade 1 (mild) in severity with the 
exception of 1 AE of hyperuricaemia (TDF group; Grade 2). All AEs resolved with continued study drug 
treatment, and none was considered to be related to study drug by the investigator. In each case 
patients had evidence of elevated serum uric acid levels at baseline and the patient with the AE of gout 
in the TAF group had a history of gouty arthritis. Nevertheless, this matter needs to be kept under 
review.

3.6.  Benefit-risk balance 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
TAF has been shown to achieve high virologic suppression rates in the HBeAg-negative population that 
are similar to those of TDF. TAF is associated with numerically lower virologic suppression rates vs. 
TDF in the HBeAg-positive population. The safety profile of TAF 25 mg in HBV-infected patients is 
similar or improved vs. that of TDF. 
3.6.2.  Conclusions 
The overall the risk/benefit balance of Vemlidy is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Vemlidy is favourable in the following indication: 
Vemlidy is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adults and adolescents (aged 12 years 
and older with body weight at least 35 kg) (see section 5.1). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/793580/2016 
Page 155/156 
  
  
 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the review of the available data, the CHMP considers that tenofovir alafenamide is a 
derivative of tenofovir disoproxil (both prodrugs of tenofovir). The CHMP has also considered all the 
arguments presented by the applicant in the marketing authorisation dossier and concluded that the 
active substance tenofovir alafenamide is contained in the marketing authorisation Genvoya which was 
authorised in the Union on 19/11/2015. Tenofovir alafenamide is therefore not a new active substance 
in itself, as it is a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union.

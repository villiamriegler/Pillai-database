Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Arsenic trioxide medac 
arsenic trioxide 
On 23 July 2020, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Arsenic 
trioxide medac, intended for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). The applicant for this 
medicinal product is medac Gesellschaft für klinische Spezialpräparate mbH. 
Arsenic trioxide medac will be available as 1 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion. The active 
substance of Arsenic trioxide medac is arsenic trioxide, an antineoplastic agent (ATC code: L01XX27). The 
mechanism of action of arsenic trioxide is not completely understood but it causes fragmentation, 
damage or degradation of DNA and the fusion protein pro-myelocytic leukaemia/retinoic acid receptor-
alpha (PML/RAR alpha) in promyelocytic leukaemia cells. 
Arsenic trioxide medac is a generic of Trisenox, which has been authorised in the EU since 5 March 2002. 
Since Arsenic trioxide medac is administered intravenously and is 100% bioavailable, a bioequivalence 
study versus the reference product Trisenox was not required. A question and answer document on 
generic medicines can be found here. 
The full indication is:  
Arsenic trioxide medac is indicated for induction of remission, and consolidation in adult patients 
with: 
• 
• 
Newly diagnosed low-to-intermediate risk acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) (white 
blood cell count, ≤ 10 x 10³/µl) in combination with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) 
Relapsed/refractory APL (previous treatment should have included a retinoid and 
chemotherapy) 
characterised by the presence of the t(15;17) translocation and/or the presence of the Pro-
Myelocytic Leukaemia/Retinoic-Acid-Receptor-alpha (PML/RAR-alpha) gene. 
The response rate of other acute myelogenous leukaemia subtypes to arsenic trioxide has not 
been examined.

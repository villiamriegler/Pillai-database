2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Overall, gliomas account for 70% of adult malignant primary brain tumours (Ricard, D., et al., 2012). 
The incidence of malignant glioma is ~5/100 000 and may develop at all ages, the peak incidence 
being in the fifth and sixth decades of life. Malignant glioma comprises of glioblastoma [World Health 
Organization (WHO) Grade IV], anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO Grade III), mixed anaplastic 
oligoastrocytoma (WHO Grade III) and anaplastic oligodendroglioma (WHO Grade III) (Stupp, R., et 
al., 2010). 
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most frequent primary malignant brain tumour occurring in adults, and has 
the worst prognosis. Less than 3% of glioblastoma patients are still alive at 5 years after diagnosis, 
higher age being the most significant predictor of poor outcome (Ohgaki H, Kleihues P, 2005, Sant M. 
at al., 2011). GBMs only very rarely disseminate outside the Central Nervous System (CNS) and 
relapse usually occurs at the original tumour site. 
GBM can develop at any site within the central nervous system but is most commonly located in the 
cerebral hemisphere. Surgical debulking of tumour may diminish or alleviate symptoms associated with 
mass effect. Symptomatic management is also effective in controlling seizures (anti-epileptic 
medications) and cerebral edema (corticosteroids). However, all patients with GBM eventually develop 
tumour progression and associated symptomatic deterioration.  
Current treatment option in newly diagnosed glioblastoma include Temozolomide  in combination with 
radiotherapy based on a survival benefit compared to radiotherapy alone.  
Bevacizumab (Avastin) is a recombinant humanised monoclonal antibody. It inhibits angiogenesis by 
neutralising all isoforms of human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and blocking their 
binding to VEGF receptors.  
Avastin was approved in the European Union (EU) on 12 January 2005 for the first-line treatment of 
patients with metastatic cancer of the colon or rectum (mCRC), in combination with intravenous 5- 
fluorouracil/folinic acid or intravenous 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid/irinotecan. Following this, Avastin was 
approved for the treatment of locally recurrent and metastatic breast cancer, for non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC), for renal cell cancer, for the first-line ovarian cancer, and in combination with 
carboplatin and gemcitabine for treatment of adult patients with first recurrence of platinum-sensitive 
epithelian ovarian fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who have not received prior therapy with 
bevacizumab or other VEGF inhibitors or VEGF receptor–targeted agents.

This variation concerns an application for extension of the approved indications for Avastin. The MAH 
applied for the indication: 
“Avastin, in combination with radiation and temozolomide, is indicated for the treatment of patients 
with newly diagnosed gliomas (WHO Grade III or IV)”. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
There was no environmental risk assessment submitted as part of this application. 
2.2.2.  Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
A justification for not providing an updated Environmental Risk assessment for this new indication has 
been submitted by the MAH. This is in accordance with the Guideline on the Environmental Risk 
assessment for Human medicinal products (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00, 2006) which states that for 
certain pharmacologically active substances, among others proteins, such is possible, as these 
substances are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment.  
Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that is a recombinant humanised immunoglobulin of isotype 
IgG1 and as a protein bevacizumab is exempted from providing an ERA. 
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
There are no new non-clinical data submitted as part of this application and the absence of an ERA is 
considered acceptable. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trial was performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The potential of drug-drug interaction (DDI) between bevacizumab and temozolomide was evaluated in 
a substudy of pivotal Study BO21990.  
The BO21990 DDI substudy was conducted during the maintenance phase, which followed a treatment 
break  after  the  concurrent  treatment  phase  in  Study  BO21990.  During  the  maintenance  phase, 
patients  received  temozolomide  and  bevacizumab  or  placebo  for  six  28-day  cycles  or  until  disease 
progression  or  unacceptable  toxicity.  During  the  first  cycle  of  the  maintenance  phase,  temozolomide 
was  to  be  taken  orally  on  the  first  5  days  of  the  28-day  cycle  at  dose  of  150  mg/m2/day.  For 
subsequent  cycles,  the  dose  of  temozolomide  was  to  be  escalated  to  200/mg/m2  if  permitted  by  the 
patient’s  haematologic  and  non-haematologic  toxicity  profile  (according  to  the  National  Cancer 
Institute  Common  Terminology  Criteria  for  Adverse  Events,  Version  3).  Bevacizumab  or  placebo  (10 
mg/kg every 2 weeks) was administered to patients on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. 
The number of patients included in the substudy was 14 in the temozolomide/bevacizumab (T/B) arm 
and  6  in  the  temozolomide/placebo  (T/P)  arm.  Samples  for  bevacizumab  were  obtained  predose  and 
postdose  on  Day  1  of  Cycles  1,  2,  3  of  the  maintenance  phase.  Samples  for  temozolomide  were 
obtained predose, 15 min, 30 min, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4,  6, and 8 hrs postdose on Day 1 of Cycle 1 of the 
maintenance phase. 
The  PK  outcome  measures  for  the  BO21990  DDI  substudy  were  to  summarize  the  observed  plasma 
temozolomide  concentrations  and  estimate  the  PK  parameters  (AUC,  Tmax,  C max)  for  patients  in  the 
placebo  (Pl  +  RT/T)  and  bevacizumab  (Bv  +  RT/T)  treatment  arms  at  Cycle  1,  Day  1  of  the 
maintenance phase. In addition, the observed serum bevacizumab trough and peak concentrations in 
patients  in  the  bevacizumab  treatment  arm  during  Cycles  1,  2,  and  3  during  the  maintenance  phase 
were  to  be  summarized  and  the  observed  bevacizumab  exposures  compared  with  the  predicted 
exposure from PPK simulations based on the dose regimen in Study BO21990.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology  
A substudy of BO21990 investigating potential drug-drug interaction when bevacizumab is added to 
temozolomide treatment did not reveal any influence of temozolomide on bevacizumab exposure. The 
temozolomide exposure seems to be moderately increased by the presence of bevacizumab. The 
substudy included only 6 patients treated with temozolomide. No firm conclusions can be drawn on the 
potential for bevacizumab to modify the exposure of temozolomide. However, no DDI is expected 
between a monoclonal antibody like bevacizumab and a small molecule like temozolomide. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on clinical pharmacology 
Although data from a substudy of BO21990 indicate that temozolomide exposure seems to be 
moderately increased by the presence of bevacizumab, no DDI is expected between a monoclonal 
antibody like bevacizumab and a small molecule like temozolomide. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
No new studies have been carried out in the claimed population (see discussion on Clinical efficacy).

2.4.2.  Main study 
BO21990 (Avaglio)  
This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multicenter Phase III trial of bevacizumab, 
temozolomide and radiotherapy, followed by bevacizumab and temozolomide versus placebo, 
temozolomide and radiotherapy followed by placebo and temozolomide in patients with newly 
diagnosed glioblastoma.

Treatments 
Trial treatment was to start between 4 and 7 weeks after debulking surgery or biopsy of the GBM. Trial 
treatment consisted of three phases as described in Figure 3.

Figure 3. Study design 
If adverse events occurred that necessitated delaying bevacizumab, the dose would remain unchanged 
once  treatment  resumed.  Patients  could  be  withdrawn  from  any  of  the  trial  treatment  components 
(radiotherapy, TMZ or Bv), or from any combination of these three treatment components, however if 
radiotherapy was discontinued all trial treatment was to be discontinued.  
Objectives 
The primary objectives of the study were to demonstrate superiority in progression-free survival (PFS) 
as assessed by the investigator and in overall survival (OS) when Bv is added to TMZ with radiotherapy 
(Stupp regimen) followed by TMZ for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed GBM.  
Secondary  objectives  included  the  comparison  of    PFS  as  assessed  by  an  independent  review  facility 
(IRF) between treatment arms the comparison of  1-year and 2-year survival rates between treatment 
arms the  evaluation and comparison of the safety profile between treatment arms and the comparison 
of  health-related quality of life (EORTC QLQ C-30, BN-20) between treatment arms. 
Exploratory Objectives 
To  compare  the  objective  response  rate  (ORR),  and  the  duration  of  objective  response,  between 
treatment arms 
To assess and compare OS and PFS between and within arms in relation to MGMT status 
To compare neurocognitive function (NCF) using MMSE between treatment arms 
To explore and compare the use of corticosteroids between treatment arms 
To explore and compare the signs and symptoms related to GBM and patient’s KPS between treatment 
arms 
To explore and compare the patterns of tumour progression between treatment arms  
Substudy Objectives 
To compare neurocognitive function between treatment arms 
To explore and compare the correlation between the neurocognitive function and the BO21990 efficacy 
outcome measures within and between treatment arms

Outcomes/endpoints 
The co-primary endpoints of this trial were OS defined as the time from randomization to death due to 
any cause and  PFS as assessed by the investigator, defined as the time from randomization until the 
first date of either objective disease progression (using adapted MacDonald Response Criteria) or death 
due to any cause. Disease progression was based on radiographic or photographic evidence, and 
assessments made by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1. 
The key secondary endpoints were the following: 
• 
PFS as assessed by an independent review facility (IRF). 
•  One-year and two-year overall survival defined as the percentage of patients who are still alive at 
1 year and 2 years post-randomization, respectively. 
•  Health-related  quality  of  life  (HRQoL)  Changes.  HRQoL  was  assessed  by  a  core  instrument  of  the 
EORTC (EORTC QLQ-C30) supplemented by a brain cancer specific module (EORTC BN20). 
The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a  30-item self-report questionnaire on which patients rate the items on a 
4-point  scale,  from  1  “not  at  all”  to  4  “very  much”  (except  for  the  global  health  status  and  QoL 
items  on  a  7-point  scale,  from  1  “very  poor”  to  7  “excellent”).  The  instrument  measures  five 
functional multi-item scales (physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, cognitive 
functioning,  social  functioning),  three  symptoms  scales  (fatigue,  pain,  nausea  and  vomiting),  six 
single-item  measures  (dyspnea,  insomnia,  anorexia,  constipation,  diarrhea,  and  financial  impact) 
and a global health status/QoL scale.  
The  EORTC  BN20  consists  of  four  multi-item  scales  (future  uncertainty,  visual  disorder,  motor 
dysfunction,  communication  deficit)  and  seven  single-item  measures  (headache,  seizures, 
drowsiness, hair loss, itching, difficulty with bladder control, and weakness of both legs).

Exploratory Parameters 
The  following  exploratory  efficacy  parameters  were  defined  in  the  protocol  and  were  analysed 
descriptively: 
Objective response rate (ORR) based on adapted Macdonald criteria.  
Duration of response, defined as time between first response and disease progression or death due to 
any cause. Patients without an event were censored at the date of last follow up for progression.  
OS and PFS in relation to MGMT status. Subgroup analyses of OS and PFS by treatment arm according 
to MGMT status were performed. 
Change over time in neurocognitive function (NCF) according to the MMSE.  
Extent of corticosteroid use over time. 
Change over time in signs and symptoms related to GBM. 
Change in KPS over time. 
Patterns of tumour progression. 
Sample size 
The  sample  size  was  based  on  a  calculation  assuming  a  42  month  recruitment  period  and  minimum 
follow up of approximately 17 months for the last patient enrolled. 
For  the  OS  endpoint,  assuming  a  median  survival  duration  of  18.3  months  in  the  bevacizumab  and 
temozolomide arm and 14.6 months in the placebo and temozolomide arm (corresponding to a hazard 
ratio  of  0.80,  or  a  reduction  in  the  immediate  risk  of  death  by  20%),  then  683  events  would  be 
required to achieve 80% power of the log rank test at a 2-sided overall 4% alpha level. This calculation 
included two interim analyses at approximately 50% and 72% of events (the final PFS analysis was to 
be performed at the time of the second interim analysis).  
For  the  PFS  endpoint,  assuming  a  median  PFS  duration  of  9.1  months  in  the  bevacizumab  and 
temozolomide arm and 7 months in the placebo and temozolomide (corresponding to a hazard ratio of 
Avastin  
EMA/CHMP/268580/2014 
Page 18/75 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
0.769, or a reduction in the immediate risk of progression or death by 23%), 677 events were required 
to  achieve  80%  power  of  the  log  rank  test  at  a  2-sided  1%  alpha  level.  In  the  event  that  less  than 
72%  of  OS  events  had  occurred  at  the  time  of  the  PFS  analysis  (i.e.  less  than  492  of  the  683  death 
events  required),  the  PFS  analysis  would  be  delayed  until  at  least  72%  of  OS  information  was 
available. In order to see the required number of events in the timeframe defined above, and to allow 
for a 10% dropout rate in PFS at 3 years, and a 5% dropout rate in survival at 4 years, 460 patients 
per treatment arm was required. 
Randomisation 
The patients were randomly assigned to receive to RT/TMZ+placebo or RT/TMZ+bevacizumab in a 1:1 
ratio. They were stratified by the following factors: Recursive Partitioning Analysis (RPA) Class (III, IV, 
V) and Region (Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia, USA, other).  
The definition of RPA class by EORTC is based on WHO performance status, type of surgery, age and 
MMSE and is categorized as shown in figure 4.

Randomization and start of treatment was to occur on the same day. When this was not feasible, the 
delay between randomization and start of treatment was to be kept to a minimum and was not to 
exceed 3 days. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind trial. Prior to disease progression, the patients’ treatment allocation blind was 
to be maintained. The only exception was in case of an emergency due to safety reasons. Patients’ 
treatment allocation was to remain blinded at disease progression except if it was deemed necessary 
to unblind by the investigator for deciding on further treatment. 
Statistical methods 
In  order  to  adjust  for  multiplicity  due  to  having  two  primary  endpoints,  the  overall  alpha  of  5%  was 
split with 4% assigned for OS and 1% for PFS. 
The  null  hypothesis  was  tested  with  the  stratified  log  rank  test  (two-sided)  and  the  trial  was 
determined  to  be  positive  if  any  of  the  following  criteria  were  met:  if,  at  the  time  of  the  OS  interim 
Avastin

analysis/final  PFS  analysis,  there  was  a  statistically  significant  difference  between  treatment  arms  in 
PFS in favour of Bv with a HR<0.769 and a non-detrimental effect on OS (HR <1.0); or if, at the time 
of  the  interim  or  final  OS  analysis,  there  was  a  statistically  significant  difference  between  the  two 
treatment arms for OS, in favour of Bv. 
Analyses were performed using the following populations: 
Intent-to-Treat Population (ITT): all patients randomized into the study. For the analysis, patients were 
assigned to the treatment arms to which they were randomized. 
Per-Protocol  Population  (PPP):  all  randomized  patients  who  received  any  radiotherapy,  concomitant 
TMZ and at least 3 doses of Bv/placebo during the Concurrent phase, as well as patients who stopped 
treatment prior to this because of toxicity, disease progression or death. Patients had to have at least 
one disease assessment at baseline and during treatment (unless they died before the first scheduled 
assessment) and no major protocol violation. Patients were grouped as randomized. 
Safety Population: all randomized patients who received at least one dose of trial treatment. Patients 
were assigned to treatment arms according to the treatment actually received. 
In addition the following subsets of the ITT were defined: 
The  protocol  B  population:  all  randomized  patients enrolled  under  protocol  version  B.  One  of  the  key 
changes  that  this  amendment  implemented  was  the  recording  of  signs  and  symptoms  of  GBM,  and 
accordingly these data were analysed using this population. 
The PK population: all randomized patients enrolled in the DDI substudy for whom at least one blood 
sample could be taken for PK. 
The  NCF  population  (subset  of the  protocol  B  population):  all  randomized  patients  who  were  enrolled 
into the NCF substudy and who had a baseline NCF assessment, regardless of  whether they received 
any trial treatment or completed the full course of treatment.

Results 
Participant flow 
Recruitment 
The  first  patient  was  randomized  on  29  June  2009  and  the  last  on  29  March  2011.  A  total  of  921 
patients were enrolled into the study from 120 centers in 23 countries. 
Conduct of the study 
The protocol was amended once (version B). In total, 786 patients were randomized under version A of 
the protocol, while 252 patients were randomized under protocol version B.  
Key changes to the main protocol as a result of the amendment are summarized below: 
 
 
 
Following a recommendation from the DSMB, an additional interim analysis was introduced to be 
triggered when approximately 50% of the deaths required for the final OS analysis had occurred. 
The collection of signs and symptoms of GBM was introduced enabling a new exploratory objective 
“to  explore  and  compare  the  signs  and  symptoms  related  to  GBM  and  patient’s  KPS  between 
treatment arms”. 
An additional tumour assessment was added after disease progression was diagnosed enabling the 
addition  of  a  new  exploratory  objective  “to  explore  and  compare  the  patterns  of  tumour 
progression between treatment arms”.

The  statistical  analysis  plan  was  changed  with  regard  to  testing  of  the  difference  between  the 
arms for the 1-year and 2-year OS rates from a Cochran Mantel Haenzel Test to using a z test.

A linear transformation is used to standardize the raw HRQoL score, so that all scores for the scales and the single-
item measures range from 0 to 100. Stable HRQoL is defined as a change within 10 points. Improved HRQoL is 
defined as an increase of at least 10 points for functioning/global health status, and as a decrease of at least 10 
points for symptoms. The period before each scheduled assessment is considered in calculating the total duration of 
stable and/or improved HRQoL.

•  Biomarker Analysis 
Biomarker  analyses  were  performed  on  those  patients  in  the  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  (all  randomized) 
population who consented separately to participate in the translational research program. Two patient 
populations  were  defined:  biomarker  evaluable  protein  plasma  (BEP)  and  biomarker  evaluable  IHC 
tumour (BEI). 
Following biomarkers were investigated: pVEGF-A, pVEGFR-2, tNRP-1, tCD31 (NV), pVEGFR-1, pVEGF-
C, pVEGFR-3, PDGF-C, tVEGF-A, tVEGFR-2, tVEGFR-1, bFGF, PlGF, E-selectin, ICAM-1, and IL-8. 
No  clear  evidence  of  predictive  value  for  Bv  treatment  in  terms  of  PFS  was  observed  for  any  of  the 
biomarkers.  There  was  no  evidence  of  a  prognostic  effect  of  any  biomarkers  observed  in  the  Pl 
treatment arm (data not shown).

RTOG-0825 STUDY  
RTOG-0825 was a study conducted by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) and funded by 
the US National Cancer Institute, run mainly in the USA. The applicant presented the publicly available 
results of the study further to the CHMP’s request.

RTOG-0825, was a a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, designed to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of Bv combined with standard therapy, consisting of radiotherapy RT 
and TMZ chemotherapy, in newly diagnosed glioblastoma.  
Eligible patients were subsequently randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the control arm or active arm, 
and  received  additional  concurrent  RT+TMZ  concomitantly  with  placebo  or  Bv  (3-week  Concurrent 
Phase). Treatment with placebo or Bv continued uninterrupted (4 weeks) into a 12-cycle Maintenance 
Phase  until  progression  of  disease  (PD).  Patients  could  optionally  complete  questionnaires  evaluating 
HRQoL (EORTC QLQ-C30 and BN20) and symptom burden (MDASI−BT) (Figure x). 
Figure 16. RTOG-0825: Study Design 
In the RTOG-0825 study, only patients who underwent debulking surgery were included, and started 
concurrent RT/T treatment for 3 weeks within 3−5 weeks after the surgery. After this initial induction 
phase of 3 weeks, only patients still eligible were subsequently randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the 
control arm or active arm, and continued to complete the 3 additional weeks of concurrent RT/T 
concomitantly with placebo or bevacizumab. 637 patients were randomized in the RTOG-0825 study as 
compared to the 978 patients initially assessed for eligibility. Following randomization, additional 
patients were further excluded from the analysis population ( Figure 17).

Figure 17. Patient Disposition in RTOG-0825 Study 
The  co-primary  endpoints  were  PFS  and  OS.  Exploratory  analyses  were  also  performed  to  examine 
health-related  quality  of  life  (HRQoL:  EORTC  QLQ-C30/BN20),  neurocognitive  function  (NCF:  mini 
mental status examination [MMSE], Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised [HVLT-R], Trail-Making Test 
A & B [TMT A & B], and Controlled Oral Word Association [COWA]), and symptom burden (MDASI−BT 
tool).  
Results  showed  no  difference  between  the  treatment  arms  for  OS  (median  16.1  months  vs.  15.7 
months; HR 1.13, 95% CI: [0.93, 1.37]; p=0.21) and showed prolonged PFS in the Bv treatment arm 
(median 7.3 months vs. 10.7 months; HR 0.79, 95% CI [0.66, 0.94]; p=0.007) (Table 29).

Table 29. RTOG-0825: Summary of OS and PFS 
The results of the exploratory health-related quality of life endpoints showed neurocognitive 
functioning deterioration addition of Bv to standard therapy (Armstrong et al. 2013; Wefel et al. 2013).  
The safety profile of Bv in RTOG-0825 was consistent with that seen in previous trials across multiple 
tumour types for approved indications. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
No dose-response finding study was performed to establish the optimal dose of Bv for treatment of 
patients with newly diagnosed GBM. Only one dose level of bevacizumab has been investigated in 
patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent glioblastoma, i.e. a dose equivalent to 5mg/kg/week. 
The rationale for the use of Avastin in combination with the Stupp regimen has not been satisfactorily 
explained by the applicant.  
Cao et al. have shown that in non-enhancing tumour regions, the uptake of gadolinium-based contrast 
agents peaks 3-4 weeks into chemo radiotherapy treatment. In this time period the BBB/BTB 
disruption is most significant and likely the period with most delivery of temozolomide. Three months 
after RT the effect of RT on gadolinium-uptake is no longer apparent and the delivery of temozolomide 
is expected to be significantly reduced. Bevacizumab is a much larger molecule than temozolomide and 
the question remains how bevacizumab can be delivered across the BBB/BTB when the effect of 
radiotherapy subsides. In addition, bevacizumab has been shown to delay enhancement with 
gadolinium, reflecting reduced leakage into tumour thought to be due to stabilizing effects of 
bevacizumab. How bevacizumab is delivered to the tumour after the BBB/BTB has been stabilized is 
yet to be explained. This effect of bevacizumab may also reduce the delivery of temozolomide.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
BO21990 (Avaglio) study was a randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo controlled phase III trial 
investigating the efficacy and safety of adding bevacizumab to the Stupp regimen. The Stupp regimen, 
consists of radiation therapy (RT) and concomitant temozolomide (TMZ), as well as maintenance 
treatment with temozolomide.

Limitations regarding radiological assessment (RA) of tumour progression in patients with glioblastoma 
have been debated in the scientific literature. Pseudo progression is a phenomenon related to oedema 
and necrosis with temozolomide and radiation which may appear as progressions on images. Pseudo 
response, i.e. a response seen very rapidly after start of treatment has been observed with 
antiangiogenic therapy in glioblastoma. It has been suggested that this is due to a normalization of the 
blood-brain barrier which reduces the gadolinium-enhancement. This lack of enhancement may be 
wrongly assessed as a decrease in tumour size, i.e. the tumour may be stable or even progressing. 
Thus on one hand pseudo progression with RT/T may have led to underestimation of PFS in the control 
arm and on the other hand pseudo response with antiangiogenic treatment may have led to an 
overestimation of PFS in the bevacizumab arm.  
In the Avaglio study, radiological tumour assessments were performed using MRI. To assess 
progression a set of adapted Macdonald criteria was used, with MRI methodology that was predicted to 
capture enhancing (Gd-T1 sequence) and non-enhancing tumours (FLAIR/T2) as well as neurological 
deterioration + corticosteroid use. These criteria are in line with the RANO criteria released while the 
Avaglio study was under progress.  
However, FLAIR/T2 method has its limitations since variations in FLAIR/T2 images are difficult to 
quantitatively assess [Chinot et al].  Non-enhancing tumours may also be indicative of infiltrative 
tumours. These may be difficult to differentiate from oedema, gliosis or treatment related 
leukoencephalopathy. With this method it is not clear whether bevacizumab actually influences tumour 
development or its effect is just a physiological change in the tumour surroundings.  
In addition, conclusion on PD was taken at the end of the 4 week treatment break following the 
concomitant treatment phase which is considered very early and not in line with clinical practice. This 
method only takes into consideration early pseudo progression, and does not account for later pseudo 
progressions which may occur months after chemo radiotherapy [de Wit et al]. Although an algorithm 
was implemented in the Avaglio trial protocol in an attempt to address bias in terms of 
pseudoprogression (PsPD), this is considered inadequate since PsPD can occur at later time point 
during the treatment and premature declaration of PD based on a single scan was possible. In addition, 
Bv induced pseudo-response (and delayed progression) was not accounted for at all in the Avaglio 
trial.  
No confirmatory scan was required for determination of PD and patients were taken off treatment after 
one scan showing progression. In cases of suspected PsPD, only one additional scan was required to 
decide on progression and termination of therapy. Since PsPD may be counteracted by VEGF 
treatment, PsPD was most frequently determined in the control arm, and consequently many patients 
in the control arm may have been sub-treated with temozolomide. With the limitations of the imaging 
techniques as previously mentioned, pseudo-response in the bevacizumab arm was not sufficiently 
controlled for. Thus the effect of bevacizumab may have been overestimated while patients in the 
control arm may have performed poorer than otherwise expected. The radiological component was the 
most common source leading to PD determination whether alone (≈55%) or accompanied by 
neurological deterioration (≈28%), while only a minor part of PD events were based on neurological 
deterioration without radiological PD. Considering the uncertainties regarding RA outlined above it 
would seem reassuring that the neurological component was part of the decision for a large part of the 
patients with PD. However, information provided by the applicant regarding the order of assessment of 
neurological function and radiological assessment reduces the reliability of the neurological 
assessment; i.e. for the majority of the patients neurological assessment (NA) was performed after the 
day of RA or at the same day. The investigators may well have been influenced by the results of the 
RA when assessing NA. Whether the investigator’s evaluation of the patient’s neurological function was 
made with or without knowledge of the radiological results was not recorded.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The final analysis of PFS demonstrated a statistically significant 36% reduction in the risk of 
progression or death in the absence of prior progression for patients in the Bv+RT/TMZ arm compared 
to the Pl+RT/TMZ arm with an increase in median PFS of 4.4 months (HR 0.64, 95%CI 0.55-0.74; 
p<0.0001; median 10.6 vs. 6.2 months). However, the clinical relevance of the PFS is questionable in 
view of methodological problems associated with PFS in glioblastoma and with this type of product (see 
discussion above). 
No improvement in OS has been demonstrated with the addition of bevacizumab to RT/T. Arguably, 
this may be due to cross-over at the time of progression. A number of exploratory analyses were 
attempted to address these issue (data not shown). However, it is difficult to draw any conclusions 
from such types of analyses because in the majority of cases they may be biased by patient selection.  
Corticosteroid use has been reduced with the addition of bevacizumab. However, the clinical relevance 
of this reduction seems limited considering the relatively low dose level. The reason for the reduction 
may be that the tumour mass is reduced and the need for corticosteroids is diminished. However, it 
may be that bevacizumab acts as a substitution for corticosteroids since bevacizumab is known to 
reduce oedema surrounding the tumour.  
No detrimental effect was found in Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) during treatment with 
bevacizumab. However, assessment of this endpoint included PD as an event and assessments were 
not continued beyond progression. In addition, these analyses are not able to document whether there 
is a difference in HRQoL between early and late progressors. Signs and symptoms of the disease were 
collected in a subset of the patients (N=252) and did not reveal any significant differences between the 
treatment arms during treatment, and at the time of PD the majority of the patients reported no signs 
and symptoms. In both arms nearly all patients had stable or improved KPS. As for HRQoL, signs and 
symptom of the disease were evaluated until PD, while KPS was also evaluated beyond PD. KPS score 
showed a decline at PD. However, the number of patients evaluated at and after PD was limited. 
Furthermore, the evaluation of HRQoL was performed by the investigator, and is likely to be biased by 
the investigator’s knowledge of the disease assessment at PD. In conclusion, data on quality of life 
secondary endpoints demonstrated that bevacizumab does not have a detrimental effect on the 
patient’s quality of life while on treatment. However, it cannot be concluded based on these analyses 
that bevacizumab treated patients have a better outcome in quality of life related endpoints than 
patients who are not treated with bevacizumab. 
The  publicly  available  results  from  RTOG0825  study  were  submitted  and  analyzed  in  relation  to  the 
BO21990  (Avaglio)  results.  Even  though  there  are  some  methodological  differences  between  these 
trials, the results are similar. Therefore RTOG0825 study seems to confirm that adding bevacizumab to 
RT/TMZ  improves  radiologically  determined  PFS  without  any  improvement  in  overall  survival.  In 
addition, neurocognitive functioning deterioration was observed during treatment with bevacizumab. 
The applicant has performed biomarker analyses to determine if plasma VEGF-A or other plasma or 
tumour biomarkers has predictive value in PFS. None of the biomarkers included in these analyses can 
be concluded as predictive of treatment effect of bevacizumab. An extensive biomarker program for 
Avastin across indications is on-going.  
Additional expert consultation 
Following the CHMP request, a Scientific Advisory Group meeting was convened on 8 January 2014 to 
provide advice on the following list of questions: 
Avastin  
EMA/CHMP/268580/2014 
Page 49/75 
 
 
 
 
1. Please discuss the possible impact of the methodological limitations of neuro-imaging of 
brain tumours by MRI on the determination of progressive disease.  
 
 
Is it likely that the PFS estimate is biased by PsPD induced by TMZ and 
pseudoresponse induced by bevacizumab?  
Is Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) or T2-weighted sequences as used in 
the AvaGlio adequate to detect invasive/infiltrative tumour development?  
The SAG concluded that there is a likely and non-negligible bias due to a number of factors, in 
particular the mechanism of action of bevacizumab, which may influence tumor environment and 
integrity of the blood-brain barrier and may interfere with the assessment of tumor response. 
The FLAIR method cannot be considered adequate because changes in MRI may represent other 
conditions, in particular oedema and gliosis, and are therefore not specific to the tumor. Furthermore, 
repeated imaging with FLAIR, T2-weighted and contrast enhanced T1-weighted MRI from multiple 
institutions are sensitive to variations in image acquisition routines, scanner hardware and operator 
measurement bias that limits reproducibility. Therefore, although conventional imaging is used in 
clinical practice to guide treatment decisions, it does not constitute a reliable method to confirm the 
efficacy of new agents in glioblastoma, particularly VEGF inhibitors. Indeed, even in exploratory 
studies, overall survival is the preferred endpoint (EORTC experience). 
The algorithm implemented to address the bias in terms of pseudo-progression cannot eliminate this 
bias completely and cannot address important likely bias in terms of pseudo-response (and delayed 
progression) that is likely to be associated with bevacizumab. 
This bias may also impact on the reliability of secondary endpoints related to HR-QoL, as it not possible 
to rule out knowledge of the status of progression prior to completion of the QoL questionnaires 
(despite valid efforts to minimize such bias). For similar reasons, the fact that progression was 
associated with a slight decrease in HR-QoL cannot be used to establish the clinical relevance of the 
PFS endpoint. 
Furthermore, in terms of secondary HR-QoL endpoints, the effect of bevacizumab was similar to 
placebo or was of small magnitude. Also, there were general methodological issues with this secondary 
endpoint such as multiplicity and missing data (despite the relatively high compliance and valid efforts 
to minimize such methodological issues). 
Although the PFS endpoint included clinical components (worsening of neurological symptoms or 
increased corticosteroid used), similar biases might have affected these endpoints since the vast 
majority of events included radiological progression, which also was the only criterion for progression 
in the majority of cases. Also, longer follow-up after progression is lacking and it is not possible to 
assess the reversibility of the worsening in neurological symptoms or corticosteroid use. 
Lastly, the long survival observed for a significant number of patients with early progression is 
counterintuitive and possibly a further indication of the lack of clinical meaningfulness of the PFS 
endpoint in this disease.  
2.  Is the improvement in PFS of approximately 4 months of clinical relevance when seen in 
light of the results of the analyses of OS, HRQL and corticosteroid use? Please discuss the 
outcome of the AvaGlio study also in the context of the RTOG0825 study results.  
Regardless of the size of the effect observed, the clinical relevance of the PFS endpoint is questionable 
in view of methodological problems associated with PFS in this disease and with this type of product 
(see answer to question No. 1). The magnitude of the observed effect is not of such an extent that the 
methodological problems can be considered negligible.  Additionally, there is no clinically meaningful 
Avastin  
EMA/CHMP/268580/2014 
Page 50/75 
 
 
 
 
effect that has been established on the basis of other clinically relevant endpoints such as OS or HR-
QoL, to corroborate the claimed efficacy.  
It is also difficult to discuss the outcome of the AvaGlio study in the context of the RTOG0825 study 
results because for the latter, results are only available in the format of publicly available 
presentations. Nevertheless, the claimed results from the RTOG0825 study appear consistent, i.e., no 
effect on overall survival and no benefit in terms of QoL, possibly even a detriment (neurocognitive 
functioning). However, although it would most likely not bring supportive evidence of efficacy, detailed 
results from the RTOG0825 study would need to be assessed (e.g., in the format of a study report, 
even if abridged) and, specifically, the methodology used in the trial before being able to compare the 
results from the two studies. Therefore, the SAG recommended that CHMP should assess the RTOG 
study. 
3. Please discuss the possible impact of first line treatment with bevacizumab on the 
efficacy of subsequent post-progression therapy.  
A possible impact on the efficacy of further line therapies is not a major concern, due to the fact that 
the size of the effect associated with second-line treatments is debatable. The theoretical possibility 
that treatment with bevacizumab might select more aggressive tumors remains theoretical, at least in 
this indication, based on the lack of an important detriment in overall survival associated with 
bevacizumab in this large study. 
4. Is the safety profile of the proposed treatment regimen acceptable for the intended 
patient population?  
Bevacizumab was associated with increased toxicity, including Serious Adverse Events and fatal 
events. However, in view of the high unmet need in this indication, the toxicity associated with 
bevacizumab did not raise major concerns, at least in principle. However, in the absence of an 
established and clinically meaningful effect, the additional toxicity associated with bevacizumab cannot 
be considered acceptable.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In conclusion, there are issues regarding the radiological diagnosis of PD in this disease setting which 
question the clinical relevance and interpretation of the observed difference in PFS. This difference is 
not supported by prolonged overall survival. Secondary efficacy endpoints including HRQoL, KPS, 
corticosteroid use and changes in signs and symptoms of GMB did not provide evidence in support of a 
clinical benefit of bevacizumab treatment. Overall, the efficacy of bevacizumab in the proposed 
indication has not been demonstrated. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The Safety Analysis Population (SAP) comprised all randomized patients who received at least one dose 
of study treatment; 447 patients in the Pl+RT/T arm and 464 patients in the Bv+RT/T arm. Of 921 
patients randomized, 10 patients were excluded from the SAP because they did not receive a dose of 
study treatment (4 from the Pl+RT/T arm and 6 from the Bv+RT/T arm). The 911 patients included in 
the SAP were assigned to treatment arms according to the treatment actually received; 12 of 463 
patients randomized to the Pl+RT/T arm received at least one dose of Bv and had their safety 
considered as part of the Bv+RT/T arm. 
Avastin  
EMA/CHMP/268580/2014 
Page 51/75 
 
 
 
 
All AEs and SAEs occurring after initiation of study treatment were collected up to 90 days following 
the last dose of study treatment, regardless of causality. Adverse events of special interest (AESI), 
specified in the protocol as of particular interest for Bv safety were collected up to 6 months following 
the last dose of study treatment. SAEs that were considered to be related to study treatment had to be 
reported regardless of the time elapsed since last dose of study treatment.  
The safety analyses presented for Study BO21990 are based on data collected up to a clinical cut-off 
date of 31 March 2012. This cut-off date was based on the protocol-specified final PFS analysis with 
interim OS.

Bv treatment is always given at a fixed dose; 10 mg/kg once every two weeks (q2w) in the 
maintenance phase. However, for the TMZ in the maintenance phase, there was given the opportunity 
to escalate or reduce the dose according to defined tolerability criteria. The proportion of patients who 
were able to dose escalate TMZ was higher in the Bv+RT/T arm (41.3% vs.34.8%) than in the placebo 
arm. A higher proportion of patients in the Bv arm also completed the 6 cycles of TMZ than in the 
placebo arm (64% vs. 37%). 
Adverse events  
System Organ Class with a ≥ 10% higher incidence rate of AEs (any grade) in the Bv+RT/T arm 
compared to the Pl+RT/T arm were as follows: Gastrointestinal disorders (78% vs. 68%), infections 
and infestations (52% vs. 38%), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (46% vs. 30%), 
respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (45% vs. 25%), vascular disorders (46% vs. 21%) and 
renal and urinary disorders (23% vs. 13%). A summary of adverse events (all Grades) with an 
incidence of ≥ 10% in either treatment arm is presented in Table 31 below.

presented in Table 32.

(Safety Population) 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Bleeding  
Overall, an increase in bleeding events seen in the Bv+RT/T arm was primarily accounted for by grade 
1-2  events,  the  majority  of  which  were  manageable  mucocutaneous  bleeding  events  that  resolved 
without specific intervention:  
Mucocutaneous bleeding events were more common in the Bv+RT/T arm (124 [26.7%] vs. 40 [8.9%]). 
Nearly  all  mucocutaneous  bleeding  events  were  grade  1  or  2.  Two  events  (epistaxis),  both  in  the 
Bv+RT/T arm, were grade ≥ 3. These grade ≥ 3 bleeding events were treated with platelet transfusions 
and subsequently resolved.  
Avastin  
EMA/CHMP/268580/2014 
Page 54/75 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Events coded under the ‘‘cerebral haemorrhage’’ grouping occurred in a similar number of patients in 
each arm (12 [2.6%] Bv+RT/T vs. 10 [2.2%] Pl+RT/T). While the events in the Bv+RT/T arm tended 
to be more severe, the difference in the treatment arms was due to the occurrence of strokes (CVA), 
most of which were determined after medical review to be of ischemic origin.  
Bleeding events at other sites (other than mucocutaneous or cerebral) occurred more frequently in the 
Bv+RT/T arm (54 [11.6%] vs. 36 [8.1%]), with the increase driven primarily by grade 1-2 events.  
Arterial Thromboembolic Events (ATEs) 
The overall incidence of ATEs (any grade) was higher in the Bv+RT/T arm than in the Pl+RT/T arm (23 
[5.0%] vs. 7 [1.6%], respectively) as was the incidence of grade ≥ 3 ATEs (19 [4.1%] vs 6 [1.3%]). 
One ATE event in each group was fatal (CVA in the Pl+RT/T arm and MI in the Bv+RT/T arm). ATEs led 
to  discontinuation  of  Pl/Bv  therapy  for  more  patients  in  the  Bv+RT/T  arm  (13  patients)  than  in  the 
Pl+RT/T arm (1 patient). The majority of ATE events in the Bv arm resolved with treatment (Table 33). 
Table 33. Summary of Arterial Thromboembolic Events (Safety Population) 
Medical review of all ATE events identified that most of the ATE terms can be grouped under the broad 
medical concept of “stroke” or cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) (Table x) and that most of the strokes 
were of ischemic origin. Thus, 16 of 23 patients in the Bv+RT/T arm and 6 of 7 patients in the Pl+RT/T 
Avastin  
EMA/CHMP/268580/2014

arm  with  an  ATE  experienced  a  stroke.  The  non-stroke  ATE  events  included  MI,  peripheral  arterial 
occlusive disease, embolism, stress cardiomyopathy, and thrombotic microangiopathy.

Population) 
__________________________________________________________________ 
________________________________________________________________ 
Venous Thromboembolic Events (VTEs) 
The  overall  incidence  of  VTEs  was  similar  in  both  arms:  any  grade,  36  [7.8%]  Bv  vs.  43  [9.6%]  Pl; 
Grade ≥ 3, 34 [7.3%] Bv vs. 36 [8.1%] Pl. There were four fatal events, all of which were pulmonary 
embolism  (1  Pl+RT/T  and  3  Bv+RT/T).  Similar  numbers  of  patients  discontinued  Pl/Bv  treatment  or 
dose modified for VTE events in each arm. The VTE events resolved in a higher proportion in patients 
in the Bv+RT/T arm (24/36; 67%) than in the Pl+RT/T arm (21/43; 49%). 
Wound Healing Complications 
Wound healing complications (WHC) were more frequently reported by Bv-treated patients (17 [3.7%]) 
than by Pl-treated patients (10 [2.2%]). Seven patients in the Bv+RT/T arm reported grade ≥ 3 WHC 
events compared with three in the Pl+RT/T arm. The majority of WHC events resolved with treatment. 
All grade ≥ 3 wound healing complications were related to the craniotomy site. 
There was one fatal wound infection in a Bv-treated patient who had developed a post-operative cyst 
prior  to  study  start.  On  Day  360,  during  the  Monotherapy  Phase  of  the  study,  the  patient  developed 
Grade 3 head wound infection leading to hospitalization. The patient died on Day 384 reportedly after 
stopping antibiotic therapy and following discharge from the hospital.  
Six patients in the Bv+RT/T arm discontinued therapy due to WHC compared with none in the Pl+RT/T 
arm.  Three  patients  in  the  Bv+RT/T  arm  and  2  patients  in  the  Pl+RT/T  arm  had  the  scheduled 
de-bulking  surgery  within  four  weeks  of  starting  trial  treatment.  None  of  these  patients  experienced 
significant post-operative wound-healing complications.

Hypertension 
Hypertension  was  reported  as  an  AE  more  frequently  in  the  Bv+RT/T  arm  than  in  the  Pl+RT/T  arm 
(any  grade:  174  [37.5%]  vs.  58  [13.0%]  patients;  grade  3:  48 [10.3%]  vs.  9  [2.0%]  patients, 
respectively).  Hypertension  was  reported  as  resolved  in  the  majority  (>70%)  of  cases.  Four  patients 
required discontinuation of Bv therapy.  
Proteinuria 
A higher proportion of patients reported proteinuria as an AE in the Bv+RT/T arm than in the Pl+RT/T 
arm  (any  grade:  65  [14.0%]  vs.  18  [4.0%];  Grade  3/4,  17  [3.7%]  vs.  0  [0.0%],  respectively). 
Proteinuria  resolved  without  specific  treatment  in  the  majority  of  cases;  however,  14  patients 
discontinued  Bv  treatment  due  to  proteinuria.  One  Bv-treated  patient  developed  grade  4  nephrotic 
syndrome, which resolved with treatment. 
Non-GI Abscesses and Fistulae 
Five patients developed a non-GI abscess or fistula, 3 (0.6%) in the Bv+RT/T arm and 2 (0.4%) in the 
Pl+RT/T arm. All events were grade 3 except for one grade 4 event in the Bv+RT/T arm. All the events 
resolved with treatment. Two patients in each arm withdrew from Bv/Pl therapy for the event. 
GI Perforation, Abscesses and Fistulae 
Eight (1.7%) patients in the Bv+RT/T arm and one patient (0.2%) in the Pl+RT/T arm experienced a 
‘‘GI perforation’’ event (including GI abscesses and fistulae). Five of the 8 events in the Bv+RT/T arm 
were grade ≥  3 (including one fatal large intestine perforation). Including the patient who died, three 
patients  in  the  Bv  arm  discontinued  Bv  due  to  the  event.  Six  of  the  seven  non-fatal  events  had 
resolved  with  treatment  at  the  time  of  the  analysis.  The  event  in  the  Pl+RT/T  arm  (large  intestine 
perforation) was grade 4 in severity, led to discontinuation of all study treatment, and was unresolved 
at time of the data cut. 
Congestive Heart Failure 
Three  patients  had  a  CHF  AE;  2  in  the  Bv+RT/T  arm  and  1  in  the  Pl+RT/T  arm.  Both  events  in  the 
Bv+RT/T arm were grade 3 whereas a CTC grade was not assigned for the event in the Pl+RT/T arm. 
One patient in the Bv arm discontinued study treatment due to the event. The CHF had resolved at the 
time of the clinical cut-off for the patient in the Pl arm and for the patient who discontinued in the Bv 
arm, but was still unresolved at the time of the data cut for the second Bv-treated patient.  
Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) 
There were no reports of PRES in either treatment arm at the time of the clinical cut-off.  
Other Selected AEs 
Thrombocytopenia and infections were selected post hoc for further analysis since, apart from the 
AESIs, these were clinically relevant AEs that had a clearly increased overall incidence in the Bv+RT/T 
arm compared to the Pl+RT/T arm. 
Thrombocytopenia 
The overall incidence of thrombocytopenia AEs (all grades) was higher in the Bv+RT/T arm (154 
[33.2%]) than in the Pl+RT/T arm (122 [27.3%]). The incidence of grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia AEs 
was also higher with Bv than with Pl treatment (67 [14.4%] vs. 44 [9.8%]), but was not associated 
with clinically significant (grade ≥ 3) bleeding events. Discontinuation of treatment because of 
thrombocytopenia was balanced between the arms (Bv+RT/T 14 [3.0%]; Pl+RT/T 15 [3.4%], but the 
number of patients with dose modification/interruption/delay was slightly increased in the Bv+RT/T

Infections 
Overall incidence (All treatment phases) 
The overall incidence of infections was higher in the Bv+RT/T arm than in the Pl+RT/T arm (241 [52%] 
vs. 170 [38%] patients, respectively). The same was true for grade ≥ 3 infections (56 [12.1%] vs. 34 
[7.6%] patients, respectively). The number of fatal (grade 5) infection AEs (occurring during treatment 
or within 90 days of last dose), however, was similar in both groups (8 [1.7%] vs. 7 [1.6%] patients, 
respectively). The total number of fatal infections during the study including post-treatment survival 
follow-up was also similar in each group (10 [2.2%] vs. 12 [2.7%] patients, respectively. 
Time to onset of infection 
The data over the first 3 months of the study indicate no overall increased risk of infection with the 
addition of Bv to RT/T during the Concurrent Phase. 
After 3 months, the curves of time to onset of infection separate, with the incidence higher in the 
Bv+RT/T arm. This pattern is not seen for grade ≥ 3 infections, for which the incidence is only slightly 
higher in the Bv+RT/T arm through the concurrent and maintenance phases of the study up to 
6 months. Thus, the difference in incidence over the first 6 months is largely driven by grade 1 and 2 
infections occurring during the Maintenance Phase of the study, after the TMZ dose could have been 
escalated (i.e., between months 3 to 4). Since more patients in the Bv+RT/T arm dose escalated and 
completed the maintenance phase of treatment this could account for an increased number of events 
in the Bv+RT/T arm relative to the Pl+RT/T arm.  
Beyond 6 months, greater numbers of patients were still being followed in the Bv+RT/T arm than in 
the Pl+RT/T arm. The higher overall incidence of grade ≥ 3 AEs of infection in the Bv+RT/T arm 
appears to be due to AEs with an onset in this later phase of the study and may be related to 
prolonged treatment exposure and observation in the Bv+RT/T arm. 
Sites of Infection 
The grade ≥ 3 infection AEs included most commonly respiratory tract infections for which there was no 
clear  overall  imbalance  across  groups.  The  incidence  of  grade ≥ 3  sepsis  (PTs:  sepsis,  septic  shock, 
neutropenic  sepsis,  bacteremia,  urosepsis)  was  higher  in  the  Bv+RT/T  arm  (6  events)  than  in  the 
Pl+RT/T  arm  (1 event),  as  was  the  occurrence  of  grade ≥ 3  events  reported  as  wound  infections  (six 
events, all in the Bv+RT/T arm, all post-operative cranial wounds) and skin infections (6 events vs. 1 
event).  There was no clear imbalance in grade ≥ 3 infections at other sites.

Serious adverse events 
The summary of the most frequent SAEs is summarized in Table 38. 
The incidence of AEs reported as serious was higher in the Bv+RT/T arm (36.6% of patients reported 
at least one SAE, total of 259 SAEs) than in the Pl+RT/T arm (25.7%, 156 SAEs).

Laboratory findings 
There was a higher incidence of newly occurring Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities for 
haematological tests in the Bv+RT/T arm compared with the Pl+RT/T arm. In line with the AE data, the 
incidence of grade 4 thrombocytopenia (low platelet counts) was higher in the Bv+RT/T arm than in 
the Pl+RT/T arm (39 [8%] vs. 15 [3%]). Other test results appeared to be balanced between the 
treatment arms. 
Vital Signs 
Consistent with the increased incidence of hypertension reported as an AE in Bv-treated patients small 
increases from pre-treatment baseline values were observed at the last visit in the Bv+RT/T arm for 
diastolic (DBP) and systolic (SBP) blood pressure. No notable changes were observed in the Pl+RT/T 
arm. Median changes from baseline in DBP and SBP at the last visit were 3.0 and 4.0 mmHg, 
respectively, in the Bv+RT/T arm compared with 0.0 and -1.5 mmHg, respectively, in the Pl+RT/T 
arm. 
Electrocardiograms 
Twelve-lead ECGs were recorded at screening and thereafter as clinically indicated and at the 90-day 
safety follow-up visit. Very few patients had an abnormal ECG result and those who did generally had 
the abnormal result prior to initiation of study treatment. Approximately 2% of patients with a normal 
ECG result at baseline had an abnormal result after initiation of treatment (8/464 [1.7%] Bv+RT/T vs. 
11/447 [2.5%] Pl+RT/T).  
Safety in special populations 
Age 
In general there seems to be more AEs in the Bv+RT/T group when compared to placebo, and slightly 
more AEs in the ≥ 65 years group.  Most striking is the higher rate of cerebral haemorrhage, grade 
3/4/5 AEs and serious AEs in the ≥65 year group. Furthermore, there is in general a higher 
discontinuation rate due to AE in patients receiving bevacizumab. There also seems to be higher death 
rate for patients over ≥ 65 years receiving placebo. Most concerning is the clinically relevant difference 
in grade 3/4/5 AEs seen between Bv+RT/T and Pl+RT/T, and between ‹65 years and ≥ 65 years. 
Sex 
With  regard  to  general  AEs  there  seems  to  be  slightly  more  AEs  in  females  compared  to  males  and 
more AEs in the Bv+RT/T group. Males seem to have higher and similar death rate in both treatment 
groups. Looking at AESI to bevacizumab the event rates are comparable between males and females in 
the bevacizumab group. 
Race 
Since most patients were white, no comparison between different races has been made. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Overall, a higher proportion of patients in the Bv+RT/T arm (24.6%) than in the Pl+RT/T arm (13.2%) 
discontinued any component of treatment because of AEs. The most common AEs that led to 
withdrawal of treatment in both treatment arms were thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, both of 
which are recognized as dose limiting toxicities for TMZ. The increased incidence in the Bv treatment 
arm was attributable to AEs in the following SOCs: 
Avastin  
EMA/CHMP/268580/2014 
Page 64/75 
 
 
 
 
•  Infections  and  infestations  (21  [4.5%]  vs.  8  [1.8%])  –  including  6  wound  infections  in  Bv-treated 
patients vs. none on placebo 
•  Nervous  system  disorders  (15  [3.2%])  vs.  6  [1.3%])  –  including  5  CVAs  in  the  Bv+TR/T  arm  vs. 
none in the Pl+RT/T arm 
• Renal disorders (15 [3.2%] vs. none) – 13 proteinuria, 1 nephrotic syndrome, 1 acute renal failure 
• General disorders (7 [1.5%] vs. none) – including pyrexia (3), fatigue (2) 
• Neoplasm SOC - the difference due to tumour haemorrhage (7 [1.5%] vs. none) 
• Cardiac disorders (4 [0.9%] vs. none) – 2 MI,1 CHF,1 coronary artery stenosis 
A higher proportion of patients in the Bv+RT/T arm (51.7%) than in the Pl+RT/T arm (37.4%) 
modified any component of treatment because of an AE. The most common reasons were 
haemotoxicity (primarily thrombocytopenia), vascular disorders (primarily hypertension) and 
infections, all of which led to dose modifications in a higher proportion of patients in the Bv+RT/T arm. 
Of the less common reasons ( ≤ 5% patients in either arm), proteinuria led to dose modification in 
notably more patients on Bv treatment (3.0% vs. 0.4%).  
Considering individual components of trial treatment, the proportion of patients experiencing an AE 
leading to dose interruption/delay or discontinuation of Bv/Pl was higher in the Bv+RT/T arm than in 
the Pl+RT/T arm. The same was true for AEs leading to dose modification/interruption/delay or 
discontinuation of TMZ. The increased incidence was mainly attributable to thrombocytopenia, 
hypertension, and infections for Bv/Pl and to thrombocytopenia for TMZ. 
A minority of patients in both arms required interruption or discontinuation of their radiotherapy 
treatment due to an AE (Pl+RT/T 19 [4.3%] vs. Bv+RT/T 28 [6.0%]). The SOCs most frequently 
affected were nervous system, infections, and blood and lymphatic disorders, with no major imbalance 
between arms in any particular type of AE. 
Post marketing experience 
Bevacizumab in combination with intravenous 5-fluorouracil–based chemotherapy for the first-line 
treatment of patients with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum was approved in the United 
States on 26 February 2004 and in the European Union on 12 January 2005. During the 8-year period 
from 26 February 2004 to 25 February 2012, a total of 53586 AEs, of which 44427 were serious, were 
reported in 28252 patients (2.1%).  In 3411 cases (0.3%), the outcome was fatal.  Overall, the 
incidence of patients reporting AEs, the proportion of AEs considered serious, and the incidence of 
patients with AEs leading to death has remained stable over this period. 
The most frequently reported SAEs in patients treated with bevacizumab during the reporting period 
26 February 2011 to 25 February 2012 were GI disorders (19.0%), general disorders and 
administration site conditions (10.5%), and infections and infestations (9.2%). 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The overall exposure and the extent of the safety database are considered satisfactory for the 
evaluation of safety. 
A higher proportion of patients in the Bv arm were able to both dose escalate TMZ (41.3% vs. 34.8%) 
and to complete the planned 6 cycles of TMZ (64% vs. 37%) compared to the placebo arm, i.e. there 
was a greater exposure to TMZ therapy in the Bv arm. The difference in the number of patients 
completing the scheduled 6 cycles of TMZ was primarily due to more patients in the Pl+RT/T arm 
Avastin  
EMA/CHMP/268580/2014 
Page 65/75 
 
 
 
 
discontinuing due to PD, not primarily due to toxicity. These data indicate that the addition of Bv did 
not adversely affect the overall tolerability of the TMZ regimen. The follow-up period for safety 
assessment was approximately 4 months longer in the Bv arm than in the placebo arm, and both the 
higher exposure to study medication and duration may explain the differences in incidences of AEs 
observed across the treatment arms in this study. 
Overall, there is a higher incidence of AEs in the Bv+RT/TMZ group. The AEs occurred in a pattern that 
reflected the safety profile of bevacizumab.  These are primarily hypertension, epistaxis, proteinuria, 
constipation, vomiting, headache, arthralgia, and blood and lymphatic disorders. Higher incidences of 
grade ≥ 3 adverse events were also seen in the mentioned SOCs/PTs in the Bv+RT/T group.  
The incidence of SAEs was higher in the Bv (Bv+RT/TMZ) arm (36.6%) than in the Placebo (RT/TMZ) 
arm (25.7%), and was due partly to increased incidences of serious AESI, but also explained by higher 
incidences of infections (mainly pneumonia and sepsis) and thrombocytopenia. SAEs assessed as 
related to study treatment were also higher in the Bv arm than in the Placebo am (23.9% vs.14.1%, 
respectively) and the increased incidence in the Bv arm was primarily attributable to AESIs, 
thrombocytopenia and infections. 
With regard to AESI, arterial thromboembolic events, mainly ischaemic strokes, were observed at a 
slightly higher incidence rate in this trial (5.0%) than in previous Bv trials (up to 3.8% in combination 
with different chemotherapies), and higher than in the Pl+RT/TMZ arm (1.6%). The potentially 
increased risk of ATEs elderly Bv-treated patients is reflected in the occurrence of more strokes in the 
elderly subgroup (≥ 65 years). A review of all cases of ATEs showed that the majority of the patients 
had co-morbidities or risk-factors.  
The overall incidence of infections was higher in the Bv arm than in the Pl arm (52% vs. 38%). The 
same was true for grade ≥ 3 infections (12.1% vs. 7.6%). There was no single SAE with more than 2% 
increased incidence in the Bv arm compared to the placebo arm, but as a group, analyzed for the SOC 
‘Infections and infestations’ overall, there were more serious infections in the Bv arm than in the Pl 
arm (10.6% vs. 6,5%), the most commonly reported terms were pneumonia and sepsis.  
At clinical cut-off date, 56% of patients had died in the Bv arm compared with 57% patients in the 
placebo arm, mainly due to disease progression. There was also a similar overall incidence of deaths 
not due to PD (non-PD deaths; 6.3% placebo vs. 5.4% Bv) in both treatment arms. However, there 
were differences in the timing of these non-PD deaths. During the actual treatment phases (or within 
90 days post treatment), there were more non-PD deaths in the Bv arm (22 deaths) than in the 
placebo arm (12 deaths). The most common non-PD related cause of death was infection, with similar 
incidences in both arms – and hence, cannot explain the observed difference in non-PD death rates 
between the Bv and the control arm. More non-PD deaths occurred in the Bv arm (11) than in the 
control arm (5) at an early stage, i.e. during the concurrent phase and the treatment break. Of these 
11 deaths in the Bv arm there were 3 confirmed or suspected thromboembolic events, one GI 
perforation and one haemorrhage, all of which could potentially be related to bevacizumab. No 
common pattern or risk factor associated with the early AEs leading to death was found. A causal 
relationship with bevacizumab cannot be excluded for these additional deaths. 
Additional expert consultations 
Following the CHMP request, a Scientific Advisory Group meeting was convened on 8 January 2014 to 
provide advice on the following question: 
Avastin  
EMA/CHMP/268580/2014 
Page 66/75 
 
 
 
 
1. Is the safety profile of the proposed treatment regimen acceptable for the intended 
patient population?  
Bevacizumab was associated with increased toxicity, including Serious Adverse Events and fatal 
events. However, in view of the high unmet need in this indication, the toxicity associated with 
bevacizumab did not raise major concerns, at least in principle. However, in the absence of an 
established and clinically meaningful effect, the additional toxicity associated with bevacizumab cannot 
be considered acceptable.  
2.5.3.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Bevacizumab has a well-known safety profile which includes hypertension, proteinuria, wound healing 
complications, mucocutanous bleeding, ATEs, VTEs, GI-perforations and fistula. These AEs were also 
observed in Avaglio.  
In combination with temozolomide and radiation there was also an increase in infections (52% vs 
38%), including pneumonia, sepsis and skin infections. A higher incidence of ATEs were reported 
among bevacizumab treated patients in Avaglio than previously reported for bevacizumab, and higher 
than in the control arm of Avaglio (5% vs 1.6%). There were overall more SAEs in the bevacizumab 
treated patients than in the control arm; 36.6% vs 25.7%. In addition, there were more non-PD 
deaths reported as Grade 5 AEs in the bevacizumab arm (22 [4.7%]) than in the control arm (12 
[2.7%]) with 11 and 5 out of these occurring in the early phase, i.e. within 70 days from 
randomisation. A causal relationship with bevacizumab cannot be excluded for these additional deaths. 
Overall the risks of adding bevacizumab to the RT/TMZ are associated with increased risk of infections, 
increased incidence of ATEs and increased non-PD deaths in addition to all the known safety concerns 
with Avastin.  
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The  assessment  of  efficacy  in  GBM  is  currently  based  on  OS  due  to  a  number  of  limitation  with  the 
radiological  endpoint  PFS.  Although  standard  methods  for  PFS  assessment  exist,  and  although  PFS  is 
used in clinical practice to make treatment decisions based on the totality of patient data, this endpoint 
cannot be considered to be a reliable endpoint to assess the efficacy of new cancer drugs, in particular, 
if belonging to the class of anti-VEGF drugs, as this further hampers radiological assessment of tumour 
size. 
In  the  pivotal  trial  presented  (Avaglio),  no  difference  in  OS  or  other  clinically  relevant  endpoint  has 
been  observed.  A  difference  in  PFS  has  been  observed  but  the  clinical  relevance  of  this  observation 
cannot be considered established. These results were similar to those observed in a similar phase III 
trial  (RTOG0825),  also  reporting  no  effect  on  OS  of  adding  bevacizumab  to  RT/T  whilst  observing 
deterioration of neurocognitive functioning. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
There are serious limitations with radiological assessment of tumour response in GBM patients treated 
with RT/TMZ and RT/TMZ+bev. Currently, PFS cannot be considered a reliable measure of clinically 
Avastin

relevant effect in this disease and class of product (see discussion on clinical efficacy and SAG 
responses).  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Bevacizumab has a well-known safety profile which includes hypertension, proteinuria, wound healing 
complications, mucocutanous bleeding, ATEs, VTEs, GI-perforations and fistula. These AEs were also 
observed in Avaglio.  
The incidence of SAEs was higher in the Bv (Bv+RT/TMZ) arm (36.6%) than in the Placebo (RT/TMZ) 
arm (25.7%), and was due partly to increased incidences of serious AESI, but also explained by higher 
incidences of infections (mainly pneumonia and sepsis) and thrombocytopenia. SAEs assessed as 
related to study treatment were also higher in the Bv arm than in the Placebo am (23.9% vs.14.1%, 
respectively) and the increased incidence in the Bv arm was primarily attributable to AESIs, 
thrombocytopenia and infections. 
With regard to AESI, arterial thromboembolic events, mainly ischaemic strokes, were observed at a 
slightly higher incidence rate in this trial (5.0%) than in previous Bv trials (up to 3.8% in combination 
with different chemotherapies), and higher than in the Pl+RT/TMZ arm (1.6%).  The overall incidence 
of infections was higher in the Bv arm than in the Pl arm (52% vs. 38%).  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
There were more non-PD deaths reported as Grade 5 AEs in the bevacizumab arm than in the control 
arm, i.e. 22 [4.7%] vs 12 [2.7%], respectively, with 11 and 5 out of these occurring in the early 
phase, i.e. within 70 days from randomisation. A causal relationship with bevacizumab cannot be 
excluded for these additional deaths. 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Based on the data presented, there was no clinically meaningful effect that has been established on 
the basis of clinically relevant endpoints such as overall survival or health-related quality of life. The 
claimed improvement in progression-free survival associated with the combination of bevacizumab+ 
RT/T compared to placebo +RT/T based on the Avaglio trial cannot be considered of clinical relevance 
in view of methodological problems associated with PFS in this disease and with this type of product.  
The bevacizumab + RT/T combination was associated with increased toxicity, including serious adverse 
events and fatal events. 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
In  the  absence  of  an  established  clinical  efficacy  or  other  clinically  relevant  benefits,  and  considering 
the significant toxicity of the combination of bevacizumab+ RT/T, the benefit-risk cannot be considered 
positive in the proposed indication.

Grounds for refusal: 
Whereas 
• 
The efficacy of bevacizumab in combination with radiotherapy and temozolomide for the treatment 
of adult patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma has not been sufficiently demonstrated; 
• 
In the absence of established efficacy, a positive benefit-risk balance has not been established.  
the CHMP on the grounds of Article 16 of Regulation 1234/2008/EC has recommended the refusal of 
the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation. 
Re-examination of the CHMP opinion of 22 May 2014 
Following the CHMP conclusion that the claimed indication in glioblastoma for Avastin was not 
approvable, the applicant submitted detailed grounds for the re-examination of the grounds for refusal.  
Detailed grounds for re-examination submitted by the applicant 
The applicant presented his rationale in writing and at an oral explanation. 
A summary of the applicant’s grounds for re-examination is presented below. 
Study methodology including imaging and disease assessment criteria:  The applicant considered that 
the pivotal study (Avaglio) was designed using standard methodology in GBM for the assessment of 
tumour growth and followed the current clinical practice. While the applicant acknowledged that there 
is an on-going evolution of the criteria used to assess disease progression in brain tumours, they 
contended that the criteria used in Avaglio study represent the most advanced and accepted 
technology in line with expert recommendations. Several strategies were applied prospectively in 
Avaglio in order to minimize the possibility of incorrectly interpreting the MRI scan including 
implementation of an algorithm for the determination of pseudo-progression. 
Reliability of PFS:  The applicant considered that the robustness and reliability of the primary analysis 
of PFS was confirmed in a number of predefined and post-hoc sensitivity analyses. Key post-hoc 
sensitivity analyses that took into account the concerns raised by the CHMP on the reliability of the 
imaging technique to detect disease progression excluded patients 1) with potential or confirmed 
pseudo-progression, 2) with possible pseudo-progression in the Pl+RT/T arm and possible pseudo-
response in the Bv+RT/T arm and 3) with PFS < Day 93 to avoid any potential impact of pseudo-
Avastin  
EMA/CHMP/268580/2014

progression and post-radiation imaging changes at the first disease assessment. The applicant 
provided an additional post-hoc PFS analysis where all progressions exclusively based on non-index 
lesions were not regarded as a PFS event.  
Finally, the applicant provided a post-hoc analysis in line with the RANO criteria (Wen et al., 2010), 
which are the current standard used in clinical trials. According to this analysis, 84% of the PFS events 
could be considered unequivocal. 
Clinical relevance of PFS:  The applicant considered that Avaglio study used a variety of validated and 
reliable measures to assess the clinical status that captured the patient’s perspective (health-related 
quality of life [HRQOL]), neurocognitive function (Mini Mental Status Examination [MMSE]), and 
functional status (Karnofsky Performance Status [KPS]). According to the applicant, the KPS results 
showed a delay in time to definitive deterioration in KPS in favour of bevacizumab irrespective of 
whether PD was included (pre-specified) or excluded (exploratory) as an event. At the time of disease 
progression, the data indicated a trend for deterioration in functional status and HRQoL compared to 
the assessments prior to progression, which underscores the clinical importance for the patients of 
delaying the time until disease progression. While the Applicant acknowledged that limited data was 
captured beyond the time of progression, they contended that this does not diminish the value of the 
data captured on study. 
Absence of OS benefit:  According to the applicant, the use of subsequent lines of therapy, that often 
included bevacizumab, may have confounded the result. The applicant concluded that despite the 
obvious flaws and biases of the exploratory survival analyses these analyses indicated a beneficial 
effect of bevacizumab. 
Overall conclusion on grounds for re-examination  
The CHMP assessed all the detailed grounds for re-examination and argumentations presented by the 
applicant. 
Regarding the MRI evaluation of disease progression, the CHMP maintained the view that the impact of 
the use of adapted criteria in Study BO21990 remains unclear. The number of PD events may have 
been overestimated in the placebo arm and underestimated in the bevacizumab arm. The applicant did 
not convincingly show that the sensitivity analyses performed were able to mitigate the risk of 
systematic biases in the evaluation of PFS and were adequate to provide sufficient reassurance that 
bevacizumab produces a PFS increase of clinically important magnitude. In particular, the applicant did 
not clearly justify how the criteria chosen to exclude specific patients or events in the various 
sensitivity analyses were able to address the biases/uncertainties around the assessment of 
progression. 
The results of the post hoc analysis according to the RANO criteria were not considered sufficiently 
robust to resolve the uncertainties around the PFS results. This analysis resulted in an estimated 
benefit of smaller magnitude, based on an analysis that, necessarily but problematically, introduces 
some informative censoring. All the additional analyses cannot exclude the possibility of important bias 
and the estimated effect is not regarded as sufficiently reliable to conclude that a clinically relevant 
therapeutic efficacy has been established. 
Thus, the CHMP maintained the view that it was not possible to estimate with sufficient confidence the 
magnitude of the gain in tumour control provided by bevacizumab when added to standard of care. 
Regarding clinical outcomes, the applicant proposed that only maintenance of QoL to the time of 
disease progression may be expected, and this can be accepted. However, the CHMP concluded that 
the positive effects claimed by the applicant are mainly driven by the inclusion of PD as an event in

these analyses, and therefore, they cannot provide independent support or insight into the clinical 
benefits of delaying progression. Nominally, statistically significant results were retained for some 
parameters when PD was not counted as a deterioration event. These analyses should be interpreted 
with caution since relevant data were not collected systematically after disease progression and the 
consequent impact of (potentially informative) censoring on the results is unclear. In addition, some 
assessments may have been influenced by knowledge of progression status. 
Concerning overall survival, the CHMP acknowledged that no OS benefit had been observed in Study 
BO21990, a finding consistent with the result of the RTOG 0825 trial. It has not been established that 
the most likely cause for the failure to demonstrate an OS benefit is confounded by post-progression 
treatments (including crossover to bevacizumab) rather than lack of an effect. 
In conclusion, as the clinical relevance of the efficacy results is uncertainthe benefit-risk balance of 
bevacizumab as an add-on therapy to standard of care for newly diagnosed glioblastoma is considered 
negative. 
Recommendations following re-examination 
Based on the arguments of the applicant and all the supporting data on safety and efficacy, the CHMP 
re-examined its initial opinion and in its final opinion concluded by majority decision that the efficacy of 
the above mentioned medicinal product is not sufficiently demonstrated, and, therefore maintains its 
recommendation for the refusal of the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation for the 
above mentioned medicinal product. The CHMP considers that: 
• 
The efficacy of bevacizumab in combination with radiotherapy and temozolomide for the treatment 
of adult patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma has not been sufficiently demonstrated; 
•    In the absence of established efficacy, a positive benefit-risk balance has not been established.

DIVERGENT POSITION EXPRESSED BY CHMP MEMBERS 
Some members of the CHMP expressed a divergent position as follows: 
Divergent opinion 
Efficacy 
The AVAglio study (BO21990) is a large randomized study that evaluates the effect of the addition of 
bevacizumab to standard radiotherapy–temozolomide for the treatment of newly diagnosed 
glioblastoma. The study was designed based on current best practices for disease assessment using 
MRI for tumour response and progression. Radiographic criteria were adapted to address specific 
concerns related to the effect of antiangiogenic therapy on imaging. Specifically, assessment of non-
enhancing tumor components was included, and a specific algorithm was used to assess 
pseudoprogression. These adaptations are consistent with current international consensus guidelines.  
The ITT analysis included 921 patients (463 in the placebo group and 458 in the bevacizumab group). 
Two co-primary endpoints (investigator-reported PFS and OS) were used. Median PFS was prolonged 
by 4.4 months, from 6.2 months (placebo) to 10.6 months (bevacizumab) whereas median OS was 
almost identical for the two treatment groups (16.6 months vs. 16.8 months). It should be noted that 
the PFS for the placebo group is consistent with the results of multiple studies using the Stupp regimen. 
The PFS gain was associated with diminished use of glucocorticoids, which may be a consequence of 
improved tumor control (reduced tumor mass) as well as the decreased permeability of tumor 
vasculature afforded by bevacizumab. More importantly, median time to KPS (Karnofsky Performance 
Status) deterioration > 20 points was prolonged from 5.5 months (placebo) to 9.0 months 
(bevacizumab). A KPS of 70 indicates that the patient is capable of self-care but is not able to perform 
normal activity or work. The median duration of KPS > 70 was 6 months (placebo) as compared to 9 
months (bevacizumab). This finding suggests that the PFS gain is associated with important clinical 
benefit to the patient and KPS assessment is independent of tumour measurement by MRI. The quality 
of life was maintained during the therapy with bevacizumab. The PFS endpoint was robust across all 
subgroups. 
It is acknowledged that MRI assessment of response and progression poses special challenges when 
antiangiogenic agents are included in treatment of GBM. Pseudoprogression is a phenomenon related 
to oedema and necrosis with temozolomide and radiation which may appear as progressions on images. 
Pseudoresponse, i.e. a response seen very rapidly after start of treatment has been observed with 
antiangiogenic therapy in glioblastoma. Several sensitivity analyses, as requested by the CHMP, all 
support the primary estimate. In a sensitivity analysis, where PDs only based on scans are excluded, 
the PFS estimate supports the primary estimate. As shown by the Applicant, to further investigate the 
concern with PsPD, a PFS subgroup analysis of patients who were progression-free for at least 93 days, 
showed a significant difference in favour of the bevacizumab arm. Another exploratory analysis 
excluding possible PsPD in the Pl+RT/T arm and pseudoresponse in the Bv+RT/T arm was also 
conducted. In the Bv+RT/T arm all patients without a response within the first 92 days after 
randomisation in the Bv+RT/T arm were included. In the Pl+RT/T arm only patients with a 
unmistakable PFS event in the first 92 days were included. The analysis shows  significant difference in 
favour of Bv+RT/T arm. 
The lack of OS benefit should not preclude an approval of a first-line therapy. The influence of 
subsequent therapies and cross-over from placebo to bevacizumab may have confounded the OS co-
primary endpoint.

Several sensitivity analyses including comparison of unequivocal events of progression supported the 
reliability of the data obtained on PFS.  
Safety 
Due to the high unmet medical need in this indication, the toxicity associated with bevacizumab 
therapy does not raise major concerns. No detriments on OS were observed. 
Conclusion on the overall B/R 
There is high medical need for improved therapy of GBM. Temozolomide was the latest agent approved 
for the indication (EU MAA 26/01/1999). GBM is a brain tumor with significant differences from other 
solid tumors both in characteristics and in the presentation of the well being of patients. The applicant 
has provided data that shows a clinically meaningful gain in PFS when bevacizumab is added to 
standard radiotherapy/chemotherapy. The PFS gain is associated with a significantly prolonged 
functional status as measured by KPS and diminished steroid use. Thus, efficacy has been adequately 
demonstrated despite the lack of significantly superior OS results. The added toxicity associated with 
bevacizumab therapy does not raise major concerns.  
B/R balance is considered favourable.

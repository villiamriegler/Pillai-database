Uterine fibroids (uterine leiomyoma) are benign, monoclonal, hormone-sensitive, smooth muscle tumours of 
the uterus. They are the most common tumour of the female reproductive tract in pre-menopausal women 
and have been reported to affect 20-40% of women during their reproductive years. 
Uterine fibroids are often asymptomatic, but when symptomatic, the primary symptoms are heavy uterine 
bleeding,  anaemia,  abdominal  pressure,  abdominal  pain,  increased  urinary  frequency  and  infertility.  In 
particular, heavy menstrual blood loss is one of the most frequently disabling symptoms of uterine fibroids.  
Uterine fibroids are commonly treated surgically. Symptomatic uterine fibroids are the leading reason for 
hysterectomy. Other, less invasive treatment procedures include myomectomy (which may preserve 
fertility), uterine artery embolization and, if the dominant symptom is bleeding, endometrial ablation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/341144/2015 
Page 6/74 
 
  
  
 
 
Medical treatments of symptomatic fibroids are currently limited to short-term use prior to surgery and 
comprise either progesterone receptor modulators, i.e. ulipristal acetate (Esmya) or gonadotropin releasing 
hormone (GnRH) agonists.  
GnRH-agonists  are  effective  in  reducing  fibroid-related  bleeding,  correcting  anaemia  when  given 
concomitantly with iron therapy, reducing abdominal symptoms and reducing fibroid and uterine volume. 
Their  use  is  limited  to  3-6  months  duration  as  suppression  of  oestrogen  to  castration  levels  results  in 
menopausal symptoms including hot flushes, mood swings and loss of libido and can also lead to loss of bone 
mineral density. 
Ulipristal acetate 5 mg tablets (Esmya) is currently approved for pre-operative use with a posology restricted 
to two intermittent treatment courses of 3 months due to absence of long-term safety data. 
Surgery may not be a suitable option for all patients, e.g. for medical or personal reasons or if the woman is 
peri-menopausal and would rather wait that the symptoms of uterine fibroids decrease as result of 
menopause. Thus, a long-term medical treatment of fibroids would be valuable. 
About the product 
Esmya (ulipristal acetate) is an orally-active, synthetic selective progesterone receptor modulator 
characterised by a tissue-specific partial progesterone antagonist effect. Each tablet contains 5 mg of 
ulipristal acetate. 
Esmya was granted EU Marketing Authorisation on 23 February 2012 for the pre-operative treatment of 
moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids in adult women of reproductive age with a treatment 
duration limited to 3 months. The duration of treatment was limited to one course of 3 months which was 
due to the absence of long term safety data for a period longer than 3 months or on repeat courses of 
treatment.  
Subsequently the indication was extended to allow two 3-month treatment courses if deemed appropriate by 
the treating physician (variation EMEA/H/C/2041/II/19, EC Decision on 18 December 2013). This was based 
on the results of PGL09-027 and PGL09-026 studies (respectively PEARL III extension and PEARL III) which 
investigated the safety and efficacy of up to four 3-month treatment courses of ulipristal acetate 10 mg.  
The present variation application is to extend the indication to allow repeated intermittent treatment courses 
in women who are not planned to undergo surgery. 
The indication applied for was: “Ulipristal acetate is indicated for long term (repeated intermittent) 
treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids in adult women of reproductive age.” 
The indication recommended is: “Ulipristal acetate is indicated for intermittent treatment of moderate to 
severe symptoms of uterine fibroids in adult women of reproductive age” (see SmPC section 4.1) 
The treatment consists of one tablet of 5 mg to be taken orally once daily for treatment courses of up to 3 
months each. 
Treatments should only be initiated when menstruation has occurred:  
- The first treatment course should start during the first week of menstruation. 
- Re-treatment courses should start at the earliest during the first week of the second menstruation following 
the previous treatment course completion. 
The treating physician should explain to the patient the requirement for treatment free intervals.  
Repeated intermittent treatment has been studied up to 4 intermittent courses (see SmPC section 4.2).

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Based on the CHMP Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00, 1 June 2006), an action limit is in principle not applicable for ulipristal acetate, 
as it is a selective progesterone receptor modulator and a potential endocrine disruptor. 
At the time of marketing authorisation, the calculated concentration for PECsurface water was estimated to 
be less than the 0.01 μg/L threshold value. Based on the extensive metabolism and very limited excretion of 
unchanged ulipristal, its therapeutic use is unlikely to represent a risk to the environment. However, a Phase 
II environmental risk assessment was recommended, and underway, to further characterise the potential 
endocrine modulating properties of ulipristal acetate in the environment. 
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP 
has recommended the following points to be addressed: 
- a phase II ERA for ulipristal acetate. 
Results of the ongoing fish-full life-cycle (FFLC) study which is part of the Environmental Risk Assessment 
(ERA) phase II program are expected early Q2 2015. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP 
recommends the following points for further investigation: 
- a phase II ERA for ulipristal acetate including a fish-full life-cycle (FFLC) study 
2.3.  Clinical aspects

a  with a 6 months safety follow-up. 
b  80 mg Fe2+ (Tardyferon, containing 256.3mg of ferrous sulfate, equivalent to 80mg of Fe2+) was administered daily, 
concomitantly in all treatment groups 
c  Administered as an intramuscular injection 
d  after 90 days of ulipristal acetate treatment, all subjects were randomized to receive a treatment of 10 days of 10 mg 
of NETA or placebo.  
e 
treatment courses were separated by a drug free interval of approximately 6 weeks. 
f  Week 12 to Week 24 was an optional, unblinded extension period of ulipristal acetate treatment, which was 
PEARL III 
undertaken by 4 subjects from the placebo group (2 each received ulipristal acetate 10 and 20 mg/day), 3 subjects in 
the ulipristal acetate 10 mg/day group and 6 subjects in the ulipristal acetate 20 mg/day group 
Short-term efficacy of ulipristal acetate was investigated in previously submitted studies, evaluating 
pre-operative treatment of uterine fibroids: 
–  Two short-term Phase III studies (Study PGL07-021 and Study PGL07-022), 
–  Two smaller Phase II studies (Study PGL-N-0287 and Study PGL-N-0090) 
A further Phase III study, PGL09-026, evaluated the efficacy of a 3-month course of ulipristal acetate 10 mg 
once daily. 
The efficacy of ulipristal acetate as a long-term treatment of uterine fibroids has been assessed in two 
long-term Phase III studies which are submitted in support of this extension of indication: 
–  The above mentioned Study PGL09-026 and its extension PGL09-027 assessed the efficacy and 
safety of ulipristal acetate 10 mg over a total of 4 intermittent 3-month treatment courses 
–  Study PGL11-006 assessed the efficacy and safety of ulipristal acetate 5 and 10 mg over a total of 
4 intermittent 3-month treatment courses.

2.4.  Clinical pharmacology 
No additional clinical pharmacology data have been submitted within this variation which was considered 
acceptable by CHMP considering the applied extension of indication. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The present application is based on the results from study PGL11-006 (Clinical study report covering Part I 
of this study dated 28 May 2014, with the results of the first 2 treatment courses; Clinical study report 
covering Part II dated 12 March 2015 including results of courses 3 and 4).  
In addition, some results from the previously assessed study PGL09-027 (see variation application 
EMEA/H/C/2041/II/19) have also been presented. Study PGL09-027 was a Phase III, multicentre, clinical 
study investigating the efficacy and safety of three successive courses of 3-month open-label ulipristal 
acetate treatment, each followed by ten days of double-blind treatment with progestin or placebo and a 
drug-free period until return of menses, in subjects with myomas and heavy uterine bleeding. Study 
PGL09-027 was the optional extension to study PGL09-026. The main objective of this extension study was 
to assess the sustained efficacy and safety of long term on-off treatment with Esmya on uterine bleeding, 
myoma size, pain and quality of life. The study consisted of 3 further courses of 3 months open-label Esmya 
treatment, each followed by 10 days of double-blind treatment with Norethisterone acetate (NETA) or 
placebo, and then a drug-free period. 
2.5.1.  Main study 
Study PGL11-006 
This was a Phase III, multicentre, randomised, double-blind clinical study, investigating the efficacy and 
safety of repeated 12-week courses of daily 5 mg or 10 mg doses of ulipristal acetate for the long-term 
management of symptomatic uterine fibroids. 
Methods 
Study participants 
The study population consisted of pre-menopausal women with symptomatic uterus myoma(s) 
characterised by heavy bleeding. Patients had to have the required severity of symptoms, i.e. Pictorial 
Bleeding Assessment Chart (PBAC) score >100, but with no condition that was so severe that emergency 
surgery would have been required within 3 months regardless of any treatment impact. 
Key inclusion criteria are outlined below: 
–  Pre-menopausal women between 18 and 50 years inclusive. 
–  Patient with a Body Mass Index ≥18 and ≤40. 
–  Patient with hormonal levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) ≤20 mIU/mL (measured at the 
screening 2). 
–  Patient with myomatous uterus <16 weeks (compared to a uterus of 16 weeks of pregnancy). 
–  Patient with a largest uterine myoma between 3 cm and 12 cm diameter inclusive. 
–  Patient with menstrual cycle ≥22 and ≤35 days. The menstrual cycle between screening 1 and visit 
2 was the one considered for assessing eligibility.

–  The patient had had a significant and persisting finding on Papanikolaou test (PAP) smear within the 
past 12 months. 
–  The patient had a history of endometrium hyperplasia or adenocarcinoma or similar lesions in the 
screening biopsy. If by exception the endometrium biopsy results were only made available after the 
subject’s visit 2, the Investigator followed certain instructions listed in the protocol. 
–  Patient had a large uterine polyp (>2 cm). 
–  Patient had extensively calcified myomas and/or uterus. 
–  Patient had a known severe coagulation disorder. 
–  Patient had one or more ovarian cysts ≥4 cm diagnosed by ultrasound (US).

contraceptive within the month before the screening visit 
o  Acetylsalicylic acid, mefenamic acid, anticoagulants such as coumarins and/or antifibrinolytic 
drugs such as tranexamic acid within 1 week before the screening visit 
o  Systemic glucocorticoid treatments and/or systemic depot glucocorticoid treatments within 1 
week or 2 months before the screening visit, respectively. 
o  Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) agonist and antagonist: 
• 
immediate or monthly sustained release depot preparation or immediate release form within 
6 months of screening visit 
•  3 or 6 months sustained release depot preparation within 12 months before the screening 
visit. 
–  The patient was likely to require treatment during the study with drugs that were not permitted by 
the study protocol: progestins (systemic or progestin releasing intra-uterine system), hormonal 
contraceptives, systemic glucocorticoids (oral and injectable), GnRH agonist and GnRH antagonists. 
Assessment report  
EMA/341144/2015 
Page 11/74 
 
  
  
–  The patient required treatment with a medication which included potent inhibitors of cytochrome 
P450 (CYP)3A4 (such as ketoconazole) or potent inducers of CYP3A4 (such as rifampicin). 
–  The patient had abnormal hepatic function at study entry (defined as aspartate transaminase [AST], 
alanine transaminase [ALT], gamma-glutamyl transferase [GGT], hepatic alkaline phosphatase, or 
total bilirubin above twice the upper limit of normal). In case of isolated elevated GGT, the subject 
could be enrolled if the re-test was within the allowed limits. 
–  The patient had a positive pregnancy test at baseline, was nursing or planning a pregnancy during 
the course of the study. 
Treatments 
There were two parallel arms in the study: 
• 
• 
PGL4001 (ulipristal acetate) 5 mg daily administration (PGL4001 5 mg + placebo of the PGL4001 
10 mg tablet) 
PGL4001 (ulipristal acetate) 10 mg daily administration (PGL4001 10 mg + placebo of the PGL4001 
5 mg tablet) 
Each treatment course lasted 12 weeks (84 days). Treatment courses were separated by a drug-free period 
until the start of the second menstruation following the end of the previous treatment course. There were 4 
treatment courses in total.   
The clinical study report for Part I presented data after completion of treatment courses 1 and 2, up to visit 
8. 
The final clinical study report (Part II) presented data after completion of all four treatment courses, up to 
visit 12. 
The study design is outlined below (Figure 1).

Figure 1: PEARL IV (PGL11-006) Study Design 
Patients started the 12 week PGL4001 treatment (treatment course 1) at visit 2, which took place within the 
first 4 days of the start of menstruation following completion of screening assessments. At visit 6 (between 
10 and 18 days after the first day of the first menstruation following the end of treatment course 1), 
PGL4001 treatment course 2 was dispensed and patients were instructed to start taking the medication on 
the first or second day of their next menstruation. At visits 8 and 9 (between 10 and 18 days after the first 
day of the first menstruation following the end of treatment courses 2 and 3 respectively), PGL4001 
treatment courses 3 and 4, respectively, were dispensed and patients were instructed to start taking the 
medication on the first or second day of their next menstruation. 
Objectives 
Part I: 
The primary objective was to compare and assess the sustained efficacy of two repeated 12-week treatment

12-week treatment courses of daily administration of 5 mg or 10 mg doses of PGL4001 respectively. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy Measurements 
•  Uterine bleeding pattern 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of patients who are in amenorrhoea at the end of both 
treatment courses 1 and 2 (Part I) and at the end of all treatment courses (Part II). Amenorrhoea was 
defined as no more than 1 day of spotting within a 35-day interval. 
Patients recorded their bleeding pattern in their diary using an 8-day PBAC at screening, when a score of 
>100 was required for inclusion, and after the first, second and fourth treatment courses. In total, patients 
were expected to complete the PBAC for 32 days (4 x 8 days). Bleeding occurring outside of the timeframe 
described above was recorded in the subject diary in a simplified semi-quantitative bleeding pattern 
containing 4 categories defined as “no bleeding”, “spotting”, “bleeding” or “heavy bleeding”. 
A large number of secondary end-points (Part I and Part II) were also related to the bleeding pattern, e.g.: 
Assessment report  
EMA/341144/2015 
Page 14/74 
 
  
  
–  Percentage of subjects in amenorrhoea at the end of treatment course 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively 
–  Percentage of subjects in amenorrhoea in the last 56 days of treatment course 1, 2, 3 and 4, 
respectively 
–  Proportion of days with uterine bleeding between visit 2 and visit 8 (Part I), between visit 2 and visit 
11 (Part II) 
–  Proportion of days with heavy uterine bleeding between visit 2 and visit 8 (Part I), between visit 2 
and visit 11 (Part II) 
–  Median time to amenorrhoea during treatment course 1,  course 2, course 3 and course 4 
respectively 
•  Myoma volume 
Change from baseline to visits 6, 7 and 8 (Part I) or to visits 9, 10, 11 and 12 (Part II) in the volume of the 
three largest myomas and in uterus volume, measured by transvaginal US were secondary efficacy 
end-points in Part I. 
Total volume of the 3 largest myomas and uterine volume were measured at screening 3 and visits 6, 7, 8, 
9, 10, 11 and 12. If possible, the US was performed by the same assessor at each visit. 
• 
Pain 
Change from baseline to end of treatment course 1 and course 2 (Part I) and to treatment course 3 and 
course 4 (Part II), respectively, in pain measured by VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) were secondary 
end-points. VAS was recorded in diaries at the start and end of each treatment course, at the start of the 
second menses after treatment course 4 and at visit 12. A Pain VAS score of 0 represented no pain and a 
score of 100 represented worst possible pain. 
•  Quality of life 
Other secondary endpoints were change from baseline to end of treatment course 1 and course 2 (Part I) 
and course 3 and course 4 (Part II), respectively in QoL. QoL was measured using the specific UFS-QoL 
symptom severity score (Measurement of Discomfort due to Uterine Fibroids) and HRQL scales, and also by 
the general EQ-5D questionnaire (a general QoL scale used in several conditions). 
Safety Measurements 
• 
Endometrial thickness  
A transvaginal ultrasound, during which the endometrial thickness was measured (mm), was performed at 
screening 3 and visits 6 to 12. If possible, the transvaginal US was performed by the same operator at the 
appropriate visits. 
• 
Endometrium biopsy 
The sample collection of endometrial tissue was performed by a gynaecologist at screening (screening 3), at 
visit 3 (only if screening biopsy was “not adequate”), after 2 treatment courses (at visit 8), at visit 9 (only if 
biopsy was “not adequate” at visit 8), after 4 treatment courses (visit 11) and 3 months after last dose (visit 
12).  
•  Other safety assessments 
Apart from the endometrial assessments by ultrasound and biopsies, conventional safety assessments were 
made, e.g. vital sign measurements and electrocardiogram, laboratory safety examinations (including 
serum levels of estradiol, thyroid stimulating hormone, follicle stimulating hormone and haematology, 
coagulation, biochemistry and lipid parameters) as well as adverse event reporting and collection (including 
Assessment report  
EMA/341144/2015 
Page 15/74 
 
  
  
the above mentioned assessments, gynaecological and breast examination, any other specific assessments 
and subjects reporting of AEs). 
Sample size 
The sample size of this study was based on assessing both the efficacy and safety of long-term treatment of 
PGL4001. A sample size of 200 subjects per treatment arm results in the study having a power greater than 
85% to detect an absolute difference in the primary endpoint between 2 treatment groups of 14% (that is, 
68% versus 82%) or greater, using a 2-sided test conducted at a type I error rate of 5%. This was deemed 
sensitive enough, as in the absence of treatment the expected occurrence of the primary endpoint would be 
close to zero. In addition, the sample size calculated for the efficacy endpoint was deemed adequate in order 
to assess the safety of long-term treatment. 
Myoma volume was also taken into consideration and the analysis was conducted after log transformation of 
the data, with the corresponding results back-transformed. Assuming a between-subject standard deviation 
of 0.6 on the log scale, a sample size of 200 subjects per treatment arm results in the study having a power 
of 85% to detect a ratio of average myoma volume for PGL4001 10 mg compared to PGL4001 5 mg of 0.66 
or less. 
Assuming a drop-out rate of approximately 10% based on previous studies, the objective was to randomise 
444 subjects in order to have 400 subjects who complete 2 treatment courses. 
Randomisation 
At visit 2, eligible subjects were randomised to either PGL4001 5 mg or PGL4001 10 mg in a 1:1 ratio via 
centralized Interactive Voice/Web Response System (IVRS/IWRS). The randomisation scheme is stratified 
by site. Subjects were randomised into blocks of a predetermined length. 
Blinding (masking) 
The PGL4001 5 mg or 10 mg treatment was allocated randomly in a double-blind design. The 5 mg tablets 
had a 150 mg fill weight while the 10 mg tablets had a 300 mg fill weight. The blind was maintained by 
administering daily to each subject a tablet of 150 mg together with a tablet of 300 mg, by using matching 
placebo of 150 mg and 300 mg fill weight.  
The study blind was maintained until the lock of the Part I database (up to and including visit 8 for all 
subjects). Once the Part I database was locked, the randomisation code was broken in order for the Part I 
analyses to be performed. Only the Sponsor and MDSL International statistics and data management 
personnel were therefore unblinded at this point. 
Investigators, monitors, pathologists and subjects remain blinded until the Part II database has been 
cleaned and locked. 
Statistical methods 
Population for main analyses 
Efficacy analyses were conducted on the Full Analysis Set 1 (FAS 1) and the PP population sets. FAS 1 
population was defined as all randomised subjects who received study medication at least once during 
treatment course 1. Analysis of primary efficacy endpoints and myoma volume was also conducted on FAS 
2, 3 and 4 (i.e. randomised subjects who received study medication at least once during treatment course 2, 
3 and 4 respectively). Subjects in the FAS 1 population were analysed according to the treatment group to 
which they were randomised, rather than by the actual treatment they received. PP population sets were 
defined for each treatment course as all subjects who had not withdrawn prior to receiving at least 56 days 
(i.e. 2 months or 2x28 days) of ulipristal acetate treatment during the specific treatment course and had not 
Assessment report  
EMA/341144/2015 
Page 16/74 
 
  
  
reported any major protocol deviations up to the start of the next treatment course or prior to study 
withdrawal. 
Imputation rules for uterine bleeding endpoints 
As bleeding monitoring by either a PBAC score or daily diary card was conducted for an extensive period of 
time (up to approximately 21 months), rules were defined to deal with occasional missing information. 
Despite the long duration of the study, for the FAS 1, 63.0% subjects had sufficient uterine bleeding data to 
allow assessment of the primary endpoint using observed data only. Imputation rules applied to the daily 
uterine bleeding pattern, amenorrhoea and controlled bleeding assessments are; if three consecutive days 
or less of the daily uterine bleeding pattern are missing, the values for the missing days will be imputed with 
the greatest strength of bleeding immediately before or after the period of missing days. For example, if a 
subject records ‘Heavy Bleeding’ then has two missing days followed by ‘Spotting’, the missing days will be 
imputed as ‘Heavy Bleeding’. If more than three consecutive days of the daily uterine bleeding pattern are 
missing, the values for the missing days will not be imputed. If a subject has more than three consecutive 
missing days in the last 35 days of a treatment course the amenorrhoea assessment will therefore be 
missing, unless the subject has reported at least two days of spotting or at least one day of bleeding/heavy 
bleeding in the last 35 days of the treatment course in question (subject is not in amenorrhoea).  
Imputation due to early discontinuation 
If a subject withdrew prior to completing a treatment course then: 
• the amenorrhoea assessment was imputed as a failure (subject was not in amenorrhoea) for the treatment 
course in question (if the amenorrhoea assessment was missing for that course), and for any subsequent 
course that had not been started for subjects where the primary reason for withdrawal was deemed 
negative, i.e. a treatment failure. Negative reasons for withdrawal included, but were not limited to, AE, 
protocol deviation and lack of efficacy. 
• the amenorrhoea assessment was imputed as a success (subject was in amenorrhoea) for the treatment 
course in question (if the amenorrhoea assessment was missing for that course), and for any subsequent 
course that had not been started if the primary reason for withdrawal was deemed positive. Positive reasons 
for withdrawal included, but were not limited to, subject request: wished pregnancy and subject request: 
symptoms so much better that no longer continued on treatment. 
Primary Efficacy Analyses 
All statistical hypothesis tests and CIs were two sided, using a 5% level of statistical significance.  
The results obtained with the two doses of ulipristal acetate (5 mg and 10 mg) were compared using a 
continuity-adjusted chi-squared test. The confidence interval for the difference between PGL4001 5mg and 
PGL4001 10mg are presented using the Newcombe-Wilson score method. 
Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
The secondary endpoints of percentage or proportions were analysed using the same method employed for 
the primary analysis. 
The median time to amenorrhoea during each treatment course was analysed using Kaplan-Meier methods.  
Changes from baseline to each treatment course in quality of life measured with the UFS-QoL questionnaire, 
EQ-5D VAS scores and pain measured by VAS were analysed using an ANCOVA model with terms for 
treatment, treatment course, baseline value and the following interactions: treatment course x treatment, 
treatment course x baseline. The covariance among the repeated measures was modelled separately as 
unstructured. From the resulting model, estimates of the mean change with the two doses of ulipristal 
acetate were compared, and CIs and p-values were presented for the end of each treatment course. Shift

tables showing changes from baseline were presented for each of the 5 dimensions of the EQ-5D 
questionnaire. The number and percentage of subjects whose pain improved by at least 30% and 50% were 
summarised by time point, and a subgroup analysis of the most severe subjects at baseline (VAS >40) was 
performed.  
Changes in fibroid volume and in uterine volume were analysed with a repeated measures ANCOVA model. 
Data were log-transformed before analysis and subsequently back-transformed prior to presentation. The 
ANCOVA model included the log total fibroid/uterine volume as the dependent variable and terms for 
treatment, visit, log total fibroid/uterine volume at screening and the following interactions: visit x 
treatment, visit x log total fibroid/uterine volume at screening. The covariance among the repeated 
measures was modelled separately as unstructured.

Recruitment 
The study was initiated the 26 June 2012 and completed the 19 December 2014.  
Conduct of the study 
Five major protocol deviations were reported. Two patients, both from the PGL4001 5 mg group, had major 
protocol deviations associated with compliance (one subject had 76.4% compliance during treatment course 
1 and the other subject had 63.6% compliance during course 2). Three additional major protocol deviations 
occurred in the PGL4001 10 mg group, 2 at randomisation and 1 incorrect treatment allocation. 
Compliance data were available for 224 of the 230 subjects in the 5 mg group and for 218 of the 221 subjects 
in the 10 mg group. The mean regimen compliance for subjects from the PGL4001 5 mg group was 99.3%, 
and the mean protocol compliance was 94.9%, reflecting the early termination of some subjects. For the 
10 mg group, the mean regimen compliance was 99.4%, and the mean protocol compliance was 94.5%.

Baseline data 
Table 3: Demographic Data 
All treated patients (451) had a diagnosis of uterine leiomyoma. Subjects from the PGL4001 5 mg and 10 mg 
groups had a similar medical and surgical history. 
All subjects had very severe uterine bleeding with a mean (median) PBAC at screening of 302 (220) (range 
33 to 2370). Overall, mean total fibroid volume was 84.6 cm3 (ranging from 3.0 to 826 cm3) and mean 
uterine volume was 227.3 cm3 (ranging from 31.6 to 1286.0 cm3). The uterine volume was comparable in 
the two treatment groups with an overall mean (median) of 227.3 (175.7) cm3.

At screening, mean Hb was 12.27 g/dL and mean Hct was 39.8%. At baseline, 37.4% of the subjects were 
anaemic (Hb≤12 g/dL), and 10.6% of subjects had moderate to severe anaemia (Hb ≤ 10.2 g/dL). 
Subjects in the PGL4001 5 mg and 10 mg groups had similar baseline conditions. 
Concomitant medications were taken by a total of 245 (54.3%) of all subjects from the start of treatment 
course 1 until visit 12 of the study (Safety Set); 131 (57.0%) subjects from the PGL4001 5 mg group and 
114 (51.6%) subjects from the PGL4001 10 mg group. 
The most frequently taken medications were anti-inflammatory/anti-rheumatic products, taken by 19.7% of 
subjects (most commonly ibuprofen taken by 15.1% of subjects), analgesics and antipyretics, taken by 
19.5% of subjects (most commonly paracetamol taken by 15.7% subjects), and iron products taken by 
8.4% of all subjects.  
At the start of this study, surgery was not planned for the majority of subjects (410 subjects, 90.9%), 
whereas in Studies PGL07-021 and PGL07-022 surgery was planned for all subjects enrolled, and in Study 
PGL09-026 it was planned for 44.3% of subjects. During the study, 435 (96.5%) subjects in the FAS 1 did 
not have surgery performed; surgery was performed on 16 (3.5%) subjects (7 [3.1%] and 9 [4.0%] in the 
PGL4001 5 mg and PGL4001 10 mg groups, respectively); for 13 of these surgery was not planned at the 
start of the study.  The decision drivers for the 16 subjects that had surgery performed were reported as 
‘mainly Investigator recommendation’ for 7 subjects, ‘mainly driven by subject request’ for 6 subjects (FAS 
1), and ‘equal influence’ for 3 subjects. The main reason for surgery was reported as ‘insufficient efficacy of 
treatment’ for 6 subjects, ‘poor tolerability to the treatment’ for 1 subject and ‘other’ for 9 subjects. The 
‘other’ main reasons for surgery were ‘not compliant and frequent spotting’, ‘progression of strong pelvic 
pain – pelvic and ovarian endometriosis’, ‘patient wanted surgery’, ‘a myoma in status nascendi’, ‘ovarian 
cyst’, ‘the treatment made the myoma nodule smaller and it was a partial myoma in status nascendi with 
signs of infection’, ‘emergency partial expulsion of myoma’, ‘endometrial adenocarcinoma’ and ‘severe 
pelvic pain, necrosis of myoma node’.

Percentage of subjects in amenorrhoea at the end of both treatment courses 1 and 2 (Part I) 
A total of 384 subjects in the FAS 1 had an amenorrhoea assessment at the end of both treatment courses 
1 and 2. 
Table 5: Analysis of patients in amenorrhoea at the end of both treatment courses 1 and 2 (Full Analysis Set 
1) 
Different sensitivity analyses were performed, for instance by imputing missing amenorrhoea assessments 
at the end of treatment courses 1 and/or 2 as a failure (not in amenorrhoea) or as a success (in 
amenorrhoea).  
For sensitivity analysis 1, the number (percentage) of subjects in amenorrhoea at the end of both treatment 
courses 1 and 2 was 122 (53.5%) of 228 subjects and 136 (61.0%) of 223 subjects for the PGL4001 5 mg 
and PGL4001 10 mg groups, respectively. The difference was 7.5% (95% CI: -1.6% to 16.6%, p-value: 
0.131). 
For sensitivity analysis 2, missing amenorrhoea assessments at the end of treatment courses 1 and/or 2 
were imputed as a success (in amenorrhoea). The corresponding number (percentage) of subjects in 
amenorrhoea for this sensitivity analysis was 145 (63.6%) and 168 (75.3%) for the 5 mg and 10 mg groups, 
respectively. The difference was 11.7% (95% CI: 3.3% to 20.2%, p-value: 0.009). 
Analyses were also performed on the FAS 2 and PP Set 2, yielding fairly similar results as above.  
Percentage of subjects in amenorrhoea at the end of all four treatment courses (Part II) 
A total of 207 subjects in the FAS 1 had an amenorrhoea assessment at the end of all four treatment courses.

Table 6: Analysis of patients in amenorrhoea at the end of all four treatment courses (Full Analysis Set 1) 
A number of sensitivity analyses were conducted using the FAS 1 to investigate the effect of different 
assumptions when handling missing amenorrhoea information, with the corresponding results as follows: 
For sensitivity analysis 1, missing amenorrhoea assessments at the end of treatment courses 1, 2, 3 and/or 
4 were imputed as a failure (not in amenorrhoea). The number (percentage) of subjects in amenorrhoea at 
the end of all four treatment courses was 95 (41.7%) and 112 (50.2%) for the PGL4001 5 mg and PGL4001 
10 mg groups, respectively. The difference was 8.6% (95% CI: -0.6% to 17.7%, p-value: 0.084). 
For sensitivity analysis 2, missing amenorrhoea assessments at the end of treatment courses 1, 2, 3 and/or 
4 were imputed as a success (in amenorrhoea). The number (percentage) of subjects in amenorrhoea at the 
end of all four treatment courses for this sensitivity analysis was 112 (49.1%) and 136 (61.0%) for the 
PGL4001 5 mg and PGL4001 10 mg groups, respectively. The difference was 11.9% (95% CI: of 2.7% to 
21.0%, p-value: 0.015). 
Sensitivity analysis 3 (up to 5 consecutive missing days were imputed prior to assessing amenorrhoea at the 
end of each treatment course) and sensitivity analysis 4 (only observed uterine bleeding data used in the 
assessment of amenorrhoea) provided similar differences between the 2 treatment groups compared to 
those of the primary analysis (differences: 11.7% and 10.4%, p-values: 0.024 and 0.208, respectively).

PBAC during the off-treatment periods 
The mean (median) PBAC scores associated with return of menstruation decreased after each subsequent 
treatment course. The extent of reduction in the ulipristal acetate + Placebo group in Study PGL09-027 was 
similar to that observed in the two treatment groups in Study PGL11-006. In Study PGL09-027, NETA had an 
additional positive impact on the reduction of menstrual bleeding.

Fibroid size 
In the FAS 1 population, the mean (median) total volume at screening 3 was 76.87 cm3 (42.61 cm3) and 
92.32 cm3 (43.57 cm3) in the 5 mg/day group and 10 mg/day group, respectively.  
In terms of fibroid volume reduction, the total volume of the 3 largest fibroids identified at screening was 
shown  to  decrease  following  the  first  treatment  course,  and  to  further  decrease  after  each  treatment 
course, with no statistically significant differences identified between the two treatment groups. The mean 
(19.23  cm3)  and  57.10  cm3 
(median) total volume of the 3  largest  myomas at end of treatment course 2 (Visit 7) had been 44.59 
cm3 
(19.83  cm3)  for  the  PGL4001  5  mg  and  PGL4001  10  mg  groups, 
respectively.  By  the  end  of  treatment  course  4  (Visit  10)  the  mean  (median)  volume  of  the  3  largest 
(13.27 cm3) and 39.02 cm3 
myomas was decreased to 41.23 cm3 
(13.68 cm3) for the PGL4001 5 mg and 
PGL4001 10 mg groups, respectively. The mean (median) percent change from baseline (screening 3) to 
visit 10 was -37.09%  (-71.83%)  and  -57.80%  (-72.73%)  in  the  PGL4001  5 mg  and  PGL4001  10 mg 
groups, respectively.

Uterine volume reduction 
Similar to the fibroid size, the volume of the uterus as measured by ultrasound decreased upon treatment 
with ulipristal acetate. The uterine volume decreased following each treatment course with no statistically 
significant differences between the two treatment groups at any visit.  
The percentage of subjects with a reduction in uterine volume of ≥25% and ≥50% at different time points

Effect on Haemoglobin 
In Study PGL11-006, 40% of subjects had Hb ≤12 g/dL at baseline, including 12% with more severe 
anaemia with equal distribution between the two treatment arms. After one treatment course, the 
percentage of subjects being anaemic decreased to 21% and 17% for subjects in the 5 mg and 10 mg group, 
respectively. The percentage of subjects with more severe anaemia was decreased to 3% and 4% for the 5 
mg and 10 mg group respectively, with no difference between treatment groups. 
Quality of Life assessments 
The improvements in symptom severity and HRQoL total scores were similar in the two treatment groups 
and were partially maintained during the off-treatment interval between treatment course 1 and treatment 
course 2. During treatment, both treatment groups reached symptom severity and total HRQoL scores 
similar to those observed in healthy women.  
In the total treatment group, the mean symptom severity score (UFS-QoL) at baseline was 48.73, with 
baseline scores being very similar in the two treatment groups. 
Regarding the UFS-QoL, at the end of treatment course 1 compared to baseline, the mean (median) change 
from baseline was of -32.30 (-34.38) and -31.19 (-31.25) in the PGL4001 5 mg and PGL4001 10 mg 
treatment groups, respectively. At the end of treatment course 2 compared to baseline, the mean (median) 
change was of -27.89 (-28.13) and -27.28 (-28.13) in the PGL4001 5 mg and PGL4001 10 mg groups, 
respectively. At the end of treatment course 3, the mean (median) change from baseline was -29.48 
(-28.13) and -29.40 (-31.25) in the PGL4001 5 mg and 10 mg groups, respectively. At the end of treatment 
course 4, the mean (median) change from baseline was -29.81 (-31.25) and -29.81 (-28.13) in the PGL4001 
5 mg and 10 mg groups, respectively. 
The pattern of improvement was similar for the HRQoL.

In the EQ-5D questionnaire, the most complaints at baseline and throughout the study were in the 
pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression dimensions.  
Compared to baseline, at Visit 5, the percentage of subjects exhibiting moderate pain/discomfort was 
reduced in both treatment groups, from 44.4% to 22.3% in the 5 mg/day group and from 45.0% to 23.5% 
subjects in the 10 mg/day group. The percentage of subjects exhibiting extreme pain/discomfort decreased 
from 4.5% to none in the 5 mg/day group and from 6.8% to 0.9% in the 10 mg/day group. At Visit 7, the 
numbers (percentages) of subjects with moderate and extreme pain/discomfort in the two treatment groups 
were similar to those observed at Visit 5 (end of treatment).  
Compared to baseline, at Visit 5 the percentage of subjects exhibiting moderate anxiety/depression was 
reduced in both treatment groups, from 29.9% to 16.7% in the 5 mg/day group and from 28.6% to 0.9% in 
the 10 mg/day group. Similarly, the percentage of subjects exhibiting extreme anxiety/depression 
decreased from 3.2% to 0.9% in the 5 mg/day group and from 3.6% to 0.9% in the 10 mg/day group. At 
Visit 7, the numbers (percentages) of subjects exhibiting moderate and extreme anxiety/depression in the 
two treatment groups were similar to those observed at Visit 5.  
This improvement was maintained at visits 7 and 10 (end of treatment courses 2 and 4) through to end of 
study follow-up at visit 12. 
Pain 
Pain was assessed by VAS (over a recall period of 1 month) for both the FAS 1 population and a subgroup of 
subjects with severe pain at baseline (VAS score >40). 
At the start of treatment course 1 (baseline) the mean pain VAS scores were 39.7 and 42.6 for the ulipristal 
acetate 5 mg/day and 10 mg/day groups, respectively. 
For the FAS 1, at the end of treatment course 1, both treatment groups showed a similar improvement 
(decrease) from baseline with a mean (median) change of -26.2 (-24.5) in the PGL4001 5 mg group and 
-28.3 (-25.0) in the PGL4001 10 mg group. After the off-treatment interval and return of menstruation at 
the start of treatment course 2 (start of the second menstruation following the end of treatment course 1), 
there was still an improvement from baseline on average but less than seen at the end of treatment course 
1, with mean (median) change from baseline of -7.3 (-3.0) and -14.7 (-8.0) in the PGL4001 5 mg and 
PGL4001 10 mg groups, respectively. At the end of treatment course 2, there was an average improvement 
compared to baseline with a mean (median) change from baseline of -22.3 (-23.0) and -25.6 (-24.0) in the 
PGL4001 5 mg and PGL4001 10 mg groups, respectively. The pattern of improvement from baseline 
continued over the next two treatment courses; at the end of treatment course 3, there was a mean 
(median) change from baseline of -26.1 (-20.5) and -28.2 (-24.5) in the PGL4001 5 mg and PGL4001 10 mg 
groups, respectively, and at the end of treatment course 4, there was a mean (median) change from 
baseline of -21.2 (-20.0) and -27.3 (-23.0) in the PGL4001 5 mg and PGL4001 10 mg groups, respectively. 
The decrease from baseline in pain VAS score at the start of each treatment course was slightly less than 
seen at the end of the treatment course. There was no evidence of a difference in the change from baseline 
in pain VAS between the two treatment groups. 
The average pain VAS score continued to show an improvement (decrease) post-treatment; at visit 12 (end 
of study follow-up visit) the mean (median) change from baseline was -14.9 (-16.0) and -18.2 (-19.0) in the 
PGL4001 5 mg and PGL4001 10 mg groups, respectively.

Analysis description 
All statistical hypothesis tests and CIs were two sided, using a 5% level of 
statistical significance.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of subjects in amenorrhoea 
at the end of both treatment courses 1 and 2 (Part I) or all four courses (Part 
II), which was summarised by descriptive statistics for each treatment group 
and overall. The results obtained with the two doses of ulipristal acetate (5 mg 
and 10 mg) were compared using a continuity-adjusted chi-squared test. The 
confidence interval for the difference between PGL4001 5mg and PGL4001 
10mg was also presented, using the Newcombe-Wilson score method. 
The secondary endpoints of percentage or proportions were analysed using 
the same method employed for the primary analysis. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
No pooled analysis or meta-analysis have been performed by the applicant. However, indirect comparisons 
have been made between studies PGL09-027 and PGL11-006, as shown above. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Results from study PGL11-006 providing data for up to 4 treatment courses with ulipristal acetate were 
submitted in support of this variation application along with data for repeated treatment courses from the 
previously submitted study PGL09-026 and its extension PGL09-027.  Study PGL11-006 was completed in 
two parts: Part I presented data after completion of treatment courses 1 and 2, up to visit 8 and Part II 
presented data after completion of all four treatment courses, up to visit 12. 
The dose proposed for the new indication for long-term, intermittent use is the same as the approved dose 
for preoperative treatment, i.e. 5 mg per day. It was hypothesised that the 10 mg dose may have some 
advantages in term of efficacy over the 5 mg dose regimen for repeated intermittent administration. Hence, 
study PGL11-006 evaluated the efficacy and safety of ulipristal acetate 5 mg and 10 mg whereas study 
PGL09-026/027 only included the 10 mg dose.  
Assessment report  
EMA/341144/2015 
Page 36/74 
 
  
  
 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria of study PGL11-006 were acceptable and largely in line with those used 
in previous studies with ulipristal acetate, except that the women included in this study were not required to 
be eligible for a surgical procedure for their myomas.  
The design with intermittent treatment courses was used to allow menstrual shedding of the endometrium 
and a complete menstrual cycle to take place between each treatment course, with physiological 
progesterone influence on the endometrium. 
No placebo or active control arms were included. A placebo arm was considered unethical in patients with 
heavy menstrual bleeding and an active comparator control was not available due to the long duration of the 
study. These arguments are endorsed.  
The efficacy parameters chosen for this study are considered relevant, e.g. assessment of bleeding by PBAC, 
myoma volume, pain and quality of life. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients who are in 
amenorrhoea at the end of both treatment courses 1 and 2 for Part I of the study and at the end of the 4 
treatment courses for Part II of the study. Amenorrhoea is a rather strict endpoint, since it was defined as 
having no more than 1 day of spotting within a 35-day interval. For comparison with the pivotal phase 3 
studies in the initial marketing authorisation for Esmya, the co-primary endpoints were percentage of 
patients with reduction in uterine bleeding defined as PBAC score <75 at end of treatment and change in 
total myoma volume assessed by MRI from screening to end of treatment in Study PGL07-21. In study 
PGL07-22, the primary endpoint was the percentage of subjects with reduction in uterine bleeding defined as 
PBAC score <75 at end of treatment. 
The sample size calculation methods and the statistical methods are considered adequate for the study. 
In studies with long period of diary data, the amount of missing data is always a concern. In the FAS 1 
population, 63.0% subjects had sufficient uterine bleeding data to allow assessment of the primary endpoint 
using observed data only. Analysis on observed data only was presented as well as other sensitivity analyses 
handling early discontinuations. The analyses were pre-planned and adequate to address possible missing 
data scenarios. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In total, 114 (25.3%) subjects, i.e. 61 (26.8%) subjects from the PGL4001 5 mg group and 53 (23.8%) 
subjects from the PGL4001 10 mg group, discontinued the study after the start of treatment course 1 up to 
the end of study follow-up visit (visit 12), equally distributed between the treatment groups. The most 
common reasons were subject’s request and adverse events. Reasons for discontinuation did not show any 
distinct pattern. Some women discontinued since they had no return to menses within 90 days of the last 
dose and some due to lack of improvement.  
All treated subjects had a diagnosis of uterine leiomyoma and all subjects had very severe uterine bleeding 
with a mean (median) PBAC at screening of 302 (220). The baseline demographic and disease 
characteristics were similar for the two treatment groups. The study population included was rather similar 
to that included in previous studies, i.e. predominantly white women, aged just above 40 years, with a BMI 
of approximately 25 and the majority were of child-bearing potential. The disease characteristics were also 
rather similar to previous phase 3 studies, although mean PBAC, fibroid volume and uterine volume were 
slightly lower in this study. Surgery was initially planned for less than 10% of the women and a small number 
of women (n=16, 3.5%) underwent surgery in the study. 
For the primary efficacy endpoint, 62% of subjects were in amenorrhoea at the end of both treatment 
courses 1 and 2 in the 5 mg group compared to 73% subjects in the 10 mg group. Thus, there was a 
difference between the doses of about 10%. For comparison, 76% of the women in study PGL09-027 were 
in amenorrhea at the end of both treatment courses 1 and 2 and 72% had amenorrhea at the end of 
treatment courses 1, 2, 3 and 4. 
Assessment report  
EMA/341144/2015 
Page 37/74 
 
  
  
The proportion of subjects in amenorrhoea at the end of treatment course 4 was somewhat lower compared 
to the end of course 2 for both doses. However, the proportions are still considered to be of clinical relevance 
and 73.3 % of the patients on the 5 mg dose had controlled bleeding (no episodes of heavy bleeding and a 
maximum of 8 days of bleeding over 56 days) after treatment course 4. At the end of all 4 treatment 
courses, in the  5 mg group, 49 % of the women were in amenorrhoea compared to 61 % subjects in the 
PGL4001 10 mg group (p= 0.027) for the FAS 1. This proportion may seem low. However, the proportions 
are considerably higher after each treatment course and of clear clinical relevance. 
The mean (median) PBAC scores associated with return of menstruation decreased after each subsequent 
treatment course. Both fibroid volume and uterine volume decreased during the study. The total volume of 
the 3 largest myomas was shown to decrease following the second treatment course (-54 and -58% 
respectively for 5 mg and 10 mg), and to further decrease after each treatment course (about-72%). The 
reduction in volume was maintained thereafter until the end of study follow-up with no statistically 
significant differences seen between the two treatment groups at any visit in any of the analysis sets. 
The uterine volume as measured by US was shown to decrease following the first treatment course, and to 
further decrease following each treatment course, with a maintained reduction in volume thereafter which 
was slightly reduced at the end of study follow-up. A similar response was seen for subjects from both the 
PGL4001 5 mg and 10 mg groups, with no statistically significant differences between the treatment groups.  
The total volume of the 3 largest fibroids identified at screening was shown to decrease following the first 
treatment course, and to further decrease after each treatment course, with no statistically significant 
differences identified between the two treatment groups. The mean (median) percent change from baseline 
(screening 3) to visit 10 was -38% (-72%) and -58% (-73%) in the PGL4001 5 mg and PGL4001 10 mg 
groups, respectively. 
By the end of treatment course 4, 81% and 88% had a ≥25% myoma volume reduction in the PGL4001 5 
mg and PGL4001 10 mg treatment groups, respectively.  
Both doses of UPA showed improvement in quality of life measurements evaluated using the specific 
UFS-QoL symptom severity and HRQoL scales. 
During the off-treatment interval, with resumption of menstruation the quality of life was slightly reduced 
compared to the end of each treatment course, but was still improved in comparison to baseline. No 
difference between the two treatment groups could be observed. 
Overall, the efficacy results of Study PGL11-006 were in line with previously performed short-term and 
long-term Phase III studies. In this study, the 5 mg dose was included, whereas the previous long-term 
study PGL09-026 and its extension PGL09-027 only included data for the 10 mg dose. For several endpoints, 
the 10 mg dose was somewhat better than the 5 mg dose, however, for other endpoints (controlled 
bleeding, uterine and fibroid volume) there were no or only small differences. Due to the overall small 
differences, the choice of the 5 mg dose is deemed adequate. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Final results of study PGL11-006 showed that 73.3 % of the patients on the 5 mg dose had controlled 
bleeding (no episodes of heavy bleeding and a maximum of 8 days of bleeding over 56 days) after treatment 
course 4 which is considered to be of clinical relevance. In addition, the proportions of patients in 
amenorrhoea after each treatment course are of clear clinical relevance supporting repeated intermittent 
treatment with ulipristal acetate.

Long term treatment has been studied up to 4 intermittent treatment courses. Additional data will be 
available from two studies (study PGL11-024 and study PGL14-001). The currently ongoing study 
PGL11-024 (the second extension of PGL09-026, i.e. following PGL09-027) will provide safety and efficacy 
data of up to 8 treatment courses, i.e. data on 4 additional treatment courses further to the data submitted 
in this variation (see RMP). 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Clinical safety data for ulipristal acetate are available from 5 short-term completed Phase II and III studies 
(4 randomised, double-blind studies, 1 open-label study) and two long-term Phase III studies (1 completed 
open-label study PGL09-027, and 1 ongoing, randomised, double-blind study PGL11-006 for which Part I is 
completed). All studies were carried out in the target population. Additional safety data are available from 
24 studies in emergency contraception (3 repeated-dose and 21 single-dose studies). 
Patient exposure 
Over 6,200 subjects have been exposed to ulipristal acetate during its clinical development (completed 
studies, including PGL11-006 Part I) as an emergency contraceptive and as a treatment for uterine fibroids, 
including: 
•  6,168 subjects for 5 mg and above for any duration, 
•  4,999 subjects who have received a single dose, 
•  1,238 subjects who have received repeated doses, 
–  of whom 1,053 were exposed for ≥3 months to the target dose of 5 mg/day or higher, 
–  of whom 541 subjects were exposed for ≥ two 3-month treatment courses to the target does of 
5 mg/day or higher (which, when taking account of off-treatment intervals in studies PGL09-027 
and PGL11-006, equates to about 9 months of treatment and monitoring),of whom 457 subjects 
were exposed to four 3-month treatment courses in completed study to 5 or 10 mg/day (which, 
when taking account of off-treatment intervals, equates to 21 months of treatment and 
monitoring). 
In  the  ongoing  Study  PGL11-024  (PEARL  extension  2),  the  extension  of  PGL09-027,  64 subjects  have 
continued for further 4 additional treatment courses with ulipristal acetate 10 mg/day, and so far 53 have 
completed additional  4  courses (i.e. a  total  of  8  treatment courses). 
Since the initial Marketing Authorisation in 2012 and at the cut-off date of 22 February 2015 (in line with 
next PSUR 06), Esmya marketing exposure is estimated at around 165,800 patients. 
The study design and the number of subjects exposed to ulipristal acetate in the phase 3 studies are 
summarised in Table 15.

a  Protocol specified two co-primary safety endpoints. 
b  132 subjects (from the PGL09-026 population) were included in the safety population, but only 131 received ulipristal 
acetate during Study PGL09-027 (1 subject received placebo [double blind treatment] only instead of ulipristal 
acetate). 
c  Each course separated by 10 days of treatment with placebo or progestin [NETA] followed by a drug-free period. 
d  Each course separated by a drug-free period until the start of the second menstruation following the end of the 
previous treatment course. 
A summary of the exposure to ulipristal acetate for ≥ 6 months (two or more intermittent 3-month 
treatment courses) in completed studies is presented in Table 16 below.

Adverse events 
In Study PGL11-006 AEs were classified as: 
–  On-treatment TEAEs were defined as events whose start date was on or after the first dose of study 
medication, up to and including 7 days after the last dose of study medication within each treatment 
course. On-treatment TEAEs were summarised by treatment course. 
–  Off-treatment TEAEs were defined as those whose start date was more than 7 days after the last 
dose of study medication within each treatment course and prior to the start of the next treatment 
course. Off-treatment TEAEs were summarised by treatment course. 
On-treatment TEAEs 
The proportion of patients reporting on-treatment TEAEs was higher during the first treatment course 
(44.3% in both groups) than during the second treatment course (27.4% and 29.8% in the 5 mg/day group 
and 10 mg/day group, respectively). The most frequently reported on-treatment TEAE was headache 
followed by hot flush in both treatment courses 1 and 2.  
The majority of TEAEs of headache were mild or moderate in intensity, with the exception of 3 severe events 
reported in 2 (0.9%) subjects. All the TEAEs of hot flush were mild or moderate in intensity. During 
treatment course 1, in addition to headache and hot flush, on-treatment TEAEs occurring at a frequency of 
≥2% included influenza (in 3.8% of subjects), breast pain/tenderness/discomfort (in 2.7% of subjects), 
nausea (in 2.7% of subjects), nasopharyngitis and fatigue (both in 2.2% of subjects), and pelvic pain (in 
2.0% of subjects). No other TEAEs occurred at a frequency of ≥2% in any treatment group during treatment 
course 2. 
More on-treatment TEAEs were reported during treatment course 1 than during treatment courses 2, 3 and 
4. In general, the number of subjects reporting on-treatment TEAEs by SOC and PT were similar for the 
PGL4001 5 mg and 10 mg groups.

Off-treatment TEAEs  
In Study PGL11-006 Part I, a total of 169 off-treatment TEAEs were reported in 106 (23.5%) patients with 
similar frequency in the two treatment groups. Off-treatment periods went from >7 days after the last dose 
of treatment course 1 to the beginning of treatment course 2, and from >7 days after the last dose of

treatment course 2 to Visit 8. Fewer off-treatment TEAEs were reported following treatment course 2 than 
treatment course 1. 
The only TEAEs reported in more than 2% of patients during any off-treatment interval were dysmenorrhoea 
(in 5 [2.2%] and 8 [3.6%] subjects in the 5 mg/day and 10 mg/day groups, respectively) and menorrhagia 
(in 8 [3.5%] and 3 [1.4%] subjects in the 5 mg/day and 10 mg/day groups, respectively). The TEAEs were 
mainly mild or moderate in severity. Six (1.3%) subjects experienced severe events, all of which were also 
SAEs. 
Following treatment course 4, including the time up to the end of study follow-up visit (visit 12), 
dysmenorrhoea was reported by 4 and 8 (4.6%) subjects from the PGL4001 5 mg and 10 mg groups, 
respectively, and headache by 4 and 1 subjects from the PGL4001 5 mg and 10 mg groups, respectively; no 
other TEAEs were reported with a frequency of ≥2%. 
The number of subjects reporting off-treatment TEAEs by SOC and PT were similar for the PGL4001 5 mg 
and 10 mg groups. More off-treatment TEAEs were reported following treatment courses 1 and 4, than 
following treatment courses 2 and 3. 
Treatment–Related Adverse Events 
Overall, 259 on-treatment adverse events in 112 (24.8%) subjects were considered by the Investigators to 
be ulipristal acetate-related in study PGL11-006 Part I. None of the treatment-related TEAEs were SAEs. 
Table 19: On-Treatment, TEAEs Occurring in ≥2% of Subjects in any Treatment Course Presented by 
System Organ Class, Preferred Term, Treatment Course and Treatment Group (Safety Set, Study 
PGL11-006) 
Adverse drug reactions 
The main outputs used for determining the nature and incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were the 
pooled table of treatment-related adverse events (AE’s) reported during study treatment in phase III clinical 
studies (PEARL I-II, III and IV). The data from the Phase III studies were pooled to increase the precision of 
the adverse drug reactions rates. When reviewing AE’s reported during the Phase III trials, it became 
Assessment report  
EMA/341144/2015 
Page 43/74 
 
  
  
 
apparent that there was only a slight difference in the overall incidence of AE’s between subjects receiving 
ulipristal acetate 5 mg once daily or 10 mg once daily. Therefore, it was decided to pool data from the 5 mg 
and 10 mg treatment groups for the purpose of calculating the overall incidence of ADRs. When comparing 
repeated treatment courses, overall adverse reactions rate was less frequent in subsequent treatment 
courses than during the first one and each adverse reaction was less frequent or remained in the same 
frequency category (except for dyspepsia and genital discharge who were classified as uncommon in 
treatment course 3 based on one subject occurrence). Hence, the highest potential frequency of adverse 
drug reactions for any given 3-month course (i.e. frequency of treatment course 1) is presented in the 
SmPC. 
All on-treatment AEs for ulipristal acetate reported as treatment related by the investigators were reviewed 
and a thorough causality assessment between the medicinal product and the AE was made, taking into 
account at least a reasonable possibility of causal relationship. All AEs reported by the clinical investigators 
as treatment related were considered to be ADRs unless any of the following pertained: The ADR was 
reported at same or higher rate in patients receiving placebo in study PGL07-021 than in patients receiving 
ulipristal acetate; The ADR was reported at a higher rate in the comparator arm of study PGL07-022, and 
there were no event in the ulipristal acetate treatment groups in study PGL07-021; The ADR was 
subsequently found to be a misdiagnosis, and it was more appropriate to include a different AE term; The 
ADR was related to an underlying medical history or a laboratory test, abnormality, and review of all 
available laboratory data did not confirm any signals or trends of abnormal values in the ulipristal acetate 
treatment groups. For few cases, if the particular event was reported for one subject only in the entire Phase 
III database in ulipristal acetate groups, it was excluded if it comprised terms relating to natural disease 
progression, or medical judgment indicated that a relationship to ulipristal acetate was implausible; In 
addition, there were many isolated cases of different AE terms in the system, organ class (SOC), “Infections 
and Infestations” randomly but evenly distributed across treatment groups. The incidence rate of those AE 
terms was similar or lower to placebo or comparator group and all AEs in this SOC were excluded. 
No new adverse drug reactions were detected based on safety data from study PGL11-006. The frequency of 
the following ADRs was revised based on the crude incidence rate in the pooled ADRs reported by 
investigators with both doses of ulipristal acetate across three Phase III studies: Epistaxis, Dyspepsia, 
Flatulence, Hyperhidrosis, Ovarian cyst ruptured, Breast swelling, Uterine haemorrhage, Oedema, Weight 
increased, Blood cholesterol increased. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Reproductive and Breast Disorders 
In Study PGL11-006 Part I, TEAEs from the reproductive system and breast disorders SOC were the most 
common on-treatment TEAEs during treatment course 2 while during treatment course 1 TEAEs from the 
nervous system were more common. Overall, TEAEs from the reproductive system and breast disorder SOC 
were reported in more subjects during treatment course 1 than in treatment course 2. Hot flush was the 
TEAE most frequently reported. Among the off-treatment TEAEs, those from the reproductive and breast 
disorders SOC were always the most common. The most frequently reported TEAEs were dysmenorrhea 
followed by menorraghia. 
Breast Disorders 
Breast pain was the only breast disorder occurring in ≥ 1% of subjects during treatment course 1. During 
treatment course 2, breast pain was reported only in the 5 mg/day group (in 0.9% of patients). 
Excessive Uterine Bleeding 
In Study PGL11-006 Part I, over the 2 repeated intermittent treatment courses, 21 subjects out of 451 
subjects included, reported 24 AEs related to bleeding, of which 5 were SAEs and occurred in the off-drug 
Assessment report  
EMA/341144/2015 
Page 44/74 
 
  
  
interval at the time when menstruation is expected. These AEs were mainly metrorrhagia and menorrhagia. 
In addition, one SAE of heavy menstrual bleeding was reported from ongoing PGL11-006 Part II after third 
treatment course. 
The frequency of TEAEs related to excessive uterine bleeding did not increase with the number of treatment 
courses in Studies PGL09-027 and Study PGL11-006. TEAEs were reported in: 
–  4 (3.1%) subjects in Study PGL09-027 and 11 (2.6%) subjects (7 [3.2%] and 4 [2.0%] in the 5 
mg/day and 10 mg/day groups, respectively) in Study PGL11-006 during and after treatment course 
2, 
–  2 (1.7%) subjects in Study PGL09-027 during and after treatment course 3, 
–  2 (1.9%) subjects in Study PGL09-027 during and after treatment course 4. 
Endometrial Hyperplasia and Hypertrophy  
In Study PGL11-006 Part I, TEAEs of endometrial hyperplasia were reported in 1 (0.2%) subject during 
treatment course 1 with 5 mg, and in 4 (0.9%) subjects (off-treatment after the treatment course 1 with 5 
mg/day), from those 4, only 1 diagnosis was confirmed by expert pathologists. Endometrial hypertrophy 
was reported as off-treatment TEAE in 1 subject in the 10 mg/day group (after treatment course 1). Results 
of endometrial biopsies and effects of treatment on endometrial thickness are discussed in more detail 
below. 
Hot Flushes and Other Castration-Related Symptoms 
In Study PGL11-006 Part I, castration-related TEAEs were hot flush, depression, depressive mood, 
decreased libido and vaginal infection. Hot flush was overall reported as on-treatment TEAE in 34 (7.5%) 
subjects (8 of them experienced hot flush in both treatment courses). Depression was overall reported in 5 
(1.1%) subjects and depressive mood in 3 (0.7%) subjects. Decreased libido was overall reported in 3 
(0.7%) subjects, vaginal infection in 2 (0.4%) subjects. 
There was no trend of an increase in castration-related TEAEs with repeated courses of treatment with 
ulipristal acetate, similar to observations in Study PGL09-027. 
Ovarian Cysts 
In Study PGL11-006 Part I, the presence of cysts was assessed by transvaginal ultrasound at screening 3, 
Visits 6, 7 and 8. Overall, normal ovaries were observed for >89% of subjects at all visits. Follicular cysts 
seen on 2 or more consecutive visits were observed for 7 subjects in the 5 mg/day group and for 7 subjects 
in the 10 mg/day group. 
One subject in the 5 mg/day group had endometrioma on the left ovary reported at Visit 6, at an 
unscheduled visit 1 month later, and at early termination visit 2 weeks later. This was clinically significant 
and reported as a TEAE of ovarian cyst, was treated with surgery and resolved 2 months later. Another 
subject in the 5 mg/day group had endometrioma on the right ovary at screening (considered as clinically 
significant) and at Visit 6 (considered as non-clinically significant), but was reported as having a normal 
transvaginal ultrasound of ovaries thereafter. 
One subject in the 10 mg/day group had a moderate TEAE of ovarian cyst during treatment course 2 that 
was considered related to study treatment. In addition, a total of 4 off-treatment TEAEs of ovarian cysts 
were reported in 4 subjects. All these events resolved, two were considered as related to the treatment (1 
subject in the 5 mg/day group). 
Dysmenorrhea 
Assessment report  
EMA/341144/2015 
Page 45/74 
 
  
  
Dysmenorrhea was overall reported in 2 subjects in study PGL11-006 Part I: 1 subject in the 5 mg/day group 
during treatment course 1 and 1 subject in the 10 mg/day group during treatment course 2. Off-treatment 
TEAEs of dysmenorrhoea were more common than on-treatment TEAEs. Dysmenorrhoea was reported in 13 
(2.9%) subjects overall, 10 after treatment course 1 and 4 after treatment course 2.  
Acne 
Twelve TEAEs of acne were overall reported in 9 (2.0%) subjects in study PGL11-006 Part I. The TEAEs of 
acne reported were mild or moderate in severity and all of them were considered as treatment-related. No 
off-treatment TEAEs of acne were reported in any treatment group. 
Nervous System Disorders  
In study PGL11-006 Part I, headache was the most frequently reported on-treatment TEAE for both 
treatment courses 1 and 2, but the proportion of subjects experiencing headache was higher in treatment 
course 1 (overall 9.8%) than in treatment course 2 (overall 4.3%). None of the TEAEs of headache were 
serious and the majority were mild or moderate in intensity, with 3 severe events in 2 subjects. 
Cardiac and Vascular Disorders  
In study PGL11-006 Part I, the incidence of TEAEs from the cardiac and vascular disorders SOCs was low. 
The most common TEAE was hypertension (reported in treatment course 1 in > 1% of subjects in both 
treatment groups). These were reported as hypertension, although no data are available to assess whether 
these were confirmed hypertension cases versus single occurrence of high blood pressure. 
Results of vital sign and ECG monitoring did not raise any concerns regarding cardiac safety. 
Gastrointestinal Disorders 
The most common gastrointestinal TEAE was nausea, followed by abdominal pain and toothache in study 
PGL11-006 Part I. The incidence was lower during treatment course 2 than during treatment course 1. 
Hepatobiliary Disorders and Liver Safety 
On-treatment TEAEs from the hepatobiliary disorders SOC were reported only in the 10 mg/day group 
(study PGL11-006 Part I). Two events of cholelithiasis were reported in 2 subjects during treatment course 
1 and 2 events of liver disorders were reported in 1 subject during treatment course 1 and 1 subject during 
treatment course 2. In the investigations SOC, a few cases of on-treatment TEAEs related to abnormal liver 
function were reported, with increases in ALT, gamma-GT, AST and blood alkaline phosphatase. The 
majority of these events were reported during treatment course 1. No cases of hepatobiliary disorders were 
reported after treatment course 3 and 4. 
Endometrial safety 
Endometrial thickness 
Endometrial thickness was measured by ultrasound in Study PGL11-006, at screening, 10-18 days after 
start of menses following treatment course 1 (Visit 6), in the last 8 days of treatment course 2 (Visit 7) and 
10-18 days after start of menses following treatment course 2 (Visit 8). 
The mean endometrial thickness was similar at all visits including screening, ranging from 8.4 to 8.8 in the 
5 mg/day group and from 7.9 to 9.5 in the 10 mg/day group. The number of subjects with a thickness 
>16 mm rose from 22 (4.9%) subjects at screening to 31 (7.4%) subjects at Visit 6 (10 to 18 days after 
start of menstruation following end of treatment course 1), before returning to levels similar to screening at 
Visit 7 (20 [4.9%] at the end of treatment course 2), and decreasing to 13 (3.4%) subjects at Visit 8 (10 to 
Assessment report  
EMA/341144/2015 
Page 46/74 
 
  
  
 
18 days after start of menstruation following end of treatment course 2). There were no major differences 
between the two treatment groups in terms of endometrial thickness. 
Endometrial hypertrophy was reported as an off-treatment TEAE in 1 subject in the 10 mg/day group (after 
treatment course 1). 
The individual endometrial thickness values over time for subjects (n=42) with an endometrial thickness ≤ 
16 mm at screening and at least one assessment of endometrial thickness > 16 mm post-screening were 
also presented for the safety population (study PGL11-006 Part I). Subjects had occasionally an endometrial 
thickness > 16 mm. As expected, some subjects have an increased thickness after 1 course of treatment 
(Visit 6) but return to normal thickness after 2 courses of treatment (Visit 7). Some subjects presented still 
with normal endometrial thickness after 1 course of treatment, an increased thickness after 2 courses and 
came back to normal thickness after one menstruation post treatment (visit 8). Only three subjects had an 
endometrial thickness > 16 mm at all visits up to Visit 8. The MAH carefully looked at the data after Visit 8 
of these individual patients (PGL11-006 ongoing Part II). The endometrial thickness of all 3 subjects 
ultimately decreased < 16 mm, at Visit 9 for 2 of them and Visit 10 for the last subject.  
The final CSR was provided during the procedure. Endometrial safety data for Part I and Part II are 
summarised in the table below.

Endometrial biopsies 
Endometrial biopsies were performed in Study PGL11-006 at screening, approximately 4 weeks after 
baseline if screening biopsy was not adequate (Visit 3) and 10-18 days after start of menses following 
treatment course 2 (Visit 8).  
All biopsies in Phase III studies were reviewed by the same three expert pathologists from the original 
workshop (NICHD sponsored workshop performed in 2006 to address “Progesterone Receptor Modulators 
and the Endometrium”) using a form designed to facilitate reporting of PAEC. The pathologists were blinded 
to treatment and timing of biopsy collection, as well as diagnosis made by their colleagues. 
The pathologists used a rating scale to assess the endometrium biopsies, which required the following: 
• 
judge whether the specimens were adequate or not, 
•  make a primary diagnosis of either benign endometrium (further classified as atrophy, inactive, 
proliferative, secretory, menstrual or non-physiological), hyperplasia (further classified as simple or 
complex atypical or non-atypical) or malignant neoplasm (further classified as endometrial 
adenocarcinoma or other malignant neoplasm), 
Assessment report  
EMA/341144/2015 
Page 49/74 
 
  
  
 
 
 
• 
observe whether polyps were absent or present (if present, further classified as benign, hyperplastic 
or carcinomatous). 
Only one pathologist was required to find a specimen adequate for it to be included in the analysis. For the 
primary diagnosis and the observation of polyps, the main diagnosis reported was the consensus of opinion 
of at least 2 out of 3 pathologists, or, if all pathologists reported a different finding, the most severe 
diagnosis was reported. After making the primary diagnosis, the pathologists were required to assess 
whether there were any non-physiological changes, and to describe these. 
The biopsy taken at screening was read by a pathologist at the Central Clinical Laboratory to confirm 
eligibility. Results were then sent back to the site. If the screening endometrium biopsy results were not 
available at visit 2, the Investigator was told to contact the Clinical Research Associate who provided 
instructions on how to document and, if applicable, proceed with the inclusion of the subject. If the screening 
biopsy was taken but confirmed as not adequate by the Central Clinical Laboratory (because of no tissue or 
endocervical tissue or technically inadequate) at the time of inclusion, the subject was requested to repeat 
the biopsy at visit 3. 
Visit 8, visit 11 and visit 12 biopsies were also read by a pathologist at the Central Clinical Laboratory. 
Results were communicated to the site immediately in case of atypia or adenocarcinoma. 
In order to get a better understanding of the reversibility of PAECs after the end of treatment, biopsies were 
taken after one menstrual bleed after end of treatment (visit 8 and visit 11) and at the follow-up visit (visit 
12). 
Results from Part I and Part II of Study PGL11-006 
In Study PGL11-006 prior to inclusion, of 555 subjects screened, 8 subjects (1.44%) were excluded from the 
study prior to treatment start due to a diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia. Overall, 451 subjects started 
the first treatment course.  
At screening in Study PGL11-006, a total of 450 of 451 subjects provided an endometrium biopsy and, of 
these, 422 (93.8%) were considered adequate for histology review. Endometrium biopsy consensus review 
provided a diagnosis of benign endometrium for all (100%) samples; the only other observations were 
benign polyps in 7 (1.7%) subjects. 
The final CSR included 293 adequate biopsies taken after 4 treatment courses (Visit 11) and 286 adequate 
biopsies taken 3 months after the end of the fourth and last 3- month treatment course (Visit 12). Cases 
of hyperplasia/malignant neoplasia diagnosed by consensus in adequate biopsies in study PGL11-006 are 
presented in table 23. 
In addition to cases of hyperplasia captured at nominated protocol visits, one consensus diagnosis of simple 
atypical hyperplasia was reported following the unscheduled histology review of material taken by curettage 
following the SAE of menorrhagia following treatment course 1. At early termination visit approximately 1 
month later this subject had a consensus diagnosis of benign endometrium. 
Overall, 6 cases of hyperplasia were diagnosed in 451 subjects treated with ulipristal acetate 5 or 10 mg and 
undergoing repeated endometrium biopsies: 
- 
For one subject, hyperplasia (simple atypical) was diagnosed after menstruation following end of 
treatment course 1. The subject discontinued study and a control biopsy at early termination visit, a month 
later showed benign endometrium. 
- 
For three subjects, hyperplasia (simple atypical, simple non- atypical, simple non-atypical) were 
diagnosed after menstruation following end of treatment course 2 (V8). Subjects continued in the study and 
Assessment report  
EMA/341144/2015 
Page 50/74 
 
  
  
received two additional 3-months treatment courses. All three subject’s next biopsy (V11) indicated full 
disappearance of hyperplasia. 
- 
For one subject, hyperplasia (complex atypical) was diagnosed after return of menstruation 
following end of-treatment course 4 (V11), she continued in the study and a control biopsy three months 
after treatment completion (V12) showed benign endometrium. 
- 
For one subject, hyperplasia (complex non-atypical) was diagnosed 3 months following end of 
treatment course 4 (V12), therefore at end of study. Of note, at previous biopsy performed after return of 
menstruation following end of treatment course 4 (V11), her endometrium was rated as “benign 
endometrium” by all central and expert pathologists. 
No particular pathologic bleeding pattern for subjects could be identified for the 6 cases of hyperplasia. No 
endometrium thickening above 16 mm was reported for any of these 6 subjects at the time of hyperplasia 
diagnosis. There was generally a good agreement between pathologists on the presence of hyperplasia, but 
some disagreement on the level of atypia.  
In long-term Phase III studies (PGL09-026/027 and PGL11-006), the total number of biopsies after 4 
treatment courses was 378 and the total number of biopsies 3 months after discontinuation of 4 treatment 
courses was 380. Excluding PGL09-027 UPA+NETA subjects, the total number of biopsies after 4 treatment 
courses is 340 and the total number of biopsies 3 months after discontinuation of 4 treatment courses is 318.

Frequency of hyperplasia  
Prior to any treatment a prevalence of endometrial hyperplasia of 1.82% was reported in the target 
population, which is expected considering patients were recruited based on myoma associated with 
abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) and the age group of women with symptomatic myoma (i.e. > 50% above 
40 years old) and the well-established relationship between both AUB and age with endometrial hyperplasia 
in pre-menopausal women (Lacey, 2012; Iram, 2010). 
Assessment report  
EMA/341144/2015

During treatment, sporadic cases of endometrial hyperplasia were recorded in all treatment groups, 
whatever the duration of treatment. Hyperplasia spontaneously occurs in this population demonstrated by 
one case of atypical hyperplasia in the placebo group and one case of simple hyperplasia following 
GnRH-agonist treatment. 
The frequency was very low and comparable between groups as detailed in Table 24 (0.45% to 2.56%). The 
frequency of hyperplasia in all short-term and long-term Phase III studies excluding subjects exposed to 
NETA was calculated using an ITT approach (conservative approach for frequency calculation, whereby a 
subject is counted only once in the denominator despite providing up to three post treatment biopsies), 
meaning that the denominator is composed of all subjects with at least one adequate biopsy having been 
exposed to UPA or comparator whatever the duration of treatment. With this approach, the frequency is 
0.89% (7/789) (95% CI 0.36% to 1.82%) for hyperplasia and 0.38% (3/789) (95% CI 0.08% to 1.11%) for 
hyperplasia with atypia.

Applying HRT guideline EMEA/CHMP/021/97 Rev.1, the correct calculation of hyperplasia incidence rate for 
4 repeated intermittent treatment courses with ulipristal acetate (i.e. an observational period of 18 months) 
is 0.59% (95% CI 0.07% to 2.12%; NETA subjects excluded). If prevalence at one year overall treatment 
duration is considered, prevalence rate for hyperplasia and atypical hyperplasia is 0.3% (95% CI 0.01% to 
1.64%), i.e. 1 subject with complex atypical hyperplasia at Visit 11 (PGL11-006) out of now 340 biopsies 
after 4  treatment courses (NETA exposed subjects excluded). 
No endometrial carcinoma occurred in this population and consequently the incidence rate for endometrial 
carcinoma is 0% with a two-sided 95% CI of 0% to 1.09%. 
Whichever population is considered, incidence rate over 18 months, prevalence and frequency of 
hyperplasia with ulipristal acetate are below 1% and the upper level of the respective confidence interval is 
always below 2.5%. 
The calculated prevalence of hyperplasia per number of treatment courses in short-term and long-term studies 
is presented in Table 25 After two treatment courses, which is currently the approved duration of treatment, 
hyperplasia was observed in 0.83% of subjects which is in line with the prevalence of hyperplasia in comparator 
groups, the target population and in published literature. There is no increase of hyperplasia prevalence with 
repetition of treatment courses.

In addition the applicant performed a Biopsy Interim Snapshot (cut-off date of 06th November 2014) of the 
ongoing Study PGL11-024. Study PGL11-024 is an extension study of Study PGL09-026/027 providing up to 
a total of 8 repeated intermittent treatment courses.  
Of the 42 adequate biopsies from the 47 subjects exposed to 8 treatment courses (Visit III), 100% of 
biopsies had a diagnosis of benign endometrium. Of the 21 subjects who underwent a follow-up biopsy (Visit 
IV; only if non- adequate biopsy at Visit III or a diagnosis of other than benign physiologic endometrium by 
at least 1 of the 3 expert pathologists), 19 biopsies were adequate and all (100%) were diagnosed as benign 
endometrium. 
Comparison of the incidence rate with the baseline incidence in healthy women of premenopausal age 
reported in public literature 
The applicant performed a literature research on PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar and Scopus document 
search. No publication could be identified that provided incidence rates in a premenopausal population. The 
incidence of hyperplasia in a healthy pre-menopausal population without gynaecological symptoms, is not 
well established. These women do not routinely undergo endometrial biopsies, curettage or hysterectomies. 
Incidence rates of hyperplasia were only found for postmenopausal women under hormone replacement 
therapy. A study including 3006 women with abnormal uterine bleeding, aged from 30 to 50 years, reported 
that the incidence of hyperplasia increased with increasing age (Iram et al., 2010). 
Totally 13 publications were however considered relevant for prevalence rate calculation. The prevalence of 
endometrial hyperplasia in a premenopausal population in the reviewed publications ranges from 2% to 
25.3% with 0.03% to 1.26% for atypical hyperplasia. 
For ulipristal acetate prevalence calculation: 
Considering prevalence is “a figure for a factor at a single point in time” (Shields, 2003), if prevalence at one 
year overall treatment duration is considered, prevalence rate for hyperplasia and atypical hyperplasia is 
0.3% ((95% CI 0.01% to 1.64%), i.e. 1 subject with complex atypical hyperplasia at Visit 11 (PGL11-006) 
out of 338 biopsies after 4 treatment courses (PGL09-027 and PGL11-024, NETA exposed subjects 
excluded). 
If calculating the frequency of hyperplasia using the previously explained “ITT approach”, (conservative 
approach for frequency calculation, whereby a subject is counted only once in the denominator despite 
providing up to three post treatment biopsies), the frequency of hyperplasia in all Phase III studies 
(short-term and long-term) excluding subjects exposed to NETA is 0.89% (7/789) (95% CI 0.36% to 
1.82%) for hyperplasia and 0.38% (3/789) (95% CI 0.08% to 1.11%) for hyperplasia with atypia. This 
conservative approach is still well below the reported prevalence in the identified publications.

The hyperplasia incidence after ulipristal acetate treatment and prevalence compares well to published 
literature. Repetition of ulipristal acetate treatment courses does not increase the occurrence of endometrial 
findings, i.e. hyperplasia with or without atypia or adenocarcinoma. 
Non-Physiological Endometrial Changes (referred as PAEC) 
The pathologists were asked to record any non-physiological changes, including PAEC features such as: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
epithelial changes (further classified as secretion, mitoses or apoptotic changes),  
presence of extensive cysts, 
unusual vascular changes (further classified as chicken-wire capillaries, thick-walled vessels or 
ectatic vessels), 
any other observations.  
At screening in Study PGL11-006, in 422 biopsies adequate for review, at least 2 pathologists reported 
non-physiological changes compatible with PAEC in a total of 34 (8.1%) biopsies.  
At Visit 8 (10 to 18 days after the start of menstruation following treatment course 2), in biopsies adequate 
for review from 360 subjects, at least 2 pathologists reported non-physiological changes in a total of 64 
(17.8%) biopsies, 29 (16.3%) biopsies from the 5 mg/day group and 35 (19.2%) biopsies from the 10 
mg/day group.  
In the PGL11-006 Part II interim analysis, for Visit 11, in 122 biopsies adequate for review, at least 2 
pathologists reported non-physiological changes in a total of 25 (20.5%) biopsies, 17 (24.6%) biopsies from 
the PGL4001 5 mg group and 8 (15.1%) biopsies from the PGL4001 10 mg group. 
For Visit 12, in 39 biopsies adequate for review, at least 2 pathologists reported non-physiological changes 
in a total of 4 (10.3%) biopsies, 2 (8.7%) biopsies from the PGL4001 5 mg group and 2 (12.5%) biopsies 
from the PGL4001 10 mg group. 
In the ulipristal acetate Phase III studies, non-physiological features were shown to occur at baseline prior 
to any exposure to ulipristal acetate in 2 to 14 % (if taken the evaluation of at least 2 out of 3 pathologists). 
When biopsies were taken under treatment, these non-physiological changes were seen in approximately 
60% of biopsies (Studies PGL07-021 and PGL07-022). After only one menstrual bleed, the frequency of 
non-physiological features decreased to below 30% (Study PGL09-026). Within 3 to 6 months after end of 
treatment (Part B Studies PGL07-021 and PGL07-022, and Study PGL09-026) they decreased to baseline 
frequency. 
Repeated intermittent 3-month courses of ulipristal acetate did not increase the occurrence of PAEC (Studies 
PGL09-027 and PGL11-006). The frequency of non-physiological changes after four 3- month treatment 
courses was lower to the frequency observed after two treatment courses (Visit 8; 16.3% and 19.2% for the 
5 mg and 10 mg group respectively) see Table below. After a follow-up period of approximately 3 months 
after the end of the four treatment courses, the occurrence of non-physiological changes was comparable to 
screening values with 9.3% and 6.1% for the 5 mg and 10 mg respectively.

agreement (Studies PGL09-027, PGL11-006 2nd Biopsies Interim analysis – November 2014)

Menstruation returned quickly after end of treatment in both treatment groups in Study PGL11-006 (Part I). 
Following treatment course 1, the mean (median) time to return of menstruation for subjects in the PGL4001 
5 mg and 10 mg groups was 24.7 (23.0) and 27.7 (27.0) days, respectively. Following treatment course 2, 
the mean (median) time to return of menstruation for subjects in the PGL4001 5 mg and 10 mg groups was 
28.2 (26.0) and 30.5 (28.0) days, respectively. Six subjects had not returned to menstruation 90 days after 
end of treatment, which as per protocol led to their withdrawal. Following discontinuation of treatment 
course 3, the mean (median) time to return of menstruation for the 186 subjects in the PGL4001 5 mg group 
was 29.1 (27.0) days, and for the 180 subjects in the PGL4001 10 mg group the mean (median) was 30.8 
(28.5) days. Following treatment course 4, the mean (median) time to return of menstruation for the 174 
subjects in the PGL4001 5 mg group was 28.5 (27.0) days, and for the 168 subjects in the PGL4001 10 mg 
group the mean (median) was 32.7 (29.0) days. 
In all the short-term and long-term Phase III studies the majority of subjects returned to menstruation 
quickly after the end of treatment(s) with ulipristal acetate. The mean duration was 27-34 days in 
short-term, 24.9-33.2 days in long-term Study PGL09-026/027 in placebo group after treatment course 4.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
During the study, 16 (3.5%) subjects reported 18 on-treatment SAEs, 2 of which were considered treatment 
related, and 13 (2.9%) subjects reported 16 off-treatment SAEs, 11 of which were considered 
PGL4001-related. The most commonly reported SAE was menorrhagia, reported for 6 subjects, of which one 
was considered unrelated to PGL4001 (considered an AESI), and 4 subjects had the SAE of uterine 
leiomyoma reported, (2 reports of “myoma in status nascendi”, 1 report of “partial expulsion of uterine 
myoma” and 1 report of “necrosis of myoma node”), all considered PGL4001-related.  
Eleven treatment emergent AESI were reported for 11 (2.4%) subjects, 9 of which were non-serious and 
included: 4 reports of endometrial hyperplasia which were diagnosed following curettage to treat the SAE of 
menorrhagia (all 4 reports for subjects from the PGL4001 5 mg group); 2 reports of menorrhagia; 1 report 
of endometrial hypertrophy; and 2 reports of clinical laboratory abnormalities (one of increased alkaline 
phosphatase and one of liver function test abnormalities without evidence of liver function impairment). One 
SAE/AESI of endometrial cancer was reported, but there is evidence that this was a pre-existing condition.

In the on-going study PGL11-024, one SAE was reported until the 31 May 2014 cut-off date.  “Crossed fused 
right renal ectopia” (PT: ectopic kidney) was reported for a child exposed to ulipristal acetate 10 mg once 
daily in utero for approximately one month.  The investigator assessed the event to be unrelated to ulipristal 
acetate treatment. The role of concomitant drugs used by mother at the beginning of first trimester like 
domperidone and tetrazepam could not be excluded. The incidence of ectopic kidney reported in the 
literature is 1:7000 (Narci A et al, 2010). 
No deaths were reported during treatment with ulipristal acetate in any completed studies. 
Two deaths were reported in the ongoing study PGL11-006 Part II: one due to murder and the other was an 
accidental death; none of them considered by Investigators as related to the study treatment. 
Laboratory findings 
The mean (median) Hb value at screening was 12.27 (12.50) g/dL (Safety Set, normal range 11.5 to 15.5 
g/dL); 12.26 (12.55) g/dL for subjects from the PGL4001 5 mg group and 12.29 (12.40) g/dL for subjects 
from the PGL4001 10 mg group. At visits 3 to 10, Hb levels were increased compared to screening values, 
reaching a peak at visit 10 (end of treatment course 4), with mean (median) levels of 13.16 (13.20) g/dL 
(Safety Set overall); levels for the PGL4001 5 mg and 10 mg groups were 13.02 (13.10) g/dL and 13.31 
(13.35) g/dL, respectively. At visit 12 end of study follow-up, the mean (median) Hb value was 12.90 
(13.10) g/dL (Safety Set). 
As expected, the number of subjects with Hb levels less than lower limit of normal (<LLN) decreased during 
the study, with a total of 32 (7.9%) subjects with levels <LLN at visit 7 (end of treatment course 2), and 26 
(7.7%) subjects with levels <LLN at visit 10 (end of treatment course 4), compared to 115 (26.1%) subjects 
at visit 2, the start of treatment course 1.  
At visit 2 (prior to receiving treatment at the start of treatment course 1), 164 (72.9%) subjects from the 
PGL4001 5 mg group and 162 (75.0%) subjects from the PGL4001 10 mg group had Hb levels within the 
normal range. At visit 10, 152 (89.9%) and 159 (94.6%) subjects from the PGL4001 5 mg and 10 mg 
groups, respectively, had Hb levels within the normal range. 
The mean Hct value at screening was 0.40. Hct levels increased from screening to reach a peak of 0.42 at 
Visit 7 and visit 10. Similarly, the number of subject with Hct levels <LLN decreased at each successive study 
visit.  
The mean (median) values for both AST (normal range 0 to 37 U/L) and ALT (normal range 0 to 47 U/L) from 
screening and throughout the study did not vary greatly, with little difference between the PGL4001 5 mg 
and 10 mg groups. 
At screening and visit 2 (prior to treatment administration at the start of treatment course 1), 11 (2.5%) 
subjects presented high AST values at both visits, and 6 (1.3%) and 7 (1.6%) subjects presented high ALT 
values at these visits (Table 52). At visit 5 (during the last 8 days of treatment course 1), the numbers of 
high values (>ULN) observed were 17 (4.0%) and 18 (4.2%) subjects for AST and ALT, respectively. At 
subsequent visits up to visit 12, the number of subjects with high values (>ULN) of AST ranged between 4 
subjects at visits 6 and 9, and 10 (2.5%) subjects at visit 7. The number of subjects with high values (>ULN) 
of ALT ranged between 2 subjects at visit 9 and 7 (2.0%) subjects at visit 10. Shift tables describing the 
changes to numbers of AST/ALT values with respect to the normal range observed during the study for the 
overall Safety Set are provided in Section 14.1.6, Table 14.3.16. 
Lipids were measured at screening and Visits 7, 10 and 12. At Visit 7, the mean levels of total cholesterol 
were slightly higher compared with at screening. A total of 185 (41.4%) subjects had total cholesterol levels 
>ULN at screening; at visits 7, 10 and 12, the corresponding figures were 221 (54.3%), 206 (60.1%) and 
Assessment report  
EMA/341144/2015

177(52.7%) subjects, respectively, with total cholesterol levels >ULN. Levels of triglycerides increased 
slightly during the study. At screening a total of 57 (12.8%) subjects had levels of triglycerides which were 
>ULN, corresponding numbers at visits 7, 10 and 12 were 81 (19.9%), 67 (19.5%) and 53 (15.8%) 
subjects. 
The majority of subjects maintained normal levels of triglycerides and HDL, and high levels of LDL from 
baseline to Visit 7. The ratio of total cholesterol / HDL cholesterol was evaluated (post-hoc analysis). The 
ratio of total cholesterol / HDL cholesterol was always <4. At screening, the mean ratio of total cholesterol 
/ HDL cholesterol was 3.30 and 3.38 for subjects in the 5 mg/day and 10 mg/day groups, respectively, and 
at Visit 7 corresponding ratios were 3.44 and 3.44, respectively. 
No trends for changes in other biochemistry parameters were observed. 
Coagulation parameters were measured at screening. Only 1 subject had an on-treatment out of normal 
range value. This subject had a high APTT value one month in treatment course 1 at a repeated screening 
test (i.e. 42.1 seconds; normal range 27.0 to 40.0 seconds), but prothrombin time and INR were within 
normal ranges. 
Blood glucose levels were not routinely measured in this study, but no TEAEs of change in glucose levels or 
glucose metabolism were reported. 
Measurement of estradiol (E2), FSH and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was performed at screening and 
for E2 at visit 7. There were no identifiable trends in estradiol levels and very few on-treatment values of E2 
outside the normal range. Increases in E2 levels of clinical relevance (normal range of E2, 0 to 399 pg/mL) 
at visit 7 were seen for a total of 7 subjects from the PGL4001 group and 3 subjects from the PGL4001 10 mg 
group, and at visit 10 were seen for 4 subjects from the PGL4001 5 mg group and 1 subject from the 
PGL4001 10 mg group.  
Increases in E2 levels of clinical relevance were seen for a total of 7 subjects in the 5 mg/day group and 3 
subjects in the 10 mg group at Visit 7 (end of treatment course 2). There was no evidence that levels of E2 
decreased during the study; in general levels remained constant for most individuals during the study. 
Effect of ulipristal acetate on the pituitary-ovary axis during treatment in clinical studies 
The MAH provided additional data on endocrine parameters in order to evaluate the effect of ulipristal 
acetate on the pituitary-ovary axis during treatment in clinical studies. Endocrine parameters were 
measured at pre-defined time points during all clinical studies. Daily administration of ulipristal acetate 
partially suppressed FSH. Oestrogen levels (E2) tended to be in the mid-follicular range during treatment. 
Progesterone levels (P4) were reduced during treatment, and there was no effect on prolactin. 
In the two Phase II studies PGL-N-0287 and PGL-N-0090 in the target population, subjects were treated for 
3 months with 10 mg and 20 mg of ulipristal acetate. Measurement of prolactin, luteinising hormone (LH), 
FSH, E2 was performed approximately every 14 days. No effect on FSH or LH levels was observed. In 
addition, there was no indication of any ulipristal acetate mediated effects on prolactin and E2. 
In the Phase II Study PGL-H-510, healthy subjects were treated for 3 months with 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg 
of ulipristal acetate. Endocrine assessments showed no appreciable variation between groups at baseline 
and after 3 months of treatment. P4 was measured at lower values (< 3 ng/mL) during treatment in 82% or 
80% of subjects treated with ulipristal acetate 5 or 10 mg respectively compared to placebo (0%), indicating 
absence of ovulation. 
In short-term Phase III Study PGL07-021, median E2 levels were increased towards baseline in all groups 
(ulipristal acetate 5 mg, 10 mg and placebo) as the baseline value was taken during menstruation, when 
levels are at its lowest. Differences under treatment were observed due to placebo subjects continuing to 
experience normal menstrual cycles and most ulipristal acetate treated subjects being in anovulation. In all 
Assessment report

Page 58/74 
 
  
  
groups, however E2 concentrations remained at follicular phase levels. After the end of treatment with 
ulipristal acetate, median E2 values increased with ulipristal acetate, indicating that full ovarian function 
resumes promptly within a few weeks of treatment end. 
P4 levels were similar across treatment groups (ulipristal acetate 5 and 10 mg and placebo) at baseline and 
Week 5, but at Weeks 9 and 13 they were significantly lower with ulipristal acetate than with placebo. The 
majority of subjects in ulipristal acetate treatment groups had constantly low values whilst under treatment 
indicating absence of ovulation, although maximum values close to or above 5.0 ng/mL in all groups 
indicating a persistence of ovulation in some subjects. After treatment, at Week 17, the mean progesterone 
levels increased in the ulipristal acetate groups, suggesting resumption of ovulation. Results with ulipristal 
acetate in short-term Phase III studies PGL07-021 PGL07-022 were comparable. 
In the two long-term Phase III studies PGL09-026/027 and PGL11-006, no decrease of E2 levels compared 
to baseline was observed after repeated treatment courses. E2 levels were controlled and remained stable 
at a mid-follicular phase level. Levels obtained after 4 treatment courses did not differ from values obtained 
after one treatment course. 
Effects of Esmya on oestrogen levels and bone mineral density 
It is established that low oestradiol levels are associated with bone mineral density loss, and decreased 
oestradiol levels were identified as a major risk factor in the Framingham Study (Hannan et al., 2000). The 
association of anovulation and bone mineral density loss in women is on the contrary not established as 
anovulation is not mandatorily associated with low oestrogen levels. Typically patients with a polycystic 
ovarian symptom have anovulatory cycles but no decrease in bone mineral density as they maintain 
significant oestrogen levels (Kassanos et al., 2010). Thus oestrogen levels are essentially the determinant 
for bone mineral density loss and it is established that a level of oestradiol above 30 pg/mL is sufficient for 
maintaining adequate bone mineral density (Barbieri, 1998).  
The oestradiol levels recorded before, during treatment and after treatment in short-term and long-term 
studies with ulipristal acetate. In the short-term Phase III study PGL07-022, no impact on bone markers was 
observed following 3-month treatment with ulipristal acetate whereas a negative impact of the 
GnRH-agonist on bone markers was demonstrated (p<0.001; Study PGL07-022). With GnRH-agonist, 
oestradiol levels were reduced importantly and mean levels were below the postmenopausal threshold of 30 
pg/mL.  
As no effect was seen on urinary or serum bone markers after 3-month treatment with ulipristal acetate and 
owing to the fact that in absence of a comparator arm (either placebo or active comparator) in the long-term 
Phase III studies (PGL09-026/027 and PGL11-006) any change in bone marker measurements or bone 
mineral density would be difficult to interpret, the absence of impact on bone mineral density was assessed 
and confirmed in the above mentioned long-term trials by documenting the maintenance of serum oestradiol 
levels. Results are presented above. 
In addition, endometrium thickness is directly influenced by oestrogen levels and could therefore be 
considered as an indicator of premenopausal oestrogen levels. Endometrium thickness range is rather 
variable during a physiological ovulatory cycle in premenopausal women, but an endometrial thickness < 5 
mm indicates low oestradiol levels as seen in postmenopausal women (Breijer et al., 2012). 
Women treated with ulipristal acetate do not have a decreased endometrial thickness. In short-term Phase 
III studies, the percentage of subjects with an endometrial thickness < 4 mm remains in the range from 
8.7% to 19.3% which is comparable to screening and to the placebo control group (range 9.9%-20.0%). In 
long-term Phase III Studies PGL09-026/027 and PGL11-006, the repetition of treatment courses did not 
increase the percentage of patients with thin endometrium in comparison to pre-treatment or the placebo 
control group of Study PGL07-021

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Overall, 32 subjects, 16 in the PGL4001 5 mg group and 16 in the PGL4001 10 mg group, discontinued the 
study early due to safety reasons related to PGL4001. 
In general, the withdrawals due to TEAEs considered PGL4001-related were for a variety of reasons with few 
TEAEs occurring in more than one subject; 5 subjects withdrew due to SAEs considered related to PGL4001. 
Three subjects, one from the PGL4001 5 mg group and 2 from the PGL4001 10 mg group, were withdrawn 
due to the SAE of uterine leiomyoma, all considered PGL4001-related. These included one subject who 
experienced “partial expulsion of myoma” (PT: uterine leiomyoma), and 2 subjects who experienced a 
“myoma in status nascendi” (PT: uterine leiomyoma). One subject withdrew following treatment course 4 
due to the SAE of endometriosis, and one subject due to the SAE of bipolar disorder, both were considered 
PGL4001-related.  
PGL4001-related TEAEs leading to study withdrawal included 2 subjects who withdrew due to hypertension 
and 1 subject due to blood pressure increase. In addition, 3 reports of headache, 2 reports of nausea and 
dizziness, and single reports of anxiety, hypersensitivity, obesity, dyspnoea, abdominal 
discomfort/pain/distension, depression, diplopia, balance disorder, coordination abnormal, generalised 
rash, hyperhidrosis, urticaria, breast pain, menorrhagia, hot flush and malaise were reported as 
PGL4001-related TEAEs leading to subject withdrawal. 
In addition, 3 subjects requested to discontinue the study following AEs or changes to laboratory 
parameters. Subject 472/08 (PGL4001 5 mg group) had an SAE of menorrhagia that was considered 
PGL4001-related by the Investigator; she continued in the study but subsequently requested to withdraw 
due to ‘heavy bleeding during menses’. Two subjects requested to withdraw from the study with the reasons 
provided as ‘elevated liver enzymes’ and ‘elevated laboratory results’. 
Special population 
Pregnancies 
• 
During or after treatment in clinical studies 
During all clinical studies, subjects were requested to use a non-hormonal contraception and the objectives 
of clinical studies with ulipristal acetate in women with symptomatic uterine fibroids did not include fertility 
parameter assessment upon cessation of treatment. As 11 December 2014, in more than 1000 subjects 
treated in clinical studies with ulipristal acetate for fibroids, 8 pregnancies after treatment were reported 
(0.7%). No conception was reported under treatment with ulipristal acetate. 
Three cases of pregnancy post-treatment have been reported in short-term studies with fibroid subjects 
(PGL07-021 and PGL07-022), with conception time between 2-5 months after the last treatment dose. 
In the ongoing Phase III long-term clinical studies in the target population, 5 pregnancy reports have been 
received, one in Study PGL11-024 (drug exposure during pregnancy), with conception time during an 
off-treatment period few weeks before start of treatment course 1 and four other pregnancy reports were 
received from the ongoing Part II of Study PGL11-006. 
• 
During or after treatment in post-marketing 
Esmya post-marketing data contain some reports of pregnancy associated with ulipristal acetate treatment 
in women with symptomatic uterine fibroids. As of December 2014, an estimate of > 110,000 patients were 
treated with ulipristal acetate for fibroids. 60 pregnancy reports were received (47 with drug exposure 
before pregnancy i.e. conception occurred after treatment, 12 with drug exposure during pregnancy and one 
report with unspecified exposure timing). Not all outcomes are known at the time of writing.

In 11 out of 47 cases of drug exposure before pregnancy, the pregnancy ended with spontaneous, missed or 
induced abortion. In 3 out of 12 cases of drug exposure during pregnancy and in the pregnancy with drug 
exposure timing unspecified, the pregnancy ended with spontaneous, missed or induced abortion. 
The reported spontaneous abortion rates are not unexpected with regards to the target population. 
• 
After treatment in literature 
A search of the published literature dated 2nd December 2014 retrieved some pregnancy case reports after 
ulipristal acetate treatment in women with symptomatic uterine fibroids. 
One publication (Luyckx M et al, 2014) describes a first series of 18 pregnancies in 21 patients attempting 
to get pregnant after treatment with ulipristal acetate for symptomatic uterine fibroids. This was a 
retrospective analysis of patients included in studies PGL07-022 and PGL09-026 followed beyond the study 
end in one study centre. Overall, 15 patients succeeded (71 %) to get pregnant, totalling 18 pregnancies. 
The literature search also retrieved a case report (Monleon J et al, 2014) describing pre- treatment with 
ulipristal acetate 5 mg prior to pregnancy in a 37-year old woman (gravida 1, abortus 1), with a history of 
intramural uterine fibroids and prior myomectomy. A normal endometrial morphology cavity was observed 
following treatment with ulipristal acetate. Three months after the end of ulipristal acetate treatment, the 
patient was found to be 5 weeks pregnant. 
Also, of interest, another case report (Wdowiak A, 2013) was retrieved describing the case of a 35-year old 
patient with intramural uterine fibroids admitted for continued infertility treatment receiving a 3-month 
course of Esmya prior to intracytoplasmic sperm injection. The patient conceived, the pregnancy went to 
term and delivered following spontaneous labour a healthy baby (Wdowiak A, 2014). 
Post marketing experience 
The applicant estimates that approximately 60 500 women have been treated with Esmya as of 22 February 
2014, based on cumulative sales figures. Of those, 1,386 have been enrolled in the non-interventional 
PregLem-sponsored Post-Authorisation Safety Study (PASS) PREMYA (PGL10-014).  
The latest PSUR (EMEA/H/C/002041/PSUV/0025, covering the period 23 August 2013 to 22 February 2014) 
included these data. During the PSUR interval no new safety issues have been identified from clinical trials, 
post-marketing reports or literature. The identified and potential risks were considered adequately covered 
in the RMP and there was no need for an update of the product information. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The current variation application for Esmya is intended to extend the current, short-term pre-operative 
treatment to repeated intermittent treatment. In completed studies, 1,053 women have been exposed to 
ulipristal acetate for ≥3 months to the target dose of 5 mg/day or higher. Of these, 541 patients were 
exposed for ≥ two 3-month treatment courses and 457 subjects were exposed to four 3-month treatment 
courses, including results from the study PGL11-006 (Part I). In Part II of the ongoing Study PG11-006, 381 
subjects have completed 3 courses of treatment of whom 354 subjects have also completed a 4th course of 
treatment. Thus, the number of subjects exposed to ulipristal acetate for up to 6 months is large (above 
6000), whereas the numbers of subjects exposed ≥6 months and ≥12 months, respectively, are still not 
huge and just above the ICH E1 requirements for long-term exposure. 
The demographic characteristics were similar across the phase 3 studies, including the most recent study 
PGL11-006. The studies included mainly white females, aged just above 40 years, with a mean BMI slightly 
above 25 and the majority were of child-bearing potential. 
Assessment report  
EMA/341144/2015 
Page 61/74 
 
  
  
 
In Study PGL11-006 Part I, the most common TEAEs were headache, and hot flush. Other common TEAEs 
were influenza, breast pain/tenderness/discomfort, nausea, nasopharyngitis, fatigue and pelvic pain. The 
proportion of subjects reporting on-treatment TEAEs was higher during the first treatment course (44%) 
than during the second treatment course (<30%). A similar pattern was seen for treatment–related adverse 
events, i.e. a higher frequency reported during the first treatment course than during the second treatment 
course, and with hot flush and headache being most frequently reported. There were no obvious 
dose-related AEs. 
Off-treatment TEAEs (from >7 days after the last dose of a treatment course to the beginning of the next) 
were mainly related to uterine bleeding, e.g. dysmenorrhoea and menorrhagia. Fewer off-treatment TEAEs 
were reported following treatment course 2 than treatment course 1. 
Concerning adverse events of special interest (reproductive and breast disorders, excessive uterine 
bleeding, hot flushes and other castration-related symptoms, ovarian cysts, dysmenorrhea, headache and 
gastrointestinal disorders) the data from Study PGL11-006 are in line with previous results and do not give 
any cause for concern. 
The endometrial safety of ulipristal acetate, in particular endometrial thickness, hyperplasia/carcinoma and 
non-physiological changes, has been extensively discussed during the initial marketing authorisation 
procedure EMEA/H/C/2041, the variation EMEA/H/C/2041/II/19 extending the indication to two treatment 
courses and the present application . 
Due to the mechanism of action of ulipristal acetate, thickening of the endometrium is expected, as observed 
in previous short-term and long-term studies. The endometrial thickness has shown a similar pattern across 
studies, with about 5% showing an endometrial thickness >16 mm at screening and 7-15% of subjects 
showing a thickness >16 mm at 10-18 days after start of menses following treatment course 1. In study 
PGL11-006, the median endometrium thickness was similar to screening levels at all time-points during the 
study and post-treatment follow-up. There were fewer subjects with endometrium thickness >16 mm after 
successive treatment courses (4.9% and 3.5% of patients by the end of second and fourth treatment course, 
respectively). With regards to endometrial thickness, no significant differences were observed between the 
PGL4001 5 mg and 10 mg groups. 
Considering the available safety information, the applicant was requested to provide further advice in the 
SmPC for the prescriber on follow-up of patients during long-term treatment with Esmya and how to manage 
patients with increased endometrial thickness or with altered and/or unexpected bleeding patterns.  
Reversible increase in thickness of the endometrium may occur under treatment. In case of repeated 
intermittent treatment, periodic monitoring of the endometrium is recommended. This includes annual 
ultrasound to be performed after resumption of menstruation during off-treatment period. If endometrial 
thickening is noted, which persists after return of menstruations during off-treatment periods or beyond 
3 months following the end of treatment courses, investigation including endometrial biopsy should be 
performed in order to exclude other underlying conditions, including endometrial malignancy. Similarly, if 
during repeated intermittent treatment, after the initial reduction in bleeding or amenorrhoea, in case of an 
altered persistent or unexpected bleeding pattern, such as inter-menstrual bleeding, investigation of the 
endometrium including endometrial biopsy should be performed in order to exclude other underlying 
conditions, including endometrial malignancy (see SmPC section 4.4). 
Progesterone receptor modulator Associated Endometrial Changes (PAEC) describes the non-physiological 
histological changes in the endometrium that have been associated with treatment with progesterone 
receptor modulators. In all specimens of PAEC, there is an inactive, flattened and atrophic appearance of the 
epithelium. It is thinner than in the normal proliferative menstrual phase, and there is little evidence of 
mitosis. Repeated intermittent 3-month courses of ulipristal acetate in the 2 long term Phase III studies 
(PGL09-027 and PGL11-006) did not increase the occurrence of PAEC. From the study results there is no 
Assessment report  
EMA/341144/2015 
Page 62/74 
 
  
  
evidence that appearance of PAEC is a precursor to or a risk factor for more serious conditions of the 
endometrium such as hyperplasia with atypia or endometrial carcinoma. Repetition of treatment courses did 
not increase PAEC appearance, frequency or reversibility. Even after exposure to 8 treatment courses the 
detailed descriptions of PAEC features compare to those after a single treatment course. Overall, the data 
from this study confirmed a rapid reversibility of SPRM-associated non-physiological endometrial changes 
following completion of treatment and subsequent menstruation. 
With regards to hyperplasia, the MAH has provided an in depth discussion with respect to the characteristics 
of endometrial hyperplasia and mechanism of action of ulipristal acetate on the endometrium concluding 
that  its impact on the endometrium is specific and different from an unopposed oestrogen effect. In 
addition, in a previous procedure (EMEA/H/C/2041/II/14) including non-clinical carcinogenicity studies, the 
CHMP has previously concluded that UPA is not carcinogenic in experimental animals at sufficiently large 
exposure margins compared to human exposure. Thus, from a mechanistic point of view, it can be agreed 
that the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer may be lower compared to a continuous oestrogen 
effect. As in previous studies, endometrium biopsies were obtained at several time points in study 
PGL11-006. In total in long-term Phase III studies (PGL09-026/027 and PGL11-006), the applicant provided 
results from 380 biopsies taken 3 months after discontinuation of 4 treatment cycles with ulipristal acetate. 
With respect to the biopsy results in the clinical studies, the frequency of hyperplasia in all phase 3 studies 
was low (0.89%) and, importantly, lower than the incidence in study population prior to treatment (1.82%). 
When looking at the incidence after 4 courses in study 006, the incidence was 0.59% with 5 out of 6 cases 
being reversible. Preliminary results from the ongoing Pearl extension 2 (8 treatment courses) have not 
shown any cases of hyperplasia, albeit in a small sample size 
No particular pathologic pattern could be identified for the 6 cases of hyperplasia (e.g. progress from simple 
to complex atypical hyperplasia). In the 3 cases with atypical hyperplasia, one case resolved after having 
undergone curettage (at which the atypia had been diagnosed), one case spontaneously resolved while 
receiving ulipristal acetate treatment and one spontaneoulsy resolved within 3 months following treatment 
end. 
Overall, the available data on hyperplasia/malignant neoplasia during ulipristal acetate treatment in clinical 
trials indicate spontaneous reversibility of hyperplasia.  In addition, the incidence of hyperplasia did not 
increase during subsequent treatment courses. 
The incidence of hyperplasia in a healthy pre-menopausal population with no gynaecological symptoms is 
not well established. However, it is agreed with the applicant that the population with no gynaecological 
symptom is not the population of patients who will be treated by Esmya. Patients treated with UPA have 
fibroids with abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) and other gynaecological symptoms. The Applicant performed 
literature research where 13 publications were considered relevant for prevalence rate calculation. The 
prevalence of endometrial hyperplasia in the premenopausal population, reported in the literature, ranges 
from 2% to 25.3% with 0.03% to 1.26% for atypical hyperplasia. The incidence of hyperplasia in a study 
including 3006 women increases with age from 1.97% for women 30-40y to 4.68% in the age of 45-50 years 
(Iram, 2010). The majority of patients treated with UPA for fibroids-related AUB are likely to be > 40 years 
old. In study PGL11-006 the participants had a mean age around 42 years. In ulipristal acetate phase III 
studies the prevalence and incidence of endometrial hyperplasia rate were below 1% (0.59%, 95% CI 
0.07% to 2.12% over an 18 months period) and comparable with the published literature. Overall, repeated 
treatment with ulipristal acetate courses does not seem to increase the occurrence of more serious 
conditions of the endometrium such as hyperplasia with atypia or endometrial carcinoma. 
One important issue is that endometrial hyperplasia in most cases is asymptomatic and therefore may go 
undetected for quite some time. If hyperplasia persists, the condition will evolve and after an asymptomatic 
time interval becomes symptomatic and initiate further investigation (Archer, 1991). The actual risk of a 
one-time diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia will therefore to some part be depending on if the woman is 
Assessment report  
EMA/341144/2015 
Page 63/74 
 
  
  
asymptomatic or symptomatic, and characteristics of symptoms at the diagnosis. When a diagnosis of 
endometrial hyperplasia is established a spontaneous normalization or a subsequent diagnosis of 
adenocarcinoma (AC) is possible (Kurman, 1985; Lacey, 2008; Lacey, 2010). When there is no atypia, a 
quite long delay between the initial diagnosis of hyperplasia and a later diagnosis of AC is reported (11 years 
-4.1 years). Atypical hyperplasia may indeed develop to adenocarcinoma and a delay in diagnosis may result 
in a worsened prognosis. However, the incidence of atypial hyperplasia was very low and most likely not 
higher compared to what could be expected in the background population. 
In conclusion, the risk of endometrial hyperplasia associated with the use of UPA is considered as low. 
However there is limited information available on the long-term effect of Esmya after long-term use as long 
term treatment has been studied up to 4 intermittent treatment courses only. “Long-term effects of 
prolonged treatment of the endometrium (including possible malignant changes)” is included as a safety 
concern in the RMP under missing information (see RMP). Additional long term safety data, although mainly 
descriptive data, will be collected in the post-authorisation safety study (PGL14-001) following 1500 patients 
who intend a long-term treatment with UPA for up to 5 years. One of the limitations of PGL14-001 study is 
that there is no pre-defined number of biopsies because standard gynaecological practice does not 
recommend endometrial biopsies in asymptomatic patients. Further data on endometrial safety in the 
context of long-term use of ulipristal acetate will be also available from the ongoing  PGL11-024 (Pearl 
extension 2) which will provide endometrial biopsies after 8 repeated intermittent treatment courses with 10 
mg of ulipristal acetate (twice the marketed dose) (see RMP). 
An investigation of the observed cases of hyperplasia in Study PGL11-006 and an adequate description of 
follow-up was provided and showed that there was generally a good agreement between pathologists on the 
presence of hyperplasia, but some disagreement on the level of atypia. The need for further guidance for 
pathologists in diagnosing between benign/malignant endometrial biopsy taken during treatment with 
ulipristal acetate was discussed by the Applicant since even specialist pathologists had difficulties in 
interpretation of atypia findings.  
The discrepancy in diagnosing endometrial hyperplasia (with the current WHO classification which is 
recommended by FDA and was used for assessment in Phase III studies) is a well-described fact and not 
specific to the follow-up of treatment with ulipristal acetate. The applicant stated that EU pathologists have 
been and are extensively trained on PAEC. Since repetition of treatment courses does not lead to an increase 
in premalignant or malignant diagnoses or in any new features of the endometrium compared to short-term 
treatment, it is believed that no further training would allow minimising risk of discrepancies between 
pathologists. The SmPC already contains information about endometrial changes (see SmPC section 4.4) in 
particular that histological changes denoted as “Progesterone Receptor Modulator Associated Endometrial 
Changes” (PAEC) should not be mistaken for endometrial hyperplasia. As simple hyperplasia is the principal 
differential diagnosis to PAEC and simple and complex hyperplasia can occur spontaneously in women of 
reproductive age with abnormal bleeding and sometimes resolves, the applicant proposed to provide further 
guidance to the physician on how to proceed in case of any incidental hyperplasia diagnosis. Owing to the 
fact that compared to simple hyperplasia, only hyperplasia with nuclear atypia is at higher risk of 
progression to malignancy (Kurman et al. 1985), a different proceeding for atypical and non-atypical 
hyperplasia is recommended. In case of hyperplasia (without atypia), monitoring as per usual clinical 
practice (e.g. a follow-up control 3 months later) is recommended. In case of atypical hyperplasia, 
investigation and management as per usual clinical practice should be performed (see SmPC section 4.4). 
Information on the number of cases of hyperplasia observed in the clinical programme, its reversibility, the 
incidence, and comparison to prevalence in symptomatic menopausal women have been adequately 
reflected in the SmPC.  
Women who get symptomatic relief (less bloating & discomfort due to reduced fibroid size and better energy 
due to less heavy bleeding) might be inclined to use Esmya persistently without a break. This type of use 
Assessment report  
EMA/341144/2015 
Page 64/74 
 
  
  
poses a risk since intermittent use allows/induces a type of withdrawal bleed, which should offset any 
developing endometrial hyperplasia. In order to minimise the risk of occurrence of persistent use beyond 3 
months, stringent risk minimisation activities were and are undertaken. The proposed SmPC indicates at 
several occasions that the treatment should not be longer than 3 months continuously as the risk on 
endometrium is unknown if continued longer and that it must be intermittent in case of the proposed 
repeated intermittent use (see SmPC sections 4.2, 4.4). Educational material has been sent to all 
gynaecologists at time of national launches to increase awareness that each Esmya treatment course should 
be limited to 3 months. From the presented post marketing data the risk seems limited with a low number 
of cases and no detrimental reported adverse events.  
With regards to the effect of Esmya on short-term fertility and long-term fertility, it is noted that fertility is 
likely to be very low considering the target population’s age, fibroid condition and ulipristal acetate’s impact 
on the pituitary-ovary axis. In study PGL11-006 the participants had a mean age around 42 years. From the 
provided data on fertility from clinical studies and post-marketing data, the treatment with ulipristal acetate 
does not seem to have a negative impact on fertility either after short-term or repeated intermittent 
treatment. The need for contraception during treatment is already addressed in the SmPC (see SmPC 
section 4.4).  During the off-treatment interval ovulation resumes rapidly and consequently pregnancies 
may occur if no contraception is used. The Esmya SmPC already describes the pregnancy prevention prior 
treatment. In addition, a pregnancy test is indicated prior to treatment start in case of a suspected 
pregnancy (see SmPC section 4.4) 
The effects of Esmya on oestrogen levels and bone mineral density were discussed by the applicant. The 
majority of women treated with ulipristal acetate were anovulatory, though their E2 levels remained 
generally in physiological ranges after 3 months of treatment (Study PGL-H-510). Bone turnover was 
assessed by measurement of bone markers in Study PGL07-022, and by bone density scans in Study 
PGL-N-0090. The active control in study PGL07-022 was leuprorelin. The biochemical markers of bone 
resorption showed higher values with leuprorelin treatment compared to treatment with ulipristal acetate 
after 3 months. In study PGL-N-0090, there was no evidence of any change to bone density after 6 months 
of treatment with ulipristal acetate. It is likely that no adverse influence on bone mineral density is to be 
expected with repeated treatment courses. Other safety assessments including vital signs, physical 
examinations and laboratory assessments, as well as reported TEAEs and SAEs, both on- and off-treatment, 
showed that the intermittent repeated administration schedule was well tolerated, and the safety profile was 
comparable between the PGL4001 5 mg and 10 mg dosing groups. The number of TEAEs reported during 
treatment courses 2, 3 and 4 was lower than during treatment course 1, with no increase in frequency of any 
TEAE. The most frequently reported on-treatment TEAE was headache, and the most frequently reported 
on-treatment TEAE considered study medication-related was hot flush (mostly mild, none severe). The 
occurrence of hot flushes was in line with previous studies.  
The table of adverse drug reactions during treatment course 1 has been updated to reflect the revised 
frequencies of several adverse drug reactions based on the pooled data from the four phase III studies (see 
SmPC section 4.8). When comparing repeated treatment courses, overall adverse reactions rate was less 
frequent in subsequent treatment courses than during the first one and each adverse reaction was less 
frequent or remained in the same frequency category (except for dyspepsia which was classified as 
uncommon in treatment course 3 based on one patient occurrence). 
Overall, 34 SAEs occurred in 28 subjects, including 6 SAE reports of menorrhagia (5 were considered 
PGL4001- related). It is agreed that the occurrence of SAEs of menorrhagia could be expected as the 
population in the study are women with fibroid-related heavy menstrual bleeding.  Similar frequencies were 
reported in studies PGL07-021 and PGL07-022 in the screening phase and in control groups. Three SAEs of 
myoma expulsion were reported (PT: uterine leiomyoma), which are part of the possible evolution of the 
fibroid disease and may reflect a reduction in the size of the myoma. 
Assessment report  
EMA/341144/2015 
Page 65/74 
 
  
  
The analysis of TEAEs and provided SAEs did not raise any particular concerns regarding breast disorders 
during repeated intermittent treatment. The MAH has discussed the potential impact of ulipristal on the risk 
of breast cancer both with respect to selective progesterone receptor modulation as well as a result of a 
possible increase of estrogen levels. The current knowledge about Selective Progesterone Receptor 
Modulators (SPRM) does not indicate an increased risk for breast cancer. 
The discontinuations in study PGL11-006 give no cause for concern. Overall, across the phase 3 studies with 
ulipristal acetate (PGL07-021–Part A, PGL07-022 – Part A, PGL09-026, PGL09-027 and PGL11-006 Part I; 
1053 patients), TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation occurred at a rate of 2.0% (1.9% for the 5 mg 
dose and 2.1% for the 10 mg dose). 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Based on the available data related to endometrial safety after up to 4 treatment courses, no increased 
occurrence of more serious conditions of the endometrium such as hyperplasia with atypia or endometrial 
carcinoma was observed. The final study report from study PGL11-006 did not reveal any unexpected safety 
findings. It is reassuring that median endometrium thickness (7-8 mm) was similar to screening levels at 
all-time points during study and during the post-treatment follow-up. Furthermore, non-clinical 
carcinogenicity studies have become available after initial approval (see variation EMEA/H/C/2041/II/14). 
No neoplastic changes or other findings that would raise concern for long-term safety were observed in these 
studies. Thus, overall the safety profile is reassuring. 
Additional safety data will be collected in the post-authorisation safety study (PGL14-001) following 1500 
patients who intend a long-term treatment with UPA for up to 5 years as well as in the two already ongoing 
studies (PGL10-014 [already in the RMP], and PGL11-024). The currently ongoing study PGL11-024 (the 
second extension of PGL09-026, i.e. following PGL09-027) will provide safety and efficacy data of up to 8 
treatment courses, i.e. data on 4 additional treatment courses further to the data submitted in this variation 
(see RMP).

2.8.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. Some 
changes were also made in section 4.4, e.g. the warning with regard to endometrial changes. In addition, 
section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated with information from the new studies. The Package Leaflet has 
been updated accordingly. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
In short-term studies, i.e. one treatment course of 3 months, ulipristal acetate has shown a statistically 
significant difference in reduction in menstrual blood loss versus placebo and approximately 75% of the 
women were in amenorrhea after one treatment course with ulipristal acetate 5 mg/day. Patients treated 
with ulipristal acetate had a greater reduction in myoma size versus placebo. In comparison with the GnRH 
agonist leuprorelin, the effects of ulipristal acetate were overall of a similar magnitude. 
The clinical data after more than two treatment courses in study PGL11-006 has now been provided along 
with data from study PGL09-027 (previously assessed data). 
In study PGL11-006, 61.9% of patients on the 5 mg dose were in amenorrhea at the end of both treatment 
course 1 and 2; 48.7 % were in amenorrhea at the end of all four treatment courses. At the end of 
treatment course 4, 158 (69.6%) patients were assessed as being in amenorrhea. The proportion of 
subjects in amenorrhoea at the end of treatment course 4 was to some extent lower compared to at the 
end of course 2. However, the proportions are still considered to be of clinical relevance. In addition, 73.3 
% of the patients on the 5 mg dose had controlled bleeding (no episodes of heavy bleeding and a 
maximum of 8 days of bleeding over 56 days) after treatment course 4.  
The mean (median) PBAC scores associated with return of menstruation decreased after each subsequent 
treatment course. Both fibroid volume and uterine volume decreased during the study. The total volume of 
the 3 largest fibroids identified at screening was shown to decrease following the first treatment course, 
and to further decrease after each treatment course. The mean (median) percent change from baseline 
(screening 3) to visit 10 was -38% (-72%). By the end of treatment course 4, 81% had a ≥25% myoma 
volume reduction.  
An improvement in quality of life measurements evaluated using the specific UFS-QoL symptom severity 
and HRQL scales was also showed. During the off-treatment interval, with resumption of menstruation the 
quality of life was slightly reduced compared to the end of each treatment course, but was still improved 
in comparison to baseline. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Long term treatment has been studied up to 4 intermittent treatment courses (see SmPC section 4.2). 
Additional efficacy data will be available from the ongoing study PGL11-024 (the second extension of 
PGL09-026, i.e. following PGL09-027) will provide safety and efficacy data of up to 8 treatment courses, i.e. 
data on 4 additional treatment courses further to the available data (see RMP).

Repeated doses of ulipristal acetate is reported in 1238 subjects of whom 1053 were exposed for ≥3 months 
to the target dose of 5 mg/day or higher, and 541 subjects were exposed for ≥ two 3-month treatment 
courses to the target does of 5 mg/day or higher. Totally 457 subjects were exposed to four 3-month 
treatment courses in completed study with 5 or 10 mg/day (when taking account of off-treatment intervals, 
equates to 21 months of treatment and monitoring).  
Endometrial safety data are obtained from ultrasound examinations (endometrial thickness) and by biopsies 
(hyperplasia/carcinoma and non-physiological changes). The final study results of PGL11-006 were included 
with treatment courses 1 to 4 up to the end of the study follow-up visit, and with available data on women 
with endometrial thickness ≥ 16 mm. In long-term Phase III studies (PGL09-026/027 and PGL11-006), the 
total number of biopsies is 380, 3 months after discontinuation of 4 treatment courses. Excluding UPA+NETA 
subjects, the total number of adequate biopsies is 318, 3 months after discontinuation of 4 treatment 
courses. 
In study PGL11-006, there were fewer subjects with endometrium thickness >16 mm after successive 
treatment courses. The frequency decreased from 7.4% to 1.5% from treatment course 1 to treatment 
course 4. The median endometrium thickness was similar to screening levels at all time-points during the 
study and post-treatment follow-up.  
The frequency of non-physiological changes did not increase with repetition of treatment courses (observed 
in 17.8% and 13.3% of biopsies respectively following treatment courses 2 and 4). The data from this study 
confirmed a rapid reversibility of SPRM-associated non-physiological endometrial changes following 
completion of treatment and subsequent menstruation. 
With respect to the biopsy results in the clinical studies, the frequency of hyperplasia in all phase 3 studies is 
low (0.89%) and, importantly, lower than the incidence in study population prior to treatment (1.82%). 
When looking at the incidence after 4 courses in study 006, the incidence was 0.59% with 5 out of 6 cases 
being reversible. Preliminary results from the ongoing Pearl extension 2 (8 treatment courses) have not 
shown any cases of hyperplasia, albeit in a small sample size. In addition, from a mechanistic point of view, 
it can be agreed that the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer may be lower compared to a continuous 
oestrogen effect. Therefore, the risk of endometrial hyperplasia associated with the use of ulipristal acetate 
is considered as low and does not preclude an approval of repeated, intermittent treatment courses. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects  
Long term safety has been studied up to 4 intermittent treatment courses (see SmPC section 4.2). 
Long-term safety data with particular attention to endometrial safety will be followed in three studies 
(PGL10-014, PGL11-024 and PGL14-001, see RMP). 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Studies evaluating treatment up to 4 intermittent treatment courses studies have shown that ulipristal 
acetate treatment results in amenorrhoea in a substantial part of the women. Available data have shown 
that the effects are maintained over up to four treatment courses where approximately 73 % of women 
experienced controlled bleeding. Reductions in myoma and uterine volume are observed and clinically 
relevant effects on pain and quality of life outcomes are also shown. Thus, it is considered sufficiently 
demonstrated that the effect of Esmya is maintained during repeated intermittent use which is assessed as 
important. 
The adverse event profile is rather benign and data up to 4 intermittent treatment cycles have not shown 
any new or unexpected adverse events.  
Assessment report  
EMA/341144/2015 
Page 72/74 
 
  
  
The incidence and prevalence of hyperplasia with ulipristal acetate are below 1% and compares with 
published literature regarding prevalence. Repeated treatment with ulipristal acetate courses did not 
increase the occurrence of more serious conditions of the endometrium such as hyperplasia with atypia or 
endometrial carcinoma. The action of ulipristal acetate on the endometrium is specific and different from an 
unopposed oestrogen effect. Ulipristal acetate is not carcinogenic in experimental animals at sufficiently large 
exposure margins compared to human exposure. The risk of endometrial hyperplasia associated with the use 
of ulipristal acetate is considered as low and does not preclude an approval of repeated, intermittent treatment 
courses.  
Benefit-risk balance 
The Benefit/Risk for the proposed extension of indication for Esmya for intermittent treatment of moderate 
to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids in adult women of reproductive age is considered positive. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Esmya is currently approved for the pre-operative treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of uterine 
fibroids in adult women of reproductive age with a treatment duration limited to a maximum of two 
treatment courses of 3 months each. The limitation in duration of treatment was due to lack of long term 
safety data. Surgery may not be a suitable option for all patients, e.g. for medical or personal reasons or if 
the woman is peri-menopausal and would rather wait that the symptoms of uterine fibroids decrease as 
result of menopause. Thus, a continued medical treatment of fibroids would be valuable and currently no 
medical treatment is approved in this indication. 
Safety and efficacy data on the use of Esmya for intermittent treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of 
uterine fibroids in adult women of reproductive age is available for up to 4 intermittent treatment courses. 
Further long-term safety and efficacy data will be available from several studies as reflected in the risk 
management plan. 
Women who get symptomatic relief (less bloating & discomfort due to reduced fibroid size and better energy 
due to less heavy bleeding) might be inclined to use Esmya persistently without a break. This type of use 
poses a risk since intermittent use allows/induces a type of withdrawal bleed, which should offset any 
developing endometrial hyperplasia. In order to minimise the risk of occurrence of persistent use beyond 3 
months, stringent risk minimisation activities were initiated at the time of initial MA and are still undertaken. 
The treatment should not be longer than 3 months continuously as the risk on endometrium is unknown if 
continued longer and that it must be intermittent in case of the proposed repeated intermittent use (see 
SmPC sections 4.2, 4.4). Educational material is in place to increase awareness that each Esmya treatment 
course should be limited to 3 months. From the presented post marketing data the risk seems limited with 
a low number of cases and no detrimental reported adverse events.  
The  discrepancy  in  diagnosing  endometrial  hyperplasia  is  a  well-described  fact  and  not  specific  to  the 
follow-up of treatment with ulipristal acetate. The educational material to prescribers and pathologists has been 
updated  to  reflect  the  extended  indication.  The  educational  program  in  combination  with  the  additional 
pharmacovigilance activities in the RMP are considered sufficient and will provide appropriate measures on 
reducing the risk of inappropriate management of endometrium thickening and inappropriate diagnosis of 
endometrial hyperplasia as well as long term treatment with ulipristal acetate.

5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 8 
"steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
Scope 
Extension of the indication to include intermittent treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of uterine 
fibroids in adult women of reproductive age; consequently, the sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the 
SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Furthermore, the key 
elements of the educational material in Annex II have been revised. 
Summary 
This variation extends the use of Esmya to include intermittent treatment of moderate to severe symptoms 
of uterine fibroids based on data from two phase III studies. In that context, safety information has also 
been updated with recommendations for periodic monitoring of the endometrium and information on the 
management of altered bleeding (inter-menstrual bleeding) and hyperplasia (with and without atypia).

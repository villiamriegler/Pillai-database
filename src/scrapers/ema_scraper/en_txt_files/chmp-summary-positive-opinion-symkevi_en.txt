Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Symkevi 
tezacaftor / ivacaftor 
On 26 July 2018, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Symkevi, 
intended for the combination treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 12 years and older. 
Symkevi was designated as an orphan medicinal product on 27 February 2017. The applicant for this 
medicinal product is Vertex Pharmaceuticals (Europe) Ltd. 
Symkevi will be available as film-coated tablets containing 100 mg tezacaftor and 150 mg ivacaftor (ATC 
code: R07AX31). Symkevi is to be used in patients with F508del mutations affecting the CF 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which encodes for the CFTR protein. Tezacaftor 
facilitates the cellular processing and trafficking of the CFTR protein to the cell membrane, while ivacaftor 
improves CFTR protein function by increasing CFTR channel gating.  
The benefits with Symkevi are its ability to improve pulmonary function and decrease the number and 
rate of pulmonary exacerbations in CF patients, measured over 24 weeks and 8 weeks in two pivotal 
studies. The most commonly observed adverse reactions are headache and nasopharyngitis. 
The full indication is:  
"Symkevi is indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor 150 mg tablets for the treatment of 
patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 12 years and older who are homozygous for the F508del 
mutation or who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation and have one of the following 
mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene: P67L, R117C, 
L206W, R352Q, A455E, D579G, 711+3A→G, S945L, S977F, R1070W, D1152H, 2789+5G→A, 
3272-26A→G, and 3849+10kbC→T".  
It is proposed that Symkevi be prescribed by physicians with experience in the treatment of CF. If the 
patient’s genotype is unknown, an accurate and validated genotyping method should be performed to 
confirm the presence of an indicated mutation using a genotyping assay. As part of the combination 
regimen, Symkevi is to be taken in the morning and ivacaftor alone in the evening. 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product

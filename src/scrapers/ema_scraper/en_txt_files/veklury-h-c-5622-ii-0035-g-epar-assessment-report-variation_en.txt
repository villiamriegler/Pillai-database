2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
As of 17 February 2022, approximately 12.5 million children aged 0 to 17 years in the US had tested 
positive for COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic {American Academy of Pediatrics 2022}. 
Although children with COVID-19 frequently have mild or moderate symptoms {Gotzinger 2020, 
Liguoro 2020, Zimmermann 2020}, COVID-19 can result in severe disease. 
Although the minority of children display severe COVID-19, reports of hospitalized paediatric patients 
from neonates to adolescents are increasing. In those with severe disease, symptoms and radiological 
findings are similar to those of adults. Furthermore, underlying conditions such as pulmonary disease, 
immunocompromised state, or coexisting respiratory infections might predispose to severe respiratory 
disease.  
While vaccination against COVID-19 infection is effective in preventing COVID-19, vaccines are not yet 
available for all children and breakthrough cases of COVID-19 can occur in those who are vaccinated. 
Thus, a treatment for pediatric patients with COVID-19 is needed. 
Disease or condition 
A novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first 
identified in December of 2019 in Wuhan, China as causing a respiratory illness designated as 
coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19. On 30 January 2020, the International Health Regulations 
Emergency Committee of the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of 
International Concern {World Health Organization (WHO) 2020, https://www.who.int/news-
room/detail/27-04-2020-who-timeline---covid-19} Since then, there has been rapid spread of the 
virus, leading to a global pandemic of COVID-19.  
The human disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been designated COVID-19. In most (~80%) cases, 
COVID-19 presents as a mild-to-moderately severe, self-limited acute respiratory illness with fever, 
cough, and shortness of breath. Symptoms are thought to appear 2 to 14 days after exposure. COVID-
19 can be severe, resulting in pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, hypercoagulation, 
kidney failure, and death. 
The vulnerability of children to infection with SARS-CoV-2 is expected to be equivalent to that of 
adults; however, similar to SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 
infection appears to be less common in children {Cruz 2020, Dong 2020, Lee 2020, Zimmermann 
2020}. With moderate to severe COVID-19, both populations display similar symptoms. Although 
COVID-19 infections usually lead to mild or moderate symptoms in children, some progress to severe 
disease and require hospitalization (49.7 per 100,000 cases at Coronavirus Disease 2019 Associated 
Hospitalization Surveillance Network sites in the US from 01 March 2020 to 14 August 2021 and 0.1%-
0.2% in Europe from 04 January to 20 June 2021) {Delahoy 2021, European Centre for Disease 
Prevention and Control 2021}. Although the minority of children display severe COVID-19, reports of 
hospitalized paediatric patients from neonates to adolescents are increasing. In those with severe 
disease, symptoms and radiological findings are similar to those of adults. Furthermore, underlying 
conditions such as pulmonary disease, immunocompromised state, or coexisting respiratory infections 
Assessment report on group of variations including an extension of indication 
assessment report  
EMA/789715/2022  
Page 8/105 
 
 
 
might predispose to severe respiratory disease. A statistically higher chance of severe lower 
respiratory tract disease has been noted in children infected with human CoVs and underlying 
pulmonary disorders, an immunocompromised state, and coinfection with a respiratory copathogen(s). 
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
The following therapeutic indication is proposed: 
Veklury is indicated for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): 
• 
• 
adults and paediatric patients adolescents (aged at least 4 weeks of age 12 to less than 18 
years and weighing at least 40 kg) with pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen (low- or 
high-flow oxygen or other non -invasive ventilation at start of treatment).  
adults and paediatric patients (weighing at least 40 kg) who do not require supplemental 
oxygen and who are at increased risk of progressing to severe COVID -19. 
(see section 5.1) 
The extension of the current indication pertains to the following: 
• 
treatment of paediatric patients (at least 4 weeks of age and weighing at least 3 kg) with 
pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen (low- or high-flow oxygen) or other non-invasive 
ventilation at start of treatment. 
•  treatment of paediatric patients (weighing at least 40 kg) who do not require supplemental 
oxygen and who are at increased risk of progressing to severe COVID 19. 
Epidemiology and risk factors 
On 12 January 2020 it was announced that a novel coronavirus had been identified in samples 
obtained from cases and that initial analysis of virus genetic sequences suggested that this was the 
cause of the outbreak. This virus is referred to as SARS-CoV-2, and the associated disease as COVID-
19. On 30 January 2020, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the WHO 
declared the COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern {World Health 
Organization (WHO (https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/27-04-2020-who-timeline---covid-19) 
2020c}. Globally, as of 7 September 2022, there have been 603,711,760 confirmed cases of COVID-
19, including 6,484,136 deaths, reported to WHO. In Europe, 249,105,808 case were confirmed 
{World Health Organization (WHO) 2022}. 
Recently, the world has experienced a switch from a predominant delta variant pandemic to an 
omicron variant pandemic. Globally, from 5 August to 5 September 2022, 118,028 SARS-CoV-2 
sequences were shared through GISAID. Among these, 117,317 sequences were the Omicron variant of 
concern (VOC), accounting for 99.4% of sequences reported globally in the past 30 days. A comparison of 
sequences submitted to GISAID in epidemiological week 34 (22 to 28 August 2022) and week 33 (15 to 
21 August 2022) shows that BA.5 Omicron descendent lineages continue to be dominant globally, with 
an increase in weekly prevalence from 84.8% to 86.8%. The prevalence of BA.4 descendent lineages 
decreased from 6.8% in week 33 to 4.2% in week 34 including BA.4.6 descendent lineage, which 
decreased from 3.5% to 2% within the same time period. The prevalence of BA.2 descendent lineages 
(BA.2.X) remained stable in week 34 compared to week 33 (2.6% in week 33 and 2.5% in week 34). 
BA.2.75, an Omicron descendent lineage under monitoring, still shows a relatively low (0.9% and 1.2% in 
weeks 33 and 34 respectively) prevalence globally, but a number of countries have observed recent 
increasing trends {taken from World Health Organization (WHO) 2022}.

Most infections are self-limiting. However, approximately 15% of adults with COVID-19 develop severe 
pneumonia that requires treatment with supplemental oxygen, and an additional 5% of adults with 
COVID-19 progress to critical illness, with hypoxemic respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress 
syndrome, and multiorgan failure, potentially requiring ventilator oxygen support for several weeks 
{Chen 2020a, Wu 2020, Zhou 2020}. 
The cumulative incidence of COVID-19-associated hospitalizations in children and adolescents aged 0 
to 17 years from 01 March 2020 to 14 August 2021 was 49.7 per 100,000 at Coronavirus Disease 
2019-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network sites in the US {Delahoy 2021}. Among 3,116 
hospitalized children and adolescents with COVID-19 from 01 March 2020 to 19 June 2021, 26.5% 
(827 patients) were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), 6.1% (190 patients) required invasive 
mechanical ventilation, and 0.7% (21 patients) died. In Europe, children made up an increasing 
proportion of weekly reports of cases of COVID-19 infection during the period from 04 January to 20 
June 2021, coinciding with the availability of vaccines for adults, although the percentage of children 
across different age groups from 1 to 18 years who were admitted to hospital remained low (0.1%-
0.2%) {European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control 2021}. In those with severe disease, 
symptoms and radiological findings are similar to those of adults. Furthermore, as said underlying 
conditions such as pulmonary disease, immunocompromised state, or coexisting respiratory infections 
might predispose children to severe respiratory disease {Ogimi 2019}. Risk factors identified in 
children with COVID-19 infection for hospitalization and/or ICU admission include complex chronic 
diseases, type 1 diabetes, obesity, and cardiac and circulatory congenital anomalies {Kompaniyets 
2021}. Prematurity has been identified as a risk factor for severe disease in children under 2 years old.  
Biologic feature, Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Coronaviruses are a group of highly diverse, enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded ribonucleic 
acid (RNA) viruses that belong to two subfamilies, Coronaviridae and Toroviridae, in the family of 
Coronaviridae. These viruses were first discovered in the 1960s and can be further classified into four 
main genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus, based on 
their phylogenetic relationships and genomic structures. The severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) 
beta coronavirus causing coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Phylogenetic analysis of the complete 
viral genome revealed that the virus, SARS-CoV-2, is part of the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus 
Betacoronavirus and is most closely related (approximately 88% identity) to a group of SARS CoV-like 
coronaviruses previously sampled from bats in China. Currently, there are seven strains of 
coronaviruses that are known to infect humans, including the recently identified SARS-CoV-2, human 
coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), OC43 (HCoV-OC43), NL63 (HCoV-NL63), HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus (MERS-CoV). 
The virus causes respiratory illness in people and can spread from person to person {Center for 
Disease Control (CDC) 2020, Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2020}. While most 
people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have mild upper respiratory tract disease, older individuals and 
adults with comorbidities are more likely to have severe progressive pneumonia and multiorgan failure. 
Accumulating evidence has suggested that inflammatory responses play a critical role in the 
progression of COVID-19, and several markers have some tracing and detecting accuracy for disease 
severity (Mehta et al., 2020, Stebbing et al., 2020, Wu C. et al., 2020). Immune-mediated lung injury 
Assessment report on group of variations including an extension of indication 
assessment report  
EMA/789715/2022  
Page 10/105 
 
 
 
 
 
and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are associated with adverse outcomes in patients with 
COVID-19. 
The natural course of COVID-19 is classified into 3-stage, recognizing that COVID-19 illness exhibits 3 
grades of increasing severity, which correspond with distinct clinical findings, response to therapy, and 
clinical outcome. Stage 1 is the early infection stage, with mild symptoms and high viral load. The 
second stage is characterised by pulmonary involvement with or without hypoxia, established 
pulmonary disease, viral multiplication and localized inflammation in the lung. A minority of COVID-19 
patients will transition into the third and most severe stage of the illness, which manifests as an 
extrapulmonary systemic hyperinflammation syndrome and systemic hyperinflammation. 
The efficacy of antiviral agents may vary depending on whether a patient presents early or late in the 
course of COVID-19 (i.e., during viral pathogenesis versus after immunopathologic manifestations) 
{Harrington 2020}. Although research into COVID-19 continues to evolve, it is expected that the 
impact of antiviral agents such as RDV is likely to be greatest early in the course of COVID-19 (i.e., 
prior to the need for advanced respiratory support).  
Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
Common signs of infection include fever, cough, shortness of breath, breathing difficulties, and other 
respiratory symptoms. In severe cases, SARS-CoV-2 can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory 
syndrome, kidney failure, and death {World Health Organization (WHO) 2020a}.Therefore, while most 
people with COVID-19 develop only mild or moderate disease, approximately 15% develop severe 
disease that requires oxygen support, and 5% have critical disease with complications such as 
respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, 
thromboembolism, and/or multiorgan failure, including acute kidney injury and cardiac injury. 
Older age, and underlying non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiac 
disease, chronic lung disease and cancer, have been reported as risk factors for severe disease and 
death. 
COVID-19 has been also associated with mental and neurological manifestations, including delirium or 
encephalopathy, agitation, stroke, meningoencephalitis, impaired sense of smell or taste, etc. 
Regarding pregnant women, some studies have suggested that women with SARS CoV-2 infection 
during pregnancy are at increased risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes like preterm birth 
or pre-eclampsia.  {Ipek Gurol-Urganci eat al 2021}  
Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are generally milder in children compared with adults. Although 
COVID-19 infections usually lead to mild or moderate symptoms in children, some progress to severe 
disease and require hospitalization. In those with severe disease, symptoms and radiological findings 
are similar to those of adults. Most recently, an acute presentation with a hyperinflammatory 
syndrome leading to multiorgan failure and shock has been described named as multisystem 
inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19 in children and adolescents.  
The diagnosis of COVID-19 can be established based on a suggestive clinical history and the detection 
of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory secretions. Nucleic acid tests that detect the SARS-CoV-2 RNA 
genome are now widely employed to diagnose coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In addition, 
serological assays measure antibody responses and determine seroconversion although they are not 
well suited to detect acute infections.

Management 
In the EU currently two vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection are approved for paediatric patients. 
Comirnaty for children aged five years and older and Spikevax for children aged six years and older. 
Dexamethasone can be used in the EU to treat COVID-19 in adolescents aged 12 years and older and 
weighing at least 40 kg after EMA's CHMP completed its review under Article 5(3). Treatment with 
Dexamethasone have been proven effective and safe in the treatment of severe COVID-19 of severe 
COVID-19 in adolescents aged 12 years and older and weighing at least 40 kg and require 
supplemental oxygen. Furthermore, Remdesivir is approved for the treatment of COVID-19 in 
adolescent patients with pneumonia aged 12 years and older and weighing at least 40 kg who require 
low-flow oxygen, high-flow oxygen or non-invasive mechanical ventilation at the start of therapy. 
Currently, several monoclonal antibodies are approved for the treatment of mild and moderate COVID-
19 infection in adolescent patients outside the hospital setting, Xevudy (sotrovimab) and Ronapreve 
(casirivimab/imdevimab) and Evusheld (tixagevimab/cilgavimab). Xevudy and Ronapreve are indicated 
for treating COVID-19 in adults and adolescents (from 12 years of age and weighing at least 40 
kilograms) who do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk of their disease 
becoming severe. Ronapreve can also be used for preventing COVID-19 in people aged 12 years and 
older weighing at least 40 kilograms. Evushed was also approved for preventing COVID-19 in people 
aged 12 years and older weighing at least 40 kilograms.  
Currently, there are no approved antiviral treatments for the treatment of COVID-19 in children and 
adolescents below the age of 12 or weighing less than 40 kg. 
In addition, paediatric patients with COVID-19 are treated with relevant supportive care, including 
e.g., oxygen, mechanical ventilation and other life support, as required. 
There is a high medical need for an effective agent for treatment of COVID-19 for children and 
adolescents especially for those below 12 years of age or weighing less than 40 kg. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Veklury received a ‘conditional marketing authorisation’ in the EU on 3 July 2020 and was initially 
indicated for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with 
pneumonia who require supplemental oxygen.  
On 21 December 2020, the CHMP concluded that the benefit/risk has not been shown to be positive in 
patients on IMV or ECMO and restricted the indication of remdesivir accordingly (please refer to 
procedure EMEA/H/C/005622/II/0012). Veklury® is now indicated for the treatment of coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adults and adolescents (aged 12 years and older with body weight at least 
40 kg) with pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen (low- or high-flow oxygen or other non-invasive 
ventilation at start of treatment). 
On 16 December 2021, the CHMP adopted a positive opinion recommending the use of remdesivir in 
adult patients with COVID-19 who do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk 
for progressing to severe disease (please refer to procedure EMEA/H/C/005622/II/0016). Veklury® is 
now also indicated for the treatment of COVID-19 in adult patients who do not require supplemental 
oxygen and who are at increased risk of progressing to severe COVID 19. 
Remdesivir is a nucleotide prodrug that is intracellularly metabolized into an analogue of adenosine 
triphosphate that inhibits viral RNA polymerases. Remdesivir competes with the natural ATP substrate 
for incorporation into nascent RNA chains by the SARS-CoV 2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which 
Assessment report on group of variations including an extension of indication 
assessment report

Page 12/105 
 
 
 
results in delayed chain termination during replication of the viral RNA. Remdesivir triphosphate can 
also inhibit viral RNA synthesis following its incorporation into the template viral RNA by compromising 
the efficiency of incorporation of the complementary natural nucleotide. Remdesivir has broad-
spectrum activity against members of the coronaviruses (CoVs; eg, severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus-2 [SARS-CoV-2], SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]-CoV), filoviruses 
(e.g., Ebola virus, Marburg virus), and paramyxoviruses (e.g., respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], Nipah 
virus, Hendra virus).  
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
No CHMP scientific advice was given on the Remdesivir development programme. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The MAH has provided statements that clinical trials were conducted in accordance with GCP. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The MAH provided an updated ERA regarding the PECsurfacewater values for remedesivir and for GS 
441524, the environmentally relevant active substance. Remdesivir is a prodrug of the nucleoside 
analog GS-441524. 
PECsurfacewater values have been refined by modifying the Fpen using estimated potential patient 
population and the fixed treatment regime of the product. 
GS 441524:   Doseai = 96.7 mg/d, Fpen = 0.0000425 
PECsurfacewater-refined = 0.00205 [µg/L] 
Remdesivir: 
Doseai = 200 mg/d, Fpen = 0.0000425 
PECsurfacewater-refined = 0.00425 [µg/L] 
The PECsurface water value for GS 441524 or remdesivir is below the trigger value of 0.01 μg·L-1 and 
therefore a Phase II assessment is not required.   
GS-441524 has a logKow < 4.5 and therefore a PBT assessment is not necessary.

2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of Remdesivir.  
Considering the above data, Remdesivir is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. Remdesivir 
should be used according to the precautions stated in the SmPC in order to minimize any potential 
risks to the environment.

Study GS GS-US-540-5823:  Uncontrolled clinical study pertinent to the claimed indication. 
Study GS-US-540-5823 is a phase 2/3, single-arm, open-label, multicentre study to evaluate the 
safety, tolerability, PK, and efficacy of RDV in paediatric participants from birth to < 18 years with 
COVID-19 Phase 2/3, single-arm, open-label, multicentre study. 
Study GS-US-540-9012: Randomized, placebo-controlled study pertinent to the claimed indication. 
Study GS-US-540-9012 is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study 
to evaluate treatment with IV RDV in an outpatient setting in participants with confirmed COVID-19 
who were at risk for disease progression. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
New pharmacokinetic studies were submitted.  
New pharmacokinetic studies were submitted.  
Study GS-US-540-5823 
PK was evaluated in study GS-US-540-5823. Only design features concerning the PK-outcome are 
presented here. For further information on the study design, please refer to the clinical efficacy and 
safety section. 
Statistical analysis of pharmacokinetics 
The primary end point was the PK of RDV and its metabolites (GS-441524 and GS-704277). By-
participant concentration data listings that included PK concentrations and PK sampling details 
(procedures, differences in scheduled and actual draw times, and sample age) were provided for all 
enrolled participants. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters from population PK modelling of RDV and metabolites were listed and 
summarized using descriptive statistics. Summary statistics (numbers of participants, mean, SD, 
percentage coefficient of variation [%CV], median, minimum, maximum, Q1, and Q3) were presented 
by cohort and overall.

Plasma concentrations of SBECD were also analysed (where possible) as a secondary end point. 
However, these data have not been submitted yet. 
Sample size and power, Cohorts 1 through 4 and Cohort 8 
Twelve participants for each cohort in Cohorts 1 through 4 were planned for enrolment in this study. 
The PK data from 12 participants from each cohort in Cohorts 1 through 4 provided greater than 99% 
power for each cohort to conclude exposure equivalence of RDV AUCtau in adolescents and children in 
this study compared with 25 healthy adult participants from Study GS-US-399-5505. Two 1-sided tests 
were used, each performed at an alpha level of 0.05. 
It was assumed that the geometric mean ratio of AUCtau between the adolescents and children versus 
the adult group was equal to 1, the inter-subject SD (natural log scale) of RDV AUCtau was 0.18 
ng•h/mL, and the equivalency boundary was 70% to 143%. The PK data from 12 participants from 
each cohort in Cohorts 1 through 4 also provided greater than 99% power for each cohort to conclude 
exposure equivalence of RDV Cmax in adolescents and children in this study compared with 26 healthy 
adult participants from Study GS-US-399-5505, assuming the expected geometric mean ratio of Cmax 
between the adolescents and children group and the adult group was equal to 1, the intersubject SD 
(natural log scale) of Cmax was 0.19 ng•h/mL, and the equivalency boundary was 70% to 143%. 
Plasma PK parameters by dose for RDV and its metabolites following 30-minute IV infusion in adult 
participants from Study GS-US-399-5505 is provided in the Table 1-2 of the SAP (Appendix 16.1.9). 
Sample size and power calculations were made using the software package nQuery Advisor® Version 
8.5 (Cork, Ireland).

No new information was submitted. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
New pharmacodynamics studies were submitted. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
New popPK modelling data were submitted. 
The previous popPK model describing PK data of RDV and its metabolites in adults was based on three 
phase 1 studies. This model is now updated and refined with data derived from one paediatric phase 3 
study (-5823) and the two studies (9012 and -5844/REMDACTA/WA42511). 
Model Development 
The popPK analysis dataset included RDV, GS-704277, and GS-441524 concentrations. A total of 
14588 PK samples were available (4875 for RDV, 4846 for GS-704277, and 4867 for GS-441524) from 
611 subjects. Of the total 14588 PK samples, 654 were paediatric samples, and 13934 were adult PK 
samples of which 4103 were samples from COVID-19 patients and 9831 were samples from healthy 
volunteers. 
The development of the popPK model for RDV and its metabolites was performed sequentially, starting 
with the parent RDV data, then moving onto GS-704277 data, and ending with GS-441524 data. Aside 
from the parent model, each model was informed by the post hoc popPK parameters from the previous 
model or models. Plasma concentration-time data were analysed using a NONMEM approach (NONMEM

assessment report

software, version 7.4.3). The first-order conditional estimation method of NONMEM with interaction 
method was used for PK model development. 
The previous final popPK models, were used as a starting point to develop the models for RDV, GS-
704277, and GS-441524, as applicable. However, the previous final model did not adequately describe 
the newly added data from studies GS-US-540-5823, GS-US-540-9012 and WA42511 (REMDACTA). 
Therefore, a further modelling development was implemented. The parameters were re-estimated 
using all data available from Studies GS-US-399-1812, GS-US-399-1954, GS US-399 5505, GS-US 
540-5823, GS-US-540-9012, and REMDACTA (WA42511) for evaluation.

To determine the full covariate model, each covariate that was identified as a significant covariate 
during the screening was added to the base model using a stepwise forward addition method. First, 
each covariate was added to the base model one at a time. All significant covariates at P < 0.01 with 
difference in objective function value (OFV) > 6.64 were retained. The most significant covariate was 
retained in the model, and the forward addition was repeated with the remaining significant covariates. 
Finally, all significant covariates were included to form a full popPK model. The error models for IIV 
and RV in the full multivariable model were evaluated following completion of forward selection. This 
evaluation included the addition of new IIV terms to other parameters in the model, reevaluation of 
the appropriateness of the functional form for each IIV term and the RV model, and assessment of 
possible correlations between eta (η) variables. The backward step started with the full popPK model. 
Each covariate was removed one at a time, and the least significant covariate that did not reach the P

< 0.001 level of significance (> 10.83) was dropped from the model. This process was repeated until 
all remaining covariates were significant when removed one at a time.

Table 3: Covariates in the paediatric data to be evaluated 
Allometric scaling was chosen as superior to modelled weight exponents. In the previously developed 
model for HV, CL- and Q-related weight exponents were fixed to 0.75, and V-related weight exponents 
were fixed to 1.0. Modelled weight exponents were explored in subjects aged ≥ 6 years for the RDV 
base model and compared to the allometric scaling mentioned. The sparsity of data in subjects aged < 
6 years and the potential impact of maturation may have obscured the impact of modelled weight 
exponents and was not considered for initial tests.  
A maturation function was incorporated for the CL of RDV and GS-704277. Unlike RDV and GS-
704277, GS-441524 follows a glomerular filtration. Baseline creatinine clearance (BCRCL) is considered 
a marker for glomerular filtration. Given that BCRCL was not identified as an impactful covariate, a 
maturation function was not considered for GS-441524. Various maturation functions identified in the 
literature were considered, and the selected final form, which adequately recreates the maturation 
process is as follows:

scaling and modelled weight exponents. In both cases, the impact of adding a maturation function was 
minor in terms of OFV (< 1.5 difference in both cases) and parameter estimates. Additionally, even 
with the inclusion of a maturation function, the allometric weight scaling was deemed preferable given 
the small difference on OFV, the instability caused by the added parameters, and the unrealistic 
estimates for modelled weight exponents. Moreover, to further improve the fit on younger subjects, 
the estimation of 
50 was evaluated. However, given the sparsity of data in the youngest age 
groups compared to adults, 
50 was estimated to approach 0. Given the small penalty on OFV (< 3 
points), 
50 was fixed to 0.542.

𝐴𝐴GE
A significant fraction of the data was BLQ; thus, a censored-data likelihood method (M3 method in 
𝐴𝐴GE
NONMEM) was evaluated. However, it is known that some of the limiting factors for using M3 methods 
are the longer runtimes, unsuccessful minimizations, and general instability of the models. Thus, when 
the M3 method was proven to be too unstable to move forward to a covariate step, a left censoring 
method was considered (M6 method in NONMEM). To implement the M6 method, the first BLQ sample 
was imputed to half of the lower limit of quantification, and all other BLQ samples were ignored. The 
change resulted in increased stability of the model, and the M6 method was selected moving forward. 
Given the discrepancy in variability between Phase 3 studies (GS-US-540-9012 and WA42511) and the 
other studies, different IIVs were considered for Phase 3 studies. Variance of residual errors was also 
estimated separately, depending on phase study. 
Simulations were conducted to evaluate RDV, GS-704277, and GS-441524 exposures at Day 1 (area 
under the concentration versus time curve from time 0 to 24 hours [AUC0-24], maximum observed 
concentration [Cmax]); steady-state exposures (area under the concentration versus time curve over 
the dosing interval [AUCtau], Cmax at steady state, observed drug concentration at the end of the dosing 
interval [Ctau], and t1/2); as well as the sum of volume of distribution of all compartments and CL. 
Model Results 
The figure below displays semi-logarithmic plots of RDV, GS-704277, and GS-441524 concentration 
over time. The plots show, in general, a monoexponentially decline in all analyte concentrations after 
administration. For RDV and GS-704277 high variability is described for later timepoints in paediatric 
patients (pink circles).

Figure 2: RDV, GS-704277, and GS-441524 concentration-time after dose profiles 
Plasma concentrations of RDV, GS-704277, and GS-441524 were described following a sequential 
modelling approach by 2-compartment models for RDV and GS-704277 and a 3-compartment model 
for GS-441524 with first-order elimination. The effect of body weight was described by fixed allometry 
by fixing CL-related body weight exponents to 0.75 and volume of distribution-related body weight 
exponents to 1.0. A maturation function was added to accurately describe the CL of RDV and GS-
704277 on the youngest subjects. 
Hospitalised COVID-19 patients, adult and paediatric, had a lower CL (28.1% decrease) of GS-704277. 
Given the lack of non-hospitalised paediatric COVID-19 patient data, it was assumed that the effect of 
hospitalization was the same between adult and paediatric patients. Within the paediatric population, 
baseline ferritin was found to impact the CL (20.1% decrease) of GS-704277, and baseline bilirubin 
was found to impact the CL (25% decrease) of GS-441524. IIV was separately included for Phase 3 
participants versus Phase 1 or Phase 2/3 participants. 
For a 90-kg, 58-year old, hospitalised adult with COVID-19 (a typical adult patient) receiving IV RDV 
200 mg on Day 1 followed by IV RDV 100 mg once daily, the typical RDV CL, intercompartmental CL of 
central compartment (Q), Vc, and peripheral volume of distribution (Vp) values were 59.1 L/h, 6.18 
L/h, 9.11 L, and 8.20 L, respectively. The t1/2 of RDV was 1.03 hours. The typical GS-704277 CL, Q, 
Vc, and Vp values were 247 L/h, 13.7 L/h, 367 L, and 215 L, respectively. The t1/2 of GS-704277 was 
11.5 hours. The typical GS-441524 CL, Q, intercompartmental CL of peripheral compartment (Q2), Vc, 
Vp, and second peripheral volume. 
(Vp2) values were 31.3 L/h, 638 L/h, 55.6 L/h, 193 L, 479 L, and 383 L, respectively. The t1/2 of GS-
441524 was 25.5 hours. It is worth noting that for GS-704277, the calculated t1/2 based on post hoc 
estimations (11.5 hours) was higher than the previously reported t1/2 (2 hours).  
For a 25.4-kg, 8-year old, child with COVID-19 (a typical paediatric patient) (receiving a 5-mg/kg 
loading dose followed by 4 maintenance doses at 2.5 mg/kg of RDV, the typical RDV CL, Q, Vc, and Vp

values were 21.8 L/h, 2.39 L/h, 2.57 L, and 2.31 L, respectively. The t1/2 of RDV was 0.753 hours. 
The typical GS-704277 CL, Q, Vc, and Vp values were 91.2 L/h, 5.31 L/h, 104 L, and 60.7 L, 
respectively. The t1/2 of GS-704277 was 8.43 hours. The typical GS-441524 CL, Q, Q2, Vc, Vp, and 
Vp2 values were 12.1 L/h, 247 L/h, 21.5 L/h, 54.3 L, 135 L, and 108 L, respectively. The t1/2 of GS-
441524 was 18.6 hours.  
The simulation of RDV, GS-704277, and GS-441524 concentration-time profiles for this reference 90-

The univariate analysis to identify significant covariates for the expected steady-state exposure of GS-
704277 in paediatric subjects was evaluated in a sensitivity analysis. The AUCtau and Cmax of GS-
704277 were computed for each of the scenarios based on the final PopPK model. The sensitivity 
analysis results are shown in Figure 9. The range of simulated exposures presented in the black 
shaded bars were based on a dose regimen following protocol specifications. Specifically, subjects in 
Cohorts 1 and 8 were simulated to receive IV RDV 200mg on Day 1 followed by IV RDV 100 mg once 
daily; subjects in Cohorts 2 to 5 were simulated to receive IV RDV 5 mg/kg on Day 1 followed by IV 
RDV 2.5 mg/kg once daily. The exposure of those subjects in Cohorts 1 and 8 was scaled to match a 
weight-base dose regimen. 
Each blue shaded bar represents the influence of single or combined covariates on the steady-state 
exposure. All simulated exposures presented in the blue shaded bars were based on a dose regimen of 
IV RDV 5 mg/kg on Day 1 followed by IV RDV 2.5 mg/kg once daily. The sensitivity analysis identified 
baseline ferritin as the most influential covariate, with a maximum percent change in GS-704277 
exposures ranging from −24.5% to +66.6% (relative to the median exposures) for subjects with 
extreme covariate values. The covariate effect WT was also influential, resulting in GS-704277 
exposures ranging from −37% to +40.9% in paediatric subjects for a body weight based dosing 
regimen.

and Cmax in paediatric subjects 
Similarly, the sensitivity analysis was conducted for GS-441524; the analysis showed that the effect of 
WT and baseline bilirubin was similar, with a maximum percent change in GS-441524 exposures 
ranging from −37.2% to +39.5% (relative to the median exposures) for subjects with extreme WT 
values at the body weight-based dosing regimen and −24.1% to +63.8% for subjects with extreme 
baseline bilirubin values. The identified covariates, including WT and baseline bilirubin on GS-441524 
exposures, accounted for the majority of the observed PK variability, with approximately −52.3% to 
+118% change in AUCtau and approximately −29.2% to +70.9% change in Cmax for subjects with 
extreme covariate values relative to the median exposures. 
In adults, simulations showed that RDV, GS-704277, and GS-441524 exposures were inversely 
correlated with weight, with a percent change in exposures ranging from −33.5% to +44.2% for adult 
patients with extreme covariate values. Weight was found to be the most influential covariate. The 
univariate analysis to identify significant covariates for the expected steady-state exposure of GS-
704277 in adult subjects was evaluated in a sensitivity analysis. The AUCtau and Cmax of GS-704277 
were computed for each of the scenarios based on the final PopPK model. The sensitivity analysis 
results are shown in Figure 11. The sensitivity analysis identified WT as the most influential covariate, 
with a maximum percent change in GS-704277 exposures ranging from −30.1% to +32.2% (relative 
to the median exposures) for subjects with extreme covariate values (i.e., 5th and 95th WT percentiles, 
respectively). The covariate effect of hospitalisation resulted in approximately 28.1% increase in GS-
704277 exposures compared to non-hospitalised patients. The categorical effect of age for subjects 
aged ≥ 60 years had the smallest impact on GS-704277 exposures.

Age as a continuous covariate was not identified as a statistically significant covariate for RDV, GS-
704277, or GS-441524 in the final model in adults. However, age as a categorical covariate (subjects 
60 years or older) was identified as a significant covariate on central volume of GS-704277 and CL of 
GS-441524. The impact of age as a continuous covariate on RDV, for adult COVID-19 patients is 
shown in the table below.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The previous preliminary population PK model was updated and refined using paediatric data and adult 
phase 3 data. The popPK model was developed using plasma concentrations for Remdesivir and two 
metabolites (GS-704277 and GS-441524) using sequential 2-compartment models for RDV and GS-
704277, and a 3-compartment model for GS-441524. Allometric scaling and a maturation function 
were used in the model.

assessment report

The dose selection for children was based on simulations from the PBPK model from 2020, including 
limited adult data and plasma concentrations (without paediatric data). The PBPK model was not 
updated with the new studies (-5823 and -9012), instead exposure in children and adolescents were 
evaluated with the popPK model. Based on the clinical data, the predictions of the old PBPK model are 
not reflective of the measured concentrations in paediatric patients, as plasma concentrations and 
exposures determined in paediatric patients revealed higher values than expected compared to adults. 
However, the interpretation of this data was difficult due to small sample size and high variability in 
phase 3 data. In addition, data from the popPK model indicate that exposure (Cmax and AUC) were 
two-fold higher in paediatric patients compared to adults questioning the dosing strategy or the aimed 
target exposure in paediatric patients. Upon request simulations were provided which the dose 
strategy that would lead to plasma concentrations in paediatric patients that were comparable to 
adults. In addition, boxplots comparing exposure in between children and adults using a linear scale 
were also provided. In light of the information provided, the increase of remdesivir and GS-704277 
concentrations are expected to be transient due to their short half-lifes and on the other hand, the 
concentration of the intracellularly formed metabolite GS-441524 was only slightly affected. Moreover, 
there is no clear correlation between exposure and weight/age and thus the MAH´s conclusion that no 
dose reduction is required is supported from the PK view. However, it was considered more adequate 
to compare the paediatric PK data with the PK data from hospitalised adult patients and the respective 
data were requested for the final conclusion on exposure in paediatric patients. The comparison of PK 
parameters AUC, Cmax and Cmin between the hospitalized paediatric patients (from Study GS-US-540-
5823) and hospitalized adult patients (from Study CO-US-540-5844) were submitted. For the most 
relevant compound (GS-441524), paediatric exposure was comparable to adult exposure in an 
acceptable range. The differences observed seem probably due the uncertainties in exposure 
parameters resulting from very sparse sampling in hospitalized patients. 
From a safety point of view, it is agreed that RDV was well tolerated during clinical studies in paediatric 
patients and the safety data reported during study GS-US-540-5823 are comparable to the studies in 
adults. Overall, no safety signal was identified based on the data provided. 
Baseline ferritin (for GS-704277) and baseline bilirubin (for GS-441524) were revealed as most 
influential covariates in paediatric patients, this was not considered regarding dosing recommendations 
but might be an option to reduce variability.  
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The MAH was asked to justify the higher exposure seen in paediatric patients above 4 weeks of age 
and weighing at least 3.5 kg especially in terms of safety and SBECD exposure. Simulations were 
provided which dose strategy led to plasma concentrations in paediatric patients that are comparable 
to adults. In light of the complementary information provided, the MAH´s conclusion that no dose 
reduction is required is supported from the PK view. The safety data reported during study GS-US-
540-5823 are comparable to the studies in adults. Overall, no safety signal was identified based on the 
data provided.

Treatments 
Regimens: 
Remdesivir for injection, 100 mg, was administered as shown in the table below. 
Shortly, patients below 12 years of age and weighing less than 40 kg received remdesivir according to 
their body weight. 
Table 8: GS-US-540-5823: Study treatments 
Duration of treatment: 
The duration of treatment was up to 10 days. Those participants who demonstrated clinical 
improvement may have been considered for a shorter treatment period. 
Justification of dose and duration of treatment: 
The proposed clinical regimen for the treatment of patients weighing ≥ 40 kg with COVID-19 was as 
follows: single RDV 200 mg IV loading dose on Day 1 followed by RDV 100 mg IV once-daily 
maintenance doses for up to 9 days (Days 2 to 10). 
The proposed clinical regimen for the treatment of patients weighing < 40 kg with COVID-19 (14 days 
old, born full term [gestational age (GA) > 37 weeks]) and with serum creatinine < 0.6 mg/dL) was as 
follows: single RDV 5 mg/kg IV loading dose on Day 1 followed by RDV 2.5 mg/kg IV once-daily 
maintenance doses for up to 9 days (Days 2 to 10).

Selection of this dosing regimen is based on the PK bridge from animal data to human doses and 
efficacy using the results of in vivo efficacy studies conducted in SARS-CoV-2- and Middle East 
respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV-infected rhesus monkeys, available PK data in healthy rhesus 
monkeys, and Phase 1 studies in healthy participants. 
For the treatment of COVID-19, the approach has been to target exposures (plasma and peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells [PBMCs]) associated with efficacy at 10 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg in the SARS-CoV-
2- and MERS-CoV-infected rhesus monkeys. Using allometric scaling, a clinical maintenance dose of 
daily 100 mg for adults provides systemic exposure of RDV in plasma and GS-443902 (active 
triphosphate) in PBMCs similar with that observed in rhesus monkeys at 5 mg/kg IV dose of RDV 
(Study AD-399-2030, Study GS-US-399-5505) (see table below). 
Table 9: Pharmacokinetics of RDV in plasma and nucleoside triphosphate metabolite GS-443902 
(PBMCs) following repeat RDV doses (30 min IV infusion) to healthy monkeys (5mg/kg) and healthy 
humans (100 mg) 
Targeting efficacy seen at 10 mg/kg loading dose in infected rhesus monkeys requires a loading dose 
of 200 mg in humans. As shown in the table above, the PK of a single dose of 200 mg RDV in healthy 
participants is similar to the expected exposure in rhesus monkeys at 10 mg/kg (AUC 5 mg/kg  2 
based on dose proportionality; AD-399-2002). 
High intracellular trough concentrations of the active triphosphate metabolite GS-443902 have been 
observed in human PBMCs following a single RDV 200 mg dose or multiple IV doses of RDV 100 mg 
(Study GS-US-399-5505). These concentrations are approximately 1000-fold above the in vitro half-
maximal effective concentration (EC50) against SARS-CoV-2 (EC50 = 0.0099 μM) and SARS-CoV in 
primary human airway epithelial cells (EC50 = 0.0066 μM). These concentrations are also comparable 
with those observed in rhesus monkeys receiving RDV 5 mg/kg doses for 7 days, and the doses 
associated with efficacy in SARS-CoV-2- and MERS-CoV-infected rhesus monkey models.

Table 10: Pharmacokinetics of plasma RDV and nucleoside triphosphate metabolite GS-443902 
(PBMCs) following a 200 mg single dose of RDV to healthy volunteers 
Dose selection of RDV in paediatric patients was informed by a physiologically based PK (PBPK) model 
developed to characterize the PK of RDV and the primary circulating nucleoside metabolite, GS-
441524, in adults (SimCYP v.17, Certara). The adult PBPK model was used to predict paediatric patient 
exposure, accounting for age-dependent changes in organ volume or size (liver and kidney), esterase 
expression, plasma protein binding, and organ blood flow. Simulations indicated that use of the adult 
dosage regimen in children ≥ 40 kg was predicted to maintain RDV and GS-441524 exposures 
generally within the expected adult steady-state exposure range following the adult dosage regimen. 
For paediatric patients > 14 days old, born full term (GA > 37 weeks) and with serum creatinine below 
thresholds in the table below, a loading dose of 5 mg/kg followed by 2.5 mg/kg once-daily 
maintenance doses of RDV was selected. 
Use of these doses in these paediatric patients was expected to maintain exposures of both RDV and 
GS-441524 at or below that which was previously observed to be well tolerated in healthy volunteers 
(N = 24, GS-US-399-1954). These simulations did not account for possible diminished liver or kidney 
function due to SARS-CoV-2 infection because the impact of infection on the PK of RDV and GS-
441524 was unknown. 
The efficacy of the proposed clinical regimen was being evaluated in patients with COVID-19 and was 
supported by clinical safety data in approximately 500 individuals who had received RDV in Phase 1 
studies, non-Gilead-sponsored studies, and on an expanded-access basis for multiple indications. 
Formulation: 
Remdesivir for injection, 100 mg, was provided by the MAH for study 5823. Investigational product

Table 11: GS-US-5405823: Summary of investigational products 
Remdesivir for injection, 100 mg, is a preservative-free, white to off-white or yellow, lyophilized solid 
containing 100 mg of RDV that is to be reconstituted with sterile water for injection and diluted into 
0.9% saline or 5% dextrose prior to administration by intravenous (IV) infusion. 
In addition to the active ingredient, RDV for injection, 100 mg, contains the following inactive 
ingredients: SBECD, water for injection, hydrochloric acid, and sodium hydroxide. Hydrochloric acid 
and sodium hydroxide are used to adjust the formulation to a pH of 3.0 to 4.0. 
Objectives/Endpoints  
The primary objectives were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of RDV in participants with 
laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 aged 0 days to < 18 years and to evaluate the PK of RDV in 
participants with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 aged 0 days to < 18 years. Nine additional secondary 
endpoints were related to efficacy and virology (see table below).

Table 13: 7-point ordinal scale (taken from Ahmed et al., CROI 2022) 
Assessor’s comment 
It is of note that a 7-point ordinal scale instead of the frequently used 11-point ordinal scale was used. 
The condensation of NIVM and high flow oxygen and IMV and ECMO somewhat limit the impact of 
improvements in clinical status. 
Sample size 
Please refer to Clinical pharmacokinetic. 
Randomisation 
This was an uncontrolled, single-arm open-label study. Participants were enrolled in eight Cohorts by 
age and weight. No other covariates were included in the analyses. 
Blinding  
This was an uncontrolled, single-arm, open-label study, hence all study drugs were open label. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis of efficacy end points were performed using the FAS. No formal statistical testing was 
planned. 
One secondary end point of the study was clinical status assessed using a 7-point ordinal scale, which 
was derived by combining the available death, hospital discharge alive, and ordinal scale assessment 
reported by the site, where death superseded discharge alive and discharge alive superseded the 
ordinal scale score reported by the site. The proportion of participants for each ordinal scale category 
end point was summarized by cohort and expressed as a percentage for presentation purposes. 
Every effort was made to obtain clinical status data for all participants prior to discharge alive. The last 
known clinical status was used for days with missing clinical status (e.g., where the reason for hospital 
discharge is not “discharged alive” and the participant had not died). All post-baseline days with 
missing ordinal scale scores, from Day 2 to Day 10, used the previous last known clinical status. 
Additional details are described in the SAP. 
The following secondary efficacy end points were summarized using descriptive statistics for each 
cohort. Additional details are provided in the SAP. 
•  Clinical improvement, based on scoring using the 7-point ordinal scale, with improvement in 
clinical status indicated by increasing scores (i.e., 1 = death and 7 = not hospitalized). Clinical 
improvement was evaluated by cohort and overall, as follows: 
o  Clinical status and change in clinical status by study day and last available assessment

hospital admission and duration from Day 1) through the Day 30 follow-up visit was also 
summarized. 
•  Days to the first confirmed negative PCR result, where confirmed was defined as 2 consecutive 
negative PCR results, or a negative PCR result at last available sample for participants who 
completed or discontinued from the study, modelled using a competing risk analysis. The

Planned interim analysis 
Prior to the final analysis, an interim analysis conducted by the data monitoring committee (DMC) was 
planned. Interim data reviews by the Sponsor may also be conducted. These reviews may be 
submitted to regulatory agencies to seek guidance regarding the overall clinical development program. 
The DMC has reviewed safety, PK (if available), and efficacy data once approximately 50% of 
participants across the age range of 0 days to < 18 years have reached their Day 10 visit or have been 
discharged, whichever comes first. 
Final analysis 
The final analysis will be performed after all participants have completed the study, outstanding data 
queries have been resolved or adjudicated as unresolvable, and the data have been cleaned and 
finalized. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Participants were enrolled and treated at a total of 19 study sites in Italy, Spain, the US, and the UK. 
Of the 54 participants screened in the study, 53 were enrolled and received at least 1 dose of study 
drug. One participant met all eligibility criteria but was not enrolled in the study due to investigator 
discretion. 
A summary of study participant disposition is presented in the figure and table below.

Recruitment 
Participant were recruited at 19 different sites globally, including two sites in the EU, one site in the UK 
and 13 sites in the US. Of the 53 children, 41 were enrolled in the USA, nine in Spain, two in Italy, and 
one in the UK. 
Cohorts 1 through 5 and 8 were enrolled in parallel. Participants in Cohorts 6 and 7 will only be 
enrolled once RDV exposures have been evaluated from Cohort 5 and a dose has been determined.

Ancillary analyses 
Study GS-US-540-9012 (Pinetree study) 
The study design and methods of study GS-US-540-9012 were already assessed in detail in the 
extension of indication to adult patients who do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at 
increased risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 (for more information please refer to procedure 
EMEA/H/C/005622/II/0016). Therefore, design features are only shortly summarized below. 
Methods 
Study GS-US-540-9012 was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter 
study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment of early stage COVID-19 with IV-administered 
Remdesivir in an outpatient setting in 584 participants with confirmed COVID-19 who were at 
increased risk for disease progression.  
The study was a multi-centre trial, conducted in 64 sites globally. The most common baseline risk 
factors were diabetes mellitus (62%), obesity (56%) and hypertension (48%) and were equally 
distributed across treatment arms. 30% of the enrolled patients were > 60 year of age. Based on 
available virology data, none of the patients was infected with the Delta variant. No vaccinated 
patients were enrolled in study 9012.  Eligible participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the 
two treatment groups (Figure 21). Randomization was stratified by participants who resided in a skilled 
nursing facility, by participant’s age (< 60 vs ≥ 60 years), and by region (US vs ex-US). Participants 
received either study treatment with Remdesivir (RDV) or Placebo to match (PTM) for 3 days and were 
followed up for 28 days. Treatment with Remdesivir/placebo was given for three days. The primary 
efficacy endpoint was COVID-19 related hospitalisation by day 28. The analysis population included 
562 patients (279 patients in the Remdesivir treatment group, and 283 patients in the placebo-arm).

Outcomes and estimation 
Participant flow 
Participants were enrolled and treated across 64 centres in the US, Denmark, Spain, and the UK.  
Of the 630 participants screened, a total of 584 participants were randomized, 292 to receive RDV IV 
for 3 days and 292 to receive placebo for 3 days. Of these, 562 participants (279 in the RDV IV for 3 
days group and 283 in the placebo group) received at least one dose of study treatment and were 
included in the FAS and Safety Analysis Set. Twenty-two participants met all eligibility criteria and 
were not randomized due to the following reasons: withdrew consent (14); outside of visit window (3); 
lost to follow-up (2); other (2); and investigator's discretion (1). Twenty-two randomized participants 
did not receive any study treatment. 
As per protocol, the FAS ITT-population was the primary analysis set.

Baseline data 
Demographic and baseline characteristics 
Of the 8 adolescent participants, 5 were male and 3 were female. The mean (SD) age was 14 (2.3) 
years (range: 13 to 17 years) in the RDV IV for 3 days group and 16 (1.1) years (range: 14 to 17 
years) in the placebo group. All 8 participants were White. Three of the participants were not 
Hispanic/Latino and 5 were Hispanic/Latino. The median (Q1, Q3) weight was 68.0 (61.0, 86.3) kg in 
the RDV IV for 3 days group and 72.2 (65.1, 72.2) kg in the placebo group. The median (Q1, Q3) BMI 
was 25.7 (21.1, 31.7) kg/m2 in the RDV IV for 3 days group and 28.7 (23.2, 29.1) kg/m2 in the 
placebo group. 
Other Baseline Characteristics 
Of the 8 adolescent participants, 6 had a risk factor of chronic lung disease, 2 had a risk factor of 
diabetes mellitus, and 2 had a risk factor of obesity. Median duration of symptoms prior to first dose of 
RDV was 2 days in the RDV IV group and 4 days in the placebo group; median duration from SARS-
CoV-2 nucleic acid/antigen confirmation to first dose of study drug was 0 days in the RDV IV for 3 days 
group and 1 day in the placebo group. Median (Q1, Q3) baseline ALT was 20 (9, 52) U/L and 14 (13, 
44) U/L in the RDV IV for 3 days and placebo group, respectively; median (Q1, Q3) baseline AST was 
20 (17, 38) U/L and 20 (20, 36) U/L, respectively. Median (Q1, Q3) respiration rate was 15 (15, 16) 
breaths/minute and 18 (17, 18) breaths/minute, respectively. Median (Q1, Q3) nasopharyngeal SARS-
CoV-2 viral load was 4.07 (3.88, 7.13) log10 copies/mL in the RDV IV for 3 days group and 7.18 (5.28, 
7.49) log10 copies/mL in the placebo group. 
Primary efficacy endpoint:  
Composite endpoint of COVID-19-related hospitalization or all-cause death by Day 28 
No adolescent participant (12 to < 18 years of age) had COVID-19-related hospitalization or all-cause 
death by Day 28. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints:  
No adolescent participant (12 to < 18 years of age) had a COVID-19–related medically attended visit 
(MAV) or all-cause death by Day 28. No adolescent participant in the RDV IV for 3 days group and 3 
adolescent participants in the placebo group had baseline COVID-19–adapted FLU-PRO Plus 
questionnaire data captured prior to or on the first dosing date. None of the 3 adolescent participants 
in the placebo group reported alleviation (mild or absent) of baseline COVID-19 symptoms through 
Day 14. 
One of the 8 adolescent participants was missing baseline viral load data. There was no difference 
between the RDV IV for 3 days group and the placebo group neither for DAVG7 nor DAVG14 in 
nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral load. The RDV IV for 3 days group and the placebo group had 
similar changes from baseline in nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral load at all time points. At Day 14, 
the mean (SD) change from baseline was −1.68 (1.155) log10 copies/mL in the RDV IV for 3 days 
group and −3.38 (1.991) log10 copies/mL in the placebo group. A negative nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-
2 PCR (viral load) was reported for 1 of 3 participants (33.3%) in the RDV IV for 3 days group and 1 of 
4 participants (25.0%) in the placebo group at Day 14.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study GS-US-540-5823 (CARAVAN) 
Study GS-US-540-5823 (CARAVAN) is a Phase 2/3 single arm, open-label study evaluating the 
safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of remdesivir in participants from birth to <18 years of age 
hospitalized with COVID-19. The primary study endpoints were the proportion of participants 
experiencing treatment-emergent adverse events; proportion of participants experiencing treatment-
emergent graded laboratory abnormalities; and evaluation of plasma concentrations of remdesivir and 
metabolites, respectively. The 10 secondary endpoints related to efficacy include: assessment of 
clinical improvement based on scoring using the 7-point ordinal scale and PEWS score; viral load 
decline; change from baseline in oxygenation use; change from baseline in the use of mechanical 
ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); and time (days) to discharge from 
hospital. The analysis population included 53 patients, which were included in five different age 
Cohorts (Cohort 1: 12 patients; Cohort 2: 12 patients, Cohort 3: 12 patients, Cohort 4: 12 and Cohort 
8: 5 patients). 
Study GS-US-540-5823 is currently ongoing. Therefore, only an interim study report was provided. 
This interim clinical study report (CSR) presents data for Cohorts 1 through 4 and Cohort 8. Due to the 
single-arm design, no firm conclusion on efficacy is possible and the results should be interpreted with 
caution. 
The study protocol was amended three times between study initiation and the time of this interim CSR. 
None of the changes is considered to have impacted the study results. A high number of important 
protocol deviations (IPDs) were reported during the study. Most of them were related to missing data 
related to primary and secondary endpoints (45%) or off-scheduled procedures (39%) through the 
study. According to the MAH, none of the IPDs affected the overall quality or interpretation of the data. 
However, no reasons or further information concerning the missing data related to the primary and 
secondary endpoints were provided. The MAH was asked to provide the respective information. In 
summary, all missing data IPDs were related to secondary efficacy endpoints (apart from the safety-
related endpoint of symptom-driven physical examination at discharge for 1 participant) and data for 
these endpoints are available for participants on other study days. Consequently, the missing data are 
not considered to impact the overall interpretation of the interim Study GS-US- 540-5823 results. It is 
considered unfortunate that particularly a high number of viral load data are missing. 
No vaccinated patients were enrolled in study 9012. The majority of the participants in the FAS were 
female (56.6%). Median age was 15.0 (range: 12.0 to 17.0) years in Cohort 1, 9.0 (range: 4.0 to 
16.0) years in Cohort 2, 3.5 (range: 1.9 to 7.0) years in Cohort 3, 0.5 (range: 0.1 to 0.9) years in 
Cohort 4, and 11.0 (8.0 to 11.0) years in Cohort 8. The majority of participants were White (70.2%) 
and were not Hispanic/Latino (55.8%).

assessment report  
EMA/789715/2022  
Page 73/105 
 
 
 
The median (Q1, Q3) baseline weight was 83.5 (56.8, 106.9) kg in Cohort 1, 26.5 (25.0, 30.9) kg in 
Cohort 2, 14.6 (13.4, 18.2) kg in Cohort 3, 5.0 (4.4, 8.5) kg in Cohort 4, and 73.0 (55.1, 80.0) kg in 
Cohort 8. Median BMI was 33.8 (21.6, 46.5) kg/m2 in Cohort 1, 17.8 (14.9, 20.2) kg/m2 in Cohort 2, 
16.2 (15.6, 18.1) kg/m2 in Cohort 3, 16.3 (14.7, 20.0) kg/m2 in Cohort 4, and 28.0 (27.2, 35.6) 
kg/m2 in Cohort 8. It is of note that 53% of the patients in Cohort 1 and 80% in Cohort 8 had BMI 
higher than the 95th percentile for their age. Hence, all participants weighted considerably more than 
the 40 kg defined in the indication.     
When comparing baseline disease characteristics some differences between the different cohorts were 
noted. The median duration of symptoms prior to the first dose was longer in Cohort 1 (7 days) than in 
the other cohorts (5 day, 3 days, 5 days and 5 days in Cohort 2-4 and Cohort 8, respectively). Median 
creatinine levels were higher and median eGFR was lower in patients of Cohort 1 compared to the 
other cohorts, which could have contributed to the high rate of reported renal failures observed in 
Cohort 1. In addition, median ALT and AST levels were higher in Cohort 1 compared to the other 
cohorts, suggesting that the baseline medical condition of patients in Cohort 1 may have been worse 
than in other cohorts. However, this does not translate into more severe COVID-19 disease, as despite 
the longer duration of symptoms prior to the first dose, the clinical status of patients at baseline in 
Cohort 1 was not worse than in the other cohorts, as only one patient had IMV or ECMO at baseline, 
compared to three, three, five and none in cohorts 2-4 and cohort 8, respectively. Slightly more 
patients in Cohort 1 received non-invasive mechanical ventilation or high-flow oxygen (N=6), 
compared to the other Cohorts (N=4, N=3, N=3 and N=2 in cohorts 2-4 and cohort 8, respectively). 
Overall, the proportion of patients with severe COVID-19 (Ordinal scale score of 2 and 3) was balanced 
between the Cohorts. Furthermore, the median duration of hospitalisation prior to the first dose of RDV 
and the characteristics of medical history were comparable between the cohorts. A question on which 
factors might have led to the differences in safety and efficacy data between cohort 1 (and 8) and 
cohorts 2-4 was posed. The MAH discussed further this issue upon request. It is agreed that the 
efficacy assessments are particularly challenging given the uncontrolled, open-label design of Study 
GS-US-540-5823 in addition to the small number of participants in each cohort. This small number of 
participants in each cohort is an important consideration and limits the ability to interpret reliably any 
apparent differences in safety as well as efficacy across the cohorts and relative to adults who received 
RDV in clinical trials (see also discussion in Clinical Safety). 
In total, 13 of the enrolled study participants were on room air at baseline, while the others needed 
any kind of supportive oxygen (N=12 on IMV/ECMO, N=18 high-flow oxygen an N=10 low-flow 
oxygen). Considering the proposed indication in paediatric patients weighing at least 40 kg, not 
requiring supplemental oxygen, it is important that only four of the 53 participants (N=3 in Cohort 1 
and N=1 in Cohort 1) were on room air at baseline. Hence, data is limited. Further it is notable, that 
12 of the enrolled patients did receive IMV/ECMO at baseline. Considering, that the currently approved 
indication of remdesivir in the EU does not include the subgroup on IMV/ECMO, due to a lack of 
efficacy in this subgroup, it is surprising, that so many children on IMV/ECMO have received 
remdesivir. However, most of the participants were enrolled in the US, where there is no restriction of 
indication.  
Study GS-US-540-9012 (Pinetree) 
Study GS-US-540-9012 (Pinetree) was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
multicenter study to evaluate treatment with IV-administered Remdesivir in an outpatient setting in 
584 participants with confirmed COVID-19 who were at increased risk for disease progression. The 
most common baseline risk factors were diabetes mellitus (62%), obesity (56%) and hypertension 
(48%) and were equally distributed across treatment arms. 30% of the enrolled patients were > 60 
year of age. Based on available virology data, none of the patients was infected with the Delta variant. 
Assessment report on group of variations including an extension of indication 
assessment report  
EMA/789715/2022  
Page 74/105 
 
 
 
Treatment with Remdesivir/placebo was given for three days. The primary efficacy endpoint was 
COVID-19 related hospitalisation by day 28. The analysis population included 562 patients (279 
patients in the Remdesivir treatment group, and 283 patients in the placebo-arm).  
However, only eight adolescents were enrolled in the study of whom three received remdesivir 
treatment.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study GS-US-540-5823 
Initially, the provided paediatric dose justification was not considered sufficient. The dose selection for 
children was based on simulations from the PBPK model of 2020, including limited adult data and 
plasma concentrations (without paediatric data). The PBPK model was not updated with the new 
studies (-5823 and -9012), instead exposure in children and adolescents were evaluated with the 
popPK model. Based on the clinical data, the predictions of the old PBPK model are not reflective of the 
measured concentrations in paediatric patients, as plasma concentrations and exposures determined in 
paediatric patients revealed higher values than expected compared to adults. However, the 
interpretation of this data was difficult due to small sample size and high variability in phase 3 data. In 
addition, data from the popPK model indicate that exposure (Cmax and AUC) were two-fold higher in 
paediatric patients compared to adults questioning the dosing strategy or the aimed target exposure in 
paediatric patients. Hence, the conclusion, that exposures of both RDV and GS-441524 in adolescents 
and children were maintained at or below that which was previously observed to be well tolerated in 
adult healthy volunteers was not agreed with the information submitted firstly (please refer to Clinical 
pharmacology for further information). Therefore, the MAH was asked to justify the two-fold higher 
exposure seen in paediatric patients above 4 weeks of age and weighing at least 3.5 kg especially in 
terms of safety, SBECD exposure and efficacy. The MAH provided the requested data. They compared 
the PK data from Cohorts 1-4 and 8 from study GS-US-540-5823 with the PK data of adult COVID-19 
outpatients (study GS-US-540-9012). Remdesivir AUC and Cmax were increased up to 129% (Cohort 
3). The increase was lowest (33-45%) in Cohorts 1 and 4 (children and adolescence ≥ 40 kg). 
Similarly, the exposure of metabolite GS-704277 increased up to 124%. AUC of the intracellularly 
formed metabolite GS-441524 is mostly comparable between cohorts and only moderately increased 
compared to adult data. Cmax and Ctau were up to 41% (Cohort 4) and 60% (Cohort 1) increased, 
respectively.  
Regarding exposure to the excipient SBECD, it was not higher in paediatric patients compared to 
preliminary data on adult patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Moreover, no trends were 
identified in SBECD exposures across paediatric age and paediatric weight bands. 
The MAH further stated that no trends were identified between PK exposures of either RDV or its 
metabolites, and the most common AEs reported in study GS-US-540-5823. Furthermore, patients 
with an AE of AKI had only moderately increased PK exposures (AUC, Cmax) of GS-441524 (70% to 
100%) and SBECD (12% to 60%). Therefore, from safety view it is agreed that RDV was well tolerated 
during clinical studies in paediatric patients and the safety data reported during study GS-US-540-
5823 are comparable to the studies in adults. Overall, no safety signal was identified based on the data 
provided. 
Due to the single-arm design of the study 5823, the lack of a control arm and as only descriptive 
efficacy data have been presented, no firm conclusion on efficacy in the intended paediatric indication 
is possible. Hence, interpretation of efficacy data should be done with caution.

The definition of recovery in the 5823 study was defined as an improvement from a baseline ordinal 
score of 2 (IMV/ECMO) through 5 (hospitalised, not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring ongoing 
medical care (COVID-19 related or otherwise) to a score of 6 (hospitalised, not requiring supplemental 
oxygen - no longer requires ongoing medical care (other than per protocol RDV administration) or 7 
(not hospitalised) or an improvement from a baseline score of 6 to a score of 7. Hence, the study-
definition of recovery was very bright and should be interpreted with caution. It is of note that a 7-
point ordinal scale instead of the frequently used 11-point ordinal scale was used. The condensation of 
NIVM and high flow oxygen and IMV and ECMO somewhat limit the impact of improvements in clinical 
status and recovery. 
Results of the overall population may be too optimistic, due to the fact, that patients in Cohort 3 were 
not as sick at baseline, as half of the patients had an ordinal score of 5 (on room air, no longer 
requiring ongoing medical care (other than per protocol RDV administration) at baseline. 
Consequently, participants in cohort 3 recovered faster than patients in the other Cohorts. Hence, 
interpretation should also be done based on cohorts to get a better picture on remdesivir’s treatment 
efficacy. One patient in cohort 4 already met the term recovery (baseline ordinal scale of 6) at 
baseline. Only 13 participants (24.5%) received 10 doses of remdesivir. Considering that the majority 
of patients have only received remdesivir for 5 days (36%, N= 19) or less than five days (N=17), 
efficacy outcomes at D5 are also considered important.  
It has been noted that efficacy outcomes in the different cohorts at D5, D10 and last available 
assessment vary between the cohorts, especially between Cohort 1 and the other cohorts. By Day 5, 
28% of the enrolled patients were recovered. Most of them in Cohort 3 (6 patients) and Cohort 2 (4 
patients). Notably, none of the patients in Cohort 1 was recovered. Twelve patients were still on 
IMV/ECMO, and 10 patients were receiving non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen. By day 10, 
60% (N=32) of the enrolled participants met the definition of recovery. However, the effect was again 
mainly driven by cohort 3 (11 patients) and cohort 2 (9 patients) and only 25% of the patients in 
cohort 1 recovered by day 10. At day 10, 20 patients were still in hospital, most of them were enrolled 
in Cohort 1 (N=9) and Cohort 4 (N=6), while only one participant in cohort 3 and cohort 8 and three in 
cohort 2 were still in hospital. Of these, eight required IMV/ECMO, three in cohort 1 and cohort 4 and 
one each in cohort 2 and cohort 8. At the last available assessment, 83% of the enrolled participants 
met the study defined criteria of recovery. In terms of cohorts, all patients in Cohort 3, and 10 of the 
12 patients in Cohort 2 and 4 and 5 patients in Cohort 8 recovered. Recovery rates were lower in 
Cohort 1 (9/12) and Cohort 4 (9/12). In addition, six patients were still in hospital, four receiving 
IMV/ECMO (one in Cohort 1 and three in Cohort 4) and one was still in hospital not requiring 
supplemental oxygen but requiring ongoing medical care (COVID-19 related or otherwise) (Cohort 2). 
In total, three patients died during the study, all of them after day 10. Two patients in Cohort 1 and 
one patient in Cohort 8.  
The proportion of patients with an improvement in clinical status of at least 2 points, was lower in 
Cohort 1 and Cohort 4. By day 5 none of the patients in Cohort 1 showed a clinical improvement. 
Notably, in total eight out of 53 patients did not have had an improvement in clinical status of at least 
2 points at the last assessment available. In line with the findings above, the median (Q1, Q3) time to 
≥ 2-point improvement for participants with an ordinal score of ≤ 5 points at baseline was longer in the 
two cohorts receiving the adult dosing regimen and not the weight-based approach, i.e., Cohort 1 (11 
days (6, 24)) and Cohort 8 (9 days (4, 10). The median (Q1, Q3) time to ≥ 2-point improvement for 
participants with an ordinal score of ≤ 5 points at baseline was shortest for cohort 3 (5 days). 
Recovery, defined as an improvement from a baseline score of 2 through 5 to a score of 6 or 7 or an 
improvement from a baseline score of 6 to a score of 7. Recovery was reported for 62.3% (33/53) of 
all participants (95% CI: 47.9%-75.2%) on Day 10. The proportion of participants that recovered by

D5 was lower in Cohort 1 (3/12 participants) compared to the other cohorts. At the time of last 
available assessment, 9/12 patients in Cohort 1 and Cohort 4 recovered, while all patients in Cohort 3 
have recovered. In total, nine patients did not have recovered at the time of last available assessment. 
Time to recovery was longer in paediatric patients receiving the adult dosing regimen (Cohort 1: 12 
days; Cohort 8: 10 days, compared to Cohort 2 and 4: 7 days and Cohort 3: 5 days). These findings 
raised the question on the necessity of alternative dosing/posology also in this patient population that 
would provide similar exposures compared to adults.  
In general, the overall time to recovery was shorter (7 days) than that seen in adults, which may be 
reflective of the generally observed less severe disease and disease progression in paediatric patients. 
However, as a control arm is missing, these results are difficult to interpret, and no firm conclusion is 
possible. 
In line with the other findings the duration of hospitalisation was significantly longer in paediatric 
patients receiving the adult dosing regimen (Cohort 1: 12 days; Cohort 8: 10 days) compared to those 
receiving the weight-based dosing (Cohort 2 and 4: 7 days and Cohort 3: 5 days). Considering the 
complementary information provided during the assessment for the most relevant compound, 
paediatric exposure was comparable to adult exposure in an acceptable range. Therefore, the posology 
proposed by the MAH is overall considered agreeable. 
PEWS total score for the total population was 0 for 22.6% (12/53) participants; 1, 2, or 3 for 37.7% 
(20/53) participants; 4, 5, or 6 for 24.5% (13/53) participants; and 7, 8, or 9 for 15.1% (8/53) 
participants. By Day 10, no improvement was reported for 32.1% (17/53) participants and increases in 
the PEWS total score were reported for 7.6% (4/53) participants. It is of note that median PEWS score 
reductions were lowest in Cohort 1 (-0.5) and Cohort 8 (0.0) receiving the adult dosing regimen. 
PEWS score data for behaviour, respiratory and cardiovascular were also provided. By Day 10, 
recovery in PEWS behaviour, defined as a baseline score of 1 through 3 improved to a score of 0, was 
reported for 65.5% total participants (19/30 participants; 95% CI: 45.7%-82.1%), for PEWS 
respiratory recovery was reported for 62.9% participants (22/36 participants; 95% CI: 44.9%-78.5%) 
and for PEWS cardiovascular recovery was reported for 63.2% total participants (12/20 participants; 
95% CI: 38.4%-83.7%). Notably, for all tested PEWS scores the rate of patients with no improvement 
at D10 and last available assessment was higher in cohort 1 compared to the other cohorts. 
Confirmed negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR results (defined as 2 consecutive negative results or a negative 
result at the last available sample for participants who completed or discontinued from the study) on 
Day 2 through Day 10 were seen in 42.1% (8/19) total participants with nasal/OP samples, 21.4% 
(6/28) total participants with NP/OP samples and 22.2% (2/9) total participants with ET aspirates. 
However, different sampling techniques to evaluate viral load were used for the study participants, 
namely nasal swabs, NP swaps and endotracheal (ET) aspirates. In addition, the use of the different 
sampling techniques was not balanced between and within Cohorts. Inconsistencies in viral load at 
baseline from different sampling techniques were noted between the different cohorts, as well as 
between the same cohort. Hence, comparability of viral load results between and within cohorts could 
have been severely impacted by the different sampling techniques used. It is impossible, to elucidate if 
the differences observed in viral load are due to the age/weight-characteristics, the baseline disease 
status or due to the different sampling techniques used. Furthermore, time to first negative SARS-CoV-
2 PCR result with confirmation from nasal/OP, NP/OP samples, and ET aspirates were mostly not 
estimable. Taken together, results of the viral load data cannot be considered to draw any firm and 
meaningful conclusion on the antiviral effect of remdesivir in paediatric patients.  Furthermore, due to 
the lack of a control arm it is not possible to conclude on an antiviral effect of remdesivir.

The most common viral lineages detected in paediatric participants in study 5823 were B.1.2, B.1.1.7 
(Alpha) and B.1.429 (Epsilon). None of the participants was infected with the Delta or Omicron variant, 
hence no clinical data on remdesivir’s efficacy in paediatric patients infected with those variants is 
available. 
Two substitutions emerged during remdesivir treatment and were present in combination in 1 
participant: A656P and G670V. Based on analysis of prior cryo-EM structures of the SARS-CoV-2 
polymerase complex {Chen 2020}, A656P and G670V have no direct interaction with the RNA or the 
incoming nucleotide. Neither of these substitutions have been previously associated with resistance to 
RDV.  
No amino acid substitutions were observed in nsp8 or nsp14. Amino acid substitutions in nsp10 were 
observed in 1 (4.3%) out of 23 participants and amino acid substitutions in nsp13 were observed in 2 
(8.7%) out of 23 participants. None of the substitutions were observed in more than one participant 
each. The clinical relevance of the identified mutations in nsp 10 and nsp 13 remain currently unclear. 
Study GS-US-540-9012  
Only eight adolescent participants were enrolled in study GS-US-540-9012, hence the efficacy dataset 
in adolescent patients weighing more than 40 kg who do not require supplemental oxygen and having 
at least one risk factor for progressing to severe disease is considered extremely limited, as only this 
subset is considered supportive for the proposed paediatric outpatient indication. Overall, only three 
adolescent patients received remdesivir in study 9012, of whom only one was female. All eight 
participants were included and completed the study.  
Furthermore, it is notable that the median weight in adolescents treated in study 9012 were 
significantly above 40 kg (RDV: 68.0 (61.0, 86.3) kg, Placebo: 72.2 (65.1, 72.2) kg). Patients treated 
with remdesivir weighted at least 68 kg. Hence, no efficacy data on patients weighing less than 68 kg 
is available.    
Of the eight adolescent patients, six had a risk factor of chronic lung disease, two had a risk factor of 
diabetes mellitus, and two had a risk factor of obesity. No discussion was provided by the MAH, if risk 
factors for progressing to severe COVID-19 are similar between adolescents, children and adults. 
However, current scientific and clinical knowledge indicate that risk factors are similar between adults, 
adolescents and children, hence this issue is not further pursued.   
It is of note that the median duration of symptoms prior to first dose was shorter in the RDV group (2 
days) compared to the placebo group (4 days). In addition, median (Q1, Q3) nasopharyngeal SARS-
CoV-2 viral load was lower in the RDV group (4.07 (3.88, 7.13) log10 copies/mL) compared to the 
placebo group (7.18 (5.28, 7.49) log10 copies/mL).  The eight adolescents were infected with B.1.2.  
Concerning the primary efficacy endpoint, none of the enrolled adolescent participant (12 to < 18 
years of age) had COVID-19-related hospitalization or all-cause death by Day 28, neither in the 
remdesivir group, nor in the placebo group. 
However, no information on the secondary efficacy outcomes were provided by the MAH. The MAH was 
asked to provide the respective information on all relevant secondary and exploratory efficacy 
endpoints, i.e., data on alleviation of symptoms, MVA attendance visits, virology analyses including 
information on variants and the virology endpoints (i.e., viral load decay) of the study. In these data, 
overall, no difference on viral load between the RDV group and the placebo group were detected.

2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy outcomes in the different Cohorts at D5, D10 and last available assessment in study GS-US-
540-5823 vary between the cohorts, especially between Cohort 1 and the other cohorts. However, as a 
control arm is missing, these results are difficult to interpret as well as efficacy.  
Although the results of the PK/PD analyses, showed that there was a significant difference in PK-
exposure in patients with an AE of acute kidney injury, which was seen in more patients in Cohort 1 
than in other cohorts (please refer to the Clinical safety section and PK/PD section for more 
information), the MAH provided complementary data after request that supported the dosing proposed 
(see discussion and conclusion of Clinical Pharmacology). 
From a safety point of view, RDV was well tolerated during clinical studies in paediatric patients and 
the safety data reported during study GS-US-540-5823 were comparable to the studies in adults.

Adverse events 
Study GS-US-540-5823 
Summary of Adverse Events 
A total of 38 participants (71.7%) had at least 1 AE during the study (Cohort 1: 11 participants, 
91.7%; Cohort 2: 7 participants, 58.3%; Cohort 3: 9 participants, 75.0%; Cohort 4: 7 participants, 
58.3%; Cohort 8: 4 participants, 80.0%) (see table below). The overall majority of AEs were Grade 1 
or 2 in severity and considered not related to study drug. 
A total of 15 participants (28.3%) had a Grade 3 or higher AE (Cohort 1: 6 participants, 50.0%; 
Cohort 2: 2 participants, 16.7%; Cohort 3: 1 participant, 8.3%; Cohort 4: 4 participants, 33.3%; 
Cohort 8: 2 participants, 40.0%). Grade 3 or higher AEs were considered related to study drug in 3 
participants (5.7%), all in Cohort 1 (25.0%).  
Serious AEs were reported in 11 participants (20.8%) overall (Cohort 1: 5 participants, 41.7%; Cohort 
2: 2 participants, 16.7%; Cohort 3: 0 participants; Cohort 4: 3 participants, 25.0%; Cohort 8: 1 
participant, 20.0%). None of the serious adverse events (SAEs) were considered related to study drug.

Adverse events leading to premature study drug discontinuation were reported in 2 participants 
(3.8%), both in Cohort 1 (16.7%). 
There were 3 (5.7%) treatment-emergent deaths during the study (1 participant each in Cohorts 1 
[8.3%], 2 [8.3%], and 8 [20.0%]) and 1 non-treatment-emergent death (1 participant died 32 days 
after last dose of RDV) (Table 5; GS-US-540-5823 Interim CSR, Listing 16.2.6.7).

Analysis Set) 
Adverse Events by Severity 
Overall, 15 participants (28.3%) experienced Grade 3 or higher AEs during the study. Grade 3 or 
higher AEs were reported in 6 participants (50%) in Cohort 1, 2 participants (16.7%) in Cohort 2, 1 
participant (8.3%) in Cohort 3, 4 participants (33.3%) in Cohort 4, and 2 participants (40.0%) in 
Cohort 8 (GS-US-540-5823 Interim CSR, Table 15.11.2.1.1). 
Grade 3 or higher AEs were considered related to study drug in three participants (5.7%), all in Cohort 
1 (GS-US-540-5823 Interim CSR, Table 15.11.2.3.1). Study drug-related Grade 3 or higher AEs of ALT 
increased were reported in two participants (16.7%), both in Cohort 1 and both of whom had ALT 
elevations at baseline. None of the Grade 3 or higher AEs related to study drug were SAEs. 
Grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia, Grade 3 ALT increased, and Grade 3 AST increased, all of which were 
related to study drug and which resulted in premature discontinuation of study drug, occurred in one 
participant who eventually died as a result of multiorgan failure. One participant, who had elevated 
ALT and AST at baseline, experienced a Grade 3 study drug-related AE of ALT increased that resulted 
in premature discontinuation of study drug (GS-US-540-5823 Interim CSR, Listing 16.2.6.2). 
Related Adverse Events 
Overall, 8 participants (15.1%) experienced an AE considered related to study drug during the study 
(GS-US-540-5823 Interim CSR, Table 15.11.2.2.2). Study drug-related AEs were reported in 4 
participants (33.3%) in Cohort 1, one participant (8.3%) in Cohort 2, no participants in Cohort 3, one

participant (8.3%) in Cohort 4, and 2 participants (40.0%) in Cohort 8. No study drug-related SAEs 
were reported during the study (GS-US-540-5823 Interim CSR, Table 15.11.2.5.1). 
Individual study drug-related AEs reported in more than one participant were ALT increased (3 
participants [5.7%] overall, 2 in Cohort 1 [16.7%] and 1 in Cohort 4 [8.3%]) and AST increased (2 
participants [3.8%] overall, 1 in Cohort 1 [8.3%] and 1 in Cohort 4 [8.3%]). In Cohort 1, study drug-
related Grade 3 ALT increased in 1 participant and study drug-related Grade 3 ALT increased and 
Grade 3 AST increased in 1 participant resulted in discontinuation of study drug (Section 2.1.5; GS-
US-540-5823 Interim CSR, Listing 16.2.6.6). One participant in Cohort 4 had Grade 2 ALT increased 
and Grade 1 AST increased considered related to study drug (GS-US-540-5823 Interim CSR, Listing 
16.2.6.2). 
Study GS-US-540-9012 
No adolescent participant in the RDV group experienced any AE during the study (GS-US-540-9012 
Final CSR, Table 15.11.2.12). 
One adolescent participant in the placebo group experienced a Grade 1 AE of fatigue that was 
considered not related to the study drug or study procedure (GS-US-540-9012 Final CSR, Table 
15.11.2.1.5 and Listing 16.2.7.1). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Study GS-US-540-5823 
Serious Adverse Events 
Serious AEs were reported in a total of 11 participants (20.8%), including 5 participants (41.7%) in 
Cohort 1, 2 participants (16.7%) in Cohort 2, no participants in Cohort 3, 3 participants (25.0%) in 
Cohort 4, and 1 participant (20.0%) in Cohort 8. None of the SAEs reported during the study were 
considered related to study drug (GS-US-540-5823 Interim CSR, Table 15.11.2.5.1), see table below.

Deaths 
Three treatment-emergent deaths occurred during the study (GS-US-540-5823 Interim CSR, Listing 
16.2.6.7), all in participants with complex medical histories. The cause of death for one participant 
(Cohort 1) was reported as multisystem organ failure (Day 14); this participant, with pre-existing 
elevated transaminases and hyperbilirubinemia (GS-US-540-5823 Interim CSR, Listing 16.2.4.1), had

an SAE of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and prematurely discontinued study drug due to AEs of 
ALT increased, AST increased, blood sodium increased, and hyperbilirubinemia (GS-US-540-5823 
Interim CSR, Listing 16.2.6.4 and Listing 16.2.6.6; Section 3.1.4). The cause of death for one 
participant (Cohort 2), who had SAEs of hypotension, cardiorespiratory arrest, and respiratory failure, 
was reported as respiratory failure secondary to removal from life support (Day 35). For a third 
participant (Cohort 8), who had SAEs of pneumoperitoneum, fatal respiratory distress, haemodynamic 
instability, gastrointestinal necrosis, cardiac failure, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, the 
cause of death was reported as respiratory, cardiac, and kidney failure as well as acute blood loss (Day 
18). 
One non-treatment-emergent death that occurred 32 days after the last dose of RDV was also reported 
(GS-US-540-5823 Interim CSR, Table 15.11.1.1.1). The participant, who had been in Cohort 1 and had 
SAEs during the study of septic shock as well as pulmonary haemorrhage that was considered fatal, 
died as a result of hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to SARS-CoV-2 acute 
respiratory distress syndrome and cytomegalovirus pneumonitis in the setting of systemic lupus 
erythematosus and lupus nephritis. 
Study GS-US-540-9012 
No SAEs were reported during study GS-US-540-9012. 
Laboratory findings 
Study GS-US-540-5823 
There were no clinically relevant changes over time in median values for haematology parameters in 
any cohort (GS-US-540-5823 Interim CSR, Tables 15.11.3.1.1 to 15.11.3.1.4). Median values were 
generally within the relevant reference ranges (GS-US-540-5823 Interim CSR, Listing 16.2.8.10). 
Median values for clinical chemistry parameters were generally within reference ranges (GS-US-540-
5823 Interim CSR, Tables 15.11.3.2.1 to 15.11.3.2.8; Listing 16.2.8.10). 
In general, median ALT increased during RDV dosing and returned to baseline levels by Day 30. The 
changes were considered a result of participants’ underlying medical conditions and severity of COVID-
19 disease and were not clinically significant. No trends were noted in median AST values during the 
study. 
There was no apparent trend in median changes from baseline in total bilirubin values for participants ≥ 
14 days old (GS-US-540-5823 Interim CSR, Table 11.3.2.4 and Figure 11.5.6). 
Median serum creatinine values generally remained stable during the study, with no clinically 
significant changes from baseline. 
No trends were noted in coagulation parameters (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin 
time [aPTT], prothrombin/international normalized ratio [INR]) (GS-US-540-5823 Interim CSR, Tables 
15.11.3.3.1 to 15.11.3.3.3). Prothrombin time was elevated at baseline in all cohorts, and aPTT was 
elevated at baseline except in Cohort 4; both generally remained high throughout RDV dosing (GS-US-
540-5823 Interim CSR, Listings 16.2.4.2 and 16.2.8.11). Concomitant use of enoxaparin or enoxaparin 
sodium and of heparin was reported for 21 (39.6%) and 10 (18.9%) of participants in Cohorts 1 
through 4 and Cohort 8, respectively (GS-US-540-5823 Interim CSR, Table 15.8.5.1.1 and Table 
15.8.5.1.2). 
In the table below Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities reported during Study GS-US-540-5823 are 
shown.

Study GS-US-540-9012 
No clinically relevant findings were observed in haematology, chemistry, or coagulation parameters in 
the adolescent participants (GS-US-540-9012 Final CSR, Listings 16.2.8.1 through 16.2.8.8). 
No adolescent participant experienced Grade 3 or higher laboratory abnormality (GS-US-540-9012 
Final CSR, Listings 16.2.8.11). 
Safety in special populations 
No intrinsic and extrinsic factors were assessed for participants ≥ 28 days to < 18 years old for the 
interim analysis of Study GS-US-540-5823 or the final analysis of Study GS-US-540-9012; therefore, 
no new findings relevant to intrinsic and extrinsic factors are submitted with this update to the initial 
application. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No clinical drug-drug interaction studies have been completed with RDV.

Two participants (3.8%) prematurely discontinued study drug due to AEs, both in Cohort 1 (16.7%) 
(GS-US-540-5823 Interim CSR, Table 15.11.2.5.3). One participant prematurely discontinued study 
drug after 5 doses of RDV because of AEs of Grade 3 ALT increased, Grade 3 AST increased, Grade 4 
blood sodium increased, and Grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia; this participant had elevated transaminases

and hyperbilirubinemia at study entry and died on Day 14 as a result of multisystem organ failure 
(Section 2.1.3 and Section 3.1.4; GS-US-540-5823 Interim CSR, Listing 16.2.6.6). With the exception 
of blood sodium increased, the events were considered related to study drug. One participant, who had 
elevated ALT and AST at baseline, prematurely discontinued study drug after 3 doses of RDV because 
of Grade 3 ALT increased, which was considered related to study drug (Sections 2.1.2.2 and 2.1.2.3; 
GS-US-540-5823 Interim CSR, Listing 16.2.8.3). None of the AEs that resulted in premature study 
drug discontinuation were reported as SAEs. 
Study GS-US-540-9012 
None of the three adolescent patients treated during Study GS-US-540-9012 discontinued treatment 
due to AEs. 
Post marketing experience 
No post marketing safety data were submitted. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Overall, 53 paediatric patients (with laboratory confirmed COVID-19, hospitalised and requiring 
medical care for COVID-19) received up to 10 doses of IV RDV during open-label Study GS-US-540-
5823. Furthermore, three adolescent patients were treated with 3 doses of IV RDV in an outpatient 
setting (confirmed COVID-19 who were at increased risk for disease progression) during the 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Study GS-US-540-9012. 
During Study GS-US-540-5823, overall, in 38 patients (71.7%) at least 1 AE was reported. The rate 
of reported AEs was highest in Cohort 1 (11 patients [91.7%]) compared to the other cohorts (Cohort 
2: 7 patients [58.3%]; Cohort 3: 9 patients [75.0%]; Cohort 4: 7 patients [58.3%]; Cohort 8: 4 
patients [80.0%]). When comparing with clinical studies conducted in adult hospitalized patients with 
COVID-19, the overall rate of AEs reported during Study GS-US-540-5823 is in principle comparable to 
the studies in adults (GS-US-540-5773: RDV for 5 Days 70.5%, RDV for 10 Days 73.6%; GS-US-540-
5774: RDV for 5 Days 50.8%, RDV for 10 Days 54.9%; CO-US-540-5776 (only Grade 3 or 4 AEs 
reported, where the rate in Study GS-US-540-5823 was 28.3%): 28.8%; CO-US-540-5758: 66%).  
However, the high rate of AEs in Cohort 1 needs further discussion, even if only a small number of 
patients was included in Cohort 1 (n=12) and the relevance of the reported rate is limited. In line with 
this finding, more patients in Cohort 1 had a Grade 3 or higher AE (6 patients [50.0%]) compared to 
the other cohorts (Cohort 2: 2 patients [16.7%]; Cohort 3: 1 patients [8.3%]; Cohort 4: 4 patients 
[33.3%]; Cohort 8: 2 patients [40.0%]) and the only 3 patients with Grade 3 or higher AEs considered 
related to study drug were from Cohort 1 [25.0%]. Furthermore, more SAEs were reported in Cohort 1 
(5 patients [41.7%]) compared to the other cohorts (Cohort 2: 2 patients [16.7%]; Cohort 3: 0 
patients; Cohort 4: 3 patients [25.0%]; Cohort 8: 1 patient [20.0%]). However, none of the serious 
adverse events (SAEs) were considered related to study drug. Nevertheless, AEs leading to premature 
study drug discontinuation were only reported in two patients in Cohort 1 [16.7%] and none in the 
other cohorts. The reported rates of AEs and Grade 3 or higher AE in Cohort 8 were intermediate 
between those of Cohort 1 and Cohorts 2-4, however, due to the small number of patients treated in 
Cohort 8 (n=5), it is even more difficult to draw a conclusion here.  
When comparing baseline disease characteristics, it appears that the median duration of symptoms 
prior to first dose of RDV was higher in Cohort 1 (7 days) than in the other cohorts (Cohort 2: 5 days; 
Cohort 3: 3 days; Cohort 4: 5 days; Cohort 8: 5 days) which could refer to a worse disease condition. 
Assessment report on group of variations including an extension of indication 
assessment report  
EMA/789715/2022  
Page 88/105 
 
 
 
However, the median duration of hospitalisation prior to the first dose of RDV was comparable between 
cohorts. Furthermore, no differences in oxygen support status at baseline and COVID-19–related 
disease manifestations between cohorts could be identified. In addition, characteristics of medical 
history seem to be comparable between cohorts. 
In Cohorts 1 and 8 a fixed dose of RDV was administered (IV RDV 200 mg on day 1 followed by IV 
RDV 100 mg daily for up to 10 days), whereas in Cohorts 2-4 a weight-based dosage was used (IV 
RDV 5 mg/kg on day 1 followed by IV RDV 2.5 mg/kg daily for up to 10 days). Therefore, the question 
arises to what extent differences in the PK profile could have led to differences in the safety data. 
When comparing PK data, AUCtau and Cmax of RDV and metabolites GS-704277 and GS-441524 in 
Cohorts 1 and 8 were lower than in Cohorts 2, 3 and 4. Compared to data from adults treated with 
RDV, AUCtau and Cmax were significantly higher in the paediatric population (RDV AUCtau 200.3%, Cmax 
193.3%; GS-704277 AUCtau 151.9%, Cmax 180.4%; GS-441524 AUCtau 94.9%, Cmax 110.2%). For the 
discussion and conclusion of the appropriateness of the dosages in the paediatric populations, please 
see section PK/PD. In this regard, after evaluating the requested information the Committee agreed on 
the dosing proposed and on the MAH´s conclusion that no dose reduction is required, and it is 
supported from the PK view (see discussion and conclusion of Clinical Pharmacology).  
For the safety assessment of Study GS-US-540-5823 it can be concluded that PK data from Cohorts 1 
and 8 compared to Cohorts 2-4 do not explain differences in rates of reported AEs, Grade 3 or higher 
AEs and SAEs. Upon request, the MAH discussed which factors might have contributed to the 
differences in efficacy and safety data between Cohort 1 (and 8) and Cohorts 2-4 of Study GS-US-540-
5823, including a potential role of SBECD exposure. Overall, some differences in terms of baseline 
characteristics between cohorts were identified which could suggest that participants in Cohorts 1 and 
8 may have had more severe COVID-19. However, other characteristics such as presence of complex 
medical conditions were similar between cohorts. It is outlined that any discrepancies in efficacy 
assessments are confounded by the small number of participants in each cohort as well as the open-
label, uncontrolled study design which is agreed. Furthermore, it is concluded that the higher 
percentages of participants with any AE, Grade 3 or higher AEs, and SAEs in Cohort 1 may reflect the 
small sample number in each cohort. According to the analysis of the MAH no association was 
identified with common AEs or with AKI and PK exposures of RDV and its metabolites or with SBECD 
concentrations. Overall, the argumentation of the MAH is agreed. No safety signal was identified during 
Study GS-US-540-5823 and it seems most likely that the differences observed between cohorts reflect 
the small sample size and study design. 
In Cohorts 1 and 8 numerically more patients experienced AEs of constipation (Cohort 1: 3 patients 
[25%], Cohort 2: 1 patient [8.3%]; Cohort 3: 1 patient [8.3%]; Cohort 4: 2 patients [16.7%]; Cohort 
8: 3 patients [60.0%]). Furthermore, AEs of acute kidney injury were more frequently reported in 
Cohort 1 (Cohort 1: 4 patients [33.3%], Cohort 2: 0 patients; Cohort 3: 0 patients; Cohort 4: 1 
patient [8.3%]; Cohort 8: 1 patient [20.0%]). According to the interim CSR, at baseline median 
creatinine levels were higher and median eGFR was lower in patients of Cohort 1 compared to the 
other cohorts which could possibly be related to the differences in rates of acute kidney injury. 
However, no further information is available. Of the reported cases of acute kidney injury, one AE was 
considered as SAE and the remaining AEs as non-serious AEs. Case narratives were not presented for 
all cases of acute kidney injury in the interim CSR. For a profound assessment, the Applicant was 
requested to provide details of all reported cases of acute kidney injury during Study GS-US-540-5823 
including causality assessments. Furthermore, a possible causal relationship to plasma concentrations 
of SBECD were further discussed and a comparison of plasma concentrations of SBECD between 
paediatric patients and adults after treatment with RDV requested. On view of the information provided 
as stated above and according to the analysis of the MAH no association was identified with common 
AEs or with AKI and PK exposures of RDV and its metabolites or with SBECD concentrations. This is 
Assessment report on group of variations including an extension of indication 
assessment report

agreed. No safety signal was identified during Study GS-US-540-5823. The differences observed 
between cohorts are likely reflecting the small sample size and study design. 
Overall, however, the AEs reported during Study GS-US-540-5823 are in accordance with the AEs 
reported during clinical studies conducted in adult hospitalised patients with COVID-19.  
The reported rate of AEs considered related to study drug during study GS-US-540-5823 (8 patients 
[15.1%]) was comparable to rates in clinical studies investigated RDV in hospitalised patients. The 
reported adverse reactions are in general in accordance with the known safety profile of RDV.  
The overall rate of reported SAEs (20.8%) was comparable to rates reported in clinical studies in adult 
hospitalised COVID-19 patients (Study CO-US-540-5776: 21.1%, Study CO-US-540-5758: 18%). The 
listed PTs were only reported as single cases. None of the SAEs reported during the study were 
considered related to study drug. 
During Study GS-US-540-5823 three treatment-emergent deaths occurred, all in patients with 
complex medical histories. One patient died due to multisystem organ failure on day 14. This patient 
from Cohort 1 had elevated transaminases and hyperbilirubinemia at baseline, developed an SAE of 
multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and prematurely discontinued study drug due to AEs of ALT 
increased, AST increased, blood sodium increased, and hyperbilirubinemia. For the second patient from 
Cohort 2 the cause of death was reported as respiratory failure secondary to removal from life support 
(Day 35). This patient developed SAEs of hypotension, cardiorespiratory arrest, and respiratory failure. 
The third patient (Cohort 8) died due to respiratory, cardiac, and kidney failure as well as acute blood 
loss on Day 18. For this patient SAEs of pneumoperitoneum, fatal respiratory distress, haemodynamic 
instability, gastrointestinal necrosis, cardiac failure, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome were 
reported.  
Furthermore, one non-treatment-emergent death was reported. This patient from Cohort 1 died 32 
days after the last dose of RDV due to hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to 
SARS-CoV-2 acute respiratory distress syndrome and cytomegalovirus pneumonitis in the setting of 
systemic lupus erythematosus and lupus nephritis. 
The Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities reported during Study GS-US-540-5823 were in accordance 
with laboratory abnormalities documented for clinical studies in adult hospitalized COVID-19 patients. 
Two patients prematurely discontinued study drug due to AEs, both in Cohort 1.  
During Study GS-US-540-9012 no adolescent patient in the RDV group experienced any AE. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, RDV was well tolerated during clinical studies in paediatric patients. The overall rate of AEs, 
AEs considered related to study drug and SAEs reported during Study GS-US-540-5823 was 
comparable to clinical studies which investigated RDV in adult hospitalized patients with COVID-19. No 
safety signal could be identified. Differences in safety data between Cohort 1 (and 8) and Cohorts 2-3 
were observed and further discussed. It is concluded that the higher percentages of participants with 
any AE, Grade 3 or higher AEs, and SAEs in Cohort 1 may reflect the small sample number in each 
cohort. According to the analysis of the MAH no association was identified with common AEs or with 
AKI and PK exposures of RDV and its metabolites or with SBECD concentrations which is overall 
agreed. No safety signal was identified during Study GS-US-540-5823 and it seems most likely that 
the differences observed between cohorts reflect the small sample size and study design.

Exposure to the excipient SBECD was not higher in paediatric patients compared to preliminary data 
on adult patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Moreover, no trends were identified in 
SBECD exposures across paediatric age and paediatric weight bands 
The significance of the results is limited due to the small numbers of patients treated in each cohort.  
In addition, safety data from the three adolescent patients from Study GS-US-540-9012 with 
confirmed COVID-19 who were at increased risk for disease progression and received 3 doses of RDV 
in an outpatient setting, are regarded as too limited to draw any firm conclusion on the safety profile 
of RDV in this patient population. However, no AES were reported in the adolescents included in this 
study.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC have 
been updated. The Package Leaflet as well as the instructions for healthcare professionals have been 
updated accordingly.  In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to 
update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
MAH show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.7.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Veklury (remdesivir) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as <include reason(s) as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 
January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The human disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been designated COVID-19 and was first detected in 
Wuhan, China in December 2019. In most (~80%) cases, COVID-19 presents as a mild-to-moderately 
severe, self-limited acute respiratory illness with fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Symptoms are 
thought to appear 2 to 14 days after exposure. COVID-19 can be severe, resulting in pneumonia, 
severe acute respiratory syndrome, hypercoagulation, kidney failure, and death. 
The vulnerability of children to infection with SARS-CoV-2 is expected to be equivalent to that of 
adults; however, similar to SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 
infection appears to be less common in children {Cruz 2020, Dong 2020, Lee 2020, Zimmermann 
2020}. With moderate to severe COVID-19, both populations display similar symptoms. Although 
COVID-19 infections usually lead to mild or moderate symptoms in children, some progress to severe 
disease and require hospitalization (49.7 per 100,000 cases at Coronavirus Disease 2019 Associated 
Hospitalization Surveillance Network sites in the US from 01 March 2020 to 14 August 2021 and 0.1%-
0.2% in Europe from 04 January to 20 June 2021) {Delahoy 2021, European Centre for Disease 
Prevention and Control 2021}. 
More than 2 years after identification of SARS-CoV-2, the pandemic continues to burden healthcare 
systems worldwide. New variants have also evolved, such as the alpha, delta and omicron variants, 
that challenge the ability to end the pandemic. As children in the US returned to schools in the fall of 
2021, the number of cases of COVID-19 and of hospitalizations increased with higher numbers in 
school districts without a universal masking policy {Budzyn 2021, Jehn 2021}. While vaccination 
against COVID-19 infection is effective in preventing COVID-19, vaccines are not yet available for all 
children and breakthrough cases of COVID-19 can occur in those who are vaccinated.  
There is no regulatory guidance on SARS-CoV-2 drug development. Concerning endpoints, an impact 
on mortality would be the most clinically relevant as well as scientifically persuasive outcome of a 
study in COVID-19. However, this may not be readily demonstrated in a study program, due to its 
limited size and/or limited effects of the treatment administered. 
Notably, mortality is not the only clinically relevant endpoint. In analogy with developments in the 
influenza field, an ordinal scale for classifying patient response at a given day or as a time to recovery 
endpoint, was proposed by WHO, and has been used in several trials, including all four RCTs that are 
relevant to this application. Provided that the study is efficiently double-blinded, these are anticipated 
to produce unbiased effect estimates.  
Anti-influenza agents have been approved based on an impact on time to recovery. Such endpoints are 
considered to capture clinical benefit for COVID-19 also, both in terms of the alleviation of symptoms 
and suffering, as well as in terms of saving public health resources.

3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In the EU currently two vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection are approved for paediatric patients. 
Corminaty for children aged five years and older and Spikevax for children aged six years and older. 
Dexamethasone can be used in the EU to treat COVID-19 in adolescents aged 12 years and older and 
weighing at least 40 kg after EMA's CHMP completed its review under Article 5(3). Treatment with 
Dexamethasone have been proven effective and safe in the treatment of severe COVID-19 of severe 
COVID-19 in adolescents aged 12 years and older and weighing at least 40 kg and require 
supplemental oxygen. Furthermore, Remdesivir is approved for the treatment of COVID-19 in 
adolescent patients aged 12 years and older and weighing at least 40 kg who require low-flow oxygen, 
high-flow oxygen or non-invasive mechanical ventilation at the start of therapy. 
Currently, some monoclonal antibodies are approved for the treatment of mild and moderate COVID-
19 infection in adolescent patients outside the hospital setting, Xevudy (sotrovimab) and Ronapreve 
(casirivimab/imdevimab). Xevudy and Ronapreve are indicated for treating COVID-19 in adults and 
adolescents (from 12 years of age and weighing at least 40 kilograms) who do not require 
supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk of their disease becoming severe. Ronapreve can 
also be used for preventing COVID-19 in people aged 12 years and older weighing at least 40 
kilograms.  Evushed was approved for preventing COVID-19 in people aged 12 years and older 
weighing at least 40 kilograms.  
Currently, there are no approved antiviral treatments for the treatment of COVID-19 in children and 
adolescents below the age of 12 or weighing less than 40 kg. 
In addition, paediatric patients with COVID-19 are treated with relevant supportive care, including 
e.g., oxygen, mechanical ventilation and other life support, as required. 
While vaccination against COVID-19 infection is effective in preventing COVID-19, vaccines are not yet 
available for all children and breakthrough cases of COVID-19 can occur in those who are vaccinated. 
There is a high medical need for an effective agent for treatment of COVID-19 for children and 
adolescents especially for those below 12 years of age or weighing less than 40 kg. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
There are two studies supporting the clinical efficacy and safety of RDV for the treatment of COVID-19 
in children and adolescents below 18 years of age: 
Study GS-US-540-5823 
The study supporting the clinical efficacy and safety of RDV for the treatment of COVID-19 in paediatric 
patients aged ≥ 28 days to < 18 years of age and weighing ≥ 3 kg with pneumonia requiring oxygen 
(low- or high-flow oxygen or other non -invasive ventilation at start of treatment) is the ongoing Phase 
2/3 uncontrolled, open-label, single arm study (GS-US-540-5823) evaluating the safety, tolerability, 
PK, and efficacy of RDV in paediatric participant in 53 participants from birth to < 18 years of age. 
Study GS-US-540-9012 
The study supporting the clinical efficacy and safety of remdesivir in paediatric patients >12 years of 
age weighing at least 40 kg who do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk of 
progressing to severe COVID-19 is the phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
multicenter study (GS-US-540-9012) evaluating the efficacy and safety of treatment of early stage 
COVID-19 with IV-administered Remdesivir in an outpatient setting in 584 participants with confirmed 
COVID-19 who were at increased risk for disease progression.

For study GS-US-540-9012 only the subset of eight adolescents with COVID-19 were considered.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Study GS-US-540-5823 (CARAVAN) 
Study GS-US-540-5823 (CARAVAN) is a Phase 2/3 single arm, open-label study evaluating the safety, 
tolerability and pharmacokinetics of remdesivir in participants from birth to <18 years of age 
hospitalized with COVID-19. The primary study endpoints were the proportion of participants 
experiencing treatment-emergent adverse events; proportion of participants experiencing treatment-
emergent graded laboratory abnormalities; and evaluation of plasma concentrations of remdesivir and 
metabolites, respectively. The 10 secondary endpoints related to efficacy include: change from 
baseline in oxygenation use; change from baseline in the use of mechanical ventilation or 
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); assessment of clinical improvement based on scoring 
using the 7-point ordinal scale; and time (days) to discharge from hospital. The analysis population 
included 53 patients, which were included in five different age Cohorts (Cohort 1: 12 patients; Cohort 
2: 12 patients, Cohort 3: 12 patients, Cohort 4: 12 and Cohort 8: 5 patients). 
Based on the provided data, 62.3% participants (33/53, 95% CI: 47.9%-75.2%) from the overall 
enrolled population recovered by Day 10 as measured by the 7-point ordinal scale for clinical status, 
while 83.0% of the overall participants (44/53, 95% CI: 70.2%-91.9%) have recovered at the time of 
the last assessment. 
By Day 10, 60.4% (32/53) and by Day 30, 83.0% (44/53) of the overall enrolled population were 
discharged from the hospital alive.  
The median (Q1, Q3) changes from baseline in clinical status reported for the overall participants on 
Day 10 and at the time of the last assessment were 2.0 (1.0, 4.0) points and 3.0 (2.0, 4.0) points. 
Confirmed negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR results on Day 2 through Day 10 were reported for 42.1% (8/19) 
total participants with nasal/oropharyngeal (OP) samples, 21.4% (6/28) total participants with NP/OP 
samples, and 22.2% (2/9) total participants with ET aspirates. 
PEWS total score for the total population was 0 for 22.6% (12/53) participants; 1, 2, or 3 for 37.7% 
(20/53) participants; 4, 5, or 6 for 24.5% (13/53) participants; and 7, 8, or 9 for 15.1% (8/53) 
participants. 
Study GS-US-540-9012 (Pinetree) 
Study GS-US-540-9012 (Pinetree) was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
multicenter study to evaluate treatment with IV-administered Remdesivir in an outpatient setting in 
584 participants with confirmed COVID-19 who were at increased risk for disease progression. The 
most common baseline risk factors were diabetes mellitus (62%), obesity (56%) and hypertension 
(48%) and were equally distributed across treatment arms. 30% of the enrolled patients were > 60 
year of age. Based on available virology data, none of the patients was infected with the Delta variant. 
Treatment with Remdesivir/placebo was given for three days. The primary efficacy endpoint was 
COVID-19 related hospitalisation by day 28. The analysis population included 562 patients (279 
patients in the Remdesivir treatment group, and 283 patients in the placebo-arm). Only eight 
adolescents were enrolled in the study of whom three received remdesivir treatment. 
None of the eight enrolled adolescent participant (12 to < 18 years of age) had COVID-19-related 
hospitalization or all-cause death by Day 28, neither in the remdesivir group, nor in the placebo group

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
GS-US-540-5823 
Due to the single-arm design of the study 5823, the lack of a control arm and as only descriptive 
efficacy data have been presented, efficacy data from study 5823 are of limited value. No firm 
conclusion on efficacy in the intended paediatric indication is possible. 
The exposure in Cmax and AUC of remdesivir and its metabolites were up to 2.3-fold higher in 
paediatric patients compared to adult outpatients.  However, no trends were identified between PK 
exposures of either RDV nor its metabolites and the most common AEs reported in study GS-US-540-
5823. Moreover, exposure of the intracellular metabolite GS-441524 which is considered the most 
relevant metabolite, and which has the longest half-life is mostly comparable between cohorts and only 
moderately increased compared to data from adult outpatients. 
Nine participants were not discharged alive by Day 30, of these seven were still hospitalized (2 in each 
of Cohorts 1 and 2; 3 in Cohort 4) and two had died (1 each in Cohorts 1 and 8). 
By Day 10, no improvement in PEWS score was reported for 32.1% (17/53) participants; increases in 
the PEWS total score were reported for 7.6% (4/53) participants.  
Efficacy outcomes (clinical improvement, recovery, hospital discharge, hospital duration improvement 
in PEWS score) in the different Cohorts at D5, D10 and last available assessment vary between the 
cohorts, especially between Cohort 1 and the other cohorts. The MAH provided additional analysis, 
however, it remains unclear, which factors might have contributed to the differences in efficacy and 
safety data between Cohort 1 (and 8) and Cohorts 2-4. Exposure to the excipient SBECD was not 
higher in paediatric patients compared to preliminary data on adult patients with mild to moderate 
renal impairment. Moreover, no trends were identified in SBECD exposures across paediatric age and 
paediatric weight bands. Overall, it is concluded that the number of patients treated in the different 
cohorts is too limited to draw any conclusion based on the observed differences. 
Data supporting the efficacy of remdesivir in patients aged at least 4 weeks and weighing at least 3.5 
kg with pneumonia who require supplemental oxygen (low-flow, high-flow or non-invasive mechanical 
ventilation at the start of therapy) is considered limited.  
None of the participants was infected with the Delta or Omicron variant, hence no clinical data on 
remdesivir’s efficacy in paediatric patients infected with those variants is available. 
No vaccinated patients were enrolled in study 5823. 
Different sampling techniques to evaluate viral load were used for the study participants, namely nasal 
swabs, NP swaps and endotracheal (ET) aspirates, which were not balanced between and within 
cohorts. Comparability of viral load results between and within cohorts could have been severely 
impacted by the different sampling techniques used. 
GS-US-540-9012: 
Only eight adolescent participants were enrolled in study GS-US-540-9012, of which only three 
adolescent patients received remdesivir. The efficacy dataset in adolescent patients weighing more 
than 40 kg and having at least one risk factor for progressing to severe disease is extremely limited. 
Median weight in adolescents treated in study 9012 were significantly above 40 kg. Patients treated 
with remdesivir weighted at least 68 kg. No efficacy data on patients weighing less than 68 kg is 
available.    
No vaccinated patients were enrolled in study 9012.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall, 53 paediatric patients (laboratory confirmed COVID-19, hospitalized and requiring medical 
care for COVID-19) received up to 10 doses of RDV during open-label Study GS-US-540-5823. 
Furthermore, 3 adolescent patients were treated with 3 doses of RDV in an outpatient setting 
(confirmed COVID-19 who were at increased risk for disease progression) during the randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled Study GS-US-540-9012. In general, RDV was well tolerated during 
clinical studies in paediatric patients. 
During Study GS-US-540-5823, overall, in 38 patients (71.7%) at least 1 AE was reported. The rate 
of reported AEs was highest in Cohort 1 (11 patients [91.7%]) compared to the other cohorts (Cohort 
2: 7 patients [58.3%]; Cohort 3: 9 patients [75.0%]; Cohort 4: 7 patients [58.3%]; Cohort 8: 4 
patients [80.0%]). When comparing with clinical studies conducted in adult hospitalized patients with 
COVID-19, the overall rate of AEs reported during Study GS-US-540-5823 is comparable to the studies 
in adults.  
The reported rate of AEs considered related to study drug during study GS-US-540-5823 (8 patients 
[15.1%]) was comparable to rates in clinical studies conducted RDV in hospitalised patients. The 
reported adverse reactions are in general in accordance with the known safety profile of RDV.  
The overall rate of reported SAEs (20.8%) was comparable to rates reported in clinical studies in adult 
hospitalised COVID-19 patients (Study CO-US-540-5776: 21.1%, Study CO-US-540-5758: 18%). The 
listed PTs were only reported as single cases. None of the SAEs reported during the study were 
considered related to study drug. 
During Study GS-US-540-5823 three treatment-emergent deaths occurred, all in patients with 
complex medical histories. No safety signal could be identified based on these cases. 
Two patients prematurely discontinued study drug due to AEs, both in Cohort 1.  
During Study GS-US-540-9012 no adolescent patient in the RDV group experienced any AE 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
During Study GS-US-540-5823 the reported rate of AEs in Cohort 1 was higher compared to the 
other cohorts. In line with this finding, more patients in Cohort 1 had a Grade 3 or higher AE (6 
patients [50.0%]) compared to the other cohorts (Cohort 2: 2 patients [16.7%]; Cohort 3: 1 patients 
[8.3%]; Cohort 4: 4 patients [33.3%]; Cohort 8: 2 patients [40.0%]) and the only 3 patients with 
Grade 3 or higher AEs considered related to study drug were from Cohort 1 [25.0%]. Furthermore, 
more SAEs were reported in Cohort 1 (5 patients [41.7%]) compared to the other cohorts (Cohort 2: 2 
patients [16.7%]; Cohort 3: 0 patients; Cohort 4: 3 patients [25.0%]; Cohort 8: 1 patient [20.0%]). 
However, none of the serious adverse events (SAEs) were considered related to study drug. 
Nevertheless, AEs leading to premature study drug discontinuation were only reported in 2 patients in 
Cohort 1 [16.7%] and none in the other cohorts. The reported rates of AEs and Grade 3 or higher AE 
in Cohort 8 were intermediate between those of cohort 1 and cohorts 2-4, however, due to the very 
low number of patients treated in Cohort 8 (n=5), it is even more difficult to draw a conclusion here. 
When comparing baseline disease characteristics, it appears that the median duration of symptoms 
prior to first dose of RDV was higher in Cohort 1 (7 days) than in the other cohorts (Cohort 2: 5 days; 
Cohort 3: 3 days; Cohort 4: 5 days; Cohort 8: 5 days) which could refer to a worse disease condition. 
However, the median duration of hospitalisation prior to the first dose of RDV was comparable between 
cohorts. Furthermore, no differences in oxygen support status at baseline and COVID-19–related 
disease manifestations between cohorts could be identified. In addition, characteristics of medical 
Assessment report on group of variations including an extension of indication 
assessment report

history seem to be comparable between cohorts. Furthermore, PK data from Cohorts 1 and 8 
compared to Cohorts 2-4 did not explain differences in rates of reported AEs, Grade 3 or higher AEs 
and SAEs. The MAH further analysed which factors might have contributed to the differences in safety 
data between Cohort 1 (and 8) and Cohorts 2-4, however, no respective factors have been identified. 
Overall, it is concluded that the number of patients treated in the different cohorts is too limited to 
draw any conclusion based on the observed differences. 
In Cohorts 1 and 8 numerically more patients experienced AEs of constipation (Cohort 1: 3 patients 
[25%], Cohort 2: 1 patient [8.3%]; Cohort 3: 1 patient [8.3%]; Cohort 4: 2 patients [16.7%]; Cohort 
8: 3 patients [60.0%]). Furthermore, AEs of acute kidney injury were more frequently reported in 
Cohort 1 (Cohort 1: 4 patients [33.3%], Cohort 2: 0 patients; Cohort 3: 0 patients; Cohort 4: 1 
patient [8.3%]; Cohort 8: 1 patient [20.0%]). Of the reported cases of acute kidney injury, one AE 
was considered as SAE and the remaining AEs as non-serious AEs. As requested, details of all reported 
cases of acute kidney injury during Study GS-US-540-5823 including causality assessments were 
presented. Overall, no safety signal could be identified based on these data. 
Furthermore, safety data from the 3 adolescent patients from Study GS-US-540-9012 with 
confirmed COVID-19 who were at increased risk for disease progression and received 3 doses of RDV 
in an outpatient setting, are regarded as too limited to draw any firm conclusion on the safety profile 
of RDV in this patient population.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The high medical need for an effective agent for treatment of COVID-19 in paediatric patients is 
undisputed. 
Provided efficacy data from study GS-US-540-5823 showed improvements in clinical status of 
children ≥ 28 days and weighing ≥ 3 kg with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, including clinical 
improvement based on the 7-point ordinal scale and the PEWS Scale, discharge from hospital, and 
oxygen usage after treatment with RDV. In particular, high rates of recovery as measured by the 7-
point ordinal scale for clinical status (62.3% by Day 10; 83.0% at the time of the last assessment) and 
hospital discharge (60.4% by Day 10; 83.0% by Day 30) were seen.  
However, due to the single-arm design of the study 5823, the lack of a control arm and as only 
descriptive efficacy data have been presented, efficacy data from study 5823 are of limited value. No 
firm conclusion on efficacy in the intended paediatric indication is possible. 
Exposure of RDV and its metabolites in paediatric patients was higher compared to adult patients, 
however, AUC of the intracellularly formed metabolite GS-441524 was mostly comparable between 
cohorts and only moderately increased compared to data from adult outpatients. No trends were 
identified between PK exposures of either RDV or its metabolites and the reported AEs. Further 
optimisation of the dosing regimen to reduce the high variability in PK parameter seems difficult to 
achieve, given that the proposed dosing scheme already used individual weight-based dosing per kg 
bodyweight. Thus, the higher plasma concentrations in the paediatric population could be acceptable. 
None of the participants was infected with the Delta or Omicron variant, hence it remains unclear, if 
the magnitude of benefit is also applicable to paediatric patients infected with the Delta and Omicron 
variant. However, in vitro data indicate that remdesivir might retain the antiviral activity against these 
two variants.  
Confirmed negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR results (defined as 2 consecutive negative results or a negative 
result at the last available sample for participants who completed or discontinued from the study) on 
Day 2 through Day 10 were seen in 42.1% (8/19) total participants with nasal/OP samples, 21.4% 
(6/28) total participants with NP/OP samples and 22.2% (2/9) total participants with ET aspirates. 
However, different sampling techniques to evaluate viral load were used for the study participants, 
namely nasal swabs, NP swaps and endotracheal (ET) aspirates. In addition, the use of the different 
sampling techniques was not balanced between and within Cohorts. Hence, comparability of viral load 
results between and within cohorts could have been severely impacted by the different sampling 
techniques used. It is impossible to elucidate if the differences observed in viral load are due to the 
age/weight-characteristics, the baseline disease status or due to the different sampling techniques 
used. Furthermore, time to first negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR result with confirmation from nasal/OP, 
NP/OP samples, and ET aspirates were mostly not estimable. Taken together, results of the viral load 
data cannot be considered to draw any firm and meaningful conclusion on the antiviral effect of 
remdesivir in paediatric patients.  Furthermore, due to the lack of a control arm it is not possible to 
conclude on an antiviral effect of remdesivir. 
In addition, the provided efficacy data from study GS-US-540-9012, showed that none of the eight 
enrolled adolescent participant (12 to < 18 years of age) had COVID-19-related hospitalisation or all-
cause death by Day 28, neither in the remdesivir group, nor in the placebo group, which is reassuring. 
However, no difference on viral load between the RDV group and the placebo group have been 
detected.

assessment report  
EMA/789715/2022  
Page 102/105 
 
 
 
Overall, only eight adolescent participants with confirmed COVID-19 who were at increased risk for 
disease progression were enrolled in study GS-US-540-9012, of whom only three adolescent patients 
received remdesivir. Hence, the efficacy and safety dataset in adolescent patients weighing more than 
40 kg and having at least one risk factor for progressing to severe disease is considered too limited to 
draw any meaningful conclusion on the efficacy and safety in this patient population. Furthermore, it 
has been noted that the median weight in adolescents treated in study 9012 was significantly above 40 
kg. Patients treated with remdesivir weighted at least 68 kg. Hence, no efficacy data on patients 
weighing less than 68 kg is available.    
No vaccinated paediatric patients were enrolled in study GS-US-540-5823 or -9012. Hence, it remains 
unclear, if the magnitude of benefit of remdesivir documented in unvaccinated patients is applicable to 
a population comprising vaccinated and/or naturally primed seropositive subjects. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Remdesivir was initially given a ‘conditional marketing authorisation’ in the EU on 3 July 2020 for the 
treatment of COVID-19 in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with pneumonia who require 
supplemental oxygen (oxygen via nasal cannula, non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices, 
IMV or ECMO). Since the first approval, the therapeutic indication was restricted to exclude patients 
with pneumonia who required IMV and ECMO at the start of therapy (December 2020, 
EMEA/H/C/005622/II/0012) and extended to include adult patients who do not require supplemental 
oxygen and who are at increased risk of progression to severe COVID-19 (December 2021, 
EMEA/H/C/005622/II/0016).  
Within this procedure, the extension of indication to paediatric patients with pneumonia who require 
supplemental oxygen (low-flow, high-flow oxygen or non-invasive mechanical ventilation at the start of 
therapy) and to adolescent patients weighing more than 40 kg not requiring supplemental oxygen and 
having at least one risk factor for progressing to severe COVID-19 is evaluated. 
Provided efficacy data from study GS-US-540-5823 showed improvements in clinical status of children 
≥ 28 days and weighing ≥ 3 kg with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, including clinical improvement 
based on the 7-point ordinal scale and the PEWS Scale, discharge from hospitalization, and oxygen 
usage after treatment with RDV. In particular, high rates of recovery as measured by the 7-point 
ordinal scale for clinical status (62.3% by Day 10; 83.0% at the time of the last assessment) and 
hospital discharge (60.4% by Day 10; 83.0% by Day 30) were seen.  
However, due to the single-arm design of the study 5823, the lack of a control arm and as only 
descriptive efficacy data have been presented, efficacy data from study 5823 are of limited value. No 
firm conclusion on efficacy in the intended paediatric indication is possible. However, data are 
considered sufficient to support the proposed paediatric indications. 
Overall, RDV was well tolerated during clinical studies in paediatric patients and the safety data 
reported during study GS-US-540-5823 are comparable to the studies in adults. Overall, no safety 
signal was identified based on the data provided. No factors could be identified which explain 
differences between cohorts and it is concluded that due to the limited number of patients in the 
different cohorts no further conclusion can be drawn. Furthermore, no trends have been identified 
between exposures of remdesivir and its metabolites or SBECD exposure and reported AEs. Further 
optimisation of the dosing regimen to reduce the high variability in PK parameters seems difficult to 
achieve, given that the proposed dosing scheme already used individual weight-based dosing per kg 
bodyweight.

Only 8 adolescents were included in study 9012 and thus results on efficacy and safety are very 
limited. However, the proposed dose has already been approved for adolescents >40 kg in need of 
supplemental oxygen and since the provided exposure in this age group is comparable to adults, there 
is no objection to extension of the outpatient indication to adolescents weighing more than 40 kg. 
Hence, the extension of indication to paediatric patients with pneumonia who require supplemental 
oxygen (low-flow, high-flow oxygen or non-invasive mechanical ventilation) at the start of therapy and 
in adolescent patients weighing more than 40 kg not requiring supplemental oxygen and having at 
least one risk factor for progressing to severe COVID-19 is supported.

Grouped application of two Extensions of indication to include:  
- treatment of paediatric patients (at least 4 weeks of age and weighing at least 3 kg) with pneumonia 
requiring supplemental oxygen (low- or high-flow oxygen) or other non-invasive ventilation at start of 
treatment, based on interim results from Study GS-US-540-5823; a phase 2/3 single-arm, open-label 
study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and 
efficacy of Remdesivir in participants from birth to <18 years of age with COVID-19; 
- treatment of paediatric patients (weighing at least 40 kg) who do not require supplemental oxygen 
and who are at increased risk of progressing to severe COVID 19, based on data from 8 adolescent 
patients who were included in Study GS-US-540-9012, which was initially assessed by the CHMP as 
part of procedure II/16 (Extension of Indication to include treatment of adults). 
As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC are updated. The Package 
Leaflet as well as the instructions for healthcare professionals have been updated accordingly.  In 
addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update the list of local 
representatives in the Package Leaflet. Version 5.0 of the RMP has also been submitted.

The group of variations leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the group of variations, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to 
the Risk Management Plan are recommended. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0060/2021 and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

Brief description of the product 
Chemical class: GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist 
Summary of mode of action: As a long-acting incretin agonist, 
tirzepatide combines the signalling of each receptor resulting in glucose-
dependent increase in insulin secretion, reduced glucagon secretion, 
reduced insulin resistance, and decreased food intake through the 
regulation of appetite. These actions enable improved glycaemic control 
and body weight loss. 
Important information about its composition: Tirzepatide is a GIP and 
GLP-1 receptor agonist. It is a 39-amino-acid synthetic peptide engineered 
from the native GIP sequence modified to bind to both the GIP and GLP-1 
receptors and includes a C20 fatty di-acid moiety. It has a half-life of 
approximately 5 days that makes it suitable for once weekly 
administration. 
See eCTD Module 1.3.1 
Current:    Tirzepatide  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adults  with 
insufficiently controlled T2DM as an adjunct to diet and exercise 
 
as a monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due 
to intolerance or contraindications, and  
in addition to other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes. 
Proposed: Tirzepatide is indicated as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet 
and increased physical activity for chronic weight management, including 
weight loss and weight maintenance, in adults with an initial body mass 
index (BMI) of 
  ≥30 kg/m2 (obesity) or 
  ≥27 kg/m2 to <30kg/m2 (overweight) in the presence of at least 
one weight-related comorbid condition (e.g., hypertension, 
dyslipidaemia, obstructive sleep apnoea, cardiovascular disease, 
prediabetes, or type 2 diabetes mellitus). 
Current:  The starting dose of tirzepatide is 2.5 mg once weekly. After 4 
weeks, increase the dose to 5 mg once  weekly. If needed, dose increases 
can  be  made  in  2.5-mg  increments  after  a  minimum  of  4  weeks  on  the 
current dose.  
The recommended doses are 5, 10, and 15 mg. 
The maximum dose is 15 mg once weekly.

Part II: Safety Specification  
Module SI - Epidemiology of the Indication(s) and Target Population(s)  
SI.1 Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  
SI.1.1 Incidence  
Estimates of incidence rates for chronic diseases like T2DM are not well characterised, 
predominately due to the challenges in distinguishing new (incident) cases from existing 
(prevalent) cases in data sources. In general, the incidence rates of diabetes are 6.9 and 6.8 cases 
per 1000 people in the US and Canada, respectively (PHAC 2011; CDC 2020). Annually, 1.5 
million Americans are diagnosed with diabetes, and T2DM accounts for 90% to 95% of all 
diabetes cases (ADA 2018; CDC 2020). 
Between 2014 and 2015, 5758 children and adolescents (aged 10 to 19 years old) were newly 
diagnosed with T2DM in the US (CDC 2020). In the UK, the incidence of T2DM among patients 
aged 16 years and older in 2014 was about 369 per 100,000 person-years (Zghebi et al. 2017). In 
Sweden, the incidence of T2DM in 2013 was 399 per 100,000 people (Norhammar et al. 2016).  
SI.1.2 Prevalence  
Globally, the prevalence of T2DM is estimated to increase from 2.8% in 2000 to 4.4% in 2030 
(Celik 2018), and 1 in 3 Americans is expected to have T2DM by 2050 (Bhupathiraju and Hu 
2016). About 10% of the US population in 2018 and the Canadian population in 2011 had 
diabetes (PHAC 2011; CDC 2020).  
In Europe, the prevalence of diabetes among adults aged 18 years and older was 9.1% in 2017 
and is estimated to be 10.8% in 2045 (IDF 2017). In the UK, the prevalence of T2DM in 
individuals aged 16 years and older was 5.3% in 2014 (Zghebi et al. 2017). Approximately, 7% 
of German population had T2DM in 2010 (Tamayo et al. 2016).  
SI.1.3 Demographics of the Population in the proposed Indication 
and Risk Factors for the Disease  
In the US, over time, the prevalence of diabetes has increased significantly in all age groups, in 
both sexes, in all race groups, and in all education categories (Bhupathiraju and Hu 2016). The 
2018 prevalence of diagnosed diabetes, with the majority being T2DM, increased with age as 
follows: age 18 to 44 years, 3%; age 45 to 64 years, 14%; and age 65 years and older, 21%, with 
men having higher prevalence rate than women (11% vs. 9.5%) (CDC 2020). 
In Europe, no difference between men and women in diabetes prevalence was observed 
(approximately 19% each) (WHO[WWW]). However, the 2005 prevalence of diabetes among 
men and women in European regions was 13% and 9% in the Northwest, 15% and 12% in the 
South, and 11% and 10% in the East, respectively (Fox et al. 2009). 
Globally, more than 200 million women (aged 20 to 79 years) had diabetes in 2017, which is 
projected to increase to more than 300 million by 2045, and 1 in 3 women with diabetes are of 
 
 
reproductive age (IDF 2018). Between 2007 and 2010, 3.2% of women aged 20 to 44 years old 
had diabetes in the US (Kim et al. 2018). Of the annual deliveries in England and Wales, up to 
5% of women have pre-existing diabetes or gestational diabetes (NICE 2015). 
Among the risk factors for T2DM are overweight and obesity, physically inactive lifestyle, 
prediabetes, gestational diabetes, have a family history of T2DM, aged 45 years or older, and 
African American and Hispanic ethno-racial groups (CDC 2021). 
SI.1.4 Main Existing Treatment Options  
All patients with T2DM should receive standardised self-management education, important 
components of which include nutrition, exercise management, and weight loss, as appropriate 
(i.e., lifestyle changes).  
As currently described in international guidelines, the management of hyperglycaemia for most 
patients with T2DM comprises stepwise increases in treatment when glycaemic control can no 
longer be maintained (Davies et al. 2018; ADA 2021). Metformin should be started with lifestyle 
modification at the time of T2DM diagnosis, unless there are contraindications. Although all the 
additional classes of therapies listed within this section are existing treatment options, the choice 
of additional therapy is individualised based on patient preference, therapeutic goals, and clinical 
characteristics, including but not limited to the presence or absence of CV disease, heart failure, 
or CKD. The following is a list of the more common agents used to treat T2DM:  
Oral antidiabetic agents 
  Biguanides (e.g., metformin) are widely used as a first-line therapy; can promote modest 
weight loss; have a low risk of hypoglycaemia; may have GI side effects; associated with 
a rare risk of lactic acidosis (Lalau 2010) and potential for B12 deficiency and a listed 
contraindication for use includes severe renal failure.  
  Sulphonylureas (e.g., glimepiride, glyburide, glipizide) have a moderate-to-severe risk of 
hypoglycaemia and are associated with weight gain (Garber et al. 2019). 
  Thiazolidinediones (e.g., pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) have a low risk of 
hypoglycaemia; are associated with weight gain and have an increased risk of 
oedema/heart failure. 
  Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (e.g., sitagliptin, saxagliptin, algolipitn, and linagliptin) 
have a low risk of hypoglycaemia; are weight neutral, potential risk of pancreatitis has 
been described (although a causal relationship has not been established) and potential risk 
of heart failure with saxagliptin.  
  Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (e.g., canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, 
empagliflozin, and ertugliflozin) are associated with a low risk of hypoglycaemia and 
weight reduction (Garber et al. 2019); shown a benefit for atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
disease (ASCVD; empagliflozin), heart failure (empagliflozin, dapagliflozin), and 
progression of CKD (canagliflozin); are associated with an increased risk of urinary tract 
and genital infections, risk of volume depletion and hypotension; and are associated with 
a rare risk of ketoacidosis, and bone fractures (canagliflozin). 
 
 
  Oral GLP-1 RA semaglutide has a low risk of hypoglycaemia; is associated with weight 
reduction; has GI side effects; has been associated with a potential increased risk of 
pancreatitis (although a causal relationship has not been established); and based on 
evidence from studies in rodents, a potential risk of MTC cannot be excluded. 
Injectable therapies 
  Glucagon-like peptide-1 RAs (e.g., dulaglutide, exenatide, exenatide once weekly, 
liraglutide, lixisenatide, and semaglutide) are administered via SC injection; have a low 
risk of hypoglycaemia; are associated with weight reduction; shown benefit for ASCVD 
(dulaglutide, liraglutide, and semaglutide); have GI side effects; have been associated 
with a potential increased risk of pancreatitis (although a causal relationship has not been 
established); and based on evidence from studies in rodents, a potential risk of MTC 
cannot be excluded. 
Insulin (human insulin and insulin analogues) is administered via SC injection; is 
universally effective; has a moderate-to-high risk of hypoglycaemia; and can be 
associated with weight gain (Garber et al. 2019).  
 
The consensus report by the American Diabetes Association and European Association for the 
Study of Diabetes recommends metformin as the preferred initial glucose-lowering medication 
for most patients with T2DM. Patients with T2DM and with established CV disease can be 
considered for treatment with GLP-1 RAs or SGLT2 inhibitors to reduce MACE, hospitalisation 
for heart failure, CV death, or CKD progression independent of baseline HbA1c or 
individualised HbA1c target. The updated report also suggests that GLP-1 RA can also be 
considered in patients without established CV disease but with the presence of specific indicators 
of high CV risk to reduce MACE. In addition, SGLT2 inhibitors can be considered in patients 
with T2DM and heart failure, particularly those with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction 
to reduce hospitalisation for heart failure, MACE, and CV death. 
SI.1.5 Natural History of the Indicated Condition in the Population, 
Including Mortality and Morbidity  
Morbidity: Patients with T2DM have a risk for significant morbidity if left untreated, including 
microvascular and macrovascular complications. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of 
T2DM complications (32% prevalence rate and 68% mortality rate) (Bhupathiraju and Hu 2016; 
Einarson et al. 2018). 
In Sweden, about 34% of adults with T2DM had CV disease in 2013 (Norhammar et al. 2016). 
In Europe, 35% of patients with coronary heart disease have diabetes (Gyberg et al. 2015). 
Patients with diabetes are about 3-times more likely to have a stroke than those without diabetes 
(Air and Kissela 2007). Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with numerous negative health 
effects, including increased mortality and risks of comorbidities that are described in 
Section SI.1.6. 
Mortality: Individuals with T2DM are more likely to die prematurely than those without T2DM. 
Diabetes accounts for 10% of deaths in Canada (CDA 2019). In 2016, diabetes was the seventh 
leading cause of death in the US (accounting for 2.9% of all deaths in 2016), with corresponding 
 
 
mortality rate of 24.8 deaths per 100,000 people (27.5 in men and 22.1 in women) (Heron 2018). 
In Europe, almost 700,000 deaths were attributed to T2DM in 2017 among adults aged ≥20 years 
(IDF 2017).  
In Germany, 16% of all deaths in 2010 were attributed to T2DM (Jacobs et al. 2017), with age- 
and gender-standardised all-cause mortality rate about twice as high for adults with T2DM as for 
the general population (18.3 vs. 10.1 deaths per 1000 person-years) (Röckl et al. 2017). 
SI.1.6 Important Co-morbidities  
The important comorbidities that may occur among patients with T2DM are listed in Table SI.1.

SI.2 Chronic Weight Management  
SI.2.1 Incidence  
According to a US study of community-dwelling adults, 7% and 16% of individuals had 
developed obesity at the 1- and 3-year follow-up, respectively (DeJesus et al. 2022).  
In a UK study of children and adolescents aged 7 to 15 years, the 4-year cumulative incidence of 
obesity was higher in children aged 7 to 11 years than 11 to 15 years, 5.0% and 1.4%, 
respectively (Hughes et al. 2011). Similarly, in a Spanish study of children and adolescents aged 
2 to 17 years, children aged 6 to 7 years had the highest incidence rate of obesity among boys 
and girls, 4.9 and 3.9 per 100 person-years, respectively (de Bont et al. 2020). 
SI.2.2 Prevalence  
Data from the US NHANES report that the prevalence of obesity in adults has tripled over the 
past 60 years, with the age-adjusted prevalence increasing from 13.4% in 1960 to 1962, to 42.4% 
in 2017 to 2018 (Fryar et al. 2020; Hales et al. 2020).  
In 2016, the worldwide prevalence of obesity in adults aged at least 18 years was 13%, ranging 
from 4% to 42.4% in various countries. The prevalence of obesity among adults in various 
countries is listed here (IPD 2022).

Nationally representative data in the US demonstrate that childhood obesity is a significant 
concern and continues to increase over time (Skinner et al. 2018). The prevalence of obesity 
among children aged 2 to 19 years has nearly quadrupled over the past 50 years, increasing from 
 
 
 
5.2% in 1971 to 1974, to 19.3% in 2017 to 2018, as per data from the NHANES (Fryar et al. 
2020).   
Worldwide, the prevalence of childhood obesity is on the rise (Skinner et al. 2018; Weihrauch-
Bluher and Wiegand 2018). Age-standardised global prevalence is reported to have increased 
from 0.7% and 0.9% for girls and boys, respectively, in 1975 to 5.6% and 7.8% for girls and 
boys, respectively, in 2016 (Klingelhofer et al. 2021). The literature reports an increase in 
obesity in children under 5 years of age in Vietnam from 1.4% in 1998 to 4.6% in 2010 (Do et al. 
2017). In a review of global increases in childhood obesity from 1980 to 2015, the highest 
increase was reported among children in Saudi Arabia (9.33% and 8.52% increase among girls 
and boys, respectively), followed by the US (7.29% and 7.99% increase among girls and boys, 
respectively) (Klingelhofer et al. 2021). Girls in Egypt, Brazil, and Mexico experienced an 
increase in obesity of 6.76%, 5.70%, and 5.56%, respectively. For boys in Brazil and Canada, the 
increase in obesity prevalence was reported as 7.69% and 6.73%, respectively (Klingelhofer et 
al. 2021). 
SI.2.3 Demographics of the Population in the Indication – Age, 
Gender, Racial and/or Ethnic origin (When Relevant for Assessment 
of Safety and Risk Management) and Risk Factors for the Disease  
Gender 
Overall, the prevalence of obesity is higher in women than men, globally, and this trend is 
consistent across the World Bank regions and World Bank income groups, including low-, 
middle-, and high-income countries (Kanter and Caballero 2012; Cooper et al. 2021). In 2016, 
the global prevalence of obesity was 15% in women and 11% in men (WHO 2021). The results 
from a US survey reported the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity in 2013 to 2014 was higher in 
women (40.4%) than men (35.0%) (Flegal et al. 2016). Although more recent NHANES data 
from 2017 to 2018 did not detect a gender gap in overall obesity prevalence, severe (Class 3) 
obesity was reported to be higher in women than men (11.5% versus 6.9%, respectively) (Hales 
et al. 2020). At a country level, there are some exceptions; for example, in Japan, the prevalence 
of overweight and obesity were 40.3% and 11.2% in men, and 18.6% and 7.1% in women, 
respectively (Hasegawa et al. 2020).  
Age 
Obesity is increasingly prevalent among both the adult and paediatric populations. In 2017 to 
2018, the US prevalence was  
  40.0% among younger adults aged 20 to 39 years 
  44.8% among middle-aged adults aged 40 to 59 years, and  
  42.8% among older adults aged 60 year and above.  
The differences were not significant. Class 3 obesity, however, was significantly different by age 
group with the highest prevalence among adults aged 40 to 59 years (11.5%), followed by adults 
aged 20 to 39 years (9.1%), and adults aged 60 years and above (5.8%) (Hales et al. 2020). The 
 
 
 
US prevalence of paediatric obesity in 2017 to 2020 increased with increasing age. The 
prevalence was 12.7%, 20.7%, and 22.2% in those aged 2 to 5 years, 6 to 11 years, and 12 to 19 
years, respectively (CDC 2022). A sharp increase in obesity has been observed among children 
aged 2 to 5 years, most notable in males whose prevalence increased 40% from 2011 to 2016 
(Skinner et al. 2018).   
Ethnicity 
There are notable disparities in obesity prevalence across ethnic/racial subgroups in the US. 
These disparities appear to be driven by differential sociocultural influences, socioeconomic 
status, health behaviours, neighbourhood environments, and early childhood health factors (Min 
et al. 2021). The highest age-adjusted prevalence of obesity in the US was seen in non-Hispanic 
Blacks (49.9%), followed by Hispanics (45.6%), and non-Hispanic Whites (41.4%) (NCHS 
2021). Similar to adults, the prevalence of obesity in children was highest in Hispanic (26.2%) 
and non-Hispanic Black children (24.8%) (CDC 2022).  
Risk factors 
Per NIH 2022, there are many risk factors for obesity including 
 
lifestyle factors, such as  
o  high calorie-low nutrient foods 
o 
inadequate or poor-quality sleep 
o  no or low physical activity 
o  stress 
o  circadian disruption 
  environmental factors, for example, chemical endocrine disruptors 
  a host of weight gain-promoting medications 
 
  developmental factors, that is, epigenetics.  
family history and genetics, and  
In a study of community-dwelling adults, those who were overweight at baseline had a 
significantly higher risk of developing obesity at the 1- and 3-year follow-ups when compared 
with those who were normal weight. The unadjusted HR was 13.4 (95% CI: 11.48 to 15.49) and 
11.9 (95% CI: 10.87 to 13.14), respectively (DeJesus et al. 2022).  
Childhood obesity is also a significant risk factor for adult obesity (WHO 2021). A systematic 
review and meta-analysis reported that approximately 55% of children with obesity go on to 
have obesity in adolescence. About 80% of adolescents with obesity will still have obesity in 
adulthood and about 70% will have obesity over age 30 years (Simmonds et al. 2016). 
SI.2.4 Main Existing Treatment Options  
Obesity is a treatable disease. Obesity treatment strategies may include nutritional and 
behavioural interventions, pharmacological agents, and/or bariatric (metabolic) surgery. 
For those with established co-morbidities, achieving greater than 10% body weight reduction can 
substantially improve and successfully reverse the course of some conditions. These conditions 
 
 
may include T2DM, obstructive sleep apnoea, gastroesophageal reflux, CV disease outcomes, 
and CV disease risks, such as dyslipidaemia, and hypertension (Gregg et al. 2016; Haase et al. 
2021; Sarma et al. 2021; Sutanto et al. 2021). 
Behavioural and nutritional interventions  
Lifestyle approaches, based on caloric restriction, physical activity, and behavioural therapy, 
yield an average 5% to 10% body weight reduction. This degree of weight reduction has been 
associated with some improvement in obesity-related CV risk factors, and in some cases, 
improved health-related quality of life (Mertens and Van Gaal 2000; Knowler et al. 2002; Jensen 
et al. 2014; Kolotkin and Andersen 2017). However, lifestyle therapies alone fail to achieve 
sustainable weight reduction in most individuals with obesity.   
Caloric restriction through lifestyle change, for example, has been shown to lead to metabolic 
adaptive responses, including increases in hunger hormones, decreases in satiety factors 
(including gastrointestinal peptides), increased appetitive drive and food intake, and lower 
energy expenditure (Leibel et al. 1995; Sumithran et al. 2011). These adaptations are thought to 
work in concert to cause regain and poor durability of treatment such that only 20% of 
individuals can maintain a 10% weight reduction at 1 year with lifestyle-based treatment (Wing 
and Hill 2001).   
Moreover, weight reduction beyond that achieved with lifestyle alone, for example, more than 
10% weight reduction, is often needed for the resolution of obesity-related co-morbidities and 
reduction of CV mortality (Wing et al. 2011).   
Bariatric surgery for managing obesity  
Bariatric (or metabolic) surgery remains an effective option for select people with obesity:  
  BMI at least 30 kg/m2 with uncontrolled T2DM 
  BMI 35 to 39.9 kg/m2 with co-morbidities, and  
  BMI at least 40 kg/m2 irrespective of co-morbidities.  
Individuals who undergo bariatric surgery lose an average of 25% to 30% body weight. Data 
indicate that patients who undergo bariatric surgery have improvements in T2DM, reduced CV 
risk, improvements in health-related quality of life, and decreased risk of death due to CV events 
and cancer (Schauer et al. 2012, 2017; Sjöström et al. 2012). During the COVID-19 pandemic, 
individuals who underwent bariatric surgery were at a lower risk for hospitalisation, need for 
supplemental oxygen, and severe COVID-19 infection than those with obesity who did not 
(Aminian et al. 2022).  
Although bariatric surgery is available for select individuals with obesity, and laparoscopic 
approaches and multidisciplinary care have substantially reduced complication rates over time, 
surgical procedures are still associated with some risk of peri-operative and post-operative 
complications (Opperer et al. 2016; Currie et al. 2021). Due to a combination of lack of 
awareness, limited access, and apprehension regarding the invasive and permanent nature of 
bariatric surgery, less than 1% of the eligible population receives bariatric surgery as a treatment 
 
 
for obesity (ASMBS 2021), resulting in a significant unmet medical need for this patient 
population. 
Current pharmacological agents for treating obesity  
Because there is limited efficacy of lifestyle intervention alone, and substantial efficacy but poor 
scalability of surgical approaches, there is a considerable treatment gap in obesity care that 
pharmacologic innovation has sought to address over the past 30 years. Despite numerous 
efforts, there remains an unmet need in the pharmacologic treatment of obesity for drugs that are 
safe, substantially efficacious, and well tolerated. Current guidance recommends the use of 
approved anti-obesity medications in individuals with BMI at least 30 kg/m2, or at least 27 kg/m2 
with 1 or more weight-related comorbid condition (Apovian et al. 2015). Until recently, anti-
obesity medications used in conjunction with behaviour modifications demonstrated single digit 
average percentage body weight reductions with only a small fraction of individuals maintaining 
greater than 10% weight reduction at tolerable doses.   
The GLP-1 RA class has entered the paradigm as a treatment option for patients with obesity. 
Studies with these agents have demonstrated greater body weight reductions compared with 
other anti-obesity medications, with some GLP-1 RAs achieving a 12.4% change in baseline 
body weight compared with placebo (Wilding et al. 2021). Additionally, GLP-1 RA effects may 
provide beneficial CV risk reduction and improvement in inflammation that make this a 
promising therapeutic class in patients with T2DM, obesity, or both conditions (Ryan et al. 2020; 
Wilding et al. 2021). 
SI.2.5 Natural History of the Indicated Condition in the Untreated 
Population, Including Mortality and Morbidity  
Obesity is a chronic, progressive, and relapsing disease associated with substantial morbidity and 
mortality.  
Morbidity  
Complications of obesity vary and may develop and progress over time. For example, most 
individuals who may be clinically assessed as having “metabolically healthy obesity” eventually 
develop metabolic abnormalities and clinical disease like hypertension and T2DM (Echouffo-
Tcheugui et al. 2019). Obesity-related complications span cardiometabolic, inflammatory, 
degenerative, mechanophysical, neoplastic, and psychological conditions (Wilding and Jacob 
2021). Obesity significantly impacts patients’ daily activities and quality of life (Poon et al. 
2022). 
Most individuals with obesity engage in multiple attempts in weight reduction throughout the 
course of their disease. Data from 2013 to 2016 NHANES indicated that 49.1% of US adults 
tried to lose weight just within the past 12 months (Martin et al. 2018). As lifestyle-based 
strategies infrequently lead to durable weight reduction, many people regain weight after each 
attempt leading to weight cycling. Although the effects of weight cycling on health outcomes are 
a source of debate, repeated dieting and weight cycling have been implicated in an increased risk 
 
 
for eating disorders, other psychological disorders, and multiple co-morbidities including T2DM, 
hypertension, cancer, bone fractures, and increased mortality (Rhee 2017).  
Mortality  
Obesity has been associated with significantly higher all-cause mortality when compared with 
normal weight (BMI of 18.5 to less than 25 kg/m2), HR 1.18 (95% CI: 1.12 to 1.25) (Flegal et al. 
2013). In 2015, excess body weight accounted for approximately 4 million deaths and 120 
million disability-adjusted life-years worldwide (The GBD 2015 Obesity Collaborators 2017). 
Secondary to the emergence of multisystem comorbid disease, obesity shortens life expectancy 
by 3 years, with Class 3 obesity decreasing life expectancy by up to 20 years (OECD 2019; 
Müller et al. 2021).  
Childhood obesity  
Childhood obesity is associated with a higher chance of obesity, premature death, and disability 
in adulthood. In addition to these increased future risks, children with obesity experience 
breathing difficulties, increased risk of fractures, hypertension, early markers of CV disease, 
insulin resistance, and psychological effects (WHO 2021). 
SI.2.6 Important Co-morbidities  
Obesity has been associated with increased risk of multiple conditions (Müller et al. 2021), 
including  
  atherosclerotic CV disease, including coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and 
stroke 
  heart failure 
  arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation 
  T2DM 
  non-alcoholic steatohepatitis 
  depression 
  obstructive sleep apnoea 
  osteoarthritis, and 
  13 types of cancers. 
Recently, studies indicated that individuals with obesity were more likely to be hospitalised, 
require mechanical ventilation, and die from COVID-19 than those without obesity (Foo et al. 
2021; Gao et al. 2021; Smati et al. 2021). 
 
 
 
 
 
Module SII – Nonclinical Part of the Safety Specification  
SII.1 Toxicity  
Thyroid safety  
  Consistent with the long-acting medicinal products in the GLP-1 RA class, an increased 
incidence of thyroid C-cell adenomas and carcinomas occurred in all tirzepatide-treated 
groups in a rat carcinogenicity study. No changes in thyroid C-cells were observed in 
monkey studies with tirzepatide which is also consistent with the lack of effect in 
monkeys for other GLP-1 RAs (Bjerre Knudsen et al. 2010; Vahle et al. 2015). The 
relevance of rodent thyroid tumours to humans is not known.  
Reproductive and developmental safety 
 
 
In a female fertility study in rats, oestrous cycles were disrupted and numbers of corpora 
lutea were decreased in all tirzepatide-treated groups. These effects were considered 
secondary to the decreased body weight and food consumption noted at all dose levels. 
Although corpora lutea formation was decreased, there were no effects on mating, 
fertility, conception, or embryonic survival in any treated group.  
In pregnant rats and rabbits that were given tirzepatide, developmental effects occurred 
only in conjunction with maternal toxicity and included  
reduced foetal weights in both species, and  
increased numbers of malformations and developmental variations in rats. 
o 
o 
 
In a male fertility study in rats, there were no effects on mating, fertility, sperm analysis, 
or reproduction. 
SII.2 Safety Pharmacology  
Cardiovascular safety  
In the single-dose safety pharmacology study in monkeys, tirzepatide effects were consistent 
with incretin pharmacology and consisted of  
increased heart rate 
increased diastolic blood pressure 
increased mean arterial pressure, and  
 
 
 
  decreased dP/dtmax (rate derivative for change in ventricular pressure over time; index of 
cardiac contractility).  
Given the observed effect on heart rate and blood pressure, changes in dP/dtmax would be 
expected. There were no effects on corrected QT interval.  
SII.3 Other Toxicity-Related Information or Data  
Tirzepatide-related changes in both rat and monkey repeat-dose toxicity studies up to 6 months 
in duration, were generally consistent with, or secondary to, incretin pharmacology. The primary 
effects of tirzepatide administration to rats were dose-dependent decrease in food consumption 
 
 
 
and decrease in body weight gain or body weight loss or both. None of these effects were 
considered adverse to the health of the animals and no dose-limiting target organ toxicity was 
observed.

Module SIV - Populations Not Studied in Clinical Trials  
SIV.1 Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Studies within the Development 
Programme  
The important exclusion criteria in the pivotal clinical studies are summarised in the table below. 
Criterion 
Missing  
Information 
(Yes or No) 
Patients <18 years 
of age 
No 
Reason and Rationale for Exclusion 
 
 
 
 
The safety and efficacy of tirzepatide in children aged less than 18 
years has not yet been established. 
Paediatric clinical trials for T2DM are under development. 
The prevalence of T2DM in the paediatric population is low and 
currently liraglutide is the only GLP-1 RA approved for paediatric 
patients aged 10 to 17 years old. 
Paediatric clinical trials are under development for 
obesity.Currently, liraglutide is the only GLP-1 RA approved for 
paediatric participants aged 12 to 17 years with obesity. 
Women who are 
pregnant or 
breastfeeding 
No 
Patients with renal 
impairment 
No 
 
 
  No adequate and well-controlled studies of tirzepatide have been 
conducted in pregnant or nursing women. Therefore, there is a 
limited amount of data from the use of tirzepatide in pregnant 
women and women who are breastfeeding.  
Insufficient data on the effects of tirzepatide on maternal health and 
foetus prohibited the inclusion of pregnant women in the Phase 2 
and Phase 3 registration trials.  
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity. In pregnant 
rats and rabbits that were given tirzepatide, developmental effects, 
like reduced foetal weights, were observed in both species. 
Increased numbers of malformations and developmental variations 
in rats occurred only in conjunction with maternal toxicity. 
Severe CKD with associated comorbidities or concomitant 
medications might represent an important confounder in clinical 
trials. 
The molecular weight of tirzepatide is 4.8 kDa, which while greater 
than that of non-biologic drugs, is still notably lower than the 
glomerular filtration cutoff of 30 to 50 kDa; hence, the impact of 
renal impairment on tirzepatide PK cannot be disregarded. 
However, tirzepatide is presumed to be degraded into component 
amino acids by protein catabolism pathways. 
 
 
  Many trials used metformin as a comparator or as background 
 
therapy. Metformin is contraindicated for patients with a higher 
severity of renal disease. 
The available PK data (I8F-MC-GPGG) confirm that there is no 
accumulation of tirzepatide in patients with renal impairment. For 
this reason, no dosage adjustment is required in these patients. 
Additionally, in the Phase 3 T2DM and CWM programmes, there 
are limited amount of data from the use of tirzepatide in severe 
CKD (eGFR <30mL/min/1.73m2 by CKD-EPI).

Reason and Rationale for Exclusion 
 
Patients with 
hepatic 
impairment 
Severe hepatic disease with associated comorbidities/concomitant 
medications might represent an important confounder in clinical 
trials. However, NAFLD/NASH is a common co-morbidity in 
participants with obesity or T2DM, and participants with 
NAFLD/NASH were not excluded from the clinical development 
programmes. 
Tirzepatide is presumed to be degraded into component amino 
acids by protein catabolism pathways. It is a synthetic peptide, and, 
hence, not expected to be bio-transformed by drug-metabolising 
enzymes. 
The available PK data (I8F-MC-GPGQ) confirm that there are no 
clinically relevant effects of hepatic impairment on PK of 
tirzepatide. For this reason, no dosage adjustment is required in 
these patients.

SIV.2 Limitations to Detect Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trial Development 
Programmes  
The clinical development programme is unlikely to detect certain types of adverse reactions such 
as rare adverse reactions, adverse reactions with a long latency, or those caused by prolonged 
exposure. However, an estimated cumulative exposure of 18,143 participants in the tirzepatide 
clinical trial program and approximately 15,000 participants in the planned studies with an 
exposure duration of 3 to 5 years increases the ability to detect rare and cumulative effects of the 
drug.

Pregnant and breastfeeding women were excluded at screening in 
the clinical trials due to the considerations described in 
Section SIV.1. 
During the tirzepatide clinical trial programme for T2DM and 
CWM, (regardless of BMI at study entry), 25 pregnancies (0.56%) 
were reported in tirzepatide-treated female participants. 
Additionally, 4 pregnancies were reported in the partner of male 
study participants.  
During the tirzepatide clinical trial programme, no cases of 
breastfeeding were reported. 
In a completed clinical pharmacology study, I8F-MC-GPGQ, 
evaluating the PK and tolerability of a single 5-mg dose of 
tirzepatide, a total of 32 subjects were enrolled. Of these, 19 
subjects were with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment:

 
Out of 7702 patients enrolled in the Phase 3 programme of T2DM 
and CWM (regardless of BMI at study entry), the number of 
tirzepatide-treated patients with renal impairment is as follows:  
16 with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 
mL/minute/1.73m2) 
476 with moderate renal impairment (eGFR >30 to <60

In a completed Phase 3 study, I8F-MC-GPGM, evaluating the safety 
and efficacy of tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg and/or 15 mg in patients 
with T2DM and increased CV risk (coronary heart disease, 
peripheral arterial disease, cerebrovascular disease, CKD if >50 
years old, congestive heart failure if >50 years old), a total of 2002 
patients were enrolled.  
A Phase 3 study (I8F-MC-GPGN) is ongoing to assess the efficacy 
of maximally tolerated tirzepatide dose up to 15 mg in patients with 
T2DM with established CV disease and elevated risk for MACE. 
Immunocompromised patients  
Patients with a disease severity different 
from inclusion criteria in clinical trials 
A Phase 3 Study 18F-MC-GPIJ is ongoing to investigate the 
reduction of morbidity and mortality with once-weekly tirzepatide 
treatment compared with placebo in adult participants living with 
obesity and established CV disease or CV risk factors, excluding 
diabetes. 
Tirzepatide has not been specifically studied in 
immunocompromised patients. 
The clinical development programme included a representative 
population of: 
 
patients with different degrees of T2DM severity defined by 
inclusion criteria, such as baseline HbA1c, duration of diabetes, 
and use of other diabetes medications. 
patients with different degrees of overweight/obesity defined by 
BMI criteria.  
 
Population with relevant different ethnic 
origin 
Subpopulations carrying relevant genetic 
polymorphisms 
Other  
Patients with diabetes and overweight/obesity from different racial 
and ethnic backgrounds were included in the tirzepatide clinical 
development programme. The number of patients and exposure time 
are shown in Table SIII.7.to Table SIII.10. 
In the CWM clinical trials, those with known or suspected 
monogenetic or syndromic obesity were excluded. 
However, a study is under development to investigate the 
relationship between response to tirzepatide in the CWM trials and 
genetic variants thought to play a role in obesity.

SVII.1.2 Risks Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of 
Safety Concerns in the RMP  
Important Identified Risk: None  
Risk-Benefit Impact: 
Not applicable.  
 
 
Important Potential Risk 1: Medullary thyroid cancer 
Risk-Benefit Impact 
Medullary thyroid cancer is a rare cancer that accounts for 2% to 4% of all thyroid cancers, with 
a 5-year survival of 80%. It may result in associated costs with hospitalisation, surgery, and 
morbidity (Schmid et al. 2015). 
In nonclinical studies, thyroid C-cell tumours have been reported in rodents treated with some 
long-acting GLP-1 RAs. Treatment-related increases in thyroid C-cell hyperplasia and neoplasia 
were observed with tirzepatide, at all doses, in a 2-year rat carcinogenicity study. The relevance 
of rodent thyroid tumours to humans is not known. Nonclinical experience supports that the 
rodent thyroid C-cells are more sensitive to the effects of GLP-1 agonists than monkey thyroid 
C-cells. Clinical data have not demonstrated an apparent effect of GLP-1 agonists on C-cells in 
humans, and no cases of MTC or other C-cell disease have been reported in the completed 
tirzepatide clinical trial programme. 
Neither a pharmacologically plausible mechanism linking the rodent findings to humans nor a 
causal relationship between tirzepatide and thyroid C-cell tumours has been established. At this 
time, there is insufficient evidence to attribute human thyroid C-cell disease to tirzepatide. Given 
the latency for cancer, the database for tirzepatide is of insufficient size and exposure duration to 
assess definitively for risk of any particular type of cancer. 
MTC, if established, would impact the benefit/risk ratio of tirzepatide due to the medically 
important condition. To evaluate the potential association, a medullary thyroid carcinoma 
surveillance study (PASS Category 3) is planned to systematically monitor the annual incidence 
of medullary thyroid carcinoma as well as to identify any increase related to tirzepatide. This 
study is an additional pharmacovigilance activity and will be conducted similar to studies with 
other long-acting medicinal products in the GLP-1 RA class (Part III.2). 
Important Potential Risk 2: Pancreatic malignancy 
Risk-benefit impact: 
Pancreatic cancer is a rare cancer with a low rate of survival. Should a causal association be 
determined between tirzepatide and pancreatic carcinoma, the benefit versus risk ratio would be 
reduced. 
Nonclinical data for tirzepatide did not suggest any mutagenicity or genotoxicity. The 
nonclinical data were generally similar to the data for marketed GLP-1 RAs and did not identify 
any evidence of pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer. Promotion of tumours by long-acting GLP-1 
RAs has been proposed as a concern for these treatments because of their action to chronically 
stimulate GLP-1 receptors, particularly in thyroid C-cells and the pancreas (Bjerre Knudsen et al. 
2010; Butler et al. 2010). 
In the completed Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies for tirzepatide, the incidence and 
exposure-adjusted incidence (defined as number of patients with events/observation time 
[person-years] × 100) of pancreatic malignancy are low: 0.04% and 0.04 patients/100 
 
 
person-years, respectively, for T2DM, and 0.02% and 0.02 patients/100 person-years, 
respectively, for CWM.  
There is no evidence from clinical trials that GLP-1-based therapies increase the risk of 
pancreatic cancer, although causality is suspected for the long-acting GLP-1 RAs from 
nonclinical studies. Given the latency for cancer, the database for tirzepatide is of insufficient 
size and exposure duration to assess definitively for risk of any particular type of cancer, 
especially for slow developing pancreatic cancer.  
Pancreatic malignancy, if established, would impact the benefit/risk ratio of tirzepatide due to the 
clinical importance of pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer develops slowly, and the currently 
available data do not allow for the assessment of the association with tirzepatide. To confirm or 
refute this association, a pancreatic malignancy surveillance study (PASS Category 3) is planned 
to systematically monitor the annual incidence as well as to identify any increase related to 
tirzepatide (Part III.2). 
Important Potential Risk 3: Diabetic retinopathy complications 
Risk-benefit impact: 
Tirzepatide provides clinically meaningful improvement in glycaemic control, which is 
beneficial in reducing the risk of DR complications. However, it has been suggested that rapid 
glycaemic improvement may lead to temporary worsening of DR and associated complications. 
Patients with a history of proliferative DR, diabetic maculopathy, or non-proliferative DR 
planned treatment were excluded from the tirzepatide clinical trial development programme. The 
current tirzepatide clinical trial data do not support a causal association with DR complications. 
Per clinical trial data, the incidence and exposure-adjusted incidence (defined as number 
of patients with events/total observation time [person-years] × 100) of DR in completed clinical 
trials for tirzepatide are low: 0.35% and 0.33 patients/100 person-years, respectively. 
DR complications, if established, would impact the benefit/risk ratio of tirzepatide due to the 
medically important condition of DR complications. However, the currently available data do not 
allow for the evaluation of the association since patients with a history of DR complications were 
excluded from the tirzepatide clinical trial development programme. To confirm or refute this 
association, the risk of disease progression for DR among patients treated with tirzepatide is 
being further assessed in an ongoing addendum study, Protocol addendum I8F-MC-GPGN 
(GPGN) (7) (Part III.2). 
 
 
Missing Information: Use in pregnancy and lactation 
Risk-benefit impact: 
Tirzepatide has not been tested in pregnant and breastfeeding women. There are no plans to 
include pregnant or breastfeeding women in future trials. Studies in animals have shown that 
developmental effects (reduced foetal weights and increased numbers of malformations and 
developmental variations) occurred in conjunction with pharmacological effects on maternal 
weight and food consumption. Therefore, the use of tirzepatide is not recommended during 
pregnancy.  
It is unknown whether tirzepatide is excreted in breast milk. A risk to new-borns or infants 
cannot be excluded. Tirzepatide should be used with caution during breastfeeding. 
At present, the impact on the benefit-risk balance of tirzepatide is unknown.

and Missing Information  
SVII.3.1 Presentation of Important Identified Risks and Important 
Potential Risks   
Important Identified Risk: None  
Important Potential Risk: Medullary thyroid cancer  
Potential mechanisms 
No causal relationship has been established between GLP-1 RA administration and MTC in 
humans. Evidence linking MTC to treatment with tirzepatide and other products in the 
incretin-based therapies is entirely from nonclinical studies. Expression levels of GLP-1 receptor 
on thyroid C-cells differs across species, with rats having high expression levels, while humans 
and cynomolgus monkeys have low expression levels. Receptor expression in rats and mouse 
thyroid glands show a density that is 22- and 45-fold higher than that reported for humans and 
cynomolgus monkeys, respectively (Bjerre Knudsen et al. 2010; Waser et al. 2011). 
Furthermore, rats have been shown to be more sensitive to the effects of GLP-1 RAs than 
monkeys (Bjerre Knudsen et al. 2010; Vahle et al. 2015). Thus, the weight of evidence suggests 
that the observation in rodents might not have relevance in humans. 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence: 
In nonclinical studies, treatment-related increases in thyroid C-cell hyperplasia and neoplasia 
were observed with tirzepatide, at all doses, in a 2-year rat carcinogenicity study. The relevance 
of rodent thyroid tumours to humans is not known. This effect on rodent thyroids has been 
observed consistently with other long-acting GLP-1 RAs, including liraglutide, exenatide once 
 
 
weekly, dulaglutide, and semaglutide, in near-lifetime exposure carcinogenicity studies. The 
relevance to humans cannot be determined from clinical and nonclinical studies. At this time, 
there is insufficient evidence to attribute thyroid C-cell disease to tirzepatide. Given the latency 
for cancer, the database for tirzepatide is of insufficient size and exposure duration to assess 
definitively for risk of any particular type of cancer. 
Characterisation of the risk: 
Nonclinical data suggest that this safety concern is a key safety finding. However, there were no 
cases of MTC, or other C-cell disease reported in the completed tirzepatide clinical trial 
programme. 
Risk factors and risk groups: 
Medullary thyroid carcinoma develops from C (parafollicular) cells and accounts for 5% to 10% 
of all thyroid cancers (Brady 2018), and up to 25% of MTC cases develop under multiple 
endocrine neoplasia-2A (IARC 2018). Compared to the general population (6.6%), patients with 
diabetes have a higher prevalence of thyroid disorders (10.8%) (Shih et al. 2012). However, the 
link between T2DM and thyroid cancer is arguable. Some studies did not show an association 
between diabetes, including T2DM and thyroid cancer risk (Kitahara et al. 2012; Shih et al. 
2012; Seo et al. 2017). Other studies showed that patients with diabetes are 20% to 34% more 
likely to develop thyroid cancer compared to those without diabetes (Yeo et al. 2014; Li and 
Qian 2017). 
Studies show that the risk of thyroid cancer, specifically papillary thyroid cancer, increased in 
participants with overweight and obesity compared with normal-weight participants. It has been 
estimated that a 5-point increase in BMI and a 0.1-point increase in waist-to-hip ratio increase 
the risk of thyroid cancer by 30% and 14%, respectively (Schmid et al. 2015, Kitahara et al. 
2020, Li et al. 2020). Although there is a positive association between obesity/overweight and 
papillary, follicular, and anaplastic thyroid cancers, there was an inverse association noted with 
MTC (Schmid et al. 2015).  
Preventability:The only known risk factors are genetic in nature. In the US, GLP-1 RAs are 
contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or multiple endocrine 
neoplasia type 2. It is unknown if this precautionary measure prevents MTC from developing in 
patients with a family history of MTC or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2. (Schmid et al. 
2015). 
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product: 
In general, thyroid cancer is a rare condition. Medullary thyroid cancer is a rare cancer that 
accounts for 2% to 4% of all thyroid cancers, with a 5-year survival of 80%. It may result in 
associated costs with hospitalisation, surgery, and morbidity (Schmid et al. 2015). 
In nonclinical studies, thyroid C-cell tumours have been reported in rodents treated with some 
long-acting GLP-1 RAs. Treatment-related increases in thyroid C-cell hyperplasia and neoplasia 
were observed with tirzepatide, at all doses, in a 2-year rat carcinogenicity study. The relevance 
 
 
of rodent thyroid tumours to humans is not known. Nonclinical experience supports that the 
rodent thyroid C-cells are more sensitive to the effects of GLP-1 agonists than monkey thyroid 
C-cells. Clinical data have not demonstrated an apparent effect of GLP-1 agonists on C-cells in 
humans, and no cases of MTC or other C-cell disease reported in the tirzepatide clinical trial 
programme. 
Neither a pharmacologically plausible mechanism linking the rodent findings to humans nor a 
causal relationship between tirzepatide and thyroid C-cell tumours has been established. At this 
time, there is insufficient evidence to attribute human thyroid C-cell disease to tirzepatide. Given 
the latency for cancer, the database for tirzepatide is of insufficient size and exposure duration to 
assess definitively for any particular type of cancer. 
MTC, if established, would impact the benefit/risk ratio of tirzepatide due to the medically 
important condition. To evaluate the potential association, a medullary thyroid carcinoma 
surveillance study (PASS Category 3) is planned to systematically monitor the annual incidence 
of medullary thyroid carcinoma as well as to identify any increase related to tirzepatide. This 
study is an additional pharmacovigilance activity and will be conducted similar to studies with 
other long-acting medicinal products in the GLP-1 RA class (Part III.2). 
Public health impact: 
There were no cases of MTC, or other C-cell disease reported in the completed tirzepatide 
clinical trial programme. A link between treatment with tirzepatide and the occurrence of MTC 
has not been established in humans.  
Based on the assumption that only a pre-existent MTC might be stimulated to grow by a GLP-1 
RA, then, even a confirmed link between GLP-1 RA and this rare thyroid tumour would have 
very limited impact on public health. 
Important Potential Risk: Pancreatic malignancy 
Potential mechanisms: 
Nonclinical data for tirzepatide did not suggest any mutagenicity or genotoxicity and were 
generally similar to marketed GLP-1 RAs and did not identify evidence of pancreatitis or 
pancreatic cancer. Promotion of tumours by long-acting GLP-1 RAs has been proposed as a 
concern for these treatments because of their action to chronically stimulate GLP-1 receptors, 
particularly in thyroid C-cells and the pancreas (Bjerre Knudsen et al. 2010; Butler et al. 2010). 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence: 
There is no evidence from clinical trials that GLP-1-based therapies increase the risk of 
pancreatic cancer. Some reports indicate a causal association with these agents, while others 
have failed to show such an association. A joint US Food and Drug Administration and EMA 
publication states that, data demonstrate conflicting opinions about the strength of the association 
(Egan et al. 2014).  
To date, no causal relationship between tirzepatide and pancreatic malignancy has been 
established. From the Phase 2 and 3 clinical trial programmes for tirzepatide, a few cases of 
 
 
pancreatic malignancy were reported. There were 4 cases of pancreatic cancer, of which 2 were 
from tirzepatide groups and 2 from placebo group. 
Characterisation of the risk:

Risk factors and risk groups:  
Patients with long-standing T2DM are twice more likely to have pancreatic cancer than patients 
without T2DM. About 0.5% of patients who were newly diagnosed with T2DM develop 
pancreatic cancer within 6 years of follow-up (Yadav and Lowenfels 2013).  
Obesity increases the risk of pancreatic cancer, with approximate 10% or greater increases in risk 
of pancreatic cancer for a 5 kg/m2 unit increase in BMI, or a 20% to 50% increased risk among 
those with obesity relative to participants with normal BMI (Berrington et al. 2003; Larsson et al. 
2007; Renehan et al. 2008). 
Being the fourth leading cause of cancer mortality, pancreatic cancer is a highly mortal 
malignancy with 75% of patients dying within the first year of diagnosis (Bracci 2012). The 5-
year survival rate among patients with pancreatic malignancy is about 6% (Yadav and Lowenfels 
2013).  
Preventability: 
The risk of pancreatic malignancy cannot be mitigated sufficiently. Symptoms and signs, once 
present, often relate to advanced disease (McAuliffe and Christein 2013). Among the major risk 
factors associated with pancreatic malignancy, about 66% are potentially modifiable, including 
smoking cessation, limiting alcohol consumption, and adopting healthy diet and lifestyle. These 
behaviours could reduce pancreatic malignancy risk by 30% (Maisonneuve and Lowenfels 
2018). 
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product: 
Pancreatic cancer is a rare cancer with a low rate of survival. It may reduce the benefit versus 
risk ratio. 
Nonclinical data for tirzepatide did not suggest any mutagenicity or genotoxicity. The 
nonclinical data were generally similar to the data for marketed GLP-1 RAs and did not identify 
any evidence of pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer. Promotion of tumours by long-acting GLP-1 
RAs has been proposed as a concern for these treatments because of their action to chronically 
stimulate GLP-1 receptors, particularly in thyroid C-cells and the pancreas (Bjerre Knudsen et al. 
2010; Butler et al. 2010). 
 
 
In the completed Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies for tirzepatide, the incidence and exposure-
adjusted incidence (defined as number of patients with events/observation time [person-years] × 
100) of pancreatic malignancy in completed clinical trials for tirzepatide are low: 0.04%, 0.04 
patients/100 person-years respectively. 
There is no evidence from clinical trials that GLP-1-based therapies increase the risk of 
pancreatic cancer, although causality is suspected for the long-acting GLP-1 RAs in nonclinical 
studies. Given the latency for cancer, the database for tirzepatide is of insufficient size and 
exposure duration to assess definitively for any particular type of cancer, especially for slow 
developing pancreatic cancer. 
Pancreatic malignancy, if established, would impact the benefit/risk ratio of tirzepatide due to the 
clinical importance of pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer develops slowly, and the currently 
available data do not allow for the assessment of this association with tirzepatide. To confirm or 
refute this association, a pancreatic malignancy surveillance study (PASS Category 3) is planned 
to systematically monitor the annual incidence as well as to identify any increase related to 
tirzepatide (Part III.2). 
Public health impact: 
Given the very low incidence of pancreatic cancers observed in patients treated with tirzepatide 
and the uncertainties regarding a causal association, the public health impact is considered to be 
negligible at this time. 
Important Potential Risk: Diabetic retinopathy complications 
Potential mechanisms: 
DR is a microvascular complication of diabetes caused by damage to the retinal blood vessels. 
Control of blood glucose level has been shown to reduce the risk of new onset DR and slow the 
long-term progression of existing DR (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Group 1993; 
UKPDS 1998). Rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with an early and 
temporary worsening of DR in patients with diabetes (Lauritzen 1983, 1985; Diabetes Control 
and Complications Trial Research Group 1998; Shurter et al. 2013; Fullerton et al. 2014; Bain et 
al. 2019). Intensive glycaemic control and fast robust blood glucose reduction on GLP-1 receptor 
agonists and potentially on tirzepatide, similar to insulins, could result in faster progression of 
DR in the initial phase of the treatment in patients with proliferative DR, macular oedema, or 
both.  
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence: 
Worldwide, the prevalence of DR ranges between 10% and 61% (median 28%) among patients 
with T2DM and between 1.5% and 31% (median 11%) among those newly diagnosed with 
T2DM (Ruta et al. 2013). The incidence rates of DR among adults aged 30 years and older with 
T2DM in the UK and Spain were 11.6 and 81.3 per 1000 people, respectively (Thomas et al. 
2012; Romero-Aroca et al. 2017).  
 
 
 
Deterioration of DR among patients with improved glycaemic control is documented with 
limited information for patients with T2DM specifically (Hooymans et al. 1982; Yau et al. 2012; 
Bain et al. 2019). A study conducted by Oslo Study Group-Brinchmann-Hansen et al. reported 
worsening of DR after introduction of stringent diabetes management within 3 months of 
treatment; approximately 50% of treated patients were affected compared with none of the 
patients treated conventionally (Oslo Study Group et al. 1985). A study conducted among 
patients with type 2 diabetes reported that the risk of progression of DR after 3 and 9 years was 
15.8% and 23%, respectively, for patients treated with intensive therapy compared with 15.3% 
and 27.8%, respectively, for patients undergoing treatment with either insulin or a sulphonylurea 
(Bain et al. 2019). A meta-analysis of 4 randomised controlled trials reported that after 5 years of 
follow-up, more intensive glucose control was associated with a 13% reduction of eye events 
(risk ratio: 0.87; 95% confidence interval: 0.76, 1.00; p = 0.04; Feldman-Billard et al. 2018). 
Patients with a history of proliferative DR, diabetic maculopathy, or non-proliferative DR that 
required acute treatment were excluded from the tirzepatide clinical trial development 
programme. A dedicated retinopathy addendum to SURPASS-CVOT I8F-MC-GPGN is 
ongoing, which will further investigate the risk of disease progression for DR among patients 
treated with tirzepatide. The comparative analysis of the worsening of an existing DR with other 
diabetic treatment to tirzepatide treatment will be conducted after the addendum GPGN 
sub-study results are available. 
Therefore, there was limited experience to determine whether the safety profile in this patient 
population is different from that expected in the population without DR. In Phase 3 clinical trials, 
a dilated fundoscopic examination was performed at baseline and when clinically indicated by 
any suspected adverse event of worsening retinopathy or clinically recommended during the 
course of the study. Incidence rate for patients with DR complications was 0.35%.  
Characterisation of the risk: 
Data source: Completed Phase 3 studies (all tirzepatide doses) 
Incidence*: 0.35% (18 patients out of 5119 tirzepatide-treated patients)  
 
  Exposure-adjusted incidencea: 0.33 patients/100 person-years (total observation time: 
5441.76 person-years) 
* Incidence rate is calculated as the number of patients with DR complications (onset or worsening) recorded on the retinopathy electronic case 
report form/number of subjects in Phase 3 Dose Effect Analysis Set. 
a Exposure-adjusted incidence is calculated as n/total observation time [person-years] × 100, where n = number of patients with events. 
Risk factors and risk groups:  
Patients with T2DM are at a risk of developing microvascular complications, including DR, 
nephropathy, and neuropathy. Rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with an 
early and temporary worsening of DR in patients with diabetes (Lauritzen 1983, 1985; Diabetes 
Control and Complications Trial Research Group 1998; Shurter et al. 2013; Fullerton et al. 2014; 
Bain et al. 2019). 
 
 
Modifiable risk factors for DR include high blood glucose, high blood pressure, high serum 
lipids, and smoking. Non-modifiable risk factors include diabetes duration, age, race, and genetic 
predisposition (Ding and Wong 2012; Scanlon et al. 2013). 
Preventability: 
Long-term control of blood glucose has been shown to reduce the risk of new onset DR and slow 
the progression of existing DR. In addition to the long-term glucose control, it is important for 
patients to attend their annual diabetic appointment, as this can be an opportunity to detect early 
signs of eye problems. 
Early detection of retinopathy increases the chances of the treatment being effective and 
preventing it from getting worse (NHS 2021). Patients should have their eyes examined regularly 
and inform their doctor of any changes in their eyesight. 
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product: 
Tirzepatide provides clinically meaningful improvement in glycaemic control, which is 
beneficial in reducing the risk of DR complications. However, it has been suggested that rapid 
glycaemic improvement may lead to temporary worsening of DR and associated complications. 
Patients with a history of proliferative DR, diabetic maculopathy, or non-proliferative DR with 
planned treatment were excluded from the tirzepatide clinical trial development programme. The 
current tirzepatide clinical trial data do not support a causal association with DR complications. 
Per clinical trial data, the incidence and exposure-adjusted incidence (defined as number 
of patients with events/total observation time [person-years] × 100) of DR in completed clinical 
trials for tirzepatide are low: 0.35% and 0.33 patients/100 person-years, respectively. 
DR complications, if established, would impact the benefit/risk ratio of tirzepatide due to the 
medically important condition of DR complications. However, the currently available data do not 
allow for the evaluation of this association since patients with a history of DR complications 
were excluded from the tirzepatide clinical trial development programme. To confirm or refute 
this association, the risk of disease progression for DR among patients treated with tirzepatide is 
being further assessed in an ongoing addendum study, Protocol addendum I8F-MC-GPGN (7) 
(Part III.2). 
Public health impact: 
Given the low incidence of DR outcome observed in patients treated with tirzepatide, the public 
health impact is considered low at this time.  
 
 
SVII.3.2 Presentation of the Missing Information  
Missing Information: Use in pregnancy and lactation 
Evidence source:  
Consistent with the standard practice in clinical development, pregnant women, breastfeeding 
women, or both were excluded from the clinical trial development programme. Hence, there 
were only limited data on the use of tirzepatide in pregnant women, breastfeeding women, or 
both. During the tirzepatide clinical trial programme, 0.13% of women exposed to tirzepatide 
became pregnant.  
Anticipated risk/consequence of the missing information:  
Tirzepatide has not been tested in pregnant and breastfeeding women. There are no plans to 
include pregnant or breastfeeding women in future trials. Studies in animals have shown that 
developmental effects (reduced foetal weights and increased numbers of malformations and 
developmental variations) occurred in conjunction with pharmacological effects on maternal 
weight and food consumption. Therefore, the use of tirzepatide is not recommended during 
pregnancy.  
It is unknown whether tirzepatide is excreted in breast milk. A risk to newborns or infants 
cannot be excluded. Tirzepatide should be used with caution during breastfeeding.

Part VI: Summary of the Risk Management Plan  
Summary of Risk Management Plan for Mounjaro (Tirzepatide)  
This is a summary of the RMP for Mounjaro. The RMP details important risks of Mounjaro, how 
these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about Mounjaro’s risks 
and uncertainties (missing information). 
Mounjaro’s SmPC and its package leaflet give essential information to healthcare professionals 
and patients on how Mounjaro should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Mounjaro should be read in the context of all this information, 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all of which is 
part of the EPAR.  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Mounjaro’s 
RMP. 
I - The Medicine and What It is Used for  
Mounjaro is authorised for T2DM (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains tirzepatide as 
the active substance and it is given by injection. 
Further information about the evaluation of Mounjaro’s benefits can be found in Mounjaro’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s webpage. 
Mounjaro is indicated as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for 
CWM, including weight loss and weight maintenance, in adults with an initial BMI of  
o  ≥30 kg/m2 (obesity) or 
o  ≥27 kg/m2 to <30 kg/m2 (overweight) in the presence of at least 1 weight-related 
comorbid condition (e.g., hypertension, dyslipidemia, obstructive sleep apnoea, CV 
disease, prediabetes, or T2DM.   
It contains tirzepatide as the active substance and is given by injection. 
II - Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or 
Further Characterise the Risks  
Important risks of Mounjaro, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Mounjaro’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be 
  specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals 
important advice on the medicine’s packaging 
the authorised pack size – the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly, and 
 
 
 
 
 
the medicine’s legal status – the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., 
with or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including periodic safety update report assessment, so that immediate action 
can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Mounjaro is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of Important Risks and Missing Information  
Important risks of Mounjaro are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Mounjaro. Potential risks are concerns for which 
an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

II.B Summary of Important Risks  
Important potential risk: Medullary thyroid cancer 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
In nonclinical studies, treatment-related increases in thyroid C-cell 
hyperplasia and neoplasia were observed with tirzepatide, at all 
doses, in a 2-year rat carcinogenicity study. This effect on rodent 
thyroids has been observed consistently with other long-acting 
GLP-1 RAs, including liraglutide, exenatide once weekly, 
dulaglutide, and semaglutide, in near-lifetime exposure 
carcinogenicity studies. The relevance to humans cannot be 
determined from clinical and nonclinical studies. At this time, 
there is insufficient evidence to attribute thyroid C-cell disease to 
tirzepatide. Given the latency for cancer, the database for 
tirzepatide is of insufficient size and exposure duration to assess 
definitively for any particular type of cancer.  
Nonclinical data suggest that there is a risk for MTC with 
tirzepatide, and this has been determined to be a key safety finding 
from the nonclinical development programme.  
Medullary thyroid carcinoma develops from the C (parafollicular) 
cells and accounts for 5% to 10% of all thyroid cancers (Brady 
2018), and up to 25% of MTC cases develop under multiple 
endocrine neoplasia-2A (IARC 2018). Compared to the general 
population (6.6%), patients with diabetes have a higher prevalence 
of thyroid disorders (10.8%) (Shih et al. 2012). However, the link 
between T2DM and thyroid cancer is arguable. Some studies did 
not show an association between diabetes, including T2DM and 
thyroid cancer risk (Kitahara et al. 2012; Shih et al. 2012; Seo et 
al. 2017). Other studies showed that patients with diabetes are 
20% to 34% more likely to develop thyroid cancer compared to 
those without diabetes (Yeo et al. 2014; Li and Qian 2017).  
Many studies show that the risk of thyroid cancer, specifically 
papillary thyroid cancer, increased in participants with overweight 
and obesity compared with normal-weight participants. It has been 
estimated that a 5-point increase in BMI and a 0.1-point increase 
in waist-to-hip ratio increase the risk of thyroid cancer by 30% and 
14%, respectively (Schmid et al. 2015; Kitahara et al. 2020; Li et 
al. 2020). Although there is a positive association between 
obesity/overweight and papillary, follicular, and anaplastic thyroid 
cancers, there was an inverse association noted with MTC 
(Schmid et al. 2015).

Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
There is no evidence from clinical trials that GLP-1-based 
therapies increase the risk of pancreatic cancer.  
Some literature reports indicate a causal association with these 
agents, while others have failed to show such an association. A 
joint FDA and EMA publication states that data demonstrate 
conflicting opinions about strength of the association (Egan et al. 
2014).  
To date, no causal relationship between tirzepatide and pancreatic 
malignancy has been established. Incidence of pancreatic 
malignancy was similar in the tirzepatide and placebo groups in 
the Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials for tirzepatide.  
Patients with long-standing T2DM are twice more likely to have 
pancreatic cancer than patients without T2DM (Yadav and 
Lowenfels 2013). About 0.5% of patients newly diagnosed with 
T2DM develop pancreatic cancer within 6 years of follow-up.  
Obesity increases risk of pancreatic cancer, with approximate 10% 
or greater increases in risk of pancreatic cancer for a 5 kg/m2 unit 
increase in BMI, or a 20% to 50% increased risk among those with 
obesity relative to participants with normal BMI (Berrington et al. 
2003; Larsson et al. 2007; Renehan et al. 2008).  
Being the fourth leading cause of cancer mortality, pancreatic 
cancer is a highly mortal malignancy, with 75% of patients dying 
within the first year of diagnosis (Bracci 2012). The 5-year 
survival rate among patients with pancreatic malignancy is about 
6% (Yadav and Lowenfels 2013).

Important potential risk: Diabetic retinopathy complications 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Worldwide, the prevalence of DR ranges between 10% and 61% 
(median 28%) among patients with T2DM and between 1.5% and 
31% (median 11%) among those newly diagnosed with T2DM 
(Ruta et al. 2013). The incidence rates of DR among adults aged 
30 years and older with T2DM in the UK and Spain were 11.6 and 
81.3 per 1000 people, respectively (Thomas et al. 2012; Romero-
 
 
 
 
 
Aroca et al. 2017).  
Deterioration of DR among patients with improved glycaemic 
control is well documented with limited information for patients 
with T2DM specifically (Hooymans et al. 1982; Yau et al. 2012; 
Bain et al. 2019). A study conducted by Oslo Study Group-
Brinchmann-Hansen et al. reported worsening of DR after 
introduction of stringent diabetes management within 3 months of 
treatment; approximately 50% of treated patients were affected 
compared with none of the patients treated conventionally (Oslo 
Study Group et al. 1985). A study conducted among patients with 
type 2 diabetes reported the risk of progression of DR after 3 and 9 
years was 15.8% and 23%, respectively, for patients treated with 
intensive therapy compared with 15.3% and 27.8%, respectively, 
for patients undergoing treatment with either insulin or a 
sulphonylurea (Bain et al 2019). A meta-analysis of 4 randomised 
controlled trials reported that after 5 years of follow-up, more 
intensive glucose control was associated with a 13% reduction of 
eye events (risk ratio: 0.87; 95% confidence interval: 0.76, 1.00; p 
= 0.04; Feldman-Billard et al. 2018). 
Patients with a history of proliferative DR, diabetic maculopathy, 
or non-proliferative DR that required acute treatment were 
excluded from the tirzepatide clinical trial development 
programme. A dedicated retinopathy addendum to SURPASS-
CVOT I8F-MC-GPGN (GPGN) is ongoing, which will further 
investigate the risk of disease progression for DR among patients 
treated with tirzepatide. The comparative analysis of the 
worsening of an existing DR with other diabetic treatment to 
tirzepatide treatment will be conducted after the addendum GPGN 
sub-study results are available. 
Therefore, there was limited experience to determine whether the 
safety profile in this patient population is different from that 
expected in the population without DR. In Phase 3 clinical trials, a 
dilated fundoscopic examination was performed when clinically 
indicated by any suspected adverse event of worsening retinopathy 
or clinically recommended during the course of the study. 
Worsening of fundoscopic examination result was observed in 18 
tirzepatide-treated patients (0.35%). 
Patients with T2DM are at risk of developing microvascular 
complications including DR, nephropathy, and neuropathy.  
Modifiable risk factors for DR include high blood glucose, high 
blood pressure, high serum lipids, and smoking. Non-modifiable 
risk factors include diabetes duration, age, race, and genetic 
predisposition (Ding and Wong 2012; Scanlon et al. 2013).

Mounjaro. 
II.C.2 Other Studies in Post-Authorisation Development Plan  
Study short name: A Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma Database Linkage Study (I8F-MC-B013) 
Purpose of the study: This is an observational database study using a matched cohort design. 
This study addresses the important potential risk of MTC observed in rodents across all GLP-1 
RAs.  
The primary objective is to estimate the incidence of medullary thyroid carcinoma among 
patients who are exposed to GLP-1 RAs and the GIP/GLP-1 RA tirzepatide, as compared to an 
unexposed matched comparator cohort using incidence rate ratios and 95% CIs.  
The secondary objectives are to 
  systematically monitor the annual incidence of MTC in adults (18 years of age and older) 
in the US for identification of any possible increase related to the introduction of GLP-1 
RAs and the GIP/GLP-1 RA tirzepatide, into the US market, and 
  characterise patients exposed to GLP-1 RAs and the GIP/GLP-1 RA tirzepatide, and 
unexposed matched comparator cohorts using demographic characteristics and other 
clinical characteristics, selected prescription medications dispensed during the baseline 
period, and duration of GLP-1 RA (including GIP/GLP-1 RA) use. 
Study short name: Tirzepatide Pancreatic Malignancy Study (I8F-MC-B011) 
Purpose of the study: This is a retrospective non-interventional cohort study that will address the 
safety concerns of pancreatic malignancy. 
The primary objectives of this study are to 
  estimate the incidence rate of pancreatic cancer among new users of tirzepatide 
  compare the incidence rate of pancreatic cancer among new users of tirzepatide to 
patients who are new users of other incretin-based therapies, and 
  compare the incidence rate of pancreatic cancer among new users of tirzepatide to 
patients who are new users of non-incretin-based therapies. 
The secondary objective of this study is to describe baseline characteristics (including 
demographics, lifestyle variables, medical conditions, medications) among patients who are 
new users of tirzepatide and patients who are new users of other incretin-based therapies and 
non-incretin-based therapies. 
Study short name: Retinopathy addendum to SURPASS-CVOT (I8F-MC-GPGN) 
 
 
Purpose of the study: This is a retinopathy addendum to SURPASS-CVOT (I8F-MC-GPGN) to 
be performed in addition to all procedures required by Protocol I8F-MC-GPGN or any

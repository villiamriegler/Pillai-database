Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for zonisamide, the scientific 
conclusions of the CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on hyperammonaemia from the literature and spontaneous reports, including 
in some cases a close temporal relationship and a positive de-challenge, and in view of a plausible 
mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between zonisamide and 
hyperammonaemia is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information 
of products containing zonisamide should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for zonisamide, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing zonisamide is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1 
Introduction 
2.2  Quality aspects 
2.2.1 Introduction 
Uptravi is presented as immediate release film-coated tablets containing 200 μg, 400 μg, 600 μg, 
800 μg, 1000 mg, 1200 μg, 1400 μg and 1600 μg of selexipag as active substance. 
Other ingredients in the tablet cores are mannitol (E421), maize starch, low substituted hydroxypropyl 
cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, and magnesium stearate. Ingredients in the film coating include: 
hypromellose, propylene glycol, titanium dioxide, iron oxide yellow (E172), iron oxide red (E172), iron 
oxide black (E172) and carnauba wax, as described in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The finished product is available in polyamide / aluminium / high-density polyethylene / polyethylene 
with an embedded desiccant agent / high-density polyethylene blister sealed with an aluminium foil 
(Alu/Alu blister with desiccant), as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2 Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of the active substance selexipag is 2-{4-[(5,6-diphenylpyrazin-2-yl) (isopropyl) 
amino] butoxy}-N-(methylsulfonyl) acetamide, corresponding to the molecular formula C26H32N4O4S 
and has a relative molecular mass 496.62 g/mol. It has the following structure: 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report 
Page 8/117 
 
 
 
Figure 1: Selexipag structure. 
The structure of the active substance has been confirmed by elemental analysis IR, 1H- and 13C-NMR 
spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy, UV spectroscopy and X-ray powder diffraction, all of which support 
the chemical structure. 
It appears as a pale yellow crystalline powder, non-hygroscopic powder. Selexipag shows different 
solubility characteristics in aqueous solutions and is insoluble at pH 2 to 4, freely soluble at pH 8 and 
very soluble from pH 9 to pH 12. Its dissociation constant pKa was found 2.6 when determined by UV 
method. Its logP in 1-octanol/water was found to be 2.2, in 1-octanol/aqueous HCl pH 1.2 was found 
3.0, and in 1-octanol/aqueous phosphate buffer, pH 6.9 was found 2.1. 
Selexipag is achiral. Three crystal forms named Form I, II and III are identified and discussed. All 
selexipag batches manufactured so far correspond to the polymorphic form I which is sufficiently stable 
at room temperature. The amounts of Form II and III have been also monitored during stability 
studies of the clinical batches and registration batches. For all batches, no change in the amount of 
Form II and Form III can be observed for all conditions tested. 
Selexipag is considered a new active substance from a quality perspective. The applicant compared its 
structure with active substances within authorised products in the EU and demonstrated that it is not a 
salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixtures of isomers, complex or derivative (e.g. pro-drug or metabolite) of 
any of them. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Selexipag is synthesized by a single manufacturer in four main steps using four well-defined starting 
materials with acceptable specifications as shown in figure 1. Three intermediate products are 
described. Critical steps have been defined and the in-process controls (IPCs) used to ensure the 
process performs as expected are described. Satisfactory information on the molecular formulae, 
weights, yield ranges, chemical structures of the starting materials, intermediates, reagents and 
solvents, operating conditions such as temperatures, mixing times and the in-process controls was 
provided. Any reprocessing, following ICH Q7 (crystallisation step or other appropriate chemical or 
physical manipulation steps that are part of the established manufacturing process), will be preceded 
by careful evaluation to ensure that the quality of the intermediate or active substance is not adversely 
impacted. The manufacturing process was optimised to address an increase of an impurity and levels 
of the undesired polymorphic form III. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised. 
The  active  substance  is  packaged  into  two  low-density  anti-static  polyethylene  bags  and  closed  with 
resealable tie-wraps. The bags are placed into a high-density polyethylene drum closed with a lid. The 
polyethylene bags comply with the relevant EC regulations and Ph. Eur. requirements. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes appropriate tests and limits for: appearance and colour 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report 
Page 9/117 
 
 
 
 
(visual inspection), clarity and colour of solution (Ph. Eur.), identity (IR, HPLC), residue on ignition/ 
sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.), heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), related 
substances (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), particle size (laser light diffraction) and microbiological 
quality (Ph. Eur.).  
Form II is exempted from routine control in the final active substance because it was never detected in 
any batch manufactured and during stability studies. Two solvents are routinely tested since these 
solvents are used in the final step of the manufacturing process. The proposed limit of ACT-333679 is 
considered acceptable form a toxicological point of view because this is the active metabolite of 
selexipag.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standard used for testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results from three registration batches and three validation batches all of commercial 
scale were provided. The submitted batch analysis data comply with the specifications and confirm that 
the manufacture is sufficiently robust and provide reassurance that the process yields active substance 
of consistent quality. However, following the manufacturing process optimisation, only one batch has 
been manufactured- the last validation batch.  Therefore in order to demonstrate consistent quality the 
active substance following the process optimisation the CHMP recommended to investigate first three 
active substance batches (Continuous Process Verification Batches) intensively and the batch analysis 
certificates and a Continuous Process Verification Summary Report for these batches should be 
provided once the three batches have been manufactured i.e., presumably in 2019. 
Stability 
Stability data on three commercial scale and one supportive clinical batch of active substance in the 
intended commercial packaging for up to 36 months (48 months for the clinical batch) under long term 
conditions at 25 °C/60 % RH and for up to six months under accelerated conditions at 40 °C/75 % RH 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The parameters tested were appearance, content of 
polymorphic form III (not routinely performed), loss on drying, related substances, assay, microbial 
limit (not routinely performed) and particle size distribution (not routinely performed). The same 
analytical procedures as for the release analysis were used, which had been shown to be stability 
indicating. 
No significant changes or trends were observed either at long-term conditions or accelerated 
conditions. The results comply with the current specifications. Similar results were obtained for the 
supportive clinical batch and the registration batches. However none of the stability batches have been 
manufactured using the optimised manufacturing process, therefore the CHMP recommended that 
further stability data from the first three continuous Process Verification Batches to demonstrate 
consistent quality of the active substance should be provided. 
The stability of the active substance was also investigated one batch under stress conditions according 
to the Notes for Guidance Q1A (R2) and ICH Q1B. Samples were exposed to heat and moisture, light 
(solid state and solution), acidic, basic and oxidising conditions. Hydrolysis occurred under both acidic 
and basic conditions. Degradation was also noted under oxidising conditions (hydrogen peroxide). Light 
exposure of the substance in solution resulted in a significant increase of three impurities. In solid 
state though, selexipag was shown to be not sensitive to light. 
Based on presented stability data, the proposed retest period of 48 months below 25 °C is acceptable.

2.2.3 Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Uptravi is an immediate release film-coated tablet. Tablets are debossed with a number indicating the 
strength and also have different colours to allow strength differentiation.  
Potential changes of the polymorphic form were investigated and the impact on the dissolution and 
stability of selexipag film-coated tablets has been investigated too. Although process-induced phase 
transitions might potentially occur to a certain extent, they would be below the limit where they would 
have an impact on the properties of the finished product. In addition since no evidence for the 
polymorphic change was detected in tablets stored for 18 months at 30°C/75% RH and additionally 
stored for 1 week at 80°C and for 1 month at 60°C. 
Once the compatibility of the active substance with different excipients was studied, further studies 
were conducted which led to the selection of binder and disintegrant and diluents, and to the 
optimisation of  the composition. Some of them were subjected to photostability studies leading to the 
conclusion that the core tablets were light-sensitive.  
Due to the photo-sensitivity of the core tablets it was decided to apply a coating.  After testing several 
formulations with different combinations of these pigments the formulation to be used in clinical 
batches was established. 
Tablets of 100, 200, 400 and 800 µg were used in clinical trials. The strength of 200 µg was used in all 
clinical trials, including the phase 3 pivotal study were only this strength was used to administer doses 
up to 1600 µg. Tablets of 1600 µg were used in the in-vivo bioequivalence study intended to 
demonstrate the equivalence of administering a single tablet of 1600 µg and 8 tablets of 200 µg. The 
bioequivalence of the intermediate strengths is supported by in-vitro dissolution tests conducted at all 
dose strengths in dissolution media with pH: 1.2, 4.5, 5.5 and 6.8. Since it is known that selexipag has 
a low solubility especially in low pH aqueous buffer values, sink conditions for all strengths are 
achieved at pH 6.8 only which is the pH of the dissolution medium used for routine QC testing. At pH 
values where sink conditions may not be achievable for all strengths, in vitro dissolution may differ 
between different strengths. For that reason, similarity of the dissolution profile has been 
demonstrated at the same dose as per the guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence. As far as 
the discriminatory power of the QC dissolution method this has been demonstrated with regard to 
manufacturing and formulation changes. 
The composition of core tablets used during the clinical trials was always the same proposed for 
marketing authorisation and used to manufacture the 'registration batches' manufactured at 
commercial scale for the validation of the manufacturing process and for the formal stability studies. 
The exact colour of each tablet strength has been modified during development as it became apparent 
that more strengths are needed in the clinic, however the coatings used contained the same qualitative 
and quantitative composition in non-colouring components (hypromellose and propyleneglycol) and 
differing only in the amounts of the same four pigments tested during development (titanium dioxide 
and iron oxides red,yellow and black). These changes in the quantitative composition of the coloring 
agents are not considered to affect either the performance characteristics of the tablets (e.g., 
dissolution rate) or the stability behavior. 
Development batches during pharmaceutical and clinical development were manufactured in different 
sites but from the optimisation studies onwards all batches (e.g. registration and stability) have been 
manufactured at the proposed site. 
The manufacturing process as such could be considered as standard considering the dosage form 
(immediate release tablets) and the kind of operations used for manufacture. Nevertheless the very 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report 
Page 11/117 
 
 
low load of active substance in the tablets (between 0.148 % and 1.185 % w/w of the core tablet) 
poses a challenge to the manufacturing process. Considering this and the type of the dosage form it 
was deemed reasonable that the critical quality attributes were the uniformity of the blends during the 
manufacture, the content uniformity of the tablets (both coated and uncoated) and the comparison of 
the dissolution behaviour of the tablets. In addition, degradation of the active substance (particularly 
when stored under stress conditions) was detected and related to some extent with some 
manufacturing parameters and has been addressed in the DoE optimization of the manufacturing 
process. 
Uptravi tablets are packed in Alu/Alu blister with embedded desiccant. The selected primary packaging 
is common for this dosage form and the included desiccant has been shown to be protective against 
degradation of active substance, in particular hydrolysis, as it has been confirmed in the stability 
studies. The packaging material (including the desiccant) complies with the relevant EU regulations 
and Ph.Eur. requirements. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  product  manufacture  comprises  the  following  main  steps:  dry  blending,  wet  granulation,  drying, 
milling,  lubrication,  compression,  coating,  polishing  and  packaging.  Due  to  the  low  drug  load,  the 
process is considered to be a non-standard process. Critical steps have been identified and a number 
of  measures  were  implemented  to  mitigate  the  risk  of  content  uniformity  failure  together  with 
adequate in-process controls for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
The manufacturing process has been validated at commercial scale with three batches of each strength 
and  one  additional  validation  batch  of  each  strength  will  be  added  before  commercialisation.  It  has 
been  demonstrated  that  the  manufacturing  process  is  capable  of  producing  the  finished  product  of 
intended quality in a reproducible manner. 
Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf life specification include tests and limits for: appearance, colour 
and diameter (visual/calliper), average tablet mass (gravimetry), identification (HPLC/DAD), content 
uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), water content (Ph. Eur), assay and content per tablet (HPLC), 
impurities (HPLC), dissolution (Ph. Eur.- HPLC) and microbial quality (Ph. Eur).  
The tests and acceptance criteria were set generally in accordance to ICH Q6A. For the actual limits set 
for degradation products the results of clinical batches and stability data of registration batches and to 
the  thresholds  established  in  the  guideline  ICH Q3(B)  on  impurities  in  new  drug  products  were  also 
considered.  In  addition,  mention  is  made  to  the  fact  that  ACT-333679  is  a  know  metabolite  of 
selexipag. 
Considering  that  no  evidence  for  the  polymorphic  change  from  Form  I  to  Form  II,  or  Form  III  was 
detected in tablets during stability and stress studies, it is considered justified that a test for Forms II 
and III not to be included in the finished product specification. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standard used for testing has been presented. 
Batch analyses results of three commercial scale batches for each strength of Uptravi were provided 
and all batches meet the specification. 
Stability of the product 
Initially only five strengths (i.e. 200, 400, 800, 1200 and 1600 µg) were considered for development 
and stability studies were initiated with them.  When it was decided to develop further intermediate 
strengths (600, 1000 and 1400 µg) additional stability studies were initiated and, in addition, a 
reduced testing approach applying bracketing /matrixing was applied. The design of stability studies is 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report

deemed satisfactory as it is according to the guidelines ICH Q1A on stability testing and ICH Q1D on 
bracketing and matrixing designs. The justification for using a reduced testing scheme for intermediate 
strengths is supported. 
Stability data on three commercial scale batches per strength (for 200, 400, 800, 1200 and 1600 µg) 
stored under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and intermediate conditions 30 ºC / 75% RH for 
up to 24 months and for up six months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) were provided. 
In addition stability data for three commercial scale batches per strength (for 600, 1000 and 1400 µg) 
stored under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and intermediate conditions 30 ºC / 75% RH for 
up  to  12  months  and  for up  six  months  under  accelerated  conditions (40  ºC  /  75%  RH)  according  to 
the  ICH  guidelines  were  also  provided.  All  the  stability  batches  are  identical  to  those  proposed  for 
marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  colour,  assay,  degradation  products,  dissolution  and  microbial 
quality.  The  analytical  procedures  used  were  the  same  as  for  release  and  were  shown  to  be  stability 
indicating.  
All results remain within shelf-life specifications for all the samples tested at all the sampling time 
points under all storage conditions. No significant change was observed except for degradation 
products. The levels of degradation products show a consistent increase under all storage conditions. 
The increase is more relevant for the lower dose strengths and for higher temperature and relative 
humidity. The applicant presented results of statistical analysis of stability data as per Appendix A of 
guideline ICH Q1E to support the extrapolation of these conclusion to the remaining three strengths 
(600, 1000 and 1400 µg). The statistical analysis is considered acceptable. 
Photostability of selexipag 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200, 1400 and 1600 μg film-coated tablets has 
been  investigated  in  accordance  with  the  ICH  guideline  Q1B.  No  significant  difference  in  appearance, 
color and assay could be observed between samples exposed to intense light and control samples. No 
increase  of  known  impurities  was  observed  and  no  new  impurities  above  the  limits  were  observed. 
Therefore Uptravi film-coated tablets can be considered as photo stable and it is not necessary to store 
the product protected from light. 
Based on the presented data, the proposed 3 year shelf life without any special storage conditions as 
stated in the SmPC are acceptable. 
2.2.4 Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance has been presented in a 
satisfactory manner. The development, manufacture and controls of the finished product have been 
sufficiently documented and justified. The results of tests of active substance and finished product 
carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these 
in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in 
clinical use.  
2.2.5  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6 Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report 
Page 13/117 
 
 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
1.  The first three active substance batches should be investigated intensively and the 
batch analysis certificates and a Continuous Process Verification Summary Report for 
these batches should be provided once the three batches have been manufactured.  
2.  Further stability data from the first three continuous to demonstrate consistent quality 
of the active substance should be provided. 
2.3  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1 Introduction 
PAH is characterized by pulmonary vasoconstriction, vascular cell proliferation and vascular 
hypertrophy leading to an increase in pulmonary artery pressure, right ventricular hypertrophy and 
right heart failure (Stearman et al. 2014). Endothelial dysfunction plays a key role in the pathogenesis 
of PAH and loss of expression of PGI2-synthase represents one of the phenotypic alterations present in 
the pulmonary endothelial cells in severe PH (Tuder et al. 1999, Stearman et al. 2014). A decreased 
expression of the IP receptor has been found in the remodeled pulmonary arterial smooth muscle. 
The applicant provided non clinical data from a full non clinical programme as detailed below. The non 
clinical studies performed with selexipag are summarized. In most original reports of the in-vitro 
functional assays, the Applicant has given IC50/EC50 values for the total concentrations. In the 
following the values for free IC50/EC50 values are also given, taking the extent of protein binding in the 
incubation media into account.  
2.3.2 Pharmacology 
Selexipag is an orally active non-prostanoid prostacyclin (PGI2) receptor agonist with a long-half-life, 
selectivity for the IP receptor minimizing off-target effects especially in the gastrointestinum and a lack 
of IP receptor desensitization processes which avoids the development of tachyphylaxis. The active 
metabolite ACT-333679 is at least 16-fold more potent than selexipag in cellular systems and is 
present at 3- to 4-fold higher plasma concentrations than the parent drug at steady-state in humans.  
The receptors sensitive to prostaglandins D2, E2, F2a, I2 and thromboxane A2 are termed the DP, EP, 
FP, IP and TP receptors, respectively (Whittle et al. 2012, Yokohama et al. 2013). 
Prostanoid receptors are classified into three groups according to molecular evolution, associated 
primary G proteins and second messengers: cluster 1 consists of the relaxant EP2, EP4, IP and DP1, 
which are coupled with Gsa proteins and therefore activate AC to increase cAMP; cluster 2 consists of 
the contractile EP1, FP and TP, which couple with Gqa and increase intracellular calcium concentrations; 
cluster 3 consists of the inhibitory receptor EP3, which is coupled with Gia and which can couple to both 
elevation of intracellular calcium and a decrease in cAMP (review in Yokohama et al. 2013). 
Prostacyclin (prostaglandin I2, PGI2), synthesized from arachidonic acid by the sequential action of 
cyclooxygenase and PGI2 synthase in endothelial cells, is a potent vasodilator, antithrombotic and 
antiplatelet agent. PGI2 plays a role in the development of pulmonary hypertension: in human 
pulmonary hypertension, IP expression is decreased; overexpression of PGI2 synthase reduces 
elevated pulmonary blood pressure, and IP knockout mice developed more severe pulmonary 
hypertension and vascular remodelling after chronic hypoxic exposure (review in Smyth and Fitzgerald 
2002).

The human prostanoid IP receptor has been cloned and demonstrated to be a member of the G-
protein-coupled receptor gene superfamily (Boie et al. 1994). IP receptors are distributed widely 
throughout the body with high expression in the lung, heart and kidney, and activation of IP receptors 
is coupled to the formation of the second messenger cAMP (review in Smyth 2002). Prostanoids are 
potent vasodilators and possess antithrombotic and antiproliferative properties; whereas the 
pharmacological properties of prostanoids acting via the IP receptor are similar, they differ markedly in 
pharmacokinetics (e.g. half-lives are 2 min for prostacyclin, but 30 - 80 min for treprostinil; review in 
Olschewski et al. 2004). Several PGI2 analogues have been approved for the treatment of PAH, 
including epoprostenol (intravenous), iloprost (inhaled), treprostinil (intravenous, subcutaneous and 
inhaled (oral in US only)) and beraprost (oral in Japan and South Korea only). These PGI2 analogues 
are non-selective IP receptor agonists, since they also activate other prostanoid receptors such as the 
EP3 and EP4 receptors. The EP3 receptor is responsible for gastric contraction and vomiting induced by 
PGI2 analogues (Morrison et al. 2010, Kan et al. 2002). 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In-vitro: 
Selexipag and its main metabolite ACT-333679 have high affinity to prostacyclin (PGI2) receptors 
expressed in CHO cells with Ki values of 263 and 19.8 nM, respectively, and both substances show 
selectivity for this receptor, since binding to 7 other prostanoid receptors (EP1-4, DP, FP and TP) 
occurred at much higher (micromolar) concentrations (Kuwano et al. 2007). In contrast, PGI2 
analogues (e.g. beraprost) have lower selectivity for PGI2 versus other prostanoid receptors.  
Selexipag and its main metabolite ACT-333679 increased intracellular cAMP concentrations in CHO cells 
expressing the human prostacyclin (PGI2) receptor with EC50 values of 177 and 11.5 nM, respectively, 
and, therefore, metabolite ACT-333679 was about 16-fold more potent compared to selexipag in this 
assay. 
In HEK 293 cells expressing prostanoid receptors and using stimulation of adenylate cyclase as the 
parameter, ACT-333679 and selexipag demonstrated pronounced species differences at the IP 
receptor, whereas iloprost did not. The EC50 values for free substances at the human, rat and dog IP 
receptors were 4, 170 and 1100 nM for selexipag, respectively, and 0.17, 3.1 and 14 nM for metabolite 
ACT-333679, respectively, demonstrating sensitivity in the order human > rat > dog. Whereas 
selexipag was inactive at EP2 and EP4 receptors, ACT-333679 was weakly active at the EP2 receptor, 
but similar active at the dog EP4 receptor (EC50 value of 18 nM) compared to the IP receptor. 
In human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells, ACT-333679 increased the intracellular cAMP 
concentration with an EC50 value of 265 nM (re-calculated free EC50 value of 7.4 nM) and was a partial 
agonist (31% of the maximum response).  
Agonist-activated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) couple to G proteins to induce a cellular 
response, and are subsequently phosphorylated by the G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs); the 
GRK-phosphorylated receptor then acts as a substrate for the binding of arrestins, which uncouple the 
receptor and G protein, desensitizing the agonist-induced response and leading to the development of 
tachyphylaxis (review in Kelly et al. 2008). In CHO cells expressing the IP receptor, ACT-333679 and 
selexipag had lower efficacy in recruiting β-arrestin and in inducing internalization of the IP receptors 
compared to prostacyclin analogues (iloprost, treprostinil and beraprost). The potencies of the 
compounds in the cAMP assays were considerably shifted leftward versus the β-arrestin assay (free 
EC5o values for selexipag and ACT-333679 were: 0.58 nM and 0.031 nM in the cAMP assay, 13 nM and 
1.4 nM in the ß-arrestin assay). It is hypothesized by the Applicant that due to the partial agonism in 
the desensitization pathway, ACT-333679 and selexipag might induce reduced tachyphylaxis in vivo. 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report

IP receptor activation induces vascular smooth muscle relaxation through PKA-mediated myosin light-
chain kinase (MLCK) phosphorylation (Merritt et al. 1991), and in cultured pulmonary arterial smooth 
muscle cells selexipag and metabolite ACT-333679 induced vascular smooth muscle relaxation with 
EC50 values of 157 and 4.3 nM, respectively (the re-calculated free EC50 values were 2.5 nM and 0.12 
nM, respectively), via a stimulation of PKA-mediated MLCK phosphorylation. 
PGI2 analogues inhibit the proliferation of human pulmonary arteries via a cAMP-dependent pathway 
(Clapp et al. 2002), and cell cycle progression from G1-to S-phase is inhibited by block of CRE- and 
pocket protein-dependent cyclin A gene expression (Kothapalli et al. 2003). ACT-333679 inhibited the 
platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-mediated 3Hthymidine uptake in cultured human pulmonary 
artery smooth muscle cells (hPASMC) with an IC50 value of 400 nM and the platelet-derived growth 
factor-BB (PDGF-BB)-induced proliferation of human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMC) 
with an IC50 value of 2.9 nM (the re-calculated free IC50 value was 0.081 nM). 
TGF-ß1 is a cytokine involved via a production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the process of 
pulmonary fibrogenesis (review in Todd 2012), and IP receptor activation via the PKA-dependent 
inhibition of Ras/MEK/ERK signaling inhibits synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins induced by pro-
fibrotic mediators such as PDGF-BB and TGF-ß1 (Stratton et al. 2001 and 2002). ACT-333679 (0.1 - 
10 µM) reduced TGF-ß1-stimulated up-regulation of collagen production on normal human lung 
fibroblast cells (NHLF) and had anti-fibrotic activity. Furthermore, ACT-333679 inhibited platelet-
derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB)-induced and transforming growth factor-ß1 (TGF-ß1)-induced 
extracellular 3Hproline incorporation, a measure of extracellular matrix synthesis, in primary normal 
human lung fibroblasts (NHLF) with an IC50 value of 9.7 nM (the re-calculated free IC50 value was 0.27 
nM). 
The IC50/EC50 values for free selexipag and ACT-333679 are lower compared to the Ki values obtained 
in binding experiments, indicating the presence of spare IP receptors. This hypothesis is supported by 
the observation that in humans, values for therapeutically effective free maximum plasma 
concentrations are 0.12 nM for selexipag and 0.28 nM for ACT-333679 following administration of the 
1600 μg b.i.d. dose. These concentrations are in the range of the IC50/EC50 values and, therefore, 
sufficient to stimulate the IP receptors. The existence of differences in spare IP receptors together with 
differences in the degrees of signal amplification of the IP receptor signaling cascade can explain the 
different potencies of selexipag/ACT-333679 in functional assays performed in different in-vitro test 
systems. 
Mice were used in the carcinogenicity studies and rabbits in the reproductive and developmental 
toxicity studies performed with selexipag. There are marked species differences in the affinity/potency 
of selexipag and ACT-333679 at the IP receptor. In order to give an explanation for the findings 
observed in mouse carcinogenicity studies and in the rabbit reproductive and developmental toxicity 
studies, the Applicant has provided results from a new study in which in vitro potencies (EC50 values), 
as measured by cAMP accumulation, were determined in recombinant cells expressing similar levels of 
the mouse, rabbit, or human IP receptor. EC50 values for selexipag and ACT-333679 were: 22 uM and 
960 nM, respectively, at the rabbit IP receptor, 25 uM and 730 nM, respectively, at the mouse IP 
receptor (based on total concentrations). Rabbit and mouse IP-receptors have 61and 69-fold lower 
potencies for selexipag and 74- and 56-fold lower potencies for ACT-333679, respectively, compared 
to humans (based on total concentrations). 
In-vivo: 
Selexipag decreased the mean arterial blood pressure and increased the heart rate (in normotensive 
rats at i.d. doses of 10 mg/kg for MAP and > 3 mg/kg for HR; in conscious spontaneous hypertensive 
rats (SHRs) at oral doses of 1 - 10 mg/kg) and increased femoral skin blood flow in anaesthetized rats 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report 
Page 16/117 
 
 
(at i.d. doses of 1 - 10 mg/kg). No tachyphylaxis was observed after 4 weeks of administration in 
anaesthetized rats or after 10 days of administration in SHR. 
Two models of PH in rats were used: (1) the rat monocrotaline (MCT) model of PH (Chesney 1973) is 
characterized by pulmonary hypertension (elevated right ventricular systolic pressure, cor pulmonale), 
medial thickening and endothelial dysfunction in the pulmonary artery and right ventricular 
hypertrophy (RVH) (Meyrick et al. 1980, review in Gomez-Arroyo 2012); MCT is activated to a reactive 
metabolite in the liver which is transported to the lung, where it initiates endothelial injury (review in 
Wilson et al. 1992); (2) the Sugen-hypoxia model of PH was developed from the observation that an 
inhibition of the VEGF receptor 2 with Sugen 5416 (a VEGF receptor 2 blocker) in combination with 
chronic hypoxia causes cell death-dependent pulmonary endothelial cell proliferation and severe 
pulmonary hypertension, since in this model chronic reduction of the alveolar oxygen pressure elicits 
pulmonary arterial vasoconstriction and vascular remodelling of the distal branches of pulmonary 
arteries leading to PH (Taraseviciene-Stewart 2011). In MCT-PH Wistar rats, selexipag had the 
following effects: 5 days of repeated selexipag administration (10 mg/kg, p.o., b.i.d.) decreased 
pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) without affecting the HR, and the efficacy of selexipag was 
maintained over the 5-day treatment period; selexipag at 1 mg/kg twice daily for 19 days suppressed 
the increase of RVSP and RVH in MCT-induced PH rats; MCT-induced PH accompanied by hypertrophy 
of the pulmonary artery was suppressed by selexipag orally administered at 1 mg/kg twice daily for 19 
days; oral administration of selexipag at 1 mg/kg twice daily for 19 days ameliorated the attenuated 
acetylcholine-induced relaxation of PGF2α-pre-contracted pulmonary arteries; right ventricular 
hypertrophy was suppressed by the oral administration of selexipag at doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg twice 
daily for 19 days; the survival of MCT-treated rats was prolonged by selexipag orally administered at a 
dose of 1 mg/kg twice daily for 45 days. 
In conscious Sugen-hypoxia PH rats, selexipag at oral doses of 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg dose-dependently 
decreased mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP), MAP and core body temperature, and increased 
HR and tail temperature. The effects of selexipag on pulmonary (MPAP decrease) and peripheral 
haemodynamics (peripheral vasodilation leading to tail temperature increase) correlated, which 
indicates that selexipag shows no selectivity for pulmonary vs. peripheral arteries. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Neither selexipag nor ACT-333679 tested at concentrations of up to 10 µM had marked effects in 69 
enzyme and radioligand binding assays. 
Selexipag and ACT-333679 induced a concentration-dependent increase of intra-platelet cAMP in 
human platelets with EC50 values of 40 μM and 550 nM, respectively (the re-calculated free EC50 
values were 120 nM and 2.2 nM, respectively). The maximal elevation of cAMP induced by both 
selexipag and ACT-333679 was lower compared to other IP receptor agonists, indicating that ACT-
333679 is a partial agonist of the IP receptor. 10 µM ADP-induced platelet aggregation was inhibited 
with IC50 values of 4655 nM for selexipag and 121 nM for ACT-333679; at a lower ADP concentration 
of 3 μM, the potency of ACT-333679 was higher (IC50 value of 74 nM). Selexipag inhibited platelet 
aggregation induced by ADP in platelet-rich plasma from humans and monkeys with IC50 values of 5.5 
and 3.4 μM, respectively (the re-calculated free IC50 values were 17 nM and 0.84 nM, respectively), 
but showed a very weak inhibition in dogs (IC50 value >100 μM), and ACT-333679 inhibited platelet 
aggregation in platelet-rich plasma from humans, monkeys, dogs and rats with IC50 values of 0.21, 
0.21, 25 and 10 μM, respectively. The effects of a single i.d. dose of 10 mg/kg selexipag on thrombus 
formation in rat femoral artery induced by 10% (w/w) ferric chloride (FeCl3) in vivo consisted of a 
prolongation of the average time to occlusion (TTO).

Safety pharmacology programme 
In rats, selexipag had no effects on the central nervous system at doses of up to 30 mg/kg. At a dose 
of 10 mg/kg, selexipag did not affect respiratory function, whereas at higher doses of selexipag (≥  30 
mg/kg) transiently increased respiration rate, tidal volume and minute volume were observed.  
No marked effects of selexipag and ACT-333679 at micromolar concentrations were observed on hERG 
channels expressed in CHO cells. Force and rate of contraction were not markedly affected by 
selexipag and ACT-333679 in isolated right atria from guinea pigs. In isolated guinea pig papillary 
muscles, selexipag shortened the action potential duration in a concentration-dependent manner at 
concentrations of 10 - 100 µM. After administration of single oral doses of selexipag to conscious male 
Beagle dogs, MAP decreased at doses ≥  1 mg/kg and HR increased at doses of > 3 mg/kg, and at 
doses of > 1 mg/kg the QT interval shortened, which seemed to be caused by HR changes since QTcF 
intervals were not affected.  
In male Sprague-Dawley rats, single oral administration of selexipag did not have marked effects on 
bleeding time, PT or APTT at doses of up to 100 mg/kg. 
In the isolated rat uterus, ACT-333679 at concentrations of 30 and 100 μM decreased the frequency of 
spontaneous contractions. 
In male Sprague-Dawley rats, oral administration of selexipag decreased urinary Cl− secretion and 
Na+/K+ ratio dose-dependently at doses of 10 - 100 mg/kg, and urinary Na+ excretion and urine 
volume slightly decreased at 30 and 100 mg/kg. These effects are known effects of IP receptor 
agonists. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
In fasted Sprague-Dawley rats, oral administration of single doses of 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg selexipag 
inhibited intestinal transport of charcoal, and i.d. doses of 10 - 100 mg/kg decreased the total acid 
output of gastric juice. 
Contractile EP3 receptors are implicated in emesis and diarrhoea (Kan et al. 2002) and are located on 
the rat gastric fundus (Morrison et al. 2010). Neither selexipag nor ACT-333679 at concentrations of 1 
mM contracted rat fundus, whereas the nonselective PGI2 analogues iloprost, beraprost and 
treprostinil contracted rat fundal strips, which was antagonized by an EP3 receptor antagonist. 
Selexipag and ACT-333679 did not have synergistic effects with contractile α1ARs in rat femoral 
arteries, whereas activation of EP3 receptors by non-selective analogues of PGI2 is enhanced by α1AR 
stimulation. 
Both PGE2 and PGI2 reduce the threshold of nociceptor sensory neurons to stimulation (review in 
Smyth et al. 2009).  IP prostacyclin receptor agonists have the potential to induce neurogenic pain 
(Bley et al. 1998, review in Rahman et al. 2011).  
2.3.3 Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic profile of selexipag was mainly characterized in the rat and dog, the species used 
in the repeated dose toxicity studies. 
Absorption 
Selexipag was rapidly absorbed after oral administration in rats, dogs and monkeys with tmax values of 
1 – 4 h. Selexipag exposure was lower than that to ACT-333679 in all species, and this difference was 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report 
Page 18/117 
 
 
 
2-fold in monkeys, 6-fold in rats and 13-fold in dogs. After administration of selexipag, the oral 
bioavailability of ACT-333679 was 57% in rats and 29% in monkeys. In rats, the pharmacokinetics of 
selexipag after oral administration was linear to doses of 0.3 - 3 mg/kg. In rats, food intake did not 
affect the extent of absorption of selexipag, and no sex differences in the pharmacokinetics were 
observed. ACT-333679 was rapidly absorbed in the rat with an oral bioavailability of 57%. 
Distribution 
The selexipag-related radioactivity distributed rapidly through the whole body and the highest 
concentrations were found in the liver followed by the gastro-intestinal tract, small intestine, stomach, 
kidney, lung, i.e. in organs involved in the absorption and elimination of the substance. Selexipag 
hardly passes the blood-brain-barrier. Tissue concentrations of radioactivity decreased in parallel with 
the decrease in the plasma concentrations. In pigmented rats, limited binding of 14C-selexipag-related 
radioactivity to melanin was observed. 
Placental transfer of selexipag/metabolites was shown with maximum fetal radioactivity concentrations 
of about 15% of maternal plasma concentrations representing altogether 0.01% of the dose. 
Binding of selexipag and ACT-333679 in rat, dog, monkey and man sera was in a range of 97–99%. 
Both substances bind to human serum albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein. Equilibrium dialysis studies in 
mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, monkey, and man plasma gave free fractions of 0.3-0.6% for selexipag and 
0.4-0.8% for ACT-333679. The volume of distribution at steady-state was 1.8-2.5 l/kg, i.e. in excess 
of total body water in rats and dogs, indicating good tissue penetration. 
Metabolism 
Selexipag undergoes five types of primary biotransformation reactions, and the main pathway is 
hydrolysis of the sulfonamide and formation of the pharmacologically active acid ACT-333679 via a 
carboxylesterase-mediated reaction. Formation of ACT-333679 is the major metabolic pathway of 
selexipag in all species, although some interspecies differences in terms of turnover as wells as of 
metabolic profiles were observed. Hepatic microsomes from all tested species including humans are 
able to form ACT-333679, whereas microsomes of the small intestines from all species including 
humans are not able to hydrolyse selexipag. Selexipag was hydrolysed to ACT-333679 in plasma of rat 
and mouse, whereas little or no degradation occurred in plasma of dog, rabbit, cynomolgus monkey 
and man. Metabolism of ACT-333679 was lower compared to selexipag in all tested species including 
human. Therefore, whereas ACT-333679 formation in rabbit, dog, cynomolgus monkey and human is 
mostly catalysed by hepatic microsomal enzymes, in the mouse and rat - in addition to hepatic 
microsomal enzymes - carboxylesterases present in plasma are also responsible for selexipag 
hydrolysis and formation of ACT-333679. CYP2C8 is mainly involved in the formation of MRE-6300 (a 
hydroxylated metabolite of ACT-333679), and CYP3A4 is also involved. Human UGT1A3 is involved in 
the glucuronidation of ACT-333679 to the acyl glucuronide P11 followed by UGT2B7. 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report

Figure 2: The proposed metabolic pathways of selexipag in rat, dog, and human. 
Excretion 
In rats, biliary excretion was the major elimination pathway of selexipag after either the oral or 
intravenous route of administration accounting for about 90-95% of the absorbed dose, and renal 
elimination of hydrophilic metabolites was much less important (0.9 - 4.7% of the dose). In dogs, 
biliary excretion was also the main excretion pathway (80 - 89% of total radioactivity), whereas renal 
excretion was much less important (< 2% of total radioactivity). 
Selexipag and/or its metabolites transferred into milk. The exposure to radioactivity was 2.5-fold 
higher in milk than in plasma. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Both selexipag and ACT-333679 possess good membrane permeabilities, and this behaviour seems to 
be primarily responsible for the tissue distribution of these substances. In rats, selexipag administered 
orally for 7 days at doses of 1 and 10 mg/kg/die had no effect on drug-metabolizing liver enzymes. 
Selexipag and ACT-333679 inhibited CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 activities at supra-
therapeutic micromolar concentrations, and both substances did not affect the human multidrug 
resistance protein MDR-1 (ABCB1, P-gp). Selexipag is a weak substrate of human P-gp indicating that 
P-gp is involved in the transport of selexipag through the cell monolayers, whereas ACT-333679 is not 
a substrate of P-gp. Selexipag is a weak substrate for both OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 transporters, and 
ACT-333679 is also a weak substrate for OATP1B3. Selexipag and ACT-333679 inhibited the activities 
of both OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 transporters only at supra-therapeutic micromolar concentrations. 
Selexipag is not a BCRP substrate, whereas ACT-333679 is a BCRP substrate. At micromolar 
concentrations, both selexipag and ACT-333679 inhibited OAT1-, BCRP-, BSEP-, OAT3- and MATE1-
transporters, and ACT-333679 also inhibited the MRP2-transporter. In human hepatocytes, both 
selexipag and ACT-333679 induced CYP isoenzyme mRNAs with the following free EC50 values: 20

nM/90 nM for CYP3A4, 6 nM/29 nM for CYP2C9. These free EC50 values are above therapeutically 
effective free plasma concentrations (0.12 nM selexipag, 0.28 nM ACT-333679). However, assuming a 
luminal selexipag concentration of 1.3 µM and a free selexipag concentration in enterocytes of 8 nM, 
clinically relevant induction of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 in the gut cannot be excluded. Therefore, the 
administration of selexipag at the highest proposed dose in PAH patients (1600 µg b.i.d.) could be an 
inducer of both CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 in the intestine. Although in a study in healthy subjects, selexipag 
(400 µg b.i.d.) did not alter the exposure to S-warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate) or R-warfarin (CYP3A4 
substrate) after a single dose of 20 mg warfarin, interactions with CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 in humans 
treated with the highest proposed dose have not been studied and thus potential interactions at 
clinically relevant concentrations cannot be ruled out. 
In conclusion, based on the re-calculated free concentrations of selexipag and ACT-333679 in the in-
vitro pharmacokinetic interaction studies, selexipag and its metabolite do not seem to have any 
relevant inhibitory potential on CYP P450 enzymes, on transport proteins or on BCRP in the gut. 
However, an induction of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 by selexipag in the gut cannot be excluded.  
2.3.4 Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Single dose toxicity of selexipag was determined in Slc:ddY mice, Slc:SD rats and Beagle dogs. The 
maximum non-lethal i.v. dose of selexipag was 40 mg/kg in mice and rats. After oral dosing the 
maximum non-lethal dose of selexipag was 250 mg/kg in rats and 200 mg/kg in male dogs. 
Repeat-dose toxicity 
Repeat-dose toxicity of selexipag was determined in B6C3F1/Crlj mice, SD rats and Beagle dogs. 
In mice, liver weight increased (at doses of 300 mg/kg/day in a 13 week study), correlating 
histologically with hypertrophy of centrilobular hepatocytes, and these alterations seemed to be related 
to the induction of drug-metabolizing enzymes. 
In rats, selexipag-induced mortality occurred in repeated dose toxicity studies in rats after oral 
treatment at doses of ≥  500 mg/kg/day and was related to marked vasodilation induced by selexipag. 
The primary clinical symptoms after oral administration of selexipag were flush, red discoloration of 
pinna/limbs/abdomen and flaccidity linked to IP receptor-dependent vasodilation and blood pressure 
decrease (at doses of > 6 mg/kg/day). Selexipag increased urine volume accompanied by a decreased 
excretion of Na and K (at doses of > 25 mg/kg/day), which might be explained by the vasodilating 
effects of selexipag which induced an increase in renal blood flow and an enhancement of urine 
production. Increased adrenal weight (at doses of ≥  25 mg/kg/day) associated with cortical 
hypertrophy and hypertrophy of the zona glomerulosa seems to be a stress-related response. At high 
oral doses (> 100 mg/kg/day), the administration of selexipag induced increased liver weight 
associated with hypertrophy of centrilobular hepatocytes and proliferation of the smooth endoplasmatic 
reticulum of hepatocytes as demonstrated in electron microscopic examinations; these findings might 
be explained by an induction of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes by selexipag. These effects might 
also be responsible for the increased thyroid weights accompanied by hyperplasia of the follicular cells 
in the thyroid (≥  25 mg/kg/day). Platelet count dose-dependently decreased at doses of ≥ 6 
mg/kg/day in males and at doses of ≥ 20 mg/kg/day in females. The Applicant was not able to provide 
a mechanistic explanation for this effect observed in rats. Due to the minor effect, the reversibility of 
the effect and the absence of effects on coagulation times or bleeding, the rat finding of decreased 
platelet counts after administration of selexipag seems to have no human relevance. Furthermore, 
decreased platelet count has also been observed after administration of other IP receptor agonists in 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report 
Page 21/117 
 
 
rat repeated-dose toxicity studies (e.g. for treprostinil). Haemorrhage in the alveoli of lungs at doses of 
> 20 mg/kg/day selexipag might be explained by the platelet-inhibitory effects of selexipag. 
Dogs were the more sensitive species compared to rats in repeated dose toxicity studies performed 
with selexipag. In juvenile dogs, the major clinical findings were related to selexipag-induced 
disturbance of intestinal motility leading to the development of intussusception with changes in stool, 
prolapse of anus and dark red discoloration in the jejunum and intussusception (jejunum), which 
manifested histologically as haemorrhagic infarction (necrosis, haemorrhage and congestion of the 
intestinal mucosa; at doses of > 2 mg/kg/day). Intussusception was the cause of death (3 animals at a 
dose of 20 mg/kg/day in the 14 day study, 2 animals at a dose of 4 mg/kg/day in the 39 week study). 
The mechanism for the development of gastrointestinal alterations induced in dogs by selexipag has 
been discussed by the Applicant. In contrast to other prostaglandins, prostacyclin (PGI2) prevents 
diarrhoea caused by other prostaglandins, PGI2 inhibits gastric acid secretion and is cytoprotective for 
the stomach and the small intestine, and the antidiarrheal activity of PGI2 may be due to its 
antipropulsive effects (Ruwart and Rush 1984). Administration of the prostacyclin analogue taprostene 
induced hypermotility of the gastrointestinal tract resulting in intestinal invagination (intussusception) 
in dogs (Wöhrmann et al. 1994). Intussusception is defined as prolapse of a proximal bowel segment 
into a distal segment and may result in luminal obstruction, mucosal congestion or infarction. 
Intussusception is more common in young dogs (< 6-8 month old; Merck Veterinary Manual), which is 
the age of affected dogs in repeated dose toxicity studies performed with selexipag. Intussusception is 
the most important cause of gastrointestinal obstruction in dogs (Mutasa et al. 1994). In humans, 
intussusception is rare in adults and mainly observed in association with cancer, but it is relatively 
common in children (Azar and Berger 1997, Duijff et al. 2007). The Applicant suggests that 
intussusception is a result of exaggerated pharmacodynamics of selexipag in dogs. The risk for humans 
to develop intussusception is considered low by the Applicant in view of the particular sensitivity of 
dogs to IP receptor agonist-induced effects on intestinal motility, the increased sensitivity of young 
dogs to develop intussusception and the safety margins for a human dose of 1600 µg b.i.d. According 
to the Applicant, no case of intestinal invagination was reported during the clinical studies with 
selexipag. 
Intussusception did not occur in mouse or rat toxicity studies. However, in our view, safety margins at 
the NOEL of 1 mg/kg/day regarding the gastrointestinal findings in dogs as obtained in the 39 week 
study, corrected for species difference in receptor potency, are very low with values of 0.1 for 
selexipag and 1 - 1.6 for ACT-333679, respectively, in relation to human exposure at a dose of 1600 
µg b.i.d.. Therefore, the possible induction of gastrointestinal disturbances denoting intestinal 
intususception (manifested as ileus or obstruction) induced by selexipag has been included as an 
important potential risk in the Risk Management Plan, and special caution is needed in the treatment of 
children, since children (and also young dogs) are more susceptible than adults to the induction of 
intussusception (Azar and Berger 1997, Duijff et al. 2007). 
The second most marked effect aside from the gastrointestinal effects observed in repeated dose 
toxicity studies in dogs performed with selexipag were bone and bone marrow alterations. These 
consisted of increased ossification of the trabeculae and periosteum and bands of fibroblasts with 
collagen fibres ("fibrosis") in the femur and sternum (at doses of > 6 mg/kg/day in the 14 day study, 
> 3 mg/kg/day in the 4 weeks study and at all doses (> 1 mg/kg/day) in the 39 weeks study). 
Furthermore, the amount of hematopoietic tissue in the bone marrow of the femur and sternum was 
affected: it decreased at doses of > 6 mg/kg/day in the 14 day study and > 3 mg/kg/day in the 4 
week study, but increased at all doses (> 1 mg/kg/day) in the 39 week study. Extramedullary 
haematopoiesis in the spleen was observed at a dose of 6 mg/kg/day in the 4 week study. In the 39 
week repeated dose toxicity study in dogs, a NOAEL could not be established for bone/bone marrow 
findings. Increased bone mass was still observed after 4 weeks of recovery in the 4-week dog toxicity 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report 
Page 22/117 
 
 
study. The increased ossification was not associated with clinical signs indicative of pain or changes in 
blood chemistry. Increased ossification was associated with changes in the bone marrow, including 
bands of fibroblasts with collagen fibres ("fibrosis") and altered appearance of the hematopoietic tissue 
in femur or sternum (either decreased or increased haematopoiesis). 
Increased ossification of femur and sternum was also reported in the juvenile dog study. In the 
juvenile study, no effects were noted on limb function or on growth measurements like tibia length and 
standing shoulder height. 
The observation that ACT-333679 was similarly active at the dog EP4 receptor (EC50 value of 18 nM) 
compared to the dog IP receptor (EC50 value of 14 nM), but was inactive at the human EP4 receptor, 
plays a central role in the assessment of human relevance of the bone findings observed in dogs. 
Therefore, in repeated dose toxicity studies performed with selexipag in dogs both IP and EP4 
receptors are stimulated (the first by both selexipag and ACT-333679, the latter by ACT-333679).  
PGE2 can activate formation of the periosteal and endocortical surface of long bones in both the rat 
and dog, which involves the recruitment and proliferation of osteo-progenitor cells present in the 
periosteum and mesenchymal cells of the marrow cavity; furthermore, prostaglandins activate 
remodelling activity on the surface of trabeculae and in the cortex of long bones indicating that 
prostaglandins are involved with increases in both bone formation (stimulation of osteoblasts) and of 
bone resorption (stimulation of osteoclastic bone resorption; review in Norrdin et al. 1990). PGE2 
increases bone mass in animals and humans; stimulation of the EP2 receptor stimulates formation, 
stimulation of the EP4 receptor stimulates resorption (and possibly formation), and stimulation of the 
FP receptor produces new trabeculae (review in Hartke and Lundy 2001). The EP4 prostanoid receptor 
is one of 4 receptor subtypes for prostaglandin E2 and belongs to the family of G protein–coupled 
receptors, is coupled to Gsa and stimulates AC activity and cAMP production, but is also associated with 
Gi, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), ß-arrestin and ß-catenin (review in Yokohama et al. 2013). 
The following observations indicate that the EP4 receptor has a major role in bone biology: the 
administration of selective EP4 receptor agonists has been demonstrated to reverse osteoporotic 
changes, enhances the bone-implant interface strength and has a synergistic effect when used with 
other bone cell targeting pharmacological agents such as BMP-2 and bisphosphonates (review in 
Pagkalos et al. 2012); PGE2 promotes both bone resorption and bone formation, and these effects are 
mediated by EP4 signalling (review in Yokohama et al. 2013); ONO-4819, which is a prostaglandin (PG) 
E2 EP4 receptor selective agonist (EP4A), accelerates BMP-induced osteoblastic differentiation of the 
pluripotent stromal cell line ST2 by stimulating the commitment for osteoblastic lineage (Nakagawa et 
al. 2007); using a selective EP4 receptor antagonist, it was demonstrated that PGE2 stimulates 
osteoblastic commitment of rat bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) via activation of the EP4 receptor 
(Shamir et al. 2004); results from studies in EP4 receptor knockout mice indicated that the EP4 
receptor resulted in an imbalance in bone resorption over formation leading to a negative bone balance 
and that the absence of the EP4 receptor decreases bone mass and impairs fracture healing in aged 
male mice, leading to the conclusion that the EP4 receptor is a positive regulator in the maintenance of 
bone mass and fracture healing (Li et al. 2005); osteoblasts and bone marrow adipocytes are derived 
from a common bone marrow mesenchymal progenitor, and a PGE2 receptor subtype 4 agonist 
stimulated bone formation at skeletal sites with hematopoietic and fatty marrow and simultaneously 
decreased fatty marrow area and the number of adipocytes in the bone marrow (Aguierre et al. 2007). 
"Fibrosis", characterized by bands of fibroblasts with collagen fibres, observed at high doses of 
selexipag administered in the repeated dose toxicity studies in dogs resembles callus tissue during the 
process of fracture healing, and local infusion of PGE2 has been demonstrated to cause stimulation of 
callus formation in rabbits (Keller et al. 1993). Therefore, "fibrosis" was induced by high doses of 
selexipag via activation of the EP4 receptor and seems to be similar to bone fracture healing.

The observation that in the repeated dose toxicity studies performed in dogs with selexipag the 
amount of haematopoietic tissue in the bone marrow of the femur and sternum was affected (either 
increased or decreased) is in line with the finding that PGE2 has both stimulatory and inhibitory effects 
on the differentiation of haematopoietic progenitors. 
The following observations indicate that PGE2 has inhibitory effects on the differentiation of 
haematopoietic progenitors: PGE1 and PGE2 inhibit the proliferation of committed myeloid stem cells 
(Kurland et al. 1978); prostaglandins inhibit the in-vitro growth of erythroid progenitor cells obtained 
from patients with chronic renal failure (Taniguchi et al. 1989); prostaglandin inhibitors may have a 
role in combination with hematopoietic growth factors in accelerating hematopoietic recovery following 
cytoreductive chemotherapy (O´Reilly and Gamelli 1990); the in vivo administration of IL-1 results in 
neutrophilia and generation of myelopoietic suppressive effects mediated by cyclooxygenase pathway 
products; blockade of PG synthesis abrogates the myelopoietic suppressive effects associated with IL-1 
administration and optimizes its myelopoietic stimulatory capacity (Pelus 1989); intravenous injection 
of PGE2 resulted in the suppression of nucleated bone marrow and splenic cellularity, total resident 
nucleated peritoneal cells and the number of granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells (Gentile et al. 
1983). 
However, the following observations indicate that PGE2 has also stimulatory effects on the 
differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors: using a murine bone marrow stem cell assay, it was 
demonstrated that lipoxygenase products stimulate myeloid colony formation and lymphoid stem cell 
proliferation (Vore et al. 1989); in the bone marrow, PGE2 expands hematopoietic stem cells and 
affects the differentiation of haematopoietic progenitors, and PGE2 treatment expands hematopoietic 
stem cells with no negative impact on haematopoietic progenitors (Frisch et al. 2009); PGE2 regulates 
hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) activity and the EP4 receptor was identified as the key 
receptor for PGE2-mediated regulation of HSPCs via stimulation of PKA and ß-catenin (Ikushima et al. 
2013). Furthermore, two mechanisms of prostanoid activation of erythropoiesis have been proposed: 
1. Activation of the erythroid progenitor cells in the bone marrow by PGE2 and PGD 2 to increase the 
responsiveness of erythroid cells to erythropoietin, and 2. stimulation of renal erythropoietin 
production by hypoxia via the prostacyclin pathway (review in Fisher and Hagiwara 1984). 
In conclusion, as metabolite ACT-333679 is similarly active on both IP and EP4 receptors from dogs, 
the bone/ bone marrow effects in dogs induced by selexipag in the repeated dose toxicity studies 
might be related to effects of ACT-333679 on the EP4 receptor. Because both selexipag and its 
metabolite ACT-333679 have no affinity for the human EP4 receptor, the bone/bone marrow effects 
induced by selexipag in dogs; this effect is species-specific and, therefore, not relevant to humans.  
As observed in rats, decreased platelet counts (at doses of > 6 mg/kg/day) have been found in dogs. 
This effect might be IP receptor mediated because in anaesthetized dogs the infusion of prostacyclin 
has been demonstrated to produce splenic dilation that leads via blood pooling to a decrease in 
circulating blood cell concentrations (Noguchi et al. 2006). For the assessment of possible effects of 
selexipag on the bone marrow, see also the clinical assessment of questions 131 and 132. 
Reduced urinary excretions of Na, K and Cl (at doses of > 6 mg/kg/day) induced by selexipag might be 
explained by the vasodilating effects of selexipag. 
Toxicokinetic evaluation of repeated-dose studies 
Binding of both unchanged selexipag and its metabolite ACT-333679 in rat, dog, monkey, and man 
sera was in a range between 97–99%, and equilibrium dialysis in mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, monkey, and 
man plasma gave free fractions of 0.3-0.6% for selexipag and 0.4-0.8% for ACT-333679. Therefore, 
both selexipag and ACT-333679 exhibited no marked species differences in the extent of serum protein 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report 
Page 24/117 
 
 
binding among rats, dogs, monkeys and humans, and no correction of the exposure ratios for plasma 
protein binding is necessary. 
However, it should be taken into account that both selexipag and ACT-333679 have species differences 
at the target IP receptor, with sensitivity in the order human > rat > dog (the EC50 values for free 
substances at the human, rat and dog IP receptors were 4, 170 and 1100 nM for selexipag, 
respectively, and 0.17, 3.1 and 14 nM for metabolite ACT-333679, respectively). When the exposure 
ratios at the NOAEL of 6 mg/kg/day in rats and at the LOEL of 1 mg/kg/day in dogs are corrected for 
the species-dependent EC50 values at the IP receptor, values for the exposure ratios for rats at the 
NOAEL obtained in the 26 week study are 0.04 - 0.08 for selexipag and 0.6 - 1.4 for ACT-333679, and 
for dogs at the LOEL obtained in the 39 week study are 0.1 for selexipag and 1 - 1.6 for ACT-333679, 
respectively. 
Genotoxicity 
A standard battery of genotoxicity test was performed with selexipag and the active metabolite ACT-
333679. In conclusion, selexipag and its metabolite ACT-333679 were tested in vitro in AMES and 
chromosome aberration assays and in vivo in mouse bone marrow micronucleus and rat liver Comet 
assays with no biologically relevant adverse observations. 
Carcinogenicity 
Two GLP-conform carcinogenicity studies were performed in B6CF1/Crlj mice and SD rats. 
In the mouse study there was no treatment-related increase in either number of tumours or tumour 
bearing animals in either sex. Slightly higher incidence of thyroid follicular cell tumours (adenoma and 
carcinoma) were observed in 2 males each in the 250 and 500 mg/kg groups and in 3 females in the 
500 mg/kg group, although there were no statistically significant differences in either trend analysis or 
pairwise comparison between the control and any dose group. This was paralleled by increased 
incidence and severity of hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the follicular cells. Follicular cell adenoma was 
also observed in 1 female each at doses of 125 and 250 mg/kg, respectively. A treatment related 
effect cannot be completely excluded, since increased incidence and severity of 
hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the follicular cells were also observed in these groups. Safety margins for 
neoplastic findings at the NOEL of 125 mg/kg/day of 172-fold for selexipag and 54-fold for ACT-
333679 were calculated towards AUC exposure levels at the clinical dose of 1600 µg b.i.d. 
A mechanistic study performed in mice (T-13.030) revealed that selexipag induces the expression and 
activity of hepatic metabolic enzymes and plasma levels of T3 and TSH, which explains a continuous 
stimulation of the thyroid and subsequent hyperplasia and adenoma. This mechanism is rodent specific 
(Klaassen 2001, De Sandro 1991, Hood 1999]. Even so an increase in TRH and prolactin levels have 
not directly been demonstrated in mice treated with selexipag, the mechanistic study implies a 
dysregulation of the hormonal axis of the thyroid induced by liver enzyme induction and compensatory 
increases in TSH and TRH. Given the fact that rodents are more susceptible to thyroid hormone 
imbalances (Capen 1996) and these mechanisms are often rodent specific (Klaassen 2001, De Sandro 
1991, Hood 1999) and hepatic enzyme induction has not been observed in clinical trials, these findings 
are not of toxicological concern. 
In female mice ovarian corpora luteal hypertrophy, mammary gland lobular hyperplasia, and vagina 
mucification was observed at doses of ≥  125 mg/kg (low dose) which hint to elevated levels of 
prolactin. Yamada et al. (2006) have shown that thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) knock-out mice 
display slightly reduced prolactin levels; prolactin suppression was more pronounced during lactation in 
knock-out animals. This indicates that increased TRH levels result in increased prolactin levels 
(reviewed in Ben-Jonathan N et al 2008). Increased TRH levels might be triggered by hepatic 
microsomal enzyme induction and is in line with observed increased centrilobular hepatocellular 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report 
Page 25/117 
 
 
hypertrophy at doses of ≥  125 mg/kg. Enzyme induction in mouse livers by selexipag has been 
studied in the mechanistic study (T-13.030) and led to compensatory increased T3 and TSH levels in 
treated mice. However, TRH levels have not been measured in this study but are likely to be 
compensatory elevated.  
The incidence of fibro-osseous lesions increased in high-dose males. This lesion frequently occurred in 
female mice in the control and all treatment groups, indicating that it is a background finding in aging 
animals. The mechanism of these findings in high-dose males is unclear, however occurred at 
sufficiently high safety margins (NOAEL 250 mg/kg) of > 100-fold for selexipag and ACT-333679, 
respectively. 
In the rat study there were no effects of selexipag on survival rate of males. A statistically significant 
trend of an increase in the survival rate with increasing dose levels was observed in females, and the 
survival rate of the 100 mg/kg group was significantly higher than that of the control group.  
There was no treatment-related increase in either number of tumours or tumour bearing animals in 
either sex. A decrease in the number of benign tumours was observed in males in the 30 and 100 
mg/kg groups. Decreases in the total number of tumours, number of malignant tumour bearing 
animals and number of multiple tumour bearing animals were observed in males in the 100 mg/kg 
group. 
Marginally increased incidence of Leydig cell tumour was observed in the 100 mg/kg group, and 
statistically significant positive trend was noted (rare tumour, p<0.025); however, there was no 
statistical significance in pairwise comparison between the control and 100 mg/kg groups. Additionally, 
slightly higher incidence in focal hyperplasia of Leydig cells was observed in this group. The tumour 
incidence of the 100 mg/kg group (5/60 animals, 8%) was marginally higher than that of historical 
data (0 to 4% in the incidence). In addition, there was no statistically significant positive trend in 
incidence of Leydig cell tumour in the control, 10 and 30 mg/kg groups. 
In the pituitary, increased incidence of anterior adenoma was observed in males in the 10 mg/kg group 
with statistical significance (common tumour, p<0.01). However, it was not considered to be treatment 
related, since it was not dose-related. 
Mechanistic studies performed with cultured rat Leydig cells (T-11.295) and in vivo in rats (T-11.460) 
gave no conclusive explanation for the occurrence of Leydig cell adenoma in the rat carcinogenicity 
study. Leydig cell hyperplasia and subsequent adenoma formation is usually a proliferative response to 
increased testosterone, LH and/or prolactin levels in rats (reviewed in Cook JC 1999). In the in vitro 
study with cultured Leydig cells, selexipag/ACT-333679 increased testosterone excretion at relevant 
concentrations close to the Cmax in the rat carcinogenicity study. However, testosterone, LH and 
prolactin levels were decreased in the in vivo mechanistic study using similarly high doses (up to 150 
mg/kg/day). The reason for the decrease is not clear and cannot explain adenoma formation.   
To this end rats are more sensitive in their proliferative response to LH and their sensitivity to 
chemically induced Leydig cell tumours (Prentice 1995 and Cook 1999). Safety margins at the NOEL of 
30 mg/kg/day based on AUC values are 19-fold for selexipag and 92-fold for ACT-333679 at the 
clinical dose of 1600 µg selexipag b.i.d.. Taken together, due to the rat specific mechanism and the 
high safety margins, Leydig cell tumours are not expected to occur in humans at the anticipated 
maximum recommended human dose of 1600 µg b.i.d. 
At ≥  30mg/kg/day (NOAEL 10 mg/kg/day) eye dilation and meandering (tortuosity) of the retinal 
arterioles were observed in the rat carcinogenicity which were not accompanied by histological lesions. 
Ophthalmological findings were not observed in the other (shorter) repeat-dose toxicity studies. 
Prostaglandins and prostacyclins have been described to dilate retinal arterioles and increase retinal 
and choroidal blood flow via IP and EP2 receptors (Mori 2007a, Mori 2007b). Safety margins of 5.52-
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report 
Page 26/117 
 
 
fold and 34.5-fold for selexipag and ACT-333679 towards human exposure at 1600 µg b.i.d., 
respectively, were calculated. As ophthalmological findings are probably an exaggerated 
pharmacological effect mediated via the IP receptor, a correction factor of 29 for selexipag (EC50: 250 
nM for human, 7200 nM for rat) and 18 for ACT-333679 (EC50 at IP receptor: 6.1 nM for human, 110 
nM for rat) should be applied. This results in safety margins of 0.2x and 2x for selexipag and ACT-
333679, respectively. Therefore, ophthalmic findings might be of relevance for humans. However, 
ophthalmological assessments have been implemented in phase 2 and phase 3 clinical studies. No 
treatment-related findings of retinal vascular tortuosity by using fundus photography were observed. 
Nevertheless, due to the low safety margins and limited long-term data in humans, ophthalmological 
effects associated with retinal vascular system have been included as an important risk in the Risk 
Management Plan.  
Various non-neoplastic findings were observed in the mouse and rat carcinogenicity studies. Alterations 
of the liver, thyroid and adrenal gland are consistent with those found in general toxicity studies. 
Adaptive changes (hyperplasia or atrophy) in the thymus, fibro-osseous lesion in the femur, 
erosion/ulcer, adhesion with surrounding tissues and/or mucosal regeneration in the glandular stomach 
and hyperplasia of acinar cells in the pancreas were observed in mice and rats. Additionally, treatment-
related lesions in the female reproductive system (hypertrophy of corpora lutea, vaginal mucification, 
lobular hyperplasia in mammary glands), in the sublingual gland (hypertrophy/atrophy of the acinar 
cells), in the intestine/duodenum (perforation), in the spleen (increased pigment in the red pulp and 
atrophy) and in the kidney (tubular hypertrophy of the papilla, eosinophilic droplet in papillary 
epithelium, tubular basophilia in the cortex, tubular hypertrophy in outer medulla, hyperplasia of the 
papillary epithelium, tubular regeneration and urinary cast) were found in mice. Finally, dilation and 
tortuosity of retinal arterioles were observed only in rats at the end of the study. 
The Applicant explained that the ovarian corpora lutea hypertrophy, mammary gland lobular 
hyperplasia, and vagina mucification could be a consequence of an elevated prolactin level that could 
be induced by a multistep process, starting with hepatic microsomal enzyme induction. Although these 
alterations could be a consequence of elevated prolactin levels as the Applicant stated, hormonal 
imbalance (increments in levels of prolactin and/or TRH and decrement in T3 levels) associated with 
hypertrophy of ovarian corpora lutea that could produce a shift towards a progesterone-like phase of 
the normal oestrus cycle and lead to vagina mucification have not been reported in animals treated 
with selexipag. Moreover, decrements in prolactin levels were reported in male rats after selexipag 
administration.  
Reproductive and Developmental Toxicology 
The reproductive and developmental toxicity of selexipag was studied according to ICH-S5 in GLP-
compliant studies in the rat and rabbit. During these studies standard parameters were assessed.  
Toxicokinetic parameters were obtained from satellite animals. Pregnant rats showed a slightly higher 
exposure towards selexipag and ATC-333679 compared to non-pregnant rats for the highest dose 
group of 20 mg/kg bw. 
In the study on fertility and early embryonic development in the rat, time until copulation was 
significantly longer in the high dose group probably due to impaired oestrus of females. Although 
fertility index and other female reproductive parameters were not affected, general effects on the 
female reproductive system cannot be excluded.  
An embryotoxicity study was performed in the rat, and the rabbit was chosen as non-rodent species 
for the second embryotoxicity study. An altogether higher incidence for visceral anomalies was 
observed in the rat study. However, the overall incidence was reported to be within the historical 
control range and there was no significant difference in the incidence of any abnormality between the

control and high-dose group. In the rabbit study, retrocarval ureter was observed with higher incidence 
in the high dose compared to the control group, but was also shown to be within the historical control 
range of the study facility. Receptor potency studies provided by the applicant showed much lower 
potency of selexipag and ACT-333679 at the rat and rabbit IP-receptor compared to the human 
receptor (refer to the pharmacology section above). Therefore, IP receptor mediated effects on 
reproduction will probably not become evident during the reproductive toxicity studies since exposure 
margins adapted to IP-receptor potency are usually below human therapeutic exposures. In 
conclusion, selexipag did not show any teratogenic effects in the studies on embryo-fetal development. 
Exposure margins, based on total exposure, were about 13-times for selexipag and 46-times for ACT-
333679 towards human therapeutic exposures.   
In the pre/-postnatal development study performed in the rat, a delay in the cleavage of the 
balanopreputial gland in males of the F1 generation was observed for all dose groups compared to 
controls. However, otherwise functional development and reproductive performance of the F1 
generation was not affected. 
Studies in which the offspring (juvenile animals) are dosed and/or further evaluated  
Based on a dose-range finding study, a pivotal GLP compliant juvenile toxicity study was performed in 
Beagle dogs. Dogs were 28 days of age at the beginning of the study. 
In juvenile dogs, selexipag exposure was 2- to 3- fold lower than in adult animals at comparable doses 
and remained constant after repeated dosing. Exposure towards ACT-333679 was only comparable to 
adult exposure at the first day of dosing and decreased towards the end of the treatment period. 
Like in the repeat-dose toxicity studies in adult dogs, mortality due to intussusception was observed in 
juvenile animals. Other treatment-related changes mainly consisted of increased thickness of the 
compact bone of the femoral shaft with increased numbers/thickness of trabeculae in the medullary 
cavity which were noted in a time- and dose-related pattern. Similar bone effects and haematopoietic 
hypercellularity were reported from the repeat-dose studies in adult dogs and were discussed to be 
mediated through ACT-333579 species specific activation of the dog EP4 receptor. (see above) 
A dose-dependent delay in the closure of the femoral and/or tibia epiphyseal growth plate was 
observed in animals sacrificed at week 39, a finding which could affect growth of the skeleton. A 
NOAEL for bone effects was not established. Bone effects as well as intestinal invagination have to be 
carefully discussed as soon as selexipag will be considered for the treatment of the paediatric 
population. Sexual maturation was also observed to be delayed in female dogs. It could be shown that 
this delay was not due to a direct involvement of prostacyclin in uterine function, but was rather due to 
toxicity of selexipag leading to low food consumption and a massive reduction in body weight gain and 
low ovary and uterus weights. In conclusion, bone and intestinal effects are described in the SmPC 
(Section 5.3). Reduced food consumption and consecutive effects were observed only at very high 
doses so that the relevance is regarded low and inclusion in the SmPC is not warranted. 
Local Tolerance 
In rabbits after intravenous and paravenous application of selexipag, no local irritation was observed. 
Other toxicity studies 
All tested impurities were negative for revertant colonies in the performed Ames tests and can be 
considered as non-mutagenic.

2.3.5 Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The predicted concentration for surface water is correct based on the applicant’s assumption of the 
number of patients. In addition, in 2015, the prevalence at orphan.net has even been reduced to 
1.5/1,000,000. The assessor agrees that the PEC surface water is clearly below the action limit. 
The test on the determination of the partition coefficient of ACT-293987 according to OECD 107 is valid 
and plausible. It is agreed that no Phase I PBT assessment is necessary. The CHMP also agrees with 
the applicant’s conclusion that there are no indications requiring an experimental Phase II assessment 
irrespective of the action limit.

In conclusion, the environmental risk assessment of selexipag ends in Phase I because the predicted 
concentration in surface water is lower than 0.01 µg/l and the log Dow is lower than 4.5. 
Therefore selexipag is not expected to pose a risk for the environment. 
2.3.6 Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Upon request, the Applicant has calculated the free concentrations of selexipag/ACT-333679 in in-vitro 
functional assays and in in-vitro pharmacokinetic interaction studies and compared these values to the 
free therapeutically effective plasma concentrations of both selexipag (0.12 nM) and ACT-333679 (0.28 
nM) in order to assess the clinical relevance of the observed findings. The free EC50/IC50 values for 
selexipag and ACT-333679 shift to markedly lower values (to the low nanomolar range for selexipag 
and to the picomolar range for ACT-333679). As a consequence of these re-calculations, the Applicant 
supports the suggestion that there are spare IP receptors, since the IC50/EC50 values for free selexipag 
and ACT-333679 are lower compared to the Ki values obtained in binding experiments. The re-
calculated free EC50/IC50 values for selexipag and ACT-333679 correlate with selexipag and ACT-
333679 free peak plasma concentrations of 0.12 nM and 0.28 nM, respectively, at 1600 µg b.i.d. in 
humans.  
The existence of differences in spare IP receptors together with differences in the degrees of signal 
amplification of the IP receptor signaling cascade can explain the different potencies of selexipag/ACT-
333679 in functional assays performed in different in-vitro test systems. 
Mice were used in the carcinogenicity studies and rabbits in the reproductive and developmental 
toxicity studies performed with selexipag. In order to give an explanation for the findings observed in 
mouse carcinogenicity studies and in the rabbit reproductive and developmental toxicity studies, the 
Applicant provided results from a new study in which in vitro potencies (EC50 values), as measured by 
cAMP accumulation, were determined in recombinant cells expressing similar levels of the mouse,

rabbit, or human IP receptor. The rabbit and mouse IP-receptors showed 61- and 69-fold lower 
potencies for selexipag and 74- and 56-fold lower potencies for ACT-333679, respectively. For any 
pharmacological effect mediated via the IP receptor occurring in mouse and rabbit studies, correction 
factors for differences in potencies should be applied for the calculation of safety margins. Taking the 
correction factors for IP-receptor potency into account, these safety margins diminish to values below 
human therapeutic exposures. However, adverse effects in the mouse carcinogenicity study and the 
rabbit reproductive toxicology studies are probably not mediated via the IP receptor  
Nevertheless, a general statement regarding those differences in IP receptor potency in animals used 
for toxicity assessment compared to humans has been included into section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
IP prostacyclin receptor agonists have the potential to induce neurogenic pain, and headache, pain, 
arthralgia, myalgia, abdominal pain, pain in jaw and pain in extremities are mentioned in the SmPC 
under section 4.8 undesirable effects. 
Based on the re-calculated free concentrations of selexipag and ACT-333679 in the in-vitro 
pharmacokinetic interaction studies, selexipag and its metabolite do not seem to have any relevant 
inhibitory potential on CYP P450 enzymes, on transport proteins and on BCRP. However, an induction 
of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 by selexipag in the intestine cannot be excluded. This is therefore mentioned in 
the SmPC under section 4.5. 
In repeated-dose toxicity studies performed in rats and dogs, platelet count dose-dependently 
decreased. The Applicant could not able to provide a mechanistic explanation for this effect observed in 
rats. Nevertheless due to the small magnitude of the effect, its reversibility and the absence of effects 
on coagulation times or bleeding, the rat finding of decreased platelet counts after administration of 
selexipag has no human relevance; furthermore, decreased platelet count has also been observed after 
administration of other IP receptor agonists in rat repeated-dose toxicity studies (e.g. for treprostinil). 
The decreased platelet counts observed in dogs after administration of selexipag might be IP receptor 
mediated because in anaesthetized dogs the infusion of prostacyclin has been demonstrated to 
produce splenic dilation that leads via blood pooling to a decrease in circulating blood cell 
concentrations. In conclusion, decreased platelet counts observed in repeated-dose toxicity studies 
performed in rats and dogs do not seem to be of therapeutic relevance. 
Reproductive toxicity of selexipag was studied according to ICH-S5 in the rat and in the rabbit. 
Receptor binding studies showed a much lower potency for selexipag and ATC-333679 at the rat and 
rabbit IP receptor compared to the human receptor. Therefore, IP mediated effects will probably not 
become evident during the reproductive toxicity studies because exposures adapted for IP receptor 
potency are usually below human therapeutic exposures. The margins adapted for differences in 
receptor potencies are provided in section 4.6 of the SmPC. 
In the fertility study performed in rats, estrus cycles were prolonged increasing the time until 
copulation in the high dose group. Lower food consumption was observed for those dams, but no 
changes in body weights. Therefore, lower maternal body weight was the cause of these findings. The 
observation of prolonged oestrus cycle is mentioned in sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC.  
In the embryo-fetal development study in the rabbit, retrocaval ureter was observed with a higher 
incidence in the high dose compared to the control group. Historical control data covering different 
time frames of the study facility showed that the incidences were within the historical control range. 
The same could be shown for the higher incidence of visceral anomalies, in general, observed for the 
high dose group of the rat embryotoxicity study. Accordingly, selexipag did not show any teratogenic 
effects in the studies on embryo-fetal development with exposure margins, based on total exposures, 
of approximately 13-times for selexipag and 46-times for ACT-333678, respectively.

In the juvenile toxicity study performed in the dog, a delay in sexual maturation in female beagle dogs 
was observed. It could be shown that this delay was not due to a direct involvement of prostacyclin in 
uterine  function,  but  was  rather  due  to  toxicity  of  selexipag  leading  to  low  food  consumption  and  a 
massive reduction in body weight gain and low ovary and uterus weights. A delay in the closure of the 
femoral and/or tibia epiphyseal growth plate was observed in animals sacrificed at week 39, a finding 
which  could  affect  growth  of  the  skeleton.  The  applicant  argues  that  the  distribution  of  animals  with 
closed  versus  open  growth  plates  is  still  within  the  normal  range.  However,  effects  on  the  closure  of 
growth plates were clearly dose dependent. A NOAEL for bone effects was not established. A respective 
statement is mentioned in section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
2.3.7 Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
From a non-clinical point of view, a Marketing Authorization for selexipag can be granted. Amendments 
to sections 4.5, 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC have been implemented as required during the assessment.  
In conclusion, the SmPC reflects the non clinical finding of relevance for the prescriber.

2.4.2 Pharmacokinetics 
Selexipag is an orally available, selective non-prostanoid agonist of the prostacyclin (IP) receptor. 
Selexipag and its active metabolite, ACT-333679, are active at the IP receptor. ACT-333679 has a 13-
fold higher affinity than selexipag for the human IP receptor. It is present at 3- to 4-fold higher levels 
than the parent drug at steady-state in humans. ACT-333679 is the major contributor to the efficacy of 
selexipag. 
In total, 12 studies were preformed that were classified as PK-studies. In addition, PK was measured in 
PD and phase III studies. 
Methods 
Bioanalytical methods studies (high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass 
spectrometry [LC-MS/MS]) enabled measurement of selexipag and ACT-333679 concentrations in 
human plasma samples. These methods were sensitive, precise, and linear in the concentration range 
of 0.01–20.00 ng/mL for both selexipag and ACT-333679. Five method validation reports were 
provided. The two most frequently used methods were cross validated. Standard PK parameters and 
statistical analyses were used. 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report 
Page 32/117 
 
 
 
Absorption 
An intravenous (i.v.) formulation of selexipag, has been developed and an absolute bioavailability 
study has been conducted (AC-065-110). The geometric mean (90% CI) absolute bioavailability 
calculated for selexipag is 0.49 (0.43, 0.57). 
Relative bioavailability after oral administration has been properly characterized. PK results with 
solution (study PS003) and tablet (study QGUY/2006/NS-304/01) were found to be comparable. 
The Applicant has not investigated the absorption site of selexipag. However, based on surface-to-
volume characteristics and pH (around 8), most of the absorption of selexipag (freely soluble at pH 8) 
is anticipated to occur in the duodenum. 
Following single-dose administration (100 to 800 µg), the PK profile of selexipag is characterized by 
rapid absorption with Cmax achieved within 1 h after drug administration and a t1/2 of approximately 
0.8–2.5 h. The active metabolite, ACT 333679, is formed rapidly and eliminated with a t 1/2 of 
approximately 6–13 h.  
An in vitro study was conducted to compare the dissolution profiles of 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200, 
1400, and 1600 μg film-coated tablets with that of the dose strength of 200 μg, in dissolution media of 
four different pH values: 1.2, 4.5, 5.5, and 6.8. When the dissolution profile of multiple tablets of the 
200 µg dose was compared to that of a single tablet of higher strengths (e.g., 2 × 200 µg tablets vs 1 
× 400 µg tablet), the f2 value was above 50 for all dose strengths and at all dissolution pH values. In 
addition, bioequivalence between 1 tablet of 1600 μg and 8 tablets of 200 μg selexipag was 
demonstrated in study AC-065-108 (figure 3).

In the presence of food, median time to reach maximum plasma concentration (tmax) of both selexipag 
and ACT-333679 was delayed (2.75 and 4.0 h, respectively) compared to in the absence of food (1.0 
and 2.5 h, respectively). C max of selexipag decreased by 35% whereas the area under the plasma 
concentration-time curve from 0 to infinity (AUC0-∞) numerically increased by approximately 10% in 
the presence of food. Cmax and AUC0-∞ of ACT-333679 decreased by 48 and 27%, respectively, in the 
presence of food (figure 4).

12) (study QGUY/2006/NS304/-01 Part B) 
Distribution 
In vitro experiments showed that selexipag and ACT-333679 are highly bound to plasma proteins (> 
99%), which was confirmed in phase 1 studies. Partitioning studies with selexipag and ACT-333679 
indicated little or no binding of either compound to blood cells. 
The geometric mean (95% CI) volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss) of selexipag is 11.73 L 
(95% CI 10.55, 13.04; results from study AC-065-110), which is comparable to the volume of 
extracellular fluid (plasma plus interstitial fluid, around 15 L). This indicates that the distribution is 
limited mainly to the extracellular fluid and that selexipag does not accumulate in tissues. 
Preclinical data indicate that selexipag and ACT-333679 permeate well through cell membranes and 
tissue distribution is mainly driven by passive diffusion. 
Metabolism 
Based on nonclinical findings, selexipag undergoes enzymatic hydrolysis by CES1 in the liver, to yield 
the active metabolite ACT-333679. Investigations in human liver microsomes (HLM) and with 
recombinant cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes indicate that the UGT enzymes UGT1A3 and UGT2B7 
contribute 42% to the metabolism of ACT-333679, while CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 contribute to 46% and 
12%, respectively. 
Elimination 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report 
Page 34/117 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In a human ADME study with 14C selexipag (study 186933), approximately 93% of radioactive drug 
material was eliminated in faeces at 168 h post-dose, none in the form of unchanged selexipag. A 
number of metabolites, including ACT-333679 (approximately 9–23%), were recovered in the faeces, 
indicating extensive metabolism of selexipag prior to biliary excretion. 
ACT-333679 has the potential to undergo enterohepatic recirculation, but its extent is limited by the 
small amount of ACT-333679 present in bile. 
Renal excretion was shown to be a minor route of elimination. 
Dose proportionality and time dependency 
Selexipag and ACT-333679 showed a dose-proportional increase in AUC and C max after multiple-dose 
administration in healthy subjects. After multiple dosing (400 to 1800 μg b.i.d), steady-state 
conditions of selexipag and ACT-333679 were achieved within 3 days. Morning trough concentrations 
of both selexipag and ACT-333679 were somewhat higher than evening trough concentrations, which 
is thought to be due to the increased blood circulation and resulting increased metabolism during the 
day compared to the night, affecting the clearance of selexipag and ACT-333679. No accumulation of 
selexipag or ACT-333679 was observed. 
Figure 5: Arithmetic mean plasma concentration-time profiles of selexipag (ACT-293987) and ACT-
333679 after multiple (Day 3) oral administrations of different dose levels of ACT-293987 in healthy 
male subjects (study AC-065-101) 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
The intra-subject CVs of selexipag and ACT-333679 were about 25 % for AUCτ and Cmax,ss. The inter-
subject CVs of selexipag and ACT-333679 were about 40 % for AUCτ and Cmax,ss. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Exposure to selexipag and ACT 333679 were estimated to be 30% and 20%, respectively, higher in 
patients with PAH or CTEPH compared with healthy subjects. 
Special populations 
Gender, race and age are of minor importance for selexipag and ACT-333679 pharmacokinetics.  
Body weight was identified as significant covariate for the volume of distribution as well as for drug 
exposure and clearance of selexipag and ACT-333679. 
In the PK Study AC-065-105, the plasma concentrations of selexipag (~1.7-fold) and ACT-333679 
(~1.5-fold) were higher in subjects with severe renal function impairment compared to healthy 
subjects (patients with mild or moderate renal impairment were not investigated). On the other hand, 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report 
Page 35/117 
 
 
 
 
 
in the confirmatory study AC-065A302 065A302/GRIPHON, CrCl was not identified as a significant 
covariate towards the PK of selexipag and ACT-333679. 
In PK study AC-065-104, the exposure to selexipag generally increased with the severity of hepatic 
impairment. When compared to healthy subjects, the plasma concentrations of selexipag in subjects 
with mild hepatic impairment increased about 2-fold. Plasma concentrations of ACT-333679 and 
derived PK parameters were comparable with those for healthy subjects, except for t1/2 (6.5 versus 
12.6 h). 
Plasma selexipag concentrations were markedly higher in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment 
(more than 4-fold increase in AUC0-∞). Median t max (6.0 h) and mean t 1/2 (15.9 h) of ACT-333679 
were longer in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects (4.0 h and 
12.6 h, respectively). Overall, this resulted in a 2.2-fold increase in exposure (AUC0-∞) to ACT-333679 
in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects. Only 2 subjects with 
severe hepatic impairment receiving a lower dose (200 vs 400 μg) were included and therefore, 
conclusions in this special population are limited. In study AC-065A302/GRIPHON, ALT and AST at 
baseline were not identified as significant covariates towards the PK of selexipag and ACT-333679. 
However, total bilirubin at baseline was identified as significant covariate for selexipag clearance.  
The list of studies performed in elderly is detailed below. Age is of minor importance for selexipag and 
ACT-333679 pharmacokinetics.

not treated. Open-label extension studies are not included as patients would be counted more than once. 
Paediatric population 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report 
Page 36/117 
 
 
 
To date, no patients younger than 18 years have been treated with selexipag. The Applicant does not 
apply for use of selexipag in children or adolescents. 
Interactions 
Based on in vitro studies, the metabolism of selexipag was mostly driven by initial hydrolysis to the 
major metabolite ACT-333679, catalysed by hepatic CES1 in humans. No clinically relevant inhibition of 
CES1 by medicinal products has been reported. 
The transformation of selexipag to other metabolites was catalysed by CYP2C8, CYP3A4, and CYP1A2. 
The UGT enzymes UGT1A3 and UGT2B7 contribute 42% to the metabolism of ACT-333679, while 
CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 contribute to 46% and 12%, respectively. 
Selexipag and its active metabolite affecting the exposure of the patient to other drugs 
The potential of selexipag and its metabolite, ACT-333679, to elicit CYP-mediated drug-drug-
interactions (DDIs) was studied in vitro using human hepatic microsomes and CYP isoform-specific 
marker transformations. The lowest derived half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 3.6 µM 
(selexipag on CYP2C8). The mean peak plasma concentrations of selexipag and ACT-333679 in human 
were 19.8 ng/mL and 28.7 ng/mL, i.e., about 0.04 μM and 0.07 μM, respectively. Although both 
compounds have shown an inhibitory potential against CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 activity in vitro, their 
potential for CYP-mediated DDIs appears negligible in light of the low unbound concentration of both 
selexipag and its metabolite, ACT-333679, in human plasma. However, assuming a luminal selexipag 
concentration of 1.3 µM and a free selexipag concentration in enterocytes of 8 nM, clinically relevant 
induction of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 in the gut cannot be excluded. 
Drugs affecting the exposure of the patient to selexipag and its active metabolite 
Study QGUY/2006/NS304/-01 Part D was performed to investigate the potential PK (and PD) 
interactions between selexipag and warfarin in healthy male subjects. The geometric mean ratios 
(selexipag + warfarin vs selexipag alone) and their 90% CIs for AUCτ of selexipag (400 µg) and for 
AUCτ and Cmax of ACT-333679 were within the bioequivalence range of 0.8 to 1.25. The lower 
boundary of the 90% CI for Cmax was 0.77 (geometric mean ratio 0.94). Visual inspection of mean 
morning trough plasma concentrations of selexipag and ACT-333679 before (on Days 5–6) and after 
single dose administration of warfarin (measured on Days 9–11) showed that co-administration of 
warfarin on Day 8 had minor effect on the trough concentrations of selexipag and ACT-333679 at 
steady-state. 
In study AC-065-109 (a randomized, two-treatment, two-period crossover study), the effects of 
multiple doses of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra) on the PK of selexipag (administered as a single 400 μg 
dose) and ACT-333679 were evaluated. The study was performed as selexipag and ACT-333679 have 
been identified in vitro as substrates of OATP transporters (OATP1B1 and OATP1B3) and lopinavir and 
ritonavir are inhibitors of these transporters. In addition, lopinavir/ritonavir is known to be a strong 
inhibitor of CYP3A4 and an inhibitor of P-gp. Plasma concentrations of selexipag were higher (almost 2-
fold) in the presence of lopinavir/ritonavir than when it was administered alone. For ACT-333679, in 
the presence of lopinavir/ritonavir, Cmax and AUC0-∞ were 1.3- and 1.1-fold higher, respectively. The 
results are adequately described in the SmPC. 
Of note, no clinical DDI study was performed with a strong inhibitor of CYP2C8 (gemfibrozil), an 
inhibitor of UGTs (valproic acid), or an inducer of CYP2C8 and UGTs (rifampicin).

2.4.3 Pharmacodynamics 
The clinical pharmacology data come from studies in healthy volunteers. The effect of selexipag and its 
metabolite on platelet aggregation, coagulation parameters, bone metabolism, cardiac repolarisation, 
and in-vivo drug-drug interactions was evaluated. Additionally, the phototoxic potential of selexipag 
was investigated. 
Prostacyclin (PGI2) is a member of the prostaglandin family, which are endogenous, oxygenated fatty 
acid metabolites deriving from arachidonic acid. A dysregulation of the PGI2 pathway has been 
observed in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension and in animal models of hypoxic pulmonary 
hypertension. Prostacyclin is a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation. For example, 
the binding of PGI2 to the IP receptor, a G-protein coupled receptor on the surface of vascular smooth 
muscle cells, triggers an increase of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which leads 
to relaxation of vascular smooth muscle cells, and vasodilation of the pulmonary arteries. In this 
manner prostacyclin can counteract the vasoconstrictor activity of thromboxane and endothelin. 
Selexipag acts as a selective, orally bioavailable, non-prostanoid IP receptor agonist. Selexipag 
undergoes an enzymatic hydrolysis of the sulfonamide by carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) in the liver, to 
yield the active metabolite ACT-333679. ACT-333679 has a 13-fold higher affinity than selexipag for 
the human IP receptor and it is at least 16-fold more potent than selexipag in cellular systems. In vitro 
experiments measuring cellular shape change using human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells 
showed that ACT-333679 is 37-fold more potent than selexipag in activating the human IP receptor. 
ACT-333679 is considered to be the major contributor to the efficacy of selexipag. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Effects of selexipag on platelet aggregation, bleeding, and bone metabolism; identification 
of maximal tolerated dose 
The relationship between plasma concentration and pharmacodynamic parameters of platelet 
aggregation and coagulation (ex vivo testing) was investigated in 16 healthy subjects in study AC-065-
101 (placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose study, 12 subjects on selexipag, 4 on placebo). 
Results after multiple-dose administrations of either selexipag or placebo indicated a high level of 
variability and no consistent differences in platelet aggregation test related PD parameters across the 
doses tested were observed. There was no obvious drug- or dose-dependent pattern. Mean % vWF 
measured on each third day after dose escalation was comparable between selexipag and placebo, 
albeit there was a trend for a decrease of vWF with selexipag, the vWF values remained above the 
lower limit of the normal range. Mean concentrations of the coagulation markers sTM and P-selectin 
after treatment with selexipag were not different from placebo. No changes from baseline were 
observed. 
Increased bone ossification was reported in nonclinical studies in the Beagle dog with selexipag 
(studies T08/286 and T08/290). In humans no differences were observed between mean 
concentrations of bone formation PD markers (sOC, P1NP) or bone resorption markers (CTx, NTx; 
study AC-065-101) after treatment with selexipag or placebo. 
The subjects were exposed to dose levels of Selexipag up to 1600 µg bid. The dose level of 1800 µg 
selexipag bid was less well tolerated due to an increase in moderate AEs (headache, myalgia, and 
nausea) that required concomitant medication. The maximum tolerated dose was determined as 1600 
µg bid of selexipag. This dose was selected for further phase 3 testing. 
Effects of selexipag on cardiac repolarisation: study AC-065-106 (thorough QT study) 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report 
Page 38/117 
 
 
The aim of this study was to demonstrate that selexipag and its metabolite do not have an effect on 
cardiac repolarisation measured by the QT interval at steady-state at 2 oral dose levels (800 and 
1600µg bid) in 159 healthy male and female subjects. This was a double-blind, placebo controlled, 
parallel group with nested cross-over, multiple-dose, up-titration study with a positive control (single 
dose of moxifloxacin). Baseline characteristics were generally comparable between the selexipag group 
(treatment A) and the moxifloxacin group (treatment B). 
Selexipag administration was associated with a mild increase in heart rate, with the largest placebo-
corrected change from baseline heart rate reaching 6–7 bpm at 1.5 to 3 h after dosing with 800 μg 
selexipag and 9–10 bpm at the same time points after 1600 μg selexipag. There was no effect on 
mean blood pressure. Selexipag did not show an effect on cardiac repolarisation. Change from baseline 
QT interval corrected using the individualised formula QTcI (ΔQTcI) was small at all timepoints and the 
placebo-corrected ΔQTcI (ΔΔQTcI) did not exceed 1.4 ms (UB of 90% CI 3.9 ms) on selexipag 800µg 
and -0.7 ms (UB of 90% CI 2.1 ms) on 1600µg selexipag. There were no subjects with QTcI exceeding 
480ms or ΔQTcI>30 ms on selexipag. Mean ΔΔQTcI peak effect for 400 mg moxifloxacin was 7.5 ms 
with a LB of the 90%CI of 4.8 msec. The LB of the 90% CI did not exceed 5.0 ms (the threshold 
indicated by the ICH E14 guidance) at any of the post-dose timepoints. 
In this study no adverse experiences of Torsades de Pointes, sudden death, ventricular tachycardia, 
ventricular fibrillation or flutter, or seizures were reported.  
Phototoxic potential of selexipag 
In-vitro data suggested that selexipag and its active metabolite were potentially phototoxic. The 
photosensitizing potential of selexipag (800 and 1200 μg bid) was investigated in 52 healthy subjects, 
compared to placebo and ciprofloxacin (positive control; study AC-065-102). The photosensitizing 
potential of selexipag was assessed by evaluating the subjectʼs cutaneous responses to UV irradiation 
(UV-A at 320–400 nm and UV-B at 290-320 nm) prior to and during the treatment period. Subjects 
were considered photosensitive if the Phototoxic Index (PI), defined as the ratio of baseline minimal 
erythema dose (MED) to post-dose MED (24 h after UV-irradiation) was greater than 1.66 for any 
waveband. The mean PI was below 1.66 for UV-A in all treatment groups, while it was greater than 
1.66 for UV-B in each treatment group. No statistically significant differences in UV-A or UV-B PI 
between either selexipag dose and placebo or ciprofloxacin were observed. Overall, for UV-A and UV-B, 
administration of 800 μg and 1200 μg bid selexipag was not associated with clinically relevant 
phototoxic potential when compared to placebo or ciprofloxacin. 
Substance P 
As both selexipag and its metabolite are IP receptor agonists, substance P levels could increase in 
selexipag treated subjects and could increase pain perception. No effect of selexipag was observed on 
plasma substance P concentrations (study AC-065-102). 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
The PK/ PD relationship between selexipag/ metabolite plasma levels and selected clinical safety and 
efficacy endpoints was evaluated using a population approach using data from the GRIPHON study AC-
065A302. The main finding was a small but statistically significant increase in the 6MWT with 
increasing exposure, from 369 m with no exposure to 392 m with high exposure. 
One phase 2 study (NS-304/02) investigated the relationship between hemodynamic parameters and 
the dose after individual up-titration. The primary endpoint was pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). 
The study included 43 patients with PAH which were randomized in a 3:1 fashion to selexipag or 
placebo. The hemodynamic efficacy of selexipag, individually up-titrated to a maximum dose of 800 μg 
bid, versus placebo was evaluated at week 17. At this time, PVR (geometric mean and 95% CI) was 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report 
Page 39/117 
 
 
80.7% (72.8, 89.6; n = 29) and 115.9% (106.5, 126.1; n = 6) of the baseline values in the selexipag 
and placebo groups, respectively. The percent decrease (vs placebo) in geometric mean PVR of 30.3% 
on selexipag treatment was statistically significant (95% CI: -44.7, -12.2; p = 0.0045, Wilcoxon rank-
sum test). There was no clear relationship between change in PVR and the patient`s optimized dose in 
this study. The PK data indicated that the mean exposure to selexipag and its metabolite at week 17 
were in a similar range across all dose groups. 
In-vivo interaction studies 
In-vivo interaction studies were performed with warfarin and with lopinavir/ritonavir. 
Selexipag given as multiple doses of 400 μg bid had no effect on the exposure to R-warfarin (CYP3A4 
substrate) or S-warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate) after administration of a single dose of 20 mg warfarin 
(study NS304/-01). The pharmacodynamic effect of warfarin on the International Normalized Ratio was 
not affected by selexipag. The PK of selexipag and its active metabolite were not affected by warfarin.  
Genetic differences in PD response 
No DNA samples were collected during clinical development of selexipag. 
2.4.4 Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Methods 
Analytical methods used for determination of selexipag and ACT-333679 concentrations in human 
plasma samples are considered suitable and properly validated. 
Absorption 
An absolute bioavailability study has been conducted (AC-065-110) and indicated an absolute 
bioavailability for selexipag of 0.49 (0.43, 0.57). However, the results for the metabolite ACT-333679 
suggest selexipag to be subject to a first pass effect leading to underestimation of the bioavailability. 
The AUC-value for ACT-333679 after a single oral dose of 400 μg selexipag was approximately 2.55 
times higher compared with 200 μg selexipag i.v. indicating an almost complete absorption of 
selexipag. 
Relative bioavailability after oral administration has been properly characterized. PK results with 
solution (study PS003) and tablet (study QGUY/2006/NS-304/01) were found to be comparable. 
The Applicant has not investigated the absorption site of selexipag. However, based on surface-to-
volume characteristics and pH (around 8), most of the absorption of selexipag (freely soluble at pH 8) 
is anticipated to occur in the duodenum. In study AC-065A302/GRIPHON, 142 (28%) out of the 510 
patients included in the population PK (PopPK) analysis received at least one gastric pH-modifying 
drug. The results suggest no relevant difference with respect to exposure or absorption between 
patients receiving compared to those not receiving gastric pH-modifying drugs. 
Selexipag and ACT-333679 showed a dose-proportional increase in AUC and C max after multiple-dose 
administration in healthy subjects. Steady state conditions were achieved within 3 days.  
Bioequivalence between 1 tablet of 1600 μg and 8 tablets of 200 μg selexipag has been demonstrated. 
A biowaiver for the intermediate dose strengths (400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200, and 1400 μg film-coated 
tablets) is considered justified because the manufacturing process is the same, the qualitative and 
quantitative composition is the same (except for the filler D-mannitol which compensates for 
differences in active substance) and the comparison of dissolution profiles gave f2 values above 50 for 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report 
Page 40/117 
 
 
all dose strengths and dissolution pH tested. Overall, bioequivalence between equimolar doses of 
different dose strengths can be assumed. 
The influence of food on the pharmacokinetics of selexipag is characterised properly. Due to improved 
tolerability and to avoid changes in exposure when switching from fasting to fed intake or vice versa, it 
is recommended to take selexipag in the fed state only. 
Distribution 
Except for protein binding and whole blood / plasma distribution, only few data are available on 
distribution. The volume of distribution of selexipag at steady state is 11.7 L. Taken together, the data 
indicate that drug distribution is most prominent in the extracellular fluid and that selexipag does not 
accumulate in tissues outside the plasma and interstitial fluid. 
Metabolism / Elimination 
Selexipag undergoes enzymatic hydrolysis by CES1 in the liver to yield the active metabolite ACT-
333679. The UGT enzymes UGT1A3 and UGT2B7 contribute 42% to the metabolism of ACT-333679, 
while CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 contribute to 46% and 12%, respectively. 
Special populations 
Gender, race and age are of minor importance for selexipag and ACT-333679 pharmacokinetics.  
Body weight was identified as significant covariate for selexipag and ACT-333679 exposure. However, 
effect on ACT-333679, the major contributor to the efficacy of selexipag, is limited and since selexipag 
dosage will be based on individual tolerability, PK-dependency of weight is not considered an issue. 
Pharmacokinetics in patients with renal or hepatic impairment is characterised properly. The applicant 
suggests warnings in the SmPC that, in patients with moderate hepatic impairment the starting dose of 
200 micrograms once daily (instead of twice daily) and increase at weekly intervals by increments of 
200 micrograms given once daily (instead of twice daily) is recommended. In patients with severe 
hepatic impairment, selexipag should not be used. 
In patients undergoing dialysis, Uptravi should not be used. For patients with severe renal impairment, 
caution should be excerciced during dose titration.  
No adjustment in dose regimen is needed in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment and in 
patients with mild hepatic impairment.  
 The respective wording in the proposed SmPC is in agreement with the results of the studies and is 
acceptable. 
Interactions 
Effects of selexipag and ACT-333679 on enzymes and transporters in the plasma and accordingly 
possible PK interaction with other drugs are considered negligible. However, assuming a luminal 
selexipag concentration of 1.3 µM and a free selexipag concentration in enterocytes of 8 nM, clinically 
relevant induction of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 in the gut cannot be excluded. To address this point the 
applicant will conduct a clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) study with midazolam as a post-approval 
commitment. 
No effect of warfarin on the PK of selexipag or ACT-333679 was observed. The effect of 
lopinavir/ritonavir is considered clinically not relevant because, although plasma concentrations of 
selexipag increased almost 2-fold in the presence of lopinavir/ritonavir, the increase in exposure (1.1-
fold) and Cmax (1.3-fold) of the active metabolite (which is the major contributor to efficacy) was small. 
The lopinavir/ritonavir interaction study suggests minor importance of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, CYP3A4 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report 
Page 41/117 
 
 
and P-gp, however simultaneous inhibition of several compounds limit the interpretation to some 
extent as effects may counterbalance each other. 
No data were provided in respect to a possible influence of transporter / enzyme inhibition or induction 
on the PK of selexipag or ACT-333679. This appears most important in respect to CYP2C8. A warning 
in respect to the combination of selexipag with CYP2C8, UGT1A3, and UGT2B7 modulators with an 
explicit listing of the drugs known to modulate these enzymes is included in the SmPC. The applicant is 
planning to undertake, as a post-approval commitment, a clinical DDI study with gemfibrozil, a strong 
inhibitor of CYP2C8. The extent of increased drug elimination by induction of CYP2C8 cannot be 
predicted and might result in a relevant loss of efficacy. To address this point, the applicant is planning 
to conduct a clinical DDI study with rifampicin as a post-approval commitment in addition to the DDI 
study with gemfibrozil. If it cannot be concluded that CYP2C8 is the major enzyme involved in the 
elimination of selexipag further studies may be needed to characterize the elimination in vivo. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The effect of selexipag and its metabolite on platelet aggregation, coagulation parameters, bone 
metabolism, cardiac repolarisation, and interaction with concomitantly administered drugs was 
investigated in healthy volunteers. In addition, the potential of selexipag to cause phototoxic reactions 
was investigated. 
Prostacyclin is a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation. Selexipag inhibited platelet aggregation 
induced by ADP in platelet-rich plasma from humans and monkeys with IC50 values of 5.5 and 3.4 μM, 
respectively (for details please refer to Nonclinical section). In study AC-065-101 pharmacodynamic 
Platelet Aggregation Test parameters (Emax, Etrough, AUE0-12, and tmax) after multiple-dose 
administration of either ACT-293987 or placebo twice daily (b.i.d) indicated a high level of variability 
presumably due to the limited number of subjects. There was no obvious drug- or dose-dependent 
pattern. In vitro data indicated that the mean maximal and trough plasma ACT-333679 concentrations 
in humans at 1600 μg b.i.d. are 3- and 16-fold lower than the IC50 of ADP-induced platelet 
aggregation, respectively; at these concentrations, platelet aggregation is inhibited by 1-15%. Overall, 
at therapeutic plasma levels an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation is considered unlikely. 
Because prostaglandin I2 receptors play a role in bone remodelling and because increased ossification 
was reported in a toxicity study in dogs, the effect of selexipag on bone formation markers and bone 
resorption markers was investigated. No differences to placebo were observed for any marker. 
However, in view of the low subject number and high variability a firm conclusion of a neutral effect of 
selexipag on bone metabolism cannot be drawn. 
Selexipag did not affect cardiac repolarisation based on the thorough QT study (AC-065-106) 
conducted in accordance with Guideline ICH E14.  
Selexipag was not associated with a clinically relevant phototoxic potential (study AC-065-102).  
Selexipag seems not to increase Substance P which is involved in pain perception. 
In-vivo interaction studies in healthy subjects were performed with warfarin and lopinavir/ritonavir. 
Selexipag (400 µg twice a day) did not alter the exposure to S-warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate) or R-
warfarin (CYP3A4 substrate). Selexipag did not influence the pharmacodynamic effect of warfarin on 
the international normalized ratio. The pharmacokinetics of selexipag and its active metabolite are not 
affected by warfarin. Thus, selexipag can be used in combination with warfarin without dose 
adjustment. Based on similar metabolism, this conclusion is considered valid also for other vitamin K 
antagonists, such as phenprocoumon and acenocoumarol. 
Potential drug-drug interactions between PAH co-medication (ERA and/or PDE inhibitor) and selexipag 
and its active metabolite were investigated in the phase 3 program by PopPK/PD analyses. PAH co-
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report 
Page 42/117 
 
 
medications (ERAs, PDE-5 inhibitors, and both) did not affect the PK of selexipag but statistically 
significantly increased the elimination rate constant of ACT-333679. The concomitant use of both an 
ERA and a PDE-5 inhibitor was predicted to result in a 30% lower exposure to ACT-333679 (please 
refer to section on PopPK/PD).  
The SmPC reflects the findings of the PopPK analysis. However, the clinical relevance of the lower 
exposure determined in the PopPK analysis may be limited in light of the high intra-individual (87% for 
selexipag, 70% for the metabolite) and inter-individual variability (30%) found in the PopPK analysis. 
The relationship between plasma concentration and effect was explored within the clinical development 
program (study NS-304/02) and by population PK/PD modelling using data from the phase 3 study. 
The population PK/PD analysis found a small increase (by 23m) in efficacy (6MWT) with increasing 
dose. A proof-of-concept study NS-304/02 supported the efficacy of selexipag in patients with PAH 
over the proposed dose range of 200 µg to 800 µg bid. PVR was significantly reduced by about 30% 
compared to placebo. A dose-proportional effect on PVR could not be found in this study, which is likely 
due to the low patient numbers studied and high variability. 
Based on the data available, no conclusion on a positive relationship between dose and effect can be 
drawn. This is considered of limited clinical importance since an individual up-titration regimen based 
on individual tolerability is proposed for selexipag. Gradual up-titration to the individual patient`s 
tolerated dose is the general accepted regimen for prostaglandin receptor agonists. Based on 
tolerability in healthy male subjects (study ACT-065-101), 1600µg bid was selected as the maximal 
tolerated dose for further phase 3 testing. 
2.4.5 Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
In general, the evaluation of pharmacokinetics is considered appropriate.  
Limited data were provided in respect to a possible influence of transporter / enzyme inhibition or 
induction on the PK of selexipag or ACT-333679. This appears most important in respect to CYP2C8. In 
addition a clinically relevant induction of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 in the gut by selexipag cannot be 
excluded. The applicant has committed to conduct post-marketing studies to address these issues, 
which is considered acceptable. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Based on the clinical pharmacology data selexipag does not affect cardiac repolarisation. Selexipag has 
no phototoxic potential. 
No relevant in-vivo drug-drug interactions were found. No clear dose-response relationship was 
demonstrated. However, this is considered without clinical relevance since an individual dose up-
titration according to tolerability is proposed. The dose range selected for the phase 3 study is 
considered justified based on the pharmacology data.

Summary of main efficacy results 
The clinical phase 2 and 3 studies relevant for dose finding, efficacy and safety are summarised in 
table 1. 
The application also contains information from Phase 2 studies conducted in other indications, i.e., a 
controlled study and its open-label extension in patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary 
hypertension (CTEPH) and an ongoing controlled study in patients with arteriosclerosis obliterans 
(Table 2). 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report

Dose-response studies 
Doses in the range of 200 – 1600 µg b.i.d. were administered in the pivotal study (GRIPHON study)As 
with other IP receptor agonists, dosing of selexipag aimed at achieving the maximum individually 
tolerated dose for maintenance treatment. In the pivotal GRIPHON study, this was achieved through a 
12-week up-titration program, allowing a highest dose of 1600 μg b.i.d. (the dose defined as the 
maximum well-tolerated dose in healthy subjects). 
The selection of the dose regimen and titration scheme used in the phase 3 study was based mainly on 
data from the PK/PD study NS-304/02. Phase I studies indicated that single doses of selexipag 100, 
200, and 400 μg given after overnight fasting were well tolerated. Single doses of selexipag 600 and 
800 μg led to adverse events like headache, nausea, dizziness, and vomiting. Multiple doses of 
selexipag 200, 400, and 400/600 μg twice daily (b.i.d.) were better tolerated. Improved tolerability 
after repeated dosing was suggested by the poor tolerability of a single 600-µg dose, whereas 600 μg 
b.i.d. was better tolerated when it followed administration of 400 µg b.i.d. during multiple dosing.  
A b.i.d. application was selected in order to attain an acceptable exposure (AUC) of both the parent 
compound and the active metabolite ACT-333679 over the course of 24 h. In selexipag Phase 1 studies 
AC-065-101, AC-065-106 and AC-065-108 in which “forced” up-titrations were performed (as opposed 
to titration-by-tolerability), a trend for an increase in treatment emergent AEs typical for prostacyclin 
therapy was observed with increasing dose. This was also accompanied by a premature discontinuation 
rate (ranging between 19–38%) that was higher than that observed in Phase 2/3 studies. The use of 
weekly intervals between titration steps in study AC-065A302 was based on practical considerations. 
The starting dose of 200 μg b.i.d. in the pivotal study AC-065A302 was based on safety and tolerability 
data from study QGUY/2006/NS304/-01, a comparable tolerability profile of multiple doses of both 200 
μg and 400 μg b.i.d. was demonstrated on initiation with the lower dose to account for potential inter-
individual differences. Titration steps of 200 μg b.i.d. were introduced based on the understanding that 
the first up-titration step to 400 μg b.i.d. would result in a dose that had shown acceptable tolerability 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report

as a starting dose in study QGUY/2006/NS304/-01. The highest allowed dose in AC-065A302 of 1600 
μg b.i.d. was based on the observation from the Phase 1 study AC-065-101, in which the incidence of 
AEs of moderate severity requiring administration of concomitant medication was greater on the 
highest tested dose of 1800 μg b.i.d. compared to the 1600 μg b.i.d. and lower doses. No severe AEs 
were reported on any highest dose. The concept of gradual dose uptitration according to individual 
patient tolerability was further supported by data from studies in Japanese patients with PAH Dana 
class 1 (AC-065A201, individual dose titration from 200 to 1600 μg b.i.d.) and in patients with CTEPH 
(AC-065B202, individual dose titration from 100 to 800 μg b.i.d.) Albeit no clear dose relation for PVR 
was seen in study AC-065A201, efficacy on PVR appeared to be higher at the highest maintenance 
doses (1400 and 1600 µg bid). 
The approach of an individual dose titration guided by tolerability is based on an assumption of a 
relationship between maximally tolerated and efficacious doses in the individual patient. As discussed 
below, the assumption seemed to be supported by the result for the primary efficacy endpoint in the 
pivotal GRIPHON trial. There was no correlation between maintenance dose and primary efficacy 
outcome.  
Study NS-304/-02 was important for the selection of the doses used in phase 3. It was a 
multicenter, multinational, prospective, Phase 2a study of ACT-293987 treatment in PAH patients 
conducted in two periods: an open-label, single-dose acute period evaluating the effect of the drug on 
the hemodynamic parameters, followed by a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-
controlled 21-week treatment period investigating change in PVR, 6 MWT, Borg dysponea scale and 
other parameters. In the double blind treatment patients were uptitrated from 200 µg b.i.d. to a 
maximally tolerated individual dose but not above 800 µg b.i.d. 43 patients were enrolled and 
randomized 3:1 selexipag vs. placebo. The interpretation of the data is hampered by the low number 
of patients included and by the exclusion of 8 patients from the per-protocol set, leaving only 6 
patients in the placebo group. There was an effect on PVR, on 6- MWT, a small effect on other 
haemodynamic parameters and on plasma NT pro-BNP concentrations. However, no conclusions can be 
drawn, whether there was a dose relation or not. No treatment effects were seen on NYHA functional 
class and Borg dyspnea score, and echocardiographic parameters. For 6-MWT there was even a 
negative result in patients receiving the lowest maintenance dose of 200 µg b.i.d. (n=4). This result 
was consistent with the result in the pivotal GRIPHON study. In GRIPHON, patients on a maximally 
tolerated dose <500 µg bid also had a negative effect on the 26 week 6 MWT as compared to placebo 
(see below).  
The applicant has discussed the limitations of the assessment of the 6 MWD in relation to attained 
individual maintenance dose. In GRIPHON (see below), patients with down-titration due to prostacyclin 
related AEs had a sufficient efficacy for the primary endpoint. This supports the assumption that 
individual tolerability is linked to individual efficacy. For the other patients in the low dose range 
sufficient efficacy could not been demonstrated. Therefore, for the low dose group without dose 
limiting prostacyclin related AEs, it should be considered to try to up-titrate again at a later time point. 
Taken together, a bid dosing and the approach of an individual uptitration of the dose based on 
tolerability is considered appropriate. Also, a dose range to be investigated in the pivotal GRIPHON trial 
(200 – 1600 µg bid) is justified based on studies 304/02 (tolerability, hemodynamic endpoints and 
efficacy endpoints for 200 and 400 µg single dose and 200 – 800 µg bid) and AC-065-101 (acceptable 
tolerability of 200 – 1600 µg bid with a lower tolerability of 1800 µg bid). 
2.5.2 Main study 
The application is mainly based on one pivotal trial, the AC-065A302 "GRIPHON" study. Overall the 
following studies contributed to the efficacy assessment as shown in Table 1-4:

Pivotal trial 
Study title: AC-065A302/GRIPHON: Prostacyclin (PGI2) receptor agonist in pulmonary 
arterial hypertension. A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study 
assessing the efficacy and safety of selexipag (ACT-293987) on morbidity and mortality in 
patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) 
The study comprised the following periods: - Treatment period: Patients were uptitrated from 200 µg 
b.i.d. to a maximally tolerated individual dose but not above 1600 µg b.i.d. (12 weeks) and patients 
were kept on the maximally tolerated dose over 14 additional weeks. - Post-treatment observation 
period. - Post-treatment safety follow-up, and - double blind treatment Extension period.  
Patients who had an end of study (EOS) visit following a morbidity event confirmed by the CEC were 
eligible to enter the extension study AC-065A303, in which all patients received open-label selexipag.  
GRIPHON - study AC-065A302 
Methods 
The study was conducted at 181 sites in 39 countries (Asia, Australia, Europe, Latin America, and 
North America), with 171 sites in 34 countries participating also in the extension study AC-
065A303/GRIPHON OL. 
The following committees were involved in the conduct of the study: Steering Committee / Scientific 
Advisory Board (study design and conduct of the study), Critical Event Committee (CEC, blinded to 
treatment allocation and to prostacyclin- associated adverse events (AEs): adjudication of all reported 
morbidity/mortality (MM) events, initially, event-adjudication was only performed to confirm the 
occurrence of an MM event. Following Global Protocol Amendment 6, the process was  adjusted to 
adjudicate the following details:  i) the presence of an MM even tii) the type of endpoint component, 
iii) the MM event onset date, and iv) any PAH-association with a fatal outcome), Expert medical PAH 
review committee (blinded review of baseline PAH-related characteristics), and the Ophthalmology 
Safety Board (blinded to treatment allocation, reviewed ophthalmology data available from patients 
enrolled in the ophthalmology sub-study), Data Monitoring Committee (DMC, unblinded efficacy, safety 
and tolerability data approximately every 3 months to ensure patient safety in AC-065A302 and AC-
065A303). The DMC conducted a planned unblinded interim efficacy and safety analysis on 29 April 
2013 after 206 CEC-confirmed MM events were reported and recommended the continuation of the 
study.  
AC-065A302/GRIPHON study design: 
This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled, event-driven 
Phase 3 study to compare the effects (efficacy, safety, tolerability, 
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics [PK/PD]) of selexipag (administered orally at an individualized 
dose in the range of 200– 1600 μg b.i.d.) versus placebo (1:1 randomization) in patients with 
symptomatic PAH. In case of typical prostacyclin-associated AEs the dose was reduced by 200 µ bid 
(MTD). 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report 
Page 47/117 
 
 
 
The study comprised the following periods [Figure 9-1]: 
- Screening period 
- Treatment period: first dose on the evening of day 1 (200 µg or placebo), uptitration in weekly 
increments in 200 µg bid steps until maximally tolerated individual maintenance dose (MTD) up to 
week 12.  At Week 12, the MTD for each patient was determined, and this dose was to be kept stable 
for the next 14 weeks. After Week 26, for patients with study drug dose < 1600 μg b.i.d., 
investigators were allowed to further up-titrate the dose, if needed, by 200 μg increments up to the 
maximum of 1600 μg b.i.d., only at scheduled visits. Dose reduction for tolerability was allowed. 
- Post-treatment observation period (PTOP4 - refer to Figure 9-1) (added in study design following 
Protocol Amendment 6): patients who discontinued study drug with or without an MM event prior to 
Study closure announcement had an option to enter a post-treatment observation period to collect 
additional clinical data. A post-treatment observation closure visit (PTOCV) was to be performed within 
4 weeks of Study closure announcement. 
- Post-treatment safety follow-up for serious adverse event (SAEs) up to 30 days after the last intake 
of study drug or until administration of the first dose of selexipag in extension study AC-065A303, 
whichever occurred first. 
- Survival follow-up phone call4 (refer to Figure 9-1): All patients (except those who had withdrawn 
consent from all study components) were contacted at the time of study closure to ascertain vital 
status. Survival data up to study closure (overall study) includes patients from different phases of the 
study. 
- Treatment Extension period3 (refer to Figure 9-1): for patients who were receiving AC-065A302 study 
drug at the time of Study closure, a double blind treatment extension period was offered that was 
planned to be up to 3 months. Patients who had an EOS visit following a morbidity event confirmed by 
the CEC were eligible to enter the extension study AC-065A303, if the extension study was approved 
by the national Health Authority in the country. 
End of study (EOS) was reached a) after an MM event or at the time of premature discontinuation of 
study medication (for an individual patient), b) at the time when 331 MM events were achieved (for 
the remainining patients). EOS analysis does not include the extension study AC-065A303.

1. EOS Visit was to be performed within 4 weeks of Study closure announcement. For patients who had 
a CEC-confirmed MM event or discontinued study drug before Study closure, the EOS Visit was 
performed following the morbidity event or following premature discontinuation. A Post-treatment 
safety follow-up phone call was performed for all patients who discontinued treatment. 
2. Study closure was announced when the target number of CEC-confirmed MM events was achieved.  
AC-065A303/GRIPHON OL study design: 
It was an open-label, uncontrolled study following the double-blind study AC-065A302 to assess long-
term safety and tolerability of selexipag in patients with PAH. Patients from study AC-065A302 who 
had a CEC-confirmed morbidity event or who completed study AC-065A302 as scheduled, and who met 
the eligibility criteria were eligible to be enrolled in AC-065A303. All patients receive selexipag during 
AC-065A303. The study is still ongoing.

Sample size 
It was initially estimated that a total of 202 MM events confirmed by the CEC were needed to obtain an 
overall power of 90% for rejection of the null hypothesis (at two sided alpha 0.01), assuming a hazard 
ratio of 0.5729 for selexipag versus placebo over the estimated maximum study duration of 3.5 years. 
The originally assumed hazard ratio of 0.5729 was largely based on previous monotherapy studies in 
patients in WHO FC III/IV and was later amended to 0.65, taking into account the predominant 
enrolment of patients in GRIPHON in FC II and III, and on background PAH therapy. To detect this 
amended treatment effect without changing the protocol requirements for the Type I and Type II error 
rates, and within the study timelines, an increase of the number of primary events to 332 and of the 
sample size to 1150 patients was required. At the same time a group-sequential design with one 
interim analysis to be conducted by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee after the originally 
projected 202 confirmed MM events (an information fraction of f = 202/331 = 0.61) was introduced. 
Based on Protocol Amendment 6 there were further changes to calculation of the sample size and 
assumptions: A total of 331 confirmed MM events were needed in order to obtain an overall power of 
90% for rejection of the null hypothesis. With the recruitment of up to 1150 patients randomized 1:1 
to active treatment and placebo over a period of 3.1 years, the number of events was expected within 
a maximum of 4.3 years. 
Randomisation 
In study AC-065A302 eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to selexipag or placebo using a 
centralized randomization system via IVRS.  
Blinding (masking) Study AC-065A302 was performed in a double-blind fashion.

The null hypothesis was that there was no difference between selexipag and placebo for time to first 
confirmed MM event. The primary statistical analysis was performed on the Full Analysis Set (FAS) by a 
one-sided unstratified log-rank test in a group-sequential setting. A number of supportive analyses to 
the primary endpoint were performed using different tests and models. 
A group-sequential design with one interim analysis to be conducted by the Independent Data 
Monitoring Committee after the originally projected 202 confirmed MM events (an information fraction 
of 202/331 = 0.61) was introduced by amendment. The group-sequential design used a one-sided 
overall type I error level of 0.005, maximum information was specified as 331 first MM events, and the 
one-sided type I error level at the interim analysis was fixed to 0.00005. The change in the target 
hazard ratio was initially discussed with the FDA (Amendment 4 of the protocol). In order to eliminate 
any concern that the protocol changes based on global Amendment 4, submitted on August 16th 2011 
to the FDA, could be considered informed, MM events with a confirmed onset date up to August 16th 
2011 were censored and were not considered in the primary analysis.  
Hierarchical testing was stipulated in the protocol following the list of secondary endpoint as described 
below. This procedure controls the family-wise type I error rate on a one-sided alpha level of 0.005 
(two-sided alpha of 0.01). 
Confirmed MM events, including those with onset date up to August 16th 2011 were included as events 
in the secondary analyses and additional analyses.  
The analyses of the primary endpoint including or excluding components up to study closure used a 
one-sided unstratified log-rank test (at the corresponding one-sided overall type I error level defined 
by the group-sequential design). 
The first secondary endpoints analysed in a hierarchical procedure were (1) the absolute change from 
baseline in 6MWD at trough at Week 26 analyzed by a non-parametric analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA), (2) absence of worsening from baseline to Week 26 in WHO FC was analysed by 2-sided 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by WHO FC at baseline, (3) time from randomization to first of 
confirmed death due to PAH or confirmed hospitalization due to PAH worsening up to 7 days after last 
study drug intake was analyzed by a one-sided unstratified log-rank test and (4) time to death up to 
study closure using a one-sided unstratified log-rank test. 
The analyses of changes in 6MWD and WHO FC over time were performed descriptively.  
GCP 
Generally, there were no indications that the studies were not conducted appropriately. One inspection 
report from DCGI India regarding the Site #6501 Dr. Kohli, Delhi was requested. The applicant stated 
that no report was to be expected from DCGI. The issue is not considered relevant for the overall 
conclusions since only 1 patient was randomised in this center. After additional explanations, an initial 
concern related to partial unblinding for 280 patients in 27 centres to the clinical supply manager and 
unblinding due to typical AEs was not considered to be relevant for the reliability of the data or the 
integrity of the study. 
Results 
AC-065A302 
Baseline characteristics and study discontinuations 
A total of 1156 patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to selexipag (N = 574) or placebo (N = 582). A 
total of 27.0% and 41.6% of patients in the selexipag and placebo groups, respectively, discontinued 
with a CEC-confirmed Morbidity/Mortality (MM) event up to EOT + 7 days. The proportion of patients 
who discontinued prior to Study closure with no CEC-confirmed MM event up to EOT + 7 days was

22.6% in the selexipag group and 15.1% in the placebo group. 113 and 137 patients in the selexipag 
and placebo groups, respectively, consented to participate in the post-treatment observation period 
(PTOP). The disposition of patients is summarized in Table 15-1 and in Figure 10-1. 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report 
Page 53/117 
 
 
 
A total of 218 patients (63 previously randomized to selexipag, 155 previously randomized to placebo) 
were enrolled into the extension study AC-065A303. All 218 patients received selexipag in study AC-
065A303. 
The study population was predominantly female (79.8%). Median age at screening was 49.0 years, 
and approximately 18% of the patients were elderly (≥ 65 years). Most of the patients were 
Caucasian/White (65.0%) or Asian (21.2%). Median time from PAH diagnosis was 1.0 year. The most 
common PAH etiology was idiopathic (56.1%), followed by PAH associated with connective tissue 
disease (28.9%) or congenital heart disease (9.5%). Only few patients with heritable, drug or toxin 
induced, or HIV infection mediated PAH were included (0.9 – 2.3% with 10 – 27 patients of the total 
number of subjects randomized). At baseline, patients were predominantly in NYHA/WHO FC II 
(45.8%) and FC III (52.5%). Only 9 patients in FC I and only 11 in FC IV were randomized. The 
median 6MWD of 372.0 m and the median Borg dyspnea index of 3.0 at baseline correspond to this FC 
distribution. Similar proportions of patients in each treatment group (80.5% selexipag, 78.7% placebo) 
were receiving background PAH-specific therapy at baseline, mainly PDE-5 inhibitor monotherapy 
(32.9% selexipag, 31.8% placebo) or combination therapy with ERA and PDE-5 inhibitor (31.2% 
selexipag, 33.8% placebo). Patients entering study AC-065A303 tended to have more severe disease. 
Maintenance doses of selexipag 
The individual maintenance dose in the selexipag group and in the placebo group are shown in Table 
11-1

28.4% of the patients reached the maximal dose level with selexipag, 67.5% with placebo. The 
placebo data indicate that in some of the patients dose titration by tolerability may not lead to the 
optimal dose because non-specific events are a reason not to increase the dose further. . In clinical 
practice, trying to increase the dose again at a later time point may be appropriate for such 
patients.  
Efficacy results 
The median double-blind on-treatment period was 70.7 weeks in the selexipag and 63.7 weeks in 
the placebo group, respectively. The proportion of patients who experienced a CEC-confirmed MM 
event up to 7 days after last study drug intake was 24.4% (140 patients) in the selexipag group 
compared to 36.4% (212 patients) in the placebo group (Figure 11-1). The primary efficacy 
endpoint showed a clear and significant effect favoring selexipag. There was a numerical difference 
of 72 events between the groups favoring selexipag.

The observed treatment effect was consistent across subgroups (Figure 11-7). Only for the Asian race 
and the subgroups of Asia and North America (geographical region), the hazard ratio for selexipag 
versus placebo was close to 1.  
For the overall primary analysis shown above according to amendment 5 (the assumed hazard ratio 
was increased from 0.5729 to 0.650 and consecutively the planned sample size was increased from 
670 to 1150 patients) events up to 16 Aug 2011 were not counted in order to eliminate any concern 
that the protocol change could be considered informed. Overall, the results were consistent for the 
analyses including these events. When events up to August 16 2011 were included the proportion of 
patients who experienced a CEC-confirmed MM event up to 7 days after last study drug intake was 
27.0% (155 patients) in the selexipag group compared to 41.6% (242 patients) in the placebo group. .

A competing risk analysis showed that all 4 components of the primary efficacy endpoint components 
competed with each other during the treatment period since the occurrence of one prevented the 
observation of the others up to 7 days after last study drug intake. Patients in the selexipag group 
showed a lower risk of disease progression (p < 0.0001) and hospitalization for PAH worsening (p = 
0.0402) than patients in the placebo group. No significant difference was observed between selexipag 
and placebo for the risk of PAH worsening (p = 0.5342).

The number of patients who experienced, as a first event, death due to PAH or hospitalisation for PAH 
up to end of treatment was 102 (17.8%) in the selexipag group and 137 (23.5%) in the placebo 
group. Death due to PAH as a component of the endpoint was observed in 16 (2.8%) patients on 
selexipag and 14 (2.4%) on placebo. Hospitalisation for PAH was observed in 86 (15.0%) patients on 
selexipag and 123 (21.1%) patients on placebo. Selexipag reduced the risk of hospitalisation for PAH 
as a first outcome event compared to placebo (HR 0.67, 99% CI: 0.46, 0.98; one sided log rank p = 
0.04). 
Effect of selexipag on mortality 
Death as a first event was in favour of placebo (4.9 vs. 3.1%, 28 vs. 18 events) (censored analysis: 
4.4 vs. 2.7%, 25 vs. 16 events) almost reaching statistical significance (p = 0.0827). The unfavourable 
trend emerged after about 18 months of treatment. Median treatment duration was different in the 
selexipag (70.7 weeks) vs. the placebo (63.7 weeks) group. Adjustment for this difference reduced but 
did not remove the numerical difference in mortality at EOT: taking into account the treatment 
duration, mortality rate (deaths per 100 patient years) was 5.45 in the selexipag and 4.64 in the 
placebo group, yielding a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.17. 
The GRIPHON trial was event-driven and designed to stop treatment of an individual patient after their 
first primary outcome event, which was usually a disease progression (morbidity) event. Experiencing 
a morbidity event was associated with a higher risk of dying. 
Up to EOT, more morbidity events occurred in patients on placebo than in patients on selexipag (205 
vs. 109 respectively). Consistently, in the post-treatment observation period (PTOP), more patients 
entering from the placebo group (17/137, 12.4%) died than patients entering from the selexipag group 
(11/113, 9.7%). Not all patients entered the subsequent extension study (in which all patients 
received open-label selexipag). Death rate was generally higher in patients not participating vs. those 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report 
Page 60/117 
 
 
 
participating in the extension study: for patients having already received selexipag in the parent study, 
the difference in death rate was 0.41 vs. 0.33 per patient year, respectively; (patients after a CEC 
confirmed M&M event). For patients coming from the placebo group, the difference in death rate was 
0.37 vs. 0.22 per patient year, respectively.  
A number of additional analyses were performed to address aspects of the results for the mortality 
component of the primary endpoint.  
According to the analyses, death rates up to EOT are biased by informative censoring. Informative 
censoring occurs when events are not counted in the analysis due to reasons related to the study 
design. 
Since more morbidity events occurred in the placebo group, more patients at high risk were excluded 
from further follow-up in the placebo group than in the selexipag group with a consequence that 
follow-up is shorter in the placebo group and follow-up from more patients that are at higher risk is 
excluded from the placebo group, resulting in bias. Observation of the patient is ‘censored’ when 
follow-up is discontinued according to the protocol definition and because the risk for those patients is 
probably increased, the censoring is termed ‘informative’ for outcome (patients at increased risk are 
more likely to be censored). In other words, due to the study design, the risk profile of the patients 
changed during the course of the study, favouring placebo group at the end of the trial despite of 
randomization. This is consistent with the observation that the imbalance did not emerge before month 
18. 
In order to further evaluate the overall effect of informative censoring on the treatment comparison for 
survival, an analysis as proposed by Denne et al. 2013 was conducted by the applicant. The method 
compares the event rates in the study arms prior to censoring with the follow-up period after EOT +7 
days up to study closure. If the censoring would be non-informative (i.e. if morbidity and mortality 
events would be independent from one another), the ratio of the event rates (censoring event rate 
ratio, CERR) would be expected to be 1.0. The observed CERR was 4.8 in the placebo group and 4.2 in 
the selexipag group indicating that patients censored are at a considerably greater risk of death 
compared to patients not censored in both treatment arms. 
Additionally, a “landmark analysis” as proposed by Anderson et al 1983 was performed. This analysis 
compares survival between patients with and without a morbidity event prior to the landmark time 
points 3, 6, 12 and 18 months. In both treatment arms, the hazard ratio for death was significantly 
increased for patients with a morbidity event compared to patients without a morbidity event at all 
time points. In the selexipag group, the hazard ratio decreased slightly over time. This analysis 
supports the view that a morbidity event is associated with an increased risk of death. 
Up to study closure a total of 100 and 105 patients in the selexipag and placebo groups died, 
respectively (Fig. 10-1, and Fig. 11-13). In this analysis patients were included that, after the first 
M&M event, either remained on selexipag, discontinued treatment or switched from placebo to 
selexipag in the extension study. This implies that patients on placebo could cross over to treatment 
with selexipag and this cross-over could have an impact the mortality estimates. 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report 
Page 61/117 
 
 
The applicant presented two analyses to explore the impact of cross-over from the placebo arm and 
treatment discontinuations in the selexipag arm on the mortality up to study closure. These are a Rank 
Preserving Structural Accelerated Failure Time Model (RPSFT Model) and an approach using a Marginal 
Structural Cox Proportional Hazards Model with time-dependent weights according to the Inverse 
Probability of Censoring Weighting (IPCW) scheme. For both approaches, the RPSFT and Structural 
Proportional Hazards Model analyses, patients were considered on “active treatment” if they were 
treated with selexipag or with an agent targeting the same pathway as selexipag. The number of 
patients in both treatment arms receiving prostacyclin and analogues with the same target as 
selexipag after study drug discontinuation was similar (40 in the selexipag arm, 44 in the placebo 
arm). Considering selexipag and agents targeting the same pathway as selexipag as “active 
treatment”, patients in the selexipag arm were about 85% of their observation time on active 
treatment and patients in the placebo arm were about 16% on active treatment. 
The results RPSFT Model provide a valuable estimate of relative survival on active treatment compared 
to no treatment of 1.19 with a quite wide 95% confidence interval of (0.56, 2.05). 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report 
Page 62/117 
 
 
 
Using the Structural Proportional Hazards Model with IPCW weighting the estimate for the hazard ratio 
for death as if all patients had received active treatment compared to the situation if all patients had 
never received active treatment was 0.92 with a 95% confidence interval of (0.58, 1.47) for the 1 
month time intervals, showing a slight advantage for treatment with selexipag. Both estimations with 
models with longer time intervals show non-significant lower hazard ratios (0.79 and 0.75).  
A subgroup analysis for mortality indicated that the imbalance favouring placebo was restricted to 
patients in WHO FC I/ÌI (HR 1.70, (99% CI 0.59, 4.91), death up to EOT + 7 days, p=0.28). The 
analysis up to study closure showed a significant treatment by subgroup interaction for NYHA/WHO FC 
at baseline (p=0.0346) with a HR for FC I/II of 1.69 (0.80; 3.56) favouring placebo.  
The Applicant submitted two independent mathematical simulations in order to model the observed 
pattern of mortality. The observed data could be fitted well with two assumptions: First, selexipag has 
a neutral effect on mortality, i.e. mortality is neither increased nor reduced by selexipag intake. 
Second, selexipag reduces non-fatal but not fatal endpoint events during treatment. This assumption 
was needed to explain the higher proportion of mortality among the endpoint events with selexipag as 
compared to placebo. 
The simulations showed that the probability to observe a large imbalance for death as first event of 10 
(or more) is in the range of 30% to 51% and for death up to EOT+7d of 9 (or more) is in the range of 
26% to 47%. The probability to observe any imbalance with more deaths as first event for selexipag 
would be typically higher than 70%. 
Additional discussion is provided in section 2.6.1 Discussion on clinical safety. 
A post-morbidity event survival analysis by treatment path was conducted [Figure 4]. The Kaplan-
Meier survival estimate was better in patients treated with selexipag in the OL extension study (AC-
065A303/GRIPHON OL), than in patients treated with standard of care (SoC) outside GRIPHON OL, 
irrespective of their original treatment allocation. Of note, patients were not randomly allocated in this 
analysis and it cannot be clarified whether deteriorating patients may have preferentially received 
selexipag or standard of care. Since pre-treatment status (selexipag or placebo) did not appear to 
have a major impact on outcome during the open label phase, the data do not suggest selexipag to 
have a beneficial disease modifying effect beyond treatment time. 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report

The Applicant also provided a post-hoc analysis using the primary endpoint as proposed by the CHMP 
guideline on PAH. 
Notably, the composite endpoint recommended in the respective CHMP guideline includes right-sided 
heart failure, which was not part of the primary composite endpoint in GRIPHON. With this analysis, 
death as an overall first event was essentially balanced between the selexipag and placebo groups 
(2.4% vs. 2.1%, see table below). 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report 
Page 64/117 
 
 
 
The incidence of the components of the CHMP-defined endpoint are displayed in the table below (first 
event in each category analysis, a patient may be counted in more than one category). 
When using the CHMP proposed primary composite endpoint, the results in all predefined subgroups 
were consistently in favour of selexipag (HR between 0.26 and 0.89) with the exception of patients on 
previous ERA monotherapy (HR 1.29 (0.74; 2.22 99% CI) and the geographical region North America 
(HR 1.18 (0.79; 1.98)).

6-MWD 
Median absolute change from Baseline to Week 26 in 6MWD measured at trough was 4.0 m in the 
selexipag group and −9.0 m in the placebo group.  The difference was statistically significant (1-sided 
Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney p = 0.0027). The treatment effect (location shift using Hodges-Lehmann 
method) versus placebo in the selexipag group was 12.0 m (99% CI: 1, 24).  Mean change was -52.00 
m and -66.26 m, respectively. There was a significantly lower incidence of patients in the selexipag 
group (198 patients, 34.5%) compared to the placebo group (284 patients, 48.8%) who experienced a 
drop (deterioration) in 6MWD ≥ 15% during the GRIPHON treatment period (see Table 52 below). The 
treatment effect on the 6MWD was larger in treatment naïve patients (difference of +34 m vs. placebo 
at the pre-defined timepoint of 6 months (99% CI: 10.0; 63.0, 1-sided Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney p = 
0.0002)) compared to patients pretreated with ERA, PDEi or ERA+ PDEi (location shift -1 (-38.0; 28.0 
m), +12.0 (-8.0; 33.0m), and +6.0 (-14.0; 24.0 m), respectively). It was larger in patients with FC 
III/(IV) (+17.0 (-1.0; 36m) compared to patients with FC (I)/II (+5.0 (-8.0; 19.0 m). 
Change from baseline in NYHA/WHO FC 
At all time points, the proportion of patients with non-missing values who had improved FC compared 
to Baseline was greater in the selexipag group than in the placebo group. The proportion of patients 
with non-missing values who had worsened FC compared to Baseline was lower in the selexipag group 
than in the placebo group except for week 4, month 6 and month 24. 
Quality of life (Cambridge Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review) 
For the overall symptom score, the treatment effect (median absolute change from Baseline to Week 
26) of selexipag versus placebo was 0.0 (99% CI: −1.0, 1.0, p = 0.2185). For the sub-scale 
‘Breathlessness’ the treatment effect of selexipag versus placebo was 0.0 (99% CI: −0.4, 0.0, p = 
0.1700). 
Plasma NT pro-BNP 
The absolute change from Baseline to end of treatment (corresponding to individual patients end of 
study visit) in median plasma NT pro-BNP was 5.5 ng/L (range: −4790 to 10873) in the selexipag 
group compared to 75.0 ng/L (range: −7309 to 41586) in the placebo group, mean absolute changes 
from baseline were 271.7 (SD 1337.6) vs. 659.6 (SD 2976.3) ng/mL, respectively. 
Efficacy by individual maintenance dose 
For the primary efficacy endpoint there was no clear correlation between dose and treatment effect. 
The hazard ratios versus placebo for the occurrence of an MM event in the selexipag IMD categories 
were: 
• selexipag IMD category 200–500 μg b.i.d.: 0.60 (95% CI: 0.41, 0.88, 1-sided unstratified log-rank p 
= 0.0038), 
• selexipag IMD category 600–1100 μg b.i.d.: 0.53 (95% CI: 0.38, 0.72, 1-sided unstratified log-rank 
p ˂ 0.0001), and 
• selexipag IMD category 1200–1600 μg b.i.d.: 0.64 (95% CI: 0.49, 0.82, 1-sided unstratified log-rank 
p = 0.0002). 
For the 6-MWT 
median/mean absolute changes from Baseline to Week 26 in 6MWD measured at trough in the 
selexipag IMD categories were

• selexipag IMD category 200–500 μg b.i.d.: −20.0 m/ -115.68 m

Notes 
According to analyses the higher rate in mortality events as a primary

Clinical studies in special populations 
No studies in special populations were conducted. The pivotal GRIPHON study included a wide variety 
of patients with PAH. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses AND meta-analysis) 
No pooled analyses or meta-analyses were provided by the applicant for efficacy evaluation. 
Supportive studies  
Study AC-065A201 
An interim report of a multicentre, uncontrolled, phase 2 open label clinical study in Japanese patients 
with PAH was provided. The interim report includes the results up to Week 16 of treatment with 
selexipag. Albeit uncontrolled, treatment of 37 patients with PAH over 16 weeks with selexipag was 
associated with small – moderate beneficial effects on pulmonary haemodynamics, as decreases in 
pulmonary vascular resistance, pulmonary artery pressure, and small increases in cardiac output and 
cardiac index. The mean performance in the 6-MWT test improved, but without a placebo control the 
data cannot be considered as a measure of a true treatment effect. No beneficial effect was seen on 
the Borg dyspnea index.  
Study AC-065B201 
Study AC-065B201 was an exploratory controlled, double blind, multicentre study in 34 Japanese 
patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). 
Selexipag was associated with small – moderate beneficial effects on pulmonary haemodynamics, as 
decreases in pulmonary vascular resistance, pulmonary artery pressure, and small increases in cardiac 
index. 
There was no beneficial effect on the 6 MWT: The mean treatment effect (95% CLs of difference in 
mean) selexipag was lower than with placebo: -9 m (-57 to 39 m). No beneficial effect was seen on 
the Borg dyspnea index.  
Study AC-065B202 was an open label extension study of study AC-065B201.

28 patients were treated open label with selexipag. There were small changes in the 6-MWT, the BORG 
dyspnea scale and WHO function class. The data do not indicate a detrimental effect on efficacy 
parameters with selexipag in the long term treatment of patients with CTEPH. 
2.5.3 Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The clinical program was mainly based on 1 controlled pivotal phase III study, the GRIPHION trial, in 
patients with PAH of different origin. 
Prior to initiation of the GRIPHON trial (AC-065A302, 1156 patients) Study NS-304/02 was conducted, 
containing 2 parts, a multicenter, open-label, single-dose, acute hemodynamic study (43 patients) 
followed by a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study over 21 
weeks in 43 patients with PAH. Dose selection for the phase III study based on these studies was 
considered appropriate. 
The design of the pivotal study (GRIPHON trial) was largely in agreement with the requirements of the 
relevant EMA guideline EMEA/CHMP/EWP/356954/2008. The applicant used a combined endpoint 
(death, hospitalization for worsening of PAH based on predefined criteria, worsening of PAH resulting in 
need for lung transplantation or balloon atrial septostomy, initiation of parenteral prostanoid therapy 
or chronic oxygen therapy due to worsening of PAH, and disease progression). Signs or symptoms of 
right heart failure have not been included in the primary endpoint as opposed to the proposal of the 
guideline. The Applicant provided a post-hoc analysis using the composite endpoint suggested by the  
Guideline in PAH. The results were largely consistent with the results of the predefined primary efficacy 
endpoint. After inclusion of right heart failure as a first event, the difference in primary mortality 
events between selexipag and placebo decreased. 
The choice of the primary endpoint in combination with the decision to discontinue selexipag in 
patients after the first primary endpoint event with the possibility to switch placebo patients to 
selexipag after the first event turned out to be a relevant drawback of the design. A large difference 
between the groups for “disease progression (as a component of the primary endpoint)” was a major 
obstacle to reliably assess all-cause mortality. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was accompanied by relevant secondary endpoints including the single 
components of the primary endpoint and 6- MWT, quality of life, Borg dyspnea scale, and biomarkers. 
Generally, there were no indications that the studies were not conducted appropriately. 
At study closure (i.e., when the overall target number of 331 CEC confirmed MM events was achieved), 
vital status of 24 patients (4.2%) and 27 patients (4.6%) in the selexipag and placebo groups, 
respectively, was reported as not known. However, the impact on the overall study results is limited, 
as has been demonstrated by additional analyses provided. 
Study population 
The number of patients included was overall appropriate (selexipag: 574, placebo: 582). In fact up to 
now, GRIPHON is the largest trial conducted in patients with PAH. The median duration of double-blind 
study treatment was 70.7 weeks in the selexipag group compared to 63.7 weeks in the placebo group, 
with 63.8% and 62.6% of patients in the respective groups receiving study treatment for at least 1 
year. The data are sufficient to support long term maintenance of efficacy. 
The patient populations were well characterized based on accepted clinical and haemodynamic criteria, 
mainly patients in WHO II and III. Overall the patient population included in the clinical trials is 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report 
Page 70/117 
 
 
representative of the population of the intended indication. More than 50% of patients had idiopathic 
PAH, almost 30% connective tissue disease, around 10% congenital heart disease. Other groups of 
patients (heritable, drug or toxin induced, HIV infection) had a low representation (0.9 – 3.0%, 5 – 17 
patients). Similarly, only few patients in NHYA I and IV (3 – 8 per group) were included. Therefore, 
only patient with idiopathic PAH and connective tissue disease in stages II – III were sufficiently 
represented in the study in order to be reflected in the wording of an indication. Efficacy data were 
provided separately for IPAH, HPAH, and HIV associated and drug induced PAH. The representation of 
heritable and idiopathic PAH in GRIPHON was similar to SERAPHIN (Opsumit, macitentan).  
The wording of the indication for Opsumit (macitentan) includes both heritable and idiopathic PAH as 
follows: “Efficacy has been shown in a PAH population including idiopathic and heritable PAH, PAH 
associated with …”. A consistent wording including IPAH and HPAH is acceptable for selexipag. Patients 
in FC I and in FC IV are not included in the final wording of the indication due to the limited data 
available in this patient population.  
The  treatment  groups  were  generally  balanced  regarding  demographics  and  disease  characteristics. 
However, a slightly higher proportion of patients in NYHA/WHO FC III/IV and a somewhat lower mean 
baseline  6MWD  was  noted  in  the  placebo  group,  compared  to  selexipag.  According  to  a  sensitivity 
analysis this was not of relevance for the overall study result. 
Most patients (80.5% selexipag, 78.7% placebo) were receiving PAH-specific medication at baseline 
consisting of ERA monotherapy (16.4/13.1%), PDE5 inhibitor monotherapy (32.9/31.8%) or both 
(31.2/33.8%). The use of placebo as a comparator in the GRIPHON study is considered to be ethically 
acceptable in patients receiving background therapy with approved specific PAH medication. The 
Applicant ensured that patients who were not receiving PAH-specific medications at baseline were not 
unduly exposed to any increased risk due to their participation in GRIPHON.  
Statistical methods 
The statistical methods used were well described in all studies and generally considered appropriate. 
The issue of missing values is handled appropriately by providing sensitivity analyses. Post hoc, 
additional analyses were performed in order to assess if the issue of increased mortality with selexipag 
in the first event analysis and whether this finding could be explained by informative censoring. 
Overall, the methods appear to have been appropriately applied. An additional analysis relating to 
grouping of selexipag with other drugs with the same presumed pathway of action confirmed the initial 
analysis.  
The blinded expert medical review revealed that 6.7% of the patients had baseline characteristics 
atypical for PAH, 76.4% typical and 17.0% consistent baseline characteristics. The applicant to 
provided data supporting consistency of the results for 3 groups. 
Maintenance dose 
With respect to dose some patients may have not been uptitrated appropriately due to non-specific 
AES. In clinical practice, trying to increase the dose again at a later time point in patients initially not 
tolerating the maximal dose may be appropriate. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The results on the primary efficacy endpoint showed a clear and significant effect favoring selexipag. 
The proportion of patients who experienced a CEC-confirmed MM event up to 7 days after last study 
drug intake (EOT+ 7d) was 24.4% in the selexipag group compared to 36.4% in the placebo group. 
There was a numerical difference of 72 events between the groups favoring selexipag. The overall 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report 
Page 71/117 
 
 
effect on the primary endpoint was consistent for hospitalization for PAH, parenteral prostanoid or 
oxygen therapy. It was mainly driven by “disease progression” (decrease in 6 MWD accompanied 
either by a decrease in FC or by the need for additional PAH therapy): Selexipag 71 (12.4%) vs. 
placebo 96 (16.5%). On the other hand there was an imbalance for all-cause mortality favoring 
placebo (Selexipag 25 (4.4%), Placebo 16 (2.7%)). A similar numerical imbalance in deaths was 
observed for other secondary survival endpoints in the FAS and safety analysis sets EOT +7 days and 
EOT+30 days. 
The Applicant conducted a number of additional analyses to address aspects of the results for the 
mortality component of the primary endpoint. In subgroup analyses the difference was attributable to 
an imbalance in patients with NYHA II and not with NYHA III. Similarly, the difference was observable 
in patients with better cardiac function but not in patients with poor cardiac function (reference is 
made to the safety section of this report).  The analysis of time to death until study closure showed no 
difference in mortality between selexipag and placebo for the whole group of patients However, in the 
subgroup of patients with FC I/II, mortality was still increased at study closure (HR 1.69). Additional 
analyses indicated that the analysis at end of treatment +7 days underestimates the risk of death in 
both arms and that the degree of underestimation is higher in the placebo group. The analyses are 
hampered by the fact that some patients from the placebo group switched to selexipag in the 
extension study, whereas other patients from the selexipag group did not enter the open label 
extension period on selexipag. Two models accounting for cross-over (i.e. a Rank Preserving Structural 
Accelerated Failure Time Model and a Marginal Structural Cox Proportional Hazards Model (with IPCW)) 
indicated that treatment with selexipag might in the best case even be associated with an 
improvement in mortality by up to about 25%. Two additional simulations were performed which 
indicated that an imbalance for death as first event up to EOT or EOT+7d is not an unexpected result 
under the assumption that selexipag decreases non-fatal but not fatal events. The results showed that 
the probability to observe a large imbalance for death as first event of 10 (or more) is in the range of 
30% to 51% and for death up to EOT+7d of 9 (or more) is in the range of 26% to 47%. The 
probability to observe any imbalance with more deaths as first event for selexipag would be typically 
higher than 70%. 
Taken together, the mortality data are complex to assess. At the primary analysis timepoint EOT+7d, 
selexipag appeared to have  a negative effect on mortality as the primary endpoint component, 
whereas the analysis up to study closure in the full analysis set (FAS) suggested a neutral effect and 
mathematical models which take into account cross-over even indicated an up to 25% reduction in 
mortality. These models should however be interpreted with caution because in any such model 
assumptions have to be made.  
Exclusion of a detrimental effect on survival is a key aspect for a new drug in this therapeutic field 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/356954/2008). The additional analyses provided supported the assumption that the 
increase in mortality after month 18 can be explained by informative censoring. i.e., since selexipag 
was effective in reducing morbidity events, more patients in the placebo arm were taken off study 
medication after a first morbidity event. Since these are patients at increased risk to die, an imbalance 
developed during the study favouring placebo with respect to the risk of dying.  
Simulations indicated that there was a high probability for an imbalance with more deaths as first 
event for selexipag in case the overall effect on mortality was neutral.  
 In addition, when signs and symptoms of right heart failure are taken into account, as proposed by 
the respective CHMP guideline, the difference for death as a first event is small (14 vs. 12 events 
selexipag vs. placebo). No difference in mortality was observed when patients were analysed according 
to Benza disease severity category, a key predictor of survival in patients with PAH (Benza RL et al. 
Circulation 2010).   
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report 
Page 72/117 
 
 
Mortality as a first overall event up to EOT+7 days was mainly due to an increase in MACE events 
which may also be explained by study design. The same statistical considerations apply for MACE 
events for all-cause mortality. Some patients with sudden death on treatment had underlying 
cardiovascular risk factors. It was pointed out that the intermittent increase in heart rate about 2 – 4 
hours after drug intake might be of concern for patients at increased cardiovascular risk due to 
coronary artery disease (see safety section below). Albeit the changes in heart rate were generally 
modest and similar to those seen with other medicinal products approved for PAH the applicant agreed 
to include contraindications in place for prostacyclin analogues (e.g. severe coronary artery disease, 
status post myocardial infarction, unstable angina).  
The main study result was consistent in all of the subgroups investigated. Only in Asian patients and in 
Asia as a geographical region there was no treatment effect. In North America the treatment effect 
was numerically lower than in the other regions. Irrespectively of the regional differences, the results 
do not raise concerns for an application in the EU. Only few Black patients were included. Albeit 
numerically in favour of selexipag, only limited conclusions can be drawn on B/R in black patients.   
The clinical relevance of the effect on the primary endpoint can further be assessed based on the 
results  of  the secondary endpoints. 6 MWT: There was a mean decrease from baseline to week 26 by 
53 m in the selexipag group and by 66 m in the placebo group. Median change was + 4.0 vs. – 9.0 m, 
respectively, indicating that many patients were largely in a stable condition over 26 weeks. The 
treatment effect on the 6MWD in treatment naïve patients (difference of +34 m vs. placebo at the pre-
defined timepoint of 6 months (99% CI: 10.0; 63.0, p = 0.0002)) was within the range of what has 
been observed with other medicinal products previously approved in the EU. As expected, the effect 
was smaller in patients pretreated with ERA, PDEi or ERA+ PDEi (location shift -1 (-38.0; 28.0 m), 
+12.0 (-8.0; 33.0m), and +6.0 (-14.0; 24.0 m), respectively). In patients with FC III/(IV) the 
difference was larger (+17.0 (-1.0; 36m) than in patients with FC (I)/II (+5.0 (-8.0; 19.0 m)). 
Taking into consideration the clinically relevant effect in treatment naive patients that was in the range 
of other medicinal products approved for PAH and the well known observation that the effect on the 6 
MWD is less pronounced in pretreated patients, the moderate mean overall effect on 6-MWD observed 
in the study is mainly related to the high number of pretreated patients included in the study . 
Due to low numbers one should be cautious not to over interpret the negative results in the elderly (≥ 
65 years), in North America, and in Black patients.  
For the reasons of internal consistency, it should be demonstrated that an improvement in 6MWD is 
correlated with not developing the main study outcome "morbidity/mortality". In this respect, the 
applicant was requested to provide: An analysis of responders in 6MWD, defined in absolute and 
relative terms as: i) Improvement > 30 m from baseline at study endpoint; ii) Improvement > 15% 
from baseline at study endpoint. The applicant has provided the analysis. The effect compared to 
baseline depended largely on the imputation of missing values, but the effect as compared to placebo 
was unaffected. 
There was no clinically relevant effect of selexipag on overall quality of life and on breathlessness 
as  measured  by  the  CAMPHOR  scale.  This  finding  is  not  fully  understood  since  the  clear  benefit  with 
regard  to  morbidity  events  would  be  expected  to  translate  into improved  QoL  However,  although  the 
CAMPHOR scale has been validated in small populations in different regions, it is currently not known 
whether  it  is  sensitive  to  changes  in  QoL.  Therefore,  the  lack  of  impact  of  selexipag  on  QoL  as 
measured  by  the  CAMPHOR  questionnaire  does  not  invalidate  the  beneficial  effects  of  selexipag  on 
morbidity events. 
For NT-proBNP levels median improvements on therapy vs. placebo were small. 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report 
Page 73/117 
 
 
There was no correlation between maintenance dose and the primary endpoint outcome at least for 
patients with typical AEs. This is consistent with the assumption that, on an individual level, tolerability 
correlates with efficacy. For patients without AEs typical for prostacyclin analogues efficacy was 
questionable for the lowest dose range. It may be appropriate that these patients try to increase their 
dose during therapy.  
2.5.4 Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
In summary, a statistically significant and clinically relevant benefit as measured by the primary 
endpoint has been demonstrated for patients with PAH in FC II and III, on baseline therapy or 
treatment naïve. The result was consistent for almost all of the relevant subgroups, except Asian 
patients and Asia and North America as region. Patients with idiopathic/hereditary PAH or connective 
tissue disease in FC stages II – III and patients with PAH associated with simple corrected congenital 
heart disease were sufficiently represented in the study to be reflected in the wording of an indication. 
The analysis of the results for all-cause mortality is challenging. At the primary analysis timepoint 
EOT+7d, selexipag appeared to have a negative effect on mortality as the primary endpoint 
component. This finding can be explained statistically by informative censoring. On the other hand, the   
analysis up to study closure in the FAS suggested a neutral effect and mathematical models which take 
into account cross-over even indicated an up to 25% reduction in mortality.These models have 
limitations due to assumptions that have to be made and should be interpreted with caution.  
The finding of increased all-cause mortality as primary endpoint event was mainly observed in patients 
in FC II and in those with better cardiac functioning and was paralleled by an increase in MACE events 
that also may be related to informative censoring. The safety data did not indicate a specific concern 
related to patients in FC II and there was no plausible explanation for a risk in patients in FC II and 
better cardiac functioning that would not be relevant for more vulnerable patients at a more advanced 
stage of PAH. Cross study comparisons, albeit to be taken with caution, indicated that the mortality 
rate in the selexipag arm in FC II was largely within the expected range, whereas mortality in the 
placebo arm (FCII) was low.  
Overall, CHMP considered that the finding of increased mortality as a primary endpoint event is most 
likely due to informative censoring and/or a chance finding. This assumption is supported by the 
following considerations: a) selexipag exerted beneficial effects on morbidity endpoints in patients with 
PAH and morbidity events were shown to increase the risk of dying, b) selexipag is an IP receptor 
agonist with the typical adverse event profile of the prostacyclin/prostacyclin analogues known class of 
PAH medications; prostacyclins are not suspected to be associated with an increased risk of mortality 
c) the increase in heart rate after each dose is generally modest and transient and in the range of 
other vasodilatory drugs approved for PAH, d) no specific/unique safety issue could be identified that 
could explain an increase in mortality, e) any putative safety issue leading to increased mortality would 
be more likely to become evident in PAH patients with deteriorated health condition as opposed to 
patients in FCII and better cardiac functioning. Reference is also made to the safety section of this 
report.  
The overall effect of selexipag on the 6 MWT appeared to be moderate when compared to the effects 
observed with non-prostacyclin medicinal products in a cross study comparison. However, the effect in 
treatment naïve patients was in the range of what has previously been observed and accepted as 
clinically relevant. Therefore, the mean effect was largely driven by the high number of patients (about 
80%) on baseline therapy. It is well known that only smaller effects can be expected in these patients.  
There was no improvement in quality of life as measured by the CAMPHOR scale. At present, it cannot 
be finally decided whether this is due to a low sensitivity of the test used or indicates that the clinically 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report 
Page 74/117 
 
 
relevant benefits of selexipag on morbidity events do not translate into improvements in the categories 
investigated by the test.  
Although the beneficial effects might be regarded as moderate, they are clinically relevant. As most 
patients (about 80%) in GRIPHON received selexipag on top of baseline therapy with ERAs and/or 
PDE5-inhibitors, a second line indication is considered appropriate in order not to withhold therapeutic 
use  of these drugs that have an established clinical benefit demonstrated over years in large numbers 
of patients. 
2.6  Clinical safety 
Safety information is mainly contributed by completed pivotal Phase 3 study AC-065A302 (GRIPHON) 
in the PAH indication. This study has 1152 patients in its safety data set. Beside this pivotal trial, only 
a few small Phase 2 trials with 26 to 43 patients per study were performed, in the PAH and also in the 
CTEPH (chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension) indication. Thus, safety evaluation is mostly 
based on the GRIPHON trial. GRIPHON has an ongoing, uncontrolled extension phase (i.e. all patients 
are treated with selexipag, no comparator is included).  
An independent Critical Event Committee (CEC) adjudicated all reported morbidity/mortality (MM) 
events. The CEC was blinded to the patient’s study treatment allocation and to the occurrence of 
typical prostacyclin-associated adverse events (AEs). The CEC comprised 3 clinical experts who had 
experience and expertise in the management of patients within this disease area, and experience in 
the monitoring of randomized clinical trials. The CEC members were not involved as investigators in 
the GRIPHON study. 
Patient exposure 
Exposure is described below for the double-blind period of the GRIPHON study. In the phase 1 and 
phase 2 studies patient exposure was comparably low. In study AC-065A303 (open-label extension of 
GRIPHON), median duration of study treatment (up to 10 March 2014) was 37.2 weeks (range: 0.9–
160.0 weeks), with 34.4% of patients (75/218) receiving study treatment for a cumulative duration of 
at least 1 year. 
GRIPHON study, double blind period 
Median duration of study treatment in study AC-065A302 was 70.7 weeks (range: 0.3–216.7 weeks) in 
the selexipag group compared to 63.7 weeks (range: 0.7–192.0 weeks) in the placebo group, with 
63.8% and 62.6% of patients in the respective groups receiving study treatment for a cumulative 
duration of at least 1 year. The proportion of patients who received study treatment for a cumulative 
duration of at least 2 years was 31.3% in the selexipag group and 27.4% in the placebo group. 
Thus, the mean duration of treatment was close to one and a half year in the selexipag group, and the 
majority of patients were treated for more than one year. For further details see table below.

Of the 575 selexipag-treated patients in study AC-065A302, 28.3% received selexipag at an individual 
maintenance dose (IMD) of 1600 μg bid (i.e., the maximum selexipag dose allowed in the study). In 
the placebo group, the highest number of tablets corresponding to the 1600 μg bid IMD was achieved 
by 67.5% of patients. For details see table below.

IMD is defined as the selexipag or placebo bid dose to which each patient was 
exposed for the longest duration in the maintenance period, or, for patients who did 
not enter maintenance, as the highest tolerated selexipag or placebo bid dose to 
which each patient was exposed during the titration period. 
Adverse events 
GRIPHON study, double blind period (AC-065A302) 
A total of 98.3% and 96.9% of patients in the selexipag and placebo groups, respectively, had at least 
1 AE in study AC-065A302 (i.e. GRIPHON, double blind period). The Applicant defined certain AEs as 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report

“prostacyclin-associated AEs” which included pain in various defined locations, flushing and several 
gastrointestinal effects. These AEs were also defined as AEs of special interest. These prostacyclin-
associated AEs, together with the related AEs abdominal pain and neck pain, were the most frequently 
reported AEs and had markedly higher frequencies in the selexipag group compared to the placebo 
group. Other salient AEs reported more frequently on selexipag compared to placebo included 
hypotension (5.0% vs 3.1%), anaemia (8.3% vs 5.4%), hyperthyroidism (1.4% vs. 0%) and acute 
renal failure (2.4% vs 1.2%).  
On the level of SOC (System Organ Class), skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders revealed an 
imbalance. Respective events were reported for 19.7% of patients in the selexipag group compared to 
15.8% in the placebo group. This difference was mainly driven by rash (4.5% selexipag, 2.8% 
placebo) and erythema (2.3% vs. 1.4%). Furthermore, Eye disorders were reported for 11.0% of 
patients in the selexipag group compared to 8.0% in the placebo groups. This difference was mainly 
driven by the PT “Eye Pain” (1.6% vs. 0.3%). 
On the other hand, PAH (worsening) and right ventricular failure were reported less frequently in the 
selexipag group (21.9% and 8.0% of patients, respectively) compared to the placebo group (35.7% 
and 10.1%, respectively). Similarly, other manifestations of underlying PAH disease were also reported 
less frequently in the selexipag group compared to placebo: dyspnoea (16.0% vs 21.0%), peripheral 
oedema (13.9% vs 18.0%), and syncope (6.4% vs 8.8%). 
Taken together, most of the AEs which were more frequent in the selexipag group are most likely 
related to the PD effect of selexipag (the so-called prostacyclin-associated AEs as well as hypotension). 
Beside these, salient differences between selexipag and placebo were observed for anaemia, 
hyperthyroidism and acute renal failure. These conditions are further discussed as AEs of special 
interest below. 
Nasopharyngitis and influenza were also more frequent with selexipag, but infections and infestations 
in total were well balanced between selexipag and placebo. Thus, there is no hint that selexipag affects 
the immune system.

In study AC-065A302, AEs of mild and moderate intensity were reported for 8.2% and 41.0% of 
patients, respectively, in the selexipag group and 8.8% and 42.8% of patients, respectively, in the 
placebo group. Severe intensity AEs were reported for 49.0% and 44.9% of patients in the selexipag 
and placebo groups, respectively. The most frequently reported severe AE was PAH (14.4% selexipag, 
21.0% placebo). 
Investigator-attributed relationship of adverse events to study treatment 
In study AC-065A302, 89.6% of patients in the selexipag group had at least 1 AE which was 
considered by the investigator to be treatment-related compared to 56.7% in the placebo group. 
Prostacyclin-associated AEs were the events most frequently considered by the investigator to be 
treatment-related. Other individual PT AEs considered treatment-related and reported more frequently 
in the selexipag group compared to the placebo group included decreased appetite (3.5% vs 1.4%), 
pain (2.4% vs 0.5%), and decreased weight (1.0% vs 0%). 
GRIPHON study, open label period (AC-065A303) 
Of the 218 patients who were enrolled and received selexipag in study AC-065A303, 209 (95.9%) had 
at least 1 AE. Similar to AC-065A302, prostacyclin-associated AEs (i.e., headache, diarrhoea, jaw pain, 
nausea, vomiting, pain in extremity, myalgia, arthralgia, and flushing) were the most frequently 
reported AEs in AC-065A303. PAH (worsening) and right ventricular failure were reported for 25.7% 
and 16.5% of patients, respectively. Other frequently reported AEs included peripheral oedema 
(11.5%), anaemia (5.5%), hypotension (4.6%), and decreased appetite (4.1%). For further AEs see 
table below. No placebo arm was included in this open-label period. 
Thus, AEs probably related to prostacyclin physiology were also frequent in the uncontrolled extension 
period of the GRIPHON study. Other events can be related to the underlying disease or accompanying 
medication. This study period gives no hint for undesired effects of selexipag that were not yet 
detected in the double blind period.

AEs of special interest 
The AEs of special interest included those expected to be observed with selexipag based on its 
mechanism of action i.e., prostacyclin-associated AEs, hypotension, and haemorrhage (also of 
increased risk in PAH, particularly in patients receiving anticoagulants and anti-platelet agents) and 
AEs of potential risk identified from preclinical studies with selexipag i.e., eye disorders (retinal 
vasculature impairment). Furthermore, malignancies and signs of drug-induced liver injury were 
regarded as AEs of special interest. In addition, AEs which were found to be more frequent with 
selexipag than with placebo were discussed by the Applicant in further detail, namely anaemia, renal 
failure (including other renal disorders for completeness) and hyperthyroidism. 
In case of hypotension, a mechanistic link is likely based on theoretical considerations (prostacyclin-
mediated vasodilation). Reassuringly, the incidence of serious hypotension events was balanced 
between selexipag and placebo. 
For renal failure, a causal relationship to selexipag treatment remained unclear. Not all events were 
regarded serious; e.g. temporal worsening of chronic renal failure was considered non-serious. For 
serious events of acute renal failure, the imbalance was smaller (10 patients with selexipag vs. 7 
patients with placebo). 
Malignancies and MACE are described in more detail in the following. For the other AEs of special 
interest the closer analysis did not reveal new insights and is therefore not presented. No relevant 
differences between selexipag and placebo were detected for haemorrhage. 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report 
Page 79/117 
 
 
Malignancies 
Malignancy AEs were reported for 11 patients (14 AEs) in the selexipag group versus 4 patients (4 
AEs) in the placebo group. All events were considered by the investigator to be unrelated to study 
drug. The events were reported as serious in 7 patients (8 events) in the selexipag group and 4 
patients (4 events) in the placebo group. There was a salient imbalance in light-dependent skin 
tumours (basalioma and keratoacanthoma) in the selexipag vs. placebo group (five tumours in four 
patients of the selexipag group, none in the placebo group). 
PAH can be associated with autoimmune disease so that some patients received immunosuppressant 
medication prior or during the study. However, no relevant differences between the selexipag and the 
placebo group become obvious. 
It is known that sunlight exposure can play a role in the formation of the types of skin tumours which 
were observed in the selexipag group. Simultaneously, selexipag was found to be potentially 
phototoxic in an in-vitro screening test (see Non-clinical AR). The Applicant aimed to confirm or 
exclude phototoxicity of selexipag in a dedicated Phase 1 study AC-065-102 (see Pharmacology section 
for details).  
However, this study is not informative since the positive control did not yield the expected results. 
Cardiovascular events 
There was a numerical imbalance in serious and total Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) in 
the selexipag vs. the placebo group in the GRIPHON study (double blind period), in disfavour of 
selexipag. A mechanistic link to selexipag action is not immediately obvious since prostacyclin inhibits 
platelet aggregation which could even have a protective effect. The analysis of MACE is summarized in 
the table below. The overall proportion of patients with such events was 2.4% in the selexipag group 
and 1.4% in the placebo group. Corrected for exposure, the average annualized event rate was 0.015 
and 0.010 for selexipag and placebo, respectively. No specific leading cause of MACE was identified; 
see the two following tables for details.

The numbers of fatal events as a component of the primary endpoint were 25 (4.4%) and 16 (2.7%) in 
the selexipag and placebo groups, respectively. However, due to the competing nature of 
morbidity/mortality events considered for the primary endpoint, informative censoring takes place, and 
these numbers should be interpreted with caution (see Efficacy and B/R part of this report for detailled 
explanation and discussion of informative censoring).

Overall, a total of 46 deaths (8.0%) and 37 deaths (6.4%) in the selexipag and placebo groups, 
respectively, were reported up to EOT + 7 days. Among these, a similar proportion (71.7% vs 73.0%) 
in the selexipag and placebo group, respectively, were adjudicated as PAH-related by the CEC. At 
Study closure, the number of deaths was similar in the selexipag and placebo groups (100 [17.4%] 
and 105 [18.0%] respectively). The proportion of patients who died due to PAH was 12.2% and 14.3% 
in the selexipag and placebo groups, respectively. For further details see table below.

The treatment duration was somewhat longer in selexipag vs. placebo patients (mean 76.4 vs. 71.2 
weeks, see Section 4.2 “Patient exposure” above). The hazard ratio for mortality for the treatment 
period was 1.17, as stated in the Kaplan-Meier plot below.  
Figure 1-87  Appendix 2: Kaplan-Meier estimates of time from randomization to CEC 
confirmed death up to AC-065A302 EOT + 7 days, FAS 
Most of the fatal events were regarded as cardiac death (38 of 46 in the selexipag group and 29 of 
37 in the plc group).

The imbalance in overall mortality and cardiac deaths was restricted to patients in FC I/II, see table 
below.

adjudication by independent cardiologist and CEC) by WHO FC at baseline, AC-065A302, FAS 
CEC = Critical Event Committee; EOT = End of treatment; FAS = Full analysis set; FC = functional 
class 
 Otherwise, major deviations of a subgroup HR from the all patient HR were only observed for small 
subgroups in which, due to the low patient number, a high degree of uncertainty resulted. 
The Applicant also provided a Kaplan-Meier plot (see below) of survival restricted to patients with 
“typical PAH”, whereby Typical PAH is defined as PAH in patients who had no co-morbidity that might 
have introduced a doubt on the aetiology of PAH. It turned out that this large subgroup of patients also 
had a higher mortality in the selexipag group; the HR was 1.28 and thereby numerically even higher 
than in all patients (HR 1.17).

typical or consistent PAH 
An independent analysis investigated the influence of several baseline factors on mortality. A 
significant association was found for cardiac index (CI), whereby the interaction was complex. The 
Kaplan-Meier plot below visualises mortality over time for patients with low (25th percentile, marked 
"Q1" in the figure) and high (75th percentile, marked "Q3" in the figure) CI, having received selexipag 
or placebo. The placebo group meets the expectations in that mortality was higher with low cardiac 
index (Q1) than with high CI (Q3). With selexipag, mortality decreased in the low-CI group but clearly 
increased in the high-CI group. The reason for this effect in the high-CI-group is not clear.

Increased mortality with higher CI (>Q3) is also clearly visible in the Forest plot analysis shown below.

In search for potential explanations of the observed numerically higher mortality with selexipag up to 
EOT+7d, the applicant performed two independent mathematical modelling approaches (for details 
see section 3.4.5 Clinical Efficacy). Assuming selexipag to have a beneficial effect non-fatal events and 
a neutral effect on mortality, the results of the mathematic models fitted the observed difference in 
deaths  very well. In particular, the simulation in the first model showed on average 38 deaths for 
placebo and 46 deaths for selexipag, compared to the observed 37 and 46 deaths, respectively. The 
probability of observing more deaths with selexipag compared to placebo was 79% and of observing 
an excess of 9 or more deaths was 45%. In the second model, the likelihood of observing more 
deaths in the selexipag arm up to EOT+7d was also high, ranging from 60–81%. The expected 
difference ranged from 3.0 to 7.8, and the probability of observing a difference of 9 or more deaths 
between treatment arms up to EOT+7d was 26–47%. This model considered three scenarios of 
acceleration of the death process by an endpoint event. Hence, the probabilities are given as ranges 
covering the three scenarios. 
SAEs 
In AC-065A302, 43.8% and 47.1% of patients in the selexipag and placebo groups, respectively, had 
at least 1 SAE (see table below), i.e. SAEs were numerically lower with selexipag than with placebo. 
PAH worsening and right ventricular failure were the most frequently reported SAEs, and both were 
reported at lower frequencies in the selexipag group (14.4% and 5.9%, respectively) compared to the 
placebo group (22.0% and 7.1%, respectively). Other SAEs reported at lower frequencies in the 
selexipag group included pneumonia (3.0% selexipag, 4.3% placebo) and syncope (1.7% selexipag, 
3.5% placebo). The SAE “right ventricular failure” was less frequent in the selexipag group which is 
well in line with the efficacy finding of slowing of PAH progression

The percentage of patients with AEs with fatal outcome was larger in the selexipag than in the placebo 
group (on-treatment), see table below. This is in line with the numerically increased mortality 
described above, subsection “Deaths”. PAH or cardiopulmonary failure as causes of death were more 
frequently reported with selexipag than with placebo, despite an overall slowed disease progression.

The adjudication of death cases was made separately by the CEC and by an external expert 
cardiologist. Combining the adjudications identified 7 cases of sudden cardiac death (6 selexipag, 1 
placebo) not related to PAH (up to EOT + 7 days). Most of the six patients in the selexipag group had 
pre-existing CV disease beyond PAH.  
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Mean absolute changes from baseline to regular visits in haemoglobin ranged from −3.4 to −0.6 g/L in 
the selexipag group compared to −0.6 to 3.0 g/L in the placebo group of the GRIPHON study. Mean 
absolute change from baseline to regular visits in platelet count ranged from 3.1 to 9.7 GI/L in the 
selexipag group compared to −4.6 to 2.2 GI/L in the placebo group. There were no changes from 
baseline in mean haematocrit, erythrocyte and leukocyte counts in the two groups. However, markedly 
decreased Hb was more frequently reported as an AE in the selexipag as compared to the placebo 
group (<80 g/L, 1.3% vs.0.7%; <100 g/L, 8.8% vs. 5.0%). There was also an increased frequency of 
reported decreases in leukocyte count in the selexipag group (<2.0 G/L, 0.9% vs. 0.2%; <3.0 G/L, 
5.0% vs. 2.0%). 
Serum Chemistry 
There were 2.5% of patients in the selexipag group and 1.4% in the placebo group reporting 
decreased potassium to <3.0 mmol/L. No relevant differences between selexipag and placebo in mean 
potassium level were observed. There was one patient in the selexipag group who had study drug dose 
reduction due to hypokalaemia. Otherwise no relevant imbalances between the groups disfavouring 
selexipag were observed. 
Vital signs 
Heart rate and ECG 
At the Month 12 visit, an ECG at 2 and 4 h post-dose was performed. Median HR was 74.0 and 72.0 
bpm in the selexipag and placebo groups, respectively, at pre-dose at Month 12. The mean change 
from pre-dose in HR at 2 h post-dose was 5.4 bpm and 2.1 bpm for selexipag and placebo, 
respectively. At 4 h post-dose, the mean change from pre-dose value was smaller than after 2 hours 
for selexipag, 3.7 bpm. Changes in the PR interval were consistent with the observed HR changes. No 
meaningful changes in QRS duration and the QTcF interval were observed at 2 and 4 h post-dose ECG 
recordings. 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report 
Page 86/117 
 
 
 
  
 
Categorical heart rate analysis of the GRIPHON trial data (see table below) revealed a higher 
percentage of patients with a HR increase of >10, >15 or >20 bpm 2 hours after dosing in the 
selexipag compared to the plc group (see Table 18 below). 
Table 18 from the Response Document: Categorical change in heart rate post-dose vs pre-
dose at Month 12 (ECG), AC-065A302, SAF 
*Selexipag vs. placebo for increased heart rate 
Blood pressure 
A higher percentage of patients in the selexipag than in the placebo group of GRIPHON (double blind 
period) revealed low SBP (<90 mmHg), 9.7% vs. 6.7%, in line with the observed increased incidence 
in hypotension. No meaningful changes in mean blood pressure were observed in GRIPHON. In the 
selexipag group, mean changes from baseline in SBP ranged from -2.0 to 1.5 mmHg compared to -1.3 
to 0.0 mmHg in the placebo group; DBP: -1.6 to -0.1 mmHg vs. -1.1 to 0.3 mmHg. 
Bone turnover markers 
Because of bone findings in animals (increased ossification in dogs, characterized by periosteal bone 
formation and increased thickness and numbers of trabeculae), bone turnover markers were assessed 
in study AC-065A302 (i.e. double blind period of GRIPHON). Mean absolute changes from baseline in 
bone specific alkaline phosphatase and carboxyterminal telopeptide showed no consistent pattern in 
either group. Thus, no hints for bone effects in humans were detected. The Applicant also had 
performed mechanistic studies in animals which make a dog-specific effect likely.  
Safety in special populations 
Age: The safety analysis set comprised 476 patients aged < 65 years treated with selexipag (709 
patient-years) vs 470 treated with placebo (638 patient-years), and 91 patients aged 65–74 years 
treated with selexipag (116 patient-years) vs 102 treated with placebo (137 patient-years). The 
number of patients ≥ 75 years old was low (8 selexipag, 5 placebo) and insufficient to allow 
meaningful evaluation of AEs in this age group. The overall AE frequency was 97.5% and 100% in the 
selexipag group and 97.0% and 96.1% in the placebo group for patients aged < 65 years and 65–74 
years, respectively. The pattern of AEs was generally similar in patients aged < 65 years and in those 
aged 65–74 years, although some differences in the frequency of individual AEs was observed. A 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report 
Page 87/117 
 
 
 
higher frequency of prostacyclin AEs leading to discontinuation of selexipag treatment was reported for 
patients aged between 65 and 75. 
Regarding other special populations, the Applicant provided AE listings for several demographic factors, 
type of PAH and background medication. No special concerns became obvious. No safety information 
on patients with liver or kidney disease was provided. 
Patients with relevant renal or hepatic impairment were rare in the GRIPHON study so that safety 
evaluation of these subgroups is not possible.

In the GRIPHON study, double blind period, there were three cases (0.5%) of hypersensitivity reported 
in the selexipag group vs. four cases (0.7%) in the placebo group. In total, immune system disorders 
were reported in 1.9% vs. 3.8% of patients (selexipag vs. placebo) in this study. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The Applicant provided AE listings stratified for the different accompanying PAH treatments. No marked 
differences according to accompanying PAH medication can be detected. The AE profile was similar 
under all conditions, with an increase of gastrointestinal AEs, pain in various locations and 
rash/flushing increased in the selexipag groups vs. placebo. Interaction was more closely studied for 
hypotension. The triple combination of selexipag, ERA and PDE5i produced the highest rate of 
hypotension.  
Discontinuation due to AES 
A total of 31.7% of patients in the selexipag group had at least 1 AE leading to discontinuation of study 
drug in study AC-065A302 compared to 37.1% in the placebo group. The most frequently reported AE 
leading to discontinuation of study drug was PAH worsening (13.6% selexipag, 23.4% placebo). The 
proportion of patients who discontinued due to right ventricular failure was 2.4% in the selexipag 
group and 4.0% in the placebo group. Hence, a marked difference in discontinuation due to PAH was 
observed in favour of selexipag. This again indicates that selexipag can influence PAH progression 
positively. Conversely, more patients in the selexipag group than in the placebo group discontinued 
due to presumably prostacyclin-related effects. The total discontinuation rate was higher in the placebo 
group.  
2.6.1 Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety information is mainly based on the double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period of the 
pivotal phase 3 study GRIPHON. Nearly all patients had at least one AE in the selexipag as well as in 
the placebo group. However, there was a set of characteristic AEs which were markedly more frequent 
with selexipag than with placebo. These AEs included various gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, pain at 
various locations and flushing. Furthermore, mean heart rate was increased for a few hours after each 
administration of selexipag (mean 3.3 bpm vs. placebo) whereas mean systemic blood pressure was 
hardly affected; however, events of hypotension were more frequent with selexipag than with placebo. 
All these mentioned signs and symptoms are in line with the PD action of selexipag, i.e. activation of 
the IP receptor. The Applicant therefore used the term “prostacyclin-associated AEs” to describe this 
set of AEs. 
Furthermore, a slight imbalance of acute renal failure, disfavouring selexipag, was observed. Renal and 
urinary disorders reported as previous or concomitant diseases higher in the selexipag group (13.1%) 
than in the placebo group (10.3%). However, it cannot fully be excluded that the prostacyclin-like 
action of selexipag could worsen renal function because of the complex effects of prostaglandins on 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report 
Page 88/117 
 
 
various organs. Thus, "renal function impairment" / "acute renal failure" have been listed as important 
potential risks in the RMP. 
Regarding SAEs, the total percentage of patients with at least one serious AE was numerically lower in 
the selexipag than in the placebo group. This was mainly driven by the markedly lower incidence of 
(worsening of) PAH in the selexipag group and was in line with the findings of the efficacy analysis. An 
analysis of MACE events revealed an increase of them in the selexipag group. The imbalance in MACE 
is essentially due to the imbalance in CV deaths because most of the MACE were fatal. Sudden death 
and death due to heart failure were most frequent. MACE have been listed as important potential risks 
in the RMP. 
Until the end of treatment (EOT)+7 days, mortality was numerically higher in the selexipag group 
compared to the placebo group (46 vs. 37 cases, HR 1.17). The imbalance was due to cardiovascular 
death; non-CV death was fairly balanced between the groups. Notably, the difference between 
selexipag and placebo was largest for deaths as part of the primary endpoint. This means that in the 
selexipag group more often than in the placebo group death occurred without prior signs of PAH 
worsening. This could indicate a merely symptomatic improvement by selexipag treatment without 
affecting mortality. However, in their response the Applicant submitted a further analysis which also 
included worsening of right heart function as a parameter for PAH progression as suggested in the 
relevant CHMP guideline and with this analysis the number of deaths as first event decreased in the 
selexipag group so that no relevant difference between selexipag and placebo remained (see efficacy 
part of this report). 
Analysis of mortality (as first event) is biased by informative censoring (see Efficacy and B/R part of 
this report). Since presence of informative censoring does not rule out a true increase, a careful search 
for mechanisms by which selexipag could potentially adversely affect mortality was performed. It was 
observed that increased mortality with selexipag as compared to placebo was limited to patients with 
FC II at baseline and with a cardiac index (CI) in the highest quartile. Cardiac index (CI) was found to 
be significantly correlated with survival under selexipag treatment. Analyses suggested that selexipag 
increases survival in low-CI patients but decreases survival in the high-CI patients, which is an 
implausible biological and clinical finding. Furthermore, cross study comparisons suggested that the 
mortality rate on selexipag in patients with FCII was not higher than expected, whereas the mortality 
rate in FC II on placebo was remarkably low. No safety signal, overall or specifically related to FC II, 
was detected and there is no clinical rationale why patients in functional class II with better cardiac 
function should be more sensitive to a putative harmful effect of selexipag than patients in FC III/IV 
with deteriorated cardiac function making a causal relationship between the observed increased 
mortality and selexipag in the first event analysis  is highly unlikely.The numerical increase in deaths 
up to end of treatment + 7 days but not up to study closure was further investigated by mathematical 
modelling, showing that the imbalance in deaths is consistent with the assumption of a neutral effect 
on PAH mortality and reduction of non-fatal events (reference is made to section 3.4.5 Clinical 
Efficacy). 
Regarding vital signs, a transient and small increase in mean heart rate (HR; around 3 bpm vs. plc) 
was noted after dosing of selexipag compared to placebo in the pivotal GRIPHON trial. 
Correspondingly, higher percentages of patients had increases in HR >10, > 15 or > 20 bpm with 
selexipag compared to placebo. Although changes in heart rate were generally modest and similar to 
those seen with other medicinal products approved for PAH, HR increases could be relevant in 
vulnerable patients. Therefore, patients at high risk of experiencing cardiovascular events have been 
excluded from treatment by including the iloprost contraindications (e.g. severe coronary artery 
disease, status post myocardial infarction, unstable angina) into the SmPC of selexipag.  
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report 
Page 89/117 
 
 
Malignancies were found to be numerically more frequent in the selexipag group of the GRIPHON trial 
(11 vs. 4 patients, selexipag vs. placebo). The surplus in the selexipag group is mainly due to skin 
tumours which did not occur at all in the placebo group. Phototoxicity of selexipag and its metabolite 
ACT-333679 was observed in non-clinical in-vitro screening tests and could not be excluded in a 
dedicated trial. However, the Applicant pointed out that no signs of phototoxicity were observed in the 
patients suffering skin tumours and that the incidence observed in the selexipag group is well within 
the expectations based on the frequency of these tumours in the general population. Thus, a chance 
finding is likely as the absolute number of cases was low. Of note, light-dependent non-melanoma skin 
malignancies are listed as important potential risks in the RMP. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2 Conclusions on clinical safety 
The applicant has provided mathematical models and simulations that can explain the finding of a 
numerically higher rate of deaths in the first overall event analysis as a result of informative censoring. 
These show that the finding of an imbalance for death as first event up to EOT or EOT+7d is not 
unexpected under the assumption that selexipag decreases non-fatal but not fatal events. For further 
details see efficacy part of this report. 
No specific/unique safety issue could be identified that could explain an increase in mortality with 
selexipag. In addition, any putative safety issue leading to increased mortality would be more likely to 
become evident in PAH patients with poor health condition as opposed to patients in FCII and better 
cardiac functioning. Therefore, the observed  increased mortality in the primary MM endpoint analysis 
is most likely due to informative censoring and/or a chance finding and lacks biological or clinical 
plausibility. Hence, CHMP considered the mortality issue as satisfactorily addressed. 
The CHMP considered acceptable to further monitor   the safety profile as mentioned in the RMP, in the 
clinical use setting as a post authorisation study included in the RMP.  
In reference to the safety profile it is also agreed with the implementation of risk minimisation 
activities as proposed by the applicant and reflected into the Marketing Authorisation (see below for 
details).

Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of 
selexipag in pregnant women. Animal 
studies do not indicate direct or indirect 
harmful effects with respect to 
reproductive toxicity. Selexipag and its 
main metabolite showed 20- to 80-times 
lower prostacyclin (IP) receptor potency 
in vitro in animal species used in 
reproductive toxicity testing compared to 
humans. Therefore, safety margins for 
potential IP receptor-mediated effects on

PK described in section 5.2: 
‘Hepatic impairment 
In subjects with mild (Child-Pugh class A) 
or moderate (Child-Pugh class B) hepatic 
impairment, exposure to selexipag was 
2- and 4-fold higher, respectively, when 
compared to healthy subjects. Exposure 
to the active metabolite remained almost 
unchanged in subjects with mild hepatic

with moderate hepatic impairment. Only 
two subjects with severe (Child-Pugh

the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2 Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Uptravi (selexipag) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that

this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
The application is based on one pivotal clinical study (GRIPHON) which was an endpoint-driven trial 
that investigated the effect of selexipag on morbidity and mortality with onset date up to 7 days after 
last study drug intake in patients with PAH. The primary composite endpoint included the components 
death (all causes), hospitalization for worsening of PAH based on predefined criteria, worsening of PAH 
resulting in need for lung transplantation or balloon atrial septostomy, initiation of parenteral 
prostanoid therapy or chronic oxygen therapy due to worsening of PAH and confirmed disease 
progression. Disease progression was defined by a decrease in the 6 Minute Walk Test (MWT) by at 
least 15% that is accompanied either by a) Worsening of NYHA/WHO Functional Class (FC) (patients in 
FC II-III) or by b) Need for additional PAH-specific therapy (patients in FC III-(patients in FC III-IV). 
Right heart failure, an endpoint component proposed in the relevant CHMP PAH guideline, was not part 
of the composite endpoint.  Median duration of double-blind study treatment was 70.7 weeks for the 
selexipag and 63.7 weeks for the placebo group. After a primary morbidity/mortality event, patients 
could enter an extension phase and either remain on selexipag, discontinue treatment or switch from 
placebo to selexipag. 
Beneficial effects 
A statistically significant and clinically relevant benefit of selexipag vs. placebo has been demonstrated 
for the composite primary morbidity and mortality endpoint (24.4% vs. 36.4%, 140 vs. 212 patients 
with morbidity and mortality endpoint event. This beneficial effect was driven by a positive effect on 
“disease progression” and “hospitalization due to PAH worsening”. There was no beneficial effect on all-
cause mortalityor quality of life. 
A small beneficial effect was also observed for the 6 Minute Walk Test (-53 m vs. -66m). This effect 
was more pronounced in patients with Functional Class III than in those with Functional Class II and in 
treatment naïve patients comparedwas estimated to be larger [difference of +34 m vs. placebo at the 
pre-defined timepoint of 6 months (99% CI: 10.0; 63.0, p = 0.0002)] than in patients pretreated with 
ERA, PDEi or ERA+ PDEi (Point estimate and two-sided 99% CI for location shift, Hodges-Lehman 
method -1 (-38.0; 28.0 m), +12.0 (-8.0; 33.0m), and +6.0 (-14.0; 24.0 m), respectively)]. In 
patients with FC III/(IV) the difference was larger (+17.0 (-1.0; 36m) than in patients with FC (I)/II 
(+5.0 (-8.0; 19.0 m)). 
Overall, a benefit has been shown in adult patients with IPAH or PAH due to connective tissue disease, 
in PAH associated with simple corrected congenital heart disease in WHO Functional Class II and III 
either as combination therapy in patients insufficiently controlled with an endothelin receptor 
antagonist (ERA) and/or a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitor, or as monotherapy in  patients 
who are not candidates for these therapies.  Maintenance of the effect has been sufficiently 
demonstrated over time since it was a long-term endpoint-driven trial. 
Selexipag will be the first orally available prostacyclin (PGI2) receptor agonist in the EU. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The GRIPHON trial was not designed to investigate whether selexipag has disease modifying activity 
with maintenance of an effect after cessation of therapy.  
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report 
Page 103/117 
 
 
Due to low numbers of patients in Functional Class I and IV included in GRIPHON study, efficacy in 
these functional classes cannot be reliably assessed. Thus, these patients are not included in the 
indication. 
The individual components of the primary endpoint were assessed as secondary endpoints. Results 
were all in favour of selexipag except for mortality, which was numerically increased with selexipag 
compared to placebo (4.9% vs. 3.1%, 28 vs. 18 events at EOT+7 days follow up).  
The observation of increased mortality in this analysis is prone to bias, and in consequence the event 
rates above are potentially misleading, firstly the trial was event-driven and patient follow-up 
contributing to the primary assessment of mortality ceased after their first primary outcome event, 
which was usually a disease progression (morbidity) event. After a first morbidity event, patients were 
allowed to cross over to another treatment: patients could remain on selexipag, discontinue treatment 
or switch from placebo to selexipag.  Experiencing a morbidity event was associated with a higher risk 
of dying. Since more morbidity events occurred in the placebo group, more patients at high risk were 
excluded from further follow-up in the placebo group than in the selexipag group with a consequence 
that follow-up is shorter in the placebo group and follow-up from more patients that are at higher risk 
is excluded from the placebo group, resulting in bias. Observation of the patient is ‘censored’ when 
follow-up is discontinued according to the protocolled definition, and because the risk for those patients 
is probably increased, the censoring is termed ‘informative’ for outcome (patients at increased risk are 
more likely to be censored). In other words, due to the study design, the risk profile of the patients 
changed during the course of the study, favouring placebo group at the end of the trial despite of 
randomization. This is consistent with the observation that the imbalance did not emerge before month 
18.  
To explore the impact of these phenomena, mathematical simulations were conducted simulating the 
trial design under scenarios assuming a beneficial effect of treatment on morbidity and a neutral effect 
on mortality.  These simulations indicated that, in a scenario where the placebo arm has increased 
‘informative censoring’, there is a chance of at least a 70% to observe more deaths on selexipag and a 
chance of 26% to 47% to observe a large difference of 9 or more deaths. 
As stated above, the follow-up time on treatment was longer in the selexipag vs. the placebo group 
(median 70.7 vs. 63.7 weeks, respectively.  Adjustment for the difference in follow-up time (‘at risk 
period’) reduces but does not remove the numerical difference in mortality: estimated mortality rate 
(deaths per 100 patient years) is 5.45 in the selexipag and 4.64 in the placebo group, yielding a 
hazard ratio (HR) of 1.17. However, this adjustment assumes a constant risk over time, whereas in 
fact it can be understood that risks changed over time to a different degree in both arms.  
The observed  unfavourable effect on mortality as a primary endpoint event was less prominent when 
signs and symptoms of right heart failure were also taken into account as proposed by the relevant 
CHMP guideline on development of PAH medication (2.4% vs. 2.1%, 14 vs. 12 events, selexipag vs. 
placebo, respectively). At study closure, mortality was comparable between treatment groups (100 vs. 
105 cases for selexipag vs. placebo, respectively) but this comparison is hampered by the possibility of 
open label cross-over to another treatment after the first morbidity event. 
Of note, subgroup analyses for mortality indicated that the imbalance favouring placebo at EOT+7d 
analysis was restricted to patients in Functional Class I/II (HR 1.7 [99% CI 0.59,4.91] and to patients 
with cardiac index in the highest quartile as opposed to patients in Functional Class III/IV and patients 
with low cardiac index.  This is hence not suggestive of a true effect of selexipag on mortality due to 
lack of biological or clinical plausibility. No safety issues were identified for selexipag that could explain 
an increased mortality. (see safety section).

Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety information is mainly based on the double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period of the 
pivotal phase 3 study GRIPHON. The safety dataset of this study encompassed 1152 patients. Around 
63% of patients were treated for at least one year. 
Nearly all patients of the selexipag and of the placebo group had at least one AE during the double-
blind period of the GRIPHON study. There was a set of characteristic AEs which were markedly more 
frequent with selexipag than with placebo. These AEs included various gastrointestinal (GI) 
symptoms, pain at various locations and flushing. Furthermore, mean heart rate was increased after 
administration of selexipag whereas mean systemic blood pressure was hardly affected; however, 
events of hypotension were more frequent with selexipag than with placebo. All these events are in 
line with the pharmacodynamic action of selexipag, i.e. activation of the IP receptor, and with the AE 
profile of other prostacyclin (analogues). Beside these, a slight imbalance in anaemia, acute renal 
failure and hyperthyroidism, both disfavouring selexipag, was observed.  
Serious AEs (SAEs) during the double-blind treatment period were numerically lower in the selexipag 
than in the placebo group (43.8% vs. 47.1%). The difference was mainly due to the lower incidence of 
(worsening of) PAH in the selexipag group, which was in line with the findings of the efficacy analysis. 
Within the SAE analysis, SAEs with fatal outcome were reported more frequently in the selexipag 
than in the placebo group (8.5% vs. 7.1%). The imbalance was mainly due to increased reports of 
PAH-related fatal events in the selexipag group (e.g. worsening of PAH, right ventricular failure or 
cardiopulmonary failure); this reflects the mortality findings at EOT+7 days in the efficacy analysis. 
Major Cardiovascular Events (MACE) were also increased in the selexipag group as compared to 
placebo (7.1% vs. 5.7%, up to End of Treatment + 7 days). Most of the observed MACE were fatal; 
sudden death and death due to heart failure were the most frequent categories. 
Laboratory findings (vital signs) included an increased heart rate (HR) for about 3 hours after each 
injection (i.e. twice daily). The increase was 5.4 bpm in the selexipag group vs. 2.1 bpm in the placebo 
group. Correspondingly, the number of patients with transient HR increases >10, >15, or >20 bpm 
was higher on selexipag than on placebo (10.5% vs. 3.1% for HR increase between >15 and 20 bpm, 
5.9% vs. 2.3% for HR increase >20 bpm, selexipag vs. plc, measured 2h post-dose).  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
All-cause mortality was numerically higher in the selexipag group during the on-treatment period 
(median 70.7 and 63.7 weeks for the selexipag and placebo group, respectively). The treatment 
difference was largest for deaths that were considered as primary endpoint event (4.9% vs. 3.1%, Full 
Analysis Set).  Due to study design and endpoint definition, the mortality results are prone to bias. For 
details see efficacy section above and discussion section below. 
Only few patients aged 75 or above were present in the main safety database (GRIPHON study, 
double-blind period). Therefore, safety information on this population is limited. Limited data are also 
provided in patients with hepatic insufficiency.  
Hypotension was more frequent with selexipag. Data on the influence of accompanying PAH medication 
is not fully conclusive. 
The significance of the observed imbalance in acute renal failure is not clear. Further investigation of 
the individual cases did not suggest an underlying mechanism; however, a direct effect of selexipag on 
the kidney via its prostacyclin-like mode of action cannot be excluded. Therefore, "renal function 
impairment / acute renal failure" are listed in the RMP as important potential risks.

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
There is a medical need for new medicinal products for the treatment of PAH, in particular in the add-
on treatment. Despite of available treatment options, PAH continues to be a life-threatening and 
debilitating disease. Currently, only parenteral or inhaled prostacyclin (analogues) are available and 
difficulties and undesired effects associated with their administration frequency and/or route of 
administration are stated to result in under treatment (Lang IM, Eur Respir Rev 2015). Therefore, an 
orally available prostacyclin (IP) receptor agonist such as selexipag would be a valuable addition 
to the armamentarium of medicinal products for the treatment of PAH. 
Selexipag was shown to provide a statistically significant and clinically relevant reduction of morbidity 
events in patients with PAH. An improvement in survival has not been demonstrated. However, a 
mortality benefit is not a requirement for approval and has not been demonstrated for any of the 
approved specific PAH medications (except for i.v. epoprostenol in a small short-term study, Barst RJ, 
New Eng J Med 1996). Cross study comparisons, although to be interpreted with caution due to 
different patient populations, study designs, study durations and endpoints in most of these studies, 
suggest that efficacy of selexipag may be somewhat lower than that of non-prostacyclin PAH-specific 
medications. However, the treatment benefit of selexipag in itself as determined in GRIPHON is 
statistically significant and clinically relevant. 
The overall effect of selexipag on the 6MWD appears moderate. However, taking into consideration 
the clinically relevant effect in treatment naive patients that was in the range of other medicinal 
products approved for PAH and the well known observation that the effect on the 6 MWD is much less 
pronounced in pretreated patients (about 80% of patients in GRIPHON were pretreated with one or two 
PAH medications), the moderate mean overall effect on 6-MWD observed in the study is mainly related 
to the high number of pretreated patients included in the study but does not indicate an overall lack of 
efficacy. 
Despite a clear effect on morbidity, no improvement in quality of life (QoL) could be shown for 
selexipag compared to placebo. This lack of association is difficult to explain since even a merely 
symptomatic effect would be expected to result in an improved QoL scale. Although the CAMPHOR 
(Cambridge Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review) questionnaire used in GRIPHON has been 
validated in mainly small populations with PAH in different regions, it is unclear at present whether it is 
sensitive to changes in QoL. Therefore, the lack of impact of selexipag on QoL as measured by the 
CAMPHOR questionnaire does not invalidate the beneficial effects on morbidity events. 
The observed increased mortality as a primary endpoint event on selexipag compared to placebo was 
the most serious concern raised during the review of this application and for the conclusion on benefit 
risk. The observation is plausibly explained by differences in duration of exposure and (as 
demonstrated in the simulations) by informative censoring. Based on statistical analyses and 
simulations, analyses of the safety characteristics and supported by cross study comparisons, a true 
negative effect on mortality was considered highly unlikely.  
Indeed, even if the difference in mortality as first endpoint event would not be fully explained by 
informative censoring, a detrimental effect of selexipag on mortality appears highly unlikely due the 
following considerations: a) selexipag exerted a beneficial effect on morbidity events in patients with 
PAH, which in turn were shown to be predictive for mortality events, b) selexipag is a prostacyclin 
analogue with the typical adverse event profile of this known class of PAH medications; prostacyclins 
are not suspected to be associated with an increased risk of mortality, c) the increase in heart rate 
after each dose is generally modest and transient and in the range of other vasodilatory drugs 
approved for PAH, d) There was no obvious explanation for the observed pattern that the imbalance 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report 
Page 106/117 
 
 
was limited to patients with FC II and better cardiac functioning. These patients should be less 
vulnerable to adverse effects than patients in FC III (and IV) and deteriorated cardiac function and 
there was no other unfavourable pattern seen in FC II. In a cross study comparison, mortality rate on 
selexipag in FC II was within the expected range, whereas the rate in the placebo arm was lower than 
expected. E.g. patients with PAH included in the REVEAL Registry (Farber et al., Chest. 2015 Oct 
1;148(4):1043-54) had an estimated 5-year survival rate of 88.0%, 75.6%, 57.0%, and 27.2% in FC 
I, II, III, and IV, respectively, if they were diagnosed previously. For newly diagnosed patients, 5-year 
survival rates were 72.2%, 71.7%, 60.0%, and 43.8%, respectively. The about 11% 3-year mortality 
rate in FC II on selexipag in the GRIPHON study does not indicate an increased risk. The result on 
selexipag fits better to these published survival rates than the < 4% 3-year mortality rate observed in 
the placebo arm.  
Taken together, the CHMP concluded that the observed increase in all cause mortality in the first event 
analysis was most likely an artefact due to informative censoring and/or a chance finding. 
Selexipag was generally well tolerated and exhibited the typical AE profile known for the class of 
prostacyclin (analogues). 
The transient and, on average, mild increase in heart rate after each administered dose of selexipag 
is of similar magnitude as reported for other vasodilatory PAH medication. However, in some patients 
the increase may be more pronounced and harmful, e.g. in patients at high risk for cardiovascular 
events.  
There was an imbalance in events of acute renal failure in the GRIPHON study (double-blind period), 
disfavouring selexipag. Not all of these events were considered serious because they reflected a 
transient decrease in renal function in patients with known chronic kidney disease. The number of 
cases was small (14 vs. 7) so that a chance finding cannot be excluded. There is no clear mechanistic 
link although prostacyclin (and thereby selexipag) may theoretically affect renal function, e.g. by 
affecting renal perfusion. However, since the number of events was small and the imbalance of serious 
events was less pronounced (10 vs. 7) the impact of this observation on B/R is considered low. 
Hypotension was more frequent with selexipag, which can be explained by a systemic vasodilatory 
effect of selexipag via the IP receptor. This finding is also in accordance with the observation of slightly 
increased heart rate after each administration. The incidence of serious hypotension was low and was 
balanced between the selexipag and the placebo group so that the impact on Benefit/Risk is considered 
minimal. Mentioning in the SmPC is considered sufficient. A more pronounced imbalance (selexipag vs. 
placebo) in hypotension was observed in patients receiving concomitant ERA and PDE5i. This is 
mechanistically a plausible explanation however the number of patients and events in this subgroup 
was too low for definite conclusions.  
Benefit-risk balance 
The B/R balance for selexipag in the proposed second-line indication is considered favourable. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Selexipag clearly reduced morbidity events in patients with PAH, which is a clinically relevant benefit.  
The beneficial effect on the 6-MWT in treatment naïve patients was within the range of other approved 
medicinal products and is considered clinically meaningful. It is also expected to observe a less 
pronounced effect in pretreated patients as observed with other treatments in PAH.  Overall, the 
efficacy of selexipag appears to be moderate mainly related to the high number (80%) of pretreated 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report 
Page 107/117 
 
 
patients in the study and may potentially be lower than that of approved non-prostacyclin PAH 
medications, which are usually considered as first-line treatments in PAH. 
Selexipag is the first orally available prostacyclin (IP) receptor agonist with proven long-term efficacy, 
compared to the currently approved prostacyclin analogues that have to be administered parenterally 
or by inhalation and are associated with risks such as embolism and thrombosis (continuous i.v. 
administration), local reactions (s.c. administration) or are time consuming (frequent inhalation).   
Considering all analyses and arguments, the CHMP concluded that the finding of increased mortality in 
the primary morbidity and mortality endpoint analysis is an artefact, which could be due to the study 
design and explained by informative censoring and/or a chance finding.  
Furthermore, no specific/unique safety issue could be identified that could explain the observed 
increase in mortality in patients with FC II as opposed to more severe patients in FC III and FC IV, 
thus  providing additional reassurance that the observed increase in mortality is likely not attributable 
to selexipag. 
In view of the efficacy demonstrated together with an acceptable safety profile, the CHMP concluded 
by majority on a positive benefit-risk balance. Selexipag is considered to provide a valuable orally 
available treatment alternative for patients with PAH. Based on these considerations and since 
selexipag was primarily assessed as an add-on treatment in the GRIPHON study, a second line 
indication is considered appropriate as follows :  
Uptravi is indicated for the long term treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in adult 
patients with WHO functional class (FC) II–III, either as combination therapy in patients insufficiently 
controlled with an endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) and/or a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) 
inhibitor, or as monotherapy in patients who are not candidates for these therapies. 
Efficacy has been shown in a PAH population including idiopathic and heritable PAH, PAH associated 
with connective tissue disorders, and PAH associated with corrected simple congenital heart disease 
(see section 5.1). 
Although there is no strong evidence from the trial data that the vasodilatory and heart rate effects of 
selexipag are harmful for patients with a high risk of CV events, contraindications for approved 
prostacyclin analogues (specifically iloprost) have been included in the product information of selexipag 
as a precautionary measure.

4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that selexipag is not similar Volibris, Opsumit and Adempas 
within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.  
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by majority 
decision that the risk-benefit balance of Uptravi for the following indication: "long term treatment of 
pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in adult patients with WHO functional class (FC) II–III, either 
as combination therapy in patients insufficiently controlled with an endothelin receptor antagonist 
(ERA) and/or a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitor, or as monotherapy in patients who are 
not candidates for these therapies. 
Efficacy has been shown in a PAH population including idiopathic and heritable PAH, PAH associated 
with connective tissue disorders, and PAH associated with corrected simple congenital heart disease 
(see section 5.1)" 
is favourable and therefore recommends  the granting of the  marketing authorisation subject to the 
following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Conditions and requirements of the Marketing Authorisation  
• 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
• 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the  
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report 
Page 112/117 
 
  
  
 
 
• 
Prior to launch of UPTRAVI in each Member State the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) must 
Additional risk minimisation measures  
agree about the content and format of the Controlled Access System with the National Competent 
Authority.  
The Controlled Access System is aimed to facilitate the identification of prescribers, to approach them 
with the appropriate information on the safe and effective use of UPTRAVI, and to provide them with 
risk minimisation tools, especially regarding the potential risk of medication error. The Controlled 
Access System should include three key principles that will be incorporated within each system in all 
Member States. These are:  
•  The identification and maintenance of a list of all UPTRAVI prescribers  
•  The distribution of kits to all identified prescribers to minimise the risks of medication error in 
particular 
•  Tracking of the receipt of the kits by prescribers 
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where UPTRAVI is marketed, all healthcare 
professionals who are expected to prescribe and/or dispense UPTRAVI are provided with a Prescriber 
Kit containing the following: 
•  The Summary of Product Characteristics for UPTRAVI  
•  Cover letter to the HCP  
•  HCP A4 laminated titration guide 
•  Patient titration guide 
The cover letter to the HCP should explain that the purpose of the educational materials is to reduce 
the risk of medication error due to the availability of multiple tablets and dose strengths, and it should 
provide a list of the content of the prescriber kit. 
The HCP A4 laminated titration guide is intended to reduce the risk of medication error due to the 
titration phase at treatment initiation with UPTRAVI and it should contain the following key elements: 
• 
• 
the dosing and titration concept 
the move to the maintenance dose (titration phase) 
•  expectations and management of adverse events during the titration phase 
•  encouragement and guidance for HCP to communicate clearly with the patient during their first 
visit, as well as to take responsibility to contact the patient during the titration phase, 
facilitating communication between HCP and the patient (need for contact and to schedule 
telephone calls) 
The Patient titration guide to be used by the HCP during discussions with the patient should contain the 
following key elements: 
• 
lay language version of the HCP A4 laminated titration guide 
•  diary to facilitate UPTRAVI use and serve as a reminder for the patients (e.g., to contact 
her/his doctor), and a place to record intake of tablets 
• 
information about the safe and effective use of UPTRAVI in lay language 
Uptravi (Selexipag) Assessment Report 
Page 113/117 
 
  
  
 
 
The patient titration guide along with the Patient Information Leaflet should be given to the patient 
after the demonstration. 
• 
Obligation to complete post-authorisation measures 
Not applicable 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
to be implemented by the Member States.

New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of data on the quality properties of the active substance, the CHMP 
considers that selexipag is qualified as a new active substance. 
Divergent position(s) to the majority recommendation are appended to this report.

The undersigned members of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion recommending 
the granting of the marketing authorisation of Uptravi indicated for the long term treatment of 
pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in adult patients with WHO functional class (FC) II–III, either as 
combination therapy in patients insufficiently controlled with an endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) 
and/or a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitor, or as monotherapy in patients who are not 
candidates for these therapies. 
Efficacy has been shown in a PAH population including idiopathic and heritable PAH, PAH associated 
with connective tissue disorders, and PAH associated with corrected simple congenital heart disease 
(see section 5.1). 
The overall benefit-risk balance for Uptravi in the claimed indication is considered negative due to: 
•  A  detrimental  effect  on  mortality  and  major  adverse  cardiac  events  (MACE)  and  transient 
ischemic attack (TIA) in the long-term cannot be ruled out.  
•  An  increase  in  all-cause  death  with  selexipag  cannot  be  excluded  (selexipag  46  events  vs. 
placebo  37  events;  HR:  1.17;  95%CI:  0.66  to  2.07)  and  an  increase  in  CV  death  cannot  be 
excluded  (selexipag  38  events  vs.  placebo  29  events;  HR:  1.24;  95%CI:  0.77  to  2.02)  [Full 
analysis  set  (FAS)  up  to  End  of  Treatment  plus  seven  days  (EoT+7d).  An  increase  in  CV 
mortality  in  the  patients  with  a  better  prognostic  at  baseline  (FCII,  preserved  cardiac  index) 
cannot  be  excluded  (selexipag  15  events  vs.  placebo  6  events;  HR:  2.24;  95%CI:  0.87  to 
5.77)  (FAS,  EoT+7d).  In  addition,  there  were  7  cases  of  blindly  adjudicated  sudden  cardiac 
death  (6  selexipag  vs.  1  placebo)  not  related  to  PAH,  in  which  a  causal  relationship  with 
selexipag  cannot  be  ruled  out  (FAS,  EOT+7d).  Statistical  artifacts,  like  informative  censoring 
cannot fully explain the imbalances observed in mortality. 
• 
• 
The same trend was noticed for the combination of fatal and non fatal MACE+TIA, for which an 
increase be excluded (selexipag 43 events vs. placebo 33 events; HR: 1.24; 95%CI: 0.79 to 
1.96) (FAS, EoT+7d).  
In the context of a disease with several specific medications available of different 
pharmacological classes, including other prostacyclin agonists, the approval of a drug with such 
uncertainties in CV safety and mortality is not endorsed. 
Overall, for these reasons, I consider that the benefit/risk ratio is negative for Uptravi in the above 
claimed indication.

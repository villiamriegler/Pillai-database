2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a subtype of chronic prurigo and can also be referred to as nodular prurigo or 
chronic nodular prurigo, and is defined by pruriginous nodular skin lesions in symmetrically distributed 
areas of the trunk and extremities. Chronic prurigo is defined by the presence of chronic pruritus for at 
least 6 weeks and multiple localized or generalized pruriginous cutaneous lesions Clinically, PN is 
characterized by severe pruritus that leads to prolonged, repetitive, and often uncontrollable rubbing 
and scratching that culminates in hyperkeratotic nodules on the skin. 
Pruritus is the central manifestation in PN and the main driver of disease burden resulting in a 
significant quality of life impairment. In patients with PN, the itching is characteristically intense, 
causing people to scratch themselves and leading to the development of an itch–scratch cycle, which 
exacerbates the cellular damage in skin lesions and facilitates secondary infections. Patients with PN 
report chronic sleep loss due to constant itching, often experience constant burning, stinging, and pain 
at affected areas, and are often afflicted by chronic depression and anxiety. This constellation of 
symptoms results in a large impact on their quality of life. Psychiatric conditions are common in 
patients with chronic pruritus, with approximately 70% of chronic pruritus patients having a psychiatric 
comorbidity. In those patients with chronic pruritus and depression, the severity of depression 
correlates with the intensity of itch. 
A variety of comorbidities is associated with PN, including mental health disorders, obesity, 
endocrine/metabolic disorders, autoimmune/auto-inflammatory disorders, cardiovascular disorders, 
renal disorders, malignancy, and atopy have been identified through case series and epidemiologic 
studies with PN have a higher comorbidity burden compared to age- and gender-matched controls as 
well as patients with AD or psoriasis, and higher healthcare utilization of specialty care services. Many 
of the associated comorbidities are characterized by pruritus and underlying neuronal and immune 
dysregulation, and likely contribute to the development of PN. 
Approximately 20-60% of PN patients have either past or current history of AD or other atopic 
disorders. Those patients with a history of atopic disorders exhibit cutaneous hypersensitivity to 
various environmental allergens. In contrast, PN patients with no history of atopy do not show 
hypersensitive reactions against these allergens. Patients with a history of atopy also demonstrate high 
total IgE levels in serum and the presence of eosinophils in the dermis of skin biopsies. 
The MAH’s initially claimed therapeutic indication was: 
Dupixent is indicated for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe prurigo nodularis (PN) who 
are candidates for systemic therapy. 
Epidemiology 
Broad epidemiological data for PN are lacking. A recent European study in a German population found 
an overall incidence rate of PN of 0.1%. The prevalence in Poland has been estimated to be 6.52 cases 
per 100 000 individuals. Prurigo nodularis is predominantly observed in older patients (median age of 
Assessment report  
EMA/9410/2023  
Page 8/141 
 
 
 
 
>50 years), and rarely occurs in children. PN affects both genders, however there is a female 
predominance. Black patients are disproportionately affected with PN compared to Caucasian patients. 
While PN patients demonstrated higher all-cause mortality than control patients without PN, likely due 
to the high comorbidity burden seen in patients with PN, Black PN patients had the highest all-cause 
mortality compared to other races.  
Pathogenesis 
The pathophysiology of PN is dependent on, and driven by, the itch-scratch cycle irrespective of the 
initial underlying aetiology, and is characterized by synergistic neuronal- and immune-mediated 
mechanisms that lead to neuronal hypersensitization. Studies of the lesional skin of patients with PN 
revealed increased dermal nerve fiber density, increased expression of the neuropeptides and 
production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators from keratinocytes and cutaneous immune 
cells, such as T cells, mast cells, and eosinophils. Pro-inflammatory Th2 cytokines are involved in PN. 
IL-4 and IL-13 can directly activate pruriceptors and cause neuronal sensitization leading to chronic 
itch. Type 2 cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-31, are upregulated in the skin of patients with PN.  Binding 
of IL-4 and IL-31 to these neuronal receptors may perpetuate the chronic activation of neurons and 
neuronal hypersensitization. In addition, IL-4 and IL-13 are pro-fibrotic cytokines and may play key 
roles in the fibrosis in PN lesions and drive chemotaxis of mast cells and eosinophils to the skin. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
The diagnosis of PN is clinically determined and based on a history of chronic, severe pruritus, and the 
clinical finding of characteristic excoriated, hyperkeratotic, firm dome-shaped, smooth topped, or 
crusted nodules that are often symmetrically distributed. Core symptoms are the presence of multiple 
pruriginous lesions (localized or generalized), the presence of chronic pruritus (obligatory: itch ≥6 
weeks) and the history and/or sign of a prolonged scratching behaviour.  
Lesions may be grouped, can vary in number from one lesion to hundreds, and are present in areas 
that can be scratched or rubbed. The histologic features include prominent compact orthokeratosis, 
focal parakeratosis, hypergranulosis, irregular epidermal hyperplasia, thick collagen bundles arrayed 
perpendicularly to the overlying epidermis, and scattered fibroblasts in the papillary dermis. 
Management 
There are no approved systemic therapies available for the treatment of PN and approved treatment 
options for PN are limited to a few specific topical corticosteroids TCS of which some are authorised 
nationally in the EU. Identifying and treating an underlying cause, if present, is essential to minimize 
recurrent pruritus and to avoid any treatments which may be contraindicated. The current consensus 
guideline of International Forum for the Study of Itch (IFSI) recommends to follow a multimodal 
stepwise approach including general strategies to control pruritus, treatment of concomitant, 
potentially pruritogenic diseases and therapy of pruriginous lesions. 
Topical therapies, such as topical corticosteroids (TCS) and topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) are used 
as first-line therapy alone or in combination. Continuous use of emollients as supportive antipruritic 
care is recommended. Other topical therapies such as Vitamin D3 analogues, topical anesthetics, 
topical capsaicin are also used but data regarding efficacy are lacking. 
Assessment report  
EMA/9410/2023  
Page 9/141 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Additional therapies used to treat PN include intralesional injections of corticosteroids, cryotherapy, 
and phototherapy. UV phototherapy is a viable therapeutic option, in particular for elderly patients with 
multi-morbidities and multi-medications. Antihistamines are often used in PN treatment but evidence 
of an antipruritic effect is low.  
Other systemic treatment options for patients with severe PN and a non-satisfactory response to the 
initial first line of therapies are neuromodulatory agents such as gabapentinoids, NKR 1 antagonists, 
antidepressants, and µ-opioid receptor antagonists and systemic immunosuppressants such as oral 
corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and methotrexate.  
Prurigo nodularis is a chronic skin disease with a high disease burden due to the central manifestation 
of pruritus and hyperkeratotic nodules with a substantial impact on the quality of life. There are 
currently no approved systemic therapies. The currently available effective treatment options for PN 
are limited and do not always achieve satisfactory response in PN patients. The therapy of PN remains 
challenging and of prolonged course. Based on the currently available therapies, there is an important 
unmet need for treatment options for patients with PN that cannot be controlled with the current 
treatment options. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Dupilumab is a human monoclonal IgG4 antibody that inhibits IL-4 and IL-13 signaling by specifically 
binding to the IL 4Rα subunit shared by the IL-4 and IL-13 receptor complexes. Dupilumab inhibits IL 
4 signaling via the Type I receptor (IL4Rα/γc) and both IL-4 and IL-13 signaling through the Type II 
receptor (IL 4Rα/IL 13Rα1). Blocking IL-4Rα with dupilumab can reduce the absolute number of Th2 
cells and inhibits IL-4 and IL-13 cytokine-induced type 2 inflammatory responses, including the release 
of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, nitric oxide, and IgE.  
Dupilumab is currently approved for the following indications: atopic dermatitis (AD), asthma, chronic 
rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP). 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
A Scientific Advice, with implications for the present Application was received from the CHMP in 2020 
(EMEA/H/SA/2744/11/2020/II). 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The MAH states that the clinical studies presented in this dossier were conducted in accordance with 
the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and that are consistent with 
the International Council for Harmonisation guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and applicable 
regulatory requirements. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
No new quality data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP.

2.2.1.  Justification regarding existing Drug-Device Combination 
In 3.2.R Regional information justifications have been provided regarding the use of the existing 
Medical Device Part of the Drug-Device Combination (DDC) 300 mg PFS, PFS-S and PFP for the 
introduction of the Prurigo nodularis indication for the adult patient population. 
Change assessment towards MDR Article 117 (PFS, PFS-S, PFP) 
The MAH has determined that there are no changes to the design or intended purpose of the device 
(part), nor is there a new medical device being introduced. Therefore, a Notified Body opinion is not 
required. The details of the MAH´s assessment are as follows: 
• There is no impact on the medical device clinical use; as it will still be administered with the same 
procedure and at the same injection sites (abdomen, upper thigh regions and upper arm).  
• There are no changes to the medical device instructions for use related to the new therapeutic 
indication. 
• There is no change to the intended users; the self-administration patient characteristics (functional 
capabilities/impairment such as perceptual, cognitive, manual dexterity, other comorbidities) are equal 
to the currently approved population. 
Table 1 Intended users and patient populations of Dupilumab 300 mg PFS, PFS-S and PFP for the 
new therapeutic indication 
Usability Studies 
The MAH has determined that there is no need for additional Usability Studies. 
The quality, safety and/or efficacy of the DDC product are not affected as the assessment results 
conclude the following: 
• There are no changes to the medical device instructions for use related to the new therapeutic 
indication. 
• There are no changes to the performance requirements, nor the specifications of the medical device. 
• No new or different risks in relation to the medical device use have been identified, therefore no new 
mitigations need to be introduced. The existing Risk Management File will be updated as part of the life 
cycle management activities. The hazard list is already covering this new therapeutic indication. 
No need for additional Usability Studies; usability for the PFS, PFS-S and PFP is supported by human 
factors data that could be bridging data to the same identical device part used with the patient 
populations tested to support the approved indications. 
The intended user population is unchanged versus the DDC currently authorised, as the self-
administration patient characteristics (functional capabilities/impairment such as perceptual, cognitive, 
manual dexterity, other comorbidities) are equivalent to the currently approved populations. 
Therefore, the bridging data can demonstrate the effective use of the DDC by the same intended user 
population.

Page 11/141 
 
 
 
 
 
2.2.2.  Discussion on quality 
No new quality data have been submitted in this application. 
The proposed new Prurigo nodularis indication for adults does not result in the introduction of a new 
medical device or a modification to the design, or aforementioned intended use/purpose of the medical 
device part of the Drug Device Combination (DDC). Therefore, it is agreed that the variation 
application supporting the new therapeutic indication does not require a Notified Body Opinion (NBOp) 
for the currently authorised DDC.  
It is agreed that there is no need for additional Usability Studies as the new therapeutic indication has 
no impact on the 1) intended users, 2) the clinical use, and 3) use-related risks. In addition, there is 
no difference in the medical device instructions for use compared with the authorised instructions. 
From a quality point of view, the MAH´s justifications regarding the use of the existing Medical Device 
Part of the DDC 300 mg PFS, PFS-S and PFP for the new therapeutic indication in adults is accepted. 
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the quality aspects 
The available quality data do not raise concern in the indication. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.3.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The environmental risk assessment provided in Module 1.6 has been updated. 
A claim of exclusion from submission of environmental risk assessment studies is made according to 
Section 2 of the 2006 CHMP Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for 
Human Use (ERA Guideline corr 2) because dupilumab is a monoclonal antibody consisting of linked 
naturally occurring amino acids. Per the ERA Guideline, vitamins, electrolytes, amino acids, peptides, 
proteins, carbohydrates and lipids are exempt from ERA study requirements because by their nature 
they are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. 
2.3.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application. 
The claim for ERA exemption by the MAH is justified and in conformity with the ERA guideline since the 
extension indication variation request concerns a monoclonal antibody consisting of naturally occurring 
amino acids. Dupilumab is significantly metabolized in-vivo and is expected to be readily and rapidly 
degraded in wastewater treatment systems and in the environment. The antibody’s structure and 
mode of action do not indicate any specific risk to the environment. 
2.3.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The available non-clinical data do not raise concern in the indication. 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental

exposure further to the use of dupilumab.  
- Considering the above data, dupilumab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Dupilumab concentrations in serum were measured in studies EFC16459 and EFC16460 using sparse 
sampling (samples collected at predose, during treatment at Week 4, Week 8, Week 12 and Week 24, 
and at the end of the follow-up period at Week 36). Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the 
concentration data over time in patients with PN in the individual studies.

The PK of dupilumab in healthy subjects and in patients with AD, asthma, and CRSwNP is also 
extensively described in the original marketing application for AD and the subsequent applications for 
asthma and CRSwNP. 
Dupilumab concentrations determined in the PN population were compared to the dupilumab 
concentrations in AD, asthma, and CRSwNP populations as well as in healthy subjects using both 
descriptive analysis from the observed data and a model-based approach.  
A Pop PK analysis was conducted, using the MAP Bayesian approach (Study POH0779), based on a 
previously established global Pop PK base model from the CRSwNP submission (see Section 2.4.4). 
This global Pop PK structural model was developed using dupilumab data pooled from Phase 1 to Phase 
3 studies in healthy subjects (adults), patients with AD (adults), and asthma (adults and adolescents). 
Data from Studies EFC16459 and EFC16460 were not included in the global Pop PK model 
development, but were evaluated using the MAP Bayesian approach, which allows the incorporation of 
prior information into the analysis for the PK data in patients with PN. The adequacy of the Bayesian 
approach based on the global model to describe the PK data in patients with PN was first confirmed by 
standard diagnostic criteria (external validation). The post hoc exposure estimates from the model 
were then used to assess the effect of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on dupilumab PK in the PN 
population. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters in patients with PN 
The observed Ctrough and Pop PK model-based post hoc estimates of dupilumab exposure at steady 
state (Cmax, Ctrough, and AUC) are shown below. Dupilumab steady-state exposure at 300 mg Q2W was 
similar for the two studies. The Pop PK model estimates were consistent with the observed values for 
Ctrough, demonstrating a robust model performance in describing dupilumab PK in the PN-patient 
population.

Absorption, Distribution and Elimination 
The disposition of dupilumab in patients with PN was similar with that reported for the AD, asthma, 
and CRSwNP populations based on Pop PK analysis. It is well-absorbed, distributes primarily within the 
vascular compartment, and exhibits saturable target-mediated elimination. After the last dose of a 300 
mg Q2W SC regimen, the model-predicted median time for dupilumab concentration to decline from PK 
steady state to below LLOQ (0.078 mg/L) in a typical adult patient with PN is 12 weeks. Steady state 
was achieved by Week 12 for the 300 mg Q2W regimen. The mean steady-state trough concentrations 
at Week 12 and Week 24 (end of treatment) were 59.8-65.3 mg/L and 60.2 68.6 mg/L, respectively. 
Comparison between adult PN population and other adult disease populations  
As shown in the figure below, the observed concentration-time profiles in adult patients with PN are 
similar across the 2 PN studies and similar to those observed in adult patients with AD, asthma, and 
CRSwNP, except for lower concentrations over the first few weeks in patients with CRSwNP due to the 
absence of a loading dose in this population. The observed dupilumab steady-state exposure (Ctrough) 
at 300 mg Q2W was similar across PN, AD, asthma, and CRSwNP patient populations with various 
dupilumab-treatment durations. In patients with PN, steady state was achieved by Week 12 for the 
300 mg Q2W regimen.  
Based on the PN Pop PK model, the median time to steady-state was 10 weeks for 300 mg Q2W with a 
loading dose in a typical individual, which is similar to AD and asthma studies (figure below). The 
model-based predictions, which are not dependent on study design, represent a more robust 
assessment of the time to steady state than those derived from observed data, which are in part 
dependent on the PK sampling scheme.

The similarity in the PK of dupilumab between PN, AD, asthma, and CRSwNP populations was 
investigated using Pop PK analysis where a previously developed global base model using data from 
healthy subjects and patients with AD and asthma (study POH0668) was used to describe the PK in 
patients with PN (see figure below). Based on the PN Pop PK model, the median time to steady-state 
was 10 weeks for 300 mg Q2W with a loading dose in a typical individual, which is similar to AD and 
asthma studies. Besides body weight that was already included in the base model, no other covariates 
were identified as sources of PK variability in patients with PN (study POH0779). 
Figure 2. Comparison of dupilumab typical concentration-time profiles at 300 mg Q2W in adult 
patients with PN, AD, asthma, and CRSwNP as predicted by population pharmacokinetic models 
Note: The typical profile simulation was conducted at 300 mg Q2W with a 600 mg loading dose (in AD, asthma, and PN) and without a loading 
dose (in CRSwNP) using Pop PK models for AD (REGN668-MX-16103-CP-01V1), asthma (POH0530), CRSwNP (POH0611), and PN 
(POH0779) for a typical (adult) Caucasian patient with median values of the covariates for the respective populations as follows: weight of 75 kg 
for AD and asthma (79 kg for CRSwNP and 73 kg for PN), albumin of 45 g/L, body mass index of 25.1 kg/m2, creatinine clearance normalized to 
body surface area of 111 mL/min/1.73 m2, and eczema area severity index of 29.5 (AD only) and negative ADAs.

Sources of pharmacokinetic variability 
The mean and SD of steady-state exposures (i.e., AUCτ,ss, Cmax,ss, and Ctrough,ss) of dupilumab in 
patients with PN after 300 mg Q2W in studies EFC16460 and EFC16459 as a function of selected 
intrinsic/extrinsic factors are provided in the table below. Boxplots of dupilumab predicted steady-state 
exposures in patients with PN as a function of intrinsic/extrinsic factors are provided below. 
Among the evaluated factors, only body weight exerted a noticeable effect explaining variability source 
in dupilumab PK in patients with PN. Patients in lower body weight group exhibited higher exposures of 
dupilumab.

All other tested factors, including baseline demographics (gender, age, and race), baseline lab 
parameters (creatinine clearance and albumin), immunogenicity, ethnicity, and baseline biomarker and 
disease characteristics (IgE, IGA score, WINRS, duration of PN) had no apparent effect on dupilumab 
PK exposure based on available data. Some apparent difference in PK exposure across ADA, race and 
albumin categories were inclusive, which may be due to limited data (<10% patients in certain 
categories). The impact of comorbidity (atopic comorbidities) and concomitant medication (use of TCS 
/ TCI) on dupilumab PK exposure was found to be minimal based on available data.

Body weight  
Body weight is the primary factor explaining between-subject variability of dupilumab PK in patients 
with PN, consistent with previous findings in different disease/age populations. The linear elimination 
rate constant (Ke), volume of the central compartment (V2), and maximum target-mediated rate of 
elimination (Vmax) decreased (and hence exposure increased) with decrease in body weight in 
patients with PN (Study POH0779).

Table 6. Mean (SD)[CV%] observed steady-state exposures of dupilumab in patients with PN by 
weight category 
Age  
There were 40 of elderly patients (≥65 years, n=33; ≥75 years, n=7); representing 23.1% and 4.9% 
of total patients in the Pop PK dataset. The respective Pop PK analyses of dupilumab concentration 
data obtained from the different age groups of adults showed comparable PK parameters of dupilumab. 
Due to the lack of age effect on PK in adults and as there are no clinically significant differences in 
efficacy and safety across age subgroups, no dose adjustment for age is recommended in patients with 
PN. 
Gender 
There are no differences in the dupilumab concentrations between female and male patients with PN in 
Studies EFC16459 and EFC16460. The post hoc assessment (Study POH0779) of data from 96 (67.1%) 
female and 47 (32.9%) male subjects showed that gender had no impact on dupilumab PK, similar to 
previous findings in patients with AD, asthma, and CRSwNP. Due to the lack of an effect of gender on 
PK and, as there are no clinically significant differences in efficacy and safety across gender subgroups, 
no dose adjustment is recommended for gender. 
Race/ethnicity 
The post hoc assessment (Study POH0779) of the data from patients with PN in Studies EFC16459 and 
EFC16460 consisting of Caucasian (N=81, 56.6%), Asian (N=46, 32.2%), Black (N=11, 7.7%), and 
other races (N=5, 3.5%) showed that race had no impact on dupilumab PK, consistent with the 
previous findings in patients with AD, asthma, and CRSwNP.  
The higher mean exposure (observed Ctrough and post hoc estimate of steady-state exposure) in Asians 
versus non-Asians is mainly the result of differences in body weight (median weight of 67.1 kg in 
Asians versus 78.8 kg in non-Asians).  
The lower mean exposure in Black population versus other races is mainly the result of differences in 
body weight (median weight of 94.3 kg in Blacks versus 67.1-76.8 kg in other races). 
Similarly, when data from a subset of the Japanese population (patients from Japan) are considered, 
the higher mean exposure in this subset of Japanese patients versus the rest of the population (non-
Japanese) is mainly the result of differences in body weight (median weight of 60.0 kg in Japanese 
versus 75.8 kg in non-Japanese). 
As the small differences in PK by race/ethnicity are explained by body weight differences and as there 
are no clinically significant differences in efficacy and safety across race groups or ethnic groups, no 
dose adjustment is recommended for race or ethnicity. 
Other laboratory parameters  
The comparison of Pop PK model predicted post hoc estimates (Study POH0779) showed that albumin 
had no impact on dupilumab PK in patients with PN, similar to previous findings in patients with AD, 
asthma, and CRSwNP.

Baseline biomarkers and disease markers  
Based on the comparison of Pop PK model-predicted post hoc estimates (Study POH0779), baseline 
IgE and baseline disease characteristics (baseline WI-NRS score and baseline IGA score) did not 
significantly affect the PK of dupilumab in patients with PN. 
Disease populations  
The comparison of Pop PK model predicted post hoc estimates (Study POH0779) showed that history 
of atopy (ie, atopic or non-atopic) had no impact on dupilumab PK in patients with PN. 
The observed dupilumab steady state Ctrough in patients with PN are similar to those with AD, asthma 
and CRSwNP and also shown by Pop PK analysis via MAP Bayesian approach, which is consistent with 
the previously reported similarity of PK in patients across the disease populations. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Blocking of the IL 4Rα receptor subunit with dupilumab inhibits IL 4 and IL 13 (type 2) cytokine-
induced responses, including the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and IgE through 
this pathway. Total IgE, as a biomarker of type 2 inflammation, was assessed in serum in study 
EFC16460 and EFC16459 to further characterize the mode of action of dupilumab. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Total IgE in serum 
Total IgE in serum at baseline were generally similar in both studies, with higher numerical median 
values in the dupilumab group compared to the placebo group but with considerable overlap in ranges. 
In the pooled ITT population, median baseline total IgE levels in serum were elevated compared to the 
normal reference range (0-119 IU/mL) with the median value of 261.0 IU/mL (Q1-Q3 ranges: 64.1-
1050.0 IU/mL) and 146.0 IU/mL (Q1 Q3 ranges: 36.3-971.5 IU/mL) in the dupilumab and placebo 
groups, respectively. Median values of baseline total IgE levels in serum were numerically higher in 
participants with comorbid atopic history compared to those without with considerable overlap in 
ranges.

Table 8. Summary of biomarker data at baseline by history of atopy - Pooled ITT population 
Concentrations of total IgE in serum showed a continuous decline throughout the dupilumab-treatment 
period, in contrast to participants receiving placebo with no apparent difference observed between 
Studies EFC16459 and EFC16460. The median percent reduction from baseline in total IgE 
concentrations with dupilumab treatment was -60.86% at Week 24. Total serum IgE percent change 
over time was similar in participants with and without history of atopy. The decline in total IgE, a 
marker specific for type 2 immunity, is consistent with effective IL-4 and IL-13 signaling blockade. The 
IgE profiles showed a similar median magnitude of effect over time in PN, AD, asthma, and CRSwNP 
patient populations.

Immunogenicity Data 
The incidence of treatment-emergent ADAs was 7.7% (11 participants) in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W 
group compared to 2.0% (3 participants) in the placebo group. Persistent ADA responses were 
observed in 1.4% of participants receiving dupilumab 300 mg Q2W compared to 0% for placebo. Most 
of these treatment-emergent ADA responses were low titer. High titer ADA response (>10 000) was 
not observed. A total of 2.8% of participants receiving dupilumab 300 mg Q2W were classified as NAb-
positive compared to 1.4% of participants in the placebo group.

Comparing the immunogenicity of dupilumab across different populations, the ADA incidence was 
generally similar across the AD, asthma, CRSwNP, and PN populations with respect to treatment-
emergent positive ADA response (5.1-7.7%), persistent ADA response (1.4-2.1%), and NAb response 
(1.0-3.4%) after 24 or 52 weeks of treatment with dupilumab 300 mg Q2W with or without a loading 
dose. 
The association between the treatment-emergent ADA response and the clinical response was 
investigated in participants using the measures of improvement (reduction) in WI NRS by ≥4 points 
from baseline to Week 12 and Week 24, the percentage of participants with IGA PN S 0 (“clear”) or 1 
(“almost clear”) score at Week 24, and the percentage of participants with both an improvement 
(reduction) in WI NRS by ≥4 points from baseline to Week 24 and IGA PN S 0 or 1 score at Week 24. 
Overall, the efficacy of dupilumab was within the range observed for ADA negative participants for 
efficacy endpoints used in study EFC16460 and EFC 16459.

Study POH0779 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis of dupilumab using pooled data from 2 Phase 3 studies in patients 
with prurigo nodularis 
Objective and methods: The main objectives of this study were to characterize the PK of dupilumab in 
patients with PN based on a previously developed Pop PK model for dupilumab (i.e., external 
validation) and to assess the influence of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on dupilumab PK in patients 
with PN via post hoc assessment. 
Data from Studies EFC16459 and EFC16460 in patients with PN were pooled for this analysis. At the PK 
data cut-off dates of 27 October 2021 for Study EFC16459 and of 11 August 2021 for Study EFC16460 
(prior to clinical database lock), PK data up to Week 24 were available for 87% of participants in Study 
EFC16459 (N=65 [87%]) and Study EFC16460 (N=67 [87%]). Also included in the dataset were PK 
data at Week 36 (after 12 weeks off-treatment) from 48 (64%) and 34 (44%) participants from Study 
EFC16459 and Study EFC16460, respectively. The final dataset included 143 patients with PN with a 
total of 568 dupilumab concentrations.  
The global base model previously developed using dupilumab data pooled from Phase 1 to Phase 3 
studies in healthy subjects (adults), patients with AD (adults) and patients with asthma (adults and 
adolescents) in Study POH0668 (in the CRSwNP submission) was used in the analysis. Taking into 
account the similarity in the observed dupilumab PK profiles across different populations, the 
previously developed global Pop PK base model (study POH0668) based on pooled data from HV, 
patients with AD and asthma was utilized in the Pop PK analysis in patients with PN. As shown in the 
figure below, the global Pop PK base model was a two-compartment model with a first order 
absorption, and parallel linear and nonlinear elimination. 
Figure 7. Schematic structure of dupilumab global PK base model 
Data from Studies EFC16459 and EFC16460 were not included in the global Pop PK model development 
but were evaluated through a MAP Bayesian approach in which all Pop PK model parameters were fixed 
to the values of the global PK model and individual concentrations were generated by MAP probability 
Bayesian estimation for patients with PN.  
Results: The PK of dupilumab in patients with PN was adequately described by the global Pop PK base 
model, which is a 2 compartment model with parallel linear and nonlinear elimination, with body 
weight included as a covariate in the base model. Results of the external visual predictive check of 
observed dupilumab concentrations in Studies EFC16459 and EFC16460 and concentrations predicted 
by the global Pop PK base model are presented below. The visual predictive check, along with 
diagnostic plots and quality criteria, confirmed dupilumab PK similarity across the disease populations 
and justified the application of the previously developed model for covariate assessment.

Study CTS0084 
Empirical exposure-response analysis of WI-NRS and IGA PN-S for dupilumab prurigo nodularis 
Phase 3 studies 
Objectives and methods: The objectives of the empirical PK/PD analyses in this study were to 
understand dupilumab E-R relationships in patients with PN with regard to the 2 key efficacy 
endpoints, and to identify covariates influencing E-R relationships. Efficacy endpoints assessed were 
improvement (reduction) in WI-NRS by ≥4 points from baseline at Week 24 and achievement of IGA 
PN-S score of 0 or 1 at Week 24. Observed Ctrough at Week 24 was used as the dupilumab exposure 
parameter. The E-R relationships between the observed Week 24 Ctrough and the probability of patients 
achieving response at Week 24 for either WI-NRS or IGA PN-S was evaluated using the logistic 
regression. The analyses included pooled data from Studies EFC16459 and EFC16460. Three base 
models of the E-R relationship, linear, log linear, and maximum drug-induced effect (Emax), with 
appropriate covariates, were compared to select the best model by a goodness of fit criterion (the 
Akaike information criterion with sample size correction). 
Any missing observed Ctrough at Week 24 was imputed using last observation carried forward from 
Week 12. The same approach of handling missing efficacy data in the primary and key secondary 
efficacy endpoint analyses was applied in the E-R relationship analyses assessments for WI-NRS and 
IGA PN-S. Participants taking prohibited medications/procedures and/or rescue medications prior to 
Week 24 or having missing data at Week 24 are considered non responders. 
In addition, the E-R relationship for an improvement (reduction) in WI-NRS by ≥4 points from baseline 
at Week 12, IGA PN-S score of 0 or 1 at Week 12, and the multicomponent endpoint was explored 
using univariate descriptive analyses. 
Results: The relationship between WI-NRS response (≥4 points from baseline at Week 24) and 
functional dupilumab Ctrough at Week 24 was best described by a log linear model. Age is a significant 
covariate for the treatment response. Older patients were predicted to have modestly higher response.

The relationship between IGA PN S response (IGA PN-S score of 0 or 1 at Week 24) and functional 
dupilumab Ctrough at Week 24 was best described by a log linear model. The use of TCS/TCI and 
baseline IGA PN-S score are significant covariates for the treatment response. Patients using TCS/TCI 
as well as patients with higher baseline IGA PN S scores were predicted to have higher response (the 
odds ratio of dupilumab versus placebo) to dupilumab treatment. The differences were contributed by 
a lower placebo responder rate in those participants who used TCS/TCI or those participants who had 
higher IGA PN S scores. The results of descriptive quartile analysis for the multicomponent endpoint at 
Week 24 were consistent to WI-NRS response and IGA PN-S response at Week 24, showing a generally 
flat E-R relationship.

Descriptive quartile analysis for WI-NRS at Week 24  
The proportion of patients with WI NRS response (≥4 points improvement from baseline) by observed 
Ctrough quartiles at Week 24 from Studies EFC16459 and EFC16460 were calculated and show no 
clear relationship within the range of dupilumab concentrations in the study. The baseline values of 
WI-NRS, baseline values of IGA PN-S, and history of atopy (%) were in general balanced in each 
exposure quartile, while the distributions of TCS/TCI use, and baseline antidepressant use showed 
numerical differences by exposure quartile. The unbalanced distributions of baseline values in each 
exposure quartile likely contributed to the difference observed in each quartile as the potential

influence of confounding factors. Additionally, the distributions of baseline value of body weight 
showed higher body weight in the patients in the lowest exposure quartile, which is expected since 
body weight is the main source of PK variability. 
Empirical model for WI-NRS  
Model-based analysis showed a greater increase of WI-NRS response with increasing dupilumab Ctrough 
at Week 24 from the first to second quartile (Q1 - Q2) and thereafter a shallow increase that appeared 
to plateau. Older patients were predicted to have modestly greater treatment response. Body weight, 
race, and history of atopy were not found to be significant covariates for the treatment response.

Descriptive quartile analysis for IGA PN-S at Week 24  
The IGA PN-S response is summarized by observed Ctrough quartiles in the table below. The results 
appeared to show a generally flat relationship within the range of dupilumab concentrations in the 
study. The baseline values of IGA PN-S, baseline values of WI-NRS, and history of atopy (%) were in 
general balanced in each exposure quartile, while the distributions of TCS/TCI use and baseline 
antidepressant use showed numerical differences by exposure quartile. The baseline values were 
potentially confounding factors as they were unbalanced across quartiles, thus contributing to the 
observed difference by quartile. The lowest exposure quartile had higher baseline body weight, which 
is expected since body weight is the main source of PK variability. 
Empirical model for IGA PN-S  
Model-based analysis showed a greater increase of IGA PN-S response increasing dupilumab Ctrough at 
Week 24 from the first to second quartile (Q1 - Q2) and thereafter a shallow increase that appeared to 
plateau. Patients using TCS/TCI and with higher baseline IGA PN-S were predicted to have higher 
response (the odds ratio of dupilumab versus placebo). A lower placebo responder rate in those 
participants who used TCS/TCI or those participants who had higher IGA PN-S, rather than a difference 
in dupilumab exposure, contributed to this difference in response. Body weight, race, and history of 
atopy were not found to be significant covariates for the treatment response.

2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The PK and PD profiles of dupilumab were evaluated in studies EFC16460 and EFC16459 including 
adult patients with PN whose disease was inadequately controlled on topical prescription therapies or 
when those therapies were not advisable. Efficacy and the main safety data for this application were 
also derived from these studies. In EFC16460 and EFC16459, dupilumab was administered for 24 
weeks with the same dose regimen (300mg, Q2W) as for the already approved indications: AD, 
asthma and CRSwNP. As for AD, an initial loading dose of 600mg (2 injection with 300mg) was used. 
Considering the pathophysiological similarities between PN and AD and the already demonstrated itch 
reduction in the AD studies, this approach is reasonable. Bioanalytical methods for the PK and PD 
analysis include assays for quantitation of functional dupilumab, quantitative and functional assays for 
anti-drug antibodies, and an assay to determine total IgE concentrations. 
In studies EFC16460 and EFC16459, the mean Ctrough of functional dupilumab reached steady state by 
Week 12, and remained on this level until the end of the treatment period (Week 24). Steady-state 
exposures at 300mg, Q2W were overall similar between both individual studies. At Week 12 and Week 
24, the mean (SD) trough concentration of dupilumab was 65.3 (32.7) and 68.6 (36.7) mg/L in study 
EFC16460 and 59.8 (29.5) and 60.2 (34.7) mg/L in study EFC16459, respectively. After 
discontinuation dupilumab concentrations declined to 0.460 (1.10) and 1.94 (6.12) within the 12-Week 
follow-up period. Similar to adult patients with AD, asthma and CRSwNP, the distribution of dupilumab 
can be described as primarily within the vascular compartment with a non-linear target-mediated 
elimination.  
Comparing the observed dupilumab concentrations in PN across other indications, for which dupilumab 
is already approved, an overall similar PK profile is apparent. In particular, the mean observed steady 
state exposures of dupilumab are comparable to adult patients with AD or asthma were the same 
dosing regimen (including a loading dose) was used. The time profile of observed through 
concentrations appears also very similar as compared to the other approved adult indications.  
A previously developed dupilumab global Pop PK base model (study POH0668) which was also 
assessed in the CRSwNP application was used in the current Pop PK analysis for patients with PN 
(study POH0779). This global Pop PK base model is based on pooled data from 6 studies in healthy 
subjects, 10 studies in adult AD patients and 4 studies in asthma with adult and adolescent patients 
and was a two-compartment model with a first order absorption and parallel linear and nonlinear

elimination, with body weight as covariate. Data from Studies EFC16459 and EFC16460 were not 
included in the global Pop PK model development, but were evaluated using the MAP Bayesian 
approach. The predicted dupilumab typical concentration-time profile at 300 mg Q2W in adult patients 
with PN is very similar to the observed trough concentration-time profiles in studies EFC16460 and 
EFC1645 and also comparable to the other indications: AD, asthma and CRSwNP. 
As within the other indications, body weight was identified as the primary factor responsible for 
dupilumab PK variability which however does not significantly impair the efficacy of dupilumab. Overall, 
the PK variability of dupilumab is considered similar in PN, CRSwNP, asthma, and AD patient 
populations. No relevant effect on the dupilumab PK is apparent considering intrinsic factors analysed 
including age, gender, race/ethnicity, albumin, laboratory parameters and baseline disease markers 
and disease characteristics. No dose adjustment with respect to PK covariates is proposed by the MAH 
in the PN population which is endorsed by the CHMP. 
A base PK/PD model was used to evaluate the exposure/response form within linear, log-linear and 
Emax models. The fitted model with stable coefficient estimates and lowest goodness of fit criterion AICc 
was used. The AUC of the ROC curve was provided indicating an overall good fit of the model and 
predicted response rates for WI-NRS and PN-S were similar to the observed responses. Bar plots by 
the concentration quartiles, placebo and corresponding summary statistics were calculated for WI-NRS 
and IGA PN-S response rates at Week 24 (and also Week 12). Overall, no clear relationship within the 
range of dupilumab concentrations is apparent from the descriptive analysis of percentages of WI-NRS 
and PN-S responders by Ctrough quartiles at Week 24. 
In studies EFC16460 and EFC164569, the incidence of treatment emergent ADAs was 2.0% (n=2) and 
7.7% (n=11) for the placebo and dupilumab group, respectively, which is comparable to the incidences 
observed in the other indications AD, asthma and CRSwNP. No relevant impact of ADA-formation on 
efficacy and safety is apparent which is further described in Section 2.5 and Section 2.6. 
Total IgE in serum was used as a main PD biomarker in studies EFC16460 and EFC16459 to further 
characterize the mode of action of dupilumab. Treatment with dupilumab led to a pronounced 
reduction (median percent reduction from baseline:  60.86%) of total IgE at the end of the treatment 
period at Week 24 indicating inhibition of IL-4 and IL-13 signaling. The extent and the kinetics of total 
IgE-reduction are comparable to what has been already observed in the other indications AD, asthma 
and CRSwNP. Total serum IgE percent change over time was similar in participants with and without 
history of atopy. 
Overall, the PK profile of dupilumab 300mg Q2W in patients with PN appears to be similar to the 
observed PK profiles in adults with in the other indications AD, asthma, and CRSwNP.  
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Results of the PK/PD analyses are consistent with the efficacy evaluation in patients with PN. The PK 
profile of dupilumab is very similar to adult patients with AD, asthma and CRSwNP with regard to 
absorption, distribution and elimination, steady state exposures and pharmacokinetic variability. 
As within the other indications, body weight was identified as the primary factor responsible for 
dupilumab PK variability which however does not significantly impair the efficacy of dupilumab. No 
dose adjustment with respect to these PK covariates is proposed by the MAH in the PN population 
which is endorsed.  
Descriptive and model-based analysis showed no relevant relationship with individual dupilumab 
exposure ranges. The ADA response in PN patients is consistent with ADAs observed for AD, asthma

and CRSwNP patients. As within other indications, treatment with dupilumab led to a pronounced 
reduction of total IgE used as PD marker for IL-4/IL 13 signalling inhibition. 
In conclusion, the proposed dose regimen for dupilumab 300 mg Q2W with a loading dose of 600 mg 
in adults with PN is endorsed from a pharmacological point of view. The following dose 
recommendation for PN patients is therefore added in section 4.2 of the SmPC: The recommended 
dose of dupilumab for adult patients is an initial dose of 600 mg (two 300 mg injections), followed by 
300 mg given every other week.

2.5.2.  Main studies 
Study EFC16460 (LIBERTY-PN PRIME2) and EFC16459 (LIBERTY-PN 
PRIME): Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study to 
assess the efficacy and safety of a 24 week treatment period with 
Dupilumab 300mg Q2W in adult participants with moderate to severe PN 
with or without the use of topical prescription therapies 
Data for clinical efficacy is based on two replicate phase 3 studies EFC16459 (LIBERTY-PN PRIME) and 
EFC16460 (LIBERTY-PN PRIME2). Both studies are randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, 
parallel group studies to assess the efficacy and safety of a 24 week treatment period with dupilumab 
300 mg Q2W in adult participants with moderate to severe PN with or without the use of topical 
prescription therapies. Both studies were in general identical in design except for the timing of the 
primary endpoint in study EFC16459 that was moved from Week 12 to Week 24 during study conduct 
per protocol amendment. 
Methods 
Both studies had the same design consisting of the following 3 periods (see also Figure below): 
• Screening period (2 to 4 weeks) 
• Randomized study intervention period (24 weeks): 
• Follow-up period (12 weeks). 
Both studies were initiated with evaluation of the primary endpoint at Week 12. However, in study 
EFC16459 the timing for the primary endpoint in study was later moved from Week 12 to Week 24 per 
protocol amendment.

Primary Endpoint: EFC16460 (Week 12); EFC16459 (Week 24) 
Study participants 
For both studies, the key inclusion criteria were: 
▪  Aged 18 to 80 years, at the time of signing the informed consent 
▪  Diagnosed with PN by a dermatologist for at least 3 months before the Screening visit 
▪  An average score of ≥7 on the WI-NRS (range: 0 to 10) in the 7 days prior to Day 1 
▪  A minimum of 20 PN lesions in total on both legs, and/or both arms, and/or trunk, at Screening 
visit and on Day 1 
▪  History of failing a 2 week course of medium-to-superpotent TCS or when TCS were not medically 
advisable 
▪  Having applied a stable dose of topical emollient (moisturizer) once or twice daily for at least 5 out 
of 7 consecutive days immediately before Day 1 
For both studies, the key exclusion criteria were: 
▪ 
Presence of skin morbidities other than PN and mild AD that may interfere with the assessment of 
▪ 
▪ 
▪ 
the study outcomes 
PN secondary to medications 
PN secondary to medical conditions such as neuropathy or psychiatric disease  
Participants with a documented AD severity of moderate-to-severe within 6 months before the 
Screening visit, or documented diagnosis of moderate-to-severe AD from Screening visit to 
Randomization visit 
▪ 
Initiation of treatment with TCS/TCI (any potency) during the screening period or treatment with 
high potency or superpotent TCS/TCI during the screening period. 
Assessment report  
EMA/9410/2023  
Page 33/141 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
▪ 
For participants who were on a stable regimen of TCS/TCI (maintain same medicine, same dose 
from 2 weeks prior to screening visit) at the screening visit: 
▪  Application of TCS/TCI on fewer than 6 days during the 7 days immediately preceding 
randomization. 
▪  Application of TCS/TCI of incorrect potency within 7 days before Day 1 according to the 
requirements of Section 6.1.1, ie, low potency if on low potency at screening visit and medium 
potency if on medium or higher potency at screening visit. 
▪  Severe concomitant illness(es) under poor control that, in the Investigator’s judgement, would 
adversely affect the patient’s participation in the study 
▪  Active chronic or acute infection (except HIV infection) requiring treatment with systemic 
antibiotics, antivirals, antiprotozoals, or antifungals within 2 weeks before screening visit or during 
the screening period 
Treatment failure with medium-to-superpotent TCS was defined as patients who are unable to achieve 
and/or maintain remission and low disease activity despite treatment with a daily regimen of medium-
to-superpotent TCS (±TCI as appropriate), applied for at least 14 days, or for the maximum duration 
recommended by the product prescribing information, whichever is shorter. 
A cap was integrated such that no more than 60% of enrolled PN participants could have a history of 
atopy. Up to 10% of the enrolled atopic participants were allowed to have active mild AD while 
participants with moderate-to-severe AD were excluded to minimize confounding of the pruritus 
endpoints. Participants with systemic medical or psychological conditions were excluded unless these 
conditions were well controlled.  
Treatments 
The following study treatments were used: 
Dupilumab 
Dupilumab 300 mg Q2W after an initial loading dose of 600 mg (2 injections of 300 mg) on Day 1, 
administered subcutaneously. 
Placebo 
Matching placebo Q2W after an initial loading dose (2 injections of placebo) on Day 1. 
Background Medication 
Participants were required to apply moisturizers (emollients) once or twice daily for at least 5 out of 7 
consecutive days immediately before Day 1 and to continue throughout the study duration until Week 
36. Participants on a stable regimen of low to medium potency TCS or TCI at screening could continue 
their TCS or TCI application once daily without tapering from screening to Week 24. Stable regimen for 
TCS is maintaining the same medicine (low to medium potency TCS), and maintaining the same 
frequency of treatment (once or twice daily) used from 2 weeks prior to screening. Stable regimen for 
TCI is maintaining the same medicine of TCI and the treatment frequency (once or twice daily) used 
from 2 weeks prior to screening. If specific lesions resolved, the participant could stop applying 
steroids to those sites but was permitted to continue applying to persistent lesions. Participants on 
stable regimens of high potency or superpotent steroids at screening were to decrease potency to 
medium potency TCS and continue to apply daily from screening to Week 24. Occlusion was not 
allowed from Screening to Week 24.

Sample size 
The primary endpoint is the proportion of participants with WI-NRS reduction of ≥4 from baseline to 
Week 12. By assuming the response rate is 11% and 39% in placebo and dupilumab respectively, 56 
participants/arm will provide 90% power to detect the difference of 28% between dupilumab and 
placebo with Fisher exact test at 2-sided level of 0.05. Assuming 15% drop out during the 12 weeks of 
treatment, the target is to randomize 75 participants/arm with a cap of up to 10% of participants in 
the atopic population having active mild AD. Both the atopic and the non-atopic PN population will be 
capped at 60% of the total enrolled population. 
In study EFC 16459, the endpoint was changed (from week 12 to week 24) but the sample size 
calculation was not amended.

Randomisation 
Participants in studies EFC16460 and EFC16459 were planned to be randomized to dupilumab or 
placebo in 1:1 ratio with stratification factors of documented history of atopy (atopic or non-atopic), 
stable use of TCS/TCI (yes or no), and country/territory code. 
Blinding (masking) 
Dupilumab 300 mg and placebo matching dupilumab 300 mg is provided in identically matched 2 mL 
pre-filled syringes that are visually indistinguishable. Syringes and box will be labelled with a treatment 
kit number.

The following description of the methods is based on the study protocol: 
The efficacy population was planned to be the ITT population, defined as all randomized participants 
analyzed according to the treatment group allocated by randomization regardless if treatment kit is 
used or not. 
The primary outcome variable was planned to be the Proportion of participants with improvement 
(reduction) in WI-NRS by ≥4 from baseline to Week 12. 
The primary analysis was planned to be conducted by using CMH test stratifying by stratification 
factors (documented history of atopy [atopic or non-atopic], stable use of TCS/TCI [yes or no], and 
region [countries combined]) and covariate of baseline anti-depressant use (yes or no). 
For participants discontinuing the study treatment before Week 12, their off-study treatment values 
measured up to Week 12 were planned to be included in the analysis. 
Participants taking selected prohibited medications and/or rescue medications prior to Week 12 or 
having missing data at Week 12 were planned to be considered non-responders. 
In a sensitivity analysis, the data collected after taking selected prohibited medications and/or rescue 
medications was planned not to be censored and included to evaluate the robustness of the primary 
analysis results with respect to the method of handling data while taking selected prohibited 
medications. 
Subgroup analyses were prespecified for documented history of atopy (atopic or non-atopic), age 
group, gender, region. A subgroup analysis was planned to be performed excluding participants with a 
current diagnosis of AD. 
A study-level multiplicity procedure was planned to be used to control the overall type I error rate for 
testing the primary, key secondary, and selected other endpoints at a 2-sided significance level of 
0.05. The hierarchy was defined in the SAP only, and different hierarchies were defined for different 
regions. For EU and EU reference countries, the following hierarchy was defined in the SAP: 
1.  Proportion of participants with improvement (reduction) in WI-NRS by ≥4 from baseline to Week 
24 
2.  Proportion of participants with IGA PN-S 0 or 1 score at Week 24 
3.  Percent change from baseline in WI-NRS at Week 24

Results 
Participant flow 
EFC16460 (PRIME2) 
Out of the 221 participants screened for study eligibility, 61 (27.6%) were screen failures. The main 
reason for screen failure was not meeting inclusion criterion I03 (i.e., participants must have an 
average worst itch score of ≥7 in the 7 days prior to Day 1 [4.1% of all screened participants]). 
A total of 160 participants with PN were randomized to study intervention, 78 in the dupilumab group 
and 82 in the placebo group.  
132 (82.5%) participants completed the 24 week study intervention period, 27 (16.9%) permanently 
discontinued study intervention prior to Week 24. The most frequently reported reason for permanent 
study intervention discontinuation prior to Week 24 was lack of efficacy, either reported as the main 
reason by the Investigator or as the reason for withdrawal by the subject (2 [2.6%] participants in the 
dupilumab group and 14 [17.1%] in the placebo group). Of all participants who permanently 
discontinued study intervention due to lack of efficacy, 6 participants (1 in the dupilumab group and 5 
in the placebo group) started prohibited medications and permanently discontinued the study 
intervention.  
As of the cut-off date for study EFC16460 (30 August 2021), 76 (47.5%) participants had completed 
the study, while 55 (34.4%) participants were still ongoing in the study follow-up period and 29 
(18.1%) participants had discontinued from the study (of which 2 participants in the placebo group 
who discontinued the study due to an AE [PTs: HIV infection and neurodermatitis]).

reason for screen failure was not meeting inclusion criterion I03 (participants must have an average 
worst itch score of ≥7 in the 7 days prior to Day 1, [6.0%] of all screened participants). 
A total of 151 participants were randomized to study intervention: 75 in the dupilumab group and 76 
in the placebo group. There was 1 (1.3%) participant in the placebo group who was randomized but 
not exposed to study intervention due to participant’s decision (fear of being exposed to COVID-19). 
There were no participants who were exposed to study intervention but not randomized. 
133 (88.1%) participants completed the 24-week study intervention period as planned. The 
percentage of participants permanently discontinuing study intervention was lower in the dupilumab 
group compared to the placebo group (1 [1.3%] versus 16 [21.1%], respectively). Of all participants 
who permanently discontinued study intervention due to lack of efficacy, 4 participants in the placebo 
group started prohibited medications and had to permanently discontinue study intervention. 
As of the cut-off date for study EFC16459 (12 November 2021), 119 (78.8%) participants had 
completed the study, while 18 (11.9%) participants were ongoing in the study follow-up period and 14 
(9.3%) participants had discontinued from the study (of which 1 participant in the placebo group 
discontinued the study due to AE [PT: Inflammatory bowel disease]).

There was 1 amendment to the protocol of study EFC16460 and 3 amendments to the protocol of 
study EFC16459. Amendment 01 (20-May-2020) for study EFC 16460 and EFC 16459 included a new 
lesion-related key secondary endpoint (the proportion of participants with IGA PN-S at Week 24). 
Amendment 02 (14-Apr-2021) for study EFC16459 was not implemented in any country. Of note, 
within amendment 03 (21-Oct-2021) the timing for the primary endpoint of study EFC16459 was 
moved from Week 12 to Week 24 based on the efficacy data observed within study EFC16460.

Changes to the Planned Analyses 
Protocol deviations 
Critical or major protocol deviation occurred in 11 (14.1%) and 13 (17.3%) participants in the 
dupilumab group and in 22 (26.8%) and 17 (22.4%) participants in the placebo group within study 
EFC16460 and EFC16459, respectively. Most deviations were related to the informed consent 
procedures (EFC16460: 7; EFC16459: 7), inclusion/exclusion criteria (EFC16460: 11; EFC16459: 4), 
assessment procedures (EFC16460: 7; EFC16459: 10) and concomitant therapy (EFC16460: 8; 
EFC16459: 4).  
Baseline data 
Demographics 
EFC16460: 
The mean age of the randomized population was 48.8 years (range: 18 to 80 years). The proportion of 
participants aged 65 years or older was higher in the dupilumab group compared to the placebo group 
(24.4% versus 11.0%, respectively). 35.6% of participants were male and 64.4% were female, 60.0% 
were White, 32.5% Asian and 5.0% Black or African American. The median BMI was 26.04 kg/m2, 
with 38 (24.1%) participants having a BMI of ≥30 kg/m2. Out of the 4 regions included in the study 
(Western Countries, Asia, Latin America, and East Europe), the majority of enrolled participants were 
from Western Countries (57.5%) followed by Asia (26.9%), Latin America (8.8%), and East Europe 
(6.9%). 
EFC16459: 
The mean age of the randomized population was 50.1 years (range: 18 to 80 years). Approximately 
22% of participants were 65 years or older. Overall, 33.8% of participants were male and 66.2% were 
female, and 53.0% were White with 35.8% Asian and 7.3% Black or African American. The median 
BMI was 26.08 kg/m², with 42 (28.0%) participants having a BMI of ≥30 kg/m2. Enrolled participants 
were from Asia (33.1%), Latin America (27.2%), Western Countries (25.2%), and East Europe 
(14.6%). 
Baseline Disease Characteristics 
EFC16460: 
The mean age at onset of PN was 46.1 years in the dupilumab group and 41.7 years in the placebo 
group. Mean duration of PN was 5.42 years. The proportion of atopic participants was 43.6% in the 
dupilumab group, including 2.6% of participants with active mild AD, and 48.8% in the placebo group, 
including 6.1% of participants with active mild AD. Overall, 56.3% of participants were on a stable 
regimen of TCS/TCI at baseline. 
Mean (SD) WI-NRS score at baseline was 8.5 (1.0). Mean IGA PN-S score was 3.4 (0.5) with 61.6% 
and 38.4% of the participants having an IGA PN-S score of 3 (“moderate”) or 4 (“severe”), 
respectively. Mean (SD) IGA PN-A score at baseline was 3.4 (0.6) with 41.5% of all the participants 
having an IGA PN-A score of 4 (“severe”). The majority of participants (157 [98.1%]) classified their 
disease severity as “moderate” or “severe” at baseline, as measured by PGIS.  
EFC16459: 
The mean age at onset of PN was 45.0 years and the mean duration of PN was 5.70 years. The 
proportion of atopic participants was 44.0% in the dupilumab group (including 5.3% of participants 
with active mild AD) and 36.8% in the placebo group (including 2.6% of participants with active mild

AD), which was consistent with the prespecified cap in enrollment of atopic participants. Overall, 
60.9% of participants were on a stable regimen of TCS/TCI at baseline. 
Mean (SD) WI-NRS score at baseline was 8.5 (1.0) (scale range: 0 to 10, with 10 indicating worst 
imaginable itch) and a mean (SD) IGA PN-S score of 3.3 (0.5) (scale range: 0 to 4, with 4 indicating 
severe disease stage), with 28.7% of all randomized participants having an IGA PN-S score 4 
(“severe”). The overall mean (SD) IGA PN-A score at baseline was 3.3 (0.6) (scale range: 0 to 4, with 
4 indicating severe disease activity), with 39.3% of all randomized participants having at least an IGA 
PN-A score of 4 (“severe”).

Outcomes and estimation 
Study EFC16460 (PRIME2) 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
The proportion of participants with an improvement (reduction) in weekly average WI NRS by ≥4 
points from baseline to Week 12 was higher in the dupilumab group as compared to the placebo group 
(37.2% versus 22.0%; p=0.0216).

(EFC16460) 
Subgroup analyses by demographics and baseline disease characteristics are shown below. The 
treatment benefit of dupilumab versus placebo was still observed after excluding participants with 
active mild AD. There was a comparable dupilumab treatment benefit between atopic and non-atopic 
participants, and between participants with a baseline IGA PN-S score of 3 (“moderate”) and 4 
(“severe”). 
Most subgroups showed improvement with dupilumab with the exception of East European participants 
and participants with baseline body weight ≥90 kg and BMI ≥30 kg/m2.

Key Secondary endpoint 
The proportion of participants with an improvement (reduction) in weekly average WI-NRS by ≥4 
points from baseline to Week 24 was higher in the dupilumab group compared to the placebo group 
(57.7% versus 19.5%). The difference was clinically meaningful and statistically significant 
(p<0.0001). The magnitude of the itch response observed in the dupilumab group as compared to the 
placebo group at Week 24 was greater than it had been at Week 12.

versus placebo was still observed after excluding participants with active mild AD. There was a 
comparable dupilumab treatment benefit between the atopic and non-atopic subgroups, and between 
participants with a baseline IGA PN-S score of 3 (“moderate”) and 4 (“severe”). Subgroups showed a 
trend of dupilumab treatment benefit, with the exception of East Europe which showed a trend toward 
lower efficacy. The numerically lower dupilumab treatment effect observed at Week 12 in participants 
with baseline body weight ≥90 kg and in participants with baseline BMI ≥30 kg/m2 was no longer 
observed at Week 24.

quantitative treatment-by-subgroup interaction was detected with regard to stable use of TCS/TCI at 
baseline (nominal p=0.0327). Both subgroups of participants showed a similar trend of dupilumab 
treatment benefit; however, the magnitude of the treatment effect was greater in the subgroup of 
participants with a stable use of TCS/TCI at baseline (53.2% versus 11.1% in the dupilumab and 
placebo groups, respectively) as compared to the subgroup of participants with no use of TCS/TCI at 
baseline (39.3% versus 29.0%, respectively).

Analysis performed across trials 
Efficacy data from the two pivotal phase 3 studies EFC16460 (PRIME2) and EFC16459 (PRIME) were 
pooled, including all data up to the data cut-off dates of 30 August 2021 for EFC16460 and 12 
November 2021 for EFC16459. Results from the pooled analysis are described below. 
Participant flow 
Disposition of study participants 
A total of 311 pooled participants were randomized to study intervention, 153 in the dupilumab group 
and 158 in the placebo group. There were 2 (0.6%) participants (1 [0.7%] in the dupilumab group and 
1 [0.6%] in the placebo group) who were randomized but not exposed to study intervention due to the 
participants’ decision.  
In the randomized and exposed population, 265 (85.2%) participants completed the 24 week study 
intervention period. The percentage of participants permanently discontinuing study intervention was 
lower in the dupilumab group (3 [2.0%]) compared to the placebo group (41 [25.9%]).  
As of the time of the data cut-off, 73 (23.5%) participants were still ongoing in the study follow-up 
period, 195 (62.7%) participants had completed the study period (ie, entire study intervention and 
post-intervention follow-up periods), and 43 (13.8%) participants had permanently discontinued from 
the studies.

Percentages are calculated using the number of participants randomized as denominator 
Note: One participant (ID: 016460-826-0001-30003) in dupilumab group was alive at the status of last contact on 10SEP2021, but 
was not counted in this table due to data cutoff by 30AUG2021. One participant (ID: 016459-032-0003-10001) in placebo group 
was alive at the status of last contact on 24NOV2021, but was not counted in this table due to data cutoff by 12NOV2021. 
For the status of last contact, ongoing participants were excluded as the corresponding CRF page was not collected. 
Study period = study intervention period + post-intervention follow-up period. 
Baseline Data 
Demographics 
The mean age of the study participants was 49.5 years (median: 51 years with a range of 18 to 80 
years). A total of 62 (19.9%) participants were aged 65 years or older; of them, 38 participants were 
treated with dupilumab. Female participants represented 65.3% of the population. The mean (SD) 
weight was 73.90 (17.92) kg and 26.0% of the population had a BMI ≥30 kg/m2. Studies EFC16460 
and EFC16459 were conducted globally with regional representation including Asia, Latin America, 
Eastern Europe, and Western Countries; race representation included White (56.6%), Asian (34.1%), 
Black or African American (6.1%), and other races (3.2%). Of the 44 participants enrolled in both 
studies from the US, 16 (36.4%) were Black or African American.

Baseline Disease Characteristics 
The mean WI-NRS score was 8.5 (scale range 0-10, with 10 indicating worst imaginable itch), mean 
IGA PN-S score was 3.3 (scale range 0-4, with 4 indicating severe disease stage), and a mean IGA PN-
A score was 3.4. Overall, 66.3% and 33.7% of participants had an IGA PN S score of 3 (“moderate”, 
20-100 nodules) or 4 (“severe”, >100 nodules), respectively, and 55.0% and 40.5% of participants 
had an IGA PN A score of 3 (“moderate”) or 4 (“severe”), respectively. In total 99.0% of participants 
had a WI NRS score ≥7 at baseline and 100% of participants had at least 20 PN skin lesions, with a 
mean duration of PN disease of 5.6 years.  
The HRQoL of the enrolled participants as measured by DLQI, was 17.5 (scale range 0-30, with 30 
indicating the largest impact on quality of life, and 11-20 indicating a very large impact on quality of 
life). Mental health of the enrolled participants as measured by HADS, with a mean score of 15.2 (scale 
range 0-42, with a high score indicative of an abnormal anxiety and/or depression level) and a high 
proportion of participants meeting the cut-off score for anxiety with HADS-A ≥8 (58.9%) or depression 
with HADS D ≥8 (37.2%). Participants also had a high Skin Pain-NRS score (mean score 7.2, score 
range 0-10, with 10 indicating the worst possible pain) and a low Sleep Quality NRS score (mean score 
4.3, score range 0-10, with 0 indicating the worst possible sleep) at baseline. 
Overall, 43.4% of the participants in the pooled ITT population had a history or current diagnosis of 
atopy, consistent with the prespecified cap (60%) in enrolment of atopic participants, and of these 
atopic participants, 9.6% had active mild AD, consistent with the cap instituted (10% of the atopic 
population). In addition, 56.9% of participants had other comorbid conditions associated with PN; 
hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism were the most frequent ones.

Prior medications 
99.7% participants had used topical medications for the treatment of PN before study entry (TCS: 
98.4%; TCI: 11.3%) while 66.2% had used systemic medications (Antihistamines: 53.1%, non-
steroidal immunosuppressants: 20.6%; systemic corticosteroids: 17.4%; antidepressants: 8.4%). 
Concomitant medications 
Almost all participants (99.3% in the dupilumab group and 99.4% in the placebo group) received 
concomitant medications during the study. Emollients were used by 94.3% and 90.2% of the 
participants in the dupilumab and placebo group, respectively. Dermatological preparations of 
corticosteroids were used by 69.6% and 66.7% of participants in the dupilumab and placebo group, 
respectively. 
Compliance with study intervention 
Mean compliance with administration of IMP was ≥98.68% in both intervention groups. Mean 
compliance with background intervention (moisturizers [emollients]) was 88.49% and 85.02% in the in 
the dupilumab and placebo group, respectively). In those participants who used stable doses of 
TCS/TCI, mean compliance with background treatment was 87.70% in the dupilumab group and 
84.51% in the placebo group.

Proportion  of  participants  with  improvement  (reduction)  in WI-NRS  by  ≥4  points over  time 
up to Week 24 
The proportion of participants achieving an improvement (reduction) in WI-NRS of ≥4 points from 
baseline was higher in the dupilumab group compared to the placebo group, starting at Week 2. The 
treatment effect progressively increased through the rest of the 24-week intervention period and 
remained nominally significant at all subsequent weekly measurements, with the greatest treatment 
difference observed at Week 24.

In the pooled ITT population, dupilumab treatment reduced the time to first weekly average WI-NRS 
improvement (reduction) by ≥4 points from baseline as compared to placebo during the 24 week 
intervention period (HR [95% CI]: 2.341 [1.681, 3.261], nominal p<0.0001). The KM curves for first 
occurrence of weekly average WI-NRS improvement by ≥4 points from baseline for the dupilumab and 
placebo groups started to diverge as early as Week 4. The treatment effect progressively increased 
through the rest of the 24-week intervention period and remained nominally significant at all 
subsequent weekly measurements with the greatest treatment difference observed at Week 24. 
Change from baseline in WI-NRS up to Week 24 
In the pooled ITT population, the LS mean percent change from baseline to Week 12 and Week 24 in 
the weekly average WI NRS score was greater in the dupilumab group as compared to the placebo 
group (-43.90% versus -25.06% at Week 12; 53.44% versus 27.97% at Week 24). Mean values for 
dupilumab and placebo were 8.59 and 8.40 at baseline, 5.14 and 6.61 at Week 12 and 4.37 and 6.47 
at Week 24.

Proportion of participants with IGA PN-S 0 or 1 and improvement (reduction) in WI-NRS by 
≥4 points at week 24 
The proportion of participants with both an improvement (reduction) in WI-NRS by ≥4 points from 
baseline to Week 24 and an IGA PN S score of 0 or 1 at Week 24 (multicomponent endpoint) was 
defined as an additional key secondary endpoint for the US and US reference countries’ statistical 
hierarchy and was not part of the hierarchical testing procedure for the EU application. In the pooled 
ITT population, the proportion of participants with both an improvement in WI NRS by ≥4 points from 
baseline to Week 24 and achieving an IGA PN S score of 0 or 1 at Week 24 was greater in the 
dupilumab group as compared to the placebo group (35.3% versus 8.9%; nominal p<0.0001). 
Change from baseline over time in exact number of lesions 
Dupilumab treatment showed a nominally significant reduction in the exact number of lesions in the 
representative body area as measured by item 4 of the modified PAS, starting as early as Week 4. The 
treatment effect progressively increased through the rest of the 24-week intervention period with the 
greatest treatment difference observed at Week 24.  
A greater reduction in the exact number of skin lesions in the representative body area in the 
dupilumab group compared to the placebo group was demonstrated starting as early as the first post 
baseline measurement at (Week 4) ([95% CI]: -4.06 [-6.52, -1.61], nominal p=0.0012). Reduction of 
lesions progressively increased through the rest of the 24 week intervention period. The greatest 
treatment difference was observed at Week 24 (LS mean difference in change from baseline versus 
placebo [95% CI]: -11.40 [15.05, 7.75], nominal p<0.0001). In the pooled ITT population, the 
proportion of participants with an improvement (reduction) in the exact number of lesions by ≥15 
(defined as clinical meaningful threshold for item 4 of the modified PAS) from baseline to Week 24 was 
higher in the dupilumab group as compared to the placebo group (44.4% versus 20.3%, nominal

Week 4 (12.4% versus 4.4%, nominal p=0.0293). The treatment effect progressively increased 
through the rest of the 24-week intervention period and remained nominally significant at all 
subsequent measurements, with the greatest treatment difference observed at Week 24 (55.6% 
versus 19.0%, nominal p<0.0001). Upon treatment, the proportion of participants who achieved ≥75% 
healed skin lesions was higher in the dupilumab group as compared to the placebo group, starting as 
early as Week 4 (14.4% versus 6.3%, nominal p=0.0294). The treatment effect progressively 
increased through the rest of the 24-week intervention period and remained nominally significant at

Change from baseline over time up to Week 24 in DLQI 
Dupilumab treatment improved HRQoL as measured by a decrease in Dermatology Life Quality Index 
(DLQI) from baseline to Week 12 and Week 24, compared to placebo. At Week 12, the LS mean 
difference in change from baseline versus placebo was 5.11 ([95% CI:  6.43, -3.78], nominal

Overall HRQoL endpoints (EQ-5D VAS and EQ-5D-5L Single Index score)  
In the pooled ITT population, analysis of the EQ-5D-VAS, which presents the participant’s self rated 
health status on a vertical scale from 0 (“worst imaginable health state”) to 100 (“best imaginable 
health state”), showed a nominally significant improvement in the dupilumab group as compared to 
the placebo group at Week 12 (LS mean difference in change from baseline versus placebo at Week 
12: 5.24 [95% CI: 1.84, 8.65], nominal p=0.0025) and at Week 24 (LS mean difference in change 
from baseline versus placebo at Week 24: 7.17 [95% CI: 3.53, 10.80], nominal p=0.0001). 
Change from baseline to Week 24 in Sleep-NRS  
A nominally significant increase (improvement) in weekly average Sleep-NRS score from baseline to 
Week 24 was observed in the dupilumab group compared to the placebo group (LS mean difference in 
change from baseline versus placebo: 0.99 ([95% CI: 0.47, 1.50], nominal p=0.0002). The difference 
did not reach the clinically meaningful threshold between groups of 1.0. 
Change from baseline in HADS total score to Week 24 
Dupilumab treatment demonstrated a nominally significant improvement (decrease) in total HADS 
score from baseline to Week 24 as compared to placebo, with an LS mean difference in change from 
baseline versus placebo of -2.65 ([95% CI:  3.96, 1.34], nominal p<0.0001). Both the anxiety (HADS-
A) and depression (HADS D) subscores demonstrated a nominally significant improvement in the 
dupilumab group as compared to the placebo group. In the pooled ITT population, the proportion of 
participants with HADS-A subscale scores ≥8 at baseline who achieved HADS-A <8 was greater in the 
dupilumab group compared to the placebo group beginning at Week 12, with a larger treatment 
difference at Week 24 (51.6% versus 23.1%, nominal p=0.0001). The proportion of participants with 
HADS-D subscale scores ≥8 at baseline who achieved HADS D <8 was greater in the dupilumab group 
compared to the placebo group only at Week 24 (53.6% versus 25.4%, nominal p=0.0014).

Antidrug Antibodies 
The pooled ADA population consisted of all participants in the safety pooled population who had at 
least 1 non-missing ADA result after the first dose of the study intervention.  
The association between the treatment-emergent ADA response and the clinical response was 
investigated in participants using the measures of improvement (reduction) in WI NRS by ≥4 points 
from baseline to Week 12 and Week 24, the percentage of participants with IGA PN S 0 (“clear”) or 1 
(“almost clear”) score at Week 24, and the percentage of participants with both an improvement 
(reduction) in WI NRS by ≥4 points from baseline to Week 24 and IGA PN S 0 or 1 score at Week 24.  
Overall, in the dupilumab group: 
▪  4 of the 11 (36.4%) ADA-positive participants and 57 (43.2%) ADA-negative participants achieved 
an improvement (reduction) in weekly average WI-NRS by ≥4 points from baseline to Week 12. 
▪  6 of the 11 (54.5%) ADA-positive participants and 81 (61.4%) ADA-negative participants achieved 
an improvement (reduction) in weekly average WI-NRS by ≥4 points from baseline to Week 24. 
▪  4 of the 11 (36.4%) ADA-positive participants and 65 (49.2%) ADA-negative participants achieved 
an IGA PN-S score of 0 or 1 at Week 24. 
▪  3 of the 11 (27.3%) ADA-positive participants and 49 (37.1%) ADA-negative participants achieved 
both an improvement in WI-NRS by ≥4 points from baseline to Week 24 and an IGA PN-S 0 or 1 
score at Week 24. 
Overall, in the dupilumab group: 
▪  1 of the 4 participants with a Nab positive response demonstrated an improvement in WI NRS by

▪  3 of the 4 participants with a Nab positive response demonstrated an improvement in WI NRS by 
≥4 points from baseline to Week 24. 
▪  1 of the 4 participants with a Nab positive response demonstrated an improvement in the 
proportion of participants with an IGA PN S 0 or 1 score at Week 24. 
▪  1 of the 4 participants with a Nab positive response demonstrated both an improvement in WI-NRS

Subgroup analyses 
In the pooled ITT population, the consistency of treatment effects in the primary, key secondary, and 
other selected efficacy endpoints (ie, percent change from baseline to Week 24 in WI-NRS and 
proportion of participants with IGA PN-S 0 or 1 score at Week 24) were assessed across various 
subgroups, including demographics and baseline characteristics, PN disease characteristics at baseline, 
atopic comorbidity history, and concomitant or background medications. 
Subgroup analyses - Participants with an improvement (reduction) in WI-NRS by ≥4 points 
from baseline to Week 24 
Results from subgroup analyses for the treatment effect of dupilumab on the proportion of participants 
with an improvement (reduction) in weekly average WI-NRS by ≥4 points from baseline to Week 24 are 
shown in the Figure below.  
All 3 subgroups based on BMI showed a dupilumab treatment benefit; however, the magnitude of the 
treatment effect was greater in the subgroup of participants with baseline BMI ≥25 to <30 kg/m2 
(75.5% in the dupilumab group versus 13.7% in the placebo group) as compared to the subgroup of

participants with baseline BMI <25 kg/m2 (50.0% versus 24.3%), or the subgroup of participants with 
baseline BMI ≥30 kg/m2 (50.0% versus 17.6%).  
The odds ratio or 95% CI could not be calculated (ie, NE) in some specific subgroup categories: 
Age: A higher responder rate was observed in the dupilumab group as compared to the placebo group 
in the subgroup of participants aged ≥65 to >75 years (19/30 [63.3%] versus 3/17 [17.6%]) and in 
the subgroup of participants aged ≥75 years (3/8 [37.5%] versus 1/7 [14.3%]).  
Race: A higher responder rate was observed in the dupilumab group as compared to the placebo group 
in the subgroup category of participants of Black/African Descent (5/11 [45.5%] versus 1/8 [12.5%]) 
and in the subgroup category “Others” (2/5 [40.0%] versus 1/5 [20.0%]), with a similar trend to that 
observed in Asian (32/54 [59.3%] versus 8/52 [15.4%]) and Caucasian (51/83 [61.4%] versus 20/93 
[21.5%]) participants. 
Body weight: A higher responder rate was observed in the dupilumab group as compared to the 
placebo group in the subgroup of participants with baseline body weight <60 kg (15/33 [45.5%] 
versus 7/34 [20.6%]), which was similar to the responder rates observed in the higher body weight 
groups ≥60 to <90 kg (63/93 [67.7%] versus 18/98 [18.4%]), and ≥90 kg (12/27 [44.4%] versus 
5/25 [20%]).  
Disseminated or localized PN lesions: No meaningful conclusions could be drawn in the subgroup of 
participants with disseminated or localized PN lesions ≤2 BSA due to the small number of participants 
in this category (3 participants). 
Phototherapy use: In those participants who had a prior history of phototherapy use, 75% (9/12) in 
the dupilumab group were responders compared to 7.7% (1/13) in the placebo group. In those 
participants who did not have a prior history of phototherapy use, 57.4% (81/141) in the dupilumab 
group were responders compared to 20.0% (29/145) in the placebo group. The responder rates 
suggest that there was a similar trend of dupilumab benefit.

Subgroup analyses for the treatment effect of dupilumab on the proportion of participants with an IGA 
PN S 0 (“clear”) or 1 (“almost clear”) score at Week 24 are shown in the figure below. 
A significant quantitative treatment-by-subgroup interaction was detected with regard to stable use of 
TCS/TCI (nominal p=0.0287). While the magnitude of the treatment effect was greater in the 
subgroup of participants with stable use of TCS/TCI at baseline (dupilumab: 48.4%; placebo: 11.0%) 
as compared to the subgroup of participants with no use of TCS/TCI (dupilumab: 43.5%; placebo: 
25.4%), the treatment difference was driven by a lower placebo response, while the dupilumab 
responder rate was similar. Given a similar trend of dupilumab benefit that was statistically significant 
between both subgroup categories, this interaction is unlikely to be clinically meaningful. 
A trend toward a lower magnitude of dupilumab treatment effect was observed in the subgroup of 
participants who were taking stable doses of antidepressants at baseline based on an OR of 0.9. 
However, a numerically higher responder rate in the dupilumab group compared to the placebo group 
was observed in participants who were taking stable doses of antidepressants (6/16 [37.5%] versus 
4/17 [23.5%]), which was a similar trend to that shown in the dupilumab responder rate in those 
participants who were not taking antidepressants (65/137 [47.4%] versus 23/141 [16.3%]). 
While a trend toward a higher magnitude of dupilumab treatment effect was observed in male 
participants as compared to female participants, both subgroups showed a higher responder rate in the 
dupilumab group as compared to the placebo group (26/49 [53.1%] versus 8/59 [13.6%] in males, 
and 45/104 [43.3%] versus 19/99 [19.2%] in females) that was statistically significant and clinically 
meaningful in both genders. 
The odds ratio or 95% CI could not be calculated (ie, NE) in some specific subgroup categories: 
Age: A higher responder rate was observed in the dupilumab group as compared to the placebo group 
in the subgroup of participants aged ≥75 years (4/8 [50.0%] versus 0/7 [0%]) which is a similar trend 
of dupilumab treatment effect to that observed in other age subcategories.  
Race: A higher responder rate was observed in the dupilumab group as compared to the placebo group 
in the subgroup category of participants of Black/African descent (4/11 [36.4%] versus 1/8 [12.5%]) 
and in the subgroup category “Others” (2/5 [40.0%] versus 1/5 [20.0%]), which was a similar trend of 
dupilumab treatment benefit to that observed in Asian (25/54 [46.3%] versus 7/52 [13.5%]) and 
Caucasian participants (40/83 [48.2%] versus 18/93 [19.4%]). No meaningful conclusions could be 
drawn for the race category “Others” due to the small number of participants.

placebo group in the subgroup of participants with baseline body weight ≥90 kg (13/27 [48.1%] versus

Efficacy in participants with or without use of stable doses of TCS/TCI 
182 (58.5%) participants had stable concomitant use of low-to-medium potency TCS/TCI during the 
treatment intervention period. 
The proportion of participants with improvement in WI-NRS by ≥4 points from baseline to Week 24 
was observed in participants with or without stable use of TCS/TCI, with a numerically greater 
treatment effect in those participants who used TCS/TCI. At Week 12, the proportion of participants 
with improvement in WI NRS by ≥4 points did not meet nominal statistical significance in those 
participants who did not use stable TCS/TCI (p=0.0869) but did reach nominal significance in those 
participants who used stable doses of TCS/TCI (p<0.0001).  
The proportion of participants with IGA PN S 0 (“clear”) or 1 (“almost clear”) score at Week 24 was

The proportion of participants with an improvement (reduction) in WI-NRS by ≥4 points from baseline 
observed at Week 24 in the dupilumab group decreased from 58.8% (90/153) to 47.1% (48/102) at 
the end of the 12-week post-intervention follow-up period. In contrast, within the placebo group the 
number of responders at Week 24 increased from 19.0% (30/158) to 28.0% (26/93).

Off treatment, participants showed a gradual loss of response through Week 36 (-40.10%; n=102), 
compared with that observed at Week 24. There was no rebound (worsening of disease above 
baseline) observed in the dupilumab treatment group for any of the endpoints evaluated during the 
follow-up period.

data after study intervention discontinuation for lack of efficacy were imputed by WOCF. 
Ongoing participants who have missing data at a timepoint after Week 24 due to the data cut at the primary database lock or 
discontinued study participants who could not reach this timepoint from randomization date are excluded from this timepoint. 
Among the participants who were responders at Week 24, the rate of loss of response was 
approximately 38.7% and 31.4 % by Week 36 within the dupilumab and placebo group, respectively. A 
significant proportion of participants in both treatment groups are still ongoing in the follow up period 
and censored for KM estimates.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Efficacy data for the new indication PN is derived from the 2 pivotal, phase 3, replicate studies 
EFC16460 (PRIME 2) and EFC16459 (PRIME). Both studies were designed as multinational, 
multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies, to assess the 
efficacy and safety of dupilumab in adult participants with PN whose disease was inadequately 
controlled on topical prescription therapies or when those therapies were not advisable. The studies 
included 24-week treatment and a 12 week follow-up period. Dupilumab was administered 
subcutaneously 300 mg, Q2W (after an initial loading dose of 600mg) which is the approved dosing 
regimen for adult patients with AD and for patients ≥12 years with asthma. Efficacy data were 
provided based on the primary data base lock for both studies. 
Studies EFC16460 and EFC16459 included participants with diagnosis of PN with an age range of 18-80 
years. Participants with an average score of ≥7 (range 0-10) in the worst-itch numeric scale (WI-NRS) 
within 7 days prior to the start of treatment (indicating severe pruritus) and with a minimum of 20 PN 
lesions (grade 3: moderate or grade 4 on the IGA-PN score) were eligible. Only participants with a 
history of failing to treatment with medium-to-superpotent TCS or when TCS were medically not 
advisable were included. Participants who were on a stable regimen of low to medium potency TCS or 
TCI at the screening visit were allowed to continue their topical TCS or TCI application once daily, 
without tapering, from screening to Week 24. Secondary PN due to other skin morbidities, medications 
and other medical conditions were excluded. Recruitment of participants with a history of atopy 
(medical history of AD, allergic rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma, or food allergy) were capped at 
60% and up to 10% of the enrolled atopic participants were allowed to have active mild AD; moderate-
to-severe AD was excluded. 
The goal of this design was to mirror the overall PN patient population consistent with real-world 
estimates of overall prevalence while trying to minimize potential confounders on the efficacy 
evaluations.  
Overall, the protocol-defined patient population of studies EFC16460 and EFC16459 is considered to be 
appropriate to evaluate the effects of dupilumab in PN. As there are no authorised systemic treatments 
for PN, a placebo control design can be accepted. 
The primary objective of both studies was to evaluate the effect of dupilumab on the itch response in 
PN using the proportion of participants with improvement (reduction) in WI-NRS by ≥4 from baseline to 
week 12 (EFC16460) or week 24 (EFC16459) as primary endpoint. This reflects an improvement in the 
WI-NRS score from severe pruritus (>7) to moderate pruritus (>3). The WI-NRS is a patient-reported 
outcome comprised of a single item, rated on a scale from 0 (“no itch”) to 10 (“worst imaginable itch”) 
that has been recently validated for PN. The choice of the primary endpoint is reasonable given that 
severe itch is the cardinal symptom of PN that drives the itch-scratch cycle leading to the PN lesions 
and that also have a dominant effect on the participant’s quality of life.  
Initially, the timing for the primary endpoint in studies EFC16460 and EFC16459 was identical. 
However, after the primary analysis of study EFC16460 (data cut-off: 27-Sept-2021) the ongoing 
study EFC16459 was amended on 21-Oct-2021 to move the timing of the primary endpoint from week 
12 to week 24 based on the efficacy data observed within study EFC16460. The rather late change of 
primary endpoint adds uncertainty. However, the consistency of results from both studies provide 
reassurance and sufficient clarification was provided by the MAH in response to the Request for 
Supplementary Information with regard to the timing of patient flow for both studies. One month after

the first pre-planned database lock for Study ECF16460, and following an analysis of the data relating 
to the P.E.P. at Week 12, a protocol amendment was implemented for Study ECF16459 to delay 
measurement of the P.E.P. until Week 24. This was based on preliminary efficacy findings supporting 
this change. This change of primary endpoint was sufficiently substantiated and did not raise further 
concerns. 
Both studies planned to randomise n=150 patients (n=75 per group), in order to have 90% power to 
detect the difference of 28% between dupilumab and placebo at the 2-sided significance level of 0.05. 
The primary analysis was planned to be conducted by means of a Cochrane-Mantel-Haenszel test 
stratified by history of atopy (atopic or non-atopic), stable use of TCS/TCI (yes or no), and region 
(countries combined) and covariate of baseline anti-depressant use (yes or no). The analysis was 
planned to be conducted in the ITT set, comprising all randomized subjects regardless if treatment kit 
is used or not. 
The primary estimand is a composite estimand, participants taking selected prohibited medications 
and/or rescue medications prior to week 12 (week 24 in study EFC16459) were planned to be 
considered non-responders. In light of different patterns for the intercurrent event of taking selected 
prohibited medications and/or rescue medications this strategy was not fully supported by the CHMP as 
it may favour the dupilumab arm. At the CHMP’s request, the MAH provided sensitivity analysis 
addressing a treatment policy estimand, using all observed data irrespective of the intercurrent event. 
This as-observed analyses are considered more robust and relevant and are preferred as basis for the 
regulatory decision.  
Similarly, participants with missing values were also considered non-responders and in light of higher 
discontinuation rates in the control groups, there was uncertainty whether the dupilumab group might 
have been favoured by this approach. Additional analyses provided by the MAH suggested that results 
are robust. Given that numerical results differ only very little between the analyses targeting the 
different estimands, the CHMP agreed to include the results of the prespecified analysis in section 5.1 
of the SmPC.  
The proportion of participants with IGA PN-S score of 0 or 1 at week 24 (representing 0-5 nodules) 
was used as key secondary endpoint to further evaluate the effect of dupilumab on the number of PN 
skin lesions. Other objectives were to demonstrate improvement of HRQoL, skin pain, sleep quality, 
and mental health. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In study EFC16460, 160 participants (dupilumab: 82; placebo: 78) were randomized and 151 
participants (dupilumab: 75; placebo: 76) were randomized in study EFC16459 leading to a total of 
311 participants in the pooled ITT population. Participants had active disease at baseline with a mean 
WI-NRS score of 8.5, with 66.3% and 33.7% of participants having an IGA PN-S score of 3 (moderate) 
or 4 (severe), respectively, and 55.0% and 40.5% of participants having an IGA PN-A score of 3 
(moderate) or 4 (severe), respectively. 43.4% of the participants had a history or current diagnosis of 
atopy, 9.6% had active mild AD. 58.5% participants received background medication with TCS or TCI 
and were required to be on stable dosing regimen (maintaining the same medicine (low to medium 
potency TCS) and the same frequency used from 2 weeks prior to screening). In the randomized and 
exposed population, 265 (85.2%) participants completed the 24 week study intervention period. The 
percentage of participants permanently discontinuing study intervention was lower in the dupilumab 
group (3 [2.0%]) compared to the placebo group (41 [25.9%]). This was mainly driven by a higher 
proportion of participants in the placebo group that discontinued treatment due to lack of efficacy 
either as reasons for discontinuation by the Investigator or as the reason for withdrawal by the subject 
Assessment report

indicating a treatment effect of dupilumab. At the time of the primary data cut-off, 195 (62.7%) 
participants had completed the study period (i.e., entire study intervention and post-intervention 
follow-up periods). Of note, 73 participants (55 [34.4%] in EFC16460 and 18 [11.9%] in EFC16459) 
were still ongoing in the follow-up period (38 in the dupilumab group and 35 in the placebo group) 
which accounts for 23.5% of exposed participants. At the CHMP request, complete efficacy data for the 
ITT population were provided based on the final database lock of both PN studies. Updated efficacy 
data are overall consistent with the conclusion for the efficacy data bases on the primary data base 
lock that are further described below. 
Both studies, EFC16460 and EFC16459, reached the primary endpoint as well as key secondary 
endpoints.   
In study EFC16460, at Week 12 the proportion of participants with a reduction in the WI-NRS by ≥4 
from baseline (primary endpoint) was significantly higher in the dupilumab group as compared to the 
placebo group (37.2% versus 22.0%; p=0.0216). Similar differences were observed in study 
EFC16459 (44.0% versus 15.8%, p=0.0003) where however the timing of the primary endpoint was 
moved from Week 12 to Week 24. In study EFC16459, at Week 24 a higher proportion of participants 
with reduction in WI-NRS by ≥4 points (primary endpoint) can be observed (60.0% versus 18.4%; 
p<0.0001) that were also consistent with the effect observed at Week 24 in EFC16460 (57.7% versus 
19.5%).  
Subsequently, in the pooled ITT population a significant difference is observed at Week 12 in the 
dupilumab group (40.5% versus 19.0%; p<0.0001) that was further increased at Week 24 (58.8% 
versus 19.0%; p<0.0001). The treatment effect of dupilumab started to appear within the first weeks 
and further increased over time.  
Mean change and mean percent changes of WI-NRS over time up to Week 24 were both similar and 
overall consistent with the observed reduction in itch severity (WI-NRS reduction of ≥4) points 
showing show a mean reduction of -4.77 and -2.65 and a mean percent change of -53.44 and -27.97 
at Week 24 for dupilumab and placebo respectively. A continuous reduction in WI-NRS is observed to a 
lesser extent in the placebo group. The overall reduction in WI-NRS at Week 24 by 2.2 points in the 
dupilumab group as compared to placebo is supportive for the beneficial treatment effect of dupilumab 
seen for the primary endpoint. 
Regarding the key secondary endpoint a significantly difference in the proportion of participants with 
an IGA PN-S score of 0 or 1 (indicating no or only a low number of PN lesions) was observed at Week 
24 (dupilumab: 71 (46.4%); placebo: 27 (17.1%); p<0.0001) in the pooled ITT population. This 
treatment effect of dupilumab on PN lesions was consistent between both pivotal studies and do overall 
indicate a profound reduction of PN lesions after dupilumab treatment. Still, the number of responders 
for the secondary endpoint (IGA PN-S score 0 or 1) is lower as compared to the number of responders 
for the primary endpoint (improvement by ≥4 points in the WI-NRS score) indicating a limited 
correlation between reduction in the severity of pruritus and reduction of PN lesions.  
The quality of PN lesions was further assessed using the IGA PN-Score that evaluates the percent of 
nodules that show excoriations and/or crusts showing a nominally significant at Week 12 and Week 24, 
with the greatest treatment difference observed at Week 24 (56.2% versus 18.4%, nominal 
p<0.0001). These data indicate that similar to the observed overall improvement in PN lesions, as 
seen by reduction in PN-S score, an improved healing of remaining PN lesions can be observed after 
dupilumab treatment. 
Consistent with the observed reduction of itch severity and PN lesions a significant improvement in 
DLQI and Skin Pain-NRS was observed at Week 24. A similar trend towards improved quality of life at 
Week 24 is also noted in Sleep-NRS and HADS while nominal p-values are reported as these were not

part of the hierarchical testing procedure or the procedure broke before the analysis. Overall, the 
improvement in the above mentioned scores supports the beneficial effect of dupilumab on patients’ 
quality of life. 
Subgroup analyses showed an overall lowered efficacy for the primary and key secondary outcomes in 
participants with high BMI or high body weight. Body weight has been previously identified as the 
primary factor responsible for dupilumab PK variability in the other approved indications. No dose 
adjustment is recommended with respect to body weight or BMI in the PN population by the MAH as it 
does not significantly impair the efficacy. This is considered acceptable by the CHMP.   
Only 6.1% of subjects enrolled in the pivotal studies were Black or African American despite the fact 
that PN is more common in this patient population. A total of 19 Black or African American subjects 
were enrolled across the two studies, and 11 of these were randomised to receive dupilumab. Thus, 
uncertainty regarding the dupilumab treatment effect remains which is, however, sufficiently reflected 
in the current wording of the SmPC. 
In the ITT population, 58.5% of participants used stable TCS/TCI during the studies with stable 
regimen defined as the administration of the same medication (low to medium potency TCS) at the 
same frequency (once or twice daily) used continuously starting from 2 weeks prior to screening. 
These participants were required to continue their topical application once daily without tapering from 
Screening to Week 24.  
With regard to the primary and key secondary outcomes of studies EFC16460 and EFC16459, a 
treatment response with dupilumab was seen in participants with and without use of TCS/TCI at Week 
24 whereas at Week 12 a significance was only reached in participants with use of TCS/TCI. Of note, 
there appears to be no additive treatment effect of dupilumab as treatment responses in the 
dupilumab group were similar between both, WI-NRS and PN-S responses. There is however, an 
apparent imbalance in the placebo group in the number of responders in participants without use of 
TCS/TCI as compared to participants that received TCS/TCI. Overall, these data indicate a treatment 
effect of dupilumab irrespective of whether TCS/TCI were used. Additional figures showing the WI-NRS 
response over time in subgroups of participants with and without stable use of TCS/TCI were provided 
in response to the Request for Supplementary Information and did not give rise for further concerns on 
this efficacy aspect. 
Further analyses for loss of response in WI-NRS or PN-S responders were provided by the MAH 
suggesting a loss of treatment effect within the 12-week follow-up period effect after administration of 
dupilumab was discontinued. Overall, efficacy data from the 12-week follow-up period suggest a loss of 
response after discontinuation of dupilumab treatment that is irrespective to changes in the TCS/TCI 
background therapy during the follow-up period. This information has been included in section 5.1 of 
the SmPC: “Once treatment was discontinued after 24 weeks, there was an indication towards 
recurrence of signs and symptoms within the 12-week follow-up period.” 
The loss of response after 12 weeks is only suggested with the present data and a longer follow-up 
period would have been more appropriate to evaluate the maintenance of efficacy of dupilumab in PN 
as also suggested by the prior Scientific Advice procedure. Therefore, no information is available for 
healthcare professionals (HCPs) and patients regarding long-term use, nor withdrawal and 
retreatment. Information on missing efficacy data beyond week 24 were added in section 4.2 of the 
SmPC “PN clinical trial data are available for patients treated up to 24 weeks.” 
The MAH claimed that “Dupilumab is intended for long-term treatment”. This was not supported by the 
CHMP as clinical data for dupilumab treatment in PN are only available for a treatment period of 24 
weeks and no further clinical data are planned to be generated in PN by the MAH. The MAH’s 
justification for this initial claim is based on the immunological similarities between AD and PN with 
Assessment report  
EMA/9410/2023  
Page 92/141 
 
 
 
 
regard to type-2 inflammation and pruritus development. It is argued that the similar clinical 
responses seen in AD can enable transfer of data and conclusions on treatment efficacy and long-term 
treatment maintenance from the more extensive AD development program (including 52-week 
treatment as well as OLE data) to the PN population. While it may be assumed that data on long-term 
treatment with dupilumab in PN can be similar to the other indications for which dupilumab is already 
approved (AD in particular), this would have to be demonstrated by further clinical data to exclude 
disease-specific differences in the treatment response and upon treatment discontinuation on a long-
term base. Since the MAH didn’t plan to generate further clinical data in the long-term use, they have 
submitted a revised wording to remove the use in long term treatment. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy results from the two pivotal phase 3 studies (EFC16460 and EFC16459) demonstrated that 
the 300mg Q2W dose regimen provided statistically significant reductions in the severity of pruritus 
and the number of PN lesions (as measured by WI-NRS and PN-S scores) at Week 24 compared to 
placebo, in adult patients with PN whose disease was inadequately controlled on topical prescription 
therapies or when those therapies were not advisable. 
The treatment effect was observed in participants with moderate and severe disease, atopic and non-
atopic participants and was irrespective of whether stable concomitant topical therapy was applied or 
not. Uncertainties regarding the demonstration of efficacy in the patient population of Black and 
African American remain as the number of included participants was limited, however, this is 
sufficiently reflected in the current wording of the SmPC. 
A major limitation is missing long-term efficacy data since both studies only included a 24-week 
treatment period. At Week 12, the treatment effect was significant for the primary and secondary 
endpoints in both studies. However, the effect was overall low in studies EFC16460 and continued to 
increase beyond Week 24. Accordingly, the timing for the primary endpoint was changed in study 
EFC16459 from Week 12 to Week 24 prior to the database lock. Overall, the greatest treatment effect 
for dupilumab was observed at Week 24. Further data on the maintenance of long-term efficacy 
beyond Week 24 are missing and the MAH currently does not plan to conduct any further studies in PN. 
Therefore, the initial claim for long-term use was not acceptable to the CHMP. The MAH submitted a 
revised indication claim in which the long-term treatment has been removed.  
Updated complete efficacy data for the ITT population were provided within the MAHs response to the 
Request for Supplementary Information. First indications for a loss-of-response in the dupilumab group 
were noted after treatment discontinuation in the 12-week follow-up period that corresponds to the 
time to complete clearance of dupilumab. This is adequately reflected in Section 5.1. 
Overall, the improvements seen at Week 12 and Week 24 in the primary and secondary endpoints of 
the pivotal studies are considered clinically meaningful and support the approval of dupilumab in adult 
patients with PN from an efficacy point-of-view. From an efficacy point of view, the new indication: 
“Dupixent is indicated for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe prurigo nodularis (PN) who 
are candidates for systemic therapy” is approvable.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Dupilumab was first approved in the European Union (EU) in September 2017. As of the time of the 
data cut-off for this dossier, dupilumab is approved in the EU for multiple atopic diseases, including the 
treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD; adults and adolescents), severe atopic 
dermatitis (children 6 to 11 years), severe asthma with type 2 inflammation (adults and adolescents), 
and for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) in adults. An application 
for the new indication eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE; adolescents 12 years and older) has been 
submitted in parallel to this PN application. 
The primary safety pool in the AD submission consisted of dupilumab 300 mg Q2W and QW dose 
groups from three placebo-controlled studies of 16 week treatment duration.  
The primary safety pool in the asthma submission consisted of dupilumab 300 mg Q2W and 200 mg 
Q2W dose groups from 2 placebo-controlled studies of 24-week and 52-week treatment duration, 
respectively. The safety profile observed in the AD primary safety pool was similar to that observed in 
the asthma safety pool with few differences. 
In the AD studies (primary safety pool), a greater proportion of patients in dupilumab groups reported 
TEAEs related to conjunctivitis than placebo. These imbalances were not observed in the asthma 
studies. In the CRSwNP studies, incidences for conjunctivitis (broad and narrow) in dupilumab-treated 
patients were lower than the percentages for AD and similar to those of asthma, although higher 
compared to placebo group. In the CRSwNP studies, conjunctivitis was typically mild/moderate in 
intensity (none severe/serious or requiring treatment discontinuation) and required primarily topical 
treatment with full recovery. Herpes infections (excluding eczema herpeticum) also occurred in AD 
studies at a higher incidence in dupilumab-treated patients compared to placebo, and were balanced in 
CRSwNP and asthma studies. 
In one asthma study (EFC13579), a numerical imbalance for SAEs under (MedDRA SOC) cardiac 
disorders (placebo: 0/634 [0.0%]; dupilumab (200mg Q2W): 4/631 [0.6%]; dupilumab 300mg Q2W: 
10/632 [1.6%]. However, a broad database search for CV events followed by a blinded adjudication 
analysis by 3 independent cardiologists did not support a notable difference in the safety profile 
between dupilumab and placebo for MACE, MACE plus hospitalization for unstable angina events, as 
well as for CV deaths. A similar imbalance has not been observed in any other placebo controlled study 
in asthma, AD, or CRSwNP. 
Across all studies for asthma, AD and CRSwNP, dupilumab-treated subjects have shown a greater 
mean, initial and transient, increase from baseline in blood eosinophil levels compared to 
placebo, which was predominantly a laboratory finding without any associated AEs. However, in Phase 
3 asthma studies (EFC13579, EFC13691, and LTS12551) and Phase 3 CRSwNP studies (EFC14146 and 
EFC14280) investigators were instructed to report elevations of eosinophil counts >3.0 Giga/L as a 
TEAE, whether or not the increased eosinophil count was associated with symptoms. This is reflected in 
higher incidence of PTs under (HLT) Eosinophilic disorders and (PT) Eosinophil count increased, in 
asthma and to a lesser extent in CRSwNP, as compared to AD where reporting asymptomatic 
eosinophilia was not required.

In asthma Study EFC13579, a numerically greater proportion of patients reported TEAEs under 
(MedDRA SOC) hepatobiliary disorders in the dupilumab group than placebo. A similar imbalance 
has not been observed in any other placebo controlled study, either in asthma, AD and CRSwNP. In 
addition, PTs of which had higher relative risk in dupilumab-treated patients in the CRSwNP studies, 
were compared to the AD and asthma indications. The rates for the PTs hypertension and 
arthralgia, were similar to those observed in patients with AD, asthma or CRSwNP treated with 
dupilumab 300 mg q2w.

Safety Data for PN 
Main safety data 
The main safety population is derived from pooled safety from the 2 pivotal phase 3 studies, EFC16460 
and EFC16459 that included a 24-week treatment period and a 12-week follow up. Participants in the 
dupilumab group were treated 300mg Q2W after an initial loading dose of 600mg (see Section 2.5.2 
for further description). The off-treatment follow-up period of the 2 studies currently remains ongoing 
for 23.6 % participants (55 in EFC16460 and 18 in EFC16459) at the time of the data cut-off 
(EFC16460: 30 August 2021; EFC16459: 12 November 2021).

Analyses were performed on the safety population, defined as all participants randomly assigned to 
study intervention and who took at least 1 dose of study intervention. Participants were analysed 
according to the intervention they actually received.  
The observation period for the main safety population consisted of:  
▪ 
▪ 
Pre-treatment period:  
period up to first IMP administration. 
Treatment-emergent period:  
period from the first IMP administration to the last IMP 
▪ 
Post-treatment period:  
period starting after the end of the treatment emergent period 
administration  +  98  days  and  including  the  on-treatment 
period  
Supportive safety data 
SUSARs  and  deaths  reported  from  ongoing  Phase  1/2/3  and  Phase  4  interventional  studies  with 
dupilumab in other indications are further provided as supportive safety data. 
Patient exposure 
Main safety population (Study EFC16460 & EFC16459) 
Disposition 
The main safety population comprised 309 participants (152 in the dupilumab group and 157 in the 
placebo group) from Studies EFC16460 and EFC16459. Among the 309 participants treated, 265 
(85.8%) completed the 24 week study intervention period and 44 (14.2%) prematurely discontinued 
the intervention. At the time of the data cut-off, 23.6% of the participants have currently not 
completed the treatment follow-up period. A lower percentage of participants discontinued the study 
intervention in the dupilumab group as compared to the placebo group (2.0% and 26.1%, 
respectively); the main reasons for permanent study intervention discontinuation prior to Week 24 
were withdrawal by participant (0.7% and 11.5%, respectively) and lack of efficacy (0.7% and 10.2%, 
respectively). None of the premature intervention discontinuation in the dupilumab group was due to 
an AE.

Percentages are calculated using the number of participants in the Safety population with a non-missing duration of exposure as 
denominator 
Note: Two injections for loading dose on Day 1. 
Compliance to study and background intervention 
Participants in both dupilumab and placebo groups had a high (≥98.7%) mean injection compliance 
rate, with no difference observed between intervention groups. Accidental IMP overdose was reported 
for 9 (5.9%) participants in the dupilumab group and 7 (4.5%) participants in the placebo group. None 
of these participants experienced any symptoms.  
Mean compliance to background intervention was generally high throughout the studies and similar 
between intervention groups (91.32% and 88.81% from baseline to Week 12 in the dupilumab and 
placebo participants, respectively, and 89.80% and 86.30% from baseline to Week 24, respectively). 
Medical history 
Atopic history 
134 (43.4%) participants (66 [43.4%] in the dupilumab group and 68 [43.3%] in the placebo group) 
had a history of atopic comorbidity at baseline including any of the following diseases: atopic 
dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma, food allergy, and eosinophilic 
esophagitis. Of these, 51 (16.5%) participants had ≥2 atopic comorbidities. The most frequently 
reported ongoing atopic condition was allergic rhinitis (25.0% participants in the dupilumab group and 
19.7% participants in the placebo group). 
Comorbidities and medical or surgical history 
The most frequently reported non-atopic, non medical/surgical histories in the safety pool were 
comorbid conditions associated with PN (57.9% participants in the dupilumab group and 55.4% 
participants in the placebo group). By PT, the 3 most commonly reported conditions were hypertension 
(22.7%), type 2 diabetes mellitus (9.4%), and hypothyroidism (8.4%). Events under the SOC 
Psychiatric disorders were reported in 14.9% participants overall, with depression and anxiety being 
the most common PTs (5.8% and 4.9%, respectively). Overall, the most frequently reported non-
atopic and non-comorbid conditions in the pooled safety population included gastroesophageal reflux 
disease (23 [7.4%] participants), appendicectomy (20 [6.5%] participants), caesarean section, and 
menopause (both 18 [5.8%] participants).  
Prior medications 
The most commonly used prior medications by standardized medication name were emollients and 
protectives (39.2%), clobetasol propionate (29.8%), mometasone furoate (23.0%), clobetasol 
(15.5%), betamethasone dipropionate and all other non-therapeutic products (13.9% each), 
hydroxyzine hydrochloride and methylprednisolone aceponate (11.3% each), and betamethasone 
valerate (11.0%) These prior medications were primarily used for the treatment of PN. 
Assessment report  
EMA/9410/2023  
Page 99/141 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Almost all participants in the safety pool (308/309, 99.7%) had received topical medications and 
66.7% had used systemic medications for PN before first IMP injection. The most frequently used 
medications within these 2 classes were TCS (98.4%) and antihistamines (53.4%), respectively, with 
similar proportions of participants in the dupilumab and placebo treatment groups. Systemic non-
steroidal immunosuppressants were used by 20.7% of participants (dupilumab: 23.7%; placebo: 
17.8%), antidepressants by 8.4% of participants (7.2% and 9.6%), gabapentinoids by 2.6% (3.3% 
and 1.9%), and opioid receptor antagonists by 2.3% of participants (2.6% and 1.9%). Phototherapy 
(8.1% of participants) was the most frequently reported prior procedure (7.9% and 8.3%). 
Concomitant medication 
All participants received at least 1 concomitant medication during the study. The concomitant 
medications taken by the highest number of participants in either dupilumab or placebo groups by 
standardized medication name were emollients and protectives (39.5% and 36.9%), mometasone 
furoate (13.8% and 18.5%), tozinameran (12.5% and 6.4%), acetylsalicylic acid (9.9% and 3.8%), 
and paracetamol (9.9% and 12.7%). Concomitant prohibited medications were used by 7 (4.6%) and 
22 (14.0%) participants in the dupilumab and placebo groups, respectively, with systemic 
immunosuppressive/ immunomodulating drugs used by 1.3% in the dupilumab group and 11.5% in 
the placebo group. High potency or superpotent TCS were also initiated as rescue medications by a 
lower percentage of participants in the dupilumab group compared to the placebo group (7.2% and 
21.7%, respectively). As of the cut-off date for these studies, 25.0% in dupilumab group and 21.7% in 
placebo group received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. 
Adverse events 
Overall summary of treatment emergent adverse events 
The percentage of participants who reported at least 1 TEAE was 63.8% in the dupilumab group and 
56.7% in the placebo group. Treatment-emergent SAEs occurred in 4.6% versus 7.6% participants in 
the dupilumab and placebo groups, respectively. TEAEs leading to permanent intervention 
discontinuation were reported in 0% of dupilumab-treated participants versus 2.5% in the placebo 
group. No deaths were reported in either intervention group during the intervention period.

The most frequent TEAEs by SOC (≥10% in either intervention group) were Infections and infestations 
(dupilumab: 24.3%; placebo: 23.6%), Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (dupilumab: 16.4%; 
placebo: 14.6%), and Nervous system disorders (dupilumab 12.5%; placebo: 10.2%). 
The incidence of TEAEs at the SOC level was generally similar in the dupilumab and the placebo 
groups, with the exception of Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders and Gastrointestinal 
disorders, where TEAEs were reported with a higher incidence in the dupilumab group, mainly driven 
by the HLGT of joint disorders and the PT of diarrhoea for the 2 respective SOCs.  
At the PT level, TEAEs reported more frequently (≥1% higher) in the dupilumab group compared to 
placebo were:  
•

Treatment-emergent adverse events by Investigator causality assessment 
The percentage of participants with TEAEs assessed by the Investigator as related to IMP was 17.1% in 
the dupilumab group and 13.4% in the placebo group. 
The SOC General disorders and administration site conditions had the highest proportion of 
participants with IMP-related TEAEs (7 [4.6%] and 11 [7.0%] participants in the dupilumab and 
placebo group, respectively), followed by Infections and infestations (9 [5.9%] versus 2 [1.3%]). At 
the PT level, the most frequently reported events were in the placebo group: injection site pain (0.7% 
versus 3.2%) and neurodermatitis (1.3% versus 2.5%). TEAEs of conjunctivitis allergic were 
considered related to the IMP in 2.0% of dupilumab participants versus 0% in the placebo group, and 
TEAEs of injection site reactions in 2.0% and 1.3% in the 2 respective groups.

Table 40. Number (%) of participants with treatment emergent AE(s) by Primary SOC and PT by 
severity- Pooled safety population 
Within  the  dupilumab  group,  2  of  the  5  participants  with  severe  events  experienced  an  SAE  (see 
following section): 
•  papillary thyroid cancer (1 participant) 
•  uterine leiomyoma, pyelonephritis acute, and pelvic inflammatory disease (1 participant) 
The remaining 3 events within the dupilumab group were non-serious, none required permanent IMP 
discontinuation.  
• 
• 
episodes of severe headache that recovered without corrective treatment (2 participants) 
severe neurodermatitis that resolved upon corrective treatment and was assessed by the 
Investigator as not related to the IMP (1 participant) 
Serious adverse events 
Treatment-emergent SAEs were reported by 7 (4.6%) participants in the dupilumab group and 12 
(7.6%) participants in the placebo group. All treatment-emergent SAEs were reported by single 
participants only, with the exception of acute myocardial infarction, which was reported by 2 (1.3%) 
participants in the placebo group (0 participants in the dupilumab group).

In the dupilumab group, 7 participants experienced a SAEs. None of the treatment-emergent SAEs 
were considered related to the IMP by the Investigator or led to permanent IMP discontinuation: 
1.  One participant reported 3 SAEs (uterine leiomyoma [between Day 37 and Day 67 ie, 8 to 38 
days after the 4th IMP dose], pyelonephritis acute [6 days after the 5th IMP dose], and pelvic 
inflammatory disease [7 days after the 8th IMP dose]; all of severe intensity). The participant 
developed pyelonephritis acute that resolved upon corrective treatment with levofloxacin. No 
action was taken with the IMP. During workup of the acute pyelonephritis, a CT scan was 
performed which showed a pelvic mass and abdominal ultrasound showed bilateral hydronephrosis. 
This pelvic mass was removed by total hysterectomy and pathology confirmed uterine leiomyoma. 
Post-surgery, the patient developed an infection and pelvic inflammatory disease which resolved 
after corrective treatment with antibiotics.  None of the 3 SAEs were considered related to IMP by 
the Investigator or led to permanent IMP discontinuation.  
2.  One participant with a prior history of allergy reported an SAE of asthma 1 day after the 5th IMP 
injection. The event was likely triggered by first intake of celecoxib (COX-2 selective non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drug), prescribed for osteoporosis. Causality was assessed by the Investigator 
as not related to the IMP. 
3.  One participant experienced an SAE of interstitial lung disease which occurred on Day 4, 3 days 
after the 2nd IMP dose. Corrective treatment and mechanical ventilation as described in the 
Assessment report

participant narrative were started and the participant was recovering at the time of the study data 
cut-off.  
4.  One participant developed papillary thyroid cancer. This participant had a medical history of 
benign thyroid nodule before study entry. During the study, at Day 64, a head and neck ultrasound 
had shown nodules and at Day 151 (10 days after the 12th IMP dose), a biopsy confirmed the 
diagnosis of papillary thyroid cancer. The event did not lead to permanent study intervention 
discontinuation and was considered not related to the IMP by the Investigator. No corrective 
treatment was administered, and the event had not resolved as of the time of the study data cut-
off.  
5.  One Participant experienced an SAE of moderate musculoskeletal chest pain on Day 120, 7 
days after the 10th IMP dose. Workup for a myocardial infarction was negative. The event was 
considered not related to IMP by the Investigator and did not lead to permanent study intervention 
discontinuation. The event had resolved with anti-inflammatory corrective treatment as of the time 
of the study data cut-off. 
6.  One participant reported an SAE of moderate COVID-19 pneumonia on Day 48 (5 days after the 
5th ,IMP dose) which required corrective treatment as described in the participant narrative and 
resolved within 6 days.  
7.  One Participant experienced an SAE of moderate lipoma on Day 162 (7 days after the 13th IMP 
dose). This event qualified as an SAE due to the participant being hospitalized for the surgery. The 
event did not lead to permanent study intervention discontinuation and was considered not related 
to the IMP by the Investigator. The participant recovered upon administration of corrective 
treatment. 
In the placebo group, 12 participants experienced a total of 15 treatment-emergent SAEs. Three 
participants reported more than 1 treatment-emergent SAE: 1) Sepsis and mesenteritis (not 
resolved) 2) Duodenal ulcer perforation and inflammatory bowel disease 3) Cutaneous T-cell 
lymphoma (not resolved) and large granular lymphocytosis (not resolved). Except the events of 
sepsis and mesenteritis, all other treatment-emergent SAEs in the placebo group were considered by 
the Investigator as not related to IMP. Administration of IMP was permanently discontinued in 
2 participants: 1) duodenal ulcer perforation and 2) Hodgkin’s disease (not resolved). Six 
treatment-emergent SAEs were not resolved as indicated above. For the SAE of and inflammatory 
bowel disease corrective treatment was started. 
Deaths 
Main safety population (Study EFC16460 & EFC16459) 
No deaths were reported.  
Supportive safety population 
17 new deaths were reported in ongoing studies in other dupilumab indications. All fatal events were 
assessed as non-related to the IMP by the Investigator. The majority of the events leading to death 
(13/17) were reported in participants with moderate to severe COPD enrolled in EFC15804 and 
EFC15805 studies. 
Adverse events of special interest and other selected adverse event groupings 
Adverse events of special interest and other selected AE groupings were searched in the database 
using predefined search criteria as listed below. In addition a medical review was conducted for specific 
AESIs.

(N=157) 
Anaphylactic reactions / systemic hypersensitivity  (AESI) 
No anaphylactic reactions were reported in the pooled safety population (Table 19 alt). Systemic 
hypersensitivity reactions (medically reviewed) were reported in 1 (0.7%) participant in the dupilumab 
group and 2 (1.3%) participants in the placebo group. None of the events were severe or serious nor 
did any event have multi-organ involvement. All events affected only the skin. All 3 participants were 
ADA-negative. 
The dupilumab-treated participant who experienced an event of mild dermatitis allergic 12 days after 
the 12th IMP dose had a medical history of active mild AD. The symptoms were localized to facial and 
hand areas with no systemic symptoms reported. The IMP was continued unchanged and the 
participant recovered after receiving corrective treatment. The event was assessed by the Investigator 
as not related. 
Hypersensitivity reactions reported in placebo participants were two events of urticaria. The first event 
was of mild intensity and reported as generalized urticaria. The event occurred 4 days after the 6th 
IMP dose, and involved the lower legs, arms and abdomen. No abnormal laboratory results or systemic 
symptoms were reported at the time of the event. The event was assessed as related to the IMP by 
the Investigator and led to permanent study intervention discontinuation. No corrective treatment was 
administered and the participant recovered. The second urticaria event was of moderate severity and 
reported on trunk and arms 11 days after the 3rd IMP dose. No permanent study intervention 
discontinuation was required and the event resolved after corrective treatment. 
Injection site reactions (other selected AE groupings) 
In the safety pool, events identified by high level term injection site reactions were reported in 6 
(3.9%) participants in the dupilumab group and 9 (5.7%) participants in the placebo group. Of these, 
10 participants (3 in the dupilumab group and 7 in the placebo group) only had 1 TEAE of injection site 
reaction during the study (of which 3 participants at Day 1). In both intervention groups, the incidence 
of events decreased over time.  
No injection site reactions meeting the criteria of serious, or severe that lasted longer than 24 hours 
were reported in the pooled safety population. 
Infections 
Severe or serious infection (other selected AE groupings)  
The incidence of severe or serious infections was low in both intervention groups (dupilumab: 2 
[1.3%]; placebo: 3 [1.9%]). Most events (5/6) were unrelated, with one related event in the placebo 
group; none of the events led to permanent intervention discontinuation.  
In  the  2  dupilumab-treated  participants,  reported  infections  were  all  SAEs  (see  previous  section 
above):  
severe pyelonephritis acute and severe pelvic inflammatory. 
• 
•  moderate COVID-19 pneumonia lasting 6 days. 
For both participants, events were assessed as unrelated to IMP and resolved upon administration of 
corrective medications. 
Assessment report  
EMA/9410/2023  
Page 111/141 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In  placebo-treated  participants,  2  serious  and  1  nonserious  events  were  reported,  all  of  severe 
intensity.  
•  SAE of COVID-19 (assessed as unrelated to the IMP; resolved with sequelae). 
•  SAE of sepsis (assessed as related to the IMP; the participant had not recovered from the event 
as of the study cut-off date). 
•  Non-serious  event  of  severe  cellulitis  (assessed  as  unrelated  to  the  IMP;  resolved  without 
sequelae after corrective treatment with oral antibiotics). 
Severe conjunctivitis (AESI) and conjunctivitis events (other selected AE groupings)  
No cases of severe conjunctivitis were reported for the pooled safety population.  
The proportion of participants who experienced TEAEs of non-severe conjunctivitis based on the 
broad/narrow CMQs and conjunctivitis FDA cluster criteria was higher in the dupilumab group 
compared with the placebo group: 8 (5.3%) versus 3 (1.9%) participants using the broad CMQ, and 6 
(3.9%) versus 2 (1.3%) participants using either the narrow CMQ or the conjunctivitis FDA cluster. 
The events captured only in the broad CMQ were foreign body sensation in eyes, conjunctival 
hyperaemia, and eye pruritus.  
None of the events (broad CMQ) were serious or led to permanent study intervention discontinuation. 
Except 1 event of conjunctivitis allergic in a dupilumab-treated participant that was reported as 
resolving with corrective medication after 5 months from event onset all other events were resolved as 
of the cut-off date of the studies. Three events of conjunctivitis allergic and 1 event of conjunctivitis 
reported in the dupilumab group and 1 event (eye pruritus) in the placebo group were assessed as 
related to the IMP.

group (14 [8.9%] participants). Two participants in the dupilumab group and 1 participant in the 
placebo group had past or current history of AD. None of the reported events were serious or led to 
permanent intervention discontinuation. The only severe infection was cellulitis, a nonserious event 
reported in a placebo-treated participant that was considered as unrelated to the IMP and resolved 
without sequelae upon corrective therapy. 
The most frequently reported PT pertaining to skin infections was folliculitis (1 [0.7%] versus 4 [2.5%] 
in the dupilumab and placebo groups, respectively), followed by cellulitis (1 [0.7%] versus 2 [1.3%]), 
and dermatitis infected and postoperative wound infection (both reported in 0 participants in the 
dupilumab group versus 2 [1.3%] participants in the placebo group). Two participants in the 
dupilumab group and 5 participants in the placebo group had multiple skin infections. Of the total 
number of participants reporting skin infections, 12 were treated with systemic antibiotics (4 in the 
dupilumab group and 8 in the placebo group) and 1 placebo participant was treated with systemic 
antifungals for a fungal skin infection. 
Herpes infections 
In the safety pool, 5 (3.3%) participants in the dupilumab group and 0 participants in the placebo 
group experienced events within the herpes viral infections HLT. The 5 cases in the dupilumab group 
include PTs of genital herpes simplex, herpes zoster, ophthalmic herpes zoster (reported by 1 
participant each), and oral herpes (reported by 2 participants).  
None of the events were serious and all were of moderate intensity, except for the event of herpes 
zoster which was of mild intensity. Both events of oral herpes were considered related to IMP by the 
Investigator and occurred in participants with a medical history of herpes infections. None of the 
events required permanent IMP discontinuation.  
All participants had recovered with corrective treatment after a duration of 6 to 11 days, except for the 
participant with the event of ophthalmic herpes zoster (which occurred approximately 3 months after 
the 13th IMP dose) who had recovered after a duration of 36 days. The participant who experienced the 
event of genital herpes simplex (11 days after the 9th IMP dose) had a medical history of genital 
herpes and AD. None of the other participants with TEAEs of herpes infection had a past or current 
medical history of AD. The participant who experienced an event of herpes zoster (on the day of the 
9th IMP dose) had no medical history of herpes infections. Among PN participants there were no 
reported cases of eczema herpeticum. 
Helminthic infection (AESI)  
No treatment-emergent helminthic infections were reported in the pooled safety population. 
Malignancy 
Malignancy (other selected AE groupings)  
In the safety pool, a total of 3 malignancies were reported; 1 (0.7%) and 2 (1.3%) participants in the 
dupilumab and placebo groups, respectively. All events were reported as SAE and are also described in 
the respective paragraphs above. None of the events were assessed by the Investigator as related to 
the IMP.   
1.  In the dupilumab group, an SAE of papillary thyroid cancer was reported in a participant with a 
history of thyroid nodule. The event did not lead to permanent intervention discontinuation and 
had not resolved as of the time of the study data cut-off.  
Assessment report  
EMA/9410/2023  
Page 115/141 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  In the placebo group, a participant developed an SAE of Hodgkin's disease, which required IMP 
discontinuation and administration of corrective treatment. As of the cut-off date of the study the 
participant had not recovered.  
3.  The second placebo-treated participant developed malignancies reported cutaneous T-cell 
lymphoma and large granular lymphocytosis. 
Other events 
Significant ALT elevation (AESI) and potential drug-related hepatic disorder (other selected 
AE groupings)  
No cases of significant ALT elevation (ALT >5 x ULN in participants with baseline ALT ≤2 x ULN or ALT 
>8 x ULN if baseline ALT >2 x ULN) (AESI) were reported in the safety pooled population. There were 
no cases meeting Hy’s law criteria (ALT >3 × ULN and total bilirubin >2 × ULN). 
Three (1.9%) participants in the placebo group reported potential drug related hepatic disorder while 
non was observed in the dupilumab group. All 3 placebo-treated participants reported an increase in 
hepatic enzymes (i.e. alanine aminotransferase increased and gamma-glutamyltransferase). All three 
events were nonserious and of mild or moderate intensity, none led to permanent intervention 
discontinuation or were assessed as related to the IMP by the Investigator. ALT levels returned back to 
normal for both participants. As of the cut-off dates of the studies the reported outcomes for the 2 
events of ALT increase were ‘resolving’ and ‘resolved’, respectively; for the GGT increase the reported 
outcome was ‘not resolved’, noting that the participant refused to have laboratory tests rechecked. No 
trigger factors were reported for these events in any of the participants.  
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (SOC)  
TEAEs in the SOC Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders were more frequently reported in 
the dupilumab group as compared to the placebo group (15 [9.9%] versus 7 [4.5%] participants). Of 
note, a higher number of participants (5 [3.3%]) experienced TEAEs within the Joint disorders HLGT in 
the dupilumab group as compared to placebo (1 [0.6%]) participants. PTs under the Joint disorders 
HLGT were of a single occurrence except for arthralgia, which was reported in 2 (1.3%) participants in 
the dupilumab group versus 0 participants in the placebo group.  
For 18 out of the 22 participants, events of Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders were 
considered not related to IMP by the Investigator. Of the 4 related events, 2 were reported in 
dupilumab-treated participants (arthralgia and joint stiffness) and 2 in placebo (back pain and 
myalgia). Both events of arthralgia were nonserious and mild, and none led to permanent study 
intervention discontinuation. The event considered related to IMP by the Investigator occurred in a 
participant with history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and no history of joint pain or atopic disease. No 
corrective treatment was started and the event had not recovered as of the time of the study data cut-
off. This participant also reported TEAEs of myalgia and sciatica, both not resolved by the study data 
cut-off. The Investigator assessed myalgia and arthralgia as related, and sciatica as not related.

Cardiovascular events  
Serious TEAEs in the Cardiac disorders SOC, Nervous system disorders SOC, and Vascular disorders 
SOC, or with a PT of pulmonary embolism, and any event with an outcome of death, regardless of 
cause or timing, were reviewed. Cardiovascular thromboembolic events (cardiovascular deaths, non-
fatal myocardial infarctions, and non-fatal strokes) were reported in 0 participants in the dupilumab 
group and 2 (1.3%) participants in the placebo group (SAEs of acute myocardial infarction for both 
cases). 
Clinically symptomatic eosinophilia (AESI)  
No clinically symptomatic eosinophilia events were reported in the safety pooled population. 
Pregnancy and partner pregnancy (AESI)  
No pregnancies or partner pregnancies were reported in the safety pool. 
Suicidal behavior (other selected AE groupings)  
No events of suicidal behavior were reported in the safety pool. 
Adverse drug reactions 
The primary assessment for ADRs was conducted on the pooled safety population, comprised of all 
participants in the 2 pivotal studies EFC16460 and EFC16459 who received at least one dose of study 
intervention (N=309). The analysis was based on individual PTs. 
The qualification of a TEAE PT as an ADR is based on the following quantitative and qualitative criteria: 
Quantitative Criteria: The PTs with incidence ≥2% in the dupilumab group, a difference of ≥1% versus 
the placebo group, and with the lower bound of the 95% CI of relative risk >1 compared to placebo.  
Qualitative Criteria: Medical judgement was applied to confirm the PTs which met quantitative criteria 
as ADRs. The seriousness, severity, outcome of the TEAE and impact on IMP administered were also 
considered. 
Selected AEs/AE grouping which have been previously established as ADRs for other approved 
indications (AD and/or asthma and/or CRSwNP) were assessed for a numerical imbalance between 
groups. None of the PTs met the quantitative ADR criteria (≥2% incidence with ≥1% difference and 
lower bound of the 95% CI of relative risk >1).

Q2W group and difference ≥1% versus placebo group - Pooled safety population 
Confidence intervals are Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel stratified by study 
Amongst ADRs observed in dupilumab-treated participants in the AD and/or asthma and/or CRSwNP 
programs, PTs of conjunctivitis and conjunctivitis allergic evaluated from the perspective of the FDA 
conjunctivitis cluster and the narrow CMQ were considered as ADRs for PN based on an imbalance 
between dupilumab and placebo in the PN safety pool, and in the absence of an alternative etiology. All 
other AEs/AE groupings identified as ADRs for previous indications were not observed in the PN safety 
pool or were reported with a higher incidence in the placebo group, or were observed in a low number 
of dupilumab-treated participants in PN studies and therefore not considered to be ADRs for the PN 
program.  
In summary, ADRs identified for the PN indication are PTs of conjunctivitis and conjunctivitis allergic. 
Laboratory findings 
Hematology 
Red blood cells, platelets and coagulation  
No relevant changes from baseline mean values were observed over time for the hematology 
parameters hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBCs, platelets in the dupilumab and placebo groups. 
The overall number of participants with potentially clinically significant abnormalites for RBC, platelets 
or coagulation during the TEAE period (regardless of baseline values) was low and similar across 
intervention groups, except for PCSA of increased hematocrit (≥0.55 v/v [male]; ≥0.5 v/v [female]) 
which was less frequently reported in the dupilumab group compared to the placebo group (6.6% 
versus 15.0%, respectively).  
No participants had PCSAs related to RBC, platelets or coagulation that were considered SAEs or were 
TEAEs that led to permanent intervention discontinuation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/9410/2023

White blood cells 
No relevant mean changes from baseline were observed over time for white blood cell parameters 
(WBC count, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils and eosinophils). 
The overall number of participants with PCSAs for WBC parameters (regardless of baseline values) 
during the TEAE period was generally balanced across intervention groups, with the exception of 
increased basophils >0.1 x 109/L, reported with a higher incidence in the dupilumab group as 
compared to the placebo group (10.6% versus 5.9% participants). The highest on-treatment mean 
increase in basophils from baseline was 0.015 x 109/L in the dupilumab group. The most frequently 
reported PCSA in either intervention group was for increased monocytes >0.7 x 109/L (21.9% in the 
dupilumab group and 24.2% in the placebo group.  
No participants had PCSAs related to changes in WBC parameters that were serious TEAEs or were 
TEAEs that led to permanent intervention discontinuation. One participant in the placebo group 
reported an SAE of large granular lymphocytosis; this participant had a reported PCSA for low WBCs 
during the study intervention period.

TE: Treatment emergent, PCSA: Potentially clinically significant abnormality 
The number (n) represents the subset of the total number of participants who met the criterion in question at least once during the 
TE period. 
The denominator (/N1) for each parameter within a intervention group is the number of participants for the intervention group who 
had that parameter assessed during the TE period 
For PCSA including condition based only on change from baseline, the denominator is restricted to participants having a baseline 
and at least one post-baseline value during the TE period 
Special Assessment of blood eosinophils  
In the safety pooled population, mean (SD) blood eosinophil counts at baseline were 0.318 (0.340) x 
109/L and 0.259 (0.202) x 109/L in the dupilumab and the placebo groups, respectively. No significant 
changes in the mean blood eosinophil values were observed in either groups over the intervention 
period. A minimal transient increase from baseline in blood eosinophils was observed at Week 8 in both 
the dupilumab and placebo groups (mean change from baseline + 0.02 x 109/L and + 0.03 x 109/L,

respectively). A slight decrease in mean and median eosinophil count from baseline to Week 24 was 
observed in the dupilumab group (‑0.058 x 109/L and -0.040 x 109/L, respectively).  
A lower incidence was observed in the dupilumab group (5.7%) compared to the placebo group (9.4%) 
for increased eosinophils >0.5 x 109/L or >ULN (if ULN ≥0.5 x 109/L) in participants with 
normal/missing values. Similar percentages were reported for the total number of participants of the 
overall safety pool population, regardless of baseline values. 
Post-baseline blood eosinophil count ≥5 x 109/L was reported in 1 (0.7%) participant in the dupilumab 
group versus none in the placebo group. No events of clinically symptomatic eosinophilia were 
reported. The 1 participant in the dupilumab group with eosinophil count ≥5 x 109/L was observed with 
a post‑baseline peak blood eosinophil count of 6.01 x 109/L on Day 62 (Week 8); this event was not 
reported as a TEAE. The value returned to normal at the next unscheduled visit on Day 70 (0.12 x 
109/L), was still slightly elevated at EOT visit (1.06 x 109/L) and was within normal levels at end of 
study visit. This participant did not have history of atopic conditions and had normal eosinophil counts 
at screening. This participant also reported TEAEs of pharyngitis and headache (3 episodes, 2 of which 
occurred around the time of eosinophil elevation); these events were not considered related.

Clinical Chemistry  
Metabolic parameters 
No relevant mean changes from baseline were observed over time for metabolic parameters 
(cholesterol, total protein, and creatine phosphokinase) in the dupilumab and placebo groups in the 
safety pool. 
Assessment report  
EMA/9410/2023  
Page 120/141 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The proportion of participants with PCSAs for metabolic parameters (regardless of baseline values) 
during the TEAE period was similar between the 2 intervention groups, with the exception of increased 
glucose ≥200 mg/dL (unfasted) or ≥126 mg/dL (fasted), reported with a higher incidence in the 
dupilumab group as compared to the placebo group (4.6% versus 1.9% participants). All of these 
participants except 1 in the placebo group were diabetic or had diabetes during the study. 
The most frequently reported PCSA was for decreased glucose ≤70 mg/dL and LLN, which had a similar 
incidence between intervention groups (7.9% in the dupilumab group and 7.1% in the placebo group). 
No participants had PCSAs related to changes in metabolic parameters that were serious TEAEs or 
were TEAEs that led to permanent intervention discontinuation in the safety pool.  
An imbalance at PT level was observed for participants with TEAEs of blood creatine phosphokinase 
increased (dupilumab: 3.3%; placebo: 0.6%). The incidence of participants with PCSAs were similar 
between intervention groups both for increased CPK >3 ULN (3.3% and 4.5% in dupilumab and 
placebo participants, respectively) and increased CPK >10 ULN (0.7% versus 1.3%). None of the 
events reported in the dupilumab group were severe, serious, or led to permanent IMP discontinuation. 
For 1 participant in the dupilumab group an increase of >10 x ULN in CPK levels was seen at Week 24 
(EOT visit). This increase was not reported as an adverse event and CPK values returned to normal 
within one week.  
Electrolytes  
No relevant mean changes from baseline in electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride or bicarbonate) 
were observed in the dupilumab and placebo groups in the safety pool. 
The number of participants with PCSAs was overall low and balanced across intervention groups for all 
electrolyte parameters (regardless of baseline values) during the TEAE period. The most frequently 
reported PCSA was decreased sodium, reported with a lower percentage in the dupilumab group 
compared to the placebo group (0% and 1.9%, respectively). 
No participants had PCSAs related to changes in electrolytes that were serious TEAEs or were TEAEs 
that led to permanent intervention discontinuation in either group of the safety pool. 
Renal function  
No relevant mean changes from baseline were observed for renal function parameters (creatinine, 
creatinine clearance, uric acid, and blood urea nitrogen) across dupilumab and placebo groups in the 
safety pool. 
The proportion of participants with PCSAs for renal function parameters (regardless of baseline values) 
was generally comparable between intervention groups during the TEAE period except for PCSAs for 
creatinine clearance ≥30 - <60 mL/min (moderate decrease in GFR), which were reported with a 
higher incidence in the dupilumab group as compared to the placebo group (22.2% versus 8.3%, 
respectively) among the participants with baseline creatinine clearance ≥60 - <90 mL/min (mild 
decrease in GFR).  
In addition, 1 participant in the placebo group with a PCSA for decreased creatinine clearance <15 
mL/min (end stage renal disease) on Day 57 (9 mL/min) reported a nonserious TEAE of mild blood 
creatinine increase on the same day. The event did not lead to treatment intervention discontinuation 
and was considered not related to the IMP by the Investigator. The event resolved on Day 63 without 
corrective treatment, with creatinine clearance of 221 mL/min and all the other renal function 
parameters demonstrating normal values. 
No participants had PCSAs for abnormalities in renal function parameters that were considered serious 
TEAEs or were TEAEs that led to permanent intervention discontinuation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/9410/2023  
Page 121/141 
 
 
 
 
The most frequently reported PCSA in both intervention groups was increased uric acid >6.86 mg/dL, 
with a similar incidence in the dupilumab and placebo groups (25.7% and 27.3%, respectively). 
Liver function  
No relevant mean changes from baseline were observed for liver function parameters (ALT, AST, ALP, 
total bilirubin, and albumin) in the dupilumab and placebo intervention groups during the intervention 
period in the safety pool, except for LDH. 
A decrease from baseline in mean LDH was observed in the dupilumab group over time up to Week 12 
(mean [SD] change from baseline: -0.094 [0.134] x ULN), and was sustained up to Week 24 (mean 
[SD] change from baseline: -0.089 [0.137] x ULN). Mean (SD) change from baseline to last on-
treatment assessment was -0.087 [0.134] x ULN. Mean LDH values remained relatively unchanged in 
the placebo group throughout the study. 
The number of participants with PCSAs for liver function parameters was low and similar between 
intervention groups regardless of their baseline PCSA status. No participants experienced a PCSA that 
met the Hy’s law criteria (ALT >3 x ULN and total bilirubin >2 x ULN).  
No participants had PCSAs for abnormalities in liver function parameters that were considered serious 
TEAEs or were TEAEs that led to permanent intervention discontinuation.  
No participants reported PCSAs that met AESI criteria for significant ALT elevation; 3 participants, all in 
the placebo group, reported PCSAs that met other selected AE groupings criteria for drug-related 
potential hepatic disorders.  
Urinalysis  
The percentage of participants with positive results for urine protein in the dipstick urinalysis was 
generally similar between intervention groups during the 24-week intervention period, except at Week 
8 (7.7% participants in the dupilumab group versus 12.9% participants in the placebo group).  
Vital signs 
Blood pressure and orthostatic changes 
No relevant mean changes from baseline were observed over time for vital sign parameters (SBP, DBP, 
HR, respiratory rate, body temperature and weight) across intervention groups in the safety pool. 
The proportion of participants with PCSAs for SBP or HR was generally low and balanced between the 
intervention groups. For diastolic blood pressure (≥110 mmHg and increase from baseline ≥10 mmHg) 
and weight (≥5% decrease from baseline) the incidence of PCSAs was higher in the dupilumab group 
compared with the placebo group (2.6% versus 0.7%, and 10.1% versus 7.9% for the 2 parameters, 
respectively). Among these 5 participants with PCSAs in DBP, 2 in the dupilumab group had history of 
hypertension. No headache or dizziness were reported for any of these patients around the day when 
the vital sign measurement was taken. 
No  participants  had  TEAEs  of  abnormalities  in  vital  signs  that  were  considered  serious  or  that  led  to 
permanent intervention discontinuation. 
Electrocardiogramm 
In studies EFC16460 and EFC16459 ECGs were performed locally and at screening (V1) and Week 24 
(V6). These data were not pooled for safety analysis and were reported separately. 
QTc Fridericia >480 msec was reported at Week 24 in 2/70 (2.9%) participants in the dupilumab group 
versus 0% in the placebo group in EFC16460, and in 1/73 (1.4%) and 2/67 (3.0%) participants in the 
dupilumab and placebo group, respectively, in EFC16459. In EFC16459, 1 placebo-treated participant 
Assessment report  
EMA/9410/2023  
Page 122/141 
 
 
 
 
 
with an active medical condition of hypothyroidism was observed with increased QTcF >500 msec. The 
participant had baseline QTcF of 442 msec and the QTcF at EOT (14 days after the 13th IMP dose) was 
528 msec, with an increase from baseline of 86 msec. 
No participant in either study had TEAEs related to ECG abnormalities that were reported as SAEs or 
TEAEs leading to permanent study intervention discontinuation. 
Immunogenicity 
Incidence and characterization of anti-dupilumab antibodies 
In the dupilumab group, 14 (9.8%) participants were ADA-positive while 5 (3.4%) ADA-positive 
participants were reported in the placebo group. Treatment-emergent ADA responses were observed in 
11 (7.7%) participants in the dupilumab group and 3 (2.0%) in the placebo group. Of the total number 
of participants with treatment-emergent ADA responses, 2 (1.4%) in the dupilumab group versus none 
in the placebo group developed persistent responses. No participants had a treatment boosted ADA 
response. The majority of ADA-positive participants (8 [5.6%] participants in the dupilumab group and 
3 [2.0%] in the placebo group) had low (<1000) ADA titer responses, with 3 (2.1%) dupilumab-
treated participants versus none in the placebo group who exhibited moderate titer response (1000-
10.000). There were no participants with high titer (>1000) responses. Positive NAb responses were 
observed in 4 (2.8%) participants in the dupilumab group and 2 (1.4%) participants in the placebo 
group. Among the NAb positive participants, 3 participants in the dupilumab group exhibited moderate 
titer ADA responses while the remaining participant had a low titer response.  
Further details on ADA responses with regard to clinical pharmacodynamics and clinical efficacy can 
also be found in Section 2.4.2 and 2.5.2. 
Association of anti-dupilumab antibodies to adverse events 
In participants with treatment-emergent ADA, the proportion of those who had at least 1 TEAE was 
similar across intervention groups (63.6% in the dupilumab group and 66.7% in the placebo group). 
Among ADA-negative participants, a higher percentage of dupilumab-treated participants compared to 
placebo-participants reported TEAEs (64.4% versus 56.3). In treatment-emergent ADA positive 
participants, there was 1 SAE reported in a dupilumab participant (interstitial lung disease), occurring 
prior to testing positive for ADA) and no TEAEs leading to permanent intervention discontinuation. The 
SOCs with the most frequently reported events in the ADA-positive population were similar to those 
observed in the overall pooled safety population, except for Musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders, which showed a numerical imbalance between groups in treatment emergent ADA 
participants (3 [27.3%] participants in the dupilumab group versus none in the placebo group).  
In participants positive for NAb, 1 participant in each group experienced TEAEs: uterine leiomyoma and 
urticaria were reported in the same participant in the dupilumab group and headache was reported in 1 
participant in the placebo group. The TEAE of urticaria was not associated with systemic symptoms and 
occurred after the first identified ADA positive response; the event was considered by the Investigator 
to be related to the IMP although there was a possible exposure to a food allergen as well. 
Overall, the number of ADA-positive and Nab-positive participants is low. ADA formation did not 
appear to have any meaningful impact on the safety of dupilumab. 
Safety in special populations 
The incidence of TEAEs, SAEs, TEAEs leading to permanent intervention discontinuation, and 
AESIs/other selected AE groupings was analysed in subgroups based on the participant’s demographics

and other baseline characteristics (age, gender, race, ethnicity, baseline weight, and baseline BMI) and 
the participant’s PN disease characteristics. 
Demographics and other baseline characteristics 
Incidence of TEAEs were compared between dupilumab and placebo groups across all subgroups based 
on demographics and other baseline characteristics and were comparable with the overall safety 
population.

SAEs, TEAEs leading to permanent intervention discontinuation, and AESIs/other selected 
AE groupings  
The incidence of SAEs was generally similar between dupilumab and placebo groups across all 
subgroups of participants based on demographics and baseline PN characteristics. A lower incidence of 
SAEs was observed in the dupilumab group as compared to the placebo group in the subgroup of 
atopic participants (1.2% versus 11.2%, risk ratio: 0.11 [95% CI: 0.01 to 0.81]). No increased 
incidence of SAEs was observed in the dupilumab group as compared to the placebo group in any 
subgroups by disease characteristics, including those for which a numerical difference in TEAE 
incidence was observed. In the dupilumab group, no meaningful differences were observed in SAE 
incidence between the subgroups of participants under stable regimen of TCS/TCI compared to 
participants that were not treated with TCS/TCI during the study (4.4% and 4.9%, respectively). The 
safety profile of these 2 subgroup categories were consistent with the overall safety pool. No TEAEs 
leading to permanent intervention discontinuation were reported in the dupilumab group. The limited 
number of participants who experienced AESIs/other selected AE groupings across subgroups did not 
allow meaningful interpretation of results.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Adverse events leading to permanent intervention discontinuation 
The incidence of TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation from intervention was low overall, and all 
events occurred in placebo-treated participants (4 [2.5%] participants. All TEAEs were of a single 
occurrence and included 2 nonserious events of neurodermatitis and urticaria (assessed as related 
to the IMP) and 2 serious events of Hodgkin's disease and duodenal ulcer perforation. Three of 
the 4 events resolved; the SAE of Hodgkin's disease had not resolved at the time of the study data 
cut-off and the participant was receiving corrective treatment.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Dupilumab is currently approved for treatment of atopic dermatitis, asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis 
with nasal polyposis. 
The main safety data for this application are derived from pooled data of participants with PN aged 18 
years and older exposed to dupilumab 300mg Q2W (initial loading dose of 600mg) in the two pivotal 
placebo-controlled phase 3 studies EFC16460 and EFC16459 conducted during the PN development 
program. These studies included a 24-week treatment period and a 12-week follow up. No long-term 
safety data were generated within the PN development program. Cut-off dates for the integrated 
safety analysis are 30 August 2021 (EFC16460) and 12 November 2021 (EFC16459).  
Based on the initial safety data submitted for this application the follow-up period remained ongoing 
for 23.6% of the participants (55 in EFC16460 and 18 in EFC16459). Clinical study report addenda 
were provided for both studies including the prior missing safety data from 73 participants that were 
ongoing in the 12-week follow-up period based on a database lock date of 03-Mar-2022 and 20-Dec-
2021, respectively. 
SUSAR and fatal events from other ongoing Phase 1/2/3 studies and Phase 4 interventional studies in 
other indications reported until 20 December 2021 were provided as supportive safety data. 
A total of 309 participants were exposed (152 dupilumab; 157 placebo) within studies EFC16460 and 
EFC16459. Mean exposure for dupilumab and placebo are 166.8 (69.42 py) and 145.9 (62.72 py) 
days, respectively. Almost all patients within the dupilumab group (98.0%) completed the 24-week 
treatment period while 26.1% discontinued study intervention in the placebo group, mostly due to lack 
of efficacy (either by investigator’s decision or as reason for withdrawal) as a consequence of the 
observed treatment effect within the dupilumab group. 
A slightly higher incidence of TAES occurred in the dupilumab group as compared to placebo (63.8% 
vs. 56.7%). The most frequent TEAEs by SOC were infections and infestations (dupilumab: 24.3%; 
placebo: 23.6%) and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (dupilumab: 16.4%; placebo: 14.6%). 
Apparent imbalances between TEAS by SOCs are observed for the SOCs musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders (dupilumab: 15 [9.9%]; placebo: 7 [4.5%]) and gastrointestinal disorders 
(dupilumab: 14 [9.2%]; placebo: 8 [5.1%]) and for blood creatine phosphokinase increased 
(dupilumab: 5 [3.3%]; placebo: 1 [0.6]). 
Frequent (≥1%) TEAEs in the dupilumab group were nasopharyngitis, dizziness, diarrhoea, eczema, 
blood creatine phosphokinase increased, conjunctivitis and conjunctivitis allergic, myalgia, and 
accidental overdose. In contrast, COVID-19, neurodermatitis, injection site pain and folliculitis 
appeared less frequent (≤1%) as compared to placebo. 
Treatment-emergent SAEs were reported by 7 (4.6%) participants in the dupilumab group and 12 
(7.6%) participants in the placebo group. All SAEs in the dupilumab group were assessed as not 
related to dupilumab which is considered acceptable.  
No deaths were reported within studies EFC16460 and EFC16459 as of the cut-off date. 17 deaths are 
reported in participants with other indications that were all assessed as non-related to the IMP. 
Overall, no indications for new safety signal emerge from the reported SUSARs or fatal events. 
Adverse events of special interest and other selected AEs of interest including anaphylactic reactions, 
hypersensitivity and different infections (e.g. conjunctivitis, blepharitis, keratitis, herpes) were further 
evaluated. Number of treatment emergent adverse events of special interest were generally low and 
included only a total of 3 events of systemic hypersensitivity reactions (dupilumab: 1; placebo: 2). No 
anaphylactic events were reported. The overall incidence of other selected AEs of interest was similar 
Assessment report  
EMA/9410/2023  
Page 128/141 
 
 
 
 
between the groups (dupilumab: 16 [10.5%], placebo: 18 [11.5%]). The occurrence of conjunctivitis 
(either defined by narrow, broad or FDA criteria) were increased in the dupilumab group (broad: 8 vs. 
3; narrow: 6 vs. 2; FDA: 6 vs. 2). None of the events were serious or led to study discontinuation and 
two moderate cases are reported in the dupilumab group. All cases resolved except for one participant 
as of the cut-off dates of the safety analysis, the event was reported as resolved 6 months after event 
onset. No events of severe blepharitis or keratitis were reported. 
In the absence of an alternative aetiology, the PTs of conjunctivitis and conjunctivitis allergic are 
considered by the MAH as ADRs for the indication of PN and section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated 
which is acceptable. 
Injection site reactions were reported in 6 (3.9%) and 9 (5.7%) participants in the dupilumab and 
placebo group, respectively. All ISR were of short duration and all recovered without corrective 
treatment and without sequelae. 
The number of severe or serious infections was low (dupilumab: 2; placebo: 3). None of the events led 
to permanent study intervention discontinuation. Section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated with this 
information for the PN indication. Nine (9) events of COVID-19 were reported with a higher incidence 
in the placebo group (dupilumab: 2; placebo: 7). Out of the 9 events, one event was severe and two 
events were serious. None of the events were assessed as related to the IMP or led to permanent 
study intervention discontinuation.  
A higher number of herpes infection were observed in dupilumab-treated (5 vs. 0). All events were of 
moderate or of mild intensity. Two events of oral herpes were assessed as related to dupilumab. All 
participants recovered after treatment within 6-36 days. Contrary to the higher incidence of herpes 
infections in the dupilumab group other skin infections were increased in patients treated with placebo 
(14 [8.9%]) as compared to dupilumab (7 [4.6%]) with folliculitis and cellulitis being the most 
frequent.  
The effect of treatment on blood eosinophils was overall small. A minimal increase was observed within 
the first 8 weeks for the dupilumab and the placebo group while eosinophil counts were slightly 
decreased in the dupilumab group at week 24 and week 36 as compared to baseline while no relevant 
change was observed within the placebo group. Increased eosinophils were observed in 17 (11.3%) 
and 16 (10.5%) of participants in the dupilumab and placebo group. No event of clinically symptomatic 
eosinophilia was reported.  
There is an imbalance of TEAEs within the SOC musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders 
(dupilumab: 15 [9.9%]; placebo: 7 [4.5%]) while no clear increase for one specific PT can be 
observed. Events of myalgia, arthralgia and back pain are reported >1 whereas all other PTs were of 
single occurrence. There was one SAE (musculoskeletal chest pain), that was unrelated to the IMP.  
TEAEs within the SOC gastrointestinal disorders where also reported more frequently as compared to 
placebo (dupilumab: 14 [9.2%]; placebo: 8 [5.1%]). This increase appears to be mainly driven by the 
PT of diarrhoea and no serious event occurred in the dupilumab group. 
No cardiovascular thromboembolic events (cardiovascular deaths, non-fatal myocardial infarctions, and 
non-fatal strokes) were reported in the dupilumab group while 2 SAEs of acute myocardial infarction 
were observed in for placebo group. A total of 3 participants (dupilumab: 1; placebo 2) reported 
malignancies. All were assessed as non-related to the IMP which is endorsed.  
Treatment-emergent ADAs were observed in 11 (7.7%) and 3 (2.0%) participants in the dupilumab 
and placebo group, respectively. The number of ADA-positive participants is comparable with the 
incidence of ADAs in the approved indications AD, asthma and CRSwNP. Most ADAs were low titer. 
Assessment report  
EMA/9410/2023  
Page 129/141 
 
 
 
 
nAbs were observed in 4 participants in the dupilumab group. Overall, no apparent safety signal can be 
observed regarding ADA-formation in participants treated with PN. 
Subgroup analysis did not give rise to an apparent increased risk for the incidence of TEAEs, SAEs, 
AESIs and other selected AE groupings related to participant’s demographics or disease baseline 
characteristics. 
The safety data from the age group ≥65 years and particularly ≥75 years (8 subjects exposed in the 
dupilumab group) was limited and long-term data in PN were lacking. Considering that patients with 
PN tend to be elderly, more data were requested to the MAH. In response, the MAH provided pooled 
data on dupilumab exposure and safety data from patients ≥65 years and ≥75 years from studies in 
the other indications AD, asthma, CRSwNP and EoE. As of 28 March 2022 (DLP of last DSUR), a total of 
499 subjects over 65 years of age and 75 patients over 75 years of age have been exposed to 
dupilumab, across indications.  No relevant changes in the incidence of TEAEs can be observed in this 
enlarged elderly safety population as compared to the total PN population. This is reflected in Section 
5.2 of the SmPC. 
As of the cut-off dates for the integrated safety analysis the follow-up period remained ongoing for 
23.6% of the participants (55 in EFC16460 and 18 in EFC16459). Additional safety follow-up from 
participants that have completed the 12-week follow-up period after completion of the studies on 22 
November 2021 (EFC16460) and 3 February 2022 (EFC16459) were provided by the MAH in response 
to Request for Supplementary Information. No new safety signals are apparent with this updated 
safety data.  
Overall, based on the provided data, dupilumab appears to have an acceptable safety profile in PN that 
is similar to the other indications AD, asthma and CRSwNP for which dupilumab is already approved. 
No new relevant safety signals were apparent in the observed PN population, and all AEs are 
adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, dupilumab treatment appears to be well tolerated with the proposed dose and method of 
administration (300 mg Q2W SC). The safety profile observed during the PN studies (EFC16460 and 
EFC16459) appears to be consistent with the important identified risks mentioned in the safety 
specification and the so far known safety profile of dupilumab established during the AD, asthma and 
CRSwNP development programs. No new key safety findings are to be reflected in the SmPC and RMP. 
2.6.3.  PSUR cycle

2.8.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.1 of the SmPC have 
been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In addition the MAH took the 
opportunity to clarify in section 4.2 what needs to be done when a dose is missed for the different 
Assessment report

treatment regimens.  
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Excipients guideline, which were 
reviewed and accepted by the CHMP. 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The extension of indication is related to moderate to severe Prurigo nodularis in adult patients, who 
are candidates for systemic therapy. The changes only affected the sections 1, 2 and 3 of the package 
leaflet of Dupixent of the existing strengths/ presentations 300 mg solution for injection in pre-filled 
syringes and Dupixent 300 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen. The instruction for use section 
was not amended. Therefore, neither a full user testing nor a bridging is required due to the fact that 
the changes are minor and the strength is similar to the previous authorised indication with AD. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Prurigo nodularis (PN) is an inflammatory skin disease characterized by the presence of chronic 
pruritus for ≥6 weeks, a history and/or signs of repeated scratching, picking, or rubbing of the skin, 
and the presence of firm nodular lesions which are usually symmetrically distributed on areas of the 
trunk and extremities. Key histological features of PN include hyperkeratosis, irregular epidermal 
hyperplasia with hypergranulosis, dermal/lesional infiltrates of T-lymphocytes, mast cells, and 
eosinophils, and papillary dermal fibrosis. 
Pruritus is the central manifestation in PN and the main driver of disease burden resulting in a 
significant quality of life impairment. In patients with PN, the itching is characteristically intense, 
causing people to scratch themselves and leading to the development of an itch-scratch cycle, which 
exacerbates the cellular damage in skin lesions, facilitates secondary infections and impairs quality of 
life. PN has a significant association with mental disorders such as anxiety and depression and is 
further associated with increased rates of obesity, mental health problems, endocrine, cardiovascular 
and renal disorders, HIV, and malignancy. PN patients have a higher all-cause mortality than patients 
without PN, likely due to the high comorbidity burden. Approximately 20% to 60% of patients have 
either past or current history of atopic dermatitis or other atopic disorders. 
Limited data for the epidemiology of PN exist. A European study found an incidence rate of PN of 111 
per 100 000 person-years. Prurigo nodularis is predominantly observed in older patients but also 
occasionally in younger patients with a median age of >50 years. Both genders are affected with a 
female predominance. Black patients are disproportionately affected with PN compared to Caucasian 
patients.

3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There are no approved systemic therapies available for the treatment of PN and approved treatment 
options for PN are limited to a few specific TCS of which some are authorised nationally in the EU.  
Topical therapies, such as topical corticosteroids (TCS) and topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) are used 
as first-line therapy alone or in combination. Other topical therapies such as Vitamin D3 analogues, 
topical anesthetics, topical capsaicin are also used. Continuous use of emollients as supportive 
antipruritic care is recommended.  Additional therapies used to treat PN include intralesional injections 
of corticosteroids, cryotherapy, and phototherapy. Due to the refractory nature of this disease to 
topical treatment, patients with PN often  require off-label systemic treatment that include 
antihistamines, neuromodulatory agents (gabapentinoids, NKR 1 antagonists, antidepressants or µ-
opioid receptor antagonists) and systemic immunosuppressants (oral corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and 
methotrexate).  
Despite the use of systemic treatments in PN, none of these are currently approved. Overall, the 
currently available effective treatment options for PN are limited and do not always achieve 
satisfactory response in PN patients with severe disease. The therapy of PN remains challenging and of 
prolonged course. Based on the currently available therapies, there is an important unmet need for 
treatment options for patients with PN that are not adequately controlled with the current treatment 
options. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Efficacy and Safety Data are derived from 2 similarly designed pivotal phase 3 studies EFC16460 
(LIBERTY-PN PRIME2) and EFC16459 (LIBERTY-PN PRIME). Both studies were designed as 
multinational, multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group studies, to 
assess the efficacy and safety of 24 week treatment with dupilumab 300 mg Q2W in adult participants 
with PN whose disease was inadequately controlled on topical prescription therapies or when those 
therapies were not advisable. 
Initially, the timing for the primary endpoint in studies EFC16460 and EFC16459 was identical. 
However, after the primary analysis of study EFC16460 (data cut-off: 27-Sept-2021) the still ongoing 
study EFC16459 was amended on 21-Oct-2021 to move the timing of the primary endpoint from week 
12 to week 24 based on the efficacy data observed within study EFC16460. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In both pivotal studies (EFC16460 and EFC 16459) dupilumab 300mg Q2W demonstrated a statistically 
and clinically meaningful improvement in the severity of pruritus (reduction by ≥4 points in the WI-
NRS) as compared to placebo at Week 12 (primary endpoint EFC16460) and Week 24 (primary 
endpoint EFC16459). In both pivotal studies, a statistical significant difference in the reduction of PN 
lesions (participants with IGA PN-S 0 or 1 score at Week 24; key secondary endpoint) was achieved.  
At Week 12, the proportion of participants with a reduction in the WI-NRS by ≥4 from baseline in the 
dupilumab group as compared to placebo was 37.2% vs. 22.0% (p=0.0216) in study EFC16460 and 
44.0% (dupilumab) versus 15.8% (placebo) (p=0.0003) in study EFC16459. At week 24, the 
treatment effect further increased in EFC16460 [57.7% versus 19.5%; p<0.0001; difference: 42.6% 
(95%CI, 29.06-56.08)] and to a similar extent in EFC16459 [60.0% versus 18.4%; p<0.0001; 
difference: 42.7% (95%CI, 27.76-57.72)].   
Assessment report  
EMA/9410/2023  
Page 135/141 
 
 
 
 
Subsequently, in the pooled ITT population a significant difference is observed at Week 12 in the 
dupilumab group (40.5% versus 19.0%; p<0.0001) that was further increased at Week 24 (58.8% 
versus 19.0%; p<0.0001). The treatment effect of dupilumab started to appear within the first weeks 
and further increased over time.  
Mean change and mean percent changes of WI-NRS over time up to Week 24 were both similar and 
overall consistent with the observed reduction in itch severity (WI-NRS reduction of ≥4) points 
showing show a mean reduction of -4.77 and -2.65 and a mean percent change of -53.44 and -27.97 
at Week 24 for dupilumab and placebo respectively. A continuous reduction in WI-NRS is observed to a 
lesser extent in the placebo group. The overall reduction in WI-NRS at Week 24 by 2.2 points in the 
dupilumab group as compared to placebo is supportive for the beneficial treatment effect of dupilumab 
seen for the primary endpoint. 
At Week 24, a slightly lower reduction of PN lesions (participants with IGA PN-S 0 or 1) was observed 
(EFC16460: 15.9% versus 44.9%; EFC16459: 18.4% versus 48.0%) as compared to reduction in 
pruritus severity. The first differences between dupilumab and placebo in WI-NRS and PN-S scores 
started to appear by 4 weeks after baseline. 
Consistent with the observed reduction of itch severity and PN lesions a significant improvement in 
secondary endpoints to evaluate quality of life (e.g. DLQI) was observed at Week 24. Overall, the 
hierarchical testing consisting of 9 steps broke at step 8. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The rather late change in the timing of the primary endpoint in study EFC16459 adds some 
uncertainty. However, it is acknowledged that it was motivated by external data: preliminary efficacy 
findings from study EFC16460, and the overall consistency of the efficacy results between both studies 
provides reassurance regarding the validity of the efficacy data. Adequate clarifications regarding the 
precise timing of the change in the primary endpoint in Study EFC16459 were provided by the MAH. 
Therefore, the CHMP didn’t raise specific concerns with regards to this change. 
Participants taking selected prohibited medications and/or rescue medications prior to week 12 (week 
24 in study EFC16459) were considered as non-responders. A treatment policy estimand would have 
been preferred. Sensitivity analysis addressing a treatment policy estimand, using all observed data 
irrespective of the intercurrent event were provided by the MAH. 
Similarly, participants with missing values were also considered non-responders and in light of higher 
discontinuation rates in the control groups, there was uncertainty whether the dupilumab group might 
have been favoured by this approach. Additional analyses provided by the MAH suggested that results 
are robust. 
Only 6.1% of subjects enrolled in the pivotal studies were Black or African American. Interpretation of 
results observed for this subpopulation is difficult as only a total of 19 patients were enrolled with 11 
patients being treated with dupilumab. The treatment responses seem to principally follow the 
responses observed for the White and Asian participants as well as the overall study population. This 
uncertainty has been adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
Long-term efficacy data are missing as treatment period of studies EFC16459 and EFC16460 was 24 
Weeks. No long-term extension studies were conducted for the new indication of PN and are currently 
not planned by the MAH. Since the MAH didn’t plan to generate further clinical data in the long-term 
use, they have submitted a revised wording to remove the use in long term treatment and added the 
information that no clinical trial data are available for patients treated up to 24 weeks in the SmPC.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety data are derived from pooled data of participants with PN aged 18 years and older exposed 
to dupilumab 300mg Q2W (initial loading dose of 600mg) in the two pivotal placebo-controlled phase 3 
studies EFC16460 and EFC16459 conducted during the PN development program. 
A slightly higher incidence of TAES occurred in the dupilumab group as compared to placebo (63.8% 
vs. 56.7%). The SOCs with the highest proportion of participants with TEAEs in the dupilumab group 
compared to the placebo group were: infections and infestations (24.3% vs. 23.6%), skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders (16.4% vs. 14.6%), nervous system disorders (12.5% vs. 10.2%), 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (9.9% vs. 4.5%), gastrointestinal disorders (9.2% vs. 
5.1%). 
The most frequently reported TEAEs by PT, in the dupilumab group compared to the placebo group, by 
at least 1% were: nasopharyngitis (3.9% vs. 1.9%), dizziness (2.6% vs. 0%), diarrhoea (2.6% vs. 
0.6%), eczema (2.0% vs. 0%), blood creatine phosphokinase increased (3.3% vs. 0.6%), 
conjunctivitis and conjunctivitis allergic (both 2.0% vs. 0.6%), myalgia (2.0% versus 0.6%), 
accidental overdose (5.9% vs. 4.5%) 
Treatment-emergent SAEs were reported by 7 (4.6%) participants in the dupilumab group and 12 
(7.6%) participants in the placebo group. All SAEs in the dupilumab group were assessed as not 
related to dupilumab which is considered acceptable. No deaths were reported within studies 
EFC16460 and EFC16459 as of the cut-off date. 
Adverse events of special interest and other selected AEs groupings were further evaluated. The 
occurrence of conjunctivitis (using the broad CMQ cluster) was increased in the dupilumab group 
(5.3% vs. 1.9%). A higher number of herpes infection were observed in dupilumab-treated (3.3% vs. 
0.0%). All events were of moderate or of mild intensity. Two events of oral herpes were assessed as 
related to dupilumab. All participants recovered after treatment within 6-36 days. Injection site 
reactions were reported in 3.9% vs 5.7% participants in the dupilumab and placebo group, 
respectively. All ISR were of short duration and all recovered without corrective treatment and without 
sequelae. The number of severe or serious infections was low (1.3% vs. 1.9%). None of the events led 
to permanent study intervention discontinuation. 
Subgroup analysis did not give rise to an apparent increased risk for the incidence of TEAEs, SAEs, 
AESIs and other selected AE groupings related to participant’s demographics or disease baseline 
characteristics. 
The association of anti-drug antibodies formation and association to adverse events was analysed. 
Treatment-emergent ADA responses were observed in 7.7% vs. 2.0% of patients in the dupilumab and 
placebo group respectively. The number of ADA-positive participants is comparable with the incidence 
of ADAs in the approved indications AD, asthma and CRSwNP. nAbs were observed in 4 participants in 
the dupilumab group. Overall, no apparent safety signal can be observed regarding ADA-formation in 
participants treated with PN. 
Overall, these are all known risks and no new safety signals were observed in the PN population. The 
CHMP concluded that the overall safety profile observed in patients with PN was generally consistent 
with that observed in patients with AD, asthma and CRSwNP. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety profile for dupilumab has been characterised in previous studies in the AD, asthma, and 
CRSwNP indications. 
Assessment report  
EMA/9410/2023  
Page 137/141 
 
 
 
 
The events of nasopharyngitis were of mild intensity and resolved within 3 to 12 days. None led to 
permanent treatment discontinuation. One event (“common cold”) was considered related to 
dupilumab. Most of the conjunctivitis events were mild. Two moderate cases are reported in the 
dupilumab group (placebo: 0). None of the conjunctivitis events led to study discontinuation. All events 
resolved. Five participants in the dupilumab group versus none in the placebo group with herpes viral 
infections (HLT: genital herpes simplex, herpes zoster, ophthalmic herpes zoster, and oral herpes). 
Most of the events were of moderate intensity, except for the event of herpes zoster which was of mild 
intensity. All participants recovered after treatment within 6-36 days. No clear increase for one specific 
PT can be observed within the SOC musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. The increase in 
the SOC gastrointestinal disorders appears to be mainly driven PT of diarrhea. No serious event 
occurred in the dupilumab group. Injection site reactions were generally of short duration and all 
recovered without corrective treatment and without sequelae. ADA formation did not appear to 
correlate with any safety findings.  
The safety data from the age group ≥65 years and particularly ≥75 years (8 subjects exposed in the 
dupilumab group) is limited and long-term data in PN is lacking. Pooled data on dupilumab exposure 
and safety data from patients ≥65 years and ≥75 years from studies in the other indications AD, 
asthma, CRSwNP and EoE were provided by the MAH. As of 28 March 2022 (DLP of last DSUR), a total 
of 499 subjects over 65 years of age and 75 patients over 75 years of age have been exposed to 
dupilumab, across indications.  No relevant changes in the incidence of TEAEs can be observed in this 
enlarged elderly safety population as compared to the total PN population. 
Safety data for long-term exposure in the new indication at the intended dose (300 mg, Q2W) are 
missing.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The therapy of moderate to severe PN is challenging and of prolonged course. Topical corticosteroids 
(TCS) and topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) are used as first-line therapy alone or in combination. 
Still, a satisfactory control of disease is often not achieved and topical or systemic immunosuppressive 
treatment further harbours significant side effects on long-term use. Thus, an important unmet need 
for new treatment options remains for patients with moderate-to-severe PN that are not adequately 
controlled with topical therapy and that are candidates for systemic treatment.  
Within the pivotal studies EFC16460 and EFC16459, the MAH has demonstrated beneficial treatment 
effects of dupilumab 300 mg Q2W in patients with moderate-to-severe PN by Week 24. The treatment 
effect of dupilumab was consistent between both studies. Statistical significance was reached for the 
primary and key secondary endpoints (reduction in the WI-NRS by ≥4 points; participants reaching IGA 
PN-S 0 or 1) indicating a clinical meaningful improvement in the severity of pruritus and a reduction in 
the number of PN lesions. Both symptoms are most relevant in PN. Consequently, significant reduction 
in health-related quality of life, as measured by DLQI, was observed.  
The main uncertainty relates to long-term efficacy and safety for PN, data beyond 24 week of 
treatment are not available for PN. Based on the similar effect of dupilumab on pruritus reduction in PN 
Assessment report  
EMA/9410/2023  
Page 139/141 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and AD it appears reasonable that the dupilumab 300mg, Q2W is also able to provide long-term 
improvements in chronic PN. However, this has not been demonstrated for this particular indication 
and it is not known whether treatment regimens with lower dupilumab doses may provide an improved 
benefit/risk profile for long-term treatment of PN. Since the MAH didn’t plan to generate further clinical 
data in the long-term use, they have submitted a revised wording to remove the use in long term 
treatment and added the information that clinical trial data are available for patients treated up to 24 
weeks in the SmPC. 
Within studies EFC16460 and EFC16459, dupilumab treatment showed a similar safety profile as within 
the other indications AD, asthma and CRSwNP. The most frequent TEAEs by SOC were infections and 
infestations and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. Nasopharyngitis occurred with a higher 
frequency after dupilumab treatment. None of the events were serious. Conjunctivitis and 
conjunctivitis allergic were identified as ADRs for the indication of PN and showed a similar frequency 
as compared to other indications. A higher occurrence of herpes infection was noted during dupilumab 
treatment. All events were of moderate or mild intensity and all participants recovered after treatment. 
ADA-formation was observed after dupilumab treatment with an overall low incidence while a relevant 
impact on safety and efficacy data was not noted. Occurrence of injection site reactions were low and 
similar between dupilumab and placebo. None of the reported injection site reactions was serious or 
severe. Overall, as compared to other indications no new relevant safety signal is apparent based on 
the current safety data for PN. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Based on the data provided on efficacy and safety, and considering the uncertainties in relation to 
safety and efficacy, the CHMP is of the opinion that the favourable effects outweigh the unfavourable 
effects in the indication “treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe prurigo nodularis (PN) who are 
candidates for systemic therapy”. The benefit-risk profile of dupilumab in PN appears to be consistent 
with the profiles already assessed for adult patients with AD, asthma and CRSwNP. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Dupilumab is positive in the following indication: 
Dupixent is indicated for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe prurigo nodularis (PN) who 
are candidates for systemic therapy.

Extension of indication to include treatment of adults with moderate to severe prurigo nodularis (PN) 
who are candidates for systemic therapy, based on results from studies EFC16459 and EFC16460 
(PRIME and PRIME2); these are two phase 3, 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
multi-centre, parallel group studies undertaken to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in 
patients 18 years of age and older with moderate to severe PN, who are inadequately controlled on 
topical prescription therapies or when those therapies are not advisable. As a consequence, sections 
4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in 
accordance. Version 8.1 of the RMP has also been approved. Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with 
the current excipients guideline. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annexes I, IIIA and IIIB and to the 
Risk Management Plan are recommended. 
Additional market protection 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of 
Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers that the new therapeutic indication 
brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies (see appendix). 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR 
module 8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

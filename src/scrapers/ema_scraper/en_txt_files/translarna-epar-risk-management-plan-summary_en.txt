Summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for 
Translarna (ataluren) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Translarna, which details the measures to be 
taken in order to ensure that Translarna is used as safely as possible. For more information on RMP 
summaries, see here. 
This RMP summary should be read in conjunction with the EPAR summary and the product information 
for Translarna, which can be found on Translarna’s EPAR page. 
Overview of disease epidemiology 
Translarna (ataluren) is a medicine used to treat patients aged 5 years and older with Duchenne 
muscular dystrophy (DMD) who are able to walk. DMD is a rare genetic disease that gradually causes 
weakness and loss of muscle function. It mainly affects boys and occurs in 1 in 3,500 male births. The 
disease is caused by defects (‘mutations’) in the gene for dystrophin, a protein that helps to protect 
muscles from injury as muscles contract and relax. Translarna is for use in the group of Duchenne 
patients whose disease is caused by a defect in the dystrophin gene called ‘nonsense mutation’. 
Approximately 13% of boys with DMD have this specific genetic defect. 
Summary of treatment benefits 
Translarna has been studied in one main study involving 174 patients, aged 5 to 20 years. In the 
study, patients were randomly assigned to receive either placebo (a dummy treatment), ataluren at a 
low dose of 40 mg/kg daily or ataluren at a high dose of 80 mg/kg daily. The main measure of 
effectiveness was the change in the distance the patient could walk in six minutes after 48 weeks of 
treatment. 
Although an initial analysis of the results of all the data from the study did not show a significant 
difference in the distances patients in the Translarna and placebo groups could walk, further analyses 
indicated that patients receiving the 40 mg/kg daily dose experienced a slower decline in walking 
ability than patients receiving placebo. There was no difference between the 80 mg/kg daily dose and 
placebo in the distance patients could walk in 6 minute following 48 weeks of treatment.   
Other measures of muscle function (climbing stairs, descending stairs, and walking/running 10 meters) 
suggested an improvement in the group receiving Translarna at 40 mg/kg daily compared with 
placebo. 
The safety data from this study showed that Translarna was well tolerated at both doses.   
Unknowns relating to treatment benefits 
Nearly all patients included in the main and supporting studies with Translarna were white Caucasians. 
There is no evidence to suggest that results would be any different in non-white patients.

children (such as mycophenolate mofetil, which is used for

Some of these medicines are commonly used in children, and include 
oseltamivir (for prevention of influenza), aciclovir (for treatment of 
chickenpox [varicella]), and ciprofloxacin (for treatment of 
infections); however, the usual treatment durations are relatively 
short (days to weeks) so co-administration can be avoided by 
temporarily interrupting ataluren treatment.   
Other medicines of these types may be used long term in DMD 
patients, and include agents for the treatment or prevention of 
congestive heart failure (such as captopril, furosemide, bumetanide, 
valsartan) or for lipid lowering (such as pravastatin, rosuvastatin, 
atorvastatin, pitavastatin). However, many other medicines of these 
types are not commonly used in children, and include agents for the 
treatment of chronic hepatitis B and/or HIV (such as adefovir, 
lamivudine, tenofovir, zalcitabine, zidovudine), or other illnesses 
more commonly seen in older adults, including methotrexate (for 
rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis), famotidine (for the treatment of 
active duodenal ulcer, gastroesophageal reflux disease), 
benzylpenicillin (for severe infections), sitagliptin (for type 2 
diabetes), and telmisartan and olmesartan (for essential 
hypertension in adults). 
Summary of risk minimisation measures by safety concern 
All medicines have a summary of product characteristics (SmPC) which provides physicians, 
pharmacists and other healthcare professionals with details on how to use the medicine, and also 
describes the risks and recommendations for minimising them. Information for patients is available in 
lay language in the package leaflet. The measures listed in these documents are known as ‘routine risk 
minimisation measures’. 
The SmPC and the package leaflet are part of the medicine’s product information. The product 
information for Translarna can be found on Translarna’s EPAR page. 
This medicine has no additional risk minimisation measures.

As maintenance therapy the dose must be individualised according to the response of the individual 
patient. The lowest possible dose should be used. 
Monitoring of the clinical response is necessary and patients should be observed closely for signs that 
might require dose adjustment, including changes in clinical status resulting from remissions or 
exacerbations of the disease, changes in electrolytes particularly hypokalaemia, individual 
responsiveness to the medicinal product, and the effect of stress (e.g. surgery, infection, trauma). As 
the treatment has a modified-release profile, blood tests are used to monitor clinical response, 
assessment of the evening dose should be done with a morning blood test and assessment of the 
morning dose should be done with an early afternoon blood test. 
During excessive physical and/or mental stress it may be necessary to increase the dose of Efmody, 
and/or add additional immediate release hydrocortisone especially in the afternoon or evening. 
Dose adjustments should be considered in case of concomitant use of potent CYP3A4 inducers or 
inhibitors (see section 4.5). 
Treatment in CAH 
Recommended replacement doses of hydrocortisone are 10-15 mg/m2/day in adolescents aged 12 
years and over who have not completed growth, and 15-25 mg/day in adolescents who have completed 
growth and adult patients with CAH. In patients with some remaining endogenous cortisol production 
a lower dose may be sufficient. 
At initiation the total daily dose should be split into two doses with two thirds to three quarters of the 
dose given in the evening at bedtime and the rest given in the morning. Patients should then be titrated 
based on their individual response.  
The morning dose should be taken on an empty stomach at least 1 hour before a meal and the evening 
dose taken at bedtime at least 2 hours after the last meal of the day.  
Changing from conventional oral glucocorticoid treatment to Efmody  
When changing patients from conventional oral hydrocortisone replacement therapy to Efmody, the 
identical total daily dose should be given, but the dose should be given in two doses with two thirds to 
three quarters of the dose given in the evening at bedtime and the rest given in the morning.  
When changing patients from other glucocorticoids to Efmody an appropriate conversion factor should 
be used, and the patient monitored for response carefully. 
Conversion to Efmody might elicit symptoms of adrenal insufficiency or overreplacement during dose 
optimisation. 
A starting dose exceeding 40 mg per day of hydrocortisone is not recommended. 
During serious trauma, intercurrent illness or periods of stress  
In severe situations, an increase in dose is immediately required and oral administration of 
hydrocortisone must be replaced with parenteral treatment (see section 4.4).  
In less severe situations when parenteral administration of hydrocortisone is not required, during 
periods of physical and/or mental stress, additional immediate release hydrocortisone at the same total 
daily dose as Efmody should be given in three divided doses; Efmody should be continued as well 
with the usual regimen (i.e. a doubled daily dose of hydrocortisone) to allow for easy return to the 
normal replacement dose of Efmody once additional hydrocortisone is no longer required. 
3  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In case of long-term increases in hydrocortisone daily dose due to prolonged periods of stress or 
illness, the additional hydrocortisone should be carefully weaned off. 
Missed doses 
If a dose of Efmody is missed it is recommended that it be taken as soon as possible. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
No clinical data on the safety and efficacy of Efmody are available in elderly patients over the age of 
65 years.  
Renal impairment 
There is no need for dose adjustment in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. In patients 
with severe renal impairment monitoring of the clinical response is recommended and adjustment of 
dose may be necessary (see section 4.4).  
Hepatic impairment 
There is no need for dose adjustment in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. In patients 
with severe hepatic impairment monitoring of the clinical response is recommended and adjustment of 
dose may be necessary (see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
No clinical data on the safety and efficacy of Efmody are available in children aged below 12 years. 
Other hydrocortisone containing medicinal products are available for children below 12 years. 
Adolescents 
No clinical data on the safety and efficacy of Efmody are available in adolescents aged 12 to 18 years.  
Method of administration  
The capsules must be given orally. 
Patients should be advised to swallow the capsules with water to wash the capsules down. 
The capsules should not be chewed as chewing the capsule could affect the release profile.  
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Adrenal crisis 
Acute adrenal insufficiency may develop in patients with known adrenal insufficiency who are on 
inadequate daily doses or in situations with increased cortisol need. Therefore, patients should be 
advised of the signs and symptoms of acute adrenal insufficiency and of adrenal crisis and the need to 
seek immediate medical attention. Sudden discontinuation of therapy with hydrocortisone risks 
triggering an adrenal crisis and death. 
4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During adrenal crisis parenteral, preferably intravenous administration of hydrocortisone in high 
doses, together with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion, should be administered 
according to current treatment guidelines. 
Pre-operatively, during serious trauma or during intercurrent illness  
Pre-operatively, anaesthetists must be informed if the patient is taking corticosteroids or has 
previously taken corticosteroids. 
Parenteral administration of hydrocortisone is warranted during transient illness episodes such as 
severe infections, in particular gastroenteritis associated with vomiting and/or diarrhoea, high fever of 
any aetiology or extensive physical stress, such as for instance serious accidents and surgery under 
general anaesthesia. Where parenteral hydrocortisone is required, the patient should be treated in a 
facility with resuscitation facilities in case of evolving adrenal crisis. 
In less severe situations when parenteral administration of hydrocortisone is not required, for instance 
low grade infections, moderate fever of any aetiology and stressful situations such as minor surgical 
procedures, there should be high awareness of the risk of developing acute adrenal insufficiency. 
Infections  
Infection should not be more likely at a replacement dose of hydrocortisone, but all infections should 
be taken seriously, and an increase in steroid dose be initiated early (see section 4.2). Patients with 
CAH are at risk of life-threatening adrenal crisis during infection so clinical suspicion of infection 
should be high and specialist advice should be sought early. 
Immunisation  
Treatment schedules of corticosteroids for people with CAH do not cause immunosuppression and are 
not, therefore, contraindications for administration of live vaccines. 
Undesirable effects of corticosteroid replacement therapy 
Most undesirable effects of corticosteroids are dose and duration of exposure related. Undesirable 
effects are therefore less likely when using corticosteroids as replacement therapy. 
Impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes are associated with treatment with glucocorticoids. Patients 
should be warned of the signs of diabetes and the need to seek medical advice if they occur.  
All glucocorticoids increase calcium excretion and reduce the bone-remodelling rate. Long-term 
glucocorticoid replacement therapy may therefore reduce bone mineral density (see section 4.8).  
Patients should be warned that potentially severe psychiatric adverse reactions; euphoria, mania, 
psychosis with hallucinations and delirium have been seen in adult patients at replacement doses of 
hydrocortisone (see section 4.8). Symptoms typically emerge within a few days or weeks of starting 
the treatment. Risks may be higher with high doses/systemic exposure (see also section 4.5), although 
dose levels do not allow prediction of the onset, type, severity or duration of reactions. Most reactions 
recover after either dose reduction or withdrawal, although specific treatment may be necessary. 
Patients should be encouraged to seek medical advice if worrying psychological symptoms develop, 
especially if depressed mood or suicidal ideation is suspected. Patients should also be alert to possible 
psychiatric disturbances that may occur either during or immediately after dose tapering/withdrawal of 
systemic steroids, although such reactions have been reported infrequently. 
Rare instances of anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving corticosteroids, medical 
advice should be sought immediately in the case of anaphylactoid symptoms (see section 4.8).

Gastric emptying and motility disorders 
Modified-release formulations, such as Efmody are not recommended in patients with increased 
gastrointestinal motility, i.e. chronic diarrhoea, due to the risk of impaired cortisol exposure. There are 
no data in patients with confirmed slow gastric emptying or decreased motility disease/disorder. The 
clinical response should be monitored in patients with these conditions.  
Growth retardation 
Corticosteroids may cause growth retardation in childhood and adolescence; this may be irreversible. 
Treatment should be limited to the minimum dose required to achieve desired clinical response and 
when reduction in dose is possible, the reduction should be gradual. Excessive weight gain with 
decreased height velocity or other symptoms or signs of Cushing syndrome indicate excessive 
glucocorticoid replacement. Children require frequent assessment to assess growth, blood pressure, 
and general well-being. 
Accelerated sexual maturation 
Adolescents with CAH may show accelerated sexual maturation. Patients should be closely 
monitored; and if signs of early puberty or accelerated sexual maturation are present, an increase in 
dose should be  considered. Careful and regular monitoring of adolescent patients with dose 
adjustment according to the response of the individual patient is recommended. 
Visual disturbance 
Visual disturbance may be reported with systemic and topical corticosteroid use. If a patient presents 
with symptoms such as blurred vision or other visual disturbances, the patient should be considered for 
referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation of possible causes which may include cataract, glaucoma 
or rare diseases such as central serous chorioretinopathy which have been reported after use of 
systemic and topical corticosteroids.  
Treatment of CAH often warrants additional treatment with mineralocorticosteroids. 
Precaution 
In both men and women who have lower fertility due to CAH, fertility may be restored shortly after 
beginning treatment with Efmody, which can lead to unexpected pregnancies. Patients should be 
informed of the potential for restored fertility when starting treatment with Efmody, to be able to 
consider if a contraceptive measure is needed (see section 4.6). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Hydrocortisone is metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Concomitant administration of 
medicinal products that are inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 may therefore lead to unwanted 
alterations in serum concentrations of hydrocortisone with the risk of adverse reactions, particularly 
adrenal crisis. The need for dose adjustment when such medicinal products are used can be anticipated 
and patients should be closely monitored. 
Medicinal products inducing CYP3A4, requiring a potential increase in Efmody dosing, include but 
are not limited to: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Anticonvulsants: phenytoin, carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine 
Antibiotics: rifampicin and rifabutin 
Barbiturates including phenobarbital and primidone 
Antiretroviral medicinal products: efavirenz and nevirapine 
Herbal medicinal products such as St. John's Wort 
6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Medicinal products/substances inhibiting CYP3A4, requiring a potential decrease in hydrocortisone 
dosing, include but are not limited to: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Anti-fungals: itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole 
Antibiotics: erythromycin  and clarithromycin  
Antiretroviral medicinal products: ritonavir  
Grapefruit juice 
Liquorice 
The desired actions of hypoglycaemic medicinal products including insulin are antagonised by 
corticosteroids. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy  
Hydrocortisone crosses the placenta. Hydrocortisone is preferentially metabolised by placental 
11βHSD2 to inactive cortisone reducing the fetal exposure. There are no indications that replacement 
therapy with hydrocortisone in pregnant women is associated with adverse consequences for the fetus. 
Hydrocortisone for replacement therapy can be used during pregnancy.  
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity of corticosteroids (see section 5.3). 
Breast-feeding 
Hydrocortisone is excreted in breast milk. However, the doses of hydrocortisone used for replacement 
therapy probably do not clinically significantly affect the child. Hydrocortisone for replacement 
therapy can be used during breast-feeding.  
Fertility 
In both men and women who have lower fertility due to CAH, fertility may be restored shortly after 
beginning treatment with Efmody. In women, a reduction of 17-OH progesterone and androstenedione 
will lead to a corresponding fall in progesterone and testosterone which may restore menses/fertility. 
(see section 4.4). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Efmody has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue and dizziness have been 
reported. Untreated and poorly replaced adrenal insufficiency may affect the ability to drive and use 
machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile 
In the clinical trial programme the overall most common serious adverse events were acute adrenal 
insufficiency (4.2% of patients treated with Efmody), another common reaction, in relation to Efmody 
was fatigue (11.7% of patients), headache (7.5%), increased appetite (5.8%), dizziness (5.8%) and 
increased weight (5.8%).  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The commonest reactions reported to Efmody in the pooled population in the clinical trial programme, 
are tabulated below. Frequencies are defined as very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10),

Events of acute adrenal insufficiency were reported during the clinical trial programme but none were 
considered related to Efmody. Acute adrenal insufficiency should be monitored for and treated 
promptly in patients with adrenal insufficiency (see section 4.2 and 4.4). 
Rare instances of anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving corticosteroids 
especially when a patient has a history of allergies to medicinal products. 
Historical cohorts of adults treated from childhood for CAH have been found to have reduced bone 
mineral density and increased fracture rates (see section 4.4) - it is unclear if these relate to 
hydrocortisone therapy using current replacement regimens. 
Historical cohorts of adults treated from childhood for CAH have been found to have raised 
cardiovascular risk factors and a higher risk of cerebrovascular disease than the general population - it 
is unclear if these relate to hydrocortisone therapy using current replacement regimens. 
Paediatric population 
No paediatric patients were included in the clinical development programme for Efmody. 
Hydrocortisone has been used for more than 60 years in paediatrics with a safety profile similar to that 
in adults. Growth retardation has been seen in children treated with hydrocortisone for CAH and can 
8  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
be caused by both the disorder and hydrocortisone. Accelerated sexual maturation has been seen in 
hydrocortisone-treated paediatric CAH patients and is associated with excess adrenal androgen 
production (see section 4.4).  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Reports of acute toxicity and/or deaths following hydrocortisone overdose are rare. No antidote is 
available. Treatment is probably not indicated for reactions due to chronic poisoning unless the patient 
has a condition that would render him/her unusually susceptible to ill effects from hydrocortisone. In 
which case, symptomatic treatment should be instituted as necessary.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Corticosteroids for systemic use; glucocorticoids. ATC code: H02AB09. 
Mechanism of action 
Hydrocortisone is a glucocorticoid. Glucocorticoids have multiple effects in multiple tissues through 
actions on the intracellular steroid receptors. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Hydrocortisone is a glucocorticoid and the synthetic form of endogenously produced cortisol. 
Glucocorticoids are adrenocortical steroids, both naturally occurring and synthetic, which are readily 
absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract. Cortisol is the principal corticosteroid secreted by the adrenal 
cortex. Naturally occurring glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone and cortisone), which also have salt-
retaining properties, are used as replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states. They are also 
used for their potent anti-inflammatory effects in disorders of many organ systems. Glucocorticoids 
cause profound and varied metabolic effects. In addition, they modify the body’s immune responses to 
diverse stimuli.  
Clinical efficacy and safety 
A study in 122 participants with genetically diagnosed 21-hydroxylase deficiency randomised to 
Efmody or continuation of standard care with blinded titration of dose and regular overnight profiles 
failed to meet its primary endpoint of superiority in change from baseline to 24 weeks of the mean of 
the 24-hour standard deviation score (SDS) profile for 17-hydroxyprogesterone 17-OHP. The 17-OHP 
SDS was lower in the Efmody cohort than standard therapy at 4 and 12 weeks. At 24 weeks the 17-
OHP SDS was lower in the morning period (07:00 hrs to 15:00 hrs) but not in the evening or overnight 
(see also Figure 1 for the geometric mean 24-hour profile of 17-OHP after 24 weeks intensive 
treatment). A reduction in the 17-OHP area under the curve occurred in both groups, with greater 
reduction in the Efmody cohort. The percentage of patients with controlled 09:00 hrs 17-OHP 
(<36nmol/l) was 50% at baseline and at 24 weeks was 91% in the Efmody cohort and 71% in the 
standard therapy cohort. Efmody patients suffered no adrenal crises (compared to 3 in the control arm) 
and had fewer sick day episodes where increased dosing due to stress was required was required (26 
vs 36 in the control arm) despite reporting more episodes of intercurrent infective or gastro-intestinal

illness. Glucocorticoid daily dose, measured as a hydrocortisone equivalent dose, increased in most 
subjects during the study (see Table 2).

Standard GC 24 weeks 
  Efmody 24 weeks 
A safety extension study of 91 patients with titration by investigators was characterised by dose 
reductions with median daily dose of Efmody at 18 months interim analysis (n=50) being 20 mg (from 
a median baseline daily dose of 30 mg) with 17-OHP levels remaining in the clinically determined 
optimal range and androstenedione at or below the reference range for normal individual. 
In the safety assessment of clinical studies, differences between the treatment arms in treatment related 
AE’s were reported (by preferred term [PT]). The most notable differences between the Efmody and 
standard glucocorticoid therapy pools, respectively, were observed for headache (7.5% vs 1.6%), 
increased appetite (5.8% vs 3.3%), weight increase (including abnormal weight gain) (9.2% vs1.6%), 
decreased appetite (5.0% vs 0%) and nausea (4.2% vs 1.6%).”

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following a single oral administration in fasted dexamethasone-suppressed healthy adults, the rate of 
absorption of hydrocortisone from Efmody 20 mg was delayed and reduced compared to immediate 
release hydrocortisone tablets 20 mg, as reflected by a lower Cmax and a significantly longer Tmax for 
Efmody (median Tmax for serum cortisol of 4.5 hours and 0.88 hours for Efmody and hydrocortisone 
tablets respectively). Efmody appeared to be more bioavailable relative to immediate release 
hydrocortisone tablets, with overall exposure to serum cortisol and derived free cortisol approximately 
19% and 13% higher respectively for Efmody.  
In the same population, food (high fat meal started 30 minutes before dosing) was found to delay and 
reduce the rate of absorption of hydrocortisone from Efmody 20 mg, as reflected by a longer Tmax 
(median Tmax for serum cortisol of 6.75 hours and 4.5 hours for fed and fasted subjects respectively) 
and lower Cmax (reduced by approximately 20% in fed subjects). Overall exposure appeared similar in 
fed and fasted subjects (90% confidence intervals for the fed/fasted ratio of the geometric least square 
mean of AUC0-t and AUC0-inf were within 80-125%). This effect is therefore not considered clinically 
significant. 
Distribution 
90% or more of circulating hydrocortisone is reversibly bound to protein. 
The binding is accounted for by two protein fractions. One, corticosteroid-binding globulin is a 
glycoprotein; the other is albumin. 
Biotransformation  
Hydrocortisone is metabolised in the liver and most body tissues to hydrogenated and degraded forms 
such as tetrahydrocortisone and tetrahydrocortisol which are excreted in the urine, mainly conjugated 
as glucuronides, together with a very small proportion of unchanged hydrocortisone. Hydrocortisone is 
both metabolised by and a regulator of CYP3A4. 
Elimination 
In the fasted dexamethasone-suppressed healthy adult population described above, terminal 
elimination half-life values were similar for Efmody and hydrocortisone tablets (geometric mean t1/2 
for serum cortisol of 1.38 hours and 1.40 hours respectively). Clearance appeared higher for 
hydrocortisone tablets relative to Efmody (geometric mean CL/F for serum cortisol of 22.24 L/h and 
18.48 L/h respectively). 
Paediatrics  
The pharmacokinetics of Efmody have not been studied in the paediatric population.  
Other populations 
No studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Administration of corticosteroids to pregnant animals can cause abnormalities of fetal development 
including cleft palate, intrauterine growth retardation and effects on brain growth and development.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Efmody is and what it is used for 
Medicine contains the active substance hydrocortisone. Hydrocortisone belongs to a group of 
medicines known as corticosteroids. 
Hydrocortisone is a copy of the hormone cortisol. Cortisol is made by the adrenal glands in the body.  
Efmody is used when the adrenal gland are not making enough cortisol due to an inherited condition 
called congenital adrenal hyperplasia. It is for use in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Efmody 
Do not take Efmody 
- 
If you are allergic to hydrocortisone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Efmody if the following apply: 
Adrenal crisis 
- 
You have an adrenal crisis. If you are vomiting or seriously unwell, you may need an injection 
of hydrocortisone. Your doctor will train you how to do this in an emergency. 
Infections 
- 
You have an infection or you do not feel well. Your doctor may need to prescribe extra 
hydrocortisone temporarily.   
Immunisation 
- 
You are due to be vaccinated. Usually, taking Efmody should not stop you receiving 
vaccination. 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you had lower fertility due to congenital adrenal hyperplasia, your fertility may be restored, 
Fertility 
-

your contraceptive needs before starting Efmody. 
Other 
- 
- 
You are due for an operation. Tell the surgeon or anaesthetist that you are receiving Efmody 
before your operation. 
You have a long-term condition of your digestive system (such as chronic diarrhoea) that affects 
how well your gut absorbs food. Your doctor may prescribe another medicine instead or 
monitor you more closely to check that you are getting the right amount of the medicine. 
You should not stop taking Efmody without checking with your doctor as this could make you 
seriously unwell very quickly. 
As Efmody is replacing the normal hormone your body lacks, side effects are less likely, however: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Too much Efmody can affect your bones so your doctor will monitor  the dose closely. 
Some patients taking hydrocortisone Efmody became anxious, depressed or confused.Tell your 
doctor if you develop any unusual behaviour or feel suicidal after starting medication (see 
section 4). 
In rare cases allergy to hydrocortisone can occur. People who already have allergies to other 
medicines may be more likely to develop allergy to hydrocortisone.Tell your doctor straight 
away if you have any reaction like swelling or shortness of breath after being given Efmody (see 
section 4). 
Hydrocortisone may cause diabetes. If you have symptoms of excessive thirst or need to pass 
urine excessively tell your doctor straight away. 
Treatment with steroids can lead to low blood potassium.  Your doctor will monitor your 
potassium levels to check for any changes. 
Hydrocortisone can reduce growth in children.Your doctor will monitor your growth while you 
are on Efmody.  
Children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia taking hydrocortisone might show signs of sexual 
development or puberty earlier than usually expected.Your doctor will monitor your 
development while you are on Efmody.  
- 
Contact your doctor if you have blurred vision or other visual disturbances. 
Other medicines and Efmody 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Some medicines can affect the way that Efmody works and may mean that your doctor needs to alter 
your dose of Efmody. 
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Your doctor may need to increase your dose of Efmody if you take certain medicines, including: 
-

Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
Hydrocortisone is known to cross the placenta in pregnancy and is present in breast milk, however 
there is no evidence this causes any harm to the infant. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you 
may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this 
medicine.  
If you are a woman who has not gone through menopause your periods might return or become more 
regular. The restored fertility may lead to unexpected pregnancy even before the reoccurrence of 
menstrual bleeding.  See also section “Warnings and Precautions” regarding fertility in both men and 
women. 
Driving and using machines 
Efmody has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Untreated adrenal insufficiency 
may affect the ability to drive and use machines. Tell your doctor immediately if you feel tired or 
dizzy when taking Efmody.

ANNEX IV 
SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS FOR THE VARIATION TO THE 
TERMS OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION(S)

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for hydrocortisone (for centrally 
authorised  products  for  adrenal  insufficiency,  congenital  adrenal  hyperplasia,  modified-release 
formulations), the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In  view  of  available  data  on  early  improved  fertility  from  clinical  trials  and  spontaneous  reports 
including seven cases with a close temporal relationship, and in view of a plausible mechanism of 
action,  the  PRAC  considers  a  causal  relationship  between  Efmody,  and  early  improvement  of 
infertility is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of 
Efmody should be amended accordingly. 
Update  of  section  4.4  and  4.6  of  the  SmPC  to  add  a  precaution  regarding  unexpected  early 
improvement of infertility (4.4) and delete information regarding fertility (4.6). The Package leaflet 
is updated accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for hydrocortisone (for centrally authorised products for 
adrenal insufficiency, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, modified-release formulations) the CHMP is 
of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of Efmody is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation for Efmody should be varied.

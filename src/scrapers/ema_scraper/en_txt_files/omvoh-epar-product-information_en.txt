For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.  
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Concentrate for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate) 
The concentrate is a clear and colourless to slightly yellow solution with a pH of approximately 5.5 
and an osmolarity of approximately 300 mOsm/L. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
Omvoh is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative 
colitis who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either 
conventional therapy or a biologic treatment. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
This medicinal product is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a physician 
experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of ulcerative colitis.  
Omvoh 300 mg concentrate for solution for infusion should only be used for the induction dose.  
Posology 
The recommended mirikizumab dose regimen has 2 parts. 
Induction dose 
The induction dose is 300 mg by intravenous infusion for at least 30 minutes at weeks 0, 4 and 8. 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Maintenance dose 
The maintenance dose is 200 mg (i.e. two pre-filled syringes or two pre-filled pens) by subcutaneous 
injection every 4 weeks after completion of induction dosing. 
For the posology of the subcutaneous dosing regimen, see section 4.2 of the Summary of Product 
Characteristics for Omvoh 100 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe and Omvoh 100 mg 
solution for injection in pre-filled pen. 
Patients should be evaluated after the 12-week induction dosing and if there is adequate therapeutic 
response, transition to maintenance dosing. For patients who do not achieve adequate therapeutic 
benefit at week 12 of induction dosing, mirikizumab 300 mg by intravenous infusion may be 
continued at weeks 12, 16 and 20 (extended induction therapy). If therapeutic benefit is achieved 
with the additional intravenous therapy, patients may initiate mirikizumab subcutaneous maintenance 
dosing (200 mg) every 4 weeks, starting at week 24. Mirikizumab should be discontinued in patients 
who do not show evidence of therapeutic benefit to extended induction therapy by week 24. 
Patients with loss of therapeutic response during maintenance treatment may receive 300 mg 
mirikizumab by intravenous infusion every 4 weeks, for a total of 3 doses (re-induction). If clinical 
benefit is achieved from this additional intravenous therapy, patients may resume mirikizumab 
subcutaneous dosing every 4 weeks. The efficacy and safety of repeated re-induction therapy have 
not been evaluated. 
Elderly  
No dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). There is limited information in subjects aged 
≥ 75 years. 
Renal or hepatic impairment 
Omvoh has not been studied in these patient populations. These conditions are generally not 
expected to have any significant impact on the pharmacokinetics of monoclonal antibodies and no 
dose adjustments are considered necessary (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Omvoh in children and adolescents aged 2 to less than 18 years have not 
yet been established. No data are available. 
There is no relevant use of Omvoh in children below 2 years for the indication of ulcerative colitis. 
Method of administration 
Omvoh 300 mg concentrate for solution for infusion is for intravenous use only. Each vial is for 
single use only. 
For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
Administration of the diluted solution 
•  The intravenous administration set (infusion line) should be connected to the prepared 
intravenous bag and the line should be primed. The infusion should be administered for at least 
30 minutes. 
•  At the end of the infusion, to ensure a full dose is administered, the infusion line should be 
flushed with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution or 5 % glucose solution for injection. 
The flush should be administered at the same rate as used for Omvoh administration. The time 
required to flush Omvoh solution from the infusion line is in addition to the minimum 
30 minutes infusion time.

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Clinically important active infections (active tuberculosis). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
In clinical studies, hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Most were mild or moderate, 
severe reactions were uncommon (see section 4.8). If a serious hypersensitivity reaction, including 
anaphylaxis, occurs, mirikizumab must be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy must 
be initiated. 
Infections 
Mirikizumab may increase the risk of severe infection (see section 4.8). Treatment with mirikizumab 
should not be initiated in patients with a clinically important active infection until the infection 
resolves or is adequately treated (see section 4.3). The risks and benefits of treatment should be 
considered prior to initiating use of mirikizumab in patients with a chronic infection or a history of 
recurrent infection. Patients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms of 
clinically important acute or chronic infection occur. If a serious infection develops, discontinuation 
of mirikizumab should be considered until the infection resolves. 
Pre-treatment evaluation for tuberculosisPrior to initiating treatment, patients should be evaluated 
for tuberculosis (TB) infection. Patients receiving mirikizumab should be monitored for signs and 
symptoms of active TB during and after treatment. Anti-TB therapy should be considered prior to 
initiating treatment in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course 
of treatment cannot be confirmed . 
Hepatic enzyme elevations 
Cases of drug-induced liver injury (including one case meeting Hy’s Law criteria) occurred in 
patients receiving mirikizumab in clinical trials. Liver enzymes and bilirubin should be evaluated at 
baseline and monthly during induction (including extended induction period, if applicable). 
Thereafter, liver enzymes and bilirubin should be monitored (every 1 - 4 months) according to 
standard practice for patient management and as clinically indicated. If increases in alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are observed and drug-induced liver 
injury is suspected, mirikizumab must be discontinued until this diagnosis is excluded.

Immunisations 
Prior to initiating therapy with mirikizumab, completion of all appropriate immunisations should be 
considered according to current immunisation guidelines. Avoid use of live vaccines in patients 
treated with mirikizumab. No data are available on the response to live or non-live vaccines. 
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains 60 mg sodium per 300 mg dose, equivalent to 3 % of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. 
If prepared with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution for injection the amount of sodium 
contributed by the sodium chloride diluent will range from 177 mg (for a 50 mL bag) to 885 mg (for 
a 250 mL bag), equivalent to 9-44 % of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake. This is in 
addition to the amount contributed by the medicinal product. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
No interaction studies have been performed.  
In ulcerative colitis studies, concomitant use of corticosteroids or oral immunomodulators did not 
influence the safety of mirikizumab. 
Population pharmacokinetic data analyses indicated that the clearance of mirikizumab was not 
impacted by concomitant administration of 5-ASAs (5-aminosalicylic acid), corticosteroids or oral 
immunomodulators (azathioprine, mercaptopurine, thioguanine, and methotrexate) in patients with 
ulcerative colitis. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential should use an effective method of contraception during treatment 
and for at least 10 weeks after treatment. 
Pregnancy 
There is a limited amount of data from the use of mirikizumab in pregnant women. Animal studies 
do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see 
section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Omvoh during 
pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether mirikizumab is excreted in human milk. Human IgGs are known to be 
excreted in breast milk during the first few days after birth, which is decreasing to low 
concentrations soon afterwards; consequently, a risk to the breast-fed infant cannot be excluded 
during this short period. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to 
discontinue/abstain from Omvoh therapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the 
child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
The effect of mirikizumab on human fertility has not been evaluated (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Omvoh has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Infusion-related hypersensitivity reactions (LUCENT-1, weeks 1-12) 
Infusion-related hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 0.4 % of mirikizumab-treated patients. 
All infusion-related hypersensitivity reactions were reported as non-serious. 
Injection site reactions (LUCENT-2, weeks 12-52) 
Injection site reactions were reported in 8.7 % mirikizumab-treated patients. The most frequent 
reactions were injection site pain, injection site reaction and injection site erythema. These symptoms 
were reported as non-serious, mild and transient in nature. 
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased 
In the first 12 weeks (LUCENT-1), ALT increased was reported in 0.4 % mirikizumab-treated 
patients. AST increased was reported by 0.5 % mirikizumab-treated patients. All adverse reactions 
were reported as mild to moderate in severity and non-serious. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Over all mirikizumab treatment periods in the ulcerative colitis clinical development program 
(including the placebo-controlled and open label induction and maintenance periods), there have 
been elevations of ALT to ≥ 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (2.0 %), ≥ 5 x ULN (0.7 %) and 
≥ 10 x ULN (0.2 %) and AST to ≥ 3 x ULN (2.1 %), ≥ 5 x ULN (1.1 %) and ≥ 10 x ULN (0.1 %) in 
patients receiving mirikizumab (see section 4.4). These elevations have been noted with and without 
concomitant elevations in total bilirubin. 
Immunogenicity 
With 12 months of treatment, up to 23 % of mirikizumab-treated patients developed anti-drug 
antibodies, most of which were of low titer and tested positive for neutralising activity. Higher 
antibody titers in approximately 2 % of subjects treated with mirikizumab were associated with 
lower serum mirikizumab concentrations and reduced clinical response. No association was found 
between anti-mirikizumab antibodies and hypersensitivity or injection site reactions. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
Mirikizumab doses up to 2 400 mg intravenously and up to 500 mg subcutaneously have been 
administered in clinical trials without dose-limiting toxicity. In the event of overdose, the patient 
must be monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic 
treatment must be started immediately.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC24 
Mechanism of action 
Mirikizumab is a humanised IgG4 monoclonal, anti-interleukin-23 (anti-IL-23) antibody that 
selectively binds to the p19 subunit of human IL-23 cytokine and inhibits its interaction with the 
IL-23 receptor.  
IL-23, a regulatory cytokine, affects the differentiation, expansion, and survival of T cell subsets, 
(e.g., Th17 cells and Tc17 cells) and innate immune cell subsets, which represent sources of effector 
cytokines, including IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-22 that drive inflammatory disease. In humans, selective 
blockade of IL-23 was shown to normalise production of these cytokines. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Inflammatory biomarkers were measured in the phase 3 ulcerative colitis studies. Mirikizumab 
administered intravenously every 4 weeks during induction dosing significantly reduced levels of 
fecal calprotectin and C-reactive protein from baseline to week 12. Also, mirikizumab administered 
subcutaneously every 4 weeks during maintenance dosing sustained significantly reduced levels of 
fecal calprotectin and C-reactive protein through 40 weeks.

Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy and safety of mirikizumab was evaluated in adult patients with moderately to severely 
active ulcerative colitis in two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre studies. 
Enrolled patients had a confirmed diagnosis of ulcerative colitis for at least 3 months and moderately 
to severely active disease, defined as a modified Mayo score of 4 to 9, including a Mayo endoscopy 
subscore ≥ 2. Patients had to have failed (defined as loss of response, inadequate response or 
intolerance) corticosteroids or immunomodulators (6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine) or at least one 
biologic (a TNFα antagonist and/or vedolizumab) or tofacitinib. 
LUCENT-1 was an intravenous induction study with treatment of up to 12 weeks, followed by a 
40 week subcutaneous randomised withdrawal maintenance study (LUCENT-2), representing at least 
52 weeks of therapy. Mean age was 42.5 years. 7.8 % of patients were ≥ 65 of age and 1.0 % of 
patients ≥ 75 of age. 59.8 % were men; 40.2 % were women. 53.2 % had severely active disease with 
a modified Mayo score 7 to 9. 
Efficacy results presented for LUCENT-1 and LUCENT-2 were based on central reading of 
endoscopies and histology. 
LUCENT-1  
LUCENT-1 included 1 162 patients in the primary efficacy population. Patients were randomised to 
receive a dose of 300 mg mirikizumab via intravenous infusion or placebo, at week 0, week 4 and 
week 8 with a 3:1 treatment allocation ratio. The primary endpoint for the induction study was the 
proportion of subjects in clinical remission [modified Mayo score (MMS) defined as: Stool 
frequency (SF) subscore = 0 or 1 with a ≥ 1-point decrease from baseline, and rectal bleeding (RB) 
subscore = 0, and Endoscopic subscore (ES) = 0 or 1 (excluding friability)] at week 12. 
Patients in these studies may have received other concomitant therapies including 
aminosalicylates (74.3 %), immunomodulatory agents (24.1 % such as azathioprine, 
6-mercaptopurine or methotrexate), and oral corticosteroids (39.9 %; prednisone daily dose up to 
20 mg or equivalent) at a stable dose prior to and during the induction period. Per protocol oral 
corticosteroids were tapered after induction. 
Of the primary efficacy population, 57.1 % were biologic-naive and tofacitinib-naive. 41.2 % of 
patients had failed a biologic or tofacitinib. 36.3 % of the patients had failed at least 1 prior anti-TNF 
therapy, 18.8 % had failed vedolizumab and 3.4 % of patients had failed tofacitinib. 20.1 % had 
failed more than one biologic or tofacitinib. An additional 1.7 % had previously received but had not 
failed a biologic or tofacitinib. 
In LUCENT-1 a significantly greater proportion of patients were in clinical remission in the 
mirikizumab treated group compared to placebo at week 12 (Table 2). As early as week 2, 
mirikizumab-treated patients achieved a greater reduction in RB subscores and decreases in SF 
subscores.

LUCENT-2 
LUCENT-2 evaluated 544 patients out of the 551 patients who achieved clinical response with 
mirikizumab in LUCENT-1 at week 12 (see Table 2). Patients were re-randomised in a 2:1 treatment 
allocation ratio to receive a subcutaneous maintenance regimen of 200 mg mirikizumab or placebo 
every 4 weeks for 40 weeks (which is 52 weeks from initiation of the induction dose). The primary 
endpoint for the maintenance study was the proportion of subjects in clinical remission (same 
definition as in LUCENT-1) at week 40. Corticosteroid tapering was required upon entrance into 
LUCENT-2 for patients who were receiving corticosteroids during LUCENT-1. Significantly greater 
proportions of patients were in clinical remission in the mirikizumab-treated group compared to the 
placebo group at week 40 (see Table 3).

a)  An additional 1 patient on placebo and 8 patients on mirikizumab where previously exposed to 
but did not fail a biologic or JAK-inhibitor. 
b)  Loss of response, inadequate response or intolerance. 
c)  p < 0.001 
d)  Mirikizumab results in the subgroup of patients who failed more than one biologic or 
JAK-inhibitor were consistent with results in the overall population. 
The efficacy and safety profile of mirikizumab was consistent across subgroups, i.e. age, gender, 
body weight, disease activity severity at baseline and region. The effect size may vary. 
At week 40, a greater proportion of patients were in clinical response (defined as decrease in the 
MMS of ≥ 2 points and ≥ 30 % decrease from baseline, and a decrease of ≥ 1 point in the RB 
subscore from baseline or a RB score of 0 or 1) in the mirikizumab responder group re-randomised 
to mirikizumab (80 %) compared to the mirikizumab responder group re-randomised to placebo 
(49 %). 
Week 24 responders to mirikizumab extended induction (LUCENT-2) 
For the mirikizumab patients who were not in response at week 12 of LUCENT-1 and received 
open-label additional 3 doses of 300 mg mirikizumab IV every 4 weeks (Q4W) 53.7 % achieved 
clinical response at week 12 of LUCENT-2 and 52.9 % mirikizumab patients continued to 
maintenance receiving 200 mg mirikizumab Q4W SC, and among these patients 72.2 % achieved 
clinical response and 36.1 % achieved clinical remission at week 40. 
Recapture of efficacy after loss of response to mirikizumab maintenance (LUCENT-2) 
19 patients who experienced a first loss of response (5.2 %) between week 12 and 28 of LUCENT-2 
received open-label mirikizumab rescue dosing with 300 mg mirikizumab Q4W IV for 3 doses and 
12 of these patients (63.2 %) achieved symptomatic response and 7 patients (36.8 %) achieved 
symptomatic remission after 12 weeks. 
Endoscopic normalisation at week 40 
Normalisation of endoscopic appearance of the mucosa was defined as a Mayo endoscopic subscore 
of 0. At week 40 of LUCENT-2, endoscopic normalisation was achieved in 81/365 (22.2 %) of 
patients treated with mirikizumab and in 24/179 (13.4 %) of patients in placebo group. 
Histologic outcomes 
At week 12 greater proportions of patients in the mirikizumab group achieved histologic 
improvement (39.2 %) compared with patients in the placebo group (20.7 %). At week 40 histologic 
remission was observed with more patients in the mirikizumab group (48.5 %) as compared to 
placebo (24.6 %). 
Stable maintenance of symptomatic remission 
Stable maintenance of symptomatic remission was defined as the proportion of patients in 
symptomatic remission for at least 7 out of 9 visits from week 4 to week 36 and in symptomatic 
remission at week 40 among patients in symptomatic remission and clinical response at week 12 of 
LUCENT-1. At week 40 of LUCENT-2, the proportion of patients achieving stable maintenance of 
symptomatic remission was greater in patients treated with mirikizumab (69.7 %) versus placebo 
(38.4 %). 
Health-related quality of life 
At week 12 of LUCENT-1, patients receiving mirikizumab showed significantly greater clinically 
relevant improvements on the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) total score 
(p ≤ 0.001) when compared to placebo. IBDQ response was defined as at least a 16-point 
improvement from baseline in IBDQ score and IBDQ remission was defined as a score of at 
least 170. At week 12 of LUCENT-1, 57.5 % of mirikizumab-treated patients achieved IBDQ 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
remission versus 39.8 % with placebo (p < 0.001) and 72.7 % of mirikizumab-treated patients 
achieved IBDQ response versus 55.8 % in placebo. In LUCENT-2 at week 40, 72.3 % of 
mirikizumab-treated patients achieved maintenance of IBDQ remission versus 43.0 % placebo 
treated patients and 79.2 % mirikizumab treated patients achieved IBDQ response versus 49.2 % of 
placebo treated patients. 
Patient reported outcomes 
Decreases in bowel urgency severity were observed as early as week 2 in patients treated with 
mirikizumab in LUCENT-1. Patients receiving mirikizumab achieved significant bowel urgency 
remission compared with patients in the placebo group at week 12 in LUCENT-1 (22.1 % vs 
12.3 %), and week 40 in LUCENT-2 (42.9 % vs 25 %). Patients receiving mirikizumab showed 
significant improvements in fatigue as early as week 2 of LUCENT-1 and the improvements were 
maintained at week 40 of LUCENT-2. As early as week 4 there was also a significantly greater 
reduction in abdominal pain.  
Hospitalisations and ulcerative colitis related surgeries 
Through week 12 of LUCENT-1, the proportion of patients with UC-related hospitalisations were 
0.3 % (3/868) in the mirikizumab and 3.4 % (10/294) in the placebo group. UC-related surgeries 
were reported in 0.3 % (3/868) patients receiving mirikizumab and 0.7 % (2/294) patients in the 
placebo group. There were no UC-related hospitalisations and no UC-related surgeries in 
LUCENT-2 in the mirikizumab arm.  
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Omvoh in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of ulcerative colitis (see 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
There was no apparent accumulation in serum mirikizumab concentration over time when given 
subcutaneously every 4 weeks. 
Mean (coefficient variation [CV %]) Cmax and area under the curve (AUC) after induction dosing 
(300 mg every 4 weeks administered by intravenous infusion) in patients with ulcerative colitis were 
99.7 (22.7) µg/mL and 538 (34.4) µg*day/mL, respectively. The mean (CV %) Cmax and AUC after 
maintenance dosing (200 mg every 4 weeks by subcutaneous injection) were 10.1 (52.1) µg/mL and 
160 (57.6) µg*day/mL, respectively. 
Absorption 
Following subcutaneous dosing of mirikizumab, peak serum concentrations were achieved 2-3 days 
post dose with an estimated absolute bioavailability of 44 %. 
Injection site location did not significantly influence absorption of mirikizumab. 
Distribution 
The mean total volume of distribution was 4.83 L. 
Biotransformation 
Mirikizumab is a humanised IgG4 monoclonal antibody and is expected to be degraded into small 
peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgGs. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elimination 
In the population PK analysis, mean apparent clearance was 0.0229 L/hr and the mean elimination 
half-life is approximately 9.3 days in patients with ulcerative colitis. Clearance is independent of 
dose. 
Dose proportionality 
Mirikizumab exhibited linear pharmacokinetics with dose-proportional increase in exposure over a 
dose range of 5 to 2 400 mg given as an intravenous infusion or over a dose range of 120 to 400 mg 
given as a subcutaneous injection in patients with ulcerative colitis or in healthy volunteers. 
Special populations 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that age, sex, weight, or race/ethnicity did not have a 
clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of mirikizumab (see also section 4.8, 
“immunogenicity”). Among the 1 362 subjects with ulcerative colitis exposed to mirikizumab in 
Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies, 99 (7.3 %) patients were 65 years or older and 11 (0.8 %) patients were 
75 years or older. 
Renal or hepatic impairment 
Specific clinical pharmacology studies to evaluate the effects of renal impairment and hepatic 
impairment on the pharmacokinetics of mirikizumab have not been conducted. Population 
pharmacokinetic analysis showed that creatinine clearance (range of 36.2 to 291 mL/min) or total 
bilirubin (range of 1.5 to 29 µmol/L) did not affect mirikizumab pharmacokinetics. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, toxicity to reproduction and development. 
Carcinogenesis / mutagenesis 
Non-clinical studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of 
mirikizumab. 
Impairment of fertility 
No reproductive organ weight or histopathology effects were observed in sexually mature 
cynomolgus monkeys that received mirikizumab once weekly for 26 weeks, at a dose of 100 mg/kg 
(at least 30 times the human maintenance dose).

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
Omvoh is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative 
colitis who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either 
conventional therapy or a biologic treatment. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
This medicinal product is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a physician 
experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of ulcerative colitis. 
Omvoh 100 mg solution for injection should only be used for the subcutaneous maintenance doses. 
Posology 
The recommended mirikizumab dose regimen has 2 parts. 
Induction dose 
The induction dose is 300 mg by intravenous infusion for at least 30 minutes at weeks 0, 4 and 8. 
(See Summary of Product Characteristics for Omvoh 300 mg concentrate for solution for infusion, 
section 4.2.) 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Maintenance dose 
The maintenance dose is 200 mg (i.e. two pre-filled syringes or two pre-filled pens) by subcutaneous 
injection every 4 weeks after completion of induction dosing. 
Patients should be evaluated after the 12-week induction dosing and if there is adequate therapeutic 
response, transition to maintenance dosing. For patients who do not achieve adequate therapeutic 
benefit at week 12 of induction dosing, mirikizumab 300 mg by intravenous infusion may be 
continued at weeks 12, 16 and 20 (extended induction therapy). If therapeutic benefit is achieved 
with the additional intravenous therapy, patients may initiate mirikizumab subcutaneous maintenance 
dosing (200 mg) every 4 weeks, starting at week 24. Mirikizumab should be discontinued in patients 
who do not show evidence of therapeutic benefit to extended induction therapy by week 24. 
Patients with loss of therapeutic response during maintenance treatment may receive 300 mg 
mirikizumab by intravenous infusion every 4 weeks, for a total of 3 doses (re-induction). If clinical 
benefit is achieved from this additional intravenous therapy, patients may resume mirikizumab 
subcutaneous dosing every 4 weeks. The efficacy and safety of repeated re-induction therapy have 
not been evaluated. 
In case of a missed dose, instruct patients to inject as soon as possible. Thereafter, resume dosing 
every 4 weeks. 
Elderly  
No dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). There is limited information in subjects aged 
≥ 75 years. 
Renal or hepatic impairment 
Omvoh has not been studied in these patient populations. These conditions are generally not 
expected to have any significant impact on the pharmacokinetics of monoclonal antibodies and no 
dose adjustments are considered necessary (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Omvoh in children and adolescents aged 2 to less than 18 years have not 
yet been established. No data are available. 
There is no relevant use of Omvoh in children below 2 years for the indication of ulcerative colitis. 
Method of administration  
For subcutaneous injection only. 
Sites for injection include the abdomen, thigh, and back of the upper arm. After training in 
subcutaneous injection technique, a patient may self-inject with mirikizumab. 
Patients should be instructed to inject in a different location every time. For example, if the first 
injection was in the abdomen, the second injection—to complete a full dose—could be in another 
area of the abdomen. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Clinically important active infections (active tuberculosis). 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
In clinical studies, hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Most were mild or moderate, 
severe reactions were uncommon (see section 4.8). If a serious hypersensitivity reaction, including 
anaphylaxis, occurs, mirikizumab must be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy must 
be initiated. 
Infections 
Mirikizumab may increase the risk of severe infection (see section 4.8). Treatment with mirikizumab 
should not be initiated in patients with a clinically important active infection until the infection 
resolves or is adequately treated (see section 4.3). The risks and benefits of treatment should be 
considered prior to initiating use of mirikizumab in patients with a chronic infection or a history of 
recurrent infection. Patients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms of 
clinically important acute or chronic infection occur. If a serious infection develops, discontinuation 
of mirikizumab should be considered until the infection resolves. 
Pre-treatment evaluation for tuberculosisPrior to initiating treatment, patients should be evaluated 
for tuberculosis (TB) infection. Patients receiving mirikizumab should be monitored for signs and 
symptoms of active TB during and after treatment. Anti-TB therapy should be considered prior to 
initiating treatment in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course 
of treatment cannot be confirmed. 
Hepatic enzyme elevations 
Cases of drug-induced liver injury (including one case meeting Hy’s Law criteria) occurred in 
patients receiving mirikizumab in clinical trials. Liver enzymes and bilirubin should be evaluated at 
baseline and monthly during induction (including extended induction period, if applicable). 
Thereafter, liver enzymes and bilirubin should be monitored (every 1 - 4 months) according to 
standard practice for patient management and as clinically indicated. If increases in alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are observed and drug-induced liver 
injury is suspected, mirikizumab must be discontinued until this diagnosis is excluded. 
Immunisations 
Prior to initiating therapy with mirikizumab, completion of all appropriate immunisations should be 
considered according to current immunisation guidelines. Avoid use of live vaccines in patients 
treated with mirikizumab. No data are available on the response to live or non-live vaccines. 
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 200 mg dose, that is to say 
essentially “sodium-free”.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
No interaction studies have been performed.  
In ulcerative colitis studies, concomitant use of corticosteroids or oral immunomodulators did not 
influence the safety of mirikizumab. 
Population pharmacokinetic data analyses indicated that the clearance of mirikizumab was not 
impacted by concomitant administration of 5-ASAs (5-aminosalicylic acid), corticosteroids or oral 
immunomodulators (azathioprine, mercaptopurine, thioguanine, and methotrexate) in patients with 
ulcerative colitis. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential should use an effective method of contraception during treatment 
and for at least 10 weeks after treatment. 
Pregnancy 
There is a limited amount of data from the use of mirikizumab in pregnant women. Animal studies 
do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see 
section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Omvoh during 
pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether mirikizumab is excreted in human milk. Human IgGs are known to be 
excreted in breast milk during the first few days after birth, which is decreasing to low 
concentrations soon afterwards; consequently, a risk to the breast-fed infant cannot be excluded 
during this short period. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to 
discontinue/abstain from Omvoh therapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the 
child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
The effect of mirikizumab on human fertility has not been evaluated (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Omvoh has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions are upper respiratory tract infections (7.9 %, most 
frequently nasopharyngitis), headache (3.3 %), rash (1.1 %) and injection site reactions (8.7 %, 
maintenance period). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions from clinical studies (Table 1) are listed by MedDRA system organ class. The 
frequency category for each reaction is based on the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); 
common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000); very 
rare (< 1/10 000).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Infusion-related hypersensitivity reactions (LUCENT-1, weeks 1-12) 
Infusion-related hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 0.4 % of mirikizumab-treated patients. 
All infusion-related hypersensitivity reactions were reported as non-serious. 
Injection site reactions (LUCENT-2, weeks 12-52) 
Injection site reactions were reported in 8.7 % mirikizumab-treated patients. The most frequent 
reactions were injection site pain, injection site reaction and injection site erythema. These symptoms 
were reported as non-serious, mild and transient in nature. 
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased 
In the first 12 weeks (LUCENT-1), ALT increased was reported in 0.4 % mirikizumab-treated 
patients. AST increased was reported by 0.5 % mirikizumab-treated patients. All adverse reactions 
were reported as mild to moderate in severity and non-serious. 
Over all mirikizumab treatment periods in the ulcerative colitis clinical development program 
(including the placebo-controlled and open label induction and maintenance periods), there have 
been elevations of ALT to ≥ 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (2.0 %), ≥ 5 x ULN (0.7 %) and 
≥ 10 x ULN (0.2 %) and AST to ≥ 3 x ULN (2.1 %), ≥ 5 x ULN (1.1 %) and ≥ 10 x ULN (0.1 %) in 
patients receiving mirikizumab (see section 4.4). These elevations have been noted with and without 
concomitant elevations in total bilirubin. 
Immunogenicity 
With 12 months of treatment, up to 23 % of mirikizumab-treated patients developed anti-drug 
antibodies, most of which were of low titer and tested positive for neutralising activity. Higher 
antibody titers in approximately 2 % of subjects treated with mirikizumab were associated with 
lower serum mirikizumab concentrations and reduced clinical response. No association was found 
between anti-mirikizumab antibodies and hypersensitivity or injection site reactions.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
Mirikizumab doses up to 2 400 mg intravenously and up to 500 mg subcutaneously have been 
administered in clinical trials without dose-limiting toxicity. In the event of overdose, the patient 
must be monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic 
treatment must be started immediately.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC24 
Mechanism of action 
Mirikizumab is a humanised IgG4 monoclonal, anti-interleukin-23 (anti-IL-23) antibody that 
selectively binds to the p19 subunit of human IL-23 cytokine and inhibits its interaction with the 
IL-23 receptor.  
IL-23, a regulatory cytokine, affects the differentiation, expansion, and survival of T cell subsets, 
(e.g., Th17 cells and Tc17 cells) and innate immune cell subsets, which represent sources of effector 
cytokines, including IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-22 that drive inflammatory disease. In humans, selective 
blockade of IL-23 was shown to normalise production of these cytokines. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Inflammatory biomarkers were measured in the phase 3 ulcerative colitis studies. Mirikizumab 
administered intravenously every 4 weeks during induction dosing significantly reduced levels of 
fecal calprotectin and C-reactive protein from baseline to week 12. Also, mirikizumab administered 
subcutaneously every 4 weeks during maintenance dosing sustained significantly reduced levels of 
fecal calprotectin and C-reactive protein through 40 weeks. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy and safety of mirikizumab was evaluated in adult patients with moderately to severely 
active ulcerative colitis in two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre studies. 
Enrolled patients had a confirmed diagnosis of ulcerative colitis for at least 3 months and moderately 
to severely active disease, defined as a modified Mayo score of 4 to 9, including a Mayo endoscopy 
subscore ≥ 2. Patients had to have failed (defined as loss of response, inadequate response or 
intolerance) corticosteroids or immunomodulators (6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine) or at least one 
biologic (a TNFα antagonist and/or vedolizumab) or tofacitinib. 
LUCENT-1 was an intravenous induction study with treatment of up to 12 weeks, followed by a 
40 week subcutaneous randomised withdrawal maintenance study (LUCENT-2), representing at least 
52 weeks of therapy. Mean age was 42.5 years. 7.8 % of patients were ≥ 65 of age and 1.0 % of 
patients ≥ 75 of age. 59.8 % were men; 40.2 % were women. 53.2 % had severely active disease with 
a modified Mayo score 7 to 9. 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Efficacy results presented for LUCENT-1 and LUCENT-2 were based on central reading of 
endoscopies and histology. 
LUCENT-1  
LUCENT-1 included 1 162 patients in the primary efficacy population. Patients were randomised to 
receive a dose of 300 mg mirikizumab via intravenous infusion or placebo, at week 0, week 4 and 
week 8 with a 3:1 treatment allocation ratio. The primary endpoint for the induction study was the 
proportion of subjects in clinical remission [modified Mayo score (MMS) defined as: Stool 
frequency (SF) subscore = 0 or 1 with a ≥ 1-point decrease from baseline, and rectal bleeding (RB) 
subscore = 0, and Endoscopic subscore (ES) = 0 or 1 (excluding friability)] at week 12. 
Patients in these studies may have received other concomitant therapies including 
aminosalicylates (74.3 %), immunomodulatory agents (24.1 % such as azathioprine, 
6-mercaptopurine or methotrexate), and oral corticosteroids (39.9 %; prednisone daily dose up to 
20 mg or equivalent) at a stable dose prior to and during the induction period. Per protocol oral 
corticosteroids were tapered after induction.  
Of the primary efficacy population, 57.1 % were biologic-naive and tofacitinib-naive. 41.2 % of 
patients had failed a biologic or tofacitinib. 36.3 % of the patients had failed at least 1 prior anti-TNF 
therapy, 18.8 % had failed vedolizumab and 3.4 % of patients had failed tofacitinib. 20.1 % had 
failed more than one biologic or tofacitinib. An additional 1.7 % had previously received but had not 
failed a biologic or tofacitinib. 
In LUCENT-1 a significantly greater proportion of patients were in clinical remission in the 
mirikizumab treated group compared to placebo at week 12 (Table 2). As early as week 2, 
mirikizumab-treated patients achieved a greater reduction in RB subscores and decreases in SF 
subscores.

LUCENT-2  
LUCENT-2 evaluated 544 patients out of the 551 patients who achieved clinical response with 
mirikizumab in LUCENT-1 at week 12 (see Table 2). Patients were re-randomised in a 2:1 treatment 
allocation ratio to receive a subcutaneous maintenance regimen of 200 mg mirikizumab or placebo 
every 4 weeks for 40 weeks (which is 52 weeks from initiation of the induction dose). The primary 
endpoint for the maintenance study was the proportion of subjects in clinical remission (same 
definition as in LUCENT-1) at week 40. Corticosteroid tapering was required upon entrance into 
LUCENT-2 for patients who were receiving corticosteroids during LUCENT-1. Significantly greater 
proportions of patients were in clinical remission in the mirikizumab-treated group compared to the 
placebo group at week 40 (see Table 3).

The efficacy and safety profile of mirikizumab was consistent across subgroups, i.e. age, gender, 
body weight, disease activity severity at baseline and region. The effect size may vary. 
At week 40, a greater proportion of patients were in clinical response (defined as decrease in the 
MMS of ≥ 2 points and ≥ 30 % decrease from baseline, and a decrease of ≥ 1 point in the RB 
subscore from baseline or a RB score of 0 or 1) in the mirikizumab responder group re-randomised 
to mirikizumab (80 %) compared to the mirikizumab responder group re-randomised to placebo 
(49 %). 
Week 24 responders to mirikizumab extended induction (LUCENT-2) 
For the mirikizumab patients who were not in response at week 12 of LUCENT-1 and received 
open-label additional 3 doses of 300 mg mirikizumab IV every 4 weeks (Q4W) 53.7 % achieved 
clinical response at week 12 of LUCENT-2 and 52.9 % mirikizumab patients continued to 
maintenance receiving 200 mg mirikizumab Q4W SC, and among these patients 72.2 % achieved 
clinical response and 36.1 % achieved clinical remission at week 40. 
Recapture of efficacy after loss of response to mirikizumab maintenance (LUCENT-2) 
19 patients who experienced a first loss of response (5.2 %) between week 12 and 28 of LUCENT-2 
received open label mirikizumab rescue dosing with 300 mg mirikizumab Q4W IV for 3 doses and 
12 of these patients (63.2 %) achieved symptomatic response and 7 patients (36.8 %) achieved 
symptomatic remission after 12 weeks. 
Endoscopic normalisation at week 40 
Normalisation of endoscopic appearance of the mucosa was defined as a Mayo endoscopic subscore 
of 0. At week 40 of LUCENT-2, endoscopic normalisation was achieved in 81/365 (22.2 %) of 
patients treated with mirikizumab and in 24/179 (13.4 %) of patients in placebo group. 
Histologic outcomes 
At week 12 greater proportions of patients in the mirikizumab group achieved histologic 
improvement (39.2 %) compared with patients in the placebo group (20.7 %). At week 40 histologic 
remission was observed with more patients in the mirikizumab group (48.5 %) as compared to 
placebo (24.6 %). 
Stable maintenance of symptomatic remission 
Stable maintenance of symptomatic remission was defined as the proportion of patients in 
symptomatic remission for at least 7 out of 9 visits from week 4 to week 36 and in symptomatic 
remission at week 40 among patients in symptomatic remission and clinical response at week 12 of 
LUCENT-1. At week 40 of LUCENT-2, the proportion of patients achieving stable maintenance of 
symptomatic remission was greater in patients treated with mirikizumab (69.7 %) versus placebo 
(38.4 %). 
Health-related quality of life 
At week 12 of LUCENT-1, patients receiving mirikizumab showed significantly greater clinically 
relevant improvements on the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) total score 
(p ≤ 0.001) when compared to placebo. IBDQ response was defined as at least a 16-point 
improvement from baseline in IBDQ score and IBDQ remission was defined as a score of at 
least 170. At week 12 of LUCENT-1, 57.5 % of mirikizumab-treated patients achieved IBDQ 
remission versus 39.8 % with placebo (p < 0.001) and 72.7 % of mirikizumab-treated patients 
achieved IBDQ response versus 55.8 % in placebo. In LUCENT-2 at week 40, 72.3 % of 
mirikizumab-treated patients achieved maintenance of IBDQ remission versus 43.0 % placebo 
treated patients and 79.2 % mirikizumab treated patients achieved IBDQ response versus 49.2 % of 
placebo treated patients. 
Patient reported outcomes 
Decreases in bowel urgency severity were observed as early as week 2 in patients treated with 
mirikizumab in LUCENT-1. Patients receiving mirikizumab achieved significant bowel urgency 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
remission compared with patients in the placebo group at week 12 in LUCENT 1 (22.1 % vs 
12.3 %), and week 40 in LUCENT-2 (42.9 % vs 25 %). Patients receiving mirikizumab showed 
significant improvements in fatigue as early as week 2 of LUCENT-1 and the improvements were 
maintained at week 40 of LUCENT-2. As early as week 4 there was also a significantly greater 
reduction in abdominal pain. 
Hospitalisations and ulcerative colitis related surgeries 
Through week 12 of LUCENT-1, the proportion of patients with UC-related hospitalisations were 
0.3 % (3/868) in the mirikizumab and 3.4 % (10/294) in the placebo group. UC-related surgeries 
were reported in 0.3 % (3/868) patients receiving mirikizumab and 0.7 % (2/294) patients in the 
placebo group. There were no UC-related hospitalisations and no UC-related surgeries in 
LUCENT-2 in the mirikizumab arm.  
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Omvoh in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of ulcerative colitis (see 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
There was no apparent accumulation in serum mirikizumab concentration over time when given 
subcutaneously every 4 weeks. 
Mean (coefficient variation [CV %]) Cmax and area under the curve (AUC) after induction dosing 
(300 mg every 4 weeks administered by intravenous infusion) in patients with ulcerative colitis were 
99.7 (22.7) µg/mL and 538 (34.4) µg*day/mL, respectively. The mean (CV %) Cmax and AUC after 
maintenance dosing (200 mg every 4 weeks by subcutaneous injection) were 10.1 (52.1) µg/mL and 
160 (57.6) µg*day/mL, respectively. 
Absorption 
Following subcutaneous dosing of mirikizumab, peak serum concentrations were achieved 2-3 days 
post dose with an estimated absolute bioavailability of 44 %. 
Injection site location did not significantly influence absorption of mirikizumab. 
Distribution 
The mean total volume of distribution was 4.83 L. 
Biotransformation 
Mirikizumab is a humanised IgG4 monoclonal antibody and is expected to be degraded into small 
peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgGs. 
Elimination 
In the population PK analysis, mean apparent clearance was 0.0229 L/hr and the mean elimination 
half-life is approximately 9.3 days in patients with ulcerative colitis. Clearance is independent of 
dose. 
Dose proportionality 
Mirikizumab exhibited linear pharmacokinetics with dose-proportional increase in exposure over a 
dose range of 5 to 2 400 mg given as an intravenous infusion or over a dose range of 120 to 400 mg 
given as a subcutaneous injection in patients with ulcerative colitis or in healthy volunteers.

Special populations 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that age, sex, weight, or race/ethnicity did not have a 
clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of mirikizumab (see also section 4.8, 
“immunogenicity”). Among the 1 362 subjects with ulcerative colitis exposed to mirikizumab in 
Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies, 99 (7.3 %) patients were 65 years or older and 11 (0.8 %) patients were 
75 years or older. 
Renal or hepatic impairment 
Specific clinical pharmacology studies to evaluate the effects of renal impairment and hepatic 
impairment on the pharmacokinetics of mirikizumab have not been conducted. Population 
pharmacokinetic analysis showed that creatinine clearance (range of 36.2 to 291 mL/min) or total 
bilirubin (range of 1.5 to 29 µmol/L) did not affect mirikizumab pharmacokinetics. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, toxicity to reproduction and development. 
Carcinogenesis / mutagenesis 
Non-clinical studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of 
mirikizumab. 
Impairment of fertility 
No reproductive organ weight or histopathology effects were observed in sexually mature 
cynomolgus monkeys that received mirikizumab once weekly for 26 weeks, at a dose of 100 mg/kg 
(at least 30 times the human maintenance dose).

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Omvoh is and what it is used for 
Omvoh contains the active substance mirikizumab, a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies 
are proteins that recognise and bind specifically to certain target proteins in the body. Omvoh works 
by attaching to and blocking a protein in the body called IL-23 (interleukin-23), which is involved in 
inflammation. By blocking the action of IL-23, Omvoh reduces inflammation and other symptoms 
associated with ulcerative colitis. 
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the large bowel. If you have ulcerative colitis, 
you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough or cannot tolerate these 
medicines, you may be given Omvoh to reduce signs and symptoms of ulcerative colitis such as 
diarrhoea, abdominal pain, urgency and rectal bleeding. 
2.  What you need to know before you receive Omvoh 
Do not use Omvoh  
- 
- 
if you are allergic to mirikizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). If you think you may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice before using Omvoh. 
If you have important active infections (active tuberculosis). 
Warnings and precautions 
•  Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using this medicine.  
•  Your doctor will check how well you are before treatment.  
•  Make sure you tell your doctor about any illness you have before treatment.  
54 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Infections 
•  Omvoh can potentially cause serious infections.  
•  Treatment with Omvoh should not be started if you have an active infection until the infection is 
gone.

o  chills 
o  muscle aches 
o  cough 
o  shortness of breath 
runny nose 
o 
o  sore throat 
o  pain during urination 
•  Also tell your doctor if you have recently been near anyone who might have tuberculosis.  
•  Your doctor will examine you and may do a test for tuberculosis before you have Omvoh.  
• 
If your doctor thinks you are at risk of an active tuberculosis, you may be given medicines to treat 
it. 
Vaccinations 
Your doctor will check to see if you need any vaccinations before starting treatment. Tell your 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you have recently had or are going to have a vaccination. Some types 
of vaccines (live vaccines) should not be given while using Omvoh. 
Allergic reactions 
•  Omvoh can potentially cause serious allergic reactions. 
•  Stop using Omvoh and get emergency medical help right away if you develop any of the 
following symptoms of a serious allergic reaction:

o 
o  swelling of the face, lips, mouth, tongue 
or throat, trouble breathing 
o  sensation of throat tightening or chest 
tightness. 
Liver blood test 
Your doctor will conduct blood tests before starting and during treatment with Omvoh to check if 
your liver is functioning normally. If blood tests are abnormal, your doctor might interrupt therapy 
with Omvoh and do additional tests on your liver to determine the cause. 
Children and adolescents 
Omvoh is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age because it has not 
been studied in this age group. 
Other medicines and Omvoh 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse

vaccines) should not be given while using Omvoh. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for 
advice before using this medicine. It is preferable to avoid the use of Omvoh in pregnancy. The 
effects of Omvoh in pregnant women are not known. If you are a woman of childbearing potential, 
you are advised to avoid becoming pregnant and should use effective contraception while using Omvoh

Driving and using machines  
Omvoh is unlikely to influence your ability to drive and use machines. 
Omvoh contains sodium 
This medicine contains 60 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 300 mg dose. 
This is equivalent to 3 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. 
Before Omvoh is given to you, it is mixed with a solution that might contain sodium. Talk to your 
doctor if you are on a low salt diet. 
3.  How Omvoh is used 
Omvoh is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a doctor experienced in the 
diagnosis and treatment of ulcerative colitis. 
How much Omvoh is given and for how long 
Your doctor will decide how much Omvoh you need and for how long. Omvoh is for long-term 
treatment. Your doctor or nurse will regularly monitor your condition to check that the treatment is 
having the desired effect. 
• 
• 
Treatment start: The first dose of Omvoh is 300 mg and will be given by your doctor by 
intravenous infusion (drip in a vein in your arm) over at least 30 minutes. After the first dose, 
you will receive another dose of Omvoh 300 mg 4 weeks later and again after an additional 
4 weeks. 
If you do not have adequate therapeutic response after these 3 infusions, your doctor might 
consider continuing intravenous infusions at weeks 12, 16 and 20. 
Maintenance therapy: 4 weeks after the last intravenous infusion, a maintenance dose of 
Omvoh 200 mg will be given by an injection under the skin (‘subcutaneously’) and then every 
4 weeks. The maintenance dose of 200 mg will be given by using 2 injections each containing 
100 mg of Omvoh. 
If you lose response after receiving the maintenance dose of Omvoh, your doctor may decide 
to give you 3 doses of Omvoh by intravenous infusions. 
Your doctor or nurse will tell you when to switch to subcutaneous injections. 
During maintenance therapy you and your doctor or nurse should decide if you should inject 
Omvoh yourself after training in subcutaneous injection technique. It is important not to try to 
inject yourself until you have been trained by your doctor or nurse. Your doctor or nurse will 
offer the necessary training. 
If you receive more Omvoh than you should  
If you have received more Omvoh than you should or the dose has been given sooner than prescribed, 
inform your doctor. 
If you forget to use Omvoh  
If you missed a dose of Omvoh, talk to your doctor. 
If you stop using Omvoh  
You should not stop using Omvoh without speaking to your doctor first. If you stop treatment, 
symptoms of ulcerative colitis may come back. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

• 
Treatment start: The first dose of Omvoh is 300 mg and will be given by your doctor by

Disposing of Omvoh syringe 
Throw away the used syringe 
• Put the used syringe in a sharps disposal 
container right away after use. Do not 
throw the syringe directly into your 
household waste. 
• If you do not have a sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is:

– can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, 
– upright and stable during use, 
– leak-resistant, 
– properly labelled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. 
• When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community 
guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be local laws 
about how you should throw away needles and syringes. 
• Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container. 
• For more information on how to dispose of the container properly, ask your healthcare provider 
about options available in your area.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Omvoh is and what it is used for 
Omvoh contains the active substance mirikizumab, a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies 
are proteins that recognise and bind specifically to certain target proteins in the body. Omvoh works 
by attaching to and blocking a protein in the body called IL-23 (interleukin-23), which is involved in 
inflammation. By blocking the action of IL-23, Omvoh reduces inflammation and other symptoms 
associated with ulcerative colitis. 
Ulcerative colitis is a  chronic inflammatory disease of the large bowel. If you have ulcerative colitis, 
you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough or cannot tolerate these 
medicines, you may be given Omvoh to reduce signs and symptoms of ulcerative colitis such as 
diarrhoea, abdominal pain, urgency and rectal bleeding. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Omvoh 
Do not use Omvoh  
- 
- 
if you are allergic to mirikizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). If you think you may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice before using Omvoh. 
If you have important active infections (active tuberculosis). 
Warnings and precautions 
•  Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using this medicine.  
•  Your doctor will check how well you are before treatment.  
•  Make sure you tell your doctor about any illness you have before treatment.  
73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Infections 
•  Omvoh can potentially cause serious infections. Treatment with Omvoh should not be started if 
you have an active infection until the infection is gone. 
•  After starting the treatment, tell your doctor right away if you have any symptoms of an 
infection such as: 
fever 
o 
o  chills 
o  muscle aches 
o  cough 
o  shortness of breath 
runny nose 
o 
o  sore throat 
o  pain during urination 
•  Also tell your doctor if you have recently been near anyone who might have tuberculosis.  
•  Your doctor will examine you and may do a test for tuberculosis before you have Omvoh.  
• 
If your doctor thinks you are at risk of an active tuberculosis, you may be given medicines to 
treat it. 
Vaccinations 
Your doctor will check to see if you need any vaccinations before starting treatment. Tell your 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you have recently had or are going to have a vaccination. Some types 
of vaccines (live vaccines) should not be given while using Omvoh. 
Allergic reactions 
•  Omvoh can potentially cause serious allergic reactions. 
•  Stop using Omvoh and get emergency medical help right away if you develop any of the 
following symptoms of a serious allergic reaction:

rash 
fainting 
o  dizziness 
low blood pressure 
o 
o  swelling of the face, lips, mouth, tongue 
or throat, trouble breathing 
o  sensation of throat tightening or chest 
tightness. 
Liver blood test 
Your doctor will conduct blood tests before starting and during treatment with Omvoh to check if 
your liver is functioning normally. If blood tests are abnormal, your doctor might interrupt therapy 
with Omvoh and do additional tests on your liver to determine the cause. 
Children and adolescents 
Omvoh is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age because it has not 
been studied in this age group. 
Other medicines and Omvoh 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse  
- 
- 
if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
if you have recently had or are going to have a vaccination. Some types of vaccines (live 
vaccines) should not be given while using Omvoh. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for 
advice before using this medicine. It is preferable to avoid the use of Omvoh in pregnancy. The 
effects of Omvoh in pregnant women are not known. If you are a woman of childbearing potential, 
you are advised to avoid becoming pregnant and should use effective contraception while using Omvoh 
and for at least 10 weeks after the last Omvoh dose. 
If you are breast-feeding or are planning to breast-feed, talk to your doctor before using this 
medicine.

3. 
How to use Omvoh 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or nurse has told you. Check with your doctor, 
nurse or pharmacist if you are not sure how to use this medicine. 
How much Omvoh is given and for how long 
Your doctor will decide how much Omvoh you need and for how long. Omvoh is for long-term 
treatment. Your doctor or nurse will regularly monitor your condition to check that the treatment is 
having the desired effect. 
• 
• 
Treatment start: The first dose of Omvoh is 300 mg and will be given by your doctor by 
intravenous infusion (drip in a vein in your arm) over at least 30 minutes. After the first dose, 
you will receive another dose of Omvoh 300 mg 4 weeks later and again after an additional 
4 weeks. 
If you do not have adequate therapeutic response after these 3 infusions, your doctor might 
consider continuing intravenous infusions at weeks 12, 16 and 20. 
Maintenance therapy: 4 weeks after the last intravenous infusion, a maintenance 
dose of Omvoh 200 mg will be given by an injection under the skin 
(‘subcutaneously’) and then every 4 weeks. The maintenance dose of 200 mg will be 
given by using 2 injections each containing 100 mg of Omvoh. 
If you lose response after receiving the maintenance dose of Omvoh, your doctor 
may decide to give you 3 doses of Omvoh by intravenous infusions. 
Your doctor or nurse will tell you when to switch to subcutaneous injections. 
During maintenance therapy you and your doctor or nurse should decide if you 
should inject Omvoh yourself after training in subcutaneous injection technique. It is 
important not to try to inject yourself until you have been trained by your doctor or 
nurse. Your doctor or nurse will offer the necessary training. 
A caregiver may also give you your Omvoh injection after proper training. 
Use a reminder method such as notes in a calendar or diary to help you remember when to 
take your next dose so that you avoid missing or repeating doses. 
If you receive more Omvoh than you should  
If you have received more Omvoh than you should or the dose has been given sooner than prescribed, 
inform your doctor. 
If you forget to use Omvoh  
If you have forgotten to inject a dose of Omvoh, inject as soon as possible. Thereafter, resume dosing 
every 4 weeks. 
If you stop using Omvoh  
You should not stop using Omvoh without speaking to your doctor first. If you stop treatment, 
symptoms of ulcerative colitis may come back. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Preparing to inject Omvoh 
Take the pens from the refrigerator 
Gather supplies 
Inspect the pens and the medicine 
Expiry date 
Prepare for injection  
Choose your injection site  
Back of arm 
Abdomen 
Thigh 
Take 2 Omvoh pens from the refrigerator. 
Leave the grey base caps on until you are ready to 
inject. 
Leave the pens at room temperature for 30 minutes before 
injecting. 
Do not microwave the pens, run hot water over them, or 
leave them in direct sunlight.  
Do not use the pens if the medicine is frozen.  
Do not shake. 
Supplies:  
• 2  alcohol wipes  
• 2 cotton balls or pieces of gauze 
• 1 sharps container (see “Disposing of Omvoh pens”) 
Make sure you have the right medicine. The medicine 
inside should be clear. It may be colourless to slightly 
yellow. 
Do not use the pens, and dispose of as directed by your 
healthcare provider if:  
• it looks damaged 
• the medicine is cloudy, is discoloured, or has particles 
• the expiry date printed on the label has passed 
• the medicine is frozen 
Wash your hands with soap and water before you inject 
Omvoh.  
Your healthcare provider can help you choose the injection 
site that is best for you. 
•  You or another person may inject the medicine into 
your stomach area (abdomen). Do not inject within 
5 centimetres of the belly button (navel). 
•  You or another person may inject the medicine in the 
front of your thighs. This area should be at least 
5 centimetres above the knee and 5 centimetres below the 
groin. 
•  Another person may give you the injection in the back of 
your upper arm. 
•  Do not inject in the exact same spot every time. For 
example, if your first injection was in your abdomen, your 
second injection - to complete a full dose - could be in 
another spot in your abdomen. 
•  Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, 
red or hard. 
Clean the injection site with an alcohol wipe. Let the 
injection site dry before you inject your medicine.

Disposing of Omvoh pens 
Throw away the used pens 
• Put the used pen in a sharps disposal container right 
away after use. Do not throw the pen directly into 
your household waste. 
• If you do not have a sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: 
– made of a heavy-duty plastic, 
– can be closed with a tight fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, 
– upright and stable during use, 
– leak-resistant, 
– properly labelled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. 
• When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community 
guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be local laws 
about how you should throw away needles and syringes. 
• Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container. 
• For more information on how to dispose of the container properly, ask your healthcare provider 
about options available in your area. 
Commonly asked questions 
Q. What if I let my pens warm up for longer than 30 minutes before injecting? 
A. Your pen can stay at room temperature up to 30 °C for up to 2 weeks. 
Q. What if I see air bubbles in the pen? 
A. It is normal to have air bubbles in the pen. They will not harm you or affect your dose. 
Q. What if there is a drop of liquid on the tip of the needle when I remove the grey base cap? 
A. It is okay to see a drop of liquid on the tip of the needle. This will not harm you or affect your 
dose. 
Q. What if I unlocked the pen and pressed the blue injection button down until the injection is 
complete? 
A. Do not remove the grey base cap. Do not use the pen. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist to get a 
new one. 
Q. Do I need to hold the blue injection button down until the injection is complete? 
A. You do not need to hold the blue injection button down, but it may help you keep the pen steady 
and firm against your skin. 
Q. What if the needle did not retract after my injection? 
A. Do not touch the needle or replace the grey base cap. Store the pen in a safe place to avoid an 
accidental needlestick and contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Q. What if there is a drop of liquid or blood on my skin after my injection? 
83 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A. This is normal. Press a cotton ball or gauze over the injection site. Do not rub the injection site. 
Q. What if I heard more than 2 clicks during my injection – 2 loud clicks and a soft one. Did I 
get my complete injection? 
A. Some patients may hear a soft click right before the second loud click. That is the normal 
operation of the pen. Do not remove the pen from your skin until you hear the second loud click. 
Q. How can I tell if my injection is complete? 
A. After you press the blue injection button, you will hear 2 loud clicks. The second loud click tells 
you that your injection is complete. You will also see the grey plunger at the top of the clear base.

1.  Introduction 
On 28 November 2023, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study B7471027 for Prevenar 13, in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study B7471027,  A Phase 3, Randomized, Partially Double-Blind Trial to Evaluate 
the Safety and Immunogenicity of 20-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine in Healthy Toddlers 12 
Through 23 Months of Age With 2 Prior Infant Doses of Prevenar 13 is part of a clinical development 
program.  
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
13vPnC is a sterile liquid suspension formulation containing saccharides from pneumococcal serotypes 
1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F individually conjugated to CRM197. The vaccine 
is formulated to contain 2.2 µg of each saccharide, except for 4.4 µg of 6B, per 0.5-mL dose. The 
vaccine contains 295 μg succinate buffer, 0.85% sodium chloride, 100 μg polysorbate 80, and 125 µg 
aluminum as aluminum phosphate, per 0.5-mL dose. 
The 13vPnC supply was considered representative of Prevenar 13, as it was manufactured according to 
the approved Prevenar 13 commercial drug product process using commercially released vaccine drug 
substances. 
The current EU-approved indications for the use of 13vPnC are: 
• Active immunisation for the prevention of invasive disease, pneumonia and acute otitis media caused 
by Streptococcus pneumoniae in infants, children, and adolescents from 6 weeks to 17 years of age; 
• Active immunisation for the prevention of invasive disease and pneumonia caused by Streptococcus 
pneumoniae in adults ≥18 years of age and the elderly. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: B7471027; Final Report – A Phase 3, Randomized, Partially 
Double-Blind Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of 20-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate 
Vaccine in Healthy Toddlers 12 Through 23 Months of Age With 2 Prior Infant Doses of Prevenar 13, in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006.  
2.3.2.  Clinical study B7471027 
Description 
This Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, partially double-blind study was conducted at investigator sites 
in Europe. The purpose of this study is to describe the safety and immunogenicity of 1 or 2 doses of 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

20vPnC administered to toddlers ≥12 to <24 months of age who have received 2 doses of 13vPnC in 
infancy (prior to 12 months of age and >56 days prior to vaccination in this study). 
Approximately 360 toddlers were planned to be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 
either 1 or 2 doses of 20vPnC or 1 dose of 13vPnC (control). Toddlers randomized to receive 1 dose 
were double-blinded, as 20vPnC and 13vPnC have the same appearance and a single dose was 
administered at Visit 1 (Day 1) of the study. For participants randomized to receive 2 doses of 20vPnC, 
the parents/legal guardians and site staff were aware of the randomization assignment for these 
participants, as the participant needed to return for a second vaccination visit and an additional visit 1 
month after Dose 2 these participants received 20vPnC at both Visit 1 and Visit 2 (2 months after Visit 
1). 
Methods 
Study participants 
Key inclusion criteria were as follows: 
•  Healthy male and female toddlers determined by clinical assessment (including medical history 
and clinical judgment) and at ≥12 to <24 months of age at the time of consent (the day of 
birth is considered day of life 1). 
Key exclusion criteria were as follows: 
•  History of severe adverse reaction associated with a vaccine and/or severe allergic reaction 
(eg, anaphylaxis) to any component of investigational product or any diphtheria toxoid–
containing vaccine. 
•  Significant neurological disorder or history of seizure (excluding febrile seizure) or significant 
stable or evolving disorders such as cerebral palsy, encephalopathy, hydrocephalus, or other 
significant disorders. 
•  Major known congenital malformation or serious chronic disorder. 
•  Known or suspected immunodeficiency or other conditions associated with immunosuppression, 
including, but not limited to, immunoglobulin class/subclass deficiencies, DiGeorge syndrome, 
general zed malignancy, HIV infection, leukaemia, lymphoma, or organ or bone marrow 
transplant. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics of sex, race, ethnicity, country, and age for the safety 
population were generally similar in the 20vPnC and 13vPnC groups. Overall, the majority of the 
study population was White (98.3%) and non-Hispanic/non-Latino (71.1%), with a median age of 
12.0 months at Dose 1. Demographic characteristics for the evaluable immunogenicity population are 
similar to those for the safety population. 
Treatments 
Participants received a single dose (0.5 mL) of 20vPnC or 13vPnC intramuscularly into the anterolateral 
thigh muscle of the left leg or left arm (as appropriate for the age and size of the toddler) at each 
vaccination visit.

Objective(s) 
Study objectives, estimands, and endpoints are provided in in the following table. 
Sample size 
Approximately 360 toddlers were planned to be enrolled and randomized. The number of participants 
randomized and who received Dose 1 was 356 and 116 (95.9%) participants who were randomized to 
the 2-dose 20vPnC group received Dose 2. The numbers of participants included in the all-available 
and the evaluable immunogenicity populations were generally similar in the 3 vaccine groups with 327 
in the all-available immunogenicity population, and 318 in the evaluable population. There were 356 
participants included in the safety population.

Statistical Methods 
The primary safety objectives were evaluated by descriptive summary statistics for local reactions, 
systemic events and AEs (including SAEs). AEs were categorized according to the Medical Dictionary 
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). A 3-tier approach was used to summarize AEs. 
The primary pneumococcal immunogenicity objectives were evaluated by descriptive summary 
statistics for each of the 7 additional serotypes in 20vPnC. Other secondary and exploratory 
immunogenicity objectives were evaluated by descriptive summary statistics. 
The overall study design, objectives, endpoints and evaluation methods are considered appropriate. 
Results 
Safety results 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The percentages of participants with local reactions were similar in the 2-dose 20vPnC, 1-dose 
20vPnC, and 13vPnC control groups. Pain at injection site was the most frequently reported 
local reaction in the 2-dose 20vPnC group while redness was the most frequently reported local 
reaction in the 1-dose 20vPnC and 13vPnC (control) groups. Most local reactions were mild or 
moderate in severity with a median duration of 1 to 3 days. 
The percentages of participants with systemic events were similar in the 2-dose 20vPnC, 1-
dose 20vPnC and 13vPnC (control) groups. Irritability was the most frequently reported 
systemic event in all groups. Most systemic events were mild or moderate in severity with a 
median duration of 1 to 2 days. 
The percentage of participants with AEs from last vaccination to 1 month after last vaccination 
were similar in the 2-dose (22.4%), 1-dose 20vPnC (24.6%), and 13vPnC (25.6%) contr ol 
groups. All AEs were assessed as not related to study intervention by the investigators.  
The percentage of participants with SAEs from last vaccination to 1 month after vaccination 
were low and similar in the 2-dose 20vPnC, 1-dose 20vPnC, and 13vPnC (control) groups. Most 
SAEs reported were consistent with medical events that may occur in this population, and all 
SAEs were assessed by the investigator as not related to study intervention. 
The CHMP agrees on MAH summary on safety and for 13vPnC. Overall, no new safety concerns 
detected in participants receiving IM 13vPnC. 
Immunogenicity Results 
• 
• 
• 
In the 2-dose 20vPnC group, ≥91.2% of participants had an IgG concentration greater than or 
equal to the predefined serotype-specific IgG concentrations for each of the 7 additional serotypes. 
In the 1-dose 20vPnC group, ≥75.9% of participants had an IgG concentration greater than or 
equal to the predefined serotype-specific IgG concentrations for each of the 7 additional serotypes, 
except for serotype 12F (54.6%). 
The percentages of participants with predefined serotype-specific IgG concentrations for the 13 
matched serotypes 1 month after 1 or 2 doses of 20vPnC were similar to those after 13vPnC.  
The observed IgG GMCs 1 month after last vaccination for the 7 additional serotypes were higher in 
the 2-dose 20vPnC group than the 1-dose 20vPnC group.

• 
The observed IgG GMCs 1 month after last vaccination for the 13 matched serotypes were lower in 
the 2-dose and 1-dose 20vPnC groups than in the 13vPnC group. 
The CHMP agrees on MAH summary on immunogenicity results.  
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The present study confirmed the safety of Prevenar 13 administered by the IM route. The safety 
population was small and therefore the chance to detect rare AEs and SAEs is low.  
No new safety concern is raised from this study and the benefit/risk profile of 13vPnC remains 
unchanged. 
3.  Rapporteur’s CHMP overall conclusion and 
recommendation 
  Fulfilled: 
The results of this study indicate no new safety concern. The P46 procedure is considered fulfilled.  
No regulatory action required.

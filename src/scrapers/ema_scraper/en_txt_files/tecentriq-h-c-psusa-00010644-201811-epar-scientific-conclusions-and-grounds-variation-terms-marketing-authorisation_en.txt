Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for atezolizumab, the scientific 
conclusions of the CHMP are as follows: 
A cumulative review of cases of anaphylactic reaction with atezolizumab revealed a number of cases for 
which the role of Tecentriq cannot be excluded and two cases when the reaction occurred during the first 
infusion of atezolizumab. Both patients were receiving atezolizumab in combination with chemotherapy 
and both discontinued treatment with atezolizumab permanently as a consequence and completely 
recovered following standard treatment with corticoids and/or epinephrine. Despite the lack of diagnostic 
tests, the medical review of these cases leads to the consideration of these events as anaphylaxis and an 
update to the Product Information is considered warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s)  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for atezolizumab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing atezolizumab is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied.

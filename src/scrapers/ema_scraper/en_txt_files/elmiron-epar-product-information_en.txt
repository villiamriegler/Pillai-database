CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
elmiron is indicated for the treatment of bladder pain syndrome characterized by either glomerulations 
or Hunner’s lesions in adults with moderate to severe pain, urgency and frequency of micturition (see 
section 4.4). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Adults  
The recommended dose of pentosan polysulfate sodium is 300 mg/day taken as one 100 mg capsule 
orally three times daily.  
Response to treatment with pentosan polysulfate sodium should be reassessed every 6 months. In case 
no improvement is reached 6 months after treatment initiation, treatment with pentosan polysulfate 
sodium should be stopped. In responders pentosan polysulfate sodium treatment should be continued 
chronically as long as the response is maintained. 
Special populations 
Pentosan polysulfate sodium has not been specifically studied in special patient populations like 
elderly or patients with renal or hepatic impairment (see section 4.4). No dose adjustment is 
recommended for these patients. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of pentosan polysulfate sodium in children and adolescent below 18 years has 
not been established. 
No data are available.  
Method of administration  
The capsules should be taken with water at least 1 hour before meals or 2 hours after meals. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Due to the weak anticoagulant effect of pentosan polysulfate sodium, elmiron must not be used in 
patients who actively bleed. Menstruation is no contraindication. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Bladder pain syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion and other urologic disorders should be eliminated 
by the prescriber, such as urinary tract infection or bladder cancer. 
Pentosan polysulfate sodium is a weak anticoagulant. Patients undergoing invasive procedures or 
having signs/symptoms of underlying coagulopathy or other increased risk of bleeding (due to 
treatment with other medicinal products influencing coagulation such as anticoagulants, heparin 
derivatives, thrombolytic or antiplatelet agents including acetylsalicylic acid, or nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory medicinal products (see section 4.5)) should be evaluated for haemorrhagic events. 
Patients who have a history of heparin or pentosan polysulfate sodium induced thrombocytopenia 
should be carefully monitored when treated with pentosan polysulfate sodium. 
Hepatic or renal insufficiency 
elmiron has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency. Because there is evidence 
of hepatic and renal contribution to the elimination of pentosan polysulfate sodium, hepatic or renal 
impairment may have an impact on the pharmacokinetics of pentosan polysulfate sodium. Patients 
with relevant hepatic or renal insufficiency should be carefully monitored when treated with pentosan 
polysulfate sodium. 
Rare cases of pigmentary maculopathy have been reported with use of pentosan polysulfate sodium 
(PPS), especially after long term use. Visual symptoms might include complaints of difficulty when 
reading, visual distortions, altered colour vision and/or slow adjustment to low or reduced light 
environments.  
All patients should have an ophthalmologic examination after 6 months of use of PPS for early 
detection of pigmentary maculopathy, and, if there are no pathologic findings, regularly after 5 years 
of use (or earlier, in case of visual complaints). However, in case of relevant ophthalmologic findings, 
a yearly examination should be conducted. In such situations, treatment cessation should be 
considered. 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
A study in healthy subjects revealed no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions between 
therapeutic doses of warfarin and pentosan polysulfate sodium. No further interaction studies have 
been performed. 
Due to the weak anticoagulant effect of pentosan polysulfate sodium, patients, who are concomitantly 
treated with anticoagulants, heparin derivatives, thrombolytic or antiplatelet agents including 
acetylsalicylic acid, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products should be evaluated for any 
haemorrhagic event in order to adapt the dose if needed (see section 4.4). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of pentosan polysulfate sodium in pregnant women. Animal studies 
with respect to reproductive toxicity were not conducted.   
elmiron is not recommended during pregnancy.

Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether pentosan polysulfate sodium or metabolites are excreted in human milk. 
A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded.  
Therefore, pentosan polysulfate sodium should not be used during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
No information on a potential impact of pentosan polysulfate sodium on fertility is available. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Pentosan polysulfate sodium has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The following section lists adverse events reported in the literature from clinical studies with pentosan 
polysulfate sodium. The potential relatedness between these adverse events and the treatment with 
pentosan polysulfate sodium was not discussed in the respective publications. 
The most common adverse events reported from the clinical studies are headache, dizziness and 
gastro-intestinal events like diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain and rectal bleeding.  
The adverse events reported under treatment with pentosan polysulfate sodium were comparable to 
those reported under treatment with placebo in regards to quality and quantity. 
Tabulated summary of adverse events 
Adverse  events  are  listed  below  by  MedDRA  body  system  organ  class  and  by  frequency.  Very

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In the case of an accidental overdose, patients should be evaluated for potential adverse effects of 
pentosan polysulfate sodium like gastrointestinal symptoms or bleeding. In case of adverse reactions, 
treatment might be paused until the symptoms abate and treatment should be continued at the 
recommended dose after a critical balancing of the risks thereafter.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Urologicals, other urologicals, ATC code: G04BX15. 
Mechanism of action 
The hypothetic mechanism of action of pentosan polysulfate sodium includes a local effect in the 
bladder after systemic administration and excretion into the urine by binding of glycosaminoglycans to 
the deficient mucous of the bladder. This binding of glycosaminoglycans to the bladder mucous 
reduces bacterial adherence to the inner surface of the bladder and in consequence the incidence of 
infections is reduced as well. It is hypothesized, that a potential barrier function of pentosan 
polysulfate sodium instead of the damaged urothelial mucus might play a role as well the anti-
inflammatory activity of pentosan polysulfate sodium. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
A total of four randomised placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical studies prospectively enrolling 
patients with bladder pain syndrome diagnosed via cystoscopic examination with or without bladder 
hydrodistension evaluating the efficacy of oral treatment with pentosan polysulfate sodium were 
published in scientific literature. In all of these studies, patients reported a better subjective 
improvement of bladder pain syndrome under treatment with pentosan polysulfate sodium compared 
to placebo. In three studies, the observed difference was clearly statistically significant.  
The first study was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study with a planned cross-over 
design evaluating pentosan polysulfate sodium versus placebo. Depending on which institution the 
patients attended they were treated with either 3x100 mg or 2x200 mg PPS per day. 75 patients were 
randomised into the study and 62 of those completed the study. Efficacy of treatment was evaluated 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
based on the patient reported improvement on four typical symptoms of bladder pain syndrome: pain, 
urgency, frequency, and nocturia, no primary endpoint was defined. A patient was counted as a 
responder to treatment in case a 50 % improvement compared to baseline was reported for a specific 
symptom after 3 months of treatment. An evaluation of all data generated in the study showed that for 
all four symptoms statistically significant more patients responded to pentosan polysulfate sodium 
treatment compared to placebo:

The following two studies were conducted following very comparable double-blind, randomized, 
placebo-controlled multicentre study designs. The patients in both studies were treated for three 
months with either 3x100 mg pentosan polysulfate sodium or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint 
of the study was the overall improvement as self-reported by the patient after three months of 
treatment. The patients were asked whether they felt improved overall since the start of treatment, and 
if so, whether the improvement was “slight” 25 %, “moderate “50 %, “great” 75 % or “complete cure” 
100 %. Patients who reported at least moderate (50 %) improvement were counted as responders. The 
secondary efficacy endpoints included the investigators evaluation of improvement. The used scale for 
the investigators’ assessment included the categories “worse”, “no change”, “fair”, “good”, “very 
good”, and “excellent”. A responder was defined as a patient assessed to be at least “good” compared 
to baseline. Furthermore, volume voiding profiles over three days and the impact of treatment on pain 
and urgency were evaluated as secondary endpoints. The impact on pain and urgency was evaluated 
via the same questionnaire as the primary endpoint with a responder defined as a patient experiencing 
an at least moderate (50 %) improvement compared to baseline. In addition, the impact on pain and 
urgency was evaluated via a 5-score scale, where a responder was defined as a patient experiencing at 
least a 1-point improvement compared to baseline. 
110 patients were enrolled and treated for three months in the first of the two very comparable studies. 
A statistically significant benefit of pentosan polysulfate sodium over placebo was demonstrated over 
the primary endpoint, the patients overall-assessment of improvement as well as on the investigators’ 
overall assessment. Furthermore, a trend for better efficacy of pentosan polysulfate sodium was 
observed for the patients self-assessment of an improvement of pain and urgency, despite a deviating 
effect observed for the evaluation of urgency via the scale. In addition, positive effects were observed 
on the voiding profile, although the observed differences were not statistically significant:

The fourth study was following a double-blind, double-dummy, multifactorial design and evaluated 
the effects of pentosan polysulfate sodium and hydroxyzine in one study. Patients were randomized to 
four treatment group and were treated for six months with 3x100 mg pentosan polysulfate sodium, 
1x50 mg hydroxyzine, both active treatments, or placebo. A responder analysis based on a patient-
reported Global Response Assessment (GRA) after 24 weeks of treatment was defined as primary 
endpoint. The GRA assessment was evaluated via a 7-point centred scale, in which the patients can 
assess their global response compared to baseline as markedly worse, moderately worse, slightly 
worse, no change, slightly improved, moderately improved or markedly improved. Participants who 
reported either of the latter two categories were defined as treatment responders. Secondary outcome 
measures included the O’Leary-Sant IC Symptom and Problem Index, the University of Wisconsin 
Symptom score, patient reported symptoms of pain/discomfort and urgency, and results of a 24-hour 
voiding diary. Comparison of those patients receiving pentosan polysulfate sodium with those not 
receiving pentosan polysulfate sodium (irrespective of treatment with oral hydroxyzine) revealed no 
statistically significant difference between the two group, but a trend for better efficacy was observed 
for the primary endpoint in those patients treated with pentosan polysulfate sodium (either alone or in 
combination with hydroxyzine) (20 of 59, 34 %) compared to the those patients not receiving pentosan 
polysulfate sodium, but who might receive hydroxyzine (11 of 62, 18 %, p 0.064):

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Less than 10 % of orally administered pentosan polysulfate sodium are slowly absorbed from the 
gastrointestinal tract and are available in systemic circulation in the form of unchanged pentosan 
polysulfate sodium or it’s metabolites. All studies describe very low systemic availability of 
unchanged pentosan polysulfate sodium after oral administration. Overall, the reported systemic 
bioavailability after oral administration of pentosan polysulfate sodium is below 1 %. 
Distribution 
In healthy volunteers, a single parenteral administration of radioactively labelled pentosan polysulfate 
sodium leads to a progressive up-take of total radioactivity by the liver, spleen, and kidney (50 min 
after 1 mg/kg i.v.: 60 % of the dose in the liver, 7.7 % in the spleen; 3 h post dosing: 60 % in the liver 
plus spleen, and 13 % in the bladder). 
Biotransformation 
Pentosan polysulfate sodium is metabolised extensively by desulfation in liver and spleen and 
depolymerisation in the kidney. 
Elimination 
The apparent plasma half-life of pentosan polysulfate sodium depends on the route of administration. 
While pentosan polysulfate sodium is rapidly cleared from circulation of i.v. administration, the 
apparent plasma half-life after oral administration is in the range of 24-34 hours. Accordingly, oral 
administration of pentosan polysulfate sodium 3-times daily is expected to lead to accumulation of 
pentosan polysulfate sodium over the first 7 days of administration (accumulation factor 5-6.7). 
After oral administration unabsorbed pentosan polysulfate sodium is excreted predominantly 
unchanged in the faeces. About 6 % of the administered dose of pentosan polysulfate sodium were 
excreted via urine after desulfation and depolymerisation. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional repeated dose toxicity, 
genotoxicity and long-term carcinogenicity studies. 
The effect of pentosan polysulfate sodium on reproductive and developmental toxicity has not been 
investigated.

layer.

distinctive lesions on the bladder wall and moderate to severe pain and a frequent urge to urinate.

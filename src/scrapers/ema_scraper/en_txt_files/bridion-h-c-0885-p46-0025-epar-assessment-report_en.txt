1.  Introduction 
On 03-Jul-2020, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Bridion in accordance with Article 
46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that “A Phase 4 Double-Blinded, Randomized, Active Comparator-Controlled Clinical Trial 
to  Study  the  Efficacy,  Safety  and  Pharmacokinetics  of  Sugammadex  (MK-8616)  for  Reversal  of 
Neuromuscular Blockade in Pediatric Participants" - MK-8616-089 is a stand-alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The pharmaceutical formulation used in study MK-8616-089 was 100 mg/mL solution for injection (route 
of administration: intravenous). 
The 100 mg/mL solution for injection formulation has been approved in the EU for routine reversal of 
rocuronium induced blockade in children and adolescents aged 2 to 17 years. The recommended dose is 
2  mg/kg.  According  to  the  approved  product  information,  Bridion  100  mg/mL  may  be  diluted  to 
10 mg/mL to increase the accuracy of dosing in the paediatric population. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
Study  MK-8616-089:  “A  Phase  4  Double-Blinded,  Randomized,  Active  Comparator-Controlled  Clinical 
Trial  to  Study  the  Efficacy,  Safety  and  Pharmacokinetics  of  Sugammadex  (MK-8616)  for  Reversal  of 
Neuromuscular Blockade in Pediatric Participants" 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study MK-8616-089: A Phase 4 Double-Blinded, Randomized, Active Comparator-Controlled Clinical Trial 
to  Study  the  Efficacy,  Safety  and  Pharmacokinetics  of  Sugammadex  (MK-8616)  for  Reversal  of 
Neuromuscular Blockade in Pediatric Participants 
Description 
This was a randomized, active comparator-controlled, parallel group, multisite, double-blinded trial of 
sugammadex  in  pediatric  participants  from  2  to  <17  years  of  age  for  the  reversal  of  neuromuscular 
blockade (NMB) induced by rocuronium or vecuronium. 
The study design consisted of 2 parts. Part A of the trial identified the doses of sugammadex that would 
be tested in Part B, and Part B of the trial assessed safety and efficacy parameters. 
EMA/CHMP/520724/2020  
Page 3/19 
 
  
 
 
In Part A, participants were randomized to 1 of 2 intervention groups in a 1:1 ratio to: 
•  moderate block and reversal with 2 mg/kg sugammadex; or 
• 
deep block and reversal with 4 mg/kg sugammadex 
In Part B, participants were randomized to 1 of 3 intervention groups in an overall 1:1:5 ratio to: 
•  moderate block and reversal with 2 mg/kg sugammadex; or 
•  moderate  block  and  reversal  with  neostigmine  +  glycopyrrolate  or  atropine  sulfate  [active 
control]; or 
deep block and reversal with 4 mg/kg sugammadex 
• 
Randomization  was  stratified  by  age  (2  to  <6  years,  6  to  <12  years,  and  12  to  <17  years)  and 
neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) (rocuronium or vecuronium). 
Neuromuscular transmission was monitored using the TOF-Watch® SX device and accessories. Moderate 
NMB was defined as neuromuscular recovery up to at least the reappearance of the second twitch (T2) 
following the last dose of administered NMBA. Deep NMB was defined as neuromuscular recovery having 
reached at least 1 to 2 post-tetanic counts (PTC) following the last administered dose of NMBA.

Study design 
This was a randomized, active comparator-controlled, parallel group, multisite, double-blinded trial of 
sugammadex in pediatric participants from 2 to <17 years of age for the reversal of NMB. 
EMA/CHMP/520724/2020

The trial consisted of 2 parts, Part A and Part B. Part A identified the doses of sugammadex that would 
be investigated in Part B based upon an evaluation of PK, safety, and efficacy endpoints. Part B of the 
trial assessed safety and efficacy parameters. Part A was conducted in the United States and Part B in 
Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Spain, Turkey and the United States. 
In Part A, participants were randomized to 1 of 2 intervention groups in a 1:1 ratio (moderate block and 
reversal with 2 mg/kg sugammadex or deep block and reversal with 4 mg/kg sugammadex). Once Part 
A  of  the  study  completed,  an  interim  analysis  (IA)  was  performed  (prior  to  enrollment  in  Part  B)  to 
evaluate  PK  and  safety  data  and  was  reviewed  by  a  standing  internal  Data  Monitoring  Committee 
(siDMC). The safety data was also reviewed by an external data monitoring committee (DMC). Part A PK 
and efficacy data were also submitted to the FDA for review, upon which the FDA agreed with continued 
evaluation of 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg in Part B. 
In Part B, participants were randomized to 1 of 3 intervention groups in a 1:1:5 ratio (moderate block 
and reversal with either 2 mg/kg sugammadex or 50 mcg/kg neostigmine [active control] or deep block 
and reversal with 4 mg/kg sugammadex); randomization was stratified by age (2 to <6 years, 6 to <12 
years, and 12 to <17 years) and NMBA (rocuronium or vecuronium). 
The study design and the study interventions randomization schema are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 
2, respectively.

PK samples were only collected in Part A of the study. Samples were planned to be collected at 2, 15, 
30, and 60 minutes and 4 to 6 hours following IV bolus administration of sugammadex. Depending on 
the  length  of  hospital  stay,  an  optional  PK  sample  between  10  to  12  hours  after  sugammadex 
administration could be obtained. Sugammadex PK parameters were derived using a non-compartmental 
approach in Phoenix™ (WinNonlin® 6.4). 
Study population /Sample size 
Approximately 238 participants were to be enrolled in the study. 
Main inclusion criteria were as follows: 
Male/female  participants  between  the  ages  of  2  and  <17  years  at  Visit  2  who  met  the  following  key 
criteria were eligible to participate in the study: 
1.  Categorized as ASA physical status Class 1, 2, or 3, as determined by the investigator. 
2.  Had  a  planned  non-emergent  surgical  procedure  or  clinical  situation  (e.g,  intubation)  that 
required moderate or deep NMB with either rocuronium or vecuronium. 
3.  Had a planned surgical procedure or clinical situation that would allow objective neuromuscular 
monitoring  techniques  to  be  applied  with  access  to  the  arm  for  neuromuscular  transmission 
monitoring. 
Participants were excluded from the study if any of the following key criteria were met: 
1.  Had any clinically significant condition or situation (eg, anatomical malformation that complicates 
intubation) other than the condition being studied that, in the opinion of the investigator, would 
interfere with the trial evaluations or optimal participation in the trial. 
2.  Had a neuromuscular disorder that could have affected NMB and/or trial assessments. 
3.  Dialysis-dependent or had (or was suspected of having) severe renal insufficiency. 
4.  Had or was suspected of having a family or personal history of malignant hyperthermia. 
5.  Had  received  or  was  planned  to  receive  toremifene  and/or  fusidic  acid  via  IV  administration 
within 24 hours before or within 24 hours after administration of study treatment.

Multiplicity 
Sample Size and Power 
PK: Separately for each PK parameter, individual values of CL, AUC, Cmax, and Vz, 
will be natural log-transformed and evaluated with a fixed effects model containing 
terms dose and age group. At each dose, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of geometric 
means for each parameter will be provided. Descriptive summary statistics will be 
provided for PK parameters including AUC, Cmax, dnAUC, dnCmax, CL, Vz and t½. 
Efficacy: The efficacy hypothesis will be evaluated within Part B by comparing 
sugammadex to neostigmine in the setting of moderate block using log-transformed 
time-to-recovery values via Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), adjusting for 
neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) and age. 
P-values (Tier 1 only) and 95% CI (Tier 1 and Tier 2) will be provided for between-
treatment differences in the percentage of participants with events; these analyses 
will be performed using the stratified Miettinen and Nurminen method [Miettinen, 
O. and Nurminen, M. 1985] with NMBA and age group as stratification factors. 
One interim analysis (IA) will be performed in this study to evaluate PK and safety 
data. PK and safety data will be reviewed by a standing internal Data Monitoring 
Committee (siDMC) and safety data will be reviewed by an external Data Monitoring 
Committee (eDMC). This interim analysis is summarized below 
•  Timing: When Part A has been completed, prior to the commencement of 
enrollment of Part B. 
•  Testing: IA will evaluate PK and safety data. No formal efficacy analyses are 
planned. 
No multiplicity adjustment is planned, as there is a single comparison of sugammadex 
versus neostigmine in the setting of moderate block using 1 endpoint in the primary 
efficacy hypothesis. 
The planned sample size is 238 participants, based on minimum safety database 
requirement. There will be 30 participants per treatment arm (sugammadex and 
neostigmine) in the setting of moderate block for efficacy analysis. For time to recovery 
to TOF ≥0.9, the trial has >99% power to demonstrate that sugammadex 2mg/kg is 
superior to neostigmine at an overall two-sided 5% alpha-level. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 299 participants were screened and 288 were randomized across 28 global study sites. The 
main  reasons  for  not  randomizing  participants  were  other  and  screen  failure.  Most  (>90%)  of  the 
randomized participants received study intervention and completed the study as per protocol (Table 3). 
One  participant  was  randomized  twice  into  the  study.  After  initial  enrollment,  the  participant  was 
withdrawn  from  the  study  before  receiving  study  intervention  as  efficacy  assessments  could  not  be 
performed. At a later date, this participant was randomized again, assigned a second allocation number, 
received study intervention, and completed the study intervention. 
Of 276 treated participants, 51 received sugammadex 2 mg/kg (18 from Part A, 33 from Part B), 191 
received sugammadex 4 mg/kg (22 from Part A, 169 from Part B), and 34 received neostigmine (Part B).

Table 3: Disposition of Subjects (All Randomized Subjects, Part A+B) 
Baseline data 
The  intervention  groups  were  comparably  balanced  for  all  baseline  characteristics  (Table  4).  The 
percentage  of  male  participants  in  the  overall  population  was  55.4%.  The  mean  (SD)  [range]  age  of 
participants  was  7.9  (4.4)  [2  to  16],  years.  Most  participants  were  white  (89.5%),  had  an  eGFR  of 
>90 mL/min/1.73  m2  (91.3%)  computed using  Schwartz  formula,  and  were  of  ASA  Class  1  (63.4%). 
Similar demographic and baseline characteristics were observed among the intervention groups in each 
part (A and B) of the study.

Efficacy results 
Primary efficacy endpoint (Study Part B) 
The time to recovery to a TOF ratio of ≥0.9 was statistically significantly faster (p<0.0001) in participants 
dosed with sugammadex 2 mg/kg compared to neostigmine (ratio of geometric means = 0.22, 95% CI: 
0.16, 0.32) (Table 5). The supportive analysis results were consistent with the primary analysis results. 
Based  on  Kaplan-Meier  estimates,  90.9%  (30/33)  of  participants  dosed  with  sugammadex  2  mg/kg 
recovered  to  a  TOF  ratio  of  ≥0.9  within  3  minutes  compared  with  8.8%  (3/34)  of  participants  in  the

neostigmine group (Figure 3). Similar results were observed in the intervention groups with combined 
population from Parts A and B. The time to achieve full reversal was consistent (favouring sugammadex 
2  mg/kg  as  compared  to  neostigmine)  across  the  subgroups  of  age,  NMBA,  gender,  and  region; 
consistency across race subgroups could not be evaluated as the sample size for races other than White 
was too small (Figure 4).

Figure 6: Time (minutes) to Recovery of the TOF Ratio ≥ 0.7 (All Subjects Treated) 
Tertiary/Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints 
Delayed recovery was defined as any observation of the TOF ratio to ≥ 0.9 (in the original scale) that 
was > 3 times the geometric mean recovery time of the TOF ratio to ≥ 0.9 within each treatment group. 
In combined analysis of Study, Parts A and B, the incidence of delayed recovery was 2.0%, 7.3% and 
8.8% in sugammadex 2 mg/kg, sugammadex 4 mg/kg and neostigmine + (glycopyrrolate or atropine) 
groups,  respectively.  The  most  common  potential  reasons  for  delayed  recovery  were  potential 
measurement  anomaly  due  to  suboptimal  set-up  with  high  baseline  T1  and  potential  slow  drug 
administration. 
When TOF data were pooled across Parts A and B, the results for time to recovery remained consistent 
with the primary analysis. Although no comparator existed for the reversal of deep block, sugammadex 
4 mg/kg achieved rapid and complete reversal in this setting (Table 8).

Pharmacokinetic results  
Pharmacokinetic  data  were  only  collected  in  Study  Part  A.  The  mean  (±  SE)  plasma  sugammadex 
concentration-time profiles following a single IV dose of 2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg sugammadex are shown in 
Figure 7. Given the critical interval over which drug effect is expected, a truncated postdose duration of 
0 to 60 minutes shown separately in Figure 8. 
Figure  7:  Arithmetic  Mean  (±SE)  Plasma  Concentration-Time  Profiles  of  Sugammadex 
Following a Single IV Dose of 2 mg/kg (Left Panel) or 4 mg/kg (Right Panel) Sugammadex 
Administered in Pediatric Participants (2yr to <6 yr, 6yr to <12 yr, 12 yr to <17 yr) (Inset: 
Semi-Log Scale) 
Figure  8:  Arithmetic  Mean  Plasma  Concentration-Time  Profiles of  Sugammadex  Following a 
Single IV Dose of 2 mg/kg (Left Panel) or 4 mg/kg (Right Panel) Sugammadex Administered 
in Pediatric Participants (2yr to <6 yr, 6yr to <12 yr, 12 yr to <17 yr)  – Time Scale 0  – 60 
minutes (Semi-Log Scale) 
In order to confirm the assumptions that dose-linearity and proportionality are conserved between the 
pediatric populations, the observed concentration-time data were dose-normalized with no appreciable 
differences  identified  in  each  of  the  age  categories.  CL  and  Vz  and  Vss  relationships  indicate  that  CL 
increased monotonically with age, with a similar trend for volume of distribution (Table 9, Table 10 and 
Table  11).  Body weight-normalized  CL  and  volume  of  distribution  in  children (<12  years  of  age)  was 
higher than those in adolescents and increased with decreasing age. Consequently, the elimination half-
life  was  generally  comparable  across  all  age  cohorts.  Body  weight-normalized  CL  and  volume  of 
distribution as well as elimination half-life of sugammadex for each age category were largely similar at 
both sugammadex doses, confirming dose linearity.

Safety results 
An AE was reported for most participants in each intervention group (74.9% to 97.1% of participants; 
Table  12).  The  AE  reported  most  frequently  in  all  intervention  groups  was  procedural  pain.  Other 
frequently reported AEs included bradycardia, nausea, and vomiting (Table 13).

In all, 13 of 276 (4.7%) participants experienced an AE that was determined by the investigator to be 
related to the study drug (Table 14). Across all treatment groups, bradycardia was the most frequently 
reported  AE  considered  to  be  drug-related  (10  out  of  13  participants).  There  were  no  serious  drug-
related AEs and no subject discontinued due to a drug-related AE.

Events of clinical interest (ECI) for this trial included the following: 
•  hypersensitivity and/or anaphylaxis 
• 
clinically  relevant  bradycardia  defined  as  bradycardia  necessitating  intervention,  as 
determined by investigator judgment 
•  drug-induced liver injury 
Clinically relevant bradycardia within 7 days post-treatment was reported in 1 of 51 (2.0%), 3 of 191 
(1.6%)  and  2  of  34  (5.9%)  participants  in  sugammadex  2  mg/kg,  sugammadex  4  mg/kg  and 
neostigmine + (glycopyrrolate or atropine) group, respectively. No cases of hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis 
or potential drug-induced liver injury was reported at any time point. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Bridion is approved for routine reversal of rocuronium-induced blockade in children and adolescents aged 
2 to 17 years. The recommended dosing time in children and adolescents (2-17 years) is at reappearance 
of T2 and the recommended dose is 2 mg/kg. The recommended posology is based on one clinical study 
in the paediatric population. In adults, the recommended dose for routine NMB reversal is 4 mg/kg if 
recovery  has  reached  at  least  1-2  post-tetanic  counts  following  rocuronium  or  vecuronium  induced 
blockade or 2 mg/kg if spontaneous recovery has occurred up to at least the reappearance of T2 following 
rocuronium or vecuronium induced blockade. In addition, if there is a clinical need for immediate reversal 
following  administration  of  rocuronium  a  dose  of  16  mg/kg  sugammadex  is  recommended  in  adults. 
Immediate  reversal  in  children  and  adolescents  has  not  been  investigated  and  is  therefore  not 
recommended until further data become available. 
In study MK-8616-089, the results for the primary efficacy endpoint (time to recovery to a TOF ratio of 
≥0.9) indicate that the reversal of moderate NMB was faster following sugammadex 2 mg/kg (geometric 
mean: 1.6 minutes) compared with neostigmine (geometric mean: 7.5 minutes). The difference between 
the  treatments  was  statistically  significant  and  clinically  meaningful.  Pre-specified  subgroup  analyses 
and results for secondary and tertiary efficacy endpoints supported the primary analysis. 
Efficacy data for sugammadex 4 mg/kg that were collected in 191 paediatric patients are relevant new 
information, although no comparator existed for reversal of deep block. In addition, data on the use for 
reversal of vecuronium-induced blockade in children and adolescents is valuable new information. The 
median time (range) to TOF ratio ≥0.9 was 1.7 (0.4; 118.1) minutes in patients with deep block. Delayed 
recovery was observed in 14 of 191 subjects (7.3%). Efficacy data for sugammadex 2 mg/kg (n = 33 in 
Part B) support the approved posology for reversal of moderate block in paediatric patients. 
PK data were collected in 18 and 22 paediatric patients in sugammadex 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg groups, 
respectively. Two subjects in 4 mg/kg group had incomplete PK sampling and they were excluded from 
analysis of some PK parameters, which is acceptable. Overall, the PK data supported the conclusion of 
dose proportional increase in exposure over the dose range 2 to 4 mg/kg in paediatric subjects. This is 
in line with adult PK data. 
AEs were reported in majority of patients, which is expected given the study population (patients with 
surgical procedure or clinical situation - e.g. intubation - that required moderate or deep NMB). The most 
common  reported  AE  was  procedural  pain  (reported  in  more  than  50%  of  patients),  followed  by 
procedural or other nausea and vomiting. Of more interest are the drug-related AEs that were reported 
in 7.8%, 2.6% and 11.8% of patients in sugammadex 2 mg/kg, sugammadex 4 mg/kg and neostigmine 
+  (glycopyrrolate  or  atropine)  group,  respectively,  and  cases  of  clinically  relevant  bradycardia  (pre-
specified  event  of  clinical  interest)  that  were  reported  in  2.0%,  1.6%  and  5.9%  of  patients  in 
sugammadex 2 mg/kg, sugammadex 4 mg/kg and neostigmine + (glycopyrrolate or atropine) group, 
respectively. Although the safety data are limited, they do not suggest dose-dependent or new safety

3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The MAH submitted a final clinical study report for study MK-8616-089 in accordance with Article 46 of 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended. The study report is written in accordance with the Note for 
guidance on structure and content of clinical study reports (CPMP/ICH/137/95) and it is acceptable. 
  Fulfilled: 
In view of the available data regarding Bridion, the MAH should either submit a variation in accordance 
with Articles 16 and 17 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 or provide a justification for not doing so. This 
should be provided without any delay and no later than 60 days after the receipt of these conclusions. 
It is noted that the MAH has already expressed their plan to submit a type II variation later this year 
(2020) to update the Product Information.

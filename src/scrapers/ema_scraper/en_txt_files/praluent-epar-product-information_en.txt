CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
Primary hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia  
Praluent is indicated in adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and non-familial) 
or mixed dyslipidaemia, and in paediatric patients 8 years of age and older with heterozygous familial 
hypercholesterolaemia (HeFH) as an adjunct to diet: 
- 
- 
in combination with a statin or statin with other lipid lowering therapies in patients unable to reach 
LDL-C goals with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin or, 
alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant, or 
for whom a statin is contraindicated. 
Established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease  
Praluent is indicated in adults with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease to reduce 
cardiovascular risk by lowering LDL-C levels, as an adjunct to correction of other risk factors:  
- 
- 
in combination with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin with or without other lipid-lowering 
therapies or, 
alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant, or 
for whom a statin is contraindicated. 
For study results with respect to effects on LDL-C, cardiovascular events and populations studied see section 
5.1. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Posology 
Adults 
Prior to initiating alirocumab secondary causes of hyperlipidaemia or mixed dyslipidaemia (e.g., nephrotic 
syndrome, hypothyroidism) should be excluded. 
The usual starting dose for alirocumab is 75 mg administered subcutaneously once every 2 weeks. Patients 
requiring larger LDL-C reduction (>60%) may be started on 150 mg once every 2 weeks, or 300 mg once 
every 4 weeks (monthly), administered subcutaneously. 
The dose of alirocumab can be individualised based on patient characteristics such as baseline LDL-C level, 
goal of therapy, and response. Lipid levels can be assessed 4 to 8 weeks after treatment initiation or titration, 
and dose adjusted accordingly (up-titration or down-titration). If additional LDL-C reduction is needed in 
patients treated with 75 mg once every 2 weeks or 300 mg once every 4 weeks (monthly), the dosage may be 
adjusted to the maximum dosage of 150 mg once every 2 weeks.

Missed dose 
If a dose is missed, the dose should be administered as soon as possible and thereafter, dosing should be 
resumed on the original schedule. 
Special populations 
Elderly  
No dose adjustment is needed for elderly patients.  
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No data are available 
in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Limited data are 
available in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 5.2). 
Body weight 
No dose adjustment is needed in patients based on weight.  
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Praluent in children less than 8 years of age have not been established. No data are 
available. 
Method of administration  
Subcutaneous use. 
Alirocumab is injected as a subcutaneous injection into the thigh, abdomen or upper arm. 
Each pre-filled pen or pre-filled syringe is for single use only. 
To administer the 300 mg dose, either one 300 mg injection or two 150 mg injections should be given 
consecutively at two different injection sites. 
It is recommended to rotate the injection site with each injection. 
Alirocumab should not be injected into areas of active skin disease or injury such as sunburns, skin rashes, 
inflammation, or skin infections. 
Alirocumab must not be co-administered with other injectable medicinal products at the same injection site.  
Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product 
The solution should be allowed to warm to room temperature prior to use (see section 6.6). 
Paediatric patients 8 years of age and older 
In adolescents 12 years of age and older, it is recommended that Praluent be administered by or under the 
supervision of an adult. 
In children less than 12 years of age, Praluent must be given by a caregiver. 
Adults 
Adult patients may either self-inject alirocumab, or a caregiver may administer alirocumab, after guidance 
has been provided by a healthcare professional on proper subcutaneous injection technique. 
4.3  Contraindications  
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use  
Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the 
administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Allergic reactions 
General allergic reactions, including pruritus, as well as rare and sometimes serious allergic reactions such as 
hypersensitivity, nummular eczema, urticaria, and hypersensitivity vasculitis have been reported in clinical 
studies. Angioedema has been reported in the postmarketing setting (see section 4.8). If signs or symptoms 
of serious allergic reactions occur, treatment with alirocumab must be discontinued and appropriate 
symptomatic treatment initiated (see section 4.3).  
Renal impairment 
In clinical studies, there was limited representation of patients with severe renal impairment (defined as 
eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see section 5.2). Alirocumab should be used with caution in patients with 
severe renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment 
Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) have not been studied (see section 5.2). Alirocumab 
should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Effects of alirocumab on other medicinal products   
Since alirocumab is a biological medicinal product, no pharmacokinetic effects of alirocumab on other 
medicinal products and no effect on cytochrome P450 enzymes are anticipated.  
Effects of other medicinal products on alirocumab 
Statins and other lipid-modifying therapy are known to increase production of PCSK9, the protein targeted by 
alirocumab.  This  leads  to  the  increased  target-mediated  clearance  and  reduced  systemic  exposure  of 
alirocumab. Compared to alirocumab monotherapy, the exposure to alirocumab is about 40%, 15%, and 35% 
lower when used concomitantly with statins, ezetimibe, and fenofibrate, respectively. However, reduction of 
LDL-C is maintained during the dosing interval when alirocumab is administered every two weeks. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of Praluent in pregnant women. Alirocumab is a recombinant IgG1 antibody, 
therefore it is expected to cross the placental barrier (see section 5.3).  
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to maintenance of pregnancy or 
embryo-foetal development; maternal toxicity was noted in rats, but not in monkeys at doses in excess of the 
human dose, and a weaker secondary immune response to antigen challenge was observed in the offspring of 
monkeys (see section 5.3).  
The use of Praluent is not recommended during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman 
requires treatment with alirocumab. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether alirocumab is excreted in human milk. Human immunoglobulin G (IgG) is excreted 
in human milk, in particular in colostrum; the use of Praluent is not recommended in breast-feeding women 
during this period. For the remaining duration of breast-feeding, exposure is expected to be low.  
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Since the effects of alirocumab on the breast-fed infant are unknown, a decision should be made whether to 
discontinue nursing or to discontinue Praluent during this period. 
Fertility 
In animal studies, there were no adverse effects on surrogate markers of fertility (see section 5.3). There are 
no data on adverse effects on fertility in humans. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Praluent has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse reactions, at recommended doses, are local injection site reactions (6.1%), upper 
respiratory tract signs and symptoms (2.0%), and pruritus (1.1%). Most common adverse reactions leading to 
treatment discontinuation in patients treated with alirocumab were local injection site reactions.  
The safety profile in ODYSSEY OUTCOMES was consistent with the overall safety profile described in the 
phase 3 controlled trials. 
No difference in the safety profile was observed between the two doses (75 mg and 150 mg) used in the 
phase 3 program. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions  
The following adverse reactions were reported in patients treated with alirocumab in pooled controlled 
studies and/or post-marketing use (see Table 1). 
Frequencies for all adverse reactions identified from clinical trials have been calculated based on their 
incidence in pooled phase 3 clinical trials. Adverse reactions are presented by system organ class. Frequency 
categories are defined as: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to 
<1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the 
available data).  
The frequency of adverse reactions reported during post-marketing use cannot be determined as they are 
derived from spontaneous reports. Consequently, the frequency of these adverse reactions is qualified as "not 
known".

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Local injection site reactions  
Local injection site reactions, including erythema/redness, itching, swelling, and pain/tenderness, were 
reported in 6.1% of patients treated with alirocumab versus 4.1% in the control group (receiving placebo 
injections). Most injection site reactions were transient and of mild intensity. The discontinuation rate due to 
local injection site reactions was comparable between the two groups (0.2% in the alirocumab group versus 
0.3% in the control group). In the cardiovascular outcomes study (ODYSSEY OUTCOMES), injection site 
reactions also occurred more frequently in alirocumab-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients (3.8% 
alirocumab versus 2.1% placebo). 
General allergic reactions  
General allergic reactions were reported more frequently in the alirocumab group (8.1% of patients) than in 
the control group (7.0% of patients), mainly due to a difference in the incidence of pruritus. The observed 
cases of pruritus were typically mild and transient. In addition, rare and sometimes serious allergic reactions 
such as hypersensitivity, nummular eczema, urticaria, and hypersensitivity vasculitis have been reported in 
controlled clinical studies (see section 4.4). In the cardiovascular outcomes study (ODYSSEY 
OUTCOMES), general allergic reactions were similar in alirocumab-treated patients and placebo-treated 
patients (7.9% alirocumab, 7.8% placebo). No difference was seen in the incidence of pruritus. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
Although no safety issues were observed in patients over 75 years of age, data are limited in this age group. 
In the phase 3 primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidaemia controlled studies, 1,158 patients 
(34.7%) treated with alirocumab were ≥65 years of age and 241 patients (7.2%) treated with alirocumab were 
≥75 years of age. In the cardiovascular outcomes controlled study, 2,505 patients (26.5%) treated with 
alirocumab were ≥65 years of age and 493 patients (5.2%) treated with alirocumab were ≥75 years of age. 
There were no significant differences observed in safety and efficacy with increasing age. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Praluent have been established in children and adolescents with heterozygous 
familial hypercholesterolaemia (HeFH). A clinical study to evaluate the effects of Praluent was conducted in 
153 patients, 8 to 17 years of age with HeFH. No new safety findings were identified and the safety data in 
this population were consistent with the known safety profile of the product in adults with HeFH. 
The experience of alirocumab in paediatric patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia 
(HoFH) is limited to 18 patients aged 8 to 17 years. No new safety finding was observed compared to the 
known adult safety profile. 
Every 4 week dosing study  
The safety profile in patients treated with a 300 mg once every 4 week (monthly) dosing regimen was similar 
to the safety profile as described for the clinical studies program using a 2 week dosing regimen, except for a 
higher rate of local injection site reactions. Local injection site reactions were reported overall at a frequency 
of 16.6% in the 300 mg once every 4 weeks treatment group and 7.9% in the placebo group. Patients in the 
alirocumab 300 mg every 4 weeks treatment group received alternating placebo injections to maintain 
blinding in regard to injection frequency. Excluding injection site reactions (ISRs) that occurred after these 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
placebo injections, the frequency of ISRs was 11.8%. The discontinuation rate due to injection site reactions 
was 0.7% in the 300 mg once every 4 weeks treatment group and 0% in the placebo group. 
LDL-C values <25 mg/dL (<0.65 mmol/L) 
In all clinical studies background lipid lowering therapies could not be adjusted by trial design. The 
percentage of patients who reached LDL-C values <25 mg/dL (<0.65 mmol/L) depended both on the 
baseline LDL-C and the dose of alirocumab. 
In a pool of controlled studies using a 75 mg every 2 week (Q2W) starting dose and in which the dose was 
increased to 150 mg Q2W if the patient’s LDL-C was not <70 mg/dL or < 100 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L or 2.59 
mmol/L), 29.3% of patients with baseline LDL-C <100 mg/dL and 5.0% of patients with baseline LDL-C 
≥100 mg/dL treated with alirocumab had two consecutive values of LDL-C <25 mg/dL (<0.65 mmol/L). In 
the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study, in which the starting alirocumab dose was 75 mg Q2W and the dose 
was increased to 150 mg Q2W if the patient’s LDL-C was not <50 mg/dL (1.29 mmol/L), 54.8% of patients 
with baseline LDL-C <100 mg/dL and 24.2% of patients with baseline LDL-C ≥100 mg/dL treated with 
alirocumab had two consecutive values of LDL-C <25 mg/dL (<0.65 mmol/L). 
Although adverse consequences of very low LDL-C were not identified in alirocumab trials, the long-term 
effects of sustained very low levels of LDL-C are unknown. 
 Immunogenicity/ Anti-drug-antibodies (ADA)  
In the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial, 5.5% of patients treated with alirocumab 75 mg and/or 150 mg every 
2 weeks (Q2W) had anti-drug antibodies (ADA) detected after initiating treatment compared with 1.6% of 
patients treated with placebo, most of these were transient responses. Persistent ADA responses were 
observed in 0.7% of patients treated with alirocumab and 0.4% of patients treated with placebo. Neutralising 
antibody (NAb) responses were observed in 0.5% of patients treated with alirocumab and in <0.1% of 
patients treated with placebo.  
Anti-drug antibody responses, including NAb, were low titer and did not appear to have a clinically 
meaningful impact on the efficacy or safety of alirocumab, except for a higher rate of injection site reactions 
in patients with treatment emergent ADA compared to patients who were ADA negative (7.5% vs 3.6%). 
The long-term consequences of continuing alirocumab treatment in the presence of ADA are unknown. 
In a pool of ten placebo-controlled and active-controlled trials of patients treated with alirocumab 75 mg 
and/or 150 mg Q2W as well as in a separate clinical study of patients treated with alirocumab 75 mg Q2W or 
300 mg every 4 weeks (including some patients with dose adjustment to 150 mg Q2W), the incidence of 
detecting ADA and NAb was similar to the results from the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial described above. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked 
to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
There is no specific treatment for alirocumab overdose. In the event of an overdose, the patient should be 
treated symptomatically, and supportive measures instituted as required.

Mechanism of action 
Alirocumab is a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity and specificity to 
proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9). PCSK9 binds to the low-density lipoprotein receptors 
(LDLR) on the surface of hepatocytes to promote LDLR degradation within the liver. LDLR is the primary 
receptor that clears circulating LDL, therefore the decrease in LDLR levels by PCSK9 results in higher blood 
levels of LDL-C. By inhibiting the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR, alirocumab increases the number of LDLRs 
available to clear LDL, thereby lowering LDL-C levels.  
The LDLR also binds triglyceride-rich VLDL remnant lipoproteins and intermediate-density lipoprotein 
(IDL). Therefore, alirocumab treatment can produce reductions in these remnant lipoproteins as evidenced 
by its reductions in apolipoprotein B (Apo B), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and 
triglycerides (TG). Alirocumab also results in reductions in lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)], which is a form of LDL 
that is bound to apolipoprotein (a). However, the LDLR has been shown to have a low affinity for Lp(a), 
therefore the exact mechanism by which alirocumab lowers Lp(a) is not fully understood. 
In genetic studies in humans, PCSK9 variants with either loss-of-function or gain-of-function mutations have 
been identified. Individuals with single allele PCSK9 loss-of-function mutation have lower levels of LDL-C, 
which correlated with a significantly lower incidence of coronary heart disease. A few individuals have been 
reported, who carry PCSK9 loss-of-function mutations in two alleles and have profoundly low LDL-C 
levels, with HDL-C and TG levels in the normal range. Conversely, gain-of-function mutations in the 
PCSK9 gene have been identified in patients with increased LDL-C levels and a clinical diagnosis of familial 
hypercholesterolaemia. 
In a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 14 week study, 13 patients with heterozygous familial 
hypercholesterolaemia (heFH) due to gain-of-function mutations in the PCSK9 gene were randomised to 
receive either alirocumab 150 mg Q2W or placebo. Mean baseline LDL-C was 151.5 mg/dL (3.90 mmol/L). 
At week 2, the mean reduction from baseline in LDL-C was 62.5% in the alirocumab-treated patients as 
compared to 8.8% in the placebo patients. At week 8, the mean reduction in LDL-C from baseline with all 
patients treated with alirocumab was 72.4%.  
Pharmacodynamic effects 
In in vitro assays, alirocumab did not induce Fc-mediated effector function activity (antibody-dependent 
cell-mediated toxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity) either in the presence or absence of PCSK9 
and no soluble immune complexes capable of binding complement proteins were observed for alirocumab 
when bound to PCSK9.  
Clinical efficacy and safety in primary hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia 
Summary of the Phase 3 Clinical Trials Program - 75 mg and/or 150 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) dosing 
regimen 
The efficacy of alirocumab was investigated in ten phase 3 trials (five placebo-controlled and five 
ezetimibe-controlled studies), involving 5,296 randomised patients with hypercholesterolaemia 
(heterozygous familial and non-familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, with 3,188 patients randomised to 
alirocumab. In the phase 3 studies, 31% of patients had type 2 diabetes mellitus, and 64% of patients had a 
history of coronary heart disease. Three of the ten studies were conducted exclusively in patients with 
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (heFH). The majority of patients in the phase 3 program were 
taking background lipid-modifying therapy consisting of a maximally tolerated dose of statin, with or 
without other lipid-modifying therapies, and were at high or very high cardiovascular (CV) risk. Two studies 
were conducted in patients who were not concomitantly treated with a statin, including one study in patients 
with documented statin intolerance.  
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Two studies (LONG TERM and HIGH FH), involving a total of 2,416 patients, were performed with a 
150 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) dose only. Eight studies were performed with a dose of 75 mg Q2W, and 
criteria-based up-titration to 150 mg Q2W at week 12 in patients who did not achieve their pre-defined target 
LDL-C based on their level of CV risk at week 8.  
The primary efficacy endpoint in all of the phase 3 studies was the mean percent reduction from baseline in 
LDL-C at week 24 as compared to placebo or ezetimibe. All of the studies met their primary endpoint. In 
general, administration of alirocumab also resulted in a statistically significant greater percent reduction in 
total cholesterol (Total-C), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), apolipoprotein B (Apo 
B), and lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] as compared to placebo/ ezetimibe, whether or not patients were 
concomitantly being treated with a statin. Alirocumab also reduced triglycerides (TG), and increased 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and apolipoprotein A-1 (Apo A-1) as compared to placebo. 
For detailed results see Table 2 below. Reduction in LDL-C was seen across age, gender, body mass index 
(BMI), race, baseline LDL-C levels, patients with heFH and non-heFH, patients with mixed dyslipidaemia, 
and diabetic patients. Although similar efficacy was observed in patients over 75 years, data are limited in 
this age group. LDL-C reduction was consistent regardless of concomitantly used statins and doses. A 
significantly higher proportion of patients achieved an LDL-C of ˂70 mg/dL (˂1.81 mmol/L) in the 
alirocumab group as compared to placebo or ezetimibe at week 12 and week 24. In studies using the criteria-
based up-titration regimen, a majority of patients achieved the pre-defined target LDL-C (based on their 
level of CV risk) on the 75 mg Q2W dose, and a majority of patients maintained treatment on the 75 mg 
Q2W dose. The lipid-lowering effect of alirocumab was observed within 15 days after the first dose reaching 
maximum effect at approximately 4 weeks. With long-term treatment, efficacy was sustained over the 
duration of the studies (up to 2 years). Following discontinuation of alirocumab, no rebound in LDL-C was 
observed, and LDL-C levels gradually returned to baseline levels.  
In pre-specified analyses before possible up-titration at week 12 in the 8 studies in which patients started 
with the 75 mg every 2 weeks dosing regimen, mean reductions in LDL-C ranging from 44.5% to 49.2% 
were achieved. In the 2 studies in which patients were started and maintained on 150 mg every 2 weeks, the 
achieved mean reduction of LDL-C at week 12 was 62.6%. In analyses of pooled phase 3 studies that 
allowed up-titration, among the subgroup of patients up-titrated, an increase from 75 mg Q2W to 150 mg 
Q2W alirocumab at week 12 resulted in an additional 14% mean reduction in LDL-C in patients on a 
background statin. In patients not on a background statin, up-titration of alirocumab resulted in an additional 
3% mean reduction in LDL-C, with the majority of the effect seen in approximately 25% of patients who 
achieved at least an additional 10% LDL-C lowering after up-titration. Patients up-titrated to 150 mg Q2W 
had a higher mean baseline LDL-C. 
Evaluation of cardiovascular (CV) events  
In pre-specified analyses of pooled phase 3 studies, treatment-emergent CV events confirmed by 
adjudication, consisting of coronary heart disease (CHD) death, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, 
unstable angina requiring hospitalisation, congestive heart failure hospitalisation, and revascularisation, were 
reported in 110 (3.5%) patients in the alirocumab group and 53 (3.0%) patients in the control group (placebo 
or active control) with HR=1.08 (95% CI, 0.78 to 1.50). Major adverse cardiovascular events (“MACE-
plus”, i.e.: CHD death, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and unstable angina requiring hospitalisation) 
confirmed by adjudication were reported in 52 of 3,182 (1.6%) patients in the alirocumab group and 33 of 
1,792 (1.8%) patients in the control group (placebo or active control); HR=0.81 (95% CI, 0.52 to 1.25). 
In pre-specified final analyses of the LONG TERM study, treatment-emergent CV events confirmed by 
adjudication occurred in 72 of 1,550 (4.6%) patients in the alirocumab group and in 40 of 788 (5.1%) 
patients in the placebo group; MACE-plus confirmed by adjudication were reported in 27 of 1,550 (1.7%) 
patients in the alirocumab group and 26 of 788 (3.3%) patients in the placebo group. Hazard ratios were 
calculated post-hoc; for all CV events, HR=0.91 (95% CI, 0.62 to 1.34); for MACE-plus, HR=0.52 (95% CI, 
0.31 to 0.90). 
All-cause mortality

All-cause mortality in phase 3 studies was 0.6% (20 of 3,182 patients) in the alirocumab group and 0.9% (17 
of 1,792 patients) in the control group. The primary cause of death in the majority of these patients was CV 
events. 
Combination therapy with a statin 
Placebo-controlled phase 3 studies (on background statin) in patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia 
or mixed dyslipidaemia 
LONG TERM study  
This multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 18-month study included 2,310 patients with primary 
hypercholesterolaemia at high or very high CV risk and on a maximally tolerated dose of statin, with or 
without other lipid-modifying therapy. Patients received either alirocumab at a dose of 150 mg Q2W or 
placebo in addition to their existing lipid-modifying therapy. The LONG TERM study included 17.7% heFH 
patients, 34.6% with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and 68.6% with a history of coronary heart disease. At week 
24, the mean treatment difference from placebo in LDL-C percent change from baseline was -61.9% (95% 
CI: -64.3%, -59.4%; p-value: ˂0.0001). For detailed results see Table 2. At week 12, 82.1% of patients in the 
alirocumab group reached an LDL-C ˂70 mg/dL (˂1.81 mmol/L) compared to 7.2% of patients in the 
placebo group. Difference versus placebo was statistically significant at week 24 for all lipids/lipoproteins. 
COMBO I study 
A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 52 week study included 311 patients categorised as very 
high CV risk and not at their pre-defined target LDL-C on a maximally tolerated dose of statin, with or 
without other lipid-modifying therapy. Patients received either 75 mg alirocumab Q2W or placebo in 
addition to their existing lipid-modifying therapy. Dose up-titration of alirocumab to 150 mg Q2W occurred 
at week 12 in patients with LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL (≥1.81 mmol/L). At week 24, the mean treatment difference 
from placebo in LDL-C percent change from baseline was -45.9% (95% CI: -52.5%, -39.3%; p-value: 
˂0.0001). For detailed results see Table 4. At week 12 (before up-titration), 76.0% of patients in the 
alirocumab group reached an LDL-C of ˂70 mg/dL (˂ 1.81 mmol/L) as compared to 11.3% in the placebo 
group. The dose was up-titrated to 150 mg Q2W in 32 (16.8%) patients treated beyond 12 weeks. Among the 
subgroup of patients up-titrated at week 12, an additional 22.8% mean reduction in LDL-C was achieved at 
week 24. The difference versus placebo was statistically significant at week 24 for all lipids/ lipoproteins 
except TG and Apo A-1. 
Placebo-controlled phase 3 studies (on background statin) in patients with heterozygous familial 
hypercholesterolaemia (heFH) 
FH I and FH II studies  
Two multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind 18-month studies included 732 patients with heFH 
receiving a maximally tolerated dose of statin, with or without other lipid-modifying therapy. Patients 
received either alirocumab 75 mg Q2W or placebo in addition to their existing lipid-modifying therapy. Dose 
up-titration of alirocumab to 150 mg Q2W occurred at week 12 in patients with LDL-C 
≥70 mg/dL (≥1.81 mmol/L). At week 24, the mean treatment difference from placebo in LDL-C percent 
change from baseline was -55.8% (95% CI: -60.0%, -51.6%; p-value: ˂ 0.0001). For detailed results see 
Table 2. At week 12 (before up-titration), 50.2% of patients reached an LDL-C of 
˂70 mg/dL (˂1.81 mmol/L) as compared to 0.6% in the placebo group. Among the subgroup of patients 
up-titrated at week 12, an additional 15.7% mean reduction in LDL-C was achieved at week 24. Difference 
versus placebo was statistically significant at week 24 for all lipids/ lipoproteins.

HIGH FH study 
A third multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled 18-month study included 106 heFH patients on a 
maximally tolerated dose of statin, with or without other lipid-modifying therapies, and a baseline LDL-C 
≥160 mg/dL (≥4.14 mmol/L). Patients received either alirocumab at a dose of 150 mg Q2W or placebo in 
addition to their existing lipid-modifying therapy. At week 24, the mean treatment difference from placebo in 
LDL-C percent change from baseline was -39.1% (95% CI: -51.1%, -27.1%; p-value: ˂0.0001). For detailed 
results see Table 2. Mean changes for all other lipids/ lipoproteins were similar to the FH I and FH II studies, 
however statistical significance was not reached for TG, HDL-C and Apo A-1.  
Ezetimibe-controlled phase 3 study (on background statin) in patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia 
or mixed dyslipidaemia  
COMBO II study  
A multicenter, double-blind, ezetimibe-controlled 2 year study included 707 patients categorised as very high 
CV risk and not at their pre-defined target LDL-C on a maximally tolerated dose of statin. Patients received 
either alirocumab 75 mg Q2W or ezetimibe 10 mg once daily in addition to their existing statin therapy. 
Dose up-titration of alirocumab to 150 mg Q2W occurred at week 12 in patients with LDL-C 
≥70 mg/dL (≥1.81 mmol/L). At week 24, the mean treatment difference from ezetimibe in LDL-C percent 
change from baseline was -29.8% (95% CI: -34.4%, -25.3%; p-value: ˂0.0001). For detailed results see 
Table 2. At week 12 (before up-titration), 77.2% of patients reached an LDL-C of 
˂70 mg/dL (˂1.81 mmol/L) as compared to 46.2% in the ezetimibe group. Among the subgroup of patients 
up-titrated at week 12, an additional 10.5% mean reduction in LDL-C was achieved at week 24. Difference 
versus ezetimibe was statistically significant at week 24 for all lipids/ lipoproteins except for TG, and Apo 
A-1. 
Monotherapy or as add-on to non-statin lipid-modifying therapy 
Ezetimibe-controlled phase 3 trials in patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia (without a background 
statin) 
ALTERNATIVE study  
A multicentre, double-blind, ezetimibe-controlled, 24 week study included 248 patients with documented 
statin intolerance due to skeletal muscle-related symptoms. Patients received either alirocumab 75 mg Q2W 
or ezetimibe 10 mg once daily, or atorvastatin 20 mg once daily (as a re-challenge arm). Dose up-titration of 
alirocumab to 150 mg Q2W occurred at week 12 in patients with LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL (≥1.81 mmol/L) or 
≥100 mg/dL (≥2.59 mmol/L), depending on their level of CV risk. At week 24, the mean treatment 
difference from ezetimibe in LDL-C percent change from baseline was -30.4% (95% CI: -36.6%, -24.2%; p-
value: ˂0.0001). For detailed results see Table 2. At week 12 (before up-titration), 34.9% of patients reached 
an LDL-C of ˂70 mg/dL (˂1.81 mmol/L) as compared to 0% in the ezetimibe group. Among the subgroup of 
patients up-titrated at week 12, an additional 3.6% mean reduction in LDL-C was achieved at week 24. 
Difference versus ezetimibe was statistically significant at week 24 for LDL-C, Total-C, Non-HDL-C, Apo 
B, and Lp(a). 
This trial evaluated patients who did not tolerate at least two statins (at least one at the lowest approved 
dose), In these patients, musculo-skeletal adverse events occurred at a lower rate in the alirocumab group 
(32.5%) as compared to the atorvastatin group (46.0%) (HR= 0.61 [95% CI, 0.38 to 0.99]), and a lower 
percentage of patients in the alirocumab group (15.9%) discontinued study treatment due to musculo-skeletal 
adverse events as compared to the atorvastatin group (22.2%). In the five placebo-controlled trials in patients 
on a maximally tolerated dose of statin (n=3752), the discontinuation rate due to musculo-skeletal adverse 
events was 0.4% in the alirocumab group and 0.5% in the placebo group.  
MONO study  
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A multicenter, double-blind, ezetimibe-controlled, 24-week study included 103 patients with a moderate CV 
risk, not taking statins or other lipid-modifying therapies, and a baseline LDL-C between 
100 mg/dL (2.59 mmol/L) to 190 mg/dL (4.91 mmol/L). Patients received either alirocumab 75 mg Q2W or 
ezetimibe 10 mg once daily. Dose up-titration of alirocumab to 150 mg Q2W occurred at week 12 in patients 
with LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL (≥1.81 mmol/L). At week 24, the mean treatment difference from ezetimibe in 
LDL-C percent change from baseline was -31.6% (95% CI: -40.2%, -23.0%; p-value: ˂0.0001). For detailed 
results see Table 2. At week 12 (before up-titration), 57.7% of patients reached an LDL-C of 
˂70 mg/dL (˂1.81 mmol/L) as compared to 0% in the ezetimibe group. The dose was up-titrated to 150 mg 
Q2W in 14 (30.4%) patients treated beyond 12 weeks. Among the subgroup of patients up-titrated at week 
12, an additional 1.4 % mean reduction in LDL-C was achieved at week 24. The difference versus ezetimibe 
was statistically significant at week 24 for LDL-C, Total-C, Non-HDL-C and Apo B.

Every 4 week (Q4W) dosing regimen 
CHOICE I study  
A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 48 week study included 540 patients on a maximally 
tolerated dose of a statin, with or without other lipid-modifying therapy (308 in the alirocumab 300 mg Q4W 
group, 76 in the alirocumab 75 mg Q2W group, and 156 in the placebo group), and 252 patients not treated 
with a statin (144 in the alirocumab 300 mg Q4W group, 37 in the alirocumab 75 mg Q2W group, and 71 in 
the placebo group). Patients received either alirocumab 300 mg Q4W, alirocumab 75 mg Q2W, or placebo in 
addition to their existing lipid-modifying therapy (statin, non-statin therapy or diet alone). Patients in the 
alirocumab 300 mg every 4 weeks treatment group received alternating placebo injections to maintain 
blinding in regard to injection frequency. Overall, 71.6% of patients were categorized at high or very high 
CV risk and not at their LDL-C target. Dose adjustment in the alirocumab groups to 150 mg Q2W occurred 
at week 12 in patients with LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL or ≥100 mg/dL, depending on their level of CV risk, or in 
patients who did not have at least a 30% reduction of LDL-C from baseline. 
In the cohort of patients on background statin, the mean baseline LDL-C was 112.7 mg/dL. At week 12, the 
mean percent change from baseline with alirocumab 300 mg Q4W in LDL-C (ITT analysis) was -55.3% 
compared to +1.1% for placebo. At week 12 (before dose adjustment), 77.3% of patients treated with 
alirocumab 300 mg Q4W reached an LDL-C of ˂70 mg/dL as compared to 9.3% in the placebo group. At 
week 24, the mean percent change from baseline with alirocumab 300 mg Q4W/150 mg Q2W in LDL-C 
(ITT analysis) was -58.8% compared to -0.1% for placebo. At week 24, the mean treatment difference for 
alirocumab 300 mg Q4W/150 mg Q2W from placebo in LDL-C percent change from baseline was -58.7% 
(97.5% CI: -65.0%, -52.4%; p-value: ˂ 0.0001). In patients treated beyond 12 weeks, the dose was adjusted 
to 150 mg Q2W in 56 (19.3%) of 290 patients in the alirocumab 300 mg Q4W arm. Among the subgroup of 
patients dose adjusted to 150 mg Q2W at week 12, an additional 25.4% reduction in LDL-C was achieved at 
week 24. 
In the cohort of patients not treated with a concomitant statin, the mean baseline LDL-C was 142.1 mg/dL. 
At week 12, the mean percent change from baseline with alirocumab 300 mg Q4W in LDL-C (ITT analysis) 
was -58.4% compared to +0.3% for placebo. At week 12 (before dose adjustment), 65.2% of patients treated 
with alirocumab 300 mg Q4W reached an LDL-C of ˂70 mg/dL as compared to 2.8% in the placebo group. 
At week 24, the mean percent change from baseline with alirocumab 300 mg Q4W/150 mg Q2W in LDL-C 
(ITT analysis) was -52.7% compared to -0.3% for placebo. At week 24, the mean treatment difference for 
alirocumab 300 mg Q4W/150 mg Q2W from placebo in LDL-C percent change from baseline was -52.4% 
(97.5% CI: -59.8%, -45.0%; p-value: ˂ 0.0001). In patients treated beyond 12 weeks, the dose was adjusted 
to 150 mg Q2W in 19 (14.7%) of 129 patients in the alirocumab 300 mg Q4W arm. Among the subgroup of 
patients dose adjusted to 150 mg Q2W at week 12, an additional 7.3% mean reduction in LDL-C was 
achieved at week 24. 
In both cohorts, the difference vs placebo was statistically significant at week 24 for all lipid parameters, 
except for Apo A-1 in the subgroup of patients on background statin.

Clinical efficacy and safety in prevention of cardiovascular events   
ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study  
A multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included 18,924 adult patients (9,462 alirocumab; 9,462 
placebo) followed for up to 5 years. Patients had experienced an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event 4 to 
52 weeks prior to randomization and were treated with a lipid-modifying-therapy (LMT) regimen that was 
statin-intensive (defined as atorvastatin 40 or 80 mg, or rosuvastatin 20 or 40 mg) or at maximally tolerated 
dose of those statins, with or without other LMT. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either alirocumab 
75 mg once every two weeks (Q2W) or placebo Q2W. At month 2, if additional LDL-C lowering was 
required based on pre-specified LDL-C criteria (LDL-C ≥50 mg/dL or 1.29 mmol/L), alirocumab was 
adjusted to 150 mg Q2W. For patients who had their dose adjusted to 150 mg Q2W and who had two 
consecutive LDL-C values below 25 mg/dL (0.65 mmol/L), down-titration from 150 mg Q2W to 75 mg 
Q2W was performed. Patients on 75 mg Q2W who had two consecutive LDL-C values below 15 mg/dL 
(0.39 mmol/L) were switched to placebo in a blinded fashion. Approximately 2,615 (27.7%) of 9,451 
patients treated with alirocumab required dose adjustment to 150 mg Q2W. Of these 2615 patients, 805 
(30.8%) were down-titrated to 75 mg Q2W. Overall, 730 (7.7%) of 9,451 patients switched to placebo. A 
total of 99.5% of patients were followed for survival until the end of the trial. The median follow-up duration 
was 33 months. 
The index ACS event was a myocardial infarction in 83.2% of patients (34.6% STEMI, 48.6% NSTEMI) 
and an episode of unstable angina in 16.8% of patients. Most patients (88.8%) were receiving high intensity 
statin therapy with or without other LMT at randomization. The mean LDL-C value at baseline was 92.4 
mg/dL (2.39 mmol/L). 
Alirocumab significantly reduced the risk for the primary composite endpoint of the time to first occurrence 
of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE-plus) consisting of coronary heart disease (CHD) death, 
non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal and non-fatal ischemic stroke, or unstable angina (UA) requiring 
hospitalization (HR 0.85, 95% CI: 0.78, 0.93; p-value=0.0003). Alirocumab also significantly reduced the 
following composite endpoints: risk of CHD event; major CHD event; cardiovascular event; and the 
composite of all-cause mortality, non-fatal MI, and non-fatal ischemic stroke. A reduction of all-cause 
mortality was also observed, with only nominal statistical significance by hierarchical testing (HR 0.85, 95% 
CI: 0.73, 0.98). The results are presented in Table 3.

Neurocognitive function 
A 96 week, randomized, double-blinded, placebo‑controlled trial evaluated the effect of alirocumab on 
neurocognitive function after 96 weeks of treatment (~2 years) in patients with heterozygous familial 
hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) or non-familial hypercholesterolemia at high or very high cardiovascular risk.  
Neurocognitive function was assessed using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery 
(CANTAB). A total of 2171 patients were randomized; 1087 patients were treated with alirocumab 75 mg 
and/or 150 mg every 2 weeks and 1084 patients were treated with placebo. A majority (>80%) of patients in 
each group completed the 96-week, double-blind treatment period.  
Over the 96 weeks of treatment, alirocumab showed no effect on neurocognitive function. The percentage of 
patients who experienced neurocognitive disorders was low in the alirocumab (1.3%) treatment groups and 
comparable to placebo (1.7%). No safety concerns related to neurocognitive function were observed in 
patients treated with alirocumab who experienced either 2 consecutive LDL-C values <25 mg/dL (<0.65 
mmol/L) or <15 mg/dL (<0.39 mmol/L) during the treatment period. 
Paediatric population 
Treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HoFH) in paediatric patients 
A 48-week, open-label study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alirocumab 75 mg Q2W 
(if body weight (BW) < 50 kg) or 150 mg Q2W (if BW ≥ 50 kg) in 18 paediatric patients (8 to 17 years of 
age) with HoFH on top of background treatments. Patients received alirocumab 75 or 150 mg Q2W without 
dose adjustment up to week 12. 
The mean baseline LDL-C was 9.6 mmol/l (373 mg/dL). The mean percent change from baseline in LDL-C 
to week 12 was -4.1% (95% CI: -23.1% to 14.9%) in the ITT population (N=18) and was associated with a 
high variability in the response with regard to the decrease in LDL-C. Responders achieving ≥15% reduction 
from baseline at weeks 12, 24, and 48 were 50%, 50% and 39% respectively. 
Treatment of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HeFH) in paediatric patients 
The efficacy and safety of alirocumab was evaluated in 153 patients 8 - ≤17 years of age with HeFH in a 
Phase-3 multicentre study. This study consisted of a 24-week randomized, double blind (DB) treatment 
where patients received placebo or alirocumab. This was followed by an 80-week open-label (OL) treatment 
with alirocumab. Patients had to be on a low-fat diet and receiving background lipid-lowering therapy. 
Enrolled patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive alirocumab Q2W or Q4W regimen and placebo. 
In the Q4W dosing regimen, 79 patients received a dose of 150 mg for body weight (BW) <50 kg or 300 mg 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for BW ≥50 kg. Dose up-titration of alirocumab to 75 mg Q2W for BW <50 kg or 150 mg Q2W for BW ≥50 
kg occurred at week 12 in patients with LDL-C ≥110 mg/dL. 
Double-blind treatment period: 
The primary efficacy endpoint in this study was the percent change from baseline to week 24 in LDL-C. 
Data is further detailed in Table 4. Mean absolute LDL-C values at week 24 were 2.847 mmol/L in the 
alirocumab group and 4.177 mmol/L in the placebo group in the Q4W cohort. Reductions in LDL-C were 
observed through the first post-baseline assessment at week 8 and maintained throughout the 24 weeks of 
DB treatment period.

ApoB = apolipoprotein B. All adjusted p-values <0.0001. 
Open-label treatment period: 
A total of 74 patients from the Q4W cohort participated in an 80-week open-label single arm study. The 
initial dose was the alirocumab dose selected for the DB period, according to body weight and dosing 
regimen. Dose could be up- and down-titrated by the investigators based on their medical assessment. The 
mean (SE) percent change in LDL-C from baseline (randomisation in DB period) was -23.4% (4.7) at week 
104. The mean (SE) percent change from baseline to week 104 in other lipid endpoints were: -21.5% (26.2) 
non-HDL-C, -17.8% (21.7) ApoB, -17.4% (19.9) TC. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Absorption 
After subcutaneous administration of 50 mg to 300 mg alirocumab, median times to maximum serum 
concentration (tmax) were 3-7 days. The pharmacokinetics of alirocumab after single subcutaneous 
administration of 75 mg into the abdomen, upper arm or thigh were similar. The absolute bioavailability of 
alirocumab after subcutaneous administration was about 85% as determined by population pharmacokinetic 
analysis. Monthly exposure with 300 mg every 4 weeks treatment was similar to that of 150 mg every 
2 weeks. The fluctuations between Cmax and Ctrough were higher for the every 4 weeks dosage regimen. Steady 
state was reached after 2 to 3 doses with an accumulation ratio up to a maximum of about 2-fold.  
Distribution 
Following intravenous administration, the volume of distribution was about 0.04 to 0.05 L/kg indicating that 
alirocumab is distributed primarily in the circulatory system.  
Biotransformation 
Specific metabolism studies were not conducted, because alirocumab is a protein. Alirocumab is expected to 
degrade to small peptides and individual amino acids. 
Elimination 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Two elimination phases were observed for alirocumab. At low concentrations, the elimination is 
predominately through saturable binding to target (PCSK9), while at higher concentrations the elimination of 
alirocumab is largely through a non-saturable proteolytic pathway.  
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the median apparent half-life of alirocumab at steady state 
was 17 to 20 days in patients receiving alirocumab as monotherapy at subcutaneous doses of either 75 mg 
Q2W or 150 mg Q2W. When co-administered with a statin, the median apparent half-life of alirocumab was 
12 days.  
Linearity/non-linearity 
A slightly greater than dose proportional increase was observed, with a 2.1- to 2.7-fold increase in total 
alirocumab concentrations for a 2-fold increase in dose from 75 mg to 150 mg Q2W. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, age was associated with a small difference in alirocumab 
exposure at steady state, with no impact on efficacy or safety. 
Gender 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, gender has no impact on alirocumab pharmacokinetics. 
Race 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, race had no impact on alirocumab pharmacokinetics. 
Following single-dose subcutaneous administration of 100 mg to 300 mg alirocumab, there was no 
meaningful difference in exposure between Japanese and Caucasian healthy subjects. 
Body weight 
Body weight was identified as one significant covariate in the final population PK model impacting 
alirocumab pharmacokinetics. Alirocumab exposure (AUC0-14d) at steady state at both the 75 and 150 mg 
Q2W dosing regimen was decreased by 29% and 36% in patients weighing more than 100 kg as compared to 
patients weighing between 50 kg and 100 kg. This did not translate into a clinically meaningful difference in 
LDL-C lowering. 
Hepatic impairment 
In a phase 1 study, after administration of a single 75 mg subcutaneous dose, alirocumab pharmacokinetic 
profiles in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment were similar as compared to subjects with 
normal hepatic function. No data are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
Renal impairment  
Since monoclonal antibodies are not known to be eliminated via renal pathways, renal function is not 
expected to impact the pharmacokinetics of alirocumab. Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that 
alirocumab exposure (AUC0-14d) at steady state at both the 75 and 150 mg Q2W dosing regimen was 
increased by 22%-35%, and 49%-50% in patients with mild and moderate renal impairment, respectively, 
compared to patients with normal renal function. The distribution of body weight and age, two covariates 
impacting alirocumab exposure, were different among renal function categories and most likely explain the 
observed pharmacokinetic differences. Limited data are available in patients with severe renal impairment; in 
these patients the exposure to alirocumab was approximately 2-fold higher compared with subjects with 
normal renal function. 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric population 
The pharmacokinetics of Praluent were evaluated in 140 paediatric patients 8 to 17 years of age with 
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HeFH). The steady state mean Ctrough was reached at or before 
Week 8 (first PK sampling during repeated dosing) with the recommended dosing regimen (see Section 4.2).  
Limited pharmacokinetic data are available in 18 paediatric patients (8 to 17 years of age) with HoFH. The 
steady-state mean Ctrough alirocumab concentrations was reached at or before Week 12 in both alirocumab 
75 mg Q2W and 150 mg Q2W groups. No studies with alirocumab have been performed in paediatric 
patients less than 8 years of age (see section 5.1). 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship(s) 
The pharmacodynamic effect of alirocumab in lowering LDL-C is indirect, and mediated through the binding 
to PCSK9. A concentration-dependent reduction in free PCSK9 and LDL-C is observed until target 
saturation is achieved. Upon saturation of PCSK9 binding, further increases in alirocumab concentrations do 
not result in a further LDL-C reduction, however an extended duration of the LDL-C lowering effect is 
observed. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology 
and repeated dose toxicity. 
Reproductive toxicology studies in rats and monkeys indicated that alirocumab, like other IgG antibodies, 
crosses the placental barrier. 
There were no adverse effects on surrogate markers of fertility (e.g. estrous cyclicity, testicular volume, 
ejaculate volume, sperm motility, or total sperm count per ejaculate) in monkeys, and no alirocumab-related 
anatomic pathology or histopathology findings in reproductive tissues in any rat or monkey toxicology study. 
There were no adverse effects on foetal growth or development in rats or monkeys. Maternal toxicity was not 
evident in pregnant monkeys at systemic exposures that were 81 times the human exposure at the 150 mg 
Q2W dose. However, maternal toxicity was noted in pregnant rats at systemic exposures estimated to be 
approximately 5.3 times greater than the human exposure at the 150 mg Q2W dose (based on exposure 
measured in non-pregnant rats during a 5-week toxicology study). 
The offspring of monkeys that received high doses of alirocumab weekly throughout pregnancy had a 
weaker secondary immune response to antigen challenge than did the offspring of control animals. There was 
no other evidence of alirocumab-related immune dysfunction in the offspring.

1.  What Praluent is and what it is used for 
What Praluent is 
• 
• 
Praluent contains the active substance alirocumab.  
Praluent is a monoclonal antibody (a type of specialised protein designed to attach to a target 
substance in the body). Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that recognise and bind to other unique 
proteins. Alirocumab binds to PCSK9. 
How Praluent works 
Praluent helps lower your levels of “bad” cholesterol (also called “LDL cholesterol”). Praluent blocks a 
protein called PCSK9. 
• 
• 
PCSK9 is a protein secreted by liver cells. 
“Bad” cholesterol is normally removed from your blood by binding to specific “receptors” (docking 
stations) in your liver.  
PCSK9 lowers the number of these receptors in the liver – this causes your “bad” cholesterol to be 
higher than it should.  
By blocking PCSK9, Praluent increases the number of receptors available to help remove the “bad” 
cholesterol – this lowers your “bad” cholesterol levels. 
• 
• 
What Praluent is used for 
• 
Adults with high cholesterol levels in their blood (hypercholesterolaemia [heterozygous familial and 
non-familial] or mixed dyslipidaemia) and children and adolescents 8 years of age and older with 
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HeFH).  
Adults with high cholesterol levels in their blood and with cardiovascular disease to reduce 
cardiovascular risk.  
• 
It is given:  
- together with a statin (a commonly used medicine that treats high cholesterol) or other cholesterol 
lowering medicines, if the maximum dose of a statin does not lower levels of cholesterol sufficiently 
or, 
- alone or together with other cholesterol lowering medicines when statins are not tolerated or cannot 
be used. 
54 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Continue to follow your cholesterol-lowering diet while taking this medicine. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Praluent  
Do not use Praluent  
• 
if you are allergic to alirocumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Praluent.  
If you develop a serious allergic reaction, stop using Praluent, talk to your doctor right away. Sometimes 
serious allergic reactions such as hypersensitivity, including angioedema (difficulties breathing, or swelling 
of the face, lips, throat or tongue), nummular eczema (reddish skin spots sometimes with blisters), and 
hypersensitivity vasculitis (which is a specific form of a hypersensitivity reaction with symptoms such as 
diarrhoea, with a rash, or purple-coloured skin spots on the skin) have occurred. For allergic reactions that 
may occur while taking Praluent, see section 4. 
Tell your doctor if you have kidney or liver disease before using this medicine, because Praluent has been 
studied in few patients with severe kidney disease and not in patients with severe liver disease. 
Children and adolescents 
Praluent should  not be given  to children under 8 years old because there is no  experience using the 
medicine in this age group.  
Other medicines and Praluent 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.  
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. 
Praluent is not recommended during pregnancy or breast-feeding.

This medicine is not expected to have any effect on your ability to drive or use machines. 
3. 
How to use Praluent

How much to inject 
Your doctor will tell you which dose is right for you and how often to inject (75 mg or 150 mg once every 2 
weeks, or 300 mg once every 4 weeks/monthly)). Your doctor will check your cholesterol levels and may 
adjust the dose (up or down) during treatment.

When to inject 
Adults 
Inject Praluent once every 2 weeks (for the 75 mg or 150 mg dose), or once every 4 weeks/monthly (for the 
300 mg dose). To give the 300 mg dose, one 300 mg injection or two 150 mg injections should be given in a 
row at two different injection sites. 
55

150 mg or 300 mg dose).  
In adolescents 12 years of age and older, Praluent should be given by or under the supervision of an adult.

If you use more Praluent than you should  
If you use more Praluent than you should, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  
If you forget to use Praluent  
If you miss a dose of Praluent, inject your missed dose as soon as you can. Then take your next dose at your 
regular scheduled time. This will keep you on the original schedule. If you are not sure when to inject 
Praluent, call your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
If you stop using Praluent  
Do not stop using Praluent without talking with your doctor. If you stop using Praluent, your cholesterol 
levels can increase.

1.  What Praluent is and what it is used for 
What Praluent is 
• 
• 
Praluent contains the active substance alirocumab.  
Praluent is a monoclonal antibody (a type of specialised protein designed to attach to a target 
substance in the body). Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that recognise and bind to other unique 
proteins. Alirocumab binds to PCSK9. 
How Praluent works 
Praluent helps lower your levels of “bad” cholesterol (also called “LDL cholesterol”). Praluent blocks a 
protein called PCSK9. 
• 
• 
PCSK9 is a protein secreted by liver cells. 
“Bad” cholesterol is normally removed from your blood by binding to specific “receptors” (docking 
stations) in your liver.  
PCSK9 lowers the number of these receptors in the liver – this causes your “bad” cholesterol to be 
higher than it should.  
By blocking PCSK9, Praluent increases the number of receptors available to help remove the “bad” 
cholesterol – this lowers your “bad” cholesterol levels. 
• 
• 
What Praluent is used for 
• 
Adults with high cholesterol levels in their blood (hypercholesterolaemia, heterozygous familial and 
non-familial, or mixed dyslipidaemia) and children and adolescents 8 years of age and older with 
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HeFH).  
Adults with high cholesterol levels in their blood and with cardiovascular disease to reduce 
cardiovascular risk.  
• 
It is given: 
 - together with a statin (a commonly used medicine that treats high cholesterol) or other cholesterol 
lowering medicines, if the maximum dose of a statin does not lower levels of cholesterol sufficiently 
or, 
- alone or together with other cholesterol lowering medicines when statins are not tolerated or cannot 
be used. 
Continue to follow your cholesterol-lowering diet while taking this medicine. 
88

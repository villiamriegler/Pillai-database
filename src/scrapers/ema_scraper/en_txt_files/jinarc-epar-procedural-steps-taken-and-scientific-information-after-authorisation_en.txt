the opportunity to correct an oversight/editorial error

The MAH justified to amend the PASS protocol by reducing 
the sample size from 3000 to 2100 patients and reducing 
the length of the study duration from 3 years to 2 years of 
follow-up and the PRAC agreed (EMEA/H/C/PSA/S/0078.1). 
Consequently, The MAH submitted an update of the EU Risk 
Management Plan v.15.0 within this type II variation to 
update milestones of the PASS study 156-12-299 (dates for 
study closure, Last Patient Last Visit (LPLV) and final study 
report submission) as committed in the outcome of above-
mentioned procedure. Annex II of Product Information is 
also updated accordingly. The MAH has also submitted an 
amended Package Leaflet to align the information with that 
in the SmPC.

substrates (e.g. sulfasalazine) are co-administered with 
tolvaptan, patients must be managed cautiously and 
evaluated for excessive effects of these medicinal products. 
Administration of rosuvastatin (OATP1B1 substrate) or 
furosemide (OAT3 substrate) to healthy subjects with 
elevated oxobutyric acid metabolite (inhibitor of OATP1B1 
and OAT3) plasma concentrations did not meaningfully 
alter the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin or furosemide. 
Statins commonly used in the tolvaptan phase 3 pivotal 
trial (e.g. rosuvastatin and pitavastatin) are OATP1B1 or 
OATP1B3 substrates, however no difference in adverse 
events profile was observed during the phase 3 pivotal trial 
for tolvaptan in ADPKD. If OCT1 substrates (e.g. 
metformin) are co-administered with tolvaptan, patients 
must be managed cautiously and evaluated for excessive 
effects of these medicinal products.

Teratogenicity was noted in rabbits given 1,000 mg/kg/day

among the common main adverse reactions. The risk of 
glaucoma and skin neoplasm associated to tolvaptan 
remains uncertain; additional results from routine further 
pharmacovigilance activities are needed before making 
definitive conclusions. Information on pregnancy is very 
limited and further monitoring is required. Finally,

information became available in the subpopulation within 
stage 4 CKD. The safety profile of this patient subcategory 
was consistent with the profile described for the overall 
population. A post-hoc analysis for efficacy was conducted 
within this patient subcategory and showed beneficial 
effects on annual eGFR slope. The availability of clinical 
data in this patient subgroup is now reflected in the 
updated SmPC as follows: 
Section 4.2 of the SmPC is updated to state that limited 
data are available for patients with CKD late stage 4 (eGFR 
< 25 mL/min/1.73 m2). 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC is updated to state that there are 
limited safety and efficacy data available for Jinarc in 
patients with CKD late stage 4 (eGFR< 25 mL/min/1.73 
m2) and that there are no data in patients with CKD stage

TEMPO 4:4 is an open-label extension study that included 
results from study 156-08-271 (TEMPO 4:4) listed as 
Annex II 
871 subjects that completed TEMPO 3:4 from 106 centres 
a PAES in Annex II (ANX 005). This study is a 
multicentre, open-label, extension study of trial 156-
04-251 to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy 
of oral tolvaptan tablet regimens in patients with 
autosomal dominant polycystic. It provides data for 
Jinarc treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic 
kidney disease (ADPKD) over 5 years. Annex II of 
the Product Information has been updated 
accordingly. 
Editorial changes have been made to the SmPC to 
align the Product Information with the latest QRD 
template v.10 to include the first date of 
authorisation for the Jinarc MA (27/05/2015) and the 
combination of the 15mg and 30mg strengths into 
one SmPC. In addition, the Marketing authorisation 
holder (MAH) took the opportunity to add the current 
ATC code applicable for tolvaptan as it has been 
assigned by WHO. 
across 13 countries. This trial evaluated the effects of 
tolvaptan on safety, TKV and estimated Glomerular 
Filtration Rate (eGFR) in subjects receiving active 
treatment for 5 years (early-treated), compared with 
subjects treated with placebo for 3 years, then switched to 
active treatment for 2 years (delayed-treated). 
The primary end point for total kidney volume (TKV) did 
not distinguish a difference in change (-1.7%) over the 5 
year treatment between early- and delayed-treated 
subjects at the pre-specified threshold of statistical 
significance (p=0.3580). Both groups’ TKV growth 
trajectory was slowed, relative to placebo in the first 3 
years, suggesting both early- and delayed- tolvaptan 
treated subjects benefitted to a similar degree.  
A secondary endpoint testing the persistence of positive 
effects on renal function indicated that the preservation of 
eGFR observed by the end of the TEMPO 3:4 pivotal trial 
(3.01 to 3.34 mL/min/1.73m2 at follow-up visits 1 and 2)

C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
could be preserved during open-label treatment. This 
difference was maintained in the pre-specified Mixed effect 
Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) analysis (3.15 
mL/min/1.73m2, 95%CI 1.462 to 4.836, p=0.0003) and 
with sensitivity analyses where baseline eGFR data were 
carried forward (2.64 mL/min/1.73m2, 95%CI 0.672 to 
4.603, p=0.0086). These data suggest that Jinarc can slow 
the rate of renal function decline, and that these benefits 
persist over the duration of therapy. 
Longer term data are not currently available to show 
whether long-term therapy with Jinarc continues to slow 
the rate of renal function decline and affect clinical 
outcomes of Automosal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease 
(ADPKD), including delay in the onset of end-stage renal 
disease. 
Genotyping for PKD1 and PKD2 genes was conducted in a 
majority of patients entering the open-label extension 
study (TEMPO 4:4) but the results are not yet 
known.Following an additional 2 years of tolvaptan 
treatment, resulting in a total of 5 years on tolvaptan 
therapy no new safety signals were identified.

Part VI:  Summary of the Risk Management Plan 
Summary of Risk Management Plan for GIAPREZA (angiotensin II) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for GIAPREZA.  The RMP details 
important risks of GIAPREZA, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information 
will be obtained about GIAPREZA's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
GIAPREZA's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how GIAPREZA should be 
used.   
This summary of the RMP for GIAPREZA should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).   
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
GIAPREZA's RMP. 
I.  The medicine and what it is used for 
GIAPREZA is authorised for treatment of adults with low blood pressure due to shock (see 
SmPC for the full indication).  It contains angiotensin II acetate as the active substance and it 
is given by intravenous infusion. 
Further information about the evaluation of GIAPREZA’s benefits can be found in 
GIAPREZA’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European 
Medicines Agency (EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/giapreza. 
II.  Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or 
Further Characterise the Risks 
Important risks of GIAPREZA, together with measures to minimise such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about GIAPREZA's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) assessment - so that 
immediate action can be taken as necessary.  These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities.   
II.A 
List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of GIAPREZA are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
administered.  Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks are 
concerns for which there is sufficient proof of an association with the use of GIAPREZA.  
Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible 
based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further 
evaluation.  Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product 
that is currently missing and needs to be collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

Summary of Important Risks 
Important Identified Risk – Thromboembolic Events 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
In Study LJ501-CRH01, there was a higher incidence of arterial 
and venous thromboembolic events (formation of blood clots in 
intact blood vessels) in subjects who received GIAPREZA 
(12.9%) than in controls (5.1%).  Deep vein thrombosis (clotting 
in large veins, usually in the legs) was the most frequently 
reported type of thrombosis, occurring in 7 subjects (4.3%) 
treated with GIAPREZA and in no subjects in the control group. 
Most of the thromboembolic events were not severe.  The 
proportion of subjects with more severe (Grade 3 or Grade 4) 
thromboembolic events was 5.5% for GIAPREZA, compared 
with 3.2% for placebo.  In the subset of patients with deep vein 
thrombosis, only 1 event was Grade 3 and none of these events 
led to pulmonary embolisms.   
The percentage of patients in the angiotensin II and placebo 
arms with a history of embolic or thrombotic events at baseline 
was similar (52% versus 49%). 
In Study LJ501-CRH01, the incidence of patients receiving a 
prior or concomitant antithrombotic medication was 84.7% in 
the LJPC-501 arm compared to 70.9% in the placebo arm. This 
difference was present at baseline with 69.3% of patients from 
the LJPC-501 arm receiving an antithrombotic at study drug 
initiation compared to 56.3% of patients in the placebo arm. 
There is a trend towards fewer thromboembolic adverse events 
in the patients who received preventive antithrombotic 
medication compared to those who did not receive preventative 
medication. In the LJPC-501 arm, the incidence of patients with 
a thromboembolic adverse event was 16.0% for patients not 
receiving an antithrombotic at baseline compared to 11.5% for 
patients receiving an antithrombotic at baseline. The same trend 
was observed for patients in the placebo arm; the incidence of 
patients with a thromboembolic adverse event was 5.8% for 
patients not receiving an antithrombotic at baseline compared to 
4.5% for patients receiving an antithrombotic at baseline. A 
similar trend was observed when analyses were restricted to 
Grade 3/4 thromboembolic adverse events.   
The evidence linking this type of event to treatment with 
GIAPREZA is derived from a randomised, controlled study.  
Evidence derived from randomised, controlled studies is 
conventionally considered to be reliable. 
 
Important Identified Risk – Thromboembolic Events 
Risk factors and risk groups 
No risk factors for thromboembolic events in subjects given 
GIAPREZA for the treatment of shock have been identified, 
other than the indication for treatment itself.  There is a trend 
towards fewer thromboembolic adverse events in subjects that 
received preventive antithrombotic medication.

Important Identified Risk – Transient Hypertension 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Within the LJPC-501 arm, 37 patients had an increase in 
reported MAP above 100 mmHg (range: 101.3 to 142 mmHg) 
within 15 minutes of initiating study drug.  Study drug dose was 
then down-titrated in all 37 patients and the median time to 
MAP reported below 85 mmHg was 25 minutes (range: 7 to 
65 minutes).  In the placebo arm, 3 patients showed an increase 
in MAP above 100 mmHg (range: 101.5 to 104.3 mmHg) within 
15 minutes. 
The evidence linking this type of event to treatment with 
GIAPREZA is derived from a randomised, controlled study. 
Evidence derived from randomised, controlled studies is

Important Potential Risk – Peripheral Ischaemia 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
In Study LJ501-CRH01, there was a higher incidence of 
peripheral ischaemia (insufficient delivery of oxygen to the 
tissues due to inadequate blood flow) in subjects who received 
GIAPREZA (4.3%) than in controls (2.5%).   
The evidence linking this type of event to treatment with 
GIAPREZA is derived from a randomised, controlled study.  
Evidence derived from randomised, controlled studies is 
conventionally considered to be reliable. 
Vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels) is an intrinsic 
property of angiotensin II and the main mechanism by which 
GIAPREZA increases blood pressure.  Vasoconstriction is dose-
dependent; the more GIAPREZA that is administered, the 
greater the narrowing of blood vessels.  Subjects receiving 
higher infusion rates of GIAPREZA will be more likely to 
experience low blood flows due to vessel narrowing, and will, 
therefore, be at higher risk of peripheral ischaemia (insufficient 
delivery of oxygen to the tissues due to inadequate blood flow).

Section 4.2 of the SmPC has been updated with the 
following information: “If testing of anti-rpFVIII antibodies 
is negative at baseline, a dose lower than the 
recommended 200 U/kg may be used as the initial 
treatment dose. Clinical response should be closely 
monitored as dosing below 200 U/kg has been associated 
with a lack of efficacy (see section 4.4).’’

Renewal of the marketing authorisation. 
17/09/2020

SmPC and PL 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of Obizur 
in the approved indication remains favourable, but 
recommended that one additional five-year renewal be 
required based on the following pharmacovigilance 
grounds: 
Safety issues identified with Obizur warrant additional 
evaluations and analyses conducted in a second renewal: 
Lack of drug effect 
Summary tabulation cumulatively lists 108 serious adverse 
reactions. Leading SOC at the PT level is SOC “General and 
Page 6/14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
administration site disorders” with 30 SARs, 18 referring to 
PTs related to drug effect decreased/drug ineffective/ 
Condition aggravated and thus accounting for 60 % of the 
serious adverse event PTs reported in this SOC. In 
“cumulative all” events (including non-serious) 25 out of 46 
events in SOC “General disorders” refer to lack of drug 
effect-PTs which is 54 % of all PTs in this SOC. 
In view of the committees lack of drug effect therefore 
represents a prominent concern for Obizur. Based on the 
limited information available on case level many cases 
might be associated with dosing other than the 
recommended dose in the SmPC despite the additional risk 
minimisation measures. While a minority of patients only 
receive the currently recommended dose of 200 IU there 
seem to be a high number of ‘lack of drug effect’ cases of 
which the majority (68%) is associated with under dosing. 
Furthermore, it seems that that under dose may be also 
associated with occurrence of anamnestic reaction leading 
to the aggravation of the underlying condition. 
Anamnestic reaction 
Thirty-nine (39) serious adverse events were reported 
through clinical trials for Susoctocog alfa. SOC Immune 
system disorders is presenting with two SAEs, one thereof 
referring to anamnestic and one to anaphylactic reaction. 
Furthermore, during the current renewal interval SUSAR 
‘anamnestic reaction’ was reported in the clinical trial 
CHAWI (study in patients with congenital haemophilia A 
with inhibitors undergoing surgical or other invasive 
procedures; 241502). Out of the eight subjects included in 
the trial six developed new inhibitors (anti-rpFVIII or FVIII) 
or experienced an increase in their previously known FVIII 
Page 7/14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
inhibitors.  
The committees recommended that anamnestic reaction be 
explicitly included in the safety concerns for the product as 
a separate identified risk. The MAH will communicate the 
risk of ‘lack of efficacy’ and in particular the risk of 
anamnestic reaction associated with under dosing by an 
update of the educational material in due time following 
this renewal.

The variation expanded information on Obizur adverse

events by adding that anamnestic reactions with rise in 
human factor VIII and/or porcine factor VIII inhibitors have 
also been reported in patients treated with Obizur.  These 
anamnestic rises may result in lack of response to OBIZUR.  
Furthermore, anamnestic reaction was included in the ADR 
table with the frequency ‘very common’.

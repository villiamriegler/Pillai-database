results from phase 1 study which evaluated the 
pharmacokinetics and safety of regorafenib in cancer

characterize the pharmacokinetics of regorafenib and its 2 
pharmacologically active metabolites M-2 and M-5 and to 
measure the amount of drug excreted in urine as its

metabolites M-7 and M-8 in locally advanced and / or 
metastatic solid tumours cancer subjects with severe renal 
impairment when compared to the control group (cancer 
subjects with normal or mildly impaired renal function). 
Pharmacokinetics was evaluated following single dose 
administration of 160 mg regorafenib and after dosing for 
21 days with 160 mg regorafenib QD. The results show that 
exposure to regorafenib, M-2 and M-5 was not increased in 
subjects with severe renal impairment compared to 
subjects with normal renal function. Excretion of M7and M8 
in urine were decreased in renal impaired subjects, but this 
did not result in higher regorafenib, M-2 nor M5 exposure. 
Overall, the pharmacokinetics of 160 mg regorafenib was 
not affected by severe renal impairment. This is consistent 
with the previously provided PBPK modelling in the MAA.

conducted in 2872 patients with metastatic colorectal 
cancer whose disease had progressed after treatment with 
standard therapies was consistent with the known safety 
profile of regorafenib. 
Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC based on the

long-term results from Study 14874 (GRID

administration of a single dose of rosuvastatin (5 mg), a 
interaction study undertaken to determine the effect 
of multiple doses of regorafenib on the 
pharmacokinetics of probe substrates of transport 
proteins P-gp and BCRP in patients with advanced 
solid malignant tumours. The Package Leaflet has 
been updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took 
the opportunity to make minor changes to Annex II 
to reflect the latest version of the QRD template 
(9.1), and to update the contact details of the local 
BCRP substrate, resulted in a 3.8-fold increase in mean 
exposure (AUC) of rosuvastatin and a 4.6-fold increase in 
Cmax. This indicates that co-administration of regorafenib 
may increase the plasma concentrations of other 
concomitant BCRP substrates (e.g. methotrexate, 
fluvastatin, atorvastatin). Therefore, it is recommended to 
monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of 
increased exposure to BCRP substrates. Clinical data 
indicate that regorafenib has no effect on digoxin

Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Zytiga, the scientific conclusions of 
PRAC are as follows:  
The clinical trial data provided by MAH showed an imbalance between abiraterone group and placebo 
group for sepsis-related adverse events that remained after standardising the difference in treatment 
duration based on event rate per 100 patient-years of exposure. Data from combined study data 
showed incidence of sepsis 2.7% in the abiraterone group vs. 1.8% in the placebo group, mainly 
attributable to study COU-AA-301 (4.2% abiraterone group vs. 1.6% placebo group). From post-
marketing data sources, a total of 10 cases of non-Urinary Tract Infection reporting sepsis (4 cases), 
pneumonia (4 cases), lung infection, and septic shock were identified during the reporting period. 
There were 5 fatal cases (4 for sepsis).  
Therefore, in view of available data regarding sepsis, the PRAC considered that changes to the Product 
Information were warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Zytiga, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance ABIRATERONE is favourable subject 
to the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

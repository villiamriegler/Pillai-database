Renewal of the marketing authorisation.

SmPC, Annex 
Based upon the data that have become available since the 
II, Labelling 
granting of the initial Marketing Authorisation, the CHMP 
and PL 
considers that the benefit-risk balance of alli remains 
positive, but considers that its safety profile is to be closely 
monitored for the following reasons: 
• 
Very limited exposure data is available for the 
27mg chewable tablet recently introduced. 
• 
The CHMP has requested 2 post marketing surveys, 
which have not been initiated or completed, to monitor the 
usage pattern and emerging safety profile. 
Based upon the safety profile of alli, the CHMP decided that 
the MAH should continue to submit 6-monthly PSURs. 
Therefore, based upon the safety profile of alli, which 
requires the submission of 6- monthly PSURs, the CHMP 
concluded that the MAH should submit one additional 
renewal application in 5 years time.

with levothyroxine and antiepileptics and the risk of 
product in relation to warnings on levothyroxine, 
antiepileptic interactions, hyperoxaluria/oxalate 
nephropathy and pancreatitis side effects at the 
CHMP request. Relevant sections of the Labelling and 
Package Leaflet have been amended accordingly. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, 
Labelling and Package Leaflet 
pancreatitis and hyperoxaluria/oxalate nephropathy and 
taking into consideration data from the other orlistat 
containing medicinal product, the CHMP concluded the 
following: 
- Forty five cases of hypothyroidism and other thyroid 
disorders associated with alli were reported .In some cases, 
the time to onset of hypothyroidism typically occurs two 
weeks after initiation of orlistat therapy in a patient on long 
term levothyroxine treatment. This onset time of two 
weeks is likely related to the known slow response to 
levothyroxine dose changes as even the normal peak 
therapeutic effect of regular oral levothyroxine is not 
achieved for several weeks. In addition, two positive 
dechallenges upon orlistat withdrawal were reported. The

CHMP recommended to add warnings in sections 4.4 and 
4.5 to reflect that levothyroxine and orlistat may need to 
be taken at different times and the dose of levothyroxine 
may need to be adjusted due to possible decreased 
absorption of iodine salts and/or levothyroxine. 
- Twelve cases of convulsions were reported with alli 
including 3 suspected drug interactions between 
anticonvulsants and alli, and a positive rechallenge. In line 
with the other orlistat containing medicinal product, the 
CHMP therefore recommended to add warnings in sections 
4.4 and 4.5 to reflect that monitoring for possible changes 
in the frequency and/or severity of convulsions should be 
considered when patients are concomitantly taking an 
antconvulsivant and orlistat due to possible decreased 
absorption of anticonvulsivants (such as valproate and 
lamotrigine). 
- Twenty three cases of pancreatitis were reported with alli. 
Although no causal relationship can be established in some 
of the cases due to confounding factors, 2 positive 
dechallenges were reported. The CHMP therefore 
recommended to include

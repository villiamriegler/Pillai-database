Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
Trecondi in the approved indication remains favourable and 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

malignant transplant indications (non-malignant 
diseases in the paediatric population) for Trecondi 1 
g/5 g powder for solution for infusion based on final 
12-months follow-up results of study MC-
FludT.16/NM; a randomised phase II interventional 
study aimed to compare Treosulfan-based 
conditioning therapy with Busulfan-based 
conditioning prior to allogeneic haematopoietic stem 
cell transplantation in paediatric patients with non-
malignant diseases. 
Further, the MAH proposes to amend an existing 
warning on skin toxicity based on new literature 
data. Moreover, the MAH proposes to introduce a 
slightly modified dosing regimen according to the 
patient’s body surface based on long-term follow-up 
data of paediatric study MC-FludT.17/M, a Phase II 
trial to describe the safety and efficacy of Treosulfan 
based conditioning therapy prior to allogeneic 
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in 
paediatric patients with haematological malignancies, 
as well as a final analysis of the population 
pharmacokinetics of treosulfan in paediatric patients. 
As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 
of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is 
updated in accordance. Version 1.0 of the RMP has 
also been submitted.

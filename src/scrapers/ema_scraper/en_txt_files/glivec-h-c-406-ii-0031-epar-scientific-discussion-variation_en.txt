Scientific discussion  
1. 
Introduction: 
Glivec is currently authorised for Ph+ CML and GIST in the European Union.  This is an extension of 
the currently approved Glivec indications to include the following new orphan indication: “Treatment 
of  adult  patients  with  newly  diagnosed  Philadelphia  chromosome  positive  acute  lymphoblastic 
leukaemia (Ph+ ALL) integrated with chemotherapy and of adult patients with relapsed or refractory 
Ph+ ALL as monotherapy". 
The proposed dose of Glivec for patient with Ph+ ALL is  600 mg/day. 
Acute  lymphoblastic  leukaemia  is  a  heterogeneous  disease  with  distinct  biologic  and  prognostic 
groups,  consisting  of  a  wide  variety  of  genetic  lesions,  including  translocations,  hyperdiploidy  and 
even  normal  appearing  genotypes.  ALL  represents  20%  of  adult  acute  leukaemias.  About  10,000 
patients  with  Acute  Lymphoblastic  Leukaemia  (ALL)  are  diagnosed  annually  in  adults  in  Europe, 
where the annual incidence rates were 1.3 per 100, 000 in men and 0.9 in women. ALL has a bimodal 
distribution.  The  incidence  is  4-5  per  100,000  population  between  the  age  of  2-4,  which  decreases 
during  later  childhood,  adolescence,  and  young  adulthood  before  a  second,  smaller  peak  occurs  in 
patients older than 50 years (incidence 1 per 100,000 population). Philadelphia chromosome-positive 
ALL occurs in 5% to 10% of paediatric cases and in approximately 25% of adult cases. It is the most 
common genetic abnormality and represents an independent adverse risk factor.  
Ph+  ALL  results  from  a  reciprocal  translocation  between  chromosomes  9  and  22,  t(9;22)  (q34;q11), 
which  results  in  the  p210  BCR/ABL  fusion  protein  when  it  involves  the  major  breakpoint  cluster 
region  or  the  p190  fusion  protein  when  it  involves  the  minor  breakpoint  cluster  region.  Among 
patients  with  Ph+ALL,  approximately  70%  of  adults  and  more  than  90%  of  children  have  the  p190 
protein.  The  BCR-ABL  fusion  protein  is  a  constitutive  active  protein  kinase  that  alters  signaling 
pathways  that  control  the  proliferation,  survival,  and  self-renewal  of  hematopoietic  stem  cells. 
Because the kinase activity of BCR/ABL is causally involved in the leukaemic transformation in Ph+ 
ALL, targeted suppression of its activity by imatinib was considered as a potential therapy against the 
pathophysiologic basis of this disease.  
The only potentially curative approach to Ph+ALL is allogeneic stem  cell transplantation, especially 
when  compared  with  chemotherapy  plus  autologous  stem  cell  transplantation,  but  it  is  not  a  viable 
option for many patients due to the lack of a suitable donor, to the toxicity related to transplant and to 
co-morbidities, related or not to age. Overall 3-year survival rate can reach 40% in selected patients.  
Conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, although able to induce a high CR rate, does not eradicate the 
disease and results in an overall median survival of approximately one year. Chemotherapy for ALL is 
also associated with a significant mortality, especially in elderly patients. Furthermore, many of these 
older  patients  cannot  receive  the  standard  ALL  chemotherapy  because  of  co-existing  morbidity  or 
adverse events that impede chemotherapy completion. Induction death rate can range from 8 to 50%, 
when  the  CR  rate  ranges  from  31  to  85%  and  the  median  overall  survival  from  1  to  14  months. 
Therefore,  there  is  a  critical  need  for  an  effective  therapy  with  lower  toxicity  with  the  potential  of 
inducing  and  maintaining  a  minimal  residual  disease  status  (complete  molecular  response)  over  the 
long term. 
2.Clinical aspects: 
Imatinib  is  a  protein-tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor,  which  inhibits  the  Bcr-Abl  tyrosine  kinase  at  the  in 
vitro,  cellular  and  in  vivo  levels.  The  compound  selectively  inhibited  Bcr-Abl  phosphorylation  and 
proliferation  of  Ph+  ALL  cell  lines  as  well  as  primary  leukaemic  cells  obtained  from  Ph+  ALL 
patients.  Because  the  kinase  activity  of  Bcr-Abl  is causally  involved  in  leukaemic  transformation  in 
Ph+  leukaemias  such  as  Ph+  ALL  and  Ph+  CML,  targeted  suppression  of  its  activity  by  imatinib  is 
considered a useful therapy directed against the pathophysiologic basis of these leukaemias.

Clinical efficacy 
The  submitted  dossier  includes  clinical  efficacy  trials  performed  in  two  populations  of  patients, 
corresponding to the subgroups included in the claimed ALL indication: 
-  Newly  diagnosed  Ph+  ALL  patients  (Previously  untreated  patients  received  imatinib  in 
combination with induction and/or consolidation chemotherapy). 
-  Relapsed and/or refractory Ph+ ALL patients  (Patients in first or  subsequent relapse after either 
standard  chemotherapy,  autologous  or  allogeneic  bone  marrow  transplantation,  or  high  dose 
treatment with peripheral blood stem cell support, or patients refractory to standard chemotherapy 
(no  complete  remission  achieved  after  two  conventional  induction  chemotherapy  cycles).  These 
patients  were  treated  with  imatinib  as  monotherapy  or  in  combination  with  induction 
chemotherapy. 
No  pharmacokinetics  studies  have  been  submitted  in  this  variation  dossier,  but  this  is  considered 
acceptable by the assessors, as there is not any rationale to suspect a different pharmacokinetic profile 
in this patient subpopulation. 
No dose finding studies have been performed. The currently accepted doses of 400 mg or 600 mg per 
day have been studied for efficacy in all phase of treatment. The majority of data have been generated 
at a dose of 600 mg, which is the recommended dose for this indication. In addition, imatinib doses of 
800 mg per day have been used in combination with steroids in a small number of patients.  
Efficacy  and  safety  data  are  available  for  a  total  of  758  patients.  These  patients  were  included  in  1 
controlled  and  9  uncontrolled  open-label  clinical  trials,  enrolling  a  total  of  443  patients  with 
relapsed/refractory Ph+ ALL and 315 newly diagnosed patients. A separate age subpopulation analysis 
was performed in a total of 250 patients ≥55 years old, 146 with relapsed/refractory Ph+ ALL and 104 
with newly diagnosed disease.

Study  endpoints  include  haematological  response  (complete  haematological  remission  [CHR],  no 
evidence  of  leukaemia  [NEL],  return  of  chronic  phase  [RTC],  haematopoiesis/partial  response  [PR], 
marrow  response  and  morphologic  response),  cytogenetic  response,  complete  molecular  remission, 
duration of complete remission, overall survival, and time to progression, relapse, resistant disease and 
induction death. 
The definitions of criteria used for response were similar among studies and were defined as follows: 
•  Haematological response (to be confirmed after >4 weeks) included any of the following: 
1)  Complete  haematological  remission  which  required  that  all  of  the  following  were  present: 
bone marrow cellularity and blast count < 5%, no circulating peripheral blood blasts, ANC ≥ 
1.5 x 109/L, Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L, and no evidence of extra-medullary involvement 
2)  No evidence of leukaemia in peripheral blood and bone marrow, without full peripheral blood 
recovery  required  that  all  of  the  following  were  present:  blast  count  <  5%,  no  circulating 
peripheral blood blasts, ANC ≥ 1.0 x 109/L, platelet count > 20 x 109/L (platelet transfusion 
independent and no evidence of bleeding), and no evidence of extramedullary involvement 
3)  Return  of  chronic  phase  haematopoiesis/partial  response  (PR).  For  a  PR,  only  the  first 
criterion  below were to  be fulfilled. For a return to chronic  phase  haematopoiesis,  all  of the 
following criteria were to be fulfilled: percentage of peripheral blasts in blood or bone marrow 
<  15%,  percentage  of  blasts  plus  promyelocytes  in  the  peripheral  blood  or  bone  marrow  < 
30%, and peripheral basophils < 20%. 
4)  Marrow response (marrow-CR) was defined as a decrease in marrow blasts to either no more 
than 5% or between 5 to 15%, regardless of the peripheral-blood cell counts 
5)  Morphologic response was defined as follows: (1) M1, 0% to 5% bone marrow blast cells; (2) 
M2, more than 5% to 25% bone marrow blast cells; or (3) M3, more than 25% bone marrow 
blast cells. 
•  Cytogenetic  response  was  defined  by  the  percentage  of  Ph  chromosome  positive  metaphases  in 
bone marrow and was defined as follows: complete (0% Ph-positive cells); major (1-35%); minor 
(36-65%); minimal (66-95%); none (96-100%). 
•  Complete  molecular  remission  was  defined  by  reverse  transcriptase  polymerase  chain  reaction 
(RT-PCR) negativity in addition to haematological criteria for complete haematological remission.

Patients (>55 years) with Ph+ LL were randomized to receive either 28 days of single-agent imatinib 
induction  at  a  daily  dose  of  600  mg  (group  I)  or  induction  chemotherapy  according  to  the  GMALL 
elderly protocol 07/02 (group II). Intrathecal  CNS-directed prophylactic therapy was allowed during 
induction but limited to four applications. To determine the anti-leukaemic efficacy, minimal residual 
disease analysis was performed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain  reaction (RT-
PCR) assessment of BCR-ABL transcript level in serial peripheral blood and bone marrow samples. 
Results 
A  total  of  55  elderly  patients  (>55  years)  with  newly  diagnosed  Ph+  ALL  or  lymphoid  blast  crisis 
from 32 referring centres were enrolled in this study conducted by the German Multi-centre Study for 
Adult  ALL  group  (GMALL). The  median  age was  68 years. Twenty-eight  patients  were enrolled in 
the  imatinib  induction  arm  and  twenty-seven  in  the  chemotherapy  induction  arm.  All  patients  alive 
after induction received imatinib as part of the chemotherapy consolidation. 
Patients were well  matched for  age,  gender,  disease type,  bcr-abl breakpoint,  and  WBC and  platelet 
count at diagnosis. However, a complex karyotype was more frequent in the imatinib induction group 
(42% versus 25%). 
Response  to  induction  was  significantly  superior  in  the  front-line  imatinib  arm,  as  compared  with 
chemotherapy induction (p=0.003).  
-  Twenty-six of the 27 evaluable patients achieved a CR (96.3%) and one patient a PR (3.7%). One 
patient  was  not  evaluated  at  this  time  point  but,  like  the  PR  patient,  achieved  a  CR  after 
consolidation cycle C1.  
-  Thirteen  (50%)  of  the  26  evaluable  patients  enrolled  in  the  induction  chemotherapy  group 
achieved  CR,  two  patients  achieved  a  PR  (7.7%).  Nine  patients  (34.6%)  were  refractory  and  2 
patients died during chemotherapy induction; no patient failed imatinib induction.  
Significantly fewer patients in the INDchemo arm (n=6; 23.1%)  had recovered their ANC and platelet 
counts at the end of induction (p=0.008). Seven patients (26.9%) achieved a CRi after INDchemo, a PR 
was  recorded  in  2  patients  (7.7%).  Severe  adverse  events  were  significantly  more  frequent  during 
induction chemotherapy (90% vs. 39%; p=0.005).  
Of the 9 patients (34.6%) refractory to chemotherapy, 5 were crossed over to imatinib induction after 2 
weeks, while 4 patients received imatinib after completing INDchemo. Nine of the 11 poor responders (9 
refractory  and  2  PR  patients)  achieved  a  CR  in  response  to  imatinib,  two  crossover  patients  were 
refractory.  Taken  together,  100%  of  patients  randomized  to  INDIM  and  85.2%  (23/27)  of  patients 
randomized to the INDchemo arm achieved a CR, the latter group due to the efficacy of post-induction 
imatinib as “salvage” therapy in chemotherapy failures. 
Molecular response 
Prestudy  Bcr-abl  transcript  levels  in  bone  marrow  were  comparable  in  the  imatinib  induction  arm 
(median  1.1  x  10-2)  and  in  the  chemotherapy  induction  arm  (median  1.0  x  10-2).  During  induction 
4 
 
 
 
imatinib, bcr-abl transcript levels were significantly lower than during induction chemotherapy after 2 
weeks (2.6x10-4 versus 2.2x10-3; p=0.02) and after 4 weeks (5.6x10-5 versus 3.2x10-3; p=0.02).  
After  consolidation,  the  complete  molecular  response  rates  were  evenly  distributed  between  patients 
randomized to the imatinib induction (9 of 26 evaluable, 34.6%) and to chemotherapy induction (8 of 
22 evaluable, 36.4%) and appeared to occur earlier in the imatinib induction arm (96 days, range 30-
205 days) than in the chemotherapy induction arm (162 days, range 22-248 days) (p=0.187).  
Disease- free survival and overall survival 
Estimated median remission duration of the whole cohort is 15.7 months, 15 months in the imatinib 
induction group and the 19.9 months in the INDchemo group (p=0.54). At 12 months, the estimated 
probabilities  of  being  relapse-free  in  the  two  induction  groups  were  67.5±11%  and  70.8±11%, 
respectively. 
At  12,  18  and  24  months,  the  estimated  rates  of  DFS  in  the  whole  cohort  were  53.7%,  28.8%  and 
20.6%, respectively. Corresponding values for OS were 53.8%, 45.3% and 29.4%. The estimated rates 
of DFS and OS by induction treatment did not differ significantly between the two treatment groups.

Overall survival by induction type (study ADE10) 
A  complete  molecular  response  was  predictive  of  a  more  favourable  outcome  in  terms  of  remission 
duration  and  DFS.  Disease-free  survival  was  18.7  months  in  patients  achieving  PCR  negativity,  as 
compared  to  7.2  months  in  patients  who  remained  MRD  positive  (p=0.02).  Using  the  Kaplan-Meier 
method,  the  probabilities  of  DFS  in  the  good  and  poor  molecular  responders  were  74.3±11.1%  and 
41.5±9.6% after 12 months and 34.8±14.8% and 11.9±7.6% after 24 months. 
Relapse  was  associated  with  BCR-ABL  mutations  in  81%  of  patients.  Molecular  analysis  at  relapse 
was performed in 16 out of 21 relapsed patients. Of these, 13 patients had at least one bcr-abl mutation 
and 3 did not. All patients with at least one bcr-abl mutation and one patient without were on treatment 
with imatinib at the time of relapse.

Results 
The  comparison  of  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  does  not  indicate  major  differences  in  the 
population  treated.  Patients  received  imatinib  in  combination  with  induction  and/or  consolidation 
chemotherapy at doses of 400 mg/day (62 patients – 29%) or 600 mg/day (149 patients – 71%). Out of 
the 211 patients, 207 (98%) were patients with Ph+ ALL. 
−  Complete  haematological  response  (CHR)  rates  ranged  between  58%  and  95%.  The  lowest 
response  rate  was  observed  in  study  AAU02.  In  this  study,  patients  received  only  7  days  of 
imatinib  as  pre-induction  treatment.  Also,  in  study  ADE04,  no  difference  in  response  rate  was 
observed  between  cohort  1  and  cohort  2  after  induction  phase  II  (94%  vs.  95%,  respectively), 
despite  earlier  administration  of  imatinib  treatment  in  cohort  2.  This  could  be  explained  by  the 
different  response  rates  after  chemotherapy  induction  phase  I  (78%  of  the  patients  responded  in 
cohort 1 and only 56% in cohort 2).  
−  Of note, earlier administration of imatinib resulted in a higher molecular response rate. 
 [Study AAU02] The authors hypothesized that pre-treatment with imatinib would overcome inherent 
drug resistance to induction chemotherapy mediated by Bcr-Abl.

Among  22  evaluable  patients,  combined  imatinib  and  chemotherapy  induction  resulted  in  14  (64%) 
complete haematological responses and all but 1 patient achieved a major cytogenetic response. There 
were 7 (88%) complete haematological responses (CHR) among 9 evaluable patients with CML-LBC 
and relapsed Ph+ALL and 7 (58%) CHR among 12 de-novo Ph+ ALL.  
Major cytogenetic responses were seen in all newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL patients enrolled in the study. 
No molecular response was assessed in this study. 
The in-vivo inhibition of Bcr-Abl by imatinib was monitored in leukaemic cells during the imatinib-
only prephase using Western blot analysis of CrkL phosphorylation status. Marked dephosphorylation 
of CrkL  was observed in peripheral blood and/or  marrow in all but 1 of 8 evaluable cases.  Imatinib 
potently  inhibited  Bcr-Abl  activity  in  vivo  in  Ph+  acute  leukaemic  blasts  and  its  combination  with 
induction chemotherapy was tolerable. 
Neutrophils  recovered  to  ≥1.0x109/L  at  a  median  of  day  24  of  induction  chemotherapy,  with  only  1 
patient  showing  delayed  recovery  (>  day  42).  There  was  1  induction  death  on  day  18  from 
overwhelming  sepsis  and  multi-organ  failure.  No  unexpected  non-haematological  toxicities  were 
observed.

imatinib. The molecular response rate and duration were also evaluated.  
Therapy  was  given  with  8  induction-consolidation  courses  alternating  hyper-CVAD  with  high  dose 
MTX and ara-C, concurrently with 400 mg imatinib mesylate daily on days 1 to 14. Higher doses of 
imatinib were given during the  consolidation  phase  owing to  the  known  dose-response  phenomenon 
observed in the studies of imatinib in CML and the absence of concurrent myelosuppressive therapy.

From April 2001 to February 2004,  32 patients with Ph+ ALL have been treated (Thomas 2004b    ). 
Twenty-six  patients  had  active  disease,  either  untreated  (n=21)  or  refractory  (n=5)  to  one  induction 
course  without  imatinib.  Six  patients  were  in  CR  at  study  entry  after  one  induction  course  without 
imatinib mesylate. Median age was 48 years (range, 17–75); 59% were male. Five had CNS disease 
(16%).  
Twenty-five  of  26  patients  (96%)  with  active  disease  at  study  entry  achieved  CR  (1  failed  to  meet 
platelet criteria for CR). Median days to response were 21 days. Two of 26 patients (8%) required 2 
courses  to  achieve  CR.  Unexpected  toxicities  related  to  the  addition  of  imatinib  mesylate  were  not 
observed. 
Complete molecular remission (confirmed by nested PCR) was achieved in 3 (27%) of the 11 newly 
diagnosed  Ph+  ALL  patients  after  hyper-CVAD  and  imatinib  alone  and  in  12  (60%)  of  20  patients 
overall.  In  the  preliminary  data  reported  by  Thomas  et  al  on  the  first  20  patients  enrolled.  Bone 
marrow  cytogenetics  performed  at  CR  (approximately  day  21  of  the  induction  course)  showed 
normalization to diploid karyotype in 10 (91%) of the 11 patients. Levels of marrow quantitative RT-
PCR  positivity  (ratio  of  bcr-abl/abl  x  100)  less  than  0.05  occurred  in  8  of  the  15  patients  with  the 
hyper-CVAD and imatinib regimen alone.  
Allogeneic  stem  cell  transplant  (SCT)  was  performed  in  13  patients  in  CR  within  a  median  of  3 
months  from  start  of  therapy  (range,  1–12).  For  patients  unwilling  or  unable  to  undergo  allogeneic 
SCT, serial assessments of quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated stable to decreasing levels of Bcr-Abl 
transcripts over time, particularly with initiation of higher dose imatinib during maintenance therapy. 
Molecular response rate (negative bone marrow RT-PCR for bcr-abl confirmed by nested PCR) was 
approximately 50% in 19 pts who did not undergo allogeneic SCT. Disease free survival of the study 
group with  current follow-up was  not  different  whether  patients  were  censored  or  uncensored  at the 
time of allogeneic SCT (data not presented).  
There were 2 patients who discontinued protocol therapy for persistence or recurrence of Ph+ disease 
by routine karyotyping without evidence of overt ALL.  
Outcome  appears  better  with  the  hyper-CVAD  and  imatinib  regimen  with  2-year  DFS  rates  of  87% 
(all  pts)  compared  with  28%  for  hyper-CVAD  alone  or  12%  for  VAD  (p<.001).  After  a  median 
follow-up  of  2  years  (range,  4–36 months),  1  primary  refractory  patient  relapsed  at  12  months  (bcr-
abl/abl RT-PCR ratio <.05 at 9 months), 1 patient relapsed day 149 after matched related SCT despite 
negative nested PCR for bcr-abl, and 2 patients changed therapy after 5 months for persistent marrow 
Ph+ metaphases without overt leukaemia relapse.  
All but 5 of the 20 patients remained alive in CR with hyper-CVAD and imatinib-based therapy (9/10 
after hyper-CVAD and imatinib alone). Five patients died in CR, 3 older patients related to co-morbid 
conditions (2 were negative for bcr-abl by nested PCR) and 2 related to complications of allogeneic 
SCT.  Of  the  deaths  with  hyper-CVAD  and  imatinib  with  or  without  SCT,  two  were  related  to  ALL

relapse.  The  overall  survival  of  patients  treated  with  hyper-CVAD  and  imatinib  mesylate  was 
compared  with  those  treated  with  non–imatinib  mesylate–containing  hyper-CVAD  and  VAD 
regimens.  Differences  remain  significant  with  exclusion  of  the  5  patients  in  CR  at  start  of  hyper-
CVAD and imatinib mesylate (not shown). Note: a long-term survivor at 15 years in the VAD group is 
not shown.  
A comparison with historical controls was performed as part of [Study AUS01]. A significantly better 
outcome  of  patients  treated  with  hyper-CVAD  combined  with  imatinib  is  reported  than  with  either 
VAD  (31  patients)  or  hyper-CVAD  alone  (50  patients)  on  CR  rates  (P  <0.01),  DFS  (p <0.001),  and 
overall survival (p <0.001), [Study AUS01]. Of note, there was no significant difference in survival or 
DFS  with  censoring  at  the  time  of  allogeneic  stem  cell  transplantation  (SCT),  although  2  out  of  10 
patients  that  did  not  undergo  a  SCT  were  in  cytogenetic  response  on  imatinib  monotherapy 
maintenance for 2 years, but the historical rate of allogeneic SCT in first CR for Ph+ ALL was 20%, 
compared to 50% with imatinib.  
[Study  ADE04]  In  this  open-label,  multicentre,  uncontrolled,  non-randomised  phase  II  study,  the 
GMALL group investigated the safety and efficacy of imatinib in Ph+ALL or CML-LBC patients and 
the  minimal  residual  disease  after  induction  therapy  or  SCT.  This  study  was  divided  into  two  parts. 
Overall  80  to  100  patients  were  planned  (approximately  equal  distributions  between  the  post- 
induction group (study A) and the post transplant group (study B)). Patients with de novo Ph+ALL or 
CML-LBC  were  eligible  for  part  A  of  the  study  if  they  had  completed  phase  I  of  induction 
chemotherapy based on the GMALL protocols 06/99 or 07/01 irrespective of complete haematological 
remission and of haematological recovery.

Only results obtained in the Part A of this study will be discussed because few data evaluating the use 
of imatinib in the post-SCT setting are available. A total of 92 patients were enrolled in Study A.  
-  Cohort 1 encompasses 47 pts (median age 46 years (range 21-65), patients received imatinib at a 
daily oral dose of 400 mg (n=36) or 600 mg (n=12). Imatinib was initiated 18 days (5-52d) after 
completion of induction and given for a median of 28 days (13-176). 26 patients received a second 
imatinib cycle after the first consolidation cycle.  
-  Cohort 2 encompasses 45 patients (median age 41 years (range 19-63).  
Co-administration of imatinib with induction phase II resulted in a complete remission in 43 (95%) out 
of  45  patients  and  was  superior  to  the  alternating  administration  of  chemotherapy  and  imatinib  in 
terms of inducing PCR negativity for bcr-abl transcripts (52% versus 19%, p=0.01). 
BCR-ABL transcripts levels after induction phase I did not differ significantly in the two study cohorts 
(alternating or parallel schedule). The median BCR-ABL/GAPDH ratio was 4.5 x 10-4 versus 4.9 x 10-
4.  At  this  time  point,  the  percentage  of  patients  with  PCR  negativity  was  7%  for  the  alternating 
schedule  cohort  and  5%  for  parallel  schedule  cohort.  During  induction  phase  II,  minimal  residual 
disease  (MRD)  levels  decreased  by  a  median  of  0.9  log  with  the  alternating  schedule  i.e.  with 
chemotherapy  alone  (p=0.009)  and  by  1.6  log  (from  4.9  x  10-4  to  9.8  x  10-6)  with  simultaneous 
imatinib and chemotherapy (p<0.0001).  
BCR-ABL/GAPDH  ratios  at  the  end  of  induction  were  1.1  log  lower  in  patients  who  had  received 
induction phase II concurrently with imatinib, although this difference was not statistically significant 
(p=0.3). Similarly, the proportion of patients who were PCR negative at the end of induction phase II 
9 
 
therapy did not differ significantly between alternating and parallel treatments cohorts, reaching 26% 
and 27%, respectively. With both schedules, the 4-week post-induction imatinib cycle was associated 
with  an  additional,  approximately  1 log  decrease  of  BCR-ABL  transcript  levels  assessed  prior  to 
consolidation  (p=0.3).  Notably,  the  proportion  of  patients  in  whom  BCR-ABL  transcripts  became 
undetectable prior to consolidation increased to 52% in the parallel treatment cohort. This effect was 
not observed in the alternating treatment cohort. The difference in PCR negativity in the two treatment 
groups was statistically significant (p=0.01). 
The  authors  also  examined  whether  the  haematological  response  after  induction  phase  I  could 
influence  the  molecular  response  to  concurrent  imatinib  and  chemotherapy  induction  phase  II.  pre-
study BCR-ABL transcript levels were higher in patients with a poor response after induction phase I 
than in patients who had achieved a complete remission (median 7.6 x 10-3 versus 5 x 10-5 , p=0.0001). 
Following co-administration of imatinib and induction phase II, MRD levels decreased by a median of 
1.1 log in the prior good responders and by 2.2 log in the poor responders. When patients with a poor 
response and a good response to induction phase I were compared regarding their molecular response 
after  induction  phase  II  with  or  without  imatinib,  neither  median  MRD  levels  (median  5.3  x  10-5 
versus 3.8 x 10-6 , p=0.16) nor the proportion of patients who were PCR negative differed significantly 
(27%  vs  26%;  p=n.s).  These  data  indicate  that  in  newly  diagnosed  Ph+ALL,  a  poor  haematological 
response  to  the  initial  phase  of  remission  induction  chemotherapy  can  be  compensated  by  the 
subsequent administration of imatinib in combination with chemotherapy. 
No  patient  enrolled  in  the  alternating  schedule  cohort  relapsed  during  the  post  induction  imatinib 
cycle. Overall 40 (85%) of the 47 patients from this cohort underwent allogeneic (n=36) or autologous 
(n=4)  stem  cell  transplantation.  The  median  time  from  diagnosis  to  transplant  was  165  days  (range, 
103 to 287 days). Three patients relapsed while receiving imatinib after consolidation therapy, with a 
median remission duration of 4.9 to 6.2 months. Two patients who were not eligible for transplantation 
relapsed 7.6 and 12 months after imatinib was discontinued, the remission duration was 8.6 and 14.4 
months. One patient withdraw consent after consolidation and relapsed 6.4 months after imatinib was 
discontinued.  None  of  the  40  patients  enrolled  in  the  parallel  administration  schedule  cohort  who 
remained on study relapsed or died prior to consolidation therapy or stem cell transplantation. 
The  probability  of  subsequent  relapse  was  not  significantly  different  in  the  two  groups  of  patients 
(33% versus 19%; p-value: not significant). 
[Study AJP01] The JALSG has started this open-label, non-randomized, multi-centre, phase II study 
of imatinib administered concurrently to dose-intensive chemotherapy in newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL. 
This  study  was  conducted  with  patients  aged  between  15  and  64  years  with  newly  diagnosed  BCR-
ABL-positive  ALL.  Eligibility  criteria  included  adequate  functioning  of  the  liver  (serum  bilirubin 
level < 34.2 µM [2.0 mg/dL]), kidneys (serum creatinine level <152.50 M [2.0 mg/dL]), and heart (no 
severe  abnormalities  detected  on  electrocardiograms  and  echocardiographs),  and  an  Eastern 
Cooperative  Oncology  Group  performance  status  between  0  and  3.  Written  informed  consent  was 
obtained  from  all  patients  prior  to  registration.  The  primary  endpoint  of  this  study  is  the  complete 
remission rate. The secondary endpoints are the remission duration, DFS, OS, and the conversion rate 
and time to minimal residual disease negativity. Minimal residual disease is assessed by RT-PCR.

of 8 courses) 
A total of 80 patients were planned to be enrolled in this study. Interim results for the first 24 patients 
enrolled  were  presented  at  the  American  Society  of  Clinical  Oncology  meeting  in  June  2004.  Final 
results  on  the  eighty  patients  entered  into  the  trial  between  September  2002  and  January  2005  were 
reported by Yanada et al. 2005
. Median age was 48 years (range, 15 to 63 years).  
Induction therapy resulted in complete remission (CR) in 77 (96.2%) patients, resistant disease in one, 
and early death in two, as well as polymerase chain reaction negativity of bone marrow in 71.3%.  
The  profile  and  incidence  of  severe  toxicity  were  not  different  from  those  associated  with  our 
historical chemotherapy alone regimen.  
Relapse occurred in 20 patients (26%) after median CR duration of 5.2 months.  
Allogeneic  haematopoietic  stem  cell  transplantation  (HSCT)  was  performed  for  41  patients,  39  of 
whom underwent transplantation during their first CR.  
The 1-year event-free and overall survival rates were estimated to be 60.6%, and 76.1%, respectively, 
both of which were significantly better than those for the historical controls treated with chemotherapy 
alone (p<0.0001 for both).  
Among the current trial patients, the probability for OS at 1 year was 73.3% for those who underwent 
allogeneic  HSCT  and  84.8%  for  those  who  did  not.  When  only  patients  who  underwent  allogeneic 
transplantation  during  first  remission  were  analyzed,  compared  with  historical  controls  treated  with 
chemotherapy alone (ALL93, n=10), cases treated with imatinib-combined regimen (ALL202, n=39) 
showed better outcomes for event-free survival, but not for overall survival. When only patients who 
did  not  undergo  allogeneic  transplantation  were  analyzed,  compared  with  historical  controls  treated 
with  chemotherapy  alone  (ALL93,  n=22),  cases  treated  with  imatinib-combined  regimen  (ALL202, 
n=31) showed better outcomes for both event-free survival and overall survival. 
PCR  negativity  was  confirmed  for  18  (26.4%)  of  68  samples  on  day  28,  and  for  33  (50.0%)  of  66 
samples  on  day  63,  with  a  total  of  51  cases  (63.8%)  demonstrating  PCR  negativity  without  HSCT 
during the follow-up period. 
The  results  of  [Study  AJP01],  were  compared  with  the  results  of  study  JALSG  ALL93  conducted 
previously  by  the  same  collaborative  group.  This  historical  comparison  indicated  that  the  imatinib-
containing regimen induced a superior CR rate (96% versus 51% - p<0.0001), event-free survival and 
overall survival (p<0.0001). In concordance with study AUS01, the probability of survival was similar 
for  transplanted  patients irrespectively of  the  pre-transplant  regimen,  but was  significantly better  for 
the patients who did not undergo allogenic transplantation (p<0.0006).

[Study  AFR09]  open-label,  non-randomized,  multi-centre,  phase  II  study  post-induction  therapy 
(alternating imatinib plus steroids and chemotherapy) and  
[Study  AIT04]  open-label,  non-randomized,  multi-centre,  phase  II  study  in  combination  with 
steroids.  
The comparison of inclusion and exclusion criteria for these two studies with study ADE10 does not 
indicate major differences in the population treated. 
Out of the 49 patients, a total of 30 (61%) received imatinib at a dose of 600 mg daily. All patients 
were Ph+ ALL patients.  
The  complete  haematological  response  rate  in  the  overall  population  was  89%,  with  a  molecular 
response rate of 20% (26% in the evaluable population). 
[Study  AFR09]  In  this  open  label,  non  randomized,  multicentre,  phase  II  study,  the  Group  for 
Research  on  Adult  Acute  Lymphocytic  Leukaemia  (GRAALL)  investigated  the  effects  of  imatinib 
post-induction  therapy  in  elderly  patients  (>55  years)  with  Ph+  ALL.  Patients  were  treated  with 
steroids  during  one  week  and  then  offered  a  specific  therapy  including  treatment  with  steroids, 
cyclophosphamide,  daunorubicin,  and  vincristine  followed,  irrespective  of  response  to  induction 
therapy, by imatinib, 600 mg daily, combined with intermittent steroids during 2 months.  
From  January  2003  to  November  2004,  30  patients  aged  58  to  78  years  (median:  65.8  years)  were 
included in the study. The median follow-up of surviving patients was 15 months.  
Twenty-one (72%, CI: 52-87%) of the twenty-nine assessable patients were in complete response after 
induction chemotherapy vs 6/21 (28.5%, CI: 11-52%) in the historical controls (21 Ph+ALL patients 
treated by the same collaborative group in a previous protocol given similar induction chemotherapy 
but  with  no  steroids  before  chemotherapy  (p=0.003)).  Two  patients  died  during  chemotherapy 
induction treatment vs. none in the control group. 
Out  of  6  patients  alive  with  disease  at  completion  of  induction,  after  salvage  with  imatinib,  five 
additional  patients  were  in  complete  remission.  One  patient,  that  had  no  bone  marrow  assessment 
performed after induction and could therefore not be assessed for response, was in complete remission 
after consolidation therapy.  
In the control group, out of 12 patients offered salvage therapy after failing induction, four obtained a 
complete remission, while one died during salvage therapy. In the control group, six (28.5%, CI: 11-
52)  of  the  twenty-one  patients  were  in  complete  remission  (p=0.003),  and  15  were  alive  with 
leukaemia.  Overall,  27  (90%,  CI:  73-98)  of  the  30  patients  enrolled  in  the  AFR09  study  achieved  a 
complete remission versus 10 (47.6%, CI: 25.5-70) of the 21 patients in the control group (p=0.001). 
Molecular  response  was  assessed  in  15  out  of  21  patients  in  haematological  CR  after  induction 
therapy. Four patients were good molecular responders. After consolidation therapy, 13 (62%) of the 
21 CR patients were good molecular responders, 7 (33%) of them had BCR-ABL transcripts below the 
detection level. 
The projected overall survival is 68% at 1 year vs. 43% in the control group (p=0.001, log-rank test). 
The 1 year projected relapse-free survival is 59% vs 11% (p=0.001).  Out of the 8 non responders, one 
patient died from infection and one from sudden death and 6 were alive with leukaemia. 
[Study AIT04] In 2001, the Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche Maligne dell’Adulto (GIMEMA) 
started a phase II pilot study. The purpose was to verify the activity and safety of imatinib combined 
with prednisone during the induction phase in elderly (>60 years) Ph+ ALL patients.  
12 
 
 
As  of  May  2005,  out  of  the  19  patients  enrolled  (median  age:  69  years),  18  were  evaluable  for 
response and only 4 (21%) had a dose reduction of more than 50%. All 18 evaluable patients achieved 
haematological  CR  and  3/18  (17%)  had  a  complete  molecular  response  but  with  detectable  though 
small numbers of p190 BCR/ABL copies by quantitative RT-PCR.  
The BCR-ABL fusion transcript at diagnosis was measured by quantitative RT-PCR in 15 cases (11 
expressing the minor p190 transcript,  9 the  major p210 transcript, and one both). The median BCR-
ABL/ABL ratios were 1.7281 (range 0.9263-1.5617) in the p190 positive patients and 1.2094 (range 
0.2621-3.6730)  in  the  three  p210  and  the  single  p210+s90  cases.  In  these  15  cases,  the  BCR-ABL 
levels were also evaluated at the time of evaluation of response (after 45 days of treatment). At this 
time point, the median BCR-ABL/ABL ratios were 0.0018 (range 0.0005-0.0520) in the p190 group 
and 0.0210 (range 0.0099-0.0673) in the p210 or p210+190 positive group. By comparing the number 
of copies at diagnosis and after induction treatment, a median reduction of BCR-ABL/ABL ratios of 
2.8 logs (range 1.2-4.3) in the p190 group and 1.8 logs (range 0.5-2.5) in p210 or p210+190 positive 
group (Vignetti et al 2005
). 
BCR-ABL/ABL ratios at diagnosis and after 45 days of treatment in p210 (A) or p210+190 (B) positive groups 
(study AIT04) 
Six  patients  relapsed  after  a  median  time  of  6  months  (range  3  –  14.7),  and  10 patients  (56%)  were 
alive in continuous remission after a median duration of 14 months (range 2 - 26) from response. The 
projected  overall  survival  at  1  year  was  close  to  80%,  with  a  probability  at  2  years  close  to  50%. 
Moreover, imatinib given together with steroids was able to induce a marked reduction of the level of 
BCR/ABL copies which was highly predictive of the outcome, with a significantly lower probability 
of relapse for the p190 positive cases (n=11) in whom there was a ≥ 2.8 log reduction. 
Imatinib in Newly diagnosed elderly patients 
A total of 104 elderly patients with de-novo Ph+ ALL or CML-LBC were treated in combination with 
chemotherapy  and  or  steroids  within  one  controlled  study  (Study  ADE10)  and  two  uncontrolled 
studies (Study AFR09, Study AIT04). (table..) 
 Patients  received  imatinib  either:  as  monotherapy  (28  patients,  Study  ADE10),  as  combined 
consolidation  therapy  post  chemotherapy  induction  (27 patients,  Study  ADE10),  as  post-induction 
therapy  combined  with  steroids  (30  patients,  Study  AFR09)  or  as  induction  therapy  combined  with 
steroids  (19  patients,  Study  AIT04).  A  total  of  85  (82%)  of  these  patients  received  imatinib  at  a 
posology of 600 mg daily.

Efficacy conclusions on newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL 
In a controlled study of imatinib versus chemotherapy in 55 newly diagnosed elderly patients, imatinib 
used  as  single  agent  induced  a  significantly  higher  rate  of  complete  haematological  response  than 
chemotherapy (96.3% vs. 50%; p=0.0001). When salvage therapy with imatinib was administered in 
patients  who  did  not  respond  or  who  responded  poorly  to  chemotherapy,  it  resulted  in  9  (81.8%) 
patients out of 11 achieving a complete haematological response. This clinical effect was associated 
with a higher reduction in bcr-abl transcripts in the imatinib treated patients than in the chemotherapy 
arm after 2 weeks of therapy (p=0.02). All patients received imatinib and consolidation chemotherapy 
after  induction  and  the  levels  of  bcr-abl  transcripts  were  identical  in  the  two  arms  at  8  weeks.  As 
expected on the basis of study design, no difference was observed in remission duration, disease-free 
survival  or  overall  survival,  although  patients  with  complete  molecular  response  and  remaining  in 
minimal  residual  disease  had  a  better  outcome  in  terms  of  both  remission  duration  (p=0.01)  and 
disease-free survival (p=0.02). The role of resistance to imatinib in relapse is unclear. Thirteen out of 
16 evaluable patients relapsed in [Study ADE10] had a bcr-abl mutation at relapse, but it is not known 
if these mutations pre-dated imatinib treatment (Hofmann et al. 2003
). 
The  results  observed  in  a  population  of  211  newly  diagnosed  adult  Ph+  ALL  patients  treated  with 
imatinib  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  are  consistent  with  the  results  from  [Study  ADE10]. 
Imatinib in combination with chemotherapy induction resulted in a complete haematological response 
rate of 93% (147 out of 158 evaluable patients) and in a major cytogenetic response rate of 90% (19 
out of 21 evaluable patients). The complete molecular response rate was 48% (49 out of 102 evaluable 
patients). 
Similarly, in two clinical trials in which 49 newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL patients aged 55 years and over 
were  given  imatinib  combined  with  steroids  with  or  without  chemotherapy,  there  was  a  complete 
haematological response rate of 89% in the overall population and a complete molecular response rate 
of 26% in 39 evaluable patients. Median disease-free survival and median overall survival were longer 
than 1 year in both studies.

Only two studies had a CR rate lower than 90%: [Study AAU02] where imatinib was given for only 7 
days as  pre-induction treatment  and [Study AFR09] where imatinib  was  not  given  during  induction, 
but  only  during  consolidation.  Of  note,  in  this  latter  study  the  CR  rate  was  superior  to  historical 
controls. 
Comparison with historical controls treated at the same institution or by the same collaborative group 
on CR rates and time to events indicates an advantage of adding imatinib. 
Overall,  imatinib  demonstrated  activity  in  the  populations  treated,  with  a  consistent  high  level  of 
response  and  a  time  to  event  effect  that  is  equal  or  better  than  historical  controls.  The  lack  of 
differences in the time to event results in the only randomized study can be explained by the design of 
the  study  that  compared  imatinib  and  chemotherapy  only  in  the  induction  phase.  This  precludes 
conclusions  on  the  long  term  effect  of  either  approaches,  although  the  better  molecular  response  on 
imatinib might translate in a better long term outcome. 
2.2. RELAPSED AND/OR REFRACTORY PH+ ALL PATIENTS 
The  design  of  all  studies  performed  in  this  population  of  patients  was  open  and  uncontrolled.  The 
studies included the following populations: 
•  Patients in first or subsequent relapse after either standard chemotherapy, autologous or allogeneic 
bone marrow transplantation, or high dose treatment with peripheral blood stem cell support, or 
•  Patients  refractory  to  standard  chemotherapy  (no  complete  remission  achieved  after  two 
conventional induction chemotherapy). 
These  patients  were  treated  with  imatinib  as  monotherapy  or  in  combination  with  induction 
chemotherapy. 
Imatinib monotherapy 
Three Novartis-sponsored studies assessed the efficacy of imatinib as monotherapy in 429  relapsed or 
refractory Ph+ ALL patients:

− 
[03001], phase I, dose escalating pilot study  
(0109 CSR Ph+ ALL], open label, non-randomized, multi-centre, phase II study  
[0114 CSR Ph+ ALL]. phase II, multi-centre, expanded access study  
The inclusion and exclusion criteria for these studies were consistent according to the subpopulation 
targeted.

Time to progression 
A total of 429 relapsed/refractory patients with Ph+ ALL or CML-LBC were enrolled in these studies 
assessing the efficacy of imatinib as monotherapy. Out of these, 401 (93%) patients received imatinib 
at a dose of 600 mg daily. A total of 411 (98%) of the patient population were diagnosed as Ph+ ALL.  
15 
 
 
 
 
Study 03001  In this phase I Novartis sponsored dose escalating pilot study, 58 patients were enrolled, 
out of these, 20 patients were CML in lymphoid blast crisis (CML-LBC 10 patients) or Ph+ ALL (10 
patients). Of the 20 patients with lymphoid blast crisis or Ph+ ALL:  
4  (20%)  had  a  complete  haematological  response  (CHR)  and  10  (50%)  had  a  marrow  response.  In 
patients  who  showed  a  response  to  the  drug,  the  reduction  in  peripheral  blasts  typically  occurred 
within one week after initiation of the therapy. The median duration of therapy was 74 days (range 1–
349). Major cytogenetic responses were observed in patients with CML-LBC: complete response in 2 
patients, and partial response (defined as less than 35% Ph+ cells) in one patient. Of the 14 patients 
with  lymphoid  blast  crisis  or  Ph+  ALL  who  showed  a  response  to  imatinib,  12 relapsed  within  a 
median of 58 days after the initiation of treatment (range 42-123), one underwent allogeneic stem cell 
transplantation, one was still in remission after 243 days of imatinib. There was no obvious difference 
in response rates or the durability of responses between patients with lymphoid blast crisis and those 
with Ph+ ALL. 
Study 0109 Ph+ ALL: This subsequent phase II study was initiated to evaluate the clinical efficacy 
and  safety  of  imatinib  in  the  treatment  of  patients  with  CML  in  accelerated  phase  and  relapsed  or 
refractory  Ph+  ALL.  In  this  open  label,  non-randomized,  multi-centre,  multinational  Novartis-
sponsored trial, 56 patients (48 patients with Ph+  ALL and 8 patients in lymphoid blast crisis) were 
enrolled. For the purpose of this application, a sub-analysis was performed on these 56 patients and the 
results were split by age (< 55 years old, n= 38 and ≥ 55 years old, n=18). 
Patients were subdivided according to their initial dose of imatinib, 400 mg (10 patients) or 600 mg 
daily,  the  majority  (46  patients)  being  in  the  latter  initial  dose  group.  Patients  were  scheduled  to 
receive  treatment  for  24  weeks  and  then  were  continued  indefinitely  in  cases  where  the  investigator 
judged that further treatment was of clinical benefit. Simultaneous treatment with cytotoxic agents or 
steroids was not permitted. The primary efficacy endpoint of this study was sustained haematological 
response (lasting at least 4 weeks), defined as complete haematological response. Secondary endpoints 
were the induction of cytogenetic response, time to progression, and overall survival. 
Of the 48 patients with Ph+ ALL, 65% had experienced one or more relapses after prior chemotherapy 
and  35%  were  primarily  refractory  to  chemotherapy.  In  21%  of  the  patients  relapse  occurred  after 
autologous  or  allogeneic  stem  cell  transplantation.  Thus,  the  patients  selected  for  this  study  had 
particularly poor prognostic features. The median age was 50.5 years (range, 22-78 years). 
Efficacy. An initial dose of 400 mg was found not effective because no haematological responses were 
observed in patients treated at this dose level.  
Treatment  with  an  initial  dose  of  600  mg  daily  produced  sustained  haematological  responses  in  12 
them  achieved  sustained  CHR.  In  addition,  unconfirmed 
(26%)  patients.  Four  (33%)  of 
haematological responses were seen in 27 (59%) patients treated with an initial dose of 600 mg. The 
median time to haematological response was 1 month in the whole patient population. However, as a 
single  agent  the  median  duration  of  haematological  response  was  short  at  3.4  months  in  the  whole 
population. 
Confirmed major cytogenetic responses were seen in 12 (26%) out of 46 patients treated with 600 mg. 
Seven  (58%)  of  them  achieved  a  complete  cytogenetic  response  (CCyR).  Despite  the  fact  that  the 
study protocol permitted dose increases up to a total of 800 mg daily in all patients who failed to show 
an adequate therapeutic response, the rates of CCyR appeared to be dose-dependent with consistently 
higher rates of MCyR and CCyR in patients treated with an initial dose of 600 mg daily than in those 
receiving 400 mg daily. 
The median time to  progression (TTP) and  median survival in patients started  with  600  mg was 2.6 
months (95% CI: 1.9-3.0 months) and 5 months (95% CI: 4.2 -7.2 months), respectively. Parts of the 
results of this study have been published earlier (Ottmann et al 2002
). 
Study  0114  Ph+  ALL:  The  objective  of  this  open-label,  non-randomized,  multi-centre  trial  was  to 
provide  patients  with  Ph+  CML  in  accelerated  phase  (AP)  or  relapsed/refractory  Ph+  ALL  with 
expanded access to imatinib until the product was commercially available. The dosage was 600 mg 
daily  with  a  permitted  dose  escalation  of  up  to  a  maximum  of  800  mg  imatinib  per  day.  Eligible 
16 
 
patients (males/females, ≥18 years of age with Ph+ CML, in the accelerated phase of the disease, or 
relapsed/refractory Ph+ ALL) were treated in this protocol between 15-May-2000 and 03-Jun-2003. 
A total of 353 patients with relapsed/refractory Ph+ ALL were treated in this study. For the purpose of 
this application, a sub-analysis was performed on these and the results were split by age (<55 years, 
n=225 and ≥ 55 years, n=128). 
Overall,  211  of  the  353  patients  progressed  (discontinued  due  to  progression  or  death).  Time  to 
progression  (TTP)  was  censored  for  the  remaining  142  patients:  12  patients  discontinued  due  to 
adverse events, 2 had abnormal lab values, 62 discontinued to undergo BMT, 8 for reasons other than 
safety  or  efficacy  and  58  patients  were  still  on  treatment  when  transferred  to  national  health  care 
system  or  patient  assistance  programs.  The  estimated  proportions  [95%  CI]  of  patients  without 
progression was 12.4% [6 - 19] at 12 months. The median time to progression was 3.2  months with 
95% CI = [3 - 4]. 
At  time  of  analysis,  of  the  353  patients,  61  (17.3%)  patients  had  died  while  on  study  treatment,  17 
(4.8%)  patients  within  28  days  after  the  last  study  drug  administration  and  13 (3.7%)  patients  later 
than 28 days following discontinuation of study drug (mostly due to progression of disease). 
The estimated probabilities [95% CI] of being alive with Ph+ ALL was 40.8% [28 - 54] at 12 months. 
The  median  survival  was  8.9  months  with  95%  CI  =[7  -  NA]  in  patients  ≥55  years  old  and  11.4 
months with 95% CI =[6 - NA] in patients < 55 years old. 
Wassmann et al reported the results of an analysis performed in 68 patients with relapsed or refractory 
Ph+ ALL (n= 66)  or  minimal residual disease (n=  2) who  were  enrolled in study 0109  (n= 14)  and 
study 0114 (n= 54). Imatinib doses were 600 mg (n=63), 400 mg (n=4), or 300 mg (n=1). The overall 
haematological  response  rate  in  these  68  patients  was  close  to  70%,  with  30%  showing  complete 
haematological  response,  29%  showing  complete  marrow  response,  and  11%  in  partial  marrow 
response.  A  complete  cytogenetic  response  was  induced  in  89%  of  patients  in  CHR  and  77%  of 
patients in complete marrow response with sufficient cytogenetic and/or FISH data.  
However,  molecular  and  cytogenetic  remissions  were  rarely  sustained,  and  relapse  occurred  after  a 
median  of  4  months  (range,  0.5-5.0  months).  Median  TTP  in  patients  with  CHR  was  5.4  months, 
compared to 1.7 months in patients with a partial response (p < 0.0001). Overall survival of all patients 
was 22.6% ± 5.4% at 18 months. 
Imatinib in combination with chemotherapy 
Two  uncontrolled  phase  II  studies  provided  efficacy  data  of  imatinib  used  in  combination  with 
chemotherapy in a total of 14 relapsed/refractory Ph+ ALL or CML-LBC patients:  
• 
• 
[Study AAU02] open label, non-randomized pilot study that enrolled 7 relapsed/refractory patients 
with Ph+ ALL and 2 patients with CML-LBC to receive imatinib 600 mg/day in combination with 
induction chemotherapy  
[Study AUS01] study including 5 refractory Ph+ ALL patients treated with imatinib 400 mg/day 
in combination with induction chemotherapy (intensive hyper-CVAD).  
The two studies were comparable in terms of inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
A total  of 9 (64%) out of the 14 patients received imatinib at a dose of 600 mg daily. A total of 14 
(86%) of the patient population was Ph+ ALL.  
These studies are described in more detail as follows: 
[Study  AAU02]  The  authors  (Lickliter et al 2004
,Lickliter 2005  )  hypothesized  that  pretreatment 
with imatinib would overcome inherent drug resistance to induction chemotherapy mediated by Bcr-
Abl.  The  combination  was  evaluated  in  24  patients  with  Ph+  acute  leukaemias  (3  CML  in  myeloid 
blast crisis, 2 CML in lymphoid blast crisis, 7 relapsed Ph+ ALL and 12 de-novo Ph+ ALL).  
All patients received a 1-week pre-phase of imatinib alone at 600 mg daily.  
• 
In blast-phase CML and relapsed Ph+ ALL, imatinib was continued concomitantly with induction 
chemotherapy  (standard-dose  idarubicin/ara-C  with  vincristine/prednisone  added  for  lymphoid 
17 
 
leukaemias) for an additional week. Imatinib was then ceased, but recommenced as a single agent 
after blood-count recovery.  
•  Patients with de-novo Ph+ ALL received the imatinib pre-phase and then commenced the French 
cooperative group LALA-94 protocol without concomitant imatinib.  
Neutrophils  recovered  to  ≥1.0x109/L  at  a  median  of  day  24  of  induction  chemotherapy,  with  only  1 
patient  showing  delayed  recovery  (>  day  42).  There  was  1  induction  death  on  day  18  from 
overwhelming  sepsis  and  multi-organ  failure.  No  unexpected  non-hematological  toxicities  were 
observed.  
There were 7 (88%) complete hematological responses (CHR) among 9 evaluable patients with CML-
LBC and relapsed Ph+ALL and 7 (58%) CHR among 12 de-novo Ph+ ALL.  
Major cytogenetic responses were seen in all the evaluable patients (8/8, 100%). Complete cytogenetic 
responses were seen in 5 (63%) of patients (Lickliter et al 2005
). The in-vivo inhibition of Bcr-Abl 
by  imatinib  was  monitored  in  leukaemic  cells  during  the  imatinib-only  prephase  using  Western  blot 
analysis  of  CrkL  phosphorylation  status.  Marked  dephosphorylation  of  CrkL  was  observed  in 
peripheral blood and/or marrow in all but 1 of 8 evaluable cases. Imatinib potently inhibited Bcr-Abl 
activity in vivo in Ph+ acute leukaemic blasts and its combination with induction chemotherapy was 
tolerable. PCR negativity was confirmed for 18 (26.4%) of 68 samples on day 28, and for 33 (50.0%) 
of  66  samples  on  day  63,  with  a  total  of  51  cases  (63.8%)  demonstrating  PCR  negativity  without 
HSCT during the follow-up period (Yanada et al 2005
). 
Among all patients, the estimate one-year survival rate was 61.1 ± 13.5%.  
Study  AUS01  was  designed  to  determine  the  clinical  efficacy  (overall  response  rate,  event-free 
survival,  and  survival)  and  safety  of  the  intensive  hyper-CVAD  regimen  given  in  combination  with 
imatinib. The molecular response rate and duration were also evaluated. Adults (≥ 15 years) with Ph+ 
ALL,  newly  diagnosed  or  minimally  treated  (<2 courses  of  hyper-CVAD  or  conventional 
chemotherapy without imatinib) were eligible to enter this phase II trial of imatinib and hyper-CVAD 
conducted by the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. Entry criteria included ECOG performance status 0 
to 2. Patients with uncontrolled serious infections or  active secondary malignancy  were not  eligible. 
No  investigational  anti-leukaemic  therapy  could  have  been  administered  within  the  7  prior  days. 
Therapy  was  given  with  8  induction-consolidation  courses  alternating  hyper-CVAD  with  high  dose 
MTX and ara-C, concurrently with 400 mg imatinib mesylate daily on days 1 to 14. Higher doses of 
imatinib were given during the  consolidation  phase  owing to  the  known  dose-response  phenomenon 
observed in the studies of imatinib in CML and the absence of concurrent myelosuppressive therapy. 
From April 2001 to February 2004,  32 patients with Ph+ ALL have been treated (Thomas 2004b    ). 
Twenty-six  patients  had  active  disease,  either  untreated  (n=21)  or  refractory  (n=5)  to  one  induction 
course  without  imatinib.  Six  patients  were  in  CR  at  study  entry  after  one  induction  course  without 
imatinib mesylate. Median age was 48 years (range, 17–75); 59% were male. Five had CNS disease 
(16%).  
Complete molecular remission (confirmed by nested PCR) was achieved in 2 (50%) of the 4 refractory 
Ph+ ALL patients after hyper-CVAD and imatinib alone. 
Imatinib in elderly relapsed/refractory Ph+ ALL patients 
A  total  of  146  elderly  Ph+  ALL  or  CML-LBC  patients  were  treated  with  imatinib  as  monotherapy. 
These patients were enrolled in 2 uncontrolled Phase II studies:  
[0109 CSR Ph+ ALL], open label, non-randomized, multi-centre study 109  
[0114 CSR Ph+ ALL]. Multi-centre, expanded access study 0114  
142 (97%) out of the 146 patients received imatinib at a dose of 600 mg daily in studies 0109 and 014, 
which are described previously in this report.  The results obtained in the elderly population are shown 
in the table below:

Efficacy conclusions on relapsed/refractory Ph+ ALL 
When  imatinib  was  used  as  single  agent  in  patients  with  relapsed/refractory  Ph+  ALL,  in  the  66 
patients evaluable for efficacy, it resulted in a hematological response rate of 33% (12% complete) and 
a  major  cytogenetic  rate  of  23%.  The  median  time  to  progression  in  the  overall  population  of  429 
patients ranged from 1.9 to 3.1 months, and the median overall survival in the 409 patients evaluated 
from 5 to 9 months.  
In  14  patients,  imatinib  in  combination  with  induction  chemotherapy  resulted  in  a  complete 
hematological response rate of 92% in 12 evaluable patients and in a major cytogenetic response rate 
of 100% in 8 evaluable patients. Molecular response was assessed in four patients, and two responded 
completely. 
Treatment of Ph+ ALL patients aged 55 years and over was analyzed separately because of the lack of 
curative  treatment  for  this  population.  A  population  of  146  refractory  or  relapsed  patients  aged  55 
years and over received imatinib as monotherapy. Out of 14 evaluable patients treated with imatinib 
600  mg  daily,  complete  hematological  response  was  observed  in  5  patients  (35%)  and  major 
cytogenetic response in 7 patients (50%). Of note, four patients who were treated with a lower dose of 
imatinib  (400  mg  daily)  did  not  respond,  suggesting  that  this  dose  is  insufficient.  In  the  overall 
population  of  146  patients,  median  disease-free  survival  ranged  from  2.8  to  3.1  months  and  median 
overall  survival  from  7.4  to  8.9  months.  These  results  are  comparable  or  better  than  observed  with 
chemotherapy in a population of elderly newly diagnosed ALL patients. 
2.3. Pediatric patients with Ph+ ALL 
These results are included in this submission upon request of the EMEA  following CHMP  Scientific 
Advice of 17 February 2005. Data is presented from 5 pediatric patients with Ph+ ALL treated with 
imatinib in the phase I dose escalating pilot study (study 03001).  
In  Study  03  001,  included  in  previous  submission  dossiers,  a  total  of  eight  pediatric  patients  were 
treated  with  imatinib  at  doses  of  125  to  425  mg/day.  The  indication  and  main  criteria  for  inclusion 
were:  patients  <18 years  old  with  either  Ph+  CML  in  the  chronic  phase,  resistant  to  or  intolerant  of 
IFN, or Ph+ acute leukaemia (myeloid or lymphoid blast crisis, or Ph+ ALL or AML). Out of these 8 
children, five are presented here to be included in this application: 4 with Ph+ ALL and 1 with LBC. 
Data reported by Champagne et al in 10 paediatric patients treated in a phase I study conducted by the 
Children Oncology Group are also included. 
The  overall  hematological  response  in  these  two  studies  was  73%  (11  responders  out  of  15  patients 
treated),  with  a  CHR  rate  of  13%.  In  the  small  number  of  paediatric  patients  with  Ph+  leukaemia 
included in study 03 001, the efficacy of imatinib was broadly similar to that observed in adult patients 
with  similar  disease  types.  Three  out  of  the  five  treated  paediatric  patients  (60%)  achieved  either  a 
partial or a complete response. Out of the five-paediatric patients treated in Study 03001, two achieved 
a  complete  cytogenetic  response  and  one  a  minimal  cytogenetic  response.  In  the  phase  I  study 
conducted  by  the  Children  Oncology  Group  (COG),  among  these  10  patients  with  lymphoid 
phenotype 7 (70%) achieved M1 marrow responses and 1 (10%) achieved M2 response. The median 
survival for patients with advanced lymphoid leukaemia was 15 months.

2.4. Other sources of data 
Additional supportive data were provided by four publications that were not included in the overview 
of the data because audits were not performed. These publications are consistent with the previously 
assessed  studies  using  imatinib  in  Ph+  ALL:  the  two  first  publications  obtained  a  high  efficacy  in 
combination  with  chemotherapy  in  newly  diagnosed  patients,  which  made  possible  to  undergo  a 
transplant with a positive outcome. The other two publications describe studies with a shorter number 
of patients where it is more difficult to reach valid conclusions 
3. 
Safety Aspects 
The safety of imatinib in this indication was evaluated on the basis of the results from clinical trials 
performed  in  two  populations  of  patients:  newly  diagnosed  Ph+  ALL  patients  (previously  untreated 
patients who received imatinib in combination with induction and/or consolidation chemotherapy) and 
relapsed/ refractory Ph+ ALL patients (where imatinib was used as a single agent). 
Additionally,  the  safety  of  imatinib  was  analysed  as  a  separate  entity  in  patients  ≥55  years  old  with 
Ph+  ALL  (usually  not  considered  suitable  for  intensive  therapy  including  allogeneic  or  autologous 
bone marrow transplantation), which formed part of the main population of the study. 
The  information  submitted  includes  a  total  of  758  patients.  However,  the  data  from  investigator-
initiated  studies  was  extracted  from  manuscripts,  and,  therefore,  much  information  is  missing.  Data 
from serious adverse events reports submitted to the applicant are also presented (cut-off date: 31-Jul-
2005). 
When available, frequency, type and severity of the adverse events (AE) and serious  adverse  events 
(SAE), rate of deaths, laboratory results were considered. All patients who received at least one dose 
of imatinib were considered in the safety evaluation. 
The company states that blinding was not feasible due to the complexity of the chemotherapy regimen 
used to treat  Ph+  ALL patients,  and that large  randomized  studies  were not feasible,  either  due to a 
combination of the rarity of the disease and the variety of chemotherapy used. 
No pooling of data or combined safety analysis was performed, since the company considered that the 
clinical trials presented in this application were conducted in patients at different stages of the disease, 
as  well  as  in  patients  treated  with  imatinib  and  different  chemotherapy  regimens.  Duration  of 
treatment, dose intensity, and dose exposure in the different populations are very heterogeneous. 
3.1. Adverse events 
Relapsed/refractory Ph+ ALL 
Description of AE by system organ class (SOC) is available only for studies 0109 and 0114, therefore 
only  existing  for  imatinib  monotherapy  in  relapsed/refractory  Ph+  ALL.  Study  0109  was  a  phase  II 
study  and  study  0114  was  part  of  an  expanded  access  program.  As  stated  by  the  applicant,  safety 
information for study 0114 was not consistently collected and AE rates are therefore much lower. 
The  overall  frequency  of  patients  experiencing  adverse  events  was  remarkably  higher  in  study  0109 
(100%)  versus  study  0114  (37.7%).  The  most  frequently  affected  SOC  were  gastrointestinal  (94.6% 
and 21.2% of patients, for studies 0109 and 0114 respectively), and general disorders (with 82.1% and 
19%  of  patients,  respectively).  Other  frequently  affected  SOC  for  study  0109  were:  infections 
(60.7%),  skin  disorders  (58.9),  musculoskeletal  (55.4%)  and  respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal 
disorders (55.4 %). Blood and lymphatic system disorders were reported in 53.6 % of patients. 
The most common grade 3 or 4 AE by SOC in study 0109 and study 0114 were related to blood and 
lymphatic  system  (42.9%  and  15%,  respectively),  infection  (21.4%  and  4.5%,  respectively)  and 
general disorders (17.9% and 7.9%, respectively). 
The frequency of AE by SOC was similar in patients aged under and ≥ 55 years, except for a slight 
increase  in  study  0109  for  general  and  administration  site  conditions  (76.3%  versus  94.4%),  eye 
(21.1% versus 33.3%) and psychiatric disorders (18.4% versus 38.9%). 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Most  frequent  treatment  related  AE  in  study  0109  (mostly  grades  1  and  2)  were  nausea  (76.8%), 
vomiting (62.5%) and peripheral oedema (33.9%). Drug related AE for study 0114 were not collected 
and  are  not  submitted.  In  study  03001,  most  frequent  treatment  related  AE  (imatinib  monotherapy) 
were nausea (55%), vomiting (41%) and oedema (41%). No information of overall AE or AE split by 
age is available for this study. 
The  rates  of  most  frequent  AE  and  most  frequent  treatment  related  AE  (nausea  and  vomiting)  were 
also similar for the population ≥ 55 years, followed by peripheral oedema (50 %) in study 0109. 
Newly diagnosed patients 
No information is available on the distribution of adverse events by SOC from the published studies. 
The most frequent adverse events reported were infections of different types, reported in 23 out of 91 
post-induction courses (25%) followed by fatigue and peripheral neuropathy (reported in 8 and in 7 of 
the post-induction courses, respectively). Fluid retention was reported in 6 patients (grade 1-2 in five 
of them) and increase in hepatic enzymes and creatinine in 5 patients (grade 1-2 in all of them). No 
induction mortality was observed.  
In the rest of the publications, only grade 3 or 4 events were reported and these events were mostly 
summarized for the entire treatment period.  
3.2. Serious adverse events and deaths 
Refractory/relapsed patients 
In the overall population of 423 refractory/relapsing patients included in studies 0109 and 0114, there 
were  only 6 deaths considered  due to  adverse  events  (4/56 in  study 0109  and  2/353 in  study 0114); 
none  was  considered  drug-related.  An  underreporting  of  deaths  is  unlikely  in  study  0114,  but  is  not 
discarded  by  the  applicant  either.  Out  of  the  14  patients  in  studies  AAU02  and  AUS01,  3  died  on 
study.  One  of  these  patients  died  from  hemoptysis  due  to  a  fungal  pneumonia,  another  from 
Aspergillus  pneumonia  and  the  third  of  them  from  osteomyelitis  from  vertebroplasty  for  traumam-
related vertebral fracture. 
Discontinuation  due  to  adverse  events  was  20  %  in  study  0109,  the  main  reason  being  general 
disorders.  Discontinuation  occurred  in  5%  of  patients  in  study  0114,  mainly  due  to  progressive 
disease. 
Serious  adverse  events  were  common,  with  99  patients  treated  with  imatinib  monotherapy 
experiencing  a  SAE  (24%).  As  expected,  the  frequency  of  SAE  is  again  much  lower  in  study  0114 
(17%)  than  in  study  109  (68%).  The  most  frequently  SOC  affected  by  SAEs  in  study  0109  was 
progressive  disease  (36%  SOC  neoplasm),  followed  by  infections  (27%)  and  general  disorders  and 
administration site conditions (21.4%), while in study 0114 it was general disorders (6%), followed by 
blood & lymphatic systems disorders (4.5%) and infections (4%). Causality is not provided. 
SAEs in AAU02 and AUS01 were not reported by disease group.  
The  rate  of  patients  who  presented  SAE  was  slightly  higher  for  patients  ≥  55  years  in  study  0109, 
compared  to  patients  under  55  years  (77.8%  versus  63.1%),  including  grades  3  or  4  (66.7%  versus 
55.3%), while it was similar in study 0114. The rate of patients ≥ 55 who discontinued treatment due 
to  AE  was  higher  (27.8  %)  when  compared  to  the  population  under  55  (15.8%)  in  study  0109. 
Neoplasms (i.e. disease progression) were the most common reason for premature discontinuation of 
therapy. No such difference was detected in study 0114. 
Newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL 
In the overall population of 315 newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL patients, a total of 26 patients (8.2%) died, 
13  of  them (4.1%)  of adverse  events.  No  death  was  attributed to study  drugs, although the  different 
follow ups are provided in each study. A total of 70 patients (22.2%) discontinued treatment because 
of adverse events. SAE were reported  with variable frequency,  depending  on  the regimen  combined 
with  imatinib.  The  lowest  frequency  (4%)  was  reported  in  study  AJP01,  and  the  highest  (81%)  in 
study  AUS01  that  used  a  high-dose  chemotherapy  regimen  in  combination  with  imatinib.  The  most 
frequent  SAEs  were  related  to  the  SOC  infection  and  infestation  in  studies  AUS01  (56%),  AAU02 
(50%), AFR09 (10%) and APJ01 (1%), and to the nervous system in study AIT04 (11%). 
21 
 
For the ≥ 55 year population, the incidence of SAE in study ADE10 was lower in the chemotherapy 
induction  arm  than  in  the  imatinib  induction  arm  (100  %  versus  39.2%).  SAEs  during  imatinib 
monotherapy  were  not  considered  drug  related,  the  most  frequent  being  neutropenic  fever  in  two 
patients  and  nausea  and  vomiting  in  two  patients.  The  rate  of  reported  SAES  were  similar  in  study 
AFR09  (30  %)  and  in  study  AIT04  (26.3%),  although  most  frequent  SAES  in  study  AFR09  were 
infections (10%) versus peripheral neuropathy (10.5%) in study AIT04. 
3.3 Laboratory findings 
Relapsed/Refractory Ph+ ALL patients 
In  relapsed/refractory  patients  most  frequent  adverse  events  as  regards  laboratory  findings  with 
imatinib  monotherapy  were  anaemia  (43%  and  8%  in  study  0109  and  0114  respectively), 
thrombocytopenia  (30%  and  7%)  and  neutropenia  (18%  and  10%).  Duration  of  grade  3  or  4 
haematological abnormalities ranges  usually between 1-4 weeks. The  haematological  adverse  events 
from studies AAU02 and AUS01 are not split by stage of disease, and therefore are discussed in the 
newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL patients section. 
Haematological  profile  was  similar  in  patients  under  55  years  and  in  patients  ≥  55.  Only 
thrombocytopenia  was  more  frequent  in  the  group  of  patients  under  55  years  (28.9%  versus  16.7  % 
respectively). The median time to first CTC grade 3 or 4 neutropenia in patients treated with imatinib 
600  mg  was  about  35  days  in  patients  under  55  years  old  and  8  days  in  older  patients. 
Thrombocytopenia was seen for the first time at a median of about  15 days in < 55 years old and 4 
days in older patients. The hematological profile in patients under and ≥ 55 years is comparable. 
Regarding  biochemistry  findings,  a  total  of  6  patients  (11%)  experienced  liver  toxicity.  Of  these,  3 
patients (5%) from study 0109 experienced a grade 3 elevated SGPT. Two patients experienced Grade 
3  elevated  alkaline  phosphatase  and  1  patient  had  Grade  3  elevated  bilirubin.  No  Grade  3/4  liver 
toxicity is reported in study AAU02 and study AUS01, although an increase of transaminases to Grade 
1/2  and  of  bilirubin  to  Grade  1/2  was  reported  in  5  cycles  of  therapy.  No  worsening  increase  in 
transaminases or bilirubin CTC grade 3 or 4 was seen in patients ≥ 55. 
An  increase  in  creatinine  to  Grade  1/2  in  5  cycles  and  an  instance  of  hyponatremia  Grade  3/4  were 
also reported as adverse events in study AUS01. 
Newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL patients 
Regarding haematology, the only data that was consistently reported is time to recovery. No delayed 
hematological  recovery  is  reported  in  studies  AFR09  and  AIT04,  and  persistent  neutropenia  was 
reported  in  two  patients  in  study  AJP01.  In  study  ADE04,  cohort  2,  the  duration  of  grade  3  or  4 
thrombocytopenia  and  neutropenia  was  12  days  (range  3-57)  and  16  days  (range  3-47  days), 
respectively.  In  study  AJP01,  the  median  time  to  white  blood  cells  recovery  was  19  days  and  the 
median time to platelet recovery was 22 days. The median time to haematological recovery after each 
cycle  of  chemotherapy  with  the  hyperCVAD  and  imatinib  regimen  was  not  different  from  the  prior 
regimens. 
There is in general little information about laboratory findings within the published studies as they are 
mainly  focused  on  liver  toxicity,  although  in  some  studies  the  effect  on  the  related  target  organ  is 
presented as an AE. No Grade 3 or 4 liver toxicities were reported in any study with the exception of 
AJP01, where one patient experienced a Grade 3/4 liver toxicity and in study ADE04, where transient 
Grade 3/4 non-hematological toxicity was observed. 
3.4.  Other evidence 
Since  2001  the  post  marketing  experience  has  been  reviewed  on  an  ongoing  basis  in  the  Periodic 
Safety Update Reports (PSUR). Based upon cumulative reviews in the most recent PSUR version 6 it 
was recommended to continue to monitor the following events: myocardial infarction, cardiomegaly / 
thrombosis/embolism,  pulmonary  hypertension,  hepatic 
cardiomyopathy, 
necrosis/cirrhosis,  disseminated 
coagulation,  glucose  metabolism  disorders, 
rhabdomyolysis, hemolytic anemia, suicide attempt, -ideation and suicide. 
angina  pectoris,

Review of published literature 
No safety data are provided by (Lee S et al 2005). Lee KH et al (2005) reported that all patients had 
grade 4 neutropenia with febrile neutropenia in 10 patients, requiring antibiotics treatment. One patient 
died  of  septic  shock  on  day  14  of  treatment.  Bone  marrow  recovery  was  anyhow  not  delayed.  Four 
patients experienced a Grade 3 or higher hyperbilirubinemia that resolved after the interruption of both 
L-asparaginase  and  imatinib.  Other  Grade  3  or  4  toxicities  (nausea,  epigastric  pain,  myalgia,  liver 
enzyme abnormalities and weight gain) were reported in a few patients. Shimoni et al 2003 reported a 
total of 8 patients with Ph+ ALL or lymphoid blast crisis out of 15 patients treated with imatinib 600 
or 400mg as  single agent  either as treatment of refractory disease or  maintenance while a transplant 
donor  was  found.  Imatinib  was  generally  well  tolerated,  with  a  few  patients  developing  bone  pain, 
muscle  cramp  and  fluid  retention.  A  high  incidence  of  severe  liver  toxicity  was  observed  after  the 
transplant  procedure.  The  contribution  of  imatinib,  continued  until  a  few  days  before  this  high  dose 
chemotherapy to this toxicity, is unclear. 
3.5.  Safety in special populations 
Elderly patients 
No subgroup analysis in elderly population, considered as ≥ 65 years, is submitted. 
The  safety  information  regarding  patients  ≥  55  years  has  already  been  commented.  No  major 
differences were detected in the analysis by subgroup when compared to the population under 55. Out 
of  250  patients  belonging  to  this  age  category  70  (28%)  died;  31  (21%)  out  of  146  with 
relapsed/refractory  disease  and  14  (13.5%)  out  of  104  with  newly  diagnosed  disease.  None  of  the 
deaths  reported  in  relapsed/refractory  patients  was  attributed  to  adverse  event,  while  a  total  of  4 
patients  (3.8%)  with  newly  diagnosed  diseased  and  treated  with  a  combination  of  imatinib  and 
chemotherapy died of adverse event.  
Serious  adverse  events  were  reported  in  34  patients  (23%)  out  of  146  treated  with  imatinib 
monotherapy and in 52 patients (50%) out of 104 treated in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy 
and/or  steroids.  Half  of  these  SAE  was  reported  in  the  parallel  schedule  cohort  from  study  ADE04. 
The most frequently affected SOC by SAE were general disorders, blood and lymphatic disorders and 
infections  with  imatinib  monotherapy  and  infection  and  infestation,  hepatobiliary  disorders  and  the 
nervous system with the combinations. 
A  total  of  24  patients  discontinued  due  to  adverse  events  (9.6%),  12  patients  treated  with  imatinib 
monotherapy (8.2%) and 12 treated in combination with chemotherapy or steroids (11.5%).  
Paediatric patients 
Five patients under 18 received imatinib in study 03001.  
Nausea and vomiting were observed in all patients and were the most frequently reported AE with a 
suspected  relationship  to  the  study  drug.  No  patients  experienced  grade  3  or  4  AE  or  SAE  with  a 
suspected 
to  study  drug.  One  patient  developed  grade  4  neutropenia  and 
thrombocytopenia and one patient developed grade 3 cytopenia.  
relationship 
As part of a study in all Ph+ leukemias, imatinib was administered to children under the age of 18 with 
Ph+  relapsed  or  refractory  Ph+  ALL  or  Ph+  CML  in  lymphoid  blast  crisis  (Champagne  2004).  The 
starting dose was 260 mg/m2. The imatinib dosage in subsequent cohorts was escalated in approximate 
30 % increments from 260 to 340, 440 and 570 mg/m2. Sixteen patients received imatinib for at least 6 
months and 8 for at least 12  months. Premature discontinuation  occurred in  13 of 17 with advanced 
myeloid or lymphoid leukaemia. Eleven of them died with evidence of refractory or recurrent disease, 
two additional patients  died of disease  recurrence following  stem cell transplantation. The  results of 
this paediatric study were described in the ISS of Glivec® for treatment of children with Ph+ CML. 
The  safety  profile  in  this  paediatric  population  was  comparable  to  that  in  adults  with  the  notable 
exceptions of a much lower incidence of musculoskeletal complaints and of superficial edema. There 
were no new safety findings. Nausea and vomiting were the most frequent AE, although they were less 
23 
 
 
 
frequent than in adults (nausea 4%, vomiting 3.5 %, fatigue 3.5 %, increased in hepatic enzymes 3%). 
Data on laboratory values are not available. 
Due to the potential risks to the human fetus, women of childbearing potential were advised to avoid 
becoming pregnant and to use effective contraception during treatment. No cases of pregnancies were 
reported. 
Discussion on Safety 
Even though no major deviations were expected, the only Novartis sponsored study where information 
was consistently collected was study 0109. Relevant data can also be obtained from study 0114 and 
non-Novartis studies, although limitations intrinsic to this kind of evidence, such as underreporting of 
AE, are present. 
Nevertheless,  the  safety  profile  of  imatinib  is  consistent  with  that  expected  in  ALL  population 
(refractory and relapsing patients or newly diagnosed in combination with chemotherapy) and seems 
not  different  either  from  that  seen  previously  with  imatinib  treatment  in  other  disease  populations. 
Apparently, when  administered in combination with chemotherapy, no synergic  effect  regarding AE 
seems to have been evidenced with the only possible exception of hepatotoxicity. A precaution on the 
concomitant use of other hepatotoxic drugs, as suggested by the applicant, needs to be added on the 
SPC.  However,  the  limited  amount  of  information  makes  a  further  discussion  of  drug  interactions 
necessary. 
Even though the safety and efficacy analysis in the population ≥ 55 years, who usually cannot benefit 
from a bone marrow transplant, is essential in order to properly perform an adequate benefit-risk ratio 
in this population with unquestionably specific needs, a subanalysis of data of patients over 65 years 
might  have  been  informative  and  is  expected.  Otherwise,  a  downward  bias  regarding  safety  in 
traditionally considered elderly population cannot be discarded. 
Overall Discussion and Benefit-Risk Assessment  
The  prognosis  of  adult  patients  with  newly  diagnosed  Ph+  ALL  treated  with  chemotherapy  is  poor, 
with  a  less  than  10%  probability  of  long-term  survival.  Complete  Remission  rates  with  standard 
chemotherapy in younger patients range from 60-90% with a median CR duration of about 12 months.  
The  present  application  is  intended  to  seek  approval  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  newly 
diagnosed  Philadelphia  chromosome  positive  acute  lymphoblastic  leukaemia  (Ph+  ALL)  integrated 
with  chemotherapy,  and  relapsed  or  refractory  Ph+  ALL  as  monotherapy.  A  total  of  758  Ph+  ALL 
patients with either newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory were enrolled in ten clinical studies, nine 
of which were open-label, non-randomized, phase II studies and only one was randomized.  
Glivec  at  the  proposed  regimen  demonstrated  adequate  efficacy  and  safety.  The  value  of  imatinib 
seems clear regarding the positive effect mainly on cytogenetic and molecular responses, and there is a 
well-characterized  biological  basis  to  support  its  use  in  this  disease.  The  use  of  imatinib  in 
combination  with  chemotherapy  allows  a  higher  percentage  of  patients  to  get  a  bone  marrow 
transplant  that  might  be  a  curable  therapy  for  this  disease.  However,  the  majority  of  the  presented 
studies have important flaws that preclude meaningful conclusions regarding the value of imatinib in 
the  long-term  time-to-event  variables,  such  as  disease-free  survival  or  overall  survival  for  Ph+  ALL 
patients. The groups in the different studies are in general scarce and very heterogeneous concerning 
not  only  the  disease  status  but  also  in  the  schedule  the  imatinib  is  used  with  chemotherapy,  either 
prior, concomitant or post-chemotherapy.  Therefore, it is not currently known the optimal schedule of 
imatinib in combination  with chemotherapy  in the different phases of  ALL treatment,  i.e.  induction, 
consolidation and maintenance, and whether imatinib treatment should be prolonged after the classical 
2-year  maintenance  therapy.  The  high  remission  rate  obtained  with  imatinib  treatment  leads  to  a 
higher  proportion  of  candidates  to  receive  a  transplant,  which  is  an  adequate  surrogate  for  clinical 
benefit.  In  the  transplant  setting  there  is  also  positive  preliminary  data  with  imatinib,  but  questions 
such  as  the  potential  use  of  imatinib  in  the  conditioning  regimen  or  the  post-transplant  optimum 
schedule remain to be answered. 
24 
 
 
 
Relapsed/  refractory  Ph+  ALL  is  also  a  disease  situation  in  which  there  are  no  effective  treatments 
available;  therefore,  new  effective  drugs  are  needed.  In  this  population  of  relapsed  or  refractory 
patients,  imatinib  in  monotherapy  produced  a  response  rate  that  can  be  considered  relevant: 
approximately 60% of patients achieved a remission or clearance of blasts with about 20% complete 
haematological remissions and 25% of major cytogenetic responses. Disappointingly, these responses 
have  a  very  short  duration  and  overall  survival  was  only  a  few  months;  the  clinical  benefit  of  these 
results  are  not  clear,  due  in  part  to  the  absence  of  an  appropriate  comparator.  The  elderly  patients’ 
results are positive and consistent with that of the whole studies population, which is interesting for a 
drug  with  a  good  tolerability.  As  the  studies  submitted  used  imatinib  600  mg  in  combination  with 
different  chemotherapy  schedules  obtaining  positive  results  and  there  is  no  standard  therapy,  the 
proposal to use imatinib concomitantly with Ph+ ALL chemotherapy is acceptable. 
As the experience with imatinib is limited, further investigations of the use of imatinib in combination 
with chemotherapy are recommended to improve current outcomes.  
The company does not propose to conduct more studies in this indication. Other studies with imatinib 
in Ph+ ALL patients must also be presented.   
The  paediatric  data  submitted  in  this  application  are  clearly  insufficient.  Taking  into  account  the 
interest of having adequate treatments in this age group and also the currently authorised indication of 
CML blast crisis in children, there is a  solid rationale to support the interest of this use of imatinib. 
The MAH is required to provide more data in Ph+ ALL in children.  
Clinical  safety  concerns  were  also  resolved  satisfactorily.  Until  more  information  is  available,  a 
warning about the use of imatinib in combination is included in the SPC. 
In conclusion, the positive efficacy and safety clinical results obtained with imatinib were apparently 
more  consistent  in  the  newly  diagnosed  Ph+  ALL  population  than  in  the  relapsed/refractory  group. 
The results were superior to those obtained with chemotherapy in the historical controls without added 
toxicity  and  allowed  more  patients  to  get  a  bone  marrow  transplant.  The  evidence  presented  can  be 
considered sufficient to grant the proposed new labelling. 
The  changes  proposed  for  the  SPC  are  in  accordance  with  the  updated  studies  results  and  reflect 
adequately the comments made by the CHMP.

Description 
1.  The  paediatric  data  submitted  in  this  application  are  clearly 
insufficient.  Taking  into  account  the  interest  of  having  adequate 
treatments  in  this  age  group  and  also  the  currently  authorised 
indication  of  CML  blast  crisis  in  children,  there  is  a  solid 
rationale to support the interest of this use of imatinib. The MAH 
is required to provide adequate data in Ph+ ALL in children or, in 
its absence, an investigation plan of imatinib in Ph+ ALL should 
be provided to the CHMP. 
-  Novartis  will  follow-up  on  any  investigator-initiated 
trials  in  pediatric  Ph+  ALL  patients  and  will  keep  the 
EMEA  informed  about  any  additional  data  in  this 
patient population as part of the annual re-assessment. 
-  With  reference  to  the  new  EU  guidance  on  paediatrics,  as 
soon  as  the  Paediatric  committee  will  be  in  place,  Novartis 
will  approach  the  committee  with  a  proposal  within  the

Paediatric Investigational Plan (PIP) for Glivec. 
In  relapsed/refractory  Ph+  ALL  patients,  the  use  of  imatinib  in 
monotherapy, although promising, is not completely satisfactory; 
therefore,  combination  with  chemotherapy  should  be  further 
investigated  in  order  to  optimise  the  results  in  this  patient 
population.  
Preliminary data is known utilizing imatinib in combination with 
chemotherapy in this population.  However, the use of imatinib in 
combination with chemotherapy in newly diagnosed patients with 
Ph+ALL is increasing and these patients will likely be refractory 
to  imatinib  therapy  if  they  suffer  a  relapse.    Additionally,  new 
second  generation Bcr-Abl inhibitors have  demonstrated activity 
in this imatinib refractory setting.  For this reason Novartis does 
not  feel  that  launching  further  investigations  to  optimize  the

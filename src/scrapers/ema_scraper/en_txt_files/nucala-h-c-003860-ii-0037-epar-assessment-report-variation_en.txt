Extension of indication to include hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) for Nucala (mepolizumab); as a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 (in addition 6.6 for the powder for solution for 
injection only) of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 7 of 
the RMP has also been submitted.  
In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder took the opportunity to update the local representative 
in the PL. 
The variation requested amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet 
and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included (an) EMA Decision(s) 
EMEA-P/0384/2020 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At  the  time  of  submission  of  the  application,  the  PIP  P/0384/2020  was  not  yet  completed  as  some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Mepolizumab was granted an Orphan Drug designation for HES (EU/3/04/213) on 29 July 2004. On 24 
September 2020, the MAH submitted a request to withdraw the Orphan Drug designation ahead of the 
submission of this type II variation. The removal of the designation was anticipated to allow the 
indication to be added on to the Nucala Marketing Authorisation indicated currently for severe 
eosinophilic asthma. 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) did not submit a critical report addressing the 
possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan 
medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

Opinion 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
HES is a group of rare hematologic disorders without a known cause in which eosinophils are 
overproduced in the bone marrow for prolonged periods of time. The sustained overproduction of 
eosinophils in the bone marrow results in high blood eosinophil levels (eosinophilia). When activated 
eosinophils from the bloodstream infiltrate various tissues, they cause inflammatory tissue damage 
and dysfunction. 
Inadequate HES treatment can lead to profound end-organ damage and increased mortality. 
The International Cooperative Working Group on Eosinophil Disorders (ICOG-EO) uses the following 
definition for HES: (1) blood eosinophilia of >1500 eosinophils/μL on 2 examinations (at an interval ≥1 
month, except in case of life-threatening organ-damage when diagnosis can be made immediately) 
and/or tissue eosinophilia; (2) organ damage and/or dysfunction attributable to tissue eosinophilia; 
and (3) exclusion of other disorders or conditions as the major reason for organ damage [Valent, 
2012b; Kahn, 2017]. HES is only diagnosed when organ damage and/or dysfunction are present. 
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
The proposed indication is related to Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) as follows: 
Nucala is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome. 
Posology:  
Adults: The recommended dose of mepolizumab is 300 mg administered subcutaneously once every 4 
weeks. 
Children aged less than 18 years old: The safety and efficacy of mepolizumab in adolescents and 
children aged less than 18 years old have not yet been established. Currently available data are 
described in section 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. 
Epidemiology  
HES is considered a rare disease under EU legislation (defined as those affecting fewer than 5 in 
10,000 people in the EU). Mepolizumab has been granted Orphan Drug Designation in the USA and in 
the EU on 29 July 2004 (EU/3/04/213); however, the MAH withdrew the Orphan Drug Designation in 
the EU. 
Assessment report  
EMA/560938/2021  
Page 8/140 
 
 
 
HES is a rare and under-diagnosed disorder, making it difficult to estimate overall prevalence. Reliable 
estimates of the prevalence and/or incidence of HES are not readily available in the literature, and 
calculation of a meaningful prevalence estimate is difficult, as most publications are case reports or 
case series which lack a population denominator. 
Using the MAH database in the United Kingdom (UK), the estimated prevalence of patients diagnosed 
with HES in 2018 was estimated to 0.8 cases per 100,000 persons and the estimated incidence rate 
was 0.14 per 100,000 person-years.  
Biologic features 
The natural history and prognosis of HES depends on the HES variant. The ability to distinguish these 
different variants is critical for optimal patient management because the clinical manifestations and 
response to treatment vary considerably depending on the aetiology of eosinophilia. Clinically, the 
most frequent classifications are myeloproliferative (M-HES); lymphocytic (L-HES), and idiopathic HES. 
M-HES is a clinically defined variant characterized by an extreme male predominance, pathologic 
evidence of eosinophil-related tissue damage and tissue fibrosis, elevated serum tryptase levels, and 
myeloproliferative features, including splenomegaly, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, bone marrow 
hypercellularity with reticulin fibrosis, and increased numbers of atypical mast cells. 
The identification of the FIP1L1-PDGFRα (F/P) fusion tyrosine kinase genetic translocation in the 
majority of patients with M-HES led to a dramatic improvement in prognosis for these patients due to 
response to imatinib (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor) treatment. The prevalence of the F/P mutation in the 
total HES patient population was found to be between 11% and 18% [Ogbogu, 2009; Helbig, 2010]. 
Therefore, for the majority of HES patients that are F/P negative, no definitive genetic basis underlying 
their disease has been identified. 
Identification of L-HES rests upon recognition of distinct helper T cell subsets (Th1 and Th2) and clonal 
overgrowth of specific cytokine-producing cells, particularly production of IL-5 by Th2 cell clones. The 
most prevalent T cell clone associated with L-HES appears to be the CD3-CD4+ clone. Although 
patients with L-HES typically do not show the same high incidence of life-threatening end-organ 
damage compared with M-HES, L-HES patients are at higher risk for developing peripheral T-cell 
lymphomas. Reported estimated incidence rates vary widely due to the small sample population from 
“rare”, to 5% up to 14 to 25%. In a study of F/P negative HES patients, 21% were diagnosed with L-
HES. In a retrospective study of 21 French patients with CD3- CD4+ L-HES and negative for the F/P 
mutation, 1 lymphoma occurred (5%) during the mean follow-up duration after HES diagnosis of 
6.95.1 years. 
Idiopathic HES describes cases of unknown cause that does not meet criteria for any of the other 
variants. It is estimated that more than 60% of patients with HES fall into this category. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
HES is a chronic disease that has been found to be associated with a high degree of morbidity and 
mortality [Schwartz, 2010]. As a heterogeneous disease, signs and symptoms of HES vary widely 
depending on specific organ involvement. Symptoms may range from non-specific to organ- or life-
threatening. Many patients have 2 or more organ systems affected [Ogbogu, 2009; Helbig, 2010]. The 
most common reported clinical manifestations of HES are: 
•  Constitutional: fever, night sweats, weakness, malaise, weight loss, myalgia 
Assessment report  
EMA/560938/2021  
Page 9/140 
 
 
 
•  Dermatologic: pruritus, dermatitis, angioedema 
• 
Pulmonary: asthma, persistent non-productive cough, dyspnea 
•  Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea 
•  Cardiac/thromboembolic: congestive heart failure, mitral regurgitation, intracardiac thrombus, 
myocardial ischemia, arrhythmias 
Management 
Important goals of HES therapy are to decrease symptoms and blood eosinophil levels in order to 
achieve disease control. The current approach is based on reduction of blood eosinophilia, reduction of 
active inflammation, suppression of the immune response, and treatment of disease-specific and/or 
treatment-related complications. 
Standard of care (SoC) therapy for patients with HES includes corticosteroids (for F/P negative or F/P 
positive with cardiac involvement at diagnosis) or imatinib (for F/P positive) as first-line therapy and 
cytotoxics (e.g., hydroxyurea, cyclophosphamide) or immunomodulators (interferon alpha, 
cyclosporine, immunoglobulin) as second-line agents . Clinical responses to these therapies, however, 
are incomplete or inadequate in over 80% of HES patients (among those negative for F/P mutation). 
The discovery of the F/P mutation in patients with M-HES and its response to imatinib has improved 
survival and QoL in this subpopulation. For most patients however, the only currently available 
treatment options are limited to chronic high doses of corticosteroids, and cytotoxic agents such as 
hydroxyurea and cyclophosphamide. The efficacy of these agents, even in combination, is not always 
adequate and side effects from long-term use are significant. Additional agents with increased efficacy 
and decreased toxicity are therefore greatly needed. 
Although not approved for use in HES, corticosteroids are used in clinical practice as first-line 
treatment for most patients with HES due to lack of available options. The therapeutic strategy is to 
start with a moderate to high dose (≥40 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) and taper very slowly while 
monitoring the blood eosinophil count closely. Using this approach, most patients (85%, N=141) will 
respond initially to steroid therapy based on a decrease of blood eosinophil count to normal range and 
symptomatic improvement. However, many HES patients (72%, N=179) will need to be maintained on 
low steroid doses (median 10 mg/day) for long periods of up to 20 years since discontinuation of 
corticosteroids leads to eosinophilia and symptomatic recurrence in most patients. 
Although the initial response to corticosteroid treatment is often positive, long-term use of oral 
corticosteroids (OCS) is associated with significant and commonly reported side effects, including 
truncal obesity, moon facies, buffalo hump, increased blood pressure, water retention, decreased bone 
density, weight gain, muscle atrophy, hyperglycemia, delayed wound healing, cataracts and glaucoma, 
peptic ulcers, and increased risk of infection. Therefore, with chronic use, the toxicities of steroid 
therapy become more significant, patient adherence diminishes, and additional or alternative 
corticosteroid-sparing therapies must be used. The chronic use of corticosteroids is often discontinued 
(42%, N=179) or used in combination therapy (33%, N=179) due to toxicity or failure in the majority 
of HES patients. 
Discontinuation or inadequate treatment with HES therapies increases the risk of worsening symptoms 
and/or increased blood eosinophils. 
In the absence of approved targeted therapies for HES, several of the second-line agents 
(chemotherapeutic agents such as hydroxyurea, IFNα, and other cytotoxics [e.g., cyclosporine, 
vincristine, methotrexate, and busulfan]) have been used based on empirical observational evidence of 
Assessment report  
EMA/560938/2021  
Page 10/140 
 
 
 
benefit. These second-line agents are effective (defined as a decrease of eosinophil count and 
symptomatic improvement) only in a small number of HES patients, are associated with significant 
toxicities, have a slow onset of therapeutic effect, and confer an increased risk of patients developing 
malignancy. For example, the most commonly used second-line agent, hydroxyurea, is rarely useful as 
a single agent and its side effects and lack of efficacy result in discontinuation in the majority of 
patients (77%, N=64). 
Despite significant advances in the understanding and management of HES, there remains the need for 
effective, well-tolerated treatments to control the disease and minimize the toxicities from chronic use 
of corticosteroids and second-line agents. This unmet medical need persists in particular for F/P 
negative HES, which comprises the majority (85%) of the HES patient population, due to the absence 
of a highly effective, well-tolerated therapy suitable for long-term use. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Mepolizumab is a humanized IgG antibody (IgG1, kappa) with human heavy and light chain 
frameworks. The functional protein is a disulfide-linked tetramer consisting of two light (kappa) and 
two heavy (IgG1) chains. There is a single glycosylation site on each heavy chain. The complementary 
determining regions (CDRs) were grated from the murine antibody, 2B6, by molecular genetics 
techniques. 
Mepolizumab is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody which binds to IL-5 with high affinity (Kd=185 
pM) and specificity, thus preventing IL-5 from associating with the receptor α-chain of the IL-5 
receptor complex expressed on the eosinophil cell surface and thus inhibiting IL-5 signalling. 
Neutralization of IL 5 leads to a reduction in the production and survival of eosinophils but does not 
appear to affect other immune cells including T cell activation, distribution of CD4/CD8 subtypes or 
Th1/Th2 cytokine patterns, B cells, NK cells or T cells. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The clinical development program to support an indication for the use of mepolizumab in adult patients 
with HES was based on a single pivotal Phase III study, 200622. This study was a randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled study which investigated the efficacy and safety of mepolizumab in the 
treatment of adolescent and adult subjects. The study comprised a 32-week treatment period in which 
subjects received 300 mg mepolizumab subcutaneously (SC) every 4 weeks and an 8-week follow-up 
period.  
Subjects who completed study 200622 were eligible for a 20-week open-label extension (OLE) study, 
205203. During the extension treatment period, all subjects received 300 mg mepolizumab SC every 4 
weeks, and their standard HES therapy could be adjusted per SoC. 
The MAH had previously conducted a Phase III study, MHE100185 (completed in 2006), and its OLE 
study, MHE100901 (completed in 2010), in subjects with HES. Study MHE100185 compared the 
efficacy and safety of 750 mg mepolizumab administered intravenously (IV) every 4 weeks for 36 
weeks with placebo in terms of the reduction in OCS dose (to 10 mg or less per day for 8 or more 
consecutive weeks) and the reduction in blood eosinophilia (to <600 eosinophils/μL for 8 or more 
consecutive weeks). The initial marketing authorization application (MAA) for mepolizumab in HES was 
submitted in September 2008 and was based on study MHE100185. While this study showed greater 
reductions in OCS dose for mepolizumab compared with placebo, the application was withdrawn in July 
Assessment report  
EMA/560938/2021  
Page 11/140 
 
 
 
2009 as the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) did not consider the data 
available at that point in time conclusive of a positive risk/benefit balance for mepolizumab in HES. 
Based on studies MHE100185 and MHE100901 as well as a mepolizumab dose-response (blood 
eosinophils) meta-analysis across multiple eosinophilic indications, a 300 mg SC dose was selected for 
investigation in patients with HES. With this information, study 200622 was designed to investigate 
mepolizumab 300 mg SC in a representative population of HES subjects with a clear definition of HES 
flares for efficacy assessment. HES flares were considered to be a clinically meaningful endpoint to 
assess the treatment effect of mepolizumab in this population. 
The MAH also has an ongoing mepolizumab HES EAP which comprises the Initial Compassionate Use 
Program, MHE104317, a Named Patient Supply (NPS) Guidance Program, and treatment protocol 
MHE112562. The ongoing HES EAP offers mepolizumab to previous HES study participants as well as 
patients with life-threatening HES who demonstrated failure to standard therapy. As of the most recent 
clinical data cut-off date of 01 March 2019 for the interim HES EAP clinical study report (CSR), 359 
patients have received mepolizumab in the HES EAP. Understanding the limitations of an open-label, 
uncontrolled EAP (non-placebo/active), the available data offers supporting evidence of long-term 
safety with mepolizumab for patients with severe HES (non-responsive or intolerant to alternative 
therapies). 
The MAH obtained two SAs from the CHMP in relation to the use of mepolizumab in patients with HES 
i.e. EMEA/H/SA/436/2/FU/2/2014/PA/II and EMEA/H/SA/436/2/FU/3/2016/PA/II.

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Pharmacology 
No new studies have been performed. An overview has been provided discussing the mechanism of 
action of mepolizumab to inhibit IL-5 signalling, reducing the production and survival of eosinophils 
and thereby a scientific rationale for potential efficacy in the proposed indication. This is adequate. 
2.2.2.  Toxicology 
No new studies have been submitted and juvenile toxicity studies have not been conducted with 
mepolizumab. The available non-clinical data support administration of mepolizumab to paediatric 
patients from birth. A juvenile toxicity study would not provide additional relevant safety data.   
2.2.3.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Being natural proteins, therapeutic antibodies such as mepolizumab, are not excreted unchanged and 
do not give rise to metabolites with potential biological activity. In view of this, guidance on the 
environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use (CHMP/SWP/4447/00) specifically 
exempts amino acids, peptides and proteins from the need for a complete environmental assessment 
and, therefore, no further assessment of mepolizumab drug substance has been undertaken. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Based on the updated data submitted in this application, the new/extended indication does not lead to 
a significant increase in environmental exposure further to the use of mepolizumab.  
Assessment report

Considering the above data, mepolizumab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.  
2.2.5.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Based on the updated data submitted in this application, the new/extended indication does not lead to 
a significant increase in environmental exposure further to the use of mepolizumab.  
Considering the above data, mepolizumab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
No concerns are raised from non-clinical point of view for new indications in proposed dosing regimen 
and aimed patient population. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
Table 3: Tabular overview of clinical studies  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Two placebo-controlled clinical studies in the rare disease HES were conducted during mepolizumab 
clinical development program: i) an initial Phase III adult study (MHE100185) completed in 2008 that 
investigated mepolizumab at a dose of 750 mg administered intravenously and ii) a single pivotal 
Phase III adolescent and adult efficacy study (200622), investigating a 300 mg SC dose of 
mepolizumab, which was conducted to support this indication submission. The sparse PK samples 
Assessment report

collected in the initial Phase III HES study following IV administration (MHE100185) were included in 
the population PK meta-analysis of adult IV data from early studies in multiple diseases and again in 
the more recent population PK meta-analysis across studies, routes of administration and eosinophilic 
diseases, that were submitted previously. 
Absorption 
Mepolizumab subcutaneous absorption is slow, with an absolute bioavailability of 74 to 80% following 
injection in the arm in adults or in adults/adolescents, a Tmax of 4 to 8 days, and an absorption half-
life of 1 to 2 days.  
Distribution 
Mepolizumab distributes into a volume of approximately plasma and interstitial space (55 to 85 mL/kg).  
Elimination 
Mepolizumab is catabolized by ubiquitous proteolytic enzymes and does not undergo target-mediated 
clearance. 
Mepolizumab is eliminated with a systemic clearance of 0.22 L/day (for 70 kg subject; or 3.1 
mL/day/kg) and has a SC terminal-phase elimination half-life of 16 to 22 days, with two-fold 
accumulation following repeat dosing every four weeks, consistent with the long half-life.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The pharmacokinetics of mepolizumab are linear, dose-proportional, and time-independent after both 
intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) administration. 
Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
Sparse PK samples were collected throughout study 200622. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled study to investigate the efficacy and safety of mepolizumab in the treatment of adolescent 
and adult subjects with severe hypereosinophilic syndrome. Three blood samples per subject for the PK 
analysis of mepolizumab concentrations were taken pre-dose at Week 4, Week 16, and Week 32 visits. 
A PK sample was also taken at the early withdrawal visits and at the additional follow-up visit, when 
applicable. Fifty-four subjects were randomized to the mepolizumab group and all contributed to the 
159 concentrations included into the analysis. 
Thirty of the 54 mepolizumab-treated subjects were female. The median age was 48 years (range: 12 
to 82 years). The median bodyweight at Screening was 75 kg (range: 35 to 171 kg). The median 
baseline creatinine clearance (CRCL) was 111 mL/min (range: 46.4 to 196 mL/min). The majority of 
the subjects had normal renal function. No mepolizumab-treated subjects had severe (CRCL <10 
mL/min) renal impairment, one subject had moderate (CRCL <50 mL/min) renal impairment and 6 
subjects had mild (CRCL >50 to <80 mL/min) renal impairment. 
Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
The impact of continuous and categorical covariates on individual parameter estimates was examined 
by visual inspection. Considering the small sample size of mepolizumab-treated subjects in the study 
(54 subjects) and the narrow range of values for some covariates, the covariate investigation is overall 
considered of limited value. The apparent trend observed for bodyweight, CRCL, and albumin, was 
already accounted for into the model. After considering co-linearity and plausibility, there was no 
Assessment report  
EMA/560938/2021  
Page 15/140 
 
 
 
 
 
apparent obvious trend in any other covariates. No refinement of the model was therefore deemed 
necessary. 
Model goodness of fit, as demonstrated by conventional plots and Normal Prediction Distribution Error 
(NPDE), are shown below:

Final model performance was also assessed using VPC (see model visual predictive check below), with 
incorporation of parameter uncertainty and bootstrap resampling of subject covariates.  
Figure 4: Model Visual Predictive Check (Semi-log plot) 
In order to evaluate the concordance between the predicted and observed plasma concentrations in 
the study, individual plasma concentration predictions were generated against which the model was 
validated prospectively, using goodness of fit tests. Based on the following tests: Shapiro-Wilk, 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Cramér–von Mises and Anderson-Darling, there was no evidence at the 5% 
significance level to suggest that the observations and predictions were drawn from different 
distributions.

Figure 5: PK Model Goodness of fit Statistics Showing Observation (red) 
It was therefore concluded that the recent meta-analysis population PK model was able to accurately 
predict mepolizumab plasma concentrations in an HES population following SC administration. 
The range of the predicted individual clearance (CL) values in the study, obtained by post-hoc 
Bayesian approach, was 0.11 to 0.69 L/day (note: population CL estimate for a 70 kg subject is 0.21 
L/day). A slight increase in CL was seen with increasing body weight, as anticipated, which is not 
considered clinically significant. The box plots of CL versus age, CRCL and ADAs (absence or presence) 
showed no major difference by visual inspection. 
Accumulation ratios for repeat dosing were calculated using individual observed Ctrough values at 
Week 16 and Week 32 compared with Week 4. Approximately 2-fold accumulation is observed from 
Week 4 to Week 16, with only a further marginal increase at Week 32. Steady-state was therefore 
achieved around Week 16, as evidenced by the ratio of approximately unity for the comparison of 
Week 16 with Week 32. 
Immunogenicity 
None of the subjects in the placebo group tested positive for ADAs at any time. One subject in the 
mepolizumab group tested positive for ADAs at any time post Baseline (2%, 1/53). Another subject in 
the mepolizumab group tested positive for ADAs at Baseline only (2%, 1/54). None of the subjects 
were positive for NAbs. The presence of anti-mepolizumab antibodies did not influence mepolizumab 
PK discernibly. 
The impact of the presence of ADAs on the blood eosinophil count profiles was assessed by visual 
inspection (see below). Out of the 2 subjects ADA positive in the study, one subject initially displayed a 
marked decrease in blood eosinophil counts up to Week 4, after which counts gradually increased to 
return to baseline levels during the remainder of the study treatment period.

Figure 6: Observed Blood Eosinophil Count-Time Profiles (ADA Positive versus ADA Negative 
Subjects) 
Special populations 
No conventional special Clinical Pharmacology studies were conducted due to the nature of the 
molecule, its mechanism of action and elimination pathways. 
Age, race, gender and disease are not covariates of mepolizumab exposure. Dose adjustments in 
special populations other than children (i.e., elderly, renal- and hepatic-impaired subjects) are not 
required.  
Based on the population PK analysis (Study 200622), a slight increase in CL was seen with increasing 
body weight in patients with HES, which was not considered clinically significant. Of the four 
adolescents enrolled into the study, one adolescent was randomised to mepolizumab treatment (300 
mg SC). The exposure in this 12-year old adolescent of 35 kg was at the upper range of the exposure 
observed in the study.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No interaction studies have been performed. The potential for drug-drug interaction is deemed low 
because IL-5 does not signal via hepatocytes. 
Bioanalytical methods 
Two placebo-controlled studies and 3 open-label uncontrolled studies are included in this 
Hypereosinophillic syndrome (HES) indication submission. These studies were conducted at different 
time periods of the mepolizumab clinical development program. Blood samples for evaluation of 
mepolizumab and serum IL-5 were only collected in studies 200622 and MHE100185, while 
immunogenicity was assessed in studies 200622, 205203, MHE100185 and MHE100901.  
The history of the assays life cycle, in particular the bridging between the PK assays, can be found in 
initial severe asthma MAA and is briefly summarised in the below respective sections of the 
assessment report.

Analytical methods for the evaluation of Mepolizumab Plasma Concentrations.   
For the first phase III HES study MHE100185, the PK assay utilized a sandwich ELISA with a 
recombinant human IL-5 capture and protein G fluorescent detection. This assay was also initially used 
in the open-label study MHE100901, which later used an assay validated with a drug specific anti-
immunoglobulin G HRP detection conjugate. Both validated assays had similar quantitation ranges (50 
– 5000 ng/ml vs 50 – 2500 ng/ml, respectively). For clinical studies supporting the initial severe 
asthma application, the PK assay was validated at a clinical research organisation (CRO) and utilised a 
neutralising idiotypic antibody specific for the drug as the capture reagent (50 – 5000 ng/ml). This was 
the same PK assay used to support HES studies 200622 and 204203. Although different PK assays 
were used across the HES studies, the PK assays were bridged to allow for concentrations comparison 
across studies.  
Clinical studies 205203 and 200622 
The measurement of mepolizumab plasma concentrations for clinical studies 205203 and 200622 was 
carried out using method 111202M01 (version 6). This method is the same as the method used during 
the initial MAA procedures for the lyophilised and liquid formulations. The full validation report 
including addenda for method 111202M01 was included in the original MAA.  
For assay runs to be acceptable, no more than one-third of the QC samples could deviate from the 
nominal concentration by more than 20% with %CV ≤ 20% In addition, at least 50% of the results 
from each QC concentration had to meet the aforementioned criteria for accuracy and precision. There 
are also additional assay acceptance criteria in place for the calibration curve accuracy and precision.  
Analytical method for IL-5 
Biomarker analysis for IL-5 concentration was performed by Quest to support HES study MHE100185. 
Since then, the assay for IL-5 concentration determinations was developed and validated to support 
clinical studies in the initial severe asthma application. This IL-5 biomarker was assay used during HES 
study 200622.  
Method validation parameters include specificity (interference from mepolizumab), matrix 
effect/selectivity, prozone effect, dilutional integrity, precision (inter- and intra-), accuracy, stability in 
matrix and upper/lower limit of quantitation. A summary of the method validation is presented below 
in Table 4.

are also additional assay acceptance criteria in place for the calibration curve accuracy and precision.  
Analytical methods for the evaluation of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) 
The initial HES study MHE100185 was supported with the 3rd generation binding ADA assay and 2nd 
generation NAb assay. The open-label study MHE100901 was supported with the 4th generation binding 
ADA assay and the 3rd generation NAb assay. The validated 3rd generation NAb assay was also used to 
support the clinical studies in the initial severe asthma application and the liquid mepolizumab 
application, before being validated. The 6th generation binding ADA assay included an anti IL 5 blocking 
antibody and was validated at GSK to support the clinical studies in the initial severe asthma 
application.  
The 6th generation binding ADA assay and 3rd generation NAb assay were used to support HES studies 
200622 and 205203. While studies 200622 and 205203 used the same binding ADA and NAb assays 
that supported the initial severe asthma application, the earlier assay formats were never bridged to 
allow for comparison of immunogenicity incidences between studies.  
Clinical study MHE100185 
The 3rd generation binding ADA assay was used which is a bridging immunoassay that employed 50 µl 
of human serum sample and equimolar amounts of biotinylated SB240563 and BV-TAG Plus labelled 
mepolizumab as bridging reagents. Immune complexes are bound to streptavidin-coated parametric 
particles and ECL is measured.  
The method validation addressed the following parameters: precision (inter- and intra-), specificity, 
stability, drug tolerance and sensitivity. Assay precision was determined across low (80.0 ng/ml), mid 
(800 ng/ml) and high (8000 ng/ml) quality controls. Intra- assay precision (% CV) was ≤ 13.3% and 
inter-assay precision was ≤ 16.4%. Human serum samples containing low and high levels of anti-
mepolizumab antibodies were stable (within 20% of untreated controls) following exposure of the 
samples to either 4 hours at room temperature or 1-5 freeze-thaw cycles. Drug tolerance curves 
indicate that the assay can measure positive antibody responses in the presence of approx. an 8-fold 
excess of mepolizumab. Antibody at 625 ng/ml was measurable in the presence of up to 5 µg/ml of 
drug and 2500 ng/ml antibody could be detected in the presence of up to 20 µg/ml of drug. The 
sensitivity of the method was approx. 100 ng/ml.  
The assay cut point was determined using 60 human serum samples. The (signal to background) S:B 
ratios of the samples related to the negative control pool were statistically evaluated for estimation of 
the positive/negative cut-off. Five samples were excluded as outliers, based on their values exceeding 
the mean + 3 SD value for the assay. The remaining samples were used to define the cut-point as the 
highest S:B ratio that would achieve the desired 5% false positive rate. The assay cut point was 
defined as 1.97, which is very close to the theoretical mean + 1.65SD (95th percentile statistic). The 
confirmation cut point is defined as ≥ 40% inhibition in the presence of excess drug. Titer was defined 
as the reciprocal of the last dilution at which the sample measured above the 1.97 cut-point.  
Clinical study MHE100901 
The 4th generation binding ADA assay (TLIAM-0084) was used to screen samples from study 
MHE100901. According to this method, diluted samples are incubated with biotinylated mepolizumab 
and ruthenylated (“sulfo tag”) mepolizumab. Bridging immune complexes are formed if ADA is present. 
The incubated sample is transferred to a streptavidin coated MSD plate and read buffer is added which 
causes the sulfo tag to produce a chemiluminescence signal when voltage is applied. Samples are 
Assessment report  
EMA/560938/2021

considered negative if the response is less than or equal to the assay cut point. Positive samples are 
tittered and/or confirmed by a drug inhibition assay.  
Table 5 : Method validation summary for ADA assay TLIAM-0084  
The screening cut point was determined using serum from 60 healthy donors and 30 HES subjects. 
Relative ECL data was provided, as the ratio of ECL/NC. Outliers were excluded using boxplots and Q-Q 
plots. The relative ECL data was log transformed and analysed using variance components analysis. 
The normality assumption is reasonably satisfied and the cut off was then derived at the 5% false 
positive rate (95th percentile around normal distribution). The confirmation cut point was calculated 
using the parametric approach to determine the upper 99% limit. To accomplish this, 20 randomly 
selected healthy individual human serum samples were spiked with PC antibodies at the relative 
sensitivity level with and without drug.

Clinical studies 205203 and 200622 
The ADA method used is the same as the method used during the line extension for the liquid 
formulation although minor revisions have been made throughout the method. The sample analysis 
reports for studies 200622 and 205203 are provided in documents 2019N407648-00 and 
2019N407651-00, respectively.  
Analytical methods for evaluation of neutralising antibodies (NAbs) 
Clinical study MHE 100185 
The 2nd generation NAb was used to evaluate samples during clinical study MHE100185. This is a 
competitive ligand-binding neutralising antibody assay. According to the method, test samples (and 
controls) are incubated with a ruthenium-labelled mepolizumab. After incubation, samples are mixed 
with biotinylated recombinant human IL-5. Subsequently, streptavidin coated magnetic beads are 
added to the wells of the plate. The plate was read on a Bioveris M384 analyser and ECL units were 
measured.  
The method was validated for the following parameters: precision (intra- and inter-), linearity (156 
ng/ml – 10,000 ng/ml), range, sensitivity and drug interference. Two independently prepared PC-
spiked samples (HQC 12.0 µg/ml and LQC 2.4 µg/ml) were titrated and run in an assay on 3 different 
days by 2 analysts. An intra-assay precision of < 20% CV was obtained for PC concentrations ranging 
from 750- 37.5 ng/ml (final assay concentration). An inter-assay precision of <20% CV was obtained 
with PC concentrations ranging from 1500 – 37.5 ng/ml (final assay concentration). The lowest PC 
standard (156 ng/ml final assay concentration) was set as the sensitivity value. At a PC concentration 
of 4 µg/ml, the presence of 2 µg/ml unlabelled drug interfered with the detection of the PC. At a PC 
concentration of 20 µg/ml, no false negatives were generated at any of the tested drug concentrations 
(3.9 - 125 µg/ml). However, drug concentrations greater than 15.6µg/ml generated a false positive 
signal of the negative control. Clinical samples containing drug levels greater than 15.6 mg/ml must be 
diluted prior to testing in the assay.  
During screening cut point determination, 44 sera from normal human donors were analysed on 3 
different days by at least 2 analysts. The distribution of the data was analysed and determined to be 
normal. A parametric cut point of 79.6% was determined using the 95th percentile.  
Clinical study MHE100901 
The validated 3rd generation NAb assay was used. This is the same assay that was used to support the 
clinical studies in the initial severe asthma application and the liquid mepolizumab application.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Mepolizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody (IgG1, kappa), which targets human interleukin-5 
(IL-5) with high affinity and specificity. IL-5 is the major cytokine responsible for the growth and 
differentiation, recruitment, activation and survival of eosinophils. Mepolizumab inhibits the bioactivity 
of IL-5 with nanomolar potency by blocking the binding of IL-5 to the alpha chain of the IL-5 receptor 
Assessment report  
EMA/560938/2021  
Page 25/140 
 
 
 
 
 
complex expressed on the eosinophil cell surface, thereby inhibiting IL-5 signalling and reducing the 
production and survival of eosinophils. 
Primary pharmacology 
Mepolizumab produces a sustained, consistent, dose-dependent reduction in blood eosinophil count, 
irrespective of disease, age, baseline blood eosinophil count, or administration route, with maximum 
eosinopenia of approximately 90% due to IL-3 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor 
(GM-CSF) redundancy. The blood eosinophil dose-response is well-characterised, validated by 
independent data, and supported the rationale for dose selection in pivotal Phase III studies across 
various eosinophilic conditions, including Study 200622. 
Study 200622: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to investigate the efficacy and 
safety of mepolizumab in the treatment of adolescent and adult subjects with severe hypereosinophilic 
syndrome 
At baseline, geometric mean blood eosinophil levels were similar in the mepolizumab (1460 cells/μL) 
and placebo (1350 cells/μL) treatment groups. At the first post-dose assessment (Week 2), the 
geometric mean in the mepolizumab group showed a marked decline from baseline to 170 cells/μL 
compared with a slight initial decline in the placebo group (1260 cells/μL). The reduction in blood 
eosinophils observed at Week 8 in the mepolizumab group was maintained overall through Week 3 
(see below): 
Figure 7: Ratio Compared to Baseline in Blood Eosinophil Count (Study 200622, While on 
Treatment Estimand, PD Population) 
At Week 32, subjects treated with mepolizumab had a 92% reduction in blood eosinophils compared 
with subjects receiving placebo (see below), with a geometric mean absolute count of 70 cells/μL. At 
the end of the 32-week Treatment Period, blood eosinophil levels remained slightly decreased from 
baseline in the placebo group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/560938/2021  
Page 26/140 
 
 
 
 
Total Serum Interleukin-5 (IL-5) 
At baseline, geometric mean total serum IL-5 levels were similar in the mepolizumab (5.51 ng/L) and 
placebo (7.72 ng/L) treatment groups. At Week 32, the geometric mean in the mepolizumab group 
showed a marked increase to 166.07 ng/L and total serum IL-5 showed little change from baseline in 
the placebo group (6.38 ng/L). The increase in the mepolizumab group was anticipated considering the 
assay was measuring both free IL-5 and IL-5 bound to mepolizumab. 
Results of the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test (median total IL-5) demonstrated a statistically significant 
difference between the mepolizumab and placebo treatment groups in the ratio to baseline of serum 
total IL-5 at Week 32 (median ratio 29.71). 
Secondary pharmacology 
Mepolizumab does not bind to the hERG channel and QT-mediated pro-arrhythmia due to blockade is 
not a concern with mAbs due to their very high molecular weight. In clinical studies there were no 
adverse effects on cardiac conduction or repolarisation at doses in excess of the proposed marketed 
dose in the various indications. Furthermore, a concentration-response analysis did not show any 
effects of mepolizumab on QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc). A thorough QTc study has not 
therefore been conducted. 
2.3.4.   PK/PD modelling 
A PK/PD analysis was conducted to investigate whether the blood eosinophil response to mepolizumab 
treatment in patients with HES was consistent with the response observed in patients with other 
eosinophilic conditions. 108 patients with HES from the pivotal Phase III study 200622 were included 
in the PKPD dataset. Post-hoc individual predicted mepolizumab concentrations were merged with 
blood eosinophil count data before model fitting. 
Assessment report  
EMA/560938/2021  
Page 27/140 
 
 
 
 
Considering the small sample size of each treatment group in the study (54 subjects/treatment group) 
and the narrow range of values for some covariates, the covariate investigation is overall considered of 
limited value. With the exception of the baseline blood eosinophil count effect, which was already 
included as a covariate in the model, on baseline blood eosinophil count (KRO) and maximum effect 
(Imax), there was no apparent obvious trend in any other covariates. No refinement of the model was 
therefore deemed necessary. 
Goodness of fit for the model, as demonstrated by conventional plots and NPDE, are shown below:

Figure 10: Normalised Prediction Distribution Error 
In order to further evaluate the concordance between the predicted and observed blood eosinophil 
counts in the study, individual blood eosinophil count predictions were generated against which the 
model was validated prospectively using the following more stringent goodness of fit tests: Shapiro-
Wilk, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Cramér–von Mises and Anderson-Darling. The tests were applied to 
placebo and mepolizumab datasets separately. 
Based on the Shapiro-Wilk (location) test for the placebo data and the Kolmogorov- Smirnov (location) 
test for the mepolizumab data, there was no evidence to suggest that the observations and predictions 
were drawn from different distributions at the 5% significance level. 
By contrast, based on the Cramér–von Mises and Anderson-Darling tests (which are tests sensitive to 
distribution tails), Shapiro-Wilk test (mepolizumab data only), and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (placebo 
data only) it was not possible to reject (at the 5% +significance level) the null hypothesis that the 
observations and predictions are drawn from different distributions. Inclusion of imputed data (0.005 
in place of 0), digit bias (values recorded to two decimal places), spikes in observed blood eosinophil 
count, and effects of blinded OCS treatment on eosinophil production during the study, most likely 
contributed to these results.

Figure 13: Model Visual Predictive Check (Semi-log plot) 
In order to reflect the baseline blood eosinophil count of the HES population enrolled into the study 
(much higher than in any other studies conducted with mepolizumab across indications) a factor of 2 
for baseline count was applied (see below).

Statistical tests only consider the statistical significance of the effect, which might, however, be too 
small to be of clinical significance. It is therefore recommended to interpret those results in conjunction 
with for example a Q-Q plot. Based on the totality of evidence, including visual predictive checks and

goodness of fit plots (including Q-Q plot), and in the context of a PD endpoint subject to considerable 
variability, it was concluded that the model was able to appropriately predict blood eosinophil counts in 
an HES population with high baseline blood eosinophil count following SC administration. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
A single pivotal study (Study 200622) was conducted to support the proposed posology of 300 mg SC 
administered every 4 weeks in hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) in which sparse PK sampling was 
taken. Mepolizumab PK data was analysed using the most recent population PK model, which it should 
be noted includes data from a HES IV administration study, Study MHE100185). It is accepted, based 
on the statistical tests employed, that at the 5% significance threshold there was no evidence that 
predicted and observed plasma concentrations were drawn from different distributions.  
However, based on a visual inspection the GOF plots, the meta-analysis model does not appear to fit 
the HES data particularly well, especially at the population level. The VPC also suggests that the meta-
analysis model does not predict the observed concentrations in HES patients particularly well. 
However, it is accepted that the clinical relevance of the apparent variability and poor model is likely to 
be low, and as such this issue has not been pursued further. 
Although age was not considered a clinically relevant covariate in the population PK model, only one 
adolescent subject in study 200622 was dosed with mepolizumab. The single adolescent subject 
included in the mepolizumab arm in study 200622 exhibited exposures in the upper end of the range 
observed in the study and exhibited a marked reduction in eosinophils at week 4. The limited data 
available do not indicate an age-related difference in PK in the HES population. 
Following treatment with 300 mg mepolizumab SC blood eosinophils were markedly reduced, this was 
maintained for the duration of the trial.  
The MAH provided supportive evidence that subcutaneous administration of mepolizumab 300 mg had 
approximately three times the systemic exposure of mepolizumab 100 mg. This is added in section 5.2 
of the SmPC. 
The most recent meta-analysis PKPD mode) was applied to the PK/PD data collected from patients with 
HES in study 200622, without adjustment. No new relevant covariates were identified. The GOF plots 
indicated that the PKPD model did not fit the HES data particularly well. This was confirmed by several 
statistical goodness of fit tests, which were not able to reject the null at the 5% significance threshold 
that predicted and observed plasma concentrations were from different distributions. This suggests 
that the PD response to mepolizumab in subjects with HES may not be similar to other eosinophilic 
conditions. The VPCs also suggested that the meta-analysis model, without adjustment, does not 
predict well the reduction in eosinophil count with mepolizumab treatment in patients with HES but the 
data appear to fit better when an adjustment factor based on the higher blood eosinophil count of the 
HES population is applied.  
The MAH argues the totality of the data, when taking into consideration the high variability of the PD 
endpoint is sufficient to conclude that the model could adequately predict blood eosinophil levels. They 
have submitted acceptable justification for the correction factor of 2 which was applied to baseline 
eosinophil counts which did improve the model fit. Additional data on additional goodness of fit 
statistical tests does not alter the previous assessment. It is accepted that as the model is not being 
used for extrapolation in this indication, that efficacy has been assessed in the target population and 
that the model fit is unlikely to have clinical implications. This issue can thus be considered resolved.

2.3.1.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology has been sufficiently characterised in the proposed indication. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The original marketing authorization procedure for the treatment of patients with HES 
(EMEA/H/C/001069/00) was submitted in September 2008. This application was withdrawn in July 
2009 as it was considered that the submitted data was insufficient to grant the marketing 
authorization. Although studies MHE100185 and MHE100901 were assessed during the original 
procedure (EMEA/H/C/001069/00), for completeness the results of this assessment is presented in the 
supportive studies section of this assessment report 
The MAH submitted a single pivotal placebo-controlled Phase III study, 200622 in support of this 
marketing authorization application. This study is supplemented with efficacy data from the OLE study 
205203. Studies MHE100185 and MHE100901 were also provided by the MAH however, due to 
differences in patient population, endpoints, eosinophil blinding, and mepolizumab doses the role of 
these studies in support of this application is limited.  
2.4.2.  Dose response study(ies) 
A dose of mepolizumab 300 mg administered SC every 4 weeks was selected for investigation in this 
study. The dose selected was lower than the 750 mg intravenous (IV) dose administered every 4 
weeks previously investigated in a HES study (MHE100185). The dose selection was guided by 
information observed during the uncontrolled phase of an open-label extension HES study MHE100901 
during which dosing interval was tailored (4 to 12 weeks) according to individual patient disease and 
response, including blood eosinophil count assessment. 
In support of the dose selection, a dose-response meta-analysis for blood eosinophil reduction (a proxy 
marker of pharmacology), including data from 16 studies and various eosinophilic conditions, albeit 
dominated by asthma, was carried out. Results highlighted differences between severe asthma and 
HES populations and confirmed the effects of OCS on blood eosinophil suppression in both diseases. 
Dose- response models confirmed that baseline blood eosinophil count is an important determinant of 
overall response, with both location and maximum achievable drug inhibition being baseline-
dependent. Inversion of the dose response showed that to achieve clinically meaningful target absolute 
blood eosinophil counts in patients with HES, doses higher than the therapeutic severe asthma dose of 
100 mg SC were required. Although HES experts recognized that there is no universal blood eosinophil 
level or degree of suppression cut-off at which clinical benefit would be expected in all HES patients, 
considering that the current therapeutic option aims to maintain blood eosinophils as low as possible, it 
was not unreasonable to target a level within a normal range, i.e., <500 cells/μL and ideally between 
200-300 cells/μL in the majority of HES patients. Acknowledging the limitations of extrapolation 
outside the range of data included in the dose-response model (to adjust for the effects of concomitant 
OCS treatment), it was predicted that patients with a baseline blood eosinophil count between 1000 
(minimal level required at baseline in the proposed study) and 8000 cells/μL would achieve a blood 
eosinophil count between 100-500 cells/μL following a SC dose of mepolizumab 300 mg every 4 weeks

2.4.3.  Main study 
Title of Study : Study 200622 
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to investigate the efficacy and safety 
of mepolizumab in the treatment of adolescent and adult subjects with severe 
hypereosinophilic syndrome.  
Methods 
This was a 32-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multi- centre study. 
Subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive either placebo or mepolizumab 300 mg subcutaneous (SC) 
every 4 weeks in addition to their maintenance HES treatment.   
This study consisted of 3 periods: 
•  Screening: approximately 4 weeks 
•  Double-blind Treatment Period: 32 weeks 
• 
Follow-up: 8 weeks (subjects that enrolled into the open label extension did not require a 
follow-up visit). 
Subjects that completed the 32-week treatment period were eligible to screen for a 20- week open 
label extension (study 205203) where all subjects received mepolizumab 300 mg SC every 4 weeks.

Study participants 
Inclusion criteria  
•  Male or female subjects ≥12 years of age diagnosed with HES for at least 6 months at 
randomization (Visit 2). HES diagnosis was based on signs or symptoms of organ system 
involvement and/or dysfunction that could be directly related to: 
o  blood eosinophilia of >1500 eosinophils/μL on at least 2 occasions, and/or 
Assessment report

o 
tissue eosinophilia documented prior to Visit 2 without a discernible secondary cause (e.g., 
drug hypersensitivity, parasitic helminth infection, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] 
infection, non-hematologic malignancy. 
Tissue eosinophilia was defined as a history of one or more of the following: 
o  The percentage of eosinophils exceeded 20% of all nucleated cells in bone marrow sections. 
o 
In the opinion of a pathologist, tissue infiltration by eosinophils was extensive (massive) when 
compared with the normal physiologic range, compared with other inflammatory cells, or both.

protein) revealed extensive extracellular deposition of eosinophil-derived proteins indicative of 
local eosinophil activation 
•  A history of 2 or more HES flares within the past 12 months prior to Screening (Visit 1). Historical 
HES flares were defined as documented HES-related worsening of clinical symptoms or blood 
eosinophil counts requiring an escalation in therapy. At least one HES flare within the past 12 months 
must not have been related to a decrease in HES therapy during the 4 weeks prior to the flare.

or cirrhosis. 
NOTE: Chronic stable hepatitis B and C (e.g., presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or positive 
hepatitis C antibody test result at screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment) are 
acceptable if subject otherwise meets entry criteria. 
Treatments 
In the study patients received either placebo or mepolizumab 300 mg subcutaneous (SC) every 4 weeks 
in addition to their maintenance HES treatment.   
Table 7: Mepolizumab Study Treatment

Placebo 
The placebo in this study was 0.9% sodium chloride (saline) solution and was provided by the 
investigational site. Three SC injections were administered every 4 weeks into the abdomen, upper 
arm, or thigh in accordance with the randomization schedule. 
Blinded OCS 
GSK  provided  blinded  OCS  for  this  study.  Each  bottle  had  a  unique  identifier  number  and  contained 
either 5 mg OCS (prednisolone capsules) or matching placebo capsules.  
Prior and Concomitant Medications and Non-Drug Therapies 
Permitted Medications and Non-Drug Therapies 
Standard HES Therapy 
Use of standard HES therapy including OCS, immunosuppressive or cytotoxic therapy (e.g., 
hydroxyurea, IFNα, cyclosporine, imatinib, methotrexate, azathioprine) was permitted during the 
study. Subjects must have been on a stable dose of HES therapy for the 4 weeks prior to 
randomization (Visit 2). The same regimen of HES therapy must have been maintained throughout the 
32-week Treatment Period unless there was worsening of symptom(s) that required an increase in 
therapy. If a subject had worsening 
of symptom(s) and required an increase in therapy after randomization, the subject was considered to 
be experiencing a flare. Once the subject regained disease control, the investigator was encouraged, 
as medically appropriate, to adjust the dose of HES therapy back to the level prior to the disease 
worsening. 
A reduction in standard HES therapy dose for safety reasons, with return to the original dosing 
regimen when possible, was permitted in consultation with the GSK Medical Monitor. 
Non-HES Related Medical Conditions 
Additional therapies required to treat non-HES related medical conditions during the study were 
permitted in consultation with the GSK Medical Monitor and must have been prospectively captured in 
the eCRF. 
Prohibited Medications and Non-Drug Therapies 
Initiation of new medications or herbal remedies which may alter the course of HES or interact with the 
study treatment was prohibited within their specified timeframe and throughout the study (Visit 0 to 
Visit 11 inclusive) with the exception of HES therapy to treat a HES flare. 
In addition, the following medications were prohibited: 
• 
• 
any  investigational  agents  (biologic  or  non-biologic)  within  the  30  days  or  5  drug  half-lives 
whichever was longer, prior to Screening (Visit 1), and until Visit 11 
any other biologic agents (except for IFNα): within 30 days or 5 half-lives, whichever was longer, 
of Screening (Visit 1), and until Visit 11.

Definitions 
HES flare 
In this study, disease flare (HES flare) was defined as (1) a HES-related clinical manifestation based on 
a physician-documented change in clinical signs or symptoms resulting in the need for therapy 
adjustment (increase in OCS dose of at least 10 mg/day or any increase in or addition of any 
cytotoxic/immunosuppressive HES therapy) or (2) receipt of 2 or more courses of blinded active OCS 
during the treatment period. 
An increase in blood eosinophils above the pre-defined threshold level (2 x baseline value or baseline 
value + 2500 cells/µL) without any other clinical manifestations during the study led to administration 
of blinded active OCS treatment. If a subject received a 2nd course of blinded active OCS during the 
Assessment report  
EMA/560938/2021  
Page 38/140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
32-week Treatment Period, the subject was considered to be experiencing a flare. The container list for 
the blinded OCS treatment (indicating which container numbers contained active OCS and which 
contained placebo OCS) was used to define HES flares meeting endpoint definition b). Subsequently, 
the date of the first blood draw at which blood eosinophil count was below the threshold to trigger 
blinded active OCS was considered the resolution date. Each subsequent course of blinded active OCS 
beyond 14 days from the resolution date of the preceding flare was considered as an additional flare 
(e.g., 3 courses of blinded active OCS were considered as 2 flares, 4 courses of blinded active OCS are 
considered as 3 flares, etc.). 
HES Core Assessments to Monitor Disease Activities and Identify HES Flares during the Study:  
The clinical presentation of HES covers a wide variety of end-organ manifestations. In an effort to 
assess the clinical manifestations in the most commonly affected organ systems in patients with HES, 
the HES Core Assessments was utilized by the investigators to characterize the disease at Baseline and 
also to monitor the changes during the treatment period. This core assessment is the product of 
collective input from a panel of experts in the field and provided the consistent framework for the 
investigators to assess a HES flare. The HES Core Assessments tool was used to record the subject’s 
clinical manifestations, but ultimately investigators used their clinical judgment to determine if a 
subject was experiencing a HES flare. 
Table 8: HES Core Assessments 
Assessment report  
EMA/560938/2021  
Page 39/140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) 
The BFI is a tool developed for the rapid assessment of fatigue severity for use in both clinical 
screening and clinical trials. The BFI has 9 items. The subject rated their average and worst fatigue 
levels over the previous 24 hours using a numeri rating scale anchored with 0 (no fatigue/interference) 
and 10 (as bad as you can imagine/completely interferes) numeric rating scales. The subject 
completed one item of the BFI daily and the full BFI every 7 days at home on the eDiary. 
HES Daily Symptoms (HES-DS) 
The HES-DS includes 6 constitutional and organ system-specific symptoms commonly reported by 
patients with HES. Each item has a 11-point numeric rating scale with 0 indicating that the symptom 
was not present and 10 indicating symptom was worst imaginable. At the Randomization Visit (Visit 2), 
the subject identified up to 3 symptoms that were most bothersome and the results were recorded in 
the eCRF. At home, each of the 6 symptoms were rated daily on the eDiary; the symptoms were rated 
by the subject each evening recalling the worst symptom experience over the previous 24 hours. 
Sample size 
An initial sample size of 80 subjects was estimated dependent on a pre-planned blinded sample size 
re-estimation.  The pre-planned blinded sample size re-estimation was planned to be performed after 
at least 60 subjects had been randomized, to assess the overall proportion of subjects that had a HES 
flare during the 32-week Treatment Period. If, based on the pre-planned blinded analysis, the overall 
flare rate was predicted to be <30%, the sample size could be increased up to a maximum of 120 
subjects in total. When 60 subjects had been randomized, the estimated blinded overall proportion 
who would have a flare by the end of the 32-week Treatment Period was between 25 and 27.5% and 
therefore the decision was made to increase the sample size to 50 subjects per am (100 in total). 
Randomisation 
The randomization was stratified by region due to potential differences in SoC between regions. 
Assessment report  
EMA/560938/2021

An unblinded site staff member was assigned to the study to prepare the appropriate study medication 
according to the subject’s treatment assignment. Subjects eligible to enter the study were assigned to 
treatment randomly through an interactive response technology (IRT), the Registration and Medication 
Ordering System Next Generation (RAMOS NG). 
Blinding (masking) 
The effect of mepolizumab on blood eosinophil counts is rapid, readily observable, and may lead to 
inadvertent unblinding of the treatment assignment. Therefore, in this study, investigators, 
participating subjects, and MAH study personnel were blinded to absolute blood eosinophil counts, total 
white blood cell counts, and white blood count differentials (%) from randomization (Visit 2) to the end 
of the study. Since initiating treatment based on an increase in eosinophil levels alone (without clinical 
symptoms) is part of SoC for HES patients, blood eosinophil-unblinded MAH personnel/delegates not 
involved with other aspects of study conduct monitored the absolute eosinophil count results and 
triggered blinded OCS treatment to treat an eosinophilia flare. This was to ensure that subjects were 
not be placed at undue risk during the study, while maintaining the treatment blind. 
Treatment Blinding 
Mepolizumab and placebo were identical in appearance (blinded syringes) and were administered by a 
blinded member of the site staff. The blinded site staff administered 3 blinded syringes SC, each 
containing 100 mg/1 ml of investigational product (mepolizumab or placebo).  
Treatment codes could be unblinded by the investigator or treating physician only in the case of a 
medical emergency or in the event of a serious medical condition, when knowledge of the 
investigational product was essential for the clinical management or welfare of the subject. The MAH 
Global Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance (GCSP) staff could unblind treatment codes in the event 
of an SAE. 
Blood Eosinophil Blinding 
Investigators, MAH personnel involved in the study, and subjects were blinded to the results of 
absolute blood eosinophil counts, total white blood cell counts, and white blood count differentials (%). 
Subjects that had an increase in blood eosinophils above the pre-determined threshold (2 x Baseline 
value [randomization] or Baseline value + 2500 cells/ μL) were instructed to take OCS capsules. In 
order to maintain the blind, this treatment was with blinded OCS capsules. 
All subjects were provided 2 bottles of blinded OCS capsules, one containing 5 mg OCS capsules 
(active OCS treatment) and a second one containing matching placebo capsules (placebo OCS 
treatment). These were dispensed to each subject at each scheduled clinic visit and as needed. 
Blood eosinophil-unblinded MAH personnel/delegates not involved with other aspects of study conduct 
reviewed the results from the central laboratory for absolute blood eosinophil count. If the pre-
specified threshold blood eosinophil level (i.e., 2 x Baseline value [randomization] or Baseline value + 
2500 cells/ μL) was reached (eosinophilia flare), blood eosinophil-unblinded MAH personnel/delegates 
communicated with the investigator to initiate blinded OCS treatment from one of the bottles provided 
(active treatment) unless the subject’s HES therapy (OCS, cytotoxic agent, or immunosuppressive 
agent) had already been increased due to a symptom flare within the past 2 weeks.  
Assessment report  
EMA/560938/2021  
Page 41/140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The subject administered the blinded OCS from the assigned bottle for approximately 2 weeks. A 
subject who did not reach the pre-specified blood eosinophil threshold with a similar blood draw date 
was selected to initiate a placebo treatment in a blinded manner, to maintain study blood eosinophil 
blinding. 
Approximately 2 weeks after the scheduled clinic visit, the blood eosinophil count was assessed again 
for the subject who started blinded OCS (both active and placebo). The subject who was administered 
active blinded OCS was instructed to either continue with a new course of blinded OCS regimen from 
Day 1 (i.e., 40mg) until the next scheduled clinic visit if the blood eosinophil count was at or above the 
threshold (unless the subject’s HES therapy [OCS, cytotoxic agent, or immunosuppressive agent] had 
been increased due to a symptom flare since the initiation of the current course of blinded OCS), or to 
discontinue blinded OCS if the blood eosinophil count was below the threshold.  
For subjects taking placebo-blinded OCS, continuation/discontinuation of blinded OCS was determined 
depending on the continuation/discontinuation of their matched subject on active-blinded OCS. 
From 11 January 2018 onwards, the process described above for continuation with new course or 
discontinuation of treatment was modified. When a subject’s blood eosinophil count was assessed 
again after approximately 2 weeks and was still above/at the threshold, the investigational site was 
not instructed to initiate a new course but instead instructed to retain the subject on a dose of 5 mg.

Analysis Populations 
Primary endpoint 
The proportion of subjects who experienced a HES flare during the 32-week Treatment Period was 
analysed using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by the covariates of region and baseline OCS 
dose (0-≤20 mg/day and >20 mg/day prednisolone/prednisone or equivalent). 
The analysis was supplemented with a logistic regression analysis adjusting for covariates of region, 
baseline OCS dose, and treatment.  The model was used to estimate the odds ratio for the treatment 
difference and associated p-value and 95% confidence interval (CI). 
Secondary endpoints 
Time to first HES flare was analysed using a log-rank test stratified by the covariates of region and 
baseline OCS dose.  This analysis was supplemented by a Cox proportional hazards regression model 
allowing for the covariates of region and baseline OCS dose. The hazard ratio was derived along with 
95% confidence limits.  Cumulative event rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. 
The proportion of subjects who experienced a HES flare during Week 20 through Week 32 was 
analysed in the same way as the primary endpoint, using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by 
covariates of region and baseline OCS dose. 
The rate of HES flares was calculated for each subject as the number of observed HES flares divided by 
the time (expressed in years) between the first dose of study treatment and Week 32 
The number of observed HES flares was calculated for each subject as the number of unique starting 
dates for HES flares.  To be considered as a separate episode of HES flare, the onset date of a HES 
flare must be at least 14 days apart from the resolution date of the preceding HES flare. The rate of 
HES flares was compared between the treatment groups using a stratified Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, 
stratified by covariates of region and baseline OCS dose. 
The change from baseline in fatigue severity at Week 32 was calculated using the mean of the 7 daily 
assessments up to and including the date of the Week 32 visit as the Week 32 assessment, and the 
mean of the 7 daily assessments up to but not including the date of first dose of study treatment as 
the baseline assessment. The change from baseline in fatigue severity at Week 32 was compared 
between the treatment groups using a stratified Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, stratified by baseline fatigue 
severity, baseline OCS dose, and region. 
Estimands  
The primary estimand strategy was defined to be a ‘treatment policy’ approach with intercurrent 
events considered to a) discontinuation of study medication and b) receipt of alternative HES 
medications. 
The study was designed to continue to collect data on HES flares for subjects who prematurely 
discontinue from their randomised study treatment. All data on HES flares collected for these subjects 
were to be included in the primary analysis. Subjects who withdrew from the study prior to Week 32 
(Visit 11) and therefore had missing data on HES flares were included in the primary analysis as 
treatment failures, i.e. for the primary comparison, a subject was classed as not experiencing a HES 
flare only if they had no flares reported and completed Week 32 (Visit 11). 
Sensitivity analyses was performed on the ITT population to examine the potential impact of the 
missing data:

•  Subjects withdrawing from the study prematurely prior to reporting a HES flare, with the 
primary reason for treatment withdrawal reported as AE or Lack of Efficacy, was classed as 
experiencing a HES flare in the analysis. Subjects withdrawing from the study prematurely with 
any other reason for treatment withdrawal will be included as having a flare if one is recorded 
prior to study withdrawal, and as not having a flare if no flare is recorded prior to study 
withdrawal. 
•  Subjects withdrawing from the study prematurely will be included as having a flare if one is 
recorded prior to study withdrawal, and as not having a flare if no flare is recorded prior to 
study withdrawal. 
A supplementary estimand using the ‘while on treatment ’strategy was also defined for the intercurrent 
event of discontinuation of study medication. Subjects discontinuing from study treatment prematurely 
will be included as having a HES flare if a flare is recorded with an onset date equal or prior to 28 days 
after the last dose of study treatment, and not having a flare otherwise. 
Statistical Analysis of the Primary endpoint 
The ITT population was the primary population for all efficacy analyses. 
For all efficacy analyses, the primary treatment effect to be estimated (estimand) was the treatment 
policy effect’ of initial randomized treatment. A treatment policy strategy was used for the intercurrent 
events of a) discontinuation of study medication and b) receipt of alternative HES medications. The 
study was designed to continue to collect data on HES flares for subjects who prematurely 
discontinued from their randomized treatment. All data on HES flares collected for these subjects were 
included in analysis of the primary estimand. 
Primary Estimand: The proportion of subjects who experience a HES flare during the 32-week 
Treatment Period was analyzed using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by the covariates of 
region and baseline OCS dose (0-≤20mg/day and >20mg/day prednisolone/prednisone or equivalent). 
The analysis was supplemented with a logistic regression analysis adjusting for covariates of region, 
baseline OCS dose, and treatment. The model was used to estimate the odds ratio for the treatment 
difference and associated p-value and 95% confidence interval (CI). For subjects who withdrew 
prematurely from study treatment and for whom collection of data on HES flares was not possible, it 
was assumed for the primary endpoint that they were treatment failures, i.e., that they experienced a 
flare following study withdrawal. 
Sensitivity analyses of the primary estimand were performed to examine the potential impact of the 
missing data. 
The primary analysis was repeated using the Per Protocol population. 
Supplementary Estimand: A supplementary estimand using the ‘while on treatment’ strategy was 
assessed for the intercurrent event of discontinuation of study medication. Subjects discontinuing from 
study treatment prematurely were included as having a HES flare if a flare was recorded with an onset 
date equal or prior to 28 days after the last dose of study treatment, and not having a flare otherwise.  
Statistical Analyses of key secondary endpoint 
Time to first HES flare: Time to first HES flare was analyzed using a log-rank test stratified by the 
covariates of region and baseline OCS dose. This analysis was supplemented by a Cox proportional 
Assessment report

Page 44/140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hazards regression model allowing for the covariates of region and baseline OCS dose. The hazard 
ratio was derived along with 95% confidence limits. Cumulative event rates were calculated using the 
Kaplan-Meier method. If a subject withdrew prematurely from the study prior to experiencing a HES 
flare, the event time was censored at the time point at which the subject withdrew from the study. 
Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the potential impact of the missing data. 
Proportion of Subjects Who Experience a HES Flare during Week 20 through Week 32 
The proportion of subjects who experienced a HES flare during Week 20 through Week 32 was 
analyzed in the same way as the primary endpoint, using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by 
covariates of region and baseline OCS dose. The analysis was supplemented with a logistic regression 
analysis adjusting for covariates of region, baseline OCS dose, and treatment. 
Subjects who withdrew prematurely from the study prior to Week 32 (Visit 11) and therefore have 
missing data on HES flares during Week 20 through Week 32 were included in the analysis as 
treatment failures i.e., that they experience a flare during Week 20 through Week 32. Sensitivity 
analyses were performed to examine the potential impact of the missing data. 
Rate of HES Flares: The rate of HES flares was calculated for each subject as the number of observed 
HES flares divided by the time (expressed in years) between the first dose of study treatment and 
either the Week 32 visit date if available, or otherwise the study withdrawal date. 
The number of observed HES flares was calculated for each subject as the number of unique starting 
dates for HES flares. To be considered as a separate episode of HES flare, the onset date of a HES flare 
must be at least 14 days apart from the resolution date of the preceding HES flare. 
The rate of HES flares was compared between the treatment groups using a stratified Wilcoxon Rank 
Sum test, stratified by covariates of region and baseline OCS dose. This analysis was supplemented by 
an analysis using a negative binomial generalized linear model with a log link-function and included 
terms for treatment group, region, baseline OCS dose, and included the log of the observed time as an 
offset variable.  
For subjects withdrawing prematurely from the study during the 32-week Treatment Period, all data up 
to the time of study withdrawal was used to calculate the rate of HES flares. A sensitivity analyses 
using a negative binomial generalized linear model was performed, in which missing data for subjects 
withdrawing from the study prematurely was imputed for the period between withdrawal from the 
study and Week 32. For subjects in the mepolizumab treatment group, the missing time period was 
imputed assuming that the subject’s expected flare rate is shifted to that of the placebo arm (Jump to 
Reference [J2R]). For subjects in the placebo group, missing data was assumed to the missing at 
random (MAR). 
Change from Baseline in Fatigue Severity BFI Item 3 (Worst Level of Fatigue in Past 
24 Hours) at Week 32.  
The change from baseline in fatigue severity at Week 32 was compared between the treatment groups 
using a stratified Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, stratified by baseline fatigue severity. 
Subjects with missing change from baseline BFI item 3 at Week 32 were included in the 
analysis with the largest (i.e. worst) value observed for any subject. A supportive repeated measures 
analysis including assessments at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, and 32, in which missing data was 
assumed to be MAR and was not imputed with the largest (i.e. worst) value was also performed.

Multiplicity  
In order to provide strong control of type I error when making inferences for the pre-defined 
secondary endpoints, multiplicity was controlled using a hierarchical, closed testing procedure. The 
hierarchy of endpoints was defined as follows: 
1. proportion of subjects who experienced a HES flare during the 32-week Treatment Period (primary 
endpoint) 
2. time to first HES flare 
3. proportion of subjects who experienced a HES flare during Week 20 through Week 32 
4. rate of HES flares 
5. change from baseline in fatigue severity based on BFI item 3 (worst level of fatigue during past 24 
hours) at Week 32 
When strong control of type I error was implemented, each endpoint in the hierarchy was formally 
tested for confirmatory evidence of statistical significance only if all preceding tests were statistically 
significant.  
Results 
Participant flow 
In total, 108 subjects were randomized and received at least one dose of study treatment (54 to 
placebo and 54 to mepolizumab).  The study population included 4 adolescent (12-17 years) subjects.  
Of the 4 adolescents, 1 was randomized to mepolizumab and 3 were randomized to placebo.

The majority of subjects in the ITT Population completed the study (104, 96%) and 102 subjects 
continued treatment in the OLE study 205203 (94%). Of the 6 (6%) subjects who prematurely 
discontinued study treatment, 4 subjects also withdrew from the study and 2 continued participation in

the study until Week 32 and Follow-up. The primary reasons for premature discontinuation of study 
treatment or withdrawal from the study were AE and voluntary withdrawal by the subject; one subject 
(in the mepolizumab group) had a fatal AE.

Recruitment 
This was a global study sponsored by GSK; 39 investigational sites randomized subjects to study 
treatment: 15 subjects in the United States of America (USA), 70 in Europe (11 in Belgium, 14 in 
Germany, 18 in France, 5 in Italy, 6 in the United Kingdom (UK), 3 in Spain, 10 in Poland, and 3 in 
Romania), 7 in Argentina, 5 in Mexico, 4 in Brazil, and 7 in Russia. 
This study was initiated on 07 March 2017 (first subject, first visit) and completed on 08 August 2019 
(last subject, last visit). 
Conduct of the study 
Important protocol deviations were cited for 63% and 70% of subjects in the mepolizumab and 
placebo groups, respectively. The most frequent deviation was study procedures, which occurred with 
an incidence of 26% in each treatment group.

PP Population 
Protocol deviations were tracked by the study team throughout the study. The data was reviewed prior 
to source data lock to identify all deviations that could significantly impact the primary endpoint and 
lead to exclusion from the PP population prior to unblinding. Incorrect study treatment deviations were 
identified after source data lock. Based on these reviews, a total of 5 subjects were excluded from the 
PP population due to protocol deviations that could potentially impact the efficacy analyses: 3 (6%) 
subjects in the mepolizumab group did not meet eligibility criteria and 2 (4%) subjects in the placebo 
group received incorrect study treatment. Details are provided below. 
Eligibility Criteria Deviations: 
•  One subject (mepolizumab 300 mg SC) was not on a stable dose of HES therapy for the 4 weeks 
prior to randomization 
•  One subject (mepolizumab 300 mg SC) was not on a stable dose of HES therapy for the 4 weeks 
prior to randomization 
•  One subject (mepolizumab 300 mg SC) did not have a reported history of 2 or more HES flares 
within the past 12 months prior to Screening; a history of 1 flare was reported before Screening  
Wrong Treatment/Administration/Dose: 
•  One subject (placebo) was randomized to placebo, but inadvertently received active treatment 
at Visit 4. 
•  One subject (placebo) was randomized to placebo, but inadvertently received active treatment 
at Visit 6.

One additional subject in the mepolizumab group had an eligibility criteria deviation related to an ECG 
finding  of  QTc  >450  msec  or  >480  msec  with  bundle  branch  block;  however,  this  deviation  was  not 
considered to affect the study analyses and the subject remained in the PP population. 
MAH Investigation at Site 229946 
An investigation at Site 229946 in Mexico was conducted by the MAH following anomalies in pulmonary 
function test (PFT) data generated by this site for another MAH sponsored study with a different 
investigational product. The report concluded that “there was diminished confidence and trust in the 
integrity of the data generated at this site and this loss of trust extended to other aspects of study 
conduct at this site.” Although there were no data findings for this site in study 200622, a sensitivity 
analysis of the primary estimand excluding the 2 randomized subjects from investigational site 229946 
was performed and no impact on the primary analysis was observed. 
Baseline data 
Demographics 
The demographic characteristics of the ITT population were generally similar across the treatment 
groups. Overall, the majority of the subjects were White (93%) and more than half were female 
(53%). The mean age was 46.0 years, and approximately 83% of the subjects were between 19 and 
64 years of age. Four (4%) adolescent subjects (12-17 years of age) participated in this study.

Table 12: Demographics and Baseline Measurements (Study 200622, ITT Population) 
HES History and Disease-Related Symptoms 
HES history was similar between the treatment groups.  The mean HES disease duration was 5.45 years 
and  5.66  years  for  mepolizumab  and  placebo,  respectively.  The  Median  duration  was  higher  in  the 
placebo arm versus Mepolizumab (8.035 vs 5.079 respectively). 
At  Baseline,  the  most  bothersome  HES-related  symptoms  were  varied  across  subjects;  breathing 
symptoms were the most common symptoms and were reported by 56% of subjects in both treatment 
groups

Medical Conditions 
Sixty four percent of subjects reported past medical conditions other than HES-related conditions. Past 
conditions with the highest incidence included pneumonia (23%), bone fractures (19%), and sinusitis 
(14%). 
In addition to HES, most subjects had other current medical conditions. The most common co-morbid 
conditions were allergic rhinitis or hay fever (25%), hypertension (22%), and gastroesophageal reflux 
(21%). 
Baseline HES Treatment 
At baseline, almost all subjects (92%) had received regular maintenance medications for HES.   
The most frequently reported HES therapy at baseline was OCS (72%) and the incidence of use was 
similar between the treatment groups.  The majority of subjects in both treatment groups were taking 
≤20 mg prednisone or equivalent daily with a median dose of 5.6 mg/day and maximum dose of  
50 mg/day.  More subjects in the mepolizumab group (26%) were receiving 
cytotoxic/immunosuppressive therapy at baseline compared with the placebo group (17%). 
Overall, 23% of subjects were not taking chronic OCS or cytotoxic/immunosuppressive therapy at 
baseline.  All subjects had been treated with either OCS or cytotoxic/immunosuppressive therapy for 
historic flares prior to study entry.

Outcomes and estimation 
Overview of HES Flares 
In this study, disease flare (HES flare) was defined as (1) a HES-related clinical manifestation based on 
a physician-documented change in clinical signs or symptoms resulting in the need for therapy 
adjustment (increase in OCS dose of at least 10 mg/day or any increase in or addition of any 
cytotoxic/immunosuppressive HES therapy) or (2) receipt of 2 or more courses of blinded active OCS 
during the treatment period. 
In total, there were 48 flares in 28 (52%) subjects in the placebo group compared to 17 flares in 14 
(26%) subjects randomized to mepolizumab. Of the 65 flares, 50 (77%) met HES flare definition a and 
19 (29%) met HES flare definition b; 13 flares in the placebo group and 2 flares in the mepolizumab 
group met only HES flare definition b.

Primary Analysis 
The primary analysis compared subjects who experienced a HES flare or withdrew from the study in 
the mepolizumab and placebo treatment groups. Over the 32-week Treatment Period, 50% fewer 
subjects experienced a HES flare or withdrew from the study when treated with mepolizumab 
compared with placebo (p=0.002).  
A parametric logistic regression analysis that adjusted for the covariates of region and baseline OCS 
dose was consistent with the primary analysis, demonstrating a statistically significant odds ratio in 
favor of mepolizumab (p=0.003).

Sensitivity Analysis of the Primary Estimand 
Two sensitivity analyses of the primary estimand were performed to examine the impact of missing 
data (subjects withdrawing from the study prior to Week 32). The results were consistent with the 
primary estimand.  Results of the supplementary ‘while on treatment’ estimand and the analysis of the 
PP population were also consistent with the primary estimand.

Time to First HES Flare 
Over the 32-week Treatment Period, a statistically significant increase in the time to first HES flare was 
observed for subjects treated with mepolizumab compared with placebo (p=0.002). The risk of first 
HES flare over the treatment period was 66% lower for subjects treated with mepolizumab compared 
with placebo (hazard ratio: 0.34; 95% CI 0.18, 0.67).

(Secondary Endpoint) 
From Week 20 through Week 32, fewer subjects experienced a HES flare or withdrew from the study 
when treated with mepolizumab compared with placebo (17% vs. 35% respectively, p=0.020). 
A parametric logistic regression analysis that adjusted for the covariates of region and baseline OCS 
dose was consistent with the primary analysis, demonstrating a statistically significant odds ratio in 
favor of mepolizumab (p=0.022).

Rate of HES Flares (Secondary Endpoint) 
Overall, subjects in the mepolizumab group experienced fewer HES flares during the 32-week 
Treatment Period compared with the placebo group. 
Treatment with mepolizumab resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the annualized rate of 
HES flares (calculated for each subject as number of HES flares divided by time in the study) compared 
with placebo (unadjusted p=0.002; adjusted p=0.020).

Analysis by Baseline Blood Eosinophils – Rate of Flares 
The rate of HES flares was lower in the mepolizumab group compared with placebo for each category 
of baseline blood eosinophils. An exploratory analysis including baseline blood eosinophil count as a 
continuous variable did not show any evidence that the rate ratio differed by baseline blood eosinophil 
count (treatment-by baseline blood eosinophil count interaction p=0.897).

Change from Baseline in Fatigue Severity BFI Item 3 (Worst Level of Fatigue during the Past 
24 hours) at Week 32 (Secondary Endpoint) 
BFI item 3 asks subjects to record their fatigue severity by having them rate their worst Level of 
fatigue during the past 24 hours. Subjects recorded a score every day. Fatigue severity scores for each 
subject at each timepoint were calculated as a mean of up to 7 available daily scores prior to the visit. 
At Baseline, mean BFI item 3 scores were similar between the treatment groups (4.74 for 
mepolizumab and 4.39 for placebo). At Week 32, a larger reduction in the mean change from baseline 
BFI item 3 score was observed in the mepolizumab group (-1.12) compared with the placebo group (-
0.30). 
The primary analysis compared the change from baseline in BFI item 3 score at Week 32 in the 
mepolizumab and placebo treatment groups. Seven subjects in the placebo group and 4 subjects in the 
Assessment report

mepolizumab group had missing data for the change from baseline at Week 32; these subjects were 
included in the analysis with the largest (i.e. worst) change from baseline value observed for any 
subject. 
Results of the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in fatigue 
severity BFI item 3 at Week 32 for subjects treated with mepolizumab compared with placebo 
(unadjusted p=0.036; adjusted p=0.036).  
Exploratory endpoints 
Proportion  of  Subjects  who  have  an  Elevated  Blood  Eosinophil  Level  that  Meets  the  Pre-
Defined Threshold during the 32-Week Study Treatment Period 
A significantly lower proportion of subjects treated with mepolizumab (9%) had an elevated blood 
eosinophil count that met the pre-defined threshold level (2 x Baseline value or Baseline value + 2500 
cells/uL) or withdrew from the study during the 32-week Treatment Period compared with those 
subjects treated with placebo (35%) (p<0.001). 
Spirometry 
At Baseline, mean baseline pre-bronchodilator FEV1 (269.8 mL and 272.9 mL) and FVC (374.1 mL and 
372.6 mL) were similar between the mepolizumab and placebo groups, respectively 
At Week 32, subjects treated with mepolizumab had numerical improvement from Baseline in FEV1 
and FVC compared with placebo  pre-bronchodilator FEV1 and FVC at Week 32 increased by 116 mL 
(95% CI: -3.5, 26.8; p=0.131) and 58 mL (95% CI: -12.1, 23.7; p=0.521) over placebo. Neither of 
these changes were statistically significant. 
The FEV1/FVC ratio was also similar between the treatment groups at Baseline (0.714 and 0.727 for 
mepolizumab and placebo, respectively), and there was numerical improvement with mepolizumab 
from Week 8 and continuing to Week 32. 
Echocardiogram 
At Screening, mean left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEFs) were similar between the treatment 
groups (61.6 % for the mepolizumab group and 62.4% for the placebo group). LVEFs remained stable 
at the end of the treatment period; no changes were observed at Week 32 compared with Screening in 
either treatment group (61.9% for mepolizumab and 62.6% for placebo). 
No trends supportive of deterioration or improvement in association with either mepolizumab or 
placebo treatment were apparent. No subjects had abnormal, clinically significant scan results at Week 
32. 
Most Bothersome HES Symptom Severity Score 
At Baseline, the mean and median most bothersome HES-DS scores were similar between the 
mepolizumab group (4.61 and 4.18, respectively) and placebo group (4.26 and 4.37, respectively). At 
Week 32, a larger reduction in the observed mean change from baseline in the most bothersome HES-
DS score was seen with the mepolizumab group (-1.80) compared with placebo group (-0.88). There 
was a statistically significant reduction (improvement) in the most bothersome symptom score at 
Week 32 for subjects treated with mepolizumab compared with placebo.

HES Symptom Severity Score by Symptom 
At Week 32, a larger reduction in the observed mean change from baseline HESDS score was seen for 
each of the 6 symptoms. 
Non-Parametric Analysis 
Hypothesis tests using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test ranked the 7 subjects in the placebo group and 4 
subjects in the mepolizumab group, with missing change from baseline in HES-DS score at Week 32 as 
having the largest (i.e. worst) change from baseline observed for any subject. These tests compare the 
whole distribution of scores, not the median value. 
Reductions (improvement) in the symptom score at Week 32 for subjects treated with mepolizumab 
compared with placebo were statistically significant at p<0.05 for all symptoms except the worst level 
of chills or sweats where results were suggestive of improvement (p=0.051). 
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup Analyses 
Exploratory analyses of the primary endpoint were also examined by the subgroup factors of age, sex, 
race, geographic region, weight, baseline OCS, and baseline blood eosinophils. 
Generally, in these subgroups, the proportion of subjects who experienced ≥1 HES flare or who 
withdrew from the study during the 32-week Treatment Period was lower in the mepolizumab group 
compared with placebo.

Analysis by Baseline Blood Eosinophils - Primary Endpoint 
The proportion of subjects who experienced ≥1 HES flare or who withdrew from the study during the 
32-week Treatment Period was lower in the mepolizumab group compared with placebo for each 
category of baseline blood eosinophils. 
 An exploratory analysis including baseline blood eosinophil count as a continuous variable did not 
show any evidence that the odds ratio for the proportion of subjects with HES flare during the 32-week 
Treatment Period in the mepolizumab group compared with the placebo group differed by baseline 
blood eosinophil count (treatment by baseline blood eosinophil interaction p=0.762).

Objectives 
Primary Objective 
The primary objective was to describe the long-term safety profile of mepolizumab in subjects with HES 
who took part in Study 200622. 
Exploratory Objectives 
Exploratory objectives were: 
To assess the effect of long-term use of mepolizumab on multiple clinical outcomes. 
To assess the effect of long-term use of mepolizumab on a pharmacodynamics (PD) marker. 
Study design 
This was a multi-center, OLE, 20-week treatment period, safety study of mepolizumab in adolescent and 
adult subjects with HES who took part in the Phase III Study 200622 
Figure 22: Trial design  
Subjects in Study 200622 who met one of the following criteria were screened to continue with 
participation in Study 205203: 
1.  Completion of the 32-week treatment period in Study 200622, or 
2.  If the subject was withdrawn from study treatment prematurely during Study 200622 but 
continued in the study per protocol (including HES flare-related assessments) until 32 weeks 
from randomization. 
Re-screening of subjects was permitted upon approval by the MAH Medical Monitor. 
Eligible subjects received 300 mg SC mepolizumab every 4 weeks for a duration of 20 weeks 
starting approximately 32 weeks after the first dose of study treatment in Study 200622. In this OLE 
Study 205203, the final dose of mepolizumab was administered at Visit 5 (Week 16). Assessments 
during Visit 6 (20 weeks after the first dose and 4 weeks after the last dose) completed the study 
treatment period. Subjects who completed assessments at Visit 6 (Week 20) could continue with 
mepolizumab treatment via mepolizumab HES expanded access (e.g., MHE104317, MHE112562), 
where permitted by local regulations. Subjects in Study 205203 who did not continue with 
Assessment report  
EMA/560938/2021  
Page 64/140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mepolizumab HES expanded access had an additional follow-up assessment at Visit 7 (28 weeks after 
the first dose and 12 weeks after the last dose of mepolizumab). 
During Study 205203, investigators were blinded to the blood eosinophil count for the sample collected 
at Visit 1 (first dosing visit), after which blood eosinophil counts were unblinded starting at Visit 2. 
Investigators were permitted to adjust the subjects’ background HES therapy per SoC starting at Visit 
2 (approximately 4 weeks after the first dose). 
During Study 205203, subjects’ HES SoC therapy could have been adjusted starting 4 weeks after the 
first dose (Visit 2) of mepolizumab, when investigators were unblended to blood eosinophil levels. In 
contrast, in Study 200622, the same regimen of background HES SoC therapy was maintained 
throughout the 32-week study treatment period unless there was a worsening of symptom(s) that 
required an increase in therapy. 
Study population /Sample size 
Main inclusion criteria: 
Male and female subjects aged 12 years and older who were enrolled in Study 200622. 
• 
To be considered for Study 205203, subjects in Study 200622 must have completed 32-week 
assessments since randomization: 
o  Completion of the 32-week treatment period in Study 200622, 
o 
If the subject was withdrawn from study treatment prematurely during Study 200622 
but continued in the study per protocol (including HES flare-related assessments) until 
32 weeks from randomization. 
Main exclusion criteria  
•  Subjects with current malignancy or malignancy that developed during Study 200622. Subjects 
who had localized carcinoma (i.e., basal or squamous cell) of the skin which was resected for 
cure were not excluded. 
•  Subjects with QT interval corrected (QTc) >450 msec or QTc > 480 msec in subjects with 
bundle branch block based on local EGC reading. 
•  Current active liver or biliary disease (with the exception of Gilbert’s syndrome or 
asymptomatic gallstones or otherwise stable chronic liver disease per investigator 
assessment). 
NOTE: Stable chronic liver disease was generally defined by the absence of ascites, 
encephalopathy, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia, esophageal or gastric varices, or persistent 
jaundice, or cirrhosis. 
•  Subjects who had received treatment with an investigational agent (biologic or non-biologic) 
within the past 30 days, or 5 drug half-lives, whichever was longer, prior to the first dose, 
other than Study 200622 study treatment. 
•  Subject had an adverse event (AE) (serious or non-serious) considered related to study 
treatment while participating in Study 200622 which resulted in permanent withdrawal of study 
treatment. 
Treatments 
All subjects were to receive 300 mg SC mepolizumab every 4 weeks for a duration of 20 weeks, starting 
approximately 32 weeks after the first dose of study treatment in Study 200622.

Prior and Concomitant Medications and Non-Drug Therapies 
Use of SoC HES therapy, including OCS, immunosuppressive, or cytotoxic therapy (e.g., hydroxyurea, 
interferon alpha, cyclosporine, imatinib, methotrexate, azathioprine), was permitted during the study. 
During Study 205203, subjects’ HES SoC therapy was permitted to be adjusted starting 4 weeks after 
the first dose of mepolizumab. 
Additional therapies required to treat non-HES-related medical conditions (e.g., mAbs or IV 
immunoglobulin therapy) during the study were permitted in consultation with the MAH Medical 
Monitor and must have been prospectively captured in the eCRF. If allowed, therapy should not have 
been administered at the same time as the mepolizumab injection(s) and physicians were to have 
taken measures to separate administration of another biological therapy as long as possible from 
administration of mepolizumab. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary safety endpoints were: 
•  AEs: serious AEs (SAEs) and non-serious 
• 
anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) 
Other safety endpoints included: 
vital signs 
• 
•  12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) 
• 
hematological and clinical laboratory tests 
Efficacy Endpoints 
Efficacy assessments were considered exploratory endpoints in this study. The following endpoints 
were assessed: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
rate of HES flare 
change in the mean daily OCS (prednisone or equivalent) dose from Week 0 to 4 to Week 16 to 
20 
proportion of subjects who achieved a mean daily OCS (prednisone or equivalent) dose of ≤ 7.5 
mg during Week 16 to 20 
proportion of subjects who achieved a mean daily OCS dose reduction of ≥ 50% from Week 0 to 
4 to Week 16 to 20 for subjects with a mean OCS dose >0 mg/day during Week 0 to 4. 
Statistical Methods 
There was no sample size calculation for this study. The sample size was determined by the number of 
available subjects who were randomized in Study 200622 and were eligible for the current study based 
on the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Prior and Concomitant Medications 
Prior and concomitant medications for the subjects participating in Study 205203 were similar to that 
of Study 200622. Almost all subjects (>99%) reported using concomitant medications during this 
extension study. The most frequently reported medications categories were alimentary tract and 
metabolism (87%), systemic hormonal preparations, excluding sex hormones and insulins (87%), and 
respiratory system (84%).

Efficacy results 
Subjects remained on their SoC HES therapy while receiving mepolizumab. Investigators were permitted 
to adjust the subjects’ background HES therapy per SoC starting at Visit 2 (approximately 4 weeks after 
the 1st dose).  
Overview of HES Flares 
In total, there were 8 flares in 6 (12%) subjects previously treated with placebo and 3 flares in 3 (6%) 
subjects (1 flare each) previously treated with mepolizumab.

Rate of HES Flares 
Overall, the estimated annualized rate of HES flares based on the 20-week treatment period was 
0.26/year (95% CI 0.13, 0.52). 
Subjects in Study 205203 who were previously treated with mepolizumab in Study 200622 had the 
lowest annualized rate of HES flares (adjusted mean rate/year: 0.14; 95% CI 0.04, 0.49). Subjects in 
Study 205203 who were previously treated with placebo in Study 200622 showed a similar annualized 
rate of HES flares to that observed in Study 200622 for subjects treated with mepolizumab (adjusted 
mean rate/year: 0.37 for both groups).

Treatment Policy Estimand, Safety Population) 
Change in Mean Daily OCS Dose from Week 0 to 4 to Week 16 to 20 
As not all subjects were treated with OCS at Baseline, a separate analysis was performed including 
only those subjects with an OCS dose >0 mg during Week 0 to 4 to evaluate the effect of mepolizumab 
on OCS treatment. In the 73 subjects with a mean Week 0 to 4 OCS dose >0 mg/day (prednisone or 
equivalent), the mean dose of OCS (prednisone or equivalent) in Week 0 to 4 was 11.2 mg/day. The 
mean dose in these subjects decreased over time, with a mean dose of 10.6 mg/day at Week 4 to 8 
and Week 8 to 12, 9.5 mg/day at Week 12 to 16, and 8.9 mg/day at Week 16 to 20. The mean change 
from Baseline OCS dose during Week 16 to 20 was -2.3 mg/day (prednisone or equivalent); a greater 
mean reduction was observed in subjects previously treated with placebo (-3.1 mg/day) compared 
with subjects previously treated with mepolizumab (-1.5 mg/day). 
Proportion of Subjects Who Achieved a Mean Daily OCS Dose ≤7.5mg during Week 16 to 20 
The proportion of all subjects who achieved a mean OCS dose ≤7.5mg/day (prednisone or equivalent) 
was 75% during Week 16 to 20 compared with 61% during Week 0 to 4.

Proportion of Subjects Who Achieved a Mean Daily OCS Dose Reduction of ≥50% during Week 
16 to 20 
During Week 16 to 20, 28% of all subjects with a mean Week 0 to 4 OCS dose >0 mg/day (prednisone 
or equivalent) had achieved a mean daily OCS dose reduction of 50%; a larger proportion of subjects 
previously treated with placebo achieved this reduction (37%) compared with subjects previously 
treated with mepolizumab (18%). 
b) MHE100185 study:  
A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Parallel Group Phase III Study to 
Evaluate Corticosteroid reduction and -sparing Effects of Mepolizumab 750mg Intravenously in 
Subjects with Hypereosinophilic Syndrome (HES), and to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of 
Mepolizumab in Controlling the Clinical Signs and Symptoms of HES over Nine Months. 
• 
Study Participants  
This was a randomised placebo-controlled study comparing the addition of mepolizumab or placebo to 
prednisone therapy in patients whose clinical symptoms were stabilised with the use of prednisone 
monotherapy (20 to 60 mg/day).  It was conducted from March 2004 to March 2006 in 26 centres: 11 
in the USA (46% of the patients), 9 in the EU (3 in Belgium, 3 in Germany, 2 in France and one in 
Italy), 4 in Canada, and 2 in Australia. 
Eligible subjects were: 
•  males and females, 18 to 85 years of age 
•  with  a  documented  history  of  HES:  peripheral  blood  eosinophils  >1500 cells/µL  for  at  least 
6 months and signs/symptoms of organ system involvement or dysfunction directly related to 
eosinophilia  and  no  evidence  of  parasitic,  allergic,  or  other  recognised  causes  of  eosinophilia 
after comprehensive evaluation 
•  with a negative test for the presence of the FIP1-PGFRAα fusion gene 
•  with  a  stable  prednisone monotherapy  status  prior to  randomization,  as  reflected  by  a  blood 
eosinophil count <1000 cells/µL with no new or worsening HES signs/symptoms on ≥20 mg to 
≤60 mg once daily for at least 1 week. 
Subjects that tested positive for FIP1L1-PDGFRα fusion gene were excluded from the study population, 
since they usually have a more aggressive myeloproliferative disease and develop acute myelogenous 
eosinophilic leukaemia.  
• 
Treatments  
The study comprised a Screening Visit, a prednisone run-in and stabilization period, a baseline Visit, a 
Treatment Period of 36 weeks and a Safety Follow Up (FU) Visit. After the initial screening, subjects 
will washout all the other HES medications, switch to prednisone and/or adjust their prednisone dose 
in order to achieve a stable prednisone monotherapy status. The Treatment Period commenced at Day 
1 after randomization and completes at Week 36. Central randomization was applied using randomly 
permuted blocks within two strata based upon subjects' stable entry prednisone daily doses of ≤ 30 
mg or >30 mg. Subjects in each strata were randomized at 1:1 ratio to receive either 750 mg 
mepolizumab iv infusion, or saline (as placebo) iv infusion every 4 weeks beginning from Day 1 until 
the last infusion at Week 32. Weekly prednisone taper started one week after the first dose following 
the Prednisone Taper Schedule.  The maximum total study duration for a participating subject was 51 
weeks.  
Assessment report  
EMA/560938/2021  
Page 74/140 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
The infusion solution, either mepolizumab 750 mg or saline, was administered over approximately 
30 minutes once every 4 weeks beginning at Day 1 after randomisation until the last dose at Week 32, 
i.e. a total of 9 infusions.  Patients received their infusions in the clinic.  No other treatment for HES 
was permitted than prednisone (or equivalent).  After screening, patients entered a run-in period of up 
to 6 weeks, during which all other treatments had to be discontinued and prednisone monotherapy was 
administered to achieve a stable clinical status as previously defined.  Starting one week after the first 
infusion of the tested drug, prednisone taper followed a predefined weekly schedule.   
Unblinded blood eosinophil counts were provided to investigators throughout the study since this was 
essential to guide disease management and the steroid tapering schedule in accordance with 
predefined guidelines.   
• 
Objectives 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who achieved a total daily prednisone dose of 
≤10mg for a period of 8 consecutive weeks.   
The following secondary endpoints were analyzed in a hierarchical manner for statistical differences 
between the placebo and mepolizumab treatment groups:  
1.  Proportion  of  subjects  who  maintained  a  blood  eosinophil  count  of  <600/μL  for  a  period  of  8 
consecutive weeks during the Treatment Period.  
2. Time until treatment failure with treatment failure defined as clinical worsening requiring other HES 
based therapy or an increase of prednisone dose to >60mg/day per discretion of the investigator, or 
withdrawal from the study for any reason.  
3. Proportion of subjects who achieved a total daily prednisone dose of ≤7.5mg (sub-adrenal threshold) 
during the Treatment Period.  
4. Proportion of subjects who were corticosteroid-free during the Treatment Period.  
5. Mean total daily dose of prednisone.  
6.  Component  analysis  of  QoL  and  current  health  status:  improvement  to  physical  summary  score 
analysis of the SF-12v2. 
7. Component analysis of QoL and current health status: improvement to mental summary score analysis 
of the SF-12v2.  
8. Proportion of subjects who achieved a total daily prednisone dose of ≤10mg within 20 weeks and who 
maintained a total daily prednisone dose of ≤10mg for a period of 8 consecutive weeks.  
9. Proportion of subjects who achieved total prednisone daily doses 12 weeks after randomization in the 
following categories: 0mg, 2.5-7.5mg, 10mg and >10mg, respectively. 
10. Pruritus visual analogue scale (pVAS).  
11. Erythema/oedema score.

and 43 to mepolizumab. Of the 22 screen failures, most (77%) were due to not fulfilling eligibility 
criteria for randomization. Demographics were generally comparable between the treatment groups. 
The majority of subjects were White (85%), >45 years of age (59%) (mean age 48 years) and 
received ≤30mg prednisone/day at baseline (71%). Overall, the distribution of sex was balanced; 
however there was a greater proportion of males in the mepolizumab group (60%) compared with the 
placebo group (40%). Most subjects (73%) had HES ≤5 years; 39% of subjects had HES for ≤1 year. 
Mean duration of the disease was greater in the placebo group (6.5 years) compared with the 
mepolizumab group (4.3 years). The mean age at onset was 43 years. The most prominent current 
HES-related conditions included skin/subcutaneous tissue disorders (47%) and respiratory disorders 
(41%). The incidence of skin disorders was higher in the placebo group (57%) than in the

mepolizumab group (37%). While the mepolizumab groups were generally comparable across regions 
patients in the NA placebo group were likely to be more severe than those in the ROW placebo group 
as reflected by baseline prednisone dose, incidence of prior HES therapies and HES-related medical 
conditions. 
The majority of subjects randomized to the mepolizumab group (84%) completed the study, whereas 
the majority of subjects in the placebo group (64%) withdrew, primarily due to lack of efficacy (50% of 
subjects).  
The patient disposition by region is shown in the table below. 
Table 30: The patient disposition 
Primary endpoint 
The proportion of responders for the primary endpoint was almost two-fold greater in the mepolizumab 
group (84%) compared with the placebo group (43%) and this difference was statistically significant 
Statistically significant differences were also observed in the proportion of responders between 
mepolizumab and placebo in the two baseline prednisone dose subgroups, with the difference being 
greater in the >30mg subgroup. In the analysis of primary endpoint, the Breslow-Day test did not 
reveal a statistically significant treatment by baseline prednisone dose level interaction.  
The difference between the primary response rate (84% vs. 43%) was essentially due to the 
differential withdrawal rate between placebo (23/24 non responders) and mepolizumab (4/7 non 
responders) because, in this analysis, all withdrawals before the primary endpoint was achieved were 
assumed to be non-responders. However, the trial cannot be considered fully blinded since the 
investigator had access to blood eosinophil counts in order to adjust the prednisone tapering and might 
have been keen to enrol patients into the open label extension of the trial after withdrawal from the 
controlled trial.  Therefore, this ‘missing as failure’ analysis has the potential to be highly biased in 
favour of mepolizumab.  The MAH has not provided any evidence that these withdrawals were actually 
due to lack of efficacy in compliance with the protocol guidelines on prednisone taper and rescue.  In 
the absence of detailed and documented information on the reason for each individual withdrawal from 
the study, the results of the primary ‘missing as failure’ analysis cannot provide a reliable estimate of 
the efficacy of mepolizumab.

Table 31 : Proportion of patients achieving a total daily prednisone dose of ≤10mg for a 
period of at least 8 consecutive weeks 
The taper or weaning off prednisone can be considered beneficial as long as the disease remains well-
controlled, based not only on blood eosinophil counts but also on an evaluation of the disease 
progression and the incidence, type, severity of the clinical flares occurring throughout the study.  
Such information is lacking although it is clear from the safety analyses that numerous HES-related 
events occurred during the study. 
Although agreed with the Regulatory Authorities, the primary endpoint, i.e. the proportion of patients 
achieving a daily prednisone dose ≤ 10 mg for at least 8 consecutive weeks, does not appear a hard 
endpoint, especially for subjects on 20 mg/day at baseline.  This is illustrated by a response rate of 
100% in the 14 placebo patients on baseline prednisone dose of 20 mg/day.  Therefore, more weight 
is given to more stringent endpoints. 
Treatment-by-region interaction   
The Breslow-Day test shows statistically significant treatment by region interaction with a p-
value=0.006.  The treatment effect is evident in North America, with the response rates being 24% in 
placebo group and 86% in the mepolizumab group. On the other hand, no treatment effect can be 
seen in the Rest of the World region, with the response rates being 85% and 82% in placebo and 
active treatment groups, respectively.

Table 32: Analysis of Proportion of Subjects who Achieved a Total Daily Prednisone dose of 
<=10mg for a Period of at Least 8 Consecutive Weeks Stratified by Region (ITT population) 
It can be seen in the table below that the treatment wise proportions of baseline prednisone levels are 
different between the regions. This imbalance may, at least partially, explain the significant interaction, 
since, as noticed earlier the treatment effect seems to depend on the baseline prednisone level. 
Individual centers were not considered in the analyses because of the small number of subjects in each 
center.  
However, since placebo patients in North America were likely to be more severe than those in the 
ROW, this could explain why they were more likely to drop out. Thus, the imbalance in severity across 
regions coupled with the imbalance in assignment to placebo, suggests that this interaction can be 
explained.

Secondary endpoints.  
In the pivotal study, secondary endpoints were met for steroid sparing effects and reduction of 
eosinophil counts. Skin manifestations and pruritus were not changed Quality of life results did not 
show a clear effect. Comparisons of following secondary endpoints showed statistically significant 
overall difference between the response rates of mepolizumab and placebo groups:  
1.  proportion  of  subjects  who  maintained  blood  eosinophil  count  <600/ul  for  a  period  of  at  least  8 
consecutive weeks during treatment period,  
2. proportion of subjects who achieved a total daily prednisone dose of ≤7.5mg during the treatment 
period  
3. proportion of subjects who were corticosteroid-free during the treatment period.  
However, the Breslow-Day test revealed a statistically significant treatment by baseline prednisone 
dose level interaction (endpoints 1. and 2.; nearly statistically significant P-value=0.075 in endpoint 
3.). Further, it is well known that the power of B-D test to detect even rather large clinically 
meaningful differences between odds ratios across strata is rather poor. The reason for the observed 
interactions is that the response rates in the placebo group of ≤ 30 mg prednisone strata are 
constantly higher than in the placebo group of >30 mg prednisone, but the response rates in the 
mepolizumab group are very similar over baseline prednisone strata. The results give an evidence for 
the claim that the difference between mepolizumab and placebo treatments depends on the level of 
baseline prednisone dose.  
Control of end-organ damage 
The long-term clinical benefits for morbidity or mortality resulting from reduction of end-organ 
complications or corticosteroid sparing are not evident based on current studies. No improvement or 
deterioration was observed in Neurological Examinations, Pulmonary function tests, CT scans of the 
abdomen, sinuses, or chest at Week 36, Echocardiograms or skin (based on Skin photographs).  
In spite of the protocol planning repeated skin and GI tissue biopsies in patients affected at baseline, 
data were only available for 3 patients, respectively.  This might have permitted to collect useful 
supporting information on eosinophil infiltration in these tissues since the level of eosinophilia is not a 
true reflection of organ damage. 
c) Study MHE100901:  
An Open-label Extension Study to Study MHE100185, to Evaluate Long-term Safety, Efficacy and 
Optimal Dosing Frequency of 750 mg Intravenous Mepolizumab in Subjects with Hypereosinophilic 
Syndrome. 
This open-label study is an extension to Study MHE100185. It was designed to investigate the long-
term safety, efficacy, and optimal dosing frequency of mepolizumab 750 mg IV infusion in subjects 
with various clinical manifestations of HES. The planned duration of the study was approximately 39 
months. This study however was terminated by the sponsor (29 September 2010). Subjects eligible to 
continue mepolizumab treatment were transferred into the compassionate use program (study 
MHE104317). 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term safety of mepolizumab 750 mg IV 
infusion at maximum dosing frequency of once every month in subjects with HES.  
Of the 85 subjects who participated in Study MHE100185, 78 subjects enrolled and received treatment 
in MHE100901 (ITT Population).  
Assessment report  
EMA/560938/2021

A subject could be withdrawn from the study at any time at the investigator's discretion or at the 
request of the subject. The reason for withdrawal was documented for all subjects prematurely 
withdrawing from the study. The most common reasons for withdrawal were adverse events and lack 
of efficacy (6 subjects for each). All study subjects received mepolizumab 750mg IV in variable dosing 
schedules in 3 stages: 
• Stage 1: HES Medication Taper and Stabilization Period 
• Stage 2: Optimization of Dosing Frequency 
• Stage 3: Assessment of Long-Term Safety and Efficacy 
Patient disposition 
A total of 78 subjects from 23 centers were enrolled and received treatment in MHE100901; 38 
subjects previously received placebo and 40 subjects previously received mepolizumab in Study 
MHE100185. There were no screen failures. Randomized subjects from study MHE100185 continued 
into this extension study: 36 in the United States, 27 in Europe (7 in Belgium, 7 in Germany, 10 in 
France and 3 in Italy), 8 in Canada, and 7 in Australia. Seven subjects did not continue from study 
MHE100185 into the extension study MHE100901. 
Fifty-four subjects (69%) withdrew due to study MHE100901 termination by the sponsor. Ten subjects 
(13%) withdrew due to an AE. No subjects were withdrawn due to disease progression. 
Results  
Almost all subjects (43/48, 90%) who entered in Stage 2 with a daily prednisone dose of ≤10 mg were 
able to maintain a daily prednisone dose of ≤10 mg (as sole background therapy) for a continuous 
period of at least 12 weeks. The majority of subjects (22/30, 73%) who entered in Stage 1 with a daily 
prednisone dose of >10 mg achieved a daily prednisone dose of ≤10 mg (as sole background therapy) 
for a continuous period of at least 12 weeks. Eight of 20 responders remained at a daily prednisone 
dose of ≤10 mg for a continuous period of ≥144 weeks. 
The mean daily prednisone dose for all subjects over the course of the study (5 mg) was lower 
compared with the mean baseline prednisone dose (12 mg). At the end of the study, 53 (68%) were 
corticosteroid-free and 25 (32%) were receiving corticosteroids. 
Median eosinophil counts remained below 300 cells/μL at most post-baseline assessments for subjects 
receiving mepolizumab monotherapy or mepolizumab in conjunction with prednisone. At the end of 
Stage 2, nearly half of the subjects (30/59,51%) had a dosing interval between infusions that was >12 
weeks. Median pVAS scores and erythema/oedema scores were low at baseline and remained low 
during treatment. 
Minimal changes from baseline in median pVAS and median total erythema/oedema scores were 
observed. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The MAH submitted a single pivotal placebo-controlled Phase III study, 200622 in support of this 
marketing authorization application. This study was supplemented with efficacy data from the OLE 
study 205203. Studies MHE100185 and MHE100901 were also provided by the MAH however, due to 
differences in patient population, endpoints, eosinophil blinding, and mepolizumab doses the role of 
these studies in support of this application is limited.  
Assessment report  
EMA/560938/2021  
Page 80/140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The MAH submitted a marketing authorization procedure for the treatment in patients with HES 
(EMEA/H/C/001069/00) back in September 2008. This application was withdrawn in July 2009 as it 
was considered that the submitted data was insufficient to grant the marketing authorization.  
A dose of mepolizumab 300 mg administered SC every 4 weeks was selected for investigation in the 
pivotal study supporting this marketing authorization application. This dose was lower as compared to 
the dose investigated previously (i.e. 750 mg every 4 weeks) in studies MHE100185 and MHE100901. 
This new dose was based on the results of meta-analysis of 16 previous clinical trials investigating 
mepolizumab in several indications and integrating PK/PD data. The analysis shows that the clinical 
benefit beyond the planned dose of 300 mg sc q4w would be limited. This dose selection strategy was 
discussed as a part of the CHMP scientific advice and the approach taken by the MAH was considered 
acceptable.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In the pivotal study (200622) subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive either placebo or mepolizumab 
300 mg subcutaneous (SC) every 4 weeks in addition to their maintenance HES treatment. The study 
consisted of 3 periods: screening (4 weeks), double-blind treatment period (32 weeks) and follow-up 
(8 weeks).Subjects that completed the 32-week treatment period were eligible to screen for a 20- 
week open label extension (study 205203) where all subjects received mepolizumab 300 mg SC every 
4 weeks. 
Study population  
The study was enrolling adult patients with at least 6-month diagnosis of HES. The diagnosis of HES 
was based on signs or symptoms of organ system involvement or dysfunction that could be directly 
related to high blood (>1500 eosinophils/μL) or tissue eosinophilia without a discernible secondary 
cause. The diagnostic criteria used in the study were similar to those proposed by Valent, 2012 and 
therefore they are considered acceptable.  
The 200622 study was aimed to enrol a more severe HES population with a greater likelihood of 
experiencing a flare while receiving stable maintenance HES treatment. Therefore, at screening all 
patients were required to have blood eosinophil count >1000 cells/uL despite receiving SoC therapy. In 
addition, a history of two or more HES flares within the past 12 months prior to screening were 
required for enrolment.  
HES encompasses a heterogeneous group of rare hematologic disorders with widely variable end organ 
complications and prognosis. This has led to the concept of HES subtypes or variants that can be 
distinguished on the basis of clinical and laboratory characteristics. In the 200622 study, HES variants 
were not required to be specified for enrolment with exception to patients with F/P fusion tyrosine 
kinase gene translocation. These patients were excluded from the study. Although many HES patients 
do not meet diagnostic criteria for any of the defined subtypes, the MAH was requested to provide 
information on the percentage of patients for whom HES variant was identified prior to the enrolment. 
The MAH clarified that the information on subtypes were not collected at baseline. 
Patients with clinically significant cardiac damage, current active liver or biliary disease liver (with ALT 
>2.5xULN or ALT>5xULN or Bilirubin >1.5xULN) or life-threatening HES were excluded from the study.  
The SmPC was therefore updated to state in section 4.4 of the SmPC that Nucala has not been studied 
in patients with life-threatening manifestations of HES. 
Study treatment  
In the study, patients received either placebo or mepolizumab 300 mg subcutaneous (SC) every 4 
weeks in addition to their maintenance HES treatment. A stable dose of OCS, immunosuppressive or 
Assessment report  
EMA/560938/2021  
Page 81/140 
 
 
 
cytotoxic therapy (e.g., hydroxyurea, IFNα, cyclosporine, imatinib, methotrexate, azathioprine) was 
permitted in the study.  
If a subject had worsening of symptoms and required an increase in therapy after randomization, the 
subject was considered to have experienced a flare.  
In case of an asymptomatic increase in eosinophil levels, triggered blinded OCS treatment could be 
initiated.  A second increase in eosinophil levels which required such treatment was classified as a 
flare. In addition, each subsequent course of blinded active OCS beyond 14 days from the resolution 
date of the preceding flare was considered as an additional flare (e.g., 3 courses of blinded active OCS 
were considered as 2 flares, 4 courses of blinded active OCS are considered as 3 flares, etc.).  
Study endpoints  
Primary endpoint  
The primary endpoint in this study was the proportion of subjects who experienced a HES flare during 
the 32-week Treatment Period. HES flares were defined as either: (a) a HES-related clinical 
manifestation based on a physician documented change in clinical signs or symptoms resulting in the 
need for therapy adjustment (increase in OCS dose of at least 10mg/day or any increase in or addition 
of any cytotoxic/ immunosuppressive HES therapy), or (b) receipt of two or more courses of blinded 
active OCS during the study treatment period. 
This endpoint was discussed during the CHMP scientific advice. While this primary endpoint has never 
been tested in previous trials, in principle, it was considered acceptable and clinically relevant for the 
selected target population.   
The clinical presentation of HES covers a wide variety of end-organ manifestations. It is acknowledged 
that challenges exist in establishing an objective definition of flare in this disease. To improve the 
objectivity of this assessment the HES Core Assessments were utilized by investigators to characterize 
the disease at baseline and also to monitor the changes during the treatment period and the flare.  
However, as stated in the study report investigators ultimately used their clinical judgment to 
determine if a subject was experiencing a HES flare.   
The definitions used to identify flares was based on an increase in the maintenance OCS dose by 
greater than or equal to 10 mg/day. The MAH clarified that although some events of OCS dose 
increase were less than 10 mg/day or for fewer than 5 days and therefore not reported as a flare, the 
number of such events was small i.e. 3 patients in the mepolizumab treated group received an 
increase in OCS dose not fulfilling the definition of a HES flare as compared to 7  placebo treated 
patients.  It is agreed with the MAH that this is unlikely to affect the study results. 
It needs to be highlighted that the efficacy of mepolizumab in preventing of development of HES flares 
was investigated in patients for whom background medications were maintained.  In clinical practice, 
however withdrawing background medications, especially oral corticosteroids would be an important 
treatment goal.  
Three out of 4 secondary endpoints under multiplicity adjustment strategy were also investigated the 
effect of mepolizumab on flares. These endpoints were: time to first HES flare, proportion of subjects 
who experienced a HES flare during Week 20 through Week 32 and rate of HES flares.  
A primary focus of the pivotal study was the assessment of efficacy of mepolizumab in reducing 
exacerbations (flares). On the other hand, the effects of mepolizumab on other aspects of the disease 
or symptoms were only briefly examined. 
Assessment report  
EMA/560938/2021  
Page 82/140 
 
 
 
 
Various patient reported outcome questionnaires were used in the study to assess changes in 
symptoms in patients receiving mepolizumab as compared to those on placebo. However, only one 
endpoint investigating the effect on fatigue severity (Brief Fatigue Inventory [BFI]) score item 3) was 
under multiplicity adjustment strategy. The CHMP requested the MAH to justify the use of this endpoint 
for the assessment of patients with HES as detailed below. The clarification was considered acceptable. 
The MAH clarified that prior to designing the pivotal HES study, they ran a dedicated PRO study with 
the HES team at the US National Institute of Health (NIH) in order to create a HES PRO as there is no 
validated PRO in HES available. Unfortunately, the results of the HES PRO study with NIH were too 
heterogeneous and a HES specific PRO was unable to be established [Kovacs, 2020]. In light of these 
results, the MAH discussed and agreed with a HES expert that it would be appropriate to use the BFI in 
HES to capture the patient perspective of fatigue, a key symptom of HES.  
Exploratory assessments in respect to changes in symptoms scores included the use of the following 
scales: HES Daily Symptoms (HES-DS), Clinician- and Subject-Rated Overall Response to Therapy 
Score (RTS), Subject-Rated Symptom Severity (SSR) and Modified Memorial symptom Assessment 
Scale-Short Form (MSAS-SF).  
Organ-specific disease activity was investigated through the use of the lung function test and 
echocardiogram scans.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In total, 108 subjects were randomized and received at least one dose of study treatment (54 to 
placebo and 54 to mepolizumab). The majority of subjects in the ITT Population completed the study 
(104, 96%) and 102 subjects continued treatment in the OLE study 205203 (94%). Of the 6 (6%) 
subjects who prematurely discontinued study treatment, 4 subjects also withdrew from the study and 
2 continued participation in the study until Week 32 and Follow-up.  
Baseline characteristics  
Overall, the majority of the subjects enrolled to this pivotal study were white (93%) and more than 
half were female (53%). The mean age was 46.0 years and approximately 83% of the subjects were 
between 19 and 64 years of age. Only 14 subjects were over 65 years of age and only 4 adolescents 
were enrolled to this study.  
People with HES may suffer from a wide variety of symptoms, depending upon which parts of the body 
are affected. The MAH presented HES related symptoms reported by patients at baseline which were 
varied across subjects; breathing symptoms were the most common and were reported by 56% of 
subjects in both treatment groups.  
At baseline, almost all subjects (92%) had received regular maintenance medications for HES.  OCS 
were used most frequently (72%). The median dose was 5.6 mg/day and maximum dose of 50 
mg/day. More subjects in the mepolizumab group (26%) were receiving cytotoxic/immunosuppressive 
therapy at baseline compared with the placebo group (17%). In line with the trial protocol, the dose of 
the maintenance/ background medications for HES should not be changed during the study.  
The information regarding the baseline characteristic of the study population provided by the MAH was 
insufficient.  The following additional information was requested to be provided: 
- 
The number of HES flares within the past 12 months prior to Screening and percentage of 
patients who reported two, three or more flares in the past 12 months. The primary endpoint 
results should be provided depending on the number of flares prior to screening 
Assessment report  
EMA/560938/2021

- 
blood eosinophil count at screening. The MAH should also clarify the percentage of patients for 
whom diagnosis of HES were made on the basis of tissue eosinophil as opposite to blood 
eosinophila  
The MAH provided information on the number of HES flares within the past 12 months prior to 
Screening and percentage of patients who reported two, three or more flares in the past 12 months. It 
is noted that the distribution of the frequency of HES flares pre-study was similar across both 
treatment groups. Further, the efficacy was shown both in patients who reported two flares and in 
patients who reported three or more flares in the past 12 months. The mean Blood Eosinophil Count 
(10^9/L) at Screening was 1.69 in the placebo group and 1.50 in the treatment group. 
Primary endpoint results  
The  proportion  of  subjects  who  experience  a  HES  flare  during  the  32-week  treatment  period  was 
investigated as a primary endpoint in this study.  
This primary endpoint was met as significantly less flares were reported in patients treated with 
mepolizumab as compared to those on placebo i.e. there were 17 flares in 14 (26%) subjects 
randomized to mepolizumab compared to 48 flares in 28 (52%) subjects in the placebo group. The odd 
ratio for comparison of mepolizumab 300 mg vs placebo (primary analysis) was 0.28 (95%CI (0.12, 
0.64, p value=0.003).  
The primary outcome (HES flare) was defined as: an increase in the maintenance OCS dose by at least 
10mg/day for 5 days, an increase in or addition of any cytotoxic and/or immunosuppressive HES 
therapy or receipt of two or more courses of blinded active OCS during the treatment period. 
The results of sensitivity analysis of the primary estimand and the results of the supplementary ‘while 
on treatment’ estimand and the analysis of the PP population were also consistent with the primary 
estimand.  
The MAH was requested to clarify the approach to patients who will be experiencing flares while on 
mepolizumab treatment in particular the MAH was requested to discuss in more detail what criteria 
should be used to declare the lack of efficacy in HES patients. In addition, the MAH was requested to 
discuss approach to patients for whom a long-term remission was achieved. The MAH clarified that 
there is no accepted definition of remission and/or its assessment criteria which could be used 
standardly in clinical practice to declare either lack of efficacy or achievement of long-term remission. 
The decision to stop or continue mepolizumab treatment of HES patients shall be based on the 
physician’s clinical judgment, which is guided by the patient’s overall clinical status and its background 
medication. Therefore ,the following text was included in the SmPC section 4.1.and agreed with CHMP, 
reflecting also that mepolizumab was not studied in patients with life-threatening HES condition.: 
Nucala is intended for long-term treatment. The need for continued therapy should be considered 
reviewed at least on an annual basis determined by physician assessment of the patient’s disease 
severity and level of symptom control. Patients who develop life-threatening manifestations of HES 
should also be evaluated for the need for continued therapy, as Nucala has not been studied in this 
population 
Secondary and exploratory endpoints  
Three out of 4 secondary endpoints (under multiplicity adjustment strategy) were also based around 
flares. The results of these secondary endpoints were consistent with the primary endpoint results. The 
risk of a first HES flare over the treatment period was 66% lower for subjects treated with 
mepolizumab compared with placebo (hazard ratio: 0.34; 95% CI 0.18, 0.67). From Week 20 through 
Week 32, fewer subjects experienced a HES flare or withdrew from the study when treated with 
Assessment report  
EMA/560938/2021  
Page 84/140 
 
 
 
mepolizumab compared with placebo (17% vs. 35% respectively, p=0.020). Finally, the treatment 
with mepolizumab resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the annualized rate of HES flares 
(calculated for each subject as number of HES flares divided by time in the study) compared with 
placebo (adjusted p=0.020).  
Only one secondary endpoint was not investigating flares but assessed the effect on fatigue severity by 
using Brief Fatigue Inventory [BFI]) score.  Using this score a statistically significant reduction in 
fatigue severity was reported at Week 32 for subjects treated with mepolizumab compared to those in 
the placebo group (unadjusted p=0.036; adjusted p=0.036).  
Some exploratory endpoints also recorded improvements in symptoms. For HES Daily Symptoms 
(HES-DS) scale there was a significant reduction (improvement) in the most bothersome symptom 
score at Week 32 for subjects treated with mepolizumab compared with placebo.  
Only limited organ-specific assessments were performed in the study i.e. lung function tests and 
echocardiogram scans. These tests showed no difference between the treatment groups. Other 
assessments such as neurological examinations, CT scans of the abdomen, sinuses, or chest, or skin 
assessments were not performed. The MAH clarified that while cardiac dysfunction is a progress event 
that can be monitored and associated with hypereosinophilia [Lefebvre 1989], others are episodic or 
no objective monitoring measures are available.  Some of organ involvements are predominantly 
shown as symptoms without objective assessment, e.g., gastrointestinal involvement is assessed by 
presence of abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, or diarrhea [Williams, 2016], the assessment of control 
of disease activity is the combination of subjective (symptoms) and objective (signs) measures. This 
justification was considered acceptable. 
The primary endpoint results were also examined in the subgroup depending on age, sex, race, 
geographic region, weight, baseline OCS, and baseline blood eosinophils. The MAH claimed that in all 
these subgroups, the proportion of subjects who experienced ≥1 HES flare or who withdrew from the 
study during the 32-week Treatment Period was lower in the mepolizumab group compared with 
placebo.  
Long term efficacy 
The long-term efficacy was assessed in the open label extension (OLE) study 205203. 
In this study, although subjects could remain on their SoC HES therapy while receiving mepolizumab, 
investigators were permitted to adjust the subjects’ background HES therapy per SoC starting at Visit 
2 (approximately 4 weeks after the 1st dose).  
In the OLE study flares were reported infrequently with slightly better results reported in patients 
treated with mepolizumab in the parent study as compared to those who originally received placebo.  
In total, there were 8 flares in 6 (12%) subjects previously treated with placebo and 3 flares in 3 (6%) 
subjects previously treated with mepolizumab. Overall, the estimated annualized rate of HES flares 
based on the 20-week treatment period was 0.26/year (95% CI 0.13, 0.52) which was lower than the 
rate recorded in the pivotal study (0.5/year in the mepolizumab group and 1.46/year in the placebo 
group). In the extension study, some small reduction in the OCS dose was possible. The mean change 
from baseline OCS dose during Week 16 to 20 was -2.3 mg/day (prednisone or equivalent). The 
proportion of all subjects who achieved a mean OCS dose ≤7.5mg/day (prednisone or equivalent) was 
75% during Week 16 to 20 compared with 61% during Week 0 to 4.  
In general, the results of the OLE study are supportive although the limitation of the design (open 
label, lack of comparator) is noted.

The comparison to the original authorization procedures for HES  
Some limitations identified during the original procedure (EMEA/H/C/001069/00) have been addressed 
with the current submission. 
The primary endpoint in the originally submitted pivotal MHE100185 study was the proportion of 
subjects who achieved a total daily prednisone dose of ≤10mg for a period of 8 consecutive weeks.    
This primary endpoint was met however, the difference between the primary response rate (84% vs. 
43%) was essentially due to the differential withdrawal rate between placebo (23/24 non responders) 
and mepolizumab (4/7 non responders) because, in this analysis, all withdrawals before the primary 
endpoint was achieved were assumed to be non-responders. However, the trial cannot be considered 
fully blinded since the investigator had access to blood eosinophil counts in order to adjust the 
prednisone tapering and might have been keen to enrol patients into the open label extension of the 
trial after withdrawal from the controlled trial.  Therefore, this ‘missing as failure’ analysis had the 
potential to be highly biased in favour of mepolizumab.  Additionally, the MAH has not provided any 
evidence that these withdrawals were actually due to lack of efficacy in compliance with the protocol 
guidelines on prednisone taper and rescue.  
In the current submission, the percentages of patients who withdrew from the pivotal study (200622) 
in both treatment groups was very small and investigators were blinded to blood eosinophil counts of 
their patients.  
In the MHE100185 study, the disease control was not documented and information on all HES-related 
events (disease exacerbations and progression) was not provided. For this reason, it was not clear if 
patients for whom reduction in the corticosteroid dose was achieved remained stable. 
In the pivotal study (200622) provided with this submission, the effects on disease exacerbations 
(flares) were assessed in the primary endpoint and a number of secondary endpoints. 
Additional aspects related to the indication  
Various patterns of disease courses are observed in hypereosinophilic syndromes (HES). Some patients 
are experiencing a single flare without subsequent relapse. For these patients a long-term therapy is 
unlikely to be needed.  Others suffer from several relapses with intervals of complete remission. Last, 
a third set of patients have chronic persistent disease. It seems that the majority of patients enrolled 
to the pivotal study have relapsing or maybe also persistent disease.  
The following indication was initially proposed by the MAH:  
Nucala is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome. 
It was considered that the proposed indication was very broad and did not reflect the population of 
patients investigated in the pivotal study. 
The pivotal study was only enrolling the more severe patients, as all were required to have blood 
eosinophil count >1000 cells/uL despite receiving SoC therapy. In addition, a history of two or more 
HES flares within the past 12 months prior to screening were required for enrolment. In addition, 
patients with F/P fusion tyrosine kinase gene translocation were excluded. Finally, in the pivotal study 
mepolizumab was given as add on therapy to standard maintenance therapy of HES.   
During the assessment of the application, the MAH was requested by CHMP to discuss and justify why 
the criteria which defined severity of the disease were not reflected in the text of the indication.  
The applicant was requested to:

• 
• 
update the indication reflecting that Nucala is to be given to patients with relapsing or persistent 
disease i.e. receiving a chronic therapy for the HES. 
highlight that patients with ‘severe HES’ were enrolled to the pivotal study. As there is no 
accepted definition for severe HES in the medical community the use the term “inadequately 
controlled” to appropriately qualify the study population was considered more meaningful to 
prescribers. Further details of inadequate control are described in the study eligibility criteria in 
section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
Further the MAH agreed to the CHMP request to reflect the use of mepolizumab in patients without an 
identifiable non-haematologic secondary cause, based on the aetiologies of HES and the 
pharmacological activity of mepolizumab. 
The wording of the updated indication reads:  
Nucala  is  indicated  as  an  add-on  treatment  for  adult  patients  with  inadequately  controlled 
hypereosinophilic syndrome without an identifiable non-haematologic secondary cause (see Section 5.1) 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
All  concerns  in  relation  to  the  efficacy  data  is  considered  adequate  to  support  the  revised  restricted 
indication  as  an  add-on  treatment  for  adult  patients  with  inadequately  controlled  hypereosinophilic 
syndrome without an identifiable non-haematologic secondary cause.  
2.5.   Clinical safety 
Introduction 
This Safety Summary focuses on the safety data from clinical studies in subjects with hypereosinophilic 
syndrome (HES) and also includes key safety data from the broader mepolizumab development 
program. Safety data from the 193 subjects (97 exposed to mepolizumab) participating in the 2 
completed placebo-controlled Phase 3 HES studies, 200622 and MHE100185, have been integrated.  
The 300 mg subcutaneous (SC) dose for mepolizumab, which is the dose intended for registration, was 
assessed in pivotal Phase 3 placebo-controlled study 200622 and supportive open-label extension 
(OLE) study 205203. 
The 750 mg intravenous (IV) dose was assessed in completed supportive Phase 3 placebo-controlled 
study MHE100185 and completed supportive OLE study MHE100901. Additionally, doses up to 750 mg 
IV are utilized in the ongoing mepolizumab HES Expanded Access Program (EAP). 
For the assessment of mepolizumab safety, the completed MAH-sponsored clinical studies and those 
ongoing MAH-sponsored studies with interim safety data are grouped into 2 sets. 
HES Placebo Controlled Studies: HES studies 200622 and MHE100185 were integrated as these are the 
2 completed placebo-controlled studies in the HES indication. The integrated HES studies, 200622 and 
MHE100185, comprise the study grouping referred to as ‘HES Placebo Controlled Studies’; these data 
are the primary focus of this Safety Summary. 
All Studies Combined: The study grouping referred to as ‘All Studies Combined’ comprises of 
completed MAH-sponsored studies and ongoing studies with an interim report across all indications. In 
this Safety Summary, integrated summaries of demographics, exposure, incidence of SAEs and deaths

will be presented. For the completed supportive HES OLE studies 205203 and MHE100901, and for the 
ongoing mepolizumab HES EAP with an interim report, demographics, exposure, and key safety 
information, such as adverse events (AEs), SAEs, and deaths are summarized. 
Patient exposure 
A total of 97 subjects received at least 1 dose of mepolizumab in the HES Placebo Controlled Studies. 
Of these, 54 subjects were treated with mepolizumab 300 mg SC and 43 subjects were treated with 
mepolizumab 750 mg IV. Total treatment exposure in the HES Placebo Controlled Studies was 50.69 
subject-years in the integrated placebo group and 59.78 subject-years in the mepolizumab all doses 
group (32.51 subject-years in the mepolizumab 300 mg SC group and 27.27 subject-years  in the 
mepolizumab 750 mg IV group) (Table 34). Due to the design of Study MHE100185, and a larger 
number of subject withdrawals from the placebo group, the duration of exposure to mepolizumab in 
the HES Placebo Controlled Studies was approximately 17% longer than exposure to placebo. 
The majority of subjects in the HES Placebo Controlled Studies who were treated with mepolizumab 
(82%), were exposed to study treatment for 6 to <9 months (94% for mepolizumab 300 mg SC and 
67% for mepolizumab 750 mg IV). Similarly, 71% of subjects who received placebo were exposed to 
study treatment for 6 to <9 months. The mean number of treatment administrations in the HES 
Placebo Controlled Studies was 6.8 in the placebo group and 7.9 in the mepolizumab group.

OLE HES Study 205203 
A total of 102 subjects received at least 1 dose of mepolizumab 300 mg SC in Study 205203, with a total 
exposure of 39.26 subject-years. 
OLE HES Study MHE100901 
A total of 78 subjects received at least 1 dose of mepolizumab 750 mg IV in Study MHE100901, with a 
total exposure of 286.96 subject-years. 
Exposure in Ongoing Mepolizumab HES EAP 
As of the mepolizumab HES EAP iCSR cut-off date, a total of 338 patients were recorded as receiving 
at least 1 dose of mepolizumab in MHE104317. In MHE104317, the mean SC dose of mepolizumab per 
patient was calculated, and the median of these values was 823.4 mg. In addition, as of the iCSR cut-
off date, 15 patients were recorded as receiving at least 1 dose of mepolizumab in the Initial 
Compassionate Use Program and 18 patients were recorded as receiving at least 1 dose of 
mepolizumab in the NPS Guidance Program. 
Overall Exposure in HES 
Overall, 462 subjects with HES received at least 1 dose of mepolizumab (Table 35). There were 106 
HES subjects who received at least 1 dose of mepolizumab as a fixed dose of 300 mg SC, 81 HES 
subjects who received at least 1 dose of mepolizumab as a fixed dose of 750 mg IV, and a total of 359 
HES patients who received at least 1 dose of mepolizumab as a variable dose based on clinical need in 
the mepolizumab HES EAP (all patients receiving mepolizumab in the mepolizumab HES EAP are 
included in the ‘other’ dose group). Subjects participating in more than 1 study or program and 
receiving different doses of mepolizumab were counted only once in each dose category; the 750 mg 
IV dose group in the summary tables does not include those patients who received 750 mg IV in the 
mepolizumab HES EAP. Overall, 96 subjects with HES received at least 1 dose of placebo. Total 
treatment exposure of HES subjects to mepolizumab 300 mg SC was 71.41 subject-years, to 750 mg 
IV was 320.04 subject-years, and total treatment exposure in the mepolizumab HES EAP (‘other’ 
mepolizumab doses) was 1520.12 subject-years.

Program (All Studies Combined, Safety Population) 
Demographics 
In the HES Placebo Controlled Studies, the majority of subjects were White (90%), and 51% of 
subjects were female (Table 36). Subjects of African American/ African Heritage comprise 5% of the 
population, Asian subjects comprise 3% of the population, and American Indian or Alaskan Native 
subjects comprise 2% of the population. Subjects of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity comprised 16% of 
subjects where data is available (ethnicity was collected in Study 200622 only). The mean age of 
subjects in the HES Placebo Controlled Studies was 46.9 years. The majority of subjects (83%) were 
between 18 and 64 years of age and 4 subjects (2%) were ≤17 years of age. Demographics were 
balanced across the placebo and mepolizumab treatment groups.

Table 36: Demographics (HES Placebo Controlled Studies, Safety Population) 
In the HES Placebo Controlled Studies, mean disease duration was 6.02 years in the placebo group and 
4.94 years in the mepolizumab group. In both groups, the majority of subjects had HES for ≤5 years 
(73% in the placebo group and 64% in the mepolizumab group).

Adverse events  
Table 37 shows the proportion of subjects reporting the most common on-treatment AEs (defined as 
AEs with an incidence of ≥3% in any treatment group) in the HES Placebo Controlled Studies and the 
corresponding event rates adjusted for exposure (frequency of events per 1000 subject-years of 
exposure). The incidences of on-treatment AEs was similar between the placebo (92%) and 
mepolizumab all doses group (91%). The most common on-treatment AEs in the HES Placebo 
Controlled Studies in both the placebo and mepolizumab all doses groups were headache, fatigue, and 
pruritus (Table 37). The AE that occurred with a higher incidence in the mepolizumab all doses group 
compared with the placebo group (>10% difference) was URTI. Cough was reported with a >10% 
higher incidence in the placebo group compared with the mepolizumab all doses group. 
Relative risks using the CMH method were calculated for the most common on-treatment AEs for 
placebo and mepolizumab (all doses), together with the corresponding CMH-adjusted proportions 
(Figure 25). The relative risk for mepolizumab all doses vs placebo for URTI was 2.79 (95% 
confidence intervals [CI]: 1.16, 6.75). URTI and related events are described further under AESIs.

In Study 200622, it was noted that a number of subjects in both treatment groups had AEs of bleeding 
(incidence in the Haemorrhages SMQ was 7% [4/54 subjects] in the placebo group and 19% [10/54 
subjects] in the mepolizumab 300 mg SC group). A Haemorrhages SMQ was then utilized to further 
characterize these events in the integrated HES Placebo Controlled Studies; the incidence of on-
treatment AEs in the Haemorrhages SMQ was 9% (9/96 subjects) for placebo and 16% (16/97 
subjects) for mepolizumab all doses; no dose response was evident. In the HES Placebo Controlled 
Studies, 7 subjects on mepolizumab and 2 subjects on placebo reported more than one event. Except 
for one subject on mepolizumab who reported SAEs of vaginal haemorrhage and contusion (Study 
200622), all AEs in the Haemorrhages SMQ were non-serious; no events led to discontinuation of 
study treatment.  
The majority of AEs were mild or moderate in intensity, resolved, and were not considered to be drug-
related by the investigators. Seven of 16 subjects on mepolizumab, and none on placebo, reported 
concomitant medications that could increase the risk of bleeding: 1 Subject (Study 200622) 
(haematochezia, haemorrhagic erosive gastritis) had concurrent rivaroxaban, and events were 
reported in the context of hospitalization for an HES flare, and septic shock; 1 Subject (Study 200622) 
(rectal haemorrhage) had concurrent ibuprofen; 1 Subject (Study 200622) (vaginal haemorrhage, 
contusion) had concurrent warfarin; 1 Subject (Study 200622) (vaginal haemorrhage, contusion) had 
concurrent medroxyprogesterone acetate; 1 Subject (Study 200622) (epistaxis, contusion) had 
concurrent naproxen; 1 Subject (Study MHE100185) (epistaxis, ecchymosis) had concurrent warfarin 
and aspirin; and 1 Subject (Study MHE100185) (epistaxis) had concurrent warfarin. 
Eight subjects on mepolizumab and 2 subjects on placebo reported events after the 1st dose of study 
treatment. In Study 205203 (OLE to 200622), the incidence of AEs in the Haemorrhages SMQ was 4% 
(4/102 subjects). All events were non-serious and did not lead to study treatment discontinuation. For 
context, AEs in the Haemorrhage SMQs in the placebo-controlled studies across indications were 
reviewed. In the integrated placebo-controlled studies in severe asthma and the integrated placebo-
controlled studies in COPD, the incidences of on-treatment AEs in the Haemorrhages SMQ were similar 
between the placebo and mepolizumab groups. In severe eosinophilic asthma, this was 6% (39/690 
subjects) in the integrated placebo group vs 5% (59/1188 subjects) in the mepolizumab all doses 
group. In severe COPD, this was 6% (38/645 subjects) in the integrated placebo group vs 7% (58/865 
subjects) in the mepolizumab all doses group mepolizumab doses in the severe asthma studies were

100 mg SC, 250 mg IV, and 750 mg IV. Mepolizumab doses in the COPD studies were 100 mg SC and 
300 mg SC. In the integrated placebo-controlled studies in CRSwNP, the incidences of AEs in the 
Haemorrhages SMQ were 11% (29/253 subjects) in the integrated placebo group and 9% (24/259 
subjects) in the mepolizumab all doses group. Mepolizumab doses in the CRSwNP studies were 100 mg 
SC and 750 mg IV. In the placebo-controlled study in EGPA, the incidences of AEs in the 
Haemorrhages SMQ were 13% (9/68 subjects) in the placebo group and 13% (9/68 subjects) in the 
mepolizumab 300 mg SC group. There was no evidence of dose response between mepolizumab doses 
ranging from 100 mg SC to 750 mg IV in any of the clinical programs. There is no known mechanism 
for anti-IL-5 effects on bleeding potential. 
In summary, the incidences of events in the Haemorrhages SMQ in the HES Placebo Controlled Studies 
were 9% (9/96 subjects) in the placebo group and 16% (16/97 subjects) in the mepolizumab all doses 
group. Review of the events showed that the vast majority were non-serious, resolved, and none led 
to treatment discontinuation. Seven of 16 subjects on mepolizumab and none on placebo reported 
concomitant medications that could increase the risk of bleeding, including 4 subjects on 
anticoagulants. In Study 205203 (OLE to 200622), the incidences of AEs in the Haemorrhages SMQ 
were 4% (4/102 subjects). The incidences of events in the Haemorrhages SMQ were similar between 
placebo and mepolizumab treatment groups in the severe eosinophilic asthma, severe COPD, CRSwNP, 
and EGPA placebo-controlled studies. No dose response was evident in the HES Placebo Controlled 
Studies, nor in the integrated placebo-controlled studies in other indications. Given the totality of the 
clinical data and lack of biological plausibility, a causal association between mepolizumab and 
haemorrhagic events is unlikely. 
Adverse Events by Maximum Intensity 
The maximum intensity for the majority of on-treatment AEs in the HES Placebo Controlled Studies 
was mild or moderate intensity (72% in the placebo group and 63% in the mepolizumab group). The 
incidence of events of severe intensity was 20% in the placebo group and 28% in the mepolizumab 
group. The most frequently reported AEs of severe intensity (>1% of subjects in either treatment 
group) were pruritus, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting, oropharyngeal pain, arthralgia, headache, 
and HES in the placebo group, and fatigue, dyspnoea, vomiting, contusion, renal failure, and HES in 
the mepolizumab group. 
Drug-Related Adverse Events 
The incidence of on-treatment AEs considered to be drug-related by the investigators was 20% in the 
placebo group and 29% in the mepolizumab group (Table 38). The incidence of each drug-related AE 
PT was low, and the PTs reported for ≥3% of subjects in either treatment group were fatigue, injection 
site reaction, peripheral swelling, arthralgia, myalgia, headache, cough, and dyspnoea. None of the on-
treatment drug-related AEs reported in the HES Placebo Controlled Studies was serious.

Table 38: On-Treatment Drug-Related Adverse Events Occurring in >1 Subject in the 
Integrated Placebo or Mepolizumab All Doses Group (HES Placebo Controlled Studies, Safety 
Population) 
Post-Treatment Adverse Events 
Post-treatment AEs were defined as events with an onset of >28 days after the last dose of study 
treatment. The incidences of post-treatment AEs in the HES Placebo Controlled Studies were similar 
between the placebo group (8%) and the mepolizumab group (6%). The post-treatment AEs reported 
for >1 subject overall were nausea (2 subjects; 1 in each group) and dyspnea (2 subjects; both in the 
mepolizumab group). For 3 subjects (3%) (all in the mepolizumab group) the post-treatment event 
was an SAE; these subjects had 1 SAE each: gastroenteritis, rhinitis, and dehydration. 
The most frequently reported SOC in both treatment groups was Infections and Infestations, and the 
incidence was higher in the mepolizumab group (68%) compared with the placebo group (53%) 
(Table 39); this imbalance is explained by increased incidence of URTI in the mepolizumab group 
(18%) vs the placebo group (6%) (Table 37). The other SOC with a ≥10% difference between 
treatment groups were Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders (Table 39), which is likely 
explained by the results of the MHE100185 study where a significantly greater proportion of subjects in 
the mepolizumab group achieved a prednisone dose of ≤7.5 mg per day or became prednisone-free 
during the treatment period compared with placebo. Therefore, an increase in musculoskeletal events 
(e.g., myalgia in Study MHE100185 and in the integrated dataset, but not in Study 200622) in the 
mepolizumab group compared with placebo is likely due to secondary adrenal insufficiency subsequent 
to the tapering of steroids in the subjects who received mepolizumab.

OLE HES Study 205203 
In Study 205203, the safety profile of mepolizumab 300 mg administered SC every 4 weeks for up to 
20 weeks (39.26 subject-years of exposure to mepolizumab) was similar to that observed in Study 
200622 (where mepolizumab 300 mg or placebo were administered SC every 4 weeks for up to 32 
weeks [32.51 subject-years of mepolizumab exposure]). No new safety issues were identified overall 
or by previous treatment group (previous placebo or previous mepolizumab) (Table 40). 
The overall incidence of AEs was 65%, and the SOC with the highest incidence of on-treatment AEs 
was Infections and Infestations (35%), followed by the Gastrointestinal Disorders SOC (22%). The 
most frequently reported on-treatment AE (occurring in >10% of subjects) was diarrhoea (12%) 
(Table 41). The maximum intensity of reported on-treatment AEs was mild for 18 (18%) subjects, 
moderate for 32 (31%) subjects, and severe for 12 (12%) subjects overall. The incidence of AEs 
considered to be drug-related by the investigator was 15%. One subject (Subject; previous placebo) 
reported a non-serious, drug-related AE of pain that was of severe intensity and led to withdrawal from 
the study. 
On-treatment AEs in the Haemorrhages SMQ for Study 205203 were reported for 4 of 102 subjects 
(4%). All of these AEs were non-serious, the majority of the events were of mild intensity and 
considered to be unrelated to study treatment by the investigator, and none led to discontinuation of 
study treatment.

In Study MHE100901, the incidence of on-treatment AEs was 97%, and the most frequently reported 
PTs were cough (33%), fatigue (31%), headache (29%), URTI (29%), and sinusitis (28%). AEs in the 
Infections and Infestations SOC were the most frequently reported (76%). In Study MHE100901, the 
incidence of on-treatment drug-related AEs was 26%, and the PTs reported in >1% of subjects were 
fatigue (8%), nausea (4%), arthralgia, pain in extremity, pruritis, and headache (3% each). 
Mepolizumab HES EAP 
Mepolizumab HES EAP was ongoing at the time of the safety cut-off date for this submission (01 June 
2020), with an iCSR cut-off date of 01 March 2019.  
As of the mepolizumab HES EAP iCSR safety cut-off date, most of the patients in the program were 
enrolled in MHE104317 (339). Patients enrolled in the MHE104317 program provided the majority of 
the safety data.   
In MHE104317, the incidence of on-treatment AEs was 91%, and the most frequently reported PTs 
were URTI (24%) and fatigue (22%). AEs in the Infections and Infestation SOC were the most 
frequently reported (71%). The incidence of on-treatment drug-related AEs in MHE104317 was 23%, 
and the most frequently reported (≥2% incidence) AEs were headache, fatigue, and nausea. One AE 
considered to be drug-related by the physician was fatal (multiple organ dysfunction syndrome).  
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Within the mepolizumab clinical development program, the following are considered AESIs: systemic 
(allergic [Type I hypersensitivity] and other systemic) reactions, local injection site reactions, 
infections (including potentially opportunistic), malignancies, and cardiac disorders including serious 
cardiac, vascular, and thromboembolic (CVT) events and serious ischemic events. 
The relative risk and risk difference for SAEs and AESIs for mepolizumab (all doses) compared with 
placebo in the HES Placebo Controlled Studies are shown in Table 42. Systemic reaction and local 
injection site reaction AESIs were explicitly collected via a targeted eCRF only in Study 200622, and 
therefore in Table 42 these events are summarized for Study 200622 only. For the AESIs of 
malignancies, serious CVT events and serious ischemic events, relevant PTs were identified based on 
MedDRA version 22.0. 
Infections were the most frequently reported AESIs in both treatment groups (53% in the placebo 
group and 68% in the mepolizumab all doses group). The incidence of on-treatment serious infections 
was 1.0% in the placebo group and 9.3% in the mepolizumab all doses group (Table 42 and  
Assessment report  
EMA/560938/2021

Figure 26). Cardiac Disorders were the next most frequent category of AESI in both treatment groups 
and were reported with a similar incidence in the placebo and mepolizumab groups (5.2% and 7.2%, 
respectively). The relative risk of AESIs was greater with mepolizumab for all AESI categories other 
than Neoplasms and Malignancies (0.99 for both) (Table 42); the wide CIs for the relative risks reflect 
the small number of subjects with these events.

Systemic Reactions 
Study 200622 
Systemic (allergic [Type I Hypersensitivity] and other systemic) Reactions were collected via targeted 
eCRF in Study 200622 only. On-treatment events considered by the investigator to represent systemic 
reactions were reported for 1 subject (1.9%) (mepolizumab group) (Table 42), and this event was 
classified by the investigator as other systemic reaction. There were no systemic hypersensitivity 
reactions, and no events of anaphylaxis in the mepolizumab group in this study. In the placebo group, 
2 SAEs of anaphylaxis were reported for a 15-year-old male subject with history of peanut allergy and 
anaphylaxis prior to enrolment. Both events were not considered to be drug-related by the investigator 
(considered possibly related to known peanut allergy), and both resolved. 
Study treatment was continued unchanged. 
Study MHE100185 
There were 2 subjects in Study MHE100185 (both on mepolizumab 750 mg IV) with hypersensitivity 
reactions. One subject reported pruritus and rash one day after the 1st dose of mepolizumab, which 
resolved spontaneously; this subject completed remaining infusions with no recurrence of symptoms. 
The other subject with prior history of skin swelling, erythema, rash and itching, reported pruritus, 
rash, and swollen lips twice during the study, which led to interruption of the angiotensin-converting 
enzyme inhibitor; the events resolved. There were no events of anaphylaxis in the mepolizumab all 
doses group in the HES Placebo Controlled Studies.

OLE HES Study 205203 
No events of anaphylaxis were reported. Three (3%) subjects reported events considered by the 
investigator to represent systemic reactions. Allergic (type I hypersensitivity) reactions were reported 
for 2 subjects (PTs: rash and urticaria) and other systemic reactions were reported for 2 subjects (PTs: 
fatigue and paresthesia). All events were non-serious and considered to be drug-related by the 
investigator; all but 1 event (PT: fatigue) resolved, and no events led to discontinuation of study 
treatment. 
Local Injection Site Reactions 
Study 200622 
Local Injection Site Reactions were collected via targeted eCRF in Study 200622 only. In Study 
200622, 2 subjects (4%) in the placebo group reported 10 events of local injection site reactions, and 
4 subjects (7%) in the mepolizumab 300 mg SC group reported 6 events of local injection site reaction 
(Table 43). Event characteristics were similar between the treatment groups. All events for both the 
placebo and mepolizumab group were non-serious, of mild intensity, resolved, considered to be drug-
related by the investigator, and did not lead to study treatment discontinuation.  
Table 43: On-Treatment Adverse Events Reported by the Investigator as Local Injection Site 
Reactions (Study 200622, Safety Population) 
Study MHE100185 
In Study MHE100185, where mepolizumab 750 mg or placebo were administered via IV infusion there 
were no reports of on-treatment AEs of local injection site reaction or administration site reaction 
OLE HES Study 205203 
Six (6%) subjects reported a total of 15 events considered by the investigator to represent local 
injection site reactions. All events were non-serious, 14 were of mild intensity and 1 was of moderate 
intensity, all were considered to be drug-related by the investigator, all events resolved, and none of 
the events led to discontinuation of study treatment. Symptoms reported by >1 subject were 
erythema/redness, itching/pruritus, and warm to touch. 
Infections 
The incidence of on-treatment AEs in the Infections and Infestations SOC in the HES Placebo 
Controlled Studies was higher in the mepolizumab group (68.0%) than the placebo group (53.1%); 
this imbalance is largely explained by the incidence of URTI (6% on placebo and 18% on 
mepolizumab). The most frequently reported PTs within this SOC overall were bronchitis, URTI, 
nasopharyngitis, and rhinitis. 
Since an SMQ for URTI is not available, URTI MedDRA HLT under High Level Group Term Infections-
pathogen unspecified was utilized to identify PTs related to PT URTI. The incidence of on-treatment AEs 
within the URTI MedDRA HLT was similar in the placebo group (39%) and mepolizumab all doses group 
Assessment report  
EMA/560938/2021  
Page 103/140 
 
 
 
 
 
(41%) (Table 44). Eight subjects on placebo and 13 subjects on the mepolizumab reported >1 event 
each. All AEs in the URTI HLT were non-serious, mild or moderate in intensity (except for 2 events of 
severe sinusitis, 1 in each treatment group; both in Study MHE100185), all but 3 AEs (reported for a 
single subject) were not considered to be drug-related by the investigator, and no event led to 
discontinuation of study treatment. 
Table 44: On-Treatment Adverse Events Within Upper Respiratory Tract Infection MedDRA 
High Level Term (HES Placebo Controlled Studies, Safety Population) 
Serious Infections 
The incidence of on-treatment SAEs in the Infections and Infestations was 9.3% (9 subjects) in the 
mepolizumab all doses group and 1.0% (1 subject) in the placebo group. No dose response was 
evident for the mepolizumab 300 mg SC and 750 mg IV groups (Table 42). 
No patterns with respect to the anatomical site of infection or the type of infection were observed in 
the mepolizumab all doses group; 7/9 subjects in the mepolizumab all doses group had a pre-existing 
condition or other factor which likely contributed to the development of infection. These were: HES 
flare (1 subject; fatal SAE of septic shock), known diverticulosis (1 subject; SAE of diverticulitis), 
history of Whipple procedure (1 subject; SAE of liver abscess), fall (2 subjects; SAE of erysipelas and 
bursitis infective), possible exposure to infectious source due to being a hospital worker (1 subject; 
SAE of pneumonia), and comorbid condition of asthma (1 subject, SAE of bronchitis). For the 2 
remaining subjects in the mepolizumab all doses group with serious infections of bronchitis and tooth 
infection, recovery was reported within the expected timeframe. All but 1 event (fatal septic shock) 
resolved with continued mepolizumab treatment and all were not considered to be drug-related by the 
investigator. 
The single subject with a serious infection of pneumonia in the placebo group also had a pre-existing 
condition that likely contributed to the development of infection (comorbid condition of asthma). 
To place the results of the HES Placebo Controlled Studies with respect to serious infections in context 
of the existing clinical safety data for mepolizumab, the incidence of on-treatment AEs and SAEs in the 
Infections and Infestations SOC was reviewed in the placebo-controlled studies in severe asthma, 
COPD, CRSwNP, and EGPA.  
Assessment report  
EMA/560938/2021  
Page 104/140 
 
 
 
 
In the severe asthma and COPD integrated placebo-controlled studies, the incidences of on-treatment 
AEs and SAEs in the Infections and Infestations SOC were similar between placebo and mepolizumab 
groups. In severe eosinophilic asthma the incidence of infections was 58% (239/412 subjects) in the 
integrated placebo group vs 57% (519/915 subjects) in the mepolizumab all doses group, and serious 
infections were reported for 3% of subjects in both the integrated placebo (14/412) and mepolizumab 
all doses (23/915). In severe COPD the incidence of infections was 53% (341/645 subjects) in the 
integrated placebo group and 51% (439/865 subjects) in the mepolizumab all doses group, and 
serious infections were reported for 9% of subjects in both the integrated placebo (60/645) and 
mepolizumab all doses (79/865) groups. In addition to lower doses, these studies used mepolizumab 
300 mg SC (COPD), and mepolizumab 250 mg IV and 750 mg IV (severe asthma), with no dose 
response evident in the severe asthma or COPD integrated placebo-controlled studies.  
In the integrated placebo-controlled studies in CRSwNP that evaluated mepolizumab 100mg SC dose 
and 750mg IV dose, the incidences of on-treatment AEs and SAEs in the Infections and Infestations 
SOC were similar between placebo and mepolizumab groups. The incidence of infections was 63% 
(160/253 subjects) in the integrated placebo group vs 54% (140/259 subjects) in the mepolizumab all 
doses group , and serious infections were reported for 2% (4/253 subjects) in the integrated placebo 
group and <1% (1/259 subjects) in the mepolizumab all doses group. 
In the placebo-controlled EGPA study that evaluated mepolizumab 300mg SC dose, the incidences of 
on
treatment AEs and SAEs in the Infections and Infestations SOC were similar between placebo and 
mepolizumab groups. The incidence of infections was 78% (53/68 subjects) in the placebo group vs 
‑
84% (57/68 subjects) in the mepolizumab group, and serious infections were reported for 15% (10/68 
subjects) in the placebo group and 6% (4/68 subjects) in the mepolizumab group. 
From the biological plausibility perspective, mepolizumab has not produced immunosuppression in 
animals or patients. There are literature publications using in vitro and in vivo murine model systems 
that appear to demonstrate a potential role for eosinophils in host immune defense of viral and/or 
bacterial infections, but these nonclinical observations have not translated to human experience with 
anti-IL-5 or anti-IL-5 receptor α (IL-5Rα) monoclonal antibody therapy [Gleich, 2013; Roufosse, 
2018]. 
In summary, considering the totality of the information, the imbalance in the serious infections in the 
HES Placebo Controlled Studies may be due to chance especially considering the small sample size 
relative to the larger sample sizes in severe asthma, COPD, and CRSwNP studies, and a causal 
relationship between mepolizumab and infections is unlikely. 
Potential Opportunistic Infections 
Since SMQs for opportunistic infections were not available at the time of the finalization of the 
reporting and analysis plan, expert opinion on what constitutes opportunistic infections in the setting of 
biological therapy [Winthrop, 2015] was considered as a reference for selecting PTs for events 
potentially representing opportunistic infections in Study 200622. This was also retrospectively applied 
to data from Study MHE100185. All PTs applicable to the list of pathogens and/or presentations of 
specific pathogens to be considered as opportunistic infections in the setting of biologic therapy by 
Winthrop et al were selected [Winthrop, 2015]. For PTs that were not specific enough to definitively 
match to the list of pathogens and/or presentations in the expert publication, a conservative approach 
was used, and a term was included. For example, while only invasive and/or pharyngeal candidiasis is 
considered to represent an opportunistic infection, non-specific terms like ‘candida infection’ or 
‘candida test’ were included. The incidence of on-treatment AEs identified as potentially representing 
opportunistic infections was 4% in the placebo group and 6% in the mepolizumab group (Table 45).

Table 45: Summary of On-Treatment Potential Opportunistic Infections (HES Placebo 
Controlled Studies, Safety Population) 
The reported events of oral herpes and herpes simplex are unlikely to represent an invasive disease 
based on being reported as non-serious, of mild intensity and verbatim terms suggestive of localized 
infection (e.g., cold sore). 
Events of herpes zoster (placebo), herpes virus infection (mepolizumab), and oesophageal candidiasis 
(mepolizumab) are considered to meet the criteria of opportunistic infection by Winthrop et al 
[Winthrop, 2015]. 
OLE HES Study 205203 
On-treatment AEs in the Infections and Infestations SOC were reported for 36 (35%) subjects, and 
SAEs in the Infections and Infestations SOC were reported for 5 (5%) subjects. The incidence of on-
treatment AEs in the URTI MedDRA HLT was 19%. Two (2%) subjects reported 1 event each of 
potential opportunistic infections (PTs: oral herpes and mycobacterium abscess infection). The event of 
mycobacterium abscessus infection was considered to meet the criteria for opportunistic infection 
[Winthrop, 2015].  
Malignancies 
The incidence of on-treatment AEs categorized as malignancies was 1% (1 subject) in both treatment 
groups: 1 subject with T-cell lymphoma (SAE) in the placebo group and 1 subject with basal cell 
carcinoma in the mepolizumab group.  
T-Cell Lymphoma 
Lymphocytic variant of HES (L-HES) is characterized by clonal expansion of immunophenotypically-
aberrant T-cells, and patients may develop or present concomitantly with T-cell lymphoma indicating 
that L-HES has malignant potential [Gleich, 2009; Shomali, 2019]. 
Given that both HES and T-cell lymphoma are rare, the risk of T-cell lymphoma in patients with L-HES 
is not quantified. One of the largest studies of patients with L-HES is by Lefevre et al who conducted a 
national multi-center retrospective study in the French Eosinophil network to describe characteristics 
and outcomes of L-HES patients. They identified 21 patients diagnosed with L-HES, one of whom 
developed T-cell lymphoma (angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma [AITL]) 8 years after HES diagnosis. 
The mean (± standard deviation) follow-up duration after HES diagnosis was 6.9 ±5.1 years in this 
Assessment report

study, which gives the incidence of T-cell lymphoma of 6.9 cases per 1000 patient-years [Lefevre, 
2014]. 
Rates of reported cases of lymphoma in the HES clinical program are presented in Table 46, and 
abbreviated narratives for the 19 cases (18 in the HES clinical program and 1 in the COPD clinical 
program) are provided in Section 8.1. As of 01 June 2020, 18 AEs of lymphoma were reported in the 
mepolizumab HES clinical program. One of these 18 cases was a non-serious event of lymphoma 
(verbatim: knee lymphoma) of mild intensity, reported in the mepolizumab HES EAP MHE104317 as 
resolved in 59 days; based on the verbatim term and resolution in 59 days this event is unlikely to 
represent lymphoma and therefore is not included in Table 46 below. 
Of the 17 remaining cases of lymphoma in the HES clinical program, 13 cases were reported in the 
mepolizumab HES EAP, 1 case was reported in Study 200622 (placebo group), 2 cases were reported 
in the completed OLE study MHE100901 , and 1 case was reported in the completed OLE study  
(Table 46). In the mepolizumab HES EAP, safety data for the Initial Compassionate Use Program and 
treatment protocol MHE112562 were not reported in the clinical database. Seven of the 13 cases 
reported in the mepolizumab HES EAP were also reported in the clinical database. 
One additional event of lymphoma was reported in the placebo arm in the COPD study MEA117106. As 
of 01 June 2020, no events of lymphoma have been reported in the severe eosinophilic asthma, EGPA, 
nasal polyposis, atopic dermatitis, and EoE clinical programs. Some of these programs included 
mepolizumab doses of 300 mg and higher: 300 mg SC in the EGPA program, 750 mg IV in the severe 
asthma study MEA112997 and 300 mg SC in the COPD study MEA115113. Importantly, the incidence 
of malignancies was similar for placebo and mepolizumab in the integrated placebo-controlled studies 
in severe eosinophilic asthma (placebo: 3/412 [<1%]; mepolizumab all doses: 2/915 [<1%]) and 
severe COPD (placebo: 13/645 [2%]; mepolizumab all doses: 16/865 [2%]). 
Of the 17 reports of lymphoma in the HES clinical program, duration of HES was reported for 14 cases, 
and ranged from less than a year to 15 years prior to enrolment into a clinical study or entering the 
HES EAP. Duration of HES was one year or less for 5 cases, between 1 and 5 years for 5 cases, and 
greater than 5 years for 4 cases. Five of the 17 cases of lymphoma in the HES program were 
diagnosed within the first 90 days of initiating mepolizumab/placebo, suggesting that in these 5 cases, 
it was likely a pre-existing condition. The remaining 12 subjects were diagnosed with lymphoma while 
receiving treatment with mepolizumab for longer than 90 days. Six of the 12 subjects were reported to 
have the L-HES variant, which increases the risk of T-cell lymphoma. One subject with unknown HES 
phenotype had concurrent immune deficiency and was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Another 
subject with unknown HES phenotype had suspected occult lymphoma since the time of HES diagnosis. 
One subject was considered by the treating physician to have secondary (reactive) HES due to long-
lasting undiagnosed epidermotropic T-cell indolent lymphoma.

(Studies 200622, MHE100185, 205203, MHE100901, and the HES EAP), Safety Population 
In summary, L-HES is associated with an increased risk of T-cell lymphoma, and therefore the 
incidence and characteristics of T-cell lymphoma were evaluated in the mepolizumab HES clinical 
program. 
The majority (13/17) of the cases of lymphoma in the HES clinical program were reported in the 
mepolizumab HES EAP, which also has the most subject-years of exposure compared with exposure in 
clinical studies. Exposure-adjusted incidences of lymphoma in the mepolizumab HES clinical program 
are similar to the estimate from the study by Lefevre et al [Lefevre, 2014]. 
As of 01 June 2020, there have been no reports of lymphoma in the mepolizumab clinical programs in 
severe eosinophilic asthma, COPD (except for 1 case on placebo), EGPA, nasal polyposis, atopic

dermatitis, and EoE. There is no known mechanism to link mepolizumab with potential for developing 
or accelerating malignancies. The incidence of malignancies was similar for mepolizumab and placebo 
in the integrated placebo-controlled studies in severe eosinophilic asthma and severe COPD. 
Serious Cardiac, Vascular, and Thromboembolic Events and Serious Ischemic Events 
The incidences of on-treatment AEs in the Cardiac Disorders SOC were similar for the placebo (5.2%) 
and mepolizumab all doses (7.2%) groups (Table 47). The incidences of on-treatment SAEs in the 
Cardiac Disorders SOC were also similar between the placebo group (1%) and the mepolizumab all 
doses group (2%). The incidence of AEs categorized as serious CVT events was 2% (2 subjects) in the 
placebo group and 3% (3 subjects) in the mepolizumab all doses group (Table 46). 
One subject (mepolizumab group) had a fatal cardiac arrest, described in the next section. No serious 
ischemic events were reported in the HES Placebo Controlled Studies (Table 47).

There were no serious CVT events reported. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The incidences of on-treatment SAEs in the HES Placebo Controlled Studies were similar between 
placebo (14%) and mepolizumab all doses (18%) groups (Table 48). The System Organ Class (SOC) 
with the highest incidence of on-treatment SAEs overall was Infections and Infestations: the incidences 
of SAEs in the Infections and Infestations SOC were 1% for the placebo group and 9% for 
mepolizumab all doses group. In the placebo group, the most frequently reported SOCs were Blood 
and Lymphatic System Disorders (3%), Neoplasms Benign, Malignant and Unspecified (Incl Cysts and 
Polyps) (2%), and Gastrointestinal Disorders (2%) (Table 48). On-treatment SAE PTs reported for >1 
subject overall were HES (1 fatal [mepolizumab group]), pneumonia (1 fatal [mepolizumab group]), 
asthma, bronchitis, and renal failure. No on-treatment SAEs were considered to be drug-related by the 
investigator.

the on-treatment SAEs was reported in more than 1 subject.

Deaths 
There were 2 deaths in the HES Placebo Controlled Studies, both in the mepolizumab group (1 on 300 
mg SC and 1 on 750 mg IV). 
One subject  (Study 200622), a 66-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension,  
hypercholesterolemia, congestive heart failure, and cardiomyopathy, on 09 January 2019, 1 day after 
receiving the 3rd dose of mepolizumab, had SAEs of HES flare, pneumonia, respiratory failure, and 
septic shock, all reported with fatal outcome. The investigator stated the HES flare did not respond to 
high doses of steroids. The subject was hospitalized on 13 January 2019 due to an HES flare and 
treated with high dose IV steroids and levofloxacin for intestinal infection. During hospitalization, the 
subject was diagnosed with oesophageal candidiasis, worsening of dyspnoea and oedema, and 
nosocomial pneumonia. The subject’s condition progressed to respiratory failure, requiring intubation 
on 02 February 2019. The subject later died. An autopsy was not performed. The events were not 
considered to be drug-related by the investigator. 
The second subject (Study MHE100185), an 18-year-old male, had a fatal SAE of cardiac arrest 110 
days after the 1st dose (26 days since the last dose), which was not considered to be drug-related by 
the investigator. This subject had 2 other on-treatment SAEs (pyrexia and renal failure), of which the 
renal failure was ongoing at the time of the cardiac arrest. This subject had severe HES with multiple 
cardiovascular complications. The subject’s past medical history included cardiovascular accident, deep 
vein thrombosis, cardiac arrest, defibrillator insertion, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarctions, 
seizures, and vena cava filter insertion. Medical conditions ongoing at the time of death included 
cardiomyopathy, Loeffler’s endocarditis, renal insufficiency, and systemic hypertension. Pre-treatment 
echocardiograms performed pre-treatment revealed a decline in left ventricular ejection fraction 
between Screening and Baseline. An external cardiologist assessed the on-treatment electrocardiogram 
(ECG) findings and indicated that there was a minimal change during the treatment period compared 
with 
Baseline including a progressive widening of the QRS duration compatible with right bundle branch 
block. An autopsy was not performed. The cause of death on the discharge summary was cardiac 
arrest due to dysrhythmia and failure of the internal pacemaker/defibrillator.  
OLE HES Study 205203 
No deaths were reported in Study 205203 
OLE HES Study MHE100901 
There were 4 deaths in this study: one subject with cardiac failure, sepsis, and multi-organ failure, one 
subject  with  aspiration  pneumonia  and  respiratory  failure,  one  subject  with  sudden  death,  and  one 
subject  with  AITL  and  cardiopulmonary  failure.  The  AITL  was  considered  to  be  drug-related  by  the 
investigator (T-cell lymphomas are described further above under AESI). 
Deaths (Mepolizumab HES EAP) 
The mepolizumab HES EAP was initiated to treat patients with severe HES that have organ- or life-
threatening disease that have not responded to multiple standard of care therapies and were often too 
unstable to enter placebo-controlled clinical studies. Combined with the long duration of treatment 
(median 3.0 years, ranging from 1 month to 16.75 years), patients in the mepolizumab HES EAP had 
more time to experience SAEs and fatal events than subjects in a typical clinical study of 1-year 
duration. There were total of 33 deaths reported in mepolizumab HES EAP. Of these, 25 were reported 
in MHE104317, 14 on-treatment and 11 during the follow-up period. The fatal SAE PTs (on- and post-
treatment) occurring in >1 patient were cardiac arrest (3 patients), respiratory failure (3 patients),

myocardial infarction (2 patients), multiple organ dysfunction (2 patients), cardio-respiratory arrest (2 
patients), and sepsis (2 patients). One fatal SAE (multiple organ dysfunction syndrome; on-treatment) 
was considered to be drug-related by the physician. 
The remaining 8 deaths were reported in the: 
• 
Initial Compassionate Use Program (3 patients): 1 paediatric patient with a fatal SAE of respiratory 
insufficiency; 1 patient with a fatal SAE of unexplained nasal Haemorrhage, and 1 patient with a fatal 
SAE of suicide; none of the events were considered to be drug-related by the physician. 
•  NPS  Guidance  Program  (3  patients):  1  patient  with  a  fatal  SAE  of  multiple  organ  dysfunction 
syndrome, 1 patient with a fatal SAE of pulmonary superinfection associated with septic shock (not 
drug-related),  and  1  patient  with  a  fatal  SAE  of  T-cell  lymphoma  (relationship  to  mepolizumab 
treatment unknown). T-cell lymphomas are described further above under AESIs. 
•  Treatment protocol MHE112562 (2 patients): 1 patient with a fatal SAE of septic shock and 1 patient 
with a fatal SAEs of sudden death, respiratory failure, and mechanical ventilation; none of the events 
were considered to be drug-related by the physician. 
All Studies Combined 
Table 49 presents the incidence of deaths in the All Studies Combined by dose and indication. The 
exposure-adjusted rate of death for the integrated placebo group was 20.9 per 1000 subject-years of 
exposure and for the mepolizumab all doses group was 10.3 per 1000 subject years of exposure.

Laboratory findings 
Clinical Chemistry 
There was no evidence of treatment effect on clinical chemistry parameters. For all post-Baseline 
clinical chemistry parameters in the HES Placebo Controlled Studies, the majority of subjects in each 
treatment group had values shift to the normal range or no change. The incidence of subjects with 
clinical chemistry parameter values outside the normal range at any time post-Baseline occurred with 
comparable incidence across the treatment groups (Table 50). The parameter with a ≥10% difference 
in incidence between placebo and mepolizumab groups was lactate dehydrogenase (to high in both 
treatment groups; higher in placebo).

In the HES Placebo Controlled Studies, there were no possible ‘Hy’s Law’ events (i.e., drug-induced 
liver injury with hyperbilirubinemia, defined as alanine aminotransferase [ALT] ≥3x upper limit of 
normal [ULN] and bilirubin ≥2xULN [>35% direct] [or ALT ≥3xULN and international normalized ratio 
[INR] >1.5, if INR measured]). Two subjects in the mepolizumab group (1 in Study 200622 [met the 
protocol-defined liver monitoring criteria, but not liver stopping criteria] and 1 in Study MHE100185 
[liver chemistry monitoring/ stopping criteria were not defined in this study]) had ALT ≥3x ULN. 
Hematology 
Laboratory parameters for haematology that were assessed in both Study 200622 and Study MHE100185 
were integrated. 
Blood eosinophil counts were considered a pharmacodynamics assessment in the HES Placebo 
Controlled Studies and are not described in this section. There was no evidence of treatment effect on 
haematology parameters (except for blood eosinophil counts). For most post-Baseline haematology 
parameters in the HES Placebo Controlled Studies, the majority of subjects in each treatment group 
had values shift to the normal range or no change. The incidence of subjects with haematology 
parameter values outside the normal range at any time post-baseline occurred with comparable 
incidence across the treatment groups (Table 51). Of the haematology parameters with subjects with 
worst case post-Baseline shifts outside the normal range, the parameters with a ≥10% higher in 
incidence in mepolizumab vs placebo were: lymphocytes (109/L) (to low), monocytes/leukocytes (%) 
(to high), segmented neutrophils/leukocytes (%) (to high), neutrophils/leukocytes (%) (to high); and 
parameters with a ≥10% higher in incidence in placebo vs mepolizumab were: leukocytes (109/L) (to 
high), monocytes (109/L) (to low), neutrophils (109/L) (to high), segmented neutrophils (109/L) (to 
high), neutrophils/leukocytes (%) (to low).

No  subjects  had  haematology  changes  from  Baseline  that  met  pre-defined  potential  clinical  concern 
values.

Vital Signs 
Mean values for systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure were similar between the placebo 
and mepolizumab all doses groups in the HES Placebo Controlled Studies. Mean values for pulse rate 
and temperature were also similar between the treatment groups. 
Electrocardiograms 
Different methods of ECG data collection were used in studies 200622 and MHE100185. No treatment 
related effects were noted for ECG parameters in both studies (Table 52).

Immunogenicity Results 
Immunogenicity in HES Placebo Controlled Studies 
Serum samples were assessed for immunogenicity using a tiered analysis approach with validated 
assays: i) for binding anti-drug antibody (ADA): screening, confirmation, and titration analysis; and ii) 
for neutralizing antibody (NAb). Studies 200622 and MHE100185 used different methods to detect 
binding ADAs (6th and 3rd generation assay, respectively) and NAbs (3rd and 2nd generation assay, 
respectively). Given the assay differences, a comparison between studies is not appropriate. Note that 
Study 200622 used the same binding ADA and NAb assays as the mepolizumab severe asthma clinical 
program. 
Study 200622 
Two subjects in the mepolizumab 300 mg SC group tested positive for ADAs. One subject (2%, 1/54) 
was positive for ADAs at Baseline only, and one subject (2%, 1/53) was positive for ADAs at any time 
post-baseline (at Week 32). For both subjects, the titer values were low (titer values: 4). Neither of 
the subjects were positive for NAbs. 
For the post-baseline ADA positive subject, there were 2 non-serious AEs of URTI on Days 45 and 132, 
neither of which were considered to be drug-related by the investigator. This subject’s blood eosinophil 
count was high at both Screening (14,500 cells/µL) and Day 1 (1450 cells/µL), this decreased up to 
Week 4, after which counts gradually increased to return to Baseline levels during the remainder of the 
study treatment period (2430 cells/µL at the end of study [Week 32]). The post-baseline ADA 
assessment for this subject in Study 205203 was negative. 
Study MHE100185 
Assessment report  
EMA/560938/2021  
Page 117/140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Post-baseline, 5 subjects tested positive for ADAs: 1 subject (1/41) in the placebo group (titer 4) and 4 
subjects (4/43) in the mepolizumab 750 mg IV group (range: <2 to 64). No subjects tested positive for 
NAbs. 
Of the 4 subjects in the mepolizumab group who had detectable ADAs post-baseline, 1 subject had a 
systemic reaction of hypersensitivity on Days 5, 35, and 78, and a fatal SAE of cardiac arrest (HES-
related; not drug-related) on Day 110. This subject had a progressive increase in blood eosinophils in 
the visits prior to the fatal event: 200 cells/µL on Day 1 (pre-dose), this decreased and remained 
stable up to Day 64, after which counts increased progressively to 2840 cells/µL on Day 107. One 
other subject in the mepolizumab group with ADAs had an increase in blood eosinophil count: 70 
cells/µL at Day 1 (pre-dose), this decreased up to Day 28 (10 cells/µL), after which counts increased 
to 980 cells/µL by Day 112, thereafter declining to 430 cells/µL at Day 224. The clinical significance of 
this finding remains unclear as the subject was noted to have an ADA titer of 32 at Day 168 but was 
simultaneously undergoing successful prednisone tapering. For the 2 other subjects on mepolizumab 
who tested positive for ADAs, there were small changes in blood eosinophil count for two Subjects and 
the reduction was maintained throughout the study. 
Immunogenicity in the Supportive HES Studies 
The incidence of immunogenicity following mepolizumab administration was low in Study 205203. One 
subject (previously receiving mepolizumab in Study 200622) who tested positive for ADA at baseline 
(which was also the Week 32 Visit of Study 200622) became negative at Week 20. No subjects had a 
confirmed positive ADA assay result at any time post-Baseline. This study used the same validated 
assays that also supported Study 200622. 
Immunogenicity was assessed in the completed OLE study MHE100901. This study utilized different 
binding ADA (4th generation) and NAb (3rd generation) assays, and 57% of subjects (39/69) 
confirmed positive for ADAs (range of titre values: 5 to 1600). No subjects tested positive for NAbs. 
The different immunogenicity incidences are most likely due to the various assay formats. The 3rd 
generation ADA assay (used with Study MHE100185 samples) utilized the Bioveris platform (reagents 
and plate reader); which became unavailable following its purchase. The 4th generation ADA assays 
(used with Study MHE100901 samples) utilized a platform from MesoScale Discovery (bridging assay 
with electro-chemiluminescent detection). This assay format was susceptible to false positive ADA 
responses due to the homodimer target (i.e., IL-5) binding the drug conjugates. The inclusion of an 
anti-IL-5 blocking antibody to mitigate target interference (6th generation ADA assay [used with study 
samples from 200622 and 205203, and in the severe asthma clinical program]) reduced the false 
positive assay responses from IL-5. 
Safety in special populations 
Adverse Events by Age 
Of the HES Placebo Controlled Studies, only Study 200622 enrolled adolescent subjects (ages 12 to 17 
years). In Study 200622, there were 4 adolescent subjects (ages 12 to 17 years), 3 in the placebo 
group and 1 in the mepolizumab group. Two subjects in the placebo group had an on-treatment AE. No 
AE PTs in this age group were reported for >1 subject. One of the subjects in the placebo group had an 
ontreatment SAE of anaphylactic reaction. No on-treatment AEs were reported for the adolescent 
subject in the mepolizumab group. 
In the HES Placebo Controlled Studies, the majority of subjects in both the placebo and mepolizumab 
groups were aged 18 to 64 years (Table 36). The incidence of on-treatment AEs in this age group was 
Assessment report  
EMA/560938/2021  
Page 118/140 
 
 
 
similar to that observed in the Safety Population (92% in both treatment groups); the most frequently 
reported SOC and PTs reflected that of the Safety Population. 
Given the low proportion of the Safety Population that was aged ≥65 years (18% [17/96 subjects] in 
the placebo group and 12% [12/97 subjects] in mepolizumab all doses group), there is a limited ability 
to compare the incidence and pattern of on-treatment AEs this subgroup to the Safety Population. 
Adverse Events by Gender 
The incidence of on-treatment AEs and the incidence of the most frequently reported SOC and PTs 
were similar in the female and male subgroups and reflected that observed in the Safety Population. 
Adverse Events by Race 
Most subjects in the Safety Population were White (90%) (Table 36). Amongst White subjects, the 
incidence of on-treatment AEs and the incidence of the most frequently reported SOC and PTs were 
similar to that observed in the Safety Population. Given the low proportion of subjects in the Safety 
Population who were of African American/African Heritage (5%) or Asian (3%) (Table 36), there is a 
limited ability to compare the incidence and pattern of on-treatment AEs these subgroups to the Safety 
Population. 
Extrinsic Factors 
Safety was not summarized by extrinsic factor. 
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
During the conduct of the mepolizumab clinical development program, female subjects were required 
to commit to consistent and correct use of an acceptable method of birth control (defined as failure 
rate of <1%) from the time of consent, for the duration of the study, and for 4 months after the last 
dose of study drug administration. As of 23 September 2019 (cut-off date for current Investigator’s 
Brochure), 33 pregnancies were reported for 31 female subjects receiving investigational product in 
the completed and ongoing mepolizumab studies (all indications) (Table 53). Of the 33 pregnancies, 2 
were reported in subjects who received placebo. There was one report of congenital anomalies for the 
live births (see description below). Two additional pregnancies were reported for the female partners of 
study subjects: 1 on placebo which resulted in a spontaneous abortion (Study SB-240563/035), 1 on 
mepolizumab 100 mg SC which resulted in live birth with congenital anomaly (study 201312). These 
exposures via partner cases are not included in Table 53.

Table 53: Reported Pregnancies in the Mepolizumab Clinical Development Program 
(Completed and Ongoing GSK-Sponsored Studies and Expanded Access Program; Status as 
of 23 September 2019) 
Two studies, 201810 and 205687, have been completed and unblinded. The live birth of a healthy 
neonate in Study 201810 (Table 53) was reported for a female subject who was randomized to 
continued mepolizumab 100 mg SC in Part C of the study. The live birth with congenital anomalies of 
low haemoglobin, mild pulmonary valve stenosis, and heart murmur in Study 205687 (Table 53) was 
reported for a female subject who received mepolizumab 100 mg SC. The pregnancy was confirmed 
after the 4th dose of mepolizumab, and study treatment was discontinued. Another female subject in 
Study 205687 (Table 53), who was randomized to receive placebo, reported a missed abortion 41 
days after her first dose of placebo and was withdrawn from the study. 
Overdose 
The dose of mepolizumab considered to be an overdose has not been defined. Single doses of up to 
1500 mg have been administered IV without evidence of dose-related toxicities. There are no known 
antidotes and the MAH does not recommend a specific treatment in the event of a suspected overdose. 
Clinical judgment should be used in treating the symptoms of a suspected overdose. 
Drug Abuse 
There is no evidence for and no anticipation of patient abuse of mepolizumab. 
Withdrawal and Rebound 
In the HES Placebo Controlled Studies, the incidences of post-treatment AEs were similar between the 
mepolizumab and placebo groups. There were no verbatim reports of ‘rebound’ of disease. 
Subjects completing Study MHE100185 were eligible to enroll in Study MHE100901. Subjects 
continuing mepolizumab treatment in Study MHE100901 had no treatment break, that is, subjects 
received the first dose of mepolizumab in Study MHE100901 within 28 days of receiving the last dose 
in Study MHE100185. Likewise, subjects completing Study 200622 were eligible to enroll in Study 
205203, and those continuing mepolizumab treatment in Study 205203 were not to have a treatment 
break. Due to study design, it has not been possible to assess rebound in these studies. There was no 
evidence of rebound in the clinical program in severe asthma, EGPA, and CRSwNP.

Effects on Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery or Impairment of Mental Ability 
There have been no studies to investigate the effect of mepolizumab on driving performance or the 
ability to operate machinery. A detrimental effect on such activities would not be anticipated from the 
pharmacology or adverse reaction profile of mepolizumab. 
Discontinuation or Withdrawal from study 
Of the 193 subjects in the Safety Population of the HES Placebo Controlled Studies, 155 (80%) were 
considered study completers (Table 54); fewer subjects in the placebo group completed the studies 
(70%) compared with the mepolizumab group (91%). This is explained by the higher proportion of 
subjects withdrawing from the placebo group (50%) due to lack of efficacy (12% in the mepolizumab 
group) in Study MHE100185. In Study MHE100185, blood eosinophil counts were not blinded, and 
investigators were permitted to withdraw subjects from the study if they did not respond to treatment, 
in order for them to commence treatment with mepolizumab in OLE study MHE100901. In Study 
MHE100185, subjects discontinuing study treatment were withdrawn from the study, whereas in Study 
200622, subjects discontinuing study treatment were encouraged to continue in the study. In the HES 
Placebo Controlled Studies, there were 2 subjects who discontinued study treatment and did not 
withdraw from the study (1 on placebo and 1 on mepolizumab 300 mg SC, both in Study 200622, and 
the reason for withdrawal from treatment for both was ‘withdrawal by subject’). 
Of the 108 subjects randomized into Study 200622, a total of 102 subjects were enrolled and received 
treatment in Study 205203; 52 subjects previously received placebo and 50 subjects previously 
received mepolizumab in Study 200622.

Table 54: Summary of Subject Disposition by Dose (HES Placebo Controlled Studies, Safety 
Population) 
The incidence of AEs that led to permanent discontinuation of study treatment or withdrawal from the 
HES Placebo Controlled Studies was 6% in the placebo group and 2% in the mepolizumab group 
(Table 54). The PT occurring in >1 subject overall was HES. For 6 subjects, these events were SAEs: 
2 subjects in the mepolizumab group (1 subject with fatal SAEs of HES, pneumonia, respiratory failure, 
and septic shock, and 1 subject with fatal SAE of cardiac arrest), and 4 in the placebo group (1 subject 
with T-cell lymphoma, 1 subject with lung neoplasm malignant, 1 subject with nephrotic syndrome, 
and 1 subject with eosinophilia and polyneuropathy). The lung neoplasm malignant event occurred 
pre-treatment. None of the AEs leading to treatment discontinuation or study withdrawal were 
considered to be drug-related by the investigator.

Treatment or Withdrawal from the Study (HES Placebo Controlled Studies, Safety 
Population) 
OLE HES Study 205203 
The incidence of AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study treatment and/or withdrawal from 
the study was <1%. One subject discontinued study treatment and withdrew from the study due to an 
AE (PT: pain). The event was of severe intensity, was considered to be drug-related by the 
investigator, and the event was recovered/resolved. 
OLE HES Study MHE100901  
There were 10 subjects who withdrew from the study due to an on-treatment AE (including 4 subjects 
due to a fatal event). No AE PTs were reported for >1 subject. For 7 subjects, the event was an SAE (4 
fatal and 3 non-fatal [transverse myelitis, disease progression, and hypotension]). For 2 subjects, the 
AE that led to study withdrawal was considered to be drug-related by the investigator (1 subject with 
transverse myelitis [SAE] and 1 subject with urticaria).  
EAP (MHE104317) 
All patients who discontinued treatment with mepolizumab were to have phone call follow-up 12 weeks 
after the last dose and were withdrawn from the program. In MHE104317, 35 patients (11%) 
discontinued mepolizumab treatment/withdrew from the program due to an on-treatment AE, and the 
PTs reported for ≥2 patients were angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, central nervous system 
vasculitis, dyspnea, lymphoma, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, nausea, and respiratory failure 
(2 patients each).

Post marketing experience 
A summary of safety data from post-marketing sources, together with results of a full review of the 
literature, is presented in the European Union (EU) Periodic Safety Update Reports (EU-PSUR) provided 
to regulatory agencies on a regular basis. The most recent /EU-PSUR has a cut-off date of 23 
September 2019. 
As of the cut-off date for the most recent EU-PSUR, NUCALA is approved in the United States of 
America (US), all EU Member States, Japan, and over 20 further countries for use in patients with 
severe eosinophilic asthma, and for the treatment of patients with EGPA in the US, Japan as well as 
other countries. The cumulative exposure to NUCALA in the post-marketing setting is estimated to be 
76,383 patient-years. 
The safety profile of mepolizumab from post-marketing sources remains generally similar to that 
known at initial market authorization. During the post-marketing period, following a review of 
spontaneous post marketing reports of anaphylaxis, the mepolizumab label was updated to include 
“anaphylaxis” in the existing Warning regarding hypersensitivity reactions and in the Adverse 
Reactions section. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Duration of exposure in the main safety study 200622 was similar across treatment groups (mean 7.2 
months). However, in study MHE100185, mepolizumab treated subjects received treatment for 
substantially longer than placebo patients (mean 7.6 months versus 5.2 months), largely due to an 
increased rate of withdrawals due to lack of efficacy in the placebo arm (placebo group 50%, 
mepolizumab group 12%).  
As per the iCSR for the EAP programmes, the mean s.c. dose and duration of treatment for 
MHE104317 was 751.1mg and 53.5 months and for the NPS Guidance Program (MHE112562 and 
112000) was 925.7mg and 16.6 months.  
The demographics across treatment arms was generally well balanced except for the % of elderly (≥65 
years) in study 200622 (placebo 19%, mepolizumab group 7%). Overall, the number of elderly 
patients treated with mepolizumab is low (n= 12) and no conclusion can be drawn in this population. 
The overall incidence and % of HES patients that experienced any AE was similar across all main 
studies, 91% and 92% in mepolizumab and placebo treatment arms respectively. The most common 
AEs were headache, fatigue and pruritus which occurred at a similar frequency across both treatment 
arms. For the controlled HES studies, most of the AEs were mild to moderate in severity.   
The SOC with the highest incidence of on-treatment AEs in both treatment groups was Infections and 
Infestations, the incidence was 53% in the placebo group and 68% in the mepolizumab all doses 
group, this imbalance was driven, in part, by an increased incidence of URTI (upper respiratory tract 
infection) in the mepolizumab group (18%) vs the placebo group (6%). The majority of URTI cases 
were non-serious, mild or moderate in intensity.  
Across both studies, there were a number of individual AEs where the CMH adjusted relative risk was 
>2 in the mepolizumab all doses group compared with the placebo group. These were Musculoskeletal 
chest pain, 4.92, Palpitations, 3.93, Pruritus generalised, 2.98, Oedema peripheral, 2.95, Tooth 
abscess, 2.94, Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) 2.79 and Constipation, 2.47.  The MAHs 
rationale that while there were numerical differences in the incidences of AEs observed between 
mepolizumab all doses and placebo in the HES placebo-controlled studies, the sample size in the HES 
Assessment report  
EMA/560938/2021  
Page 124/140 
 
 
 
studies was relatively small, and 95% confidence intervals for the CMH adjusted relative risks were 
wide and included 1.0 for all events except for the event of upper respiratory tract infection. For the 
event of upper respiratory tract infection, MedDRA HLT under High Level Group Term Infections-
pathogen unspecified was utilized to identify terms related to upper respiratory tract infection in the 
integrated placebo-controlled HES studies and it can be accepted that when these wider terms are 
included, the incidence of AEs linked to upper respiratory tract infections were similar across both 
treatment groups. 
In Study 200622, the number of Haemorrhages was increased for mepolizumab compared to the 
placebo treatment arm, 7 versus 19% (SMQ). In study 205203 (OLE to 200622), the incidences of AEs 
in the Haemorrhages SMQ were 4%. The MAH provided a discussion regarding this imbalance including 
that these events were mild or moderate in intensity, resolved, and were not considered to be drug-
related by the investigators. Almost half of the cases in mepolizumab treated patients were 
confounded by concomitant medications that could increase the risk of bleeding. There was no 
evidence of an imbalance in other clinical trial indications and no known mechanism for anti-IL-5 
effects on bleeding potential. The analysis of data from other indications did not point at divergency 
between the mepolizumab and placebo group or evidence of dose-response relationship.  
Across both controlled studies, the level of adverse reactions was 20% in the placebo group and 29% 
in the mepolizumab group. Fatigue, injection site reaction, arthralgia, myalgia and headache were the 
most common adverse reactions to occur. Of these, headache and injection site reaction are expected 
as per the Nucala SmPC with a frequency of very common, while fatigue, arthralgia and myalgia did 
not occur in mepolizumab treated patients in the pivotal study with the proposed licenced HES 
posology. Therefore, no new safety concerns are raised for the adverse reactions.  
Study 205203 which is an OLE extension of study 200622 demonstrated a comparable and more 
favourable safety profile to that observed in mepolizumab treated patients in study 200622. The 
overall percentage of AEs following 300mg s.c. mepolizumab in study 205203 was lower at 77% and 
52% for patients previously on placebo and mepolizumab arms compared with 89% in study 200622.  
Study MHE100901 which is an OLE extension of study MHE100185 demonstrated a comparable safety 
profile to that observed in mepolizumab treated patients in study MHE100185. The overall percentage 
of AEs following 750mg i.v. mepolizumab in study MHE100901 was 97% compared with 93% in study 
MHE100185.  
Similar safety trends were observed for the EAP study for AEs, although the varying doses and route of 
administration limit the interpretation of this data 
AESI include systemic reactions, local injection site reactions, infections, malignancies, and 
cardiovascular safety events.  
Systemic reactions occurred in n=3 mepolizumab-treated participants and n=2 placebo patients in the 
across the main controlled studies (including n=1 mepolizumab-treated participant in pivotal study 
200622). No cases of anaphylaxis occurred in mepolizumab treated patients. This is in line with 
hypersensitivity reactions being listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC with a frequency of common, while 
systemic reactions are considered an important identified risk in the RMP and subject to routine risk 
minimisation procedures. In addition, a targeted follow-up questionnaire is used to collect data on 
severe hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis. The following text is proposed to be added to the SmPC and is 
accepted “In the 32-week placebo-controlled study, no systemic allergic (type I hypersensitivity) 
reactions were reported. Other systemic reactions were reported by 1 subject (2%) in the group 
receiving 300 mg of mepolizumab (multifocal skin reaction) and no patients in the placebo group”.

Injection site reactions occurred with a higher frequency in mepolizumab-treated participants, with a 
RR of 2.0. This is in line with Injection site reactions being listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC with a 
frequency of common. All events were non-serious, of mild intensity and resolved and plausibly related 
to the method of administration. The following text is proposed to be added to the SmPC which is 
accepted “In the placebo-controlled study, injection site reactions (e.g., burning, itching) occurred at a 
rate of 7% in patients receiving 300 mg of mepolizumab compared with 4% in patients receiving 
placebo.” 
Infections and serious infections occurred with a higher frequency in mepolizumab-treated participants, 
with a RR of 1.28 and 8.87 respectively across controlled studies. 9% of mepolizumab patients 
compared to 1% of placebo patients experienced an SAE in the SOC of Infections and Infestations. 
There was a small number of opportunistic infections, and a fatality. The frequency of serious 
infections in OLE 205203 was 5%. The increased relative risk for serious infections has not been 
observed in other indications and there is no pattern in the type of infections that occurred. While an 
increased risk of infections may be a plausible mechanism of action based on the immunosuppressive 
nature of the active, generally mepolizumab does not appear to have produced immunosuppression in 
animals or patients thus far. As a result, the MAH considers this result may be a chance result, which 
could be agreed.  
Malignancies occurred at a similar frequency in both mepolizumab and placebo-treated participants in 
the main studies, with a RR of 0.99. However, across the HES development programme there were 18 
cases of lymphoma, compared to a total of 19 cases of lymphoma across the whole development 
programme (1 case in COPD, placebo). Of these 18 HES lymphomas, 1 occurred in a placebo treated 
patient, of the 17 cases in mepolizumab treated HES patients: 1 case was non-serious, resolved within 
2 months and was possibly not a lymphoma and 4 cases occurred within 90 days of initiating 
mepolizumab treatment and therefore were likely to be pre-existing. Of the remaining 12 HES 
lymphomas, half occurred in L-HES, this variant is known to be associated with an increased risk of 
developing lymphomas. 10 of these 18 lymphomas also occurred in patients receiving 700-750mg IV 
dose which is not the to be marketed posology. 
Two of the cases in HES patients were fatal (AITL, related, OLE Study MHE100901, and T-cell 
lymphoma, unknown relatedness, NPS Guidance program). In addition, a further 4 cases were 
considered to be related, possibly related or had unknown relatedness (study MHE104317). The 
association between the reported lymphoma cases and mepolizumab cannot be clearly excluded based 
on available data showing the onset of number of lymphoma cases in HES EAS population treated with 
mepolizumab. While HES is associated with an increased risk of lymphomas, due to the rarity of HES it 
is hard to quantify or estimate the incidence of lymphomas in HES. Alterations in immune response 
(malignancies) is an important potential risk.,  This risk is subject to routine risk minimisation 
procedures only and not subject to any additional monitoring which is accepted.  
Cardiac, Vascular, Thromboembolic and Ischemic Events occurred at a higher frequency in 
mepolizumab-treated participants than placebo patients. Alterations in cardiovascular safety is an 
important potential risk in the RMP, subject to routine risk minimisation procedures. In addition, 
targeted follow-up questionnaires are employed to collect data on MI/Unstable Angina, Cerebral 
Vascular Accident/Transient Ischemic Attack, Deep Vein Thrombosis/Pulmonary Embolism and 
Peripheral Arterial Thromboembolism. Therefore, no further action is anticipated. 
The level of on-treatment SAEs in the Controlled Studies was higher in the mepolizumab treated 
patients than in the placebo treated patients (18% versus 14%). Much of this difference is accounted 
for based on the imbalance in the numbers of serious infections across the treatment arms as the SOC 
Infections and infestations accounts for the highest number of SAEs in both main studies. .In addition, 
Assessment report  
EMA/560938/2021  
Page 126/140 
 
 
 
the increased incidence of SAEs in MHE100185 may partly be explained by the increased duration of 
treatment in the mepolizumab compared to the placebo arm (27.27 versus 18.23 subject-years). 
The numbers of SAEs in other SOCs were low and comparable across both treatment arms. The level 
of SAEs was 8% in the OLE study 205203, 51% in the OLE study MHE100901, and was 52% in the 
OLE main EAP study MHE104317. The higher rate of SAEs in MHE100901 and EAP may be attributable 
to the increased duration of treatment compared to the controlled studies. For EAP MHE104317 the 
higher rate of SAEs may also be due to the EAP patients having a more severe and organ and life-
threatening disease compared to the controlled and OLE studies.  
Two fatalities occurred in the controlled HES studies, both of these occurred in the mepolizumab 
treatment arms, 1 occurred with the to be licenced HES posology. Neither was considered related to 
mepolizumab by the investigator. Both subjects had several cardiovascular comorbidities. There were 
four fatalities in the OLE studies, all of these occurred in study MHE100901, (4/78, 5%) with the 
higher dose of i.v. mepolizumab, 1 of these was considered drug related by the investigator (AITL, 
MHE100901). There were no fatalities in OLE study 205203. The low number of HES patients in the 
controlled studies with the to be marketed HES dose and route of administration limits the overall 
assessment of the risk of HES fatalities.  
There was a substantial number of fatalities in the EAP studies (n=33). Patients in the EAP had severe 
HES and organ- or life-threatening disease that have not responded to multiple standard of care 
therapies and were often too unstable to enter placebo-controlled clinical studies. Patients were 
excluded from the clinical trials if they had life-threatening HES or HES co-morbidities. The EAP 
patients therefore represented a higher risk than HES patients recruited in the controlled and OLE 
clinical trials.   
Of these 33 EAP fatalities, 1 was considered related to drug treatment (multiple organ dysfunction 
syndrome), one had unknown relatedness (T-cell lymphoma), while the others were not considered 
drug related by the investigator. The majority of these patients were treated with higher i.v. doses of 
mepolizumab than is proposed for the licenced posology in HES, and for a longer duration than in the 
controlled studies. 
Of the 3 fatalities that were considered by investigators to be related, possibly related, or unknown 
relatedness, the lymphoma fatalities (n=2) are discussed and queried elsewhere. For the related 
fatality multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, the MAH has clarified the patient was treated with 
750mg i.v. mepolizumab and not the to be marketed lower HES posology.  
As HES is a rare disease, data on fatality rates are limited, the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma 
& Immunology suggest more than 80% of HES patients survive five years or more. Following 
queries, the MAH also provided estimated background incidence rates from literature reports for 
mortality in HES patients of 8 – 15%. This is compares favourably with the 7% fatality rate for the 
mepolizumab HES clinical programme.  
For the majority of chemistry and haematological laboratory results, there was no evidence of 
treatment effect. Although there was evidence of differences in a number of laboratory results 
changing from baseline to low or high values between the different treatment arms, most of these 
changes were not considered clinically significant.  
Mean values for vital signs were similar to baseline throughout the course of HES studies for both 
placebo and mepolizumab all doses groups, with the majority of patients having results in the normal 
ranges. Similarly, for ECG and QT measurements, mean values were comparable between treatment 
group and majority of results within normal ranges.

Immunogenicity with mepolizumab in HES patients was low at 2% in the pivotal 200622 study. This is 
in line with the low (although slightly higher) level of immunogenicity seen in severe asthma patients. 
No neutralising antibodies were detected in any patient that tested positive for ADAs. The SmPC has 
been updated accordingly. 
Different assays were used for OLE study MHE100185 which resulted in a high false positive rate, 
however the immunogenicity results for this study are less relevant as it is a supportive study 
Mepolizumab is not indicated for paediatric or adolescent HES patients. However, study 200622 
enrolled 4 adolescent patients, only 1 of which received Mepolizumab, this patient did not experience 
any AEs.  
It is noted that paediatric and adolescent patients (n = 24) were included in the EAP programme for 
HES, however this data is uncontrolled, the majority of these patients had higher doses than the 
proposed HES posology. In addition, there were 5 fatalities (21%) in this group.   
There was a low number of elderly (≥65 years) (n= 12), African American/African Heritage (5%) or 
Asian (3%) HES patients treated with mepolizumab limiting safety analysis in these sub-groups. There 
are no restrictions for the elderly or based on race in the SmPC and this is accepted.   
No formal studies have been performed on renal and hepatic impairment, however based on 
population pharmacokinetic analyses no dose adjustment is required in patients with creatinine 
clearance values between 50-80 mL/min, while changes in hepatic function are unlikely to have any 
effect on the elimination of mepolizumab due to mepolizumab being degraded by widely distributed 
proteolytic enzymes, not restricted to hepatic tissue. Renal and hepatic impairment have not been 
discussed by the MAH in relation to HES patients, however no differences are anticipated in these 
patients. 
The numbers of pregnancies in mepolizumab treated clinical trial subjects is low (n=33) and as per the 
SmPC use in pregnancy should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than 
any possible risk to the foetus. 
No concerns are raised regarding the potential for overdose, drug abuse, the ability to operate 
machinery or to drive. This is reflected in the current SmPC, no changes are warranted. 
The levels of discontinuations, treatment interruptions and withdrawals due to AEs was low across both 
treatment groups for the pivotal study 200622. However as previously referred to, for study 
MHE100185 the rate of withdrawals for placebo patients was significantly higher than for mepolizumab 
patients, resulting in different levels of exposure between both treatment arms in this trial. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall,  the  safety  profile  of  mepolizumab  in  HES  patients  is  largely  consistent  with  what  is  already 
known about mepolizumab in other indications.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
Nucala is being approved for Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA), Hypereosinophilic 
Syndrome (HES) and Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps (CRSwNP) indications concomitantly. As 
data in patients are limited, the safety profile in EGPA remains to be further characterised in the post 
marketing setting and will need to be closely monitored. Therefore, the PRAC/CHMP considers that an 
increase in PSUR frequency is warranted to monitor adequately the safety profile of mepolizumab in 
the new patients populations, mainly for the indication EPGA. The PSUR frequency is therefore 
Assessment report  
EMA/560938/2021  
Page 128/140 
 
 
 
increased to 6 monthly basis. The MAH should plan at least a further 6-month DLP period after the 
next December 2021 submission. 
Based on the above considerations, the CHMP is of the opinion that the already existing entry in the 
EURD list for mepolizumab needs to be amended as follows: the PSUR cycle for the medicinal product 
should follow a half-yearly cycle. The next data lock point will be 23 September 2021.

section 6.6 of the SmPC. 
User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
limited changes introduced in the proposed PI. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
HES is a group of rare hematologic disorders without a known cause in which eosinophils are 
overproduced in the bone marrow for prolonged periods of time. The sustained overproduction of 
eosinophils in the bone marrow results in high blood eosinophil levels (eosinophilia). When activated 
eosinophils from the bloodstream infiltrate various tissues, they cause inflammatory tissue damage 
and dysfunction. 
Inadequate HES treatment can lead to profound end-organ damage and increased mortality. 
The International Cooperative Working Group on Eosinophil Disorders (ICOG-EO) uses the following 
definition for HES: (1) blood eosinophilia of >1500 eosinophils/μL on 2 examinations (at an interval ≥1 
month, except in case of life-threatening organ-damage when diagnosis can be made immediately) 
and/or tissue eosinophilia; (2) organ damage and/or dysfunction attributable to tissue eosinophilia; 
and (3) exclusion of other disorders or conditions as the major reason for organ damage [Valent, 
2012b; Kahn, 2017]. HES is only diagnosed when organ damage and/or dysfunction are present. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Important goals of HES therapy are to decrease symptoms and blood eosinophil levels in order to 
achieve disease control. The current approach is based on reduction of blood eosinophilia, reduction of 
active inflammation, suppression of the immune response, and treatment of disease-specific and/or 
treatment-related complications. 
Standard of care (SoC) therapy for patients with HES includes corticosteroids (for F/P negative or F/P 
positive with cardiac involvement at diagnosis) or imatinib (for F/P positive) as first-line therapy and 
cytotoxics (e.g., hydroxyurea, cyclophosphamide) or immunomodulators (interferon alpha [INF
], 
Assessment report  
EMA/560938/2021  
𝛼𝛼
Page 132/140 
 
 
 
cyclosporine, immunoglobulin) as second-line agents [Roufosse, 2010]. Clinical responses to these 
therapies, however, are incomplete or inadequate in over 80% of HES patients (among those negative 
for F/P mutation). 
The discovery of the F/P mutation in patients with M-HES and its response to imatinib has improved 
survival and QoL in this subpopulation [Klion, 2009; Wechsler, 2012]. For most patients however, the 
only currently available treatment options are limited to chronic high doses of corticosteroids, IFN, and 
cytotoxic agents such as hydroxyurea and cyclophosphamide. The efficacy of these agents, even in 
combination, is not always adequate and side effects from long-term use are significant.  
Although not approved for use in HES, corticosteroids are used in clinical practice as first-line 
treatment for most patients with HES due to lack of available options [Ogbogu, 2009; Helbig, 2010]. 
The therapeutic strategy is to start with a moderate to high dose (≥40 mg/day prednisone or 
equivalent) and taper very slowly while monitoring the blood eosinophil count closely. Using this 
approach, most patients (85%, N=141) will respond initially to steroid therapy based on a decrease of 
blood eosinophil count to normal range and symptomatic improvement. However, many HES patients 
(72%, N=179) will need to be maintained on low steroid doses (median 10 mg/day) for long periods of 
up to 20 years since discontinuation of corticosteroids leads to eosinophilia and symptomatic 
recurrence in most patients [Klion, 2009; Ogbogu, 2009; Helbig, 2010]. 
Although the initial response to corticosteroid treatment is often positive, long-term use of oral 
corticosteroids (OCS) is associated with significant and commonly reported side effects, including 
truncal obesity, moon facies, buffalo hump, increased blood pressure, water retention, decreased bone 
density, weight gain, muscle atrophy, hyperglycemia, delayed wound healing, cataracts and glaucoma, 
peptic ulcers, and increased risk of infection [Poetker, 2010]. Therefore, with chronic use, the toxicities 
of steroid therapy become more significant, patient adherence diminishes, and additional or alternative 
corticosteroid-sparing therapies must be used [Roufosse, 2013]. The chronic use of corticosteroids is 
often discontinued (42%, N=179) or used in combination therapy (33%, N=179) due to toxicity or 
failure in the majority of HES patients [Ogbogu, 2009]. 
In the absence of approved targeted therapies for HES, several of the second-line agents 
(chemotherapeutic agents such as hydroxyurea, IFNα, and other cytotoxics [e.g., cyclosporine, 
vincristine, methotrexate, and busulfan]) have been used based on empirical observational evidence of 
benefit. These second-line agents are effective (defined as a decrease of eosinophil count and 
symptomatic improvement) only in a small number of HES patients, are associated with significant 
toxicities, have a slow onset of therapeutic effect, and confer an increased risk of patients developing 
malignancy. For example, the most commonly used second-line agent, hydroxyurea, is rarely useful as 
a single agent and its side effects and lack of efficacy result in discontinuation in the majority of 
patients (77%, N=64) [Ogbogu, 2009]. 
Despite significant advances in the understanding and management of HES, there remains the need for 
effective, well-tolerated treatments to control the disease and minimize the toxicities from chronic use 
of corticosteroids and second-line agents. This unmet medical need persists in particular for F/P 
negative HES, which comprises the majority (85%) of the HES patient population, due to the absence 
of a highly effective, well-tolerated therapy suitable for long-term use. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The applicant submitted a single pivotal placebo-controlled Phase III study, 200622 in support of this 
marketing authorization application. This study is supplemented with efficacy data from the OLE study 
205203. Studies MHE100185 and MHE100901 were also provided by the applicant however, due to 
Assessment report  
EMA/560938/2021  
Page 133/140 
 
 
 
differences in patient population, endpoints, eosinophil blinding, and mepolizumab doses the role of 
these studies in support of this application is limited.  
The primary endpoint in this study was the proportion of subjects who experienced a HES flare during 
the 32-week Treatment Period. HES flares were defined as either: (a) a HES-related clinical 
manifestation based on a physician documented change in clinical signs or symptoms resulting in the 
need for therapy adjustment (increase in OCS dose of at least 10mg/day or any increase in or addition 
of any cytotoxic/ immunosuppressive HES therapy), or (b) receipt of two or more courses of blinded 
active OCS during the study treatment period. 
This endpoint was discussed during the CHMP scientific advice. While this primary endpoint has never 
been tested in previous trials, in principle, it was considered acceptable and clinically relevant for the 
selected target population.   
3.2.  Favourable effects 
This primary endpoint was met as significantly less flares were reported in patients treated with 
mepolizumab as compared to those on placebo i.e. there were 17 flares in 14 (26%) subjects 
randomized to mepolizumab compared to 48 flares in 28 (52%) subjects in the placebo group. The odd 
ratio for comparison of mepolizumab 300 mg vs placebo (primary analysis) was 0.28 (95%CI (0.12, 
0.64, p value=0.003). 
Three out of 4 these secondary endpoints under multiplicity adjustment were also investigated the 
effect of Mepolizumab on flares. These endpoints were: time to first HES flare, proportion of subjects 
who experienced a HES flare during Week 20 through Week 32 and rate of HES flares. The results of 
these secondary endpoints were consistent with the primary endpoint results. The risk of a first HES 
flare over the treatment period was 66% lower for subjects treated with mepolizumab compared with 
placebo (hazard ratio: 0.34; 95% CI 0.18, 0.67). From Week 20 through Week 32, fewer subjects 
experienced a HES flare or withdrew from the study when treated with mepolizumab compared with 
placebo (17% vs. 35% respectively, p=0.020). Finally, the treatment with mepolizumab resulted in a 
statistically significant reduction in the annualized rate of HES flares (calculated for each subject as 
number of HES flares divided by time in the study) compared with placebo (unadjusted p=0.002; 
adjusted p=0.020).  
Only one secondary endpoint was not investigating flares but assessed the effect on fatigue severity by 
using Brief Fatigue Inventory [BFI]) score. Using this score a statistically significant reduction in 
fatigue severity at Week 32 for subjects treated with mepolizumab compared with placebo were 
reported (unadjusted p=0.036; adjusted p=0.036). 
Some exploratory endpoints (HES Daily Symptoms (HES-DS) scale) also recorded improvements in 
symptoms. For HES Daily Symptoms (HES-DS) scale there was a significant reduction (improvement) 
in the most bothersome symptom score at Week 32 for subjects treated with mepolizumab compared 
with Placebo as assessed through the use of HES-DS score. For some other exploratory endpoints no 
improvements were recorded.  
The long-term efficacy was assessed in the open label extension (OLE) study 205203. 
In the OLE flares were reported infrequently with slightly better results reported in patients treated 
with mepolizumab in the parent study as compared to those who originally received placebo.  In total, 
there were 8 flares in 6 (12%) subjects previously treated with placebo and 3 flares in 3 (6%) subjects 
(1 flare each) previously treated with mepolizumab. Overall, the estimated annualized rate of HES 
flares based on the 20-week treatment period was 0.26/year (95% CI 0.13, 0.52) which was lower 
than the rate recorded in the pivotal study (0.5/year in the mepolizumab and 1.46 in the placebo 
Assessment report  
EMA/560938/2021  
Page 134/140 
 
 
 
group). In the extension study, some small reduction in OCS dose was possible.  The mean change 
from baseline OCS dose during Week 16 to 20 was -2.3 mg/day (prednisone or equivalent). The 
proportion of all subjects who achieved a mean OCS dose ≤7.5mg/day (prednisone or equivalent) was 
75% during Week 16 to 20 compared with 61% during Week 0 to 4. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
A primary focus of the pivotal study was the assessment of efficacy of Mepolizumab in reducing 
exacerbations (flares)The primary endpoint in this study was the proportion of subjects who 
experienced a HES flare during the 32-week Treatment Period. In addition, 3 out of 4 secondary 
endpoints under multiplicity adjustment strategy also investigated the effect of mepolizumab on flares.   
On the other hand, the effects of mepolizumab on other aspects of the disease or symptoms were only 
briefly examined. 
Various patient reported outcome questionnaires were used in the study to assess changes in 
symptoms in patients receiving mepolizumab as compared to those on placebo. However, only one 
endpoint investigating the effect on fatigue severity (Brief Fatigue Inventory [BFI]) score item 3) was 
under multiplicity adjustment strategy. The remaining assessments were only exploratory. BFI score 
was developed to rapidly assess the severity and impact of cancer-related fatigue. It is not validated in 
patients with HES although, according to the MAH recommended by one external HES expert as 
appropriate to capture the patient perspective of fatigue, a key symptom of HES.  
Only limited organ-specific assessments were performed in the study i.e. lung function tests and 
echocardiogram scans. These tests showed no difference between the treatment groups. Other 
assessments such as neurological examinations, CT scans of the abdomen, sinuses, or chest, or skin 
assessments were not performed.  
Patients with clinically significant cardiac damage, current active liver or biliary disease liver (with ALT 
>2.5xULN or ALT>5xULN or Bilirubin >1.5xULN) or life-threatening HES were excluded from the study. 
Cardiovascular complications of HES are a major source of morbidity and mortality in this disease, 
whereas liver involvement has been reported to be fairly common in HES.  The SmPC was updated to 
state that Nucala has not been studied in patients with life-threatening manifestations of HES. 
Various patterns of disease courses are observed in hypereosinophilic syndromes (HES). Some patients 
are experiencing a single flare without subsequent relapse. For these patients a long-term therapy is 
unlikely to be needed. Others suffer from several relapses with intervals of complete remission. Last, a 
third set of patients have chronic persistent disease. It seems that the majority of patients enrolled to 
the pivotal study have relapsing or persistent disease. 77% of patients were taking chronic OCS or 
cytotoxic/immunosuppressive therapy at Baseline. In addition, all patients were required to have blood 
eosinophil count >1000 cells/uL despite receiving SoC therapy. Further, a history of two or more HES 
flares within the past 12 months prior to screening were required for enrolment. Therefore, the agreed 
indication reflects the population of patients investigated in the pivotal study i.e. patients with 
relapsing and chronic persistent disease. 
In addition, patients with F/P fusion tyrosine kinase gene translocation were excluded and this is 
reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
From clinical trial data in patients with HES, mepolizumab treated patients experienced a similar level 
of AEs compared to placebo treated patients. Most AEs were mild to moderate in severity. Fatigue,

injection site reaction, arthralgia, myalgia and headache were the most common adverse reactions to 
occur across both controlled studies.  
When comparing mepolizumab treated patients to placebo treated patients in the controlled studies: 
there were a number of preferred terms that had a relative risk of >2, there was an increased rate of 
severe AEs (28% versus 20%), adverse reactions (29% versus 20%), SAEs (18% versus 14%) and 
serious infections (9% and 1%) across both controlled studies. In addition, in the pivotal study with 
the to be licensed posology, there was an increased number of haemorrhage events when comparing 
mepolizumab treated patients to placebo treated patients (19% versus 7%). 
AESI include systemic reactions, local injection site reactions, infections, malignancies, and 
cardiovascular safety events. Hypersensitivity reactions (systemic allergic) and local injection site 
reactions are listed in SmPC, while Alterations in immune response (malignancies) and cardiovascular 
events are listed in the RMP.  
Malignancies occurred at a similar frequency in both mepolizumab and placebo-treated participants in 
the main controlled studies, however a total of 18 cases of lymphoma occurred in HES patients (out of 
19 cases in the mepolizumab development programme). Many of these lymphomas occurred in the L-
HES variant, known to be associated with an increased risk of developing lymphomas and some 
occurred within 90 days of starting mepolizumab treatment and likely to be pre-existing. However, 
there were a number of lymphoma cases that were considered related, possibly related, or had 
unknown relatedness to mepolizumab, while 2 cases were also fatal. 
There was a 7% mortality rate in HES patients treated with mepolizumab. The majority of these 
fatalities occurred in the early access programme ( AP). Patients in the EAP had severe HES and organ- 
or life-threatening disease that had not responded to multiple standard of care therapies and were 
often too unstable to enter placebo-controlled clinical studies. Patients were excluded from the clinical 
trials if they had life-threatening HES or HES co-morbidities. The EAP patients therefore represented a 
higher risk than HES patients recruited in the controlled and OLE clinical trials and the 7% fatality rate 
for the mepolizumab HES clinical programme compares favourably to the estimated background 
incidence rates from literature reports of a 8 – 15% fatality rate.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The number of patients recruited to HES controlled studies is low, limiting interpretation of 
unfavourable effects. The long-term safety in adult patients with HES remains unknown.  
In one of the two controlled studies, patients received mepolizumab by i.v. administration and at a 
dose of 750mg, the proposed licenced posology for HES is s.c. administration and at the lower dose of 
300mg. The data in this study is therefore not reflective of the 300mg  dose and route of 
administration to be approved and should be considered supportive safety data.  
The majority of the EAP data is also at a higher dosing level with a longer duration of treatment than 
the controlled studies and thus are not reflective of the proposed 300mgHES dose and should be 
considered supportive safety data.  
The majority of lymphomas and fatalities in HES patients occurred in uncontrolled OLE studies and the 
EAP programme. HES is known to be associated with an increased risk of developing lymphomas, 
however the rarity of HES makes its hard to determine the normal background incidence of lymphoma 
in HES. Similarly considering the rarity of HES it is not possible to confirm the estimated background 
incidence of fatalities in HES patients.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The treatment with mepolizumab was associated with a significant reduction in the number of flares as 
compared to the placebo group in patients enrolled to this pivotal study.  
The primary endpoint in the pivotal study was met. There were 17 flares in 14 (26%) subjects 
randomized to mepolizumab compared to 48 flares in 28 (52%) subjects in the placebo group. The odd

ratio for comparison of mepolizumab 300 mg vs placebo (primary analysis) was 0.28 (95%CI (0.12, 
0.64, p value=0.003) 
Three out of 4 these secondary endpoints under multiplicity adjustment were also investigated the 
effect of mepolizumab on flares. These endpoints were: time to first HES flare, proportion of subjects 
who experienced a HES flare during Week 20 through Week 32 and rate of HES flares. The results of 
these secondary endpoints were consistent with the primary endpoint results.  
Further the Applicant agreed to the CHMP request to reflect the use of this medicine in patients without 
an identifiable non-haematologic secondary cause, based on the aetiologies of HES and the 
pharmacological activity of mepolizumab. 
During the assessment of the application, the MAH was requested by CHMP to discuss and justify why 
the criteria which defined severity of the disease were not reflected in the text of the indication.  
The applicant was requested to  
• 
• 
update the indication reflecting that Nucala is to be given to patients with relapsing or persistent 
disease i.e. receiving a chronic therapy for the HES. 
highlight that patients with ‘severe HES’ were enrolled to the pivotal study.  
The CHMP finally agreed that the use the term “inadequately controlled” to appropriately qualify the 
study population was considered more meaningful to prescribers as there is no accepted definition for 
severe HES in the medical community. The CHMP considers that the indication as mentioned below is 
reflecting the population studied and does not expand to patients with milder disease. Further details 
of inadequate control are described in the study eligibility criteria in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
The wording of the agreed indication reads:  
Nucala is indicated as an add-on treatment for adult patients with inadequately controlled 
hypereosinophilic syndrome without an identifiable non-haematologic secondary cause (see Section 
5.1).” 
The MAH was requested to discuss approach to patients for whom a long-term remission was achieved. 
Since there is no accepted definition of remission and/or its assessment criteria which could be used 
standardly in clinical practice to declare either lack of efficacy or achievement of long-term remission, 
the decision to stop or continue mepolizumab treatment of HES patients shall be based on the 
physician’s clinical judgment, which is guided by the patient’s overall clinical status and its background 
medication. Therefore, the following text was included in the SmPC and agreed with CHMP, reflecting 
also that mepolizumab was not studied in patients with life-threatening HES condition.: 
Nucala is intended for long-term treatment. The need for continued therapy should be considered 
reviewed at least on an annual basis determined by physician assessment of the patient’s disease 
severity and level of symptom control. Patients who develop life-threatening manifestations of HES 
should also be evaluated for the need for continued therapy, as Nucala has not been studied in this 
population 
The most important and concerning unfavourable effects relate to malignancies (lymphomas) defined as 
a safety concern and the overall mortality rate (approx. 7%). The majority of the fatalities occurred in 
the EAP programme where patients in this programme had severe HES and organ- or life-threatening 
disease that had not responded to multiple standard of care therapies and were often too unstable to 
enter placebo-controlled clinical studies. Patients were excluded from the clinical trials if they had life-
threatening HES or HES co-morbidities. The EAP patients therefore represented a higher risk than HES 
patients  recruited  in  the  controlled  and  OLE  clinical  trials.  The  majority  of  lymphomas  and  fatalities 
Assessment report  
EMA/560938/2021  
Page 138/140 
 
 
 
occurred in the EAP programme where subjects were on average treated with higher i.v. doses than the 
proposed licenced posology. This safety concern will be followed as routine pharmacovigilance. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The agreed indication is as follows adequately reflecting the studied population:  
Nucala  is  indicated  as  an  add-on  treatment  for  adult  patients  with  inadequately  controlled 
hypereosinophilic syndrome without an identifiable non-haematologic secondary cause (see Section 5.1).

Extension of indication to include hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) for Nucala (mepolizumab); as a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2. In addition, section 6.6 of the SmPC (for the 
powder for solution for injection only) has been updated to introduce minor clarifications. The Package 
Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 7.2. of the RMP has also been adopted.  
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and 
to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I, II and IIIB and to the 
Risk Management Plan are recommended. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0384/2020 and the results of these studies are reflected in the

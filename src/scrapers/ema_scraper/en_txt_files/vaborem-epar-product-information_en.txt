Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of meropenem/vaborbactam in children and adolescents younger than 18 years of 
age have not yet been established. No data are available. 
Method of administration  
Intravenous use. 
Vaborem is administered by intravenous infusion over 3 hours.  
For instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 
6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Hypersensitivity to any carbapenem antibacterial agent. 
Severe hypersensitivity (e.g. anaphylactic reaction, severe skin reaction) to any other type of beta-lactam 
antibacterial agent (e.g. penicillins, cephalosporins or monobactams). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with meropenem and/or 
meropenem/vaborbactam (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). 
Patients who have a history of hypersensitivity to carbapenems, penicillins or other beta-lactam 
antibacterial agents may also be hypersensitive to meropenem/vaborbactam. Before initiating therapy with 
Vaborem, careful inquiry should be made concerning previous hypersensitivity reactions to beta-lactam 
antibiotics. 
If a severe allergic reaction occurs, treatment with Vaborem must be discontinued immediately and 
adequate emergency measures must be initiated. Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR), such as 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and 
systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme (EM) and acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis 
(AGEP) have been reported in patients receiving meropenem (see section 4.8). If signs and symptoms 
suggestive of these reactions appear, meropenem should be withdrawn immediately and an alternative 
treatment should be considered.

Seizures 
Seizures have been reported during treatment with meropenem (see section 4.8). 
Patients with known seizure disorders should continue anticonvulsant therapy. Patients who develop focal 
tremors, myoclonus, or seizures should be evaluated neurologically and placed on anticonvulsant therapy 
if not already instituted. If necessary, the dose of meropenem/vaborbactam should be adjusted based on 
renal function (see section 4.2). Alternatively, meropenem/vaborbactam should be discontinued (see 
section 4.5). 
Hepatic function monitoring 
Hepatic function should be closely monitored during treatment with meropenem/vaborbactam due to the 
risk of hepatic toxicity (hepatic dysfunction with cholestasis and cytolysis) (see section 4.8).  
Patients with pre-existing liver disorders should have liver function monitored during treatment with 
meropenem/vaborbactam. There is no dose adjustment necessary (see section 4.2).  
Antiglobulin test (Coombs test) seroconversion 
A positive direct or indirect Coombs test may develop during treatment with meropenem/vaborbactam as 
seen with meropenem (see section 4.8). 
Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea 
Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea has been reported with meropenem/vaborbactam. The condition 
can range in severity from mild diarrhoea to fatal colitis and should be considered in patients who present 
with diarrhoea during or subsequent to the administration of Vaborem (see section 4.8). Discontinuation 
of therapy with Vaborem and the administration of specific treatment for Clostridium difficile should be 
considered. Medicinal products that inhibit peristalsis should not be given. 
Concomitant use with valproic acid/sodium valproate/valpromide  
Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to 
patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium may reduce plasma levels of valproic acid to 
concentrations below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, thus increasing the risk of 
breakthrough seizures. If administration of Vaborem is necessary, supplemental anticonvulsant therapy 
should be considered (see section 4.5). 
Limitations of the clinical data 
Complicated intra-abdominal infections  
The use of Vaborem to treat patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections is based on experience 
with meropenem alone and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analyses of meropenem/vaborbactam.  
Hospital-acquired pneumonia, including ventilator-associated pneumonia 
The use of Vaborem to treat patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia, including ventilator-associated 
pneumonia, is based on experience with meropenem alone and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic 
analyses for meropenem/vaborbactam. 
Patients with limited treatment options 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The use of Vaborem to treat patients with infections due to bacterial organisms who have limited 
treatment options is based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses for meropenem/vaborbactam 
and on limited data from a randomised clinical study in which 32 patients were treated with Vaborem and 
15 patients were treated with best available therapy for infections caused by carbapenem-resistant 
organisms (see section 5.1).  
Spectrum of activity of meropenem/vaborbactam 
Meropenem does not have activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and 
Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) or vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE). Alternative or 
additional antibacterial agents should be used when these pathogens are known or suspected to be 
contributing to the infectious process.  
The inhibitory spectrum of vaborbactam includes class A carbapenemases (such as KPC) and Class C 
carbapenemases. Vaborbactam does not inhibit class D carbapenemases such as OXA-48 or class B 
metallo-β-lactamases such as NDM and VIM (see section 5.1). 
Non-susceptible organisms 
The use of meropenem/vaborbactam may result in the overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, which 
may require interruption of treatment or other appropriate measures. 
Controlled sodium diet 
Vaborem contains 250 mg of sodium per vial, equivalent to 12,5% of the WHO recommended maximum 
daily intake of 2 g of sodium for an adult. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
In vitro data suggests a potential for induction of CYP1A2 (meropenem), CYP3A4 (meropenem and 
vaborbactam) and potentially other PXR regulated enzymes and transporters (meropenem and 
vaborbactam). When administering Vaborem concomitantly with medicinal products that are 
predominantly metabolised by CYP1A2 (e.g theophylline), CYP3A4 (e.g alprazolam, midazolam, 
tacrolimus, sirolimus, cyclosporine, simvastatin, omeprazole, nifedipine, quinidine and ethinylestradiol) 
and/or CYP2C (e.g. warfarin, phenytoin) and/or transported by P-gp (e.g. dabigatran, digoxin) there could 
be a potential risk of interaction which may result in decreased plasma concentrations and activity of the 
co-administered medicinal product. Therefore, patients taking such medicinal products should be 
monitored for possible clinical signs of altered therapeutic efficacy. 
Both meropenem and vaborbactam are substrates of OAT3 and as such, probenecid competes with 
meropenem for active tubular secretion and thus inhibits the renal excretion of meropenem and the same 
mechanism could apply for vaborbactam. Co-administration of probenecid with Vaborem is not 
recommended, as it may result in increased plasma concentrations of meropenem and vaborbactam. 
Concomitant administration of meropenem and valproic acid has been associated with reductions in 
valproic acid concentrations with subsequent loss in seizure control. Data from in vitro and animal studies 
suggest that carbapenems may inhibit the hydrolysis of valproic acid’s glucuronide metabolite (VPA g) 
back to valproic acid, thus decreasing the serum concentrations of valproic acid. Therefore, supplemental 
anticonvulsant therapy should be administered when concomitant administration of valproic acid and 
meropenem/vaborbactam cannot be avoided (see section 4.4). 
Oral anticoagulants 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Simultaneous administration of antibacterial agents with warfarin may augment its anticoagulant effects. 
There have been many reports of increases in the anticoagulant effects of orally administered 
anticoagulants, including warfarin in patients, who are concomitantly receiving antibacterial agents. The 
risk may vary with the underlying infection, age and general status of the patient so that the contribution 
of the antibacterial agent to the increase in international normalised ratio (INR) is difficult to assess. It is 
recommended that the INR should be monitored frequently during and shortly after co-administration of 
Vaborem with an oral anticoagulant. 
Contraceptives 
Vaborem may decrease the efficacy of hormonal contraceptive medicinal products containing oestrogen 
and/or progesterone. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use alternative effective 
contraceptive methods during treatment with Vaborem and for a period of 28 days after discontinuation of 
treatment.  
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of 
meropenem/vaborbactam in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful 
effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Vaborem during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
Meropenem has been reported to be excreted in human milk. It is unknown whether vaborbactam is 
excreted in human milk or animal milk. Because a risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded, 
breastfeeding must be discontinued prior to initiating therapy. 
Fertility 
The effects of meropenem/vaborbactam on fertility in humans have not been studied. Animal studies 
conducted with meropenem and vaborbactam do not indicate harmful effects with respect to fertility (see 
section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Vaborem has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Seizures have been reported 
during treatment with meropenem alone, especially in patients treated with anticonvulsants (see section 
4.4). Meropenem/vaborbactam may cause headache, paraesthesia, lethargy and dizziness (see section 4.8). 
Therefore, caution should be exercised when driving or using machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse reactions that occurred among 322 patients from the pooled Phase 3 studies 
were headache (8.1%), diarrhoea (4.7%), infusion site phlebitis (2.2%) and nausea (2.2%). 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Severe adverse reactions were observed in two patients (0.6 %), one infusion related reaction and one 
blood alkaline phosphatase increased respectively.  In one additional patient, a serious adverse reaction of 
infusion related reaction was reported (0.3%). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The following adverse reactions have been reported with meropenem alone and/or identified during the 
Phase 3 studies with Vaborem. Adverse reactions are classified according to frequency and System Organ 
Class. Adverse reactions listed in the table with a frequency of “unknown” were not observed in patients 
participating in studies with Vaborem or meropenem but have been reported in the post-marketing setting 
for meropenem alone. 
Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1 000 to 
<1/100); rare (≥1/10 000 to <1/1 000); very rare (<1/10 000); unknown (cannot be estimated from the 
available data). Within each System Organ Class, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing 
seriousness.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are 
asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is no experience with overdose of Vaborem.  
Limited post-marketing experience with meropenem alone indicates that if adverse reactions occur 
following overdose, they are consistent with the adverse reaction profile described in section 4.8, are 
generally mild in severity and resolve on withdrawal or dose reduction.   
In the event of overdose, discontinue Vaborem and institute general supportive treatment. In individuals 
with normal renal function, rapid renal elimination will occur. 
Meropenem and vaborbactam can be removed by haemodialysis. In subjects with end stage renal disease 
(ESRD) administered 1 g meropenem and 1 g vaborbactam, the mean total recovery in dialysate following 
a haemodialysis session was 38% and 53% for meropenem and vaborbactam, respectively.

5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antibacterials for systemic use, carbapenems, ATC code: J01DH52 
Mechanism of action 
Meropenem exerts bactericidal activity by inhibiting peptidoglycan cell wall synthesis as a result of 
binding to and inhibition of activity of essential penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs).  
Vaborbactam is a non-beta-lactam inhibitor of class A and class C serine beta-lactamases, including 
Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase, KPC. It acts by forming a covalent adduct with beta-lactamases 
and is stable to beta-lactamase-mediated hydrolysis. Vaborbactam does not inhibit class B enzymes 
(metallo-β-lactamases) or class D carbapenemases.  Vaborbactam has no antibacterial activity. 
Resistance  
Mechanisms of resistance in Gram-negative bacteria that are known to affect meropenem/vaborbactam 
include organisms that produce metallo-β-lactamases or oxacillinases with carbapenemase activity.  
Mechanisms of bacterial resistance that could decrease the antibacterial activity of 
meropenem/vaborbactam include porin mutations affecting outer membrane permeability and 
overexpression of efflux pumps. 
Antibacterial activity in combination with other antibacterial agents 
In vitro studies demonstrated no antagonism between meropenem/vaborbactam and levofloxacin, 
tigecycline, polymyxin, amikacin, vancomycin, azithromycin, daptomycin or linezolid. 
Susceptibility testing break points 
Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints established by the European Committee on 
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST - Breakpoint tables for interpretation of MICs and zone 
diameters, version 1.0, 2021) are as follows: 
Organisms 
Enterobacterales 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
1For susceptibility testing purposes, the concentration of vaborbactam is fixed at 8 mg/l. 
Susceptible 
≤81 
≤81  
Resistant 
>81  
>81  
Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (mg/l) 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship  
The antimicrobial activity of meropenem has been shown to best correlate with the percent of the dosing 
interval during which the free meropenem concentrations in plasma exceed the meropenem minimum 
inhibitory concentration. For vaborbactam, the PK-PD index associated with antimicrobial activity is the 
ratio of free vaborbactam plasma AUC: meropenem/vaborbactam MIC. 
Clinical efficacy against specific pathogens 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Efficacy has been demonstrated in clinical studies against the following pathogens that were susceptible to 
meropenem/vaborbactam in vitro. 
Complicated urinary-tract infections, including pyelonephritis 
Gram-negative micro-organisms: 
•  Escherichia coli 
•  Klebsiella pneumoniae 
•  Enterobacter cloacae species complex 
Clinical efficacy has not been established against the following pathogens that are relevant to the approved 
indications although in vitro studies suggest that they would be susceptible to meropenem and/or 
meropenem/vaborbactam in the absence of acquired mechanisms of resistance.

•  Proteus mirabilis 
•  Providencia spp. 
•  Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
•  Serratia marcescens 
Gram-positive micro-organisms: 
•  Staphylococcus saprophyticus 
•  Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin susceptible isolates only) 
•  Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin susceptible isolates only) 
•  Streptococcus agalactiae 
Anaerobic micro-organisms: 
•  Bacteroides fragilis 
•  Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron 
•  Clostridium perfringens 
•  Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus 
•  Peptostreptococcus species (including P. micros, P anaerobius, P. magnus) 
•  Bacteroides caccae 
•  Prevotella bivia 
•  Prevotella disiens 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Vaborem in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of infections due to Gram-
negative bacteria (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Distribution 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. The plasma protein binding of 
vaborbactam is approximately 33%.  
The steady-state volumes of distribution of meropenem and vaborbactam in patients were 20.2 L and 
18.6 L, respectively, following doses of 2 g meropenem/2 g vaborbactam infused over 3 hours every 
8 hours, indicating that both compounds distribute into a volume of distribution consistent with the 
extracellular fluid compartment. 
Both meropenem and vaborbactam penetrate into human bronchial epithelial lining fluid (ELF) with 
concentrations around 65% and 79% of unbound plasma concentrations of meropenem and vaborbactam, 
respectively. The concentration time profiles are similar for ELF and plasma. 
Biotransformation 
Meropenem is mostly eliminated unchanged. About 25% of the administered dose is eliminated as the 
inactive open ring form.  
Vaborbactam does not undergo metabolism. 
Elimination 
The terminal half-life (t½) is 2.30 hours and 2.25 hours for meropenem and vaborbactam, respectively. 
Both meropenem and vaborbactam are primarily excreted via the kidneys. Approximately 40-60% of a 
meropenem dose is excreted unchanged within 24 - 48 hours with a further 25% recovered as the 
microbiologically inactive hydrolysis product. The elimination of meropenem by the kidneys resulted in 
high therapeutic concentrations in urine. The mean renal clearance for meropenem was 7.7 L/h. The mean 
non-renal clearance for meropenem was 4.8 L/h, which comprises both fecal elimination (~2% of the 
dose) and degradation due to hydrolysis. 
Approximately 75 to 95% of vaborbactam is excreted unchanged in the urine over a 24 - 48 hour period. 
The elimination of vaborbactam by the kidneys resulted in high concentrations in the urine. The mean 
renal clearance for vaborbactam was 10.5 L/h.  
Linearity/non-linearity 
The Cmax and AUC of meropenem and vaborbactam are linear across the dose range studied (1 g to 2 g for 
meropenem and 0.25 g to 2 g for vaborbactam) when administered as a single 3-hour intravenous infusion. 
There is no accumulation of meropenem or vaborbactam following multiple intravenous infusions 
administered every 8 hours for 7 days in subjects with normal renal function.  
Effect of vaborbactam/meropenem on enzymes and transporters 
Neither meropenem nor vaborbactam inhibit CYP450 enzymes in vitro at pharmacologically relevant 
concentrations. 
Both meropenem and vaborbactam do not inhibit renal or hepatic transporters at pharmacologically 
relevant concentrations. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacokinetic studies with meropenem and vaborbactam in patients with renal impairment have shown 
that the plasma clearance of both meropenem and vaborbactam correlates with creatinine clearance. 
Hepatic impairment 
As meropenem/vaborbactam does not undergo hepatic metabolism, the systemic clearance of 
meropenem/vaborbactam is not expected to be affected by hepatic impairment. 
Elderly 
Pharmacokinetic data from a population pharmacokinetic analysis showed a reduction in plasma clearance 
of meropenem/vaborbactam that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. 
Gender and race 
In a population pharmacokinetic analysis there was no effect of gender or race on the pharmacokinetics of 
meropenem and vaborbactam. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Meropenem 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, reproduction toxicity or genotoxicity. Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted 
with meropenem. 
Vaborbactam 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, reproduction toxicity or genotoxicity. Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted 
with vaborbactam. 
In repeat dose toxicity studies in dogs, minimal hepatic inflammation was observed after 14 days and 28 
days of exposure to vaborbactam alone or combined meropenem/vaborbactam.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Vaborem is and what it is used for  
What Vaborem is 
Vaborem is an antibiotic medicine that contains two active substances: meropenem and vaborbactam. 
• 
Meropenem belongs to group of antibiotics called “carbapenems”. It can kill many types of bacteria 
by preventing them from building the protective walls that surround their cells. 
Vaborbactam is a “beta lactamase inhibitor”. It blocks the action of an enzyme that allows some 
bacteria to resist the action of meropenem. This helps meropenem kill some bacteria that it cannot 
kill on its own.   
• 
What Vaborem is used for 
Vaborem is used in adults to treat certain serious bacterial infections: 
• 
• 
• 
of the bladder or kidneys (urinary tract infections) 
of the stomach and gut (intra-abdominal infections) 
of the lungs (pneumonia) 
It is also used to treat infections 
• 
• 
of the blood associated with any of the infections mentioned above 
caused by bacteria that other antibiotics may not be able to kill 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Vaborem  
You must not be given Vaborem if 
• 
you are allergic to meropenem, vaborbactam or the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
you are allergic to other carbapenem antibiotics (the group to which meropenem belongs). 
you have ever had a severe allergic reaction to related antibiotics belonging to the beta-lactam group 
(including penicillins, cephalosporins or monobactams).  
• 
• 
Warnings and precautions  
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Talk to your doctor or nurse before receiving Vaborem if: 
• 
you have ever had any allergic reaction to other antibiotics belonging to the beta-lactam group 
(including carbapenems, penicillins, cephalosporins, or monobactams) 
you have ever developed severe diarrhoea during or after antibiotic treatment 
you have ever suffered from seizures 
• 
• 
If any of the above apply to you or you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before using Vaborem. 
You may develop signs and symptoms of severe skin reactions (see section 4). If this happens talk to your 
doctor or nurse immediately so that they can treat the symptoms. 
Talk to your doctor or nurse if you suffer from diarrhoea during your treatment. 
This medicine can affect your liver. Your doctor may take some blood to check how well your liver is 
working while taking the medicine. 
New infection 
Although Vaborem can fight certain bacteria, there is a possibility that you may get a different infection 
caused by another organism during or after your treatment. Your doctor will monitor you closely for any 
new infections and give you another treatment if necessary. 
Blood tests 
Tell your doctor that you are taking Vaborem if you are going to have any blood tests. This is because you 
may get an abnormal result with something called a “Coombs test”. This test looks for the presence of 
antibodies that can destroy red blood cells or may be affected by the response of your immune system to 
Vaborem. 
Children or adolescents 
Vaborem should not be used in children or adolescents under 18 years of age. This is because it is not 
known if the medicine is safe to use in these age groups. 
Other medicines and Vaborem 
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
It is particularly important to tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: 
• 
medicines used to treat epilepsy called valproic acid, sodium valproate or valpromide because 
Vaborem may decrease their effect  
a medicine for gout called probenecid 
oral anticoagulant medicines, such as warfarin (used to treat or prevent blood clots) 
hormonal oral contraceptives containing oestrogen and/or progesterone because Vaborem may 
decrease their effect. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use alternative effective 
contraceptive methods during treatment with Vaborem and for a period of 28 days after 
discontinuation of treatment.  
medicines predominantly metabolised by CYP1A2 (e.g theophylline), CYP3A4 (e.g alprazolam, 
midazolam, tacrolimus, sirolimus, cyclosporine, simvastatin, omeprazole, nifedipine, quinidine and 
ethinylestradiol) and/or CYP2C (e.g. warfarin, phenytoin) and/or transported by P-gp (e.g. 
dabigatran, digoxin) because Vaborem may decrease their effect.  
Tell your doctor before using Vaborem if any of the above apply to you. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice 
before receiving this medicine. 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As a precautionary measure, you should not be given this medicine during pregancy. 
It is important that you tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or if you intend to breast-feed before 
receiving Vaborem. Small amounts of this medicine may pass into the breast milk and it may affect the 
baby. Therefore, you must discontinue breastfeeding before you are given Vaborem. 
Driving and using machines 
Vaborem may make you feel dizzy, sleepy and sluggish, give you a headache or tingling sensation (like 
“pins and needles”) or, in rare cases, cause a fit or seizure. This may affect your ability to drive, use tools 
or machines.  
Vaborem contains sodium 
This medicine contains 250 mg of sodium (main component of cooking salt) in each vial. This is 
equivalent to 12,5% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium salt for an adult. 
3. 
How you will be given Vaborem 
The recommended dose is 2 vials (a total of 2 g meropenem and 2 g vaborbactam), given every 8 hours. 
Your doctor will decide how many days of treatment are needed, depending on the type of infection. 
Vaborem will be given to you by a doctor or nurse by infusion (a drip) into a vein, lasting 3 hours.  
Patients with kidney problems 
If you have kidney problems, your doctor may lower your dose. Your doctor may also want to do some 
blood tests to see how well your kidneys are working. 
If you are given more Vaborem than you should 
Vaborem will be given to you by a doctor or a nurse, so it is unlikely you will be given the wrong dose. If 
you think you have been given too much Vaborem, tell your doctor or nurse straight away.  
If you miss a dose of Vaborem 
If you think you have missed a dose, tell your doctor or nurse straight away. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Serious side effects 
Tell your doctor straight away if you notice any of the following serious side effects – you may need 
urgent medical treatment: 
• 
Severe allergic reactions that could include sudden swelling of your lips, face, throat or tongue, 
difficulty swallowing or breathing or a severe rash or other severe skin reactions, or a decrease in 
blood pressure (which could make you feel faint or dizzy). Such reactions may be life-threatening. 
Diarrhoea that keeps getting worse or does not go away, or stools that contains blood or mucus – 
this may happen during or after treatment with Vaborem is stopped. It may be due to bacteria called 
Clostridium difficile. If this happens, do not take medicines that stop or slow bowel movement.

Other sources of information 
Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency website:

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Vaborem is intended for intravenous (IV) administration, only after reconstitution and dilution. 
Standard aseptic techniques must be used for solution preparation and administration. 
The number of vials used for a single dose will depend on the creatinine clearance (CrCl) of the patient.  
Reconstitution:  
20 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection (normal saline) should be withdrawn from 
a 250 ml infusion bag of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection for each vial and 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reconstituted with the appropriate number of vials of meropenem/vaborbactam for the corresponding 
Vaborem dosage:  
•  Reconstitute 2 vials for the Vaborem 2 g/2 g dose 
•  Reconstitute 1 vial for the Vaborem 1 g/1 g and Vaborem 0.5 g/0.5 g doses 
After mixing gently to dissolve, the reconstituted meropenem/vaborbactam solution will have an 
approximate meropenem concentration of 0.05 g/ml and an approximate vaborbactam concentration of 
0.05 g/ml. The final volume is approximately 21.3 ml. The reconstituted solution is not for direct 
injection. The reconstituted solution must be diluted before intravenous infusion. 
Dilution:  
To prepare the Vaborem 2 g/2 g for intravenous infusion: Immediately after reconstitution of two vials, 
the entire reconstituted vial contents should be withdrawn from each of the two vials and added back into 
the 250 ml infusion bag of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection (normal saline). The 
final infusion concentration of meropenem and vaborbactam will be about 8 mg/ml each. 
To prepare the Vaborem 1 g/1 g for intravenous infusion: Immediately after reconstitution of one vial, the 
entire reconstituted vial contents should be withdrawn from the vial and added back into the 250 ml 
infusion bag of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection (normal saline). The final infusion 
concentration of meropenem and vaborbactam will be about 4 mg/ml each. 
To prepare the Vaborem 0.5 g/0.5 g for intravenous infusion: Immediately after reconstitution of one vial, 
10.5 ml of the reconstituted vial contents should be withdrawn from the vial and added back into the 
250 ml infusion bag of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection (normal saline). The final 
infusion concentration of meropenem and vaborbactam will be 2 mg/ml each. 
The diluted solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter. The colour of the diluted solution 
is clear to light yellow.  
Following dilution, the infusion should be completed within 4 hours when stored at 25 °C, or within 
22 hours when refrigerated at 2 – 8 °C. 
From a microbiological point of view, the medicinal product should be used immediately upon 
reconstitution and dilution. 
Vaborem is not chemically compatible with glucose-containing solutions. This medicinal product must not 
be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in section 6.6 of the SmPC.

Summary of risk management plan (RMP) 
Summary of RMP for Jivi® 
This is a summary of the RMP for Jivi®. The RMP details important risks of Jivi®, how these 
risks can be minimised and how more information will be obtained about risks and 
uncertainties (missing information). 
The Summary of Product Characteristic (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Jivi® should be used. 
This summary of the RMP should be read in the context of all this information including the 
assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part of the 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/jivi 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of the 
RMP for Jivi®. 
The medicine and what it is used for 
Jivi® is authorised for indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in previously 
treated patients (PTPs) aged ≥12 years with haemophilia A (congenital Factor VIII [FVIII] 
deficiency) (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains damoctocog alfa pegol as the active 
substance and it is given by injection. 
Further information about the evaluation of Jivi®’s benefits can be found in the EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s 
webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/jivi 
Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further 
characterise the risks 
Important risks of Jivi®, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Jivi®'s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
• 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with 
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of Jivi®, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions (Ars) will be collected 
continuously and regularly analysed, including Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation 
Report/Periodic Safety Update Report (PBRER/PSUR) assessment so that immediate action 
can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Jivi® is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Jivi® are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Jivi®. Potential risks are concerns for 
which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information 
refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs 
to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

Additional pharmacovigilance 
activities 
The development of antibodies to FVIII with neutralising properties 
(known as FVIII inhibitors) may have a great impact on treatment of 
patients with haemophilia. Therefore, inhibitor development is 
considered a medically significant event, and it is regarded as the 
most serious complication of FVIII replacement in patients with 
haemophilia. 
Widely accepted risk factors for inhibitor development to FVIII are 
the severity of the FVIII gene defect, the prior number of exposure 
days (EDs), haemophilia severity, ethnicity, genotype, inhibitor 
testing frequency, intensity of treatment and familial predisposition. 
Other risk factors are still under debate, such as the specific 
treatment regimen, age at first exposure, mode of administration, 
surgery, type of FVIII concentrate, concomitant vaccinations and 
extravasations during injection. 
No additional risk minimisation activities beyond the information 
provided to healthcare professionals and patients in the labelling 
materials are proposed.

Additional pharmacovigilance 
activities 
Hypersensitivity reactions have been observed in the clinical trial 
program. These events are usually mild to moderate in intensity and 
resolve rapidly upon discontinuation of drug administration. 
Hypersensitivity reactions have been observed with the first 4 
infusions primarily in patients <6 years of age. Hypersensitivity may 
also be related to an immune response to polyethylene glycol 
(PEG). In patients ≥12 years the incidence of hypersensitivity 
reactions associated with anti-PEG antibodies was 0.7% (95% 
confidence interval [CI] 0-2.0%). 
No additional risk minimisation activities beyond the information 
provided to healthcare professionals and patients in the labelling 
materials are proposed.

Evidence for linking the risk

Risk factors and risk groups 
Loss of efficacy associated with development of anti-polyethylene 
glycol (PEG) antibodies has been identified in clinical trials. 
The risk was only seen in patients 6 years of age and younger. 
Loss of efficacy associated with development of anti-PEG 
antibodies has been identified in clinical trials following 
administration of the 2nd to 4th dose, with no additional cases 
observed at a later time point.

Risk minimisation measures 
Age <6 years has been determined during the clinical trials to be 
a risk factor for development of anti-PEG immunoglobulin M 
(IgM) antibodies following exposure to Jivi®. Development of 
these antibodies is associated with the clinical events of loss of 
efficacy/hypersensitivity. In order to minimise the risk of these 
events, the population has been restricted to Haemophilia A 
patients age ≥12 years. 
Age <12 years 
Routine risk minimisation measures

Additional pharmacovigilance 
activities 
Accumulation of PEG in the choroid plexus has been 
demonstrated in non-clinical studies of other products at much 
higher doses of PEG than with Jivi®. There is no evidence from 
the non-clinical studies with Jivi® or from the PEG plasma level 
at steady state for clinically relevant accumulation of PEG in 
tissues. 
Very young patients could potentially be more impacted by high 
levels of PEG. 
Information provided to healthcare professionals in the labelling 
materials is proposed.

4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Opzelura is indicated for the treatment of non-segmental vitiligo with facial involvement in adults and 
adolescents from 12 years of age. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Opzelura should be initiated and supervised by physicians with experience in the diagnosis and 
treatment of non-segmental vitiligo. 
Posology 
Adults 
The recommended dose is a thin layer of cream applied twice daily to the depigmented skin areas up 
to a maximum of 10% of body surface area (BSA), with a minimum of 8 hours between two 
applications of ruxolitinib cream. 10% BSA represents an area as large as 10 times the palm of one 
hand with the 5 fingers. Ruxolitinib cream should be used at the smallest skin area necessary. 
No more than two tubes of 100 grams a month should be used. 
Satisfactory repigmentation may require treatment beyond 24 weeks. If there is less than 25% 
repigmentation in treated areas at week 52, treatment discontinuation should be considered. 
Once satisfactory repigmentation is achieved, treatment in those areas can be stopped. If 
depigmentation recurs after treatment discontinuation, therapy can be reinitiated on the affected areas.

There is no need to consider tapering therapy. 
Special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
No studies with ruxolitinib cream have been performed in patients with hepatic impairment. However, 
due to limited systemic exposure, dose adjustment is not necessary in patients with hepatic 
impairment. 
Renal impairment 
No studies with ruxolitinib cream have been performed in patients with renal impairment. However, 
due to limited systemic exposure, dose adjustment is not necessary in patients with renal impairment. 
As a precautionary measure, ruxolitinib cream should not be used by patients with end stage renal 
disease, due to lack of data regarding the safety. 
Elderly 
A limited number of patients aged 65 years and above have been enrolled in the clinical studies with 
Opzelura in vitiligo to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects (see 
section 5.1). No dose adjustment is required in patients aged 65 years and above. 
Paediatric population 
For adolescents (12-17 years) the posology is the same as for adults. 
The safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib cream in children below 12 years of age have not been 
established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
The cream is for cutaneous use only. 
Avoid washing treated skin for at least 2 hours after application of ruxolitinib cream. 
The cream should not be applied to the lips to avoid its ingestion. 
Patients should be instructed to wash their hands after applying the cream, unless it is their hands that 
are being treated. If someone else applies the cream to the patient, they should wash their hands after 
application. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Pregnancy and breastfeeding (see section 4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
The cream is not for ophthalmic, oral, or intravaginal use (see section 4.2). In cases of accidental 
exposure in the eyes or mucous membranes, the cream should be thoroughly wiped off and/or rinsed 
with water.

Non-melanoma skin cancer 
Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs), predominantly basal cell carcinomas, have been reported in 
patients treated with topical ruxolitinib. Most of these patients had risk factors, such as prior 
phototherapy or prior NMSC. A causal relationship to topical ruxolitinib has not been established. 
Periodic skin examination is recommended for all patients, particularly those with risk factors for skin 
cancer. 
Excipients with known effect 
Propylene glycol 
This medicinal product contains 150 mg propylene glycol (E1520) in each gram of cream which may 
cause skin irritation. 
Cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol 
This medicinal product contains cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol which may cause local skin reactions 
(e.g. contact dermatitis). 
Parahydroxybenzoates 
This medicinal product contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E218) and propyl parahydroxybenzoate 
which may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed). 
Butylated hydroxytoluene 
This medicinal product contains butylated hydroxytoluene (E321) which may cause local skin 
reactions (e.g. contact dermatitis), or irritation to the eyes and mucous membranes. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed with topically administered ruxolitinib. 
The potential for interactions with ruxolitinib is considered to be low because of the limited systemic 
exposure following topical administration.  
Based on in vitro data, ruxolitinib is predominantly cleared by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) 
metabolism. Interaction potential was evaluated for oral ruxolitinib in dedicated clinical pharmacology 
studies that included co-administration of strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors or a strong inducer. 
The plasma AUC is approximately doubled with co-administration of a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 
while only a modest increase was seen with co-administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor.  
The use of ruxolitinib cream in combination with other topical medicinal products used to treat vitiligo 
has not been evaluated and co-application on the same skin areas is not recommended. 
Other topical medicinal products used to treat other conditions on the same skin areas should be 
applied with a minimum of 2 hours after the application of ruxolitinib cream. This is also applicable to 
the use of sunscreen or emollients. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Contraception in women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 weeks 
after discontinuation of treatment.

Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of ruxolitinib in pregnant women. Data on 
systemic absorption of topical ruxolitinib during pregnancy are lacking. There could also be individual 
factors (e.g. damaged skin barrier, excessive use) that contribute to an increased systemic exposure. 
Animal studies have shown that ruxolitinib is embryotoxic and foetotoxic following oral 
administration. Teratogenicity was not observed in rats or rabbits (see section 5.3). Opzelura is 
contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3). 
Breast-feeding 
No data are available regarding the presence of ruxolitinib in human milk, the effects on the breastfed 
child, or the effects on milk production after topical application of Opzelura. Following oral 
administration of ruxolitinib to lactating rats, ruxolitinib and/or its metabolites were present in the 
milk with a concentration 13-fold higher than the maternal plasma concentration. In juvenile rat 
studies, oral administration of ruxolitinib resulted in effects on growth and bone measures (see 
section 5.3). Opzelura is contraindicated during breast-feeding (see section 4.3) and treatment must be 
discontinued approximately 4 weeks before the beginning of breastfeeding. 
Fertility  
There are no human data on the effect of ruxolitinib on fertility. In animal studies, no effect of oral 
ruxolitinib on fertility was observed. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Ruxolitinib cream has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Safety was primarily evaluated in the pivotal studies, for up to one year. In the long-term extension 
study (see section 5.1), safety up to 2 years was consistent with the profile reported in the pivotal studies. 
The most common adverse reaction is application site acne (5.8%).  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions are ranked under headings of frequency, with the most frequent first, using the 
following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to 
< 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from 
the available data).

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Adverse Reaction 
Application site acne 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Overdose following cutaneous administration is unlikely. If too much of the cream has been applied, 
the excess can be wiped off. 
In cases of accidental ophthalmic, oral mucosa, or intravaginal exposure, the cream should be 
thoroughly wiped off and/or rinsed with water (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other dermatological preparations, agents for dermatitis, excluding 
corticosteroids, ATC code: D11AH09 
Mechanism of action 
Ruxolitinib is a Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitor with selectivity for the JAK1 and JAK2 isoforms. 
Intracellular JAK signalling involves recruitment of STATs (signal transducers and activators of 
transcription) to cytokine receptors, and subsequent modulation of gene expression. Autoimmune 
IFNγ producing cytotoxic T lymphocytes are thought to be directly responsible for melanocyte 
destruction in human vitiligo. Recruitment of cytotoxic lymphocytes to lesional skin is mediated via 
IFNγ dependent chemokines, such as CXCL10. Downstream signalling of IFNγ is JAK1/2 dependent 
and treatment with ruxolitinib reduces CXCL10 levels in vitiligo patients. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Two double-blind, randomised, vehicle-controlled studies of identical design (TRuE-V1 and 
TRuE-V2) enrolled a total of 674 patients who have vitiligo on the face and total body vitiligo area 
(facial and nonfacial) not exceeding 10% BSA, with disease extent at initiation ranging from 3.2% to 
10.1% of BSA, aged 12 years and older (10.7% of patients were 12 to 17 years of age and 6.7% were 
65 years or older). Females constituted 53.1% of patients, 81.9% of patients were White, 4.7% were 
Black, and 4.2% were Asian. The majority of patients had Fitzpatrick skin types III, IV, V, or VI 
(67.5%). 
In both studies, patients were randomised 2:1 to treatment with ruxolitinib cream or vehicle twice 
daily for 24 weeks with affected BSA not exceeding 10%, followed by an additional 28 weeks of 
treatment with ruxolitinib cream BID for all patients. The primary efficacy endpoint was the 
proportion of patients achieving a 75% repigmentation in the facial Vitiligo Area Scoring Index 
(F-VASI75) at week 24. Key secondary endpoints included the proportions of patients achieving a 
90% repigmentation in F-VASI (F-VASI90), 50% improvement in total body Vitiligo Area Scoring 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Index (T-VASI50), and a Vitiligo Noticeability Scale (VNS) score of 4 or 5 (vitiligo "a lot less 
noticeable" or "no longer noticeable").  
Repigmentation of treated vitiligo lesions and superiority of ruxolitinib cream over vehicle cream were 
observed for both studies, as demonstrated by statistically significant differences in response rates for 
F-VASI75/90, T-VASI50, and VNS score of 4 or 5 at week 24 (Table 2). 
The treatment effect difference from vehicle emerges numerically as early as week 12. Continued 
repigmentation as assessed by VASI and VNS scores was observed through week 52 for patients who 
had continuously applied ruxolitinib cream twice daily from baseline. The proportion of patients who 
achieved F-VASI75 over the 52-week treatment period in pooled data from study TRuE-V1 and 
TRuE-V2 are shown in Figure 1. 
Similar treatment responses at week 52 are seen for those who crossed over from vehicle to ruxolitinib 
(Figure 1).

Proportion of patients achieving F-VASI75 during the 52 week treatment period 
(Intent-to-treat) – pooled data from study TRuE-V1 and TRuE-V2 
At week 52, the observed response rate for F-VASI90, T-VASI50 and VNS was 30.3%, 51.1%, and 
36.3% respectively for the ITT pooled population. 
Durability of response 
A Phase 3, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, randomised, withdrawal and treatment-extension study of 
ruxolitinib cream twice daily enrolled 458 eligible patients with vitiligo who had completed either of 
the parent studies using ruxolitinib  (TRuE-V1 and TRuE-V2; week 52); patients were assigned to 
either cohort A or B with a follow-up up to 104 weeks. 
Cohort A comprised 116 patients who reached ≥ F-VASI90 at week 52 of the parent study. These 
patients were re-randomised to either ruxolitinib or vehicle (i.e. withdrawal) to study relapse 
(< F-VASI75). A relapse occurred in 15% of patients in the ruxolitinib group, and in 29% of patients 
in the vehicle group. In the latter group, the majority of relapses (9/16) occurred during the first 4 
months after stopping ruxolitinib cream. Among the 16 patients in the vehicle group who relapsed and 
were retreated, re-treatment resulted in a regained F-VASI75 in 12 (75%) patients in a median of 12 
weeks and F-VASI90 was regained by 11 (69%) patients in a median of 15 weeks. 
Cohort B comprised 342 patients who reached < F-VASI90 at week 52 of the parent study. These 
patients continued with open-label ruxolitinib treatment; at week 104, among patients originally 
randomised to ruxolitinib cream twice daily, 66% reached F-VASI75, and 34% reached F-VASI90. 
Paediatric population 
A total of 72 adolescents (12 to < 18 years; n = 55 ruxolitinib cream, n = 17 vehicle) were included in 
the pivotal studies. Adolescents showed equal response rates in primary and key secondary endpoints 
at 24 weeks when treated with ruxolitinib, as compared to adults from 18-65 years of age. 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Opzelura in one or more subsets of the paediatric population for the treatment of vitiligo (see section 
4.2 for information on paediatric use).

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
The pharmacokinetics of ruxolitinib cream were investigated in 429 subjects with vitiligo aged 
12 years and older (12.6% were 12-17 years of age) with a mean ± STD BSA involvement of 
7.31 ± 2.02% (range 3.2% to 10.0%). Subjects applied approximately 1.58 mg/cm2 of ruxolitinib 
cream (dose range was approximately 0.18 grams to 8.4 grams of ruxolitinib cream per application) to 
the same skin areas twice daily for 24 weeks. 
The mean ± STD steady-state trough plasma concentrations was 56.9 ± 62.6 nM with a projected 
AUC0-12h at 683 ± 751 h*nM, which is approximately 25% of the observed mean AUC0-12h at steady 
state (2716 h*nM) following 15 mg twice daily oral administration in healthy participants. The mean 
(geometric mean) topical bioavailability for ruxolitinib cream in vitiligo participants in the pooled data 
of the two Phase 3 studies was 9.72% (5.78%). 
Distribution 
Based on an in vitro study, ruxolitinib is 97% bound to human plasma proteins, mostly to albumin. 
Biotransformation 
Ruxolitinib is metabolised by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C9.  
Elimination 
The mean elimination half-life of orally administered ruxolitinib is approximately 3 hours. The mean 
apparent terminal half-life of ruxolitinib following topical application of Opzelura was estimated in 
9 adult and adolescent patients with ≥ 25% BSA involvement with atopic dermatitis and is 
approximately 116 hours, reflecting the slow drug absorption rate rather than the drug elimination rate. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
The estimated AUC which is adjusted for the pharmacological activity of ruxolitinib plus the 
metabolites increases approximately two-fold in case of end stage renal disease (ESRD). As a 
precautionary measure, Opzelura should not be used by patients with ESRD, due to lack of data 
regarding the safety. 
Hepatic impairment 
Although the AUC was increased following oral administration of ruxolitinib to patients with hepatic 
impairment, there was no clear relationship between the severity of hepatic impairment and the 
increase in AUC. A dosing advice for patients with hepatic impairment is not necessary.

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Ruxolitinib has been evaluated in safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and 
reproductive toxicity, and carcinogenicity studies following oral administration. Additional studies 
were conducted following dermal administration in minipigs and mice. Target organs associated with 
the pharmacological action of ruxolitinib in repeated dose oral studies include bone marrow, 
peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues. Infections generally associated with immunosuppression were 
noted in dogs. Margins (based on unbound AUC) at non-adverse levels in chronic toxicity studies 
were approximately 6- and 200-fold in male and female rats, and 10-fold in dogs, relative to systemic 
exposure observed in patients with vitiligo that applied 1.5% ruxolitinib cream twice daily. Adverse 
decreases in blood pressure along with increases in heart rate were noted in a dog telemetry study, and 
an adverse decrease in minute volume was noted in a respiratory study in rats. The margins (based on 
unbound Cmax) at the non-adverse level in the dog and rat studies were approximately 300-fold and 
100-fold greater, respectively, than systemic exposure observed in patients with vitiligo that applied 
1.5% ruxolitinib cream twice daily. No adverse effects were noted in an evaluation of the 
neuropharmacological effects of ruxolitinib in rats.  
A 3-month dermal repeat dose study revealed decreased lymphocyte counts in mice. Margins (based 
on unbound AUC) at non-adverse levels were approximately 10-fold in male and 24-fold in female 
mice relative to systemic exposure observed in patients with vitiligo that applied 1.5% ruxolitinib 
cream twice daily. Non-adverse decreased peripheral lymphocyte counts were also noted in minipigs 
in a 9-month dermal toxicity study. Margins (based on unbound AUC) at non-adverse levels in 
minipigs were approximately 3-fold relative to systemic exposure observed in patients with vitiligo 
that applied 1.5% ruxolitinib cream twice daily. This effect was not observed in a 3-month dermal 
toxicity study in minipigs. No evidence of systemic toxicity was observed in Gottingen minipigs 
following topical administration of 1.5% ruxolitinib cream formulation twice daily for up to 9 months. 
In juvenile rat studies, oral administration of ruxolitinib resulted in effects on growth and bone 
measures. Reduced bone growth was observed at doses ≥ 5 mg/kg/day when treatment started on 
postnatal day 7 (comparable to human newborn) and at ≥ 15 mg/kg/day when treatment started on 
postnatal days 14 or 21 (comparable to human infant, 1–3 years). Fractures and early termination of 
rats were observed at doses ≥ 30 mg/kg/day when treatment was started on postnatal day 7. Based on 
unbound AUC, the exposure at the NOAEL (no observed adverse effect level) in juvenile rats treated 
as early as postnatal day 7 was approximately 20-fold that of adult patients with vitiligo, while 
reduced bone growth and fractures occurred at exposures that were 22- and 150-fold that of adult 
patients with vitiligo, respectively. The effects were generally more severe in males and when 
administration was initiated earlier in the postnatal period. Other than bone development, the effects of 
ruxolitinib in juvenile rats were similar to those in adult rats. Juvenile rats are more sensitive than 
adult rats to ruxolitinib toxicity. 
In embryofetal development studies, oral administration of ruxolitinib to rats and rabbits during 
gestation resulted in decreased foetal weight and increased post-implantation loss at doses associated 
with maternal toxicity. There was no evidence of a teratogenic effect in rats and rabbits. Margins 
(based on unbound AUC) at non-adverse levels for developmental toxicity in rats were approximately 
25-fold the systemic exposure observed in patients with vitiligo that applied 1.5% ruxolitinib cream 
twice daily. No effects of oral ruxolitinib were noted on fertility in male or female rats. In a pre- and 
postnatal development study, a slightly prolonged gestation period, reduced number of implantation 
sites, and reduced number of pups delivered were observed. In the pups, decreased mean initial body 
weights and short period of decreased mean body weight gain were observed. In lactating rats, 
ruxolitinib and/or its metabolites were excreted into the milk with a concentration that was 13-fold 
higher than the maternal plasma concentration. Ruxolitinib was not mutagenic or clastogenic. 
Ruxolinitib showed no carcinogenic potential following topical administration in mice or following 
oral administration in Sprague-Dawley rats and Tg.rasH2 mice.

ruxolitinib

important information for you. 
-  Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  
- 
-  This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, 
If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

3.  How to use Opzelura 
4.  Possible side effects  
5.  How to store Opzelura 
6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Opzelura is and what it is used for 
Opzelura contains the active substance ruxolitinib. It belongs to a group of medicines called Janus 
kinase inhibitors. 
Opzelura is used on the skin to treat vitiligo with facial involvement in adults and adolescents from 
12 years. Vitiligo is an autoimmune disease, where the body’s immune system attacks the cells that 
produce the skin pigment melanin. This causes a loss of melanin, leading to patches of pale pink or 
white skin. In vitiligo, ruxolitinib reduces the immune system’s activity against the melanin-producing 
cells, allowing the skin to produce pigment and regain its normal colour.  
2.  What you need to know before you use Opzelura 
Do not use Opzelura 
- 
if you are allergic to ruxolitinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. 
- 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Opzelura. 
Opzelura is not for use on the lips, in the eyes, mouth or vagina. If cream accidentally gets into these 
areas, thoroughly wipe off and/or rinse off the cream with water. 
Children under 12 years 
Do not give Opzelura to children younger than 12 years because it has not been studied in this age 
group.  
Other medicines and Opzelura 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Using Opzelura at the same time as other medicines on the affected skin is not recommended, as it has 
not been studied. 
After applying Opzelura, wait at least 2 hours before applying other medicines, sunscreen or body 
creams/oils to the same skin area. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Opzelura should not be used by pregnant or breast-feeding women as this has not been investigated. If 
you are a woman of childbearing age, you should use an effective contraception during treatment and 
during 4 weeks after applying Opzelura for the last time. 
It is not known if ruxolitinib passes into breast milk after applying it to the skin. The effects of this 
medicine in breastfed infants are unknown; therefore, Opzelura should not be used if you are 
breast-feeding or planning to breastfeed. You may start breast-feeding approximately four weeks after 
applying Opzelura for the last time. 
Driving and using machines 
Opzelura is unlikely to have an effect on your ability to drive and use machines. 
Opzelura contains propylene glycol, cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, methyl parahydroxybenzoate, 
propyl parahydroxybenzoate and butylated hydroxytoluene 
-  This medicine contains 150 mg propylene glycol (E1520) in each gram of cream, which may 
cause skin irritation. 
-  Cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol may cause local skin reactions (e.g. contact dermatitis). 
-  Methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E218) and propyl parahydroxybenzoate may cause allergic 
reactions (possibly delayed). 
-  Butylated hydroxytoluene (E321) may cause local skin reactions (e.g. contact dermatitis), or 
irritation to the eyes and mucous membranes. 
3. 
How to use Opzelura

or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Recommended dose 
-  Apply a thin layer of cream twice daily to affected areas of your skin. Wait at least 8 hours 
between applications. 
-  The cream should not be used on more than 10% (one tenth) of your body. This surface area 
represents the equivalent to ten times the palm of one hand with the five fingers. 
Method of administration 
-  This medicine is for use on the skin only.  
-  Do not apply to skin surfaces other than the ones instructed by your doctor. The medicine should 
be used at the smallest skin area necessary. 
-  Wash your hands after applying this medicine, unless you are treating your hands. If someone 
applies this medicine to you, they should wash their hands after application. 
-  Avoid washing treated skin for at least 2 hours after application of Opzelura. 
Duration of use 
Your doctor will decide how long you should use the cream for. 
A minimum duration of 6 months is recommended but satisfactory treatment may require over 
12 months. If you achieve satisfactory repigmentation of treated areas, consult your doctor to discuss if 
treatment of those areas could be stopped. Consult your doctor if you experience loss of 
repigmentation after stopping treatment. 
Do not use more than two 100 gram tubes a month.

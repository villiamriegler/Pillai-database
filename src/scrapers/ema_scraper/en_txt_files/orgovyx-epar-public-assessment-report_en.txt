2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The applied indication for Orgovyx (relugolix) is: 
“Orgovyx is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist indicated for the treatment 
of adult patients with advanced prostate cancer.” 
‘Advanced’ prostate cancer is generally regarded to be cancer that has spread from the prostate to 
other parts of the body, i.e. metastasized disease (including non-regional lymph node metastasis), and 
that is beyond curation. ‘Locally advanced’ prostate cancer, in contrast, is defined as ‘cT3-4 or cN+’, 
i.e. disease where the tumour extends through the prostatic capsule (T3) or is fixed or invades 
adjacent structures other than seminal vesicles (T4); and disease with regional lymph node metastasis 
(N+). Patients with locally advanced prostate cancer normally are treated with curative intent (2021 
EAU Guidelines on prostate cancer; 2020 ESMO Prostate cancer guidelines). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men worldwide, with over 1.2 million cases and 
358,000 deaths annually (Bray et al. 2018). While prostate cancer remains largely a disease diagnosed 
in men over 65 years of age, screening (based on serum levels of prostate-specific antigen [PSA]) has 
increased the rate of diagnosis among men in their 40s and 50s (Kimura and Egawa 2018). 
Genetic and acquired factors (age, ethnicity, and possibly dietary) are the most important known 
prostate cancer risk factors (Rawla 2019). Overall survival rates in localized disease are very high, but 
these rates decrease dramatically for advanced and metastatic disease, with a 5-year survival rate 
ranging from 26% to 30% (Steele et al. 2017; Ritch and Cookson 2018). Patients with metastatic 
prostate cancer have a high risk of life-threatening complications that increase with time, including 
skeletal-related events such as spinal cord compression, vertebral collapse, and pathological fractures 
(Auclerc et al. 2000; McMurtry and McMurtry 2003). Furthermore, patients with advanced prostate 
cancer are at a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular disease than men of the same age without 
prostate cancer (Keating et al. 2010a; Moustsen et al. 2019). Patients with prostate cancer without 
androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) exposure have a baseline higher risk of developing cardiovascular 
disease and this risk has been shown to increase with the use of GnRH receptor agonists (Keating et 
al. 2010b). Improvement in treatment and earlier diagnosis with PSA testing have resulted in fewer 
patients dying from prostate cancer and instead, patients with prostate cancer have a higher risk of 
non-cancer related mortality. Cardiovascular disease is the most common non cancer cause of death 
for men with prostate cancer (Satariano et al. 1998; Bhatia et al. 2016). 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Already in 1941, Huggins and Hodges proposed that prostate cancer growth was driven by androgens 
after observing the benefits of castration in men with prostate cancer (Huggins et al. 1941). Today, 
evidence-based treatment guidelines recommend androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with medical 
castration for the treatment of patients with prostate cancer if they are deemed to have advanced 
disease, are at significant risk of progressive disease and/or death, or in combination with radiotherapy

for intermediate- or high-risk localized disease (Parker et al. 2015; Mottet et al. 2017; Mohler and 
Antonarakis 2019). 
Understanding the physiologic control of testosterone secretion is the basis for the justification of the 
use of GnRH receptor agonists or antagonists to cause medical androgen deprivation. 
Endogenous GnRH secreted from the hypothalamus binds to GnRH receptors located on gonadotropin 
neurons in the anterior pituitary, stimulating synthesis and secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and 
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary. Both LH and FSH act on receptors in the 
testes. Luteinizing hormone acts on the Leydig cells to increase testosterone production from 
cholesterol. Testosterone self-regulates its secretion by providing negative feedback. High testosterone 
concentrations in the blood lead the hypothalamus to suppress GnRH secretion and make the anterior 
pituitary less responsive to stimulation by GnRH. 
When the GnRH pathway was initially discovered, development of an antagonist proved difficult 
(Crawford and Hou 2009). GnRH agonists (e.g., leuprolide) became the mainstay of medical androgen 
deprivation once it was understood that chronic stimulation of the pathway resulted in desensitization 
and down regulation of the LH gonadal axis (Mcleod 2003; Sharifi et al. 2005). Therefore, GnRH 
agonists initially stimulate the release of LH and FSH. Continuous stimulation leads to desensitization 
and subsequent suppression of LH and, to a lesser extent, FSH release. The decrease in LH results in a 
marked reduction of systemic testosterone concentrations. 
One major disadvantage of using an agonist to suppress testosterone is the initial stimulation (flare) of 
the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis that occurs prior to desensitization, lasting 1 to 3 weeks. This 
results in a rise in LH, a testosterone surge and, in some patients, an increase in clinical symptoms 
including bone pain, spinal cord compression, pathologic fracture, bladder outlet obstruction, and even 
death (Oh et al. 2010; Eligard USPI 2019; Eligard SmPC 2020). Estimated rates of clinical disease flare 
associated with GnRH receptor agonists range between 4% and 63% (Mahler 1993; Bubley 2001). The 
initial clinical flare response may be managed with simultaneous antiandrogen administration, such as 
bicalutamide (Thompson 2001), often called combined androgen blockade. However, use of 
bicalutamide has been associated with hepatotoxicity (requiring monitoring of serum transaminase 
levels) and gynecomastia (Casodex SmPC 2020; Casodex USPI 2017). 
Men with prostate cancer have a baseline higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease, and this risk 
increases with the use of GnRH receptor agonists (Keating et al. 2010b). Studies have also found a 
higher risk of major cardiovascular events in patients with prostate cancer treated with GnRH receptor 
agonists compared with GnRH receptor antagonists, particularly in men with pre-existing 
cardiovascular disease (Saigal et al. 2007; Margel et al. 2019), and a multidisciplinary task force that 
provided scientific advice on the topic (Levine et al. 2010). 
Degarelix (Firmagon) is currently the only GnRH antagonist approved for the treatment of prostate 
cancer. Degarelix, administered by monthly depot injection, achieves medical castration and a PSA 
response within the first 1 to 2 weeks of administration with no initial agonist activity and no clinical 
flare (Firmagon SmPC; Firmagon USPI 2020), and therefore, does not require combined androgen 
blockade. Use of degarelix in the clinical setting has been limited likely due to the rate of injection site 
reactions (44%) with monthly injections, which is significantly higher than that with leuprolide (< 1%) 
administered every 3 to 6 months (Sciarra et al. 2016). Degarelix requires a large injection volume (4 
mL) compared with leuprolide (0.375 mL for the 22.5 mg 3 month depot injection) (Doehn 2009). 
Regarding cardiovascular risks, the Firmagon SmPC carries a general warning and precaution for 
cardiovascular risk associated with androgen deprivation therapy without specific cardiovascular risk 
associated with degarelix (Firmagon SmPC).

Current androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) options, including GnRH receptor agonists and degarelix, 
are only available in injectable depot formulations and testosterone suppression may persist for 
months following discontinuation of therapy, prolonging the safety concerns and symptoms associated 
with therapy (Nascimento et al. 2019). The probability and time to return of serum testosterone 
concentrations to greater than castrate levels are highly variable and can depend on a number of 
factors, including ADT duration and the patient’s age (Bong et al. 2008). Persistently low testosterone 
concentrations are associated with a wide variety of adverse events, and an additional disadvantage of 
this protracted or even failed return of testosterone concentrations to above castrate levels with 
injectable depot formulations, is the inability to stop the treatment effect rapidly. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Clinical manifestations of prostate cancer are frequently absent at the time of diagnosis. The clinical 
behaviour of prostate cancer ranges from a screen detected asymptomatic, microscopic, well 
differentiated tumour that may never become clinically significant to the rarer screen detected or 
clinically symptomatic aggressive, high-grade cancer that causes metastases, morbidity, and death. At 
the time of diagnosis, 78 percent of patients have localized cancer, regional lymph node involvement is 
present in 12 percent, and 6 percent have distant metastases (UpToDate, accessed 12-Apr-2021). 
Population-based PSA screening of men for prostate cancer reduces prostate cancer mortality at the 
expense of overdiagnosis and overtreatment and is not recommended (2020 ESMO Prostate cancer 
guidelines). 
2.1.5.  Management 
If prostate cancer is diagnosed at a stage where it is confined to the prostate gland, it is generally 
treated by active surveillance, surgical prostatectomy, or with radiation. Often, prostatectomy or 
radiation is successful in curing men of their disease (Widmark et al. 2009; Bill-Axelson et al. 2011; 
Warde et al. 2011). Men whose disease progresses after prostatectomy or radiation are defined as 
having advanced prostate cancer. In the past, advanced prostate cancer was defined as disease that 
has metastasized beyond the prostate and pelvic lymph nodes and was considered incurable 
(Crawford 1994). Accumulated research and evidence have expanded the definition of advanced 
prostate cancer to encompass patients with significant risk of disease progression and/or death (Moul 
et al. 2000; D’Amico et al. 2003). Prostate-specific antigen relapse represents the earliest sign of 
advanced disease and is an indication of residual tumour (Yu et al. 1995; Pound et al. 1997). 
Approximately 40% of men who receive localized treatment will experience PSA relapse, or rising PSA 
levels after initial therapy, and represent the most common form of advanced prostate cancer (Moul 
2000; Moul et al. 2002, 2004).  
ADT with radiotherapy is established as an appropriate and effective treatment option for most men 
with newly diagnosed intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer (NCCN 2020). Both the European 
and United States (US) clinical practice guidelines suggest that 4 to 6 months of ADT may be sufficient 
for patients with intermediate-risk disease, whereas patients with high-risk advanced, localized disease 
are more likely to benefit from prolonged neoadjuvant/adjuvant ADT (18 to 36 months) with 
radiotherapy (Parker et al. 2015; Mottet et al. 2017; Bekelman et al. 2018; Sanda et al. 2018; Mohler 
and Antonarakis 2019). Meta-analyses have shown benefit from both short and long courses of ADT 
(Bria et al. 2009; Schmidt-Hansen et al. 2014). 
ADT is the foundational therapy for the treatment of patients with advanced prostate cancer (Parker et 
al. 2015; Attard et al. 2016). Additionally, when there is progression of the disease, ADT remains the 
backbone of treatment to which other treatment options are added (Mohler and Antonarakis 2019). 
Assessment report  
EMA/218094/2022

Therefore, in patients with advanced prostate cancer, treatment is usually continued upon 
development of non-metastatic and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (Mohler and 
Antonarakis 2019). 
Current, standard of care treatment with GnRH receptor agonists has known limitations, including an 
initial surge in testosterone with risk of clinical flare, increased risk of cardiovascular events, injection 
site reactions, and slow recovery of testosterone after discontinuation of treatment (depot 
formulation), among others. An injectable GnRH antagonist, degarelix, is approved for use but is only 
available as a monthly depot injection and is associated with a high frequency of injection site 
reactions and slow recovery of testosterone after discontinuation of treatment. Therefore, there is a 
need for improved treatment options for prostate cancer. Relugolix (previously known as TAK-385, T-
1331285, RVT-601, and MVT-601) is the first oral, nonpeptide, GnRH receptor antagonist developed 
for the treatment of patients with advanced prostate cancer. It has, indeed, been stated in scientific 
literature that the potential benefits of a daily-dosed oral agent could be multiple: ADT without an 
injectable depot (1) offers a more patient-friendly alternative with limited health care provider visits or 
procedures and no risk of local site reactions; (2) allows more flexible dosing and an option for prompt 
cessation of treatment due to intolerance or treatment-related side effects; and (3) eliminates the 
need for a lead-in antiandrogen to counteract potential testosterone flare induced with LHRH agonist-
based treatments (Sachdev et al. Eur Urol. 2020). However, oral ADT is not without its own 
drawbacks. Depot formulation can offer reliable, sustained plasma delivery without reliance on patient 
adherence, interactions with other oral medications, or gastrointestinal absorption. The bothersome 
side-effect profile of ADT may lead to earlier cessation or interruption of oral therapy by patients. 
Furthermore, while in studies good adherence to oral dosing of medications may be shown, real-life 
compliance to long-term daily dosing is likely to be less optimal. Lastly, it is unclear if more rapid 
testosterone recovery would make the drug effect of the same nominal duration as in trials using GnRH 
agonist depot injection-based treatment (Sachdev et al. Eur Urol. 2020), and a shorter duration of 
testosterone suppression with relugolix (due to faster testosterone recovery) could lead to 
undertreatment given that cancer control has been associated with the duration of testosterone 
suppression (Mahal et al. Eur Urol. 2020). In conclusion, whereas there is perhaps not a high unmet 
medical need for an oral formulation of a GnRH receptor agonist, it can be considered a valuable 
addition to the treatment armamentarium for advanced hormone-dependent prostate cancer. 
2.2.  About the product 
Relugolix is a non-peptide GnRH receptor antagonist that competitively binds to GnRH receptors in the 
anterior pituitary preventing native GnRH receptors from binding and signalling the secretion of 
luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Consequently, the production of 
testosterone from the testes is reduced.  
The initially applied indication was: 
Orgovyx is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist indicated for the treatment 
of adult patients with advanced prostate cancer. 
The finally approved indication was: 
Orgovyx is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced hormone-sensitive prostate 
cancer. 
Treatment with Orgovyx should be initiated with a loading dose of 360 mg (three tablets) on the first 
day, followed by a 120 mg (one tablet) dose taken once daily (QD) at approximately the same time 
each day.

Chapter 2 of Appendix 4 to the guideline on the evaluation of anticancer medicinal products in man 
contains condition-specific guidance on prostate cancer (EMA/CHMP/703715/2012 Rev. 2). In the 
section on therapy for metastatic disease (hormone-naïve), it is stated that for medicinal products 
aiming at achieving medical castration, it is sufficient to convincingly demonstrate the achievement 
and maintenance of castrate levels of testosterone in the absence of breakthroughs and micro-surges. 
It is also stated that if the aim is to achieve “surgical level” of castration, 20 ng/dL and below, clinical 
benefit should be demonstrated in a randomized trial vs. standard therapy (target 50 ng/dL and below) 
if the benefit of a lower serum testosterone target level cannot be demonstrated by other means. 
2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as a film-coated tablet containing 120 mg relugolix as active 
substance.  
Other ingredients are: mannitol (E421), sodium starch glycolate (E468), hydroxypropyl cellulose 
(E463), magnesium stearate (E572), hypromellose (E464), titanium dioxide (E171), iron oxide red 
(E172) and carnauba wax (E903). 
The product is available in bottles. Each high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle contains 30 film-
coated tablets and a desiccant and is closed with a child-resistant induction seal polypropylene (PP) 
cap, as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.4.2.  Active substance – Relugolix- 
General information 
The chemical name of relugolix is N-(4-{1-[(2,6-difluorophenyl)methyl]-5-[(dimethyl-amino)methyl]-
3-(6-methoxypyridazin-3-yl)-2,4-dioxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-6-yl}phenyl)-N’-
methoxyurea corresponding to the molecular formula C29H27F2N7O5S. It has a molecular mass of 
623.63 g/mol and the following structure, shown in Figure 1: 
Figure 1: relugolix structure 
The chemical structure of relugolix was elucidated by a combination of infra-red spectroscopy (IR), 
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) including 1D (1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and DEPT-135) 
analysis and 2D (HMQC, DQF-COSY and HMBC) analysis, mass spectrometry, X-ray powder and single 
crystal diffractometry, as well as UV/Vis spectroscopy. 
The active substance is a white to off-white to slightly yellow solid; the solubility of relugolix decreases 
with an increase of pH and it is considered a BCS IV Class compound. 
Assessment report

Relugolix is slightly hygroscopic and requires no special protection from humidity during handling, 
shipping, or storage. 
Relugolix exhibits polymorphism. The results of polymorph screening study showed that relugolix has 
several solid forms. The form selected for development and commercial use is thermodynamically the 
most stable form under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The polymorphic forms of relugolix 
can be distinguished by XRPD and the proposed manufacturing process is capable of consistently 
producing the desired polymorph of relugolix. Relugolix is non-chiral molecule and does not contain 
E/Z-isomerism.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided and it was 
considered satisfactory.  
The manufacturing process consists of several synthetic steps and a purification by crystallisation step. 
The proposed sites manufacturing the active substance use identical routes of synthesis. The starting 
materials are acceptable and are controlled by suitable specifications. The intermediates are sufficiently 
controlled. In addition, acceptable specifications for reagents, solvents and other materials used in the 
synthesis have been provided, including a limit for a named impurity, as part of the control strategy for 
nitrosamines, as described under product specification of the finished product.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised. The information presented regarding potential 
impurities/degradation products controlled in the active substance is adequate. Overall, the defined 
control strategy is satisfactory. 
The manufacturing process has been developed using a combination of conventional univariate studies 
and elements of QbD such as risk assessment and design of experiment (DOE) studies. A risk analysis 
was performed using the failure mode effect analysis (FMEA) method in order to define critical process 
steps and critical process parameters (CPPs) that may have an influence on the active substance 
quality attributes. The risk identification was based on the process knowledge and sound scientific 
judgement. No design space has been claimed. The CPPs have been adequately identified and the 
critical steps of the process were identified and are controlled by justified and appropriate in-process 
controls.  
Relugolix is packed in two sealed, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bags; desiccant may be placed 
outside the primary packaging. Then, the double-LDPE bagged material is placed in either an 
aluminum-laminated bag before packaging in a secondary container or an aluminum-lined fibre drum 
or equivalent secondary container. The primary packing material complies with the EC directive 
2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identification (IR, HPLC, UV), particle 
size (laser light diffraction), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), residual 
solvents (GC) and water content (Ph. Eur.). 
The specification limits for impurities/degradation products and residual solvents, are in accordance 
with the requirements of ICH guidelines Q3A and Q3C. All solvents used throughout the entire 
Assessment report  
EMA/218094/2022  
Page 18/176 
 
 
 
synthetic process, including those employed prior to the starting material, are routinely controlled in 
the specification and specified at levels in-line with the ICH Q3C thresholds.  
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  non-compendial  methods 
appropriately  validated  in  accordance  with  the  ICH  guidelines.  Satisfactory  information  regarding  the 
reference standards used has been presented.  
Batch analysis data from three registration batches, ten process validation batches, pilot-scale, GMP, 
and engineering batches are provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from 
batch to batch.  
Stability 
Stability data from three primary batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturers stored 
for up to 36 months under long term conditions (25°C / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions (40°C / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
The following parameters were tested: appearance, crystal form (PXRD), identification by IR, 
identification by UV, related substance, water and assay. Storage at the accelerated stability condition, 
up to 6 months, showed no change for the same stability-indicating and quality parameters. Slight 
increases in two specified impurities were observed but the results remain conform. The total related 
substances values remained below the specification limit and all tested parameters were within the 
specifications.   
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. During exposure, the active substance becomes yellowish white. 
There is also an increase in unspecified related substances and total related substances. These changes 
are not observed during long-term or accelerated stability conditions. Based on the results, the active 
substance is packaged in an aluminum-laminated bag or aluminum-lined fiber drums that prevents 
exposure to light. 
In addition, stressed stability studies were conducted for related substances on samples of relugolix 
active substance from one manufacture exposed to 50°C, 60°C, and 25°C/93% RH storage conditions 
and durations for up to 3 months, 2 months, and 3 months, respectively. The related substances 
method was shown to be stability indicating. There was no degradation observed in relugolix active 
substance. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months stored in the 
proposed packaging without storage restriction. 
2.4.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Orgovyx (REL) 120 mg tablets are light red, almond-shaped, film-coated, immediate-release tablets 
debossed with “R” on one side and “120” on the other side. The dimension of the tablet is approximate 
10.7 mm x 7.5 mm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/218094/2022

The finished product is indicated for use in male adults (18 years and older). No special considerations 
regarding use in the paediatric population (e.g. size of capsules, palatability,) are necessary. No 
overage is used. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards with the exception of iron oxide red which complies with USP-NF. There are no novel 
excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of 
the SmPC and in paragraph 2.4.1 of this report. 
Pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements. The quality target product 
profile (QTPP) was defined as an immediate release product designed to disintegrate and dissolve 
rapidly under the physiological conditions in the stomach, that meets compendial and other relevant 
quality standards. The QTPP was based on formulation developed for clinical studies, manufacturing 
process considerations and the properties of the active substance; QTPP and the critical quality 
attributes have been described.  
The formulation development has been provided with regards to selection of excipients and proposed 
amounts. The relugolix active substance solid form selected for clinical and commercial manufacturing 
of the film-coated tablets is thermodynamically stable. The particle size distribution of the active 
substance used in the development phase of the finished product is used for the commercial product.  
The formulation used during the pivotal Phase 3 clinical studies is the same as that intended for 
marketing. 
The discriminatory power of the QC dissolution method was demonstrated. The manufacturing 
development has been evaluated through the use of risk assessment and design of experiments to 
identify the critical process parameters and areas of process optimisation. The risk identification was 
based on the prior knowledge of products with similar formulations and manufacturing processes as 
well as on the experience from formulation development, process design and scale-up studies. Based 
on these experiments, process target values and acceptable ranges were established. No design space 
is claimed. The critical process parameters have been adequately identified. 
The finished product is packaged in high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with desiccant and a 
polypropylene (PP) child-resistant induction seal cap. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process has been described. The process is considered to be a standard 
manufacturing process. Storage times of intermediates during the manufacturing process are declared 
and acceptable. 
Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of 
dosage form: appearance (visual inspection), identification (UV and HPLC), assay (HPLC), related 
substances (HPLC), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), content uniformity (Ph. Eur.), water content (Karl-Fisher, 
Ph. Eur.) and microbial quality (Ph. Eur.).  
The proposed limits for specified impurities, as well as unspecified impurities are in-line with ICH Q3B 
and acceptable. Impurities controlled above the ICH qualification threshold and were qualified. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/218094/2022  
Page 20/176 
 
 
 
 
proposed impurity levels in the finished product are acceptable from a safety point of view and process 
capabilities.  
The limit for dissolution is in line with the general considerations in the Reflection Paper (RP) on the 
Dissolution Specification for Generic Solid Oral Immediate Release Products with Systemic Action 
(EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/336031/2017) and is considered acceptable. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data 
using a validated ICP-MS method was provided, demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity 
was not detected above 30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment and the presented 
batch data it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls. The 
information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory.  
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product 
has been performed (as requested) considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the 
“Questions and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the 
Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal 
products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation 
EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). To 
evaluate the nitrosamine risk in the finished product upon storage, a screening of nitrosamines was 
conducted. In view of the indication, the finished product falls within the scope of ICH S9, hence, 
nitrosamine impurities should be controlled according to ICH Q3A(R2) and ICH Q3B(R2) guidelines. 
Taking into consideration that NDMA was detected below 10% of the acceptable intake for NDMA, 
absence of nitrosamines is considered adequately demonstrated.  
Based on the information provided, it is accepted that there is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the 
active substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no specific control measures are deemed 
necessary. 
The finished product is released on the market based on the release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for five commercial scale batches of the finished product confirming 
the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from commercial scale batches of finished product stored for up to 36 months under long 
term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and intermediate conditions (30 ºC / 65% RH) for up to 6 months 
under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The 
batches of finished product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the 
primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested in line with the shelf-life specifications. The analytical procedures used are 
stability indicating. The finished product is generally very stable when stored in the proposed container 
closure system and no general trends or signs of degradation are observable. No change in dissolution, 
water content and assay is noticed for the time-frame covered so far under all storage conditions. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/218094/2022  
Page 21/176 
 
 
 
stability of the polymorphic form in the finished product was investigated during the stability studies 
and no conversion of the polymorphic form is observed.  
In addition, one batch of the finished product was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on 
Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. The finished product is photo-stable as it 
did not show signs of degradation after exposure to light without the protection of the primary 
packaging material. 
One batch of the finished product was exposed to the forced degradation conditions of acid, base, 
oxidative, light plus moisture and heat plus moisture. Results confirmed the suitability of the assay and 
purity methods to separate and quantify relugolix and potential degradation products and to confirm 
that the methods are stability indicating. 
An in-use, open-dish, stability study under ambient conditions was performed on one batch of the 
finished product. The samples were tested before and after 28 days. No difference in any of the tested 
quality attributes is observable. Based on these results, no in-use shelf life for the HDPE containers 
after opening is considered acceptable. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months, without any special storage 
conditions, as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner.  The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.4.6.  Recommendations for future quality development   
Not applicable. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The Fixed Dose Combination product of relugolix, 17β-oestradiol (E2) and norethisterone (NETA), 
called Ryeqo, was submitted for evaluation by the same Applicant in the MAA procedure 
EMEA/H/C/005267/0000 and has been approved. As no new non-clinical studies were supplied, the 
non-clinical assessment of relugolix from the previous procedure is displayed below but it should be

noted that for the current indication a three-fold higher human clinical dose (120 vs 40 mg QD) is used 
and where needed the text has been adapted. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro – GnRH receptor binding 
Relugolix showed a high affinity for human and for the monkey GnRH receptor with IC50 value of 0.12 
nmol/L and 0.15 nmol/L, respectively. The binding affinity of relugolix for rat GnRH receptor was much 
lower, with IC50 values of 2,900 nmol/L. 
In the presence of 40% FBS (fetal bovine serum), binding affinity of relugolix for human GnRH 
receptor was approximately 3-fold lower than that in the absence of FBS with IC50 value of 0.33 
nmol/L. In contrast, GnRH, cetrorelix- a peptide GnRH antagonist - and TAP-144 – a peptide GnRH 
agonist - showed approximately the same affinities for GnRH receptors in the presence and absence of 
40% FBS. But in either case, this affinity was lower than that of relugolix for human and monkey GnRH 
receptor in the presence of 40% FBS. 
These results suggest that binding affinity of relugolix for human and monkey GnRH receptors is highly 
species-specific and is ~3-fold lower in the presence of serum, which is related to relugolix protein 
binding.  
In vitro – functional effects on GnRH 
The antagonistic effect of relugolix and cetrorelix was examined on CHO cells expressing human GnRH 
receptors. These compounds inhibited GnRH-induced 3H-arachidonic acid release in a dose-dependent 
manner. IC50 values were 0.32 and 0.67 nmol/L, and IC90 values were 2.6 and 4.6 nmol/L for TAK-
385 and cetrorelix respectively. Relugolix being approximately 2-fold more potent than cetrorelix. 
The antagonistic effect of these compounds in the presence of 40% human plasma was also 
determined. IC50 values were 1.6 and 4.5 nmol/L, and IC90 values were 18 and 75 nmol/L for 
relugolix and cetrorelix and respectively. IC50 values and IC90 values for relugolix were approximately 
3-fold and 4-fold more potent with regard to antagonistic activity compared to cetrorelix in the 
presence of human serum. These data suggest that relugolix might show a potent GnRH antagonistic 
effect in human. 
Relugolix showed an inhibitory effect on GnRH - induced arachidonic acid release from CHO cells 
expressing monkey GnRH receptors in a dose-dependent manner. Relugolix had a potent GnRH 
antagonistic effect even in the presence of 40% monkey plasma. These data suggest that relugolix 
would show a potent antagonistic activity in monkey models in vivo, providing further support for the 
in vivo study in monkey.  
In vivo – human GnRH knock-in mice 
As relugolix has only low affinity for the mouse GnRH receptor, a human GnRHR knock-in mice was 
generated, in which mouse GnRHR was replaced by human GnRHR, to evaluate the effect of relugolix 
on a hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. To clarify whether relugolix works as an antagonist for 
human GnRHR in vivo, the effect of chronic oral administration of relugolix on oestrous cycle, ovary 
and uterus weights, GnRHR mRNA expression in the pituitary, and bone density in female human 
GnRHR knock-in (KI) mice was examined. Also, the effect of oral administration of relugolix on the 
Assessment report

weight of reproductive organs and pituitary human GnRH receptor mRNA expression in male human 
GnRH receptor KI mice was evaluated.  
Relugolix (in 0.5% methylcellulose (MC) containing 6 mg/mL citric acid) was administered by oral 
gavage for 4 weeks at 30, 100, or 200 mg/kg BID in females and at 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg b.i.d. in males. 
For both females and males, two control groups were included in each study to receive 0.5% MC 
vehicle alone: intact (non-ovariectomized/non castrated) animals and ovariectomized/castrated 
animals.  
The intact female mice displayed normal oestrous cycles, whereas OVX mice showed di-oestrous stage 
throughout the study period. Oral administration of relugolix induced a constant di-oestrous phase at 
the minimum dose of 100 mg/kg, b.i.d. and significantly decreased the ovary and uterus weight 
suggesting that relugolix suppresses the secretion of LH and oestrogens. In addition, relugolix at 100 
mg/kg, b.i.d. also induced down-regulation of the GnRHR mRNA expression in the pituitary indicating 
that a non-peptide GnRH antagonist (relugolix), as well as a peptide GnRH antagonist (Cetrorelix), is 
able to down-regulate the expression of pituitary GnRHR mRNA. There were no differences in 
cancellous and cortical bone density between intact, OVX and each treatment group. These results 
indicate that relugolix has suppressive effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in female 
human GnRHR knock-in mice and suggest that relugolix could work as an oral antagonist for human 
GnRHR in vivo. 
Significant decreases in ventral prostate weight, seminal vesicle weight, and pituitary human GnRH 
mRNA expressions were observed in castrated male mice. Oral administration of relugolix at doses 
higher than or equal to 3 mg/kg significantly decreased the ventral prostates and seminal vesicles 
weight. Furthermore, the effect of relugolix at a dose of 10 mg/kg on the weight of ventral prostates 
and seminal vesicles was similar to that of castration. These data suggest that relugolix would strongly 
reduce serum testosterone levels in human GnRH receptor KI mice. Relugolix at doses higher than 10 
mg/kg, significantly decreased the human GnRH receptor mRNA expression in pituitaries. This 
suggests that relugolix, which is a non-peptide GnRH receptor antagonist would work as a GnRH 
receptor down-regulator in KI mice pituitaries such as is observed for peptide GnRH receptor 
antagonist cetrorelix in male rats. Our data indicate that relugolix has a suppressive effect on the 
hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis in male human GnRH receptor KI mice. 
In female hGnRH KI mice relugolix act as an orally active GnRH antagonist and suppresses the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, suggesting that relugolix could therefore potentially be efficacious 
for treatment of reproductive disorders such as endometriosis and uterine leiomyoma. In male hGnRH 
KI mice, relugolix suppressed the weight of ventral prostates and seminal vesicles, and pituitary 
human GnRH receptor mRNA in male human GnRH receptor KI mice, suggesting that relugolix could 
have the potential to be efficacious for treatment of androgen dependent disorders such as prostate 
cancer by suppressing a hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis. It is remarkable that an efficacious dose 
in male hGnRH KI mice is approximately ten times lower than an efficacious dose in female hGnRH KI 
mice.  One of the primary effects of antagonism of the GnRH receptor, decreases in LH and FSH was 
not addressed in these studies.  
In vivo – castrated monkeys 
Castrated monkeys (3 per dose group) were treated with relugolix at a single dose of 0.1, 0.3, 1.0 or 
3.0 mg/kg. Plasma was collected pre-treatment (0h) and 1, 2, 4, 8, 24 and 48 hours post treatment. 
Testosterone levels were determined using mouse testicular cells that were incubated with the monkey 
plasma. The corresponding LH concentrations in the samples were calculated by logistic regression 
analysis. The LH levels seem quite variable as for instance for one out of the three monkeys in the 0.3 
mg/kg dose group deviating from the other two and one animal in the 1 mg/kg group seems to deviate 
from the other two animals in the same group. However, this is regarded inherent to the assay. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/218094/2022  
Page 24/176 
 
 
 
results show that relugolix at doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg suppressed plasma LH levels in castrated 
cynomolgus monkeys with maximum suppression that continued for 24 and 48 hours after 
administration, respectively. In contrast, relugolix at doses of 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg did not show 
substantial suppression. Thus, this in vivo experiment indicates that relugolix is orally active and 
effective at dose of over 1 mg/kg in castrated cynomolgus monkeys. 
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Effects of relugolix on 134 MDSPS assays in Enzyme and Radioligand Binding Assays were investigated. 
Relugolix in primary screen assays was found to inhibit [3H]SR-49868 binding to tachykinin NK2 
receptors with the activity of 55% at 10 μmol/L. Relugolix had high affinity for the human GnRH 
receptor with an IC50 value of 0.12 nmol/L, which indicates that the affinity of relugolix to human GnRH 
receptor was ~83,000 times higher than that to tachykinin NK2 receptors. The results show that 
relugolix has a high specificity for the human GnRH receptor. As the steady state Cmax for relugolix in 
humans is 79.1 ng/mL, binding to the tachykinin NK2 receptor is not anticipated to occur in the clinic. 
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
Relugolix inhibited hERG potassium channel current by 3.4%, 20.5% and 78.5% at 0.3, 3 and 30 
µg/mL respectively and with an IC50 of 9.7 µg/mL (15.5 μM). This IC50 is approximately 123-fold 
higher than the mean total steady state Cmax of 79.1 ng/mL, reached upon administration of 120 mg 
relugolix once daily. This is regarded a sufficient large safety margin for hERG inhibition to occur in the 
clinic, especially since the unbound relugolix Cmax is even ~3-fold lower, resulting in an even higher 
safety margin.  
Relugolix was administered to telemetered male cynomolgus monkeys (n = 4) at single doses of 0, 30, 
100, or 300 mg/kg by oral gavage at 7-day intervals in a crossover manner. The no observed effect 
level (NOEL) for blood pressure and heart rate (changes in the systolic, diastolic, or mean blood 
pressures; heart rate; PR interval; or QRS duration) was 300 mg/kg and estimated to correlate with a 
mean Cmax of 10,400 ng/mL being approximately ~131-fold higher than the human Cmax (79.1 
ng/mL at a dose of 120 mg/kg/day). As QT and QTc prolongation was observed in monkeys upon 100 
mg/kg and 300 mg/kg single dose, the NOEL for QT/QTc interval prolongation was 30 mg/kg and 
estimated to correlate with a mean Cmax of 1740 ng/mL and approximately 22-fold higher than the 
human Cmax (79.1 ng/mL at a dose of 120 mg/kg/day). Relugolix did not prolong the QTcF interval in 
the clinical thorough QTc study at single doses up to 360 mg (mean Cmax 253 ng/mL). Therefore, the 
no effect level for QT prolongation in humans is at least ~3.2 fold higher than the mean total relugolix 
Cmax at steady state in humans associated with the anticipated clinical dose of 120 mg once daily 
(79.1 ng/mL).  
Relugolix was administered to male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 6/group) as a single oral dose via 
gavage (dose volume = 10 mL/kg) at dose levels of 0 (0.5% MC), 200, 600, or 2000 mg/kg. No acute 
CNS effects in male rats at doses ≤ 2000 mg/kg at any time point up to 24 hours post-dose estimated 
to correspond with a Cmax of 7544 ng/mL which is approximately 95-fold higher than the human 
Cmax (79.1 ng/mL at a dose of 120 mg/kg/day). 
Relugolix was administered to male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 8/group) as a single oral dose via 
gavage (dose volume = 10 mL/kg) at dose levels of 0 (0.5% MC), 200, 600, or 2000 mg/kg and 
respiratory function was evaluated using a whole-body plethysmography system measuring respiratory

rate, tidal volume, minute volume, enhanced pause [Penh] before and at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 22 hours post-
dose. Relugolix had no acute effects on the respiratory system in male rats at doses up to 2000 mg/kg 
for 22 hours post-dose estimated to correspond with a Cmax = 7544 ng/mL which is approximately 
95-fold higher than the human Cmax (79.1 ng/mL at a dose of 120 mg/kg/day). 
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been performed for relugolix. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption after single dose was investigated in rats and monkeys and after repeated dose in mice, 
rats, rabbits and monkeys. Tissue distribution was investigated in rats. Placental transfer and 
distribution to milk were investigated in rats. Metabolism was investigated in vitro and in vivo in rats 
and monkeys. Excretion was investigated in mass balance studies in rats (intact and bile-duct 
cannulated rats) and monkeys. 
Methods of analysis   
Validated methods were used for the toxicokinetic analyses in plasma of mice, rats, rabbits and 
monkeys. The validation was adequate regarding calibration, accuracy, precision, LLOQ, dilution 
integrity, matrix effect and stability. In the toxicokinetic studies, bioanalytical reports were provided. 
The calibration and QC samples met the criteria of the Guideline on bioanalytical method validation 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev 1 Corr 2). The methods used in the pharmacokinetic analyses 
were fit for purpose. 
Absorption 
Relugolix has moderate intrinsic permeability in Caco-2 cells. Relugolix is a substrate for P-gp but it is 
not a substrate for BCRP. 
After oral single dose administration, relugolix was absorbed rapidly in rats and monkeys (Tmax 1-3 
h). The exposure increased more than dose-proportionally in rats up to 100 mg/kg and monkeys up to 
20 mg/kg (maximally approximately 2-fold more than the increase in dose, based on AUC). In rats, 
relugolix was absorbed mainly from the small intestine, especially from the duodenum. Relugolix was 
absorbed via the portal route and not via the lymphatic route in rats. In monkeys, plasma exposure 
was considerably higher in fasted conditions than in fed conditions (Cmax 5-fold higher and AUC 21-
fold higher). Volume of distribution was 16 – 39 L/kg in rats and 20 L/kg in monkeys, which implies a 
wide distribution beyond the total body water. Absolute oral bioavailability was low in rats, but some 
variation was visible (ranging 9 – 25% based on relugolix in the single dose pharmacokinetic studies). 
In the excretion study in bile-duct cannulated rats, 37% of total radioactivity was excreted in bile and 
2.6% excreted in urine, indicating a bioavailability of approximately 40%. In monkeys, absolute oral 
bioavailability compared to IV administration was 6.9% at 1 mg/kg under fasted conditions. Estimated 
oral bioavailability in humans is 12%. Elimination half-life was 2-6 h in rats and 5-7 h in monkeys and 
60 h in humans. Clearance was 4.5 – 9.3 L/h/kg in rats and 2.8 L/h/kg in monkeys, which is 
comparable to, or slightly exceeding hepatic blood flow. Only males were used in the single dose 
pharmacokinetic studies. In the toxicokinetic studies, both sexes were investigated, and no clear 
gender difference was observed. Therefore, no relevant gender differences are expected in other 
aspects of the pharmacokinetics.

After multiple dose administration, relugolix concentrations in plasma increased more than dose-
proportionally at lower doses (mouse 10-100 mg/kg/day, rat 10-100 mg/kg/day, monkey 1.5-15 
mg/kg/day) and approximately dose-proportionally or less than dose proportionally (mouse) at higher 
doses. No clear gender effect was observed in mice, rats and monkeys. No significant accumulation 
was observed in monkeys and in mice, except in monkeys at the lowest dose of 1.5-5 mg/kg/day and 
in mice at the highest dose of 2000 mg/kg/day. In rats, accumulation was observed at all doses. In 
general, accumulation in rats was approximately 4-fold, except at the lowest dose (10 mg/kg/day, 
more than 10-fold). 
Distribution 
Plasma protein binding of relugolix was moderate in mice (80-83%), rats (74-76%), monkeys (57-
59%) and humans (68-71%) in the concentration range 0.05 – 5 µg/mL. Binding to human serum 
albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein combined was lower (38-44%) than binding in human plasma, 
showing that other proteins may also be involved. In vitro, relugolix had no relevant effect on plasma 
binding of highly bound compounds warfarin, ibuprofen, digoxin and propranolol. 
Blood/plasma ratio in rats was 1.5 and 1.3 in males and females respectively at 4 h after dosing. In 
vitro, relugolix-associated radioactivity distributed into blood cells of rats, monkeys and humans for 
45-49%, 57-59% and 46-41% respectively, which is a considerable proportion. 
Following single dose oral administration to rats, relugolix-associated radioactivity was widely 
distributed with the highest concentrations in pituitary (up to 133x and 58x plasma concentration in 
males and females respectively) thyroid gland (71x and 54x), liver (294x and 170x), adrenals (55x 
and 55x), kidney (54x and 63x) and GI tract. Maximum concentrations were found at 4-8 h after 
dosing, except for the GI tract, where maximum concentrations were found at 1 h after dosing. At 168 
h after dosing, concentrations were below the limit of quantitation or at trace levels in most tissues. 
Relugolix-associated radioactivity distributed similarly to pigmented and non-pigmented skin. Relugolix 
distributed to the eye, where it could still be found at 12 weeks after dosing. The potential for 
phototoxicity has been studied and no evidence of phototoxicity was found in mice. Low concentrations 
were found in the brain up to 24 h after dosing. Concentrations in brain were lower than or similar to 
concentrations in plasma.  
Relugolix-associated radioactivity passed the placenta and was found in foetal plasma and tissue in 
rats. Cmax in foetal plasma was approximately 10% of maternal Cmax. Relugolix-associated 
radioactivity distributed into the milk of lactating rats. Concentrations in milk were high compared to 
plasma (approximately 10-fold at 2 h after dosing, the time of the maximum concentration). At 48 h 
after dosing, still measurable concentrations could be found. The data show that relugolix and 
relugolix-associated material (e.g. radioactive relugolix metabolites) has the potential to accumulate in 
milk.  
Metabolism 
In vitro, the major compound found in microsomes of mice, rats, dogs, monkeys and humans was the 
parent compound. In the presence of NADPH, the main human metabolites were Metabolite-A and 
Metabolite-B. Metabolite A was also formed in monkeys, and to a minor extent also in dogs, mice and 
rats. Metabolite-B was also formed in mice and rats and only to a very low extent in monkeys and 
dogs. Other metabolites, T-1400567, T-1525140, UK-A and UK-C, were formed to a low extent. An 
unidentified metabolite UK-E is also mentioned. No quantitative data are given regarding the formation 
of this metabolite. However, since it was not formed in a previous study and it was also not mentioned 
in the in vivo studies, it is probably not formed in relevant quantities. In the absence of NADPH, T-
1525140 was formed in all species and the other metabolites only to a very low extent. In dog 
microsomes, relugolix underwent less metabolic turnover than in microsomes from the other species. 
Assessment report  
EMA/218094/2022  
Page 27/176 
 
 
 
Metabolite A was formed through O-demethylation by CYP3A4. Metabolite B was formed through 
hydroxylation by CYP2C8 and, to a low extent, by CYP2C19. Metabolite C was formed through N-
demethoxylation, but not by CYP enzymes. Metabolite-C was found in large amounts only in faeces and 
it was formed in incubations with human faecal homogenates, but not in autoclaved faecal samples 
and is therefore most likely formed by gut microflora. 
In vivo metabolism was investigated in rats and monkeys and humans. Unchanged relugolix was the 
most abundant component in the plasma. At the time of the maximal radioactivity concentration (2 h 
in rats and 4 h in monkeys), mainly unchanged relugolix was present at 99% of radioactivity in rats 
and at 86% in monkeys. In humans at 72 h, unchanged relugolix in plasma ranged from 42 to 68% of 
total radioactivity. Metabolite-A was found up to 8.7% in plasma of monkeys, whereas it was not found 
in plasma of rats. Metabolite-B was not found in plasma of rats or monkeys, but it was found in bile of 
rats. Metabolite-C was found up to 1.9% in plasma of rats and not in plasma of monkeys. Remaining 
radioactivity consisted of minor, unidentified components. Even though at later time points (at 6 h in 
rats and 24 h in monkeys) “other components” comprised up to 40% of radioactivity in plasma in rats 
and up to 77% in monkeys, in absolute sense this concerns only minor amounts. In humans, all 
metabolites in plasma, which could amount up to 58%, were separately present at < 5% of total 
radioactivity. There are therefore no major human metabolites that need to be covered in the non-
clinical species. Most of relugolix-related material was excreted as metabolites with unchanged 
relugolix accounting for ≤ 8.0% in excreta of rats and monkeys. In bile of rats, Metabolite-B was the 
major compound. Metabolite-C was the major component in faeces of rats (59% of dose), monkeys 
(45% of dose) and also humans (40% of dose). Since Metabolite-C was not present in plasma or only 
at very low levels, and it was also not formed in incubations with intestinal microsomes, it was 
probably formed by gut microflora. This was confirmed by inhibition of Metabolite-C formation by 
autoclaving human faecal homogenates or by treatment of these homogenates with antibiotics.  
Excretion 
Recovery in the excretion studies following a single oral dose to rats and monkeys was 93-100% of the 
dose. The major part of relugolix-related radioactivity was excreted via the faeces (92-96% in intact 
rats and orally-dosed monkeys). In rats, only a minor part was excreted via the urine (1.4-2.6%). In 
monkeys, the excretion via urine was more variable (4.9-22% after oral administration). In bile-duct 
cannulated rats, 37% of the dose was excreted via the bile 24 h after administration of [14C]-relugolix. 
In monkeys, a large part appears to be excreted via the bile (69% of dose was excreted via faeces 
after IV administration). Yet, a considerable part was excreted via the urine as well (24% after IV 
administration). In humans, the same pattern was observed as in rats (83% excreted in faeces and 
4.4% in urine). 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
In rats, a single IV dose of 90 mg/kg relugolix was lethal for all animals. The maximum tolerated single 
oral dose of relugolix in mice, rats and monkeys is at least 2000 mg/kg. 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
Although relugolix demonstrates a very low affinity for rodent GnRH receptors, mice and rats are 
appropriate models to evaluate potential chemical-based or off-target toxicologic effects of relugolix. 
Oral treatment of mice during 4 weeks with 2000 mg/kg/day resulted in necrosis of the renal tubules 
Assessment report  
EMA/218094/2022  
Page 28/176 
 
 
 
and increased incidence of tubular basophilia in both sexes. After 13 weeks, at 2000 mg/kg/day in 
mice, similar histopathology findings were found in kidneys, spleen, colon, cecum, and femur and 
sternum bone marrow and corresponding effects on kidney and spleen weights, as well as effects on 
red blood cell (RBC) parameters. In the spleen, minimal to mild increased extramedullary 
haematopoiesis was observed. The NOAEL based on these effects was 600 mg/kg/day which is 141-
fold higher than the intended human dose, based on AUC. 
In rats after an oral treatment of 2 weeks, foamy cell infiltration in the testis was observed in 2 males 
at 100 mg/kg/day and in all males at 300 mg/kg, findings associated with phospholipidosis (PLD). 
After 4 week treatment in rats, at 2000 mg/kg relugolix some animals died, the liver enzymes ALT and 
AST increased, the urine was cloudy, and in various tissues cytoplasmic vacuolization, foamy cell 
infiltration, increased tingible body macrophages and necrosis due to PLD were shown. At 300 mg/kg, 
PLD-related histopathology was shown already, like foamy cell infiltration in lung and testis, 
vacuolization of tubular epithelial cells in kidney, and increased tingible body macrophages in the 
mesenteric lymph nodes. After 13 week treatment, in rats at 1000 mg/kg one male died. Urine was 
cloudy and necrosis in several tissues due to PLD was seen. At ≥300 mg/kg (females) and ≥100 
mg/kg (males) signs of PLD were observed (cytoplasmic vacuolization and foamy cell infiltration in 
various tissues, increased tingible body macrophages in lymphoid tissues and bone marrow). After 26 
week treatment at 300 mg/kg, cloudy urine was observed sporadically in a few male and female rats. 
At ≥ 100 mg/kg males showed signs of PLD in testis. The prolongation of the dosing period of relugolix 
from 4 or 13 weeks to 26 weeks did not intensify PLD in rats to at least the dosage level of 300 mg/kg. 
Further, necrosis was not observed in these organs or tissues at this dose level.  
Based on the PLD findings of the 26 week study in rats, the NOAEL is 30 mg/kg for males and 100 
mg/kg for females, which is 3 times, respectively 11 times the intended human exposure. However, 
organ toxicity, adverse clinical signs, and mortality were not observed at the highest dose of 300 
mg/kg. The NOAEL for organ toxicity was therefore considered 300 mg/kg in both sexes and around 55 
times higher than the intended human exposure. In conclusion, rodent studies do not indicate off-
target toxic effects at intended human exposures. 
The cynomolgus monkey was selected as the non-rodent species because of the high sequence 
homology with the human GnRH receptor (97.5% compared to 92.1% in dog) and the similar affinity 
and potency at the GnRH receptor relative to dogs. When relugolix was administered by oral gavage to 
cynomolgus monkeys for 2 weeks, dark discoloration of the liver which corresponded histologically to 
bile plugs, pigmentation of the hepatocytes and sinusoidal cells, and single cell necrosis of the 
hepatocytes were noted at 100 mg/kg. Histopathology findings in the gastrointestinal tract (foamy cell 
infiltration in the duodenum and cecum, vacuolization of the parietal cells in the stomach) were noted 
in males at ≥ 40 mg/kg and females at 100 mg/kg. A supplementary 2-week study in cynomolgus 
monkeys was followed with three doses up to 15 mg/kg/day, which is 7.7 times higher than the 
intended human exposure, to investigate dosage levels not associated with PLD-related observations. 
However, in the first study no PLD-related observations were made at 20 mg/kg/day, so this second 
study was unnecessary and indeed, no relugolix-related effects were seen.  
In a 4-week oral gavage study in monkeys, increases in ALT/AST and histopathology findings in the 
liver were noted at 100 mg/kg/day. Findings of PLD (foamy cell infiltration in the submandibular and 
mesenteric lymph nodes and increased tingible body macrophages in several tissues) were observed at 
≥ 10 mg/kg/day. In a 39-week study, relugolix (1.5, 5, 15, or 50 mg/kg/day) was administered by 
oral gavage to cynomolgus monkeys followed by a 13-week recovery period. The major toxicologic 
finding was observed in the liver (primarily changes in clinical chemistry) at 50 mg/kg. At the end of 
the recovery period, there was an overall decrease in the incidence and/or severity of liver findings, 
indicating ongoing recovery, and full reversibility was observed for the changes of transaminase levels. 
Reversible changes in female sex organ weight were observed at 50 mg/kg; this finding was attributed 
Assessment report  
EMA/218094/2022  
Page 29/176 
 
 
 
to the mechanism of action (GnRH antagonism). PLD was observed in various organs, and the number 
of affected organs increased with dose, but no marked adverse toxicities were associated with PLD. 
Histopathology findings indicative of PLD (foam cell infiltration in the submandibular lymph node, 
increased tingible body macrophages, and vacuolization in parietal cells of the stomach) were observed 
in males and/or females at ≥ 5 mg/kg. The PLD-related findings showed evidence of recovery. The 
NOAEL based on PLD is 1.5 mg/kg/day in both sexes, which is 0.4-fold higher than the intended 
human exposure. The NOAEL for organ toxicity was 15 mg/kg in both sexes based on liver toxicity, 
which is 9.3-fold higher than the human intended dose. In conclusion, no serious toxic effects are 
shown in monkeys at clinical exposures of relugolix. 
In a phospholipidosis biomarker study in rats, 0, 30 and 1000 mg/kg/day was orally dosed for 28 days. 
The study evaluated the sensitivity of di-22:6-BMP as a biomarker for PLD following relugolix exposure. 
The biomarker di-22:6-BMP was measured in urine, serum, lungs, and testes. At 1000 mg/kg, light 
microscopy (mild foamy cell infiltrates in the lungs/lymph nodes), TEM (prominent multilamellar 
cytoplasmic bodies in lymphocytes), and di-22:6-BMP biomarker analysis (2- to 3-fold increase in 
urine, lungs, and testes) demonstrated relugolix-related changes indicative of PLD. At 30 mg/kg, no 
such effects were seen. Thus possibly, urinary di-22:6-BMP can serve as a potential biomarker for 
detection of PLD in rats exposed to relugolix. A clinical study with up to 120 mg relugolix QD for up to 
at least 24-weeks did not show meaningful alterations in di-22:6-BMP. This indicates that PLD is not 
likely to occur in patients at the intended dose. 
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
Relugolix was negative in a bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay, an in vitro chromosomal 
aberration assay, and in a rat in vivo micronucleus assay, indicating that relugolix does not present a 
genotoxic risk. 
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
There was no evidence of treatment-related effects on the incidence of any tumours or in the number 
of tumour bearing animals in mice administered relugolix up to 100 mg/kg and in rats administered 
relugolix up to 600 mg/kg for 2 years. Exposure margins are both more than 50 times the intended 
human exposure based on AUC. 
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Relugolix was administered to male and female rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day in a fertility and 
early embryonic development study. Relugolix had no adverse effects on the oestrous cycle in female 
rats up to 1000 mg/kg, and no adverse effects were noted on reproduction or early embryonic 
development. Only minor effects on food consumption and body weight were noted at the highest 
dose. However, given the low binding affinity of relugolix for rat GnRH receptors, the results provide an 
assessment of off-target effects of relugolix only. 
Based on literature (Nakata et al. 2014), the Applicant showed that in female human GnRH receptor 
knock-in mice, the suppressive effects of relugolix on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis at doses 
of ≥ 100 mg/kg twice daily, induced a constant di-oestrous phase, and caused decreases in both 
ovarian and uterine weights. Withdrawal of relugolix after 28 days resulted in recovery of female 
reproductive function from a completely suppressed state in approximately 5 days, followed by 
continuous oestrous phases for several days. Subsequently, the oestrous cycles and the weight of 
hormone-dependent organs almost recovered to normal within 14 days after drug withdrawal. In

monkeys (see repeat-dose study TAK-385/00144), decreases in the frequency in menses were 
observed at 50 mg/kg for up to 39 weeks where all females at 50 mg/kg did not have menses after 
Day 13, probably related to the pharmacologic effects of relugolix. Additionally, menses in female 
monkeys demonstrated a recovery tendency within 13 weeks after last treatment. In male human 
GnRH receptor knock-in mice, relugolix decreased ventral prostate and seminal vesicle weights in a 
dose-dependent manner from 3 to 10 mg/kg BID. The suppressive effects on ventral prostate weight 
and serum testosterone concentrations were reversible as there was a return to pre-dose levels within 
14 days following cessation of treatment; however, testis weight (~30 % to 40 % decrease) did not 
fully recover after 28 days. This lack of recovery may be due to incomplete recovery in cell number of 
the spermatogenic epithelium, which occupies a large component of testicular weight, during this 
period (Nakata et al. 2014). In conclusion, relugolix has inhibitory effects on the male (at low doses) 
and female (at high doses) reproductive system, based on its pharmacodynamic action, which is only 
partly reversible. 
As the current indication of prostate cancer is applicable to males only, the embryofoetal development 
studies are not relevant. However, a summary of the assessment is provided: In an embryofoetal 
development study in rats, relugolix was administered to pregnant animals on GDs 6 to 17 at doses up 
to 1000 mg/kg/day. Treatment-related lower body weight, suppression of body weight gain, and 
decreased food consumption were observed at various intervals of the administration period at 1000 
mg/kg, giving a NOAEL for maternal toxicity of 200 mg/kg. There were no relugolix-related changes in 
pregnancy status or foetal endpoints. The NOAEL for embryofoetal developmental toxicity was 1000 
mg/kg (exposure is 170 times the intended human dose) in this pharmaceutically unresponsive model. 
In an embryofoetal development dose range-finding study in the more relevant species rabbits, 
relugolix up to 1000 mg/kg was administered on GDs 6 to 18. Relugolix appeared very toxic for rabbits 
and on GD 12 to 15, all females at 1000 mg/kg died, and from 40 mg/kg on, there were no implants. 
Some females at 8 mg/kg lost entire litters (total resorptions) during the early phase of the dosing 
period. These changes are considered related to the pharmacological effects of relugolix. The frequency 
of skeletal variations at 8 mg/kg was high. In the pivotal study, rabbits were dosed much lower with 
0.3 to 9 mg/kg. At 9 mg/kg, total litter loss was observed in 7 of 20 animals and high post-
implantation loss rate, a significant decrease in live foetuses, and low foetal viability rate were noted. 
There were no abnormalities or variations in external, visceral, or skeletal observations. The NOAEL for 
embryofoetal developmental toxicity was 3 mg/kg, which is far below the relugolix exposure (AUC) at 
the proposed clinical dose.  
As the current indication of prostate cancer is applicable to males only, the pre- and postnatal 
development studies are not relevant. However, a summary of the assessment is provided: In a 
prenatal and postnatal development study in the pharmacologically unresponsive rat model, relugolix 
had no effect on maternal function in F0 dams, development in F1 pups/animals, reproductive function 
in F1 animals, and early embryonic development at exposures up to 1000 mg/kg. 
2.5.4.6.  Other toxicity studies 
The phototoxic potential of relugolix was evaluated in an in vitro phototoxicity neutral red uptake 
(NRU) assay using BALB/3T3 clone A31 cells, and relugolix elicited a phototoxic response. However, 
according to the ICH Guidance S10 on Photosafety Evaluation of Pharmaceuticals, a positive result in 
this test should not be regarded as indicative of a likely clinical phototoxic risk, but rather a flag for 
follow-up assessment. Hereafter, the Applicant performed an in vivo phototoxicity study (GLP) in 
hairless mice, and skin reactions indicative of phototoxicity were not observed in any of the mice at 
doses up to 2000 mg/kg followed by exposure of UV-radiation. Therefore, relugolix is considered not 
phototoxic.

2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
In vitro, relugolix binds to the GnRH receptor with IC50 value of 0.12 nmol/L and in the presence of 
serum with IC50 value of 0.33 nmol/L (approximately 3-fold lower affinity). The antagonistic effects of 
Assessment report  
EMA/218094/2022  
Page 33/176 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
relugolix and cetrorelix on CHO cells expressing human GnRH receptors was examined by measuring 
the GnRH-induced 3H-arachidonic acid release in a dose-dependent manner. The IC50 value was 0.32 
nmol/L (1.6 nmol/L in the presence of serum) and IC90 value was 2.6 nmol/L (18 nmol/L in the 
presence of serum) for relugolix.  
In female hGnRH KI mice relugolix act as an orally active GnRH antagonist and suppresses the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, suggesting that relugolix could therefore potentially be efficacious 
for treatment of reproductive disorders such as endometriosis and uterine leiomyoma. In male hGnRH 
KI mice, relugolix suppressed the weight of ventral prostates and seminal vesicles, and pituitary 
human GnRH receptor mRNA in male human GnRH receptor KI mice, suggesting that relugolix could 
have the potential to be efficacious for treatment of androgen dependent disorders such as prostate 
cancer by suppressing a hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis. It is remarkable that an efficacious dose 
in male hGnRH knock-in mice is approximately ten times lower than an efficacious dose in female 
hGnRH knock-in mice. Unexpectedly, two of the primary effects of antagonism of the GnRH receptor, 
i.e. decreases in LH and FSH, were not addressed in these studies. 
In addition, orally administered relugolix at doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg suppressed plasma LH levels in 
castrated cynomolgus monkeys with maximum suppression that continued for 24 and 48 hours after 
administration, respectively. In contrast, relugolix at doses of 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg did not show 
substantial suppression. Thus, this in vivo experiment indicates that relugolix is orally active and 
effective at a dose of ≥1 mg/kg in castrated cynomolgus monkeys. 
No secondary pharmacology or safety pharmacology effects are noted in vitro or in vivo in animals that 
would indicate for risks upon clinical use of relugolix.  
Pharmacokinetics 
The non-clinical pharmacokinetics have been studied adequately. 
Toxicology 
Relugolix is not toxic in rodents like mice and rats up to very high doses when administered orally, and 
the toxic effects shown at those very high doses are also off-target toxic effects, because relugolix has 
a very low affinity for rodent GnRH receptors. Relugolix in the cynomolgus monkey has a high affinity 
for the human GnRH receptor, and also shows effects at lower doses than in rodents, like on the liver, 
still with a large margin of exposure compared to humans. The only effect seen in monkeys at 
relatively low doses is phospholipidosis (PLD) in various organs with a low safety margin. But PLD is 
not considered a serious toxic effect, and also by use of a PLD-biomarker in humans with the normally 
intended dose of relugolix, no signs of PLD were shown. 
The Applicant clarified that the current product for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer is being 
developed under the ICH S9 guideline and that several studies have been conducted under the ICH M3 
guideline due to the development of a product for the treatment of uterine fibroids and endometriosis 
in women of childbearing age. In addition, reversibility data were provided supporting the reversibility 
of effects as observed in repeated toxicity studies of the cynomolgus monkey, which is the most 
sensitive species in contrast to rats and mice, for which relugolix had a weak affinity for the GnRH 
receptor. In rats and mice, toxicities are observed but at fairly high exposure levels compared to 
human exposure.  
No treatment-related effects on fertility, embryo-foetal development and pre-post-natal development 
were reported in rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day. As the rat is not a pharmacologically relevant 
species, these results are interpreted as an absence of off-target adverse effects on the parameters 
investigated in these studies. Relugolix may have adverse effects on male fertility due to its activity at 
GnRH receptors. In a published study in human male GnRH receptor knock-in mice, pharmacology-
Assessment report  
EMA/218094/2022  
Page 34/176 
 
 
 
related decreases in ventral prostate/testicular weight and testosterone concentrations were observed 
at ≥3 mg/kg/day. These effects were reversible, with the exception of the reduction in testicular 
weight, probably due to incomplete recovery of spermatogenic epithelial cell numbers. SmPC 5.3 
should be revised to remove the lack of a treatment-related effect on testicular weight in the 39-week 
monkey study, since histopathological assessment organs showed that most male animals were 
sexually immature at the end of treatment. In the embryo-foetal developmental toxicity study in 
rabbits, spontaneous abortions and embryonic lethality were reported in the absence of maternal 
toxicity at 9 mg/kg/day. The Applicant supplied as requested further justification of the contraceptive 
measure proposed in SPC 4.6 for treated male partners of women of child-bearing potential. This 
justification is based on a risk assessment estimating the theoretical systemic exposure in a female 
partner from seminal transfer of relugolix, which is conservative, and the possible risk of foetal harm. 
In spite of a safety ratio of 162 between exposure of rabbits at the no-observed effect level in the EFD 
study and predicted Cmax in females partners of treated male patients exposed via seminal fluid, the 
Applicant considers that a risk cannot be fully excluded and still recommends a contraception measure 
for male patients. Indeed, it is argued that the predicted Cmax value in female partners of male 
patients is similar to the IC50 value determined at human GnRH receptor. Therefore, given the potential 
serious adverse effects due to this inhibition, a warning for contraception in males is warranted. The 
proposed 2-week period of contraception use following cessation of relugolix therapy is consistent with 
5-times the elimination half-life.  
Relugolix has found to have no genotoxic or carcinogenic potential, however, the relevance of the rat 
and mouse carcinogenicity studies for human carcinogenic risk assessment is limited given the very 
low binding affinity of relugolix for rat and mouse GnRH receptors. The studies are only directed at off 
target effects. 
ERA 
Relugolix is not PBT, nor vPvB. No risk was identified for micro-organisms in the sewage treatment 
plant (STP), for the groundwater compartment and for the sediment compartment. A risk assessment 
for the terrestrial compartment was not triggered. A risk to the aquatic compartment was identified. 
This has been reflected in the SmPC section 5.3 and 6.6 including the statement that any unused 
medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Relugolix is a nonpeptide GnRH receptor antagonist that competitively binds to GnRH receptors in the 
anterior pituitary gland preventing native GnRH from binding and signalling the secretion of luteinizing 
hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Non-clinical data based on conventional studies 
reveal no special hazard for humans beyond those discussed above. It is not known whether relugolix 
or its metabolites are present in semen. Based on findings in animals and mechanism of action, if a 
patient engages in sexual intercourse with a woman of childbearing potential, effective contraception 
during treatment and for 2 weeks after the last dose of Orgovyx must be used. There is a limited 
amount of data from the use of relugolix in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown that 
exposure to relugolix in early pregnancy may increase the risk of early pregnancy loss. Based on the 
pharmacological effects, an adverse effect on pregnancy cannot be excluded. Results from nonclinical 
studies indicate that relugolix is excreted into the milk of lactating rats. No data are available regarding 
the presence of relugolix or its metabolites in human milk or its effect on the breast-fed infant. An 
effect on breast-feeding newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Based on findings in animals and 
mechanism of action, Orgovyx may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential (see SmPC 
section 4.6 and 5.3).

relugolix as monotherapy as well as the women’s health programs in uterine fibroids and endometriosis 
with relugolix combination therapy (relugolix 40 mg, estradiol 1 mg, and norethindrone acetate 0.5 
mg, see Ryeqo EPAR for more details). Therefore, both male and female participants were included in 
several clinical pharmacology studies. In addition, because dosing recommendations of relugolix for the 
prostate cancer indication is 120-mg once daily and for the women’s health indications is 40 mg once 
daily (in combination with estradiol and norethindrone acetate), some clinical pharmacology data 
generated with relugolix 40 mg support the prostate cancer indication. 
The clinical development program for Orgovyx included one (1) biopharmaceutics study and twelve 
(12) clinical pharmacology studies in healthy participants and patients with moderate and severe renal 
or mild and moderate hepatic impairment, and four (4) studies (one phase 1, two phase 2, and one 
phase 3) in men with prostate cancer, to support the marketing authorization application (MAA) of 
relugolix for the treatment of men with prostate cancer (Table 3). 
Additionally, a population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) model and a population pharmacokinetic/ 
pharmacodynamic (PopPK/PD) model were developed using data from two clinical pharmacology 
(phase 1), two phase 2, and one phase 3 studies. The PopPK model was developed to characterize the 
pharmacokinetics of relugolix and to identify demographic or physiological covariates that explain 
interindividual variability on the exposure to relugolix. The PopPK/PD model was used to characterize 
the relationship between relugolix exposure and testosterone concentrations, identify covariates that 
impact pharmacodynamic parameters, and explain interindividual variability in testosterone 
concentrations.

Analytical methods 
All bioanalytical methods for relugolix (and for testosterone) were validated as phase-appropriate in 
accordance with guideline documents and were shown to be accurate, precise, specific, sensitive, and 
reproducible. Interference testing was completed as necessary. Most methods have already been 
reflected in the Ryeqo procedure (EMEA/H/C/005267). 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
After oral administration, relugolix is rapidly absorbed, reaching maximum concentrations at 
approximately 2.25 hours post-dose, followed thereafter by a multiphasic decline (MVT-601-043). The 
terminal elimination half-life is 60.8 hours (TAK-385-1009). Upon once daily administration following a 
single loading dose of 320 or 360 mg on Day 1, steady state is achieved within 7 days (C27001, TB-
AK160108) (Table 4).

*** It should be noted that reported properties are based on the respective relugolix doses that were used in the clinical studies/data, which have not been adapted to the 
120 mg dose. 
Absorption  
After administration of a single 120-mg dose of relugolix in the fasted state, relugolix is rapidly 
absorbed with multiple peaks observed in the relugolix concentration-time profiles. The first mean 
Cmax1 of 35.34 ng/mL is reached at a median tmax1 of 2.25 hours (range 0.50 – 5.00 hours) and a 
second Cmax2 of 32.33 ng/mL is reached after a median tmax2 of 3.50 hours (range 2.00-5.00). After 
reaching Cmax, relugolix concentrations decline in a multi-phasic manner, initially with a rapid decrease 
in concentrations (between approximately 6 and 16 hours post-dose), followed by a slower decline 
(between approximately 12 and 24 hours post-dose) and subsequently by a slow terminal elimination 
phase characterized by a relatively flat slope (beginning at approximately 48 to 72 hours post-dose) 
with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 60.8 hours. However, the majority of the total 
exposure to relugolix occurs within the first 24 hours after administration with little contribution to the 
overall AUC from the terminal portion of the elimination phase (Figure 2). 
The estimated fraction absorbed is ~40% for a 80 mg dose based on the mass balance data, given 
that the preclinical data indicate that metabolite C can be formed in the intestinal flora (see below 
under Metabolism). As the absolute bioavailability at this dose was 11.6% (TAK-385-1009), there is a 
considerable first-pass effect. The absolute bioavailability of a single 120 mg oral dose of relugolix is 
estimated to be approximately 14% based on the greater than dose-proportional exposure of relugolix 
(calculated using the estimated dose effect on relative bioavailability [F1] in the PopPK model). 
Assessment report  
EMA/218094/2022  
Page 41/176 
 
 
 
 
Relugolix reaches an initial peak by 0.5 hours post-dose followed by one or more subsequent 
absorption peaks until 5 hours post-dose. Because no secondary peaks were observed following 
intravenous administration of relugolix, it seems unlikely that enterohepatic recirculation of relugolix 
plays a major role. The absorption of relugolix seems to be strongly mediated by intestinal P-gp, 
because the bioavailability of 20 mg relugolix increased 6.2-fold when co-administered with 
erythromycin, which is a  P-gp and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, whereas voriconazole (an inhibitor of 
CYP3A4) increased the exposure only 1.5-fold after a 40 mg relugolix dose.  
Results from the erythromycin interaction study MVT-601-054 (see Drug Interactions), testing the 
effect of erythromycin on the bioavailability of 40 mg and 120 mg relugolix, have revealed that due to 
saturation of intestinal P-gp the inhibition effect of relugolix on intestinal P-gp decreases as the dose of 
relugolix is increased.

Formulation development for relugolix 
Three relugolix formulations in multiple strengths (T2, T3, and T4B) were developed and administered 
in clinical studies supporting the prostate cancer indication. The 120-mg tablet strength of the T4B 
formulation is used in the pivotal phase 3 study. 
Food effects 
Concomitant intake of 120 mg relugolix (T4B) with a high-calorie, high-fat meal decreases the AUC0-∞ 
with 19% and Cmax with 21% (TAK-385_1010). In the pivotal phase 3 study in men with advanced 
prostate cancer (MVT-601-3201), relugolix was administered on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour 
before or 2 hours after a meal. In this context, the intake with a high-calorie, high-fat meal represents 
the worst-case scenario and it can be expected that the decrease in relugolix exposure is less than 
20%.

Distribution 
Relugolix is bound to plasma proteins for 68 – 71%, primarily to albumin and to a lesser extent to 
α1-acid glycoprotein, in addition to other plasma proteins. The exposure to total radioactivity in 
whole blood was lower compared with that in plasma, indicating limited distribution into red blood 
cells (mean whole blood-to-plasma ratio of 0.78). The value for apparent volume of distribution at 
steady state of approximately 3900 L indicates that relugolix distributes widely into tissues. 
Elimination 
Based on study TAK-385-1009, in which a single 80-mg dose of [14C]-relugolix was administered, total 
radioactivity in plasma was associated with a similar concentration-time profile with rapid absorption 
followed thereafter by a multi-phasic decline. The mean t1/2 associated with the terminal elimination 
phase based on radioactivity was estimated to be 226 hours as a result of the very slow (flat) 
elimination of total radioactivity, particularly after 72 hours post-dose. The slower elimination of 
radioactivity might be due to slow release of relugolix from tissues, but also might be caused by 
metabolites with slow elimination. 
The mean clearance after intravenous administration of an 80-µg dose of [14C]relugolix was 29.4 L/hr 
(from absolute bioavailability study TAK-385-1009). Mean terminal elimination half-life based on 
plasma concentrations for relugolix is approximately 60 hours and the mean effective half-live (t1/2, eff) 
is 25 hours. 
Metabolism 
In vitro metabolism 
Three main metabolites were identified in in vitro studies with relugolix. Metabolite A (CYP3A4) and -B 
(CYP2C8) were formed in human liver microsomes. Further phenotyping demonstrated that the CYP 
enzymes contributing to the overall hepatic oxidative metabolism of relugolix were CYP3A4/5 (45%) > 
CYP2C8 (37%) > CYP2C19 (< 1%). The remaining 18% was mediated by other CYP enzymes or 
unevaluated biotransformation pathways. Another main metabolite, Metabolite C in faeces, is formed 
by intestinal microflora and likely represents unabsorbed relugolix. 
In vivo metabolism in human subjects 
Metabolite-C was identified as the major metabolite in human faeces, representing approximately 40% 
of the total radioactive dose. Metabolite-C was detected only at low levels in human plasma, likely from 
absorption of trace amounts after formation in the intestine. 
Because Metabolite-A and Metabolite-B (combined) represent approximately 2.2% and 3.8% of total 
radioactivity in plasma in the 72-hour post-dose period after oral administration of a single 80-mg dose 
of [14C]-relugolix in the human ADME study (TAK-385-1009), CYP3A4/5 and CYP2C8-mediated 
metabolism of relugolix are thought to be relatively minor pathways of systemic clearance in vivo. 
The metabolic fate of relugolix is not entirely clear. Approximately half of the radioactivity in plasma, 
urine and faeces has not been identified, as 53% of radioactivity in plasma during first 72 hours after 
administration has been identified, 53% of radioactivity in urine and 56% of radioactivity in faeces, 
which is considerably lower than the 80% recommended in the guideline. However, multiple minor 
metabolites were detected in plasma, urine and faeces indicating that relugolix is extensively 
metabolised by various pathways. 
Based on the fraction absorbed of ~40% and an absolute bioavailability of 11.6%, there is a 
considerable first-pass effect. Of the fraction escaping the first-pass metabolism, 19% is eliminated as 
Assessment report  
EMA/218094/2022  
Page 43/176 
 
 
 
 
unchanged relugolix in the urine; hence, pre-systemic and systemic metabolism contribute 
approximately 70-80% to the elimination of an absorbed dose of relugolix.  
Excretion 
Recovery of radioactivity in the mass balance study was 87.1%, hence the collection period of 12 days 
is considered acceptable. The majority (82.7%) of radioactivity was recovered in faeces, with 
approximately 4.4% recovered in urine. 
Approximately 2.2% of the total radioactive dose of relugolix is excreted unchanged in the urine and, 
based on an absolute bioavailability of 11.6%, an estimated 19% of an absorbed dose (i.e. following 
pre-systemic clearance) is excreted unchanged in the urine and 80% is eliminated through metabolism 
by multiple minor metabolic pathways and/or biliary secretion of unchanged drug. Approximately 38% 
of the administered dose is excreted as metabolites (other than Metabolite-C) in the faeces and urine. 
Metabolite-C, which is formed by intestinal microflora, is the primary metabolite in faeces (50.6%) and 
further reflects non-absorbed drug. However, the continuous excretion of radioactivity in the faeces 
beyond 72 hours after administration indicates that a substantial part (at least 40%) of relugolix is 
being absorbed and suggests a reasonably high first-pass effect, because the absolute bioavailability 
was only 11.6%. 
Drug transporters 
Relugolix has moderate intrinsic permeability in Caco-2 cells compared to the low and high 
permeability controls used. Relugolix is a substrate for P-gp.  
As renal excretion of relugolix comprehends <25% of the absorbed fraction and as it is unlikely that 
enterohepatic recirculation contributes significantly to the exposure of relugolix, investigating if 
relugolix is a substrate for renal and/or bile transporters is considered not necessary. 
Results of in vitro transporter studies in OATP-expressing cells indicated that relugolix is not a 
substrate for the OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 hepatic uptake transporters.  
Dose proportionality and time dependency 
Dose proportionality 
Overall, the majority of the data demonstrate that the exposure to relugolix increases greater than 
dose-proportional after a single dose (60-360 mg) and at steady state after once dosing for 14 days 
(40-360 mg). The greater than dose-proportional increase in exposure to relugolix after a single dose 
is also supported by the PopPK model, wherein a covariate of 0.389 in the exponent was estimated for 
Dose ~ F1 in the dose range of 60 -160 mg.   
Accumulation ratio 
The accumulation of relugolix following once daily administration is approximately 2-fold; accumulation 
ratios for relugolix AUC0-τ were 2.07 to 2.21 and for Cmax were 1.52 to 1.80. The accumulation for 
relugolix upon administration of 120-mg doses once daily is expected to be the same as that observed 
for 80- and 180-mg doses once daily. However, this accumulation upon once daily dosing of the same 
dose is less relevant after a loading dose of 360 mg. 
After administration of 80-mg doses of relugolix once daily for 14 days, the mean t1/2, eff was 25 hours, 
indicating that the systemic exposure (in terms of AUC) to relugolix reduced by half in approximately 
24 hours. 
Attainment of steady state 
Assessment report  
EMA/218094/2022  
Page 44/176 
 
 
 
 
Steady state of relugolix is reached not later than 7 days when a once daily doses of 60-80 mg is 
administered with a loading dose. The time to steady state is also reached not later than 7 days when 
a loading dose of 360 mg is administered on day 1 followed by a once daily dose of 120 mg. 
Time dependency 
No results on AUC0-τ at steady state or AUC0-∞ after single dosing data, specifically at the 120 mg dose 
level, were available from the same study for assessment of time dependence. 
Trough relugolix concentrations as measured every 4 weeks during the Phase 3 study MVT-601-3201 
seem to be quite stable over time from 4 weeks until 48 weeks after dosing and indicate that the 
pharmacokinetics of relugolix is time independent for the 120 mg once daily dosing regimen. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Relugolix 120 mg showed within-subject variability of 55 to 85% for AUC, and even higher variability 
for Cmax, as determined from studies MVT-601-043 and TAK-385-1010. Relugolix can be considered a 
highly variable drug. Between-subject variability in exposure to relugolix after a single dose of 120 mg 
relugolix was also high, ranging from 80% to 130% for AUC higher and even for Cmax (studies MVT-
601-043 and TAK-385-1010). After multiple doses of 120 mg relugolix for 14 days, the between-
subject variability in exposure to relugolix ranged from 51% to 109% for AUC0-τ, 85% to 154% for 
Cmax and 43 to 88% for Ctrough (studies MVT-601-044, MVT-601-045 and MVT-601-3201). 
Variability of P-gp activity or expression level likely contributes to the high variability of relugolix, as 
the variability of relugolix decreased with >50% for C max and AUC0-∞ when relugolix was co-
administered with the P-gp and moderate CYP3A inhibitor erythromycin (studies TAK-385/CPH-010 and 
MVT-601-054). In line with this, the inter-subject variability in estimated mean plasma clearance (CL) 
of relugolix after intravenous administration was only 15% (study TAK-385_1009). 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
In general there is an overlap in ranges of exposures between healthy men and men with prostate 
cancer, and the bigger groups do not indicate major differences in pharmacokinetics of relugolix (Table 
5).

Special populations (Intrinsic Factors) 
The potential effects of intrinsic factors on exposure to relugolix, including demographic parameters 
(age, race, sex, body weight, renal impairment) were evaluated either in dedicated studies, by cross-
study comparisons, or with the population pharmacokinetic analysis.

PopPK analysis 
The selected clinical studies were appropriate to investigate the specified objectives of the population 
pharmacokinetic model. The pharmacokinetics of relugolix were best described by a three-
compartment model with first-order absorption with lag-time and first-order elimination. Parameters 
appeared to be estimated with reasonably high precision.  
A relatively large interindividual variability on several model parameters was identified, predominantly 
in the absorption phase (160% on Ka) and distribution phase (123% on Vc/F), even after inclusion of 
several covariates. The large IIV values for Ka and Vc/F seem to be in line with the large variation seen 
in absorption from individual relugolix plasma concentration-time profiles and the large variation in the 
trough concentrations in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies. The identified covariates are in line with a 
previously conducted population pharmacokinetic analysis for Ryeqo (EMEA/H/C/005267). Stage of 
cancer was tested as a covariate in a separate, additional analysis (see below). 
Body weight as a significant covariate on CL/F with the allometric exponent value of 0.32 was 
determined based on covariate evaluations for the pharmacokinetics of the analysis population, and 
was able to characterize the observed trend in CL with body weight within the dataset. This is 
acceptable as the primary purpose of the covariate analysis was to characterize the pharmacokinetics 
within the analysis population, not for purposes of extrapolation to lower or higher body weights, in 
which case a fixed exponent of 0.75 might have been considered. 
The standard goodness-of-fit plots, the prediction-corrected visual predictive checks of both the 
development dataset and validation dataset indicate no clear structural deviations.  
Using the final PopPK model simulations were done to predict the effects of covariates race and body 
weight on exposure to relugolix (in terms of model-predicted total exposure or trough concentrations 
at steady state [AUCss; Ctrough,ss]. Overall, the predicted collective effects of covariates race and body 
weight were relatively modest and well within the comparability bounds of (0.50 to 1.50) for clinically 
meaningful changes in exposure (AUC and Ctrough,ss) associated with the established safety and efficacy 
profile for relugolix (Figure 3).

Health status / Stage of cancer 
Neither health status (“healthy” and “prostate cancer patients”) nor stage of cancer, based on the 
Tumor-Node-Metastasis stages captured at baseline in each prostate cancer patient (“localized”, 
“locally advanced”, “metastatic”, “not classifiable”, and “missing”), were identified as a statistically 
significant covariate in the population PK and PK/PD analyses. A separate, additional covariate check 
was done for this.

Of the 1530 study participants from all clinical studies with relugolix pharmacokinetic data available, a 
total of 432 (28.2%) were 65-74 years of age, 307 (20.1%) were 75-84 years of age, and 39 (2.5%) 
were ≥ 85 years of age. 
No children (<18 yrs of age) have been dosed with relugolix so far.  
Race 
Black/African-American race was identified as a significant covariate in the PopPK model on the CL/F 
and Vc/F. Simulation for the pivotal phase 3 study MVT-601-3201 showed that Black/African American 
men had approximately 39% higher AUCss and 33% higher Ctrough,ss of relugolix compared with non-
Black/African American men. However, this effect was reduced in a simulated population of 10,000 
individuals to 26% and 16% increase in  AUCss and Ctrough,ss, respectively. 
Sex / gender 
There is no major difference in exposure to relugolix between men and women, according to the 
results of study TAK-385/CPH-010 wherein pharmacokinetic data were described separately for both 
sexes. 
Body weight 
Body weight was identified as a significant covariate on CL/F of relugolix in the final PopPK model. 
However, impact of body weight on relugolix AUCss and Ctrough,ss was small, with median differences < 
15% between patients above and below the median weight of 80 kg in the simulation of the pivotal 
phase 3 study MVT-601-3201. 
Renal impairment 
Based on the dedicated renal impairment studies with 40 mg relugolix, the exposure to relugolix 
(AUC0-t) increased 1.5-fold in subjects with moderate and 2.0-fold in subjects with severe renal 
function. The terminal t1/2 is not affected in the subjects with renal impairment and only 19% of the 
absorbed relugolix is excreted via the renal pathway. 
The effect of renal function (creatinine clearance) on the relugolix exposure (post-hoc estimates of 
AUCss and Ctrough,ss based on the PopPK model) in the pivotal phase 3 study MVT-601-3201 were 
analysed and quantified, where the actual dose of 120 mg was administered.  
In this study, 148 patients were included with moderate renal impairment, including 4 patients with 
baseline creatinine clearance values just below 30 ml/min (severe renal impairment). The results from 
the simulations using the phase 3 population confirm the results for the dedicated renal impairment 
studies with 40 mg relugolix, i.e. similar exposure in patients with mild renal impairment and 1.4-fold 
higher exposure in subjects with moderate renal impairment as compared to patients with normal renal 
function. 
Hepatic impairment 
After administration of a single 40 mg dose of relugolix to patients with mild or moderate hepatic 
impairment, no clinically meaningful effects on the rate or extent of absorption of relugolix were 
observed, although small numerical differences in the exposure-related pharmacokinetic parameters 
were noted. In patients with mild hepatic impairment total exposure to relugolix was decreased by 
31% and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment exposure was decreased by 5%, compared 
with healthy participants with normal hepatic function. These slight decreases are probably more a 
reflection of the large between-subject variability and the small group size (as noted before) than a 
true effect. The terminal elimination t1/2 estimates were nearly the same (52, 51, and 49 hours) in

patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment and healthy participants with normal hepatic 
function, respectively.  
Extrinsic Factors / Drug Interactions 
The clinical pharmacology program for Orgovyx consisted of seven drug interaction studies, five of 
which assessed the impact of other drugs on relugolix (victim interactions: TAK-385/CPH-010, C27005, 
MVT-601-043, MVT-601-1004, MVT-601-054) and two that assessed the effect of relugolix on other 
drugs (perpetrator interactions: MVT-601-044, and MVT-601-045). 
In vitro: Effect of Other Drugs on Relugolix (Victim Interactions) 
Relugolix is a substrate for the P-gp efflux transporter responsible for the limited oral bioavailability 
(11.6%) and the absorption-related drug interactions due to P-gp inhibition or induction. Although a 
minor pathway in vivo, in vitro data showed that CYP3A4 is responsible for 45% of CYP-mediated 
metabolism, and therefore the potential effects of P-gp and/or CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers on the 
pharmacokinetics of relugolix were clinically studied (Victim Interactions). 
In vitro: Effect of Relugolix on Other Drugs (Perpetrator Interactions) 
In pooled human liver microsomes, relugolix was not a direct inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6, nor was there a time-dependent inhibition of any CYP enzyme, 
including CYP3A4/5. However, based on in vitro studies, relugolix has the potential for CYP3A4/5-
mediated drug interactions due to induction (relugolix induced CYP3A4 mRNA expression in human 
hepatocytes in a concentration-dependent manner at concentrations ≥ 1 µM) or direct inhibition 
(relugolix inhibited midazolam 1’-hydroxylase activity with an IC50 value of 16 µM). 
Based on the exposure associated with the proposed clinical dose of 120 mg once daily, results from 
the in vitro studies indicate that relugolix has the potential to interact with intestinal CYP3A, and 
therefore a drug interaction study with midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate, was conducted (MVT-
601-044). 
For CYP2B6, the lowest concentration of relugolix that resulted in a positive in vitro CYP2B6 mRNA 
induction signal was observed at ≥ 3 μM relugolix, which is at least 73-fold higher than the unbound 
Cmax for relugolix based on oral doses of 120 mg QD (Cmax,u,ss 41 nM). Taken together with the weak 
clinical induction of CYP3A by relugolix at 120 mg QD, the potential for clinically meaningful induction 
of CYP2B6 is unlikely. 
In vitro studies demonstrated that relugolix was not an inhibitor of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, 
OCT2, or BSEP at the concentrations tested, but relugolix inhibited transport by P-gp, BCRP, MATE1, 
and MATE2-K. Based on in vitro inhibitory potencies and estimated relugolix exposures associated with 
administration of 120-mg doses of relugolix once daily, there is potential for relugolix to inhibit 
intestinal BCRP based on thresholds defined in the agency guidelines for drug interactions (for a 120-
mg dose, the Igut/IC50 value was 30.9, marginally exceeding the recommended threshold of 10, 
indicating potential for a clinically meaningful drug interaction with intestinal BCRP. Therefore, for 
BCRP a clinical drug-drug interaction study with rosuvastatin, a substrate for the BCRP efflux 
transporter, was conducted (MVT-601-045). 
The projected Igut concentration based on a 120 mg dose of relugolix (770  µM) results in an Igut/IC50 
value of 12.6 for P-gp, suggesting that a clinically-relevant interaction with P-gp substrates may be 
possible. Since the more than dose proportional increase in relugolix exposure suggests saturation of 
P-gp with increasing doses, a clinical DDI study with a P-gp substrate such as dabigatran etexilate or 
fexofenadine is required for the 120 mg dose of relugolix. Such DDI study is already a post-approval 
commitment for the Ryeqo application for the 40 mg relugolix dose and will also include an arm with 
the 120 mg dose of relugolix.

In vivo: Effect of Other Drugs on Relugolix (Victim Interactions) 
The potential effects of P-gp and/or CYP3A inhibitors or inducers on the pharmacokinetics of relugolix 
were assessed in four dedicated clinical pharmacology studies. The selection of specific inhibitors and 
inducers facilitated a better understanding of the relative contribution from P-gp and CYP3A mediated 
effects. 
A summary of the results from the clinical DDI studies on the effects of coadministered drugs on 
relugolix PK is presented in Table 6.

If co-administration is necessary, take 
relugolix first and separate dosing by at 
least 6 hours for P-gp inhibitors with a 
once or twice daily dosing regimen. 
Alternatively, treatment with relugolix 
may be interrupted for up to two weeks 
if a short course of treatment with a P-
gp inhibitor with dosing regimen of 
more than twice daily is required. 
See above.

In vivo: Effect of Relugolix on Other Drugs (Perpetrator Interactions) 
Based on in vitro data, dedicated clinical pharmacology studies to assess the potential effect of 
relugolix on midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate (MVT-601-044) and rosuvastatin, a BCRP 
substrate (MVT-601-045) were considered necessary. In the two studies, the potential effects of both a

40- and 120-mg dose of relugolix were evaluated in Part 1 and Part 2 of each study, respectively, 
considering that potential inhibition and/or inductive effects are dose (concentration)-dependent. 
Results from the midazolam interaction study (MVT-601-044), in which a single 5-mg dose of 
midazolam was co-administered with a 40-mg (Part 1) or a 120-mg (Part 2) dose of relugolix following 
once daily administration of respective doses of relugolix for 14 days, showed that the potential 
inductive and/or inhibitory effects of relugolix on CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of midazolam, a 
sensitive CYP3A4 substrate, are slight and do not appear to be dose dependent (Figure 4).  
Results from the rosuvastatin interaction study (MVT-601-045), in which a single 10-mg dose of 
rosuvastatin was co-administered with a 40-mg (Part 1) or a 120-mg (Part 2) dose of relugolix 
following once daily administration of respective doses of relugolix for 14 days, showed a small 
decrease in exposure to rosuvastatin, a BCRP efflux transporter, that appeared to have a dose-related 
effect (Figure 4). 
Overall, upon co-administration with relugolix, the total exposure (AUC0-∞) to rosuvastatin decreased 
with a trend toward a dose-related effect (13% reduction for 40 mg dose and 27% reduction for 120-
mg dose of relugolix).

Effect of Mixed-Mechanism Perpetrator Enzalutamide 
Enzalutamide is a potent androgen receptor signalling inhibitor that blocks several steps in the 
androgen receptor signalling pathway, also used for treatment of prostate cancer. The SmPC of Xtandi 
(enzalutamide) mentions that enzalutamide is a strong CYP3A inducer and may also be an inducer of 
Assessment report  
EMA/218094/2022  
Page 53/176 
 
 
 
 
 
 
P-gp, Also, there is some indication that enzalutamide may be an inhibitor of P-gp as well. This is 
comparable to the effects of rifampin. 
For all study participants included in study MVT-601-3201, treatment with relugolix was initiated as 
monotherapy. In 20 patients, whose disease progressed during the study, enzalutamide was 
prescribed in accordance with prostate cancer treatment guidelines, in combination with relugolix for a 
mean of 113 days. During treatment with relugolix alone, combination therapy with enzalutamide < 30 
days and combination therapy with enzalutamide > 30 days, mean relugolix trough concentrations in 
plasma were 9.6, 11.9 and 10.2 ng/mL, respectively. Corresponding values for testosterone predose 
concentrations in serum were 10.1, 12.5 and 15.7 ng/dL, respectively, demonstrating sustained 
therapeutic suppression of testosterone concentrations during combination therapy with relugolix and 
enzalutamide.  
Drug-drug Interaction Potential for Drugs Effecting Gastric pH 
Based on the solubility profile of relugolix, a 360-mg dose (recommended loading dose) and a 120-mg 
dose (recommended daily dose) of relugolix will completely dissolve in vivo at or below pH 5.2 and pH 
5.6, respectively. Thus, relugolix is highly soluble at typical gastric (stomach) pH and absorption of 
relugolix is unlikely to be limited by solubility or dissolution under the conditions typically observed in 
the upper gastrointestinal tract. Thus, relugolix dissolution may be pH sensitive. 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
The pharmacodynamic effects of relugolix were evaluated after single and multiple dose 
administrations in healthy male subjects (study C27001). A thorough QT/QTc Study has been 
performed, which has been previously reflected in the initial MA for Ryeqo (see Ryeqo EPAR). An

Mechanism of action 
Relugolix (previously known as TAK-385 and T-1331285) is an orally active, nonpeptide gonadotropin-
releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist that competitively binds to GnRH receptors in the 
anterior pituitary gland, which blocks endogenous GnRH signaling and prevents the release of 
luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary gland with 
a resultant decrease in the production of the sex steroid hormones, including testosterone from the 
testes. After oral administration of relugolix, a rapid and reversible, dose-dependent decrease in LH 
and FSH concentrations is observed, with corresponding decreases in systemic testosterone 
concentrations. 
Primary pharmacology 
The single- and multiple-rising dose study (C27001) was a double-blind, randomized, placebo 
controlled, 4-part study to assess the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and testosterone 
lowering efficacy of relugolix in healthy adult men. This study was conducted in the United Kingdom. 
Overall, a total of 176 male participants of which 171 participants completed the study across all study 
parts.  
Dosing comprised of single 80-, 120-, 180-, or 360-mg dose of relugolix and multiple 20-, 40-, 80-, or 
180 mg doses of relugolix once daily for 14 days or 40-, 60-, 80- or 160-mg doses of relugolix once 
daily for 28 days.

In Part 1 (single dose), blood samples for determination of testosterone, LH, FSH, and 
dihydrotestosterone (DHT) serum concentrations were collected pre-dose and at prespecified 
timepoints up to 48 hours post-dose. 
In Part 2 (14 days dosing), blood samples for determination of testosterone, LH, FSH, and DHT serum 
concentrations were collected pre-dose and at prespecified timepoints up to 24 hours post-dose (Day 
1) and pre-dose and at prespecified timepoints up to 48 hours post-dose (urine collected up to 24 
hours post-dose) (Day 14). Blood samples for determination of testosterone, LH, FSH, and DHT serum 
concentrations were collected pre-dose on certain days between Day 3 and Day 13. 
In Part 3 and Part 4 (28 days dosing), Day 1 and Day 28, blood samples for the determination of 
testosterone and LH serum concentrations were collected pre-dose and at prespecified timepoints up to 
24 hours post-dose; additional samples were collected 672 hours after the last dose on Day 28 and 
pre-dose on Days 7, 14, and 21. Blood samples for determination of FSH, DHT, and insulin-like growth 
factor 1 serum concentrations were collected pre-dose on Days 1, 14, and 28. 
Serum testosterone was assayed using a conventional immunoassay for screening (LLOQ = 0.4 
nmol/L). A validated LC/MS/MS method, with an LLOQ of 0.173 nmol/L and a ULOQ of 10.425 nmol/L, 
was used for all subsequent baseline and post-dose measurements. 
Safety parameters 
Safety was assessed throughout the study by repeated clinical and laboratory evaluations including 
physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, vital sign measurements, ECGs (12-lead) and 
monitoring of adverse events.

Testosterone  
For participants receiving 80-, 120-, 180-, and 360-mg single doses of relugolix, mean serum 
testosterone concentrations decreased 4 to 6 hours post-dose to a nadir at 36 hours, then increased at 
48 hours ( 
Figure 5). Relugolix 360 mg was associated with the most rapid and pronounced decrease in 
testosterone compared with the lower doses.

Dose Administration of TAK-385, Part 1 
Luteinizing hormone (LH) 
After single dose, mean serum LH concentrations were lower in the 360-mg dose cohort than in the 
other 3 dose cohorts at the corresponding timepoints; however, baseline was also lower for the 
360 mg dose group.  
Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) 
Mean serum FSH and DHT concentration profiles were similar across their respective dose cohorts at 
corresponding time points for the 80-, 120-, 180-, and 360-mg groups. Mean serum FSH 
concentrations began to decrease 2 hours post-dose to a low at 48 hours. 
Mean serum DHT concentrations began to decrease 2 hours post-dose. Decreases in DHT were more 
profound in the 180 and 360-mg dose cohorts, with minor and variable further reductions occurring 
after the 12-hour time point.

In Part 2, 1 to 3-day loading dose regimens of relugolix and relugolix 180 mg once daily (without a 
loading dose) resulted in rapid reductions in serum testosterone concentrations over the first 24 hours

were achieved with repeat dosing for 14 days at daily maintenance doses of 40, 80, and 180 mg. The 
20 mg once daily was insufficient in maintaining adequate suppression of testosterone concentrations 
during the second week.

In dosing for 28 days, both 160-mg (Part 3) and 80-mg (Part 4) doses of relugolix were effective at 
achieving castrate levels (< 1.73 nmol/L [< 50 ng/dL]) and profound castrate levels (< 0.69 nmol/L [< 
20 ng/dL]) during the third and fourth weeks of repeat administration, whereas, there was more 
variability in response with 60 mg once daily. The 40-mg once daily dose of relugolix was ineffective in 
maintaining castrate levels between Days 14 and 28, despite use of a loading dose (see  
Figure 7 Part 3 and Figure 8 Part 3 + Part 4).

Exploratory PK-PD correlation 
Sustained, lower-threshold medical castration of < 0.69 nmol/L was consistently achieved at doses of 
80, 160, and 180 mg TAK-385. Consistent with the observed dose-dependent suppression of 
testosterone across the 20 to 180-mg QD studied dose range, the magnitude of the testosterone 
lowering-response was correlated with individual TAK-385 plasma trough concentrations; the higher 
the TAK-385 systemic exposure, the greater the number of subjects achieving and maintaining medical 
castration throughout the treatment period. Median TAK-385 trough concentrations of > 4 ng/mL, 
which were associated with maintenance doses of 80 mg or greater, reduced testosterone to below 
conventional castration levels of 1.73 nmol/L in all subjects, with the majority having serum 
testosterone levels decreased to below the lower castration threshold of 0.69 nmol/L after 28 days of 
treatment with TAK-385.

Safety summary 
Single 80-, 120-, 180-, or 360-mg dose of relugolix and multiple 20-, 40-, 80-, or 180 mg doses of 
relugolix once daily for 14 days or 40-, 60-, 80- or 160-mg doses of relugolix once daily for 28 days 
were generally safe and well tolerated in healthy adult men. Most commonly reported drug-related AEs 
included bradycardia, headache, and hot flush. 
−  Reversible transaminase elevations (ALT and AST) that reached ≥ 3 × ULN, considered to be an 
adverse event of clinical interest, that led to study discontinuation, were observed in two 
participants. Additionally, one participant was also discontinued from the study due to reversible 
transaminase elevations (ALT and AST) that did not meet the criteria for an adverse event of 
clinical interest (ie, maximum values were < 3 × ULN). For all three participants, total bilirubin 
remained within the normal range throughout the study.  
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
A sequential approach was used to develop a semi-mechanistic population PK/PD model. The model 
was based on a previous study by Romero et al., but modified to allow for the quantification of the 
antagonistic properties of relugolix and the absence of data for GnRH and the receptor. Endogenous 
GnRH and the receptor were modelled by conditioning on the changes in testosterone over time. A 
more simple empirical direct or indirect response model could probably be also applied to quantify the 
pharmacodynamics over testosterone. However, the semi-mechanistic model is adequate in describing 
the testosterone concentrations over time and is most likely a more accurate reflection of the systems 
biology. 
The relationship between testosterone concentrations and relugolix Ctrough supports that the 120-mg 
dose of relugolix is the minimum maximally-effective dose (Figure 9). In the pivotal phase 3 study in 
men with advanced prostate cancer (MVT-601-3201) a mean relugolix Ctrough of 9.68 ng/mL was 
observed (Table 5), and based on the relationship between testosterone concentration and relugolix 
Ctrough, this value is strongly associated with testosterone concentrations at castrate levels 
(< 1.73 nmol/L [< 50 ng/dL]) and profound castrate levels (< 0.69 nmol/L [< 20 ng/dL]) (Figure 9). 
This figure also illustrates that the cut-off of 4 ng/mL as a target relugolix trough concentration, 
suggested previously during relugolix development program, appears to be appropriate to achieve 
castrate levels (< 50 ng/dL) in the majority of patients.

Comparability Bounds 
Comparability bounds are devised during clinical development of a new chemical entity based on the 
evolving safety and efficacy profile that defines the therapeutic window, with the upper and lower 
thresholds representing clinically meaningful changes in drug exposures with respect to safety and 
efficacy, respectively. The lower comparability bound represents the degree to which drug exposures 
may decrease without compromising efficacy and is typically based on the exposure-response profile 
specific to a particular compound. The upper comparability bound represents the degree to which drug 
exposures may increase without increasing the risk for experiencing safety-related events and is 
typically based on the clinical safety profile associated with doses or exposures above the 
recommended clinical dose.  
Clinically meaningful changes in drug exposure due to intrinsic or extrinsic factors observed in 
dedicated studies or PopPK analyses can be interpreted in context of the established comparability 
bounds. Specifically, clinically meaningful changes in drug exposure are to be interpreted based on the 
90% CI for the GMR (test/reference) for exposure-related PK parameters (AUC, Cmax, Ctrough) relative to 
the defined lower and upper comparability bounds. 
A lower comparability bound for relugolix of 0.5000 is proposed, based on the PopPK/PD analysis. In 
order to define a lower comparability bound as acceptance criterion for interpretation of clinically 
meaningful decreases in relugolix exposure, the PopPK/PD model was used to perform simulations in 
which the total clearance of relugolix was doubled (2-fold increase in clearance relative to the

estimated clearance from the model). The model-based simulations suggest that with a 2-fold 
clearance, which results in a 50% reduction in relugolix plasma concentrations, more than 90% of the 
patients maintain testosterone concentrations at castrate levels (< 1.73 nmol/L [< 50 ng/dL]), with a 
lower proportion of patients with median testosterone concentrations at profound castrate levels 
(< 0.69 nmol/L [< 20 ng/mL]) ( 
Figure 10).

after which testosterone concentrations remain suppressed.

The thorough QT/QTc Study (TAK-385_106) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and positive-
controlled (open-label moxifloxacin), parallel-group study to assess the potential effects of a 
therapeutic (60 mg) dose and a supratherapeutic (360-mg) dose of relugolix on QT interval 
prolongation in healthy adult men and women. A total of 280 male and female participants, 18 to 55 
years of age, inclusive, were enrolled and 280 participants completed the study, which was conducted 
in the United States.  
Participants received placebo on Day 1 and were randomized (1:1:1:1 ratio) to receive 1 of 4 
treatments: a single 60-mg dose of relugolix, a single 360-mg dose of relugolix, placebo, or a single 
400-mg dose of moxifloxacin on Day 2. Relugolix and placebo were administered double-blind and 
moxifloxacin was administered open-label (after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours and continuing 
to fast for 4 hours post-dose). Blood samples for the determination of relugolix and moxifloxacin 
plasma concentrations were collected pre-dose and at prespecified time points up to 23.5 hours post-
dose. Continuous Holter ECGs (12-lead) for QT interval analysis was performed and data extracted (in 
triplicate) at baseline on Day 1, pre-dose and at prespecified time points up to 23.5 hours post-dose on 
Day 2. Safety was assessed throughout the study by repeated clinical and laboratory evaluations 
including physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, vital sign measurements, ECGs (12-lead) and 
monitoring of adverse events.  
In this study, a 60-mg dose of relugolix was used as a single dose to accommodate accumulation in 
plasma drug concentrations after administration of a 40-mg dose once daily, the therapeutic dose and 
regimen anticipated as the clinical dose for women’s health indications. The 360-mg dose of relugolix 
was selected as the supratherapeutic dose, nine times the anticipated clinical dose for women’s health 
indications.  
Pharmacodynamics 
Administration of single 60- or 360-mg doses of relugolix did not prolong the QT interval/corrected QT 
interval (QT/QTc) interval (based on the QT interval with Bazett, Fridericia, or individual correction 
methods, in accordance with the ICH E14 guidance). This finding was evidenced by an upper bound of 
the 95% CI for the largest time-matched mean difference in QTc between relugolix and placebo 
(baseline-adjusted) being < 10 msec.

Safety Summary  
In this study, a single 60-mg or 360-mg dose of relugolix was generally safe and well tolerated. All 
reported adverse events were mild or moderate in severity and transient in nature. 
All point estimates for the ddQTcF interval were below 5 msec and the upper bound of the 90% CI was 
below 10 msec at each post-dose time point. Adequate assay sensitivity was demonstrated by the 
mixed-effects model for the double delta QT interval with Fridericia correction method (ddQTcF) 
interval for the moxifloxacin treatment, as the lower bounds of the 90% CI of the mean ddQTcF 
interval exceeded 5 msec at all post-dose time points. 
 The mean Cmax after administration of single 360-mg dose of relugolix (252.94 ng/mL) was 13.8 times 
greater than the mean Cmax associated with a 40-mg dose at steady state (18.31 ng/mL; MVT-601-
039). 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Overall, the pharmacokinetics of the 120 mg dose of relugolix in men with prostate cancer can be 
considered sufficiently characterised. After oral administration of a single 360 mg loading dose, the 
mean (± standard deviation [± SD]) of AUC0-24 and Cmax of relugolix were 985 (± 742) ng.hr/mL 
and 215 (± 184) ng/mL, respectively. After administration of a 120 mg dose once daily, the mean (± 
SD), Cmax, Cavg (average plasma concentration over the 24-hour dosing interval), and Ctrough of 
relugolix at steady-state were 70 (± 65) ng/mL, 17.0 (± 7) ng/mL and 10.7 (± 4) ng/mL, respectively. 
The accumulation of exposure to relugolix upon once daily administration of a 120 mg dose of relugolix 
Assessment report  
EMA/218094/2022  
Page 65/176 
 
 
 
 
 
is approximately 2 fold. After once daily administration of relugolix following a 360 mg loading dose on 
the first day of administration, steady state of relugolix is achieved by day 7. 
The pharmacokinetic performance of the three tablet formulations, in terms of the total exposure 
(AUC), Cmax, and time to Cmax (tmax), was relatively comparable as the point estimates for Cmax and AUC 
were within range of 0.80-1.25 for the comparison of the T4B (single 120 mg) and T2 (80 mg + 40 
mg) tablets. The T3 tablet is expected to be comparable, because the formulation is not different from 
the T2 tablets aside from the film-coating. It can be concluded that the results from the clinical studies 
with the T2 and T3 tablet formulations can be generalized to the final market formulation and results 
from the various PK studies across this application can be used interchangeably. 
For the interpretation of clinically meaningful changes in drug exposure due to intrinsic/extrinsic 
factors, comparability bounds in total exposure (AUC) of 0.5000– 1.5000 are proposed. In this context 
it is acceptable that Orgovyx can be administered without regards to food. It would have been 
preferred if the pivotal phase 3 study in men with advanced prostate cancer (MVT-601-3201) had been 
conducted under the same conditions as the proposed labelling posology (no food restrictions). 
However, this issue is not pursued, since the food effect with a decrease in exposure of relugolix is not 
clinically meaningful. 
Given the effects of the drug-drug interaction study with voriconazole, with a 50% increase in relugolix 
exposure at the 40 mg relugolix dose, CYP3A4 is estimated to contribute 34% of the elimination of 
relugolix. The contribution of CYP3A4 to the metabolism of a relugolix dose of 120 mg is likely smaller, 
since an increase of 10% was observed after inhibition of CYP3A4 for this dose. Based on in vitro data, 
CYP2C8 is likely to be involved, but to lesser extent than CYP3A4. 
Based on the many minor peaks observed in the radio-chromatograms, multiple other enzymes are 
likely to be involved, although not identified. Based on hydrophilic metabolites excreted in bile in rats, 
and hydrophilic metabolite observed in excreta in humans, UGT involvement cannot be excluded and 
this might be in line with the reasonably high first-pass metabolism and potential elimination via bile. 
In the end, the data were considered sufficient to characterize the primary/major routes of relugolix 
metabolism (i.e. CYP3A and intestinal microflora) and the potential impact with respect to clinically 
meaningful drug-drug interactions. 
The expression of BCRP in the Caco-2 cells in the Applicant’s study is not entirely clear and it cannot be 
concluded with certainty that relugolix is not a substrate for BCRP. Nevertheless, it is clear from the in 
vitro and in vivo studies that the absorption of relugolix is mainly affected by P-gp. 
It seems unlikely that OCT1 plays a major role in the uptake of relugolix in the liver, based on the 
moderate passive permeability of relugolix, the high molecular weight, and wide tissue distribution 
observed in pre-clinical species including high tissue distribution in pituitary, which does not rely on 
OCT1. Although it cannot be excluded that relugolix might be a substrate for OCT1, the clinical 
relevance seems limited. 
The greater than dose-proportional increase in exposure to relugolix is primarily attributable to dose-
related saturation of intestinal P-gp (which is considered to govern oral bioavailability of relugolix), 
rather than systemic metabolism and/or elimination. 
After administration of 80-mg doses of relugolix once daily for 14 days, the mean t1/2, eff was 25 hours, 
indicating that the systemic exposure (in terms of AUC) to relugolix reduced by half in approximately 
24 hours and thereby supporting once daily administration. 
The available data do not allow an easy comparison of the PK exposure parameters between healthy 
men and men with prostate cancer, as the groups are very small (n=3) and the inherent variability is 
large. 
Assessment report

The central volume of distribution in the population PK model showed a trend of lower values in 
healthy adult men versus adult men with prostate cancer, but this trend was not statistically significant 
nor clinically meaningful, also taking into account the large value for apparent volume of distribution at 
steady state of approximately 3900 L. 
Exposure to relugolix slightly increases with age in men with prostate cancer, however this is not 
clinically relevant and requires no dose adjustment. 
A demographic summary of the Black/African American men versus the non-Black/African American 
men in study MVT-601-3201 showed that the distribution of body weight was similar between the 
Black/African American men and the non-Black/African American men in study MVT-601-3201, 
whereas the age of the Black/African American men was on average 6.5 years younger than the age of 
the non-Black/African American men in study MVT-601-3201. However, age is known to be inversely 
related to CL/F of relugolix, which would have been associated with a lower rather than a higher 
exposure to relugolix in the Black/African American men. Therefore, the higher exposure to relugolix in 
the Black/African American is apparently not attributable to either the body weight or age distribution. 
Thus, no apparent explanation is found for the difference in exposure to relugolix between 
Black/African American men and non-Black/African American men. As no apparent major differences 
were observed in safety profile between both-sub-populations, it is agreed that the relatively modest 
increase in exposure to relugolix in the Black/African American men is not clinically meaningful. 
As the terminal t1/2 is not affected in the subjects with renal impairment and because only 19% of the 
absorbed relugolix is excreted via the renal pathway, this increase in exposure may be related to an 
increase in oral absorption rather than a decrease in renal elimination. However, this is not completely 
clear. 
However, in the phase 3 study not enough patients with severe renal impairment were included to 
draw firm conclusions on the effect of severe renal impairment (and besides the PopPK model 
apparently did not allow for simulations of Cmax,ss). Therefore, based on the dedicated renal impairment 
studies with 40 mg relugolix, the conclusion remains that exposure to relugolix (AUC0-t) increased 2.0-
fold in subjects with severe renal function impairment and this conservative estimate should be 
extrapolated also to the 120 mg dose. Since the effect of severe renal impairment on the 
pharmacokinetics of relugolix does not fall within the comparability bounds of 0.5000 to 1.5000, this 
effect is reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC where it states that as a lower dose of relugolix is not 
available, caution in patients with severe renal impairment is warranted upon administration of a 120 
mg dose of relugolix once daily, and the amount of relugolix removed by haemodialysis is unknown. 
Based on the from the hepatic impairment study with 40 mg of relugolix, no dose adjustment in mild 
or moderate hepatic impairment for relugolix would be required. Since hepatic impairment does not 
seem to play a major role in the total exposure to relugolix and it is not very likely that hepatic 
impairment may affect amount and saturation of (intestinal) P-gp, these conclusions may be 
extrapolated to the 120 mg dose. The effects of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of 
relugolix have not been evaluated. This has been reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
In general, the designs of the clinical DDI studies were considered acceptable. Some of the DDI studies 
were done with a 40 mg dose of relugolix, where it may be noted that results from study MVT-601-054 
indicate that this 40 mg dose is the dose for which the most pronounced interaction is expected (as 
compared to the 120 mg dose).  
Effects of erythromycin on the pharmacokinetics of relugolix could be multifactorial such as inhibition 
of intestinal and hepatic transporters and enzymes but also affecting the intestinal flora and thereby 
reducing the formation of metabolite C. It was shown that the formation of metabolite C could be 
inhibited by erythromycin but the effect of erythromycin on relugolix exposure was very fast, while 
Assessment report

formation of metabolite C is likely to occur later, further down the intestinal tract. Thus, the effect of 
erythromycin is probably related to a first-pass effect on the oral bioavailability of relugolix, as 
concluded in the Ryeqo assessment. The results indicate that the increase in exposure associated with 
co-administration of erythromycin was primarily a P-gp-mediated effect and likely to result from an 
increase in oral bioavailability due to inhibition of intestinal P-gp efflux. Based on these results the 
following text is reflected in section 4.5 of the SmPC: 
P-gp inhibitors 
Avoid co-administration of Orgovyx and oral P-gp inhibitors. If co-administration with once or twice 
daily oral P-gp inhibitors cannot be avoided, take Orgovyx first, separate dosing by at least 6 hours, 
and monitor patients more frequently for adverse reactions. 
It is agreed that co-administration with oral P-gp inhibitors should be avoided. The dose separation 
strategy with P-gp inhibitors is already agreed upon for the Ryeqo application with the 40 mg relugolix 
dose. A clinical study (MVT-601-055) investigating this dose separation strategy both for the 40 mg 
and 120 mg relugolix dose is planned.  
It is agreed that the effects of mild, moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors will remain below the upper 
limit of the proposed acceptability (comparability) bounds of 0.500-1.5000 for concluding no clinically 
relevant effect. 
Furthermore, the following is proposed in Section 4.5 of the SmPC about strong P-gp/CYP3A inducers: 
Combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inducers 
Avoid co-administration of Orgovyx with combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inducers. Upon co-
administration with rifampicin, a P-gp and strong CYP3A inducer, the AUC and Cmax of relugolix were 
decreased by 55% and 23%, respectively, due to induction of intestinal P-gp (and CYP3A) by 
rifampicin, which resulted in a decrease in the oral bioavailability of relugolix. Co-administration of 
Orgovyx with other combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inducers also may decrease the AUC and Cmax of 
relugolix and may therefore reduce the therapeutic effects of Orgovyx. If co-administration cannot be 
avoided, increase the Orgovyx dose (see section 4.2). After discontinuation of the combined P-gp and 
strong CYP3A inducer, resume the recommended dose of Orgovyx once daily.  
The recommendation that the Orgovyx dose should be doubled to 240 mg daily when co-administered 
with combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inducers is based on the results of study MVT-601-1004 which 
demonstrated a 2.2-fold decrease in exposure when 40 mg relugolix is co-administered with rifampin.  
Based on results from the midazolam interaction study, relugolix is considered to be a weak inducer of 
CYP3A4. Because the relatively small decreases in exposure to midazolam observed upon co-
administration with relugolix, a clinically meaningful decrease in exposure for other CYP3A4 substrates 
is unlikely. 
The decreases in exposure to rosuvastatin upon co-administration with relugolix were unexpected 
considering that inhibition of the BCRP efflux transporter would be expected to result in an increase, 
rather than a decrease, in exposure. One might speculate that relugolix induces expression of either 
BCRP or OATP1B1, for which rosuvastatin is a substrate. Although the effect is not well understood, the 
decreases in rosuvastatin exposure for both doses (40 and 120 mg relugolix) are considered small and 
not clinically relevant. Relugolix does not appear to be an inhibitor of BCRP in vivo.  
Rosuvastatin is also a substrate of OATP2B1, which has not been tested yet in vitro. It is known that 
inhibition of the intestinal OATP2B1 transporter can result in a decrease of rosuvastatin exposure. 
Therefore, the Applicant will investigate if relugolix is an inhibitor of intestinal OATP2B1 and submit the 
results of this study as a Post-Approval Measure.

Overall, from study MVT-601-3201, it can be concluded that limited data (n=20) from a Phase III trial 
indicate that when enzalutamide (strong CYP3A inducer and androgen receptor signalling inhibitor) is 
added to relugolix treatment, relugolix trough concentrations were not decreased and the same 
relugolix dose may be maintained. The testosterone trough concentrations were not further decreased 
upon co-administration with enzalutamide. 
Although no dedicated studies were conducted, relugolix may be administered with acid-reducing 
agents, because no clinically meaningful interaction was observed based on castrate levels in patients 
receiving these drugs concomitantly in the Phase 3 study. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Relugolix is an orally active, non-peptide GnRH receptor antagonist that competitively binds to GnRH 
receptors on gonadotrophic neurons, blocking endogenous GnRH from binding to and subsequent 
activation of GnRH receptors, preventing the release of LH and FSH from the anterior pituitary gland. 
As a result, circulating concentrations of LH and FSH are considerably reduced, resulting in decreased 
testosterone production by Leydig cells of the testes and a subsequent decrease in systemic 
testosterone concentrations. 
The single- and multiple-rising dose study 
The single- and multiple-rising dose study (C27001) in 176 healthy adult men in the UK with high 
doses (up to 180 and 360-mg dose of relugolix), showed that relugolix caused an immediate and 
effective suppression of gonadotropins (LH, FSH) and testosterone over 14 days. This study was 
performed to support the possible indication for advanced prostate cancer.  
Pharmacodynamic assessments of relugolix single and multiple dose over 14-28 days demonstrated 
sustained testosterone suppression from 80 mg once daily, which is accompanied by strong 
suppression of LH. The 60 mg had variable results, while the 20 mg and 40 mg appeared ineffective in 
maintenance over longer time, despite the use of a 320-360 mg loading dose. These results sufficiently 
support the 80 mg dose for further assessment in phase 2, and employment of a loading dose in case 
a more rapid reduction in testosterone is needed. 
Regarding safety, relugolix was well tolerated. However, in two patients reversible transaminase 
elevations (ALT and AST) of ≥ 3 × ULN were reported, which led to discontinuation.  
MVT-601-3201 
In the pivotal phase 3 study in men with advanced prostate cancer (MVT-601-3201), relugolix 120 mg 
once daily, following a single oral loading dose of relugolix 360 mg on Day 1, was associated with rapid 
reductions in LH, FSH. 
Dedicated thorough QTc study 
In a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and positive-controlled (open-label moxifloxacin), parallel-
group, single-dose thorough QT/QTc study (TAK-385_106), neither a 60-mg dose (therapeutic dose; 
estimated to have similar exposure as a single dose to those associated with a once daily 40-mg dose) 
nor a 360-mg dose (supratherapeutic dose) of relugolix resulted in prolongation of the QT interval with 
Fridericia’s correction (QTcF) of clinical or regulatory concern. There appears some hysteresis as the 
largest effect was observed after 10 hours instead of around tmax (3 hours), however, with no 
suggestion for QT prolongation this is not considered of such relevance to be further pursued. 
Administration of single 60- or 360-mg doses of relugolix did not prolong the QTcF interval in healthy 
adult men and women to a level of regulatory concern. Single 60- or 360-mg doses of relugolix were 
generally safe and well tolerated in healthy adult men and women.

Pharmacodynamic interactions 
For typical co-medication in this indication, it is noted that abiraterone is an androgen biosynthesis 
inhibitor that (by itself) will thus decrease testosterone concentrations. The androgen receptor 
(signalling) inhibitors enzalutamide and apalutamide are not expected to have any relevant effect on 
testosterone concentrations (by themselves), but they do exert an anti-androgenic effect. For the 
taxane docetaxel, any potential for PD interaction is not expected, based on its antineoplastic/cytotoxic 
mechanism of action. 
The Applicant is currently performing an on-going phase 1 safety and tolerability study (MVT-601-049; 
NCT04666129) investigating the combination of relugolix with either abiraterone/prednisone, 
apalutamide, or docetaxel with respect to PK and PD. The clinical study report will be submitted as a 
Post-Approval Measure (REC). For conclusions regarding enzalutamide (strong CYP3A inhibitor and 
androgen receptor signalling inhibitor), see relevant section. 
Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics 
The relationship between testosterone concentrations and relugolix Ctrough supports that the mean 
relugolix Ctrough of 9.68 ng/mL upon once daily 120-mg dosing is strongly associated with testosterone 
concentrations at castrate levels (< 50 ng/dL) and profound castrate levels (< 20 ng/dL). 
For the interpretation of clinically meaningful changes in drug exposure due to intrinsic or extrinsic 
factors observed in dedicated studies or PopPK analyses comparability bounds in total exposure (AUC) 
of 0.5000 – 1.5000 are proposed. The lower limit of 0.50 mirrors a 50% reduction in relugolix plasma 
concentrations, while more than 90% of the patients maintain testosterone concentrations at castrate 
levels (< 50 ng/dL). 
The upper limit is based on the safety profiles of relugolix after administration of single doses up to 
360 mg in healthy men and women in the single and multiple rising-dose study (C27001) and the 
thorough QT/QTc study (TAK-385-106), and after administration of multiple doses of 160-mg once 
daily for 28 days and 180-mg doses once daily for 14 days in healthy men (C27001). 
There are on-going studies for which the Applicant is recommended to submit the study reports as 
Post-Approval Measure: 
1.  Final clinical study report of study MVT-601-049 in 4Q of 2023, which is an ongoing phase 1 safety 
and tolerability for the combination of relugolix with either abiraterone, apalutamide, or docetaxel 
with respect to PK and PD; 
2.  Final bioanalytical report for all testosterone concentration data measured at Covance Shanghai for 
study MVT-601-3201 as soon as the report becomes available. The expected timing of the final 
bioanalytical report is Q2 of 2022;

(azithromycin) has been completed with FPFV occurring on 13 Aug 2021 and LPLV on 04 Oct 2021. 
Top-line results are expected to become available in March 2022. The Applicant is recommended to 
provide the CSR as a PAM as soon the final CSR becomes available. The expected timing of the 
final CSR is Q2 of 2022;

2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the pharmacokinetics of the 120 mg dose of relugolix in men with prostate cancer can be 
considered sufficiently characterised. All relevant information has been reflected in the SmPC. A set of 
recommendations for Post-Approval Measures have been described above. 
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.6.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
The primary efficacy objective of the prostate cancer clinical development program was to evaluate the 
ability of relugolix to suppress and maintain serum testosterone to castrate levels (< 50 ng/dL) in 
patients with advanced prostate cancer. An overview of the clinical efficacy studies of relugolix in the 
treatment of prostate cancer is provided in Table 2 at the beginning of the Clinical section. 
The dose of relugolix used in the main study was selected based on results from these phase 1 and 
phase 2 studies, and quantitative assessment of the exposure-response relationship observed for the 
effect of relugolix on testosterone suppression in patients with prostate cancer (see previous section). 
On the basis of these analyses, a single oral loading dose of 360 mg (a multiple of the maintenance 
daily dose) on Day 1 was selected to achieve plasma concentrations close to steady state within the 
first few days following the first dose. The maintenance dose of 120 mg daily was identified to ensure 
that > 90% of patients would achieve and maintain medical castration through 48 weeks of continuous 
treatment with relugolix, while maintaining an acceptable clinical safety profile. 
2.6.5.2.  Main study(ies) 
HERO: A Multinational Phase 3 Randomized, Open-label, Parallel Group 
Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Relugolix in Men with 
Advanced Prostate Cancer 
The pivotal phase 3 study MVT-601-3201 (HERO; EudraCT Number: 2017-000160-15; 
NCT03085095; Shore et al. N Engl J Med. 2020) aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral 
relugolix vs leuprolide in patients with androgen sensitive advanced prostate cancer who required at 
least 1 year of continuous ADT. 
A total of approximately 1100 patients across three cohorts were to be enrolled including 
approximately 915 patients for the primary analysis (Cohort 1) and 390 patients with metastatic 
advanced prostate cancer (Cohort 2) and 138 Chinese patients (Cohort 3). 
At the time of the primary analysis, the study had been performed at 155 centres globally, including 
North and South America, Europe, and Asia between 18-Apr-2017 (first patient randomized and dosed) 
and 25-Oct-2019 (last patient completed). The database lock date for the primary analysis was 10-
Dec-2019. The final version of the study protocol, i.e. following Amendment 3, was 23-Oct-2018.

mg tablet orally once daily for 48 weeks; 
Assessment report  
EMA/218094/2022  
Page 73/176 
 
 
 
• 
Leuprolide 3-month depot injection, 22.5 mg (or 11.25 mg in Japan, Taiwan, and China) every 
12 weeks for 48 weeks (last injection occurred 12 weeks prior to the end of the treatment 
period). 
Patients randomized to relugolix received the first oral (loading) dose on Day 1 in the clinic. 
Leuprolide was administered on Day 1 at the clinic and thereafter at 12-week intervals, either by 
intramuscular or subcutaneous injection; investigators were instructed to follow product instructions 
provided by the manufacturer. Administration of an antiandrogen (e.g. bicalutamide, flutamide, 
nilutamide) was permitted for the first 4 weeks or longer if indicated, as determined by the 
investigator, for the management of the initial flare response. The dose of leuprolide 3-month depot 
injection was selected as per product instructions provided by the manufacturer for both the 22.5 mg 
and the 11.25 mg dose. 
Dose modifications 
Dose modifications were not permitted during the study. 
Prohibited medications 
The following systemic medications were prohibited prior to the first dose of study medication until the 
End of Treatment visit and the Follow-up Period was complete, e.g.: GnRH analogues; GnRH receptor 
antagonists; antiandrogens; CYP17 inhibitors; other androgen suppressing agents or androgens; 
5alpha reductase inhibitors; Class IA and III antiarrhythmics; moderate and strong CYP3A and P -
glycoprotein inducers; moderate/strong P-glycoprotein inhibitors; high-dose biotin supplements; herbal 
therapies. 
Objectives and outcomes/endpoints 
The objectives and outcomes/endpoints of the study are listed in Table 9. 
For the primary efficacy endpoint, there were two evaluation criteria in the protocol to support different 
regulatory requirements for assessing benefit, see Table 9. Evaluation Criterion 1 was a regulatory 
requirement from the FDA and was the trial success criterion for the primary efficacy endpoint. 
Evaluation Criterion 2, the primary efficacy endpoint required by EMA, was the first to be tested in the 
order of ranked key secondary endpoints to assess non-inferiority of relugolix compared with leuprolide 
after Evaluation Criterion 1 was passed (see Statistical methods). 
The primary hypotheses associated with these two evaluation criteria for the primary endpoint in this 
study were: 
•  Hypothesis 1, corresponding to Evaluation Criterion 1: the cumulative probability of testosterone 
suppression to < 50 ng/dL for relugolix while on study drug from Week 5 Day 1 through Week 49 
Day 1 is ≥ 90%. 
Null hypothesis H01: πR < 0.9 versus Alternative hypothesis Ha1: πR ≥ 0.9 
•  Hypothesis 2, corresponding to Evaluation Criterion 2: relugolix is noninferior to leuprolide 3 month 
depot injection, as assessed by the cumulative probability of sustained testosterone suppression 
with a non-inferiority margin of –10%. 
Null hypothesis H02: πR – πL < –10% versus Alternative hypothesis Ha2: πR – πL ≥ -10% 
where πR and πL are the sustained castration rates for the relugolix and leuprolide groups, 
respectively. 
Assessment report  
EMA/218094/2022

The -10% non-inferiority margin for the comparison of relugolix versus leuprolide was based on 
regulatory precedence of the pivotal assessment of the GnRH receptor antagonist degarelix versus 
leuprolide as well as studies of branded GnRH receptor agonist generics.

a Castration resistance-free survival was not assessed in the primary analysis of the study, but is was assessed at 
the time of the final analysis. 
Sample size 
Sample size determination for this study was based on the assumptions that the probability of 
sustained testosterone suppression was 94% and 96% for relugolix and leuprolide, respectively, a 2:1 
randomization ratio (relugolix: leuprolide); and a dropout rate of 15%. 
• 
• 
For Evaluation Criterion 1, 610 patients in the relugolix group would provide approximately 
90% power to rule out a fixed probability of sustained testosterone suppression of < 90% at a 
two-sided type I error rate of 0.05. 
For Evaluation Criterion 2, with a non-inferiority margin of -10% and an overall two-sided type 
I error rate of 0.05, a total of approximately 915 patients (610 receiving relugolix, 305 
receiving leuprolide) will yield at least 99% power to declare the non-inferiority of relugolix to 
leuprolide. 
In total, approximately 1100 patients across three cohorts were to be enrolled including approximately 
915 patients for the primary analysis (Cohort 1, enrolled under Protocol Amendment 2; see Conduct 
of study) and 390 patients with metastatic advanced prostate cancer (Cohort 2) and 138 Chinese 
patients (Cohort 3, enrolled in China and Taiwan), both enrolled under Protocol Amendment 3. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either the relugolix or the leuprolide treatment group by 
using an interactive web response system (IWRS). Randomization was stratified by geographic region, 
presence of metastatic disease, and age as follows: 
•  Geographic region: Europe vs North and South America vs Asia and rest of world; 
• 
Presence of metastatic disease (by locally read imaging; metastases in regional lymph node(s) are 
considered N1 and, therefore, stratified as non-metastatic): yes vs no; and 
•  Baseline age: ≤ 75 years old vs > 75 years old. 
Blinding was not applicable, as this was an open-label study. Some data access restrictions intended to 
minimize bias were put in place. The blinded team consisted of a statistician in charge of writing the 
statistical analysis plan (SAP) and a programmer. The rest of the study team was unblinded, including 
other personnel involved in SAP development. 
Statistical methods 
The SAP was finalized on 12-Sep 2019 then amended on 29-Oct-2019 and 07-Nov-2019 to incorporate 
FDA advice, and on 13-Jul-2020 to clarify definitions of analysis populations and to clarify that pre-
Assessment report

Page 77/176 
 
 
 
specified descriptive analyses (i.e., the alpha-protected endpoints) would not be updated for the final 
analysis. The procedures described in the SAP supersede those described in the protocol. 
There were two analyses for this study: a primary analysis and a final analysis (and thus no interim 
analysis). The primary analysis of safety and efficacy occurred after 934 patients were randomized to 
the study (Cohort 1) and completed the 48-week treatment period and 30-day safety follow-up visit or 
discontinued early. The final analysis of the study occurred after approximately 390 patients with 
metastatic disease (of whom, 295 patients were also included in the primary analysis [Cohort 1]) had 
been randomized to the study (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2) and had either completed 48 weeks of study 
treatment inclusive of the 30-day safety follow-up visit or discontinued early. Results of the efficacy 
analysis in the China cohort (Cohort 3) were not included in the primary analysis clinical study report 
(CSR) and are therefore not included in this assessment report. 
All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS® Version 9.2 or higher. 
A statistical test for the primary endpoint was assessed at a two-sided α = 0.05 significance level, and 
all confidence intervals (CIs) were reported as two-sided, unless otherwise stated. 
Where appropriate, variables were summarized descriptively by study visit. For categorical variables, 
the count and proportions of each possible value were tabulated by treatment group. For continuous 
variables, the number of patients with non-missing values, mean, median, standard deviation, 
minimum, and maximum values were tabulated. 
Analysis populations 
For the primary analysis, the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population was defined as all 
randomized patients who received at least one dose of any study drug. Unless otherwise specified, all 
analyses used the mITT population by treatment group as assigned by randomization (not by actual 
treatment received). The mITT population is the primary population used for efficacy endpoints. 
For the final analysis, the following populations were used for the efficacy data. 
•  mITT Final Analysis Population: defined as all patients randomized who had taken at least one dose 
of any study drug for the final analysis of the study. Only the CRFS endpoint was analysed in this 
population. 
•  mITT Metastatic Patient Population: defined as a subset of the mITT Final Analysis Population of 
patients who had metastatic prostate cancer. Only the CRFS endpoint was analysed in this 
population, at the time of final analysis of the study. 
The per-protocol population was defined as those members of the mITT population who did not 
have important protocol deviations (IPDs). This population was used for sensitivity analysis of the 
mITT population for the primary efficacy endpoint. The per-protocol population and the associated 
subset of IPDs were identified prior to database lock. 
The safety population was defined as all randomized patients who received at least one dose of 
study drug. Unless otherwise specified, safety data were analysed by treatment group according to the 
actual treatment received (not the randomized treatment). The safety population was the primary 
population used for safety analyses. 
Efficacy analyses 
Stratified analyses incorporated the randomization stratification factors geographic region, presence of 
metastatic disease, and baseline age. If the group of patients from any of the individual randomization 
stratification factors (e.g., with presence of metastatic disease) comprised < 10% of the entire mITT 
population, this stratification factor was collapsed for stratified analyses. In addition, if there were < 15 
Assessment report  
EMA/218094/2022  
Page 78/176 
 
 
 
patients in one of the 12 strata, stratification factors of presence of metastatic disease and baseline 
age was used in the stratified analysis for more robust strata-adjusted estimation of treatment effect. 
For efficacy endpoints related to testosterone test results, analytical testosterone results from the 
central bioanalytical laboratory using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method, 
with a lower limit of quantification of 5 ng/dL, were used. Unless the endpoints were related to 
testosterone recovery, results from safety follow-up, 60-day and 90-day testosterone recovery were 
excluded from the efficacy analyses. 
Primary efficacy analysis 
Kaplan-Meier analysis and censoring rules 
In general, patients with testosterone escape (defined as any testosterone test result rising above the 
castrate level [≥ 50 ng/dL]) between Week 5 Day 1 through Week 49 Day 1 were considered as an 
event in the Kaplan-Meier analysis. The time from the date of the first dose to date of the first 
testosterone escape was considered as the event time. Patients who had not reached castrate level at 
Week 5 Day 1 were considered as having had an event at the target day of Week 5 Day 1. 
Patients who discontinued from the study prior to Week 5 Day 1 will be censored at the target day of 
Week 5 Day 1. In addition, patients without a Week 5 Day 1 assessment will be considered to have 
had an event at the target day of Week 5 Day 1. 
For patients reaching castrate levels at Week 5 Day 1, the following rules will be applied to the Kaplan-
Meier analysis for estimation of sustained castration rate with consideration for missed visits. Time to 
event or censoring, whichever occurs first, will be used in Kaplan-Meier analysis. 
a)  Patients who had one or more consecutive missed visits (i.e., a visit gap of > 42 days) and had 
a non-castrate assessment immediately after the missed visit(s) will be considered as having 
an escape at the target day of the earliest missed visit prior to the non-castrate assessment; 
b)  Patients with one missed visit who has a castrate assessment immediately before and after the 
missed visit will be assumed to be castrated at the missed visit; 
c)  Patients with two or more consecutive missed visits (i.e., a visit gap of > 70 days) and who 
had a castrate assessment immediately before and after the missed visits will be censored at 
the last available testosterone assessment prior to the missed visits. 
Note: A visit gap of 70 days for two missed visits was used to consider the duration between two 
expected visits (8 weeks), plus the visit windows allowed per protocol (7 days for each expected 
visit with a total of 2 weeks as visit window for two visits). A visit gap of 42 days for one missed 
visit was used to consider the visit of every 4 weeks, and ± 7 days as the visit window, per 
protocol. 
Otherwise, patients will be censored at the last available assessment prior to the follow-up visits, 
including patients who discontinue from the trial for reasons other than a non-castrate testosterone 
level. 
If the above censoring rules are applied to a patient in multiple instances, the date of the earliest 
censoring for missed visits will be used as the date of censoring. 
In addition, patients who had initiated therapies known to suppress testosterone will be censored at 
the time of last testosterone assessment prior to the initiation of such therapies. 
The time to event or censoring, whichever comes first, will be summarized by the Kaplan-Meier 
method. If the event time or censoring time is after Day 337, Day 337 will be used as the event time 
or censoring time.

Sensitivity analyses to the primary analysis 
To assess the robustness of the primary analysis for Evaluation Criteria 1 and 2, the following 
sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint were performed. 
•  Sensitivity Analysis 1: Analysis of the primary endpoint was repeated under the per-protocol 
population. 
•  Sensitivity Analysis 2: In addition to the censoring rules described above, patients who had 
received concomitant medications and herbal supplements that could possibly affect testosterone 
levels during study treatment were excluded from the analysis. 
•  Sensitivity Analysis 3: Patients who had missed two or more consecutive visits after Week 5 Day 
1 (above censoring rule c) or discontinued from the study early were considered to have an event 
at the target day of the earliest missed visit. 
•  Sensitivity Analysis 4: In order to assess the impact of delayed testosterone suppression to 
castrate level, analyses of the primary endpoint were repeated by considering that patients who 
had not reached castrate level at Week 5 Day 1, were censored at Week 5 Day 1. 
Subgroup analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint 
Subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint were performed to determine whether treatment 
effects were consistent across clinically important subgroups. Subgroups included but were not limited 
to geographic region, ethnicity, presence of metastatic disease, age, race, clinical disease presentation, 
Gleason score, baseline testosterone, and baseline PSA levels. The odds ratio (OR) and its 95% CI 
based on a logistic regression model were displayed in a forest plot for each subgroup. 
In addition, testosterone castration rates at Week 49 Day 1 (Day 337) for the two different dose levels 
(22.5 mg vs 11.25 mg) in the leuprolide group and their 95% CIs have been provided separately. 
Key secondary efficacy endpoints 
The primary and the key secondary efficacy analyses were performed at an overall two-sided type I 
error of 0.05. A test was deemed statistically significant if the two-sided p---value rounded to 4 
decimal places was less than 0.05. If the result of the primary endpoint analysis met the respective 
evaluation criterion of the primary endpoint, the key secondary endpoints were tested with a fixed-
sequence testing procedure (as illustrated in Table 10) to maintain the overall familywise error rate of 
0.05 for the testing of primary and key secondary endpoints. 
All p-values (if provided) aside from the endpoints listed in the testing order were not adjusted in 
multiplicity, thus were at a nominal level of 0.05.

a Castration resistance-free survival and time to testosterone recovery back to > 280 ng/dL at the 90-day follow-
up were to be tested at the final analysis only if all the preceding endpoints reached statistical significance in 
the primary analysis. Endpoints in the higher order were not updated with descriptive statistics in the final 
analysis. 
b Analysis of time to testosterone recovery was performed at the primary analysis for exploratory purposes 
without formal testing. Testing order of time to testosterone recovery in the final analysis was to be preceded 
by castration resistance-free survival; however, the testosterone recovery analysis was not formally tested at 
the final analysis, because the results for castration resistance-free survival did not achieve statistical 
superiority. 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints 
Other secondary endpoints (not for hierarchical hypothesis testing) included evaluation of the time 
course and magnitude of sustained profound castration (testosterone < 20 ng/dL), assessment of 
timing of testosterone recovery (back to ≥ 50 ng/dL and to ≥ 280 ng/dL or baseline), assessment of 
PSA response rate and time to PSA progression, FSH levels over time, and the impact of treatment on 
measures of patient reported outcomes. See also Table 9. 
For patient reported outcomes, three questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-PR25, and 
EuroQoL EQ-5D-5L) were completed by patients at baseline, every 2 to 3 months during the treatment 
period, and at the 30-day safety follow-up visit). They were also completed in the 60-day and 90-day 
testosterone recovery follow-up if patients were participating in the testosterone recovery follow up. 
Scores and change from baseline scores from each scale were summarized using a mixed model for 
repeated measures (EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-PR25) or descriptive statistics (EuroQoL EQ-5D-
5L). 
Exploratory efficacy endpoint 
For overall survival, the Kaplan-Meier method was used to describe survival distributions by treatment 
group. Patients were censored at the last contact date prior to data cut-off date if patient was known 
to be alive prior to database lock date. 
Changes in planned analysis 
There were no changes to the planned analysis primary analysis of the study after database lock (for 
the primary analysis). The following additional analyses were performed after the database lock for the 
primary analysis. No changes were made in the planned analyses of the final analysis. 
As the enrolment for the follow-up of testosterone recovery had been completed for the patients 
enrolled under protocol Amendment 2, an analysis of time to testosterone recovery back to > 280 
ng/dL at the 90-day follow-up was performed at the primary analysis, but for exploratory purposes 
Assessment report  
EMA/218094/2022

without formal testing. In the final analysis testing order, time to testosterone recovery (without any 
updates) was to be preceded by CRFS; however, the testosterone recovery analysis was not formally 
tested for the final analysis. See also footnote b of Table 10. 
To better understand the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), additional analyses 
of cardiovascular safety were conducted to provide further insight and context to the overall incidence 
of adverse cardiovascular events, including MACE, by treatment group. These analyses included MACE 
incidence by MACE medical history status, calculation of odds ratios to characterize the change in 
MACE risk within and between treatment groups, MACE rates derived from Kaplan-Meier methods and 
exposure-adjusted rates. Similar additional summarization was conducted for the incidence of ischemic 
heart disease. 
A broad post-hoc assessment of risk factors for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in all 
patients was conducted. The assessment included: 1) life-style related risk factors (including former or 
current use of tobacco, heavy alcohol use and body mass index > 30), 2) any cerebrovascular or 
cardiovascular risk factors (including medical history terms related to peripheral arterial disease, 
hypertension, dyslipidaemia, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis, endocarditis, 
mechanical valve replacement, chronic kidney disease, prior TIA, stroke or intracranial haemorrhage, 
prior myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic 
liver disease, carotid stenosis or occlusion, venous thromboembolism, heart failure and myopathies), 
and 3) any history of MACE (as determined by the Myocardial Infarction standardised MedDRA query 
[SMQ] [broad], Central Nervous System Haemorrhages and Cerebrovascular Conditions SMQ [broad], 
and deaths due to all causes). 
Results 
Unless stated otherwise, efficacy results of the primary analysis of study MVT-601-3201 are presented 
here. As is shown in Table 10, only the results of the key secondary endpoint CRFS were updated at 
the final analysis. 
Recruitment and participant flow 
For the primary analysis, the first patient was randomized (and dosed 18-Apr-2017 and the last patient 
completed the study 25-Oct-2019. The database lock date for the primary analysis was 10-Dec-2019. 
Patient disposition and primary reasons for early discontinuation of study drug are summarized in 
Figure 13. 
A total of 1327 patients were screened and 934 patients were randomized at 155 centres globally, 
including North and South America, Europe, and Asia and rest of world as part of the primary analysis. 
A total of 624 patients were randomized to receive relugolix and 310 patients were randomized to 
receive leuprolide. 
A total of four patients were randomized and not treated (two each in the relugolix and leuprolide 
groups). Two patients (one in each group) met exclusion criteria and were discontinued from the 
study. The other two patients withdrew consent before receiving study drug.

Conduct of study 
The original study protocol (dated 13-Jan-2017) and three amendments were submitted for review and 
approval by all IECs/IRBs before implementation. 
The primary purpose of Amendment 1 (dated 02-Jan-2018) was to provide clarification regarding entry 
criteria, prohibited medications, schedule of activities, and update on safety reporting. However, 
because of a typographical error in an exclusion criterion, the meaning of that criterion was 
inadvertently changed. This amendment was initially submitted to a regulatory authority, then 
withdrawn. The typographical error in the exclusion criterion was corrected and all other clarifications 
previously stated above were included in a new version, Amendment 2 (dated 18-Jan-2018, i.e. 16 
days later than Amendment 1). To alleviate the burden of study visits on participants, this amendment 
also eliminated the Day 22 visit, resulting in fewer patients having data at this visit compared with the 
rest of the study visits. All patients enrolled under the original protocol and Amendment 2 were part of 
the primary analysis to assess the safety and efficacy of relugolix in achieving castration within 4 
weeks and maintaining it over an additional 44 weeks. 
The primary purpose of Amendment 3 (dated 23-Oct-2018) was to include an additional alpha-
protected key secondary endpoint of CRFS, an important indicator of disease progression, in the final 
analysis. To support this analysis, the protocol allowed for an additional cohort of approximately 100 
patients with metastatic disease to be enrolled to ensure an appropriate level of statistical power for 
the analysis (targeting ~390 metastatic patients in total including those enrolled with the initial cohort 
of 925 patients). The choice to enrich the study with metastatic patients was due to the higher 
incidence of castration resistance in patients with metastatic disease. In addition, to support 
registration in China, a target number of 138 metastatic and nonmetastatic patients from China 
(enrolled in China and Taiwan) was specified, including those enrolled in Taiwan as part of the initial 
cohort of 915 patients. 
As a result of the protocol amendments, this study has two planned analyses: the primary and the final 
analyses, see Statistical methods.

Percentages are based on the total number of patients in the modified intent-to-treat population for each treatment 
group or total. 
a Disease stage at study entry is defined based on TNM stage at study entry, M1 as metastatic, T3/4 NX M0 or N1 
M0 and any T N1 M0 as locally advanced, and T1 or T2 N0 M0 as localized. Because the disease stage information 
was collected on the eCRF, the data were not affected by interactive voice/web recognition system errors. 
b Gleason score is determined by adding primary and secondary Gleason scores together. 
c One patient in the leuprolide group was given an ECOG score of 3 at screening due to the use of crutches as a 
result of a surgical vascular procedure on his leg. By baseline on Day 1, the patient no longer needed crutches and 
his ECOG score had improved to 0. 
For the mITT Final Analysis Population, the disease-specific baseline characteristics of patients were 
consistent between the treatment groups. As a results of Amendment 3, the mITT Final Analysis 
Population was enriched for patients with metastatic disease compared to the mITT at primary analysis 
(data not shown). For the metastatic patients in the mITT Final Analysis Population (the mITT 
Metastatic Patient Population), the disease-specific baseline characteristics were also similar between 
the treatment groups. Overall, disease-specific baseline characteristics for metastatic patients were 
consistent with a high burden of disease (data not shown). 
Prior and concomitant medical therapies that could alter testosterone or PSA levels 
Prior and concomitant therapies for prostate cancer include ADT, therapies that could alter 
testosterone or PSA levels, and radiation therapy. 
Prior androgen deprivation therapy 
A small percentage of patients had used prior ADT (11.9%), with 13.0% in the relugolix group and 
9.7% in the leuprolide group  
Table 13).

Concomitant therapies that could alter testosterone or PSA levels 
Various concomitant therapies may have the potential to alter testosterone or PSA levels and therefore 
could have affected the interpretation of the efficacy data in this study. As such, therapies that were 
likely to affect analysis of efficacy were identified. 
Therapies known to suppress testosterone 
Therapies known to suppress testosterone were prohibited medications during the study but could be 
started on or after Week 49. Overall, 15 patients (1.6%) took at least one therapy known to suppress 
testosterone during treatment, and all of these patients were in the leuprolide group. Almost all cases 
(14 of the 15 patients) concerned ADT given as the subsequent therapy to continue their ADT regimen, 
but because of variations in Week 49 Day 1 visit scheduling, these therapies were given less than 12 
weeks after the last leuprolide injection on study, and were therefore, captured as concomitant 
medications. One patient (in the leuprolide group) received leuprolide before Week 49, which was a 
protocol deviation. 
Antiandrogen therapies 
As expected, more patients in the leuprolide group received antiandrogen therapy (allowed per the 
protocol) initiated during the first 4 weeks of study treatment (23.4%) than in the relugolix group 
(0.2%) to manage clinical flare. One patient (0.2%) in the relugolix group initiated bicalutamide 
therapy on Day 5, the same day that the patient withdrew and early terminated from the study. 
Therapies that could possibly affect testosterone 
Overall, 125 patients (13.4%) took at least one concomitant medication or herbal supplement that 
could possibly affect testosterone. More patients in the leuprolide group (30.5%) took at least one 
therapy compared with the relugolix group (5.0%). Bicalutamide (allowed per the protocol) was the 
most frequently used therapy in the leuprolide group (26.6%), and for the majority of patients this 
antiandrogen therapy was initiated in the first 4 weeks for the prevention of initial flare for 4 weeks or 
longer (23.1%, see above). Enzalutamide was the most frequently used therapy in the relugolix group 
(17 patients; 2.7%) and similarly used in the leuprolide group (6 patients; 1.9%). Megestrol, 
medroxyprogesterone, and cyproterone were prohibited medications on study, but were used for the 
treatment of hot flush and/or appetite stimulant in both groups (by less than 1% of patients). 
Abiraterone (four patients [1.3%] in the leuprolide group), goserelin (two patients [0.6%] in the 
leuprolide group), and degarelix (one patient [0.3%] in the leuprolide group) were prohibited 
alternative treatments for prostate cancer, and all patients who used these medications on study 
received IPDs and were discontinued from the study. There were two patients who used herbals 
containing glycyrrhiza glabra (liquorice) on study: one patient (0.2%) in the relugolix and one (0.3%) 
in the leuprolide group. 
To assess the impact of concomitant medications and herbals that could possibly affect testosterone, a 
sensitivity analysis (Sensitivity Analysis 2) of the primary endpoint was performed excluding all such 
patients. 
Therapies that could possibly affect prostate-specific antigen 
All systemic therapies, except for ADT, used for the treatment of prostate cancer were included in this 
list. In addition to the information provided above under the previous heading, docetaxel (allowed per 
protocol after 2 months of study initiation) was used in similar proportions of patients in both groups 
(1.3% [n=8] in the relugolix group and 1.6% [n=6] in the leuprolide group). 
Prior and concomitant radiation therapy 
Assessment report  
EMA/218094/2022  
Page 88/176 
 
 
 
The majority of patients who received radiation therapy after study treatment initiation was in the 
primary setting (9.6% in the relugolix group and 12.0% in the leuprolide group, 10.4% overall). All but 
three patients received radiation therapy to the prostate bed after 2 months of initiating ADT, in line 
with the protocol. The three patients who started radiotherapy to the prostate bed (in either primary or 
salvage setting) less than 2 months after study initiation (all three in the relugolix group) were deemed 
protocol deviations. The use of radiotherapy in the palliative setting was similar across the two groups 
(3.9% in the relugolix group and 3.2% in the leuprolide group).

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint – sustained castration rate 
This study had two separate evaluation criteria for the primary efficacy endpoint to support different 
regulatory requirements for assessing efficacy (Table 9). The study successfully met its primary 
endpoint based on both evaluation criteria. 
A summary of the primary endpoint analysis is presented in Table 16. An overview of the Kaplan-
Meier- Analysis for sustained castration rate is presented by treatment group in Figure 14.

According to the testing strategy (Table 10), CRFS in all patients (with or without metastatic prostate

patients did not achieve statistical superiority (see above). This endpoint was thus analysed as 
exploratory.

Key secondary efficacy endpoint – testosterone recovery (back to > 280 ng/dL) 
As the enrolment for the follow-up of testosterone recovery had been completed for the patients 
enrolled under protocol Amendment 2, an analysis of time to testosterone recovery back to > 280 
ng/dL at the 90-day follow-up was performed at the primary analysis, but for exploratory purposes 
without formal testing. Though, because the results for CRFS in patients with metastatic disease did 
not achieve statistical superiority (see above), testosterone recovery was not to be formally tested/was 
to be analysed as exploratory at the primary analysis as well (see testing order and timing of analysis 
in Table 10. 
By the 90-day follow-up visit, 43.8% (60/137) of patients in the relugolix group compared with 4.3% 
(2/47 patients) in the leuprolide group had testosterone recovery to > 280 ng/dL. 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints 
For brevity, the results for the other (non-key) secondary efficacy endpoints (that were not part of the 
hierarchical testing order) are not reported here, except for the impact of treatment on measures of 
patient reported outcomes/quality of life, which is reported in a concise manner. 
Other secondary efficacy endpoint – patient-reported outcomes/quality of life 
In general, there were no notable differences between treatment groups in the results of the EORTC-
QLQ-C30 assessments that were clinically meaningful or unexpected on study. EORTC-QLQ-C30 was 
not designed specifically to evaluate patients with prostate cancer.

In general, there were no notable differences between treatment groups in the results of the EORTC-
QLQ-PR25 assessments that were clinically meaningful or unexpected during treatment on study. At 
the 90-day follow-up visit, the score for the hormonal treatment-related symptoms domain was 
numerically lower in the relugolix group compared with the leuprolide group, indicating less severity of 
hormonal treatment-related symptoms. However, the mean scores of sexual activity and of sexual 
functioning were similar between the two treatment groups at the 90-day follow-up visit, and all other 
domains in the assessment (urinary symptoms, incontinence aid use, and bowel symptoms) were 
comparable between the two treatment groups as well. 
Regarding the results of the of the EQ-5D-5L assessments, the proportions of patients who had 
deterioration, no change or improvement in each domain, were similar across the two treatment 
groups throughout the study. The visual analog scores (VAS) were also similar across the two 
treatment groups. 
Exploratory efficacy endpoint – overall survival 
For brevity, the results for this exploratory efficacy endpoint are reported in a concise manner. Refer to 
the Clinical AR for more information/results. 
The survival rates (95% CI) at Day 337 were 0.9885 (0.9761, 0.9945) in the relugolix group and 
0.9740 (0.9486, 0.9869) in the leuprolide group, with a difference of 0.0146 (0.0051, 0.0343). The 22 
deaths in the overall survival analysis comprise 16 patients who died due to a treatment emergent AE 
during the study (see Clinical safety), one patient who died after the AE reporting period, and five 
patients reported during the health status survey as having died after the study and before database 
lock (four in the relugolix group and one patient in the leuprolide group). 
Ancillary analyses 
Primary efficacy endpoint – sustained castration rate 
Sensitivity analyses 
A total of four pre-specified sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the primary 
analyses (for both Criterion 1 and Criterion 2), see also Statistical methods. The results of these 
sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint are provided in Table 22.

final analysis was to be preceded by castration resistance-free survival (see Table 10); 
however, the testosterone recovery analysis was not formally tested at the final analysis, 
because the results for castration resistance-free survival did not achieve statistical

a Except for four patients who did not receive study drug (two patients in each

b Study MVT-601-3201 had two separate evaluation criteria for the primary efficacy 
endpoint to support different global regulatory requirements for assessing benefit: 
• 
Evaluation Criterion 1 was a regulatory requirement from the FDA and was the trial 
success criterion for the primary efficacy endpoint. 
Evaluation Criterion 2, the primary efficacy endpoint required by EMA, was the first 
to be tested in the order of ranked key secondary endpoints to assess non-
inferiority of relugolix compared with leuprolide after Evaluation Criterion 1 was 
passed.

final analysis was to be preceded by castration resistance-free survival (see Table 10); 
however, the testosterone recovery analysis was not formally tested at the final 
analysis, because the results for castration resistance-free survival did not achieve 
statistical superiority.

2.6.5.5.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Not applicable. No pooling of data across studies was performed for the efficacy analyses due to 
differences in the definition of the primary endpoints and the much smaller size of the supportive 
phase 2 studies (see Supportive studies below) relative to the phase 3 study. Plus, results from 
study C27003 could not be pooled with those from MVT-601-3201 given the different patient 
populations enrolled in the studies. 
2.6.5.6.  Supportive study(ies) 
The relugolix clinical development program (Table 2) includes the following supportive studies: the 
phase 2 study C27003; the phase 2 study C27002; and the phase 1 study TB-AK160108. 
Phase 2 study C27003 
Methods 
Design: C27003 (NCT02135445; Dearnaley et al. Eur Urol. 2020) is a two-arm, randomized, open 
label, parallel-group study in patients with localized prostate cancer of intermediate risk and for whom 
6 months of neoadjuvant/adjuvant ADT to external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) was indicated. The 
assessment of appropriate risk for short-term (6 months) ADT was at the discretion of the investigator 
and/or treating radiation oncologist. Intermediate risk per NCCN guidelines included one of the 
following: T2b-T2c disease; or Gleason score 7; or PSA 10 to 20 ng/mL. Depending upon physician 
judgment and as per NCCN guidelines, the presence of more than one intermediate-risk criteria may 
have been an indication for longer-term ADT, outside the scope of this study.

Patients were randomized (3:2) to relugolix 120 mg once daily (after a single oral loading dose of 
320 mg) (N = 65) or to degarelix 80 mg subcutaneously every four weeks for 24 weeks (after a single 
loading dose of 240 mg) (N = 38). 
Objective and endpoints: The primary endpoint was the rate of effective castration between Week 5 
Day 1 (Day 29) to Week 25 Day 1 (Day 169) as determined by the estimated proportion of patients 
who had testosterone concentrations < 50 ng/dL at all scheduled visits. Castration rate was estimated 
using a 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) and the primary objective was to demonstrate sustained 
castration in > 90% of patients. Secondary endpoints were testosterone and PSA kinetics, changes in 
prostate gland size, quality of life, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. No formal 
statistical differences were sought or hypothesized between relugolix and degarelix. The Safety 
Population, defined as all patients who received at least one dose of any study drug, was used for all 
efficacy and safety analyses. 
Results 
Participants: Sixty-five patients in the relugolix group and 38 patients in the degarelix group were 
included in the Safety Population. 
Demographics and other baseline characteristics: Overall, demographics were similar between 
the treatment groups. The majority of patients were white (89% in the relugolix group, 82% in the 
degarelix group) and the mean (SD) age of patients was 70.2 (5.65) years in the relugolix group and 
70.3 (6.97) years in the degarelix group. Almost all patients in this study were receiving radiotherapy 
with neoadjuvant/adjuvant ADT as the primary (first line) therapy for their prostate cancer. The mean 
prostate gland size (SD) was 42005.4 mm3 (19475.26) in the relugolix group and 50084.8 mm3 
(27974.97) in the degarelix group. 
Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint for relugolix was met with a 95.4% (95% CI: 87.1%, 99.0%) rate of effective 
castration. In the degarelix group, the effective rate of castration was 89.5% (95% CI: 75.2%, 
97.1%). 
Secondary endpoints 
For brevity, the results for the secondary endpoints are not described here. Refer to the Clinical AR for 
these results. 
Phase 2 study C27002 
Methods 
Design: C27002 (NCT02083185) is a three-arm, randomized, open-label, parallel-group dose-finding 
study of relugolix in patients with advanced hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, with a leuprolide 
observational cohort. Relugolix was administered starting with a 320-mg loading dose on Day 1 
followed (beginning on Day 2) by a maintenance dose of 80 or 120 mg daily (QD). 
This study enrolled adult men with prostate cancer who were candidates for ADT for the management 
of hormone-sensitive prostate cancer with one of the following clinical disease states: (1) advanced 
localized disease not suitable for primary therapy, (2) evidence of PSA biochemical or clinical relapse 
following primary surgery or radiation therapy of curative intent, or (3) newly diagnosed metastatic 
disease that was asymptomatic or not threatening to vital organs. Patients were randomized 2:2:1 to 
receive either relugolix (2 dosing groups, see above) or leuprolide. 
Assessment report  
EMA/218094/2022  
Page 110/176 
 
 
 
 
Objectives and endpoints: The study’s primary endpoint was the rate of effective castration between 
Week 5, Day 1 (Day 29) to Week 25, Day 1 (Day 169) inclusive, defined as the estimated proportion of 
patients who have testosterone concentrations <50 ng/dL at all scheduled visits. Castration rate was 
estimated using a 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) and the primary objective was to demonstrate 
sustained castration in > 90% of patients. The secondary endpoints included safety, testosterone and 
PSA kinetics, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and quality of life. No formal statistical differences 
were sought or hypothesized either between the two relugolix dosing arms or between relugolix and 
leuprolide. The Safety Population, defined as all patients who received at least one dose of any study 
drug, was used for all efficacy and safety analyses. 
Results 
Participants: A total of 134 patients were enrolled into one of three groups to receive oral relugolix 
for up to 48 weeks at doses of 80 mg (N = 56) or 120 mg (N = 54) orally once daily (after a single oral 
loading dose of 320 mg), or into a reference control group to receive GnRH receptor agonist therapy 
(leuprolide, 22.5 mg subcutaneous every 12 weeks, N = 24). 
Demographics and other baseline characteristics: Demographics were similar among the 
treatment groups. The majority of patients were white (80% in the combined relugolix groups, 100% 
in the leuprolide group). The mean (SD) age of patients was 72.2 (8.64) years in the combined 
relugolix groups and 68.3 (6.77) years in the leuprolide group. At study entry, ≤ 15% of patients 
across study groups had evidence of distal metastases (M1 disease), although information on 
metastatic status was not available for more than 50% of patients in the relugolix groups. 
Primary endpoint 
Effective castration (testosterone < 50 ng/dL) was achieved and maintained between the Week 5 
Day 1 (Day 29) to Week 25 Day 1 (Day 169) visit for each treatment group as follows: relugolix 80 mg 
group, 91.1% [95% CI: 80.4%, 97.0%]; relugolix 120 mg group, 90.7% [95% CI: 79.7%, 96.9%]; 
and leuprolide group, 95.8% [95% CI: 78.9%, 99.9%]). The study did not meet the primary endpoint, 
since the lower bounds of the 95% CIs for both relugolix doses were not > 90%. This outcome is likely 
driven by the small sample size affecting the statistical power for this assessment. 
Secondary endpoints 
For brevity, the results for the secondary endpoints are not described here. 
Phase 1 study TB-AK1601082 
Methods 
Design: Study TB-AK160108 (NCT02141659; Suzuki et al. Cancer Med. 2019) is an open-label, dose-
range-finding study that evaluated the tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 
relugolix in 43 hormone treatment-naïve Japanese patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer. 
The study consisted of a dose-escalation phase (Part A) and a 96week expansion phase (Part B). In 
Part A (N = 13), a loading dose of relugolix (320 or 360 mg) was administered on Day 1 followed by 
once daily oral dosing on Days 2 through 28, with the dosage dependent on tolerability in each 
individual Cohort of 3 to 4 patients. In Part B, 30 patients received a maximum of 96 weeks of 
treatment at doses of 80 or 120 mg once daily (N = 15, each group), with a loading dose of 320 mg on 
Day 1. An overview of the study is show in  
Table 26.

a After completing 48 weeks of treatment, patients were able to continue receiving drug up to a total of 96 weeks, 
at the discretion of the of the investigator and depending on the wishes of the patient. 
Objective and endpoints: The primary objectives of the study were to evaluate the safety and 
tolerability of relugolix in hormone treatment-naïve patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer. The 
secondary objectives were to evaluate relugolix pharmacokinetics, its effects on serum testosterone, 
and the change over time in PSA levels. 
Results 
Participants: This study enrolled 43 adult Japanese men with prostate cancer who had not yet 
received hormone therapy. In total, the Full/Safety Analysis Set in Part A of the study comprised 13 
patients and in Part B 30 patients (15 in each dosing group, see  
Table 26). 
Demographics and other baseline characteristics: The mean age (SD) of the 30 patients in Part B 
of the study was 74.5 (5.10). All were Japanese and had non-metastatic disease. 
Primary endpoint 
The results for the safety and tolerability of relugolix are not reported here (see Clinical safety). 
Secondary endpoints 
In Part A, following the loading dose on Day 1, substantial decreases in mean testosterone 
concentrations in all cohorts were observed on Day 2. Mean testosterone concentrations were below 
the 50 ng/dL castration threshold level by Day 3 for Cohorts 1, 2, and 3, and by Day 7 for Cohort 4. 
Testosterone concentrations of all of the patients, except 1 patient in Cohort 2 who discontinued the 
study after the first dose, dropped below the 50 ng/dL castration threshold level by Day 2 to Day 14 
and continued below this threshold level until Day 31 (i.e., 3 days after the last dose). 
In Part B, following the loading dose on Day 1, substantial decreases in mean testosterone 
concentrations in both groups were observed on Week 1 Day 2 (Day 2). Mean testosterone 
concentrations were below the 50 ng/dL castration threshold level by Week 1 Day 4 (Day 4), at the 
latest for both groups. Testosterone concentrations of all of the patients dropped below the 50 ng/dL 
castration threshold level by Week 1 Day 2 (Day 2) to Week 3 Day 1 (Day 15) and continued below 
this threshold level until Week 25 Day 1 (Day 169). Testosterone reduction by both doses of relugolix 
was sustained through 96 weeks. 
For brevity, only the results for the secondary endpoint of testosterone suppression are reported here.

2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The relugolix clinical development program in prostate cancer consists of the pivotal phase 3 study 
MVT-601-3201 and the supportive phase 2 studies C27003 and C27002, plus the phase 1 study TB-
AK160108. This clinical development program appears generally acceptable. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Pivotal study. The design of study MVT-601-3201 was in general considered acceptable at SA 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/742698/2015) and this can be agreed. 
Patient population. The patients enrolled in the pivotal study were not candidates for surgical or 
radiation therapy with curative intent. The eligibility criteria of study MVT-601-3201 are in general 
considered acceptable, except for the following. 
At SA it was considered that including subgroups of patients with 1) evidence of biochemical (PSA) or 
clinical relapse following primary intervention with curative intent; and 2) newly diagnosed androgen 
sensitive metastatic disease, seems appropriate for the definition of the population according to the 
aimed therapeutic indication. However, at SA there was a point of critique on also including a subgroup 
of patients with 3) advanced localized disease unlikely to be cured by local primary intervention with 
either surgery or radiation with curative intent. This criterion 3) defines a subpopulation that is 
different from the other patients allowed in the trial and the rationale for including these patients was 
not fully understood. Furthermore, the criteria defining unsuitability of locoregional treatment at the 
time of enrolment appear not to be specified, and they are probably difficult to define in an objective 
manner. Therefore, the inclusion of subgroup 3) was discouraged because it was expected to confound 
the interpretation of study results, although mainly in relation to secondary endpoints. It is noted that 
the Applicant has decided not to follow this part of the SA. It is also noted that, whereas the treatment 
of patients with continuous ADT per criteria 1) and 2) seems to be in line with current clinical 
guidelines (2021 EAU Guidelines on prostate cancer; 2020 ESMO Prostate cancer guidelines), for 
criterion 3) this is considered uncertain. Then again, as the inclusion of subgroup 3) unlikely has any 
impact on the primary outcome of the study and is also considered of little relevance for the (wording 
of the) indication, it is acceptable nonetheless. 
Patients had to have an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. This is reflected in section 5.1 of the 
SmPC. 
Relugolix dose selection. The Applicant’s rationale for the proposed posology for relugolix is 
acceptable. The proposed posology was also discussed at the time of SA where the CHMP answered 
that this posology seemed appropriate to ensure the treatment goal (i.e. > 90% of patients achieving 
and maintaining medical castration through the end of treatment). 
Comparator. At SA, it was remarked that based on the similar mechanism of action, the GnRH 
antagonist degarelix would be the most obvious comparator. It was, however, acknowledged that the 
uptake of degarelix in daily practice may have been relatively low due to a number of reasons. 
Therefore, from a scientific point of view, the leuprolide comparator was acceptable at the time. With 
regards to the dose and route of administration of leuprolide, it was considered preferable to select a 
single dose, which should ideally ensure the best compromise between the maximum expected effect 
on testosterone lowering and safety. Nevertheless, it was acknowledged that the use of different doses 
seems unavoidable in a global trial setting. However, it was considered imperative to demonstrate that 
there are no efficacy differences across the various leuprolide dose regimens at the time of 
registration. 
At present, the uptake in clinical practice of the GnRH antagonist degarelix has not changed 
importantly since at the time of SA. Leuprolide is (still) a recommended, standard of care treatment 
Assessment report  
EMA/218094/2022  
Page 113/176 
 
 
 
 
option and its use as a comparator is thus acceptable. The results of the subgroup analysis of the 
different leuprolide dose levels will be viewed with special interest. 
Primary endpoint. At the time of SA, the Applicant proposed as the primary endpoint of the study the 
probability of testosterone ≤ 50 ng/dL while on study treatment from Week 5 Day 1 through Week 48 
Day 7, which seems to correspond to Evaluation Criterion 1 (see Table 9). The CHMP considered this 
primary endpoint acceptable. 
In chapter 2 of Appendix 4 to the guideline on the evaluation of anticancer medicinal products in man 
that contains condition-specific guidance on prostate cancer (EMA/CHMP/703715/2012 Rev. 2), the 
following is stated in the section on therapy for metastatic disease (hormone-naïve). For medicinal 
products aiming at achieving medical castration, it is sufficient to convincingly demonstrate the 
achievement and maintenance of castrate levels of testosterone in the absence of breakthroughs and 
micro-surges. It is also stated that if the aim is to achieve “surgical level” of castration, 20 ng/dL and 
below, clinical benefit should be demonstrated in a randomized trial vs. standard therapy (target 
50 ng/dL and below) if the benefit of a lower serum testosterone target level cannot be demonstrated 
by other means. 
Moreover, already in 2007 the following was concluded by the CHMP in the Vantas Article 29(4) referral 
procedure (CHMP/247760/07, see Annex II): the achievement of castrate levels of testosterone 
(serum testosterone < 50 ng/dL) is an acceptable primary efficacy endpoint in patients with hormone 
sensitive advanced prostate cancer. Vantas is an implant containing the GnRH agonist histrelin acetate. 
When taking the above in account, it thus seems that Evaluation Criterion 1 could also be considered 
the regulatory requirement for the EMA and it is uncertain why the Applicant assumes otherwise. It is, 
however, noted that the primary endpoint is of pharmacodynamic nature and is not a clinical measure 
of patient benefit per se. 
The -10% non-inferiority margin is acceptable, primarily as it is based on regulatory precedence of the 
pivotal assessment of the GnRH receptor antagonist degarelix versus leuprolide (Firmagon MAA EPAR). 
At SA, no specific remarks on the -10% non-inferiority margin were made. 
Secondary endpoints. At SA, the proposed secondary endpoints were considered acceptable. It is 
noted though, that apart from the (key) secondary endpoint of castration resistance-free survival 
(CRFS) all alpha-protected secondary endpoints that were tested hierarchically are of 
pharmacodynamic nature or concern a biomarker (PSA as a surrogate endpoint), and are not clinical 
measures of patient benefit per se. It is also noted that the quality of life endpoints are not alpha-
protected and not for hierarchical testing. Lastly, it is noted that at the time of SA the proposed study 
design included an optional extension treatment period of an additional 48 weeks (for both treatment 
arms). This extension treatment period was apparently later dropped, as it was not/no longer included 
in the original study protocol (dated 13-Jan-2017). 
Statistical methods. Study MVT-601--3201 enrolled a total of 3 cohorts of patients and both a 
primary and a final analysis were conducted. The primary analysis included the results of patients from 
Cohort 1 only and these are considered key for benefit-risk assessment. The sample size (calculation) 
of 915 treated patients at the primary analysis (in Cohort 1) was considered adequate at SA. The 
choice to use the results of Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 (additional patients with metastatic disease) is 
acceptable. With protocol Amendment 3 the Applicant chose to enrich the study with metastatic 
patients for the secondary endpoint of CRFS (to be analysed at the final analysis) due to an assumed 
higher incidence of castration resistance (PSA progression) in patients with metastatic disease. This 
can be understood- and is acceptable, also as CRFS is a rather ‘low-ranked’ secondary endpoint (see 
Table 10). Results of the efficacy analysis in the China cohort (Cohort 3) were not included in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/218094/2022  
Page 114/176 
 
 
 
 
primary analysis CSR and are therefore not included in this assessment report, and thus not discussed 
here. 
The 2:1 randomization ratio is acceptable, but given the trial is open-label, there was a risk of (early) 
dropout/censoring in the leuprolide (control) arm, which will preclude the observation of some events 
in this arm. Reassuringly, there was very little early dropout/censoring in the leuprolide (control) arm 
(see Figure 13). 
The three stratification factors, i.e. geographic region; presence of metastatic disease; and age, are 
acceptable. As the dose of leuprolide in Japan, Taiwan, and China is 11.25 mg instead of the 22.5 mg 
in other countries, the stratification factor geographic region is considered an important one. See also 
above at Comparator. Apart from this, no major prognostic effect of all three stratification factors is 
expected on the pharmacodynamic outcomes of the study, including the primary endpoint. 
In light of the different administration routes of relugolix (oral) and leuprolide (SC or IM injection), the 
open-label study design is acceptable. The Applicant provided a detailed description of the data access 
restrictions that were put in place for study MVT-601-3201 to minimize bias and protect trial integrity 
in the context of an open-label trial. Based on the information provided, it is noted that the blinded 
team consisted of a statistician in charge of writing the SAP and a programmer. The rest of the study 
team was unblinded. In this context, and despite the level of restrictions described by the Applicant, it 
is difficult to exclude any data-driven decisions once the study was ongoing. In particular, it is noted 
that all functions other than biostatistics involved in the development of the SAP were unblinded at the 
time of its late finalisation. 
All analysis populations can be acceptable. The use of the mITT population as the primary population 
for efficacy endpoints, i.e. excluding patients who were randomized but not treated, is acceptable as 
only two patients in each treatment group were excluded (see Figure 13). 
At the time of SA the CHMP considered the statistical methods based on the Kaplan-Meier analysis 
adequate to evaluate the relugolix efficacy using the cumulative probability of sustained testosterone 
suppression. The associated predefined decision rules were considered adequate as well. The proposed 
censoring mechanisms and the imputation rules applied to the intent-to-treat population were 
endorsed. It was advised that sensitivity analyses needed to be clearly pre-specified in the protocol 
(not provided at the time) including a per-protocol analysis and different censoring rules. Generally this 
advice was followed. Censoring rules deviate somewhat from the advice, they are somewhat simplified 
but are still considered reasonable, the main difference is in the handling of relugolix and leuprolide 
adherence. Since the compliance was generally high, this is not of concern. Sensitivity analyses were 
specified in the SAP. Although their description is rather short, they do test main assumptions of the 
primary analysis model and are agreed. Some inconsistency is, however, noted between the protocol 
and the SAP regarding the censoring rules. The brief protocol description states that subjects who 
discontinue treatment prior to observing an event will be “censored at the last testosterone 
assessment prior to discontinuation”, whereas the SAP describes that “patients who discontinued from 
the study prior to Week 5 Day 1 will be censored at the target day of Week 5 Day 1”. The Applicant 
explained that the censoring rule for patients who discontinued treatment prior to Week 5 Day 1 was 
updated based on feedback received by the FDA. A sensitivity analysis was provided based on the 
per-protocol description, i.e. with patients censored at the last testosterone assessment prior to 
discontinuation, and the results of this sensitivity analysis were consistent with the primary analysis. 
The performed subgroup analyses, including for the two different dose levels (22.5 mg vs 11.25 mg) in 
the leuprolide group, are acceptable. 
At the time of SA, the sequential scheme for both superiority and non-inferiority primary comparisons 
and for the secondary endpoints was considered valid to control the overall type I error rate. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/218094/2022  
Page 115/176 
 
 
 
 
methods for the statistical analysis of the secondary endpoints proposed by the Applicant (at the time) 
were considered adequate. This still is the case. Of note, no hypotheses were pre-specified in the 
protocol or SAP for the secondary endpoints. However, it was assumed that these were standard 
superiority hypotheses. 
Study conduct. Regarding the additional analyses performed after the database lock for the primary 
analysis, the following remarks are made. It is noted that additional analyses of cardiovascular safety 
were conducted post hoc. The Applicant states that a safety analysis of adverse cardiovascular events, 
including MACE and ischemic heart disease, was prespecified for study MVT-601--3201 (see-Clinical 
safety). However, no such analysis is mentioned in the protocol. In the SAP, the AE category of 
adverse cardiovascular events that includes both MACE and ischemic heart disease is mentioned, but 
no specific statistical safety analysis is indicated, nor is any safety analysis included in the hierarchical 
testing order (Table 10). At SA the Applicant proposed rate of MACE as a secondary endpoint and the 
CHMP at the time suggested that risk factors for cardiovascular events were to be assessed at baseline 
and concomitant medications reported in order to avoid imbalances in the analysis of MACE and allow 
proper interpretation of the results. For further discussion on this matter, refer to Discussion on clinical 
safety. 
The (three) amendments to the protocol are unlikely to have (had) a major impact on the study results 
(especially of the primary analysis that is considered key for benefit-risk assessment) or the scientific 
validity of the study. They could, therefore, be acceptable. Then again, several important changes to 
the statistical methods were done as part of protocol Amendment 3 (addition of key secondary 
endpoint, additional metastatic patient cohort, distinction between primary and final analyses). In 
addition, the first SAP, which provides details of the fixed-sequence testing procedure and all planned 
analyses, was only effective when the primary analysis data were near complete (and several revisions 
were made subsequently). Due to the open-label nature of the study, data driven decisions cannot be 
ruled out. Therefore, the Applicant was requested to comment on the impact of the protocol 
amendments and of the late SAP finalisation/revisions on the trial integrity and overall control of the 
type I error, especially for the key secondary endpoints. According to the Applicant, the decisions to 
add new endpoints and the ordering of the secondary endpoints in the fixed-sequence testing 
procedure were based on the review of historical data. In addition, it is argued that the study data 
blinding plan ensures the study integrity and the overall control of the type I error. It was understood 
that FDA comments on the SAP resulted in subsequent revisions. However, as discussed above, the 
blinded team consisted of the statistician writing the SAP and a programmer only, and the rest of the 
study team was unblinded. Despite other data access restrictions, it is difficult to completely rule out 
any data-driven decisions in the context of an open-label study. More specifically, the late ranking of 
the confirmatory secondary endpoints in the SAP could be of concern, leading to a potential inflation of 
the study type I error. This is an issue that cannot be addressed retrospectively, so it will not be 
pursued further. Plus, although undesirable, this issue does not concern the primary endpoint of the 
study and it is thus not considered key for B/R assessment. 
The overall rate of important protocol deviations (IPDs) of 21.9% could be considered rather high, but 
the following remarks are made. 
There were amongst others IPDs due to administrative issues and IPDs due to patients receiving 
prohibited concomitant medications. For these the (results of) the performed sensitivity and subgroup 
analyses should provide reassurance. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis was performed using the per 
protocol population excluding all patients with IPDs. 
Other IPDs were due to the sponsor not communicating to investigators non-castrate levels (on or 
after Week 5 Day 1 [Day 29]) that were detected centrally by the more sensitive liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. According to the Applicant, these IPDs did not 
Assessment report  
EMA/218094/2022

have either an urgent or actual impact on patient safety or on the scientific validity of the study. 
Primarily, as according to the Applicant investigators had enough resources available to them to make 
actual treatment decisions for study patients in line with best clinical practice and professional 
guidelines. This is acceptable. Investigators did have available PSA levels at every visit and total 
testosterone levels (measured per standard assays) at Week 5, Week 25, and Week 49. This is 
considered sufficient, as it is in line with current guideline recommendations for the follow-up of men 
on ADT (2021 EAU Guidelines on prostate cancer). Moreover, it is standard clinical practice that a 
rising PSA prompts the assessment of the testosterone level and this was available to be drawn at any 
unscheduled visit per the investigator's discretion. This was the case for more patients in the leuprolide 
group than in the relugolix group. However, the observed difference can be explained by the delay in 
achieving testosterone suppression in patients in the leuprolide group compared with the relugolix 
group, i.e. the fact that testosterone suppression occurs later with leuprolide treatment compared with 
relugolix treatment. 
All in all, it is considered unlikely that the IPDs had a significant impact on the study results or the 
scientific validity of the study. Plus, the results of the performed sensitivity and subgroup analyses 
should provide reassurance. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Recruitment. It is noted that that 29.6% of patients assessed for eligibility failed screening, primarily 
due to not meeting eligibility criteria. This could suggest that the eligibility criteria, in particular the 
exclusion criteria, were rather strict. 
Approximately 90% of patients in both study arms completed the 48 weeks of treatment. The ~10% of 
patients who discontinued/withdrew from the study early, primarily due to AEs or withdrawal by 
patient (70% of patients who discontinued), is acceptable. 
Baseline demographic and disease-specific characteristics. Patient demographics and disease 
specific baseline characteristics were in general similar between treatment groups in study MVT-
6013201. Any (small) differences observed are unlikely of influence on the study results, especially on 
the primary endpoint. Moreover, these patient characteristics can be considered representative of the 
intended target population. No major differences seem apparent- between the primary analysis patient 
population and the -mITT- Final Analysis Population (or the mITT Metastatic Patient Population) that 
were used for analysis of the rather ‘low-ranked’ (see Table 10), key secondary CRFS endpoints only. 
Subgroup 3) of patients with advanced localized disease unlikely to be cured by local primary 
intervention with either surgery or radiation with curative intent, the subgroup of which inclusion was 
discouraged at SA, comprised 27.1% of patients. 
The reported prior and concomitant medical therapies that could alter testosterone levels are 
considered of no/unlikely influence on the study results, especially on the primary endpoint. Regarding 
the influence on the PSA endpoints of the reported concomitant medical therapies that could possibly 
affect or alter PSA, any advantage of the relugolix group over the leuprolide group for the key 
secondary PSA endpoint can be excluded. Plus, the results of the sensitivity analyses should provide 
reassurance regarding all prior and concomitant medical therapies that could alter testosterone or PSA 
levels. Regarding prior and concomitant radiation therapy, this does not affect testosterone levels, and 
therefore, is not expected to impact the primary endpoint. Moreover, the influence on the key 
secondary PSA endpoint of the three patients in the relugolix group who started radiotherapy to the 
prostate bed less than 2 months after study initiation is considered minimal. 
Primary endpoint - sustained castration rate. 
Assessment report  
EMA/218094/2022  
Page 117/176 
 
 
 
 
Primary analysis. The study successfully met its primary endpoint of sustained castration rate based on 
both evaluation criteria. Treatment with relugolix thus resulted in sustained testosterone suppression 
below castrate levels (< 50 ng/dL) and treatment with relugolix was non-inferior to treatment with 
leuprolide. According to the Applicant, the between-group difference demonstrated not only non-
inferiority of relugolix to leuprolide, but also statistical superiority, as the lower bound of the 95% CI 
was > 0, with p < 0.0001). This interpretation is not supported. Whereas it is considered that non-
inferiority of relugolix to leuprolide has, indeed, been demonstrated, superiority of relugolix over 
leuprolide has not. If superiority was to be claimed, it should have been included in the testing 
hierarchy. In the current testing strategy, the type 1 error is propagated to the next secondary 
endpoint, if it is also propagated to a superiority test on sustained castration rate of relugolix 
compared to leuprolide, the overall type 1 error rate is no longer protected. 
It should be noted that the observed sustained castration rate of 88.8% in the leuprolide group is 
substantially lower than the protocol assumption of 96% (used for sample size determination). This 
96% assumed sustained castration rate for leuprolide stems from the phase 3 degarelix registration 
study, which showed a 96.4% (95% CI: 92.5, 98.2) probability of sustained castration for the 
leuprolide group (from Day 28 to Day 364; Firmagon MAA EPAR). In contrast, the observed sustained 
castration rate of 96.7% for the relugolix group is in line with the protocol assumption of 94%. In the 
absence of another reasonable explanation for a different comparator response rate, the difference in 
leuprolide formulation between the two studies, i.e. leuprolide 3-month depot injections vs. monthly 
Lupron® (leuprolide) 7.5 mg, respectively might be considered as a potential factor of the discrepancy. 
This uncertainty on the response level of the leuprolide arm in study MVT-601-3201, possibly related 
to the formulation, should be carefully considered in the interpretation of the efficacy results. 
Sensitivity analyses. Sensitivity Analyses 1 and 2 provided reassurance that the IPDs and patients 
receiving concomitant medications and herbal supplements that could possibly affect testosterone did 
not have a significant impact on the results of the primary endpoint. It is noted that although 
Sensitivity Analysis 3 did meet Evaluation Criterion 2 (non-inferiority to leuprolide), the lower bound of 
the 95% CI for the relugolix group was less than 90% and Evaluation Criterion 1 was thus not met. 
This is acceptable, as Sensitivity Analysis 3 (counting patients who had missed two or more 
consecutive visits after Week 5 Day 1 or discontinued from the study early as having an event) is 
considered a rather conservative analysis. Sensitivity Analysis 4 corrected for (censored) patients who 
had not reached castrate levels of testosterone at Week 5 Day 1 (17 in leuprolide and four in 
relugolix). The results of this sensitivity analysis were consistent with the results from the primary 
analysis, providing reassurance that the results of the primary endpoint were not impacted by the 
somewhat delayed effect of leuprolide on testosterone suppression in some patients. 
In conclusion, the results of the sensitivity analyses are considered to support the robustness of the 
primary efficacy analysis. Results from three of the four sensitivity analyses were consistent with the 
primary analysis of the primary endpoint in terms of the lower bound of the 95% CI for sustained 
castration rate exceeding the 90% threshold in the relugolix group (Evaluation Criterion 1). Per the 
rather conservative Sensitivity Analysis 3, the results were generally consistent with the primary 
analysis but did not meet Evaluation Criterion 1. All four sensitivity analyses demonstrated 
non-inferiority of relugolix compared with leuprolide (Evaluation Criterion 2). 
Subgroup analyses. In virtually all subgroups, the result confirmed the results of the primary analysis 
of the primary endpoint, both for Evaluation Criterion 1 and 2. These subgroup analyses are thus 
considered to support the robustness of the primary efficacy analysis. Regarding the subgroup analysis 
of the different leuprolide dose levels, it is noted that the large majority of patients in the leuprolide 
group received leuprolide at the 25 mg dose level, i.e. 86% (264/308) of patients vs 14% (44/308) of 
patients who received leuprolide at the 11.25 mg dose level. All 44 patients who received leuprolide at 
the 11.25 mg dose level were from Japan, Taiwan, and China. It is also noted that the lower leuprolide 
Assessment report  
EMA/218094/2022  
Page 118/176 
 
 
 
 
dose level in these patients does not seem to negatively impact efficacy, i.e. does not result in a lower 
cumulative probability of sustained castration. This is considered reassuring for the comparison of the 
relugolix group with the whole leuprolide group. 
Secondary endpoints. Except for time to testosterone recovery, all key secondary endpoints tested 
at the primary analysis in hierarchical order (see Table 10) demonstrated superiority over leuprolide in 
a statistically significant manner. Treatment with relugolix thus: a) achieved testosterone suppression 
rapidly, more rapidly than treatment with leuprolide; b) resulted in a PSA response more rapidly than 
treatment with leuprolide; c) achieved profound testosterone suppression (< 20 ng/dL) more rapidly 
than treatment with leuprolide; and d) resulted in a greater degree of FSH suppression (at Week 25 
Day 1) than treatment with leuprolide. 
At the final analysis, treatment with relugolix did not result in an improvement of castration resistance 
free survival (during the 48-week treatment) over treatment with leuprolide in patients with metastatic 
prostate cancer (mITT Metastatic Patient Population). As a result, the subsequent key secondary 
endpoints in the hierarchical testing order (including time to testosterone recovery) were not formally 
tested/were merely analysed as exploratory. 
Still, the cumulative incidence rate of testosterone recovery to > 280 ng/dL at 90 days after drug 
discontinuation was numerically higher in the relugolix group compared with the leuprolide group and 
there was thus a trend for a shorter time to/faster testosterone recovery after study drug 
discontinuation for the relugolix group compared with the leuprolide group. 
For brevity, the results of the other (non-key) secondary endpoints, that were not part of the 
hierarchical testing order, and of the exploratory endpoint overall survival are not discussed as these 
are considered to have little impact on/to be of little value for the benefit-risk assessment. Only the 
following two remarks are made. 
Regarding patient-reported outcomes/quality of life, a numerically lower score for the EORTCQLQPR25 
hormonal treatment-related symptoms domain was observed at the 90-day follow up visit. The value 
of this isolated finding is considered uncertain, but could have a relation with the observed trend for a 
shorter time to/faster testosterone recovery after study drug discontinuation for the relugolix group 
compared with the leuprolide group. 
Regarding overall survival, there were few deaths during study MVT-601-3201 and follow-up (after the 
study and before database lock) and the vast majority of these were due to a treatment-emergent AE. 
Special populations. The number of patients in the pivotal study aged ≤ 75 or > 75 years old is 
shown in

Supportive studies. 
Study C27703. The patient population enrolled in this study C27003 is different from the patient 
population of the pivotal phase 3 study MVT-601-3201. Whereas the pivotal study enrolled patients 
with advanced prostate cancer who were mostly treated without curative intent/in a palliative setting, 
almost all patients in study C27003 were receiving radiotherapy with neoadjuvant/adjuvant ADT as the 
primary (first-line) therapy for their prostate and all were treated with curative intent. This is, 
however, not considered to have any impact on (the results of) the primary endpoint in both studies. 
Importantly, study treatment was in line with current European clinical guidelines, as among the 
treatment recommendations for patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer (who are suitable for 
ADT) there in is combined intensity modulated radiotherapy with short term ADT (4 to 6 months; 2021 
EAU Guidelines on prostate cancer). 
It is noted that relugolix dosing in study C27003 was slightly different from the pivotal phase 3 study 
MVT-601-3201. 
Study C27003 met its primary endpoint of rate of sustained castration, but it is noted that formal 
statistical testing was not conducted. The (thus also) merely descriptive results of the secondary 
endpoints testosterone and PSA kinetics are in line with what could be expected when comparing an 
oral formulation of a GnRH receptor antagonist with an injectable 1-month depot formulation, based on 
their identical mechanism of action but differing pharmacokinetics. 
In conclusion, notwithstanding the slightly different relugolix dosing used in study C27003 and the fact 
that formal statistical testing was not conducted, the results from this study can be considered to 
provide some support for the activity of relugolix in lowering testosterone to castration levels in a 
sustainable manner, in patients with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (in this study being patients 
with localized intermediate-risk disease). 
Study C27702. The patient population enrolled in study C27002 is similar to the patient population of 
the pivotal phase 3 study MVT-601-3201. Also, in study C27002 patients with advanced localized 
disease not suitable for primary therapy could be enrolled, besides patients with evidence of 
biochemical or clinical relapse following treatment with curative intent and patients with newly 
diagnosed metastatic disease. The remarks made above regarding this subgroup “3)” in the main study 
also apply here. 
It is noted that relugolix dosing in study C27002 was different from in the pivotal phase 3 study MVT-
601-3201. 
It is also noted that study C27002 did not meet its primary endpoint of rate of sustained castration, 
since the lower bounds of the 95% CIs for both relugolix doses were not > 90%. The Applicant argues 
that this outcome is likely driven by the small sample size affecting the statistical power for this 
assessment. It is uncertain whether this is truly the case, but this will not be further discussed or 
pursued, also as formal statistical testing was not conducted. The (thus also) merely descriptive results 
of the secondary endpoints testosterone and PSA kinetics are in line with what could be expected when 
comparing an GnRH receptor antagonists with a receptor agonists, based on their respective 
mechanism of action. 
In conclusion, notwithstanding the different relugolix dosing used in study C27002 and the fact that 
the study did not meet its primary objective of sustained castration, the results from this dose-finding

study can be considered to provide some support for the activity of relugolix in lowering testosterone 
to castration levels in a sustainable manner, in patients with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. 
Study TB-AK160108. Naturally, the support from this small phase 1 dose range-finding study for the 
efficacy of relugolix is limited. Plus, it is noted that (unsurprisingly) relugolix dosing in study TB-
AK160108 was different from in the pivotal phase 3 study MVT-601-3201. Nevertheless, the results 
from the dose range-finding study TB-AK160108 can also be considered to provide some support for 
the activity of relugolix in lowering testosterone to castration levels in a sustainable manner, in 
patients with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. 
Originally, the Applicant proposed an indication for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. It is, 
however, noted that only patients with androgen-sensitive advanced prostate cancer were enrolled in 
study MVT-601-3201, and this should be adequately reflected in the indication. Moreover, the 
proposed indication is very similar to the approved indication of the GnRH antagonist Firmagon 
(degarelix), i.e.- “FIRMAGON is a gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist indicated for 
treatment of adult male patients with advanced hormone-dependent prostate cancer.” (see 
Firmagon SmPC). It is, however, important to note that the CHMP for this wording of the Firmagon 
indication took into account that in the pivotal study for Firmagon, non-inferiority to leuprolide control 
had been investigated using biological criteria only and not clinical endpoints indicative of a direct 
benefit (see Firmagon MAA EPAR). The same is true for the pivotal relugolix study MVT-601-3201, as 
the primary endpoint and all secondary endpoints that were tested statistically are of 
pharmacodynamic nature or concern a biomarker, and are not clinical measures of patient benefit per 
se (see above). All in all, it is considered that the wording of the Orgovyx (relugolix) indication should 
also include the words “advanced hormone--sensitive prostate cancer”, in line with other, more 
recent approvals in this disease setting (see Xtandi SmPC, Erleada SmPC, and Zytiga SmPC). 
Plus, in 2019 the EMA developed a paper to strengthen consistency when defining (the wording of) 
therapeutic indications in the product information of medicines (EMA/CHMP/483022/2019). Based on 
this guidance, the Applicant removed the pharmacotherapeutic class (“is a gonadotropin-releasing 
hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist”) from the wording. In light of this guidance, it could also be 
considered to request the Applicant to add “as monotherapy” to the indication, since relugolix was 
investigated in the pivotal study as such. However, for patients with newly diagnosed, metastatic 
hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, i.e. one of the three ‘advanced prostate cancer’ patient subgroups 
in the pivotal study, ADT monotherapy is no longer considered standard of care. Current clinical 
guidelines recommend a combination of ADT with docetaxel, abiraterone, enzalutamide, or 
apalutamide (or radiotherapy; 2021 EAU Guidelines on prostate cancer; 2020 ESMO Prostate cancer 
guidelines). An approval with a restrictive monotherapy indication would severely limit/hamper the use 
of relugolix for treating these patients in clinical practice with such combination therapy. Of note, some 
patients in the pivotal study did receive combination treatment of relugolix with docetaxel (n=8) or 
enzalutamide (n=17), for some time during the study. Refer to Baseline data - Prior and 
concomitant medical therapies that could alter testosterone or PSA levels. It is, however, 
uncertain whether the concomitant use of relugolix and docetaxel, abiraterone, enzalutamide, or 
apalutamide will have any relevant (detrimental) effect on relugolix efficacy and/or safety. For 
reassurance, the Applicant provided PK and PD data/results for 20 patients in study MVT-601-3201 
who received combination treatment with enzalutamide and relugolix. No clinical meaningful 
differences in the PK of relugolix or in testosterone suppression were observed in these 20 patients, 
see section Pharmacokinetics. In addition, the Applicant referred to the ongoing phase 1 safety and 
tolerability study MVT-601-049 investigating the combination of relugolix with either abiraterone, 
apalutamide, or docetaxel with respect to PK and PD (NCT04666129). The Applicant is recommended 
to submit the final CSR as a post-authorisation measure (PAM) in 4Q of 2023 (see also section 
Discussion on clinical pharmacology).

2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In the pivotal study MVT-601-3201 patients with androgen sensitive advanced prostate cancer were 
randomized to treatment with either the oral GnRH antagonist relugolix or standard-of-care depot 
injections of the GnRH agonist leuprolide. The study met its primary endpoint, as treatment with 
relugolix resulted in a sustained castration rate of ≥ 90%, i.e. a testosterone level < 50 ng/dL from 
Day 29 through 337 (Evaluation Criterion 1), plus treatment with relugolix was noninferior to 
treatment with leuprolide as assessed by sustained testosterone suppression rate (Evaluation Criterion 
2). The results of the sensitivity and subgroup analyses are considered to support the robustness of 
the primary efficacy analysis of the primary endpoint. All key secondary endpoints tested hierarchically 
at the primary analysis, except for (time to) testosterone recovery, demonstrated superiority over or 
at least confirmed noninferiority to leuprolide. Although both primary and all key secondary endpoints 
that were tested statistically are of pharmacodynamic nature or concern a biomarker, achievement of 
castrate levels of testosterone is an acceptable primary efficacy endpoint in patients with hormone 
sensitive advanced prostate cancer and is considered to meet the CHMP regulatory requirements. 
The initially applied indication was amended to reflect the pivotal study population, i.e. only patients 
with androgen-sensitive advanced prostate cancer, and be aligned with relevant precedents (Firmagon, 
Xtandi, Erleada, and Zytiga). Further, the data/results from study MVT-601-3201 are not considered 
sufficient proof of patient benefit beyond the hormone-sensitive prostate cancer setting. Plus, any 
indication beyond the hormone-sensitive prostate cancer setting would not be in line with EMA 
guidance and regulatory precedents. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
Main safety information for oral relugolix 120 mg once daily following a single dose of 360 mg loading 
dose in the treatment of patients with advanced prostate cancer is based on the pivotal phase 3 study 
MVT-601-3201. The GnRH agonist leuprolide was used as active control in this study. Leuprolide was 
given as a 3-month depot injection, every 12 weeks for 48 weeks (last injection occurred 12 weeks 
prior to the end of the treatment period). 
Results of safety analyses from the final analysis population, including the safety analyses for the 
subgroup of patients with metastatic disease, are considered supportive data.  
In addition, supportive safety data is derived from three other studies in prostate cancer:  
• 
• 
• 
C27002: phase 2 study of relugolix in patients with advanced prostate cancer (similar 
population to that for MVT-601-3201); controlled by the GnRH agonist leuprolide 
C27003: phase 2 study of relugolix as neoadjuvant/adjuvant to external beam radiotherapy in 
localized prostate cancer patients; controlled by the GnRH antagonist degarelix 
TB-AK160108: phase 1 dose-range-finding study of relugolix in prostate cancer patients 
eligible for ADT. 
Additional safety data were collected from 13 clinical pharmacology studies in healthy participants and 
participants with hepatic or renal failure.  
Further, clinical studies with relugolix monotherapy 40 mg in women with uterine fibroids or 
endometriosis are included. Given the lower dose used, the different indication, and different 
demographics, use of data is limited to the evaluation of adverse events of clinical interest (alanine

aminotransferase [ALT] or aspartate aminotransferase [AST] ≥ 3 × the upper limit of normal [ULN]), 
as drug-induced liver injury is often idiopathic and dose independent. 
These studies provide safety data on 2495 patients exposed to relugolix (935 patients with prostate 
cancer, 1004 women with uterine fibroids or endometriosis, and 556 participants in clinical 
pharmacology studies). 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
Prostate Cancer Indication 
The pivotal phase 3 study MVT-601-3201 is considered the primary analysis population for evaluation 
of the safety of relugolix 120 mg once daily in advanced prostate cancer patients. There were two 
analyses for this study: a primary analysis and a final analysis.  
• 
• 
The primary analysis of safety occurred after 934 patients were randomized to the study 
(Cohort 1) and completed the 48-week treatment period and 30-day safety follow-up visit or 
discontinued early.  
The final analysis of the study occurred after 434 patients with metastatic disease (of whom 
295 patients were also included in the primary analysis [Cohort 1]) were randomized to the 
study (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2) and completed the 48-week treatment period and 30-day safety 
follow-up visit or discontinued early. The study remains ongoing. To support registration in 
China, additional patients are being enrolled in the study from China and Taiwan (under 
Protocol Amendment 3). In total there were 18 patients with metastatic disease from either 
China (7 patients) or Taiwan (11 patients) included in the final analysis as they were 
randomized prior to the completion of the enrollment of patients supporting the final analysis 
(ie, enrolled by 31 Jul 2019).

Note: Concomitant treatments allowed to counteract adverse effects of androgen-deprivation  
Concomitant treatments were allowed to prevent disease exacerbation due to flare-up in the 
leuprorelin treatment arm. Patients were permitted to take antiandrogen therapies including, but not 
limited to, bicalutamide during the study for the prevention of the initial flare response in the 
leuprolide group for the first 4 weeks or longer. Antiandrogen therapies including, but not limited to, 
enzalutamide were also allowed in both groups after the confirmation of PSA progression as defined by 
the PCWG3 criteria (Scher et al. 2016) or other disease progression in the setting of testosterone 
suppression to castrate levels. Antiandrogen therapies were otherwise prohibited on study. 
The use of concomitant bone-modifying agents to prevent BMD loss during clinical studies was at the 
discretion of the treating investigator. 
Supportive Women’s Health Studies 
In the Women’s Health 12-Week Monotherapy Safety Population, 1311 female patients were exposed 
to at least one dose of relugolix (ranging from 10 to 40 mg) from eight pooled studies of women with 
uterine fibroids or endometriosis. 
Clinical Pharmacology Studies 
A total of 556 healthy adult men and women (or patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment or 
moderate or severe renal impairment) received at least one dose of relugolix as single doses ranging

The overall incidence of AEs in the primary analysis of study MVT-601-3201 was similar for the two 
treatment groups. No obvious difference in the incidence of AEs between relugolix and leuprorelin was 
found, except for withdrawal due to the different route of administration (relugolix via daily oral tablet 
versus leuprolide by 3-month depot subcutaneous injection).

AEs were generally reported with similar incidence between the two treatment groups with exception 
events associated with MACE, and adverse events of constipation, diarrhoea, arthralgia, and 
hypertension. Observed differences were usually small, and did not follow a trend or pattern. 
The most commonly reported (> 10% patients) AEs in any treatment group included hot flush, fatigue, 
constipation, diarrhoea, arthralgia, and hypertension.  
All constipation and diarrhoea AEs were mild or moderate (grade 1 or grade 2) in severity. There were 
no serious adverse events (SAEs) of constipation or diarrhoea. One patient in the relugolix group was 
withdrawn from the study due to a nonserious grade 2 AE of constipation. Most arthralgia AEs were 
mild or moderate (grade 1 or grade 2) in severity, and none were serious or led to study drug 
interruption or withdrawal. 
Constipation, diarrhoea, and musculoskeletal pain (which includes arthralgia) are included in Section 
4.8 of the proposed SmPC for relugolix as ‘very common’ adverse drug reactions ADRs).

Cataracts were observed and reported as AEs in both relugolix groups compared to no patients in the 
leuprolide group. This is attributed to enhanced surveillance as the protocol-specified use of slit lamp 
examinations in the relugolix groups only. Slit lamp examinations (visual acuity) were conducted as 
part of monitoring for phospholipidosis (PLD). The median age of the patients was 73 years. The 
observed incidence is generally consistent with the epidemiology of cataract development.

The overall incidence of grade 3 or higher AEs was lower in the relugolix group compared to the 
degarelix group (2% vs. 11%). The two grade 3 or higher events (headache and hypertension) were 
reported for the same patient in the relugolix group and these events were reported as serious AEs, 
assessed as not related to study drug by the investigator, and did not lead to treatment 
discontinuation.

Study TB-AK160108 
In Part A, 1 of 3 patients in Cohort 1 (relugolix 80 mg) had a grade 3 or higher AE of hypertension, 
which was not considered to be drug-related and, therefore, not a dose limiting toxicity. No other 
grade 3 or higher AEs were reported in Part A. 
In Part B, 10 patients (5/15 patients in each treatment group) were reported to have a grade 3 or 
higher AE. An AE of grade 3 or higher hypertension was reported for 2/15 patients in the relugolix 80-
mg group and an additional patient was reported to have blood pressure increased, for a combined 
total of three patients in the relugolix 80-mg group for this complex of related terms; all other grade 
3 or higher AE in either relugolix group were reported for one patient each.

A total of 123 patients had a SAE. The incidence of SAEs was lower for the relugolix group (12.2%; 76 
patients) compared with the leuprolide group (15.3%; 47 patients). 
Drug-relationship: Drug-related SAEs were reported in both groups (six patients [1.0%] in the 
relugolix group and three patients [1.0%] in the leuprolide group). The preferred terms reported for 
the six patients in the relugolix group were gastric ulcer haemorrhage, acute myocardial infarction, hip 
fracture, acute left ventricular failure and aortic stenosis (both in a single patient), acute coronary 
syndrome and cellulitis (both in a single patient), and cardiac failure congestive and chronic kidney

disease (both in a single patient). The preferred terms reported for the three patients in the leuprolide 
group with drug-related SAEs were cardiac failure, sinus node dysfunction, and hyperglycaemia and 
transient ischemic attack (both in a single patient). No drug-related SAE was reported for more than 
one patient.  
Severity: Eighty-one patients (8.7%) had a SAE that was a grade 3 maximum severity, with 
proportions similar between the two groups (8.0% in the relugolix group and 10.1% in the leuprolide 
group).  
Six patients (1.0%) in the relugolix group had a grade 4 SAE: endocarditis and septic shock (both in a 
single patient), acute myocardial infarction, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, suicidal ideation, 
and chronic kidney disease. Two patients (0.6%) in the leuprolide group had a grade 4 SAE: liver 
function test abnormal in one patient, pulmonary oedema and rhabdomyolysis in another patient. 
C27002 
SAEs were reported in 6 patients (10.7%) in the relugolix 80-mg group, 2 patients (3.7%) in the 
relugolix 120-mg group, and 2 patients (8.3%) in the leuprorelin group. No SAE was reported in more 
than 1 patient in any group. One SAE, embolic stroke in a patient in the relugolix 120-mg group, was 
assessed by the reporter to be drug-related. 
C27003 
In study C27003, SAEs were reported for a lower proportion of patients in the relugolix group 
compared with the degarelix group (2% [one patient; headache and hypertension] vs. 8% [three 
patients; esophagitis ulcerative, road traffic accident and mesothelioma malignant with pleural 
effusion], respectively). 
TB-AK160108 
No SAEs were reported for patients in Part A. In Part B, 6 patients (3/15 patients in each dose group) 
had one or more SAEs, All SAEs were reported in only one patient in either dose group. The SAE of 
cerebral infarction was considered drug-related and led to study drug discontinuation and the outcome 
of the SAE was reported as recovering/resolving at the end of the study. 
Deaths 
Sixteen deaths were reported in study MVT-601-3201 at the time of the primary analysis (7 ([1.1%] in 
the relugolix group and 9 [2.9%] in the leuprolide group) and five deaths (4 relugolix, 1 leuprolide) 
were reported in study C27002. Subsequently, at the time of the MVT-601-3201 final analysis, deaths 
had been reported in 10 patients (1.4%) in the relugolix group and 11 patients (3.1%) in the 
leuprolide group. In the final analysis of study MVT-601-3201, five additional patients (three relugolix, 
two leuprolide) died (relugolix group acute respiratory failure, death [suspect metastatic prostate 
cancer], and myocardial infarction; leuprolide group: COVID-19 pneumonia and prostate cancer). 
All cases were assessed by the investigator as not related to study drug, with the exception of one 
fatal case that was considered possibly related: a 74-year old patient on relugolix for 138 days had a 
fatal acute myocardial infarction. 
The 27 deaths reported during the safety reporting period of studies MVT-601-3201 and C27002, and 
also the death for one patient who died after the adverse event reporting period are listed in

Adverse events of special interest 
Safety parameters of clinical interest represent prespecified categories of adverse events that are 
either: 
•  known toxicities of ADT with GnRH receptor agonists: 
o 
carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects,  
o  adverse cardiovascular events,  
o 
loss of bone mineral density,  
o  QTc prolongation,  
o  mood disorders,  
o  and vasomotor symptoms  
•  potential risks associated with relugolix based on nonclinical data  
o  hepatic transaminase elevations  
• 
theoretical risks with an investigational agent 
o  hypersensitivity  
An overall summary of AEs in these categories is presented in Table 43 for the Primary Analysis Safety 
Population of the Pivotal Phase 3 Study MVT-601-3201.

Vasomotor symptoms 
Vasomotor symptoms (mainly hot flush, but also hyperhidrosis, feeling hot, night sweats, and flushing) 
are known AEs of androgen deprivation therapy with GnRH receptor agonists. As can be expected, all 
studies showed vasomotor symptoms in approximately 50-60% of patients and incidence was 
comparable between relugolix and leuprolide, and relugolix and degarelix.

AEs related to abnormal glucose metabolism were reported in both relugolix (5.8%) and leuprolide 
(6.2%) groups in the pivotal phase 3 study. ‘Diabetes mellitus’ was reported with a higher incidence on 
relugolix (3.7%) compared to leuprolide (1.9%); however, for ‘ type 2 diabetes mellitus’ this was lower 
with relugolix compared to leuprolide (0.5% and 1.9%, respectively). Most events of diabetes mellitus 
were exacerbations of existing diabetes. In time, mean glucose concentrations increased with an 
overall mean increase at Week 49 of 0.39 mmol/L on relugolix and 0.51 mmol/L on leuprolide.  
As also for the final analysis and the other prostate cancer studies, there was no trends in AE terms 
relating to glucose metabolism: 
C27002 
Shifts in glucose levels from baseline grade 0 to grade 2 occurred for 21% of patients in the relugolix 
80-mg group and 23% of patients in the relugolix 120-mg group, compared with 9% of patients in the 
leuprorelin group. However, no differences in HbA1c were observed.

In study C27003, there were no clear imbalances in AE terms relating to glucose metabolism. Shifts in 
glucose levels from baseline grade 0 to grade 2 occurred for two patients (3%) in the relugolix group 
and one patient (3%) in the degarelix group, and one patient in the relugolix group (2%) had a shift 
from baseline grade 0 to grade 3. Overall changes in median and mean values of HbA1c were minor, 
with median increases from 0.1% to 0.3%. There were some upward shifts of HbA1c in diabetic 
patients who had elevated HbA1c at baseline.

TB-AK160108 
There were no clear trends in AE terms relating to glucose metabolism during study TB-AK160108. In 
Part B, 2/15 patients in the relugolix 120 mg group were reported to have AEs of diabetes mellitus and 
both events were considered drug related. Neither patient had an event assessed as grade 3 or higher, 
serious, or resulting in study drug discontinuation. No clinically significant changes from baseline were 
noted in HbA1c levels over the course of the study in either the relugolix 80 mg or 120 mg group.

In the pivotal phase 3 study, AEs related to abnormal lipid metabolism were similar in both groups 
(3.1% in the relugolix group and 2.3% in the leuprolide group). Individual events (including blood 
cholesterol increased, blood triglycerides increased, hypertriglyceridemia, dyslipidaemia, 
hypercholesterolemia, and hyperlipidaemia) did not occur >1%, except hypertriglyceridaemia in the 
leuprolide group (1.6%). Results in the final analysis were comparable to results reported for the 
Primary Analysis. No obvious differences in lipid metabolism were observed between groups over 48 
weeks of treatment. 
C27002 
In study C27002 there were no clear imbalances in AE terms relating to lipid metabolism. Mean values 
of lipids were generally stable over time with only slight increases in LDL cholesterol without 
differences between treatment groups. 
C27003 
In study C27003 there were no clear imbalances in AE terms relating to lipid metabolism. Mean values 
of lipids were generally stable over time with only slight increases in LDL cholesterol without 
differences between treatment groups.

TB-AK160108 
In study TB-AK160108 there were no clear trends in AEs relating lipid metabolism. No clinically 
significant changes from baseline were noted in serum lipid levels over the course of the study in either 
the relugolix 80 mg or 120 mg group. 
Hepatic Transaminase Elevations 
In the primary analysis of study MVT-601-3201, there were 13 patients with an AE of clinical interest 
(ALT and/or AST ≥ 3× ULN) reported during the study: 9 (1.4%) on relugolix and 4 (1.3%) on 
leuprolide. The proportion of patients with laboratory values meeting predefined limits of change at any 
time for ALT or AST were similar in both treatment groups. One SAE of grade 4 liver function test 
abnormal was reported for a patient with widely metastatic disease in the leuprolide group; no action 
was taken with study drug leuprolide (this is also not possible as this is a 3-month depot formulation). 
One patient on relugolix discontinued study drug due to alanine aminotransferase increased.  
General liver safety AEs were searched for using the Drug-Related Hepatic Disorders SMQ (narrow); 
the resulting AEs are summarized by preferred term for the Primary Analysis Safety Population in

Clinical laboratory biochemistry 
The overall trends of AST and ALT per visit over time in both relugolix and leuprolide groups were 
similar.  
AEs of clinical interest (ALT and/or AST ≥ 3 × ULN) were reported for nine patients (1.4%) in the 
relugolix group and for four patients (1.3%) in the leuprolide group.  Ten patients (six in the relugolix 
group; four in the leuprolide group) had ALT ≥ 3 × ULN as shown in the elevation of drug-induced 
serious hepatotoxicity plot in the dossier. 
Supportive prostate cancer studies 
In study C27002, hepatic transaminase elevation-related AEs were reported in 11 of 110 patients 
(10%) in the relugolix groups (7 patients [12.5%] in the 80-mg group and 4 patients [7.4%] in the 
120-mg group) and 4 of 24 patients (16.7%) in the leuprorelin group. There were two nonserious 
events of grade 3 or higher ALT and AST increase, reported in 1 patient in the relugolix 80-mg group. 
These events did not lead to study drug discontinuation.

Page 143/176 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In study C27003, no hepatic AEs were reported in the relugolix group. In the degarelix group, 
5 patients (13%) were reported to have AEs of ALT increased and 2 patients (5%) were reported to 
have AEs of AST increased. This imbalance is reflected in the laboratory shift analysis of AST, where 
shifts in AST from grade 0 to 1 were observed in fewer patients in the relugolix group (3%) than in the 
degarelix group (16%). There were no events of hepatic transaminase elevation that were grade 3 or 
higher, serious or led to study drug discontinuation in either group. 
In Part A of the study, 1/3 patients in Cohort 1 had an event of an ALT increased, and 1/4 patients in 
Cohort 3 had an event of hepatic function abnormal. Neither event was serious and neither led to study 
drug discontinuation. 
In Part B, adverse events relevant to hepatic function in 2 or more patients were reported as follows: 
aspartate aminotransferase increased (4/30 patients), alanine aminotransferase increased (3/30 
patients), hepatic function abnormal (3/30 patients), and liver function test increased (2/30 patients). 
These events were reported for a higher proportion of patients in the relugolix 120 mg group than in 
the 80 mg group, except for hepatic function abnormal. None of these events were serious or led to 
discontinuation of study drug. 
Clinical Pharmacology Studies in Healthy Participants 
In clinical pharmacology studies, 5 of the 556 participants were reported to have transient and 
reversible hepatic transaminase elevations that met the criterion of an adverse event of clinical interest 
(≥ 3 × ULN).  
Women’s Health 12-Week Monotherapy Safety Population 
In the Women’s Health 12-Week Monotherapy Safety Population, ten AEs of clinical interest were 
reported. Of these, 7 events (6 in women treated with relugolix [6/1311; 0.2%], 1 in a woman treated 
with leuprolide [1/223; 0.5%]) were events of ALT ≥ 3 × ULN (data on file). One SAE of liver function 
test abnormal was reported in a patient with endometriosis from the phase 2 study TAK-385/CCT-001. 
No events were associated with increased bilirubin. All events resolved. 
Hypersensitivity 
In the primary analysis of study MVT-601-3201, incidence of AEs related to hypersensitivity were 
reported for similar proportions of patients in both groups (44 patients [7.1%] in the relugolix group 
and 26 patients [8.4%] in the leuprolide group), with rash as the most common (3.2% and 2.3% of 
patients in each group, respectively).  
Hypersensitivity is a theoretical risk with a new investigational agent and is therefore investigated. 
There was no unbalance or trend in the AEs observed that appeared to point to relugolix or to a 
different pattern with regard to hypersensitivity compared to leuprolide or degarelix. 
Therefore, in the proposed prescribing information for relugolix only the standard contraindication has 
been included (‘Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients) listed in 
section 6.1’). However, it is proposed to add ‘rash’ in the ADR table of section 4.8. 
Mood disorders 
In the primary analysis of study MVT-601-3201, incidence of AEs related to mood disorders were 
similar between relugolix and leuprolide (5.1% in the relugolix group and 4.5% in the leuprolide 
group), consisting of a heterogenous group varying from mood swings to insomnia, but with 
Assessment report  
EMA/218094/2022  
Page 144/176 
 
 
 
 
depression as the most common (1.9% (n=12) and 1.0% (n=3) of patients in each group, 
respectively).  
Persistently low testosterone with GnRH agonists or antagonists is associated with change in mood 
disorders. There is no unbalance or trend in the AEs that appears to point to a different pattern with 
regard to mood disorders compared to leuprolide or degarelix. 
Depression is listed in the proposed prescribing information for relugolix (4.8), which is considered 
appropriate. It is also included in the SmPCs of degarelix (4.8) and leuprolide (4.4, 4.8).

When the incidence of MACE was adjusted for exposure to treatment, the difference between the 
relugolix and leuprolide groups remained: the exposure-adjusted event rate for an adverse event 
associated with MACE was 3.3 in the relugolix group and 7.0 in the leuprolide group. The cumulative 
incidence of MACE in all patients for the primary analysis of study MVT-601-3201 is shown in

The Kaplan-Meier curves for time to MACE separated within the first 4 weeks of the study and 
continued to separate through the safety-follow up visit. After 48 weeks of treatment, the estimates of 
MACE rate were for the relugolix group 2.84% (95% CI: 1.77%, 4.53%) compared with the leuprolide 
group at 5.62% (95% CI: 3.53%, 8.89%).  
Justification for unadjudicated MACE 
The MACE events used in above post-hoc analysis were not adjudicated; however, the reported events 
and patient narratives provided are largely consistent with those events recommended to be included 
by the 2017 Cardiovascular and Stroke Endpoint Definitions publication developed by the Standardized 
Data Collection for Cardiovascular Trials Initiative and FDA (Hicks et al. 2018). 
Events of MACE were collected according to standard practice for adverse event collection, underwent 
100% source data verification with study monitors at the study site to assess for any missing adverse 
event data, particularly serious adverse events. Furthermore, medical review of each individual patient 
profile was conducted prior to database lock to reconcile any new concomitant medication use with 
reported adverse events to ensure adverse events requiring medication were not missed. 
This analysis was performed as part of the assessment of safety and, therefore, was not a key 
endpoint in the study; no adjustments were made for multiplicity of testing. However, the magnitude 
of the differences observed and the rigor and completeness of adverse event collection in this study 
Assessment report  
EMA/218094/2022  
Page 149/176 
 
 
 
 
 
mitigate the likelihood of these differences occurring by chance in this large randomized prospective 
trial in a population of patients with comparable cardiovascular history and risk factors at baseline.  
Finally, the study used the SMQ for MACE as agreed with the FDA prior to database lock.  
Ischemic heart disease 
A medical history of ischemic heart disease, identified by applying the Ischemic Heart Disease SMQ to 
medical history data, was reported similarly between the treatment groups (12.2% of patients in the 
relugolix group vs. 14.6% of patients in the leuprolide group). In a post hoc analysis, generally similar 
proportions of patients without a medical history of ischemic heart disease in both groups reported 
adverse events associated with ischemic heart disease (1.8% and 1.1%, respectively), see

After 48 weeks of treatment, the Kaplan-Meier estimates of ischemic heart disease rate in all patients 
was 2.20% (95% CI: 1.28%, 3.76%) in the relugolix group and 1.67% (95% CI: 0.70%, 3.96%) in 
the leuprolide group (hazard ratio = 1.4813; 95% CI: 0.5384, 4.0755). 
Loss of Bone Mineral Density 
Bone mineral density loss is associated with testosterone deficiency in men, based on the mechanism 
of action for both GnRH agonists and antagonists, where hormone levels are decrease to castrate-
levels for a longer period of time.  
In the relugolix development program, early studies included the use of dual-energy x-ray 
absorptiometry (DXA) scans to assess bone density. Monitoring in subsequent studies included 
reporting of all fractures as adverse events. The use of concomitant bone-modifying agents such as 
denosumab or a bisphosphonate could also be recommended for some patients to decrease risk of 
pathologic fractures and other skeletal events during clinical studies which was at the discretion of the 
treating investigator.  
Bone mineral density with bone densitometry was not assessed in the pivotal study MVT-601-3201 as 
the 48-week treatment duration was not expected to result in clinically relevant bone mineral density 
loss in this patient population treated for advanced prostate cancer. In the primary analysis of study 
MVT-601-3201, bone health events were reported for similar proportions of patients in both the 
relugolix group (20 patients [3.2%]) and the leuprolide group (12 patients [3.9%]). The proportion of 
patients with fracture-related AEs was also similar between the two groups (1.4 and 1.0%, 
respectively).  
The AEs reported in the Primary Analysis Safety Population are summarized by preferred term in

DXA 
In Study C27002, bone loss was monitored. Bone health-related events were reported in 8 patients 
(7.3%; osteopenia [3 patients], hand fracture [2 patients], osteoporosis, BMD decrease, cervical 
vertebral fracture [1 patient each]) in the relugolix group. The events in five of the 8 patients were 
assessed by the investigator as drug-related. In the leuprorelin group there were no bone health-
related adverse events reported. During the study, BMD was monitored by DXA at baseline and Week 
49 in both groups and, although there was some variation within each group there were no clinically 
important differences observed in percent change over time on T-score. For all treatment groups, N-
telopeptide was increased from baseline at both Week 13, Day 1 and Week 49, Day 1. Median percent 
changes from baseline at Week 49, Day 1 were approximately 32% and 43% in the relugolix 80-mg 
and 120-mg groups, respectively, and approximately 16% in the leuprorelin group. Median change 
measured by DXA was -2%, -1.6% in the relugolix 80-mg and 120-mg groups, respectively, and -
2.5% in the leuprorelin group. 
QTc prolongation 
In the pivotal study, AEs related to QTc prolongation were searched for using the Torsade de 
pointes/QT prolongation SMQ (broad). AEs potentially related to QTc prolongation were reported for a 
similar proportion of patients in both pooled relugolix and leuprolide groups (2.1% vs. 1.9%, 
respectively. The adverse events are summarized by preferred term for the Primary Analysis Safety

Electrocardiograms (12-lead) were obtained at the screening 3 visit, the baseline (Day 1), Week 5, 
Week 13, Week 25, Week 49/early termination visit, and the safety follow-up visit. A total of 36 
patients (27 patients [4.3%] in the relugolix group and 9 patients [2.9%] in the leuprolide group) had 
an ECG that was interpreted as abnormal and clinically significant. The study did not collect details of 
ECGs besides the investigator’s determination of clinical significance. In study C27002, ECGs were 
obtained throughout the study and interval data entered in the database. During the study, a change 
in QTcF was ≥ 30 msec for 9% to 21% of patients in the combined 80-mg and 120-mg relugolix 
groups, respectively, and leuprorelin results were similar. The incidence of a change from baseline ≥  
60 msec was ≤3% for the combined 80-mg and 120-mg relugolix group at any study visit; eight 
patients (7%; four patients per 80-mg dose level and four patients per 120-mg dose level) in the 
combined relugolix group had a maximum change from baseline ≥  60 msec at some time during the 
study. No patient in the leuprorelin group had a change from baseline of ≥ 60 msec. No patient in the 
study had an adverse event reported based on ECG results.  
In study C27003, the majority of patients had QTcF values below 450 msec throughout the study. A 
change from baseline in QTcF ≥ 30 msec was observed for approximately 10% of patients in the 
relugolix group for each study visit and between 8% to 24% of patients in the degarelix group for each 
study visit. One patient (2%) in the relugolix group and no patient in the degarelix group had a change 
from baseline QTcF ≥ 60 msec. 
Second primary malignancies 
In the pivotal study MVT-601-3201, a post hoc analysis was performed to evaluate the occurrence and 
type of second primary malignancies. This analysis is summarized by treatment group and 
cumulatively over time (0-12, 0-24, 0-36, and 0-48 weeks) in Table 54.

Second primary malignancies were reported more often in the relugolix group (19 patients [3.1%]) 
compared with the leuprolide group (three patients [1.0%]). There was no clear imbalance for a 
specific tumour type. In the relugolix group there was an even distribution over the 48-week period. 
In study C27002, two relugolix patients (1.8%) reported a second primary malignancy, including one 
patient with bladder cancer reported on Day 28 and one patient with basal cell carcinoma reported on 
Day 136 [both in the relugolix 80-mg group]). There were no reports of second primary malignancies 
in the leuprorelin group.  
In study C27003, three relugolix patients (4.6%) reported a second primary malignancy, all within the 
first 12 weeks of treatment (two patients with squamous cell carcinoma and one patient with basal cell 
carcinoma) compared with one patient (2.6%) in the degarelix group with malignant mesothelioma 
reported after 24 weeks of treatment.  
In study TB-AK10608, one event of oesophageal cancer was reported at week 85 in the open-label 
expansion phase of the study (ie, study Day 597). 
2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
Biochemistry 
In the MVT-601-3201 Primary Analysis Safety Population, mean chemistry laboratory values at 
baseline and subsequent time points were generally consistent across the treatment groups for all 
parameters. Furthermore, for chemistry laboratory parameter shifts from baseline, observed values 
were generally consistent across treatment groups with most values being in the normal range (ie, 
grade 0) for most parameters.  
Assessment report

Median creatinine levels at baseline were similar in the relugolix and leuprolide groups (83.0 µmol/L 
and 84.0 µmol/L, respectively) and remained similar at Week 49 Day 1 (Day 337) (81.0 µmol/L and 
80.0 µmol/L). A small and similar proportion of patients in both groups demonstrated a creatinine 
postbaseline value > 1.5 mg/dL and above baseline values (4.5% in in relugolix group and 4.9% in 
leuprolide group). Both groups had an even smaller proportion of patients with a greater than 50% 
increase in creatinine from baseline (1.6% and 1.0%, respectively). 
Results for ALT and AST and parameters related to glucose/lipid metabolism are summarized with 
adverse events of clinical interest. 
Haematology 
In the MVT-601-3201 Primary Analysis Safety Population, mean haematology laboratory values at 
baseline and subsequent time points were generally consistent across the treatment groups for all 
parameters. Furthermore, for haematology laboratory parameter shifts from baseline, observed values 
were generally consistent across treatment groups with most values being in the normal range (ie, 
grade 0) for most parameters.  
Median haemoglobin levels at baseline were within the normal range for both groups: 144.0 g/L in 
the relugolix group and 143.0 g/L in leuprolide group. The median haemoglobin levels at Week 49 Day 
1 (Day 337) decreased by approximately 10 g/L compared with baseline levels in both groups (median 
of 134.0 g/L in relugolix group and 133.5 g/L in leuprolide group). Most patients in relugolix and 
leuprolide groups had a decrease of > 1 g/dL from baseline in haemoglobin during the study (68.8% 
and 67.5%, respectively). 
The proportion of patients with haemoglobin ≤ 10.5 g/dL after baseline were similar in relugolix 
(4.8%) and leuprolide groups (5.5%). A small proportion of patients (0.5% in the relugolix group and 
0.6% in the leuprolide group) had grade 0, 1, or 2 anaemia at baseline and developed grade ≥ 3 
anaemia during the study. One patient (0.2%) in the relugolix group with normal platelet values at 
baseline had grade 4 decreased platelets postbaseline, compared with no patients in the leuprolide 
group. Two separate nonserious adverse events of grade 3 platelet count decreased were reported for 
both occurrences.  
Median platelet values at baseline were similar in the relugolix group (218.5.0 × 109/L) and the 
leuprolide group (214.0 × 109/L) and slightly increased at Week 49 Day 1 (Day 337) in both groups 
(226.0 × 109/L and 222.0 × 109/L, respectively). A smaller proportion of patients who received 
relugolix (2.7%) developed platelet levels less than the lower limit of normal during the study 
compared with patients who received leuprolide (5.8%). Patients who had platelet values < 100 × 
109/L during the study were comparable in both groups (0.5% in relugolix group and 0.6% in 
leuprolide group). 
Other prostate cancer studies 
In study C27003, mean haemoglobin levels declined over time for both the relugolix group and 
degarelix group. At baseline, mean haemoglobin was 14.5 g/dL in the relugolix group and 14.3 g/dL in 
the degarelix group. At Week 25 Day 1 (Day 169), mean haemoglobin in each group was 13.1 g/dL in 
the relugolix group and 12.9 g/dL in the degarelix group. Neutrophil counts decreased in both groups 
over time; 3% of patients in each group were reported to have a shift from grade 0 to grade 2 without 
associated discontinuation of study drug treatment. The maximum post baseline shift in platelet count 
was grade 1 (relugolix 14%, degarelix 21%). In the individual supportive studies, there were no clear 
imbalances or trends in changes of haematology parameters following treatment with relugolix.

For the relugolix group of the final analysis safety population, the overall distributions of adverse 
events for the age subgroups of < 65, ≥ 65 to < 75, ≥ 75 to < 85, and ≥ 85 years of age were similar 
except that the oldest subgroup (≥ 85 years) had the highest incidences of SAEs and of AEs leading to 
study drug discontinuation. Additionally, the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events was highest for 
the oldest (≥ 85 years) subgroup (7.4%) compared with other age subgroups (ranging from 2.9% to 
4.9%).  
The incidence of carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects and mood disorders was highest in the 
youngest (< 65 years) subgroup (12.2% and 9.4%, respectively) compared with the other age 
subgroups (ranging from 3.7% to 7.6% and from 0% to 4.9%, respectively).  
Race  
The overall distributions of adverse events for the race subgroups of Asian, Black/African American, 
and White in the final analysis safety population were generally similar, except that the Black/African 
American subgroup had the highest incidence of adverse events considered to be related to study drug 
(91.2% for relugolix) compared with the White subgroup (75.2%) or the Asian subgroup (64.3%). This 
observation may be driven by the higher incidences of hot flush, fatigue, and weight increased 
observed for the Black/African American subgroup than for the White and Asian subgroups. Fewer 
serious adverse events were reported for the Black/African American subgroup (5.9% for relugolix) 
than for the White subgroup (14.0%) or the Asian subgroup (10.2%).  
Ethnicity  
The overall distributions of adverse events for the ethnicity subgroups of Not Hispanic or Latino (N 
=640), and Hispanic or Latino (N =64) in the final analysis safety population were generally similar 
(91.7% vs. 100%, respectively). The Not Hispanic or Latino subgroup had a lower incidence of adverse 
events leading to study drug discontinuation (3.1% for relugolix) compared with the Hispanic or Latino 
subgroup (9.4% for relugolix). 
2.6.8.7.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Relugolix is a P-gp substrate and co-administration with oral P-gp inhibitors increase the area under 
the curve (AUC) and the maximum concentration (Cmax) of relugolix, which may increase the risk of 
adverse reactions associated with Orgovyx. Co-administration with erythromycin, a P-gp and moderate 
CYP3A inhibitor, increased the AUC and Cmax of relugolix by 3.5- and 2.9-fold respectively, due to 
inhibition of intestinal P-gp by erythromycin, which resulted in an increase in the oral bioavailability of 
relugolix.

In study MVT-601-3201, AEs that led to study drug withdrawal were reported for 22 patients (3.5%) in 
the relugolix group and one patient (0.3%) in the leuprolide group. The incidence of AEs that led to 
withdrawal or fatal outcome was comparable between the relugolix group (3.9%) and the leuprolide 
group (3.2%). 
This imbalance for withdrawal is likely due to the fact that the study drug is given as a daily oral dose 
and the control leuprolide as a 3-month depot formulation.  
Assessment report  
EMA/218094/2022  
Page 160/176 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There were no AEs resulting in study drug withdrawal reported for more than one patient, except 
atrioventricular block second degree (in two patients in the relugolix group and no patient in the 
leuprolide group).  
No pattern of events leading to study drug withdrawal was noted in the supportive prostate cancer 
studies. 
2.6.8.9.  Post marketing experience 
Relugolix monotherapy is approved for separate indications in two countries, Japan (40 mg, uterine 
fibroid indication) and the US (120 mg, advanced prostate cancer indication), respectively.  
No post marketing data are available for relugolix 120 mg in advanced prostate cancer patients as the 
product was only launched on 04 January 2021 in the US.  
From 01 March 2019 to 07 July 2020, 23 SAEs were reported on 6,293,000 patient-days in relatively 
healthy female patients of fertile age. SAEs that may be applicable to the current male patient group of 
advanced prostate cancer patients are 2 cases of anaphylactic reaction, 1 case of drug eruption and 
malaise, 1 case of hypertension, 1 case of pulmonary embolism, and 1 case of multiple sclerosis 
relapse. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Like degarelix, relugolix is a GnRH-receptor antagonist, so there is previous safety experience. Further, 
a large amount of safety experience is available from GnRH agonists, which, although after an initial 
flare up of testosterone of about one month, have a comparable degree of testosterone suppression. In 
the current dossier, the primary safety data are derived from the comparative pivotal phase 3 study 
versus leuprorelin 3-month depot-injection MVT-601-3201, which is divided as follows: 
• 
Pivotal phase 3 study (MVT-601-3201) 
−  Primary Analysis Safety Population 
− 
Final Analysis Safety Population 
−  Metastatic Patient Safety Population 
Supportive safety data include: 
−  Other Prostate cancer studies (C27002 phase 2 study versus leuprorelin in patients with advanced 
prostate cancer, phase 2 study C27003 versus degarelix (GnRH-antagonist) in participants with 
localized prostate cancer + radiotherapy and phase 1 study TB-AK160108 in hormone treatment-
naïve participants with non-metastatic prostate cancer. 
− 
In addition, the discussion of liver safety also includes adverse events of clinical interest from the 
clinical pharmacology studies and for the pooled Women’s Health 12-Week Monotherapy Safety 
Population. In the sections for discussion of hypersensitivity and QT prolongation, relevant data 
from the clinical pharmacology studies also are presented. 
Patient exposure. The primary safety analysis included 622 patients in the relugolix group and 308 
patients in the leuprorelin group. The safety analysis included 717 and 357 patients in the relugolix 
and leuprolide group, respectively. 
The primary analysis of safety and efficacy occurred after 934 patients were randomized to the study 
(Cohort 1) and completed the 48-week treatment period and 30-day safety follow-up visit or 
Assessment report  
EMA/218094/2022  
Page 161/176 
 
 
 
 
 
discontinued early. The final analysis of the study occurred after 434 patients with metastatic disease 
(of whom 295 patients were also included in the primary analysis [Cohort 1]) were randomized to the 
study (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2) and completed the 48-week treatment period and 30-day safety follow-
up visit or discontinued early. The study remains ongoing.  
In this phase 3 study, a total of 298 patients received relugolix 102 mg after an initial bolus of 360 mg 
and 238 received the GnRH-agonist leuprorelin for more than 48 weeks. The mean duration of 
relugolix use was 45.52 weeks. Overall, the documented safety exposure to relugolix exceeds the 
requirements of ICH-E1 and is considered sufficient for adequate assessment of the safety profile of 
relugolix in patients with advanced prostate cancer. 
Adverse events profile. In the primary analysis of the pivotal study, AEs were frequently reported 
with similar incidence for the two treatment groups: 578 patients (92.9%) in the relugolix group and 
288 patients (93.5%) in the leuprolide group. Of note, in the pivotal study MVT-601-3201, as is 
standard procedure, patients in the leuprolide group could receive an antiandrogen for the first 4 
weeks or longer if indicated for disease flare management (temporary increase in testosterone which 
could lead to disease exacerbation) in the opinion of the investigator. Additionally, bone preserving 
medication was permitted at the discretion of the Investigator. 
Common adverse events. The mechanism of action of GnRH agonists and antagonists is well 
understood. In general, the reported adverse events are in line with those known for androgen 
deprivation therapy. In the primary analysis of study MVT-601-3201, the most commonly reported 
(>10% patients) adverse events in any treatment group included hot flush, fatigue, constipation, 
diarrhoea, arthralgia, and hypertension. Constipation, diarrhoea, and arthralgia were reported at a 
greater incidence on relugolix, cardiovascular adverse events were seen more on leuprolide. 
Constipation, diarrhoea, and musculoskeletal pain (which includes arthralgia) are included in Section 
4.8 of the proposed SmPC for relugolix as ‘very common’ adverse drug reactions. The supportive 
prostate cancer studies showed a similar pattern of common AEs.  
Serious adverse events. The incidence of serious adverse events was lower for the relugolix group 
(12.2%; 76 patients) compared with leuprolide (15.3%; 47 patients). Drug-related serious adverse 
events were reported in both groups (six patients [1.0%] in the relugolix group and three patients 
[1.0%] in the leuprolide group). Serious adverse event that was a grade 3 maximum severity occurred 
in 8.0% of the relugolix group and 10.1% of the leuprolide group). No pattern indicative for a safety 
signal could be identified among the types of drug-related SAEs, which is reassuring. 
AEs of special interest. Safety parameters of clinical interest represent prespecified categories of 
adverse events that are either: 
• 
• 
• 
known toxicities of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with GnRH receptor agonists (carbohydrate 
and lipid metabolic effects, adverse cardiovascular events, loss of bone mineral density, QTc 
prolongation, mood disorders, and vasomotor symptoms),  
potential risks associated with relugolix based on nonclinical data (hepatic transaminase 
elevations), or  
theoretical risks with an investigational agent (hypersensitivity).  
Frequencies of general adverse events of special interest were comparable in both groups, although 
there were some small differences.  
−  Vasomotor symptoms  
Assessment report  
EMA/218094/2022  
Page 162/176 
 
 
 
 
Vasomotor symptoms (including mainly hot flush but also the terms hyperhidrosis, feeling hot, 
night sweats, and flushing) are known side effects of androgen deprivation therapy with GnRH 
receptor agonists. These were reported with the same incidence on relugolix (56.1%) and leuprolide 
(54.9%). Hot flush was the most common adverse event followed by hyperhidrosis and are listed in 
the proposed SmPC as adverse drug reactions. 
−  Hepatic transaminase elevations 
The evaluation of potential for hepatic transaminase elevations (ALT/AST) is based on non-clinical 
observations in monkeys exposed to a 48-times higher dose of relugolix, the clinical trial data, and 
data reported for drugs that work on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (GnRH receptor 
agonists [eg, leuprolide] and the GnRH receptor antagonists [eg, elagolix, degarelix). In the 
primary analysis of study MVT-601-3201, there were 13 patients with an adverse event of clinical 
interest (ALT and/or AST ≥ 3× ULN) reported during the study, 9 (1.4%) on relugolix and 4 (1.3%) 
on the leuprolide control. The proportion of patients with laboratory values meeting predefined 
limits of change at any time for ALT or AST were also similar in both treatment groups (7.6% vs 
5.5%, respectively). One serious adverse event of grade 4 liver function test abnormal was 
reported for a patient with widely metastatic disease in the leuprolide group; no action was taken 
with study drug leuprolide (this is also not possible as this is a 3-month depot formulation). One 
patient on relugolix discontinued study drug due to alanine aminotransferase increased. Although 
there were more adverse events identified per the Drug-Related Hepatic Disorders SMQ in the 
relugolix group, specifically the terms alanine aminotransferase increased and aspartate 
aminotransferase increased, mean ALT and AST concentrations over time were similar in both 
treatment groups.  
In the SmPC section 4.8 ‘ALT increased’ is included as an uncommon ADR and the following 
description is given below the table: “Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) concentrations > 3xULN were reported for 1.4% of patients with normal 
values prior to treatment, following treatment with relugolix. An increase to grade 3/4 ALT was 
observed in 0.3% of patients and to grade 3/4 AST in 0% of patients treated with relugolix, 
respectively. No events were associated with increased bilirubin.”  
However, as similar reporting of the PT term ASAT increased compared to ALAT increased and 
convergent data from laboratory findings were noted, ASAT increased is added in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC. 
−  Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: glucose metabolism  
Adverse events related to abnormal glucose metabolism were reported in both relugolix (5.8%) and 
leuprolide (6.2%) groups in the pivotal phase 3 study. ‘Diabetes mellitus’ was reported with a 
higher incidence on relugolix (3.7%) compared to leuprolide (1.9%); however, for ‘ type 2 diabetes 
mellitus’ this was lower with relugolix compared to leuprolide (0.5% and 1.9%, respectively). Most 
events of diabetes mellitus were exacerbations of existing diabetes. Glucose increased is included in 
the proposed PI as a common ADR. 
Adverse events related to abnormal lipid metabolism were similar in both groups (3.1% in the 
relugolix group and 2.3% in the leuprolide group). Individual events (including blood cholesterol 
increased, blood triglycerides increased, hypertriglyceridemia, dyslipidaemia, 
hypercholesterolaemia, and hyperlipidaemia) did not occur >1%, except Hypertriglyceridaemia in 
the leuprolide group (1.6%). Triglyceride increased is included in the proposed PI as a common 
ADR. Also reports of blood cholesterol increased and hypercholesterolemia AE as well as converging 
data from laboratory findings were noted, therefore blood cholesterol increased is also included in 
Assessment report  
EMA/218094/2022  
Page 163/176 
 
 
 
 
section 4.8 of the SmPC. Of note, blood cholesterol increased is also listed in the product 
information of degarelix, another GnRH antagonist. 
Of further interest, in section 4.4 and 4.8, other class warnings, such as glucose metabolism, has 
been included, in line with Degarelix. 
−  Hypersensitivity 
Hypersensitivity is a theoretical risk with a new investigational agent and is therefore investigated. 
In the primary analysis of study MVT-601-3201, incidence of adverse events related to 
hypersensitivity were reported for similar proportions of patients in both groups (44 patients [7.1%] 
in the relugolix group and 26 patients [8.4%] in the leuprolide group), with rash as the most 
common (3.2% and 2.3% of patients in each group, respectively). Therefore, the standard 
contraindication has been included (‘Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the 
excipients listed in section 6.1’). Additionally, ‘rash’ has been added in the ADR table in section 4.8.  
−  Mood disorders 
In the primary analysis of study MVT-601-3201, incidence of adverse events related to mood 
disorders were similar between relugolix and leuprolide (5.1% in the relugolix group and 4.5% in 
the leuprolide group), with depression as the most common (1.9% and 1.0% of patients in each 
group, respectively).  
Long duration low testosterone with GnRH agonists or antagonists is associated with change in mood 
disorders. There is no unbalance or trend in the adverse events that appears to point to a different 
pattern with regard to mood disorders compared to leuprolide. 
Depression is listed in the proposed prescribing information for relugolix (4.8), which is considered 
appropriate. It is also included in the SmPCs of degarelix (4.8) and leuprolide (4.4, 4.8). 
−  Loss of Bone Mineral Density (BMD) 
BMD loss is associated with testosterone deficiency in men, based on the mechanism of action for 
both GnRH agonists and antagonists, where hormone levels are decrease to castrate-levels for a 
longer period of time. BMD with bone densitometry was not assessed in the pivotal study MVT-
601-3201 as the 48-week treatment duration was not expected to result in clinically relevant bone 
mineral density loss in this patient population treated for advanced prostate cancer.  
Adverse events related to loss of bone mineral density were comparable between the two groups 
(3.2% and 3.9% of patients, respectively), as were the fracture-related adverse events (1.4% and 
1.0% of patients, respectively).  
For Study C27002, median percent changes in N-telopeptide from baseline at Week 49, Day 1 were 
approximately 32% and 43% in the relugolix 80-mg and 120-mg groups, respectively, and 
approximately 16% in the leuprorelin group. Median change in bone mineral density measured by 
DXA was -2%, -1.6% in the relugolix 80-mg and 120-mg groups, respectively, and -2.5% in the 
leuprorelin group. 
A warning for changes in bone mineral density is included in the SmPC 4.4, and 
osteoporosis/osteopenia is included in the table in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
−  QTc Interval Prolongation 
QT-prolongation is a class effect of androgen deprivation therapy. Adverse events related to QTc 
prolongation were searched for using the Torsade de pointes/QT prolongation SMQ (broad).  
In pivotal study MVT-601-3201, adverse events potentially related to QTc prolongation were 
reported for a similar proportion of patients in both pooled relugolix and leuprolide groups (2.1% 
vs. 1.9%, respectively. Clinically significant ECG abnormalities at ECG 12-lead screening were 
Assessment report  
EMA/218094/2022  
Page 164/176 
 
 
 
 
found in 4.3% in the relugolix group and 2.9% in the leuprolide group. The study did not collect 
details of ECGs besides the investigator’s determination of clinical significance.  
The phase 1 dedicated thorough QT study with parallel design (60 mg, supratherapeutic 360 mg, 
placebo and positive control (moxifloxacin) did not suggest for any QT prolonging effect of relugolix 
with point estimates for the corrected ddQTcF around 5 ms and thus far below the 10 ms for 
regulatory concern.  
For the relugolix SmPC a warning and precaution for the potential for QTc prolongation is reflected 
in SmPC section 4.4 to address the known effects of androgen deprivation on the QT interval and 
to include the results of the thorough QT study, in line with the SmPC of the GnRH-antagonist 
degarelix. Furthermore, QT-prolongation has been included in the SmPC in the table in Section 4.8. 
Of note, in the SmPC for Ryeqo (40 mg +E2/NETA) for women, no warning is given for QT 
prolongation.  
−  Adverse cardiovascular events 
Adverse cardiovascular events are a known side effect of androgen deprivation therapy. Studies 
have also found a higher risk of major cardiovascular events in patients with prostate cancer 
treated with GnRH receptor agonists compared with GnRH receptor antagonists, particularly in men 
with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. 
In the pivotal study MVT-601-3201, after 48 weeks of treatment, adverse cardiovascular events 
were reported in less patients in the relugolix group: 24 (3.9%) of patients in the relugolix group 
and for 22 (7.1%) in the leuprolide group. Of note, the reporting rates retrieved may be increased 
in real life conditions considering exclusion of patients with previous significant cardiac conditions 
within 6 months in pivotal study. 
Also MACE were reported in 18 patients [2.9%] patients in the relugolix group and 19 patients 
[6.2%] in the leuprorelin group. All but five of the MACE events were serious adverse events. 
Among the MACE, proportion of patients was smaller in the cardiovascular portion only: 9 (1.4%) 
patients on relugolix and 2 (0.6%) on leuprolide; deaths due to all causes: 7 (1.1%) and 9 
(2.9%); MACE in patients with medical history of MACE: 3 (3.6%) and 8 (17.8%); and MACE in 
patients without medical history of MACE: 15 (2.8%) and 11 (4.2%). However, proportion of 
patients was larger for cerebrovascular portion only of MACE: 4 (0.6%) and 10 (3.2%); and 
ischemic heart disease: 15 (2.4%) and 5 (1.6%). 
An assessment of risk factors (life-style risk factors, any cerebrovascular or cardiovascular risk 
factor, and any history of MACE) showed a similar proportion of patients in each group reporting 
any risk factor for cerebrovascular and/or cardiovascular disease (91.6% in the relugolix group and 
94.2% in the leuprolide group); this was also the case across the three categories. When the 
incidence was adjusted for exposure to treatment, the exposure-adjusted event rate for an adverse 
event associated with MACE was 3.3 in the relugolix group and 7.0 in the leuprolide group. With 
regard to age, the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events for relugolix was highest for the 
oldest subgroup (≥ 85 years), 7.4% compared with other age subgroups (ranging from 2.9% and 
4.9%). 
Based on the results of the pivotal phase 3 study, it seems that there were less cardiovascular 
events and MACE observed on relugolix compared to leuprolide. However, MACE events were not 
adjudicated, but a MACE composite query by treatment group (Myocardial Infarction SMQ, Central 
Nervous System Haemorrhages and Cerebrovascular Conditions SMQ, and deaths due to all 
causes) and the Ischaemic Heart Disease SMQ (which contains two sub-SMQs, the Myocardial 
Infarction SMQ [broad] and the Other Ischaemic Heart Disease SMQ [broad]) was used in the 
prespecified safety analyses. 
The Applicant gives as rationale for not using adjudicated cases, that the reported events were 
consistent with the events recommended to be included by the 2017 Cardiovascular and Stroke 
Assessment report  
EMA/218094/2022  
Page 165/176 
 
 
 
 
Endpoint Definitions publication (developed by the Standardized Data Collection for Cardiovascular 
Trials Initiative and FDA); also, the SMQ for MACE was agreed with the FDA prior to database lock. 
Further, MACE was not a key endpoint in the study. 
In this case, from a statistical viewpoint, there are relatively few MACE and adjudication would 
probably lower the number, thereby not increasing sensitivity (false negative turning positive) but 
only increasing specificity (removing false positives). Therefore, adjudication at this point may not 
be considered useful. However, the Applicant has also calculated a hazard ratio, including a 
statistically significant p-value. Such analysis is not acceptable when based on unadjudicated (and 
therefore not validated) data. Furthermore, the analysis method was not prespecified in the SAP, 
nor was the endpoint included in the hierarchical testing strategy. So, these results should not be 
included in the SmPC. However, cardiac disorders included the Adverse event table in section 4.8. 
Further, section 4.4 of the SmPC includes a general warning on the risk of cardiovascular events, 
which is similar to the warning included in the SmPC of degarelix (Firmagon):  
“Cardiovascular disease 
Cardiovascular disease such as myocardial infarction and stroke has been reported in the medical 
literature in patients with androgen deprivation therapy. Therefore, all cardiovascular risk factors 
should be taken into account.” 
The inclusion of this general warning is considered acceptable. 
−  Second primary malignancies 
A post hoc analysis was performed to evaluate the occurrence and type of second primary 
malignancies. In the primary analysis of pivotal study MVT-601-3201, second primary malignancies 
were reported more often in the relugolix group (19 patients [3.1%]) compared with the leuprolide 
group (three patients [1.0%]). There was no clear imbalance for a specific tumour type. In the 
relugolix group there was an even distribution over the 48-week period. 
The most common in both groups were nonmelanoma skin cancers. According to the literature, the 
annual incidence in the general population appears to be at least 1%. The incidence of the other 
malignancies reported for the relugolix and leuprolide groups is generally consistent with the risks 
for these malignancies in older men. Overall, there is no apparent signal regarding the 
development of second primary malignancies during treatment with relugolix in patients with 
prostate cancer. Such events will continue to be monitored in routine pharmacovigilance. 
Clinical laboratory findings 
All clinical laboratory tests conducted throughout the study, including haematology, chemistry, 
urinalysis, and lipids, were comparable between the two groups.  
Vital signs 
No changes or trends were identified with regard to systolic and diastolic blood pressures and mean 
heart rates between the two groups or in time.  
No changes or trends were identified with regard to ECG abnormalities. There were no obvious 
differences between the two groups in the pivotal study.  
Safety in special populations 
Subgroup analyses were performed for the study MVT-601-3201 Final Analysis Safety Population using 
the intrinsic factors (age, race, ethnicity, and diagnosis [presence or absence of metastatic disease]).

No specific patterns were identified that would suggest a differential safety profile of relugolix in the 
different subgroups of patients. Regarding age, the observations for the oldest subgroup did not 
appear to be driven by any particular type of AE; the sample size for the age subgroup of ≥ 85 years is 
small (N = 27 for relugolix and N = 19 for leuprolide), thus making comparisons with larger subgroups 
difficult to interpret. AEs reported more frequently in the older age groups include cataract, fall, and 
decreased appetite, all events associated with advancing age, independent of concomitant medication. 
There was no evidence of clustering of specific adverse events by age subgroup. Regarding race, 
interpretation of these findings is limited by the small sample size of the Black/African American 
subgroup (N =34 for relugolix), thus making comparison with the larger subgroups difficult. Overall, 
the differences in the adverse event profile of relugolix in subgroups defined by race do not appear to 
be clinically meaningful. Regarding ethnicity, the observed differences between the two ethnicity 
subgroups did not appear to be attributable to any specific adverse event. Regarding parameters of 
clinical interest, the incidence of carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects was lower for the Not 
Hispanic or Latino subgroup (8.1% for relugolix) than for those of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity (14.1%). 
No other notable differences were observed for the incidences of parameters of clinical interest. It has 
been previously described that individuals of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity are at a higher risk for 
abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism relative to those without that ethnic background (Aguayo-
Mazzucato et al. 2019). 
Renal impairment 
No important differences in safety findings were observed for relugolix in subgroups defined by renal 
function in the pivotal phase 3 study (MVT-601-3201) Final Analysis Safety Population. The overall 
distributions of adverse events for the three renal function subgroups (CrCl ≥ 30 to < 60, ≥ 60 to < 
90, and ≥ 90 mL/min) were similar. However, for the severe renal function subgroup (CrCl <30 
mL/min) only four subjects were included. 
However, since the effect of severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of relugolix does not fall 
within the comparability bounds of 0.50 to 1.50, the Applicant needs to mention this effect in the 
“Special warning and precautions for use” Section 4.4 of the SmPC. See previous section on clinical 
pharmacology. 
Hepatic impairment 
The mean half-life of relugolix in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment and healthy 
control subjects were comparable. See previous section. 
No dose adjustments for Orgovyx in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment are required. 
The effects of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of relugolix have not been 
evaluated. 
Deaths 
Sixteen deaths were reported in study MVT-601-3201 at the time of the primary analysis (7 ([1.1%] in 
the relugolix group and 9 [2.9%] in the leuprolide group) and five deaths (4 relugolix, 1 leuprolide) 
were reported in study C27002. In the final analysis of study MVT-601-3201, five additional patients 
(three relugolix, two leuprolide) died (relugolix group acute respiratory failure, death [suspect 
metastatic prostate cancer], and myocardial infarction; leuprolide group: COVID-19 pneumonia and 
prostate cancer). All cases were assessed by the investigator as not related to study drug, with the 
exception of one fatal case that was considered possibly related: a 74-year old patient on relugolix for 
138 days had a fatal acute myocardial infarction. There was no trends or pattern identified among the 
fatal cases.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions  
Assessment report

This is discussed under clinical pharmacology. In the SmPC section 4.5, a warning is given to avoid co-
administration with Orgovyx and oral P-gp inhibitors, including how to handle if co-administration 
cannot be avoided. 
Discontinuations due to AEs  
In study MVT-601-3201, adverse events that led to study drug withdrawal were reported for 22 
patients (3.5%) in the relugolix group and one patient (0.3%) in the leuprolide group. This imbalance 
for withdrawal is due to the fact that relugolix is given as a daily oral dose and the control leuprolide as 
a 3-month depot formulation which cannot be removed. There were no adverse events resulting in 
study drug withdrawal reported for more than one patient, except atrioventricular block second degree 
(in two patients in the relugolix group). No pattern of events leading to study drug withdrawal was 
noted in the supportive prostate cancer studies. 
The safety data of the other prostate cancer studies (C27002, C27003, and TB-AK160108) are 
consistent with the safety findings observed in the pivotal phase 3 study MVT-601-3201. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Generally, the safety profile of relugolix is in line with leuprorelin and reflects its mechanism of action 
as an ADT. The rate of MACE on relugolix compared with that of leuprolide seems to be lower, though 
because of statistical considerations, a low overall number of events and because the MACE events 
were not adjudicated, no definitive conclusion can be drawn. Additionally, the oral route of relugolix 
has an advantage over GnRH agonists, as the oral treatment can be discontinued immediately. Further 
advantage is the absence of an initial temporary increase in testosterone (flare-up) which may lead to 
disease exacerbation noted with GnRH-agonists, as with an GnRH-antagonist like relugolix testosterone 
levels decrease within days.

2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Orgovyx (relugolix) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Orgovyx is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced hormone-sensitive prostate 
cancer. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
During more than 60 years the treatment of choice in metastatic prostate cancer has been androgen 
depletion therapy (ADT). Currently androgen depletion is often introduced in the adjuvant setting or at 
PSA relapse without detectable metastases (EMA/CHMP/703715/2012 Rev. 2). Long-acting GnRH 
agonists are currently the main forms of ADT, delivered as depot injections on a 1-, 2-, 3-, 6-monthly, 
or yearly, basis (2021 EAU Guidelines on prostate cancer). Firmagon (degarelix) is a GnRH antagonist, 
just like relugolix, but it is delivered as a depot injection, just like the GnRH agonists. Its practical 
shortcoming, however, is the lack of a long-acting depot formulation with, so far, only a monthly 
formulation being available (2021 EAU Guidelines on prostate cancer). It was approved in 2009 for the 
treatment of adult male patients with advanced hormone-dependent prostate cancer (Firmagon 
SmPC). This approval was mainly based on the pivotal, randomized, open-label phase 3 study CS21 of 
degarelix vs leuprolide in patients with prostate cancer requiring ADT (Klotz et al. BJU Int. 2008; 
Firmagon MAA EPAR). 
It has been stated in scientific literature that the potential benefits of a daily-dosed oral agent could be 
multiple: ADT without an injectable depot (1) offers a more patient-friendly alternative with limited 
health care provider visits or procedures and no risk of local site reactions; (2) allows more flexible 
dosing and an option for prompt cessation of treatment due to intolerance or treatment-related side 
effects; and (3) eliminates the need for a lead-in antiandrogen to counteract potential testosterone 
flare induced with LHRH agonist-based treatments (Sachdev et al. Eur Urol. 2020). However, oral ADT 
is not without its own drawbacks. Depot formulation can offer reliable, sustained plasma delivery 
without reliance on patient adherence, interactions with other oral medications, or gastrointestinal 
absorption. The bothersome side-effect profile of ADT may lead to earlier cessation or interruption of 
oral therapy by patients. Furthermore, while in studies good adherence to oral dosing of medications 
may be shown, real-life compliance to long-term daily dosing is likely to be less optimal. Lastly, it is 
unclear if more rapid testosterone recovery would make the drug effect of the same nominal duration 
as in trials using GnRH agonist depot injection-based treatment (Sachdev et al. Eur Urol. 2020), and a 
shorter duration of testosterone suppression with relugolix (due to faster testosterone recovery) could 
lead to undertreatment given that cancer control has been associated with the duration of testosterone 
suppression (Mahal et al. Eur Urol. 2020). In conclusion, whereas there is perhaps not a high unmet 
medical need for an oral formulation of a GnRH receptor antagonist, it can be considered a valuable 
addition to the treatment armamentarium for advanced hormone-dependent prostate cancer. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
In the pivotal, randomized, open-label phase 3 study MVT--601-3201 (Shore et al. N Engl J Med. 
2020) the safety and efficacy of oral relugolix vs leuprolide depot injections was evaluated in adult 
Assessment report  
EMA/218094/2022  
Page 170/176 
 
 
 
 
 
patients with androgen-sensitive advanced prostate cancer who required at least 1 year of continuous 
ADT for the management of their disease and who were not candidates for surgical or radiation 
therapy with curative intent. A total of 624 patients were randomized (2:1) to receive relugolix- (360 
mg on Day 1 followed by 120 mg QD for 48 weeks) and 310 patients were randomized to receive 
leuprolide (22.5 mg Q12W for 48 weeks). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
• 
In the relugolix group, 96.7% of patients (95% CI: 94.9%, 97.9%) achieved and maintained 
sustained testosterone suppression below castrate levels (< 50 ng/dL) from Week 5 Day 1 (Day 
29) to Week 49 Day 1 (Day 337) with the lower bound of the 95% CI exceeding 90% (Evaluation 
Criterion 1). In comparison, 88.8% of patients (95% CI: 84.6%, 91.8%) in the leuprolide group 
achieved and maintained sustained castration during the same period. The between-group 
difference was 7.9% (95% CI: 4.1%, 11.8%), demonstrating non-inferiority of relugolix to 
leuprolide as the lower bound of the 95% CI for the difference between groups was greater than 
the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of -10% (Evaluation Criterion 2) (p <0.0001; HR = 0.2321 
[95% CI: 0.1489, 0.4613]). 
•  Results from three of the four sensitivity analyses were consistent with the primary analysis of the 
primary endpoint for sustained castration rate in the relugolix group (Evaluation Criterion 1). Per 
the rather conservative Sensitivity Analysis 3, the results were generally consistent with the 
primary analysis but did not meet Evaluation Criterion 1. All four sensitivity analyses demonstrated 
non-inferiority of relugolix compared with leuprolide (Evaluation Criterion 2). 
• 
In virtually all subgroups, the result confirmed the results of the primary analysis of the primary 
endpoint, both for Evaluation Criterion 1 and 2. 
•  On Day 4, the castration rate was higher in the relugolix group compared with the leuprolide 
group, i.e. 56.04% (95% CI: 52.18, 59.97) vs 0% (95% CI: NE, NE), respectively (p < 0.0001). 
•  On Day 15, the castration rate was higher in the relugolix group compared with the leuprolide 
group, i.e. 98.71% (95% CI: 97.56, 99.39) vs 12.05% (95% CI: 8.88, 16.25), respectively 
(p < 0.0001). 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The proportion of patients with a > 50% reduction in PSA on Day 15 and confirmed at Day 29 was 
higher in the relugolix group compared with the leuprolide group, i.e. 79.4% (95% CI: 76.03, 
82.53) vs 19.8% (95% CI: 15.50, 24.70), respectively (p < 0.0001). 
The rate of profound castration (< 20 ng/dL) on day 15 was higher in the relugolix group 
compared with the leuprolide group, i.e. 78.38% (95% CI: 75.06, 81.53) vs 0.98% (95% CI: 0.32, 
3.00), respectively (p < 0.0001). 
The mean FSH level (SD) on day 169 was suppressed to a larger extent in the relugolix group 
compared with the leuprolide group, i.e. to 1.72 (1.376) IU/L vs 5.95 (3.071) IU/L, respectively 
(p < 0.0001). 
There was a trend (only) for a higher rate of testosterone recovery to > 280 ng/dL at 90 days after 
drug discontinuation in the relugolix group compared with the leuprolide group, i.e. 53.93% 
(95% CI: 45.20, 63.16) vs 3.23% (95% CI: 0.46, 20.77), respectively (nominal p = 0.0017).

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Both the primary endpoint as well as all secondary endpoints that were tested statistically are of 
pharmacodynamic nature or concern a biomarker, and are not clinical measures of patient benefit per 
se. 
The Applicant has not provided a rationale for the sample size for the key secondary endpoint of 
testosterone recovery, nor any detailed information on how patients were selected for the subset to be 
followed for testosterone recovery. The latter could be a possible source of bias for this key secondary 
endpoint. These issues were not pursued, as this key secondary endpoint was not formally 
tested/analysed and was for exploratory purposes only. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The most frequently reported adverse events for patients in the pivotal phase 3 study comparative 
trial versus the GnRH agonist leuprorelin were hot flush (54.3% on relugolix vs 51.6% on leuprolide) 
and fatigue (21.5% vs 18.5%). The frequencies for adverse events in ≥5% of patients were similar 
both on relugolix and on leuprolide, except for constipation (12.2% vs 9.7%), diarrhoea (12.2% vs 
6.8%), arthralgia (12.1% vs 9.1%), and hypertension (7.9% vs 11.7%). All constipation and diarrhoea 
adverse events were mild or moderate, there were no serious adverse events of constipation or 
diarrhoea and median duration of both adverse events was similar. 
In study MVT-601-3201, adverse events that led to study drug withdrawal were reported for 22 
patients (3.5%) in the relugolix group and one patient (0.3%) in the leuprolide group. This imbalance 
for withdrawal is likely due to the fact that the study drug is given as a daily oral dose and the control 
leuprolide as a 3-month depot formulation. 
In study MVT-601-3201, adverse events of hepatic transaminase elevation were reported for a slightly 
higher proportion of patients in the relugolix group compared with the leuprolide group (7.6% vs. 
5.5%, respectively). However, ALT and AST values over time and a summary of hepatic laboratory 
abnormalities showed a similar profile of hepatic transaminases for both groups. No evidence of drug-
induced liver injury was observed.

b Time to testosterone recovery was performed at the primary analysis for exploratory purposes without formal

resistance-free survival (see Table 10); however, the testosterone recovery analysis was not formally tested at the 
final analysis, because the results for castration resistance-free survival did not achieve statistical superiority. 
3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The pivotal study met its primary endpoint, as treatment with relugolix resulted in a sustained 
castration rate of ≥ 90%, i.e. a testosterone level < 50 ng/dL from Day 29 through 337 (Evaluation 
Criterion 1), plus treatment with relugolix was noninferior to treatment with leuprolide as assessed by 
(this) sustained testosterone suppression rate (Evaluation Criterion 2). The results of the sensitivity 
and subgroup analyses are considered to support the robustness of the primary efficacy analysis of the 
primary endpoint. All key secondary endpoints tested hierarchically at the primary analysis, except for 
(time to) testosterone recovery, demonstrated superiority over/confirmed (at least) noninferiority to 
leuprolide. Achievement of castrate levels of testosterone is an acceptable primary efficacy endpoint in 
patients with hormone-sensitive advanced prostate cancer and is considered to meet the CHMP 
regulatory requirements (see Vantas Article 29(4) referral procedure [CHMP/247760/07] and EMA 
guidance [EMA/CHMP/703715/2012 Rev. 2]). 
The results from the supportive studies, notwithstanding the slightly different relugolix dosages used 
and the fact that formal statistical testing was not conducted, can be considered to provide support for 
the activity of relugolix in lowering testosterone to castration levels in a sustainable manner, in 
patients with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. 
Assessment report  
EMA/218094/2022  
Page 174/176 
 
 
 
 
 
Safety data are primarily based on the pivotal phase 3 study MVT-601-3201, with a total of 298 
patients who received oral relugolix 120 mg after an initial bolus of 360 mg for more than 48 weeks. 
The mean duration of relugolix use was 45.52 weeks. The documented safety exposure exceeds the 
requirements of ICH-E1 and is considered sufficient for adequate assessment of the safety profile of 
relugolix. Relugolix is well-tolerated since the majority of the AEs are mild to moderate in severity, and 
the discontinuations due to adverse events are low. Generally, the reported adverse events are in line 
with the safety profile of the comparator. No new safety issues or trends were identified in the safety 
data package provided. The potential risks and adverse drug reactions are sufficiently covered in the 
product information. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In patients with androgen-sensitive advanced prostate cancer, treatment with relugolix resulted in 
adequate, sustained castration up to approximately one year of treatment duration, and demonstrated 
non-inferiority in terms of castration to standard of care treatment with leuprolide. Relugolix has been 
generally well-tolerated in most study patients with advanced prostate cancer. The most common 
adverse drug reactions are associated with low testosterone including hot flush, fatigue, and arthralgia. 
The potential risks of relugolix as a GnRH receptor antagonist are well known and include hepatic 
transaminase elevations, carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects, adverse cardiovascular events, QT 
prolongation and mood disorders.  
Based on the above, a positive benefit-risk balance can be concluded. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The initially proposed indication was amended to adequately reflect the pivotal study population, i.e. 
patients with hormone-sensitive advanced prostate cancer, and be aligned with relevant precedents 
(Firmagon, Xtandi, Erleada, and Zytiga). Further, the data/results from study MVT-601-3201 are not 
considered sufficient proof of patient benefit beyond the hormone-sensitive prostate cancer setting and 
any indication beyond the hormone-sensitive prostate cancer setting would not be in line with EMA 
guidance and regulatory precedents. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Orgovyx is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations

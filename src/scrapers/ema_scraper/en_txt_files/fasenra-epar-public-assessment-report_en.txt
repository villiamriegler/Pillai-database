1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant AstraZeneca AB submitted on 24 November 2016 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Fasenra, through the centralised procedure 
falling within the Article 3(1) and point 1 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the 
centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 1 April 2016. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Fasenra is indicated as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe asthma with an eosinophilic 
phenotype in adult patients. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical 
and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0213/2016 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0213/2016 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance benralizumab contained in the above medicinal product to 
be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a medicinal 
product previously authorised within the European Union.

phenotype in adult patients.

2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways caused by the interaction of genetic and 
environmental factors. It is characterised by widespread, variable, and reversible airflow obstruction; 
airway inflammation; excessive mucus production; and airway hyperresponsiveness that lead to 
recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing. Progressive pathologic 
airway remodelling and scarring may occur in persistent asthma resulting in partially reversible or 
irreversible airway obstruction. 
Asthma affects children and adults of all ages. It is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide, 
imposing a substantial social and economic burden. Globally, an estimated 300 million individuals are 
affected by asthma and this is projected to reach more than 400 million by 2020 (Peters et al 2006). 
Asthma is also responsible for 346,000 deaths annually. Asthma occurs in all countries regardless of the 
level of development. In the European Union (EU), reported prevalence varies between 1.5% in Romania 
to 18.4% within Scotland (GINA 2016). 
Asthma presents with varying degrees of severity, ranging from mild, intermittent disease to severe 
presentations with debilitating, even life-threatening symptoms. Severe asthma is defined as asthma that 
requires treatment with medium- to high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus a second controller 
(and/or systemic corticosteroids) to prevent it from becoming uncontrolled, or that remains uncontrolled 
despite this therapy (Chung et al 2014). Patients who remain uncontrolled continue to suffer symptoms, 
frequent exacerbations, and compromised quality of life. Exacerbations typically require treatment with 
high doses of systemic corticosteroids and may also require hospitalisation. Uncontrolled asthma can lead 
to a dependence on oral corticosteroids, which has a significant impact on patients; systemic 
corticosteroid exposure leads to serious and irreversible adverse effects, including osteoporosis, anxiety, 
depression, weight gain, glaucoma, and diabetes. 
While the prevalence of uncontrolled severe asthma is estimated to be only 5% to 10% of the total 
asthmatic population (Barnes and Woolcock 1998, Busse et al 2000, O’Byrne et al 2012), these patients 
experience considerable morbidity (Polosa and Morjaria 2008) and account for approximately 50% of the 
total health care costs associated with asthma (Cisternas et al 2003). 
2.1.3.  Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
Asthma comprises a number of distinct phenotypes, most notably eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic 
asthma, based on the cell profile of induced sputum samples (Simpson et al 2006, Hancox et al 2012). 
Eosinophils are bone marrow-derived granulocytes that have long been recognised as the major 
inflammatory cells involved in the pathobiology of both childhood-onset, allergic asthma and adult-onset, 
nonallergic asthma (De Groot at al 2015). 
• 
In childhood-onset, allergic asthma, T-helper (Th)2 cells are believed to drive the immune response, 
as greater expression of Th2 cytokines including IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 is seen in allergen-challenged 
individuals, along with downregulation of Th1 cytokines (IL-2 and interferon-γ).  
•  Adult-onset eosinophilic asthma frequently develops in the absence of allergen-dependent activation 
of Th2 lymphocytes, which suggests a distinct underlying mechanism of eosinophilic inflammation 
apart from allergy. Recent evidence suggests that innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) have a central role in 
driving this type of eosinophilic asthma. 
Assessment report  
EMA/780390/2017  
Page 8/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Thus, in asthma, two different pathways driven by either allergen-specific Th2 cells or 
allergen-independent ILC2s may lead to production of IL-5, which induces eosinophilic airway 
inflammation as it plays an important role in the migration, maturation and survival of eosinophils. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The term “eosinophilic asthma” describes a subphenotype of asthma that is characterised by elevated 
levels of eosinophils in bronchial biopsies or sputum despite chronic and correct use of adequate doses of 
ICS. Apart from eosinophilic airway inflammation that is relatively steroid resistant, the eosinophilic 
asthma phenotype is characterised by specific clinical, functional and inflammatory characteristics and 
comorbidities: few or no allergies to common allergens, elevated eosinophils in peripheral blood, at risk of 
severe exacerbations, low FEV1 and often persistent airflow limitation, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal 
polyposis, good response to systemic corticosteroids and anti-IL-5 treatment. 
Patients with eosinophilic asthma should ideally be diagnosed by analysing sputum samples. However, 
blood eosinophilia seems to be the most feasible surrogate marker to detect airway eosinophilia in 
patients with adult-onset airway disease in routine practice. A cut-off value of eosinophils of <0.09×
109/L has been associated with absence of airway eosinophilia in 92% of patients, whereas a value of ≥
0.41×109/L has been associated with sputum eosinophils ≥ 3% in 95% of patients (Westerhof 2015). 
2.1.5.  Management 
The current approach to anti-inflammatory controller therapy in asthma is based on a step-wise 
intensification of a daily maintenance regimen primarily centred around ICS and leukotriene receptor 
antagonists (LTRAs), with the addition of long-acting β2 agonists (LABAs) in patients with more severe 
asthma (GINA 2017). While the majority of asthma patients can be adequately controlled based on these 
guidelines, a subset of patients with severe asthma is often uncontrolled with the current standard of care 
(Steps 4 and 5), and their treatment remains a significant unmet need. 
There are three mAbs currently available for use as add-on treatment for severe asthma (GINA Step 5): 
omalizumab, mepolizumab, and reslizumab 
  Omalizumab is a mAb that binds to immunoglobulin E (IgE) and prevents binding of IgE to FcεRI 
(high-affinity IgE receptor), thereby reducing the amount of free IgE that is available to trigger the 
allergic cascade, decreasing multiple markers of airway inflammation, including eosinophils. 
Omalizumab is marketed for the treatment of moderate to severe persistent asthma in patients 12 
years of age and older based on specific body weight and a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to 
a perennial aeroallergen and symptoms that are inadequately controlled with ICS. 
  Mepolizumab is an interleukin-5 (IL-5) antagonist mAb. It inhibits the bioactivity of IL-5 by blocking 
the binding of IL-5 to the alpha chain of the IL-5R complex expressed on the eosinophil cell surface, 
thereby inhibiting IL-5 signalling and leading to reduced production and survival of eosinophils. 
Mepolizumab is currently marketed as an add-on treatment for severe refractory eosinophilic asthma 
in adult patients. 
  Reslizumab is also an IL-5 antagonist mAb, which binds specifically to IL-5 and interferes with IL-5 
binding to its cell-surface receptor. It binds human IL-5 blocking its biological function resulting in 
reduction of the survival and activity of eosinophils. Reslizumab is currently marketed as an add-on 
Assessment report  
EMA/780390/2017  
Page 9/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
therapy in adult patients with severe eosinophilic asthma inadequately controlled despite high-dose 
inhaled corticosteroids plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment. 
Since two anti-IL-5 mAbs with similar indication to that claimed by the Applicant are already authorised, 
the unmet medical need is not obvious. Mepolizumab is administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks and 
reslizumab intravenously every 4 weeks. 
2.2.  About the product 
Benralizumab is a humanised, afucosylated, interleukin-5 receptor alpha (IL-5Rα)-directed cytolytic 
IgG1κ monoclonal antibody. It binds to the alpha subunit of IL-5R with high affinity and specificity. This 
receptor is specifically expressed on the surface of eosinophils and basophils. The absence of fucose in the 
Fc domain of benralizumab results in high affinity for FcγRIII receptors on immune effectors cells such as 
natural killer (NK) cells leading to apoptosis of eosinophils and basophils through enhanced 
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Therefore, benralizumab has been developed in 
the treatment of eosinophilic asthma. 
The recommended posology is 30 mg of benralizumab by subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks for the 
first 3 doses, and then every 8 weeks thereafter, to be administered by a healthcare professional. 
2.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
Scientific advice has not been sought from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
on the quality development aspects. Scientific advice on the clinical development programme supporting 
the use of benralizumab was received from the EMA CHMP through Scientific Advice Procedures (March 
2013, EMA/CHMP/SAWP/290939/2013). 
The decision to study benralizumab in a severe patient population is consistent with feedback from the 
CHMP to focus on a severe patient population for the initial development programme. The primary and 
secondary endpoints and exacerbation definition are in line with CHMP feedback and European CHMP 
Guideline on the clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of asthma (draft version 
CHMP/EWP/2922/01 Rev.1 issued in July 2013). 
This advice regarding the design of the Phase III studies SIROCCO and CALIMA has been followed (e.g., 
endpoints, duration, patient population). Additional points were raised. 
 
The Applicant was advised to ensure eosinophils reached normal levels after termination of 
treatment. These data were not collected in SIROCCO and CALIMA as, given the unmet need for 
therapy for these patients, they were allowed to rollover into BORA, an extension study. However, 
there are data on eosinophil recovery available from earlier studies. 
  Drug-drug interaction studies were not conducted. The justification for this approach has been 
provided and the input data from sparse sampling is considered acceptable. 
  Criteria for discontinuation and reinstitution of therapy and potential risks associated with 
discontinuation and or reinstitution of therapy were not investigated in the Phase III clinical 
programme because benralizumab is intended to be a chronically administered treatment and 
discontinuation would lead to the return of eosinophils and symptoms. There are no data available on 
patients restarting treatment.

2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The Fasenra active substance is a humanized, afucosylated, immunoglobulin (IgG) G1 k monoclonal 
antibody (mAb). It is manufactured in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells using animal protein free cell 
culture medium. It is purified through three chromatographic steps, a low pH virus inactivation step, and 
a nanofiltration virus removal step. It is manufactured through a validated manufacturing process, 
referred as the Process 3 throughout the documentation. 
The Fasenra finished product is formulated as a 30 mg/mL protein solution in histidine /histidine 
hydrochloride, α,α-trehalose dehydrate, polysorbate 20 buffer and water for injections. It is 
manufactured through a validated manufacturing process.  
The Fasenra solution for injection is presented as a preservative-free sterile liquid in an accessorized 
single-dose pre-filled syringe (APFS) for subcutaneous administration containing a nominal label claim of 
30 mg in 1.0 mL. The syringe is an integral drug delivery device which follows the relevant requirements 
of Annex I of the Medical Devices Directive (93/42/EEC) and has been developed as per the ISO 
13485:2012 and other international consensus standards. The final finished product is to be 
commercialized in 1 pack with 1 pre-filled syringe. 
2.4.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Benralizumab is a humanised, afucosylated IgG1 κ monoclonal antibody targeting the alpha subunit of 
the human interleukin-5 receptor expressed on eosinophils and basophils. It has a high affinity for 
FcγRIIIA receptors expressed by natural killer cells and macrophages via which the antibody-dependent 
cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) effector function of benralizumab causes apoptosis of eosinophils and 
basophils. Afucosylation enhances affinity for FcγRIIIA receptors and the cell line used has been 
engineered to eliminate fucosylation competency. 
The antibody is composed of two identical heavy chains of approximately 49,400 Da each, and two 
identical light chains of approximately 23,500 Da each. N-linked biantennary complex type 
oligosaccharides are attached to each heavy chain at Asn-301. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Manufacture 
Manufacture is initiated from the thawing of a single WCB vial. The manufacture, control, characterisation 
and stability of the producing cell line (CHO) have been adequately addressed. The periodicity of the cell 
culture process is satisfactorily qualified. The host CHO cell strain is a FUT8 knockout strain rendering the 
cell line incompetent in the fucosylation of post translational carbohydrates. From the point of 
establishing the master cell bank (MCB) onwards no directly animal derived material enters the process. 
The manufacturing process and controls for the active substance have been defined to an appropriate 
level of detail. The process description includes details of the proven acceptable ranges (PAR) for critical 
Assessment report  
EMA/780390/2017  
Page 11/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
process parameters (CPP), non-critical process parameters (NCPP), in-process controls (IPC), process 
performance attributes (PA) and intermediate hold times.  
The definitions of process inputs as critical and non-critical process parameters (CPP and NCPP) and 
process outputs as in-process controls (IPC), microbial controls and performance attributes are accepted. 
For the purposes of lifecycle management, it is accepted that should changes to the control criteria and 
parameter classification be required that this will be managed via the Quality Management System (QMS) 
acknowledging that any proposal to modify any of the process parameter or process output classifications 
or control criteria as registered in Section S.2.2.3 and Section S.2.2.4 of the dossier will be made via the 
appropriate post approval submission for approval. It is also accepted that excursions from the registered 
limits / ranges, including those for CPP and IPC, would initiate a deviation report with conclusions on 
quality, safety and efficacy supported by an appropriate investigation via the Applicant’s own QMS. By 
reference to section 3.2.S of the dossier the same commitment to the lifecycle of the control strategy is 
accepted for the finished product. 
Process validation  
Process validation has been framed in the context of a three-stage approach that starts with process 
development as the first stage followed by process performance and qualification (PPQ) as the second 
stage and the final stage as ongoing process verification. A systematic risk-based approach to process 
characterisation and validation have been adopted. For manufacturing process characterisation, critical 
quality attribute designation is described which is then considered further in the process characterisation 
/ quality risk management (QRM) exercise. An enhanced style approach has been established from which 
process and material understanding is enhanced by leveraging both tacit and explicit knowledge, of which 
some is derived from further product specific experimentation e.g. via design of experiments (DoE), to 
derive a comprehensive manufacturing control strategy that is considered compatible with anticipated 
regulatory oversight over the product lifecycle. The risk assessment has been made in relation to an 
‘assessed range’ of proposed operation i.e. already incorporates risk mitigation by means of establishing 
the risk within a predefined range of operation and is not a true representation of all potential risk that 
may be associated with any one parameter when run outside of a proposed window of operability. 
Although this is technically building into the risk mitigation an element of parameter controllability this 
can be accepted since this ‘pre-assessed range’ is expected to represent an operating envelope based on 
extensive historical technology platform knowledge and capability accepted as tacit process knowledge. 
The tools employed during the QRM have been satisfactorily described. Data from design of experiments 
has been presented as computer modelled data in the form of a dashboard of prediction profiles 
incorporating model qualification and a summary of effect test of the modelled profiles. It has been 
confirmed that the summary of effect tests account for regions of the prediction profiles where the 
interaction between parameters concerned are most significant or, in the case of non-linear responses, 
the region where the highest effect is observed. The design of experiment matrices is not elucidated in the 
dossier nor is the resultant raw data but given the presented analysis of the data this is not a concern. It 
is the process characterisation studies that have qualified the proven accepted ranges (PAR) for process 
parameters described for each unit operation. The analyses of the data and knowledge sufficiently 
support the rationale to the decision-making process with regards the manufacturing process and its 
controls. The development activity also describes the evaluation of the overall commercial control 
strategy after consideration of the process characterisation. This effectively identified the specification 
parameters that are to be routinely monitored at release and during stability on top of the other process 
controls already identified. This is presented as a mitigation of risks associated with critical quality 
attributes by the overall control strategy, as devised, such that residual risk is considered acceptable

according to predetermined thresholds. Part of this risk mitigation does have an element of the 
controllability of the process within the predetermined and qualified PAR and this is acceptable. 
Potential concerns for leachables from the active substance manufacturing process have been sufficiently 
and adequately addressed. 
The process validation or PPQ has been considered an extension of the process development activity. The 
process is demonstrated to be consistent in its performance, robust and under control. Post validation 
facility modifications are accepted as having no impact on the validation status of the process. Validation 
of intermediate hold periods has been adequately performed as has that for reprocessing steps, column 
lifetime and shipping. 
Manufacturing process development 
Three manufacturing processes were used during the development of benralizumab. For the purposes of 
this submission the comparability studies and the data provided are considered satisfactory evidence of 
the extent of substance comparability between the different clinical phases, particularly between the 
pivotal clinical studies and the final commercial process. 
Characterisation 
Physico-chemical characterisation was performed with a testing approach appropriate to monoclonal 
antibodies. Orthogonal methods allowed confirming the primary structure and composition of 
benralizumab. The results from these analyses confirm that the molecular weight and primary sequence 
observed were consistent with the theoretical amino acid sequence of benralizumab.  
Charge variants are characterized by orthogonal methods. Their relevance is sufficiently discussed 
according to impact on biological activity. 
Secondary and tertiary structural analysis confirmed the folded state of benralizumab. The proposed 
potency assay is a cell-based assay. The cell-based bioassay is considered sufficient to control biological 
activity of benralizumab. 
Specification 
The specifications set for the release of benralizumab active substance have been set taking ICH Q6B 
guideline into account. The established acceptance criteria are adequate. 
The validation of non-compendial methods has been conducted as per the ICH Q2(R1) guideline. The 
validation reports on the methods applied on the control of active substance are also applicable to the 
same tests used for the control of the finished product and have been provided. For compendial methods 
for endotoxin and bioburden, the relevant pharmacopoeia references have been provided and the 
suitability of the methods for the control of benralizumab active substance and finished product has been 
adequately summarised. The validation results demonstrate that the methods selected for the control of 
active substance at release and stability are suitable for their intended purpose.  
The comparability between the different versions of benralizumab has been adequately discussed. The 
batch analyses provided indicate that all batches complied with the acceptance criteria. 
The acceptance criteria for batch release and stability of the active substance benralizumab were 
established based on a combination of approaches in line with ICH Q6B guideline: published limits 
Assessment report  
EMA/780390/2017

approach (compendial limits/guidance or literature); stability limits approach (clinical risk assessment 
and evaluated for process capability and adequate active substance and finished product shelf-life) and 
non-stability limits approach (pre-determined target based on manufacturing capability and 
product/formulation characterization). The decision tree for determination of acceptance criteria 
approach was presented.  
Container closure system 
The safety of the material in contact with the active substance is ensured by compliance with the relevant 
monographs. Leachables and extractables were adequately assessed. The leachables data support the 
safety of the container closure system and storage recommendations proposed for the active substance. 
Compatibility between active substance and the components of the proposed container closure system 
has been demonstrated by ongoing stability studies with maintenance of the quality attributes of the 
active substance during long-term study, with no protein precipitation or adsorption observed. 
Performance of the container was tested and found to be reproducible. 
The container closure system for benralizumab active substance storage and transport has been 
adequately addressed. 
Stability 
Long term stability data for benralizumab active substance have been provided for primary batches and 
for commitment/validation batches. These data together with data from studies at accelerated and stress 
conditions support the claimed shelf-life. The stability data obtained indicate that the active substance is 
stable in the proposed commercial container closure system at least up to the period and under conditions 
tested and that batches obtained from the two manufacturing processes are comparable in respect to 
stability features.  
The proposed active substance shelf life is considered acceptable. 
An acceptable Post-Approval stability protocol has been presented. The ongoing long-term stability 
studies of benralizumab active substance primary and commitment batches will be completed according 
to the stability protocol. The annual post-approval stability commitment is adequate 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development  
Description of the product 
Fasenra is a sterile clear and colourless aqueous solution for subcutaneous administration with 1ml of the 
30mg/ml solution presented in a pre-filled syringe, termed as an accessorised pre-filled syringe (AFPS), 
which consists of a prefilled syringe (PFS) with a staked 29 gauge ½ inch stainless steel needle, needle

shield and elastomeric plunger stopper fitted with a needle safety shield, extended finger flange and 
plunger rod.  
The finished product contains 30 mg/mL benralizumab in histidine/histidine-HCl, trehalose dihydrate, 
polysorbate 20 and water for injections.  
Fasenra is to be administered by healthcare practitioners (HCP) only in accordance with the Instructions 
For Use (IFU). The device forms a single integral product with the medicinal product, is not reusable and 
is discarded immediately after use. The Applicant confirms that the APFS conforms to applicable essential 
requirements on safety, performance and labelling as outlined in Annex I of the Medical Device Directive 
93/42/EEC (MDD). A fully annotated essential requirements checklist is provided to demonstrate 
compliance with relevant standards and the directive which is supported with further appropriately 
detailed information.   
Pharmaceutical development 
Adequate details of the development of the finished product through the clinical and commercial 
development have been provided. Much of the development information provided also reflects and 
supports the approach to finished product development, manufacture and control. Manufacturing process 
characterisation also evaluated potential environmental impacts to product quality such as room 
temperature, light exposure and exposure to vaporised hydrogen peroxide (VHP) used to decontaminate 
the filling isolator. A risk assessment with respect leachable substances during product manufacture from 
formulation of final bulk to fill finish is accepted. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process of the finished product intended for commercial supply begins with thawing 
the active substance followed by final formulation, mixing, filtration and filling into ready to fill primary 
containers. The primary containers are accessorized, labelled and packaged as the finished product. 
A process flow diagram summarizing the manufacturing process, as well as the material inputs, critical 
and non-critical process parameters, and process outputs (in-process controls, microbial controls, and 
performance attributes) has been provided. The process control strategy has been adequately described 
and accepted.  
Process validation 
The full scale manufacturing process is considered to have been validated by process performance and 
qualification batches (PPQ) to demonstrate process control and repeatability.  
Validated reprocessing is described for the final bulk filtration for cases of technical failure only. It is 
proposed that reprocessing will also be validated at commercial scale in future studies according to the 
validation protocol provided and this is accepted. 
The validation of the sterilising filters is accepted. The shipping validation included a report for shipping 
formulated bulk and shipping of finished assembled product. 
Product specification 
The specifications set for the release and stability of benralizumab finished product have been set taking 
ICH Q6B guideline into account: published limits, stability limits approach and non-stability limits 
Assessment report  
EMA/780390/2017

approach. Specifications for historical finished product batches were also provided. The specifications for 
Farensa finished product was developed using the same control strategy as that used for active 
substance, based on a product quality attribute risk assessment.  
Fasenra finished product is tested using a combination of compendial and non-compendial methods. The 
analytical procedures applied for the control of final bulk and finished product are the ones used for the 
control of active substance complemented with some additional analytical procedures. 
For compendial test methods, relevant pharmacopoeial references are given and for non-compendial test 
methods, descriptions of the assay procedures are provided. Verification of the suitability of the 
compendial methods for benralizumab active substance/ finished product have been provided.  
Validation of non-compendial methods has been conducted using pre-approved validation protocols 
designed in accordance with the principle of ICH Q2(R1) Validation of Analytical Procedures. The 
validation reports on the methods applied on the control of active substance are also applicable to the 
same tests used for the control of the finished product. The validation/qualification results for both 
compendial and non-compendial assays are provided indicating that the assays are suitable for the 
intended use. The validation of non-compendial methods was adequately performed. 
Batch analysis 
The batch analyses provided indicate that all batches complied with the specifications in place at the time 
of their release. The acceptance criteria for release and stability of the finished product are in general 
acceptable. The product and process-related impurities identified in Farensa finished product include the 
same species as those identified in the active substance.  
Container closure system 
The Farensa finished product is commercialized in an accessorized prefilled syringe intended for 
subcutaneous administration. The various components of the APFS have been sufficiently described: 
syringe barrel and plunger stopper. 
Stability of the product 
The proposed finished product shelf life when packaged in the proposed container closure system and 
stored at the long-term storage condition of 2-8°C of 36 months is supported.  
Photostability testing established the protective nature of the secondary packaging. The device 
functionality over the proposed shelf life has been satisfactorily established. 
Comparability exercise for Finished Medicinal Drug Product 
Changes between products manufactured by process 2 and process 3 have been sufficiently described 
and have been supported with comparability data. There were no changes between pivotal phase product 
and proposed commercial product, including the APFS presentation. Comparability between process 3 
clinical and process 3 commercial products has been established.  
Adventitious agents 
Assessment report

The control of mycoplasma and microbial contamination has been adequately addressed. 
The control of entry of adventitious virus into the process has been adequately addressed throughout the 
dossier. Cumulative viral clearance is achieved through viral inactivation (low pH treatment), physical 
removal of virus by nanofiltration and three chromatographic steps. The low pH inactivation and virus 
removal filtration are two dedicated viral clearance steps. Individual reports for each evaluation have 
been provided. The conduct and evaluation of the studies are agreed as being valid. The performance of 
chromatography models used during development and viral validation have been additionally qualified 
based on chromatogram characteristics and step yield when running process stream spiked with model 
virus. The conclusion that the proposed resin re-use cycles have no impact on viral clearance is 
supported. Virus carryover experiments were also performed to determine the effectiveness of column 
sanitization which were found to be supportive of the sanitisation process of each column. The viral safety 
factor of benralizumab was adequately assessed. 
TSE infectivity control has been managed by excluding animal derived raw materials from the production 
process and the cell bank (MCB and WCB) preparation. A risk assessment in accordance with 
EMEA/410/01, current revision has been adequately summarized. The conclusions that the bovine 
sourced materials used during establishment of the MCB pose a low potential risk of BSE are accepted. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The information provided by the Applicant is a comprehensive and coherent data package supporting this 
marketing authorisation application (MAA). Relevant guidelines and monographs have been taken into 
account. The results indicate that benralizumab as well as the finished product can be reproducibly 
manufactured.  
The stability program is in general considered satisfactory. The results generated during the stability 
studies support the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as defined in the SmPC. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The systematic development of the active substance and the finished product has been well presented 
and effectively communicated in the quality dossier. The active substance manufacturing process has 
been well defined. The same applies for the finished product and the information in the dossier adequately 
supports the finished product development.  
2.4.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommended an additional point for further investigation.

2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
IL-5 is a cytokine that drives growth, differentiation, recruitment and activation of eosinophils and in 
patients with eosinophilic asthma, eosinophils in lung tissue are an important part of the immune 
response: this cell population may have a specific role in combating respiratory viral infections.  Inhibiting 
IL-5 could reduce the occurrence of asthma exacerbations.   
In vitro pharmacology studies showed that benralizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody, bound with 
high affinity to human and cynomolgus monkey IL-5Rα receptors, but not to murine IL-5Rα receptors.  
Benralizumab blocked activation through the IL-5 receptor, located on eosinophils, resulting in a 
reduction of the signal to drive eosinophil growth and differentiation, recruitment and activation.  Testing 
for activity at rat IL- 5Rα receptors was not conducted but the rat IL-5Rα receptor gene has ~90% 
nucleotide identity with the mouse sequence and ~85% identify at the protein level: benralizumab is 
concluded not to be active at mouse or rat IL-5 receptors.  Despite an apparent 2.6-fold difference in 
binding affinity (42 and 16 pM KD for monkey and human receptors, respectively), there was essentially 
no quantitative difference in the EC50s for binding to monkey and human eosinophils (40 and 36 pM). 
The murine progenitor of benralizumab, KM1259, shares the epitope specificity for hIL-5α receptors with 
benralizumab and was shown to inhibit binding of IL-5 to IL-5α receptors; benralizumab inhibited 
IL-5-dependent cell proliferation.  The Applicant was asked to provide more information on the 
physicochemical characteristics of benralizumab and its derivatives used in the pharmacology studies.  
The Applicant provided some additional details including results of testing for appearance, monomer 
content (by size exclusion chromatography), pH, osmolarity and oligosaccharide profiling.  However, no 
information was present for fucosylated parent anti-IL-5Rα mAb (KM8400) and physicochemical 
characterisation was either not done or was not archived.  This was accepted. 
In testing of binding of benralizumab to eosinophils, some variability in response was seen: testing of 
samples from 3 humans and 3 monkeys, binding to eosinophils could not be shown in 1 monkey.  This 
variability was not explained and the Applicant was requested to clarify this result and discuss possible 
clinical implications.  The Applicant’s response noted that the reasons for not binding to eosinophils in one 
cynomolgus monkey blood sample of the 3 donors evaluated are not known: in humans, polymorphisms 
of IL-5Rα are known but these do not affect binding of IL-5 to IL5Rα but comparable data about 
polymorphisms in monkey IL-5Rα are not available.  Other explanations could be assay variability, low 
IL-5Rα numbers on the eosinophils in this monkey or some technical failure in the assay: none of these 
are known to be true. 
IL-5 receptors are also notably present on basophils, which are also are likely to be targeted by 
benralizumab.  However, benralizumab did not bind to lymphocytes, monocytes or neutrophils. 
Benralizumab acts to deplete eosinophils by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).  With 
this action, sufficiently high doses of benralizumab should cause detectable decreases in eosinophil count 
and even lead to elimination of eosinophils.  However, induction of eosinophil apoptosis by ADCC in in 
vitro testing did not result in eosinophil degranulation.  In terms of Fc-mediated functions, the Applicant 
presented data from a publication (Kolbeck et al 2010) in which the afucosylation step was shown to 
increase potency for binding to FcγRIIIa from both humans and monkeys, supporting the decision to 
develop the defucosylated antibody, as this in vitro testing suggests it should be more effective at 
Assessment report  
EMA/780390/2017  
Page 18/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
inducing eosinophil depletion in vivo.  The Applicant was requested to provide the study report relating to 
this work but responded that there was no such report and all information that was available on 
methodology applied to Fcγ receptor binding, ADCC and CDC was contained in the publication. 
In in vivo pharmacology studies, benralizumab, when given to naive or allergen-challenged cynomolgus 
monkeys, demonstrated rapid and pronounced reduction of eosinophils in blood, bone marrow and 
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, demonstrating its pharmacological activity in vivo in this species.  However, 
like results with eosinophil binding, there were some indications that some individuals did not show this 
profile.  The reasons for these instances of difference are not understood.  However, the results suggest 
that the hypothesis, that reducing eosinophilic cell infiltration in the lungs could improve lung function in 
an asthma challenge, was supported sufficiently to support clinical testing in patients with asthma. 
Secondary pharmacodynamics and pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were not conducted. 
Safety pharmacology endpoints were included in GLP toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys, so 
minimising use of non-human primates.  These studies included assessment of potential effect of 
benralizumab on cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous systems, following single and repeated 
subcutaneous and intravenous doses, up to 30 mg/kg.  There was no indication of toxicity in these 
evaluations. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Validation studies showed that assays to quantify benralizumab and antibody to benralizumab in 
cynomolgus monkey serum were suitable for use.  Reporting of the stability samples for antibody to 
benralizumab was incomplete but results suggested that immunogenic reactions occurred only in a 
minority of monkeys: no objection was raised in respect of these results. 
The Applicant assessed kinetics of benralizumab in five toxicity studies of up to 9 months’ dosing duration 
in cynomolgus monkeys dosed either by intravenous or subcutaneous injection at doses up to 30 mg/kg 
and in pregnant monkeys and offspring in a developmental toxicity study.  The product is intended for 
subcutaneous use by patients and in monkeys bioavailability by this route was ~60% with Tmax seeming 
to be longer at higher doses but within 3 days at lower doses, i.e. doses closer to the intended human 
dose.  Across studies, exposure was dose-proportional over the range 1-30 mg/kg with no gender 
difference noted; kinetic results were typical of an IgG1 antibody without an antigen sink.  Mean clearance 
values ranged from 3.6 to 8.4 mL/kg/day and mean terminal elimination half-lives ranged from 7.8 to 
20.4 days.  In pregnant monkeys, there was evidence of placental and/or milk transfer as infants showed 
detectable benralizumab concentrations despite not being dosed directly.  Excretion of benralizumab in 
the maternal milk was not investigated directly, however, although it may be assumed that benralizumab 
will behave similarly to other IgG1 antibodies; the lack of such data is accepted.  Immunogenic reactions 
were seen in a minority of monkeys and correlated with accelerated clearance of, and reduced exposure 
to, benralizumab.  
These studies suffice to show that there was systemic exposure to benralizumab in the nonclinical safety 
studies. 
2.5.3.  Toxicology 
Single and repeated dose general toxicity studies were completed in cynomolgus monkeys with dosing for 
up to 9 months, every 2 weeks, with use of subcutaneous and intravenous routes.  A pre- and post-natal 
developmental toxicity study was also completed in pregnant and neonatal cynomolgus monkeys.  No 
genotoxicity or carcinogenicity studies were done.  Tissue cross-reactivity studies were completed.   
Assessment report  
EMA/780390/2017  
Page 19/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Single dose toxicity 
In the in vivo toxicity studies, the Applicant selected doses progressively i.e. doses for later studies were 
selected based on results from earlier studies and the doses selected are accepted as suitable.  In the 
pharmacology file, plasma concentrations up to ~10 μg/ml were considered appropriate for the primary 
activity of the drug to impede infiltration of eosinophils into the airways following an antigenic challenge, 
and in the toxicity studies, the typical Cmax plasma concentrations were up to ~850 μg/ml at the top 
doses used. 
Single dose toxicity studies were limited to a non-GLP study in three monkeys only with no control group 
or terminal necropsy: the primary objective was to evaluate toxicokinetics and immunogenicity of 
benralizumab.  The study has some insufficiencies which hinder interpretation of observed findings of 
haematuria and proteinuria, in addition to reduction of eosinophil counts, but as there are data from 
repeat dose GLP compliant studies, this is accepted. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Three repeat dose general toxicity studies were completed, all with inclusion of a recovery period.  In the 
first, benralizumab was given by bolus intravenous injection every 3 weeks at doses of 0.1, 1.0, 10, and 
30 mg/kg over 9 weeks; in the second, it was given by subcutaneous injection every 2 weeks at 1, 10 and 
30 mg/kg over 15 weeks and in the third, every 2 weeks at 10 or 25 mg/kg intravenously or subcutaneous 
over 39 weeks.  These studies included specific safety pharmacology, immunotoxicity (lymphocyte 
immunophenotyping) and fertility endpoints (including hormone analyses).  Testing for development of 
anti-benralizumab antibodies was also completed and this was seen in 2 of 24 (8.3%), 9 of 36 (25%) and 
2 of 36 (5.5%) of monkeys given benralizumab in the 9-, 15- and 39-week studies, respectively.   
Benralizumab was not associated with major toxicity.  Reduction or depletion of eosinophils was noted 
and is the intended therapeutic action of the drug.  The magnitude of this effect varied across the three 
studies: nearly full depletion of peripheral and bone marrow eosinophils was still observed after the 
recovery period (18 days), in the 9-week study; partially reversibility of the reduction in eosinophils was 
noted in the 39-week study (the recovery period was 12 weeks); but there was apparently, little or no 
reduction in the 15-week study.  The Applicant was asked to detail the time course of eosinophil counts in 
order to determine if there was a rebound effect on eosinophil counts on withdrawal of benralizumab, 
noting the period of time needed to elapse for total clearance of the drug after its last dose.  Data are only 
available from a small number of monkeys However, were this effect to happen in patients, it might pose 
a real risk of asthma exacerbation with potentially severe, including fatal, events; as these relate to loss 
of the drug in plasma occurring weeks, or months, after the last dose, it may not be recognised as a 
drug-related event in clinical use.  In its analysis, the Applicant presented a summary of the results on 
recovery eosinophil counts in monkeys in toxicity studies where such data are available and to evaluate 
whether these data substantiate the concern raised.  The Applicant argued that considering results from 
all available monkeys, there did not appear to be a rebound effect for blood absolute eosinophil values 
and the majority of monkeys had absolute blood eosinophil values comparable to or lower than baseline 
at the last timepoint assessed after benralizumab dosing was stopped.  In some monkeys with antibodies 
to benralizumab, blood eosinophils increased later in the study compared to baseline, but it was also the 
case that some monkeys without detectable anti-benralizumab antibodies showed an increasing trend for 
blood eosinophils throughout the study during the dosing and recovery phases.  It is also relevant to 
consider the normal range of eosinophils in cynomolgus monkeys: historical control values from one of 
the testing facilities showed absolute blood eosinophils in Chinese cynomolgus monkeys in the range

20-390 /µl, with a median of 40/μl and this is generally consistent with other published data.  Thus, there 
is a 20-fold range of what might considered normal.  This issue was considered resolved. 
Other noteworthy findings in the toxicity studies included transient reduction in neutrophil counts 
(9-week study, 2 females in the 30 mg/kg dose group), gastrointestinal acute inflammation and/or 
haemorrhage (15-week study, 1 female at 10 mg/kg and 1 male and 2 females at 1 mg/kg), right wrist 
anomaly (dislocated radial-carpal joint with associated torn ligaments) (39-week study, 1 male at 25 
mg/kg intravenously), transient signs of bruising / reddened areas around the eyes, on the face, chest 
and lower abdomen (petechiae and ecchymosis), decreased platelet count and indicators of circulating 
erythrocyte mass (39-week study, 1 female at 25 mg/kg intravenously) and minimal-to-mild necrosis of 
papillary muscle (39-week study, 1 male in each group given benralizumab), with 1 of the 3 males (25 
mg/kg, intravenously) also with mild interstitial fibrosis.  The Applicant judged that except for the 
reduction in neutrophils counts, all these were considered to be not related or unlikely related to 
benralizumab and, therefore, set the NOAEL at the highest tested doses for the 15- and 39-week studies 
and at equal or lower than the highest tested dose for the 9-week study.  Reductions in the neutrophil 
counts were transient, and only observed in the group with the highest systemic exposure to 
benralizumab, across the three studies, and benralizumab was not found to bind to neutrophils.  
Therefore, based on non-clinical data, reductions in neutrophil counts would seem to be of limited clinical 
concern as this can also be monitored clinically in patients if needed. 
The gastrointestinal findings were not related to benralizumab by the Applicant due to the acute nature of 
the finding and as it was not seen in prior toxicity studies and was not apparently dose-related.  Its 
occurrence in the 15-week study could be viewed as following an inverse dose/effect relationship (3, 1 
and 0 monkeys at 1, 10 and 30 mg/kg, respectively); systemic exposure at the low dose was the closest 
to the systemic exposure expected in humans, although was still somewhat higher.  The Applicant was 
asked to provide further interpretation of the gastrointestinal acute inflammation / haemorrhage.  The 
Applicant’s opinion is that the findings are considered as not related to benralizumab based on their low 
incidence, acute nature, lack of evidence of such finding in other studies, lack of clear dose response and 
results of tissue cross-reactivity studies, which, in what concerns gastrointestinal tissues, have only 
revealed staining of intravascular proteins.  There is also no clinical signal for specific concern.  This was 
accepted by CHMP concluding   that the weight of evidence does not indicate a risk of gastrointestinal 
inflammation/haemorrhage 
Although there was no evidence of cardiotoxicity in the in-life stages of the general toxicity studies, in 
tissue cross reactivity studies, binding to cardiac myocytes was noted in monkeys but not in humans; 
however, this binding was cytoplasmic and thus judged not likely to be of in vivo relevance.  In study 
AA00095 but not in the other general toxicity studies, there were instances of papillary muscle necrosis 
seen at post mortem in monkeys.  The Applicant considered these were unrelated to benralizumab but 
was asked to justify this view further as there was little support from the literature that papillary muscle 
necrosis is a common background finding.  The Applicant argues that papillary muscle necrosis showed 
limited incidence, did not occur in females, and showed no dose-response, and fibrosis was present in a 
control animal at recovery. Furthermore, the published evidence could support these changes as being 
regarded as spontaneous background lesions in this species.  The Applicant’s arguments were accepted 
by CHMP leading to the conclusion that no corroboration of a causal role for benralizumab can be 
identified at present..   
Repro-toxicity studies 
Potential adverse effects on fertility were assessed through inclusion of specific fertility endpoints 
(menstrual cycle lengths, testicular volume/size, sperm analysis for sperm count, morphology and 
motility and analysis of reproductive hormones), in addition to the reproductive organ weights and 
Assessment report

histopathology analysis at necropsy, in the 39-week repeat dose toxicity study, in which all monkeys were 
sexually mature.  In these assessments, fertility was not affected by benralizumab.  This approach to 
evaluation of effects on fertility, embryofetal and pre- and post-natal development is accepted and 
supported by the recommendations in the ICH S6 (R1) guideline.  However the SmPC, clearly mentions 
that no animal studies dedicated to investigating effects on fertility have been conducted. 
In pregnant monkeys, there was no effect of benralizumab on pregnancy viability or on infant 
development: in the study, it was given by intravenous injection at doses up to 30 mg/kg every other 
week from gestation day 20/22 to one month post-partum.  Embryofetal development was monitored by 
ultrasound examinations and gestational length; neonates/infants were evaluated up to reaching 6.5 
months of age and, among other aspects, were also examined for effects of benralizumab on T-cell 
dependent antibody responses.  Benralizumab-related findings were limited to a reduction / depletion of 
eosinophils in the maternal animals and neonates / infants and the occurrence of anti-benralizumab 
antibodies in some dams (1 out of 14 (7%) and 2 out of 19 (11%) at 10 and 30 mg/kg, respectively); as 
such, the NOAEL was set at the highest tested dose (corresponding to maternal systemic exposures over 
200-times higher than the human exposure, and also to neonate / infant mean plasma concentrations 
higher than the human plasma Cmax).  Considering that depletion of eosinophils in neonates/infants is 
not an intended effect and may be considered as adverse for the progeny, this is to be included in the 
SmPC section 5.3, Preclinical safety data, under the heading ‘as follows : In the offspring of monkeys 
dosed while pregnant, there was a reduction in eosinophils’.  There was also an apparent increased 
incidence of third trimester fetal losses in the benrazilumab-treated groups.  This was attributed by the 
Applicant to 3 cases (1 and 2 at 10 and 30 mg/kg, respectively) of complications associated with 
parturition (breech presentation) and, also considering the lack of developmental abnormalities in any 
fetuses and no known pharmacological effect of benralizumab capable of explaining a specific causality of 
third trimester fetal loss, considered as not related to benralizumab treatment.  The Applicant’s 
explanation and conclusion are accepted by CHMP, also considering the lack of effects on parturition for 
approved medicinal products which target IL-5.   
The lack of studies with dosing of juvenile animals is also accepted, considering that the medicine is 
intended for adults, the lack of non-clinical studies in the agreed paediatric investigation plan, and the 
results from the enhanced pre- and post-natal development study.   
Genotoxicity 
Genotoxicity studies are not required for this product.  
Carcinogenicity 
The Applicant’s approach to assessing the risk of carcinogenicity with benralizumab was to consider the 
options for experimentation that might be open to the Applicant: these were not considered suitable or 
were judged likely to be misleading.  The Applicant noted that available evidence with benralizumab from 
studies in monkeys indicated no specific concern for induction of cancer and considered that further 
experimental studies with benralizumab would not be useful indicators of clinical risk.  The Applicant’s 
arguments to justify limitations on testing methodology are generally agreed. They are detailed below : 
Blockade of the cytokine IL-5Rα, as opposed to the receptor, by other antibodies does not lead to total 
loss of eosinophils indicating that other factors, possibly IL-3 and/or GMCSF, can suffice to perpetuate the 
cell population, despite that IL-5 is a growth factor for these cells.  In this regard, the additional action of 
benralizumab to deplete eosinophils by ADCC may pose additional risks than a purely IL-5 blocking

antibody.  As a consequence, negative results from studies addressing the risk of carcinogenicity with IL-5 
blockade might not reflect the profile of benralizumab.  A reduction of eosinophils is anticipated with use 
of benralizumab and in experimental work in mice, elimination of eosinophils was suggested to increase 
risk of cancer (Simson et al 2007).  In brief, this work suggested eosinophils could play a role in limiting 
risk of developing cancer following injection of a known carcinogen (methylchloroanthrene).  This may not 
be of direct relevance to assessing human risk with benralizumab as the method used injection of a potent 
carcinogen and the mode of action of eosinophils may be related to the ability to contribute to formation 
of a capsule round the tumour; nevertheless, the absence of a mention of this by the Applicant suggests 
it has not shown sufficient consideration of the literature describing some association of IL-5 inhibition / 
eosinophil depletion with a reduction in tumour risk. 
In CHMP scientific advice in 2009, the Applicant’s position supporting its lack of experimental studies was 
endorsed but the Applicant was advised to ‘pay some attention, not only to the outcome of the chronic 
study in monkeys, but also to a thorough evaluation of the available information regarding the role of IL-5 
in processes that may impact on cellular (in)stability, e.g. cellular division processes, cellular 
communication, apoptosis, as well as any impact on the immune function.’  The Applicant was asked to 
provide further consideration of whether any experimental work could be done that could shed more light 
on the risk of cancer, particularly in relation to depletion of eosinophils.  There are published data to the 
effect that eosinophils can have protective effects against tumours, but there are much conflicting data.  
The matter is not entirely resolved, but the experimental data are difficult to extrapolate to predicting a 
relevant clinical risk and the conclusion was made that there is insufficient evidence that benralizumab, by 
depleting eosinophils, poses a risk of cancer: considering this, its risk/benefit balance was judged 
favourable. 
Local Tolerance  
When given as a single subcutaneous injection, benralizumab caused no adverse findings and no 
histological lesions of toxicological significance were noted at the injection sites for up to 14 days after 
dosing.  There are no local tolerance concerns.  In the general toxicity studies, there was no evidence of 
toxicity to the immune system. 
2.5.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Benralizumab is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter the concentration or distribution of the 
substance in the environment.  Reference is made to guidance on the environmental risk assessment of 
medicinal products for human use (CHMP/SWP/4447/00) which specifically exempts proteins from the 
need for an assessment of potential risk to the environment. Therefore, benralizumab is not expected to 
pose a risk to the environment. 
2.5.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical development of benralizumab is -overall acceptable.  Benralizumab presented 
pharmacological properties suggesting the potential to deplete tissue eosinophils so leading to a 
beneficial effect in patients with eosinophilic asthma.  In the pharmacology studies, the Applicant 
responded adequately to a question to the effect that some monkeys did not show binding of 
benralizumab to eosinophils.  The Applicant was unable to provide much further data than was published 
or supplied in the initial dossier into physicochemical characteristics of test materials used, and Fcγ 
recreptor binding, ADCC and CDC methods but the dossier was finally accepted with these limitations.   
Assessment report

After review of the kinetic section of this dossier, there were no concerns raised.  
The Applicant conducted safety studies that should suffice to characterise toxicity of benralizumab: 
studies were in a suitable species, cynomolgus monkeys, of sufficient duration, and used sufficient doses 
and were of suitable designs.  No major toxicity occurred.  The Applicant was asked to provide further 
comments on a number of issues.  In relation to an apparent lack of depletion of eosinophils in a 15-week 
general toxicity study, the Applicant showed that mean eosinophil values were skewed by large values in 
individual monkeys and consideration of the mean value could fail to show the full picture.  There was high 
baseline variability - this (i.e. mean baseline eosinophil counts) varied by up to 28-fold.  Given this 
variability, the Applicant’s explanation was considered acceptable.  There was however insufficient 
evidence to associate benralizumab with certain findings in the toxicity studies: the Applicant was asked 
to provide further comment on whether gastrointestinal haemorrhage / inflammation was a suggested 
toxicity.  On consideration, the evidence was judged not to support a causal role for benralizumab and the 
issue considered solved.  The Applicant was also asked to comment on whether there was evidence that 
longer exposure to benralizumab could have caused papillary muscle necrosis.  Its occurrence in 3 males 
in the longer term general toxicity study in monkeys may be a potential signal but one for which no 
corroboration of a causal role for benralizumab can be identified at present..  
No dedicated fertility studies have been conducted however assessment of specific fertility endpoints 
(menstrual cycle lengths, testicular volume/size, sperm analysis for sperm count, morphology and 
motility and analysis of reproductive hormones), in addition to the reproductive organ weights and 
histopathology analysis at necropsy, were carried out in the 39-week repeat dose toxicity study, in which 
all monkeys were sexually mature.   A statement related to the reduction of eosinophils in the offspring of 
monkeys dosed while pregnant, is introduced on the SmPC section 5.3. 
The Applicant was also asked to comment on the risk of rebound eosinophilia on stopping benralizumab.  
The majority of animals had absolute blood eosinophil values comparable to or lower than baseline at the 
last timepoint assessed after benralizumab dosing was stopped and the evidence available did not 
substantiate the concern raised.  There was no relevant signal in the clinical data and this point was 
considered resolved.  
The Applicant was also asked to address whether this drug could, by depleting eosinophils, pose an undue 
risk of cancer.  The response was considered acceptable and the conclusion was that there is no evidence 
that use of benralizumab would pose an increased risk of cancer in patients and that the product’s 
risk/benefit profile was positive. 
2.5.6.  Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
No major objections were identified and the concerns raised by CHMP have either been addressed or the 
limited information acknowledged and accepted by the CHMP following applicant justification.  Therefore, 
there are no remaining objections to grant of a marketing authorisation can be granted and there are no 
further issues to be resolved were approval to be granted.

2.6.  Clinical aspects 
2.6.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
A GCP inspection was conducted in May-June 2017 for the following clinical study D3250C00018 
(CALIMA) centre study numbers: 206 (in Argentina) and 5501 (in Philippines) as well as the Sponsor in 
the US. At the clinical sites, there were a few major and minor findings. At the Sponsor’s site, there were 
one critical finding and three major findings. 
Regarding the quality of the data, ethical conduct and GCP compliance, the inspectors considered that in 
general most of the findings detected can be considered process related, mainly as a consequence of the 
suboptimal trial management and oversight by the Sponsor on the delegated tasks. Data collected at sites 
inspected are considered of an acceptable quality and inspectors considered that the trial had been 
conducted following ethical standards and GCP and that the deficiencies detected have no impact on the 
inspected trials’ data reliability and validity.

2.6.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
All studies presented have been performed in patient populations; there are no studies in healthy 
subjects. 
The bioanalytical methods for benralizumab are adequately validated and are suitable for their purposes. 
Assay performance, in terms of inter-assay precision and inter-assay relative error was considered 
acceptable. An ELISA assay has been used for study MI-CP158 (LLOQ of 10 ng/mL) and an ECL 
immunoassay on the Meso Scale Discovery platform has been used for the other studies (LLOQ of 3.86 
ng/mL). 
Assessment report  
EMA/780390/2017  
Page 29/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A 3-tiered testing approach including screening, confirmation and titre assay was used for the assessment 
of anti-drug antibody (ADA) responses to benralizumab in clinical studies. Confirmed ADA-positive 
samples were subsequently tested for in vitro neutralising activity. Two neutralisation assays were 
developed, a ligand-binding assay and a cell-based assay. The LBA was showed to be more sensitive than 
the CBA and was selected for the Phase III studies. In general, the bioanalytical methods have been 
adequately validated and selectivity was evaluated in individual serum samples from asthma and COPD 
patients. Assay performance, in terms of accuracy and precision are considered acceptable. 
A population PK model was developed using FOCE with interaction estimation method using NONMEM 
software. The model was assessed using GOF plots, VPCs and validated using an external validation 
dataset. The population PK objectives were clear with appropriate description of the nature of the data to 
be analysed. The general modelling aspects including software, estimation methods and diagnostics were 
properly reported. Also, data from the ZONDA clinical trial were used as an external validation dataset. 
Details for data simulations based on the model were also given. 
The statistical methods used are appropriate for summarising the PK data. 
Absorption 
The slow absorption of benralizumab (3.59 days) is consistent with the reported slow absorption of other 
monoclonal antibodies (2-8 days). The population PK estimation of benralizumab bioavailability of 57.9% 
was associated with moderate degree of inter-individual variability (29.1 CV%). However, the anatomical 
site effects (upper abdomen and thigh vs upper arm) were not included in the population PK model as the 
fractional effect estimates for anatomical injection site on bioavailability relative to administration to the 
upper arm (~1.09) were considered not clinically relevant. 
For the IV route, benralizumab was administered in a dose range from 0.03 to 3 mg/kg leading to a 
plasma Cmax range of 0.983 to 82.2 µg/mL. For the SC route, benralizumab was administered in a dose 
range of 25-200 mg/injection leading to a plasma Cmax range of 1.152 to 15.637 µg/mL. 
Clinical studies were not conducted to evaluate the bioequivalence of benralizumab formulations. In vitro 
comparability studies were conducted to evaluate formulation changes. 
Distribution 
Binding of monoclonal antibodies is generally low, so protein binding studies are not required. 
Immunoglobulins are expected to partition in plasma, so blood to plasma partitioning studies are not 
required. 
The combined central and peripheral volumes of distribution for benralizumab is 5.68 L (3.23 L Vc + 2.45 
L Vp), indicating limited extracellular distribution which is expected for all therapeutic IgG due to their 
large size and hydrophilic nature. 
Elimination 
Population PK for benralizumab estimated clearance to be at 0.29 L/day. Clearance was shown to increase 
with body weight, which is expected for an antibody. Also, the presence of ADAs increased benralizumab 
clearance by 121%. 
No clinical studies have been performed to characterise benralizumab excretion. Benralizumab is an 
antibody which is broken down by proteolytic enzymes to amino acid and peptides which either excreted 
by kidney or re-used in protein synthesis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/780390/2017  
Page 30/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No studies have been performed to characterise benralizumab metabolism. IgGs are in general 
metabolised by proteolytic enzymes expressed in various tissues and in plasma, target-mediated 
elimination and nonspecific endocytosis. 
No data are provided by the Applicant on possible active or inactive metabolites. Main IgG metabolites are 
expected to be amino acids and peptides. The function of these peptides has not been studied. 
No data have been provided by the Applicant on the possible genetic polymorphisms which can affect 
benralizumab metabolism. Investigation is not considered necessary. 
Dose proportionality and time dependency 
The dose proportionality was investigated after IV single dose benralizumab therapy in patients with 
asthma. The AUC and Cmax increase appeared to be proportional or less than proportional over an IV 
dose range of 0.03 to 3.0 mg/kg; however no statistical test has been used to assess dose proportionality. 
Clearance of benralizumab appeared independent of the administered dose. Linear PKs and absence of 
target saturation or target-mediated clearance were confirmed using a population PK modelling 
approach. 
Data suggest that consistent benralizumab plasma concentrations are attained following multiple dosing, 
indicative of no time-dependency in the absence of ADA. However, the Applicant did not provide any 
information on accumulation ratio for benralizumab. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Moderate inter-individual variability in clearance and bioavailability was observed using population PK 
model (21.3 and 29.1% CV, respectively). Minimal inter-occasion variability of 5.1% CV was estimated 
upon addition of SIROCCO clinical trial to the base population PK model. 
Moderate degree of inter-individual variability was also observed in the estimated volumes of distribution 
(26.9% for Vc and 47.1% for Vp). 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
A population PK model based on 9 clinical studies (4 phase III clinical studies and 5 early stage clinical 
studies) was developed for benralizumab, which was best described with a 2-compartment model with 
first-order absorption from the SC dosing site and first-order elimination from the central compartment. 
Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
Using the population pharmacokinetic model, the Applicant has shown that renal impairment (primarily 
mild and moderate) is not a significant covariate on benralizumab clearance compared with asthmatic 
patients with normal renal function. However, benralizumab pharmacokinetics was not studied in patients 
with end stage renal disease except for one patient only with severe renal impairment. 
Impaired hepatic function 
Using base population pharmacokinetic model, hepatic function (as assessed by ALT, AST and TBL) did 
not impact benralizumab clearance. Separate ad hoc models confirmed no observable clinically significant 
impact of hepatic function on benralizumab clearance. 
Gender and race 
Population pharmacokinetic showed that neither gender nor race had a clinically significant impact on 
benralizumab clearance. 
Assessment report  
EMA/780390/2017  
Page 31/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Weight 
Using population pharmacokinetic model, body weight had exponential effect on benralizumab clearance 
(a power parameter estimate of 0.831) and on benralizumab central volume of distribution (a power 
parameter estimate of 0.815 for V2 and 0.563 for V3). A simulation for the effect of body weight on 
benralizumab serum concentrations based on 5000 patients randomly sampled showed that the median 
steady-state exposure in patients within the ≥95th percentile was lower (44%) compared with that in 
patients within the ≤5th percentile. Thus, it was considered unnecessary to adjust dose based on body 
weight. However, the data are limited by the body weight range of the subjects recruited in the clinical 
trials. 
Age 
Benralizumab average concentrations and terminal half-life showed small difference between age groups 
(adolescents, adults and old age groups). Yet, due to high standard deviations, these differences are 
unlikely to be statistically significant. 
No pharmacokinetic data are available for paediatric patients below the age of 12 years. 
Interactions 
Benralizumab clearance is independent of hepatic metabolism and is not subject to protein transporters. 
Therefore, pharmacokinetic interaction studies are not required. 
Using the population pharmacokinetic model, co-administration of oral corticosteroid, montelukast, 
paracetamol, proton pump inhibitors (PPI), macrolides and theophylline/aminophylline did not have an 
impact of benralizumab clearance. Therapeutic antibodies typically do not undergo metabolism or 
transport as clearance pathway. Therefore, they are unlikely to interact with small drug molecules. The 
median of the deviations of the individual estimates from population mean for benralizumab clearance 
(eta clearance) did not appear to differ in presence and absence of co-administered drugs such as 
theophylline and PPIs indicating lack of significant effect on the clearance of benralizumab.  
2.6.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Benralizumab binds to IL-5Rα with high affinity on the surface of human eosinophils and basophils. It 
induces eosinophil and basophil apoptosis in the presence of NK cells with no associated increase in the 
concentrations of eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and eosinophilic-derived neurotoxin (EDN), which 
provides evidence that benralizumab does not induce eosinophil activation or necrosis. Absence of the 
monosaccharide fucose on the oligosaccharide core of human IgG1 has previously been shown to result 
in enhanced binding affinity to FcγRIIIa and subsequently enhanced ADCC activity. Benralizumab 
depletes eosinophils by inducing apoptosis via enhanced ADCC. 
Primary pharmacology 
Treatment with benralizumab resulted in the rapid, near complete depletion (typically ≥95%) of blood 
eosinophils within 24 hours post-dosing and depletion of eosinophils in other key tissue compartments 
where eosinophils contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma (sputum, lung tissue, and the bone marrow). 
The depletion of eosinophils was accompanied by a reduction in the eosinophilic granule proteins EDN and 
ECP, which supports the notion that benralizumab depletes eosinophils via apoptosis and also suggests 
that benralizumab reduces eosinophilic inflammation. The depletion was reversible, and the majority of 
Assessment report  
EMA/780390/2017  
Page 32/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
eosinophil counts returned to approximately baseline levels within 6 months after cessation of repeated 
SC benralizumab dosing. 
Additionally, benralizumab depleted peripheral blood basophils to a lesser extent than eosinophils. 
Consistent with the mechanism of action, dosing with benralizumab resulted in reduced NK cells following 
the first dose, after which NK cells trended towards baseline levels. No clinically meaningful trends were 
associated with NK cell effects. 
Dosing with benralizumab also resulted in sustained, increased serum levels of IL 5 and eotaxin 1, which 
is consistent with the reduction of eosinophils as these cells are primary targets of IL 5 and eotaxin-1. 
Benralizumab did not, however, influence other asthma associated biomarkers such as exhaled nitric 
oxide or total serum IgE levels, which suggests that these biomarkers are not regulated by eosinophils. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been performed. There are no data to suggest that IL-5Rα 
is expressed on hepatocytes and treatment with benralizumab has no identified effect on other circulating 
cytokines except for IL 5 and the eosinophil chemokines eotaxin-1 and eotaxin-2. From population PK 
analysis, commonly used small molecule drugs (montelukast, paracetamol, proton pump inhibitors, 
macrolides, and theophylline/aminophylline) had no effect on benralizumab clearance. Together, these 
data indicate that the potential risk of interactions between benralizumab and other drugs is low. 
Genetic differences in PD response 
The impact of genetic polymorphisms in IL 5Rα or FcɣRIIIa on the PD response to benralizumab was not 
specifically studied. However, based on literature data, it can be argued that genetic differences in PD 
responses are unlikely to occur with benralizumab. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
The Applicant appropriately described the nature of the data to be analysed. The general modelling 
aspects including software, handling of missing data and covariates are documented. 
The Applicant developed a population approach to characterize the exposure-response relationship in 
phase IIB clinical study. The analysis showed that maximum effect (as judged by asthma exacerbation 
rate (AER) fractional reduction) was achieved at benralizumab plasma trough concentrations > 690 
ng/ml. 90% of the maximum effect was achieved at trough concentrations 200 ng/ml (corresponding to 
30mg Q8W dose). The 30 mg dose maintained interquartile range above ED80. This PK/PD approach for 
dose selection is endorsed as good way for exposure-response analysis. 
The Applicant used empirical PK Quartile correlation method to assess the exposure-response analysis for 
the primary efficacy endpoint (asthma exacerbation rate). Exposure response analysis for the secondary 
efficacy endpoint FEV1 was carried out using an Emax model and empirical assessment. 
The trough PK quartiles showed no apparent relationship with AER in SIROCCO study indicating that an 
efficacy plateau was achieved. The results from CALIMA were inconsistent and higher exposures (Q3 and 
Q4 for of Q4W arm) apparently resulted in a better efficacy. However, pooled data from SIROCCO and 
CALIMA clinical studies are indicative of no exposure-response relationship and that both Q4W and Q8W 
have the same efficacy profile. The proposed dose frequency, i.e. Q4W for the first three doses and Q8W 
thereafter, was selected to achieve rapid airway eosinophil depletion, and thus, hasten the onset of 
treatment benefit, to maintain eosinophil depletion in more patients within the first 8 weeks, and to 
induce high zone tolerance and suppress affinity maturation of ADA, which could lower the incidence and 
affinity of ADA against benralizumab. 
Assessment report  
EMA/780390/2017  
Page 33/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Immunogenicity 
ADA rates were much lower in the Phase III studies than in earlier studies, including at baseline and in the 
placebo arms. The same assay was used and, although not performed in the same laboratory, their 
overall performance specifications were highly comparable. No obvious explanation for this finding was 
provided. Minor modification to the reagents and the test drug would be consistent with the observed 
trend but it remains unclear whether these could explain the magnitude of the reported differences. 
Only the results of the Phase III studies (two exacerbation studies and one OCS reduction study) are 
presented hereafter. Two dosing frequencies were investigated in these studies: 30 mg of benralizumab 
by subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks vs. every 4 weeks for the first 3 doses, then every 8 weeks 
thereafter. 
Baseline ADA rates were approximately 2%. The ADA incidence, defined as the proportion of the study 
population that became newly ADA-positive (seroconverted) or boosted their pre-existing ADA titre 
(increase in titre by greater than 4-fold), ranged from 10 to 14% in the exacerbation studies and was 
slightly lower in the OCS study (7-8%), probably due to OCS immunosuppressant effects. Generally, 
seroconversion occurred early, between 8 and 16 weeks of treatment, and the likelihood of 
seroconversion after long-term exposure (>40 weeks) was low. 
The median titre peaked at 400 at week 24-32 and then remained constant throughout the study. It is 
noteworthy that ADAs were also detected in the placebo arm (incidence of up to 4%) but median titres 
were low (50 to 75). About 30% of the patients had a decrease >75% from their maximum titre (which 
corresponds to a decrease in titre greater than what would be expected from assay variance), suggesting 
that benralizumab may generate a tolerogenic immune response. Very high ADA titres (≥25,600) were 
measured in 8 patients out of more than 1600 patients. 
Most of these ADAs (68-80%) were neutralising and most ADA responses (about 70%) were persistent 
defined as ≥ 2 post-baseline positive samples being separated by a period of ≥16 weeks irrespective of 
any negative samples in between, or being positive at the last post-baseline assessment. Patients with a 
persistent ADA-positive response and patients with nAbs tended to have higher median ADA titres. 
With the lower frequency regimen, the ADA incidence appeared slightly higher with a greater proportion 
of neutralising ADAs compared to the 4-weekly regimen. 
The development of an ADA response during the course of treatment induced lower benralizumab 
Ctrough,ss; their median was below LLOQ with the lower frequency regimen. In parallel, blood 
eosinophils tended to increase, especially with the lower frequency regimen and in the subgroup of 
patients with high ADA titres. Out of the 8 patients with very high ADA titres (≥25,600), which were all 
neutralising, 7 patients had undetectable drug levels in 4 or more of the post-dose measurements and 7 
patients had blood eosinophils returning to approximately equal to or greater than the baseline values at 
one or several assessments. 
Despite clear impact on PK and PD, there was no indication of an effect of ADAs on the efficacy of 
benralizumab (annual asthma exacerbation rate, FEV1, or total asthma symptom score) and on its safety, 
including the occurrence of hypersensitivity reactions. In particular, the 8 patients previously mentioned 
reported 0 or 1 asthma exacerbation over a two-year follow-up. However, complete data  on the impact 
of persistent neutralising ADAs is unknown in the long-term and further data will be provided from the 
extension trials. 
Several findings support that the immunogenic region of benralizumab is its idiotype although the 
afucosylated Fc region might also represent a novel structure to the immune system. There was a good 
correlation between the results of the two different nAb assay formats (LBA and CBA). ADAs were shown 
Assessment report  
EMA/780390/2017  
Page 34/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to inhibit detection of benralizumab in the PK assay (which requires binding of two anti-neutralising 
anti-idiotypic mAbs of different specificities). ADA titres and nAb titres by the LBA were directly 
associated. 
2.6.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of benralizumab in patients with asthma have been described using a population PK 
model. The pharmacokinetics of benralizumab and related covariates have been reasonably well 
described. 
The mechanism of action of benralizumab is well established. By binding to IL-5Rα with high affinity on 
the surface of human eosinophils and basophils, it induces their apoptosis in the presence of NK cells via 
enhanced ADCC. Treatment with benralizumab resulted in the rapid, near complete depletion of blood 
eosinophils within 24 hours post-dosing and depletion of eosinophils in other key tissue compartments 
(sputum, lung tissue, and bone marrow). Additionally, benralizumab depleted peripheral blood basophils 
to a lesser extent than eosinophils. Dosing with benralizumab also resulted in sustained, increased serum 
levels of IL 5 and eotaxin 1, which is consistent with the reduction of eosinophils as these cells are primary 
targets of IL 5 and eotaxin-1. 
The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics relationships for benralizumab were studied using steady state 
concentrations and efficacy endpoints (AER and FEV1 as primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, 
respectively). The exposure response could not be established with the two studied endpoints suggesting 
a plateau of drug effect has been reached. 
Overall, in the Phase III studies, 7 to 14% of patients developed ADA to benralizumab, which appeared in 
the majority of patients to be neutralising and persistent. These ADAs increased the clearance of 
benralizumab and tended to allow for earlier eosinophil recovery. In rare cases, blood eosinophil counts 
returned to pre-treatment levels. Although these ADAs did not have any apparent impact on efficacy 
during the follow-up period and were not associated with hypersensitivity reactions, further data on the 
long-term impact of persistent neutralising ADAs will be provided from the extension trials as part of the 
RMP. Nevertheless, pursuing the administration of benralizumab should be reconsidered in individual 
patients where blood eosinophil counts return to pre-treatment levels. 
2.6.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Extensive PK and PD data have been submitted, and in general, the PK and PD profile of benralizumab 
have been well characterised. There is no need for dose adjustment in patients with liver or renal 
impairment but the SmPC mentions the limited data available in patients with creatinine clearance values 
less than 30 mL/min. 
There is no need for dose adjustment in the elderly; however, there are no data in patients over 75 years 
of age and this should be specified in the SmPC. 
There are no data for paediatric patients below the age of 12 years but the current indication is only 
claimed in adults and this is specified in the SmPC. 
The immunogenicity of benralizumab has been well characterised. It is surprising that ADAs have no 
apparent impact on efficacy despite a clear effect on drug concentration and blood eosinophil level. 
However, further data on the impact of persistent neutralising ADAs in the long-term will be provided 
from the extension trials as part of the RMP.

2.7.  Clinical efficacy 
2.7.1.  Dose-response studies and main clinical studies 
Study MI-CP220 
A Phase IIb dose-ranging study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MEDI-563 in adults with 
uncontrolled asthma 
This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study evaluating the efficacy and 
safety of multiple-dose SC administration of benralizumab (2, 20, or 100 mg) in adult patients with 
uncontrolled asthma. Investigational product was administered as SC injections Q4W for the first 3 doses 
then Q8W thereafter for the last 4 doses on Weeks 16, 24, 32, and 40. After Week 40, patients were 
followed for an additional 12 weeks (through Week 52) for assessment of acute exacerbations. 
Eligible patients were classified and stratified during the 3-week screening/run-in period as being either 
eosinophil positive (EOS+) or eosinophil negative (EOS-), using the ELEN Index together with elevated 
baseline FeNO. The ELEN Index was developed as a surrogate marker of sputum eosinophils ≥2% using 
multivariate statistical modelling of baseline sputum and blood data from a Phase IIa clinical study 
The primary objective was to evaluate the effect of SC benralizumab on the annual asthma exacerbation 
rate in EOS+ adult subjects with inadequately controlled asthma. An asthma exacerbation was defined as 
a progressive increase of asthma symptoms (cough, wheeze, chest tightness, and/or shortness of breath) 
that did not resolve after the initiation of rescue medications and remained troublesome for the subject 
resulting in the use of systemic corticosteroids (tablets, suspension or injection) or increase of a stable 
systemic maintenance dose for a duration of at least 3 days. 
The primary endpoint of the study was met as there was a statistically significant 41% reduction in the 
annual asthma exacerbation rate (AER) in the EOS+ 100 mg benralizumab arm versus the EOS+ placebo 
arm (p=0.096- note that p < 0.169 was considered statistically significant). A 36% reduction (NS) in the 
AER was also seen in the EOS+ 20 mg benralizumab arm versus the EOS+ placebo arm and a 22% 
reduction (NS) in the AER in the EOS- 100 mg benralizumab arm versus the EOS- placebo arm. Greater 
improvement was evident in subjects with higher baseline peripheral blood eosinophil counts suggesting 
that peripheral blood eosinophil count may be a useful marker to predict the efficacy of benralizumab in 
uncontrolled asthma. 
Exacerbation studies 
The two exacerbation studies of a replicate design were conducted in parallel and are presented together: 
Study D3250C00017 (SIROCCO) and Study D3250C00018 (CALIMA).

• 
Overall study design 
The design was the same except for the treatment duration: 48 weeks in SIROCCO and 56 weeks for 
CALIMA. There were three treatment arms: 
  Benralizumab Q4W: one SC injection of 30 mg every 4 weeks 
  Benralizumab Q8W: one SC injection of 30 mg every 4 weeks for the first 3 doses, thereafter every 8 
weeks 
 
Placebo 
In the EU, following PDCO request, only the Q8W regimen was administered to adolescents after the first 
3 doses; therefore, the randomisation was 1:1 to benralizumab or placebo every 8 weeks. 
SIROCCO study 
Overall study design (SIROCCO) 
  Main objectives 
Primary: To evaluate the effect of 2 dosing regimens of benralizumab on asthma exacerbations in patients 
on high-dose ICS-LABA with uncontrolled asthma 
Secondary: To assess the effect of 2 dosing regimens of benralizumab on pulmonary function, asthma 
symptoms and other asthma control metrics, asthma-related and general health-related quality of life, 
ER/urgent care visits and hospitalisations due to asthma 
•

  with at least 2 documented asthma exacerbations requiring use of systemic CS (or temporary 
increase from usual maintenance OCS dose) in the 12 previous months. 
• 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
Annual asthma exacerbation rate, where an asthma exacerbation was defined by a worsening of asthma 
requiring: 
•  use of systemic corticosteroids (or a temporary increase in a stable OCS background dose) for at least 
3 days; a single depo-injectable dose of corticosteroids was considered equivalent to a 3-day course 
of systemic corticosteroids 
•  an ER/urgent care visit (defined as evaluation and treatment for <24 hours in an emergency 
department or urgent care centre) due to asthma that required systemic corticosteroids (as per 
above) 
•  an inpatient hospitalisation due to asthma (defined as an admission to an inpatient facility and/or 
evaluation and treatment in a healthcare facility for ≥ 24 hours) 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
•  Pulmonary function: pre-bronchodilator FEV1 at the study centre 
•  Asthma symptoms and other asthma control metrics as per an ePRO device provided to the patient: 
asthma symptom score (total, daytime, and night time), rescue medication use, morning and evening 
peak expiratory flow (PEF), nights with awakening due to asthma, ACQ-6 score (Asthma Control 
Questionnaire) 
•  Other parameters associated with exacerbations: time to first asthma exacerbation, annual rate of 
asthma exacerbations that are associated with an ER/urgent care visit or a hospitalisation 
•  Health-related QoL outcome: AQLQ(S)+12 (Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire for 12 Years and 
Older) 
• 
Randomisation 
Patients were allocated to the three treatment arms in a 1:1:1 ratio. The randomisation was stratified by 
age (adults/adolescents), country/region and eosinophil count at screening (≥300/µL or <300/µL) and 
ICS dose (medium/high) for Study 018.

The primary analysis set included only patients receiving high ICS dose and with baseline blood eosinophil 
count ≥300/µL. 
To account for multiplicity to test the primary (annual asthma exacerbation rate) and 2 key secondary 
endpoints (the change in FEV1 and asthma symptom score from baseline to Week 48, respectively) for 
each of the 2 dosing regimens (for patients with baseline blood eosinophils ≥300/µL) a gate-keeping 
procedure was followed to control the overall type I error rate. 
The primary efficacy variable was the annual asthma exacerbation rate (annualised exacerbation rate) 
and the primary analysis was to compare the unadjudicated annual asthma exacerbation rate (based on 
data reported by the investigator in the eCRF) of each benralizumab dosing regimen with placebo. The 
test used a binomial model with the response variable being the number of asthma exacerbations 
experienced by a patient over the double-blind treatment period; the model included covariates of 
treatment group, region, number of exacerbations in the previous year, and the use of maintenance OCS 
(yes/no). The logarithm of the patient’s corresponding follow-up time was used as an offset variable in the 
model to adjust for patients having different exposure times during which the events occur. 
Sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint and the key secondary endpoints based on different missing 
data mechanism assumptions: Missing at Random (MAR), Partial Dropout Reason-based Multiple 
Imputation (Partial-DRMI), Dropout Reason-based Multiple Imputation (DRMI). Missing counts were 
imputed differently depending on the reason for dropout in the last two cases. 
Change from baseline in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 and in asthma symptom score was compared between 
each of the 2 benralizumab treatment groups and the placebo group using a mixed-effect model for 
repeated measures (MMRM) analysis on patients with a baseline value assessment and at least 1 
post-randomisation assessment. Treatment group was fitted as the explanatory variable, region, the use 
of maintenance OCS (yes/no), visit, and treatment*visit interaction as fixed effects and baseline value as 
a covariate.

• 
Overall study design 
The same randomisation within three treatment arms as in the exacerbation studies was used. The 
treatment period was divided into 3 phases: 
• 
Induction (from Week 0 to Week 4; patients remained on the optimised OCS dose) 
•  Reduction (from Week 4 to Week 24, inclusive; OCS dose reduction was initiated at Week 4 with dose 
reduction following at 4-week intervals) 
•  Maintenance (after Week 24 to Week 28; the dose of OCS reached at Week 24 or complete elimination 
of OCS was maintained). 
There was a run in/OCS optimisation of up to 10 weeks preceding the randomisation. The dose of OCS 
was titrated during the optimisation and reduction phases of the study according to specific algorithms in 
the protocol. Patients who met some pre-specified criteria were eligible for OCS dose reduction during the 
run-in/OCS optimisation phase and during the reduction phase. Failed attempts at OCS dose reduction 
were those which resulted in documented clinical deterioration or reduced lung function attributed to 
asthma.

• 
Randomisation 
Patients were allocated to the three treatment arms in a 1:1:1 ratio. The randomisation was stratified by 
country/region and baseline blood eosinophils count (≥150 to <300 cells/µL and ≥300 cells/µL) 
• 
Statistical methods 
To account for multiplicity in testing the primary endpoint for the 2 dosing regimens, a testing strategy 
was followed to control the overall type I error rate using the Hochberg procedure.  
The primary efficacy variable was the percentage reduction from baseline in the final OCS dose while 
maintaining asthma control. The baseline OCS dose was defined as the dose upon which the patient was 
stabilised at randomisation (Week 0). Unless otherwise stated below, the final dose was generally defined 
as the dose at Week 28. For each of the 2 benralizumab dose regimen arms, the percentage reduction was 
compared to the placebo arm using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. 
If a patient discontinued from the study during a given dose reduction interval prior to Visit 14 (Week 28), 
then the patient’s final OCS dose was defined as 1 dose level higher than the dose at which the 
discontinuation occurred. If a patient’s asthma deteriorated or an exacerbation occurred during the 
maintenance phase, the final dose was deemed as 1 dose level higher than the dose at which the asthma 
exacerbation or deterioration started. 
Assessment report  
EMA/780390/2017  
Page 47/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Following review of blinded preliminary data from the study database, instances were identified of 
patients who recorded an exacerbation following randomisation, but for whom, contrary to the process 
outlined in the protocol, the site appeared to continue down-titration of the OCS dose following the 
exacerbation. As a sensitivity analysis, assessment of the primary endpoint was conducted where, for 
patients who recorded an exacerbation, the final OCS dose used in the percent reduction from baseline 
calculation was the OCS dose 1 step higher than the dose at which their first exacerbation started. 
For the secondary OCS categorical endpoints, a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was used controlling for 
region. Annual rate of asthma exacerbations were analysed using a negative binomial model as for the 
two previous studies. 
• 
Participant flow 
Of 369 patients enrolled, 271 patients entered run-in/OCS optimisation. Of these, 220 patients were 
randomised to receive treatment with benralizumab 30 mg Q4W (72), Q8W (73), or placebo (75) and a 
total of 51 patients were not randomised. The most frequent reasons for exclusion from randomisation 
were eligibility criteria not fulfilled (35 patients) and development of study-specific withdrawal criteria (14 
patients). 
A total of 207 (94.1%) patients completed treatment with study drug. The proportions of patients who 
discontinued treatment were similar across the arms. 
A total of 54 patients (24.5%) had at least one important protocol deviation, with a greater percentage in 
the placebo arm (27 [36.0%] patients) compared with the benralizumab 30 mg Q4W (15 [20.8%] 
patients) and Q8W arms (12 [16.4%] patients). The important protocol deviations were those affecting 
the assessment of the primary efficacy endpoint.

Subgroup analyses 
Integrated efficacy data were analysed by pre-defined subgroups of age at randomisation, gender, BMI, 
OCS use at baseline, number of asthma exacerbations in previous year, race, geographic region, and 
country. 
Reductions in annual asthma exacerbation rate were similar or favoured benralizumab 30 mg Q4W and 
Q8W over placebo for all subgroups with the exception of adolescents (ages 12 to <18 years) and Black 
or African Americans, each of which had a small number of patients/events. 
Differences between regions were observed and further studied. Central and Eastern Europe, which 
showed the lowest treatment effect of any region in the benralizumab 30 mg Q8W arm, included Bulgaria, 
Czech Republic, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation, and Ukraine. A consistent lack of treatment effect 
(equivalent to placebo) was observed in most of these countries, with the exception of the Russian 
Federation, and an effect clearly favouring placebo was observed in the Romania. Romania accounts for

4.2% of patients in CALIMA and the Central and Eastern Europe region accounts for ~35% of patients in 
CALIMA. The crude placebo rates in the Central and Eastern Europe countries ranged from 0.21 to 1.40 in 
the integrated data and were some of the lowest across all countries. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was analysed post hoc by geographic regions categorised as EU, North 
America, and RoW; EU was classified in two different ways. The results from these analyses indicated that 
the reductions in annual asthma exacerbation rate favoured benralizumab 30 mg Q8W over placebo in 
each of the 3 geographic regions analysed: 
• 
EU: 33% (placebo rate: 1.20) but 54% (placebo rate: 1.96) when restricted to Western EU countries 
(Germany, Spain, France, United Kingdom, Italy, and Sweden); 
• 
• 
North America: 41% (placebo rate: 1.43); 
RoW: 52% (placebo rate: 1.27) but 40% (placebo rate: 1.08) when including eastern EU countries. 
Subgroup analyses from SIROCCO and CALIMA identified patients with higher prior exacerbation history 
and baseline blood eosinophil count as potential predictors of improved treatment response. When 
considered alone or in combination, these factors may further identify patients who may achieve a greater 
response from benralizumab treatment (see figure below).

Efficacy in children and adolescents 
A total of 108 adolescent patients, aged 12 – 17 years (mean 14.3 years), were evaluated for the primary 
efficacy endpoint and selected secondary efficacy endpoints, in concordance with the requirements from 
the PDCO. They were only 68 in the group with baseline blood eosinophils ≥300/µL. The results of the 
primary endpoint are shown below.

Annual asthma exacerbation rate ratio in adolescent patients (Integrated SIROCCO/CALIMA - 
FAS) 
In contrast to the results in adults, there was no detectable difference between the benralizumab and 
placebo arms for each of these endpoints, and the 95% confidence intervals were wide for each of these 
repeated measures analyses. While eosinophil depletion was observed in adolescent patients treated with 
benralizumab, there was a lack of any consistent trend favouring benralizumab across efficacy endpoints, 
and point estimates generally favoured placebo albeit with very wide confidence intervals. Adolescent 
patients in SIROCCO and CALIMA when compared with the overall population (adults and adolescents 
combined) at baseline had better FEV1, lower symptoms, and fewer prior exacerbations. These 
differences along with the low placebo exacerbation rate suggest that the adolescent population differs 
from the adult population in these studies. The small sample size and the wide confidence intervals 
around treatment differences do not allow definitive conclusions to be made. 
Supportive studies 
Lung-function study in patients with mild to moderate asthma (BISE) 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of benralizumab on pulmonary function in 
mild to moderate asthmatic patients using FEV1 as the primary endpoint. The key secondary objectives 
were to assess the effects of benralizumab on asthma symptoms and other asthma control metrics. 
Of the 211 patients randomised, all patients received at least one dose of IP; a total of 197 (93.4%) 
patients completed treatment. In general, demographic characteristics were balanced across the 2 
treatment groups with respect to age, gender, race, and ethnicity. The patient population was 
predominantly White (93.4%). A high percentage of the patient population was in the obese (23.2%) or 
morbidly obese (17.5%) category. Demographic and patient characteristics of the baseline blood 
eosinophil count ≥300/µL and <300/µL subgroups were similar to those of the full analysis set. 
A statistically significant improvement in change from baseline pre-bronchodilator FEV1 at Week 12 was 
observed for benralizumab compared with placebo (0.08 L [0.00, 0.15], p=0.040). Modelling of 
pre-bronchodilator FEV1 change from baseline suggested an increased treatment effect as the baseline

blood eosinophil count increased. In general, positive trends in favour of benralizumab were observed 
across a number of secondary endpoints, although none of the differences were statistically significant at 
a nominal 5% significance level. 
At-home use study (GREGALE) 
This study included 116 male and female patients 18 to 75 years of age with severe asthma (ie, 
uncontrolled asthma despite receiving medium- or high-dose ICS/LABAs and OCS with or without 
additional asthma controllers). A total of 109 patients (94.0%) completed treatment with IP; all of whom 
completed the study. The majority of patients were White (81.0%), and approximately half of the patients 
were female (55.2%). The mean age was 47.6 years (range: 18 to 75 years). 
The primary objective was to assess patient- or caregiver-reported functionality and reliability of the 
benralizumab accessorised pre-filled syringe (APFS) in an at-home setting and performance of the APFS 
after use. This aspect of this study pertains to the use of the device, not the efficacy of benralizumab. A 
secondary objective was to assess the effect of benralizumab on asthma control metrics, specifically the 
change from baseline in mean ACQ-6 score. Decreases from baseline in the mean ACQ-6 score were 
observed at all post-baseline time points, and a greater percentage of patients had an ACQ-6 score that 
indicated their asthma was well controlled at Week 20 (26%) compared with baseline (4%). More than 
half of patients (57%) reported to be improved based on ACQ-6 score at Week 20. 
2.7.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
This application is based on three pivotal placebo-controlled trials in severe uncontrolled asthma, for 
which the Applicant received CHMP scientific advice. Two trials with a replicate design investigated the 
effect of benralizumab on asthma exacerbations and a third trial investigated its potential corticosteroid 
sparing effect. 
The study population of these three trials had severe uncontrolled asthma defined in accordance with 
current guidelines (ATS, GINA - 2014). These patients required treatment with medium-to-high dose 
inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) combined with a long-acting β2 agonist (LABA), with or without additional 
maintenance controllers including oral corticosteroids (GINA Steps 4 and 5). Despite of this treatment, 
these patients had persistent airflow obstruction, asthma symptoms, and a history of frequent 
exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroid treatment (at least two per year in the exacerbation 
studies). 
The key dose-ranging Phase II trial had evaluated the effect of benralizumab on the annual asthma 
exacerbation rate in uncontrolled eosinophilic asthma using the ELEN Index (a surrogate marker of 
sputum eosinophils ≥2%) together with elevated baseline FeNO. While the trial failed to meet its primary 
objective, it showed that pre-treatment eosinophil blood count was positively correlated with treatment 
benefit; above the threshold of 400 cells/µL, a clinically relevant response was apparent at doses of 20 
and 100 mg. There were no selection criteria of eosinophilic asthma in the Phase III exacerbation studies 
but the primary analysis was in the population of patients on high ICS dose and with baseline eosinophil 
blood count ≥300 cells/μL. In the OCS reduction study, only patients with peripheral blood eosinophil 
count ≥150 cells/µL were enrolled. 
All three placebo-controlled pivotal trials tested two dosing regimens using the same benralizumab dose 
(30 mg) administered at a different frequency after three 4-weekly doses: continuing every 4 weeks or 
with longer intervals of 8 weeks.

Exacerbation studies 
In line with current CHMP guidance, the duration of the exacerbation trials was ~12 months (with a 
double-blind treatment of 48 months in one trial and 56 months in the other). 
The primary endpoint of asthma exacerbations corresponds to ‘severe exacerbations’ as defined in ATS 
and CHMP guidelines (need for systemic CS, emergency room visit or hospitalisation due to asthma). It is 
agreed that this is the most important outcome in this patient population because they constitute the 
greatest risk to patients, are a cause of anxiety to patients and their families, result in the greatest stress 
on health care providers, and generate the greatest cost to the health care system. In addition, serious 
exacerbations requiring ER/urgent care visit or hospitalisation were adjudicated by an independent 
committee. 
The main secondary endpoints were pulmonary function tests (pre-bronchodilator FEV1), asthma 
symptoms measured by patients at home with a dedicated ePRO device and reflected in the asthma 
symptom score as well as in the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-6), quality of life assessed with the 
standardised Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ(S)+12). These are all validated questionnaires 
and the secondary endpoints are considered appropriate. 
The randomisation was central and stratified by age (adults/adolescents), country/region and eosinophil 
count at screening (≥300/µL or <300/µL) and ICS dose (medium/high) for one of the studies). The trials 
were conducted in a double-blind, double-dummy fashion, with patients and investigators involved in 
their treatment and clinical evaluation were not aware of the treatment allocation. Specific measures 
were taken to maintain the blind to blood eosinophil counts, which were performed in a central laboratory. 
OCS reduction study 
The third trial was designed to investigate the corticosteroid sparing effect of benralizumab in patients 
requiring at least 7.5 mg/day of oral prednisone or equivalent; this dose is considered to have significant 
toxicity, especially when combined with the burden of high ICS doses. The trial included before 
randomisation an OCS optimisation phase (up to 8 weeks) to establish the lowest OCS dose needed to 
control the patient’s symptoms, this dose being stable for the last 2 weeks before randomisation. 
However, historical dose optimisation (i.e. failed attempt to reduce OCS dose within the preceding 6 
months) was also accepted if adequately documented in the source records. 
After randomisation, this dose had to be maintained for 4 weeks before the OCS reduction phase was 
started following a pre-defined algorithm. This phase lasted 20 weeks and was followed by a maintenance 
phase of 4 weeks without any dose adjustment, during which the evaluation of outcomes was conducted. 
The maintenance period of 4 weeks, although considered acceptable for short-term evaluation, was 
confirmed with longer follow-up to evaluate the durability of the response. 
The primary endpoint in this trial was the relative reduction in OCS dose compared with the baseline dose 
while maintaining asthma control (no worsening of asthma symptoms and pulmonary function; no 
exacerbation). Furthermore, while the CHMP endorsed the study design, it also advised that the absolute 
decrease in OCS would be a key secondary endpoint and that this should be clinically meaningful and 
evaluated in relation to the baseline dose. However, this was neither implemented nor discussed by the 
Applicant. 
The secondary endpoints were related to the OCS dose reductions as well as asthma exacerbations, FEV1, 
asthma symptom score, ACQ-6 and AQLQ(S)+12 scores. 
The three trials were multinational and the EU contributed to more than one third to half of the study 
population, especially Eastern EU countries. A double-blind extension of the three studies is ongoing with 
some interim results provided upon CHMP request.

Population 
The pooled population of the full efficacy analysis set (i.e. with baseline blood eosinophils ≥300/µL and 
high-dose ICS) comprised 1537 patients, with a median age of 51 years, only 46 adolescents and 174 
elderly patients ≥65 years of age (11%). As expected in this adult asthma population, the majority (63%) 
were female and obesity (a risk factor for poor asthma control) was reported in 35% of the cases. Most 
patients (about 80%) were Caucasian. Median EBC was 500/µL with a maximum of 4,000; this means 
that half of the patients had mild/moderate eosinophilia. Moderate hypereosinophilia (EBC ≥1,500/µL) 
was reported in up to 3% of patients with no other diagnosis than asthma and often allergic 
manifestations. 
The population in Study 017 (SIROCCO) appeared to exhibit slightly more severe disease than in Study 
018 (CALIMA): slightly lower median pre-bronchodilator FEV1 (57% vs 59% predicted) at baseline; 
higher proportion of patients with ≥4 exacerbations in the previous year (21% vs. 16%) and with at least 
one hospitalisation (25% vs 18%); higher median ACQ-6 score (2.83 vs. 2.67). The demographics and 
baseline disease characteristics were broadly similar across treatment arms (~ 500 patients each). 
All patients were taking ICS and LABA as required by protocol except for 2 subjects that did not take 
LABA. The median dose of ICS was 1000 µg/d in adults and 500 µg/d in adolescents. The proportion of 
patients taking at least one additional controller was 51% in SIROCCO and 41% in CALIMA; most patients 
(63% and 66%, respectively) were taking one additional controller, the most frequent being a leukotriene 
receptor antagonist (LTRA). Slightly more patients were taking OCS in SIROCCO (16%) than in CALIMA 
(11%) but overall, this proportion was not very high. Maintenance therapy was broadly comparable 
between treatment arms. It was stable in most patients since overall, only 7% patients had any dose 
increase or initiated a new background asthma controller medication during the study, with the number of 
patients evenly distributed across treatment arms. 
In both studies, treatment adherence was good with only 11% of patients discontinuing treatment. The 
main reason was patient decision (5%), which is unfortunately not very informative. Nevertheless, 
treatment withdrawals and their reasons were balanced across treatment arms. Likewise, a high 
proportion of patients (about 90%) completed the studies. 
The level of important protocol deviations (about 8%) is considered low; most were related to asthma 
documentation regarding spirometry results (5%). They were also balanced across treatment arms. This 
observation does not raise any concern.

In both studies, the crude annual exacerbation rate on placebo was below 2/year, especially in CALIMA, 
where it was ~1/year, which would not correspond to the target population of patients with uncontrolled 
asthma and frequent (≥ 2) severe exacerbations. Likewise, the proportion of patients with at least one 
serious exacerbation (requiring ER/hospitalisation) was low on placebo, especially in CALIMA (< 10%), 
where this proportion was similar in all treatment arms. The differences between the placebo arms of the 
two studies are consistent with the baseline characteristics of the two study populations suggesting that 
patients in SIROCCO were more severely affected than in CALIMA. 
While the two trials met their primary endpoint, the treatment effect in relative terms (exacerbation rate 
reduced by approximately 40% for both regimens in the integrated analysis) and absolute terms (an 
estimated difference of about 0.5/year, from 1.14 to 0.66/year) is considered modest from a clinical 
perspective. When comparing the two studies, the magnitude of the treatment effect in both relative and 
absolute terms appeared greater in a population with more frequent exacerbations as reflected in the 
crude placebo rates. The two regimens appeared equivalent in the integrated analysis. While 2 dosing 
regimens were studied in the phase III clinical trials, the recommended dosing regimen is an 
administration every 4 weeks for the first 3 doses, then every 8 weeks thereafter (see section 4.2) as no 
additional benefit was observed by more frequent dosing (see also section 2.6.3). 
Given the low frequency of serious exacerbations in this population, the clinical relevance of the benefit in 
terms of decrease in ER visits or hospitalisations is questionable. Unexpectedly, only the regimen with 
less frequent dosing achieved a statistically significant difference, decreasing the annual rate from 0.10 to 
0.06/year (38% in relative terms) in the integrated analysis. It is considered that this result is not robust 
and no relevant benefit on ER visits/hospitalisations can be attributed to benralizumab in these trials. 
Secondary endpoints 
Pulmonary function 
Significant increase in the pre-bronchodilator FEV1 (key secondary endpoint) was reported at the end of 
treatment with benralizumab compared to placebo. Unexpectedly, the improvement was more important 
with less frequent dosing in SIROCCO; it is noted that there was already a difference between the two 
regimens at week 4 and 8, while all patients were receiving the same treatment. 
Mean improvements of more than 200 mL were measured in all treatment arms, including placebo. Mean 
differences between benralizumab and placebo ranged between 100 and 160 mL, which can be 
considered clinically relevant. The results of other endpoints support some level of improvement in 
pulmonary function with benralizumab compared to placebo with no obvious differences between the two 
dosing regimens. 
Asthma symptoms 
A statistically significant improvement in total asthma symptom score and ACQ-6 score was only 
observed with the lower frequency regimen compared to placebo while no or borderline significant 
difference was observed with the higher frequency regimen. It is noted that the placebo effect was 
important with an absolute decrease in the asthma total score of about 1 and in in the ACQ-6 score >1 
both trials. The clinical relevance of a mean difference between placebo and benralizumab of 0.25 for the 
asthma score is unknown as there is no accepted minimally clinically important difference (MCID) for this 
endpoint. For the ACQ-6 score, a mean difference between placebo and benralizumab of 0.2 to 0.3 is 
below the MCID of 0.5. However, according to a literature review (Bateman, 2015), to exceed this MCID 
is hardly achievable when treatments are added to highly effective medications, such as ICSs or 
ICS/LABA combinations. 
Assessment report  
EMA/780390/2017  
Page 64/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When analysed in terms of ACQ-6 responders (patients achieving a minimally clinically important 
difference of ≤-0.5), at least half the patients responded to placebo and the difference with benralizumab 
was very small, at maximum 10% in one study in favour of the Q8W regimen. Furthermore, the 
proportion of patients that were not well controlled (score ≥ 1.5) at the end of the trial was not very 
different between the benralizumab and placebo arms: 31-32% vs. 37% in SIROCCO and 33-35% vs 
41% in CALIMA, respectively. 
Importantly, the small differences in asthma scores did not translate into significant difference in the use 
of asthma rescue medication between treatment arms (~ -0.5 puffs/day). Likewise, a similar decrease in 
the proportion of nights with nocturnal awakenings due to asthma was reported across all treatment 
arms. 
Finally, the quality of life analysis (AQLQ(S)+12) showed results in line with the asthma scores. A 
responder analysis (improvement ≥ 0.5) indicated better results overall in CALIMA than SIROCCO with no 
significant differences between benralizumab and placebo arms: 55-57% vs 49% in SIROCCO and 
60-61% vs 59% in CALIMA. 
It is concluded that asthma control improved in all treatment arms throughout the trials and the 
differences between benralizumab and placebo appear to be small. However, the interpretation of these 
PRO outcomes is unclear in this clinical setting (patients with severe asthma on a combination of high ICS 
dose and LABA), as reflected by similar results for previously authorised anti-IL5 products. 
Subgroup analyses 
Efficacy on the primary endpoint was observed in all subgroups with the exception of adolescents (ages 
12 to <18 years) and Black or African Americans, each of which had a small number of patients/events. 
The Applicant is not proposing to include adolescents in the indicated population at this time. In CALIMA, 
while the point estimate favoured placebo for the Black/African American subgroup, the placebo event 
rate was low and the CI was wide given the small number of patients. This trend was not replicated in 
SIROCCO, and therefore, while the data supporting efficacy in this population are limited, the Applicant 
considers that there is no reason to conclude that benralizumab would behave differently in this patient 
population. In addition, given the increased asthma morbidity and mortality reported in Black/African 
American asthmatic patients, this subgroup has not been excluded from the indicated population. 
The Applicant has investigated in depth the differences in the treatment effect between regions and 
countries. These appeared largely driven by the placebo crude exacerbation rates, the treatment effect 
tending to be higher when placebo rate was higher. As already highlighted, the overall placebo rates were 
low in the two studies despite the inclusion criterion of ≥ 2 exacerbations in the previous year. It is unclear 
how this criterion could be verified based on the patient medical notes and the number of severe 
exacerbations may well have been overestimated, especially for enrolment purposes. It is noteworthy 
that the two countries that enrolled the highest numbers of patients in CALIMA were Argentina (placebo 
crude rate: 0.68) and Poland (placebo crude rate: 0.67). 
In Western EU, the annual exacerbation rate was reduced by 54% from a placebo rate of 1.96/year, but 
the effect was decreased to 33% when Eastern EU countries were added. 
Potential predictors of efficacy 
Outcomes generally improved as the number of exacerbations in the previous year increased, which 
logically translated into increasing placebo crude exacerbation rates: 0.59/year in patients with 2 
Assessment report  
EMA/780390/2017  
Page 65/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
exacerbations in the previous year vs. 1.71/year in patients with ≥ 3 exacerbations in the previous year 
(CALIMA). 
Outcomes also improved as the baseline blood eosinophil count (BEC) increased. In the largest subgroup 
of patients with ≥ 450 cells/µL, annual exacerbations rates (AER) were reduced by 41% with the Q4W 
regimen and 50% with the Q8W regimen; at week 48, pre-bronchodilator FEV1 had increased on average 
by 154 mL with the Q4W regimen and 224 mL with the Q8W regimen (integrated analysis). 
An analysis where both factors were combined was conducted with the cut-off of 300/µL for BEC. In the 
subpopulation of patients with 2 exacerbations in the previous year, where the placebo annual 
exacerbation rate was ≤1, there was little difference in the outcomes according to BEC and the treatment 
effect was minimal: AER reduction by 25-35% and marginal increase in mean pre-bronchodilator FEV1 
(13-105 mL). In contrast, in the subpopulation of patients with ≥ 3 exacerbations in the previous year, 
where the placebo annual exacerbation rate was about 2, patients with higher baseline BEC fared better 
than those with lower baseline BEC: AER reduction by ~50% vs ~30%, respectively, and increase in 
mean pre-bronchodilator FEV1 of 121 mL (Q4W) and 252 mL (Q8W) vs. 33 mL (Q4W) and 75 mL (Q8W). 
It is concluded that the benefit of benralizumab, especially the Q8W regimen, is demonstrated in patients 
with a high frequency of asthma exacerbations and high BEC. However, in those with a low frequency of 
exacerbations, the benefit is extremely modest, if not marginal, regardless of their BEC level. 
Nevertheless, the Applicant considers that it is unnecessary to single out and include prior history of 
exacerbations in the indication statement and that there is no single eosinophil level that defines the 
eosinophilic phenotype. The Applicant argues that efficacy was demonstrated across a range of baseline 
eosinophil levels, including in the <300/μL population. As such, an eosinophil cut-off is not included in the 
proposed indication. Of note, however, baseline blood eosinophil level and prior history of exacerbation 
are both potential predictors of benefit in patients to be prescribed benralizumab, and therefore, this 
evidence has been added to Section 5.1 of the proposed SmPC. This option is acceptable and is in line with 
the SmPC of similar products. 
OCS reduction study 
Population 
A total of 220 patients were randomised to receive treatment with benralizumab 30 mg Q4W (72), Q8W 
(73), or placebo (75). Treatment adherence was good with only 6% of patients discontinuing treatment. 
Likewise, a high proportion of patients (about 95%) completed the study. 
A high level (25%) of important protocol deviations regarding the determination of the OCS dose (primary 
endpoint) was reported as investigators and/or patients did not adhere to the titration algorithm. The 
deviation rate appeared imbalanced, with almost twice as many deviations in the placebo arm than in the 
benralizumab arms. Some of these imbalances are likely to favour placebo while others are likely to 
favour benralizumab; however, the biases are expected to be in favour of placebo, and thus, do not raise 
concern. 
Given the small sample size of the study, some differences were observed across treatment arms, e.g. 
slightly older patients with longer asthma duration, lower BEC at baseline, and higher number of 
exacerbations in the previous year, in the benralizumab Q8W arm compared to the placebo arm. 
More than half the patients (53%) took additional controller(s), mainly an LTRA, and this was well 
balanced over treatment arms. The ICS dose tended to be higher in the placebo arm but the median was 
1000 µg/d of fluticasone propionate equivalent in all arms. A small percentage of patients (2%) deviated 
Assessment report  
EMA/780390/2017  
Page 66/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
from protocol because they received a dose lower than 500 µg/d but they were equally distributed across 
the three treatment arms. 
For 67/220 patients (30%), historical optimisation occurred; this was roughly balanced across treatment 
arms (26%, 33% and 32% in the benralizumab Q4W, Q8W and placebo, respectively). At baseline 
(pre-randomisation), the OCS dose was ≤ 10 mg/d in the majority of patients (114/220 patients; 52%) 
while it was between 11.5 and 20 mg/d in 83 patients (38%) and > 20 mg/d in 23 patients (11%). 
Although the OCS dose was in the low-medium range in most patients, the cumulative burden with the 
ICS dose has to be taken into account. There were few dose modifications during the optimisation phase, 
with only 20% (31/153) of dose reductions. 
It is considered that the study population was representative of the target population. The majority of 
patients had uncontrolled asthma (based on ACQ-6 score) and two thirds had experienced at least 2 
exacerbations in the previous year (although this number may be questionable like in the exacerbation 
studies). 
Primary endpoint 
Overall, the proportion of patients that could reduce their OCS dose was 76% and 79% in the 
benralizumab Q4W and Q8W arms, respectively, compared to 53% in the placebo arm. The median 
percent reduction was 75% in the benralizumab arms versus 25% in the placebo arms, which was 
statistically significant (p< 0.001). About one third of the patients (33% and 37% in the benralizumab 
arms, respectively) had a dose reduction of > 90% compared with 12% of the patients in the placebo 
arm. 
Absolute changes in OCS dose have also been provided. Patients with relatively low baseline doses (≤12.5 
mg/d –  median 10 mg/d) had a final median dose of 0 and a median decrease of 7.5 mg/d in the 
benralizumab arms vs a median decrease of 2.5 mg/d in the placebo arm (final dose of 7.5 mg/d). 
Patients with higher baseline doses (>12.5 mg/d – median 20 mg/d) had a final median dose of 7.5-10 
mg/d and a median decrease of 12-14 mg/d in the benralizumab arms vs a median decrease of 5 mg/d in 
the placebo arm (median dose of 15 mg/d).  Given the correlation between systemic CS dose and 
occurrence of adverse reactions, dose reductions of the magnitude observed in the benralizumab arms 
(median 7 – 14 mg/d) are considered clinically relevant. Furthermore, the objective of achieving a final 
dose ≤ 5mg is considered clinically meaningful; this was achieved by 61% and 59% of the patients in the 
benralizumab arms (Q4W and Q8W, respectively) vs 33% in the placebo arm (p ≤ 0.002). 
While it is agreed that a reduction by ≤ 5 mg in OCS dose is not clinically meaningful, a smaller proportion 
of patients had a meaningless OCS decrease in the benralizumab 30 mg Q4W and Q8W arms compared 
with the placebo arm (31% and 34% vs 51%, respectively; p=0.012 and 0.053, respectively). However, 
this result is not considered compelling from a clinical perspective. 
In line with the outcomes in the exacerbations studies, results improved as baseline BEC increased and 
also as the number of previous yearly exacerbations increased, the main reason being that the placebo 
response decreased while the response to benralizumab was similar; the proportion of patients that could 
reduce their OCS dose decreased from 67% (1 exacerbation in the previous year) to 38% (≥3 
exacerbations in the previous year) while this proportion ranged between 72% and 83% in the 
benralizumab arms. 
The % reduction was roughly the same irrespective of the baseline OCS dose (≤ 10 mg/d or > 10 mg/d). 
Finally, for this primary variable of OCS dose, there was no clear trend for a difference between the two 
benralizumab regimens.

Secondary endpoints 
Twice as many patients experienced at least one exacerbation during the study in the placebo arm 
compared to the benralizumab arms. The annualised exacerbation rate was 1.80 on placebo and the 
decrease with benralizumab was notable considering that the OCS dose was reduced in these patients. 
The regimen with the lower dosing frequency appeared more effective with an AER decreased by 70% (vs 
55% in the benralizumab Q4W arm). 
The mean improvement in FEV1 compared to placebo (about 100 mL) was not statistically significant. A 
significant improvement in ACQ-6 and AQLQ(S)+12 scores, with a decrease in the need for rescue 
medications, was only reported for the benralizumab Q8W regimen. However, in terms of responder rates 
for these scores, the difference between this regimen and placebo was small (8%). 
The proportion of patients that were still not well controlled at the end of the study was approximately the 
same in the benralizumab Q4W arm (53%) as in the placebo arm (60%), but it was much lower in the 
Q8W arm (34%). At the end of the study, the proportion of patients with deterioration of this score was 
6%, 1% and 16% in the benralizumab Q4W arm, Q8W and placebo, respectively. 
It is concluded that a clinically meaningful decrease in the frequency of asthma exacerbations was 
observed with benralizumab despite decrease in OCS dose, especially with the low frequency regimen. 
This was associated for this regimen with some degree of improvement in asthma scores. Nevertheless, 
at the end of the study, one third of the patients on this regimen were still poorly controlled. 
Durability of response 
Following CHMP request, OCS dose and exacerbation data for all benralizumab-treated patients in the 
extension trial (BORA) were analysed up to the data cut-off date of 21 October 2016. All patients had 
reached 40 weeks of treatment (i.e., 12 additional weeks after the end of ZONDA) and, at that time point, 
the proportion of patients off OCS (39% in the benralizumab Q8W arm) and those with no 
change/increase in dose (16%) were similar to those at the end of ZONDA. The median dose was 
maintained at 5 mg/d while the number of exacerbations appeared to remain stable. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
There were only 68 adolescents in the group of patients with baseline blood eosinophils ≥300/µL. 
Compared with the whole population, the enrolled adolescents appeared to have less severe disease, 
which is likely to explain treatment failure in this subgroup despite near complete depletion of eosinophils. 
The higher AER on benralizumab than on placebo has not been discussed by the Applicant. It is noted that 
in the adolescent subpopulation, the incidence of nasopharyngitis and bronchitis was higher on 
benralizumab than on placebo while it was the same in the whole population. This might have contributed 
to the increased frequency of asthma exacerbations on benralizumab. 
In conclusion, no claim can be envisaged in this paediatric population based on the results currently 
available. 
2.7.3.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
Two large well-designed pivotal exacerbations studies demonstrated a statistically significant effect of 
benralizumab on the annual rate of asthma exacerbations in a population of patients with uncontrolled 
asthma despite high ICS doses and with a baseline blood eosinophil count ≥300 cells/µL. However, this 
effect is considered modest from a clinical perspective (a difference of about 0.5 exacerbations/year, from 
~1.3 to ~0.8/year). The likely reason for this result is the low exacerbation rate in the study population 
Assessment report  
EMA/780390/2017  
Page 68/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
despite appropriate inclusion criteria. Moreover, given the low frequency of serious exacerbations in this 
population, the clinical relevance of the decrease in ER visits and hospitalisations is also questionable. 
Pooled data from the two trials did not indicate an exposure-response relationship and showed that both 
Q4W and Q8W dosing frequencies have the same efficacy profile. 
A significant effect on the pulmonary function was also observed but the impact of benralizumab on 
asthma control was small and mostly restricted to the lower frequency regimen; there is no plausible 
biological explanation for this numerical superiority. It is agreed that the interpretation of these PRO 
outcomes is unclear in this clinical setting (add-on to the combination of high ICS dose and LABA in 
patients with severe asthma), as reflected by similar results for previously authorised anti-IL5 products. 
In the small OCS sparing trial, a significant and clinically meaningful reduction in OCS dose has been 
achieved. Improvement in exacerbation rates and asthma control was again more apparent with the 
lower frequency regimen. Importantly, the effect on OCS dose and exacerbations was maintained during 
the extension study for at least 3 additional months of treatment. 
Based on the results from the three trials, the regimen selected by the Applicant for treatment 
recommendation is the lower frequency regimen (Q8W), supported and accepted by CHMP. In addition, 
the objective of the first three doses every 4 weeks is to achieve rapid airway eosinophil depletion, and 
thus, hasten the onset of treatment benefit, and to lower the incidence and affinity of ADAs against 
benralizumab. 
As reported with other mAbs targeting the same pathway in patients with an eosinophilic asthma 
phenotype, the primary effects of benralizumab are correlated with baseline eosinophil levels but it is 
agreed with the Applicant that no threshold needs to be introduced in the indication wording of the SmPC. 
The wording of the indication in the SmPC adequately reflects the target population of adult patients with 
severe eosinophilic asthma inadequately controlled despite high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus 
long-acting beta-agonists. 
2.7.4.  Clinical safety 
Analyses for the safety assessments were planned using pooled data from the Phase III, 
placebo-controlled, asthma exacerbation studies, SIROCCO and CALIMA. This is the primary pool upon 
which Integrated Summary of Safety (ISS) data have been summarised. 
The second pool comprises of all completed Phase II or III asthma studies. Nine studies are included: 
MI-CP186, MI-CP197, MI-CP220, SIROCCO, CALIMA, ZONDA, BISE, GREGALE, plus patients who 
received treatment in PAMPERO. Safety data have not been pooled due to the substantial differences in 
study design, duration, and doses studied. None of the Phase II studies evaluated the 30 mg SC fixed 
dose studied in Phase III or assessed the Q4W versus Q8W dosing regimen (after the first 3 initial 4-week 
doses). However, any relevant safety findings from these studies are presented under the appropriate 
sections, including potential risks. 
BORA is a long-term extension study for eligible patients who complete the SIROCCO, CALIMA, or ZONDA 
studies on treatment with investigational product (IP). BORA is evaluating the safety and tolerability of 
benralizumab treatment for an additional 56 weeks (adult patients) or 108 weeks (adolescent patients). 
A brief overview of blinded adverse events is presented (29 July 2016). 
A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) and two independent adjudication committees, one for asthma 
exacerbations (to review all ER visits and/or hospitalisations) and the other to review major adverse 
cardiovascular events (MACE) and malignancies, were used across the Phase III programme.

Patient exposure 
Phase III exacerbation studies 
In total, 841 patients received benralizumab 30 mg Q4W, 822 patients received benralizumab 30 mg 
Q8W, and 847 patients received placebo. Overall, a total of 1556 out of 1663 patients (93.6%) were 
treated with benralizumab for ≥24 weeks and 1387 out of 1663 patients (83.4%) were treated with 
benralizumab for ≥48 weeks.  
Duration of exposure (Safety analysis set) 
All Phase II and III studies in asthma 
Using the subcutaneous route, 2442 patients received benralizumab and 1259 patients received placebo. 
The median treatment duration was 309 days. Overall, including the intravenous route, 2514 patients 
received benralizumab and 1297 patients received placebo. 
Adverse events 
Phase III exacerbation studies 
There was a numerical imbalance in the incidence of TEAEs, with lower incidences of these events being 
reported by patients in the benralizumab 30 mg Q4W and Q8W arms compared with the placebo arm. 
Treatment-emergent AEs leading to study drug discontinuation were reported at slightly higher 
incidences by patients in the benralizumab 30 mg Q4W (2.0%) and Q8W (2.2%) arms compared with the 
placebo arm (0.8%). The incidence of SAEs was similar across arms and the incidence of deaths was low 
and similar across arms.

The most common TEAEs overall were nasopharyngitis (16.0%), asthma (14.3%), upper respiratory tract 
infection (8.7%), and bronchitis (8.3%). The incidences of the most common TEAEs (those with a 
frequency of ≥3% in any treatment arm) were similar across arms. 
Adverse events related to investigational product 
The most common TEAEs considered related to study drug by the investigator (defined as those occurring 
at a frequency of >1% patients in any treatment arm) were headache, pyrexia, and fatigue reported by 
40 (1.6%), 26 (1.0%), and 22 (0.9%) patients. The incidences of all other TEAEs assessed as related to 
study drug by the investigator were low and similar across arms. 
Adverse events by severity 
The majority of patients (90%) had events that were assessed as mild or moderate in intensity by the 
investigator; this includes events considered serious and non-serious. 
The incidence of all severe TEAEs was similar across arms: 8.9%, 10.1%, and 10.7% for benralizumab 30 
mg Q4W, Q8W, and placebo arms, respectively. Overall, the most frequently reported PTs of severe 
intensity were asthma (79 patients [3.1%]) and pneumonia (11 patients [0.4%]). The incidences of all 
other severe PTs were low and similar across arms. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Deaths 
Phase III exacerbation studies 
A total of 12 patients had TEAEs with outcomes of death: 5 in the benralizumab 30 mg Q4W arm, 4 in the 
benralizumab 30 mg Q8W arm, and 3 in the placebo arm. Nine of the deaths occurred in the on treatment 
period and 3 of the deaths occurred during the post treatment period. None of the deaths were considered 
treatment-related by the investigator. Of note, there were also 3 pre-treatment deaths. 
All deaths occurred in adults patients (range: 42 to 75 years of age); 10 patients were overweight and of 
these, 2 were obese (BMI >30 to 35 kg/m2) and 2 were morbidly obese (BMI >35 kg/m2). The causes of 
death varied with no consistent pattern across arms: myocardial infarction (2), asthma (1), cerebral 
haemorrhage (1), opioid overdose (1), sudden death (1), pulmonary embolism (1), colon neoplasm (1), 
accident/suicide (2), unknown cause (2). 
Phase III ZONDA study 
Two patients (0.9% of all patients) died in the benralizumab 30 mg Q8W arm: acute cardiac failure (1) 
and pneumonia with pulmonary insufficiency (1), the latter being considered related to the study drug by

the investigator. This 53-year-old white male, died following a TEAE of pneumonia 20 days after the third 
dose of benralizumab 30 mg. He was hospitalised and the diagnosis was right-sided community-acquired 
pneumonia with middle lobe syndrome and severe worsening bronchial asthma. The patient developed 
atrial fibrillation and although treated with amiodarone, the event persisted. The patient had 
hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, angina pectoris, and congestive heart failure. 
Other studies 
One additional patient died in the BISE study received 3 doses of benralizumab 30 mg and died due to an 
SAE of pancytopenia. Risk factors for the event included a history of asbestos exposure and concomitant 
use of ramipril and amiodarone. The event was not considered related to study drug by the investigator 
and Sponsor. 
Serious Adverse Events 
Phase III exacerbation studies 
Overall, 299 patients (11.9%) had SAEs (including those with an outcome of death) during the 
on-treatment period. A slightly lower incidence of SAEs was reported by patients in the benralizumab 30 
mg Q4W (92 patients [10.9%]) and benralizumab Q8W (92 patients [11.2%]) arms compared with the 
placebo arm (115 patients [13.6%]). 
The most common SAEs by PT (defined as those occurring at a frequency of >2 patients in any treatment 
arm) were asthma, pneumonia, osteoarthritis, hypertension, and nephrolithiasis, reported by 139 
(5.5%), 16 (0.6%), 6 (0.2%), 4 (0.2%), and 3 (0.1%) of all patients, respectively. The incidences of the 
most common SAEs were similar across arms, and with the exception of the PT of asthma, the incidence 
of SAEs was low (<1% in any treatment arm). 
A total of 8 patients (0.3%) had the following SAEs considered related to the study drug by the 
investigator: 
•  4 patients (0.5%) in the benralizumab 30 mg Q4W (1 patient each with SAEs of allergic 
granulomatous angiitis [synonymous with Churg-Strauss syndrome], panic attack, paraesthesia, and 
urticaria); 
•  2 patients (0.2%) in the benralizumab 30 mg Q8W arm (1 patient each with SAEs of asthma and 
herpes zoster); 
•  2 patients (0.2%) in the placebo arm (1 patient each with SAEs of injection site erythema and 
non-cardiac chest pain). 
Of note, the SAE of paraesthesia was not a demyelinating event (verbatim term: paraesthesia of lower 
limbs with pain); the event was severe in intensity and was not resolved at the end of the study. The SAE 
of urticaria in the benralizumab 30 mg Q4W arm was not resolved at the end of the study; all other SAEs 
that were considered related to study drug by the investigator were resolved. 
Phase III ZONDA study 
A lower incidence of SAEs was reported by patients in the benralizumab 30 mg Q4W and Q8W arms 
compared with the placebo arm (7 of 72 patients [9.7%], 7 of 73 patients [9.6%], and 14 of 75 patients 
[18.7%], respectively). Asthma (7 patients [3.2%]) and pneumonia (5 patients [2.3%]) were among the 
most commonly reported SAEs, in addition to status asthmaticus (3 patients [1.4%]), and influenza (2 
patients [0.9%]). No other SAEs were reported for more than one patient in any treatment arm. A total 
of 3 patients (1.4%) had the following SAEs considered treatment-related by the investigator: 1 patient 
Assessment report

(1.4%) in the benralizumab 30 mg Q4W arm with an SAE of hypersensitivity and 2 patients (2.7%) in the 
benralizumab 30 mg Q8W arm with SAEs of pneumonia and presyncope (verbatim term: vasovagal 
reaction after administration of the last dose of study drug). 
Laboratory findings 
In the Phase III studies, there were no clinically meaningful trends in haematology and clinical chemistry 
parameters, no clinically meaningful shifts in haematology and clinical chemistry parameters for 
individual patients, and the incidence of TEAE PTs related to haematology and clinical chemistry were low 
and similar across arms. 
There were non-clinically significant decreases in both studies from baseline in neutrophils and 
lymphocytes in the benralizumab 30 mg Q4W and Q8W arms; corresponding decreases from baseline 
were not observed in the placebo arm. However, the mean absolute values remained within their 
respective reference ranges at all post-baseline time points and there were no apparent clinical 
manifestations associated with these transient changes. 
There were no clinically meaningful trends in urinalysis, immunoglobulins, or T cell, B cell and natural 
killer cell flow cytometry findings over time and no clinically important findings identified in any treatment 
arm. 
In the ECG sub-study conducted as part of SIROCCO, no clinically meaningful differences between the 
total benralizumab and placebo arms at Week 4/Day 6 were observed for any of the ECG variables, 
including the QT interval. At Week 4/Day 6, the incidence of QTcF outliers remained the same in the 
benralizumab arm compared to baseline; in the placebo arm, 5 patients (7.1%) had QTcF values of >450 
ms and no patients had values of >480 ms. No patients in either treatment arm reported increases from 
baseline of >30 or >60 ms. No treatment-emergent findings were identified and the ECG assessments 
coincided with the benralizumab time to maximum concentration (Tmax). 
Potential risks 
Potential risks based on the mechanism of actions and/or potential risks with monoclonal antibodies 
include serious infections, risk of helminthic infection, hypersensitivity reactions (including immune 
reactivity), and malignancy. 
Serious infections 
Phase III asthma exacerbation studies 
A total of 49 patients (2.0%) had SAEs under the SOC of Infections and infestations: 12 (1.4%) in the 
benralizumab 30 mg Q4W arm, 18 (2.2%) in the benralizumab 30 mg Q8W arm, and 19 (2.2%) in the 
placebo arm. 
The most common serious infection PTs were pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia, influenza, appendicitis 
and bacterial urinary tract infection (see table). Bronchitis, chronic sinusitis, and viral pneumonia were 
reported by 2 patients overall but not within a single treatment arm. Overall, the pattern of serious 
infections was expected for a population of high-risk severe asthma patients. 
Only one of the infectious SAEs was considered treatment-related by the investigator: herpes zoster 
(verbatim term: shingles face - no intraorbital involvement), reported by a patient in the benralizumab 30 
mg Q8W arm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/780390/2017  
Page 73/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Phase III ZONDA study 
Twelve (12) of 220 patients (5.5%) had SAEs under the SOC of Infections and infestations during the 
on-treatment period: 2 of 72 patients [2.8%] and 2 of 73 patients [2.7%] in the benralizumab 30 mg 
Q4W and Q8W arms, respectively, vs 8 of 75 patients [10.7%] in the placebo arm. 
Pneumonia (5 patients [2.3%]) and influenza (2 patients [0.9%]) were the most commonly reported 
serious infections, with a lower incidence of these events being reported by patients in the benralizumab 
30 mg Q4W and Q8W arms compared with the placebo arm. With the exception of an SAE of pneumonia 
reported by one patient in the benralizumab 30 mg Q8W arm (see SAE section), none of these SAEs was 
considered treatment-related by the investigator. 
Herpes zoster 
An analysis of all TEAEs (serious and non-serious) of herpes zoster in the Phase III exacerbation studies 
was done based on feedback from the FDA. Events included herpes zoster, shingles, herpes infection 
forehead, and herpetic neuritis. In the on-treatment period, these TEAEs were similar across treatment 
arms, reported by 3 patients (0.4%) in the benralizumab 30 mg Q4W arm and 6 patients (0.7%) in both 
the benralizumab 30 mg Q8W and placebo arms. Apart from the case mentioned above, all of the other 
events were non-serious. 
In addition, one patient in MI-CP220 (benralizumab 100 mg arm) had an SAE of herpes zoster that was 
considered by the investigator to be related to study drug. The patient experienced an SAE of moderate 
herpes zoster 17 days after receiving the fifth dose of study drug; the patient also had an SAE of moderate 
asthma. The event resolved with sequelae of paraesthesia and pain; other immunosuppressive risk 
factors were a prior bout of bronchitis that preceded the asthma exacerbation and a systemic course of 
corticosteroids used to treat the severe asthma exacerbation during the patient’s hospitalisation. 
Helminthic infections 
A theoretical risk of depleting eosinophils is interference with expulsion of helminthic parasites. Patients 
at high risk for these infections were monitored for such infections as per local medical practice while on 
benralizumab. No cases of helminthic infections were reported in the Phase III studies. 
Two patients in MI-CP220, one each in the benralizumab 2 mg and 100 mg arms had TEAEs associated 
with helminthic parasites; both patients had TEAEs of strongyloidiasis based on positive serology 
(research tool) only and were asymptomatic; one patient was already positive at screening and the other 
was living in an endemic area. Both patients received anti-strongyloides treatment and completed the 
study. 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Phase III asthma exacerbation studies 
A total of 78 patients (3.1%) had hypersensitivity TEAEs during the on-treatment period, with similar 
incidences across arms: 26 (3.1%) in the benralizumab 30 mg Q4W arm, 24 (2.9%) in the benralizumab 
Q8W arm and 28 (3.3%) in the placebo arm. The most common hypersensitivity TEAE was urticaria, 
reported by 46 patients (1.8%) overall, with similar incidence across arms.  
Of the 50 patients with hypersensitivity TEAEs receiving benralizumab, 27 had a history of allergy to one 
or more substances, 14 had nasal polyposis and 11 had atopic dermatitis (eczema). There were 3 SAE 
events of urticaria, 5 cases of hypersensitivity related to a concomitant medication and 2 TEAEs of 
anaphylactic reactions in the same patient due to food/peanut allergies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/780390/2017  
Page 74/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A total of 14 patients (0.6%) had hypersensitivity TEAEs judged causally related to study drug by the 
investigator. Seven of these patients continued treatment with the study drug. The majority of related 
hypersensitivity TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity and subsequently resolved. 
Phase III ZONDA study 
A total of 4 of 220 patients (1.8%) had hypersensitivity TEAEs during the on-treatment period, and the 
incidences of TEAEs of hypersensitivity were low and similar across arms: 1 of 72 patients (1.4%) in the 
benralizumab 30 mg Q4W arm, 2 of 73 patients (2.7%) in the benralizumab Q8W arm, and 1 of 75 
patients (1.3%) in the placebo arm. The most common hypersensitivity TEAE was urticaria. All cases were 
assessed as causally related to study drug by the investigator and were mild to moderate in intensity, with 
the exception of one SAE of severe allergic reaction, which led to treatment (benralizumab 30 mg Q4W) 
discontinuation. 
Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) 
In the Phase III exacerbation studies, 17 patients (0.7%) had 18 TEAEs submitted to the MACE 
subcommittee for adjudication in the on-treatment period; a total of 11 patients (0.4%) had MACE as 
determined by the Safety Endpoint Adjudication Committee (SEAC): 
  3 patients (0.4%) in the benralizumab 30 mg Q4W arm 
  4 patients (0.5%) in the benralizumab 30 mg Q8W arm 
  4 patients (0.5%) placebo arm. 
Of the 7 patients who received benralizumab, four had a history of, or concurrent heart disease and/or 
risk factors for heart disease, including hypertension, hypercholesterolemia/hyperlipidaemia, history of 
coronary artery disease, heart failure, and angina. None of the events were considered treatment-related 
by the investigator. 
In the ZONDA study, 2 patients, both in the benralizumab Q8W arm (2.7%), had 1 TEAE each submitted 
to the SEAC; these 2 fatal TEAEs (acute cardiac failure and pneumonia) were not determined by the SEAC 
to be MACE (the death by acute cardiac failure was judged “undetermined death”). 
Malignancies 
In the Phase III exacerbation studies, 5 patients had 5 TEAEs during the on-study period submitted to the 
malignancy sub-committee for adjudication: 3 in the benralizumab 30 mg Q4W arm (ovarian epithelial 
cancer, gall bladder cancer, gastric cancer); 1 in the benralizumab 30 mg Q8W arm (colon cancer) and 1 
in the placebo arm (breast cancer). All of these malignancies were adjudicated as new malignancies and 
considered not related to study drug by the investigator. 
Three malignancies were reported by investigators in other studies: papillary thyroid cancer 
(benralizumab 30 mg), cervix carcinoma (placebo), and malignant melanoma (benralizumab 100 mg). 
Injection site reactions 
In the Phase III asthma exacerbation studies, a total of 61 patients (2.4%) experienced injection site 
reactions: 27 (3.2%) in the benralizumab 30 mg Q4W arm, 18 (2.2%) in the benralizumab 30 mg Q8W 
arm and 16 (1.9%) in the placebo arm. The administration site most commonly associated with injection 
site reactions was the arm (41 events [1.6%]).  
Overall, the most frequently reported injection site reactions were injection site pain (20 patients [0.8%]) 
and injection site erythema (19 patients [0.8%]). With one exception, all injection site reactions were 
non-serious, transient in nature, and the majority were mild in intensity. One patient in the placebo arm 
Assessment report  
EMA/780390/2017  
Page 75/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
had an SAE of injection site erythema that was severe in intensity and resulted in the study drug being 
withdrawn; the SAE appeared to be associated with intramuscular administration rather than SC 
administration by the site, as indicated by magnetic resonance imaging results. 
In the ZONDA study, a total of 4 patients (1.8%) experienced mild injection site reactions: 2 patients 
(2.8%) in the benralizumab 30 mg Q4W arm, no patients in the benralizumab 30 mg Q8W arm, and 2 
patients (2.7%) in the placebo arm. 
Adverse drug reactions 
Adverse events considered as adverse drug reactions (ADRs) by the Applicant are: pharyngitis, 
headache, pyrexia, hypersensitivity reactions, and injection site reactions. This is based on incidences in 
the exacerbation studies and information from outside the benralizumab development programme. For 
the ADR of hypersensitivity reactions, although the incidence was similar across the benralizumab 30 mg 
Q4W, Q8W, and placebo arms (3.1%, 3.2%, and 3.2%, respectively), a qualitative review of cases 
combined with a plausible mechanism of action suggest that there may be a reasonable possibility of a 
causal relationship between benralizumab and the events to support the inclusion of hypersensitivity 
reactions (urticaria, papular urticaria and rash) as an ADR. 
Safety in special populations 
Use in pregnancy 
Out of 18 pregnancies on benralizumab, there were 9 deliveries of healthy babies, 3 spontaneous 
abortions, 3 elective abortions, 2 anomalies (prenatal hydronephrosis, cytogenetic anomaly at a prenatal 
test), and one lost to follow-up. 
Out of 7 pregnancies on placebo, there were 5 deliveries of healthy babies, 1 spontaneous abortion, and 
1 elective abortion. 
Use in the elderly 
In the Phase III exacerbation studies, there was no clear trend for TEAEs in patients aged ≥65 years, who 
had a lower incidence in the benralizumab 30 mg Q4W arm (70.6%), and a higher incidence in the 
benralizumab 30 mg Q8W and placebo arms (82.4% and 83.3%, respectively) compared with patients 
aged 18 to 64 years (74.0%, 72.4%, and 77.1%, respectively). 
The incidences of SAEs were slightly higher in patients aged ≥65 years for the benralizumab 30 mg Q4W, 
Q8W, and placebo arms (13.8%, 15.4%, and 17.5%, respectively) compared with patients aged 18 to 64 
years (10.6%, 11.3%, and 13.4%, respectively). Deaths were reported for 8 patients aged 18 to 64 years 
(4 in the benralizumab 30 mg Q4W arm, 3 in the benralizumab 30 mg Q8W arm, and 1 in the placebo 
arm) and 1 patient aged ≥65 years (placebo arm). 
Incidences of the most common TEAEs were generally similar in patients aged ≥65 years and patients 
aged 18 to 64 years. 
Use in adolescents 
Adolescent patients in the EU were not randomised to the benralizumab 30 mg Q4W arm; thus, there 
were fewer adolescent patients in the benralizumab 30 mg Q4W arm (24 patients) compared with the 
benralizumab 30 mg Q8W and placebo arms (38 and 46 patients, respectively). 
Assessment report  
EMA/780390/2017  
Page 76/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The incidences of TEAEs in adolescent patients in the Phase III exacerbation studies were lower in all 
arms, including placebo (range: 58.3% to 63.2%) compared with the overall population (range: 73.1% to 
77.1%). 
Five adolescent patients reported SAEs; 2 (8.3%) in the benralizumab 30 mg Q4W arm and 3 (6.5%) in 
the placebo arm; no deaths were reported in adolescent patients. The number of TEAEs leading to 
treatment discontinuation were low, with no notable difference in adolescent patients compared with 
patients overall. 
In general, the incidences of the most common TEAEs were lower in adolescent patients compared with 
patients overall (adults and adolescents), with the exception of sinusitis, pharyngitis, bronchitis and 
pyrexia. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The effect of OCS use on AEs rates has been evaluated in the asthma exacerbation studies. 
Patients with OCS use reported higher incidences of TEAEs compared with patients with no OCS use in the 
benralizumab 30 mg Q4W (87.5% vs 71.3%), benralizumab 30 mg Q8W (85.0% vs 71.2%), and placebo 
(89.9% vs 75.2%) arms. Patients with OCS use reported also higher incidences of SAEs compared with 
patients with no OCS use in the benralizumab 30 mg Q4W (21.9% vs 9.5%), benralizumab 30 mg Q8W 
(15.9% vs 10.4%), and placebo (22.9% vs 12.2%). 
The higher incidences of TEAEs and SAEs in patients with OCS use are not unexpected given that the 
patients with OCS use were those with more severe disease. In addition, a proportion of the TEAEs and 
SAEs may be attributable to the OCS use itself. 
Among the most commonly reported TEAEs, incidences between the benralizumab 30 mg Q4W and Q8W 
arms were generally similar in patients with and without OCS use. However, nasopharyngitis and 
headache were reported at higher incidences in patients with OCS use compared with patients with no 
OCS use in the benralizumab 30 mg Q4W arm (24.0% vs 15.3% and 19.8% vs 5.9%, respectively) and 
benralizumab 30 mg Q8W arm (23.0% vs 14.0% and 15.0% vs 7.6%, respectively). Importantly, for 
these two events, the incidences were higher in patients with OCS use when comparing to placebo 
(13.8% for nasopharyngitis and 7.3% for headache) while they were similar in patients without OCS use 
(16.8% and 6.1%, respectively). 
Discontinuation due to AEs 
Phase III exacerbation studies 
A total of 44 patients (1.8%) had TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation: 18 (2.1%) in the 
benralizumab 30 mg Q4W arm, 18 (2.2%) in the benralizumab 30 mg Q8W arm, and 8 (0.9%) in the 
placebo arm. The only TEAEs leading to discontinuation that occurred in ≥2 patients in any treatment arm 
were asthma (4 patients overall [0.2%]), urticaria (3 patients overall [0.1%]), and rash and arthralgia (2 
patients overall for each [0.1%]); the incidences of these TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation 
were similar across arms. There was no pattern observed or single PT driving differences between arms 
in patients who discontinued treatment. 
Phase III ZONDA study 
A total of 5 patients (2.3%) had TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation. Three patients (4.1%) in the 
benralizumab 30 mg Q8W arm reported 4 TEAEs leading to discontinuation: allergic dermatitis, acute

cardiac failure (a fatal SAE), pneumonia (a fatal SAE), and atrial fibrillation (also an SAE). In addition, 2 
patients (2.7%) in the placebo arm reported 2 TEAEs leading to discontinuation: urticaria and pericarditis 
(also an SAE). 
2.7.5.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database comprises a total of 2575 patients having received at least 1 dose of benralizumab 
and 1307 patients having received placebo, which is considered an acceptable population size. Currently, 
only 1-year data are available and extension studies are ongoing over 2 additional years. The two large 
exacerbation studies form the basis for the evaluation of the safety profile of benralizumab at its 
recommended regimen. Following CHMP request, an interim analysis of the SAE reports collected in the 
extension trials and the KHK trial for registration in Asia has been provided (cut-off date 21 October 
2016). 
Treatment-emergent AEs, including severe TEAEs, occurred slightly less frequently on benralizumab than 
on placebo; the difference was mainly driven by asthma events and bronchitis. However, headache, 
pharyngitis (but not nasopharyngitis), cough and pyrexia were slightly more frequent on benralizumab 
than on placebo. Their frequency was < 10%. The vast majority of TEAEs (90%) was mild or moderate. 
Investigators attributed headache, fatigue and pyrexia to the drug but the incidence of fatigue being 
comparable on placebo, it is unlikely that this was drug-related. 
There were 15 deaths during the clinical programme, 12 in benralizumab-treated patients, and most were 
associated to comorbidities/risk factors in a population severely affected since 3 patients also died during 
screening. One case of fatal pneumonia complicated with atrial fibrillation in a patient with congestive 
heart failure was considered drug-related; infection is a known risk for this type of treatment. The high 
mortality rate in overweight/obese patients did not appear to be related to a lack of treatment benefit in 
these patients. 
SAEs rates were low (about 12% overall) and slightly lower on benralizumab than on placebo. Asthma 
was the most common SAE (frequency of ~ 5%). The incidences of the other most common SAEs were 
low and similar across treatment arms. A few SAEs were attributed by the investigator to study drug; this 
is plausible for asthma, infections, allergic reactions but unlikely for Churg-Strauss syndrome, panic 
attack and paraesthesia. The interim analysis of the ongoing extension trials did not suggest any increase 
in the occurrence of SAEs or any new safety signal as treatment duration increased beyond one year. 
About 2% of patients discontinued benralizumab treatment, slightly more than placebo. The main 
reasons were asthma and allergic-type reactions. 
Based on mechanism of action and type of molecule potential risks include serious infections, helminthic 
infection, hypersensitivity reactions, and malignancy. During the clinical programme there was no 
increase in the incidence of serious infections, of herpes zoster and helminthic infections over a 1-year 
period. There does not appear to be an increased cardiovascular risk and malignancy risk either. 
However, this will need to be confirmed with the longer-term data of the extension studies. 
A low rate of hypersensitivity reactions (~ 3%) was reported and it was comparable on benralizumab and 
placebo. Even those attributed by the investigator to the study drug (< 1% in the exacerbation studies) 
were equally frequent across treatment arms. Therefore, benralizumab appears to have low allergic 
potential and most of the reported hypersensitivity reactions are likely to be associated to other allergic 
factors in this asthma population. Out of ~ 1800 patients, only 2 patients (0.1%) developed a serious 
urticaria that was attributed to benralizumab and led to treatment discontinuation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/780390/2017  
Page 78/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The rate of injection site reactions was slightly higher with benralizumab compared to placebo but the 
majority were mild in intensity. 
On the basis of the Phase III exacerbation studies, the proposed list of ADRs is agreed (pharyngitis, 
headache, pyrexia, hypersensitivity reactions, and injection site reactions). 
Data on pregnancy exposure from the clinical studies (18 cases) are insufficient to inform on 
drug-associated risk but do not raise concern. Therefore, the SmPC recommend to avoid the use of 
benralizumab during pregnancy. 
The safety in the elderly (up to 75 years) does not raise any concern. There are almost no data above 75 
years of age (4 patients in the 75-84 years’ age range) but there was no trend of increased toxicity with 
age. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
In general, the AEs profile appeared better in adolescents than in adults regardless of the treatment but 
these data are limited and no indication is claimed in this population. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.7.6.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Treatment with benralizumab is well tolerated, irrespective of the frequency of administrations, as 
reflected in the short list of generally mild adverse reactions. Although longer-term data are needed to 
confirm that there is no risk of serious infections and malignancies, there is currently no major clinical 
safety concern with the use of this product. A specific clinical study will be implemented in the post 
marketing setting to monitor the risk of malignancies.

use) states the following: 
Parasitic (Helminth) Infection 
None 
Eosinophils may be involved in 
the immunological response to 
some helminth infections. 
Patients with known helminth 
infections were excluded from 
participation in clinical trials. It 
is unknown if Fasenra may 
influence a patient’s response 
against helminth infections.                                
Patients with pre-existing 
helminth infections should be 
treated before initiating therapy 
with Fasenra. If patients 
become infected, while 
receiving treatment with 
Fasenra and do not respond to 
anti-helminth treatment, 
treatment with Fasenra should 
be discontinued until infection 
resolves. 
None 
Benralizumab SmPC Section 4.3 
(Contraindications) states that 
Fasenra is contraindicated in 
patients with hypersensitivity to 
the active substance or to any of 
the excipients listed in SmPC 
Section 6.1 (List of excipients). 
Benralizumab SmPC Section 4.4 
(Special warnings and 
precautions for use) states the 
following: Hypersensitivity 
reactions (eg, urticaria, papular 
urticaria, rash) have occurred 
following administration of 
Fasenra. These reactions 
generally occur within hours of 
administration, but in some 
instances have a delayed onset 
(i.e. days). In the event of a 
hypersensitivity reaction, 
Fasenra should be discontinued.                   
SmPC Section 4.8 (Undesirable

Overall, treatment -emergent 
anti- drug antibody response 
developed in 107 out of 809 
(13%) patients treated with 
Fasenra at the recommended 
dosing regimen during the 48 to 
56 week treatment period of the 
exacerbation trials. Most 
antibodies were neutralising 
and persistent. Anti 
-benralizumab antibodies were 
associated with increased 
clearance of benralizumab and 
increased blood eosinophil 
levels in patients with high anti- 
drug antibody titres compared 
to antibody negative patients; 
in rare cases, blood eosinophil 
levels returned to baseline 
levels. Based on current patient 
follow-up, no evidence of an 
association of anti- drug 
antibodies with efficacy or 
safety was observed 
In addition SmPC section 4.2 
(Posology and method of 
administration) includes the 
following instruction: Fasenra is 
intended for long-term 
treatment. A decision to 
continue the therapy should be 
made at least annually based on 
disease severity, level of 
exacerbation control and blood 
eosinophil counts.

Pregnancy 
There is a limited amount of 
data (less than 300 pregnancy 
outcomes) from the use of 
benralizumab in pregnant 
women.  
Animal studies do not indicate 
direct or indirect harmful effects 
with respect to reproductive 
toxicity. See Section 5.3 
(Preclinical safety data).  
Monoclonal antibodies, such as 
benralizumab, are transported 
across the placenta linearly as 
pregnancy progresses; 
therefore, potential exposure to 
a fetus is likely to be greater 
during the second and third 
trimester of pregnancy.   
It is preferable to avoid the use 
of Fasenra during pregnancy. 
Its administration to pregnant 
women should only be 
considered if the expected 
benefit to the mother is greater 
than any possible risk to the 
fetus.

Breast-Feeding  
It is unknown whether 
benralizumab or its metabolites 
are excreted in human or animal 
milk. Risk to the breast-fed child 
cannot be excluded. 
A decision must be made 
whether to discontinue 
breast-feeding or to 
discontinue/abstain from using 
Fasenra taking into account the 
benefit of breast-feeding for the 
child and the benefit of therapy 
for the woman. 
Fertility  
There are no fertility data in 
humans. Animal studies showed 
no adverse effects of 
benralizumab treatment on 
fertility. See SmPC Section 5.3 
(Preclinical safety data).            
Safety profile of the long-term 
use of benralizumab 30 mg SC 
SmPC Section 4.8 (Undesirable

None 
A total of 2,514 patients, out of 
whom 1,663 patients had 
severe uncontrolled eosinophilic 
asthma received benralizumab 
during clinical studies of 48 to

Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant request alignment of the PSUR cycle with 
the international birth date (IBD). The IBD will be in line with the pending FDA approval date which will be 
available within November 2017. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to determine the 
forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.10.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that benralizumab has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in the 
European Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers benralizumab to be a new active substance as it is not 
a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.11.  Product information 
2.11.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.11.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Fasenra (benralizumab) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as  
 
It contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal 
product authorised in the EU; 
 
It is a biological product that is not covered by the previous category and authorised after 1 
January 2011; 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The term “eosinophilic asthma” describes a subphenotype of asthma characterised by elevated levels of 
eosinophils in bronchial biopsies or sputum despite chronic and correct use of adequate doses of inhaled 
corticosteroids (ICS). The target population remains uncontrolled with the current standard of care, i.e. 
treatment with the combination of high-dose ICS and long-acting β2 agonist (LABA) plus possibly a third 
controller or OCS (Steps 4 and 5 of the GINA classification). Patients who remain uncontrolled continue to 
suffer symptoms, frequent exacerbations, and compromised quality of life. Exacerbations typically 
require treatment with high doses of systemic corticosteroids and may also require hospitalisation. 
Uncontrolled asthma can lead to a dependence on oral corticosteroids, which has significant morbidity. 
The aim of therapy is to improve asthma control by reducing the frequency of asthma exacerbations, 
improving lung function and decreasing asthma symptoms. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
As shown in GINA step 5, the add-on maintenance therapies currently available for these patients are 
tiotropium for inhalation and three targeted therapies with injectable monoclonal antibodies: omalizumab 
(anti-IgE), mepolizumab and reslizumab (anti-IL-5). The last two molecules target the same pathway as 
benralizumab, and therefore, the unmet medical need claimed by the Applicant is not endorsed by CHMP. 
However, the frequency of administrations is lower than for the two other anti-IL-5 products, and 
therefore, benralizumab administration could be more convenient for the patient. 
3.1.3.  Clinical studies 
The application is supported by two large randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trials (SIROCCO 
and CALIMA) of a replicate design (exacerbation studies) in patients with uncontrolled asthma despite 
inhaled corticosteroid plus long-acting β2-agonist and one small randomised double-blind 
placebo-controlled trial (ZONDA) (OCS reduction study). Two dosing frequencies were tested (30 mg 
subcutaneously every 4 or 8 weeks) over 12 months in the exacerbation studies and 6 months in the OCS 
reduction study. Together, about 1500 patients (500/treatment arm) with severe uncontrolled asthma 
receiving high doses of ICS+ LABA (± third controller) and with baseline blood eosinophil count ≥300 
cells/µL were randomised in the exacerbation studies. Eligible patients should also have experienced at 
least 2 asthma exacerbations requiring systemic CS during the 12 months preceding study entry. 
In the third trial (OCS sparing effect), 220 patients (~75/treatment arm) with severe asthma receiving 
high doses of ICS+ LABA + OCS and with baseline blood eosinophil count ≥150 cells/µL were randomised.

  benralizumab Q8W 
58.9% vs 33.3% - OR = 2.74 [1.41, 5.31]; p = 0.002 
A reduction in the annual asthma exacerbation rate over 28 weeks was observed compared to placebo: 
  benralizumab Q4W

  benralizumab Q8W 
RR = 0.30 [0.17, 0.53]; p < 0.001 
The durability of the effects of benralizumab on the OCS dose and exacerbations has been shown for at 
least 3 additional months of treatment in the extension trials. 
Subgroup analyses identified prior exacerbation history and baseline blood eosinophil count as potential 
predictors of improved treatment response. When considered alone or in combination, these factors may 
further identify patients who may achieve a greater response from benralizumab treatment. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In both exacerbation studies, the crude annual exacerbation rate on placebo was below 2/year, especially 
in CALIMA, where it was ~1/year, which would not correspond to the target population of patients with 
uncontrolled asthma and frequent (≥ 2) severe exacerbations. 
Likewise, the proportion of patients with at least one serious exacerbation (requiring ER/hospitalisation) 
was low on placebo, especially in CALIMA (< 10%), where this proportion was similar in all treatment 
arms. A significant reduction in the rate of serious exacerbations was only found for benralizumab Q8W in 
SIROCCO (RR = 0.37; p < 0.001). Therefore, this result is not robust. 
In both studies, the treatment effects on asthma symptoms and asthma control as well as quality of life 
did not appear consistent across the two dosing regimens in contrast with the effect on exacerbations and 
FEV1. Unexpectedly, the lower frequency regimen appeared the most efficacious. Likewise, in the OCS 
reduction study, the treatment effects on asthma symptoms, asthma control as well as quality of life did 
not appear consistent across the two dosing regimens. Again, the lower frequency regimen appeared the 
most efficacious. While no plausible biological explanation for this observation could be found, the Q8W 
regimen is considered the most appropriate. 
There were notable differences in the treatment effect between regions and countries. These appear 
largely driven by the placebo crude exacerbation rates, the treatment effect tending to be higher when 
placebo rate is higher. It is noteworthy that the two countries that enrolled the highest numbers of 
patients in CALIMA were Argentina (placebo crude rate: 0.68) and Poland (placebo crude rate: 0.67). In 
Western EU, the annual exacerbation rate was reduced by 54% from a placebo rate of 1.96/year, but the 
effect was decreased to 33% when Eastern EU countries were added. 
No treatment effect was observed in the subgroup of adolescents that were enrolled in the exacerbation 
trials. Therefore, benralizumab is only proposed as add on therapy in adults patients with severe 
eosinophilic asthma inadequately controlled despite high dose corticosteroid plus long-acting β-agonist.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Treatment-emergent AEs, including severe TEAEs, occurred slightly less frequently on benralizumab than 
on placebo; the difference was mainly driven by asthma events and bronchitis. 
SAEs rates were low (about 12% overall) and slightly lower on benralizumab than on placebo. Asthma 
was the most common SAE (frequency of ~ 5%). The incidences of the other most common SAEs were 
low and similar across treatment arms. 
About 2% of patients discontinued benralizumab treatment, slightly more than placebo. The main 
reasons were asthma and allergic-type reactions. 
A low rate of hypersensitivity reactions (~ 3%) was reported and it was comparable on benralizumab and 
placebo. Even those attributed by the investigator to the study drug (< 1% in the exacerbation studies) 
were equally frequent across treatment arms. 
The rate of injection site reactions was slightly higher with benralizumab compared to placebo but the 
majority were mild in intensity. 
On the basis of the Phase III exacerbation studies, the proposed list of ADRs to be specified in the SmPC 
includes  few adverse drug reactions: pharyngitis, headache, pyrexia, hypersensitivity reactions, and 
injection site reactions. 
In the Phase III exacerbation studies, there was no clear trend for TEAEs in patients aged ≥65 years 
compared with patients aged 18 to 64 years. The incidences of SAEs were slightly higher in patients aged 
≥65 years for the benralizumab 30 mg Q4W, Q8W, and placebo arms (13.8%, 15.4%, and 17.5%, 
respectively) compared with patients aged 18 to 64 years (10.6%, 11.3%, and 13.4%, respectively). 
Incidences of the most common TEAEs were generally similar in patients aged ≥65 years and patients 
aged 18 to 64 years. 
Overall, in the Phase III studies, 7 to 14% of patients developed ADA to benralizumab, which appeared in 
the majority of patients to be neutralising and persistent. These ADAs increased the clearance of 
benralizumab and tended to allow for earlier eosinophil recovery. However, these ADAs did not have any 
apparent impact on short-term efficacy and were not associated with hypersensitivity reactions. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There are almost no data in patients above the age of 75 years as this is not a substantial subgroup in the 
target population. Furthermore, the safety profile of benralizumab did not appear to worsen with age and 
the potential for drug-drug interaction is very low. 
Direct blockade of IL-5 by other antibodies does not lead to complete loss of eosinophils due to redundant 
signalling by IL-3 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor. The additional action of 
benralizumab to deplete eosinophils through ADCC may pose additional risks than a purely blocking 
antibody. Currently, the data submitted do not show any evidence that use of benralizumab would pose 
an increased risk of cancer in patients. 
Data are limited data beyond one year of treatment and therefore the potential risk of serious infections 
and malignancies cannot be adequately evaluated. However, the interim analysis of the ongoing 
extension trials did not suggest any increase in the occurrence of SAEs or any new safety signal as 
treatment duration increased beyond one year. Likewise, the long-term impact of persistent neutralising 
ADAs will be further characterised based on information from the extension trials. Submission of the full 
reports of the ongoing studies, when completed, is included in the RMP.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Effect on asthma exacerbations 
While the two exacerbation trials met their primary endpoint, the treatment effect in relative terms 
(exacerbation rate reduced by approximately 40% for both regimens in the integrated analysis) and 
absolute terms (an estimated difference of about 0.5/year, from 1.14 to 0.66/year) is considered modest 
from a clinical perspective. The magnitude of the treatment effect in both relative and absolute terms 
appeared greater in patients with more frequent exacerbations as reflected in the crude placebo rates. 
Therefore, a likely explanation for the failure to achieve better results is related to the selection of patients 
that did not have a prior history of sufficiently frequent and/or documented severe asthma exacerbations. 
Likewise, given the low frequency of serious exacerbations in this population, the clinical relevance of the 
benefit in terms of decrease in ER visits or hospitalisations is questionable. Unexpectedly, only the 
regimen with less frequent dosing achieved a statistically significant difference, decreasing the annual 
rate from 0.10 to 0.06/year (38% in relative terms) in the integrated analysis. 
Mean improvements of more than 200 mL were measured in all treatment arms, including placebo. Mean 
differences between benralizumab and placebo ranged between 100 and 160 mL, which can be 
considered clinically relevant. 
It is noted that for the outcomes of total asthma symptom score and ACQ-6 score, the placebo effect was 
important with an absolute decrease in the asthma total score of about 1 and in the ACQ-6 score >1 in 
both trials. The clinical relevance of a mean difference between placebo and benralizumab of 0.25 for the 
asthma score is unknown as there is no accepted minimally clinically important difference (MCID) for this 
endpoint. Likewise, the clinical relevance of a difference of 0.2 to 0.3 for the ACQ-6 score may be 
questioned as this is below the MCID of 0.5. However, according to a literature review (Bateman, 2015), 
to exceed this MCID is hardly achievable when treatments are added to highly effective medications, such 
as ICSs or ICS/LABA combinations. 
Importantly, the small differences (asthma symptom and ACQ-6) between benralizumab and placebo in 
asthma scores did not translate into significant difference in the use of asthma rescue medication 
between benralizumab and placebo (~ -0.5 puffs/day). Likewise, a similar decrease in the proportion of 
nights with nocturnal awakenings due to asthma was reported across benralizumab and placebo arms.

Finally, a responder analysis of the quality of life questionnaire AQLQ(S)+12 (improvement ≥ 0.5) 
indicated better results overall in CALIMA than SIROCCO with no significant differences between 
benralizumab and placebo arms: 55-57% vs 49% in SIROCCO and 60-61% vs 59% in CALIMA. 
OCS sparing effect 
The available analysis in terms of % reduction in OCS dose is difficult to interpret (median reduction of 
75% for benralizumab vs 25% for placebo) but a median absolute decrease of 8 mg/d is clinically relevant 
compared to 2.5 mg/d for placebo. Furthermore, a final dose ≤ 5mg/d (considered a clinically meaningful 
objective) was achieved by 61% and 59% of the patients in the benralizumab arms (Q4W and Q8W, 
respectively) vs 33% in the placebo arm (p ≤ 0.002). Finally, the sparing effect was maintained for at 
least 3 additional months of treatment in the extension trial. 
In contrast to the results of the exacerbation studies, the reduction in the frequency of exacerbations by 
70% with benralizumab Q8W and 55% with benralizumab Q4W (from an annualised rate of 1.80/year) is 
considered important especially since the OCS dose was reduced in parallel. 
Safety profile 
The toxicity of benralizumab is very low with  few ADRs identified at present. Despite its observed 
immunogenicity, hypersensitivity reactions did not occur more frequently than on placebo. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Despite its dramatic effect on blood eosinophils benralizumab has demonstrated a modest effect on the 
frequency of exacerbations as reflected in relative terms by a ~40% reduction in the annual exacerbation 
rate and in absolute terms by a difference of about 0.5/year from 1.14 to 0.66/year. It is noteworthy that 
in similar patient populations, the two other anti-IL-5 agents (mepolizumab and reslizumab) achieved 
reductions in asthma exacerbations rates greater than 50% from a level of ~1.80/year. 
Regarding the other benefits of benralizumab, a clinically relevant improvement in lung function was 
demonstrated by an increase in FEV1 ≥ 100 mL compared to placebo. While the benefits in terms of 
asthma symptoms, asthma control and quality of life are considered small or marginal, the interpretation 
of the PRO outcomes is difficult in this clinical setting (patients with severe asthma treated with a 
combination of high ICS dose and LABA), as reflected by similar results for previously authorised anti-IL5 
products. 
In more severe patients receiving chronic OCS therapy, benralizumab has shown a clinically meaningful 
OCS sparing effect associated with an important reduction (> 50%) in the frequency of asthma 
exacerbation despite reduction in OCS dose. 
Overall, the extent of the effect  of benralizumab is considered moderate but the benefit  outweigh the 
risks of this treatment given its low toxicity as shown in the clinical trials. Therefore, the benefit/risk 
balance is considered positive in the studied population. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance  
Like with the other authorised anti-IL-5 agents, the benefits of therapy have been shown to increase with 
increasing frequency of exacerbations and baseline blood eosinophil count. In the subpopulation of 
patients with 2 exacerbations in the previous year, where the placebo annual exacerbation rate was ≤1, 
there was little difference in the outcomes according to baseline blood eosinophil count and the treatment 
Assessment report

effect was minimal: AER reduction by 25-35% and marginal increase in mean pre-bronchodilator FEV1 
(13-105 mL).  
In contrast, in the subpopulation of patients with ≥ 3 exacerbations in the previous year, where the 
placebo annual exacerbation rate was about 2, patients with higher baseline blood eosinophil count 
(≥300/µL) fared better than those with lower baseline count: AER reduction by ~50% vs ~30%, 
respectively, and increase in mean pre-bronchodilator FEV1 of 121 mL (Q4W) and 252 mL (Q8W) vs. 33 
mL (Q4W) and 75 mL (Q8W), respectively. 
In conclusion, the benefit of benralizumab, especially with the Q8W regimen, is demonstrated in patients 
with a high frequency of asthma exacerbations and high baseline blood eosinophil count. However, in 
those with a low frequency of exacerbations, the benefit is extremely modest, if not marginal, regardless 
of their baseline blood eosinophil count. 
Notwithstanding, it is not considered appropriate to restrict the indication based on the above risk factors 
(baseline blood eosinophil count, frequency of exacerbations). This information is described in Section 5.1 
of the SmPC in line with the SmPC of the two other anti-IL-5 products. 
Despite a certain degree of correlation between benralizumab effects and blood eosinophil levels at 
baseline, their levels during treatment appear to be poorly correlated with the frequency of exacerbations 
and the pulmonary function. This is especially striking in a very limited number of patients with high titre 
neutralising ADAs, who exhibited undetectable drug concentrations and blood eosinophil levels in the 
range of their pre-treatment levels but reported 0 or 1 asthma exacerbation over a two-year follow-up. 
Further long-term data will be provided from the extension trials as part of the RMP. Nevertheless, 
pursuing the administration of benralizumab should be reconsidered in individual patients where blood 
eosinophil counts return to pre-treatment levels. 
3.8.  Conclusion 
The overall B/R of benralizumab is positive as add on maintenance therapy in adult patients with severe 
eosinophilic asthma inadequately controlled despite high dose of corticosteroid plus long-acting 
β-agonist. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the risk-benefit balance of Fasenra is favourable in the following indication: 
Fasenra is indicated as an add-on maintenance treatment in adult patients with severe eosinophilic 
asthma inadequately controlled despite high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting β-agonists.

congenital factor XIII A-subunit deficiency, and as 
supplementary treatment to management of 
breakthrough bleeding episodes during regular 
prophylactic treatment regimen in patients with

SmPC, Annex 
The MAH updated the SmPC: 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
II, Labelling 
- Section 4.4 to reflect that on-demand treatment was used 
data 
and PL 
in the extension study F13CD-3720: 
The on-demand treatment of acute bleeds or breakthrough 
bleeds with NovoThirteen was allowed per protocol in the 
late phase clinical development programme. One patient 
was treated on demand in a phase 3b extension study 
(F13CD-3720). Also, on-demand treatment is followed in a 
non-interventional post-authorisation safety study 
(NN1841-3868). Until further results are available, 
alternative treatment should be considered in such 
situations. 
- Section 5.1 to update the bleeding rate:  
In the F13CD-1725 extension trial F13CD-3720, the age-
adjusted rate of bleeds that required treatment with a 
FXIII-containing product was estimated to be 0.021 bleeds 
per subject year with a 95% CI of [0.0062; 0.073] (model-
based estimate corresponding to a mean age of the trial 
population of 31.0 years).  
The crude bleeding rate in the two trials, F13CD-1725 and 
F13CD-3720, not adjusted for age, were 0.138 and 0.043 
respectively, corresponding to a total of 13 bleeds over 223 
subject-years and a pooled rate of 0.058.  
- Section 5.2 to update the half-life:  
The half-life of NovoThirteen was assessed in the F13CD-
1725 trial from a limited blood sampling scheme at 1 hour, 
14 and 28 days post dose. Based on FXIII activity 
measured by the Berichrom assay in patients with 
congenital FXIII deficiency, a geometric mean half-life of 
11.8 days was estimated.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The initially claimed indication was: “TRODELVY is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
unresectable locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) who have received at 
least two prior therapies, including at least one prior therapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease.” 
Following recommendation by the CHMP the applicant agreed to a revised indication wording: 
Trodelvy as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic 
triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) who have received two or more prior systemic therapies, including at 
least one of them for advanced disease (see section 5.1). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), accounts for approximately 15% of invasive breast cancers [DeSantis 
et al, 2016; Plasilova et al, 2016; Kohler et al, 2015]. TNBC is more common in younger women than in older 
women and in black persons than in persons of other races and ethnic groups. Other risk factors for the 
disease include the presence of a breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA) mutation, premenopausal status, 
obesity, and maternal-related factors such as parity and age at first pregnancy [Trivers et al, 2009; Plasilova 
et al, 2016] 
2.1.3.  Biologic features Aetiology and pathogenesis 
TNBC is defined by a lack of tumor-cell expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), 
and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) [Anders et al, 2013]. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis 
TNBC is associated with aggressive tumour biology and a poor prognosis. TNBC is often associated with 
visceral metastases and mTNBC is incurable [Kassam et al, 2009]. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Targeted therapies have benefited patients with other subtypes of breast cancer and several targeted 
therapies for hormone receptor positive (HR+) and HER2-positive breast cancer are available; however, 
sequential single-agent chemotherapy remains the standard of care for patients with mTNBC [Cardoso et al, 
Assessment report  
EMA/623887/2021 
Page 9/159 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2020]. There is no preferred or standard regimen used and in general, patients first receive standard 
chemotherapy regimens that include either a taxane and/or anthracycline. 
However, a majority of patients have disease progression after receiving first-line therapy and standard 
therapeutic options are limited to chemotherapy (eg, capecitabine, gemcitabine, vinorelbine or albumin-
bound paclitaxel, and combination regimens for patients who present with visceral crisis). Standard 
chemotherapy is associated with low response rates (10 to 15%) and short progression-free survival (PFS) (2 
to 3 months) among patients with pretreated mTNBC [Brufsky et al, 2012; Perez et al, 2010; Twelves et al, 
2016; Park et al, 2019]. Overall survival (OS) among patients with this form of breast cancer has not 
changed over the past 20 years and patients with mTNBC continue to have a considerably worse OS when 
compared with their metastatic breast cancer counterparts [Zeichner et al, 2016].  
For patients whose tumours are programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) positive, atezolizumab in combination 
with nab-paclitaxel has been approved for mTNBC while the poly-adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase 
inhibitors (PARPi), olaparib and talazoparib, have been approved for patients with TNBC who harbour a 
germline BRCA 1 or 2 mutation and have been previously treated with chemotherapy. 
Treatment options are limited for patients who have received 2 or more regimens in the metastatic setting, 
highlighting the need for advances in therapeutic options for these patients. 
About the product 
Sacituzumab govitecan (hereafter referred to as SG) is a trophoblast cell surface antigen-2 (Trop-2)-directed 
antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate (ie, an antibody-drug conjugate) composed of the following 3 
components: 
1.  The humanised monoclonal antibody, hRS7 IgG1κ, that binds to Trop-2, a transmembrane calcium 
signal transducer that is overexpressed in many epithelial cancers, including triple-negative breast 
cancer (TNBC) 
2.  The camptothecin-derived agent, SN-38, a topoisomerase I inhibitor 
3.  A hydrolyzable linker, with the company designation as CL2A, which links the humanised monoclonal 
antibody to SN-38. 
Binding of Trop-2 by the parental RS7 antibody has been shown to result in internalisation and processing of 
the antibody by the targeted cells [Shih et al, 1994; Stein et al, 1995]. Because of its hydrolyzable linker, SG 
will release its SN-38 payload both intra- and extra-cellularly in the tumor microenvironment [Govindan et al, 
2013; Goldenberg et al, 2015]. SG delivers significantly greater amounts of SN-38 to a Trop-2-expressing 
tumor than conventional irinotecan chemotherapy [Sharkey et al, 2015]. The extracellular release of SN-38 
from SG also allows for by-stander killing of Trop-2 negative tumor cells [Lopez et al, 2020; Perrone et al, 
2020; Zeybek et al, 2020]. 
Thus, SG can deliver cytotoxic chemotherapy to tumors, including adjacent cancer cells, in concentrations 
that are higher than those with standard chemotherapy and may reduce toxic effects in normal tissues that 
do not express the target. 
SG belongs to the Anatomic Therapeutic Class 1 of antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents. 
Assessment report  
EMA/623887/2021 
Page 10/159 
 
 
 
 
The claimed indication for SG is for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic TNBC who have received 
at least 2 prior therapies for metastatic disease. SG for injection is a powder for intravenous (IV) use in a 50 
mL clear glass single-dose vial that delivers 200 mg SG each. The recommended dose of SG is 10 mg/kg 
administered as an IV infusion once weekly on Days 1 and 8 of 21-day treatment cycles. SG treatment is to 
be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was considered 
to be of major public health interest. This was based on the provided Phase III study data which 
demonstrated a clinically meaningful improvement in progression free and overall survival compared to 
physician´s choice of SOC chemotherapy. Sacituzumab govitecan was considered to have the potential to 
fulfil the unmet medical need in the sought patient population.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Sacituzumab govitecan, the active substance contained in Trodelvy, is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). 
Sacituzumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody (hRS7 IgG1κ) produced from a Sp2/0 cell line and 
recognises Trop-2. The small molecule, SN38, is a topoisomerase I inhibitor which is covalently attached to 
the antibody by a hydrolysable linker, CL2A.   
Trodelvy is presented as 200 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion in a vial. It is formulated 
with 2-(N-morpholino)ethane sulfonic acid (MES) monohydrate (novel excipient), polysorbate 80 and 
trehalose dihydrate. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The quality of sacituzumab, CL2A-SN38 and sacituzumab govitecan is described in separate sections: 
- Sacituzumab intermediate (hRS7 IgG1κ); 
- CL2A-SN38 drug-linker intermediate; 
- Sacituzumab govitecan active substance. 
2.2.2.1. Sacituzumab intermediate (hRS7 IgG1κ) 
General Information 
hRS7 IgG1κ is a recombinant heterotetrameric humanised mouse IgG1 monoclonal antibody with two kappa 
light chains and two gamma one heavy chains. There is one N-glycosylation site on the heavy chain (301) 
and it is predominantly occupied with a core fucosylated bi-antennary glycan, typically found with monoclonal 
antibodies produced by Sp2/0 murine myeloma cells, with 0, 1 or 2 terminal galactose residues.

Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
Description of the manufacturing process and process controls 
The monoclonal antibody intermediate is manufactured in accordance with EU GMP.  
hRS7 IgG1κ antibody intermediate (hRS7 IgG1κ) is manufactured from a Sp2/0-AG14 cell line using a fed-
batch bioreactor process, consisting of thaw and inoculum expansion, cell culture expansion and production in 
a bioreactor, followed by harvest. The intact IgG is purified from the cell culture broth by a series of column 
chromatography and filtration steps.  
Thaw and inoculum expansion are described in sufficient detail and appropriate process parameters and in-
process controls (IPCs) are in place. Production and harvest process have been thoroughly described. Fill 
weight is controlled. The purification process has been adequately described, including the sanitisation 
procedures. Resin lifetime has been identified as a key operational parameter (KOP), with a pre-determined 
number of cycles. An overview of the process control strategy has been provided, where the process 
parameters and in-process controls have been described. In process hold times have been validated by 
studying the chemical stability and microbial control of media holds performed on the specific storage 
vessels. Antibody intermediate bulk solution is shipped for manufacturing of sacituzumab govitecan bulk 
active substance. 
The description of the manufacturing process and process controls are considered acceptable. 
Control of materials 
Compendial and non-compendial raw materials, disposable equipment, resins and filters are listed. 
Certificates of analysis for all incoming materials are reviewed to ensure they comply with the manufacturer 
specifications. Additional testing is performed on specific raw materials. In-house specifications for raw 
materials were provided.  
Sufficient information on the gene construct and cell line is provided. A conventional two-tiered cell banking 
system of master cell bank (MCB) and working cell bank (WCB) has been established. Cell bank 
manufacturing and storage is described. The cell banks have been characterised and tested. The generation 
and qualification of the WCB is described. The limit of in vitro cell age (LIVCA) is established as of total in 
vitro age from the MCB, given the harvest from a production run after thaw of the WCB and of additional 
culture, included in the manufacture of the WCB. The acceptability of a LIVCA from the MCB is supported by 
all data generated for the upstream process performance and product quality, and also genetic stability data. 
Control of materials is considered acceptable.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
An overview of the process parameters and IPCs of the antibody intermediate manufacturing process was 
presented. Steps with CPPs and/or critical IPCs are considered the critical steps. CPPs impacting critical 
quality attributes (CQAs) are defined for the manufacturing process. It is indicated which in-process tests are 
to adjust the process and which are related to product quality/or process performance indicators. Target 
range and acceptable range are provided. A strategy is in place to manage excursions from acceptable ranges 
and excursion actions based upon parameter criticality are clarified. This is acceptable. 
Process validation 
A lifecycle approach has been used for validation of the commercial manufacturing process of hRS7 IgG1κ; 
Process Design, Process Verification (also referred to as PPQ) and ongoing process verification. These batches 
Assessment report  
EMA/623887/2021 
Page 12/159 
 
 
 
were manufactured under a pre-approved protocol and acceptance criteria to show that the manufacturing 
process can consistently produce product meeting quality criteria. The performance parameter results 
obtained during process validation demonstrate that the cell culture and purification processes are under 
control and can be considered successfully validated. Deviations to the PPQ protocol are described in 
sufficient detail and were determined not to adversely affect the product or the process, and therefore not to 
impact the PPQ. Commercial scale process equipment cleaning validation was successfully executed with no 
process deviations. 
The commercial process for the manufacture of hRS7 IgG1κis considered validated. 
The applicant follows a comprehensive control strategy linking the control provided by each unit operation 
with control provided by raw materials, procedural elements, environmental factors, process parameters, in-
process and release testing and stability monitoring.  
Characterisation  
An exhaustive characterisation exercise was performed that include determination of the primary, secondary 
and tertiary structures, glycosylation profile analysis, purity and biological activity studies. Overall, the 
methods used are considered adequate for their intended use. 
To control process-derived impurities, the applicant follows a strategy based on risk assessments, release 
testing and capacity of the purification process to efficiently remove impurities to acceptable levels. Overall, 
this is considered adequate.  
Overall, characterisation of hRS7 IgG1κ is considered acceptable. 
Specifications 
Specifications for the hRS7 IgG1κ monoclonal antibody intermediate include control of identity, purity and 
impurities, potency and other general tests.  
The applicant has justified the ranges of acceptance criteria for each quality attribute included in the 
sacituzumab specification. The acceptance criteria reflect the results of characterisation, stability and 
variability in the analytical results. The proposed acceptance criteria ensure that all variants are controlled to 
levels that do not affect biological activity or safety. The specifications take into account the fact that hRS7 
IgG1κ is an intermediate and also additional controls are in place for sacituzumab govitecan. The 
specifications for hRS7 IgG1κ are considered acceptable. 
The applicant states that specifications will be re-evaluated after enough commercial lots are manufactured 
to provide statistical power for robust analyses. This is considered adequate.  
Analytical methods 
Descriptions of non-compendial methods are provided by the applicant. The methods were validated in 
accordance with ICH guideline for specificity, accuracy, repeatability, intermediate precision, linearity, range, 
and robustness. Results indicate that the methods are suitable for release purposes.  
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data is provided for commercial scale batches produced and the PPQ batches. All results are 
within the set specification at the time of release. Batches manufactured according to the commercial process 
demonstrate consistency of the manufacturing process. Supportive batch analysis data is provided.

Manufacturing process development.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The review of process parameters and operating ranges concluded that appropriate process monitoring, and 
process control mechanisms have been designed into the manufacturing process to ensure production of 
CL2A-SN38 of acceptable quality. In addition to the quality control of the starting materials and key reagents, 
these mechanisms include the incorporation of IPC tests and processing instructions that define actions to 
take based upon observations during batch production.

validation information is required for this intermediate. Only shipment conditions have been adequately 
validated. The results have been presented. 
Manufacturing process development 
The history of manufacturing process development provides enough details and summarises the main 
changes during the process development. The control strategy was established based on a combination of 
risk-assessment and use of Design of Experiments (DoE) to characterise each major stage in the 
manufacture of CL2A-SN38.  
Characterisation

A retest period is justified based on the stability data reported. 
2.2.2.3. Sacituzumab govitecan  
General Information 
Sacituzumab govitecan (Figure 2) results from the conjugation via thioether bonds of the following 
intermediates: 
- Sacituzumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody (hRS7 IgG1κ); 
- CL2A-SN38, a drug linker comprised of SN-38, a camptothecin-derived agent (topoisomerase I inhibitor) 
and CL2A, a hydrolysable linker. 
Binding of Trop-2 by the parental hRS7 antibody has been shown to result in the internalisation and 
processing of the antibody by the targeted cells. Because of its hydrolysable linker, the active substance will 
release its SN38 payload both intra- and extra-cellularly in the tumour microenvironment.  The extracellular 
release of SN-38 also allows for by-stander killing of Trop-2 negative tumour cells. 
The ADC has an average molar drug to antibody ratio (DAR) of approximately 7 to 8 drug molecules per 
antibody, and a molecular weight of approximately 160 kDa.

Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
Description of the manufacturing process and process controls  
Sacituzumab govitecan is manufactured at BSP Pharmaceuticals S.p.A., Italy by a straightforward process.  
Control of materials 
The raw materials, solvents, and reagents used for conjugation and purification of sacituzumab govitecan are 
provided. For non-compendial raw materials, quality standards are provided.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The quantity of the antibody and the CL2A-SN38 used in the conjugation is controlled as a process input in 
the master batch record. The microbial control strategy is deemed acceptable considering the limits set for 
IPCs and release of sacituzumab govitecan active substance.  
Manufacturing steps having a significant impact on CQAs or have essential roles in controlling CQAs need to 
be controlled. Steps with CPPs and/or critical IPCs are considered the critical steps.  
Process validation 
The sacituzumab govitecan active substance process validation strategy was designed to demonstrate that 
the commercial process is capable of consistently delivering active substance with the required quality. The 
process validation strategy included consecutive PPQ batches of active substance, manufactured according to 
the commercial process. The process performance parameter results obtained during process qualification 
demonstrate that the active substance manufacturing process consistently meets criteria for process 
performance and product quality specifications for active substance. Ongoing process verification will be 
followed in stage 3, to monitor the process in order to assure that the process remains in a state of control 
during commercial manufacture, in compliance with the validated parameters. 
Information on the history of the manufacturing process is described, including development of the linker, 
scale-up and early development of the manufacturing process. The control strategy for the active 
Assessment report  
EMA/623887/2021 
Page 17/159 
 
 
 
 
 
manufacturing process is composed of a variety of elements including raw material controls, procedural and 
environmental controls, process parameter controls, in-process controls, release testing, stability testing and 
process validation. Combinations of these control elements are applied, as appropriate, to provide a high 
degree of assurance that the defined properties for the CQAs are achieved. The integrated strategy for 
control of sacituzumab govitecan active substance was developed by assessing the criticality of product 
quality attributes and ranking the process variables based on risk to CQAs and process consistency. Each 
quality attribute was rated for criticality using a risk assessment tool that evaluates severity of impact and 
the uncertainty of this evaluation. The outcome of the sacituzumab govitecan active substance CQA risk 
assessment is considered adequate. The medium and high-risk quality attributes were conservatively 
categorised as CQAs. To rank the process variables based on their risk to impact CQAs and process 
consistency, a process capability risk assessment was performed and each parameter of the various unit 
operations was evaluated for their impact in a FMEA. The Risk Priority Numbers (RPNs) were calculated 
considering the severity, occurrence and detectability rankings. High and medium Risk parameters were 
identified as potential CPPs and a risk mitigation strategy was defined, and validation studies, adjustments to 
master batch records, or control strategies were implemented. The presented overall control strategy is 
deemed acceptable.  
In the context of process characterisation, a series of DoE experiments were performed to identify or confirm 
the appropriate setpoints and operating ranges for key or critical process parameters. Sacituzumab govitecan 
has been evaluated in the pivotal IMMU-132-01 Phase I/II and in the confirmatory Phase III ASCENT clinical 
trials.  
Characterisation  
Elucidation of structure 
The active substance has been adequately characterised. The reduction method has consistently resulted in 8 
sulfhydryl groups derived from the four inter-chain disulfide bridges, while intra-domain disulfides if reduced 
are expected to refold due to their juxtaposition within the Ig-fold. This is supported by peptide mapping 
showing that 99% of the attached payload is coupled specifically to the 8 sulfhydryl groups involved in 
interchain disulfide bridges. Occupancy at non-specific sites is low (<1%). 
Impurities 
Different sources of potential impurities in sacituzumab govitecan were considered, including impurities 
originating from raw materials, solvents and reagents used in the manufacturing processes, as well as 
product-related impurities. Process-related impurities are introduced into the active substance process either 
directly or from the antibody and CL2A-SN38. Elemental impurities have been determined.  
Specification 
Specifications have been set as per ICH Q6A and ICH Q6B and include control of identity, purity and 
impurities, potency and other general tests.  
Assays have been developed for monitoring the biological activity of sacituzumab govitecan. Justification for 
the specification is based on an assessment of the variability in the analytical results obtained for each 
specification.  
The control strategy is appropriate and characteristics identified by risk analysis are largely covered. 
Reference to Ph. Eur. and internal method identification number is provided.

Analytical methods 
The non-compendial analytical procedures have been validated in accordance with ICH and found suitable for 
their intended purposes. The methods have been demonstrated to be fit for purpose.  
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data for sacituzumab govitecan active substance manufactured with the different processes 
are provided. Batches were tested by the methods valid at time of release and the acceptance criteria were 
met. The data support consistency of the material.

Refer to the finished product section.  
Container closure  
Suitability of the container closure system for the active substance is supported by stability data.  
Stability 
No trends were observed in any of the parameters tested for the duration of the study under long-term 
conditions. The proposed shelf life is further supported by prediction modelling of long term data, by stability 
data under accelerated conditions of batches.  
The applicant provided appropriate a commitment that commercial stability studies for sacituzumab govitecan 
bulk active substance will be completed as per the protocol. Any confirmed out-of-specification result, or 
significant negative trend, should be reported to EMA. In addition, one batch of sacituzumab govitecan bulk 
active substance will be placed on stability annually.  
The active substance was subjected to various stress conditions of thermal, low and high pH, oxidative 
stress, and photo stress.

polysorbate 80 (stabiliser/surfactant), and a novel excipient 2-(N-morpholino)ethane sulfonic acid (MES) 
hydrate, pH 6.5 (buffer). 
The formulation was developed to minimise in-process (bulk active substance and finished product) 
degradation, facilitate lyophilisation, ensure acceptable finished product stability, and provide suitable in-use 
stability and handling properties.  
Pharmaceutical development 
The comprehensive control strategy links the control provided by each unit operation with control provided by 
raw materials, procedural elements, environmental factors, process parameters, in-process and release 
testing and stability monitoring. 
The critical process steps and process parameters for the finished product manufacturing have been identified 
through design space studies and accumulated manufacturing experience.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacture 
Sacituzumab govitecan finished product is manufactured and tested for release.

Analytical methods 
The analytical methods description is adequate and descriptions are presented for non-compendial analytical 
methods exclusively applied to the finished product, including the preparation of samples for analysis, the 
conditions of analysis and the calculation formulas. Compendial analytical procedures follow the current 
edition of the referenced pharmacopeia and reference to the corresponding monograph is provided. All 
compendial methods used for active substance and finished product testing were successfully verified.  
A detailed risk assessment according to ICH Q3D (R1) was conducted in relation to the potential presence of 
elemental impurities in the finished product, using component assessment approach for all phases of 
production, from conjugation to filling along with excipients. Given the “low” overall risk, as described in the 
ICH Q3D, the absence of additional controls is found acceptable.  
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been 
provided, considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for 
marketing authorisation holders/Applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the 
“Assessment report - Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004 - Nitrosamine impurities 
in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020).  
The risk of the presence of nitrosamine impurities in Trodelvy from the chemically synthesised linker CL2A-
SN38, from the raw materials used in the biological components of Trodelvy and from the primary packaging 
materials was assessed.  
Based on the information provided, it is accepted that no risk was identified on the possible presence of 
nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or finished product. Therefore, no additional control measures 
are deemed necessary. 
Batch analysis 
Sacituzumab govitecan finished product batch analysis data are provided. The presented data support 
consistency of the Process C finished product.  
Reference standard 
Reference standard used for finished product testing is the same as for the active substance. 
A two-tiered reference standard programme (primary and working reference standards) has been established 
from lots representative of production and clinical materials to ensure consistency and continuity of the active 
substance and finished product quality. Qualification data was provided. A requalification protocol based on 
pre-specified criteria was provided. 
Container closure 
The primary packaging components, Type I colourless, clear glass 50-mL vial and 20-mm elastomeric stopper 
meet Ph. Eur. compendial requirements for glass containers for pharmaceutical use and elastomeric closures 
for injection.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical package submitted contains in total 13 studies on primary and secondary pharmacodynamics 
pharmacology, 1 study in safety pharmacology, 7 studies in pharmacokinetics and 8 toxicology studies. Primary 
pharmacology  was  tested  in  murine  xenograft  models  bearing  human  Trop-2  expressing  tumors. 
Pharmacokinetic  and  toxicity  studies  were  also  conducted  in  mice  and  /  or  rabbits  to  evaluate  Trop-2-
independent  (off-target)  PK,  biodistribution  or  toxicity.  Cynomolgus  monkeys  were  identified  as  the  only 
relevant toxicity species due to cross-reactivity of the target, Trop-2 with the hRS7antibody, the binding moiety 
of sacituzumab govitecan. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (Trop-2) is a member of the epithelial cell adhesion molecule family, that is 
expressed on healthy epithelial cells in many organs and described to be overexpressed in a number of 
carcinomas. Expression of Trop-2 by various human cancer cell lines was demonstrated in vitro by flow 
cytometry analysis. Across the different cell lines analysed, Trop-2 expression levels varied but did not 
correlate with the tumour type. Relevant to the present marketing authorisation application, Trop-2 was 
expressed by different human breast cancer lines, including triple-negative breast cancer.  
In binding affinity studies ([RR 01-15-10], [RR 01-17-14]) Sacituzumab govitecan was shown to bind to 
human Trop-2-expressing tumour cells (KD 0.658 ± 0.14 nM) and to recombinant human Trop-2 (KD 0.26 ± 
0.14 nM). The binding affinity of the ADC was comparable to that of mAb hRS7, indicating that conjugation 
with SN-38 did not impair binding to the target antigen Trop-2 (study RR 05-07-12). In addition, 
sacituzumab govitecan was shown to be cytotoxic for Trop-2 positive tumour cells in vitro while the un-
conjugated mAb hRS7 did not inhibit tumour cell growth (RR 01-15-10; Cardillo et al., 2011).  
Across the different cancer cell lines evaluated, the EC50 for cytotoxicity induced by sacituzumab govitecan 
(based on SN-38 equivalents) ranged from 1.95 nM to 23.14 nM. It is noted that the EC50 did not strictly 
correlate with the Trop-2 expression level of the target cells. When compared to free SN-38, the ADC was 
slightly less active (1.4 - 2.8x).

Table 1 Susceptibility of cancer cell lines to sacituzumab govitecan (Cardillo et al., 2011) 
Treatment of Trop-2-positive tumour cells with sacituzumab govitecan resulted in an increase of DNA double-
strand breaks as evidenced by the increase in phosphorylated histone H2AX. Induction of DNA double-strand 
breaks due to inhibition of topoisomerase I is a known mode of action for SN-38, the active metabolite of 
irinotecan. Furthermore, the apoptotic pathway induced by sacituzumab govitecan was consistent with that of 
free SN-38 (Goldenberg et al., 2015). 
In vivo pharmacology of sacituzumab govitecan was evaluated in murine xenograft models of human lung, 
colorectal, pancreatic cancers and gastric cancers. In these studies, treatment with sacituzumab govitecan 
either stopped tumour growth or resulted in reduction of tumour volume. In general, the ADC was more 
efficacious in tumour growth inhibition than irinotecan at the same SN-38 dose (Cardillo et al., 2011; 2015).  
More relevant to the present MAA, sacituzumab govitecan also showed anti-tumour activity in mice bearing 
TNBC xenografts (study 022714-218). Four IV doses of sacituzumab govitecan at 7.5 and 12.5 mg/kg 
given over a 2-week period led to a clear reduction in growth of TNBC cells. At the lower sacituzumab 
govitecan dose, a cumulative dose of 9.6 µg SN-38-equivalents were administered. In contrast, irinotecan 
treatment, resulting in a cumulative dose of 600 µg SN-38, did not achieve a persistent reduction in tumour 
volume. In this group, tumour progression was observed earlier than in the sacituzumab govitecan-treated 
groups.

Figure 3 Therapeutic efficacy of sacituzumab govitecan (IMMU-132) in a TNBC xenograft model (study 
022714-218). 
Together the xenograft studies provide evidence that specific targeting of SN-38 to the tumour is more 
effective than a larger dose of the untargeted toxin. 
In study 120415-337 the efficacy of sacituzumab govitecan produced from two sources (clones 8F6 used in 
phase I/II studies vs clone 80-36-35 used in Phase 3 studies) was compared in a human TNBC xenograft 
model. The anti-tumour effects induced by sacituzumab govitecan from the two sources were not significantly 
different with regard to inhibition of tumour growth and survival 
Species cross-reactivity 
Reactivity of mAb hRS7 with Trop-2 from non-clinical species was evaluated by ELISA. Despite approx. 80% 
sequence homology at the protein level between human and rodent Trop-2, hRS7 did not bind to mouse and 
rat Trop-2. In contrast, mAb hRS7 and also the ADC sacituzumab govitecan bound with comparable affinity to 
human and rhesus monkey Trop-2. Given that rhesus and cynomolgus Trop-2 have an identical amino acid 
sequence, these data support the use of cynomolgus monkeys for the non-clinical safety assessment of hRS7 
and sacituzumab govitecan (studies rr-08-27-13; rr-01-apr-2019; rr-25-nov-2020). 
Tissue cross-reactivity of hRS7 was evaluated with cynomolgus and human tissues in GLP studies IM1735 
and DMP 0411. In both studies hRS7 stained epithelial cells in a number of different tissues; staining was 
mostly cytoplasmic but membrane staining was also observed for selected tissues. It is noted that more 
tissues stained positive in cynomolgus than in humans while staining of liver bile ducts and pituitary gland 
was observed in human but not in cynomolgus tissues. The cynomolgus study also identified hRS7 staining in 
tissue elements that were not previously reported to express Trop-2 (few epithelial cell types, myoepithelium, 
mesothelium and decidual cells). To what extent this staining represents previously unreported sites of Trop-
2 expression or cross-reactivity with another closely related epitope(s) is not known.

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The ability of the non-conjugated mAb hRS7 to induce cytotoxic activity against Trop-2-expressing cancer 
cells was evaluated in vitro in study RR-06-10-11. Incubation of cancer cells with hRS7 (0.078 to 2 µg/ml)  
did not result in any signs of growth inhibition against any of the cell lines tested. The addition of a cross-
linking antibody did not cause any observable growth inhibition in these lines either. 
Evaluation of other secondary pharmacologic effects is performed as part of the primary pharmacology 
studies.  
These studies assessed the Fc functionality of sacituzumab govitecan and the binding to FcRn.  
As an IgG1 molecule, sacituzumab govitecan can interact with Fcγ receptors and may induce Fc-dependent 
effector functions. Thus, the potential of hRS7 and sacituzumab govitecan to induce ADCC and CDC was 
assessed in vitro in studies TR-PD-IMMU-132-17-017 and TR-PD-IMMU-132-17-018. The non-conjugated 
mAb hRS7 induced ADCC against Trop-2 expressing tumour cell lines with a specific lysis up to approx. 30%. 
The % specific lysis mediated by sacituzumab govitecan was lower. Neither hRS7 nor sacituzumab govitecan 
induced CDC. Together these data suggest that Fc-dependent effector functions to not contribute significantly 
to the anti-tumour activity of sacituzumab govitecan. 
Binding affinity of sacituzumab govitecan to FcRn at pH 6.0 ranged from 138.2 to 228.8 nM, and was 1.5-2.6 
times lower than affinity of the non-conjugated mAb hRS7. This lower affinity may contribute to the short 
half-life of sacituzumab govitecan in cancer patients (study RR 05-07-12). 
Safety pharmacology programme 
An in vitro human ether-à-go-go related gene (hERG) assay was not conducted with sacituzumab govitecan. 
This is acceptable since hERG testing is not typically required for biologicals with large molecular weight.  
Based on the results from evaluation of safety pharmacology parameters in the two repeat-dose toxicity 
studies in cynomolgus monkeys (12.5, 25, 50 mg/kg (study SNBL.160.25); 60, 120 mg/kg (study 
SNBL.160.03), there were no apparent adverse effects on the CNS, the cardiovascular system including 
assessment of QT or corrected QT (QTc) interval or respiratory function following intravenous dosing of 
sacituzumab govitecan in cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to 120 mg/kg. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies of sacituzumab govitecan have not been performed. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic studies of sacituzumab govitecan comprised the in vitro assessment of its stability in human 
and cynomolgus serum, a study in mice comparing PK of sacituzumab govitecan and hRS7, a study in 
rabbits, comparing the PK of hRS7 manufactured according different processes and two toxicokinetic studies

in cynomolgus monkeys. In addition, studies in tumour-bearing mice evaluated biodistribution of radio-
labelled sacituzumab govitecan vs. hRS7 and kinetics of sacituzumab govitecan vs. irinotecan. 
Bioanalytical methods 
Two sets of bioanalytical methods were used, research methods and GLP-compliant methods. The pivotal, 3-
months-repeat-dose GLP-compliant toxicity study in monkeys utilised validated, GLP-compliant LC-MS/MS 
and electroluminescence assays for the PK and immunogenicity assessments. All other studies used non-GLP 
bioanalytical methods.  
Four analytes were measured to characterize the pharmacokinetics of the ADC: 1) total antibody (hRS7-SN-
38, DAR ≥ 0), 2) free SN-38 (cytotoxic payload), 3) SN-38 glucuronide (SN-38G, metabolite of SN-38) and 
total SN38 (free SN-38 + hRS7-SN-38). Additional quantification of the ADC (rather than total Ab) would 
have been welcomed. However, it is acknowledged that an assay that detects only the ADC (based on 
capture with anti-SN-38 and detection with anti-hRS7) would not provide evidence on the number of SN-38 
molecules linked the ADC. Given the hydrolysable linker, the drug antibody ratio will be highly variable in vivo 
over time for individual sacituzumab govitecan molecules. Thus, total SN-38 better reflects exposure to the 
payload.  
Absorption: 
Stability of sacituzumab govitecan in human and monkey serum was determined in vitro in study RD-CH-20-
1020-01. The half-life of SN-38 release from sacituzumab govitecan in vitro (at 37°C, 5% CO2) was 30.82 hrs 
in cynomolgus serum and 44.1 hrs in human serum. Results from this study are roughly in line with results 
published by Goldenberg et al. (2015), which reported a half-life of 22.9 hrs in monkey serum and of 23.98 
hrs in human serum. In murine serum, the half-life of SN-38 release from sacituzumab govitecan at 37°C in 
vitro was calculated to be 17.5 hrs. Together these data demonstrate that SN-38 is released from the ADC 
even without up-take into a Trop-2-expressing target cell which is an intended property of sacituzumab 
govitecan. 
In study SNBL.160.24 pharmacokinetics of sacituzumab govitecan and hRS7 after a single IV administration 
(200 µg/dose; 10 mg/kg) were compared in SW mice. Since hRS7 does not bind to Trop-2 from these 
species, the study provides information on target-independent kinetics only. When serum concentrations 
were determined based on the Ab moiety, the PK of the unconjugated hRS7 and sacituzumab govitecan were 
comparable with a β-elimination half-life of approx. 200 hrs and a MRT of approx. 300 hrs. In contrast, 
clearance of the intact ADC was much faster (approx. 8x). This finding indicates that the toxin moiety is 
cleaved from the ADC in vivo even in the absence of Trop-2 binding and is consistent with the data on serum 
stability of sacituzumab govitecan in vitro.  
Toxicokinetics of sacituzumab govitecan and its metabolites after repeat dosing were assessed in cynomolgus 
monkeys in study SNBL.160.03. Since hRS7 binds to cynomolgus Trop-2, these studies reflect both target-
dependent and -independent kinetics. After 2 IV doses of sacituzumab govitecan given 3 days apart, kinetics 
of total Ab were typical for a mAb; Cmax was reached shortly after the second IV administration; the 
elimination half-life was 5.2 days. With regard to the toxin moiety, exposure (Cmax, AUCinf) to total SN-38 was 
greater than exposure to free SN-38 while the half-life of free SN-38 was approx. 2x as long as the half-life 
of total SN-38.  
In study SNBL.160.25, cynomolgus monkeys were treated with sacituzumab govitecan at 12.5, 25 and 50 
mg/kg IV in 4 treatment cycles of 21 days with treatment on days 1 and 8 of the cycle. Exposure to total Ab, 
Assessment report  
EMA/623887/2021 
Page 27/159 
 
 
 
 
total SN-38 and SN-38 was dose-proportional. After the last dose, exposure (based on AUC) was approx. 
1.5x of the exposure after the first dose for total Ab and up to 1.2x for total SN-38 and free SN-38. Thus, 
accumulation was minimal. On average, the exposure to free SN-38 was approximately 2.3 % of total SN-38 
based on AUC. SN-38G was detected in serum with a Tmax ranging from 4 to 12 hrs after the 1st dose and 
from 2 to 11 hrs after the last dose. 
ADA were detected in all sacituzumab govitecan treated groups and appeared to affect primarily the exposure 
in the low dose group, as exposures to total Ab, total SN-38 and free SN-38 were lower on after last dose 
compared to the first dose. 
Distribution and PK in tumour bearing mice 
The distribution of radio-labelled hRS7 and sacituzumab govitecan was studied in mice bearing human 
squamous cell lung carcinoma xenograft in study 031210-156. The radio-label was attached to the antibody, 
not SN-38, therefore, the data reflect uptake of the mAb component of the ADC. Since sacituzumab 
govitecan does not bind to mouse Trop-2, the target-mediated distribution in this study is limited to the Trop-
2 expressing tumor. In blood the ADC appeared to clear faster than the equivalent amount of unconjugated 
hRS7 mAb, however, this did not appear to affect tumour targeting. In addition to tumour, both hRS7 and 
sacituzumab govitecan distributed to normal tissues, primarily to liver, spleen, kidney and lungs among the 
normal tissues analysed. A preferential distribution of sacituzumab govitecan to the tumour compared to liver 
was only observed at 72 and 168 hrs.  
Metabolism and excretion: 
Studies on the metabolism and excretion of sacituzumab govitecan in non-clinical species were not performed 
based on the rationale that the Ab moiety of sacituzumab govitecan can be expected to be catabolised to 
amino acids in line with ICHS6(R1) which states that “omission of metabolism and excretion studies for the 
Ab moiety is accepted”.  
With regard to metabolism and excretion of the toxin moiety, the applicant refers to literature on metabolism 
of  irinotecan  in  humans  (Mathijssen  et  al.,  2001;  Slatter  et  al.,  2000.  Given  the  knowledge  on  SN-38 
metabolism and excretion in humans, additional studies to evaluate SN-38 metabolism/excretion in cynomolgus 
monkey were not done. 
Metabolism of MES 
Study BBIA-0004-DV-CB/BBIA-0005-DV-CB evaluated the involvement of human cytochrome P450 enzymes 
(CYPs) 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4 in MES metabolism using human recombinant enzymes and 
human liver microsomes. During 120 min incubation of the test systems with 5 μM MES, no CYP-mediated 
metabolism was detected. There was no indication of metabolism of MES by the major human cytochrome 
P450 enzymes under the conditions of the study. 
Study BBIA-0002-DV-TB investigated inhibition potential of the novel excipient MES for CYPs 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 
2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4 in human liver microsomes. Inhibitory activity of MES was observed only at very 
high concentrations. IC50 values exceeded 8 mM, which is more than 30-fold of the expected MES clinical 
Cmax of 0.054 mg/mL (0.256 mM). Therefore, inhibition potential of MES towards CYPs appears not clinically 
relevant.  
Study BBIA-0003-DV-DA aimed at assessing induction potential of MES with respect to CYP3A4, CYP1A2 and 
CYP2B6. The experiments were performed using single-donor hepatocytes from three individual donors. No

induction of these CYP enzymes at mRNA and enzyme activity level was detected at MES concentrations of 3 
and 30 mM. 
Study 3277-002, non-GLP Routes and rates of MES excretion were evaluated in a radioactivity mass balance 
study in male SD rats. After IV administration, Cmax was observed at 5 min post-dose and serum 
concentrations declined rapidly. Radioactivity was primarily excreted via urine within 24 hrs post-dose; while 
hepatobiliary excretion was limited 
PK drug interactions 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions have not been performed; the applicant refers to literature on drug 
interactions for SN-38 released from irinotecan and concludes that inhibitors of UGT1A1 may prolong the 
half-life of unconjugated SN-38.  
PK in tumour-bearing mice 
Three studies were submitted (Table below) in nude mice bearing 2 different human tumour xenografts 
(Capan-1 and NCI-N87) to assess potential differences between the biodistribution of SN-38 and SN-38G in 
tissues of animals administered irinotecan (40 mg/kg, IV) or sacituzumab govitecan (1 mg/kg, IV) (studies 
012014-275 and 062714-291 and  study published by Sharkey, R. M., et al., 2015). 
Table 2 Examination of SN-38 concentrations in tissues of nude mice bearing human cancer 
xenografts. 
Within the liver of these mice bearing human xenograft tumours, the majority of SN-38 detected was in the 
intact form (total SN-38), whereas free SN-38 was not detected in the liver. Conversely, only free SN-38 was 
detected in the intestine indicating that intact conjugate was not transported from the liver to the intestine.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicity of sacituzumab govitecan was assessed in Swiss Webster (SW) mice and cynomolgus monkeys, 
taking into account ICH guidelines S6(R1) and S9. In mice, sacituzumab govitecan does not recognise the 
target antigen Trop-2, thus these studies provide information on target-independent toxicity. Target-
dependent toxicity was assessed in cynomolgus monkeys. The genotoxic potential of SN-38 was assessed in 
vitro. In addition, the cytotoxicity of the novel excipient 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid (MES) was 
assessed in vitro. 
Single dose toxicity 
Single-dose toxicity studies with sacituzumab govitecan were not performed. Evaluation of acute toxicity after 
two high doses is reported in the repeat-dose toxicity section 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Studies 100209-143 and 122109-151 (non-GLP): Acute toxicity of high doses of sacituzumab govitecan was 
evaluated in Swiss Webster mice. These studies evaluate target-independent toxicity of sacituzumab govitecan 
since hRS7 does not recognise murine Trop-2. Two IP doses at up to 750 mg/kg/dose were given 3 days apart. 
All animals survived to the end of study (up to day 18 or day 39). In both studies, transient reductions in body 
weight  (up  to  9%)  and  transient  increases  in  liver  enzymes  (AST  and  ALT)  were  observed  sacituzumab 
govitecan-treated  animals.  There  were  no  treatment-related  changes  in  haematology  and  histopathology. 
Exposure to exposure to sacituzumab govitecan and/or free SN-38 was not determined. 
Study SNBL.160.03 (GLP): Cynomolgus monkeys were treated with two doses of sacituzumab govitecan at 
60 or 120 mg/kg IV three days apart. Treatment with the high-dose was associated with mortality. One male 
animal was found dead 3 days after the second dose. Cause of death was considered to be related to 
sacituzumab govitecan-related bone marrow suppression and gastrointestinal complications. In animals that 
survived to their scheduled necropsy, two types of responses were evident in both males and females. 1) 
decreased cellularity of all haematopoietic organs with decreases in counts of all blood cell types; 2) 
inflammation, haemorrhage and degeneration of various structures and regions within the gastrointestinal 
tract. In addition, pathological changes to the reproductive organs were observed in females: increased 
numbers of atretic follicles and fewer matured follicles in the ovaries, and mild to moderate haemorrhage of 
the endometrium and atrophy of endometrial glands. By day 32 the sacituzumab govitecan-related responses 
showed a trend towards or a complete recovery. In the absence of a NOAEL, the HNSTD in this study was 60 
mg/kg/dose. 
Study SNBL.160.25 (GLP): In the second study, cynomolgus were treated with lower doses of sacituzumab 
govitecan (up to 50 mg/kg/dose), in a treatment regimen representative of the clinical regimen, i.e. 4 cycles 
of 21 days duration with treatment on days 1 and 8 of the cycle. In this study sacituzumab govitecan was 
better tolerated, as there was no mortality. Sacituzumab govitecan-related findings in this study concerned 
the skin, with abnormal discoloration, alopecia and degeneration of hair follicles and sebaceous glands, in 
animals treated at 25 and 50 mg/kg. Further histopathological findings that were considered potentially

related to treatment are decreased in lymphoid cellularity in the thymus in individual animals and 1 case of 
mild renal periarteritis.  
A comparison of the exposure in cynomolgus at the NOAEL/HNSTD (50 mg/kg) and in humans at the 
proposed clinical dose (10 mg/kg) was made. The exposure margin was 6.4x for total antibody, 4.6x for total 
SN-38 and 3.1x for free SN-38.  
Genotoxicity 
CTP1595_R1b (GLP): The mutagenic potential of SN-38 was evaluated in a bacterial reverse mutation assay. 
SN-38 (up to 158 µg/plate) was tested using S. typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537 and E. 
coli strain WP2 uvrA pKM101 in the presence and absence of Aroclor-induced rat liver S9 enzymes. Under the 
condition of the study, SN-38 was found to be negative in the bacterial reverse mutation assay. 
CYP1595_R1a (GLP) The mutagenic potential SN-38 was evaluated in the in vitro mammalian cell 
micronucleus test using the CHO-K1 cell line. SN-38 (0.02 to 2 µg/ml) were tested in the absence and 
presence of Aroclor-induced rat liver S9 enzymes. Under the condition of the study, SN-38 was found to be 
positive for micronuclei formation under the experimental conditions of the study.  
The linker, also referred to as CL2A, was evaluated in silico using two quantitative structure activity 
relationship ((Q)SAR) methodologies to predict for bacterial mutagenicity in accordance with International 
Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) M7(R1). The 
expert rules-based methodology was Derek Nexus version 2.3.1 Knowledge Base 2020.1.0 and the 
statistical-based methodology was Leadscope Model Applier version 3.0.2-4. The Derek Nexus prediction was 
negative with no misclassified or unclassified features. The Leadscope Model Applier prediction was within the 
domain of applicability and the result was a negative prediction and therefore not considered genotoxic. 
Carcinogenicity 
No assessment of carcinogenicity has been conducted in accordance with ICH S9 according to which 
carcinogenicity studies are not warranted to support marketing for therapeutics intended to treat patients 
with advanced cancer.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have not been performed. Since the GLP-compliant 
genotoxicity studies as well as the general toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys demonstrated that SN-38, 
once released from the ADC, targets rapidly dividing cells, embryo-fetal development and reproductive 
toxicity studies are not needed to support a marketing authorisation application submission for the proposed 
indication as per ICH S9. The target patient population with Trop-2 expressing cancers are typically adults, 
therefore toxicity studies in juvenile animals were not conducted.

Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance was assessed within the repeat-dose toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys. In study 
SNBL.160.03, changes at the injection sites consisting of mild to moderate perivascular haemorrhage, 
moderate haemorrhage in the dermis and subcutis, and minimal to mild perivascular mixed cell infiltration 
were observed at the terminal necropsy. The applicant considers these changes to be due to mechanical 
stimulation or stimulation by leaked test article. 
In study SNBL.160.25, injection site changes were observed during macroscopic or microscopic examination 
in both treated animals and the controls. The study pathologist attributed these changes to mechanical 
trauma associated with the dosing procedure and not to the test article 
Other toxicity studies 
Toxicity of MES 
MES (2 (N morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid) is a buffer used as an excipient in the formulation of the drug 
product for sacituzumab govitecan (IMMU-132) and considered a novel excipient. At the recommended dose 
of 10 mg/kg (1 mL/kg), patients receive a dose of 4.88 mg/kg MES with each injection. Based on its intended 
use in patients with advanced cancer, the non-clinical assessment of MES followed ICH S9 guidance with 
consideration of the Guidance for Industry entitled, “Nonclinical Studies for the Safety Evaluation of 
Pharmaceutical Excipients”. 
In vitro cytotoxicity of MES [RR-24-OCT-2019; RR-05-NOV-2019] 
Study RR-24-oct-2019 evaluated if MES mediates any type of cytotoxic effect on two different human cancer 
cell lines, HCC18606 (TNBC) and T24 (urinary bladder transitional cell carcinoma). The MES concentrations 
evaluated ranged from 3.08 x 10-6M to 1.2 M. In this study, MES did have a growth-inhibitory effect, with an 
IC50 of 430 mM and 340 mM respectively.  
The plasma Cmax for MES was estimated as 0.6 mM, if sacituzumab govitecan was administered to an 80 kg 
patient as a single bolus IV injection. MES concentration of 0.6 mM was not cytotoxic in vitro, at a 10-fold 
higher concentration (6 mM), a modest growth inhibition was observed.  
The applicant indicates that the growth inhibition noted for MES was observed after a 96-h continuous 
exposure in tissue culture and considers that this is not likely to happen clinically since MES would be cleared 
from the plasma resulting in diminishing concentrations over time. 
Study RR-05-NVO-2019 evaluated, if MES affects the cytotoxic dose-response induced by sacituzumab 
govitecan in vitro. Possible changes to the sacituzumab govitecan-induced cytotoxicity in the presence of MES 
(0.6 mM and 6 mM) were assessed using HCC1806 and T24 cells.  
MES alone at 0.6 mM resulted in minimal growth inhibition (≤ 3.5%), at 6.0 mM growth inhibition was 
≤12.4%. At both concentrations, MES did not significantly alter the cytotoxicity profile of sacituzumab 
govitecan in either of the cell lines used in this assay. No significant differences in the sacituzumab govitecan 
IC50 were observed in the presence of MES (0.6 and 6.0 mM).  
Study 3277-001, GLP The applicant has evaluated the toxicity of MES in a 1 month study in SD rats. Rats 
received MES IV at up to 1000 mg/kg Q1W for a total of 4 doses. Parameters of observed were adequate for 
a general toxicity study. No MES-related effects were observed; in principle the NOEL of 1000 mg/kg can be 
agreed.

Genotoxicity of MES 
The genotoxic potential of MES was evaluated in 2 in vitro assays (Ames bacterial reverse mutation and in 
vitro chromosomal aberration assay 01551002, GLP) and in vivo in a rat micronucleus assay 3277-003, GLP. 
MES was found to be non-genotoxic in a bacterial mutation assay (01551001, GLP) and a mammalian 
chromosome aberration test in vitro. Furthermore, MES was found to be negative for clastogenic activity in 
vivo in a rat bone marrow micronucleus test.  
In addition to the studies submitted, the applicant refers to studies published by the European Chemicals 
Agency (ECHA) assessing the genotoxicity of MES. MES was found to be non-genotoxic in a bacterial 
mutagenicity assay (OCED TG 471) and in a micronucleus test (OCED TG 487). In addition, MES was not 
mutagenic in an in vitro mammalian cell mutation test in CHO V79 cells (OECD TG 476). 
Carcinogenicity of MES 
A literature search was performed to identify any other potential risks of MES (CAS#s 4432-31-9 and 
145224-94-8) including carcinogenicity. Data bases searched included Toxplanet and Toxline, VITIC version 
2020.1, Google, and the EPA Comptox Dashboard. This most recent search identified two additional studies 
with MES relevant to safety assessment. In all studies, no safety concern was identified. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
With regard to reproductive and developmental toxicity of MES, the applicant refers to a study published by 
the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) [ECHA 2021a]. According to the ECHA report, MES (hydrate form) 
did not adversely affect the reproductive performance in parental males and females; also development of F1 
off-spring (until PND 13) was not impaired at doses of up to 1000 mg/kg body weight per day. This 
corresponds to 930 mg/kg body weight/day of MES anhydrous form. 
Phototoxicity of MES 
In study RR10Jul2020 a solution of 25 mM MES at pH 6.5 did not absorb light in the range of 290 to 700 nm. 
In line with ICH S10, MES is not sufficiently photoreactive to result in direct phototoxicity. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant notes, that the Ab part of the active ingredient is unlikely to result in a significant risk to the 
environment as proteins of biological origin are abundant in the biosphere and are, if present in a soluble 
form in the environment, rapidly inactivated and degraded in the wastewater treatment facility.  
For SN-38, the applicant notes that it will be hydrolysed by endogenous esterases from the linker CL2A and 
that CL2A will remain covalently bound to the Ab and concludes that it is unlikely that SN-38 bound to the 
linker (SN-38-CL2A) will enter the environment at any meaningful concentration and therefore considers an 
environmental risk assessment for SN-38-CL2A not to be appropriate.  
The applicant supplies literature on fate and effects for some of the CL2A linker building blocks and 
concludes, that the building blocks and consequentially the linker do not pose a risk to the environment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/623887/2021 
Page 33/159 
 
 
 
 
 
The applicant concludes that SN-38 is considered as the relevant part of the active ingredient to base the 
assessment on. 
Screening for persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity (PBT) 
Information on the partition coefficient for SN-38 (predicted and experimentally determined) was retrieved 
from relevant databases and the literature. A partition coefficient (log P) of 2.65 for SN-38 was reported by 
Fang et al, 2018. Wu et al, 2019 reported the same partition coefficient for SN-38 which was experimentally 
determined using the shake flask method. All predicted log P values and log D values (at pH 5.5 and 7.4) 
were similar to or lower than the experimentally determined values. 
In summary, the octanol-water partition coefficient for SN-38 is below the trigger value (log Kow/log P >4.5). 
Therefore, no further screening for persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity is warranted. 
Calculation of the predicted environmental concentration in surface water (PECsw) 
Refinement of the Fpen value 
Taking into consideration the treatment schedule of twice every three weeks, the number of treatment days 
per year is 34.67 days. Thus, the Fpen (0.01) was refined by a factor of 0.095 (34.67 days/365 days). The 
refined Fpen (0.00095) was used for the calculation of the PECsw. 
PECsw for SN-38 
As described above the PEC value is calculated for SN-38. At a maximum daily dose of sacituzumab govitecan 
of 10 mg/kg (or 600 mg for a 60 kg patient) the maximum daily dose of SN-38 is 12 mg. Using the refined 
Fpen this gives: 
The calculated PECsw for SN-38 is approximately 2-fold below the action limit of 0.01 μg/L. No further 
investigations on the environmental fate and effects detailed in Phase II Tier A of the European Medicines 
Agency (EMA) guidance document are required. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical studies were, in general, performed in accordance with legal requirements and available 
guidelines including ICH S6 and ICH S9. Scientific advice on non-clinical developmental aspects has been 
received and the CHMP advice concerning the extent of the toxicology studies have been followed.  
The applicant has presented adequate non-clinical data which characterise the pharmacodynamic properties 
of sacituzumab govitecan. These data were presented in research study reports and in form of publications 
from the group in scientific journals. The ADC inhibits growth of Trop-2-positive tumour cells, including TNBC 
cells, in vitro as well as in xenograft transplant models in mice. In general, sacituzumab govitecan was more 
efficacious in tumour growth inhibition than irinotecan at the same SN-38 dose. Results from secondary PD 
studies indicate that the contribution of Fc effector functions to the anti-tumour activity of sacituzumab 
govitecan may be limited.  
In line with ICH S6 (R1), the safety pharmacology studies in vivo were incorporated into the two repeat-dose 
GLP-compliant toxicity studies in monkeys using the IV route of administration, consistent with that used

clinically. Overall, there were no apparent safety signals from the core battery of studies in major organ 
systems of cynomolgus monkeys at the highest dose tested (120 mg/kg, IV).  
Pharmacokinetic studies of sacituzumab govitecan comprised the in vitro assessment of its stability in human 
and cynomolgus serum, a study in mice comparing PK of sacituzumab govitecan and hRS7, a study in 
rabbits, comparing the PK of hRS7 manufactured according different processes and two toxicokinetic studies 
in cynomolgus monkeys. In addition, studies in tumour-bearing mice evaluated biodistribution of radio-
labelled sacituzumab govitecan vs. hRS7 and kinetics of sacituzumab govitecan vs. irinotecan. Studies on 
metabolism and excretion were not performed for sacituzumab govitecan. , instead the applicant refers to 
literature on the metabolism of irinotecan in humans which is accepted. ). Irinotecan is reported to act as a 
prodrug to SN-38 which is formed via carboxylesterase cleavage and has a 100 to 1000-fold higher cytotoxic 
effect than the parent drug or any of the other identified metabolites. This is however not verified by original 
data in the references provided. As irinotecan is a known substance approved and used in the treatment of 
advanced cancer and as the plasma exposure and distribution of the active metabolite SN-38 is evaluated in 
the non-clinical pharmacokinetic studies, and the plasma exposure of SN-38 is monitored in the non-clinical 
toxicology studies, the lack of further metabolic studies is considered acceptable and in line with ICH S9. In 
humans, SN-38 is metabolised in liver by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1) to the 
inactive compound SN-38G while cytochrome P450 enzymes do not appear to be involved in 
biotransformation of SN-38. According to literature, cynomolgus UGT1A1 was shown to glucuronidate SN-38 
in vitro with similar kinetics as the human enzyme [Hanioka et al, 2010], supporting the use of cynomolgus 
for the safety assessment of sacituzumab govitecan. In humans, SN-38 is excreted intact, lactone-hydrolysed 
or as glucuronide metabolite SN-38G [Slatter et al., 2000]. Fecal excretions represent the major elimination 
pathway 
The submitted studies and published literature are considered sufficient to characterise the ADME of 
sacituzumab govitecan and its metabolite. 
Omission of non-clinical PD drug interaction studies is accepted, based on the understanding of SN-38 
metabolism derived from literature on irinotecan metabolism in humans.  
The toxicity of sacituzumab govitecan was assessed in mice (acute toxicity) and in cynomolgus monkeys 
(long-term toxicity). Overall the programme is in line with ICH guidelines S6(R1) and S9. In mice, 
sacituzumab govitecan does not recognise the target antigen Trop-2, thus these studies provide information 
on target-independent toxicity. Target-dependent toxicity was assessed in cynomolgus monkeys. General 
toxicity studies with the toxin moiety SN-38 were not conducted. This is acceptable, in line with ICH S9 and 
taking into account published literature on the toxicity of irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38. The 
repeat-dose studies in cynomolgus identified gastrointestinal tract, lymphoid organs, bone marrow, bone 
marrow (and concomitant reductions in blood cells), skin and kidney as target organs of toxicity. Findings in 
the gastrointestinal tract and reductions in white blood cells are known toxicities of irinotecan-derived SN-38. 
Findings in skin may represent Trop-2-dependent toxicity. A comparison of the exposure in cynomolgus at 
the NOAEL/HNSTD (50 mg/kg) and in humans at the proposed clinical dose (10 mg/kg) was made. The 
exposure margin was 6.4x for total antibody, 4.6x for total SN-38 and 3.1x for free SN-38.  
Genotoxic potential of SN-38 was assessed in vitro. In a bacterial mutation assay SN-38 was not genotoxic, 
but was identified as clastogenic in a micronucleus test in mammalian cells, which is consistent with the 
genotoxicity of irinotecan. The linker structure CL2A was not considered genotoxic based on in silico 
structural analysis.

Based on the evidence for teratogenicity of irinotecan, sacituzumab govitecan has the potential for 
teratogenicity and/or embryofetal toxicity. This is reflected in the SmPC.  
Additional non-clinical studies were performed to characterise MES as a novel excipient.  
Metabolism studies in vitro showed that MES is not metabolised by human cytochrome P450 enzymes; in a 
radioactivity mass balance study in rats MES was rapidly eliminated via urinary excretion. According to 
literature on irinotecan metabolism [Mathijssen et al, 2001], SN-38 is generated from irinotecan by carboxy 
esterases. SN-38 is subsequently converted to a glucuronide derivative (SN-38G) by uridine diphosphate 
glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A) while cytochrome P450 enzymes do not appear to be involved in 
biotransformation of SN-38. In the responses to questions the applicant clarified that there is no evidence 
that CYP3A4 contributes to SN-38 metabolism. Consequently, only the effect of UGT1A1 inhibitors or inducers 
is addressed in the SmPC 
The safety of MES was evaluated in a GLP-compliant repeat-dose toxicity study in rats. In this study, the 
NOEL was 1000 mg/kg, the maximum feasible dose. However, the final study report, including bioanalysis 
and TK evaluation is still lacking.  
Exposure to MES is not demonstrated yet. The applicant confirmed that the final study report including 
bioanalysis and TK will be provided for review once available at the end of Q1 2022. 
Additional studies evaluated the genotoxic and phototoxic potential of MES. For reproductive and 
developmental toxicity the applicant refers to a study published by the European Chemicals Agency. These 
studies did not identify any safety concerns and are considered adequate to support the use of MES as 
excipient in the formulation of sacituzumab govitecan.

Table 4 Studies involving the Examination of the pharmacokinetic properties of SG 
The clinical pharmacology package for SG comprises noncompartmental PK analyses for Studies IMMU-132-
01 and IMMU-132-05, population PK analyses to examine the effects of intrinsic factors on PK variability, and 
analyses of exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety relationships. The recommended dose and regimen for SG 
is 10 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion once weekly on Days 1 and 8 of 21-day treatment cycles until disease 
progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
Bioanalytical assays 
PK assays 
Four analytes were measured to characterize the PK of SG:  
1) 
2) 
3) 
4) 
total antibody (hRS7 + hRS7-SN-38) 
free SN-38 (the cytotoxic payload, not covalently bound to SG) 
SN-38G (an inactive metabolite of SN-38, not covalently bound to SG) 
total SN-38 (free SN-38 + hRS7-SN-38)  
An LC-MS/MS method was developed for the quantification of free SN-38, SN-38G and total SN-38. Validation 
exercise comprised the analysis of selectivity, carry-over, sensitivity, linearity, accuracy, precision, stability 
and recovery. A further bioanalytical method based on an electrochemiluminescence assay (ECL) was 
developed for the determination of total antibody (hRS7-IgG + hRS7-SN38) in human serum. Validation 
parameters included accuracy, precision, selectivity, specificity, dilutional linearity, and matrix interference.  
Assessment report  
EMA/623887/2021 
Page 38/159 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No validated assay is currently available which is capable of distinguishing naked (unconjugated; DAR 0) 
hRS7-IgG from SN-38-conjugated SG (DAR 1-8). Therefore, the amount of SG in serum was calculated using 
the concentrations of measured total SN-38, free SN-38, and free SN-38G (see Equation 1 below). 
This calculated value may both under-estimate and over-estimate the actual amount of the ADC at various 
times post dose, since a fixed DAR of 8 is assumed in the equation, although it is known that the DAR of the 
ADC in circulation changes over time. 
Immunogenicity assays 
For the detection of anti-drug antibodies against SG a standard 3-tier approach comprising a screening (tier 
I) and a subsequent confirmatory assay (tier II), followed by the analysis of ADA titer (tier III) was applied. 
Validation results demonstrated that the assay performs with adequate precision and high sensitivity (≤3.9 
ng/mL). The drug tolerance level of the assay was 5 µg/ml hRS7-SN38 at 50 ng/mL ADA and 25 µg/mL 
hRS7-SN38 at 500 ng/mL ADA. A new ADA assay with several improvements to the immunogenicity assay 
and drug tolerance was developed and summarised below (method validation report for the revised ADA 
assay V1101906E1).

Noncompartmental PK analysis 
PK parameters were determined using noncompartmental analyses (NCA) in validated Phoenix® WinNonlin 
(Pharsight, Cary, NC) version 8.2 or higher and third-party reporting tools, including R version 3.6.3 or 
higher, and Microsoft® Office Word and Excel 2016. The results (not shown here) were characterised by 
standard PK parameters, including area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC), maximum 
observed serum concentration (Cmax), trough concentration (Ctrough), and terminal elimination half-life 
(t1/2), if feasible, and summarised using descriptive statistics ((number of subjects [n], mean, geometric 
mean, geometric coefficient of variation, coefficient of variation, median, minimum, and maximum). Area

under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) values were estimated using the linear trapezoidal rule. A 
minimum of 3 descending concentration-time points, excluding the Cmax, above the lower limit of 
quantification (LLOQ) were used in the estimation of the terminal elimination rate constant (λz) for the 
determination of t1/2. λz was reported wherever the adjusted coefficient of determination (R2) value is >0.8. 
The AUC0-inf, total volume of distribution during the terminal phase (Vz), and total body clearance (CL) values 
were reported in tables and figures only when extrapolation % for estimation of AUC0-inf ≤20%. 
Population PK analysis 
Population pharmacokinetic (PK) modelling for the 5 analytes of sacituzumab govitecan (serum-free SN-38, 
serum total SN-38, serum SN-38G, total antibody, and serum sacituzumab govitecan) was developed to 
evaluate the effects of covariates on the variability of the PK of the 5 analytes; and to characterize the 
exposure-response (E-R) relationships of the 5 analytes in terms of efficacy and safety.  
Pop PK data set used for the derivation of final pop PK models of different entities was pooled over three 
different indications and studies. Analysis of exposure and the effects of covariates were evaluated for only 
the relevant study, Study 05 and combined Study 05 and 01, while models were informed by PK data 
collected from three studies. 
The final selected model for SG was a 2-compartment model with first-order elimination. Weight effects were 
included on CL, V1, V2, and inter-compartmental clearance (Q) using fixed allometric exponents of 0.75 for 
the CL related terms and 1 for the volume of distribution (V) related terms. Baseline albumin was added to 
the V1 as a covariate. Between-subject variability was included on central CL and, V1, and a combined error 
model was used to characterize variability.

Table 6 
The final selected model for free SN-38 was a 2-compartment model with first-order elimination. Between-
subject variability was included central CL and V as well as on V2. Baseline weight effects were included on 
CL, V1, V2, and Q using fixed allometric exponents of 0.75 for the CL related terms and 1 for the distribution 
related terms. Between-subject variability was included on CL, V1, and V2, and a combined error model was 
used to characterize variability. No covariate effect was retained in the model. 
Table 7 
Overall, derived final pop PK models were able to predict the observed median and p5 and p95 of observed 
concentrations acceptably well. The median concentration was fully captured throughout the profiles over 
time since last dose. However, the overall range of variability in exposure is over-predicted as shown by p5 
and p95 percentiles observed vs predicted. Observed p95 and especially p5 were not well captured by 
predicted bands for segments of the time course. 
The final PK models were evaluated by goodness-of-fit (GOF) plots and VPCs.

Exposure-response-analyses 
Exposure-response analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between PK and efficacy and safety 
in the Phase 3 Study IMMU-132-05. Exposure-safety analyses were also conducted for a pooled dataset that 
included data from the mTNBC cohort in Study IMMU-132-01 (N=22) and Study IMMU-132-05 (N=250); this 
pool is referred to as the Overall Target TNBC pool. 
Each exposure-response analysis consisted of the following steps: 
1. 
Univariate exposure-response analyses: For each analyte, area under the concentration-time curve at 
steady state (AUCss), maximum concentration at steady state (Cmaxss) and average concentration at steady 
state (Cavgss) were tested as univariate predictors of response. Only the exposure measure with the lowest 
Assessment report  
EMA/623887/2021 
Page 45/159 
 
 
 
 
 
univariate Akaike information criterion (AIC) was carried forward for subsequent exposure-response 
analyses. 
2. 
Combined main effect exposure-response model: The univariate exposure measures selected for each 
analyte and all covariates were combined into a single linear model (Full Model) exposure-response model. A 
backward elimination procedure was then performed using the step AIC function until no terms remain in the 
model whose removal would result in an improvement (decrease) in AIC. 
3. 
Testing of bivariate interaction terms: Once backward elimination was completed, bivariate 
interaction terms of the selected exposure measure in step 1 and all the remaining covariates from step 2 
were evaluated. The initial model included all these possible bivariate terms. This model was again subjected 
to backward elimination using the step AIC function. The final model was comprised of main effect and 
interaction terms remaining after the second backward elimination procedure. 
Exposures that were shown to be significantly different from zero at the α=0.05 level (ie, p<0.05) with a 
confidence interval of odds ratio (OR)/hazards ratio (HR) that did not include 1 (null effect) were deemed 
significant. The number of patients with exposure data for free SN-38 and SG were 235 and 245, 
respectively. 
The pharmacokinetic parameters of sacituzumab govitecan and free SN-38 are presented in the Table below. 
Exposure parameters (Cmax and AUC0-168) were higher for SG than free SN-38.

Absorption  
SG is administered by IV infusion; there are no studies characterizing absorption by other routes of 
administration and thus, drug absorption is not applicable. 
Distribution 
Vss for SG derived by noncompartmental analysis in studies IMMU-132-01 and IMMU-132-05 was 2.82 L and 
2.45 L, respectively. Population PK results predicted V1, V2, and Q of SG to be 2.96 L, 1.22 L and 0.01 L/hr, 
respectively. For free SN-38, V1, V2, and Q were predicted to be 7383.00 L, 54780.00 L and 14.38 L/hr, 
respectively.

Elimination 
The mean terminal t½ of SG is approximately 15 hours. 
Table 9 
In study IMMU-132-01, CL of SG is listed with 149 L/h for the 10 mg/kg dose. In study IMMU-132-05, the 
estimated CL for sacituzumab govitecan was 0.138 L/hr in subjects with TNBC. In the population PK analysis, 
CL of sacituzumab govitecan was estimated to be 0.14 L/hr, while CL of free SN-38 was estimated to be 
292.70 L/hr. 
Studies of the excretion of the SG have not been conducted. SN-38 and SN-38 G are reported to be primarily 
excreted through the hepatobiliary route, with lesser amounts detected in the urine [Slatter et al, 2000; 
Matthijssen et al, 2001; Camptosar Prescribing Information]. 
No metabolism studies of SG have been conducted. The metabolism of SG is mediated by both catabolism of 
the antibody into individual amino acids and metabolism of SN-38 (the small molecule moiety of SG) by 
UGT1A1 in the liver to form the inactive metabolite, SN-38 glucuronide (SN-38G).  
PK of SN-38G 
Following IV administration of sacituzumab govitecan, the mean plasma concentrations of SN-38G did not 
increase significantly in a dose-dependent manner, there was no obvious non-linear or saturable clearance 
(data not shown).  
According to the population PK analysis, CL and V of SN-38G were 64.2 L/hr, and 160.8 L respectively. 
The model-predicted geometric mean (CV%) of AUC, Cmax, and Cavg across all subjects can be found in the 
Table below. 
Table 10 
Since SN-38 glucuronidation occurs via UGT1A1 in the liver, a possible effect of UGT1A1 on the concentration 
and safety/adverse effect endpoints (Diarrhoea, Neutropenia, Vomiting) of Free SN-38, Total SN-38 and SN-
38G was analysed in study IMMU-132-05.

Population PK analysis further indicated that UGT1A1 genotype is not a significant covariate for free SN-38 or 
SN-38G exposure. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality 
A nonlinear power model was used to assess the multiple-dose proportionality of sacituzumab govitecan, 
total SN-38, free SN-38, total antibody, and SN-38G if data permitted based on all subject exposures (Cmax 
and area under the serum concentration-time curve from time 0 to 24 hours [AUC0-24]) on Days 1 and 8 of 
Cycle 1 using Phoenix WinNonlin. If the 90% CI for the slope (B) includes 1.0, then the relationship was 
considered to be dose proportional. Geometric means of Cmax and AUC0-24 on Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 1 were 
tabulated by dose level. 
Parameters derived with the power model for sacituzumab govitecan are presented in Tables below, and the 
relationship between the exposure parameters of sacituzumab govitecan exposure and the dose of 
sacituzumab govitecan are shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Sacituzumab  govitecan  is  a  Trop-2-directed  antibody-drug  conjugate  with  the  small  molecule  SN-38,  a 
topoisomerase I inhibitor, covalently attached to the antibody by a hydrolysable linker. The mode of action as 
proposed for sacituzumab govitecan is as follows: Upon binding to Trop-2 sacituzumab govitecan is internalised 
with the subsequent release of SN-38 via hydrolysis of the linker. SN-38 interacts with topoisomerase I and 
prevents re-ligation of topoisomerase I-induced single strand breaks which if unrepaired, progress to double-
stranded DNA breaks. The resulting DNA damage leads to activation of several signalling pathways leading to 
apoptosis and cell death. Due to the hydrolysable linker, SN-38 can also be released extracellularly from the 
ADC by hydrolysis in the tumour environment. Since free SN-38 is membrane permeable it can diffuse into 
nearby cancer cells in the tumour microenvironment resulting in cell death of Trop-2 negative tumour cells. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Throughout the clinical studies, no specific pharmacodynamic endpoints were investigated. Pharmacodynamic 
effects of SN-38 have been described for the small molecule drug irinotecan and are therefore well known. 
Immunogenicity 
An ADA assay is currently under development and any samples from IMMU-132-01 analysed using this assay 
will be reported. In addition, an assay for the detection of neutralising anti-SG antibodies is in validation. 
Samples from Study IMMU-132-05 will be analysed once the new assays are available and fully validated. 
See also section 2.4.5.   
Cardiac electrophysiology 
Study IMMU-132-01 
QT prolongation was present in 15 of 420 patients (3.6%) during treatment. These patients were identified in 
one or more of three ways: they had an abnormal ECG that was determined by the site investigator to be 
clinically significant (search criterion: A); they were found to have prolonged QTcF values as determined by 
search of ECG numerical values in the ECG database (search criterion: B); a cardiac-related serious adverse 
event was recorded (search criterion: C). 
In all, QT prolongation was judged to be possibly related to SG in 4 of those 15 cases in which it was present 
(27% of cases, 0.95% of patients), probably unrelated in 8 cases and unrelated in the remaining 4. 
Using the threshold of >500 msec that was used by Porta-Sanchez to define clinically significant QTc 
prolongation, there were 8 cases (1.4% of all patients) in our study. 
In most patients in this study alternative explanations for QT prolongation and other cardiac adverse effects 
were present. QT prolongation was not judged to be definitely related to SG in any case and was thought to 
be possibly related in only 4 cases (0.95% of all enrolled subjects). None of the other cardiac adverse effects 
were judged to be related, probably related or possibly related to SG. 
Assessment report  
EMA/623887/2021

PR interval prolongation rates in oncology trials have not been reported on. The average PR increase over 
baseline in this trial was modest (4.65 msec). Though this could have been related to SG, there are many 
alternate explanations, as for QT prolongation, during cancer therapy. There were no adverse effects related 
to PR prolongation, and there were no reported second- or third-degree block events. 
This analysis is limited by the unavailability of numerical ECG data in many patients. The reliability of the 
available data is limited by the non-centralised nature of ECG acquisition and interpretation, and the fact that 
baseline ECGs were collected up to a month before initiation of treatment, without synchronisation of the 
time of day of ECG acquisition. Thus, firm conclusions are not possible, but it is reasonable to conclude that 
the nature and frequency of QT prolongation observed in this study are typical of oncology trials in general 
and that evidence is insufficient to conclude that SG is an independent cause of QT prolongation. 
Study IMMU-132-05 
Concentration-QTc modelling was performed using data collected from the QT sub-study of IMMU-132-05 
clinical study, to evaluate the relationship between serum free SN-38, serum total SN-38, serum serum total 
antibody, and serum sacituzumab govitecan concentration and QTc interval at clinical doses in oncology 
patients. 
The serum free SN-38, serum total SN-38, serum SN-38-glucuronide (SN-38G), serum total antibody, and 
serum sacituzumab govitecan were evaluated in the concentration-QTc analysis and deemed to have clinically 
significant QTc prolongation if the upper bound of the two—sided 90% condence interval [CI] of the predicted 
mean baseline-adjusted QTc at clinically relevant concentrations is 10 ms. 
Model Prediction for Free SN-38 
The final C-QTc model was used to predict the mean and 90% Cls of mean ΔQTcF for the range of 
concentrations in the data. The mean reaches the 10 ms boundary at 122 ng/mL. The slope parameter of the 
model had a p-value of 0.09 indicating lack of statistically significant correlation between ΔQTcF and free SN-
38 concentrations. Overall, the data available does not suggest a significant impact of concentration on 
ΔQTcF. 
Concentration-QTc modelling for total SN-38, SN-38G, total antibody and sacituzumab govitecan revealed a 
statistically significant correlation of serum concentrations and QTc prolongation. Based on the estimated 
slope parameters and sacituzumab govitecan exposures at the 10 mg/kg dose level, QT prolongation 
exceeding the 10 ms threshold at higher concentrations cannot be excluded, however, QT prolongation 
exceeding 20 ms seems unlikely based on the totality of the data. 
Exposure-response analyses 
Exposure-efficacy-analyses 
There was no significant relationship for either AUC or Cmax and PFS or OS) for SG and free SN-38 (data not 
shown). 
Exposure-safety-analyses 
Univariate exposure-safety analyses identified significant relationship of SG exposure (especially Cmax) and 
probability of vomiting or diarrhoea (not for free SN-38). Odds ratio > 1 indicates that baseline weight is 
associated with higher odds of occurrence of diarrhoea or vomiting. Further, Odds ratio > 1 indicates that 
baseline weight is also associated with the higher odds of occurrence of dose reduction and dose delay.  
Assessment report

In addition, there was a trend in higher probability of neutropenia with increase in SG AUC and SG Cmax 
observed in Study IMMU-132-05. Odds ratio >1 indicates that UGT1A128/28 is associated with a higher odds 
of occurrence of Neutropenia.

There was no significant relationship for either AUC, Cmax, or Cavg with nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, 
neutropenia, or hypersensitivity for both SG and free SN-38 (final full combined effect model). 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The clinical pharmacology package of sacituzumab govitecan so far comprised two clinical studies (study 
IMMU-132-01 and study IMMU-132-05) contributing to the characterisation of PK of the 5 analytes SG, free 
SN-38, total SN-38, SN-38G, and total antibody. In study IMMU-132-01, doses of 4.5 to 18 mg/kg IV were 
investigated. 
The proposed standard dose of SG is 10 mg/kg administered IV once weekly on Days 1 and 8 of 21-day 
treatment cycles. 
SG contains a hydrolysable linker (CL2A), which links the humanised monoclonal antibody to SN-38. The 
applicant describes that the linker is still attached to the IgG molecule after release of SN-38 and that free 
linker is not present in the circulation.  
Analytical methods 
Free SN-38, SN-38G and total SN-38 (after application of a hydrolysis step) were quantified after solid phase 
extraction by a validated LC-MS/MS method. During validation, all investigated parameters met the

acceptance criteria of the relevant EMA guidance (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1 Corr. 2**). Long-
term frozen stability of free SN-38/SN-38G, total SN-38, and total antibody at -80°C has been shown for 
832, 792, and 994 days. This period sufficiently covers the maximum storage time between sample collection 
and analysis of samples from clinical study IMMU-132-05 for each of the analytes. Only for study IMMU-132-
01, the analysis is pending and will continue into 2023 in order to cover the study sample storage duration. 
The applicant committed to provide long-term stability data for study sample storage duration in Study 
IMMU-132-01 as a post-authorisation measure by Q4 2023. 
For quantification of total antibody (hRS7-IgG and hRS7-SN38), an electrochemiluminescence assay (ECL) 
was developed and adequately validated.  
No assay capable of distinguishing naked (unconjugated; DAR 0) hRS7-IgG from SN-38-conjugated SG (DAR 
1-8) was available. The amount of SG in serum was therefore calculated by applying a fixed DAR of 8 and 
using the concentrations of measured total SN-38, free SN-38, and free SN-38G. It has to be recognised that 
this calculated value may both under-estimate and over-estimate the actual amount of the ADC since the 
DAR of the ADC in circulation changes over time. 
However, no bioanalytical study reports on ADA have been provided. The applicant committed to provide the 
bioanalytical study reports for antidrug-antibody (ADA) and neutralizing antibody (NAb) determination for 
both Studies IMMU-132-01 and IMMU-132-05 as well as the NAb assay method validation report as a post-
authorisation measure by Q3 2022. 
PK parameters were determined using noncompartmental analyses (NCA) in validated reporting tools. 
Population pharmacokinetic (pop PK) modelling for the 5 analytes of sacituzumab govitecan (serum-free SN-
38, serum total SN-38, serum SN-38G, total antibody, and serum sacituzumab govitecan) was conducted to 
evaluate the effects of covariates on the variability of the PK of the 5 analytes; and to characterize the 
exposure-response (E-R) relationships of the 5 analytes in terms of efficacy and safety.  
During evaluation of final pop PK analyses for different entities, cancer type was found a statistically 
significant covariate on PK. Data did not indicate a significant effect of gender on the exposure of both SG 
and free SN-38. Forest plot analyses involved UGT1A1 polymorphism, that also did not indicate to have a 
significant effect on exposure (AUC, Cmax) of SG and free SN-38. Pairwise distribution of continuous and 
categorical covariates were provided and corrected, indicating strong correlations between covariates tumor 
type, sex, UGT1A1, race and GFRCAT.  
Overall, derived final pop PK models were able to predict the observed median and p5 and p95 of observed 
concentrations acceptably well. The median concentration was fully captured throughout the profiles over 
time since last dose. However, the overall range of variability in exposure is over-predicted as shown by p5 
and p95 percentiles observed vs predicted. Observed p95 and especially p5 were not well captured by 
predicted bands for segments of the time course. 
ADME 
SG is administered as IV infusion and is therefore 100% bioavailable. Tmax of SG and free SN-38 ranged 
between 3 – 4 hours. Cmax of SG and free SN-38 in study -01 was 227,000 ng/ml and 120 ng/ml, 
respectively. In study -05, Cmax of SG and free SN-38 was 240,000 ng/ml and 90.6 ng/ml. 
Volume of distribution of SG (2.5 – 3 L) is similar to typical values described for monoclonal antibodies, 
indicating that distribution is mainly restricted to the systemic circulation. An error in calculation of Vss for SG 
by NCA in study IMMU-132-05 was corrected in the eCTD submission 0001 and finally in section 5.2 of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/623887/2021 
Page 57/159 
 
 
 
SmPC for Trodelvy. Values for volume of distribution of free SN-38 should be considered as apparent values, 
since kinetics of SN-38 is limited by its release from the antibody. 
Clearance of SG was estimated to be 0.14 L/h in the population PK analysis. Similar results were obtained by 
noncompartmental analysis. The typical plasma clearance of unconjugated mAbs has been described to range 
between 0.2 – 0.4 L/day for a 70 kg adult. Thus, CL of SG is significantly higher as compared to a typical 
mAb, which is further reflected by a shorter half-life of only approx. 15 hours as compared to the half-life of 
14 – 21 days, which is typically observed for unconjugated mAbs. Half-life of total antibody was approx. 3-4 
fold higher as compared to SG, free SN-38, total SN-38 or SN-38G.  
As to the linker molecule, it is expected that it will be degraded through enzymatic degradation while 
attached to the antibody. 
Dose proportionality and time dependency 
Dose proportionality of PK of SG and free SN-38 at steady state was confirmed. 
Referring to the rather short half-life of 15 – 20 hours determined for SG and free SN-38, no accumulation is 
expected for the proposed dosing regimen (once weekly on Days 1 and 8 of 21-day treatment cycles). This is 
supported by population PK analysis revealing no difference of SG AUC or Cmax comparing Day 1 and Day 8. 
Similar results were obtained for free SN-38, SN-38G, and total SN-38. Significant accumulation between Day 
1 and Day 8 was however observed for AUC and Cmax of total antibody, which is in line with the described 
longer t1/2 (approx. 50 – 60 h) of total antibody. Referring to pop PK analyses, the exposure of total 
antibody was observed to reach steady state by Cycle 8. Time-dependent clearance is not expected based on 
the assessment of the pop PK conditional weighted residuals where there were no apparent trends or biases 
over time. 
PK in the target population 
Values derived by NCA analysis were overall comparable between study -01 and study -05. In general, SG 
concentrations must be considered imprecise, given that there is no validated assay for quantification of SG 
in plasma. SG concentrations were calculated assuming a fixed DAR of 8, however, the DAR of the ADC in 
circulation changes over time and SG concentrations may be over- or under-estimated.  
In the population PK analysis, Results are similar to NCA analyses. Impact of concomitant medication on SN-
38 PK was not evaluated in the current population PK analyses. A trend towards increased incidence of 
neutropenia and diarrhoea was seen in patients with UGT1A1*28/28 genotype. However, Cmax of free SN-38 
was even lower in patients with UGT1A1 genotype 28/28 as compared to patients with wildtype or 
heterozygous UGT1A1.The applicant plans to evaluate the impact of concomitant medications including 
UGT1A1 inhibitors/inducers on SN-38 PK in future pop PK model refinement when data from new studies are 
available. The applicant commits to provide these data post-approval. 
Steady state PK parameters were provided that confirm no accumulation of SG and free SN-38 after repeated 
dosing (3-week cycles with dosing on Day 1 and Day 8). Accumulation was however seen for total antibody, 
which is anticipated due to the longer half-life observed for total antibody (study -01: 67.2 h, study-05: 54.5 
h, popPK estimate: 134 h). The population PK derived estimates for elimination half-life of SG are higher 
(median [min, max]: 79.4 h [35.5, 128]) than the NCA-derived values (mean of approx. 15 h). Similarly, the 
estimate for elimination half-life of total antibody is higher in the population PK analysis. In the SmPC, half-
life of SG is described with 15.3 hours as derived by NCA in study -05. The applicant clarified that the 
estimated half-life based on NCA was primarily driven by the distribution phase half-life, since limited PK 
sampling was conducted in the true terminal elimination phase. It was argued that the distribution phase 
Assessment report  
EMA/623887/2021 
Page 58/159 
 
 
 
covers most of the AUC based on the measurable concentrations and therefore the half-life determined by 
NCA approximates better the effective half-life and is considered to be a more reliable estimate for the half-
life of SG and the total antibody. This is also supported by limited accumulation observed for SG and total 
antibody over time. An analysis of distribution half-life (alpha phase; α half-life) and elimination half-life 
(beta phase; β half-life) conducted by population PK resulted in values of 13.5 h and 91.7 h for alpha and 
beta half-life, respectively. Conclusively, the popPK-derived value for alpha half-life is similar to the NCA-
derived estimate.  
PK in special populations 
The effect of the intrinsic factors weight, age, UGT1A1, GFR, hepatic impairment, albumin concentration, 
alkaline phosphatase and race on SG and free SN-38 exposure was examined using the population PK model. 
No impact of mild renal or hepatic impairment on the exposure of SG or free SN-38 was observed. No data 
are available for patients with moderate to severe renal or hepatic impairment. Gender effects were analysed 
in study IMMU-132-01, where female patients presented with reduced dose-normalised AUC of SG and 
increased SG CL as compared to male patients. As per population PK analysis, higher body weight was 
associated with a (non-significant) increase of SG exposure, which is assumed to be driven by weight-
adjusted SG dosing. For the subject exhibiting the lowest exposure, it seems to be due to a combination of 
low weight-based dose and high clearance. Race did not significantly influence the exposure of SG or free SN-
38. No significant differences in exposure of SG or free SN-38 were seen in the elderly. No data in children 
are available. 
Interactions 
No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with either SG or its components which is acceptable. 
Systemic exposure to SN-38 may be increased due to concomitant administration of SG with inhibitors of 
UGT1A1, which may further increase the incidence of adverse reactions. In contrast, in patients 
concomitantly receiving UGT1A enzyme inducers, exposure of SN-38 may be reduced, which may impact 
efficacy of SG. Therefore, UGT1A1 inhibitors or inducers should not be administered with SG. This is 
adequately reflected in section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
Exposure relevant for safety evaluation 
In comparison to irinotecan at a dose level of 350 mg/m², the total amount of SN-38 administered with SG is 
reduced by approximately factor 30. However, it is noted that exposure of free SN-38 after administration of 
SG is higher than the exposure of SN-38 after administration of irinotecan at the dose level of 350 mg/m²:  
Cmax of SN-38 is described to be 90.6 ng/ml for SG as compared to 56 ng/mL for irinotecan, AUC(0-24h) is 
described to be 1440 ngxh/mL for SG as compared to 474 ngxh/mL for irinotecan. Considering that SG is a 
targeted therapy which is intended to deliver the toxic moiety directly to the tumour/site of action, it appears 
unexpected that such high plasma concentrations of SN-38 are necessary. However, despite an 
approximately 2- to 3-fold higher AUC of SN-38 observed with SG in comparison to irinotecan, the safety 
profiles (e.g. incidences of neutropenia) of irinotecan and SG were suggested to be similar.  
Pharmacodynamics 
Throughout the clinical studies, no specific pharmacodynamic endpoints were investigated. Pharmacodynamic 
effects of SN-38 have been described for the small molecule drug irinotecan and are therefore well known. 
Immunogenicity 
Assessment report  
EMA/623887/2021 
Page 59/159 
 
 
 
 
Only a subset of available samples collected in study IMMU-132-01 were analysed. Referring to the results 
presented in bioanalytical study report BIMME1715E1/BIMME1717E1, and the majority of these were 
reported as ADA negative. Complete ADA and NAb results from study -01 and -05, including the analysis of 
the impact of ADA status on PK, efficacy and safety within an integrated summary of immunogenicity, will be 
provided as post authorisation measure (REC) by Q3/2022 at the latest.  
Cardiac electrophysiology / QT prolongation 
In study IMMU-132-01, clinically significant QTc prolongation was only seen in 1.4% of all patients and 
thought to be possibly related in only 4 cases (0.95% of all enrolled subjects). ECG analyses and 
interpretation had several limitations, e.g. numerical ECG data was unavailable in many patients, ECG 
acquisition and interpretation was performed non-centralised, and baseline ECGs were collected up to one 
month before treatment without any synchronisation. Altogether, QT prolongation was not judged to be 
definitely related to IMMU-132 in any case, which is agreed. 
Concentration-QTc modelling for total SN-38, SN-38G, total antibody and sacituzumab govitecan revealed a 
statistically significant correlation of serum concentrations and QTc prolongation. Based on the estimated 
slope parameters and sacituzumab govitecan exposures at the 10 mg/kg dose level, QT prolongation 
exceeding the 10 ms threshold at higher concentrations cannot be excluded, however, QT prolongation 
exceeding 20 ms seems unlikely based on the totality of the data. Importantly, statistical significance was not 
reached in concentration-QTc modelling for free SN-38. Overall, it may therefore be agreed that no evidence 
for significant or clinically relevant QTc prolongation was seen for SG and other analytes in the PK-QTc 
substudy of Study IMMU-132-05. 
In addition, irinotecan itself has not been reported as a typical drug with a risk of QTc prolongation in the 
past. 
Exposure-response analyses 
No exposure-efficacy relationship was identified for SG or free SN-38 with regard to ORR, PFS, and OS, 
neither in the analysis of subjects with mTNBC in study IMMU-132-05 only nor in the analysis of subjects with 
mTNBC in both study IMMU-132-01 and study IMMU-132-05. In part, the highest exposure quartile(s) even 
showed a tendency towards lower efficacy. 
Univariate exposure-safety analyses identified significant relationship of SG exposure (especially Cmax) and 
probability of vomiting or diarrhoea (not for free SN-38). An odds ratio > 1 indicates that baseline weight is 
associated with higher odds of occurrence of diarrhoea or vomiting. Further, an odds ratio > 1 indicates that 
baseline weight is also associated with the higher odds of occurrence of dose reduction and dose delay.  
In addition, there was a trend in higher probability of neutropenia with increase in SG AUC and SG Cmax 
observed in Study IMMU-132-05. Odds ratio >1 indicates that UGT1A128/28 is associated with a higher odds 
of occurrence of neutropenia. 
However, the final full combined main effect model did not reveal that AUC, Cmax or Cav of SG or free SN-38 
were significant covariates predicting toxicity (except for dose delay, which correlated with AUC and weight of 
all analytes except for SN-38G).

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics of SG and its relevant analytes have been analysed in both clinical studies (IMMU-132-01 
and IMMU-132-05) pertinent to the claimed indication TNBC. In general, PK of SG and the relevant analytes 
was as expected for an ADC. Data on steady state exposure revealed no accumulation of SG and free SN-38. 
Overall, derived final pop PK models were able to predict the observed median and p5 and p95 of observed 
concentrations acceptably well but indicate high variability.  
Impact of concomitant medication on SN-38 PK was not evaluated in the current population PK analyses. No 
results on immunogenicity of SG have been presented. Long-term stability data for study sample storage 
duration are also missing in Study IMMU-132-01. 
Therefore the CHMP recommended to the following measures necessary to address the issues related to 
pharmacology:  
• 
• 
• 
provide bioanalytical study reports for antidrug-antibody (ADA) and neutralizing antibody (NAb) 
determination for both Studies IMMU-132-01 and IMMU-132-05, the NAb assay method validation 
report as well as an integrated summary of immunogenicity by Q3 2022. 
Provide data on the impact of concomitant medications including UGT1A1 inhibitors/inducers on SN-
38 PK based on the future PopPK model refinement by Q3 2022 
Provide long-term stability data for study sample storage duration in Study IMMU-132-01 by Q4 2023 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The primary support for the efficacy of SG as monotherapy “for the treatment of adult patients with 
unresectable or metastatic TNBC who have received two or more prior therapies, including at least one of 
them for advanced disease”, is provided by the controlled Phase 3 study, IMMU-132-05. Supportive efficacy 
data are available from a cohort of 108 mTNBC patients with relapsed/refractory mTNBC who received a 
starting dose of 10 mg/kg SG in the uncontrolled, open-label study, IMMU-132-01.  
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
Study IMMU-132-01  
Study IMMU-132-01 is an uncontrolled, Phase 1/2 basket study in which SG monotherapy was evaluated in 
previously-treated metastatic epithelial cancers. Please see also section “supportive study”. 
Phase 1 was a dose escalation, 3+3 design in which SG doses of 8, 10, 12, and 18 mg/kg were administered. 
The primary objectives of Phase 1 were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SG as a single agent 
administered in 3-week treatment cycles, to determine a maximum acceptable dose and select cancer types 
for a continued expanded study in Phase 2. 
Dose selection: 
SG 12 mg/kg was determined as the MTD in Phase 1; however, this dose was associated with dose 
reductions and dose delays in many subjects. Therefore, a maximum acceptable dose, defined as the highest 
dose at which ≥2 of 6 treated subjects tolerated a 3-week treatment cycle without the need for either a dose 
Assessment report  
EMA/623887/2021 
Page 61/159 
 
 
 
 
delay or dose reduction and without experiencing any AE ≥grade 3, was defined. Both 8 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg 
met the criteria for a maximum acceptable dose. 
Subjects in Phase 2 were enrolled in a sequential manner to the 8 mg/kg dose and subsequently to the 10 
mg/kg dose. An interim analysis was performed when 81 and 97 patients with different tumor types had 
been treated at the 2 dose levels, respectively. The duration of treatment at the 2 dose levels was similar and 
no important differences in safety were seen. However, the 10 mg/kg dose compared with the 8 mg/kg dose 
was associated with a higher ORR (22% and 10%, respectively) and clinical benefit rate (CBR) [Ocean et al, 
Cancer 2017]. Based on these data, 10 mg/kg SG was selected as the dose for this study.

Treatments 
Prophylactic antiemetic drugs for both treatment arms 
Prior to the administration of either SG or TPC, patients were administered a 2- or 3-drug combination 
regimen (eg, dexamethasone with either a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist or a NK1 receptor antagonist and other 
drugs as indicated) for prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. 
All patients were given additional medications for prevention and treatment of nausea, vomiting, and 
diarrhoea for use at home. 
SG arm 
Premedication to prevent infusion reactions with sacituzumab govitecan (SG), including antipyretics, H1 and 
H2 blockers, or corticosteroids (50 mg hydrocortisone or equivalent orally or intravenously [IV]), was 
strongly recommended.  
SG 10 mg/kg was administered on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day treatment cycle as a slow IV infusion either by 
gravity or with an infusion pump.  
The initial infusion was administered slowly and incrementally advanced if vital signs were stable and in the 
absence of infusion reactions. If infusion reactions or vital sign changes occurred, the infusion rate was either 
slowed, interrupted, or terminated.

Dose Reduction, Treatment Interruption, or Termination 
Sacituzumab Govitecan 
Dose reductions, treatment interruptions, or permanent discontinuations of SG were allowed in the event of 
toxicity.  
The first dose of SG on Day 1 of Cycle 1 was not administered if a patient had ≥grade 2 neutropenia or 
≥grade 2 GI toxicity (either disease related or from prior therapy); treatment was withheld until resolution to 
grade 1 or lower. If recovery to ≤grade 1 required more than a 3-week delay, the patient was withdrawn 
from the study. 
Treatment was permanently discontinued if a patient had any ≥grade 3 infusion reactions that occurred after 
premedication with antihistamines, H2 blockers, and steroids. 
If ≥grade 3 toxicity was present on a scheduled treatment day, SG was not administered. If recovery to 
≤grade 1 delayed the next dose by only 1, 2, or 3 weeks, SG treatment was resumed (see Table below). If 
recovery to ≤grade 1 required more than a 3-week delay, treatment was permanently discontinued. 
The development of grade 4 neutropenia ≥7 days, grade 3 febrile neutropenia, and grade 3 or grade 4 non-
haematologic toxicity (Table below), despite medical treatment, required permanent dose reduction for that 
patient by 25% of the assigned dose for first occurrence, 50% of the initial assigned dose for the second 
occurrence, and, treatment discontinuation for the third occurrence. The SG dose was not re-escalated after 
reduction.

The primary objective of the study was to compare the efficacy of SG to the treatment of physician’s choice 
(TPC) as measured by independently-reviewed progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with locally-
advanced or metastatic TNBC previously treated with at least 2 systemic chemotherapy regimens for 
unresectable, locally-advanced or metastatic disease and without brain metastasis at baseline (brain 
metastasis negative [BM-ve] Population). 
Secondary objectives 
• 
PFS for the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population 
•  Overall survival (OS) in both the ITT population and in the subgroup without brain metastasis 
• 
Independently-determined objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), and time to onset 
of response (TTR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 
•  Quality of life (QOL) 
•  Safety, including adverse events (AEs), safety laboratories and evaluations, incidence of dose delays and 
dose reductions, and treatment discontinuations due to AEs 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: 
PFS by Independent Review Committee (IRC) assessment per RECIST v1.1 in patients without brain 
metastasis at baseline  
Secondary endpoints: 
Secondary endpoints were analysed in the BM-ve and ITT Populations by IRC assessment (assessment by 
investigator as supportive sensitivity analyses) 
• 
PFS, time from randomisation until objective tumor progression or death, whichever came first  
•  OS (overall survival), time from randomisation until death 
•  ORR (objective response rate), percentage of patients who had either a confirmed CR or PR 
• 
TTR (time to response), time from randomisation or the start of study treatment to the first recorded 
objective response (ie, CR or PR) 
•  DOR (duration of response), number of days between the first date showing a documented response of 
CR or PR and the date of progression or death 
•  CBR (clinical benefit rate), percentage of patients with either CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) with a 
duration of ≥6 months 
•  Quality of life, assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C-30

Sample size 
The study was planned to randomize 488 patients. The primary analysis was performed when 425 IRC-PFS 
events have occurred in the ITT population and 315 or more PFS events in the BM-ve population. Assuming 
at most 15 % patients have brain metastases and there are 13 % or fewer IRC events compared to 
investigator review, it would be expected that there are at least 315 IRC events in the BM-ve Population at 
the time 425 investigator PFS events have been observed amongst all randomised.  
The PFS power calculation based on the assumption of a median PFS of 3 months in the control TPC group, a 
24 months enrollment period, and that the primary analysis was performed after at least 4 months. If the 
true hazard ratio was 0.6667 in the IRC review of the BM-ve population, the study have had at least 95% 
power to detect a statistically significant improvement in PFS, with a two-sided type-1-error of 5%, if data 
were analysed after 315 IRC PFS. 
An interim analysis for OS analyses was planned at the same time as the PFS analysis after, and the final 
analysis after at least 330 deaths have occurred in the BM-ve population (approx. at 17 months follow up). 
Further assumptions on the OS power calculation was a median OS time of 10 months in the control arm, and 
72 % of the planned number of deaths in BM-ve population have occurred at the time of interim analysis. If 
the true hazard ratio was 0.7 in the BM-ve population, there is a 89.5% power to detect an improvement in 
OS in the BM-ve population, with a two-sided 5% type-I-error rate. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomised in a 1:1 allocation to receive either sacituzumab govitecan (IMMU-132) at a dose 
level of 10 mg/kg on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle or Treatment of Physician’ Choice (TPC). Randomisation 
was stratified by means of an interactive web-based response system (IWRS) according to the number of 
prior treatments (2-3, >3), presence of known brain metastases at study entry (yes/no), and North America 
vs Rest of the world.  
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open label study. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis population: 
The primary analysis population for efficacy was planned to be the subset of the ITT population without brain 
metastases at baseline, called BM-ve Population, defined as all randomised patients. Patients were assigned 
to the treatment group to which they were randomised.  
The ITT population was defined as all patients who have been randomised to the trial. Patients were assigned 
to the treatment group to which they were randomised. Data was analysed in the ITT population after the 
primary hypothesis on the BM-ve Population has been tested. 
Assessment report  
EMA/623887/2021 
Page 69/159 
 
 
 
 
 
The Safety population was defined as all patients administered at least one dose of IMMU-132 or TPC. Safety 
endpoints were planned to be analysed using the safety population. 
The PK population was defined as a subset of approximately 20 patients randomised to IMMU-132 who 
received intensive PK serum sampling schedules and deemed to have sufficient PK, safety and efficacy data 
to enable population PK. 
Primary endpoints: 
The primary endpoint was defined as Progression-Free Survival (PFS) determined by IRC. Further endpoints 
under the type-I-error control are OS in the BM-ve population, PFS in the ITT population, and OS in the ITT 
population. Further secondary endpoints are IR-ORR, duration of response and time to onset of response 
according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, as well as quality of life and safety. 
For the definition of PFS the following censoring rules were applied:

Primary analysis: 
A stratified log-rank test stratified by randomisation strata was used to compare the treatment groups for the 
time-to-event endpoints of PFS and Overall Survival Estimates of hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals 
of PFS and OS were based on a stratified Cox proportional hazard regression model with treatment arm as 
the only covariate. Results were illustrated by Kaplan-Meier curves, median PFS and its associated 95% Cis 
determined by the Brookmeyer and Crowley method with log-log transformation. 
Overall survival were planned to be analysed both at the time of the primary PFS analysis and, if not 
statistically significant at this time, later when a total of 330 deaths have occurred in the primary analysis 
population of randomised patients without brain metastases. 
Unless otherwise specified missing data were not imputed or “carried-forward”. 
Sensitivity analyses for PFS: 
Sensitivity analyses of PFS in the BM-ve Population and ITT Population will be generated following the FDA 
Guidance of Clinical Trial Endpoints for the Approval of Cancer Drugs and Biologics (December 2018) and 
Clinical Trial Endpoints for the Approval of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Drugs and Biologics (April 2015). The 
differences between the primary analysis PFS definition and comparisons of their censoring rules are 
illustrated in the table above. 
Multiplicity: 
The type I error across populations and the two key endpoints of IRC assessed PFS and overall survival (OS) 
was strictly controlled at a two-sided alpha of 0.05 by a hierarchical testing strategy in the following order:  
(1)  PFS BM-ve, (2) OS BM-ve, (3) PFS ITT, and (4) OS ITT. 
If fewer than 30 patients with brain metastases are recruited, analyses in the ITT population were planned to 
be removed from the hierarchy.  
Interim Analyses: 
Up to Version 8 of the statistical analysis plan one interim analysis of overall survival was planned at the time 
of the final PFS analysis with an appropriate alpha spending approach (Lan-DeMets spending function with 
O’Brien/Fleming stopping boundaries). The final analysis of PFS events was defined at 315 IRC-PFS events in 
the BM-ve population when 72% of the planned number of deaths was expected. The final OS analysis was 
planned when 330 deaths in the BM-ve population have occurred. If the final number of events differs from 
expected, the final significance level was planned to be adjusted so that the overall alpha is controlled given 
the significance level applied at the first analysis.  
With version 9 of the statistical analysis plan (April 06, 2020), which was implemented one months after the 
data base cutoff, the primary analysis was changed to only one analysis for OS and PFS at 302 of the 315 (or 
96%) targeted PFS events. This analysis should serve as the final analysis for PFS and OS for both the BM-ve 
and ITT populations. The two-sided significance level for PFS was set to be 0.0443 as well as for the 
subsequent testing steps.  
The number of deaths in the primary BM-ve population was close to reaching full maturity (316 of the 330, or 
96% of the deaths the protocol specified in the primary BM-ve population for the final OS analysis), thus this 
analysis was also served as the final analysis for the secondary endpoint of OS.

Recruitment 
Study IMMU-132-05 recruited patients from 82 sites in North America and Europe. The first patient was 
enrolled 03 November 2017 and the last participant was randomised 17 September 2019. As of the data cut-
off date of 11 March 2020, the median follow-up duration was 10.6 months for participants in the SG arm

compared with 6.3 months the TPC arm (ITT population). A higher percentage of patients in the SG group 
compared with the TPC group are alive and in survival follow-up (28.5% and 14.9%, respectively). 
Screen failures 
Of the 730 patients screened for the study, n=201 (27.5%) were not randomised. The most frequent reasons 
for screening failure (in ≥10 patients) were the lack of stable CNS disease for at least 4 weeks (12.9%), 
inadequate renal and hepatic function (12.4%), no confirmed TNBC per ASCO/CAP criteria (11.9%), no 
measurable disease (8.0%), inadequate haematology (6%), and ECOG PS of >1 (5%). Of note, 30% of all 
patients with brain metastases failed screening due to lack of stable CNS disease for at least 4 weeks;  
A total of 61 patients with brain metastases were included in the study: 32 in the SG group and 29 
in the TPC group (please see also baseline data). These patients were excluded from the primary analysis 
population for efficacy. The primary efficacy analysis was performed in the Brain metastasis negative (BM-ve) 
Population that consisted of 235 patients in the SG group and 233 patients in the TPC group who had no 
brain metastases at baseline.  
Imbalance in withdrawals 
A higher percentage of patients in the TPC group compared with the SG group were randomised but not 
treated (14.5% and 3.4%, respectively). Similarly, a higher proportion of patients discontinued treatment 
due to withdrawal of consent in the TPC group than in the SG group (6.9% vs. 1.9% in the ITT population, 
respectively). No further information on the reasons for non-treatment of randomised patients were collected 
at study enrolment.

Changes to the Statistical Analysis Plan 
The statistical analysis plan was amended several times. The main changes regarding the statistical analysis 
plan were the implementation of the BM-ve population in the testing hierarchy, the increase in sample size, 
and the removal of the planned PFS interim analysis. At the end of the study after the data base cutoff the 
statistical analysis plan was adapted for declaring the interim OS-analysis to the final analysis.

Patients with locally advanced TNBC were allowed to be enrolled with protocol amendment 4 (May 2018), 
while the initial study protocol required metastatic disease. Only a single participant had unresectable locally 
advanced cancer at the time of study entry in Study IMMU-132-05.  
BRCA mutational status were collected at study entry only if available and testing was not required providing 
information for 65% of the population. Only 8.1% of study participants (n=43) were tested positive for 
BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. Available efficacy data by BRCA status suggest a similar treatment effect across 
subgroups, although the results do not allow any firm conclusions due to the small number of patients with 
BRCA positive status (see subgroup results below). 
The most frequent prior systemic therapies in the SG and TPC groups were cyclophosphamide (82.8% and 
82.4%), anthracycline (81.3% vs. 83.2%), paclitaxel (76.4% and 80.2%), carboplatin (61.4% and 68.3%) 
and capecitabine (64% vs 69.8%, respectively in the ITT population). Overall, 29.6% and 28.2% of the 
patients in the SG and TPC groups, respectively, had received prior PD-1/PD-L1 therapy.  
The most frequent sites of metastasis in both groups were the liver, lung, and lymph nodes.

Participants with non-evaluable response were imputed as nonresponders and sensitivity analyses on 
efficacy-analysable participants provided confirmed the robustness of the treatment effect of SG. Moreover, 
supportive sensitivity analyses accounting for a higher percentage of randomised but not treated patients in 
the TPC group compared with the SG group. (see participant flow above). 
Clinical Benefit Rate 
CBR was also significantly higher (p<0.0001, p-value nominal) in the SG group than in the TPC group by IRC 
(40.4% versus 8.0%, respectively; Odds Ratio 8.07) and investigator assessment (43.1% versus 9.9%, 
respectively; Odds ratio 7.08) in the ITT Population. 
Sensitivity Analyses of ORR and CBR 
Sensitivity analyses of ORR and CBR in Efficacy Analysable Patients generally confirmed the robustness of 
results by IRC and investigator review in the BM-ve and ITT populations (see clinical AR for details).

Updated data based on final database lock (25 February 2021) 
The final data cutoff 11 March 2020 was in accordance with the number of events in the prespecified final 
analysis planned for the study and included any updates to the data after the DMC review. The final database 
lock (25 February 2021) included further efficacy data collected from the remaining 17 participants after the 
final data cut for the CSR (study participants pending transition to another clinical study) and confirmed the 
findings of the final analysis (see Table 3.3.5.14). The only end point with no change from the final CSR was 
the ORR (independent review).

c.  ORR is defined as the best confirmed overall response of either CR or PR. The best overall response is derived based on independent 
or investigator assessed tumor response at each tumor assessment according to RECIST 1.1. Responses of CR and PR are confirmed 
no less than 4 weeks later. Exact binomial CI for proportion is based on the Beta distribution. P Value is based on 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test.

Quality of life 
The analysis of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life 
Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC-QLQ-C30) using a linear mixed effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) 
analysis was performed to assess the extent of missing quality of life (QoL) data over time and estimate the 
treatment differences on the change from baseline scores in all functions and symptom domains (data cutoff 
11 March 2020).

Hazard ratio and p-value are from an unstratified Cox regression analysis 
Note: 
Exploratory bivariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses for the BM-ve and ITT Populations confirmed 
the robustness of the PFS and OS results seen with SG in various subgroups. 
Additional not prespecified subgroup analyses showed a consistent treatment effect for SG compared with 
TPC irrespective of the number of prior therapies for TNBC (1 line in metastatic setting, >1 L; 2, >2), prior 
treatment with a PARPi, prior anthracycline treatment, prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment, and in 
patients with BRCA 1/2 status unknown. Results suggest a lack of cross-resistance between prior therapies 
and SG.  
Brain metastasi- positive patients  
Although not a prespecified analysis population in the SAP for Study IMMU-132-05, data were also analysed 
separately for the brain metastasis positive population (BM-pos. Pop.; n=61). 
Demographic and baseline disease characteristics 
There was no meaningful difference in demographics or baseline disease characteristics between the SG and 
TPC groups in subjects with brain metastases at baseline, although the numbers were more variable due to 
the smaller sample size. As to be anticipated, patients with brain metastases were more pre-treated and 
appeared to have more advanced disease compared with the ITT population (proportion of patients with >3 
prior chemotherapies 42.6% vs 31%, median number of prior systemic therapies 5 vs 4, time from diagnosis 
of stage 4 to study entry median 22.5 months vs 16.2 months, proportion of patients with lung metastasis 
67.2% vs 46.5%, proportion of patients with bone metastasis 36% vs 24% in the brain metastasis positive 
population compared to the ITT population, respectively).

Efficacy results  
PFS 
In patients with brain metastasis at baseline, median PFS was similar in the SG and TPC groups by IRC 
assessment (2.8 and 1.6 months, respectively) and by investigator assessment (2.9 and 2.8 months, 
respectively); HRs were 0.65 by IRC and 0.85 by investigator assessment.

In patients with brain metastases at baseline, 1 patient in the SG group (PR) and no patients in the TPC

with the TPC arm. Duration of response was reported as 2.9 months for the single responder in the SG arm.

Table 38 Analysis of ORR - Independent Review BM Positive Population 
Participants were included in the BM-positive population regardless of present brain metastasis at enrolment 
or only a history of brain metastasis. 32 participants had brain metastases at enrolment by IRC 
assessment (n=14 in the SG arm and n=18 in the TPC arm). An overview of efficacy results for this 
subgroup of patients with present brain metastasis at enrolment showed overall consistent results with those 
in the BM-positive population. For patients with present brain metastasis the stratified HRs for PFS by IRC 
and OS were 0.59 (n=32; 95% CI: 0.27, 1.30) and 0.81 (95% CI: 0.37, 1.78), respectively. The median PFS 
was 3.2 months vs 1.6 months; the median OS was 8.0 months vs 7.5 months, in patients treated with 
sacituzumab govitecan and TPC, respectively. Response assessments of brain metastasis for the 32 
participants with brain metastases at baseline did not provide conclusive results, since brain lesions were to 
be considered non-target lesions and consistent follow-up was not available for all patients.

Treatment of physician’s choice (TPC) was determined before randomisation. Exploratory results for ORR 
were provided for patients treated with each of the single-agent treatments. Since most of the patients 
received eribulin in the control arm (n=122), numbers of subjects treated with capecitabine, vinorelbine, or 
gemcitabine were rather small (between n= 28 and 43). The ORR results by TPC were in the same range with 
overlapping confidence intervals. The applicant provided additional efficacy analyses of PFS, OS and ORR 
stratified by physician’s choice of chemotherapy agent prior to randomisation, which showed consistent 
treatment effects between the subgroups (results not shown here).

In vitro biomarker test for patient selection for efficacy  
SG binds to trophoblast cell surface antigen-2 (Trop-2), a transmembrane calcium signal transducer that is 
overexpressed in many epithelial cancers, including TNBC.  
Trop-2 expression was assessed in sections from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks of tissue using a 
qualitative immunohistochemical assay and conventional light microscopy. At the cellular level, membrane 
localisation was expected to predominate, with some degree of cytoplasmic localisation possible. The 
approximate number of viable tumor cells in a section had to be ≥100 cells for Trop-2 evaluation. Scoring 
included all areas of evaluable viable tumor in the section, even if the tumor was discontinuous or in separate 
tissue fragments in the section. Necrotic areas, poorly preserved areas, poorly fixed areas, and areas 
exhibiting artifactual changes were excluded from scoring. Membrane and cytoplasmic staining intensity was 
characterised as follows.  
Clinical Validation: 
SG is in principle a targeted therapy directed against Trop-2. Information about the predictive value of the 
biomarker Trop-2 was limited at initiation of the clinical development plan. Although it is acknowledged that 
Trop-2 is quite ubiquitous expressed in TNBC and a preselection of patients was not considered necessary for 
this Phase III study, the applicant was advised to further assess the correlation between Trop-2 expression 
and response to get as much information as possible from the pivotal study IMMU-132-05. Please refer also 
to the draft anticancer guideline rev.6 Biomarker section.

EMA/623887/2021 
Page 102/159 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Exploratory data from the uncontrolled, Phase 1/2 basket study IMMU-132-01 suggested a predictive value of 
Trop-2 expression for patients with TNBC: ORR 16.7% vs. 40.4%, median PFS 2.7 months vs. 6.1 months 
and median OS 9.4 months vs. 13.7 months for patients with no/weak vs moderate/strong Trop-2 
expression, respectively However, the numbers (n=6, 57 and 45) were too small to draw conclusions. In 
addition, Trop-2 expression was determined using an exploratory, unvalidated immunohistochemical assay 
based on a polyclonal antibody by an analyst not qualified in immunohistochemical evaluation.  
In Study IMMU-132-05 Trop-2 status was assessed using a validated qualitative immunohistochemical assay 
based on a monoclonal antibody. However, collection of baseline tumor biopsies was not mandated for Study 
IMMU-132-05. Thus, tumor samples were available from only 364 of 529 participants (68.8%) in the ITT 
population. Of these, tumor samples from 46 participants failed the Trop-2 IHC test mostly due to insufficient 
number of tumor cells (tumor cells <100 in 38 samples) or technical issues (n=5) or “not done” (n=3), 
resulting in a proportion of 60.1% (n=318) with Trop-2 expression results in the ITT. 
The applicant presented retrospective comparative analyses indicating similar baseline characteristics and 
efficacy outcomes between the subset of the study population evaluable for Trop-2 status and the overall BM-
negative population to support the assumption that the subset of Trop-2–evaluable participant population 
would be representative. The requested Trop-2 sensitivity analyses were all conducted in the BM-negative 
population (with 290 participants evaluable for Trop-2 IHC staining [62% of BM-ve population]) and not in 
the ITT population (318 evaluable participants).  
Data were analysed using different scoring methods: a) the membrane H-score that considered both, the 
intensity of the staining and the number of tumor cells with a membrane staining, b) the percent membrane 
cells I2+I3 that count the percentage of tumor cells with a membrane staining of moderate or high staining 
intensity and c) the total membrane score which simply adds the percentages of tumor cells with any Trop-2 
expression (i.e. independent from the staining intensity). Although the total membrane score showed not to 
be optimal for discerning the impact of Trop-2 expression levels on efficacy, results of analyses of PFS, OS, 
and ORR by Trop-2 expression level were consistent across different scoring methods. 
Efficacy results by Trop-2 Subgroups (excerpt) are summarised below:

Treatment:  
Patients received SG 10 mg/kg as a slow IV infusion on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day treatment cycle.  
Endpoints:  
ORR by investigator assessment using RECIST v1.1 criteria was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints 
included DOR, TTR, CBR, and PFS by investigator assessment as well as OS.  
Patient Disposition and Characteristics 
Study IMMU-132-01 was conducted at 13 centers in the US. Results from the final analysis are based on the 
database cut-off date of 01 March 2019. 
Most patients in the TNBC Target Population have permanently discontinued SG (97.2%), with PD (78.7%) as 
the most frequent reason for treatment discontinuation. The majority have discontinued the study (90.7%), 
with death (80.6%) as the most frequent reason for study discontinuation. 
Patients were predominantly ≤65 years old (87.0%), female (99.1%), White (75.9%), and had an ECOG PS 
of 1 (71.3%). Patients in the TNBC Target Population were heavily pretreated (median number of 3 previous 
anticancer regimens). Prior therapies included platinum (76.9% of patients) gemcitabine (54.6%), 
capecitabine (50.9%), and eribulin (45.4%). The mean duration of the immediate previous anticancer 
regimen was 3.7 months.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The application for sacituzumab govitecan (SG) for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is 
based on the pivotal Study IMMU-132-05. This is an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial of SG versus 
treatment of physician’s choice (TPC) in patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC who 
received at least two prior treatments. Supportive data were provided from Study IMMU-132-01, an 
uncontrolled phase 1/2 basket trial that included a cohort of 108 mTNBC patients after at least 2 prior 
therapies for metastatic disease. Single-agent chemotherapy according to physician’s choice were to be 
determined prior to randomisation and included several options, as there is no definitive standard of care in 
the proposed treatment setting for the targeted patient population. The choice of comparator treatments, 
either eribulin, capecitabine, gemcitabine, or vinorelbine and the selected dosing regimens are in line with 
international guideline recommendations (e.g. ESMO and NCCN); Given the different treatment options in the 
control arm, the open-label design is acceptable. Stratification factors were number of prior lines of therapies 
[2-3 vs >3], known brain metastasis and region [North America vs Europe]. The study design of IMMU-132-
05 is endorsed. 
The eligibility criteria were overall adequate to select an advanced TNBC population. Diagnosis of TNBC were 
to be confirmed per ASCO/CAP criteria (using a cutoff of <1% for ER and PR negativity) based on local 
assessment of the most recent biopsy.  
The choice of PFS as primary endpoint and OS as secondary endpoint as well as the proposed hierarchical 
testing of PFS/OS in the ITT had been accepted by CHMP in previous Scientific Advice received by the 
applicant. With protocol amendment 4 (May 2018; first patient enrolled Nov 2017), the analysis plan was 
changed to analyse the primary endpoint of PFS by IRC assessment first in patients without known brain 
metastases, the brain metastasis negative (BM-ve) Population. If the primary analysis was significant, 
subsequent key secondary endpoints (OS in the BM-ve population, PFS by IRC assessment in the ITT 
population, OS in the ITT population) were tested in a sequential manner. As clarified at the presubmission 
meeting, the statistical analysis was modified based on input by FDA to address the uncertain efficacy in 
patients with brain metastases (considering the MoA of SG as an antibody drug conjugate with uncertain 
crossing of the blood-brain barrier).  
Other secondary efficacy objectives (ORR, DOR, CBR, and QoL) are standard in oncology trials and endorsed. 
No PFS2 data were provided; however, this can be accepted in view of the favourable OS results (see below). 
The analysis of efficacy by Trop-2 tumor expression, the target of SG, was introduced as exploratory analysis 
with amendment 4 (May 2018). However, obviously eligibility criteria were not adapted to ensure that all 
patients had to provide tumor biopsies for central testing of Trop-2 expression. 
Recruitment, study conduct and baseline characteristics  
The study randomised 529 patients 1:1 in both treatment arms. At the data cut-off date of 11 March 2020, 
the median survival follow-up in the ITT population was 8.4 months (10.6 months for SG and 6.3 for TPC). A 
higher percentage of patients in the TPC group compared with the SG group were randomised but not treated

(14.5% and 3.4%, respectively) or discontinued treatment due to withdrawal of consent (6.9% vs. 1.9%, 
respectively). In view of the open-label study, this is likely due to patients´ expectations of receiving 
experimental treatment, yet this imbalance might have impacted efficacy outcomes. At request the applicant 
provided a conservative sensitivity analysis (tipping point analysis) that confirmed the robustness of the 
results for PFS, OS and ORR with regard to worse-case imputation of non-treated randomised patients. This 
is reassuring considering the lower than anticipated PFS and OS results in the control arm. 
Patients with brain metastasis were allowed if adequately pre-treated, stable for at least 4 weeks and without 
high-dose steroids or anti-seizure medication. According to information at randomisation, 61 patients (11.5% 
of study population) were considered to be brain metastases-positive. Of note, 26 patients failed screening 
due to lack of stable CNS disease, suggesting that the extensive and detailed inclusion criteria limited the 
number of patients included with this disease manifestation. It would have been preferred to perform an MRI 
of the brain for all patients at baseline, considering that the incidence of brain metastases is high in the 
targeted patient population. This would have allowed a better estimation of activity of SG in the brain. With 
the response to the D90 LoQ the selected criteria for stable brain metastases have been adequately reflected 
in the SmPC. 
Inconsistencies were noted in the dossier regarding the reported number of patients with brain metastases. 
While the BM-positive population included n=32 in SG arm and n=29 in the TPC arm, 31 patients in the TPC 
arm were reported to have received prior radiotherapy to the brain (Table 29) and only 33 patients and not 
all 61 patients in the brain metastasis positive population were reported to have tumor locations in the brain 
based on IRC assessment (Table 30). In response to the D90 LoQ the applicant clarified that due to 
erroneous entries in the Eligibility Review Forms during randomisation, two patients with brain metastasis in 
the TPC group were not included in the BM-positive population. Moreover, participants were considered 
positive for brain metastasis (included in the BM-positive population) regardless of present brain metastasis 
or only a history of brain metastasis (e.g. prior brain radiotherapy or cancer-related surgery). Consequently, 
only 32 of 61 participants in the BM-positive population had baseline tumor locations in the brain based on 
IRC assessment.  
An imbalance on withdrawals was noted. A conservative sensitivity analysis addressing the potential impact 
of the imbalance on the efficacy outcome was provided. The results of a tipping point analyses confirmed the 
robustness of the results for PFS, OS and ORR with regard to worse-case imputation of non-treated 
randomised patients. Only in a very unrealistic scenario the statistical inference flipped from being significant 
to being insignificant for the SG group. 
Failure of at least two prior standard-of-care chemotherapy regimens was required for recruitment, including 
at least one prior therapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease and including a taxane in any setting. 
Earlier (neo)adjuvant therapy qualified as 1 of the required prior regimens in case of disease recurrence 
within 12-months after completion of chemotherapy. Next to taxanes, also anthracyclines and platinum 
compound are considered important and efficacious options in earlier lines. For enrolment in IMMU-132-05 
only prior treatment with a taxane was required, but it is acknowledged that the majority of patients had 
received prior anthracyclines (82%) and platinum compounds (77%). Anthracyclines appeared to be applied 
only in the (neo)adjuvant setting in clinical practice. Subgroup analyses showed a similar treatment effect of 
SG independent from prior therapies.  
Demographics and baseline disease characteristics were generally balanced between both treatment arms 
and reflected a heavily pre-treated patient population with a median number of 4 prior systemic therapy 
regimens. The low number of male patients (n=2) is considered acceptable, since breast cancer is rare in 
Assessment report  
EMA/623887/2021 
Page 110/159 
 
 
 
men and the results from the pivotal trial is considered extrapolatable to men with mTNBC in line with 
previous EMA decisions.  
Based on more detailed information in response to the D90 LoQ, numbers and distribution of important 
protocol deviations and provided rationale and background for implemented changes of the protocol and SAP 
were not considered to have a relevant impact on the study results. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The primary analysis of PFS by IRC assessment in the BM-ve population as well as secondary endpoints of 
PFS by IRC assessment in the ITT population and OS in both the BM-ve and the ITT populations were 
statistically significant and demonstrated clinically meaningful superiority of SG over TPC (ITT population: 
PFS HR 0.43 [95% CI 0.35, 0.54]; OS HR 0.51 [95% CI 0.41, 0.62], median OS 12.1 vs 6.7 months for SG 
compared to TPC). Sensitivity analyses of PFS supported the robustness of the treatment effect of SG. The 
data were sufficiently mature (OS event rates 66% in the SG arm and 79% in the TPC arm).  
ORR by IRC and investigator assessment in the BM-ve and ITT Populations favoured SG over TPC (p-values 
nominal); nonetheless, the applicant was asked to clarify the high proportion of 30.5% of patients not 
evaluable for response evaluation in the TPC arm (s. Table 3.3.5.10). More participants in the TPC arm 
(n=71) were not evaluable for response than in the SG arm (n=18). A total of 62.0% (44 of 71) of 
participants in the TPC treatment group were not evaluable for response because they were either 
randomised but never treated or withdrew consent before the first postbaseline efficacy assessment. This is 
likely related to the preference of patients receiving SG instead of SOC treatment in the open-label study. 
DOR by IRC and investigator assessment in the BM-ve and ITT Populations favoured SG over TPC; however, 
results for duration of response are not considered meaningful in the TPC group in view of the low number of 
responders and the even lower number of patients with an event. 
Results of ORR and CBR supported the benefit of SG with superior treatment effects in both analyses 
populations (ITT and BM-ve) by IRC and investigator-based assessments. Quality of life, assessed using the 
EORTC-QoL-C30, showed overall similar results between both treatment arms with the exception of a 
clinically meaningful worsening of diarrhoea; however, interpretation of PRO data are hampered by the open-
label study design and therefore not included in the SmPC.  
The applicant provided updated data from the final database lock (25 February 2021), which included further 
efficacy data collected from the remaining 17 participants after the final data cut for the CSR (11 March 
2020). Clinically relevant endpoints of PFS, OS and ORR were consistent with the original submission and 
updated PFS and OS data are adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
Results of subgroup analyses showed consistent effects across different age groups, regions, prior treatments 
(including prior checkpoint inhibitors or PARP-inhibitors), original diagnosis of TNBC, and presence of liver 
metastases. 
However, due to the small number of patients with BRCA positive status (n=43; 8.1%) no firm conclusions 
can be drawn from these results. Since testing was not required, information on BRCA mutational status was 
lacking for 35% of study population. This is reflected in the SmPC.   
Efficacy results were similar in both treatment arms for patients with known brain metastasis. In the BM-
positive population (n=61) stratified HRs for PFS were 0.65 [0.35, 1.22] by IRC and 0.86 [0.45, 1.60] by INV 
assessment; the stratified OS HR was 0.87 [0.47, 1.63], the median OS was 6.8 months in the SG arm and 
Assessment report  
EMA/623887/2021

7.5 months in the TPC arm. In response to the D90 LoQ the applicant clarified that participants were 
considered positive for brain metastasis regardless of present brain metastasis at enrolment or only a history 
of brain metastasis. 32 of 61 participants in the BM-positive population had baseline tumor locations in the 
brain based on IRC assessment. The efficacy results for this subgroup of patients with present brain 
metastasis at enrolment showed overall consistent results with those in the BM-positive population. Despite 
the recognised methodological limitations of these retrospective analyses in subgroups with small sample 
size, it is reassuring that results do not indicate a detrimental effect of SG relative to TPC for patients with 
brain metastasis.  
The reported median OS for patients with brain metastasis in the control arm is in the upper range of what 
was reported for TNBC patients with brain metastasis in historical controls (between 3 and 6 months, e.g. 
Pestalozzi, 2009) and it was somewhat unexpected that the median OS in the TPC arm for patients with brain 
metastasis was not lower compared to the ITT population or the BM-ve population (7.5 months vs. 6.9 
months vs. 6.7 months, respectively). In this context it is again highlighted that only patients with stable and 
pre-treated brain metastases were enrolled. For these patients the treatment effect of SG on simultaneous 
peripheral metastases might be relevant for determining the individual prognosis even if there are 
uncertainties about the effect of SG in the brain. Given the overall non-detrimental efficacy of SG in patients 
with brain metastasis compared to TPC, SG can be considered as an alternative treatment option.  
Available data do not raise concerns regarding a lower treatment effect in elderly; however, data for patients 
≥75 are too limited to draw conclusions. The limited data for this age group has been described in section 4.2 
of the SmPC.    
Paediatric patients or patients with moderate or severe hepatic or renal impairment were not included in the 
clinical studies. The lack of these data is adequately reflected in the SmPC. An open-label, non-randomised, 
dose-escalation study, IMMU-132-15, to determine an appropriate starting dose of SG in patients with 
moderate hepatic impairment is ongoing and anticipated to be completed by December 2021 with the final 
report available by Q3 2022.  
Initially provided exploratory analyses of efficacy by Trop-2 tumor expression showed a treatment benefit of 
SG in tumors above and below the chosen cut-off for Trop-2 expression but these results suggested a 
predictive value of Trop-2 expression. The selected method and the single cut-off to determine Trop-2 tumor 
expression status was not considered sufficient to determine the benefit in patients with tumors that show 
only a weak or no TROP-2 expression. This is of relevance in view of the MoA of SG as targeted therapy and 
the proportion of about 20% of patients with TNBC without overexpression of Trop-2 according to literature 
data.  
Trop-2 expression data were provided for only 60% of study populations (although the importance of the 
evaluation was highlighted during EMA and national SA meetings). The main reason for the limited number of 
participants with evaluable tumor samples for Trop-2 expression was that collection of baseline tumor 
biopsies was not mandated for Study IMMU-132-05.  
Overall results (HRs for PFS and OS as well as odds ratios for ORR) showed a benefit of SG over the 
treatment of physician’s choice (TPC) for all participants; however, the treatment effect of SG was 
consistently smaller in the lowest quartile Q1 and subgroups with low Trop-2 expression (H-scores <100, 
percent membrane cells I2+I3 scores ≤50 and total membrane scores ≤50) than in the higher quartiles. 
Efficacy results in subjects with low Trop-2 expression showed an increased variability with the 95% CIs 
crossing 1, but numerically, the point estimates of HRs were beneficial for SG over TPC for both PFS and OS. 
Assessment report  
EMA/623887/2021 
Page 112/159 
 
 
 
This was also supported by ORR results that showed lower values for SG in lower Trop-2 expression groups, 
but these were still superior compared to those for TPC.  
An association between Trop-2 tumor expression and efficacy outcome could be shown with a smaller 
treatment effect in subgroups with low relative to participants with high Trop-2 expression. However, 
conclusions on the clinical relevance of different levels of tumor Trop-2 expression for the treatment with SG 
are hampered by the retrospective character of the analyses and the limited sample size of the Trop-2–
evaluable population (with even smaller numbers per quartile). Therefore, available data do not support a 
restricted indication. Efficacy of SG appeared superior compared to the control arm also for patients with low 
Trop-2 expression. 
The initially proposed indication wording does not refer to any specific agent when defining required prior 
treatment; however, subgroup analyses indicated a treatment effect of SG independent of prior treatment 
(see above) and the open wording allows more flexibility regarding changes in clinical practise. The 
requirement of prior taxane therapy is reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. As requested, the applicant 
revised the indication to reflect the target population more clearly (in bold the new text and strikethrough the 
deletions): 
Trodelvy as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable locally advanced 
or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) who have received at least two or more prior systemic 
therapies, including at least one of them prior therapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease (see 
section 5.1). 
The indication wording encompasses the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic TNBC; yet 
only a single participant was enrolled with unresectable locally advanced cancer in Study IMMU-132-05. The 
applicant argued that the low number was not unexpected, as the natural history of locally advanced breast 
cancer is progression to distant metastatic disease with each line of therapy. ESMO clinical practice guidelines 
do not distinguish between unresectable locally advanced and metastatic breast cancer treatment paradigms 
due to the similar biological and demographic characteristics, but provide treatment recommendations for 
“advanced breast cancer”. In view of the high unmet medical need and expected similar treatment benefits 
for patients with unresectable disease, who are eligible for systemic treatment, the extrapolation of data is 
considered acceptable in line with other approved breast cancer indications in the EU. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
A clinically meaningful benefit in progression free and overall survival was demonstrated in the intended 
target population of patients with advanced TNBC and at least 2 prior systemic therapies.  
Provided subgroup results for patients considered as brain metastasis positive (n=61) indicated a similar 
benefit of SG compared to control. Despite remaining uncertainties about the treatment effect on brain 
metastasis, the benefit of SG in distant metastases can be clinically relevant for patients with pretreated and 
stable brain metastasis and SG is considered as a treatment option also in this population.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The clinical safety data supporting this Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) are derived from 2 clinical 
studies:  
Assessment report  
EMA/623887/2021 
Page 113/159 
 
 
 
 
1) a Phase 1/2 basket study, IMMU-132-01, that included a cohort of patients with mTNBC that received a 
starting dose of 10 mg/kg SG and  
2) a confirmatory Phase 3 study in patients with mTNBC, IMMU-132-05, that evaluated SG at a starting dose 
of 10 mg/kg compared with single-agent chemotherapy (ie, treatment of physician’s choice [TPC]; either 
eribulin, capecitabine, gemcitabine, or vinorelbine). 
Safety data are also provided for 2 pools:  
1) pooled data from triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients who received 10 mg/kg SG in either the 
IMMU-132-01 or IMMU-132-05 study; this pool is referred to as the Overall Targeted TNBC pool and 
includes 366 patients and 
2) all patients treated with an SG starting dose of 10 mg/kg in either of the clinical studies; IMMU-132-01 or 
IMMU-132-05 this pool is referred to as the All Treated pool and includes 660 patients.  
The safety database cut-off date of the initial submission was 11 March 2020. With the responses to the first 
round of question the applicant provided treatment and follow-up durations and safety data were provided 
using the final database lock for both IMMU-132-01 (final database lock 02 April 2021) and IMMU-132-05 
(final database lock 25 February 2021). As of the prior data DCO date of 11 March 2020, there were no 
participants continuing SG treatment in Study IMMU-132-01, and 17 participants continuing treatment in the 
SG group in Study IMMU-132-05, and no participants in the TPC group Overall, the updated safety and 
treatment and follow-up duration data are similar to the 11 March 2020 DCO data, therefore, the tables 
included refer to the DCO Date of 11 March 2020 unless otherwise indicated (updated safety data 
02/04/2021(IMMU-132-01) 25/02/2021(IMMU-132-05)).

CTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse events; SAE = serious adverse event; SG = sacituzumab govitecan; 
TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse event; TNBC = triple-negative breast cancer; TPC = treatment of physician’s choice  
Percentages are based on big N. For each row category, a participant with 2 or more adverse events in that category is counted only once. 
Participants may be counted in multiple categories.  
Treatment-related TEAEs include TEAEs that were considered by the Investigator to be related or probably related to study drug or 
TEAEs with a missing causality. 
Adverse events were graded using CTCAE version 5.0. 
The percentage of patients with at least one AE was similar in the SG and TPC groups (99.6% vs 97.8%) in 
Study IMMU-132-05. The most frequent AEs in the SG group compared with the TPC group in Study IMMU-

AE = adverse event; CTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events; MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities; PT = preferred term; SG = sacituzumab govitecan; TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse event; TPC = treatment of physician’s 
choice 
The denominator for percentages is the number of participants in the Safety Population for each treatment group. 
A TEAE is defined as an AE with start date on or after the date of first dose of study treatment and up to 30 days after date of last dose of 
study treatment. 
If a participant had 2 or more AEs in the same system organ class (or with the same preferred term) with different CTCAE grades, then 
the event with the highest grade was used for that participant. Participants with missing CTCAE grade for a nonfatal AE are counted 
under ‘missing’ category unless the participant already has another AE with CTCAE grade of 4, in which case the participant is counted 
under CTCAE grade of 4. 
AE terms were coded using MedDRA version 23.0. 
For summary purposes, the following PTs have been re-coded. Neutrophil count decreased to neutropenia, white blood cell count 
decreased to leukopenia, lymphocyte count decreased to lymphopenia, hemoglobin decreased and red blood cell count decreased to 
anemia, and platelet count decreased to thrombocytopenia.

The table below provides background and justification for inclusion of adverse events as ADRs in the 
proposed product information, presented by System Organ Class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) (or pooled

Hypersensitivity occurred in a higher percentage of patients in the SG group compared with the TPC group 
(34.1% vs 20.5%) in Study IMMU-132-05.  
The most frequent hypersensitivity events in both the SG and TPC groups were cough (7.4% vs 6.7%, 
respectively) and dyspnea (7.0% vs 6.7%, respectively). Most of the cases of hypersensitivity were 
nonsevere, nonserious, and did not lead to either treatment discontinuation interruption, or a dose reduction.

If a patient had two or more adverse events in the same system organ class (or with the same preferred term) with different 
CTCAE grades, then the event with the highest grade was used for that patient. Patients with a missing CTCAE grade for a 
non-fatal AE were counted under the ‘missing’ category, unless the patient already had another AE with CTCAE grade of 4, 
in which case patient was counted under CTCAE grade of 4. 
Adverse Events terms were coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 23.0. 
Neutrophil count decreased', 'White blood cell count decreased', 'Lymphocyte count decreased', 'Hemoglobin decreased', 
'Red blood cell count decreased' and 'Platelet count decreased' have been re-coded to Neutropenia, Leukopenia, 
Lymphopenia, Anemia, and Thrombocytopenia, correspondingly, for summary purposes.

TNBC = triple-negative breast cancer; TPC = treatment of physician’s choice 
Percentages are based on big N. 
If a participant had 2 or more adverse events in the same system organ class (or with the same preferred term) with different CTCAE 
grades, then the event with the highest grade was used for that participant. Participants with a missing CTCAE grade for a non-fatal AE 
were counted under the ‘missing’ category unless the participant already had another AE with CTCAE grade of 4, in which case the 
participant was counted under CTCAE grade of 4. 
AE terms were coded using MedDRA version 23.0. 
For summary purposes, the following PTs have been re-coded. Neutrophil count decreased to neutropenia, white blood cell count 
decreased to leukopenia, lymphocyte count decreased to lymphopenia, hemoglobin decreased and red blood cell count decreased to 
anemia, and platelet count decreased to thrombocytopenia.

Liver Function 
Mean and median changes from baseline in liver function tests were similar over time for the SG and TPC 
groups in Study IMMU-132-05. Additionally, grade 3 and grade 4 increases in ALT, AST, alkaline 
phosphatase, and total bilirubin were seen in a similar percentage of patients in the SG and TPC groups in 
Study IMMU-132-05.  
An evaluation of drug-induced serious hepatotoxicity plot of peak total bilirubin versus peak serum ALT for 
the Overall Target TNBC pool is provided in Figure below.  
Overall, 5 patients with mTNBC and 3 patients with a different metastatic epithelial cancer who received 10 
mg/kg SG in Study IMMU-132-01 had AST or ALT >3x ULN with concurrent total bilirubin >2x ULN within 30 
days of study drug discontinuation, and thus, met the laboratory criteria for a potential Hy’s law case. All of 
these patients were evaluated for evidence of drug-induced liver injury, including whether or not the liver 
injury was primarily hepatocellular without a prominent cholestatic component and for the presence of 
alternative etiologies. None of the patients were found to meet the criteria for drug-induced liver injury 
because alternative etiologies, including progression of liver metastases, bile duct obstruction due to 
metastatic disease, concomitant medications, and cholecystitis, were present. 
Kidney Function 
Grade 3 or grade 4 changes in creatinine were seen in a low and similar percentage of patients in the SG and 
TPC groups in Study IMMU-132-05. Additionally, the percentage of SG-treated patients with a grade 3 or 
grade 4 change in creatinine and the worst grade on study was similar in Studies IMMU-132-01 and IMMU-
132-05 and the Overall Target TNBC and All Treated Pools.

Mean and median changes from baseline in electrolytes and glucose were similar over time in the SG and TPC 
groups  in  Study  IMMU-132-05.  Additionally,  grade  3  or  grade  4  increases  or  decreases  in  electrolytes  and 
glucose were seen in a low and similar percentage of patients in the SG and TPC groups in Study IMMU-132-
05. Changes from baseline in electrolytes and glucose in SG-treated patients were also similar in Studies IMMU-
132-01 and IMMU-132-05 and in the overall target TNBC and all treated Pools. The percentage of SG-treated 
patients with a grade 3 or grade 4 increase or decrease in electrolytes and glucose and the worst grade on 
study  was  similar  in  Studies  IMMU-132-01  and  IMMU-132-05  and  the  Overall  Target  TNBC  and  All  Treated 
Pools.

Vital Signs 
Mean and median changes from baseline over time in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, 
respiration rate, and body temperature were similar in the SG and TPC groups in Study IMMU-132-05. 
Changes from baseline over time for vital signs were also similar in SG-treated patients in studies IMMU-132-
01 and IMMU-132-05 and in the overall target TNBC and all treated Pools 
ECG 
Mean and median changes from baseline over time in ventricular rate and the QT, QTcB, QTcF, PR, QRS, and 
RR intervals were similar in the SG and TPC groups in Study IMMU-132-05. Changes from baseline over time 
for ECG parameters were also similar in SG-treated patients in studies IMMU-132-01 and IMMU-132-05 and in 
the overall target TNBC and all treated pools. A slightly higher percentage of patients in the SG group compared 
with the TPC group in Study IMMU-132-05 had treatment-emergent maximum QTcB and QTcF changes >60 
msec and QTcB values of >500 msec (Table 38).   
All patients with a QTcF >500 msec and/or QTcF change >60 msec or a cardiac AE in Study IMMU-132-05 were 
reviewed by an independent cardiologist; the review for each patient is provided in the CSR of IMMU-132-05. 
For  each  of  these  patients,  the  QTc  prolongation  was  a  small  increase  from  baseline  and  the  patient  was 
receiving a concomitant medication that is known to prolong QTc. Additionally, no evidence for QTc prolongation 
was seen for SG in the PK-QTc substudy of Study IMMU-132-05. 
The percentage of patients with a QTcF >500 msec and/or QTcF change >60 msec was similar in SG-treated 
patients in studies IMMU-132-01 and IMMU-132-05 and in the overall target TNBC and all treated pools.

The majority of patients in the SG and TPC groups in Study IMMU-132-05 were either <50 years (35.7% vs 
31.7%) or 50 to 64 years (45.3% vs 46.9%); approximately 20% of patients in the SG and TPC groups were 
≥65 years (19.0% vs 21.4%). Median duration of SG treatment in Study IMMU-132-05 was similar across the 
age subgroups and was longer for the SG group compared with the TPC group within each age subgroup.   
The overall incidence of each AE was similar across the age subgroups in Study IMMU-132-05 and in the 
pooled TNBC population. However, data are too limited to draw conclusions.

Race 
The majority of patients in the SG and TPC groups in the pivotal study were  White (81.8% vs 76.8%); the 
remainder of patients were Black or African American (9.7% vs 13.8%), Asian (4.3% vs 4.0%), or Other (4.3% 
vs  5.4%).  Similar  race  distributions  were  seen  in  study  IMMU-132-01  and  the  overall  target  TNBC  and  all 
treated pools (Table 11). Median duration of SG treatment was similar across the race subgroups and within 
each race subgroup, median duration of treatment was longer for the SG group compared with the TPC group.  
The overall incidence of AEs, ≥grade 3 AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug across the 
race subgroups was similar in the SG and TPC groups and in either Study IMMU-132-01 or the overall target 
TNBC or all treated pool. Moreover, the incidence of each AE was similar across the race subgroups in study 
IMMU-132-05.  GI  AEs  (nausea  and  diarrhoea)  and  myelosuppressive  AEs  (neutropenia,  febrile  neutropenia, 
and anaemia) were seen in a higher percentage of the SG group compared with the TPC group in each race 
subgroup in Study IMMU-132-05. Additionally, no difference was seen in the incidence of any AE across the 
race subgroups in study IMMU-132-01 and the overall target TNBC and all treated pools. 
Ethnicity 
The majority of patients in the SG and TPC groups in Study IMMU-132-05 were not Hispanic or Latino (88.0% 
vs 86.2%; Table 11). Similar ethnic distributions were seen in study IMMU-132-01 and the overall target TNBC 
and all treated pools. Median duration of SG treatment in the pivotal study was lower in Hispanics or Latinos 
compared with Whites; however, this difference might be a result of the small number of Hispanics or Latinos 
who were enrolled (n=36 in the all treated SG pool). Median duration of treatment was longer for the SG group 
compared with the TPC group in each ethnic subgroup. 
The overall incidence of AEs, ≥grade 3 AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug was similar 
for the 2 ethnic subgroups in the SG and TPC groups in Study IMMU-132-05 and no difference was observed 
across the 2 ethnic subgroups in either study IMMU-132-01 or the overall target TNBC or all treated pool. 
The overall incidence of each AE was generally similar between the 2 ethnic subgroups in the pivotal study. GI 
AEs (nausea and diarrhoea) and myelosuppressive AEs (neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and anaemia) were 
seen in a higher percentage of the SG group compared with the TPC group in each ethnic subgroup. Additionally, 
no difference was observed in the incidence of any AE in the 2 ethnic subgroups in study IMMU-132-01 and the 
overall target TNBC and all treated pools.  
Region 
In the pivotal study, 167 and 91 patients in the SG group and 140 and 84 patients in the TPC group were from 
North America and the ROW, respectively. All patients in Study IMMU-132-01 were from the US. 
Median duration of SG treatment in Study IMMU-132-05 was shorter in North America compared with the ROW 
(4.0 months vs 5.1 months. Median duration of treatment was longer for the SG group compared with the TPC 
group in both regions. The overall incidence of AEs, ≥grade 3 AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation of 
study drug was similar for the 2 regions in the SG and TPC arm of the pivotal study. The overall incidence of 
each AE was generally similar between the 2 regions in Study IMMU-132-05. GI AEs (nausea and diarrhoea) 
and myelosuppressive AEs (neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and anaemia) were seen in a higher percentage 
of the SG arm compared with the TPC arm in each region.

Baseline Hepatic and Renal Function 
Almost all patients in the SG and TPC arms of the pivotal study had normal renal function (100% vs 97.3%) 
and normal hepatic function (98.1% vs 97.3%; Table 11). Similar results were seen in Study IMMU-132-01 
and the overall target TNBC and all treated pools (Table 11). Thus, no conclusions can be drawn about either 
exposure or AEs by baseline hepatic and renal function. 
Potential off-target effect of SG: 
Trop 2- Expression was detected in several tissues. To assess specificity, a tumor micro array (TMA) 
containing 95 normal tissues, in triplicate when possible, was tested. The distribution of positive staining was 
predominantly membrane and in epithelial structures. The applicant was asked to review the toxicities that 
could be likely related to a potential off-target toxicity given the observed Trop-2 expression in tissues (see 
below). However, no specific safety concerns have been identified.

2.6.5.  Immunological events 
The analysis of immunogenicity of SG in serum samples from 106 patients with mTNBC in Study IMMU-132-
01 showed that 2% (2/106) of patients developed treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies (ADA; ie, 
persistent positive at the end of therapy).

2.6.8.  Post marketing experience 
FDA granted accelerated approval for the treatment of adult patients with mTNBC who have received at least 
two prior therapies for metastatic disease and treatment of locally advanced and metastatic urothelial cancer 
following a platinum-containing chemotherapy and a PD-1/PD-L1 Inhibitor in April 2020. SG has not been 
approved in any country or region outside of the US. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Sacituzumab govitecan consists basically of 2 components: the anti-Trop 2 AB sacituzumab and SN-38 (the 
active metabolite of irinotecan). Common AEs known to be associated with sacituzumab are unknown; 
however, Trop-2 is not exclusively overexpressed in cancer cells, but also in some epithelial structures. 
Irinotecan is a cytotoxic agent that inhibits the topoisomerase I. Known common adverse events are 
neutropenia, anaemia and gastrointestinal disorders.  
The clinical safety database consists of results from 660 patients receiving single-agent SG at the proposed 
dose of 10 mg/kg IV, derived primarily from the pivotal, randomised, open-label, Phase III study IMMU 132-
05, which evaluated Sacituzumab govitecan (SG) versus treatment of physician´s choice (TPC), eribulin, 
capecitabine, gemcitabine or vinorelbine. In total, 4 analysis groups of safety data have been presented, 
Assessment report  
EMA/623887/2021 
Page 147/159 
 
 
 
 
 
 
including 2 pooled population analyses, the “overall target TNBC population” (including patients from 2 
studies IMMU 132-01 and IMMU 132-05) and the “all treated SG” including patients who received at least one 
dose of SG 10 mg/kg, and 1 analysis presented by treatment group of the randomised study IMMU 132-05.  
The safety data cut-off date for the pivotal trial (IMMU 132-05) was 11 March 2020. Updated safety data 
were presented for IMMU 132-01 (02 April 2021) and IMMU 132-05 (25 February 2021). The safety database 
at initial submission consisted of 366 TNBC patients exposed to at least one dose of SG of 10 mg/kg, with 
total median treatment duration of 4.9 months. With the updated data, the median duration of treatment in 
Study IMMU-132-05 for the SG group compared with the TPC group was 4.4 months versus 1.3 months A 
higher percentage of the SG group compared with the TPC group received study treatment ≥ 6 months 
(36.8% vs 5.8%) and ≥ 12 months (11.2% vs 0.4%). The median duration of treatment for SG was similar in 
Studies IMMU 132 01 and IMMU 132 05 (5.1 and 4.4 months, respectively) and the median for Overall Target 
TNBC and All Treated pools were 4.9 months and 4.1 months, respectively. Given that the studies were 
conducted in the metastatic setting, the number of patients as well as the duration of exposure is considered 
sufficient to assess the overall safety profile of the drug; however, long term safety data (i.e. exposure of at 
least 12 months) are only available for a limited number (11%) of patients exposed to SG. This observation, 
together with the relatively small dataset of non-randomised patients, must be considered in the 
interpretation of safety data.   
In the pivotal study IMMU 132-05 patients continued treatment until progression of disease requiring 
treatment discontinuation or occurrence of unacceptable AEs. The median treatment duration was higher in 
the SG arm (4.4 months) compared to 1.3 months in the TPC arm. 
Overall, the proportions of patients with any AE and Grade ≥ 3 AEs as well as SAEs, deaths, AEs leading to SG 
discontinuation, reduction or dose delay, were generally consistent among the pivotal study IMMU 132-05, 
the total SG-exposed population and the overall target TNBC group.  
The proportions of patients with any treatment related AE and Grade ≥ 3 AEs were higher in the SG treated 
group compared to the TPC group (TEAEs: 97.7% vs. 85.7% and Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs 72.1% vs. 64.7%). 
In the pivotal Study IMMU 132-05, the more frequently reported treatment-related AEs in the SG arm in 
comparison to the TPC group were diarrhoea (65.1% vs 17.0%), neutropenia (64.0% vs 43.8%), nausea 
(62.4% vs 30.4%), fatigue (51.6% vs 39.7%), alopecia (46.9% vs 16.1%), anaemia (39.5% vs 27.7%), 
constipation (37.2 % vs 23.2%) and vomiting (33.3 % vs 16.1%). Neutropenia was the most common 
Grade ≥ 3 AE; other Grade ≥ 3 AEs occurring in at least 5% of patients were: neutrophil count decreased, 
diarrhoea, anaemia, white blood cell count decreased, febrile neutropenia, fatigue, and dyspnoea.  
A similar frequency of SAEs was observed in the SG arm (26.7%) compared to the TPC arm (28.1%) in the 
pivotal trial. The most common (>2%) SAEs in the SG arm were febrile neutropenia (5%), diarrhoea (3.5%), 
neutropenia (2.7%) and pneumonia (2.7%). In the total SG-exposed safety population 34.7 % of patients 
had reported SAEs which is in line with the frequency observed in the pivotal trial. 
Overall, 261 deaths (71.3%) have been reported in the Overall Target TNBC patient population, mostly 
occurring more than 30 days after last study drug administration. 4.1% of deaths (15 patients) were due to 
causes other than PD. Two AEs leading to death were reported (respiratory failure and metastases to the 
central nervous system).  
Regarding dose reduction, a slightly lower number of AEs leading to dose reduction has been observed in the 
SG arm compared with the TPC arm. The AEs that most frequently led to a reduction of SG included 
neutropenia and diarrhoea. In contrast, AEs leading to a treatment interruption occurred in a higher 
Assessment report

Page 148/159 
 
 
 
percentage of patients in the SG group compared with the TPC group (62.8% vs 38.8%) in Study IMMU-132-
05. Neutropenia was the most frequent AE leading to a treatment interruption in the SG and TPC groups 
(46.1% vs 21.0%). 
Identified and potential risks of treatment with SG were based on the available nonclinical and clinical data 
relating to SG and known toxicities associated with irinotecan.  Events of special interest included 
neutropenia, anaemia, infections, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, hypersensitivity, interstitial lung disease, 
neuropathy and fatigue.   
Neutropenia is an identified risk of SG, and haematologic parameters, including platelets count, must be 
monitored before starting and at regular intervals during SG treatment. Neutropenia is the AE that most 
frequently led to a dose reduction or dose delay of SG. Grade ≥3 neutropenia occurred in 48.4% of all the 
neutropenia cases.  
Anaemia occurred in a higher percentage of patients in the SG group compared with the TPC group (39.5% 
vs 27.7%) in Study IMMU-132-05.  Infections were more frequent in the SG group than the TPC group 
(53.1% vs 35.7%) in Study IMMU-132-05. Infections that were more frequent (approximately ≥5%) with SG 
than TPC included the following: Urinary tract infection (12.8% vs 8.0%), Upper respiratory tract infection 
(12.0% vs 3.1%), and Nasopharyngitis (7.0% vs 2.2%). The location of the infections seems to be related to 
the mechanism of action of SG, as the monoclonal antibody part binds to trophoblast cell surface antigen-2 
(Trop-2), a transmembrane calcium signal transducer that is overexpressed in many epithelial cancers; 
however, this should be further clarified (OC). The most common gastrointestinal AESI was diarrhoea with 
65.1% of the patients with an event of any grade, 11.3% with grade 3 events and 3.5% with SAE.  
In pivotal study IMMU 132-05, hypersensitivity occurred in a higher percentage of patients in the SG group 
compared with the TPC group (34.1% vs 20.5%). The most frequent hypersensitivity events in both the SG 
and TPC groups were cough (7.4% vs 6.7%, respectively) and dyspnoea (7.0% vs 6.7%, respectively). 
Premedication was highly recommended in this study, which is reflected in the SmPC.  
In general, concomitant medications were taken by a significantly higher percentage (more than 20%) of the 
SG group compared with the TPC group. 
The incidence rate of peripheral neuropathy in the SG arm of the pivotal trial (14.7%) was lower compared to 
the rate in the total SG population (18%), while a higher rate (21%) was reported in the TPC group.   
SN-38 (the small molecule moiety of sacituzumab govitecan) is metabolised via UGT1A1. The UGT1A1 *28 
allele is associated with decreased rates of transcription, initiation, expression, and enzyme activity of UDP-
glucuronosyltransferase 1-1. With a decrease in enzyme activity, SN-38 metabolism and hence, 
detoxification, is reduced and the exposure time of active SN-38 in the intestines is prolonged. Individuals 
who are homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele are potentially at increased risk for neutropenia, febrile 
neutropenia, and anaemia from Trodelvy. Approximately 20% of the Black or African American population, 
10% of the White population, and 2% of the East Asian population are homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 
allele. The percentage of patients with ≥grade 3 AEs and treatment-emergent SAEs was higher in patients 
who were homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele compared with patients who were either heterozygous or did 
not have this allele (82.4% vs 70.8% and 69.9%, respectively for grade ≥3 AEs and 38.2% vs. 28.1% and 
22.1%, respectively for SAEs) in Study IMMU-132-05.  AEs that occurred in a higher percentage (>10%) of 
patients who were homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele compared with patients who did not have this allele 
were diarrhoea, anaemia, decreased appetite, cough, constipation, peripheral oedema, and febrile 
neutropenia in study IMMU-132-05. No mandatory testing for the UGT1A1*28 allele before treatment is 
suggested by the applicant. Instead, monitoring of important AEs is recommended for all patients given the 
Assessment report

rate of severe toxicities also in patients without an UGT1A1*28 allele deficiency. Information about the 
increased risk of toxicities for patients with known deficiencies is reflected in the SmPC, and it is stated in the 
SmPC, section 4.4, that testing of UGT1A1 variation status is not recommended, as the AEs of SG will be 
handled the same way for all patients regardless of presence of this gene variation.  
Data on the elderly population are limited. 
No immunogenicity data have been provided yet since the validation of neutralising ADA assays is currently 
still ongoing. The applicant will provide the missing immunogenicity data as a post-authorisation measure. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have been 
included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of SG can be regarded as manageable and overall acceptable in the proposed indication of 
advanced mTNBC. Most severe toxicities are haematological events (severe neutropenia) and gastrointestinal 
disorders with severe diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.  From currently available safety data, it seems that SG 
is tolerable in the target population of pre-treated metastatic TNBC as the rate of discontinuations due to AEs 
is low.

Overall conclusions on risk minimisation measures 
The proposed risk minimisation activities are accepted. 
Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 0.4 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 22.04.2020. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to 
determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that sacituzumab govitecan has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product 
in the European Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers sacituzumab govitecan to be a new active substance as it 
is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Labelling exemptions 
A request to omit certain particulars from the labelling as per Art.63.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC has been 
submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following reasons: 
The QRD Group considered the applicant’s proposal acceptable, provided the concentration after reconstitution 
is also included on the vial label. The applicant should also explore the possibility of including the warning about 
Assessment report  
EMA/623887/2021 
Page 153/159 
 
 
 
visual inspection of the content after reconstitution, and the storage conditions, if feasible. 
The particulars to be omitted as per the QRD Group decision described above will however be included in the 
Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, and translated in all languages but will appear in grey-
shaded to show that they will not be included on the printed materials.  
2.10.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Trodelvy (sacituzumab govitecan) is included in 
the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The revised indication is: 
“Trodelvy as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or 
metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) who have received two or more prior systemic 
therapies, including at least one of them for advanced disease (see section 5.1).”. 
TNBC, defined by a lack of tumor-cell expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), 
and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), accounts for approximately 15% of invasive breast 
cancers. TNBC is more common in younger women and is often associated with visceral metastases, 
aggressive tumour biology, and a poor prognosis. The treatment aim of mTNBC is palliative. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The standard of care for patients with mTNBC remain sequential single-agent chemotherapy, whereas 
combination regimens are recommended for patients who present with visceral crisis. Depending on prior use 
in the (neo)adjuvant setting, recommended first line treatments are taxanes, anthracyclines and also 
platinum compounds. Further therapeutic options include capecitabine, gemcitabine, vinorelbine or eribulin. 
Standard chemotherapy is associated with low response rates (10 to 15%) and short progression-free 
survival (2 to 3 months) among patients with pretreated mTNBC.  
Recently, atezolizumab in combination with nab-paclitaxel has been approved for mTNBC in 1L for patients 
with PD-L1 positive tumours while the PARP inhibitors, olaparib and talazoparib, have been approved for 
patients with TNBC who harbour a germline BRCA 1 or 2 mutation and have been previously treated with 
chemotherapy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/623887/2021 
Page 154/159 
 
 
 
 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The open-label study IMMU-132-05 randomly assigned 529 patients with unresectable locally advanced or 
mTNBC in a 1:1 ratio to receive sacituzumab govitecan (SG) or treatment of physician´s choice (eribulin, 
vinorelbine, gemcitabine, or capecitabine). Patients had received at least 2 prior standard-of care 
chemotherapy regimens. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The  efficacy  results  in  the  BMNeg  population  showed  a  statistical  significant  improvement  of  sacituzumab 
govitecan  over  TPC  in  PFS  and  OS  with  hazard  ratios  (HR)  of  0.41  (n=468;  95%  CI:  0.32,  0.52;  p-value: 
<0.0001) and 0.48 (n=468; 95% CI: 0.38, 0.59; p-value: <0.0001), respectively. The median PFS was 5.6 
months vs 1.7 months; the median OS was 12.1 months vs 6.7 months, in patients treated with sacituzumab 
govitecan and TPC, respectively. The efficacy results in the overall population (ITT principle) were consistent 
with the BMNeg population in the pre-specified final analysis (11 March 2020 cut-off date) PFS and OS with 
hazard ratios (HR) of 0.43 (n=529; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.54; p-value: <0.0001) and 0.51 (n=468; 95% CI: 0.41, 
0.62; p-value: <0.0001), respectively.  
PFS results by investigator assessment and sensitivity analyses of PFS showed consistency with the primary 
analysis. Overall response rates and CBRs support the benefit of SG compared to TPC. In an updated efficacy 
analysis (final database lock 25 February 2021), results were consistent with the pre-specified final analysis. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Results of exploratory analyses by Trop-2 tumour expression were available for only 60% of study 
population. Data indicate a smaller treatment effect of SG in subgroups with low relative to participants with 
high Trop-2 expression; however, efficacy of SG appeared superior compared to the control arm also for 
patients with low Trop-2 expression. Only one patient was enrolled with unresectable locally advanced 
disease; however, extrapolation of efficacy is considered justified.  
Efficacy results appear to be consistent regardless of BRCA positive status; however due to the small number 
of patients with BRCA positive status (n=43; 8.1%) no firm conclusions can be drawn from these results. 
Information on BRCA mutational status was lacking for 35% of study population. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Almost  all  of  the  patients  experienced  adverse  events  in  the  pivotal  study  and  both  safety  pools  and  most 
adverse events were treatment-related. Common AEs were diarrhoea (65.1%), neutropenia (64.0%), nausea 
(62.4%), fatigue (51.6%), alopecia (46.9%) anaemia (39.5%), constipation (37.2 %) and vomiting (33.3 %). 
Neutropenia was the most common Grade ≥ 3 AE; other Grade ≥ 3 AEs occurring in at least 5% of patients 
were: neutrophil count decreased, diarrhoea, anaemia, white blood cell count decreased, febrile neutropenia, 
fatigue, and dyspnoea. 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) were observed with a frequency of 26.7% in the SG arm (26.7%) of the pivotal 
trial.  The  most  common  (>2%)  SAEs  in  the  SG  arm  were  febrile  neutropenia  (5%),  diarrhoea  (3.5%), 
neutropenia (2.7%) and pneumonia (2.7%).  
Assessment report  
EMA/623887/2021 
Page 155/159 
 
 
 
Overall,  261  deaths  (71.3%)  have  been  reported  in  the  Overall  Target  TNBC  patient  population,  mostly 
occurring more than 30 days after last study drug administration. 4.1% of deaths (15 patients) were due to 
causes other than PD. Among the AE leading to death, 2 AEs (respiratory failure, metastases to the central 
nervous system). 
The percentage of patients with an AE leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug was 4.7%. Fatigue 
and pneumonia (0.8% each) were the only AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug that 
occurred in more than 1 patient in the SG group in Study IMMU-132-05. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
•  No data in patients with moderate hepatic impairment have been provided; open-label, non-randomised, 
dose-escalation study, IMMU-132-15, to determine an appropriate starting dose in this population is 
being conducted, with data to inform a labelling update anticipated in 2022 
• 
The median duration of treatment for the all treated pool and the target TNBC pool was 4.1 months and 
4.9 months, respectively (DCO 11 MAR 2020), and approximately a third of the patients in both pools 
were treated for more than 6 months. Only 10.9% and 12.3% were exposed for more than 12 months in 
the two pools, respectively. With updated safety data for IMMU-132-01 (02 April 2021) and IMMU 132-05 
(25 February 2021), the median duration of treatment in Study IMMU-132-05 for the SG group compared 
with the TPC group was 4.4 months versus 1.3 months and the median for Overall Target TNBC and All 
Treated pools were 4.9 months and 4.1 months, respectively. Hence, the median exposure is considered 
short.  
•  Safety according to the UGT1A1 genotype was provided and the applicant claims that inhibitors or 
inducers of UGT1A1 are expected to increase or decrease SN-38 exposure, respectively. This is 
adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
•  Data  on  the  immunogenicity  of  SG  for  the  pivotal  study  IMMU-132-05  were  not  provided  because  the 
applicant is still in the process of developing and validating ADA assays for SG. Bioanalytical study reports 
for antidrug-antibody (ADA) and neutralizing antibody (NAb) determination for both Studies IMMU-132-01 
and  IMMU-132-05,  the  NAb  assay  method  validation  report  as  well  as  an  integrated  summary  of 
immunogenicity will be provided as a post-authorisation measure by Q3 2022.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Study IMMU-132-05 demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in 
progression free and overall survival for sacituzumab govitecan (SG) compared to treatment of physician´s 
choice in a heavily pretreated metastatic TNBC population.  
The treatment effect of SG for patients with previously treated, stable brain metastasis appears similar to 
that of TPC; taking the benefit of SG in distant metastases into account, SG is considered a treatment option 
also for patients with stable brain metastases.  
The safety profile of SG is considered rather unfavourable compared to the chemotherapeutic agents of the 
control arm, mainly due to high rates of haematological events (severe neutropenia) and gastrointestinal 
disorders (severe diarrhoea); nonetheless, toxicities can be regarded as manageable by support with GCS-
factor and dose modifications. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Given the significant improvement in overall survival, the benefit of a treatment with SG outweighs the 
increased toxicities compared to standard chemotherapy options. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Conclusions on the clinical relevance of different levels of tumor Trop-2 expression for the treatment with SG 
are hampered by the retrospective character of the analyses and the limited size of the Trop-2–evaluable 
population (data available for only 60% of study population with even smaller numbers for patients with low 
Assessment report

tumor Trop-2 expression status). However, available data suggest that even though the treatment effect of 
SG was smaller in subgroups with low Trop-2 expression relative to participants with high Trop-2 expression, 
efficacy of SG appeared superior compared to the control arm also for patients with low Trop-2 expression. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Trodelvy is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Trodelvy is favourable in the following indication: 
Trodelvy as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic 
triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) who have received two or more prior systemic therapies, including at 
least one of them for advanced disease (see section 5.1). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product within 
6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP 
Assessment report  
EMA/623887/2021 
Page 158/159 
 
 
 
 
presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that sacituzumab govitecan is a new 
active substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European 
Union.

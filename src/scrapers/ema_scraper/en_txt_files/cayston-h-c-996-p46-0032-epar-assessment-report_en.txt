1.  INTRODUCTION 
On 28 May 2013, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Cayston 75 mg in accordance 
with article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006.  
2.  SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The commercially available formulation of Cayston was used in the study. 
2.2.  Clinical aspects 
Study EA-US-205-0122 was an expanded access program conducted in Canada. The primary objective 
of this program was to provide expanded access to Cayston to Canadian patients with cystic fibrosis 
(CF) and chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) infection who had limited treatment options and were 
at risk for disease progression. Although Study EA-US-205-0122 was not part of the agreed Cayston 
Paediatric Investigation Plan (EMEA-000827-PIP01-09-M01), it did include three paediatric patients.  
The MAH did not propose any SmPC changes. 
Description 
Study EA-US-205-0122 was an expanded access program conducted in Canada. This was an open-
label program with no formal hypothesis testing planned. Only safety data were collected.  
Methods 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was as follows: To provide expanded access to CAYSTON to 
Canadian patients with CF and chronic PA infection who have limited treatment options and are at risk 
for disease progression prior to commercial availability and establishment of reimbursement programs 
through Provincial Ministries of Health. 
Study design 
This was an open-label, expanded access program of Cayston for patients with CF and PA airway 
infection who had limited treatment options and were at high risk for disease progression. Subjects 
who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria were enrolled in the study and received Cayston 75 mg TID in 
56-day cycles of therapy (28 days on Cayston followed by 28 days off) until 1 of the following events 
occurred: voluntary withdrawal from study, the investigator requested withdrawal for subject benefit, 
death, New Drug Submission approval by Health Canada and reimbursement programs were available 
through Provincial Ministries of Health, or until study termination by Gilead. 
Study population /Sample size 
Forty-five patients - who had forced expiratory volume in 1 second predicted (FEV1 %) being <50%,  
aged ≥6 years with CF and chronic PA infection who were at high risk for disease progression were 
included in the expanded program (table 1). This program included four adults patients from the open 
label study CP-AI-006. The other 41 patients were not enrolled in any Cayston trial before.

Table 1. Overview of Study EA-US-205-0122 
Treatment 
Patients who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria could receive Cayston 75 mg 3 times daily in 56-day 
cycles of therapy (28 days on Cayston followed by 28 days off) until 1 of the following events occurred: 
voluntary withdrawal from study, the investigator requested withdrawal for patient benefit, death, new 
drug submission approval by Health Canada and reimbursement programs were available through 
Provincial Ministries of Health, or the study was terminated the MAH. 
2.3 Results 
Only three paediatric patients (one patient aged 13 years (F, Asian) and two patients aged 17 years 
(M,F, Caucasian)), receiving at least 1 dose of Cayston, were enrolled of which two completed the 
program. The remaining 42 patients in the study were between the ages of 18 and 65 years. Overall, 
thirty-four patients (75.6%) completed the study. 
Of the 3 paediatric patients one patient - eligible for lung transplant - had a FEV1 % predicted of 28%. 
The two other patients had a FEV1 % predicted of 110% and 47% respectively. All three patients were 
treatment compliant. 
Overall thirteen patients who were eligible for lung transplant had a mean (SD) FEV1 % predicted at 
baseline of 30.69%, with all but one of the patients having baseline FEV1 ≤50% predicted: 11 patients 
with a baseline FEV1 ≤40% predicted and 1 patient with baseline FEV1 >40% and ≤50% predicted.  
For those patients who were not eligible for lung transplant, the mean (SD) FEV1 % predicted at 
baseline was 46.22%, with the majority of patients having baseline FEV1 ≤50% predicted: 13 patients 
with baseline FEV1 ≤40% predicted and 10 patients with baseline FEV1 >40% and ≤50% predicted. 
Efficacy results 
Not applicable as no efficacy data was collected. 
Safety results  
Of the 3 paediatric patients enrolled in the study, two experienced SAEs. One patient, age 17 years (F) 
at study entry, experienced 3 episodes of cystic fibrosis exacerbation and 1 patient, age 13 years (F) 
at study entry, experienced 5 episodes of lung disorder (including 4 episodes of pulmonary 
exacerbation and 1 episode of end-stage lung disease resulting in death). All reported adverse events 
were already listed in the SmPC. The third paediatric patient (17 years, M) did not experience SAE. 
In the overall population treatment-emergent serious adverse events (SAEs) were experienced by 25 
patients (55.6%). Percentages of patients experiencing SAEs overall and those experiencing 
respiratory SAEs were similar during each treatment cycle but varied over time. The variability seen at 
different treatment cycles may be due to the small number of patients enrolled in this study and the 
reduced patient numbers at each successive cycle.  
Two adult patients experienced SAEs assessed as Cayston related (one patient experienced chest 
discomfort and dizziness, and one patient experienced chest discomfort). The patients experienced the 
adverse event during treatment cycle 1 and discontinued treatment. The patient experiencing dizziness 
improved without treatment over 1 hour. The event was considered drug related by the investigator.

As dizziness is a newly observed adverse event it needs to be closely monitored in future periodic 
safety update reports (PSURs). 
Haemoptysis has not been reported within this study. 
In the adult population one additional patient died, five patients discontinued Cayston due to SAEs and 
six patients interrupted Cayston due to SAEs.  For overview refer to table 2. Overall the reported 
events are already listed in the SmPC. 
Table 2: EA-US-205-0122: Frequent Treatment-Emergent SAEs and the Duration-Adjusted Rates 
Reported for ≥ 2 Patients (Safety Analysis Set, n = 45). 
3. OVERALL CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION 
In conclusion the safety data resulting from this study do not warrant any SmPC changes at this 
moment, all reported side effects are already listed in the SmPC except for the adverse event 
“dizziness”. The Rapporteur is of the opinion that “dizziness” should be closely monitored in future 
PSURs. The article 46 paediatric submission is considered fulfilled. 
The benefit/risk for the current approved indication remains positive.

“An in vitro dissolution study was conducted to evaluate the 
impact of alcohol (5, 10, 20, and 40 %) on the dissolution 
of Noxafil gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral

Noxafil gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral

interfere with its delayed release characteristics.”

PBPK modelling approach paper) and post-marketing safety 
data support this update of the product Information for 
Noxafil (posaconazole). 
Data from the clinical study show that concomitant use of 
posaconazole 300 mg, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, with 
repeated doses of venetoclax 50 mg and 100 mg (an 
antineoplastic agent), which is also mainly metabolised by 
CYP3A4, resulted in much higher venetoclax maximum 
concentrations and exposures compared with venetoclax 
400 mg administered alone. Safety data from post-
marketing experience identified seven serious cases of 
drug-drug interactions between posaconazole and 
venetoclax. All cases were considered serious and 
described a potential drug-drug interaction between 
posaconazole and venetoclax since the drugs were used 
concomitantly and the serious adverse events (TLS and 
neutropenia) reported were those that could be expected 
with venetoclax. 
The posaconazole - venetoclax contraindication during 
initiation and dose-titration phase in patients with chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) was added to section 4.3 of the

The MAH evaluated post-marketing reports in the scientific

literature of concurrent hypertension and hypokalemia that 
marketing experience, following a review of six case 
reports in the scientific literature of concurrent

In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder 
(MAH) took the opportunity to update the list of local 
had the clinical features of pseudoaldosteronism or 
mineralocorticoid excess. The analysis of posaconazole-
induced hypertension and hypokalaemia due to inhibition of 
the 11β-hydroxylase enzyme supports the causal 
association between posaconazole and 
pseudoaldosteronism. Inclusion of 'pseudoaldosteronism' as 
an adverse event to the SmPC and PL was accepted.

Labelling and 
administration of azole antifungals, including posaconazole, 
data 
PL 
with vincristine has been associated with neurotoxicity and 
other serious adverse reactions, including seizures, 
peripheral neuropathy, syndrome of inappropriate 
antidiuretic hormone secretion, and paralytic ileus. Reserve 
azole antifungals, including posaconazole, for patients 
receiving a vinca alkaloid, including vincristine, who have 
no alternative antifungal treatment options. 
The corresponding information on vincristine toxicity in 
section 4.5 was also updated to reinforce the warning 
message. Most of the vinca alkaloids (e.g., vincristine and 
vinblastine) are substrates of CYP3A4. Concomitant 
administration of azole antifungals, including posaconazole, 
with vincristine has been associated with serious adverse 
reactions (see section 4.4). Posaconazole may increase the 
plasma concentrations of vinca alkaloids which may lead to 
neurotoxicity and other serious adverse reactions. 
Therefore, reserve azole antifungals, including 
posaconazole, for patients receiving a vinca alkaloid, 
including vincristine, who have no alternative antifungal 
treatment options.

however raised several methodological and technical 
concerns regarding the appropriateness of those

the MAH and the EUCAST, the MAH provided the CHMP with 
responses to the outstanding issue of Aspergillus 
breakpoints explaining why it does not consider that it is 
able as yet to include these in the product information for 
Noxafil and requesting a further extension of the deadline 
for this. Considering the MAH’s concerns and since the 
breakpoint information does not constitute part of the 
safety specification, the CHMP agreed to delay the inclusion 
of the breakpoints for A. fumigatus and A. terreus in the 
SmPC until further clinical data is available. Meanwhile, as 
recommended in situations where there is insufficient data 
to support breakpoints, the Noxafil SmPC section 5.1 was 
updated with inclusion of the Aspergillus epidemiological 
cut off values. This update does not affect the benefit/risk 
balance of Noxafil.

concurrently. The clinical need for patients to take both 
drugs concurrently may occur when a patient with 
underlying HIV infection experiences an episode of 
oropharyngeal candidiasis that may be refractory to other 
antifungal therapy. The results of the study indicate that 
the drug combination of fosamprenavir and posaconazole 
has the potential to reduce posaconazole exposure and 
therefore close monitoring for breakthrough fungal 
infections is recommended.

As part of PSUR 5, the MAH presented a cumulative review 
PL with the ADR "confusional state". An introductory 
warning on possible serious ADRs is included in 
section 4 of the PL. Both these changes are further 
to the evaluation of PSUR 5 (covering the period 
from 26.10.07 to 25.10.08). The MAH took this 
opportunity to update information on local 
on cases of "confusional state". Further to the evaluation of 
the cases reported, the CHMP concluded that a casual 
relation with posaconazol could not be excluded and 
therefore requested to include the ADR "confusional state" 
in the product information. 
During the assessment of this type  II variation II/17, it

was noticed that introductory statements and a list of 
symptoms for which immediate consultation of a physician 
was needed in the PL. 
Some amendments were requested by the CHMP on the 
basis that patients are not always aware which symptoms 
may be a sign of a serious adverse reaction which needs 
immediate medical advice. Additionally, the patient should 
be made aware that also some of the other adverse 
reactions/symptoms may get severe and requires 
consultation of a doctor or pharmacist. Consequently the PL 
has been updated to clarify the different types of adverse 
reactions that the patient knows how to react.

008, the Marketing Authorisation Holder conducted studies 
on the effect of hepatic inpairment and different 
gastrointestinal conditions on posaconazole blood levels. 
The findings and consequent recommendations for use of 
posaconale were added to the Product Information as 
follows. Information regarding careful dosing in patients 
with hepatic impairment was introduced to sections 4.2, 
4.4 and 5.2 of the Summary of Product Characteristics 
(SPC). Information on concomitant use of H2 receptor 
antagonists and PPIs, which should be avoided, was 
introduced to section 4.5 of the SPC. The positive effect on 
bioavailability of a split dose of 4 single doses instead of 2 
when taken in a fasted state was reflected in section 5.2, 
and a consequent recommendation of this dosing scheme 
for patients with invasive fungal infections was added to 
section 4.2 of the SPC in order to assure optimal efficacy. 
Section 3 of the Package Leaflet (PL) was updated 
accordingly. The positive effect on bioavailability of intake

together with a meal, especially when administering 
posaconazole with or directly afterwards the meal, was 
reflected in section 5.2 of the SPC, and a consequent 
recommendation to take the drug together or directly after 
food was included in section 4.2 of the SPC and sections 2

Authorisation Holder committed to submit a variation to 
bring section 4.8 of the SPC in line with the correct EU SPC 
guidance. Based on data from clinical trials and post 
marketing surveillance setting, section 4.8 was thus 
updated in accordance with MedDRA terminology. A single 
table for all adverse events regardless of source and 
appropriate cross reference to the warnings section was 
included. In addition "Sudden behaviour changes, problems 
with thinking or speech" was added to section 4 of the PL 
to reflect the psychiatric disorders events listed in section

In the framework of the Periodic Safety Update Report 
updated wording regarding hepatic events following 
CHMP assessment of PSUR 3 (covering the period

accordingly. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and

(PSUR) 3, a cumulative review of hepatic events was 
presented by the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH). 
This cumulative review included only serious events and 
selected 17 cases of 'severe' liver injury out of a total 112 
cases for detailed review. Of these, 11 cases had a fatal 
outcome with 2 outcomes unknown.  
Further to the assessment of this cumulative review, the 
CHMP concluded that it could not be excluded that 
posaconazole was the main contributor to the serious 
hepatic events and fatal outcome in many cases and the 
potentially fatal outcome of such events is not currently 
reflected in the SPC. Additionally, it was noted that the SPC 
already carries a warning in section 4.4 concerning serious 
hepatic events and lists several hepatic events in section 
4.8. However, on the basis of the high case fatality rate 
associated with serious hepatic events, the CHMP 
concluded that the SPC should be further amended in 
sections 4.4 and 4.8 in relation to fatal outcomes and that 
section 4 of the PL has been amended to reflect the new 
SPC wording.

volunteers. The MAH took the opportunity to update 
the PL with the contact details of the local 
representatives in Italy, Latvia, Norway and The 
Netherlands. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
- Co-administered with sirolimus, posaconazole had a 
marked effect on plasma levels of sirolimus, 
- Co-administered with atazanavir, posaconazole had a 
marked effect on unboosted atazanavir and on ritonavir-
boosted atazanavir plasma levels.  Furthermore, atazanavir 
being usually administered with ritonavir in the European 
Union, posaconazole has a marked effect on ritonavir-
boosted atazanavir plasma levels.  
- Co-administration of oral efavirenz and posaconazole 
resulted in clinically relevant decreases in posaconazole 
Cmax and AUC. 
The Product Information has been updated to reflect that 
blood levels of posaconazole can be decreased by efavirenz 
and that posaconazole can increase blood levels of 
sirolimus, atazanavir and midazolam.

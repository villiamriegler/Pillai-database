1.  Introduction 
On 19/10/2018, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for LONQUEX (lipegfilgrastim), in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended. A short critical expert 
overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH submits an Open Label, Randomized, Active Controlled, Multicentre Study to Evaluate the 
Efficacy, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of 
Lipegfilgrastim 100 μg/kg Body Weight in Comparison to Filgrastim 5 μg/kg Body Weight in Paediatric 
Patients Diagnosed with Ewing Family of Tumours or Rhabdomyosarcoma Receiving Chemotherapy 
Efficacy and Safety (Phase 2) Study XM22-08.  
LONQUEX (lipegfilgrastim) has been developed for the prevention and management of chemotherapy-
induced neutropenia. Belonging to the class of recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating 
factors (G-CSFs), lipegfilgrastim is structurally comparable with pegfilgrastim, the long-acting 
recombinant N-methionyl human G-CSF derivative, and the active ingredient in NEULASTA®2 
(Amgen).  
Lipegfilgrastim was approved for use in adults by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2013. 
Children were excluded from the adult lipegfilgrastim efficacy studies. However, the Applicant agreed a 
paediatric investigation plan (PIP) in 2011. Subsequent modifications to the PIP have been made and 
the latest version of the PIP was agreed in September 2017 (EMEA-001019-PIP01-10-M04). This 
program includes 2 studies in paediatric cancer patients aged 2 to <18 years with chemotherapy-
induced neutropenia. The primary objective of the Phase 1 Study XM22-07 was to investigate the 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of lipegfilgrastim, with assessment of pharmacodynamics, efficacy, safety, 
tolerability, and immunogenicity as secondary objectives. The primary objective of the PIP Phase 3 
Study (XM22-08) was to investigate the efficacy of multiple doses of lipegfilgrastim (administered once 
per cycle) compared with filgrastim (administered several times per cycle); secondary objectives were 
to assess pharmacodynamics, PK, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity. As an additional PIP 
measure, efficacy results of these 2 paediatric studies will be extrapolated to the paediatric population 
less than 2 years of age. To facilitate the lipegfilgrastim paediatric studies, glass vials containing a 10 
mg/mL lipegfilgrastim solution for subcutaneous (sc) injection were developed. 
Rapporteurs comments: 
The MAH describes the last of 2 clinical studies which form part of a paediatric investigation plan for 
lipegfilgrastim (EMEA-001019-PIP01-10-M04). In the PIP, the development of a single vial containing 6 
mg of lipegfilgrastim in a 10mg/ml solution was requested. The previous clinical study XM22-07 has 
been submitted as part of an Article 46 procedure (EMA/H/C/002556/P46). The conclusion of that 
procedure in 2015 was that a Type IB variation amend the product information to include the study 
results in sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC. The vial, used in both clinical studies (XM22-07 
and XM22-08), was a 1ml of 10mg/ml solution. Results from study XM22-07 led to an update to the 
SmPC for Lonquex, an adult pre-filled syringe containing 6 mg of lipegfilgrastim in 0.6 ml solution.   
In this current study, XM22-08, dosing was 100 μg/kg Body Weight to a maximum single dose of 6mg. 
Children weighing 60kg and above, would have received a dose of 6mg, which is the adult fixed dose 
that could be delivered with the pre-filled syringe of Lonquex.   
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
LONQUEX®2 (lipegfilgrastim) is a glyco-polyethylene glycol (PEG)ylated formulation of a recombinant 
N-methionyl human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (r-metHuG-CSF) that has been developed 
for the prevention of CTX-induced neutropenia. In Study XM22-08, lipegfilgrastim was supplied in glass 
vials containing 1 mL sterile, clear, colourless to pale yellow, preservative-free solution for sc injection 
consisting of lipegfilgrastim at a concentration of 10 mg/mL as well as excipients (acidic sodium 
acetate buffer, sorbitol [E420], polysorbate 20, and water for injection), especially developed for the

lipegfilgrastim paediatric studies. The maximum dose was to be 6 mg, as this is the fixed dose for 
adults. Injection of lipegfilgrastim was to be made using a fine graded syringe (grading mark 0.01 mL). 
After the syringe was filled with lipegfilgrastim, the needle was to be changed. Injection was to be 
made with a new 27G x½-inch injection needle. The abdomen was the preferred location for injection.

[Efficacy and Safety (Phase 2)].  
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study XM22-08 
Description 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
Primary Objective: Assess the efficacy of a single sc dose of 100 μg/kg body weight (BW) of 
lipegfilgrastim per cycle compared to daily sc doses of 5 μg/kg BW of filgrastim in children receiving 
CTX. 
Secondary Objective: Assess pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and 
immunogenicity of a single sc dose of 100 μg/kg BW of lipegfilgrastim per cycle compared to daily 5 
μg/kg BW of filgrastim doses. 
Study design 
A Phase 2, multicenter, open-label, randomized, active-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, PK, 
pharmacodynamics, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of lipegfilgrastim at a dose of 100 μg/kg 
body weight (BW) in comparison with filgrastim at daily doses of 5 μg/kg BW in paediatric patients 
diagnosed with the Ewing family of tumours or rhabdomyosarcoma receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy 
(CTX).  
Study population /Sample size 
Three groups of patients stratified by age (2 to <6 years, 6 to <12 years, and 12 to <18 years) were 
enrolled. Recruitment of the youngest age group began only after results of the absolute neutrophil 
count (ANC) and safety data of 3 patients from the middle age group, who had completed the 
treatment phase with lipegfilgrastim, had been reviewed by the Data Monitoring Committee and no 
significant safety signals for lipegfilgrastim that could prevent recruitment in the youngest age stratum 
had been detected.

Table 1: Composition of the study population 
Treatments 
Screening period of up to 2 weeks with a treatment period for a maximum of 18 weeks which consisted 
of 4 cycles of CTX of 21 days each with an allowance of 14-day delay between each CTX cycle; and a 
follow-up period of up to 365 days from first investigational medicinal product (IMP) administration. An 
end of study (EOS)/or early termination (ET) visit was performed 4 weeks after the start of the last 
CTX [±3 days]). Follow-up visits were performed on days 180 (±2 weeks) and 365 (±2 weeks) after 
the first IMP administration. In each of the treatment cycles of CTX, lipegfilgrastim or filgrastim were 
administered sc on day 1 of a cycle approximately 24 hours (+6 hours) after the end of the last CTX 
administration in week 1 of the specific regimen. The corresponding study day 1 in different CTX 
regimens were as shown below: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
ifosfamide plus vincristine plus actinomycin D (IVA): CTX-day 2+1 
vincristine plus actinomycin D plus cyclophosphamide (VAC): CTX-day 1+1, CTX-day 2+1, 
CTX-day 3+1, or CTX-day 5+1 (depending on the actinomycin schedule and the number of 
days cyclophosphamide was given) 
ifosfamide plus vincristine plus actinomycin D plus doxorubicin (IVADo): CTX-day 2+1 
vincristine plus doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide alternating with ifosfamide plus etoposide 
(VDC/IE): CTX-day 2+1 during cycles 1 and 3, and CTX-day 5+1 during cycles 2 and 4

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Efficacy Measure(s) and Endpoint(s): Duration of severe neutropenia (DSN) in cycle 1, 
defined as the number of days with severe neutropenia in cycle 1 (from start of CTX until day 15). 
Severe neutropenia was defined as Grade 4 neutropenia with ANC <0.5 × 109/L. If the ANC did not 
drop below 0.5 × 109/L, the DSN was set to 0. 
Secondary Efficacy Measures and Endpoints:

•  DSN in cycles 2 to 4 per cycle. 
•  Duration of very severe neutropenia (DVSN) in cycles 1 to 4 per cycle. 
Efficacy evaluations were performed on blood samples taken for the pharmacodynamic assessments in 
combination with temperature measurements with following definition: 
•  Severe neutropenia: neutropenia with ANC <0.5 × 109/L. 
• 
• 
 Very severe neutropenia: ANC <0.1 × 109/L. 
Incidence of febrile neutropenia: body temperature >38.3°C or 2 consecutive readings higher 
than 37.8°C measured at axilla or external ear at least 2 hours apart; and ANC <0.5 × 109/L 
or expected to be <0.5 × 109/L per cycle and across all cycles. 
Secondary Pharmacodynamic Measures and Endpoints: 
•  Area under the curve of ANC (AUCANC) until day 15 in cycle 1. 
•  ANC nadir, e.g., the lowest ANC value recorded, per cycle. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Time to ANC nadir per cycle, defined as the time from start of CTX until occurrence 
of the ANC nadir in the cycle. 
Time to ANC nadir per cycle, defined as the time from first IMP administration in a cycle until 
occurrence of the ANC nadir in the cycle. 
Time to ANC recovery (ANC >1.0 × 109/L and ANC >2.0 × 109/L) from first day of CTX. 
Time to ANC recovery (ANC >1.0 × 109/L and ANC >2.0 × 109/L) from nadir per cycle. 
Safety Variables: Safety of the IMPs was evaluated based on the assessment of adverse events, 
physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical laboratory parameters, 
immunogenicity, spleen sonography, and concomitant medications. 
Tolerability Measures and Endpoints: 
• 
• 
• 
Local tolerability at the study drug injection site was assessed at 1 hour (±10 minutes) and 24 
hours (±1 hour) following lipegfilgrastim or filgrastim first administration at each cycle. (site was 
assessed for the presence and severity of pain, erythema/redness, ecchymosis, and induration). 
number (%) of patients who failed to complete the study. 
number (%) of patients who failed to complete the study due to adverse events. 
In addition, the effects of treatment on mortality due to infections and overall mortality until end of 
follow-up period were examined. First patient first visit was on 08 September 2015 and last patient last 
visit of the treatment period was 18 April 2018. A few of the patients are still in the follow-up phase of 
the study. 
Statistical Methods 
Documentation of statistical methods used in this study is provided in Statistical Analyses Plan in the 
submitted data. The sample size of 42 patients (21 patients per treatment group) has been chosen 
primarily on practical grounds and feasibility (expected low recruitment rate in the population under

investigation). According to literature data, in paediatric cancer patients receiving G-CSF treatment 
(for both short and long acting G-CSF formulations) a DSN within cycle 1 of about 6 days with a 
standard deviation of about 2.6 days can be expected. Based on this assumption for the within group 
variability, a sample size of 21 patients per treatment group is expected to allow the estimation of 
mean DSN in cycle 1 with a 95% CI having a half width of 1.11 days for each treatment group. 
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Analysis Set included all randomized patients. Treatment was assigned based 
on the treatment to which patients were randomized, regardless of which treatment they received. 
Safety Analysis Set included all randomized patients who receive at least 1 dose of IMP. Treatment 
was assigned based upon the treatment patients received, regardless of the treatment to which they 
were assigned. 
Per-Protocol (PP) Analysis Set included all patients for whom no protocol violations were reported 
that may have impacted the efficacy of the IMP. For the purpose of the exclusion of a patient data from 
PP Analysis Set the following criteria were used: 
a. violation of inclusion/exclusion criteria 
b. intake of the prohibited concomitant medications 
c. received <75% of the intended study medication dose 
d. received non-randomized study medication 
e. violation of the GCP criteria resulting in the exclusion of the patient data from the 
study 
f. no treatment with randomized study medication in cycle 1 
Active Controlled- Paediatric Chemotherapy Induced Neutropenia 
g. insufficient ANC data for efficacy evaluation, specifically, at least 5 ANC 
assessments were required between day 2 to day 15 
The above criteria only applied to CTX cycle 1 of the treatment phase. Of note, only those violations 
falling into categories “a” to “g” lead to exclusions if they influenced the interpretability of the efficacy 
study results. Determination of the exclusions from the PP Analysis Set was completed and 
documented prior to the database lock. The Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set included all patients from the 
safety population who received lipegfilgrastim in cycle 1 and had at least 1 pharmacokinetic 
assessment available for evaluation. 
Rapporteurs comments: 
As the MAH states, no formal hypothesis was tested in this study, and the study was not powered, 
therefore, the results and conclusions are limited to estimates of comparison between groups.  
5 different chemotherapy regimens were allowed in this trial, therefore, there is heterogenicity, 
however, each of these different groups of CTX regimens receive treatment with lipegfilgrastim or 
filgrastim, allowing a comparison to be made. Also 2 types of malignancy patients were recruited into 
the study i.e. Ewing’s and rhabdomyosarcoma, adding further heterogenicity to the study population.  
The MAH describes further the limitations of the study on page 29 of this report.  
Filgrastim is currently licenced in the EU in adults and children  for the reduction in the duration of 
severe neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients treated with established 
cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and 
myelodysplastic syndromes) and for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia in patients 
undergoing myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation considered to be at 
increased risk of prolonged severe neutropenia. It is, therefore, suitable as an active comparator in this 
setting.

Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Of the 45 patients screened, 43 patients at 21 centres in 10 countries met entry criteria and were 
eligible for enrolment into the study. One patient (3 years old) was enrolled but was not randomized 
because the youngest age cohort (2 to<6 years) was not started at the time of enrolment (not a 
screen failure). Of the 2 patients who were not enrolled, 1 was excluded on the basis of 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the other patient was excluded due to “other” reasons. 
42 patients with Ewing family of tumours or rhabdomyosarcoma were enrolled and randomized to 
lipegfilgrastim or filgrastim treatment groups (21 patients in the lipegfilgrastim treatment group and 
21 patients in the filgrastim treatment group).   
The highest overall rate of discontinuation from treatment was observed in the filgrastim group (4 
[19%] patients); 2 (10%) patients due to adverse events, 1 (5%) patient due to withdrawal of consent 
by oneself, and 1 (5%) patient due to withdrawal of consent by the legally acceptable representative. 
One (5%) patient from the lipegfilgrastim treatment group withdrew consent and discontinued the 
study treatment.  
Average age of the patients was 9.24 years (range 2.0 to 17.6 years). All patients were white, and 
majority were males (62%). The disposition of patients is displayed in Figure 2 and summarized in 
Table 2.

Overall, the MAH states the treatment groups were balanced across age cohorts. A higher proportion of 
patients in the 6<12 years age cohort in the lipegfilgrastim treatment group compared to filgrastim 
group (8 vs 6 patients) and a slightly lower proportion of patients in the 12 to <18 years age cohort in 
the lipegfilgrastim group compared to the filgrastim group (6 vs 8 patients). Of note, higher proportion 
of patients in the older age cohort (6to <12 years and 12 to <18 years) in each of the treatment 
groups received VIDE CTX regimen compared to patients in the youngest age cohort: 
• 
• 
Lipegfilgrastim: 1 patient in the 2 to< 6 years cohort, 5 patients in the 6to <12 years cohort 
and 3 patients in the 12 to < 18 years age cohort. 
Filgrastim: 2 Patients in the 2 to 6 years cohort, 3 patients in the 6 to<12 years cohort an d5 
patients in the 12 to <18 years cohort.

cohorts (All patients)  
A higher proportion of patients in the older cohorts (6 to <18 years) in each of the treatment groups 
received VIDE CTX regimen compared to patients in the youngest age group (Table 3). 
Exclusions from Analyses Sets 
All 42 patients randomized received at least 1 dose of either lipegfilgrastim or filgrastim and were 
included in the ITT Analysis Set. Of the 21 (100%) patients who received lipegfilgrastim, 20 (95%)

patients were included in the PP Analysis Set and 1 (5%) patient in the 2 to <6 years age cohort who 
received IVADo CTX in cycle 1 was excluded due to violation of inclusion/exclusion criteria. Of the 21 
(100%) patients who received filgrastim, 19 (90%) patients were included in the PP Analysis Set; 2 
(10%) patients, 1 each in the 6 to <12 years and 12 to <18 years age cohorts received <75% of the 
intended study medication and were excluded from the PP Analysis Set .Both the patients who were 
excluded from the PP Analysis Set received VIDE CTX in cycle 1  
Baseline data 
Overall, the MAH states that lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim treatment groups were well balanced with 
respect to age (mean: 9.11 and 9.37 years, respectively), sex (67% and 57% male, respectively), and 
race (all patients were white) (Tables 4, 5).

Baseline characteristics with respect to weight, height, and body mass index were similar for 
the patients in each treatment group and across age cohorts for lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim 
treatment groups as stated by the MAH. 
Baseline Cancer-Related Characteristics 
Treatment groups were well balanced according to the baseline disease characteristics. Of the 42 
patients enrolled, 20 (48%) patients had rhabdomyosarcoma (9/21 patients in lipegfilgrastim group 
and 11/21 patients in the filgrastim group) and 22 (52%) patients had Ewing family of tumours (12/21 
patients in the lipegfilgrastim group and 10/21 patients in the filgrastim group). Of the 20 patients with 
rhabdomyosarcoma, 4/9 in the lipegfilgrastim group and 6/11 patients in the filgrastim group had an 
advanced stage of the disease (≥stage III) at study entry. Of the 22 patients with Ewing family of 
tumours, 8/12 in the lipegfilgrastim group and 4/10 patients in the filgrastim group had an advanced 
stage of the disease (≥stage III) at study entry (Table 15). The majority of the patients enrolled in the 
study did not have metastasis of their cancers (14 [67%] patients in the lipegfilgrastim group and 17 
[81%] patients in the filgrastim group). The corresponding age cohorts across the treatment groups 
were also well balanced according to the baseline disease characteristics including type of cancer, and 
severity of the disease. Of note, in both treatment groups, the proportion of patients with Ewing family 
of tumours was slightly higher in older age cohorts (6 to <12 years and 12 to <18 years) and the 
proportion of patients with rhabdomyosarcoma was slightly higher in the youngest age cohort.

Cancer History 
Overall, the mean time since cancer diagnosis was approximately 2 months. The majority of patients 
underwent surgery as prior anti-cancer therapy (20 [95%] patients in the lipegfilgrastim group and 18 
[86%] patients in the filgrastim group). A small number of patients received CTX as prior anti-cancer 
therapy (9/21 patients in the lipegfilgrastim group and 7/21 patients in the filgrastim group). One 
(5%) patient in the lipegfilgrastim group and 3 (14%) patients in the filgrastim group underwent 
radiotherapy as prior anti-cancer therapy. 
Medical History 
Abnormalities in medical history were as expected for cancer patients. Overall, there were 16 (76%) 
patients in the lipegfilgrastim group and 13 (62%) patients in the filgrastim group with at least 1 
abnormal finding. The most common abnormal findings in the medical history included blood and 
lymphatic system disorders (4 [19%] patients in the lipegfilgrastim group and 5 [24%] patients in the 
filgrastim group), infections and infestations (5 [24%] patients in the lipegfilgrastim group and 3 
[14%] patients in the filgrastim group), and musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (2 [10%] 
patients in the lipegfilgrastim group and 4 [19%] patients in the filgrastim group). 
Prior and Concomitant Therapy Both treatment groups were generally comparable in their use of 
prior medications. All patients received at least 1 medication prior to study enrolment. In general, the 
medications taken were consistent with the patients’ known medical histories. 
Efficacy results 
No formal hypothesis testing was performed as the study was not powered for it; conclusions were 
limited to providing estimates of the means of treatments and their differences 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint Results  
The primary efficacy endpoint was the DSN in cycle 1. The MAH states that there was no meaningful 
difference in the DSN in cycle 1 between the lipegfilgrastim (mean ±standard deviation [SD]: 2.7 
±2.25 days) and filgrastim (mean ±SD: 2.5 ±2.09 days) groups in the Per-Protocol (PP) Analysis Set. 
Results in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Analysis Set were consistent with the PP Analysis Set. A Poisson 
regression analysis with factors of treatment and age cohort, and baseline (before IMP administration) 
ANC value as covariate, was fitted. In the PP Analysis Set the least squares mean difference 
(lipegfilgrastim minus filgrastim) was 1.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: –0.21, 2.26; P = 0.102) and 
in the ITT Analysis Set the difference was 0.4 (95% CI: –0.92, 1.72; P = 0.543).  
There were no notable differences in the DSN in cycle 1 across the corresponding age cohorts between 
the treatment groups (PP and ITT Analysis Sets).  
The DSN for cycle 1, by treatment group, and CTX administered in cycle 1 in the PP and ITT Analysis 
Sets are provided in below (Table 6):

Table 7: Duration of Severe Neutropenia (Days) for CTX Cycle 1 by treatment group and CTX 
administered in cycle 1 (ITT and PP Analysis Set) 
In both treatment groups, the mean (SD) DSN in patients who received a doxorubicin-based CTX 
regimen VDC/IE and VIDE in cycle 1 was longer compared with patients who received other CTX 
regimens (IVA and VAC). Of the 2 most frequent CTX regimens used in the study (IVA and VIDE), the 
mean (SD) DSN was shorter for patients who received IVA compared to VIDE (PP Analysis Set; 
lipegfilgrastim: 0.4 [0.53] days vs 4.1 [1.54] days; filgrastim: 0.4 [0.79] days vs 3.9 [1.13] days) 
(Table 7). 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint Results 
Incidence of Severe Neutropenia in Each Cycle (Cycles 1 to 4) 
The overall incidence of severe neutropenia in the lipegfilgrastim treatment group was similar 
compared to the filgrastim treatment group (85% and 84%; PP Analysis Set). There was no 
meaningful difference in the likelihood of experiencing severe neutropenia in cycles 1 to 4 in the 
lipegfilgrastim treatment group compared to the filgrastim treatment group (stratified Cochran-Mantel-
Haenszel [CMH] odds ratio [OR] = 1.19; 95% CI: 0.220, 6.423). There were no meaningful differences 
in any of the age cohorts in the lipegfilgrastim treatment group in the overall likelihood of experiencing 
severe neutropenia as compared to the corresponding age cohorts in the filgrastim treatment group. 
Limited inference can be made due to the small number of patients in each age cohort. Also, there 
were no notable differences observed in the overall incidence of severe neutropenia between the 
lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim treatment groups when the results were stratified by the CTX regimen 
received in cycle 1. Of note, all 17 patients in both treatment groups who received VIDE CTX in cycle 1 
experienced severe neutropenia, whereas approximately 50% of patients who received IVA CTX in 
cycle 1 experienced severe neutropenia (PP Analysis Set).

Incidence of Febrile Neutropenia per Cycle and Across all Cycles 
The overall incidence of febrile neutropenia in the lipegfilgrastim group was slightly lower compared to 
the filgrastim group (35% vs 42%; PP Analysis Set). There were no meaningful differences in the 
likelihood of experiencing febrile neutropenia in cycles 1 to 4 in the lipegfilgrastim treatment group as 
compared to the filgrastim treatment group (stratified CMH OR = 0.67; 95% CI: 0.171, 2.600). There 
were no meaningful differences in any of the age cohorts of the lipegfilgrastim treatment group in the 
overall likelihood of experiencing febrile neutropenia as compared to the corresponding age cohorts in 
the filgrastim treatment group. Due to small numbers, little can be said regarding age cohort 
differences. ORs (95% CI) of lipegfilgrastim to filgrastim for the overall incidence of febrile neutropenia 
by age group are provided below (PP Analysis Set). 
•  2 to <6 years: 0.20 (0.011, 3.235) 
•  6 to <12 years: 1.50 (0.099, 27.079) 
•  12 to <18 years: 1.20 (0.013, 109.698) 
Incidence of Febrile Neutropenia and Use of Systemic Antibiotics 5/15 (33%) of patients in the 
lipegfilgrastim group and 7/12 (58%) patients in the filgrastim group that received prophylactic 
systemic antibiotics experienced febrile neutropenia; and 2/5 (40%) of patients in the lipegfilgrastim 
group and 1/7 (14%) patients in the filgrastim group that did not receive prophylactic systemic 
antibiotics experienced febrile neutropenia. There was no notable difference in the lipegfilgrastim 
treatment group as compared to the filgrastim treatment group in the overall likelihood of experiencing 
febrile neutropenia in patients who received concomitant prophylactic systemic antibiotics (OR = 0.36; 
95% CI: 0.056, 2.192; PP Analysis Set) or in patients who did not receive concomitant prophylactic 
systemic antibiotics (OR = 4.00; 95% CI: 0.133, 274.494; PP Analysis Set). 
Incidence and Duration of Hospitalization Due to Febrile Neutropenia There was no difference 
in the incidence of hospitalization due to febrile neutropenia in cycle 1 between the treatment groups 
(1 [5%] patient in 12 to <18 years age cohort under each treatment group; PP Analysis Set). The 
duration of hospitalization due to febrile neutropenia was 7 days for the lipegfilgrastim patient and 8 
days for the filgrastim patient. In each cycle of cycles 2 to 4, there was 1 patient hospitalized in the 
lipegfilgrastim treatment group for a duration ranging from 6 to 10 days. All hospitalizations in 
lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim treatment groups occurred in the 12 to <18 years age cohorts and in 
patients who received VIDE CTX in cycle 1. 
Duration of Severe Neutropenia in Cycles 2 to 4 per Cycle There was no meaningful difference in 
the mean (SD) DSN in cycles 2 to 4 between the lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim groups (PP Analysis 
Set).

• 
cycle 2: 2.1 (1.88) days versus 2.5 (2.60) days 
cycle 3: 2.2 (2.23) days versus 2.2 (2.38) days 
cycle 4: 2.1 (2.38) days versus 2.0 (1.90) days 
Also, when the results were stratified according to the age cohorts, no meaningful differences were 
observed between the 2 treatment groups in the mean DSN in cycles 2 to 4. Limited inference can be 
made due to the small number of patients in each age cohort. Comparing the 2 most frequent CTX 
used in the study (IVA and VIDE), in cycles 2 to 4, the mean (SD) DSN was shorter for patients who 
received IVA compared to VIDE (range: 0 to 0.6 days vs 2.8 to 3.9 days). 
Incidence of Very Severe Neutropenia in Each Cycle (Cycles 1 to 4) The overall incidence of 
very severe neutropenia was similar between the lipegfilgrastim group and the filgrastim group (70% 
vs 68%; PP Analysis Set). There was no meaningful difference in the likelihood of experiencing very 
severe neutropenia in cycles 1 to 4 in the lipegfilgrastim treatment group as compared to the filgrastim 
treatment group (stratified CMH OR = 1.08; 95% CI: 0.276, 4.197; PP Analysis Set). There were no 
meaningful differences in any of the age cohorts in the lipegfilgrastim treatment group in the overall 
likelihood of experiencing very severe neutropenia as compared to the corresponding age cohorts in 
the filgrastim treatment group. ORs (95% CI) of lipegfilgrastim to filgrastim for the overall incidence of 
very severe neutropenia by age group are provided below (PP Analysis Set). 
•  2 to <6 years: 0.80 (0.040, 16.227) 
•  6 to <12 years: 2.00 (0.092, 39.989) 
•  12 to <18 years: 0.80 (0.040, 16.227)

According to the CTX regimen received in cycle 1, there were no meaningful differences observed in 
the overall incidence of very severe neutropenia between the lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim treatment 
groups. 
Duration of Very Severe Neutropenia in Cycles 1 to 4 per Cycle There were no meaningful 
differences in the DVSN in cycles 1 to 4 between the 2 treatment groups. Mean (SD) DVSN by CTX 
cycle is provided below (lipegfilgrastim vs filgrastim; PP Analysis Set).

cycle 4: 1.1 (1.56) days versus 0.8 (0.93) days 
Similar values for DVSN were seen when the results were stratified by age cohorts. There were no 
meaningful differences in the DVSN in cycles 1 to 4 between the corresponding age cohorts across the 
treatment groups. Limited inference can be made due to the small number of patients in each age 
cohort. 
Pharmacodynamics Results 
Area Under the Curve of Absolute Neutrophil Count Until Day 15 in Cycle 1 
The geometric mean AUCANC until day 15 in the lipegfilgrastim group was higher compared to filgrastim 
group (104.9473 × 109/L*days vs 84.2795 × 109/L*days; PP Analysis Set). An analysis of covariance 
model was fitted to evaluate the difference between the treatment groups on the AUCANC controlling for 
either age or the CTX regimen administered in cycle 1. The geometric mean ratio (95% CI for 
geometric mean ratio) of AUCANC was 1.2859 (0.90873, 1.81973) for the model with age cohort as a 
covariate and 1.3377 (0.95048, 1.88275) with CTX regimen administered in cycle 1 as a covariate. 
Results in the ITT Analysis Set were supportive of the results in the PP Analysis Set. When the results 
were stratified by age cohorts and the CTX regimen administered in cycle 1, there were no meaningful 
differences in the mean AUCANC values between the lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim treatment groups in 
the corresponding age cohorts within the lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim treatment groups. 
Mean Absolute Neutrophil Count Values by Cycle and Treatment Group:  
For both the treatment groups, the highest mean ANC values were observed on day 2 and the lowest 
mean ANC values were observed between days 6 and 7 of cycle 1. In the filgrastim group, the mean 
ANC values recovered approximately to the baseline values around day 15 of cycle 1. However, in the 
lipegfilgrastim group, the mean ANC values remained slightly higher than the baseline values on day 
15 of cycle 1. During cycles 2 and 3, the mean ANC values were higher in the lipegfilgrastim group 
compared to the filgrastim group. In both the treatment groups, the highest mean ANC values were 
observed on day 2 of cycles 2 and 3; and the lowest mean ANC values were observed between days 6 
and 8 of cycles 2 and 3. In both treatment groups, the mean ANC values remained slightly higher than 
the baseline values on day 15 of cycle 2 (Figure 5). On day 15 of cycle 3, the mean ANC values in the 
filgrastim group recovered to the baseline values, whereas they remained slightly higher than the 
baseline values in the lipegfilgrastim group. During cycle 4, the mean ANC values were slightly higher 
in the lipegfilgrastim group until day 5 compared to the filgrastim group. In both the treatment groups, 
the highest mean ANC values were observed on day 2 and the lowest mean ANC values were observed 
between days 6 and 8. Of note, there was a steep decrease in the ANC value on day 11 for 
lipegfilgrastim group. On day 15 of cycle 4, the mean ANC values were similar between the 2 
treatment groups and remained slightly higher than the baseline values. 
Mean Absolute Neutrophil Count Values by Treatment Group and Age Cohort 
When the results were stratified by age cohorts, the mean ANC values in cycle 1 appeared to be 
slightly higher in the lipegfilgrastim group compared to the corresponding age cohorts in the filgrastim 
group. A trend of peak mean ANC concentrations at day 2 and lowest mean concentrations between 
days 6 and 8 were observed in both the treatment groups (ITT Analysis Set; Figure 3). A similar trend 
was observed in both treatment groups across cycles 2 to 4 (in both PP and ITT Analysis Sets).

Figure 3: Mean ANC values at Cycle 1 by treatment group and age cohort (ITT analysis set) 
Absolute Neutrophil Count Nadir Per Chemotherapy Cycle 
Overall, the ANC nadir values were comparable between the lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim 
treatment groups in cycles 1 to 4. The lowest ANC nadir values were recorded in cycle 2 for the 
lipegfilgrastim group and in cycle 1 for the filgrastim group. An ANCOVA model was fitted to evaluate 
the difference between the treatment groups on the ANC nadir controlling for either age or the CTX 
administered in cycle 1. There were no meaningful differences between the 2 treatment groups in the 
mean ANC nadir values using age or CTX administered in cycle 1 as covariates. 
In cycle 1, the mean ANC nadir was lower for the youngest age cohort compared to the 2 older 
age cohorts. Overall, the mean ANC nadir values were lower in patients who received VDC/IE CTX in 
cycle 1 followed by patients who received VAC, VIDE, and IVA. 
Time to ANC Nadir per Cycle 
The time to ANC nadir per cycle was defined as the time from start of CTX/IMP administration 
until occurrence of ANC nadir in the cycle. The mean time to ANC nadir in cycles 1 to 4 was 
similar in the lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim treatment groups from the start of CTX (PP Analysis 
Set, range: 8.8 to 11.0 days) or IMP administration (PP Analysis Set, range: 6.1 to 8.5 days) 
In the lipegfilgrastim group, the mean time to ANC nadir from the start of CTX in cycles 1 to 4 
was shorter for the youngest age cohort (PP Analysis Set, range: 7.3 days to 8.5 days) compared 
to the 2 older age cohorts (PP Analysis Set, range: 8.6 days to 10.0 days). 
In the filgrastim group, the mean time to ANC nadir from the start of CTX in cycle 1 was similar 
in the 2 to <6 years and 12 to <18 years age cohorts (PP Analysis Set, ~10 days), and slightly 
longer compared to the 6 to <12 years age cohort (PP Analysis Set, 9 days). However, in cycles 2 
to 3, the mean time to ANC nadir from the start of CTX was shorter for the youngest age cohort 
(PP Analysis Set, range: 7.7 days to 10.1 days) compared to the 2 older age cohorts. Limited 
inference can be made due to the small number of patients in each age cohort (PP Analysis Set, 
range: 8.4 days to 12.6 days). A similar trend was observed in the meantime to ANC nadir from the 
start of IMP administration. By type of CTX, the mean time to ANC nadir from the start of CTX/IMP 
administration was slightly longer in patients who received VIDE CTX regimen in cycle 1 compared to 
the IVA, VAC, IVADo, and VDC/IE regimen.  
Time to ANC Recovery from the First Day of Chemotherapy 
The mean (SD) time to ANC recovery threshold of ANC >1.0 × 109/L from CTX-day 1 in 
cycle 1 was 10.3 (4.12) days in the lipegfilgrastim group and 11.9 (6.11) days in the filgrastim 
group. The mean (SD) time to ANC recovery threshold of ANC >2.0 × 109/L from CTX-day 1 in 
cycle 1 was 14.2 (4.99) days in the lipegfilgrastim group and 15.3 (3.93) days in the filgrastim 
group. Similar results were seen for cycles 2 to 4. When the results were stratified according to the 
age cohorts, there were no specific trends observed in the mean times to ANC recovery (>1.0 × 109/L 
and >2.0 × 109/L) from CTX-day 1 in both treatment groups.  The mean times to ANC recovery (>1.0

× 109/L) from CTX-day 1 were slightly longer in patients who received doxorubicin based CTX regimen 
(IVADo, VDC/IE, and VIDE) in cycle 1 compared to the patients who received IVA or VAC regimens. In 
contrast, the mean times to ANC recovery (>2.0 × 109/L) from CTX-day 1 were slightly shorter in 
patients who received doxorubicin based CTX regimen (IVADo, VDC/IE, and VIDE) in cycle 1 compared 
to the ‘patients who received IVA or VAC regimens. This could be likely due to a chance and limited 
inference can be made due to the small number of patients under each CTX regimen. 
Time to ANC Recovery from Nadir 
The mean (SD) time to ANC recovery threshold of ANC >1.0 × 109/L from nadir in cycle 1 was 
3.1 (1.76) days in the lipegfilgrastim group and 5.3 (6.1) days in the filgrastim group. The mean 
(SD) time to ANC recovery threshold of ANC >2.0 × 109/L from nadir in cycle 1 was 8.2 (8.30) 
days in the lipegfilgrastim group and 8.5 (7.54) days in the filgrastim group. Similar results were 
seen for cycles 2 to 4. When the results were stratified according to the age cohorts, there were no 
specific trends observed in the mean times to ANC recovery (>1.0 × 109/L and >2.0 × 109/L) from 
nadir in both the treatment groups.  The mean times to ANC recovery (>1.0 × 109/L) from nadir were 
slightly longer in patients who received doxorubicin based CTX regimen (IVADo, VDC/IE, and VIDE) in 
cycle 1 compared to the patients who received IVA or VAC regimens. In contrast, the mean times to 
ANC recovery (>2.0 × 109/L) from nadir were shorter in patients who received doxorubicin based CTX 
regimen (IVADo, VDC/IE, and VIDE) in cycle 1 compared to the patients who received IVA or VAC 
regimens. This could be likely due to a chance and limited inference can be made due to the 
small number of patients under each CTX regimen. 
Rapporteurs comments: 
A major limitation of this study is that no formal hypothesis was tested so the results are, therefore,  
limited to estimates of comparison and it is difficult to draw conclusions from this study. However, the 
trends noted do provide valuable information for lipegfilgrastim in the paediatric population. 
Overall, the distribution of baseline characteristic was balanced between the treatment groups. The 
majority of patients were white and 62% were male. There was a slightly higher proportion of patients 
6 to < 12 years age cohort in the lipegfilgrastim treatment group compared to filgrastim (8 versus 6 
patients) and a slightly lower proportion in the 12<18 group in the lipegfilgrastim compared to 
filgrastim (6 v 8 patients). A higher proportion of patients in the older age groups 6 <18 received VIDE 
CTX regimen compared to the younger age group in each of the treatment groups.  Baseline cancer 
related characteristic were also balanced between the treatment groups.  
Primary endpoint 
The primary end point of DSN in cycle 1,  showed that there were no differences between the 
treatment groups, nor across the age cohorts between the treatment groups. The MAH states in both 
treatment groups, the mean (SD) DSN in patients who received a doxorubicin-based CTX regimen 
VDC/IE and VIDE in cycle 1 was longer compared with patients who received other CTX regimens (IVA 
and VAC). It should be noted, however, that throughout all endpoints in the study, there were no 
patients in the filgrastim group receiving VDC/IE and VAC chemotherapy (Cycle 1), which means a 
comparison cannot be made for this treatment group with lipegfilgrastim receiving patients.  Of the 2 
most frequent CTX regimens used in the study (IVA and VIDE), the mean (SD) DSN was shorter for 
patients who received IVA compared to VIDE. It is encouraging to note that the efficacy of 
lipegfilgrastim was similar to the licenced filgrastim with regards to the primary endpoint. 
Secondary endpoints

the filgrastim treatment group the cycles for treatment groups. There were no significant differences in 
the overall likelihood of severe neutropenia in the age cohorts, but numbers are small, so it is difficult 
to draw conclusions.   There were no notable differences observed in the overall incidence of severe 
neutropenia between the lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim treatment groups when the results were 
stratified by the CTX regimen received in cycle 1. 17 patients in both treatment groups who received 
VIDE CTX in cycle 1 experienced severe neutropenia, whereas approximately 50% of patients who 
received IVA CTX in cycle 1 experienced severe neutropenia.

in the likelihood of experiencing febrile neutropenia in cycles 1 to 4 in the lipegfilgrastim treatment 
group as compared to the filgrastim treatment group. There was no meaningful difference in febrile 
neutropenia in the age cohorts between the treatment groups.  
Concomitant Antibiotics: There was also no difference in the treatment groups in the likelihood of 
experiencing febrile neutropenia in patients who received concomitant prophylactic systemic antibiotics 
and those that did not. 
Hospitalisation: There was no difference in incidence of hospitalisation due to febrile neutropenia 
between the treatment groups. In cycles 2 to 4, there was 1 patient hospitalized in the lipegfilgrastim 
treatment group for a duration ranging from 6 to 10 days. 
Duration of Severe Neutropenia in Cycles 2 to 4 per Cycle: There was no meaningful difference 
in DSN in cycles 2 to 4 per cycle between the treatment groups. There were no meaningful differences 
with regards to age between the treatment groups, however, the numbers were limited so it is difficult 
to draw inferences.   
Incidence of Very Severe Neutropenia in Each Cycle (Cycles 1 to 4): The overall incidence of 
very severe neutropenia was similar between the lipegfilgrastim group and the filgrastim group. There 
was no meaningful difference in the likelihood of experiencing very severe neutropenia in cycles 1 to 4 
in the lipegfilgrastim treatment group as compared to the filgrastim treatment group. There were also 
no meaningful differences in any of the age cohorts in the lipegfilgrastim treatment group in the overall 
likelihood of experiencing very severe neutropenia as compared to the corresponding age cohorts in 
the filgrastim treatment group.  
Duration of Very Severe Neutropenia in Cycles 1 to 4 per Cycle: No meaningful differences were 
found in the DVSN in cycles 1 to 4 between the 2 treatment groups. Similar values for DVSN were seen 
when the results were stratified by age cohorts. The MAH does not describe if there is a difference 
when stratified by CTX regimen. 
Pharmacodynamics Results 
The MAH presents the Pharmacodynamic data from this study but states that the Pharmacokinetic-
pharmacodynamic analysis for patients randomized to receive lipegfilgrastim will be presented in a 
separate population pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic report that will be 
submitted at a later date. Clarification is sought on this strategy from the MAH on this, in terms of the 
overall plan for applying for a paediatric indication. 
More specifically for the secondary endpoint of Mean Absolute Neutrophil Count Values by Treatment 
Group and Age Cohort, the Mean ANC values at cycles 1, 2, 3, and 4 by treatment group and CTX 
administered in cycle 1 are not commented upon by the MAH. 
Safety results 
The MAH states that data from this study indicated that the safety profiles of lipegfilgrastim and 
filgrastim were similar and as expected in children with Ewing family of tumours or rhabdomyosarcoma 
and the results reported here are consistent with the known safety profile of lipegfilgrastim, for which 
no new safety signal was identified.  
The study duration was similar between treatment groups (mean: 100.8 days in the lipegfilgrastim 
group and 95.0 days in the filgrastim group). Overall, lipegfilgrastim was administered 4 times (mean 
value; once per cycle for 4 cycles), and filgrastim was administered 31.7 times (mean value) over 4 
cycles. 
•  All patients were reported with at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) during 
the study. 
• 
Incidence of various categories of TEAEs was similar between the lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim 
treatment groups. 
•  Any treatment-related TEAEs (as assessed by the investigator): 4 (19%) patients versus 2 
(10%) patients. 
•  Any Grade 3 TEAEs: 16 (76%) patients versus 13 (62%) patients. 
•  Any Grade 4 TEAEs: 16 (76%) patients in each treatment group. 
•  Any serious adverse events (SAEs): 12 (57%) patients versus 13 (62%) patients.

Most TEAEs were reported for similar proportions of patients between the lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim 
treatment groups. The most common (≥30% patients in both the treatment groups) system organ 
classes included blood and lymphatic system disorders (86% vs 100%), gastrointestinal disorders 
(67% vs 62%), general disorders and administration site conditions (52% vs 33%), investigations 
(48% vs 33%), and infections and infestations (38% vs 33%). Most TEAEs were reported at PT level 
for similar numbers of patients in each treatment group; most commonly reported in at least 50% of 
patients in any treatment group, were anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and vomiting. 
Non-serious TEAEs were most frequently reported (≥30% patients in any treatment group) in the SOCs 
blood and lymphatic system disorders (lipegfilgrastim: 86%; filgrastim: 100%), gastrointestinal 
disorders (lipegfilgrastim: 67%; filgrastim: 57%), general disorders and administration site conditions 
(lipegfilgrastim: 52%; filgrastim: 33%), investigations (lipegfilgrastim: 48%; filgrastim: 33%), 
infections and infestations (lipegfilgrastim: 38%; filgrastim: 29%), skin and sc tissue disorders 
(lipegfilgrastim: 38%; filgrastim: 24%), metabolism and nutrition disorders (lipegfilgrastim: 33%; 
filgrastim: 0%), and nervous system disorders (lipegfilgrastim: 24%; filgrastim: 38%). 
Anaemia, common in cancer patients undergoing CTX, was reported for approximately 80% of patients 
in each treatment group. The other most common (≥50% patients in any treatment group) preferred 
terms (PTs) were thrombocytopenia (lipegfilgrastim: 62%; filgrastim: 71%), neutropenia 
(lipegfilgrastim: 52%; filgrastim: 48%), and vomiting (lipegfilgrastim: 52%; filgrastim: 38%). 
TEAEs that occurred more frequently (difference between treatment groups ≥10% of patients) with 
lipegfilgrastim than with filgrastim included vomiting, lymphopenia, decreased platelet count, alopecia, 
increased alanine aminotransferase, hyperthermia, hypokalaemia, decreased weight, and decreased 
appetite. TEAEs that occurred more frequently (difference between treatment groups ≥10% of patients) 
with filgrastim than with lipegfilgrastim included leukopenia, febrile neutropenia, stomatitis, and 
headache. Based on the known safety profile of lipegfilgrastim and on patients’ comorbidities in both 
treatment groups, no obvious reason can be found for these numerical differences. 
No notable differences in TEAEs by SOC, PT, or treatment group were observed between age cohorts. 
The most frequently reported Grade 3 TEAE at PT level was anaemia (11 [52%] patients in the 
lipegfilgrastim group and 8 [38%] patients in the filgrastim group). Less frequent Grade 3 TEAE PTs 
(reported in 0 to 5 [24%] patients per treatment group) included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, 
lymphopenia, febrile neutropenia, leukopenia, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, decreased platelet count, 
increased alanine aminotransferase, increased aspartate aminotransferase, increased gamma-
glutamyltransferase, decreased lymphocyte count, increased blood creatine phosphokinase, device-
related infection, and hypokalaemia. 
The most frequently reported Grade 4 TEAEs (≥30% of patients in any group), were thrombocytopenia, 
neutropenia, lymphopenia, and leukopenia. Less frequent Grade 4 TEAE PTs (reported in 0 to 4 [19%] 
patients per treatment group) included anaemia, febrile neutropenia, decreased platelet count, 
decreased neutrophil count, decreased lymphocyte count, decreased white blood cell count, 
hypernatremia, hypocalcaemia, and drug-induced liver injury. 
Treatment-related TEAEs were rarely reported in both treatment groups (4 [19%] patients in 
lipegfilgrastim versus 2 patients [10%] in filgrastim group) and MAH states there were no clinically 
relevant differences in the reporting of treatment-related TEAEs between treatment groups. 
Treatment-related TEAEs reported in at least 1 patient in each treatment group included leucocytosis 
(lipegfilgrastim: 2 [10%] patients; filgrastim: 1 [5%] patient) and monocytosis (1 [5%] patient in each 
group). All other treatment-related TEAE PTs were reported in 1 patient overall, either in the 
lipegfilgrastim group or in the filgrastim group. Most patients had treatment-related TEAEs of either 
mild (Grade 1: 6 patients overall, reported in both treatment groups) or moderate severity (Grade 2: 1 
patient in the lipegfilgrastim group only). 
Treatment-related TEAEs are further detailed below by age cohort  
•  2 to <6 years age cohort: no patient in the lipegfilgrastim group in this age cohort had a 
treatment-related TEAE. One (14%) patient was reported with filgrastim-related TEAE of Grade 
1 pyrexia. 
•  6 to <12 years age cohort: 1 (13%) patient in each SOC was reported with lipegfilgrastim-
related TEAEs of Grade 1 splenomegaly and Grade 1 back pain. In the filgrastim group, 1 
patient (17%) each was reported with Grade 1 treatment related TEAEs of leucocytosis and 
monocytosis.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/CHMP/224703/2019  
Page 20/39 
 
 
 
•  12 to <18 years age cohort: 1 (17%) patient in each SOC was reported with lipegfilgrastim-
related TEAEs of Grade 1 and Grade 2 leucocytosis, Grade 1 monocytosis, and Grade 1 
headache. None in the filgrastim group in this age cohort had a treatment-related TEAE. 
Similar proportions of patients in both treatment groups (~60%) were reported with at least 1 SAE 
during the study. Most SAEs occurred with similar frequencies among the treatment groups. A few 
SAEs were reported more frequently (>10% difference) in 1 group or the other: SAEs more common in 
the lipegfilgrastim group were thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia; and SAEs more common in the 
filgrastim group were leukopenia and febrile neutropenia. Among all SAEs, only 1 (Grade 1 pyrexia) in 
the filgrastim group was considered related to treatment. There were no SAEs that were related to the 
treatment with lipegfilgrastim.  
There were minor differences in the incidence of SAEs in the corresponding age across the treatment 
groups. However, given the low number of patients included in study, these differences were not 
considered clinically relevant by the MAH: 
2 to <6 years: there were 5/7 (71%) patients in the lipegfilgrastim group and 6/7 (86%) patients in 
the filgrastim group who experienced at least 1 SAE during the study: 
•  SAEs with higher incidence in the lipegfilgrastim (≥2 patients difference) group compared to 
the filgrastim group: thrombocytopenia (3 [43%] patients vs 0 patients), and lymphopenia (4 
[57%] patients vs 2 [29%] patients). 
•  SAEs with lower incidence in the lipegfilgrastim (≥2 patients difference) group compared to the 
filgrastim group: anaemia (2 [29%] patients vs 0 patients), leukopenia (3 [43%] patients vs 0 
patients), and febrile neutropenia (3 [43%] patients vs 0 patients). 
6 to <12 years: there were 3/8 (38%) patients in the lipegfilgrastim group and 5/6 (83%) 
patients in the filgrastim group who experienced at least 1 SAE during the study: 
•  SAE with higher incidence in the lipegfilgrastim (≥2 patients difference) group compared to the 
filgrastim group: anaemia (2 [25%] patients vs 0 patients). 
• 
There were no other SAEs in this age cohort that were reported more frequently (≥2 patients 
difference) in 1 group or the other. 
12 to <18 years: there were 4/6 (67%) patients in the lipegfilgrastim group and 2/8 (25%) 
patients in the filgrastim group who experienced at least 1 SAE during the study: 
• 
• 
 SAEs with higher incidence in the lipegfilgrastim (≥2 patients difference) group compared to 
the filgrastim group: thrombocytopenia (4 [67%] patients vs 1 [13%] patient), and 
neutropenia (2 [33%] patients vs 0 patients). 
There were no other SAEs in this age cohort that were reported more frequently (≥2 patients 
difference) in 1 group or the other. 
For 2 (10%) patients in the lipegfilgrastim group and 4 (19%) patients in the filgrastim group, the 
SAEs were of Grade 3 severity. For 12 (57%) patients in the lipegfilgrastim group and 11 (52%) 
patients in the filgrastim group, the SAEs were of Grade 4 severity. The incidence of SAEs in different 
age cohorts by toxicity grade, across the treatment groups is summarized below: 
2 to <6 years 
•  Grade 3: no patient in the lipegfilgrastim group experienced a Grade 3 SAE. Two (29%) 
patients in the filgrastim group experienced Grade 3 SAEs (anaemia in 2 patients, and febrile 
neutropenia, neutropenia, and stomatitis in 1 patient each). 
•  Grade 4: 5 (71%) patients in the lipegfilgrastim group and 6 (86%) patients in the filgrastim 
group experienced Grade 4 SAEs (lymphopenia in 4 and 2 patients, thrombocytopenia in 3 and 
0 patients, febrile neutropenia in 0 and 2 patients, leukopenia in 0 and 3 patients, decreased 
lymphocyte count in 0 and 1 patients, and decreased platelet count in 0 and 1 patients, 
respectively). 
6 to <12 years 
•  Grade 3: experienced by 1 (13%) patient in the lipegfilgrastim group (anaemia) and 1 patient 
(17%) in the filgrastim group (device related infection).

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/CHMP/224703/2019  
Page 21/39 
 
 
 
•  Grade 4: 3 (38%) patients in the lipegfilgrastim group and 4 (67%) patients in the filgrastim 
group experienced Grade 4 SAEs (anaemia in 1 and 0 patients, febrile neutropenia in 0 and 1 
patient, neutropenia in 0 and 1 patient, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia in 2 patients in 
each group, leukopenia in 1 patient in each group, hypernatraemia and hypocalcaemia in 1 
patient each in the filgrastim group). 
12 to <18 years 
• 
 Grade 3: 1 patient each in the lipegfilgrastim group (17%) and the filgrastim group (13%) 
experienced Grade 3 SAEs (anaemia, nausea, and vomiting in 1 patient each in the 
lipegfilgrastim group only; and febrile neutropenia in 1patient in filgrastim group). 
•  Grade 4: 4 (67%) patients in the lipegfilgrastim group and 1 (13%) patient in the filgrastim 
group experienced Grade 4 SAEs (thrombocytopenia in 4 and 1 patients, neutropenia in 2 and 
0 patients, febrile neutropenia in 1 and 0 patients, leukopenia in 1 patient in each group, 
lymphopenia in 1 and 0 patients, platelet count decreased in 1 and 0 patients, and drug-
induced liver injury in 0 and 1 patient, respectively). 
TEAEs leading to study discontinuation were rare and reported only for 2 patients, both in filgrastim 
group and in the age cohort 12 to <18 years, accounting for 10% of the patients in this treatment 
group. The events were leukopenia and neutropenia in 1 patient and drug-induced liver injury in the 
other patient. The events were considered related to CTX but not to filgrastim treatment by the 
investigator.  
No deaths (Grade 5 TEAEs) were reported during the treatment period of the study. Two deaths were 
reported due to disease progression during the follow-up period (both in the filgrastim group).  
There were no unexpected clinically meaningful trends observed in the mean changes from baseline for 
any of the serum chemistry or haematology parameters during the study. Individual shifts were 
reported as TEAEs in the SOC investigations in few patients in both treatment groups: ALT increased (4 
[19%] patients in the lipegfilgrastim group and 1 [5%] patient in the filgrastim group), AST increased 
(3 [14%] and 1 [5%]), GGT increased (3 [14%] and 1 [5%]), and blood bilirubin increased (none in 
the lipegfilgrastim group and 1 [5%] patient in the filgrastim group). Seven (33%) patients in the 
lipegfilgrastim group and 3 (14%) patients in the filgrastim group had potentially clinically significant 
abnormal serum chemistry values. Most commonly reported (1 to 4 patients per treatment group) 
were: ALT, AST, and GGT increases. Other potential abnormalities were uncommon (0 to 1 patient per 
group). There were no clinically relevant differences in the reporting of potential abnormalities between 
treatment groups, overall and by age cohort. 
Mean changes in the haematology parameters from baseline to EOS/or ET were similar between 
treatment groups, overall and by age cohort (Summary 15.3.6.2.2; Listing 16.2.8.3). These changes 
were not considered clinically relevant. A few patients had shifts from normal values at baseline to 
abnormal values at EOS/or ET in haematology parameters (Table 54). Several individual shifts were 
reported as TEAEs in the SOC investigations: decreased platelet count (5 [24%] patients in the 
lipegfilgrastim group and 3 [14%] patients in the filgrastim group), decreased neutrophil count (3 
[14%] and 1 [5%]), and leukopenia (3 [14%] patients in the lipegfilgrastim group and 10 [48%] 
patients in the filgrastim group). Both overall and by age cohort, there were no clinically relevant 
differences in the reporting of shifts for haematology parameters between groups. Overall and by age 
cohort, there were no clinically relevant differences in the frequencies of patients with potentially 
clinically significant abnormal haematology values between treatment groups. 
Lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim had no clinically significant effects on QTc, heart rate, or cardiac 
conduction, i.e., the PR and QRS intervals. There were no clinically relevant arrhythmias or 
morphological abnormalities observed post-dosing. One patient in the lipegfilgrastim group was 
reported with a TEAE of injection site pain. One patient each in the filgrastim group was reported with 
TEAEs of injection site hematoma and injection site abscess. None of the patients had shifts from 
normal spleen sonography findings at baseline to abnormal and clinically significant findings at the 
EOS/or ET visit 
Rapporteurs comments: 
The MAH reports that the safety profiles of lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim are similar. The MAH also 
states that the data presented are consistent with the known safety profile of lipegfilgrastim and 
expected in children with Ewing family of tumours and rhabdomyosarcoma undergoing chemotherapy. 
The Rapporteur agrees with these statements; however, the following comments are made: 
TEAE

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

Page 22/39 
 
 
 
The MAH states that TEAE were similar between the lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim treatment groups.   
The most common adverse events (≥30% patients in both the treatment groups) in the system organ 
classes included blood and lymphatic system disorders (86% vs 100%), gastrointestinal disorders 
(67% vs 62%), general disorders and administration site conditions (52% vs 33%), investigations 
(48% vs 33%), and infections and infestations (38% vs 33%). The frequencies of patients with TEAEs 
by SOC were considered similar between treatment groups by the MAH. Most TEAEs were reported at 
PT level for similar numbers of patients in each treatment group; most common reported in at least 
50% of patients in any treatment group, were anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and vomiting. 
TEAEs that occurred more frequently (difference between treatment groups ≥10% of patients) with 
lipegfilgrastim than with filgrastim included vomiting, lymphopenia, decreased platelet count, alopecia, 
increased alanine aminotransferase, hyperthermia, hypokalaemia, decreased weight and appetite. 
TEAEs that occurred more frequently (difference between treatment groups ≥10% of patients) with 
filgrastim than with lipegfilgrastim included leukopenia, febrile neutropenia, stomatitis, and headache.  
The MAH’s statement ‘Based on the known safety profile of lipegfilgrastim and also on patients 
comorbidities in both treatment groups, no obvious reason can be found for these numerical 
differences’ is acceptable especially in patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy. As, however, 
the MAH was not able to explain this difference, the safety profile should be continued to be monitored 
in future, during ongoing studies and post marketing monitoring activities. 
TEAEs by grade were reported for similar proportions of patients across treatment groups, including for 
Grade 3 TEAEs and Grade 4 TEAEs. The most frequently reported Grade 3 TEAE at PT level was 
anaemia (11 [52%] patients in the lipegfilgrastim group and 8 [38%] patients in the filgrastim group). 
Less frequent Grade 3 TEAE PTs (reported in 0 to 5 [24%] patients per treatment group) included 
thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, febrile neutropenia, leukopenia, nausea, vomiting, 
stomatitis, decreased platelet count, increased alanine aminotransferase, increased aspartate 
aminotransferase, increased gamma-glutamyltransferase, decreased lymphocyte count, increased 
blood creatine phosphokinase, device-related infection, and hypokalaemia. The most frequently 
reported Grade 4 TEAEs (≥30% of patients in any group), were thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, 
lymphopenia, and leukopenia. Less frequent Grade 4 TEAE PTs (reported in 0 to 4 [19%] patients per 
treatment group) included anaemia, febrile neutropenia, decreased platelet count, decreased 
neutrophil count, decreased lymphocyte count, decreased white blood cell count, hypernatraemia, 
hypocalcaemia, and drug-induced liver injury.  
No notable differences in TEAEs by SOC, PT, or treatment group were observed between age cohorts, 
but numbers are small so conclusions are limited. 
Treatment-related TEAE 
Treatment-related TEAEs were rarely reported in both treatment groups (4 [19%] patients in 
lipegfilgrastim versus 2 patients [10%] in filgrastim group). The MAH states there were no clinically 
relevant differences in the reporting of treatment-related TEAEs between treatment groups. 
Treatment-related TEAE reported in at least 1 patient in each treatment group included leukocytosis 
(lipegfilgrastim: 2 [10%] patients; filgrastim: 1 [5%] patient) and monocytosis (1 [5%] patient in each 
group). Although leucocytosis is mentioned within the lipegfilgrastim SmPC (Section 4.8), monocytosis 
is not highlighted. The MAH is asked to comment on whether monocytosis is a new finding for 
lipegfilgrastim treatment and whether it is paediatric specific.  
All other treatment-related TEAE PTs were reported in 1 patient overall, either in the lipegfilgrastim 
group or in the filgrastim group. The MAH is asked to clarify the nature of these treatment-related 
TEAE and if these are a new finding for lipegfilgrastim treatment or paediatric specific. 
Most patients had treatment-related TEAEs of either mild (Grade 1: 6 patients overall, reported in both 
treatment groups) or moderate severity (Grade 2: 1 patient in the lipegfilgrastim group only). The 
MAH is asked to give further details on any differences between the treatment groups for severity of 
treatment -related TEAE and clarify if any of these are new for lipegfilgrastim or paediatric specific. 
In the age cohorts 2< 6 years there were no lipegfilgrastim-related TEAE and 1 (14%) patient was 
reported with filgrastim-related TEAE (pyrexia). In the 6 to <12 years age cohort: 1 (13%) patient in 
each SOC was reported with lipegfilgrastim-related TEAEs of Grade 1 splenomegaly and Grade 1 back 
pain. In the filgrastim group, 1 patient (17%) each was reported with Grade 1 treatment related TEAEs 
of leucocytosis and monocytosis. 12 to <18 years age cohort: 1 (17%) patient in each SOC was 
reported with lipegfilgrastim-related TEAEs of Grade 1 and Grade 2 leucocytosis, Grade 1 monocytosis,

and Grade 1 headache. No patients in the filgrastim group in this age cohort had a treatment-related 
TEAE. It is recognised that the numbers in the age cohorts are small so conclusions are limited.  
SAE 
Most SAE occurred with similar frequency (approximately 60% in both groups). A few SAEs were 
reported more frequently (>10% difference) in 1 group or the other: SAEs more common in the 
lipegfilgrastim group were thrombocytopenia (9 patients in lipegfilgrastim group; 3 patients in 
filgrastim group) and lymphopenia (7 patients in lipegfilgrastim group; 4 patients in filgrastim group). 
SAEs more common in the filgrastim group were leukopenia and febrile neutropenia. Among all SAEs, 
only 1 (Grade 1 pyrexia) in the filgrastim group was considered related to treatment. The MAH reports 
that there were no SAEs related to treatment with lipegfilgrastim. As described in this report, there 
were minor differences in the incidence of SAE between age cohorts, but it is difficult to draw 
conclusions due to limited numbers and these were not considered clinically relevant by MAH (refer to 
page 22-23). 
Discontinuation and Deaths  
TEAEs leading to study discontinuation were reported only for 2 patients, both in filgrastim group. The 
events were leukopenia and neutropenia in 1 patient and drug-induced liver injury in the other patient. 
The events were considered related to CTX but not to filgrastim treatment by the investigator. No 
deaths (Grade 5 TEAEs) were reported during the treatment period of the study. Two deaths were 
reported due to disease progression during the follow-up period (both in the filgrastim group). 
For the safety events monitored (TEAE, SAE and treatment related TEAE) the MAH gives data on age 
cohorts but not CTX groups. The MAH is asked to confirm if CTX data was collected and if so provide 
information regarding results and interpretation (and to specifically comment if there were any 
differences seen in the treatment groups and age cohorts for the AE, TEAE, SAE and treatment related 
TEAE). 
As well as the questions posed above, the MAH is asked to clarify if any are paediatric specific AE, SAE 
TEAE or treatment related TEAE and which, if any, are regarded as new events for lipegfilgrastim.   
It should be noted that the SmPC for LONQUEX does not include the following events described within 
this study XM22-08:   
-Gastrointestinal disorders, vomiting, nausea, decreased weight, and decreased appetite. 
-Infections and infestations, device related infection 
-Blood and lymphatic disorders are mentioned but the following are not specifically highlighted: 
neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, lymphopenia, leukopenia, anaemia, monocytosis.  
-Although investigations are mentioned increased alanine aminotransferase, increased aspartate 
aminotransferase, increased gamma-glutamyltransferase, increased blood creatine phosphokinase, 
hypernatraemia, hypocalcaemia, are not described where other investigation abnormalities are 
described within the SmPC. 
-Although skin and subcutaneous disorders are mentioned alopecia, hyperthermia, stomatitis are not 
highlighted.  
-Pyrexia, rhinitis, polyneuropathy, constipation, epistaxis, bronchitis, cough, and mucosal 
inflammation.  
These events are mostly AE or TEAE but are some are amongst the most common occurring in both 
treatment groups (e.g. gastrointestinal and infection and infestations). It is recognised that these 
events are occurring in a patient population with cancer undergoing chemotherapy. The MAH, however, 
should continue to monitor these events in future and ongoing studies as well as post marketing 
surveillance.  
OVERVIEW OF IMMUNOGENICITY 
Immunogenicity data for lipegfilgrastim in adults are summarized in the LONQUEX Summary of Product 
Characteristics and European Public Assessment Report. Study XM22-07 provides the first clinical 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/CHMP/224703/2019

immunogenicity data for lipegfilgrastim in the paediatric population. Results from this study have 
already been submitted. In Study XM22-08, blood samples of approximately 2.0 mL for 
immunogenicity assessment were collected at baseline and prior to CTX and lipegfilgrastim 
administration in cycle 2 (pre-dose), at the EOS/or ET, and during follow-up visits on days 180 (±2 
weeks) and 365 (±2 weeks) as part of the study’s safety follow-up measures. In case an antibody 
result at day 365 raised a concern, additional testing was suggested. 
A total of 94 samples from 21 patients in the lipegfilgrastim group were collected between 11 
September 2015 and 28 March 2018. For 3 patients, samples were available until EOS/or ET visit; for 1 
patient until day 180; and for 17 patients until day 365. An interim sample analysis report was 
prepared including results from the samples collected up to 28 March 2018. The number and 
percentage of patients with positive results will be summarized by visit and overall, after the follow-up 
period of the study. The final sample analysis report will include results from all the study samples and 
will be submitted as an addendum to XM22-08 CSR at a later date. Seven samples from 4 patients had 
confirmed presence of anti-drug antibody (ADA), including 3 patients with pre-existing ADAs (i.e., 
positive baseline samples). Of the 7 samples with confirmed presence of ADA, 3 tested positive for 
specific binding to anti-recombinant human G-CSF (XM21) and/or G-CSF, 3 tested positive for specific 
binding to cytidine monophosphate-sialic acid-polyethylene glycol (cPEG), and 1 did not test positive 
for binding to either XM21/G-CSF or cPEG. 
One patient who was baseline negative had ADA positive samples at cycle 2 CTX-day 1 and at EOS/or 
ET visit. The 2 positive samples had a low titer (<1) and were not specific for anti-XM21 or anti–G-
CSF; 1 sample was non-neutralizing and the other could not be analysed for neutralization due to 
insufficient quantity. Samples at day 180 and at day 365 for this patient were ADA negative. The titer 
of all positive samples was low (titer <1.0). The 7 samples with confirmed presence of ADA were 
tested for presence of neutralizing antibodies. Two of these samples were confirmed positive for 
specific neutralization. Since both positive samples were collected at baseline, detected neutralizing 
antibodies were not considered to be treatment-related. Four samples tested negative for the presence 
of neutralizing antibodies. 
Rapporteurs comments: 
The MAH is asked to comment on the clinical relevance of the immunogenicity results and relate them 
to existing knowledge of lipegfilgrastim in children.  
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
MAH POSITION ON BENEFITS AND RISKS CONCLUSIONS 
Study XM22-08 was the second paediatric study with lipegfilgrastim. Both studies were performed in 
paediatric patients 2 to <18 years of age with Ewing family of tumours or rhabdomyosarcoma 
receiving CTX. The first Study XM22-07 was an open-label, non-controlled study performed to assess 
the PK, pharmacodynamics, efficacy, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a single, sc dose of 
100 μg/kg BW lipegfilgrastim in 21 children. Study XM22-08 was an open-label, active-controlled study 
performed to assess the efficacy, PK, pharmacodynamics, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 
lipegfilgrastim 100 μg/kg BW in comparison to daily filgrastim 5 μg/kg BW in 42 children. The primary 
objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of a single sc dose of 100 μg/kgBW of lipegfilgrastim 
per cycle compared to daily sc doses of 5 μg/kg BW of filgrastim in children receiving CTX. Note that 
no formal hypothesis testing was performed as the study was not powered for it; conclusions were 
limited to providing estimates of the means of treatments and their differences. There was no 
meaningful difference in the DSN in cycle 1 between the 2 treatment groups. The mean (SD) DSN in 
cycle 1 in the lipegfilgrastim group was 2.7 (2.25) days and in the filgrastim group 2.5 (2.09) days (PP 
Analysis Set). A Poisson regression analysis with factors of treatment and age cohort, and baseline 
(before IMP administration) ANC value as covariate was fitted. The least squares mean difference 
(lipegfilgrastim minus filgrastim) was 1.0 (95% CI: –0.21, 2.26; P = 0.102) in the PP Analysis Set and 
0.4 (95% CI: –0.92, 1.72; P = 0.543) in the ITT Analysis Set. In addition, there were no notable 
differences in the DSN in cycle 1 between the corresponding age cohorts across the treatment groups. 
These results were consistent with the results obtained in Study XM22-07. In Study XM22-07, the 
mean (SD) DSN was 0.7 (1.2) days in the 2 to <6 years age cohort, 2.4 (1.9) days in the 6 to <12 
years age cohort, and 3.1 (1.9) days in the 12 to <18 years age cohort. In the current Study XM22-08, 
the mean (SD) DSN in the lipegfilgrastim group (PP Analysis Set) was 2.0 (1.55) days in the 2 to <6

years age cohort, 2.8 (2.31) days in the 6 to <12 years age cohort, and 3.3 (2.88) days in the 12 to 
<18 years age cohort. Similar results for DSN were seen in the filgrastim group. 
In addition, in both the treatment groups, the mean (SD) DSN in patients who received doxorubicin-
based CTX VDC/IE and VIDE in cycle 1 was longer compared to the patients who received other CTX 
regimens (IVA or VAC). Of the 2 most frequent CTX regimens administered in the study (IVA and 
VIDE), the mean (SD) DSN was shorter for patients who received IVA compared to VIDE 
(lipegfilgrastim: 0.4 [0.53] days vs 4.1 [1.54] days; filgrastim: 0.4 [0.79] days vs 3.9 [1.13] days; PP 
Analysis Set). This could be attributed to the higher myelotoxicity expected with doxorubicin-based 
CTX regimens, particularly for the older paediatric patients (6 to <12 years and 12 to <18 years) who 
received a higher proportion of the VIDE CTX regimen as compared to other CTX regimens. In 
summary, as the type of CTX regimen administered was different across the age cohorts, no clear 
conclusion can be drawn regarding a relationship between DSN and the age of the patients. 
The results of the secondary endpoints of the study were supportive of the primary endpoint results. 
There were no meaningful differences between the lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim treatment groups with 
respect to the incidence of severe neutropenia (85% vs 84%), febrile neutropenia (35% vs 42%), 
hospitalization due to febrile neutropenia (5% in each treatment group), DSN in cycle 2 to 4 (~2 days 
in both groups), and DVSN (~1 day in both groups). Also, no relevant differences between the 
corresponding age cohorts were found. 
As in Study XM22-07, a trend of higher incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients who received VIDE 
CTX compared to other CTX regimens was observed also in this study. This is in line with published 
data in paediatric patients with Ewing sarcoma, in which patients developed febrile neutropenia after 
78% of VIDE cycles with pegfilgrastim administration an after 56% VIDE cycles with filgrastim. After 
less myelosuppressive vincristine plus actinomycin plus ifosfamide (VAI) and VAC CTX, the incidence of 
febrile neutropenia was 0% with pegfilgrastim and 5% with filgrastim administration (Wendelin et al 
2005). André et al. reported febrile neutropenia in 47% of pegfilgrastim-treated paediatric cancer 
patients after VIDE, 4% after VAC, and 33% (2 of 6 cases) after VAI (André et al 2007). However, 
when the results of Study XM22-08 were stratified by CTX regimen in cycle 1, there were no 
differences in the overall likelihood of experiencing febrile neutropenia between any of the 
corresponding age cohorts of the lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim treatment groups. Similarly, there was 
no difference in the overall likelihood of experiencing febrile neutropenia irrespective of concomitant 
prophylactic systemic antibiotics use between the lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim treatment groups. 
The pharmacodynamic results in this study provided additional evidence supporting similar efficacy of 
lipegfilgrastim as compared to filgrastim. The geometric mean AUCANC until day 15 in the 
lipegfilgrastim group was higher compared to the filgrastim group (104.9473 × 109/L*days vs 84.2795 
× 109/L*days; PP Analysis Set). When the results were stratified by age cohorts and the CTX regimen 
administered in cycle 1, there were no meaningful differences in the mean AUCANC values between the 
lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim treatment groups and between the corresponding age cohorts. Also, there 
were no meaningful differences between the 2 treatment groups in the mean AUCANC values in cycle 1, 
mean ANC nadir values in cycles 1 to 4, mean time to ANC nadir in cycles 1 to 4 from start of CTX or 
IMP administration, and mean times to ANC recovery thresholds of ANC >1.0 × 109/L and ANC >2.0 × 
109/L in cycles 1 to 4. 
The study duration was similar between treatment groups (mean: 100.8 days in the lipegfilgrastim 
group and 95.0 days in the filgrastim group). Overall, lipegfilgrastim was administered 4 times (mean 
value; once per cycle for 4 cycles), and filgrastim was administered 31.7 times (mean value) over 4 
cycles. Lipegfilgrastim could be advantageous over filgrastim owing to its lesser frequency of 
administration (once per cycle) and increased compliance compared to daily administration of 
filgrastim. 
No concerns about the safety of lipegfilgrastim were raised by the TEAEs reported in the study. All 
enrolled patients experienced at least 1 TEAE during the study. There were no notable differences in 
the incidences of various categories of TEAEs between the 2 treatment groups. The numerical 
differences in the reporting of PTs between the groups were considered due to chance. The most 
common (≥30% patients in both the treatment groups) system organ classes included blood and 
lymphatic system disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, general disorders and administration site 
conditions, investigations, and infections and infestations. Anaemia, common in cancer patients 
undergoing CTX, was reported for approximately 80% of patients in each treatment group. The other 
most common (≥50% patients) PTs were thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and vomiting. Treatment-
related TEAEs were rare and reported in 19% of patients in the lipegfilgrastim group and 10% of 
patients in the filgrastim group and were mild or moderate in severity (Grade 1 or 2). Any Grade 3 
TEAEs were reported in 76% of patients in the lipegfilgrastim group and 62% of patients in the

filgrastim group. The most frequently reported Grade 3 TEAE at PT level was anaemia (52% of patients 
in the lipegfilgrastim group and 38% of patients in the filgrastim group). All other Grade 3 TEAEs were 
reported in 0 to 5 (24%) patients per treatment group. Any Grade 4 TEAEs were reported in 76% of 
patients in each of the treatment groups. The most frequently reported Grade 4 TEAEs (≥30% of 
patients in any group) were thrombocytopenia neutropenia, lymphopenia, and leukopenia. All other 
Grade 4 TEAEs were reported in 0 to 4(19%) patients per treatment group. Approximately 60% of 
patients in both treatment groups experienced SAEs during the study. Among all SAEs, only 1 SAE in 
the entire study was considered treatment-related and occurred in the filgrastim group (Grade 1 
pyrexia). Adverse events leading to study discontinuation were uncommon and reported only for 2 
patients, both in the filgrastim group and in the age cohort of 12 to <18 years. The events were 
leukopenia and neutropenia in 1 patient and drug-induced liver injury in the other patient. The events 
were considered related to CTX but not to filgrastim treatment by the investigator. There were no 
unexpected clinically meaningful trends observed in the mean changes from baseline for any of the 
serum chemistry or haematology parameters during the study. The assessment of the ventricular 
repolarization risk based on the change from baseline QT interval corrected by Fridericia correction 
formula did not indicate that a single dose of lipegfilgrastim of 100 μg/kg per cycle holds any QTc 
liability. Evaluation of other ECG time intervals demonstrated the absence of potential meaningful 
drug-induced change in heart rate, prolongation of PR or QRS duration, as well as clinically relevant 
abnormalities following lipegfilgrastim administration. Interim analysis of the immunogenicity results 
(samples collected between 11 September 2015 and 28 March 2018) identified a single patient with 
baseline negative had ADA positive samples at cycle 2 CTX-day 1 and at EOS/or ET visit. These 2 
positive samples had a low titer (<1) and were not specific for anti-XM21 and anti–GCSF; 1 sample 
was non-neutralizing and the other could not be analysed for neutralization due to insufficient quantity. 
Samples at day 180 and at day 365 for this patient were ADA negative. 
The MAH states safety results in this study were consistent with the known safety profile lipegfilgrastim 
and were similar to the safety profile of filgrastim indicating its safe use in children with Ewing family 
of tumours or rhabdomyosarcoma receiving CTX. 
MAH POSITION ON Limitations of the XM22-08 Study Design 
The XM22-08 study was designed as the second of 2 paediatric studies required as measures of a PIP, 
with the primary objective to assess the efficacy of a single dose of lipegfilgrastim 100 μg/kg BW in 
comparison to approved standard treatment with filgrastim in the paediatric population. As such, an 
open-label, active-controlled study was considered appropriate to support the primary objective of this 
study. The sample size of 42 patients (21 patients per treatment group) was selected based on 
practicality and feasibility (expected low recruitment rate in the population under investigation). A 
sample size of 21 patients per treatment group was expected to allow the estimation of mean DSN in 
cycle 1. Study XM22-08 investigated 4 cycles of lipegfilgrastim treatment, which reflects a typical 
clinical setting. To facilitate recruitment of cancer patients from the age of 2 to <18 years, 5 different 
CTX regimens were permissible in Study XM22-08. As the myelosuppressive effect of CTX varies across 
CTX regimen, the comparison of results across age groups can be complicated when the CTX regimens 
are not equally distributed by age group. This was indeed the case in the XM22-08 study but was 
addressed by appropriate analysis of the study data by type of CTX in addition to age group. Both 
studies did not include children below the age of 2 years. To overcome this limitation in data it was 
agreed in the PIP that an extrapolation study will be performed to model PK and pharmacodynamic 
data from studies XM22-07 and XM22-08 to children below the age of 2 years. 
MAH POSITION ON Overall Benefit-risk Assessment of Lipegfilgrastim in Paediatric Patients 
Studies XM22-07 and XM22-08 investigated 21 and 42 paediatric patients, respectively, with Ewing 
family of tumours or rhabdomyosarcoma who received a single sc injection of lipegfilgrastim 100 μg/kg 
BW per CTX cycle. In study XM22-08 it was shown that there were no notable differences in the DSN in 
cycle 1 between the corresponding age cohorts across the treatment groups, and the results raised no 
concerns regarding the PK, safety, or immunogenicity profile of lipegfilgrastim. 
In the PK Study XM22-07, maximum mean serum lipegfilgrastim concentration (Cmax) was reached at 
(tmax) 50.3 hours (292 ±178 ng/mL) in the 2 to <6 years group, 45.4 hours (303 ±144 ng/mL) in the 
6 to <12 years group, and 82.2 hours (341 ±381 ng/mL) in the 12 to <18 years group. Analysis of 
covariance revealed no detectable difference in PK parameters of interest (Cmax, area under the 
serum concentration-time curve, apparent volume of distribution during the terminal phase after non-
intravenous administration, and apparent clearance) among age groups. More importantly, the average 
Cmax values and Cmax variability were comparable across the age groups, supporting the use of a 
BW-adjusted dose to achieve comparable initial peak exposure levels of lipegfilgrastim.

Key efficacy endpoints in clinical studies with G-CSFs are the incidence of febrile neutropenia and the 
DSN. Results for these endpoints in the non-controlled Study XM22-07 as well as in the active-
controlled Study XM22-08 (comparing lipegfilgrastim with filgrastim, which is approved for use in 
paediatric cancer patients) are consistent with those previously observed with pegfilgrastim and 
filgrastim and appear to be associated with the type of CTX administered rather than the age of the 
patients. As the type of CTX administered differed across the age groups, no clear conclusion can be 
drawn regarding a relationship between efficacy and the age of the patients. Similar trends were seen 
with the pharmacodynamic results. Safety endpoints in these trials included adverse events, clinical 
laboratory results, ECG results, spleen sonography, injection site reactions, and immunogenicity. 
Survival in the follow-up period was assessed in Study XM22-07. The evaluations indicated a safety 
profile consistent with that seen in adult trials with lipegfilgrastim 
The death of 1 child with rhabdomyosarcoma during the follow-up period in Study XM22-07 was 
attributed to disease progression and was not regarded as lipegfilgrastim-related. In Study XM22-08, 
the 2 death cases observed in the filgrastim group during the follow-up period (1 patient with 
rhabdomyosarcoma and 1 patient with Ewing sarcoma) were also attributed to disease progression and 
not considered as related to filgrastim. 
Regarding the immunogenicity in Study XM22-07, 1 patient developed a low titer ADA response in this 
study post-treatment with lipegfilgrastim and several doses of commercial filgrastim. The patient had a 
positive sample at day 180 only. This sample was not neutralizing and only specific for the cPEG-
moiety. Four other patients were considered to have pre-existing ADA towards lipegfilgrastim (specific 
for cPEG or both G-CSF and cPEG moieties), but there was no treatment-related ADA response. In 
Study XM22-08, immunogenicity data were obtained only for patients in the lipegfilgrastim group. 
Interim analysis of the immunogenicity results (samples collected between 11 September 2015 and 28 
March 2018) identified 7 samples from 4 patients with confirmed presence of ADAs, including 3 
patients with pre-existing ADAs (i.e., positive baseline samples). A single patient was baseline negative 
and had ADA positive samples at cycle 2 CTX-day 1 and at EOS/or ET visit. These 2 positive samples 
had a low titer (<1) and were not specific for anti-XM21 and anti–G-CSF; 1 sample was non-
neutralizing and the other could not be analysed for neutralization due to insufficient quantity. Samples 
at day 180 and at day 365 for this patient were ADA negative. In conclusion for these 2 studies, no 
patient developed a persistent ADA response, all positive samples had low titres and were not 
neutralizing. 
Overall, while a future population PK analysis will produce a more definitive evaluation of dose with 
respect to patient demographic factors (age, weight, gender) and treatment (e.g., CTX), the safety, 
PK, efficacy, and pharmacodynamic data reviewed in these 2 trials support a continued positive 
benefit-risk assessment for lipegfilgrastim in the paediatric population. 
3.  Rapporteur’s conclusion and recommendation 
Currently lipegfilgrastim is not licensed for use in children. The information provided in this study is 
encouraging in terms of efficacy and safety of lipegfilgrastim, however, the study has the limitation of 
lack of testing of a formal hypothesis and lack of powering.   
There are other limitations including the heterogeneity of the study population (in terms of underlying 
cancer, Ewing’s and rhabdomyosarcoma) as well as the 5 different chemotherapy regimens allowed. 
Due to the limited number of patients in the different age cohorts, it is challenging to draw conclusions 
from these data.  
The primary endpoint showed that there was no meaningful difference in the DSN in cycle 1 for 
lipegfilgrastim compared to filgrastim; and there were no notable differences between the treatments 
across the age cohorts. In both treatments, the mean DSN in subjects who received VDC/IE and VIDE 
in cycle 1 was longer compared with patients who received other CTX regimens. Of the 2 most 
frequent CTX regimens used in the study (IVA and VIDE), the mean (SD) DSN was shorter for patients 
who received IVA compared to VIDE. It should be noted, however, that there were no patients in the 
filgrastim group with VDC/IE and VAC treatment, which means a comparison cannot be made for this 
group with lipegfilgrastim.  
The secondary endpoints also provide valuable supporting information for the primary endpoint and 
pharmacodynamic data. The safety profile of lipegfilgrastim has also been further determined within 
the paediatric population in this study and many of the adverse events described are known. The MAH 
states safety results in this study were consistent with the known safety profile lipegfilgrastim and 
were similar to the safety profile of filgrastim indicating its safe use in children with Ewing family of

tumours or rhabdomyosarcoma receiving CTX. However, there are safety findings described in this 
study which require further clarification.  
The Rapporteur is aware that the final study in the paediatric development plan, a study to extrapolate 
efficacy the paediatric population less than 2 years of age is due to be completed in January 2019.  A 
paediatric indication remains the aim of the paediatric development programme which includes the 
development of an age appropriate formulation of a single dose vial. The MAH is asked to clarify their 
overall strategy and timing of applying for a paediatric indication and which data they are awaiting 
before seeking that indication.  
Recommendation  
An update to the SmPC is recommended when any new and relevant information becomes available. 
This allows clinicians to be informed about new studies regarding lipegfilgrastim without supporting off 
label, unlicensed use or endangering the paediatric development plan. The efficacy and safety data 
presented in Study XM22-08, therefore, warrants an update to the SmPC. The MAH is asked to provide 
wording to update sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC for consideration for inclusion in the SmPC, 
reflecting the limitations of the study and referencing the dosing used i.e. single sc dose of 100 μg/kg 
body weight (BW) of lipegfilgrastim using the most appropriate presentation.   
Following circulation of the preliminary assessment report, comments from MS1 were received that 
questioned the need for an update to the SmPC for Lonquex prefilled syringe. They are of the opinion 
that “the outcome of this article 46 procedure should be EMA actively requesting the MAH to submit for 
variation of the MA in terms of an extension of the currently authorized product with for paediatric 
population suitable dosage form”. These comments have been addressed and incorporated within the 
assessment report and the request for additional clarification (changes are within highlighted text). 
Final consideration on SmPC updates will depend upon the clarification provided by the MAH. 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should provide description of the additional clarifications 
requested as part of this procedure. (see section “Additional clarification requested”) 
4.  Additional clarification requested 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this 
procedure: 
1)  The MAH is asked to clarify their strategy with regards an application for a paediatric indication 
for lipegfilgrastim (i.e. sections 4.1 and 4.2) with the totality of all paediatric evidence and in 
an age appropriate formulation meeting dosing recommendation throughout the paediatric age 
groups (i.e vial and/or prefilled syringe). 
MAH Response  
The  marketing  authorization  holder  (MAH)  confirms  that  children  weighing  60  kg  and  above  have 
received lipegfilgrastim at a dose of 6 mg in the 2 paediatric Studies XM22-07 and XM22-08. This 
is the adult fixed dose that can be delivered with the pre-filled syringe of Lonquex. Therefore, the 
pre-filled syringe formulation is considered appropriate for paediatric patients weighing 60 kg and 
above. For children older than 2 years and weighing less than 60 kg, the dosing recommendation 
will  be  below  6  mg  and  therefore,  the  appropriate  formulation  for  this  paediatric  group  is  the 
presentation in vials. For children less than 2 years of age, the MAH was waiting for the conclusion 
of Study XM22-08 to perform the extrapolation study, which concluded on 28 January 2019.  The 
MAH will need to evaluate the consolidated data of both paediatric studies (XM22-07 and XM22-08) 
and  the  extrapolation  study  to  have  a  final  definition  of  the  dosing  recommendation  for  the 
paediatric  group  of  children  weighing  below  60  kg.  In  addition,  the  MAH  has  completed  the 
development  of  the  vials  for  use  in  the  paediatric  clinical  trials  but  is  concluding  the  process 
development of the commercial batches at the final manufacturing site. 
According  to  the  above,  and  in  order  not  to  delay  the  availability  of  lipegfilgrastim  for  the 
paediatric population weighing 60 kg and above, the MAH strategy is as follows: 
•  Apply for the indication in the paediatric group of children weighing 60 kg and above in the 
pre-filled  syringes  together  with  the  update  of  Sections  4.8  and  5.1  of  the  summary  of 
product characteristics (SmPC).

•  Apply  for  the  indication  in  the  remaining  paediatric  group  once  evaluation  of  the 
consolidated  clinical  data  and  development  of  the  commercial  batches  of  vials  are 
concluded. 
Rapporteur’s comments: 
The overall strategy explained by the MAH is acceptable. The MAH will apply for an indication in 
the  paediatric  group  for  children  weighing  60kg  and  above  using  the  pre-filled  syringe.  The 
MAH’s  plan  to  apply  for  an  indication  in  the  remaining  weight  group  when  the  remainder  of 
clinical data are available, and development of commercial batches is completed is acceptable.

The  ‘separate  population  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  and  PK/pharmacodynamics  (PD)  report

paediatric  population  <2  years  of  age  (Study  4  of  the  paediatric  investigational  plan).  The 
objective of this report was to extend the semi-mechanistic PK/PD model in paediatric oncology 
patients  using  the  pooled  data  from  clinical  Studies  XM22-07  and  XM22-08.  The  final  PK/PD 
model,  together  with  weight  and  age  extrapolation  based  on  literature  information  about  PK 
and  PD  parameters,  would  allow  assessment  of the  possible dosing  strategies  for  children  <2 
years of age. The PK/PD report was concluded on 28 January 2019.  
Rapporteur’s comments 
The  MAH  has  clarified  the  nature  of  this  report  and  the  issue  is  resolved.  This  report  will  be 
part  of  the  data  used  to  allow  assessment  of  possible  dosing  strategies  for  the  under  2-year 
age group.   
3)  The MAH is asked to clarify if they consider that any of the AE, SAE, TEAE or treatment related 
TEAE are paediatric specific and which, if any, are regarded as new events for lipegfilgrastim. 
The MAH is also ask to specifically respond to the Rapporteur’s comments in page 24-26 of this 
report (comments are highlighted in italics).  
MAH response 
The MAH has provided a comprehensive reply to this question. A summary has been included 
below:  
Because of the complex study design and the strong association between CTX toxicity and the 
reported adverse events, an assessment of differences among the adverse events, treatment-
emergent adverse events, serious adverse events, and treatment-related treatment-emergent 
adverse events by treatment group and age cohort is difficult.  
As  a  result  of  the  study  design,  several  confounding  factors  were  introduced  that  adversely 
impacted  assessment  of  a  clear  and  direct  cause–effect  association  between  the  use  of 
filgrastim or lipegfilgrastim and the adverse reactions experienced by individual patients during 
study participation.  
The following are specific comments noted by the Rapporteur in the MAH response:  
•  Monocytosis  was  not  regarded  as  a  new  finding  for either  filgrastim or  lipegfilgrastim, 
nor was the condition specific to the paediatric population.  
•  Overall,  the  adverse  events  reported  among  patients  in  Study  XM22-08  were  either 
expected  according  to  the  known  adverse  drug  reaction  profiles  of  the  concomitant 
CTX, or were reactions included in the current safety profile of lipegfilgrastim in adults. 
There  was  no  new  information  provided  that  indicated  an  association  with  the 
paediatric condition alone.

From the data reviewed, the difference in grading between the patients who had grade 
1  leucocytosis  and  an  elevated  monocyte/leukocyte  ratio,  and  the  patient  who 
developed  grade  2  leucocytosis  appeared  to  be  associated  with  the  additional 
symptoms  experienced  by  the  patient  reported  with  grade  2  leucocytosis.  These 
symptoms were considered most likely to be associated with the patients CTX regimen. 
In  addition,  leucocytosis  is  a  known  adverse  reaction  reported  among  adult  patients 
treated  with  lipegfilgrastim.  There  were  no  data  among  the  reviewed  reports  of 
leucocytosis  that  suggested  a  difference  in  the  adverse  event  experience  between 
paediatric patients and lipegfilgrastim-treated adults.  
In  a  patient  who  had  splenomegaly,  it  was  considered  that  there  was  a  temporal 
association  between  the  administration  of  lipegfilgrastim  and  the  development  of 
splenomegaly  in  this  patient.  Splenomegaly  is  a  known  adverse  reaction  of 
lipegfilgrastim  in  adults;  however,  its  occurrence  in  this  patient  did  not  indicate  a 
difference  in  the  adverse  event  experience  between  paediatric  patients  and 
lipegfilgrastim-treated adults. 
In a patient with back pain, the more plausible explanation for this patient’s back pain 
was the association with CTX and its complications; however, the temporal association 
with  lipegfilgrastim  treatment  does  not  entirely  exclude  a  contributory  role. 
Musculoskeletal pains such as bone pain and myalgia are known adverse reactions for 
lipegfilgrastim.  There  was  nothing  found  among  the  events  developed  by  this  patient 
that indicated a difference in the adverse event experience between paediatric patients 
and lipegfilgrastim-treated adults. 
•  Headache was reported among adult patients treated with lipegfilgrastim. The temporal 
association with lipegfilgrastim as well as with CTX and its complications is a plausible 
explanation  for  the  headache  that  developed  in  one  patient.  The  occurrence  of  this 
condition  did  not  indicate  a  difference  in  the  adverse  event  experience  between 
paediatric patients and lipegfilgrastim-treated adults.  
• 
• 
Potentially  significant  chemistry  values  involved  elevations  in  ALT,  AST,  and  GGT  in 
patients treated with lipegfilgrastim; and elevations in bilirubin in patients treated with 
filgrastim. These events could be attributed to the use of CTX. 
Potentially  significant  haematology  parameters  involved  decreases  in  haematocrit, 
haemoglobin,  white  blood  cells,  and  platelets  that  were  observed  in  both  treatment 
groups. These events could be attributed to the use of CTX. 
Discussion by MAH: 
• 
There were no notable differences between the treatment groups in adverse events 
occurring in >5% of patients. 
• 
There was a strong confounding influence of CTX on both treatment groups, as the 
reported adverse events were also observed among patients receiving CTX without 
G-CSF treatment. 
• 
The incidence of treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events was similar 
between treatment groups, and the majority of the events were within the current 
lipegfilgrastim safety profile. 
• 
Potentially significant chemistry and hematologic parameters that were observed 
were also confounded by the effects of CTX. 
• 
• 
There was no evidence of new malignancies in either treatment groups. 
 No evidence was apparent of an increase in non-disease progression mortality in 
either treatment groups. 
There was no identified adverse safety signal involving immunogenicity. 
• 
•  No new or emerging safety concerns were detected after review of the information 
provided. 
Overall Conclusions by MAH: 
It is concluded after review of the adverse event information from Study XM22-08 that the 
safety profile of the paediatric patients who received lipegfilgrastim or filgrastim is comparable

to the safety profile of adult patients treated with lipegfilgrastim or filgrastim. 
Rapporteur’s comments: 
The MAH has supplied a comprehensive answer and clarification regarding the questions in AR.  
The MAH recognises the limitations of the study design and confounding factors and therefore 
‘the  difficulty of  assessment  of  a  clear  and  direct  cause–effect  association  between  the  use  of 
filgrastim or lipegfilgrastim and the adverse reactions experienced by individual patients during 
study participation’.  
The MAH, however, concludes that the safety profile from study XM22-08 in paediatric patients 
who  received  lipegfilgrastim  is  comparable  to  the  safety  profile  of  adults  receiving 
lipegfilgrastim.  
The responses of the MAH are acceptable.  
4)  The  MAH  is  asked  to  comment  on  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  immunogenicity  results  and 
relate them to existing knowledge of lipegfilgrastim in children. 
MAH Response  
The  only  available  data  on  the  immunogenicity  of  lipegfilgrastim  in  children  is  from  the  2 
paediatric clinical studies: XM22-07 and XM22-08. A single patient in each study developed an 
immunogenicity  response  during  the  study  conduct.  No  clinically  relevant  effect  on 
efficacy,safety,  and  tolerability  was  detected  for  either  patient  who  had  developed  a  positive 
anti-drug  antibody  (ADA)  response  during  the  study  or  follow-up  phase.  In  Study  XM22-07, 
immunogenicity was assessed in all patients (n = 21) for up to 1 year after administration of a 
single dose of 100 μg/kg BW lipegfilgrastim. A single patient with an ADA negative sample at 
baseline  developed  a  treatment  related  ADA  response.  This  patient  with  rhabdomyosarcoma 
had  an  ADA  negative  sample  at  the  EOS  visit  (approximately  3  months  after  the  1st  dose  of 
lipegfilgrastim)  but  was  ADA  positive  at  follow-up  day  180,  after  lipegfilgrastim  treatment 
ended,  and  after  receiving  several doses  of  commercial  filgrastim  during the  follow-up  phase. 
The  ADA  titer  of  the  day  180  sample  was  very  low  (<1),  and  the  ADA  bound  to  the  cytidine 
monophosphate-sialic  acid-polyethylene  glycol  (cPEG)  moiety  of  XM22,  but  not  to  the  G-CSF 
moiety  of  XM22,  nor  to  the  native  G-CSF.  Moreover,  the  ADA  positive  sample  of  this  patient 
was not neutralizing. This patient had severe neutropenia for the duration of 1 day (study day 
7) but no very severe neutropenia, and no febrile neutropenia. The patient reported no serious 
adverse event, and no immunogenicity-related adverse event. 
In Study XM22-08, immunogenicity was assessed in all patients in the lipegfilgrastim group (n 
= 21) for up to 1 year after administration of lipegfilgrastim (a single dose of 100 μg/kg BW 
once per cycle for 4 cycles). 
A  single  patient    with  an  ADA  negative  sample  at  baseline  had  positive  post-baseline  ADA 
samples. Samples from this patient with rhabdomyosarcoma were positive at cycle 2 CTX day 
1,  and  at  the  EOS  visit  (study  day  91)  while  follow-up  samples  at  day  180,  and  at  day  365 
were ADA negative. The ADA titer of the cycle 2 sample was low (<1), and the ADA bound to 
the cytidine monophosphate-sialic acid-polyethylene glycol (cPEG) moiety of XM22, but not to 
the G-CSF moiety of XM22, nor to the native G-CSF. In the sample collected at the EOS visit, 
no antibody titer could be measured (0.0) due to a very low ADA concentration.  In both ADA 
positive  samples  no  neutralizing  antibodies  were  detected.  Therefore,  the  ADA  response 
observed was considered as very low. The duration of severe neutropenia for this patient was 1 
day in cycle 1, and 3 days in cycle 2; and no severe neutropenia was reported in cycles 3 and 
4.  The  patient  did  not  have  febrile  neutropenia  in  any  cycle.  There  were  no  injection  site 
reactions  at  any  study  drug  administration.  This  patient  reported  no  serious  adverse  event of 
thrombocytopenia, and no immunogenicity-related adverse event. 
Rapporteur’s comments  
The MAH’s response to the question is acceptable and the issue is considered resolved.

An  update  to  the  SmPC  is  recommended  when  any  new  and  relevant  information 
becomes available. This allows clinicians to be informed about new studies regarding 
lipegfilgrastim  without  supporting  off  label,  unlicensed  use  or  endangering  the 
paediatric development plan. The efficacy and safety data presented in Study XM22-
08, therefore, warrants an update to the SmPC. The MAH is asked to provide wording 
to  update  sections  4.8  and  5.1  of  the  SmPC  for  consideration  for  inclusion  in  the 
SmPC,  reflecting  the  limitations  of  the  study  and  referencing  the  dosing  used  i.e. 
single  sc  dose  of  100  μg/kg  body  weight  (BW)  of  lipegfilgrastim  using  the  most 
appropriate presentation. 
MAH Response: 
The  MAH  has  reviewed  the  safety  data  from  Study  XM22-08;  no  new/paediatric-specific 
adverse  events,  serious  adverse  events,  treatment-emergent  adverse  events,  or  treatment-
related  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  were  identified  among  the  study  patients.  A 
comprehensive  summary  of  the  lipegfilgrastim  safety  profile  from  Study  XM22-08  has  been 
prepared in response to the safety-related questions from the Agency and is presented under 
Question 3. The events that were reported are expected based on the known safety profile of 
lipegfilgrastim,  or  are  expected  based  on  the  known  safety  profile  of  the  various 
family  of  tumours  or 
chemotherapeutic  agents  prescribed 
rhabdomyosarcoma.  Therefore,  the  MAH  considers  that  in  “Section  4.8  Undesirable  effects” 
of the SmPC, only the subchapter of “Paediatric population” needs to be updated. In regard 
to this, the MAH proposes the following text in bold will be included and the strikethrough text 
will be deleted from “Section 4.8 Undesirable effects” of the SmPC. 
for  patients  with  Ewing 
Section 4.8 Undesirable effects 
Paediatric population 
The MAH proposes the following: 
The experience in children is limited to a single-dose phase 1 study in 21 based on 2 studies 
in  a  total  of  63  paediatric  patients  aged  2  to  <18  years  (see  section  5.1),  which  did  not 
indicate  a  difference  in  the  safety  profile  of  lipegfilgrastim  in  children  compared  to  that  in 
adults. Treatment-related adverse events were back pain, bone pain and increased neutrophil 
count (1 event each). 
Rapporteur’s comments:  
The MAH response to update section 4.8 of the SmPC is welcomed.   
As recommended by the Agency, the MAH agrees to update the wording in Section 5.1 of the 
SmPC  with  the  new  and  relevant  information  from  Study  XM22-08.The  MAH  changes  are  as 
follows: text in bold will be included and the strikethrough text will be deleted in“Section 5.1 
Pharmacodynamic properties” of the SmPC: 
The  Rapporteur,  however,  recommends  changes  to  the  MAH  proposal  for  updates  to    Section 
5.1  where  Rapporteur’s  additions  to  the  text  are  italicised  underlined  and  deletions  are 
strikethrough text.  
Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties 
Paediatric population 
The  European  Medicines  Agency  has  deferred  the  obligation  to  submit  the  results  of  studies 
with  Lonquex  in  all  subsets  of  the  paediatric  population  in  the  treatment  of  chemotherapy-
induced neutropenia and prevention of chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia (see section 
4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
Two  clinical  studies  (XM22-07  and  XM22-08)  were  conducted 
in  paediatric 
populations  using  LONQUEX  (lipegfilgrastim)  for  the  treatment  of  chemotherapy-
induced  neutropenia  and 
febrile 
neutropenia. In both studies, lipegfilgrastim was supplied in glass vials containing 10 
mg of lipegfilgrastim in a 1 ml solution for subcutaneous injection. 
the  prevention  of  chemotherapy-induced 
In a the phase 1 study (Study XM22-07) of 21 children aged between 2 and 16 years  with 
Ewing family of tumours or rhabdomyosarcoma, received lipegfilgrastim was administered as a 
single subcutaneous dose of 100 μg/kg (up to a maximum of 6 mg, which is the fixed dose for

adults) 24 hours after the end of the last chemotherapy treatment in week 1 of the regimen. 
The  incidence  of  FN  varied  according  to  age  (from  14.3%  to  71.4%),  with  the  highest 
frequency  in  the  oldest  age  group.  The  use  of  three  different  chemotherapy  regimens,  with 
varying myelosuppressive effects and age distributions, complicated the comparison of efficacy 
across  age  groups.  See  section  4.2.  Treatment-related  adverse  events  were  back  pain,  bone 
pain and increased neutrophil count (1 event each). 
In the phase 2 study (Study XM22-08) of 42 children aged between 2 and <18 years 
with  Ewing  family  of  tumours  or  rhabdomyosarcoma,  patients  received  for  4 
consecutive chemotherapy cycles in a 1:1 ratio either lipegfilgrastim at a dose of 100
μg/kg  (up  to  a  maximum  of  6  mg,  which  is  the  fixed  dose  for  adults;  1  dose  per 
cycle) or filgrastim at a dose of 5 μg/kg (once daily for at least 5 consecutive days 
per cycle [maximum  of 14  days]). The primary endpoint  was the  duration  of severe 
neutropenia  (DSN)  in  cycle  1.  DSN  (mean  [standard  deviation])  in  cycle  1  was  2.7 
(2.25)  days  in  the  lipegfilgrastim  group  and  2.5  (2.09)  days  in  the  filgrastim  group 
(Per  Protocol  [PP]  Analysis  set).  The  overall  incidence  of  febrile  neutropenia  was 
35% in the lipegfilgrastim group and 42% in the filgrastim group (PP Analysis Set). 
A major limitation of this study was that no formal hypothesis testing was performed 
as the study was not powered for it.; conclusions were limited to providing estimates 
of the means for the treatments and their differences. Other limitations included the 
heterogeneity of the study population (in terms of the underlying cancer being Ewing 
family  of  tumours  or  rhabdomyosarcoma),  the  allowed  use  of  5  different 
chemotherapy  regimens  in  the  study,  and  the  limited  number  of  patients  in  the 
different  age  cohorts.  Therefore,  results  from  this  study  should  be  interpreted  with 
caution. 
Rapporteur’s comments: 
The  MAH  has  provided  wording  to  update  sections  4.8  and  5.1  of  the  SmPC.  We  have 
suggested  changes  to  the  MAH  proposal  for  the  wording  of  section  5.1.  Notwithstanding  the 
limitations  of  study  XM22-08  and  the  need  to  interpret  these  data  with  caution,  updating 
sections  4.8  and  5.1  is  considered  essential  to  inform  clinicians  of  the  most  current  data  for 
lipegfilgrastim in the paediatric population.   
Rapporteur’s Final Conclusion and Recommendation  
 Fulfilled: 
The MAH is requested to submit a type II variation for a paediatric indication for lipegfilgrastim 
with the totality of all paediatric evidence together with the proposal of updates to sections 4.8 
and 5.1 of the SmPC and PIL, no later than 60 days after the receipt of these 
conclusions, in accordance with Articles 16 and 17 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 or provide 
a justification for not doing so.

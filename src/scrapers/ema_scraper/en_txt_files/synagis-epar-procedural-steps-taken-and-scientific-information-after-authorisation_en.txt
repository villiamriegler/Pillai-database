As a result of this variation, the following text now appears 
in order to update safety information based on 
results from safety data evaluations from multiple 
sources, including the clinical Study W00-350, post-
Marketing Clinical Surveillance Programme (REACH), 
literature searches and the AstraZeneca Global

“In an open label prospective trial pharmacokinetics and 
immunogenicity were evaluated after administration of 6 
doses of palivizumab within a single RSV season. The 
pharmacokinetic data indicated that adequate mean 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

whom data on 30 day through serum concentrations after 
the sixth dose were available (see section 5.2). No 
significant elevations of anti-palivizumab antibody titer 
were observed in these 14 participants.  Transient, low 
levels of anti palivizumab antibody were observed in one 
child after the second dose of palivizumab that dropped to 
undetectable levels at the fifth and seventh dose.” 
Additionally, the following new text was included in section 
5.2:  
“In the open label prospective trial evaluating 
pharmacokinetics with administration of 6 monthly 
intramuscular doses of 15 mg/kg of palivizumab, mean 30 
day trough serum concentrations were approximately 40 
g/ml after the first dose, 120 g/ml after the fourth 
dose, and 140 g/ml after the sixth dose.” 
The following sentence was added to Section 4.8: “In a 
small open label prospective trial of 14 subjects, who 
received 6 doses, the adverse events reported were 
consistent with the known safety profile of palivizumab.”

Palivizumab exhibited median EC50 values of 0.65 g/ml 
and 0.28 g/ml against clinical RSV A and RSV B isolates, 
respectively. 
In a genotypic analysis of 126 clinical isolates from 123 
children who failed immunoprophylaxis, all RSV mutants 
that exhibited resistance to palivizumab (n=8) were shown 
to contain amino acid changes in this region of the F 
protein. At least one of the palivizumab resistance-
associated substitutions, N262D, K272E/Q, or S275F/L was 
identified in these 8 clinical RSV isolates, resulting in a 
combined resistance-associated mutation frequency of 
6.3% in these patients.  Analysis of 254 clinical RSV 
isolates collected from immunoprophylaxis-naïve subjects 
revealed palivizumab resistance-associated substitutions in

SmPC and 
A comparison of 19 commercially available diagnostic tests 
a risk of false-negative results in diagnostic tests for 
Annex II 
for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) demonstrated that 
RSV in palivizumab-treated patients. The MAH has 
also updated the section on human anti-human 
antibody responses in section 4.8 based on a review 
of the available immunogenicity data. Furthermore, 
Annex II was brought in line with the latest QRD 
template version 8.3. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
palivizumab can interfere with certain assays, which could 
lead to false-negative results. Information on the types of 
tests affected or not affected was therefore added to 
section 4.5. Due to its limited relevance for the disease 
diagnostics and clinical management of patients, no further 
actions were deemed necessary.  
In addition, the immunogenicity data from five large 
multicentre clinical trials were reviewed and it was 
concluded that the anti-palivizumab antibody response is 
infrequent, transient and of low titre, and that no clinical 
safety effect seems to be associated with the presence of 
anti-palivizumab antibodies. These observations are in line 
with the information present in the SmPC section 4.8; 
however the wording was updated to reflect all currently 
available data.

In addition, sections 4.2, 6.6 of the SmPC have been

additional instructions regarding the overfill. Annexes

been updated accordingly. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications

administration. The MAH performed the search from 3 
perspectives: published literature, clinical reports (including 
the development program and Phase 4 studies), and 
spontaneous post-marketing reports. On the basis of this 
analysis, information related to anaphylactic shock and the 
rare potential for fatal outcome has been added to the 
product information.

with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease 
(HSCHD) was granted based on study MI-CP048 
(EMEA/H/C/257/II/13). At the time of approval, the MAH 
committed to perform a post marketing study (M03-681) to 
further assess the rates of serious infection, serious 
arrhythmia, and death associated with palivizumab 
prophylaxis in children with HSCHD. The final study report 
for study M03-681 was evaluated by the CHMP as part of 
FU2 17.6. The CHMP concluded that the results of this 
study indicate no increased risk of serious infections, 
serious arrhythmias, or death associated with palivizumab 
compared with matched untreated controls in young 
children with HSCHD. The benefit/risk profile for 
palivizumab for the prophylaxis of serious RSV infection 
requiring hospitalization remains favourable for young 
children with HSCHD. As requested by the CHMP, the MAH 
updated section 5.1 of the SmPC with information on this 
paediatric study.

SmPC and PL 
A cumulative review including reports of thrombocytopenia 
about thrombocytopenia and convulsion as potential 
undesirable effects of palivizumab therapy following 
assessment of PSUR 10. The MAH also takes the 
opportunity to make corrections to section 4.8 in the 
SPC regarding the frequency of apnoea, anaphylaxis, 
and urticaria. The PL was updated accordingly. 
In addition, section 4.9 was has been further 
and convulsion coincident with palivizumab received from 
19th June 1998 through 31st October 2008 was performed. 
There are 5 reports of decreased platelet count or 
thrombocytopenia with no apparent alternate etiology. 
Although a direct causal relationship between palivizumab 
and thrombocytopenia cannot be proven, a temporal 
relationship cannot be excluded. There are 19 reports of

non-febrile convulsions with no apparent alternative 
etiology for the event. These reports include reports from 
both premature infants and those with CHD. In 13 of these 
reports, the convulsion occurred within 24 hours of the 
palivizumab dose, and in 4 of these 13 reports, there was a 
positive rechallenge. There were 16 reports of convulsions 
associated with fever. In 8 reports, a cause for the fever 
was listed or could be deduced from the narrative. In the 
other 8 reports, there was no cause for the fever apart 
from the palivizumab therapy. The reports with no 
apparent alternate etiology described patients who may 
have had concurrent immunizations, or intercurrent 
illnesses, but none of these factors were reported. Although 
a causal relationship between palivizumab therapy and 
convulsions cannot be proven, there appears to be a 
temporal relationship between the two. Based on the 
analysis of these reports, section 4.8 of the SPC is updated 
to include thrombocytopenia and convulsions as potential 
undesirable effects of palivizumab. 
An additional correction was made to the Post-marketing 
section of the Synagis SPC regarding events of apnoea, 
anaphylaxis, and urticaria. 
Section 4.9 of the SPC has been further enhanced with a 
statement that overdoses as high as 60 mg/kg have been 
reported without untoward medical events.

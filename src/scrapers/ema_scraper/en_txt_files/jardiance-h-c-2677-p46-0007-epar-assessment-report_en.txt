1.  Introduction 
On 22 July 2016, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study and a population PK-PD study for 
Jardiance (Empagliflozin), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measure PIP (P/2011/2015). 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that studies 1245.87 and er-uge-t2dm-pediatrics are part of a paediatric clinical 
development program. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
For the paediatric study 1245.87, 5 mg, 10 mg and 25 mg empagliflozin tablets originally developed 
for adult patients were used. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic and a population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis 
(exposure-response) was performed to characterise and compare the relationship between 
empagliflozin plasma exposure and 24 h urinary glucose excretion following a single dose of 
empagliflozin in adult and paediatric patients. 
The MAH submitted study reports for: 
• 
Study 1245.87: An open-label, randomised, multicentre, single-dose, parallel group trial to 
evaluate pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of empagliflozin in children and 
adolescents from 10 to less than 18 years of age with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
• 
er-uge-t2dm-pediatrics: Population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis to characterise 
the exposure-response relationship for the effect of empagliflozin on 24 h urinary 
glucose excretion in adults, children and adolescent type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. 
For adult patients two dose strengths of Empgliflozin are approved, Jardiance 10 mg and 25 mg film-
coated tablets. During clinical development a dose rage of 0.5 mg to 800 mg empagliflozin has been 
evaluated in clinical studies. 
Empagliflozin is a reversible, highly potent and selective competitive inhibitor of sodium-glucose co-
transporter 2 (SGLT2) which is highly expressed in the kidney. SGLT2 is responsible for the 
reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate back into the circulation. In patients with type 2 
diabetes and hyperglycaemia a higher amount of glucose is filtered and reabsorbed. Empagliflozin 
improves glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes by reducing renal glucose reabsorption. 
The amount of glucose removed by the kidney through this glucuretic mechanism is dependent on 
blood glucose concentration and GFR. A dose-dependent increase in urinary glucose excretion (UGE) 
was observed with a near maximal effect for the 10mg and 25mg dose.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

The pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin have been extensively characterised in healthy volunteers and 
patients with type 2 diabetes. After oral administration, empagliflozin was rapidly absorbed with peak 
plasma concentrations occurring at a median tmax of 1.5 hours post-dose. Thereafter, plasma 
concentrations declined in a biphasic manner with a rapid distribution phase and a relatively slow 
terminal phase with a apparent terminal elimination half-life of 12.4 hours. The steady state mean 
plasma AUC and Cmax were 1870 nmol.h/l and 259 nmol/l with empagliflozin 10 mg and 4740 
nmol.h/l and 687 nmol/l with empagliflozin 25 mg once daily. Empagliflozin displays approximately 
linear pharmacokinetics up to a dose of 400mg. 
2.3.2.  Clinical studies 
Study 1245.87 
Description 
PK/PD study 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The primary objective of trial 1245.87 was to assess the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of 5 mg, 10 
mg, or 25 mg empagliflozin in paediatric patients with T2DM. The secondary objective of this study 
was to investigate the pharmacodynamics of a single dose of empagliflozin in the same population. 
Safety of empagliflozin in paediatric patients was also assessed in this trial. 
Study design 
This was a randomised, single-dose, parallel group trial with 3 treatment arms with 1 dose of 
empagliflozin each (5 mg, 10 mg, and 25 mg). Randomisation was stratified so that 1 third to 2 thirds 
of the patients were female and at least 6 participants were younger than 15 years of age. 
Study population /Sample size 
Patients with T2DM who were in the age range of 10 to less than 18 years and who had insufficient 
glycaemic control (HbA1c of ≤10.5%) despite treatment with diet and exercise and/or stable 
metformin and/or stable basal or multiple dose injection (MDI) insulin therapy were included in this 
trial. A total of 27 patients were randomised to 1 of the 3 treatment groups (9 patients to the 5 mg 
dose group, 8 patients to the 10 mg dose group, and 10 patients to the 25 mg dose group) and 
completed the trial as planned. No important protocol violations were identified, and no patient was 
excluded from any of the patient analysis sets.

Outcomes/endpoints 
The following pharmacokinetic parameters of empagliflozin were analysed as primary endpoints: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
AUC0-∞ (area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity) 
AUC0-tz (area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the time of the last 
quantifiable concentration) 
Cmax (maximum observed plasma concentration) 
tmax (time from dosing until maximum observed concentration is reached in plasma) 
t1/2 (terminal half-life in plasma) 
The following pharmacodynamic parameters were analysed as secondary endpoints: 
• 
• 
• 
Change from baseline in urinary glucose excretion (UGE) over 24 h after study drug intake 
Change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 24 h after study drug intake 
Change from baseline in 8-point plasma glucose profile over 24 h after study drug intake (as 
defined by change from baseline in mean daily glucose (MDG)) 
Safety was determined based on monitoring of adverse events (including adverse events of special 
interest (AESIs) as well as clinically relevant findings from the physical examination and the 12-lead 
electrocardiogram (ECG)), recording vital signs, and conducting safety laboratory measurements 
(haematology, clinical chemistry, lipids, and urinalysis including electrolytes and acido-base 
equilibrium). 
Sample collection 
For quantification of empagliflozin plasma concentrations, EDTA-anticoagulated blood samples were 
collected at -0.5 (predose) and 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, 12, 24, 34 and 48 hours post dose. 
Urine samples were collected for the following intervals: -24 h to 0 h (predose), 0h to 5h, 5 h to 12h, 
12 h to 24 h, 24 h to 48 h post dose. Urine collection from before trial drug administration served as 
the baseline measurement. Patients should preferably empty their bladder at the end of each sampling 
interval. The urine was to be pooled with all the urine collected during the respective sampling interval. 
As urine of all sampling intervals was needed for both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (UGE) 
purposes, the urine was collected in the same containers for both.  
MDG at baseline and on Day 1 were calculated based on the 8-point plasma profiles of Day -1 and Day 
1, respectively. Plasma glucose was measured at the following times:

Plasma and urine concentrations of empagliflozin were determined using a validated high performance 
liquid chromatography, tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) assay. The analyses were 
performed at BASi (Bioanalytical Systems Inc.), West Lafayette, USA. Empagliflozin in human plasma 
and urine have previously been validated at BASi (Respectively SAP.1217 and SAP.1216). 
All endpoints (pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety) were analysed using descriptive 
statistics. Dose proportionality of empagliflozin was explored using a regression model on the double-
log scale. A 95% confidence interval (CI) for the slope was computed. For the changes from baseline in 
UGE, adjusted means per treatment group were calculated based on an analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) including ‘treatment’ as a fixed effect and ‘UGE at baseline’ and ‘FPG at baseline’ as 
continuous covariates. For the changes from baseline in MDG and FPG, adjusted means per treatment 
group were calculated based on an ANCOVA including ‘treatment’ as fixed effect and ‘MDG at baseline’ 
or ‘FPG at baseline’, respectively, as continuous covariate. 
SAS® version 9.4 was used for all statistical analyses. Non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analyses 
were performed using WinNonlinTM software (professional Network version6.3, Pharsight Corporation, 
Mountain View, USA). 
Population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis (er-uge-t2dm-pediatrics) 
The following modelling steps were performed: 
• Development of a exposure-response model in adult patients with T2DM to characterize the effect of 
a single dose of empagliflozin on 24 h UGE 
• Comparison of the UGE exposure-response in adult and paediatric patients with T2DM by clinical trial 
simulations 
• Development of an exposure-response model to characterize the effect of a single dose of 
empagliflozin on 24 h UGE in paediatric patients with T2DM.

The adult dataset comprised data from 3 clinical studies with a total number of 226 adult patients with 
T2DM. Each patient contributed two 24 h UGE measurements: one at baseline and one on the first day 
of drug administration. The patients received either placebo (49 patients), 1 mg (19 patients), 2.5 mg 
(9 patients), 5 mg (21 patient), 10 mg (45 patients), 25 mg (44 patients) or 100 mg (39 patients) of 
empagliflozin, with exposures ranging from 163.4 nmol·h/L in the 1 mg dose group to 27660 nmol·h/L 
in the 100 mg dose group. Of the 226 total patients, 190 were male and 36 were female, 123 were 
White, 101 were Asian , and two were Black patients. The median eGFR was 96.2 ml/min/1.73 m2, 
median baseline MDG was 186 mg/dL, median age was 58.0 years (37.6 to 69.0 years) and median 
body weight was 82.3 kg (50.0 to 120 kg). The median baseline UGE was slightly lower in study 
1245.4 (0.67 g/d) compared to the median baseline UGE in study 1245.2 (4.08 g/d) and study 
1245.15 (6.81 g/d).  
The main differences between the adult studies were that study 1245.15 was a study in Japanese 
subjects while the other two studies were conducted in Caucasian populations. Further the PK sampling 
schemes were not identical and oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) and meal tolerance tests (MTT) 
were conducted at different moments during the studies. Also the study duration varied between 
studies, but this is considered irrelevant for model development as only predose data and data of the 
first day have been used in the model. 
The demographics of the paediatric population is described in Table 1. Paediatric subjects had a higher 
eGFR (165.8 ml/min/1.73 m2), a higher median bodyweight (96.7 kg) and in the paediatric study no 
OGTT was conducted. 
Methods 
The population analysis was performed using non-linear mixed-effects modelling techniques 
implemented in the software NONMEM, combined with graphical visualization methods. 
Investigation of pre-selected covariate effects on maximal effect, Emax, estimated baseline UGE, and 
AUC50 (area under the curve resulting in 50% of Emax) was undertaken following a stepwise covariate 
model-building (SCM) procedure. During SCM for the joint (adult and paediatric) population a special 
focus was laid on potential differences between the two populations.

The predictive performance of best current models for the adult and joint population was evaluated by 
basic goodness of fit plots and visual predictive checks. Simulations based on the best current model 
for adult patients with T2DM and the joint population were performed to examine the impact of 
covariates identified as statistically significant during the analysis on the pharmacodynamics of 
empagliflozin. 
The best current model based on adult data was used to simulate the exposure-response profile of a 
typical adult patient which was compared to observed change from baseline in 24 h UGE in the 
respective dose groups of the paediatric trial. Moreover, simulations were performed to assess the 
absolute change from baseline (and % from maximal effect) in 24 h UGE for a typical adult and typical 
paediatric patient with T2DM. 
Criteria for Model Evaluation: 
The key and final models were evaluated with regard to the minimization process, the covariance 
matrix of the parameter estimates and basic goodness of fit plots.  
Goodness of fit plots have been presented for: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Conditional and individually weighted residuals versus time, observation, and population or 
individual predicted value: Data should be evenly distributed around the zero reference line 
Observed versus population predicted and individual predicted values: Data should be evenly 
distributed around the line of identity 
Histograms of the random effects (post hoc estimates of individual realizations and residuals) 
Assessment of shrinkage in the random effects. 
Additionally, visual predictive checks (VPC) for each randomization group in each study have been 
performed to assess the predictive performance of the model. 
Covariate analysis: 
The following covariates have been evaluated: 
• 
FPG or HbA1c or MDG as a measure of glycaemic control 
•  eGFR as the measure of renal function 
•  Demographics (age, weight, sex, Caucasian/Asian/Black race) 
•  Metformin background medication 
Assumptions: 
The company made several assumptions during model development. 
It was assumed that the performance of oral glucose tolerance test and deviating plasma glucose 
measurements do not impact MDG and UGE. To test this assumption a sensitivity analysis has been 
performed to compare MDG and UGE on days with OGTT and without OGTT in raw data.  
This sensitivity analysis shows that oral glucose tolerance tests do not have a major impact on baseline 
MDG or UGE (figure 5).

Figure 1 Comparison of baseline MDG and baseline UGE for patients with oral 
glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and meal tolerance test (MTT) 
In study 1245.2 only a baseline day with OGTT was available, for 1245.4 and 1245.15 a baseline day with and without tolerance test were 
available. 
It was assumed that the exposure-response between adult and paediatric patients is comparable 
and/or can be scaled based on available covariates as maturation processes in kidney are completed 
by age of 2. This was tested by pooling the adult and paediatric data. The differences in model 
parameters between paediatric and adult patients have been evaluated by investigating patient 
population as covariate. 
It was assumed that dose-normalized AUCs can be used to scale exposure for different doses during 
simulations as dose-linear PK after single/multiple dose between 0.5 to 800/100 mg of empagliflozin 
has been established. The dose proportionality was previously tested in adult program and has been 
tested during statistical analysis of 1245.87 data.  
It is assumed that the same empagliflozin exposure results in the same 24 h UGE in adults and 
children as it is assumed that there are no differences in SGLT-2 expression and activity and renal 
function. The differences in model parameters between paediatric and adult patients were evaluated by 
investigating patient population as covariate or by comparing parameter estimates from separate 
(adult and paediatric) models. 
Discussion on the methodology 
The design of paediatric study 1245.87 and its analytical and statistical methods used for the 
evaluation of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Empagliflozin are acceptable. 
The methodology used in the Population PK-PD study er-uge-t2dm-pediatrics is considered 
appropriate, standard statistical an model building techniques were used. The company appropriately 
explained al model building steps, has verified the relevant covariates and justified and tested the 
assumptions of the model.  
The three studies in the adult model differed with regard to assessing mean daily glucose (1245.2 had 
a different glucose sampling scheme and an OGTT was performed) and the study population (1245.15 
was a trial in Asian patients including 101 patients). Both differences were explicitly tested for either

during the covariate analysis (Asian race) or during a sensitivity analysis (OGTT) based on the best 
current model for adult patients and did not show a significant influence on parameter estimation. 
The data from the paediatric trial (1245.87) differed from the adult dataset mostly in terms of baseline 
glycaemic control (e.g. median MDG), median body weight, renal function in terms of eGFR and 
distribution of race. Also, the glucose measurements, which were used to calculate the mean daily 
glucose, were conducted at different time points when compared to the adult trials. Despite difference 
in sampling frequency and number of samples as well as the performance on an OGTT, mean daily 
glucose was still the best descriptor for baseline UGE and Emax when comparing OFV, basic goodness 
of fit plots and VPCs of models with different measures of glycaemic control. With regard to explaining 
interindividual variability in baseline UGE, mean daily glucose performed better than the rest of the 
measures for glucose control in both, the adult and the joint population. Therefore baseline MDG has 
been included as a marker for glycaemic control in the final models (adult and joint population). 
Results 
Pharmacokinetics 
Following single dose administration, empagliflozin was rapidly absorbed in paediatric patients with 
T2DM, with a median tmax of approximately 1.5 h. After reaching peak concentrations, plasma levels 
declined biphasically. Empagliflozin exposure (both with respect to AUC and Cmax) increased with 
increasing dose. Mean t1/2 was 7 to 8 h for all dose groups. The primary pharmacokinetic parameters of 
empagliflozin in plasma are shown in Table 2 below for all three dose groups.

The pharmacokinetic exposure was generally comparable between paediatric and adult patients with 
T2DM (see table 3) 
Table 3 Comparison of pharmacokinetic parameters1 of empagliflozin in paediatric 
and adult patients with T2DM following single dose empagliflozin administration 
Pharmacodynamics 
A dose-dependent increase from baseline in urinary glucose excretion (UGE) in the 24 h following 
empagliflozin administration was observed, with mean changes from baseline (adjusted for baseline 
UGE) of 53.1 g/24 h in the 5 mg dose group, 73.0 g/24 h in the 10 mg dose group, and 87.4 g/24 h in 
the 25 mg dose group (table 4).  
In all three dose groups, this increase in UGE was accompanied by a decrease from baseline in FPG at 
24 h postdose. The mean change in FPG from baseline (adjusted for baseline FPG) was -15.5 mg/dL in 
the 5 mg dose group, -16.6 mg/dL in the 10 mg dose group, and -20.4 mg/dL in the 25 mg dose 
group at 24 h postdose (table 5). 
The mean baseline UGE and FPG were comparable between the 5mg and 10mg group but considerably 
lower in the 25mg group. 
Further the Mean daily glucose (MDG) levels were evaluated. The MDG analysis was based on the data 
of all patients with at least 7 out of 8 measurements evaluable per 8-point plasma glucose profile, 
taken within the required time windows. In addition two different sensitivity analysis were performed, 
one was including all patients with at least 6 out of 8 measurements and one excluded all patients on 
insulin background therapy. 
Mean baseline MDG differed between the 3 dose groups, with lowest values in the 25 mg group. For all 
3 dose groups, MDG was lower following single-dose empagliflozin administration compared with the 
baseline value The mean MDG change from baseline as well as the adjusted mean change from 
baseline in MDG are shown per treatment group in Table 6.

Safety 
Safety was monitored descriptively. For 7 out of 27 patients (25.9%), at least 1 adverse event was 
reported during the on treatment phase of the trial. This comprised 4 out of 9 patients (44.4%) in the 
5 mg dose group, 1 out of 8 patients (12.5%) in the 10 mg dose group, and 2 out of 10 patients 
(20.0%) in the 25 mg dose group. All adverse events were of mild or moderate intensity. No serious 
adverse events, no deaths, and no other ‘significant adverse event’ according to ICH E3 were reported 
for any of the patients. No patient discontinued the trial due to an adverse event. All 3 single doses of 
empagliflozin were well tolerated in this trial. The safety results of this trial were consistent with those 
observed in previous empagliflozin trials conducted in adults. 
No new safety signals were detected in paediatric patients who received empagliflozin.

Pharmacokinetic - pharmacodynamic evaluation 
The relationship between empagliflozin exposure and UGE was graphically explored. 
The individual UGE0-24 and UGE0-48 values versus the respective empagliflozin AUC0-24, and Cmax values 
for empagliflozin following single oral administration of 5 mg, 10 mg, and 25 mg empagliflozin have 
been presented by the company. A large variability of the data was observed, especially the UGE 
values in the 5 mg and 10 mg dose groups. No clear correlation between exposure and UGE was 
observed. 
In this report only the UGE (Ae0-24) versus AUC0-24 of empagliflozin is presented (figure 1).

Population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis.  
The base models characterizing the exposure-response for the adult and the joint (adult and 
paediatric) population were Emax models estimating baseline urinary glucose excretion (UGE), the 
maximal drug effect (Emax) and the AUC50 parameter (area under the curve which results in 50% of 
Emax). Interindividual variability was estimate for baseline UGE in both models and the residual 
variability was described by a combined (additive and proportional error model). Based on the base 
models covariate effects were investigated and simulations to characterize the exposure-response were 
carried out. 
Adult model 
Figure 2 shows the best current model based on the adult population, which comprised sex and 
baseline mean daily glucose (MDG) as covariates for baseline UGE and age and baseline MDG as 
covariates for Emax. For the dose range 5-25 mg empagliflozin, the relationship between empagliflozin 
exposure and glucose excretion is rather flat.

The influence of covariates on absolute change from baseline in 24 h UGE for a 25 mg dose of 
empagliflozin (q.d.) is shown in figure 3. The plot shows that change from baseline in UGE increases 
the younger the patient and increases with increasing baseline MDG compared to a reference patient 
(male, age: 58 years, baseline MDG: 185 mg/dL). Although having a statistically significant effect on 
baseline UGE, female sex showed only a minor influence on the overall drug effect compared to a male 
reference patient, with a slightly lower change from baseline in 24 h UGE ( 95% CI included the 
reference value).

Joint model  
The best current model based on the joint population comprised sex and baseline MDG as covariates 
for baseline UGE and baseline MDG, weight and Asian race as covariates for Emax. During covariate 
analysis no statistically significant influence of the study population (adult versus paediatric patients) 
was identified on the model parameters, i.e. the exposure-response between the two populations was 
comparable after accounting for the identified significant covariates.  
The influence of covariates on absolute change from baseline in 24 h UGE for a 25 mg dose of 
empagliflozin (q.d.) is shown in figure 6. The plot shows that change from baseline in 24 h UGE 
increases with increasing body weight and increasing baseline MDG compared to a reference patient 
(male, non-Asian, weight: 83 kg, baseline MDG: 182 mg/dL). Female sex only had a minor influence 
resulting in a slightly lower change from baseline in 24 h UGE with the 95% CI including the reference 
value. Asian patients showed a slightly higher change from baseline in 24 h UGE. It should be noted 
that the influence of this covariate is driven by the adult dataset as only one paediatric Asian patient 
was included in 1245.87.

Simulations based on the best current model for the joint population were carried out to characterize 
the effect of different doses of empagliflozin on change from baseline in 24 h UGE in the two 
populations (typical adult patient: male, non-Asian, body weight: 82 kg, baseline MDG: 186 mg/dL; 
typical paediatric patient: female, non-Asian, body weight: 92 kg, baseline MDG: 124 mg/dL) (table 
7). Overall the simulated change from baseline in 24 h UGE was in line with the observed change from 
baseline. The absolute change from baseline for a typical paediatric patient was predicted to be slightly 
lower compared to a typical adult patient. The exposure-response was comparable between the two 
populations (Table 8).

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Paediatric study 1245.87 
Demographic characteristic showed some differences between the treatment groups and were not 
unexpected due to the small sample size. The mean weight was higher in the 10 mg dose group with 
111.0 kg than in the 5 mg and 25 mg dose groups with 90.0 kg and 91.1 kg, respectively. This was 
reflected in differences in the BMI; BMI was not an independent covariate. Mean MDG and FPG at 
baseline was lowest in the 25 mg dose group. Baseline MDG was 113.1 mg/dL in the 125mg group, 
137.4 mg/dL in the 5mg group and 151.5 mg/dL in the 10 mg dose group. Likewise, mean UGE at 
baseline was lowest in the 25 mg dose group with 0.08 g/24h compared with 16.2 g/24h in the 5 mg 
dose group and 12.3 g/24h in the 10 mg dose group. The low baseline FPG and MDG in the 25 mg may 
affect the effect of empagliflozin, as the sodium-glucose linked transporter is less active when glucose 
levels are (almost) normal. Furthermore, the race distribution was uneven, with the 3 treated 
American Indian/Alaska Native being all in the 10 mg dose group.  
In paediatric trial (1245.87) the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin has been appropriately 
characterised. Empagliflozin plasma exposure increased with increasing dose in the studied population, 
there was no obvious deviation from dose proportional pharmacokinetics. The median tmax was 
approximately 1.5 h for all dose groups and the mean terminal half-life was 7 to 8 h. These results are 
in line with the PK characteristics and exposure in adults, according to current SPC (based on adult 
data only) empagliflozin displays linear pharmacokinetics, has a tmax of 1.5 h and a terminal half-life of

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

12.4 h. The steady state mean plasma AUC and Cmax were 1870 nmol.h/l and 259 nmol/l with 
empagliflozin 10 mg and 4740 nmol.h/l and 687 nmol/l with empagliflozin 25 mg once daily. 
The median body weight differed considerable between the dosing groups weight (5 mg: 86.6 kg, 
10mg: 120 kg, 25 mg: 82.4 kg) which might explain the slightly lower exposure in the 10 mg dose 
group compared to the 5 and 25 mg dose group.  
A dose-dependent increase from baseline in UGE in the 24 h following empagliflozin administration was 
observed in the paediatric patients. In all 3 dose groups, this increase in UGE was accompanied by a 
decrease from baseline in FPG at 24 h post-dose and by a decrease from baseline in MDG in the 24 h 
following empagliflozin administration.  
The relationship between empagliflozin exposure and UGE was graphically explored. Due to the large 
variability of the data (especially the UGE values in the 5 mg and 10 mg dose groups), probably 
caused by differences in body weight and effect of body weight on UGE. However, the exposure-
response profile seemed comparable in the paediatric subjects as in adults (Figure 4).  
All 3 single doses of empagliflozin were well tolerated in this trial. The safety results of this trial were 
consistent with those observed in previous empagliflozin trials with adults. No new safety signals were 
observed. 
Population PK-PD study er-uge-t2dm-pediatrics 
The exposure-response characterizing the change from baseline in 24 h UGE was best described by an 
Emax model with inter-individual variability on baseline UGE during both analyses, the analysis of the 
adult population and the joint population. 
The results from the covariate analysis are in line with results from previous analysis (c02089743 and 
c02090424).Only the influence of body weight with a higher drug effect in heavier patients was not 
previously identified as such. Therefore, weight based dosing may be more appropriate than fixed 
dosing. 
The effect of the covariate Asian race is entirely driven by the adult population, only one Asian 
paediatric subject was included in the analysis, therefore the model cannot be used to predict 
appropriate dose for Asian paediatric subjects.  
Based on the population PK/PD model age is apparently not a relevant covariate. 
The covariate analysis based on the base model for the joint (adult and paediatric) population did not 
reveal any statistically significant difference between the two populations after accounting for 
significant covariates (baseline MDG, weight, Asian race, female Sex). The included covariates were 
able to explain the slightly lower absolute increase in UGE in the paediatric population at comparable 
doses. However the paediatric baseline 24 h UGE observations (table 6 and 7) mentioned in the 
population report are not identical to the values mentioned in the study report 1245.87 (table 1). The 
company should explain the difference and provide the correct calculations if needed. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Based on the results of paediatric study 1245.87 and the Population PK-PD study er-uge-t2dm-
pediatrics it can be concluded that Empagliflozin displays comparable pharmacokinetics between adult 
and paediatric patients with T2DM and it can be concluded that the exposure-response of adult and 
paediatric patients with T2DM is comparable after accounting for significant covariates which explain 
differences in the studied patient populations. Some of the data present in study 1245.87 and the pop

PK-PD study seemed to be inconsistent. However, the Applicant has explained the figures and no 
inconsistency was present. 
Given the uncertainties, the use of empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg in the planned Phase III study in in 
children and adolescent patients with T2DM which corresponds to the same doses that are approved in 
adult patients with T2DM, is considered acceptable.

4.  Additional clarification requested 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this 
procedure: 
1.  MAH should explain the difference between the paediatric baseline 24 h UGE observations 
mentioned in the population report and the baseline 24 h UGE observations mentioned in the 
study report 1245.87 , as the values are not identical. If needed the company should provide 
correct recalculations. 
2.  Body weight was identified as a relevant covariate for urine glucose excretion. The company is 
asked to evaluate the effect of weight in adolescents and children in the other planned studies 
in the paediatric population and to assess if weight based dosing may be more appropriate   
3.  Based on the PK results provided in the paediatric study 1245.87, it can be concluded that 
empagliflozin increases in AUC and Cmax were less than dose proportional from 5 to 10 mg 
empagliflozin and more than dose proportional from 10 to 25 mg empagliflozin. The lower 
exposure in the 10 mg dose group could be related to a body weight factor. In comparison to 
the original results obtained in adult patients with T2DM and in healthy volunteers in which a 
linear PK is shown, dose-proportionality/linearity in the paediatric population within the 
therapeutic range should be further discussed taking into account the body weight factor and 
the potential impact on efficacy/safety should be investigated. 
4.  NCA was used to characterise patient exposure. However, AUC0 to 24h on day 1 was used as 
exposure marker, with relatively sparse sampling in the paediatric population. The MAH should 
comment the possibility to use a model based approach for PK description and to test the 
influence of covariates such as bodyweight on drug PK. 
5.  MAH responses to Request for supplementary information 
Question 1 
MAH should explain the difference between the paediatric baseline 24h UGE observations 
mentioned in the population report and the baseline 24 h UGE observations mentioned in 
the study report 1245.87, as the values are not identical. If needed the company should 
provide correct recalculations. 
Applicant’s response 
The distribution of baseline UGE for the paediatric study population of 1245.87 is summarised in Table 
15.3: 2 of the population report [c09146085] and in Table 15.1.4: 8 of the clinical trial report 
[c09062077]. As given in Table 15.3: 2 of the population report, the mean baseline UGE is reported to 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

be 8.79 g/d with a standard deviation of 22.1 g/d. This is identical to the values given in Table 15.1.4: 
8 of the clinical trial report, where the mean baseline UGE is reported to be 8.79 g/24 h with a 
standard deviation of 22.13 g/24 h. In addition to the mean, the median baseline UGE is provided. In 
Table 15.3: 2 of the population report, the median (2.5th, 95th percentile) is reported to be 0.08 
(0.00, 77.1) g/d; the minimum value is 0.0 g/d and the maximum value is 88.0 g/d. This corresponds 
to the values as given in Table 15.1.4: 8 of the clinical trial report where the median is reported to be 
0.08 g/d with a minimum value of 0.0 g/d and a maximum value of 88.0 g/d. 
Assessor’s response 
The Applicant has explained the figures of baseline UGE in the paediatric study and the population 
report. There are no differences between the paediatric baseline 24 h UGE observations mentioned in 
both reports. 
Conclusion 
Issue resolved. 
Question 2 
Body weight was identified as a relevant covariate for urine glucose excretion. The company 
is asked to evaluate the effect of weight in adolescents and children in the other planned 
studies in the paediatric population and to assess if weight based dosing may be more 
appropriate. 
Applicant’s response 
The MAH did so far not consider weight-based dosing in adolescent and paediatric patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus due to the following reasons (details are presented below): 
 
in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus body size in terms of body mass index (BMI) did 
only show a minor impact on empagliflozin exposure and efficacy in terms of HbA1c lowering 
which was not considered to be clinically relevant, and 
 
the distribution of BMI in the paediatric and adult population was comparable in the present 
study and is expected to be comparable in future studies. 
Nevertheless, the impact of covariates such as a measure of body size on pharmacokinetic (PK) and 
pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoints will be characterized when further data from the paediatric 
development program will become available. 
During the exposure-response analysis for the effect of a single dose of empagliflozin on 24 h urinary 
glucose excretion in the joint (adult and paediatric) population, body weight was identified as a 
covariate with a statistically significant influence. In the current best model, a higher body weight 
results in a higher drug effect. Previous population analyses also showed an influence of body size on 
the PK of empagliflozin and its effect on fasting plasma glucose (FPG)/HbA1c lowering. In these 
previous analyses body mass index (BMI) was identified to have an effect on PK (with a higher BMI 
resulting in lower exposure) and on PD (with a higher BMI resulting in less HbA1c reduction). The 
different findings, i.e. higher body weight leading to higher UGE and higher BMI leading to less HbA1c 
reduction have been discussed in the population PK/PD report. The influence of BMI on PK and PD 
identified in the previously conducted population PK and PK/PD analyses was considered to be not 
clinically relevant in the adult population as the influence was only minor. When compared to a 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

reference patient (BMI 25 kg/m2), a BMI of 20 kg/m2 resulted in a median increase in AUC of only 
7.5% and a BMI of 45 kg/m2 in a median decrease in AUC of only -17.3%. 
To further assess the impact of BMI on HbA1c, simulations were carried out based on the current best 
model for FPG/HbA1c lowering. The simulations were performed using the fixed-effects parameters and 
their uncertainty obtained from the covariance matrix of the estimates; the results are summarized 
below (Figure 2: 1). The simulations show that compared to a reference patient (BMI 25 kg/m2; 
duration of diabetes 1.5 years with no concomitant antidiabetic therapy), the change from baseline in 
HbA1c was increased by a factor of only 1.0 for a patient with a BMI of 20 kg/m2 and decreased by a 
factor of 0.88 for a patient with a BMI of 45 kg/m2. Based on these findings there is no weight-based 
dosing recommendation for adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
Table 2: 1 summarizes the BMI distribution based on a population PK analysis (pool of 10 studies in 
adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, PK dataset which is comparable to the one in the

paediatric study population of 1245.87 and the paediatric study population of 1218.56, a Phase IIb 
dose-finding trial for linagliptin in children and adolescent patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It 
shows that in terms of body size the paediatric patient populations are comparable to the adult 
population and hence, no influence of body size beyond the influence that was seen in adult patients is 
expected. Nevertheless, the MAH will investigate the influence of body size (e.g. weight or BMI) on PK 
and the primary PD endpoint (change from baseline HbA1c after 24 weeks) in the upcoming Phase 3 
trial investigating the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin and linagliptin over 24 weeks in children and 
adolescents with T2DM. This study is part of the approved PIPs for empagliflozin and linagliptin. 
Assessor’s response 
The Applicant provided information on the effect of the BMI on the PK of empagliflozin, but not on the 
effect of body weight on the PK. The MAH stated that they will investigate the influence of body size 
(e.g. weight or BMI) on PK and the primary PD endpoint (change from baseline HbA1c after 24 weeks) 
in the upcoming Phase 3 trial investigating the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin and linagliptin over 
24 weeks in children and adolescents with T2DM. The MAH is requested to investigate the influence of 
weight and BMI on PK and the primary PD endpoint in the upcoming Phase 3 trial in order to answer 
this question. 
Conclusion 
Issue not resolved. The company is asked to commit to investigate the influence of weight and BMI on 
PK and the primary PD endpoint in the upcoming Phase 3 trial. 
Question 3 
Based on the PK results provided in the paediatric study 1245.87, it can be concluded that 
empagliflozin increases in AUC and Cmax were less than dose proportional from 5 to 10 mg 
empagliflozin and more than dose proportional from 10 to 25 mg empagliflozin. The lower 
exposure in the 10 mg dose group could be related to a body weight factor. In comparison 
to the original results obtained in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and in healthy 
volunteers in which a linear PK is shown, dose-proportionality/linearity in the paediatric 
population within the therapeutic range should be further discussed taking into account the 
body weight factor and the potential impact on efficacy/safety should be investigated. 
Applicant’s response 
The MAH believes that there was no significant deviation from dose proportionality in the paediatric 
population over the range of empagliflozin 5 to 25 mg; body weight affected the pharmacokinetics of 
empagliflozin, but not to a clinically important degree.

In the adult population, empagliflozin exposure increased in a roughly dose proportional manner 
following single oral administration over the dose range 0.5 mg to 800 mg in healthy volunteers, as 
well as following multiple once daily doses over the studied dose range 2.5 mg to 100 mg. In the 
paediatric study 1245.87, the dose-normalized AUC and Cmax values were similar between 
empagliflozin 5 mg and 25 mg doses, but were ~ 32% and 26% lower, respectively, with empagliflozin 
10 mg. The lower exposure at empagliflozin 10 mg may be partially explained by the larger body size 
in this dose group (mean BMI 39.6 kg/m2 at 10 mg vs ~ 33.8 kg/m2 at the other doses). 
Based on the population PK model developed in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus where BMI 
was identified as a covariate, an increase in BMI from 33.8 to 39.6 kg/m2 would lead to a 4.91% 
decrease in AUC. The remaining unexplained deviation from linearity at the 10 mg dose may be due to 
the variability inherent with the small sample size of the study, particularly in the context of dose 
linearity observed in adults and overall comparable exposure between the adult and paediatric 
population. 
In order to further understand the effect of body size on dose-proportionality, an additional analysis of 
dose proportionality was performed for trial 1245.87, first including weight as an additional covariate in 
the power model, and second including BMI as an additional covariate. This was done for the three PK 
parameters AUC0-∞, AUC0-tz, and Cmax. A summary of the results is displayed in Table 3: 1 below. The 
slope parameter for log(dose) is denoted by β, and the slope parameter for the additional covariate is 
denoted by α. For comparison reasons, the initial model with α=0 is included in the table. 
The results show that adjusting the dose proportionality model for weight or BMI does not relevantly 
change the initial slope estimates β for log(dose). The standard errors for the slope estimates are 
reduced, resulting in narrower confidence intervals, which still include 1 in each case. The slope 
estimates α for weight and BMI, respectively, are negative (as expected), and their confidence 
intervals do not include 0. However, due to the small magnitudes of these slopes, varying the weight

or the BMI over the observed ranges in the trial would not result in relevant changes in log(AUC) or 
log(Cmax), respectively. 
The results of this linearity analysis are consistent with the population PK model in adult patients with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus which assessed the influence of body size on empagliflozin exposure (see 
Question 2). The impact of BMI is small and is not considered clinically meaningful. Taken all together, 
the MAH is of the opinion that body size does statistically influence the pharmacokinetics of 
empagliflozin, but the effect is not clinically meaningful. The PK is roughly dose-proportional in the 
paediatric patients despite the variability observed at the 10 mg dose. 
Assessor’s response 
Empagliflozin exposure increased in a roughly dose proportional manner following single oral 
administration over the dose range 0.5 mg to 800 mg in healthy adult volunteers and over a dose 
range of 5 mg to 25 mg in the paediatric population. The Applicant stated that the less than dose-
proportional increase at a dose of 5 to 10 mg is most likely due to an increase in BMI compared to the 
5 mg and 25 mg dose group and to variability due to the small sample size. A 4.9% decrease in AUC 
would be expected based on Population PK modelling. However, the decrease in exposure of 26-32% is 
more than expected based on the Population PK modelling.  
The Applicant provided information on the effect of the BMI on the PK of empagliflozin. However, as in 
Question 2 the MAH was also requested to provide information on the effect of weight on the PK. Since 
Question 2 is not resolved, this issue will not be pursued and the answer to Question 2 is awaited. 
Conclusion 
Issue no longer pursued. 
Question 4 
Non-compartmental analysis was used to characterise patient exposure. However, AUC 0 to 
24h on day 1 was used as exposure marker, with relatively sparse sampling in the paediatric 
population. The MAH should comment the possibility to use a model based approach for PK 
description and to test the influence of covariates such as bodyweight on drug PK. 
Applicant’s response 
The MAH is of the opinion, that it is valid to use AUC0-24 calculated via non-compartmental analysis as 
input for the exposure-response analysis for the following reasons: 
 
using the AUC0-24 from a non-compartmental analysis the influence of covariates, including 
body weight, is implicitly considered. 
 
due to the number of patients included in 1245.87, using a model-based approach might lead 
to imprecise PK parameter estimates, which, in turn might influence the characterization of the 
exposure-response relationship. 
 
The reduced sampling scheme in 1245.87 (compared to adult studies) leads to less than 5% 
difference in parameter estimates for the Cmax and the AUC0-24 based on non-compartmental 
analysis. 
 
In 1245.78 AUC0-24 covers approximately 90% of AUC0-∞ consistently across all dose groups (5, 
10 and 25 mg).

Nevertheless, the impact of covariates on pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoints 
will be characterized when further data from the paediatric development program will become available 
(see also response to Question 2). 
The objective of the analysis was to compare the exposure-response in paediatric patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus with the one in adult patients. In the single dose setting of study 1245.87, the 
parameter which was considered most suitable was urinary glucose excretion during the first 24 h after 
drug administration (UGE0-24) and the corresponding exposure measure AUC0-24 (only UGE0-24 (not e.g. 
UGE0-48) was available in adults). The sample size calculation was based on a precision calculation for 
Cmax and AUC0-∞, in order to ensure that PK parameters in the paediatric patient population can be 
determined with the required precision for the within-group geometric means (90% probability for a 
factor of two between upper and lower limit of the 95% confidence interval). The calculations 
considered inter-individual variability of the PK parameters from two studies conducted in adult 
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus which had a rather rich PK sampling schedule. As the frequency 
of blood sampling is often of concern in paediatric studies, study 1245.87 was designed to obtain 
meaningful results with a reduced sampling scheme compared to the adult studies. To evaluate the 
reduced sampling scheme of 1245.87 on parameter estimation, the PK parameters in adult patients 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus of study 1245.4 were re-estimated based on the reduced sampling 
scheme as implemented in 1245.87. The differences in Cmax and AUC0-24 were less than 0.4% and 
5.0%, respectively (see Table 4: 1), further supporting the adequacy of the sampling scheme for a 
non-compartmental analysis in the paediatric study. 
The small differences in PK parameter estimates are most likely due the fact, that although PK blood 
sampling was less frequent in study 1245.87 compared to that in adults, the sampling scheme in 
paediatrics (11 samples per patient) was not sparse and describes the plasma concentration profiles of 
empagliflozin reasonably well. The Cmax was adequately captured with two samples before tmax 
(~1.5 h) and seven samples up to 48 h post tmax which covered ≥5 times terminal half-lives and 
sufficiently described the distribution/elimination phase. Furthermore, the contribution of AUC0-24 to 
AUC0-∞ was calculated based on the non-compartmental analysis results and was 89.5%, 90.2% and 
90.1% for the empagliflozin 5, 10 and 25 mg dose groups, respectively.

Based on the fact that the sample size of the study was calculated to enable the characterization of PK 
via non-compartmental analysis, the fact that there is less than 5.0% difference in parameter 
estimates when comparing the extensive with the reduced sampling scheme, and the fact that for all 
dose groups AUC0-24 covers approximately 90% of AUC0-∞ in study 1245.87 the MAH is of the opinion 
that it is valid to use AUC0-24 calculated via non-compartmental analysis as input for the exposure 
response analysis. Moreover by using the observed AUC the influence of covariates, including body 
weight, is implicitly considered. Due to the relatively small sample size in study 1245.87 using a 
model-based approach might lead to imprecise PK parameter estimates which in turn might influence 
parameter estimation for the characterization of the exposure-response. 
The influence of body size on empagliflozin exposure was previously assessed in a population PK 
analysis in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and only showed a minor impact (see Question 
2). When compared to a reference patient (body mass index, BMI: 25 kg/m2) a BMI of 20 kg/m2 
resulted in a median change in AUC of only 7.5% and a BMI of 45 kg/m2 in a change of AUC of -
17.3%). The distribution of BMI in the study population of 1245.87 was comparable to the one in the 
population PK analysis with a median (range) in adult patients of 28.9 (16.8-50.3) kg/m2 and a median 
(range) in paediatric patients of 35.8 (23.4-48.3) kg/m2. With further data from the paediatric 
development program becoming available, the impact of covariates on PK and PD endpoints will be 
characterized (see response to Question 2). 
Assessor’s response 
Non-compartmental analysis was used to calculate the PK parameters in paediatric study 1245.87. The 
reduced sampling schedule was based on the inter-individual variability of the PK parameters from two 
studies conducted in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus which had a rather rich PK sampling 
schedule. The sampling schedule in study 1245.87 consisted of 11 blood samples with two samples 
before tmax (~1.5 h), 2 samples around Cmax and seven samples up to 48 h post tmax (covering ≥5 
times terminal half-lives and sufficiently described the distribution/elimination phase). The contribution 
of AUC0-24 to AUC0-∞ was 89.5%, 90.2% and 90.1% for the 5, 10 and 25 mg empagliflozin dose groups, 
respectively, calculated using non-compartmental analysis. Overall, the sampling schedule in the 
paediatric population is sufficient to accurately calculate the PK parameters using non-compartmental 
analysis. AUC0-24 can be used for PK-PD correlation determination with UGE0-24 in the paediatric 
population. The use of a model based approach to calculate the PK parameters in the paediatric study 
is not needed. 
The influence of body weight on the PK is further discussed in the response to Question 2. 
Conclusion 
Issue resolved. The influence of bodyweight on the PK is further pursued in Question 2.

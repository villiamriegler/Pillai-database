SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
Introduction 
This submission concerns a type II variation to Arava in response to the EMEA letter dated 25 March 
2005 on the submission of data concerning the use of medicinal products in children. 
Of the many subtypes of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), active polyarticular course JRA (APC-JRA) 
is  widely  regarded  as  the  paediatric  equivalent  to  adult  RA.  Both  conditions  share  many  clinical  and 
pathophysiological  features.  APC-JRA  is  the  second  most  frequent  type  of  paediatric  RA,  affecting 
approximately  20  to  40%  of  all  children  with  JRA.  The  European  League  of  Associations  for 
Rheumatology (EULAR) and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) both recognise this subtype 
of paediatric arthritis and have established the key diagnostic criteria and pattern of joint involvement 
which characterise each of the major variants of JRA, including APC-JRA.  
Currently the repertoire of medicinal products approved for the treatment of JRA in Europe is limited. 
Only two compounds are available in Europe, methotrexate (MTX), a Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic 
Drug (DMARD) and etanercept, a biological. The efficacy of MTX in JRA has been  demonstrated since 
1992.  Compared  to  placebo,  MTX  was  shown  to  have  improved  efficacy  with  an  acceptable  safety 
profile  in  children  with  APC-JRA.  However,  the  frequency  and  severity  of  side  effects  increase  with 
higher doses, and drug resistance to MTX may develop when used over the long term. 
Etanercept  is  a  genetically  engineered  fusion  protein  that  binds  the  pro-inflammatory  cytokine  tumor 
necrosis  factor  (TNF)  and  lymphotoxin-inhibiting  their  activity.  It  has  been  established  that  TNF-
inhibition by etanercept is effective at controlling APC-JRA with acceptable tolerability. Etanercept is 
approved in Europe for second-line therapy of JRA. 
Leflunomide  is  a  DMARD  approved  for  the  treatment  of  adult  RA.  Leflunomide  is  an  isoxazole 
immunomodulatory agent with a unique mechanism of action. It inhibits de novo pyrimidine synthesis 
by  reversibly  blocking  the  enzyme  dihydroorotate  dehydrogenase,  resulting in  antiproliferative  effects 
on activated lymphocytes important in the pathogenesis of rheumatic diseases like RA.  
Due  to  the  similarities  between  APC-JRA  and  adult  RA,  it  was  anticipated  that  patients  with  APC-JRA 
might  also  benefit  from  treatment  with  leflunomide.  The  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  has 
therefore completed clinical trials to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and efficacy profile of 
leflunomide in the treatment of APC-JRA in paediatric population between the ages of 3 and 17 years. 
Please  note  that  according  to  the  concept  paper  from  the  CHMP  on  points  to  consider  on  clinical 
investigation  of  medicinal  products  for  the  treatment  of  JIA,  issued  on  26  February  2004 
(CPMP/EWP/422/04), the terms juvenile chronic arthritis and JRA have been replaced by JIA. However, 
as the clinical program with leflunomide in children with JRA was initiated prior to this paper, all of the 
documentation of this dossier refers to JRA instead of JIA.  
For this application the following (concept) guidelines are applicable: concept paper from the CHMP on 
points to consider on clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of JIA, issued on 4-
7-2005  (CPMP/EWP/422/04),  and  ICH  Topic  E11  Clinical  investigations  of  medicinal  products  in  the 
paediatric population (CHMP/ICH/2711/99).  
Clinical aspects 
A  clinical  program  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  leflunomide  in  paediatric  patients  with  APC-
JRA was implemented. Two studies (HWA486/1037 and HWA486/3503) were conducted in children 
with JRA. Both studies were followed by an extension study to gather further data on the durability of 
efficacy over the long term. In addition, to assess efficacy and safety of leflunomide in this population, 
the  pharmacokinetic  of  leflunomide  and  its  active  metabolite  were  assessed  based  on  data  collected 
from  blood  samples  taken  in  both  studies,  and  analysed  collectively  after  completion  of  both  studies. 
One of the objectives of the PPK (population pharmacokinetics) analysis was to determine appropriate 
dose recommendations for leflunomide use in the JRA population.

Study  HWA486/1037,  performed  in  children  (6  to  17  years),  was  a  Phase  Ib,  open  label  study  in 
subjects  with  APC-JRA  who  had  previously  failed  to  respond  to,  or  were  intolerant  of,  MTX  therapy. 
This  pilot  study  collected  preliminary  data  on  efficacy  and  improvement  (or  no  deterioration)  in 
physical  function  as  a  secondary  objective  in  order  to  determine  whether  therapy  with  leflunomide 
warranted further study in subjects with APC-JRA. The primary objective was to obtain PK and safety 
data  on  leflunomide.  Study  1037  was  6  months  in  duration  and  was  followed  by  an  extension  of  24 
months (Study 1037x). 
Study HWA486/3503 was a Phase III, randomised, double-dummy, double-blind study in children (3 
to  17  years)  performed  in  32  study  centres  in  the  US,  Canada,  New  Zealand,  Australia,  and  Europe 
comparing  leflunomide  to  MTX  with  folic  acid  supplementation  in  subjects  naïve  to  both  MTX  and 
leflunomide. The design was used as the current US FDA regulations and ethical considerations do not 
permit placebo-controlled trials in children if there is a valid approved comparator (MTX, sulfasalazine 
and  etanercept  are  all  approved  for  the  treatment  of  JRA  in  the  US).  Study  3503  was  4  months  in 
duration and was followed by an extension of 8 months (Study 3504). The double-blind of study 3503 
was maintained during the extension phase of Study 3504 (see table below).

All studies were conducted in accordance with good clinical practice (GCP), as required by the ICH E6 
Guideline for GCP, 1 May, 1996, in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki and standard operating 
procedures for clinical investigation and documentation in force at Aventis worldwide. 
Efficacy variables 
The  primary  efficacy  variable  in  both  studies  was  the  Definition  of  Improvement  (DOI),  a  responder 
analysis  in  JRA  published  by  Giannini  et  al.  (1997).  A  subject  was  considered  a  responder  if  >30% 
improvement (from baseline) occurred in >3 of 6 variables, with no more than 30% worsening (from 
baseline) in any one variable. The 6 outcome measures used to calculate the DOI are as follows:

1. Physician’s global assessment of disease severity. 
2. Subject or parent global assessment of overall well-being. 
3. Physical function, using the Child Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (CHAQDI). 
4. Number of joints with active arthritis, as defined by ACR criteria. 
5. Number of joints with limited range of motion (ROM) excluding sternoclavicular and sacroiliac joints. 
6. Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR).  
A  second  primary  efficacy  variable  was  used  in  Study  3503/3504,  the  Percent  Improvement  Index 
(PII).  The  PII  was  defined  as  the  average  percentage  change  from  baseline  over  the  six  outcome 
measures  assessed.  In  the  event  that  the  mean  percent  change  was  positive  (=worsening)  the  % 
improvement was set to zero.1  
Secondary  efficacy  variables  included  mean  changes  in  the  6  individual  components  of  the  DOI  (and 
PII in 3503/3504) as well as:

Statistics 
Efficacy  was  assessed  in  both  studies  in  the  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  population  defined  as  all  subjects 
enrolled who received at least one dose of study drug with one post baseline assessment. Where there 
were  missing  data  the  Last  Observation  Carried  Forward  (LOCF)  procedure  was  applied.  Supportive 
efficacy was assessed in the extension cohort of Study 1037x for the extension phase months 6 to 30. 
Due to the small sample size and open label treatment in Study 1037, it was prospectively defined that 
formal statistical testing of the safety and efficacy data would not be performed. The primary endpoint 
for this study was at the end of the 6-month treatment period (26 weeks). The efficacy data from the 
extension phase are presented and summarised as supporting efficacy information.  
The primary efficacy analysis in Study 3503 evaluated PII and DOI ≥ 30% at Week 16 and evaluated 
the durability of efficacy in the extension subjects from Week 16 to Week 48 of treatment (Week 0 to 
Week 32 of the extension) in its extension study 3504.  
Initially the study was designed as an equivalence study with one primary endpoint the PII. There 
where two major amendments from a methodological perspective. Following discussion with the FDA, 
the JRA DOI 30% responder rate became a co-primary endpoint (amendment 4, 30-05-2002) and the 
study was converted from an equivalence study to a superiority study (amendment 6 initiated 09-04-
2003) after which the last patients entered the study at 28-05-2003).  
1 As part of a sensitivity analysis additional definitions of  % Improvement were explored incorporating 
patients with < 30% worsening , with <100% worsening and any change. Results were robust (data 
not shown).

The  primary  hypothesis  was  that  there  where  treatment  difference  between  leflunomide  and  MTX  in 
the  primary  endpoints.  In  the  event  that  superiority  was  not  achieved  with  respect  to  the  PII  non-
inferiority was opted for with a non-inferiority margin of 12.5%.  
A  sample  size  of  37  subjects  per  group  was  calculated  as  necessary  to  observe  a  difference  in  the 
mean  PII  of  15%  or  greater,  with  a  standard  deviation  of  23%  (power  0.80).  In  the  event  that 
superiority was not achieved with respect to the % Improvement Index, then non-inferiority was to be 
claimed as indicated in the original protocol, i.e. when the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval of 
mean difference for the % Improvement Index is greater than or equal to –12.5%. 
The between-group comparisons conducted at Week 16 as well as at Week 48 of treatment (extension 
Week 32), and for each visit since the start of study treatment in Study 3503, used an analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) with treatment and site (pooled) as fixed effects for the PII, and the Cochran 
Mantel-Haenszel procedure controlling for site (pooled) for the JRA DOI ≥ 30%, responder rates. 
To assess durability of efficacy, a within-group comparison of mean values at Week 16 versus Week 48 
(study  end-point)  of  treatment  and  other  time-points  (secondary  efficacy  analysis)  was  conducted 
using ANOVA, with visit and subject as fixed effects, for the PII, and a McNemar test for the responder 
rates.  
Subgroup  analyses  were  predefined  in  Study  3503  to  investigate  the  consistency  of  effect  across 
various subgroups. Subgroups concerned age, sex, race, duration of JRA, baseline swollen joint count 
and  endpoint  dose.  For  the  PII,  ANOVA  was  used  with  treatment,  centre,  background  variable  and 
treatment  by  background  variable  interaction  as  fixed  effects.  For  the  JAR  DOI  responders  a  logistic 
regression was used for the same covariates.  
Results 
Dose response studies 
Results  of  the    population  pharmacokinetics  (PPK)  analysis  were  used  to  determine  appropriate  dose 
recommendations for leflunomide use in the JRA population (see section 2.3 “Pharmacokinetics”). The 
optimal daily dose of leflunomide based on body weight is shown in table 3:  
Table 3 
Nevertheless, only 5 and 10 mg regimens have been clinically tested (10 mg every other day for 
children under 20 kg and 10 mg per day for children between 20 and 40 kg).

Due to the small number of subjects remaining in the 1037 extension study by the time any subjects 
had  completed  130  weeks  of  treatment,  the  study  was  ended  before  all  remaining  subjects  had  the 
opportunity to complete 130 weeks of treatment. At that time, 3 (17.7%) subjects had completed 130 
weeks  and  the  6  (35.3%)  others  still  remaining  had  not.  During  the  extension  phase,  8  (47.1%) 
subjects withdrew (5 lack of efficacy, 1 adverse event and 2 for other reasons). 
Sixteen subjects who completed Study 3503 did not enrol in extension Study 3504 (9 leflunomide and    
7  MTX  subjects).  During  the  extension  phase,  15  of  the  70  subjects  withdrew,  the  reasons  for  which 
were  lack  of  efficacy  (5  leflunomide,  0  MTX),  an  adverse  event  (1  leflunomide,  5  MTX),  withdrew 
consent  (1  leflunomide,  1  MTX),  progression  of  disease  (1  leflunomide,  0  MTX)  and  other  reasons        
(1 leflunomide, 0 MTX). 
Baseline characteristics 
All 27 subjects in Study 1037 had APC-JRA and had failed MTX therapy (15 due to lack of efficacy and 
12 as a result of intolerance) and all 94 subjects in Study 3503 were MTX naïve at the start of the 
study (see further, table). Mean age in study 1037 was 12.3 yrs in the Leflunomide group (85% 
female) and 13.3 yrs in the MTX group (83% female) and in study 3503 10.1 yrs in the Leflunomide 
group (75% female) and 10.2 yrs in the MTX group (72% female). 
In  Study  1037,  the  pattern  of  disease  at  onset  of  JRA  in  the  ITT  subjects  was  polyarticular  in                
19,  pauciarticular  in  6,  and  systemic  in  2  subjects.  Eight  subjects  were  RF+.  Mean  disease  duration 
was  7.0  years.  Concomitant  medications  included  non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs)  in          
22 (81.5%), corticosteroids in 18 (66.7%) and both in 16 (59.3%) subjects. 
Subjects  in  Study  3503  were  required  to  have  polyarticular  course  JRA  at  baseline.  The  majority  of 
subjects  in  both  treatment  groups  had  polyarticular  JRA  at  onset  of  disease.  Ten  subjects  were  RF+. 
The mean disease duration was approximately 1.5 years with a median duration of 0.33 years, and all 
but       6 subjects were DMARD-naïve. 
Mean  baseline  levels  for  physician’s  global  assessment  of  disease  severity,  subject  or  parent  global 
assessment of overall well-being, CHAQDI, number of joints with active arthritis, number of joints with 
limited ROM and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) were in study  1037 5.58, 4.37, 1.33, 14.85, 
20.59,  43.54,  respectively.  The  baseline  levels  of  these  measures  in  study  3503  were  summarized in  
table 5:

Treatment duration and exposure 
In  study  1037,  mean  duration  of  leflunomide  therapy  was  22  weeks  (1  to  30  weeks).  Mean  loading 
dose was 79.63 mg and mean maintenance dose 12.22 mg. The dose of study drug was increased in               
20 subjects (74.1%). In 2 subjects subsequent dose reductions were required due to adverse events. 
Over the 130 weeks of treatment in the extension Study 1037x, the extension cohort was exposed to 
leflunomide  for  a  mean  duration  of  95.9  weeks.  The  treatment  exposure  to  leflunomide  in  the 
extension cohort over the entire 30 month study period was 31.2 patient years. 
In  study  3503,  there  were  no  significant  differences  between  the  groups  in  mean  study  duration  or 
drug exposure. Leflunomide dose was reduced in 1 subject (adverse event) and MTX dose was reduced 
Assessment report

in            2  subjects  (1  due  to  adverse  event)  while  the  MTX  dose  was  increased  in  1  subject  and 
leflunomide placebo dose increased in 1 subject. 
Over the 48 weeks of treatment in the extension Study 3504, the duration of exposure to study 
medication in the extension population was comparable between the treatment groups. The largest 
proportion of extension subjects received study medication for 337 to 364 days in both treatment 
groups. 
Primary efficacy  
In study 1037, one-third of subjects in the ITT efficacy analysis were responders at week 4 (9/27) and 
week 8 (10/27). These results increased to 14/27 or 51.9% at Week 12, the maximum response rate, 
which was sustained through Week 26 (see figure below). 
Although 14 subjects were DOI >30% responders after 26 weeks of therapy using LOCF, 17 subjects 
entered the extension phase. Thirteen of the 17 subjects who entered the extension phase were 
responders at Week 26. During the long-term extension of Study 1037, DOI response rates were 
maintained in the 17 subjects who entered this phase of the study. After 30 months of treatment, 
52.9% of subjects reached the target of a DOI response of 30%. No additional subjects withdrew for 
lack of efficacy during the extension. 
In study 3505, two primary efficacy outcome variables were assessed, DOI response rates at 30% and 
PII.  Improvement  occurred  with  subjects  achieving  a  DOI  of  30%  response  after  approximately  2 
months  and  remaining  responders  thereafter.  At  endpoint,  after  16  weeks  of  treatment,  a  DOI 
response of 30% had been achieved in 89.4% of MTX subjects and 68.1% of leflunomide subjects and 
the  adjusted  mean  improvement  in  the  PII  was  –44.4%  in  the  leflunomide  group  and  –52.9%  in  the 
MTX group (see table below). The difference in response rates was statistically significant in favour of 
MTX  for  the  DOI  ≥  30%  (p=0.02),  but  not  for  the  PII  (p=0.18).  One  patient  in  each  treatment  arm 
discontinued  the  study  for  lack  of  efficacy.  The  DOI  ≥  30%  responder  rate  and  the  PII  achieved  at 
Week  16  were  maintained  in  both  treatment  groups  throughout  the  extension  Study  3504  but  the 
difference between treatment groups for DOI ≥ 30% was no longer statistically significant in the Study 
3504 efficacy evaluable population at endpoint (Week 48) of the extension (p=0.15).

Primary efficacy subgroups  
Data  assessed  as  a  function  of  age  and  weight  for  both  efficacy  outcome  measures  in  Study  3503 
demonstrated  no  statistically  significant  difference  in  effect  size  between  the  two  treatment  arms  for 
any  of  the  subgroups.  The  data  indicate  that  age  and  body  weight  had  an  effect  on  the  response. 
Younger (<12 years), lighter (<20 kg) subjects showed a better response in the MTX group compared 
to  the  leflunomide  group  than  older,  heavier  subjects,  indicating  that  younger,  lighter  children  were 
not  responding  as  well  to  the  leflunomide  treatment  as  their  older,  heavier  counterparts.  This  is 
consistent with the results of the PPK analysis, which demonstrated that the mean exposure to M1 (the 
primary metabolite) obtained in responders was about 59% greater than what was achieved in those 
children    <20 kg, suggesting that the doses administered to subjects who weighed <20 kg may have 
resulted in less efficacious plasma concentrations (see table 8 below). 
The  results  of  the  within-group  comparison  of  the  PII  at  Week  16  compared  to  Week  48  to  evaluate 
durability  of  efficacy,  showed  that  the  improvement  seen  in  each  treatment  group  at  Week  16  was 
maintained at Week 48 (see table 9).

This  is  also  supported  by  DOI  30%  responder  rates:  in  the  Leflunomide  group,  the  DOI  30% 
responder  rate  was  78.8  and  78.8%  at  week  16  and  48  respectively,  in  the  MTX  group  91.4  and 
91.4%, respectively. 
Secondary efficacy   
In Study 1037, improvements were observed in all secondary outcome variables with the exception of 
the number of joints with reduced mobility (see table below). Improvements were observed from Week 
4  and  sustained  throughout  the  26-week  treatment  period.  During  the  30-month  extension,  most  of 
these parameters continued to improve, and a reduction in the number of joints with limited mobility 
was seen after a total of thirty months’ treatment. 
In  Study  3503,  improvements  were  observed  in  all  the  secondary  outcome  variables  in  both  the 
leflunomide and MTX groups (see table below). The time to achieve a response during Study 3503 was 
similar in the 2 treatment groups, with a median time to reach a DOI ≥ 30% response of 52 days in 
the leflunomide groups and 56 days in the MTX group. The improvements achieved after 4 months of 
treatment in Study 3503 were sustained over the course of the long-term extension Study 3504, and 
subjects continued to improve over the following 8 months of treatment: by Week 48 of treatment an 
additional 1 leflunomide subject had achieved a DOI response of 50% and an additional 6 leflunomide 
subjects  and  4  MTX  subjects  achieved  a  response  rate  of  70%.  No  statistically  significant  differences 
were  observed  between  the  2  treatment  groups  at  any  of  the  time  points  for  any  secondary  variable 
during the extension Study 3054.

Subgroup analysis 
Regarding the following issues, the MAH did additional subgroup analysis to investigate: 
  The influence of corticosteroids on efficacy results for the percent improvement index (PII) 
and the Definition of Improvement 30% (JRA DOI 30%) variables, 
  The influence of Rheumatoid Factor (RF) positivity/negativity on efficacy results for the PII 
and the JRA DOI 30% parameters, 
  The  response  rate  of  JRA  patients  treated  with  placebo  in  different  placebo-controlled 
studies. 
Concerning  studies  HWA486/3503  (4-month  study)  and  HWA486/3504  (8-month  study),  on  basis  of 
these subgroups it was concluded that differences in mean PII parameter and JRA DOI 30% between 
leflunomide  and  MTX  are  consistent  across  levels  of  each  subgroup.  There  was  no  evidence  that  the 
durability of response was different by level of each subgroup variable.  
A summarise of the placebo effect observed in different placebo-controlled clinical studies conducted in 
JRA population to test MTX, sulfasalazine or etanercept was presented. The magnitude of the placebo 
effect in the different studies ranged from 16 to 36% and magnitude of effect of active controls was for 
etanercept1 80 %, MTX2 48% and sulphasalazine3 44%.

2.1  Clinical safety 
This  overview  discusses  all  adverse  events  that  were  treatment-emergent  (TEAEs),  i.e.  were  not 
present  at  baseline  and  occurred  on  treatment  or  during  the  post-treatment  follow-up  period;  or,  if 
present  at  baseline,  worsened  during  treatment  or  the  follow-up  period.  The  safety  data  from  study 
1037  and  its  long-term  extension  (a  total  of  30  months  of  treatment)  were  combined  for  a  single 
analysis,  whereas  separate  analyses  were  performed  for  the  data  from  study  3503  (4  months  of 
treatment) and its extension (study 3504, 8 months of treatment).  
The safety population in study 1037 comprised all 27 subjects who received at least one dose of study 
drug. During the 6-month treatment period, this safety population was exposed to study drug for a 
mean duration of 22 weeks or 154.3 days and 88.8% of subjects received study drug >85 days. 
Seventeen subjects participated in the extension phase (extension cohort) and received at least one 
dose of study drug. During the entire 30-month study, the extension cohort was exposed to study drug 
for a mean duration of 95.9 weeks or 671.12 days and 82.4% received study drug >518 days. 
In study 3503, there were 94 subjects in the safety population, 47 subjects in each treatment group. 
During  the  4-month  treatment  period,  mean  exposure  was  115  days  in  the  leflunomide  group  and         
116  days  in  the  MTX  group.  There  were  70  subjects  in  the  safety  population  of  the  extension  Study 
3504,  33  leflunomide  subjects  and  37  MTX  subjects.  During  the  entire  12  months  of  treatment,  the 
mean duration of exposure to study drug was 338 days in the leflunomide group and 349 days in the 
MTX group. 
The  majority  of  subjects  (>80%)  reported  at  least  1  TEAE  in  each  of  the  studies,  regardless  of  the 
treatment assignment (see table 11). 
Table 11 
A similar pattern was observed in leflunomide subjects in study 3503. However, the frequency of 
individual adverse events was systematically lower than in the previous study, which is to be expected 
due to the longer duration of study 1037. The nature and frequency of adverse events reported in 
subjects receiving MTX was very similar, although the incidence of headache and alopecia was 
somewhat lower. Possibly-related TEAEs were reported in 69.8% (30/43) of leflunomide subjects and 
55.3% (21/38) of MTX subjects. During the long-term extension (study 3504), the pattern and 
frequency of adverse events were essentially comparable to those seen in study 3503 (see table 12).

Table 12 
Serious AEs 
Thirteen serious AEs were reported in 7 (26.0%) subjects in study 1037 and its extension, one of 
which (JRA flare) occurred prior to receiving leflunomide. Two of the serious TEAEs (possible gastritis 
and anemia) occurred in 2 subjects during the first 26 weeks of therapy and the remaining 10 serious 
TEAEs in 5 subjects during the extension phase. The events were classified as serious because they 
were considered medically important and/or they required hospitalization. Five of the events were 
considered possibly related to study drug, and all 13 events resolved. 
In study 3503, 11 serious TEAEs were reported in 10 leflunomide subjects and no MTX subjects 
reported a serious TEAE. The majority of the serious TEAEs were not considered possibly related to 
treatment and of mild or moderate intensity. Three subjects discontinued treatment as a result of the 
serious adverse event. All serious TEAEs apart from the cases of Crohn's disease and pytiriasis 
resolved during the study period. During the extension Study 3504, 5 serious TEAEs were reported in                   
4 leflunomide subjects. One of these (colitis) was considered possibly treatment-related and led to 
treatment discontinuation. In addition, 16 serious TEAEs were reported in 9 MTX subjects. In 4 of 
these subjects, including 3 cases of transaminase elevations, the events were considered to be 
treatment-related. 
No deaths, malignancies, or pregnancies were reported in any of the studies. In Study 3503, overdoses 
were reported in 1 leflunomide subject (use of a 20 mg maintenance dose rather than 10 mg), and            
1 methotrexate subject (unplanned ingestion of 22.5 mg). None of these overdoses were associated 
with the occurrence of adverse events.  
Transaminase elevations and liver function 
In  study  1037,  6  (22.2%)  subjects  presented  clinically  significant  elevations  (>1.2  x  ULN)  in  alanine 
transaminase  (ALT),  aspartate  transaminase  (AST)  or  both,  4  of  which  were  reported  as  adverse 
events and 1 of which was serious.  
In study 3503, elevated transaminases were reported in 7 (14.9%) leflunomide subjects compared to      
15  (31.9%)  MTX  subjects.  Four  cases  in  each  group  were  reported  as  AEs.  Transaminase  levels

normalized  by  the  end  of  the  study  in  4  leflunomide  subjects  and  in  11  MTX  subjects,  and  remained 
above 2 x ULN in only 1 subject in each treatment group. 
In  the  extension  study  3504,  the  incidence  of  elevated  transaminases  was  lower  in  the  leflunomide 
treatment  group  (5  subjects,  15.2%)  compared  to  the  MTX  group  (11  subjects,  29.7%).  Moreover, 
transaminase levels in all the leflunomide subjects remained below 2 x ULN, whereas 5 MTX subjects 
reported  ALT  levels  above  this  limit,  including  1  subject  with  an  elevation  >8  x  ULN.  For  3  of  the 
methotrexate subjects, transaminase elevations were considered serious adverse events and treatment 
was  discontinued.  In  all  of  the  leflunomide  patients  (5/5)  and  9  of  the  11  methotrexate  subjects, 
transaminase levels subsequently normalized.  
Pharmacokinetics 
Two studies (HWA486/1037 and HWA486/3503) were conducted in children with JRA. Both studies 
were followed by an extension study to gather further data on the durability of efficacy over the long 
term. In addition, to assess efficacy and safety of leflunomide in this population, the pharmacokinetic 
(PK)  of  leflunomide  and  its  active  metabolite  were  assessed  based  on  data  collected  from  blood 
samples  taken  in  both  studies,  and  analyzed  collectively  after  completion  of  both  studies.  One  of  the 
objectives  of  the  population  pharmacokinetics  (PPK)  analysis  was  to  determine  appropriate  dose 
recommendations for leflunomide use in the JRA population. 
The  objectives  of  study  1037  were  to  determine  whether  therapy  with  leflunomide  warranted  further 
study in subjects with polyarticular course JRA by primarily obtaining pharmacokinetic and safety data 
and  secondarily  obtaining  preliminary  efficacy  and  functional  data  in  a  small  group  of  subjects.  As  a 
pilot  study  the  dose  selection  in  study  1037  was  based  on  the  target  M1  concentration  range  from 
adult experience and pharmacokinetic parameters scaled by body surface area. A population PK model 
was  developed  to  describe  the  data  and  the  relationship  between  the  estimated  pharmacokinetic 
parameters and demographic data in the JRA patient population. A simplified leflunomide dose regimen 
according to specific body weight categories was derived for study 3503. 
Study 1037 was an open-label, non-controlled, multi-center, Phase IB study over a 6-month treatment 
period with up to a 24-month extension phase. Study 3503 was a randomised, double blind, parallel 
group, 16-week treatment trial comparing leflunomide to methotrexate, in pediatric subjects with 
polyarticular course JRA who were DMARD-therapy naïve. 
Study  1037  was  conducted  in  pediatric  subjects  (aged  3-17  year)  with  active,  polyarticular  course 
juvenile  rheumatoid  arthritis  who  had  previously  failed  or  were  intolerant  of  methotrexate  therapy. 
Eligible subjects for study 3503 were pediatric patients 3 to 17 years of age with active, polyarticular 
course  JRA,  irrespective  of  onset  type,  who  were  naïve  to  treatment  with  either  leflunomide  or 
methotrexate. 
In  study  1037,  leflunomide  was  administered  orally  according  to  the  following  algorithm:  a  loading 
dose for 3 days according to body surface area (BSA) measured in square meters (m2) based on the 
labeled  adult  loading  dose  of  100  mg/day  for  3  days  and  an  average  adult  BSA  of  1.73  m2; 
maintenance doses were calculated based on a low adult dose of 10 mg/day and an average adult BSA 
of 1.73 m2. In subjects without clinical response on or after 8 weeks (based on Definition of Improvement 
[DOI]  responder  analysis  for  JRA  subjects  published  by  Giannini  et  al  [1997])  escalation  to  the 
equivalent  of  leflunomide  20  mg/day  per  1.73  m2
  BSA  was  allowed,  at  the  discretion  of  the 
investigator. A more simplified treatment regimen was developed for study 3503 based on the results 
of  study  1037.  Loading  doses  (some  multiple  of  100  mg  tablets)  and  maintenance  doses  (some 
multiple of 10 mg tablets) were assigned based on actual body weight as described in table PK 1.

In  study  1037  blood  samples  were  collected  from  each  subject  at  baseline  (prior  to  beginning  study 
treatment),  day  3  (last  day  of  the  loading  dose),  weeks  4,  12,  and  26  during  the  initial  6-month 
treatment phase. On day 3, weeks 4, 12, and 26, serial assessments (5 samples) were made at each 
visit.  In  addition,  single  samples  were  to  be  collected  on  several  pre-specified  occasions.  In  study 
3503, two blood samples were obtained for determination of leflunomide, M1 (the primary metabolite),

and TFMA (4-trifluoromethylaniline, a minor metabolite) concentrations in plasma at each of the study 
visits  for  weeks  2,  4,  8,  12,  and  16.  An  effort  was  made  to  collect  absorption  and  elimination  phase 
samples from each subject during the study. Fixed sampling times were not specified.  
Nonlinear mixed effect modeling (NONMEM) methods were applied to analyse the pooled data of the 
two studies. Only the M1 levels were used in the PPK modeling and the population mean and the 
variances of the pharmacokinetic parameters of M1 were obtained. The covariates including body 
surface area (BSA), body weight (WT), AGE, and SEX were tested to determine their influence on the 
PK of M1. Apparent oral total clearance (CL/F), apparent volume of distribution (V/F) and input rate 
constant (ka) were estimated for each individual subject by using the POSTHOC Bayesian approach 
based on the final optimal population model and individual specific PK information. The half-life of the 
apparent terminal disposition phase (t1/2) was to be calculated from the CL and V. 
The pharmacostatistical models were fitted to the data by the first order conditional estimation method 
(FOCE)  with  interaction.  The  NONMEM  stepwise  regressions  were  applied  to  determine  the  impact  of 
the  covariates  including  BSA,  WT,  AGE  and  SEX  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  M1.  The  final  optimal 
model  selected  was  evaluated  by  goodness-of-fit  plots,  cross-study  comparisons,  and  a  predictive 
check. 
The  PK  evaluable  population  consisted  of  73  subjects  (27  subjects  in  study  1037  and  46  subjects  in 
study  3503).  Of  these,  57  subjects  were  female  and  16  were  male,  with  ages  ranging  from  3  to  17 
years. The weight ranged from 13 to 75 kg and the body surface area (BSA) from 0.56 to 1.83 m2. A 
total of 674 observations were included in the PPK database. Of these, 493 observations were collected 
from study 1037 and 181 from study 3503. The number of observations per subject ranged from 1 to 
23,  with  an  average  of  9.2  observations  per  subject.  By  comparison,  more  sparse  PK  samples  were 
collected  in  study  3503  (mean:  3.9  observations  per  subject)  than  those  in  study  1037  (mean:  18.3 
observations per subject). In study 1037 only M1 plasma levels were determined, while in study 3503, 
plasma  levels  of  parent  could  not  be  detected  in  any  subject  and  only  low  TFMA  levels  could  be 
detected in some subjects. 
M1  disposition  was  well  described  by  a  one-compartment  model  with  first  order  input.  Inter-subject 
variability  was  described  by  an  exponential  error  model  on  the  structural  PK  parameters,  while  the 
residual variability was described by a proportional error model.  
The population PK parameters estimates of the final ‘optimal’ model are summarised in table PK 2, and 
the descriptive individual Bayesian Posthoc pharmacokinetic parameter estimated of the final model in

The  NONMEM  stepwise  regression  revealed  that  CL/F  was  weakly  correlated  with  body  size  (WT  or 
BSA),  and  V/F  was  strongly  correlated  with  body  size  (see  figures  below).  Sex  or  age  was  not  a 
significant  covariate  once  body  size  was  taken  into  consideration.  A  rather  weak  correlation  between 
the t1/2 of M1 and WT is demonstrated, indicating that the dosing interval of leflunomide should remain      
24 hours for the pediatric population. 
The difference in CL/F between the two extremes of body weight (70 and 14 kg, respectively) is 
approximately 50%, indicating that reduction of the maintenance dose by one half is only needed for 
pediatric patients weighing approximately 14 kg or less.  
Results of a CL/F by weight evaluation of the PPK  data demonstrated that pediatric APC-JRA patients 
with body weights <40 kg have a reduced clearance (CL) of M1 compared to those >40 kg (see table 
PK 3).

Previous obtained data in adults indicated that median values for Cl/F, Css and body weight in a total 
of 1171 adult patients with RA (Phase II and III combined data) were 0.024 l/h, 34 µg/ml and 70 kg, 
respectively. Based upon the final model obtained in this PPK analysis a Cl/F of 0.0254 l/h was 
predicted for a person weighing 70 kg. The relationship between Cl/F and WT in the JRA population 
(n=73) and adult RA patients (n=1171) is depicted in the figure below.  
As  body  size  and  V/F  is  strongly  correlated,  in  case  a  loading  dose  is  administered,  this  should  be 
adjusted for pediatric patients. However as a loading dose has been associated with acute tolerability 
problems, a loading dose is not recommended in pediatrics.  
The  figure  below  shows  the  typical  Css  (middle  line)  and  the  95%  prediction  interval  (outer  lines) 
plotted  against  body  weight  (WT)  after  doses  of  10,  15  and  20  mg,  respectively,  from  left  to  right. 
Targeting a median Css of 34 µg/ml for all pediatric patients on average, a dose of 10 mg daily should 
be  recommended  for  pediatric  patients  weighing  10  to  20  kg,  15  mg  daily  for  pediatric  patients 
weighing        20  to  40  kg,  and  20  mg  daily  for  those  weighing  >40  to  80  kg.  If  the  above  refined 
leflunomide dose recommendations for pediatrics were applied, the Css, as indicated by open circles in 
the  figure,  in  the  vast  majority  of  the  73  JRA  patients  would  have  fallen  within  the  95%  prediction 
interval with a median of approximately 34 µ/ml.

To test the validity of recommending these doses, a simulation of 2000 replicate “patients” was made 
by 
adding a random term (exp(ήi)) to the relationship for Cl and weight: 
 Cli  = 0.020 x (WT/40)0.43 x (exp(ήi)) 
where WT had a uniform distribution from 10 to 80 kg, and ήi had a normal distribution with a mean of 
zero and an SD of 0.5. The Css was calculated by assigning a dose of 10 mg for subjects weighing 10 
to 
20 kg, 15 mg for subjects weighing 20 to 40 kg, and 20 mg daily for subjects weighing >40 to 80 kg. 
The dosing interval in all weight groups was specified to be 24 hours. 
The  left  box-whisker  plots  below  show  that  the  Css  for  M1  in  the  JRA  population  using  the  refined 
regimens are successful in achieving similar M1 exposures as they lie within the range of M1 exposures 
observed  in  adult  RA  patients.  However  in  the  right  panel,  the  leflunomide  regimens  investigated  in 
study  3503  clearly  were  not  equivalent  for  exposure  to  M1  across  the  three  weight  groups.  Only  the      
20 mg daily maintenance dose administered to pediatric subjects weighing > 40 kg achieved systemic 
exposures comparable to those observed in adults. Consequently, the leflunomide doses prescribed for 
subjects < 20 kg and between 20 and 40 kg were possibly too low in study 3503.

Among the 47 subjects treated with leflunomide in study 3503, 32 were categorised as responders, as 
measured  by  DOI>30%,  and  15  were  categorized  as  non-responders  when  assessed  following  16 
weeks  of  treatment.  To  examine  whether  the  non-responders  had  lower  exposures  to  M1  and  were 
possibly  also  in  the  lower  weight  groups  (therefore  under-dosed),  the  model-predicted  Css based  on 
the  regimens  of  study  3503  and  individual  body  weights  were  separately  plotted  against  response 
status (i.e., responder or non-responder), one of the co-primary efficacy endpoints in study 3503. 
The left panel reveals a clear trend for lower exposures in the group of subjects who failed to respond 
to leflunomide. The majority of subjects (80%) in the non-responder group had exposures to M1 that 
were less than the median exposure in the responder group. The right panel revealed a similar but less 
pronounced trend for the non-responders to be those subjects in the lower weight groups. The 
observation that the leflunomide doses studied in the subjects who weighed less than 40 kg were sub-
optimal appears to be supported both on PK and efficacy grounds.

In conclusion, based upon the results of the population pharmacokinetics, a leflunomide target Css of 
34 µg/ml was obtained in pediatrics by a dose of 10 mg for subjects weighing 10 to 20 kg, 15 mg for 
subjects weighing 20 to 40 kg, and 20 mg daily for subjects weighing >40 to 80 kg.  
Overall discussion and benefit/risk assessment 
The  MAH  has  submitted  data  from  two  studies  conducted  in  children  with  JRA.  Study  HWA486/1037 
was  a  Phase  Ib,  open  label  study  in  subjects  who  had  previously  failed  to  respond  to,  or  were 
intolerant of, MTX therapy. Study HWA486/3503 was a Phase III, randomised, double-dummy, double-
blind study comparing leflunomide to MTX in subjects naïve to both MTX and leflunomide. Both studies 
were followed by an extension study to gather further data on the durability of efficacy over the long 
term. 
Taking into account previous studies conducted in children, and the concept paper from the CHMP on 
points  to  consider  on  clinical  investigation  of  medicinal  products  for  the  treatment  of  JIA 
(CPMP/EWP/422/04)  studies  HWA486/1037  and  HWA486/3503  were  well  designed  and  adequate 
outcome measures were used.  
The  consequence  of  the  changing  from  equivalence  study  to  a  superiority  study  was  that  the  sample 
size was re-adjusted from 240 subjects to 90 subjects. A justification of this amendment was not given 
but  it  appears  there  was  a  wish  to  stop  the  trial  (over  March  2002-  May  2003,  94  subjects  were 
recruited  whereas  another  1-2  year  would  be  needed  to  recruit  up  to  240  subjects  in  case  non-
inferiority  was  opted  for).  However,  there  was  no  mentioning  in  the  amendment  that  in  the  event 
superiority  was  not  observed,  non-inferiority  was  opted  for  only  in  the  study  report.  Further  the 
extrapolation  of  the  12.5%  non-inferiority  margin  of  percentage  change  is  questionable  and  at  least 
would have needed a justification. 
However these major methodological flaws are overruled by the results. MTX seems to be superior to 
lelflunomide after 16 weeks treatment and non-inferiority for leflunomide has not been demonstrated. 
The CHMP did not raise an objection in this respect. The methods of analyses are agreed by CHMP.  
A  well  established  and  extensive  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  was  carried  out.  The  results 
indicate that leflunomide Cl/F by weight evaluation that pediatric APC-JRA patients with body weights 
<  40  kg  have  a  reduced  clearance  (CL)  of  M1  compared  to  those  >40  kg.  A  dose  reduction  in  these 
subjects  seems  necessary  to  obtain  a  similar  exposure/steady  state  concentration.    The  population 
pharmacokinetics  analysis  indicate  that  a  leflunomide  target  Css  of  34  µg/ml  (similar  to  the  Css 
observed  in  the  adult  population)  will  be  obtained  in  pediatrics  by  a  dose  of  10  mg  for  subjects 
weighing 10 to 20 kg, 15 mg for subjects weighing 20 to 40 kg, and 20 mg daily for subjects weighing 
> 40 to 80 kg.  
Following the concept paper from the CHMP on points to consider on clinical investigation of medicinal 
products for the treatment of JIA (CPMP/EWP/422/04), dose section should be based on recommended 
dose in adults of an appropriate pharmacokinetic parameter, most commonly AUC for chronic dosing. 
Subsequently, well planned dose ranging studies should be carried out before the confirmatory clinical 
trials are undertaken. However, the guideline ICH Topic E11 Clinical investigations of medicinal 
products in the paediatric population (CHMP/ICH/2711/99) indicates that when the medicinal product 
is to be used in the paediatric population for the same indication as those studied and approved in 
adults, the disease process is similar in adults and paediatric patients, in such cases pharmacokinetic 
studies in paediatric patients together with safety studies may provide adequate information for use by 
allowing selection of paediatric doses that will produce blood levels similar to those observed in adults. 
In the case of leflunomide in children with JCA, no formal dose finding studies were conducted but on 
basis of PK analysis 5 and 10 mg regimens have been clinically tested. This approach is considered to 
be sufficient because active polyarticular course JRA is widely regarded as the paediatric equivalent to 
adult RA. But on basis of the results of the population PK analysis the chosen doses appeared to be too 
low to achieve similar Css as observed in adults.  
Disease characteristics at baseline were similar between the groups and the included patients describe 
a moderate to severe disease activity.    
The  subjects  continuing  in  study  3504  from  subjects  completing  study  3503,  20%  did  not  entered 
study 3504. No conclusion with respect to equal efficacy can be drawn.

The  two  studies  suggest  some  effect  of  leflunomide  in  the  treatment  of  JRA  in  children  who  have 
intolerance  for  MTX  or  who  are  MTX  naïve,  however,  placebo  controlled  studies  are  lacking  and  the 
efficacy  of  lelfunomide  was  lower  than  that  for  MTX.  After  16  weeks  treatment,  the  difference  in 
response rates was statistically significant in favour of MTX for the DOI ≥ 30% (p=0.02), but not for 
the PII (p=0.18). The DOI ≥ 30% responder rate and the PII achieved at Week 16 were maintained in 
both  treatment  groups  throughout  the  extension  study  3504  but  the  difference  between  treatment 
groups  for  DOI  ≥  30%  was  no  longer  statistically  significant  in  study  3504  efficacy  evaluable 
population at endpoint (Week 48) of the extension (p=0.15). The difference in efficacy favouring MTX 
was  particularly  noticeable  in  lighter  (≤  40  kg)  and  younger  (<12  years)  subjects.  Based  on  the  fact 
that  the  M1  concentration  was  lower  in  subjects  ≤  40  kg,  it  seems  that  the  lighter  subjects  were 
under-dosed compared to subjects > 40 kg. 
Taking into account that the numbers of patients that used oral corticosteroids treatments or that had 
a  positive  rheumatoid  factor  in  each  study  were  small,  based  on  subgroup  analyses  it  seems  that 
neither  the corticosteroid  co-medications  nor  the  presence  of  RF  influenced  the  efficacy  outcomes  in 
study 3503 and its extension study 3504. 
Although  it  seems  that  response  rates  observed  in  leflunomide  treated  patients  are  higher 
in comparison  to the  response  rate  values  observed  in  placebo-treated  patients,  values  of  placebo 
effects obtained from previously conducted clinical studies cannot replace a head to head comparison 
in a clinical trial designed to compare leflunomide vs. placebo. 
The pattern of adverse events of leflunomide and MTX seems to be similar. However, it is seems that 
lighter  subjects  (the  proportion  of  leflunomide  subjects  weighing  <40  kg  was  15%  larger  than  those 
weighing  >40  kg)  were  under-dosed  (compared  to  subjects  >40kg)  due  to  the  fact  that  the  M1 
concentration was lower in subjects ≤ 40 kg, and, therefore, this may also have influenced the safety 
data.  
Based  on  the  review  of  the  data  on  safety  and  efficacy  for  Arava  conducted  in  patients  with  Juvenile 
Rheumatoid Arthritis and comparing the safety and efficacy of leflunomide with that of MTX, the CHMP 
concluded  that  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  Arava  in  patients  under  18  years  age  group  was  not 
established.

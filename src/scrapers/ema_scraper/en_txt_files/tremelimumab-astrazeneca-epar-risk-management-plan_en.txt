Brief description of the 
product 
Centralised 
Chemical class: 
Tremelimumab is a human anti-CTLA-4-IgG2a monoclonal antibody. 
Summary of mode of action: 
CTLA-4 is primarily expressed on the surface of T lymphocytes. Interaction of 
CTLA-4 with its ligands, CD80 and CD86, limits effector T-cell activation, 
through a number of potential mechanisms, but primarily by limiting 
co-stimulatory signalling through CD28. Tremelimumab blocks CTLA-4 
interaction with CD80 and CD86, thus enhancing T-cell activation and 
proliferation, resulting in increased T-cell diversity and enhanced antitumour 
immune activity.  
Important information about its composition:  
Tremelimumab is expressed in a NS0 (murine myeloma) cell line. It is purified 
using 3 chromatography steps, a virus inactivation step, and a virus reduction 
filtration step.

Hepatocellular Carcinoma 
Incidence 
Primary liver cancer is a major global health problem accounting for approximately 
906,000 new cases per year globally (American Cancer Society 2021). In Europe, 
approximately 87,000 new cases a year are reported (WHO 2020), whereas the US reports 
approximately 42,000 new cases a year (American Cancer Society 2021). As of 2020, liver 
cancer was the seventh most common cancer worldwide (Sung et al 2021). 
Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common histologic type of primary liver cancer, 
accounting for around 90% of these malignancies (EASL 2018). The incidence of HCC varies 
globally due to the difference in the prevalence of risk factors across geographic regions 
(Sung et al 2021). The highest incidence rates are seen in East Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, 
while lower rates are seen in Europe and North America (WHO 2019). 
Table II-1 presents an estimated incidence of liver cancer and HCC worldwide, by region and 
gender.

Prevalence 
Using 2017 data from the GBD project, the estimated crude 1-year prevalence rate of liver 
cancer was 3.99 per 100,000 individuals in Europe (Institute for Health Metrics and 
Evaluation 2017).  
A north-south gradient was seen in the estimated age-standardised prevalence rate for HCC 
within Europe. According to the GBD 2016 project, the prevalence rate in Italy was greater 
than 12 per 100,000, while the rates were slightly lower for Austria, Germany, Luxembourg, 
and Switzerland (range: 6 to 11.99 per 100,000). In the same year, countries such as Poland 
and Hungary had prevalence rates of HCC below 5 per 100,000 (Institute for Health Metrics 
and Evaluation 2016).  
Table II-2 presents the estimated 5-year prevalence of liver cancer and HCC worldwide and

Demographics of the population in the proposed indication (age, gender, racial and/or 
ethnic origin) and risk factors for the disease 
The incidence of HCC increases progressively with advancing age in all populations, reaching 
a peak at 70 years (El Serag 2012, White et al 2017). While HCC is more common in men 
than women (2- to 3-fold higher), it is believed this is most likely due to differences in the 
behaviours associated with relevant risk factors rather than underlying risk (Llovet et al 2016, 
Sung et al 2021).  
Cirrhosis and chronic liver disease are the most important risk factors for HCC (Balogh et al 
2016, Asrani et al 2019, Janevska et al 2015). Viral hepatitis infections, alcohol abuse, and 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 
 13 of 57 
 
 
European Union Risk Management Plan 
Tremelimumab 
AstraZeneca 
Version: 2 
metabolic diseases including obesity and diabetes mellitus are all conditions that may result in 
cirrhosis and the chronic liver damage that is associated with increased risk for HCC (Balogh 
et al 2016, Asrani et al 2019, Massarweh and El-Serag 2017, Reeves et al 2016). 
Globally, chronic infections with hepatitis B or C virus are the most commonly occurring risk 
factors for HCC (Caldwell and Park 2009). Approximately 80% of HCC cases worldwide can 
be attributed to either hepatitis B or C virus (Caldwell and Park 2009). Other HCC risk factors 
include exposure to aflatoxin (Janevska et al 2015), tobacco use, and certain genetic 
conditions including Wilson disease (Balogh et al 2016). 
The main existing treatment options 
The ESMO and the European Association for the Study of the Liver 2018 guidelines 
recommend systemic therapies for the management of unresectable HCC. Since 2020, the 
NCCN, ESMO, and Japanese Society of Hepatology guidelines have recommended 
atezolizumab (a PD-L1 inhibitor) in combination with bevacizumab (an angiogenesis inhibitor 
targeting vascular endothelial growth factor A) as the preferred option to treat first-line HCC 
(NCCN 2021a, JSH 2021, Vogel and Martinelli 2021 [ie, ESMO Guidelines 2021]).  
Lenvatinib (a multiple kinase inhibitor against vascular endothelial growth factor 
receptor-1, -2, and -3 and fibroblast growth factor receptor-1, -2, -3, and -4) is also approved 
as first-line treatment for advanced HCC in patients without main portal vein invasion and a 
Performance Status of 0 to 1. 
Selective internal radiation therapy may be considered as an alternative therapy, following 
multidisciplinary board discussion, in exceptional circumstances and in a subset of patients for 
whom systemic therapy is not possible (EASL 2018, Vogel et al 2018). 
Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including 
mortality and morbidity 
The 5-year survival rate for HCC is less than 20% (Sarveazad et al 2019, Villanueva 2019), 
with a median survival following diagnosis ranging from 6 to 20 months (McGlynn et al 
2015). 
HCC is often associated with non-specific complaints. Patients typically manifest symptoms 
related to underlying cirrhosis, a condition present in 80% to 90% of patients with HCC 
(Tinkle and Haas-Kogan 2012). Rarely, patients may present with acute onset of severe 
symptoms (Rossetto et al 2010). HCC is also associated with a number of paraneoplastic 
syndromes. Extrahepatic spread at presentation is relatively uncommon, ranging between 10% 
and 30%. The most common sites of metastasis include lung, adrenal gland, regional lymph 
node and bone (El-Serag and Rudolph 2007, Tinkle and Haas-Kogan 2012).

HCC carries a substantial mortality and morbidity burden (Tinkle and Haas-Kogan 2012), 
with HCC mortality rates increasing over recent decades in most countries. As of 2020, liver 
cancer was the third most common cause of cancer-related death (Sung et al 2021). Global 
variation in mortality estimates for liver cancer, of which approximately 90% of cases are 
HCC (Mak et al 2018) can be assessed through data extracted from the GLOBOCAN series 
(Table II-3).

Untreated patients with advanced HCC, those who have macrovascular invasion or 
extrahepatic spread (lymph node involvement or metastases), have a median survival of 
6 months (Llovet et al 2008) and a 25% survival at 1-year (Cabibbo et al 2010). Patients with 
end-stage disease have a median survival of 3 to 4 months (Llovet et al 1999) and an 
11% survival at 1- year (Cabibbo et al 2010). 
Important comorbidities 
The most common liver-related comorbidities in patients with advanced HCC include 
cirrhosis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and/or non-alcoholic fatty liver 
disease, alcohol dependence, and portal vein thromboembolism (Bonafede et al 2020, Mallick 
et al 2013).  
In general, elderly patients with advanced HCC also have high incidence of comorbidities 
such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and chronic renal disease (Nishikawa et al 
2013). Hypertension, diabetes, anxiety, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease, depression, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, and chronic kidney disease are also reported 
among patients with advanced HCC (Bonafede et al 2020, Lee et al 2018, Arora et al 2016).

Incidence

Version: 2 
Worldwide data from the IARC show that lung cancer is the most common type of cancer 
diagnosed, with 2.1 million new lung cancer cases predicted in 2018 (Bray et al 2018). The 
age-adjusted incidence rate of lung cancer worldwide was 22.5 per 100000 with lower rates in 
women (14.6 per 100000) compared to men (31.5 per 100000), which may be partly attributed 
to the gender difference in tobacco use. Incidence rates (per 100000) vary geographically, 
with the highest age-adjusted incidence rate reported in the US (35 in both sexes; 40.1 in 
males; 30.8 in females), followed by Western Europe (33.9 in both sexes; 43.3 in males; 
25.7 in females). 
The incidence rates of NSCLC are highly variable and depend largely on local smoking 
prevalence. A summary of NSCLC incidence, by country, is presented in Table II-4.

Prevalence 
The IARC estimates that there will be 2129964 prevalent cases of lung cancer worldwide in 
2018. In many regions, the pattern of lung cancer prevalence rates (over 5 years) generally 
follows that of incidence rates, except for Northern Europe, North America, and the US, 
where prevalence rates for males and females are converging (Bray et al 2018). Across 
Europe, the highest prevalence was reported for Western and Northern European countries; 
84.1 and 76.0 per 100000, respectively. The prevalence of lung cancer in the US and Asia in 
the same year was 78.3 and 26.6 per 100000, respectively (Table II-5).

Males are more likely to be diagnosed with NSCLC; 60% of incident Stage IV NSCLC cases 
occur in males (Decision Resources Group 2018). Risk factors for NSCLC include tobacco, 
environmental tobacco smoke, family history of lung cancer, genetic factors, occupational 
factors and radiation risk, air pollution, and inflammation and infection.  
The main existing treatment options 
In Stage IV NSCLC, preferred first-line systemic treatments are based on the presence of 
specific molecular characteristics including activating EGFR mutations (osimertinib, afatinib, 
erlotinib, gefitinib, and dacomitinib), ALK rearrangements (alectinib, brigatinib, lorlatinib, 
ceritinib, and crizotinib), ROS1 rearrangement (entrectinib, ceritinib and crizotinib), 
BRAF V600E mutation (dabrafenib plus trametinib, and vemurafenib), NTRK gene fusion 
(larotrectinib and entrectinib), MET exon 14 skipping (capmatinib and tepotinib), and 
RET rearrangements (selpercatinib and pralsetinib) (NCCN 2021b).  
Platinum-based systemic therapy in combination with anti PD-1/PD-L1 agents (eg, 
pembrolizumab and atezolizumab) is the SoC for patients who do not have mutation positive 
tumours. Regimens containing pembrolizumab are preferred for those with tumours that 
express PD-L1. These include pembrolizumab + cisplatin/carboplatin + pemetrexed for 
adenocarcinoma and large cell subtypes, and pembrolizumab + carboplatin + paclitaxel (or 
albumin-bound paclitaxel) for squamous cell carcinoma. For patients with tumours expressing 
high levels of PD-L1 (> 50%), pembrolizumab monotherapy is an option (NCCN 2021b). 
Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including 
mortality and morbidity 
Patients with NSCLC commonly experience multiple symptoms, both lung-specific (eg, 
cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, hoarseness, and haemoptysis) and systemic (loss of 
weight or appetite, feeling tired or weak).  
There are limited inter-regional statistics on mortality for the worldwide target population. 
The highest age-adjusted mortality rate (per 100000) for lung cancer in 2018 was reported 
from Western Europe (24.6), followed by Central and Eastern Europe (23.6), and Southern 
Europe (22.7). According to data collected from SEER cancer registries in 2008 to 2014, the

5-year survival for patients diagnosed with lung cancer that has spread to distant sites is below 
5% (Siegel et al 2017). 
Important co-morbidities 
Common co-morbidities in patients with NSCLC include chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease, diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, myocardial infarction, 
congestive heart failure, renal disease, and non-lung malignancy (Nilsson et al 2017, Wang et 
al 2012, Edwards et al 2014). 
Common sequelae associated with systemic chemotherapy specifically in Stage IV NSCLC 
are reported to include dyspnoea (30% of treated patients), anaemia (26%), 
hypertension (15%), atypical pneumonia (15%), and fatigue (14%) (Bittoni et al 2018).

MODULE SII: NON-CLINICAL PART OF THE SAFETY 
SPECIFICATION 
II.2.1 
Summary of Key Findings from Non-Clinical Data 
Key safety findings from non-clinical studies and their relevance to human usage are 
described below.  
Toxicity 
•  Key issues identified from acute or repeat-dose toxicity studies:  
Gastrointestinal toxicity: In both single- and repeat-dose toxicity studies in cynomolgus 
monkeys, iv administration of tremelimumab was associated with increased incidence and 
frequency of diarrhoea or loose stools, consistent with the primary pharmacodynamics of 
tremelimumab. Histopathology changes included inflammation of the cecum and colon; 
these changes correlated with the diarrhoea and loose stools and were considered 
consistent with immune activation and, therefore, consistent with the mode of action of 
tremelimumab. All treatment related histopathology findings generally reversed or 
showed a trend towards reversibility. In conclusion, treatment of cynomolgus monkeys 
with tremelimumab in repeat dose toxicity studies resulted in the identification of the 
gastrointestinal tract as a potential target organ.  
Relevance to human use: Immune-mediated colitis (in addition to diarrhoea and intestinal 
perforation as a consequence of immune-mediated colitis) are included as ADRs in the 
tremelimumab SmPC and are categorised as important identified risks in this EU RMP 
(under the topic of immune-mediated adverse reactions; see Section II.7.3.1). 
Skin effects: In the 6-month chronic toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys, development 
of adverse skin reactions (open sores along swollen eyelids; dry, cracked, scaly, or crusty 
skin; rash or reddened skin; scabbed areas and yellowish skin) were observed, with earlier 
onset and highest incidence and severity at the 50 mg/kg high dose. At the low and 
intermediate doses, clinical signs of skin reactions generally occurred with lower 
incidence and reduced severity and resolved despite continued dosing. Histopathology 
findings included mononuclear cell inflammation in the skin that correlated with the 
observed clinical signs. These treatment-related histopathology findings were typically 
related to immune activation, and, therefore, generally consistent with the primary mode 
of action of tremelimumab. No skin effects were noted in the single dose or 4-week 
repeat-dose toxicity studies. As a result of the findings in the 6-month chronic toxicity 
study, the skin was identified a potential target organ of tremelimumab toxicity.  
Relevance to human use: Immune-mediated rash and dermatitis are included as ADRs in 
the tremelimumab SmPC, and are categorised as important identified risks in this EU 
RMP (under the topic of immune-mediated adverse reactions; see Section II.7.3.1).

Tremelimumab

Version: 2 
Liver toxicity: In the 4-week Good Laboratory Practice repeat-dose toxicity study, 
histopathology findings included non-adverse and pharmacodynamic-mediated, 
slight-to-mild, focal-to-multifocal periportal infiltration of mixed mononuclear cells in the 
liver. At the end of the treatment-free phase, these liver changes reversed in females but 
not in males. As a result, treatment of cynomolgus monkeys with tremelimumab in 
repeat-dose toxicity studies resulted in the identification of the liver as a potential target 
organ. 
Relevance to human use: Immune-mediated hepatitis is included as an ADR in the 
tremelimumab SmPC, and is categorised as an important identified risk in this EU RMP 
(under the topic of immune-mediated adverse reactions; see Section II.7.3.1). 
Mononuclear cell infiltration: In the 6-month chronic toxicity study, mononuclear cell 
infiltration was observed in the skin and hyperplasia in lymphoid tissues. A 
dose-dependent increase in the incidence and severity of mononuclear cell infiltration 
with or without mononuclear cell inflammation was observed in the salivary gland, 
pancreas (acinar), thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal, heart, oesophagus, tongue, periportal 
liver area, skeletal muscle, prostate, uterus, pituitary, eye (conjunctiva, extra ocular 
muscles), and choroid plexus of the brain.  
Relevance to human use: The presence of mononuclear infiltration across different organs 
and systems is indicative of pro-inflammatory effects, and is consistent with the mode of 
action of tremelimumab. No specific safety concerns relevant to human use have been 
identified.  
•  Reproductive/developmental toxicity: 
In an embryofoetal toxicity study, iv administration of tremelimumab from confirmation 
of pregnancy and throughout the period of organogenesis (Gestational Days 20 to 50) was 
not associated with any effects on pregnant females or foetal weights; external, visceral, 
or skeletal abnormalities; or weights of selected organs post-caesarean section. Therefore, 
tremelimumab did not elicit maternal toxicity, developmental toxicity, or teratogenicity. 
Relevance to human use: No safety concerns relevant to human usage have been 
identified. 
•  Genotoxicity: 
Tremelimumab is a large protein molecule. Genotoxicity is not applicable for large 
protein molecules that are not expected to cross the nuclear or mitochondrial membranes 
and interact directly with DNA or other chromosomal constituents. 
Relevance to human use: No safety concerns relevant to human usage have been 
identified.

A summary of exposure to IMJUDO and durvalumab treatment in patients with HCC is 
provided in Section II.3.1, and a summary of exposure to TREMELIMUMAB 
ASTRAZENECA and durvalumab (plus SoC chemotherapy) in patients with metastatic 
NSCLC is provided in Section II.3.2.  
II.3.1 
Exposure to IMJUDO + Durvalumab for HCC 
The pivotal safety dataset in support of the use of IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab 
in patients with unresectable HCC was derived from pooled data from patients who received a 
single priming dose of IMJUDO 300 mg in combination with durvalumab 1500 mg via iv 
infusion on Day 1 (Week 0) in the T300 + D arms of the HIMALAYA study (D419CC00002; 
NCT03298451) (n = 388) and Study 22 (D4190C00022; NCT02519348) (n = 74). After initial 
combination dosing, patients in both studies subsequently received durvalumab 1500 mg 
monotherapy Q4W starting 4 weeks after the first and final infusion of the combination 
therapy until confirmed disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or any discontinuation 
criterion was met. 
Exposure to IMJUDO and durvalumab in the HCC tumour pool (T300 + D) by weeks, age 
group and sex, and race is presented in Table II-8, Table II-9, and Table II-10, respectively.

Exposure to TREMELIMUMAB ASTRAZENECA + Durvalumab + 
SoC Chemotherapy for NSCLC 
The pivotal dataset in support of the use of TREMELIMUMAB ASTRAZENECA in 
combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy (SoC) for the first-line 
treatment of metastatic NSCLC was derived from the T + D + SoC chemotherapy arm of the 
POSEIDON study (D419MC00004; NCT03164616), in which durvalumab 1500 mg plus 
TREMELIMUMAB ASTRAZENECA 75 mg was administered via iv infusion concurrently 
with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (either abraxane or gemcitabine or pemetrexed 
[dependent on NSCLC histology] plus cisplatin or carboplatin) Q3W for 4 cycles 
(1 cycle = 3 weeks). Post-chemotherapy, durvalumab monotherapy (plus pemetrexed 
maintenance treatment unless contraindicated, based on investigator discretion] for 
participants with non-squamous tumours who had previously received chemotherapy with 
pemetrexed plus carboplatin/cisplatin) was continued Q4W until disease progression or

MODULE SIV: POPULATIONS NOT STUDIED IN CLINICAL 
TRIALS 
Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Studies Within the Development 
Programme 
•  Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medications (with some specific exceptions) 
prior to starting study treatment  
–  Reason for exclusion: Systemic immunosuppressive medication pharmacologically 
impacts the different components of both the humoral and cell-mediated responses of 
the immune system. The impact on T-cells may interfere with the mechanism of 
action of tremelimumab. 
– 
Is it considered to be included as missing information: No 
–  Rationale: Experience to date has indicated that treatment with tremelimumab has 
been well tolerated by patients receiving short-term physiological and high doses of 
systemic corticosteroids. Given the mechanism of action of immunotherapy agents, 
the continued, long-term use of other concomitant immunosuppressive medications 
for concurrent underlying medical conditions in the target population is not 
anticipated; therefore, this criterion is not relevant for inclusion as missing 
information. 
•  Patients with pre-existing autoimmune disease  
–  Reason for exclusion: Tremelimumab, by disrupting immune checkpoint function, 
can disturb mechanisms of immunologic tolerance that normally limit immune 
responses to healthy tissues, potentially leading to autoimmune-like/inflammatory 
side-effects or interference with down-regulation of immune responses to injury of 
normal tissue due to other causes (Naidoo et al 2015). Consequently, tremelimumab 
has the potential to exacerbate underlying autoimmune diseases in patients who 
already have a diminished mechanism of immunologic tolerance. 
– 
Is it considered to be included as missing information: No 
–  Rationale: The possible risk to patients with pre-existing autoimmune disease is 
common to all immunotherapy agents (and as such is familiar to prescribers) and is 
sufficiently managed through the SmPC, which states that this population has not 
been studied. Further characterisation of this population is therefore neither feasible 
nor warranted, and as such, this criterion is not relevant for inclusion as missing 
information.

Tremelimumab

•  Untreated CNS metastatic disease, leptomeningeal disease, or cord compression  
–  Reason for exclusion: Patients with these conditions have significantly worse 
prognoses and were excluded from the clinical development program to ensure the 
interpretability of efficacy. However, patients with stable CNS metastases were not 
excluded from tremelimumab clinical trials. 
– 
Is it considered to be included as missing information: No 
–  Rationale: Based on the mechanism of action of tremelimumab, components of the 
immune system (eg, T cells) are capable of crossing the blood brain barrier and can 
possibly exert an antitumour response. Consequently, this population was excluded 
for concerns regarding efficacy, not safety. No evidence of a different safety profile 
in patients with stable CNS metastases has been evident in the clinical development 
programme to date, and the further investigation of tremelimumab in patients with 
untreated metastatic CNS disease, leptomeningeal disease, or cord compression is not 
feasible due to the poor prognosis in this patient population. Consequently, this 
criterion is not relevant for inclusion as missing information. 
•  Paediatric and adolescent patients < 18 years of age 
–  Reason for exclusion: This population was excluded from the tremelimumab clinical 
trial program based on the general principle that paediatric patients are not exposed to 
the investigational product where the benefit-risk profile for the intended adult 
population has not yet been established. 
– 
Is it considered to be included as missing information: No 
–  Rationale: NSCLC is a disease of adults, with only exceptional occurrence in the 
paediatric population (Dishop and Kuruvilla 2008). Consequently, use in paediatric 
and adolescent patients is not anticipated for the proposed target indication, and 
therefore this population is not relevant for inclusion as missing information. 
•  Females who are pregnant or lactating 
–  Reason for exclusion: It is unknown whether tremelimumab is secreted in human 
milk, and pregnant and lactating females were therefore excluded from clinical 
studies to avoid potential harm to the unborn foetus or breastfeeding newborn. 
– 
Is it considered to be included as missing information: No 
–  Rationale: The SmPC recommends tremelimumab not be used during pregnancy or 
lactation. Use in this population is therefore not anticipated and consequently not 
relevant for consideration as missing information.

•  Patients with active primary immunodeficiency  
–  Reason for exclusion: Tremelimumab treatment may not be effective due to 
underlying immune deficiency. 
– 
Is it considered to be included as missing information: No 
–  Rationale: The safety profile of tremelimumab in this population is not expected to be 
any different than in the general intended population, as immune checkpoint 
inhibitors can only alter existing immune mechanisms. Consequently, this criterion is 
not relevant for inclusion as missing information. 
•  Patients with pre-existing active infection / co-infection including tuberculosis, hepatitis 
B, hepatitis C, or HIV 
–  Reason for exclusion: PD-L1 or CTLA-4 blockade could lead to an initial 
exacerbation of the underlying infectious disease or systemic inflammatory response. 
– 
Is it considered to be included as missing information: No 
–  Rationale: The safety profile of this population may differ to that of the general target 
population as there is the potential for an increased risk of exacerbation of the 
underlying infectious disease or systemic inflammatory response; however, these are 
risks with all immunotherapy agents, and consequently prescribers are familiar with 
this concept. The possible risk to patients is consequently sufficiently managed 
through the SmPC, which states that this population has not been studied. Further 
characterisation is therefore neither feasible nor warranted, and as such, this criterion 
is not relevant for inclusion as missing information. 
•  Patients receiving live attenuated vaccination within 30 days prior to study entry or 
within 30 days of receiving study treatment 
–  Reason for exclusion: This population is excluded due to concern of live attenuated 
vaccine complications. PD-1/PD-L1 or CTLA-4 blockade could lead to more 
vigorous inflammation. In analogy, immune reconstitution in HIV patients was 
associated with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine complications (Nuttall et al 2008). 
– 
Is it considered to be included as missing information: No 
–  Rationale: The safety profile of this population may differ to that of the general target 
population as there is the potential for an increased risk of inflammation and/or 
vaccine complications; however, these are risks with all immunotherapy agents, and 
consequently prescribers are familiar with this concept. The possible risk to patients 
is consequently sufficiently managed through the SmPC, which states that this 
population has not been studied. Further characterisation is therefore neither feasible

II.7.1 
Identification of Safety Concerns in the Initial RMP Submission 
II.7.1.1  Risks Not Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns 
in the RMP 
The reasons for not including an identified or potential risk in the list of safety concerns in the 
RMP (Version 1) are presented below: 
•  Known risks that require no further characterisation and are followed up via routine 
pharmacovigilance namely through signal detection and adverse reaction reporting, and 
for which the risk minimisation messages in the product information are adhered by 
prescribers (eg, actions being part of standard clinical practice in each EU Member state 
where the product is authorised): 
−  Infusion-related reactions. 
•  Risks with minimal clinical impact on patients (in relation to the severity of the indication 
treated):  
-  Abdominal pain, Arthralgia, Cough/productive cough, Cystitis noninfective, 
Dysphonia, Dysuria, Myalgia, Night sweats, Peripheral oedema, Pruritus, and Pyrexia. 
•  Known risks that do not impact the risk-benefit profile: 
−  Dental and oral soft tissue infections, Diabetes insipidus, Influenza, Oral candidiasis, 
Meningitis, Pneumonia, and Upper respiratory tract infections. 
•  Adverse reactions with clinical consequences, even serious, but occurring with a low 
frequency and considered to be acceptable in relation to the severity of the indication 
treated:  
−  Amylase increased, ALT increased, AST increased, Lipase increased, and Blood 
creatinine increased. 
II.7.1.2  Risks Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns in 
the RMP 
The following topic was classified as an important identified risk for tremelimumab at the 
time of initial EU RMP approval:  
• 
Immune-mediated adverse reactions 
−  Risk benefit impact: In tremelimumab clinical trials, double check-point inhibition 
with tremelimumab plus durvalumab (a PD-L1 inhibitor) exhibited a higher overall 
toxicity in relation to immune-mediated adverse reactions in the target patient 
population versus durvalumab alone. Although the incidence of severe 
immune-mediated adverse reactions was low, these events can be potentially serious

or life-threatening for the individual patient, and require careful monitoring, early 
recognition, timely intervention (by withholding/discontinuation of tremelimumab), 
and appropriate medical intervention, including systemic corticosteroids.  
There were no important potential risks or areas of missing information.

Details of Important Identified Risks, Important Potential Risks and 
Missing Information 
II.7.3.1 
Presentation of Important Identified Risks and Important Potential Risks 
Important Identified Risk: Immune-mediated Adverse Reactions 
Potential mechanisms 
Tremelimumab specifically blocks CTLA-4 interaction with CD80 and CD86, thus enhancing 
T-cell activation and proliferation, resulting in increased T-cell diversity. Consequently, as 
tremelimumab significantly enhances cytotoxic T-cells throughout the body, autoimmune 
toxicity can arise due off-target effects of an excessively activated immune system.  
The spectrum of organ systems affected by immune-mediated adverse reactions is very broad, 
and as such toxicities can affect almost any organ. 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence  
The development of immune-mediated adverse reactions is consistent with the anti-CTLA-4 
drug class (Quirk et al 2015).  
In tremelimumab clinical trials, double check-point inhibition with tremelimumab plus 
durvalumab (a PD-L1 inhibitor) exhibited a higher overall toxicity in relation to immune-
mediated adverse reactions in the target patient population versus durvalumab alone. 
Characterisation of the risk 
This risk is characterised in Table II-15 (immune-mediated pneumonitis), Table II-16 
(immune-mediated hepatic events), Table II-17 (immune-mediated GI events), 
Table II-18 (immune-mediated endocrinopathies), Table II-19 (immune-mediated renal 
events), Table II-20 (immune-mediated skin events), and Table II-21 (other immune-mediated 
events). Note: Data in these tables are derived from adverse events programmatically 
adjudicated as immune-mediated by a pre-specified algorithm.

Risk factors and risk groups  
AstraZeneca 
Version: 2 
Risk factors for immune-mediated adverse reactions associated with CTLA-4 inhibition are 
unknown. It is conceivable that any pre-existing immune conditions in any organ system 
could be risk factors for tremelimumab immune-mediated adverse reactions. 
Preventability 
As described in the tremelimumab SmPC and PL, careful monitoring for signs and symptoms 
of immune-mediated adverse reactions, withholding/discontinuation of tremelimumab, and 
provision of appropriate medical intervention, including systemic corticosteroids, are 
performed to help prevent further complications. 
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product 
Severe immune-mediated adverse reactions, if not recognised or managed appropriately, can 
become life-threatening or fatal, which can impact the benefit-risk of tremelimumab. 
Public health impact 
There is no potential public health impact beyond that within the treated population.

Patient Card 
Objectives 
To ensure patients and carers are aware of the symptoms of immune-mediated adverse 
reactions and understand the importance of early detection and prompt action. 
Rationale for the additional risk minimisation activity 
Appropriate recognition and management of immune-mediated adverse reactions can avoid 
worsening to life-threatening or fatal complications. Raising awareness of potential symptoms 
of immune-mediated adverse reactions will promote early detection and facilitate prompt 
management; this will reduce the clinical impact of immune-mediated adverse reactions. 
Target audience and planned distribution path 
Information will be made available to patients and carers in a manner appropriate to each 
market in which AstraZeneca launches tremelimumab and in accordance with local regulatory 
requirements.

Summary of risk management plan for IMJUDO™ / 
TREMELIMUMAB ASTRAZENECA (tremelimumab) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for IMJUDO / TREMELIMUMAB 
ASTRAZENECA (tremelimumab). The RMP details important risks of IMJUDO / 
TREMELIMUMAB ASTRAZENECA, how these risks can be minimised, and how more 
information will be obtained about IMJUDO / TREMELIMUMAB ASTRAZENECA’s risks 
and uncertainties (missing information). 
IMJUDO / TREMELIMUMAB ASTRAZENECA’s Summary of Product Characteristics 
(SmPC) and its Package Leaflet (PL) give essential information to healthcare professionals 
and patients on how IMJUDO / TREMELIMUMAB ASTRAZENECA should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for IMJUDO / TREMELIMUMAB ASTRAZENECA should be 
read in the context of all this information including the assessment report of the evaluation and 
its plain-language summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report 
(EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of the 
IMJUDO / TREMELIMUMAB ASTRAZENECA RMP. 
VI.1 
The medicine and what it is used for 
IMJUDO / TREMELIMUMAB ASTRAZENECA is authorised:  
• 
In combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy for the first-line 
treatment of adults with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with no 
sensitising epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations or anaplastic lymphoma 
kinase (ALK) positive mutations (under the tradename TREMELIMUMAB 
ASTRAZENECA); and  
• 
In combination with durvalumab for the first-line treatment of adults with advanced or 
unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (under the tradename IMJUDO). 
It contains tremelimumab as the active substance and it is given by intravenous infusion. 
Further information about the evaluation of IMJUDO / TREMELIMUMAB 
ASTRAZENECA’s benefits can be found in IMJUDO / TREMELIMUMAB 
ASTRAZENECA’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA 
website, under the medicine’s webpage.

Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or 
further characterise the risks 
Important risks of IMJUDO / TREMELIMUMAB ASTRAZENECA, together with measures 
to minimise such risks and the proposed studies for learning more about IMJUDO / 
TREMELIMUMAB ASTRAZENECA’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of IMJUDO / TREMELIMUMAB ASTRAZENECA, these measures are 
supplemented with additional risk minimisation measures mentioned under relevant important 
risks below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) assessment, so that 
immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities. 
VI.2.1 
List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of IMJUDO / TREMELIMUMAB ASTRAZENECA are risks that need 
special risk management activities to further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the 
medicinal product can be safely administered. Important risks can be regarded as identified or 
potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use 
of IMJUDO / TREMELIMUMAB ASTRAZENECA. Potential risks are concerns for which 
an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information 
refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs 
to be collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

Summary of important risks 
A summary of the important identified risk of immune-mediated adverse reactions is provided 
in Table VI-2. 
Table VI-2 
Important Identified Risk: Immune-mediated Adverse Reactions 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine  
The development of immune-mediated adverse reactions is consistent with the 
anti-CTLA-4 drug class. 
In IMJUDO / TREMELIMUMAB ASTRAZENECA clinical trials, double 
check-point inhibition with IMJUDO / TREMELIMUMAB ASTRAZENECA 
plus durvalumab (a PD-L1 inhibitor) exhibited a higher overall toxicity in 
relation to immune-mediated adverse reactions in the target patient population 
versus durvalumab alone. 
Risk factors and risk groups  Risk factors specific for immune-mediated adverse reactions associated with 
CTLA-4 inhibition are unknown. It is conceivable that any pre-existing immune 
conditions in any organ system could be risk factors for IMJUDO / 
TREMELIMUMAB ASTRAZENECA immune-mediated adverse reactions.

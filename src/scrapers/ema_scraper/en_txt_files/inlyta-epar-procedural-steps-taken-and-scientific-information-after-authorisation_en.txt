An analysis on pooled pharmacokinetic data from a total 
information on CYP1A2 induction by smoking further 
results of a population pharmacokinetic modelling 
analysis of the evaluation of the effect of smoking on 
axitinib pharmacokinetics. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

data 
210 subject was performed. Among these, there were 83 
(39.5 %) current smokers and 56 (26.7 %) ex-smokers. 
The analysis did not indicate any clinically significant effect 
of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of axitinib. Thus, 
based on the currently available evidence, the CHMP 
agreed that it is not justified to recommend any dose 
modifications for axinitib in patients who are smokers.

Update of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC in order

SmPC and PL 
In a controlled clinical study with axitinib (N = 359) for the 
to add "cardiac failure events" as a new adverse drug 
treatment of patients with RCC, cardiac failure events were 
reaction reported with a frequency “common” 
following a routine review of the MAH's safety 
database. The Package Leaflet is proposed to be 
updated accordingly. The MAH also took the 
opportunity to make minor editorial changes to the 
SmPC and Package leaflet. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
reported in 1.7 % patients receiving axitinib, including 
cardiac failure (0.6%), cardiopulmonary failure (0.6%), left 
ventricular dysfunction (0.3%), and right ventricular failure 
(0.3%). Grade 4 cardiac failure adverse reactions were 
reported in 0.6 % of patients receiving axitinib. Fatal 
cardiac failure was reported in 0.6 % of patients receiving 
axitinib.  
In monotherapy studies with axitinib (N = 672) for the 
treatment of patients with RCC, cardiac failure events 
(including cardiac failure, cardiac failure congestive, 
Page 6/8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cardiopulmonary failure, left ventricular dysfunction, 
ejection fraction decreased, and right ventricular failure) 
were reported in 1.8% patients receiving axitinib. Grade 
3/4 cardiac failure events were reported in 1.0% patients 
and fatal cardiac failure events were reported in 0.3% 
patients receiving axitinib. 
Signs or symptoms of cardiac failure should periodically be 
monitored throughout treatment with axitinib. Management 
of cardiac failure events may require temporary 
interruption or permanent discontinuation and/or dose 
reduction of axitinib therapy.

SmPC and PL 
Based on the post-marketing data and the known 
Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC in order to include 
glossodynia as an adverse reaction. In addition 
section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated with the 
frequencies of the adverse drug reactions as it was 
requested by the CHMP further to the assessment of 
the PSUR 1. The MAH took also the opportunity to 
make minor changes in section 4.8 based on the post 
marketing experience. Finally the MAH made one 
minor change in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
The Package Leaflet was updated accordingly. 
C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested 
following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a 
PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under Article 
45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - 
Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the 
association of glossodynia to other VEGFR inhibitors, a 
causal relationship to axitinib is at least a reasonable 
possibility, and therefore section 4.8 of the SmPC was 
updated to include it.  
Following the CHMP recommendation further to the 
assessment of the PSUR 1, the frequencies of the adverse 
drug reactions (ADRs) in the section of 4.8 of the SmPC 
were updated to reflect the new safety data cut-off date (1 
June 2012) and reported according to treatment emergent, 
all-causality frequency.  
The MAH took also the opportunity to consolidate the ADRs 
included under “Gastrointestinal perforation and fistula” in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC in order to improve the readability 
of the adverse drug reactions table and to align adverse 
drug reaction terms used in the Core Data Sheet (CDS) and 
SmPC, to add the ADR “hyperbilirubinaemina” and to delete 
the ADR “blood bilirubin increased”.

Finally, the MAH made a minor change in section 4.2 of the

clarify the optional nature of the dose titration.

strengths 3mg and 7 mg of axitinib in addition to the 
and PL 
currently approved 1mg and 5 mg tablets. The proposed

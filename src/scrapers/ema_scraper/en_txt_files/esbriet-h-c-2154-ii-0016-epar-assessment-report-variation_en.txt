2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Esbriet  (pirfenidone)  an  immunosuppressant,  is  indicated  in  adults  for  the  treatment  of  mild  to 
moderate  idiopathic  Pulmonary  Fibrosis  (IPF).  The  mechanism  of  action  of  pirfenidone  has  not  been 
fully  established.  However,  existing  data  suggest  that  pirfenidone  exerts  both  antifibrotic  and  anti-
inflammatory properties. 
Esbriet  is  an  Orphan  product  which  was  granted  a  marketing  authorization  in  the  EU  through  the 
Centralised procedure on 28 February 2011. As of 27 February 2013, Esbriet is commercially available 
in Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Norway, and Sweden. 
Esbriet is available through special sales in Spain. 
The recommended dose of Esbriet is one 267-mg capsule taken orally with food, three times per day 
(801 mg) (TID). The dose is gradually increased to three capsules three times per day over the first 14 
days of treatment to the recommended maintenance dose of 2403 mg/day. 
In  April  2012,  in  response  to  Esbriet  PSUR  1,  the  European  Medicines  Agency  (EMA)  requested  that 
blood  dyscrasias  be  included  in  the  Risk  Management  Plan  (RMP)  as  an  important  potential  risk  and 
this  is  being  monitored  by  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH).  The  fourth  Esbriet  Periodic 
Safety Update report (PSUR) was submitted to the EMA on 27 April 2013. That included all suspected 
Adverse  Drug  Reactions  (ADR)  reports  received  by  the  Drug  Safety  Risk  Management  (DSRM) 
department at the MAH from 01 September 2012 through 27 February 2013.  
The  initial  scope  of  the    type  II  variation  is  to  update  Section  4.8  of  the  Summary  of  Product 
Characteristics  (SmPC)  to  add  “agranulocytosis”  following  a  spontaneous  case  report  (MCN 
201306IM003639) received by the MAH from Canada in June 2013 following post-marketing data.  
In clinical trials and post-market surveillance, patients treated with pirfenidone have not demonstrated 
any  significant  evidence  of  neutropenia.  Chemotoxic  agents  associated  with  neutropenia  such  as 
antineoplastic  drugs,  typically  show  frequency  and  intensity  of  neutropenia  increasing  with  length  of 
exposure  to  the  drug.  Pirfenidone  does  not  exhibit  this  pattern  as  will  be  described  in  greater  detail 
below. 
The updated SmPC and PL submitted with this variation includes the proposed updated information for 
which  were  assessed  in  parallel  in  the  responses  submission  for  PSUR  5.  In  the  PSUR  5  the  MAH 
provided  a  review  of  angioedema/anaphylaxis  which  described  14  cases  of  angioedema  (two  initially 
reported  as  anaphylaxis  and  1  initially  reported  as  Stevens-Johnson  Syndrome,  with  all  3  considered 
more likely to be cases of angioedema). All but one of these 14 cases was considered serious, 7 cases 
involved positive dechallenge and 2 cases involved positive rechallenge. On the basis of this review the 
MAH proposes to update product information to include ‘angioedema’ as an uncommonly reported ADR 
(with consequential changes to the Patient Leaflet). In view of the potentially life-threatening nature of 
these  events  and  the  available  data  regarding  reports  of  angioedema  associated  with  use  of 
pirfenidone, the PRAC agreed that changes to the product information were warranted.  
A revised RMP incorporating the changes requested by following PSUR 5 assessment was submitted in 
May 2014 with the PSUR 6.

2.2.  Clinical Safety aspects  
2.2.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
The  MAH’s  clinical  development  programme  for  pirfenidone  in  IPF  comprises  13  clinical  studies 
sponsored  by  the  MAH.  Across  studies  included  as  part  of  the  pirfenidone  clinical  development 
programme,  1885  patients  or  subjects  have  received  study  drug,  of  whom  1175  have  received 
pirfenidone.  Overall  334  healthy  volunteers  and  1551  patients  have  participated  in  the  MAH’s 
pirfenidone clinical programme.  
The  MAH  presented  clinical  trial  data  from  the  two  placebo  controlled  trials  PIPF-004  and  PIPF-006 
(referred  to  as  the  CAPACITY  Studies)  conducted  for  a  minimum  of  72  weeks  that  treated  a  total  of 
779  patients  comparing  placebo  (347  patients)  to  either  a  low  dose  of  pirfenidone  (1197  mg/d;  87 
patients) or the approved dose of pirfenidone (2403 mg/d; 345 patients).  
In  the  most  recent  PSUR  reporting  period  (31  August  2012  to  27  February  2013),  the  greatest 
percentage  of  ADR  reports  are  being  identified  from  solicited  reporting  from  the  post-authorisation 
safety  study  (PASSPORT)  (31.7%  -  195/615)  and  the  Named  Patient  Programme  (NPP)  in  Europe 
(32.4% - 199/615) followed by spontaneous reports from Europe and Canada (18.4% - 113/615). This 
represents  a  shift  from  the  previous  PSUR  periods  where  a  majority of  the  ADR  reports  originated  in 
Japan. 
A post-authorisation safety study involving patients who receive commercial Esbriet, PASSPORT (PIPF-
025),  enrolled  its  first  patient  on  16  February  2012  and  has  an  enrolment  of  413  patients  as  of  13 
August 2013. 
2.2.2.  Results 
Clinical Trial Data 
The  MAH  presented  clinical  trial  data  from  the  two  placebo  controlled  trials  PIPF-004  and  PIPF-006 
(referred  to  as  the  CAPACITY  Studies)  and  stated  there  were  a  few  instances  of  neutropenia  in  the 
pirfenidone treated patients (Figure 1), one patient at 72 weeks in the 1197 mg/d dose group and one 
patient  at 60  weeks in  the  2403  mg/d  dose  group with  Grade  2  neutropenia,  in  addition  to  1 patient 
with  Grade  3  at  week  4  in  the  2403  mg/d  dose  group.  The  fourth  patient  was  neutropenic  prior  to 
receiving study drug. These laboratory abnormalities did not result in reported AEs at any single time 
point.Figure 1: CAPACITY Patients with Neutropenia ≥ Grade 2 (0-84 weeks) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/127991/2014 
Page 4/14 
  
  
In  the  ongoing  study  PIPF-012,  the  long  term open label  follow  up  study that  enrolled  a  total of  603 
patients all of whom received the currently approved dose of pirfenidone (2403 mg/d), the frequencies 
of patients with either Grade 2 or 3 neutropenia was less than 1% out to 180 weeks (Figure 2). There 
were  no  events  of  Grade  4  neutropenia.  The  patients  with  Grade  3  neutropenia  beyond  108  weeks 
were  individual  cases  with  no  evidence  to  support  a  causal  association.  There  was  one  report  of 
pancytopenia with mildly low platelets, anaemia, and leucopenia (MCN201203IM002441) in PIPF-012; 
however,  this  patient  had  been  on  pirfenidone  for  more  than  3  years  before  the  hematologic 
abnormalities occurred. A bone marrow biopsy did not reveal any lymphoproliferative disorder and was 
negative for high grade myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), although, low grade MDS could not be ruled 
out.  After  pirfenidone  discontinuation,  the  patient  was  diagnosed  with  iron  deficiency  anaemia,  the 
platelet count remained in the low normal range, and leucopenia continued. Furthermore, to date there 
were no SAE reports of neutropenia in PIPF-012.

The  MAH  stated  that  a  similar  pattern  is  seen  in  treated  patients  in  another  Company  sponsored 
placebo  controlled  clinical  study  (designated  as  ASCEND  or  PIPF-016)  conducted  to  support  the 
registration in the United States. In this study, a total of 555 patients were randomized 1:1 to either 
placebo  or  2403  mg/d  pirfenidone  (Figure  3).  Since  this  blinded  trial  is  ongoing,  the  available  safety 
data  combine  placebo  and  pirfenidone  treated  patients.  However,  the  overall  implication  is  similar  to 
PIPF-12 in that no duration associated neutropenia is occurring in this blinded patient population. 
Figure 3: PIPF-016 Neutropenia ≥ Grade 2 (0-52 weeks) 
Of the 8 cases of neutropenia (5/848 patients in clinical studies and 3 cases reported spontaneously or 
from solicited reporting sources; 3700 exposed patients minimum) at least 4 had significant 
confounding factors to account for this observation; including chemotherapy for malignancy (2 cases) 
or /myeloproliferative disease (1 case) and Crohn’s disease (1 case). A fifth patient without any 
obvious confounding factors had a single episode of neutropenia reported at Week 4 but continued on 
pirfenidone for another ~ 1.75 years without further neutropenia reported. 
In addition and discounting the obvious confounding factors such as malignancy/chemotherapy, the 
overall frequency of neutropenia of approximately 0.2% (8/4548; rare) of patients exposed to 
pirfenidone is similar to the overall background rate of neutropenia in the elderly population. The 
trigger event for the discussion of neutropenia was an event of agranulocytosis received in the post-
marketing period. The MAH believed that agranulocytosis represents a rare and idiosyncratic effect of 
pirfenidone administration. There is no pattern of increasing neutropenia with continuing 
administration of pirfenidone and all the cases identified in controlled clinical trials were significantly 
confounded. Consequently, the MAH believes that the data do not support listing neutropenia as an 
ADR in the SmPC.

The frequency of neutropenia in clinical studies was 21/848 patients exposed to pirfenidone, which is 
approximately  2.5%.  The  MAH  maintains  this  frequency  of  neutropenia  was  consistent  with  the

Page 7/14 
 
 
  
  
background  rate  of  neutropenia  in  a  healthy  population  of  this  age  but  cited  studies  which  gave  a 
range  of  WBC  and  ANC  values  in  healthy  American-born  women  of  African  descent  and  European 
descent,  and  women  from  Barbados/Trinidad-Tobago;  Dominican  Republic,  Haiti,  and  Jamaica,  or  in 
the  various  ethnicities  in  the  US  population.  It  is  therefore  not  clear  which  ANC  values  the  MAH 
considers are comparable to those seen in the pirfendione clinical development programme or whether 
similar  patients  to  those  described  in  these  publications  were  exposed  in  the  clinical  trials  for 
pirfenidone (which were conducted in several countries). 
Post Marketing Data 
The  MAH  presented  data  collection  programs  such  as  the  Named  Patient  Program  (NPP),  PIPF-025 
post-authorization  safety  study  (PASSORT),  and  the  post-marketing  surveillance  program  (SMPS)  in 
Japan from Shionogi & Co. Ltd. to be taken into account for calculation of patient exposure numbers. 
In these programs, an approximate 1800 subjects from NPP, 500 from PASSPORT, and 1400 from the 
SPMS program for a total of 3700 additional subjects can be added to the total program subjects. This 
would  yield  a  total  exposure  of  4875  subjects  (1175  clinical  +  3700  solicited).  This  would  make  the 
frequency  less  than  1:1000  and  be  appropriate  for  the  rare  category  (~2  agranulocytosis/4875 
subjects). In addition, for pirfenidone, a preponderance of the patient event reporting is coming from 
solicited  reporting  with  the  cumulative  adverse  reaction  load  being  2054  (66.8%)  ADRs  coming  from 
solicited reporting (see PSUR 5 Section 7.3 - Cumulative and Interval Summary Tabulations from Post-
Marketing  Data  Sources).  This  suggests  that  more  intensive  surveillance  for  pirfenidone  (Esbriet)  is 
occurring  and  that  a typical  “worst  value  estimate” using  the  3X  estimation  from  the  SmPC  guideline 
would  be  too  high.  Following  request  to  the  MAH  to  justify  the  chosen  frequency,  the  MAH  proposed 
continuing  to  use  “rare”  as  the  frequency  for  agranulocytosis  in  4.8  for  the  following  reasons  which 
were  endorsed  by  the  CHMP;  MAH  contends  solicited  data  collection  programs  such  as  the  Named 
Patient  Program  (NPP),  PIPF-025  post-authorization safety  study  (PASSORT),  and  the  post-marketing 
surveillance program (SMPS) in Japan from Shionogi & Co. Ltd. should also be taken into account for 
calculation of patient exposure numbers. In these programs, an approximate 1800 subjects from NPP, 
500 from PASSPORT, and 1400 from the SPMS program for a total of 3700 additional subjects can be 
added to the total program subjects. This would yield a total exposure of 4875 subjects (1175 clinical 
+  3700  solicited).  This  would  make  the  frequency  less  than  1:1000  and  be  appropriate  for  the  rare 
category  (~2  agranulocytosis/4875  subjects).  In  addition,  for  pirfenidone,  a  preponderance  of  the 
patient  event  reporting  is  coming  from  solicited  reporting  with  the  cumulative  adverse  reaction  load 
being 2054 (66.8%) ADRs coming from solicited reporting (see PSUR 5 Section 7.3 - Cumulative and 
Interval  Summary  Tabulations  from  Post-Marketing Data  Sources).  This  suggests  that  more intensive 
surveillance for pirfenidone (Esbriet) is occurring and that a typical “worst value estimate” using the 3X 
estimation from the SmPC guideline would be too high. Therefore, the MAH proposes continuing to use 
“rare” as the frequency for agranulocytosis. 
In  the  post-market  period,  only  two  events  of  neutropenia  have  been  reported  in  the  pirfenidone 
safety  database  (MCN  201111IM002188  and 200708IM000319).  In  the  first  case  from  Shionogi &  Co 
in  Japan,  the  patient  recovered  from  neutropenia  while  remaining  on  Pirespa  (pirfenidone).  In  the 
second  case,  the  patient  was  receiving  pirfenidone  for  treatment  of  neurofibromatosis  in  an 
investigator  sponsored  clinical  trial.  Maximum  grade  in  that  case  was  grade  2.  There  have  been  five 
events  of  WBC  decreased 
in 
the  pirfenidone  safety  database 
(MCN  201306IM003639, 
201107IM002026, 200906IM000271, 201001IM000925, 200912IM000837). Four of these events were 
from Pirespa reporting in the Shionogi Post Marketing Surveillance Program (SPMS) in Japan and were 
non-serious  with  only  limited  information  available  with  the  exception  of  MCN200906IM000271.  The 
patient  in  that  case  has  a  complex  history  including  diabetes,  pneumonia,  and  use  of  hemoperfusion

treatment that may have contributed to the event. In all there is no evidence of a signal of neutropenia 
in the post-marketing setting. 
Late-breaking information 
The  MAH  stated  that  a  case  of  potential  anaphylaxis/angioedema  was  reported  after  the  close  of  the 
data collection period of this PSUR. In this case, a 55-year-old female patient with end stage IPF in the 
United  Kingdom  started  receiving  pirfenidone  in  August  2013  (MCN  201308IM004069).  Concomitant 
medication  included  hormone  replacement  therapy  and  N-acetylcysteine.  Approximately  two  weeks 
after Esbriet was started, Esbriet dosage was increased to 534 mg three times daily (1602 mg daily). 
The patient began experiencing symptoms (not detailed) that prompted discontinuation of pirfenidone. 
Three  days  later,  the  patient  woke  up  with  facial  swelling,  lip  and  posterior  tongue  swelling.  The 
patient  also  had  shortness  of  breath,  right  sided  chest  pain,  nausea,  and  vomiting.  Symptoms  were 
partially  relieved  by  chlorpheniramine  given  at  home.  The  patient  went  to  the  hospital  and  was 
hypotensive  (blood  pressure  60-70  systolic)  and  was  further  treated  with  intravenous  hydrocortisone 
and  intramuscular  adrenaline  x2.  Swelling  improved  further  but  was  not  completely  resolved.  She 
became  progressively  hypoxic  and  short  of  breath  and  was  admitted  to  the  intensive  care  unit. 
Approximately  one  month  after  starting  Esbriet  and  ten  days  after  the  report  of  anaphylaxis,  the 
patient died. The cause of death was thought to be acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
(AE-IPF).  No  autopsy  or  lung  biopsy  was  performed.  The  reporter  considered  anaphylaxis  unlikely. 
According to the reporter, angioedema was the diagnosis. An analysis of the safety database to review 
these events is ongoing.  
This  case  was  reported  directly  to  the  MHRA’s  Yellow  Card  database  and  in  the  narrative  it  is  stated 
that the diagnosis of angioedema was a diagnosis of exclusion, confirmed by low levels of complement 
component  3  (C3)  0.46  g/L  (normal  range:  0.88-2)  and  component  4  (C4)  0.08  g/L  (normal  range: 
0.16-0.47). 
The cumulative summary tabulations capture 1 serious case of anaphylaxis reported during the review 
period  (bringing  the  cumulative  total  to  2  cases)  and  1  serious  case  of  angioedema  reported  during 
this  period  of  review  but  no  further  details  or  discussion  of  these  cases  is  provided.  It  is  not  known 
whether the late-breaking information described above is included amongst these reports. 
One  additional  case of  anaphylactic  reaction  has  been  reported  directly  the  MHRA  through  the  Yellow 
card  database,  describing  events  which  occurred  after  the  submission  date  of  this  PSUR.  This 
concerned  a  69–year-old male  patient  who  (at the end  of  October  2013) took  1  dose in  the  morning 
and  a  further  dose  at  lunchtime.  The  patient’s  tongue  started  to  tingle,  by  4pm  their  tongue  was 
swollen, and at 10pm there was significant deterioration in breathing. The patient was admitted to the 
Intensive  Care  Unit  to  manage  anaphylaxis.  Treatment  was  with  adrenaline  and  steroids  as  per 
protocol. There was 48 hours hospital admission. The drug was withdrawn and the patient recovered. 
In  light  of  the  number  of  cases  of  anaphylaxis/anaphylactic  reactions  reported  to  date  and  the  late-
breaking  case  of  angioedema  described  above,  the  MAH  should  provide  its  analysis  of  the  safety 
database to review these events.  
The  MAH  has  not  explained  how  the  50  cases  initially  identified  using  the  MedDRA  SMQs  of 
anaphylaxis, angioedema and hypersensitivity were narrowed down to 13 cases and it is unclear why 
the other 37 cases were not considered to represent anaphylaxis, angioedema or hypersensitivity. This 
should  be  clarified  in  the  next  PSUR  and  further  details  provided  of  the  other  37  cases  which  were 
excluded from this review. 
In the review, the MAH describes 14 cases of angioedema (two initially reported as anaphylaxis and 1 
originally reported as SJS), all but one of which were considered serious, 7 of which involved positive

dechallenge and 2 of which involved positive rechallenge. The case of anaphylaxis with fatal outcome 
and  the  case  initially  reported  as  SJS  were  reviewed  by  Dr  Jonathan  Wilkin  and  his  assessment  of 
these cases as being more likely to be angioedema is endorsed. It would appear that none of the 14 
cases reported to date are consistent with symptoms of anaphylactic reaction.  
The  MAH’s  proposal  to  include  ‘angioedema’  in  product  information  as  an  unwanted  ADR  is  therefore 
endorsed.  However,  two  cases  of  positive  rechallenge  (and  no  cases  of  negative  rechallenge)  were 
reported and angioedema is potentially very serious in any patient but could have particularly severe 
consequences  in  patients  with  IPF,  in  whom  the  airway  is  already  compromised.  One  case  initially 
reported  as  anaphylaxis  was  considered  to  have  symptoms  more  consistent  with  angioedema.  This 
patient  died,  seemingly  from  progression  of  IPF,  but  the  MAH  acknowledges  that  the  role  of 
angioedema  in  this  case  also  needs  to  be  considered.  In  light  of  this,  it  is  therefore  not  considered 
appropriate  that  patients  who  have  previously  experienced  angioedema  should  be  treated  with 
pirfenidone  given  the  already  higher  risk  of  respiratory  complications  in  these  patents.  It  would 
therefore  be  appropriate  to  contraindicate  use  of  pirfenidone  in  patients  who  have  previously 
experienced angioedema with pirfenidone treatment. The proposed warning of ‘should not be used’ in 
section 4.4 be therefore be upgraded to a contraindication in section 4.3. 
It is agreed that angioedema should be considered an important identified risk and the RMP updated as 
such;  the  questionnaire  provided  with the  MAH’s  response  is  acceptable  and  should  be  captured  as  a 
routine Pharmacovigilance measure for the identified risk of angioedema.  
2.2.3.  Discussion 
The  MAH’s  proposal  to  include  ‘agranulocytosis’  in  section  4.8  of  the  SmPC  following  a  spontaneous 
case report received in June 2013  is endorsed by the CHMP with a frequency category of ‘rare’. The 
MAH  also  proposed  to  update  the  Patient  Leaflet  section  4  in  line  with  how  warnings  on  the  risk  of 
agranulocytosis are usually expressed in the Patient Leaflet.  
In  both  cases  of  agranulocytosis,  the  time  to  onset  was  approximately  2  months  (with  a  third  case 
initially  reported  as  ‘agranulocytosis’  but  actually  reporting  a  less  severe  instance  of  decreased 
neutrophil  count  having  a  time  to  onset  of  approximately  4  weeks).  In  all  cases,  patients  were 
symptomatic,  reporting  symptoms  of  fever  or  pyrexia.  This  highlights  the  importance  of  describing 
the  symptoms of  infection  in  the  Patient  Leaflet.  At present,  therefore, there does  not  appear  to  be 
justification  for  inclusion  of  any  warning  or  precaution  for  use  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  to  advise 
prescribers that blood tests should be performed before and during treatment to monitor the risk of 
haemopoietic  reactions.  However,  it  was  considered  to  add  in  section  4  of  the  PL  information  to 
perform a blood test if a patient get signs of an infection such as a sore throat, fever, mouth ulcers or 
flu-like symptoms to check if patients symptoms are related to patient’s medicine. 
The MAH has provided after request for supplementary information more substantial and satisfactory 
discussion  of  the  cases  of  neutropenia  reported  to  date  in  association  with  use  of  pirfenidone.  In 
particularly, the MAH has clarified that figures 1 and 2 may include the same patient include multiple 
times, and therefore the frequency of neutropenia is lower than may appear from these figures. The 
MAH has additionally clarified that the reporting pattern on neutropenia is not consistent with that of 
other  cytotoxic  drugs,  where  an  increased  frequency  and  severity  could  be  expected  with  extended 
use at higher doses. 
The MAH  has provided a discussion of cases reported in CAPACITY and PIPF-012 and it is clear that 
confounding factors which could have accounted for the course of events are present in virtually all of 
these cases. The cases reported spontaneously are also largely confounded and it is therefore agreed 
in  light  of  the  additional  information  now  provided  that  ‘neutropenia’  need  not  be  included  in  the 
Assessment report

SmPC as an ADR at this time. 
In its response on the proposals for product labelling that MAH stated that respiratory infection occurs 
more  frequently  in  idiopathic  pulmonary  fibrosis  and  in  elderly  patients  which  make  up  a  great 
majority  of  the  patients  treated  with  Esbriet.  It  is  agreed  that  it  may  be  difficult  to  distinguish 
between the symptoms suggestive of agranulocytosis (fever, sore throat, mouth ulcers) and those of 
respiratory  infections.  Therefore,  mandating  blood  tests  when  such  symptoms  are  reported  could 
impose  an  unnecessary  burden  on  healthcare  professionals  and  patients  given  that  events  of 
agranulocytosis  are  rare.  Nevertheless,  this  is  an  area  which  the  MAH  should  keep  under  careful 
review.  If  further  blood  dyscrasias  become  listed  side-effects  for  pirfenidone,  the  need  to  include  a 
precaution  for  use  to  perform  a  full  blood  count  in  cases  of  unexplained  infection  that  are  clearly 
different to IPF-related respiratory infections should be considered. 
The  MAH  agreed  to  update  the  Esbriet  SmPC  Section  4.4  to  add  a  reference  to  a  small  number  of 
patients experiencing angioedema. Additionally, the MAH updated Section 4.8 to add language stating 
that angioedema have been observed in post-marketing safety surveillance. . Corresponding sections 
of  the  Patient  Leaflet  was  revised.  The  frequency  of  this  event  is  approximately  12  out  of  12,000 
exposed  patients  (1/1000)  qualifying  this  event  as  uncommon  and  endorsed  by  the  PRAC.  This 
includes  a  contraindication  in  patients  who  have  previously  experienced  angioedema  related  to 
pirfenidone. The MAH’s selection of frequency is appropriate given that no cases of angioedema were 
reported in the clinical development programme in which 1175 patients were exposed to pirfenidone. 
The upper limit of the 95% confidence interval is therefore 1/392 or less and the frequency category 
should be "uncommon", based on worst value of the point estimate.

Angioedema 
Reports of angioedema (some serious) such as swelling of the face, lips and/or tongue which may be 
associated with difficulty breathing or wheezing have been received in association with use of Esbriet 
in  the  post-marketing  setting.  Therefore,  patients  who  develop  signs  or  symptoms  of  angioedema 
following  administration  of  Esbriet  should  immediately  discontinue  treatment.  Patients  with 
angioedema should be managed according to standard of care. Esbriet should not be used in patients

Undesirable effects 
The  safety  of  Esbriet  has  been  evaluated  in  clinical  studies  including  1345  healthy  volunteers  and 
patients.  
The  most  commonly  reported  (≥10%)  adverse  reactions  during  clinical  study experience  with  Esbriet 
at  a  dose  of  2403 mg/day  compared  to  placebo,  respectively,  were  nausea  (32.8%  versus  13.3%), 
rash  (28.7%  versus  8.6%),  fatigue  (22.3%  versus  13.3%),  diarrhoea  (21.7%  versus  13.5%), 
dyspepsia (16.8% versus 5.5%), and photosensitivity reaction (12.2% versus 1.7%).  
Serious  adverse  reactions  were  recorded  at  similar  frequencies  among  patients  treated  with 
2403 mg/day of Esbriet and placebo in clinical studies.  
Table 3 shows the adverse reactions reported at a frequency of ≥2% in 345 patients receiving Esbriet 
at  the  recommended  dose  of  2403 mg/day  in  two  pivotal  Phase  3  studies.  Adverse  reactions  from 
post-marketing  experience  are  also  listed  in  Table  3.  Adverse  reactions  are  listed  by  System  Organ 
Class (SOC) and within each frequency grouping [Very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), 
uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000)] the adverse reactions are presented 
in order of decreasing seriousness.

3.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
The  safety  concerns  remain  in  accordance  with  the  known  safety  profile  of  pirfenidone  although  a 
further  case  of  agranulocytosis  reported  in  a  patient  in  Canada  has  led  the  MAH  to  update  product 
information; blood dyscrasias are already included in the RMP as an important potential risk.  
The MAH provided a review of angioedema/anaphylaxis which described 14 cases of angioedema (two 
initially  reported  as  anaphylaxis  and  1  initially  reported  as  Stevens-Johnson  Syndrome,  with  all  3 
considered  more  likely  to  be  cases  of  angioedema).  All  but  one  of  these  14  cases  was  considered 
serious, 7 cases involved positive dechallenge and 2 cases involved positive rechallenge. On the basis 
of  this  review  the  MAH  proposes  to  update  product  information  to  include  ‘angioedema’  as  an 
uncommonly  reported  ADR  (with  consequential  changes  to  the  Patient  Leaflet).  In  view  of  the 
potentially  life-threatening  nature  of  these  events  and  the  available  data  regarding  reports  of 
angioedema  associated  with  use  of  pirfenidone,  the  PRAC  agreed  that  changes  to  the  product 
information  were  warranted.  Update  following  parallel  PRAC  outcome  PSUR  5  assessment  of  SmPC 
section  4.3  of  the  SmPC  to  include  a  contraindication  in  patients  who  have  previously  experienced 
angioedema  with  pirfenidone,  update  of  section  4.4  to  add  a  warning  on  the  risk  of  angioedema  and 
the  need  for  patients  who  develop  signs  or  symptoms  of  angioedema  following  administration  of 
pirfenidone to discontinue treatment and update of section 4.8 of the SmPC to add ‘angioedema’ with a 
frequency ‘uncommon’. 
The  MAH  has  submitted  an  update  of  the  RMP  on  the  7th  May  2014  to  include  ‘angioedema’  as  an 
important  identified  risk  and  the  proposed  follow-up  questionnaires  should  be  captured  as  a  routine 
Pharmacovigilance  measure  to  address  this  risk.  The  updates  to  product  information  on  the  risk  of 
angioedema  will  also  need  to  be  reflected  in  the  section  on  risk  minimisation  and  the  RMP  summary 
should be updated accordingly. The MAH will continue to monitor all blood dyscrasias in the RMP. 
The benefit risk balance of Esbriet in the approved indications remains positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable 
and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following changes:

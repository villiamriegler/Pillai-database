2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• Study IgPro10_3004, A Phase 3 prospective open-label single-arm study of pharmacokinetics and 
safety of intravenous (IV) IgPro10 in Japanese subjects with primary immunodeficiency (PID)  
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Prospective open-label single-arm study of pharmacokinetics and safety of intravenous (IV) IgPro10 in 
Japanese subjects with primary immunodeficiency (PID) (IgPro10_3004) 
Description 
This was a prospective phase 3, open-label, single-arm study designed to assess the PK and safety of 
IgPro10 in Japanese subjects with PID. Approximately 10 male or female subjects with a diagnosis of 
PID (eg, Congenital agammaglobulinemia [X-linked agammaglobulinemia {XLA}] or Common variable 
immunodeficiency [CVID]) and aged ≥ 6 years were planned to be enrolled into the study (to obtain at 
least 8 evaluable subjects). This study characterized the PK of IgG following intravenous IgPro10 
dosing after a standard wash-in/wash-out period of 12 weeks. Subjects used a 3- or 4-weekly dosing 
regimen; assignment to the dosage regimen was based on each subject’s pre-study schedule as 
prescribed by the treating physician.

Methods 
Objective(s) 
Primary Objective: The primary objective of this study was to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) 
of IgG following intravenous IgPro10 dosing in Japanese primary immunodeficiency (PID) subjects 
after a standard wash-in/wash-out period of 12 weeks. 
Secondary Objective: The secondary objective of the study was to collect safety information about the 
use of IgPro10 in Japanese PID subjects. 
Exploratory Objective: The exploratory objectives of this study were as follows: 
1. To compare the PK of IgG following administration of IgPro10 in Japanese PID subjects to non-
Japanese PID subjects using a pharmacometric modelling approach. 
2. To collect surrogate efficacy data (IgG trough levels) of IgPro10 in Japanese PID subjects. 
Study design 
This was a prospective phase 3, open-label, single-arm study designed to assess the PK and safety of 
IgPro10 in Japanese subjects with PID. This study characterized the PK of IgG following intravenous 
IgPro10 dosing after a standard wash-in/wash-out period of 12 weeks. Subjects used a 3- or 4-weekly 
dosing regimen; assignment to the dosage regimen was based on each subject’s pre-study schedule as 
prescribed by the treating physician. The IgPro10 dose was the same as the pre-study dose on the 
previous intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) product. No comparator product was used in the study.  
The study included a PK sampling period: 
PK sampling period 
The PK sampling period took place during the last IgPro10 dosing cycle starting at Week 13. A 12-week 
wash-in/wash-out period was considered sufficient (approximately 3-fold of half-lives reported in the 
pivotal [ZLB03_002CR: 36.6 days] and extension [ZLB05_006CR: 31.1 days] IgPro10 studies). 
• For 3-weekly dosage regimen, samples were obtained 60 min to 1 min prior to the infusion, 3 min to 
20 min after the infusion, 24 ± 2 h, 3 ± 1 days, 7 ± 1 days, 10 ± 1 days, 14 ± 1 days and 21 ± 1 
days post-infusion / 60 min to 1 min prior to the next infusion. 
• For 4-weekly dosage regimen, the same sample schedule was applied, except for an additional 
sample collection on 28 ± 2 days post-infusion / 60 min to 1 min prior to the next infusion. 
Discussion of Study Design Including Choice of Control Groups 
The current study design accounted for all of the aforementioned recommendations from the 
Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, with the PK of IgPro10 as the primary endpoint, a wash-
in/wash-out period based on the comparison of PK data from the overseas IgPro10 studies, and safety 
evaluated through standard collection of AEs. 
The primary objective of this study was to characterize the PK of IgG following intravenous IgPro10 
dosing in Japanese PID subjects after a standard wash-in/wash-out period of 12 weeks. The wash-
in/wash-out period and exact same timepoints for sample PK collection as  those in the overseas 
IgPro10 studies enable comparison of the PK profile of IgPro10 in Japanese and non-Japanese patients 
with PID. In addition, the safety profile of IgPro10 in Japanese patients could be established based on 
data from this study and overseas clinical studies as well as data from the overseas post-marketing 
experience.

Number of Subjects: 
Planned: 10 
Treatments 
The investigator (or delegate) was to administer or dispense IgPro10 only to subjects included in this 
study following the procedures set out in the study protocol (Appendix 16.1.1). 
The study drug was administered intravenously. Before infusion of IgPro10, the investigator or 
delegate was to ensure the subject was adequately hydrated. 
Identity of Investigational Product(s) 
The following study product was used: 
Page 8/22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Study Product 
The study product, IgPro10, was manufactured by CSL in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice 
guidelines and local regulatory requirements. According to Certificate of Analysis from 16 September 
2016, the actual IgG concentration based on total protein measurement in the filling lot 2129700003 
was 98.6 g/L, or 9.86%. The difference from nominal concentration of 10% IgG constituted 0.14%. It 
was fully within product specification and did not require dose adjustment. 
Selection of Doses in the Study 
The IgPro10 dose used in the study was the same as the subject’s last steady-state pre-study dose on 
the previous IVIG product and was expected to be within 200 to 600 mg/kg per dosing cycle. 
Selection of Timing of Dose for Each Subject 
Enrolled subjects received 3- or 4-weekly infusions of IgPro10 based on their pre-study treatment 
schedule as prescribed by the treating physician. The treatment schedule (3-weekly vs 4-weekly 
infusions) could not be modified during the duration of the study. If the bodyweight changed by more 
than 10%, the IgPro10 dose in mL needed to be adjusted to keep stable dosing in mg/kg. The study 
site calculated the infusion rate based on the subject’s weight (measured to one decimal point) before 
the infusion (see Table 9-3 on Schedule of Assessments). 
All infusions during the study were to start at a low rate of 1.0 mg/kg/min (0.01 mL/kg/min). If well-
tolerated (eg, within 30 min), the infusion rate was cautiously increased at the discretion of the 
investigator as tolerated by the individual subject. The initial infusion rate and all adjustments to the 
infusion rate were recorded. The recommended maximal infusion rate was as summarized in Table 9-2.

Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoints were the point estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the following 
dose- and weight-adjusted PK parameters for IgPro10 determined from PK samples: 
• Cmin of IgG following intravenous IgPro10 dosing 
• Cmax of IgG following intravenous IgPro10 dosing 
• tmax of IgG following intravenous IgPro10 dosing 
• AUC0-last following intravenous IgPro10 dosing 
• CL of IgG following intravenous IgPro10 dosing 
• t1/2 of IgG following intravenous IgPro10 dosing 
The secondary endpoints were the percentage of subjects with: 
• any AE 
• mild AEs 
• moderate AEs 
• severe AEs 
• serious AEs 
• causally-related AEs 
• not causally-related AEs 
that occurred from the time point of start of first IgPro10 infusion up to the End of Study Visit. 
Exploratory endpoints (presented in a separate report) included: 
• Exploratory PK endpoints: AUC0-last, Cmin, Cmax in Japanese PID subjects compared to those from 
non-Japanese subjects. 
• Exploratory Surrogate Efficacy endpoint: Ctrough prior to initial and last IgPro10 study infusion 
Statistical Methods 
There were no formal primary study hypotheses to be tested. Point estimates and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) were calculated for PK parameters as primary endpoints.  
Efficacy: Tables were based on the safety analysis set (SAF) and per-protocol pharmacokinetic analysis 
set. Listings were produced for the SAF.  
Exploratory efficacy analysis: Due to limited study duration, clinical efficacy variables such as the 
annualized rate of infections were not collected. A surrogate efficacy variable of serum IgG 
concentrations was used instead. Ctrough prior to the initial and the last IgPro10 infusion as well as 
the change between the two measurements (Ctrough prior to last IgPro10 infusion minus Ctrough prior 
to initial IgPro10 infusion) were summarized descriptively. 
Safety: AEs starting on or after the date (and time if available) of the first administration of study 
treatment were considered treatment-emergent AEs and were coded using MedDRA dictionary version 
21.0. Extent of exposure, laboratory parameters, infusion data, vital signs, physical examination, and 
viral safety were summarized.  
Pharmacokinetics: The merge of PK concentration data and electronic case report form data to 
generate a dataset with actual blood sampling times, nominal sampling times, actual time relative to 
dosing, and PK concentrations was performed after data base lock. The PK parameters (AUC0-last, 
average dose-adjusted AUC0-last (dAUC), Ctrough, Cmin, Cmax, tmax, t1/2, and CL) were derived 
using standard non-compartmental analysis. Changes in Planned Analyses: Terminal half life was 
added to the PK parameters as part of the PK analysis compared to the most recent version of the 
protocol. Post hoc analyses were performed to provide additional information to describe the extent 
of exposure. Exposure duration (weeks), calculated as (date of last study visit – date of first infusion 
+1)/7, was calculated and summarized. 
Sample size estimation for this study was based on pharmacometric analysis of data from 2 previous 
IgPro10 studies; the largest improvement in precision of PK parameters and inter-subject variability of 
clearance and volume of distribution was achieved with at least 8 subjects. Further increase in 
Page 10/22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
precision of PK parameter beyond N = 8 was expected to be substantially lower. A total of 10 subjects 
were to be enrolled into the study to account for potential study dropouts.

Changes in Conduct of the Study 
There were 2 substantial amendments to the original study protocol (dated 17 Mar 2016). Removal of 
one PK sampling period was introduced in Protocol Amendment 1, dated 19 August 2016, to facilitate 
enrollment. The original protocol included two identical PK sampling periods, one in the first and one in 
the last dosing cycle of the study. This represented a burden to the subjects due to multiple blood 
draws and site visits, therefore, the first PK sampling period was removed. 
Modifications of the virology assessment to change the tests for HIV and hepatitis-C virus were 
introduced in Protocol Amendment 2, dated 3 July 2017, and were based on the need to ensure 
reliable detection of the presence of viral markers in all potential PID subgroups in the study. 
Minor changes made for clarification (e.g., typographical and formatting corrections) did not affect the 
content or conduct of the study.  
Disposition of Subjects 
A total of 11 subjects were screened and all subjects were eligible and enrolled into Study 
IgPro10_3004. 
A total of 10 subjects (90.9%) completed the study and 1 subject (9.1%) discontinued due to a 
treatment-unrelated AE. Subject disposition is presented in (Figure 10-1).

Baseline data 
Demographics: There were 8 male subjects (72.7%) and 3 female subjects (27.3%) in the safety 
analysis set and all subjects were Japanese (100%). The mean (range) age was 29.5 (9 to 67) years. 
The largest age group represented was 18 to 64 years (8 subjects, 72.7%). The mean (range) baseline 
body weight was 58.18 (27.5 to 78.9) kg and the mean body mass index (range) was 21.79 (16.3 to 
28.3) kg/m2. 
Disease Characteristics at Baseline 
Four subjects (36.4%) had a diagnosis of CVID, 6 subjects (54.5%) had a diagnosis of XLA, and 1 
subject (9.1%) had a diagnosis of other immunodeficiency at baseline. The mean time since first PID 
diagnosis was 18.38 (4.2 to 42.3) years for the SAF. Mean of serum IgG levels at the time of first PID 
diagnosis was 0.93 (0.1 to 3.4) g/L. 
Data Sets Analyzed 
One subject in the 4-weekly dosing group was excluded from PKAS and PPKAS due to unavailable PK 
data -this subject left the study before collection of PK samples.

Efficacy results 
Subject Disposition: A total of 11 subjects were screened and all subjects were eligible and enrolled 
into Study IgPro10_3004. A total of 10 subjects (90.9%) completed the study and 1 subject (9.1%) 
discontinued due to an AE, which required the use of prohibited concomitant medication for treatment. 
Efficacy: Serum IgG trough levels were stable during the study. IgG trough levels [mean (SD)] prior to 
last IgPro10 infusion were 10.045 (2.5244) g/L in the 3-weekly (n = 2) and 7.956 (3.7770) g/L in the 
4-weekly groups (n = 8). The change [mean (SD)] in IgG trough levels from baseline to the end of 
study visit was -0.855 (0.5020) g/L in the 3-weekly (n = 2) and - 0.295 (0.4430) g/L in the 4-weekly 
group (n = 8), with mean difference for all study subjects of - 0.407 (0.4862) g/L. This mean 
difference constitutes less than 5% of both the baseline and the final trough levels and is within the 
same-run assay variability. 
Pharmacokinetics: Maximum IgG concentrations were attained at the first sampling time point, right 
after the end of infusion. Average AUC0-last were 5971 and 6591 g*h/L following 3- and 4-weekly 
intravenous (IV) infusions of IgPro10, respectively. Geometric mean (95% CI) AUC0-last was 5891 
g*h/L following 3-weekly IV infusions and 6239 (4713 to 8258) g*h/L following 4-weekly IV infusions 
of IgPro10. Average dose adjusted AUC0-last (dAUC) was 0.409 and 0.455 g*h/L per mg of IgPro10 
administered every 3- or 4-weeks, respectively. Geometric mean (and associated 95% CI) for dAUC 
was 0.424 (0.302 to 0.594) g*h/L following 4-weekly IV infusions of IgPro10 and 0.402 g*h/L 
following 3-weekly IV infusions. Clearance following 3-weekly IV infusions of IgPro10 was comparable 
to CL following 4-weekly IV infusions of IgPro10, as average CL was 2.53 mL/h for both treatment 
schedules. Average minimum observed IgG level (Cmin) were 10.6 and 8.53 g/L, respectively, for the 
3- and 4-weekly IV infusions of IgPro10. 
Efficacy Analysis of IgG Trough Levels 
Table 11-3 presents the IgG trough levels throughout the study. Mean (SD) IgG trough levels prior to 
initial IgPro10 infusion (g/L) were 10.900 (2.0223) in the 3-weekly and 8.629 (4.0177) in the 4-weekly 
groups. The change in IgG trough levels was - 0.855 (0.5020) in the 3-weekly (n = 2) and - 0.295 
(0.4430) in the 4-weekly group (n = 8), with mean difference for all study patients of - 0.407 (0.4862) 
g/L. This mean difference constitutes less than 5% of both the baseline and the final trough levels and 
is within the same-run variability of the IgG assay (Table 11-3). 
Blood samples for baseline serum IgG trough level were taken on schedule, on the last day of their 
individual 3-weekly or 4-weekly dosing cycle, in all but 3 study subjects. The remaining 3 subjects had 
their baseline samples collected 1-2 days earlier or seven days earlier, when serum IgG concentrations 
were likely higher than by the end of their respective dosing periods. The impact of this on the mean 
baseline trough value for all study patients is impossible to quantify, but it is expected to be negligible.

While the mean Cmax appears slightly higher for the 3-weekly infusion regimen, subject numbers were 
small (n = 2), and the individual values spanned similar ranges. The mean Cmax was 16.6 and 14.2 
g/L following 3-weekly and 4-weekly IV infusions of IgPro10, respectively, occurring approximately 1 h 
post-start of infusion for both treatment schedules. The geometric mean (and associated 95% CI) 
Cmax was 13.4 (9.98 to 18.0) g/L following 4-weekly IV infusions of IgPro10 and 16.4 g/L following 3-
weekly IV infusions. Average AUC0-last were 5971 and 6591 g*h/L following 3- and 4-weekly IV 
infusions of IgPro10, respectively. Geometric mean (95% CI) AUC0-last was 5891 g*h/L following 3- 
weekly IV infusions and 6239 (4713 to 8258) g*h/L following 4-weekly IV infusions of IgPro10. 
Average dose-adjusted AUC0-last (dAUC) was 0.409 and 0.455 g*h/L per mg of IgPro10 administered 
3- or 4-weekly, respectively. Geometric mean (and associated 95% CI) for dAUC was 0.424 (0.302 to 
0.594) g*h/L following 4-weekly IV infusions of IgPro10 and 0.402 g*h/L following 3-weekly IV 
infusions. Clearance following 3-weekly IV infusions of IgPro10 mirrored CL following 4-weekly IV 
Page 15/22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
infusions of IgPro10, as the average CL was 2.53 mL/h for both treatment schedules. Average Cmin 
were 10.6 and 8.53 g/L, respectively, for the 3- and 4-weekly IV infusions of IgPro10. 
Safety results 
Safety and Tolerability: The total mean (range) duration of exposure was 14.86 (4.1 to 16.3) weeks. 
Eight subjects (72.7%) experienced at least 1 AE during the entire study. One subject discontinued the 
IgPro10 treatment. The subject was withdrawn from the study to receive prohibited 
immunosuppressive concomitant medication as a treatment for the unrelated AE of worsening of 
psoriasis vulgaris. 
There were no serious adverse events (SAEs) or deaths reported during the study. One subject (9.1%) 
experienced an AE related to IgPro10 treatment and 3 subjects (27.3%) experienced temporally 
associated AEs. Majority of the AEs were reported as mild in intensity. No severe AEs were reported at 
any time during the study. There were no causally-related AEs except for an AE of infusion site 
discomfort.  
Out of 10 subjects who completed the full study course and therefore had a theoretical 
possibility of reaching a high flow rate, 9 subjects tolerated the flow rate of 8 mg/kg/min or higher, 
and 5 subjects (50% of study population) safely tolerated IgPro10 infusions at 12 mg/kg/min, or 7.2 
mL/kg/h. 
Analysis of Adverse Events 
Page 16/22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 12-3 displays AEs by SOC and PT. The most common AE reported was nasopharyngitis (3 
subjects, 27.3%), all of which were unrelated to IgPro10. No other AEs were reported in more than 1 
subject. 
A total of 19 TEAEs were reported in 8 subjects (Table 14.3.1.1). However, majority of the AEs were 
reported as mild in (highest) intensity (Table 14.3.1.3). One AE of psoriasis led to discontinuation of 
IgPro10 (to receive prohibited immunosuppressive concomitant medication; also see Section 14.3.3). 
Other moderate events were reported as resolved and no action was taken with the study drug due to 
these events.  
Majority of the AEs were reported as not causally related to IgPro10. Only one AE of mild infusion site 
discomfort was reported as causally related to IgPro10 treatment (Table 14.3.1.4). The AE was 
reported as resolved and no action was taken with the study drug in terms of both the dose and the 
flow rate due to this event.

Conclusions: 
Serum IgG trough values were stable during the study. Mean trough levels conducted by CSL Behring 
(within 8 to 10 g/L) in this study were comparable to those observed in the Studies ZLB03_002 (within 
8 to 10 g/L) and ZLB05_006 (~11 g/L). 
Mean absolute values of Cmax in this study, in the range of 14 to 16 g/L, were lower than respective 
Cmax in the studies of IgPro10 in non-Japanese in the range of 25 to 28 g/L, but the mean doses of

IgPro10 in this study were also significantly lower, at ~280 mg/kg vs. ~620 mg/kg per dosing cycle in 
the studies conducted outside Japan. While there are slight differences in the mean PK values, this is 
based on low subject numbers and there are no noticeable differences in the range of the individual 
values between the two dosing regimens. 
There were no severe AEs or SAEs or deaths reported in the study. No new safety findings were 
identified. 
In summary, intravenous infusions of IgPro10 as immunoglobulin replacement therapy in Japanese 
subjects with primary immunodeficiency at the median dose of ~280 mg/kg per dosing cycle were safe 
and well tolerated at the flow rate of up to 12 mg/kg/min (7.2 mL/kg/h). The key IgPro10 PK 
parameters in Japanese subjects were comparable to those observed in other IgPro10 studies 
conducted outside Japan. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
This MAH submitted the results of a prospective phase 3, open-label, single-arm study designed to 
assess the PK and safety of IgPro10 in Japanese subjects with PID. The majority of the enrolled and 
treated patients were adults (9), moreover 1 child (9 years) and 1 adolescent (13 years) were treated.  
Four subjects (36.4%) had a diagnosis of CVID, 6 subjects (54.5%) had a diagnosis of XLA, and 1 
subject (9.1%) had a diagnosis of other immunodeficiency at baseline. The study characterized the PK 
of IgG following intravenous IgPro10 dosing after a standard wash-in/wash-out period of 12 weeks. 
Subjects used a 3- or 4-weekly dosing regimen and continued their preexisting dosing schedule of their 
individual IVIG. No comparator was used. 
The primary objective was to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of IgG following intravenous 
IgPro10 dosing in Japanese primary immunodeficiency (PID) subjects after a standard wash-in/wash-
out period of 12 weeks; this PK profile was compared with that of overseas IgPro10 studies which had 
enrolled non-Japanese PID subjects. Besides, safety information was collected. 
The study design and PK sampling period as well as the eligibility criteria are considered suitable. 
90.9% (10/11) completed the study; one case of study drug discontinuation was causally not related 
to IgPro10 use. The efficacy results show consistent IgG trough levels in all patients independent of the 
dose regimen compared to those of predecessor studies ZLB03_002 (within 8 to 10 g/L) and 
ZLB05_006 (~11 g/L). However, the total sample sizes were very small and unequally distributed 
between the both dose regimen. Moreover, not all PK parameters seem to be comparable since 
different dosing regimen were applied in the overseas IgPro10 studies. The data were not specifically 
evaluated according to age groups but the IgG concentrations were within the normal ranges for the 
age groups (normal IgG ranges in g/l are between 6.00-13.00 for 6-9 year-old children, 7.00-14.00 for 
10-13 year-olds and 7.00-16.00 for adults, demonstrating a large overlap in normal values for children 
and adults).  
The overall safety profile in the study was consistent with previous studies with no new safety signals 
observed. The frequency of AEs, including infections and other events of interest, reported during the 
course of the study was consistent with the known safety profile of IgPro10 reported in previous 
studies and reflected in the SmPC. However, considering the sample size with merely 2 paediatric 
patients the informative value is very limited. According to the current IVIG Guideline on the clinical 
investigation of human normal immunoglobulin for intravenous administration (IVIg) 
(EMA/CHMP/BPWP/94033/2007 rev. 3) a minimum of 20 paediatric and 20 adult patients are 
requested to demonstrate robust PK, efficacy and safety data. On the basis of the provided data it is 
acknowledged that the different study results are consistent so far. However, this is the only definite 
statement that can be made. 
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
The results of the finalized study IgPro10_3004 showed a consistent PK, efficacy and safety profile of 
IgPro10 in the evaluated Japanese patients with PID.

Infections were the most frequently reported events during the study but they were mild in intensity 
and manageable. Infections and infestations are already described in the SmPC of IgPro10. No SAEs 
occurred. The safety data from the final analysis showed no new safety findings compared to the 
known safety profile of IgPro10. It is, however, noted that the relevance of these study results is very 
limited due to the little sample size comprising only 2 paediatric patients. 
No changes to the SmPC were proposed. This is acceptable. 
As the efficacy and safety data were consistent with those of prior clinical studies, the favourable 
benefit-risk profile of Privigen remains unchanged.

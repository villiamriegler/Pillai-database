2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Drug-resistance to currently available anti-CMV agents such as ganciclovir, foscarnet and cidofovir is 
an emerging problem which may lead to graft loss and even be fatal for some transplant patients due 
to limited treatment options. Moreover, there are severe treatment-limiting toxicities with existing 
agents. Thus, there is an unmet medical need for CMV therapies with substantial benefit (e.g. in regard 
to efficacy, including lack of relevant cross-resistance and/or safety profile) over current therapeutic 
options in transplant patients. 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Human Cytomegalovirus (CMV), also known as human herpes virus 5, is a double-stranded DNA virus 
in the herpesvirus family. Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is common, with serologic evidence 
of prior infection in 40% to 100% of various adult populations, and mostly acquired early in life. 
Primary CMV infection may be asymptomatic or manifest as self-limited febrile illness in 
immunocompetent individuals. However, serious HCMV disease occurs almost exclusively in individuals 
with compromised or immature immune systems, including transplant recipients, patients with 
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), immunosuppressed cancer patients, and neonates. 
Disease manifestations include retinitis, colitis, esophagitis, pneumonia, hepatitis, and 
meningoencephalitis. 
As with other herpesviruses, CMV can persist as a latent virus after primary infection. Among 
individuals with intact immune system, reactivation of CMV infection is uncommon and generally 
asymptomatic. However, CMV reactivation in immunocompromised patients including solid organ 
Assessment report  
EMA/792160/2022 
Page 11/12 
 
 
 
 
transplant (SOT) recipients and haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients is associated 
with serious disease and increased mortality risk. 
Uncontrolled CMV replication leads to dissemination to multiple organs and end-organ diseases such as 
pneumonitis, retinitis or hepatitis. Moreover, CMV infection is associated with indirect effects including 
increased risk of secondary bacterial or fungal infections or graft-versus-host disease in HSCT 
recipients or allograft loss in SOT recipients. 
Development of antiviral resistance to currently available anti-CMV agents is a clinical challenge in SOT 
and HSCT recipients, leading to graft loss, and even death in some patients. 
The initially proposed indication was as follows: 
“Treatment of adults with post-transplant cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and/or disease who are 
resistant and/or refractory to one or more prior therapy, including ganciclovir, valganciclovir, cidofovir 
or foscarnet.” 
Thus, the indication pertains to SOT and HSCT recipients who have a detectable CMV viral load (CMV 
viraemia) with (CMV syndrome or CMV end-organ disease) or without (CMV infection) accompanied 
symptoms and who are genotypically resistant to available anti-CMV drugs. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
CMV is globally disseminated. Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is common, with serologic 
evidence of prior infection in 40% to 100% of various adult populations. For the general population a 
global CMV seroprevalence of 83% and for Europe a CMV seroprevalence of 66% were recently 
estimated (Zuhair et al., 2019).  
CMV infection in transplant recipients can result either from the transmission of CMV from donor tissue 
or from reactivation of a latent CMV infection in the transplant recipient. The risk of CMV infection is 
influenced by a number of factors, such as the CMV serostatus of the donor and recipient, the 
transplant types (SOT or HCST), the type of SOT organ transplanted, the net state of the host 
immunosuppression, and viral factors. Despite CMV prevention strategies (prophylaxis or preemptive 
therapy) in high-risk transplant populations, clinically significant CMV infection occurs in up to 35% of 
transplant patients (Boeckh et al., 2003; Legendre and Pascual, 2008). In the absence of prophylaxis 
or pre-emptive therapy the rate of CMV infection occurs in up to 40-80% (Ljungmann et al., 2011; 
Takenaka et al, 2015). 
Post-transplant CMV infection is associated with substantial morbidity, a higher mortality risk, and 
increased cost of care compared to transplant recipients who do not develop post-transplant CMV 
infection (Biron, 2006; Falagas et al., 1998; San Juan et al., 2008; Yoo et al., 2011). Both directly and 
indirectly, CMV infection is the leading viral cause of morbidity and mortality among solid organ 
transplant (SOT) recipients (Biron, 2006). Untreated CMV pneumonia, for example, has a mortality 
rate of >50% among haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients (Boeckh et al., 1996; 
Konoplev et al., 2001). 
Development of antiviral resistance to currently available anti-CMV agents is a clinical challenge in SOT 
and HSCT recipients, leading to graft loss, and even death in some patients. Ganciclovir resistance 
developed in 7% donor-positive/recipient-negative kidney, liver, and pancreas recipients who were 
prophylaxed with approximately 3 months of oral GCV (Limaye et al., 2000). GCV-resistant disease 
accounted for 20% of CMV disease, occurred late (a median of 10 months after transplantation), was 
associated with higher intensity of immunosuppression, and was considered a clinically serious concern 
Assessment report  
EMA/792160/2022 
Page 12/13 
 
 
 
(Avery, 2007). Ganciclovir resistant CMV infections were shown to be associated with a longer 
hospitalisation, serious toxicities from other treatments and increased mortality (Limaye et al., 2002) 
Furthermore, refractory CMV infection, defined as detection of CMV for 2 or more weeks despite anti-
CMV treatment, developed in 50% of HSCT recipients receiving standard anti-CMV therapy. Refractory 
CMV infection occurring within the first 100 days after HSCT was associated with increased risk of CMV 
organ disease and treatment-related mortality (Liu et al., 2015). 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Antiviral resistance remains an Achilles heel of CMV treatment associated with higher morbidity and 
mortality. All antiviral agents currently used for treatment of CMV infection/disease target the viral 
DNA polymerase. Mechanisms of resistance to current anti-CMV drugs include gene mutations in viral 
genes encoding the UL97 Ser/Thr kinase and UL54 DNA polymerase. The UL97 kinase is involved in 
phosphorylation of various cellular and viral proteins as well as phosphorylation of the nucleoside 
analogue ganciclovir which is required for anti-viral activity. Thus, UL97 mutations impairing this 
phosphorylation (e.g. M460V/I, H520Q, C592G, A594V, L595S and C603W) confer resistance to 
ganciclovir/valganciclovir. Mutations in UL54 can lead to resistance towards all currently available 
drugs. Thus, new drugs with a different mode of action are urgently needed. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis 
CMV infection is defined as virus isolation or detection of viral proteins or nucleic acid in any body fluid 
or tissue specimen regardless of symptomatology whereas CMV disease is accompanied by clinical 
signs or symptoms. The clinical manifestations range from viraemia to CMV syndrome (fevers, 
malaise) to invasive disease (e.g. pneumonitis, colitis, pneumonitis, retinitis, hepatitis, esophagitis and 
menigoencephalitis). CMV disease typically occurs between Day 30 and Day 100 post-transplant (de la 
Hoz et al., 2002). The indirect effects of CMV comprise opportunistic infections, an association between 
CMV and graft dysfunction and failure, acute rejection and reduced patient survival. 
There are two main methods used to diagnose CMV infection: the pp65 antigenaemia assay and real-
time PCR. The latter can be used for early detection of viral replication. The 1st WHO International 
Standard for Human Cytomegalovirus for Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques (CMV WHO IS; NIBSC) 
can be used to unify the reporting of CMV viral loads. For proven CMV end-organ disease the presence 
of characteristic clinical symptoms and/or signs are required together with documentation of CMV in 
tissue from the relevant organ e.g. by histopathology, virus isolation, rapid culture, 
immunohistochemistry, or DNA hybridisation (Ljungman et al., 2017). 
2.1.5.  Management 
Management of post-transplant CMV infection focuses on preventing disease progression and 
development of complications during the period of immunosuppression by reducing CMV viraemia to 
undetectable levels. The current standard of care involves empiric use of available anti-CMV agents 
such as ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir. However, with the exception of ganciclovir 
(indicated for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) in adults and adolescents ≥ 12 years of age), 
none of these agents is authorised for treatment of CMV disease in transplant patients in the EU. The 
total exposure and duration of use of these agents, relative to the period in which a transplant 
recipient is immunosuppressed and therefore at risk of breakthrough CMV infection/reactivation, could 
be limited in some patients due to their respective toxicities: bone marrow suppression caused by 
ganciclovir/valganciclovir and renal impairment caused by foscarnet or cidofovir (Boeckh et al., 2003; 
Assessment report  
EMA/792160/2022 
Page 13/14 
 
 
 
Ljungman et al., 2001; Reusser et al., 2002; Salzberger et al., 1997). These toxicities are of particular 
concern in transplant patients, in whom the bone marrow has been ablated or significantly suppressed 
(HSCT patients), who continue to receive immunosuppressants to prevent organ rejection (SOT 
patients), who develop graft vs host disease (GVHD) (in HSCT patients), or patients who may require 
the use of other therapies that are potentially toxic to the kidneys or other organs (SOT and HSCT 
patients). The shared mechanism of action (i.e., inhibition of viral DNA polymerase activity encoded by 
gene locus UL54) among these agents also makes them susceptible to the development of cross-
resistance (Avery, 2007; Limaye et al., 2000). The development of resistance to existing anti-CMV 
agents may be overcome or reduced (by increasing the dose [e.g., val/ganciclovir], decreasing 
immunosuppression, combining, or switching among the available antiviral drugs), and toxicity may be 
ameliorated (by administering growth factors to combat haematotoxicity or lowering the dose to 
minimise renal toxicity), some patients exhaust treatment options and ultimately lose their graft or die 
as a result of CMV infection or disease (Zafrani L. et al., 2009; Razonable, 2010). In addition, the 
trade-off of immunosuppression reduction as a therapeutic strategy for CMV infection in the setting of 
toxicity or the lack of efficacy of current anti-CMV agents, is the risk of organ rejection with fatal 
consequences for the patient. 
2.2.  About the product 
The current application concerns an antiviral film-coated tablet for oral administration of maribavir, an 
inhibitor of the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) protein kinase UL97. 
Maribavir is a benzimidazole riboside that inhibits HCMV replication. Maribavir antiviral activity is 
mediated by competitive inhibition of the HCMV protein kinase UL97 at the adenosine triphosphate 
(ATP) binding site, abolishing phosphotransferase, thereby interfering with viral DNA replication, 
encapsidation, and nuclear egress. 
The following indication and posology are proposed (D0): 
“Treatment of adults with post-transplant cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and/or disease who are 
resistant and/or refractory to one or more prior therapy, including ganciclovir, valganciclovir, cidofovir 
or foscarnet.” 
The recommended dose of maribavir is 400 mg (two 200mg tablets) with or without food twice daily 
resulting in a daily dose of 800mg. 
2.3.  Type of application and aspects on development 
The CHMP did not agree to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
not considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on the strength of evidence that 
was presented which was not considered strong enough to support an accelerated assessment 
procedure. While it was considered that maribavir may turn out as a therapeutic advantage compared 
to available treatments, with improvements in both efficacy and safety, the claimed effects were not 
duly substantiated, i.e. it remained unclear, if maribavir resistant strains remain sensitive to other 
antivirals. The presented studies supporting the Applicant´s claims on efficacy and safety carried 
apparent methodological limitations, which cannot be overcome by the observed therapeutic effects. 
The clinical development plan did not follow the CHMP advice concerning the statistical analysis of the 
primary efficacy endpoint and suffer from additional severe limitations due to the open-label study 
design of the single pivotal trial. Of the two supportive phase 2 studies brought forward by the 
Applicant, one lacks a control arm and the other does not cover the target population. The 
sustainability of viral clearance beyond week 8 remained unclear. Further, important data on 
Assessment report  
EMA/792160/2022 
Page 14/15 
 
 
 
recurrence of CMV infection, all-cause mortality and development of resistance that could contribute to 
the strength of evidence were not provided. The commercial tablet formulation used in the pivotal 
clinical study is not identical to the formulation used in phase 2. These limitations were considered to 
potentially severely impact the study results. Hence, CHMP concluded that based on the currently 
available strength of evidence, an accelerated assessment of the medicinal product was not warranted.  
2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets containing 200 mg of maribavir as an active 
substance.  
Other ingredients are:  
Tablet core: microcrystalline cellulose (E460(i)), sodium starch glycolate, magnesium stearate (E470b) 
Film-coat: poly(vinyl alcohol) (E1203), macrogol (polyethylene glycol) (E1521), titanium dioxide 
(E171), talc (E553b), brilliant blue FCF aluminium lake (E133). 
The product is available in high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with child-resistant closure as 
described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.4.2.  Active Substance 
2.4.2.1.  General information 
The chemical name of maribavir is 5,6-Dichloro-2-(isopropylamino)-1-β-L-ribofuranosyl-1H-
benzimidazole, corresponding to the molecular formula C15H19Cl2N3O4. It has a molecular mass of 
376.24 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
The chemical structure of maribavir was elucidated by a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance 
spectroscopy (1H NMR, 13C NMR), mass spectrometry (MS), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy 
(FT-IR), UV-VIS spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and single crystal X-ray crystallography. The solid 
state properties of the active substance were measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), 
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and dynamic vapour sorption 
(DVS). 
Maribavir contains four chiral centres within the L-ribofuranosyl ring and shows polymorphism.

2.4.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Maribavir is synthesised in 4 main steps using well defined starting materials with acceptable 
specifications. 
During the procedure, two major objections (MO1 and MO2) were raised in relation to acceptability of 
the starting materials. All the concerns related to the MO1 and MO2 were satisfactorily resolved, the 
applicant has provided sufficiently detailed justification for choice of the starting materials and applied 
adequate and suitable controls to ensure the routine quality. The starting materials are considered 
justified according to ICH Q11 guideline. Nevertheless, the CHMP recommended and the applicant 
agreed (REC 1-4):  
1.  to conduct further experimental investigations for further support of an impurity limit in a 
starting material, and to update a dossier section with method validation of the purity method. 
2.  to include derivatives of impurities in the specification of a starting material as specified 
impurities 
3.  to further evaluate the suitability of the purity method for a starting material related to an 
impurity and derivative 
4.  to re-evaluate the acceptance criterion for single unknown impurities in the specification of an 
intermediate when additional number of batches have been manufactured 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. The characterisation 
of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new 
active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and 
characterised. A major objection (MO 3) was raised during the procedure requesting the applicant to 
provide a discussion on origin, levels, and carry-over of the impurity. The major objection was 
resolved, as the applicant provided additional clarification and justification.  
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the 
clinical development programme. The manufacturing process has undergone several modifications. A 
sufficiently detailed description of the development of the manufacturing process is presented. The 
quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is considered to be 
comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process. 
The manufacturing process has been developed using a combination of conventional univariate studies 
and elements of QbD such as risk assessment, design of experiment (DOE) and one variable at a time 
(OVAT) studies. Based on these studies, proven acceptable ranges (PAR) have been defined for the 
manufacturing process of the active substance. The available development data, the proposed control 
strategy and batch analysis data from commercial scale batches fully support the proposed PARs. 
Critical process parameters (CPP), critical in-process controls, and critical material attributes (CMA) for 
the manufacturing process of the active substance necessary to ensure consistent quality were 
identified based on a quality risk assessment. The related critical quality attributes (CQA) of the active 
substance are listed under the section Specification. Appropriate controls have been established to 
ensure the routine production of the active substance with consistent quality.  
The active substance package complies with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as 
amended. 
Assessment report  
EMA/792160/2022 
Page 16/17 
 
 
 
2.4.2.3.  Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for description, identification, solid form, assay, 
related substances, sulphated ash, residual solvents, water content, particle size and microbial limits 
tests. 
The active substance specifications are based on the active substance CQA, Parameters included in the 
specification cover all the critical aspects for ensuring the quality of the active substance. Impurities 
present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by toxicological 
and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. An assessment of potential genotoxic 
impurities has been performed in conformance with ICH M7.  
PSD data were adequately presented and justified, however the applicant is recommended to finalise 
the PSD testing through the active substance shelf life (REC 5). The analytical methods used have 
been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and 
impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from three production-scale batches manufactured with a synthetic route 
equivalent to the commercial route of synthesis (PPQ batches) were provided. The results are within 
the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. Additionally, representative number of batches 
used in clinical studies and as stability batches were provided as supportive data. 
2.4.2.4.  Stability 
Stability data from three primary production-scale batches of active substance from the proposed 
manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package in a container closure system representative 
of that intended for the market under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months 
under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
Additional supportive stability data were provided. 
All tested parameters were within the specifications, no significant changes were observed for any 
parameter. Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed. The stability results 
indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently stable. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is an immediate release tablet including 200 mg maribavir for oral administration. 
Maribavir 200 mg is a blue, film-coated, oval-shaped, convex tablet that is de-bossed with ‘SHP’ on 
one side and ‘620’ on the other side.  
Pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements. The quality target product 
profile (QTPP) was defined as an immediate release dosage form that meets compendial and other 
relevant quality standards.  
The manufacturing development has been evaluated through the use of criticality analysis to identify 
the CQA and the CPP of the finished product. Material attributes and process parameters were 
reviewed and classified as potentially critical or non-critical based on their potential to impact finished 
product CQA. The formulation development is sufficiently described.  
Assessment report  
EMA/792160/2022 
Page 17/18 
 
 
 
Major objections (MO4 – MO6) were raised regarding the dissolution comparability and batch to batch 
consistency. Based on the additional submitted data and provided justification, the CHMP considered 
that it has been sufficiently proven that the differences in dissolution profiles between the commercial 
and relevant pivotal clinical batches are not clinically relevant. The MOs related to dissolution 
comparability were resolved, the commercial and clinical batches are considered comparable. The 
choice of the dissolution method has been justified.    
The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated. All excipients are well 
known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. For the non-
compendial excipient, an adequate in-house specification is given. The list of excipients is included in 
section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.4.1 of this report. The compatibility of the active 
substance and the excipients was sufficiently investigated. No overages are used in the formulation of 
maribavir 200 mg tablet. 
The primary packaging is high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle with child resistant cap. The 
material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The child resistant closure test results comply 
with 16 CFR 1700.20, which has been shown to be equivalent to ISO 8317:2015 requirements. The 
choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the 
intended use of the product.  
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of following steps: blending, sifting, lubrication, compression and 
coating.  
Process validation data for three consecutive production batches (PPQ batches) manufactured by the 
current manufacturer using the proposed commercial manufacturing process were provided showing 
compliance with in-process controls, proven acceptable ranges and the release specification. The in-
process and batch characterisation data of the three PPQ batches were consistent to each other. It has 
been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of 
intended quality in a reproducible manner and that the in-process controls are adequate for this type 
of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Proven acceptable ranges (PAR) have been defined.  The available development data, the proposed 
control strategy and batch analysis data from commercial scale batches fully support the proposed 
PARs. 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications shown include appropriate tests for this kind of 
dosage form including description, identification, assay, uniformity of dosage units, related substances, 
dissolution and microbiological examination. 
The finished product specifications are in line with ICH Q6A. Limits for impurities are acceptable 
according to ICH Q3B. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. The information on 
the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory.  
Following the first round of assessment, a major objection (MO7) was raised in relation to the potential 
risk of presence of nitrosamines in the finished product. Based on the additional data presented in 
Assessment report  
EMA/792160/2022 
Page 18/19 
 
 
 
response, a MO was successfully resolved. A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of 
nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been performed considering all suspected and actual 
root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on 
the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine 
impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure 
under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal 
products” (EMA/369136/2020).  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three PPQ batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Furthermore, batch analysis data are given for representative number of production scale batches used 
as clinical, primary or stability batches.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
Stability data from three production scale primary batches of finished product stored for up to 24 
months under long term conditions (25ºC / 60% RH) and intermediate conditions (30°C / 75% RH) 
and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines 
were provided. The stability batches were packaged in a configuration that is representative of the 
commercial finished product packaging configuration.  
The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. The stability study results showed no significant 
changes or trending. The storage conditions were endorsed as “Do not store above 30°C.”  
No significant changes were observed after freeze-thaw cycling study and in the in-use study. One 
batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug 
Substances and Products. The finished product is not photosensitive. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 30 months and storage conditions “Do not 
store above 30°C.” as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3 and 6.4) are acceptable. 
2.4.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substance and finished 
product and their manufacturing process. However, no design spaces were claimed for the 
manufacturing process of the active substance, nor for the finished product. 
Assessment report  
EMA/792160/2022

All major objections raised during the evaluation (acceptability of the starting materials, lack of 
discussion on origin, levels, and carry-over of the impurity, dissolution comparability between 
commercial batches and batches used during the clinical development, potential risk of presence of 
nitrosamines) have been resolved by provision of the relevant additional information and data or by 
applying additional control strategy.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no 
impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. These points are put forward and agreed as 
recommendations for future quality development. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.4.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
1.  to conduct further experimental investigations for further support of an impurity limit in a 
starting material, and to update a dossier section with method validation of the purity method. 
2.  to include derivatives of impurities in the specification of a starting material as specified 
impurities 
3.  to further evaluate the suitability of the purity method for a starting material related to an 
impurity and derivative  
4.  to re-evaluate the acceptance criterion for unknown impurities in the specification of an 
intermediate when additional number of batches have been manufactured 
5.  to conduct further particle size testing of the on-going long-term stability study. 
The recommendations concerning the active substance should be fulfilled within the framework of a 
variation procedure since an update of module 3 will be required. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vivo pharmacodynamics effects on HCMV were analysed in different animal models (transplanted 
human tissue or surrogate animal viral strains) in comparison to ganciclovir a two other benzimidazole 
nucleosides. 
Assessment report  
EMA/792160/2022 
Page 20/21 
 
 
 
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Maribavir showed no significant effects in a PharmaScreen profiling panel (PANLABS, Inc.) of in vitro 
and in vivo tests to identify possible off-target activity of maribavir, including its broad pharmacological 
effects on the CNS, CV, and GI systems, as well as on metabolic, inflammation and allergy, 
microbiological activity. However, due to the poor quality of the study report a thorough assessment of 
this report is not possible. The maribavir concentrations (3, 10 and 30 µg/mL) used in in vitro assays 
are approximately 10 to 100 fold higher than the unbound clinically Cmax level of 0.344 µg/mL and the 
majority of the oral doses used in the in vivo studies (except the 300 mg/kg dose in mice) were below, 
in the range of or slightly above the clinical exposure at the Cmax, when deduced from the TK-studies 
of the repeat-dose toxicity studies. Pharmacokinetic data of maribavir after IP administration are not 
available. 
In a further study, effects of maribavir on the autonomic nervous system in vitro were evaluated in 
Dunkin Hartley guinea pig ileum and rabbit aorta. Maribavir does not modify alpha-adrenoreceptor 
activity in rabbit aorta but showed anticholinergic and antihistaminergic activity in vitro at 10 µM (3.76 
µg/mL) in guinea pig ileum. However, antihistaminergic and anti-cholinergic effect by maribavir was 
not pointed out as an adverse issue in the toxicological studies. 
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
A core battery of in vivo and in vitro safety pharmacology studies was performed with maribavir. These 
included studies on effects on central nervous, cardiovascular (in vivo and in vitro) and respiratory 
systems. The in vivo safety pharmacology studies were conducted in 1996 and are therefore of older 
origin. Whereas the in vitro hERG assay was performed under GLP, the in vivo safety pharmacology 
studies have not been performed under GLP. As outlined in the ICH S7A guideline, the safety 
pharmacology core battery should ordinarily be conducted in compliance with GLP. The applicant 
justifies that except for the hERG study, the safety pharmacology studies were conducted prior to the 
introduction of ICH S7A guidance and were therefore not Good Laboratory Practice (GLP-) compliant. 
However, the studies were conducted in reputable laboratories, using suitable group sizes to allow 
adequate statistical analysis of the results.  
Considering that the in vivo safety pharmacology studies have been performed prior to introduction of 
the ICH S7A guideline and in view of the available GLP-compliant single-and repeated dose toxicity 
studies and the clinical studies, the lack of GLP compliance is acceptable. 
CNS effects of maribavir were investigated in a behavioural study in CD-1 male mice at oral single 
doses of 250, 500 and 100 mg/kg. Pronounced effects on the CNS (hypoactivity, hypothermia, 
blepharospasm, tremors, ataxia and variable changes in respiration rate) were seen in this study at a 
dose ≥250 mg/kg. 
Cardiovascular effects were investigated in vitro using HEK293 cells stably transfected with hERG. 
Maribavir had no effect on the hERG current at concentrations of up to 1500 µg/mL (measured 
concentration 1250 µg/mL), providing a wide safety margin of more than 4000-fold the anticipated 
clinical plasma unbound Cmax of 0.344 µg/mL (0.91 µM), at the maximum proposed clinical dose of 
400 mg BID. 
Effects of maribavir on cardiovascular and respiratory function was investigated in anaesthetised closed 
chest beagle male dogs after IV administration of 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg as ascending dose. Transient 
increase in heart rate and respiratory rate were observed in dogs after IV administration of maribavir. 
No exposure data are available in dogs for maribavir. Using the HED dose calculation based on body 
surface area (according to FDA-Guidance for Industry: Estimating the Maximum Safe Starting Dose in 
Assessment report  
EMA/792160/2022 
Page 21/22 
 
 
 
Adult Healthy Volunteer. Rockville, MD: US Food and Drug Administration; 2005.), the human 
equivalent dose to 30 mg/kg in dogs is 16.7 mg/kg which corresponds to a daily dose of 1000 mg in a 
60 kg person. 
In repeat-dose toxicity studies of up to 52 weeks duration in cynomolgus monkeys, maribavir had no 
effect on electrocardiography parameters at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested, 
corresponding approximately to total and free Cmax values of 11.6 and 1.9 µg/mL, respectively. To be 
compared with the clinical total and free clinical Cmax values of 17.2 and 0.344 µg/mL, respectively. 
In a clinical thorough QT study, maribavir demonstrated no adverse CV effects at 100 or 1200 mg.

bioequivalence of 3 different capsule forms shown 
The amounts of maribavir and the main metabolite VP 44469 were analysed in several validated and in 
two non-validated assays.  
Maribavir demonstrated moderate oral bioavailability in monkeys and high oral bioavailability in 
rodents. A gender difference in plasma concentration of maribavir and VP 44469 was observed in 
rodents. In the 2-year carcinogenicity study, the systemic concentration of maribavir and VP 44469 
was greater for most dose levels in male mice.  Contrary to mice, female rats exhibited higher plasma 
concentrations of maribavir and VP44469 than males (approximately x2 for maribavir), with evidence 
of slight accumulation after repeated administration. VP 44469 concentrations were lower than those 
for maribavir and barely detectable in the 2-year carcinogenicity study performed in rat. No obvious 
gender differences were observed in cynomolgus monkey of maribavir or VP 44469 exposure, 
however, indications of inter-animal variability was reported despite relatively consistency in exposure 
levels. The apparent T½ after 5 -10mg/kg IV and oral (10 mg/kg) doses was highly variable between 
non-clinical species, ranging between 0.14 to 1.18  hours in mice, 0.38 to 2.74 hours in rats, and 11.5 
Assessment report

hours in monkeys. Volume of distribution at steady state after single dose administration was 2 L/kg in 
mice, 7.3 L/kg in rat and 5.7-9.4 L/kg in cynomolgus monkey, respectively. 
In mice, rats and monkeys, plasma concentrations were greater for maribavir than for the metabolite 
VP 44469, the main human metabolite. According to a human ADME study, the monkey absorption 
parameters are more similar to humans than to rodents. 
Moderate binding of maribavir to animal plasma proteins occurred in animals in the range of: mouse 
(93.8%) > rabbit (89.7%) > monkey (89.5%) > rat (87.8%). VP 44469 less protein bound than 
maribavir in the following range: rabbit (90.9%) > monkey (78.3%) > mouse (76.1%) > rat (71.4%). 
In contrast, the protein binding in human plasma was high (98%). In all analysed samples, the free 
fractions were higher at higher concentrations. High binding to human serum albumin (84.3% to 
90.6%) and a lower binding to α1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) was observed. Due to the lower abundance 
of AAG in plasma, AAG is not considered to contribute relevantly to high extent of protein binding in 
plasma. Therefore, further binding to lipoproteins is assumed. Maribavir was also determined to 
undergo moderate covalent binding to liver microsomal proteins due to NADPH-dependent 
bioactivation, which was lowest in human with 43.6 pmol equiv/mg protein < rat (53.9) < monkey 
(79.6) <  mouse (87.1). Maribavir was significantly distributed into the cellular fraction of the blood 
with higher blood-plasma-ratios in rats (4.2) and monkeys (7.4) than in humans. 
In vivo tissue distribution was analysed after oral administration of 14C-maribavir (10 mg/kg) to 
pigmented and non-pigmented rats followed by quantitative whole-body autoradiography (QWBA). 
Extensive distribution to GI that remained high to day 7 after PO administration was observed, 
indicative of enterohepatic recirculation which was confirmed by biliary excretion into small intestine 
after IV administration. Maribavir was widely distributed throughout the body with highest levels of 
radioactivity found in the liver, kidney, kidney cortex, kidney medulla, and GI tract. Significant binding 
to melanin and long retention in the respective tissues was shown in the QWBA study. Maribavir was 
also distributed into the testes and seminal vesicles. In this QWBA study in rats, maribavir did not 
cross the blood-brain-barrier to a measurable extent but was present in the choroid plexus. Further 
evaluations in mice and especially monkeys showed a variable amount of maribavir in the brain and 
the CSF. In vitro studies with monkey brain homogenates indicated a high binding of ~97% to brain 
proteins.  
In vitro metabolism studies in pooled liver microsomes and primary hepatocytes of rat, monkey, and 
human indicated that the primary pathways for biotransformation include N-dealkylation to form 
VP 44469 (2 amino-5, 6-dichloro-1-β-L-ribofuranosyl-1Hbenzimidazole) and direct glucuronidation. 
Species differences were observed: glucuronidation is the primary metabolic pathway in rat and 
monkey hepatocytes, while human hepatocytes showed only little glucuronidation. N-dealkylation 
appearing to be the major metabolic in vitro pathway in humans. The formation of all metabolites 
except M7 (both parent + glucuronide) were almost completely inhibited by incubation with a pan-CYP 
inhibitor. VP 44469 was the major metabolite in humans (12%) and pharmacodynamic inactive. 
In human liver microsomes and hepatocytes, the metabolism of maribavir is catalyzed principally by 
CYP3A4 and to a minor extent by CYP1A2; the CYP-driven pathways include N-dealkylation to form VP 
44469 and deribosylation to M9. An in vitro study was conducted to further evaluate the role of 
CYP3A4 in the metabolism of maribavir in the formation of VP 44469. Maribavir conversion to VP 
44469 was inhibited by ketoconazole (a CYP3A4 inhibitor) and CYP3A4 neutralizing antibody 
suggesting that CYP3A4 is the principal CYP isoenzyme responsible for conversion of maribavir to VP 
44469. Further in vivo studies were undertaken to evaluate especially this DDI. Multiple UGT enzymes, 
namely UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT2B7, and possibly UGT1A9, were involved in the glucuronidation of 
maribavir in human.

EMA/792160/2022

The major metabolites of maribavir observed in vivo were also seen following incubation in HLM. In 
vivo studies show that biliary excretion and metabolism are the major routes of elimination in mice, 
rats, and monkeys. Oxidation, N-dealkylation, N-glycosidic bond hydrolysis, and glucuronidation were 
the major metabolic pathways of maribavir in vivo in all species with quantitative differences. 
VP 44469 (N-dealkylation of the isopropyl group) has been shown to be a metabolite in all species 
evaluated but with significant quantitative differences which were most obvious in vitro in microsomes 
and hepatocytes, where VP 44469 was the major metabolite in human in contrast to rat and monkey. 
The safety of VP 44469 has been assessed based on systemic exposure in mouse, rat and monkey 
toxicology studies and low exposure multiples of VP 44469 relative to NOAEL/LOAEL in toxicology were 
reached. 
Investigations of excreta consisting 14C-labelled maribavir up to 96-168 hours were performed and the 
recovery of drug-related radiolabelled material (DRM) was incomplete. 
Further investigation was performed in bile duct cannulated (BDC) and intact male cynomolgus 
monkey in 2018, (IV, 13 mg/kg, P8177M-SHP620). In intact animals, total recovery was 95.3% after 
336 hours post-dose. 14.1% and 75.2% of the administered dose was recovered in urine and faeces, 
respectively. The majority of the radioactivity was eliminated by 96 hours, but low levels were still 
detectable by 312-336 hour post-dose.  
In BDC animals, total recovery was 97% at 168 hours post-dose. Elimination via bile was 84% while 
5.16% and 2.36% was eliminated via urine and faeces, respectively. However, low levels of 
radioactivity were still detectable in urine and faeces by 168 hours suggesting a low level of retention 
in tissues with slow release over time. 
In monkeys, the major route of elimination was direct glucuronidation, whereas N-dealkylation to form 
VP 44469 was a comparatively minor pathway. After biliary secretion into the GI tract lumen, 
maribavir glucuronides were subsequently converted to the parent drug and reabsorbed, leading to 
apparent enterohepatic recirculation similar to the observations in rats. 
The in vitro DDI related experiments are further discussed in relation to the in vivo data below.  
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
The non-clinical safety of maribavir was investigated according to ICH-M3 (R2) requirements. Mice, 
rats and monkeys were chosen for single and repeat-dose toxicity studies because the main human 
metabolite of maribavir, VP 44469 was present in all of them and these species are common species 
for toxicity testing. 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
Single dose toxicity studies performed in mice and rats with oral and IV application of maribavir 
showed lethality and clinical signs like prostration, convulsions and decreased activity. No gross 
treatment related findings were observed in mice that died moribund or were sacrificed. In decedent 
rats, pathology findings related to the stomach/intestines, lungs and heart. 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies were performed in mice, rats and monkeys. Maribavir was applied orally 
once a day to mice and rats, and according to the clinical treatment schedule twice a day to monkeys. 
In general, dose range finding studies preceded the pivotal studies. Pivotal studies were performed 
according to GLP. Toxicokinetic data for maribavir and the main metabolite VP 44469 were collected

DRF: dose range finding, qd: once a day, SD: Sprague Dawley 
Mice - In the pivotal 13-week study in mice, doses of 300 and 500 mg/kg/day were not very well 
tolerated. The high dose group was therefore terminated early. Clinical signs associated with 
gastrointestinal effects were observed in decedents and surviving animals. Haematological changes in 
the form of higher platelet and reticulocyte counts and relative increase in spleen weights associated 
with splenic haematopoiesis were noticed. Gastrointestinal lesions included mucosal hyperplasia and 
inflammation of the cecum and/or colon and the non-/glandular stomach. Findings showed 
reversibility. The NOAEL was established at 150 mg/kg/day resulting in a margin of exposure of 0.4-
times for total and 3-times for free unbound maribavir to the therapeutic exposure based on AUC. 
According to toxicokinetic data obtained in mice, systemic exposure to both, maribavir and VP 44469 
was approximately dose-proportional with no evidence of accumulation. No gender differences in 
exposure were noticed for maribavir whereas for VP 44469 exposure was higher in males than in 
females. Exposure to maribavir was in general greater than to VP 44469. 
Rat - In the rat, two pivotal studies were performed; a 30-day and a 26-week study. Mucosal 
hyperplasia in the GI-tract at all doses was the main finding observed in the 30-day study. Dose-
dependent haematology changes (increases in white blood cells and reticulocytes) and splenic 
erythropoiesis contributing to increases in erythropoietic foci in the liver of high dose females were also 
noticed. No NOAEL could be established. The exposure at the LOAEL was below the human therapeutic 
Assessment report  
EMA/792160/2022 
Page 27/28 
 
 
 
 
exposure for total and around 2-times the human therapeutic exposure for free unbound maribavir 
based on AUC. 
In the 26-week study, several animals were found dead or had to be sacrificed moribund. Although a 
relation to treatment was not excluded, the cause of death could not be determined. Histopathological 
findings concerned mucosal hyperplasia and mucosal lymphocyte infiltrates in different segments of 
the small and large intestine. Renal cortical tubule pigment deposition which did not impact renal 
function was also noticed in treated animals. Hepatocellular cytoplasmic alterations accompanied by 
increases in liver weights were attributed to induction in drug metabolizing liver enzymes which was 
shown by liver microsome analysis. Furthermore, changes in haematological parameters, which 
indicate a regenerative anaemia, and changes in clinical parameters were not considered clinically 
significant. Changes were slight and did not increase or decrease over time. The NOAEL was set at 25 
mg/kg/day resulting in exposures below human therapeutic exposures for total (approximately 0.1-
times) and free unbound (approximately 0.5-times) maribavir based on AUC. 
Toxicokinetics in rats showed that exposure to maribavir (approximately 2-fold) and VP 44469 (up to 
10-times) was higher in females compared to males and increased in proportion with dose. There was 
some evidence of maribavir accumulation after repeat-dosing. Exposure to maribavir was much higher 
than to VP 44469. 
Monkey - Altogether, three pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies were performed in the cynomolgus 
monkey. In the 30-day study, no treatment related changes were noticed at all up to the highest dose 
of 90 mg/kg BID applied. However, margins of exposure at the NOAEL were below (0.2-times for total) 
or slightly above (1.8 times for free) therapeutic maribavir exposures based on AUC. 
Relating to the toxicokinetic data of the 30-day and two pharmacokinetic studies, doses for the 
subsequently performed 26-week study were chosen. However, exposure data from day 1 indicated 
lower exposures than expected. Therefore, doses were doubled after the first three weeks of 
treatment. Severe diarrhoea associated with poor condition of some mid and high dose animals was 
counteracted with dosing holidays of 11 up to 30 days until recovery. Reversible decreases in red blood 
cell counts with increases in reticulocytes were observed, which can be attributed to regenerative 
anaemia. Histopathology findings concerned the GI-tract with mucosal hyperplasia of the cecum, colon 
and rectum. A NOAEL could not be established. The LOAEL of 25/50 mg/kg BID results in a margin of 
exposure below or at human therapeutic maribavir exposures based on AUC. 
In the 52-week repeat-dose toxicity study, again severe diarrhoea resulting in dehydration occurred 
with a dose-related incidence and severity. Maribavir administration was therefore discontinued for the 
high dose group for weeks 10 to 13 and the dose was reduced. However, at the end of 8 months of 
study, treatment was completely discontinued for high dose animals and animals were euthanised. 
Furthermore, dose administration was temporarily suspended for selected animals of all dose groups. 
Epithelial hyperplasia of the cecum, colon and rectum was noticed for animals of all dose groups. 
Haematological alterations noticed were considered to be secondary to diarrhoea and dehydration. 
Furthermore, a treatment-related decrease in alkaline phosphatase was seen in high dose animals. No 
NOAEL could be established. Maribavir exposure at the LOAEL of 50 mg/kg BID was below (0.3-times) 
for total and approximately 2-times for unbound at the therapeutic levels based on AUC. 
High inter animal variability was noticed for toxicokinetics in monkeys. Maribavir exposure increased in 
a less than dose proportional manner in the 52-week study and showed no sex-related difference. VP 
44469 exposure values seem to increase in proportion with dose for low and mid dose, but not for the 
high dose group. AUC and Cmax values for VP 44469 demonstrated a statistically significant trend 
towards higher values in females than in males.  
Assessment report  
EMA/792160/2022 
Page 28/29 
 
 
 
Altogether, the main target organ for maribavir toxicity observed across animal species is the 
gastrointestinal tract leading to severe diarrhoea and dehydration with secondary erythroid 
haematological changes. Haematological changes in monkeys, rats and mice can be attributed to 
regenerative anaemia. In the longer-term studies in monkeys, maribavir toxicity resulted in dose 
reductions, dosing holidays and/or earlier termination of severely affected dose groups. Margins of 
exposure to the established NOAELs or LOAELs were in general either below or only slightly above 
human therapeutic exposures for maribavir based on AUC for all animal species. 
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
Maribavir was negative in in vitro Ames tests, weakly positive in the L5178Y/tk+/- mouse lymphoma 
test without metabolic activation (- S9) and equivocal with metabolic activation (+ S9). Without 
metabolic activation a small increase in small colony mutant frequency was observed caused probably 
by chromosome damage effects (clastogenic). No cytotoxicity or increased mutagenicity at exposures 
> 3 x Cmax were observed with metabolic activation. In an in vivo micronucleus test performed in > 3 
x the clinical exposure (Cmax unbound), maribavir showed no statistically significant increase in the 
number of micronucleated PCE’s as compared to the vehicle and no cytotoxicity (bone marrow) could 
be observed in any treatment group. Maribavir showed no clastogenic effects in vivo.  
In conclusion, maribavir is not considered to be genotoxic under the conditions of the studies. An 
appropriate wording was implemented in section 5.3 in the SPC. 
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
According to the current guideline ICH S1 long-term carcinogenicity testing of maribavir was carried 
out in two 2-year lifespan studies in rodents [mouse Crl:CD1(ICR) M9526M-SHP620 and rat 
Crl:WI(Han) R9581M-SHP620] in compliance with GLP. Toxicokinetic data for maribavir and the main 
metabolite VP 44469 were collected for both studies. 
Neoplastic findings of both rodents were reported in the literature and generally, the incidence of each 
neoplasm was within historical control ranges with the exception of vascular neoplasms 
(haemangiosarcomas) detected in male mice (12.9 % to historical control). Further, the incidence of 
combined haemangiomas/haemangiosarcomas in multiple organs in male mice was 4/60 (6.7%), 1/60 
(1.7%), 4/60 (6.7%), 5/78 (6.4%) and 14/77 (18%) at 0, 0, 25, 75 and 150 mg/kg/day, respectively, 
indicating an increased incidence at 150 mg/kg/day. The Applicant is of the opinion that the result was 
considered an equivocal test article-related biological effect for the following reasons:  (1) the 
incidence of haemangiosarcoma only marginally exceeded that reported for CD-1 historical controls; 
(2) the difficulty in assessing the impact of adding at risk mice to Groups 4 and 5 after one year, (3) 
there was no increase in vascular neoplasms in female test article groups; (4) the morphology of the 
vascular neoplasms in male mice were similar to that seen in control mice of this study. 
However, despite of the lack of any neoplastic proliferative effects in a chronic toxicity study (13 w) in 
mice, the absence of a genotoxic potential and a clear difference in duration of administration 
compared to the clinical dosing, the result was of uncertain relevance in terms of its translation to 
human risk and therefore considered equivocal. Neoplastic alterations in rat (age, strain) detected in 
control and treatment groups were not dose dependent or statistically significant and were expected in 
carcinogenicity studies of this duration. 
Nevertheless, for both rodents, exposure margins obtained at the NOAEL for carcinogenicity are not 
existing (< 1 x) or rather low (1 – 2 x) with regard to the total concentrations or free concentrations of

maribavir based on AUC. Considering the proposed indication, the low exposure multiples should not 
be a concern. This information is indicated in the relevant section 5.3 of the SPC. 
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
In line with the proposed indication “Treatment of adults with post-transplant cytomegalovirus (CMV) 
infection and/or disease who are resistant and/or refractory to one or more prior therapy including 
ganciclovir, valganciclovir, cidofovir or foscarnet”, a full range of reproductive toxicity studies was 
conducted in the late 1990s. All pivotal studies were carried out in accordance with the relevant 
guideline of that time (ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline 1993) and in compliance with GLP 
regulations.  
In rats, male and female fertility was not affected at all by maribavir treatment at doses up to 400 
mg/kg/day although in male rats, a decreased straight-line velocity of sperm was observed at all 
maribavir dose levels.  
Embryofoetal and maternal toxicity was already evident at the lowest dose of 100 mg/kg/day. No 
substance related teratogenicity was observed up to the highest dose tested. In addition, prenatal and 
postnatal development was not affected by oral treatment of dams with maribavir at the low dose of 
50 mg/kg/day during gestation and lactation. Treatment with higher dosages during these periods 
were associated with adverse effects on pups’ body weights and correspondent delayed attainment of 
developmental milestones. Learning and memory as well as fertility and mating performance, the 
ability to maintain pregnancy and to deliver live offspring together with the survival of the offspring to 
day 4 postpartum, remained unaffected in the offspring up to the top dose of 400 mg/kg/day. 
Treatment of pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis induced no maternal and no 
embryofoetal toxicity up to the highest dose tested (100 mg/kg/day). 
Exposure multiples obtained in the reproductive toxicity studies at the respective NOAELs/LOAELs are 
often < 1 when compared to the human exposure, at least with regard to the total maribavir 
concentrations. Comparison of the free and unbound concentrations at the NOEALs/LOAELs with the 
human free and unbound fraction revealed somewhat higher exposure multiples. Considering the 
proposed indication “Treatment of adults with post-transplant cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and/or 
disease who are resistant and/or refractory to one or more prior therapy, including ganciclovir, 
valganciclovir, cidofovir or foscarnet” as “last line therapy”, the low exposure multiples are not 
considered a concern. The information provided in section 5.3 of the SmPC adequately reflects this 
fact. Regarding section 4.6 of the SmPC the wording is considered to be in line with the respective 
guideline. 
2.5.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
Described in above sections. 
2.5.4.7.  Local Tolerance  
According to the Guideline on non-clinical local tolerance testing of medicinal products 
(EMA/CHMP/SWP/2145/2000 Rev. 1, Corr. 1*), local tolerance studies are considered unnecessary for 
medicinal products administered by oral route. In studies on dermal and ocular tolerance and skin 
sensitisation maribavir was not considered as a dermal irritant in rats and rabbits but as a slight ocular 
irritant in rabbits and was classified as a non-sensitiser to guinea-pig skin. These studies are of limited 
clinical relevance for the intended oral route of administration of maribavir.

2.5.4.8.  Other toxicity studies 
Phototoxicity 
Maribavir was distributed in uveal tract of the eye and skin and exhibited affinity for melanin in 
pigmented rats with molar extinction coefficient (MEC) greater than the ICH S10 threshold (1000 Lmol-
1/cm) in the UVB spectrum ( ∼ 216, 270 and 300 nm). Maribavir was not phototoxic in the in vitro 3T3 
NRU-PT study conducted according to standard conditions using a xenon arc solar simulator as the 
source of UVA exposure, equipped with a Schott WG 320 filter. Given that penetration of UVB light into 
human skin is mainly limited to the epidermis, while UVA can reach capillary blood, the clinical 
relevance of photochemical activation by UVB is considered less important than activation by UVA for 
systemic drugs as outlined in ICH S10. In conclusion, the risk for phototoxicity is considered low. 
Antigenicity 
No specific studies have been performed. Maribavir was classified as a non-sensitiser to guinea-pig 
skin. 
Immunotoxicity 
The potential immunotoxicity of maribavir was investigated in female Sprague-Dawley rats in an acute 
immunotoxicity study including a functional evaluation of the immunoglobulin antibody-forming cell 
(AFC) response to the T-dependent antigen and sheep red blood cells in the spleen at dosages of 10, 
30 and 100 mg/kg/day (5, 15 and 50 mg/kg BID) for 7 days. Treatment with maribavir leads to 
significant increase in spleen weight at 100mg/kg. Furthermore, splenic specific and total IgM AFCs 
response significantly increased at ≥ 30 mg/kg. However, given the variability and overlap in individual 
animal data across all dose groups including the vehicle group, the lack of dose-response to the 
potential immunostimulatory responses in 30 and 100 mg/kg/day dose groups, and no specific 
immunomodulatory responses in the repeat-dose tox studies, the potential for maribavir-mediated 
immunotoxicity is deemed low. 
Dependence 
No specific dependence studies have been performed with maribavir. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The ERA provided for Maribavir is considered complete and acceptable.  
The calculation of the predicted environmental concentration (PEC) in Phase I for the active substance 
Maribavir has been based on prevalences. The PECsurface water value exceeds the action limit of 10 
ng/l. Consequently, a respective Phase II environmental risk assessment was performed by the 
applicant and submitted with an updated ERA. 
Maribavir is not a PBT substance but should be classified as a vP substance. 
PEC/PNEC calculation for surface water, groundwater, microorganisms and sediment revealed that 
maribavir does not pose a risk to the respective compartments.  
As a result of the above considerations, Livtencity with the API maribavir does not present a risk to the 
environment when used according to SmPC and PL.

2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Considering the above data, maribavir is not expected to pose a risk to the environment when used 
according to SmPC and PL. 
Animal in vivo models for pharmacodynamic effects of maribavir are of limited relevance due to the 
species-specify of CMV and therefore not further discussed. 
The secondary pharmacodynamic studies were conducted in 1996 and are therefore of older origin. 
Maribavir was investigated on its broad pharmacological effects on the CNS, CV, and GI systems, as 
well as on metabolic, inflammation and allergy, microbiological activity. The study reports are of low 
quality and a thorough assessment of the reports is not possible. 
Maribavir showed anticholinergic and antihistaminergic activity in vitro at 10 µM (3.76 µg/mL) in 
guinea pig ileum. The concentration used is approximately 10-fold the unbound clinical Cmax level of 
0.91 µM. Antihistaminergic and anticholinergic activity of maribavir are also proposed by the applicant 
for the effects seen in the safety pharmacology study in mice on CNS.  
A core battery of in vivo and in vitro safety pharmacology studies was performed with maribavir. These 
included studies on effects on central nervous, cardiovascular (in vivo and in vitro) and respiratory 
systems. The in vivo safety pharmacology studies were conducted in 1996 and are therefore of older 
origin. Whereas the in vitro hERG assay was performed under GLP, the in vivo safety pharmacology 
studies have not been performed under GLP. As outlined in the ICH S7A guideline, the safety 
pharmacology core battery should ordinarily be conducted in compliance with GLP. The applicant 
justifies that except for the hERG study, the safety pharmacology studies were conducted prior to the 
introduction of ICH S7A guidance and were therefore not Good Laboratory Practice (GLP-)compliant. 
However, the studies were conducted in reputable laboratories, using suitable group sizes to allow 
Assessment report  
EMA/792160/2022 
Page 33/34 
 
 
 
 
 
adequate statistical analysis of the results. Therefore, the applicant concludes that the overall safety 
pharmacology assessment is considered to be robust. Considering that the in vivo safety pharmacology 
studies have been performed prior to introduction of the ICH S7A guideline and in view of the available 
GLP-compliant single-and repeated dose toxicity studies and the clinical studies the lack of GLP 
compliance is acceptable. 
Maribavir induced pronounced effects on the CNS (hypoactivity, hypothermia, blepharospasm, tremors, 
ataxia and variable changes in respiration rate) in a behavioral study in CD-1 male mice at oral doses ≥ 
250 mg/kg. Clinical signs of CNS-related effects (hypoactivity, convulsion, tremors, respiration 
changes) were also seen in a range of single and repeat dose toxicity studies in mice, rats and 
monkeys at clinically relevant exposures. Penetration into CNS of maribavir cannot be excluded (see 
pharmacokinetics) and CNS-related adverse reactions like taste disorder have been very commonly 
seen in clinical studies.  
Significant binding and retention of maribavir in melanin-containing tissue was further analysed for its 
in vitro phototoxic potential.  
Maribavir showed a moderate binding to plasma proteins in animals and a high binding in humans. 
Since the very high extent could not only be attributed to the binding to HSA and AAG, a relevant 
binding to lipoproteins is expected and a relevant covalent binding to liver microsomes (human < 
animals) was shown. In the conducted repeat-dose toxicity studies no obvious liver toxicity was 
determined. The conclusion of a low clinical risk due to covalent binding to human liver microsomes is 
therefore followed. Maribavir was significantly distributed into the cellular fraction of the blood with 
higher blood-to-plasma-ratios. 
CYP and UGT-related metabolism was adequately analysed in rats, monkeys, mice. However, 
limitations in the analysis of human metabolism are still present. Significant inter-species differences 
were identified in vitro in liver microsomes and hepatocytes. Due to a relevant enterohepatic 
deconjugation and recirculation these differences were not so distinct in vivo, with a relevant exposure 
of VP 44469, the main human metabolite in the repeat-dose, reproductive toxicity and in 
carcinogenicity studies. Thus, the metabolite is considered qualified in non-clinical studies. 
A comprehensive quantitative comparison of the inter-species differences for relevant circulating and 
excreted metabolites was provided for the non-clinical species in comparison to humans. Maribavir 
showed species-dependent metabolism and excretion patterns.  Most obviously, excretion of drug-
related radioactivity into the urine was a major route of elimination in humans while being only a minor 
route of elimination in the analysed non-clinical species. However, due to missing respective clinical 
safety signals this gap of non-clinical information was concluded of minor overall clinical relevance.  
It should also be noted that in humans after a single oral dose of 14C-maribavir, 75% of drug-related 
material is recovered, with 61% in urine and 14% in faeces. Thus 25% of the dose is thus unaccounted 
for and may potentially be unidentified metabolites. This is further discussed in section 3.3.3. 
Maribavir was majorly eliminated by biliary and fecal excretion in animals. The renal route was a 
relevant route for some metabolites, with a low contribution to the total excretion.  
Maribavir has a high potential for PK-related DDI through metabolising enzymes and transporters, in 
vitro.  
In the section 3, Drug-drug interactions, the Applicant refers a wide therapeutic window of up to 1200 
mg maribavir BID corresponding to Cmax and AUC0-Ƭ of approximately 36.7 µg/mL and 379 µg·h/mL, 
respectively. These Cmax and AUC exposures have not generally been reached in the non-clinical safety 
studies, and thus, the non-clinical study package provides no support for this wide therapeutic window. 
Assessment report  
EMA/792160/2022 
Page 34/35 
 
 
 
However, this exposure is covered by both the 800 mg and 1200 mg phase 2 studies and may 
therefore be acceptable based on clinical safety data. 
The toxicology programme was adequate in general. Repeated-dose toxicity studies were 
performed in rodents (mice and rats) and non-rodents (cynomolgus monkeys) for sufficiently long 
duration, up to 26 weeks in rats and up to 52 weeks in monkeys. Dose-range finding studies preceded 
all of the pivotal studies in the three animal species. Pivotal studies were performed according to GLP. 
Toxicokinetic data were obtained for maribavir and the main metabolite VP 44469 within most of these 
studies. 
Genotoxicity and Carcinogenicity studies submitted are considered sufficient for characterisation 
of the genotoxic and carcinogenic potential of maribavir. In the rat carcinogenicity study, there were 
no neoplasms attributed to maribavir treatment. In the mouse carcinogenicity study, the incidence of 
combined haemangiomas/haemangiosarcomas in multiple organs in male animals only was 4/60 
(6.7%), 1/60 (1.7%), 4/60 (6.7%), 5/78 (6.4%) and 14/77 (18%) at 0, 0, 25, 75 and 150 
mg/kg/day, respectively, indicating an increased incidence at 150 mg/kg/day. The Applicant of the 
opinion that these findings are equivocal with one of the arguments put forward is the addition of 
satellite animals to Groups 4 and 5 after one year. The Applicant was asked to provide further 
arguments supporting this position (as example separate analysis of vascular neoplasms in the former 
satellite animals in comparison with the main study animals). Based on a separate analysis on the 
incidence of haemangiomas and haemangiosarcomas of the satellite animals moved into the main 
study, there is no strong support for the argument that moving of satellite animals to Groups 4 (75 
mg/kg/day) and 5 (150 mg/kg/day) after one year have confounded the findings of haemangiomas 
and haemangiosarcomas in the study. The findings are considered adequately presented in section 5.3 
of the SmPC. 
Exposure margins obtained at the NOAEL for carcinogenicity are not existing or rather low with regard 
to the total concentrations or free concentrations of maribavir based on AUC. Considering the proposed 
indication and the limited treatment duration, the low exposure multiples should not be a concern.  
The reproductive toxicity studies submitted are considered sufficient for characterisation of the 
reproductive potential of maribavir, despite the maximum tolerated dose was apparently not achieved 
in pregnant rabbits, as no maternal toxicity occurred. However, two DRF studies, one in non-pregnant 
and another in pregnant rabbits preceded the pivotal study and dosages for the pivotal study were 
selected on the results of these studies.  
There were no apparent effects on male and female fertility, although a decreased straightline velocity 
of sperm was observed in all maribavir treatment groups. The reversibility of this effect is not known. 
Given the absence of findings in all other semen parameters (actual path velocity, total counts, % 
motility and sperm morphology), in male reproductive tract organ weights and histopathology, and in 
fertility parameters, the biological significance seems low. The observation is presented in the SmPC 
which is endorsed. Furthermore, the clinical relevance for the intended patient population is regarded 
as low. Most patients have been treated with ganciclovir, valganciclovir, cidofovir or foscarnet, all of 
which have clear genotoxic potential and ganciclovir, valganciclovir and cidofovir also have adverse 
effects on spermatogenesis in animals. 
HanWistar rats, a strain generally used for toxicity studies at that time, were used for the combined 
FEED and EFD study as well as for the PPND study. According to the study report of the combined 
study, this strain is associated with a so-called “cleft palate syndrome”, a fact, that could have made 
the interpretation of the foetal findings more difficult. Foetuses with cleft palates were indeed found 
not only in the combined FEED and EFD study but also in the PPND study, with the highest incidence in 
each study in the respective control groups, which excludes a maribavir related effect. 
Assessment report  
EMA/792160/2022 
Page 35/36 
 
 
 
Exposure margins obtained at the NOAEL/LOAEL in the reproductive toxicity studies are rather low 
especially with regard to comparison of the total concentrations. Comparison of the free and unbound 
concentrations at the NOAEL/LOAEL revealed somewhat higher margins. However, considering the 
proposed indication “Treatment of adults with post-transplant cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and/or 
disease who are resistant and/or refractory to one or more prior therapy, including ganciclovir, 
valganciclovir, cidofovir or foscarnet” as a “last line therapy”, the low exposure multiples should not be 
a concern as the fact is indicated in the relevant sections of the SmPC. 
The proposed labelling for the relevant SmPC sections 4.6 and 5.3 adequately reflects the results 
except the NOAEL for maternal toxicity in rats, and the wording for section 4.6 is in line with the 
relevant guideline. Indeed, the non-existent or low safety margins are clearly indicated in section 5.3 
of the SmPC. 
Two pivotal juvenile toxicity studies were submitted, too. However, at present there is no application 
for paediatric treatment.  A critical assessment of these studies will be done at a later stage. 
Based on the results of an immunotoxicity study in female rats and the lack of specific 
immunomodulatory response in the repeat-dose toxicity studies, the potential for maribavir-mediated 
immunotoxicity is deemed low. 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In general, the non-clinical programme sufficiently addressed the pharmacokinetics (ADME) in animals 
in vivo and human in vitro.  
Overall, the non-clinical programme sufficiently characterises the toxicity of maribavir. The study 
results of the repeat-dose toxicity, genotoxicity studies as well as the low and / or non-existent safety 
margins at the respective NOAELs/LOAELs are adequately reflected in the relevant sections of the 
SmPC.  
The proposed labelling for the relevant SmPC sections 4.6 and 5.3 adequately reflects the results 
except the NOAEL for maternal toxicity in rats, and the wording for section 4.6 is in line with the 
relevant guideline. Indeed, the non-existent or low safety margins are clearly indicated in section 5.3 
of the SmPC. 
ERA was completed and no risk to the environment when used according to SmPC and PL concluded 
for maribavir.

GCP aspects 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
A triggered GCP inspection for the clinical study SHP 620-303 was conducted. The final integrated 
inspection report of the sponsor inspection and two clinical sites in Belgium and Germany was provided 
on the 17th of March. At the sponsor site one critical, twelve major and three minor findings were 
identified. At the investigator site in Belgium, one major and six minor findings were issued, while at 
the investigator site in Germany, three major and six minor findings were identified. The findings of 
the GCP inspections are highlighted in the relevant sections.

The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
Community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
The clinical development of maribavir comprises 17 Phase I studies, 3 Phase II studies and 3 Phase III 
studies with five different oral immediate-release (IR) formulations (one capsule and four tablet 
formulations). Tablet IV formulation was used in the pivotal Phase III study (SHP620-303) and has the 
same composition as the to-be-marketed product. The applied dose is 400 mg twice daily. 
Three initial safety, tolerability and intravitreal distribution studies were conducted in HIV patients 
when maribavir was evaluated as a potential treatment for CMV retinitis. All other Phase I studies, with 
the exception of the renal and hepatic impairment studies and a DDI study with tacrolimus, were 
conducted in healthy patients.  
A summary of all clinical studies conducted with maribavir is shown in below.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
•  Bioavailability 
An intravenous formulation of maribavir was not developed due to the low aqueous solubility of the 
active substance. Thus, absolute bioavailability has not been determined.  
Orally administered maribavir is rapidly absorbed with mean peak plasma concentrations of 1 to 3 h 
post-dose.  
Following the applied dose of 400 mg BID, the terminal half-life (t1/2) of maribavir was 3.87 h in 
healthy patients (studies 1263-100, 1263-110 and SHP620-115) and 4.32 h in transplant patients 
(study SHP620-202). 
PK parameters of maribavir following a single dose of tablet formulations II, III and IV are shown in 
table below,(studies 1263-104, 1263-109, TAK-620-1019). 
Table 4 Descriptive statistics for pharmacokinetic parameters of maribavir following a single oral dose 
of maribavir via formulations Tablet II, Tablet III and Tablet IV in healthy patients (studies 1263-104, 
1263-109, TAK-620-1019) 
In study 1263-109 the relative bioavailability of crushed and whole maribavir tablets (Tablet III 
formulation) was determined to evaluate if maribavir can also administered crushed, e.g. via 
nasogastric tube (NG) in case patients are not able to swallow the tablets during recovery from 
transplant surgery. AUC and Cmax of crushed and whole tablets administered under fasting conditions 
were comparable and the 90% CIs were within the bioequivalence interval of 0.8 to 1.25. 
•  Bioequivalence 
Study 1263-104 
During clinical development five different oral IR formulations of maribavir were used. However, 
bioequivalence was only investigated for Tablet I and Tablet II under fasting conditions in study 1263-
104. The systemic exposures in terms of AUC and Cmax following administration of a single oral dose of 
400 mg maribavir (Tablet I and Tablet II) were comparable and the 90% CIs were within the 
Assessment report  
EMA/792160/2022 
Page 42/43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
bioequivalence acceptance range of 80-125%. Median Tmax occurred after 1.5 h for both formulations 
(Table 5).  
Table 5 Statistical analysis of the pharmacokinetic parameters of maribavir following a single oral dose 
of 400 mg tablet I or tablet II under fasted conditions (study 1263-104) 
For bridging between different formulations used during clinical development, the applicant performed 
a post-hoc analysis comparing the pharmacokinetic parameters after a 400 mg maribavir dose under 
fasting conditions (Table 6). 
According to this analysis the geometric mean ratios for AUC0-∞ after a single dose are all close to 1 
(0.98 to 1.08), however, the 90% CI are not in the bioequivalence range of 0.8 to 1.25.  
The Cmax values were equivalent between Tablet III and Tablet IV; however, Tablet III and Tablet IV 
had 40% and 35%, higher Cmax, respectively, compared to Tablet II, along with slightly shorter Tmax.

Influence of food 
The effect of food on the PK of maribavir was investigated for the capsule and Tablet II formulation.  
Study CMAB1002 
Administration of maribavir capsule with a high fat, high caloric meal (fat: 67 g, carbohydrate: 58 g, 
protein: 33 g) decreased Cmax and AUC and delayed the time of maximum maribavir concentration 
(Tmax) by about 2 h. The ratio of geometric mean (fed/fasted) were 0.715 (90% CI: 0.61, 0.84) for 
Cmax and 0.729 (90% CI: 0.58, 0.91) for AUC0-∞ (Table 7).  
Table 7 Statistical analysis of the pharmacokinetic parameters of maribavir following a single oral dose 
of 400 mg maribavir (capsule) under fed and fasted conditions (study CMAB1002) 
Study 1263-104 
Results from the statistical analysis of the maribavir PK parameters following a single-dose of  
400 mg (Tablet II) under moderate-fat and fasted conditions are presented in table below. Based on 
the ratio of geometric means of the two treatments, Cmax was 28% lower when maribavir was 
administered with food. AUC values, although 14% lower when maribavir was administered under 
moderate-fat conditions, can still be considered as bioequivalent with 90% CI of 0.8-0.93. Tmax was 
prolonged from 1.5 h to 2 h (Table 8). 
Table 8  Statistical analysis of the pharmacokinetic parameters of maribavir following a single oral dose 
of 400 mg maribavir Tablet II under fed (moderate-fat) and fasted conditions (study 1263-104) 
The results of studies CMAB1002 and 1263-104 indicate that the systemic exposure of maribavir 
depends on the fat content of the meal. However, Ctrough (most relevant PK parameter for antiviral

activity) seems not to be impacted by food based on available data and thus administration of 
maribavir without regard to food is considered acceptable. 
Distribution 
Maribavir is highly bound to plasma proteins. Ex vivo protein binding of maribavir (98.5-99.0%) was 
consistent with in vitro binding (98.0%), with no apparent difference observed between different study 
populations, i.e. healthy patients, patients with hepatic (moderate) or renal (mild/moderate or severe) 
impairment, HIV patients, or CMV-seropositive transplant patients. 
Plasma protein binding for the maribavir main metabolite VP44469 was 89.7 to 92.4% ex vivo. 
Elimination 
Following administration of a [14C]-maribavir solution, unchanged maribavir was the principal drug-
related species circulating in plasma, and maribavir’s despropyl metabolite (M4, VP 44469) accounts 
for the remainder of the circulating systemic radioactivity for the first 24 hours after drug 
administration.  
75% (ranging from 59% to 88%) of the drug-related material was recovered, the majority within 24 to 
48 h after drug administration. The main metabolite identified in urine and faeces was VP 44469, 
accounting for 34.0% and 7.2% of the dose, respectively. The unchanged drug accounted for 1.8% 
and 5.7% of the dose in urine and faeces, respectively. M1, M2, M3, M5 and M6 (Figure 2) were 
identified as minor metabolites in urine, and no other metabolites than VP 44469 was identified in 
faeces. 
Metabolism 
Following oral administration, maribavir is primarily eliminated by hepatic metabolism followed by 
urinary and faecal excretion of the metabolites. 
The proposed metabolic scheme for maribavir in humans is shown in Figure 22. Metabolic pathways 
include N-dealkylation of the isopropyl moiety to form VP 44469 (M4) followed by glucuronide 
conjugation to yield M1, hydrolysis to lose ribose and subsequent formation of glucuronides M2 and M3 
and oxidation of the isopropyl amine moiety to form metabolites M5 and M6.  
Formation of VP 44469 is mainly mediated by CYP3A4 with some contribution from CYP1A2. 
Multiple UGT enzymes, namely UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT2B7, and possibly UGT1A9, are involved in the 
glucuronidation of maribavir in humans.

Population PK Analysis for Phases 1 through 3 Studies, including 303 (Final PopPK Analysis) 
A PopPK model was developed to describe the time course of maribavir concentrations in plasma in 
healthy volunteers, subjects with hepatic impairment, subjects with renal impairment, stable renal 
transplant patients, and haematopoietic SCT or SOT patients with CMV infections using NONMEM 
(version 7.4.3). The following covariates were evaluated for their impact on the PK of maribavir: age, 
body weight, body mass index (BMI), age category, gender, race, health status, study, diarrhoea, 
vomiting, dose, disease characteristics (transplant type, baseline plasma CMV DNA category, CMV 
category [asymptomatic CMV infection, CMV organ disease and symptomatic CMV infection], hepatic 
impairment, presence of CMV mutations, baseline use of antilymphocyte antibody, episode of 
qualifying infection, prior use of CMV prophylaxis, GI GVHD), concurrent medications of strong CYP3A 
inhibitors, concurrent medications of strong CYP3A inducers, concurrent medications of acid-reducing 
agents such as H2 blockers (H2B), proton pump inhibitors (PPI) and antacids. Although various solid 
formulations were used in clinical trials, formulation was not evaluated as a covariate in the PopPK 
analysis. 
The final PK model was a two-compartment disposition model with first-order absorption and 
elimination, and an absorption lag-time. The model included CYP3A inhibitor and inducer effects on

CL/F, dose effect on absorption rate constant (Ka) and patients with CMV effect on CL/F. In addition, 
CL/F, Vc/F, apparent volume of peripheral compartment (Vp/F) and inter compartment clearance 
between central and peripheral compartments (Q/F) all increased with weight fixed to allometric 
scalars. The parameters from the final population PK model are defined below and the parameter

CL/F was estimated to be 30% lower in the presence of strong CYP3A inhibitors and 2.24-fold higher in 
the presence of strong CYP3A inducers, consistent with the findings from Studies 1263-102 and 1263-
110, respectively  
CL/F was estimated to be 24% lower for transplant patients with CMV compared to all other subjects, 
3.77 L/hr and 2.85 L/hr for healthy volunteers and transplant patients with CMV, respectively. The 
estimates of IIV were small to moderate (CV ranged from 34% to 53%) for all parameters apart from 
Q/F, Vp/F and Ka (91% to 152%). The shrinkages of individual random effects were estimated as 6%

Intra- and inter-subject variability in AUC0-∞ and Cmax were determined in studies 1263-104 (Tablet I 
and Tablet II formulation) and 1263-109 (Tablet III formulation). 
The inter-subject variability of maribavir was moderate for Cmax and AUC0-∞, with %CV ranging from 
18.3% to 34.0% and from 36.0% to 36.2%, respectively. The intra-subject variability for Cmax and  
AUC0-∞ was lower, ranging from 18.5% to 21.1% and from 11.8% to 16.1%, respectively.  
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Some serial PK samples were taken in the Phase II studies 1263-200, SHP620-202 and SHP620-203, 
in which maribavir doses up to 1200 mg BID (Tablet I and II formulation) were investigated in adult 
transplant recipients.

Impaired renal function 
Study 1263-101 
Study 1263-101 was an open-label, parallel group, single-dose study to evaluate the effect of renal 
impairment on the PK of maribavir. Thirty-one (31) adult patients with either normal renal function 
(CLcr >80 ml/min) or varying degrees of renal impairment (mild: CLcr 50-80 ml/min, moderate: CLcr 
30 - <50 ml/min, severe: CLcr <30 ml/min) were enrolled. A single 400 mg maribavir dose (Tablet I) 
was administered under fasting conditions on Day 1.   
Groups with mild and moderate renal impairment were merged due to small sample size per group. 
The PK results for the three renal function groups are shown in Table 11 and the statistical analysis for 
maribavir AUC and Cmax in Table 12.

No clinically significant effect of mild/moderate (CLcr between 30 and 80 ml/min) or severe (CLcr  
≤30 ml/min) renal impairment was observed on maribavir total PK parameters following a single dose 
of 400 mg maribavir. No dose adjustment is proposed. 
For VP 44469, AUC values for mild/moderate renal impairment and severe renal impairment groups 
were about 2 times higher while clearance values were about 2 times lower compared to the respective 
values for the normal renal function group. These increases in VP 44469 exposure are not considered 
clinically significant. 
PK data in patients with ESRD including patients on haemo- or peritoneal dialysis are not available. 
However, based on protein binding data it is unlikely that maribavir will be significantly removed by 
dialysis and a dose adjustment is not considered necessary.

Impaired hepatic function 
Study 1263-103 
Study 1263-103 was a single-centre, open-label, parallel group, single-dose study to evaluate the PK 
of maribavir in adult patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to patients with normal 
hepatic function. A single 200 mg dose of maribavir (Tablet I) was administered under fasting 
conditions on Day 1.  
A summary of mean (SD) maribavir pharmacokinetic parameters for patients with normal hepatic 
function and patients with moderate hepatic impairment is presented in Table 13. Except for Cmax, 
statistical analysis did not reveal significant differences between the hepatic function groups. Mean 
Cmax values were 35% higher in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to patients 
with normal hepatic function. Mean Cmax,u values were 10% higher in patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment compared to patients with normal hepatic function. Based on total plasma maribavir 
concentrations, patients with moderately impaired hepatic function tended to show higher AUC values 
(about 25%) and lower clearance values (about 20%) compared to patients with normal hepatic 
function. AUC and clearance values, based on unbound maribavir plasma concentrations, for patients 
with normal hepatic function and moderately impaired hepatic function were comparable.  
Statistical analysis of VP 44469 pharmacokinetic parameters did not reveal significant differences 
between the two hepatic function groups. Compared to patients with normal hepatic function, patients 
with moderately impaired hepatic function tended to show slightly longer half-life and lower clearance 
values (i.e. higher AUC values).

Maribavir has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment.  However, it is expected 
that severe hepatic impairment might not lead to a significant increase of maribavir exposure. 
Drug-Drug-Interactions 
The Applicant has conducted several in vitro experiments to investigate the interaction potential of 
maribavir via relevant enzymes and transporters. Maribavir appeared to be in vitro inhibitor of CYP1A2, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 enzymes, as well as an inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2. In addition, 
positive inhibitory in vitro signals were observed for P-gp (IC50= 33.8 µM), BCRP (IC50= 7.05 µM), 
OAT3 (IC50= 33.3 µM) and MATE1 (IC50= 20.4 µM) transporters when compared to corresponding 
EMA DDI concentration cut-off value for the systemic exposure of maribavir (50 x Cmax,u = 45.7 µM). 
In vitro experiments have also revealed that maribavir is a susbtrate of P-gp, BCRP and OCT1 
transporters. 
UGT inhibition was shown for UGT1A1 with an IC50 of 32.3 µM, while UGT1A3, UGT1A9 and UGT1B7 
inhibition occurred at higher IC50, 184 µM, 123 µM and 153 µM, respectively. The EMA cut-off value 
was exceeded for all 4 UGT. No significant changes in the serum bilirubin concentration in the Phase 1 
Assessment report  
EMA/792160/2022

study occurred, in addition to a lack of drug-induced hyperbilirubinemia in Phase 2 and 3 studies, 
which suggested there was no clinically significant UGT1A1 inhibition with co-administration of 
maribavir. Considering the uncertainties in the intestinal expression of individual UGT enzymes as well 
as the lack of sufficiently specific probe drugs for individual UGTs, the probability of a clinically relevant 
interaction is assumed to be negligible 
BSEP inhibition by maribavir occurred with an IC50 of 46.5 µM in vitro.  
Seven clinical DDI studies were conducted to further evaluate the interaction potential of maribavir, 
i.e., the effect of other compounds on the PK of maribavir (“victim” studies) as well as the effect of 
maribavir on the PK of other compounds (“perpetrator” studies).  
Effect of other drugs on the PK of maribavir – “victim” studies 
Maribavir is primarily metabolised by CYP3A4 and hence products that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 are 
expected to affect the clearance of maribavir. In a clinical DDI study, concomitant administration with 
rifampicin (a strong inducer of CYP3A4 and moderate inducer of CYP1A2) resulted in a significant 
decrease in the systemic exposure of maribavir (AUC, Cmax and Ctrough decreased to about 40%, 60%, 
and 20% of its initial values, respectively), and increased its apparent clearance. Thus, co-
administration with strong CYP3A4 inducers may decrease the efficacy of maribavir and should be 
avoided. 
In another clinical DDI study, co-administration of maribavir with 400 mg ketoconazole (strong CYP3A4 
and P-gp inhibitor) led to an increase in maribavir AUC about 53% and Cmax about 10%. However, no 
dose adjustment is needed when maribavir is co-administered with CYP3A4 inhibitors due to lack of 
dose-limiting toxicity up to 1200 mg maribavir BID and a wide therapeutic window. For efficacy 
consideration of higher maribavir doses please refer to the efficacy section. 
The effect of CYP1A2 inducer/inhibitors on maribavir exposure was not studied in vivo although 
CYP1A2 is involved in maribavir metabolism with an estimated fm of no more than 25%. Based on the 
finding that strong CYP3A4 inhibitors did not increase the plasma exposure of maribavir to a clinically 
significant extent, the impacts from CYP1A2 inhibitors on the PK of maribavir are expected to be low 
(i.e. below the upper no effect boundary) and no dose adjustment is needed when maribavir is co-
administered with CYP1A2 inhibitors. 
Effect of maribavir on the PK of other drugs – “perpetrator” studies 
Based on the available in vivo DDI results maribavir does not change the activity of CYP1A2 (caffeine), 
CYP2C9 (S-warfarin), CYP2C19 (voriconazole), CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/dextrorphan) and CYP3A 
(midazolam), and therefore dose adjustments for the substrates of these CYP enzymes are not 
required. 
In a clinical DDI study with digoxin (P-gp substrate), maribavir caused an increase in digoxin AUC and 
Cmax by 21 and 25%, respectively. Since digoxin has a relatively high bioavailability (60-80%) and it is 
not regarded as a sufficiently sensitive probe substrate for P-gp inhibition in the intestine, these data 
are indicative of P-gp inhibition, and could be even more pronounced for P-gp substrates with lower 
oral bioavailablity. Indeed, in another clinical DDI study with tacrolimus, a CYP3A4 and P-gp substrate 
with a narrow therapeutic window, co-administration with maribavir 400 mg BID resulted in a clinically 
relevant increase in Cmax and AUC of tacrolimus by 38% and 51%, respectively. Thus, appropriate 
monitoring is recommended when using tacrolimus or other immunosuppressants (cyclosporine, 
everolimus, sirolimus) concomitantly with maribavir especially following initiation of maribavir (when 
immunosuppressant concentrations may increase) and after discontinuation of maribavir therapy 
(when immunosuppressant concentrations may decrease). In addition, clinically relevant interactions

between maribavir and other sensitive P-gp substrates cannot be excluded based on the currently 
available clinical data.

drugs – “perpetrator” studies. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
Maribavir is contraindicated with valganciclovir/ganciclovir as it may antagonise ganciclovir’s antiviral 
effects due to maribavir’s inhibitory effect on UL97 Ser/Thr kinase, which is required for 
activation/phosphorylation of ganciclovir. 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Primary pharmacology  
MBV antiviral activity is based on inhibition of the HCMV protein kinase UL97, thereby interfering with 
viral DNA replication, encapsidation, and nuclear egress. The applicant has shown that virus yield is 
reduced under MBV with viral DNA synthesis being inhibited by MBV, whereas concatamer processing 
was not affected. Formation of replication centres is blocked by MBV, while no effect on their function 
was observed. A variety of studies have shown resistance mutations mapping MBV antiviral activity to 
the ATP-binding, phosphotransfer and substrate binding domains of UL97.  
In general, MBV showed efficacy in antiviral assays with a mean EC50 of 0,1 µM against laboratory 
strain AD169 and a limited panel of 10 clinical isolates originating from different locations in the United 
States, the majority from immunocompromised patients. These assays, which were primarily based on 
DNA hybridisation using MRC-5 cells, showed that the EC50 of MBV is around 4- to 5-fold lower 
Assessment report  
EMA/792160/2022 
Page 56/57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
compared to GCV. Investigations for MBV activity included ten baseline clinical isolates with 
glycoprotein B genotypes and did not reveal an impact of these genotypes on MBV antiviral activity.  
In general, selectivity of MBV is well addressed by investigation of the antiviral effect by MBV on 
several human/animal RNA/DNA viruses (HIV, HBV, VZV, SV-40, SARS-CoV, HSV-1, RSV, vaccinia 
virus, tacaribe virus, rotavirus, LCMV and BVDV). No effect by MBV was observed at the highest 
concentration tested, showing that MBV is specific for HCMV. However, there is one exception, as 
literature data show antiviral activity of MBV against EBV (gamma herpesvirus) by affecting the viral 
DNA replication and virus transcription. No information is available on combination antiviral activity of 
MBV and HCV-antivirals.  
Adequate information has been provided on the anti-HCMV activity of MBV in combination with other 
HCMV inhibitors and sirolimus. Absolute antagonism was found for the combination of MBV with GCV 
and strong synergy for MBV combined with sirolimus. Additive effects for were seen for GW275175X, 
LTV, CDV, and FOS. The data obtained from studies in 2018 rectify earlier study results (from 1996) 
which indicated additive effect of MBV and GCV.  
The MBV anti-HCMV activity when combined with several anti-HIV agents has been analysed. No 
antagonistic effect on MBV activity was detected while there were slight additive (AZT, indinavir, 
amprenavir) and synergistic interactions (abacavir). Further, the anti-HIV activity of MBV was 
analysed, alone or in combination with anti-HIV compounds (amprenavir, indinavir, AZT, ddI, ddC, 
abacavir). MBV alone did not inhibit HIV-1 replication and in combination did not alter the anti-HIV 
activity of the respective compounds. The data support the combined use of MBV with these anti-HIV 
compounds.  
In vitro, resistance mutations in UL97 gene to MBV developed fast (passage 10) at low concentrations 
(0.3 µM MBV) and conferred a mid/high grade of resistance (12 to 80 FC). This demonstrates that MBV 
has a low genetic barrier to resistance development. During further exposure, several resistance 
mutations were found, mapping to the vicinity of the ATP-binding site, the phosphotransfer domain and 
the substrate-recognition site of UL97: L337M, F342S/Y, V356G, V353A, L397R, T409M, H411L/N/Y, 
D456N, V466G, C480R, P521L and Y617del. The FC conferred by these mutations are wide-ranging 
(3.5 to >200). Continued exposure to MBV also selected for double and triple mutations. Double 
mutants conferred high levels of resistance (FC >150).  
A diversity of singular resistance mutations emerge at UL27 under MBV treatment. Most of these 
confer only mild resistance to MBV (FC <5).. Combination of mutations in UL27 and UL97 (R233S + 
L337M or V353A) result in ~2 FC increases in MBV EC50. The effect of UL27 mutations on MBV 
antiviral activity is not quite clear but seems to be a compensatory function for loss of function 
mutations in UL97.  
Generally, MBV has been shown to be active against HCMV strains resistant to acyclovir, cidofovir, 
letermovir, and BDCRB. As regards GCV/vGCV, most common clinical GCV resistance mutations do not 
impact MBV antiviral activity. Nevertheless, various GCV resistance mutations in UL97 have been 
identified which confer high grade cross-resistance to MBV (FC of 18 to 428): K335del, F342Y, F342S, 
V356G, D456N, V466G, C480R, C480F, P521L, and Y617del. The clinical relevance of these mutations 
remains unclear, as some mutant strains showed viral growth defects.  
Secondary pharmacology 
To determine the effects of maribavir on ECG parameters (with a focus on QTc interval prolongation) a 
single-dose, randomised, Phase 1, placebo- and positive-controlled four-period cross-over study (study 
1263-108) was performed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/792160/2022

The therapeutic maribavir dose used for this study was a single 100 mg dose. This dose was selected 
because a regimen of 100 mg BID was initially evaluated for prevention of CMV disease. The 
supratherapeutic maribavir dose was a single 1200 mg dose. In order to address the maribavir dose of 
400 mg BID applied for treatment of CMV disease, the Applicant provided an addendum to the CSR of 
study 1263-108 dated August 2020. In this addendum results of an exploratory exposure-response 
(ER) statistical analysis based on study data 1263-108 are presented which assessed the potential 
relationship between maribavir and VP 44469 concentrations at maribavir doses of 100 mg and 1200 
mg and time-matched, baseline-adjusted mean differences in the QTc interval (QT interval corrected 
using Fridericia’s formula [QTcF] and QT rate-corrected individually with placebo QT-RR data [QTcIb]) 
prolongation. In addition, QTc interval prolongation was predicted for Cmax at maribavir 400 mg BID 
using the final maribavir plasma concentration-QTc model.  
The time-matched analysis of study 1263-108 demonstrated that for both the 100 mg and 1200 mg 
maribavir doses, which provided approximately twice the steady-state Cmax following 400 mg BID 
doses of maribavir in transplant patients, at all-time points the upper bound of the two-sided 90% CI 
of the difference in the means of dQTcIb from placebo (ddQTcIb) was below the 10 msec regulatory 
threshold which indicates no significant effect on cardiac repolarisation. Similar results were observed 
for QT interval corrected using Fridericia’s and Bazett’s formula. Study sensitivity was confirmed by an 
increase of ddQTcIb for moxifloxacin with a lower confidence bound exceeding 5 msec at multiple time 
points during the expected period of peak plasma concentration. Furthermore, no extreme outliers 
(i.e., QTc >480 msec or QTc change >60 msec) were observed during study 1263-108.  
Results from the linear model to evaluate the relationship between ddQTc and plasma maribavir 
concentration indicated that there was no increase in the QTc interval with increasing concentration of 
maribavir. At the estimated mean plasma maribavir Cmax of 16.5 μg/mL at the proposed therapeutic 
dose of 400 mg BID, the model-based estimates of ddQTcIb and ddQTcF were 1.1255 msec (90% CI, 
0.1612 to 2.4122 msec) and 0.9308 msec (90% CI, 0.4889 to 2.3504 msec), respectively. The upper 
bound of the 90% CI of the model-based estimates of ddQTcIb and ddQTcF for Cmax of 16.5 μg/mL at 
the proposed therapeutic dose of 400 mg BID was below the 10 msec regulatory threshold. 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of maribavir and its main metabolite VP 44469 have been well characterised in 
17 Phase I studies with 5 different oral IR formulations (capsule, Tablet I, Tablet II, Tablet III, Tablet 
IV) following administration up to 2400 mg daily. Bridging between formulations is considered essential 
to demonstrate that results of the Phase I studies are applicable to the Tablet IV formulation which 
was used in the pivotal Phase III study SHP620-303 and which has the same composition as the to-be-
marketed formulation. Bioequivalence has only be investigated between Tablet I and Tablet II. Thus, 
the applicant performed a post-hoc analysis comparing the PK parameters following  
400 mg maribavir (which corresponds to the applied dose) under fasting conditions. According to this 
analysis the geometric mean ratios for AUC0-∞ after a single dose are all close to 1 (0.98 to 1.08), 
however, the 90% CI are not in the bioequivalence range of 0.8 to 1.25.  The Cmax values were 
equivalent between Tablet III and Tablet IV; however, Tablet III and Tablet IV had 40% and 35%, 
higher Cmax, respectively, compared to Tablet II, along with slightly shorter Tmax.  
The food effect was investigated for maribavir capsule and Tablet II formulation with a dose of 400 mg 
(studies CMAB1002 and 1263-104). In both studies food decreased the systemic exposure of 
maribavir. Under high-fat and high-caloric conditions both AUC and Cmax were decreased whereas 
Assessment report  
EMA/792160/2022 
Page 58/59 
 
 
 
under medium-fat conditions, the 90% CI for AUC was still inside the bioequivalence acceptance range 
(but at the very low end).  Moreover, Ctrough seems not to be impacted by food. 
Generally, the PK parameters AUC and Cmax were comparable between healthy patients and 
transplant patients following 400 mg maribavir BID across studies. Interestingly, Ctrough seems to be 
higher in patients than in healthy patients which may be associated with a lower clearance. 
Unfortunately, serial blood samples for PK analysis were not collected in the pivotal Phase III study 
and thus PK data from Tablet IV formulation in transplant patients are not available. 
After a single oral dose of 14C-maribavir, 75% (ranging from 59% to 88%) of drug related material is 
recovered, with 61% (ranging from 52% to 70%) in urine and 14% (range 6% to 23%) in feces.  A 
mean of ~79% of the recovered radioactivity from urine and feces was identified. In conclusion only 
60% of the administered dose has been identified. Analysis of both clinical and human biomaterial data 
estimates the unknown or unidentified clearance pathway to be ~28%. Given the therapeutic window, 
allowing for a 3-fold increase in exposure, inhibition of this unknown pathway is not a clinical concern. 
Remaining is a potential concern if there could be other medical products which could induce 
metabolism of maribavir to the extent that dose adjustments are needed. There is some reassurance in 
the fact that many of the known important inducers of CYPs and UGTs also are inducers of CYP3A4 
thus already covered in the proposed SmPC-wordings. Further it is considered unlikely that the 
unknown pathway would consist of a single inducible pathway or of multiple pathways induced by the 
same substance thus leading to the need for dose adjustments upon co-administration. 
Maribavir is eliminated from the body almost exclusively by non-renal processes. Enzymes involved in 
formation of VP 44469 are CYP3A4 and to a lower extent CYP1A2. Dose adjustment for patients with 
renal impairment including ESRD patients on haemo- or peritoneal dialysis and hepatic impairment is 
not required. 
Interactions 
In vitro CYP induction experiment V7676M-SHP620 indicated more than 100% increase in mRNA levels 
for all three tested enzymes CYP1A2 (up to 3-fold), CYP2B6 (up to 23-fold) and CYP3A4 (up to 18-fold) 
relative to vehicle control. However, it is difficult to say whether the observed effect was concentration 
dependent, because the experiment included three maribavir concentrations which were not optimally 
selected, i.e., only the lowest maribavir concentration of 36 µM was close to the EMA DDI systemic 
concentration cut-off (45.7 µM), while other maribavir concentrations were well-above the clinically 
relevant exposures (144, 200 or 480 µM). Moreover, there were also signs of cell toxicity observed at 
some of these high maribavir concentrations, which makes data inconclusive. Therefore, a new in vitro 
experiment was conducted for CYP2B6 and CYP1A2 enzymes with a more appropriate selection of 
maribavir concentrations (1 -100 µM) to further investigate induction risks for these two enzymes. This 
study revealed an up to 14-fold increase in CYP1A2 mRNA while no relevant risk of CYP2B6 induction 
was concluded.  
In vitro transporter substrate experiments have indicated that maribavir is a substrate of P-gp, BCRP 
and OCT1 transporters. This information was requested to be included in the SmPC. However, it is also 
worth noting that based on the overall available data (including a relatively high upper boundary of the 
therapeutic window for maribavir) it was agreed that potential DDIs with P-gp, BCRP and/or OCT1 
inhibitors are unlikely to result in a clinically relevant interaction with maribavir. 
The Applicant has used the PBPK modelling to predict DDI scenarios with different strong/moderate 
CYP3A4 inducers, as well as to provide different dose recommendations for maribavir based on the 
PBPK analyses. These were however considered as a high regulatory impact analyses according to the 
EMA PBPK guideline, which would require a much more thorough qualification of the PBPK platform for 
Assessment report  
EMA/792160/2022 
Page 59/60 
 
 
 
 
the intended purpose, i.e., the prediction of different CYP3A4 induction scenarios. Importantly, there 
was no sufficient amount of clinically observed data provided for the different inducers to consider the 
PBPK platform qualified, and no clinical data for maribavir (apart from a rifampicin DDI study) were 
available to verify the model predictive performance with different classes of inducers (i.e., different 
levels of CYP3A4 induction). On the other hand, when considering the upper boundaries of the 
therapeutic window of maribavir (i.e. up to 3-fold increase in AUC and 2.1-fold increase in Cmax), a 
common dose adjustment apporoach with 1200 mg BID was suggested for most of the concomitantly 
administered strong/moderate CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital and 
efavirenz). Moreover, it was also agreed that for strong CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampicin (for which 
clinical DDI data are available), same dose adjustment approach might be insufficient in terms of 
Ctrough parameter, which might still be under the lower boundary of the therapeutic window (i.e. lower 
than 80% of exposure with the proposed standard therapeutic dose for maribavir). Therefore, use of 
rifampicin (as well as rifabutin and St. John’s wort) together with maribavir is not recommended. 
In a clinical DDI study (SHP620-115) conducted with digoxin as a P-gp substrate (victim drug), 
maribavir (perpetrator drug) has caused an increase in digoxin AUC and Cmax by 21% and 25%, 
respectively. Importantly, digoxin has a relatively high bioavailability (60-80%) and it is not regarded 
as a sufficiently sensitive probe substrate to investigate P-gp inhibition effects in the intestine but 
rather effects of the systemic P-gp inhibition. Therefore, the currently observed increase in digoxin 
exposure is indicative of P-gp inhibition, which could be even more pronounced for other P-gp 
substrates with lower oral bioavailability. Indeed, this might be clinically relevant as already seen in a 
clinical DDI study (1263-105) with tacrolimus as a CYP3A4/P-gp substrate, in which a clinically 
relevant increase in tacrolimus exposure was observed for AUC (1.5-fold), Cmax (1.4-fold) and Ctrough 
(1.6-fold) when co-administered with maribavir. 
Therefore, appropriate SmPC information concerning the co-administration of sensitive P-gp substrates 
with maribavir was requested and implemented. 
Besides the P-gp inhibition by maribavir, in vitro transporter inhibition experiments have also indicated 
positive DDI signals for BCRP (IC50= 7.05 µM), OAT3 (IC50= 33.3 µM) and MATE1 (IC50= 20.4 µM) 
transporters when compared to corresponding EMA DDI concentration cut-off value for the systemic 
exposure (50 x Cmax,u = 45.7 µM). Importantly, only IC50 values were estimated without corresponding 
Ki values (i.e., if competitive inhibition can be assumed as well as Ki=IC50/2, this would imply even 
higher interaction risk). No clinical DDI data are available regarding the potential inhibition of BCRP, 
OAT3 and MATE1 transporters. Therefore, appropriate SmPC restrictions/information concerning the 
concomitant use of maribavir with sensitive substrates of the above-mentioned transporters were also 
requested and implemented. 
Regarding the CYP2C19 inhibition, the Applicant has conducted a cocktail study (1263-100) in which 
parent to metabolite (omeprazole/5-hydroxyomeprazole) ratio was determined at a single time point 
(i.e., no complete PK profiles measured) 2 hours post-dose in the presence and absence of maribavir. 
These parent to metabolite ratios implied an interaction risk (1.7-fold increase). However, this study 
approach was not considered adequate and not according to the EMA DDI guideline requirements: “Full 
characterisation of the plasma concentration-time curves of the probe drug is recommended, 
estimating the effect on (oral) clearance or AUC”. In another clinical DDI study (1263-107) with 
voriconazole as a less sensitive CYP2C19 substrate (drug not listed in the current EMA DDI guideline as 
a probe substrate for CYP2C19) the Applicant has concluded no risk for CYP2C19 inhibition. Based on 
the overall available clinical data it can be concluded that maribavir can act as a weak CYP2C19 
inhibitor.

PPK modelling 
A PPK model was developed to describe the time course of maribavir concentrations in plasma in 
healthy volunteers and patients using NONMEM.  
A difference in PK between HV and transplant patients was observed: 24% lower clearance for patients 
(3.77 vs 2.85 L/h), AUC was 27% higher, and Cmin was 2.89 µg/mL in HV vs. 4.90 µg/mL in patients. 
pcVPCs revealed that these differences were only partly described through the model leading to an 
underestimation of plasma concentrations in CMV patients. 
The pcVPCs indicate slight model misspecification mainly for the first 2 hours but overall look 
reasonable. RSEs are low. For the GoF plots, where the Loess may indicate a trend there is very little 
data. The shrinkage for CL was low, but higher for other parameters such as Ka and lag-time. The 
pcVPCs stratified on study show that the model satisfactory predicts 2 of the 3 studies in CMV patient. 
For Study 202 a slight over-prediction is seen. The Phase 2 transplant patients with CMV study (Study 
203) and the Phase 3 transplant patients with CMV study (Study 303) were both adequately predicted 
by the model. Overall, the model is considered satisfactory to support the text in section 5.2 of the 
SmPC.  
The preliminary PPK model showed high unexplained variability and had no covariates included, except 
of body weight in the allometric functions on clearance and volume terms. In the final model, body 
weight was not found to be a significant predictor of maribavir PK, but it was retained in the model 
(with fixed allometric coefficients of 0.75 for CL/F and Q/F and 1 for Vc/F and Vp/F). The Applicant 
explained that the PPK model will be used to simulate the concentration-time profiles in a paediatric 
population to support future paediatric development, this is endorsed.  
Different formulations were not evaluated as a covariate, even though various formulations were used. 
This could be a reason for unexplained variability.  
The PopPK analysis is considered only supportive with regards to investigation of CYP3A4 
inhibitors/With respect to potential interactions investigated with the PPK model, the Applicant clarified 
that for strong CYP3A inducers data was mainly derived from the Phase 1 DDI study with ketoconazole 
(1263-102), whereas 65% of data regarding strong CYP3A inhibitors was derived also from the Phase 
2 and 3 studies.  
The first exploratory exposure-response analyses based on studies SHP620-202 and -203 showed a 
treatment effect but no significant effects for the predefined objectives. Only for Study 202 a 
significant negative effect of exposure on recurrence was investigated. All results derived from these 
exploratory exposure-response analyses should be interpreted with caution because maribavir 
treatment discontinuation led to low patient numbers from week 8 onwards. At Week 24 for the 400 
mg and 800 mg group only n=7 and 6 patients, respectively, were still under treatment. This is 
considered not appropriate for time to recurrence and time to undetectable viral DNA analyses until 
day 180 (25 weeks). Furthermore, the preliminary PPK model, which was used to calculate AUC0-12 Cmax 
and Cmin, is considered not robust enough as a base for exposure response modelling. The negative 
relationship between exposure parameters and probability of recurrence for Study 202 could be caused 
by methodical difficulties. However, similar results were observed in the final exposure response with a 
different data base from phase 3 (which is reported in the following under exposure-response analyses 
based on study 620-303). 
Exposure-safety (202 and 203)  
The exposure-safety analysis indicates potential increased safety concern at the exposure levels 
associated with the 1200 mg BID dosing regimen. If the conclusion that safety of the 800 and 1200 mg 
BID dose are acceptable and comparable to the 400 mg BID regimen based on the phase 2 data, is 
mainly based on clinical safety data. 
Assessment report  
EMA/792160/2022 
Page 61/62 
 
 
 
For the second exposure-response analyses based on study 620-303, logistic regression models were 
developed to link maribavir exposure to the probability of viraemia clearance and adverse events. The 
exposure metric resulting in the best fitting model according to AIC was selected to perform the 
covariate analysis. In addition to the proposed covariates in the analysis plan, presence of strong 
CYP3A inhibitors was formally evaluated as a potential risk factor to explain variability in exposure-
safety relationships but was not significant.  
Exposure-response analyses regarding efficacy revealed that of the 231 patients, a total of 131 
patients presented a confirmed CMV viraemia clearance at Study Week 8. This response was not 
maintained in all patients through Study Week 16: At this later time point, only for 44 patients 
confirmed viraemia clearance was shown. Treatment emergent CMV mutation and CD4CD69+ cell 
count at baseline were significant covariates for the probability of viraemia clearance, suggesting a 
highly significant link between mutations and resistance to maribavir in non-responders.  
Exposure-response analyses regarding safety revealed that fatigue and serious adverse events showed 
a significant positive relationship with exposure parameters, which is considered plausible. It might be 
linked with the finding that the quartile with the highest exposures has included many non-responders 
resistant to maribavir. The Covariate analysis revealed that North American patients had a higher 
probability for fatigue compared to Asian or European patients. SAE were more probable in patients 
with high CMV DNA level at baseline, which seems plausible. Furthermore, only data from study 
SHP620-303 was used for the final exposure-response modelling was used. 
The phase 2 data indicate that a higher dose than 400 BID may have been preferred. Also, regarding 
resistance, maybe a 3 times daily dosing could have been preferred over twice daily dosing. However, 
the applicant made the decision to go forward with the 400 mg BID dose in the pivotal trial. Exposure-
response analysis on the pivotal trial (one dose level) has limited value and issues regarding this 
analysis are not further pursued.  
Therapeutic index 
Note that lower doses than 400 mg BID has not been adequately evaluated and provided. If the 
efficacy MOs are solved, then the exposure from the 400 mg BID regimen should be considered the 
lower level of the therapeutic index. Any exposure reduction (i.e. due to DDIs) warrants an increased 
dose to avoid potential lack of efficacy. 
The upper level of the therapeutic index is based on the phase 2 clinical safety data for the higher 
doses studied in phase 2. Since the 400 mg BID dosing was studied in the pivotal trial, that is the main 
dose to evaluate the B/R for, however a higher exposure with regards to DDI (i.e., co-administration of 
CYP3A4 inducers and there for an increased dose maribavir) may be appropriate 
Primary Pharmacology 
The data provided on MBV antiviral activity (DNA hybridisation assay in MRC-5 cells) have been 
generated using lab strain AD169 and ten clinical isolates from the United States. As requested these 
in vitro derived EC50 values were substantiated by submission of further data. The applicant has 
provided summarised EC50 values published in literature on additional clinical isolates mainly from the 
USA. 
The determination of the antiviral activity of MBV is highly variable as the EC50 for the same HCMV 
strain can vary up to 100-fold), depending on the assay system, cell type and culture conditions used. 
Nevertheless, this has been addressed by standardizing the assay system (SEAP yield reduction assay) 
during further analysis (resistance phenotyping), but changes have been made in the cells employed 
(change from HEL to ARPEp). As stated by Chou (2020), it remains still unclear what cell culture 
system best represents the in vivo activity of MBV.    
Assessment report  
EMA/792160/2022 
Page 62/63 
 
 
 
As indicated by the applicant EC50 assays were performed in the presence of 2-4% bovine serum, 
which the applicant presumes to be adequate for binding 98% of free MBV. Upon request for further 
information the applicant commits to perform an additional study to investigate the potential effects by 
human serum albumin binding. These data are envisaged by June 2023 and should be submitted once 
available.  
Combination antiviral activity analysis of MBV with anti-HCMV compounds have been performed in 
1998. Analysis of the anti-HIV activity of MBV was performed in 1996. The choice of HIV antivirals 
seems partly outdated, as new substances and even new classes of substances have been introduced 
in the meantime.  
MBV has been demonstrated to exhibit potent anti-EBV activity in vitro (EC50 0.15 to 1.1 µM). 
The triple mutations emerging under MBV pressure have not been phenotyped and the Applicant does 
not plan to further characterise phenotypic triple mutations. The Applicant considers that each multiple 
variant will at a minimum confer maribavir resistance of the highest fold change of the RAS included in 
the multiple RAS genotype and considers that RASs which confer a 15-fold or higher increase in EC50 
are extremely difficult to clear. Following this argumentation, the Applicant was asked to include all 
identified treatment-emergent multiple RAS genotypes should be listed in section 5.1 of the SmPC to 
indicate that maribavir is no longer susceptible to the multiple RAS F342Y+T409M+H411N (78-fold), 
C480F+H411L+H411Y (224-fold), F342Y+H411Y (56-fold, as determined experimentally by Chou et 
al., 2019), T409M+C480F (224-fold) and H411Y+C480F (224-fold). 
Various cross-resistance mutations have been found for MBV and GCV. As the indication for MBV 
includes patients refractory and/or resistant to GCV/vGCV, the potential impact of these mutations on 
MBV efficacy should be taken into account. Therefore, for treatment of HCMV-infected patients pre-
treated with GCV/vGCV or CPV, screening for these resistance mutations should be performed at 
baseline. Diagnostic genotyping of UL97 should best cover the whole UL97 gene, but at least the 
relevant regions and domains correlated with resistance mutations, starting at ATP-binding region (P-
loop) residue 335 and spanning also the substrate binding domain (up to residue 707) should be 
included. 
Secondary pharmacology 
To determine the effects of maribavir on ECG parameters (with a focus on QTc interval prolongation) a 
single-dose, randomised, Phase 1, placebo- and positive-controlled four-period crossover study (study 
1263-108) was performed. The used therapeutic maribavir dose (100 mg) was selected because a 
regimen of 100 mg BID was initially evaluated for prevention of CMV disease. The supratherapeutic 
maribavir dose was a single 1200 mg dose. In order to address the maribavir dose of 400 mg BID 
applied for treatment of CMV disease, an exploratory exposure-response (ER) statistical analysis was 
investigated to assess the potential relationships between plasma concentrations of maribavir and its 
metabolite, VP 44469, and change in corrected QT (QTc) interval to evaluate the potential of maribavir 
and VP 44469 to prolong QTc interval. In addition, QTc interval prolongation was predicted for Cmax at 
maribavir 400 mg BID using the final maribavir plasma concentration-QTc model. Results 
demonstrated no clinically significant repolarisation effect of maribavir administered orally at a single 
dose of 100 mg or a supratherapeutic dose of 1200 mg, which provided approximately twice the 
steady-state Cmax following 400 mg BID doses of maribavir in transplant patients. Furthermore, no 
correlations between time-matched, baseline-adjusted QTc intervals and plasma concentrations of 
maribavir were observed. The upper bound of the 90% CI of the model-based estimates of ddQTcIb 
and ddQTcF for Cmax of 16.5 μg/mL at the proposed therapeutic dose of 400 mg BID was below the 10 
msec regulatory threshold.

2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Study results (in vitro data of CYP2B6 and CYP1A2 induction and interference assessment of maribavir 
and tacrolimus) have been submitted by the applicant. The data showed an up to 14-fold increase in 
CYP1A2 mRNA while no relevant risk of CYP2B6 induction was concluded.  
PPK modelling 
The popPK model is considered adequate for descriptive purposes (support text in section 5.2 of the 
SmPC).  
Primary pharmacology  
Generally, the data provided are generally considered adequate to demonstrate the antiviral activity of 
MBV against HCMV (EC50 ~ 0.1 µM). As requested, these data were substantiated by provision of 
additional EC50 data from literature for further clinical isolates. As regards the impact of serum binding 
on MBV activity the applicant commits to perform an additional study to investigate the potential 
effects by human serum albumin binding. For selectivity of MBV data on further Herpesviruses and HCV 
are outstanding. Information on the selectivity of MBV for other viruses and on the combination studies 
of MBV with other antivirals are partly outdated or relevant viruses/antiviral are missing. Updates are 
requested for these studies. The resistance analysis performed are generally adequate. MBV 
demonstrated a low genetic barrier of resistance development. Several resistance mutations (also in 
double/triple) have been identified in UL97. The relevance of mutations in UL27 remains unclear. 
Cross-resistances for GCV and MBV have been found, conferring very high FCs. For patients pre-
treated with GCV/vGCV, screening for these resistance mutations should be performed at baseline.  
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical development programme of maribavir consists of a single pivotal Phase 3 study (Study 
SHP620-303, Study 303) in adult transplant recipients with cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections that are 
refractory or resistant to treatment with ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, or cidofovir. In addition, 
there are two supportive phase 2 studies, Study SHP620-202 in adult transplant recipients with CMV 
infections that are refractory or resistant to treatment with ganciclovir, valganciclovir or foscarnet 
(study 202) and Study SHP620-203 in adult transplant recipients with CMV infections without CMV 
organ disease and resistance to any CMV treatment (study 203) (Table 15).

Methods 
A Phase 3, multi-centre, randomised, open-label, active-controlled study to assess the efficacy and 
safety of Maribavir (MBV) treatment compared to Investigator-assigned treatment (IAT) in transplant 
recipients with Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections that are refractory or resistant to treatment with 
ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, or cidofovir. 
To be eligible for the study, patients had to have a documented CMV infection and had to have a 
current CMV infection that was refractory to the most recently administered of the four anti-CMV 
treatment agents. 
Study-qualifying refractory CMV infections were defined as documented failure to achieve >1 log10 
(common logarithm to base 10) decrease in CMV DNA level in whole blood or plasma after a 14 day or 
longer treatment period with IV ganciclovir/oral valganciclovir, IV foscarnet, or IV cidofovir. This 
definition applied to the current CMV infection and the most recently administered anti-CMV agent.  
The definition of “refractory CMV-infection” used in study 303, differs relevantly from the currently 
accepted definition outlined in current treatment guidelines (please refer to clinical discussion for 
further details) for the intended target population.  
Assessment report  
EMA/792160/2022

Resistant CMV infection was defined as refractory CMV infection AND documentation of one or more 
CMV genetic mutations associated with resistance to ganciclovir/valganciclovir, foscarnet, and/or 
cidofovir. 
Consistent with the definitions above, all patients entering the study were refractory to treatment with 
at least 1 prior anti-CMV drug, and may, in addition, have had 1 or more resistance-associated amino 
acid substitutions (RASs) known to confer resistance to ganciclovir/valganciclovir, foscarnet, and/or 
cidofovir at baseline.  
The study included a maribavir rescue arm, which was an option for patients randomised to IAT and in 
whom despite a minimum of 3 weeks of therapy with IAT (Visit 5/Week 3) no CMV DNA decrease was 
seen. The patient had to meet stringent criteria for lack of improvement/worsening of CMV infection. 
The transition into the rescue arm was allowed after medical monitor review of the patient’s eligibility 
for the rescue arm based on protocol-defined criteria. 
Figure 4 Scheme of the study design of study 303 
Study Participants  
Study participants were male and female stem cell or solid organ transplantation recipients ≥ 12 years 
of age with documented CMV infection in whole blood or plasma, with a screening value of ≥2730 DNA 
IU/mL in whole blood • or ≥910 IU/mL in plasma in two consecutive assessments, separated by at 
least 1 day, as determined by local or central specialty laboratory qPCR or comparable quantitative 
CMV DNA results. Both samples should have been taken within 14 days prior to randomisation with 
second sample obtained within 5 days prior to randomisation. The same laboratory and same sample 
type (whole blood or plasma) must have been used for these assessments. Participants had to have a 
current CMV infection that was resistant or refractory to treatment to the most recently administered 
of the four anti-CMV treatment agents.  
Resistant CMV was defined as documentation of one or more CMV genetic mutations associated with 
resistance to ganciclovir/valganciclovir and/or foscarnet documented failure to achieve >1 log10 
(common logarithm to base 10) decrease in CMV DNA level in whole blood or plasma after a 14-day or 
longer treatment period with intravenous (IV) ganciclovir/oral valganciclovir, IV foscarnet, or IV 
cidofovir.

Refractory CMV was defined as  documented failure to achieve >1 log10 (common logarithm to base 
10) decrease in CMV DNA level in whole blood or plasma after a 14-day or longer treatment period 
with intravenous (IV) ganciclovir/oral valganciclovir, IV foscarnet, or IV cidofovir.  
Patients with current CMV infection that was considered resistant or refractory due to inadequate 
adherence to prior oral anti-CMV treatment and had tissue-invasive disease with central nervous 
system involvement, including retina (eg CMV retinitis) were excluded from the study. Patients who 
received drugs with known anti-CMV activity must have been discontinued use at least 14 days before 
the first dose of study drug. 
Treatments 
Maribavir: 
Two maribavir 200 mg tablets were orally administered at dose of 400 mg BID for 8 weeks. Maribavir 
was to be administered (preferably) every 12 hours (q12h). When q12h dosing was not feasible, the 
doses were to be separated by a minimum of 8 hours. If the timing of the first dose of maribavir on 
Visit 2/Day 0 did not allow for a minimum of 8 hours between doses, only 1 dose of maribavir was 
administered on Visit 2/Day 0.  
The maribavir batch numbers were PR160108.001, PR170101.001, PR171020.001, PR171021.001, 
PR191107.001, and PR191108.001. The formulation used in study 303 (formulation IV) is not identical 
to the formulation used in dose-ranging studies 202 and 203 (formulation III).  
Investigator assigned treatment (IAT): 
IAT dose and dosing interval was selected by the investigator for a duration of 8 weeks.  
Selection criteria for IAT: 
•  At the time of enrolment in the study, the investigator decided whether the patient should 
remain on the same anti-CMV therapy or change therapy at the time of 
randomisation/treatment initiation. 
•  One or a pre-specified combination of two of the available anti-CMV agents (GCV+FOS and 
CGV+FOS) from the following were utilised: IV ganciclovir, oral valganciclovir, IV foscarnet, or 
IV cidofovir.  
•  Dose and dose regimen of the IAT were at the discretion of the investigator following best 
clinical practice for each patient based on the specific situation. 
• 
• 
The investigators chose the IAT with knowledge of a patients’ prior clinical course for treatment 
of the current CMV infection. Although refractoriness to at least one agent was required for 
entry into the study, patients in the IAT arm were not necessarily refractory or resistant to the 
study treatment that they received as IAT under the study protocol. 
If dual anti-CMV therapy was started for a patient randomised to IAT, withdrawal of one agent 
post-randomisation, while continuing the second agent, was permitted.  
•  Changes to the selected IAT(s) at randomisation could include change in dose (increase or 
decrease) and/or dosing regimen, but could not include an addition of, or switch to, another 
anti-CMV agent not selected at randomisation. 
•  Addition of, or switch to, another anti-CMV agent was declared a failure for the purpose of 
study analysis.  
•  Changes between IV ganciclovir and oral valganciclovir were allowed. 
•  Combination therapy with cidofovir and foscarnet was prohibited.

Investigator-assigned anti-CMV treatment was not considered an investigational product in the context 
of this study. The IAT (ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet or cidofovir) was prescribed by the 
investigator and either administered at the hospital or other facility used to administer IV products as 
per local site standard practice, or was prescribed by the investigator and typically purchased by the 
study patient at the commercial pharmacy. 
Criteria for maribavir rescue treatment: 
The transition into the rescue arm was allowed after medical monitor review of the patient’s eligibility 
for the rescue arm based on meeting at least one of the following protocol-defined criteria: 
a)  Patient had increased whole blood or plasma CMV Viraemia levels of ≥1 log10 from baseline as 
measured by the local or central specialty laboratory qPCR assay (results from the same 
laboratory were to be compared). Local specialty laboratory results had to be documented. 
b)  Patient had tissue-invasive CMV disease after being on treatment for at least 3 weeks and met 
both of the following criteria:  
• 
• 
Patient’s whole blood or plasma CMV DNA had decreased <1 log10 from baseline as 
measured by the local or specialty laboratory qPCR assay (results from the same 
laboratory were to be compared). Local specialty laboratory results had to be 
documented. 
The presenting tissue-invasive CMV disease for symptomatic patients did not improve, 
or worsened as assessed by the investigator OR patient who was asymptomatic at 
baseline developed tissue-invasive CMV disease. 
2.  Patient did not achieve CMV Viraemia clearance (results from the same laboratory were 
assessed) necessitating continued anti-CMV treatment AND the patient had demonstrated 
intolerance to the IAT, as evidenced by 1 of the following conditions: 
•  Acute increase in serum creatinine, at least 50% increase from the baseline value, 
attributed to treatment (cidofovir, foscarnet) toxicity. 
•  Development of haemorrhagic cystitis when on treatment with cidofovir or foscarnet. 
• 
 Development of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] <500/mm3 
[0.5×109/L]) when on treatment with ganciclovir or valganciclovir. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of maribavir to IAT in CMV viraemia 
clearance at the end of study week 8 in transplant recipients who were refractory or resistant to prior 
anti-CMV treatment. The key secondary objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of the two 
study treatment arms on CMV viraemia clearance and tissue-invasive CMV disease and CMV syndrome 
improvement or resolution at the end of study week 8, and maintenance of this treatment effect 
through study week 16. 
The secondary objectives for patients who completed 8 weeks of study treatment were to compare the 
efficacy of maribavir to IAT on CMV viraemia clearance at the end of Week 8 in transplant recipients 
who were refractory or resistant to prior anti-CMV treatment and to compare the efficacy of the 2 
study treatment arms on CMV viraemia clearance and tissue-invasive CMV disease and CMV syndrome

improvement or resolution at the end of Week 8, and maintenance of this treatment effect through 
study weeks 12, 16, and 20.  
Several other secondary objectives were related to maintenance of CMV viraemia clearance, the 
resolution or improvement of tissue-invasive CMV disease and CMV syndrome, incidence of recurrence 
of CMV viraemia,  incidence of recurrence of CMV viraemia on and off treatment, to resistance analyses 
of  mutations in the CMV genes conferring resistance to maribavir, all-cause mortality, safety and 
tolerability of maribavir, efficacy, maintenance of the treatment effect, and the safety of maribavir 
administered as the rescue treatment and to characterise the pharmacokinetics (PK) of maribavir. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was confirmed CMV viraemia clearance at the end of Study Week 8, 
defined as plasma CMV DNA concentration <LLOQ (i.e., <137 IU/mL) per central laboratory result in 2 
consecutive postbaseline samples, separated by at least 5 days.  
The key secondars endpoint was achievement of CMV viraemia clearance and symptom control at the 
end of study week 8, followed by maintenance of this treatment effect for an additional 8 weeks off 
treatment (i.e., Follow-up week 16). Symptom control was defined as resolution or improvement of 
tissue-invasive CMV disease or CMV syndrome for patients symptomatic at baseline or no new 
symptoms of tissue-invasive CMV disease or CMV syndrome for patients asymptomatic at baseline.  
Both, the primary and key secondary endpoint were assessed regardless of whether patients 
completed the stipulated 8 weeks of study-assigned treatment. Patients who initiated alternative (non-
study) anti-CMV therapy or rescue treatment before Week 8 were counted as non-responders. 
For the following other secondary endpoints, subject who initiated alternative (non study) anti-CMV 
therapy before the time point of interest were counted as non-responders: the maintenance of the 
CMV viraemia clearance and CMV infection symptom control achieved at the end of Study Week 8 
through Weeks 12 and 20, achievement of confirmed CMV viraemia clearance after 8 weeks of 
receiving study-assigned treatment, achievement of confirmed CMV viraemia clearance and CMV 
infection symptom control after 8 weeks of receiving study-assigned treatment. 
Recurrence of CMV viraemia was an additional secondary endpoint and was defined as plasma CMV 
DNA concentrations ≥LLOQ, when assessed by central specialty laboratory, in 2 consecutive plasma 
samples separated by at least 5 days after achieving confirmed viraemia clearance. The following 
recurrence endpoints were assessed using all CMV DNA measurements after achieving confirmed CMV 
viraemia clearance regardless of rescue or alternative treatment: Recurrence of CMV viraemia by study 
period, recurrence of CMV viraemia on treatment and off treatment, recurrence by the laboratory 
definition (ie, based only on CMV DNA), particularly before week 8, may not be clinically meaningful 
due to usual viral load fluctuations. Therefore, recurrence was evaluated in patients with CMV viraemia 
clearance at Week 8 (i.e., who fulfilled the requirement for the primary efficacy endpoint) and who 
received alternative treatment after week 8.  
All-cause mortality was analysed regardless of the use of rescue treatment or alternative anti-CMV 
treatment. The time to all-cause mortality by the end of study participation in days was calculated as 
stop date (event date of death due to any cause or censored at date of last contact) minus 
randomisation date plus 1. The analysis was repeated for all-cause mortality on study after receiving 
study-assigned treatments but censoring at time of alternative anti-CMV treatment or maribavir rescue 
therapy. 
Patients who received maribavir as rescue therapy were evaluated for CMV viraemia clearance at week 
8 of the rescue phase.

The maribavir resistance profile was evaluated using genotyping data from baseline and postbaseline 
CMV DNA samples. Results of this analysis are presented in a separate Resistance Report. 
Definitions: 
The baseline value for efficacy was based on the results from central laboratory, for tissue invasive 
disease symptoms evaluation, the adjudicated results by EAC were used for efficacy analysis. 
The baseline value for efficacy variables is defined as the last available value before or on the first dose 
of study drug on Visit 2/Day 0. The strata based on the central laboratory baseline plasma CMV DNA 
concentrations for the efficacy analysis are defined as: 
• 
• 
• 
high viral load with CMV DNA ≥91000 IU/mL 
intermediate viral load ≥9100 and <91000 IU/mL, 
low viral load CMV DNA <9100 IU/mL 
Confirmed CMV viraemia clearance:  
defined as plasma CMV DNA concentration below the lower limit of quantification (<LLOQ; ie, <137 
IU/mL) when assessed by COBAS® AmpliPrep/COBAS® TaqMan® CMV Test at a central specialty 
laboratory, in 2 consecutive post-baseline samples, separated by at least 5 days. 
Recurrence of CMV viraemia:  
defined as plasma CMV DNA concentration ≥LLOQ when assessed by COBAS® AmpliPrep/COBAS® 
TaqMan® CMV Test in 2 consecutive plasma samples at least 5 days apart, after achieving confirmed 
viraemia clearance.  
Recurrence of symptomatic CMV infection:  
defined as the presence of signs or symptoms of the tissue invasive CMV disease or CMV syndrome 
(same or new symptomatology) confirmed as per Ljungman et al. (2017), after the period of resolution 
of the symptomatic infection in patients symptomatic at baseline. 
Importantly, the primary and secondary objectives/endpoints and the respective analyses were 
changed with protocol amendment 3, 17 months after the start of the study to include patients who 
had discontinued study treatment early and met the criteria of confirmed CMV viraemia clearance at 
study week 8 as responders in the primary efficacy analysis.

Post amendment 3 
Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
All eligible patients were first stratified based on two factors: 
1. 
2. 
By transplant type (HSCT or SOT) 
By the most recent screening whole blood or plasma CMV DNA viral load categorised into 3 
CMV DNA concentration-level groups based on local or central specialty laboratory qPCR results, as 
described above. 
Following stratification, patients were randomised in a 2:1 allocation ratio to receive open-label 
maribavir 400 mg BID or IAT for 8 weeks using interactive response technology (IRT). Within the IAT 
group, the investigator selected the actual study treatment. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint compared the proportion of responder in maribavir treatment 
group who achieve confirmed viraemia clearance at end of study week 8, with proportion of responder 
in IAT group who achieve confirmed viraemia clearance at end of study week 8 using a composite 
estimand strategy counting patients switching to an alternative treatment, to the maribavir rescue 
treatment and missing CMV measurement at week 8 as non-responder in the primary analysis 
supplemented by several sensitivity analyses. 
The difference in proportion of responders between treatment groups will be obtained using Cochran-
Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) weighted average across all strata, and tested using CMH method, with 
transplant type and baseline plasma CMV DNA concentration as two stratification factors. The 95% 
confidence limits of the weighted average of difference across strata will be provided using the normal 
approximation. If the minimum number of patients in a response category in a treatment group, for 
example, in the high viral load group, is less than 5, the high and intermediate viral load groups will be 
collapsed into 1 stratum level. 
Assessment report  
EMA/792160/2022 
Page 72/73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The proportion of responders for the key secondary endpoint were compared in a similar way. The 
difference in proportion of responders between treatment groups will be obtained and tested using the 
same method as described for the primary efficacy endpoint. The EAC’s adjudicated tissue-invasive 
disease or CMV syndrome symptoms and outcome will be used for the analysis. 
The hypothesis-testing of the primary and key secondary endpoint will be adjusted for multiple 
comparisons using a fixed-sequence testing procedure to control the family-wise Type 1 error rate at 
5% level. 
If the proportion of responders for the primary efficacy endpoint is higher in the maribavir group and 
the test of adjusted difference in proportion of responders between treatment groups is statistically 
significant, and the proportion of response for the key secondary efficacy endpoint is higher in 
maribavir group and the test is significant at 0.05 level, it will be concluded that the treatment effect is 
more durable for maribavir as compared to the control group. 
The analysis of the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoint were conducted using the Randomised 
Set as primary. 
The primary version of the SAP was finalised on 30 May 2018, i.e. more than 17 months after the first 
patient was enrolled. Three amendments were generated after that date.  
According to the Applicant, the SAP was finalised late on 30 May 2018 but prior to database lock (14 
November 2020).  
Estimand definition and missing data handling were specified for a composite estimand strategy 
regarding the intercurrent events “switch to MBV rescue”, “alternative anti-CMV treatment”, “study 
discontinuation” and “missing CMV measurement but remained in the study”. However, this strategy is 
prone to bias in favour of maribavir due to the open-label nature of the study. Instead, a treatment 
policy estimand strategy should be pursued for the first two intercurrent events. It is noted that CMV 
DNA measurements at week 8 were available in most cases after treatment switch and can be used. 
The use of the CMV viraemia clearance at the time of discontinuation in one of the sensitivity analyses 
refers to a LOCF analysis which may not be fully adequate (although acceptable as a sensitivity 
analysis) since recurrence had occurred in a number of patients.  
Because this study was the only pivotal study, the treatment allocation unbalanced between regions 
and the potentially different medical care in the different countries, homogeneity between subgroups 
and countries or regions would be important to show. Even if the randomisation was not stratified by 
centre or country, homogeneity between countries and regions has to be justified. However, relevant 
differences in treatment assignments and treatment response between countries have been observed 
and questions the fulfilment of the requirements of the EMA Points to Consider on Application with 1. 
Meta-analyses; 2. One pivotal study. 
Results 
•  Participant flow 
As per protocol, the randomised set was the primary analysis set. 
A total of 415 patients were screened for the study and 352 patients were enrolled and randomised 
(randomised set), with 235 patients randomised to maribavir and 117 patients randomised to IAT.  
The main reasons for ineligibility in the screened but not randomised population were failure to 
demonstrate confirmed minimum CMV viral load (Inclusion Criterion 3; N=31) and failure to 
demonstrate that current CMV infection was refractory to the most recent CMV treatment (Inclusion 
Assessment report  
EMA/792160/2022 
Page 73/74 
 
 
 
 
Criterion 4A, N=21). The requirement for central laboratory testing  CMV DNA viral load ≥ 910 IU/mL 
was not mandatory for the screening visit and local laboratory testing results could be used to 
determine eligibility for study randomisation. Divergent results from the central and local laboratory 
have resulted in the randomisation of many of ineligible patients. 
Two randomised patients (one in each treatment group) were not dosed; therefore, the modified 
randomised set and the safety set included 350 patients (maribavir: 234; IAT: 116). Most patients in 
the control group received monotherapy with either ganciclovir/valganciclovir (48.3%) or foscarnet 
(40.5%) as the IAT.  
Differential drop out was observed in the IAT arm. Only half of the patients in the IAT group, who did 
not switch to the rescue arm, completed the study (49%) compared to 85% patients in the maribavir 
arm. Overall, 220 (62.5%) randomised patients completed 8 weeks of study-assigned treatment, 78% 
in the maribavir group and 32% in the IAT group. Treatment discontinuation due to AEs, was nearly 5-
fold higher for the IAT group than for maribavir-treated patients (30.8% vs 6.4%, respectively). 
Treatment discontinuation for lack of efficacy (IAT: 13.7%; maribavir: 8.9%) and other reasons for 
discontinuation (IAT: 13.7%; maribavir: 1.7%) were also more frequent in the IAT group. Death led to 
treatment discontinuation for 3.0% of maribavir-treated patients compared with 0.9% for IAT.

All percentages are based on the number of randomized patients. 
a One patient discontinued rescue treatment and the study due to sponsor decision. One patient discontinued the study due to hospitalization in a 
different city (unable to complete follow-up visits). 
b Other reasons for study discontinuation included PI discretion to discontinue 1 patient before dosing with maribavir and no efficacy with IAT for 
a patient who was not eligible for rescue therapy. 
c Other reasons for treatment discontinuation in the IAT group fell into the general categories of low viral load/CMV clearance (with concern of 
toxicity with continued administration of IAT) (9 patients), patient safety (3 patients), patient/PI request (2 patients), no efficacy and patient 
ineligible for rescue therapy (1 patient), and peripherally inserted central catheter issues (1 patient). 
d Other reasons for treatment discontinuation in the maribavir group included PI decision to switch to letermovir (1 patient), CMV detected in 
patient’s cerebrospinal fluid (1 patient), nothing-by-mouth status with mental status change with risk for aspiration (1 patient), and disease 
progression (1 patient). 
Source:  Study 303 CSR, Table 14.1.1.1 and Section 16.2, Appendix 16.2.1, Listing 16.2.1.2 
A total of 22 patients (19%) met the criteria for entry into the maribavir rescue arm. Reasons for 
inclusion in the rescue set were failure to achieve CMV viraemia clearance necessitating continued anti-
CMV treatment and intolerance to the IAT (N=15), more than ≥1 log10 increase from baseline in CMV 
DNA (N=4) less or failure to achieve at least <one log10 decrease from baseline in CMV DNA and 
persistent or new symptomatic CMV infection (N=3). The rescue set included patients who switched 
from all four of the protocol-defined IAT types: foscarnet (36.4%), ganciclovir (27.3%), valganciclovir 
(18.2%), and cidofovir (18.2%). 
•  Conduct of the study 
The study protocol was amended 6 times during the conduct of study 303, including substantial 
changes in the primary and key secondary objectives, endpoints and analyses more than 17 months 
after study start to include patients who had discontinued study treatment early and met the criteria of 
confirmed CMV viraemia clearance at study week 8 as responders in the primary efficacy analysis and 
the change of definition of symptomatic CMV infection to include both tissue-invasive CMV disease and 
CMV syndrome.  
A high number of protocol deviations/GCP deviation was noted in study 303. In total, 341 patients 
(97%) had at least one protocol deviation/GCP deviation during the conduct of study 303. Protocol 
deviation/GCP deviations classified as major were reported for 229 (65.1%) patients (MBV: 66.0% and 
IAT: 63.2%, respectively). A high number of GCP deviations, related to investigator related issues 
(qualifications/agreements, record keeping source docs, safety reporting (CRF), safety reporting 
(regulatory/sponsor) and patient medical care) was reported. 
An “eDiary malfunction” was mentioned in the CSR of study 303 that seems to have affected PK 
related data (please refer to the pharmacokinetic section above). The impact of concentrations 
associated with missed dosing records in Study 620-303 was evaluated during development of PPK 
model. Missed dosing records were related to 14% of the concentrations in this study and were 
imputed from the PPK model. No substantial influence of the missing data was seen.  
A high number of missing endpoint assessment were noted (11% in the IAT group and 9% in the 
maribavir group). Upon request, further information on the missing endpoint assessment were 
provided. 
•  Baseline data 
Patient demographic characteristics were similar between the maribavir and IAT groups for race, 
ethnicity, height, weight, and BMI. The study population was predominantly white (75.6%) and not 
Hispanic or Latino (83.2%). The median age was similar between the maribavir and IAT groups (57 
years [range: 19 to 79] and 54 [range: 19 to 77] years, respectively). The maribavir group had a 
higher proportion of patients ≥65 years of age compared with IAT (23.0% and 13.7%, respectively), 
Assessment report  
EMA/792160/2022 
Page 75/76 
 
 
 
 
as well as a higher proportion of male patients (63.0% and 55.6%, respectively). 
Although adolescent patients ≥12 years of age were permitted to enrol according to the protocol, no 
patients <18 years of age enrolled in the study. As no indication for adolescents is sought in this MAA, 
this is acceptable. 
Sites in North America accounted for more than half of the randomised patients (58.2%), with a 
similar percentage of patients allocated to each treatment group. Sites in Europe randomised 38.6% of 
patients overall (maribavir: 41.3%; IAT: 33.3%) with some imbalances concerning the treatment 
allocation.   
In total, 60% of the patient had a SOT, while slightly less patients had a HSC transplant (40%). 
Transplant type was used as stratification factor, hence the distribution of the two transplant types was 
similar across treatment arms. Among SOT recipients, the most common current transplant type was 
kidney (50.2%), followed by lung transplant (29.4%), and heart transplant (10.9%). 
A higher percentage of maribavir-treated patients underwent a myeloablative preparative conditioning 
regimen prior to HSCT compared with patients in the IAT group (maribavir: 47 [51.5%] patients; IAT: 
16 [33.3%] patients). The majority of the HSCTs performed were allogeneic. 
The proportion of maribavir-treated patients with moderate renal impairment at baseline was higher 
than in the IAT group (26% vs 18%, respectively).

(randomised set).

Current CMV infection 
The majority of patients meeting virologic inclusion criteria, as determined by the central laboratory, 
fell into the category of low CMV DNA viral load (<9100 IU/mL) (>65%), while only 6% had viral load 
categorised as high (≥91000 IU/mL) and most did not have EAC-confirmed CMV tissue-invasive disease 
or CMV syndrome at baseline. 
Although baseline CMV DNA was used as stratification factor, imbalance in the distribution of viral load 
categories based on central lab results were noted. This imbalance is based on the use of local instead 
of central laboratory assays results for randomisation. 
Only 29 patients had EAC confirmed symptomatic CMV infection. Imbalances concerning the 
distribution of patients with EAC confirmed symptomatic infection across treatment arms (IAT: 8 
patients (6.8%); maribavir: 21 (8.9 %)) were noted.

Genotyping of baseline plasma samples by the central laboratory for the presence of at least one CMV 
RAS known to confer resistance to ganciclovir, foscarnet, and/or cidofovir is shown in Table 18. 
Patients with CMV harbouring RAS known to confer resistance to ganciclovir, foscarnet, and/or 
cidofovir constituted the primary resistance set (PRS). The 130 patients with genotyping data and for 
whom no baseline IAT RASs were identified constituted the non-primary resistance set (non-PRS). 
More than half of the patients (54%) harboured virus with at least one resistance-associated amino 
acid substitution (RAS) known to confer resistance to one or more of the following: ganciclovir, 
foscarnet, and/or cidofovir. Baseline Imbalances between the treatment arms were noted, with more 
patients in the IAT group having CMV harbouring RAS conferring resistance to at least one IAT (59%) 
compared to maribavir (52%). 
Four patients, who had not been previously exposed to maribavir had baseline RAS known to confer 
resistance to maribavir. 
Table 18 Baseline Resistance Profile study 303 (Modified Randomised Set) 
More than half of the patients (57%) identified as having one or more baseline RASs known to confer 
resistance to ganciclovir/valganciclovir received ganciclovir/valganciclovir as the IAT (Table 19). Hence, 
they received a treatment their virus were already resistant to at baseline. Not all patients resistant to 
ganciclovir/valganciclovir were treated according to the “management algorithm for patients with 
suspected resistant CMV infection” recommended in current CMV treatment guidelines. Also, there was 
no requirement for documentation of host factors and the clinical rational for changing the treatment. 
This is a clear limitation of the study as it may have negatively impacted the failure rate in the IAT arm 
and hampers the assessment of treatment response in the target population, as well as factors that 
might have an impact on the treatment response.

•  Numbers analysed 
The randomised set was used for primary efficacy analyses and included 117 patients in the IAT group 
and 235 patients in the maribavir group. The randomised set was supported by the modified 
randomised set that excluded two patients, one in each treatment group, who were randomised but 
not treated. 
The PP set excluded 21 patients with major protocol deviations, i.e. patients who discontinued 
treatment early (i.e. 72 hours; MBV group (N=2), IAT group (N =1)), who received prohibited 
concomitant medications (MBV group (N=5), IAT group (N =5)) and without violation of inclusion 
and/or exclusion criteria (MBV group (N=6), IAT group (N =4)). As no adolescent patients were 
enrolled in study 303, no adolescent PK set is available. 
•  Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint:  
The proportion of patients achieving confirmed CMV viraemia clearance at the end of Week 8 in 
transplant recipients with refractory CMV infection (with or without resistance) is shown in Table 20 
below. Patients with confirmed CMV viraemia clearance at the end of Week 8 were considered as 
responders regardless of whether the study-assigned treatment was discontinued before the end of the 
stipulated 8 weeks of therapy. 
The proportion of maribavir-treated subjects who achieved confirmed CMV viraemia clearance at Week 
8 was higher in the maribavir goup compared to the IAT group in the randomised set (maribavir: 56%; 
IAT: 24%). After adjusting for the stratification factors (transplant type of SOT vs HSCT and baseline 
plasma CMV DNA viral load group of low vs pooled intermediate/high), using the CMH test, the 
difference in proportion of responders between treatment groups was highly statistically significant in 
favour of maribavir (32.8%; 95% CI: 22.80, 42.74, p<0.001).

Categorisation of the reasons for failure for the 104 (44.3%) patients in the maribavir group and 89 
(76.1%) patients in the IAT group who failed to achieve the primary endpoint at the end of week 8 is 
shown in Table 21. 
Table 21 Reasons for failure of achieving primary endpoint at study week 8 by treatment group 
(Randomised Set) 
The median time to failure to achieve the primary endpoint at week 8 was evaluated for patients who 
failed due to early discontinuation or initiation of alternative anti-CMV treatment or maribavir rescue 
treatment. In this analysis, the median time to failure was longer for patients in the maribavir group 
(35 days [range: 2 to 57 days]) than for patients in the IAT group (26 days [range: 2 to 59 days]).

All-cause mortality 
No effect of maribavir was seen on all-cause mortality. A similar percentage of patients in each 
treatment group died during the study (maribavir: 27 [11.5%] patients; IAT: 13 [11.1%] patients). 
Median time to death was shorter in the maribavir compared to the IAT group. 
Maintenance of CMV Viraemia clearance and CMV infection symptom control achieved at the 
end of week 8 through Weeks 12 and 20 
Patients who achieved confirmed CMV viraemia clearance and CMV infection symptom control at Week 
8, and maintained the response through the designated time point (ie, Week 12 or Week 20), were 
classified as responders for the respective time point. Results of the analysis are shown below.

Efficacy outcomes maribavir rescue set 
Twenty-two patients entered the maribavir rescue arm after medical monitor review based on the 
protocol-defined criteria.  
Confirmed viraemia clearance at week 8 
Of the 22 patients who received maribavir as rescue therapy, 11 (50.0%) patients achieved confirmed 
CMV viraemia clearance at Week 8 of the maribavir rescue treatment phase and 11 (50.0%) patients 
were non-responders. 
At week 12, eight of the 22 patients achieved confirmed viraemia clearance and CMV infection 
symptom control in the maribavir rescue arm. Response was maintained in six patients at week 16 and 
five patients at week 20. 
Exploratory endpoints 
CMV viral load over time 
No difference in mean (SD) change from baseline in log10 plasma CMV DNA viral load was seen 
between the maribavir and IAT group at Week 8 (-1.30 (0.994) vs. -1.32 (1.152), respectively) and 
week 16 (-1.49 (0.912) vs. -1.39 (1.071), respectively). 
Time to viraemia clearance 
Overall, 184 (78.3%) patients in the maribavir group and 65 (55.6%) patients in the IAT group 
achieved confirmed CMV viraemia clearance at any time during the study. The observed median time 
to first CMV Viraemia clearance (i.e., time to first of two consecutive CMV DNA values <LLOQ) was 
17.0 days (range: 5.0 to 114.0 days) in the maribavir group and 20.0 days (range: 6.0 to 111.0 days) 
in the IAT group. The median (95% CI) time to first confirmed CMV viraemia clearance based on the 
Kaplan-Meier estimates was shorter for maribavir-treated patients than for patients in the IAT group 
(maribavir: 22.0 [21.0, 23.0] days; IAT: 29.0 [22.0, 35.0] days, p=0.030).

Time from first CMV viraemia clearance to viraemia recurrence 
Overall, 104/184 (56.5%) patients in the maribavir group and 22/65 (33.8%) patients in the IAT group 
had CMV Viraemia recurrence at any time during the study. The observed median time from first CMV 
viraemia clearance to CMV viraemia recurrence was 42.0 days (range: 14.0 to 123.0 days) in the 
maribavir group and 45.5 days (range: 16.0 to 89.0 days) in the IAT group.  
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup Analyses of the Primary Endpoint 
Subgroup analyses for the primary endpoint were conducted for the individual IAT, across transplant 
type (SOT and HSCT), baseline CMV DNA viral load, patients with EAC confirmed symptomatic CMV 
infection (i.e., CMV syndrome/disease), patients with genotypic resistance to other anti-CMV agents, 
and patients with antilymphocyte use.  
No significant effect of maribavir treatment compared to IAT was seen in patients without baseline 
resistance to IAT (13%, CI: -6.24, 31.43, p=0.19), while a significant effect in patients with baseline 
resistance to IAT (44% CI: 31.33, 56.94, p <0.001) was seen. Response rates in the maribavir arm 
only, were also higher among patients in the maribavir arm with baseline resistance to IAT (63%, 
CI:54.20, 71.42) compared to patients without resistance (44%, CI: 33.83, 53.67).  
In total 29 patients had EAC confirmed symptomatic disease was considerably small (N=29). A 
numerically trend for a better response in patients with EAC confirmed CMV syndrome/disease at 
baseline achieved CMV viraemia clearance week 8 in the maribavir group (10/21 (47.6%)) compared 
to the IAT group (1/8 (12.5%).

Table 36 Subgroup analyses of confirmed CMV viraemia clearance response at study week 8 by 
treatment group (randomised set) 
Subgroup analyses for the key secondary endpoint were provided. The small number of responders for 
the key secondary endpoint in each treatment group preclude any conclusions based on subgroup 
analyses.  
Clinical virology  
Genotypic sequencing was performed for all study patient samples with CMV DNA viral load at or above 
the predefined cut-off level of 500 copies/mL (455 IU/mL) at protocol defined time points at baseline, 
during the treatment phase, during the study follow-up phase, and at the end of the study. 
Central laboratory CMV DNA quantification in the SHP620-303 study was performed using the 
COBAS®AmpliPrep/ COBAS®TaqMan® CMV test, which is is an FDA-approved in vitro nucleic acid 
amplification test for the quantitative measurement of CMV DNA in human EDTA plasma and which is 
calibrated to the World Health Organization International Standard for Human CMV for Nucleic Acid 
Amplification Techniques. Samples ≤ 137 IU/ml were defined as undetectable CMV DNA. 
The primary resistance set (PRS) is defined as all patients with at least one known resistance-
associated amino acid substitution (RAS) to IAT in pUL97 and/or pUL54 identified at baseline. Patients 
without identified baseline IAT RASs are designated non-PRS.

The maribavir resistance set (MRS) is defined as all patients with at least one known RAS to maribavir 
in pUL97 and/or pUL27 at baseline. Patients without identified baseline maribavir RASs are designated 
non-MRS. 
The disposition of patients in the modified randomised set in both treatment arms with and without 
genotyping data for IAT and maribavir is summarised in the table below. 
Table 37 Summary of baseline genotyping testing and resistance to investigator-assigned anti-CMV 
treatment and maribavir (modified randomised set) 
A summary of baseline genotyping results by anti-CMV drug and IAT type selected for the modified 
randomised set is shown below. 
Table 38 Summary of baseline genotyping results by anti-CMV Drug and IAT type selected (modified 
randomised set) 
Most patients had CMV encoding IAT RAS at baseline. More patients in the IAT group had virus 
encoding for baseline IAT RAS in pUL97 (75% vs. 72%), IAT RAS to pUL54 (6% vs. 7%) and in both 
pUL97 and pUL54 (19% vs. 22%) compared to patients in the maribavir arm.  
The most common single baseline IAT RASs identified in pUL97 in the IAT group were A594V (N=11), 
L595S (N=9), C603W (N=7), F342Y (N=3), M460I (N=2), M460V (N=1), A594S (N=2), H520Q (N=1), 
and L595F (N=1). Most of this RAS are known to confer a high-level of resistance to 
ganciclovir/valganciclovir. The F342Y RAS has been reported to cause increases in EC50 for both GCV 
(6.0-fold) and maribavir (4.5-fold). 
The most common single baseline IAT RASs detected in pUL97 in the maribavir group were L595S 
(N=20), A594V (N=14), C603W (N=6), M460I (N=6), M460V (N=4), C592G (N=4), A594P (N=3), 
A594T (N=3), H520Q (N=4), and L595F (N=3). Most of this RAS are known to confer a high level of 
resistance to ganciclovir/valganciclovir.

Treatment response in patients with baseline resistance to IAT 
A greater proportion of maribavir-treated patients in the PRS had confirmed viraemia clearance at 
Week 8 compared to IAT (63% vs 20%, respectively). No significant effect treatment difference was 
seen in the non-PRS set (32% vs. 44%).  
Table 39 Patients achieving confirmed clearance of plasma CMV DNA at the end of study week 8 by 
analysis group and primary resistance set classification (modified randomised set) 
Most IAT RAS were located in the pUL97 region, while only a few did have pUL54. No difference in 
proportion of responders in the maribavir group were seen in the analysis by gene location.  
Table 40 PRS patients achieving confirmed clearance of plasma CMV DNA at the end of study week 8 
by analysis group and gene location of mutation(s) 
Postbaseline Treatment-emergent Resistance to IAT 
Post-baseline treatment emergent RAS to IAT was more frequently observed in the maribavir group 
(13%) compared to the IAT group (5%). This effect was consistent for RAS in the pUL97 region 
(maribavir: 9% and IAT: 3%).

In the maribavir group the following treatment-emergent single treatment emergent IAT RAS were 
identified; C480F (N=12) and F342Y (N=3). Both are known to confer high-level resistance to 
maribavir but also confer resistance to ganciclovir/valganciclovir. Single IAT RAS associated with 
significant increases in EC50 to GCV, were also detected in pUL97 A595V, C603F, C595S (each one 
patient).  
IAT RAS in pUL54 were detected more frequently in the maribavir group (N=8) compared to the IAT 
group (N=1). All detected treatment-emergent RAS in pUL54 confer cross resistance to either 
foscarnet (S290R, V715M), foscarnet and ganciclovir (N408D, T503I, K513N and A789G) or to all of 
them (L773V).  
Baseline resistance to maribavir 
Baseline resistance to maribavir was rare and only detected in four patients (IAT: N=3, MBV: N=1). 
With the exception of one pUL27 RAS (L139R) in the maribavir group, all other mutations were 
detected in the pUL97 region. pUL97 F342F maribavir RAS was the only RAS detected in the IAT group, 
which was also detected at baseline in one patient in the maribavir rescue arm.   
Treatment response among patients with baseline resistance to maribavir 
None of the patients in the MRS did respond to treatment. The three patients in the IAT arm with 
baseline RAS pUL97 F342Y RAS known to confer high-level of resistance to maribavir, did not respond 
to IAT treatment. No response was seen in the one patient in maribavir group who had CMV with 
baseline pUL27 L193F maribavir RAS. The clinical relevance of pUL27 L193F remains unclear. 
Postbaseline treatment-emergent resistance to maribavir 
Post-baseline treatment emergent RAS to maribavir were only observed in the maribavir group (21%). 
Treatment emergent mutations were detected in 60/214 (29%) of the patients treated with maribavir 
with available genotypic data. In 45/214 patients (21%) RAS to maribavir developed during the first 8 
weeks of treatment, while in 17/214 (8%) patients RAS to maribavir developed after treatment 
cessation. All treatment-emergent RAS to maribavir were identified in pUL97. 
The most frequently detected post-bassline RAS to maribavir on treatment were T409M (N=13), C480F 
(N=9), H411Y (N=5), H411N and F342Y (each N=1). All of these RAS are also known to confer 
resistance to ganciclovir. Several multiple RAS to maribvir were detected, the most common were 
T490M+C480F (N=5) and T409M+H411Y (N=7). The impact on maribavir and 
ganciclovir/valganciclovir EC50s of these multiple RAS is missing. Upon request, it was confirmed that 
there is no plan to further investigate phenotypic resistance, as it is considered that each multiple RAS 
genotype. Accordingly, this information was included in section 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC to indicate 
that maribavir is no longer susceptible to CMV with this multiple RAS and treatment should be 
discontinued.  
Off treatment, the most frequently detected maribavir RAS was H411Y (N=10), followed by C480F 
(N=4) and T409M (N=3).  
Postbaseline treatment-emergent resistance to maribavir rescue arm 
Treatment emergent maribavir RAS were detected in CMV of four out of seven patients (24%) in the 
maribavir rescue arm. All treatment-emergent mutations were detected in pUL97 (H411N (N=1) and 
T409M (N=2). One patient had virus encoding for a triple-RAS (T409M+H411L+H411Y).

Treatment response among patients developing maribavir RASs 
Of the 42 patients in the maribavir-randomised analysis group who developed post-baseline maribavir 
RASs, 41/42 patients (97.6%) did not achieve the primary endpoint, while 1/42 patients (2.4%) did. 
Of these 42 patients, 18/42 patients (43%) were virologic non-responders (did not achieve viraemia 
clearance at any time point during the study) and 24/42 patients (57.1%) were virologic responders. 
Of these 24 virologic responders, 21/24 patients (87.5%) had recurrence on or off treatment.

Notes 
Reasons for drop-out: 
• 
• 
• 
The main reasons for discontinuation of the treatment in IAT arm 
were: adverse events (30.8%) and lack of efficacy (13.7%)  
The main reasons for discontinuation of the treatment in the 
maribavir arm were adverse events (6.4%) and lack of efficacy 
(8.9%) 
The completion rate was twice as high in the maribavir group 
(77.9%) compared to the IAT group (31.6%) 
•  19% (22 patients) qualified for inclusion to the maribavir rescue arm. 
Critical findings: 
• 
The primary endpoint was changed late during the open label study 
and could have been done in knowledge of data. In the sensitivity 
analysis of the initial primary endpoint no statistically significant 
effect was observed. 
Last SAP amendment was finalised after last subject completed  
• 
•  Differential drop-out rates in the IAT group compared to the 
maribavir group.  
•  Response rate in IAT arm lower than observed in clinical practice. 
The response rate in the IAT arm could have been influenced by the 
high rate of patients being resistant to their assigned IAT. 
•  No statistically significant effect of maribavir in patients without 
resistance was seen. 
•  A lack of consistency with the overall treatment effect in study 303 
was seen between the subgroups of maribavir treated patients who 
are refractory and those who are resistant to IAT, which is 
contradictory to the study results of study 202. 
•  Baseline imbalances between the treatment group concerning the 
proportion of patient with and without resistance and baseline viral 
load category 
•  Definition of refractory CMV used for study enrolment does not 
comply with definitions of treatment guidelines.

Overall 70 patients >65 years of age were treated with maribavir in the Phase 3 study SHP-620-303. 
Since no further differentiation was presented, the applicant was requested to provide this data. Renal 
and hepatic impairment studies were conducted (please refer to section “pharmacokinetics”).

2.6.5.5.  Supportive studies 
SHP-620-202 
This was a Phase 2, multi-centre, randomised, dose-ranging, parallel-group study of maribavir for the 
treatment of CMV infections that were resistant or refractory to treatment with 
ganciclovir/valganciclovir or foscarnet in SCT or SOT recipients. The study was conducted at 27 sites in 
the US. 
Approximately 120 patients were planned to be randomised in a 1:1:1 allocation ratio to receive oral 
maribavir at one of 3 dose strengths (400 mg BID, 800 mg BID, or 1200 mg BID) for up to 24 weeks. 
Randomisation of eligible patients was stratified by transplant type (SCT or SOT). All patients received 
maribavir, but patients, investigators, and study staff were blinded to dose strength. During the study, 
patients were followed as either inpatients or outpatients, depending on their condition. An overview of 
the study design is provided in Figure 6. 
All patients must have achieved at least a minimum virologic response at Weeks 3 and 6 for study drug 
treatment to continue beyond each of these time points. For patients who continued dosing after the 
Week 6 visit, dosing could continue at the discretion of the investigator through a maximum of 24 
weeks in an attempt to decrease CMV DNA to undetectable, and/or to maintain undetectable CMV DNA 
in an effort to prevent recurrence of CMV infection. These patients underwent study-specific 
evaluations every 2 weeks through Week 12, and again at Weeks 16, 20, and 24.

Figure 6 Study design of study SHP-620-202 
An independent, unblinded data Monitoring Committee (DMC) reviewed available safety and safety-
related efficacy data at pre-defined time points during the study. 
Study Participants 
Study participants were male and female stem cell or solid organ transplantation recipients ≥ 12 years 
of age with documented CMV infection in blood or plasma, with a screening value of ≥1000 DNA 
copies/mL as determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or comparable quantitative 
CMV assay type and had a current CMV infection that was resistant or refractory to treatment.  
Resistant CMV was defined as documentation of one or more CMV genetic mutations associated with 
resistance to ganciclovir/valganciclovir and/or foscarnet AND documented failure to achieve >1 log 
decrease in CMV DNA level in blood/plasma after an interval of 2 or more weeks of treatment with IV 
ganciclovir, oral valganciclovir, or IV foscarnet (or any combination thereof). 
Refractory CMV was defined as documented failure to achieve >1 log decrease in CMV DNA level in 
blood/plasma after an interval of 2 or more weeks of treatment with IV ganciclovir, oral valganciclovir, 
or IV foscarnet (or any combination thereof). The definition of “refractory CMV-infection” used in study 
202, differs relevantly from the currently accepted guideline definition for the intended target 
population.  
Patients with current CMV infection that was considered resistant or refractory due to inadequate 
adherence to prior oral anti-CMV treatment and with severe hepatic impairment were excluded from 
the study. Patients who received drugs with known anti-CMV activity must have been discontinued use 
at least 14 days before the first dose of study drug. 
Treatments 
Patients received oral maribavir at one of 3 dose strengths (400 mg BID, 800 mg BID, or 1200 mg 
BID) for a maximum duration of 24 weeks. No reference product was used, but identical placebo 
tablets were used to blind the dose strengths. 
The formulation used in study 202 (formulation III) is not identical to the formulation used in the 
pivotal phase 3 study 303 (formulation IV).The applied posology (400 mg BID) with the to-be-
marketed formulation was only studied in the Phase 3 study and has undergone changes in 
manufacturing since then. The dose was selected based on in vitro antiviral efficacy data, clinical PK 
data and modelling of the E-R relationships. However, the Pop PK model is currently not considered 
adequate to support the applied dose.

Objectives 
The primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of different doses of maribavir 
administered orally for up to 24 weeks for treatment of CMV infections that are resistant or refractory 
to treatment with ganciclovir/valganciclovir or foscarnet in recipients of stem cell or solid organ 
transplants. Secondary objectives were to assess the anti-viral activity of different doses of maribavir 
in this subject population, to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of maribavir in 
this subject population and to identify a dosing regimen for treatment of CMV infection in future 
studies. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with confirmed undetectable plasma CMV DNA 
(central laboratory) within 6 weeks, defined as 2 consecutive post-baseline, on-treatment undetectable 
results (<200 copies/mL) separated by at least 5 days.  
Secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients with undetectable plasma CMV DNA (central 
laboratory) at specified visits, the proportion of patients with undetectable blood/plasma CMV at 
specified visits, the proportion of patients with CMV recurrence at any time during the study and the 
use of any protocol-specified non-study systemic anti-CMV therapies within 6 weeks and at any time 
during the study. Time to event endpoints were time to first confirmed undetectable plasma CMV DNA 
result (central laboratory) within 6 weeks and at any time during the study and time to CMV 
recurrence during the study. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Eligible patients were randomised in a 1:1:1 allocation ratio to receive oral maribavir 400 mg BID, 800 
mg BID, or 1200 mg BID after stratification by transplant type (SCT or SOT). Prior to dosing, study 
personnel contacted the interactive voice and web response system (IXRS) to obtain a study drug kit 
number. The IXRS randomised patients, using a central block randomisation process, across the entire 
study based on the stratification variable indicated above, and managed resupply of study drug kits to 
sites as necessary. 
All patients received maribavir, but patients, investigators, and study staff were blinded to dose. The 
treatment assignments of all maribavir patients remained blinded at the site level throughout the 
study. 
Statistical methods 
All primary and secondary efficacy analyses were performed using the ITT-S and PP Populations. 
Summary statistics were provided to evaluate the overall treatment effect and by dose groups effects. 
No statistical comparisons of differences were performed among the different maribavir dose groups. 
The antiviral efficacy variables that were determined are listed in section “Outcomes and endpoints”.  
The point estimates of the treatment effects (overall and by dose group) and 95% confidence intervals 
were provided for the primary efficacy endpoint and other binary and numerical endpoints. The Kaplan-
Meier method was used to estimate the survival functions using PROC LIFETEST for time-to-event 
endpoints (overall and by dose group). 
Virologic Response by Central or Local Laboratory at Weeks 3 and 6. Minimum virologic response 
criteria at week 3 was any CMV DNA decline from baseline, at week 6 ≥ 2log decline in CMV DNA from 
baseline. 
Assessment report  
EMA/792160/2022 
Page 108/109 
 
 
 
 
The virologic responses at Weeks 3 and 6 were summarised by whether the virologic response was 
based on central or local laboratory CMV DNA values. 
The analyses are acceptable for an early phase exploratory study. Nevertheless, in order make optimal 
use of the data a reasonable dose-response-regression model would have been expected, although due 
to the apparent observed flat dose response conclusions would be unlikely to be different. Due to the 
small number of groups (3), however, only a two-parameter regression model, i.e. a linear model (i.e. 
linear on the log-odds scale) would allow for interpolation, if a specific time point is used. Using the 
study data, however, a different conclusion appears unlikely.   
A specific challenge in the interpretation of the data is related to the number of missing data imputed 
by LOCF in the presence of possible recurrence. In addition, treatment discontinuation or switch will 
play a major role in the interpretation of the data. A large number of patients should have discontinued 
treatment after week 3 according to the study protocol (i.e. did not meet minimum virologic response) 
but, apparently, did continue. Since the study was not powered to show an overall dose response and 
due to the deficiencies in the applied treatment policy and response definitions it seems that the study 
was not capable to reasonably investigate a relevant dose response. In conclusion, a dose response 
could neither be demonstrated nor excluded. 
Results 
Participant flow 
In total, 129 patients screened to participate in the study, 9 were screen failure. One hundred twenty 
(120) patients were randomised in this study (ITT Population). All patients received at least 1 dose of 
study drug and were included in the ITT-S Population. Ninety-one (91) patients were included in the PP 
Population (i.e., met all study entry criteria, had a confirmed detectable plasma CMV DNA level on Day 
1 [central laboratory], and received study drug treatment through at least Week 2). One hundred 
twenty (120) patients were included in the Pharmacokinetic Population (i.e., had plasma samples 
drawn and tested for maribavir concentrations), and pharmacokinetic profile samples were collected 
from 33 patients. 
Overall, 78% of the patients withdrew from the study. The most common reason was an AE, recovery 
from CMV infection as judged by the investigator and lack of efficacy. Lack of efficacy was reported 
most frequently in the 400 mg BID group (400 mg BID: 20%; 800 mg BID: 18%; 1200 mg BID: 
15%). 
Protocol violations were recorded in nearly all patients. Many violations to inclusion and exclusion 
criteria were noted (12%). Six patient did not have confirmed viraemia > 1000 IU/mL (400 mg (N=2), 
800 mg (N=1) and 1200 mg (N=3)), six patients received prohibited medication (400 mg (N=2), 800 
mg (N=1) and 1200 mg (N=3)) or had current CMV infection that was not refractory or resistant to 
treatment of valganciclovir, ganciclovir or foscarnet (400 mg (N=1), 800 mg (N=1)).

Baseline data 
The median age of the ITT-S Population was 55 years (range: 18-74 years), and the majority of 
patients were white (79%). The percentage of males and females was 57.5% and 42.5%, respectively. 
Overall, the distribution of demographic data was similar across treatment groups. However, most 
patients with hepatic dysfunction were included in the maribavir 400 mg BID group (N=8).  
Comparable percentages of SCT and SOT recipients were included within each treatment group (overall 
maribavir: 39% and 61%, respectively). For all patients except 1, the IXRS and CRF were concordant 
with respect to transplant type with the exception of one patient in the maribavir 400 mg BID 
treatment group had SCT documented on the CRF, but SOT documented in IXRS. 
Of note, only 55% in the maribavir 400 mg BID group had reported CMV baseline genetic mutations 
associate with resistance to ganciclovir/valganciclovir or foscarnet, compared to 63% in the maribavir 
800 mg BID group and 60% in the maribavir 1200 mg group.  
Approximately 13% had CMV disease at baseline, most of them were allocated to the 800 mg and 400 
mg BID group. 
On Study Day 1, 34% of patients had acute GVHD and 15% of patients had chronic GVHD.

Numbers analysed 
A total of 120 patients were planned to be randomised. Protocol-defined analysis populations are 
shown below. The ITT-S set was used for all primary and secondary efficacy analyses supported by the 
PP Populations.  
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
Nine patients in the ITT-S had undetectable plasma CMV DNA at baseline (i.e., prior to starting study 
drug treatment on Day 1). Two were enrolled in the study in violation of inclusion criterion #4: one 
patient   in maribavir 400 mg group and  other in maribavir 800 mg group had a screening result of 
<1000 copies/mL. The remaining 7 patients met inclusion criterion #4 (i.e., had a screening value of ≥
1000 DNA copies/mL within 7 days prior to randomisation), but their viral loads decreased to 
undetectable by the time of their Day 1 visit. None of the patients were excluded from the primary 
efficacy analyses below.  
Overall, 67% of patients had confirmed undetectable plasma CMV DNA within 6 weeks after starting 
study drug treatment. No clear dose-response was seen across the study doses investigated. The

proportion of patients with undetectable plasma CMV DNA was comparable among the 3 treatment 
groups, with the numerically highest proportion of responders in the 400 mg BID (0.70 [0.53, 0.83]) 
and 1200 mg BID (0.68 [0.51, 0.81]) groups, followed by the 800 mg BID (0.63 [0.46, 0.77]) group. 
Table 47 Analysis of confirmed undetectable plasma CMV DNA within 6 weeks (central laboratory) 
(ITT-S population) 
Secondary efficacy endpoint 
The number and estimated rate of patients in the ITT-S Population who achieved undetectable plasma 
CMV DNA per the central laboratory at each specified visit showed that the proportion of patients with 
undetectable plasma CMV DNA at baseline was similar among the maribavir dose groups (estimated 
rate [95% CI]: 400 mg BID (0.10 [0.03, 0.24]), 800 mg BID (0.05 [0.01, 0.17]), and 1200 mg BID 
(0.08 [0.02, 0.20]). From Week 1 to Week 24, the proportion of patients with undetectable plasma 
CMV DNA was generally similar among the maribavir dose groups. The same was true throughout the 
follow-up period (post-treatment Weeks 1-12). 
The proportion of patients with undetectable plasma CMV DNA increased weekly to a maximum plateau 
at study Week 4 for the 400 mg BID cohort and study Week 5 for the 800 mg BID and 1200 mg BID 
cohorts and did not increase thereafter. Hence, continued treatment with maribavir did not to increase 
the proportion of responder. 
CMV Recurrence 
No statistically significant difference was seen in terms of patients with CMV recurrence. A numerically 
lower proportion of patients in the 400 mg BID maribavir group (estimated rate [95% CI]: 0.24 [0.10, 
0.44]) had CMV recurrence compared to the 800 mg BID (0.41 [0.22, 0.61]) and 1200 mg BID (0.40 
[0.23, 0.59]) groups.

Use of non-study systemic anti-CMV therapies 
More patients in the maribavir 400 mg BID group used non-study anti-CMV treatment compared to the 
800 mg BID and 1200 mg BID groups. The estimated treatment effect was numerically lower in the 
800 mg BID maribavir group (estimated rate [95% CI]: 0.08 [0.02,0.20]) than the 1200 mg BID (0.15 
[0.06, 0.30]) and 400 mg BID (0.20 [0.09, 0.36]) groups.

Virologic response by central or local laboratory at weeks 3 and 6 
At week 3 23/40 patients (58%) in the 400 mg BID group met minimal virologic response criteria of 
any decrease in CMV viral load. At study week 6, 30/40 patients (75%) in the 400 mg BID group met 
the minimal virological response criteria of ≥ 2 log reduction in CMV DNA.

Table 50 Summary of minimum virologic response criteria at weeks 3 and 6 (ITT-S population) 
Subgroup analyses were presented, however not powered to show statistically significance. According 
to the subgroup analysis the response rate in patients with baseline presence of > 1 CMV genetic RAS 
associated with resistance to ganciclovir/valgannciclovir or foscarnet was 64% in the 400 mg BID and 
was 61% for the overall maribavir group. It is of note that response rates in patients with resistance 
(202: 64% vs. 303: 44%) and in patients without resistance (202: 78% vs. 303: 13%) were higher 
than in study 303. 
Virology: 
Genotypic analyses of CMV was performed for all patients at baseline, for non-responder (not achieve 
undetectable plasma CMV DNA within 6 weeks after study start) for responders who experienced CMV 
recurrence during or after maribavir treatment and also for responder patients (if possible). 
Treatment emergent UL97 mutations T409M and H411Y developed fast and frequently on and after 
maribavir treatment, irrespective of the dose and was associated with non-response and recurrence. In 
patients who received 400 mg BID 4/6 (67%) patients selected for resistance mutations H411Y or 
T409M by treatment Week 24, compared to 6/9 (67%) in the 800 mg BID group and 3/9 (33%) 
patients who received 1200 mg BID. 
The number and range of UL27 mutations in responders and non-responders was similar. Mutation 
M418I was observed de novo in maribavir treated patients, however, the significance of this mutation 
is unknown. 
The presence of UL54 mutations was similar among responder/non-responder. Detected mutations 
were S655L, N685S,  F669L and I833M. The clinical relevance of these RAS remains unknown and 
should be monitored in future.  
SHP-620-203 
This was a phase 2, multi-centre, randomised, dose-ranging, parallel-group study of maribavir versus 
valganciclovir for the treatment of CMV infections in HSCT and SOT recipients. The study was 
conducted at 38 sites in six European countries (Austria, Belgium, Germany, France, Spain, and the 
UK).  
Approximately 160 patients were planned to be randomised in a 1:1:1:1 allocation ratio to receive oral 
maribavir at 1 of 3 dose strengths (400 mg BID, 800 mg BID, or 1200 mg BID) or valganciclovir 
(Weeks 1-3: 900 mg BID, after Week 3: 900 mg QD; with dose adjustment for renal function) for up 
to 12 weeks. To be eligible, patients must not have had CMV organ disease or a CMV infection that was

genotypically resistant to other anti-CMV drugs. Randomisation of eligible patients was stratified by 
transplant type (SCT or SOT).  
Regarding patients assigned to receive maribavir, patients, investigators, and study staff knew that 
they were receiving maribavir, but were blinded to dose strength; valganciclovir administration was 
open-label. During the study, patients were followed as either inpatients or outpatients, depending on 
their condition. An overview of the study design is provided in Figure 7. 
Patients must have achieved at least a minimum virologic response at Weeks 3 and 6 for study drug 
treatment to continue beyond each of these time points. For patients who continued dosing after the 
Week 6 visit, dosing could continue at the discretion of the investigator through a maximum of 12 
weeks in an attempt to decrease CMV DNA to undetectable, and/or to maintain undetectable CMV DNA 
in an effort to prevent recurrence of CMV infection. These patients underwent study-specific 
evaluations every 2 weeks through Week 12.

An independent, unblinded Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) reviewed available safety and safety-
related efficacy data at predefined time points during the study. 
Study Participants 
Study participants were male and female stem cell or solid organ transplantation recipients ≥ 18 years 
of age with documented CMV infection in blood or plasma, with a screening value of ≥1000 DNA to < 
100.000 copies/mL as determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or comparable 
quantitative CMV assay type and without CMV organ disease or a CMV infection that was known to be 
resistant to ganciclovir/valganciclovir, foscarnet, or cidofovir. 
Patients who received drugs with known anti-CMV activity must have been discontinued use at least 14 
days before the first dose of study drug. 
Treatments 
Patients received oral maribavir at 1 of 3 dose strengths (400 mg BID, 800 mg BID, or 1200 mg BID) 
or oral valganciclovir (Weeks 1-3: 900 mg BID, after Week 3: 900 mg QD; with dose adjustment for 
renal function) 
for a maximum duration of 12 weeks. Treatment assignment was known. However, maribavir patients 
were blinded to dose while valganciclovir administration was open-label.

The formulation used in study 202 (formulation III) is not identical to the formulation used in the 
pivotal phase 3 study 303 (formulation IV). The applied posology (400 mg BID) with the to-be-
marketed formulation was only studied in the Phase 3 study and has undergone changes in 
manufacturing since then. The dose was selected based on in vitro antiviral efficacy data, clinical PK 
data and modelling of the E-R relationships.  
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to assess the safety and tolerability of different doses of 
maribavir versus valganciclovir, administered orally for up to 12 weeks, for treatment of CMV infections 
in recipients of stem cell or solid organ transplants who do not have CMV organ disease. The secondary 
objectives of the study were to assess the antiviral activity of different doses of maribavir versus 
valganciclovir in this patient population, to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics 
(PD) of maribavir in this patient population and to identify a maribavir dosing regimen for treatment of 
CMV infections in future studies. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with confirmed undetectable plasma CMV DNA 
(central laboratory) within 3 weeks and within 6 weeks, defined as 2 consecutive post-baseline, on-
treatment undetectable results (<200 copies/mL) separated by at least 5 days.  
Secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients with undetectable plasma CMV DNA (central 
laboratory) at specified visits, the proportion of patients with undetectable blood/plasma CMV at 
specified visits, the proportion of patients with CMV recurrence at any time during the study and the 
use of any protocol-specified non-study systemic anti-CMV therapies within 6 weeks. Time to event 
endpoints were time to first confirmed undetectable plasma CMV DNA result (central laboratory) within 
6 weeks and time to CMV recurrence during the study. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Qualified patients were randomised in a 1:1:1:1 allocation ratio to receive oral maribavir at one of 
three different dose strengths or oral valganciclovir (collectively, the study drug), after stratification by 
transplant type (SCT or SOT). To ensure the ability to assess the activity of maribavir at relatively high 
viral load levels, the study targeted a minimum of approximately 25% of all randomised patients who 
had ≥10,000 CMV DNA copies/mL in plasma at baseline. 
Prior to dosing, study personnel contacted the interactive voice and web response system (IXRS) to 
obtain a study drug kit number. The IXRS randomised patients using a central block randomisation 
process across the entire study based on the stratification variable indicated above, and managed 
resupply of study drug kits to sites as necessary. 
Patients assigned to receive maribavir, patients, investigators, and study staff knew that they were 
receiving maribavir, but were blinded to dose strength; valganciclovir administration was open-label. 
The treatment assignments of all maribavir patients remained blinded at the site level throughout the 
study. 
Statistical methods 
All primary and secondary efficacy analyses were performed using the ITT-S and PP Populations. For all 
efficacy endpoints, the primary comparison of interest was the overall treatment effect evaluated by 
pooling all maribavir dose groups together versus valganciclovir. The second comparison of interest 
was to estimate the treatment effect by maribavir dose group versus valganciclovir. Valganciclovir, as

an open-label control group, provided a reference assessment of the treatment effect in the same 
study population. Summary statistics were provided to evaluate the overall treatment effect and by 
dose group effects. Statistical comparisons of interest focused primarily on differences between the 
combined maribavir group versus valganciclovir. In addition, selected efficacy endpoints were modelled 
as described below. 
Unless otherwise specified, all statistical tests were two-sided at the 0.05 level of significance. Baseline 
plasma CMV DNA and transplantation type were used as covariates to adjust the treatment effect in 
selected model analyses. No adjustments for multiple comparisons or multiplicity were made. 
The antiviral efficacy variables are described in section “Outcomes and endpoints”.  
The point estimates of the treatment effects (overall and by dose group) and 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) were provided for binary and numerical endpoints.  
Differences between maribavir (overall) and valganciclovir for binary endpoints measured within 6 
weeks were assessed using a logistic regression model (PROC LOGISTIC in SAS) with terms of 
treatment, baseline plasma CMV DNA, and transplantation type. This was an exploratory analysis; 
therefore, statistics from the logistic regression model are for summary purposes rather than 
inferential statistical comparisons among the treatments. 
Differences between maribavir (overall) and valganciclovir for all time-to-event endpoints were 
assessed using Cox proportional hazard model (PROC PHREG in SAS) with terms of treatment, baseline 
plasma CMV DNA, and transplantation type. EXACT tie handling method was applied for the Cox 
proportional hazard model analysis. In addition, PROC LIFETEST was used to estimate the survival 
functions by the Kaplan-Meier method. 
Kaplan-Meier survival curves for maribavir (overall and by dose group) vs. valganciclovir are provided. 
Number of event and censoring information are presented in the summary table and the graph of 
Kaplan-Meier survival curve. 
Differences between maribavir (overall) and valganciclovir for all numerical endpoints at Week 6 were 
assessed based on an analysis of covariance model (PROC MIXED in SAS) with terms of treatment, 
baseline plasma CMV DNA, and transplantation type. The model adjusted means and corresponding 
95% CIs are provided. The point estimates of the treatment differences and the corresponding 95% 
CIs are also provided. This was an exploratory analysis; therefore, statistics from the analysis of 
covariance model are for summary purposes rather than inferential statistical comparisons among the 
treatments. 
All analyses are considered descriptive and exploratory. No confirmatory conclusion can be drawn from 
the results. The analyses are acceptable for an early phase exploratory study.  
Results 
Participant flow 
Of the 174 patients screened to participate in this study, 13 were screen failures. One hundred sixty-
one (161) patients were randomised in this study (ITT Population,). One patient in the maribavir 1200 
mg BID group and one in the valganciclovir 900 mg BID group were randomised but did not receive 
study drug. The remaining 159 patients received at least one dose of study drug and were included in 
the ITT-S Population. 
Overall, 28% of the patients in the maribavir group and 32% of the patients in the valganciclovir group  
completed study treatment. The most common reason for discontinuation was an AE, an AE, recovery 
from CMV infection as judged by the investigator and lack of efficacy. was an AE (400 mg BID: 20%; 
800 mg BID: 13%; 1200 mg BID: 25%, valganciclovir: 15%). Recovery from CMV infection as judged

by the investigator (400 mg BID: 33%; 800 mg BID: 55%; 1200 mg BID: 30%, valganciclovir: 34%) 
and lack of efficacy, which was reported more often in the 400 mg BID group (400 mg BID: 10%; 800 
mg BID: 5%; 1200 mg BID: 5%) but was similar between the maribavir and valganciclovir group. 
Protocol violations were recoded frequently in 95% of the enrolled patients. Major protocol deviations 
were noted more frequently the overall maribavir group (13%) compared to the valganciclovir group 
(8%). Violations of inclusion/exclusion criteria were similar in both treatment groups, while use of 
prohibited medications was reported only in patients in the maribavir group.

Baseline data 
Overall, the distribution of demographic data was similar across treatment groups.The median age of 
the ITT-S Population was 58 years (range: 18-76 years), and the majority of patients were White 
(91%). The percentage of males (62%) was higher than the percentage of females (38%).

Transplant and CMV history 
Stratification by transplant type resulted in comparable percentages of SCT and SOT recipients within 
each treatment group (overall maribavir: 51% and 49%, valganciclovir: 53% and 48%, respectively). 
The majority of all patients had a primary CMV infection (78%) versus a CMV recurrence (22%). The 
percentage of patients with a primary infection was 82% in the overall maribavir group and was higher 
compared to 68% in the valganciclovir group.  
On Study Day 1, 26% of patients in the maribavir group and 38% in the valganciclovir group had acute 
GVHD and 8% in the maribavir group and 19% of patients had chronic GVHD. 
Patients with known CMV organ disease or resistant mutations were excluded from the study. This 
study population represents patients expected to be earlier in the course of their CMV infection 
compared to the study populations of Studies 202 or 303 and does not cover the proposed target 
indication. 
Numbers analysed 
A total of 160 patients were planned to be randomised. Protocol-defined analysis populations are 
shown below. The ITT-S set was used for all primary and secondary efficacy analyses supported by the 
PP Populations.  
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
Of the 159 patients in the ITT-S Population, fourteen patients (9%) had undetectable plasma CMV DNA 
at baseline. 10 patients (8%) in the overall maribavir group of which four were enrolled in the 400 mg 
BID dose group and 4 patients (10%) in the valganciclovir group.  
Four patients were enrolled in the study in violation of inclusion criterion #3: one in the maribavir 400 
mg group and one in the maribavir 800 mg group had a screening result of <1,000 copies/mL, and two 
patients in the valganciclovir group were enrolled based on a sample drawn >7 days prior to the 
initiation of study drug. The remaining 10 patients met inclusion criterion #3 (i.e., had a screening 
value of 1,000 to 100,000 DNA copies/mL within 7 days prior to the initiation of study drug), but their 
viral loads decreased to undetectable by the time of their Day 1 visit.  
All 14 patients were considered to have achieved confirmed undetectable plasma CMV DNA within 3 
and 6 weeks after starting study drug treatment in the primary analysis.

Table 52 Patients with confirmed undetectable plasma CMV DNA ((Central Laboratory) within 3 and 6 
weeks  (ITT-S population) 
No clear dose-response was seen across the study doses investigated. The proportion of patients with 
undetectable plasma CMV DNA within 3 weeks after starting study drug treatment was numerically 
higher in the overall maribavir group than the valganciclovir group: estimate (95% CI), 0.62 (0.52, 
0.70) vs. 0.56 (0.40, 0.72); odds ratio, 1.4 (p=0.4107). 
Within 6 weeks, the proportion of patients with undetectable plasma CMV DNA was numerically higher 
in the overall maribavir group than the valganciclovir group: estimate (95% CI), 0.79 (0.70, 0.86) vs. 
0.67 (0.50, 0.81); odds ratio, 2.1 (p=0.0822). Among maribavir groups, the proportion of patients 
with undetectable plasma CMV DNA was numerically highest in the 800 mg BID group (0.83 [0.67, 
0.93]) compared with the 400 mg BID (0.79 [0.64, 0.91]) and 1200 mg BID groups (0.74 [0.57, 
0.87]). 
Secondary efficacy endpoint 
One week after starting study drug treatment, the proportion of patients with undetectable plasma 
CMV DNA was 0.26 (0.18, 0.35) in the overall maribavir group and 0.43 (0.27, 0.59) in the 
valganciclovir group. At Week 2, the proportion of patients who were undetectable was still numerically 
lower in the overall maribavir group (0.48 [0.39, 0.57]) than the valganciclovir group (0.53 [0.36, 
0.68]). 
The proportion of patients with undetectable plasma CMV DNA increased weekly to a maximum plateau 
at study Week 4 for the 400 mg BID cohort and study Week 5 for the 800 mg BID and 1200 mg BID

cohorts indicating that continued treatment beyond 4-5 weeks did not increase the proportion of 
responders. If continued treatment was responsible for maintenance of response rate is difficult to 
interpret considering the high numbers of patients who did have imputed values per LOCF due to 
discontinuation of the study. Furthermore, LOCF imputation might not be the best option to assess 
response over time, considering the high number of recurrences observed in CMV patients. 
Throughout the follow-up period (post-treatment Weeks 1 to 12), a numerically higher proportion of 
patients in the overall maribavir group had undetectable plasma CMV DNA compared with the 
valganciclovir group. 
CMV recurrence within the study participation was numerically higher in the overall maribavir group 
compared to the valganciclovir group estimate (95% CI), 0.22 (0.15, 0.32) vs. 0.18 (0.06, 0.37); odds 
ratio, 1.3 (p=0.6843).  
A dose-related trend was observed among maribavir groups, as the proportion of patients with 
recurrence was 0.30 (0.16, 0.49), 0.24 (0.11, 0.41), and 0.13 (0.04, 0.30) in the 400 mg BID, 800 mg 
BID, and 1200 mg BID groups, respectively. This indicates that maintenance of response after 
treatment cessation is lower in patients treated with maribavir 400 mg BID compared to higher doses 
and valganciclovir. 
Table 53 Analysis of CMV recurrence within the study participation period (ITT-S population) 
Median observed time from confirmed undetectable plasma CMV DNA to CMV recurrence was 
numerically shorter in the overall maribavir group (72 days) than the valganciclovir group (80 days).  
Among maribavir groups, median time from confirmed undetectable plasma CMV DNA to CMV 
recurrence was numerically longest in the 1200 mg BID group (84 days), followed by the 400 mg BID 
group (72 days) and the 800 mg BID group (43 days). 
Recurrence on treatment (6%) and off treatment (24%) were highest in the 400 mg BID group 
compared to the 800 mg BID an (6% and 18%) 1200 mg BID group (0% and 13%). Notably, none of 
the patients in the valganciclovir experienced CMV recurrence while on study drug, while 18% had CMV 
recurrence off treatment. 
Median observed time from last dose of study drug to CMV recurrence was numerically longer in the 
overall maribavir group (28 days) than the valganciclovir group (23 days). Among maribavir groups,

median time from last dose of study drug to CMV recurrence was numerically longer in the 400 mg BID 
(28 days) and 1200 mg BID groups (28 days) compared with the 800 mg BID group (8 days). 
Patients with recurrence discontinued maribavir due to lack of efficacy and had developed treatment 
emergent UL97 T409M (known to confer resistance to maribavir). UL27 RAS Q424H was also detected 
in one patient. Both were not present at baseline.  
The proportion of patients who used non-study anti-CMV therapies within 6 weeks was numerically 
lower in the overall maribavir group than the valganciclovir group: estimate (95% CI), 0.15 (0.09, 
0.23) vs. 0.20 (0.09, 0.36); odds ratio, 0.7 (p=0.3920). Among maribavir groups, the proportion of 
patients who used non-study anti-CMV therapies was numerically lowest in the 800 mg BID group 
(0.10 [0.03, 0.24]) compared with the 400 mg BID (0.18 [0.07, 0.33]) and 1200 mg BID groups (0.18 
[0.08, 0.34]). 
The Kaplan-Meier estimate for time to confirmed undetectable plasma CMV DNA within 6 weeks was 
numerically longer in the overall maribavir group than the valganciclovir group: median (95% CI), 21 
days (15 days, 22 days) vs. 17 days (8 days, 25 days); hazard ratio, 1.2 (p=0.4979). Among 
maribavir groups, the estimated time to confirmed undetectable plasma CMV DNA was numerically 
shortest in the 400 mg BID group (15 days [15 days, 22 days]), followed by the 1200 mg BID group 
(21 days [14 days, 22 days]) and the 800 mg BID group (22 days [16 days, 29 days]). 
Descriptive subgroup analysis for the primary endpoint and CMV recurrence were provided. Due to the 
small number of patients in many of the subgroups, meaningful comparisons of the overall maribavir 
and valganciclovir groups could not be made. 
Virology 
Genotypic analyses of CMV were performed for all patients at baseline, for non-responder (not achieve 
undetectable plasma CMV DNA within 6 weeks after study start) for responders who experienced CMV 
recurrence during or after maribavir treatment and also for responder patients (if possible). 
Treatment-emergent UL97 mutation T409M developed fast and frequently in maribavir treated patients 
and was associated with virological failure. T409M mutations are known to be associated with high-
level resistance to maribavir and provided data indicate that they might also confer cross-resistance to 
valganciclovir. Notably, the presence of treatment-emergent T409M mutation was only detected in 
those specimens collected from patients who received maribavir at 400 mg or 800 mg BID. It remains 
unclear whether suboptimal concentrations of maribavir after 400 mg BID might have contributed to 
the fast development of resistance associated mutations. 
A few UL27 gene mutations were described for non-responders or responders with recurrence; 
however, there appeared to be several of these mutations described for CMV isolated from complete 
responders (ie. no recurrence) at screening so the clinical relevance remains currently unknown. 
Based on the provided resistance data, it seems that T409M RAS develops fast under maribavir 
treatment and is associated with virological failure, indicating a low barrier of resistance. Doses of 
1200 mg BID did not result in treatment emergent development of resistance and seem to yield higher 
efficacious concentrations than 400 mg BID and 800 mg BID. 
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The demonstration of the efficacy and safety data for maribavir, rests on one pivotal Phase 3 study 
(SHP-620-303) and the two supportive Phase 2 studies SHP620-202 and SHP620-203. However, these 
supportive studies were conducted in two different patient populations with two different formulations 
Assessment report

Page 123/124 
 
 
 
of maribavir than study 303 and study 202 lacks a control arm, thus can only consider supportive of 
the antiviral activity.   
Dose selection 
The applied posology (400 mg BID) using the to-be-marketed formulation was only studied in the 
Phase 3 study and has undergone changes in manufacturing since then (please refer to the Q AR). The 
dose was selected based on in vitro antiviral efficacy data, clinical PK data and modelling of the E-R 
relationships. However, the Pop PK model is currently not considered adequate to provide ancillary 
support of the applied dose. Furthermore, the PK data indicate that through exposure after 400 mg 
maribavir BID dosing is very close to the target minimum effective concentration (please refer to the 
PD section of this report for details). This may impact the durability of response and facilitate the 
development of resistance. However, due to the flat dose-response in this exposure interval, higher 
doses of maribavir are not considered to result in better response rates. Nevertheless, the exposure 
from the 400 mg BID regimen should be considered on the lower level of the therapeutic index. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study SHP 620-303 
The SHP 620-303 study was a multi-centre, randomised, open-label, active-controlled study to assess 
the efficacy and safety of maribavir compared to investigator-assigned treatment (IAT) in 
Haematopoetic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients with CMV 
infections that were refractory to treatment with ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, or cidofovir, 
including CMV infections with confirmed resistance to 1 or more anti-CMV agents. The primary 
endpoint was CMV viraemia clearance at the end of study week eight, regardless of whether study-
assigned treatment was discontinued before the end of stipulated 8 weeks of therapy. The analysis 
population included 352 patients (maribavir: 235 patients; IAT: 117 patients). 
CMV DNA viraemia clearance as primary endpoint is a valid endpoint. Confirmed clearance of CMV 
viraemia is an objective and validated surrogate marker. CMV viraemia has been shown to predict 
development of CMV disease in transplant recipients as well as mortality, has been used in clinical 
trials and is recommended by international CMV treatment guidelines and is therefore considered 
acceptable. 
The chosen active control arm including anti-CMV drugs ganciclovir, valganciclovir and foscarnet, are 
empirically used to treat CMV infection and are considered acceptable as active comparator due to 
ethical reasons.  
In assigning a patient to a specific IAT in the IAT group, the investigator was to use all available 
information to assign the best available therapy for a given patient resulting in a greater heterogeneity 
of patients in the IAT arm compared to the maribavir arm. As a consequence, a patient in the IAT 
could not be refractory to their assigned therapy (a requirement for enrolment in study 303) and may 
or may not have received treatment with a drug to which their CMV was resistant based on the clinical 
judgment of the investigator. Apparently, no “management algorithm for CMV patients with suspected 
drug resistance” as recommended by current CMV-guidelines was in place and documentation of the 
investigator’s clinical rational for choosing the IAT is not informative.  
In total, 23 % of the enrolled study population did not have central laboratory confirmed CMV DNA 
≥910 IU/mL and 6 % did not have refractory disease, hence did not meet inclusion criteria for study 
enrolment.

A triggered GCP inspection for the clinical study SHP620-303 was conducted and showed that the 
design, outcomes and data presentation of the study are prone to serious criticism. The final integrated 
GCP report of the sponsor inspection and two clinical sites in Belgium and Germany were recently 
shared with EMA. At the sponsor site one critical, 12 major and three minor findings were reported. 
The GCP inspectors stated that the presentation of trial results in the CSR is misleading, as delineation 
of the different contributing factors to the composite endpoint failed. Major inconsistencies of the 
presented failure data between the CSR, resistance report and response document and compared to 
those analysed during the GCP inspection and given in the publicity available FDA errata list were 
identified, which may impact the data quality. The GCP inspectors highlighted that the presentation of 
trial results should not be used for assessment without additional information. By clearly distinguishing 
between potency and tolerability, the trial medication can be assessed appropriately. 
Based on the findings of the GCP inspection, the internal validity of study data has been impacted by 
the lack of sufficient control of bias. Potential bias has been introduced in the statistical analysis by 
post randomisation changes, major inconsistency of the presented failure data, and the lack of 
sufficient measures to avoid and control for such bias. Further, the comparator IAT was defined as 
non-IMP, thus patients would have to co-pay the treatment in some countries like the US. These issues 
could have negatively impacted the results in the investigator-assigned therapy (IAT) arm and explain 
the high rate of failures other than lack of virological clearance in the IAT arm. However, overall the 
data were deemed sufficiently reliable for regulatory decision-making. 
Study SHP 620-202 
The study SHP 620-202 was a phase 2, randomised study to assess the safety and anti-
cytomegalovirus (CMV) activity of different doses of maribavir for the treatment of CMV infections that 
are resistant or refractory to treatment with ganciclovir/valganciclovir or foscarnet in transplant 
recipients. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with confirmed undetectable plasma 
CMV DNA (central laboratory) within 6 weeks. Patients must have achieved at least a minimum 
virologic response at Weeks 3 and 6 for continuation of study drug treatment beyond each of these 
time points. For patients who continued dosing after the Week 6 visit, dosing could continue at the 
discretion of the investigator through a maximum of 24 weeks. The analysis population included 120 
patients (400 mg BID: 40 patients; 800 mg BID: 40 patients 1200 mg BID: 40 patients). 
The enrolled study population was similar to the population enrolled in study 303 and the proposed 
target population of maribavir. However, this was a dose-ranging trial without a control arm. Hence, 
interpretation of the efficacy results should be done with caution, due to the lack of an adequate 
control arm, i.e. in the absence of a dose-response relation, this study does not isolate drug effects. 
The conclusion of this study, however, is that higher doses than the labelled one, are not anticipated to 
increase antiviral activity or the barrier to resistance.  
Study SHP 620-203 
Study 203 was a Phase 2, multi-centre, randomised, parallel-group, dose ranging study to assess the 
safety and anti CMV activity of 400 mg, 800 mg and 1200 mg twice daily maribavir versus 
valganciclovir for up to 12 weeks for the treatment of 159 SOT or HSCT recipients with CMV infection 
without CMV organ disease or resistant/refractory CMV infection. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was confirmed undetectable plasma CMV DNA (central laboratory) within 
3 weeks and confirmed undetectable plasma CMV DNA (central laboratory) within 6 weeks. Patients 
must have achieved at least a minimum virologic response at Weeks 3 and 6 for continuation of study 
drug treatment beyond each of these time points. For patients who continued dosing after the Week 6 
visit, dosing could continue at the discretion of the investigator through a maximum of 12 weeks. The 
Assessment report

analysis population included 159 patients (400 mg BID: 40 patients; 800 mg BID: 40 patients, 1200 
mg BID: 39 patients and valganciclovir: 40 patients). 
Importantly, because study 203 excluded patients with known CMV organ disease and genotypic 
resistance, the study population was different from the study population in study 303. This study is 
considered explorative, but supports that maribavir exhibits antiviral activity against CMV. 
The formulation used in study 202 and 203 (formulation III) is not identical to the formulation used in 
the pivotal phase 3 study 303 (formulation IV). In order to show that the differences in the dissolution 
profiles between the relevant pivotal clinical batches and the commercial batches of the drug product 
have no clinical relevance a comparison of the results of the food effect study TAK-620-1025 (batch 
PPQ 4559589) in the fasted state with the results of studies TAK-620-1019 (batch XXVG) and SHP620-
115 (batch STDH) was performed. The GMRs for AUC - which is the relevant PK parameter for efficacy 
- are within the bioequivalence interval of 0.8 to 1.25 indicating that the commercial batch and the 
batches used during clinical development are comparable. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
SHP620-303 
The definition of refractory used in study 303, i.e. documented failure to achieve ≥1 log10 decrease in 
CMV DNA levels after 14 days or longer treatment, is not in line with current clinical treatment 
guidelines. This definition rather reflects the definition for “probable refractory CMV infection” 
(Chenaly et al., 2019). The current definition of refractory CMV infection is “CMV viraemia that 
increases (i.e. ≥ 1 log increase in CMV DNA levels) after at least 14 days of appropriately dosed 
antiviral therapy”. Furthermore, patients with persistent CMV DNA titres <1000 IU/mL and particular 
detected but not quantifiable (<137 IU/mL) should not be considered refractory.  
The Applicant was asked to clarify how many of the enrolled patients met the following definition of 
refractory: “CMV viraemia that increases (i.e. ≥ 1 log increase in CMV DNA levels) after at least 14 
days of appropriately dosed antiviral therapy. No information could be given on how many of the 
enrolled patients met the currently guideline conform definition of refractory, as the viral load data 
collected prior to screening to determine eligibility (Inclusion Criterion#4) was not collected in the 
database. Hence, verification of the refractory status of patients enrolled in study 303 is not possible. 
Furthermore, the study definition of refractory allowed a wide interpretability, the duration of the 
treatment for the determination of refractory CMV were in part clearly undercut and no specified 
reference value to document “refractory CMV” was given. It is of note, that the analysed protocol 
defined population (refractory/resistant) includes participants who do not meet the study definition of 
refractory/resistant. Due to the lack of documentation of relevant data for defining the “refractory” 
status and lack of adherence to the study 303 definition of „refractory“, it is not possible to verify how 
many of the patients were “refractory”. 
The analyses for the primary endpoint showed that the proportion of patients achieving confirmed CMV 
viraemia clearance at week 8 was higher in the MBV group compared to the IAT group (56% compared 
to 24%, adjusted difference in proportion of responders: 32.8 % (95%CI: 22.80, 42.74, p=<0.001). 
Efficacy results for the key secondary endpoint demonstrated that more patients in the maribavir 
achieved CMV viraemia clearance and CMV infection symptom control at Week 8, with maintenance of 
this treatment effect through Week 16 compared with patients in the IAT group (19% vs 10%, 
respectively). The adjusted treatment difference (95% CI) in proportion of responders between the 
treatment groups was 9.5 (2.02, 16.88), p=0.013.

Concerns regarding potential bias and overestimation were addressed by sensitivity analyses with 
varying levels of conservativeness, which are in general consistent with the primary analysis. The 
following may be considered the key sensitivity analyses with respect to the robustness of the efficacy 
demonstration: 
A) 
Subjects who discontinued prematurely without alternative anti-CMV or maribavir rescue are 
included as responders if they meet the criteria for confirmed viraemia clearance criteria at the time of 
discontinuation based on their last available CMV DNA before Week 8. 
B) 
Subjects who either switched to alternative anti-CMV or maribavir rescue or prematurely 
discontinued with missing data were included as responders if they met the criteria for of confirmed 
viraemia clearance at time of their treatment switch or at the time of premature discontinuation based 
on their last available CMV DNA before Week 8. 
C) 
Subjects with confirmed viraemia clearance at the end of study-assigned treatment 
discontinuation were counted as responders. 
All of these analyses show statistically significant superiority for Livtencity. 
A very conservative analysis was performed in which subjects with confirmed viraemia clearance at 
Week 8 regardless of switch to alternative anti-CMV treatment or to maribavir rescue treatment were 
counted as responders, and subjects who prematurely discontinued from the study or had other 
reasons for missing data before Week 8 were counted as responders if they met the criteria for 
confirmed viraemia clearance criteria based on the last available CMV DNA values before Week 8. This 
shows numerical superiority of Livtencity to its comparator. 
 Data indicate that the superiority of maribavir to IAT in study 303 is mainly driven by the intolerability 
of the IAT options. In order to evaluate the potential impact of the differential treatment 
discontinuation or switch and the change in primary endpoint, a set of sensitivity analyses for the 
primary and key secondary endpoints was requested. To get more relevant result in terms of a 
treatment policy estimand, an analysis was requested that uses all available CMV values and imputes 
the remaining missing values. The provided sensitivity analyses shown that the statistical superiority of 
maribavir disappears when the actually measured CMV DNA values are used (irrespective of the 
different intercurrent events) and remaining missing data are imputed using different imputation 
models. 
All analyses were to be provided with and without patients who did not have CMV viral load >910 
IU/mL per central lab at the time of randomisation (N=82), patients who were not refractory at 
baseline (N=21) and should include the six patients in the IAT arm as responders that were assigned 
to the maribavir rescue arm without meeting the eligibility criteria. Exclusion of these patients from the 
analyses highlight that responses seen in study 303 may have been influenced by inclusion of patients 
that did not meet inclusion criteria, as the statistical evidence is further reduced. 
However, apparently, CMV values after treatment switch were set to missing despite a large number of 
participants with measured CMV values after treatment switch. This is of major importance as any post 
baseline treatment change may have been influenced by the open treatment group assignment.  
Notably, the study protocol underwent six amendments including substantial changes of the definition 
of the primary and key secondary endpoint during the conduct of the study. The initial version of the 
SAP was finalised on 30 May 2018, i.e. more than 17 months after the first patient was enrolled. Three 
amendments were generated after that date. Finalisation of the SAP just before database lock at the 
end of an open-label study, where results are obtained during the study may influence the analysis 
and, hence, compromise proper type-1 error control. However, as only one patient was enrolled at the 
time of Amendment 3, it can be concluded that the change of the primary and secondary endpoint and

analysis was not done in in knowledge of any intermediate study outcome. Nevertheless, in the 
absence of measures to avoid or minimise bias, it cannot be excluded that due to post-randomisation 
changes significant bias to the statistical analysis was introduced that may have led to a potential 
structural disadvantage for the IAT arm. This was also highlighted during the GCP inspection. Overall, 
however, data are sufficiently robust for decision-making.  
Concerning the key secondary endpoint, all patients who achieved CMV viraemia clearance at week 8 
also had CMV infection symptom control at week 8 (maribavir: 131 patients, IAT 28 patients). More 
patients in the maribavir achieved CMV viraemia clearance and CMV infection symptom control at 
Week 8, with maintenance of this treatment effect through Week 16 compared with patients in the IAT 
group (19% vs 10%, respectively). The adjusted treatment difference (95% CI) in proportion of 
responders between the treatment groups was 9.5 (2.02, 16.88), p=0.013.  
The clinical judgement of CMV symptom control was categorised by the investigator and verified by an 
EAC after the study completion and therefore the analysis was prone to bias considering the open label 
of the study. In addition, the definition of symptomatic CMV infection was changed late during the 
open-label study to include both tissue-invasive CMV disease and CMV syndrome. 
The CMV symptom status relative to baseline in symptomatic patients (i.e., resolution, improvement, 
no change, or worsening) and the emergence of new CMV disease during the study (in previously 
asymptomatic patients or patients with ongoing CMV disease) was confirmed by an independent and 
blinded EAC. Only a small number of patients (N=29) had EAC confirmed CMV symptomatic disease. 
Imbalances concerning the distribution of patients with EAC confirmed symptomatic infection across 
treatment arms (IAT: 8 patients (6.8%), maribavir: 21 (8.9 %). In the maribavir group, 10/21 
(47.6%) patients with CMV syndrome/disease at baseline per the EAC achieved CMV viraemia 
clearance at Week 8 compared with 1/8 (12.5%) patients in the IAT group.  
The EAC confirmed 22 cases of new onset symptomatic CMV infection in 21 patients (maribavir: 14 
[6.0%) patients; IAT: 7 [6.0%] patients). All patients with new onset symptomatic CMV infection at 
Week 8 (MBV: 7 patients, IAT: 5 patients) were non-responders for the primary endpoint. 
Interestingly, more patients who were primary responders had new onset symptomatic CMV infection, 
5/14 maribavir-treated patients compared to none in the IAT treated patients. Hence, it seems that 
recurrence of CMV disease after cessation of therapy is more common in patients treated with 
maribavir. This would be in line with the data and sensitivity analysis related to the key secondary 
endpoint, indicating that sustainability of viraemia clearance and symptom control is not substantial 
with maribavir treatment, compatible with a low barrier to resistance. 
This is further illustrated by the fact that recurrence of CMV viraemia during study 303 was seen in 
57% of the maribavir treated patients and in 34% of the IAT treated patients. Of these, 18% in the 
maribavir group had recurrence of CMV viraemia while on-treatment compared to 12% in the IAT 
group. Recurrence of CMV viraemia during follow up was seen in 39% of patients in the maribavir 
group and in 22% of the patients in the IAT group.  
No effect of maribavir on mortality was seen. A similar percentage of patients in each treatment group 
died during the study (maribavir: 27 [11.5%] patients; IAT: 13 [11.1%] patients). Median time to 
death was shorted in the maribavir compared to the IAT group. 
Subgroup analyses for the primary and key secondary endpoint were not powered to demonstrate 
statistical significance; hence interpretation of the data should be done with caution.  
According to the study protocol, central lab testing was not required for randomisation and local testing 
was sufficient. However, based on central lab results 82 patients were included in the study although 
they did not meet the inclusion criteria of >910 IU/mL. It is of note that the central lab (COBAS) assay 
used in study 303 for CMV viral load determination was consistently 0.5 log less sensitive than local

laboratory results. In addition, the COBAS assay was the less sensitive assay on the market, which was 
already known at the time of study initiation (Preiksaitiset al, 2016 Clinical Infectious Disease). A 
sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint excluding those 82 patients who failed to achieve 
>910 IU/mL on both the central and the local lab testing, was provided, which still showed superiority 
of maribavir, although reduced. 
Subgroup analyses by transplant type (HCST or SOT) indicate no difference concerning efficacy.

Clinical virology 
Genotypic sequencing was performed for study patient samples with CMV DNA viral load at and above 
the predefined cut-off level of 500 copies/mL (455 IU/mL) at protocol defined time points at baseline, 
during the treatment phase, during the study follow-up phase, and at the end of the study. Patients 
with at least one known resistance-associated amino acid substitution (RAS) to IAT in pUL97 and/or 
pUL54 identified at baseline were included in the primary resistance set (PRS), while patients without 
identified baseline IAT RASs were designated to the non-PRS set (“refractory”). Similarily, all patients 
with at least one known RAS to maribavir in pUL97 and/or pUL27 at baseline were included in the 
maribavir resistance set (MRS), while patients without identified baseline maribavir RASs were 
designated non-MRS. 
Despite attempts to genotype all patient samples at baseline, some baseline samples could not be 
genotyped. Bassline genotypic results for PRS were available for 89% of the patients in the IAT arm 
and for 93% in the maribavir arm. Baseline genotypic results for MRS were available for 86% in the 
IAT arm and 92% in the maribavir arm.  
Baseline imbalances were noted between the treatment arms. More patients in the IAT arm (60%) had 
baseline resistance to at least one IAT, compared to patients in the maribavir arm (52%). 
Consequently, more patients in the maribavir arm (41%) had no baseline resistance to IAT compared 
to patients in the IAT arm (29%).  
In the virus of four patients baseline RAS known to confer resistance to maribavir were identified (IAT: 
3 patients, MBV group: 1 patient).  
Primary resistance set (PRS) outcome: 
More than half of the patients (57%) identified as having one or more baseline RASs known to confer 
resistance to ganciclovir/valganciclovir received ganciclovir/valganciclovir as the IAT.  
Most patients had CMV encoding IAT RAS at baseline. More patients in the IAT group had virus 
encoding for baseline IAT RAS in pUL97 (75% vs. 72%), IAT RAS to pUL54 (6% vs. 7%) and in both 
pUL97 and pUL54 (19% vs. 22%) compared to patients in the maribavir arm.

The most common single baseline IAT RASs identified in pUL97 in the IAT group were A594V, L595S , 
C603W, F342Y, M460I, M460V, C592G, H520Q and L595F. Most of this RAS are known to confer 
a high-level of resistance to ganciclovir/valganciclovir. The F342Y RAS has been reported to cause 
increases in EC50 for both GCV (6.0-fold) and maribavir (4.5-fold). 
The most common single baseline IAT RASs detected in pUL97 in the maribavir group were L595S, 
A594V, C603W, M460I, M460V, C592G, A594P, A594T, H520Q, and L595F. Most of this RAS are 
known to confer a high level of resistance to ganciclovir/valganciclovir. With respect to multiple IAT 
RASs, the double pUL97 A594V+L595S RAS was detected with the highest frequency. Individually, 
both of these IAT RASs are associated with GCV resistance. 
Results of the maribavir rescue arm indicate that response in patients who switch to maribavir was 
limited and not sustained. Furthermore, development of treatment emergent RAS to maribavir was 
seen in many patients. 
Post-baseline treatment emergent RAS to IAT was more frequently observed in the maribavir group 
(13%) compared to the IAT group (5%). This effect was consistent for RAS to IAT in the pUL97 
(maribavir: 9% and IAT: 3%). This is cause of concern, as it suggests that maribavir not only selects 
for RAS to maribavir but also for IAT RAS with a potential to confer cross-resistance. Considering that 
treatment-emergent RAS under IAT were less commonly selected than with maribavir, maribavir 
seems to have a lower barrier to resistance development to IAT than IATs themselves.  
Overall, 44/235 patients (19%) in the maribavir arm had treatment emergent RAS to IAT. Of these 28 
patients (55%) had C480F or the F342Y RAS, both of which are cross-resistant to both 
ganciclovir/valganciclovir and maribavir. Notably, only 8/44 (18%) patients with treatment emergent 
RAS to IAT achieved the primary endpoint. At present it remains unclear, if the 24 patients with 
treatment emergent C480F or the F342Y RAS, both of which are cross-resistant to both 
ganciclovir/valganciclovir and maribavir did or did not achieve the primary endpoint. 
Important identified treatment-emergent IAT RAS in the maribavir group were: C480F and F342Y, both 
confer high-level resistance to maribavir but also confer resistance to ganciclovir/valganciclovir and 
A594V, C603W, L595F/S all confer high-level resistance to ganciclovir. 
Furthermore, IAT RAS in pUL54 were detected more frequently in the maribavir group (N=8) compared 
to the IAT group (N=1). While all treatment-emergent RAS in pUL54 only account for one patient each, 
they do confer cross resistance to either foscarnet (S290R, V715M), cidofovir and ganciclovir (N408D, 
T503I, K513N and A789G) or to all of them (L773V).  
These findings indicate that maribavir treatment may select for RAS conferring potential cross-
resistance to IAT. 
Maribavir resistance set (MRS) outcome: 
Baseline resistance to maribavir was uncommon. With the exception of one pUL27 RAS (L193R) in the 
maribavir group, all other mutations were detected in the pUL97 region. pUL97 F342YF maribavir RAS 
was the only RAS detected in the IAT group, which was also detected at baseline in the one patient in 
the maribavir rescue arm.   
None of the patients with CMV encoding baseline RAS to maribavir did respond to treatment. Results of 
the patients in the IAT group indicate that pUL97 F342Y RAS confers cross-resistance to IAT, as no 
response was seen among the three patients. Furthermore, F342Y at baseline was associated with 
non-response in the one patient in the maribavir rescue arm. 
No response was seen in the one patient in maribavir group who had CMV with baseline pUL27 L193F 
maribavir RAS. The clinical relevance of pUL27 L193F remains unclear.

Treatment emergent RAS to maribavir were only observed in maribavir treated patients, i.e. 60/214 
(29%). Of these 21% had RAS to maribavir detected on–treatment, while 8% were found to have 
maribavir RAS after treatment cessation. Of the 42 patients in the maribavir-randomised analysis 
group who developed post-baseline maribavir RASs, 41/42 patients (98%) did not achieve the primary 
endpoint, while one patient did. Of these 42 patients, 18/42 patients (43%) were virologic non-
responders (did not achieve viraemia clearance at any time point during the study) and 24/42 patients 
(57%) were virologic responders. Of these 24 virologic responders, 21/24 patients (88%) had 
recurrence on or off treatment. 
All treatment-emergent RAS to maribavir were identified in pUL97, indicating that this is the major 
region responsible for conferring resistance to maribavir. The most frequently detected post-bassline 
RAS to maribavir on treatment were T409M, C480F, H411Y, H411N and F342Y. Mutations F342Y and 
C480Fare also known to confer resistance to ganciclovir. In addition, several multiple RAS to maribavir 
were detected, the most common were T409M+C480F and T409M+H411Y. The impact on maribavir 
and ganciclovir/valganciclovir EC50s of these multiple RAS is currently unclear. 
Off treatment, the most frequently detected maribavir RAS was H411Y, C480F and T409M.  
These data indicate that maribavir has a low barrier to resistance, as resistance development occurred 
fast during treatment and also after treatment cessation. Development of multiple RAS was seen 
frequently on treatment. The clinical impact of double mutations remain unclear but it is anticipated 
that they are associated with non-response. Therefore, this information is reflected in the SmPC. 
Study SHP620-202 
Data do not indicate a dose-response effect across the three doses tested. Within six weeks, 70% of 
the patients in the 400 mg BID group, 63% in the 800 mg group and 68% in the 1200 mg BID 
maribavir group had undetectable CMV DNA. It is of note, that the nine patients in the ITT-S who had 
undetectable plasma CMV DNA at baseline (i.e., prior to starting study drug treatment on Day 1) were 
counted as responders in the primary efficacy analysis. 
Data over time indicate that the proportion of patients with undetectable plasma CMV DNA increased 
weekly to a maximum plateau at study Week 4 for the 400 mg BID cohort and study Week 5 for the 
800 mg BID and 1200 mg BID cohorts and did not increase thereafter. These results indicate that 
continued beyond 6 weeks did not result in an increase of responders.  
No statistically significant difference was seen in terms of CMV recurrence. A numerically lower 
proportion of patients in the 400 mg BID maribavir group (estimated rate [95% CI]: 0.24 [0.10, 0.44]) 
had CMV recurrence compared to the 800 mg BID (0.41 [0.22, 0.61]) and 1200 mg BID (0.40 [0.23, 
0.59]) groups. 
Time to undetectable CMV DNA within six weeks was numerically shorter in the 1200 mg BID group, 
compared to the 400 mg BID and 800 mg BID group. Time from undetectable CMV DNA to CMV 
recurrence was numerically shorter in the 400 mg BID group (36 days) and the 800 mg BID group (36 
days) compared to the 1200 mg BID group (82 days). Recurrence occurred predominantly on study 
drug and were associated with treatment-emergent UL97 RAS. 
Notably, the response rate in patients with baseline presence of > 1 CMV genetic RAS associated with 
resistance to ganciclovir/valganciclovir or foscarnet was 64% in the 400 mg BID and 61% for the 
overall maribavir group. It is of note that response rates in patients with resistance (202: 64% vs. 
303: 44%) and in patients without resistance (202: 78% vs. 303: 63%) were generally higher than in 
study 303.

Study SHP620-203 
Efficacy data of study 203 do not indicate a dose-response effect between the three doses tested. The 
proportion of patients with undetectable plasma CMV DNA within 3 weeks was numerically higher in 
the overall maribavir group than the valganciclovir group: estimate (95% CI), 0.62 (0.52, 0.70) vs. 
0.56 (0.40, 0.72); odds ratio, 1.4 (p=0.4107), however no statistically significant effect was seen. 
Among maribavir groups, the proportion of patients with undetectable plasma CMV DNA was 
numerically highest in the 400 mg BID group (0.67 [0.50, 0.81]) compared with the 800 mg BID (0.58 
[0.41, 0.73]) and 1200 mg BID groups (0.61 [0.43, 0.76]). A similar trend was observed within 6 
weeks. 
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
This application is based on the pivotal trial -303. This has demonstrated the efficacy of maribavir in 
the target population. However, due to a low barrier to resistance, the durability of response may be 
limited.   
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
The clinical safety database includes data from two Phase 2 and one Phase 3 studies of maribavir as a 
CMV treatment in transplant recipients, three Phase 2 and 3 studies of maribavir for CMV prevention in 
transplant recipients, 17 Phase 1 studies, and 1 taste assessment study. 
The focus of the safety data provided is placed on pivotal Study 303, which provides the safety 
experience most relevant to the target population. Data from Phase 2 and Phase 1 studies were not 
integrated into safety analysis due to the differences in patient populations and/or study designs as 
well as differences in dosages and treatment duration across the studies. Studies 202 and 203 are 
considered supportive of the target indication. 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
A total of 1,555 patients have been exposed to maribavir across a broad range of doses (50 mg to 
2400 mg daily) and a range of treatment durations (single dose up to 24 weeks) in 23 completed 
clinical studies. This total includes: 
•  495 transplant recipients with CMV infection treated with maribavir 400 mg BID to 1200 mg 
BID (800 mg/day to 2400 mg /day) for 8 weeks to 24 weeks (Phase 3 study 303 for 8 weeks, 
Phase 2 study 202 for up to 24 weeks, Phase 2 study 203 for up to 12 weeks).  
•  680 patients in three Phase 2 and 3 CMV prevention studies in transplant recipients who 
received maribavir doses of 100 mg BID, 400 mg QD, or 400 mg BID (200 mg/day to 800 
mg/day) for 12 weeks to 24 weeks 
•  380 patients in Phase 1 studies

Patients in the maribavir group were exposed to study-assigned treatment for approximately 50% 
longer than patients in the IAT group: mean (SD) exposure of 52.5 (11.81) days in the maribavir 
group and 36.0 (18.06) days in the IAT group based on the number of days between first and last 
exposure to study-assigned treatment. Exposure based on the number of days actually exposed to 
study-assigned treatment was 50% longer for maribavir than for IAT: mean (SD) exposure of 48.6 
(13.82) days in the maribavir group and 31.2 (16.91) days in the IAT group. This difference in 
exposure should be considered when comparing the incidence of AEs in the 2 treatment groups.

Study 1263-300 
Throughout the full study follow-up period (ie, 12-month database), deaths were reported in 26% 
(59/223) of patients in the placebo group and in 31% (139/451) of patients in the maribavir group. 
The proportion of patients with a treatment-emergent SAE was similar among placebo- and maribavir-
treated patients (44% in both treatment groups). Similar proportions of patients in both treatment 
groups discontinued study drug due to an AE (placebo 19%; maribavir 17%). 
Ninety-six percent (213/223) of placebo-treated patients and 98% (440/451) of maribavir treated 
patients reported a TEAE during the study. The majority of TEAEs were not considered related to study 
drug by the investigator: 93% (1408/1513) in the placebo group and 91% (3169/3469) in the 
maribavir group. In both treatment groups, the majority of TEAEs were of mild or moderate severity 
(82% [1246/1513] in the placebo group and 83% [2894/3469] in the maribavir 100 mg BID group).

The proportion of severe events was 15% (220/1513) in the placebo group versus 13% (450/3469) in 
the maribavir group; the proportion of events of maximal severity was 3% (47/1513) in the placebo 
group versus 4% (125/3469) in the maribavir group. 
Study 1263-301 
This study was stopped early when the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) determined there was an 
imbalance between the maribavir and ganciclovir groups in the incidence of CMV infections during the 
study. 
Deaths were reported in 4% (6/156) of patients in the ganciclovir group and in 6% (9/147) of patients 
in the maribavir group. The proportion of patients with a treatment-emergent SAE was similar among 
ganciclovir- and maribavir-treated patients (49% and 48%, respectively). Study drug was discontinued 
due to an AE in 9% of ganciclovir patients and 18% of maribavir patients (with the difference driven 
largely by higher CMV infection rates in the maribavir group).  
Ninety-seven percent (152/156) of ganciclovir-treated patients and 95% (140/147) of maribavir-
treated patients reported a TEAE during the study. The majority of TEAEs were not considered related 
to maribavir/placebo by the investigator: 91% (1095/1205) in the ganciclovir group and 90% 
(977/1087) in the maribavir group. In both treatment groups, the majority of TEAEs were of mild or 
moderate severity (91% [1098/1205] in the ganciclovir group and 93% [1006/1087] in the maribavir 
group). The proportions of sever events were 8% (97/1205) in the ganciclovir group and 7% 
(74/1087) in the maribavir group; the proportions of events of maximal severity were <1% (10/1205) 
in the ganciclovir group and <1% (7/1087) in the maribavir group. 
Study 1263-200 
Deaths were reported in 21% (6/28) of placebo-treated patients and in 12% (10/82) of maribavir-
treated patients. The proportion of patients with a treatment-emergent SAE was similar among 
placebo- and maribavir-treated patients (43% and 39%, respectively). More patients receiving 
maribavir discontinued study drug due to an adverse event than those receiving placebo (40% and 
21%, respectively). However, it should be noted that the study design called for the discontinuation of 
study drug upon occurrence of CMV infection or disease requiring treatment, and this occurred most 
frequently in the placebo group (54%, 15/28). Had these patients continued study drug, it is possible 
that subsequent AEs might have led to discontinuation within the 12-week evaluation time frame. 
Ninety-nine percent (109/110) of patients reported a TEAE during the study. The majority of adverse 
events were not considered related to study drug by the investigator: 96% (125/130) in the placebo 
group and 88% (426/485) in the combined maribavir groups. Across all treatment groups, the majority 
of TEAEs were of mild or moderate severity: 81% (105/130) in the placebo group, 83% (131/158) in 
the maribavir 100 mg BID group, 84% (145/172) in the maribavir 400 mg QD group, and 79% 
(122/155) in the maribavir 400 mg BID group. 
Phase 1 studies 
In the 14 studies in healthy patients, there were no deaths or SAEs. Three maribavir-treated patients 
and no placebo-treated patients discontinued treatment due to an AE. One subject was discontinued 
due to an AE following dosing with moxifloxacin in a single-dose crossover study. 
The majority of TEAEs that occurred in Phase 1 studies in healthy patients were mild or moderate in 
severity. The most common TEAE in single- and multiple-dose Phase 1 studies in healthy patients was 
dysgeusia. In general, dysgeusia was reported as a bitter or metallic taste and was considered related 
to maribavir administration by the investigators. No patients were withdrawn from treatment because 
of dysgeusia. Dysgeusia usually started within 1 hour after maribavir dosing and resolved within 
approximately 8 hours after dosing in the single-dose studies (range, 0.5 hours to 25 hours) and 
Assessment report

within 1 day after the last dose in the multiple-dose studies. Other frequently occurring TEAEs included 
headache and nausea; these events occurred less frequently than dysgeusia and were also mostly mild 
to moderate in severity. 
In the 3 studies in HIV-infected patients and patients with AIDs, no deaths occurred. There were 5 
patients (3 maribavir-treated and 2 placebo-treated) who experienced SAEs, none of which were 
considered to be related to the study treatment by the investigator. Seven patients discontinued 
treatment due to an AE, with rash being the most frequently occurring AE resulting in discontinuation 
(n=5). The majority of TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. As was found in the Phase 1 studies 
in healthy patients, the most frequently occurring TEAE in patients with HIV infection or AIDS was 
dysgeusia. The characteristics of these events were similar to those described above for healthy 
patients in the Phase 1 studies. Abnormal laboratory findings were generally consistent with those 
expected for patients with AIDS or HIV infection. Results of vital sign measurements and ECGs in these 
patients were generally unremarkable. 
Study 1263-108 (Thorough QT/QTc Study) 
One subject was discontinued from treatment due to an adverse event (upper respiratory tract 
infection) which occurred after receiving moxifloxacin 400 mg. All TEAEs were mild in severity. The 
most frequently reported TEAE was dysgeusia, which was dose related (80% of patients during 
treatment with maribavir 1200 mg, 22% of patients during treatment with maribavir 100 mg, 2% of 
patients during treatment with moxifloxacin, and no placebo-treated patients). The second most 
frequent TEAE was contact dermatitis, reported in 2-12% of patients across the 4 treatments. All of 
these events were attributed to ECG patch application and were considered not related to study drug 
by the investigator. 
Treatment-emergent AEs occurring in 2 or more patients during a given treatment included: nausea 
(10% of maribavir 1200 mg patients, 2% of maribavir 100 mg patients, and no moxifloxacin or 
placebo patients); headache (2% of maribavir 1200 mg patients, 6% of maribavir 100 mg patients, 
and no moxifloxacin or placebo patients); and pharyngolaryngeal pain (4% of maribavir 100 mg 
patients, 2% of moxifloxacin patients, and no maribavir 1200 mg or placebo patients). Other TEAEs 
occurred in 1 subject during a given treatment. There were no clinically meaningful trends noted in 
median change from baseline in vital signs following any of the 4 treatments or across treatments. 
None of the patients had standard 12-lead ECG findings that were considered clinically significant by 
the investigator. No maribavir- or placebo-treated subject had a QTcIb or QTcF >450 msec or 
increases from baseline in these parameters that were >30 msec.

AEs of special interest (AESIs) 
Taste disturbance 
Phase 3 study 303 
Taste disturbance (dysgeusia) as an AESI class occurred more frequently in maribavir-treated patients 
than for patients in the IAT group during the on-treatment observation period (maribavir: 108 [46.2%] 
patients; IAT: 5 [4.3%] patients). Taste disturbance (dysgeusia) was considered related to maribavir 
in 44.0% of patients (1.7% of patients who received IAT), but was Grade 1 or 2 in severity for all 
patients and was not reported as a treatment-emergent SAE for any subject. The most frequently 
reported preferred terms within this AESI class (>1% of patients) were dysgeusia (maribavir: 87 
[37.2%] patients; IAT: 4 [3.4%] patients) and taste disorder (maribavir: 21 [9.0%] patients: IAT: 1 
[0.9%] patient) (Section 14, Table 14.3.1.15.1). Preferred terms within the AESI category of taste 
disturbance (dysgeusia) led to discontinuation of treatment for 2 (0.9%) maribavir treated patients 
and no patients in the IAT group. 
Time to event analyses showed dysgeusia resolved either during treatment with maribavir or shortly 
after discontinuation of treatment. For the 119 patients who had dysgeusia (or similar terms) while on 
maribavir treatment, the event(s) resolved during treatment for 44 (37.0%) patients, with an 
observed median duration of dysgeusia while on treatment of 43 days (range: 7 to 59 days). The 
Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to resolution of dysgeusia while on treatment was 58 days. For the 75 
patients who had dysgeusia (or similar terms) that was ongoing at the time of the last dose of 
maribavir, the event(s) resolved for 67 (89.3%) patients, with an observed median duration of 
dysgeusia off treatment of 6 days. The median Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to resolution of 
dysgeusia following discontinuation of study drug was 7 days (95% CI: 4 to 8 days). 
Assessment report  
EMA/792160/2022 
Page 144/145 
 
 
 
 
 
Phase 2 study 202 
The most frequently reported TEAE associated with maribavir in this study was dysgeusia (taste 
disturbance), with the proportions showing some evidence of dose dependence (60%, 63%, and 73% 
in the maribavir 400 mg BID, 800 mg BID, and 1200 mg BID groups, respectively). Two patients 
reported either ageusia or hypogeusia in addition to dysgeusia. Except for 1 event that was severe, all 
other reports of taste disturbance were of mild to moderate severity. 
The majority of TEAEs of dysgeusia were reported with descriptions that included “metallic taste” or 
“bitter taste.” All events associated with taste disturbance were considered by the investigator to be 
related to maribavir treatment. One patient had maribavir discontinued due to an AE of dysgeusia. 
Three other patients had maribavir treatment interrupted due to dysgeusia. One of these patients 
(1200 mg BID) had a subsequent event of dysgeusia that resulted in maribavir dose adjustment. 
Phase 2 study 203 
Dysgeusia was the most frequently reported TEAE among maribavir-treated patients: 45.0% of 
maribavir 400 mg BID patients, 40.0% of maribavir 800 mg BID patients, and 35.9% of maribavir 
1200 mg BID patients. By comparison, dysgeusia occurred in 1 (2.5%) valganciclovir patient. It is 
noted that the proportion of patients with dysgeusia decreased as maribavir dose increased. Other 
events associated with taste disturbance, including ageusia and hypogeusia, were each reported by 1 
patient (0.8%) in the overall maribavir group compared with no reports in the valganciclovir group. All 
events of taste disturbance were of mild or moderate severity. All events associated with taste 
disturbance were considered by the investigator to be related to maribavir. The event of dysgeusia in 
the valganciclovir-treated patient was not considered to be treatment related.  
The majority of TEAEs of dysgeusia were reported with descriptions that included “metallic taste” or 
“bitter taste.” None of the events associated with taste disturbance led to discontinuation or 
interruption of study drug, and 1 patient (maribavir 800 mg BID) had a taste disturbance event that 
resulted in dose adjustment. 
Nausea/diarrhoea/vomiting 
Phase 3 study 303 
Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea as an AESI class occurred for a similar percentage of patients in the 
maribavir and IAT groups during the on-treatment observation period (maribavir: 78 [33.3%] 
patients; IAT: 44 [37.9%] patients) despite the longer duration of exposure to maribavir. The TEAEs in 
this AESI class were considered related to treatment for 12.8% of patients in the maribavir group and 
11.2% of patients in the IAT group and were reported as SAEs for 2.6% of patients in each treatment 
group. Most patients had TEAEs in the AESI class of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea that were Grade 
1 or 2 in severity; 2.1% of maribavir-treated patients and 3.4% of patients in the IAT group had Grade 
3 TEAEs of nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhoea. One (0.4%) maribavir-treated patient had a Grade 4 
event (diarrhoea), which was the maximum intensity reported. For patients in the IAT group, at least 1 
TEAE mapping to this AESI class occurred across all IAT types: ganciclovir/valganciclovir (33.9%), 
foscarnet (40.4%), and >1 IAT (57.1%).  
Phase 2 study 202 
In the maribavir 400 mg BID group, events of nausea (37.5%), vomiting (27.5%), and diarrhoea 
(12.5%) were frequently reported. There was no evidence that the occurrence of nausea and vomiting 
were related to maribavir dose. Diarrhoea occurred more frequently in the 2 higher maribavir dose 
groups (32.5% of patients in the 800 mg BID group and 25.0% of patients in the 1200 mg BID group). 
The majority of these GI events were of mild or moderate severity. For 9 patients, 1 or more of these 
Assessment report  
EMA/792160/2022 
Page 145/146 
 
 
 
3 GI events were severe (two 400 mg BID patients, two 800 mg BID patients, and five 1200 mg BID 
patients). 
Three patients (2.5%) discontinued from maribavir due to nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhoea, one of 
whom had active nausea at the study start. Nausea led to interruption of maribavir treatment in 4 
patients (3.3%), 3 of whom were receiving the 1200 mg BID dose, and vomiting lead to interruption of 
maribavir treatment in 1 patient who was receiving the 1200 mg BID dose. Gastrointestinal toxicity 
(including reasons specified as nausea or vomiting) accounted for the majority (8 of 15) of dose 
adjustments to maribavir that occurred during the study. 
Phase 2 study 203 
A total of 14 patients (35.0%) who received maribavir 400 mg BID and 10 patients (25.0%) who 
received valganciclovir reported a GI disorders of nausea, diarrhoea, or vomiting. The percentages of 
patients reporting GI events of nausea and diarrhoea were higher in the maribavir 400 mg BID group 
(22.5% and 17.5% for each event, respectively) compared with the valganciclovir group (15% and 
10% for each event, respectively), while similar proportions of patients in the 2 groups (10.0%) 
reported vomiting. There was some evidence that the occurrence of vomiting and diarrhoea was 
related to maribavir dose. Vomiting occurred in 10.0% of patients in the 400 mg BID group, 20.0% of 
patients in the 800 mg BID group, and 30.8% of patients in the 1200 mg BID group (compared with 
10.0% of patients in the valganciclovir group). Diarrhoea occurred in 17.5% of patients in the 400 and 
800 mg BID groups and 25.6% of patients in the 1200 mg BID group (compared with 10.0% of 
patients in the valganciclovir group). The majority of these GI events were of mild or moderate 
severity. 
Study drug discontinuation or interruption due to nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea was rare in all 
treatment groups. While dose adjustment was required infrequently for maribavir patients (10 of 119 
patients [8.4%]), GI toxicity was the most frequently occurring reason for maribavir dose adjustment 
(5 of the 10 patients whose dose was adjusted for toxicity). 
Immunosuppressant drug level increased 
Based on the results from clinical drug interaction study 1263-105, coadministration with maribavir 
may increase the concentration of tacrolimus and other immunosuppressants (eg, cyclosporine, 
everolimus and sirolimus) that have a narrow therapeutic index. 
Phase 3 study 303 
The higher percentage of maribavir-treated patients with immunosuppressant drug concentration level 
increased during the on-treatment observation period compared with patients who received IAT was 
consistent with the known PK effects of maribavir (maribavir: 21 [9.0%] patients; IAT: 1 [0.9%] 
patient). The increased drug level of immunosuppressant was considered related to maribavir for 14 
(6.0%) patients and was reported as a treatment-emergent SAE for 1 (0.4%) maribavir-treated 
patient. 
Phase 2 study 202 
Treatment-emergent AEs of increased immunosuppressant drug levels occurred in 10% (12/120) of 
maribavir-treated patients. Eleven of the 12 patients for whom this TEAE was reported had high to 
toxic levels of tacrolimus and 1 patient (400 mg BID group) had elevated sirolimus levels (refer to the 
Study 202 CSR, Section 10.6). The occurrence of TEAEs of increased immunosuppressant drug levels 
appeared to be dose related, with the highest proportion of patients with increased 
immunosuppressant drug level events in the 1200 mg BID dose group (15.0% of patients), compared 
with 10% of patients in the 400 mg BID dose group and 5% of patients in the 800 mg BID dose group. 
For the majority of patients with increased immunosuppressant drug level events, these events were 
Assessment report  
EMA/792160/2022 
Page 146/147 
 
 
 
mild to moderate in severity; for 3 patients, these events were severe. Maribavir was discontinued for 
1 patient (1200 mg BID) due to acute kidney injury secondary to increased tacrolimus levels. No 
patient had maribavir treatment interrupted due to a TEAE of increased immunosuppressant drug 
levels. 
Phase 2 study 203 
Treatment-emergent increased immunosuppressant drug levels occurred in 5% of patients (n=2) in 
the maribavir 400 and 800 mg BID dose groups and in 15.4% of patients (n=6) in the maribavir 1200 
mg group; no patient in the valganciclovir group was reported to have increased immunosuppressant 
drug levels. Nine of these 10 maribavir-treated patients had high to toxic levels of tacrolimus and 1 
patient had cyclosporine intoxication. It is noted that the highest proportion of patients with increased 
immunosuppressant drug level events occurred in the 1200 mg BID dose group (15.4% of patients). 
For the majority of patients with increased immunosuppressant drug level events, these events were 
mild to moderate in severity; for 2 patients in the 1200 mg BID group, these events were severe. For 
1 of the 10 patients with increased immunosuppressant drug level events, the study drug was 
discontinued due to the AE of worsening cachexia, which was described as the result of clinical 
aggravation due to the rise in tacrolimus levels. Maribavir treatment was interrupted for 1 patient 
(0.8%) who was receiving 800 mg BID due to a TEAE of increased immunosuppressant drug level. 
Rash 
Phase 3 study 303 
Rash as a medical concept was reported more frequently in the maribavir group (7.3%) than in the IAT 
group (2.6%). Rash was mild for all but 3 maribavir-treated patients, and all TEAEs in the medical 
concept of rash were considered by the investigator as not related to treatment with maribavir. There 
were no SAEs of rash reported during the study. 
Phase 2 study 202 
Treatment-emergent rash was reported for 7 (17.5%) maribavir 400 mg BID patients, 6 (15.0%) 800 
mg BID patients, and 3 (7.5%) 1200 mg BID patients. It is noted that the occurrence of rash 
decreased as maribavir dose increased. Eight of the 16 patients had rash that was considered by the 
investigator to be related to maribavir. All events of rash were of mild or moderate severity, and none 
resulted in any patient discontinuing maribavir treatment. Two patients had maribavir temporarily 
interrupted for a mild rash. There were no SAEs of rash reported during the study. 
Phase 2 study 203 
Treatment-emergent rash was reported with similar frequencies across all treatment groups: 2 (5.0%) 
maribavir 400 mg BID patients, 4 (10.0%) maribavir 800 mg patients, 1 (2.6%) maribavir 1200 mg 
patient, and 3 (7.5%) valganciclovir-treated patients. The occurrence of rash did not appear to be 
related to maribavir dose. Two of the 7 maribavir-treated patients had rash that was considered by the 
investigator to be related to the study drug (1 patient each in the 800 and 1200 mg BID groups. Rash 
was not considered related to valganciclovir treatment. All events of rash were of mild or moderate 
severity, and none resulted in discontinuation from the study drug in any treatment group. One patient 
in the maribavir 1200 mg BID group had study drug temporarily interrupted for a mild rash. None of 
the events of rash were reported as SAEs. 
Neutropenia 
Phase 3 study 303 
Assessment report  
EMA/792160/2022 
Page 147/148 
 
 
 
 
Neutropenia as an AESI class was less common for maribavir-treated patients than for IAT during the 
on-treatment observation period (maribavir: 24 [10.3%] patients; IAT: 30 [25.9%] patients). 
Treatment-related neutropenia (as an AESI class) was reported for 1.7% of maribavir-treated patients. 
In contrast, by IAT type, neutropenia as an AESI class occurred for 22 (39.3%) 
ganciclovir/valganciclovir-treated patients (with 32.1% considered treated related) and 8 (17.0%) 
foscarnet-treated patients (with 4.3% considered treatment related). Neutropenia (as an AESI class) 
was reported as a treatment-emergent SAE for 2 (0.9%) maribavir-treated patients (neither 
considered related) compared with 7 (12.5%) ganciclovir/valganciclovir-treated patients (considered 
related for 2 [3.6%] patients). 
Tissue-invasive CMV disease/syndrome 
Phase 3 study 303 
During the on-treatment observation period, TEAEs in the AESI class of tissue-invasive CMV 
disease/syndrome were reported for 3.4% of patients in each treatment group (maribavir: 8; IAT: 4) 
despite the longer duration of exposure to maribavir. Preferred terms for tissue-invasive CMV 
disease/syndrome reported during the on-treatment observation period included the following: 
•  CMV syndrome: maribavir: 3 (1.3%) patients (SAE for 2 [0.9%] patients); IAT: 1 (0.9%) 
patient 
•  CMV chorioretinitis: maribavir: 2 (0.9%) patients (SAEs); IAT: 1 (0.9%) patient (SAE) 
•  CMV colitis: maribavir: 1 (0.4%) patient (SAE); IAT: 1 (0.9%) patient 
•  CMV mucocutaneous ulcer: maribavir: 1 (0.4%) patient (SAE); IAT: 0 patients 
•  CMV GI infection: maribavir: 1 (0.4%) patient; IAT: 0 patients 
•  CMV enteritis: maribavir: 0 patients; IAT: 1 (0.9%) patient 
Tissue-invasive CMV disease/syndrome was considered related to treatment for 1 maribavir-treated 
patient (CMV syndrome). 
Invasive fungal or bacterial or viral infections 
Phase 3 study 303 
A higher proportion of maribavir-treated patients than IAT-treated patients had TEAEs mapping to the 
AESI class of invasive fungal or bacterial or viral infections during the on-treatment observation period 
(maribavir: 55 [23.5%] patients; IAT: 22 [19.0%] patients). This disparity appears to be related to the 
longer duration of exposure to maribavir compared to IAT. The infections were reported as treatment-
emergent SAEs for 23 (9.8%) patients in the maribavir group and 6 (5.2%) patients in the IAT group. 
However, none of the infections (TEAEs or SAEs) in the maribavir group were considered related to 
treatment; whereas, infection was considered related to IAT for 1 patient (encephalitis viral). For the 
IAT group, patients with TEAEs within this AESI class received either ganciclovir/valganciclovir (12.5%) 
or foscarnet (29.8%). One patient received >1 IAT. Infections reported for more patients in the 
maribavir group than in the IAT group included preferred terms of the following: 
• 
Pneumonia (8 vs 2 patients) 
•  BK virus infection (5 vs 4 patients) 
• 
Enterococcal infection and herpes zoster (5 vs 0 patients) 
•  Staphylococcal bacteraemia (4 vs 2 patients)

• 
Encephalitis CMV, enterococcal bacteraemia, and Epstein-Barr virus infection reactivation (3 vs

•  Cystitis viral (3 vs 0 patients) 
•  Aspergillus infection and Epstein-Barr viraemia (2 vs 1 patient) 
• 
Epstein-Barr virus infection, Escherichia sepsis, human polyomavirus infection, pneumocystis 
jirovecii pneumonia, septic shock, Staphylococcal infection, and varicella zoster virus infection 
(2 vs 0 patients) 
Bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, clostridium difficile colitis, clostridium difficile infection, cystitis 
klebsiella, Enterobacter infection, Escherichia bacteraemia, herpes zoster meningoencephalitis, 
meningitis enteroviral, parvovirus B19 infection, pneumonia cryptococcal, pneumonia haemophilus, 
pneumonia mycoplasmal, pseudomonal bacteraemia, pseudomonal sepsis, pulmonary tuberculosis, 
stenotrophomonas infection, systemic candida, and tuberculosis (1 vs 0 patients). 
GVHD 
Phase 3 study 303 
At baseline, the percentage of patients with acute GVHD was numerically higher for patients in the 
maribavir group versus the IAT group (9.8% vs 6.8%). This may have contributed to the difference in 
the incidence rates of acute GVHD between treatment groups during the study. Twenty-one (9.0%) 
maribavir-treated patients had a TEAE of new or worsening GVHD during the on-treatment observation 
period compared with 5 (4.3%) patients in the IAT group. One-third of the maribavir-treated patients 
(7/21 patients) with treatment-emergent GVHD during the on-treatment observation period reported 
acute GVHD at baseline compared with one-fifth (1/5 patients) of the IAT group. 
The GVHD was considered related to study-assigned treatment for 2 (0.9%) patients in the maribavir 
group (preferred terms of GVHD and acute GVHD in intestine) and none in the IAT group. The 
maribavir-treated patient with the TEAE of acute GVHD in intestine that was considered related to 
study-assigned treatment had Grade III GVHD at baseline. 
Graft rejection 
Phase 3 study 303 
Graft rejection as an AESI class occurred for a similar percentage of patients in the maribavir and IAT 
groups during the on-treatment observation period (3.4% and 2.6%, respectively). Transplant 
rejection (type of transplant not specified) occurred for 6 maribavir-treated patients (SAE for 1 patient) 
and 2 patients who received foscarnet. Lung transplant rejection occurred for 1 maribavir-treated 
patient and 1 patient who received foscarnet. Transplant failure (HSCT) occurred for 1 maribavir-
treated patient. None of these TEAEs were considered related to study-assigned treatment.

Phase 2 study 202 
Treatment-emergent SAEs occurred in similar proportions of patients in the 3 dose groups (ie, 65-70% 
of patients). Anaemia was the most frequently occurring SAE in the 400 mg BID group (10% [n=4]); 
anaemia was not reported for patients in the other dose groups. Cytomegalovirus infection was the 
next most frequently occurring SAE in the 400 mg BID group, with the incidence of CMV infection 
increasing with maribavir dose (8%, 13%, and 15% in the 400 mg BID, 800 mg BID, and 1200 mg 
BID groups, respectively). Other SAEs in the 400 mg BID group occurred in 2 or fewer patients. The 
SAEs that occurred in the 800 mg BID and 1200 mg BID groups were similar to those that occurred in 
the 400 mg BID group and occurred with similar frequency. 
Eight patients in the 400 mg BID group (20%), 7 patients in the 800 mg BID group (17.5%), and 5 
patients in the 1200 mg BID group (12.5%) had treatment-emergent SAEs that were considered by 
the investigator to be related to maribavir therapy. Per the study protocol, events of new CMV infection 
or reactivation were to be recorded as an AE or SAE, as appropriate. Treatment-related SAEs of CMV 
infection (new or worsening CMV viraemia) were reported for two 400 mg BID patients and three 800 
mg BID patients. Anaemia (2 patients) was the only other treatment-related SAE reported by 2 
patients in the 400 mg BID group. Treatment-related SAEs in the 800 and 1200 mg BID groups were 
similar in frequency to those occurring in the 400 mg BID group. 
Phase 2 study 203 
The median exposure to maribavir at any dose (43.5 days to 45 days) was longer than the median 
exposure to valganciclovir (30 days). As a result, the proportions of maribavir patients reporting SAEs 
are likely to be higher than the proportions of valganciclovir patients reporting SAEs. Treatment-
emergent SAEs occurred in 40% (n=16) of patients in the maribavir 400 mg BID group and 32.5% 
(n=13) of patients in the valganciclovir group. There was no obvious association with maribavir dose. 
Acute GVHD in the maribavir 1200 mg BID group and bacterial sepsis in the valganciclovir group were 
the only 2 events that occurred in 3 patients; all other SAEs occurred in 2 or fewer patients in each 
treatment group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/792160/2022 
Page 151/152 
 
 
 
 
Treatment-emergent SAEs considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug occurred in 
three maribavir 400 mg BID patients, one maribavir 800 mg BID patients, eight maribavir 1200 mg 
BID patients, and one valganciclovir patient. Per the study protocol, events of new CMV infection or 
reactivation were to be recorded as an AE or SAE, as appropriate. Three cases of CMV reactivation 
were classified as treatment-related SAEs; this event was reported by 1 patient each from the 
maribavir 400 mg BID, maribavir 800 mg BID, and valganciclovir groups. Diarrhoea was the only 
treatment-related SAE that occurred in 2 patients in a particular treatment group (maribavir 1200 mg 
BID); all other treatment-related SAEs occurred in 1 patient in each treatment group. 
Deaths 
Phase 3 study 303 
A total of 40 patient deaths were reported for this study. This included 2 patients in the maribavir 
group who died within the first week of treatment (i.e, before receiving a sufficient course of therapy) 
as well as 4 patients (2 in each treatment group) who died more than 20 weeks after the first dose of 
study-assigned treatment (i.e, after the 20-week study observation period). These 4 late-occurring 
deaths were captured because they were associated with SAEs that were ongoing when the patients 
concluded participation in the study. 
With respect to the onset of SAEs that resulted in death: 
•  38/350 (10.9%) patients experienced fatal SAEs with onset in the overall study observation 
period (i.e, on-treatment or during post-treatment follow-up): 26 (11.1)% in the maribavir 
group and 12 (10.3%) patients in the IAT group. Most SAE preferred terms leading to death 
were reported for 1 patient each. The most common SAEs leading to death were due to 
respiratory failure or relapse or progression of underlying disease. 
•  22/350 (6.3%) patients had fatal treatment-emergent SAEs with onset during the on-
treatment observation period: 16 (6.8%) patients in the maribavir group and 6 (5.2%) 
patients in the IAT group. There was no consistent pattern of fatal treatment-emergent SAEs 
within or between treatment groups. The only fatal treatment-emergent SAEs reported for 
more than 1 patient in the on-treatment observation period were as follows: 
-  Respiratory failure (maribavir: 2 patients; IAT: 1 patient [foscarnet]), 
-  Acute myeloid leukaemia (recurrent) (maribavir: 1 patient; IAT:1 patient [foscarnet]) 
- 
Leukaemia (recurrent) (maribavir: 1 patient; IAT: 1 patient [ganciclovir/valganciclovir]) 
• 
Fatal treatment-emergent SAEs due to CMV infection of any type during the on-treatment 
observation period were reported for 2 (0.9%) maribavir-treated patients (CMV colitis and CMV 
syndrome) and 1 (0.9%) patient in the IAT group who received foscarnet (CMV encephalitis). 
•  16/350 (4.6%) patients had fatal SAEs with onset >7 days after the last dose (ie, during the 
follow-up period): 10 (4.3%) patients in the maribavir group and 6 (5.2%) patients in the IAT 
group. These post-treatment fatal SAEs are consistent with progression of disease in the 
population under study. Fatal SAEs due to CMV infection of any type in the post-treatment 
period were reported for 2 (0.9%) maribavir treated patients (CMV encephalitis for both 
patients) and 2 (1.7%) patients in the IAT group (CMV pneumonia and CMV enterocolitis). 
•  1/22 (4.5%) patients who received maribavir as rescue therapy after failing IAT had a fatal 
treatment-emergent SAE in the maribavir rescue period. 
•  1/234 (0.4%) patients died after receiving maribavir, however the onset of the fatal adverse 
event was prior to the first dose (recurrence of Hodgkin’s disease, classified as severe in 
Assessment report  
EMA/792160/2022 
Page 152/153 
 
 
 
intensity, 3 days before taking the first dose of maribavir). This patient died approximately 3 
months after initiating maribavir (cause of death: relapse Hodgkin’s disease). 
Fatal treatment-emergent SAEs were considered related to study-assigned treatment for 1 (0.4%) 
maribavir-treated patient (drug-drug interaction with outcome of sudden death on day 7, treatment 
with maribavir until day 4, concomitant medication voriconazole followed by posaconazole (for upper 
respiratory tract infection with Aspergillus) and domperidone (for anorexia), no autopsy, no additional 
laboratory, physical exam, ECG, or radiographic information was available beyond the baseline study 
visit, the Sponsor disagrees with the investigator’s assessment and considers that while there was 
potential for drug-drug interactions resulting in fatal arrhythmia, those interactions do not reasonably 
include the investigational product (maribavir), rather, the most likely agents involved were 
domperidone (for anorexia) and posaconazole) and 1 (0.9%) IAT-treated patient (febrile neutropenia, 
pneumonia, and tuberculosis). 
Phase 2 study 202 
A total of 32 deaths were reported in this study: 10 (25%), 12 (30%), and 10 (25%) patients died in 
the 400 mg BID, 800 mg BID, and 1200 mg BID groups, respectively. No particular AE (i.e, preferred 
term) resulted in more than 2 deaths in any treatment group. 
One death due to multi-organ failure in the 800 mg BID group was considered by the investigator to be 
possibly related to maribavir therapy (medical history significant for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, chronic 
renal failure, and graft pancreatitis after receiving a pancreas transplant). 
Phase 2 study 203 
A total of 9 patients died in this study: 2 (5%), 1 (2.5%), and 3 (7.7%) patients died in the maribavir 
400 mg BID, 800 mg BID, and 1200 mg BID groups, respectively, and 3 (7.5%) patients in the 
valganciclovir 900 mg BID group. No particular AE (i.e, preferred term) resulted in more than 1 deaths 
in any treatment group. None of the SAEs resulting in death were considered to be treatment related. 
2.6.8.3.  Laboratory findings 
Overall, a similar percentage of patients in the maribavir and IAT groups of the Phase 3 study 303 had 
a shift in creatinine to NCI CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 at the last on-study assessment and at the last on-
study observation. However, shifts in creatinine to Grade 3 or 4 in the IAT group occurred exclusively 
in foscarnet-treated patients. The median time to first maximum post baseline NCI CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 
increase in creatinine during the on-treatment observation period was similar in both treatment groups 
(maribavir: 20.5 days [range: 14 to 58 days]; IAT: 22.5 days [range: 14 to 31 days]).  
Median change from baseline in liver function parameters, cholesterol, triglycerides, albumin, glucose, 
and creatine kinase were minimal at the last on-treatment assessment and the last on-study 
observation. At the last on-treatment assessment, shifts from a lower NCI CTCAE grade to Grade 3 or 
4 occurred for >2% of maribavir-treated patients for increases in GGT (maribavir: 10.4%; IAT: 8.8%), 
glucose (maribavir: 4.4%; IAT: 0%), ALT (maribavir: 3.2%; IAT: 0%), triglycerides (maribavir: 4.1%; 
IAT: 1.0%), and total bilirubin (maribavir: 2.3%; IAT: 1.0%). Shifts from a lower NCI CTCAE Grade to 
Grade 3 or 4 for other liver function parameters, cholesterol, albumin, and creatine kinase occurred 
infrequently during the on-treatment observation period and the overall study period.

2.6.8.4.  Safety in special populations 
Age, Sex, and Race 
The incidence and types of TEAEs commonly reported during the on-treatment observation period of 
the Phase 3 study 303 were generally similar regardless of age, sex, or race. 
The analysis based on age was performed by age categories of 18 to 44 years, 45 to 64 years, and ≥65 
years in Study 303. In the 18 to 44 age group treated with maribavir, at least 1 TEAE was reported for 
96.4% (53/55) patients. Similarly, in the 45 to 64 age group treated with maribavir, 96.8% (121/125) 
patients had at least 1 TEAE and 100% (54/54) of patients in the ≥65 age group treated with maribavir 
had at least 1 TEAE. In all age groups, dysgeusia was the most commonly reported TEAE and occurred 
with similar frequency (34.5% in the 18 to 44 age group, 39.2% in the 45 to 64 age group, and 35.2% 
in the ≥65 age group). 
Of the 147 males in the maribavir group, 96.6% had at least 1 TEAE compared to 98.9% (86/87) 
females in the maribavir group. For both sexes, dysgeusia was the most commonly reported TEAE 
(40.8% in males and 31.0% in females). 
In the table below AEs reported in Phase 3 Study 303 are summarised.

The subgroups based on race comprised White, Black/African American, Asian, and others. Since 
meaningful interpretation of the results for the Asian and other populations was limited by the small 
number of patients, these results are not presented. In the subgroup of White patients who received 
maribavir, 98.3% (175/178) of patients had at least 1 TEAE, which was similar to that reported for 
Black/African American patients (93.1%, 27/29). 
Renally Impaired Patients 
The pharmacokinetics of maribavir following a single 400 mg dose have been characterised in patients 
with varying degrees of renal impairment: mild (creatinine clearance [CrCl] 50 mL/minute to 80 
mL/minute); moderate (CrCl 30 mL/minute to <50 mL/minute); and severe (CrCl <30 mL/minute), 
and compared with patients of similar age, weight, and sex with normal renal function (i.e, CrCl >80 
mL/minute) (Study 1263-101). 
Mean PK parameter estimates based on total or unbound plasma maribavir concentrations for patients 
with normal renal function (creatinine clearance >80 mL/min), mild/moderate renal impairment, and 
severe renal impairment were similar. Mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment does not affect the 
PK of maribavir. Because maribavir has demonstrated time-independent PK, the results from this 
single-dose renal impairment study are applicable to multiple BID doses of maribavir. 
Maribavir has not been studied in patients with end-stage renal disease (CrCl less than 10 mL/min), 
including patients on dialysis.

Page 156/157 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatically Impaired Patients 
Even though maribavir is primarily eliminated by hepatic metabolism, no clinically significant effect of 
moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B score of 7-9) was observed on total or unbound 
maribavir PK parameters following a single dose 200 mg of maribavir. Compared to the healthy control 
patients, AUC0-∞ and Cmax were 26% and 35% higher, respectively, for maribavir, in patients with 
moderate hepatic impairment. The trend observed with the unbound maribavir PK parameters was 
consistent with that observed with the total PK parameters, though the extend was less. Because 
exposure to maribavir was approximately dose proportional following a single dose from 50 to 1600 
mg and following multiple doses up to 2400 mg per day and maribavir has demonstrated time-
independent PK, the results from this single-dose hepatic impairment study are applicable to multiple 
BID doses of maribavir. 
The modest increase in maribavir exposure in patients with moderate hepatic impairment is not 
considered clinically significant, therefore, no dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild or 
moderate hepatic impairment. Maribavir has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment.

No specific information is provided for immunological events. For cases of GVHD and graft rejection, 
please see section AESIs.

Regarding cases of immunosuppressant drug level increased, please see section AESIs. 
2.6.8.7.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Phase 3 study 303 
During the on-treatment observation period, TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study-assigned 
treatment were reported for a greater proportion of patients in the IAT group (31.9%) than in the 
maribavir group (13.2%). Treatment discontinuation due to TEAEs by IAT type was 32.1% for 
ganciclovir/valganciclovir, 36.2% for foscarnet, and 33.3% for cidofovir. 
Phase 2 study 202 
In Phase 2 study 202, 34% of patients were discontinued from maribavir due to an AE. The highest 
rate of discontinuation occurred in the 800 mg BID group (43%), with generally comparable rates 
occurring in the 400 mg BID (28%) and 1200 mg BID (33%) groups. 
Phase 2 study 203 
In Phase 2 study 203, 30% (n=12) of patients in the maribavir 400 mg BID group had TEAEs that led 
to discontinuation of study drug, compared with 12.5% (n=5) of valganciclovir patients. The 
proportions of TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation were not related to maribavir dose.

2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety Database 
The clinical safety database includes data from two Phase 2 and one Phase 3 studies of maribavir as a 
CMV treatment in transplant recipients, three Phase 2 and 3 studies of maribavir for CMV prevention in 
transplant recipients, 17 Phase 1 studies, and 1 taste assessment study. 
The results from pivotal study 303 are regarded as primary safety data. Data from Phase 2 and Phase 
1 studies were not integrated into safety analysis due to the differences in patient populations and/or 
study designs as well as differences in dosages and treatment duration across the studies, which is 
agreed. 
The overall safety population consists of 1,555 patients which have been exposed to maribavir across a 
broad range of doses (50 mg to 2400 mg daily) and a range of treatment durations (single dose up to 
24 weeks) in 23 completed clinical studies. Overall, 495 transplant recipients with CMV infection were 
treated with maribavir 400 mg BID to 1200 mg BID (800 mg/day to 2400 mg /day) for 8 weeks to 24 
weeks. Of these, 234 patients received maribavir 400 mg BID for up to 8 weeks in Phase 3 study 303. 
In Phase 2 study 202, 40 patients were treated with maribavir 400 mg BID for up to 24 weeks and in 
Phase 2 study 203, 40 patients received maribavir 400 mg BID for up to 12 weeks. Overall, the size of 
the safety database is considered acceptable. 
It is notable that the assessment and isolation of the adverse effects profile of maribavir in -303 study 
is hampered by the open-label design and by the heterogeneity of IAT agents in the comparator arm, 
each of which has a complicated side effects profile, including haematological and renal events; the 
same goes for valganciclovir in the -203 study. Furthermore, the background disease is different in 
patients post SOT and post HSCT. 
Adverse events 
Phase 3 study 303 
During the on-treatment observation period of the Phase 3 study 303, 97.4% of the patients in the 
maribavir group and 91.4% of the patients in the IAT group had at least one TEAE. The high incidence 
of TEAEs in both treatment groups is in accordance with the expected rate in a post-transplant 
population. The higher incidence in the maribavir group could be explained by the longer treatment 
period. When comparing the overall study observation period the rate of TEAEs in the maribavir group 
and IAT group is 99.1% and 96.6%, respectively.  
The most frequently reported TEAE during the Phase 3 study 303 was dysgeusia, which occurred 
predominantly in maribavir-treated patients (maribavir: 37.2%; IAT: 3.4%).  
Maribavir (400 mg BID) was shown to increase the whole blood trough concentration of tacrolimus by 
57% in a clinical drug interaction study. Accordingly, drug levels of immunosuppressants were 
monitored during Phase 3 study 303. As expected, the TEAE of immunosuppressant drug level 
increased was reported in a higher proportion of patients in the maribavir group (9.0%) compared to 
the IAT group (0.9%). 
Neutropenia was the most frequently reported TEAE in the IAT group during the on-treatment 
observation period. It occurred at a lower incidence for maribavir-treated patients than for IAT (9.4% 
vs 22.4%). In line with the known safety profile, neutropenia occurred predominantly in patients who 
received ganciclovir/valganciclovir (33.9%). Febrile neutropenia (0.9% and 7.1%), leukopenia (3.0% 
and 12.5%), and thrombocytopenia (4.7% and 8.9%) occurred less frequently in maribavir-treated 
patients than in ganciclovir/valganciclovir-treated patients.  
Assessment report  
EMA/792160/2022 
Page 158/159 
 
 
 
The incidence of anaemia was 12.4% for maribavir-treated patients, 12.1% for IAT overall, 7.1% for 
ganciclovir/valganciclovir-treated patients, and 19.1% for foscarnet-treated patients. The proportion of 
patients with anaemia considered related to treatment was lower for maribavir-treated patients than 
for patients who received either ganciclovir/valganciclovir or foscarnet (maribavir: 1.3%; IAT: 7.8%; 
ganciclovir/valganciclovir: 5.4%; foscarnet: 12.8%). According to the non-clinical safety considerations 
in pivotal repeat-dose oral toxicity studies in rats (6 months) and monkeys (12 months), one of the 
major findings was reversible regenerative anaemia. Therefore, the Applicant was requested to present 
an in-depth analysis of cases with anaemia observed during treatment with maribavir 400 mg BID 
(from Phase 3 study 303 and from Phase 2 studies 202 and 203). Overall, no clear relationship 
between treatment with maribavir and the event of anaemia can be concluded based on the analysis 
provided. In all reported cases alternative aetiology of anaemia including patient’s medical history and 
concomitant use of medications with known adverse reaction of anaemia was present. Nevertheless, 
the issue should be closely evaluated in the upcoming PSURs. 
Maribavir-treated patients had a lower incidence of TEAEs than foscarnet-treated patients for the 
TEAEs frequently reported in foscarnet-treated patients: acute kidney injury (8.5% and 21.3%), 
hypokalaemia (3.4% and 19.1%), headache (8.1% and 17.0%), hypomagnesaemia (3.8% and 
14.9%), hypertension (3.8% and 12.8%), peripheral oedema (7.3% and 10.6%), hypophosphataemia 
(1.7% and 10.6%), and paraesthesia (1.7% and 10.6%). 
The following TEAEs were more frequently reported in maribavir-treated patients compared to IAT 
group: abdominal pain (7.7% vs. 2.6%), arthralgia (5.6% vs. 2.6%), dizziness (7.3% vs. 4.3%), 
mental status changes (2.6% vs. 0.9%). Therefore, the Applicant was requested to provide more 
information about the cases with abdominal pain, arthralgia, dizziness and mental status changes after 
treatment with maribavir. Overall, all reported cases had alternative etiologies that may have been 
attributed to the event such as medical history, concurrent AEs and concomitant medications where 
these events are known adverse reactions. No clear signal could be identified based on these cases. 
Nevertheless, upper abdominal pain is suggested for inclusion in section 4.8 of the SmPC, which is 
agreed. 
Treatment-related TEAEs occurred in a higher proportion of maribavir-treated patients than in patients 
who received IAT (maribavir: 60.3%; IAT: 49.1%) during the on-treatment observation period. This 
observed difference was driven largely by reports of the TEAE of dysgeusia. 
The Applicant provided an overview of TEAEs considered related to study-assigned treatment occurring 
in more than one patient during the on-treatment observation period of the Phase 3 study 303. 
Overall, TEAEs considered related to study-assigned treatment in the SOCs Blood and lymphatic 
system disorders, General disorders and administration site conditions, Metabolism and nutrition 
disorders and Renal and urinary disorders were less commonly reported in the maribavir group 
compared to IAT group. In particular, cases of anaemia (1.3% vs. 7.8%), neutropenia (1.7% vs. 
13.8%), thrombocytopenia (0% vs. 5.2%) and acute kidney injury (1.7% vs. 7.8%) considered related 
to treatment were less reported after treatment with maribavir compared to IAT. In contrast, more 
TEAEs considered related to study-assigned treatment were detectable in the maribavir group in the 
SOC Nervous system disorders, which is driven by cases with dysgeusia (35.9% vs. 0.9%) and the 
SOC infections and infestations (5.1% vs. 2.6), which is driven by cases of CMV infection (0.9%, 0%) 
and viraemia (3.8%, 0.9%). Furthermore, cases of immunosuppressant drug level increased were 
reported more frequently in the maribavir group (6.0 vs. 0%). 
The rate of deaths in the Phase 3 study 303 (maribavir group 11.5%, IAT group 11.2%) was 
comparable between treatment groups. 
The safety profile of maribavir in the phase II studies was consistent with that in study 303. 
Assessment report  
EMA/792160/2022 
Page 159/160 
 
 
 
Due to the open label design there is potential bias, as known adverse reactions of the comparator 
treatment are reported as related to IAT regardless of other possible causes, whereas TEAEs after 
treatment with maribavir could have been reported more reservedly as related to treatment. This was 
also highlighted by the EMA GCP inspectors during the GCP inspection.  
Overall, the safety profile of maribavir is more favourable than that of alternative treatments. 
AEs of special interest (AESIs) 
Taste disturbance 
Taste disturbance events, including dysgeusia occurred in approximately half of patients receiving 400 
mg BID in the 3 clinical studies (Phase 3 study 303: 46.2%, Phase 2 study 202: 60% (dysgeusia), 
Phase 2 study 203: 45% (dysgeusia)). Most events were mild to moderate in severity and occurred 
early upon initiation of treatment. As described for Phase 2 studies 202 and 203, the majority of TEAEs 
of dysgeusia were reported as “metallic taste” or “bitter taste”. While some evidence of dose 
dependence was observed in Phase 2 study 202 (60%, 63%, and 73% in the maribavir 400 mg BID, 
800 mg BID, and 1200 mg BID groups), the proportion of patients with dysgeusia decreased as 
maribavir dose increased in Phase 2 study 203 (45.0%, 40.0%, and 35.9% in the maribavir 400 mg 
BID, 800 mg BID, and 1200 mg BID groups). Most events associated with taste disturbance were 
considered by the investigator to be related to maribavir. Dysgeusia led to treatment discontinuation 
for 2 (0.9%) patients in Phase 3 study 303 and 1 patient in Phase 2 study 202 (maribavir 1200 mg 
BID). No patients in Phase 2 study 203 discontinued because of events of dysgeusia. The Applicant 
analysed if cases of dysgeusia reported in Phase 3 study 303 and in Phase 2 studies 202 and 203 were 
related to any changes in vital signs, body weight or caloric intake. Overall, cases of dysgeusia 
reported in Phase 3 Study 303 and in Phase 2 studies 202 and 203 were not related to changes in vital 
signs and body weight. Data on caloric intake were not collected in Phase 3 and 2 Studies. 
For Phase 3 study 303 time to event analyses were performed. From the 119 patients who had 
dysgeusia (or similar terms) while on maribavir treatment, the event(s) resolved during treatment for 
44 (37.0%) patients, with an observed median duration of dysgeusia while on treatment of 43 days 
(range: 7 to 59 days). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to resolution of dysgeusia while on treatment 
was 58 days. From the 75 patients who had dysgeusia (or similar terms) that was ongoing at the time 
of the last dose of maribavir, the event(s) resolved for 67 (89.3%) patients, with an observed median 
duration of dysgeusia off treatment of 6 days. The median Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to resolution 
of dysgeusia following discontinuation of study drug was 7 days (95% CI: 4 to 8 days). According to 
the analyses provided, in 63% of the reported cases dysgeusia (or similar terms) was detectable until 
the end of treatment with maribavir. Of these, in 89.3% the event(s) of dysgeusia resolved. Overall, of 
the 119 patients who had dysgeusia (or similar terms) while on maribavir treatment, in 111 patients 
(93.3%) the symptoms of taste disturbance resolved during or the days after treatment. In 8 patients 
(10.7%) the symptoms remained. The Applicant further clarified that only 4 events were indeed 
ongoing at the end of the study. Of the 8 events one event of taste disturbance is considered as not 
applicable. In this case, the subject had a prior history of dysgeusia and this event occurred 30 days 
after the treatment was ended. For 3 events, the outcome could not be assessed because the subjects 
had a fatal outcome. In the remaining 4 cases reported as not recovered subjects were receiving other 
concomitant medications such as valganciclovir and amlodipine, which are known to be associated with 
dysgeusia.  
Nausea/diarrhoea/vomiting 
In nonclinical investigations histologic change of mucosal cell hyperplasia in the intestinal tract 
associated with clinical observations of soft to liquid stool, electrolyte changes and dehydration was

observed. In Phase 3 study 303 the incidence of diarrhoea was comparable between maribavir group 
and IAT group (18.8% vs. 20.7%). Most of these patients had diarrhoea that were Grade 1 or 2 in 
severity. One (0.4%) maribavir-treated patient had a Grade 4 event of diarrhoea. In 3.8% of patients 
the event of diarrhoea was considered related to study-assigned treatment (IAT group 5.2%). In Phase 
2 study diarrhoea occurred in 12.5% of the patients in the maribavir 400 mg BID group. Diarrhoea 
occurred more frequently in the 2 higher maribavir dose groups (32.5% of patients in the 800 mg BID 
group and 25.0% of patients in the 1200 mg BID group). In line with this, in Phase 2 study 203 the 
rate of diarrhoea increased with higher maribavir doses (17.5% of patients in the 400 mg and 800 mg 
BID groups and 25.6% of patients in the 1200 mg BID group (compared with 10.0% of patients in the 
valganciclovir group). 
Diarrhoea was included as an adverse reaction with a frequency of very common in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC, which is supported. Furthermore, the Applicant analysed shifts from normal values of 
electrolytes in patients with diarrhoea during treatment with maribavir 400 mg BID reported in Phase 3 
Study 303 and Phase 2 studies 202 and 203. In addition, shifts from normal values of electrolytes in 
patients with diarrhoea in the IAT group were provided and compared to results for maribavir. Overall, 
no significant differences between maribavir and comparator groups could be identified. 
Nausea (maribavir: 50 (21.4%) patients; IAT: 25 (21.6%) patients) and vomiting (maribavir: 33 
(14.1%) patients; IAT: 19 (16.4%) patients) were reported for a similar percentage of patients in the 
maribavir and IAT group in Phase 3 study 303. Most reported TEAEs were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. 
Cases of nausea and vomiting were considered related to study-assigned treatment in 8.5% and 7.7% 
of maribavir treated patients. In Phase 2 study 202, 37.5% and 27.5% of patients in the maribavir 400 
mg BID group reported events of nausea and vomiting. In Phase 2 study 203, the percentage of 
patients reporting events of nausea was higher in the maribavir 400 mg BID group (22.5%) compared 
with the valganciclovir group (15%), while similar proportions of patients in the 2 groups (10.0%) 
reported vomiting. Overall, there was no evidence that the occurrence of nausea and vomiting was 
related to maribavir dose.  
Immunosuppressant drug level increased 
During Phase 3 study 303 a higher rate of immunosuppressant drug concentration level increased was 
reported in maribavir-treated patients (9.0%) compared to patients treated with IAT (0.9%). In 6% of 
patients increased drug level of immunosuppressant was considered related to maribavir. In one 
patient the increased drug level of immunosuppressant was reported as a TESAE.  
The rates of immunosuppressant drug concentration level increased were in general comparable in 
Phase 2 studies 202 and 203. The occurrence of TEAEs of increased immunosuppressant drug levels 
appeared to be dose related, with the highest proportion of patients with increased 
immunosuppressant drug level events in the 1200 mg BID dose groups (Phase 2 study 202 15%, 
Phase 2 study 203 15.4%). 
The Applicant was requested to further analyse if immunosuppressant drug concentration level 
increased in maribavir 400 mg BID treated patients resulted in a reporting of adverse events related to 
the immunosuppressant drug (including cases of graft rejection). As expected, in a part of the patients 
with immunosuppressant drug concentration level increased additional TEAEs were reported that could 
be related to the increased immunosuppressant drug level, such as cases of acute kidney injury and 
blood creatinine increased. Furthermore, one case of worsening of graft vs host disease is described.  
The Applicant included a warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC in addition to the information in section 
4.5 to inform about the risk of immunosuppressant drug concentration level increased, which is 
supported taking into account that immunosuppressants are given frequently in the target population. 
Furthermore, immunosuppressant drug level increased was defined as important identified risks in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/792160/2022 
Page 161/162 
 
 
 
RMP. Further evaluation is suggested in the context of an ongoing study (SHP-620-302) and post-
marketing by means of follow-up questionnaire. As sufficient scientific evidence is recognised for the 
increase in immunosuppressant levels, but there is currently insufficient evidence for the risk of 
increased SAEs due to increased immunosuppressant levels, this risk is renamed to “Increased risk of 
serious adverse reactions due to an increase in immunosuppressant drug level” and included as 
important potential risk in the RMP. 
Rash 
In the Phase 3 study 303 AEs related to rash were reported more frequently in the maribavir group 
(7.3%) than in the IAT group (2.6%). However, none of these events were considered as related to 
treatment with maribavir. In the Phase 2 study 202 TEAE related to rash was reported for 7 (17.5%) 
maribavir 400 mg BID patients, 6 (15.0%) 800 mg BID patients, and 3 (7.5%) 1200 mg BID patients. 
In 8 of the 16 patients the event of rash was considered to be related to maribavir. In Phase 2 study 
203 TEAE related to rash was reported in 2 (5.0%) maribavir 400 mg BID treated patients, 4 (10.0%) 
maribavir 800 mg treated patients, 1 (2.6%) maribavir 1200 mg treated patient, and 3 (7.5%) 
valganciclovir-treated patients. In none of the maribavir 400 mg BID treated patients the TEAE related 
to rash was considered related to maribavir. Overall, TEAEs related to rash were of mild or moderate 
severity and no treatment discontinuations were described. 
Neutropenia 
Neutropenia occurred less common in maribavir-treated patients than in IAT group during Phase 3 
study 303 (maribavir: 24 [10.3%] patients; IAT: 30 [25.9%] patients - ganciclovir/valganciclovir-
treated patients: 22 [39.3%], foscarnet-treated patients: 8 [17.0%]). In 32.1% of patients treated 
with ganciclovir/valganciclovir the event of neutropenia was considered related to treatment, whereas 
the rate of treatment related events of neutropenia was 4.3% in foscarnet-treated patients and 1.7% 
in maribavir-treated patients. 
Neutropenia is a known very common side effect of ganciclovir/valganciclovir. Furthermore, 
neutropenia is labelled as an adverse reaction in section 4.8 of the SmPC of foscarnet with frequency 
common. Overall, regarding the risk of neutropenia there seems to be a significant advantage of 
maribavir over ganciclovir/valganciclovir as well as an advantage over foscarnet.  
Tissue-invasive CMV disease/syndrome 
In the Phase 3 study 303 TEAEs in the AESI class of tissue-invasive CMV disease/syndrome were 
reported for 3.4% of patients in each treatment group. Overall, no safety signal could be identified 
based on the data presented. 
Invasive fungal or bacterial or viral infections 
In Phase 3 study 303 (on-treatment period) a higher proportion of maribavir-treated patients had 
TEAEs related to invasive fungal or bacterial or viral infections compared to IAT-treated patients 
(23.5% vs. 19.0%). Furthermore, in 9.8% of patients in the maribavir group and 5.2% of patients in 
the IAT group the infections were reported as TESAEs. However, none of the infections in the maribavir 
group were considered related to treatment. The applicant justifies the higher rates of maribavir with 
the longer duration of exposure to maribavir compared to IAT which is acceptable taking the high risk 
of infections in the target population into account. 
GVHD 
In the Phase 3 study 303, at baseline, the rate of patients with acute GVHD was numerically higher for 
patients in the maribavir group versus the IAT group (9.8% vs 6.8%). This could be a reason why the 
rate of a TEAE of new or worsening GVHD during the on-treatment observation period was higher in 
Assessment report  
EMA/792160/2022 
Page 162/163 
 
 
 
maribavir-treated patients (9.0%) compared to patients in the IAT group (4.3%). When comparing 
TEAEs of a new onset of treatment-emergent GVHD the difference between treatment groups is less 
pronounced (6% vs. 3.4%).  
Two cases of GVHD reported during Phase 3 Study 303 were considered related to treatment with 
maribavir. One of these patients with a nonserious AE of GVHD in the intestine had a GVHD at 
baseline, the other patient experienced a non-serious AE of graft versus host disease, which was 
reported as “cutaneous GVHD”. No safety signal could be identified based on these single cases. 
Graft rejection   
In the Phase 3 study 303 the rate of graft rejection was comparable between treatment groups 
(maribavir 3.4%, IAT 2.6%). None of these TEAEs were considered related to study-assigned 
treatment. 
Serious adverse events 
Phase 3 study 303 
The rate of reported treatment-emergent SAEs was similar in the maribavir and IAT groups during the 
Phase 3 study 303 (38.5% vs. 37.1%). As expected in a post-transplant population, most SAEs were 
detectable in the infections and infestations SOC. For the assessment of these cases, please see 
section AESIs above. 
Overall, more cases of SAEs neutropenia were reported in the IAT group compared to the maribavir 
group (3 [2.6%] vs. 0). Regarding other SAEs no differences between treatment groups could be 
identified. 
Treatment-emergent SAEs considered related to study-assigned treatment were reported less 
frequently in the maribavir group than in the IAT group (5.1% and 14.7%) which was partly caused by 
more cases of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia in the IAT group. 
Phase 2 study 202 
In the maribavir 400 mg BID group of the Phase 2 study 202 the rate of patients with TESAEs were 
higher compared to the rate in the Phase 3 study 303 (70% vs. 38.5%). Anaemia was the most 
frequently occurring SAE in the 400 mg BID group (10% [n=4]). Except reported cases of 
cytomegalovirus infection (8%), other SAEs occurred in the 400 mg BID group in 2 or fewer patients. 
In the 400 mg BID group 8 patients (20%) had treatment-emergent SAEs that were considered to be 
related to maribavir therapy. No safety signal could be identified based on these cases. 
Phase 2 study 203 
In the Phase 2 study 203 in 40% of patients in the maribavir 400 mg BID group and 32.5% in the 
valganciclovir group SAEs were reported. The difference was justified by the longer treatment duration 
of maribavir compared to valganciclovir. All SAEs in the maribavir 400 mg BID group occurred in 2 or 
less cases. SAEs considered related to the study drug were reported in 3 maribavir 400 mg BID 
patients. No safety signal could be identified based on these cases. 
Deaths 
Phase 3 study 303 
In the Phase 3 study 303 the rate of deaths (maribavir group 11.5%, IAT group 11.2%) as well as the 
timing of deaths were comparable between treatment groups. The only fatal TESAEs reported for more 
than 1 patient were respiratory failure (maribavir: 2 patients; IAT: 1 patient), acute myeloid leukaemia 
(recurrent) (maribavir: 1 patient; IAT:1 patient) and leukaemia (recurrent) (maribavir: 1 patient; IAT: 
Assessment report  
EMA/792160/2022 
Page 163/164 
 
 
 
1 patient). The reported post-treatment fatal SAEs were consistent with progression of disease in the 
population under study. Overall, no safety signal could be identified based on the information of death 
cases provided. 
In 1 (0.4%) maribavir-treated patient and 1 (0.9%) valganciclovir-treated patient (febrile neutropenia 
and resulting pneumonia and tuberculosis) fatal treatment-emergent SAEs were considered related to 
study-assigned treatment. In the maribavir group 1 case of sudden death was reported . Maribavir was 
administered for at least 4 days. However, on day 7 the patient was found dead at home. The 
investigator interpreted this event as sudden cardiac death due to arrhythmia, and reported it as 
related to maribavir based on the possibility of drug-drug interaction, with posaconazole cited as the 
particular agent of concern causing the arrhythmia. The Applicant stated that while there was potential 
for drug-drug interactions resulting in fatal arrhythmia, those interactions do not reasonably include 
the investigational product (maribavir). Rather, the most likely agents involved were domperidone (for 
anorexia) and posaconazole, both started during hospitalisation and continued at discharge. This is 
supported by the information in the product information of domperidone where it is stated that 
domperidone is associated with QTc prolongation and increased risk of sudden cardiac death and that 
concurrent use of domperidone with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as posaconazole) is 
contraindicated. Overall, the argumentation of the Applicant is agreed and the concomitant 
administration of domperidone and posaconazole represents the more likely cause of sudden death. 
Phase 2 study 202 
In 25% of patients in the maribavir 400 mg BID group death was reported. The higher rate compared 
to Phase 3 study 303 could be explained by the longer study period. Overall, no particular AE resulted 
in more than 2 deaths. In one patient in the 800 mg BID group the death due to multi-organ failure 
was considered to be possibly related to maribavir therapy. However, due to pronounced medical 
history (non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, chronic renal failure, and graft pancreatitis after receiving a 
pancreas transplant) no further conclusion is possible based on this case. 
Phase 2 study 203 
In the Phase 2 study 203 in 5% (2 cases) of patients in the maribavir 400 mg BID group death was 
reported and none of the SAEs resulting in death were considered to be treatment related. No signal 
could be identified based in the cases provided. 
Laboratory findings 
In Phase 3 study 303 the rates of potentially clinically significant creatinine values were comparable 
between treatment groups. Median change from baseline in liver function parameters, cholesterol, 
triglycerides, albumin, glucose, and creatine kinase were minimal at the last on-treatment assessment 
and the last on-study observation. According to the documentation, at the last on-treatment 
assessment, shifts from a lower NCI CTCAE grade to Grade 3 or 4 occurred in 4.4% of maribavir-
treated patients for glucose (IAT: 0%), in 3.2% of maribavir-treated patients for ALT (IAT: 0%) and 
4.1% of maribavir-treated patients for triglycerides (IAT: 1.0%). Therefore, the Applicant was 
requested to provide further information about these shifts in laboratory parameters and to justify the 
differences in treatment groups. Overall, no correlation to treatment with maribavir can be established 
based on the information of cases with shifts from a lower NCI CTCAE grade to Grade 3 or 4.  
No safety signal could be identified based on the data from Phase 2 studies 202 and 203.  
Safety in special populations 
Age, Sex, and Race 
Regarding age, sex and race no significant differences in safety data were identified.  
Assessment report

Renally Impaired Patients 
The Applicant was requested to compare safety data in patients with different degrees of renal 
impairment from Phase 3 study 303. Overall, 81 patients with normal renal function, 71 patients with 
mild renal impairment and 68 patients with moderate or severe renal impairment received maribavir 
during Phase 3 study 303. Based on the data provided, the safety profile was in general comparable 
between patient groups. As expected, the rate of blood creatinine increased was higher the worse the 
renal function was (mild renal impairment 5.6%, moderate/severe 10.3%).  
Hepatically Impaired Patients 
The Applicant was requested to compare safety data in patients with different degrees of hepatic 
impairment from Phase 3 study 303. Overall, only a very limited number of patients with hepatic 
impairment received maribavir during Phase 3 study 303 (9 patients with grade 1 and 4 patients with 
grade 2 hepatic impairment). Therefore, a meaningful comparison of the safety profile between 
patients with different degrees of hepatic impairment is not possible.   
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Pharmacokinetic-based DDI risk is low, and dose adjustment of maribavir is only needed when 
maribavir is coadministered with a strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducer. With the exception of selected 
immunosuppressants and rosuvastatin, coadministration with maribavir does not impact the use or 
outcomes of a wide range of other drugs commonly used in the target patient population. 
Regarding cases of immunosuppressant drug level increased, please see section AESIs above. 
Discontinuation due to AEs 
Phase 3 study 303 
In the Phase 3 study 303 the rate of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study-assigned treatment was 
significantly less in the maribavir group (13.2%) compared to the IAT group (31.9%). This difference 
was mainly driven by TEAEs in the SOCs of blood and lymphatic system disorders and renal and 
urinary disorders that led to treatment discontinuation in the IAT group.  
The most frequently reported on-treatment TEAE in the maribavir group dysgeusia led to treatment 
discontinuation for only 2 (0.9%) maribavir-treated patients. 
Phase 2 study 202 
In the Phase 2 study 202, 28% of patients in the maribavir 400 mg BID group were discontinued due 
to an AE. The rate was comparable in the maribavir 1200 mg BID group (33%) and higher in the 
maribavir 800 mg BID group (43%). When comparing to the Phase 3 study 303 the rate in the Phase 2 
study 202 was higher which could be explained by the significant longer treatment period (up to 24 
weeks). Furthermore, it should be noted that only a limited number of patients received maribavir 400 
mg BID (n=40). Except cases of CMV infection, no other particular TEAE led to discontinuation of 
maribavir in more than 1 patient in each treatment group. 
Phase 2 study 203 
In the Phase 2 study 203, 30% of patients in the maribavir 400 mg BID group were discontinued due 
to an AE compared to 12.5% of valganciclovir patients. The rates in the maribavir 800 mg BID and 
1200 mg BID groups were 12.5% and 25.6%. Compared to the Phase 3 study 303 the rate in the 
maribavir 400 mg BID group of the Phase 2 study 203 was higher which could be explained by the 
longer treatment period (up to 12 weeks). Furthermore, only a limited number of patients received 
maribavir 400 mg BID (n=40). Except cases of CMV infection, no other particular TEAE led to 
discontinuation of maribavir in more than 1 patient in each treatment group.

Determination of labelling of section 4.8 of the SmPC 
The Applicant sufficiently justified, which adverse reactions should be labelled in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC considering the recommendations in the SmPC-Guideline and the related TEAEs reported during 
Phase 3 Study 303. Furthermore, the Applicant carefully evaluated if further adverse reactions 
reported during Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies need to be included into section 4.8. The following 
adverse reactions are included in section 4.8 of the SmPC: 
For the determination of the frequency of adverse reactions the Applicant used the frequencies of 
adverse events reported during Phase 3 Study 303. Taking the concerns regarding a potentially biased 
relatedness assessment identified during the GCP inspection into account this is agreed. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of maribavir appears favourable and manageable in the treatment context, 
with dysgeusia and abdominal complaints as the main side effects.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The active substance is not included in the EURD list and a new entry will be required. The new EURD 
list entry uses the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. The requirements for 
submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the Annex II, 
Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request an alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date IBD. The IBD is 23 Nov 2021. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.  
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004 (REG), Livtencity (maribavir) is included  in 
the additional monitoring list as the medicinal product contains a new active substance which, on 1 
January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the Union.   
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The indication applied for by the Applicant is for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection 
and/or disease that are refractory (with or without resistance) to one or more prior therapies, including 
ganciclovir, valganciclovir, cidofovir or foscarnet in adult patients who have undergone a 
haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) or solid organ transplant (SOT). 
The aim of treatment is to prevent post-transplant progression of CMV infection and disease and the 
development of complications (i.e., CMV end-organ disease, graft loss and mortality) during the period 
of intense immunosuppression. The application rests on the surrogacy of impact on CMV viraemia to 
protect against symptomatic disease. This principle is broadly accepted, as illustrated by prophylactic 
and pre-emptive therapies. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Prior to the advent of antiviral therapies, CMV infection was a major cause of death post 
transplantation. The current standard of care involves empiric use of available anti-CMV agents such as 
ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir. The dose and duration of treatment with these 
agents, relative to the period in which a transplant recipient is immunosuppressed and at risk of 
breakthrough CMV infection/reactivation, is limited due to their respective toxicities and due to the 
development of resistance. 
Patients whose disease is resistant/refractory after treatment with first line anti-CMV agents, have 
limited treatment options and may ultimately lose their graft or die because of CMV infection or 
disease. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence of efficacy submitted is a single phase 3 multi-centre, randomised, open-label, 
active-controlled study SHP-620-303 to assess the efficacy and safety of maribavir (MBV) treatment 
compared to Investigator-assigned treatment (IAT) in haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and 
solid organ transplant (SOT) with CMV infections that are refractory or resistant to treatment with 
ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, or cidofovir. 
To be eligible for the study, patients had to have a documented CMV infection and had to have a 
current CMV infection that was refractory to the most recently administered of the four anti-CMV 
treatment agents building the IAT arm in this study, and may, in addition, had one or more resistance-
associated amino acid substitutions (RASs) known to confer resistance to ganciclovir/valganciclovir, 
foscarnet, and/or cidofovir at baseline. The definition of refractory used in study 303 was documented 
failure to achieve ≥1 log10 decrease in CMV DNA levels after 14 days or longer treatment. The 
definition of resistance in study 303 was defined as refractory CMV infection AND documentation of one 
or more CMV genetic mutations associated with resistance to ganciclovir/valganciclovir, foscarnet, 
and/or cidofovir.  
Patients (N=352) were randomised in a 2:1 allocation ratio to receive open label maribavir 400 mg BID 
or IAT for 8 weeks. Within the IAT group, the investigator selected the actual study treatment. The 
Assessment report

Page 170/171 
 
 
 
primary endpoint was CMV viraemia clearance at the end of study week eight, regardless of whether 
study-assigned treatment was discontinued before the end of stipulated 8 weeks of therapy. Patients 
who initiated alternative anti-CMV therapy or rescue treatment before Week 8 were counted as non-
responders.  
An alpha-protected secondary endpoint was CMV viraemia clearance and symptom control at the end 
of Study Week 8, followed by maintenance of this treatment effect for an additional 8 weeks off 
treatment (i.e., Follow-up Week 16) regardless of whether study-assigned treatment was discontinued 
before the end of stipulated 8 weeks of therapy. 
Supportive data of the antiviral efficacy of maribavir is derived from the -203 study. This was a Phase 
2, randomised, dose-ranging study to assess the safety and anti-CMV activity of 400 mg, 800 mg and 
1200 mg twice daily maribavir versus valganciclovir for the pre-emptive treatment of SOT or HSCT 
recipients with CMV infection without CMV organ disease or resistant/refractory CMV infection. 161 
patients were randomised equally to the four treatment arms. The primary endpoint was confirmed 
undetectable plasma CMV DNA (central laboratory) within 3 weeks and within 6 weeks, defined as 2 
consecutive post-baseline, on-treatment undetectable results (<200 copies/mL) separated by at least 
5 days. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The analyses for the primary endpoint in study 303 showed that the proportion of patients achieving 
confirmed CMV viraemia clearance at week 8 without a need for alternative anti-CMV therapy or rescue 
treatment was higher in the maribavir group compared to the IAT group (56% compared to 24%, 
adjusted difference in proportion of responders: 32.8 % (95%CI: 22.80, 42.74, p=<0.001). 
The treatment effect was consistent across transplant type, age group, and the presence of CMV 
syndrome/disease at baseline. Maribavir was numerically less effective against subjects with increased 
CMV DNA levels (≥ 50,000 IU/mL) and patients with absence of genotypic resistance to IAT. Moreover, 
the results on the primary endpoint were robust to several conservative sensitivity analyses. 
Efficacy results for the key secondary endpoint demonstrate that more patients in the maribavir 
achieved CMV viraemia clearance and CMV infection symptom control at Week 8, with maintenance of 
this treatment effect through Week 16 compared with patients in the IAT group (19% vs. 10%, 
respectively). The adjusted treatment difference (95% CI) in proportion of responders between the 
treatment groups was 9.5 (2.02, 16.88), p=0.013. 
Recurrence requiring anti-CMV treatment after Week 8 was reported for 34/131 (26.0%) of patients 
randomised to maribavir patients compared to 10/28 (35.7%) randomised to IAT. 
The antiviral effects of maribavir are further supported by the results of the -202 study. This confirmed 
a flat dose-response from 400-1200 mg maribavir, with 77% of patients reaching the primary endpoint 
of viraemia clearance at week 3 and 6, versus 65% in the active control arm. Moreover, the antiviral 
drug pressure of maribavir is mechanistically supported by the in vivo selection of resistant variants, as 
well as the frequency of viraemia recurrence on scheduled discontinuation. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The standard of care for relapsed or refractory CMV post-transplant, is the re-use of valganciclovir or 
the use of highly toxic alternative agents. The need for a control treatment of physician’s choice, the 
i.v. administration of some agents, and the need for specific monitoring with specific therapies 
Assessment report  
EMA/792160/2022 
Page 171/172 
 
 
 
necessitated an open-label trial design. The open-label nature of the study poses a risk of investigator 
bias.  
The management of control therapies might have been impacted by the availability of maribavir in 
case of discontinuation. However, there is no indication of bias sufficient to question the overall 
positive study results. 
Through the study design and given that viraemia control may occur without the resort of an antiviral 
agent (due to the restoration of immune competence), the pivotal study does not completely isolate 
the antiviral effects of maribavir. Based on the biology of CMV infection and the immune status of the 
patients, it is very unlikely that the week 8 results would have been achieved without effective antiviral 
therapy. This assertion is illustrated by the relapse frequency post scheduled discontinuation. 
The barrier to resistance of maribavir is slim. In many cases this results in a limited durability of 
response Moreover, after a fixed duration of 8 weeks of therapy, the virological control rate at week 16 
is low.  While the product information recommends a treatment duration of 8 weeks, treatment 
duration may need to be individualised based on the clinical characteristics of each patient. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The overall safety population consists of 1,555 patients which have been exposed to maribavir across a 
broad range of doses and treatment durations. Overall, the size of the presented safety database is 
sufficient to characterise the safety profile of maribavir. 
Maribavir was in general well tolerated. The most frequently reported TEAE during the Phase 3 study 
303 was dysgeusia, which occurred predominantly in maribavir-treated patients (maribavir: 37.2%; 
IAT: 3.4%). Maribavir was also associated with other gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea, 
nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Most events were mild to moderate in severity, occurred early 
upon initiation of treatment and were considered by the investigator to be related to maribavir. 
Dysgeusia led to treatment discontinuation for only 2 (0.9%) patients in Phase 3 study 303. 
Maribavir was shown to increase the whole blood trough concentration of tacrolimus by 57% in a drug 
interaction study. Accordingly, drug levels of immunosuppressants were monitored during Phase 3 
study 303. As expected, the TEAE of immunosuppressant drug level increased was reported in a higher 
proportion of patients in the maribavir group (9.0%) compared to the IAT group (0.9%). 
Compared to the IAT group maribavir showed an advantage in terms of the rate of neutropenia 
(maribavir group 9.4% vs IAT group 22.4%) reported during Phase 3 study 303. Furthermore, 
maribavir-treated patients had a lower incidence of TEAEs than foscarnet-treated patients for the TEAE 
acute kidney injury (8.5% and 21.3%). 
Discontinuation of treatment due to related TEAEs occurred in 4.7% of patients in the maribavir group 
and in 23.3% of patients in the IAT group. 
The rate of deaths in the Phase 3 study 303 (maribavir group 11.5%, IAT group 11.2%) was 
comparable between treatment groups. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The side effect profile of the comparator IAT drugs are complex and different between drugs, including 
haematological and renal toxicity. This leads to a potential lack of sensitivity to fully isolate and 
describe the safety profile of maribavir.

EMA/792160/2022

In the Phase 3 study 303, at baseline, the rate of patients with acute GVHD was numerically higher for 
patients in the maribavir group versus the IAT group (9.8% vs 6.8%). This could be a reason why the 
rate of a TEAE of new or worsening GVHD during the on-treatment observation period was higher in 
maribavir-treated patients (9.0%) compared to patients in the IAT group (4.3%). When comparing 
TEAEs of a new onset of treatment-emergent GVHD the difference between treatment groups is less 
pronounced (6% vs. 3.4%).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The purpose of antiviral therapy post transplantation is to suppress viraemia and prevent disease 
during the stage where the patient is profoundly immunosuppressed. Once immune function somewhat 
recovers, antiviral protection against CMV is no longer needed.  
The antiviral effect of maribavir may be inferred from the -303 study, supported by the -203 study. 
Methodological concerns raised regarding the pivotal study have been sufficiently addressed through 
sensitivity analyses and clarification of study conduct.  
The safety profile of maribavir is clearly superior to available treatments, with dysgeusia and 
abdominal complaints as the main side effects. There is no evident haematological or renal toxicity. 
The rate of viral suppression at week 8 indicates that the antiviral effect of maribavir results in clinical 
utility. The barrier to resistance of maribavir, however, is low. A cautionary statement to inform the 
prescriber that virologic failure can occur during and after treatment with maribavir was included in the 
SmPC.  
In summary, clinically relevant antiviral activity has been demonstrated, along with a favourable safety 
profile. It can be concluded that maribavir has clinical utility as part of the treatment armamentarium 
for patients that do not achieve virological control with first line agents such as ganciclovir. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Clinically relevant benefits in the claimed indication were shown for maribavir. The risks associated 
with maribavir use are adequately addressed in the product particulars.  The B/R balance is positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Livtencity is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion Livtencity (maribavir) is not similar to Prevymis (letermovir) 
within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.  
See Appendix on Similarity 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Livtencity is favourable in the following indication(s): 
LIVTENCITY is indicated for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and/or disease that are 
refractory (with or without resistance) to one or more prior therapies, including ganciclovir, 
valganciclovir, cidofovir or foscarnet in adult patients who have undergone a haematopoietic stem cell 
transplant (HSCT) or solid organ transplant (SOT). 
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antiviral agents. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
•  Periodic Safety Update Reports

out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
•  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP.

information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
to be implemented by the Member States 
Not applicable. 
These conditions fully reflect the advice received from the PRAC.  
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that maribavir is to be qualified 
as a new active substance in itself as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously 
authorised within the European Union.

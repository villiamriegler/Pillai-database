Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for florbetaben (18F), the 
scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Due to the very short half-life of 18F florbetaben (circa 110 minutes) the bone uptake of this 
compound is likely to be of limited clinical significance and overall associated to a level of risk 
compatible to the one derived from the ‘normal’ bio-distribution of the drug. However, the spurious 
signal resulting from non-specific ‘bone uptake’ in the face could lead to incorrect image 
interpretation. Therefore, due to the studies reported, the spontaneous report and the strong 
likelihood of a class effect, section 4.4 and 5.2 of the Summary of Product Characteristics should be 
updated with this safety concern.  
Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR, the PRAC considered that changes to 
the product information of medicinal products containing florbetaben were warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for florbetaben (18F) the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing florbetaben (18F) is unchanged subject 
to the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

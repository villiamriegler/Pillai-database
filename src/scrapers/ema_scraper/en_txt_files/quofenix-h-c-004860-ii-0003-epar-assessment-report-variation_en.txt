2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease and epidemiology 
Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is one of the most common causes of hospital admissions and 
death worldwide (Tejada 2018). It is the most infectious cause of sepsis globally with approximately 50% 
of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions due to CAP being associated with septic shock (Cilloniz 2019; Rello 
2008; Tejada 2018). Given that the global population is aging, it is expected that CAP will continue 
increasing as an outstanding public health problem (Tejada 2018). CAP incidence in Europe varies from 
20.6 – 79.9 per 10,000 person-years depending on country (Ferreira-Coimbra 2020).   
State the claimed therapeutic indication 
Quofenix is indicated for the treatment of the following infections in adults: 
• acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) 
 • community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) 
when it is considered inappropriate to use other antibacterial agents that are commonly recommended for 
the initial treatment of these infections (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. 
It should be considered that the second line indication CAP applied for is in line with the approved 
indication of moxifloxacin and levofloxacin.  
Aetiology and pathogenesis 
While S. pneumoniae remains the most common causative pathogen in CAP, other pathogens cause CAP 
including the atypical pathogens (L. pneumophila, M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae), S. aureus and 
Gram-negative bacteria, especially H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae (Cilloniz 2019; 
Tejada 2018). The main problem concerning the treatment of Gram-negative bacterial infections is their 
related antibiotic resistance (Cilloniz 2019). 
Clinical presentation and diagnosis  
Clinical presentation of CAP typically includes fever, productive cough, purulent sputum, dyspnea, and 
chest pain. A diagnosis of CAP is based on findings of tachypnea and rales, in case of consolidation 
including increased tactile fremitus, bronchial breath sounds, and possibly egophony. Empyema or 
parapneumonic effusion may cause decreased tactile fremitus and dullness on chest percussion (Baer, 
2019).  
EMA/226278/2021  
Page 8/144 
 
 
 
 
 
Management 
Empiric treatment of CAP is based on an array of factors, including likely pathogens and the possibility of 
resistance, patient comorbidities, the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and safety profiles of antibiotics, 
and treatment setting. Fluoroquinolones are recognized as established treatment options for CAP, both in 
the outpatient setting as well as in the hospital, by the European Respiratory Society and European 
Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ERS / ESCMID) management guidelines 
(Woodhead et al. 2011) as well as the Infectious Diseases Society of America / American Thoracic Society 
(IDSA / ATS) Guidelines (Metlay et al. 2019). 
The emergence and spread of respiratory pathogens resistant to macrolides, β-lactams, and other classes 
of antibiotics are a global public health concern and have begun to limit therapeutic options for CAP 
(Asche et al. 2008; File 2004; Niederman 2004; Pfaller et al. 2018). Antibiotic resistance among S. 
pneumoniae, the most prevalent CAP pathogen and the leading pathogen associated with mortality from 
CAP, poses a major therapeutic challenge. The commonly used macrolide class of antibiotics has 
increasingly been associated with high levels of pneumococcal resistance, approaching 50% in areas of 
North America and greater than 70% in China (Kim et al. 2012; Pfaller et al. 2018) and up to greater than 
35% in some European countries (ECDC 2018). 
Delafloxacin does not address an unmet need but would increase the availability of treatment options in 
face of rising antimicrobial resistance. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Delafloxacin is approved in the European Union (EU) and the United States (US) for the treatment of 
acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) in adults (in the EU as second line indication in 
line with other fluoroquinolones) and in the US it is also approved for community-acquired bacterial 
pneumonia (CAP). It is available as a sterile 300 mg lyophilized Captisol®-containing formulation for 
intravenous (IV) administration as well as a 450 mg tablet formulation for oral use. 
For this application, the MAH submitted data related to CAP indication. Furthermore, the MAH is referring 
to the prior data in the ABSSSI MAA (EMEA/H/C/004860/0000) of the oral and IV delafloxacin 
formulations. 
In addition, ADRs reported in CAP are pooled and analysed with ABSSSI data with the aim to update 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
2.1.3.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
GCP 
The MAH has provided statements that clinical trials were conducted in accordance with GCP. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
The absorption of delafloxacin was described and assessed during procedure EMEA/H/C/004860/0000. 
Distribution 
Study ML-3341-119 
This  was  a  Phase  1,  single-center,  open-label  study  to  assess  the  intrapulmonary  disposition  of 
delafloxacin in 30 healthy adult male and female subjects. Each subject received 300 mg delafloxacin IV 
as a 1-hour infusion every 12 h for a total of 7 doses over 4 days. Blood samples were collected on Day 
4 pre-dose and at 0.5, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h after the start of administration of the seventh 
dose  of  delafloxacin.  Each  subject  underwent  a  single  bronchoscopy  and  BAL  at  1  of  5  specified  time 
points (6 subjects per time point): 0.5, 1.5, 4, 8 and 12 h after the start of the infusion of the seventh 
dose.  Pooled  lavage  samples  of  each  subject  were  centrifuged  to  separate  AM  (cell  pellet)  and  ELF 
(supernatant). In addition, a blood sample to determine plasma urea concentration was collected just 
prior to scheduled bronchoscopy. Aliquots of BAL fluid were obtained to determine urea concentrations 
and differential cell count in BAL. 
Results: 
• 
PK of delafloxacin in plasma 
PK parameter of delafloxacin in plasma at steady state are shown in Table 2 and are comparable to results 
of previous studies in healthy adults. 
Table 2: Mean (%CV) Plasma Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Delafloxacin on Day 4 after 
Administration of Delafloxacin 300 mg IV Q12 h for 7 Doses
• 
PK of delafloxacin in ELF and AM 
Following the IV infusion, delafloxacin was taken up rapidly in ELF and AM with detectable levels at 0.5 h 
after start of the infusion. Mean concentrations in ELF and AM 0.5 h after start of infusion were 0.833 
µg/ml and 0.542 µg/ml, respectively, and remained detectable in ELF for 4 subjects and in AM for half of 
EMA/226278/2021

the subjects over the dosing interval of 12 h. For the first 4 h after dosing the estimated delafloxacin 
concentrations were higher in ELF than in AM (Table 3). 
Table 3: Mean (%CV) Concentrations of Delafloxacin in Plasma, Alveolar Macrophages and 
Epithelial Lining Fluid on Day 4 after Administration of Delafloxacin 300 mg IV Q12 h for 7 
Doses 
At steady state, based on AUC0-12 ratios, the exposure of delafloxacin in ELF and AM was at least 50% of 
the unbound exposure in plasma over the dosing interval, whether estimated based on the mean or the 
median concentrations of BAL samples at each specific sampled time point. For ELF, the relative exposure 
was  approximately  65%  of  unbound  plasma  exposure  whether  based  on  the  mean  or  the  median 
concentrations. For AM, the exposure based on mean concentrations was approximately 83% of unbound 
plasma exposure, but AM exposure based on median concentrations was approximately 51% of unbound 
plasma exposure ( 
Table 5). The difference between relative AM exposures appeared to be related to higher variability in 
individual AM concentrations at the 8-hour time point and below the limit of quantitation results at the 
12-hour  time  point  (Table  4).  Based  on  the  results  of  previous  studies  it  was  assumed  that  16%  of 
delafloxacin in plasma is unbound. 
Relative to total plasma delafloxacin concentrations, penetration ratios for exposure in ELF and AM over 
the12-hour dosing interval based on median concentrations were 0.102 and 0.082, respectively (Table 
5).

Table 5: Penetration Ratios of Delafloxacin AUC0-12 Values in Epithelial Lining Fluid and 
Alveolar Macrophages after Administration of Delafloxacin 300 mg IV Q12 h for 7 Doses 
Total exposures (AUC0-12) of delafloxacin in ELF based on mean or median ELF concentrations were 2.82 
h*ug/ml and 2.68 µg/ml, respectively. Total exposures (AUC0-12) of delafloxacin in AM based on mean 
and median ELF concentrations were 3.58 h*µg/ml and 2.15 h*µg/ml, respectively (Table 6).

Elimination 
The elimination of delafloxacin was described and assessed during procedure EMEA/H/C/004860. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose  proportionality  and  time  dependencies  of  delafloxacin  were  described  and  assessed  during 
procedure EMEA/H/C/004860. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
During studies RX-3341-303 in ABSSSI patients and ML-3341-306 in CAP patients, serial blood samples 
for PK analysis were obtained at selected investigative sites on Day 3 (± 1 day) of treatment within the 30 
minutes before study drug administration and at 1.5 and 3 hours after the start of dosing. All time points 
had a ± 10-minute window. Subjects were to receive a minimum of 3 consecutive doses of study drug 
before  the  start  of  PK  blood  collection.  Given  that  a  sparse  sampling  approach  was  employed 
non-compartmental PK analysis was not performed. Summary statistics were calculated for the plasma 
concentration-time  data  including  n,  mean,  SD,  coefficient  of  variation  (CV),  median,  minimum, 
maximum, and geometric mean for each planned time point regardless of which study day the sample 
was collected. These results were reported in Table 14.4.1 of the ML-3341-306 CSR. Summary statistics 
(geometric mean (CV%)) for individual, model-derived delafloxacin plasma exposure and secondary PK 
parameters by day for patients in study 303 with ABSSSI and patients in study 306 with CAP included in

the PK populations described in reports 00526-3 and 00593-1, respectively, are shown in Table 7. 
Table 7 Model-derived delafloxacin geometric mean (geometric CV%) plasma exposure and 
secondary PK parameters for patients with ABSSSI and CAP from studies 303 and 306 
Patients  with  CAP  compared  to  patients  with  ABSSSI  are  older  (mean  age  56.9  versus  46.3  years, 
respectively),  lighter  (74.9  kg  versus  80.7  kg,  respectively),  and  have  worse  renal  function  (mean 
normalised creatinine clearance (CLCR) 66.0 mL/min versus 84.4 mL/min). These differences are reflected 
in the higher observed exposures in the CAP patients. The values for T1/2 are similar for the 2 patient 
populations and the observed differences are probably not of clinical significance. While it cannot be ruled 
out that there exists a combination of physiologic factors in CAP patients that can explain the observed 
difference in Vc, one possible explanation is the fact that ABSSSI patients are more likely to experience 
significant oedema as a consequence of their infection, which could potentially account for the slightly 
higher Vc  in those patients. 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses 
Updated population pharmacokinetic analyses 
The objectives of the presented analyses are the following: 
• 
To evaluate the previously-developed delafloxacin population PK model via incorporation of data 
from patients with CAP enrolled in Study 306; 
and 
EMA/226278/2021  
Page 16/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
To qualify the resultant model for its ability to predict delafloxacin disposition in CAP patients and 
for use in PK-PD analyses for efficacy and simulations for PK-PD target attainment analyses.  
All data preparation and presentation were performed  using SAS Version 9.3 software. The population PK 
analysis was conducted using NONMEM® Version 7.4.3 (ICON Development Solutions, Ellicott City, MD) 
implementing  the  first-order  conditional  estimation  method  with  η-ε  interaction,  as  facilitated  by 
Perlspeaks-NONMEM Version 4.7.0 and Pirana Version 2.9.9. 
In study 306, approximately 860 male and female patients, 18 years of age and older with creatinine 
clearance  (CLcr)  greater  than  29  mL/min  who  had  evidence  of  acute  onset  of  CAP  were  enrolled  and 
randomized 1:1 to receive either delafloxacin or moxifloxacin. Total duration of treatment was 5 to 10 
days based on the investigator’s judgment. Patients assigned to the delafloxacin arm received 300 mg IV 
every 12 hours (q12h) as 1-hour infusions for six doses with an option to switch to delafloxacin 450 mg 
orally q12h for the remaining doses. Blood samples for PK evaluation were collected at selected sites on 
Day 3 pre-dose (approximately 30 minutes prior to dose administration) and at 1.5 and 3 hours after the 
start of the infusion, producing a PK dataset consisting wholly of observations following IV administration. 
A total of 316 individuals from Study 306 contributed an additional 946 plasma samples to the existing PK 
dataset, increasing the total number of individuals to 1,033 (30.6% CAP patients) and the total number 
of plasma samples to 13,407 (7.1% from CAP patients) across Phase 1-3 studies. Within Study 306, one 
plasma  sample  was  BLQ,  flagged  as  such,  and  excluded  from  PK  analysis,  with  13  additional  plasma 
samples  (1.4%  of  those  available)  determined  to  be  significant  outliers  and  also  excluded.  The  final 
resultant dataset was thus comprised of 12,829 delafloxacin plasma concentrations (932 from Study 306 
CAP  patients)  obtained  from  1,029  individuals  (316  CAP  patients),  with  96  of  these  individuals 
contributing 468 urine samples. 
Summary statistics of baseline demographics stratified by patient population and for the total cohort of 
infected patients are provided in Table 8. The overall patient population (n = 1,029) was 58% male, with 
broad  ranges  of  age  (18  to  89  years),  weight  (39.2  to  170  kg),  and  renal  function  (4.00  to  244 
mL/min/1.73  m2).  CAP  patients  enrolled  in  Study  306  tended  to  be  older  and  possessed  lower  renal 
function, though variability in demography was of similar extent as the ABSSSI patients.

Table 8: 
Summary statistics of patient demographics for the PK analysis population
Refinement of the delafloxacin population PK model occurred in two stages. First, a Bayesian estimation 
of individual PK parameters in Study 306 CAP patients and prediction-corrected visual predictive check 
(pc-VPC) was undertaken to externally validate the previously-developed population PK model (report 
00526-3).  
Goodness-of-fit plots did not show any significant bias, NPDEs further supported the suitability of the prior 
parameterization, centred around zero though with greater frequencies at the extremes than what would 
be observed under the standard normal distribution, consistent with a sparse sampling design in infected 
patients.  The  MAH  concluded  that  these  results  suggest  the  previously-developed  model  provides  an 
adequate prediction of delafloxacin disposition in this patient population. External validation via pc-VPC 
confirmed  agreement  of  central  tendency  and  of  lower  delafloxacin  plasma  concentrations,  but  an 
inability to capture the highest observations following repeated 300 mg IV dosing (Figure 1).

Figure 1: Prediction corrected visual predictive check of delafloxacin plasma data using the 
previously-developed population PK model 
Acknowledging  the  inclusion  of  likely  outliers  possibly  related  to  incorrect  timing  of  PK  sampling  or 
documentation of PK sampling (as determined by |CWRES| > 5), this process was repeated with such 
data excluded (n=13 plasma observations, as indicated in Table 1). This resulted in an improvement in 
goodness-of-fit, NPDEs, and pc-VPC, though an underprediction of the 95th percentile of observed data 
persisted. 
In an attempt to improve model predictions of the highest observed delafloxacin plasma concentrations in 
CAP patients, reestimation of plasma residual error components was performed under the assumption of 
an increased probability of dose administration and sample collection recording errors within a Phase 3 
setting. As this exercise produced insufficient improvement in the pc-VPC, the Study 306 CAP data was 
pooled  with  the  remaining  Phase  1  and  Phase  2/3  ABSSSI  data  with  all  fixed  and  random  effect 
parameters reestimated and addition of a third stratum of the preexisting central volume (Vc)-patient 
population  covariate  relationship  to  delineate  ABSSSI  from  CAP  patients.  Introduction  of  the 
interindividual  random  effect  for  maximal  intrinsic  clearance  (CLint,max)  into  the  previously  derived 
covariance matrix (consisting of interindividual random effects for renal clearance [CLR], central volume 
of distribution [Vc], first distributional clearance [CLd1], second peripheral volume [Vp2], absorption rate 
constant  [ka],  and  logit-transformed  total  bioavailability  [Ftotal,  logit])  resulted  in  significant 
improvement in model fit (ΔMVOF = -151.5) without evidence of overparameterization (condition number, 
161.2).  Notably,  such  incorporation  was  not  necessary  to  provide  adequate  capture  of  the  previous 
ABSSSI patient PK data. This model produced an unbiased and precise fit, with a pc-VPC of Study 306 
data providing better capture of the highest observed delafloxacin plasma concentrations in CAP patients 
(Figure 2).

patients using final pooled model 
Final  parameter  estimates  are  provided  in Table  9,  demonstrating  <10%  change  from  those  derived 
previously (Table 10) for all fixed effect parameters except the first peripheral volume (Vp1) [-19.8%] 
and the Vc-gender covariate effect (+17.8%). IIV was estimated to be larger for the majority of clearance 
and volume parameters than previously, with the exception of ω2-CLR, in line with the wider distribution 
of  delafloxacin  plasma  concentrations  observed  in  CAP  patients  following  IV  dosing.  Given  that 
reevaluation of univariate screening plots failed to reveal any significant trends, the MAH declared that 
the  model  was  final  and  suitable  for  providing  exposure  predictions  in  CAP  patients  for  use  in  PK-PD 
analyses  for  efficacy  and  simulation  for  PK-PD  target  attainment  analyses.  Explorations  of  age  as  a 
covariate  for  CLint,  max  and  Vc  revealed  parameter  estimates  reflective  of  null  values  with  great 
imprecision (%RSEs >200), and thus were not included in the final model.

To  assess  the  proposed  final  model’s  parameter  precision,  a  sampling  importance-  resampling  (SIR) 
procedure  was  performed.  Here,  the  final  model’s  covariance  matrix  is  utilized  as  an  initial  proposal 
EMA/226278/2021  
Page 21/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
distribution of parameter estimate values, generating a sufficiently large number of parameter vectors for 
evaluation against the analysis dataset. Each evaluation is then assigned a weight based on its MVOF in 
relation to that of the proposed final model, which collectively are used to resample parameter vectors 
closer to the true uncertainty distribution. This process is iteratively repeated for a user-defined number 
of times to arrive at parameter estimates and confidence intervals akin to those produced by a bootstrap 
resampling procedure. SIR results are considered final when the last two iterations’ ΔMVOF distributions 
overlap and fall below a reference χ-square distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the number of 
estimated model parameters. Additional diagnostics related to the adequacy of the proposal distribution 
and the adequacy of the sampling:resampling ratio provide information regarding how well the procedure 
captures  the  true  uncertainty  distribution  for  each  parameter:  in  both  cases,  no  trends  should  be 
observed.  Initially,  five  iterations  were  employed,  with  the  number  of  initial  samples/number  of 
importance resamples set at 1000/200, 1000/400, 1000/500, 2000/1000, and 2000/1000, respectively, 
to maximize efficiency; any additional iterations adopted a 2000/1000 ratio, to arrive at parameter point 
estimates and 95% confidence intervals based on 1000 sample vectors.  
SIR  results  could  be  considered  final  after  7  iterations,  without  spatial  or  temporal  trends  to  suggest 
deficiencies in capturing the true uncertainty distribution. As shown in Table 11, parameter means are 
aligned with those estimated during model development, with 95% confidence intervals consistent with 
the precision of the final model.

The final population PK model described was used to derive the Bayesian PK exposures of patients with 
CAP after delafloxacin IV administration. The summary statistics for delafloxacin plasma exposure and 
key secondary PK parameters, stratified by treatment day, for the patients with CAP are provided in 
Table 12 stratified by age category. Analogous estimates for ABSSSI patients, are provided in Table 13 
and showed minimal deviation from values reported previously (report 00526-3).

To  visually  assess  the  impact  of  covariate  relationships  retained  in  the  final  population  PK  model  on 
delafloxacin  plasma  exposures,  Day  1  and  Day  3  post-hoc  estimates  of  AUC0-24  and  Cmax  in  CAP 
patients enrolled in Study 306 were compared to simulated Day 1 and Day 4 values at various covariate

strata (such as degrees of renal impairment). Monte Carlo simulations (n=500 per scenario) using the 
final  population  PK  model  and  specified  delafloxacin  IV  and  PO  dosing  regimens  were  conducted  to 
produce distributions of predicted delafloxacin AUC0-24 and Cmax for each stratum (for AUC in Figure 3 
and for Cmax in Figure 4). Day 3 post-hoc exposures were leveraged instead of Day 4 as the design of 
Study 306 did not specify PK sampling beyond Day 3, which results in a lack of PK information following 
PO  dosing.  Reciprocally,  Day  4  simulations  were  favored  over  Day  3  to  afford  exposure  predictions 
following IV-to-PO switch. As steady-state delafloxacin exposure is expected to occur prior to Day 3, the 
MAH stated that this difference is not anticipated to affect interpretation of the comparison.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Delafloxacin N-methylglucamine salt hereafter referred to as delafloxacin, is an anionic fluoroquinolone 
antibiotic with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and 
atypical pathogens. The antibacterial activity of delafloxacin is due to the inhibition of bacterial 
EMA/226278/2021  
Page 25/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
topoisomerase IV and DNA gyrase (topoisomerase II), enzymes required for bacterial DNA replication, 
transcription, repair, and recombination. 
Primary pharmacology 
Delafloxacin is approved for the treatment of ABSSSI caused by susceptible isolates of S. aureus 
(including methicillin-resistant [MRSA] and methicillin-susceptible [MSSA] isolates), S. haemolyticus, S. 
hominis, S. lugdunensis, S.agalactiae, S. anginosus Group, S. dysgalactiae, S. mitis group, S. pyogenes, 
Enterococcus faecalis, E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae, K. oxytoca, K. pneumoniae , Proteus mirabilis and P. 
aeruginosa.  
The proposed indication is the treatment of adults with CAP caused by susceptible isolates of: 
• S. pneumoniae  
• S. aureus (MSSA) 
• E. coli 
• H influenzae  
• Chlamydia pneumoniae 
• Legionella pneumophila 
• Mycoplasma pneumoniae 
Antimicrobial spectrum of activity (in vitro) 
The in vitro activity of delafloxacin against selected clinically prevalent Gram-positive and Gram-negative 
pathogens including anaerobes has been determined via both a) preclinical profiling studies and b) 
surveillance studies.  
a) Pre-clinical Profiling studies 
The in vitro spectrum of activity of delafloxacin was analysed against several pathogens from the families 
of Staphylococci, Enterococci, Streptococci and Enterobacterales and others within the profiling studies 
that have already been submitted within the original submission for ABSSSI MAA. However, hereinafter 
the pre-clinical profiling study results for MIC50/90 determination of the most relevant pathogens 
associated with CAP should be summarised and outlined again (see Table 14, Table 15). Data for atypical 
pathogens associated with CAP (see Table 16) were included in those studies and are presented below 
since these organisms are not included in the recent surveillance studies.

Surveillance results have been discussed during initial submission and it was generally concluded that 
delafloxacin was shown to have potent in vitro activity for several bacterial species such as staphylococci 
or streptococci. Compared to levofloxacin and other antibiotics delafloxacin had an overall enhanced 
activity against Gram-positive isolates. Additionally, potent activity was also demonstrated against 
strains with quinolone resistance like MRSA. Delafloxacin was also shown to be active against 
Gram-negative isolates, although activity was decreased in isolates with high fluoroquinolone-resistance 
rates. 
A brief summary of the surveillance results for the pathogens most commonly involved in CAP is outlined 
below. 
Streptococcus pneumoniae 
Delafloxacin and comparators were tested against 5,095 isolates of S. pneumoniae using the CLSI 
susceptibility testing methods. For fastidious organisms collected during 2018, data in delafloxacin 
susceptibility were also generated in line with EUCAST´s broth microdilution susceptibility testing 
guidelines recommendations. A comparison of the MIC results obtained in line with either CLSI or EUCAST 
methodologies revealed that there was no striking difference in MICs between both methods (see Figure 
5).

Figure 5: Delafloxacin MIC Distribution Against S. pneumoniae Collected During 2018 
Surveillance from Europe / US by EUCAST and CLSI methodologies 
For delafloxacin 50/90 % of all of the tested isolates either in the EU or US were inhibited at 
concentrations of 0.015/ ≤0.03 µg/mL (see Table 18). Furthermore, the MIC50/90 values remained 
constant from year to year and by region (see Table 19). Activity of levofloxacin as well as of moxifloxacin 
against S. pneumoniae isolates was shown to be less effective. Tested isolates also included 
penicillin-susceptible (PSSP), penicillin-intermediate (PISP) as well as penicillin-resistant (PRSP) S. 
pneumoniae strains. The same MIC50/90 values as for the total amount of isolates apply to these 
phenotypes indicating a consistent and potent activity regardless of penicillin-susceptibility phenotype. 
Delafloxacin however, showed decreased activity against levofloxacin-resistant S. pneumoniae (LVX-R) 
with MIC50/90 values of 0.12 µg/mL and 0.5 µg/mL, respectively.

Table 19: Percentage MIC Distribution, MIC50 and MIC90 of Delafloxacin Against S. 
pneumoniae Collected During 2014 - 2018 by year and by region. 
Of the evaluated EU isolates of S. pneumoniae, 21.4% were PISP and 5.2% were PRSP based on EUCAST 
non-meningitis breakpoints. A high degree of resistance to erythromycin was observed. 
The same was true for the evaluated US isolates from whom 35.3% were PISP and 3.5% were PRSP based 
on oral penicillin breakpoints. Again, a high degree of these strains was resistant to erythromycin. 
Staphylococcus aureus 
The current clinical breakpoints for S. aureus established by EUCAST are ≤0.25 µg/mL (S) and 
>0.25 µg/mL (R). According to current surveillance data (2014-2018) MIC values are generally low with 
overall MIC50/90 values of 0.008 µg/mL and 0.5 µg/mL for S. aureus, respectively, and remained constant 
from year to year and by region. In contrast, overall levofloxacin MIC50/90 values were shown to be 0.25 
µg/mL and >4 µg/mL, respectively.  
MRSA rates were generally lower among European isolates (22.2%) compared to US isolates (43.2%). 
Delafloxacin showed for both, EU and US isolates, potent activity (see Table 20). MIC50/90 values for EU 
and US MSSA isolates were ≤0.004/0.008 µg/mL and ≤0.004/0.06 µg/mL, respectively. For MRSA the 
MIC90 values for EU and US isolates were 1 µg/mL. Anyhow, the majority of MRSA (72.1%) had 
delafloxacin MIC values ≤0.25 µg/mL. Overall, high proportions of tested isolates (between 30% and 
100%) were highly resistant to erythromycin, clindamycin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin according to 
EUCAST criteria. Levofloxacin-resistance was more pronounced in MRSA isolates. However, delafloxacin 
remained good activity even in these isolates with MIC90 values of 1 µg/mL and 2 µg/mL for EU and US 
isolates, respectively.

Haemophilus influenzae 
The testing of delafloxacin against H. influenzae isolates (N=2,634) revealed potent activity of 
delafloxacin with overall MIC50/90 values of ≤0.001/0.002 µg/mL compared with MIC90 values of 
0.03 µg/mL, 0.015 µg/mL, and 0.06 µg/mL for levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin, respectively 
(see Table 21). There was no significant difference between EU and US isolates and the MIC distribution 
was similar from year to year and by region (see Figure 6).  
Overall, isolates were highly susceptible to all evaluated agents excluding ampicillin and 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). Analyses revealed that 18.2% (227/1,249) of the European 
and 30.9% (299/969) US isolates were ß-lactamase positive. However, potent activity could still be 
shown for delafloxacin and other fluoroquinolones regardless of ß-lactamase phenotype (see Module 
2.7.2, Table 2.7.2-41).

Surveillance by Year and by Region 
Haemophilus parainfluenzae 
Delafloxacin as well as comparator antibiotics (see Table 22) was also tested against 136 
H. parainfluenzae isolates. Overall, MIC90 for delafloxacin was low with 0.015 µg/mL. Interestingly, a 
difference in MIC values has been determined between EU and US isolates as MIC90 for EU isolates (N=44) 
was >0.25 µg/mL while it was 0.015 µg/mL for US isolates (see Module 2.7.2, Table 2.7.2-42). Generally, 
the MIC distribution for delafloxacin was similar from year to year and by region (see Figure 7).

Potent  activity  was  shown  for  most  of  the  tested  antibiotics  against  H.  parainfluenzae.  Delafloxacin 
showed potent activity against H. parainfluenzae isolates with a MIC90 value of 0.015 mg/L compared with 
0.12  mg/L,  0.03  mg/L  and  0.25  mg/L  for  levofloxacin,  ciprofloxacin  and  moxifloxacin,  respectively. 
Susceptibility to ampicillin and TMP/SMX was comparably worse as shown for H. influenzae isolates.  
Only 4.4% of the total isolates tested were ß-lactamase positive and regardless of phenotype delafloxacin 
was shown to have potent activity (see Module 2.7.2, Table 2.7.2-46).  
Table 22: Delafloxacin and Comparator Activity Against H. parainfluenzae During 2015 – 2018 
European and US Surveillance. 
Moraxella catarrhalis 
M. catarrhalis isolates (N=1500) from the EU and US showed overall MIC50/90 values for delafloxacin of 
0.004/0.008 µg/mL for surveillance between 2015-2018. The MIC distribution was consistent from year 
to year and by region (see Module 2.7.2, Figure 2.7.2-20).  
Isolates were tested against the same comparator antibiotics as shown for Haemophilus spp. (see Table 
23). Analyses revealed that all of the tested antibiotics had potent activity against M. catarrhalis except 
for penicillin. Analyses for ß-lactamases revealed that >96% of the isolates were ß-lactamase positive 
(96.7% (638/660) and 98.0% (630/643) amongst European and US isolates, respectively). However, 
ß-lactamase phenotype had no relevant influence on delafloxacin, levofloxacin or moxifloxacin activity 
(see Module 2.7.2, Table 2.7.2-51). In comparison to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, delafloxacin was 
shown to be 8-fold more active.

European and US Surveillance 
E. coli 
Overall delafloxacin MIC50/90 values for E. coli during Surveillance from 2014-2018 were 0.06 µg/mL and 
4 µg/mL, respectively and distribution was similar from year to year and by region (EU and US).  
Similar MIC values were obtained for other fluoroquinolones like levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin or 
moxifloxacin. About 20.0% of the isolates collected within Europe and the US were ESBL-producers, with 
slightly more ESBL-producers amongst the European isolates than the US isolates (21.2% (1,459/6,867) 
vs. 18.4% (1,015/5,501), respectively. Similar to other fluoroquinolones, delafloxacin was more potent 
against non-ESBL isolates (with MIC50/90 of 0.03-0.06/4 µg/mL compared to 4/>4 µg/mL for the 
ESBL-isolates). The MIC distribution was bimodal (see Module 2.7.2, Figure 2.7.2-23) reflecting 
decreased delafloxacin activity in ESBL isolates. 
K. pneumoniae  
For the 6038 K. pneumoniae isolates collected between 2014-2018, 33.1 % [1,966/6,038] of them 
screened ESBL-positive with a higher proportion of ESBL-producers in EU vs. US isolates (47.7% 
[1,484/3,111] vs. 17.5% [512/2,927]). CRE rates were also higher for EU than US isolates (11.8% 
[368/3,111] vs. 2.0% [58/2,927]). As with the other fluoroquinolones, delafloxacin was more potent 
against non-ESBL isolates with an MIC50/90 of 0.12 / 0.5 mg/L but against ESBL and CRE isolates, all the 
fluoroquinolones, including delafloxacin, had MIC50/90 values of > 4 / > 4 mg/L (see Table 24).  
The MIC distribution for delafloxacin on a geographic and phenotypic level (see Figure 8) indicates that (i) 
MICs from 2 to >4 µg/mL are more distributed in EU isolates and (ii) that ESBL and CRE isolates have 
higher MIC values compared to non-ESBL isolates reflecting the MIC50/90 data for both phenotypes (see 
Table 24).

Figure 8: MIC distribution by region and phenotype.  
P. aeruginosa 
Delafloxacin showed activity against P. aeruginosa isolates (N=6,302) comparable to levofloxacin and 
ciprofloxacin with MIC50/90 values of 0.5/>4 µg/mL (see Table 24). About 20.6% of 6,301 tested isolates 
from the Surveillance studies were tested as ceftazidime resistant (CAZ-R). Furthermore, about 37.2% 
and 29.8% of tested strains were levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin resistant, respectively. Resistant rates for 
piperacillin-tazobactam (Pip-Taz) were 24.6% of the tested isolates (see Module 2.7.2, Table 2.7.2-61).

Susceptibility testing methodology 
Bacterial susceptibility was assessed using standard broth microdilution susceptibility test methods 
according to CLSI (CLSI M7-A10, 2015) which were compliant with EUCAST methodology for 
non-fastidious organisms. However, MIC testing for fastidious organisms according to CLSI differed from 
the EUCAST methodology (which requires the use of MHF medium). 
To compare both methods (CLSI and EUCAST) two additional studies have been submitted by the MAH 
(ECOFF-DELA-01; 17-MEL-07). Both studies aimed to determine the susceptibility of fastidious and 
non-fastidious organisms to delafloxacin according to EUCAST SOP and finally results were compared 
EMA/226278/2021  
Page 36/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with the surveillance data for European isolates using CLSI methodology. The results are described 
below: 
ECOFF-DELA-01 
Study ECOFF-DELA-01 was conducted at 5 Italian centres and collected at least 30 isolates of each of 11 
non-fastidious and 9 fastidious species and tested these using EUCAST methodology (EUCAST Media 
Preparation v 5.0, 2017) in line with ISO 20776-1 standards.  
In vitro activity of delafloxacin (MIC distribution and MIC50/90) using EUCAST methodology was 
comparable to or better than that seen against the European surveillance isolates using CLSI testing 
methodology (Table 25). 
In summary, study ECOFF-DELA-01 confirmed the activity of delafloxacin against both Gram-positive and 
-negative CAP pathogens against isolates and demonstrated that delafloxacin MICs were comparable to 
or lower when EUCAST susceptibility methodology is used compared with CLSI susceptibility testing 
methodology. 
17-MEL-07 
In addition to the above described ECOFF-DELA-01 study, the 17-MEL_07 study was the first  study 
conducted to compare EUCAST and CSLI Methodology. 17-MEL 07 study was conducted at 2 centres in 
Italy and at JMI Laboratories.  
A total of 899 fastidious organisms were randomly selected from the delafloxacin surveillance isolates 
collected during 2017 and tested according to the EUCAST and ISO 20776-1 standards.  
The MICs obtained were then compared with the MICs originally obtained by JMI Laboratories using CLSI 
methodology Table 26.  
Delafloxacin showed potent activity against the 899 strains of nine fastidious species (S. pneumoniae, H. 
influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, M. catarrhalis, S. agalactiae, S. anginosus GP, S. dysgalactiae, S. mitis 
group, S. pyogenes) tested and, overall, delafloxacin MIC values were similar by EUCAST and CLSI 
methods.  
In vitro activity of delafloxacin (MIC distribution and MIC50/90) using EUCAST methodology for the nine 
fastidious species tested was comparable to or better than that seen against the European surveillance 
isolates using CLSI testing methodology Table 26.

Susceptibility Testing Methodology. 
Bactericidal activity 
Studies of the bactericidal effects were conducted with delafloxacin using MBC and time-kill assessments 
based on CLSI guidelines (CLSI M26-A, 1999). Delafloxacin was bactericidal against several 
Gram-positive as well as Gram-negative CAP-relevant bacterial species (S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, H. 
influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae , P. aeruginosa etc.). Delafloxacin demonstrated rapid and 
concentration-dependent killing in time-kill assays against a diverse array of Gram-positive and 
Gram-negative CAP-pathogens confirming a bactericidal effect, as well.

Factors affecting in vitro susceptibility of delafloxacin 
Factors affecting the in vitro susceptibility of delafloxacin have already been discussed during MAA for 
ABSSSI. However, it should be noted in the context of this line extension that no effect of pulmonary 
surfactants on the activity of delafloxacin against pulmonary pathogens (S. aureus, S. pneumoniae 
(PISP/PRSP), H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis) was detected.   
In vitro antibacterial activity - clinical studies 
Baseline Microbiology from Phase III CAP – ML-3341-306  
Causative pathogens were identified by isolation from a baseline culture specimen (either a respiratory 
specimen or blood), by urinary antigen, serology, and/or PCR in the Phase III (ML-3341-306). Local or 
regional laboratories performed routine culture of all sputum and blood specimens. Bacterial isolates were 
forwarded to the central microbiology laboratory for confirmation of identity, antimicrobial susceptibility 
testing, and further molecular or phenotypic characterization.  
Of 746 subjects 453 subjects (60.7%) had at least 1 pathogen detected at baseline by any method 
(including culture, serology, PCR, and urinary antigen), comprising the modified Intention-To-Treat 
(ModITT)-1 population.   
Overall, the distribution of all pathogens between the two treatment groups was well balanced at baseline 
in the ModITT population. The most common baseline pathogens detected (by any method) were S. 
pneumoniae (43.3%), H. parainfluenzae (13.2%), M. pneumoniae (12.6%), H. influenzae (11.9%), L. 
pneumophila (11.7%), S. aureus (11.7%), C. pneumoniae (7.7%), K. pneumoniae (6.6%), E. coli 
(5.5%), P. aeruginosa (5.3%). Among 125 baseline S. pneumoniae isolates with susceptibility test results 
available, 26.4% were macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae (MRSP) (33 isolates), 1.6% were 
penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) (2 isolates), and 1.6% were multiple drug-resistant S. 
pneumoniae (MDRSP) (2 isolates). Overall, 0.4%, 7.0%, and 0.4% of S.  pneumoniae from 
delafloxacin-treated subjects, respectively, were penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), 
macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MRSP), or multiple drug-resistant Streptococcus 
pneumoniae (MDRSP). The distribution in the moxifloxacin-group was similar.The atypical pathogens (M. 
pneumoniae, L. pneumophila, and C. pneumoniae) were commonly encountered. Percental distribution 
was 14.0%, 11.4%, and 9.2%, respectively, for delafloxacin-treated subjects and 11.1%, 12% and 
6.2%, repectively, for moxifloxacin-treated subjects. S. aureus was encountered frequently in both the 
delafloxacin and moxifloxacin treated patients. One isolate of MRSA was identified in the delafloxacin 
group and none in the moxifloxacin-group, whereas 52 isolates were identified for MSSA, which were 
equally distributed in both groups. 
Most of the infections in the delafloxacin and moxifloxacin groups were monomicrobial with Gram-positive 
infections compared to polymicrobial infections (~60% monomicrobial vs 36% polymicrobial infection) in 
the ModMITT-1 population.  
Summary of Activity of Delafloxacin Against Target Pathogens at Baseline 
The MIC summary statistics (MIC range, MIC50, and MIC90) for delafloxacin against key baseline target 
pathogens in the ModMITT-2 analysis are summarized in  
Table 27.

(ModMITT-2; Delafloxacin and Moxifloxacin Treatment Groups).
EMA/226278/2021  
Page 40/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As shown in  
Table 27, delafloxacin had potent activity against target Gram-positive pathogens overall by MIC50 and 
MIC90. Based on MIC90 values at baseline, delafloxacin exhibited at least 16-fold greater activity than 
moxifloxacin for all Gram-positive and fastidious Gram-negative pathogens in the ModMITT-2 population. 
The majority of these isolates were FQ-S, macrolide-susceptible, and penicillin-susceptible (PSSP), 
methicillin-susceptible (MSSA), or β-lactamase-negative (Haemophilus spp.). However, delafloxacin 
retained potent activity against resistant phenotypes found in S. pneumoniae (PRSP, PISP, MRSP, 
MDRSP), Haemophilus species (β-lactamase and MR) and S. aureus (MRSA, FQ-RSA MSSA). Delafloxacin 
and moxifloxacin had similar activity against M. pneumoniae isolates (including 2 MR isolates), and 
delafloxacin had greater activity than moxifloxacin against L. pneumophila isolates including 
macrolide-resistant isolates .  
Delafloxacin and ciprofloxacin demonstrated comparable activity against Enterobacterales and P. 
aeruginosa isolates. The majority of these isolates were FQ-S. Delafloxacin demonstrated reduced 
activity to fluoroquinolone-nonsusceptible and ESBL phenotypes.  
A comparison of the delafloxacin MIC distribution against clinical study isolates (ModMITT-2; both 
treatment arms) to that observed in recent surveillance for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative target 
pathogens is shown by histoGram in Figure 9.  
In these histoGrams the MIC distribution of delafloxacin against target pathogens isolated in clinical 
studies (ModMITT-2 population; both treatment arms) is shown relative to recent global surveillance (US 
and European isolates from 2014 to 2018). Overall, the delafloxacin MIC distribution observed with 
clinical study isolates was similar to that observed during recent global surveillance. However, only 2 
isolates of PRSP and 1 isolate of MRSA was obtained from patients in the clinical trial.

Resistance 
Like  other  fluoroquinolone-class  antibacterial  agents,  delafloxacin-resistant  mutants  were  selected  in 
vitro at a very low frequency (< 10-9) during spontaneous mutation studies at concentrations 4 × the MIC 
and above. 
In both laboratory-derived mutants and clinical isolates, the predominant mutation in S. aureus observed 
was  in  Ser84-Leu  in  gyrA/Ser80-Tyr  or  Ser80-Phe  in  grlA.  For  both  laboratory-derived  and  clinical  S. 
aureus isolates with double mutations in gyrB and gyrA, higher delafloxacin MIC values were observed, 
but such isolates had decreased fitness in vitro relative to the parent strain. 
For  ABSSSI  clinical  isolates,  delafloxacin  demonstrated  high  rates  of  microbiological  response  against 
levofloxacin  nonsusceptible  isolates  as  well  as  isolates  with  documented  mutations  in  the 
quinolone-resistance determining region (QRDR). 
For  Gram-negative 
isolates,  delafloxacin, 
like  other 
fluoroquinolones,  can  be  affected  by 
plasmid-mediated resistance mechanisms such as Qnr (target protection), Oqx (efflux pumps), and / or 
the aminoglycoside acetyltransferase AAC-6’-lb-CR-like (enzymatic inactivation). This was apparent in 
fluoroquinolone-resistant  Enterobacteriaceae  in  CAP  clinical  trials  isolates  and  to  a  lesser  extent  in 
ABSSSI Enterobacteriaceae clinical trial isolates. 
EMA/226278/2021  
Page 43/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Emergence of Resistance During Therapy  
Genotypic resistance analyses (molecular QRDR analysis) of clinical isolates was conducted in the Phase 
3 study (ML-3341-306) if sequential isolates from the same patient demonstrated > 4-fold increase in a 
delafloxacin and / or moxifloxacin MIC value.  
One subject in the delafloxacin arm and three subjects in the moxifloxacin arm met this criterion. 
In summary, one confirmed incidence of emergence of resistance during therapy occurred in a 
delafloxacin treated subject in study ML-3341-306. While a > 4-fold increase in fluoroquinolone MIC 
values were observed in 3 H. parainfluenzae isolates from moxifloxacin treated patients, all of the paired 
isolates were found to be unrelated. It is interesting to note, that all of the isolates that had a > 4-fold 
increase in fluoroquinolone MIC values were H. parainfluenzae and 3 out of the 4 isolates were genetically 
unrelated.  
Animal Therapeutic studies 
The efficacy of delafloxacin was evaluated in several animal models of infection. Delafloxacin was highly 
effective in protecting mice from systemic lethal infections caused by S. aureus including MRSA, and S. 
pneumoniae, and to a lesser extent effective in protection against E. coli and P. aeruginosa; in 
neutropenic thigh infections caused by S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae , and P. 
aeruginosa; in pulmonary infections caused by S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae and in a murine 
pyelonephritis model. Delafloxacin was also effective in neutropenic thigh infections caused by S. 
pneumoniae in neutropenic rats. In rats, delafloxacin was further active against Gram-negative and 
Gram-positive bacteria in a rat granuloma pouch infection. 
Secondary pharmacology 
Pharmacodynamic interaction with other medicinal products or substances 
The antimicrobial interaction of delafloxacin with other agents from different antibiotic classes (cyclic 
lipopeptides [Daptomycin], oxazolidinones [Linezolid], carbapenems [Meropenem], cephalosporins 
[Ceftazidime], sulphonamides and trimethoprim, glycopeptides [Vancomycin], tetracyclines 
[Tigecycline], polymycins [Colistin] and monobactams [Aztreonam]) was assessed by measuring 
fractional inhibitory concentrations via checkerboard panels for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative 
bacteria. Based on the mean fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) values the antimicrobial 
interaction was found to be indifferent for all antibiotic combinations and bacteria evaluated in 
checkerboard titration studies. 
Besides of the above mentioned studies which have already been submitted and discussed during initial 
MAA for ABSSSI the MAH submitted a new study (12-05-2018-Melinta 9v2) which again analysed the 
antimicrobial interaction of delafloxacin using antibiotics typically used to treat CAP pathogens. 
As shown in Table 28 the mean FICI values for delafloxacin in combination with other agents were >0.5-4. 
In line with the interpretation criteria (< 0.5 = synergy, >0.5-4 = additive/indifferent, and >4 = 
antagonism) it can be concluded that there was no signal for synergy or antagonism between delafloxacin 
and agents commonly used in the treatment of respiratory infections among target respiratory 
pathogens. Thus, a co-administration of the tested agents is principally possible.

2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
Non-clinical PK/PD targets – PK/PD index 
Delafloxacin´s PKPD relationships have been investigated in vitro in a one-compartment model for H. 
influenzae, and in vivo in both neutropenic thigh and neutropenic lung murine models.  
In vitro 
H. influenzae 
According to Lorian 2005 H. influenzae does not exhibit sufficiently growth in the lungs of rodents over a 
24 h period as compared to the other pathogens. Thus, the PD target was defined by a 
one-compartment-infection in vitro model (00543).  
The free-drug AUC/MIC ratio associated with efficacy against a panel of five clinical H. influenzae isolates 
from surveillance studies (including 2 WT strains and 3 fluoroquinolone non-susceptible strains (MICs 
from 0.001 to 1 µg/mL; see Module 2.7.2, Table 2.7.2-84)) was determined through a series of 
dose-ranging susceptibility studies in a one-compartment in vitro infection model delivering 24-hour 
delafloxacin concentration-time profiles representing those observed in humans after IV administration. 
Density of drug-resistant sub-populations was evaluated, as well. 
The strains at initial bacterial burden of 106 CFU/mL were exposed to delafloxacin regimens ranging from 
0.09 to 15000 mg q12h and PK profiles were measured (see Table 29).  
Table 29: Summary of delafloxacin doses studied and associated free-drug AUC values for 
each of the delafloxacin dosing regimens evaluated in the one-compartment dose-ranging 
studies. 
All doses were administered over a 1-hour infusion simulating a 4-hour half-life and free-drug profiles 
assuming 84% human protein binding. Samples were collected over the study duration for enumeration 
of total and resistant bacterial burden as well as observation of simulated PK profiles. Data from the 
dose-ranging studies were pooled and modelled using Hill-type models and non-linear least squares 
regression. All data was weighted using the inverse of the estimated measurement variance. The 
relationship between the change in log10 CFU from baseline at 24 hours and the AUC/MIC value was 
evaluated.  
EMA/226278/2021  
Page 46/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Results revealed that 4/5 strains responded to all of the tested dosing regimens. The median fAUC/MIC 
ratio associated with net bacterial stasis and 1- and 2-log10 CFU/mL reductions from baseline at 24 hours 
were 23.5, 28.7, and 36.0, respectively (see Table 30). There was some inter-isolate variability in target 
values (up to 2-fold): 
Table 30: Summary of Free-drug AUC/MIC Ratio Targets and Mean Parameter Estimates for 
H. influenzae Isolates 
The Hill models describing the relationship between change in log10 CFU/mL from baseline at 24 hours and 
delafloxacin fAUC/MIC ratio for individual H. influenzae isolates described the data well (r2 values of 
0.823 to 0.989; see Table 30). However, dose fractionation was not performed in this study and 
comparison with other potential PKPD indices is not presented. 
With regard to possibly resistant subpopulations it was shown that no resistance could be observed for the 
tested wild-type (WT)-strains.  
In vivo 
Murine thigh infection model 
Neutropenic mouse thigh infection models (NMTIM) were used to investigate the in vivo PK-PD index 
(PDI) relating to efficacy in ABSSSI which has already been described in the D80 AR for ABSSSI MAA. 
However, for a better understanding a brief overview of the results is given below: 
The PDI in neutropenic murine thigh infection models was evaluated against 5 strains of S. aureus (incl. 
MRSA and MSSA), 3 P. aeruginosa isolates as well as 3 E. coli strains (incl. 1 ESBL-positive, MDR strain). 
The PK/PD index (PDI) for delafloxacin that mostly correlated with efficacy was found to be fAUC24/MIC as 
shown in the linear square regression analysis (see Figure 11).

Murine lung infection model 
The PDT for delafloxacin in the context of this variation was further determined based on a neutropenic 
mouse lung infection model (NMLIM) against S. aureus including MRSA and MSSA, S. pneumoniae (PSSP 
and PRSP), K. pneumoniae (1 WT, 3 ESBL-positive and 8 additional clinical isolates from patients with 
pneumonia) as well as P. aeruginosa in two studies performed in 2016 and 2019 (see Table 32; 
PK-3341-028; (Lepak and Andes 2016)). Delafloxacin MIC´s for the tested strains ranged between 0.004 
to 4 µg/mL.

Table 32: MIC Values for Isolates Used in Neutropenic Murine Lung Infections Model 
Neutropenic mice were treated with delafloxacin single subcutaneous doses of 2.5, 10, 40, and 160 
mg/kg and PK parameters (AUC, Cmax, t1/2) were measured at different time points for groups of three 
mice (see Figure 12).

Figure 12: Single-dose plasma pharmacokinetics of delafloxacin in neutropenic mice. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters listed in the box include maximum drug concentrations (Cmax), 
the AUC from 0 h to infinity (AUC), and the elimination half-life (t1/2) for each dose. 
For in vivo studies, four-fold increasing doses of delafloxacin were administered (q6h) to infected mice 
and CFUs were counted after 24 hours. The lung infection was produced by administration of 50 µl of 
inoculum into the nares of the mice (~ 107.3-8.4 CFU/mouse). Delafloxacin therapy was initiated 2 h after 
infection. The correlation between efficacy and PK/PD parameter was determined by non-linear 
last-square multivariate regression. AUC/MIC was chosen as PDI abased on previous studies. The 
relationship between 24 h AUC/MIC is graphically shown in Figure 13 A-F. The coefficient of determination 
(R2) estimating the variance that might be due to regression was shown to be 0.89 for S. aureus, 0.70 for 
S. pneumoniae, and 0.49 for K. pneumoniae tested in 2016. K. pneumoniae was additionally tested in 
2019 and results revealed R2 of 0.71 or rather 0.66 considering tested isolates in 2016 and 2019. For P. 
aeruginosa a R2 value of 0.84 was calculated. 
The mean fAUC/MIC required for net stasis or a 1-log10 reduction compared to the start of therapy was 
calculated for each drug-organism combination, along with the associated 24 hours total and free drug 
AUC/MIC targets. The results are displayed in Table 33 below. 
The median fAUC24/MIC 1-log10 kill target was 7.92 for S. aureus, 3.36 for S. pneumoniae, 64.1 for 
K. pneumoniae considering isolates tested in 2016 and 2019, and 68.2 for P. aeruginosa. For 
K. pneumoniae 1-log10 kill was achieved for 6/12 isolates and for P. aeruginosa for 4/5 isolates. 1-log10 kill 
was achieved for all of the other tested strains.

PK/PD modelling  
Dose selection 
To support the dosing regimens (IV, IV to PO, and PO only) for treatment of patients with CAP in clinical 
studies (Phase III), PTA analyses were conducted using the results of the NMLIM studies for S. aureus and 
S. pneumoniae  (PDTs for 1-log10 kill of 3.36 and 7.92, respectively) and a popPK model for IV delafloxacin 
to support the dose selection for the CAP clinical trial. In this context, free-drug plasma 
concentration-profiles were generated for 5,000 simulated patients with varying degrees of renal function 
following 300 mg IV, q12 h for 3 days followed by 450 mg PO, q12 for 2 days. Overall, percent probabilities 
of PTA were ≥ 93.3%. The MAH concluded that the data supported a dosing regimen in Study ML-3341-306 
of 300 mg IV, q12 for 3 days followed by 450 mg PO, q12 for 2 days in CAP patients with normal renal 
function and mild or moderate renal impairment. 
PK/PD relationships for efficacy 
Results of the PK/PD relationship analyses for efficacy are based on data from subjects with CAP enrolled in 
study ML-3341-306. Using data from microbiologically evaluable (ME) populations, PK/PD relationships were 
evaluated for efficacy endpoints as outlined in Table 34 below:  
Table 34: Summary of efficacy endpoints by study visit and analysis populations 
Univariable relationships for dichotomous efficacy endpoints were examined to identify relationships 
between the probability of achieving each efficacy endpoint (including clinical and microbiological endpoints) 
and delafloxacin fAUC24/MIC ratio, fAUC24, and MIC. A total of 145 delafloxacin-treated patients were 
included in the ME Populations that had PK data and at least one pathogen with MIC data isolated at baseline. 
Additionally, these patients were evaluable for ECR at 96 ± 24 hours or clinical response at EOT or TOC. After 
exclusion of nasopharyngeal (NP) cultures, a total of 132 patients were available with CAP pathogens of 
interest. Responses for efficacy endpoints are shown in Table 35.

Table 35: Summary of successful responses for efficacy endpoints by visit based on data for all 
patients and patients with S. pneumoniae or Haemophilus species at baseline. 
Further analyses revealed that >90% of patients with S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus spp., and S. aureus at 
baseline achieved >90% of non-clinical plasma fAUC/MIC targets associated with 1-log10 and 2-log10 CFU 
reduction (see Table 36).

For clinical response at EOT or TOC and microbiological response at TOC, univariable PK/PD relationships 
were identified based on data from patients with Haemophilus spp. at baseline (see 00593-2, Table 25). For 
fAUC:MIC ratio evaluated as a continuous variable, fAUC:MIC ratios of 4,501 to 5,092 were required to 
achieve percent probabilities of success of 90.0%. For fAUC:MIC ratio evaluated as a two-group variable, the 
percentage of patients with successful responses were 55.6% to 66.7% and 95.5% to 95.8% for fAUC:MIC 
ratio < 1,464 and ≥ 1,464, respectively (see Figure 14). 
Figure 14: Univariable relationships between the percent probability of clinical success at EOT 
and free-drug plasma AUC:MIC ratio evaluated as a continuous (A) and twogroup variable (B) 
based on data from patients with Haemophilus species at baseline and all baseline cultures. 
PTA based on Phase 3 data from patients with CAP 
PopPK modeling and MCS were conducted to determine PTA based on nonclinical PD targets for delafloxacin 
identified for different CAP relevant species. The overall objective was to evaluate delafloxacin IV, IV-to-PO, 
and PO dosing regimens for CAP patients and interpretive criteria for the in vitro susceptibility testing of 
delafloxacin against S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae .  
Two sets of simulations were performed including data from 315 CAP patients of Study 306 (ML-3341-306). 
The dataset was replicated 10 times, yielding a population of 3,150 simulated patients, and further 
assessed. PK parameters were calculated using the final popPK model ( 00524-1). The generated PK profiles 
were then used to assess delafloxacin PTA for plasma, using non-clinical PDTs for 1-log10 and 2-log10 CFU 
reduction as follows (see Table 37):

The following dosing regimens have been evaluated for patients with normal renal function (90 ≤ CLcr <200 
mL/min/1.73 m2), mild (60 ≤ CLcr < 90 mL/min/1.73 m2) , moderate (30 ≤ CLcr < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), and 
severe renal impairment (15 ≤ CLcr < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and ESRD patients  (w/wo dialysis) (5 ≤ CLcr <

The PTA analyses conducted for the different populations and the bacterial species are summarized below. 
Since in line with the application the use in ESDR patients is not intended, this population will not be 
considered in the assessment and descriptions below. 
The percent probabilities of PK-PD target attainment by MIC on Days 1 and 4 for delafloxacin for the different 
dosing regimens were analysed among simulated patients by renal function group or those resembling the 
clinical trial population (see Table 38). The analyses are based on the median plasma fAUC/MIC ratio target 
for the respective pathogens for 1-log10 and 2-log10 CFU reduction. 
S. pneumoniae 
IV 
The % PTA by MIC on Days 1 and 4 for IV delafloxacin for S. pneumoniae associated with 1-log10 kill as well 
as 2-log10 kill was >90% or close to 90% for MICs of up to 1 mg/L or 0.12 mg/L on Days 1 and 4, respectively 
(see Table 38). The same PTA analyses based on randomly assigned fAUC/MIC ratio targets among the 
different patient populations revealed that PTA of close to or over >90 % were only achieved for MICs up to 
0.5 µg/mL (for 1-log10 kill) or rather 0.06 µg/mL and 0.12 µg/mL for some populations taking a 2-log10 kill 
into account (see 00593-2, Table 31).  
Sub-analyses for % PTA by MIC on Days 1 and 4 based on data from S. pneumoniae isolates collected from 
centers in Europe and the USA between 2014-2018 revealed that independently from geographical region or 
resistance phenotype >90 % PTA have been achieved among all patient populations either for 1-log10 kill or 
2-log10 kill (see Table 39). The results are congruent using the median or randomly assigned fAUC/MIC ratios 
(see 00593-2, Table 32).

The percent probabilities of PTA by MIC distributions for PRSP and non-PRSP isolates from the EU and US 
collected in 2014 to 2018 are graphically shown in Figure 15. 
Figure 15: Percent probabilities of PK-PD target attainment by MIC on Days 1 and 4 based on

upon the MIC distribution for S. pneumoniae isolates collected during 2014 to 2018 from Europe 
and the USA combined. 
IV- to-PO 
The % PTAs by MIC on Days 1 and 4 for the IV-PO dose regimen are similar to those for the IV dosing 
regimen only. Values of >90% or close to 90% PTA associated with 1-log10 or 2-log10 kill were described for 
MICs of up to 1 mg/L or 0.12 mg/L on Days 1 and 4, respectively (see Table 38). The PTA analyses was also 
performed based on randomly assigned fAUC/MIC ratio targets. According to the results PTAs associated 
EMA/226278/2021 
Page 59/144 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
with 1-log10 kill were >90 % for MIC of 0.25 µg/mL and <90% for MICs of 0.5 µg/mL. For a 2-log10 kill PTAs 
of >90% were achieved for MICs of up to 0.06 µg/mL and in some populations even for MICs of 0.12 µg/mL 
(see 00593-2, Table 35). 
According to the sub-analyses overall % PTA on Days 1 and 4 based on median or randomly assigned 
fAUC/MIC ratios for 1-log10 kill and the MIC distribution from S. pneumoniae EU and US isolates collected 
between 2014-2018 PTA ranged between 99.9% and 100%. The % PTA based on MIC distribution for PRSP 
and non-PRSP ranged between 99.7% and 100% (see 00593-2, Table 34 & 36). 
The percent probabilities of PK/PD target attainment by MIC on Day 1 and Day 4 overlaid upon MIC 
distributions for S. pneumoniae surveillance isolates are shown in Figure 16.

PTAs for 1-log10 kill ranged between 87.1% and 98.2% at a MIC value of 1 µg/mL. For the endpoint of 2-log10 
reduction the PTAs were >90% for a MIC value of 0.12 µg/mL. Across simulated patient populations PTAs on 
Days 1 and 4 based on randomly assigned fAUC/MIC ratio targets associated with 1-log10 kill ranged between 
85.0% and 92.9% for a MIC value of 0.5 µg/mL while PTAs >90% were reached for lower MICs. PTAs for 
2-log10 kill showed values >90% for a MIC of 0.0.6 µg/mL (see 00593-2, Table 39).  
According to the sub-analyses overall % PTA on Days 1 and 4 based on median or randomly assigned 
fAUC/MIC ratios for 1-log10 kill and 2-log10 kill and the MIC distribution from S. pneumoniae EU and US 
isolates collected between 2014-2018 PTA were >90% independently from geographic region or resistance 
phenotype (see 00593-2, Table 38 & 40). 
The percent probabilities of PK/PD target attainment for the oral dosing regimen associated with 1-log10 kill 
by MIC on Day 1 and Day 4 overlaid upon MIC distributions for S. pneumoniae surveillance isolates are 
shown in Figure 17.

the clinical trial population after administration of the delafloxacin PO dosing regimen, overlaid 
upon the MIC distribution for S. pneumoniae isolates collected during 2014 to 2018 from Europe 
and the USA combined. 
The MAH concluded, that based on surveillance data for S. pneumoniae isolates (MIC50/90 of 0.015/0.03 
µg/mL) a susceptible breakpoint of ≤ 1 µg/mL would cover >99 % of all S. pneumoniae isolates incl. 
resistance phenotypes like PRSP or MRSP. Further, clinical study outcome revealed that a clinical success 
rates of 93.7% was reached taking the ModME-1-TOC population into account (for more details refer to 
section 2.4.).  With regards to the PTA analyses it was concluded that for all of the tested dosing regimens 
(IV, IV-PO, PO) PTAs on Days 1 and 4 based on median fAUC/MIC ratio targets for 1-log10 kill of >99% were 
reached for the clinical trial population at a MIC value of 1 µg/mL. Thus, interpretative criteria of ≤ 1/ > 1 are 
proposed for S. pneumoniae.  
H. influenzae 
IV 
The % PTAs by MIC on Days 1 and 4 were analyzed for H. influenzae and are outlined in Table 40. The 
analyses are based on the median plasma fAUC/MIC ratio target for H. influenzae for 1-log10 and 2-log10 CFU 
reduction. PTA results for 1-log10 reduction are >90% for a MIC value of 0.12 µg/mL in the relevant 
populations on Days 1 and 4. Target attainment of >90% was shown for a 2-log10 kill at a MIC value of 0.06 
µg/mL while PTAs ranged between 83.6% and 99.7% for a MIC of 0.12 mg/mL. The same analyses based on 
randomly assigned fAUC/MIC ratios revealed nearly the same results. PTA results for 1-log10 reduction were 
>90% for a MIC value of 0.12 µg/mL except for patients with normal renal function on Day 1 (88.6 %). 
Target attainment of >90% was shown for a 2-log10 kill at a MIC value of 0.06 µg/mL while PTAs ranged 
between 79.2% and 97.6% in the relevant populations for a MIC of 0.12 mg/mL.

Analyses of overall % PTA by MIC on Days 1 and 4 based on data for H. influenzae isolates collected from 
centers in Europe and the USA between 2014-2018 revealed that % PTA was near to 100% based on the MIC

IV-to-PO 
The PTAs for 1-log10 CFU reduction from baseline for the IV-to-PO dosing regimen in relevant populations 
showed PTAs above 90% for a MIC value of 0.12 µg/mL with the exception of patients with normal renal 
function on Day 4 for whom the PTA was 88.7% at a MIC of 0.12 µg/mL. For a 2-log10 kill PTAs at a MIC of 
0.12 µg/mL ranged between 74.4% and 99.3%. Across simulated patient groups % PTAs based on randomly 
assigned fAUC/MIC ratio targets associated with 1-log10 kill were >90% for a MIC of 0.06 µg/mL in all of the 
analysed groups as well as for all of the patient groups at a MIC of 0.12 µg/mL with the exception of patients 
with normal function. For these group PTAs of 88.6% and 83.5% on Days 1 and 4, respectively, were 
achieved. Results for 2-log10 reduction were less good with PTAs ranging between 71.8% and 96.5% at a 
MIC of 0.12 µg/mL. 
The analyses of overall % PTA by MIC on Days 1 and 4 based on data for H. influenzae isolates collected from 
centers in Europe and the USA between 2014-2018 revealed that % PTA was >99% independently of using

PO 
The PTAs for 1-log10 CFU reduction from baseline for the IV-to-PO dosing regimen in relevant populations 
showed PTAs above 90% for a MIC value of 0.12 µg/mL with the exception of patients with normal renal 
function on Days and 4 for whom the PTA was 85.9% and 88.1%, respectively. For a 2-log10 kill PTAs at a 
MIC of 0.12 µg/mL ranged between 68.8% and 96.0% while PTAs were >90% for all patient populations for 
a MIC value of 0.06 µg/mL. Results for % PTA for simulated patient groups based on randomly assigned 
fAUC/MIC ratio targets associated with 1-log10 or 2-log10 kill were similar to those observed based on the 
median fAUC/ratio target (see 00593-2, Table 51).  
The analyses of overall % PTA by MIC on Days 1 and 4 based on data for H. influenzae isolates collected from 
surveillance studies in the EU and US between 2014-2018 revealed that % PTA was >99% independently of 
using median or randomly assigned fAUC/MIC ratio targets (see 00593-2, Table 49 & 51).  
The percent probabilities of PTA on Days 1 and 4 for the PO dosing regimen by MIC distributions for H. 
influenzae isolates from the EU and US collected in 2014 to 2018 are graphically shown in Figure 18 C.   
The MAH concluded that based on surveillance data for H. influenzae isolates (MIC50/90 of ≤0.001/0.002 
µg/mL) a susceptible breakpoint of ≤ 0.12 µg/mL would cover 99.5 % of all H. influenzae isolates incl. 
ß-lactamase positive strains. Further, clinical study outcome revealed that a clinical success rates of 95.2% 
was reached taking the ModME-1-TOC population into account (for more details refer to section 2.4. ).With 
regards to the PTA analyses it was concluded that for all of the tested dosing regimens (IV, IV-PO, PO) PTAs 
on Days 1 and 4 based on median assigned fAUC/MIC ratio targets for 1-log10 kill of > 96% were reached for 
the clinical trial population at a MIC value of 0.12 µg/mL. Thus, interpretative criteria of ≤ 0.12/ > 0.12 are 
proposed for H. influenzae.  
S. aureus 
IV 
The % PTA by MIC on Days 1 and 4 for IV delafloxacin for S. aureus associated with 1-log10 kill was >90% 
for a MIC value of 0.5 µg/mL except for patients with normal renal function on Day 1 for whom the PTA was 
88.3% at this MIC value. The PTAs predict > 99% coverage for MICs up to and including 0.25 mg/L and 
100% coverage for MICs of 0.12 mg/L and below regardless of renal status. PTAs for a 2-log10 reduction from 
baseline were >90% for a MIC value of 0.06 µg/mL and showed a broad range of 52.0% to 93.3% for a MIC 
of 0.12 µg/mL. Results for the % PTAs based on randomly assigned fAUC/MIC ratio targets were comparable 
although a little worse for both endpoints (1-log10 and 2-log10 kill) (see 00593-2, Table 55).  
The % PTAs on Days 1 and 4 based on data for S. aureus isolates from surveillance studies revealed for all 
of the patient populations that values of >90% (independently of using median or randomly assigned 
fAUC/MIC ratio targets) were achieved for all isolates combined from EU and US or EU alone  (see Table 43 
and 00593-2, Table 54 & 56). Focussing on MRSA and MSSA isolates it became clear that % PTAs for Days 
1 and 4 were above 90 % for either 1-log10 kill or 2-log10 kill for MSSA isolates. However, the % PTAs for 
MRSA ranged between 81.0% and 90.3% across simulated patient populations. 
Percent probabilities of PK-PD target attainment by MIC on Days 1 and 4, based on median and randomly 
assigned free-drug plasma AUC:MIC ratio targets associated with a 1-log10 CFU reduction from baseline

dosing regimen, overlaid upon the MIC distribution for S. aureus isolates collected during 2014 
to 2018 from Europe and the USA combined. 
IV-to-PO 
For S. aureus with the IV-to-oral dosing regimen, the PTAs predicted a similar coverage to the IV dose 
regimen with almost complete coverage (> 99%) for MICs up to and including 0.25 mg/L. The % PTA by MIC 
on Days 1 and 4 for IV-to-PO delafloxacin for S. aureus associated with 1-log10 kill was >90% for a MIC value 
of 0.5 µg/mL except for patients with normal renal function on Day 1 and 4 for whom the PTAs were 88.3% 
and 81.0%, respectively at this MIC value. PTAs for a 2-log10 reduction from baseline were >90% for a MIC 
value of 0.06 µg/mL and showed a broad range of 39.5% to 89.3% for a MIC of 0.12 µg/mL. Results for the 
% PTAs based on randomly assigned fAUC/MIC ratio targets were comparable although a little worse for 
both endpoints (1-log10 and 2-log10 kill) (see 00593-2, Table 59).  
The % PTAs on Days 1 and 4 based on data for S. aureus isolates from surveillance studies revealed for all 
of the patient populations that values of >90% (independently of using median or randomly assigned 
fAUC/MIC ratio targets) were achieved for all isolates combined from EU and US or EU alone  (see Table 
43and 00593-2, Table 58 & 60). PTAs for MSSA isolates were >90%, as well, either for 1-log10 kill or 2-log10 
kill. In contrast, % PTAs for Days 1 and 4 for MRSA ranged between 82.0% and 89.1% for relevant 
populations for 1-log10 kill while PTAs for 2-log10 kill were less good (between 40.4% and 50.7%).

PO 
The % PTA by MIC on Days 1 and 4 for IV-to-PO delafloxacin for S. aureus associated with 1-log10 kill was 
>90% for a MIC value of 0.5 µg/mL except for patients with normal renal function on Day 1 and 4 for whom 
the PTAs were 76.1% and 80.3%, respectively at this MIC value. PTAs predict > 99% coverage for MICs up 
to and including 0.25 mg/L and 100% coverage for MICs of 0.12 mg/L and below regardless of renal status. 
PTAs for a 2-log10 reduction from baseline were >90% for a MIC value of 0.06 µg/mL. Results for the % PTAs 
based  on  randomly  assigned  fAUC/MIC  ratio  targets  were  comparable  although  a  little  worse  for  both 
endpoints (1-log10 and 2-log10 kill) (see 00593-2, Table 63).  
The % PTAs on Days 1 and 4 based on data for S. aureus isolates from surveillance studies revealed for all 
of the patient populations that values of >90% (independently of using median or randomly assigned 
fAUC/MIC ratio targets) were achieved for all isolates combined from EU and US or EU alone  (see Table 43 
and 00593-2, Table 62 & 64). PTAs for MSSA isolates were >90%, as well, either for 1-log10 kill or 2-log10 kill. 
In contrast, % PTAs for Days 1 and 4 for MRSA ranged between 80.8% and 89.1% for relevant populations 
for 1-log10 kill while PTAs for 2-log10 kill were less good (between 39.0% and 52.2%).  
Percent probabilities of PK-PD target attainment by MIC on Days 1 and 4, based on median and randomly 
assigned free-drug plasma AUC:MIC ratio targets associated with a 1-log10 CFU reduction from baseline 
among simulated patients resembling the clinical trial population, are shown in Figure 19 C. 
The MAH concluded that based on surveillance data for S. aureus isolates (MIC50/90 of ≤0.004/0.5 µg/mL) a 
susceptible breakpoint of ≤ 0.25 µg/mL would cover 88.3% of contemporary S. aureus isolates as well as 
72.1% and 9.2% of contemporary MRSA and MSSA isolates, respectively. Further, clinical study outcome 
revealed that a clinical success rates of 92.3% was reached taking the ModME-1-TOC population into 
account (for more details refer to section 2.4. ). With regards to the PTA analyses it was concluded that for 
all of the tested dosing regimens (IV, IV-PO, PO) PTAs on Days 1 and 4 based on median assigned fAUC/MIC 
ratio targets for 1-log10 kill of > 99% were reached for the clinical trial population at a MIC value of 0.25 
µg/mL. Thus, interpretative criteria of ≤ 0.25 / > 0.25 are proposed for S. aureus.  
K. pneumoniae  
For K. pneumoniae only endpoints for fAUC/MIC ratio targets associated with 1-log10 kill have been analysed 
since 2-log10 kill could be observed in the animal in vivo models for a few strains only.  
IV 
The % PTA by MIC on Days 1 and 4 for IV delafloxacin for K. pneumoniae associated with 1-log10 kill was 
>90% for a MIC value of 0.06 µg/mL except for patients with normal renal function for whom on the PTA was 
89.7% on Day 1. At MIC 0.03 mg/L, PTAs predict > 99% coverage regardless of renal status. Results based 
on randomly assigned fAUC/MIC ratio targets showed that the MIC covered with PTAs >90 % was 2-fold 
lower than for the analyses using median assigned fAUC/MIC ratio targets.  
Full coverage (PTA >90%) was thus observed for a MIC value of 0.015 µg/mL while the PTAs for a MIC of 
0.03 µg/mL ranged between 86.0% and 92.4% for the relevant populations (see 00593-2, Table 65). 
The overall % PTAs by MIC on Days 1 and 4 based on the median and randomly assigned fAUC:MIC ratio 
targets for K. pneumoniae among simulated patients by renal function group or those resembling the clinical

based on data for K. pneumoniae from EU and US surveillance studies range between 29.3% and 52.9% for

The % PTA by MIC on Days 1 and 4 for IV delafloxacin for K. pneumoniae associated with 1-log10 kill was 
>90% for a MIC value of 0.06 µg/mL except for patients with normal renal function for whom on the PTA was 
89.7% on Day 1 and 83.0% on Day 4. Results based on randomly assigned fAUC/MIC ratio targets showed 
that the MIC covered with PTAs >90 % was 2-fold lower than for the analyses using median assigned 
fAUC/MIC ratio targets. Full coverage (PTA >90%) was thus observed for a MIC value of 0.015 µg/mL while

PO 
The % PTAs by MIC on Days 1 and 4 analyzed for K. pneumoniae and the PO dosing regimen are outlined in 
00593-2, Table 69. The analyses are based on median assigned plasma fAUC/MIC ratio target for K. 
pneumoniae associated with 1-log10 CFU reduction. PTA results for 1-log10 reduction are >90% in total for a 
MIC value of 0.03 µg/mL in the relevant populations on Days 1 and 4. This was also true for a MIC value of 
0.06 µg/mL with the exception of patients with normal renal function for whom PTAs of 78.6% and 82.3% 
were achieved on Day 1 and 4, respectively. The results based on randomly assigned plasma fAUC/MIC ratio 
target for K. pneumoniae associated with 1-log10 CFU reduction show a total coverage (>90% PTA) for a MIC

of 0.015 µg/mL although the PTAs for a MIC of 0.03 µg/mL achieved also PTAs near to 90% ranging between 
82.5% and 91.1%. 
The overall % PTAs by MIC on Days 1 and 4 based on the median and randomly assigned fAUC:MIC ratio 
targets for K. pneumoniae among simulated patients by renal function group or those resembling the clinical 
trial population after administration of the delafloxacin dosing regimens is shown in Table 44. The PTAs 
based on data for K. pneumoniae from EU and US surveillance studies range between 24.0% and 49.8% for 
the relevant populations only. 
A graphical illustration of the % PTAs by MIC on Days 1 and 4 based on median and randomly assigned 
fAUC/MIC ratio targets associated with a 1-log10 CFU reduction from baseline among simulated patient 
populations resembling the clinical trial population after administration of the delafloxacin IV dosing 
regimen, overlaid upon the MIC distribution for K. pneumoniae isolates from surveillance (EU and US) is 
shown in Figure 20 C. 
The MAH concluded that 62.5% of contemporary K. pneumoniae isolates would be covered by a susceptible 
breakpoint of 0.25 µg/mL. Furthermore, it was stated that a clinical success rate of 81.3% (13/16) was seen 
using the ModME-1TOC population (for more details refer to section 2.4. ). However, the MAH conceded that 
the PTA analyses taking all dosing regimens into account revealed low coverage since PTAs >90% were 
achieved for a MIC value of 0.06 µg/mL, only. Looking at the analyses based on the randomly assigned 
fAUC/MIC ratio target % PTAs above the critical cut-off of 90 % were reached for a MIC of 0.015 µg/mL, 
only. The MAH further stated that proposed interpretative criteria of ≤0.25 / <0.25 µg/mL are supported by 
the data and that the target attainment data underestimate clinical outcomes since a clinical success rate of 
81.3% was observed. Finally, the conclusion was drawn that due to lower percent probabilities of PK/PD 
target attainment for K. pneumoniae at relevant MIC values, supportive data should be considered.  
P. aeruginosa 
For P. aeruginosa only endpoints for fAUC/MIC ratio targets associated with 1-log10 kill have been analysed 
since 2-log10 kill could be observed in the animal in vivo models for a few strains only. 
IV, IV-to-PO, and PO 
The % PTAs by MIC on Days 1 and 4 analyzed for P. aeruginosa and the IV, IV-PO, and PO dosing regimen 
are outlined in 00593-2, Table 71/73/75. The analyses based on median assigned plasma fAUC/MIC ratio 
target for P. aeruginosa associated with 1-log10 CFU reduction show the same tendency for all of the tested 
dosing regimens. PTA results for 1-log10 reduction are near to or >90% for a MIC value of 0.25 µg/mL, and 
>99% was achieved for MICs up to and including 0.12 µg/mL regardless of renal status. However, for the 
IV-PO and PO dosing regimen PTAs between 83.9% and 92.4% were achieved for patients with normal renal 
function on Days 1 and 4. The results based on randomly assigned plasma fAUC/MIC ratio target for K. 
pneumoniae associated with 1-log10 CFU reduction were basically the same taking one dilution factor lower 
(MIC of 0.125 µg/mL associated with PTAs near to or >90%) into account.  
The overall % PTAs by MIC on Days 1 and 4 based on the median and randomly assigned fAUC:MIC ratio 
targets for K. pneumoniae among simulated patients by renal function group or those resembling the clinical 
trial population after administration of the delafloxacin dosing regimens is shown in Table 45. The PTAs 
based on data for K. pneumoniae from EU and US surveillance studies range between 34.3% and 59.7% for 
the IV dosing regimen, between 31.9% and 56.7% for the IV-PO dosing regimen, and between 29.9% and 
55.0% for the PO regimen, only.

median and randomly assigned free-drug plasma AUC:MIC ratio targets associated with a 
1-log10 CFU reduction from baseline for P. aeruginosa among simulated patients resembling the

overlaid upon the MIC distribution for P. aeruginosa isolates collected during 2014 to 2018 from 
Europe and the USA combined. 
The MAH concluded that only 35% of contemporary P. aeruginosa isolates would be covered by a susceptible 
breakpoint of 0.25 µg/mL. Furthermore, it was stated that a clinical success rate of 91.7% (11/12) was seen 
using the ModME-1TOC population (for more details refer to section  2.4). However, the MAH conceded that 
the PTA analyses taking all dosing regimens into account revealed low coverage since PTAs >90% were 
achieved for a MIC value of 0.06 µg/mL, only. Looking at the analyses based on the randomly assigned 
fAUC/MIC ratio target % PTAs above the critical cut-off of 90 % were reached for a MIC of 0.015 µg/mL, 
only. The MAH further stated that proposed interpretative criteria of ≤0.25 / <0.25 µg/mL are supported by 
the data and that the target attainment data underestimate clinical outcomes since a clinical success rate of 
81.3% was observed. As breakpoints or posology are no longer being pursued for P. aeruginosa and K. 
pneumoniae, no further analyses are considered warranted.  
Breakpoints 
Proposed clinical breakpoints (see Table 46) are based on delafloxacin MIC distribution in contemporary 
clinical isolates, available PD modelling data and both clinical and microbiological outcome by delafloxacin 
MIC.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  penetration  of  delafloxacin  in  ELF  and  AM  was  investigated  in  study  ML-3341-119.  Following  IV 
administration  of  300  mg  delafloxacin  in  healthy  subjects  at  steady  state,  the  achieved  delafloxacin 
concentrations  in  ELF  and  AM  were  lower  than  in  plasma.  Relative  to  unbound  plasma  exposure,  the 
exposure in ELF and AM as measured by AUC0-12 were 64% and 51%, respectively, based on the median 
concentrations at each sample time. 
PK plasma samples were collected from CAP patients in study ML-3341-306 at 3 time points on Day 3 of 
treatment (within 30 minutes before study drug administration and at 1.5 and 3 hours after start of the 
infusion).  Delafloxacin  exposure  (AUC  and  Cmax)  was  generally  higher  in  CAP  patients  than  in  ABSSSI 
patients.  These  differences  could  be  explained  by  differences  in  age,  weight  and  renal  function  between 
these two patient groups. An updated population pharmacokinetic analysis was reported including data from 
CAP patients of study ML-3341-306. With the updated combined dataset, the model was slightly refined. 
Parameters of the final model were in a similar range compared to the previous analysis. A wider distribution 
of exposure is seen in CAP patients compared to ABSSSI patients. This is at least in part expected due to the 
higher  number  of  older  patients  and  more  patients  with  impaired  renal  function  included  in  study  306 
compared to the previous studies. Overall, model performance appeared acceptable. 
With regard to pharmacodynamics adequate data for delafloxacin have been submitted to evaluate PD in the 
context of this line extension although ELF data have not been taken into account for any PK/PD analysis. 
Given  the  lack  of  reliable  pre-clinical  ELF  data  for  delafloxacin  and  uncertainties  regarding  the  clinical 
relevance of ELF data, results of the Phase 3 study are considered sufficient to support the indication. PTA 
analyses based on plasma PK/PD targets are considered adequate and the chosen PDI for efficacy has been 
justified. The results of the PK/PD analyses might suggest that the initially proposed dosing regimens are far 
too low for CAP caused by K. pneumoniae or P. aeruginosa. However, the MAH has agreed that a posology 
or  clinical  breakpoints  for  K.  pneumoniae  or  P.  aeruginosa  are  no  longer  being  pursued.  Given  that  K.

pneumoniae  and  P.  aeruginosa  are  considered  less  relevant  in  the  indication  CAP  but  are  rather  more 
associated with nosocomial pneumonia (HAP/VAP), no further investigations or analyses regarding these 
pathogens  are  warranted  within  this  extension  of  indication  variation  for  the  second  line  indication  CAP 
Overall,  it  is  agreed  that  PK/PD  analyses  support  the  proposed  dosing  regimens  for  CAP  caused  by  S. 
pneumoniae, S. aureus and H. influenzae. The breakpoints set by EUCAST have been adopted for the SmPC. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
All issues raised have been adequately addressed. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The indication applied for is: 
Treatment of community acquired pneumoniae (CAP) in adults when it is considered inappropriate to use 
other antibacterial agents that are commonly recommended for the initial treatment of these infections. 
Dosage recommendations are given for IV delafloxacin with the option to switch to oral delafloxacin and for 
sole oral treatment of CAP. 
The clinical support for this indication mainly includes one pivotal Phase 3 study (ML-3341-306). In addition, 
results of a phase 2b study were provided as supportive data (M01-344). 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
Study M01-344 was a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, Phase II study to determine the safety and 
efficacy of a 7-day course of oral delafloxacin in subjects with CAP. Subjects were randomized to 1 of 3 
dosing groups: 100, 200, or 400 mg of delafloxacin once daily for 7 days. 
Study M01-344 was investigated between 18 March 2002 and 29 November 2002 in 58 sites. 
The summary of study design is shown in the Table 48 below.

The primary efficacy variable for statistical analysis was the clinical cure rate at TOC. The clinical cure rate 
was defined as the percent of subjects who had a clinical response of cure. 
Seven to 21 days post-treatment was used as the TOC window for clinically evaluable and clinically and 
bacteriologically evaluable analyses. Seven days post-treatment and greater were used as the TOC window 
in the ITT analyses. 
This study was not powered to test dose-response trends. 
The numbers of subjects randomized into the 100-, 200-, and 400-mg groups were 110, 93, and 106 
subjects. A total of 92, 83, and 97 subjects, respectively, were included in the per-protocol clinical analyses 
of efficacy; 68, 56, and 60 subjects, respectively, were included in the ITT bacteriological analyses; and 60, 
50, and 50 subjects, respectively, were included in the clinical and bacteriological analyses. 
Overall, there were a similar percentage of male (51%) and female subjects (49%), and the mean age of 
subjects was 45.3 years (range, 18 - 82 years). The mean weight of subjects was 75.4 kg (range, 40 - 165 
kg). 
As required by the protocol, all subjects had cough and produced sputum at pretreatment (59%, 
mucopurulent; 39%, purulent; and 3%, mucoid). Other frequently reported signs and symptoms at 
pretreatment for the 3 groups combined included rales / crackling (88%), dyspnea (72%), pleuritic chest 
pain (59%), and rhonchi / wheezing (57%).

The overall pathogen eradication rate was defined as the percentage of all evaluable pretreatment 
pathogens eradicated (regardless of number of subjects). Among subjects who were clinically and 
bacteriologically evaluable, no statistically significant dose-response trend was observed in overall pathogen 
eradication rates (p = 0.150). At TOC, 91% of pathogens in the 100-mg group, 95% of pathogens in the 
200-mg group, and 97% of pathogens in the 400-mg group were eradicated. 
Among clinically and bacteriologically evaluable subjects, no statistically significant dose-response trend 
was observed in overall pathogen eradication rates in subjects with 1 target pathogen (p = 0.063) or 
subjects with multiple target pathogens (p = 0.758). Among subjects with 1 target pathogen, 84% of 
pathogens in the 100-mg group, 97% of pathogens in the 200-mg group, and 95% of pathogens in the 
400-mg group were eradicated at TOC. Among subjects with multiple target pathogens, 100% of pathogens

in the 100-mg group, 92% of pathogens in the 200-mg group, and 100% of pathogens in the 400-mg group 
were eradicated at TOC. No statistically significant pairwise differences were observed in overall pathogen 
eradication rates or eradication rates for any individual target pathogen among subjects with 1 or multiple 
target pathogens.

Title of Study 
Study ML-3341-306 was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, comparator-controlled study to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous to oral delafloxacin in adult subjects with 
community-acquired bacterial pneumonia.  
Study ML-3341-306 was investigated between 14 December 2016 and 07 August 2018 in 88 sites (sites in 
Europe were located in Bulgaria (4), Georgia (5), Germany (2), Hungary (3), Latvia (4), Poland (3), Romania 
(6), Serbia (9), Slovenia (2), Spain (5) and Ukraine (11)).

a At local Investigator discretion, subjects in the moxifloxacin arm with confirmed MRSA, in place of remaining 
moxifloxacin doses, could receive 600 mg of linezolid administered as a 1-hour IV infusion every 12 (±2) hours for the 
remaining doses. 
Methods 
Subjects who consented to the study had screening procedures performed. Subjects were evaluated for 
baseline characteristics that included chest radiography within 48 hours before the first dose of study drug, 
and medical history, physical examination, clinical laboratory tests, and blood cultures within 24 hours 
before the first dose of study drug. A pre-treatment respiratory specimen was collected for Gram stain and 
culture and, if positive for a respiratory pathogen, susceptibility testing. The following were obtained at Day 
1: blood samples for procalcitonin and serology, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs for culture and 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, and urine samples for antigen testing. Subjects could enrol and 
start study drug before any results of the baseline pathogen identification were known. 
Respiratory and blood specimens were sent to local, regional, or specialty laboratories for culture, 
microorganism identification, and antibiotic sensitivity testing and were processed according to standard 
recognized methods. Two Gram stain slides of each sputum specimen were prepared by the local or regional 
laboratories. One slide was stained and read locally. Both slides, read and unread, were sent to the central 
laboratory to confirm results. An additional Gram stain slide could be retained by the local microbiology 
laboratory, if required by local regulations. 
Study participants 
Eligible patients in pivotal study ML-3341-306 were male or female ≥18 years of age with clinical and 
radiographic evidence of CABP and a PORT Risk Class of II, III, IV and V (pneumonia severity index score 
[PSI]>50). 
Main inclusion criteria were as follows: 
To be enrolled into the study, subjects met all the following criteria at Screening: 
•  Male and female subjects 18 years of age or older.

preferred; single view acceptable if conclusive] or computed tomography [CT] of thorax), as per 
local standard of care, within 48 hours before the first dose of study drug. 
•  PORT Risk Class II, III, IV, or V (PSI score > 50).9 Subjects could be initially prescreened if they had 
a CURB-65 score of 2 to 4. PORT Risk Class II was limited to no more than 25% of randomized 
subjects. 
• 
Females of childbearing potential (including females < 2 years postmenopausal) had to have a 
negative pregnancy test before enrolment. Sexually active women and men with partners of

Investigator (e.g., abstinence, oral contraceptives, double-barrier methods, hormonal injectable, 
transdermal, or implanted contraceptives, tubal ligation, or vasectomy) during participation in the 
study through FU (Day 28). During the study and through FU (Day 28), female partners of male 
subjects were also to use an additional reliable method of contraception, such as spermicide with 
male or female condoms; cervical sponge; intrauterine device; cervical cap or diaphragm; or oral, 
implantable, transdermal, or injectable contraceptives. 
Main exclusion criteria were as follows:

  The subject received 1 dose of a single, potentially effective, short-acting antimicrobial drug or 
a short-acting antimicrobial drug regimen for treatment of the CABP under study within 24 hours 
of enrolment. (Note: 1 dose of a regimen was defined as the standard therapy for CABP at the 
study site.) Subjects who received prior antimicrobial drug under this criterion were limited to no 
more than 25% of total randomized subjects. 
•  Respiratory infection confirmed or suspected to be secondary to hospital-acquired or

Subjects who met the entry criteria were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive delafloxacin or 
moxifloxacin. Randomization was stratified by PORT Risk Class, medical history of chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, and prior single dose/regimen systemic antimicrobial use. Enrolment 
was limited to no more than 25% of subjects who were PORT Risk Class II, and no more than 25% of 
subjects who received 1 dose of a single, potentially effective, short-acting antimicrobial drug or drug 
regimen for treatment of the CABP under study within 24 hours of enrolment. 
Treatments 
Subjects were randomized to receive either delafloxacin or moxifloxacin as follows: 
•  Delafloxacin 300 mg was administered as a 1-hour IV infusion BID (± 2 hours) for a minimum of 6 
doses, with an option to switch to delafloxacin, 450 mg tablet, administered orally BID (± 2 hours) 
for the remaining doses. 
•  Moxifloxacin 400 mg was administered as a 1-hour IV infusion every 24 (± 2) hours for a minimum 
of 3 active doses, with an option to switch to moxifloxacin 400 mg (over-encapsulated tablet) 
administered orally every 24 (± 2) hours for the remaining doses. 
•  At local Investigator discretion, subjects in the moxifloxacin arm with confirmed MRSA, in place of 
remaining moxifloxacin doses, could receive 600 mg of linezolid administered as a 1-hour IV infusion 
every 12 (± 2) hours for the remaining doses. 
The total duration of treatment (IV and oral) was from 5 days up to 10 days, as clinically indicated. 
Allowed concomitant treatment 
As with other quinolones, concurrent administration of oral delafloxacin and moxifloxacin with magnesium, 
aluminum, or calcium antacids, with metal cations such as iron or multivitamin preparations containing zinc, 
or with didanosine chewable or buffered tablets was to be avoided. The study drug was to be taken 4 hours 
before or 8 hours after taking these food supplements or medicinal products. 
EMA/226278/2021 
Page 82/144 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Systemic steroid use during the treatment period was allowed for a short duration (e.g., steroid burst). 
Inhaled steroids were allowed without any restriction. 
Any concomitant medication deemed necessary for the welfare of the subject during the study could be 
given at the discretion of the Investigator. However, it was the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to 
ensure that details regarding the medication were recorded completely in the source records and in the 
eCRF. 
Prohibited medications and restrictions 
Concurrent systemic antimicrobial treatments were prohibited. Any subject who required additional (i.e., 
nonstudy) antibiotics for any of the following reasons was considered a treatment failure: lack of efficacy 
after at least 4 doses of study drug by the end of Day 3, antibiotic therapy required for more than 20 
delafloxacin/delafloxacin placebo doses. Study drug was stopped for all treatment failures, and the subject 
completed EOT procedures. 
Subjects could not take other investigational products during the study. 
Refer to the moxifloxacin and/or linezolid SmPC or prescribing information for additional prohibited 
medications and restrictions, including but not limited to, contraindications for the concomitant use of MAO 
A or B inhibitor agents and adrenergic and serotonergic agents with linezolid. 
Objectives 
This study was designed with primary objectives intended to satisfy both FDA and EMA guidance 
recommendations. The primary and secondary objectives for submission to the EMA are as follows: 
Primary objective 
•  To assess the clinical efficacy of IV to oral delafloxacin in adult subjects with CABP at 5 to 10 days 
after the last dose of study drug (Test of Cure [TOC]) compared to IV to oral comparator study drug 
arm in the modified intent-to-treat (ModITT) and modified clinically evaluable (ModCE) populations. 
Secondary objectives 
•  To assess the clinical efficacy of IV to oral delafloxacin in adult subjects with CABP based on ECR, 
defined as improvement at 96 hours (± 24 hours) after the first dose of study drug compared to IV 
to oral moxifloxacin in the ModITT and ModCE populations. 
•  To assess the clinical efficacy of IV to oral delafloxacin in adult subjects with CABP at TOC compared 
with IV to oral moxifloxacin in the modified microbiological intent to treat (ModMITT) and modified 
microbiologically evaluable (ModME) populations.

ModME populations. 
•  To assess the safety and tolerability of IV to oral delafloxacin in adult subjects with CABP in Safety 
population. 
•  To assess the all-cause mortality in adult subjects with CABP on Day 28 in ModITT. 
•  To assess delafloxacin PK in adult subjects with CABP in PK population. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
EMA/226278/2021 
Page 83/144 
 
 
 
 
  
The primary efficacy endpoint for the EMA was Clinical Outcome at Test of Cure (TOC) in the modified 
intent-to-treat (ModITT) and modified clinically evaluable (ModCE) population evaluated 5 to 10 days after 
last dose. 
The Investigator defined the clinical outcome based on the assessment of the subject’s signs and symptoms 
of infection at End of Treatment (EOT) and TOC. The Investigator’s assessment of clinical response was 
categorized as success, failure, or indeterminate / missing, as follows: 
Success: Resolution or near resolution of the symptoms of CAP present at study entry, and no use of 
additional antimicrobial therapy for the current infection, and no new symptoms associated with the current 
CAP infection. 
Failure: Symptoms of CAP present at study entry had not resolved, new symptoms of CAP had developed, 
the subject died from pneumonia, or use of additional nonstudy antimicrobial therapy for treatment of the 
current CAP infection due to lack of efficacy. Failure outcome due to lack of efficacy was carried forward to 
later time points if the subject discontinued the trial for lack of efficacy. Subjects had to receive at least 4 
doses of study drug by the end of Day 3 to be called a failure. 
Indeterminate/Missing: A response could not be determined because an efficacy assessment was not 
completed at the visit or subject did not complete the planned course of study therapy for reasons other than 
lack of efficacy. Indeterminate/missing responses were considered failures for purposes of the analyses in 
the ModITT population and were excluded from analyses in the ModCE and modified microbiologically 
evaluable (ME) populations. 
The primary endpoint was also analysed in several subgroups, including: 
•  Age categories (age < 65 years, ≥ 65 years, ≥ 75 years); 
•  Sex; 
•  Body mass index (BMI) categories (BMI < 30 kg/m2 and ≥ 30 kg/m2); 
•  Baseline PORT Risk Class (III, IV, or V); 
•  Baseline CURB-65 score (0 - 5); 
•  Ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino, not Hispanic or Latino, or not applicable); 
•  Region (Europe, Latin America, North America, and South Africa); 
•  Race (American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, black or African American, native Hawaiian or other 
Pacific Islander, white, not applicable, or other); 
•  Prior  systemic  antibiotic  use  and  the  further  subcategories  of  subjects  with  documented  failure 
before randomization and subjects with a single dose / regimen of a prior antibiotic; 
•  Presence  or  absence  of  baseline  bacteremia,  multilobar  pneumonia,  diabetes,  history  of  chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, history of infectious hepatitis, renal impairment / 
disease based on creatinine clearance (CrCl), baseline nursing home status / hospitalization in last 
90 days, and baseline Gram stain adequacy (yes or no) ; 
•  Baseline procalcitonin level (≥ 0.15 µg/L, ≥ 0.25 µg/L, ≥ 1 µg/L); 
•  Baseline pathogen; 
•  Monomicrobial versus polymicrobial infection; 
•  System Organ Class (SOC) of Cardiac Disease; 
EMA/226278/2021 
Page 84/144 
 
 
 
 
  
 
•  SOC of Vascular Disease; 
•  SOC of Cardiac or Vascular Disease 
These subgroup analyses were performed using the ModITT population. Analyses of clinical outcome at TOC 
by  pathogen  and  monomicrobial  /  polymicrobial  infections  were  performed  for  the  ModMITT-1  and 
ModME-1TOC populations. 
Secondary efficacy analysis 
Secondary efficacy analyses for the EMA included ECR (the primary efficacy endpoint for the FDA), ECR with 
improvement of vital signs, clinical outcome at EOT, per subject microbiological response at TOC, per 
pathogen microbiological response at TOC, superinfections, new infections, postbaseline colonization, and 
Day 28 mortality. 
Microbiological Efficacy Response Definitions 
The following by-pathogen microbiological responses were defined for baseline pathogens: 
Eradication: The respiratory and / or blood specimen at TOC showed the pathogen(s) present at enrollment 
was eradicated and there was no use of additional antimicrobial therapy for the current infection. 
Investigator-assessed clinical outcome was not considered a determining factor for this microbiological 
response definition. 
Presumed Eradication: No respiratory and / or blood specimen was available at TOC with a clinical 
assessment of success. 
Persistence: The respiratory and / or blood specimen collected at TOC was positive for the causative 
pathogen(s) present at enrollment. Persistence of the baseline pathogen at EOT was carried forward to TOC. 
Investigator-assessed clinical outcome was not considered a determining factor for this microbiological 
response definition. 
Presumed Persistence: No respiratory or blood specimen was available for a case classified as clinical 
failure (including failures carried forward to TOC). 
Indeterminate / Missing: No respiratory or blood specimen was available at TOC with a clinical 
assessment of indeterminate / missing, unless there was evidence of persistence of the baseline pathogen at 
EOT (carried forward to TOC). 
Analysis Set Description 
Modified Intent-to-Treat (ModITT) Population 
The ModITT population comprised all randomized subjects who signed informed consent form (ICF), 
received at least 1 dose of study drug and were classified as PORT Risk Class III through V. Subjects were 
analyzed according to the treatment arm to which they were randomized. 
Modified Microbiological Intent-to-Treat (ModMITT) Population 
The ModMITT population comprised all subjects in the ModITT population who had a baseline bacterial 
pathogen identified, either by culture of a respiratory or blood specimen(s) or a nonculture method of 
detection (i.e., urinary antigen test, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or serologic testing) that was known 
to cause CAP and against which the study drug had antibacterial activity. 
The ModMITT was divided into the following 2 subgroups: 
EMA/226278/2021 
Page 85/144 
 
 
 
 
  
 
•  ModMITT-1: baseline pathogens detected by all methods (i.e., including culture, serology, PCR, and 
urinary antigen). All microbiological analyses based on ModMITT-1 were displayed for all pathogens, 
as well as definite and probable pathogens (see ML-3341-306, Table 11). 
•  ModMITT-2: baseline pathogens isolated by culture only (blood or any respiratory source, including 
organisms cultured from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs (S. pneumoniae or M. 
pneumoniae)). For S. pneumoniae from nasopharyngeal swabs, there had to be a concomitant lytA 
PCR value of ≥ 1000 gene copies per mL. 
Modified Clinically Evaluable (ModCE) Populations 
There were 3 ModCE populations, each based on the type of assessment (clinical response based on the 
clinical signs and symptoms of CAP and the Investigator-assessed clinical outcome) and timing of the 
assessment, including ECR (96 (± 24) hours), EOT (same day or up to 28 hours after the last dose of study 
drug), and TOC (5 - 10 days after the last dose of the study drug). 
Subjects in the ModCE populations were analyzed according to the treatment they were assigned at 
randomization. Subjects had to receive at least 4 doses of study drug by the end of Day 3 to be classified as 
a clinical failure / nonresponder. Subjects who received both study therapies or received less than 4 doses 
were excluded from the ModCE populations. Subjects with indeterminate / missing values (including out of 
window assessments) were excluded from the ModCE populations. 
Modified Microbiologically Evaluable (ModME) Populations 
The ModME populations each consisted of all subjects in the ModMITT populations who also met the criteria 
for the corresponding ModCE (ModCE-ECR, ModCE-EOT, ModCE-TOC) population as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
ModME-ECR: microbiologically evaluable at 96 (± 24) hours for ECR 
ModME-EOT: microbiologically evaluable at EOT for clinical outcome 
ModME-TOC: microbiologically evaluable at TOC for clinical outcome 
Sample size 
At least 860 adult male and female subjects (430 subjects per treatment group) were to be randomized. 
Used on a normal approximation approach (Miettinen and Nurminen’s Likelihood Score Test), and assuming 
approximately 12% of patients would be in Pneumonia Patient Outcomes Research Team (PORT) Class II, 
and 80% of patients would be clinically evaluable, 755 subjects in the modified intent-to-treat (ModITT) 
population and 604 subjects in the modified clinically evaluable (ModCE) population would provide, 
respectively, a power of 91% and 83% to assess noninferiority of delafloxacin vs. moxifloxacin based on the 
following assumptions: (1) a rate of Clinical Outcome at the TOC visit for moxifloxacin and delafloxacin of 
88% and 86%, respectively; (2) 1-sided type I error (α) of 0.025; (3) a noninferiority margin of 10%. 
Randomisation 
Patients who met all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria were randomly assigned to 1 
of 2 treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio to receive either delafloxacin or moxifloxacin. 
Randomization was stratified by PORT Risk Class, medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD) or asthma, and prior single dose/regimen systemic antimicrobial use. Enrolment was limited to no 
more than 25% of subjects who were PORT Risk Class II, and no more than 25% of subjects who received 
EMA/226278/2021 
Page 86/144 
 
 
 
 
  
 
1 dose of a single, potentially effective, short-acting antimicrobial drug or drug regimen for treatment of the 
CABP under study within 24 hours of enrolment. 
Blinding (masking) 
Most involved parties in this study (subjects, Investigators, laboratories, contract research organizations 
(CROs), and Sponsor personnel) were blinded to the identity of study drug and randomization assignments 
until the study was formally unblinded. Unblinding occurred after all subjects had completed the study and 
after resolution of all data queries. Each site documented a blinding plan before the study started. 
The pharmacist was not blinded; the pharmacist covered all IV infusion bags and tubing so that the 
identification of the study drug solution was not seen by the blinded study staff or study subjects. Certain 
clinical research staff were not blinded so that they could monitor the pharmacy, administer study drug (if 
applicable), and monitor study administration records; they did not reveal a subject’s treatment assignment 
to study staff. The statistician who created the randomization code was not otherwise involved in the 
conduct of the study. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis sets 
Analysis  sets  are  described  in  Outcomes/Endpoints  section  above.  The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  for  the 
EMA, clinical outcome at TOC, was analyzed in the ModITT and ModCE-TOC populations. In these analyses, 
subjects  with  indeterminate/missing  assessments  were  treated  as  failures  (ModITT)  or  excluded 
(ModCE-TOC). 
Primary analysis 
The primary efficacy endpoint for the EMA was investigator-assessed Clinical Outcome at Test of Cure (TOC, 
5 to 10 days after last dose), based on the assessment of the subject’s signs and symptoms of infection at 
End of Treatment (EOT) and TOC. Levels of the endpoint were classified as success, failure, or 
indeterminate/missing. 
Clinical outcome rate was defined as success= success / (success + failure). The null (H0) and alternative 
(Ha) hypotheses to be tested in order to establish the non-inferiority of delafloxacin were: 
H0: Pd – Pm ≤ -0.10 
Ha: Pd – Pm > -0.10 
The difference (delafloxacin – moxifloxacin) in response rate and the treatment comparison using the 
2-sided 95% CI on the difference in response rate stratified by baseline PORT Rick Class, medical history of 
COPD or asthma, and prior receipt of systemic antimicrobials using the Miettinen-Nurminen test were 
presented. This analysis was performed using the ModITT and ModCE-TOC populations. 
Secondary analyses 
Secondary analyses for the EMA comprised the primary efficacy FDA endpoint ECR, ECR with improvement 
of vital signs, clinical outcome at EOT, per subject microbiological response at TOC, per pathogen 
microbiological response at TOC, superinfections, new infections, postbaseline colonization, and Day 28 
mortality. 
Sensitivity analysis 
EMA/226278/2021 
Page 87/144 
 
 
 
 
  
Sensitivity analyses of primary EMA endpoints were performed to investigate the robustness of the primary 
efficacy results (overall and for each region): 
• The primary analysis without stratification using the Miettinen-Nurminen test. 
• The primary analysis, without stratification, performed on the ModMITT and modified microbiologically 
evaluable at TOC for clinical outcome (ModME-TOC) analysis populations. 
• to assess influence of age, the primary endpoint with stratification, age categories <65 years and ≥65 
years were used as additional factor. 
Multiplicity 
If non-inferiority of delafloxacin was declared in the primary analysis, the secondary endpoints were to be 
tested for non-inferiority, with the possibility of establishing a switch to superiority in the ModITT, ModCE, 
ModMITT, and ModME analysis populations. 
Subgroups analysis 
Assessment homogeneity of efficacy across subgroups was undertaken by constructing two-sided 95% CIs 
for the treatment groups’ differences in rates of the primary efficacy endpoint, similar to the primary efficacy 
analysis using the nonstratified Miettinen and Nurminen method. If there were large imbalances between 
treatment groups in these subgroups, further exploration was to be performed as an adjusted analysis of the 
primary outcome. Subgroup factors are detailed in the Outcomes/Endpoints section above.

Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
There were 3 amendments to the original study protocol (dated 03 September 2015): Amendment 1 was 
dated 15 December 2015, Amendment 2 was dated 29 March 2016, and Amendment 3 was dated 04 
December 2017. The amendments went into effect at each clinical site after approval by the IEC or IRB. The 
protocol and amendments were provided by the MAH. 
Significant protocol deviations 
In the following table (Table 53) the number of patients with significant protocol deviations in the ModITT 
population are outlined. 
Table 53 Subjects With Significant Protocol Deviations (ModITT Population) 
The primary inclusion or exclusion deviation applied to Exclusion Criterion 12; per this criterion, subjects 
were not to have uncorrected hypokalemia, which was strictly defined as any result outside of the normal 
laboratory reference range based on local laboratory testing, whether or not deemed clinically significant by 
the Investigator. However, 13 of 17 subjects in the delafloxacin group and 14 of 19 subjects in the 
moxifloxacin group had either low levels of potassium, as determined by the local laboratory, or the test was 
not performed by the local laboratory or results not received, prior to randomization. 
Of the 13 subjects with a hypokalemia (Exclusion Criterion 12) deviation in the delafloxacin group, 5 had 
potassium levels that were not available prior to randomization, but once obtained (locally or centrally), 
levels were within the reference range; and for the remaining subjects where local levels were reported, 4 
had screening potassium result from the central laboratory that was within the reference range, 1 was 
missing a screening potassium result from the central laboratory, and 3 had central laboratory screening 
potassium levels ranging from 2.8 to 3.3 (reference range, 3.4-5.4 mmol/L). 
Of the 14 subjects with an Exclusion Criterion 12 deviation in the moxifloxacin group, 3 had potassium levels 
that were not available prior to randomization, but once obtained (locally or centrally), levels were within the 
reference range; and for the remaining subjects where local levels were reported, 4 had a screening 
potassium result from the central laboratory that was within the reference range, 1 was missing a screening 
EMA/226278/2021

potassium result from the central laboratory, and 6 had central laboratory screening potassium levels 
ranging from 2.6 to 3.3 (reference range, 3.4-5.4 mmol/L). 
Days between time points 
For most subjects in the ModITT population, the number of days between EOT and TOC ranged from 5 to 8 
(see Table 54). In the delafloxacin and moxifloxacin groups, 2 and 5 subjects, respectively, had > 10 days 
between visits.

Concomitant antibacterial medications 
A number of subjects in the ModITT population received at least 1 concomitant antibacterial medication from 
start of study drug through EOT (3.9% (29 subjects)) or from EOT through follow-up (FU) (7.9% (59 
subjects)). The treatment groups were similar with regard to the percentage of subjects who received 
concomitant antibacterial medications at both time points. 
Reasons for receipt of concomitant antibiotics included treatment of the primary study condition (CAP) due 
to lack of therapeutic efficacy, prophylactic/nontherapeutic use, adverse event, and other. A similar number 
of subjects in each treatment group received a systemic antibiotic that potentially confounded the 
assessment of clinical response and therefore were excluded from the ModCE-TOC population (2 in the 
delafloxacin group and 2 in the moxifloxacin group). 
Study drug exposure 
In Study ML-3341-306, the mean duration of exposure for the delafloxacin and moxifloxacin groups was 
similar (8.4 days and 8.5 days, respectively). For both treatment groups, the median total exposure was 9.0 
days, with 6.0 days for IV exposure and 2.0 days for oral exposure. For most subjects (59.2% in the 
delafloxacin group and 62.3% in the moxifloxacin group), exposure was > 8 to 10 days. The median number 
of IV doses was 12.0 in both treatment groups.

Based on these data non-inferiority of delafloxacin to moxifloxacin has been demonstrated.  
The reasons for clinical failure at TOC visit were generally well balanced between treatment groups in the 
study. 
Results from additional populations at TOC are in accordance with the primary analysis. Regardless of the 
analysis population, success rates were comparable between treatment groups. Sensitivity analysis support 
that treatment of CAP with delafloxacin is non-inferior to treatment with moxifloxacin.

Per-pathogen microbiological response at test of cure by most common baseline pathogens (in > 5 subjects) 
The rates of microbiological success by pathogen at TOC were similar between the delafloxacin group and 
moxifloxacin group for the most common pathogens. 
Two patients in the delafloxacin group and three patients in the moxifloxacin group had documented 
persistence. In the delafloxacin group persistent pathogens included S. pneumoniae (1 patient) and H. 
parainfluenzae (1 patient). Each of these pathogens was confirmed as being genetically related to the 
baseline isolate by multilocus sequence typing or pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Nonetheless, each 
of these 2 subjects had a clinical outcome of success at EOT and TOC as assessed by the investigator.

Superinfections and new infections 
In the ModITT population, 4 subjects (3 subjects in the delafloxacin group and 1 subject in the  moxifloxacin 
group) had a superinfection (i.e., a new pathogen, cultured during treatment, that caused respiratory 
infection and was associated with clinical failure). Causative pathogens were E. coli, H. parainfluenzae, and 
Serratia liquefaciens complex in the delafloxacin group; and E. cloacae complex in the moxifloxacin group. 
No subject in either treatment group had a new infection (i.e., a new pathogen, cultured after treatment that 
caused respiratory infection and was associated with clinical failure). 
Day 28 mortality 
A similar percentage of ModITT subjects in the delafloxacin (2.1% (8 of 376)) and moxifloxacin groups 
(1.6% (6 of 370)) died during the study (up to Day 28). Using a Cox proportional hazards regression model 
that adjusted for stratification factors (baseline PORT Risk Class, history of COPD or asthma, and prior 
systemic antimicrobial use), the hazard ratio for all-cause mortality between delafloxacin and moxifloxacin 
was 1.516 (95% CI, 0.514 to 4.470). 
Comparison of Results in Subpopulations 
No significant differences between treatment groups were identified in subgroup analysis.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
In this EoI variation the MAH applied for the indication treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) 
in adults when it is considered inappropriate to use other antibacterial agents that are commonly 
recommended for the initial treatment of these infections. 
The clinical support for this indication mainly include one pivotal Phase 3 study (ML-3341-306). In addition, 
results of a phase 2b study were provided as supportive data (M01-344). 
For justification of dosage for the indication CAP PK/PD analysis were submitted (please see PK/PD 
Assessment).  
Design and conduct of pivotal clinical study ML-3341-306 
Study ML-3341-306 was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, comparator-controlled study to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous to oral delafloxacin in adult subjects with 
community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. 
Inclusion/exclusion criteria 
EMA/226278/2021 
Page 104/144 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria are in general in accordance with the recommendations for studies in CAP as 
outlined in the Draft AB GL (EMA/844951/2018 Rev. 3) and therefore acceptable. Patients included on the 
basis of these criteria meet the requirements for CAP. 
Randomization was stratified by PORT Risk Class, medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD) or asthma, and prior single dose/regimen systemic antimicrobial use. Enrolment was limited to no 
more than 25% of subjects who were PORT Risk Class II, and no more than 25% of subjects who received 
one dose of a single, potentially effective, short-acting antimicrobial drug or drug regimen for treatment of 
the CABP under study within 24 hours of enrolment. 
According to the Draft AB GL when treatment is to be initiated by the intravenous route patients should have 
a minimum PORT score of III and at least 25% should have a score >III. Even if patients were included with 
PORT score II, this recommendation was considered for primary analysis.   
Patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl of <30 mL/min) were excluded from pivotal study. The applied 
dosage for patients with severe renal impairment and the indication CAP is 200 mg intravenously/450 mg 
oral delafloxacin every 12 hours which is in line with the approved dosage in ABSSSI.  
Treatments 
Study ML-3341-306 investigated 300 mg delafloxacin administered as an 1-hour IV infusion BID (± 2 hours) 
for a minimum of 6 doses, with an option to switch to delafloxacin, 450 mg tablet, administered orally BID 
(± 2 hours) for the remaining doses. The minimum duration of treatment (IV and oral) was 5 days and the 
maximum 10 days. 
Moxifloxacin was chosen as comparator. Moxifloxacin is approved in the EU for the indication CAP as second 
line indication due to safety risk (when it is considered inappropriate to use antibacterial agents that are 
commonly recommended for the initial treatment of these infections). Dosage used for IV and oral treatment 
is in line with the approved dosage. Moxifloxacin is recommended as empiric treatment option for patients 
with CAP in respective treatment guidelines; therefore, it is acceptable as comparator. It should be 
considered that the MAH applied for the same second line indication as approved for moxifloxacin.  
According to the SmPC of moxifloxacin the recommended treatment duration of intravenous and oral 
moxifloxacin is 7 - 14 days for CAP. Nevertheless, current treatment guidelines recommend an antibiotic 
treatment duration of 5-7(10) days in case of CAP. Therefore, the treatment duration as used in study 
ML-3341-306 can be accepted. This is also supported by the fact that high cure rates were reported for both 
treatment groups. 
It was determined in the study protocol that subjects in the moxifloxacin arm with confirmed MRSA, in place 
of remaining moxifloxacin doses, could receive 600 mg of linezolid administered as a 1-hour IV infusion 
every 12 (± 2) hours for the remaining doses. Moxifloxacin is not recommended for the treatment of MRSA 
infections and using linezolid for targeted treatment in patients with confirmed MRSA is supported. Overall, 
MRSA was confirmed only in one patient in the delafloxacin group. Therefore, no patient received linezolid 
during study. 
Primary endpoint  
The study was designed with a primary objective specific to the submission to the FDA and a primary 
objective specific to the submission to the EMA and separate statistical analysis plans were employed for 
submission to the FDA and for submission to the EMA, which is supported. 
The primary EMA efficacy endpoint was Clinical Outcome at Test of Cure (TOC) evaluated 5 to 10 days after 
last dose. The analysis was performed considering the outcome of cure in the ModITT population and ModCE 
population. The ModITT population comprised all randomized subjects who signed informed consent form, 
received at least 1 dose of study drug and were classified as PORT Risk Class III through V. ModCE-TOC 
EMA/226278/2021 
Page 105/144 
 
 
 
 
  
population included subjects who received at least 4 doses of study drug by the end of Day 3 to be classified 
as a clinical failure/nonresponder. Subjects with indeterminate / missing values (including out of window 
assessments) were excluded from the ModCE-TOC population. 
The primary EP as defined is in line with the recommendations in the Draft AB GL. The selected 
non-inferiority margin (-10%) is also in line with this guideline. Since according to the Draft AB GL for a 
treatment initiation by the intravenous route patients should have a minimum PORT score of III the 
definition of primary analysis set ModITT is accepted. 
The definition of success “Resolution or near resolution of the symptoms of CAP present at study entry, and 
no use of additional antimicrobial therapy for the current infection, and no new symptoms associated with 
the current CAP infection.” is agreed. 
Statistical methods 
The design and description of methods of the pivotal study -306 is overall considered acceptable. Analyses 
were clearly specified and appropriately described. Statistical methods used for the primary analysis are 
considered adequate. Two sets of primary and secondary analyses were used with different primary 
endpoints for MAA submission at FDA and EMA, which is acceptable considering different guideline 
requirements. Non-inferiority was assessed using the Miettinen and Nurminen method and properties of the 
method are appropriate and favourable compared to other confidence interval based approaches. The 
non-inferiority margin used was chosen according to the EMA Guideline Addendum. The approach to address 
multiplicity, switching to superiority analyses for secondary endpoints after the primary analysis was 
successful, is acceptable. There was no multiplicity due to interim analysis. Missing data is not a major 
problem with a balanced distribution of missing assessments and drop-outs in both treatment arms and no 
concerns with regard to intercurrent events and reasons for missingness. Handling of missing data as 
failures or excluding observations in the main analysis populations is acceptable. Methods used for analysis 
of secondary endpoints and subgroups analysis are acceptable. 
Baseline data 
Subjects in the ModITT population were predominantly male (60.5%), white (91.6%), and European 
(85.4%); 6.7% were Hispanic or Latino. The mean age of subjects was 61.5 years (range, 18 - 93 years), 
with 48.3% of subjects ≥65 years and 23.9% of subjects ≥75 years. A slightly higher percentage of subjects 
in the delafloxacin group were ≥65 years (51.1%) compared with the moxifloxacin group (45.4%), while 
22.1% and 25.7%, respectively, were ≥75 years. A lower percentage of subjects in the delafloxacin group 
(64.9%) than subjects in the moxifloxacin group (71.1%) had an adequate Gram stain at baseline. 
Overall, 30.7% of patients had a PORT score >III which is in line with the recommendation in the Draft AB 
GL for studies in CAP initiated by intravenous route. Nevertheless, most recruited patients, despite being 
hospitalised, had CAP of rather moderate severity – 90.7% had CURB-65 score ≤2 and 69.3% were 
categorised to PORT class III. The outcome of such patients is expected to be positive in vast majority of 
cases. However, about 50% were aged >65 years and 60.3% were overweight; both being risk factors for 
more severe CAP. 
Baseline data including severity scores of the disease are in general comparable between treatment arms. 
The majority of the patients in the delafloxacin group (91.8%) and comparator group (90.8%) completed 
the study through TOC. 
The most common reason for withdrawing from study was lack of efficacy (delafloxacin 10 patients [2.7%], 
moxifloxacin 15 patients [4.1%]), AEs (delafloxacin 13 patients [3.5%], moxifloxacin 5 patients [1.4%]) 
and withdrawal by subject (delafloxacin 1 patient [0.3%], moxifloxacin 7 patients [1.9%]).  
EMA/226278/2021 
Page 106/144 
 
 
 
 
  
Some more patients discontinued study drug due to AEs in the delafloxacin group (12 patients [3.2%]) 
compared to the moxifloxacin group (moxifloxacin 5 patients [1.4%]).  
Overall, the number of subjects completing the study and reason for discontinuation was comparable 
between the two treatment arms. 
The median total exposure in the safety population in both treatment groups was 9.0 days, with 6.0 days for 
IV exposure and 2.0 days for oral exposure. Most subjects received study drug for > 8 to 10 days 
(delafloxacin group 59.2%, moxifloxacin group 62.3%).  
Efficacy data and additional analyses of pivotal clinical study ML-3341-306 
Primary EP 
Clinical response rates were high across both treatment arms. In the ModITT population the success rate at 
TOC  was  91.0%  in  the  delafloxacin  group  and  89.2%  in  the  moxifloxacin  group.  The  lower  limit  of  the 
two-sided 95% confidence interval was above the pre-specified margin -10% (95% CI −3.2, 5.5). 
In the ModCE-TOC population the success rate at TOC was 94.8% in the delafloxacin group and 93.8% in the 
moxifloxacin group. The lower limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval was above the pre-specified 
margin -10% (95% CI −2.5, 4.6). 
Based on these data non-inferiority of delafloxacin to moxifloxacin has been demonstrated (IV followed by 
oral treatment).  
The reasons for clinical failure at TOC visit were generally well balanced between treatment groups in the 
study. 
Results from additional populations at TOC are in accordance with the primary analysis. Regardless of the 
analysis  population,  success  rates  were  comparable  between  treatment  groups.  Sensitivity  analysis 
supported that treatment of CAP with delafloxacin is non-inferior to treatment with moxifloxacin. 
Additional analysis 
The rates of microbiological success by pathogen at TOC were similar between the delafloxacin group and 
moxifloxacin group for the most common pathogens. 
Two  patients  in  the  delafloxacin  group  and  three  patients  in  the  moxifloxacin  group  had  documented 
persistence.  In  the  delafloxacin  group  persistent  pathogens  included  S.  pneumoniae  (1  patient)  and  H. 
parainfluenzae  (1  patient).  Each  of  these  pathogens  was  confirmed  as  being  genetically  related  to  the 
baseline isolate by multilocus sequence typing or pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Nonetheless, each 
of these 2 subjects had a clinical outcome of success at EOT and TOC as assessed by the investigator.  
Regards to mortality a comparable percentage of ModITT patients died during study up to day 28. For further 
discussion of death cases please see safety assessment. 
Subgroup analysis 
In subgroup analysis no significant differences between treatment groups were identified, although small 
absolute numbers in some of these groups precludes any robust conclusions. 
Phase 2b study M01-344 
This double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, Phase 2b study investigated the safety and efficacy of a 
7-day course of oral delafloxacin (3 dosing groups: 100, 200, or 400 mg once daily) in subjects with CAP. 
EMA/226278/2021 
Page 107/144 
 
 
 
 
  
 
The aim of this study performed in 2002 was to help to identify the optimal dose regimen for future studies. 
The oral dosages used in this study are not in line with the oral dosage applied for the indication CAP (450 
mg oral twice daily). Furthermore, an older capsule formulation was used in this study.  
Overall, no statistically significant dose-response trends in clinical response, and no statistically significant 
pairwise differences were observed between treatment groups among clinically evaluable, ITT, or clinically 
and bacteriologically evaluable subjects. All 3 doses were effective in resolving or improving clinical signs 
and symptoms of CAP, eradicating the target pathogens, and resolving or improving radiographic evidence 
of pneumonia. The 200-mg dose appeared to be similar to the 400-mg dose in clinical cure rates, 
bacteriological cure rates, and overall pathogen-eradication rates. However, lower clinical cure rates, 
bacteriological cure rates, and overall pathogen eradication rates were observed in the 100-mg group. 
Regards to the application for extension of indication this Phase 2b study is of only some relevance since the 
study was not powered to test dose-response trends, the dosage applied for was not investigated, the used 
oral formulation is not in line with the approved one and the study was investigated in 2002, which question 
the validity of results.

2.4.1.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The clinical support for this indication mainly includes one pivotal Phase 3 study (ML-3341-306). In addition, 
results of a phase 2b study were provided as supportive data (M01-344). Furthermore, in phase 1 study 
ML-3341-119 intrapulmonary disposition of delafloxacin was investigated and dosage was justified by 
respective PK/PD analysis. 
In general, the patient population included in pivotal study ML-3341-306 is considered to be representative 
for the applied indication. Non-inferiority of delafloxacin to moxifloxacin has been clearly demonstrated in 
these patients for the primary endpoints.  
Pivotal study ML-3341-306 investigated IV followed by oral delafloxacin. Regards to sole oral delafloxacin 
treatment of CAP it should be considered that in the frame of the initial MAA a BE study was submitted which 
revealed that 300 mg IV delafloxacin and 450 mg oral delafloxacin can be regarded as bioequivalent. 
Therefore, results of pivotal study ML-3341-306 can be extrapolated to sole oral treatment with delafloxacin. 
It can be concluded that the extension of indication meets the prerequisites for one pivotal study application, 
as detailed in EMA Points to consider on application with 1. Meta-analyses; 2. One pivotal study 
(CPMP/EWP/2330/99, 31 May 2001). The pharmacological principle and mechanism of action is established. 
A robust clinical data package has been provided. Data from Study ML-3341-306 can be regarded as valid in 
relation to the indication applied for. According to the EMA Points to consider on application with 1. 
Meta-analyses; 2. One pivotal study (CPMP/EWP/2330/99, 31 May 2001), when the aim is to demonstrate 
non-inferiority, one study is more likely to be accepted if the lower 95% confidence bound is well away from 
the non-inferiority margin. In Study ML-3341-306 the lower bound of 95% confidence interval was -3,2% 
and therefore well away from the non-inferiority margin of -10%. Furthermore, the results of Study 
EMA/226278/2021 
Page 108/144 
 
 
 
 
  
 
ML-3341-306 support internal consistency of the data set. In addition, patients in Study ML-3341-306 were 
enrolled across a large number of clinical centres, without dominance of any given centre. 
Overall, pivotal study ML-3341-306 provides robust efficacy results and one pivotal study application is 
agreed. Furthermore, efficacy data are supported by PK/PD analysis of pathogens most relevant for CAP (S. 
pneumoniae, S. aureus and H. influenzae). 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The Summary of Clinical Safety (SCS) includes safety data from Phase III ML-3341-306 in subjects with 
CAP. Two additional studies in support of the CAP indication (1 Phase I study (ML-3341-119) and 1 Phase II 
study (M01-344)) as well as safety data from the initial ABSSSI MAA are described. Post-marketing data are 
provided.  
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) were selected based on medical issues of interest for the 
fluoroquinolone class of antibiotics: potential myopathy, Clostridioides difficile diarrhoea, convulsions, 
potential peripheral neuropathy, potential tendon disorder, potential QT prolongation, potential 
phototoxicity, potential allergic reactions, potential dysglycaemias (hyperglycaemia, hypoglycaemia), 
hepatic-related events, and aortic aneurysm dissection / rupture. It also included other potential 
neurological and psychiatric AEs, reflecting the EMA review (EMEA/175398/2019, November 2018). 
Initial ABSSSI Safety Population  
Multiple-Dose ABSSSI safety population 
The Multiple-Dose ABSSSI population included 1840 subjects from 4 completed Phase II (RX-3341-201 and 
RX-3341-202) and Phase III studies (RX-3341-302 and RX-3341-303) (Section 4 - Multiple-Dose ABSSSI 
Safety Population in Module 2.7.4). Subject demographics were generally similar between the delafloxacin 
and comparator (vancomycin-aztreonam, linezolid, tigecycline) groups. Subjects ranged from 18 to 94 
years of age with a mean of 48.0 years in the delafloxacin group and 47.2 years in the comparator group. In 
both treatment groups, most subjects were male (> 60%) and white (> 84%) and had a mean BMI of 
approximately 30 kg/m2. In both treatment groups, approximately 11% of subjects had diabetes and 16% 
had baseline renal impairment (CrCl based on Cockcroft-Gault formula). In the delafloxacin group, 26.8% of 
subjects had a history of hepatitis B or C compared with 23.8% in the comparator group. Approximately 
70% of subjects were from North America. 
Overall, 12.9% of subjects treated with delafloxacin withdrew from the studies compared with 15.4% of 
subjects treated with comparators. The most common reason for withdrawal from study was subjects lost to 
follow-up (6.6% in the delafloxacin group and 7.2% in the comparator group). Overall, 1.3% of subjects 
treated with delafloxacin withdrew from the study drug because of an AE compared with 3.2% of subjects 
treated with comparators. Refer to ABSSSI MAA Section 2.7.4.1.3.2. 
Delafloxacin was also safe and well-tolerated in the Phase II and Phase III ABSSSI studies. Fewer subjects 
had TEAEs in the delafloxacin group versus the comparator group (47.7% and 52.4%, respectively). 
Similarly, fewer subjects had treatment-related TEAEs in the delafloxacin group versus the comparator 
group (25.6% and 31.0%, respectively). Most TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity, with < 4% of 
subjects in either group experiencing severe TEAEs.

Fewer subjects had TEAEs leading to premature study drug discontinuation in the delafloxacin group versus 
the comparator group (1.6% and 3.8%, respectively). Likewise, fewer subjects had treatment-related 
TEAEs leading to premature study drug discontinuation in the delafloxacin group versus the comparator 
group (0.7% and 2.4%, respectively). 
Fewer subjects had AESI in the delafloxacin group versus the comparator group (11.1% and 14.2%, 
respectively). The AESI terms included events associated with fluoroquinolones, including liver events, 
phototoxicity, and QT prolongation. The comparator group, which did not include a fluoroquinolone, 
provided an active control reference to assess delafloxacin’s safety profile and provided context for potential 
safety signal detection. 
The incidence of SAEs was similar between treatment groups (3.7% with delafloxacin compared to 3.8% 
with comparators). There was a total of 4 TEAEs leading to death, 1 in the delafloxacin group and 3 in the 
comparator group, all of which were assessed as unrelated to the study treatment by the Investigator. 
The most common TEAEs in the delafloxacin group were nausea (9.1%), diarrhoea (8.6%), infection 
(5.2%), infusion-site extravasation (4.7%), and headache (3.5%). The incidences of specific TEAEs were 
generally comparable between delafloxacin and comparators, with the exception of a higher incidence of 
diarrhoea with delafloxacin versus the comparators (8.6% vs. 3.9%), which was driven by higher rates in 
the delafloxacin-treated subjects in Phase II studies. The incidence of gastrointestinal events with 
delafloxacin was lower in the Phase III studies compared with delafloxacin in the Phase II studies (16.9% vs. 
33.9%). Gastrointestinal events were reported at comparable rates when delafloxacin was given by IV 
(17.3%, RX-3341-302) or by IV followed by oral doses (16.8%, RX-3341-303). The oral delafloxacin doses 
were not associated with an increase in gastrointestinal events in the comparison of these 2 trials. 
Initial Phase I Safety Population  
The previously submitted pooled Phase I safety experience comprises data from 814 subjects who received 
at least 1 dose of oral or IV delafloxacin in 20 completed Phase I studies (Section 4 - Phase I Safety 
Population in Module 2.7.4). 
Delafloxacin was safe and well tolerated. There were no deaths or SAEs; 1 subject had a severe TEAE 
(dysphagia, assessed as unrelated to the study treatment by the Investigator). Few (1.5%) subjects 
experienced TEAEs leading to premature study drug discontinuation. 
The most common TEAEs were diarrhoea (13.3%), nausea (10.2%), and headache (9.3%). Vomiting 
(4.4%) and infusion-site pain (3.7%) were also noted. The integrated data suggest a greater frequency of 
gastrointestinal and infusion-related TEAEs (with IV dosing) at higher doses. 
The incidence of AESIs regardless of causality in the Phase I studies was low (7.4%). Few subjects (2.7%) 
had AESI that were considered to be treatment-related by the Investigator.

Healthy adults received 300 mg of delafloxacin intravenously (IV) every 12 hours for a total of 7 doses over 
4 days. With one exception, none of the subjects experienced an interruption in any of their infusions. 
Subject 001007 (Group D [8 hour]) experienced an interruption and resumption of infusion during the Day 
3 afternoon dose due to a burning feeling at the IV site. None of the subjects required discontinuation of any 
of their infusions. 
Adverse events 
An overall summary of AEs is shown in Table 67. Of the 30 healthy subjects enrolled, 13 subjects (43.3%) 
reported a total of 23 TEAEs, 17 of which were mild in severity and 6 of which were moderate in severity. The 
most frequently reported TEAEs overall were infusion-site phlebitis (9 subjects (30.0%)) and diarrhoea (4 
subjects (13.3%)). Discoloured faeces were reported by 2 subjects (6.7%). All other TEAEs were reported 
by 1 subject each (Table 68). 
Table 67: Overall Summary of Adverse Events (Safety Population) - ML-3341-119
Eleven subjects (36.7%) reported at least 1 delafloxacin-related TEAE (Table 69). The most commonly 
reported related TEAEs overall (by SOC) were General Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions (9 
subjects (30.0%)) and Gastrointestinal Disorders (6 subjects (20.0%)). The most common related TEAEs 
overall (by Preferred Term) were infusion-site phlebitis (9 subjects (30.0%)) and diarrhoea (4 subjects 
(13.3%)). The TEAE of discolored feces was reported by 2 subjects (6.7%). All other related TEAEs were 
reported by 1 subject each. 
One subject experienced a mild TEAE of paraesthesia, which began on Day 3 and resolved on Day 4. 
Concomitant medication was not given, and delafloxacin infusions continued uninterrupted. Paraesthesia 
was considered as possibly related by the Investigator.  
The TEAEs were mild (10 subjects (33.3%)) or moderate (3 subjects (10.0%)) in severity. Moderate TEAEs 
included infusion-site phlebitis, diarrhoea, nausea, and dehydration. No severe TEAEs were reported. There 
were no deaths, SAEs, or TEAEs leading to early discontinuation. All TEAEs resolved by the end of the study. 
There were no clinically significant findings noted or TEAEs reported from clinical laboratory assessments, 
vital sign measurements, or 12-lead ECG results. Aside from abnormalities of the skin associated with the 
EMA/226278/2021 
Page 111/144 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
TEAEs of infusion site phlebitis, infusion site swelling, and peripheral edema, no other abnormal physical 
examination finding was associated with a TEAE.

Table 69 Summary of Treatment-Related Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (Safety 
Population) – ML-3341-119 
Note: Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) is defined as any event not present before exposure to study drug or 
any event already present that worsens in intensity or frequency after exposure. A treatment-related TEAE is defined as 
a TEAE that is considered by the investigator to be possible, probable or definitely related to the study treatment. At each 
level of subject summarization, a subject is counted once for the most related event if the subject reported one or more 
events. TEAEs with a missing relationship are considered definitely related in the summary. Percentages are based on the 
number of subjects in the safety population. Adverse events were coded by system organ class and preferred term using 
MedDRA version 19.1.

2.5.2.  Safety in CAP population 
Study M01-344 (Phase IIb) 
Title: A Phase 2b Comparative Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Three Oral Doses of ABT-492 for the 
Treatment of Subjects with Community Acquired Pneumonia  
This was a Phase 2b, double-blinded, randomized, parallel-group, multi-centre study with subjects (in the 
fed state) who had a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) supported by appropriate signs and 
symptoms. At enrolment (Screening/Evaluation 1), subjects were evaluated for etiologic pathogens [Gram 
stain, culture of respiratory (sputum) specimen] and signs and symptoms of CAP. Subjects were seen for 
Evaluation 2 on Study Day 3, for Evaluation 3 on Study Days 9-10, and for Evaluation 4 (Test-of-Cure) on 
Study Days 16-21, or within 48 hours after early termination. Evaluation 5 (Study Days 37-39) consisted of 
a telephone contact for a follow-up evaluation. 
Patient exposure 
Subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive: 
• ABT-492 1 X 100 mg capsules plus 3 placebo for ABT-492 for 7 days, OR 
• ABT -492 2 X 100 mg capsules plus 2 placebo for ABT -492 for 7 days, OR 
• ABT-492 4 X 100 mg capsules QD for 7 days. 
Adverse events 
Of 309 subjects with CAP, diarrhoea was the most commonly reported TEAE in all dosing groups (Table 70). 
Statistically significant dose-response trends were observed in nausea and diarrhoea for all TEAEs. Liver 
function abnormalities showed an inverse dose dependence (less effect at increasing doses). No subjects 
died during the study. A total of 10 subjects from all dose groups had SAEs during the study, none of which 
were considered by the Investigator to be related to study drug. Of the 9 subjects who withdrew because of 
AEs, 3 subjects’ AEs were considered possibly or probably related to study drug; all were in the 100-mg 
group (1 with nausea and tendon disorder confirmed as patellar tendonitis, 1 with tendon disorder confirmed 
as Achilles tendonitis, and 1 with abdominal pain). Although the 2 subjects who withdrew because of a 
tendon disorder had pre-existing joint complaints, the Investigators considered these events possibly 
related to delafloxacin. 
No clinically meaningful changes in laboratory tests or vital signs were observed during the study.

Study ML-3341-306 (Phase III) 
Title: A phase 3, multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, comparator-controlled study to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of intravenous to oral delafloxacin in adult subjects with community-acquired bacterial 
pneumonia  
Patient exposure 
In ML-3341-306, in total 856 subjects (429 delafloxacin subjects and 427 moxifloxacin subjects) received at 
least one dose of study medication (Safety population). The mean duration of exposure for the delafloxacin 
and moxifloxacin groups was similar (8.4 days and 8.5 days, respectively). For both treatment groups, the 
median total exposure was 9.0 days, with 6.0 days for IV exposure and 2.0 days for oral exposure. For most 
subjects (59.2% in the delafloxacin group and 62.3% in the moxifloxacin group), exposure was >8 to 10 
days. A tabular overview of exposure is shown in Table 71. The median number of IV doses was 12.0 in both 
treatment groups. Subject disposition (safety population) is shown in Table 72.

Adverse events  
Overall, 131 subjects (30.5%) in the delafloxacin group and 112 subjects (26.2%) in the moxifloxacin group 
experienced a total of 215 and 204 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), respectively ( 
Table 73). Of these subjects, 65 (15.2%) in the delafloxacin group and 54 (12.6%) in the moxifloxacin group 
experienced TEAEs that were considered at least possibly related to study drug. In both treatment groups, 
most TEAEs were assessed as mild in severity; 19 subjects (4.4%) in the delafloxacin group and 14 subjects 
(3.3%) in the moxifloxacin group had TEAEs assessed as severe.

Common Adverse Events 
No TEAE was reported in ≥ 5% of subjects in either treatment group. Total TEAEs and related TEAEs (ADRs) 
reported in ≥ 1% of subjects in one or both treatment groups are shown in (Table 74). 
Pulmonary embolism was reported in 1 subject (0.2%) in the delafloxacin group and 6 subjects (1.4%) in the 
moxifloxacin group; in 1 and 4 subjects in the delafloxacin and moxifloxacin groups, respectively, the event 
was considered an SAE. Only 1 of the events was considered related to study drug (moxifloxacin) by the 
Investigator. 
In both treatment groups, about half of the TEAEs were considered related to study drug. The most common 
related TEAEs were diarrhoea (3.7% [16 subjects]) and transaminases increased (2.6% [11 subjects]) in 
the delafloxacin group and diarrhoea (3.0% [13 subjects]) and headache (2.3% [10 subjects]) in the 
moxifloxacin group (CSR End-of-Text Table 14.3.1.7).

TEAEs by Severity 
In both treatment groups, most TEAEs were assessed as either mild or moderate in severity. Severe TEAEs 
are shown in Table 75 below. 
A total of 33 subjects had 1 or more severe TEAE: 19 subjects (4.4%) in the delafloxacin group and 14 
subjects (3.3%) in the moxifloxacin group. The severe TEAEs were single events, except for septic shock and 
pneumonia (3 subjects [0.7%] each) in the delafloxacin group and cardiac failure and pulmonary embolism 
(2 subjects [0.5%] each) in the moxifloxacin group (Table 75). One subject in the moxifloxacin group had 
staphylococcal bacteremia (reported as metastatic S. aureus infection), beginning on Day 24, that was 
considered unrelated to the study drug by the Investigator. 
Sudden death was reported in a subject in the moxifloxacin group, but was considered unrelated to study 
drug upon autopsy by the investigator.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
A summary of TEAEs leading to death is provided in Table 76. Nine subjects (2.1%) in the delafloxacin group 
and 7 subjects (1.6%) in the moxifloxacin group had TEAEs leading to death. Two deaths, one in each 
treatment groups, occurred after Day 28. All events were considered unrelated to study drug. 
Of the 6 subjects in the delafloxacin treatment group who had causes of death grouped under the Infections 
and Infestations System Organ Class (SOC) (Table 76), 4 died of sepsis / septic shock. Two of the subjects, 
both diabetic, were critically ill at study entry; one, in PORT Risk Class IV, had underlying pulmonary fibrosis 
with no baseline pathogen identified, and the other, in PORT Risk Class V, was infected with both MSSA and 
S. pneumoniae. Two subjects appeared to have an intra-abdominal source for sepsis. The 2 remaining 
subjects had their deaths attributed to pneumonia. One subject in PORT Risk Class III with P. aeruginosa 
identified in his baseline sputum culture developed marked mental status changes and died of 
cardiopulmonary arrest within the first ~24 hours of the study. The other subject, also in PORT Risk Class III, 
had S. pneumoniae at baseline; he was considered a clinical success at EOT, but he developed recurrent 
symptoms by the time of the TOC Visit. The subject died the following day at another facility after being 
referred for further assessment. The cause of death entered on the death certificate was “ARDS secondary 
to COPD.”  
One patient in the delafloxacin treatment group died for unknown cause. The patient had a history of 
anemia, bicytopenia and agranulocytosis. During the study, non-serious leukopenia and neutropenia were 
recorded on Day 5. The patient was discharged from hospital on Day 7 and considered a clinical cure at the 
EOT visit on Day 12, with improvement in neutropenia compared with screening. The patient was 
re-hospitalized on Day 15 for agranulocytosis and died on Day 27 of unknown cause. Further details were not 
available. The Investigator considered the event as being not related to study drug, and the Sponsor agreed 
with this assessment.

Three subjects in the delafloxacin treatment group had SAEs of pneumonia: 2 of the 3 subjects died. The 
third subject, who had MSSA identified at baseline, responded favourably to delafloxacin therapy but 
developed recurrent fever and poor O2  saturation around Day 7; this was considered a new 
hospital-acquired infection and the patient was treated with other antibiotics. The moxifloxacin-treated 
subject with an SAE of pneumonia with baseline MSSA was discontinued after 6 doses because of disease 
progression. Follow-up cultures were not done for these 4 subjects. Narratives for these subjects can be 
found in Section 2.7.4, Appendix 2. 
Most SAEs were single events; SAEs that occurred in more than 1 subject were septic shock and pneumonia 
(3 subjects (0.7%) each) and COPD (2 subjects (0.5%)) in the delafloxacin group and pulmonary embolism 
(4 subjects (0.9%)) and cardiac failure and acute cardiac failure (2 subjects [0.5%] each) in the 
moxifloxacin group. 
Two subjects in the delafloxacin group had SAEs that were considered related to study drug by the 
Investigator. Both related SAEs resulted in discontinuation of study drug. 
Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events 
In both treatment groups, most clinical laboratory TEAEs were reported in a single subject (Table 78). In the 
delafloxacin group, clinical laboratory TEAEs reported in more than 1 subject were transaminases increased 
EMA/226278/2021

(13 subjects (3.0%)), hypokalaemia (8 subjects (1.9%)), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased (4 
subjects (0.9%)), hepatic enzyme increased, anaemia, and leukopenia (3 subjects (0.7%) each), and 
hyperglycaemia (2 subjects (0.5%)).  
In the moxifloxacin group, clinical laboratory TEAEs reported in more than 1 subject were transaminases 
increased and hyperglycaemia (6 subjects (1.4%) each), hepatic enzyme increased and hypoglycaemia (3 
subjects (0.7%) each), and ALT increased, blood creatine phosphokinase increased, anaemia, 
hypokalaemia, and leukocytosis (2 subjects (0.5%) each). 
Hypokalemia was reported in 8 subjects (1.9%) in the delafloxacin group and 2 subjects (0.5%) in the 
moxifloxacin group. Hypokalemia was assessed as mild in 8 of 10 subjects overall, and as moderate in 2 of 
8 subjects in the delafloxacin group. In all but 1 subject, hypokalemia was considered unrelated to the study 
drug by the Investigator: in 1 subject in the delafloxacin group, hypokalemia was assessed as mild and 
possibly related to study drug. Hypokalemia resolved in all subjects on or before Day 12. Five of 8 subjects 
in the delafloxacin group were receiving concomitant medications that could have played a role in their 
hypokalemia: 4 were receiving loop diuretics (furosemide, indapamide, or torasemide) and 1 subject 
received high-dose IV hydrocortisone 3 days before the hypokalemia. In all 10 subjects, hypokalemia 
resolved with drug treatment, and no subject discontinued delafloxacin because of the hypokalemia. 
In addition, 1 subject in the delafloxacin group had an AE of decreased blood potassium on Day 5 which was 
assessed as mild and unrelated by the Investigator and resolved on the same day following treatment with 
potassium chloride. 
Of the clinical laboratory TEAEs, the events that were reported as related to the study drug by the 
Investigator in more than 1 subject were transaminases increased (11 subjects (2.6%)), hepatic enzyme 
increased (3 subjects (0.7%)), and ALT increased and anemia (2 subjects (0.5%) each) in the delafloxacin 
group; and transaminases increased (4 subjects (0.9%)), hepatic enzyme increased (3 subjects (0.7%)), 
and hyperglycemia (2 subjects (0.5%)) in the moxifloxacin group.

Individual Subject Changes 
In general, mean values and changes from baseline in hematology and serum chemistry levels were similar 
across the treatment groups at all time points. There were no unexpected changes in either treatment group. 
Individual Clinically Significant Abnormalities 
With 1 exception, the treatment groups were generally similar with regard to the number of subjects who 
had normal hematology or chemistry values at baseline, but who later had values at ECR, EOT, or TOC that 
were below or above normal; there were more subjects in the delafloxacin group who had elevated ALT and 
AST values at EOT and TOC. 
Individual Clinically Significant Abnormalities 
A higher percentage of subjects in the delafloxacin group compared with the moxifloxacin group had a worst 
postbaseline ALT value that was > 2 × ULN (14.5% vs. 10.0%) or > 3 × ULN (5.8% vs. 3.8%), while a 
similar percentage of subjects in both treatment groups had an ALT value > 5 × ULN (1.4% vs. 1.6%). 
Likewise, a higher percentage of subjects in the delafloxacin group had a worst postbaseline AST value that 
was > 2 × ULN (8.2% vs. 5.4%) or > 3 × ULN (3.3% vs. 2.6%), while a similar percentage of subjects in 
both treatment groups had an AST value > 5 × ULN (0.9% vs. 0.5%). 
One subject in the delafloxacin group and no subjects in the moxifloxacin group had a total bilirubin value 
that was > 2 × ULN. Serum creatinine values that were > 2 × ULN or > 3 × ULN were observed in 2 and 1 
subjects, respectively, in the delafloxacin group and 1 subject each in the moxifloxacin group. 
No subject in either treatment group met Hy’s Law criteria (i.e., ALT and / or AST > 3 × ULN, total bilirubin 
> 2 × ULN with alkaline phosphatase < 2 × ULN). 
No subject had an abnormal glucose level (< 2.22 mmol/L).

Vital Signs 
In both treatment groups, there were minimal mean changes from baseline for any vital sign measurement 
(body temperature, diastolic and systolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation). At 
all time points, the mean values for measurements of vital signs were similar between the treatment groups. 
Overall, vital sign measurements improved, as expected. 
Physical Examination Findings 
Findings from the physical examination at Screening and at every postbaseline time point (ECR, EOT, and 
TOC) were similar between the treatment groups. As expected, the respiratory system exhibited the largest 
improvements from Screening (i.e., reduction in abnormal findings). At Screening, in the delafloxacin and 
moxifloxacin groups, 100.0% and 99.8% of subjects had an abnormal finding. The percentage of subjects 
with abnormal respiratory findings decreased at each subsequent time point and was similar between the 
delafloxacin and moxifloxacin groups: ECR, 36.1% and 38.2%; EOT, 17.0% and 17.3%; and TOC, 2.6% and 
4.4%, respectively. 
ElectrocardioGram Results 
One  subject  (0.2%)  in  the  moxifloxacin  group  had  a  TEAE  of  electrocardioGram  QT  prolongation.  This 
subject was 82 years old with a history of asthma, abdominal aortic aneurysm, arterial hypertension, left 
bundle branch block, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. At baseline, the subject’s ECG was assessed 
as abnormal due to a known left bundle branch block, but it was considered not clinically significant. The 
subject developed TEAEs of heart failure (an SAE) on Day 3 and mitral insufficiency due to the left bundle 
branch  block  and  prolonged  QTcF(501  ms)  due  to  heart  failure  on  Day  4.  The  TEAEs  were  considered 
unrelated  to  the  study  drug,  and  no  action  was  taken  with  regard  to  study  treatment  because  of  these 
events. The QT prolongation resolved on Day 10. 
Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic Factors ML-3341-306 
The incidence of TEAEs (total and related to study drug) according to intrinsic ethnic factors (age, sex, race, 
ethnicity, and BMI) and by medical history subgroup is presented in (Table 79). The incidence of related 
TEAEs by subgroup was similar between the treatment groups, with the exception of the National Institutes 
of Health BMI category ≤ 18.4 kg/m2 (underweight), in which 3 of 12 subjects in the delafloxacin group had 
related AEs compared with 0 of 7 subjects in the moxifloxacin group. 
Although there were some numerical differences between the treatment groups in some demographic 
subgroups, these subgroups had a small number of subjects; no major differences were observed in related 
events. Medical history subgroups (History of diabetes, Renal disease, PORT risk class, History of COPD or 
asthma, History of cardiac disease, History of vascular disease, etc.) were compared and no major 
differences were noted (Table 79).

Incidences of TEAEs by subgroup  
Renally impaired patients with mild and moderate renal impairment were included in the Phase III study. 
Patients with severe renal impairment and ESRD patients were not included. However, according to Table 
80, 17 patients with severe renal impairment are reported in the delafloxacin arm and 15 patients in the 
moxifloxacin arm.  
Numerical differences in the incidence of TEAEs are observed. However, these differences appear less 
pronounced when looking at ADRs. The small sample size for some subgroups is acknowledged.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
A total of 22 subjects had treatment withdrawn because of a TEAE: 15 subjects (3.5%) in the delafloxacin 
group and 7 subjects (1.6%) in the moxifloxacin group (Table 81). In the delafloxacin group, 9 subjects 
(2.1%) had treatment withdrawn because of related TEAEs; while in the moxifloxacin group, 4 subjects 
(0.9%) had treatment withdrawn because of related TEAEs. A subject listing of these TEAEs is provided in 
module 2.7.4, Table 2.7.4-13. 
In the delafloxacin group, 15 subjects had single events leading to study drug discontinuation. In 7 subjects, 
the event was an SAE; in 2 of these subjects, the event was fatal (SAEs of pneumonia and myocardial 
infarction). The TEAEs were assessed as moderate in 11 subjects and severe in 4 subjects. In the 9 subjects 
with related TEAEs leading to discontinuation, 6 of the TEAEs were assessed as possibly related; 2, as 
definitely related (TEAEs of hypersensitivity and hepatic enzyme increased); and 1, as probably related. 
In the moxifloxacin group, 6 of 7 subjects had single events leading to study drug discontinuation; 1 subject 
had 2 TEAEs (infusion-site erythema and infusion-site swelling). In 3 subjects, the event was an SAE, and in 
1 of these subjects, the event was fatal (SAE of pulmonary edema). The TEAEs were assessed as mild in 1 
subject, moderate in 5 subjects, and severe in 1 subject. Of the related TEAEs leading to discontinuation, 3 
were assessed as probably related; 1, as possibly related; and 1, as definitely related (pruritic rash).

Adverse Events of Special Interest 
AESIs were chosen based on medical issues of interest for the fluoroquinolone class of antibiotics and taking 
into account the EMA review of serious, disabling and potentially permanent side effects with quinolone and 
fluoroquinolone antibiotics (EMA/175398/2019, November 2018). The 9 selected topics were C. difficile 
diarrhoea, dysglycaemia, hepatic-related events, potential seizures, potential myopathy, potential 
peripheral neuropathy, potential tendon disorder, potential QT prolongation, and potential allergic reaction. 
The search criteria (and Standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Query (SMQ), 
where applicable) used for each medical topic are presented in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). In 
addition, because of recent fluoroquinolone class product labeling updates, a search for events related to 
potential aortic dissection / rupture was included. Finally, reflecting the EMA review, other potential 
neurological and psychiatric AEs were considered. 
A similar percentage of subjects in the delafloxacin (7.9% (34 of 429)) and moxifloxacin groups (7.5% (32 
of 427)) had AESIs (Table 82). Seven subjects in the delafloxacin group and 9 subjects in the moxifloxacin 
group had AESIs that lasted longer than 30 days; all but one of these (acute kidney injury in the moxifloxacin 
group) were hepatic-related events. 
Hepatic-related events: a higher percentage of subjects in the delafloxacin group (5.1%) compared with 
the moxifloxacin group (2.8%) had hepatic-related TEAEs, with transaminases increased reported most 
frequently (3.0% and 1.4%, respectively). Most of these events were considered related to the study drug 
(3.7% in the delafloxacin group and 1.9% in the moxifloxacin group). There were 2 and 1 treatment 
discontinuations, respectively, for delafloxacin and moxifloxacin due to liver enzyme elevations. All the 
hepatic-related TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity in the delafloxacin group; in 1 subject in the 
moxifloxacin group, a TEAE of transaminases increased was considered severe. There were no SAEs due to 
liver abnormalities. Seven subjects in the delafloxacin group and 9 subjects in the moxifloxacin group had 
hepatic-related events that lasted longer than 30 days. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) values > 5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) at any time during the trial were observed 
in a similar percentage of subjects in the delafloxacin (1.4% and 0.9%) and moxifloxacin groups (1.6% and 
0.5%). 
Potential allergic reactions: Eight subjects (1.9%) in the delafloxacin group and 4 subjects (0.9%) 
subjects in the moxifloxacin group had a potential allergic reaction. There were 3 and 2 subjects, 
respectively, in delafloxacin and moxifloxacin treatment groups who discontinued treatment due to potential 
allergic reactions: 1 subject each with allergic dermatitis, urticaria, and hypersensitivity with delafloxacin 
and 1 subject each with allergic dermatitis and rash pruritic on moxifloxacin. All but 1 TEAE were assessed as 
mild or moderate. The severe TEAE was an SAE of hypersensitivity that occurred on Day 2 in a 
delafloxacin-treated subject; treatment with delafloxacin was discontinued. The SAE resolved the same day 
with appropriate treatment. 
C. difficile diarrhoea: Two subjects (0.5%) in the delafloxacin group and 1 subject (0.2%) in the 
moxifloxacin group had a TEAE of C. difficile colitis. One subject in each treatment group discontinued 
treatment because of the AE. Two of the 3 TEAEs were SAEs (one in each treatment group). The SAE in the 
delafloxacin-treated subject was assessed as severe and possibly related to study drug. In 1 subject in each 
treatment group, onset of the TEAE was during treatment with the study drug (Days 3 and 4); in the other 
subject in the delafloxacin group with the severe SAE, onset of the event was on Day 17, after treatment was 
EMA/226278/2021 
Page 129/144 
 
 
 
 
  
 
completed on Day 11 and was considered a success at EOT and TOC (Day 19). In all 3 subjects, the TEAE 
resolved (within 10 to 17 days). 
Dysglycemias: No subject withdrew from the study for dysglycemia-related TEAEs; none of these TEAEs 
was an SAE. 
Hyperglycemia: A lower percentage of subjects in the delafloxacin group had a hyperglycemia-related 
TEAE compared with the moxifloxacin group (0.5% (2 of 429) vs (1.6% (7 of 427)). In the delafloxacin and 
moxifloxacin groups, subjects had the following hyperglycemia-related TEAEs: hyperglycemia (2 (0.5%) and 
6 (1.4%) subjects, respectively) and blood glucose increased (0 and 1 (0.2%), respectively). Seven of 9 
TEAEs were considered unrelated to the study drug by the Investigator. Six of the 9 subjects were reported 
to have diabetes or hyperglycemia at screening, of which 4 were receiving insulin and / or metformin. Four 
of 9 subjects received treatment (either metformin or insulin) for the hyperglycemia. 
Hypoglycemia: No subject in the delafloxacin group and 3 subjects (0.7%) in the moxifloxacin group had a 
TEAE of hypoglycemia. In these moxifloxacin subjects, 1 of the 3 TEAEs was considered mild, and the other 
2 TEAEs were considered moderate. Onsets of the TEAEs were Days 6, 10, and 14; in 2 subjects, the subject 
recovered the same day. Two of the TEAEs were assessed as unrelated, and one was assessed as related to 
the study drug. Two of the 3 subjects were reported to have diabetes or hyperglycemia at screening. 
Potential myopathy: No subjects in the delafloxacin group and 5 subjects (1.2%) in the moxifloxacin group 
had a potential myopathy-related TEAE. These TEAEs were blood creatine phosphokinase increased (2 
(0.5%) subjects) and acute kidney injury, blood creatinine increased, and myalgia (1 (0.2%) subject each). 
None of these events led to treatment discontinuation. No subject had documented myopathy. 
Potential QT prolongation: There were no potential QT-prolongation events with delafloxacin. Two 
subjects (0.5%) in the moxifloxacin group had a TEAE in the SMQ of potential QT prolongation. The TEAEs 
were sudden death and ECG QT prolonged. Sudden death occurred in a subject on Day 20, after the subject 
had completed 9 IV doses of moxifloxacin. The Investigator considered the event unrelated to study drug. 
Cause of death was heart failure. Another subject had a prolonged QT interval corrected with the Fridericia 
formula (QTcF) on Day 4 that was considered mild (QTcF measurements at screening and Day 4 were 345 
and 501 ms, respectively) and unrelated to the study drug. At screening, the subject was noted to have a left 
bundle branch block.  
Potential tendon disorder: No subject in either treatment group experienced a potential tendon disorder 
TEAE. 
Potential phototoxicity: No subject in either treatment group experienced a potential phototoxicity TEAE. 
Potential aortic rupture / dissection: There were no events of aortic rupture / dissection in subjects 
treated with delafloxacin. There was 1 case of sudden death in a moxifloxacin subject, with no further 
information regarding cause of death. 
Potential peripheral neuropathy: No subject in either treatment group experienced a potential peripheral 
neuropathy TEAE.

Potential neurologic and psychiatric AEs 
In addition to the above AESIs predefined in the Statistical Analysis Plan, other potential neurological and 
psychiatric AEs were also considered. Dizziness was reported by 3 patients (0.7%) in the delafloxacin group 
and 2 patients (0.5%) in the moxifloxacin group; in one patient (0.2%) in each group the AE was considered 
to be possibly or probably related to study drug. Somnolence was reported by two patients (0.5%) in the 
delafloxacin group and 1 patient (0.2%) in the moxifloxacin group reported; in one patient (0.2%) in each 
group the AE was considered to be possibly or probably study drug related. Fatigue was reported by 1 
patient (0.2%) in the delafloxacin group, not considered to be drug- related, and by 2 patients (0.5%) in the 
moxifloxacin group, in one of whom (0.2%) it was possibly or probably study drug related. No patient in 
either treatment group discontinued study drug due to dizziness, somnolence or fatigue. 
Few patients in either treatment group reported possible psychiatric adverse events. In the 
delafloxacin-treated group, anxiety and insomnia were each reported in 3 (0.7%) patients, confusional state 
in 2 (0.5%) patients and agitation in 1 (0.2%) patient. In the moxifloxacin-treated group, insomnia was 
reported in 4 (0.9%) patients, and anxiety, confusional state, delirium and sleep disorder each in 1 (0.2%) 
patient. No event in either treatment group was considered to be possibly or probably study drug related, 
and none led to study drug discontinuation. No patient in either group reported depression or problems with 
memory, vision or hearing, or altered taste or smell.

Post marketing experience 
Worldwide Marketing Experience 
Quofenix (delafloxacin) is marketed in the US under the tradename Baxdela. Baxdela® (delafloxacin) 450 
mg Tablets USP, NDA 208610 and Baxdela (delafloxacin) 300 mg Injection USP, NDA 208611 were approved 
in US on 19 June 2017 for the treatment of ABSSSI and on 24 October 2019 for the treatment of CABP. The 
products were launched in US on 29 January 2018. On 11 October 2018, Eurofarma S.A, received 
authorization to market delafloxacin in the following countries: Argentina, under the trade name Delabax on 
11 October 2018, Peru under the trade name Delabaxi on 26 December 2018 (tablets only), and Uruguay 
under the trade name Delabaxi on 27 December 2018 (IV only). The products have not yet been launched in 
Europe at time of the data lock point of this Type II variation, therefore the post-marketing data collected up 
to 30 September 2019 , are the only one referred to above-mentioned countries. 
Patient Exposure From Marketing Experience 
The estimation of cumulative patient exposure from marketing experience was 10,705 patients until data 
lock point of this Type II variation (30 September 2019). Patient exposure was calculated by assuming each 
patient received 11.2 days of therapy, where 1 day of therapy is equivalent to two 350 mg vials or two 450 
mg tablets. Based on the above assumption, a total of 239,752 units (vials or tablets) were dispensed as 
retail prescriptions or sold to non-retail medical facilities since the first launch of delafloxacin in January 
2018, which corresponds to 119,894 days of therapy and an estimated exposure of 10,705 patients. This 
estimate of patient exposure for the cumulative reporting period was based on weekly product distribution 
and dispensing figures and was calculated up to 27 September 2019. 
Safety Data From Post-marketing Experience 
A total of 162 case reports (291 ADR) were reported by spontaneous sources during the post- marketing 
period (up to 30 September 2019). The oral formulation of Baxdela (delafloxacin) was identified as the 
suspect drug in the majority of cases (n= 143 ICSRs). Three cases were specifically reported with the use of 
Baxdela (delafloxacin) injection. Seventy-six cases occurred in adults or elderly and in eighty-five cases the 
age was unknown. One non-serious case of diarrhoea was reported in an 8-year-old female patient 
prescribed oral Baxdela (delafloxacin). No cases of drug exposure during pregnancy or lactation were 
reported. Of the 162 case reports, 18 were serious (27 Serious ADR). No deaths were reported. 
Since the launch of delafloxacin, 6 quarterly Periodic Adverse Event Reports (PADERs) have been submitted 
to the FDA during the postmarketing period (19 June 2017 - 30 September 2019). No safety concern was 
raised for Baxdela following review of the respective aggregate reports. 
Literature 
A literature review of any publication relevant to delafloxacin / meglumine or the fluoroquinolone class from 
June 2018 to 11 January 2019 was conducted in Embase in the context of this application. The search criteria 
included synonym terms for delafloxacin and meglumine, as well as Chemical Abstracts Service numbers 
from the time of Baxdela (delafloxacin) approval (19 June 2017) through 11 January 2019. The literature 
search identified 1199 clinical and nonclinical articles, of which 4 articles identified new safety information for 
ciprofloxacin or meglumine. A further literature search from 01 January 2019 through 27 October 2019 was 
conducted, and no safety issues, not already known with fluoroquinolones, were identified. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The Phase I and Phase IIb studies submitted in support of CAP were not integrated in the summary of clinical 
safety due to differences in study design including posology.  
EMA/226278/2021 
Page 132/144 
 
 
 
 
  
The Phase 1 study (ML-3341-119) showed that delafloxacin was generally well tolerated in healthy adults 
who received 300 mg of delafloxacin intravenously (IV) every 12 hours for a total of 7 doses over 4 days. No 
new safety signals were identified.  
The Phase IIb study (M01-344) employed a different capsule formulation and posology than the currently 
approved formulation and dose in ABSSSI that was also used in the pivotal Phase III study in patients with 
CAP. Although the proportional dose-response relationship of delafloxacin (more ADRs at higher doses) that 
was previously characterised in the ABSSSI MAA appears not to apply entirely in this study, this is not further 
pursued since both the formulation used and the dose employed differed from that in the pivotal Phase III 
study (ML-3341-306) in CAP. As such, the Phase 2b study is considered not relevant to the extension of 
indication proposed in this MAA.  
In the pivotal Phase III study ML-3341-306, the total numbers of subjects who completed the study through 
TOC or prematurely discontinued the study were comparable in the delafloxacin and moxifloxacin treatment 
arms, as such patient exposure appears comparable. 
The most common TEAEs in the delafloxacin group in the Phase III study were diarrhoea (4.7%), 
transaminases increased (3.0%), and headache (1.9%). In most subjects, these events were mild or 
moderate in severity. The most common delafloxacin-related ADRs were diarrhoea (3.7%), and 
transaminases increased (2.6%). Subjects with any severe TEAE accounted for 19 (4.4%) in the delafloxacin 
arm vs. 14 (3.3%) in the moxifloacin arm. Overall, TEAEs and ADRS were numerically higher in the 
delafloxacin arm than in the moxifloxacin arm. Regarding the higher number of related TEAEs in delafloxacin 
group (15.2%) than in moxifloxacin group (12.6%). However, overall numbers are small and do not allow 
identification of a specific pattern. At the Preferred Term (PT) level, some AE splitting is seen among 
reported PT (e.g. “hypertension” and “blood pressure increased”). In the Product Information, preferred PTs 
that were split across different terms describing the same entity/concept have been grouped under one PT 
and frequency categories were changed as a result. This is considered acceptable based on the requirements 
set out in the SmPC guideline EU (rev 2 dated September 2009). In addition, clarification was provided 
regarding the inclusion of ADRs based on singular events. The MAH has provided the details of the AE of 
marrow hyperplasia including the causality assessment. The rationale for causality assessment is based on 
very limited information. Therefore, it is proposed not to include the PT “marrow hyperplasia” in the product 
information of Quofenix at this time 
Delafloxacin had a rate of discontinuations of 3.5% due to TEAEs and 2.1% due to ADRs compared to 
Moxifloxacin with 1.6% due to TEAEs and 0.9% due to ADRs. In the delafloxacin group, more subjects 
discontinued due to an SAE and more had severe TEAEs. Most ADRs leading to study drug discontinuation 
related to delafloxacin were categorised in the “infections and infestations” SOC and likely reflect the 
severity of the condition and disease progression, and can be expected considering the target population. 
Additional TEAEs leading to study drug withdrawal were listed in the “investigations” SOC and were mainly 
related to transaminase elevations, which are common ADRs labelled for delafloxacin already. Similarly, 
TEAEs in the “skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders” SOC include known PTs labelled for delafloxacin and 
related to hypersensitivity reactions (also mapped to AESIs). Narratives for the subjects were provided. The 
primary reasons for withdrawal from study reported for delafloxacin more often included AEs or Death. Most 
TEAEs that led to premature treatment discontinuation were of moderate intensity: 65% (11/17) in the 
delafloxacin arm vs. 50% (4/11) in the moxifloxacin arm. The percentage of severe TEAEs was similar 
between treatment arms (35% vs 38% for delafloxacin and moxifloxacin, resp.). While the fraction of 
moderate TEAEs appears 15% higher in the delafloxacin arm, the subject numbers are overall low and the 
percentages of severe TEAEs leading to premature discontinuation were similar.  
No deaths in study ML-3341-306 were considered related to study drug. Based on the patient narratives 
provided, all patients were characterised as PORT risk class III-V, suffered from co-morbidities and received 
multiple concomitant medications. The conclusion that the reported deaths were not related to study drug 
EMA/226278/2021 
Page 133/144 
 
 
 
 
  
appears plausible. Delafloxacin-related SAEs included C. difficile-colitis and hypersensitivity. In terms of 
SAE, the safety profile of delafloxacin appears overall similar to that of moxifloxacin. Causality assessment 
and additional information on the SAEs agranulocytosis and bursitis was provided. Bursitis is not considered 
related to delafloxacin and close monitoring will be continued for agranulocytosis. 
Considering intrinsic factors, there were some numerical differences between the treatment groups in some 
demographic subgroups. However, these subgroups consisted of small numbers of subjects; no major 
differences were observed in ADRs. Patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment were included 
in the Phase III study. It remains unclear why patients with severe renal impairment were included in the 
study despite this being an exclusion criterion. Patients might have been assessed as moderately renally 
impaired at study entry and progressed after enrolment. The majority of subjects with severe renal 
impairment completed the study: 88.3% (15/17) vs. 93.3% (14/15) in the delafloxacin vs. moxifloxacin 
arm.  Overall numbers of TEAEs from the renal disorder/investigations SOCs were low in these patients and 
3 out of the 4 subjects who did not complete the study did so due to lack of efficacy, not due to safety 
reasons. 
The list of AESIs is considered comprehensive. Not all known (fluoro)quinolone class effects were observed 
with delafloxacin use which is to be expected given that some occur with very rare or unknown frequencies. 
Overall, relatively low numbers of AESIs per SOC were reported. The majority of AESIs in the delafloxacin 
arm was reported for hepatic-related events (delafloxacin arm 5.1% vs moxifloxacin arm 2.8%, mostly due 
to transaminase elevations (3.0% and 1.4%, respectively)) and for potential allergic reactions (8 subjects 
(1.9%) in the delafloxacin arm and 4 subjects (0.9%) in the moxifloxacin group, 1 SAE of hypersensitivity in 
the delafloxacin arm. Based on current labelling information for delafloxacin and moxifloxacin, this is to be 
expected and in line with the known safety profile for both substances.  
Potential myopathy and potential QT prolongation AESIs were more frequently reported in the moxifloxacin 
arm than in the delafloxacin arm. This is in line with a slightly more favourable safety profile of delafloxacin 
in these terms that was already described in the initial ABSSSI MAA.  
Regarding potential neurologic and psychiatric TEAEs, none of which were considered related to study drug 
by the MAH. Anxiety and insomnia can reasonably be expected in the target population and may be 
associated with hospitalization. However, anxiety and insomnia are known ADRs of delafloxacin and included 
in the Product Information already. Moreover, anxiety as well as confusional state and sleep disorders (in 
particular insomnia) are uncommon/common ADRs of other fluroquinolones (e.g. moxifloxacin, 
levofloxacin). Overall, the numbers are relatively low and differences between delafloxacin and moxifloxacin 
appear minor. Since the comparator is a member of the fluoroquinolone class, the conclusion that these PT 
are mainly associated with the patient population and/or hospitalization is difficult to judge and a possible 
class effect cannot be excluded. Therefore, confusional state should be included in the Product Information. 
Close monitoring is recommended for the PTs “sleep disorder”, “agitation” and “delirium” 
Overall numbers of AESIs were similar between delafloxacin and moxifloxacin treated patients and in line 
with known safety profiles of both substances. Updating of section 4.8 to reflect the overall delafloxacin 
safety database (ABSSSI and CAP patients) is endorsed as there appear to be no major differences in TEAEs 
and ADRs in both target populations. For additional changes to the product information, please refer to 
annotated SmPC/PIL.  
Overall, some new delafloxacin ADRs are reported, although most of them occurred in single subjects only. 
No new, major safety signal is identified that would indicate a major difference in overall safety profiles 
between delafloxacin and moxifloxacin though.

2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Taken together, safety data from the subjects in the CAP population (ML-3341-306) and the healthy 
volunteer population (ML-3341-119) support the continued favourable safety profile of delafloxacin. The 
CAP population was older than the ABSSSI population (60 vs. 48 years on average), with associated 
increased comorbidities and severity of illness; thus, the overall AE profile for the CAP population is 
quantitatively different from the ABSSSI population but qualitatively similar. The AE profiles (including 
incidences of AEs, SAEs, discontinuations due to AEs, and AESIs) of delafloxacin and moxifloxacin were 
mostly comparable in each respective CAP and ABSSSI patient population, although some issues remain to 
be clarified. Conclusions are the following: 
• 
Delafloxacin IV / oral treatment was safe and well tolerated at the 300-mg IV and 450-mg oral doses 
in subjects with CAP. 
• 
There is no evidence of any new, major, disabling or potentially significant side effect(s), although 
further information on agranulocytosis and bursitis should be provided before this can be regarded as 
definite. It should be kept in mind that long-lasting, late-onset, or very rare ADRs and those for which no 
frequency can be estimated cannot yet be excluded based on the available safety database.  
• 
There are some quantitative differences in the overall AE profiles of the 2 different indications, 
ABSSSI and CAP (reflected by numerically increased numbers of AEs/ADRs in the CAP population), but no 
new major safety signal.  
• 
• 
New ADRs are added to section 4.8 of the proposed SmPC.  
Compared with the ABSSSI trials, there were more deaths / SAEs in the CAP trial for both 
delafloxacin and comparator. This is expected, given the older population suffering from a more serious 
condition. 
The safety findings in the submitted studies appear to be mostly consistent with the known safety profile of 
delafloxacin, indicating no major safety advantage or disadvantage between delafloxacin and moxifloxacin.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised to amend contact details for the 
representative to mention United Kingdom (Northern Ireland) in line with the current QRD template (10.2) 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
A RUT of the PLs (IV and oral) has been conducted in December 2018 within the first registration procedure 
of Quofenix. The differences between the PLs tested so far and the PL proposed with the present application 
are due only to the addition of the new indication and they are listed below. 
•  Section 1 What Quofenix is and what it is used for: the wording has been amended to include the 
new proposed therapeutic indication. The proposed wording is in line with the one already approved 
for other antibiotic of the same class; 
•  Section 3 How to take Quofenix: the wording has been amended to include the days of treatment for 
the new proposed therapeutic indication; 
•  Section 4 Possible side effects: this section has been updated following the new number of patients 
exposed to delafloxacin, the relevant new side effects arised and their reclassification based on the 
frequencies. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The indication applied for is treatment of CAP in adults when it is considered inappropriate to use other 
antibacterial agents that are commonly recommended for the initial treatment of these infections for IV 
delafloxacin with the option to switch to oral delafloxacin and for sole oral treatment.  
Community-acquired pneumonia is caused most frequently by S. pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae 
and some atypical pathogens such as Legionella pneumophila, but can also involve rarer atypical and Gram 
negative organisms. CAP is classified separately from Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) (developing ≥48 
hours after hospital admission), Ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP) or Health-care associated pneumonia 
(HCAP), which are caused by a different range of pathogens. Management includes systemic antibiotic 
therapy and supportive care.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The most commonly used classes of antibiotics for CAP include beta-lactams, oxazolidinones, glycopeptides, 
macrolides and fluoroquinolones. Delafloxacin does not address an unmet need, but would provide a further 
antibiotic option. 
EMA/226278/2021 
Page 138/144 
 
 
 
 
  
 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical support for this indication mainly include one pivotal Phase 3 study (ML-3341-306).  
Study ML-3341-306 was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, comparator-controlled study to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous to oral delafloxacin in adult subjects with 
community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. 
Eligible patients received either delafloxacin (IV 300 mg a 1-hour IV infusion BID for a minimum of 6 doses, 
with an option to switch to delafloxacin, 450 mg tablet, administered orally BID) or moxifloxacin (IV 400 mg 
as a 1-hour IV infusion every 24 hours for a minimum of 3 active doses, with an option to switch to oral 
moxifloxacin 400 mg administered every 24 hours) for an overall treatment duration of 5 to 10 days. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Pivotal study ML-3341-306 demonstrated high rates of overall clinical response at TOC (the EU primary 
efficacy endpoint) in both treatment arms in both the ModITT population (91.0% delafloxacin, 89.2% 
moxifloxacin) and ModCE-TOC population (94.8% delafloxacin, 93.8% moxifloxacin). The difference 
between treatment arms was 1.1 (95% CI -3.2, 5.5) in the ModITT population and 1.0 (95% CI -2.5, 4.6) in 
the ModCE-TOC population. Given that the lower limit of the 95% CI for the treatment difference between 
arms in the ModITT and ModCE-TOC populations was above the pre-specified margin of -10%, iv/po 
delafloxacin was demonstrated non-inferior to iv/po moxifloxacin. Sensitivity analysis supported results 
from primary analysis. In subgroup analysis no significant differences between treatment groups were 
identified. 
Pivotal study ML-3341-306 investigated IV followed by oral delafloxacin. Regards to sole oral delafloxacin 
treatment it should be considered that in the frame of the initial MAA a BE study was submitted which 
revealed that 300 mg IV delafloxacin and 450 mg oral delafloxacin can be regarded as bioequivalent. 
Therefore, results of pivotal study ML-3341-306 can be extrapolated to sole oral treatment with delafloxacin.  
Overall, pivotal study ML-3341-306 provides robust efficacy results. The aspects of the Points to consider on 
application with one pivotal study (CPMP/EWP/2330/99) are fulfilled. Furthermore, efficacy data are 
supported by PK/PD analysis of pathogens relevant for the indication CAP (S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, H. 
influenzae).  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects  
Concerning pharmacodynamics, uncertainty remains with regard to the primary pharmacology, in particular 
related to delafloxacin susceptibility in surveillance studies for selected pathogens. In context of secondary 
pharmacology, the most important issue is the lack of ELF PK data, which have not been taken into 
consideration for any PK/PD analyses. Neither PK/PD relationships have been investigated for ELF in animal 
models nor was ELF PK considered for PK/PD modelling. Pre-clinical ELF data for delafloxacin are deficient 
and, as the correlation between penetration into human and murine ELF cannot be established, they could 
not be used in PK/PD analyses or PTA analyses and it remains difficult to interpret the adequacy of 
delafloxacin exposure at the effect site. 
In general, it can be concluded that the PTA analyses based on plasma PK/PD targets are adequate. It is 
agreed that PK/PD analyses are robust and support the proposed dosing regimens for CAP caused by S. 
pneumoniae, S. aureus and H. influenzae. In contrast, the proposed dosing regimens are far too low for CAP 
caused by K. pneumoniae or P. aeruginosa. However, the MAH has agreed that a posology or breakpoints for 
these pathogens are no longer being pursued within the current procedure. Given that K. pneumoniae and 
P. aeruginosa are considered less relevant in the indication CAP but are rather more associated with 
EMA/226278/2021 
Page 139/144 
 
 
 
 
  
nosocomial pneumonia (HAP/VAP), no further investigations or analyses regarding these pathogens are 
warranted within this extension of indication variation in CAP.   
Regards to pivotal study ML-3341-306 the other concerns raised during first round were adequately 
addressed.  
Overall, most patients in this application had CAP of relatively mild to moderate severity; 90.7% had 
CURB-65 score of ≤2 and 69.3% were categorised to PORT class III. However, 30.7% of patients had a PORT 
score >III which is in line with the recommendation in the Draft AB GL for studies in CAP initiated by 
intravenous route. Furthermore, about 50% were aged >65 years and 60.3% were overweight; both being 
risk factors for more severe CAP. Taking also into account that only second line indication CAP is applied for, 
patient population studied is regarded as appropriate. Nevertheless, information about the severity of 
disease that was investigated during the pivotal study was added into section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The most common TEAEs in the delafloxacin group in the Phase III study were diarrhoea (4.7%), 
transaminases increased (3.0%), and headache (1.9%). In most subjects, these events were mild or 
moderate in severity. The most common delafloxacin-related ADRs were diarrhoea (3.7%), and 
transaminases increased (2.6%).  
Subjects with any severe TEAE accounted for 19 (4.4%) in the delafloxacin arm vs. 14 (3.3%) in the 
moxifloacin arm. 
Delafloxacin had a rate of discontinuations of 3.5% due to TEAEs and 2.1% due to ADRs compared to 
Moxifloxacin with 1.6% due to TEAEs and 0.9% due to ADRs.  
In the delafloxacin group compared with the moxifloxacin group, the incidence of SAEs (5.4% and 4.7%) 
were similar, and most of these events were considered unrelated to study drug. No deaths were considered 
related to study drug. In the delafloxacin arm, most TEAEs leading to death were singular events, except for 
septic shock (3 deaths) and pneumonia (2 deaths), possibly reflecting the relatively old patient population 
and underlying condition of CAP. These events may reasonably be expected in the disease and target 
population. 
Although low, the incidence of discontinuations, SAEs, and deaths in the CAP population were higher than 
that reported for the ABSSSI population, reflecting the older and sicker CAP population. An examination of 
TEAEs by demographic and medical history subgroups similar to those seen in hospitalized CAP patients 
showed no clinically meaningful differences in the AE profile between delafloxacin and moxifloxacin. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
The 9 selected topics were C. difficile diarrhoea, dysglycemia, hepatic-related events, potential seizures, 
potential myopathy, potential peripheral neuropathy, potential tendon disorder, potential QT prolongation, 
and potential allergic reaction. The incidence of AESIs was similar between the delafloxacin and moxifloxacin 
groups (7.9% and 7.5%). Of the AESIs that lasted longer than 30 days, all but 1 were hepatic-related 
events.  
Regarding potential neurologic and psychiatric TEAEs, none of which were considered related to study drug, 
the MAH has discussed the causality assessment in more detail. In particular since class effects of 
(fluoro)quinolones include psychotic reactions and prolonged, disabling, potentially permanent side effects 
that may include psychiatric effects. While anxiety and insomnia are known ADRs of delafloxacin and labelled 
as such, the ADR confusional state may at least be possibly related to use of delafloxacin as part of a class 
effect. Other TEAEs such as sleep disorder, agitation and delirium are recommended for close monitoring at 
this point. This is also applicable to the TEAE marrow hyperplasia.  
EMA/226278/2021 
Page 140/144 
 
 
 
 
  
There were no cases of laboratory abnormalities meeting the definition of Hy’s law. Laboratory changes with 
delafloxacin were typically unlikely to be related to treatment, were associated with other medical history, 
events, or social circumstances, did not require treatment, and were reversible. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The most common delafloxacin-related ADRs were diarrhoea (3.7%), and transaminases increased (2.6%). 
Subjects with any severe TEAE accounted for 19 (4.4%) in the delafloxacin arm vs. 14 (3.3%) in the 
moxifloacin arm. Most SAEs were considered unrelated to study drug. New ADRs to be labelled for 
delafloxacin include agranulocytosis and confusional state.  
Delafloxacin had a rate of discontinuations of 3.5% due to TEAEs and 2.1% due to ADRs compared to 
Moxifloxacin with 1.6% due to TEAEs and 0.9% due to ADRs. The primary reasons for withdrawal from study 
reported for delafloxacin more often included AEs or Death. However, the patient numbers are limited and 
the percentages of severe TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation are similar between delafloxacin and 
moxifloxacin.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The MAH applied for the extension of indication to include treatment of Community Acquired Pneumonia 
(CAP) in adults when it is considered inappropriate to use other antibacterial agents that are commonly 
recommended for the initial treatment of these infections (second line indication). This is in line with the 
approved indication for moxifloxacin as well as for levofloxacin. For these fluoroquinolones indication CAP 
was limited to second line indication mainly due to safety risks.   
Pivotal study ML-3341-306 demonstrated high rates of overall clinical response at TOC. The difference 
between treatment arms was 1.1 (95% CI -3.2, 5.5) in the ModITT population and 1.0 (95% CI -2.5, 4.6) in 
the ModCE-TOC population. Given that the lower limit of the 95% CI for the treatment difference between 
arms in the ModITT and ModCE-TOC populations was above the pre-specified margin of -10%, delafloxacin 
was demonstrated non-inferior to moxifloxacin. Sensitivity analysis supported results from primary analysis.  
The PK/PD target attainment analyses based on plasma PDTs performed for S. pneumoniae, S. aureus and 
H. influenzae are considered acceptable and provide robust support for the proposed dosing regimens in the 
respective patient populations for the treatment of CAP. However, this conclusion cannot be drawn for K. 
pneumoniae as well as for P. aeruginosa where PTAs above 90 % were achieved for low MIC values only, 
which could not be correlated with MICs observed in surveillance studies. Therefore, concerns were raised 
whether the proposed dosing regimens might be sufficient to cover these two pathogens, although success 
rates at TOC in the pivotal Phase III study were high in patients with CAP caused by K. pneumoniae and P. 
aeruginosa. Notably, the number of patients with these pathogens and MIC at baseline was low. However, 
the MAH has agreed to not pursue a posology or breakpoints for K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa due to 
PK/PD limitations regarding a robust PDI and PTA analyses as well as the limited relevance of these 
pathogens to the indication CAP. 
The limitation remains that no PK/PD target attainment analyses have been performed in ELF. Neither PK/PD 
relationships have been investigated for ELF in animal models nor was ELF PK considered for PK/PD 
modelling. Pre-clinical ELF data for delafloxacin are deficient and, as the correlation between penetration 
into human and murine ELF cannot be established, they could not be used in PK/PD analyses or PTA analyses 
and it remains difficult to interpret the adequacy of delafloxacin exposure at the effect site.  
Regards to safety, data from the subjects in the CAP population (ML-3341-306) and the healthy volunteer 
population (ML-3341-119) support the continued favourable safety profile of delafloxacin. The safety 
findings in the submitted studies are mostly consistent with the known safety profile of delafloxacin, 
indicating no major safety advantage or disadvantage between delafloxacin and moxifloxacin.  
Furthermore, it can be concluded that the MAA meets the prerequisites for one pivotal study application, as 
detailed in EMA Points to consider on application with 1. Meta-analyses; 2. One pivotal study 
(CPMP/EWP/2330/99, 31 May 2001). The pharmacological principle and mechanism of action is established. 
A robust clinical data package has been provided. Data from Study ML-3341-306 can be regarded as valid in 
relation to the indication applied for. According to the EMA Points to consider on application with 1. 
Meta-analyses; 2. One pivotal study (CPMP/EWP/2330/99, 31 May 2001), when the aim is to demonstrate 
non-inferiority, one study is more likely to be accepted if the lower 95% confidence bound is well away from 
the non-inferiority margin. In Study ML-3341-306 the lower bound of 95% confidence interval was -3.2% 
and therefore well away from the non-inferiority margin of -10%. Furthermore, the results of Study 
ML-3341-306 support internal consistency of the data set. In addition, patients in Study ML-3341-306 were 
enrolled across a large number of clinical centres, without dominance of any given centre. 
EMA/226278/2021 
Page 142/144 
 
 
 
 
  
Overall, pivotal study ML-3341-306 provides robust efficacy results and one pivotal study application is 
agreed. Furthermore, efficacy data are supported by PK/PD analysis of pathogens most relevant for CAP (S. 
pneumoniae, S. aureus and H. influenzae). 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Pivotal study ML-3341-306 provides robust efficacy results and one pivotal study application is agreed. 
Furthermore, efficacy data are supported by PK/PD analysis of pathogens most relevant for CAP (S. 
pneumoniae, S. aureus and H. influenzae). 
The B/R balance of delafloxacin for the second line indication CAP (treatment of CAP in adults when it is 
considered inappropriate to use other antibacterial agents that are commonly recommended for the initial 
treatment of these infections) is regarded as positive.

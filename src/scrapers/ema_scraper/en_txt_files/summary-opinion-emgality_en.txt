On 20 September 2018, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Emgality, 
intended for prophylaxis of migraine. The applicant for this medicinal product is Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. 
Emgality will be available as a 120-mg solution for injection. The active substance of Emgality is 
galcanezumab, an analgesic (ATC code: N02CX07) that works by binding to calcitonin gene-related 
peptide (CGRP). 
The benefits with Emgality are its ability to reduce the number of monthly migraine days. The most 
common side effects are pain and reactions at the injection site, vertigo and constipation.  
The full indication is: “Emgality is indicated for the prophylaxis of migraine in adults who have at least 
4 migraine days per month”. It is proposed that Emgality be prescribed by physicians experienced in the 
treatment of migraine. 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and 
made available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been 
granted by the European Commission.

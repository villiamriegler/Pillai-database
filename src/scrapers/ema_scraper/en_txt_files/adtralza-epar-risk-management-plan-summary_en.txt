Summary of risk management plan for Adtralza® (tralokinumab) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Adtralza®. The RMP details important 
risks of Adtralza®, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about Adtralza®’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Adtralza®’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Adtralza® should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Adtralza® should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all of which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Adtralza®’s 
RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Adtralza® is authorised for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adult patients 
who are candidates for systemic therapy (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains tralokinumab 
as the active substance and it is given by subcutaneous injection. 
Further information about the evaluation of Adtralza®’s benefits can be found in Adtralza®’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s 
webpage https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/adtralza. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further characterise the 
risks 
Important risks of Adtralza®, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Adtralza®’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals. 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging. 
•  The authorised pack size – the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly. 
•  The medicine’s legal status – the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or without 
prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and is 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. 
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Adtralza® is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Adtralza® are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of Adtralza®. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has 
not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on 
the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the 
long-term use of the medicine).

Risk minimisation 
measures 
The incidence of conjunctivitis was higher with 
tralokinumab than with placebo in the clinical 
development programme. However, this risk remains to 
be further characterised over longer term and it cannot 
be ruled out that conjunctivitis of longer duration can 
affect the benefit:risk profile, although this is not 
supported by currently available data. Therefore, 
conjunctivitis is considered an important potential risk. 
Patients with AD have an increased risk of ocular 
comorbidities including conjunctivitis compared with 
the general population, and the incidence of ocular 
complications increases with AD severity. Also, a 
medical history of allergic conjunctivitis increases the 
risk of developing conjunctivitis. In the clinical 
development program for tralokinumab more than half 
of the subjects with conjunctivitis AESI in the initial 
treatment period had a past or current history of allergic 
conjunctivitis. 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
Communicate to physicians and patients that 
conjunctivitis is common adverse reaction, and that 
patients treated with tralokinumab who develop 
conjunctivitis that does not resolve following standard 
treatment should undergo ophthalmological 
examination.

Tralokinumab is an immunomodulatory monoclonal 
antibody but is not considered a general 
immunosuppressant. There is a general belief that 
immunomodulatory monoclonal antibodies can 
theoretically contribute to tumour progression over time 
similar to immunosuppressive agents, and malignancy is 
often considered an important potential risk for 
immunomodulatory biologics. 
Based on current non-clinical and clinical data there is 
no evidence of an increased risk of malignancy in 
patients treated with tralokinumab for up to 1 year, but 
since tumours develop over time further long-term data 
is needed. 
Atopic dermatitis could in itself be associated with an 
increased risk of cancer as immune dysregulation is an 
inherent part of the disease. Known risk factors for 
cancer development such as smoking, alcohol, stress, 
and sleep deprivation have also been hypothesised to be 
risk factors for exacerbation of adult AD. Despite these 
hypotheses, there is little empirical evidence of an 
association between AD and most types of cancer. 
Conflicting findings have been reported regarding the 
risk of lymphoma and non-melanoma skin cancer 
(NMSC); a few studies have reported a lack of or a 
negative association between AD and NMSC, whereas 
slightly elevated risks have also been reported for 
NMSC collectively, and specifically for squamous cell 
carcinoma.  
No specific measures are required for patients receiving 
tralokinumab; standard care is adequate.

Risk minimisation 
measures 
Additional 
pharmacovigilance 
activities 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
Communicate to physicians and patients that there is a 
limited amount of data from the use of tralokinumab in 
pregnant women; therefore, as a precautionary measure, 
it is preferable to avoid the use of tralokinumab during 
pregnancy. 
Communicate to physicians and patients that it is 
unknown whether tralokinumab is excreted in human 
milk or absorbed systemically after ingestion, so a 
decision must be made whether to discontinue 
breast-feeding or to discontinue tralokinumab therapy 
taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the 
child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.

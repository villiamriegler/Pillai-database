2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Avatrombopag 40 mg or 60 mg once daily for 5 days is proposed as an alternative treatment option to 
platelet transfusions for patients with thrombocytopenia and CLD scheduled for a procedure to minimise 
bleeding and other safety risks, and to improve clinical management. 
TPO, the principal physiologic regulator of platelet production, is produced constitutively in the liver, 
circulates in the bloodstream, and is delivered to the bone marrow, where it stimulates the early 
development and maturation of multiple haematopoietic lineages and megakaryocytopoiesis; bone 
marrow production of platelets is directly affected by TPO levels. As a result of the damage to the liver in 
patients with CLD, TPO production is reduced, which results in decreased platelet production and 
thrombocytopenia. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
The prevalence of chronic liver condition in Europe, irrespective of cause, is estimated to be 29 million, of 
a total population of some 742 million people. The prevalence of cirrhosis and hepatitis C have been 
estimated to be 0.1 % and from 0.13-3.26%, respectively (Blachier 2013). The estimates correspond to 
14 to 26 new cases cirrhosis per 100,000 inhabitants per year, with large intra-European variations, more 
males than females, and annually some 170.000 deaths in Europe, but a trend towards increase (Blachier 
2013; Akinyemiju 2017).  
Thrombocytopenia is a common complication in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD), with an 
incidence from 64% to 85% of patients with cirrhosis, and often worsens with the progression of liver 
insufficiency (Afdhal 2008; Gingireddy 2014; Micthell 2016). However, a mild to moderate reduction in 
platelet count is not consequently a contributing factor to bleeding in invasive procedures for diagnostic 
or therapeutic procedures. Normally a platelet count is 150 – 400 x 10(9)/L, but only severe 
thrombocytopenia, below 50 x 10(9)/L is considered of clinical relevance in procedures with a bleeding 
risk – that may be biopsies, dental treatment, punctures, catherisations etc. For the individual with severe 
thrombocytopenia the complication of bleeding may be at risk several times a year, because the platelet 
count in most chronic patients worsens during the course, and invasive procedures are performed for 
many purposes.  
The prevalence of severe thrombocytopenia is reported to be 1% of cirrhotic patients, similar in chronic 
hepatitis C, but maybe less common in other causes for CLD (Peck-Radosavljevic 2017: Bashour 2000). 
However, the treatment of hepatitis C has improved, and the platelet counts probably (may) increase due 
to the better viral load control. Given the precautions to calculate, the medical need to support the 
platelet count in a scheduled procedure in cirrhosis affects less than 10.000 persons in Europe. However, 
other causes for CLD as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis are increasingly 
a cause of cirrhosis globally. This burden is expected to increase as epidemics of obesity, diabetes and 
metabolic syndrome continue to grow (Estes 2018). In addition, no data are available as to how many 
invasive procedures, each patient is going through, but since they include dental procedures, punctures 
etc., the annual need for treatment possibly is many times higher than the number of patients with 
platelet counts less than 50 x 10(9)/L. 
The risk of bleeding in procedures varies, like complications in general, with the procedure, if the 
intervention is planned or to be done without a time for preparation, time of day, doctoral skills and 
Assessment report

experience, supportive procedures like imaging, and the status of the patient – like BMI and overall 
comorbidity. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
TPO, the principal physiologic regulator of platelet production, is produced constitutively in the liver, 
circulates in the bloodstream, and is delivered to the bone marrow, where it stimulates the early 
development of multiple haematopoietic lineages and megakaryocytopoiesis. Bone marrow production of 
platelets is directly affected by TPO levels. Liver disease, including hepatitis C and cirrhosis, may lead to 
reduced TPO production and consequently result in decreased platelet production. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation and diagnosis  
Thrombocytopenia presents a significant challenge in the clinical management of patients with CLD, since 
they require multiple invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures over the course of their disease, 
routinely 1 to 3 invasive procedures annually, each of which carries a risk of bleeding. These include 
clinically necessary liver biopsies, thoracenteses, endoscopies/colonoscopies/bronchoscopies with and 
without biopsies, chemoablation and radiofrequency ablation, intrahepatic shunt placement, vascular 
catheterizations, and even dental procedures. There are no approved pharmaceutical options to treat 
thrombocytopenia in patients with CLD undergoing procedures, and if not effectively treated, 
thrombocytopenia can lead to serious uncontrolled bleeding, resulting in prolonged hospitalizations and 
other post-procedure complications. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Transfusion with thrombocytes isolated from blood from healthy donors, and routinely packed in platelet 
concentrates from 4-6 donors to increase the thrombocyte count in the blood product, is the most 
effective, standard substitution to optimize the thrombocyte count before a scheduled procedure in a 
patient with severe thrombocytopenia (Hayashi 2014; Kaufman 2015). The transfusion with platelets has 
an immediate effect, but may be accompanied by HLA-allo immunisation and reactions, blood-product 
born infection and an effect lasting 24-48 hours (at most) to maintain a platelet count above 50 x 10(9)/L, 
considered safe for most procedures. Alternative handling in development is pharmaceutical strategies 
(Maan 2015) or ex vivo derived artificial platelet structures (Hickman 2018). 
Lusutrombopag, a TPO-receptor agonists, was recently authorised in Europe for the use in patients with 
thrombocytopenia. 
About the product 
Avatrombopag is a small molecule TPO-receptor agonist, which after oral administration in tablets with a 
meal once daily, for five days only, causes an increase in the number of platelets in the blood. 
Avatrombopag 40 mg (in patients with platelet count ≥40 and < 50 x 10(9)/L) or 60 mg (in patients with 
a platelet count <40 x 10(9)/L) is proposed for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with 
chronic liver disease with a planned procedure. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
“Treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic liver disease who are scheduled to undergo 
a procedure.” 
The following indication was agreed by CHMP: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/322871/2019 
Page 11/123 
 
 
 
“Treatment of severe thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic liver disease who are scheduled to 
undergo an invasive procedure.” 
The recommended daily dose of avatrombopag is based on the patient’s platelet count (table below). 
Dosing should begin 10 to 13 days prior to the planned procedure. The patient should undergo their 
procedure 5 to 8 days after the last dose of avatrombopag.

1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone, dimethyl sulfoxide and N-methylpyrrolidone, slightly soluble in 
methanol and ethanol (dehydrated) and practically insoluble in water, acetonitrile, acetone, ethyl acetate, 
hexane, and tert-butylmethyl ether  
The active substance has a non - chiral molecular structure.  
Polymorphism has been observed for the active substance. Three anhydrous crystal forms (Form-A, 
Form-B, and Form-C) of avatrombopag maleate have been identified.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is synthesized in 5 main steps encompassing eight chemical transformations plus 
salt formation using commercially available well defined starting materials with acceptable specifications.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. Critical process parameters (CPPs) in the 
synthesis, identified by risk assessment, chemical knowledge and experimentation are provided. As each 
step contains critical process parameters, all five manufacturing steps are designated as critical steps. 
The control of critical steps in the manufacture of avatrombopag maleate is achieved by controlling all 
CPPs with in each proven acceptable range (PAR).The specifications and control methods for intermediate 
products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. Data of 
the mutagenic impurity assessment including Ames testing and in-silico predictions has been provided. 
The identified mutagenic impurities are sufficiently controlled at the intermediate steps with adequate 
limits. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the clinical 
development program. During development, the process has been optimized to achieve the commercial 
manufacturing process without changing the synthetic route. During manufacturing process development 
PARs were established for all process parameters which were considered important for consistent 
manufacturing of avatrombopag maleate.  Additionally, quality attributes (QAs) were used to designate 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/322871/2019 
Page 13/123 
 
 
 
 
material attributes and (potential) critical quality attributes that were evaluated by risk.  Each attribute 
was assessed against the unit process(es) that may influence it, using the Failure Mode and Effect 
Analysis (FMEA) tool.  This output was then used to confirm the PARs for the Critical Process Parameters 
(CPPs) of the manufacturing process. Only parameters assessed as a medium or a high risk (e.g. CPP or 
potential CPP) in the FMEA risk assessment were further evaluated, as this output indicated a potential 
risk to the control of quality. No further studies were conducted for those parameters deemed non-critical 
or low risk.    
For those parameters assessed as a CPP, a Design of Experiments (DoE) approach or traditional 
range-finding univariate analysis was employed, depending on the variable.  DoE was used for 
multivariate analysis, e.g., where multiple variables could affect the outcome for the unit operation (i.e., 
reactions, isolation, etc.).  A traditional range finding approach (univariate analysis) was performed for 
parameters such as solvent volumes, where only a single variable was involved in the outcome for that 
unit operation, (i.e., impurity purging during crystallization and isolation) as determined during the risk 
assessment and development history.  PARs were set for all process parameters which were considered as 
important for the stable manufacturing. 
PARs are considered to have been adequately justified, providing confidence of comprehensive 
knowledge of synthesis. Target setting/normal operating range has been added. Confirmation has been 
given that as design space has not been claimed, PARs will only be deliberately changed one at a time. 
Two types of container closure systems are applied for avatrombopag maleate; one is a polyethylene bag 
that is made of a mixture of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) 
film as a primary container and triple laminated aluminum pouch as a secondary container. Another is a 
polyethylene bag which is made of LDPE film as a primary container and quadruple laminated aluminum 
pouch as a secondary container. Both packaging comply with the EC directives 2002/72/EC and EC 
10/2011 as amended.  
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for description (appearance), identification (IR, XRPD), 
water content (KF), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), maleic acid content (HPLC), residue on 
ignition (Ph. Eur.), particle size (light diffraction), residual solvents (GC), and microbial limits (Ph. Eur). 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for identification, assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data of 17 commercial and pilot scale batches of the active substance are provided. The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturers 
stored LDPE-LLDPE bag placed in triple laminated aluminum bag for up to 48 months under long term 
conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
Additionally, bridging stability studies (BSS) were conducted for the material change of polyethylene bag 
as alternative primary container LDPE bag placed in quadruple laminated aluminium bag for up to 12 
Assessment report

Page 14/123 
 
 
 
months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions 
(40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
The following parameters were tested: description (appearance), identification, water content, related 
substances and assay. 
No trends were observed for any batches and there were no significant changes under long term and 
accelerate stability conditions in the stability and bridging stability studies. 
Stress testing in solid/aqueous solution states is also conducted. Stress testing in solid state has been 
conducted to investigate the intrinsic stability of avatrombopag maleate, heat (50°C), or humidity 
(25°C/75%) in solid state. From the results, avatrombopag maleate was found to be stable under heat 
and humidity conditions. Stress testing in solution state has been investigated to establish the 
degradation pathways of avatrombopag maleate. In this study, avatrombopag maleate was subjected to 
acid (2% trifluoroacetic acid) and base (0.1 mol/L sodium hydroxide) stress conditions so as to induce 
degradation. Three major degradation products were identified by HPLC analysis and the degradation 
pathways are established 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on 1 batch. Slight degradation was 
observed during light exposure. Therefore, avatrombopag maleate needs to be protected from light.  
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 48 months stored in the 
commercial packaging configurations to protect from light in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is round, yellow, biconvex, immediate release film-coated tablets debossed with 
“AVA” on one side and “20” on the other. 
The finished product pharmaceutical development and control strategy are considered traditional. 
However, principles of QbD as described in ICH Q8 through Q11 such as definition of a quality target 
product profile (QTPP) associated finished product critical quality attributes (CQAs) as well as formulation 
and process risk assessments have been utilised in formulation and process development to develop the 
control strategy.  A design space has not been claimed by the applicant. The parameters within a unit 
operation (mixing, granulation, tableting, etc.) were evaluated using a risk-based approach to establish 
the PARs. The PAR ranges will only be changed deliberately one at a time. 
The aim of the product development was to develop a tablet at an appropriate dose and of an appropriate 
size with acceptable palatability. 
Avatrombopag maleate is practically insoluble in water in the pH range of 1 to 9. The effect of the active 
substance particle size on the dissolution profile of finished product was investigated using laboratory 
scale batches. Based on the results, it was concluded that when the particle size of the active substance 
is controlled by the specification of the active substance, there was no significant variation in dissolution 
of the finished product. As mentioned, three different anhydrous crystal forms (Form-A, Form-B, and 
Form-C) of avatrombopag maleate have been identified. The current manufacturing process and controls 
consistently provides the desired polymorphic form. Control strategies during the manufacturing process 
and storage are employed to ensure no solid state transformation of avatrombopag maleate in the 
finished product. Firstly, the water content of the finished product during the manufacturing process is 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/322871/2019 
Page 15/123 
 
 
 
 
controlled (storage condition of intermediate, in-process control at bulk packaging process and 
environment control in primary packaging process). Secondly, a moisture proof packaging configuration 
(Alu/Alu blisters) was selected as the primary packaging. No solid state transformation of avatrombopag 
maleate was detected in finished product during both finished product manufacturing and storage. 
The compatibility of the active substance with excipients was assessed focusing on the stability in the 
formulation design of the finished product.  No active substance degradation was observed in mixtures 
with any excipients, except opadry yellow. Because of limited contact of active substance with opadry 
yellow as a coating, degradation of active substance in the tablet formulation was not expected. This was 
confirmed by stability studies. The excipients were selected to enable optimum dissolution of the finished 
product. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. 
Eur. standards except the opadry yellow which complies with in-house specifications. There are no novel 
excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the 
SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
Three  different  oral  formulations  were  used  in  clinical  studies.  A  powder  for  oral  suspension  (PFS) 
formulation and two film-coated tablet formulations. The initial Phase 1 clinical studies were supplied with 
the PFS formulation. Subsequent Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies were supplied with avatrombopag 
film  coated  tablets  (Formulation  A).  Formulation  A  had  poor  flowability  and  it  induced  low  content 
uniformity. Therefore, it was evaluated as a low scalability product. Subsequently, film coated tablets 
(Formulation  B)  were  developed.  Formulation  B  was  chosen  for  marketing.  Three  third  generation 
prototype  formulations  (Formulation  C)  of  the  finished  product  (cyclodextrin  oral  solution,  oral 
suspension,  and  lipid-based  powder  for  oral  suspension)  were  tested  in  an  effort  to  improve  the 
bioavailability and reduce the variability in pharmacokinetics (PK). A study was conducted to evaluate 
characteristics  of  Formulation  C  relative  to  Formulation  B.  However,  none  of  these  formulations  were 
pursued for further development based on the overall PK profiles and manufacturing challenges. 
Bioequivalence studies were performed showing bioequivalence between the clinical formulation and the 
proposed commercial formulation 
The USP<711> paddle method was selected as the dissolution method. The discriminatory power of the 
selected method  was demonstrated with regard to particle size of the active substance.  
An initial risk assessment for the manufacturing process at commercial scale was performed so as to 
identify process parameters that were likely to affect the Quality Attributes (QAs) and Critical Quality 
Attributes (CQAs). Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA), as exemplified in the ICH Guideline Q9 
“Quality Risk Management,” was employed. The initial risk assessment was performed based on the 
understanding obtained at pilot scale and prior knowledge during the development of the finished 
product. To identify the CQAs, classification of QAs/CQA was conducted based on the effect on safety or 
efficacy, and the Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP). QAs which were classified as ‘Extreme’ were 
re-designated as CQAs as it was deemed that there could be considerable effect on safety or efficacy. QAs 
which were deemed to have (a) an indirect effect or no effect on safety or efficacy were classified as ‘low’, 
(b) slight effect were designated as ‘middle’ and (c) potential effect on safety and/or efficacy were 
classified as ‘high’. However, no risk parameter was considered as high. Nine risk parameters were 
categorized as potentially middle risk. For the potentially middle risk parameters, the effect of these 
parameters on QAs/CQA and the acceptable range for the parameters were evaluated. For the potentially 
low risk parameters, evaluations were also conducted to confirm the suitability of the operating conditions 
adopted. Based on the results of the initial risk assessment by FMEA, each process parameter was 
thoroughly investigated. Process parameters potentially having a critical effect on QAs/CQA were further 
evaluated in the process development studies. Based on the results of the studies, the risk level for each 
process parameter affecting QAs/CQA was mitigated by establishing appropriately fixed PARs, and 
optimized operating conditions at the commercial production scale. Based on the results obtained from 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/322871/2019 
Page 16/123 
 
 
 
manufacturing process and formulation development studies, the risks for the commercial production 
process were reassessed and revised. The risk levels of all process parameters originally identified by 
FMEA were mitigated to ”low”. Therefore, it was concluded that a robust manufacturing processes has 
been established for the finished product. A design space has not been claimed by the applicant, and the 
parameters within a unit operation (mixing, granulation, tableting, etc.) were evaluated using a 
risk-based approach to establish the PARs. The PAR ranges will only be changed deliberately one at a 
time. 
The  finished  product  is  packaged  in  polyamide  and  polyvinyl  chloride  laminated  aluminium  film  with 
push-through aluminium and polyethylene terephthalate foil blisters. Specifications for the forming film 
and  the  lidding  foil  have  been  presented,  which  include  identification  testing  and  dimensions. 
Confirmations  have  been  given  that  the  packaging  materials  in  immediate  contact  with  the  finished 
product conform to relevant Ph. Eur. chapters and/or comply with EU quality requirements for materials 
to come into contact with food. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability 
data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of ten main steps: mixing 1, milling, mixing 2, granulation, sizing, 
lubrication, tableting, coating, bulk packaging, and blister packaging. The process is considered to be a 
standard manufacturing process. 
Control of critical manufacturing steps is achieved through established operating parameters critical to 
the finished product (mixing 1, milling, mixing 2, granulation, sizing, lubrication, tableting and coating) 
meeting its final product specifications. The respective parameter settings and proven acceptance ranges 
(PARs) were selected based upon the results of studies. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing 
process. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
description (visual), identification (UV/Vis, HPLC or HPLC-PDA), assay (HPLC), related substances 
(HPLC), dissolution (Ph. Eur.) uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.) and microbial limits (Ph. Eur.) 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and 
impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 15 commercial and pilot batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of finished product stored for up to 48 months under long 
term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH)

according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are representative to 
those proposed for marketing as the active substance used is manufactured in a different site than the 
one proposed for marketing and were packed in a similar primary packaging proposed for marketing. The 
difference is that the lidding foil of the product monitored in the registration stability study does not have 
the outer layer of PET as the proposed for marketing. 
Samples were tested for description, related substances, assay, dissolution, loss on drying, and microbial 
limits. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating.  
Under long-term and accelerated conditions no significant changes have been observed. 
However, as the product batches subjected to stability testing at long-term and accelerated conditions, 
have been obtained using active substance manufactured at a site different from that proposed and  the 
container closure system for these batches does not correspond to that proposed for marketing, the CHMP 
recommends to conduct accelerated stability testing on the first three commercial batches of each 
packaging configuration (10 and 15 tablet count) in the final commercial packaging, including the 
polyamide and polyvinyl chloride laminated aluminium film with push-through aluminium and 
polyethylene terephthalate foil blisters. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. Generally, there were no changes compared to the dark control, only 
there was an increase in loss on drying which is not unexpected since the photostability study is 
conducted on an open Petri dish. These results support the conclusion that protection from light is not 
required during manufacturing, distribution, or long term storage. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 48 months without special storage conditions 
as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those 
used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of 
ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of 
Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substance and finished product 
and their manufacturing process. However, no design spaces were claimed for the manufacturing process 
of the active substance, nor for the finished product. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there was a one minor unresolved quality issues having no impact on the 
Benefit/Risk ratio of the product.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented 
to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
- To conduct accelerated stability testing on the first three commercial batches of each packaging 
configuration (10 and 15 tablet count) in the final commercial packaging, including the polyamide and 
polyvinyl chloride laminated aluminium film with push-through aluminium and polyethylene terephthalate 
foil blisters. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Avatrombopag is an orally active, small molecule thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist that stimulates 
proliferation and differentiation of megakaryocytes from bone marrow progenitor cells resulting in 
increased production of platelets. Avatrombopag does not compete with TPO for binding to the TPO 
receptor and has an additive effect with TPO on platelet production. 
Avatrombopag does not stimulate platelet production in mice, rats, monkeys, or dogs because of the 
unique TPO receptor specificity. Therefore, data from these animal studies do not fully model potential 
adverse effects related to platelet count increases due to avatrombopag in humans. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
IN VITRO 
Avatrombopag and rhTPO both increased the proliferation of Ba/F3-human c-Mpl cells in a 
concentration-dependent manner. The EC50 values (mean ±SEM, n=5) were 3.3±0.2 nmol/L for 
avatrombopag and 0.065±0.005 nmol/L for rhTPO, a 50-fold difference. Maximum proliferative activity of 
avatrombopag was similar to that of rhTPO. Avatrombopag and rhTPO did not stimulate the proliferation 
of parental Ba/F3 cells lacking c-Mpl, whereas recombinant rmIL-3 did. The results indicate that 
avatrombopag acts on human c-Mpl to stimulate cell proliferation. 
Avatrombopag promoted the differentiation of human CB CD34+ cells to human megakaryocytes in a 
concentration-dependent manner. EC50 values (mean ±SEM, n=5) for promotion of differentiation were 
25.0±7.8 nmol/L for avatrombopag and 0.122±0.014 nmol/L for rhTPO, a 200-fold difference. The 
maximum activity of avatrombopag was similar to that of rhTPO. Human megakaryocyte colonies 
generated with avatrombopag and rhTPO had similar morphologic features. These results show that 
avatrombopag promotes the differentiation of human hematopoietic progenitor cells into megakaryocytes 
to a level that is consistent with the activity of rhTPO. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/322871/2019 
Page 19/123 
 
 
 
Avatrombopag did not affect the differentiation of human hematopoietic progenitor cells even at a 
concentration of 3 μmol/L, which is approximately a100-fold higher concentration than the EC50 value of 
avatrombopag for human megakaryocyte colony formation. 
Both avatrombopag and rhTPO promoted differentiation of human PB CD34+ cells into CD41+CD45+ 
cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Ploidy distribution was analyzed at concentrations of 3 
µmol/L avatrombopag and 3 nmol/L rhTPO. In the ploidy analysis, cells expressing CD41 and with positive 
propidium iodide staining were regarded as megakaryocytes, since erythrocytes and platelets do not have 
DNA. Following surface marker staining, DNA analysis was performed after staining with propidium iodide. 
No significant difference at each ploidy level was found in cells incubated with avatrombopag or rhTPO. 
Avatrombopag or rhTPO alone increased the number of megakaryocytes in a concentration-dependent 
manner, and the maximum activity of avatrombopag was similar to that of rhTPO. In addition, 
avatrombopag was shown to increase the number of megakaryocytes further even in the presence of 
3 nmol/L rhTPO; a combination of 3 μmol/L avatrombopag and 3 nmol/L rhTPO increased 
megakaryocytes approximately 2-fold more than 3 nmol/L rhTPO alone (P<0.001). The numbers of 
hematopoietic progenitor cells (Figure 2.1.2), and megakaryocytic progenitor cells were also increased to 
a greater degree by the combination of avatrombopag and rhTPO compared with avatrombopag or rhTPO 
alone. 
Avatrombopag induced phosphorylation of STAT3, STAT5, or ERK proteins in human blood platelets and 
Ba/F3-human c-Mpl cells, similar to rhTPO, demonstrating the ability of avatrombopag to activate both 
the JAK-STAT and SHC-Ras-Raf-ERK signaling pathways via human c-Mpl. 
The species specificity of avatrombopag was evaluated by its ability to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of 
STAT5 in blood platelets prepared from human, rat, guinea pig, rabbit, and beagle dog, common 
marmoset and squirrel, rhesus and cynomolgus monkey, hamster and pig, olive baboon, and 
chimpanzee. Similar to rhTPO, avatrombopag was shown to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 in 
human and chimpanzee blood platelets. Avatrombopag, however, did not induce tyrosine 
phosphorylation of STAT5 in platelets of any other species tested: rat, hamster, guinea pig, rabbit, beagle 
dog, common marmoset, squirrel monkey, rhesus monkey, cynomolgus monkey, olive baboon, and pig. 
In contrast, rhTPO induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 in platelets of all tested species. 
TM41 (inhibitor of TPO binding to human c-Mpl) inhibited 125I-rhTPO binding to human platelets in a 
concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 515±32 μmol/L.  In contrast, avatrombopag did 
not inhibit the binding of 125I-rhTPO up to 100 μmol/L. Therefore, at a concentration 30,000-fold greater 
than the EC50 value for proliferative activity of Ba/F3-human c-Mpl cells, avatrombopag had no effect on 
125I-rhTPO binding. 
The extracellular domain (ECD) of human c-Mpl consists of 2 duplicate CRH domains referred to as CRH1 
and CRH2.  TPO binds the CRH1 domain of c-Mpl (Sabath, et al., 1999).  Avatrombopag was 
demonstrated to have no effect in cynomolgus monkeys.  In order to determine whether the activity of 
avatrombopag was dependent on the CRH1 of human c-Mpl, a cynomolgus monkey CRH1/human 
CRH2-ICD chimeric c-Mpl and a human CRH1/cynomolgus monkey CRH2-ICD chimeric c-Mpl construct 
were prepared and transfected into Ba/F3 cells. rhTPO was shown to support the proliferation of all cells 
used in a concentration-dependent manner.  In contrast, avatrombopag stimulated the proliferation of 
Ba/F3-human c-Mpl cells and Ba/F3-chimeric c-Mpl (cynomolgus monkey CRH1/human CRH2-ICD) cells, 
but not the growth of Ba/F3-cynomolgus monkey c-Mpl cells or Ba/F3-chimeric c-Mpl (human 
CRH1/cynomolgus monkey CRH2-ICD) cells.  These results showed that a region of the human c-Mpl 
including the CRH2 transmembrane domain and the ICD, was important for avatrombopag activity, and 
that the site of action of avatrombopag on human c-Mpl differs from that of rhTPO. Avatrombopag was 
shown to be specific for human c-Mpl and did not affect Ba/F3-murine c-Mpl cells.  To determine if 
avatrombopag acted through an ECD, ICD, or transmembrane domain, this species specificity was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/322871/2019 
Page 20/123 
 
 
 
exploited by preparing c-Mpl receptors having various combinations of ECD, ICD, and transmembrane 
domains of either human or murine origin.  Specifically, human Met1-Trp491/murine Ile483-Pro625 chimeric 
c-Mpl and murine Met1-Ser496/human Ala506-Pro635 chimeric c-Mpl were constructed and these constructs 
were transfected into Ba/F3 cells.  The effect of avatrombopag on the proliferation of Ba/F3 cells 
transfected with these different constructs was then determined. rhTPO was shown to stimulate the 
proliferation of all cells used in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, avatrombopag and 
eltrombopag only stimulated the proliferation of Ba/F3-human c-Mpl cells but not the proliferation of 
Ba/F3-murine c-Mpl or Ba/F3-chimeric c-Mpl (murine Met1-Ser496/human Ala506-Pro635) cells, suggesting 
that avatrombopag does not act on the ECD or ICD of human c-Mpl.  These results suggest that 
avatrombopag requires the transmembrane domain of human c-Mpl for proliferative activity. 
IN VIVO 
The effects of avatrombopag on platelet production were investigated in NOD/SCID mice transplanted 
with human fetal liver CD34+ cells.  Xenogeneic transplantation of human CD34+ PB stem cells into 
NOD/SCID mice provides an in vivo model to study human megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet production 
(Perez, et al. 2001). 
Avatrombopag was administered orally at doses of 0, 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg/day for 14 days to NOD/SCID 
mice engrafted with human fetal liver CD34+ cells, previously shown to produce greater than 0.09% of 
hCD41+ platelets from 17 or 18 weeks post-transplant.  PB was collected before dosing and on Days 7, 14, 
21, and 28 after the start of avatrombopag administration, and blood cell counts and hCD41+ platelets 
were measured. 
Oral administration of avatrombopag increased the number of human platelets in a dose-dependent 
manner, resulting in approximately a 2.7-fold increase at 1 mg/kg/day and a 3.0-fold increase at 
3 mg/kg/day at 14 days after the start of administration. The minimum effective dose was 1 mg/kg/day.  
The unbound concentration of avatrombopag in plasma after a 14-day repeated administration of 
1 mg/kg avatrombopag was estimated to be around 5 nmol/L (Cmax: 29.5 ng/mL; plasma protein binding: 
89.0% to 89.7%).  Cessation of avatrombopag administration caused the human platelet count to return 
to nearly pretreatment levels.  In contrast, the murine platelet count did not change after oral 
administration of avatrombopag at any dose. 
The effect of avatrombopag on platelet production was examined in cynomolgus monkeys. Six male 
cynomolgus monkeys were randomized to receive orally either 30 mg/kg/day of avatrombopag or vehicle 
for 14 days.  Blood samples were drawn before dosing and on Days 7, 14, and 21 after the start of drug 
administration and hematologic parameters were measured using an automatic blood cell counter.  
Oral administration of avatrombopag at 30 mg/kg/day for 14 days did not increase platelet count in the 
PB of cynomolgus monkeys compared to the vehicle group. The plasma concentration of avatrombopag 
on Day 14 after the start of drug administration was over 6 μg/mL (about 10 μmol/L).  EC50 values 
previously reported for the proliferative effect of avatrombopag on Ba/F3-human c-Mpl cells and its effect 
on differentiation of human hematopoietic progenitor cells to megakaryocytes were 3.3 nmol/L and 
25.0 nmol/L, respectively.  Therefore, the plasma concentrations of avatrombopag on Day 14 in these 
monkeys greatly exceeded the reported human EC50 values.  Avatrombopag had no effect in cynomolgus 
monkeys in vivo and this result is consistent with the in vitro finding that avatrombopag did not induce 
tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 in cynomolgus monkey platelets.

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Binding Panel Assay 
Avatrombopag was investigated for its binding at 1 and 10 μmol/L in duplicate to a panel of 86 receptors, 
transporters, and ion channels.  Functional assays were also conducted for a secretin agonistic effect at 1 
and 10 μmol/L, cholecystokinin 2 (CCK2) agonistic/antagonistic effects at 5 concentrations up to 10 
μmol/L.  Enzyme assays were conducted for Na+/K+-ATPase at 1 and 10 μmol/L and for H+/K+-ATPase at 
8 concentrations up to 100 μmol/L.   
No significant effects (>50% inhibition or activation) were observed with avatrombopag treatment at 1 
μmol/L.  Significant avatrombopag binding (≥50% inhibition) was observed at high concentration of 
10 μmol/L to the adenosine A3 (A3), angiotensin II type 1 (AT1), CCK2, muscarinic 4 (M4), neurokinin 2 
(NK2), neurokinin 3 (NK3), 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) 5A (5-HT5a) receptors, and the N-type Ca2+ 
channel.  Avatrombopag was shown to have an antagonistic effect for the CCK2 receptor with an IC50 
value of 7.0 μmol/L.  Avatrombopag had no effects on Na+/K+-ATPase or secretin agonistic activities at 
concentrations up to 10 μmol/L, or on H+/K+-ATPase at concentrations up to 100 μmol/L. 
Platelet Aggregation 
Human PRP was prepared from healthy volunteers.  To examine the enhancing effect on platelet 
aggregation of avatrombopag and rhTPO, either avatrombopag (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 μmol/L), rhTPO (0.05, 
0.5, 5, 50 nmol/L) or vehicle (PBS containing 0.35% bovine serum albumin) was added to PRP 5 minutes 
prior to the addition of ADP, and incubated at room temperature.  ADP is a known inducer of platelet 
aggregation.  To determine the platelet aggregation-inducing effect of avatrombopag and rhTPO alone, 
avatrombopag, rhTPO, or vehicle was added to the incubation mixture instead of ADP.   
Avatrombopag did not induce or enhance platelet aggregation regardless of the absence or presence of 
ADP.  In contrast, rhTPO (50 nmol/L) induced significant platelet aggregation in the absence of ADP, and 
rhTPO (5 and 50 nmol/L) enhanced ADP-induced platelet aggregation.  Taken together, avatrombopag 
did not enhance or induce platelet aggregation even at 10 µmol/L, a concentration that is 2000-fold 
higher than the minimum effective concentration of rhTPO (5 nmol/L) on platelet aggregation. 
Platelet Activation 
The effects of avatrombopag on human platelet activation were investigated by assessing the ability of 
avatrombopag to affect the expression of the platelet activation marker CD62P on human platelets in vitro 
and in vivo.  CD62P is rapidly translocated to the plasma membrane upon platelet activation, and used as 
a marker of platelet activation. 
In vivo, PRP was mixed with either avatrombopag (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 μmol/L), rhTPO (0.05, 0.5, 5, 
50 nmol/L) or vehicle (PBS containing 0.35% bovine serum albumin).  After 10 minutes, either ADP or 
saline was added and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature.  Platelet activation was measured 
using flow cytometry as the CD62P expression on platelets stimulated with ADP.  Platelets were identified 
as the fractions stained by fluorescein (FITC)-conjugated anti-CD42a antibody, and the median 
fluorescence intensities of R-phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-human CD62P on CD42a fractions were 
analyzed.  The CD62P expression of each sample was calculated by taking the difference between the 
median fluorescence intensity of CD62P on platelets stimulated with 200 μmol/L ADP and that on 
unstimulated platelets stained by isotype-matched antibody (PE-conjugated mouse IgG1, κ) as 100%. 
Avatrombopag did not significantly enhance the expression of CD62P on human platelets regardless of 
the absence or presence of ADP, supporting its lack of affect on platelet activation. On the other hand, 
rhTPO significantly induced the CD62P expression on human platelets both in the absence and presence 
of ADP.  The enhancing effect of rhTPO is significant (P<0.001) at an equal or greater concentration than 
Assessment report

5 nmol/L in the presence of ADP, and significant (P<0.01) at 0.5 nmol/L in the high-level ADP stimulation.  
In the absence of ADP, 50 nmol/L of rhTPO significantly (P<0.01) induced CD62P expression.  Collectively, 
no significant effects were observed at avatrombopag concentrations up to 10 µmol/L, which is 
20,000-fold higher than the minimum effective concentration (0.5 nmol/L) of rhTPO. 
The in vivo effects of avatrombopag on platelet activation were subsequently investigated in NOD/SCID 
mice transplanted with human fetal liver CD34+ cells.  Avatrombopag (0 or 3 mg/kg/day) was 
administered orally for 14 days to NOD/SCID mice transplanted with human fetal liver CD34+ cells.  PB 
was collected on Day 15 after the start of avatrombopag administration and platelets were activated by 
the addition of thrombin receptor agonist peptide (TRAP).  Following platelet activation, blood cell counts, 
human platelets, and the expression of CD62P were determined.  The time course of changes in human 
platelet number and the expression of CD62P were measured and expressed in terms of the rate of 
increase after drug administration relative to the value at predosing. 
TRAP-induced CD62P expression was observed on human platelets produced by NOD/SCID mice 
transplanted with human fetal liver CD34+ cells.  The maximum response of CD62P expression on human 
platelets induced by 167 μmol/L TRAP, an amount of TRAP in excess of that needed to induce platelet 
activation, was evaluated before and after avatrombopag administration. Human platelets were identified 
as the fractions stained by anti-human CD42a. 
TRAP stimulation increased the CD62P fluorescence intensity on CD42a+ fraction at a similar level in the 
vehicle group and before and after administration of avatrombopag in the 3mg/kg/day group.  Oral 
administration of avatrombopag increased the number of human platelets, resulting in an approximately 
2.0-fold platelet count increase (P<0.05) on Day 15 after the start of administration.  In contrast, 
TRAP-induced CD62P expression in human platelets was not changed by the administration of 
avatrombopag, and results were similar to the vehicle group. These results show that avatrombopag 
enhanced human platelet proliferation in the NOD/SCID mice, but that human platelet function was not 
influenced by avatrombopag even after exposure for 2 weeks.  Furthermore, human platelets produced 
after administration of avatrombopag were considered to be as functional as those of the vehicle group, 
given that the lifespan of a human platelet is approximately 10 days. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Avatrombopag was investigated for its effects on the cardiovascular system in vitro and in vivo, and on 
respiratory, CNS, and renal function.  All pivotal safety pharmacology studies were performed in 
accordance with GLP regulations. 
IN VITRO 
The effects of avatrombopag on the hERG current were evaluated by the whole-cell patch-clamp method 
using hERG transfected HEK293 cells.  Avatrombopag at 0.1, 1, and 3 μmol/L was applied by perfusion 
onto the hERG transfected HEK293 cells.  The cells were exposed to test or control article for 15 minutes. 
Avatrombopag was shown to inhibit the hERG current with an IC50 of 1.4 μmol/L. 
The effects of avatrombopag on action potentials were evaluated by the glass microelectrode technique 
using isolated guinea pig papillary muscles.  Avatrombopag at 0.1, 1, and 3 μmol/L was applied by 
perfusion onto isolated guinea pig papillary muscles.  The tissues were exposed to test or control article 
for 45 minutes. The effects on resting membrane potentials, action potential amplitude, dV/dt max and 
action potential durations were evaluated.  Avatrombopag induced no changes in any parameters up to 
the highest concentration.).

In VIVO 
Avatrombopag was administered orally as a single dose (0, 3, 30 and 300 mg/kg) by gavage to 
unanesthetized telemetered beagle dogs to evaluate the effects on the cardiovascular and respiratory 
system. Cardiovascular (blood pressure, heart rate, and electrocardiogram) and respiratory (respiration 
rate and blood gas) effects, clinical signs, body weight, food consumption, body temperature, and 
toxicokinetics were evaluated. Avatrombopag was shown to have no effect on cardiovascular or 
respiratory function in dogs at doses up to 300 mg/kg. Vomiting was observed at ≥30 mg/kg at around 
tmax. Systemic exposure was measured up to 48 hours after dosing. The tmax was between 1 and 4 hours. 
Exposure increased dose dependently between 3 and 30 mg/kg but less than dose proportionally between 
30 and 300 mg/kg. 
Avatrombopag was administered orally by gavage as a single dose (0, 1, 10, and 100 mg/kg) to male 
F344 rats to evaluate the effects on the CNS using Irwin’s procedure.  The control group received an 
equivalent volume of vehicle (0.5% methylcellulose in water).  Animals were observed for up to 48 hours 
postdose. There were no changes in any CNS parameters with avatrombopag at doses up to 100 mg/kg. 
Avatrombopag was administered orally by gavage at a single dose (0, 3, 30, and 300 mg/kg) to male 
beagle dogs and the dogs were necropsied after 7 days.  The control group received an equivalent volume 
of control article/vehicle (0.5% methylcellulose in water).  Clinical signs, body weight, food consumption, 
renal function (glomerular filtration rate, effective renal plasma flow, and creatinine clearance), blood 
chemistry, toxicokinetics, urinalysis, and renal histopathology were evaluated. There were no deaths. 
Avatrombopag-induced changes were limited to the highest dose group (300-mg/kg) and included 
changes in fecal color or amount; increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine; decreased 
inorganic phosphate in serum; protein, glucose, ketone bodies, and occult blood in urine; increased 
urinary volume; decreased urinary osmolality; decreased glomerular filtration rate; and decreased 
effective renal plasma flow. These parameters returned to predose values by 7 days after avatrombopag 
administration. Reversible histologic lesions were also present in the renal tubules, including regeneration 
and tubular dilatation with casts and cortical mononuclear cell infiltration. No test article-related changes 
were observed at doses up to 30 mg/kg. Systemic exposure was measured up to 72 hours after dosing, 
when avatrombopag concentrations were no longer detected.  The tmax was between 2 and 3 hours, and 
exposure was similar between 30 and 300 mg/kg. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been conducted with avatrombopag as these types of 
nonclinical studies are not required based on the ICH M3(R2) guidance.  According to the EMA guideline 
on the Investigation of Drug Interactions, the potential for pharmacodynamic interactions should be 
considered for drugs which compete with each other at the pharmacological target and/or have similar or 
opposing pharmacodynamic effects and if such drugs are likely to be used concomitantly.  As this is not 
the case with avatrombopag, no pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been conducted.  
Potential pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions have been evaluated using human matrices. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Single dose pharmacokinetic studies were conducted by the intravenous and oral route of administration 
in mice, rats, dogs and cynomolgus monkeys. For repeated-dose PK, toxicokinetic (TK) results were 
utilized.  Plasma concentrations were measured by validated methods.  To evaluate the absorption, tissue 
distribution, in vivo metabolism, and excretion of avatrombopag, 14C-labeled avatrombopag 
([14C]avatrombopag) was used.  In vitro metabolism of avatrombopag was examined using liver 
microsomes and hepatocytes.  Human hepatocytes and liver microsomes were used to estimate induction 
and inhibition potencies of avatrombopag on cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms, respectively. Human 
Assessment report

transporter gene expressed cells or membrane vesicles were used to evaluate the susceptibility of 
avatrombopag to be a transport substrate, and the potential of avatrombopag to inhibit human 
transporters. 
Bioanalytical methods for avatrombopag were developed and validated by several bioanalytical 
laboratories. Methods used were state of the art HPLC-UV or LC/MS methods preceded by extraction 
methods of liquid-liquid extraction or protein precipitation. Methods were adequately validated according 
to guidelines for bioanalytical analysis of small molecule entities. 
Absorption - Single dose PK 
Single-dose pharmacokinetics in nonclinical species mouse, rat (Fischer and SD), dog and monkey were 
characterized by relatively low clearance (0.25-0.55 L/kg/h) and small volume of distribution (1-2 L/kg) 
after intravenous administration of 0.3 or 1 mg/kg avatrombopag. Terminal half-life after i.v. 
administration was similar in mice and dogs (2.7 h) and similar in rat and monkey 4.3 to 5.3 h).  
After oral administration of 0.3, 1 or 3 mg/kg, time for maximal plasma concentration was 3-4 hours in 
rodents, 2 hours in dog and 4-5 hours in monkey. Terminal half-life after oral administration was not 
calculated in mouse and dog in the study referred. In study 1045-017 PK in dog (N=16) was evaluated 
after dosing 40 mg/dog in a suspension in 0.5% methylcellulose in water. Variability was high (>66% for 
AUC and t½). Terminal half-life in dog in study 1045-017 was in the range of 3.1 to 17.8 hours. Terminal 
half-life was in the range of 3.9 to 7.2 h in rat and monkey. Bioavailability is considered to be high in 
mouse and Fischer rat (89-94%) and moderate in dog (52%) and monkey (49-67%). The dose of 1 
mg/kg seemed to be exhibiting maximal plasma concentration in the vicinity of the clinical relevant 
plasma concentration of approximately 200 ng/mL. 
A study was performed in SD rat for comparison of a solution and a suspension formulation of 
avatrombopag. In this study bioavailability was lower for both formulations as compared to the study in 
Fischer rat (solution 51% and suspension 37% in SD rat, vs approximately 90% in Fischer rat). The 
vehicle used for the solution formulation was similar in the two studies. It seems that the AUC0-inf for the 
intravenous dose is approximately twice that of the study in Fischer rat. Vd and CL is also different from 
the studies in mice and SD rat. No obvious reason was identified other than the difference in rat strain. 
Exposure after oral administration was similar between the two rat strains. Oral administration was used 
in all toxicity studies. 
A number of different vehicles have been used for dosing avatrombopag to nonclinical species by the oral 
route including tablets. In most of the submitted studies, the vehicle was 0.5% methylcellulose providing 
adequate consistency in study conduct including study 1045-017 in dog, which showed high variability in 
exposure. High variability in pharmacokinetics and exposure was also observed in dogs in the study 
including tablet formulations and e.g. in monkeys at pharmacologically relevant doses. The clinical 
relevance of the observations of high variability in exposure after oral administration in animals is 
unknown. However, avatrombopag have shown a relatively benign safety profile with adequate safety 
margin to exposure levels, which resulted in stomach findings in animals probably due to an antagonistic 
effect for the CCK2 receptor. Furthermore, it has been shown that a similar variability in exposure in 
patients is reduced by administering avatrombopag with food. 
The absorption site of avatrombopag in the gastric system was investigated in rat. Apparently duodenum 
is the site of absorption for the majority of the dose administered followed by jejunum. The stomach was 
the site of least absorption. 
In a study, in which radioactive labeled avatrombopag was dosed to Fischer rats by the oral route of 
administration, it was shown that the majority of radioactivity circulating in plasma is unchanged parent 
compound (75% of radioactive AUC0-inf).

Absorption - Repeat-dose PK 
Repeat-dose pharmacokinetics were obtained from toxicokinetics at much higher doses than clinically 
relevant and the doses used in the single dose pharmacokinetic studies. Avatrombopag is not 
pharmacologically active in either of the nonclinical species and the evaluated toxicity is therefore 
off-target toxicity.  
Plasma concentrations of avatrombopag were also determined in NOD/SCID mice transplanted with 
human bone marrow cells after once daily oral dose of avatrombopag for 14 days at the pharmacological 
effective dose of 1 mg/kg.  After the final dose, unbound (free form) plasma concentration of 
avatrombopag reached the maximum level at 8 hours postdose, and Cmax and AUC(0-24) were 29.5 ng/mL 
and 430.5 ng·h/mL, respectively. Protein binding was estimated to 89-90%, hence plasma concentration 
was in this study similar to clinical relevant pharmacological active concentrations (approximately 200 
ng/mL). 
Repeat-dose toxicokinetics in mouse was reported from a 5-day (320-1280 mg/kg/day, only males) and 
a 13-week study (80-320 mg/kg/day). TK in the 5-day study was characterised by nonlinear kinetics with 
lower dose normalised AUC for higher doses, indicating saturation of absorption at doses >320 
mg/kg/day, as TK was approximately linear with dose in the 13 week-study. Terminal half-life was 
determined to be in the range of 3.3 to 15 h indicating high variability in absorption. Male mice showed 
greater exposure than female mice in the 13-week study (28-38%). This is considered to be incidental. 
No signs of accumulation was observed in the 13-week study. Mean AUCtau in male mice at Day 90 for the 
lowest dose of 80 mg/kg/day was 182,000 ng/mL*h, 38 times higher than clinically relevant 
(approximately 4800 ng/mL*h). 
Repeat-dose toxicokinetics in rat was evaluated in two 13-week studies (5-80 mg/kg/day or 80-320 
mg/kg/day) and in one study of 26 weeks (20-160 mg/kg/day) duration. All three studies were 
characterised by a less than dose-proportional increase in exposure and consistently higher exposure in 
female compared to male rats (up to 60%). Slight accumulation was observed in the 13-week study of the 
low dose range and up to 3-4 fold in the high dose range 13-week study. In the 26-week study, 
accumulation was reported not to be higher than 2.4 from Day 1 to Day 183. Terminal half-life was 
reported for steady state in the two 13-week study to be in the range of 4.9 to 14 hours. Mean AUCtau in 
female rats on Day 183 for the lowest dose in the 26-week study was 79,600 ng/mL*h, 17 times higher 
than clinically relevant. 
Repeat-dose toxicokinetics in dog was evaluated in a 4-week study of 4 dose levels in the range of 10 to 
300 mg/kg/day. In contrast to rat, there was no sign of sex-difference in exposure. However, also in dog, 
exposure increased in a less than dose-proportional manner on Day 1. On Day 27, dose-normalised 
exposure is lowest for the mid-dose 100 mg/kg/day indicating accumulation of avatrombopag for the 
highest dose of 300 mg/kg/day in the dog and possibly saturation of clearance mechanism or toxicity in 
clearing organ(s). The dog was found susceptible to the counter-ion of avatrombopag causing kidney 
tubular necrosis, as the only nonclinical species. Therefore, the sign of accumulation of avatrombopag is 
not considered to be of concern for humans. Studies in dog of longer duration was not submitted. Mean 
(male/female) exposure of AUCtau at the lowest dose at steady state was 13,200 ng/mL*h, 2.8 times 
higher than clinically relevant. Mean AUCtau (male/female) at the highest dose showing up >3 times 
accumulation after 28 days was 376,000 ng/mL*h, 78 times higher than clinically relevant. 
Repeat-dose toxicity in monkey was evaluated in a 13-week study (1-15 mg/kg/day) and in a 52-week 
study (5-45 mg/kg/day). In the 13-week study no sex-difference in exposure was found, however in the 
52-week study, males showed slightly higher exposure than females (up to 48%). In light of the high 
variability, this could be incidental. Exposure (AUCtau) showed signs of higher than dose-proportionality at 
all sampling times (Day 1, 90, 181, 364, most pronounced at 5 and 15 mg/kg/day, probably due to limited 
absorption for the highest dose of 45 mg/kg/day. Accumulation was evaluated on Day 181 to be in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/322871/2019

range of 2 to 7-fold and did not increase at Day 364. Mean AUCtau for male at Day 364 for the lowest dose 
was 3.9 times higher than clinically relevant. 
Distribution 
The distribution of 14C-avatrombopag at a pharmacological relevant dose of 1 mg/kg was evaluated in an 
ADME study in both albino (F344/DuCrj) and pigmented rats (Long Evans). At tmax, plasma concentration 
was 74.5 ng eq./mL and 284 ng eq./mL in albino and pigmented rats, respectively. The higher 
concentration of avatrombopag in pigmented rats was consistent across tissues. These differences could 
be due to the high variability in pharmacokinetics and exposure of avatrombopag in animals and even 
patients. 
In albino rats, at plasma tmax of 1 hour, avatrombopag related radioactivity was found to be most 
abundant in stomach>liver>adrenal gland>small intestine>kidney>heart>submandibular gland>lung. 
For all these tissues, the radioactivity was lower at 24 hours compared to 1 or 4 hours. In tissues of fat, 
harderian gland and testis, radioactivity was only declining slowly or not at all between 4 and 24 hours. 
In pigmented rats, at 1 hour (plasma tmax is 4 hours), avatrombopag related radioactivity was found to be 
most abundant in liver>small intestine>stomach>adrenal gland>kidney>heart>submandibular >lung. 
For all these tissues, the radioactivity was lower at 24 hours compared to 1 or 4 hours. In tissues of eye 
ball and testis, radioactivity was only declining slowly between 4 and 24 hours. Hence the distribution of 
radioactivity related to avatrombopag was similar between albino and pigmented rat, except for the 
slower decline in concentration in eyeball of pigmented rat. This was further evaluated by determining 
radioactivity for up to 672 hours after dosing. The half-life of radioactivity was 351 hours in the eyeball. 
This finding was followed up upon in a dedicated phototoxicity study, which did not reveal any toxicity for 
doses up to 300 mg/kg avatrombopag. Testis did not seem to be affected in rat by up to 80 mg/kg/day of 
avatrombopag in the 90 days toxicity study. 
Plasma protein binding was determined by ultracentrifugation in plasma of all nonclinical species and 
humans (ME03171). Plasma protein binding was found to be moderate in rodents and rabbit 
(87.2-92.0%) and higher in dog, monkey and human (96.3-97.9%). The binding was not concentration 
dependent in the range of 0.05 to 50 µg/mL. 
14C-Avatrombopag distribution into blood cells was evaluated in blood of all nonclinical species and 
humans (AE-7539-G). Blood to plasma ratio RB was not concentration dependent in the range of 50 to 
5000 ng/mL. RB was similar in rodents, monkey and human (0.57 to 0.66), slightly lower in dog 
(0.51-0.52) and higher in rabbit (0.82-0.83). 
Placental transfer was investigated after a single oral dose of 14C-avatrombopag (3 mg/kg) to pregnant 
SD rats (AE-7538-G). The ratios of radioactive concentrations to maternal plasma on Days 13 and 18 of 
pregnancy up to 24 hours post dose were evaluated.  
It  can  be  concluded  that  avatrombopag  related  radioactivity  is  lower  in  foetus  compared  to  maternal 
plasma in all tissues (ratio 0.12-0.40), hence placental transfer is evident, although limited. 
In vitro metabolism 
14C-avatrombopag was relatively stable in both liver microsomes and hepatocytes indicating low first pass 
metabolism in vivo. Metabolites identified in human preparations were also present in preparations from 
nonclinical species, i.e. 3- and 4-hydroxylated avatrombopag.  
CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 were found to be the main contributors to the CYP-mediated metabolism of 
avatrombopag in pooled human liver microsomes being responsible for 4-hydroxy cis metabolite and the 
4 hydroxy trans metabolite, respectively. Formation of 3-hydroxyavatrombopag was minor in all 
incubation and the responsible metabolic enzyme was not identified. 
Assessment report

In vivo metabolism 
14C-avatrombopag (10 mg/kg) was administered to SD rats by the oral or the intravenous route. Analysis 
of bile samples revealed the presence of unchanged 14C-avatrombopag and up to 26 quantifiable 
metabolites. The major radioactive metabolite in bile was M46 (avatrombopag taurine conjugate) 
following both dosing routes. This metabolite accounted for 2.25% and 11.6% of the radioactive dose in 
orally and intravenously dosed male rats, respectively.  
Radioactivity excreted in faeces consisted of 3 metabolites (oral dose) or 2 metabolites (intravenous 
dose), in addition to unchanged parent drug. Unchanged parent, 14C-avatrombopag, was the primary 
radiolabelled component in faeces and accounted for 68.0 and 8.30% of the radioactivity in orally and 
intravenously dosed male BDC rats, respectively. Analysis of urine found up to 31 quantifiable 
metabolites, each representing no more than 0.16 and 0.48% of the dose following oral or intravenous 
dosing, respectively. No unchanged parent was detected in urine. 
CYP induction 
Avatrombopag was incubated with hepatocytes from 3 different donors at concentrations from 1 to 20 
µmol/L for three days by daily addition of avatrombopag. mRNA from individual CYPs was extracted from 
incubations and quantified vs vehicle (0.1% DMSO) or positive controls. The most prominent results 
obtained was that avatrombopag appeared to induce CYP3A4, however to a lesser degree than the 
positive control and inhibit the formation of mRNA of CYP1A2 at the highest dose down to 12% of vehicle 
control. This inhibition seemed to be dose-related. Classical CYP inhibition studies showed no potential for 
inhibition of CYP1A2 and treatment is only for 5 days, hence if a down regulation does happen in vivo, it 
will only be temporary and likely not clinically relevant. 
CYP inhibition 
Avatrombopag potential for CYP inhibition was evaluated using recombinant CYP isoforms or pooled 
human liver microsomes. No results indicated concerns for CYP inhibition by avatrombopag as all IC50s 
came out above 10 µmol/L. Avatrombopag did not show potential for time dependent inhibition of  
CYP2C9, 2D6 or 3A either. 
Excretion into urine, bile and faeces 
Two studies were conducted to evaluate excretion of radioactive labelled avatrombopag in rats. One study 
was dosing 1 mg/kg to rats by the oral route evaluating urine, faeces and bile. A second study of excretion 
of avatrombopag was evaluated by dosing 14C-avatrombopag 10 mg/kg to rats by both the oral or 
intravenous route. Excretion into urine, bile and faeces was evaluated. This study confirmed results from 
the first study. Results from the second study showed that the main route of excretion after oral 
administration was faeces with 82.8% of the dose after 120 hours followed by bile and urine with 8.1 and 
2.98%, respectively. The main route of excretion after the intravenous route was bile with 45.6% 
followed by faeces and urine with 11.1 and 3.66%, respectively. It should be noted here that the rats 
administered avatrombopag by the intravenous route was euthanized after 26 hours due to necrosis in 
tails, hence 35% of the radioactivity was still retained in the carcasses at end of study. Also, at least 
11.1% of the dose was excreted into the gastrointestinal tract by non-biliary route(s). 
Excretion into breast milk 
14C-Avatrombopag was dosed 3 mg/kg by the oral route of administration to lactating SD rats. The 
radioactive concentration profile in milk was similar to plasma, with an exposure ratio of avatrombopag 
related radioactivity (milk to plasma) of 0.94, indicating that avatrombopag is secreted into milk, 
however with no direct indication of accumulation. The major component of radioactivity in milk was 
avatrombopag.

Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
CYP inhibition and induction is presented above under metabolism. 
Avatrombopag was evaluated for interaction with a range of efflux transporters. Avatrombopag was 
demonstrated to be a P-gp substrate, but not a substrate of BCRP, BSEP or MRP2. Avatrombopag was  a 
weak inhibitor of P-gp (IC50 > 30 micromolar), however IC50 for BCRP, BSEP and MRP2 were lower; 5.4, 
2.7 and 6.7 micromolar, respectively. This finding is of no clinical relevance. 
In one study, Avatrombopag was evaluated for being a substrate or an inhibitor of the transporters 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3. Avatrombopag was apparently not a substrate of these 
transporters but may show inhibitory potential, since avatrombopag showed a weak inhibition of the 
transport of probe substrates for OATP1B1 (IC50:  22.1 µmol/L) and OCT2 (IC50 >30 µmol/L), and 
moderate to potent inhibition of the transport of probe substrates for OATP1B3 (IC50:  2.8 µmol/L), OAT1 
(IC50:  0.7 µmol/L), and OAT3 (IC50:  0.2 µmol/L). 
In another study, Avatrombopag was demonstrated not to be a substrate of OATP2B1 or OATP1A2, but 
showed inhibitory potential of OCT1 with IC50 of 2.09 micromolar. Inhibition of OCT1 could be one of the 
reasons for the nonlinear kinetics in repeat dose toxicity studies by inhibiting uptake in the liver and 
thereby delay elimination. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
The minimum lethal dose by a single oral dose was identified to be 1000 mg/kg in rats and greater than 
2000 mg/kg in cynomolgus monkeys. In rats administered ≥1000 mg/kg dose, clinical signs preceding 
death included staggering gaits, decreased locomotor activity, soft faeces, and oligopnea. In cynomolgus 
monkeys, avatrombopag was tolerated at doses up to 2000 mg/kg with toxicologic changes including 
vomiting and soft stool. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
The primary toxicity of avatrombopag was identified as dose-related changes in the stomach in 
repeated-dose studies in mice, rats, and cynomolgus monkeys. The histologic change in the fundic glands 
of the stomach was characterized by primary degeneration of the glandular epithelium with a decrease in 
matured parietal cells, with accompanying regenerative epithelial hyperplasia particularly in mice, and 
atrophy of glandular mucosa without inflammatory responses in rats and cynomolgus monkeys.  This 
effect was not associated with an inflammatory response or any evidence of erosion or ulcer formation.  
These changes were also accompanied by decreases in the gastric acid output with accompanying 
elevation in intragastric pH and compensatory hypergastrinemia in all of these species.  These stomach 
lesions were dose-, plasma concentration-, and duration-dependent.  
Histologic changes in the stomach induced by avatrombopag were identified to be due to systemic rather 
than local exposures.  The gastric changes showed a clear trend towards recovery after dosing was 
stopped.  Systemic exposures at no observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) in all of the pivotal studies 
were sufficiently above the clinical exposures at the maximum recommended human dose under the 
intended clinical regimen. 
Reversible skeletal muscle degeneration/necrosis was observed in F344 rats (but not in SD rats) and 
cynomolgus monkeys. However, these findings were not consistent and limited to the short duration (up 
to 4 weeks) studies, with no lesions observed in any species that received avatrombopag for 13 weeks 
and longer, even though skeletal muscles were examined extensively with additional tissue collection 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/322871/2019 
Page 29/123 
 
 
 
from multiple sites with additional parameters in biochemistry in mice, SD rats, dogs, and monkeys.  
There have been no adverse events that indicate skeletal muscle effects in clinical studies.  These results 
indicate that avatrombopag is unlikely to pose any risk of skeletal muscle toxicity in humans.   
In dogs, reversible renal toxicity was observed at high doses in the kidney in 4-week repeated-dose 
study.  The changes included increases in BUN, creatinine, urinary protein, and urinary volume, 
decreased glomerular filtration rate and effective plasma flow, accompanied by histologic changes 
(epithelial cell regeneration of proximal tubules).  In the dog, it may be possible that maleic acid, the salt 
moiety of avatrombopag which is known to cause similar lesions in dogs (tubular necrosis in proximal 
tubules), could have played a role in these renal changes since dogs are known to be susceptible to maleic 
acids (Everett, et al., 1993; Fiume, 2007).  No renal changes were seen in the repeated-dose toxicity 
studies in mice, rats, or monkeys, and there have been no significant adverse events in kidneys and renal 
functions in clinical studies. 
Genotoxicity 
A reverse mutation assay was conducted with avatrombopag using the Ames test with the pre-incubation 
method in bacterial strains of Salmonella typhimurium TA100, TA1535, TA98, and TA1537 and 
Escherichia coli WP2 uvrA[pKM101].  There was no increase in the number of revertants observed up to 
the highest concentration in any bacterial strains. 
An in vitro chromosomal aberration test was conducted with avatrombopag in human lymphocytes. No 
significant difference in the avatrombopag-treated group compared to the negative control group was 
detected on structural or numerical chromosomal aberration up to the highest concentration. 
An in vivo micronucleus test was conducted with avatrombopag given orally for 2 days to SD rats at doses 
of 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg in males, and 70, 200, 600, and 2000 mg/kg in females. The 2000 mg/kg dose 
group was excluded from data evaluation because of the death of 1 of the 5 females before the second 
administration. TK analysis was performed.  Bone marrow collected at 24 hours after the final 
administration of avatrombopag was examined for determination of incidences of micronucleated 
polychromatic erythrocytes (MNPCEs) and the percentage of polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs) in the 
total erythrocytes. There was no avatrombopag-induced increase in the incidences of MNPCEs or 
percentage of PCEs at up to the maximum 100 mg/kg for males and 600 mg/kg for females. In the TK 
analysis, the avatrombopag Cmax and AUC(0-24) increased with dose. There were no apparent sex 
differences. 
Carcinogenicity 
In the 2-year carcinogenicity studies in mice (20, 60, 160 mg/kg) and rats (20, 50, 160 mg/kg), 
neuroendocrine cell (enterochromaffin-like [ECL] cell) hyperplasia (rats only, 50 and 160 mg/kg), and 
ECL cell tumors (carcinoids, both rats [160 mg/kg] and mice [60 and 160 mg/kg]) occurred in the 
stomach, in addition to changes similar to those observed in repeated-dose studies.  It is generally well 
accepted that hypergastrinemia-related gastric carcinoids in rodents are of low risk/relevance to humans 
(Berlin, 1991).  No tumors were observed at doses up to 20 mg/kg in mice (14-times the human exposure 
[AUC: 4820 ng∙h/mL] based on AUC at highest clinical dose of 60 mg) and 50 mg/kg in rats (48-times the 
human exposure based on AUC). 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Avatrombopag has shown to have no effect on male and female fertility or early embryogenesis in rats at 
doses up to 100 mg/kg (22-times the human exposure based on AUC). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/322871/2019 
Page 30/123 
 
 
 
There were no embryo-fetal effects noted in rats or rabbits that were administered avatrombopag during 
organogenesis at doses up to 100 mg/kg or 600 mg/kg, respectively (35- to 53-times the human 
exposure based on AUC). 
PPND studies in rats revealed the NOAEL for F0 maternal toxicity as 50 mg/kg, the NOAEL for F1 
developmental/neonatal toxicity and early postnatal development as 15 mg/kg (reduced postnatal 
survival and body weights with corresponding secondary changes in both sexes at 50 mg/kg), and the 
NOAEL for F1 male and female neurobehavior and reproductive toxicity as 50 mg/kg. 
Avatrombopag was administered orally by gavage once a day to juvenile SD rats (5/sex/group main 
study, 10 mL/kg) at doses of 10, 100, 300, 600 or 1000 mg/kg (as maleate salt, given in 2 phases, first 
at 10, 100, and 300 mg/kg and second at 600 and 1000 mg/kg) from PND7, and the animals necropsied 
after 4 weeks.  Additional rats (24/sex/group, 3/sex/group/timepoint) were administered avatrombopag 
in the same manner for TK analysis. There were no deaths, avatrombopag-related clinical signs, or 
significant changes in blood chemistry, gross pathology, or mean kidney and liver weights.  There were 
lower body weight gains with lower food intake at avatrombopag doses ≥600 mg/kg.  In histology, gastric 
mucosal changes similar to those observed in adults were observed at doses ≥100 mg/kg.  There were 
dose-dependent red blood cell parameter alterations indicative of iron deficiency anaemia at 
avatrombopag doses ≥300 mg/kg; these are known to be associated with the gastric changes in juvenile 
rats.  There was also an increase in the incidence and/or severity of background basophilic renal tubules 
at the 1000 mg/kg avatrombopag dose. No test article-related changes were observed at 10 mg/kg of 
avatrombopag. Systemic avatrombopag exposure increased less than dose-proportionally with doses 
from 10 to 1000 mg/kg, and was generally similar over the 300 to 1000 mg/kg/ range.  In general, there 
were no sex differences in AUC(0-last), although exposure in females was slightly higher.  Exposure was 
generally higher on PND34 in animals at the 600 and 1000 mg/kg avatrombopag doses. 
Local Tolerance  
The primary skin irritation potential of avatrombopag was assessed in male Japanese White rabbits. A 0.5 
g dose of avatrombopag (as maleate salt) moistened with 0.7 mL of water for injection was applied to the 
skin for 4 hours by semi-occlusive procedures, and observed for 72 hours after the application. No skin 
reactions were observed in any of the animals with avatrombopag. 
The eye irritation potential of avatrombopag was assessed in male Japanese White rabbits.  A 0.013 g 
dose of avatrombopag (as maleate salt, approximately 0.1 mL) was applied to the eye, and observed for 
4 days after the application.  For the animals in the eye-washed group, the treated eye was rinsed for 
30 seconds with isotonic sodium chloride solution from 30 seconds after the application. Slight 
conjunctival redness was observed in 2 animals in the eye-unwashed group at 1 hour after the 
application, which disappeared by 24 hours.  No ocular reactions were observed in any animals in the 
eye-washed group.  Maximum mean total score by Draize’s method was 1.3 for eye-unwashed group, and 
avatrombopag was classified as “practically nonirritating”. 
Other toxicity studies 
The mutagenic potential for 12 possible impurities in avatrombopag active pharmaceutical ingredient 
(API), including starting materials, intermediates, and others, were assessed. Two impurities were found 
to be positive by an in silico method. One, namely Ethyl isonipecotate showed inconclusive result in the 
Ames test. The level of each genotoxic impurity as well as the total level of multiple genotoxic impurities 
was controlled at a level well below the upper limit of 0.2% according to the ICH M7 guideline. 
Avatrombopag (160 or 320 mg/kg, as maleate salt) was given orally by gavage for 4 weeks to CD-1 mice.  
Avatrombopag induced dose-dependent degeneration of the glandular epithelium including parietal cells,

and the expected elevation in serum gastrin levels; this elevation was considered to be associated with 
the primary decreases in mature parietal cells in the stomach. 
Avatrombopag (0, 160, or 320 mg/kg, as maleate salt) was given orally by gavage to female SD rats for 
4 weeks.  Avatrombopag induced dose-dependent degeneration of the glandular epithelium including 
parietal cells, decreases in gastric acid secretion, increases in intragastric pH, and the expected elevation 
in serum gastrin levels.  The decrease in mature parietal cells was considered to be the primary cause of 
decreased gastric acid secretion with increased intragastric pH, leading to the subsequent compensatory 
hypergastrinemia. 
Avatrombopag was administered as a single oral dose of 20, 160 or 600 mg/kg or an intraduodenal dose 
of 600 mg/kg (as maleate salt) to female SD rats.  Systemic exposure-dependent histologic changes were 
observed in the fundic gland regardless of the route of avatrombopag administration in animals at 160 
and 600 mg/kg avatrombopag dose groups by oral administration or at 600 mg/kg by intraduodenal 
administration. In contrast, no histologic changes were observed with an oral avatrombopag dose of 
20 mg/kg that resulted in the lowest level of systemic exposure.  It was concluded that histologic changes 
in the stomach induced by avatrombopag treatment were due to systemic rather than local exposures. 
Potential phototoxic effects on the eyes and skin were assessed in pigmented Long-Evans male rats 
(5/group) after a single oral administration of avatrombopag at doses of 0 (vehicle control), 3, 30, or 300 
mg/kg followed by a 4-hour exposure to visible, ultraviolet A (UVA), and ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation. The 
positive control group received 50 mg/kg 8 methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) and was similarly irradiated for 1 
hour.  Evaluation included mortality, clinical observations, body weights, skin responses, ophthalmology, 
and microscopic pathology of the eyes. There were no mortalities.  There were no skin reactions in the 
pigmented skin sites or in the ophthalmological evaluation or histopathology of the eyes at any 
avatrombopag dose for up to 72 hours after simulated sunlight exposure. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
A partition coefficient study was performed using the shake flask method with HPLC analysis. At 
approximately 25ºC, Log D values of avatrombopag maleate at pH 3.1, 5.4, 7.1 and 9.3 were >4.5, >4.5, 
>4.5 and 4.1, respectively (ionic strength I = 0.3). This study was followed by a partition coefficient 
study, which was performed using the slow-stirring method (OECD Test Guideline 123) with HPLC 
analysis. At 25ºC, the Log D value of avatrombopag maleate at pH 7.1 was >4.5 (ionic strength I = 0.3). 
In a GLP-compliant ready biodegradability study (OECD 301F), avatrombopag maleate was found not to 
be readily biodegradable. 
On the basis that Log D has been found to be greater than 4.5 using the shake flask and slow-stirring 
methods and avatrombopag maleate was not readily biodegradable, avatrombopag maleate will be 
further screened in a step-wise procedure for persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity (PBT), in 
accordance with the CHMP Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for 
Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2, 01 June 2006). 
The applicant performed the log Kow screening in accordance with the CHMP Guideline on the 
Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00, 01 
June 2006), the log Kow was above 4.5. 
A refined Fpen was calculated based on the estimated prevalence of all patients with thrombocytopenia 
and liver disease in Europe which is 36.1 per 10,000 population equating to a prevalence (P) value of 
0.00361. The number of avatrombopag treatment periods per patient could be estimated from 1 to 3 
treatments per year. The refinement based on treatment regime, taking the worst-case number of 
treatment repetitions of 3 into account, is appropriate and in line with the Q&A on ERA 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/322871/2019 
Page 32/123 
 
 
 
(EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010 Rev. 1, question 4). Avatrombopag is intended for short term 
administration and the 5-day dosing is reflected in the proposed SmPC. Values supporting the calculation 
of Refined Fpen are detailed below.  
The maximum daily dose (DOSEai) is 60 mg for 5 consecutive days for each treatment period, and there 
may be up to 3 treatment periods per year. The calculation of the PECSURFACEWATER is shown below 
with the values supporting the calculation provided.  
The PECSURFACEWATER is 0.0045 μg/L for avatrombopag. This represents a worst-case calculation of 
PECSURFACEWATER. As this value is well below the action limit of 0.01 μg/L, a Phase II evaluation is not 
required.

However, the

In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points to be addressed: 
A step-wise PBT assessment post-marketing: 
• 
Persistence (P): Persistence will be assessed in a GLP-compliant OECD 308 study of aerobic 
transformation in freshwater aquatic sediment systems. 
•  Bioaccumulation (B): Bioaccumulation will be assessed in a GLP-compliant OECD 305 fish 
bioaccumulation study. 
• 
Toxicity (T): As stated in Section 1.2.3 of Guideline EMA/CVMP/ERA/52740/2012: “For animal 
welfare reasons it is recommended that the evaluation of persistence and bioaccumulation is 
carried out first. When the criteria for persistence and/or bioaccumulation are not met, there is no 
requirement to carry out evaluation of the T criterion within the PBT assessment.”  
•  Available mammalian toxicity data for avatrombopag show no evidence of any endocrine 
disruption or mutagenicity, and no evidence of other toxicities indicative of environmental risk, 
based on secondary pharmacodynamics (lack of significant binding to 86 receptors, transporters 
or ion channels) and repeat dose toxicity, reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity data. 
The applicant therefore proposes to provide, as a post-marketing commitment, an updated ERA after the 
OECD 305 and 308 studies have been performed with an assessment of: 
•  Whether avatrombopag does or does not fulfil the P or vP criteria, as detailed in Guideline 
EMA/CVMP/ERA/52740/2012. 
•  Whether avatrombopag does or does not fulfil the B or vB criteria, as detailed in Guideline 
EMA/CVMP/ERA/52740/2012. 
•  Whether or not there is considered to be a need to carry out evaluation of the T criterion within 
the PBT assessment, as detailed in Guideline EMA/CVMP/ERA/52740/2012. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
A range of in vitro pharmacology studies have been conducted to characterise receptor binding and 
pharmacological activity. Avatrombopag appears to stimulate cell proliferation via the thrombopoietin 
receptor (c-Mpl) and differentiation of megakaryocytes from Human CB CD34+ Cells, but avatrombopag 
did not affect the differentiation of non-megakaryocytic lineages human hematopoietic progenitor cells. 
Suggesting that avatrombopag stimulates human hematopoietic progenitor cells to specifically 
differentiate into megakaryocytes. Furthermore, avatrombopag appears to stimulate maturation of 
megakaryocytes in a similar degree as rhTPO with regards to ploidy level. Avatrombopag and TPO 
appears to have an additive effect in G-CSF-mobilized human PB CD34+ cells when giving avatrombopag 
in combination with 3 nmol/L rhTPO. 
Limited in vivo studies have been conducted as avatrombopag appears only to be pharmacological active 
in humans and chimpanzees. Avatrombopag does not stimulate platelet production in mice, rats, 
monkeys, or dogs because of the unique TPO receptor specificity. Therefore, data from these animal 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/322871/2019 
Page 34/123 
 
 
 
 
studies do not fully model potential adverse effects related to platelet count increases due to 
avatrombopag in humans. Safety pharmacology has been addressed in classical in vitro studies as well as 
in vivo studies dogs and rats. 
Avatrombopag was shown to bind to c-Mpl on human platelets without affecting rhTPO binding to c-Mpl on 
human platelets. Investigation of binding site of avatrombopag indicate that avatrombopag binds to CRH2 
and/or ICD whereas TPO is known to bind to the CRH1 domain of c-Mpl. Thus, supporting that 
avatrombopag does not affect binding of TPO to c-Mpl. Further investigation of binding site of 
avatrombopag revealed that binding might be related to the transmembrane part of c-Mpl. This supports 
the finding of a very species specific pharmacological effect as the transmembrane part of c-Mpl is only 
conserved between Chimpanzee and humans among the tested species as His499 only exists in humans 
and chimpanzees but not in other species. 
No non-clinical data was provided on the evaluation of avatrombopag for interaction with IFN-alfa and 
IFN-gamma receptors. The argumentation being that interferon is not a standard therapy for hepatitis C 
infection any longer, as also supported e.g. by the EASL Recommendations on Treatment of Hepatitis C 
(2018). Therefore it is acceptable that no further investigations pertaining to the interaction of 
avatrombopag with interferon preparations are undertaken. However, it is conceivable that patients could 
be prescribed interferon for reasons other than ribavirin treatment, therefore a warning statement was 
included into section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
The effect of avatrombopag on hERG Potassium Currents is not considered clinical relevant as the steady 
state plasma concentration in patients is expected to be 0.3µmol/L. Avatrombopag induced no changes in 
any parameters up to the highest concentration (1.37 μmol/L) tested, when investigating effects on 
action potentials by the glass microelectrode technique using isolated guinea pig papillary muscles. 
Cardiovascular and respiratory safety pharmacology was studied in dogs, where avatrombopag appeared 
to have no effect. Central nervous system safety pharmacology was studied in rats and no changes were 
seen with avatrombopag. Renal safety pharmacology was studied in dogs. Avatrombopag at the highest 
dose (300 mg/kg) induced functional effects in the kidneys, which was not seen at 30mg/kg. The 
exposure seen at 30mg/kg (AUC 43.736 ng·h/mL) is approximate 9 times higher than the human 
exposure seen at 60mg dose (AUC 4820 ng·h/mL).  
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been conducted with avatrombopag. The lack of 
pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies is acceptable, as the most relevant interaction is considered to 
be with rhTPO and this has been addressed in the primary pharmacodynamics studies. 
A comprehensive range of studies were conducted to characterise the pharmacokinetics and ADME 
properties of avatrombopag. This was done using validated bioanalytical methods for quantitative 
determination of “cold” and radioactive labelled avatrombopag. In vitro metabolism, induction and 
inhibition potential of avatrombopag was thoroughly investigated using systems of microsomes, primary 
hepatocytes and cell lines expressing human CYPs or transporters. 
Avatrombopag appeared to induce CYP3A4, however to a lesser degree than the positive control and 
inhibit the formation of mRNA of CYP1A2 at the highest dose down to 12% of vehicle control. This 
inhibition seemed to be dose-related. Classical CYP inhibition studies showed no potential for inhibition of 
CYP1A2 and treatment is only for 5 days, hence if a down regulation does happen in vivo, it will only be 
temporary and likely not clinically relevant. 
No results indicated concerns for CYP inhibition by avatrombopag as all IC50s came out above 10 µmol/L. 
Avatrombopag did not show potential for time dependent inhibition of CYP2C9, 2D6 or 3A either. 
Avatrombopag was evaluated for interaction with a range of efflux transporters. Avatrombopag was 
demonstrated to be a P-gp substrate, but not a substrate of BCRP, BSEP or MRP2. Avatrombopag was a 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/322871/2019 
Page 35/123 
 
 
 
weak inhibitor of P-gp (IC50 > 30 micromolar), however IC50 for BCRP, BSEP and MRP2 were lower; 5.4, 
2.7 and 6.7 micromolar, respectively. This finding is not considered clinically relevant. 
Avatrombopag was apparently not a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3 transporters 
but may show inhibitory potential, since avatrombopag showed a weak inhibition of the transport of probe 
substrates for OATP1B1 and OCT2, and moderate to potent inhibition of the transport of probe substrates 
for OATP1B3, OAT1 and OAT3 (IC50:  0.2 µmol/L). In SmPC section 5.2, avatrombopag is described as 
being an inhibitor of OAT1 and OAT3 in vitro. 
Avatrombopag was demonstrated not to be a substrate of OATP2B1 or OATP1A2, however showed 
inhibitory potential of OCT1. Inhibition of OCT1 could be one of the reasons for the nonlinear kinetics in 
repeat dose toxicity studies by inhibiting uptake in the liver and thereby delay elimination. However, 
inhibition of OCT1 is not expected to occur in patients, since IC50 is well above clinical relevant plasma 
concentrations (total concentration). 
Overall the toxicology studies are not able to predict risks related to the pharmacological effect of 
avatrombopag as avatrombopag appears only to be pharmacologically active in humans and chimpanzee. 
This is a limitation to the nonclinical packaged, but it is accepted as no nonclinical models are available 
that could be used (toxicologic evaluation in chimpanzees is not viable for ethical reasons based on EU 
Directive 2010/63/EU). The off-target effects of avatrombopag have been investigated in species 
commonly used in toxicology studies, including mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys. From all species tested, 
rats and monkeys were found to be the most sensitive, and these 2 species were, therefore, used for the 
chronic toxicology studies. 
All pivotal toxicology studies were performed in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) 
regulations.  
Avatrombopag was administered orally, which is the intended route for clinical use (except for the local 
tolerance studies and 1 mechanistic study for gastric toxicity in rats). 
Repeated dose toxicology studies have been conducted in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys. However, the 
rat and the monkey was the main toxicological species. The repeated dose toxicity studies are all 
conducted in species where avatrombopag is not pharmacological active. Overall, there were two 
avatrombopag related findings of importance.  
The primary finding was dose-related changes in the stomach in repeated-dose studies in mice, rats, and 
cynomolgus monkeys. The histologic changes in the fundic glands of the stomach were characterised by 
primary degeneration of the glandular epithelium with a decrease in matured parietal cells, with 
accompanying regenerative epithelial hyperplasia particularly in mice, and atrophy of glandular mucosa 
without inflammatory responses in rats and cynomolgus monkeys. These stomach lesions were dose-, 
plasma concentration-, and duration-dependent. The findings are considered human relevant as they 
were seen across more species. The lowest safety margins were seen in the 52 week study in monkeys 
with a safety margin of 3. The changes appeared to be reversible in monkeys and rats. 
Alterations in blood cell parameters were apparent as relatively mild thrombocytopenia in F344 and SD 
rats,  mild  lymphocytopenia  in  male  Beagle  dogs  and  slight  anaemic  changes  in  female  cynomolgus 
monkeys. 
Skeletal muscle changes were also observed, but only in F344 rats and cynomolgus monkeys. Moreover, 
these findings were reversible and limited to the short duration (up to 4 weeks) studies and in clinical 
studies there have been no adverse events that indicate skeletal muscle abnormalities. All these results 
indicate that avatrombopag is unlikely to pose any risk of skeletal muscle toxicity in humans. 
In dogs renal toxicity was observed. The renal findings were characterised by regeneration of tubules, and 
cast formation in tubules as well as degeneration/necrosis of tubules, vacuolar degeneration of tubules

EMA/CHMP/322871/2019 
Page 36/123 
 
 
 
and dilatation of tubules. The renal findings appear to be reversible and with a safety margin of 7. The 
renal finding in dogs might be related to maleic acid, the salt moiety of avatrombopag. 
Avatrombopag appears not to be genotoxic in all bacterial strains tested (Salmonella typhimurium TA100, 
TA1535, TA98, and TA1537 and Escherichia coli WP2 uvrA[pKM101]) either in the presence or absence of 
S9 mix. It is noted that precipitation was seen at doses of 78.1 µg/plate and the relevance of higher 
concentrations is unknown. Avatrombopag tested negative in both an in vitro chromosomal aberration 
test in human lymphocytes and in vivo micronucleus assay in rats. 
Malignant neuroendocrine cell tumours were seen in both mice (mid and high dose) and rats (high dose) 
with exposure multiples to human exposure of 14 and 48, respectively, for the doses with no neoplastic 
changes. The neoplastic changes seen in the carcinogenicity studies are most likely related to the 
antisecretory properties of avatrombopag resulting in nongenotoxic and rodent-specific neoplastic 
changes. Overall, the safety margins for carcinogenicity are considered adequate, especially considering 
the 5-day treatment regimen in patients. 
Avatrombopag appears to have no effect on male and female fertility or early embryogenesis in rats. 
There were no embryo-fetal effects in rats or rabbits that were administered avatrombopag during 
organogenesis. PPND studies in rats showed reduced postnatal survival when pups were exposed to 
avatrombopag. The findings were present at doses with no maternal toxicity. There were no effects on 
postnatal development. The NOAEL for the PPND study was set to 15mg/kg, which is approximately a 13 
fold higher exposure than the clinically relevant exposure. Avatrombopag is not recommended during 
pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception (see SmPC). 
A dose-range finding study was conducted in juvenile rats. The DRF study revealed avatrombopag related 
changes in the stomach at doses of ≥100 mg/kg. These findings were similar to the ones in the repeated 
dose toxicity studies. 
Three mechanistic gastric toxicity studies were conducted to investigative the mechanism behind the 
gastric toxicity. One study was conducted in mice and two studies in rats. Findings were somewhat similar 
to the effects of Omeprazole. However, there were discrepancies. This indicates that the gastric toxicity 
might be linked to the reduced intragastric pH, which appears to be related to systemic exposure rather 
than local exposure. 
No avatrombopag related reactions were seen in the skin irritation and ocular irritation studies. 
Two impurities were found to be positive by an in silico method. On the basis of ICH M7 and Q3A, the risk 
of carcinogenicity by the specified impurities in avatrombopag API is considered to be negligible. 
The log Kow was above 4.5 and results of a GLP-compliant ready biodegradability study demonstrated 
that avatrombopag maleate was not readily biodegradable. Therefore, further screening in a step-wise 
procedure for persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity (PBT) is required. In accordance with the 
Guideline on the assessment of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) or very persistent (vP) and 
very bioaccumulative (vB) substances in veterinary medicinal products (EMA/CVMP/ERA/52740/2012), 
the Applicant will perform a step-wise PBT assessment post-marketing: 
Persistence (P): Persistence will be assessed in a GLP-compliant OECD 308 study of aerobic 
transformation in freshwater aquatic sediment systems. 
Bioaccumulation (B): Bioaccumulation will be assessed in a GLP-compliant OECD 305 fish 
bioaccumulation study. 
Toxicity (T): As stated in Section 1.2.3 of Guideline EMA/CVMP/ERA/52740/2012: “For animal welfare 
reasons it is recommended that the evaluation of persistence and bioaccumulation is carried out first. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/322871/2019 
Page 37/123 
 
 
 
When the criteria for persistence and/or bioaccumulation are not met, there is no requirement to carry out 
evaluation of the T criterion within the PBT assessment.”  
Available mammalian toxicity data for avatrombopag show no evidence of any endocrine disruption or 
mutagenicity, and no evidence of other toxicities indicative of environmental risk, based on secondary 
pharmacodynamics (lack of significant binding to 86 receptors, transporters or ion channels) and repeat 
dose toxicity, reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity data. 
The applicant therefore proposes to provide, as a post-marketing commitment, an updated ERA after the 
OECD 305 and 308 studies have been performed with an assessment of: 
Whether avatrombopag does or does not fulfil the P or vP criteria, as detailed in Guideline 
EMA/CVMP/ERA/52740/2012. 
Whether avatrombopag does or does not fulfil the B or vB criteria, as detailed in Guideline 
EMA/CVMP/ERA/52740/2012. 
Whether or not there is considered to be a need to carry out evaluation of the T criterion within the PBT 
assessment, as detailed in Guideline EMA/CVMP/ERA/52740/2012. 
The calculated refined PEC surfacewater was below the trigger value and therefore Phase II evaluation was not 
performed. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Effects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the 
maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use. The primary toxicity of 
avatrombopag in pivotal repeated dose studies was in the stomach at high doses with adequate safety 
margins when compared to the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose; these effects were 
reversible even in the chronic toxicity studies. 
Overall, it is noted that avatrombopag is not pharmacologically active in any of the species used in the 
nonclinical studies and therefore the nonclinical package cannot predict the risks related to the 
pharmacological effect of avatrombopag. However, the non-clinical data submitted support the approval 
of avatrombopag. 
The applicant is recommended to complete an OECD 308 study of aerobic transformation in freshwater 
aquatic sediment systems and OECD 305 fish bioaccumulation study, and submit an updated ERA.

Pivotal and Supportive Efficacy Studies: 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Avatrombopag is an orally administered, small molecule (ie, nonpeptide) thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor 
agonist that mimics the biologic effects of TPO in vitro and in vivo. The avatrombopag clinical 
pharmacology program includes a total of 19 studies: 15 Phase 1 studies, 2 Phase 2 studies, and 2 Phase 
3 studies.   
Models and validation 
All 15 Phase 1 studies, 2 Phase 2 studies (Study 202 and Study 204) and 2 Phase 3 studies (Study 310 
and Study 311) contributed clinical pharmacology information for this marketing application. A population 
PK analysis of data pooled from all the Phase 1 studies, and Study 202, Study 204, Study 310, and Study 
311 provided information on the effect of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on PK. Studies were performed to 
examine the intrinsic effects of race on the PK and PD of avatrombopag in healthy Japanese, Chinese, and 
white subjects.  The effect of food on the PK, exposure, and bioavailability (BA) of avatrombopag were 
also studied.  Analyses of interactions between avatrombopag and P-gp inhibitors or CYP, namely CYP2C9 
and CYP3A modulators were also performed. 
A comprehensive PK/PD analysis of data pooled from Study 202, Study 204, Study 310 and Study 311 
examined the relationship between avatrombopag concentration and platelet counts, and avatrombopag 
concentration and QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia’s formula (QTcF). 
Overall, all PK and PK/PD models were validated and found to integrate data acceptably to permit 
predictions. One notable exception was the model to predict the effect of avatrombopag on the QTc 
interval. The PK/PD relationship for avatrombopag exposure and ddQTcF could not be adequately 
modelled and thus no credible modelling predictions regarding impact on the QTc interval could be made.

ADME 
Absorption 
Proportionality between dose and Cmax or AUC, respectively, was observed until a dose of 75 mg. With 
increased dosing (based on data from only 1 additional dose of 100 mg) a plateau appeared to be reached. 
The proposed posology of 40-60 mg once daily falls within the range where dose proportionality was 
demonstrated. Tmax was approximately 4-6.5 hours with no apparent dose dependency. Terminal T½ 
appeared equally dose independent and was approximately 18-24 hours. Bioavailability was an estimated 
minimum of 44%. 
Bioequivalence: Relative bioequivalence of the various avatrombopag formulations used in the clinical 
pharmacology  development  program  was  overall  established.  As  studies  demonstrated  reduced 
variability,  the  2G  formulation  (rather  than  the  3G  formulation)  was  carried  forward  in  clinical 
development.  
Influence of food: It was demonstrated that while absorption was relatively unaffected by fasted or fed 
state, the variability of PK parameters was markedly reduced when avatrombopag was administered 
under fed conditions. It was further demonstrated that the type of food (high-fat or low-fat) did not affect 
neither rate nor extent of absorption. Both types of food reduced the PK variability. Based on these 
observations the SmPC recommends that avatrombopag should be administered with food.  
Distribution 
Avatrombopag displayed high plasma protein binding (96.3%-96.6%) in vitro. In vivo data from the 
14C-ADME study demonstrated that avatrombopag concentration in red blood cells was approximately 
half of that in plasma. The V/F determined from the popPK analyses was 180L. This is indicative of broad 
intracellular distribution.

Elimination 
The 14C-ADME study demonstrated that the primary route of excretion of avatrombopag is via feces 
(approx. 88% of the administered dose) while only 6% was excreted via urine. The major metabolite is 
4-OH-avatrombopag (accounting for approx. 43.8% of the administered dose). CYP2C9 (76.2% relative 
contribution) was the major responsible CYP isoform for the formation of 4-hydroxyl cis metabolite of 
avatrombopag while CYP3A4 (82.9% relative contribution) was the major responsible isoform for the 
formation of 4-hydroxyl trans metabolite. Two 2 other metabolites were also identified in feces. No active 
metabolites were detected. 
Metabolism 
The primary routes of metabolism of avatrombopag are via CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. CYP2C9 (76.2% relative 
contribution) forms the 4-hydroxyl cis metabolite of avatrombopag, while CYP3A4 (82.9% relative 
contribution) forms the 4-hydroxyl trans metabolite of avatrombopag. In total, 4-OH-avatrombopag in 
feces accounted for approx. 43.8% of the administered dose. An approx. 33.5% of the administered dose 
was recovered in feces as avatrombopag glucuronide. Further, in urine 3 [14C]avatrombopag related 
peaks were found but unidentified. In urine, approx. 6% of administered avatrombopag was recovered. 
In vivo interaction studies indicate that CYP2C9 is the primary enzyme involved in the metabolic clearance 
of avatrombopag while the contribution of CYP3A4 is minor. 
Genetic polymorphism: Too few patients with poor metabolizer status with regard to CYP2C9 were 
included in clinical studies to permit conclusions regarding this polymorphism. No impact of genotype with 
regard to CYP3A5 was demonstrated. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Avatrombopag displayed dose proportionality across the tested dose range although a plateau of AUC and 
Cmax appeared to be reached at the supratherapeutic dose of 100 mg.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/322871/2019 
Page 42/123 
 
 
 
 
Several studies have demonstrated both a high intra- and inter-individual variability when avatrombopag 
is  administered  in  the  fasted  state.  However,  when  administered  in  the  fed  state,  both  intra-  and 
inter-individual variability was markedly reduced (by approx. 50%). 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
All Phase 1/2 studies were conducted in healthy adults but data from the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies in 
CLD patients contributed data to the popPK analysis. In CLD patients, apparent plasma clearance, 
Assessment report

Page 43/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
apparent volume of distribution and Tmax were unchanged irrespective of recommended dose (40 mg or 
60 mg). AUC and Cmax displayed dose proportionality. 
Special populations 
Impaired renal function: Only 6% of orally administered avatrombopag was recovered in urine. Thus, 
renal impairment is unlikely to result in clinically relevant PK or PK/PD changes. Renal function studied by 
Pop PK modelling and covariate analysis showed no effect in subjects with eGFR ≥29.9. No dose 
adjustment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate renal insufficiency.  
Impaired hepatic function: The target population of avatrombopag consists of CLD patients. The 
popPK analysis found that subjects with CLD were a significant covariate with regard to apparent volume 
of distribution (V/F being approx. 65% higher in CLD subjects compared to healthy individuals) but not to 
apparent plasma clearance. The similar apparent plasma clearance means that total plasma exposure is 
similar between CLD patients and healthy subjects. The degree of hepatic impairment did not impact 
results in the majority of patients. No dose adjustment is recommended in patients irrespective of degree 
of hepatic impairment. 
Race: Different race had no clinically relevant impact on PK parameters. PopPK and PK/PD analyses 
confirmed these findings as did efficacy analyses of the Phase 3 studies. No posology adjustments are 
recommended based on race. 
Elderly, children, gender and body weight: The popPK analyses found that neither age or body 
weight nor gender influenced PK. This was further confirmed in a definitive population analysis. Body 
weight and CLD did have statistically significant impact on apparent volume of distribution. However, 
simulations showed that doubling of body weight had minimal impact on exposure and platelet count. The 
avatrombopag indication is only pursued in the adult population.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Avatrombopag as perpetrator: Avatrombopag did not inhibit any of the major liver CYP isoenzymes 
in-vitro but was shown to be a weak inducer of CYP3A4/5 and CYP2C9. In-vitro studies showed 
avatrombopag was a weak OATP1B1 and OCT2 inhibitor, and a moderate to potent OATP1B3, OAT1 and 
OAT3 inhibitor. 
Avatrombopag as prey: P-gp inhibitors do not affect avatrombopag PK and PD in a clinical relevant 
grade even though avatrombopag has been shown to be a substrate of P-gp. In healthy volunteers in a 
fasted state with the majority of subjects being extensive metabolizers of CYP2C9 and after a single 20 
mg dose of avatrombopag, no detrimental effect on PK or PD was observed that would warrant a change 
in posology. However, PBPK/PD simulations of steady-state conditions in CLD subjects at clinically 
relevant doses of avatrombopag showed more profound effects of enzyme induction and inhibition on 
platelet counts.

Effect of acid reducing agents: Avatrombopag is classified as a Class IV compound and practically 
insoluble in the pH range of 1 to 9. For this reason, evaluation of gastric effect solely by Pop PK covariate 
analysis is acceptable. The impact of acid reducing agents on avatrombopag PK studied by modelling and 
covariate analysis showed no effect. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Avatrombopag is an orally administered, small molecule (i.e. non-peptide) c-Mpl agonist that mimics the 
biologic effects of TPO, the physiologic regulator of platelet production, in vitro and in vivo. TPO exerts its 
effect on megakaryocytopoiesis and thrombocytopoiesis through binding and activation of the TPO 
receptor, which is expressed on haematopoietic stem cells, on cells of the megakaryocytic lineage, and on 
platelets. Avatrombopag activates human c-Mpl by binding to a different site on the TPO receptor than 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/322871/2019 
Page 45/123 
 
 
 
 
 
TPO, but it stimulates signal transduction and mimics the biologic effects of TPO, resulting in a predictable 
increase in platelet counts. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
The final PK/PD model for avatrombopag included exposure-platelet response (PK/PD) analyses for 
avatrombopag-treated subjects from Study 202, Study 204, Study 310 and Study 311. It included the 
effects of East Asian race (Japanese, Chinese, and Korean), plasma TPO, and albumin on the 
exposure-response slope parameter. PK/PD analysis detected a median 32% lower slope in East Asian 
subjects relative to the rest of the population, but overall change from Baseline in platelet counts during 
the window of scheduled procedure was not affected. The difference was not deemed clinically important. 
The effect of TPO on platelet count was assessed by simulating the final PK/PD model with increasing TPO 
levels ranging from 75, 100, and 125 ng/L, which are the most frequent TPO levels at Baseline in the 
PK/PD dataset from Study 202, Study 204, Study 310 and Study 311. 
Simulations were performed for non-East Asian CLD subjects with Baseline platelet count between 20 and 
40×109/L following dosing 60 mg avatrombopag QD for 5 days (left panel) and with Baseline platelet 
count between 40 and 50×109/L following dosing 40 mg avatrombopag QD for 5 days (right panel). The 
90% PIs of platelet count-time profiles following avatrombopag administration for each level of TPO and 
each dosing level showed comparable elevation in platelet count, and thus little impact of TPO on platelet 
count elevation. 
Secondary pharmacology 
A thorough QT study was conducted. No effect of avatrombpoag on the QTc interval was detected. 
Further, no cardiovascular effects of avatrombopag were detected in the clinical studies. A PK-QTcF 
interval analysis model could not integrate data adequately to support a credible model prediction. 
Irrespective of the lack of modelling of predicted effect on the QTc interval, clinical data demonstrate that 
avatrombopag has no effect on the QTc interval.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/322871/2019 
Page 46/123 
 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
The PK/PD model predicts comparable increases in the platelet count following avatrombopag 
administration irrespective of TPO level. This is considered supportive of the hypothesis generated during 
non-clinical development that avatrombopag may exert effect even in the event of high levels of 
endogenous TPO. Further, as similar platelet count increases are predicted irrespective of TPO level, the 
model supports that administration of avatrombopag even in the event of high levels of endogenous TPO 
has acceptable safety. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect and dose selection rationale 
An optimal dose regimen was achieved by Pop PK/PD modelling using the early Pop PK model with Phase 
2 data and the 2G tablet formulation. The dose-response relation was shown to be dependent of baseline 
platelet count. Two dosing regimens were chosen for the Phase 3 studies in CLD subjects: 40 mg QD for 
5 days with baseline platelet count from 40 to less than 50×109/L and 60 mg QD for 5 days with baseline 
platelet count less than 40×109/L. The clinical pharmacology data from patient studies support the 
proposed dose regimens. The rationale behind the clinical dose setting and dosing interval of 40 mg or 60 
mg QD avatrombopag for 5 days is justified. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics: Methodologically, the clinical studies were well conducted, and the pharmacokinetic 
models developed were in general considered acceptable with exception of the model to predict impact on 
QTc interval. The Pop PK analysis, Pop PK/PD analysis and PBPK models were adequately assessed and 
the model predictions were in general supported by in vivo data. Overall, bioequivalence was 
demonstrated between the various formulations used in the clinical development program. The 2G 
formulation was carried forward in clinical development and subsequently commercialised.  
Avatrombopag absorption is measurable in plasma 0.5-1 hour post-dosing with a Tmax of approx. 4-8 
hours. Bioavailability is an estimated minimum of 44%. In general, across the tested dose ranges, dose 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/322871/2019 
Page 47/123 
 
 
 
 
proportionality for Cmax and AUC was demonstrated although a plateau seemed to be reached at a 
(supratherapeutic) dose of 100 mg. Half-life vas an estimated 18-24 hours. Studies investigating the 
influence of food determined that variability of PK parameters was significantly reduced when avatrom-
bopag was administered with food (high fat or low fat). Plasma binding of avatrombopag is high and 
ranging from 96.3%-96.6%. The apparent volume of distribution was 180L and avatrombopag displays 
broad intracellular distribution. Avatrombopag is excreted primarily via faeces (approx. 88% of the 
administered dose being recovered in faeces) while only 6% of avatrombopag was recovered in urine. 
Avatrombopag undergoes oxidative metabolism primarily via CYP2C9 with CYP3A4 playing a minor role. 
Three identified metabolites are formed, one by glucuronidation (approx. 33.5%) and two by oxidation 
(approx. 43.8%). Further 3 unidentified peaks were detected in urine. Possible impact of genetic 
polymorphism has been investigated particularly with regard to CYP2C9 and CYP3A5. For CYP2C9, too few 
poor metabolizers were included in studies 018 and 019 to make conclusions regarding the impact of 
genotype on the extent of interaction. For CYP3A5, no impact of genotype on the extent of interaction was 
detected.   
All Phase 1/2 studies were conducted in healthy adults. Linear PK was established across the intended 
therapeutic dose range. In CLD patients in Phase 2 and 3 studies, apparent plasma clearance, apparent 
volume of distribution and Tmax were unchanged irrespective of recommended dose (40 mg or 60 mg). 
AUC and Cmax displayed dose proportionality. Thus, the PK in the target population is considered 
adequately investigated.  
Special populations: The possible impact of renal impairment, hepatic impairment, race, gender, body 
weight and age was investigated in dedicated studies, in popPK and PK/PD models and in efficacy 
analyses of the Phase 3 studies. A warning to observe for both adequate as well as higher than anticipated 
increase in platelet count for patients with Child-Pugh score Class C has been included in the SmPC. Only 
6% of orally administered avatrombopag was recovered in urine. Thus, renal impairment is unlikely to 
result in clinically relevant PK or PK/PD changes. PopPK analyses confirmed this. The target population of 
avatrombopag consists of CLD patients. The popPK analysis found that subjects with CLD were a 
significant covariate with regard to V/F (V/F being approx. 65% higher in CLD subjects compared to 
healthy individuals) but not to CL/F. The similar CL/F means that total plasma exposure is similar between 
CLD patients and healthy subjects. Three studies in Phase 1 investigated the impact of race (Chinese, 
Japanese, white). In study 006, following 10 mg and 40 mg single dose administrations, no PK differences 
between races were observed. Following 80 mg single dose (supra-therapeutic), mean exposure for 
Japanese subjects was lower as compared with Chinese and white subjects. Although 10 mg once daily 
multiple dose administration under fasting conditions yielded similar PK values across races, data 
indicated that the Chinese group had a lower AUC and platelet count than the Caucasian group at Day 7 
(steady-state). However, this does not warrant a change in posology for the East Asian population based 
on adequate responses to this issue by the Applicant. It is noted that the variability of Cmax and AUC was 
high (>70%) in study 006. Study 015 conducted only in Japanese subjects resulted in higher exposure 
across all tested doses as compared with study 006 but lacked a white cohort for comparison. Study 018 
compared white and Japanese subjects using the planned commercial tablets (2G) of the recommended 
doses (40 mg and 60 mg). Results showed no difference in plasma exposure (AUC) and PD parameters 
between Japanese and white subjects, however Cmax was 20% higher in the Japanese group. PopPK and 
PK/PD analyses confirmed the findings as did efficacy analyses of the Phase 3 studies. The popPK 
analyses also found that neither age nor gender influenced PK. Body weight and CLD did, however, have 
statistically significant impact on apparent volume of distribution. Simulations showed that doubling of 
body weight had minimal impact on exposure and platelet count. Guidance to the prescribing physician 
regarding proper monitoring of increase of platelet count has been introduced in the SmPC. The 
avatrombopag indication is only pursued in the adult population. Overall, it is considered justified that no 
posology adjustments are recommended for special populations.

Interactions: In vitro studies indicated that avatrombopag is a substrate of P-gp. Additionally, 
avatrombopag was not found to be a substrate of transporters such as BCRP, BSEP or MRP2. The possible 
impact of avatrombopag on transporters OATP1B3, OAT1 or OAT3 (as suggested in vitro) was not 
investigated in vivo. Two in vivo interaction studies in healthy subjects were conducted. Study 008 
investigated the effect of concomitant administration of strong P-gp inhibitors. A small difference in AUC 
between the two P-glycoprotein inhibitors was noted, however, data indicated that the impact was not 
considered clinical relevant. Study 019 investigated the effect of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 modulators. No 
detrimental effects on PK or PD of avatrombopag were observed. DDI effects were also simulated by the 
PBPK model in CLD patients and at clinically relevant doses. Concerning effects of CYP2C9 inhibition or 
induction, upper and lower margins of predicted platelet counts fell outside the presumed limits of safety 
and efficacy. Model data did not show an impact of acid reducing agents on avatrombopag PK. 
Avatrombopag is a Class IV compound and practically insoluble in the pH range of 1 to 9 but a substrate 
of P-gp. For this reason, evaluation of gastic effect solely by popPK is considered acceptable.  
Pharmacodynamics: The avatrombopag clinical pharmacology program in Phase 1 contributing PD data 
consisted of one single dose and one multiple dose PK study, three studies investigating the effect of 
intrinsic factors on PK and PD, and a thorough QT study. Further, PK data from the Phase 2 and 3 studies 
contributed PK data to the PK and PD models. The mechanism of action of avatrombopag being an 
activator of human c-Mpl by binding to a different site on the TPO receptor than TPO (as such, a TPO 
agonist) is adequately described. 
The thorough QT study demonstrated no cardiovascular effects of avatrombopag. This was supported by 
observations from the Phase 3 studies. Non-clinical studies indicate that avatrombopag and rhTPO have 
additive effects with regard to increasing the number of megakaryocytes. The PK/PD model integrating 
data from Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies assess the effect of increasing TPO levels during concomitant 
avatrombopag administration. The model predicts comparable increases in platelet count irrespective of 
TPO level. Thus, the hypothesis that efficacy of avatrombopag is maintained even in the event of high TPO 
levels is confirmed while acceptable safety is also maintained. No genetic differences in PD response were 
detected. PK studies 001 and 002 confirmed dose proportionality between avatrombopag and mean 
change in platelet count. The Pop PK/PD model predicted that the dose-response relation between 
avatrombopag and final platelet count was dependent of baseline platelet count. Based on this, two 
different dosing regimens determined by baseline platelet count were chosen for the Phase 3 studies. The 
rationale behind these regimens is adequately described and supported by clinical pharmacology data 
from patient studies. 
Overall, the clinical pharmacodynamics of avatrombopag are considered sufficiently described. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Methodologically, the clinical studies were overall well conducted, and the pharmacokinetic models 
developed were in general regarded acceptable. The PK of avatrombopag is considered adequately 
described. The in vivo interaction studies in healthy subjects are acceptable. Concerning effects of 
CYP2C9 inhibition or induction, upper and lower margins of predicted platelet counts fall outside the 
presumed limits of safety and efficacy, respectively. This, however, does not result in clinically relevant 
changes in PD.  
Overall, the clinical pharmacodynamics of avatrombopag are considered sufficiently described. The 
proposed clinical dosing regimen of 40 mg or 60 mg QD avatrombopag for 5 days, dependent of baseline 
platelet counts, is supported.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The overall avatrombopag clinical development program enrolled more than 1350 subjects, including 532 
healthy subjects and 824 patients in 24 sponsor-initiated clinical studies. Four clinical studies (n = 604) 
were specifically conducted in patients with Chronic Liver Disease (CLD) and thrombocytopenia who are 
scheduled to undergo an invasive procedure (the proposed indication). The four studies were all 
randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled trials. 
The efficacy data for avatrombopag in the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with Chronic Liver 
Disease (CLD) who are scheduled to undergo a procedure consists of 4 clinical studies (n=604). The 
studies include two global, pivotal phase 3 studies (Study 310 and Study 311, n=435 FAS) and 2 
multicentre, supportive phase 2 studies (Study 202 and Study 204, n= 169). All studies were 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies conducted in subjects with thrombocytopenia 
associated with CLD. 
A summary of key study design features for the studies providing evidence for the efficacy of 
avatrombopag for treatment of thrombocytopenia in subjects with CLD who are scheduled to undergo a 
procedure is presented in Table 2.7.3.-1 below for studies 310 and 311 (pivotal, phase 3) and studies 202 
and 204 (supportive, phase 2).

Study 202 
Study 202 evaluated the dosing, efficacy, and safety of once-daily oral avatrombopag dosing used up to 
7 days in subjects with thrombocytopenia and CLD prior to a scheduled procedure. Importantly, this study 
also evaluated 2 avatrombopag tablet formulations: 1G formulation (Cohort A), and 2G tablet formulation 
(Cohort B) that was developed to improve absorption and bioavailability; the 2G formulation was 
subsequently used in the Phase 2 Study 204 and both Phase 3 studies (Study 310 and Study 311), and is 
the planned commercial formulation of avatrombopag. Data from this study also supported the 
development of a population PK/PD model that characterized the relationship between avatrombopag 
plasma concentrations and platelet counts, and provided the data upon which the dosing regimens for the 
Phase 3 studies were based. 
A total of 130 subjects were enrolled in Study 202, and 71.5% received avatrombopag (51 in Cohort A 
and 42 in Cohort B), and 28.5% received placebo (16 in Cohort A and 21 in Cohort B). Subjects in Cohort 
A were randomized into 4 treatment groups and received avatrombopag (1G) with a loading dose (100 
mg, Day 1) followed by 1 of 3 doses of avatrombopag (20 mg, 40 mg or 80 mg) on Days 2 to Day 7, or 
matching placebo. Subjects in Cohort B were randomized and received avatrombopag (2G) with a loading 
dose (80 mg, Day 1) followed by 1 of 2 doses of avatrombopag (10 mg Days 2 to Day 7 or 20 mg Days 2 
to 4) or matching placebo. Study drug was administered without regard to food in this study, and the 
scheduled procedure was to be performed within 1 to 4 days after the last dose of study drug. In general, 
demographic and Baseline characteristics were comparable across treatment groups, with some 
variability in the smaller subgroups that did not affect the overall analyses. 
The primary efficacy endpoint for Study 202 was the proportion of Responders, defined as subjects having 
both an increase in platelet count of at least 20×109/L from Baseline, and a platelet count greater than 
50×10(9)/L at least once during the Day 4 through Day 8 period. For the primary efficacy endpoint 
analysis, all avatrombopag-treated subjects were pooled from Cohort A and Cohort B by dose and 
compared with the single pooled group of all placebo-treated subjects from the 2 cohorts. The Responder 
rate in the combined avatrombopag treatment group was higher (48.4%) compared to the combined 
placebo treatment group (8.1%) with a treatment difference (40.3%) that was highly significant 
(P<0.0001). Per the SAP, further testing compared the individual avatrombopag treatment arms with the 
placebo treatment arm in Cohort B. The Responder rate in Cohort B was shown to be significantly higher 
in subjects who received 20 mg avatrombopag (52.4%) compared with placebo-treated subjects (9.5%; 
P=0.0063), and also in the 10 mg avatrombopag treatment group (42.9%; P=0.0325).

Study 204 
Study 204 evaluated once-daily oral avatrombopag (2G) administered for up to 5 days in Japanese 
subjects with thrombocytopenia and CLD. Thirty nine subjects were enrolled in Study 204, and based on 
their Baseline platelet counts were assigned to: 1) the Low Platelet Count Cohort (<40×10(9)/L), 48.7%, 
and randomized to receive either avatrombopag (2G) (20 mg, 3 subjects; 40 mg, 3 subjects; or 60 mg, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/322871/2019 
Page 54/123 
 
 
 
 
 
10 subjects) or placebo (3 subjects) for 5 days; or to 2) the High Platelet Count Cohort (≥40.0 to <50.0
×10(9)/L), 51.3%, and randomized to receive either avatrombopag (2G) (20 mg, 4 subjects; or 40 mg, 
8 subjects) or placebo (8 subjects) for 5 days. Study drug was to be administered with meals in this study, 
and the scheduled procedure was to be performed within 5 to 8 days after the last dose of study drug. In 
general, there were no notable differences between the avatrombopag and placebo treatment groups 
with respect to the key demographic and Baseline characteristics. 
The primary efficacy endpoint for Study 204 was the Responder rate; a Responder in this study was 
defined as a subject with a platelet count greater than or equal to 50×109/L and a platelet count increase 
from Baseline of at least a 20×109/L at Visit 4 (Procedure Day, Day 10). Two analyses of the primary 
efficacy endpoint were performed: a combined efficacy analysis that pooled the treatment groups by dose 
across the 2 Baseline platelet count cohorts, resulting in a total of 4 treatment groups: 20 mg 
avatrombopag (7 subjects), 40 mg avatrombopag (11 subjects), 60 mg avatrombopag (10 subjects), and 
placebo (11 subjects); and a second efficacy analysis by the individual Baseline platelet count cohorts and 
their respective placebo treatment groups. 
In the combined efficacy analysis, the Responder rates on Procedure Day were higher in the 
avatrombopag treatment groups (20 mg, 28.6%; 40 mg, 63.6%; 60 mg, 40.0%) compared to the 
placebo treatment group (9.1%) with a statistically significant treatment difference in favour of 
avatrombopag in the 40 mg (P=0.004) and 60 mg (P=0.024) treatment groups. Similarly in the efficacy 
analysis by Baseline platelet count cohort, the Responder rates on Procedure Day were higher in the Low 
Platelet Count Cohort avatrombopag treatment groups (20 mg, 66.7%; 40 mg, 33.3%, and 60 mg, 40%) 
compared to no Responders (0.0%) in the placebo treatment group. In the High Platelet Count Cohort, 
there were no Responders in the 20 mg avatrombopag treatment group, but the Responder rate in the 40 
mg group avatrombopag treatment was higher (75.0%) compared to the placebo treatment group 
(12.5%). These analyses were limited by the small size of the individual treatment groups. 
The proportion of subjects with a platelet count greater than or equal to 50×109/L at Visit 4 (Procedure 
Day, Day 10), a secondary efficacy endpoint in Study 204, was also higher in all the combined 
avatrombopag treatment groups (20 mg, 71.4%; 40 mg, 81.8%, and 60 mg, 50.0%) compared to 
placebo-treated subjects (9.1%); the treatment difference was significant in the 20 mg (P=0.012) and 40 
mg (P=0.004) avatrombopag treatment groups, but not in the subjects who received 60 mg (P=0.063) of 
avatrombopag in this study.

Dosing for phase 3 trials 
The goal of avatrombopag dosing was to provide a predictable, transient increase in platelet counts from 
less than 50×109/L at Baseline to the targeted level ≥50×109/L by the day of the scheduled procedure. 
Importantly, the recommended dosing regimens were specifically designed to minimise the percentage of 
subjects who developed platelet counts greater than or equal to 200×109/L after treatment, which have 
been associated with a greater risk of developing thromboembolic events, e.g. portal vein thrombosis 
(PVT), in subjects receiving another TPO receptor agonist (eltrombopag) in the same target patient 
population (Eltrombopag Evaluated for its Ability to Overcome Thrombocytopenia and Enable Procedures 
[ELEVATE] study; Afdhal, et al., 2012). 
The two dosing regimens used in the 2 pivotal phase III studies (Study 310 and Study 311) were based 
on the subjects’ Baseline platelet count, and were selected based on PK/PD modelling of Phase II data. 
Subjects with a Baseline platelet count of less than 40×109/L were assigned to the Low Baseline Platelet 
Count Cohort and received 60 mg of avatrombopag once daily for 5 days, and subjects with a Baseline 
platelet count of 40 to less than 50×109/L were assigned to the High Baseline Platelet Count Cohort and 
received 40 mg of avatrombopag once daily for 5 days. Five to 8 days after the last dose of avatrombopag 
(on Study Day 10 to 13), each subject underwent a scheduled procedure. All subjects were instructed to 
take their study treatments with a meal.

Treatments 
For both studies, the test drug was avatrombopag (2G tablet formulation).  
The  study  drugs  included  both  avatrombopag,  expressed  as  the  amount  of  free  base,  and  matching 
placebo tablets. 
Subjects were instructed to take avatrombopag 20-mg tablets or matching placebo orally, once daily, 
with a meal, as follows: 
Low Baseline Platelet Count Cohort (<40×109/L): 
•  Avatrombopag: 60 mg avatrombopag (3×20-mg tablets) once daily on Days 1 through 5 
• 
Placebo: matching placebo tablets (3×20-mg) once daily on Days 1 through 5 
High Baseline Platelet Count Cohort (≥40×109/L to <50×109/L): 
•  Avatrombopag: 40 mg avatrombopag (2×20-mg tablets) once daily on Days 1 through 5 
Placebo: matching placebo tablets (2×20-mg) once daily on Days 1 through 5

The proportion of subjects who did not require a platelet transfusion or any rescue procedure for bleeding 
after randomization and up to 7 days following a scheduled procedure. 
Secondary efficacy Endpoints

Proportion  of  responders  defined  as  subjects  who  achieve  platelet  counts  of  ≥50  ×  109/L  on 
Procedure Day (i.e., prior to receiving a platelet transfusion or undergoing the elective procedure) 
Assessment report

•  Change  from  baseline  in  platelet  count  on  Procedure  Day  (i.e.,  prior  to  receiving  a  platelet 
transfusion or undergoing the elective procedure) 
Exploratory endpoints 
• 
• 
Platelet count and change from baseline in platelet count at each visit 
Proportion of responders defined as subjects who achieve platelet counts of ≥50 × 10(9)/L, ≥75 
× 10(9)/L, or ≥200 × 10(9)/L at each visit 
•  Number of platelet units used per platelet transfusion episode 
•  Severity  of  bleeding  event  assessed  by  WHO  bleeding  score  and  Bleeding Academic  Research 
Consortium (BARC) bleeding scale 
• 
Proportion  of  subjects  with  a  WHO  bleeding  score  ≥2  after  randomization  and  up  to  7  days 
following an elective procedure 
•  Health economics assessed by resource use 
Sample size 
For both pivotal studies, the sample size was based on the comparison of the primary efficacy variable. 
Based on clinical opinion and previous studies, the Sponsor assumed that the response rate in the placebo 
group would be 18 %. The effect on the treated group was estimated using the results from the Phase 2 
study (E5501-G000-202) and dose-response modelling. Within each baseline platelet count cohort, a 
sample size of 100 randomized subjects, 67 subjects for avatrombopag and 33 subjects for placebo, 
would have greater than 90% power to detect an absolute difference of 35% between the avatrombopag 
response rate and the placebo response rate using Fisher’s Exact tests with a 2-sided α=0.05. The sample 
size allowed for a 10% drop-out rate. 
Randomisation 
Eligible subjects were assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts according to their mean laseline platelet count, into either 
the low baseline platelet count cohort (<40×10(9)/L) or the high baseline platelet count cohort (≥40 to 
<50×10(9)/L). Within each Baseline platelet count cohort, subjects were further stratified by the risk of 
bleeding associated with their scheduled procedure (low, moderate, or high), and by the diagnosis of HCC 
status (yes, no). Neither of the baseline platelet cohorts was permitted to comprise greater than 55 % of 
the total number of subjects enrolled in the study. Regarding the proportion of risk bleeding procedures, 
it was planned that no fewer than 10% of subjects were enrolled into the high risk group and no more than 
60% of subjects in the low risk group. 
The randomization ratio was 2 (avatrombopag):1(placebo). 
Blinding (masking) 
During  the  Randomization  Phase,  subjects  and  all  personnel  involved  with  the  conduct  and  the 
interpretation of the study, including investigators, site personnel, and sponsor staff were blinded to the 
treatment  codes.  Randomization  data  were  kept  strictly  confidential,  filed  securely  by  an  appropriate 
group at the sponsor, and accessible only to authorized persons (eg, Eisai Global Safety) until the time of 
unblinding, per SOPs.

Statistical methods 
The two pivotal Phase 3 studies (Study 310 and Study 311) were identically-designed, global, 
multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies using avatrombopag to 
treat adults with thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 50×10(9)/L) associated with CLD. 
The studies were multicentre studies with approximately 100 participating sites. Due to the sample size, 
the results were pooled across centres. 
Definition of analysis dataset 
• 
• 
Full Analysis Set (FAS): All subjects randomized into the study. This is the population used in the 
primary efficacy analysis. 
Per Protocol Analysis Set: All randomized subjects who received protocol assigned study drug and 
do not have major protocol deviations. This population is used in a sensitivity analysis for the 
primary endpoint. 
•  Safety Analysis Set: All subjects who received at least a dose of study drug and have at least one 
post dose safety assessment. This population is used in the safety evaluations. 
Calculations for the primary endpoint 
The proportion of subjects without platelet transfusion or any rescue procedure for bleeding is analysed 
separately within each baseline platelet count cohort (<40 × 10(9)/L or from 40 to <50 × 10(9)/L) using 
the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test adjusting for the risk of bleeding associated with the elective 
procedure (low, moderate, or high). Since the HCC status was included in the randomization stratification 
for safety purposes only, not for efficacy consideration, HCC is not included in the CMH model for the 
primary efficacy analysis. 
The 95% CI for the proportion of subjects not requiring a platelet transfusion or any rescue procedure for 
bleeding is calculated for each treatment group within each baseline platelet count cohort. In addition, the 
95% CI for the difference between avatrombopag and matching placebo is also provided within each 
baseline platelet count cohort using normal approximation method. 
Missing values are considered as non-responders. 
Calculations for the secondary endpoints 
The first secondary endpoint (proportion of responders defined as subjects who achieve platelet counts of 
≥50 × 10(9)/L on Procedure Day) is analysed as the primary endpoint. Missing values are considered as 
non-responders. 
The change from baseline in platelet count on Procedure Day are analysed using the Wilcoxon rank sum 
test separately within each baseline platelet count cohort (<40 × 10(9)/L or from 40 to <50 × 10(9)/L), 
each at a significance level of α=0.05. The treatment difference between avatrombopag and placebo is 
provided within each baseline platelet count cohort using Hodges-Lehmann estimation along with 
associated asymptotic (Moses) 95% CIs. Last observation carried forward is used for subjects with 
missing platelet count on Procedure Day for this analysis. 
Multiplicity adjustment 
Both baseline cohorts need to show statistically significant positive results to conclude that the study is 
positive. Thus, both cohort are tested at 5 % significant level keeping the family-wise type I error at 5 %. 
A sequential gatekeeping testing procedure is used for the secondary efficacy endpoints to control the 
family-wise Type I error rate at a significance level of α=0.05. The secondary efficacy endpoints is

Page 60/123 
 
 
 
analyzed if the primary efficacy endpoint is statistically significant for both baseline platelet count cohorts. 
The first secondary efficacy endpoint is tested first within each baseline platelet count cohort, each at a 
significance level of α=0.05. Only if the first secondary efficacy endpoint is statistically significant for both 
baseline platelet count cohorts, the analysis of second secondary efficacy endpoint would proceed within 
each baseline platelet count cohort, each at a significance level of α=0.05. No alpha adjustment was 
planned for other efficacy endpoints. 
Sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint 
• 
PP analysis: The same primary efficacy analyses described is repeated based on the PP analysis 
set. 
•  Observed case: The same primary efficacy analyses is repeated based on observed data. Subjects 
with missing information about the primary efficacy outcome are excluded from this analysis. 
• 
Fisher’s exact Test: The same primary efficacy analyses is carried out using Fisher’s exact test. 
•  Modified primary efficacy endpoint: Proportion of subjects who do not require a platelet 
transfusion after randomization and up to 7 days following an elective procedure. This efficacy 
endpoint is analyzed using the same approach as primary efficacy analysis using FAS.

Protocol Deviatons 
Study 310: 
A combined total of 24.2% (56/231) of subjects had major protocol deviations, the majority of which were 
under the category of Study Procedures across all treatment groups.  
The most frequent deviations were due to: 1) subjects receiving platelet transfusion despite having a 
significant increase in platelet count, and 2) subjects who did not have a clinically significant increase in 
platelet count from Baseline to Procedure Day had, at the investigator’s discretion, the scheduled 
procedure without being given a preprocedural platelet transfusion.  
Overall, this included 5.4% (8/149) of subjects in the combined avatrombopag treatment group and no 
subjects in the combined placebo treatment group. 
Overall, the percentage of subjects with protocol deviations was lower in the combined avatrombopag 
groups (18.8% [28/149] subjects) compared to the combined placebo groups (34.1% [28/82] subjects). 
Both the Low and High Baseline Platelet Count Cohort had higher proportion of subjects with major 
protocol deviations in the placebo treatment group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/322871/2019 
Page 64/123 
 
 
 
 
 
The Low Baseline Platelet Count Cohort placebo treatment group had the highest proportion of subjects 
with major protocol deviations (39.6% [19/48] subjects). 
The most frequent deviation was due to subjects not having a scheduled procedure (14.6% [7/48] 
subjects each), while the remaining treatment groups had a similar proportion of subjects with major 
protocol deviations. 
Study 311: 
A combined total of 18.1% (37/204) of subjects had major protocol deviations, the majority of which were 
under the category of Study Procedures across all treatment groups.  
The most frequent deviation was that subjects who did not have a clinically significant increase in platelet 
count from Baseline to Procedure Day had, at the investigator’s discretion, the scheduled procedure 
without being given a preprocedural platelet transfusion.  
Overall, this included 1.6% (2/128) of subjects in the combined avatrombopag treatment group and 
6.6% (5/76) of subjects in the combined placebo treatment group. These subjects were removed from 
the PPAS analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint, although they had been assessed as Responders in the 
primary FAS efficacy analysis even though their platelet counts had not increased to ≥50×109/L on 
Procedure Day, since they had not received a transfusion or rescue procedure for bleeding. 
An additional 5 (2.5%) subjects received a platelet transfusion, despite having a significant increase in 
platelet count. Overall, this included 2.3% (3/128) of subjects in the combined avatrombopag treatment 
group and 2.6% (2/76) of subjects in the combined placebo group. These transfusions were performed 
immediately preceding the scheduled dental procedures. In all cases the dentist performing the 
procedure (not the PI), considered the platelet count insufficiently high for a dental procedure, due to 
their assessment of a high risk of bleeding. 
Overall, the percentage of subjects with protocol deviations was lower in the combined avatrombopag 
treatment group (14.8% [19/128] subjects) compared to the combined placebo treatment group (23.7% 
[18/76] subjects). The Low Baseline Platelet Count Cohort placebo treatment group had the highest 
proportion of subjects with major protocol deviations (27.9% [12/43] subjects), consisting mostly of 
subjects who did not receive a platelet transfusion before a scheduled procedure (9.3% [4/43] subjects), 
even though they did not have a significant increase in platelet count from Baseline to Procedure, while 
the remaining treatment groups had a similar proportion of subjects with major protocol deviations.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint: 
The primary efficacy endpoint in both pivotal Phase 3 studies was the proportion of subjects who did not 
require a platelet transfusion or any rescue procedure for bleeding after randomization and up to 7 days 
following a scheduled procedure. Responders were defined as subjects who did not require a platelet 
transfusion or rescue procedure for bleeding. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/322871/2019 
Page 71/123 
 
 
 
 
 
The consistency of the primary efficacy endpoint results from these 2 pivotal studies individually and from 
the integrated efficacy analyses is demonstrated for both the Low Baseline Platelet Count Cohort 
(<40×109/L) (Table 2.7.3-16 and Figure 2.7.3-11) and the High Baseline Platelet Count Cohort (≥40 
to <50×109/L) (Table 2.7.3-17, Figure 2.7.3-11), which further supports the positive treatment effect of 
avatrombopag in the target indication.

a:    Responders  were  defined  as  the  subjects  who  achieved  platelet  count  greater  than  or  equal  to 
50×109/L on the Procedure Day. 
b:  Subjects with missing platelet count on the Procedure Day were considered as not achieving platelet 
count 50×109/L in the analysis. 
c:  Two-sided 95% CI based on normal approximation. 
d:  Difference of proportion vs placebo = proportion of Responders for avatrombopag — proportion of 
Responders for placebo; 95% CI is calculated on normal approximation. 
e:  P value is based on CMH test stratified by the risk of bleeding associated with the scheduled procedure 
within each Baseline platelet count cohort. 
f:  P value is based on CMH test stratified by study.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The results of the subgroup analyses for the primary endpoint are presented in separate Forest plots for 
the Low Baseline Platelet Count Cohort (Figure 19) and the High Baseline Platelet Count Cohort 
(Figure 20) using the pooled Study 310 and Study 311 FAS. In addition, because of the relatively small 
size of some of the subgroups that limited conclusions, a subgroup analysis was also conducted using the 
pooled data across both Baseline platelet count cohorts from the 2 Phase 3 studies (Figure 21).

The target group is patients with CLD. Renal impairment is not considered to be of clinical relevance in 
regulation of thrombocytopoiesis in man, and a clinical study with avatrombopag in uremic patients is not 
necessary (Linthorst, 2002), nor performed.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Avatrombopag is a new, oral TPO-receptor agonist (TPO-RA), developed for the use in patients with 
chronic liver disease (CLD) before a scheduled, invasive procedure, which may cause bleeding. 
Thrombocytopenia and other disturbances in the coagulation system are frequently observed in this 
patient population. Thrombocytopenia < 50 in CLD is due to the insufficient TPO production, signalling to 
and stimulation of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. The incidence of thrombocytopenia <50 x 
10(9)/L, which is a cut-off value considered in most diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, is related to 
the extent of liver disease. SOC to prevent bleeding in planned procedures involves in particular the use

Page 92/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of platelet transfusions, which may be ineffective, cause complications and is dependent on blood donor 
activity. 
The two dosing regimens used in the pivotal phase III studies (Study 310 and Study 311) were based on 
the  subjects’  Baseline  platelet  count,  and  were  selected  based  on  PK/PD  modeling  of  phase  II  data. 
Subjects with a Baseline platelet count of less than 40×109/L were assigned to the Low Baseline Platelet 
Count Cohort and received 60 mg of avatrombopag once daily for 5 days, and subjects with a Baseline 
platelet count of 40 to less than 50×109/L were assigned to the High Baseline Platelet Count Cohort and 
received 40 mg of avatrombopag once daily for 5 days. Five to 8 days after the last dose of avatrombopag 
(on Study Day 10 to 13), each subject underwent a scheduled procedure. 
The  two  pivotal  studies  (trial  310  and  311)  were  identical  in  design  as  randomized,  double-blind, 
placebo-controlled,  global,  parallel-group  studies  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  once-daily 
avatrombopag for the treatment of adults with thrombocytopenia associated with liver disease prior to an 
elective procedure. Study 310 included 231 patients, study 311 included 204 patients. Because dosing is 
related to baseline platelet count, and patients with moderate thrombocytopenia have not been treated, 
which is evident from the results of screen-failures, the cut-off value reflects the investigated population. 
The  Applicant  presented  more  safety  information  and  rationale  to  aim  for  a  broad  indication,  not 
restricting  treatment  with  avatrombopag  to  specific  subgroups  of  patients  with  CLD  .  The  wording  of 
Section 4.1 was amended to “treatment of severe thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic liver disease 
undergoing  a  scheduled  invasive  procedure.”  Additionally,  the  exclusion  criterion  #3  on  portal  vein 
velocity should be used as a recommended screening tool to prevent portal thrombosis. The exclusion of 
9.3% of patients by this parameter is reflected as an identified important risk in the RMP. 
The in- and exclusion criteria pose some problems to handle, because a (minor) group of patients with 
CLD and a history of concomitant hepatic vascular affection and a (very large) group of patients with a 
previous history of any vascular manifestation, not related to present CLD, have not been included in the 
protocols.  It  is  rational  that  the  risk  for  thrombosis  is  increased  in  patients  with  present  partial  or 
complete  occlusion  in  the  hepatic  circulation,  and  that  any  thrombosis-prophylaxis  must  be  stopped. 
However,  a  patient  treated  for  a  vascular  event  years  before,  without  hepatic  involvement  and  now 
thrombocytopenic may not be treated. The safety issue is highly prioritised for avatrombopag treatment. 
The treatment in a RCT with a new TPO-agonist may probably cause thrombotic events in some patients, 
unless measures to mitigate this risk were preplanned. From the screen-failure registration it is evident 
that  only  2.1%  met  exclusion  criteria  1  (any  history  of  arterial  or  venous  thrombosis,  including  both 
partial or complete) and 5.3% met exclusion criteria 2 (evidence of thrombosis, partial or complete) in the 
main portal vein branches etc). The last circumstance justifies the precaution to perform a Doppler scan 
of  the  portal  vein  flow  (not  to  be  less  than  10  cm/sec),  the  first  precaution  was  due  to  the  – 
understandable – aim to provide a true assessment of the thromboembolic potential of the IMP, and not 
to confound it with other contributing factors.  
Patients were stratified according to the anticipated bleeding risk of the procedure and the platelet count, 
reflecting an overall assessment of the clinical risk. Patients were included only with a MELD score ≤24, 
which restricts patients classified by this score, but still allowed patients by any Child-Pugh class to be 
included, because the two classifications are based on different parameters. The rationale to use MELD 
and not Child-Pugh classification in the inclusion is accepted due to the prognostic impact by higher MELD 
scores in the setting of a RCT. The available efficacy and safety data demonstrated the consistency of the 
avatrombopag treatment effect with varying degrees of hepatic impairment, and support the proposed 
inclusion  of  patients  with  MELD  scores  >24  into  the  label.  However  as  requested,  the  applicant  has 
included patients with MELD scores >24 as missing information in the RMP. 
Patient randomization and flow of patients is satisfactory, and 91-97% of patients (presented according 
to base-line platelet count) completed the study.

The primary endpoint was defined as the proportion of subjects who did not require a platelet transfusion 
or  any  rescue  procedure  for  bleeding  after  randomization  and  up  to  7  days  following  a  scheduled 
procedure.  This  outcome  measure  is  considered  clinically  relevant,  as  it  does  not  focus  on  laboratory 
values but on the avoidance of platelet transfusions and the clinically evident need for the treatment of a 
bleeding event. 
Protocol deviations occurred in both studies, registered as 24.2% (310) and 18.1% (311) being major 
protocol deviations and raise a concern. Most frequently deviations were due to subjects receiving platelet 
transfusion  despite  having  a  significant  increase  in  platelet  count,  and  subjects  who  did  not  have  a 
clinically significant increase in platelet count from baseline to procedure day having, at the investigator’s 
discretion, the scheduled procedure without a pre-procedural platelet transfusion.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The primary efficacy endpoint in both pivotal phase 3 studies is a way to translate the effect of an increase 
in platelet production (and count) to the benefit for the patient in reducing transfusion need and risk of 
bleeding.  Responders  were  defined  as  subjects  who  did  not  require  a  platelet  transfusion  or  rescue 
procedure for bleeding. Bleeding risk related to procedures was defined. The increase in platelet count 
was  the  first  secondary  endpoint,  and  the  term  responder  defined  if  the  patient  achieved  the  target 
platelet count of greater than or equal to 50×10(9)/L on procedure Day (Day 10 to Day 13).  
Primary efficacy analyses using the FAS from each of the individual Phase 3 studies, and reproducible 
between the 310 and 311, as well as the pooled FAS, demonstrated a greater proportion of responders in 
the avatrombopag groups than in the respective placebo treatment groups in both baseline platelet count 
cohorts.  In  the  pooled  FAS,  the  proportion  of  responders  in  the  low  baseline  platelet  count  cohort 
(<40×10(9)/L)  was  higher,  66.9%  (107/160  subjects)  in  the  60  mg  avatrombopag  treatment  group 
compared  to  28.6%  (26/91  subjects)  in  the  placebo  treatment  group.  The  results  demonstrate  that 
38.3%  (95%  CI  [26.5,  50.1])  more  patients  responded.  Similarly  in  the  high  baseline  platelet  count 
cohort  (≥40  to  <50×10(9)/L),  the  proportion  of  subjects  not  requiring  a  platelet  transfusion  or  any 
rescue procedure for bleeding was 88.0% (103/117 subjects), for the 40 mg avatrombopag treatment 
group compared to 35.8% (24/67 subjects) in the placebo treatment group. The treatment difference in 
the proportion of responders was 52.2% (95% CI [39.3, 65.1]). The effect is highly statistical significant 
and  clinical  meaningful.  It  is  acceptable  that  a  relatively  high  proportion  of  placebo  patients  may  be 
assessed  as  responders,  and  more  in  the  high  baseline  platelet  group,  because  it  reflects  the  study 
design,  fluctuations  in  platelet  counts  and  the  circumstances  in  the  context  of  a  bleeding  risk-related 
procedure.  The  assessment  by  the  treating  specialist  should  be  in  accordance  with  study  synopsis. 
Therefore, it was important that the pivotal trials (as well as the two supportive) were blinded. The effect 
demonstrated by the primary endpoint was supported by results presented in secondary endpoints.  
Although Forest plot analysis demonstrate a beneficial effect across age, sex, ethnicity, platelet count, 
bleeding  risk,  cause  of  chronic  liver  disease,  and  MELD  score,  the  subgroup  analysis  also  disclosed  a 
vulnerable group of CLD patients. Forest plot analysis indicates that patients in Child-Pugh class C, with 
a platelet count <40 and scheduled for a procedure, did not have any effect of avatrombopag treatment 
by 60 mg QD in five days, nor did the patients achieve an increase in platelets on procedure day >50. It 
is accepted, however that the subgroup analysis demonstrates efficacy across Child-Pugh classes and 
MELD scores, including a positive Forest plot in the Child-Pugh Class C overall and that patients numbers 
are  small  which  hampers  the  reliability  of  the  analysis.  Taken  together  with  the  safety  report 
documentation,  and  the  medical  need  in  particular  in  this  subgroup  of  CLD  patients  with  severe 
thrombocytopenia,  the  indication  is  not  restricted  to  a  sub-class  of  patients.  Furthermore,  the  target 
patient population is expected to undergo multiple invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures during 
their  course  of  illness.  In  the  submitted  dossier,  while  there  are  comprehensive  data  illustrating  the 
Assessment report

efficacy of a single cycle of treatment with avatrombopag, there are no data supporting the efficacy of 
Doptelet after repeated administration. The applicant has later captured some patients, who (in the USA) 
have been treated repeatedly by five day courses. So far, there was no evidence of decreased efficacy 
over time and no new safety signals were identified. The fact that there are no data on retreatment with 
avatrombopag  within  the  desired  indication  in  a  clinical  trial  setting  has  been  reflected  in  the  SmPC, 
section 4.4.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
Efficacy of avatrombopag is considered demonstrated based on the results of the primary and secondary 
endpoints. The five-day oral treatment with avatrombopag is a beneficial therapeutic option in the target 
population of patients with platelet counts below 50 x109/L (severe thrombocytopenia) caused by chronic 
liver disease prior to a scheduled invasive procedure. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
2.6.1.  Clinical safety 
The  Primary  Safety  Data  (n  =  430)  include  in  Group  1  data  from  2  identically  designed,  global, 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled- pivotal Phase 3 studies (310, n = 231 and 311, n = 204). 
These studies used the planned commercial avatrombopag formulation (2nd generation [2G] tablets) at 
the target dose (40 mg or 60 mg), with the route (oral) and dosing regimen (daily for 5 days) in patients 
with thrombocytopenia and CLD, scheduled to undergo a procedure).  
The Supportive Safety Data include the pooled safety data from all 24 sponsor-initiated clinical Phase 1, 
Phase  2  and  Phase  3  studies  in  various  populations,  indications,  formulations,  doses,  and  dosing 
regimens. Group 2 (Thrombocytopenia in All CLD Studies), Group 3 (Thrombocytopenia in All Chronic 
Liver Disease Studies Including Hepatitis C Study), Group 4 (Thrombocytopenia in All Chronic immune 
[idiopathic]  thrombocytopenic  purpura  [ITP]  Studies),  Group  5  (Overall  Thrombocytopenia  in  All 
Indications Studies), and the Phase 1 studies summarized in Group 6 (Healthy Normal Subject).

Patient exposure 
The avatrombopag clinical development includes over 1350 subjects randomized and 1100 subjects exposed in 24 sponsor-initiated studies in healthy persons 
and patients. Four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies were conducted in patients with CLD and thrombocytopenia (n=604), 2 Phase 
3 studies (Study 310, n=231; Study 311, n=204) and 2 Phase 2 studies (Study 202, n=130; Study 204, n=39 Japanese patients).

Adverse events 
Data for all Groups are included in the dossier. Here, tabulated results from the two pivotal studies (Group 
1), which included data from n=430 CLD patients randomized 2:1 with thrombocytopenia to 
avatrombopag or placebo. The safety data in Groups 2 – 5 support the results presented.  
Bleeding after the procedure is dependent on coagulation status and the procedure, and more 
parameters, e.g. the skill of the treating physician.  
Table 2.7.4-10 shows bleeding by scheduled procedure according to a risk definition and presented in the 
two baseline platelet count cohort. 
Group 1 
The applicant presents overall incidences of adverse events for the primary safety analysis set that 
comprises of data from two identically-designed, placebo-controlled pivotal phase III studies in subjects 
with thrombocytopenia and CLD undergoing a procedure. In the pooled analysis, 148 (54.0%) of 274 
patients in the combined avatrombopag group and 86 (55.1%) of 156 patients in the combined placebo 
group had one or more adverse events.

The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) in at least 5% of subjects in the 
pooled avatrombopag or placebo treatment group were pyrexia (9.9% in the avatrombopag group versus 
9.0% in the placebo group), abdominal pain (6.6% versus 6.4%), nausea (6.6% versus 7.1%) and 
headache (5.5% versus 6.4%). No adverse events occurring in ≥ 3% of subjects had a ≥ 2% higher 
incidence in the avatrombopag group than in the placebo group. Most of the adverse events were of mild 
severity and considered unrelated to avatrombopag. CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs were reported in 28 
(10.2%) of 274 patients in the combined avatrombopag treatment group and in 15 (9.6%) of 156 
patients in the combined placebo group. The majority of individual Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs in Group 1 were 
reported in only 1 subject each. Adverse events considered treatment-related were reported for 26 (9.5%) 
patients in the avatrombopag group and 20 (12.8%) patients in the placebo group. The most frequently 
reported treatment-related AEs in the combined avatrombopag group were headache (1.8% in the 
avatrombopag group versus 4.5% in the placebo group), nausea (1.8% versus 1.9%), fatigue (1.5% 
versus 1.3%), dizziness (1.1% versus 1.3%), bone pain (0.7% versus 0%), diarrhoea (0.7% versus 
1.9%), and pyrexia (0.7% versus 0.6%).  
In general, the reported TEAEs are considered to be consistent with the underlying medical condition of 
the study population and the invasive procedures. In the pooled analysis, the incidence of TEAEs is 
deemed comparable between the avatrombopag and placebo group in both the low baseline platelet

count cohort and high baseline platelet count cohort. However, the incidence of Grade 3-5 TEAEs in study 
310 was inconsistent between the treatment groups in the two baseline platelet count cohorts. While the 
incidence of Grade 3-5 TEAEs was lower in the avatrombopag 60 mg group compared to placebo (7.9% 
avatrombopag 60 mg versus 16.7% placebo), a higher incidence has been observed in the avatrombopag 
40 mg group compared to the placebo group (17.2% in the avatrombopag 40 mg group compared to none 
in placebo). The Applicant has provided a discussion concerning the inconsistency of the incidence of 
Grade 3-5 TEAEs between the treatment groups of the two baseline platelet count cohorts of study 310. 
While the incidence of Grade 3-5 TEAEs was lower in the avatrombopag 60 mg group compared to 
placebo, a higher incidence has been observed in the avatrombopag 40 mg group compared to placebo. 
However, none of the reported Grade 3-5 TEAEs in the 40 mg avatrombopag group occurred in more than 
one subject. The only Grade 3-5 TEAE reported in 2 subjects was abdominal pain upper in the 60 mg 
avatrombopag treatment group. The applicant clarified that the demographic and baseline characteristics 
were comparable between the baseline platelet count cohorts and thus would not explain the observed 
differences between the treatment groups. Additionally, in the identically designed phase 3 study 311, the 
incidence of Grade 3-5 TEAEs was comparable between the treatment groups of both baseline platelet 
count cohorts. Although the provided discussion does not satisfactorily explain the reported higher 
incidence of Grade 3-5 TEAEs in the 40 mg avatrombopag group compared to placebo, it did not raise any 
new safety concerns.  
The Grade 3-4 TEAE of neutrophil count decrease was reported as occurring more frequently in the 
combined avatrombopag group compared to placebo (1.5% [4/274 subjects] in the avatrombopag versus 
0% in the placebo group). The Applicant submitted brief narrative descriptions including a timeline 
overview of the neutrophil count for each of the four subjects who experienced the Grade 3 or 4 TEAE of 
neutrophil count decrease.Review of the individual case reports revealed that in each of these patients a 
low neutrophil count was noted prior to the initiation of avatrombopag administration either at the time of 
the screening visit (day -11) or at baseline (day 1). The neutrophil count did not worsen on avatrombopag 
treatment and remained low or slightly increased throughout the study. The temporal relationship of this 
TEAE do not support a causal relationship between the adverse event of decreased neutrophil count and 
treatment with avatrombopag.  
The applicant evaluated fatigue, portal vein thrombosis, bone pain and pyrexia to be stated in the 
tabulated list of adverse events in section 4.8 of the SmPC. Inclusion of these adverse events was justified 
by the argument that they were reported in 2 or more subjects and occurred more frequently in the 
avatrombopag group compared to placebo. However, although anaemia and myalgia were judged as 
being related to study treatment and occurred more frequently in the avatrombopag arm compared to 
placebo, they were not included in the tabulated list of adverse events due to the fact that they were only 
reported in a single avatrombopag-treated subject. The applicant argued that only 1/10 of the anaemias 
and 1/2 of the myalgias were assessed as treatment-related and thus a causal relationship is not 
suspected. However, anaemia and myalgia have been reported as frequently occurring treatment-related 
AEs in patients treated with other approved TPO receptor agonists like eltrombopag and romiplostin. 
Additionally, according to the SmPC guideline, all adverse events at least possibly related to the 
investigational drug, based for example on their comparative incidence in clinical trials, should be 
included in the tabulated list of section 4.8. Low frequency of an adverse reaction is not a justification for 
deletion. Thus, anaemia and myalgia have been included in section 4.8.  
Group 2 
The applicant presents overall incidences of adverse events for the Group 2 safety analysis set consisting 
of data from the two phase III trials (pooled in Group 1) and two phase II trials in subjects with 
thrombocytopenia and CLD undergoing a procedure. 241 (61.0%) of 395 patients in the combined 
avatrombopag group and 122 (59.8%) of 204 patients in the combined placebo group had one or more

adverse events. The most frequently reported adverse events in the total avatrombopag or placebo 
treatment groups were nausea (7.8% in the avatrombopag group versus 7.8% in the placebo group), 
pyrexia (7.6% versus 9.3%), headache (6.3% versus 7.4%), and abdominal pain (5.6% versus 6.9%). 
The subject incidence of adverse events considered by an investigator to be potentially treatment- related 
was 14.4% in the combined avatrombopag group and 15.2% in the placebo group. The most frequently 
reported treatment-related AEs in the combined avatrombopag and placebo group were nausea (2.8% in 
the avatrombopag group versus 2.9% in the placebo group), headache (2.5% versus 5.4%), fatigue 
(2.3% versus 1.0%), and dizziness (1.5% versus 2.0%). The reported AEs in the pooled analysis of group 
2 reveal a similar pattern to that reported in group 1 and indicates a high background incidence of AEs 
caused by the underlying disease and the type of invasive procedures. 
Group 3 
The Group 3 safety analysis set includes four clinical studies in patients with thrombocytopenia and CLD 
(Group 2) and one study in subjects with thrombocytopenia and hepatitis C receiving antiviral therapy. 
Because of the different safety profile expected for subjects with thrombocytopenia and hepatitis C 
receiving antiviral therapy (study 203), compared to those subjects with thrombocytopenia and CLD 
enrolled in Group 2, the safety results from Study 203 were not pooled.  
During the A1 Period (21 days of study treatment and prior to treatment with antivirals) of study 203, 21 
(43.8%) of 48 subjects in the avatrombopag treatment group and 5 (29.4%) of 17 subjects in the placebo 
treatment group experienced TEAEs. In the Core Study and OLE Phase, 87.5% of all 
avatrombopag-treated subjects had a TEAE. The most frequently reported TEAE in the A1 Period in the 
avatrombopag treatment group was nausea (12.5% in avatrombopag versus 0% in placebo). The most 
frequently reported TEAEs in the avatrombopag treatment group across the Core and OLE Phases were 
anaemia (32.8%), neutropenia (32.8%), and nausea (31.3%). During the A1 Period, treatment-related 
TEAEs were reported for 29.2% (14/48) subjects in the avatrombopag treatment group and 17.6% 
(3/17) subjects in the placebo treatment group. The most frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs 
were nausea and fatigue in the avatrombopag treatment group, reported by 8.3% (4/48) subjects and 
6.3% (3/48) subjects, respectively. In the Core Study, the most frequently reported treatment-related 
TEAE in the avatrombopag treatment group was nausea (12.5%), and was reported in a higher 
percentage of subjects compared to the placebo treatment group (no subjects). The next most frequent 
treatment-related TEAEs in the Core study reported in the avatrombopag treatment group were 
diarrhoea, fatigue, and pruritus (6.3% [3/48] subjects, each), none of which were reported in the placebo 
treatment group. In the combined Core Study and OLE Phase, the incidence rate for treatment-related 
TEAEs was 50.0% (32/34) subjects. The most frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs were nausea 
(17.2%), fatigue (9.4%), chills, headache, and pruritus (7.8%). 
In the Core study, treatment-related AEs like nausea (12.5 avatrombopag versus 0% placebo), diarrhea, 
fatigue and pruritus (6.3% avatrombopag versus 0% placebo each) were reported more frequently in 
avatrombopag-treated subjects compared to placebo. Despite the fact that avatrombopag exposure was 
longer compared to the intended short-term use of 5 days, the applicant has discussed the reasons for the 
higher incidence of AEs in HCV patients who received avatrombopag in combination with antiviral agents 
compared to placebo. It is accepted that antiviral treatment itself is commonly associated with numerous 
adverse reactions including amongst others the more frequently reported AEs nausea, diarrhea, fatigue 
and pruritus. It is agreed with the Applicant that the observed higher incidence of these AEs in 
avatrombopag-treated patients after antiviral treatment compared to the incidence before antiviral 
treatment suggests that they were likely related to the antiviral therapy. However, it should be noted that 
thrombocytopenia has been reported as a commonly occurring adverse event after interferon treatment 
and thus should be considered when co-administrating avatrombopag with interferon products.

Furthermore, chronic HCV patients with severe hepatic impairment may be at risk of hepatic 
decompensation when receiving avatrombopag in combination with antiviral therapy (e.g. interferon). 
Due to the fact that only patients with a MELD score ranged from 8.2 to 9.7 have been included in this 
study, an increased risk of hepatic decompensation in these patients cannot be ruled out. However, the 
potential increased risk in those patients is mitigated by the short-term use of avatrombopag and the very 
limit current use of interferon with the advent of curative treatments for chronic hepatitis C. Additionally, 
the use of avatrombopag in patients receiving interferon products has been included as missing 
information in the RMP. 
Group 4 
The applicant presents overall incidences of adverse events for the Group 4 safety analysis set consisting 
of data from two phase II and two phase III studies in patients suffering from ITP. In the pooled analysis, 
97.7% of subjects in the avatrombopag group, 100% of subjects in the eltrombopag group and 63.6% of 
subjects in the placebo group had one or more adverse events. The most common TEAEs were the same 
for the avatrombopag and eltrombopag treatment groups with a lower incidence with placebo: headache 
(30.5%, 27.3%, and 13.6%, respectively) and fatigue (28.1%, 45.5%, and 9.1%, respectively). The 
majority of TEAEs in the avatrombopag and eltrombopag treatment groups and all TEAEs in the placebo 
treatment group were of mild severity. The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs was higher in the 
avatrombopag treatment group compared to the eltrombopag treatment group (35.2% avatrombopag 
versus 27.3% eltrombopag).The subject incidence of adverse events considered by an investigator to be 
potentially treatment-related was 66.4% in the combined avatrombopag group, 72.7% in the 
eltrombopag group and 18.2% in the placebo group. The most frequently reported treatment-related AEs 
were headache (20.3% avatrombopag, 9.1% eltrombopag and 9.1% placebo, respectively), fatigue 
(12.5%, 18.2%, and 9.1%, respectively), dizziness (7.0%, 18.2%, and 4.5%, respectively) and diarrhea 
(5.5%, 18.2%, and 0%, respectively). The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related TEAEs was mainly 
reported in the avatrombopag treatment group (17.2%) compared to the eltrombopag (9.1%), and 
placebo (0%) treatment groups. No differential pattern of AEs between avatrombopag and eltrombopag 
could be identified. Although, the incidence of TEAEs in the long-term studies was higher in the 
avatrombopag treatment group compared to the placebo group, no safety concerns evoked from the 
studies in ITP patients for the intended short-term use of avatrombopag in patients with 
thrombocytopenia and CLD.  
Group 5 
The safety analysis set of Group 5 consists of all clinical studies conducted in patients with 
thrombocytopenia (pooled analysis of Group 1 to 4). The incidence of TEAEs in Group 5 was greater in the 
total avatrombopag treatment group (71.9% [422/587] subjects) than in the total placebo treatment 
group (58.4% [142/243] subjects). The most common TEAEs were headache (12.9% avatrombopag 
versus 7.8% placebo), fatigue (12.1% versus 4.9%) and nausea (10.7% versus 6.6%). No other TEAEs 
were reported in at least 10% of subjects in the total treatment groups. The TEAEs with the highest 
incidence in the eltrombopag treatment group were fatigue (45.5%), and headache, diarrhoea, and 
nasopharyngitis (27.3% each). While the incidences of individual TEAEs in the avatrombopag and placebo 
treatment groups were generally low and similar in the short-term studies, the incidence of TEAEs in the 
long-term studies was generally higher in the avatrombopag treatment group compared to the placebo 
treatment group. 21.6% of subjects in the total avatrombopag group, 8.2% of subjects in the placebo 
group and 27.3% subjects in the eltrombopag group had TEAEs of CTCAE Grade 3 or 4. The most common 
Grade 3 to 4 TEAE in the avatrombopag group were neutropenia (3.2%), thrombocytopenia (2.7%), and 
leukopenia (2.4%). Treatment-related TEAEs were reported in 72.7% of subjects in the eltrombopag 
treatment group 29.6% of subjects in the avatrombopag treatment group and 15.6% of subjects in the 
placebo group. The most frequently reported treatment-related TEAE overall, was headache, reported in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/322871/2019 
Page 102/123 
 
 
  
 
7.0% of subjects in the total avatrombopag treatment group and 5.8% of subjects in the total placebo 
treatment group. No new safety concerns arise from the pooled safety analysis set of Group 5 consisting 
of all clinical trials in patients with thrombocytopenia (Group 1-4).  
Group 6 
The applicant presents overall incidences of adverse events for the Group 6 safety analysis set that 
consists of all phase I studies of the clinical development program. In single-dose studies, 406 (31.0%) 
of 1309 patients in the combined avatrombopag group and 24 (25.5%) of 94 patients in the combined 
placebo group had one or more adverse events. In multiple-dose studies, 20 (44.4%) of 45 subjects in 
the avatrombopag group and 9 (47.4%) of 19 subjects in the placebo group experienced one or adverse 
events. All reported TEAEs in the avatrombopag treatment group were of mild and moderate severity. In 
the single-dose studies, the most frequently reported treatment-related AEs in the avatrombopag or 
placebo treatment group was headache (3.8% in the avatrombopag group versus 9.6% in placebo). In 
the multiple-dose studies, the most frequently reported treatment-related AE in the avatrombopag 
treatment group was constipation (6.7% in the avatrombopag group versus none in placebo). No safety 
concerns evoked from the submitted single- or multiple-dose phase 1 studies 
Adverse events of special interest 
Group 1 
In the primary safety analysis set, adverse events of special interest included bleeding events, 
thromboembolic events and recurrence of thrombocytopenia. The proposed AESIs are endorsed. 
Hepatotoxicity has been reported as known side effect of marketed TPO receptor agonists. In the clinical 
development program of avatrombopag, abnormal liver function parameters (increased ALT, AST, AP, 
Bilirubin) have been reported in avatrombopag-treated patients and a possible hepatotoxic effect cannot 
be excluded (see also laboratory findings). The Applicant has clarified that the term “clinically significant 
liver tests” had been predefined as an adverse event of special interest in the Phase 3 avatrombopag 
clinical studies in patients with ITP (Study 302 and Study 305; ISS safety ISS Group 4). Data from those 
studies were available at the time the Study 310 and Study 311 protocols in patients with chronic liver 
disease were designed, and since no evidence of significant hepatotoxicity was identified with chronic 
avatrombopag dosing in the ITP studies, it was considered unnecessary to include it as an adverse event 
of special interest in studies of the acute 5-day treatment course in patients with chronic liver disease. 
Although not predefined as AESI, liver function tests were monitored over the course of these studies. In 
those studies, patients of both treatment groups had abnormal liver function parameters. However, 
increased liver parameters were similar or lower in avatrombopag-treated patients compared to placebo. 
Thus, since liver function abnormalities are more likely attributable to the underlying medical condition of 
patients suffering from chronic liver disease, no additional safety concerns regarding 
avatrombopag-induced hepatotoxicity arise.  
In the pooled safety analysis set of Group 1, the incidence of bleeding events Grade 1 to 4 was equally 
distributed between the pooled avatrombopag group (10.6%) and placebo group (11.5%). The incidence 
of bleeding events of WHO Grade 2 to 4 was slightly lower in the combined avatrombopag compared to 
the placebo group (3.3% avatrombopag versus 3.8% placebo). An incidence of 2.6% of 
avatrombopag-treated subjects had a bleeding event of WHO Grade 2 to 4 from randomization to 7 days 
after the procedure, with 4 of these subjects also receiving a platelet transfusion. A higher percentage, 
3.8%, of placebo-treated subjects had a WHO Grade 2 to 4 bleeding event from randomization to 7 days 
after the procedure, with 5 of these subjects also receiving a platelet transfusion. To assess the 
relationship of the bleeding events to the surgery, the underlying disease or the study drug, timing of 
onset of all reported bleedings was evaluated and summarized by the Applicant. The additional tables 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/322871/2019 
Page 103/123 
 
 
  
 
presented detailed timeline listings of each reported bleeding event (WHO Grade 2 to 4) to evaluate the 
relationship of the bleeding event to the surgery, the underlying disease or the study drug. Overall, in 
both baseline platelet count cohorts the incidence of bleeding events was similar or lower in 
avatrombopag-treated subjects compared to placebo and each event occurred in only one subject in each 
study. In both treatment groups of the Group 1 safety data set the majority of bleeding events occurred 
on the same day or after the day of the invasive procedure. The bleeding events reported prior the day of 
the invasive procedure occurred 1 to 4 days after the first avatrombopag dose and thus occurred before 
any platelet count increase effect of avatrombopag could occur. The provided timeline listings of each 
bleeding event clearly suggests that the reported bleeding events are most likely related to the underlying 
disease or the invasive procedure. No safety concerns arise from these data. 
The incidence of the adverse event of recurrence of thrombocytopenia was low in Group 1 and was only 
reported in one placebo-treated subject (0.6%). Platelet counts returning to baseline levels after study 
drug discontinuation might increase the bleeding risk in patients with CLD. Recurrence of 
thrombocytopenia was defined as a platelet count of <10×109/L and 10×109/L less than baseline count 
within 30 days of discontinuation. The Applicant has clarified that the definition of Recurrence of 
Thrombocytopenia chosen for inclusion in the phase 3 study protocols (study 310 and study 311) 
coincidences with the definition applied to other approved TPO receptor agonists such as eltrombopag and 
romiplostin. The Applicants justification of the used definition of Recurrence of Thrombocytopenia is 
acceptable. 
The AESI of thromboembolic events was reported in one subject in the 40 mg avatrombopag treatment 
group (0.4%) and two subjects (1.3%) in the placebo group. The thrombotic event of PVT in the 40 mg 
avatrombopag group occurred 13 days after the last dose and was judged as possibly related to the study 
drug. Additionally, one non treatment-emergent thrombotic AE of PVT was reported in the 60 mg 
avatrombopag treatment group 31 days after the last dose of avatrombopag. Except one subject in the 
placebo group all subjects experienced a thrombotic adverse event had platelet counts <100 000/µl. The 
subject in the placebo group had a platelet count of 144 000/µl on study day 20. Since the thrombotic 
event of myocardial infarction occurred on study day 31, no firm conclusion regarding the relationship of 
platelet counts and thromboembolic events can be drawn. However, no apparent relationship between 
thrombotic events and increased platelet counts could be identified in avatrombopag-treated subjects. 
Nevertheless, thromboembolic events are a known risk among patients with liver cirrhosis and the 
prevalence increases with the severity of the underlying disease. The risk of thromboembolic 
complications may further increase when patients undergo a surgery. However, little is known about the 
amount of platelet count increase that would increase risk of thromboembolic events in patients with 
chronic liver disease. It might be possible that any elevation of platelet counts increases the risk of 
thromboembolic events in patients who have a predisposition. The Applicant rated thromboembolic 
events as risk and a warning statement has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. This is endorsed. 
Since the spleen plays an important role in platelet storage, thromboembolic events following 
splenectomy are not uncommon. Thus, the safety profile of avatrombopag might be different in these 
patients. Although splenectomy was not defined as exclusion criteria, no safety data of patients who 
underwent a splenectomy have been included in the submitted dossier. Thus, an increased risk of 
post-splenectomy thromboembolic events cannot be ruled out. As no splenectomised patients were 
enrolled in the pivotal studies “splenectomy” is included as missing information in the RMP. 
Group 2 
In the safety analysis set of Group 2, bleeding events, thromboembolic events and Recurrence of 
thrombocytopenia were defined as adverse events of special interest. The AESI of bleeding events (WHO 
grade 2 to 4) was reported in 3.5% of subjects in the combined avatrombopag treatment group and 5.4% 
of subjects in the combined placebo treatment group. The incidence of bleeding-related events of WHO 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/322871/2019 
Page 104/123 
 
 
  
grade 2 to 4 was lower in avatrombopag-treated patients compared to placebo. No safety concerns arise 
with regard to bleeding events from the safety analysis set of Group 2.  
No subjects in the avatrombopag treatment group reported an AESI in the recurrence of 
thrombocytopenia category. 
In the pooled analysis of Group 2, thromboembolic AESI were reported in 2 subjects each in both the 
combined avatrombopag treatment group (0.5%) and the combined placebo treatment group (1.0%). In 
addition to the thromboembolic events described in Group 1, one avatrombopag-treated subject of study 
202 experienced a thromboembolic complication of PVT. The subject had a platelet count of 55 000/µl on 
the day of the thrombotic event. The thromboembolic event was judged as possibly related to the study 
drug by the investigator. Thrombotic events are a known risk among patients with liver cirrhosis and the 
prevalence increases with the severity of the underlying disease. Since this patient had a diagnosis of 
Child Pugh Class C liver disease, the risk of thromboembolic events might be increased due to the 
underlying primary disease. The risk is appropriately reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Group 3 
No AESI of thromboembolic events, bleeding events, recurrence of thrombocytopenia or gastric atrophy 
have been reported in study 203.  
Group 4 
In the pooled safety analysis of Group 4, AESI included gastric atrophy, recurrence of thrombocytopenia, 
thromboembolic events, bleeding events, neoplastic events, and clinically significant liver test 
abnormalities. The majority of AESI occurred in the bleeding events category (14.1%). The recurrence of 
thrombocytopenia AESI was reported in 8.6% of avatrombopag treated subjects, thromboembolic event 
in 7.0%, neoplastic AESI in 4.7%, and clinically significant liver test AESI in 3.9%. The time of onset for 
the majority of treatment-emergent AESI in the avatrombopag treatment group (78%, 53/68) was after 
6 weeks of dosing. 
Thromboembolic event of PVT was reported in one subject  6 days after undergoing a splenectomy. On 
Study Day 244 (5 days after splenectomy), the subject’s platelet count was greater than 400 000/µl and 
avatrombopag was discontinued. One day after discontinuation of study drug the patient experienced a 
thromboembolic complication of PVT and thrombophlebitis. Both events were considered as possibly 
related to the study drug. Since the spleen plays an important role in platelet storage, an increased risk 
of post-splenectomy thromboembolic events in patients treated with avatrombopag cannot be excluded. 
A frequency of the AESI of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) was expected to be 1% in Study 310 and Study 
311, based on results from the placebo treatment group in the ELEVATE study with eltrombopag in the 
same target patient population (EudraCT #2007-005851-40). From the review of the blinded safety data 
of over 360 patients from Study 310 and Study 311, no TEAEs of PVT had occurred with >3 times the 
expected number of patients needed to observe an expected event with an incidence of 1% . At that time, 
there was one non- treatment emergent AE of PVT in Study 310 that occurred 32 days after the last dose 
of study drug, which was assessed as not related to study drug by the investigator and Sponsor; the 
additional TEAE of PVT in an avatrombopag-treated patient in Study 311 that was not in the database at 
the time of the data cutoff would not have changed this safety assessment. There were also two PVTs that 
were identified in patients in screening prior to randomisation, which was consistent with the expected 
incidence of PVTs in this patient population. 
The risk of avatrombopag inducing or promoting fibrosis in the bone marrow is considered to be low in ITP 
patients. Since the time point of diagnosis of bone marrow fibrosis exceeded the intended 5 day treatment 
scheme of avatrombopag, no safety concerns with regard to bone marrow fibrosis raised from the 
submitted trials in ITP patients for the intended short-term use of avatrombopag. However, with the 
exception of one bleeding-related event in the placebo group, all AESI in Group 4 occurred in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/322871/2019 
Page 105/123 
 
 
  
avatrombopag treatment group. Although 78% of the reported AESI occurred after 6 weeks of dosing and 
avatrombopag is intended to be administered for short-term use (5 days), a potential long term toxicity 
of avatrombopag can be envisaged. To meet this risk, off-label use/repeat use and Bone marrow fibrosis 
(long-term use) were included in the updated RMP as important potential risk by the Applicant.  
Group 5 
In the pooled safety analysis of Group 5, Bleeding Events were the most frequently reported 
treatment-emergent AESI in the total avatrombopag (5.8%) and placebo treatment groups (4.9%), with 
a generally similar incidence between both treatment groups. No treatment-emergent AESI were 
reported in the eltrombopag treatment group. A small and similar percentage of subjects in the total 
avatrombopag and placebo treatment group reported AESI in the Recurrence of Thrombocytopenia (1.9% 
avatrombopag versus 0.4% placebo), and Thromboembolic Events (1.9% versus 0.8%), with these 
events primarily occurring in the long-term open label studies.  
Group 6 
The only treatment-emergent AESI reported in the Group 6 single-dose studies was clinically significant 
liver test abnormalities, reported by 0.4% subjects in the avatrombopag treatment group. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Deaths 
Across the clinical development program, a total of four fatal adverse events were reported in patients 
with thrombocytopenia and CLD, with three deaths in the combined avatrombopag treatment group and 
one death in the placebo treatment group. Two of the three deaths in the avatrombopag treatment group 
occurred in study 310 of the primary safety analysis (Group 1) and one death in the phase II study 202 
(Group 2). The adverse events with an outcome of death in the avatrombopag treatment group were 
multi-organ failure (26 days after the last dose), hepatic coma (30 days after the last dose) and a 
combination of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, cardiopulmonary arrest, metabolic acidosis, and 
acute renal failure (5 days after the last dose). In the placebo arm acute myocardial infarction, 
multi-organ failure and hepatocellular carcinoma were reported as cause of death. Except of 
cardiopulmonary arrest all other fatal events were judged as unlikely related to the investigational drug. 
No deaths were reported in ITP patients or healthy subjects. The applicant provided case narratives for 
each of the subject’s death.  
It is important to note that all three deaths in the avatrombopag group occurred in patients who suffered 
from Child Pugh class C liver disease whereas no death in patients with severe hepatic impairment was 
reported in the placebo arm. Although it might be possible that the fatal outcomes of hepatic coma and 
multi-organ failure (acute liver failure, acute kidney injury and respiratory failure) are associated with the 
natural progression of the underlying disease, a more detailed justification and clarification of the 
background leading to these outcomes has been provided. The very detailed review of the cases with fatal 
outcome has substantiated that it was more likely associated with the natural progression of the 
underlying disease, and no further safety issue has emerged.  
Since only a limited number of patients with severe hepatic impairment have been included and three of 
these patients have died during the clinical development program, the observation reflect that patients 
with severe hepatic impairment are known to have a higher risk of mortality and excluding these patients 
from the indication would unnecessarily limit access to those patients who need invasive procedures as 
part of their clinical management. However, the provided safety database including only 16 patients with 
Child Pugh class C liver disease is limited. Therefore, the applicant has included a warning statement in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/322871/2019 
Page 106/123 
 
 
  
the SmPC indicating that patients with Child Pugh class C liver disease should be closely monitored during 
avatrombopag treatment.  
In addition to treatment-emergent deaths, a total of four non treatment-emergent deaths were reported 
across the clinical development program. The patients died either before treatment (2 patients) or after 
the posttreatment follow-up period of the study (2 patients). The fatal adverse events following the 
30-day observation period after the last dose of avatrombopag were splenic haemorrhage 47 days after 
the last dose and decompensation of pre-existing liver cirrhosis 101 days after the last dose of 
avatrombopag (study 203). This subject  who also received antiviral therapy experienced a SAE of hepatic 
cirrhosis 47 days after the last dose of avatrombopag and died 101 days after the last dose of the study 
drug due to liver decompensation. Although the event of liver decompensation occurred 101 days after 
the last dose of study drug and avatrombopag is intended to be administered for short-term use, there 
might be an increased risk of hepatic decompensation in chronic HCV patients with cirrhosis when 
receiving interferon therapy. Since this patient who had a MELD score of 8 (Child Pugh class A liver 
disease) experienced a rapid progression of the underlying disease, the medical history and the fatal 
outcome of this patient was reviewed in details. No signals were identified which compromise the safety 
of avatrombopag in CLD.  
Serious adverse events  
Group 1 
In the primary safety analysis set (Group 1), 20 (7.3%) of 274 patients in the combined avatrombopag 
treatment group (40 or 60 mg) and 14 (9%) of 156 subjects treated with placebo experienced one or 
more nonfatal serious adverse events (SAE). Gastrointestinal haemorrhage and hyponatraemia were the 
only preferred terms reported for >1 subject in the combined avatrombopag group (0.7% avatrombopag 
versus none in placebo each). The incidence of treatment-related SAE was low and similar between the 
avatrombopag and placebo treatment group (0.4% in avatrombopag versus 1.3% in placebo). All 
treatment-related SAEs were reported in a single patient each. The overall incidence of TESAE was similar 
between both treatment groups and is considered consistent with the underlying medical condition of the 
study population. However, numerical imbalances were identified between the two pivotal phase III 
studies. The incidence of SAEs was significantly higher in study 310 compared to study 311 (12.2% in the 
combined avatrombopag group of study 310 versus 1.6% in the combined avatrombopag group of study 
311). Whereas in study 311 the incidence of SAE was very low and similar between both baseline platelet 
count cohorts and placebo, considerable differences were observed in study 310. In the low baseline 
platelet count cohort of study 310, the incidence of SAEs war significantly lower for patients treated with 
60 mg avatrombopag compared to placebo (11.2% 60 mg avatrombopag versus 22.9% placebo). 
However, significantly higher rates of SAEs have been reported in patients treated with 40 mg 
avatrombopag (high baseline platelet count cohort) compared to placebo (13.8% 40 mg avatrombopag 
versus 3.1% placebo). While none of these events in the 40 mg avatrombopag treatment group were 
judged as related to the study drug, the differences between the avatrombopag and placebo group is 
explained since none of the reported SAE in the 40 mg avatrombopag group occurred in more than one 
subject. The demographic and baseline characteristics were comparable between the baseline platelet 
count cohorts and thus would not explain the observed differences between the treatment groups. The 
difference in the incidence of SAEs between avatrombopag and placebo treatment groups was not 
observed in study 311 with comparable rates between treatments groups of both baseline platelet 
cohorts. Although the reflection does not satisfactorily explain the reported higher incidence of SAE in the 
40 mg avatrombopag group compared to placebo, it cannot be further clarified.  
Group 2 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/322871/2019 
Page 107/123 
 
 
  
In the safety analysis of Group 2, 36 (9.1%) of 395 patients in the combined avatrombopag treatment 
group (40 or 60 mg) and 18 (8.8%) of 204 subjects treated with placebo experienced nonfatal SAE. 
Abdominal pain, acute kidney injury, acute respiratory failure, anaemia, cellulitis, gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage, hyponatraemia, liver disorder and pneumonia were the only preferred terms reported in 
>1 subject in the avatrombopag group (2 patients each). The incidence of SAE in the pooled analysis of 
group 2 was low and similar between both treatment groups and revealed a similar pattern to that 
reported in group 1. No safety concerns arise from the Group 2 safety analysis set. 
Group 3 
In the safety analysis of Group 3 (study 203), no SAEs were reported during the treatment period A1 
(prior antiviral therapy). In the Core Study, one subject (6.3%) in the avatrombopag 10 mg group 
reported a SAE of thrombocytopenia and one subject in the avatrombopag 30 mg group reported SAE of 
paraesthesia. The SAE of paraesthesia was judged as being related to the study drug. In the combined 
Core and OLE study a total of 20.3% subjects experienced SAE with three of those were life threatening 
(neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia). Since hematologic AEs like cytopenias are commonly 
associated with antiviral treatment, no safety concerns raised from study 203.  
Group 4 
In the safety analysis of Group 4, 25% of subjects in the avatrombopag treatment group, 0% in the 
eltrombopag treatment group and 4.5% of subjects treated with placebo experienced nonfatal SAE. 
Thrombocytopenia, vomiting and platelet count decreased were the only preferred terms reported in >3 
subject in the avatrombopag group. Treatment-related SAEs were reported in 9.4% of subjects in the 
avatrombopag treatment group. In general, in long-term studies the incidence of SAE was higher in 
avatrombopag-treated patients compared to the placebo treatment group. However, since avatrombopag 
is intended to be administered for short-term use of 5 days, no safety concerns with regard to SAE raised 
from the studies in ITP patients for the intended indication.  
Group 5 
In the safety analysis of Group 5, 13.8% of subjects in the avatrombopag treatment group, 7.8% of 
subjects treated with placebo experienced nonfatal SAE. There were no SAEs reported in the eltrombopag 
treatment group. The most frequently reported TESAE was thrombocytopenia, reported by 1.7% of 
subjects in the total avatrombopag treatment group and no subjects in the total placebo treatment group. 
Of note, thrombocytopenia was only reported by subjects receiving avatrombopag in the long-term 
studies. In general, in long-term studies the incidence of SAE was higher in avatrombopag-treated 
compared to the placebo group. Treatment-related TESAEs was higher in the total avatrombopag 
treatment group (3.1%) when compared to the total placebo treatment group (1.2%). 
Group 6 
No SAE were reported in the phase 1 studies. 
Laboratory findings 
The applicant presents multiple tables and figures, and this is acknowledged, and has additionally 
provided individual tables which summarise patient exposure, special populations, MedDRA terms related 
to age, and laboratory findings for ISS Groups 1, 2, and 5, side by side, and no safety signals emerged.  
However, in Group 1 platelet count on Procedure Day (Day 10) for the 60-mg avatrombopag-treated 
subjects was 65.3×109/L in the Low Baseline Platelet Count Cohort and 86.7×109/L in the High Baseline 
Platelet Count Cohort which roughly corresponds to a doubling of the baseline count. About 1% of patients 
treated with avatrombopag showed platelet counts exceeding 200×109/L which might be a meaningful 
threshold for thromboembolic events in the indicated population. The incidence of high platelet counts in 
Assessment report

patients implies that the risk for exaggerated rise of thrombocytes in patients treated with avatrombopag 
over a period of 5 days is low. The risk individually in high increments in platelet counts and a potential 
thrombotic risk is adequately reflected in the SmPC.  
Haematology parameters seemed to show some minor changes in in subjects treated with Doptelet. A 
decrease of blood cells and hemoglobin in some patients treated with avatrombopag has been observed 
and was further elaborated. 
Clinical chemistry parameters (e.g. ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, GGT, albumin) were 
presented at baseline, day 4, procedure day, day 7 after procedure and follow up. However only a small 
number of patients was investigated on day 4 and 7 after treatment. ALT, AST, AP and Bilirubin showed 
an increase after treatment with Doptelet in the avatrombopag group but returned to baseline at the time 
of follow up. No specific safety concern related to hepatotoxic effect arise from the data presented, 
because elevations in liver function tests were similar in the avatrombopag treatment group in 
comparison to the placebo group on the days of monitoring including the day of follow up.  
Urinalysis did not show significant differences between treatment and placebo groups. 
Vital signs did not show meaningful changes after the treatment with avatrombopag.  
ECG results were unaltered and no meaningful prolongation of QTc was observed in most of the patients. 
Safety in special populations 
Safety in special populations has been evaluated for the subgroups of age, sex, race, geographic region, 
baseline platelet count, bleeding risk, HCC status, MELD and Child Pugh score and disease etiology for the 
Groups 1 and 2. 
The frequency of AEs in subjects <65 is similar in the treatment and placebo group in Group 1 and 2. A 
comprehensive subgroup analysis by age has been presented. Only twelve patients over 75 were exposed 
to avatrombopag. Out of these one patient was over 85. Abdominal pain was reported more frequently in 
the age group of 65-74, however the incidence was similar in the treatment and the placebo group. 
Pyrexia was reported more frequently in the age group of 75+ but the incidence was higher in the placebo 
group than in the avatrombopag group. 
The incidence of adverse events was higher in females in the treatment and in the placebo group. Due to 
this fact this finding does not seem to be treatment-related.  
The incidence of AEs was higher in Asian subjects than in White subjects in the avatrombopag and in the 
placebo group (Group1). Therefore this finding is not suspected to be treatment-related. The number of 
black people and “other” was very low and no final conclusion can be drawn whether there are differences 
in the safety profile of avatrombopag in these subgroups. 
The subgroup analysis does not show TEAE-relation depending on the geographic region. 
The incidence of TEAEs was slightly higher in the low baseline platelet count group (60 mg 
avatrombopag/placebo) than in the high baseline platelet count group (40 mg avatrombopag/placebo) 
(Group1). However the incidence of AEs in the placebo groups was very similar to the treatment groups, 
relationship to the treatment seems unlikely. 
Slight differences in the incidence of reported TEAEs within the high bleeding risk subgroup were reported 
regarding the SOCs General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions, Respiratory, Thoracic and 
Mediastinal Disorders, Psychiatric Disorders, and Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders. No specific 
pattern of AEs could be recognized in the respective subgroup. The slight differences might occur due to 
a limited number of patients and do not give rise to specific concern . 
The subgroup suffering from liver cancer showed more TEAEs in the treatment group which is especially 
significant in the low baseline platelet count group (60 mg avatrombopag 74.4 % versus 52.0 % in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/322871/2019 
Page 109/123 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
placebo group - Group1). Increased ALT has been shown in 13.3 % in the treatment group and in 3.9% 
in the placebo group and is not listed in the HCC-neg. Pyrexia showed the most significant difference (23 
% treatment group, 11.9 % in the placebo group). The incidence of abdominal pain and oedema 
peripheral also showed a slight difference. However the number of patients was limited and most of the 
AEs have been reported in only a few patients in each treatment group. No specific pattern of AEs could 
be recognized. No drug induced hepatotoxicity could be identified in the HCC subgroup. 
Across the Child Pugh B subgroup (Group 1) the incidence of AEs was slightly higher in both treatment 
groups (high and low baseline platelet count) than in the placebo groups. The incidence of TEAEs in Child 
Pugh Class C patients especially in the high baseline platelet count group was much higher than in the 
placebo group (66.7 % versus 40 % in Group 1 and 80.6 % versus 54.5 % in Group 2). However the 
number of patients treated with avatrombopag was low and a final conclusion cannot be drawn for the 
safety of Doptelet in Child-Pugh C patients. However, no signals of hepatotoxicity has emerged by 
treatment with avatrombopag across classes.  
The subgroup analysis by disease etiology showed only a slight trend for more frequent AEs in the 
treatment groups in alcoholic liver disease and chronic viral hepatitis. 
Data have been presented in individual tables that provide an overview of all adverse events as a function 
of intrinsic factors across the ISS safety analysis ISS Groups 1, 2, and 5. The safety data in these tables 
did not identify any new or untoward safety concerns as a function of intrinsic factors. The side effect 
profile for avatrombopag was generally comparable to placebo without clinically meaningful differences. 
Data have also been presented to provide safety analyses of extrinsic factors as per ICH guideline E5(R1), 
and provide a single table that summarizes the results for groups 1, 2 and 5. The analysis support the 
safety in avatrombopag treatment in the trial design, without clinically meaningful differences between 
placebo and TPO analogue avatrombopag. The difference in placebo and treatment group 5 are expected. 
Immunological events 
No information has been given on the immunogenicity of Doptelet. Due to the fact that Doptelet 
represents a small molecule, no immunological reaction is to be expected. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The Applicant has not performed specific safety analyses for drug-drug interactions. However, drug-drug 
interactions are discussed elsewhere, clinical pharmacology and non-clinical pharmacology. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
Across Group 1 and 2 only three avatrombopag-treated patients (0.8%) discontinued the study drug 
prematurely due to adverse events. The causes for discontinuation were myalgia and anaemia in one 
subject, pyrexia in one subject and vomiting and nausea in another subject. In Group 3, only one patient 
treated with placebo discontinued study drug due to the adverse event of rash. The frequency and type of 
findings in Groups 1-3 does not seem to give rise to concern. 
In Group 4, 13.3% of subjects treated with avatrombopag and 9.1% of subjects treated with eltrombopag 
discontinued study drug due to TEAEs. In the avatrombopag group, the only TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation of study drug reported in more than 1 subject were platelet count increased and headache 
(3.9% and 1.6% of subjects). Treatment-related TESAEs leading to study drug discontinuation were only 
reported in avatrombopag-treated subjects (3.9%) and included leukocytosis, myocardial infarction, 
cerebrovascular accident, dizziness, headache, and transient ischemic attack. Although, the incidence of 
TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation was higher in the avatrombopag treatment group compared 
to the placebo group, no safety concerns evoked for the intended short-term use of avatrombopag in 
patients with thrombocytopenia and CLD. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/322871/2019 
Page 110/123 
 
 
  
 
In Group 5, the incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug was higher in the total 
avatrombopag treatment group (3.6% [21/587] subjects) when compared to the total placebo treatment 
group (0.4% [1/243] subjects) and lower than the eltrombopag treatment group (9.1% [1/11] subjects. 
Platelet count increased was the most frequently reported TEAE leading to discontinuation of study drug 
in the total avatrombopag treatment group.  
In Group 6, a total of 0.5% of subjects in the avatrombopag treatment group and 0.0% of subjects in the 
placebo treatment group experienced TEAEs leading to discontinuation from the single-dose studies. 
Thrombocytosis was the cause for discontinuation in 0.2% of subjects. One subject discontinued due to 
vomiting, influenza-like illness, ALT increased, myalgia, and headache. A thorough review of this case in 
a phase 1 study, showed a mild course and full recovery, and no further safety concerns.  
2.6.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
A total of 1365 subjects have been randomized across 24 studies in the avatrombopag development 
program. The total safety database comprises 1107 persons, who had received at least 1 dose of 
avatrombopag and had at least 1 post-dose safety assessment, including 520 healthy volunteers (one or 
multiple doses), 395 patients with CLD and thrombocytopenia undergoing a scheduled diagnostic or 
surgical procedure, 64 subjects with hepatitis C-related thrombocytopenia and 128 patients with chronic 
ITP. A total of 435 patients were enrolled in the two identical, pivotal, phase 3 studies (310 and 311) and 
169 patients in the two supportive, phase 2 studies (202 and 204). No patient appears to have been 
included twice. Study 204 (n=39) was a study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of 
once-daily oral avatrombopag in a Japanese target population. The safety data base is adequate, and the 
number of persons exposed to avatrombopag is deemed adequate for the safety evaluation.    
The pooled safety data in pivotal study 310 and 311 (Group 1) included a total of 430 randomized 
subjects, with 274 subjects in the combined avatrombopag treatment group, and 156 subjects in the 
combined placebo treatment group across the 2 baseline platelet count cohorts.  
Treatment in the five day dosing with avatrombopag was not observed in the data reviewed here 
presented by the Applicant to be associated with any clinically significant changes in the incidence or type 
of AEs, TESAEs, Grade 3 of 4 AEs, AESI or clinically meaningful changes in laboratory haematology, 
chemistry, liver function or ECG values. Patients previously treated with avatrombopag have been 
excluded from studies 310 and 311. However retreatment of subjects with avatrombopag is likely to 
occur, since patients (e.g. suffering from hepatic cancer) might undergo invasive procedures (e.g. 
radiofrequency ablation) for several times. There is only little or no experience in previously treated 
subjects. The risks of retreatment with avatrombopag are reflected in the SmPC. The most frequently 
reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) are considered to be consistent with the underlying 
primary disease of the study population and the nature of the invasive procedures. In the pooled analysis 
of the primary safety data set (Group 1), the most common TEAEs in at least 5% of subjects were pyrexia 
(9.9% in the avatrombopag group versus 9.0% in the placebo group), abdominal pain (6.6% versus 
6.4%), nausea (6.6% versus 7.1%) and headache (5.5% versus 6.4%). No adverse events occurring in 
≥ 3% of subjects had a ≥ 2% higher incidence in the avatrombopag group than in the placebo group. No 
substantial differences were noted between the treatment groups. However, the incidence of Grade 3-5 
TEAEs in study 310 was inconsistent between the treatment groups in the two baseline platelet count 
cohorts. While the incidence of Grade 3-5 TEAEs was lower in the avatrombopag 60 mg group compared 
to placebo (7.9% avatrombopag versus 16.7% placebo), a higher incidence has been observed in the 
avatrombopag 40 mg group compared to the placebo group (17.2% avatrombopag versus 0% placebo). 
A thorough review of TEAEs according to intrinsic and extrinsic factors and based on case narratives did 
not demonstrate a safety concern. However, special warnings are reflected in the SmPC regarding 
Assessment report

Page 111/123 
 
 
  
patients with the most severe CLD, the individual increase in platelet count at procedure day and the 
circumstance with missing information.  
In the primary safety analysis adverse events of special interest included bleeding events, 
thromboembolic events and recurrence of thrombocytopenia. The incidence of bleeding events of WHO 
Grade 2 to 4 was slightly lower in the combined avatrombopag compared to the placebo group (3.3% 
avatrombopag versus 3.8% placebo). To assess the relationship of the bleeding events to the surgery, 
the underlying disease or the study drug, timing of onset of all reported bleeding-related events was 
evaluated and summarized by the applicant. No avatrombopag-treated subject experienced an AESI of 
Recurrence of Thrombocytopenia. The incidence of thromboembolic events was lower in the 
avatrombopag group (0.4%) compared to the placebo group (1.3%). Thromboembolic events were not 
associated with increased platelet counts. However, it might be possible that any elevation of platelet 
counts increases the risk of thromboembolic events in patients who have a predisposition (liver cirrhosis, 
surgery). The risk of thromboembolic events is adequately reflected in section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Since the spleen plays an important role in platelet storage, thromboembolic events following 
splenectomy are not uncommon. The safety profile of avatrombopag might be different in these patients. 
Although splenectomy was not defined as exclusion criteria, no safety data of patients who underwent a 
splenectomy have been included in the submitted dossier. Splenectomy was included as missing 
information in the RMP.  
The two pivotal studies were blinded. Still, it may be considered if reporting of AEs may be biased, if the 
effect of the placebo versus active treatment may be evident from the platelet count at procedure day. 
Still, the platelet count must be known prior to a scheduled procedure in patients with a coagulopathy 
following a therapeutic intervention, and platelet counts fluctuate frequently, as evidenced by higher 
values in the placebo cohort. Therefore the study design and conductance is accepted. 
Across the clinical development program, a total of four fatal adverse events were reported in patients 
with thrombocytopenia and CLD, with three deaths in the combined avatrombopag treatment group and 
one death in the placebo treatment group. The adverse events with an outcome of death in the 
avatrombopag treatment group were multi-organ failure (26 days after the last dose), hepatic coma (30 
days after the last dose) and a combination of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, cardiopulmonary 
arrest, metabolic acidosis, and acute renal failure (5 days after the last dose). Except for cardiopulmonary 
arrest all other fatal events were judged as unlikely related to the investigational drug. It is important to 
note that all three deaths in the avatrombopag group occurred in patients who suffered from Child Pugh 
class C liver disease whereas no death in patients with severe hepatic impairment was reported in the 
placebo arm. The very detailed review of the cases with fatal outcome has substantiated that it was more 
likely associated with the natural progression of the underlying disease, and no further safety issue has 
emerged. A warning was included in the SmPC to emphasize the need for close monitoring of patients with 
advanced Child-Pugh (class C) disease. The rate of study drug discontinuations due to AEs was very low 
and did not raise any safety concerns for the intended short-term use of avatrombopag.  
Laboratory findings were presented and include parameters of hematology, chemistry and urinalysis. A 
serious risk in the treatment with avatrombopag could be an excessive increase of platelets which might 
represent an increased risk for thromboembolic events. About 1% of patients treated with avatrombopag 
showed platelet counts exceeding 200×109/L which might be a meaningful threshold for thromboembolic 
events in the indicated population. The incidence of high platelet counts in patients implies that the risk 
for exaggerated rise of thrombocytes in patients treated with avatrombopag over a period of 5 days is 
low. The risk is adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/322871/2019

The five-day, oral treatment period, once daily may facilitate the results of safety assessment. Subjects 
with any TEAE constituted 54% (n=148/274) in the compiled avatrombopag treated Group 1 patients, 
versus 55.1% (n=86/156) in the comparable placebo population. Subjects with any grade 3 or 4 TEAEs in 
study 310+311 combined were 10.2% (n=24) as to 9.6% (n=15) treated by placebo in Group 1, without 
a specific relation to a MedDRA Preferred term.  
The safety of avatrombopag in Group 1 is further supported by safety data from the Phase 1 and Phase 2 
studies with avatrombopag, which included various doses, formulations, and single and multiple dose 
regimens in both healthy volunteers and subjects with various clinical conditions. The adverse events 
appear to be only temporary, except the few irreversible outcomes, and are manageable.   
The treatment-emergent SAE by ≥2 subjects in the active treatment group in Group 5 related to 
thrombocytopenia (1.7% n=10/587), and anaemia, vomiting, abdominal pain, acute kidney injury, 
platelet count decreased, pneumonia and urinary tract infection (all less than 0.7%). Still, in the 
management of this patient-population these SAEs may be expected, without a predisposition to a 
specific cause and are potentially reversible within hours to days. The Applicant has adequately assessed 
events of special interest, deaths, vascular manifestations (embolism or bleeding). However, numerical 
imbalances were identified between the two pivotal phase III studies. The incidence of SAEs was 
significantly higher in study 310 compared to study 311 (12.2% avatrombopag group of study 310 versus 
1.6% avatrombopag group of study 311). Additionally, a higher incidence of SAEs has been observed in 
the high-platelet baseline group compared to placebo while the incidence of SAEs was lower in the 
low-platelet baseline arm compared to placebo. However, none of the reported SAE in the 40 mg 
avatrombopag group occurred in more than one subject, and it was clarified that the demographic and 
baseline characteristics were comparable between the baseline platelet count cohorts and thus would not 
explain the observed differences between the treatment groups. The difference in the incidence of SAEs 
between avatrombopag and placebo treatment groups was not observed in study 311 with comparable 
rates between treatments groups of both baseline platelet cohorts, and the issue is considered to be 
caused by variations in studies, and the united results to reflect avatrombopag treatment.  
The data demonstrate that the safety of avatrombopag is comparable to placebo in these studies with a 
very low risk for fatal outcome, no (significant) increase in the incidence of hepatotoxicity, 
thromboembolic or bleeding events, infections or other unacceptable manifestations in 
avatrombopag-treated subjects. During follow-up upon discontinuation of TPO-receptor agonist and the 
stimulation of megakaryocytes and thrombocyte production, rebound thrombocytopenia did not manifest 
as a problem.  
However, the provided safety database is limited for Child Pugh Class C patients and no firm conclusion 
regarding the safety profile of avatrombopag can be drawn. The applicant is asked to provide a feasibility 
study on the performance of a post authorization safety study (PASS). Furthermore, the applicant has 
included a warning statement in the SmPC indicating that patients with Child Pugh class C liver disease 
should be closely monitored during avatrombopag treatment. 
2.6.3.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Avatrombopag is considered to be safe and well tolerated by patients with CLD and severe 
thrombocytopenia scheduled for an invasive procedure. Issues in critical clinical circumstances (e.g. 
treatment of Child Pugh Class C patients) are reflected in the SmPC and RMP. Performance of a Post 
marketing safety study in this patient group will be assessed post-marketing.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 2.0 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle 
with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 21.05.2018. The new EURD list entry will therefore use 
the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of avatrombopag with active substances contained in authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture 
of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers avatrombopag to be a new active substance as it is not 
a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Doptelet (avatrombopag) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it is a new active substance. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

The applicant is claiming this indication: “Doptelet is indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in 
patients with chronic liver disease who are scheduled to undergo a procedure.” 
Chronic liver disease (CLD), independent of aetiology, is commonly associated with thrombocytopenia 
due to a number of different causes. Contributing factors are, among others, decreased hepatic 
production of the haematopoietic growth factor thrombopoetin, sequestration of platelets in the spleen 
and suppression of the bone marrow.  
Thrombocytopenia is defined as a platelet count below 150 x109/L. It can be further specified as moderate 
(50-100 x109/L) and severe (<50 x109/L). Low platelet counts in CLD increase the risk of bleeding during 
and after surgery and invasive procedures. Clinical practice guidelines vary with their recommendation of 
desirable platelet levels before attempting an elective procedure. However, it is generally agreed that 
many invasive procedures like liver biopsies can be done safely with platelet counts above 50-75 x109/L. 
Avatrombopag is an orally active, small-molecule thrombopoetin (TPO) receptor agonist. TPO receptor 
agonists upregulate platelet production by stimulating differentiation of haematopoietic stem cells and 
megakaryocyte progenitor cells to megakaryocytes and their proliferation, thus upregulating platelet 
production. As platelet response with TPO receptor agonists takes several days, agents of this class are 
suitable for prophylaxis of bleeding and not suitable when haemostasis is needed on an emergency basis. 
The objective of avatrombopag therapy is to elevate platelet levels into an acceptable range in order to 
minimize bleeding risk during elective invasive procedures in patients with CLD. 
Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The standard of care for patients with chronic liver disease and severe thrombocytopenia before a 
scheduled invasive procedure with a risk of bleeding is to diagnose and treat other factors which 
contribute to increase the bleeding risk (if possible, e.g. vitamin B and K supplement, examine for 
bleeding conditions if relevant) and in the situation to administer platelet transfusions. Platelet 
transfusions, containing viable cells from a number of donors (pooled cell concentrate), carry the risk of 
transfusion reactions and infections, contaminated from donor or in the hospital system. Thrombocytes 
are immunogenic active cells and patients who receive repeated transfusions may become refractory. The 
administration of platelet transfusion and number of cell products depends upon the spontaneous platelet 
count at procedure day in the individual patient and the individual scheduled procedure.  
Lusutrombopag, a TPO-receptor agonists was recently authorised in Europe for the use in patients with 
thrombocytopenia.   
Main clinical studies 
The dossier includes two pivotal, phase 3 clinical trials for avatrombopag, study 310 and 311. In addition, 
two phase 2 studies, 202 and 204 are supportive for the application.

Both pivotal trials have a randomized, global, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study 
design to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-daily oral avatrombopag for the treatment of adults 
with thrombocytopenia associated with chronic liver disease prior to an elective procedure. The 
supportive studies have a similar design and included dose finding and a study in Japanese patients (n 
=39).  
The studies 310 and 311 included a total of 231 and 204 CLD patients, respectively, mostly Caucasian 
(60%), and patients of Asian ethnicity (33%). All patients had severe thrombocytopenia. The patients 
were randomized 2:1 to active treatment with avatrombopag or placebo, respectively. The dosage of 
avatrombopag was individually decided according to the baseline platelet count in the screening period, in 
this way: once daily, 40 mg if count was ≥40 and <50 x109/L, and 60 mg if count <40 x109/L. The 
scheduled procedure was performed 5-8 days after the last dose of study drug (on day 10 – 13).   
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary efficacy endpoint in both pivotal Phase 3 studies was the proportion of subjects who did not 
require a platelet transfusion or any rescue procedure for bleeding after randomization and up to 7 days 
following a scheduled procedure. Responders were defined as subjects who did not require a platelet 
transfusion or rescue procedure for bleeding. The primary endpoint was reached by 66.9% (95% CI 59.6 
– 74.2) in the 60 mg cohort (low baseline platelet count), and by 88.0% (95% CI 82.2 – 93.9) in the 40 
mg cohort (high baseline platelet count). In the corresponding placebo control groups, a response for the 
primary endpoint was achieved by 28.6% (CI 95% 19.3 – 37.9) in the low baseline platelet cohort and in 
35.8% (95% CI 24.3 – 47.3) in the high baseline cohor. The results were consistent between the two 
pivotal studies. The results in pooled analysis demonstrated a treatment difference in the proportion of 
subjects not requiring a platelet transfusion or any rescue procedure for bleeding of 36.3% in the low 
baseline platelet group and of 52.2% in the high baseline platelet group.  
The first secondary endpoint, defined as the proportion of patients achieving a platelet count ≥50 x 
10(9)/L on  procedure day was achieved in (pooled data) 68.1% (95 CI 60.9 – 75.3) in the low platelet 
baseline group, and in 90.6% (95% CI 85.3 – 95.9). In the corresponding placebo group 5.5% (95% CI 
0.8 – 10.2) in the low baseline platelet group and 29.9% (95% CI 18.9 – 40.8) in the high baseline 
platelet group, respectively. Again, acceptable consistency was observed across the two studies, and the 
primary endpoint, and the first secondary endpoint each demonstrate the effect of the treatment.  
The effect was observed across all CLD patients according to MELD score, whereas patients with 
Child-Pugh class C and a platelet count < 40 G/L at baseline did not have effect of treatment by primary 
or first secondary endpoint. Forest plot analysis showed a beneficial effect across demographic factors, 
platelet count and risk of bleeding according to procedure. 
However, the wording of the indication must reflect the studied population with platelet counts below 50 
G/L, thus:  “Doptelet is indicated for the treatment of severe thrombocytopenia in adult patients with 
chronic liver disease who are scheduled to undergo an invasive procedure.” 
Avatrombopag is an oral TPO-receptor agonist which may be taken by the patient at home, once daily in 
five days. The planned increase in the platelet count to desired levels to coincide (day 10-13) with a 
scheduled procedure has been demonstrated, and overshoot in thrombocyte counts are rare. Monitoring 
the increment in platelets in blood samples on day 3-4 may prevent a full five day pulse of avatrombopag 
in patients with excessive response. In this way an increase in risk for ischaemic events may be reduced, 
but the planned procedure on day 10-13 still performed due to the half-life of platelets produced by the 
bone marrow in the patient.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Differences between East Asian populations and Caucasian appear to exist in terms of exposure which is 
attributed to the higher bodyweight in the Caucasian subpopulation. Furthermore, a less sensitive PD 
response in the East Asian population was apparent in the pop PK/PD analysis. The integrated efficacy 
analysis of the pivotal trials, including a mixed population showed comparable efficacy between races. 
Still, it is not quite clear why the differences in exposures of avatrombopag between Caucasian and 
Chinese subjects are observed. It seems as if there is no relevant impact on PD or efficacy emerging from 
the differences in PK exposure. Furthermore, there are no racial differences in the activities of the main 
metabolic pathway enzymes of avatrombopag. 
While there are comprehensive data illustrating the efficacy of a single cycle of treatment with 
avatrombopag, there are no data supporting the efficacy of Doptelet after repeated administration. A 
relevant warning was included in the SmPC. 
There is limited information on the use of avatrombopag in patients with severe (Child-Pugh class C, 
MELD score > 24) hepatic impairment. Avatrombopag should only be used in such patients if the 
expected benefit outweighs the expected risks (see SmPC). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The total safety database comprises 1107 persons, who had received at least 1 dose of avatrombopag and 
had at least 1 post-dose safety assessment, including 520 healthy volunteers (one or multiple doses), 395 
patients with CLD and thrombocytopenia undergoing a scheduled diagnostic or surgical procedure, 64 
subjects with hepatitis C-related thrombocytopenia and 128 patients with chronic ITP. A total of 435 
patients were enrolled in the two identical, pivotal, phase 3 studies (310 and 311) and 169 patients in the 
two supportive, phase 2 studies (202 and 204). 
TEAEs (any) reported in the pivotal trials in patients suffering from CLD accompanied by severe 
thrombocytopenia were reported in 54.0% in the combined treatment group and in 55.1% in the placebo 
group. Grade 3/4 TEAEs were observed in 10.9% and 10.3%, respectively. Consistent results were seen 
in the supportive studies. The most frequent adverse events were pyrexia (9.9%) and abdominal pain 
(6.6%). No substantial difference is noted between the avatrombopag and placebo groups, and TEAEs 
were not related to recommended dose.  
The Applicant has adequately described adverse events of special interest, including thrombosis and 
bleeding. The thromboembolic events affected 1 patient (0.4%) related to avatrombopag treatment, a 
portal vein thrombosis, whereas one patient had a myocardial infarction, one patient a pulmonary 
embolism with DIC in the placebo group in the pivotal trials. Bleeding events (reported as WHO grade 2-4) 
was registered in 3.3% (n=9) by active treatment, compared to 3.8% (n=6) by placebo in the combined 
data study 310+311. The bleeding symptoms in these 15 patients were distributed across 12 causes by 
preferred term.  
Across the clinical development program, a total of four fatal adverse events were reported in patients 
with thrombocytopenia associated with CLD, with three deaths in the combined avatrombopag treatment 
group and one death in the placebo treatment group. The adverse events with an outcome of death in the 
avatrombopag treatment group were multi-organ failure, hepatic coma and a combination of acute 
hypercapnic respiratory failure, cardiopulmonary arrest, metabolic acidosis, and acute renal failure. 
Except for cardiopulmonary arrest all other fatal events were judged as unlikely related to avatrombopag.

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
A limited number of patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh class C) have been included in 
the clinical development program of avatrombopag. The administration of avatrombopag in this 
vulnerable subgroup at higher risk for thromboembolic events has been justified, however uncertainties 
remain on the safety aspects in this subgroup, which will be further monitored through additional PhV 
activities (see RMP). Relevant warnings have also been included in the SmPC. 
Chronic HCV patients with severe hepatic impairment may be at risk of hepatic decompensation when 
receiving avatrombopag in combination with interferon. No patients were enrolled in the phase 3 studies 
while treated with interferons. Considering the progress in antiviral treatment by non-interferon based 
agent, the uncertainty of a five-day pulse treatment with avatrombopag is not an issue, but is reflected as 
missing information in the RMP. A warning has also been included in the SmPC.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The efficacy of avatrombopag given as a five-day, oral treatment according to platelet count in the 
individual patient was demonstrated. Most procedures could be performed as the target platelet count at 
procedure day was achieved and also without a significant proportion of patients experiencing an 
overshoot and increased risk of thrombosis. The decrease on platelet count after cessation of stimulation 
of the megakaryocytes and platelet production is steady over 2-3 weeks, without a risk of a rebound 
phenomenon, and then increased risk of bleeding. The results are supported by the second secondary 
endpoint of a significantly higher increment in platelet count by treatment. The favourable effect is 
clinically meaningful. Being a small-molecule avatrombopag may be used repeatedly in the same 
individuals, as the platelet count is not expected to improve in this patient population. 
The treatment with avatrombopag may be taken at home, once daily for only five days. Planned 
procedures may be performed with a high probability, because the platelet count peaked ten days later 
(10-13 days) in most patients. It may be considered that an insufficient response in the increase of 
absolute platelet count does not necessarily mean that an elective procedure is cancelled, because a 
platelet transfusion can still be used to attempt achieving platelet counts that permit the scheduled 
surgery. It is recommended for all procedures that the treating specialist individually assesses the 
increment in platelet count on the day of the procedure and decides whether a follow-up within days is 
necessary (and the procedure is postponed), or initiate other necessary intervention in patients with a 
high increase (even within normal range, from baseline) due to the risk of thrombosis (see SmPC 4.2). A 
specific monitoring for TEAEs is recommended in all patients with Child-Pugh class C treated with 
avatrombopag. 
The observed unfavourable effects were generally consistent with the multi-morbidity of the investigated 
population and the nature of the invasive procedure and no substantial imbalance with regard to the 
nature and severity of adverse events observed in the placebo group was apparent. Non-fatal TEAEs and 
SAEs may be considered to be in general temporary, reversible and manageable within hours to days of 
supportive treatment. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The five-day oral treatment with avatrombopag has favourable effects with benefits for the possibility to 
conduct scheduled procedures that outweigh the risks of avatrombopag in the target population / patients 
with severe thrombocytopenia associated with chronic liver disease. Avatrombopag is considered to be 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/322871/2019

safe and well tolerated and uncertainties concerning critical clinical circumstances (e.g. treatment of Child 
Pugh Class C patients) are sufficiently reflected in the SmPC and RMP. Therefore, the Benefit/Risk balance 
is considered positive. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Doptelet is positive.

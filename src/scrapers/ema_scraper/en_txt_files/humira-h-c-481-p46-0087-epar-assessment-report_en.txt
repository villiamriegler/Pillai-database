Introduction 
On 29 May 2015, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Humira, in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
The study was performed in an adult Japanese population. However, the definition of “adult” in Japan 
differs to that from in Europe and for each of the four studies the minimum age requirement for 
enrolment was 15 years of age. As such, 3 subjects of what are defined in Europe as “paediatric” 
patients (i.e. less than 18 years of age) were enrolled. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric 
studies do not influence the benefit risk for Humira and that there is no consequential regulatory 
action. 
This report contains the assessment of this study report, with focus on the paediatric patients. 
1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
40 mg/0.8 mL syringe for subcutaneous injection. 
1.2.  Clinical aspects 
1.2.1.  Introduction 
Humira was approved in Japan for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients showing an 
inadequate response to conventional therapy, in April2008. One of the conditions of approval of 
Humira by Japanese regulatory authority (Health, Labour and Welfare Ministry (MHLW)) was request to 
conduct a large-scale Post Marketing Observational Study (PMOS) to investigate the long-term safety 
of Humira, particularly associated with the development of infections and malignant tumors.  
1.2.2.  Clinical study 
Clinical study number and title 
P12-070:  
Special Investigation (Long-term Treatment in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis) 
Description 
Study P12-070 was a single-cohort, non-interventional observational study with objective to collect 
information on the safety and effectiveness of HUMIRA during a 3-year period for the treatment of RA, 
to clarify the following: 
1) Incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the clinical setting 
2) Incidence of infections and malignant tumors in the clinical setting 
3) Factors affecting the safety and effectiveness of HUMIRA treatment

Study population /Sample size 
Patients who had completed the preceding 24-week PMOS (all-case PMOS) were enrolled in this study. 
Patients with "Presence" of the below items 1) and 2) were suitable for the study registration. 
1) Presence/absence of Humira treatment at the beginning of the survey. 
2) Presence/absence of Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) or Modified HAQ (MHAQ) evaluation at 
baseline. 
In Study P12-070 patients were followed up from week 24 to 3 years of treatment. Information on the 
safety and effectiveness of HUMIRA treatment was collected once every 6 months, using an electronic 
data capture system or printed case report forms (CRFs). 
The following information was collected at the different time points: 
1) 
The history of anti-TNF therapy, Humira treatment, concomitant drug information, including 
disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), biologics and glucocorticoids, surgical treatment for 
RA, effectiveness evaluation (Disease Activity Score 28 4 ESR (DAS28-4 ESR) and MHAQ, and adverse 
events were collected in CRF once every 6 months from 24 weeks to 3 years after the initiation of 
Humira. 
2) 
After discontinuation of HUMIRA, the presence or absence of malignant tumors, tuberculosis, 
serious infection, death, or other adverse events were collected using the Follow-up Questionnaire 
Form every 6 months to 3 years after the initiation of Humira

Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Of the 508 patients included in the safety analysis set, 3 patients were enrolled in the study as < 18 
years of age. One patient was enrolled with age of 15 years while two patients were 17 years at 
enrollment.  
Efficacy results 
Among the 3 patients enrolled in the study as < 18 years of age, one patient has been excluded from 
effectiveness analysis set. The following effectiveness results were reported for two subjects enrolled 
as < 18 yrs. Seventeen years old female patient reported DAS28-4(ESR) of 6.2 at baseline, 2.7 at 
week 4, 3.7 at week 12, and 4.3 at study discontinuation. The MHAQ result for this patient was 
reported as 1.6 at baseline and 0.8 at discontinuation. Fifteen years old female patient reported 
DAS28- 4(ESR) of 5.2 at baseline, 2.9 at week 4, 1.6 at year-1, 1.6 at year-1.5, 1.8 at Year-2, and 2.4 
at study discontinuation. 
Safety results 
Among the 3 patients enrolled in the study as < 18 years of age the following safety events were 
reported for 1 patient, a 15 years old female that developed nonserious event of skin eruption 
(urticarial) with causal relationship to study drug assessed as possible with the outcome reported as 
recovered, and non-serious event of eosinophil count increased with causal relationship assessed as 
possible and with outcome reported as recovered. 
1.2.3.  CHMP´s discussion on clinical aspects 
Study P12-070 was performed in an adult Japanese population, but due to diverging definitions of 
adults there were patients included in the study that according to the European definition are regarded 
as paediatrics.  
There were 3 paediatric patients included in the study. One of these experienced a non-serious event 
of urticaria and eosinophilia, with a possible causal relationship to the drug. The patient recovered. 
Due to the limited numbers of paediatric patients in the study, no firm conclusions can be drawn 
regarding efficacy and safety in the paediatric population. No information indicating any new safety 
issues has emerged. 
2.  CHMP’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
The presented data does not change the benefit risk for adalimumab in the paediatric approved 
indications. No changes are warranted in the SmPC. 
Recommendation  
No further action required.

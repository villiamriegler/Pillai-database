2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronically debilitating, autosomal recessive disease associated with serious 
morbidity and a high rate of premature mortality and at present, there is no cure. CF affects 
approximately 70,000 individuals worldwide, including approximately 30,000 individuals in the United 
States (US), 32,000 individuals in the European Union (EU), 4,000 individuals in Canada, and 3,100 
individuals in Australia. The incidence and prevalence of CF varies between racial groups; CF is 
considerably more common in the Caucasian populations of North America and Europe than in Asian and 
African populations.  
CF is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulatory (CFTR) gene that result in 
absence or deficient function of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. The CFTR protein is an epithelial 
chloride ion (CL-) channel located in the epithelia of multiple organs, including lungs, pancreas, intestinal 
tract, liver, and vas deferens, that is responsible for aiding in the regulation of salt and water absorption 
and secretion. CFTR mutations can be classified according to the mechanisms by which they disrupt CFTR 
function. Stop codon mutations (class I) result in a truncated nonfunctional CFTR, class II mutations 
consist of aberrantly folded CFTR protein that is degraded by the cell quality control system, while class 
III mutations lead to defective regulation of the CFTR protein and, consequently, the absence of CFTR 
function. These three classes usually lead to a classic CF phenotype with pancreatic insufficiency. CFTR 
mutations that lead to defective chloride conductance are grouped together in class IV. Class V mutations 
interfere with normal transcription, thereby reducing the amount of otherwise normal CFTR. These latter 
two classes are mostly associated with a milder expression of the disease. The most prevalent mutation 
is an in-frame deletion in the CFTR gene resulting in a loss of phenylalanine at position 508 in the CFTR 
protein (F508del-CFTR) and it is a Class II mutation: it prevents most of the CFTR protein from reaching 
the cell surface, resulting in little-to-no chloride transport. The decrease in the amount of F508del-CFTR 
at the cell surface is due to a defect in the processing and trafficking of the F508del-CFTR protein. The 
very small amount of F508del-CFTR protein that reaches the cell surface also has defective channel gating 
and a decreased stability at the cell surface. Patients who are homozygous with F508del-CFTR defects 
have little or no CFTR protein at the cell surface and hence suffer from a severe form of CF disease. The 
failure of the mutated CFTR to function properly in the lungs result in a cycle of mucus plugging, infection, 
and inflammation that leads to irreversible structural changes in the lungs and eventually respiratory 
failure, the most common cause of death for patients with CF. The predicted median age of survival of 
individuals born with CF today is approximately 40 years of age, while the median age at death is 
generally in the 20s.  
Lumacaftor has been clinically developed in combination with ivacaftor as a fixed dose combination (FDC) 
tablet for oral administration for the treatment of CF. Lumacaftor is a new active substance, while 
ivacaftor is a known active substance that is authorised for the treatment of CF in patients aged 6 years 
and older who have one of the following gating (class III) mutations in the CFTR gene: G551D, G1244E, 
G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, or S549R. 
Lumacaftor (LUM; VX-809) is a CFTR corrector and ivacaftor (IVA; VX-770; Kalydeco) is a CFTR 
potentiator. LUM acts on CFTR to facilitate the cellular processing and trafficking of CFTR, allowing the 
protein to reach the cell surface, where it exhibits improved chloride channel function compared to 
Assessment report  
EMA/686121/2018 
Page 7/104 
 
  
 
uncorrected F508del-CFTR. The channel gating activity of F508del-CFTR that has been delivered to the 
cell surface by LUM can be potentiated by IVA to further enhance chloride transport. The combination of 
a CFTR corrector and potentiator is a novel approach to enhance the amount and function of the defective 
CFTR protein in patients with CF who have the F508del-CFTR mutation. 
The proposed indication is the treatment of “cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients age 12 years and older who are 
homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene”. The proposed posology is two tablets of the 
fixed dose combination of lumacaftor 200mg/ivacaftor 125mg to be taken orally every 12 hours 
(lumacaftor 800mg/ivacaftor 500mg total daily dose).

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Lumacaftor 
General information 
The chemical name of lumacaftor is 
3-[6-({[1-(2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)cyclopropyl]carbonyl}amino)-3-methylpyridin-2-yl]benzoi
c acid and has the following structure: 
Molecular formula: C24H18F2N2O5   -   Molecular weight: 452.41 gmol-1 
Lumacaftor has a non-chiral molecular structure.  
Assessment report  
EMA/686121/2018 
Page 8/104 
 
  
 
 
 
The structure has been confirmed by elemental analysis, 1H-, 13C- and two dimensional NMR 
spectroscopy, IR, Raman and UV spectroscopy, high resolution mass spectrometry and crystallographic 
analysis. 
The active substance is a white to off-white non-hygroscopic crystalline solid. It is practically insoluble in 
water, buffer solutions with pH 1.0-8.0, simulated intestinal fluids and n-heptane, sparingly soluble in 
n-butanol and freely soluble in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran and formic acid.  
Multiple polymorphic forms have been identified for lumacaftor. Form I has been used in all lumacaftor 
clinical trials and was selected for the manufacture of the drug substance used in the commercial drug 
product. This is the form consistently produced by the proposed manufacturing process and it has been 
demonstrated that it is stable upon storage in both active substance and finished product under the 
proposed storage conditions. 
Since lumacaftor is considered a BCS class II, the drug substance was jet-milled early in development to 
reduce the particle size and potentially improve bioavailability. Based on these studies a control on 
lumacaftor particle size in the drug substance specification was established.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
A Quality by Design (QbD) strategy was pursued for the development of lumacaftor drug substance. 
Lumacaftor is synthesized in nine main steps including seven chemical transformations in a convergent 
synthesis, followed by recrystallization and milling, using commercially available well defined starting 
materials with acceptable specifications. There are different suppliers for each starting material. 
However, the same synthetic route is used by the different suppliers of the same starting material and 
starting materials comply with the same specifications regardless of the supplier. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
The critical quality attributes (CQAs) of lumacaftor are: appearance, identification, assay, organic 
impurities, inorganic impurities, residual solvents, physical form and particle size. As part of the enhanced 
approach to pharmaceutical development, the manufacturing process of lumacaftor was risk-assessed to 
identify those material attributes and process parameters affecting the CQAs. The control strategy for the 
starting materials, intermediates, drug substance and in-process controls were taken into account during 
the risk assessment. The results of this study indicated that all lumacaftor CQAs, except identification, are 
potentially impacted by the process. 
The manufacturing process has been developed using a combination of conventional univariate studies 
and design of experiment (DOE) studies. Based on these studies design spaces were developed for some 
steps of the synthesis. The design space verification and proposed lifecycle management have been 
discussed in detail and are based on a risk assessment of potential scale dependent phenomena for each 
step along with the control strategy (design space) demonstrated during development studies. The 
design spaces have therefore been verified for commercial scale. The available development data, the 
proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from commercial scale batches fully support the 
proposed design spaces. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Detailed studies on the potential and observed organic impurities in 
lumacaftor active substance originated from starting materials, the manufacturing process and 
degradation processes have been presented. The fate of these impurities has also been studied by spiking 
experiments and purging studies, demonstrating that their level is acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/686121/2018 
Page 9/104 
 
  
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the clinical 
development program. Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and have been 
justified. The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is considered 
to be comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process. 
Lumacaftor active substance is packaged inside a low density polyethylene (LDPE) bag secured with an 
appropriate closure, placed inside a second LDPE bag and secured appropriately. These closed LDPE bags 
are placed into a secondary container for storage and shipping. The LDPE is compliant with EU Regulation 
1183/2012, and the European Pharmacopoeia Monograph 3.1.3 “Polyolefins”. 
Specification 
The control strategy for lumacaftor consists of the specifications of the active substance starting 
materials, reagents and solvents, the active substance synthesis design spaces, the in-process controls 
and the active substance specification. 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance (visual inspection), identification (IR), 
physical form (XRPD), particle size (laser diffraction), assay (HPLC), organic impurities (HPLC), heavy 
metals (Ph. Eur.), sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.) and residual solvents (HS-GC). 
The omission of water content, formic acid and microbial testing from the active substance specification 
has been adequately justified. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and any non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.  
Batch analysis data on 10 pilot scale and 3 commercial scale batches of the active substance were 
provided. The results were within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on three pilot scale  batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in 
the intended commercial package for 12 months under long term conditions at 25 °C / 60% RH and for up 
to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided.  
The parameters tested were: appearance, assay, organic impurities, water content (KF), microbial limits 
and water activity.  
The stability data presented show that lumacaftor is stable when packaged in the intended container 
closure system under all storage conditions.  No trends or out of specification results were observed. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one pilot scale batch. Samples 
were tested for appearance, assay, organic impurities, physical form and water content. This study 
confirmed that lumacaftor is photostable and does not require light protective packaging. 
Forced degradation studies were also conducted on one batch. Stress conditions included exposure to 
heat, humidity, treatment under acidic, basic, neutral and oxidative conditions. Samples were tested for 
assay and organic impurities. Degradation was observed under basic and oxidative conditions. None of 
the degradation products observed under these stress conditions were found at or above the reporting 
threshold when the active substance was packaged and stored according to label instructions.  No 
degradation was observed when lumacaftor was exposed to any of the other stress conditions. The results 
from these studies confirmed the stability indicating nature of the proposed commercial HPLC method for 
assay and organic impurities. 
Assessment report  
EMA/686121/2018 
Page 10/104 
 
  
Overall, the stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The proposed re-test period for lumacaftor active substance of 24 months when stored 
in the intended container closure system at not more than 25°C with excursions to 30°C is supported by 
the data presented. 
Ivacaftor 
The information provided on ivacaftor in support of this MAA is in line with that provided for Kalydeco 
(EMEA/H/C/002494), approved in 2012.  
General information 
The chemical name of ivacaftor is 
N-(2,4-di-tert-butyl-5-hydroxyphenyl)-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxamide and has the following 
structure: 
Molecular formula: C24H28N2O3                            Molecular weight: 392.49 gmol-1 
Ivacaftor has a non-chiral molecular structure.  
The structure of ivacaftor has been confirmed by elemental analysis, 1H-, 13C- and two dimensional NMR 
spectroscopy, UV-Visible spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and crystallographic analysis. 
The active substance is a white to off-white crystalline slightly hygroscopic solid which is practically 
insoluble in water and buffers with pH 1.0-7.0, slightly soluble in ethanol, methanol and acetone and 
soluble in 2-methyl tetrahydrofuran.   
Multiple polymorphic forms have been identified for ivacaftor. The active substance produced by the 
proposed manufacturing process consists of a mixture of two major crystalline neat polymorphic forms, 
Form B and Form C. The control of the final isolation and drying conditions ensures that mixtures of the 
neat crystalline forms B and C are consistently produced. Nevertheless, the polymorphic form of ivacaftor 
during the synthesis of the active substance is not a CQA since during the manufacture of the drug 
product, ivacaftor is fully dissolved in a spray-drying solvent system to provide an amorphous 
intermediate, which is then converted to the final drug product. Therefore ivacaftor’s physical form is only 
a CQA for ivacaftor SDD (spray dried dispersion) and the final tablets, since it is critical to maintain the 
amorphous form to ensure bioavailability.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
A Quality by Design (QbD) approach was also used for the development of ivacaftor. The manufacturing 
process consists of four main steps using commercially available well defined starting materials with 
acceptable specifications. The synthetic routes for the starting materials have been described in detail 
and all potential related impurities or degradation products have been described and characterized. There 
are different suppliers for each starting material. However, the same synthetic route is used by the 
Assessment report  
EMA/686121/2018 
Page 11/104 
 
  
 
different suppliers of the same starting material. Description of the manufacturing process of the active 
substance including the in-process controls is adequate. 
A QbD approach has also been used in product and process development of ivacaftor. For the active 
substance synthesis, a combination of multivariate analyses and range-finding studies was used to define 
a design space for each step (namely, coupling, methanololysis, form conversion/crystallization and 
drying). All parameters with a potential impact on CQAs of the active substance were identified and 
thoroughly investigated. The applicant has proposed a combination of proven acceptable ranges (PARs) 
and design spaces for the manufacturing process of the active substance.  
Although  the  design  spaces  were  developed  at  small  laboratory  scales,  a  design  space  verification 
protocol providing demonstration of the risk of scale dependence of the parameters which define each 
design space was submitted. The robustness of the process has been confirmed with the manufacture of 
fifteen  large-scale  batches  of  ivacaftor  drug  substance,  which  have  consistently  met  the  acceptance 
criteria for all drug substance CQAs. The available development data, the proposed control strategy and 
batch analysis data from commercial scale batches fully support the proposed design spaces. 
Ivacaftor drug substance is packaged inside a low density polyethylene (LDPE) bag and secured with an 
appropriate  closure  (twist  tie  or  equivalent).  The  bag  is  then  placed  inside  a  second  LDPE  bag  and 
secured appropriately; the closed LDPE bags are placed into a secondary container suitable for storage 
and shipping. The LDPE is compliant with the Directive 2002/72/EC and the European Pharmacopoeia 
Monograph 3.1.3 “Polyolefins”. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual inspection), identification (FTIR), 
assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), acetamide (GC-MS), sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.), heavy metals 
(Ph. Eur.) and residual solvents (GC).  
A detailed study on the potential, theoretical and observed organic impurities has been presented. 
Impurity limits in the specification are justified and found safe. The limit proposed for acetamide 
(hydrolysis by-product of the process solvent acetonitrile) in the active substance has been established 
according to the Guideline on the Limits of Genotoxic Impurities.  
The limits set for specification parameters are acceptable and in line with batch results, stability studies 
and CHMP guidelines. Analytical methods used are sufficiently described and fully validated in line with 
the CHMP requirements.   
Results of analysis of sixteen commercial scale batches of the active substance were provided. 
Compliance with the specification was demonstrated.   
Stability 
Stability data on three pilot scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturers stored in 
the intended commercial package for 18 months under long term conditions at 30 °C / 65% RH and for up 
to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 °C / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided. This data were supplemented with long term stability data for up to 60 months during the 
evaluation procedure. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance, assay, related substances, water content, physical 
form, microbial limits and water activity. The analytical methods used were the same as for release, with 
the addition of XRPD for physical form determination, and were stability indicating. 
No trends in the assay or water content data were observed through 18 months of storage at 30 °C / 65% 
RH. Although a statistically significant trend was observed for these parameters on samples stored at 40 
°C / 75% RH through 6 months, all results remained well within the commercial specification acceptance

limit. The XRPD stability data show that ivacaftor remains crystalline at all test points under all storage 
conditions. In addition, data presented show no increase on water activity levels and no change in 
microbial content after storage for 12 months at 30 °C /6 5% RH. Thus, all tested parameters remained 
within the commercial specification acceptance limits.  
Ivacaftor active substance was also subjected to stress conditions including exposure to heat and heat 
combined with humidity for up to 21 days, treatment under acidic, basic, neutral and oxidative conditions 
for up to 14 days, exposure to pH 4 and pH 7 for up to 7 days and exposure to light conforming to ICH Q1B 
option 2 requirements. Ivacaftor was found to be the least stable under basic conditions and when in 
solution exposed to light. No degradation was observed when ivacaftor was exposed to the other stress 
conditions. Analysis of the stressed samples confirmed that the commercial HPLC method for assay and 
organic impurities determination in ivacaftor active substance is stability indicating. 
In addition, photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch.  The data, 
showing no changes in the fully exposed test sample and the covered control, confirm that ivacaftor drug 
substance is photostable and therefore does not require light protective packaging. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 30 months in the proposed 
container closure system. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Orkambi is a fixed dose combination (FDC) pink immediate-release film-coated tablet for oral 
administration containing 200 mg of lumacaftor and 125 mg of ivacaftor as active substances.  
Lumacaftor active substance is provided as a crystalline solid.  Ivacaftor active substance is provided as 
an amorphous SDD intermediate. This is due to the fact that, although ivacaftor is a stable crystalline 
material of high purity with well characterized physical and chemical properties, it is practically insoluble 
in aqueous media (< 0.05 μg/mL) and has low bioavailability. As a result, several approaches to obtain 
materials with better aqueous solubility were explored. Spray drying was selected as the preferred 
process to produce an ivacaftor solid dispersion with suitable properties for direct compression. 
Product and manufacturing process development was conducted under a QbD paradigm.    
The quality target product profile (QTPP) was to develop safe, efficacious and bioavailable 
immediate-release fixed-dose combination tablets containing 200 mg of lumacaftor and 125 mg of 
ivacaftor, suitable for oral administration, easily distinguishable from other medications consumed by the 
intended patient population, with a 24 month shelf-life at room temperature and packaged in blisters and 
with a posology of two tablets every 12 hours. 
Following the definition of the QTPP, the CQAs for the lumacaftor active substance, ivacaftor SDD and the 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor FDC tablet were identified. As described in section 1.1.2, the CQAs of lumacaftor 
drug substance are: appearance, identification, assay, organic impurities, inorganic impurities, particle 
size, residual solvents and physical form. The CQAs for ivacaftor SDD are: appearance, identification, 
assay, residual solvents, physical form, degradation products and water content. The CQAs for the FDC 
tablets are: appearance, identification, assay, physical form, degradation products, water content, 
dissolution, content uniformity and microbial attributes. 
Subsequently, as part of the QbD approach, an initial risk assessment was performed on the drug 
substance and the tablets to determine which materials and process steps could potentially impact the 
CQAs.  This risk assessment and prior knowledge were then used to design multivariate experiments to 
Assessment report  
EMA/686121/2018 
Page 13/104 
 
  
evaluate main effects and interactions and determine criticality.  Data from these studies were analysed 
to determine the design spaces that ensure all CQAs are within acceptance limits.  Once the design spaces 
were finalized, process models which describe them or which were used as part of the control strategy 
were finalized. 
The process knowledge gained throughout QbD development formed the basis of the overall product 
control strategies for the active substances and the finished product.  The control strategy includes 
control of input material attributes, critical process parameters, in-process controls, and product 
specifications.  
A rationale has been provided for the choice and level of each excipient, including the non-functional film 
coat and printing ink. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients. There are no novel 
excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the 
SmPC. The compendial excipients comply with the Ph. Eur requirements. Hypromellose acetate succinate 
(HPMCAS) complies with the USP/NF monograph and meets the requirements of the Ph. Eur. substances 
for pharmaceutical use and ICH Q3C requirements. Opadry II pink and Opacode black are 
non-compendial excipients mixtures wherein the individual components meet the appropriate 
requirements of the Ph. Eur. In view of the continuous manufacturing process, the excipients were risk 
assessed for potential impact on the drug product CQAs and information on the control of the excipients 
used, in addition to the pharmacopoeial requirements has been presented. This included a discussion on 
the need to implement functionality-related tests. Overall, the excipients and levels chosen for the 
commercial formulations demonstrate acceptable process characteristics and product performance 
across the design space.  
Several studies were also conducted to examine and demonstrate the chemical and physical compatibility 
of the lumacaftor drug substance and ivacaftor SDD with the tablet excipients as well as with each other. 
Since incompatibilities were not detected between the two drug substances, a mono-layer tablet 
formulation was developed. A conventional formulation development was conducted using well known 
excipients and standard manufacturing processes (wet granulation, compression and coating).  
Different lumacaftor/ivacaftor formulations have been used throughout the clinical development 
program. Initial clinical studies were conducted with lumacaftor only and included a lumacaftor oral water 
based suspension formulation used in early Phase 1 clinical studies and a lumacaftor capsule formulation 
used in subsequent Phase 1 and early Phase 2 studies.  Clinical development then moved to combination 
therapy and ivacaftor was added to the regimen.  Early Phase 1/2 clinical studies used individual 
lumacaftor and ivacaftor tablets. Later on, to enhance patient safety and compliance, a FDC tablet 
containing 200 mg lumacaftor and 125 mg ivacaftor as SDD was developed. A bioavailability study (Study 
007) was completed that supported the use of FDC tablets in Phase 3 clinical studies.  The Phase 3 pivotal 
studies included 2 dosing regimens and used both a lumacaftor/ivacaftor FDC tablet, 200/125 mg and a 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor FDC tablet, 200/83 mg.  Additionally, in the Phase 3 regimen that utilized the 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor FDC tablet, 200/83 mg, an individual ivacaftor, 125 mg tablet was also dosed. From 
these studies, the formulation selected for commercial use was the 200mg/125 mg FDC tablet. 
The final commercial FDC tablet formulation is identical to the 200 mg/125 tablets used in clinical trials 
with the exception of the printing in the film-coat, and the presence of traces of carnauba wax in tablets 
manufactured at one of the proposed manufacturing sites. It has been justified that the addition of the 
print or the presence of carnauba wax do not impact dissolution.  
Two independent in vitro dissolution methods, one for each active ingredient, were developed for testing 
the lumacaftor/ivacaftor FDC tablets. During the method development process, parameters were 
carefully selected to ensure that each method is discriminatory and suitable for its intended use.  Both 
dissolution methods have shown the ability to discriminate against meaningful manufacturing variations

and are considered suitable for their intended use as the primary release and stability quality control 
methods for lumacaftor/ivacaftor FDC tablets.   
The primary packaging is a blister consisting of PCTFE (polychlorotrifluoroethylene)/PVC (polyvinyl 
chloride) with a paper-backed aluminium foil lidding. The material complies with the current European 
Guideline on Plastic Immediate Packaging Materials (CPMP/QWP/4359/03), the Directive 2002/72/EC and 
Regulation No 10/2011 and/or the relevant European Pharmacopoeia Monograph. The choice of the 
container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the 
product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacture of Orkambi is a two-stage process. 
In the first stage, crystalline ivacaftor drug substance is dissolved with a polymer and a surfactant in the 
process solvents, then spray dried to form a powder, which undergoes secondary drying to further 
remove process solvents to acceptable limits.  This results in an amorphous spray-dried dispersion drug 
product intermediate (SDD) which is a free flowing, compressible powder.  
The second stage, which involves the manufacture of the FDC tablets, consists of seven steps: 
intra-granular blending, twin screw wet granulation, fluid bed drying and milling, extra-granular blending, 
compression, film coating, and printing.  
Three different manufacturing sites which use a continuous wet granulation process, but with slightly 
different systems and PAT capabilities, are proposed for the manufacture of the FDC tablets. One of the 
sites employs a twin screw granulator fed by a batch blend, followed by stand-alone batch fluid bed 
drying. The second site has a continuous tableting line which operates in a continuous mode from 
granulation to compression, with initial blending and film coating performed in batch mode. The third site 
uses a system which operates in continuous mode from individual components feeding to film-coated 
tablets and is enabled with real-time release testing (RTRT) capability.  
The impact of line rate was studied as part of the design space development experiments. The automatic 
adjustments the system requires are well within the design space limits of line rate. 
Spectroscopic and non-spectroscopic PAT are used for in-process controls. Spectroscopic and 
non-spectroscopic PAT measurements are implemented for real time release testing (RTRT) at one of the 
proposed manufacturing sites , as described under the product specification section. 
Design spaces have been proposed for the several steps of the manufacturing process of the SDD (spray 
drying) and the FDC tablets: intra-granular blending, blending, twin screw wet granulation, fluid bed 
drying and milling, extra-granular blending, compression, film coating, and printing.  
The design spaces have been developed at the commercial scale manufacturing equipment. Confirmation 
experiments to demonstrate the validity of the models developed were conducted. Therefore, the 
available development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from commercial scale 
batches fully support the proposed design spaces. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing 
process.  
Process validation of the ivacaftor SDD intermediate manufacturing process has been completed on three 
consecutive commercial scale batches.

EMA/686121/2018

For the manufacture of the FDC tablets, traditional process validation, in accordance with the CHMP 
Guideline on process validation for finished products (EMA/CHMP/QWP/BWP/70278/2012-Rev1), will be 
conducted at the three proposed manufacturing sites post-approval in line with the submitted process 
validation scheme. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form.  
For the manufacturing sites on which the finished product is released on the market through traditional 
final product release testing. They include: appearance (visual), identification (IR), assay (HPLC), 
dissolution (Ph. Eur.), water content (KF), uniformity of dosage units (HPLC), physical form of lumacaftor 
and ivacaftor (XRPD) and microbial limits (Ph. Eur.).  
For the manufacturing site on which real time release testing will be employed, the finished product 
specification includes: identification (Raman), assay (NIR on blend, core tablet weight), dissolution (high 
impact model), water content (NIR on blend), content uniformity (NIR on blend, core tablet weight), 
physical form (Raman) and microbial limits (Ph. Eur.). 
In line with the CHMP Guideline on Real Time Release Testing (EMA/CHMP/QWP/811210/2009-Rev1),  
the relationship between RTRT and end product testing and associated specification has been supported 
by comparative data at commercial scale (parallel testing), which will continue post-approval.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. The NIR and Raman methods proposed have been developed and validated in line 
with EMA’s guideline on the use of near infrared spectroscopy by the Pharmaceutical Industry and the 
data requirements for new submissions and variations (EMEA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/17760/2009 Rev2).  The 
quality profile of all reference materials has been correctly established.   
Development and validation of the high impact dissolution rate model for ivacaftor and lumacaftor have 
been adequately presented. The capability of the RTRT dissolution models to properly characterize 
dissolution performance of a batch has been demonstrated by the results obtained from the design space 
confirmation runs on that facility.  
The discriminatory power of the dissolution model has been demonstrated. 
Batch analysis results have been provided on three pilot and five commercial scale batches of ivacaftor 
SDD, and eleven pilot and three commercial scale batches of film-coated tablets manufactured at the 
proposed manufacturing sites. They confirm the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability 
to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data on one pilot scale and two commercial scale batches of ivacaftor SDD stored under long 
term conditions for 12 months (2 batches) or 24 months (1 batch) at 30 ºC / 65% RH and for up to six 
months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
The batches of ivacaftor SDD are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in primary 
packaging representative of the one proposed for marketing (single tied off LDPE bag within a heat-sealed 
foil laminate bag that contains a 5% w/w load of molecular sieve desiccant).  
Supporting stability data from three additional pilot scale batches stored for 18 months under long term 
conditions and for 6 months at accelerated conditions were also provided. 
Samples were tested for appearance, water content, assay, degradation products, physical form, 
microbial limits and water activity. 
Assessment report  
EMA/686121/2018 
Page 16/104 
 
  
The primary stability lots showed no changes over time for any of the attributes evaluated. The stability 
data from the supporting lots showed an increase in water content along with a corresponding decrease 
in assay for all storage conditions due to the samples being packaged without moisture protection (double 
polyethylene bags without desiccant and without an outer heat-sealed foil laminate bag). There were no 
other changes in the supporting stability lots under all storage conditions.  
Photostability testing as per ICH Q1B, Option 2, was performed on one of the supporting stability batches. 
The photostability data showed no changes in the fully exposed test sample and the covered control, and 
confirmed that ivacaftor SDD does not require light protective packaging. 
Based on available stability data, the expiry period for ivacaftor SDD of 24 months when stored in the 
proposed container closure system is acceptable. 
With regards to the finished product, stability data on three formal stability batches of 
lumacaftor/ivacactor FDC tablets 200/125 mg manufactured at each of the three proposed manufactured 
sites stored under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH or intermediate conditions at 30 ºC / 65% RH 
for up to 24 months were provided. Data from three batches from one site stored for six months under 
accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH were also submitted. The batches of lumcaftor/ivacaftor FDC 
tablets are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in primary packaging proposed for 
marketing.  
Samples were tested for appearance, assay, degradation products, dissolution, water content, physical 
form, microbial limits and water activity. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating 
All results met the acceptance criteria for all the attributes evaluated.  Although a small increase in water 
content was observed, it had no impact on the tablet physical and chemical properties. Additionally, a 
slowsdown in initial dissolution was observed, but it reached a plateau over time and all results met the 
specification limits. Overall, the stability data show that the drug product is stable when packaged in the 
configuration proposed for commercial distribution under all storage conditions. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. Samples were tested for appearance, assay and degradation 
products. The data showed no changes in the fully exposed test samples and the covered controls, 
demonstrating that the lumacaftor/ivacaftor tablets do not require light protective packaging. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life of 24 months without any storage requirements as stated 
in the SmPC are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substances and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner.  
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substances and finished product 
and their manufacturing processes. Design spaces have been proposed for several steps in the 
manufacture of the active substances and finished product. The design spaces have been adequately 
verified. 
Assessment report

The manufacture of the FDC tablets uses a continuous wet granulation process. Additional steps (e.g. 
intra-granular and extra-granular blending, granulation, drying, milling, compression, film-coating or 
printing) are also performed in a continuous mode in some of the proposed manufacturing sites.  
Following this QbD approach, a real time release testing strategy has been proposed for the site which 
operates in full continuous mode from individual components to film-coated tablets. 
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented 
to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene resulting in absent or deficient function of the 
CFTR protein at the cell surface. CFTR is an ATP-gated chloride channel located in the epithelia of a 
number of organs, including lung, pancreas, intestinal tract and liver, where it regulates salt and water 
absorption and secretion. Loss of chloride transport results in the accumulation of thick, sticky mucus on 
the bronchi of the lungs, loss of exocrine pancreatic function, impaired intestinal absorption and 
reproductive dysfunction. Lumacaftor, also known as VX-809 or VRT-826809, is an orally bioavailable 
small molecule CFTR corrector designed to work in combination with ivacaftor, a CFTR potentiator. 
Lumacaftor increases the amount of CFTR delivered to the cell surface, and ivacaftor increases the 
channel gating activity of the CFTR protein at the cell surface, thereby maximising CFTR-mediated Cl- 
secretion. 
The non-clinical data provided for the present application include in vitro pharmacodynamic studies 
performed with ivacaftor alone (the active substance included in Kalydeco approved by the CHMP in 2012, 
for which the applicant is the Marketing Authorisation Holder), with lumacaftor alone and with the FDC. No 
in vivo pharmacology studies were conducted. A comprehensive set of in vitro and in vivo safety 
pharmacology studies (rats and dogs), pharmacokinetics studies (rats, dogs and monkeys), and 
toxicology studies (mice, rats, rabbits and dogs) were conducted with ivacaftor and lumacaftor alone. 
Genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were not performed with 
the FDC as the studies conducted in these specific areas on each individual entity were considered 
adequate for assessment of the risk associated with co-administration. 
All safety pharmacology, toxicity, and toxicokinetic studies considered pivotal to safety assessment were 
conducted in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations with any exceptions duly noted 
and were conducted in Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care

Since the applicant is already the MAH for ivacaftor, some of the development studies of this FDC will be 
overlapping with the development of ivacaftor as monotherapy.

a An entry of "Yes" indicates that the study includes a GLP compliance statement. 
The in vitro pharmacological studies conducted by the applicant show that the mechanism of action of 
lumacaftor appears to be through facilitation of the cellular processing and trafficking of ΔF508-CFTR by 
partially  correcting  the  molecular  defect  of  ΔF508-CFTR.  This  leads  to  an  increase  in  the  amount  of 
functional  CFTR  protein  at  the  cell  surface,  and  subsequent  increased  chloride  transport.  The  gating 
activity of this ‘corrected’ ΔF508-CFTR at the cell surface can then be further potentiated by ivacaftor to 
enhance chloride transport, thus supporting the rationale for the co-treatment approach. 
No in vivo pharmacodynamic studies were performed with lumacaftor as no validated CF animal models 
are  available.  Instead,  cultured  primary  human  bronchial  epithelial  (HBE)  cells  from  patients  with  CF 
(expressing ΔF508-CFTR) were used to test the mechanism of action of lumacaftor and support its use in 
combination with ivacaftor for the intended therapeutic indication. This model is considered appropriate 
since CF HBE cells exhibit typical characteristics associated with CF lung pathogenesis, including defects 
in ion and fluid transport. In ΔF508-CFTR HBE cells, lumacaftor treatment increased chloride transport 
from a baseline of 3.4% to 13.9% of wild-type CFTR levels, with an EC50 of 81±19 nM. When ivacaftor was 
added to lumacaftor-treated cells, chloride transport was further enhanced to 25.1% of wild-type CFTR 
levels.  Treatment  with  lumacaftor  was  required  for  at  least  24  hours  prior  to  chloride  secretion 
measurements,  in  order  to  allow  for  de  novo  synthesis,  processing  and  trafficking  of  ‘corrected’ 
ΔF508-CFTR  to  the  cell  surface.  In  support  of  this,  little-to  no  response  was  observed  on  chloride 
transport following ivacaftor treatment in the absence of lumacaftor in HBE cells expressing ΔF508-CFTR. 
The  physiological  relevance  of  lumacaftor  and  ivacaftor-mediated  correction  of  chloride transport  was 
demonstrated in HBE cultures by the increase in airway surface liquid height and ciliary beat frequency, 
showing  a  normalisation  of  fluid  secretion,  and  thus  potentially  a  therapeutic  benefit  on  mucociliary 
clearance in cystic fibrosis patients. 
Lumacaftor  was  shown  to  bind  to  the  MSD1  region  of  CFTR,  and  facilitate  the  correct  folding  of 
ΔF508-CFTR during its biogenesis in the ER. A truncated form of ΔF508-CFTR containing only the MSD1 
domain was less susceptible to proteolytic digestion following treatment with lumacaftor, suggesting that 
CFTR was in a more stable and compact folded form. Lumacaftor increased the efficiency of ΔF508-CFTR 
export from the ER, and cell surface stability of lumacaftor-corrected ΔF508-CFTR was also shown to be 
improved,  suggesting  a  reduced  susceptibility  to  lysosomal  degradation.  Patch-clamp  experiments 
confirmed that lumacaftor alone or in combination with ivacaftor increased the channel open probability 
(up  to  111±21%  of  normal  CFTR  when  in  combination  with  ivacaftor)  compared  to  uncorrected 
ΔF508-CFTR. Given that the gating activity of lumacaftor-corrected CFTR is approximately 50% of normal 
CFTR, it does not appear that lumacaftor completely restores normal protein function. 
Recent  published  evidence  from  two  separate  academic  groups  suggested  that  prolonged  ivacaftor 
treatment (24-48 hours in primary human bronchial epithelial cells) may adversely affect the function of 
lumacaftor-corrected Δ508-CFTR, by diminishing the folding efficacy and metabolic stability, ultimately 
resulting in significantly reduced functional expression at the cell surface (Cholon et al, Sci Transl Med 
6(246)  2014  and  Veit  et  al  Sci  Transl  Med  6(246)  2014).  These  in  vitro  data  indicate  that  chronic 
Assessment report

treatment  with  ivacaftor  may  be  detrimental  for  the  restoration  of  Δ508-CFTR  function,  and  raises 
questions regarding the proposed benefits of the ivacaftor/lumacaftor combination. It is noted that the 
definition of ‘chronic’ in the in vitro setting in these published studies is no longer than 48 hours. The 
relevance  of  this  time  point,  particularly  in  the  light  of  the  demonstrated  clinical  efficacy  (although 
modest) over much longer duration, is questionable. After extensive review of these data a clinical impact 
on the pharmacological mechanism of action of the ivacaftor/lumacaftor combination is considered not 
being likely.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies  
Lumacaftor was highly selective when tested in a panel of 168 in vitro receptor, channel and enzyme 
radioligand assays. Only relatively weak antagonism (reversal of TXA2 agonist-induced contractile 
response in rat aortic rings) was demonstrated at the TXA2 receptor. In addition, lumacaftor was highly 
selective against correction of CFTR trafficking relative to a range of other misfolded and wild-type 
proteins. Lumacaftor was not considered to be a hERG channel blocker, since the maximum soluble 
concentration (4.6 μM) inhibited hERG potassium current by only 0.2±0.2%, which was not statistically 
significant compared to controls.  
With respect to ivacaftor secondary and safety pharmacology, only two targets were inhibited with 
nanomolar potency out of 140 enzymes and receptors tested: the monoamine transporter and serotonin 
5-HT2C. However, due to low blood-brain-penetration, ivacaftor is unlikely to interact with these CNS 
targets in humans. In addition, ivacaftor inhibited only CaV1.2 (IC50 = 1.3 μM) and KV1.5 (IC50 = 3.4 μM) 
channels with moderate potency. Ivacaftor caused hERG inhibition with an IC15 of 5.5 µM, and was 
therefore not considered a potent hERG inhibitor. Any risk of off-target effects from ivacaftor in humans 
at therapeutic dose levels and exposures is minimal, since ivacaftor is highly plasma protein bound across 
all species, and the free plasma concentration at therapeutic dose will be low (approximately 4 nM). 
Finally, ivacaftor produced an inhibition of gastric emptying and gastrointestinal transit in male rats at 
high doses (≥500 mg/kg). However, no adverse effects on the GI system were noted in repeat dose 
toxicity studies in rats and dogs. 
Based on the highly selective nature of lumacaftor in the secondary and safety pharmacology studies, any 
detrimental pharmacodynamics drug interaction with ivacaftor does not seem likely. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
In safety pharmacology studies, lumacaftor did not produce any effects on the CNS and respiratory 
systems in rats at single oral doses of up to 1000 mg/kg.  In addition, lumacaftor had no effect on gastric 
motility when tested up to 1000 mg/kg in rats. There were no effects of lumacaftor on cardiovascular 
(blood pressure, heart rate and ECG) parameters in dogs, when tested up to 200 mg/kg, also confirming 
the absence of a physiological translation of the TXA2 receptor antagonistic effect. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
In vitro pharmacodynamic interaction studies of lumacaftor and ivacaftor were conducted earlier. These 
studies support the proposed combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor, with lumacaftor partially 
correcting the molecular defect of ΔF508-CFTR to increase the amount of functional ΔF508-CFTR at the 
cell surface, with ivacaftor further enhancing the chloride transport of the cell surface ΔF508-CFTR. The 
justification for the therapeutic combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor based in the presented 
pharmacodynamic studies is considered adequate to the CHMP.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption of lumacaftor and ivacaftor in mice, rats, rabbits and dogs was rapid, and bioavailability 
ranged from 30% to 100%. The apparent permeability of lumacaftor and ivacaftor in Caco-2 cell 
monolayer is high, which may have contributed to a high oral bioavailability. Neither lumacaftor nor 
ivacaftor were substrates for the efflux transporter P-gp. 
Lumacaftor is considered a highly permeable compound, and this finding is confirmed by results from two 
studies performed under the same experimental condition and with the same concentration of 10 µM.  
Systemic exposures to lumacaftor and ivacaftor in combination studies in rats and dogs were largely 
similar to the exposures achieved when the compounds were dosed individually. However, in rats when 
comparing the 28-day toxicity study conducted with lumacaftor alone, lumacaftor exposure in the 300 
and 1000 mg/kg dose groups included in both studies was generally higher (>2-fold) in the combination 
toxicity study in both sexes. In addition, lumacaftor exposure in male rats in the 3 month combination 
toxicity study also appeared higher than in the 3 month study with lumacaftor alone. The applicant 
considered that any differences in lumacaftor exposure were likely a result from inherent variation across 
studies. Besides, pharmacokinetic studies in rats confirmed the absence of interaction between 
lumacaftor and ivacaftor. A dose-proportional increase in exposure was observed when lumacaftor and 
ivacaftor were dosed at lower doses. However, at higher doses including those explored in toxicity 
studies, exposure was generally less than dose proportional. No significant gender differences were 
observed; no evidence of accumulation of lumacaftor after repeated exposure was seen. Ivacaftor 
exposures were higher at steady-state compared to single dose exposures. 
Protein binding of lumacaftor and ivacaftor is high (>98%) in mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, and human plasma 
and primarily bound to HSA in isolated human plasma protein components. Both lumacaftor and ivacaftor 
were rapidly distributed across most tissues in rats. Gastrointestinal (GI) tissues showed highest 
exposure, followed by liver and kidney. Lowest exposures were noted in the brain, eyes and testes. 
Neither lumacaftor nor ivacaftor binds to melanin containing tissues (skin and/or eyes). Placental transfer 
of lumacaftor was confirmed in rats and rabbits, whith low levels of radioactivity detected across a range 
of foetal tissues. For ivacaftor, placental transfer was limited. In vitro studies demonstrated that warfarin 
was able to displace lumacaftor from plasma protein binding to a small degree, increasing the fraction of 
unbound lumacaftor from 0.05% to 0.1%, suggesting a potential for plasma protein binding-related 
drug-drug interactions. However, this small change in fraction unbound was not considered to influence 
clinical exposure. 
Lumacaftor metabolism primarily involved oxidation (M1) and/or glucuronidation (M2), but the majority 
of lumacaftor was excreted unchanged. M28-lumacaftor was a major human metabolite after single 
doses, and was not detected in non-clinical species. However, after repeated doses humans, 
M28-lumacaftor accounted for less than 10% of parent, and was therefore considered to be a minor 
human disproportionate metabolite. M22-lumacaftor was a major excretory metabolite of lumacaftor. The 
M28-lumacaftor metabolite was stated to be pharmacologically inactive. The major ivacaftor metabolism 
pathway was oxidation to M1- and M6-ivacaftor, and only a small proportion was excreted as unchanged 
parent. M1-ivacaftor had a much lower (1/6th) pharmacological potency than ivacaftor, and M6-ivacaftor 
was pharmacologically inactive. Lumacaftor and ivacaftor are both substrates of CYP3A4; however, 
sensitivity to CYP3A4 metabolism was much greater for ivacaftor than lumacaftor. Lumacaftor also 
activates PXR, which may cause downstream effect on induction of PXR-dependent CYP enzymes, 
including CYP3A4. Neither lumacaftor nor ivacaftor are substrates for uptake transporters OATP1B1 and 
OATP1B3.  
Based on in vitro studies, lumacaftor and ivacaftor both have potential to inhibit P-gp, but not expected 
to inhibit OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. The effect of lumacaftor and ivacaftor on other transporters (including 
Assessment report  
EMA/686121/2018 
Page 22/104 
 
  
OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, OCT1, BCRP or BSEP) was not initially described. The Applicant will conduct studies 
to evaluate the inhibition of BCRP, but considered that evaluation of BSEP was not necessary, due to the 
absence of data suggesting reduced bile salt secretion and cholestasis. In addition, due to the low renal 
clearance of lumacaftor, the Applicant considered that evaluation of OAT and OCT was not necessary. 
However, this was not accepted by the CHMP, and the Applicant agreed to evaluate potential inhibition of 
OAT1, OAT3, OCT1 and OCT2 as a post-authorisation measure.  
Faecal  and  biliary  excretion  was  the  primary  route  of  elimination  for  both  lumacaftor  and  ivacaftor. 
Lumacaftor  was  excreted  primarily  as  unchanged  parent;  whereas,  ivacaftor  was  eliminated  as  polar 
oxidative  metabolites.  Since  lumacaftor  is  eliminated  predominantly  unchanged  in  the  faeces,  biliary 
secretion by transporters may be involved, and these should be identified and possible polymorphisms 
considered. The Applicant has agreed to complete studies to evaluate whether lumacaftor is a substrate 
for BCRP and MRP2 as a post-authorisation measure. Both lumacaftor and ivacaftor were excreted in the 
milk of lactating rats. 
In summary, the CHMP concluded that the in vitro studies suggest that lumacaftor and ivacaftor and 
M1-ivacaftor may have pharmacokinetic interactions with other drugs that are CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP3A or P-gp substrates. These potential interactions are adequately described in the SmPC. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicology programme of LUM/IVA FDC has been performed according to the ICH/CHMP relevant 
guidelines and was supported by studies: i) conducted with lumacaftor and its minor but disproportionate 
and pharmacologically inactive human metabolite M28 (evaluated independently); ii) conducted with 
ivacaftor taking into account its major circulating metabolites in all species studied i.e. M1 metabolite 
(1/6th of the potency of ivacaftor) and M6 metabolite (pharmacologically inactive); iii) conducted with the 
combination LUM/IVA.  
In all studies, the products were administered by oral (gavage) route, which is intended for human use. 
All pivotal studies were in compliance with GLP regulations. Based on the primary pharmacology of 
lumacaftor and ivacaftor, rats and dogs were selected as relevant species for the toxicological assessment 
of the drug. 
Single dose toxicity 
Single-dose studies conducted in mice and rats up to 2000 mg/kg suggest that the acute oral toxicity of 
lumacaftor is of low order. In mice, the MTD and NOAEL were ≥ 2000 mg/kg, in rats both the NOAEL and 
NOEL were 1000 mg/kg, and the MTD in rats was ≥ 2000 mg/kg, based on 100% survival rate. 
Dose-based safety margins relative to the intended human therapeutic dose of lumacaftor in the FDC 
(800 mg total daily) were 10 and 20-fold higher (for mice and rats, respectively) at the MTD, based on the 
surface-area extrapolation method and assuming a 50 kg human body weight. The ivacaftor MTD were 
2000 mg/kg in mice and 500 mg/kg in rats. Dose-based safety margins relative to the intended human 
therapeutic dose of ivacaftor in the FDC (500 mg total daily) were 8- and 16-fold higher in rats and mice 
respectively at the MTD, based on the surface-area extrapolation method and assuming a 50 kg human 
body weight.  
The lack of LUM/IVA combination single-dose oral toxicity studies is acceptable to the CHMP, since the 
studies conducted for each product showed no evidence of potential for additive or synergistic interaction 
and are adequate to assess the acute toxicity safety risk associated with co-administration. Additional in 
vivo studies are not needed or justified.

Repeat dose toxicity 
Lumacaftor repeat dose toxicity in mice was evaluated in two studies of 4-week duration (Tg.rasH2 
mice;VX-809-TX023) and 13-week duration (CD 1 mice; VX-809-TX015). In Tg.rasH2 mice, the MTD was 
4000 mg/kg/day based on mortality and significant effects on body weight and body weight gain. This 
dose produced high systemic exposure, as evidenced by steady state AUC 0-24h value of 2260 µg.h/mL 
in males, which is 5.7-fold greater than that observed in humans with administration of LUM 800 mg/day 
(396 µg.h/mL). In CD1 mice the MTD was 2000 mg/kg/day based on mortality. This dose produced a 
systemic exposure (AUC 0-24h 2490 µg.h/mL in males) - 5.9-fold greater than that observed in humans 
with the lumacaftor dose of the FDC.  
In the 13-week study in rats, the lumacaftor NOAEL is 2000 mg/kg/day. Liver, spleen and thymus organ 
weights (absolute and/or relative organ weight changes, irreversible for tyhymus) were increased at 2000 
mg/kg/day, and microscopic treatment-related findings were present in the liver (centrilobular 
hypertrophy) and spleen (increased extramedullary hematopoiesis). The applicant considered these 
findings not to be adverse under the conditions of this study, considering liver alterations as adaptive 
phenomena, spleen increases as secondary to haematological changes and irreversible thymus weight 
decreased as stress-related and/or due to body weight loss. These justifications are acceptable to the 
CHMP, taking into account that these findings were observed after 26 week duration treatment up to 
1000/25 mg/kg/day of LUM/M28LUM, suggesting an adaption to the LUM administration in rats.  
In dogs, the observed effects, although similar to those seen in rats, appeared to be more frequent and 
intense. The main concern relates to findings observed in 13 week duration study in one male showing 
hematopoietic cellularity of the bone marrow moderate in the sternum and marked in the femur that could 
indicate potential detrimental effects on bone marrow. Moreover, in all dog studies, the decreases in 
haemoglobin, haematocrit and red blood cells (seen in both genders at almost all doses) were not 
associated with an increase in the number of reticulocytes, suggesting an inadequate response to the 
bone marrow, conversely to what happened in the rat, in which decreases in erythrocytic parameters 
appear regenerative. However, it is recognised that the bone marrow effects were observed at doses 
higher than the MTD. The decreased cellularity of the bone marrow was fully reverted after the one 
month-recovery period, furthermore, these findings do not appear to translate into the clinical setting as 
no significant effects on erythrocytic parameters were demonstrated in the Phase 3 study. Based on bone 
marrow finding besides mortality, clinical signs and significant body weight decrement with the 
lumacaftor dose of 1000 mg/kg/day exceeded the MTD in this species after 13 week duration treatment; 
therefore the NOAEL is considered 500 mg/kg/day.  
In 26-52 week duration studies, dose-related increase in absolute (up to 24%) and relative liver weights 
in females at ≥ 125 mg/kg/day and in males at ≥ 250 mg/kg/day were induced after 12 months 
treatments. This correlates with ALT increase at dose ≥250 mg/kg/day, without any macroscopic or 
microscopic findings and fully reversible. The NOAEL is considered to bw 500 mg/kg, corresponding to the 
exposure at the steady state of AUC0-24hr 515/429 μg.hr/mL (M/F) and Cmax 61.3/ 56.0 μg/mL (M/F). 
With regards to the thymus alterations, it is recognised that thymus undergoes involution characterised 
by decrease in cellularity, depending on diet, age, sex, strain and species of animals being tested. Thymus 
involution is difficult to differentiate by thymus atrophy induced by inadequate nutrition, stress, or toxicity 
(Pearse, 2006). The histological appearance of the thymus under these varied conditions is similar, since 
the endpoint is the reduction in cortical lymphocytes, and shrinkage of the thymus lobules (Schuurman et 
al., 1994), and factors such as stress and toxicity can simultaneously be superimposed on the normal 
ageing process of lymphocyte reduction. On these bases, the applicant’s opinion that the lymphoid 
depletion was at least partially due to an indirect effect, secondary to stress and/or weight loss is 
scientifically sustained.  
Assessment report  
EMA/686121/2018 
Page 24/104 
 
  
The LUM/IVA co-administration in dogs for 4 weeks induced a decrease in thymus weights (-37, 59, 58 
and 51% in males; -28, 29, 43 and 48% in females for doses > 300/ 5mg/kg/day LUM/IVA) and enhance 
lymphoid depletion as compared to controls. This is also associated with a lympahocyte and eosinophil 
reduction starting from a dose higher than 300/15 mg/kg/day LUM/IVA. Since no thymus findings are 
raised during assessment for ivacaftor MAA (filed and owned by the same applicant), data obtained from 
co-administration studies suggest that the exacerbation of thymus involution may be due to LUM only. In 
addition, 6 month carcinogenicity study in Tg.rasH2 mice showed that 2 out of 50 mice developed 
thymomas. In light of this, the Applicant has thoroughly reviewed the available data on thymus 
alterations and further corroborated that the correlation between stress response and the concurrent 
thymus changes is consistent with guidance for identifying stress responses in routine toxicology studies, 
as issued by the Society for Toxicologic Pathology Regulatory Policy Committee. Moreover, the lack of 
effects on other lymphoid tissues does not suggest a primary effect on the immune system. 
Ivacaftor target organs in rat and dog chronic toxicity studies were liver, kidney and heart. 
Hepatotoxicity, cardiomyopathy and nephropathy in rats are considered mainly rodent-specific 
phenomena. Microscopic changes associated with co-administration of lumacaftor and ivacaftor were 
present in glandular stomach, duodenum and kidneys in rats, and gallbladder and reproductive system in 
dogs. Erosion of the mucosa of the glandular stomach, graded minimal to moderate without significant 
inflammatory response, was observed in 4/10 animals and 14/80 animals dosed with LUM/IVA or 
LUM/IVA/M28LUM respectively for 4 and 13 week. Kidney basophilic and dilated tubules in rats 
administered LUM/IVA or LUM/IVA/M28LUM were observed mainly in males at the highest combination 
dose (LUM/IVA 1000/100 or IVA/LUM/M28LUM 100/1000/20mg/kg/day). The applicant attributed these 
effects to a non-adverse potential test article exacerbation of chronic progressive nephropathy (CPN), a 
known age-related, background kidney finding in rats, with higher incidence and severity seen in males 
than females. This hypothesis is considered reasonable and it is supported by literature (Hard and Nasir 
Khan, 2004). The effects were not observed after administration of LUM, but were already observed for 
IVA alone at doses > 50 mg/kg in chronic (6 months) study in rats, involved also rodent specific 
mechanism (Kalydecdo EPAR). Therefore, these could be considered class effects of the test articles, and 
seem confirmed by the observed degenerative /regenerative kidney tubular lesions observed in TgH2 6 
month carcinogenicity study. Since the mechanism underlying the spontaneous disease process remains 
unknown, it would be more appropriate to consider the potential LUM/IVA exacerbation effects an AE of 
treatment. Hence, the LUM/IVA NOAEL co-administration in 4 week duration rat study were 1000/50 
mg/kg/day and the IVA/LUM/M28LUM NOAEL co-administration rat in 13 week duration study 25/500/10 
mg/kg/day.  
The changes in bodyweight/bodyweight gain, the hematologic and clinical chemistry observations caused 
by lumacaftor were generally transient and of small entity and are of doubtful or minimal toxicological 
importance. Changes in organ weights seem not to be an index of organ dysfunction: liver alterations are 
adaptive responses not considered toxicologically relevant and spleen increases are reasonably due to 
secondary haematological changes and to spontaneous chronic progressive neuropathy. In summary, 
liver, spleen and gastrointestinal system alterations are mainly due to spontaneous exacerbations in 
rodent following LUM/IVA co-adminsitration. Therefore, under experimental conditions, lumacaftor 
administered up to 13, 26 and 52 weeks in mice, rats and dogs, respectively,  failed to identify target 
organ of toxicity, although definitive conclusion on this issue could be drawn only after the assessment of 
the ongoing two year rat carcinogenicity study. The NOAEL in mice, rats and dogs treated for 13, 26 and 
52 week are 1000, 1000 and 500 mg/kg, respectively.  
Overall, the combination of LUM/IVA did not affect the pharmacokinetics of each compounds; in rats and 
dogs, systemic exposures to lumacaftor and ivacaftor were generally similar to those seen after 
combination of each compound,exception given for IVA which showed accumulation. No new toxicities 
were revealed. In addition, the ivacaftor NOAEL in rats and dogs was reduced when combined with 
Assessment report  
EMA/686121/2018 
Page 25/104 
 
  
lumacaftor as compared to ivacaftor alone, reflecting a greater sensitivity to ivacaftor in the presence of 
lumacaftor. 
At the observed NOAEL, multiple exposures were reached for the majority of the studies, which would 
give a reasonable safety margin for most of the toxicity findings observed. Only for the M6IVA, the 
ivacaftor metabolite considered to be inactive, no safety margins were calculated in all studies. Toxicity of 
ivacaftor metabolites was individually not evaluated because the applicant considered M1-ivacaftor 
exposures at NOAEL in male rats to be high enough to provide adequate toxicology reassurance to 
extrapolate to human exposure.  
Genotoxicity 
Lumacaftor was non-genotoxic in a test battery comprehending the following assays: Ames test, CHO 
cells and in vivo micronucleous test. Since no toxico-kinetic investigation was included in the study, the 
evidence of exposure is claimed by the applicant because clinical signs of toxicity, characterised by 
piloerection in male mice at LUM 500, 1000 and 2000 mg/kg and lethargy in males at 2000 mg/kg, were 
observed in male mice. Ivacaftor was non-mutagenic and non-clastogenic in the ICH standard battery of 
genotoxicity tests. Since M1 and M6 are produced in vitro in animal liver preparations, it is highly likely 
that these ivacaftor metabolites are also non-mutagenic and non-clastogenic in vitro. Combination 
genotoxicity studies involving the co-administration of LUM and IVA were not performed and not 
considered necessary, since data available on each individual entity appear adequate for hazard 
identification and assessment of the genetic toxicity risk associated with co-administration.  
Carcinogenicity 
The lumacaftor lifetime (2-year) rat carcinogenicity study was ongoing at the time of this submission. The 
rat study design also includes an evaluation of a minor, yet disproportionate human metabolite of 
lumacaftor, M28-lumacaftor, which is formed at very low levels in mice and rats. The study design is 
claimed by the applicant agreed to by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Ivacaftor was not 
carcinogenic in mice and rats at the highest dosages tested (200 mg/kg/day in mice, corresponding to the 
AUC0-24h of 112 and 203 µg.h/mL in M and F respectively, and 50 mg/kg/day in rats, corresponding to 
the AUC0-24h  of 467 and 853 µg.h/mL in M and F respectively). These exposures are in mice 5xM and 
27xF the human exposure, and in rats 63xM and 116xF the human exposure. In addition, no 
pre-neoplastic lesions were seen in the mouse 3-month carcinogenicity dose range finding study, in the 
rat sub-chronic (3-month) and chronic (6-month) toxicity studies, or in the dog subchronic (3-month) and 
chronic (12-month) studies, suggesting a low potential for ivacaftor-induced tumour promotion. In the 
short term study (six month mice TgH2 carcinogenicity study), lumacaftor did not increase the incidence 
of neoplastic lesions. The tumor induced by LUM are among the most common spontaneous neoplasms in 
untreated Tg rasH2 mice (Morton et al., 2002), and not significant difference in the incidence between 
treated and controls are observed. Kidneys are the target organ for non-neoplastic lesions only in male 
mice, due to the presence of degenerative and regenerative changes. Since the M28LUM human 
circulating metabolites were not identified in Tg.rasH2 mice plasma, safety of the M28 human circulating 
metabolites of lumacaftor cannot appropriately assessed in this carcinogenicity studies, but this will be 
possible on the basis of findings of the ongoing two year rat carcinogenicity study, performed 
administering  lumacafor and M28LUM metabolite . 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Lumacaftor/M28LUM does not affect male or female reproductive functions, as demonstrated in the rat 
fertility and early developmental study. Lumacaftor/M28-LUM did not cause reproductive system toxicity 
in male and female rats at 1000/20 mg/kg/day, respectively. 
Ivacaftor did not cause reproductive system toxicity in male and female rats at 200 and 100 mg/kg/day, 
respectively. Dosages above of 100 mg/kg/day in females were associated to a 54% reduction in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/686121/2018 
Page 26/104 
 
  
overall fertility index and number of pregnancies, significant reductions in the average number of corpora 
lutea and implantation sites with subsequent reductions in the average litter size and the average number 
of viable embryos per litter. Weight decreases of the seminal vesicles were observed in males treated at 
200 mg/kg/day.  
Lumacaftor was not teratogenic dosed orally to pregnant rats and rabbits during the organogenesis stage 
of foetal development at 2000 and 200 mg/kg/day (the highest dosage tested, corresponding to AUC 
0-24h of 3320 µg.h/mL at GD 16 in rats and 1950 µg.h/mL at GD 19 in rabbits). The exposure at these 
doses is approximately 8x (rats) and 5x (rabbit) the mean systemic exposures of LUM in CF patients. In 
rabbits dosages > 50 mg/kg/day (AUC 995 µg.h/mL) produced maternal toxicity and abortion. 
M28-LUM induced (see other studies section) foetal malformations and developmental variations only at 
extremely high maternal toxic doses, commonly inducing foetal alterations (800 mg/kg/day 
corresponding to AUC 0-24h of 4240 µg.h/mL at GD 16, approximately 120x the mean systemic 
exposures of M28-LUM in CF patients). On this basis M28-LUM is not consider teratogen. 
Ivacaftor was not teratogenic administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits during the organogenesis 
stage of foetal development at 100 and more than 100 mg/kg/day (the highest dosage tested), 
respectively. The exposure of both doses is approximately 45x the mean systemic exposures to ivacaftor 
in CF patients. In rats, dosages above 100 mg/kg/day produced reductions of foetal body weight and the 
the following skeletal development malformations: cervical ribs, incompletely ossified ribs, wavy ribs and 
sternal irregularities. These malformations are commonly observed at maternal toxic doses, so they were 
not considered teratogenic. 
Lumacaftor/M28-LUM did not cause developmental defects in the offspring of pregnant rats dosed orally 
from pregnancy through parturition and weaning at 1000/20 mg/kg/day. This corresponds to an 
exposure, in term of AUC 0-24h at DG 16, of about 2500 µg.h/mL, approximately 6x the mean systemic 
exposures of IVA in CF patients. F1 generation pups were indirectly exposed to LUM and M28-LUM 
through maternal transmission, during maternal gestation in utero and via maternal milk during the 
lactation period. Ivacaftor did not cause developmental defects in the offspring of pregnant rats dosed 
orally from pregnancy through parturition and weaning at 100 mg/kg/day. Dosages higher than 100 
mg/kg/day, were associated with reduction in survival and in lactation indices (92 and 98%, respectively) 
and in pup body weight. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies with LUM/IVA co-administration have not been 
performed since studies, conducted on each individual entity, were considered adequate to assess the risk 
associated with co-administration and provided no evidence for potential additive or synergistic 
interaction. Based on the available data, the overall reproductive and developmental risk associated with 
the combination regimen can be considered low. Juvenile animals studies are currently not required as 
the proposed LUM/IVA FDC indication target CF patients 12 years of age and older.  
Toxicokinetic data 
A comparison of steady-state exposures of lumacaftor/ivacaftor and their respective metabolites in 
nonclinical and clinical studies is provided in the table below. Human exposure is based on the proposed 
combination regimen of daily doses of 800 mg lumacaftor and 500 mg ivacaftor resulting in mean 
systemic exposures (AUC0-24h) in CF patients of 396 and 7.32 µg·h/mL respectively. At these doses, 
AUC0-24h of the lumacaftor metabolite, M28, is 33 µg·h/mL, and AUC0-24h of the ivacaftor metabolites, M1 
and M6 are 24.2 and 49.6 µg·h/mL respectively.

Comparison of lumacaftor and M28-lumcaftor exposure in non-clinical studies to clinical studies 
The Applicant considered M28-lumacaftor a minor, human-specific metabolite, based on exposure in 
repeat dose clinical studies. M28-lumacaftor has been extensively characterised toxicologically, and can 
be therefore also considered to be adequately qualified as a major metabolite. M28-lumcaftor was not 
genotoxic, and did not result in target organ toxicity following repeat administration in rats. Fetal 
malformations were present in rats at doses where significant maternal toxicity was also present. 
M28-lumacaftor exposure at the NOAEL for developmental toxicity of 400 mg/kg was 101 fold higher than 
exposure at the maximum recommended human dose, indicating that this metabolite does not present a 
risk to humans. No separate toxicity studies with metabolites of ivacaftor were conducted as the exposure 
of M1-ivacaftor in rats was considered high enough at the NOAEL to provide adequate toxicology cover at 
human exposures at the intended therapeutic doses. Additional studies to characterize the toxicity of M1 
and M6 were not feasible due to the difficulty in synthesizing sufficient quantities, combined with the fact 
that they have physicochemical and pharmacokinetic limitations to achieving higher exposures by direct 
IV or oral administration routes than those already achieved in the rat after oral ivacaftor administration. 
The exposure margin to the expected human therapeutic dose for M6-ivacaftor was less than 1 in all 
ivacaftor and lumacaftor/ivacaftor combination toxicity studies. It is acknowledged that practical issues 
limit the possibility for separate toxicity studies to characterise M6-ivacaftor. However, since 
concentrations of the M6 metabolite were also found to be higher in the lumacaftor/ivacaftor clinical 
studies compared with the monotherapy programme, it is considered that receptor binding and ion 
channel assays to assess the potential for off-target activity should be provided for this metabolite to 
provide reassurance.  This wil be performed as a post authorisation study, as requested by the CHMP 
Local Tolerance  
The local tolerance of lumacaftor was assessed, to aid in setting worker protection levels, as exposure to 
the skin and eyes may occur during handling, particularly in the active substance manufacturing 
setting.Potential skin irritation of lumacaftor was assessed in an in vitro EPISKIN skin irritation test 
according to the OECD 439 guideline (protocol no VX-809-TX-020, final report not provided). Lumacaftor 
(10 ± 2 mg) was applied to human epidermis skin, EPISKIN, constructs consisting of human-derived 
epidermal keratinocytes, which had been cultured to form a multi-layered, highly differentiated epidermis

with a functional stratum corneum. Cell viability was determined after a 15 minute exposure period by 
reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2), 5,-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT). Tissue viability 
following lumacaftor exposure was 99.2±4.9% compared to 100±4.9% in the negative control group, 
and lumacaftor was therefore predicted to be non-irritant to the skin. The potential for severe ocular 
corrosiveness and irritation of lumacaftor was assessed in the in vitro Bovine Corneal Opacity and 
Permeability (BCOP) assay, according to the OECD 437 guideline (protocol no VX-809-TX-021, final 
report not provided). Isolated bovine corneas were incubated with a 20% w/w lumacaftor suspension in 
0.9% saline for 4 hours at 32ºC. Subsequently, corneal opacity was assessed using an opacitometer, and 
corneal permeability was measured by the leakage of sodium fluorescein from the anterior to the 
posterior of the cornea over a period of 90 minutes. By combining the results from these two endpoints, 
an in vitro irritancy score was deduced. This score was 6.0 for lumacaftor, and according to an established 
prediction model, lumacaftor was subsequently classified as a non-corrosive/non-severe eye irritant.  
Ivacaftor was demonstrated to have no skin irritation potential following in vivo dermal exposure and to 
be noncorrosive/non-irritating to eye.  
Overall, findings from available non-clinical studies suggest that lumacaftor and ivacaftor are non-irritant 
to both dermal and ocular surfaces and no irritation potential is expect from the combined use. 
Other toxicity studies 
While not discussed specifically in the dossier, lumacaftor is believed to have low potential for 
phototoxicity after oral administration. Presented UV absorption data show a peak at 293 nm. However, 
based on the absence of ophthalmology findings in repeat-dose studies, and the fact that no accumulation 
in the skin or eyes occurs after oral administration in distribution studies, the applicant considers the risk 
of phototoxicity negligible. The lack of a dedicated phototoxicity evaluation has been reflected in the 
SmPC, section 5.3.   
Dependence studies have not been conducted for lumacaftor, since tissue distribution studies in rats have 
shown that lumacaftor does not cross the blood-brain-barrier to any appreciable extent. In addition, 
lumacaftor had no effects on central nervous system function in standard safety pharmacology studies in 
rats, in repeat-dose toxicity studies in mice, rats, and dogs, or on behaviour and learning in developing 
pups in the prenatal and postnatal development study. 
All known and potential impurities including residual solvents in lumacaftor drug substance and drug 
product were either controlled to ICH classification limits or qualified in the repeat-dose animal toxicity 
studies described above, in additional genotoxicity assays conducted for specific substances with in silico 
predictions for mutagenicity (all 4 compounds tested which included starting materials and potential 
process impurities were negative), or based on published toxicity studies. Impurities VRT-087778 and 
VRT-0908591 were considered qualified based on the 3-month toxicity study conducted in dogs with 
lumacaftor. Specified impurities in the ivacaftor SDD drug product have been previously assessed and are 
adequately controlled. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Both lumacaftor and ivacaftor exceed the trigger value of >0.01 μg/L for the Phase I estimate of 
PECSURFACEWATER, and a Phase II environmental fate and effect analysis is therefore required for both 
substances. In addition, the octanol/water partition coefficients of ivacaftor and lumacaftor were close to 
the trigger value of 4.5, and fish bioaccumulation studies will be conducted as a part of the Phase II Tier 
B assessments.  
For lumacaftor, studies on physical-chemical properties and fate and Phase II Tier A studies have been 
started, some are ongoing and some have been reported. The available data indicate that lumacaftor is 
Assessment report

Page 29/104 
 
  
unlikely to represent a risk to groundwater and micro-organisms, and preliminary data indicate that 
lumacaftor is unlikely to reach the terrestrial compartment as a result of spreading of sewage sludge onto 
agricultural land. For ivacaftor, all studies are ongoing and no data are available.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
An appropriate non-clinical package has been submitted for lumacaftor and ivacaftor to support this MAA. 
Pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology of lumacaftor and ivacaftor, both separately and in 
combination, have been well-characterised. The rationale for developing the combination of lumacaftor 
and ivacaftor (Orkambi) for the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients homozygous for the F508del mutation 
has been supported by appropriate in vitro pharmacology studies in primary human bronchial epithelial 
cultures. Recent published evidence relating to the effect of ivacaftor on lumacaftor-corrected 
F508del-CFTR has been fully discussed by the applicant. 
No target organ toxicity was identified in lumacaftor repeat dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs of up to 
12 months duration and up to 3 months duration with the lumacaftor/ivacaftor combination. Ivacaftor has 
been confirmed to be non-carcinogenic. Lumacaftor was not genotoxic and not carcinogenic in the 
short-term alternative 26-week Tg.rasH2 transgenic carcinogenicity assay and the 2-year rat bioassay. 
Lumacaftor and ivacaftor are not teratogenic. Effects seen on fertility and early embryonic development, 
as well as pre-and postnatal development (ivacaftor only) have been adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
Findings of cataracts were observed in juvenile rats dosed with ivacaftor at 0.32 times the maximum 
recommended human dose based on systemic exposure of ivacaftor and its metabolites when 
co-administered with lumacaftor as Orkambi. Cataracts were not observed in foetuses derived from rat 
dams treated during the organogenesis stage of foetal development, in rat pups exposed to a certain 
extent through milk ingestion prior to weaning, or in repeated dose toxicity studies with ivacaftor. The 
potential relevance of these findings in humans is unknown. This is included in the SmPC.  
Since concentrations of the M6 metabolite were also found to be higher in the lumacaftor/ivacaftor clinical 
studies compared with the monotherapy programme receptor binding and ion channel assays to assess 
the potential for off-target activity should be provided for this metabolite in post-authorisation phase as 
described in the RMP. Furthermore, the applicant agreed to investigate the potential inhibition of OAT1, 
OAT3, OCT1 and OCT2 by ivacaftor and lumacaftor as described in the RMP. 
The current available data on the ERA programme do not allow a definitive conclusion on the potential risk 
of lumacaftor and ivacaftor to the environment, and the applicant agreed to perform the required studies 
and complete the lumacaftor and ivacaftor ERAs post-authorisation. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In conclusion, the CHMP was of the opinion that the non-clinical profile of Orkambi was adequately 
characterised. Results from pharmacokinetics studies, the choice of species as well as the outcome of the 
toxicology studies are in full support of granting the MAA for Orkambi.  
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/686121/2018 
Page 31/104 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
CHMP recommends the following points be addressed: Submission of further ERA  studies is expected by 
the end of 2015. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
This application for Orkambi is supported by 17 clinical studies, which evaluated lumacaftor monotherapy 
or a combination of lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy. Of these studies, 15 were completed and 2 were 
ongoing at the time of filing. The clinical development programme includes 12 phase I studies in healthy 
volunteers/subjects without cystic fibrosis and 5 phase II/III studies in CF patients. In addition there are 
studies with ivacaftor monotherapy which have already been considered during the assessment of the 
MAA of Kalydeco. These include VX06-770-003, which is the PK study using radiolabelled ivacaftor, 
VX08-770-104 which evaluated the effects of ivacaftor in CF patients homozygous with F508del-CFTRs 
and VX08-770-105 which is the long-term extension of VX08-770-104. 
The ongoing studies include a PK study (011) in 6-11 years, which is a development to support a future 
extension of the indication to children aged between 6-11 and a long-term uncontrolled study (study 105) 
to provide evidence on long-term safety and maintenance of efficacy. 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor was adequately characterised and has been assessed in the MAA of 
ivacaftor (Kalydeco). To support this application, the applicant has characterised the PK of lumacaftor 
monotherapy and the PK of both ivacaftor and lumacaftor, when they are co-administered and when they 
are administered together as a fixed-dose combination tablet. In line with the legal basis of this 
application, the data on ivacaftor (previously authorised as Kalydeco) were adequately assessed for the 
purpose of this application for the FDC.  The new data submitted in support of this application includes 11 
phase I clinical studies in healthy volunteers, one phase I study in patients with moderate hepatic injury 
and PK data from five phase II/III studies in cystic fibrosis patients. 
Analytical methods 
Lumacaftor 
An analytical method was established and validated for the determination of lumacaftor and 
M28-Lumacaftor in human plasma with K2 EDTA or K3 by HPLC with MS/MS detection. The lower limit of 
quantification (LLOQ) and upper limit of quantitation (ULOQ) were 2.00 ng/mL and 2000 ng/mL, 
respectively for lumacaftor. The method met the requirements for selectivity, sensitivity, precision, and 
accuracy, and showed no carryover from analyte or internal standard. Throughout the lifecycle of the 
method, there were some small changes to the method, typically associated with assay improvements or 
method transfers to a contract research organization (CRO).  
Ivacaftor 
Ivacaftor was quantitated in plasma in all combination studies, using a validated analytical method. 
Ivacaftor’s major metabolites, M1- and M6-ivacaftor, were also quantitated in plasma in all combination 
studies (except in Study 007), using a validated analytical method. The assay method was sufficiently 
selective for endogenous substances and met the requirements for precision and accuracy at each level 
for ivacaftor, M1-ivacaftor, and M6-ivacaftor.  
Absorption  
Lumacaftor has low aqueous solubility and high permeability assessed via the colorectal adenocarcinoma 
(Caco-2) cell system. Although pH-dependent solubility was observed, the lumacaftor drug substance is 
practically insoluble in water and buffer solutions of pH 1.0 to pH 8.0. Therefore, lumacaftor is suggested 
to be a BCS Class 2 (low solubility/high permeability) compound. Ivacaftor could not be classified 
definitively by the BCS. It has low solubility, suggesting that it is either a BCS Class 2 (low solubility/ high 
permeability) or Class 4 (low solubility/low permeability) drug. However, its low solubility and 
non-specific binding to culture materials precluded an acceptable determination of its permeability using 
the Caco-2 cell system. Following multiple oral dose administrations of lumacaftor, the exposure of 
lumacaftor increased roughly proportionally with dose from 50 to 1000 mg qd. In subjects with CF, the 
lumacaftor Cmax and AUC also increases approximately proportional with the dose over the LUM 25 mg 
qd to 400 mg q12h dose range. The exposure of lumacaftor increased approximately 1.6- to 2.0-fold 
when given with fat containing food (Study 012). The median (range) time of the maximum concentration 
(tmax) is approximately 4.0 (2.0, 9.0) hours in the fed state. Following multiple oral dose administration 
of ivacaftor in combination with lumacaftor, the exposure of ivacaftor generally increased with dose from 
150 mg q12h to 250 mg q12h (Study 006). The exposure of ivacaftor when given in combination with 
lumacaftor increased approximately 2.5- to 3.4-fold when given with food containing fat (Study 012). 
Therefore, ivacaftor given in combination with lumacaftor should be administered with fat-containing 
food. The median (range) tmax is approximately 4.0 (2.0, 6.0) hours in the fed state.

Bioavailability 
No intravenous data is available therefore relative bioavailability cannot be determined. Both compounds 
show reasonable systemic bioavailability following oral dosing in man.  The Tmax for lumacaftor is 3- 6 
hours and Cmax following the proposed dose of 400 mg bid is 23.7 µg/ml. The tmax for ivacaftor when 
administered in the fixed dose combination is approximately 4 hours and Cmax for the proposed dose of 
250mg bid is 1.33 µg/ml. 
Bioequivalence 
Various formulations have been used in the development of lumacaftor and in combination which includes 
suspension, capsules and tablets. Comparative exposure of the different formulations of lumacaftor was 
seen in single dose studies in healthy volunteers. Exposure of the suspension is lower than that seen for 
capsules and tablets. Early clinical studies were conducted with the co-administration of both ivacaftor 
and lumacaftor. A cross-over study (007) was conducted to evaluate the relative bioavailability of the 
fixed dose combination tablet as compared to the separate tablets. The tablet and FDC appear to be 
bioequivalent, and the only parameter that did not meet standard bioequivalence criteria is the Cmax of 
ivacaftor (GLSMR [90% CI] - 1.20 [1.09, 1.33]). However for practical purposes this is acceptable and the 
PK results from tablet formulation can be considered applicable to the FDC as well. 
Influence of food 
Bioavailability of ivacaftor tablet formulations increases approximately 2.5- to 4-fold when administered 
with food and ivacaftor is therefore recommended to be administered with fat-containing food, as 
reflected in the SmPC. The effect of food on the relative bioavailibity of lumacaftor and ivacaftor when 
administered as a fixed dose combination was evaluated in study 012. This study showed that exposure 
of both lumacaftor and ivacaftor was increased when administered with a high-fat meal.  
Distribution 
Lumacaftor and ivacaftor are extensively bound to plasma proteins (approximately 99%), with 
lumacaftor binding to albumin and ivacaftor to alpha-1-glycoprotein & albumin. Distribution parameters 
of lumacaftor were estimated in single- and multiple-dose studies in healthy subjects and via a population 
PK modeling approach. In the single- and multiple-dose escalation study (Study 001), lumacaftor had a 
moderate mean apparent volume of distribution (~36 to 53 L) over the 25- to 400-mg dose range 
studied. From the population PK analysis, the typical estimates of final PK model parameters (%CV) for 
the reference covariate effects (70 kg, 18 years, and CF subject) were 2.38 L/h (29.4%) for CL/F and, 
23.5 L (48.7%) for Vc/F, 33.3 L (30.5%) for Vp/F, and 3.65 L/h (35.2%) for Q/F. Ivacaftor has a large 
apparent volume of distribution, suggesting penetration of ivacaftor into tissues. From the population PK 
analysis, the typical estimates of final PK model parameters (%CV) for the reference covariate effects (70 
kg, 18 years, and CF subject) were 25.1 L/h (40.5%) for CL/F, 95.0 L (53.9%) for Vc/F, 201 L (26.6%) for 
Vp/F, and 23.9 L/h for Q/F. 
Metabolism 
Lumacaftor is not extensively metabolized in human with the majority of lumacaftor excreted unchanged 
in the faeces. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that lumacaftor is mainly metabolised via oxidation and 
glucuronidation. The transporter responsible for the biliary excretion has not been identified. 
Hydroxy-lumacaftor (M1-lumacaftor; later referred to as M22-lumacaftor) was the primary metabolite 
observed following incubation of lumacaftor with liver microsomal preparations, while lumacaftor 
glucuronide (M2-lumacaftor) was the primary metabolite detected following incubation of lumacaftor with 
hepatocytes. M1-lumacaftor and M2-lumacaftor were also observed to be the circulating metabolites of 
lumacaftor in rats and dogs; however, these metabolites were not considered to be major metabolites as 
their levels were less than 10%. Following administration of a single oral dose of [14C]-LUM 200 mg (100 
Assessment report

Page 39/104 
 
 
uCi), most of the circulating radioactivity in plasma was associated with the parent drug and 
M28-lumacaftor. M28 lumacaftor has a long terminal half-life (approximately 100 hours). Approximately 
62% of the radioactivity was associated with unchanged lumacaftor. M28-lumacaftor represented 21% of 
the total radioactivity and a metabolite:parent AUC ratio of 35%. No other metabolite exposure exceeded 
a 5.4% metabolite ratio. These findings indicated that the majority of exposure in plasma was related to 
the unchanged lumacaftor. Similar to plasma, unchanged [14C]-lumacaftor was the major component 
excreted in faeces. The renal route of elimination of [14C]-lumacaftor is negligible.  
Ivacaftor is extensively metabolized in humans. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that ivacaftor is 
primarily metabolized by CYP3A. M1-ivacaftor and M6-ivacaftor are the 2 major metabolites of ivacaftor 
in humans. M1-ivacaftor has approximately 1/6th the potency of ivacaftor and is considered 
pharmacologically active. M6-ivacaftor has less than 1/50th the potency of ivacaftor and is not considered 
pharmacologically active. After 150 mg q12h of the commercial tablet formulation in the fed state, the 
mean AUC ratio was approximately 2.7 for M1/ivacaftor and approximately 2.8 for M6/ivacaftor. As 
ivacaftor is metabolised by CYP3A and lumacaftor induces CYP3A, this will increase the contribution of 
CYP 3A4 to the elimination. The potential for inducing metabolism of ivacaftor when administered as FDC 
was studied in Study 005, which 005 showed that mean VX-809 plasma concentration time profiles were 
similar after the administration of VX-809 alone or in combination with VX-770. M28 metabolite showed 
slightly higher concentrations on Day 1 and Day 14 of the combination treatment period relative to the 
VX-809 alone treatment period. 
Plasma concentration-time profiles of VX-770 and M1 were comparable after the administration of 
VX-770 alone or in combination with VX-809 after a single dose. However after multiple dosing for 14 
days, there was a massive reduction in VX-770 and M1 plasma concentrations when VX-770 was 
co-administered with VX-809 as summarized below. 
The above results necessitate the use of the higher dose of ivacaftor (250mg bd) when administered as 
combination with lumacaftor as compared to the licensed ivacaftor monotherapy dose (150mg bd). 
Assessment report  
EMA/686121/2018 
Page 40/104 
 
 
 
However, even with the increased dose, concentrations of Ivacaftor and M1 are markedly lower than 
those seen with monotherapy (table below). 
Elimination 
Elimination in the faeces was the predominant route of elimination for lumacaftor and its metabolites in 
human ADME Study 004, with minimal renal excretion. Following administration of a single oral dose of 
[14C]-LUM 200 mg in healthy male subjects, the mean recovery of total radioactivity in urine and faeces 
samples ranged from 94% to 100% (mean of 98%). Individual faecal recoveries ranged from 81% to 
93% of the administered dose (mean of 90%), and individual urinary recoveries ranged from 6.9% to 
13% (mean of 8.6%). Most of the radioactivity observed in faeces was associated with unchanged 
lumacaftor and a monohydroxylated metabolite (M22-lumacaftor), accounting for an average of 51% 
(lumacaftor) and 17% (M22-lumacaftor) of the radioactive dose in Study 004. These findings as well as 
the low levels of plasma-circulating glucuronides indicate that the majority of lumacaftor was likely 
eliminated unchanged from the body into the faeces. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Steady-state plasma concentrations of lumacaftor in healthy subjects were generally reached after 
approximately 5 to 14 days of treatment. Based on AUC, the accumulation ratio in plasma on Day 14 
following LUM qd dosing ranged from 1.9 to 2.2 across the tested dose levels (LUM 50 to 200 mg). The PK 
profile of lumacaftor was investigated in subjects with CF following multiple oral dosing. The t1/2 and 
accumulation findings are consistent with the data observed in healthy subjects, the median steady-state 
AUCs in subjects with CF were approximately 2-fold lower than that of Study 005 in healthy subjects when 
comparing the same dose (200 mg qd). A similar effect was seen on the M28 metabolite. The metabolite 
to parent drug ratio (M28-lumacaftor/lumacaftor) based on AUC at steady state decreased from 33% at 
a LUM 25 mg/day dose to 8% at a LUM 800 mg/day dose after 28 days of lumacaftor treatment. 
Ivacaftor shows a decrease in exposure on multiple dosing due to induction by lumacaftor and a higher 
dose of 250 mg is proposed.  It is proposed that the exposure with this higher dose is still lower than that 
seen for 150 mg monotherapy. 
Population PK 
Population PK analyses for repeated-measures endpoints were conducted via nonlinear mixed effects 
modeling with a qualified installation of the nonlinear mixed effects modeling (NONMEM) software. The 
population PK showed that lumacaftor CL/F decreased with increasing age, with a point estimate of -0.265 
for the effect estimate. For the typical 12 year old, this translates to an 11% greater CL/F when compared 
to the reference 18 year old. For the typical 50 year old subject, this translates to a CL/F value that is 24% 
lower than the reference 18 year old. Lumacaftor bioavailability was 1.81 times higher in healthy subjects

and D1 was increased by a factor of 1.34, while ka and ALAG were decreased by factors of 0.663 and 
0.514, respectively. The higher exposre in healthy subjects is attributed to an effect on absorption 
however the mechanism and implications of this have not been discussed. Body weight was an important 
predictor of variability in ivacaftor CL=F. Ivacaftor CL=F was 39% and 131% of the reference value of 
25.1 L/h for the typical 20 kg and 100 kg subject, respectively, when compared to the reference subject 
(70 kg). 
Ivacaftor bioavailability was 1.53 times higher in healthy subjects. The reason for this is not known; since 
prior analyses have indicated that bioavailability in CF subjects is equivalent when comparing healthy 
subjects to CF subjects. Studies 011 and 102 are the only two studies contributing ivacaftor data. Since 
the study population of 011 was small, it is likely that Study 102 is affecting the overall estimate. It is 
possible that the bioavailability difference can be attributed to inter-study variability. 
The population PK modelling is comprehensive and appears to have been well performed.  The 
demographics of the data set is limited with limited representation of race other than white and the oldest 
individual being only 57 years old and the heaviest being 107 kg. This is understandable in the context of 
the demographics of the target patient population. The approach taken in the analysis of covariates is 
atypical with it being based on emphasising parameter estimation rather than stepwise hypothesis 
testing.  The support for this approach given by the company seems reasonable and this was based on 
data from the phase I/II studies, thus shrinkage should not be an issue.  It would have been useful to 
have seen OFVs for the models, however it is noted that there is a small improvement in residual 
variability following inclusion of the covariates. The modelling is used to investigate covariates and for 
PKPD modelling of the phase III data, however this data is only used as supportive data.  VPC’s are 
provided stratified by study and dose and boot strapping of final parameter estimates.  There are no 
individual plots of observed versus predicted concentrations which would be expected, however given the 
detailed VPCs this can be accepted. Weight is fixed with the expected exponents of 0.75 and 1.0 for 
clearance and volume of distribution respectively.  It would normally be expected that these exponents 
would be determined by the model however plots are supportive of this relationship for adults.  It is 
questioned whether weight and age are both needed in the model considering that the age range is 6 
years and above and given the limited demographics. It is considered that the modelling is acceptable to 
support dosing in patients over the included demographic range. 
Special populations 
The PK of lumacaftor and ivacaftor has not been studied in subjects with renal impairment as the initial PK 
data suggests that there was minimal excretion of the parent drug and metabolites in the urine. A study 
in renal impairment is normally required even for drugs that are not renally cleared due to the effect of 
uremic factors on hepatic clearance. An analysis on CRCL was performed in the POPPK analysis and no 
effect of mild or moderate impairment was seen on the PK. Study 010 was conducted to evaluate PK after 
lumacaftor and ivacaftor combination therapy in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, according to 
Child-Pugh B classification. The impact of mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) on the PK of lumacaftor 
given in combination with ivacaftor has not been studied, but the increase in exposure is expected to be 
less than 50%. Therefore, no dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment. 
Following multiple doses of lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor for 10 days, subjects with 
moderately impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh B) had higher exposures (AUCτ by approximately 50% 
and Cmax by approximately 30%) compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics. Therefore, 
the dose should be reduced by 25% for patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Studies have not 
been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C); however, exposure is 
expected to be higher than in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Therefore, after weighing the 
risks and benefits of treatment, Orkambi should be used with caution at a maximum dose of lumacaftor 
400 mg/ivacaftor 250 mg total daily dose, given as one tablet in the morning and one tablet in the 
evening. The SmPC includes the adequate guidance on treatment of patients with hepatic disorders.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Based on studies in cultured human hepatocytes, lumacaftor has the potential to induce CYP3A4, CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Lumacaftor was a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C8 in vitro. Ivacaftor has 
potential to inhibit CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 in vitro. As per the SmPC recommendations, no dose adjustment 
is necessary when CYP3A inhibitors are initiated in patients currently taking Orkambi. When initiating 
Orkambi in patients taking strong CYP3A inhibitors, the dose should be reduced to one tablet daily 
(lumacaftor 200 mg/ivacaftor 125 mg total daily dose) for the first week of treatment to allow for the 
steady state induction effect of lumacaftor. Following this period, the recommended daily dose should be 
continued. 
There was no meaningful impact of ivacaftor on the PK of both lumacaftor and M28-lumacaftor when the 
2 study drugs were co-administered at a dose of LUM 200 mg q24h/IVA 150 mg q12h for 14 days, 
although the exposures of lumacaftor was relatively lower in the presence of ivacaftor. There was 
however a large decrease in plasma exposure of ivacaftor (~ 80%), but no meaningful impact on the 
exposure of M6-ivacaftor when the 2 study drugs were co-administered at a dose of LUM 200 mg 
q24h/IVA 150 mg q12h for 14 days. These results are consistent with the predicted induction of CYP3A by 
lumacaftor. Lumacaftor decreases the exposure of ivacaftor due to induction of P450.  Ivacaftor appears 
to cause a small decrease in the exposure of lumacaftor however this is attributed to clinical variability. 
Study 009 also evaluated the effect of long- and short-acting bronchodilators in healthy adult subjects 
treated with lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor. The PK of lumacaftor and ivacaftor were 
comparable on co-administration with the various bronchodilators used in the study. A prototypical probe 
study for the effect of lumacaftor on a CYP3A substrate such as midazolam was not conducted due to the 
fact that ivacaftor is a sensitive CYP3A substrate, which showed the expected large effect with substantial 
reductions in exposure due to lumacaftor induction. Itraconazole had no effect on the PK of lumacaftor 
and M28-lumacaftor, but caused a substantial increase (by 4.3-fold) in the exposure of ivacaftor when 
given in combination with lumacaftor. A lower magnitude of increase (2.4-fold) was observed in the 
exposures of M1-ivacaftor in the presence of itraconazole; however, there was no change in the exposure 
of M6-ivacaftor. Although itraconazole caused a substantial increase in the exposure of ivacaftor when 
given in combination with lumacaftor, due to the induction of CYP3A by lumacaftor, the net ivacaftor 
exposure does not exceed that when given in the absence of lumacaftor at a dose of 150 mg q12h (the 
approved dose for ivacaftor monotherapy). Therefore, no change in the dose of lumacaftor and ivacaftor 
combination therapy is recommended for co-administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors.  
Ciprofloxacin had minimal effect on the PK of lumacaftor and M28-lumacaftor, but caused a mild increase 
in the exposure of ivacaftor when given in combination with lumacaftor. The increase in exposure of 
ivacaftor is not considered significant as the exposures were substantially lower than ivacaftor 
monotherapy (150 mg q12h) exposures. The results indicate ciprofloxacin has a minimal to mild effect on 
lumacaftor and ivacaftor exposure; therefore no change in the dose of lumacaftor and ivacaftor 
combination therapy is recommended when co-administered with ciprofloxacin. Rifampin altered the 
shape of the concentration time profile of lumacaftor but had no substantial impact on the overall 
exposure. M28-lumacaftor exposures mildly increased (~35%) in the presence of rifampin. Rifampin 
induces the metabolism of CYP3A, the enzyme primarily responsible for the metabolism of ivacaftor. 
When given in combination with rifampin, the exposures of ivacaftor substantially decreased (~50%), 
M1-ivacaftor exposure mildly decreased (~35%), and M6-ivacaftor mildly increased (~29%). Based on 
these results, co-administration of lumacaftor and ivacaftor combination therapy with rifampin or any 
strong inducer of CYP3A is not recommended because ivacaftor exposure will be decreased, which may 
lead to loss of efficacy.  
The effects of lumacaftor monotherapy or lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor on the PK of hormonal 
contraceptives are not known; however, since lumacaftor is an inducer of CYP3A, it may reduce the

effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Hormonal contraceptives should not be relied on as an effective 
method of contraception when co-administered with lumacaftor and ivacaftor combination therapy. The 
SmPC for Orkambi fully describes the potential interactions of ivacaftor and/or lumacaftor with other 
medicinal products. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The PD of lumacaftor have been assessed in studies evaluating lumacaftor monotherapy (Studies 101 and 
102) and/or lumacaftor and ivacaftor combination therapy (Study 102) in subjects with CF who are 
homozygous (Studies 101 and 102) or heterozygous (Study 102) for the F508del-CFTR mutation. Results 
from Study 102 demonstrated proof of concept that pharmacologic modulation of CFTR function through 
treatment with lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor can result in clinical benefit in subjects who are 
homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. A phase 3 study, study 770-104 which evaluated ivacaftor 
monotherapy in cystic fibrosis patients who were homozygous with F508del-CFTR was assessed as part of 
the ivacaftor MAA. This study provides important evidence in the context of this application for the lack of 
efficacy of ivacaftor monotherapy in this patient population. 
Mechanism of action 
Ivacaftor is a potentiator of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) that increases the 
channel activity of CFTR protein located at the cell surface through increased gating activity, resulting in 
increased chloride transport. For ivacaftor to act, the CFTR channel must first be activated by 
cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). That would exclude on theoretical grounds that ivacaftor has 
any effect in class I and II mutations. Ivacaftor potentiated chloride transport of G551D-CFTR protein, in 
both recombinant cells carrying the G551D-CFTR mutation and primary cultures of HBE isolated from the 
bronchi of a patient with CF carrying the G551D and F508del CFTR mutations (G551D/F508del-HBE). In 
addition to the G551D CFTR gating mutation, ivacaftor increased the open probability of all other CFTR 
gating mutations tested, including G178R, S549N, S549R, G551S, G970R, G1244E, S1251N, S1255P, 
and G1349D. This led to a greater than 10-fold increase in chloride transport for all 10 CFTR gating 
mutations. 
Lumacaftor partially corrects the fundamental molecular defect caused by F508del-CFTR to increase the 
amount of functional F508del-CFTR at the cell surface, resulting in enhanced chloride transport. The 
channel gating activity of F508del-CFTR delivered to the cell surface by lumacaftor can be potentiated by 
ivacaftor to further enhance chloride transport. When added to F508del/F508del-HBE, the magnitude of 
chloride transport observed with the combination of lumacaftor and either acute or chronic ivacaftor 
treatment was greater than that observed with lumacaftor alone. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Study  101  was  a  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallel-group,  multiple-dose,  multi- 
center, dose-finding Phase 2a study of orally-administered VX-809 in subjects with CF. Enrolment was 
planned at approximately 20 centres, and approximately 90 adult subjects who were homozygous for the 
F508del-CFTR (previously referred to as the ΔF508-CFTR) mutation were to be enrolled. 
The study had 2 cohorts:  
Group A: Group A (45 subjects) was screened and randomized to receive either 25 mg of VX-809 (18 
subjects), 50 mg of VX-809 (18 subjects), or placebo (9 subjects) for 28 days. 
Group B: Group B (45 new subjects) was screened and randomized to receive either 100 mg of VX-809 
(18 subjects), 200 mg of VX-809 (18 subjects), or placebo (9 subjects) for 28 days 
Assessment report

Assessments included PK, Nasal potential difference (NPD), sweat chloride, spirometry (FEV1, forced vital 
capacity [FVC], and forced expiratory flow over the middle half of the FVC [FEF25-75]), Cystic Fibrosis 
Questionnaire – Revised (CFQ-R) and safety.  
Nasal potential difference (NPD): At Day 28, mean changes from baseline and differences from placebo in 
zero  chloride  plus  isoproterenol  response  of  the  NPD  were  not  statistically  significant  for  any  VX-809 
treatment group 
Sweat chloride: Reductions from baseline in mean sweat chloride were observed as early as Day 7 in the 
50, 100, and 200 mg VX-809 groups and tended to be largest in the 200 mg group. The magnitude of 
decreases in these 3 groups did not increase with time, and the decreases were not sustained at Day 7 
follow-up. No mean decreases from baseline were seen in the 25 mg group. Mean changes in sweat 
chloride from baseline to Day 28 were statistically significant in the 100 mg VX-809 (-5.29 mmol/L; 
P=0.0173) and 200 mg (-7.38 mmol/L; P=0.0008) groups. The differences between these treatment 
groups and the placebo group for the least squares mean change from baseline were also statistically 
significant: -6.13 mmol/L (P=0.0498) for the 100 mg group and -8.21 mmol/L (P=0.0092) for the 200 mg 
group. The linear trend was statistically significant (-2.099; P=0.0013), suggesting a decreasing mean 
average sweat chloride with increasing dose. 
FEV1: Results of the ANCOVA analysis of change and percent change from baseline to Day 28 in FEV1 
showed no statistically significant results for either change from baseline, percent change from baseline, 
or difference between treatment and placebo for any VX-809 treatment group. 
CFQ-R: For the CFQ-R results, at Day 28, the mean change in respiratory domain score in the placebo 
group was +4.5; in the VX-809 25-, 50-, 100-, and 200-mg treatment groups, the mean changes were 
–5.2, –6.3, –1.30, and +2.2, respectively. There were no clear or sustained improvements (i.e., increase 
in score of ≥5 points, the minimal clinically important difference) in the respiratory domain or in any other 
domains of the CFQ-R in any dose group over time. 
Study 102 was a Phase 2, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose study of 
lumacaftor monotherapy, and lumacaftor and ivacaftor combination therapy in subjects with CF 
homozygous or heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. There were approximately 293 patients in 
this study who were evaluated in four different cohorts. In all the treatment cohorts, patients were 
treated with lumacaftor monotherapy for the first few days (14-28 days depending on the cohort) 
followed immediately by combination therapy with lumacaftor/ivacaftor for further 7-28 days. As there 
was no wash-out between monotherapy and combination therapy, a clear base-line value for the patients 
prior to the combination therapy is not available and makes it difficult to interpret accurately the effects 
of the combination.  
Assessments included safety, PK, sweat chloride tests, spirometry measurements (FEV1; forced vital 
capacity [FVC]; forced expiratory flow midexpiratory phase [FEF25%-75%]; forced expiratory volume (L) 
in 1 second over forced vital capacity [FEV1/FVC)]); CFQ-R (Cohort 2, Cohort 3, and Cohort 4); and for 
Cohort 4 only, body mass index (BMI) and weight. There were no PD studies of the combination that 
included assessment of NPD or parameters related to the gastrointestinal manifestations of cystic fibrosis 
(except in cohort 4). 
Lumacaftor monotherapy 
Sweat Chloride: Reductions in mean sweat chloride values from baseline were observed beginning at Day 
14 (first scheduled visit after first dose of study drug) in homozygous subjects who received lumacaftor 
monotherapy. At Day 14, all active treatment groups had a statistically significant within-group mean 
reduction from baseline in sweat chloride values. Homozygous subjects who received LUM 600 mg qd had 
the largest adjusted mean reduction from baseline at Day 14 (-9.363 mmol/L, P<0.001). Compared to 
the monotherapy placebo group, the treatment difference in the mean change from baseline at Day 14 in 
Assessment report

homozygous subjects who received LUM 600 mg qd was -9.294 mmol/L (P = 0.005). Homozygous 
subjects who received LUM 400 mg q12h had an adjusted mean reduction from baseline at Day 14 of 
-9.014 mmol/L (P<0.007). Compared to the monotherapy placebo group, the treatment difference in the 
mean change from baseline at Day 14 in homozygous subjects who received LUM 400 mg q12h was 
-8.944 mmol/L (P = 0.028). While these effects were statistically significant, in the context of correction 
of CFTR function the effect-size is not of a clinically relevant magnitude. 
Spirometry: No improvements in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline at Day 28 were observed in any of 
the active treatment groups during the monotherapy period.  
CFQ-R: A statistically significant within group adjusted mean absolute change from baseline at Day 28 in 
CFQ-R respiratory domain score was observed in the LUM 600 mg qd and LUM 400 mg q12h homozygous 
groups (with the largest change in the LUM 600 mg qd group [-9.8 points, P = 0.006]), and the LUM 600 
mg qd heterozygous group (-9.1 points, P = 0.006). 
Lumacaftor and ivacaftor combination therapy 
Sweat Chloride: There were no statistically significant differences in the mean changes or the treatment 
effect between the active treatment groups compared to the placebo group for the mean absolute change 
from Day 28 at Day 56 in sweat chloride values. The observed changes in sweat chloride values during the 
monotherapy period were generally maintained during the combination therapy period, with little change 
following the addition of ivacaftor. A statistically significant within-group adjusted mean absolute change 
from baseline at Day 56 (entire treatment period) in sweat chloride values was observed in all active 
treatment groups, with the LUM 400 mg q12h/IVA 250 mg q12h homozygous group having the largest 
within-group adjusted mean absolute change (-10.432 mmol/L, P = 0.001). The treatment difference for 
the LUM 400 mg q12h/IVA 250 mg q12h homozygous group compared to the pooled combination placebo 
group in the mean absolute change from baseline at Day 56 was -10.990 mmol/L (95% CI: -18.299, 
-3.682), which was statistically significant (P = 0.004). The LUM 600 mg qd/IVA 250 mg q12h 
homozygous group had a within-group adjusted mean absolute change of -8.970 mmol/L (P<0.001). The 
treatment difference for the LUM 600 mg qd/IVA 250 mg q12h homozygous group compared to the 
pooled combination placebo group in the mean absolute change from baseline at Day 56 was -9.528 
mmol/L (95% CI: -15.124, -3.932), which was statistically significant (P = 0.001). 
Spirometry: Subjects who received active treatment with combination (lum/iva) had improvements in 
percent predicted FEV1 when compared with lumacaftor monotherapy for 28 days. The largest 
within-group improvements in the mean absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 from Day 28 at Day 
56 were observed in homozygous subjects who received LUM 600 mg qd in combination with IVA 250 mg 
q12h (6.20 percentage points; P<0.001) and LUM 400 mg q12h in combination with IVA 250 mg q12h 
(6.16 percentage points; P = 0.005). Compared to the pooled combination placebo group, the treatment 
difference in the mean absolute change from Day 28 at Day 56 was 7.77 percentage points (P<0.001) for 
homozygous subjects who received LUM 600 mg qd in combination with IVA 250 mg q12h and 7.72 
percentage points (P = 0.003) for homozygous subjects who received LUM 400 mg q12h in combination 
with IVA 250 mg q12h. Improvements from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 at the end of the 
treatment period (Day 56) were observed in homozygous subjects. Subjects receiving LUM 600 mg qd 
followed by LUM 600 mg qd in combination with IVA 250 mg q12h had the largest within-group 
improvement in the mean absolute change from baseline at Day 56 in percent predicted FEV1 (3.56 
percentage points, P = 0.030). Compared to the pooled combination placebo group, the treatment 
difference in the mean absolute change from baseline at Day 56 was 5.59 percentage points (P = 0.014) 
for these subjects. Subjects receiving LUM 400 mg q12h followed by LUM 400 mg q12h in combination 
with IVA 250 mg q12h had a within-group mean absolute change from baseline at Day 56 of 2.13 
percentage points (P = 0.354) and a treatment difference compared to the pooled combination placebo 
group of 4.16 percentage points (P = 0.137).

CFQ-R: Statistically significant within group adjusted mean absolute change from baseline at Day 28 in 
CFQ-R respiratory domain score was observed in the LUM 600 mg qd and LUM 400 mg q12h homozygous 
groups (with the largest change in the LUM 600 mg qd group [-9.8 points, P = 0.006]), and the LUM 600 
mg qd heterozygous group (-9.1 points, P = 0.006). Statistically significant within group adjusted mean 
absolute change from Day 28 at Day 56 in CFQ-R respiratory domain score was observed in the LUM 400 
mg q12h/IVA 250 mg q12h homozygous group (11.3 points, P = 0.033), the LUM 600 mg qd/IVA 250 mg 
q12h homozygous group (9.1 points, P = 0.016), and the LUM 400 mg qd/IVA 250 mg q12h homozygous 
group (8.2 points, P = 0.030). 
Based on the above results, a consistent pattern as observed with ivacaftor monotherapy in G551D 
patients was not observed. Due to the study design of study 102, a clear interpretation on the effects of 
combination cannot be made. Therefore progressing to phase 3 studies on this data is associated with 
significant risk; however it is agreed that if a positive decision was to be made on starting phase 3 studies 
with this data, the dose-regimens of lum 400mg bd/iva 250 mg bd and lum 600mg qd/iva 250mg bd are 
the most promising to carry-forward. 
There are no specific secondary pharmacology studies except the investigation of the effects of the 
combination lum/iva on QTc. The upper limit of the 2-sided 90% CI for the least squares (LS) mean 
difference from placebo for the time-matched, baseline-adjusted QTcF interval for both the therapeutic 
and supratherapeutic dose regimens did not exceed 10 msec, indicating that lumacaftor and ivacaftor 
combination therapy does not prolong the QTc interval to a clinically significant degree at the therapeutic 
and supratherapeutic dose levels. The lower limit of the 2-sided 97.5% CI for the LS mean difference from 
placebo for the baseline-adjusted QTcF interval for moxifloxacin ranged from 0.0 to 3.0 msec. The lower 
limit did not exceed 5 msec at any time point, indicating that assay sensitivity was not demonstrated 
according to the criteria specified in the protocol. It is noted that the mean Cmax (1.94 µg/mL) and 
AUC0-24h (20.3 µg.h/mL) were lower as compared to the moxifloxacin Cmax and AUC0-24h in the 
manufacturer’s label 3.1 µg/mL for Cmax and 36.1 µg·h/mL for AUC0-24h following a single oral dose of 
moxifloxacin 400 mg, as moxifloxacin was dosed with food in the current study. Further assay sensitivity 
was established according to ICH E14 criteria via an ad-hoc analysis. Moreover it is seen that the effect of 
lum/iva on QTc is predominantly to reduce the QTc interval rather than prolong it even at the 
supra-therapeutic dose as shown in the figure below. Further the clinical experience with lum/iva has not 
raised any significant cardiac safety signals.   
PK-PD modelling 
The PKPD modelling shows a linear relationship for FEV1 and lumacaftor concentration.  It was concluded 
that it was not possible to study the effects of the mono-components in the model.  The effect on FEV1 
appears moderate and the effect of the covariates does not appear to be significant. It is considered an 
omission that the effect of the two components could not be distinguished in the model as this would have 
provided useful supporting data for the combination and the exposure of ivacaftor. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
A full characterisation of the pharmacokinetics of both the individual components lumacaftor and ivacaftor 
as well as that of the fixed dose combination has been provided. Lumacaftor and ivacaftor are both low 
solubility compounds.  Intravenous data is not available therefore high absorption cannot be assumed but 
both components are absorbed following oral dosing and pharmacokinetics of lumacaftor are linear over 
the dose range of 50- 600 mg. High fat food increases the exposure of both lumacaftor and ivacaftor in 
healthy volunteers although timing of the food has not been investigated.  The mean protein binding 
values of [14C]-lumacaftor ranged from 99.97% to 100.00% in human plasma and is predominantly to 
albumin. Ivacaftor, M1-ivacaftor, and M6-ivacaftor were highly bound (>98%) to proteins in human 
Assessment report  
EMA/686121/2018 
Page 47/104 
 
 
plasma at all concentrations tested.  Ivacaftor protein binding to human plasma components, HSA, AAG 
and HGG was greater than 97%, suggesting that ivacaftor was highly bound to most of the proteins of 
human plasma. M1-ivacaftor and M6-ivacaftor were highly (>99%) bound to HSA with low binding to AAG 
and HGG. 
The major route of elimination of lumacaftor was unchanged lumacaftor in faeces. Lumacaftor is 
metabolised by oxidation and glucuronidation however these do not appear to be major elimination 
pathways.  The major circulating metabolite for lumacaftor is M28 but it is claimed that this is less than 
10% at steady state concentrations. Ivacaftor is extensively metabolised predominantly by CYP 3A4.  
M1-ivacaftor and M6-ivacaftor are the 2 major circulating metabolites of ivacaftor. The pharmacokinetics 
of lumacaftor appears to be essentially time independent. Population pharmacokinetics was performed to 
identify PKPD relationships in the phase III studies.  The demographics of the data were limited and did 
not allow for exploration of race other than white or of age above 57 years.  Age and weight were 
significant covariates in the model while gender did not have an effect.  A study performed in moderately 
hepatic impaired patients showed a 50% and 30% increase in exposure, for Cmax and AUC respectively.  
No adjustment in mild impairment is proposed, however the suggested dose in severely impaired patients 
needs to be amended, as per the guidance given in the SmPC.    
Lumacaftor is an inducer of CYP 3A4, 2B6, 2C9 and 2C19, it does not induce CYP1A2.  The M28 metabolite 
of lumacaftor does not induce CYP 3A4. Lumacaftor is an inhibitor of CYP 2C8 and a weak inhibitor of 2C9.  
No time dependency was seen. Ivacaftor also inhibits 2C8, is a weak inhibitor of CYP 2C9.   
The PK of lumacaftor and ivacaftor were comparable on coadministration with the various bronchodilators 
used in the study and ciprofloxacin had only a minimal effect on lumacaftor and caused a 28% increase in 
the exposure of ivacaftor. A prototypical probe study for the effect of lumacaftor on a CYP3A substrate 
such as midazolam was not conducted due to the fact that ivacaftor is a sensitive CYP3A substrate, which 
showed the expected large effect with substantial reductions in exposure due to lumacaftor induction. 
Itraconazole had no effect on the PK of lumacaftor and M28-lumacaftor, but caused a substantial increase 
in the exposure of ivacaftor when given in combination with lumacaftor. A lower magnitude of increase 
was observed in the exposures of M1-ivacaftor in the presence of itraconazole; however, there was no 
change in the exposure of M6-ivacaftor. Rifampin altered the shape of the concentration time profile of 
lumacaftor but had no substantial impact on the overall exposure. M28-lumacaftor exposures mildly 
increased in the presence of rifampin. Rifampin induces the metabolism of CYP3A; when given in 
combination with rifampin, the exposures of ivacaftor substantially decreased, M1-ivacaftor exposure 
mildly decreased, and M6-ivacaftor mildly increased. Based on these results, coadministration of 
lumacaftor and ivacaftor combination therapy with rifampin or any strong inducer of CYP3A is not 
recommended because ivacaftor exposure will be decreased, which may lead to loss of efficacy. 
Considering that lumacaftor is a potent inducer of CYP3A4, and that for CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 substrates 
the interaction is unknown because the effect of lumacaftor + ivacaftor may also be affected by the 
inhibition of CYP2C8 by lumacaftor and CYP2C9 by both lumacaftor and ivacaftor as observed in vitro, the 
CHMP requested detailed information in the SmPC on the concomitant use of Orkambi with CYP450 
substrates along with explanation of measures to be taken (e.g. monitoring) in cases when 
co-administration is required, which was included in the SmPC by the applicant.  
The exposure of ivacaftor (250mg BD) when combined with lumacaftor is lower than the exposure of 
ivacaftor (150mg BD) when used alone despite the higher dose used. However the adequacy of this dose 
in the combination is supported by in-vitro data which shows that F508del-CFTR cells are 10 times more 
sensitive  than  the  G551D-CFTR  cells.  However,  at  the  proposed  higher  dose  of  ivacaftor,  the 
concentrations of the M6 metabolite are higher than in the monotherapy programme and as compared to 
those seen in non-clinical studies. It is considered that receptor binding and ion channel assays to assess 
the potential for off-target activity should be provided for this metabolite to provide reassurance. This will 
be performed as a post authorisation study as described in the RMP.

The mechanism of action of lumacaftor/ivacaftor in the target population is based mainly on in-vitro 
studies. Lumacaftor is an F508del-CFTR corrector. In human bronchial epithelial cells from CF patients 
with homozygous F508del-CFTR, lumacaftor enhanced chloride transport by facilitating the cellular 
processing and trafficking of F508del-CFTR to increase the amount of functional CFTR protein at the cell 
surface.  Ivacaftor is a CFR potentiator that increases the channel activity of the CFTR protein located at 
the cell surface. It also increases chloride transport in HBE cells from CF patients carrying the 
G551D/F508del mutation. The combination of lum/iva has higher magnitude of chloride transport as 
compared to lumacaftor alone in F508del/F508del-HBE cells. 
In pharmacodynamics with lumacaftor monotherapy and lum/iva combination, ivacaftor showed a 
consistent effect on NPD, sweat chloride and lung function, while lumacaftor monotherapy showed an 
effect only on sweat chloride. The magnitude of this effect is not considered clinically relevant in the 
context of CF. The combination seemed to maintain the effect of lumacaftor monotherapy on sweat 
chloride and showed an improvement in lung function (FEV1) especially at the lum 600mg qd/iva 250mg 
bd and lum 400mg bd/iva 250mg bd dose regimens.  
Though the QTc study did not formally demonstrate adequate assay sensitivity, the overall results is 
considered sufficiently reassuring that the risk of QTc prolongation with lum/iva is negligible. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The PK of Orkambi was mainly characterised in healthy volunteer studies, which is acceptable since CF is 
a rare disease. This has been complemented with sufficient PK characterisation in the CF patients in phase 
II/III studies. The exposures of lumacaftor are approximately 2-fold higher in healthy adult volunteers 
compared to subjects with CF. The pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor, when administered with lumacaftor, is 
similar between healthy adult volunteers and subjects with CF. Both lumacaftor and ivacaftor are low 
solubility compounds but are absorbed following oral dosing. The PK of lumacaftor is linear in the dose 
range of 50-1000 mg every 24 hours and the PK of ivacaftor is shown to be linear in the range of 150 mg 
to 250 mg every 12 hours. High fat food increases the exposure of both lumacaftor and ivacaftor. The 
median tmax of lumacaftor and ivacaftor is approximately 4 hours in the fed state. Both lumacaftor and 
ivacaftor are extensively bound to plasma proteins, with lumacaftor binding to albumin and ivacaftor to 
alpha-1-glycoprotein & albumin.  
Lumacaftor is not extensively metabolised in humans with majority of the drug excreted unchanged in the 
faeces.  The apparent terminal half-life is 26 hours. The main metabolic pathway is via oxidation and 
glucoronidation. Ivacaftor is extensively metabolised primarily by CYP3A. M1 and M6 are active 
metabolites, with M1 having 1/6th the potency and M6 having 1/50th the potency of ivacaftor. Majority of 
the ivacaftor is eliminated in the faeces after metabolic conversion. In patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment, the exposure of both lum and iva is increased and hence a dose-reduction is advised in the 
SmPC. Lumacaftor is a CYP3A inducer and hence the exposure of ivacaftor is lowered at steady state when 
administered as a combination with lumacaftor. Hence the dose of ivacaftor (250mg bd) is higher in the 
combination regimen as compared to the ivacaftor monotherapy (150mg bd). Ivacaftor and/or 
lumacaftor were shown to have a large potential for interacting with other medicinal products and hence, 
the CHMP requested detailed information in the SmPC on the concomitant use of Orkambi with other 
medicines, which was implemented by the applicant. The measures to be taken in cases when 
co-administration is required are also included. 
In PD studies, lumacaftor monotherapy had a significant, but not clinically relevant effect on sweat 
chloride which was maintained by the combination lum/iva. There was no additional effect on sweat 
chloride when luma/iva was administered to patients after receiving lumacaftor monotherapy for 28 days. 
Lumacaftor monotherapy caused a dose-dependent decline in FEV1. However, when the combination of 
Assessment report  
EMA/686121/2018 
Page 49/104 
 
 
lum/iva was administered subsequent to lumacaftor monotherapy, there was a reversal of the decline in 
FEV1 and an increase in FEV1 from the baseline was also seen. It is pertinent to note here that ivacaftor 
monotherapy when evaluated in CF patients with G551D defect, had a consistent and significant effect on 
NPD, sweat chloride and FEV1.  
Overall, the pharmacology of the FDC and the single compounds is considered sufficiently characterised 
for marketing authorisation.   
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
The dose-selection of the combination was based on the results of the study 102 which was discussed 
under  pharmacodynamics.  Study  102  was  a  Phase  2,  multicenter,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled, 
multiple-dose study of lumacaftor monotherapy, and lumacaftor and ivacaftor combination therapy in 
subjects  with  CF  who  are  homozygous  or  heterozygous  for  the  F508del-CFTR  mutation.  The  primary 
objective of this study was to evaluate the PK, safety and tolerability when is administered alone or in 
combination with ivacaftor and to evaluate the effect of lumacaftor administered alone or in combination 
with ivacaftor on sweat chloride. Two dose regimens lum 600mg qd/iva 250mg bd and lum 400mg bd/iva 
250 mg bd were selected for phase III studies. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
Pivotal Phase 3 studies VX12-809-103 (Study 103) and VX12-809-104 (Study 104) were randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies that evaluated lumacaftor in combination with 
ivacaftor in subjects aged 12 years and older with CF who are homozygous for the F508del-CFTR 
mutation. 
Methods 
Studies 103 and 104 were similar in study design, population, and treatment regimens. Both studies 
evaluated 2 dosing regimens of lumacaftor (LUM 600 mg qd and LUM 400 mg q12h) in combination with 
ivacaftor (IVA 250 mg q12h) across 24 weeks. Treatment with lumacaftor and ivacaftor or placebo was 
administered in addition to the subject’s usual prescribed CF therapy. The study treatments were to be 
administered within 30 minutes of consuming fat containing food to enhance and ensure sufficient 
systemic exposure.

Schematic of the Study Design (103 and 104) 
Study Participants  
Studies 103 and 104 were sponsored by Vertex and subjects were randomized at 96 (Study 103) and 91 
(Study 104) sites in North America, Europe, and Australia. 
Both studies recruited subjects aged 12 years and above with a confirmed diagnosis of CF, defined as a 
sweat chloride value ≥60 mmol/L by quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis or 2 CF-causing mutations 
and either chronic sinopulmonary disease, or gastrointestinal/ nutritional abnormalities were recruited. 
Enrolment was limited to subjects who had a FEV1 ≥40 and ≤90 percent of predicted normal.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was the absolute change from baseline in percent predicted 
FEV1 (with a unit of percentage points) at Week 24. Percent predicted FEV1 was the ratio of FEV1 (L) to 
the predicted FEV1 (L), expressed as a percentage.  
The secondary efficacy endpoints were: 
•  Relative Change From Baseline in Percent Predicted FEV1 at Week 24 
•  Absolute Change From Baseline in BMI at Week 24 
•  Absolute Change From Baseline in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain Score at Week 24 
•  Response  Defined  as  ≥5%  Increase  in  Average  Relative  Change  From  Baseline  in  Percent 
Predicted FEV1 at Week 16 and at Week 24 
•  Number of Pulmonary Exacerbations Through Week 24 
Pulmonary exacerbation was defined as a new or change in antibiotic therapy (IV, inhaled, or oral) for any 
4 or more of the predefined signs/symptoms. This definition was based on the definition of a pulmonary 
exacerbation used in previous clinical studies, including ivacaftor clinical studies.  
Additional secondary endpoints were: Absolute and relative changes from baseline  of FEV1 in litres, 
forced vital capacity (FVC), pp FVC, forced mid-expiratory flow rate (FEF25-75%), pp FEF25-75% and 
FEV1/FVC at week 24. Additional endpoints related to pulmonary exacerbation were: time-to-first 
Assessment report  
EMA/686121/2018 
Page 51/104 
 
 
 
 
pulmonary exacerbation, the incidence of having at least 1 pulmonary exacerbation, number of days with 
pulmonary exacerbation,  number of pulmonary exacerbation requiring hospitalization, number of days 
hospitalized for pulmonary exacerbation, time-to-first hospitalization for pulmonary exacerbation, 
number of pulmonary exacerbation requiring iv antibiotic therapy, number of days on iv antibiotic therapy 
for pulmonary exacerbation, and time-to-first antibiotic therapy  for pulmonary exacerbation. Additional 
nutritional status endpoints were: absolute change from baseline in weight and in BMI for age-z-score at 
week 24, and absolute change from baseline in weight z-score, height z-score, and height at week 24 
Sample size 
The study sample size was calculated assuming an absolute change in ppFEV1 of 5% with a standard 
deviation of 8% for a study with 99% power to detect a 5% change between treatment arms at the 0.025 
significance level from a study assuming a 10% drop-out rate. A total sample size of 501 subjects (167 
subjects for each treatment group) had approximately 99% power to detect a treatment difference of 5 
percentage points in absolute change of percent predicted FEV1 between either dose of lumacaftor in 
combination with ivacaftor compared with placebo. The study had approximately 98% power to detect a 
treatment difference of 6% in relative change of percent predicted FEV1 between each active treatment 
group and the placebo group at the 0.025 level of significance. This was based on the assumption of 
having a relative change in percent predicted FEV1 of 6 for the active treatment groups, an associated SD 
of 12%, and a sample size of 167 subjects for each treatment group (active and placebo). The assumed 
mean absolute/relative changes and SD were based on results from an ongoing Phase 2 study, Study 102. 
The power calculation was based on simulation using Splus with a 2-sided t-test for data sampled from 
the normal distribution. 
Treatments/ Objectives 
The Treatment Period lasted approximately 24 weeks. Subjects were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment 
groups: 2 combination treatment groups and 1 placebo group. The dosing regimen for each treatment 
group was as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
LUM 600 mg qd/IVA 250 mg q12h 
LUM 400 mg q12h/IVA 250 mg q12h 
LUM placebo q12h/IVA placebo q12h (placebo) 
Study drug was to be administered within 30 minutes of consumption of fat-containing food such as a 
standard “CF” high-fat, high-calorie meal or snack.   
Randomisation 
Subjects who met eligibility criteria were randomized (1:1:1) to 1 of 3 treatment groups. Randomization 
was stratified by age (<18 versus ≥18 years old), sex (male versus female), and percent predicted FEV1 
severity collected at the Screening Visit (<70 versus ≥70). An interactive web response system (IWRS) 
was used to assign subjects to treatment. 
Blinding (masking) 
Subjects and all site personnel, including the investigator, the site monitor, and the study team, were 
blinded, with exception of staff acting in emergency situation to ensure safety of the patients. Subjects 
and their caregivers were not to be informed of their study-related spirometry results during the 
Treatment Period even if the subject prematurely discontinued study drug treatment. 
Statistical methods 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS), including all subjects who were randomised and received any amount of study 
drug, was used for all efficacy analyses. The primary efficacy endpoint was the absolute change from 
Assessment report

baseline in percent predicted FEV1 at Week 24, assessed as the average treatment effect at Week 16 and 
at Week 24. The primary analysis for this endpoint was based on a mixed-effects model for repeated 
measures (MMRM).

Recruitment 
Study VX12-809-103: The study was initiated on 28 May 2013 and completed on 29 April 2014. 
Study VX12-809-104: The study was initiated on 11 April 2013 and completed on 25 April 2014. 
Conduct of the study 
In both studies, the total number of patients discontinuing from the study is small and the number of 
patients discontinuing treatment was also small in both studies. The discontinuations were much lower

than the anticipated 10% drop-out rate. This low rate of drop-outs further enhances the power of the 
study to reliably detect a smaller than anticipated treatment effect. The number of drop-outs are higher 
in the treatment groups (4.9-6.0%) as compared to the placebo group (2.2 to 2.7) in the two studies, 
which suggests that overall the drop-out due to lack of efficacy is negligible in the studies including in the 
placebo group. Most of the drop-outs have been to adverse events. 
Baseline data 
The baseline data in both studies were generally balanced across treatment arms. However the 
percentage of patients receiving inhaled antibiotics was 66.3% in placebo, 59.6% in lum 600mg qd/iva 
250 mg bd and 62.1% in lum 400mg bd/iva 250 mg bd in study 103. In study 104, this was 72.7% in 
placebo, 66.5% in lum 600mg qd/ iva 250 mg bd and 59.9% in lum 400mg bd/iva 250 mg bd. As the 
definition of pulmonary exacerbation, a key secondary endpoint depends on the change in antibiotics, the 
higher use of antibiotics at baseline may suggest a population of higher risk of exacerbations. It is 
observed that the number of patients on inhaled antibiotics is relatively larger in the placebo group as 
compared to the treatment groups in both the studies. Further it is noted that in study 104, the baseline 
use of inhaled antibiotics was lowest in the lum 400mg bd/iva 250mg bd. It is possible that higher level 
of baseline antibiotic use reflects a patient population who are at higher risk of infection and subsequent 
risk of exacerbations. However as the applicant pointed out, the higher use of antibiotics in a particular 
treatment arm could also result in lesser number of exacerbations in that arm. It is agreed that a 
definitive conclusion cannot be made on the way this small imbalance in baseline use of antibiotics can 
impact on the observed results. 
Numbers analysed 
Study VX12-809-103: Approximately 501 subjects were planned to be randomized (167 subjects in each

In both, the individual studies and the pooled analysis, improvements in absolute change in percent 
predicted FEV1 were rapid in onset as shown in the figure below. Significant treatment differences in the 
absolute change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 were detected for both dosing regimens by Day 
15 (the first post-baseline time point assessment; P≤0.0003) and were sustained at each subsequent 
visit.

Studies 103 and 104: Absolute Change From Baseline in Present Predicted EFV1 at Each Visit, 
Full Analysis Set 
The number of pulmonary exacerbations through Week 24 was a key secondary endpoint. In both studies, 
treatment with lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor substantially decreased the number, duration, 
and risk of pulmonary exacerbations, including severe pulmonary exacerbations requiring 
hospitalizations or IV antibiotic therapy. Time-to-first pulmonary exacerbation through Week 24 and the 
event of having at least 1 pulmonary exacerbation through Week 24 was a secondary endpoint which is 
a clinically relevant endpoint. In both Studies 103 and 104, the risk of a pulmonary exacerbation was 
lower in both active treatment groups compared to the placebo group, and favoured the LUM 400 mg 
q12h/IVA 250 mg q12h group in both studies. 
The following figures depict the change from baseline in BMI and BMI Z-score in the individual studies and 
the pooled data. Of note, the clinical relevance of the increase in BMI has not been discussed taking into 
account what is known about the correlation between BMI and FEV1.

clinical  relevance  of  the  noted  increase  in  BMI  changes  in  terms  of  lung  function  and  overall  patient 
benefit remains largely unknown.

The  Change  from  baseline  of  Predicted  FEV1  at  Week  24  has  been  calculated  using  the 
Average of Week 16 and Week 24. This choice is not shared either from a regulatory point of 
view or from a statistical prospective. The Applicant declared that the statistical rationale for 
the change was to “reduce variability compared with point estimate at week 24 alone”. This 
rational is not supported because the chosen primary analysis method (MMRM) takes itself 
into  account  the  variability  trough  the  structure  of  the  covariance  matrix,  and  it  is  not 
considered appropriate to reduce it by time point averaging.

Analysis 
description 
The  primary  analysis  for  this  endpoint  was  based  on  a  mixed-effects  model  for  repeated 
measures  (MMRM).  The  model  included  absolute  change  from  baseline  in  ppFEV1   as  the 
dependent variable, treatment, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects, with 
adjustment for sex, age group at baseline, and ppFEV1 severity at Screening, and subject as 
a random effect. No imputation on missing data was done for the primary analysis using the 
MMRM.  Response,  defined  as  ≥3,  ≥5,  and  ≥10  percentage  point  increases  in  average 
absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 at Week 16 and at Week 24, was analysed using a 
2-sided  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  test.  The  primary  analysis  for  the  first  3  key  secondary 
endpoints was similar to the analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint. Response analyses, 
similar to those defined for the response of the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1, were 
performed for the response defined as ≥5% increase in average relative change from baseline 
in  ppFEV1  at  Week  16  and  at  Week  24.  Regression  analysis  for  a  negative  binomial 
distribution, with sex, age group at baseline, and ppFEV1 severity at Screening as covariates 
and the log of time spent in the study as the offset, was used for the treatment comparison for 
the number of pulmonary exacerbations.

The Change from baseline of Predicted FEV1 at Week 24 has been calculated using the Average 
of Week 16 and Week 24. This choice is not shared either from a regulatory point of view or 
from  a  statistical  prospective.  The  Applicant  declared  that  the  statistical  rationale  for  the 
change  was  to  “reduce  variability  compared  with  point  estimate  at  week  24  alone”.  This 
rational is not supported because the chosen primary analysis method (MMRM) takes itself into 
account the variability trough the structure of the covariance matrix, and it is not considered 
appropriate to reduce it by time point averaging. 
The  primary  analysis  for  this  endpoint  was  based  on  a  mixed-effects  model  for  repeated 
measures  (MMRM).  The  model  included  absolute  change  from  baseline  in  ppFEV1   as  the 
dependent variable, treatment, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects, with 
adjustment for sex, age group at baseline, and ppFEV1 severity at Screening, and subject as a 
random effect. No imputation on missing data was done for the primary analysis using the 
MMRM.  Response,  defined  as  ≥3,  ≥5,  and  ≥10  percentage  point  increases  in  average 
absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 at Week 16 and at Week 24, was analysed using a 
2-sided  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  test.  The  primary  analysis  for  the  first  3  key  secondary 
endpoints was similar to the analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint. Response analyses, 
similar to those defined for the response of the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1, were 
performed for the response defined as ≥5% increase in average relative change from baseline 
in ppFEV1 at Week 16 and at Week 24. Regression analysis for a negative binomial distribution, 
with sex, age group at baseline, and ppFEV1 severity at Screening as covariates and the log of 
time spent in the study as the offset, was used for the treatment comparison for the number of 
pulmonary exacerbations. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
This dossier is supported by two pivotal studies (103 and 104) which recruited a similar patient population 
of CF patients aged 12 years and above who are homozygous with F508del -CFTR. No additional studies 
in sub-group of patients have been conducted. However, the applicant has conducted a sub-group 
analysis of the results from the pivotal studies to compare the extent of effects in different sub-groups. 
The results of the primary endpoint and other endpoints were generally consistent in the different 
sub-groups. An analysis based on age, sex, baseline disease severity and prior medication use did not 
show any significant treatment-by-subpopulation interaction. The overall results of the study were not 
driven by a pre-dominant response in any of the analysed sub-groups. This is reassuring and indicates the 
results of the studies are equally applicable to all the sub-groups in the population (see table below).

Efficacy in adolescent subjects 12 to 17 years of age 
In the 2 pivotal studies 103 and 104, 290 CF adolescent were included. Efficacy results in this patient 
population mirrored results obtained in adults. In the supportive study 011, examining the efficacy and 
safety of in subjects 6 through 11 years of age, an abrupt decline in ppFEV1 in 9 of 10 subjects was 
observed 4 hours post-dose. Overall, the mean ppFEV1 returned to near baseline by day 7 and was

approximately 3 percentage points above baseline at the Safety Follow-up Visit. A similar pattern was 
observed for ppFVC and ppFEF25%-75%. This drug-induced decrease in ppFEV1 was not expected as no 
evidence of such an effect was derived from the adult population of CF patients treated with the 
combination therapy. The mechanism underlying this effect will be investigated by the applicant in the 
future.  
Subjects with ppFEV1 less than 40  
Subjects with ppFEV1 less than 40 at screening were in general excluded from both studies. However, a 
total of 81 subjects (35 subjects in Study 103 and 46 subjects in Study 104) had a ppFEV1 less than 40 
at baseline. The majority of these subjects completed treatment. Within this subpopulation, there was a 
higher percentage of females in both active treatment groups than in the placebo group. Mean baseline 
BMI and ppFEV1 were similar across all 3 treatment groups. There were some differences between 
treatment groups with respect to prior use of some CF-related medications; however, these were not 
significant. Subjects with baseline ppFEV1 less than 40 had absolute improvements in ppFEV1 that 
ranged from 3.30 to 3.70 percentage points which were comparable to the improvements observed in 
subjects with baseline percent predicted FEV1 of 40 or greater. Consistent with the improvements in 
ppFEV1, reductions in the number of pulmonary exacerbations and increases in BMI were also observed 
in subjects with baseline ppFEV1 less than 40 who received active treatment than in those who received 
placebo.  
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses AND meta-analysis) 
The results of the analyses of the pooled data from both the pivotal studies (103 and 104) have been 
presented  above  under  the  summary  of  main  efficacy  results.  The  applicant  provided  the  results  of 
studies 103 and 104 based on baseline severity of lung function. These results are presented in the table 
below. 
Assessment report  
EMA/686121/2018 
Page 67/104 
 
 
 
A significant proportion of subjects had a baseline lung function ppFEV1 of < 75% and therefore, both the 
subgroups of >75% and >85% have smaller sample sizes. This is along the expected lines in that patients 
with  CFTR-508del  have  severe  disease.  Nevertheless,  it  is  seen  that  generally  the  direction  of  the 
parameters in primary and secondary endpoints support a treatment effect. A cross- study analysis shows 
that the treatment effects are consistent across both studies. For the proposed dose of lum 400mg bd/iva 
250mg bd, the effects on the primary endpoint was better in study 104 as compared to study 103, but 
nevertheless, in both studies, a statistically significant superiority over placebo was demonstrated on the 
primary  endpoint.  The  effects  of  the  proposed  dose  on  exacerbations  were  better  in  study  104  as 
compared to study 103, although both studies showed a clear superiority over placebo. The results on 
parameters of gastro-intestinal disease/nutrition (weight and BMI) were statistically significant in study 
104, whereas the results were numerically superior in study 103.  
Regarding the clinical endpoints of pulmonary exacerbations, both studies showed a significant/at least a 
numerically superior effect in favour of the active treatments. This was seen in all related endpoints. The 
analysis of the pooled results therefore consistently favours active treatments over placebo on all the 
primary and secondary endpoints. Thus, the two pivotal studies provide replicating evidence of efficacy 
for the combination of lum/iva.  
It  is  also  noted  that  the  overall  treatment  effect  size  on  the  primary  endpoint  is  small.  A  substantial 
proportion  of  patients  (>50%)  in  both  the  studies  and  with  both  dose-regimens  had  a  less  than  5% 
improvement in ppFEV1. Given that the treatment effects on FEV1 are seen as early as 15 days within 
Assessment report

treatment, the applicant was requested to discuss the possibility of identifying non-responders early and 
develop robust treatment stopping criteria to prevent unnecessarily treating patients who may not get 
sufficient benefit. In response, the applicant asserts that the observed results on FEV1 are distributed 
across all sub-groups irrespective of the baseline lung function. Furthermore, the applicant asserts that 
sub-group analyses have showed that patients had benefits on exacerbations even when there were no 
observed  effects  on  lung  function,  based  on  the  results  of  the  below  sub-group  analyses.  Indeed, 
compared to placebo, LUM/IVA combination therapy substantially decreased the number of pulmonary 
exacerbations, including severe pulmonary exacerbations requiring hospitalizations and/or IV antibiotics, 
regardless of whether there was an improvement in ppFEV1 at Day 15. Based on the above analyses, it 
is agreed that it is not appropriate to select non-responders based on early effects on lung function.  
The consistent numerical advantage for the LUM/IVA 400/250mg BD dose-regimen as compared to the 
LUM  600mg  OD/IVA  250mg  BD  on  pulmonary  exacerbations  across  studies 103,  104  and  105  is also 
acknowledged. There were no specific safety concerns in the LUM/IVA 400/250 mg BD dose-regimen as 
compared to the LUM 600mg OD/IVA 250mg BD regimen. From a safety perspective, only the off-target 
broncho-constriction effect of lumacaftor may be amenable to dose-titration. However, there is no clinical 
data to support such dose-titration and in any case, this safety event was not significant to result in any 
substantial  discontinuations  even  at  the  LUM  400mg  bd  dose-level.  Therefore  the  proposed  BD  dose 
regimen which is also convenient, can be accepted based on the currently available data. 
Supportive study 
Study VX12-809-105 (105) is an ongoing Phase 3, parallel-group, multicenter, 2-part, rollover study in 
subjects with CF who are homozygous or heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation and who 
participated in Study 103, Study 104, or Cohort 4 of Study 102. Study 105 is designed to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of long-term treatment of lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor. The schematic 
design of the study is presented in the figure below.

Part A Treatment Cohort: Subjects from study 103 or 104 who received active treatment in the 
parent studies continued to receive the same dose-regimen in study 105. Subjects who received 
placebo in the parent studies were randomized 1:1 to either lum 600mg od/iva 250mg bd or lum

Part A Observational Cohort: Subjects who met the study criteria for study 105 and who received 
at least 4 weeks of study drug in Study 103 or Study 104 and who either were not eligible for the 
Part A Treatment Cohort or chose not to continue treatment with lumacaftor in combination with 
ivacaftor were eligible for the Part A Observational Cohort. Subjects in the Part A Observational 
Cohort did not receive study drug. 
Part  B  Treatment  Cohort:  subjects  who  were  receiving  study  drug  treatment  at  the  end  of 
treatment in Cohort 4 of Study 102 were enrolled in to the cohort and received lum 400mg bd/iva

A planned interim safety analysis was performed after 194 subjects who had received active drug in 
Studies 103 and 104 completed the Week 24 Visit in Study 105; ad hoc efficacy analyses were also 
performed at the time of this planned interim analysis. The results on ppFEV1 in study 105 are shown in

Study 105: Absolute Change From Baseline in Present Predicted FEV1 at Each Visit, Part A 
Cumulative Period, Full Analysis Set 
The interim analysis from study 105 provides evidence on long-term maintenance of efficacy and safety; 
i.e. treatment effects after 48 weeks of treatment with the combination, where for the first 24 weeks 
there is parallel placebo treatment group for comparison and for the second 24 weeks it is uncontrolled. 
In subjects who were on placebo in the previous study and then randomized to active treatment in this 
study, it was seen that patients had treatment benefit within 15 days of starting treatment and this was 
generally maintained up to week 24 of treatment in the lum 400mg bd/iva 250mg bd. The extent of 
benefit in the treatment groups who were initially on placebo in the parent studies seems broadly

comparable to the benefit obtained by patients who started active treatment in the parent studies. This 
provides further evidence of the efficacy of the combination.  
Second Interim analysis of study 105 
A planned interim analysis was performed after all subjects in the Part A Treatment Cohort (Studies 103 
and  104)  completed  the  Week  24  Visit  in  Study  105  and  all  subjects  in  the  Part  B  Treatment  Cohort 
(Cohort 4 of Study 102) completed the Week 16 Visit in Study 105. Efficacy analysis in Part A included 
1029 subjects in the full analysis set. Data for 48 weeks of treatment with LUM/IVA combination therapy 
were available for 629 subjects who were assigned to 24 weeks of active treatment in Studies 103 or 104 
followed by 24 weeks of active treatment in Study 105. The rapid and sustained improvements in percent 
predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV1) observed in the groups treated with LUM/IVA 
combination therapy for 24 weeks in studies 103 and 104 were durable after an additional 24 weeks of 
LUM/IVA combination therapy in study 105 for a total of 48 weeks of active treatment. The groups treated 
with LUM/IVA combination therapy for 24 weeks in studies 103 and 104 improved also in BMI, weight, and 
Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) respiratory domain scores that were durable through an 
additional 24 weeks of active treatment in Study 105. For the groups that received LUM/IVA combination 
therapy in Studies 103 and 104, the annualized rate of pulmonary exacerbations remained lower in both 
groups  than  placebo  treatment  in  the  previous  studies  after  an  additional  24  weeks  of  LUM/IVA 
combination  therapy  in  Study  105.  Importantly,  the  annualized  rate  of  pulmonary  exacerbations  that 
required hospitalization and the raw annualized rate of pulmonary exacerbations requiring IV antibiotic 
therapy remained lower in both groups than placebo treatment in the previous studies. The overall small 
effect  size  on  lung  function  has  been  discussed  by  the  applicant  using  a  model  built  on  the  above 
long-term data. Results show that LUM/IVA decreased the rate of ppFEV1 decline compared with placebo. 
Given the duration of observation to date, the lack of statistical significance is not unexpected. Although 
the  difference  between  the  LUM/IVA  and  placebo  rates  of  decline  is  not  yet  statistically  significant,  a 
treatment effect is clearly evident.  
It is noted that the rate of decline in the placebo-treated patient is lower from that observed from registry 
populations  of  patients  homozygous  for  F508del.  The  applicant  argued  that  this  could  lead  to  an 
underestimation  of  treatment  effect.  However,  differences  in  the  rate  of  decline  may  well  relate  to 
differences in disease severity and aggressiveness because of the variable presence and combination of 
risk  factors  in  different  patient  subpopulations.  It  is  unknown  if  treatment  effect  would  be  similar  in 
patient  populations  with  faster  rates  of  decline  in  lung  function.  The  applicant  provided  a  sub-group 
analysis in patients on placebo in study 103/104 and who had a more than 2 percentage points decline in 
ppFEV1 (n=35) and more than 5 percentage points decline in ppFEV1  (n=7). Although arbitrary, this 
definition may be considered acceptable even if it does not take into account other parameters indicative 
of  rapidly  progressive  pulmonary  disease  related  to  patient-specific  changes,  such  as  the  rate  of 
pulmonary  exacerbations,  intermittent  infections  or  onset  of  CFRD.  Results  from  this  analysis  show 
comparable efficacy of LUM/IVA treatment in the different subgroups of patients, including those with 
more than 10% annual decline in ppFEV1. However, due to the small number of patients who can be thus 
defined as rapidly progressive, the inferences drawn are not robust. A reliable evaluation of the activity of 
LUM/IVA in patients with rapidly progressive pulmonary disease is possible only in the post-marketing 
setting.  
To  evaluate  the  consistency  in  effects,  the  applicant  was  requested  to  provide  a  comparison  of  the 
exacerbation data for the first 24 weeks (in study 103 and 104) with exacerbation data in second 24 
weeks (in study 105) for patients who had started active treatment in study 103/014. This analysis was 
provided by the applicant as below. 
Assessment report  
EMA/686121/2018 
Page 72/104 
 
 
 
These results compared to the placebo treatment period showed these patients had a reduced rate of 
pulmonary exacerbations during LUM/IVA treatment in Study 105, and the event rates during Study 105 
were  comparable  to  those  of  patients  treated  with  24  weeks  of  LUM/IVA  in  Studies  103/104 
demonstrating maintenance of effects.  
In relation to the query on the potential impact of the imbalances in antibiotic use between the treatment 
arms on the outcomes, the applicant's response addressed the use of both inhaled and oral antibiotics. It 
was seen that the use of antibiotics was generally higher in the placebo group as compared to the active 
treatment arms. This would have probably biased the results against treatment, if at all this had an effect. 
The applicant was also requested to provide and discuss a cross-study comparison of the observed effects 
with LUM/IVA as compared to the effects for other treatments currently used in this patient population as 
evidenced  in  published  literature  to  provide  a  comparative  perspective  of  the  treatment  effect  size. 
Although    the  comparisons  are  not  robust,  it  can  be  seen  that  the  treatment  effects  of  LUM/IVA  is 
comparable to other treatments authorised in cystic fibrosis. Moreover these effects were observed in 
addition to the effects of standard of care. Hence, this in general supports the clinical relevance of the 
observed results. However for a disease-modifying therapy, these effects are small and the treatment 
needs to be taken continuously for life. This can only be justified if there is a meaningful alteration in the 
disease progression by reducing the slope of deterioration in lung/organ function. In this context, the 
CHMP considers that data on the maintenance of treatment effect over time (long-term efficacy beyond 1 
year) can be provided in the post-authorisation setting. The study 105 is ongoing and the applicant is 
committed to provide clinical data of 120 weeks of treatment from this study as described in the RMP. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Two pivotal studies (study 103 and study 104) have been conducted in support of the use of Orkambi. 
Both were similar and were randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies. CF patients aged 12 
years  and  above  who  were  homozygous  for  F508del-CFTR  were  enrolled.  The  Applicant  justified  the 
inclusion of paediatric patients aged 12 years and older in the pivotal studies because they are expected 
to have similar levels of disease activity as adults, the same clinical end-points are established for both 
adolescents and adults with CF, and because extrapolation of dose from adults is possible for this age 
group. This is acceptable in principle, although it is noted that age is a key determinant in the evaluation 
of disease severity and consequently treatment benefit. As such, the interpretation of efficacy data in 
adolescents needs to take into account the more complex clinical picture of the disease at this age.  
Assessment report  
EMA/686121/2018 
Page 73/104 
 
 
 
 
The studies have the same design, including a Screening Period, a Treatment Period of 24 weeks, and a 
Safety Follow-up of additional 4 weeks, which is in line with the relevant CHMP guideline and is considered 
in general adequate to the evaluation of treatment effect in the claimed indication. However, both pivotal 
trials included a very large number of study sites located in North America, Europe and Australia. Thus 
only  a  small  proportion  of  potentially  eligible  patients  could  have  been  enrolled  at  each  site,  which 
hypothetically could have introduced bias in enrolment. The subgroup analysis differentiating between 
US, EU and Australian centres was not considered adequate to the CHMP to reveal potential recruitment 
bias, and additional subgroup analysis stratified by quartiles of proportions of randomized patients out of 
screened patients has been requested and it was reassuring the see that the treatment effect in both 
treatment arms does not seem to be driven by study sites with a low percentage of randomized patients.  
The  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  allow  the  enrolment  of  a  patient  population  that  adequately 
represents  the  target  patient  population  of  the  sought  indication.  Genotyping  was  performed  using  a 
validated CF genotyping test. Similar to that selected in the Kalydeco dossier, enrolment was limited to 
subjects with a FEV1> 40 and < 90 percent of predicted normal for age, sex and height at screening. This 
corresponds  to  patients  with  moderate-severe  lung  disease  who  on  the  basis  of  what  is  known  for 
ivacaftor are more likely to respond to treatment. Subjects were kept on their prescribed CF therapies for 
the  entire  study  duration.  Therefore,  the  combination  of  LUM/IVA  was  added  to  the  usual  patient 
background regimen. Standardization of concomitant therapy does not seem to have been done. As a 
consequence, results should be interpreted with caution sharp-cutting the background regimen.

The  Guideline  on  Clinical  Development  of  Medicinal  Products  for  the  Treatment  of  Cystic  Fibrosis 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/9147/2008-corr*)  recommends  “at  least  a  6-month  clinical  primary  endpoint 
assessing the respiratory function through FEV1 measurement”, and further specifies that “the time-point 
for  the  clinical  endpoint  should  allow  concluding  on  the  long-term  benefit  for  patients”.  The  primary 
endpoint  selected  for  both  103  and  104  studies  differs  from  what  is  recommended  in  the  guideline 
because it is assessed by the average change at Week 16 and Week 24, and not, as requested, at week 
24.  Absolute  changes  from  baseline  in  ppFEV1  at week  2,  4,  8,  16  and  24  have  been  included  as  an 
additional analysis. For the evaluation of treatment effect absolute changes from baseline in ppFEV1 at 
week 24 will be considered as the most reliable efficacy data and this has also been reflected in the SmPC 
of Orkambi.  
Crucial for the correct interpretation of the ppFEV1 endpoint is effective standardization of spirometry.  At 
the investigation site, spirometry was performed pre-bronchodilator and before dosing, according to the 
American  Thoracic  Society  Guidelines.    In  particular,  patients  who  were  on  SABA  or  SAMA,  were 
withdrawn from bronchodilators 4 hours before the spirometry assessment; whereas patients on LABA or 
LAMA  withheld  bronchodilator  12  hours  or  24  hours  before  treatment,  as  appropriate.  However,  if 
patients 
forgot 
to  withhold  bronchodilators  before  spirometry,  spirometry  was  performed 
post-bronchodilator. The applicant has provided analyses to show that not withholding bronchodilators 
before spirometry would not significantly affect the conclusions of the study, which is re-assuring.  
In addition, evidence from Studies 102, 008 and 009 showed a decline in FEV1 4 hours post-dose. No 
information  is  provided  for  studies  103  and  104,  with  the  exception  of  1  adolescent  patient  who 
discontinued  treatment  due  to  FEV1  decrease.  The  Applicant  clarified  that  there  were  no  acute 
assessments on FEV1 immediately after dosing in study 103 and 104. The actual assessments show that 
there was a beneficial effect of treatment on FEV1 within 15 days of treatment initiation and the number 
of withdrawals in these long-term studies is small, which suggests that this decline in post-dose FEV1 was 
not a significant concern. While this is accepted, the applicant took in to consideration that in practice, 
patients who are in exacerbation/poor and unstable lung function may be initiated on therapy. The SmPC 
Assessment report  
EMA/686121/2018 
Page 74/104 
 
 
advises that there is no experience of initiating treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor in patients having a 
pulmonary exacerbation and this is not advisable. This is considered appropriate by the CHMP. 
Key secondary endpoints 
Five key ranked-secondary endpoints were selected in both pivotal trials and the CHMP considered them 
important  read-outs of  treatment  effect.  From  a  clinical  point  of  view  the  most  important  endpoint  is 
recurrent  pulmonary  exacerbations  which  is  associated  with  long-term  decline  in  lung  function  and 
shortened survival; BMI is also considered of relevance since it is an index of patient nutritional status 
that is severely affected in CF. Because lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor targets the underlying 
defect in CF, an endpoint that allows to monitor the systemic clinical benefit of the combination therapy 
is important in order to evaluate treatment benefit. The responder analysis is also considered key for the 
interpretation  of  treatment  efficacy.  Patient  perception  of  treatment-induced  clinical  benefit  was 
monitored by CFQ-R respiratory domain score, which is a validated tool investigating cough during the 
day and night, the presence of mucus, and the ease of breathing. A difference of at least 4 points in the 
CFQ-R respiratory domain score, has been assumed as the minimal clinical important difference (MCID); 
this is considered acceptable as it is supported by literature evidence. No endpoint directly demonstrating 
on-target activity of the combination therapy (e.g. measurement of sweat chloride concentration) has 
been included in the pivotal studies. The applicant justified this exclusion stating that the primary aim of 
the pivotal trials was the demonstration of a clinically sustained benefit, whereas evaluation of drug effect 
on target was limited to the phase 2 studies, which included sweat chloride measurements. Measurement 
of sweat chloride is affected by high intra-patient variability which needs to be taken into account by 
comparing study results with previous determinations in the same patient.  
Two dosing regimens of the combination were evaluated: lum 600mg qd/iva 250mg bd and lum 400mg 
bd/iva 250 mg bd. This was based on the results of study 102. In both regimens the dosage of lumacaftor 
was  higher  than  that  approved  for  the  monotherapy  (i.e.  150  mg  q12h)  because  of  the  observed 
reduction in ivacaftor exposure when administered in combination with the CYP3A inducer lumacaftor. 
Treatment duration was 24 weeks, which is adequate. On the basis of PK data, Orkambi was administered 
with high-fat, high-calorie meal as the fed state increases the systemic exposure. This is reflected in the 
SmPC. 
The  pivotal  studies  used  a  placebo  comparison  and  did  not  include  a  lumacaftor  alone  treatment 
comparison. For the rational use of a fixed dose combination it is necessary to show that the combination 
is  better  than  the  relevant  monotherapies.  As  lumacaftor  monotherapy  was  not  fully  characterised  in 
phase  2  setting,  the  lack  of  monotherapy  comparator  was  an  issue.  However,  in  this  instance  where 
LUM/IVA  is  targeted  at  an  orphan  indication  and  where  treatment  benefit  is  demonstrated  on  top  of 
standard of care, the limited data on short term clinically relevant benefit on lung function from phase 2 
study is accepted by the CHMP. 
The power of the studies, with the selected sample size of 501 patients, is > 99.9%. Indeed less than 60 
pts  per  arm  would  have  sufficed  to  detect  a  treatment  difference  of  5  percentage  points  in  absolute 
change of percent predicted FEV1 between study arms with a power of 90%. The studies thus have a large 
sample  size.  In  addition,  considering  that  the  final  randomized  population  is  larger  than  planned  and 
consist of 559 and 563 patients in study 103 and 104, respectively, the demonstration of a statistically 
significant effect is not of much value unless the effect size can be justified to be clinically relevant. When 
the  population  of  the  2  studies  is  pooled  a  total  of  1108  pts  are  analyzed  to  produce  overall  efficacy 
estimates.  Clinically  irrelevant  differences  between  treatment  doses  and  placebo  will  thus  result  as 
statistical significant, negatively impacting on the interpretation of study results in terms of p values. 
However this sample size is justified based on the need to adequately characterise the safety profile of the 
combination.

A  mixed-effects  model  for  repeated  measures  (MMRM)  was  used  as  the  primary  analysis  method  to 
determine  the  treatment  effects.  A  hierarchical  testing  procedure  was  used  for  the  primary  and  key 
secondary endpoints at α = 0.0250 for each active treatment arm separately. At each step, the test for 
treatment effect was considered statistically significant if the p value was ≤0.0250, and all previous tests 
also met this level of significance. For endpoints on ppFEV1, the change from baseline to week 24 was 
calculated as an average of week 16 and week 24. This is not truly reflective of a treatment effect after 6 
months of treatment and so the applicant was requested to provide analysis based on observations at 
week 24 alone. Hence, as requested by the CHMP, the applicant agreed to present the change at week 24 
data for spirometric values in the SmPC.  
Overall, the proposed two studies provide replicated evidence on the treatment effects of the combination 
in the intended target population on clinically relevant parameters after adequate treatment duration. In 
addition,  for  further  evidence  on  long-term  safety  and  maintenance  of  efficacy,  the  applicant  has 
submitted the results of two interim analyses from an ongoing study (study 105) which enrolled patients 
who had completed phase 2/phase 3 studies of the combination.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Both the pivotal studies, study 103 and study 104 were positive and showed statistically significant 
superiority over placebo on the primary endpoint of mean absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 at 
week 24 in both lum 600mg qd/iva 250 mg bd (study 103 – 2.73%, p<0.0001; study 104 – 2.26%, 
p=0.0001) and lum 400mg bd/iva 250 mg bd (study 103 – 1.68%, p=0.005; study 104 – 2.63%, 
p<0.0001). Most of the treatment effect was already apparent at day 15, reached a peak at week 16, and 
slightly decreased at week 24. Treatment effect on the first key secondary endpoint, average relative 
change from baseline in ppFEV1, was consistent with results observed for the primary endpoint. The 
effects on secondary endpoints which included surrogate (spirometric), clinical (BMI, exacerbations) and 
patient reported outcomes (CFQ-R, TMSQ & EQ-5D-3L) were all consistently in favour of the active 
treatments (both doses) as compared to the placebo in both study 103 and 104 with many of them 
meeting statistical significance as well. On the clinical endpoints of pulmonary exacerbations, importantly 
robust reductions in the number, frequency, and duration of pulmonary exacerbations, including severe 
pulmonary exacerbations requiring hospitalization or IV antibiotic therapy, were also observed following 
treatment.  
At Week 24, in subjects treated at the proposed dose of lum 400mg bd/iva 250mg bd, the proportion of 
patients who remained free from pulmonary exacerbations was significantly higher as compared to 
placebo. In the pooled analysis, the rate ratio of exacerbations through Week 24 in subjects treated with 
lumacaftor 400 mg/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h; n = 369 was 0.61 (P<0.0001), representing a reduction 
relative to placebo of 39%. Treatment with lumacaftor 400 mg/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h significantly 
decreased the risk for exacerbations requiring hospitalisation vs. placebo by 61% (rate ratio=0.39, 
P<0.0001) and reduced exacerbations requiring treatment with intravenous antibiotics by 56% (rate 
ratio=0.44, P<0.0001). There is additional support from the long-term uncontrolled study (study 105) 
which shows that the efficacy seen at 24 weeks in study 103 and 104 was maintained up to week 48 in 
patients who continued on active in both study 103/104 and study 105. Patients on placebo in study 
103/104 who then received active treatments in study 105 also showed the same magnitude of benefit 
providing further evidence for the treatment effect of lum/iva.  
In the pivotal studies, the magnitude of treatment effect on the primary endpoint is smaller than the 5% 
difference on which the sample size calculations were based. Further, the statistical significance appears 
to be driven by the large sample size rather than a large effect size, and significance per se cannot be the 
only factor that supports the demonstration of efficacy. The analysis of responders further confirms the 
limited benefit of the combination therapy with only 30.8%-37% and 23-30% of patients in the two 
studies treated with the 600 mg LUM qb/IVA and 400 mg LUM q12h/IVA, respectively, showing an 
Assessment report

absolute gain in ppFEV1 over baseline of > 5%. Similar results are obtained when response to treatment 
is defined as >5% relative improvement in ppFEV1. Of note, there was a high rate of responders in the 
placebo groups, which may impact the interpretability of treatment effect.  
In Study 103, treatment effect failed to reach statistical significance over placebo for the second key 
secondary endpoint: changes in BMI, stopping the testing hierarchy at this endpoint for both active 
treatment groups. Treatment failure in increasing BMI was accompanied by similar not statistically 
significant results in absolute change in body weight and in BMI z-score at week 24. The applicant justifies 
the lack of a statistical significance effect on BMI with the observation that the placebo group showed a 
significant within-group improvement in BMI (0.19 kg/m2; P = 0.0065). Indeed, the fact that patients 
treated with placebo had significant increases in BMI indicates that fluctuations in this endpoint may be 
observed in the clinical course of the disease, challenging the interpretation of study results. In Study 
104, both dosing regimens of the combination therapy resulted in statistically significant increases in BMI 
over placebo. Results on BMI were mirrored by similar treatment effect on body weight at week 24. 
Analyses of absolute changes in body weight and in BMI z-score at week 24 yielded similar results. 
However, it is difficult to judge treatment effect on BMI without taking into consideration the changes in 
the nutritional risk at the single patient level in response to the improvement in BMI.  
An absolute difference of 30-40% in the number of pulmonary exacerbations was observed in the active 
treatment arms compared to placebo in both pivotal trials. These results are not statistically significant 
based on the hierarchical testing. The analysis of time-to-first pulmonary exacerbation through Week 24 
confirmed that a numerically greater proportion of subjects who received the LUM/IVA combination 
therapy remained free of pulmonary exacerbations compared with the proportion of subjects who 
received placebo. The rate of severe pulmonary exacerbations requiring hospitalization was also reduced 
in the active treatment arms compared to placebo. This was paralleled by and a lower number of 
pulmonary exacerbations requiring IV antibiotic therapy through Week 24. Although not outstanding, 
these overall results are considered of interest if maintained in the long-term.  
In the results of the pivotal studies, subgroup analyses were performed for the primary endpoint, by 
stratifying for demographic and baseline characteristics and for prior medication subgroups. No robust 
trends suggestive of meaningful differences between any of the subgroups were seen. Data on absolute 
ppFEV1 changes over baseline from the rollover study 105 seem to confirm maintenance of treatment 
effect up to a total of 48 weeks of therapy.  
In the first interim analysis, subjects randomized to placebo in studies 103 and 104 and receiving the 600 
mg LUM qd/IVA combination therapy showed a fall in response at week 24 of Study 105. The applicant 
interpreted these data with caution because of the small number of subjects included in the analysis (45 
pts treated with placebo/600 mg LUM qd/IVA). Of note, although of similar size, the correspondent 
treatment arm with the 400 mg LUM q12h/IVA did not show any decrease in treatment effect. In the 
second interim analysis, it is noted that subjects who were initially on placebo in study 103 and 104 and 
then rolled over to active treatments showed a beneficial effect on ppFEV1 in both dosing regimens. 
Furthermore, the evidence from study 105 suggests that patients who were on placebo in the parent 
study (103 or 104) achieved a similar magnitude of benefit as patients who had lum/iva through both 
parent and long-term extension studies. Hence, the treatment effect of the combination lum/iva could 
provide around 2% benefit on ppFEV1 and may not alter the slope of decline in FEV1. The applicant 
submitted additional data from second interim analysis of study 105. Although based on extrapolation, 
the applicant asserts that an effect on the slope of decline in FEV1 has been demonstrated. Another 
aspect of justifying the need for chronic treatment is the effect on exacerbations, which is of direct clinical 
relevance; a continued reduction in exacerbations throughout the treatment period was demonstrated, 
which is beneficial.  
Assessment report  
EMA/686121/2018 
Page 77/104 
 
 
Several  intervention  strategies  have  been  shown  to  reduce  the  number  of  acute  exacerbations  with 
comparable  efficacy  as  the  LUM/IVA  combination  therapy.  The  applicant  was  asked  to  discuss  the 
relevance of the potential benefit on the rate of exacerbation of the combination therapy in the context of 
the available armamentarium for the management of CF. This comparison showed that the treatment 
effect size of LUM/IVA was comparable to other authorised symptomatic treatments in CF. This is both, 
reassuring on the clinical relevance of the observed effect size, but questioned in that the effect size of a 
chronic  treatment  which  targets  disease  modification  is  only  comparable  to  other  symptomatic 
treatments.  Nevertheless,  considering  that  the  observed  benefits  are  in  addition  to  the  benefits  of 
standard of care, it is accepted that adequate evidence of clinically relevant and statistically significant 
effect on efficacy has been demonstrated. Given the overall limited magnitude of beneficial effect seen on 
the primary endpoint, a longer follow up period is required to provide additional conclusive evidence on 
the long-term efficacy. Hence, in study 105, the applicant should explore the possibility of a longer (i.e. 
5 years) follow up of the enrolled patients and provide results on the agreed efficacy and safety of this 
study population and report in PSURs as recommended by the CHMP. This will be forthcoming as study 
105 is ongoing. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Statistical Conclusions 
The results from both studies provide good evidence that both active combination arms are superior to 
placebo in terms of effects on FEV1 after 24 weeks of treatment. Additional analyses of change from 
baseline to week 24 using multiple imputation to account for missing data were supportive of the initial 
conclusions. The primary analysis presented estimates the average of the effect at Week 16 and 24. This 
estimate is slightly larger than the analysis of the change from baseline to Week 24, which is therefore 
considered to provide a better estimate of the likely long term efficacy of the combination and the 
applicant has accepted the recommendation to include these results in the SmPC, as required by the 
CHMP. 
Clinical conclusions 
A consistent and statistically significant treatment effect for both the dosing regimens of lumacaftor and 
ivacaftor combination therapy was shown on the primary endpoint of mean absolute change in ppFEV1 
from baseline at week 24. The onset of treatment effects was seen as early as 15 days after start of 
treatment. This effect was generally maintained for the study treatment period of 24 weeks. Further the 
long-term extension study showed that efficacy at 24 weeks, which was generally maintained up to 48 
weeks.  
Consistent support from PD data for the proposed mechanism is not available as the available PD data is 
limited. The added advantage of IVA in terms of a clinically relevant effect to the combination cannot be 
conclusively ascertained in the absence of comparison of the combination to lumacaftor monotherapy.  
However in the context of a disease modifying treatment, in an orphan condition where the benefits is on 
top of current standard of care, the available short-term data showing the added benefit of ivacaftor on 
lung function is accepted.  
The extent of effect seen (1.68%-2.63%) is lower than anticipated 5% change. This is also lower than the 
reported 10-12% improvement with the only disease modifying treatment that has been authorised - 
ivacaftor in G551D patients. This extent of effect is closer to symptomatic treatment. Clinical benefit from 
an accrued benefit in FEV1 expanding with time from a 2% baseline can be of significance. The rate of 
decline of FEV1 in the population enrolled in the pivotal studies appears slower than what is documented 
from registry.  Further the number of exacerbations is lower than in a general CF population and the 
number of patients who are considered to have rapidly progressive disease appears to be small in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/686121/2018 
Page 78/104 
 
 
study population. It is accepted that these are limitations that are expected in controlled clinical studies. 
Because of this limitation, the generalizability of the study results can be conclusively ascertained only in 
a post-marketing setting.  
The results on the key secondary endpoints and other secondary endpoints were supportive of the 
conclusion from the primary endpoint including significant effects on clinical outcome endpoints related to 
exacerbations. The effects on CFQ-R and BMI have not been consistently significant across the studies 
and are not in themselves indicative of a clinically relevant benefit of the treatment. An absolute 
difference of 30-40% in the number of pulmonary exacerbations was observed in the active treatment 
arms compared to placebo in both pivotal trials which is accepted as clinically meaningful effect. The 
analysis of time to first pulmonary exacerbation, rate of severe pulmonary exacerbations requiring 
hospitalization and rate of pulmonary exacerbations requiring IV antibiotic therapy were all supportive of 
a clinically relevant treatment effect. 
Taking the overall evidence, it is concluded that adequate evidence of a significant and clinically relevant 
effect on efficacy has been demonstrated. Given the low magnitude of observed effect on the primary 
endpoint further long-term data on the forthcoming from the ongoing study 105 will be submitted as 
described in the RMP. Furthermore the applicant has been asked to explore the possibility of a longer (i.e. 
5 years) follow up of the enrolled patients and provide results on the agreed efficacy and safety of this 
study population and report in PSURs. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety analysis includes all safety data available as of 21 July 2014 from 17 clinical studies with 
lumacaftor monotherapy or lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor. 
Overview of Studies (N=17) and Pooling in the safety data 
The core safety data are pooled analyses of 2 placebo-controlled Phase III studies of LUM/IVA in subjects 
with CF who are homozygous for the CFTR-F508del mutation. The supportive analysis includes pooled 
safety data from 9 Phase 1 studies (lumacaftor monotherapy and lumacaftor in combination with 
Assessment report  
EMA/686121/2018 
Page 79/104 
 
 
 
 
ivacaftor) in healthy subjects. Safety data from 6 individual Phase I and II studies are also included. Of 
the subjects who received at least 1 dose of LUM/IVA combination therapy in the pooled Phase III studies 
(103 and 104), 56.6% were in North America, 35.0% were in Europe, and 8.4% were in Australia. The 
majority of these subjects were White (98.2%), not Hispanic or Latino (96.3%), and 18 years of age or 
older (73.7%).The proportion of male subjects (50.7%) and female subjects (49.3%) was similar.  
The median age was 24 years in the LUM/IVA group and 23 years in the placebo group. Baseline disease 
characteristics show that the proportion of subjects distributed across the different ranges of percent 
predicted FEV1 were similar across the LUM/IVA and placebo groups. 
Patient exposure 
A total of 116 patients who had been exposed to lumacaftor/ivacaftor in the placebo-controlled Phase III 
studies (103 and 104) had completed the 24-week visit in Study 105 and had therefore been exposed to 
either dose of lumacaftor/ivacaftor for at least 48 weeks as of 21 July 2014. Hence, more than 100 
patients have been exposed to lumacaftor/ivacaftor combination therapy for at least 48 weeks in line with 
the guidelines on minimum exposure data for safety purposes of long-term therapy.

Adverse events 
Pooled placebo-controlled Phase III studies 
Nearly all subjects in the LUM/IVA (95.8%) and placebo (95.9%) groups had AEs. The incidence of AEs 
leading to study drug discontinuation was higher in the LUM/IVA group (4.2%) than the placebo group 
(1.6%). The incidence of adverse events leading to study drug interruption was 5.7% in the LUM/IVA 
group and 6.8% in the placebo group; see table below. The population enrolled in the Phase III studies 
had numerous concomitant morbidities and concomitant medications as is to be expected in patients with 
cystic fibrosis. Therefore assessment of causality of adverse events poses a particular problem in this 
population.

Note: When summarizing n (%) subjects, multiple events were counted only once in that category. 
a  
b  
For the calculation of the total number of events, subjects with multiple events within a category were counted multiple times in that category. 
Related adverse events include related, possibly related, and missing categories. 
The most common AEs (incidence of at least 15% in any treatment group) were infective pulmonary 
exacerbation of CF, cough, headache, and sputum increased. AEs with an incidence at least 3% higher in 
the total LUM/IVA group than the placebo group were dyspnoea (14.0% versus 7.8%), respiration 
abnormal (9.8% versus 5.9%), flatulence (6.0% versus 3.0%), and rash (5.6% versus 1.9%). AEs for 
which the incidence in the total LUM/IVA group was ≥5% and the difference in incidence was ≥1% higher 
compared with the placebo group were dyspnoea, diarrhoea, nausea, respiration abnormal, 
oropharyngeal pain, upper respiratory tract infection, flatulence, rhinitis, rash, rhinorrhoea, and 
vomiting. The number of subjects with AEs considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug 
was higher in the total LUM/IVA group (48.0%) compared with the placebo group (34.9%). The majority 
of AEs across all 3 treatment groups were mild or moderate in severity. An analysis of the incidence of AEs 
by 8-week intervals demonstrated that the onset of the majority of new adverse events was generally 
higher in the first 8 weeks of treatment in both the LUM/IVA and placebo groups. No adverse events 
increased in incidence more than 2% after the first 8 weeks. 
Phase I Studies in Healthy Volunteers 
Data from 9 Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers were pooled, regardless of study drug dose or 
treatment duration. Data were provided for all treatment groups: placebo, LUM monotherapy, ivacaftor 
monotherapy, lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor (LUM/IVA), and lumacaftor in combination with 
ivacaftor and a drug:drug interaction (DDI) drug (LUM/IVA DDI).

who had an adverse event, 1 subject (2.1%) had a severe adverse event (diarrhoea). No subjects in the 
LUM/IVA, LUM/IVA DDI, or placebo groups had a life-threatening adverse event. Of the 95 subjects in the 
LUM/IVA group who had an AE, 5 subjects (2.9%) had an adverse event considered to be related to study 
drug, and 52 subjects (30.1%) had an adverse event considered to be possibly related to study drug. Of 
the 27 subjects in the placebo group who had an AE, 3 subjects (6.4%) had an AE considered to be related 
to study drug, and 12 subjects (25.5%) had an AE considered to be possibly related to study drug. The 
most commonly reported AEs considered to be related or possibly related to study drug were diarrhoea, 
upper abdominal pain, increased liver transaminases, vomiting, headache and dyspnoea. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Pooled placebo-controlled Phase III studies 
There were no deaths during the placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies. One subject from the LUM 400 mg 
q12h/IVA 250 mg q12h group of study 103 (Subject XXXX) rolled over into study 105 and had an SAE 
(infective pulmonary exacerbation of cystic fibrosis) with fatal outcome approximately 1 year after 
starting study drug and 22 days after study drug was withdrawn due to the AE. This event was considered 
unrelated to study drug by the investigator. The incidence of SAEs was higher in the placebo (28.6%) 
group compared with the total LUM/IVA group (20.1%). The incidence of SAEs was lower in the LUM 400 
mg q12h/IVA 250 mg q12h group (17.3%) compared with the LUM 600 mg qd/ IVA 250 mg q12h group 
(22.8%). The most commonly reported SAE was infective pulmonary exacerbation of cystic fibrosis but 
the inverse dose response suggests that treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor may actually decrease the 
risk of an exacerbation of cystic fibrosis. The incidence of SAEs considered related to study drug was 
similar in the placebo (2.2%) and total LUM/IVA groups (3.0%). Related SAEs that occurred in 2 or more 
subjects overall were: blood creatinine phosphokinase increased (0.3% total LUM/IVA, 0% placebo), liver 
function test abnormal (0.3% total LUM/IVA, 0% placebo), bronchospasm (0.3% total LUM/IVA, 0% 
placebo), haemoptysis (0.3% total LUM/IVA, 0.5% placebo), infective pulmonary exacerbation of cystic

fibrosis (0.1% total LUM/IVA, 1.1% placebo), nephrolithiasis (0.3% total LUM/IVA, 0% placebo), and 
rash (0.3% total LUM/IVA, 0% placebo) 
Phase I Studies in Healthy Volunteers 
No deaths occurred in the pooled Phase 1 studies. Overall, 4 (1.3%) subjects had a Grade 3 or 4 AE. One 
subject (0.6%) in the LUM/IVA group and 1 subject (2.1%) in the placebo group had a severe AE of 
diarrhoea. Other Grade 3 or 4 AEs that occurred during the pooled Phase 1 studies were lipase increased 
and rhabdomyolysis. The only SAE thought to be related to study drug was rhabdomyolysis. 
Laboratory findings 
In general, there were few clinically relevant abnormal laboratory findings. There is a consistent elevation 
of liver enzymes in the active treatment arms in the Phase III studies and of creatinine phosphokinase. In 
the latter there appears to be a dose response element associated with lumacaftor with a higher 
percentage of patients in the lumacaftor 400mg q12h/ivacaftor 250mg q12h group (7.3%) than in the 
lumacaftor 600mg qd/ivacaftor 250mg q12h group (3.8%) reporting elevated creatinine phosphokinase. 
The reports of increased CPK were requested by the CHMP to be reviewed but no possible mechanism by 
which the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor might cause an increase in blood CPK has been found. 
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) 
Liver-related adverse events: Mild and moderate elevations in ALT and/or AST were observed in a small 
number of subjects in Phase I/II studies involving LUM/IVA. Such transaminase elevations were generally 
not progressive and were not associated with elevations in total bilirubin. Elevations in liver function test 
values were generally mild and transient. The majority of subjects in the LUM/IVA group had maximum 
ALT and AST levels of ≤3 × ULN. Only 2 subjects (1.2%) in the LUM/IVA group had maximum ALT or AST 
of >3 to ≤5 × ULN. In the Phase III studies the incidence of elevated transaminases or hepatobiliary 
disorder adverse events was similar in the total LUM/IVA group (5.7%) and the placebo group (5.4%). 
Within the active treatment groups, the incidence was similar between the LUM 600 mg qd/ IVA 250 mg 
q12h group (5.4%) and the LUM 400 mg q12h/IVA 250 mg q12h group (6.0%). The AESIs of elevated 
transaminases with the highest overall incidence were ALT increased (1.9% in the total LUM/IVA group 
and 2.4% in the placebo group) and AST increased (2.0% in the total LUM/IVA group and 2.2% in the 
placebo group). 
The majority of elevated transaminases or hepatobiliary disorder adverse events were mild or moderate 
in severity. Five subjects in the total LUM/IVA group (3 subjects in the LUM 600 mg qd/IVA 250 mg q12h 
group and 2 subjects in the LUM 400 mg q12h/IVA 250 mg q12h group) and 1 subject in the placebo 
group had elevated transaminases or hepatobiliary disorder adverse events that were considered severe. 
Seven (7) subjects (0.9%) in the total LUM/IVA group (4 subjects in the LUM 600 mg qd/ IVA 250 mg 
q12h  and  3  subjects  in  the  LUM  400  mg  q12h/IVA  250  mg  q12h  group)  had  SAEs  of  elevated 
transaminases or hepatobiliary disorders. 
Raised transaminases were seen in patients in the placebo arm as well as in patients receiving LUM/IVA 
and there was only a small increase in incidence in raised transaminases in the active treatment arms. Of 
the seven patients who developed SAEs related to elevated transaminases of hepatobiliary events, in four 
cases the event resolved on stopping or interrupting treatment while in three the event did not resolve. 
Therefore there was no consistent positive de-challenge but a causal relationship between 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor and raised hepatic transaminases cannot be ruled out. This adverse event has been 
reflected in the SmPC of Orkambi. As a safety measure, monitoring of LFTs is advised before starting 
treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor and at regular intervals during treatment. 
Elevated creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) was noted in several subjects with increased transaminases, 
hence, a review of CPK and transaminases was performed. Overall, no clear difference between

transaminases and CPK in subjects receiving LUM/IVA compared with placebo was observed. In the 
pooled placebo-controlled Phase III studies, 5.4% of subjects in the placebo group and 5.6% of subjects 
in the total LUM/IVA group had an adverse event of blood CPK increased. The overall incidence of CPK >3 
× ULN to ≤10 × ULN and >10 × ULN was similar in the total LUM/IVA group (4.0% and 2.3%) compared 
with the placebo group (4.9% and 2.7%). Overall, 14 subjects with AST (>3 × ULN) also had marked CPK 
elevations (>10 × ULN), but the incidence was similar between the total LUM/IVA group (9 subjects 
[1.2%]) and placebo group (5 subjects [1.4%]). 
Respiratory adverse events: The most common AEs during the lumacaftor monotherapy and lumacaftor 
and ivacaftor combination therapy in study 102 were cough, CF lung, headache, productive cough, upper 
respiratory tract infection, nausea, haemoptysis, respiration abnormal, and dyspnoea. Respiration 
abnormal and dyspnoea occurred more commonly in subjects who received higher doses of lumacaftor 
monotherapy compared with lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor or placebo. These AEs were 
primarily observed within the first 3 days of lumacaftor monotherapy and were generally mild to 
moderate, resolving with continued dosing. 
In the Phase III studies, higher percentage of subjects had respiratory AESIs in the total LUM/IVA group 
(194 subjects [26.3%]) compared with the placebo group (63 subjects [17.0%]). The incidence of 
respiratory AESIs was similar in the LUM 600 mg qd/IVA 250 mg q12h group (26.8%) and LUM 400 mg 
q12h/ IVA 250 mg q12h group (25.7%). The AESI of respiratory symptoms with the highest overall 
incidence was dyspnoea (11.9%), which had a higher incidence in the total LUM/IVA group (14.0% 
[14.9% in the LUM 600 mg qd/IVA 250 mg q12h group and 13.0% in the LUM 400 mg q12h/IVA 250 mg 
q12h group]) compared with the placebo group (7.8%). In the extension study 105, a total of 141 
(13.7%) subjects had AESIs of respiratory symptoms. The incidence of AESIs of respiratory symptoms 
was higher in subjects who received placebo in the parent studies compared with subjects who received 
active treatment in the parent study. There is a consistent pattern across the Phase III studies of an 
increased incidence of dyspnoea and respiration abnormal (generally chest tightness or 
bronchospasm/wheezing) associated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor combination therapy when compared with 
placebo. This pattern is the same in subgroup analyses of age and severity of disease and was not 
mitigated by prior use of bronchodilators, which were used by over 95% of subjects. However there is no 
consistent pattern of an increased incidence in respiratory adverse events with increasing dose of 
lumacaftor in combinations with ivacaftor. The respiratory adverse events of dyspnoea and 
bronchospasm were generally mild to moderate in severity, appeared to be associated with initiation of 
treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor and, in the majority of subjects, did not require cessation of therapy. 
Ophthalmological effects: Due to the nonclinical finding of a dose-related increase in lens opacities in 
juvenile rats exposed to multiple doses of ivacaftor monotherapy, ophthalmologic examinations were 
conducted during the ivacaftor clinical development program. In the lumacaftor/ivacaftor development 
programme, ophthalmological examinations were conducted at screening in studies 103 and 104 in order 
to exclude patients with pre-existing cataracts. No follow-up examinations were conducted and therefore 
the development of cataracts following lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy is reliant on the reporting of AEs. The 
Applicant maintains that there is no evidence of a risk in humans, particularly in subjects aged 12 years 
and older as were the subjects enrolled in Studies 103 and 104. Lumacaftor/ivacaftor is not proposed to 
be licensed for use in children less than 12 years of age and the risk of cataract appears to be confined to 
this young age group. Cataract is addressed as an important potential risk in the RMP. 
Menstrual abnormalities: The data from the lumacaftor monotherapy and lumacaftor/ivacaftor 
combination clinical development programme strongly suggest that lumacaftor has an effect on hormonal 
contraceptive effectiveness; although there is also some suggestion that lumacaftor may have a direct 
effect on menstrual irregularities. A mechanism by which lumacaftor could directly affect menstruation is 
not known but it is biologically plausible that lumacaftor, as a strong CYP3A inducer, would reduce the 
effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Appropriate warnings have been included in the SmPC.

QTc prolongation: A thorough QT Study was performed to determine the effect of a therapeutic and a 
supratherapeutic dose of lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor on the QT/QTc interval. There is no 
evidence that lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor prolongs the QTc interval to a clinically relevant 
extent. The supratherapeutic dose used in this study gave an exposure to lumacaftor that is significantly 
higher than the exposure in patients with cystic fibrosis even in the presence of moderate hepatic 
impairment or if given concomitantly with CYP3A inhibitors. These results therefore give reassurance 
regarding the arrhythmic potential of lumacaftor/ivacaftor. 
Safety in special populations 
Age: In the pooled analysis of placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies, subgroup analyses of the incidence of 
adverse events were assessed by age group (subjects ≥18 years of age and subjects ≥12 to <18 years 
of age). Of the 1108 subjects who received study drug in the pooled, placebo-controlled Phase 3 program, 
290 subjects were aged ≥12 to <18 years of age. In general, the safety profile of the total LUM/IVA and 
placebo groups was similar in subjects ≥12 to <18 years of age and subjects ≥18 years of age. There are 
no safety issues that are peculiar to any age group. It is accepted that there are no data in the elderly 
population (>64 years) as cystic fibrosis leads to a shortened life expectancy. 
Gender: Approximately equal numbers of males and females were enrolled in the pooled 
placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies. The incidence of AEs was higher for females than for males in all 
treatment groups. However, the overall safety profile was similar for both sexes. AEs that were at least 
5% more common in females compared with males were infective pulmonary exacerbation of cystic 
fibrosis, cough, dyspnoea, sputum increased, and nausea. These events had an increased incidence in 
both the placebo and total LUM/IVA groups for females compared with males, so the increase in frequency 
is unlikely to be associated with LUM/IVA therapy, but rather suggests that these events are more 
common in females. Consistent with the overall trend for the pooled placebo-controlled Phase III analysis 
(males and females), there was a decreased incidence of infective pulmonary exacerbation of cystic 
fibrosis and cough for male or female subjects in the total LUM/IVA group compared with the placebo 
group. 
Percentage predicted FEV1 at baseline: The pooled placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies enrolled subjects 
with percent predicted FEV1 ≥40 and ≤90 of normal for age, sex, and height at screening. Subjects were 
stratified at randomization for percent predicted FEV1 <70 and ≥70 at screening. The range of percent 
predicted FEV1 at baseline was 31.1% to 96.5% in the total LUM/IVA group and 33.9% to 99.8% in the 
placebo group. To assess the impact of percent predicted FEV1 on safety, subgroup analyses were 
conducted to assess the safety of lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in subjects with percent 
predicted FEV1 <70 or ≥70 and in subjects with percent predicted FEV1 <40 at baseline. The majority of 
subjects enrolled in the pooled placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies had percent predicted FEV1 <70 at 
screening; there were no clinically meaningful differences in the pattern of AEs related to severity of lung 
disease at screening. 
Hepatic impairment (Study 010): Both lumacaftor and ivacaftor are mainly metabolised via the hepatic 
route. Lumacaftor is a strong inducer of CYP3A and ivacaftor is a substrate of CYP3A. Study 010 was 
conducted to assess the impact of moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) on the PK of lumacaftor 
and ivacaftor combination treatment. All 23 subjects enrolled received at least 1 dose of (LUM 200 mg 
q12h/IVA 250 mg q12h); 11 (91.7%) of the subjects with moderate hepatic impairment and 11 (100%) 
of the healthy subjects completed dosing with study drug for 10 days. In patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment, exposure at steady state (AUCT) to lumacaftor and ivacaftor was increased by approximately 
50% and Cmax by 30%. Advice is given in section 4.2 of the SmPC to decrease the dose to a maximum 
daily dose of lumacaftor 600 mg/ivacaftor 375 mg in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Advice 
is also given to decrease the dose further in patients with more severe hepatic impairment and to use only 
if the benefits outweigh the risks.

In study 010 two healthy volunteers had raised liver enzymes after 10 days dosing with 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor. The liver enzyme levels returned to normal after discontinuing study medication 
without further treatment, which suggests a causal relationship between the raised liver enzymes and 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Warnings are included in section 4.4 of the SmPC regarding the possibility of 
elevated liver transaminases and advising that LFTs should be checked before initiating 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy and at regular intervals during therapy. Hepatobiliary events are also 
included in the RMP as a safety concern. 
Renal impairment: In an absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) study (Study 004), 
there was minimal elimination of lumacaftor and its metabolites in urine (only 8.6% of total radioactivity 
was recovered in the urine, with 0.18% as unchanged parent). These results suggest that renal clearance 
is likely to play a minimal role in the elimination of lumacaftor and pharmacokinetic studies in subjects 
with renal impairment have not been performed. 
Pregnancy and lactation: The effects of lumacaftor on conception, pregnancy, and lactation in humans are 
not known as no adequate and well-controlled studies of ivacaftor in pregnant or lactating women have 
been conducted. Results from embryo-fetal development (EFD) reproductive toxicology studies in 
pregnant rats and rabbits indicated that lumacaftor is not a teratogen. There were 5 pregnancies in the 
Phase 3 studies and all 5 subjects were on active treatment. Given the limited data on the outcomes after 
drug exposure during pregnancy, lumacaftor should not be used during pregnancy unless the potential 
benefit justifies the potential risk. Lumacaftor and ivacaftor are excreted into the milk of lactating female 
rats. The SmPC summarizes all relevant nonclinical data on fertility, pregnancy and lactation and warns to 
only use in pregnancy or lactation when clearly needed. 
Immunological events:  There was one case of reported drug hypersensitivity that led to study drug 
discontinuation in the Phase III placebo-controlled studies. This was a patient in the lumacaftor 400mg 
q12h/ivacaftor 250mg q12h group.No other immunological events are listed in the summary of clinical 
safety. Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients is a contraindication in section 
4.3 of the SmPC. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
CYP3A inhibitors and inducers: The concomitant use of lumicaftor/ivacaftor with strong inducers of CYP3A 
is not recommended as ivacaftor systemic exposure will be decreased with possible loss of efficacy.  
Strong inhibitors of CYP3A, such as itraconazole, increase ivacaftor exposure but due to the induction of 
CYP3A by lumacaftor, the net ivacaftor exposure does not exceed that when given in the absence of 
lumacaftor at a dose of 150 mg q12h. 
Bronchodilators: Study 009 was an open-label study designed to examine the effect of ciprofloxacin, 
itraconazole, and rifampin on the PK of lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in healthy adult subjects. 
An asymptomatic, generally mild decline in FEV1 was noted in subjects within 4 hours of treatment with 
lumacaftor 200mg q12h in combination with ivacaftor 250 mg q12h. None of the subjects had an SAE, 
required treatment with concomitant medications, or had long-term sequelae as a result of the decline in 
FEV1. Given the acute nature of this finding, it was considered likely that there was an element of 
bronchoconstriction contributing to the decline in FEV1. AEs of dyspnoea and bronchospasm appear to 
occur at initiation of lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy and generally resolve without discontinuing therapy. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity, tended to occur early in treatment and 
mainly resolved without discontinuing treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor. 
Long-term safety data

Study 105 is an ongoing Phase III rollover for Studies 103, 104, and 102 Cohort 4 designed to evaluate 
the long-term safety and efficacy of LUM/IVA in subjects aged 12 years and older with CF, homozygous 
(Part A) or heterozygous (Part B) for the F508del-CFTR mutation. A total of 1108 subjects received at 
least 1 dose of study drug (placebo or LUM/IVA) in the parent Studies 103 or 104. Of these subjects, 1031 
subjects  were  enrolled  in  the  Part  A  Treatment  Cohort  and  19  subjects  were  enrolled  in  Part  A 
Observational Cohort. Of these subjects, 334 subjects who received LUM 600 mg qd/ IVA 250 mg q12h 
and 341 subjects who received LUM 400 mg q12h/IVA 250 mg q12h in the previous study continued to 
receive the same treatments in Study 105. Among the subjects who received placebo in the previous 
study, 179 subjects were randomized to receive LUM 600 mg qd/IVA 250 mg q12h and 176 subjects were 
randomized to receive LUM 400 mg q12h/IVA 250 mg q12h. 
There was a lack of overall evidence of clinical benefit in the subjects in Part B of Study 105 so all subjects 
in Part B were notified and Vertex strongly recommended that all subjects from Part B were discontinued 
from  the  study.  Two  dose  levels  of  lumacaftor  (400  mg  q12h  or  600  mg  qd)  are  being  evaluated  in 
combination with ivacaftor 250 mg q12h over a 96-week treatment period. At the time of the original MAA 
submission, enrolment in Study 105 was complete and the study was ongoing. The Applicant has provided 
an addendum to the Summary of Clinical Safety with a Second Interim Analysis of safety from Study 105 
(IA2).A total of 1092 subjects in the 103/104 Safety Set received at least 1 dose of LUM/IVA in Study 105. 
Of the subjects who received LUM/IVA in the previous study, the mean cumulative treatment duration 
was similar between the LUM 600 mg daily (qd)/IVA 250 mg every 12 hours (q12h) group (LUM 600 
group; 418.5 days) and LUM 400 mg q12h/IVA 250 mg q12h group (LUM 400 group; 420.7 days). Of the 
subjects who received placebo in the previous study, the mean treatment duration was similar between 
the placebo/LUM 600 group (279.6 days) and placebo/LUM 400 group (281.5 days). 
Most subjects received at least 24 weeks of LUM/IVA (1015 subjects [92.9%] overall) with the majority 
receiving at least 48 weeks of LUM/IVA (683 subjects [62.5%] overall). Of the subjects who received 
LUM/IVA in the previous study, the percentage of subjects who were exposed to LUM/IVA for ≥48 weeks 
was  similar  between  the  LUM  600  (84.6%)  and  the  LUM  400  (86.1%)  groups.  Of  the  subjects  who 
received placebo in the previous study, the percentage of subjects who were exposed to LUM/IVA for ≥48 
weeks was similar between placebo/LUM 600 (14.0%) and the placebo/LUM 400 (15.9%) groups

Summary of safety findings 
Overall, the incidence of subjects with adverse events was lower during the 24-48 week interval (81.3%) 
compared to the 0-24 week interval (95.8%). In general, the incidence of subjects with adverse events 
was similar between the L600qd+I group and the L400q12h+I group for all treatment intervals analyzed. 
During  the  0-24  week  interval,  the  most  common  adverse  events  (≥20%  overall)  were  infective 
pulmonary exacerbation of CF (36.7%) and cough (29.5%). The incidences of these adverse events were 
lower during the 24-48 week interval (30.3% and 20.5%, respectively) and during the >48 week interval 
(19.9% and 14.0%, respectively). Treatment with LUM/IVA was well tolerated with continued treatment. 
The incidence of subjects with adverse events that led to treatment discontinuation was low (0-24 weeks: 
4.7%; 24-48 weeks: 2.3%; >48 weeks: 0.4%).  
•  4.4% of subjects in the L600qd+I group and 5.0% subjects in the L400q12h+I group had an 
adverse event that led to treatment discontinuation during the 0-24 week interval.  
•  3.3% of subjects in the L600qd+I group and 1.4% subjects in the L400q12h+I group had an 
adverse event that led to treatment discontinuation during the 24-48 week interval.  
•  0.6% of subjects in the L600qd+I group and 0.3% subjects in the L400q12h+I group had an 
adverse event that led to treatment discontinuation during the >48 week interval.  
The most common adverse events that led to treatment discontinuation (those occurring in ≥5 subjects 
overall during any treatment interval) were respiration abnormal, dyspnea, blood creatine phosphokinase 
increased, and infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF. During the 24-48 week interval, the majority of 
subjects had adverse events that were considered mild or moderate (mild: 32.4%; moderate: 40.4%), 
which was consistent with the 0-24 week interval (mild: 35.8%; moderate: 46.9%). The incidence of 
subjects with severe adverse events was similar across all treatment intervals analyzed (0-24 weeks: 
12.9%;  24-48  weeks:  8.1%;  and  >48  weeks:  8.2%).  Life-threatening  adverse  events  occurred  in  2 
subjects during the 0-24 week interval, 3 subjects during the 24-48 week interval, and 2 subjects during 
the >48 week interval. (Note that there were 4 unique subjects who had life-threatening adverse events 
during  the  0-48  week  interval.)  In  general,  the  severity  of  adverse  events  was  similar  between  the 
L600qd+I group and the L400q12h+I group for all treatment intervals analyzed. There were 2 deaths 
during the Active Treatment Period of Part A, one in the 0-24 week period and one in the 24-48 week 
period. One death was due to infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF leading to respiratory failure in the 
L400q12h+I group that occurred approximately 1 year after the first dose of LUM/IVA. The event was 
considered not related to the study drug by the investigator. The second death was due to a pulmonary 
exacerbation  that  occurred  approximately  9  months  after  the  first  dose  of  LUM/IVA.  The  event  was 
considered not related to study drug by the investigator. The incidences of subjects with at least 1 SAE 
during the 24-48 week (175 [17.1%] subjects) and >48 week (101 [14.7%] subjects) intervals were 
similar or lower compared to the 0-24 week interval (225 [20.6%] subjects).  
The  most  common  SAE  was  infective  pulmonary  exacerbation  of  CF,  which  occurred  in  148  (13.6%) 
subjects during the 0-24 week interval, in 125 (12.2%) subjects during the 24-48 week interval, and in 
75 (10.9%) subjects during the >48 week interval. The incidences of subjects with an AESI of elevated 
transaminases during the 24-48 week (24 [2.3%] subjects) and >48 week (6 [0.9%] subjects) intervals 
were similar or lower compared to the 0-24 week interval (60 [5.5%] subjects). The incidence of subjects

with an AESI of elevated transaminases was similar between the L600qd+I group and the L400q12h+I 
group  for  all  treatment  intervals  analyzed.  The  incidences  of  subjects  with  an  AESI  of  respiratory 
symptoms during the 24-48 week (92 [9.0%] subjects) and >48 week (33 [4.8%] subjects) intervals 
were lower compared to the 0-24 week interval (252 [23.1%] subjects). The incidence of subjects with an 
AESI of respiratory symptoms was similar between the L600qd+I group and the L400q12h+I group for all 
treatment  intervals  analyzed.  The  incidences  of  subjects  with  an  AESI  of  reactive  airways  during  the 
24-48  week  (33  [3.2%]  subjects)  and  the  >48  week  (19  [2.8%]  subjects)  intervals  were  similar 
compared to  the  0-24  week  interval  (69  [6.3%]  subjects).  The  incidence  of  subjects  with  an  AESI  of 
reactive airways was similar between the L600qd+I group and the L400q12h+I group for all treatment 
intervals analyzed. The incidences of subjects with an AESI of menstrual abnormality during the 24-48 
week (17 [1.7%] subjects) and >48 week (3 [0.4%] subjects) intervals were similar compared to the 
0-24 week interval (51 [4.7%] subjects). The incidence of subjects with an AESI of menstrual abnormality 
was similar between the L600qd+I group and the L400q12h+I group for all treatment intervals analyzed.  
Overall, the incidence of subjects with PCS LFT elevations was low and similar between the 2 treatment 
groups (L600qd+I and L400q12h+I) and the 2 treatment intervals (0-24 weeks of LUM/IVA and 24-48 
weeks of LUM/IVA). There were no clinically important trends attributable to lumacaftor in combination 
with ivacaftor identified from serum chemistry, haematology, coagulation, or urinalysis results.  
There  were  no  clinically  important  trends  attributable  to  lumacaftor  in  combination  with  ivacaftor 
identified from vital signs, standard ECGs, pulse oximetry, or spirometry results. In general the incidence 
of AEs in the long term safety set was lower in the extension study (105) than in the placebo-controlled 
studies  (103  and  104)  and  lower  or  similar  in  the  24-48  week  period  compared  with  the  0-24-week 
period. The Applicant has submitted additional long-term data from Study 105 including data on a larger 
number of subjects for at least 48 weeks exposure to lumacaftor/ivacaftor. These data do not give rise to 
any concerns about new or more severe adverse events occurring with long term exposure (up to 80 
weeks) to lumacaftor/ivacaftor. In fact the rate of adverse events tends to decrease with longer duration 
of treatment.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
A total of 1615 subjects were exposed to lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in Phase 1 through 
Phase 3 studies. Overall 738 subjects with CF were exposed to at least 1 dose of the LUM/IVA combination 
in the pooled placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies: 369 subjects received LUM 400 mg q12h/IVA 250 mg 
q12h and 369 subjects received LUM 600 mg qd/ IVA 250 mg q12h group. The median treatment duration 
in the phase 3 studies was 168 days (range: 1 to 182) for subjects in the total LUM/IVA group and 168 
days (range: 7 to 181) for subjects in the placebo group. Long-term safety data are available from Study 
105 for 674 subjects who continued on active treatment after receiving LUM/IVA for 24 weeks in Studies 
103/104.  The  study  is  ongoing  and  is  intended  to  evaluate  the  safety  of  LUM/IVA  combination  up  to 
approximately 96 weeks. The results of the study will be submitted to the CHMP as it is captured in the 
RMP  for  Orkambi.  Overall  the  safety  database  is  considered  adequate  to  evaluate  the  safety  of  the 
LUM/IVA combination therapy in different dose regimens in the short-term. 
In  general,  the  AEs  seen  in  the  clinical  programme  for  lumacaftor/ivacaftor  were  as  expected  in  the 
patient population with CF, and were mild to moderate in severity, occurred early in treatment and mainly 
resolved without discontinuing treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor. The pattern of AEs remained similar 
in  the  extension  study  with  no  evidence  of  increase  in  incidence  or  severity.  Serious  adverse  events 
(SAEs)  were  reported  in  28.6%  of  patients  taking  placebo  and  20.1%  of  patients  taking

lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Few of these were thought to be related to study medication, of which the most 
commonly  reported  were 
increased  creatinine  phosphokinase, 
liver 
function  test  abnormal, 
bronchospasm  and  rash.  The  main  AEs  that  are  thought  to  be  related  to  treatment  with 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor are respiratory (cough, dyspnoea, bronchospasm) and gastrointestinal (diarrhoea, 
nausea and vomiting). The most common AEs were signs/symptoms related to uncontrolled CF. Although 
infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF and cough were more represented in the placebo group, no clear 
evidence of significant benefit in disease control by LUM/IVA treatment was evident. Similarly, sputum 
production  was  only  slightly  increased  in  placebo  compared  to  LUM/IVA-treated  group.  In  the  total 
LUM/IVA group, a major incidence of upper respiratory tract infections was also observed compared to 
placebo. This information was reflected in the SmPC in order to fully inform the prescribing physicians. 
The majority of AEs occurred within the first 8 weeks of treatment both in the placebo as well as in the 
LUM/IVA-treated groups. However, it is noted that, the incidence of some respiratory AEs, i.e. cough, 
dyspnoea,  and  infective  pulmonary  exacerbation,  decreased  with  time  in  the  placebo  group  reaching 
approximately the frequency observed in the LUM/IVA-treated arms. This observation seems suggestive 
of adjustments in the background therapy in the placebo group which could impact on the interpretation 
of both safety as well as efficacy results.  
Increase creatinine phosphokinase was reported in healthy volunteers taking lumacaftor/ivacaftor as well 
as in patients with CF and was associated with one case of rhabdomyolysis. In general, reports of raised 
liver enzymes are confounded by the fact that patients with CF are predisposed to liver abnormalities. 
However, a causal relationship cannot be ruled out and warnings are included in the SmPC with advice to 
monitor LFTs before instigating therapy with lumacaftor/ivacaftor and at regular intervals during therapy. 
This was considered sufficient by the CHMP. 
Ophthalmological effects, particularly cataracts in children under the age of 12 years has been noted in 
association with ivacaftor exposure in juvenile rats and an observational study in children under the age 
of 12 years is ongoing. In the Phase III placebo-controlled studies for lumacaftor/ivacaftor, a baseline 
ophthalmological  examination  was  performed  to  rule  out  pre-existing  abnormalities,  hence  a  warning 
statement on this potential risk was included in 4.4 of the SmPC. The applicant agreed to follow up the 
patients with an ophthalmological examination based on CHMP’s request.  
Menstrual abnormalities were reported in particular in patients taking the oral contraceptive pill (OCP) 
and are most likely due to induction of CYP3A enzymes by lumacaftor affecting the metabolism of the 
OCP.  Therefore  it  is  advised  that  non-hormonal  contraception  should  be  used  when  taking 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor and the SmPC includes this advice. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the safety of the combination of LUM/IVA in the treatment of patients with CF who are 
homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene is considered to be sufficiently characterised.  The 
combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor in the treatment of these patients has been shown to be generally 
well tolerated, with few serious adverse events related to study medication. Most AEs are mild in nature 
and resolve without treatment. The AEs that may potentially cause concern, such as raised liver enzymes 
or ophthalmological effects are balanced by appropriate risk minimisation measures.  
During the course of the evaluation, the applicant submitted more data on long-term safety from Study 
105, with 683 patients receiving lumacaftor/ivacaftor for at least 48 weeks. The data from the long-term 
safety study 105 has not demonstrated any increased safety concerns with longer duration of therapy.

Further, Orkambi has not been studied in patients with 
CF who have a gating (Class III) mutation in the CFTR 
gene on one allele, with or without the F508del

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Lum 400mg bd/iva 250mg bd caused a significant improvement in the surrogate endpoint of ppFEV1 as 
early as 15 days of treatment which was maintained till 48 weeks. The extent of improvement in ppFEV1 
was 1.68% and 2.63% at 24 weeks in study 103 and 104 respectively. This improvement was maintained 
at 48 weeks. An improvement in ppFEV1 of around 3.5% was seen at the second interim analysis of study 
105 in patients who were on placebo in the pivotal studies but crossed-over to Lum 400mg bd/iva 250mg 
bd in study 105. The other key secondary endpoints on spirometry also showed similar improvements. 
The observed effects on the primary endpoint is small, but nevertheless can be accepted as clinically 
relevant as FEV1 is a significant predictor of mortality in cystic fibrosis and the benefits of higher FEV1 in 
CF patients have been described in the literature. Lum 400mg bd/iva 250 mg bd also caused a significant 
improvement in the gastrointestinal/nutritional endpoint of change in BMI from baseline in both pivotal 
studies and this benefit was seen to be sustained in study 105. Lum 400mg bd/iva 250 mg bd showed 
reductions in the clinical endpoint of number of pulmonary exacerbations including those that required 
hospitalization and those requiring IV antibiotic therapy. Consistent observations were seen with a 
reduction in the number of days with pulmonary exacerbations, of hospitalisation and on antibiotic 
therapy as compared to placebo.  Increase in number of pulmonary exacerbations and decline in 
nutritional status have been correlated with mortality in CF and so a clinically relevant beneficial effect of 
lum/iva is anticipated based on the observed effects. In any case lum/iva reduced the need for IV 
antibiotics and hospitalization which directly reduces the overall treatment burden of these patients. The 
effects on secondary endpoints that were seen in the pivotal studies were maintained in the long-term 
extension study for up to 48 weeks treatment. In addition, patients who were on placebo in studies 103 
and 104 and who were rolled over to active treatment in study 105 showed similar benefits to that 
observed in pivotal studies on both primary and secondary endpoints for the treatment duration of 24 
weeks in study 105. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Adequate supporting evidence from PD endpoints, which could provide evidence for sustained activity at 
the target mechanism of action is not available as there were limited PD assessments in the overall 
development of lum/iva. A relevant and significant effect on lum/iva on sweat chloride over and above 
lum monotherapy was not demonstrated and the effects of lum/iva on nasal potential difference have not 
been evaluated as the endpoint was considered not sensitive to the treatment. In study 102, the effects 
of lum/iva are not from baseline, as patients were already on lum monotherapy. So the additional 
contribution of ivacaftor on PD effects is not clear. Furthermore, the pivotal studies did not evaluate 
effects on sweat chloride and so evidence on long-term maintenance of target effects is also not available. 
In the phase 2 clinical studies 101 and 102, reports of transient but significant drops in FEV1 due to an 
off-target effect of lumacaftor were observed and this was persistent for the observed treatment duration 
of 28 days. This effect did not result in significant withdrawals and could be managed by bronchodilators 
as this off-target effect was reported to be reversible. However, the applicant did not further evaluate the 
lumacaftor  monotherapy  based  on  the  observed  transient  bronchoconstriction.  The  additional 
contribution of ivacaftor on FEV1 is therefore available only in short-term studies and not from long-term 
studies.

A  treatment  effect  on  the  reduction  in  the  slope  of  decline  in  FEV1  has  not  been  conclusively 
demonstrated. An accrual of positive treatment effect with lum/iva cannot be inferred with confidence 
given the small effect size. A constant 2.55% difference in FEV1 through life may not justify using the 
combination as a life-long treatment, but an accrued benefit in FEV1 expanding with time from a 2% 
baseline can be significant and support a life-long therapy. The applicant has presented analyses from the 
additional data available from second interim analysis of study 105 which shows a trend towards reducing 
the slope of decline. Given the smaller than anticipated 'effect size' and the lack of conclusive evidence in 
altering 
the  disease  pathology  beneficially,  additional 
long-term  data  would  be  required 
post-authorisation.  The  effects  on  CFQ-R  and  BMI  though  supportive  do  not  in  themselves  allow  for 
conclusion of clinical relevance. The clinical relevance of the BMI changes in terms of lung function and 
overall patient benefit remains to be fully explored. The effects of lum/iva on pancreatic function have not 
been evaluated in detail.  
Only interim data from study 105 is available for a total treatment duration of up to 48 weeks, although 
the study is planned to provide data from total treatment duration of up to 120 weeks. Data from this 
ongoing study is important in the context of the small effect size seen on the primary endpoint, the lack 
of  adequate  evaluation  of  lumacaftor  monotherapy  and  the  lack  of  adequate  evidence  for  a  clinically 
relevant contribution of ivacaftor over the long term. Upon CHMP’s request, the applicant committed to 
provide this long-term data during the post-authorisation phase as agreed in the RMP. 
Although  the  effects  were  demonstrated  in  a  typical  clinical  study  population,  the  representation  of 
patients with rapidly progressive disease and patient with higher number of exacerbations could have 
been  higher.  Nevertheless,  in  the  context  of  this  rare  disease  this  is  considered  acceptable  for 
authorisation. Although two dose regimens were evaluated in the pivotal phase III studies, there was no 
statistical comparison between these two dose regimens which were close to each other. The difference 
in efficacy and safety between the two dose regimens is not conclusive. In this background, it is uncertain 
if the proposed LUM/IVA 400/250mg BD is preferable to LUM 600mg OD/IVA 250 mg BD.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The main unfavourable adverse events related to treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor were respiratory 
(cough, dyspnoea and bronchospasm) and gastrointestinal (diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting). SAEs were 
reported in 28.6% of patients taking placebo and 20.1% of patients taking lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Few of 
these were thought to be related to study medication (placebo 2.2%, LUM/IVA 600qd/250q12h 2.2%, 
LUM/IVA  400q12h/250q12h  3.8%)  of  which  the  most  commonly  reported  were  increased  creatinine 
phosphokinase,  liver  function  test  abnormal,  bronchospasm  and  rash.  Reports  of  increased  liver 
transaminases are confounded by the fact that patients with CF are predisposed to liver abnormalities. 
However a causal relationship cannot be ruled out and warnings are included in the SmPC with advice to 
monitor LFTs before instigating therapy with lumacaftor/ivacaftor and at regular intervals during therapy. 
Menstrual abnormalities occurred as well, particularly in patients taking the oral contraceptive pill (OCP), 
and are most likely due to induction of CYP3A enzymes by lumacaftor affecting the metabolism of the 
OCP.  Therefore  it  is  advised  that  non-hormonal  contraception  should  be  used  when  taking 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor, as per the SmPC. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Raised  hepatic  enzymes  have  been  reported 
in  healthy  volunteers  and  patients 
taking 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor and it are currently unknown whether this translates into hepatotoxicity with longer 
term therapy. Monitoring of liver function tests is recommended upon initiation and during treatment with 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor. 
Assessment report  
EMA/686121/2018 
Page 99/104 
 
 
In  addition,  raised  creatinine  phosphokinase  has  been  reported  with  a  diagnosis  of  asymptomatic 
rhabdomyolysis in one healthy volunteer. The mechanism by which lumacaftor/ivacaftor leads to raised 
creatinine phosphokinase is not understood; neither is it known whether this could result in further cases 
of rhabdomyolysis with wider exposure to the drug. Following review of all cases of raised CPK in the 
clinical programme, out of eleven cases of raised CPK on active treatment who discontinued, seven had 
positive  de-challenge  returning  back  to  baseline,  and  four  had  negative  de-challenge  with  persistent 
elevated levels.  Overall, apart from the imbalance in discontinuations, the absolute incidence of CPK was 
similar in active and placebo treatment arms. The applicant could not identify any biological mechanisms 
that  could  possibly  result  in  raised  CPK.  Therefore,  currently  there seems  to be  not  solid  evidence to 
implicate lum/iva in raised CPK.  
Ophthalmological effects have been reported in association with ivacaftor exposure in juvenile rats and an 
observational study in children under the age of 12 years is ongoing. In the Phase III placebo-controlled 
studies  for  lumacaftor/ivacaftor,  subjects  over  the  age  of  12  years  were  enrolled  and  a  baseline 
ophthalmological  examination  was  performed  to  rule  out  pre-existing  abnormalities  but  there  are  no 
plans  for  follow  up  examinations  following  long-term  exposure  in  Study  105.  The  applicant  was 
recommended  to  arrange  for  ophthalmological  examinations  of  subjects  leaving  Study  105  wherever 
feasible. It is unknown whether the ophthalmological effects seen in juvenile rats have any relevance to 
treatment in humans. The concern is particularly in children under 12 years of age and it is proposed that 
treatment with lum/iva is limited to treatment of children and adults over the age of 12 years, which is 
hence reflected in the indication of Orkambi. 
Further  data  on  long  term  exposure  to  lumacaftor/ivacaftor  were  submitted  from  study  105.  
Approximately 683 patients received lumacaftor/ivacaftor for at least 48 weeks. There is no firm evidence 
that longer-term exposure to lumacaftor/ivacaftor leads to increased risks and the long term safety study 
is still ongoing. The applicant has committed to submit a final report on Study 105 and to endeavour to 
follow up the patients up to 5 years, as described in the section on Risk Management Plan. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Although the effect-size on the surrogate primary endpoint of change in ppFEV1 is small, a consistent 
effect  has  been  demonstrated  across  the  two  studies  and  for  the  two  dose-regimens  of  the  lum/iva 
combination.  Further  the  results  on  the  other  spirometry  endpoints  are  similarly  consistent  and 
supportive of the observations on the primary endpoint. These observations are also supported by the 
results  on  other  secondary  endpoints  of  BMI  and  CFQ-R  and  although  all  observations  were  not 
significant, they were at least numerically in favour of the treatment arms. 
In addition, relevant effects on clinical endpoints of a number of pulmonary exacerbations including those 
that require IV antibiotics and those requiring hospitalisation have been demonstrated. The effects on 
these endpoints appear consistent across both studies and for both the dose-regimens. A positive effect 
is seen on the gastrointestinal/nutritional endpoint as well suggesting correction of CFTR defects in an 
organ system other than lung. Moreover, these endpoints (FEV1, exacerbations, nutritional status) are 
co-related with mortality in CF.  
However,  in  the  CHMP’s  opinion,  some  uncertainties  about  the  favourable  effects  of  Orkambi  remain. 
Solid supporting evidence from PD results which could provide evidence for additive and long-term effects 
on  target-CFTR  protein  activity  is  not  available.  The  small  effect  size  on  lung  function  would  not  be 
adequate  to  support  a  chronic  life-long  treatment of  patients,  especially  when  the  responder  analysis 
showed that more than 50% of the treated patients did not achieve a >5% improvement in ppFEV1. The 
effects on CFQ-R and BMI, though supportive, do not in themselves support a conclusion of major clinical 
relevance.  However  given  the  consistency  in  results  across  the  endpoints  in  different  subgroups  and 
Assessment report  
EMA/686121/2018 
Page 100/104 
 
 
across the three studies, it can be accepted that there is a clinically relevant and significant treatment 
effect which is maintained for the duration of 48 weeks treatment in line with the currently available data. 
The concern on whether the treatment will continue to be beneficial beyond that duration, especially as a 
conclusive  effect  in  the  alteration  of  disease  pathology  has  not  yet  been  demonstrated,  can  only  be 
answered when further longer term data are available. It is acceptable for this data to be submitted in the 
post-authorisation phase. 
Furthermore, the study population seems to be poorly represented with patients with higher degree of 
exacerbations and with patients who have rapidly progressive disease. The typical study population in a 
controlled study is limited in its ability to represent the true clinical population by the selection criteria. 
The real results of the treatment in the overall patient population will be seen in the post-authorisation 
setting; hence the applicant is requested to report the results of study 105 in a timely manner as reflected 
in the RMP. 
Although the use of a free-combination offers more flexibility and permits dose-titration in general, based 
on the low number of treatment discontinuations in case of lum/iva, the real need for dose-titration is not 
apparent. Therefore, the fixed-dose combination which offers more convenience especially when it comes 
to compliance, can be accepted.  
The LUM/IVA 400/250mg BD has not been associated with a significantly higher safety concerns than 
ivacaftor and has been consistently associated with at least a numerically higher effect on pulmonary 
exacerbations across the studies. Therefore the proposed LUM/IVA 400/250mg BD dose is acceptable to 
the CHMP.  
Most  of  the  unfavourable  effects  are  related  to  the  GI  system  or  respiratory  system  and  these  have 
generally been mild to moderate. Serious adverse events have not been generally reported with a higher 
incidence  than  placebo.  The  only  serious  adverse  reactions  occurring  in  at  least  0.5%  of  patients  on 
Orkambi  and  greater  than  placebo  were  hepatobiliary  events,  including  4  reported  as  transaminase 
elevations, 2 as cholestatic hepatitis, and 1 as hepatic encephalopathy. There are safety concerns related 
to raised creatinine phosphokinase, raised liver enzymes and cataract formation, but the extent of clinical 
concern due to these signals has not yet been fully characterised. These events are being monitored and 
adequate information has been included in the SmPC and RMP of Orkambi to ensure their control.   
Benefit-risk balance 
A consistent and significant effect of lum/iva on the surrogate endpoint of change in ppFEV1 has been 
demonstrated. FEV1 is a known predictor of mortality in CF and is an accepted primary endpoint. The 
effects  on  secondary  endpoints  support  the  conclusions  drawn  based  on  the  primary  endpoint. 
Furthermore, a robust effect on clinical endpoints of pulmonary exacerbations, including exacerbations 
requiring  IV  antibiotics  and  exacerbations  requiring  hospitalisations,  has  been  demonstrated.  These 
results are supported by the observations in the longer term (48 weeks) data. The results in different 
sub-groups,  based  on  baseline  lung  function,  concomitant  medication,  age,  rate  of  progression,  early 
effects on lung function, appear to be in favour of the treatment. However, given the small effect size, 
longer term data (beyond 48 weeks) are considered necessary to be provided. The CHMP accepted this to 
be collected in the post-authorisation setting. Overall, the effect size on the primary endpoint is smaller 
than anticipated and similar to the effect of other symptomatic treatments, which is sub-standard for a 
treatment that targets disease pathology especially in light of the expectations set by ivacaftor therapy in 
CFTR G551D. However it is acknowledged that CFTR F508del is a more severe condition and moreover the 
effect size is an added benefit on top of standard of care where this target group have no other alternative 
treatment  options.  In  this  context,  the  observed  effects  on  the  primary  endpoint  can  be  considered 
clinically  relevant.  The  overall  treatment  effects  remain  clinically  meaningful  till  48  weeks  and  the 
available evidence on efficacy is considered adequate to support the proposed use of LUM/IVA.

The adverse events of the combination have generally been associated with GI and respiratory system 
and have been mild to moderate. The combination does not increase the incidence of severe adverse 
events  except  a  small  rise  in  hepatobiliary  events  as  compared  to  placebo.  It  is  agreed  that  the 
combination of lum/iva has an acceptable safety profile at the proposed dose in the target population.  
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Similar benefit of lum/iva combination has been demonstrated with both the dose-regimens tested in 
both  studies.  The  effect-size  and  the  direction  of  the  effects  on  all  the  evaluated  endpoints  are 
comparable between the two studies. So it can be accepted that the treatment benefits seen in the two 
studies  (study  103  and  study  104)  are  a  realistic  estimation  of  the  treatment  effects  of  lum/iva.  The 
extent of benefit is smaller than anticipated as seen by the effect-size on the primary endpoint of change 
in FEV1. The seen effect is smaller than the anticipated benefit and smaller than the effect seen with 
ivacaftor in CF patients with G551D defect. However, it should be considered that this effect is over and 
above the current concomitant treatment. In this context an added treatment effect albeit one that is 
comparable to other symptomatic treatments is clinically relevant. Furthermore, the effect on pulmonary 
exacerbations  and  other  endpoints  is  more  robust  and  in  itself  the  effect  size  demonstrated  in  the 
reduction in number of pulmonary of exacerbations including those requiring IV antibiotic therapy and 
those requiring hospitalization is considered clinically relevant. The effects on CFQ-R and  BMI are not 
conclusive of a clinically relevant treatment effect in themselves. The observed clinical relevance of a 
constant  2.5%  improvement  on  lung  function  up  to  48  weeks  of  treatment  is  expected  to  be  further 
supported  by  the  evidence  on  maintenance  of  treatment  effects  beyond  48  weeks  in  the 
post-authorisation setting.  
The long-term data of treatment up to 48 weeks showed the maintenance of effect on exacerbations in 
the patients who had received active treatment in the pivotal studies. In patients who received placebo in 
the pivotal studies, and were crossed over to active treatment, beneficial effect on all endpoints including 
exacerbations was noted which was of a comparable magnitude to the effect seen in the active treatment 
arms during the pivotal studies. There are certain sub-groups like patients with rapid progression and 
patients  with  high  number  of  exacerbations/year  that  appear  to  be  under-represented  in  the  study 
population. Results from such patients are expected from the post-marketing setting data.  
The proposed dose has been evaluated in a reasonable number of patients for up to 48 weeks treatment. 
The combination has been generally well tolerated with very few discontinuations through-out the 48 
week  study  period.  The  main  adverse  events  related  to  treatment  with  lumacaftor/ivacaftor  were 
respiratory (cough, dyspnoea and bronchospasm) and gastrointestinal (diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting) 
which  were  generally  mild  to  moderate.  The  incidence  of  serious  adverse  events  was  lower  in  active 
treatment as compared to placebo. The common related serious adverse reactions included increased 
creatinine phosphokinase, liver function test abnormal, bronchospasm and rash. Overall the safety profile 
of  the  combination  has  been  reasonably  well  characterised.  The  observed  risks  are  generally  mild  to 
moderate. The potential significant risks can be monitored in the clinics and can be adequately addressed 
in the RMP.  
Given that adequate evidence of a clinical relevant efficacy maintained over 48 weeks treatment has been 
demonstrated and the characterised safety profile shows the combination has acceptable tolerability, the 
benefit-risk  analysis  is  considered  positive.  The  long-term  safety  and  efficacy  of  Orkambi  will  be 
monitored in a post-marketing setting.

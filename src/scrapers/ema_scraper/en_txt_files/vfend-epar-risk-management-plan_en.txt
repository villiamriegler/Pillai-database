VFEND (VORICONAZOLE) RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN
RMP Version number: 6.3
Data lock point for this RMP: 31 May 2023
Date of final sign off: 29 June 2023
Rationale for submitting an updated RMP: 

In May 2022, the MAH submitted a Type II variation including an updated EU RMP v
6.0, following the completion of the PASS A1501103 included in the pharmacovigilance
plan. In addition, in line with PRAC PSUR assessment report (Procedure no.:
EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00003127/202102) dated October 2021, the RMP was updated to re-
move the important identified risk of “Peripheral neuropathy” and the missing infor-
mation of “Resistance” from the list of the safety concerns.
 The MAH received a first RSI dated 01 September 2022 as part of procedure
EMEA/H/C/WS2270 whereby the EMA requested the MAH continue to make the Pa-
tient Alert Card available for the important identified risks of Phototoxicity and Squa-
mous cell carcinoma. An updated RMP v6.1 was submitted in November 2022 as part of
this response.

In March 2023, the MAH submitted an updated RMP version (6.2) to respond to a 2nd
RSI dated 12 January 2023 as part of procedure EMEA/H/C/WS2270 whereby the EMA
have indicated to:



remove the following important risks and missing information from the Summary of
safety concerns: ‘Hepatic toxicity’, ‘QTc prolongation’, ‘Visual events’, ‘Skin can-
cer (non-SCC)’, ‘Suicide-related events’, ‘Effects in pregnancy’, ‘Effects in paediat-
rics’ and ‘Off-label use’.
remove the statement in Part III.2. Additional Pharmacovigilance Activities.
add key elements of the Patient Alert Card in Annex 6.
 The MAH is submitting an updated RMP version (6.3) to respond to a 3rd RSI dated 12
May 2023 as part of procedure EMEA/H/C/WS2270 whereby the EMA have indicated
to update, with additional text, the key elements of the Patient Alert Card in Annex 6.

Note: Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 112 immunocompromised paedi-
atric patients aged 2 to <12 years and 26 immunocompromised adolescents aged 12 to <17 
years
All other adolescents (12 to 14 years and ≥50 kg; 15 to 17 years regardless of body
weight): voriconazole should be dosed as adults.
Dosage adjustment (Children [2 to <12 years] and young adolescents with low body 
weight [12 to 14 years and <50 kg]) If patient response to treatment is inadequate, 
the dose may be increased by 1 mg/kg steps (or by 50 mg steps if the maximum oral 
dose of 350 mg was used initially). If patient is unable to tolerate treatment, reduce 
the dose by 1 mg/kg steps (or by 50 mg steps if the maximum oral dose of 350 mg 
was used initially).
Use in paediatric patients aged 2 to <12 years with hepatic or renal insufficiency has 
not been studied.
Prophylaxis in Adults and Children
Prophylaxis should be initiated on the day of transplant and may be administered for 
up to 100 days. Prophylaxis should be as short as possible depending on the risk for 
developing invasive fungal infection (IFI) as defined by neutropenia or immunosup-
pression. It may only be continued up to 180 days after transplantation in case of 
continuing immunosuppression or graft versus host disease (GvHD) 
Dosage 
The recommended dosing regimen for prophylaxis is the same as for treatment in 
the respective age groups. Please refer to the treatment tables above.

Voriconazole is a broad-spectrum, triazole antifungal agent and is indicated in adults and 
children aged 2 years and above as follows:
 Treatment of invasive aspergillosis.
 Treatment of candidaemia in non-neutropenic patients. 
 Treatment of fluconazole-resistant serious invasive Candida infections (including C. 
krusei). 
 Treatment of serious fungal infections caused by Scedosporium spp. and Fusarium spp.
Voriconazole should be administered primarily to patients with progressive, possibly life-
threatening infections.
 Prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections in high-risk allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell 
transplant (HSCT) recipients.
Module SI. Epidemiology of the Indication(s) and Target Population (s)
SI.1. Invasive Aspergillosis (IA)
Aspergillosis is caused by an infection with an Aspergillus fungus. The incidence of IA has 
been increasing in recent decades corresponding with the increase in the number of immuno-
compromised patients.
The section below summarizes the epidemiology of IA in the EU and US general population, 
and patient subpopulations.3
SI.1.1. Incidence 
The data on the incidence of IA in the general population are scarce. The search identified 
one study that reported the incidence of IA in the US general population. 
Europe
No study was found reporting incidence of IA in the general population from the EU region.
United States
In a review article, Pfaller, et al, reported the incidence of IA (from 1996 to 2003) in the US 
general population from the National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS). The NHDS is con-
ducted annually by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). 
3 Throughout the literature review, IA was represented by the following Boolean search terms: [(aspergil-
losis OR invasive aspergillosis OR IA OR fungaemia) AND epidemiology OR population-based OR incidence 
OR prevalence OR mortality)].

NHDS data serve as a basis for calculating statistics on hospital inpatient utilization in the 
US. The incidence of IA (per 100,000 population) was reported to be 3.4 in 1996, 4.1 in 2000 
and 2.2 in 2003. 1  
In the US population, the MAH analysed the NHDS data using the same International Classi-
fication of Diseases Code 9 (ICD-9) for IA documented in the Pfaller, et al paper 1 and esti-
mated the incidence of IA from 2004 to 2007 in the US general population.

In an analysis using the National Inpatient Sample2, a hospital discharge database in the US, 
there were 169,110 IA-related hospitalizations during 2000-2013. The rate of IA-related hos-
pitalizations per 1 million persons rose from 32.7 in 2000 to 45.7 in 2013.
Incidence of IA in selected patient subpopulations: As mentioned earlier, IA infections 
primarily occur in patients with immunocompromised status. Several studies were found that 
reported rates of IA in patients with hematologic malignancy, or HSCT recipients, or solid 
organ transplant (SOT).
The following table summarizes IA incidence estimates in selected patient subpopulations.

Below is a summary of a few studies.
Patients with haematologic malignancy or HSCT: Overall the incidence of IA in patients 
with haematologic malignancies was reported to be approximately 2.6%.3  In patients with 
AML, the IA incidence ranged from 5% to 24% and in patients with ALL, it was 3.8%.4  
Among patients with HSCT, the IA incidence ranged from 0.5% in patients with autologous 
HSCT to 23% in patients with allogeneic HSCT. 4 5   
In addition, the rate of invasive fungal infection (IFI) in allogeneic HSCT recipients who un-
derwent autopsy was reported to be 30% (99/327).3
Below are the details of studies reporting incidence of IA.
In a retrospective review of medical records of patients admitted to 18 hospitals in Italy be-
tween 1999 and 2003, Pagano and colleagues examined 11,802 patients with haematologic 
malignancies: among these patients, 310 patients with IA were identified, with an incidence 
of 2.6%.6  In a study conducted at a large tertiary care hospital in France, Nicolle (2011) esti-
mated IA incidence in patients with AML (n=2,078) and ALL (850) admitted between 2004 
and 2009. The IA incidence rate was 1.9 (95% CI: 1.5, 2.3) per 1000 patient-day in patients 
with AML and 1.3 (95% CI: 0.8, 2.0) per 1000 patient-day in patients with ALL.7

In another study, Morgan, et al estimated the incidence of IA in 4,621 patients with HSCT at 
Transplant Associated Infections Surveillance Network (TransNet) sites across the US, dur-
ing a 22-month period, from 01 March 2001 through 31 December 2002. Incidence of IA at 
12 months was 0.5% after autologous HSCT, 2.3% after allogeneic HSCT from a human leu-
kocyte antigen (HLA) matched related donor, 3.2% after transplantation from a HLA-mis-
matched related donor, and 3.9% after transplantation from an unrelated donor. 5
In an updated analysis of TransNet data with a cohort of 16,200 HSCT recipients who re-
ceived their first transplants between March 2001 and September 2005 and were followed up 
through March 2006, the 6-month and 12-month IA incidence were 1.3% and 1.6%, respec-
tively.8
In a recent literature review, Herbrecht et al. (2012) summarized the rate of IA in patients 
with immunocompromised status. The rate of IA in patients with allogeneic HSCT ranged 
from 2.7% to 23%, and in patients with autologous HSCT ranged from 0.5% to 6%.4
Patients with SOT: The incidence of IA in patients with lung transplant ranged from 2.4% 
to 26%, heart 0.4% to 15%, liver 0.3% to 10% kidney 0.1% to 1%, pancreas 1.1% to 2.9%, 
and small bowel 0 to 11%.4 5 9
Below is the overview of studies summarizing the incidence of IA in patients with SOT. 
A retrospective analysis of medical records of patients receiving SOT at the Cleveland Clinic 
Foundation to estimate the incidence of IA was conducted. Overall, a total of 33 cases of IA 
with an incidence of 4.8 per 1000 patient-years (33 per 6813 patient-year) were reported in 
patients with SOT. The incidence was higher for lung transplant recipients compared to other 
SOT recipients: lung 12.8% (24 cases per 188 patients) or 40.5 per 1000-patient year; heart 
0.4% (3/686) or 1.4 per 1000 patient-year; liver 0.7% (3/439); 1 per 1000 patient year; and 
renal 0.4% (3/733) or 1.2 per 1000 patient-year. 9
Morgan, et al using TransNet data described earlier, estimated the incidence of IA at 12 
months as 2.4% after lung transplantation, 0.8% after heart transplantation, 0.3% after liver 
transplantation, and 0.1% after kidney transplantation. 5
The review article by Herbrecht et al. (2012) also reported the incidence of IA in patients 
who had received SOT: 3% to 26% in patients with lung or heart-lung, 0.4% to 15% for 
heart, 0.7% to 10% for liver, 1.1% to 2.9% for pancreas, 0.2% to 1% for kidney and 0 to 11% 
in patients with small bowel transplant. 4
Patients infected with HIV: IA has been reported to be rare in patients with HIV infection. 
It mainly occurs in HIV patients with neutropenia or those receiving corticosteroids, however 
in many patients with HIV no recognized risk factors have been identified. 
In a retrospective study all HIV-infected patients hospitalized between January 1986 and 
April 1997 in 4 Italian Departments of Infectious Diseases in an area of high prevalence of 
HIV infection (Ferrara, Bologna, Reggio Emilia, and Venezia) were examined for IA.

June 2023
Of 2,614 patients diagnosed with HIV/AIDS during the study period, 2.1% (54 total patients; 
13 females and 41 males, average age 32 years) were identified with IA. 
The mean interval between the diagnosis of HIV and the diagnosis of IA was 10.4 months 
(range 0 to 36 months).10  
In a study conducted by Holding, et al, the authors analysed data collected from medical rec-
ords of HIV-infected patients from the Adult and Adolescent Spectrum of HIV Disease pro-
ject (ASD) from January 1990 through January 1998. In this study, HIV infected patients 
aged > 13 years from inpatient and outpatient facilities in 10 US cities, were selected at their 
first health care visit. Among 35,252 HIV-infected patients, there were 228 cases of aspergil-
losis, yielding an incidence of 3.5 cases per 1,000 person-years (95% CI: 3.0 to 4.0 per 1000 
person-year). 11
Patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU): In a review of medical charts of 8988 pa-
tients admitted to an ICU in a tertiary care hospital in Belgium between July 1997 and De-
cember 1999, 71 patients were identified with positive cultures for Aspergillus spp. A total of 
37 cases were classified as either definite or probable IA, representing an incidence of 4 per 
1000 ICU admissions.12
SI.1.2. Prevalence
No study reporting the prevalence of IA was found during the literature search.
SI.1.3. Demographics of the population, age, gender, racial and/or ethnic origin and 
risk factors for the disease
Age: age has been identified as an important risk factor for IA. The incidence in paediatric 
populations is reported to be lower than those in adult populations.13
Sex: IA is reported to be more common in males. In a systematic review by Lin, et al de-
scribed earlier, information on sex was reported for 225 of the 373 patients with individual 
data. Of total 225 patients, 63 (28%) were female and 162 (72%) were male.14
Risk Factors for the Disease:
Potential health risk for Invasive Aspergillosis, Candidaemia in Non-Neutropenic Patients, 
Fluconazole-Resistant Serious Invasive Candida Infections (Including C. krusei), Serious 
Fungal Infections Caused by Scedosporium spp. and Fusarium spp.
SI.1.4. The main existing treatment options
For IA, although voriconazole is recommended as the first line treatment, liposomal ampho-
tericin B is considered as an alternative by the Infectious Diseases Society of America 
(IDSA)15 and by the European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases 
(ESCMID).16

The recommendations are graded by strength (from A- strongly supports a recommendation 
for use to C- poor evidence to support a recommendation) and ranked according to level of 
scientific evidence (I- strongest to III- weakest). Other available options are recommended as 
salvage therapy and consist of other lipid formulations of amphotericin (A-II), posaconazole 
(B-II), itraconazole (B-II), caspofungin (B-II), or micafungin (B-II). Primary therapy with 
amphotericin B deoxycholate is not recommended (A-I) unless the economic status in a 
given institution or country precludes the use of other compounds. 
Prophylactic Indications: For primary antifungal prophylaxis in allogeneic HSCT patients, 
only fluconazole and voriconazole were graded as AI drugs during the initial neutropenic 
phase in the ECIL-3 guidelines, and only posaconazole and voriconazole4 were graded as AI 
drugs during the GvHD phase.17  Other antifungals are also recommended; those included are 
fluconazole, itraconazole, the echinocandins and the polyenes.
SI.1.5. Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including 
mortality and morbidity:
Invasive aspergillosis mortality in the general population: In a review article by Pfaller 
and colleagues described above, the author also reported analysis from the multiple cause-of-
death data and provided the mortality rates of IA in the US general population for the years 
1991 through 2003. The IA mortality rates (per 100,000 population) were approximately 0.42 
in 1997 and 0.25 in 2003.1
Invasive aspergillosis mortality in patient subpopulations: Lin, et al systematically pooled 
the mortality data from clinical trials, cohort or case control studies, and case series of > 10 
patients (77 studies in total) with definite or probable IA and reported the mortality rate for 
IA by underlying conditions. The overall mortality rate in patients with IA was reported to be 
58%. The mortality was highest in patients with HSCT recipients (86.7%). 
The mortality rate for male patients is reported to be slightly higher than that for female pa-
tients (56.8% vs. 47.6%). The rate did not vary significantly by age. Below is a description of 
studies reporting IA mortality rate in patient subpopulations.
Invasive aspergillosis mortality in patients with haematologic malignancy or HSCT: In a 
registry-based study that collected data (2004-2007) from 21 tertiary care centres in Italy, Pa-
gano et al (2009) reported the overall mortality rate in patients with AML. Among 140 AML 
patients diagnosed with IA, overall mortality rate at day 120 of infection was 33%.18  In an-
other study conducted at a large tertiary care hospital in France, described earlier, all-cause 
mortality rate was 14% at 1 month and 38% at 3 months in patients with AML, and 6% at 1 
month and 53% at 3 months in patients with ALL. 7

In a study in TransNet sites in the US described above, after HSCT, mortality at 3 months 
following diagnosis of IA ranged from 53.8% in autologous transplants to 84.6% in unre-
lated-donor transplants. In an updated analysis, Kontoyiannis, et al reported an overall mor-
tality of patients with HSCT at 1-year of 74.6%.8 In a review article by Denning DW et al., 
the mean mortality rate in patients with HSCT (including recipients of autologous, alloge-
neic, and peripheral stern cell transplants) developing IA was 90% and ranged from 33% to 
100%.19
Invasive aspergillosis mortality in patients with SOT: In the TransNet data in the US, 
mortality at 3 months after diagnosis of IA ranged from 20% in lung transplant patients to 
66.7% in heart and kidney transplant patients.
Invasive aspergillosis mortality in patients co-infected with HIV: The prognosis is reported to 
be poor in patients co-infected with HIV and IA. In a study in Italy described earlier, the 
mean survival time was 2 to 4 months in patients co-infected with IA and HIV. Cause of 
death was directly related to aspergillosis in 62.9% (34/54) patients. 10 In the ASD study de-
scribed before, the median survival was 3 months after the diagnosis of aspergillosis in 228 
patients co-infected with aspergillosis and HIV. The percentage of patients alive 1 year after 
diagnosis of aspergillosis was 26% (95% CI: 20, 32).20  
Invasive aspergillosis mortality in patients admitted to an ICU: In a review of medical 
charts of ICU patients in a tertiary care hospital in Belgium between July 1997 and Decem-
ber 1999, 75.7% (28/37) patients died during their stay in ICU. 12

Table 1. Co-morbidity in the Target Population – Patients with Invasive Aspergillo-
sis
Hematologic malignancies or HSCT
The risk of IA among patients with HSCT is a function of neutropenia and/or immunodeficiency which makes 
them susceptible to infections including IA. Estimates from the TransNet Database, which enrolled HSCT re-
cipients with proven or probable invasive fungal infections between 2001 and 2006, suggest that IA remains 
the most common of all IFIs following HSCT. 8 The search identified one study that reported the proportion of 
patients with haematologic malignancy among patients diagnosed with IA.
In a retrospective study, conducted at the University Hospital Leuven, Belgium between January 1, 2000, and 
January 1, 2003, among 127 adult ICU patients with IA, 30% (38/127) patients had hematologic malignancy.21
Mortality: Mortality estimates in haematologic malignancy or HSCT patients infected with IA have been pre-
sented in Section SI.1.5
Co-prescribed medications: Persons with haematological malignancy have complex medication regimens that 
vary according to the lesion type, stage, and symptomatology. Immunosuppression-causing cytotoxic agents 
are at the core of curative chemotherapy. These patients also take antineoplastic agents for palliation along 
with an array of analgesics, sedatives, antidepressants, corticosteroids, and other anti-nausea drugs. Following 
are some of the co-prescribed medications.
Acute myelogenous leukaemia patients: Daunorubicin, mitroxantrone, idarubicin, cytarabine, imatinib.
Acute lymphocytic leukaemia patients: Cyclophosphamide, daunorubicin, vincristine, steroids, mercaptopu-
rine.
Bone Marrow Transplant patients: Busulfan, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, carmustine, cisplatin, cytara-
bine, melphalan, lomustine, antithymocyte globulin.
SOT
Patients with SOT are at much higher risk for IA infection than the general population. It has been well estab-
lished that the state of immunosuppression and the intensity of immunosuppressive regimen is a major determi-
nant of the development of IA in these high-risk patients. In a systematic review of published data that in-
cluded 1,941 patients with a diagnosis of aspergillosis, 252 (13%) of patients were SOT recipients.22
Mortality: Mortality estimates in SOT patients infected with IA have been presented in Section SI.1.5
Co-prescribed medications: SOT recipients require aggressive immunosuppressive therapy to prevent graft 
rejection. As a result, transplant patients commonly take calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., ciclosporin), antiprolifera-
tive agents (e.g., azathioprine), corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone), and various therapeutic antibodies.23 Because 
they are immunosuppressed, transplant recipients often require prophylactic anti-infective agents to prevent 
and treat opportunistic infections: antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral agents.
HIV infection
The search did not identify any study that reported the proportion of patients with HIV among patients diag-
nosed with IA. 
Mortality: Mortality estimates in HIV infected patients have been presented in Section SI.1.5
Co-prescribed medications: Patients with HIV, especially symptomatic disease, take aggressive multidrug 
antiretroviral regimens consisting of reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, and fusion inhibitors.24
Other drugs commonly used by this population include various anti-infective agents for prevention of oppor-
tunistic infections, antidepressants and anxiolytics, and drugs for treatment-induced dyslipidaemia. In a study 
conducted in Canada, 71% (10/14) of patients were neutropenic or on steroids including megestrol. Eight (8) 
patients were on ganciclovir at the time of diagnosis of aspergillosis. 
SI.2. Candidaemia in Non-Neutropenic Patients
Candidiasis is caused by a group of microscopic fungi or yeast and is associated with sub-
stantial morbidity and mortality, prolongation of hospital stay, and increased healthcare cost 
worldwide.

The section below summarizes summary of studies reporting candidaemia incidence, preva-
lence and mortality estimates from published literature. Search terms to identify relevant pa-
pers are mentioned below.5
Indication/target population
No study was found that reported the incidence of candidaemia in specifically “non neutro-
penic” patients. Below is a summary of studies reporting incidence of candidaemia in the 
general population in the EU and US, and specific patient subpopulations.
Europe 
The incidence (per 100,000 population) of candidaemia in the general population ranged 
from 1.4 to 4.9 in Iceland,25  3.5 in Spain,26  1.7 to 2.86 in Finland,27  2.4 in Norway28 and 
2.96 to 4.20 in Switzerland29. A meta-analysis30 of 25 population-based studies conducted in 
European population from January 2000 to February 2019 reported a pooled incidence of 
3.88 per 100,000 persons per year. 
In a nationwide study in Iceland, all patients infected with Candida spp. were identified by a 
nationwide search in microbiology databases from 01 January 1980 to 31 December 1999. 
During the 20-year period, annual incidence (per 100,000 population) of candidaemia in-
creased 3.5-fold, from 1.4 between 1980 and 1984 to 4.9 between 1995 and 1999.25 In an-
other study in Spain, mean annual incidence of candidaemia was 3.5 per 100,000 population 
between September 1997 and August 1999 were reported. In this study, the cases of candi-
daemia were identified from 19 hospitals across Spain. 26  Using data from the laboratory-
based surveillance program on candidaemia from June 2008 to June 2009 in 40 medical cen-
tres across Spain, an overall incidence of approximately 100 cases per 100,000 hospital ad-
missions was reported. Poikonen, et al analysed the laboratory-based surveillance data from 
the National Infectious Disease Register in Finland and reported the annual incidence (per 
100,000 population) of 1.7 in 1995 and 2.2 in 1999.27 In a large study in Norway, collecting 
data on cases of candidaemia from all microbiological laboratories across Norway, the aver-
age annual incidence between 1991 to 2003 was 2.4 per 100,000 population. 28 Data from the 
nation-wide Swiss Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance System from 2009 to 2018 suggested 
that the population-based incidence of candidemia (per 100,000 persons) increased from 2.96 
in 2009–2013 to 4.20 in 2014–2018.29
United States 
In a population-based surveillance program for candidaemia by the Centres for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention (CDC) in affiliation with academic medical intuitions, reported the inci-
dence of candidaemia in Atlanta and San Francisco. A total of 837 incident cases of candi-
daemia were identified between January 1992 and December 1993. 
5 Throughout the literature review, Candidemia was represented by the following Boolean search terms: 
[(candidemia OR invasive candidiasis OR blood Candida OR fungaemia) AND epidemiology OR population-
based OR incidence OR prevalence OR rates OR mortality)].

The average annual incidence (per 100,000 population) in Atlanta was 8.7 and in San Fran-
cisco was 7.1 during the study period.31
In a review paper by Pfaller, et al described earlier, estimates of candidaemia incidence from 
NHDS data were reported. 
The incidences of candidaemia were reported to be 23 per 100,000 population in 1996 and 29 
per 100,000 population in 2003 in the US general population. 1 Additionally, the MAH ana-
lysed the NHDS data using the same ICD-9 and estimated the incidence of candidaemia from 
2004 through 2007.

In 2017, in a population-based surveillance study for candidemia conducted by CDC32 en-
compassing 5% of the US population, 1,226 candidemia cases were identified with an esti-
mated incidence of 7 cases per 100,000 persons. Incidence rates were higher in adults aged ≥
65 years old (20.1/100,000), males (7.9/100,000), and those of black race (12.3/100,000).

2004 was estimated. Higher incidence observed in the latter 3 years of the study (3.7) com-
pared to the first 2 years (1.6).33
Incidence of candidaemia in patient subpopulations: A higher incidence of candidaemia 
in patients with immunocompromised status compared to general population status has been 
reported.

Patients with SOT: Candida species are a common cause of invasive fungal infections in 
patients with SOT. In the TransNet data, described earlier, the incidence of candidaemia in 
patients with SOT was reported to be approximately 1.9% at 12 month follow up.34  In a re-
view paper based on the literature, Paya, et al. reported that 32% of patients with heart trans-
plant, 60% to 100% with heart-lung transplant, 77% to 80% with lung transplant, and 60% 
with kidney transplant patients had candidaemia infection.35  
Patients with HIV infection: While anti-retroviral therapy reduces the risk of acquiring an 
opportunistic infection, candidiasis is a common cause of invasive fungal infections among 
patients with HIV/AIDS.36   In a retrospective study conducted over an 8-year period (1990–
1997) in a large hospital in Rome, Italy, 39 (1.2%) patients were diagnosed among 3292 
HIV-infected patients during the study period. The overall incidence of candidaemia was 1.1 
episodes per 100 persons per year in the study period. The incidence decreased from 1.4 epi-
sodes in the 1990 to 1996 period to 0.8 in 1997.37  In another population-based surveillance 
study in Barcelona, Spain 4% of patients with candidaemia had underlying HIV infection.38  
Similarly, in Northern Italy, 6% of patients infected with candidaemia had underlying HIV 
infection. 36
In an analysis of medical records of 400 HIV-positive patients at 2 institutions in Argentina, 
between 1985 and 1995, 1.25% (5/400) patients developed candidaemia.39  
Patients with haematologic malignancy or HSCT: Candidiasis is a common infection in 
patients with haematological malignancy or HSCT recipients. Below are a few studies report-
ing the incidence of candidaemia in patients with haematologic malignancies. 
In a retrospective study, the authors reviewed the medical records including microbiologic 
data of adult patients with haematologic malignancy with candidaemia at the University of 
Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center from March 2001 to February 2007. Over the 7-year 
period, 173 episodes of candidaemia were identified in 170 patients with haematologic ma-
lignancy. The incidence (per 100,000 inpatient days) of candidaemia was reported to be 13.9 
in 2001 and 23.2 in 2004. In the discussion section the author reported that these rates are 
higher than those reported from European surveys (2.6 to 7.3 per 100,000 inpatient days) and 
surveillance-based studies in the US.40  In a population-based survey of public and private 
microbiology laboratories in Australia, a total of 1095 incident cases of candidaemia were 
identified; 288 (26%) episodes occurred in 288 adults with cancer. Among them, 138 had 
haematological malignancies. 40
Patients with Diabetes: Patients with diabetes are susceptible to systemic infection caused 
by Candida species. In a study conducted in the US, the average incidence of candidaemia 
was 28 per 100,000 population among adults (> 18 years) with diabetes. 31
The following table summarizes the incidence of candidaemia reported in the general popula-
tion in the EU and US.

SI.2.3. Demographics of the population in the authorised indication, age, gender, racial 
and/or ethnic origin and risk factors for the disease 
Age: In the majority of the population-based surveillance studies, the highest incidence of 
candidaemia occurs at the extremes of the age spectrum. For example, in a study in Spain, 
the age-specific incidence (per 100,000 population) was highest in infants (38.8) compared to 
those aged > 65 years (12.0).41 In a study in Norway, the average annual incidences vary sub-
stantially between the various age groups. The incidence (candidaemia episodes per 100,000 
population) was reported to be the highest in patients aged  1 year (10.3), and very low 
(from 0.5 to 1.3) in the age group between >1 and 39 years. Thereafter, there is a gradual in-
crease with age from 1.7 in patients aged 40 to 49 years to 7.4 in patients aged 70 to 79 years 
and 8.4 in patients aged  80 years.

Similarly, in the CDC study in Atlanta and San Francisco, California described before, the 
incidence (per 100,000 population) was highest in children < 1 year and elderly aged  65 
years compared to other age group. 31  In another study in Iowa, 67% of the cases with candi-
daemia were aged 50 or above. 
Sex: The majority of studies reported higher candidaemia incidence (or proportion of cases 
among all candidaemia patients) among males than females.
In a study in Spain described earlier, the majority of cases of candidaemia were in males 
(65%).26 In a nationwide study in Norway, of the 1381 candidaemia episodes with adequate 
patient information, 58% of the patients were in males and 42% were in females. 
In the CDC study in Atlanta, Georgia and San Francisco, California US, the incidence per 
100,000 was higher among males than females (9 vs. 6).31 Similarly, in the study in Iowa, 
more males than females (59% vs. 41%) were reported. However, no significant difference in 
candidaemia rate between males and females was found in a study in Baltimore, Maryland 
and Connecticut. 
Race: Estimates on the incidence of candidaemia by race are limited in the published litera-
ture. In the CDC study described above, overall incidence (per 100,000 population) was 
twice as high among Blacks as Whites (12 vs. 6) in all age groups, and 4 folds higher among 
Black infants (0 to 12 months) than among White infants (165 vs. 41).31
Diagnosis of candidaemia (in-patient vs. outpatient setting): The majority of patients with 
candidaemia reported in the reviewed studies were diagnosed in an inpatient setting. 
In the study in Iowa, 56% of candidaemia cases in a general medicine ward, 40% in an ICU 
and only 4% were diagnosed in an outpatient setting. 31
Risk Factors for the Disease
Potential health risk for Invasive Aspergillosis, Candidaemia in Non-Neutropenic Patients, 
Fluconazole-Resistant Serious Invasive Candida Infections (Including C. krusei), Serious 
Fungal Infections Caused by Scedosporium spp. and Fusarium spp.
SI.2.4. The main existing treatment options summarise the standard of care, with the 
view of the expected safety profile and outcome in the absence of treatment with the 
medicinal product
There are multiple treatment options for invasive candidiasis and candidaemia in non-neutro-
penic adult patients. Available therapies have been recently reviewed by a panel of European 
experts and published.42  
The recommendations are graded by strength (from A- strongly supports a recommendation 
to use to D- supports a recommendation against use) and ranked according to level of scien-
tific evidence (I- strongest to III- weakest).

Voriconazole has been granted a BI recommendation. Echinocandins (anidulafungin 
(Ecalta®, Pfizer), caspofungin (Cancidas®, Merck and Co.) and micafungin (Mycamine®, 
Astellas Pharma Europe) were recommended with AI level for initial targeted treatment of 
candidaemia and invasive candidiasis in adult patients. Other options for the treatment of in-
vasive candidiasis and candidaemia in non-neutropenic adult patients include amphotericin B 
liposomal (BI), fluconazole (CI) and amphotericin B lipid complex (CII). Amphotericin B 
deoxycholate (alone or in combination with fluconazole or flucytosine) and efungumab plus 
lipid-associated amphotericin B, amphotericin B colloidal dispersion and itraconazole were 
granted a recommendation against use (DI for the 2 first and DII others). Posaconazole was 
ranked DIII because of lack of data reported by the authors of the guidelines.
SI.2.5. Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including 
mortality and morbidity:
Discuss the possible stages of disease progression to be treated and applied to the natural his-
tory of the indication in the (untreated) population. This section should also describe con-
cisely the relevant adverse events to be anticipated in the (untreated) targeted population in 
EU, their frequency and their characteristics. 
A few studies reported the mortality rate in patients with candidaemia.
Europe
Three (3) studies were identified that reported the mortality rate of candidaemia in the EU. In 
a study in Barcelona Spain, 44% (150/341) patients died within 30 days; 74 (22%) died 
within 7 days of the diagnosis of candidaemia. In another study in Spain, the crude candidae-
mia mortality rate was 40.6%: 41.4% in adults and 32.5% in infants.26 In a nationwide study 
in Spain, the crude mortality associated with candidaemia was 20.20%. 
In the European Confederation of Medical Mycology (ECMM) survey, the crude mortality in 
patients with candidaemia was approximately 35%.43
United States
Using the multiple cause-of-death and the US general population estimate from the Bureau of 
Census, Pfaller, et al reported candidaemia mortality rates (per 100,000 population) of about 
0.7 in 1991 and 0.4 in 1997 and 2003.1
In the CDC study in Atlanta and San Francisco described above, of 837 cases of candidae-
mia, 88.5% (741/837) patients had the outcome information. Of these 741 patients, 29% 
(240/837) died. 31 In another study in Baltimore and Connecticut (October 1998 to September 
2000), 409 patients from a total of 1143 patients died within 30 days of the diagnosis of can-
didaemia, for an overall crude mortality rate of about 36%.

Candidaemia mortality rate in patient subpopulations: Mortality rates of candidaemia 
vary by patients underlying conditions. The ECMM hospital based surveillance survey indi-
cated the highest 30-day mortality rates of candidaemia occurred in patients with solid tu-
mours (49.2%), haematological malignancy (44.5%) or in patients treated in ICUs (42.4%).43
In the TransNet data in the US described earlier, the overall 1-year mortality among HSCT 
patients with candidaemia was 66.4%.8
In a 2-year prospective study of candidaemia in Sweden, the 30-day mortality rate was 39% 
in surgical patients and 32% in ICU patients.45   
Similar rates were reported from the ECMM hospital-based surveillance survey; the 30-day 
mortality rate of candidaemia was 42.4% in ICU-treated patients and 35.3% in surgical pa-
tients. 43 A higher rate was reported from Spain where the 30-day mortality rate was 50% in 
adult ICU patients with candidaemia. 26
The ECMM hospital-based surveillance survey indicated the 30-day mortality rate of candi-
daemia was 23.4% in patients with HIV infection. 43 In the Highly Active Antiretroviral 
Therapy study, the overall mortality rate in patients co-infected with candidaemia and HIV 
was 59%. In another retrospective chart review of all patients diagnosed with candidaemia 
among HIV infected patients in Saint Michael’s Medical Center, New Jersey, US described 
before, 36% (4/11) patients co-infected with candidaemia and HIV died.46

In a study in the US, on 87 patients with diabetes mellitus and candidaemia, the overall mor-
tality was 39% (34/87); nosocomial candidaemia was an independent risk factor of mortality 
[OR = 10.2 (95% CI: 1.1, 97.9)].47   
Factors associated with candidaemia mortality: Independent risk factors of death from 
candidaemia include older age (> 65 years), procedures associated with intensive care (e.g., 
central venous catheters, total parenteral nutrition), and severity of underlying illness.48  De-
lays in initiation of treatment and inappropriate (or inadequate) treatment of fungal infections 
in patients with candidaemia also have a significant impact on mortality.49  
SI.2.6. Important co-morbidities:
Generally, candidiasis is not a disease seen in normal healthy hosts; rather, there is a large 
number of reasonably well-characterized risk factors. 
Some of the risk factors are other diseases or the degree of severity of the underlying illness, 
while others are induced by various therapies. Major predisposing factors (i.e., disease/condi-
tions or risk factors) of candidaemia are listed below. 68 69 50

Table 2. Co-morbidity in the Target Population – Patients with Candidaemia
Indication/target population
Haematologic malignancies or HSCT
The search identified two studies that reported the proportion of patients with haematologic malignancy among 
patients diagnosed with candidaemia. In a study in adult patients admitted to the ICUs in Dijon University Hos-
pital in France between 1990 and 2000, of 51 patients identified with candidaemia, haematological malignancy 
was the underlying condition in 43.1% (22/51) of patients. 43
In another study in Virgen del Rocío University Hospital in Spain from January 2004 to June 2009, 35.39% 
(80/226) of the patients with candidaemia had active malignancy.
Mortality: Section SI.2.5 summarizes studies that reported mortality estimates of candidaemia in patients hae-
matologic malignancy or HSCT.
Surgery
The combination of surgical procedures along with a prolonged hospital stay and use of invasive devices place 
the patient at risk for invasive fungal infections including candidaemia. A few studies were identified that re-
ported the rate of candidaemia in patients underwent surgical procedure(s). Below is a summary of studies that 
reported proportion of candidaemia patients that had surgeries.
In a study in the Dijon University Hospital in France, described earlier, 51 ICU patients were identified with 
candidaemia. Of 51 patients, 60.8% (31/51) were considered as surgical patients and 39.2% (20/51) were con-
sidered as medical patients. 43
In a study in the US, medical records were examined for all surgical patients having cultures positive for Can-
dida spp. between 1973 and 1980. Of the 159 patients identified, 29.5% (47/159) patients were in surgical 
wards.51
Similarly, in a study in Virgen del Rocío University Hospital in Spain described earlier, 42.9% of the patients 
with candidaemia had a surgery. 53
Mortality: Refer to Section SI.2.5
Co-prescribed medications: Overall, surgical patients receive multiple medications: analgesics, and antibiot-
ics. Treatment resistant pathogens are increasingly common requiring more aggressive medical therapy, which 
often results in combination anti-infective regimens.
SOT
The search identified one study that reported the proportion of patients with SOT among patients diagnosed 
with candidaemia: in the study in Virgen del Rocío University Hospital, Spain described earlier, 2.65% of the 
patients with candidaemia infection were in SOT recipients.
Mortality: Refer to Section SI.2.5
HIV infection
The search did not identify any study that reported the proportion of patients with HIV infected among candi-
daemia patients.
Mortality: Refer to Section SI.2.5
Diabetes
A higher rate of candidaemia in patients with diabetes has been reported compared to the general population. In 
a retrospective review of invasive fungal infections among university hospitals in France, 8% of patients with 
candidiasis had underlying diabetes mellitus.52
Mortality: Refer to Section SI.2.5
Co-prescribed medications: Patients with diabetes use many medications, both to treat hyperglycaemia and 
for the prevention and treatment of diseases (as a consequence of diabetes) like cardiovascular and kidney dis-
ease. Most commonly, persons with diabetes take oral antihyperglycemics, insulin, HMG CoA-reductase inhib-
itors (statins), antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), and antihypertensives, especially angiotensin converting en-
zyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers.

SI.3. Fluconazole-Resistant Serious Invasive Candida Infections (Including C. krusei)
Fluconazole is an important antifungal compound in the treatment of candidiasis. With in-
creasing use of broad spectrum antibacterial in recent decades, there has been an increase in 
rates of resistance to azoles antibiotics including fluconazole. 
Important risk factors for fluconazole resistant Candida spp. include prior treatment with az-
ole (particularly fluconazole), recent gastrointestinal tract surgery and neutropenia.53
Below is the epidemiology of fluconazole-resistant Candida infections. Search terms to iden-
tify relevant papers are mentioned below.8
Indication/target population
No study was found that reported the population-based incidence of fluconazole resistant 
candidiasis in the EU and US general population. A few studies reported the proportion of 
patients infected with decreased fluconazole susceptibility and/or fluconazole resistant Can-
dida spp. in all patients with candidiasis in the EU and US.
SI.3.1. Incidence 
Europe
Two studies were identified reporting the proportion of patients with fluconazole resistance 
in all patients with candidiasis in the EU. 
A study conducted in Virgen del Rocío University Hospital, a large urban hospital with 
teaching accreditation in Spain from January 2004 to June 2009, reported the proportion of 
patients with fluconazole resistance Candida infection. During the study period, 229 episodes 
of candidaemia were identified. Of 226 episodes of candidaemia, 13.27% (30/266) isolates 
showed fluconazole resistance. The species isolated from the fluconazole resistance Candida
spp. were C. glabrata (n = 14), C. krusei (n = 14), and C. tropicalis (n = 2).53 In a nationwide 
study in Spain described before, overall, decreased susceptibility to fluconazole was reported 
in 7.01% isolates of candidaemia. 
In a surveillance program for fungaemia in Denmark, fungal isolates were tested for antimi-
crobial susceptibility during 2004 and 2006. About 32% of the isolates tested showed de-
creased susceptibility to fluconazole and/or itraconazole (defined as a minimum inhibitory 
concentration (MIC) of > 8 mg⁄L and > 0.125 mg⁄L, respectively). Separate estimate for flu-
conazole resistant isolates was not reported.54
8 Throughout the literature review, fluconazole-resistant serious invasive Candida infections (including C. 
krusei) was represented by the following Boolean search terms: [( resistant candidemia OR fluconazole-re-
sistant fungaemia OR fluconazole-resistant fungal infection ) AND epidemiology OR population-based OR in-

United States
In the SENTRY Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Program, which was designed to 
monitor the predominant pathogens and antimicrobial resistance for both nosocomial and 
community-acquired infections worldwide in 1997, in vitro susceptibility testing of 203 iso-
lates of Candida spp. against fluconazole from the US showed that 2.5 % were resistant to 
fluconazole at the published National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards MIC in-
terpretive breakpoint concentrations (i.e., MIC  64 mg/mL).55
A higher rate of fluconazole resistant Candida spp. has been reported in patients with haema-
tologic malignancy. Of the 168 Candida isolates tested in a retrospective study among hae-
matologic malignancy patients with candidaemia at The University of Texas MD. Anderson 
Cancer Center from March 2001 to February 2007, 48 (29%) were resistant or susceptible-
dose–dependent in vitro to fluconazole.56
Global
Among 13,338 bloodstream infections (BSI) attributable to Candida spp. (12 species from > 
200 institutions worldwide) tested at the University of Iowa between 1992 and 2004, < 3% 
showed resistance to fluconazole (MIC > 64 g/mL) in all Candida spp., with the exception of 
C. glabrata (9%) and C. krusei (40%).1
The longitudinal nature of the ARTEMIS DISK Surveillance Program in 127 medical centres 
in 39 countries also provides trends over a 6.5-year period (from 1997 through 2003) in flu-
conazole resistance among clinical isolates of Candida spp. (e.g., blood, sterile sites, etc.) all 
tested by a single standardized agar disk diffusion method. Among the 10 Candida spp., the 
fluconazole resistance across various centres ranged among isolates of C. albicans (0.8% to 
1.5%), C. tropicalis (3.0% to 6.6%), C. parapsilosis (2.0% to 4.2%), C. lusitaniae (1.6% to 
6.6%), and C. kefyr (0.0% to 5.7%). 
Additionally, elevated rates of resistance were observed among isolates of C. glabrata
(14.3% to 22.8%), C. guilliermondii (6.3% to 26.1%), C. rugosa (14.3% to 66.0%), and C. 
famata (9.8% to 47.4%) during the study period. 1
In the SENTRY Program described above, 1.6% BSI Candida isolates tested in Canada and 
2.4% in South America, showed resistance to fluconazole at MIC  64 mg/ml. 55
In another population-based surveillance program of candidiasis in Calgary Health Region, 
Canada about 30% (56/184) of isolates demonstrated reduced susceptibility to fluconazole. 
Of them, 43 were susceptible dose-dependent and 13 were resistant. 33

Age: Fluconazole resistant candidiasis is reported to be higher in adult patients compared to 
children. In a study conducted in Virgen del Rocío University Hospital in Spain from January 
2004 to June 2009 described earlier, median age of patients with fluconazole resistant Can-
dida spp. was 58 years. 53
Sex: A higher proportion of male patients than females with fluconazole resistant Candida
infection have been reported. In a study in Spain described above, 60% of patients with flu-
conazole resistant Candida infection were males. 53
Race: A higher rate of fluconazole resistant Candida infection in Blacks has been found in 
one study. In an active laboratory-based surveillance study conducted from October 1998 
through September 2000 in 2 areas of the US (Baltimore, MD., and Connecticut; combined 
population, 4.7 million), Black race was identified a risk factor for fluconazole resistant Can-
dida spp. in the univariate analysis. Of 35 patients with fluconazole resistant Candida infec-
tion, 60% (21/35) were black.

A high mortality rate in patients with fluconazole resistant candidiasis has been observed in 
studies. In a nationwide candidaemia study in Australia, of the 39 patients with a flucona-
zole-resistant isolate, 19 were initially treated with fluconazole and 6 (32%) died by day 30. 
Additional 15 patients received other antifungal agents (9 amphotericin B-based products, 3 
caspofungin, 2 itraconazole, and 1 voriconazole) and 8/15 (53%) died by day 30.40

evant papers are mentioned below.10
SI.4.1. Incidence 
Scedosporium spp
The majority of the published literature on Scedosporium spp. consists of single case reports 
and small case series. No study was identified reporting incidence of Scedosporium in the 
general population in the EU and US. Additionally, the analysis of US NHDS data by the

MAH described earlier revealed only one case of Scedosporium reported between 2004 and 
2007.
Global 
In a survey including 49 laboratories across Australia, 180 cases with 118 (65.6%) cases of 
colonization and 62 (34.4%) cases of invasive infection with Scedosporium spp. in a 3-year 
(2003 to 2005) time period were identified.57
Scedosporium infection in patient subpopulations: A few papers were found that reported 
proportion of patients infected with Scedosporium spp. in all fungal isolates in patient sub-
populations. 
Scedosporium infection in patients with haematological malignancy or HSCT: In a retro-
spectively review of all new cases of mould infections in patients with acute leukaemia, a to-
tal of 8,633 patients with a newly diagnosed acute leukaemia (6,303 myeloid and 2,330 lym-
phoid) were identified in Italy between 1998 and 2003 (expect 1998).58  In 542 patients with 
proven or probable mould infections, only 0.9% (5/542 or approximately 900 per 100,000) 
cases of proven scedosporiosis were diagnosed. 
In a study conducted at the MD. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, incidence (per 
100,000 patient-inpatient days) of Scedosporium infection of 0.82 from 1993 to 1998, and of 
1.33 from 1999 to 2005 among patients with cancer was reported.59   
In another study from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) in Seattle, 
Washington, 9 HSCT recipients developed invasive fungal infection due to the Scedosporium
spp. over 15 years from 1985 to 1999.60  
Scedosporium infection in patients with SOT: In a retrospective review of the literature in 
SOT recipients between 1976 and 1999 in Pittsburgh, PA, Castiglioni, et al reported 23 cases 
of S. apiospermum infections with an overall incidence of 100 cases per 100,000 patients. 
The median time to diagnosis of infection was 4 months (range, 0.4 to 156 months) following 
transplant.61  
In another review of lung and heart-lung transplant patients between 1986 and 1999 in Aus-
tralia, 7 of 330 (2.3%) had pulmonary scedosporiosis. 60

Serious fungal infections caused by Fusarium spp.
The majority of the published literature on Fusarium spp. consists of case reports, small case 
series and reports in patient subpopulations. The search did not identify any paper reporting 
the incidence of Fusarium infection in the general population of EU. 
The analysis of US NHDS by the MAH showed that the incidence (per 100,000 population) 
of Fusarium was 0.03 in 2004 and 0.09 in 2007.

Fusarium infection in patient subpopulations: Immunocompromised patients are at high 
risk for Fusarium spp. particularly those with prolonged neutropenia and/or severe T-cell im-
munodeficiency. A few papers were found that reported proportion of patients infected with 
Fusarium spp. in patient subpopulations.
Fusarium infection in patients with haematological malignancy or HSCT: fusariosis has been 
considered an emerging infection in patients with haematological malignancies. In a multi-
centre retrospective study on fungal infections from 14 haematology departments over a pe-
riod of 10 years (from 1988 to 1997) in Italy, the incidence of Fusarium infections in patients 
with haematological malignancy was 0.06% (60 cases per 100,000).62  In a study in HSCT 
recipients from 9 hospitals (2 in the US and 7 in Brazil), the overall incidence (per 100,000 
population) of fusariosis was reported to be ~ 597 patients; the incidence was lowest (~ 150 
to 200) in autologous recipients, intermediate (~ 250 to 500) in matched related and matched 
unrelated allogeneic recipients, and highest (2000) among recipients of mismatched related 
donor allogeneic HSCTs. 
In a review of medical records of patients at MD. Anderson Cancer Center, at the University 
of Texas, 43 patients with positive cultures for Fusarium spp. between January 1986 and De-
cember 1995 were identified. All patients were immunocompromised.63  
In another study at the same institute, Campo and colleagues reviewed records (1998 to 
2009) of patients with haematologic malignancy and found that 44 patients were infected 
with Fusarium spp. Of the 44 patients, 37/44 (84%) had acute leukaemia/myelodysplastic 
syndrome, with the remaining 7/44 (16%) of patients with lymphoma or chronic leukaemia 
as their underlying disease.64
Fusarium infection in patients with SOT: No study was identified reporting the rates of 
Fusarium infection in patients with SOT. The majority of the literature on Fusarium infec-
tion in humans consists of single case reports.

subpopulations.
SI.4.3. Demographics of the population in the authorised indication, age, gender, racial 
and/or ethnic origin and risk factors for the disease  
Serious fungal infections caused by Scedosporium spp.
Age: In the study described earlier, Caira and colleagues performed a literature search and 
summarized demographic characteristics of 52 cases of patients infected with Scedosporium
spp. from 29 reports in patients with acute leukaemia over the last 30 years. Mean age of the 
patients was 47 years (range 3 to 79 years). 
In a literature review of 162 cases of Scedosporium, the median age of patients was 45 years 
(ranging from a few months to 81 years).65  
Sex: Much higher rates of Scedosporium infection among males than females have been re-
ported.
In the study by Caira and colleagues described above, male/female ratio was 1.9:1.13
In a literature review of 162 cases of Scedosporium described above, 102 (63%) infections 
were diagnosed in males. 
Serious fungal infections caused by Fusarium spp.
Age: In a study in Israel, the mean age of the patients with Fusarium was 57 years (range 0 to 
92 years.66  In a study in HSCT recipients from US and Brazil, the median age of patients in-
fected with Fusarium was 34 years (range 2 to 67 years).67  
Sex: In a study in HSCT recipients from 9 hospitals (2 in the US and 7 in Brazil) described 
above, 55.7% (34/61) of patients infected with Fusarium were males and 44.24% (27/61) 
were females.68

Similarly, in a study conducted in a large tertiary care hospital in Israel described above, a 
total of 89 patients were identified with Fusarium infection. About 52% (47/89) of patients 
were male patients.69  
SI.4.4. The main existing treatment options summarise the standard of care, with the 
view of the expected safety profile and outcome in the absence of treatment with the 
medicinal product
The antifungal armamentarium for the treatment of fusariosis is more restricted and the data 
more scarse, as no randomized study has been conducted.70  Voriconazole is considered as 
the drug of choice and alternatives consist of amphotericin B (deoxycholate and lipid formu-
lations) and posaconazole.
The treatment of scedosporiosis is very difficult due to the resistance of the Scedosporium
spp. to many antifungal agents. Besides voriconazole, there are reports of successful treat-
ment with combinations including terbinafine and another antifungal agents.71
SI.4.5. Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including 
mortality and morbidity:
A high mortality rate in patients infected with Scedosporium spp. has been observed in stud-
ies.
In a study at the University of Texas MD. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, the 12-
week mortality rates were 70% and 100% for S. apiospermum and S. prolificans infection, 
respectively. 59
In a study from the FHCRC in Seattle, WA, described before, all 9 HSCT recipient patients 
died within 1 month following the diagnosis of Scedosporium infection. In another study, the 
mortality rate in patients infected with Scedosporium among SOTs was 54% (31/57): 77.8% 
for patients with S. prolificans infection, and 54.5% for patients with S. apiospermum infec-
tions.72
In a literature review of 162 cases of Scedosporium, the overall mortality was 46.9%; the 
mortality rate was 87.5% in patients with disseminated disease.
Serious fungal infections caused by Fusarium spp.
In a retrospective review of medical charts by Campo, et al, the crude mortality rate in pa-
tients with fusariosis at 12 weeks was 66%.64 In the TransNet data in the US described ear-
lier, the overall 1-year mortality among HSCT patients with Fusarium infections was 
93.7%.8 In another retrospective cohort study conducted between January 1999 and Decem-
ber 2003 in Italy, the attributable mortality rates associated with fusariosis was 53%.6

Haematologic malignancies or HSCT
The search identified two studies that reported the proportion of patients with malignancy or HSCT among pa-
tients with Scedosporium spp. infection. In a literature review of 162 cases of patients infected with 
Scedosporium, 45.7% (74/162) had malignancy. In a study conducted at the MD. Anderson Cancer Center, 
Houston, Texas, described earlier, all 25 patients that met criteria for probable or definite Scedosporium infec-
tion had a diagnosis of haematologic malignancy, and 12 were BMT recipients. 59
SOT
The search identified one study that reported the proportion of patients with SOT among patients with 
Scedosporium spp. infection. Hussain, et al identified a total of 80 transplant recipients with Scedosporium in-
fections (13 from University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, PA, University of Maryland, Baltimore, Duke Uni-
versity Medical Center, Durham, NC, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, and Hospital Gregorio Maran˜o´n, Ma-
drid, Spain and 67 reported in the literature). Of 80 transplant recipients with Scedosporium infections, 71.25% 
(57/80) were in SOTs. 
Mortality: Refer to Section SI.4.5
Co-prescribed medications: Alemtuzumab is being increasingly used for the prevention and/or treatment of 
acute allograft rejection in organ transplant recipients.73 In a study in SOT described earlier, 50% of the pa-
tients had received cyclosporine A, 36% had received tacrolimus. 72

Table 6. Key Safety Findings and Relevance to Human Usage
Key Safety findings from Non-clinical Studies
Relevance to Human Usage
No adequate information on the use of voricona-
zole in pregnant women is available. The potential 
risk to humans is unknown. Effects in pregnancy
is a missing information (see 0); SmPC provides 
information to the prescriber in Section 4.6 Preg-
nancy and lactation and Section 5.3 Preclinical 
safety data.
Voriconazole must not be used during pregnancy 
unless the benefit to the mother clearly outweighs 
the potential risk to the foetus. Women of 
childbearing potential must always use effective 
contraception during treatment. Effects in preg-
nancy is a missing information (see 0.)
Hepatotoxicity occurred at exposure levels several 
times higher than those observed in human pa-
tients at the standard maintenance dose of 200 mg 
oral bid (AUC (0-12) 13.7 g•h/mL; protocol # 
A1501092). In clinical trials, there have been un-
common cases of serious hepatic reactions during 
treatment with voriconazole which were noted in 
patients with serious underlying medical condi-
tions (predominantly haematological malignancy). 
Hepatic reactions, including hepatitis and jaun-
dice, have occurred among patients with no other 
identifiable risk factors. Liver dysfunction has 
usually been revisable upon discontinuation of 
therapy. Hepatic toxicity is an important identified 
risk (see Module SVII).
A clinical study to assess the cardiovascular risk 
of voriconazole in humans has been conducted at 
high oral voriconazole doses (up to 1600 mg). Ar-
rhythmias have not been observed in humans at 
rates greater than those seen in clinical studies 
with other approved antifungals, consistent with 
results from nonclinical studies that suggest a 
safety margin for this effect exists. QTc prolonga-
tion is an important identified risk (see Module 
SVII).
Reproductive Toxicity: 
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity at 
high doses of voriconazole.
Developmental toxicity: In reproduction studies, 
voriconazole was shown to be teratogenic in rats and 
embryotoxic in rabbits at systemic exposures equal to 
those obtained in humans with therapeutic doses. In the 
pre and postnatal development study in rats at expo-
sures lower than those obtained in humans with thera-
peutic doses, voriconazole prolonged the duration of 
gestation and labor and produced dystocia with conse-
quent maternal mortality and reduced perinatal survival 
of pups. The effects on parturition are probably medi-
ated by species-specific mechanisms, involving reduc-
tion of oestradiol levels, and are consistent with those 
observed with other azole antifungal agents
Hepatotoxicity: Functional and adaptive changes to the 
liver were seen in repeat dose rodent and non-rodent 
studies with voriconazole.
Cardiovascular Changes in QTc interval and heart rate 
have been observed in dogs following voriconazole ad-
ministration. Arrhythmias have occurred in the presence 
of high plasma voriconazole concentrations. All cardio-
vascular effects of voriconazole were reversible.

A transient visual disturbance may occur shortly 
after administration of voriconazole. The mecha-
nism is unknown, but functional effects occur at 
the level of retina and involve reversible decreases 
in the amplitude of the ERG waveform and colour 
discrimination. The symptoms usually diminish 
on repeated dosing and may be of clinical signifi-
cance in ambulatory patients, who should be ad-
vised not to drive or operate machinery while af-
fected. There is no long-term structural effect to 
the eye in long term animal toxicology studies and 
the visual disturbance results in few discontinua-
tions in clinical studies. Overall, the visual effects 
are not considered to represent an issue for long-
term use of voriconazole. Visual events is an im-
portant identified risk (see Module SVII).
Although phototoxicity has been observed in hu-
mans, in the non-clinical 3T3 neutral red uptake 
assay neither voriconazole nor N-oxide voricona-
zole were shown to be phototoxic. Phototoxicity is 
an important identified risk (see Module SVII).
Visual Effects In anaesthetised dogs voriconazole had a 
distinct effect on ERG (dose-related reductions in the 
amplitude and implicit time of the a-wave and reduc-
tions in the amplitude and slope of the b-wave) at 
plasma concentrations of 4.5, 9.5, and 16 µg/ml. These 
results confirm the retina as the site of action of 
voriconazole and are consistent with effects observed in 
humans
Phototoxicity: voriconazole N-oxide, the major circu-
lating metabolite in humans and preclinical species was 
shown to absorb UV light at 310 nm indicting the po-
tential to be a mediator of phototoxicity if it were to 
reach sites exposed to sunlight. An in vitro 3T3 neutral 
red uptake assay to determine the phototoxic potential 
of voriconazole and its N-oxide metabolite has been 
completed. Neither cytotoxicity nor phototoxicity was 
observed for either voriconazole or voriconazole N-ox-
ide indicating a lack of phototoxicity potential when 
tested to the limits of solubility or the maximum recom-
mended concentration of 1000 mg/L.

a. Dosing with voriconazole was to commence by the intravenous route every 12 hours. The first 2 doses, on Day 1, were 
to be 6 mg/kg body weight and subsequent doses, from Day 2 onward, were 3 mg/kg body weight twice daily. Intravenous 
dosing could continue for a maximum of 28 days.
b. After between 7 and 28 days of intravenous dosing, it was recommended that subjects switch to oral administration at a 
dose of 200 mg twice daily.

Rationale (if not included as
missing information)
Clinical studies have shown that there was 
greater than 3-fold increase in voriconazole total 
exposure in subjects with mild or moderate he-
patic impairment (Child Pugh class A or B) com-
pared to healthy subjects receiving the same sin-
gle oral dose.  In addition, subjects with moder-
ate hepatic impairment receiving half the recom-
mended oral maintenance dose had similar 
steady-state voriconazole exposure to those in 
healthy subjects receiving the full dose, but their 
exposures on day 1 receiving half the recom-
mended oral loading dose was lower than those 
in healthy subjects receiving the standard loading 
dose.  Therefore, it is recommended that the 
standard loading dose regimens be used but that 
the maintenance dose be halved in patients with 
mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A 
and B) receiving voriconazole.
Voriconazole has not been studied in patients 
with severe hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class 
C) or in patients with chronic hepatitis B or 
chronic hepatitis C.  There is limited data on the 
safety of voriconazole in patients with abnormal 
liver function tests AST, ALT, ALP, or total bili-
rubin >5 times the upper limit of normal).
Voriconazole has been associated with elevations 
in liver function tests and clinical signs of liver 
damage, such as jaundice, and should only be 
used in patients with severe hepatic impairment if 
the benefit outweighs the potential risk.

Rationale (if not included as

In patients with moderate to severe renal dys-

occurs. Oral voriconazole should be administered 
to these patients unless an assessment of the ben-

nous voriconazole. Serum creatinine levels 
should be closely monitored in these patients, 
and, if increases occur, consideration should be 
given to changing to oral voriconazole therapy. 
There are limited safety data with SBECD in hu-

SIV.3. Limitations in Respect to Populations Typically Under-Represented in Clinical 
Trial Development Programmes
Children
The safety and efficacy of voriconazole in children below 2 years has not been established. 
Overall, a total of 105 paediatric subjects (2 to < 18 years) received voriconazole in the thera-
peutic clinical studies. During the initial clinical development of voriconazole, no dedicated 
controlled clinical studies were conducted in the paediatric population. Safety and efficacy 
data in the paediatric population for the treatment of IA, ICC and EC, were available for a 
limited number of adolescents (12 to <18 years) who were included in the adult therapeutic 
studies (n=52 from Studies 150-303, 304, 305, 307, 309, 602, 603, 604, and 608). The me-
dian duration of treatment in adults (N=1,603) in these studies was 16 days (range: 1-326 
days). The median duration of treatment in paediatrics (N=52) was 41 days (range: 1-180 
days). Clinical data from these 52 subjects demonstrated that the safety and efficacy of 
voriconazole in the paediatric population were generally similar to those observed in adult 
subjects enrolled in those studies. 
An additional 53 paediatric subjects (25 subjects aged 2 to <12 years and, 28 subjects aged 
12 to <18 years), were included in two recently completed studies [A1501080 (subjects with 
IA) and A1501085 (subjects with ICC or EC)] for voriconazole therapeutic use. The median 
duration of treatment in studies A1501080 and A1501085 was 41 days (range: 3-95) and 15.5 
days (range: 2-62), respectively. The overall safety profile of paediatric subjects in these 
studies was similar to that of adults except for a higher frequency of subjects with liver-re-
lated AEs observed in both studies (29% in Study A1501080 and 36.4% in Study A1501085) 
compared to that reported in the adult therapeutic studies (24.1%). The nature and severity of 
hepatic-related AEs in the paediatric patients in these 2 studies were consistent with the 
known safety profile of voriconazole as observed in the adult therapeutic studies. No fatal 
outcome was reported for any of the hepatic related AEs. No cases of liver failure were re-
ported. 
The safety profile of 158 paediatric subjects aged 2 to <12 years were also evaluated in 
voriconazole compassionate use program for treatment in invasive fungal infections. The 
safety profile of paediatric subjects was similar to adults.
A total of 183 paediatric subjects (143 subjects aged 2 to <12 years and 40 subjects aged 12 
to <18 years) received voriconazole in the clinical studies for prophylaxis of invasive fungal 
infections. One hundred and seventy-four (174) paediatric subjects received voriconazole for 
prophylaxis in six pharmacokinetic studies, as reported in Table 14. Additional nine paediat-
ric subjects (aged 12 to <18 years) were included in adult prophylaxis study (A1501073).

An integrated pooled population pharmacokinetic analysis of four of the paediatric PK stud-
ies (A1501007, A1501037, A1501081 and A1501088), together with a pharmacokinetic 
study in 35 healthy adults (A1501092 provided adult comparison data) enabled further opti-
mization of the voriconazole paediatric dosing regimen, which supported a variation for a 
dosing update in paediatric subjects (EMEA/H/C/387/II/83, 2011).  
A pooled analysis of the safety data of paediatric subjects included in clinical trials (n= 288; 
105 from therapeutic use and 183 from prophylaxis use) was also performed by the MAH. 
The frequency and severity of all-causality AEs and important identified and potential risks 
associated with voriconazole (refer to Module SVIII Summary of the Safety Concerns) for 
the pooled paediatric populations were reviewed and compared to adults (n=1,873; 1,603 
from therapeutic use and 270 from prophylaxis use). No new safety information was identi-
fied. The adverse event profile in these 288 paediatric subjects was in general similar to that 
in adults. However, similar to studies A1501080 and A1501085, a higher frequency of liver-
related AEs13  mainly associated to elevated liver enzymes (increased ALT, AST and GGT) 
was observed in paediatrics (21.9% vs 16.1% in adults). The nature and severity of liver-re-
lated AEs in the paediatric subjects were similar to those observed in adults. No case of he-
patic failure was observed. The majority of the cases was mild to moderate and reported out-
come as recovered.
Post-marketing data suggest there may be a higher reporting rate of skin reactions (especially 
erythema) in the paediatric population with respect to adults. Similarly, a higher reporting 
proportion of cases reporting phototoxicity among children with respect to adults (12% vs. 
2.7%)  was observed. There have been more frequently reported post-marketing cases of pan-
creatitis in paediatric patients than in adults.
Elderly
In an oral multiple dose study Cmax and AUCτ in healthy elderly males (≥65 years) were 
61% and 86% higher, respectively, than in healthy younger males (18-45 years). No signifi-
cant differences in Cmax and AUCτ were observed between healthy elderly females (≥ 65 
years) and healthy younger females (18- 45 years).

In the therapeutic studies no dosage adjustment was made on the basis of age. A relationship 
between plasma concentrations and age was observed. 
However, the safety profile of voriconazole in young and elderly subjects was similar and, 
therefore, no dosage adjustment is necessary for the elderly.
Pregnant or Breast-Feeding Women
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity, however the potential risk for humans 
remains unknown.
Patients with Hepatic Impairment
Subjects with some degree of hepatic impairment were treated in the voriconazole clinical 
program. Although there are some pharmacokinetic effects associated with hepatic cirrhosis 
no significant differences in the overall safety profile have been found between subjects with 
and without hepatic impairment. 
After an oral single-dose (200 mg), AUCτ was 233% higher in subjects with mild to moder-
ate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A and B) compared with subjects with normal hepatic func-
tion. Plasma protein binding of voriconazole was not affected by impaired hepatic function. 
In an oral multiple-dose study, AUCτ was similar in subjects with moderate hepatic cirrhosis 
(Child-Pugh B) given a maintenance dose of 100 mg twice daily and subjects with normal 
hepatic function given 200 mg twice daily. No pharmacokinetic data are available for pa-
tients with severe hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh C).
Patients with Renal Impairment
Subjects with some degree of renal impairment were treated in the voriconazole clinical pro-
gram and no significant differences in the overall safety profile have been found between 
subjects with and without renal impairment. 
In an oral single-dose (200 mg) study in subjects with normal renal function and mild (creati-
nine clearance 41-60 ml/min) to severe (creatinine clearance < 20 ml/min) renal impairment, 
the pharmacokinetics of voriconazole were not significantly affected by renal impairment. 
The plasma protein binding of voriconazole was similar in subjects with different degrees of 
renal impairment.
Patients with Other Relevant Co-Morbidity
None were specifically studied in the clinical trial program.
Patients of Different Racial and/or Ethnic Origin
In vivo studies indicated that CYP2C19 plays a key role in the metabolism of voriconazole. 
This enzyme exhibits genetic polymorphism.

For example, 15-20% of Asian populations may be expected to be poor metabolizers. For 
Caucasians and Blacks, the prevalence of poor metabolizers is 3-5%. 
Studies conducted in Caucasian and Japanese healthy subjects have shown that poor metabo-
lizers have, on average, a 4-fold higher voriconazole exposure (AUCτ) than their homozy-
gous extensive metabolizer counterparts. Subjects who are heterozygous extensive metabo-
lizers have on average 2-fold higher voriconazole exposure than their homozygous extensive 
metabolizer counterparts. Nonetheless, no significant differences in the overall safety profile 
have been found among CYP2C19 homozygous extensive metabolizers, heterozygous exten-
sive metabolizers and poor metabolizers.
The major metabolite of voriconazole is the N-oxide, which accounts for 72% of the circulat-
ing radiolabelled metabolites in plasma. This metabolite has minimal antifungal activity and 
does not contribute to the overall efficacy of voriconazole.
Module SV. Post-Authorisation Experience
SV.1. Post-Authorisation Exposure
Cumulatively through 31 May 2023, approximately 36,588 Kg of Pfizer voriconazole has 
been sold worldwide, which equates to an estimated exposure of approximately 250,432 pa-
tient-years and 91,470 patient-days.
SV.1.1. Method Used to Calculate Exposure
Since the treatment duration depends upon patients’ clinical and mycological response it is 
not possible to estimate the number of patients exposed based on a fixed length of treatment; 
the number of patient-years/days is used to estimate exposure. The patient exposure, ex-
pressed as patient-years and patient days, was estimated based on the total amount of Kg of 
Pfizer voriconazole that has been sold worldwide provided by IQVIA from fourth quarter of 
2010 through the fourth quarter of 2022 and extrapolated till 31 May 2023, divided by the 
voriconazole WHO DDD (equal to 0.4 g) for patient days, and further divided by 365.25 for 
patient years.  
36,588 KG / 0.0004 KG / 365.25 = 250,432 patient-years.
36,588 KG / 0.0004 KG = 91,470 patient-days
Module SVI. Additional EU Requirements for the Safety Specification
Potential for misuse for illegal purposes
There is low potential for misuse for illegal purposes with voriconazole. Voriconazole does 
not have characteristics that would make it attractive for use for illegal purposes.

Not applicable.
SVII.1.2. Risks Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns in 
the RMP
Important Identified Risk: Phototoxicity
Risk-benefit impact: Phototoxicity reactions are frequent in patients with immunocompro-
mised status and with exposure to direct sunlight.
Important Identified Risk: Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
Risk-benefit impact: Immunocompromised patients, including patients who have received or-
gan transplant, are at a greater risk of SCC of the skin compared to the immunocompetent 
population.
SVII.2. New Safety Concerns and Reclassification with a Submission of an Updated 
RMP
“Peripheral Neuropathy” “Hepatic toxicity”, “QTc prolongation”, and “Visual events” previ-
ously classified as important identified risk were reclassified as “not important” and removed 
from the list of safety concerns.
“Skin cancer (non-SCC)” and “Suicide-related events” previously classified as important po-
tential risks were reclassified as “not important” and removed from the list of safety con-
cerns.
“Resistance” Effects in pregnancy”, “Effects in paediatrics” and “Off-label use” previously 
classified as missing information were reclassified as not important and therefore removed 
from the list of safety concerns.
The rationales for the changes to the list of safety concerns are presented below. Further de-
tails on the safety concerns will be provided in SVII.3.
Important Identified Risks Removed from the List of Safety Concerns
The risk of ‘peripheral neuropathy’ is not likely to have an impact on the risk-benefit balance 
of the product. Peripheral neuropathy is therefore removed from the RMP as requested by the 
PRAC Rapporteur in the final assessment report (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00003127/201802).
“Hepatic toxicity”, “QTc prolongation”, “Visual events”, “Skin cancer (non-SCC)” and “Sui-
cide-related events” are no longer considered important risks per GVP Mod V (rev 2); ac-
cording to the RSI dated 12 January 2023, routine PV and routine RMM are considered suffi-
cient to identify and/or minimize these risks. Therefore, these important risks are removed 
from the list of the RMP safety concerns.

Missing Information Removed from the List of Safety Concerns
Regarding resistance, currently available data suggest that overall resistance to voriconazole 
among clinical isolates of Aspergillus spp. (among which A. fumigatus predominates) re-
mains below 10%. Based on these evaluations, the MAH commitment to continue monitoring 
resistance in PSURs, acknowledging a potential increase in resistance of environmental 
fungi, was endorsed by the PRAC Rapporteur (Procedure no.: 
EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00003127/202102) and the proposal to remove resistance from the RMP 
as a safety concern, was also accepted.
Effects in pregnancy”, “Effects in paediatrics” and “Off-label use” are removed from the list 
of the safety concerns in line with GVP Module V (Rev. 2) as requested in the RSI dated 12 
January 2023
SVII.3. Details of Important Identified Risks, Important Potential Risks, and Missing 
Information
Important identified risks included in this RMP are: phototoxicity and SCC.
There are no important potential risks for voriconazole.
During the initial clinical development of voriconazole, 52 adolescents were included in the 
adult therapeutic studies. Safety data from the 52 adolescents were originally combined with 
the data for the adults (N=1,603) and the safety data from the pooled population (N=1,655) 
were presented in Module SVII of RMP version 2.0. 
Safety data (N=53) from paediatric studies (A1501080 and A1501085) were pooled with the 
52 paediatrics patients described above (N=105) and presented in Part II.SIV.3.1 
Safety data of paediatric patients from prophylaxis use studies (N=183; Studies 249, 
A1501007, A1501037, A1501081, A1501088, A1501096, A1501073, and A1501038) were 
also pooled and presented in Part II.SIV.3.1. 
Safety data from the 52 adolescent subjects were removed from the data for the 1,655 pa-
tients (N=1,603 adults only subjects). Safety data from 1,603 adults from therapeutic studies

Important Identified Risks
Table 15. Phototoxicity
Potential mechanisms
The major circulating metabolite, voriconazole N-oxide, in humans and preclinical species was shown to ab-
sorb UV light at 310 nm, indicating the potential to be a mediator of phototoxicity if it were to reach sites ex-
posed to sunlight. An in vitro study to evaluate the phototoxicity potential of voriconazole and its N-oxide 
metabolite in Balb/c 3T3 mouse fibroblasts has been completed. 
Neither cytotoxicity nor phototoxicity was observed for either voriconazole or voriconazole N-oxide indicat-
ing a lack of phototoxicity potential when tested to the limits of solubility or the maximum recommended 
concentration of 1000 mg/L.

The overall frequency of phototoxicity in therapeutic and prophylaxis studies is similar: 0.9% vs 1.1%, re-
spectively (see Annex 7, Table 1 and 2).  
Seriousness/outcomes
One subject (0.1%) experienced a SAE suggestive of phototoxicity (Photosensitivity reaction). There were no 
subjects with phototoxicity-related SAEs in the prophylaxis studies (refer to Annex 7, Table 3 and 4).
The most frequently observed AE in pooled adult data was photosensitivity reaction (12), with most subjects 
(8) having recovered at the time of last follow-up. Of the 4 cases of sunburn reported, 2 patients recovered 
and the other 2 had not recovered at the last follow-up. One episode of Actinic keratosis with outcome recov-
ered was also observed. Outcomes of treatment-emergent AEs suggestive of phototoxicity in adult population 
for the therapeutic and prophylaxis studies can be found in Annex 7, Table 5 and 6, respectively.
Severity and nature of risk
The majority of phototoxicity- related AEs (for a total of 15 occurrences) for the combined studies were mild 
(9) to moderate (6) in severity. In addition, there were 2 episodes of Photosensitivity reaction considered se-
vere. Treatment-emergent phototoxicity-related events in the adult population are summarised in Annex 7, 
Table 7 and 8, for the therapeutic and prophylaxis studies, respectively.

Background incidence/prevalence:14  Photosensitivity is an adverse cutaneous reaction that results when a 
certain chemical or drug is applied topically or taken systemically at the same time a person is exposed to 
ultraviolet (UV) or visible light. 
The literature search did not identify papers reporting incidence and/or prevalence of phototoxicity in pa-
tients with fungal infections. Some studies reported frequency of skin reactions in patients using specific 
medications, which are summarised below.
In a retrospective study of 151 patients with acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL), the incidence of 
drug-induced skin reactions was estimated and compared to the general population. About 60% (91/151) of 
14 Relevant papers were identified using the following Boolean search terms: [(papilloedema OR photo-
toxicity) AND SOT OR lung transplant OR heart transplant OR liver transplant OR multiorgan transplant OR 
haematologic malignancy OR HSCT OR HIV OR human immunodeficiency virus OR AIDS OR acquired im-
mune deficiency syndrome OR surgery OR surgical procedure)]

patients developed a drug-related reaction to one or more drugs during remission, induction, and maintenance 
therapy. Overall, the incidence of drug-associated rash was significantly higher than the general population. 
The incidence of drug-associated rashes in patients with ANLL for allopurinol was (16%), co-trimoxazole 
(14%), miconazole (28%), and ketoconazole (18%).74
An analysis using the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database (2004 – 2016) revealed that 0.08% (330 
out of 430,587) of all adverse drug event reports concerned photosensitive reactions.75 However, Drug-in-
duced photosensitivity is likely significantly under-reported due to the difficulty in clinical diagnosis and 
lack of documentation in public databases.76
Risk factors and risk groups
Phototoxicity reactions are frequent in patients with immunocompromised status and with exposure to direct 
sunlight. A higher reporting proportion of phototoxicity reactions in the paediatric population compared to 
that of adult population was observed in the post-marketing experience.
Preventability
It is recommended that all patients, including children, avoid exposure to direct sunlight during voriconazole 
treatment and use measures such as protective clothing and sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF).
If phototoxic reactions occur, multidisciplinary advice should be sought, and the patient should be referred to 
a dermatologist. Voriconazole discontinuation and use of alternative antifungal agents should be considered. 
Dermatologic evaluation should be performed on a systematic and regular basis, whenever voriconazole is 
continued despite the occurrence of phototoxicity-related lesions, to allow early detection and management 
of premalignant lesions. Voriconazole should be discontinued if premalignant skin lesions or squamous cell 
carcinoma are identified.
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product
While generally, drug-induced phototoxicity is not a severe medical condition, patients may experience exag-
gerated sunburn reaction with erythema and oedema that occurs within minutes to hours of sunlight expo-
sure. Vesicles and bullae may develop with severe reactions. 
A less common manifestation of phototoxicity includes pigment changes of the skin. In severe cases, patients 
may exhibit cutaneous lupus erythematosus or pseudoporphyria.77  Sun avoidance and the use of sun protec-
tion are expected to prevent this risk. Discontinuation of voriconazole is expected to relieve the symptoms. 
Therefore, the impact on individual patients is minimal.
Public health impact
Most phototoxic reactions result from the systemic administration of drugs. Although mortality is rare, drug-
induced photosensitivity can cause significant morbidity in some individuals, who must severely limit their 
exposure to natural or artificial light. 
Phototoxicity is expected to be managed via sun avoidance, use of sun protection and discontinuation of 
voriconazole. Because of the extensive education to make prescribers and patients aware of this risk, as well 
as how to prevent and manage it, the potential impact of this risk from voriconazole treatment on public 
health is expected to be minimal.

Incidence of squamous cell carcinoma in patients receiving voriconazole for prophylaxis or treatment
A literature search did not identify published articles describing incidence of SCC of the skin in the overall 
voriconazole treated patient population. Eight studies using retrospective data were identified that reported 
SCC of the skin or NMSC incidence in patients with lung or lung-heart transplant receiving voriconazole for 
prophylaxis or treatment in the US. The incidence of SCC of the skin ranged from 3.1% to 46%.

Characterisation of the risk
SCC (or NMSC) Incidence
3.1% (17/543) developed SCC (all patients were exposed to 
voriconazole in this study).
39.5% (17/43) in the voriconazole group compared to 19.5% 
(15/77) in the non-voriconazole group developed SCC.
26.6% (16/60) developed NMSC in the voriconazole group, 
defined as ≥3 months of voriconazole exposure.
39% (12/31) developed NMSC who were not exposed to 
voriconazole, defined as no or less than 3 months of 
voriconazole use.
At crude level, 19% patients with any claim for voriconazole 
in the database developed NMSC.
At crude level, 12% patients without any claim for voricona-
zole in the database developed NMSC.
Incidence of SCC with any exposure to voriconazole was 
1% at year 1, 25% at year 5 and 43% at year 10 post-lung
transplant.
Cumulative SCC incidence at 1 year was 3%, at 2 years was 
8%, at 3 years was 13%, at 4 years was 14%, and at 5 years 
was 19%.
At 5- and 10-years post-lung transplantation, the cumulative 
incidence of SCC of the skin was 28% and 42% respec-
tively.
At 5 years post-lung transplantation, 46% of patients ever 
exposed to voriconazole developed SCC in the extrapolated 
analysis predicting the incidence estimate.

Seriousness/outcomes 
There were no serious SCC-related AEs in the pooled adult’s data. The outcome of the single case of 
Bowen’s disease was reported as ongoing at the time of last follow-up. Additional details can be found in 
Annex 7, Table 11 and 12 (SAEs), and Table 13 and 14 (Outcomes) for the therapeutic and prophylaxis stud-
ies, respectively.
Severity and nature of risk
There was one treatment-emergent SCC AE (Bowen’s disease) for the pooled adults data, which was catego-
rized as mild in severity. Details can be found in Annex 7, Table 15 for the therapeutic studies. There were 
no SCC AEs in adults from the prophylaxis studies (Table 16).  
Squamous cell carcinomas that are detected at an early stage and removed promptly are almost always cura-
ble and cause minimal damage. However, left untreated, they eventually penetrate the underlying tissues and 
can become disfiguring. A small percentage can metastasize to distant tissues and organs and can become 
fatal.86

Background incidence/prevalence15
The following summarizes the published data on the incidence of SCC of the skin in 1) the general popula-
tion by age group (i.e., paediatric, adult, and elderly), and 2) in patients exposed to voriconazole for prophy-
laxis or treatment by the same age group, when available.
Results from A1501097 PASS are summarized below in the subsection “Epidemiology of SCC in immuno-
compromised patients”.
SCC incidence in the general population
The literature search identified a few studies that described the incidence of SCC of the skin or non-mela-
noma skin cancer (NMSC) in the general population. Using data from the Swedish Cancer Registry, 
Wassberg C et al.,87 reported that the age-standardized SCC incidence (per 100,000 population) in Sweden in 
1995 was 23.1 in men and 10.1 in women. In another population-based study using data from the Cancer 
Registry (2004-2008) in the Netherlands, Hollestein LM et al.88 estimated the age-standardized SCC inci-
dence (per 100,000 persons years) of 32.4 in men and 17.2 in women. In an updated analysis using data from 
the Cancer Registry (1989-2017) in the Netherlands, the estimated age-standardized SCC incidence (per 
100,000 person-years) in male was 40.0 in 1989 and 107.6 in 2017; for female patients, 13.9 in 1989 and 
68.7 in 2017.89
The incidence of SCC of the skin increases with increasing age. Old age has been identified as an important 
risk factor for developing the SCC of the skin. In a comprehensive review article by Alam M et al.,90 the age-
adjusted incidence of SCC (per 100,000 persons per year) among Whites was reported to range from 100 to 
150, and the age-specific incidence among individuals aged >75 years was about 10 times that incidence. 90
In the Swedish study, described above, 87 SCC incidence (per 100,000 population) among males was approxi-
mately 15 in aged <59 years, 75 in aged 60-79 years and 400 in aged ≥80 years between 1991 and 1995. The 
age-specific SCC incidence during the same time period in females was approximately 10 or less in aged <59 
years, 25 in aged 60-79 years and 140 in aged 80 and above16 (Figure 1 a and b).

The literature search did not identify papers describing incidence or prevalence estimates of SCC in patients 
with fungal infections. Alternatively, the MAH summarised the rates in patient populations similar to the tar-
get population. 
It has been well documented that immunocompromised patients, including patients who have received organ 
transplant, have an increased risk of cutaneous SCC compared to the immunocompetent population. Overall, 
the incidence of SCC in transplant recipients is 40 to 250 times that of the general population. 
Epidemiology of SCC in immunocompromised patients: Renal transplant patients receiving long-term im-
munosuppressive therapy are at increased risk of developing skin cancers compared to the general popula-
tion, with SCC being the most common post-transplantation cutaneous malignancy. 
The search identified six studies that reported SCC incidence in renal transplant patients in different geo-
graphical locations, as well as studies in heart transplant, multi-organ transplant, and HIV-infected patients.  
In a retrospective analysis of medical records (1972 to 2004) at the Organ Transplant Center in Kuwait, in-
vestigators reviewed the records of more than 1500 kidney recipients.  A total of seven cases of SCC were 
identified reporting an incidence of 5.97 per 1000 patients.91  
Falsarella, et al conducted a retrospective analysis of medical records (January 1984 to December 2006) of 
post-transplant patients with biopsy-proven skin cancer. Among 1300 renal transplant recipients from Janu-
ary 1984 to December 2006, 33 (2.5%) had skin malignancies during a mean follow up of 42 months (range 
1 to 213 months).92  
Ramsay and colleagues conducted a prospective study and estimated an incidence of NMSC in the renal 
transplant recipients in the UK. A total of 244 (91% enrolled) renal transplant recipients were screened for 
skin cancers between 1998 and 2006. The mean incidence per 1000 patients was 78.2 for NMSC, 34.5 for 
SCC and 35.8 for BCC during a mean follow up of 7.3 years.93  
In a prospective study by Fuente, et al,94 174 patients who received renal transplant were followed from Janu-
ary 1989 to October 1999 at 6-month intervals in the Hospital Universitari Germans Triasi Pujol, Badalona, 
Spain. The median follow-up time was 72 months (range 12 to 140 months). Twenty-two (22) patients devel-
oped SCC during the study period with an incidence of 126.43 per 1,000 patients.95
Using the data from the University Hospital Leiden, The Netherlands, Hartevelt, et al. estimated the overall 
incidence of SCC was 7.6 per 1000 person-year and the incidence of BCC was 3.3 per 1000 person-year.96
Bordea and colleagues carried out a comprehensive analysis of all skin cancer cases occurring in patients re-
ceiving renal transplants in Oxford, UK over a 21-year period. From 1975 to 1996, 1115 patients received 
1360 kidney grafts. Total follow-up time was 7559 patient-year at risk, which individually ranged from 2 to 
23 years. Data on skin cancers were collected by review of the clinical notes and histopathology records. Of

the 980 transplant patients, 187 (19.1%) patients developed at least 1 skin cancer. Overall, the rate of any 
skin cancer was reported to be 141 per 1000 person-year. The rates (per 1000 person-year) of individual tu-
mour types were SCC 71.4, BCC 22.4, and Merkel cell tumour 0.13.97
Heart Transplant patients: Only one study was identified that reported rate of SCC in heart transplant 
recipients. 
Fortina and colleagues enrolled 230 heart transplant recipients aged 18 years or older at the time of transplan-
tation who were followed for at least 3 years in Padua, Italy. The patients were treated with cyclosporine and 
azathioprine (double therapy; n = 37), or with cyclosporine, azathioprine, and oral prednisone (triple therapy; 
n = 193). Among the 230 heart transplant recipients entered into the study, 20.8% (48/230) developed NMSC 
after transplantation: 26 patients had invasive or in situ SCCs, 13 had BCCs, and 9 had both tumours. The 
overall incidence of SCC was 152.17 per 1,000 patients (35/230).98
Liver Transplant patients: Data on the rates of SCC in liver transplant recipients are sparse. The search 
identified only one study that reported the rate of SCC in liver transplant patients. In a survey, 182 liver 
transplant recipients, who received liver transplant at the Division of Transplantation, New England Medical 
Center Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts, United States, between 1991 and 2000 
were inquired about the development of cutaneous malignancies. Of 182 recipients, 15 l responded to survey 
questionnaire. Twenty-three (23) patients reported SCC with a rate (per 1,000 patients) of 126.37 compared 
to 16 patients who developed BCC with an incidence of 87.91. 
The authors concluded that the incidence estimate observed in the survey may be an underestimation of the 
actual incidence of SCC in liver transplant patients because of the limitations of voluntary reporting of skin 
cancers in this study.99
Multi-organ transplant patients: A total of three studies were identified that reported rates of SCC in renal, 
liver, heart, lung or multi-organ transplant patients. Lindelöf, et al used the data from the Swedish Organ 
Transplant cohort, which is composed of 5931 patients who underwent renal transplantation (n = 5139), liver 
(n = 397), or other organ (heart, lung, and pancreas) (n = 395) from January 1, 1970, through December 31, 
1997. A total of 273 patients with SCC were identified from the national Swedish Cancer Registry reporting 
an incidence of 46.0 per 1000 patients.100
In another study, Jensen, et al. linked the records of all patients in Norway who received their first kidney 
(from 1963) or heart transplant (from 1983) through 1992 with the Cancer Registry of Norway and estimated 
the incidence of skin cancers. All transplant recipients were followed up from date of the first transplantation 
to the date of cancer diagnosis, death, emigration, or end of the study, whichever occurred first. 
The overall incidence (per 1000 patient-year) of cutaneous SCC was estimated to be 6.47 (7.23 in males and 
5.19 in females) and lip SCC was 0.66 (0.74 in males and 0.53 in females) in renal or heart transplant pa-
tients.101  
In another retrospective cohort study, a total of 1329 patients who received their first kidney (1062 patients) 
or heart allograft (267 patients) were included from May 1969 to December 1998 at the transplantation units 
of Bergamo, Padua, Rome, and Verona, Italy. The median age at transplantation was 37.5 years for the renal 
transplant recipients and 54 years for the heart transplant recipients, respectively. 
The median follow-up time up was 4 years (range 3 months to 26 years) for the renal transplant patients and 
2.5 years (range 2 months to 10 years) for the heart transplant patients. Overall, the incidence rate of SCC 
was 3.5 per 1000 persons-year (95% CI: 2.2, 4.5).102
HIV infected patients: In a prospective study, Crum-Cianflone estimated the incidence of cutaneous malig-
nancies among HIV-infected persons enrolled in a large HIV study. 
Age-adjusted incidence rate (per 1000-person year) of SCC was reported for the following time periods: 
1991 to 1995 was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.0-18.0), 1996 to 2000 was 0.24 (95% CI: 0.0-5.80), and 2001 to 2006 was 
0.49 (95% CI: 0.0, 10.4).103
PASS A1501097 - Evaluating the risk of SCC of the skin with voriconazole exposure in patients with 
lung/heart-lung transplant: 
The MAH conducted a retrospective observational study to assess the potential association between voricon-
azole use and the development of SCC of the skin in patients with lung or heart/lung transplant (LT).  
A total of 900 patients aged ≥ 18 years undergoing consecutive LT were included from 14 transplant centers 
in EU( 440), North America (430) and Australia (30).  
Overall, the crude incidence rate (per 1,000 person-years) of SCC of the skin was 33.4 in the exposure to 
voriconazole alone category, 10.4 in the exposure to other azoles alone category, 21.7 in the exposure to 
voriconazole and other azole(s) category, and 13.1 in the unexposed category.

In a multivariable Cox regression model analysing voriconazole, other azoles and immunosuppressive agents 
as time-dependent variables, exposure to voriconazole alone (adjusted HR=2.39, 95% CI: 1.31-4.37) and ex-
posure to voriconazole and other azole(s)  (adjusted HR=3.45, 95% CI: 1.07-11.06) were associated with 
SCC of the skin as compared with the unexposed category after controlling for the confounding variables. 
SCC in patients with haematologic malignancy: In a cohort of 24,011 patients who underwent allogeneic 
or syngeneic HSCT reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (n = 18 
488; transplantations from 1964 through 1994, followed up through 1995) or at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Re-
search Center in Seattle (n = 5523; transplantations from 1969 through 1996, followed up through 1997). Us-
ing data from the cohort, the authors estimate the cumulative incidence of SCC was 1.1% (or 11 per 1000 
patients) at 20 years (95% CI: -0.7, 1.7) in analyses adjusting for the competing risk for death.104

In general, skin type, advanced age, sun exposure, genetic predisposition as well as exposure to ionizing radi-
ation, arsenic, or industrial chemicals; pre-existing burns and scars; and immunosuppression 86 are the risk 
factors for SCC of the skin. 
Immunocompromised patients, including patients who have received organ transplant, are at a greater risk of 
SCC of the skin compared to the immunocompetent population. 
The risk of SCC in organ transplant recipients has been associated with the following risk factors in epidemi-
ologic investigations: older age, prolonged occupational sunlight exposure, long duration of immunosuppres-
sive therapy, intense immunosuppressive therapy, significant prior exposure to ultraviolet radiation; infection 
with human papillomavirus, lower CD4 cell counts, and certain hosts factors (eye or hair colour, complexion, 
White race, patients with Fitzpatrick skin types I, II, or III).105 106 107
Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin has been reported with long-term exposure to voriconazole in patients 
with immunosuppressed status.

Preventability
Voriconazole should be discontinued if premalignant skin lesions or SCC are identified
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product
Squamous cell carcinomas that are detected at an early stage and removed promptly are almost always cura-
ble and cause minimal damage. 
However, left untreated, they eventually penetrate the underlying tissues and can become disfiguring. A 
small percentage can metastasize to distant tissues and organs and can become fatal. 86
Public health impact
In general, despite increased knowledge and public education regarding the causes of skin cancer and modes 
of prevention, the incidence of SCC continues to rise worldwide.108  The speculated causes for the rise in-
clude an aging population, improved detection, and environmental factors, such as depletion of the ozone 
layer. 
Although cutaneous SCC is not often fatal, it can cause significant morbidity. Most SCCs are located in the 
head and neck region, where surgery for advanced-stage disease can be disfiguring. Furthermore, the cost of 
treatment has been shown to pose a significant public health burden. In a study of the US Medicare popula-
tion, the treatment of NMSCs ranked fifth among the most expensive cancers to treat because, although 
NMSC has a low mortality, its incidence is more common than all other cancers combined.109  Although the 
potential impact of SCC on public health is expected to be high in general, the potential impact of SCC from 
voriconazole use on public health is expected to be minimal.

Removal of additional risk minimisation activities
To ensure that the risks of phototoxicity, hepatic toxicity and SCC of the skin are adequate-ly 
managed, further risk minimisation activities were performed beginning in April 2014. These 
activities included aRMMs which had the following components: HCP Checklist, HCP Ques-
tion & Answer Brochure, and Patient Alert Card. However, no clear conclusion could be 
drawn on the effectiveness of these aRMMs. 
Available data from PASS A1501102 which evaluated the effectiveness of additional RMMs 
aimed at reducing the risks of phototoxicity, SCC of the skin and hepatic toxicity in patients 
receiving voriconazole suggested that the source for HCPs knowledge about the risks with 
voriconazole is not clearly linked to the aRMM. Further, study A1501103, a non-interven-
tional, retrospective PASS designed to monitor selected safety risks in patients re-ceiving 
voriconazole in the real-world setting, particularly with long-term use (i.e., ≥180 days), did 
not show increased risk of hepatic disorders, phototoxicity, SCC of the skin, vis-ual disorders 
and periostitis with voriconazole use or other information that would necessi-tate continued 
implementation of the educational materials.
PFIZER 
Page 72

Risk Management Plan
June 2023
Moreover, after an extensive literature review of relevant publications, guidelines and other 
resources, there is evidence that the most important recommendations included in both the 
routine and additional RMMs for voriconazole in relation to hepatic toxicity, SCC and pho-
totoxicity have been integrated into routine clinical practice, in particular in the European re-
gion. 
Since the SmPC remains the most important routine RMM, it currently clearly communi-
cates all relevant pieces of safety information to prescribers and therefore HCP-focused 
aRMMs are not expected to provide further significant awareness to the prescribers regard-
ing these well-known risks.
The MAH therefore proposed to remove the HCP educational materials from the RMP and 
keep the Patient Alert Card as proposed by EMA in the RSI received in September 2022 
(Procedure No. EMEA/H/C/WS2270). This proposal was accepted by EMA in the Updated 
Assessment Report dated 05 January 2023 as part of the same procedure.

Vfend's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential in-
formation to healthcare professionals and patients on how Vfend should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Vfend should be read in the context of all this information in-
cluding the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Vfend's 
RMP.
I. The Medicine and What It Is Used For
Vfend is authorised for:
 Treatment of invasive aspergillosis.
 Treatment of candidaemia in non-neutropenic patients.
 Treatment of fluconazole-resistant serious invasive Candida infections (including C. 
krusei).
 Treatment of serious fungal infections caused by Scedosporium spp. and Fusarium spp.
Voriconazole should be administered primarily to patients with progressive, possibly life-
threatening infections.
 Prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections in high-risk allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell 
transplant (HSCT) recipients.
It contains voriconazole as the active substance and it is given by intravenous and oral route 
of administration.
Further information about the evaluation of Vfend’s benefits can be found in Vfend’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medi-
cine’s https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/hu-

II. Risks Associated With the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further Charac-
terise the Risks
Important risks of Vfend, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Vfend's risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
 Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals
PFIZER 
Page 74
Vfend (voriconazole)
Risk Management Plan

Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
June 2023
 The authorised pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly;
 The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of Vfend, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below.
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Vfend is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A List of Important Risks and Missing Information
Important risks of Vfend are risks that need special risk management activities to further in-
vestigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there 
is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Vfend. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this associa-
tion has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to 
information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

ANNEX 6. DETAILS OF PROPOSED ADDITIONAL RISK MINIMISATION 
ACTIVITIES (IF APPLICABLE)
The following risk minimisation tools were distributed:
Health Care Professional Checklist for phototoxicity, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
•
and hepatotoxicity.
Health Care Professional Question and Answer Brochure for phototoxicity, SCC and
•
hepatotoxicity.
•
Patient Alert Card for phototoxicity and SCC.
Specifications for the Additional Risk Minimisation Tools
The three components of the RM tools are the HCP/Prescriber Checklist, HCP Question & 
Answer (Q&A) Brochure and Patient Alert Card.  
The content and layout of the RM tools were non promotional in nature.  User testing of the 
RM tools was conducted in October 2013 with a sample of HCPs in the UK and France prior 
to the finalization of RM tools and subsequent distribution in April 2014.  Specifically, 
prototypes of each tool (i.e., HCP Checklist, HCP Q&A Brochure, and Patient Alert Card) 
were reviewed in a one on one, moderator guided interview for clarity and comprehension of 
the content and purpose of each piece.  Findings from this user testing allowed for the 
improvement of the tools’ content and format to enhance comprehension of the product’s 
risks and how to manage them.

To remind HCPs about monitoring liver function (particularly useful for the out-patient 
setting, since hospitalised patients are already closely monitored) and dermatological 
evaluation on a systematic and regular basis whenever Vfend is continued despite the 
occurrence of phototoxicity-related lesions, as described in the SmPC.
To remind HCPs about appropriate usage of voriconazole and management of patients with 
underlying hepatic impairment and those developing hepatic injury.
To encourage HCPs to discuss/educate the patient/care giver regarding the risks of 
phototoxicity, hepatotoxicity and SCC, as well as the need for monitoring liver function and 
dermatological consultation at regular intervals as described in the SmPC.
To remind HCPs to provide a Patient Alert Card to the patient.

Implementation of the Additional Risk Minimisation Activities
These additional risk minimisation activities were designed to take into account the different 
clinical practice settings (inpatient and outpatient). The distribution of the materials started in
April 2014 across 33 countries* (Albania, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, 
Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, 
Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Montenegro, Netherlands, Norway,

Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and UK.)  Once local 
Health Authority approval was obtained, the RM tools were mailed to the country within 4 
weeks.  Additionally, in some of the countries, depending on local rules and regulations, the 
RM tools were posted to various webpages, including local Pfizer country offices and local 
National Health Authorities.
Table 1 below presents aRMM tools distribution metrics including the date when the aRMM 
tools where distributed to the local Health Authority for approval, when the aRMM tools 
were mailed, number of HCPs who were mailed the tools and the number and proportion of 
returned envelopes as well as the date when the evaluation survey started in the 10 countries 
where the evaluation survey was conducted: UK, France, Austria, Ireland, Denmark, 
Germany, Spain, Italy, Netherlands and Hungary.

a minimum of 60 days.  
Core Development of the HCP Checklist and the Other Risk Minimisation Tools
The risk minimisation tools were designed to be primarily available to HCPs via a paper-
based distribution system. In addition several Health Authorities (EMA, MHRA, and ANSM) 
have included PDF copies of the materials on their websites for download.
The risk minimisation tools were designed to be useful and easy to use, to encourage high 
uptake of the voluntary tools.  The HCP Checklist served as a core tool functioning as an 
educational tool and a reminder of the screening and prescribing process for prescribers.

Finalisation and Local Adaptation of the Tools and Other Materials
The voriconazole risk minimisation tool prototypes were submitted to local Heath 
Authorities for review and tailored for any local rules and regulations. The tools have been 
available in the local languages of the countries in which they have been distributed.
Removal of additional risk minimisation activities
To ensure that the risks of phototoxicity, hepatic toxicity and SCC of the skin are adequately 
managed, further risk minimisation activities were performed beginning in April 2014. These 
activities included aRMMs which had the following components: HCP Checklist, HCP 
Question & Answer Brochure, and Patient Alert Card. However, no clear conclusion could 
be drawn on the effectiveness of these aRMMs. 
Available data from PASS A1501102 which evaluated the effectiveness of additional risk 
minimisation measure aimed at reducing the risks of phototoxicity, SCC of the skin and he-
patic toxicity in patients receiving voriconazole suggested that the source for HCPs 
knowledge about the risks with voriconazole is not clearly linked to the aRMM. Furthermore, 
study A1501103, a non-interventional, retrospective PASS designed to monitor selected 
safety risks in patients receiving voriconazole in the real-world setting, particularly with 
long-term use (i.e. ≥180 days), did not show increased risk of hepatic disorders, 
phototoxicity, SCC of the skin, visual disorders and periostitis with voriconazole use or other 
information that would necessitate continued implementation of the educational materials.
Moreover, after an extensive literature review of relevant publications, guidelines and other 
resources, there is evidence that the most important recommendations included in both the 
routine and additional RMMs for voriconazole in relation to hepatic toxicity, SCC and 
phototoxicity have been integrated into routine clinical practice, in particular in the European 
region. Since the SmPC remains the most important routine RMM, it currently clearly 
communicates all relevant pieces of safety information to prescribers and therefore HCP-
focused aRMMs are not expected to provide further significant awareness to the prescribers 
regarding these well-known risks.
The MAH therefore proposed to remove the HCP educational materials from the RMP and 
keep the Patient Alert Card as proposed by EMA in the RSI received in September 2022 
(Procedure No. EMEA/H/C/WS2270). This proposal was accepted by EMA in the Updated 
Assessment Report dated 05 January 2023 as part of the same procedure.

Current Additional Risk Minimisation Measures 
Patient Alert Card for Phototoxicity and SCC
Reminds patients of the risk of phototoxicity and skin SCC during voriconazole 
-
treatment.
Reminds patients when and how to report relevant signs and symptoms of 
-
phototoxicity and skin cancer.
Reminds patients to take steps to minimize the risk of skin reactions and skin SCC 
-
(by avoiding exposure to direct sunlight, use of a sunscreen and protective clothing) during 
voriconazole treatment and inform HCPs if they experience relevant skin abnormalities.

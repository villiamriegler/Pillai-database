procedure) 
2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product designation in 2018 was 
based on the following grounds:  
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing synthetic double-
stranded siRNA oligonucleotide targeted against transthyretin mRNA, with six phosphorothioate 
linkages in the backbone, and nine 2'-fluoro and thirty-five 2'-O-methyl nucleoside residues in 
the sequence, which is covalently linked via a phosphodiester group to a ligand containing three 
N-acetylgalactosamine residues was considered justified based on non-clinical in vivo data 
showing a reduction in levels of circulating transthyretin after administration of the proposed 
product; 
• 
• 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to the development of 
polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting less than 0.2 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made. 
The COMP recommends the designation of this medicinal product, containing synthetic double-stranded 
siRNA oligonucleotide targeted against transthyretin mRNA, with six phosphorothioate linkages in the 
backbone, and nine 2'-fluoro and thirty-five 2'-O-methyl nucleoside residues in the sequence, which is 
covalently linked via a phosphodiester group to a ligand containing three N-acetylgalactosamine 
residues as an orphan medicinal product for the orphan indication: treatment of transthyretin-
mediated amyloidosis. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting 
not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the application is made 
Condition 
Amyloidosis is the general term used to refer to the extracellular tissue deposition of fibrils composed 
of low molecular weight subunits of a variety of proteins, many of which circulate as constituents of 
plasma. These depositions disrupt the structure and thus the function of the affected tissues leading to 
EMA/OD/0000085855 
Page 4/16 
 
 
 
 
a wide range of clinical manifestations. Transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (ATTR amyloidosis) is 
characterized by the progressive accumulation of insoluble misfolded transthryetin (TTR) protein 
deposits (amyloid) in the extracellular matrix of tissues causing progressive dysfunction. It is a rare, 
systemic disease occurring in adults, resulting from either hereditary (genetic mutation) or acquired 
(ageing) causes. The hereditary form is referred to as hereditary ATTR (hATTR) amyloidosis and the 
acquired form is referred to as wild-type ATTR (wtATTR) amyloidosis. hATTR amyloidosis is an 
autosomal dominant disorder caused by over 120 point-mutations in the TTR gene that leads to the 
extracellular deposition of amyloid fibrils containing both mutant and wild-type (wt) TTR. The site of 
amyloid deposition and the particular TTR mutation determine the clinical manifestations of the 
disease, resulting in a spectrum of disease manifestations consisting of polyneuropathy (hATTR 
amyloidosis with polyneuropathy also known as familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy or FAP) and 
cardiomyopathy (hATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy also known as familial amyloidotic 
cardiomyopathy or FAC) phenotypes. While patients with hATTR amyloidosis may present with 
predominantly polyneuropathy or cardiomyopathy, most patients with hATTR amyloidosis manifest 
signs and symptoms of both polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy over the course of their disease. 
Normal, non-mutant wild type TTR (wt TTR) alone is also amyloidogenic; this is the basis for the 
acquired, wtATTR amyloidosis, previously known as senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA). In this variant 
there are no mutations in the TTR gene and clinically it presents typically as cardiomyopathy in a 
slowly progressive pattern in the elderly.  
Transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis diagnosis can be challenging and is based on the establishment of 
signs and symptoms of polyneuropathy and/or cardiomyopathy consistent with the known clinical 
manifestations of the disease, in conjunction with biopsy results, confirmation of a mutant TTR 
genotype and absence of other known causes of peripheral neuropathy or cardiomyopathy 
The intended therapeutic indication “Amvuttra is indicated for the treatment of hereditary 
transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR amyloidosis) in adult patients with stage 1 or stage 2 
polyneuropathy.” falls within the scope of the designated orphan condition “Treatment of transthyretin-
mediated amyloidosis”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP, see 
EPAR. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
ATTR amyloidosis is a progressive, serious and life-threatening, multisytemic disease that leads to 
motor, sensory and autonomic neuropathy as well as cardiomyopathy. Following the onset of 
symptoms, quality of life is severely impacted and the disease proceeds inexorably to death, with life 
expectancy for hATTR amyloidosis limited to 4.7 years following diagnosis. Median survival after 
diagnosis of hATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy is approximately 2.5 years for patients affected 
by the V122I mutation and 3.5 years for those affected by T60A. Median survival after diagnosis of 
wtATTR amyloidosis has been reported to be approximately 3.5 to 4 years.  
It can therefore be acknowledged that ATTR amyloidosis is a chronically debilitating and life-
threatening condition. 
EMA/OD/0000085855 
Page 5/16 
 
 
 
 
The COMP concluded that the condition remains chronically debilitating and life-threatening due to the 
development of polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
At the time of designation, the prevalence (P) was agreed to be less than 0.2 per 10,000.  
For this review the prevalence was presented to the COMP to remain less than 5 per 10,000 and was 
estimated to be 1.84 per 10,000.  
The relatively large difference in prevalence estimate is mainly driven by the higher figure proposed for 
the wtATTR population. This figure was 0.032 at the time of designation but is now proposed to be 1.7 
in 10,000. 
For the calculation of the prevalence the sponsor has added the calculated prevalence values of hATTR 
amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, hATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy and wild type ATTR 
(wtATTR) amyloidosis. 
The Sponsor presented a summary of estimated hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy prevalence in 
the community for 2021/experts’ opinion. As neither incidence nor prevalence of hATTR amyloidosis 
with polyneuropathy have been reported for some countries of the European Community, the sponsor 
chose the prevalence in France to provide a reasonable extrapolation in agreement with the 
extrapolation method used by Schmidt et al., 2018, in an analysis of the global epidemiology of hATTR 
with polyneuropathy. 
The results from the sponsor’s estimation of prevalence estimated for hATTR amyloidosis with 
cardiomyopathy is displayed in Table 2. For the “other countries’’ for which no data was available on 
public domain, the same approach that was explained above was followed.

Based on the above data the estimated prevalence of transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis is 1.84 per 
10,000 persons. 
The COMP agreed that a prevalence of 1.8 is quite conservative and accepted the proposal, taking into 
account the potential sources of uncertainty in the estimation.

Treatment of transthyretin amyloidosis in adult patients with 
stage 1 symptomatic polyneuropathy to delay peripheral 
neurologic impairment 
Therefore, for the significant benefit Onpattro (patisiran) and Tegsedi (inotersen) should be considered 
as satisfactory methods.  
The sponsor considered also Vyndaqel (tafamidis) as satisfactory method.   
However, tafamidis is for the treatment of transthyretin amyloidosis in adult patients with stage 1 
symptomatic polyneuropathy to delay peripheral neurologic impairment therefore, vutrisiran covers a 
broader patient population including patients with stage 2 polyneuropathy in adult patients with 
hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR), which is not covered by tafamidis.   
Significant benefit 
Protocol Assistance (EMEA/H/SA/3876/1/2018/PA/III, 26 Sep 2018) was sought regarding the planned 
Phase 3 study design where demonstration of significant benefit of vutrisiran for the maintenance of 
orphan designation at the time of MAA filing was discussed with the COMP.  Significant benefit of 
vutrisiran was proposed to be demonstrated over patisiran, inotersen and tafamidis, the three 
treatments which were expected to have been approved in the EU at the time of the vutrisiran MAA 
filing:  
• 
for the demonstration of significant benefit over patisiran, it was proposed to show major 
contribution to patient care due to a more convenient quarterly SC dosing of vutrisiran compared 
to patisiran.  The COMP advised that this should be demonstrated by adequate quality of life or 
patient centered outcomes that show a meaningful reduction in treatment burden. It was also 
EMA/OD/0000085855 
Page 8/16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
stated that potentially a more favourable safety profile could also support the demonstration of 
significant benefit;  
•  regarding the other authorised products inotersen and tafamidis, the COMP recommended that 
significant benefit be demonstrated with direct or methodologically adequate indirect 
comparisons showing improved efficacy, improved safety or a major contribution to patient care. 
In conclusion, the COMP agreed that the proposed clinical development of vutrisiran could be sufficient 
to demonstrate significant benefit when taking into consideration above recommendations on evidence 
generation. 
However, as it was mentioned above, regarding the comparison to tafamidis, since vutrisiran covers a 
broader patient population including patients with stage 2 polyneuropathy in adult patients with 
hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR), which is not covered by tafamidis, there was need for 
the sponsor to provide data on this comparison. 
The efficacy of Amvuttra was studied in a randomised, open-label clinical study (HELIOS-A) in adult 
patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. Patients were randomised 3:1 to receive 25 mg 
of Amvuttra (N=122) subcutaneously once every 3 months, or 0.3 mg/kg patisiran (N=42) 
intravenously once every 3 weeks. The treatment period of the study was conducted over 18 months 
with two analyses at Month 9 and at Month 18. Ninety-seven percent (97%) of Amvuttra-treated 
patients completed at least 18 months of the assigned treatments (vutrisiran or patisiran). Efficacy 
assessments were based on a comparison of the vutrisiran arm of the study with an external placebo 
group (placebo arm of the APOLLO Phase 3 study) comprised of a similar population of patients with 
hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. Assessment of non-inferiority of serum TTR reduction was 
based on comparison of the vutrisiran arm to the within-study patisiran arm. The primary efficacy 
endpoint was the change from baseline to Month 18 in modified Neuropathy Impairment Score +7 
(mNIS+7). The change from baseline to Month 18 in Norfolk Quality of Life-Diabetic Neuropathy (QoL-
DN) total score was assessed as a secondary endpoint. Other secondary endpoints included gait speed 
(10-meter walk test), nutritional status (mBMI), and patient-reported ability to perform activities of 
daily living and social participation (Rasch-Built Overall Disability Scale [R-ODS]). 
Treatment with Amvuttra in the HELIOS-A study demonstrated statistically significant improvements in 
all endpoints measured from baseline to Month 9 and 18, compared to the external placebo group of 
the APOLLO study (all p < 0.0001). 
•  Significant benefit of vutrisiran over inotersen  
The sponsor claims demonstration of significant benefit of vutrisiran over inotersen based on the 
criterion of improved safety and major contribution to patient care. 
The safety profile of inotersen is characterized by the risks of thrombocytopenia, glomerulonephritis 
and renal function decline, which are listed as warnings in the Summary of Product Characteristics 
(SmPC) [Akcea Therapeutics; Benson 2017].   Inotersen is associated with reductions in platelet count, 
which may result in thrombocytopenia (a very common ADR per Tegsedi SmPC).  In the Phase 3, 
NEURO-TTR trial, platelet count reductions to below normal (140 x 109/L) were observed in 54% of 
patients treated with inotersen and 13% of placebo patients; reductions to below 100x109/L were 
observed in 23% of patients treated with inotersen and 2% of the patients receiving placebo; 
confirmed platelet counts of <75x109/L were observed in 10.7% of inotersen-treated patients. Three 
(3%) patients developed platelet counts <25x109/L; one of these patients experienced a fatal 
intracranial haemorrhage (Tegsedi SmPC). Therefore, there is a requirement for monitoring of platelet 
EMA/OD/0000085855 
Page 9/16 
 
 
 
 
counts every 2 weeks during treatment with inotersen and for 8 weeks following discontinuation of 
treatment.  Recommendations for dosing adjustments are provided in the posology section of the 
inotersen SmPC in case of reduction in platelet count. In addition, inotersen is contraindicated in 
patients with a platelet count less than 100x109/L.  
Renal function monitoring recommendations are also provided in the SmPC since glomerulonephritis 
has occurred in patients treated with inotersen.  This includes monitoring of urine protein to creatinine 
ratio (UPCR) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) every 3 months or more frequently, as 
clinically indicated, based on history of chronic kidney disease and/or renal amyloidosis.  UPCR and 
eGFR should also be monitored for 8 weeks following discontinuation of treatment. Inotersen is 
contraindicated in patients with UPCR ≥113 mg/mmol (1 g/g) prior to treatment and 
eGFR<45 ml/min/1.73m2. 
In contrast, the SmPC for vutrisiran does not have these contraindications, thus broadening the patient 
population addressable by vutrisiran compared to inotersen. Vutrisiran SmPC also does not require 
monitoring since there were no effects seen on platelet counts or any evidence of renal toxicity in the 
HELIOS-A study, which included 4 patients with eGFR 30-45 mL/min/1.73m2 at baseline.   
The difference in safety and tolerability profile between inotersen and vutrisiran was also reflected in 
the discontinuation rate from the pivotal studies. In Study NEURO-TTR, inotersen had a higher 
treatment discontinuation rate (22% of patients) compared to placebo (13%), with the main reasons 
being adverse events (AEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs) (14.2% vs. 1.7%). In the inotersen 
group, over one-third of the AEs that led to permanent discontinuation of study treatment were 
associated with thrombocytopenia (4) or glomerulonephritis (2), which are known to be associated 
with inotersen treatment [Tegsedi EPAR EMA/411876/2018].  Contrary to this observation, in the 18-
month treatment period of HELIOS-A, vutrisiran had a lower treatment discontinuation (4.1%) 
compared to the external placebo (APOLLO, 37.7%).  Of the 5 (4.1%) vutrisiran treatment 
discontinuations, 1 was due to an unrelated AE, 2 due to death of the patient unrelated to study 
treatment (COVID-19 pneumonia and iliac artery occlusion), 1 due to physician decision for a patient 
who did not comply with study visits and was considered lost to follow up, and 1 due to withdrawal of 
consent to treatment by the patient. 
Regarding the major contribution to patient care the sponsor argued that vutrisiran treatment does not 
require frequent laboratory monitoring as does inotersen, which constitutes a significant reduction in 
the burden of patient care compared to inotersen.  It is estimated that the laboratory monitoring of 
inotersen contributes to approximately 26 blood draws per patient per year.  Additionally, vutrisiran 
administration every three months is less frequent than the weekly injection of inotersen, which 
substantially decreases the number of healthcare encounters (from 52 to 4 dosing visits) and the 
amount of time associated with the weekly visit to a healthcare setting.  This is consistent with global 
trends toward decreased healthcare encounters, the importance of which has recently been highlighted 
by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Following the COMP’s request, the sponsor submitted an indirect treatment comparison (ITC) for 
efficacy between vutrisiran and inotersen.  This ITC was performed using standard, well-accepted 
methods for estimating the relative efficacy of two treatments that have not been studied in a head-to-
head trial, including Bucher and matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) methods.  According to 
the sponsor the results showed more favorable efficacy outcomes with vutrisiran as compared with 
inotersen in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (see Table 5).

[1] For mNIS+7Ionis and Norfolk-QoL-DN, mean differences< 0 favor vutrisiran and mean differences > 0 favor 
inotersen. For BMI, mean differences > 0 favor vutrisiran. 
[2] Missing data for change from baseline on mNIS+7Ionis, Norfolk-QoL-DN, and BMI were imputed using jump-to-
reference approach. 
[3] In the Bucher analysis, the treatment effect for vutrisiran was adjusted using propensity scores estimated from 
the HELIOS-A study to account for the differences in characteristics between the vutrisiran group and the external 
placebo group from APOLLO. 
In addition, the sponsor claimed that vutrisiran covers a broader patient population (i.e., patients with 
eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73m2) that can be treated with vutrisiran compared to inotersen. Four patients 
with baseline eGFR 30-45 mL/min/1.73m2, which would constitute a labeled contraindication to 
inotersen, were treated on the vutrisiran arm of HELIOS-A. At month 18, 2 of the 4 patients 
demonstrated substantial improvement from baseline in mNIS+7 (change form baseline of -10.1 and -
17.5 points for the two patients respectively).  Among these 4 patients, there were no treatment 
related AEs and no AEs leading to treatment discontinuation.  All 4 patients completed the 18-month 
treatment period and are continuing treatment in the randomized treatment extension.   
Finally, the sponsor claimed that patients treated with vutrisiran are observed to have more favorable 
outcomes in terms of polyneuropathy-related quality of life as measured by Norfolk-QOL-DN.  In 
addition, data from the comparison of vutrisiran with patisiran within HELIOS-A are directionally 
consistent with the hypothesis that vutrisiran (administered once every 3 months) should yield benefits 
in terms of general health-related quality of life over treatments with a more frequent administration 
schedule (such as inotersen which is administered weekly).    
The COMP considered that regarding the claim on improved efficacy and based on the ITC results there 
is a quite large difference in baseline measurements for the mNIS+7 endpoint. This is probably 
because the treatments vutrisiran and inotersen are actually from different trials and not a randomised 
comparison. But mNIS+7 mean values of approximately 60 and 75 constitute a fairly large difference, 
whereas for the NEURO-TTR trial it looks much more balanced for mNIS+7 with approximately 75 and 
79. In Table 5, indirect treatment effects of -9.2 (Bucher) and -4.6 (MAIC) for mNIS+7 are reported. 
This reassures that the treatment effect is not overestimated however, the difference between the two 
methods is not that small. In addition, no details are provided on the models that have been used. 
Mixed models and propensity scores are vaguely mentioned, but the sponsor didn’t provide any details. 
Finally, no sensitivity analyses or details on missing data are provided.

In summary, the COMP considered that based on the missing information (e.g. detailed description of 
the models, missing data, baseline comparisons, etc.) the claim on significant benefit based on the 
improved efficacy is not acceptable.   
Regarding the claim on the broader population, the COMP concluded the clinical data in 4 patients with 
baseline eGFR 30-45 mL/min/1.73m2, showed that vutrisiran is efficacious in a subset of patients with 
moderate-severe renal impairment for whom inotersen is contraindicated. Therefore, the significant 
benefit of vutrisiran versus inotersen is acceptable. 
•  Significant benefit of vutrisiran over patisiran  
Based on the results from HELIOS-A, vutrisiran demonstrated non-inferiority compared to within-study 
patisiran as the 95% CI of the median treatment difference in TTR percent reduction (vutrisiran – 
patisiran) was 1.17, 9.25, in which its lower limit was above -10%. Since HELIOS-A was not designed 
to show superiority, the sponsor claimed demonstration of significant benefit of vutrisiran over 
patisiran based on major contribution to patient care by utilizing a new, infrequent method of 
administration (subcutaneous [SC] injection every 3 months), which is considered a clinically 
significant enhancement in delivery of patient care by the sponsor.   
The vutrisiran dosing yields better treatment compliance and decreased burden of care while not 
compromising efficacy or safety as demonstrated by the results from the 18-month treatment period of 
the HELIOS-A study.  More specifically, the reduction in serum TTR levels with vutrisiran (84.7%) was 
determined to be non-inferior to the within-study patisiran arm (80.6%) based on the prespecified 
criteria.  Accordingly, consistent treatment effects were observed in the vutrisiran and patisiran groups 
of HELIOS-A at Month 18 time point.  Collectively, these results support the clinical interpretation of 
comparable efficacy of vutrisiran and patisiran.   
The key features of vutrisiran and patisiran that are considered relevant to demonstrate major 
contribution to patient care are provided in Table 6.

Patisiran is administered by IV infusion every 3 weeks. Each patisiran infusion must be preceded (at 
least 60 minutes prior to the start of infusion) by a premedication regimen of corticosteroids, 
antihistamines (H1 and H2 blockers) and paracetamol. The infusion takes approximately 80 minutes, 
which may even be extended in the event of infusion-related reactions (patisiran SmPC), a recognized 
complication from intravenous infusions listed as an important identified risk in the patisiran Risk 
Management Plan.  Infusion-related reactions have been reported and continue to be reported in 
clinical studies of patisiran. While the majority of patients have placement of a peripheral IV catheter 
for each patisiran infusion and the infusions occur without events, as with any intravenously 
administered therapy, patients may have complications at the site of the peripheral IV catheter, such 
as extravasation or phlebitis.  In a few instances, reports have been made of indwelling catheters 
being placed for delivery of regular patisiran infusions.  In one case in a clinical trial of patisiran (ALN-
TTR02-006), a patient had a serious adverse event (SAE) of vascular device infection necessitating 
removal of the catheter and discontinuation from further dosing with patisiran due to poor peripheral 
venous access.  These data illustrate some of the clinically significant challenges in administering an IV 
product for a life-long therapy for a serious medical condition.  
In contrast, vutrisiran is administered by SC injection once every three months and as with any SC 
injection, the administration is quick and typically takes only a few seconds.  No premedications, such 
as the ones required prior to patisiran infusion (including corticosteroids), are required.  Mild, transient 
injection site reactions have been reported with vutrisiran in 5 patients (4.1%), corresponding to 0.6% 
of the 836 total doses administered during the 18 Month Treatment Period of the HELIOS-A study. 
Vutrisiran SC administration obviates the risk of complications from intravenous infusions (e.g., IRRs, 
extravasation) and the potential need for indwelling catheters and the associated risks.  
In addition to the advantages of the SC dosing of vutrisiran compared with IV infusion, the infrequent 
dosing of vutrisiran every 3 months substantially decreases the number of healthcare encounters (from 
18 to 4 dosing visits per year). Given that the travel time associated with a visit every three weeks to 
a specialized infusion center for patisiran administration as well as time required for administering the 
premedications can be significant, a substantial number of person-hours per year are estimated to be 
lost on IV infusion care, including travel time and time required for premedication. While home infusion 
of patisiran by a healthcare professional (HCP) is allowed per the SmPC, in practice it is not permitted 
or not available in many EU countries.  As of the date of this report, the sponsor estimated that only 
30% of the patients currently receiving commercial patisiran in the EU have access to home care and 
these patients reside in only 9 of the 27 Member States.  In contrast, vutrisiran can be administered in 
a variety of hospital and outpatient settings, which enables patients to travel to the closest and most 
convenient clinic to get their SC injection.  
Importantly, vutrisiran, with its infrequent SC administration, is expected to yield improved treatment 
compliance and resiliency to disruptions in dosing. This has been demonstrated by the results from the 
HELIOS-A study, where only 1 (0.8%) vutrisiran-treated patient missed a dose of study drug, despite 
the considerable disruption caused by the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic.  In comparison, 22 
(52.4%) patisiran-treated patients missed 1 or more doses. 
As a real-world example of the overall burden of care posed by patisiran treatment outlined above, the 
sponsor argued that at least 2 patients in the EU discontinued treatment with patisiran. One of them, 
EMA/OD/0000085855 
Page 13/16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
after approximately 3 years of continuous therapy, despite benefiting from patisiran and showing 
disease stabilisation, started to experience difficulties with the IV infusion especially related to lack of 
venous access due to prolonged infusions with patisiran, which led to the implantation of an 
intravenous chamber device. Soon after, due to concerns about the risk of chamber-related infections 
and about continued IV treatment requiring premedications and associated fatigue, the patient refused 
to receive further doses of patisiran.  The sponsor is also aware that at least 5 additional patients have 
expressed substantial concerns with regard to treatment fatigue related to patisiran infusions, 
drowsiness due to the premedication, and that the frequency of administration interferes with their 
professional and personal lives. While some of these patients receive home infusions, others have to 
travel long distances to their local hospital to receive patisiran infusion. 
When considering all of the aspects associated with receiving an IV dose every 3 weeks, such as travel 
time and additional care for both the patient and their caregivers, and including the need for 
premeditations and a peripheral IV catheter placement, the difference in the delivery of care to 
patients is substantial and strongly favors vutrisiran.   
The COMP considered the above arguments, however, no patient reported outcomes or patient 
preference data have been provided to support the claim for major contribution to patient care. The 
sponsor was requested to provide a data driven analysis preferably based on patient reported outcome 
including quality of life data in order to support the significant benefit of vutrisiran over patisiran. 
Based on the above request, the sponsor provided an analysis of data from a ‘Patient Experience 
Survey’ administered to patients with hATTR amyloidosis at baseline, at Month 9 and Month 18 of the 
HELIOS-A treatment period. This analysis comprises 2 questions, to assess the impact of (1) frequency 
of dosing and (2) the duration of each individual dose administration on patients’ perceived experience 
receiving treatment with vutrisiran or patisiran. The results showed that larger percentages of patients 
rated the dosing schedule as being “quite convenient” or “extremely convenient” in the vutrisiran arm 
(71.4% - 86.1%, depending on the assessment time point) than in the patisiran arm (41.7% - 
53.8%). In addition, larger percentages of patients rated the duration of dosing as being “quite a bit 
convenient” or “extremely convenient” in the vutrisiran arm (68.7% - 83.2%, depending on the 
assessment time point) than in the patisiran arm (35.9% - 50.0%). Further in line with these findings 
suggesting strong favorability for vutrisiran, patients in the vutrisiran arm reported markedly 
unfavorable ratings of treatment convenience less commonly than did patients in the patisiran arm. No 
more than 3.0% of patients at any time point in the vutrisiran arm, but up to 12.5% of those in the 
patisiran arm, rated the dosing schedule as being “not at all convenient”. Similarly, no more than 3.0% 
of patients at any time point in the vutrisiran arm, but up to 8.3% of those in the patisiran arm, rated 
the treatment administration time as being “not at all convenient”. 
The sponsor also provided analysis of data from a ‘Patient Preference Survey’ administered to patients 
with hATTR amyloidosis who received patisiran during the treatment period of HELIOS-A, then 
switched to treatment with vutrisiran during the randomized treatment extension (RET) period. This 
analysis comprises 3 questions, as outlined further below, to determine (1) the patients’ overall 
preference for vutrisiran or patisiran, (2) how strongly they feel about that preference, and (3) the 
reason for their preference. The survey included 37 patients who were initially assigned to patisiran 
during the treatment period of pivotal trial, and then switched to vutrisiran in the extension phase of 
the study. Data from Month 9 on the RTE period were available for 17 of these patients.  Fifteen out of 
17 patients (88%) indicated that they prefer the method of administration with vutrisiran to that of 
patisiran, while 2 (12%) preferred patisiran.  The time needed to receive one administration, and the 
frequency of administration were the two most frequent reasons given as the reason for this

preference.   In addition, one third of patients cited less emotional anxiety or distress with the SC 
injections.   
Real word evidence data were submitted of patients who experienced substantial difficulties with the IV 
infusion due to lack of venous access and complications like lymphangitis, and were successfully 
converted to vutrisiran in a compassionate use program. 
Considering the above data, the COMP concluded that a major contribution to patient care of vutrisiran 
compared to patisiran has been demonstrated. This together with the clinical data which showed that 
vutrisiran is of comparable efficacy with patisiran are sufficient to demonstrate significant benefit of 
vutrisiran versus patisiran.

4.  COMP position adopted on 25 July 2022 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) 
was estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be 1.8 in 10,000 persons in the 
European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to the development of 
polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy; 
although satisfactory methods for the treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union, the assumption that Amvuttra may be of potential significant benefit to those 
affected by the orphan condition still holds. The sponsor has submitted clinical data demonstrating 
that vutrisiran is efficacious in a subset of patients with moderate-severe renal impairment for 
whom inotersen is contraindicated. In addition, the clinical data showed that vutrisiran is of 
comparable efficacy with patisiran and also demonstrating a major contribution to patient care 
compared to patisiran.  
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Amvuttra, synthetic double-
stranded siRNA oligonucleotide targeted against transthyretin mRNA, with six phosphorothioate 
linkages in the backbone, and nine 2'-fluoro and thirty-five 2'-O-methyl nucleoside residues in the 
sequence, which is covalently linked via a phosphodiester group to a ligand containing three N-
acetylgalactosamine residues, vutrisiran for treatment of transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis 
(EU/3/18/2026) is not removed from the Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

Co-administration of ZEPATIER with sunitinib may increase 
information regarding drug-drug interaction (DDI) of 
Labelling and 
sunitinib concentrations leading to an increased risk of 
elbasvir/grazoprevir when co-administrated with 
sunitinib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor). The Package 
Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the 
Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the 
opportunity to include some editorial changes.

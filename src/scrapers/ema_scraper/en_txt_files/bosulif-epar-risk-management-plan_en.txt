Incidence: 
Europe – Data from 44 European cancer registries, which include national registries 
covering the entire populations of Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Ireland, England, N. Ireland, 
Scotland, Wales, Austria, Malta, Slovenia, and Slovakia, estimated overall incidence from a 
total of 21,796 myeloid malignancies (which included 2,468 incident cases of CML) in the 
period 2000 to 2002.  The 44 registries, divided into 5 different regions, estimated a crude 
incidence rate of 1.10 cases per 100,000 (1.23 males, 0.98 females).1  Incidence was
estimated according to age at diagnosis which ranged from 0 to 99 years.
The age-standardised incidence rates (per 100,000) for each region are listed in Table 1

rate for the 2013 to 2017 period is 1.9 per 100,000 individuals per year, with males having 
nearly twice the overall rate as females (2.5/100,000 versus 1.5/100,000).

Overall, in the US, 9,110 new cases of CML (5,150 males, 3,960 females) is estimated to be 
diagnosed in 2021 along with 1,220 expected deaths (680 males, 540 females).3
Prevalence:
Europe - Orphanet Report Series, a consortium of European partners that provides, among 
other services, a public database of drugs with an orphan designation along with prevalence 
numbers cited from various data sources (www.orpha.net),4 cites CML as having a 
prevalence of 6 per 100,000 persons.  With the population of the EU at approximately 
448 million5 a rough estimate of the number of CML cases in the EU would be about
26,880 persons as of January 2021. 
US - According to SEER data, the number of people alive with CML in the US on 01 
January 2017 was 58,097 which translates to 0.018% of the US population.  Among these 
33,072 (0.021%) were male and 25,025 (0.015%) were women.6
Demographics of the population in the authorised proposed indication – age, gender,
racial and/or ethnic origin and risk factors for the disease:
Below is a summary of the demographic characteristics from the SEER database including 
age and sex of patients diagnosed with CML.
Age: Incidence rates increase nearly 8-fold from below age 65 to ages 65 and over with 
similar patterns between blacks and whites.
Sex: The overall age-adjusted incidence rate (2013 to 2017) is 1.9 per 100,000 with males 
having nearly twice the overall rate as females (2.5/100,000 versus 1.5/100,000).
Page 12
Risk Factors for the Disease
The risk factors for CML include:
 Age: the risk is increasing with age
 Gender: male > female; ratio 1.4:1
 High dose radiation or benzene exposure
The main existing treatment options:
Treatment options for patients with CML depend on the phase of their disease, their age,
their co-morbidities, the availability of a matching stem cell donor, and response and
tolerability to prior drug treatment for CML.
For adult patients in CP, the standard treatment is a TKI.  Imatinib mesylate was the first 
approved drug in front-line therapy (December 2002) based on the results of the IRIS trial.  
One thousand one hundred six (1106) patients were randomised to receive imatinib 400 mg 
QD versus interferon-alpha plus low dose cytarabine.  The primary endpoint of this trial was 
EFS.  Events were defined as first occurrence of any of the following while on treatment: 
death from any cause, progression to AP or BP, loss of CHR, or loss of MCyR; EFS was
measured from the initiation of therapy with imatinib (after cross over) until occurrence of 
any of the events hereof described.  The estimated EFS at 48 months after initiation of 
imatinib following crossover was 86%.  After a median follow-up of 19 months, the 
estimated rate of a MCyR was 87.1% in the imatinib arm and 34.7% in the interferon-alpha 
plus cytarabine arm.  The estimated rates of CCyR were 76.2% and 14.5%, respectively.  At 
18 months, the estimated rate of freedom from progression to AP or BP was 96.7% in the 
imatinib arm and 91.5% in the combination-therapy arm.7  Long-term follow-up data
(median follow-up of 60 months) have demonstrated that continuous treatment with imatinib 
induces a high rate of durable responses and a decreasing rate of relapse in patients with CP 
CML.8,9  The most frequently reported AEs included GI disturbances, oedema, rash, 
musculoskeletal complaints, and, in a small group of patients, hypophosphataemia associated 
in mineral bone changes.  Grade 3 and Grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopaenia were 
reported.  Congestive heart failure and cardiotoxicity have been reported; however, the 
incidence rate has been considered similar to the general population.
Since most patients have shown variable levels of residual molecular disease at the standard 
dosage of 400 mg, several studies have addressed the question of high dose therapy with 
imatinib.  The TIDEL trial10,11 demonstrated superior response rates for higher doses of 
imatinib (600 mg) while the TOPS trial12 reported that high dose imatinib (800 mg) was 
associated with more rapid responses and MMR and CCyR identical for both doses.  The 
German CML IV trial13,14 confirmed a faster response with imatinib 800 mg compared to 
400 mg in low and intermediate risk patients but not in high risk patients.  However, imatinib 
800 mg has not been shown to have lower rates of disease progression than standard dose
imatinib and it is associated with higher rates of dose interruption, reductions, or permanent 
discontinuation due to Grade 3/4 AEs.
In addition to imatinib, second generation TKIs are now approved and available for front-line
treatment of CML: bosutinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib.
Page 13
Bosutinib is a small molecule, selective inhibitor of SRC and ABL non-receptor tyrosine 
kinases. The initial approval of bosutinib was based on the data from CT 3160A4-200-WW 
(B1871006), a non-randomised, single-arm CT which included approximately 570 subjects 
with Ph+ CML in CP, AP, or BP who had failed treatment with 1 or more TKI(s) including 
imatinib.  For the reference population of CP Ph+ CML (subjects previously treated with 
imatinib and either 1 or both of the then second generation TKIs [dasatinib and/or nilotinib]),
bosutinib demonstrated substantial and durable efficacy as evidenced by MCyR and CCyR 
being attained or maintained by 38.9% and 30.6% of subjects, respectively.  These MCyRs 
were maintained in over two-thirds of responding subjects after 2 years.  Only 5 of the 117 
CP Ph+ CML subjects with a valid post-baseline haematologic assessment of CP Ph+ CML 
in the reference population experienced disease transformation to AP or BP Ph+ CML while 
on bosutinib treatment. The 2-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of Progression-Free Survival and 
OS were 73.2% and 82.9%, respectively.  Furthermore, bosutinib efficacy was comparable in 
subjects who had 1 or more Ph+ CML mutations at baseline and subjects without a mutation, 
and, notably, CyRs were seen in subjects with mutations that would be expected to impart 
clinical resistance to dasatinib and/or nilotinib.
Subsequently, based on the results of CT AV001 (a Phase 3, multicentre, randomised,
open-label study of bosutinib versus imatinib in adult patients with newly-diagnosed CP
CML) that demonstrated bosutinib at 400 mg daily was an effective and safe treatment option
for patients with newly-diagnosed CP CML, bosutinib was approved for the treatment of
adult patients with newly-diagnosed CP Ph+ CML. CT AV001 met its primary and
secondary Month 12 efficacy objectives and demonstrated that the proportion of subjects 
with MMR at 12 months (48 weeks) and CCyR by 12 months in the modified intention to 
treat population were statistically significantly higher in the bosutinib arm compared to the 
imatinib arm (MMR at 12 months [48 weeks]: bosutinib arm 47.2%, imatinib arm 36.9%;
CCyR by 12 months: bosutinib arm 77.2%, imatinib arm 66.4%).  CT AV001 also
demonstrated clinically and statistically significant improvement of bosutinib over imatinib 
with earlier as well as deeper molecular responses.  Although relatively similar, numerically 
fewer transformation events (from CP CML to AP/BP CML) and fewer mutations at the end
of treatment were observed.
The safety profile of bosutinib includes diarrhoea, liver enzyme elevation, and 
thrombocytopaenia.  The most commonly reported TEAEs of any toxicity grade (incidence
20%) were diarrhoea (70.1%), nausea, and thrombocytopaenia (35.1% each), ALT
increased (30.6%), and AST increased (22.8%).  The most commonly reported Grade 3 or 4 
TEAEs (5%) were ALT increased (19%), thrombocytopaenia (13.8), AST increased (9.7%), 
lipase increased (9.7%), diarrhoea (7.8%), and neutropenia (6.7%).
Dasatinib is a potent, orally available small molecule, dual inhibitor of ABL and Src family 
of kinases that binds to both the active and inactive conformation of the ABL kinase domain.  
Dasatinib was shown in vitro to be effective against all imatinib-resistant mutations with the 
exception of the T315I.  The DASISION trial15,16,17 compared the efficacy and safety of
dasatinib (100 mg QD) to imatinib (400 mg QD) in first-line treatment of CML.  The
responses were higher and faster achieved with dasatinib; the Confirmed CCyR at 12 months 
were 77% for dasatinib compared to 66% for imatinib and MMR was 46% versus 28%, 
respectively.  Cumulative response rates by 24 months in dasatinib and imatinib arms were: 
Page 14
CCyR in 86% versus 82%, MMR in 64% versus 46%, and BCR-ABL reduction to <0.0032% 
(4.5-log reduction) in 17% versus 8%.  Median time to CCyR calculated by competing risks
analysis was 3.2 months with dasatinib and 6.0 months with imatinib; however, OS was 
identical in both groups.  The safety profile was also shown to be similar.
The safety profile of dasatinib includes cytopenias manageable with dose modifications.  
Dasatinib is associated with a significant but reversible inhibition of platelet aggregation and, 
therefore, increased risk of bleeding.  Pleural effusion is an AE that was reported in 29% of
patients with CP CML, 50% of patients with AP CML, and 33% of patients with BP CML 
and led to the dose interruption in 83% of patients and dose reductions in 71% of patients. 
Patients having a prior cardiac history and patients with arterial hypertension are at increased 
risk of developing a pleural effusion.  This was also shown for patients receiving a twice
daily schedule of treatment (70 mg).  Reversible pulmonary arterial hypertension was 
reported as a rare condition associated to dasatinib.  Lymphocytosis from the clonal
expansion of the natural killer t cells lymphocytes has been reported and seems to be
associated to increase incidences of pleural effusions however additional data are needed to 
confirm these data.
Another second generation of TKI, nilotinib, is a highly selective inhibitor of BCR-ABL 
tyrosine kinase and has been shown to be more potent than imatinib in imatinib-resistant cell 
lines as well as in imatinib-sensitive cell lines.  Nilotinib is indicated for the treatment of
adult patients with newly-diagnosed Ph+ CML in the CP.
The ENESTnd trial18,19,20 of first-line therapy in CP CML compared the efficacy and safety
of nilotinib, 300 mg BID or 400 mg BID, to imatinib 400 mg QD.  Patients treated with 
nilotinib had a significant improvement in the time to progression to AP or BP.  Superior 
rates of CCyR and MMR were observed for both doses of nilotinib compared to imatinib and 
across all Sokal risk groups.  The MMR rates at 12 months were 44% for nilotinib 300 mg 
BID, 43% for nilotinib 400 mg BID, and 22% for imatinib 400 mg QD.
The CCyR rates by 12 months were 80% for the 300 mg dose, 78% for the 400 mg dose and 
65% for imatinib 400 mg dose.
The treatment arm of nilotinib 300 mg BID showed the lowest rate of discontinuation related 
to AEs and was approved by the Food and Drug Administration.  The long-term follow-up 
data confirmed the superiority of nilotinib in inducing molecular responses.
As second line therapy, nilotinib was tested at the dose of 400 mg BID.  In imatinib-resistant 
patients, long-term follow-up results confirmed that responses observed were durable with no 
change in safety profile.
In patients with AP CML resistant or intolerant to imatinib, rapid and durable responses with 
a favourable risk/benefit profile have been seen.  In patients with BP CML resistant or 
intolerant to imatinib, the response observed was not durable.
Regarding safety, nilotinib was rarely associated with fluid retention, oedema or muscle 
cramps.  An increased risk of QT interval prolongation and sudden death of cardiac origin 
Page 15
has been reported in patients treated by nilotinib.  In addition, nilotinib may be associated 
with an increased risk of vascular AEs including peripheral arterial occlusive disease.
Ponatinib, a potent orally available multi-targeted TKI, has also been developed to treat 
patients with CML and is shown to be active against many kinase domain mutations 
including the T315I mutation.  The present indication for ponatinib is for the treatment of 
adult patients with CP, AP, or BP CML that is resistant or intolerant to prior TKIs or those
who have the T315I mutation.
The PACE trial21,22 evaluated the safety and efficacy of ponatinib in patients resistant or 
intolerant to prior TKI therapy or presenting with the T315I mutation.  The primary endpoint 
was MCyR at any time within 12 months after initiation of therapy for patients in CP CML
and MaHR at any time within 6 months after initiation of therapy for patients in AP or BP
CML.
Two hundred sixty-seven (267) patients with CP CML were enrolled and the results were as
follow: 56% MCyR (51% of patients with resistance to or unacceptable AEs from nilotinib or 
dasatinib and 70% presenting the T315I mutation).
In the AP CML and BP CML cohorts, 83 patients and 62 patients, respectively, were enrolled 
and MaHR was 55% and 31%, respectively.
In the CP cohort, the responses induced were durable and higher in patients with T315I 
mutation.  The estimated rate of sustained MCyR of at least 12 months was 91%.
Further analysis showed that young age, less exposure to prior TKIs, and shorter duration of 
leukaemia were predictive factors for response.
Ponatinib induced haematologic and CyRs in patients with advanced CML and therefore 
ponatinib was approved in all 3 phases of CML resistant or intolerant to prior TKIs.
The safety profile for ponatinib includes rash, dry skin, abdominal pain, headache, and 
pancreatitis. Thrombocytopaenia and neutropenia were the most frequent Grade 
3/4 toxicities evidenced.  Ponatinib is also associated with events of fluid retention (oedema, 
ascites, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion).  Serious venous and arterial thromboembolic
events have also been reported including fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, stenosis of
arterial vessels of the brain, severe peripheral vascular disease, and the need for urgent
revascularisation procedures observed in at least 27% of patients.
In conclusion, imatinib, bosutinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib may all be considered as options
for the first-line treatment of CP CML.  Bosutinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, and ponatinib are 
options for patients with CP, AP, or BP CML intolerant or resistant to imatinib, with 
ponatinib being particularly active in patients with the T315I mutation.
Omacetaxine (homoharringtonine, a cephalotaxus alkaloid) is a protein synthesis inhibitor 
demonstrating activity against CML lines including the 1 showing T315I mutation.
Page 16
Omacetaxine was shown to be effective in a study evaluating CP and AP CML patients 
resistant to a minimum of 2 therapies with a TKI.  It was also shown to be effective in 
patients harbouring the T315I mutation who had failed prior TKI therapy.23,24,25,26
The safety profile was considered acceptable and the most common AEs were 
thrombocytopaenia, anaemia, diarrhoea, neutropenia, and nausea.  Treatment-related 
Grade 3/4 haematological events included thrombocytopaenia, neutropenia, anaemia,
leucopenia, and febrile neutropenia.
Allogeneic HSCT is the only potentially curative treatment for patients with CML.  The 
favourable results encountered with TKIs and the variety of treatment available for refractory 
patients, in addition to the limitation of donor availability and significant morbidity 
associated with HSCT, have limited its use as first-line therapy.
Recent advances in using alternative donor sources (cord blood, unrelated donors), 
non-myeloablative reduced intensity preparative regimens, and more accurate human
leucocyte antigen typing of unrelated donors makes it an appropriate treatment in first-line 
treatment for patients with BP CML at initial presentation at diagnosis.  Haematopoietic stem
cell transplantation may also be considered for patients with T315I mutation or other BCR-
ABL mutations conferring resistance to any TKI therapy or for rare patients intolerant to all 
TKIs.
Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including 
mortality and morbidity:
CML is a myeloproliferative disorder characterised by a reciprocal t(9;22)(q34;q11) 
translocation that results in the formation of the Ph chromosome containing the BCR-ABL1 
(hereafter referred to as BCR-ABL) oncogene.27 The BCR-ABL oncogene encodes the 
BCR-ABL kinase that activates several downstream signalling pathways, which mediate 
myeloproliferation, resistance to apoptosis, and genetic instability.  The BCR-ABL gene is
observed in all cases of CML, and detection of the gene together with identification of the Ph 
chromosome by karyotyping is used to confirm the diagnosis of CML.28  In most patients 
with CML, BCR-ABL transcripts are characterised by b2a2 and/or b3a2 junctions.29
CML comprises 3 distinct phases, which are differentiated by clinical characteristics and 
laboratory findings: a CP, an AP, and a BP.  CML is usually diagnosed in the CP.27,28,29  
Patients may present with fatigue, anaemia, splenomegaly, abdominal discomfort, or 
infections, but often are asymptomatic, with diagnosis occurring after evaluation of routine 
blood work for an unrelated medical reason. Untreated CML commonly progresses within
3 to 5 years to blast crisis, also termed BP, usually preceded by an AP.  Disease progression 
is characterised by a progressive loss of white blood cell differentiation and is defined by a
blast cell count of 15-29% (peripheral blood) in AP and 30% (blood and/or marrow) in
BP.30  BP CML, which resembles acute leukaemia, generally leads to patient death due to
infection, thrombosis, or anaemia.
Page 17
CML accounts for 20% of adult leukaemias.31  The number of new cases of CML has been 
estimated as 1.8 per 100,000 men and women per year in the US32 and 1.2 per 100,000 men 
and women per year in the UK.33
Important co-morbidities:
Important co-morbidities for CML are the following:
 Liver and renal dysfunction34,35,36,37,38
 Diabetes35,36,39,40,41
 Hypertension35,40,41
 Cardiovascular diseases35,36,38,41

Module SII. Non-Clinical Part of the Safety Specification
Non-clinical in vitro and in vivo safety studies have been conducted with bosutinib to support
clinical studies. These non-clinical studies were primarily conducted in rat and dog based on 
the similarity of metabolic profiles to human and suitable PK profiles.  The majority of in
vivo studies were conducted with oral dosing, the intended route of administration in 
humans.  Study types included safety pharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity (up to 9 months 
duration), reproductive and developmental toxicity, genetic toxicity, carcinogenicity, and 
phototoxicity studies.
Based on the non-clinical studies conducted with bosutinib, the primary toxicities observed 
relative to humans were in the GI tract and with human ether-a-go-go channel interactions.  
Additional findings identified following bosutinib administration included an effect on 
fertility and embryo foetal development.  Other findings of uncertain risk to humans included 
lymphoid atrophy and central nervous system effects.
Table 3 below describes the non-clinical safety findings that have potential relevance to 
human use.
Table 3. Key Safety Findings and Relevance to Human Usage
Key Safety findings from Non-clinical Studies
Gastrointestinal toxicity: GI effects were primarily 
observed in rats as clinical signs of decreased body weight 
and food consumption.  Higher doses that were more 
severely toxic included clinical signs of dehydration, faecal 
alterations, red pigment around nose and mouth, yellow 
discoloration of perineal pelage, high carriage, thin and
hunched appearance. Similar findings were reported in 
dogs.
Immunotoxicity: Lymphoid atrophy in thymus, lymph 
nodes and spleen was observed in rats treated with 
bosutinib.  These effects were mild and reversible.
Although the possibility of the direct toxic effect of 
bosutinib in the lymphoid organs cannot be ruled out, the 
morphologic changes in lymphoid tissues are consistent
with findings secondary to overt toxicity (increased 
endogenous corticosterone).  There was no evidence of 
compromised immune function in either rats or dogs.
Genotoxicity: Bosutinib was not genotoxic in in vitro or in 
vivo assays.
Carcinogenicity: Bosutinib was not carcinogenic in a 2-
year rat carcinogenicity study (09_0837).
In the 6-month transgenic rasH2 mouse carcinogenicity
study, daily oral gavage administration of 6, 20, or 60 
mg/kg/day PF-05208763 to transgenic hemizygous rasH2 
mice for up to 26 weeks had no effect on survival and 
produced no carcinogenic effects.  
Renal toxicity: In toxicity studies of bosutinib of durations
up to 6 months in rats and 9 months in dogs, there were no 
drug-related histological effects on the kidney and no 
Page 19
Relevance to Human Usage
Bosutinib has been shown to cause 
gastrointestinal adverse events in humans.
There has been no evidence of compromised 
immune function in humans.
Bosutinib is not expected to have any
genotoxic effects.
Bosutinib is not expected to be carcinogenic 
when used in humans.
The relevance of the non-clinical renal
findings to humans is not clear.  No effects on 
plasma creatinine were noted in animals, but 
Table 3. Key Safety Findings and Relevance to Human Usage
Relevance to Human Usage
this parameter was not measured in the 2-year 
carcinogenicity study.
Bosutinib has the potential to impair 
reproductive function, affect fertility, and 
cause developmental abnormalities in humans.
It is not known whether bosutinib is excreted 
in human milk.  A potential risk to the breast-
feeding infant cannot be excluded.  Breast-
feeding should be discontinued during
treatment with bosutinib.
Based on the results from rat juvenile toxicity 
studies, growth effects are not expected in 
humans.
Key Safety findings from Non-clinical Studies
changes in kidney function as measured by plasma 
creatinine or blood urea nitrogen.  The unbound exposure 
margins in these studies relative to the human exposure 
following the 500 mg dose were 1.5, and 1.2 in male and 
female dogs, and 2.0, and 6.0 in male and female rats,
respectively.  In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats, 
renal tubular atrophy was observed at an increased 
incidence, but not severity, relative to vehicle-treated rats 
at unbound exposure margins of 1.4 in males and 2.8 in 
females, relative to the human exposure at the 500 mg 
dose.
Reproductive and development toxicity: In rat fertility 
studies, bosutinib reduced male fertility, increased 
embryonic resorptions and reduced the number of viable
embryos in females.  The administration of bosutinib in the 
reproductive and developmental toxicity studies resulted in 
a reduction in the number of viable foetuses in both rats 
and rabbits as well as decreases in foetal body weight and 
foetal abnormalities.  No adverse reproductive effects were 
seen at exposures in female rats at 0.2-fold or in female 
rabbits at 0.7-fold the exposures reported in humans 
treated with the approved dose of 500 mg/day.
Study 17GR319 investigated the effects of bosutinib on 
rate pre- and post-natal development.  The highest dose at 
which no adverse developmental effects occurred was 10 
mg/kg/day, which results in exposure equal to 1.3x the 
human exposure resulting from the clinical dose of 400 mg
(based on unbound AUC in the respective species)
(Module 4.2.3.5.2 RPT-17GR319).
Lactation: Bosutinib and/or its metabolites were excreted 
in the milk of lactating rats.  Radioactivity was present in 
the plasma of suckling offspring 24 to 48 hours after 
lactating rats received a single oral dose of radioactive 
bosutinib.
Effects in juveniles: Studies with bosutinib in 4-week old 
rats indicated significant decreases in IGFBP-3 but non-
significant effects on body weight gain42 or bone length.43
In a rat juvenile toxicity study in 7-day old rats, no effects
on body weight gain, GH, IGFBP-1, or bone length were 
observed at the highest tolerated dose level.
Study 13GR351 evaluated the potential effects of bosutinib 
on neonatal growth and development in juvenile rats.  
Potential effects on bone metabolism were evaluated via 
measurement of femur length, hormones analysis (growth 
hormone, insulin-like growth factor-1), clinical pathology 
evaluation (ALP, calcium, phosphorus), macroscopic
examination (bone with marrow, thyroid with parathyroid),
organ weight (thyroid with parathyroids), and 
histopathological examination (femur, stifle joint).  The 
oral administration of bosutinib at 3 mg/kg had no effect

Metabolites of bosutinib are unlikely to be 
associated with adverse effects.
Bosutinib has a low potential to cause
phototoxic effects in humans.
Bosutinib has a low potential to cause CNS 
effects in humans.
Bosutinib is unlikely to cause adverse
respiratory events in humans.
Based on the hERG assay, there is a low 
potential for bosutinib to cause QTc interval 
prolongation.
There is a low potential for bosutinib to cause 
cardiovascular effects in patients.
Key Safety findings from Non-clinical Studies
on any bone metabolism parameters evaluated, with 
systemic exposure (mean total Cmax and AUC)
approximately 8x and 7.4x, respectively, the human 
exposure at the proposed dose of 400 mg.  Mortality and 
moribundity precluded evaluation of potential effects on 
bone metabolism at higher doses.
Studies with oxydechlorinated bosutinib (M2)
metabolite: The prominent circulating metabolites in 
humans had much lower activity in cellular assays than 
bosutinib.  Dosing of rats with the M2 had no treatment-
related clinical signs, effects on body weight, food 
consumption, ophthalmoscopic parameters, clinical 
pathology, organ weights, or macroscopic or microscopic 
findings (see 2.6.6, Toxicology Written Summary,
Section 8.4.1).
Phototoxicity: Bosutinib was evaluated for its phototoxic
potential in rats.  High concentrations of bosutinib in the 
skin and uveal tract of pigmented rats were not associated 
with phototoxicity following challenge with UVR
exposure.
General Safety Pharmacology: 
 The safety pharmacology of bosutinib was characterised
for the CNS and respiratory systems in female rats, and 
for the cardiovascular system.  
 In vitro hERG potassium ion channel assays were 
conducted (see 2.4, Non-Clinical Overview, Section 2.3).
CNS Effects: CNS effects were limited to greater 
incidences of impaired gait and decreased pupil size in 
groups of rats receiving high doses of bosutinib, a dose 
which resulted in a greater than 8-fold the exposure of 
subjects treated with the approved dose of 500 mg/day (see 
2.4, Non-Clinical Overview, Section 2.3).
Respiratory Effects: Bosutinib was administered to rats in 
order to evaluate the potential effects on the respiratory 
system.  No adverse effects on the respiratory system were
observed (see 2.4, Non-Clinical Overview, Section 2.3).
hERG assays: Bosutinib inhibited the hERG potassium 
ion current in a concentration-dependent manner with 
calculated IC50s of 0.3 μM (159 ng/mL) and 0.7 μM 
(371 ng/mL).  The lower of the 2 values (0.3 M) is 12.6-
fold above the unbound Cmax in humans (23.8 nM, 
12.6 ng/mL) following administration of the 500 mg dose 
(see 2.4, Non-Clinical Overview, Section 2.3).
Cardiovascular Safety (including potential for QT 
interval prolongation): A cardiovascular safety study of 
oral doses of bosutinib (Module 4.2.1.3 RPT-51769) in 
dogs did not produce changes in blood pressure.  No
abnormal atrial or ventricular arrhythmias were detected in 
this study and there was no bosutinib-related prolongation 
of the PR, QRS, or QTc interval of the ECG.  An increase 
in heart rate was observed at about 22 hours post-dose.
Page 21
Table 3. Key Safety Findings and Relevance to Human Usage
Key Safety findings from Non-clinical Studies
A study comparing the cardiovascular effects of bosutinib 
to imatinib was assessed by echocardiography (Module 
4.2.1.3 Report SP3810) in S-D rats.  Increases in heart 
weight and structural changes consistent with hypertrophy 
were observed in imatinib-treated, but not bosutinib-
treated rats.  This exposure was approximately 1.5-fold the 
human area AUC following administration of the 500 mg 
dose.  Rats were treated with bosutinib for 6 months in a 
cardiovascular study incorporating echocardiography
(Module 4.2.1.3 RPT-SP6211) at doses resulting in up to 
approximately 4-times the clinical exposure following the 
500 mg dose.  There were no functional changes as 
measured by echocardiography resulting from bosutinib 
treatment in the study.44
Mechanisms for drug interactions: In vitro, bosutinib 
has been shown to be an inhibitor of P-gp.
Relevance to Human Usage
Bosutinib has a low potential of cardiac 
hypertrophy and any functional changes as 
measured by echocardiography.
The potential for bosutinib to inhibit P-gp and 
to increase the intestinal absorption of drugs 
that are substrates of P-gp was not confirmed 
in a Phase 1 clinical study in healthy subjects, 
as bosutinib did not affect the systemic
exposure of dabigatran.
Module SIII. Clinical Trial Exposure
SIII.1. Brief Overview of Development
Bosutinib is approved for the treatment of adult patients with CP, AP, or BP Ph+ CML 
previously treated with 1 or more TKI(s) and for whom imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib are
not considered appropriate treatment options, and for the treatment of adult patients with 
newly-diagnosed CP Ph+ CML.
Cumulatively, it was estimated that 3058 subjects worldwide had participated in the Pfizer 
bosutinib clinical development programme, 2456 of whom had been exposed to bosutinib 
either as a single agent, in combination with placebo, or in combination with other study 
drugs, as detailed below.


2151 subjects had been exposed to bosutinib as a single agent (including 58 subjects who
had been exposed to bosutinib in combination with placebo).
305 subjects had been exposed to bosutinib in combination with other study drugs 
(ie, aprepitant, capecitabine, dabigatran, exemestane, ketoconazole, lansoprazole, 
letrozole, moxifloxacin, or rifampin).
This RMP is based on the pooled CT results of the safety and tolerability of bosutinib for the 
treatment of adult subjects with Ph+ CML newly-diagnosed CP, second line CP, third line 
CP, fourth line CP, AP, and BP in the 6 leukaemia trials: CTs AV001 (B1871053),

Module SIV. Populations Not Studied in Clinical Trials
SIV.1. Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Studies within the Development 
Programme
There has been limited exposure in special populations in the bosutinib CML CTs and no 
epidemiologic studies have been conducted.  Pregnant/lactating women, paediatric patients 
(age: 17 years), subjects with cardiac impairment, and specific subpopulations with genetic 
polymorphisms were excluded from the CT development programme; PK CTs were 
conducted in subjects with hepatic impairment and in subjects with renal impairment.
Table 15. Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Studies Within the Development 
Programme
Criteria
Reason for Exclusion
Hepatic 
impairment
Ph- CML
Subjects in CTs were required to 
have adequate hepatic function.  
In a study on the effect of hepatic 
impairment, an approximately 2-
fold increase in bosutinib 
exposures was observed in the 
hepatically impaired (Child-Pugh 
Classes A, B, and C) subjects as 
compared with healthy subjects 
when administered 200 mg of 
bosutinib.  An increased exposure 
above that provided with the 
clinically recommended dose of 
bosutinib could lead to additional 
toxicity.  The frequency of QTc 
interval prolongation, defined as a 
QTc >450 ms, increased with 
declining hepatic function per 
grade of hepatic impairment

Rationale
Use of bosutinib in patients with 
hepatic impairment is

SmPC (Section 4.3).
No
The target of bosutinib is the 
BCR-ABL non-receptor tyrosine 
kinase transcript, present in both 
Ph+ and Ph- CML, and literature 
supports that patients with both
Ph+ and Ph- CML have similar 
natural history of disease and

respond similarly to TKI therapy.45  
These Ph- negative, BCR-ABL+
patients have a similar clinical 
presentation, response to therapy, 
and prognosis as Ph+ CML 
patients.46,47  Ph- CML accounts
for 5% or less of CML patients48
and there are no large Phase 3 CTs 
outlining treatment specifics for 
Ph- patients. It is not possible to 
assess cytogenetic endpoints in 
Ph- patients. However, in recent 
years, the relevance of cytogenetic 
endpoints has decreased, and the 
focus of response assessment has 
switched to molecular monitoring. 
Among the limited number of 
patients with Ph- CML enrolled in 
the bosutinib CTs, some were able 
to achieve/maintain molecular 
responses.
Extramedullary disease is 
associated with BC or impending 
BC, a later stage of disease.  
Bosutinib has a positive benefit-
risk profile in Ph+ CML patients 
with BC.
A negative benefit-risk profile for 
bosutinib would not be expected in 
patients who underwent recent 
major surgery or radiation therapy, 
based on the AE profile of 
bosutinib.
The SmPC provides 
recommendation in Sections 4.4
and 4.5 aimed at mitigating the 
risk of QTc prolongation.  These 
recommendations are considered 
sufficient, allowing the physician 
to make an assessment of the 
benefit-risk for the individual 
patient without a need for a 
contraindication.

Guidance is provided to use 
bosutinib with caution in patients 
with recent or ongoing clinically 
significant GI disorders.  There is 
no evidence these clinical events 
have led to safety issues and 
therefore a contraindication is not 
considered warranted at this time.
It is the potential liver 
manifestations of these diagnoses 
that are important.  If any of the 
patients suffering from these 
diseases have hepatic impairment 
(eg, cirrhosis) then use of
bosutinib would be contraindicated 
as stated in Section 4.3 of the 
SmPC.  Hepatitis B reactivation 
has occurred with BCR-ABL 
TKIs.  The SmPC provides a 
recommendation in Section 4.8 to
test patients for HBV infection 
before initiating treatment with 
bosutinib and to closely monitor 
carriers of HBV for signs and 
symptoms of active HBV infection
during treatment. These
recommendations are considered
sufficient without a need for a 
contraindication, allowing the 
physician to make an assessment 
of the benefit-risk for the 
individual patient.
The SmPC provides 
recommendations in Sections 4.4 
and 4.5 aimed at mitigating the 
risk of QTc prolongation including 
that the presence of 
hypomagnesaemia or 
hypokalaemia may further increase
the risk.  These recommendations 
are considered sufficient without a 
need for a contraindication. In a 
single-dose oral dog

SIV.2. Limitations to Detect Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trial Development 
Programmes
The clinical development programme is unlikely to detect certain types of ARs such as rare 
ARs, ARs with a long latency, and ARs caused by prolonged exposure.
SIV.3. Limitations in Respect to Populations Typically Under-Represented in Clinical 
Trial Development Programmes
Table 16 lists the patient populations that have been under-represented in CTs in the 
bosutinib clinical development programme.
Page 36
Table 16. Exposure of special populations included or not in clinical trial
development programmes
Exposure
Elderly subjects accounted for 287 (21.3%) of the subjects enrolled in the 
6 pooled leukaemia CTsb (N = 1348, total person years exposure = 4579) 
and received 731 (16.0%) person years exposure.
Not included in the MAH’s clinical development programme.  However, a 
Phase 1/2 paediatric CT being conducted by an external cooperative group 
as part of a clinical research collaboration, with the data to be transferred to 
the MAH, enrolled its first subject in November 2016.
Although pregnancy and lactation are exclusion criteria for bosutinib CTs, 
as of the DLP there were 14 cases in the CT database that reported 
pregnancy (including 7 that reported exposure via father) in bosutinib CTs.
Eighteen (18) subjects with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment 
were administered bosutinib in CT 3160A4-1111-EU which examined the 
effect of hepatic impairment on the PKs of bosutinib.
Subjects with creatinine >1.5 x the ULN were excluded from the CML CTs.  
In CT B1871020, the PKs, safety, and tolerability of single doses of 
bosutinib in 26 subjects with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment 
were investigated.
Although Patients with Cardiac Impairment are exclusion criteria for 
bosutinib CTs, as of the DLP there were 180 cases in the CT database that 
reported a history of Cardiac Impairment.
Although Patients with Recent or Ongoing Clinically Significant GI
Disorders are exclusion criteria for bosutinib CTs, as of the DLP there were

Module SV. Post-Authorisation Experience
Based on estimates of exposure to commercial bosutinib in Europe and Asia (excluding 
Japan) (33 countries), the US, Japan, and Canada, a total of 35,317 patients worldwide are 
estimated to have been exposed to bosutinib commercially since bosutinib was approved.
However, given that it is expected that a limited number of patients are treated with bosutinib 
in the 1st line setting, the 1st line indication has not been taken into account in this calculation.  
Given the longer duration of treatment in the 1st line, the calculated number of patients 
exposed to commercial bosutinib might be overestimated.  
Based on ongoing safety surveillance of post-marketing reports, bosutinib is used primarily
in patients with Ph+ CML previously treated with 1 or more TKI(s).  There are a small 
number of post-marketing cases of use in paediatric patients (17 years of age) reported.  
Evaluation of these cases has not identified any new safety signals pertaining to the use of 
bosutinib.
Off-label use is routinely monitored and discussed in the PSUR.  Generally, the most 
commonly reported off-label indications are ALL and AML.  However, the total number of 
ALL and AML cases is low and the AEs reported in association with these uses are
consistent with the known safety profile of bosutinib; thus, the MAH does not consider that 
off-label use in ALL and AML should be classified as missing information.
As noted above, overall, only a few cases of bosutinib use in paediatric patients have been 
received since marketing approval.  Therefore, use in paediatric patients will continue to be 
considered missing information.
SV.1. Post-Authorisation Exposure
SV.1.1. Method Used to Calculate Exposure: Europe and Asia (excluding Japan)
The estimated commercial patient exposure in Europe and Asia (excluding Japan) was 
calculated based on internal Pfizer financial reports that contain bosutinib volumes sold 
(number of stock keeping units) in the Pfizer European Region which consists of the 
following 33 European and Asian (excluding Japan) countries: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, 
Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, 
Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, 
Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, UK and
Ukraine.
SV.1.2. Exposure: Europe and Asia (excluding Japan)
Cumulatively, it was estimated that 23,121 patients in Europe and Asia (excluding Japan) 
had been exposed to bosutinib commercially since bosutinib was first approved in Europe in 
March 2013; a breakdown of estimated cumulative patient exposure to commercial bosutinib 
by European country is presented in Table 17.

SV.1.3. Methods Used to Calculate Exposure and Exposure: Rest of World, 
Compassionate Use, and Non-Interventional Studies
United States
Method used to calculate exposure: United States
US commercial patient exposure estimates were derived from 2 data sources provided by 
IQVIA (formerly IMS Health): IMS National Prescription Audit Market Dynamics Patient 
Counts and IMS National Sales Perspectives.
Page 39
Exposure: United States
Cumulatively, it was estimated that 8525 patients in the US had been exposed to bosutinib 
commercially since bosutinib was first approved in the US in September 2012.
Japan
Method used to calculate exposure: Japan
Through 31 August 2015, commercial patient exposure in Japan was estimated based on new 
patient starts reported on a weekly basis from sales representatives confirming new starts in 
each institution; projections for future patients were based off these reports.  Beginning 
01 September 2015, commercial patient exposure in Japan was based on sales representatives 
reporting new patient starts on a daily basis rather than on a weekly basis; thus, no future 
projections were included.
Exposure: Japan
Cumulatively, it was estimated that 2884 patients in Japan had been exposed to bosutinib 
commercially since bosutinib was first approved in Japan in September 2014.
Canada
Method used to calculate exposure: Canada
Bosutinib commercial exposure data in Canada are based on internal sales and free goods 
shipments; previously, bosutinib commercial exposure data in Canada were limited to only 
patient enrolment numbers in a Pfizer reimbursement assistance programme.
Exposure: Canada
Cumulatively, it was estimated that 787 patients in Canada had been exposed to bosutinib 
commercially since bosutinib was first approved in Canada in March 2014.  
Compassionate Use
Method Used to Calculate Exposure: Compassionate Use
The cumulative number of CU patients who received bosutinib is not an estimate but rather is
known, as CU requests are processed and tracked on an individual basis by the MAH who 
provides clinical drug supply to patients meeting the criteria for participation in the CU
programme.
However, because bosutinib has achieved approval status in a number of countries since its 
initial approval, it is possible that some of the patients who were initially receiving bosutinib 
clinical drug supply through the CU programme transitioned to receive commercial bosutinib 
via prescription.  The MAH is not able to track individual patients once they have
discontinued from the CU programme, so it is possible that the estimate of 35,317 cumulative
patients worldwide who received commercial bosutinib may include some CU patients who 
went on to receive commercial bosutinib once bosutinib was approved in their countries.
Page 40
Exposure: Compassionate Use
Cumulatively, 242 patients worldwide had received bosutinib via CU.
Exposure: Non-Interventional Studies
Cumulatively, it was estimated that 621 patients worldwide had been exposed to bosutinib in 
Pfizer-sponsored NISs.
Module SVI. Additional EU Requirements for the Safety Specification

PART VI. SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN
Summary of risk management plan for Bosulif (bosutinib) 
This is a summary of the RMP for Bosulif. The RMP details important risks of Bosulif, how
these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about Bosulif’s 
risks and uncertainties (missing information).
Bosulif’s SmPC and its PL give essential information to HCPs and patients on how Bosulif 
should be used.
This summary of the RMP for Bosulif should be read in the context of all this information 
including the Assessment Report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which 
is part of the EPAR.
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Bosulif’s RMP.
I. The Medicine and What It Is Used For
Bosulif is authorised for treatment of adult patients with CP, AP, or BP Ph+ CML previously
treated with 1 or more TKIs and for whom imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib are not 
considered appropriate treatment options, and for the treatment of adult patients with newly-
diagnosed CP Ph+ CML (see SmPC for the full indications). It contains bosutinib as the 
active substance and it is given orally.
Further information about the evaluation of Bosulif’s benefits can be found in Bosulif’s
EPAR, including its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines Agency 
(EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage: 
http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/002373/h

II. Risks Associated With the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further
Characterise the Risks
There are no important identified or important potential risks for Bosulif.  
Missing information includes Use in Paediatric Patients.  
Routine risk minimisation activities, which include the use of SmPC and PL are sufficient to 
manage the product.  In addition, information about adverse events is collected continuously 
analysed including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as necessary.  
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.

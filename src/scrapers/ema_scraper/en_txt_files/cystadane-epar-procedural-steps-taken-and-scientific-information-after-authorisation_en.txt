Following the assessment of an updated RMP which 
from the Annex II: Submission of an updated RMP 
which includes description and timelines of the re-
started ROCH registry and of the new E-IMD registry.

Veterinary Medicinal Products - Other variation 
included: 
- Description and timelines of the re-started ROCH registry 
- Description and timelines of the new E-IMD registry  
the CHMP agreed that the above mentioned obligations 
have been fulfilled, and therefore recommends their 
deletion from the Annex II. Both study protocols were 
found acceptable and minor recommendations were made 
for an updated RMP and updated study protocols.

Based upon the data that have become available since the

and PL 
considers that the benefit-risk balance of Cystadane 
remains positive, but considers that its safety profile is to 
be closely monitored for the following reasons:

At licensing time the MAH committed to set up a registry 
(ROCH: Registry for Cystadane - Homocystinuria) to collect 
more data on safety and efficacy of Cystadane.  However, 
from this registry only limited additional data was gathered. 
Therefore this registry was stopped to be replaced by 
another database (E-IMD: European Intoxication type 
Metabolic Disorders). As from neither this new registry nor 
the (restarted) old registry any additional data are available 
yet, the original commitment has been extended, in order 
to receive and analyse enough data from both registries for 
granting a renewal with unlimited validity.  
Therefore, based upon the safety profile of Cystadane, 
which requires the submission of 1- yearly PSURs, the 
CHMP concluded that the MAH should submit one additional 
renewal application in 5 years time.

1.  Introduction 
On 28 Aug 2018, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study CZOL446H2337 in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended. No SmPC update is proposed in this 
procedure. However, the MAH believes that the results of Study are of clinical relevance and should be 
reflected in the EU SmPC and a type 2 variation to update the labelling is planned pending discussions 
with concerned Health Authorities. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
Aclasta® (zoledronic acid) was first registered in Europe for Paget’s disease of bone on 15 Apr 2005 
(via centralized procedure). In 2007, prior to the submission of 2 new indications, (treatment of 
osteoporosis in men at an increased risk of fracture AND treatment of osteoporosis associated with 
long-term systemic glucocorticoid therapy), Novartis agreed with the Paediatric Committee (PDCO) of 
the European Medicines Agency, a Paediatric Investigational Plan (PIP) (EMEA-000057-PIP01-07), in 
accordance with Article 8 of Regulation EC No 1901/2006, as amended, to assess the use of Aclasta in 
children at risk for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIO). The following measure was part of the 
agreed PIP: 
• A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy and safety study of intravenous zoledronic 
acid administered twice yearly compared to placebo in children with glucocorticoid-induced 
osteoporosis (Study CZOL446H2337). This study was initiated in 2008 with Bone Mineral Density 
(BMD) as the primary endpoint as a surrogate for fracture outcome in the paediatric population. 
However, the study was terminated (last patient last visit 05 Mar 2018) after 34 of the planned 92 
patients were enrolled due to several recruitment challenges (see Section 2.2.1) over the years. The 
early study termination plan was communicated to the PDCO on 15 Feb 2017. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Zoledronic acid 0.05 mg/kg (max 5 mg) was administered as intravenous infusion every 6 months. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus 
erythematosus, Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy, and nephrotic syndrome includes glucocorticoid 
therapy, which worsens bone mineral status. Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is now recognized as 
one of the most important reasons for secondary osteoporosis in adults as well as in children. 
Glucocorticoid use confers a substantial increase in vertebral and hip fracture risk in adults. Studies in 
adults suggest that glucocorticoid treatment for 3 months is sufficient to increase fracture risk (van 
Staa et al 2000), and similar data have been collected in children and adolescents where almost one-
half of the fractures were asymptomatic (Leblanc et al 2015). The earliest observation of vertebral 
fractures in children with rheumatic disorders was reported at 4 months after starting systemic 
glucocorticoids (Rodd et al 2012).

regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

Placebo controlled trials in adults using bisphosphonates such as risedronate and alendronate have 
been shown to increase BMD and reduce the risk of vertebral fractures in patients initiating 
glucocorticoids or receiving such a treatment for a longer period of time. Based on these studies, 
regulatory approval for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis, including GIO, has been granted 
for bisphosphonates. There is no established treatment for secondary osteoporosis in children, 
although bisphosphonates have been used experimentally in the treatment of specific paediatric 
metabolic bone disease. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study H2337: title 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
To study efficacy and safety study of intravenous zoledronic acid in osteoporotic children and 
adolescents receiving glucocorticoid therapy within the 12 months preceding screening who manifested 
a lumbar spine BMD Z-score of -0.5 or worse plus evidence of low impact/fragility fracture. 
Study design 
H2337 was an international, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study.  
Study population /Sample size 
The study was designed to recruit 92 patients to obtain 82 evaluable patients for the assessment of the 
primary endpoint. The sample size was calculated based on the objective to show superiority in 
improving lumbar spine BMD Z-score by zoledronic acid relative to placebo at Month 12. The sample 
size estimation considered the standard deviation of 0.93, treatment effect size of 0.63 and a dropout 
rate of 10%. The effect size of 0.63 increase in lumbar spine BMD Z-score was based on the increase 
observed with pamidronate-treated children on chronic glucocorticoid therapy presented in (Acott et al 
2005). The common standard deviation of 0.93 was considered based on the experience from the 
pamidronate study by Acott et al 2005 and the standard deviation obtained from the zoledronic acid 
study in pediatric osteogenesis imperfecta patients (Study CZOL446H2202). 
Treatments 
Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a twice yearly 0.05 mg/kg (max 5 mg) i.v. 
infusion (at least 30 minutes) of zoledronic acid or placebo. Adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium 
was mandatory for the 4 weeks prior to randomization and throughout the duration of the study (i.e. 
12 months) either through adequate dietary intake, supplementation, or a combination of both.   
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate that 0.05 mg/kg (max 5 mg) zoledronic acid 
administered every 6 months is superior to placebo for the change in lumbar spine BMD Z-score at 
Month 12 relative to baseline. 
The secondary objectives were: 
• To evaluate between-treatment differences for the change in lumbar spine BMD Z-score at Month 6 
relative to baseline.

• To evaluate between-treatment differences for the change in lumbar spine and total body bone 
mineral content (BMC) at 6 and 12 months. 
• To evaluate between-treatment differences for the change in serum N-terminal propeptide type I 
collagen (P1NP), bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), cross linked N telopeptide (NTX), and 
tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase isoform 5b (TRAP-5b) at Month 6 and Month 12 relative to 
baseline.  
• To evaluate between-treatment differences for the proportion of patients with new vertebral fractures 
at Month 12 relative to baseline. 
• To evaluate the between-treatment differences for change in vertebral morphometry at Month 12 
relative to baseline. 
• To evaluate the between-treatment differences for change in pain using the Faces Pain Scale-Revised 
(FPS-R) at Months 3, 6, 9 and 12 relative to baseline. 
• To evaluate the between-treatment differences for change in 2nd metacarpal cortical width at Month 
12 relative to baseline. 
• To measure urinary concentration of zoledronic acid at Month 12. 
• The safety objective was to demonstrate that zoledronic acid is safe for the treatment of osteoporotic 
children treated with glucocorticoids through the monitoring of relevant clinical and laboratory safety 
parameters. 
Statistical Methods 
The Intention-to-treat (ITT) population consisted of all randomized patients, whereas the Modified 
Intention-to-treat (MITT) population consisted of all randomized patients who had both baseline and at 
least one post-baseline lumbar spine BMD Z score. The safety population consisted of all patients that 
had been exposed to at least one infusion of the study drug. All efficacy analyses were based on the 
MITT population and safety analyses based on the safety population. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 92 patients were planned to be randomized from approximately 30 centers, to obtain 
evaluable data from at least 82 patients for the primary endpoint. However, a total of 34 patients were 
finally randomized due to the following recruitment challenges over the 9 year course of the study  
(first patient first visit 04 Dec 2008):  
• a screen failure rate of 90% due to patients not meeting inclusion criteria for BMD and/or fractures. 
In particular, there was a low frequency of fractures in children with glucocorticoid-treated rheumatic 
disorders and inflammatory bowel disease; 
• reluctance of parents to enroll children into a study with a placebo-controlled arm; 
• challenges in carrying out a comprehensive bone health study in children with serious underlying 
disorders which contributed to low enrollment and high screen failure; and

• reduced use of glucocorticoids in children to treat rheumatic disorders and inflammatory bowel 
disease in recent years;  
Of the 34 randomized patients, 30 (88.2%) patients completed the study and 4 (11.8%) patients 
discontinued: 
• 3 patients in the zoledronic acid group withdrew consent (one patient each due to conflict of study 
visits with school calendar; desire to be treated with zoledronic acid; and participation in another 
clinical trial)  
• 1 patient in the placebo group discontinued as a result of an adverse event (AE) of fracture. 
Baseline data 
The majority of patients in the MITT population (33 patients) were male, Caucasian, and between 9 to 
17 years of age. The key demographic parameters where median differences between zoledronic acid 
group vs placebo group were observed were as follows: age (15 vs 12.5 years, respectively), standing 
height (155.00 cm vs 146.00 cm), sitting height (80.50 cm vs 72.00 cm), and weight (50.00 kg vs 
42.15 kg). One patient with an extreme weight of 120 kg, sitting height of 141 cm and BMI of 42.52 
kg/m2 was included in the zoledronic acid group. There were 4 (66.7%) female patients in the 
zoledronic acid group with Tanner stage III vs none in the placebo group. Menarche had occurred in 3 
(50.0%) female patients in the zoledronic acid group vs none in the placebo group. 
The median values of the baseline disease characteristics were as follows: lumbar spine BMD Z-score 
(-1.992 vs -2.316), lumbar spine BMC (27.653 g vs 22.037 g), total body BMC (1511 g vs 1072 g), 
Vitamin D (71.0 nmol/L vs 80.5 nmol/L), biomarkers (Serum NTX (29.765 vs 41.630 nmol BCE/L), 
Serum P1NP (177.90 vs 267.85 ng/mL)), and pain scores (0 vs 2.0). The differences observed were, 
however, not statistically significant except for total body BMC. 
The overall patient population randomized in this study (ITT population) included several sub-types of 
rheumatic conditions, inflammatory bowel disease, or Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients as 
summarized in Table 2-1. The number of patients with IBD was higher in the zoledronic acid group 
than in the placebo group (7 vs 2 patients).

Efficacy results 
Lumbar spine BMD Z-score 
The primary endpoint of the Study H2337 was to demonstrate that zoledronic acid administered every 
6 months is superior to placebo for the change in lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) Z-score at 
Month 12 relative to baseline. A statistically significant increase was observed between patients in the 
zoledronic  acid  group  compared  to  patients  in  the  placebo  group  (least  square  (LS)  mean  difference: 
0.425, 95% CI: 0.026, 0.825; p=0.0380) (Table 2-2).  
However,  no  statistically  significant  difference  in  lumbar  spine  BMD  Z-score  was  observed  between 
patients  treated  with  zoledronic  acid  vs  placebo  at  Month  6  (a  secondary  endpoint).  A  between-
treatment difference (increase) of 0.290 from baseline to Month 6 in lumbar spine mean BMD Z-score 
between  patients  in  the  zoledronic  acid  group  and  patients  in  the  placebo  group  was  observed  (95% 
CI: -0.094, 0.673; p=0.1322). 
A larger mean change from baseline (improvement) in the lumbar spine BMD Z-score was observed in 
the zoledronic acid group compared to the placebo group over time (Figure 2-1).

Bone turnover markers 
The effect of zoledronic acid and placebo on four serum biomarkers was investigated at Month 6 and 
Month 12 as secondary endpoints. Changes from baseline in the markers of bone formation (P1NP and 
BSAP) and the markers of bone resorption (NTX and TRAP-5b) were observed as below: 
•  At Month 12, a statistically significant (p<0.05) reduction in 3 bone turnover markers (P1NP, BSAP, 
NTX) was observed in the zoledronic acid group as compared to placebo group: 
• 
P1NP: log-transformed difference= -1.066; 95% CI: -1.770, -0.362; p=0.0049 
•  BSAP: log-transformed difference= -0.484; 95% CI: -0.889, -0.079; p=0.0215 
•  NTX: log-transformed difference= -0.799; 95% CI: -1.170, -0.428; p=0.0002 
The decrease in serum TRAP-5b levels at Month 12 was not statistically significant (log-
transformed difference= -0.207; 95% CI: -0.522, 0.107; p=0.1840). 
•  At Month 6, a statistically significant between-treatment difference (decrease) of 0.476 was 
observed from baseline to Month 6 (95% CI: -0.887, -0.065; p=0.0254) between the two groups 
for serum NTX. For the other 3 biomarkers, the between treatment difference in decrease in log-
transformed values did not reach statistical significance at Month 6.

Lumbar spine and total body BMC 
•  A between-treatment difference of 1.979 was observed between the two groups in lumbar spine 
BMC at Month 6 (95% CI: 0.089, 3.869; p=0.0409), although this difference (2.155) was not 
statistically significant at Month 12 (95% CI: -1.488, 5.798; p=0.2340). 
•  No statistically significant differences in total body BMC were observed between patients treated 
with zoledronic acid vs placebo at 6 or 12 months.

Vertebral fractures 
No new vertebral fractures in the zoledronic acid group were detected as compared to 2 new fractures 
observed  in  the  placebo  group.  In  a  population  of  patients  that  met  the  fracture  inclusion  criteria  for 
this study, this is an important clinical observation, despite the low numbers of patients. 
Other secondary efficacy results 
No  significant  differences  in  vertebral  morphometry,  metacarpal  cortical  width,  and  reduction  in  pain 
were  observed  between  the  two  groups  at  Month  12.  However,  the  metacarpal  cortical  width  data 
showed some numerically higher values for the zoledronic acid group vs placebo. For these endpoints, 
the  number  of  patients  with  assessments  was  low  and  no  conclusions  could  be  made  about  the 
differences. 
Safety results 
Patient exposure 
The  median  duration  for  1st  and  2nd  infusion  as  well  as  the  median  volume  of  these  infusions  were 
similar  between  the  zoledronic  acid  and  placebo  groups.  There  were  no  patients  who  required 
temporary interruption of study drug or dose adjustments due to AEs.  
Concomitant medications 
A total of 61.1% and 56.3% of patients in the zoledronic acid group and placebo group, respectively, 
reported  the  use  of  concomitant  medications  and  significant  non-drug  therapies  before  study  start. 
Corticosteroids of different forms were used most frequently as prior medications in both the zoledronic 
acid group (27.8%) and placebo group (25.0%). 
During the study, all patients in the study were using concomitant medications (ie, those concomitant 
medications that were started after start of study drug as well as those that were started prior to and 
continued  after  start  of  study  drug).  Glucocorticoids  of  various  classes  were  used  by  patients  in  both 
groups, although more patients in the zoledronic acid group used them as compared with those in the 
placebo group (for example, 61.1% vs 25.0%). 
Adverse events 
The number of patients with AEs, severe AEs, and serious adverse events (SAEs) was slightly higher in 
the  zoledronic  acid  group  than  in  the  placebo  group  (Table  2-3).  The  most  commonly  reported  AEs 
namely gastrointestinal disorders (vomiting, nausea, diarrhea), pyrexia, arthralgia, myalgia, headache 
and  back  pain  were  related  to  post-dose  symptoms.  There  were  no  AEs  related  to  renal  or  skeletal 
system (such as osteonecrosis of jaw, non-union, or delayed union).

The Safety population consisted of all patients that had been exposed to at least one infusion of the 
study drug.  
Primary system organ classes are presented alphabetically. Preferred terms are presented by 
descending frequency in the zoledronic acid group.  
A patient with multiple occurrences of an AE for the same preferred term or system organ class is 
counted only once in each specific category.  
MedDRA version 20.1 is used for reporting.

Deaths and discontinuations as a result of an AE 
No deaths were reported in this study. One patient in the placebo group discontinued study treatment 
as a result of an AE (i.e., fracture).

Serious AEs 
Overall,  more  patients  reported  SAEs  in  the  zoledronic  acid  group  than  in  the  placebo  group  (5 
[27.8%]  patients  vs  1  [6.3%]  patient).  A  total  of  4  (22.2%)  patients  treated  with  zoledronic  acid 
experienced gastrointestinal disorders vs none treated with placebo. 
Other significant adverse events 
Safety topics of interest of hypocalcemia, gastrointestinal AEs and ocular AEs were identified based on 
the  mechanism  of  action  of  zoledronic  acid,  biological  plausibility,  and  information  from  the  existing 
zoledronic  acid  database  in  other  indications.  The  incidence  of  these  AEs  observed  in  this  study  was 
consistent with the known safety profile of Aclasta. 
Two patients in the zoledronic acid group reported newly occurring hypocalcemia events post-baseline, 
based on central laboratory  values and an additional 2 patients reported hypocalcemia events, based 
on AEs and central laboratory calcium. In the 2 patients with hypocalcemia AEs, one patient reported 
the  event  as  an  SAE,  while  the  other  AE  was  considered  mild  in  severity.  Both  of  these  events  were 
suspected to be related to study drug.  
Paediatric safety cumulative data reviews 
The results of Study H2337, which included 34 osteoporotic patients aged 5 to 17 years, did not reveal 
any new safety signals. 
As reported in the Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 01 Sep 2016 to 31 Aug 2017, cumulatively, 
60  cases  of  off  label  use  of  Aclasta  in  paediatric  patients  were  reported.  No  unusual  trend  or  new 
safety  information  was  identified  on  review  of  these  cases.  The  safety  profile  of  zoledronic  acid 
observed  in  this  study  in  paediatric  patients  is  consistent  with  that  in  the  overall  population  in  the 
approved adult indications. 
MAH Discussion on clinical aspects 
The results of this randomized placebo controlled trial evaluating zoledronic acid in 34 children aged 5 
to 17 years with GIO demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in lumbar spine BMD Z-score 
after 12 months of treatment, relative to baseline. This was associated with significant reduction in 
other markers of bone turnover (P1NP, BSAP, NTX) at Month 12, a significant increase in lumbar spine 
BMC at Month 6, and an absence of new vertebral fractures in the zoledronic acid group compared to 
placebo at the end of study, further supporting a positive treatment effect. The overall efficacy and 
safety observed in this study was consistent with the known pharmacology of the drug and experience 
from adult studies with Aclasta. 
Novartis believes that the results of Study H2337 are of clinical relevance and should be reflected in 
the EU SmPC. A type 2 variation to update the labelling is planned pending discussions with concerned 
Health Authorities. Overall, there are no concerns over the benefit/risk of Aclasta (zoledronic acid) in 
paediatric GIO patients based upon the results of Study H2337. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The results of this randomized placebo controlled trial evaluating zoledronic acid in 34 children aged 5 
to 17 years with GIO demonstrated an improvement in bone mineral density, a surrogate for fracture 
outcome. More patients reported SAEs in the zoledronic acid group than in the placebo group. The 
following was described in this study but not specifically mentioned within the current SmPC:

tachycardia, adrenal insufficiency, Crohn’s disease and upper respiratory tract infections. The MAH 
should comment on whether these events are paediatric specific and how they relate to the adult 
safety profile in the upcoming variation procedure.    
The study was terminated after 34 of the planned 92 patients were enrolled due to several recruitment 
challenges over the years. Whether the 34 patients finally recruited in this study, gives sufficient data 
to power the study, evaluate endpoints and the objectives will need to be discussed by the MAH in the 
upcoming variation procedure. 
The MAH is asked to submit the study results together with a proposal for the SmPC and PIL for 
detailed assessment in a type 2 variation. Together with this study, it is recommended that the MAH 
should also submit all available paediatric data regarding zoledronic acid’s use, including any preclinical 
or adult data supporting a potential benefit for the paediatric population. A decision on B/R in 
paediatric population should be based upon all available evidence and not solely this study which may 
have limitations due to underpowering.   
X Fulfilled: 
No further action required, however further data are expected in the context of a variation prior any 
conclusion on product information amendments is made. The MAH should commit to submit this 
variation application no later than 60 days after the receipt of these conclusions.

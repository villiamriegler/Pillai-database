2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This is a MA Application of a generic prasugrel containing product where prasugrel is conjugated to a 
different salt compared to the originator. 
The application for marketing authorisation of Prasugrel Mylan 5mg and 10 mg film-coated tablets is 
submitted under Article 10(1) (generic of a reference medicinal product) of Directive 2001/83/EC as 
amended. The reference product Efient 5mg film-coated tablets and 10mg film-coated tablets (Daiichi 
Sankyo Europe GmbH, Germany), authorised in EU since 25/02/2009 through centralised procedure 
(EU/1/08/503/001-016). 
Prasugrel besilate is an antiplatelet agent, chemically described as 5-[2-cyclopropyl-1-(2-
fluorophenyl)-2-oxoethyl]-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine-2-yl acetate benzenesulfonate.  
Prasugrel is a thienopyridine adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor antagonist that irreversibly 
inhibits the platelet P2Y12 receptor, inhibiting platelet activation and aggregation. The active 
metabolite of Prasugrel is R-138727, a sulfhydryl compound that binds covalently to the P2Y12 
receptor via a disulfide bond similar to clopidogrel active metabolite. It has been suggested that R-
138727 binds to the cysteine residues at positions 97 and 175 of the P2Y12 receptor. Irreversible 
binding of the active metabolite leads to permanent blockade of ADP-mediated P2Y12 receptor 
signaling and the inhibition of glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor activation and platelet aggregation. 
Since platelets participate in the initiation and/or evolution of thrombotic complications of 
atherosclerotic disease, inhibition of platelet function can result in the reduction of the rate of 
cardiovascular events such as death, myocardial infarction, or stroke.  
Prasugrel co-administered with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and is indicated for the prevention of 
atherothrombotic events in adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (i.e. unstable angina, non-
Assessment report  
EMA/243820/2018  
Page 7/32 
 
 
 
 
 
ST segment elevation myocardial infarction [UA/NSTEMI] or ST segment elevation myocardial 
infarction [STEMI]) undergoing primary or delayed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The 
product is a subject to the medical prescription. 
Prasugrel Mylan film-coated tablets are administered orally with or without food. The tablets are not 
to be crushed or broken. The proposed drug product package is the high-density polyethylene (HDPE) 
bottles with child-resistant polypropylene (PP) closures with desiccant, containing 28 film-coated 
tablets per bottle. 
The recommended starting dose of Prasugrel is 60mg and then treatment is continued with 10mg 
once a day. Patients taking Prasugrel should also take ASA daily (75 mg to 325mg). 
The main identified safety concerns are bleeding, thrombocytopenia, hypersensitivity including 
angioedema and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as immediate release film-coated tablets containing 5 or 10 mg of 
prasugrel as the active substance.

Figure 1. Structure of prasugrel 
The structure of the active substance was elucidated by a combination of elementary analysis, 
infrared spectroscopy (IR), ultraviolet (UV), NMR (1H and 13C), mass spectrometry (MS) and X-Ray 
Powder Diffraction (XRPD). Prasugrel is sufficiently characterised and its structure is adequately 
elucidated.  
Prasugrel besilate appears as a white to light brown colour, hygroscopic crystalline powder. 
Prasugrel is soluble in methanol, slightly soluble in acetone and practically insoluble in water. The 
active substance is a racemic mixture. 
Prasugrel besilate is a crystalline form. The active substance is known to exhibit polymorphism. The 
polymorphic form is adequately controlled by PXRD identification test as part of the active substance 
specification for release and stability. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the 
restricted part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
The synthesis of prasugrel besilate comprises numerous steps of chemical synthesis following 
purification and salt formation stages. The choice of the starting material has been justified; they 
are well defined and sufficiently controlled by acceptable specifications. A satisfactory discussion of 
the synthesis of the proposed starting materials, including the used reagents, catalysts and solvents 
has been provided together with a discussion about possible impurities and their carry-over into the 
final active substance.  
Final active substance batches are micronised using clean compressed nitrogen in order to achieve 
the desired particle size.  
Critical and non-critical process steps and parameters have been identified and adequate in-process 
controls are applied during the synthesis of the active substance. The control strategy ensures 
consistent quality of the active substance. The characterisation of the active substance and its 
impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new active substances.  
The potential impurities are controlled in the active substance and intermediate specifications as 
well as in the in-process control during the manufacturing of the active substance by validated test 
methods. It has been demonstrated that the impurities are generally adequately controlled during 
manufacturing of the active substance. The proposed tests and acceptance criteria for prasugrel 
active substance, intermediate and in process controls are considered acceptable and justified. 
Prasugrel is packed in HMLDPE bag and sealed under nitrogen. It is then inserted in triple laminated 
aluminium bag with silica gel sachets and molecular sieve and sealed under nitrogen. Both these 
bags are then put into outer bag of triple laminated aluminium bag, with silica gel sachets and more 
molecular sieve and sealed under nitrogen. These bags are further packed in HDPE drums, closed 
with plastic lids having rubber gasket followed by locking ring and a metal seal. The polyethylene 
bags used as primary packaging material are food grade and comply with the requirements of Ph. 
Eur. and European Directive 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes appropriate tests and limits for appearance (visual), 
Assessment report  
EMA/243820/2018  
Page 9/32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
solubility, identification (IR, HPLC, PXRD), water content (KF), sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.), heavy metals 
(Ph. Eur.), related substances (HPLC), assay (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), mesityl oxide (by GC), 
benzene sulfonic acid content (potentiometry), methyl benzenesulfonate content (GC-MS) and 
particle size distribution (DLS). 
The potential impurities are controlled in the final active substance by validated test methods. As 
the results are either below detection limit or not detected, it has been demonstrated that the 
impurities are generally adequately controlled during manufacturing of the active substance. Based 
on the data provided, the fate and carry-over and fate of above impurities have been sufficiently 
demonstrated. 
The specifications, which include relevant physical and chemical parameters to assure the quality of 
the active substance and are in accordance to the corresponding guidelines, are acceptable and 
adequately justified.  
The analytical procedures used in the control of the active substance have generally been 
satisfactorily described and validated in accordance with the relevant ICH guidelines. Information 
regarding the reference standards used in the analytical testing is satisfactory. 
Batch analysis data for six batches were provided. The results are within the specifications and 
confirm consistency of the manufacturing process from batch to batch.  
Stability 
Stability data on three production scale batches of prasugrel besilate active substance stored in the 
intended commercial packaging for up to 18 months under long term conditions (25 °C / 60 % RH) 
and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 °C / 75 % RH) was provided according to 
the ICH guidelines.  
Additional stability data on three production scale batches of prasugrel besilate active substance 
stored in the intended commercial packaging for up to 18 months under long term conditions (5° ± 
3°C) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (25 °C, 60 % RH) was provided according 
to the ICH guidelines.  
Samples were tested for identification, assay, related substances and water content. The test 
methods are stability indicating. No significant changes to any of the measured parameters were 
observed under long term and accelerated conditions and all remained within specification. 
Stress testing (heat, acid and base exposure and oxidation) was also performed. Rapid degradation 
was observed when prasugrel besilate sample were exposed to basic conditions at room 
temperature. Significant degradation was observed when prasugrel besilate sample were exposed to 
acidic conditions and peroxide at room temperature, heat and light. The substance is proven to be 
light sensitive and slightly hygroscopic. No significant degradation was observed when prasugrel 
besilate samples exposed to humidity at 90% RH. 
The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months in the proposed container.

2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a yellow film-coated, capsule shaped, biconvex tablet, debossed with ‘PH3’ 
on one side and ‘M’ on the other side containing 5 of prasugrel, or beige, film-coated, capsule 
shaped, biconvex tablet debossed with ‘PH4’ on one side of the tablet and ‘M’ on the other side 
containing 10 mg of Prasugrel. 
The aim of the pharmaceutical development work was to develop a generic medicinal product of the 
reference product, Efient; i.e.  an immediate release oral dosage form, which contains 5 mg and 10 
mg of prasugrel besilate as active substance presented in the form of film coated tablets and 
bioequivalent to the reference medicinal product. 
Prasugrel besilate is a white to light brown colour, hygroscopic, very fine and crystalline powder. It 
has good flow property. The active substance belongs to BCS Class II, it is practically insoluble. It is 
a racemic mixture known to exhibit polymorphism. The polymorphic form is adequately remains 
unchanged in the finished product at release and during shelf life. 
The besilate salt of prasugrel is used in the composition as an active substance, whereas the 
reference product uses the hydrochloride salt. In terms of physicochemical properties, the besilate 
salt does not differ significantly from the hydrochloride salt.  
The in-vitro dissolution data demonstrated the equivalent dissolution profiles for the approved 
hydrochloride salt and the proposed besilate salt formulations. Prasugrel base was formulated as the 
hydrochloride salt in reference product in order to enhance exposure to the active metabolite. In the 
current application, an alternate salt form (prasugrel besilate) has been utilized for the same 
purposes. Hence, the active moiety (prasugrel) is unchanged and unaffected by the choice of salt. 
Taking into account the low solubility of prasugrel besilate, particle size is considered as critical 
parameter on performance of the finished product. The effect of particle size distribution (PSD) of 
active substance on tablet characteristics and dissolution was evaluated. Physical parameters were 
found to be satisfactory and drug release comparable to reference product in the formulations with 
difference in particle size of active substance. The test product and the reference product exhibit 
similar physical characteristics, assay and impurity profile. 
All excipients are well-known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards, except film coating material (Opadry). The individual components used in the 
manufacturing of Opadry coating materials comply with the monograph in Ph. Eur. 
There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. The choice and function of 
the excipients in the formulation has been justified. 
The compatibility of prasugrel besilate with the excipients is demonstrated by stability studies. The 
samples were evaluated for any change in the physical characteristics and related substances at 
initial time and after one-month exposure. As no significant changes in the physical appearance and 
in level of total impurities were observed, prasugrel besilate is regarded compatible with all the 
selected excipients. 
An in vivo bioequivalence study between the 10 mg film coated tablets reference product and the 
generic product has been performed. A comparative in vitro dissolution study of the generic 
Assessment report  
EMA/243820/2018  
Page 11/32 
 
 
 
 
 
medicinal product formulation and the reference product at four representative physiological pH 
buffers (0.1 N HCl, QC test medium, pH 4.5 Acetate buffer and pH 6.8 Phosphate buffer) has been 
performed. The dissolution profiles can be considered similar in all four dissolution media.  
Additionally, to support the request for a biowaiver for the 5 mg dosage strength a justification and 
results of comparative dissolution tests have been provided. As all criteria for a biowaiver according 
to the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence were fulfilled, the biowaiver was granted for 
5 mg strength. 
Based on the results of dissolution method development studies, the proposed QC dissolution 
method is considered sufficiently justified. Sink conditions were met and operating conditions are 
suitable. The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been adequately demonstrated by 
comparing batches manufactured with slight changes to the formulation and different manufacturing 
process parameters.  
Regarding the manufacturing process development, direct compression technology has been chosen 
using free flowing directly compressible excipients in formulation. This approach has been 
considered because of prasugrel besilate active substance sensitivity towards moisture, the low 
doses and its good flow property. The manufacturing process follows a conventional approach for 
solid dosages forms, employing widely used manufacturing equipment.  
The container closure system of the finished product is a High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) bottle 
pack with white opaque polypropylene screw cap with aluminium induction sealing liner wad and a 
desiccant (2 g canister) is included in the container (as loose) along with the tablets. The material 
complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been 
validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process for the finished product comprises the following main steps:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
sifting  
blending  
lubrication  
compression  
film coating  
packaging 
The manufacturing process is considered a standard process and it has been described satisfactorily. 
The critical steps of the manufacturing process were defined as blending, compression, film-coating 
and packaging. The in-process controls (IPCs) during the manufacturing process have been 
presented and are adequately justified. The control strategy ensures that the manufacturing process 
consistently delivers a product that meets the defined criteria for all release specifications. 
Holding time studies were successfully finalized for lubricated blend, tablet cores and film coated 
tablets and based on the review of the results a cumulative holding time was established. 
The manufacturing process has been validated on three commercial batches. Process validation data 
complies with set acceptance criteria. 
Assessment report  
EMA/243820/2018  
Page 12/32 
 
 
 
 
 
In conclusion, it has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is sufficiently robust to 
provide assurance that tablets of consistent quality, complying with the designated specification, are 
produced. 
Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests and limits for this 
type of dosage form: description (visual), identification of prasugrel (HPLC, PDA), dissolution 
(HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), water (KF) 
and microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and validated in accordance with the 
relevant ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used in the 
routine analysis of finished product has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from 3 pilot scale batches have been presented for both strengths. All data is 
within specification. The results show that the finished product can be manufactured with consistent 
quality and meeting its specifications. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of three pilot scale batches for both strengths of finished product stored under long 
term conditions for up to 12 months (25 °C / 60% RH), for up to 12 months under intermediate 
conditions (30 °C / 65% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 °C/ 75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The stability batches were packed in the primary 
packaging proposed for marketing.  
The following stability-indicating parameters have been investigated: description, dissolution, assay, 
related substances, water and microbiological quality. The methods used were the same as for 
release testing and are stability indicating.  
The stability study results indicate that the 5 mg strength product complies with the proposed 
finished product shelf life specifications at long term and intermediate storage conditions and that 
the 10 mg strength product complies with the proposed finished product shelf life specifications at 
long term storage conditions.  
Non-compliant results were observed at accelerated storage conditions for the 5 mg strength and at 
accelerated and intermediate storage condition for the 10 mg strength product. The results of assay 
test failed to meet the specification limits for both strengths stored under accelerated conditions and 
there was a discrepancy in the mass balance of the assay  and impurities results for the 10 mg  
product at accelerated conditions and at intermediate conditions. The validated HPLC methods for 
determination of the assay and detecting the impurities have been demonstrated to be reliable and 
stability indicating. 
A photostability study has been performed on one commercial scale batch of Prasugrel film-coated 
tablets according to ICH Q1B Guideline. The following parameters were tested: description, assay, 
dissolution, water (KF) and degradation products. The obtained stability results indicated that there 
are no out of specification results and thus, it can be concluded that Prasugrel film-coated tablets 
are not photosensitive. 
Forced degradation study under acid, alkali, peroxide, thermal, photolytic and humidity conditions

was carried out on the finished product in order to demonstrate the stability indicating nature of the 
assay and related substances methods. The results of degradation studies demonstrate that the 
validated HPLC method is suitable for the determination of all degradants in prasugrel preparation.  
Based on the provided stability data, the proposed shelf life of 15 months stored not above 30ºC for 
prasugrel 5 mg tablets and shelf life of 12 months stored not above 25ºC for prasugrel 10 mg 
tablets, both in the original package in order to protect from moisture, as stated in the SmPC 
(sections 6.3 and 6.4) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used 
2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product 
has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency 
and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion 
that from a quality perspective the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in 
clinical use. 
2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the 
conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform 
clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6. Recommendations for future quality development 
None. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, 
which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. A summary of the literature with 
regard to non-clinical data and justifications that the different salt (prasugrel besilate) of the active 
substance does not differ significantly in properties with regards to safety and efficacy of the 
reference product (prasugrel hydrochloride) were provided and were considered accepted by 
assessor. This is in accordance with the relevant guideline and additional non clinical studies were 
not considered necessary. The overview justifies why there is no need to generate additional non-
clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC 
are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been discussed and was 
considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.

2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of prasugrel besilate manufactured by Mylan Laboratories is considered unlikely to 
result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all prasugrel containing products 
and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be 
similar and not increased. 
2.3.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
A summary of the literature with regard to non-clinical data of Prasugrel Mylan and justifications 
that the different salt of the active substance does not differ significantly in properties with regards 
to safety and efficacy of the reference product was provided and was accepted by the CHMP. This is 
in accordance with the relevant guideline and additional non clinical studies were not considered 
necessary. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for film coated tablets containing prasugrel besylate. To support the marketing 
authorisation application the applicant conducted 2 bioequivalence studies with cross-over design 
under fasting and fed conditions. This study was the pivotal study for the assessment. 
Relevant guidance documents for this assessment are the Guideline on the Investigation of 
Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98) as well as the Guideline on Bioanalytical method 
validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/09).   
The applicant did not seek CHMP Scientific Advice pertinent to the clinical investigation.  
Reference product is Efient 5 mg & 10 mg (Prasugrel) film-coated tablets registered by Daiichi 
Sankyo Europe GmbH (formely of Eli Lilly Nederland BV, The Netherlands). The community granted 
marketing authorisation of the reference product Efient 5 mg and 10 mg film-coated tablets on 
23/02/2009 under number EMEA/H/C/000984. The applicant has developed Prasugrel film-coated 
tablets generic to the medicinal product Efient 5 mg and 10 mg film-coated tablets. The composition 
of the proposed and reference product can be considered essentially similar except for the salt form 
of the drug substance: Prasugrel hydrochloride (Efient) vs Prasugrel besilate (Prasugrel Mylan).  
Prasugrel is co-administered with salicylic acid (ASA) and is indicated for the prevention of 
atherothrombotic events in adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (i.e. unstable angina, non-
ST segment elevation myocardial infarction [UA/NSTEMI] or ST segment elevation myocardial 
infarction [STEMI]) undergoing primary or delayed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
Assessment report

The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Exemption  
Two  bioequivalence  studies  have  been  conducted  on  the  10  mg  strength  under  fed  and  fasting 
conditions.  To  fulfil  the  requirements  of  a  biowaiver  for  lower  strength,  5  mg  film-coated  tablets, 
dissolution testing was performed and extended the in-vivo performance of 10 mg strength to 5 mg 
strength.  
As  described  by  clinical  expert,  the  waiver  was  considered  justified,  since  the  following  general 
biowaiver requirements were met: 
a)  Both the strengths of Prasugrel film-coated tablets (5 mg and 10 mg) are manufactured by the 
same manufacturer at the same manufacturing site using same manufacturing process. 
b)  The  excipients  included  in  the  composition  of  the  formulation  are  well  established  and  no 
interaction with the pharmacokinetics of the active substance is expected. 
c)  The qualitative composition of both the strengths is the same. Both strengths are direct scale 
up/scale  down  formulations  and  the  ratio  between  the  amounts  of  each  excipient  to  the 
amount of the active substance is the same for both the strengths (see Table 1). 
d)  Both the strengths exhibit similar in-vitro performance. The dissolution profiles are similar. 
e)  The absorption kinetics of Prasugrel is linear within the therapeutic dose range.  
Comparative  dissolution  profile  study  results  for  Prasugrel  film-coated  10  mg  tablet  (Bio-batch  No. 
2012095)  versus  Prasugrel  film-coated  5  mg  tablet  at  pH  1.0,  4.5,  6.8  and  QC  test  medium  were 
presented and shown to be similar by means of f2 comparison.

2017. 
Population(s) studied 
A  total  of  48  healthy  male  subjects  (Asian  race,  aged  21  –  43  years,  BMI  19.01  –  29.90)  were 
included in the study. Only non-smokers were allowed in this study.  
47  subjects  completed  both  study  phases  and  were  included  in  the  pharmacokinetic  and  statistical 
analysis. No major protocol deviations were reported. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were presented 
and were acceptable for a BE study and for the product under investigation. 
Drop outs: Subject No. 18 dropped out due to adverse events (Headache) in period one.  
Analytical methods 
Plasma  concentrations  of  Prasugrel  inactive  metabolite  R-95913  were  determined  using  a  validated 
reversed  phase  LC-MS/MS  method  over  a  concentration  range  of  0.998  to  151.749  ng/ml.  Study 
drugs  were  extracted  from  200  µl  of  plasma  using  solid  phase  extraction.  2-oxo  Prasugrel  D4  (R-
95913-D4) was used as internal standards.  
Blood  samples  were  collected  into  K3EDTA  tubes  and  centrifuged.  The  plasma  samples  were  frozen 
and retained at -70°C until assay. The bioanalyses were carried out between Mar 02, 2017 and Mar 
22, 2017. 
9  non-zero  calibrates  and  4  levels  of  QC  samples  were  used.  The  calibration  curve  range  covered 
0.998 to 151.749 ng/mL for Prasugrel metabolite R-95913. LOQ was 0.998 ng/ml. The quality control 
(QC) concentrations were 3.009 (low), 20.195 (medium 1), 76.740 (medium 2) and 113.090 (high) 
ng/mL for study sample analysis.   
The  linear  calibration  curve  calculated  by  weighted  linear  regression  (weight  =  1/x2)  was  used  for 
calculation of sample concentration. 
Pre-study  validation  and  bio-analytical  report  are  presented.  The  method  selectivity  and  sensitivity 
were  demonstrated.  Stability  of  analytes  at  various  conditions  during  storage,  sample  preparation 
and  analysis  was  shown  according to the  requirements  for  bio-analytical  method  validation.  Dilution 
integrity, carryover and matrix effect were tested. Composition of analytical runs has been described.  
Incurred  sample  reanalysis  was  conducted  on  160  samples  (8.3  %  of  1898  samples).  98.75% 
(158/160) of concentrations obtained by reanalysis were found within 20% of their mean initial value. 
The  maximum  study  sample  storage  period  from  first  blood  draw  (Feb  16,  2017)  to  last  sample 
analysis  (Mar  22,  2017)  was  35  days  for  Prasugrel  metabolite.  The  long-term  stability  of  Prasugrel 
inactive metabolite (R-95913) in human plasma in presence of Prasugrel active metabolite (R-138727 
Prasugrel metabolite R-95913 covers 54 days at -70°C.

All concentration values below limit of quantification were set as zero for PK analysis. 
Reanalysis  of  study  samples:  A  total  of  1898  study  samples  were  received  and  analysed  in  27 
analytical  runs.  Twenty-one  (21  i.e.  1.11%)  samples  were  re-assayed  for  analytical  reasons  (bad 
chromatography, sample concentration above ULOQ, unacceptable IS response).  
Pharmacokinetic variables 
Primary variables were Cmax and AUC0-t. 
The following pharmacokinetic parameters for Prasugrel metabolites R-95913 were determined: Cmax, 
tmax, AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, AUC0-t/AUC0-∞ %, Kel and t1/2.  
Statistical methods 
Pharmacokinetic  and  statistical  analyses  were  performed  using  Phoenix  WinNonlin  version  6.3  and 
SAS version 9.2 software. 
PK  parameters  for  each  individual  were  tabulated  and  graphically  presented.  Individual  AUC 
parameters  were  calculated  using  the  linear  trapezoidal  rule.  ANOVA  was  performed  on  the  ln-
transformed  Cmax,  AUC0-t  and  AUC0-∞.  Non-parametric  analysis  of  tmax  was  performed  on 
untransformed  data.  ANOVA  model  included  Sequence,  Formulation,  Period  and  Subject  (Sequence) 
as fixed effects.  
Criteria for conclusion of bioequivalence: 
The  90%  confidence  intervals  for  the  difference  of  means  of  ln-transformed  pharmacokinetic 
parameters Cmax and AUC0-t for Prasugrel inactive metabolite R-95913 were within 80.00 to 125.00% 
to conclude the test product was bioequivalent to the reference product under fasting conditions.

Population(s) studied   
A total of 48 healthy non-smoking male and female subjects (an Asian, white or black race; aged 19 
– 61 years; BMI 19.1 – 30.4) were included in the study.  
42 subjects completed all study phases. All subjects who completed at least two periods of the study 
were  analysed.  44  subjects  were  included  in  the  pharmacokinetic  and  statistical  analysis.  Inclusion 
and exclusion criteria has been presented and is adequate for a BE study and for the product under 
investigation. As assessed by the PI, none of the protocol deviations had an impact on data integrity 
or conclusions of this study. 
Drop  outs:  Subject  No.  38  did  not  report  to  clinic  for  Period  2  dosing.  Subject  No.  33  (Period  3), 
No.39  (Period  1),  No.42  (Period  2)  and  No.48  (Period  1)  were  discontinued  due  to  out  of  range 
hemoglobin/hematocrit  value  as  specified  by  protocol.  Subject  No.40  was  discontinued  due  to  an 
adverse event (rash) prior to Period 2 dosing. 
Analytical methods  
Plasma  concentrations  of  Prasugrel  inactive  metabolite  R-95913  were  determined  using  a  validated 
reversed  phase  LC-MS/MS  method  over  a  concentration  range  of  1.00  to  300  ng/mL.  Study  drugs 
were extracted from 200 µl of plasma fortified with ascorbic acid using solid phase extraction. 2-oxo 
Prasugrel D4 (R-95913-D4) was used as internal standards.  
Blood  samples  were  collected  into  K2EDTA  tubes  and  centrifuged.  The  plasma  samples  were  frozen 
and retained at -70°C until assay. The bioanalyses were carried out between Nov 28, 2017 to Dec 07, 
2017. 
8  non-zero  calibrates  and  4  levels  of  QC  samples  were  used.  LOQ  was  1.00  ng/mL.  The  quality 
control  (QC)  concentrations  were  3.00  (low),  18.00  (medium  1),  50.00  (medium  2)  and  230.00 
(high) ng/mL for study sample analysis.

The  linear  calibration  curve  calculated  by  weighted  linear  regression  (weight  =  1/x2)  was  used  for 
calculation of sample concentration. 
Pre-study  validation  and  bio-analytical  report  are  presented.  The  method  selectivity  and  sensitivity 
were  demonstrated.  Stability  of  analytes  at  various  conditions  during  storage,  sample  preparation 
and  analysis  was  shown  according to the  requirements  for  bio-analytical  method  validation.  Dilution 
integrity, carryover and matrix effect were tested. Composition of analytical runs has been described.  
Incurred  sample  reanalysis  was  conducted  on  289  samples  (8.7  %  of  3305  samples).  98.60% 
(285/289) of concentrations obtained by reanalysis were found within 20% of their mean initial value. 
The  maximum  study  sample  storage  period  from  first  blood  draw  (Oct  28,  2017)  to  last  sample 
analysis  (Dec  07,  2017)  was  40  days  for  Prasugrel  metabolite.  The  long-term  stability  of  Prasugrel 
inactive metabolite (R-95913) in human plasma covers 40 days at -70°C.  
All concentration values below limit of quantification were set as zero for PK analysis. 
Reanalysis  of  study  samples:  A  total  of  3305  study  samples  were  received  and  analysed  in  66 
analytical  runs.  Eight  (8  i.e.  0.24%)  samples  were  re-assayed  for  analytical  reasons  (sample 
processing error, abnormal IS response).  Eight runs, subjects 1 through 8, were re-assayed due to 
being outside the batch acceptance criteria. 
Statistical methods   
Statistical  analyses  were  performed  on  the  pharmacokinetic  parameters  using  the  General  Linear 
Models Procedure (PROC GLM) of SAS Software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).  
PK  parameters  for  R-95913,  the  inactive  metabolite  of  Prasugrel,  were  calculated  using  non-
compartmental  techniques.  PK  parameters  for  each  individual  were  tabulated  and  graphically 
presented.  Individual  AUC  parameters  were  calculated  using  the  linear  trapezoidal  rule.  ANOVA  was 
performed  on  the  ln-transformed  Cmax,  AUC0-t  and  AUC0-∞.  Non-parametric  analysis  of  tmax  was 
performed on untransformed data. ANOVA model included Sequence, Formulation, Period and Subject 
(Sequence) as fixed effects.  
Criteria for conclusion of bioequivalence: 
The  90%  geometric  confidence  intervals  of  the  ratio  (T/R  or  A/B)  of  least-squares  means  from  the 
ANOVA  of  the  natural  log transformed  AUC0-t  and  Cmax  should be  within  80.00%  to  125.00%.  If  the 
intra-subject  variability  for  Cmax  was  greater  than  or  equal  to  30%  for  the  reference  product, 
bioequivalence criteria for Cmax using the scaled bioequivalence method will be utilized. 
Pharmacokinetic variables  
Primary variables were Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ for Prasugrel metabolite, R-95913.  
The following pharmacokinetic parameters for Prasugrel metabolites R-95913 were determined: Cmax, 
tmax, AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, AUC0-t/AUC0-∞ %, Kel and t1/2.

2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
To  support  the  application,  the  applicant  has  submitted    a  open-label,  laboratory-blinded, 
randomized, single dose, two-period, two-treatment cross-over bioequivalence study in healthy male 
subjects under fasting conditions to demonstrate essential similarity with the reference product Efient 
(by  Eli  Lilly  Nederland  BV,  The  Netherlands).  According  to  the  SmPC  of  reference  product,  the 
pharmacokinetics  of  Prasugrel  metabolites  appears  linear  over  the  therapeutic  dosage  range  and 
prasugrel can be taken without regard to food. Therefore, the selection of the highest dose, 10 mg, 
used in the bioequivalence study is justified and in accordance to guidelines.  
Prasugrel  Mylan  contains  besilate  as  the  salt  form  of  the  drug  substance  which  differs  from  the 
originator  Efient  (prasugrel  hydrochloride).  As  per  increasing  scientific  knowledge,  different  salts  of 
prasugrel may have different and pH dependent solubility. Therefore, additional data were asked from 
the applicant to demonstrate that the in vivo bioavailability of Prasugrel Mylan is not affected by the 
change in gastric pH induced by the concomitant food intake or concomitant medications, which may 
increase gastric pH.  
Together with the Day 180 responses applicant submitted the results of an additional bioequivalence 
study under the fed conditions to demonstrate that the possible increase of the gastric pH due to the 
concomitant food intake does not affect the in vivo bioavailability of Prasugrel tablets.  
Prasugrel is a prodrug that requires enzymatic transformation in the liver to its active metabolite, R-
138727. Prasugrel is not detected in plasma following oral administration. It is rapidly hydrolysed in 
the  intestine  to  thiolactone  (R-95913)  by  human  carboxylesterase.  This  intermediate  is  further 
metabolized to its active metabolite (R-138727) in a single step by cytochrome P450 enzymes in the 
liver.  Thus,  Prasugrel  metabolite  R-95913  is  considered  as  parent  compound  and  is  used  as  main 
surrogate for demonstrating the BE for Prasugrel, which is considered acceptable. 
Additionally,  the  applicant  has  requested  biowaiver  for  the  5  mg  dosage  strength.  To  support  the 
request, a justification and results of comparative dissolution tests have been provided. The in vitro 
dissolution  tests  complimentary  to  the  bioequivalence  study  comparing  the  test  and  the  reference 
bio-batches over physiological pH range were conducted on 12 units at rotation speed 50 rpm.  
Comparative  dissolution  profiles  demonstrated  that  the  bio-batch  and  additional  strength  were 
essentially similar over the physiological pH range. The Applicant has also performed the comparative 
dissolution  study  between  test  products  and  reference  product  for  both  strengths  including  bio-
batches. The dissolution profiles from these experiments demonstrate similarity between test product 
and reference formulation in 0.1 N HCl, as more than 85% of drug is released within 15 minutes. The 
calculated f2 values between formulations and strengths tested at the QC test medium and at pH 4.5 
and 6.8, were found to be greater than 50. As all criteria for a biowaiver according to the Guideline 
on the Investigation of Bioequivalence were fulfilled, the biowaiver can be granted for 5 mg strength.  
Fasting conditions (Study No. C15229) 
The BE study was conducted under standardised conditions. The sampling period was sufficient, the 
sampling  time  schedule  and  wash-out  period  were  adequate  taking  into  account  the  Tmax  and 
elimination  half-life  of  the  Prasugrel  active  metabolite  (R-138727).  The  extrapolated  AUC  was  less 
than 20% for all, except one, subject indicating that the duration of sampling was sufficient. 
Data regarding the test and reference product were sufficient. 
The  population  was  chosen  according  to  the  guidelines.  Bioanalytical  method  had  satisfactory 
performance  and  was  adequately  validated.  The  pharmacokinetic  and  statistical  methods  applied 
were  appropriate  for  a  single  dose  study.  The  90%  confidence  intervals  for  ln-transformed 
Assessment report

pharmacokinetic  variables  Cmax  and  AUC0-t  were  within  the  conventional  bioequivalence  range  of 
80.00% to 125.00%. 
The pharmacokinetic variables for Prasugrel metabolites R-95913 were comparable between test and 
reference product. Both formulations were well tolerated in the study.  
Fed conditions (Study No. PRAS-17037) 
GCP and GLP statements are provided however further information is needed regarding the outcome 
of the inspections performed by the competent authorities at the clinical and analytical study sites. 
The  Applicant  has  expected  higher  intra-subject  variability  for  Cmax  therefore  a  study  was  designed 
accordingly  and  four-period  replicate  cross-over  study  was  carried  out.  Overall  study  design  was 
acceptable  and  in  line  with  pharmacokinetic  properties  of  Prasugrel.  Prasugrel  intermediate 
metabolite  R-95913  was  used  as  main  surrogate  for  demonstrating  the  BE  for  Prasugrel,  which  is 
acceptable. 
The BE study  was conducted under standardised conditions. The composition of the meals has been 
described  as  indicated  in  the  EMA  BE  guideline.  The  sampling  period  was  sufficient  and  wash-out 
period  was  adequate  taking  into  account  the  elimination  half-life  of  Prasugrel  active  metabolite  (R-
138727).  The  extrapolated  AUC  was  less  than  20%  for  all  subjects  indicating  that  the  duration  of 
sampling  was  sufficient.  First-point  Cmax  occurred  in  11  subjects  (overall  in  15  profiles),  as  some 
occurrences were on both periods of dosing for the test product. Only 8 profiles (~9%) for 4 subjects 
consistently demonstrated first-point Cmax. The recalculation of BE parameters excluding all subjects 
with  first  time  point  Cmax  or  only  profiles  with  first  time  point  Cmax  did  not  change  the  initial  BE 
conclusion as the 90% CIs of ratios for Cmax and  AUCs remained within 80-125% acceptance limits. 
Thus, the sampling frequency could be considered sufficient. 
Overall, the data provided on the test and reference product can be considered sufficient. 
The  population  was  chosen  according  to  the  guidelines.  Bioanalytical  method  had  satisfactory 
performance  and  was  adequately  validated.  The  pharmacokinetic  and  statistical  methods  applied 
were  appropriate  for  a  single  dose  study.  The  90%  confidence  intervals  for  ln-transformed 
pharmacokinetic  variables  Cmax  and  AUC0-t  were  within  the  conventional  bioequivalence  range  of 
80.00% to 125.00%. 
The pharmacokinetic variables for Prasugrel metabolites R-95913 were comparable between test 
and reference product. Both formulations were well tolerated in the study under fed conditions. 
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
In conclusion, based on submitted bioequivalence studies, the Prasugrel Mylan 5 mg and 10 mg 
film-coated tablets by Mylan Laboratories Limited, India could be considered bioequivalent with 
Efient 5 mg and 10 mg film-coated tablets by Eli Lilly Nederland BV, The Netherlands (MAH: Daiichi 
Sankyo Europe GmbH, Germany).

the basis of a bridging report making reference to Efient. The bridging report submitted by the 
applicant has been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of prasugrel film-coated tablets. The reference product 
Efient, co-administered with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is indicated for the prevention of 
atherothrombotic events in adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (i.e. unstable angina, non-
ST segment elevation myocardial infarction [UA/NSTEMI] or ST segment elevation myocardial 
infarction [STEMI]) undergoing primary or delayed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). No 
nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the 
available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient.  
From a clinical perspective, this application does contain new data on the pharmacokinetics. 
Two bioequivalence studies were provided and form the pivotal basis for approval: (1) A 
randomized, open-label, balanced, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence, single-dose, crossover 
oral bioequivalence study of Prasugrel Mylan film-coated tablets 10 mg, with Efient (prasugrel 
hydrochloride) film-coated tablets 10 mg in normal healthy adult human subjects under fasting 
conditions and (2) A single-dose, randomized, four-period, two-treatment, replicate design, 
crossover study investigating the bioequivalence of Prasugrel Mylan film-coated tablets and Efient 
film-coated tablets,  following administration of a single, oral dose of 10 mg to healthy  adult 
subjects under fed conditions. 
The studies design was considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation and 
was in line with the respective European requirements. Choice of dose, sampling points, overall 
sampling time as well as wash-out period was adequate. The analytical method was validated. 
Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. 
The test formulation of Prasugrel Mylan met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when 
compared with the Efient under fed and fasting conditions. The point estimates and their 90% 
confidence intervals for the parameters AUC0-t,, AUC0-∞, and Cmax were all contained within the 
protocol-defined acceptance range of [range, e.g. 80.00 to 125.00%]. Hence, the bioequivalence of 
the two formulations was demonstrated. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen 
reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are 
required beyond those included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Prasugrel Mylan is favourable in the following indication: 
Prasugrel Mylan, co administered with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is indicated for the prevention of 
atherothrombotic events in adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (i.e. unstable angina, non-
ST segment elevation myocardial infarction [UA/NSTEMI] or ST segment elevation myocardial 
infarction [STEMI]) undergoing primary or delayed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

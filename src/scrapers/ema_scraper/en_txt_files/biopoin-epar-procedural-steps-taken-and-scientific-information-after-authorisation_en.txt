system - which has not been assessed by the 
relevant NCA/EMA for another product of the same 
MAH 
used by TEVA Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., which will be 
applied for the product Biopoin.  The detailed description of 
this pharmacovigilance system includes information 
pertaining to the qualified person responsible for 
pharmacovigilance, the global structure of the 
pharmacovigilance organisation, company procedures 
relating to pharmacovigilance activities, global safety 
databases, links with other organisations, training and the

A patient-level data analysis has also been performed on 
more than 13,900 cancer patients (chemo-, radio-

chemotherapy, the overall survival hazard ratio was 1.04 
(95% CI: 0.97, 1.11; 38 trials and 10,441 patients). Meta-
analyses also indicate consistently a significantly increased 
relative risk of thromboembolic events in cancer patients 
receiving recombinant human erythropoietin (see section 
4.4). 
To update Section 4.4 "Special Warnings and Precautions of 
Use" of the SmPC with the following wording: 
A paradoxical decrease in haemoglobin and development of 
severe anaemia associated with low reticulocyte counts 
should prompt to discontinue treatment with epoetin and 
perform anti-erythropoietin antibody testing. Cases have 
been reported in patients with hepatitis C treated with 
interferon and ribavirin, when epoetins are used 
concomitantly. Epoetins are not approved in the 
management of anaemia associated with hepatitis C.

Update of section 4.5 of the SmPC to add new 
information about the drug-drug interactions

Tybost and Stribild) and corticosteroids, based on 
post-marketing data. Furthermore, the MAH took the 
opportunity to bring the Tybost Product Information 
in line with version 10.2 of the QRD template and 
update the list of local representatives. Moreover, 
minor editorial updates and corrections have been

For coadministration of cutaneously-administered 
corticosteroids sensitive to CYP3A inhibition, the treating 
physician should refer to the prescribing information of the 
corticosteroid for conditions or uses that augment its 
systemic absorption.

The marketing authorisation holder presented results from 
to add information regarding drug-drug interactions 
between cobicistat -containing products and 
thienopyridines and potential for lower exposures of 
active metabolites of drugs that rely on CYP3A for 
transformation of prodrug to active metabolite. The 
proposed addition is based on a cumulative safety 
review conducted by MAH and related to the 
Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee 
recommendation dated June 2019 with regards to 
the interaction of clopidogrel with boosted antiviral 
HIV therapy leading to insufficient inhibition of 
platelet aggregation. The section 2 of the Package 
Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
a cumulative safety review following the Pharmacovigilance 
Risk Assessment Committee recommendation dated June 
2019 with regards to the interaction of clopidogrel with 
boosted antiviral HIV therapy leading to insufficient

product information has been updated to highlight the 
drug-drug interactions between cobicistat-containing

In addition, the MAH took also the opportunity to

aluminium lake (E110) per tablet in section 2 of the 
SmPC following the suggestion done by EMA 
Labelling group during the renewal application 
(EMEA/H/C/002572/R/0041). Moreover, the sodium 
excipient wording is added in accordance with the 
“Excipients in the labelling and package leaflet of 
medicinal products for human use” (SANTE-2017-
11668). Finally, the PI is brought in line with the 
latest QRD template.

The results from a prospective study (IMPAACT P1026s)

showed that treatment with cobicistat and elvitegravir-
containing regimens during pregnancy results in lower 
elvitegravir and cobicistat exposures. Cobicistat levels

decrease and may not provide sufficient boosting.  The 
substantial reduction in elvitegravir and darunavir exposure 
may result in virological failure and an increased risk of 
mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection.  Based on 
this, the product information for Genvoya, Stribild and 
Tybost have been updated to recommend that therapy with 
these therapies should not be initiated during pregnancy, 
and women who become pregnant during therapy should 
be switched to an alternative regimen. 
Update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.6 of the SmPC of 
Stribild, Tybost and Genvoya and section 5.2 of the

The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
In addition, the Worksharing applicant (WSA) took

study GS-US-236-0140 which was conducted to provide 
information on renal function and markers of renal tubular 
function to address the safety 
concern of renal toxicity associated with 
tenofovir/disoproxil fumarate (TDF).The primary objective 
was to evaluate the effect of Stribild and other TDF-

markers of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in HIV-infected 
treatment-naïve adults with estimated GFR (eGFR) 
calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault equation (eGFRCG) ≥ 
70 mL/min. The results demonstrated that TDF-containing 
regimens administered as STB, TVD plus ATV/r, or ATR do 
not affect renal function as demonstrated by no effect in 
aGFR for up to 24 weeks in HIV-infected subjects. The 
results from Study GS-US-236-0140 also demonstrated 
that COBI does not affect the actual glomerular filtration 
rate and only affects the estimated glomerular filtration

rate due to inhibition of MATE1 transporter-mediated 
secretion of creatinine in the proximal tubules. Given these 
effects, the decreases in mean values seen for estimated 
glomerular filtration rates calculated using the Cockcroft-
Gault equation or the modification of diet in renal disease 
equation for COBI- and RTV-containing regimens were not 
considered clinically meaningful. In addition, there were no 
clinically relevant changes in markers of renal tubular 
functions (serum and urine creatinine, urine albumin, urine 
protein, urine β2-microglubulin, and urine RBP) for any of 
the treatment groups. 
Overall, the pharmacokinetic results were consistent with 
historical data for the respective treatments. 
All 4 study treatments were generally well tolerated and 
the safety profiles were as expected for these well 
characterized regimens, with no new safety findings 
reported. Based on these results no change to the product 
information was warranted.

Study GS-US-236-0135, is a Phase I study in healthy 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Worksharing procedure to update of section  4.5 of 
the SmPC of Stribild, Tybost and Vitekta based on a 
phase 1 study evaluating the drug interaction 
potential between telaprevir (TVR) and 
subjects that evaluated the drug-drug interaction potential 
of the HCV protease inhibitor telaprevir with the fixed dose 
combination tablet Stribild 
(elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF) and with 
Vitekta 85mg (elvitegravir) and atazanavir boosted by 
ritonavir.  
The study results did not indicate clinically significant

disoproxil fumarate single tablet regimen and 
between telaprevir and ritonavir-boosted atazanavir 
plus elvitegravir. . This study was conducted in 
fulfilment of MEA009 for Tybost. The PL is updated 
accordingly as relevant. Furthermore the MAH took 
the opportunity to revise section 6.1 of the SmPC list 
of excipients, to update the designation of the 
excipients.

interactions between telaprevir and Stribild nor between 
telaprevir and elvitegravir (with atazanavir/ritonavir). 
Section 4.5 of the SmPCs (and corresponding sections of 
the PLs) were updated to state that no dose adjustments 
are required when Stribild or Tybost are administered with 
telaprevir, nor when Vitekta is administered with ritonavir-
boosted atazanavir plus telaprevir. 
The most frequently reported adverse events reported in 
the study were in line with the safety profiles of the drugs 
administered and no new safety concerns were identified.

Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Worksharing application consisting of the submission 
of the results for study PC-236-2013 which assessed 
the effect of cobicistat, elvitegravir, emtricitabine on 
the in vitro cytotoxicity of tenofovir in 293T human 
embryonic kidney cells transiently expressing OAT1 
and MRP4. This study was performed in fulfilment of 
post authorisation measures for Stribild and Tybost.

2013 was conducted to assess the effect of the components 
of Stribild (emtricitabine, elvitegravir and cobicistat) / 
Tybost (cobicistat) on the in vitro cytotoxicity of tenofovir 
in HEK293T cells transiently expressing OAT1 and MRP4. 
These data indicate that the components of Stribild / 
Tybost are not likely to directly affect the toxicity of 
tenofovir in renal cells and tissues expressing renal 
transporters relevant for its active tubular secretion. No 
update of the product information for Stribild / Tybost is 
needed in the view of these data.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This application for a marketing authorisation for Aripiprazole Zentiva concerns a generic medicinal product of 
the centrally authorised product Abilify, which, at the time of this report, was available as tablets (5mg, 10mg, 
15mg and 30 mg), orodispersible tablets (10mg, 15mg and 30 mg), oral solution (1 mg/ml) and solution for 
injection (7.5 mg/ml).  
Aripiprazole is a quinolinone derivative, 7-{4-[4-(2, 3-dichlorophenyl)-1-piperazinyl]butyloxy}-3,4-dihydro- 
2(1H)-quinolinone, which exerts both agonistic and antagonistic activity at dopaminergic and serotonergic 
receptors, along with activities at other receptors. Abilify is approved for treatment of schizophrenia and manic 
episodes in Bipolar I Disorder as well as the prevention of manic episodes as follows: 
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and in adolescents aged 15 years and 
older.  
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for 
the prevention of a new manic episode in adults who experienced predominantly manic episodes and 
whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment.  
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment up to 12 weeks of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I 
Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older. 
The efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is thought to be mediated through a 
combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 
5HT2a receptors. For the treatment of schizophrenia, aripiprazole is given in an initial oral dose of 10 or 15 mg 
once daily. The recommended maintenance dose is 15 mg once daily. For the treatment of acute manic episodes 
in bipolar disorder, the recommended initial oral dose is 15 mg once daily as monotherapy, or combination 
therapy. For preventing recurrence of manic episodes, it is recommended to continue therapy at the same dose 
administered for treatment of acute episodes. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.  
This centralised application concerns a generic application according to article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC for 
Aripiprazole Zentiva 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets and Aripiprazole Zentiva 10mg, 15mg and 30mg 
orodispersable tablets.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/232319/2015 
Page 11/36 
 
  
  
The applicant, Zentiva k.s, provided the results of two bioequivalence studies using the originator as a reference 
product in order to support this application.  
To support this application the applicant, Zentiva k.s, has performed two bioequivalence studies, one for each 
pharmaceutical from using the 10 mg strength in both cases. The applicant furthermore applied for a biowaiver 
for the 15mg and 30mg strength (orodispersable tablets) and for the 5mg, 15mg and 30mg (tablets).  
The applicant has stated that according to the current GUIDELINE ON THE INVESTIGATION OF 
BIOEQUIVALENCE (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr), a bioequivalence study investigating only one 
strength may be acceptable provided as the proposed aripiprazole tablets and orodispersible tablets fulfil the  
following 5 conditions: 
 
 
 
 
the pharmaceutical products are manufactured by the same manufacturing process; 
the drug pharmacokinetics is linear; 
the qualitative composition of the different strengths is the same; 
the ratio between the amount of each excipient to the amount of active substance(s) is the same for 
all strengths (for immediate release products coating components, capsule shell, colour agents and 
flavours are not required to follow this rule); 
 
the dissolution profiles are similar under identical conditions for the additional strengths and the 
strength of the batch used in the bioequivalence study. 
Justifications of compliance with the five conditions as stated above have been provided. Comparative 
dissolution studies have been provided and a biowaiver was requested for the remaining strengths. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented in the form of 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg or 30 mg tablets and 10 mg, 15 mg or 
30 mg orodispersible tablets (ODT), containing aripiprazole as active substance.  
Other ingredients of the tablets are: lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, crospovidone, 
hydroxypropyl cellulose, silica colloidal anhydrous, croscarmellose sodium and magnesium stearate. The 
orodispersable tablets contain, in addition, acesulfame potassium and mango flavour. 
The product is available in OPA/Alu/PVC/Alu foil blisters (Alu-Alu blister) in a carton box.

EMA/CHMP/232319/2015 
Page 12/36 
 
  
  
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of aripiprazole is 7-[4-[4-(2,3-Dichlorophenyl)piperazin-1-yl]butoxy]-3,4-dihydroquinolin 
-2(1H)-one and has the following structure: 
The structure has been confirmed using elemental analysis, IR, UV, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectroscopy, and 
mass spectrometry. 
The active substance is a white to yellowish crystalline hygroscopic powder, which is practically insoluble in 
water, soluble in methylene chloride and very slightly soluble in ethanol (96 per cent).  
Aripiprazole has a non-chiral molecular structure. Aripiprazole shows polymorphism. Several polymorphic forms 
have been identified: crystal forms A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and an amorphous form. It has been confirmed that the 
active substance manufacturers consistently produce the same crystal form B.  
The information on the active substance is provided according to the Active Substance Master File (ASMF) 
procedure. Two ASMFs have been submitted. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Aripiprazole is synthesized in four main steps using commercially available well defined starting materials with 
acceptable specifications. In the original submission the applicant proposed a two-step synthesis. During the 
evaluation procedure the API starting materials were redefined by both ASMF holders to ensure full control of the 
quality of the active substance in line with ICH Q11. Although some of the starting materials proposed by the 
active substance manufacturers and some intermediates generated during the synthesis have a structural alert 
for genotoxicity, data presented demonstrate that the manufacturing process proposed by both ASMF holders is 
capable of removing or purging these compounds to acceptable limits. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of 
both ASMFs and it was considered satisfactory.

Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, solubility, identification (IR, HPLC), assay 
(HPLC), related substances (HPLC), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.), polymorphism (XRD), 
appearance of solution (Ph. Eur.), residual solvents (GC), heavy metals (ICP-MS), bacterial endotoxins 
(Ph. Eur.), microbial contamination (Ph. Eur.) and particle size (laser diffraction).  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.    
Batch analysis data on 3 pilot scale batches from each active substance manufacturer were provided. The results 
are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on three pilot scale batches (from one of the active substance manufacturers) and three 
commercial scale batches (from the other proposed manufacturer of the active substance) stored in the 
intended commercial package for 12 or 9 months, respectively, under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH, 
and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided. In addition, supportive stability studies from three commercial scale batches manufactured prior to 
process optimization (which involved minor changes on the crystallization and drying processes which were 
shown to have no impact on stability), and stored for 60 months at long term conditions and 6 months under 
accelerated conditions were provided. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance, polymorphism, assay, related substances, loss on drying, 
particle size and microbial contamination. 
All parameters remained within the proposed specification. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch from each same 
manufacturer, showing that the active substance is photostable.  
Results from stress studies under heat, light, oxidizing, humidic, alkaline and acidic conditions were also 
provided on one batch from each manufacturer. Aripiprazole was found to be resistant against elevated 
temperature, basic conditions and light. Significant decomposition of aripiprazole occurred under oxidation and 
acidic conditions. The results from these studies confirmed the stability indicating nature of the HPLC method 
proposed for assay and related substances. 
The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. 
The stability results indicate that the drug substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The product is presented in two pharmaceutical forms: 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets; and 10 mg, 
15 mg, and 30 mg orodispersible tablets. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/232319/2015 
Page 14/36 
 
  
  
The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to produce stable aripiprazole tablets and aripiprazole 
orodispersible tablets bioequivalent to the reference medicinal product Abilify tablets and Abilify orodispersible 
tablets, respectively.  
The applicant conducted pre-formulation studies to evaluate key physicochemical characteristics of the active 
substance which could influence the performance of the finished product (particle size, solubility, stability, etc.). 
The solubility studies concluded that the drug substance shows a pH dependant solubility, which decreases when 
increasing the pH of the media. The solubility increases with the addition of sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) up to 
the level when saturation is reached. Polymorphic screening studies concluded that the polymorphic form 
produced by both manufacturers, form B, is stable. No polymorphic form conversion of the drug substance 
supplied by any of the active substance manufacturers during the manufacturing of the finished product, or 
storage under different stress conditions in different primary packaging, was observed. In addition, no 
significant increase in the impurity levels of drug substance was detected, leading to the conclusion that 
aripiprazole is a stable active substance. 
The selection of the excipients was primarily based on the composition of the reference medicinal product and on 
the results from compatibility studies of the active substance with individual excipients.  
The qualitative composition of the different tablet and orodispersable tablet strengths are the same. The 
different tablet strengths are dose/weight proportional.  
The excipients selected for the tablets are: lactose monohydrate (diluent), microcrystalline cellulose (diluent), 
hydroxy propyl cellulose (binder), magnesium stearate (lubricant), which are also present in the reference 
medicinal product and, crospovidone (disintegrant), croscarmellose sodium (disintegrant) and silica colloidal 
anhydrous (glidant). 
The excipients selected for the orodispersible tablets are: microcrystalline cellulose, crospovidone, 
croscarmellose sodium, acesulfame potassium (sweetener), and magnesium stearate, which are also present in 
the reference medicinal product and, lactose monohydrate, hydroxy propyl cellulose, silica colloidal anhydrous 
(glidant) and mango flavour. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. 
There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 
6.1 of the SmPC. 
Different approaches were tried for the manufacture of Aripiprazole tablets. Based on the results from these 
studies wet granulation was selected for further development. 
The formulation used during clinical studies is the same that the used for marketing. 
Results from two bioequivalence studies comparing the 10 mg tablets and 10 mg orodispersible tablets of the 
test and reference product were provided.  
A request for a biowaiver for the other strengths (5mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets; and 15 mg and 30 mg 
orodispersible tablets) was submitted on the basis that: all the strengths are manufactured by the same 
manufacturer using the same manufacturing process, the qualitative composition of the different strengths is 
the same, the composition of the strengths are quantitatively proportional, formulation, aripiprazole exhibits 
linear pharmacokinetics in the proposed dose range, aripiprazole exhibits good solubility in the gastrointestinal 
pH range, and the similarity of the dissolution profiles of the different strengths as described below. 
In this regard, data from in vitro dissolution tests at three different buffers (0.1 N HCl, pH 4.5 acetate buffer and 
pH 6.8 phosphate buffer) and the media intended for drug product release (QC media), obtained with biobatches

(10 mg) and additional strengths of both tablets (5mg, 15 mg and 30 mg) and ODT (15 mg and 30 mg) were also 
presented. The results from these studies demonstrated that dissolution profiles of all strengths in all dissolution 
media were similar since in 0.1 N HCl more than 85% of the active substance was released from the tablets and 
ODT within 15 min, and in pH 4.5 and 6.8 the similarity factor (f2) values obtained above 50. 
The discriminatory power of the dissolution method was also demonstrated. 
The primary packaging is Alu-Alu blisters in a carton box. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate 
for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process for both the tablets and the orodispersible tablets consists of seven main steps: dry 
mixing, wet granulation, drying, milling, lubrication, compression and packaging. The process is considered to 
be a standard manufacturing process. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been demonstrated 
that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible 
manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process.  
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: description, 
identification (HPLC, UV), weight, uniformity of mass (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), 
disintegration time (Ph. Eur.), water content (Karl Fisher), dissolution, assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), 
microbial contamination (Ph. Eur.). The specification of the orodispersible tablets also included fineness of 
dispersion. 
Batch analysis results are provided for four batches of tablets per strength and two batches of orodispersible 
tablet per strength confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the 
intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data of one pilot and two commercial scale batches of aripiprazole 5 mg and 30 mg tablets 
manufactured by the proposed finished product manufacturer and stored for 36 months under long term 
conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH, for 12 months under intermediate conditions at 30 ºC / 65% RH, and for 6 months 
under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
Additional stability data from four commercial scale batches of aripiprazole 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg 
tablets stored for up to 12 months under long term and intermediate conditions and 6 months at accelerated 
conditions were also presented. 
For the orodispersible tablets stability data of one pilot and two commercial scale batches of aripiprazole 10 mg 
and 30 mg orodispersible tablets manufactured by the proposed finished product manufacturer and stored for 
36 months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH, for 12 months under intermediate conditions at 30 ºC 
/ 65% RH,  and for 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines 
were provided.  
Additional stability data from two commercial scale batches of aripiprazole 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg 
orodispersible tablets stored for up to 6 months under long term, intermediate conditions and accelerated 
conditions were also presented. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/232319/2015 
Page 16/36 
 
  
  
The batches of aripiprazole tablets and orodispersible tablets were identical to those proposed for marketing and 
were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for appearance, disintegration, dissolution, assay, related substances, water content, 
fineness of dispersion (orodispersible tablets only) and microbial test. The analytical procedures used are 
stability indicating. 
All results complied with the proposed specification at all-time points tested. Therefore, based on available 
stability data, the shelf-life as stated in the SmPC is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those used 
to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of ruminant 
material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal 
Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have 
a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give reassurance on 
viral/TSE safety.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects   
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is 
based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to generate 
additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects of the 
SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been discussed and was 
considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/232319/2015 
Page 17/36 
 
  
  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment (ERA) 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the introduction of 
Aripiprazole Zentiva is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for 
all aripiprazole containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA 
is expected to be similar and not increased. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspect 
For a generic of a reference medicinal product no toxicological and pharmacological tests are required. The 
CHMP concluded that no additional non-clinical data were required.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for 4 different strengths of aripiprazole tablets (5, 10, 15, 30 mg) and 3 different strengths 
of aripiprazole orodispersible tablets (10, 15, 30 mg). To support the marketing authorisation application the 
applicant conducted two bioequivalence studies with cross-over design under fasting conditions. 
The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as 
efficacy and safety of aripiprazole based on published literature. The SmPC is in line with the SmPC of the 
reference product. 
No CHMP scientific advice pertinent to the clinical development was given for this medicinal product.  
For the clinical assessment the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98) in 
its current version is of particular relevance. 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Exemption  
According to the current GUIDELINE ON THE INVESTIGATION OF BIOEQUIVALENCE (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 
Rev. 1/ Corr), a bioequivalence study investigating only one strength for each pharmaceutical form may be 
acceptable if all of the following 5 conditions are fulfilled: 
 
 
 
the pharmaceutical products are manufactured by the same manufacturing process; 
the drug pharmacokinetics is linear; 
the qualitative composition of the different strengths is the same; 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/232319/2015 
Page 18/36 
 
  
  
 
the ratio between the amount of each excipient to the amount of active substance(s) is the same for all 
strengths (for immediate release products coating components, capsule shell, colour agents and 
flavours are not required to follow this rule); 
 
the dissolution profiles are similar under identical conditions for the additional strengths and the 
strength of the batch used in the bioequivalence study. 
The applicant stated that the proposed aripiprazole tablets and oral dispersible tablets fulfil the above criteria 
since the manufacturing process for all the strengths for each pharmaceutical form are the same, the PK was 
linear, and the composition of the different strengths is the same and proportional, i.e. the ratio between 
amounts of active compound and excipients are identical for all the strengths. 
Comparative dissolution studies with Aripiprazole 5 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets against the bioequivalence 
study batch i.e. Aripiprazole 10 mg tablets were conducted in 0.1N HCL, pH 4.5, and pH 6.8 with F2 values above 
50. The comparative dissolutions of Aripiprazole 15 mg and 30 mg orodispersible tablets against the 
bioequivalence study batch i.e. Aripiprazole 10 mg orodispersible tablets were conducted in 0.1N HCL, pH 4.5, 
and pH 6.8 with F2 values above 50. The drug input has been shown to be linear over the therapeutic range. 
The choice of the 10 mg tablets over the highest 30 mg strength for the BE studies was also discussed by the 
CHMP and considered acceptable in line with the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence,  which states 
that lower strengths may be selected for safety reasons. The CHMP considered indeed that there was a risk of 
adverse reactions of acute laryngeal dystonia, which increases with dose, thus justifying selection of a lower 
dose for the BE study in healthy subjects. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
To support the application, the applicant has submitted two bioequivalence studies. 
Study ARZ-BESD-03-ZNV/10 
Methods 
This was a randomised, open-label, two-period, two-sequence, single dose, two-way  crossover comparative 
oral bioavailability study to establish comparative bioequivalence of  Aripiprazole 10 mg tablets (Zentiva) and 
Abilify 10 mg tablets (Bristol Myers Squibb Italy) in 36 healthy, adult, male human subjects under fasting 
conditions. The objective of the study was to compare the rate and extent of absorption of both products and to 
monitor the adverse events to ensure the safety and tolerability of a single dose of Aripiprazole 10 mg. 
Study design  
Based on the randomised schedule and following an overnight fast of at least 6 hours in both periods each 
volunteer received a single oral dose of one Aripiprazole 10 mg tablet (either the reference or test product) with 
200 ml of water in period I and in period II.  
Subjects were dosed while in sitting posture and were instructed to remain seated in an upright position for the 
first 8 hours following drug administration. Drinking water was not permitted one hour before dosing and until 
one hour post dose. Subjects were confined to the clinical facility from at least 12 hours prior to each drug 
administration until after the 72-hour blood sample collection in each study period. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/232319/2015 
Page 19/36 
 
  
  
The two periods were separated by a wash-out phase of at least 42 days.  
Blood samples were taken at the following time points: pre-dose and at 10 minutes, 20minutes, 30 
minutes,0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.25, 3.5, 3.75, 4, 4.25, 4.50, 4.75, 5, 5.5, 6, 9, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 72 hours 
after dosing. Blood sampling time adjustments are presented in the dossier. 
Table 1 - Test and reference products  
Population studied 
36 healthy adult male human subjects were enrolled as per the protocol. The study started with 36 subjects and 
35 completed the study. 
Main inclusion criteria: 
Healthy human adult literate male non-smoker subjects aged 45 years of age or older, having a body mass index 
(BMI) between 18.5 and 30 kg/m2 (inclusive) who had no evidence of underlying disease or clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory values at screening and who voluntarily consented to participate in the study in written 
form.

Protocol deviations;  
Subject number 18 dropped out from the study for personal reasons. One minor deviation from the study 
protocol (one subject (2) took counteractive medication for headache) was the only registered deviation.  
Analytical methods   
Analysis of aripiprazole was performed using test method ARZ-BE-LCMSMS-01/10.   
This HPLC/MS/MS method involved the extraction of aripiprazole and the internal standard aripiprazole-d8 from 
human plasma. Samples were kept frozen at -20ºC prior to analysis for a period of 48 days. During transport the 
samples were kept for 2 days at -70 ºC however this excursion is covered in the validation of the test method.  
A total of 1846 blood samples were to be collected for the 35 subjects. 1 sample was re-assayed and 
140 samples were identified for incurred sample reanalysis. 100.00% is the percentage of samples where the 
difference between the two values was less than 20% of the mean for chromatographic assays or less than 30% 
for the ligand binding assays.  
The method has been validated (ARZ-BE-LCMSMS-01/10) and partially re-validated 4 times. The following 
parameters were addressed; selectivity of Aripiprazole and the internal standard (IS), calibration curve 
(linearity), carryover test, recovery of both the analyte and the internal standard, precision, accuracy, dilution 
integrity accuracy and precision, stability of the stock solution (short and long term stability in the biological 
matrix, bench top, freeze-thaw, auto sampler storage, and post-preparative stability), haemolysis effect 
accuracy and precision, ruggedness and matrix effect. Each parameter has been assessed and the limits are 
justified. This is deemed acceptable.  
The effect of interfering drugs was also studied using the following commonly used medicines: caffeine, 
acetylsalicylic acid, tramadol, paracetamol, and ibuprofen. No effect on the determination of the analyte and the 
internal standard was observed.  
The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of this method for the estimation of Aripiprazole concentrations in 
plasma was 0.250ng/ml (Precision 4.681%, Accuracy 117.733%). The linearity range of Aripiprazole was from 
0.250g/ml to 100.000ng/ml. (8 point curve) 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) variables  
Primary parameters:  AUC0-72 and Cmax  
Secondary parameters: Tmax. 
Bioequivalence criteria: The 90% confidence interval of the relative mean AUC0-72 and Cmax of the test and 
reference product should be at least 80.00% and not more than 125.00% for log-transformed data. 
Statistical methods   
The 90% confidence interval of the relative mean AUC0-72 and Cmax of the test and reference product should be 
at least 80% and not more than 125% for log-transformed data. ANOVA was performed on the log-transformed 
pharmacokinetic parameters - AUC0-72 and Cmax of aripiprazole using General Linear Model (PROC GLM procedure) 
of SAS. The 90% confidence interval for the difference between the least square means (LSM) was calculated for 
the log-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters - AUC0-72 and Cmax of aripiprazole. The number of observations,

arithmetic mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation (CV %), minimum, median, maximum and 
geometric mean were calculated for all the pharmacokinetic parameters. 
Results 
The results are summarised in table 1 and 2 below. 
Table 2 - Pharmacokinetic parameters for Aripiprazole 10mg  (non-transformed values) 
Table 3 - Statistical analysis for Aripiprazole 10mg (ln-transformed values) 
Safety data 
Both formulations were well tolerated, with no major side effects and no relevant differences in safety profiles 
were observed between the preparations. 
Three adverse events out of which two of mild intensity and one of moderate intensity occurred in three subjects 
in the present study. These were not serious adverse events. The volunteers that encountered the adverse 
events completely recovered before the end of the study. No statistical significant differences between the test 
and reference treatments, for the incidence of subjects having experienced adverse events and for the incidence 
of adverse events were seen.

of both products and to monitor the adverse events to ensure the safety and tolerability of a single dose of 
Aripiprazole 10 mg.  
Study design  
Based on the randomised schedule and following an overnight fast of at least 8 hours in both periods each 
volunteer received a single oral dose of Aripiprazole 10mg orodispersable tablet to be placed entirely in the 
mouth and allowed to disperse in saliva. Subjects received either one tablet of the reference or test product in 
period I and period II.  
Subjects were dosed while in sitting posture and were instructed to remain seated in an upright position for the 
first 8 hours following drug administration. Drinking water was not permitted one hour before dosing and until 
one hour post dose. Subjects were confined to the clinical facility from at least 12 hours prior to each drug 
administration until after the 72-hour blood sample collection in each study period.

Safety data 
Both formulations were well tolerated, with no major side effects and no relevant differences in safety profiles 
were observed between the preparations. Five adverse events of moderate intensity occurred in two subjects in 
the study. These were not serious adverse events (Headache and Urticaria). The volunteers that encountered

Conclusions 
Based on the presented bioequivalence studies, Aripiprazole Zentiva 10mg orodispersable tablets and 
Aripiprazole Zentiva 10mg tablets are considered bioequivalent with Abilify 10mg orodispersable tablets and 
Abilify 10mg tablets of Bristol-Myers Squibb GmbH Italy, respectively. 
The results for the 10 mg tablet and the 10 mg orodispersable tablet strengths can be extrapolated to the other 
respective strengths for each pharmaceutical form applied for, according to conditions provided for in the 
Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application. 
2.4.4.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
In support of this application,results from two bioequivalence (BE) studies were provided, one for the tablets 
and one for the orodispersible tablets, both using the 10 mg strength formulation. For all other strength a 
biowaiver was claimed. 
The results of the two BE studies showed that both the 10mg tablet and orodispersible tablets were 
bioequivalent to the reference product Abilify. Results of study ARZ-BESD-03-ZNV/10 with the 10mg tablet 
formulation could be extrapolated to Aripiprazole 15mg and 30mg tablets and results of study 
ARZ-BESD-02-ZNV/10 with the 10 mg orodispersable tablet formulation could be extrapolated to Aripiprazole

30mg orodispersable tablet according to conditions in the Guideline on the Investigation Bioequivalence 
CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev 1. The 5mg tablet and the 15mg orodispersable tablet request for a biowaiver 
was also accepted as initially identified issues pertaining to dissolution concerns for those two pharmaceutical 
forms had been resolved at the time of this report.  
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
Based on the submitted bioequivalence study results, Aripiprazole 10 mg orodispersible tablets of Zentiva are 
considered bioequivalent with Abilify 10 mg orodispersible tablets of Bristol-Myers Squibb GmbH Italy and 
Aripiprazole 10 mg tablets of Zentiva are considered bioequivalent with Abilify 10mg tablets of Bristol-Myers 
Squibb GmbH Italy in healthy adult male patients under fasting conditions.  
As all criteria for a biowaiver were met, the CHMP agreed that the results of study ARZ-BESD-03-ZNV/10 with 
the 10 mg tablet formulation can be extrapolated to Aripiprazole the 5mg, 15mg and 30mg tablets and the 
results of study ARZ-BESD-02-ZNV/10 with the 10 mg orodispersible tablet formulation can be extrapolated to 
Aripiprazole 15mg and 30mg orodispersible tablets according to conditions in the Guideline on the Investigation 
Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev 1.

2.7.  PSUR submission 
At the time of granting the marketing authorisation, the submission of periodic safety update reports is not 
required for this medicinal product. However, the marketing authorisation holder shall submit periodic safety 
update reports for this medicinal product if the product is included in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) 
provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83 and published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.8.  Product information 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
The applicant has submitted a full user test for Aripiprazole Zentiva 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg orodispersible 
tablets. The results of this user consultation show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as 
set out in the Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet for Aripiprazole Zentiva 5 mg, 10 mg, 
15 mg and 30 mg tablets has been performed on the basis of a bridging report making reference to Aripiprazole 
Zentiva orodispersible tablets. The bridging report submitted by the applicant has been found acceptable.  
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of Aripiprazole tablets and Aripiprazole orodispersable tablets.  
The reference product Abilify is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and in adolescents aged 
15 years and older, treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention 
of a new manic episode in adults who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes 
responded to aripiprazole treatment as well as treatment up to 12 weeks of moderate to severe manic episodes 
in Bipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older. 
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available 
nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/232319/2015 
Page 34/36 
 
  
  
perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well 
as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical aspects 
based on information from published literature was considered sufficient. 
The two bioequivalence studies formed the pivotal basis of the application. The study designs were considered 
adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of the two formulations applied for and were in line with the respective 
European requirements.  
The test formulations of Aripiprazole Zentiva 10 mg tablets and Aripiprazole Zentiva 10 mg orodispersable 
tablets met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when compared with respectively Abilify 10 mg 
tablets and Abilify 10 mg orodispersable tablets. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Aripiprazole Zentiva in the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and in adolescents aged 
15 years and older, treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention 
of a new manic episode in adults who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes 
responded to aripiprazole treatment as well as treatment up to 12 weeks of moderate to severe manic episodes 
in Bipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older is favourable and therefore recommends the

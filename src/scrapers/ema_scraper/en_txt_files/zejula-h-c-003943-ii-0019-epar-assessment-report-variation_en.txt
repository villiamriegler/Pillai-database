2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
The applied indication was for Zejula in monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients 
with advanced high-grade ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response 
(complete or partial) following completion of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. 
Epidemiology  
Ovarian cancer is the fifth overall cause of cancer death in women, representing 5% of all cancer deaths. 
It is also the deadliest of gynaecologic cancers in 2014, 14,270 women in the United States (US) and 18,303 
in the European Union (EU) died from ovarian cancer.  
Across Europe, the estimated age standardised rate of newly diagnosed ovarian cancer cases in 2020 is 
15.5/100,000 and the mortality is 10.3/100,000 (ECIS 2020).  
Biologic features 
Epithelial ovarian cancer represents the majority of malignant ovarian neoplasm (about 90%) (Chan JK et 
al 2006; Jelovac D et al. 2011). The World Health Organization (WHO) classification of surface epithelial 
ovarian tumours includes six major histotypes - serous, mucinous, endometrioid, clear cell, transitional 
cell and epithelial-stromal. The serous subtype of ovarian carcinoma accounts for approximately 60-80% 
of ovarian cancer cases and is the most aggressive type of ovarian cancer. Grade is an additional 
prognostic determinant and a number of grading systems currently exist which are derived from 
reviewing the following tumour characteristics: architectural features, mitotic counts and nuclear atypia 
(ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines, 2013). Low grade (grade 1, well differentiated) serous ovarian 
carcinoma is considered a distinct type of disease compared with high grade (grade 2 and 3 – moderately 
and poorly differentiated) serous carcinoma based on a number of clinical and molecular features, thus 
forming a 2 tier classification of low and high grade disease widely accepted and used in clinical practice 
(Levanon et al 2008; Vang et al 2009). 
Breast cancer genes (BRCA) 1 and 2 are tumour suppressors that play a role in DNA repair: a deleterious 
mutation in BRCA leads to an inability to repair DNA via the homologous recombination pathway. 
Approximately 15%-22% of ovarian cancer patients have germline or somatic BRCA mutations (Alsop et 
Assessment report  
EMA/531223/2020 
Page 10/168 
 
 
  
  
 
al. 2012, Cancer Genome Atlas Research N 2011, Hennessy et al. 2010, Pal et al. 2010, Pennington et al. 
2014). 
Recent research shows that homologous recombination deficiency can also be induced by other genes 
involved in DNA damage repair or by genetic alterations such as DNA methylation that lead to genomic 
instability. Approximately 41% to 50% of newly diagnosed ovarian carcinomas are estimated to exhibit 
homologous recombination deficiency (Elvin et al. 2017, Moschetta et al. 2016) which is also a phenotype 
that predicts improved rate of responses to platinum-based therapy and PARP inhibitors relative to 
tumours that are homologous recombination proficient (Kaufman et al. 2015).  
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Ovarian  cancer  is  often  asymptomatic  in  the  early  stages  and  is,  therefore,  first  detected  in  advanced 
stages,  when  prognosis  is  poor.  For  women  who  do  experience  symptoms  in  the  early  stages,  ovarian 
cancer  is  sometimes  misdiagnosed  because  the  majority  of  symptoms  are  nonspecific.  These  symptoms 
may overlap those of gastrointestinal and other diseases, and as a result, many patients may be treated 
incorrectly for months or years. 
The advanced stage at which ovarian cancer is generally detected is reflected in the 5-year survival rates; 
46% across all stages and 29% for advanced stages (Siegel et al 2017).  
Management 
The paradigm for first-line treatment of newly diagnosed ovarian cancer includes a combination of 
surgery and chemotherapy: either primary debulking surgery (PDS) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy 
or neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) with subsequent interval debulking surgery (IDS) followed by 
additional chemotherapy. Worldwide, the use of NACT is increasing in patients with large volume Stage 
IIIC/IV disease, such that 45-60% of these patients will receive NACT (Epi Flatiron Database EMR 
Database 2019, Liu et al. 2017, Vergote et al. 2010, Monitor IHGO 2019, Nicklin et al. 2017). The 
preferred standard of care chemotherapy regimen is carboplatin and paclitaxel, based upon an improved 
toxicity profile and comparable efficacy when compared to cisplatin and paclitaxel (Ozol et al. 2003, 
duBois et al. 2005). 
Bevacizumab is an additional option for first line treatment. The addition of bevacizumab to every-3-week 
paclitaxel and carboplatin, followed by continuation of maintenance for up to 15 cycles with bevacizumab 
improved PFS over placebo in the Phase 3 GOG 218 study (PFS hazard ratio [HR] 0.62) and in the high-
risk population subgroup, as defined by Stage and residual disease, in the open-label Phase 3 ICON 7 
study (PFS HR 0.68) (Burger et al. 2003, Perren et al. 2011). However, bevacizumab provided no overall 
survival benefit in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population in either study.  
Olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, was approved for use as a maintenance treatment in patients with ovarian 
cancer and a mutation in the breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCAmut) following complete response 
(CR) or partial response (PR) to first line platinum based chemotherapy based on an improvement in PFS 
over placebo (HR 0.30; [OS data is not yet available]) in study SOLO-1 (see SmPC Lynparza). 
Data were recently reported from the Phase 3 PAOLA trial, which assessed the combination of 
bevacizumab plus olaparib versus bevacizumab in the ovarian cancer front line setting. Clinical benefit of 
the combination was observed in patients with homologous recombination deficiency (HR 0.33) but not in 
the remaining population (HR 0.92) (Ray-Coquard et al., paper presented at European Society for Medical 
Oncology 2019).  
Observation, or “watch and wait” after response to first line therapy is included in the National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), European Society for Medical Oncology, and American Society of 
Assessment report  
EMA/531223/2020

Clinical Oncology guidelines and is the approach currently taken for the majority (>75%) of patients with 
advanced ovarian cancer (Epi Flatiron Database EMR Database 2019, Liu et al. 2017, Colombo et al. 
2019). 
Despite high response rates to first line standard-of-care platinum-based chemotherapy, 85% of patients 
with advanced ovarian cancer will experience disease recurrence and ultimately die of the disease. 
Prolonging the benefit of first line platinum is currently the best chance these patients have to avoid 
recurrence and potentially improve survival outcomes. Development of new therapies is essential to 
address the unmet medical need and improve the overall outlook for patients with this lethal cancer 
(Lorusso et al. 2012).  
2.1.2.  About the product 
Niraparib is an orally available, highly selective poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) -1 
and -2 inhibitor exhibiting potent anti-tumour activity through the direct inhibition of PARP.  
To date, niraparib has been approved in 37 countries for use in patients with ovarian cancer. 
Zejula (niraparib) was approved on 16 November 2017 by the European Commission with the following 
indication: “As monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with platinum-sensitive 
relapsed high grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in 
response (complete or partial) to platinum-based chemotherapy”. The basis for this indication was the 
phase III study named NOVA. NOVA was a double-blind, 2:1 randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, 
global clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of niraparib as maintenance treatment for 
patients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent, ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who had 
received at least 2 platinum-based regimens and were in response (CR or PR) following completion of last 
platinum-based chemotherapy. Platinum-sensitive was defined by complete response (CR) or partial 
response (PR) for more than 6 months to their penultimate (next to last) platinum-based therapy. The 
recommended posology in this indication is three 100 mg hard capsules once daily, equivalent to a total 
daily dose of 300 mg. Dose reductions may be implemented based on adverse reactions. The 
recommended dose reductions are first from three hard capsules daily (300 mg) to two hard capsules 
daily (200 mg). If further dose reduction is needed, a second dose reduction from two hard capsules daily 
(200 mg) to one capsule daily (100 mg) may be implemented (see SmPC section 4.2). 
The SmPC also includes a statement that a starting dose of 200 mg for patients weighing less than 58 kg 
may be considered. 
The MAH was encouraged to further investigate alternative dosing strategies to reduce adverse events for 
niraparib while still maintaining clinical efficacy. 
In the present Type II Variation, the MAH is seeking authorisation to extend the indication to first-line 
treatment: “for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced high-grade ovarian, fallopian 
tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) following completion of first-
line platinum-based chemotherapy.”  
This is based on data from a Phase 3 trial called PRIMA, a double-blind, multicenter, randomised, 
placebo-controlled 2:1 (niraparib:placebo) study in subjects with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary 
peritoneal cancer, collectively referred to as ovarian cancer. 
With this application, the MAH seeks approval for a starting dose of 200 mg for the first-line ovarian 
cancer maintenance treatment. However, for patients weighing ≥77 kg and having baseline platelet count 
≥150,000/µL, the recommended starting dose of Zejula is 300 mg. 
Assessment report  
EMA/531223/2020 
Page 12/168 
 
 
  
  
The final recommended indication for Zejula as monotherapy is for the maintenance treatment of adult 
patients with advanced epithelial (FIGO Stages III and IV) high-grade ovarian, fallopian tube or primary 
peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) following completion of first-line platinum-
based chemotherapy. 
In first line ovarian maintenance treatment, the recommended starting dose of Zejula is 200 mg (two 
100-mg capsules), taken once daily. However, for those patients who weigh ≥ 77 kg and have baseline 
platelet count ≥ 150,000/μL, the recommended starting dose of Zejula is 300 mg (three 100-mg 
capsules), taken once daily. 
It is recommended that treatment should be continued until disease progression or toxicity. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
A full environmental risk assessment (Phase I and Phase II Tier A and Tier B) has been completed for 
niraparib tosylate (initiated as part of the initial MAA procedure and completed in 2019). The PECSURFACE 
WATER was refined based on the prevalence of ovarian cancer, thus the proposed extended indication to 
include patients who are in response following completion of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy will 
not lead to altered PECSURFACE WATER. No further assessment is therefore considered required.  
It can be concluded that niraparib is unlikely to represent as risk to the environment. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of niraparib.  
Considering the above data, niraparib is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP

Introduction 
The clinical pharmacokinetics of niraparib have previously been investigated in three clinical studies: 
PN001, NOVA and NOVA-food-effect sub-study (Table 2). These studies were performed to support 
the initial marketing application for the use of niraparib 300 mg once daily in platinum-sensitive recurrent 
ovarian cancer who are in response to second-line or greater platinum-based chemotherapy. 
Table 3 summarised the key PK characteristics of niraparib established in previous procedures (see also 
Zejula EPAR and SmPC).

During the initial MAA review, it was noted that the majority of patients in the pivotal study (NOVA) had 
dose reductions due to adverse events. After 4 months and onwards, ~25% received 300 mg, 
~45% received 200 mg and ~30% received 100 mg daily.  
To support the current application to extend the indication to patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian 
cancer in response to first-line therapy, the results of a Phase 3 randomised, placebo-controlled study 
(“PRIMA study”) have been submitted. The PRIMA study was initiated with a starting dose of 300 mg QD 
for all patients. At the time of implementation of Protocol Amendment 2 (protocol dated 16 November 
2017), 317 patients (65%) had been enrolled with this starting dose. Then, due to a high frequency of 
dose interruptions and dose reductions with this starting dose and in order to improve the safety profile 
of niraparib, a dosing algorithm (termed “individualised starting dose [ISD]” by the MAH, see Table 4) 
previously applied (variation EMEA/H/004249/II/0006, withdrawn) was implemented for the remaining 
170 patients (35%) who were randomized to active treatment.  
The ISD regimen was derived from retrospective, exploratory statistical multivariable analysis of the 
NOVA data to investigate predictors of Grade 3 thrombocytopenia. Baseline body weight and platelet 
counts were identified as predictors of adverse events that required dose modification in patients treated 
with niraparib at 300 mg QD based on a classification tree analysis. Patients with body weight <77 kg or 
platelet counts <150,000/μL at baseline had higher rates of Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (35% versus 
12%) and were more likely to require dose modification to 200 mg within the first two months of 
treatment with only 17% of patients with these baseline characteristics remaining on 300 mg by Month 4. 
On this basis, it was proposed to test a lower starting dose (200 mg daily) in this subgroup, while the 
remaining patients should still start on 300 mg daily. 
The PRIMA study was not originally designed for testing multiple dose levels and was not powered for 
statistically testing of the efficacy at the lower dose (see clinical efficacy).

No new dedicated clinical pharmacology studies have been submitted to support the current application. 
Additional PK data were sparsely collected from patients in PRIMA. These PK data were used to update a 
previously established population PK (popPK) model and re-investigate covariates impacting the PK of 
niraparib.

Methods 
• 
Analytical methods in PRIMA trial 
The analysis of patient samples from study PR-30-5017-C (PRIMA) of niraparib in human (K3EDTA) 
plasma have been performed by an LC-MS/MS method (report KB-0226-RB-CS). The validation reports 
included a validation report of long-time stability, KB-0179-RB-CL. 
The main validation KB-0167-RB-CV was performed pre-study and included all important parameters 
according to the Guideline on bioanalytical method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1 
Corr. 2** Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). The objective was to develop and 
validate an analytical method for quantification of Niraparib and M1 in human plasma (K3EDTA) using D7-
Niraparib and D7-M1 as the respective internal standards.  
• 
Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
All PK data in the PRIMA trial have been analysed using popPK modelling. No non-compartmental 
analyses have been performed.

Evaluation and Qualification of models 
PopPK modelling  
Previous models 
•  Model #1. A two-compartment model with first-order absorption and linear elimination with no 
identified covariate effects, was submitted to support the initial MAA. Data were available 
from two studies: PN001 and NOVA. 
•  Model #2. A refined modelling report (TES-PKER-NIRAPARIB-648) was submitted to support 
the type II variation to alter the posology in the currently approved indication (which was 
eventually withdrawn). Data were available from two studies: PN001 and NOVA, i.e. the same 
data set as Model #1. The final model was a two-compartment model with linear elimination and 
a constant (zero-order) rate of drug release into the absorption compartment preceded by an 
absorption lag time, with the released drug absorbed into the central compartment at a first-
order rate. The following covariate effects were identified: increase in duration of zero-order 
drug release in fed/unknown prandial state, increase in apparent clearance (CL/F) and 
apparent peripheral volume of distribution (Vp/F) with increasing albumin, and decrease in 
relative bioavailability with increasing body weight. The covariate effects had only a minor 
impact on exposure (<20%). Overall, the model was considered to describe the data 
adequately, although the biological plausibility of body weight influencing bioavailability was 
questioned. 
•  Model #3. A refined model was developed based on the above data added to the data from the 
QUADRA study (n=455). This model was not submitted in any prior procedure and was 
provided upon request with this application (report reference TESA-PMX-NIRAPARIB-893). 
The final model was a 3-compartment model with linear elimination and a constant rate of drug 
release into the absorption compartment preceded by a lag time, and first-order absorption. The 
same covariate effects as for Model #2 were identified (prandial state, albumin, body 
weight) in addition to decreasing CL/F with increasing age. 
Models in current application

•  Model #4. The initial submission included a full modelling report (report reference TESA-PMX-
NIRAPARIB-1391, dated 02 December 2019) for a model updated with data from the PRIMA 
study. This model is described in detail below and is termed the preliminary final model. 
•  Model #5. In the response to the concerns raised on Model #4, the MAH provided a slightly 
refined model (using the same data set as Model #4) which was termed the new final model. 
This model is described in the final section below.  
First updated model for the current application (Model #4) 
Objectives 
To update the existing popPK model for niraparib (i.e. Model #3), including the assessment of the sources 
of PK variability, using data from the PRIMA study. 
Estimation method 
Concentration-time data of niraparib were fitted using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling software 
(NONMEM, version 7.3.0)). All PK analyses were performed using the first-order conditional estimation 
method with interaction (FOCE-INTER) with the ADVAN12 subroutine. R version 3.5.3 was used for 
exposure response modelling. 
Data 
The previous data set was updated with data from the PRIMA study (the pivotal study supporting the 
current application). Once assembled, analysis-ready datasets underwent a formal quality control review 
by an analyst other than the data programmer. The quality control review included exploratory plots of 
the constructed data to identify potential errors.  
The study designs of the available PK data are shown below (Figure 1) and in Table 2.

Data exclusion prior to modelling 
In the full analysis dataset, there were a total of 8973 concentration records. Table 5 shows the number 
of concentration samples excluded from the analysis and the reasons for exclusion.

Table 5. Summary of excluded concentration samples 
In addition, concentration samples below quantification limit (BQL) (72 samples, <1% of total data set) 
were discarded. The final population PK analysis dataset consisted of 7418 quantifiable niraparib 
concentration measurements in 1442 subjects. Of these 1915 concentrations [26%] and 480 patients 
[33%] were from the PRIMA study. 
Outlier handling 
When the below base model structure was fit to all of the data, 41 (0.6 %) of the 7418 observations had 
|CWRES| >4 and were excluded from further analysis. Thus, the base model was developed from 7377 
quantifiable plasma niraparib concentrations. The final population PK model was re-run using the entire 
dataset. 
Structural model 
During development of the previous model (Model #3), prior to availability of the PRIMA data, a 3-
compartment model with linear elimination and a constant rate of drug release into the absorption 
compartment preceded by a time lag, with the drug released from the dosage form absorbed into the 
central compartment at a first-order rate (Figure 4) was selected as the final structural model. Briefly, 
this model provided a superior fit compared with the previous two-compartment model (Model #1 and 
#2), as evidenced by an OFV reduction of 157.6 units and an improvement in the CWRES versus time 
diagnostic plot (Figure 5). This model structure was adopted in the current analysis. Alternative 
absorption models were not considered because the PRIMA data primarily included only sparse sampling.

The inter-individual random effects on model parameters were modelled assuming a log-normal 
distribution. In the final model, BSV was included on CL/F, Ka, D1 (duration of zero-order release), 
bioavailability (Frel), and Vp2/F. The residual variability was best described using separate additive error 
components by study on log-transformed data.  
In the final base model, fixed-effect parameter estimates were also very similar to those from the 
previously developed base model (Table 6). All the parameters were precisely estimated, with relative 
standard errors (RSEs) less than 20%. The base model showed an adequate fit to the data (Figure 6, 
VPCs not provided).

Covariates – data and methodology 
Baseline characteristics for patients in the analysis dataset are summarized in Table 7. The vast majority 
(97.9%) were female and had ovarian cancer (96.1%). Most patients were White (88.0%). The pooled 
mean body weight was 70.8 kg (range 36-147 kg) and the mean age was 62 years (range 29-91 years).  
For missing continuous covariates, the median value was imputed. For missing categorical values, the 
most common category was imputed. If more than 10% of patients had missing values for a covariate, 
that covariate was excluded from the analysis.

Creatinine clearance was estimated using Cockcroft-Gault formula.  
Sources of variability in niraparib PK were investigated using a full model approach (as opposed to 
stepwise addition and elimination of covariates). A subset of covariate-parameter relationships from Table 
8 to be included in the full model were selected based on knowledge from previous analyses, clinical 
interest (defined as covariates for which there is a reasonable hypothesis of an effect on PK, and those 
which are frequently and commonly identified as covariates in pop-PK models) or statistically significant 
relationships in ETA versus covariate plots (in case shrinkage was <30% according to the modelling 
analysis plan). 
Table 9 summarises the covariates selected to be included in the Full model. After addition of these 
covariates, the OFV was decreased by 597 units compared to the base model. Covariates with small 
estimated effects were then removed.

As a final step, the full covariate model was reduced using a backward elimination procedure, using the 
likelihood ratio test to evaluate the significance of removing covariate effects from the population model 
based on a statistical significance level of 0.005 (Joerger 2012). According to the modelling analysis plan, 
covariate-parameter relationships that when removed resulted in an increase in OFV corresponding to 
p>0.005 were to be removed from the model unless retained for reasons of scientific or clinical interest. 
The results are shown in Table 10. All covariates shown in the table were retained, despite some being 
associated with a p-value above 0.005. 
Table 10. Summary of backward covariate elimination 
The inclusion of covariate effects decreased the BSV coefficient of variation (CV) for CL/F, Frel, and Vc/F 
by less than 5% and D1 by 16% when compared to the base model. The covariates NCRCL and body 
weight were moderately correlated (r=0.34, p<0.001).

that converged successfully (303 out of 700) and a comparison between the current preliminary final 
model and Model #3 are provided in Table 11. In general, the parameter estimates for the current model

Model refinement: New final model (Model #5) 
Due to concerns raised regarding the estimated impact of body weight (see discussion on clinical 
pharmacology), the preliminary final model was refined. 
Initially, the effect of body weight on bioavailability (F) was removed (OFV increased by 3.5 points, 
p=0.06). Fixing the exponents to allometric values (0.75 for CL/F, 1 for Vc/F) increased the OFV 
substantially (+168 points), and only estimated exponents were further tested. Then, removing body 
weight on CL/F increased the OFV by 0.27 points (p=0.61), while removing body weight on Vc/F 
increased the OFV by 37 points (p<0.001). The effect of body weight on CL/F was not significant and 
therefore removed. Finally, a model without body weight increased the OFV by 39 points, and an effect of 
body weight solely on Vc/F was retained. This model was selected as the new final model. 
The new final model achieved a successful covariance step and a condition number of 458, indicating that 
the model was stable.  
Except from the weight exponent on Vc/F estimated to 0.47, modestly higher than the previous estimate 
of 0.31, the remaining estimates were similar to those of the previous model (Model #4). Parameter 
estimates are presented in Table 12 and pcVPCs in Figure 9 and Figure 10. The prediction-corrected VPCs 
demonstrated good predictive performance for the PRIMA study over time and across the range of weight 
in the analysis dataset. 
The inter-individual variability in bioavailability was estimated to a coefficient of variation (CV) of 31%. 
The apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) was 1,311 L (based on a 70 kg patient) in cancer patients (CV 
116%), indicating extensive tissue distribution of niraparib. The apparent total clearance (CL/F) of 
niraparib was 16.5 L/h in cancer patients (CV 23.4%).

Special populations 
In the updated population PK models, body weight, age, albumin, BSA-standardised creatinine clearance 
and prandial state were identified as covariates influencing niraparib PK. Figure 11 shows a forest plot of 
the estimated effect of covariates on niraparib exposure (steady state AUC) over the range of covariate 
values represented in the data set, using Model #4.

Impaired renal function 
No dedicated study to investigate the impact of impaired renal function on niraparib pharmacokinetics has 
been performed. 
The updated population PK data set included patients with a median CRCL of 81 (range 28-236) mL/min. 
There were 232 patients (16.1%) with moderate renal impairment (CRCL 30-59 mL/min). Twenty-six 
patients (1.8%) had BSA-standardised CRCL (NCRCL) <40 mL/min/1.73 m2.  
There was a tendency to a relationship between BSA-normalised CRCL and CL/F in the ETA plot (Figure 
12) and BSA-normalised CRCL was included on CL/F in the final model as a power function with an 
estimated exponent of 0.23.

CL: 41%.  
Decreasing exposures of niraparib were predicted with increasing NCRCL, giving AUC ratios ranging from 
0.82 at the maximum of 198.7 mL/min/1.73 m2 to 1.24-fold at the minimum of 30.8 mL/min/1.73 m2 
than the reference value.

Impaired hepatic function 
No dedicated study to investigate the impact of impaired hepatic function on niraparib pharmacokinetics 
has been performed.

Table 10). According to the MAH, the extent of change in exposure with increasing age is minor.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
No new studies were submitted. 
Niraparib is an inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes, PARP-1 and PARP-2, which play 
a role in DNA repair. In vitro studies have shown that niraparib-induced cytotoxicity may involve 
inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity and increased formation of PARP-DNA complexes resulting in DNA 
damage, apoptosis and cell death. Increased niraparib-induced cytotoxicity was observed in tumour cell 
lines with or without deficiencies in the BReast CAncer (BRCA) 1 and 2 tumour suppressor genes. In 
orthotopic high-grade serous ovarian cancer patient-derived xenograft tumours (PDX) grown in mice, 
niraparib has been shown to reduce tumour growth in BRCA 1 and 2 mutant, BRCA wild-type but 
homologous recombination (HR) deficient, and in tumours that are BRCA wild-type and without detectable 
HR deficiency (see SmPC section 5.1). 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
No new primary or secondary PD studies were submitted in support of the current application.

Exposure-response relationships 
Efficacy 
Efficacy at the two dose levels tested (200 mg vs. 300 mg) is described and discussed in section “Clinical 
efficacy”. This section describes the exposure-efficacy relationship. 
Data 
A total of 480 PRIMA study patients randomised to niraparib treatment were available for exposure-
response analyses. The original analyses used the 17 May 2019 data cut date. The analyses presented 
below used the efficacy dataset updated to include 6 months of additional data (data cut date: 17 Nov 
2019) provided during the procedure. 
Summary statistics for covariates by exposure quartiles are provided for the total PRIMA population in

Exposure-efficacy relationship 
•  Efficacy outcome analysed: Progression-free survival (PFS) 
•  Exposure metric: Individual model-predicted steady-state exposures (AUCss) derived using the 
individual (post hoc) PK parameter estimates (CL/F and Frel) from the niraparib population PK 
model.  
o  The initial analysis presented by the MAH: Average concentration (Cave) up to the 
time of event, predicted using popPK Model #4 and analysed as a categorical covariate. 
Cave was approximated by multiplying the individual model-predicted steady-state 
exposure at the nominal dose of 200 or 300 mg QD by the relative dose intensity up to 
the time of first event/end of treatment/censoring. These results are not further 
presented in this report. 
o  The updated analysis provided during the procedure: AUCss associated with first 
dose, predicted using popPK Model #5, analysed as a continuous variable and with the 
updated efficacy data set (data cut date: 17 Nov 2019). These results are presented 
below. 
•  Analysis method: Exploratory by exposure quartiles and Cox proportional hazards modelling 
Evaluation of exposure metric 
In order to evaluate the reliability of the individual exposure metrics for exposure-response analysis, 
shrinkage for the PRIMA dataset was specifically calculated. In the sparsely sampled PK data from the 
PRIMA study, shrinkage values were high (calculated as described in Karlsson and Savic 2007) with 50% 
for CL/F and 47% for Frel. In addition, the following analysis was performed: An artificially sparse dataset 
was created with data from patients in phase 1 study PN001 using only the 2-h samples on Day 1 and the 
pre-dose and 2-h samples at steady state (i.e. mimicking the PK sampling in PRIMA). Post hoc estimates 
of the PK parameters for these subjects were obtained by using the sparse dataset as the input dataset, 
setting the initial estimates in the $THETA, $OMEGA, and $SIGMA blocks to the final estimates from the 
refined model, and setting MAXEVAL to 0. The rich PK samples from these patients were also used to 
perform a non-compartmental analysis (NCA) in Phoenix WinNonlin (version 8.2) and calculate AUC 
values. The linear up log down method was used. 
Overall, the NCA- and model-derived AUCss were similar for PN001 patients, as shown in Figure 16.

Dose reductions and exposure 
Although niraparib exposures at the beginning of treatment would be lower in the 200 mg ISD group 
relative to the 300 mg FSD group due to the lower dose, exposures were comparable over the course of 
treatment (Figure 17), consistent with a lower rate of dose reduction in the ISD dose groups.

The survival curves for all the exposure quartiles overlapped in the Kaplan-Meier plots for the non-
BRCAmut patients, and the p-values based on the log-rank test indicated no statistically significant 
exposure-response relationships for PFS in these groups (p ≥0.16). For the BRCAmut population (N = 
150), PFS was shorter in the two lower exposure groups compared to the higher exposure groups (p = 
0.027). There was no statistically significant difference between the survival curves for BRCAmut 
population patients who received a starting dose of 200 mg compared to those who received 300 mg (p = 
0.57; Figure 18).  
Modelling analysis 
Methods and results: A Cox proportional hazards model was used to model the exposure-response 
relationship between niraparib exposure and PFS. HRD status was the only covariate investigated in the 
updated analysis. A backward deletion step was performed for a model with AUCss and HRD status. The 
increase in -2×loglikelihood was statistically significant when the effect of HRD status was removed (p < 
0.0001), but not when AUCss was removed (p =0.1804). However, AUCss was retained in the model in 
order to investigate the potential exposure-response relationship. The estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 
95% CI are shown in Table 14.

The HR (95% CI) for median simulated AUCss of 200 mg (11.8 μg*h/mL) vs. 300 mg (17.5 μg*h/mL) is 
predicted to be 1.10 (0.943, 1.26), with a 95% CI including the null effect.

Model evaluation: The model was evaluated using Schoenfeld tests and Martingale residuals vs. 
covariates. 
Additional analysis in BRCAmut population 
As presented in the exploratory analyses above, the Kaplan-Meier plots for the BRCAmut population (N = 
150) stratified by AUCss quartiles suggested an exposure-response relationship for PFS. Therefore, the 
exposure-response relationship in the BRCAmut population was also investigated using a Cox proportional 
hazards model with AUCss as the only explanatory variable used in the model. The estimated HR (95% 
CI; p-value) for AUCss was 0.911 (0.858 - 0.967; p = 0.0021), indicating a statistically significant 
exposure-response relationship, with higher exposures associated with improved PFS in the BRCAmut 
population.

Summary statistics for the frequency of Grade 3+ thrombocytopenia and baseline characteristics are 
provided in Table 15. Grade 3+ thrombocytopenia was more frequent in PRIMA (48.4%) compared to 
NOVA (33.8%), and AUCss were slightly lower in NOVA. The remaining evaluated baseline characteristics 
had similar distributions in both studies.

Univariate analyses 
Exploratory univariate logistic regression plots with AUCss, weight, and baseline platelet count (PLT) 
indicated that the probability of Grade 3+ thrombocytopenia increased with increasing niraparib exposure 
and decreased with increasing weight and PLT (Figure 20). The effect of PLT appeared to be less 
pronounced than the effects of exposure and weight.

Multivariate analysis 
A full model was run with the following explanatory variables: AUCss, weight, PLT and age (all 
continuous), and ECOG performance status (serving as a surrogate for comorbidities) as a categorical 
covariate. Backward deletion was then performed, using an increase in AIC of any amount as the criterion 
for deletion. During backward deletion, age and ECOG performance status dropped out of the model. The 
model arising from this step was considered the final exposure-response model for Grade 3+ 
thrombocytopenia and included AUCss, weight, and PLT as explanatory variables. The final model 
equation was: 
Parameter estimates and odds ratios for the final model are presented in Table 16. The coefficients for 
AUCss, weight, PLT were statistically significant (p ≤0.0062). The model predicts that the probability of 
Grade 3+ thrombocytopenia increases with increasing AUCss, decreasing weight, and decreasing PLT, 
consistent with the exploratory plots.

Model predictions of benefit of dose reduction 
The final model was used to predict the probability of Grade 3+ thrombocytopenia for different dosing 
regimens and patient groups to investigate the potential benefit of the individualized starting dose: i.e. 
reducing the starting dose from 300 mg to 200 mg for patients with low WT (WT <77 kg) and/or low PLT 
(<150,000/μL). For the predictions, the median simulated AUCss were used as estimates of 200 mg and 
300 mg exposures (11.8 and 17.5 ug*h/mL, respectively). The median WT and PLT values among PRIMA 
patients in the respective weight and platelet groups were used as representative values (with low WT 
and low PLT defined as above and high WT and high PLT defined as WT ≥77 kg and PLT ≥150,000/μL, 
respectively). The probability predictions are tabulated in Table 17. 
In every case, equivalent WT and PLT patient groups had substantially lower predicted probability of 
Grade 3+ thrombocytopenia for the 200 mg starting dose compared to 300 mg. Patients with low WT or 
low PLT (Groups A1 to A3) receiving the 300 mg dose were predicted to have a probability ranging from 
35.9% to 53.9%. When these patients receive the lower starting dose of 200 mg, the probability of Grade 
3+ thrombocytopenia was predicted to decrease (probabilities ranging from 21.9% to 36.9%), with 95% 
CIs that did not overlap or overlapped minimally. Therefore, lowering the starting dose to 200 mg for 
subjects with low WT or low PLT was predicted to reduce the incidence of Grade 3+ thrombocytopenia.

values and dosing strategies. Source: First RSI response, Table 28.

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Niraparib is currently approved as maintenance treatment of adult patients with platinum-sensitive 
recurrent ovarian cancer who are in response to second-line or greater platinum-based chemotherapy. 
The applied indication is for patients with the same diagnoses, but as first-line maintenance treatment.  
The currently approved starting dose for niraparib monotherapy is 300 mg for all patients, taken orally 
once daily. In the registrational study NOVA, doses were reduced over the first 3 cycles based on 
individual tolerance, and this reduced the incidence and severity TEAEs in patients enabling them to 
continue on a sustained maintenance treatment. At Cycle 12, of the 163 patients remaining on niraparib 
treatment in the NOVA study, only 37 patients (23%) remained on a daily dose of 300 mg with the 
remaining patients at either 200 mg (n=65, 40%) or 100 mg (n=61, 37%). Dose reduction reduced 
Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia from 36% during Month 1 to <1% after Month 3. It was therefore suggested 
that a lower dose may improve the benefit-risk balance of niraparib, emphasising that the treatment is 
maintenance treatment and that reducing the adverse event burden is of high importance. A variation 
application was submitted in 2019 (EMEA/H/004249/II/0006, variation withdrawn) in order to change the 
posology in the currently approved indication. Retrospective, exploratory statistical multivariable analysis 
of the NOVA data was used to investigate predictors of Grade 3 thrombocytopenia. Low body weight and 
low baseline platelet count were identified as predictors of thrombocytopenia, which is one of the most 
frequent adverse events, and an alternative dosing algorithm based on these factors was proposed. The 
proposed dosing algorithm implied that ~75% of the target population will receive a lower starting dose 
(200 mg QD), while the remaining patients will still receive 300 mg (if they fulfil both the criteria of a 
body weight ≥77 kg and a normal baseline platelet count [≥150,000/µL]). This posology change, 
however, was not considered acceptable by the CHMP because there was no prospective data to confirm 
maintained efficacy at this alternative dose. Furthermore, the proposed dosing algorithm was questioned 
because body weight and platelet count did not influence the PK or PD of niraparib. The MAH was 
encouraged to also consider other dosing strategies using more recognised and comprehensive 
pharmacometrics methodology.  
In the present application, the MAH has prospectively tested the dosing algorithm described above, 
without further refining it. Exposure-response analyses have been proposed as supplementary evidence 
of maintained efficacy at the 200 mg starting dose.

The application encompasses an updated population PK model based on a large data set from multiple 
studies, including the sparsely collected PK data from the PRIMA study, in addition to exposure-response 
modelling for efficacy and safety end points.  
Analytical methods used in PRIMA study are considered acceptable. With regards to the PopPK modelling, 
standard and adequate methodology was used.  
A three-compartment model with linear elimination and a constant rate of drug release into the 
absorption compartment preceded by a time lag and first-order absorption was used to describe the data.  
The base model parameter estimates were similar to those of a previously established base model, 
indicating that the PK in the current indication is similar to the PK in previous indications. Inter-occasion 
variability has not been estimated. The shrinkage in all parameters was high (>30% for all parameters, 
41.4% for CL/F). This is expected based on the very sparse PK sampling in the majority of patients. Due 
to high shrinkage, the individually predicted parameters are not considered reliable and not appropriate 
for Empirical Bayes Estimate (EBE)-based diagnostics (e.g. covariate vs. ETA plots).  
In final model (Model #5) the following covariates were identified: age, albumin and BSA-normalised 
creatinine clearance on apparent clearance, and body weight on volume of distribution. Prandial state was 
included as a covariate on the duration of drug release prior to absorption. None of the covariates were 
deemed to impact on exposure to an extent that would warrant dose adjustment in any special 
population. The popPK model adequately and reliably described the data as judged by a range of standard 
model diagnostic techniques, including prediction-corrected visual predictive checks. For completeness, 
the MAH is recommended to update the modelling report with the most recent results and also include a 
backward elimination procedure for the final covariate selection, a procedure to determine the parameter 
uncertainty for the refined model parameter estimates (e.g. bootstrap), and an updated forest plot for the 
impact of covariates at the covariate ranges. The report should also be updated with the most recent 
exposure-response modelling results (recommendation). The MAH informed that an updated population 
PK and exposure-response report will be submitted when available, estimated to occur by 30 September 
2021.  
Regarding special populations, clinical studies investigating the impact of renal impairment on niraparib 
PK have not been submitted. The effect of renal impairment was studied in the population 
pharmacokinetic analyses using creatinine clearance as a marker for renal function. In contrast to 
previous popPK analyses, creatinine clearance was identified as a covariate in the updated modelling. 
Patients with mild (creatinine clearance 60-90 ml/min) and moderate (30-60 mL/min) renal impairment 
had mildly reduced niraparib clearance compared to individuals with normal renal function (7-17% higher 
exposure in mild and 17-38% higher exposure in moderate renal impairment). However, the difference in 
exposure is not considered to warrant dose adjustment for patients with reduced renal function. This is 
reflected in section 5.2. of the SmPC. 
There is no formal study of niraparib in subjects with hepatic impairment. Hepatic impairment has not 
been identified as a covariate in previous modelling exercises of niraparib and was not tested in the 
modelling performed for this application.  
With regards to gender, it cannot be expected to identify a potential underlying effect of gender on 
niraparib PK considering the small number of male subjects in the data set (2%). The effect of gender is 
therefore unknown. Considering the target population, this is acceptable. 
There is insufficient data across races to conclude on the impact of race on niraparib pharmacokinetics. 
According to the box plots of etaCL in the limited number of subjects of other races, there is no tendency 
towards a race-related difference. However, this plot is limited by high shrinkage. Therefore, it is 
concluded that the effect of race on niraparib PK is unknown and the SmPC has been updated 
accordingly.  
Assessment report  
EMA/531223/2020

The updated popPK modelling identified a significant relationship between age and niraparib CL/F. 
Increasing age was found to decrease niraparib clearance (after accounting for the impact of renal 
function). The average exposure in a 91-year old patient was predicted to be 23% higher than in a 30-
year old patient. Age was not tested as a covariate on volume of distribution in the model. Based on 
these results, it is not considered warranted to suggest posology changes based on age. However, section 
5.2 of the SmPC has been updated with the new results.  
The effect of albumin on plasma-based CL/F was consistent with that niraparib is moderately protein 
bound (83%) in plasma, mainly to albumin. It is not expected that differences in albumin leads to 
differences in unbound niraparib exposure. Therefore, the model-predicted changes according to changes 
in serum albumin are not expected to be clinically relevant and do not warrant dose adjustment.  
As mentioned above, the estimated impact of body weight is of special interest because the proposed 
dose regimen implies the use of different doses for patients below and above 77 kg (and also according to 
platelet count). Increasing weight was found to increase niraparib volume of distribution in the population 
pharmacokinetic analysis. No impact of weight was identified on niraparib clearance or overall exposure. 
No difference in exposure (AUCss) across the body weight range for fixed dose administration is 
predicted, and with the proposed posology, exposure is predicted to be 50% higher in patients with body 
weight ≥77 kg (and normal platelet count). There is no clear reason for targeting different exposures in 
these subgroups and dose adjustment according to body weight is not warranted from a pharmacokinetic 
point of view. The proposed dosing algorithm therefore does not seem justified from a clinical 
pharmacology viewpoint.  
Exposure-response relationship  
Summary statistics for covariates by exposure quartiles were provided for the total PRIMA population. 
The distribution of covariates across each AUCss quartile was mostly similar. The patients in the highest 
exposure quartile tended to be older, which is in line with decreasing niraparib CL/F with increasing age. 
Notably, BRCA status and HRD status was not evenly distributed, with ~28% HRD negative subjects in 
the two lower exposure quartiles vs. 48% in the highest exposure quartile. As HRD status is highly 
predictive of clinical outcomes, this uneven distribution would confound the results. The exposure-
response results were therefore also presented in subgroups according to BRCA/HRD status in addition to 
the analysis on the overall population. 
The MAH initially primarily explored the relationship between exposure quartiles based on average 
concentration (Cave) up to the time of progression/death or censoring and PFS (data not shown). 
However, this exposure metric is not considered appropriate because of a high frequency of dose 
reductions in the PRIMA study (~80%). Conceptually, patients with short PFS due to early death or 
disease progression will be less likely to have a dose reduction (and therefore tend to have a high Cave in 
the analysis), while patients with long PFS are more likely to have a dose reduction during the course of 
the study, and therefore tend to have lower Cave values. Updated analyses using exposure associated 
with the first dose were therefore provided and led to the following overall conclusions: 
- In the overall population and in the non-BRCA patients, there is no tendency of an exposure-response 
relationship across the exposure range tested. However, the absence of a relationship in the overall 
population could be confounded by uneven distribution of BRCA/HRD status across the AUCss range 
(Table 13).  
- In the BRCA mutated population specifically, which represents a subgroup of 31% of the overall 
population, the Kaplan-Meier plot indicated an apparent exposure-response relationship, and modelling 
identified AUCss as a significant predictor of PFS. The model-estimated HR between average predicted 
exposures at 200 mg vs. 300 mg. was 0.49. This indicates that in this subpopulation, an exposure-
response relationship could be present over the relevant dose range. However, these results are

contrasting the results of the dose-efficacy analyses, in which similar efficacy for the two starting doses 
was seen in the HRD positive patients, but not in the HRD negative patients (See Clinical efficacy 
section). The MAH provided no explanation to these conflicting results. 
Taken together, it is considered that the refined analyses provide some reassurance that there are likely 
no major differences in treatment effects at the two dose levels under comparison. However, there are 
still limitations in the input data, including extensive parameter shrinkage (50% in CL/F and F) due to 
very sparse PK sampling in the PRIMA study leading to potentially inaccurate exposure predictions, 
narrow exposure range due to the use of only two dose starting dose levels (with the majority at 300 mg) 
in the data set used for analysis, and frequent dose adjustments during the study which further narrows 
the actually studied exposure range. Moreover, there are conflicting results between the various dose- 
and exposure-based sub-analyses performed. Therefore, the results should be interpreted with caution, 
and although some reassurance could be derived from these analyses, they provide only limited 
supplementary evidence for maintained efficacy at 200 mg. 
The refined exposure-safety model predicted approximately 15 percentage points reduction in the risk of 
Grade 3+ thrombocytopenia when reducing the starting dose from 300 mg to 200 mg, which is 
considered a clinically meaningful reduction. The modelling also identified body weight and baseline 
platelet count as independent and significant predictors of Grade 3+ thrombocytopenia, which is the 
MAH’s rationale for dosing by these factors despite not being determinants of AUCss. It should be noted 
that the dosing algorithm is purely data-driven and lacks pharmacological or biological rationale. It also 
showed poor performance in terms of identifying patients who will tolerate the 300 mg dose, as most of 
the patients meeting the criteria of receiving the 300 mg starting dose required a dose reduction. If 
adequate treatment effect at the exposure associated with 200 mg could be firmly concluded, there would 
be no clear pharmacological reason not to allow all patients to benefit from the lower starting dose, 
independently of their body weight and platelet count. However, with the remaining efficacy uncertainties 
at 200 mg (see clinical efficacy section), it could be argued that the presumed thrombocytopenia risk (as 
predicted by body weight and platelet count) should determine whether the benefits of reducing the 
starting dose outweighs the risk of potential efficacy loss. Still, the specific threshold values of 77 kg and 
150,000/µL for discriminating between starting doses has not been well justified, and there is no 
convincing scientific basis for selecting these exact values. The dosing strategy could probably be further 
optimized, for example by dosing based on HRD or BRCA mutation status. It is biologically plausible that 
drug sensitivity may be higher in HRD positive subjects, and dose requirement to achieve adequate 
efficacy may thereby be lower in these patients. This, however, was not pursued as there is currently no 
available test for HRD status in the EU (see Clinical efficacy section). 
Despite its limited pharmacological basis, the proposed posology is considered acceptable as it seems to 
be the best option among the posology strategies that have been prospectively tested. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The systemic exposure (AUCss) of niraparib is influenced by prandial state, age and renal function, while 
body weight has no impact on AUCss. The pharmacokinetics of niraparib does not support dosing by any 
of the studied patient characteristics, including the body weight and platelet count criteria included in the 
proposed posology. 
The risk of Grade 3+ thrombocytopenia is reduced when lowering the starting dose from 300 mg to 
200 mg. The risk is also reduced with increasing body weight or increasing baseline platelet count. This 
provides some rationale for differentiating the starting dose by these factors as long as efficacy is not 
confidently established at the 200 mg starting dose. However, the scientific basis for selecting the exact 
threshold values of 77 kg and 150,000/uL, respectively, is limited.

The exposure-response analyses for efficacy indicated a flat relationship across the exposures associated 
with 200 mg to 300 mg. These results are uncertain due to limitations in the exposure input data and 
provide only limited supportive evidence of maintained efficacy at the 200 mg starting dose (see also 
discussion on clinical efficacy).

Study PR-30-5017-C (PRIMA) 
PRIMA study is a double-blind, multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled 2:1 (niraparib:placebo) study 
in patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, collectively referred to as ovarian 
cancer. To be eligible for the study, participants must have achieved a complete or partial response to 
front-line platinum-based regimen. Subjects who had received primary debulking surgery (PDS), 
intraperitoneal chemotherapy (IHEC), or neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) were eligible.  
A schema over the study design is provided in the figure below.

Note 1: Per Protocol Amendment 2, the starting dose of study treatment was based upon the subject’s baseline body 
weight or baseline platelet count. Subjects with a baseline body weight ≥77 kg and baseline platelet count 
≥150,000/μL were to receive 300 mg; subjects with a baseline body weight <77 kg or baseline platelet count 
<150,000/μL were to receive 200 mg. 
Note 2: Treatment was continuous (in 28-day cycles) until subject discontinued. Post-treatment follow-up was 
continuous (every 12 weeks) until subject discontinued study. 
All subjects must have received at least 6 and no more than 9 cycles of frontline or neoadjuvant/adjuvant 
platinum-based therapy (including at least 2 post-operative cycles of platinum-based therapy after 
interval debulking surgery), with a physician-assessed response of CR or PR after at least 3 cycles of 
therapy. 
Subjects who were randomised to placebo were not allowed to cross over to the niraparib arm at any time 
during the study.

6. Subjects agreed to undergo central tumour homologous recombination deficiency testing. 
a. The central homologous recombination deficiency test result was required for randomisation as it was a 
stratification factor. Subjects with documented gBRCA1 or gBRCA2 mutation or sBRCA1/2 mutation by local

screening period if it appeared the subject was likely to meet other eligibility requirements. Subjects were not 
required to have repeat homologous recombination deficiency testing if the result was “not determined” (e.g., 
due to insufficient tumour specimen). 
c. Subjects with known homologous recombination deficiency test results from any commercially available 
sources including Myriad Genetics were allowed to participate in the study; however, they were required to 
submit a tumour sample for central homologous recombination deficiency testing. The results of the central 
homologous recombination deficiency testing must have been available prior to randomisation and used for

18. Subject had known brain or leptomeningeal metastases that were untreated or uncontrolled (i.e., new or 
worsening symptom or signs, or unstable steroid requirements); 
Note: A scan to confirm the absence of brain metastases was not required. Subjects with spinal cord 
compression may have been be considered if they had received definitive treatment for this and demonstrate 
evidence of clinically stable disease for 28 days. 
19. Subject was considered a poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical disorder, non-malignant

21. Subject had known active hepatic disease (i.e., hepatitis B or C). 
22. Subject had a corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation >480 milliseconds at screening; 
Note: If a subject had a prolonged QTc interval and the prolongation was deemed to be due to a pacemaker 
upon Investigator evaluation (i.e., the subject otherwise had no cardiac abnormalities), then the subject may 
have been eligible to participate in the study following discussion with the Medical Monitor. 
Testing of HRD status 
Testing for HRD was performed using the HRD test on tumour tissue obtained at the time of initial 
diagnosis. For all potentially eligible subjects, a tumour sample was sent for centralized homologous 
recombination deficiency testing. To facilitate the screening and enrolment process, the samples could be 
sent in advance of the protocol-defined screening period. The central homologous recombination 
deficiency test result was required for randomisation as it was a stratification factor. This result had to be 
available prior to randomisation and used for stratification. Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) 
status was determined at screening by tumour samples via the clinical trial assay based on the myChoice 
homologous recombination deficiency test (Myriad Genetics, Inc.). The test is an integrated genome-
based assay for homologous recombination that quantitates genomic instability of the tumour and, in 
parallel, detects and classifies variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2. Tumours were identified as positive by this 
test if they harboured deleterious or suspected deleterious mutations in BRCA-1 or -2 or if the combined 
genomic instability scoring (based on large-scale state transitions [LST], telomeric-allelic imbalance [TAI], 
and loss of heterozygosity [LOH]) was ≥42. The homologous recombination deficiency score represents a 
continuum of genomic instability accumulated over time in the tumour.  
Tumours with a negative test result had neither of these characteristics (neither BRCAmut nor 
homologous recombination deficiency score ≥42). If test results were inconclusive or the test was not 
done, tumours were considered as homologous recombination status not determined. 
Treatments 
Patients were administered niraparib or placebo (matched in appearance) using 100 mg capsules orally 
QD during continuous 28-day cycles in a double-blind fashion. At the time of study initiation (01 
December 2016), all subjects received 300 mg as the starting dose. On 16 November 2017, the protocol 
was amended to change the starting dose of study treatment to either 300 mg or 200 mg based upon the 
subject’s baseline body weight and/or baseline platelet count, see table below. 
Assessment report  
EMA/531223/2020 
Page 59/168 
 
 
  
  
 
Table 18. Recommended initial starting dose
Study treatment was dispensed to subjects on Cycle 1/Day 1 and every cycle (28 days) thereafter until 
the subject discontinued study treatment. The first dose was administered at the site. 
Dose modification 
At the Investigator’s discretion, dose interruption and/or reduction could have been implemented at any 
time for any grade toxicity considered intolerable by the subject. Treatment was required to be 
interrupted for any non-hematologic AE that was Grade 3 or 4 per the NCI-CTCAE (v4.03) that the 
Investigator considered to be related to administration of study treatment. If Grade 3 or 4 non-
hematologic toxicity was appropriately resolved to baseline or Grade 1 or less within 28 days of 
interruption, the subject was allowed to restart study treatment but with a dose level reduction if 
prophylaxis was not considered feasible. If the event recurred at a similar or worse grade, treatment was 
interrupted again; upon event resolution, a further dose reduction was required. 
For subjects whose starting dose was 3 capsules daily (300 mg/day), dose reductions to 2 capsules daily 
(200 mg/day) and subsequently to 1 capsule daily (100 mg/day) were allowed. No further dose reduction 
was allowed without discussion with the Medical Monitor. For subjects whose starting dose was 2 capsules 
(200 mg/day), dose reduction to 1 capsule once daily (100 mg/day) was allowed. No further dose 
reduction was allowed without discussion with the Medical Monitor. 
Additional dose modifications of study treatment were not based upon changes in the subject’s body 
weight during study participation. For subjects whose initial starting dose was 2 capsules (200 mg/day), 
escalation to 3 capsules once daily was permitted if no treatment interruption or discontinuation was 
required during the first 2 cycles of therapy. For any dose modification, the number of capsules 
administered were modified accordingly. 
If the toxicity requiring dose interruption had not resolved completely or to CTCAE Grade 1 during the 
maximum 4-week (28-day) dose interruption period, and/or the subject had already undergone the 
maximum number of dose reductions, the subject was required to permanently discontinue study 
treatment. 
The dose interruption/modification criteria for hematologic parameters was based on blood counts.  
If the hematologic toxicity did not recover to specified levels within 4 weeks (28 days) of the dose 
interruption period, and/or the subject had already undergone the maximum number of dose reductions, 
the subject was required to permanently discontinue study treatment.  
If dose interruption or modification was required at any point on study because of hematologic toxicity, 
weekly blood draws for complete blood count (CBC) were monitored until the AE resolved. To ensure 
safety of the new dose, weekly blood draws for CBC were also required for an additional 4 weeks after the 
AE resolved to the specified levels, after which monitoring every 4 weeks may have been resumed. 
Any subject requiring transfusion of platelets or red blood cells (1 or more units) or hematopoietic growth 
factor support was required to undergo a dose reduction upon recovery if study treatment was resumed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/531223/2020

If a subject was diagnosed with MDS/AML (confirmed by a hematologist) or secondary cancer (new 
malignancies other than MDS/AML) while on study, the subject was required to permanently discontinue 
study treatment. 
If a subject had major surgery while on treatment, up to 28 days of study treatment interruption was 
allowed. Once the dose of study treatment was reduced, any re-escalation was discussed with the Medical 
Monitor. 
No other anticancer therapy was permitted during the course of the study treatment for any subject. 
Palliative radiotherapy (excluding the pelvic region and/or palliative radiotherapy encompassing >20% of 
the bone marrow within 1 week of the first dose of study treatment) was allowed for pre-existing small 
areas of painful metastases that could not be managed with local or systemic analgesics, as long as no 
evidence of disease progression was present. Prophylactic cytokines (granulocyte colony-stimulating 
factor) were not administered in the first cycle of the study but may have been administered in 
subsequent cycles according to local guidelines.  
Objectives 
Primary objective 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of niraparib versus placebo as 
maintenance treatment, as measured by PFS, in subjects with Stage III or IV ovarian cancer (including

treatment. 
Secondary objectives 
1. To evaluate additional measures of clinical benefit for niraparib versus placebo as maintenance 
treatment, such as OS (key secondary endpoint), patient-reported outcomes (PROs), outcomes for next 
anticancer therapy following study treatment, time to first subsequent therapy (TFST), time to 
progression on the next anticancer therapy (PFS2) and time to CA-125 progression; 
2. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of niraparib versus placebo.

who had an initial response to front-line platinum therapy. 
Schedule of events 
Visits were scheduled weekly during the first cycle and then on Day 1 (every 4 weeks +/- 3 days) for each 
subsequent cycle. 
Radiologic determination of disease progression 
Determination of response to treatment/progression of disease by central blinded review was based on 
imaging assessments according to RECIST v1.1. 
Clinical determination of disease progression 
Clinical disease progression might have been determined if 1 of the following 2 criteria were met: 
1. CA-125 progression according to Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG)-criteria AND additional 
diagnostic tests (e.g., histology/cytology, ultrasound techniques, endoscopy, PET) may identify new lesions 
or determine existing lesions qualify for unequivocal PD; 
2. CA-125 progression according to GCIG criteria AND definitive clinical signs and symptoms of PD 
unrelated to non-malignant or iatrogenic causes, such as: 
a. intractable cancer-related pain; 
b. malignant bowel obstruction/worsening dysfunction; or 
Assessment report  
EMA/531223/2020 
Page 62/168 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
c. unequivocal symptomatic worsening of ascites or pleural effusion. 
An elevation in CA-125 without accompanying radiological changes or clinical symptoms/signs consistent 
with PD were not considered disease progression. 
Central disease response assessment 
Blinded independent central review (BICR) was established to assess study imaging and available clinical 
data to determine overall tumour assessment for each patient at each time point for the primary analysis 
of PFS. BICR consisted of a primary radiologic assessment (conducted by two independent radiologists) 
for all patients followed by review by an independent oncologist on cases for which progression based on 
RECIST 1.1 criteria had not been confirmed during the radiologic assessment. In the event that the 
primary radiologic assessments did not agree, a third radiologist was to adjudicate by selecting one of the 
radiology review assessments in its entirety. Radiographic assessments were conducted according to 
RECIST v1.1 tumour assessment via CT or MRI scan of the abdomen/pelvis and other areas as clinically 
indicated. Assessments were conducted at screening, then every 12 weeks (± 7 days) from Cycle 1/Day 1 
visit until progression was confirmed by BICR. CA-125 evaluations were required at the end of every cycle 
(4 weeks ±3 days) until PD was centrally confirmed.  
Cycle timing was not modified/delayed for treatment interruptions and tumour assessment continued 
according to the established schedule, regardless of whether study treatment was interrupted. If a 
subject discontinued treatment for a reason other than PD or death, withdrawal of consent, or loss to 
follow up, scans and CA 125 testing were expected to continue at the specified intervals until disease 
progression was confirmed or until the start of subsequent anticancer treatment. All subjects were 
followed off treatment every 12 weeks for assessment of next anticancer therapy, evaluation of any 
subsequent malignancies and for survival status. 
Determination of the date of PD was made by central blinded review as outlined in the table below.  
Table 19. Determination of disease progression date
PRO data were collected every 8 weeks (± 7 days) for 56 weeks beginning on Cycle 1/Day 1, then every 
12 weeks (± 7 days) while on study treatment. During the follow-up period; PRO assessments occurred 
at 4, 8, 12 and 24 weeks (± 1 week for each time point) regardless of the status of subsequent 
treatment.

Sample size 
The sample size calculations were based on PFS in the HRDpos group and an event-based analysis. 
Assuming a median PFS of 21 months for the HRDpos placebo group, a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.5, 90% 
power, one-sided alpha of 0.025, and a 2:1 randomisation ratio, it was calculated that 99 PFS events 
were needed. Further assuming that 50% randomised patients were HRDpos it was calculated that 
620 patients (310 HRDpos) would be needed to enrol to complete the study in 44 months.  
The final analysis of PFS for HRDpos and ITT population was to be performed sequentially after 
approximately 99 HRDpos PFS events are reached. The PFS analysis in the ITT population was to include 
all PFS events observed at the time of the final analysis. Assuming a median PFS of 14 months for all 
placebo patients, a total of approximately 270 PFS events were expected for the final analysis of PFS in 
the ITT population. This was expected to provide at least 90% power to detect a true HR of 0.65. 
Type-I error control at a one-sided alpha of  0.025 was achieved by employing hierarchical testing of first 
the primary endpoint, PFS in the HRDpos population, followed sequentially by the same test in the entire 
ITT population, then by OS in the ITT population, and finally OS in the HRDpos population. The analysis of 
OS was to include an interim analysis of OS at the time of the final PFS analysis and a final analysis of OS 
when approximately 440 deaths have occurred in the ITT population (60% data maturity). A Lan-DeMets 
alpha-spending function with the O’Brien-Fleming stopping boundaries was used to determine the 
significance levels for interim and final OS analyses. The final analysis of OS is expected to occur 
approximately 70 months after first patient randomized. 
Randomisation 
Eligible patients were randomised to treatment with niraparib or placebo in a 2:1 (niraparib:placebo) ratio 
using an interactive web response system. In the Original Protocol, patients had to be HRDpos and were 
randomised by one stratification factor: best response to platinum therapy (CR or PR). Since Protocol 
Amendment 1, patients were randomised by three stratification factors: best response to platinum 
therapy (CR or PR), administration of neoadjuvant therapy (Yes or No), and HRD status (HRDpos or 
HRDneg/HRDnd).  
Blinding (masking) 
The patient, Investigator, study staff, and the Sponsor study team and its representatives were blinded to 
the patients’ tumor HRD status and identity of the assigned treatment from the time of randomization 
until database lock. If an individual’s role on the trial requires information about HRD status or treatment 
assignment (e.g., an individual is involved in emergency un-blinding or entry of HRD status for 
stratification), procedures were in place to ensure all other personnel remained blinded.  
Statistical methods 
Analysis populations  
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population was defined as all patients randomised into the study and was the 
primary analysis population for the efficacy analysis. For this analysis, patients were analysed as 
randomised. Patients who were incorrectly stratified during randomisation will be analysed and presented 
under the stratum assigned during randomisation.  
The Per-protocol (PP) population was defined as all patients randomised and treated in the study who do 
not have protocol deviations that could significantly impact the interpretation of efficacy results. Patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/531223/2020

were analysed according to the treatment they actually received. Patients who were incorrectly stratified 
during randomisation was analysed and presented under the correct stratum based on the clinical 
database.  
The Safety (SAF) population was defined as all patients who receive at least 1 dose of study drug. 
Patients were analysed as treated. Patients receiving treatment from more than one treatment arm will 
be accounted for based on their first study treatment.  
Primary endpoint analysis 
The primary endpoint, PFS by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), was tested hierarchically first 
in the HRDpos population and then in the ITT population by a stratified log-rank test at a one-sided 0.025 
alpha level. The stratification factors were the ones used at randomization; administration of neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy (yes or no) and best response to platinum therapy (CR or PR), for the HRDpos population 
test. For the test in the ITT population, HRD status (HRDpos or HRDneg/HRDnd) was an additional 
stratification factor. The hazard ratio with 2-sided 95% CI was estimated using a stratified Cox 
proportional hazards model with the above-described stratification factors.  
Censoring of PFS events was done for patients without baseline or with no evaluable post-baseline 
radiological assessments, patients who did not progress or die, patients who started subsequent anti-
cancer therapy, and patients who progressed or died after two or more missed radiological assessments.  
Sensitivity analyses for PFS included using Investigator assessed progression instead of BICR data, not 
censoring patients starting new anti-cancer therapy or progressing after two missed assessments, using 
stratification factors from eCRF instead of from randomization, using the mid-point between progression 
time and previous assessment for unscheduled assessments, using only BICR radiology data, analysing in 
the per-protocol population, considering new anti-cancer therapy as an event, and not stratifying for 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  
The following subgroup analyses were performed on the BICR data in HRDpos and ITT population: 
•  Age categories [<65 or ≥65] 
•  Race [White or non-White] 
•  ECOG performance status [0 or 1] 
•  Stage of disease at initial diagnosis [III or IV] 
• 
Primary tumour site [ovarian, primary peritoneal, fallopian tube] 
•  Neoadjuvant chemotherapy [yes or no], according to randomization 
•  Best response to first platinum regimen [CR or PR], according to randomization 
•  Neoadjuvant chemotherapy [yes or no], according to eCRF 
•  Best response to first platinum regimen [CR or PR], according to eCRF 
•  Baseline CA-125 level [≤ULN or >ULN] 
•  Region [North America or Rest of World] 
•  Starting dose subgroup [Fixed Starting Dose or Individualized Starting Dose]

Key secondary efficacy analysis 
If a statistically significant PFS treatment difference was observed in the ITT population, the sequential 
testing was to continue for OS endpoint first in the ITT population and then in HRDpos population. The 
analysis of OS was to include an interim analysis of OS at the time of the final analysis of PFS and a final 
analysis of OS when approximately 440 deaths have occurred in the ITT population (60% data maturity). 
A Lan-DeMets alpha-spending function with the O’BrienFleming stopping boundaries was to be used to 
determine the significance levels for interim and final analyses based on the observed fraction of OS 
events [8]. The final analysis of OS is expected to occur approximately 70 months after first patient 
randomized. To detect a statistically significant OS treatment difference at 1-sided 0.025 Type I error, the 
analysis of OS with 440 events will have at least 80% power if the true HR is 0.75 or less in the ITT 
population. Although this study was not powered for OS analysis in HRDpos population, about one third of 
deaths in the ITT population were estimated to be HRDpos patients at the time of final analysis of OS, 
thus the analysis of OS with 150 HRDpos events will have at least 70% power if the true HR is 0.65 or 
less in HRDpos population. 
The following subgroup analyses were to be performed for OS: 
•  Neoadjuvant chemotherapy [yes or no], according to the eCRF 
•  Best response to first platinum regimen [CR or PR], according to the eCRF 
•  Region [North America or Rest of World] 
•  Starting dose subgroup [Fixed Starting Dose or Individualized Starting Dose]

Table 20. Summary of subject disposition in the PRIMA study (all enrolled subjects) (17 May 
2019) 
A total of 989 subjects were screened, and of these 733 subjects were randomised into the PRIMA trial 
and constituted the ITT population. There were 256 screening failures. Data were missing for 22/256 (~ 
9%) patients. Most screening failures were due to the patient not meeting the clinical or laboratory 
inclusion criteria. Of the 234 patients for whom data were available, the majority of patients (62/234; 
26%) failed due to lack of “having either CA-125 in the normal range or CA-125 decreased by more than 
90% during their frontline therapy that was stable for more than 7 days”. 
Fixed and individualised starting dose groups 
As per Protocol Amendment 2, analyses summarised by starting dose group for subjects with homologous 
recombination deficient tumours and all randomised subjects (Overall population) were included. The 
table below summarises the disposition of subjects with homologous recombination deficient tumours 
(HRDpos) and Overall by fixed and individualised dose.

Table 21. Summary of subject disposition by fixed and individualised starting dose subgroups 
(all enrolled subjects) 
A total of 473 subjects (315 niraparib, 158 placebo) received the 300 mg starting dose (nominated “fixed 
starting dose”) prior to the change of dosing strategy (Amendment 2 of the protocol), while 255 subjects 
(169 niraparib, 86 placebo) received the individualised dosing scheme (of note, this number encompasses 
both patients receiving 200 mg and those receiving 300 mg as their individualised starting dose and 
regardless of baseline bodyweight and platelet count and all of these patients will therefore not have been 
dosed in accordance with the algorithm recommended by the MAH).  
Of the 315 niraparib patients who received the fixed dose of 300 mg, it was shown that it was only 72 
patients (~23%) who fulfilled the requirements of the high body weight and high platelet count algorithm 
while 243 patients (~77%) had either too low weight or too low platelet counts (and in accordance with 
the amended dosing strategy should have been given 200 mg). The proportion in the placebo groups was 
nearly the same (~74% and ~27%, respectively). 
There was a total of 238 patients (156 in the niraparib group and 82 in the placebo group) who received 
either 200 mg or 300 mg in accordance with the algorithm of body weight and platelet count (nominated 
“individualised starting dose”). Of these 238 patients, it was 122/156 in the niraparib group (i.e., 78%) 
vs. 61/82 in the placebo group (i.e., 74%) who specifically received the applied 200 mg starting dose in 
line with the algorithm.

Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
The original protocol (final: 26 October 2015) was amended during the study for clarification and changes 
in analyses. The key revisions based on the protocol amendments are outlined in the table below. 
Table 22. Protocol amendment history for Study PR-30-5017-C 
Changes in the planned analyses 
The following were the changes between the protocol-defined statistical analyses and the final SAP: 
Assessment report  
EMA/531223/2020 
Page 70/168 
 
 
  
  
 
 
• 
The Patient Reported Outcome neuropathy questionnaire evaluation was removed in Protocol 
Amendment 1. 
•  Based on the Protocol Amendment 1 expanded inclusion criteria to include all subjects with Stage 
III or IV ovarian cancer following front-line platinum-based chemotherapy treatment and not limit 
to subjects of homologous recombination deficiency status, the SAP specified analysis populations 
were clarified to include a homologous recombination deficient population consisting of subjects 
from the pre-specified ITT population who had a tumor homologous recombination deficiency test 
status of positive by the clinical trial assay. Full disposition, efficacy, and safety analyses were 
performed. 
• 
Full efficacy and safety analyses by starting dose subgroups. 
The following were the changes between analyses defined in the SAP and those presented in this report: 
• 
• 
• 
The protocol and SAP defined exploratory objective to explore the relationship between 
homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) status and platinum sensitivity in ovarian cancer 
patients who have initial response to front-line platinum therapy were not analysed because 
platinum sensitivity status cannot be defined for the study population who were enrolled earlier 
than 6 months after the first line platinum-based chemotherapy. 
The study protocol specified secondary endpoint analysis of time to CA-125 progression was not 
performed because the CA-125 progression is part of the clinical evaluation of PFS, the time to 
CA-125 progression alone has limited clinical interpretation; therefore, it was not analysed. 
The study protocol specified exploratory analysis of estimating PK parameters for niraparib’s 
major metabolite, M1, was not completed. The rationale was that M1 had been confirmed to have 
no pharmacological activity against PARP along with completed non-clinical safety evaluations 
that supported its negligible contribution to overall safety and toxicity as compared to parent 
drug. 
Protocol deviations 
A summary of significant and important protocol deviations in the overall population is provided in the 
table below.

Tumour grade was determined based either on histological or cytological data provided by the 
investigator. However, the main amount of data was based on histology. For a total of 26/733 (3.5%) 
patients in the Overall population (ITT) and for a total of 16/373 (4.3%) patients in the HRDpos 
population (ITT), the histological data were not assessable. The percentage of patients with no assessable 
data were quite similar between the niraparib arm and the placebo arm for both the HRDpos (4.0% vs. 
4.8%, respectively) and the Overall population (3.3% vs. 4.1%, respectively). Of the patients with 
assessable histological data, all patients were high-grade in the HRDpos population (ITT), while in the 
Overall population, there were 2 low-grade patients in the niraparib-arm. These 2 patients belonged to 
the fixed starting dose group. The MAH sought additional tissue biopsies from the 2 subjects, however, no 
further data became available.

Table 34. Kaplan-Meier estimates of PFS follow-up time in HRDpos and overall, by fixed and 
individualised starting dose subgroup (ITT population)
Reasons for censoring, including number of patients, for both the HRDpos and the Overall population 
were provided. This included also the fixed and individualised starting dose groups, in addition to the 
dosing subgroups C - Fixed Starting Dose subgroup (300 mg starting dose) with BW <77kg or PC 
<150K/μL and D - Individualised Starting Dose subgroup (200 mg starting dose) with BW <77kg or PC 
<150K/μL.  
The total number of censored patients was, among, the HRDpos patients 166/247 (67.2%) in the 
niraparib arm and 53/126 (42.1%) patients in the placebo group. For the Overall population, the number 
of censored patients was 255/487 (52.4%) in the niraparib arm vs. 91/246 (37.0%) in the placebo arm. 
The most common reason for censoring in both arms in all populations was “last tumour assessment”. 
This comprised patients who had not progressed or died and had not started subsequent anti-cancer 
therapy and who were censored at the date of the latest evaluable radiological assessment. Censoring 
due to this reason was more common in the niraparib arm than in the placebo arm (in the ITT population: 
HRDpos: 132/247, 53.4% vs. 43/126, 34.1% in the placebo arm and in the Overall population: 192/487, 
39.4% in the niraparib arm vs. 72/246, 29.3% in the placebo arm). In the niraparib arm, the proportion 
of patients who were censored due to this reason was a bit higher in the dosing subgroup D (ISD, 200 
mg) compared to the dosing subgroup C (FSD, 300 mg) for both the HRDpos patients (59.1% vs. 48.7%, 
respectively) and the Overall population (41.8% vs. 36.6%, respectively). In the placebo arm, the 
proportions were lower, however, the same trend as for the niraparib-treated patients was observed. For 
the Overall and the HRDpos populations, the reason for the PFS events was progression in all patients 
having an event, apart from one event in the placebo arm in the Overall population which was stated to 
be death.

The number of subjects with a baseline platelet count <150,000/µL (one of the two proposed 
discrimination criteria for the starting dose) was low (9 out of 156 patients, 6%) in the PRIMA study. Of 
the patients who received the 200 mg starting dose, 120 of 122 patients had a body weight below 77 kg. 
Only two subjects with body weight above 77 kg received the 200 mg starting dose due to a low baseline 
platelet count.

The concordance between BICR and investigator-assessed PFS was high in both the Overall and HRDpos 
patient populations in both the niraparib (88.8%, 88.2% respectively) and placebo (86.6%, 84.9% 
respectively) treatment arms. In both the Overall and HRDpos populations, patients were more likely to 
be considered to have an event by investigator than by BICR in both treatment arms. 
Secondary endpoints 
•  Key secondary endpoint: Overall survival 
At the time of primary PFS analysis, the estimated survival at two years after randomization was 84% for 
patients receiving Zejula, as compared to 77% for patients receiving placebo in the overall population.

•  Outcomes for next anticancer therapy following study treatment 
No data have been included in the submitted documentation for this secondary endpoint. 
As follow-up anticancer therapy, the majority of patients in both the niraparib arm and the placebo arm in 
both the HRDpos population and the Overall population received a platinum (most commonly carboplatin 
with around 25-30% in the niraparib arm and 30-33% in the placebo arm), paclitaxel (10-12% of the 
arms in the Overall population; 6-7% of the arms of the HRDpos population), pegylated liposomal 
doxorubicin hydrochloride (12% in the arms of the Overall population and 8-10% in the arms of the 
HRDpos population) and gemcitabine (11-12% in both arms in the Overall population and 8-9% in the 
arms of the HRDpos population). 
More patients in the Overall population received bevacizumab as follow-up anticancer therapy (8% in the 
niraparib arm vs. nearly 13% in the placebo arm) compared to the HRDpos patients (ca. 5% in the 
niraparib group vs. ca. 7% in the placebo group).  
Few patients in both arms in both populations received PARP-inhibitors as follow-up anticancer therapy (a 
total of 1.4% in the niraparib arm vs. 4.5% in the placebo arm in the Overall population vs. 2.8% in the 
niraparib arm vs. 5.6% in the placebo arm in the HRDpos population).

Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs)  
Symptoms of ovarian cancer were assessed in the PRIMA study using the functional assessment of cancer 
therapy–ovarian symptom index (FOSI), and quality of life was assessed using the EQ-5D-5L health utility 
index (HUI) and the visual analog scale (VAS). In addition, the EORTC-QLQ-C30 and the EORTC-QLQ-
OV28 were used to measure symptoms, function, and health-related QoL. The latter was designed 
specifically for ovarian cancer patients. 
PROs were collected every 8 weeks (± 7 days) for 56 weeks beginning on C1D1, then every 12 weeks (± 
7 days) thereafter while the patient was receiving study treatment. 
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy–Ovarian Symptom Index (FOSI) 
Baseline symptoms and quality of life were equivalent between placebo and niraparib patients in the 
overall population (overall FOSI niraparib mean=25.6 [SD=3.73] versus placebo mean=25.4 [SD=3.51]). 
Similar results were observed throughout the study with no observed differences in changes from 
baseline during the treatment period (p>0.05 for each assessment and each treatment arm on each 
patient outcome with one exception: Cycle 3 of the FOSI [p=0.0447] where placebo had a higher value. 
Baseline symptoms and quality of life were also equivalent between placebo and niraparib in patients with 
HRDpos tumors (FOSI niraparib mean=25.6 [SD=3.64] versus placebo mean=25.3 [SD=3.54]).

and each treatment arm on each patient outcome with 1 exception: Cycle 5 of the HUI [p=0.0234] where 
niraparib had the higher value). 
Baseline EQ-5D-5L scoring was also similar between placebo and niraparib patients with homologous 
recombination-deficient tumours (HUI niraparib mean=0.832 [SD=0.1207] versus placebo mean=0.818 
[SD=0.1303]; VAS niraparib mean=76.5 [SD=17.29] versus placebo mean=75.9 [SD=16.74]).

Baseline global health status/quality of life were equivalent between placebo and niraparib patients in the 
overall population (overall EORTC-QLQ-C30 niraparib mean=71.5 [SD=18.86] versus placebo mean=70.2 
[SD=18.66]). Similar results were observed throughout the study in the Overall population with no 
consistent observed differences during the treatment period on most assessment (p>0.05 for each 
assessment at each visit). Exceptions were observed in gastrointestinal related assessments. 
Constipation, nausea/vomiting and appetite loss were reported as significantly worse in niraparib treated 
patients. Diarrhea was reported as significantly worse in placebo treated patients. Similar results were 
observed throughout the study in the homologous recombination deficient population with no consistent 
observed differences during the treatment period for most assessments.

Subgroup analyses by starting dose and baseline body weight and baseline platelet counts 
Additional post-hoc analyses were presented to characterise the efficacy for each starting dose subgroup 
by baseline body weight and baseline platelet counts for each of the three populations; Overall 
population, HRDpos population and HRDneg population, as outlined below: 
A.  Fixed Starting Dose subgroup (300 mg starting dose) with body weight (BW) ≥ 77kg and platelet 
count (PC) ≥ 150K/µL

B.  Individualised Starting Dose subgroup (300 mg starting dose) with BW ≥ 77kg and PC ≥150K/μL 
C.  Fixed Starting Dose subgroup (300 mg starting dose) with BW <77kg or PC <150K/μL 
D.  Individualised Starting Dose subgroup (200 mg starting dose) with BW <77kg or PC <150K/μL 
E.  Individualised Starting Dose subgroup (300 mg starting dose) for all patients (regardless of their 
baseline body weight and platelet counts) 
F.  Individualised Starting Dose subgroup (200 mg starting dose) for all patients (regardless of their 
baseline body weight and platelet counts) 
A proportion of 76% (N=542/711) of the patients had body weight <77kg or platelet counts <150K/µL 
and 24% (N= 169/711) had body weight ≥77kg or platelet counts ≥150K/µL.  
Summaries of patient disposition, demographics, biomarker status and other baseline disease 
characteristics split by the subgroups A-D generally reflected what was seen in the fixed and 
individualised starting dose groups (this is displayed for subgroups C and D further below, but not shown 
for subgroups A-B and E-F).

Efficacy of the applied 200 mg dose 
In the subgroup C “Fixed Starting Dose subgroup (300 mg starting dose) with BW <77kg or PC 
<150K/μL” patients received 300 mg although they should have received 200 mg to be in accordance 
with the MAH’s body weight/platelet algorithm.

In the subgroup D “Individualised Starting Dose subgroup (200 mg starting dose) with BW <77kg or PC 
<150K/μL” the patients received 200 mg in accordance with the algorithm.  
Considering the applied dose of 200 mg for all patients (except those patients weighing ≥ 77 kg and ≥ 
150K/µL), it is therefore of special interest to compare patient demographics and baseline characteristics 
and efficacy results for the two subgroups C and D.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Zejula (niraparib) is currently approved as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients 
with platinum-sensitive relapsed high-grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary 
peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) to platinum-based chemotherapy. This 
approval was mainly based on data from the Phase 3 NOVA clinical trial. 
The MAH is seeking authorisation to extend the indication of Zejula (niraparib) to include first-line 
treatment: “for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced high-grade ovarian, fallopian 
tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) following completion of first-
line platinum-based chemotherapy.” 
Currently, the general recommended and approved starting dose is 300 mg once daily (to be adjusted in 
case of adverse reactions). However, in connection with the applied extension of the indication, the MAH 
also seeks to change the posology, by recommending a general starting dose of 200 mg once daily. For 
those patients weighing ≥ 77 kg and having baseline platelet count ≥ 150 000/µL though, the 
recommended starting dose is 300 mg once daily (see discussion on clinical pharmacology). During the 
initial MA application review for Zejula, low body weight and low baseline platelet count were identified as 
potential risk factors for treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Consequently, the MAH included a 
statement in the SmPC suggesting that a starting dose of 200 mg for patients weighing less than 58 kg 
may be considered. It was advised that the MAH should further investigate alternative dosing strategies 
to reduce adverse events (AEs) for niraparib while still maintaining clinical efficacy. As a result, the MAH 
submitted a Type II Variation (procedure no. EMEA/H/C/004249/II/0006) where a starting dose of 
200 mg niraparib was recommended for the subset of ovarian cancer patients with body weight <77 kg or 
platelet count <150,000/μL. This alternative dosing strategy was introduced in order to reduce the risk of 
high-grade TEAEs, such as Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, while not compromising the efficacy. The data 
submitted in support of the change in posology was based on exposure-efficacy models. However, as 
serious limitations of these models were found, it was not possible to conclude about the efficacy of the 
proposed posology. The CHMP concluded that without the support of a prospective study, the new dosage 
regimen could not be accepted. The variation EMEA/H/C/004249/II/0006 was withdrawn. 
The current claims of extension of indication and change in posology are mainly based on one pivotal 
Phase 3 study called PRIMA.

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The PRIMA study is a Phase 3, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multicentre, global clinical 
trial.  Primary  objective  was  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  niraparib  as  first-line  maintenance 
treatment  for  patients  with  ovarian,  primary  peritoneal  or  fallopian  tube  cancer  who  were  in  complete 
response  (CR)  or  partial  response  (PR)  to  their  last  platinum-based  chemotherapy.  Subjects  were 
randomised 2:1 to receive either niraparib or placebo and stratified by best response to platinum therapy 
(CR  or  PR),  administration  of  neoadjuvant  chemotherapy  (yes  or  no)  and  homologous  recombination 
deficiency (HRD) status (positive or negative/not determined). Central HRD test results as assessed by a 
clinical  trial  assay  (Myriad  HRD  test)  were  required  for  randomisation  as  it  was  a  stratification  factor. 
Subjects  with  documented  gBRCA1/2  or  sBRCA1/2  mutation  by  local  testing  were  considered  to  have 
HRDpos tumours and have been randomised as such. The MAH was asked to discuss the concordance of 
the local test results with the central test. The MAH clarified that 120 patients had locally reported gBRCA1/2 
or sBRCA 1/2 mutations. For these 120 patients, the central test produced 110 HRDpos, 4 HRDneg and 
6 HRDnd  results.  Of  the  10  HRD  negative  or  HRDnd  results,  8  patients  (3  HRDneg  and  5  HRDnd)  were 
randomized to HRDpos stratum (based on the locally reported BRCA mutations). The primary analysis of 
PFS in the ITT population was performed based on randomized HRD stratum and a sensitivity analysis was 
conducted  based  on  the  strata  derived  from  the  actual  eCRF  data  which  included  the  HRD  stratum 
determined by the myChoice CDx result. Consistent results were observed between both analyses. 
In connection with the review of the MAA for Zejula, it was a concern that the HRD test did not provide 
sufficient sensitivity to select patients for niraparib treatment (see EPAR Zejula). The MAH was therefore 
recommended to further explore validated biomarkers of HR deficiency that could be incorporated in clinical 
practice in order to identify those patients that would benefit from niraparib therapy. In 2019, this test was 
approved by the FDA and used in the QUADRA study that formed the basis for FDA approving Zejula for 
treatment  of  ovarian  cancer  patients  treated  with  ≥  3  chemotherapy  regimens  and  whose  cancer  was 
associated  with  HRDpos  status  (indication  not  approved  in  EU).  However,  this  test  is  not  at  present 
commonly available and used in EU. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the test to select patients for niraparib 
treatment has not been further discussed as part of this application.  
All  subjects  in  the  PRIMA  study  had  to  have  received  frontline  or  neoadjuvant/adjuvant  platinum-based 
therapy  (including  at  least  two  post-operative  cycles  of  platinum-based  therapy  after  interval  debulking 
surgery), with a physician-assessed response of CR or PR after at least three cycles of therapy. Cross-over 
of patients from the placebo-arm was not allowed. All patients, independent of the BRCA or HRD status, 
were randomised within 12 weeks of the first day of the last cycle of chemotherapy, meaning that ‘platinum-
free interval’ could be maximum 3 months. There was no pre-selection of patients with HR-deficiency based 
on platinum sensitivity (defined as PFI>6 months). 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria were generally well defined, reflecting the study population intended 
for maintenance treatment after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Stage III and IV patients were 
eligible, except stage III patients that had complete cytoreduction.  
As the majority of high-grade ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer are of epithelial origin, 
it was requested that “epithelial” was added to the indication. It was also clarified that niraparib is used in 
“monotherapy” and “advanced” refers to FIGO stages III and IV. To make sure that the study population 
indeed were high-grade patients, the MAH was asked to present tumour grade at diagnosis for both arms 
in the HRDpos and Overall population, in addition to the fixed and individualised dosing groups. Based on 
the additional information provided, it was concluded that, overall, the study population consisted of high-
grade patients. It is therefore considered justified that high-grade is reflected in the indication wording. 
Furthermore, Stage III patients who had complete cytoreduction after primary surgery were excluded 
from the pivotal study. As these patients have a clearly different prognosis, the MAH was requested to 
Assessment report  
EMA/531223/2020 
Page 118/168 
 
 
  
  
justify a positive B/R in that population and as such the inclusion in the indication. The MAH explained 
that Stage III patients who had no visual residual disease (NVRD) at the time of primary debulking 
surgery (PDS) were excluded in order to try to minimize the time required to reach the number of events 
triggering outcomes analysis. However, Stage III patients with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and 
who had NVRD post interval debulking surgery (IDS) were allowed into the study. An exploratory PFS 
analysis was performed for these patients. Even though the analysis is exploratory and the subset of 
patients is relatively limited and should therefore be interpreted with caution, the results indicated a 
benefit of niraparib in this subset of patients (HR=0.58 [95%CI: 0.374, 0.902], median PFS of 19.3 
months in the niraparib arm [n=128] vs. 11.0 months in the placebo arm [n=62]). The MAH also referred 
to the beneficial results from the SOLO-1 study for another PARP-inhibitor, olaparib. In this study, Stage 
III patients with PDS and NVRD were included, and the PFS analysis indicated a clear benefit of olaparib 
compared to placebo (HR of 0.32, 95%CI 0.20, 051). It is acknowledged that olaparib and niraparib have 
similar mechanism of action, and it is therefore not considered unreasonable to anticipate that niraparib 
and olaparib would, to some degree, have similar effect in the same patient population. Taken together, it 
can be accepted that the data presented by the MAH indicate a positive B/R of niraparib for the whole 
Stage III population. However, it is still considered relevant to inform the physicians that this type of 
Stage III patients has actually not been treated in the PRIMA study. It is therefore stated in section 5.1 of 
the SmPC that these Stage III patients were excluded. 
Amendment 1 (01 December 2016 after 44 subjects were enrolled) included several changes to the 
original protocol; some were modifications to the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The most extensive change 
was to include patients independent of HRD status as in the original protocol patient enrolment was 
limited to those with HR deficient status. The rationale for changing this was based on results from the 
NOVA trial where clinical benefit from niraparib therapy was consistently demonstrated in a broad 
population of ovarian cancer patients regardless of HRD status. Germline BRCA testing was not required 
and it is therefore unknown if tumour BRCA mutations were somatic or germline. It appears that the 
myChoice HRD test identifies germline and somatic variants in the tumour but does not distinguish 
between the two. However, this information is not strictly required for the study population and data 
analyses. 
There is a priori biological rationale and evidence indicating that HR-deficiency biomarker can be a 
plausibly predictive factor of therapeutic response for niraparib in ovarian cancer, more particularly when 
patient’s platinum sensitivity could not be established.   
The inclusion of only HRDpos patients early in the study may have resulted in a slightly overestimated 
outcome in the Overall population as HRDpos patients are expected to respond favourably to PARP-
inhibitors. Since the changes were implemented early in the PRIMA trial, they are considered acceptable. 
At the time of study initiation (01 December 2016), all patients received 300 mg as the starting dose. 
However, on 16 November 2017 (Amendment 2) the dosing scheme was revised. A dosing of either 
200 mg or 300 mg based on an algorithm comprising the patient’s weight and/or platelet counts was 
implemented. This entailed that patients weighing ≥ 77 kg and having baseline platelet count ≥ 
150 000/µl should receive 300 mg daily, while patients < 77 kg or baseline platelet count < 150 000/µl 
should receive 200 mg. However, at the time point this change was introduced, a total of 473 patients 
had already received the fixed starting dose of 300 mg (whereof 315 in the niraparib group). The 
hypothesis regarding dosing strategy was changed during enrolment and conduct of the study without 
increasing sample size to ensure sufficient power for the individualised dosing group. This clearly affects 
the interpretation of the efficacy data for the lower dose. 
A substantial higher number of patients with at least one important protocol deviation was reported in the 
niraparib arm as compared to the placebo arm. The MAH was therefore asked to discuss details and 
possible reasons for this discrepancy and if it could somehow have impacted study integrity, in particular

in relation to the efficacy analyses and timing of the radiographic assessments. The main difference 
between the two study arms was in the category “study visits/procedures” with a reported difference of 
13.7% (26.3% in the niraparib arm vs. 12.6% in the placebo arm). According to the MAH, the reason for 
this discrepancy was mainly due to missed weekly complete blood count (CBC) blood drawing after 
haematological toxicity resolution in the niraparib group. This deviation was not observed in the placebo 
group. Concerning protocol deviations (PDs) that could possibly affect the timing of the radiographic 
assessments, the MAH stated that there were proportionally similar percentages of deviations between 
the niraparib arm and the placebo arm in regard to RECIST assessment not done per protocol 
requirements. No detailed information was provided. However, a sensitivity analysis using the mid-point 
between progression time and previous assessment for unscheduled assessments has been performed 
and showed no impact on the primary efficacy analysis. 
Placebo was used as comparator and this was found acceptable by the SAWP/CHMP. The only currently 
approved maintenance regimen for the first-line ovarian population, not limited to patients positive for 
BRCA mutations and/or HRD, is bevacizumab. At the time of study initiation (2016) bevacizumab 
treatment in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel followed by bevacizumab maintenance was used 
to various extent in the EU and was not approved in all regions where the PRIMA study was performed 
(e.g., approved in 2018 in the US). Bevacizumab was therefore not considered suitable as comparator by 
the MAH. This reasoning can be accepted. Nevertheless, it could have been possible to consider 
bevacizumab as a treatment option under discretion of investigator and according to local practice. This 
could have given further insights into the extent of the efficacy of the treatment with niraparib when 
compared to bevacizumab. Olaparib, another PARP inhibitor, is also approved for first-line maintenance 
treatment in patients with ovarian cancer (however, not until June 2019), but only in patients with a 
mutation in the BRCA gene. Olaparib was therefore not viewed as a suitable comparator in this study. 
Overall, it is considered acceptable that placebo was used as comparator. 
Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) and the analyses of PFS were based on the HRDpos 
population  and  the  ITT  population  (“Overall  population”).  CHMP/SAWP  concluded  that  PFS  was  an 
acceptable  primary  endpoint  provided  that  the  treatment  effect  was  large  and  clearly  outweighed  the 
toxicity of maintenance therapy. Furthermore, it is not influenced by the impact of post progression therapy. 
Overall  survival  (OS)  was  a  key  secondary  endpoint.  Other  secondary  endpoints  were  patient-reported 
outcomes  (PROs),  time  to  first  subsequent  treatment  (TFST),  outcomes  for  the  next  anticancer  therapy 
following study treatment and PFS-2. Crossover to niraparib was not permitted within the study design. 
However, patients could not be prevented from being switched to niraparib or a PARP inhibitor outside of 
the study. OS and PFS 2 analysis will thus be diluted by cross-over and multiple subsequent lines of therapy.  
A blinded independent review committee (BIRC) was used to assess study imaging based on RECIST 
(version 1.1) and available clinical data for the primary analysis.  
The sample size calculations were based on PFS in the HRDpos group and an event-based analysis. The 
sample size was adjusted when amending the protocol to change inclusion criteria. However, it was not 
changed when adjusting the dosing scheme to give a fully powered analysis only including patients 
included after the change. 
The primary PFS analysis is not in accordance with EMA guidelines (CHMP/EWP/205/95 REV. 3): 
“outcome data should be collected according to the intended schedule of assessment and the date of 
progression or recurrence should be assigned based on the time of the first evidence of objective 
progression or recurrence regardless of violations, discontinuation of study drug or change of therapy”. 
However, the required analyses not censoring events after change in therapy or missed assessments 
were included among the performed sensitivity analyses.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The data cut-off date for the primary data analysis in the PRIMA study was 17 May 2019 with a database 
lock date of 3 July 2019. A total of 733 patients (487 subjects/niraparib and 246 subjects/placebo) were 
randomised into the study, however 256 patients were recorded as screen failures. The MAH clarified that 
the main part of patients who were screen failures did not meet the clinical or laboratory inclusion 
criteria. Of the 234 patients for whom data were available, the majority of patients (62/234; 26%) failed 
due to lack of “having either CA-125 in the normal range or CA-125 decreased by more than 90% during 
their frontline therapy that was stable for more than 7 days”. In total, 728 patients received intervention 
(484 patients in the niraparib arm vs. 244 patients in the placebo arm). Of these 728 patients, 370 
(~50%) were categorised as HRDpos (245 in the niraparib arm vs. 125 in the placebo arm). The main 
reason for discontinuing the study was disease progression.  
As previously mentioned, 473 subjects (315 niraparib, 158 placebo) had received the 300 mg starting 
dose (nominated “Fixed starting dose” or FSD) prior to the change of dosing strategy (Amendment 2 of 
the protocol). After the amendment, 238 patients (156 in the niraparib group and 82 in the placebo 
group) received either 200 mg or 300 mg in accordance with the algorithm of body weight and platelet 
count (nominated “Individualised starting dose group” or ISD). Of the 156 niraparib patients, it was 122 
(i.e., 78%) patients vs. 61/82 (i.e., 74%) patients in the placebo group that specifically received the 
applied 200 mg starting dose in accordance with the algorithm of body weight/platelet count. The 
proportions of patients discontinuing the study and specifically discontinuing due to disease progression 
for both the fixed and individualised starting dose group were mainly comparable to that reported in the 
Overall population and HRDpos population.  
In the ITT population, baseline patient demographic and disease/tumour characteristics as well as all 
stratification factors were, in general well balanced between the two treatment arms, both in the HRDpos 
and the Overall population. History of debulking surgery (timing and outcome) was also compared across 
treatment arms in both cohorts and no significant difference was revealed. 
The number of prior lines of chemotherapy, and CR/PR to primary platinum-based chemotherapy were 
also balanced between the niraparib and placebo treatment arms in both populations. 
Discrepancies for stratification factors between the randomisation list and screening eCRF occurred (data 
not shown). However, they were well balanced across both arms in the Overall population. Overall, 
discrepancies were seen in 8.6% of subjects for the best response to first platinum regimen (CR or PR), 
and 4.1% of the subjects for neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (yes or no) and 1.2% of subjects for HRD test 
status (pos or neg). 
The disease characteristics of the patients were consistent with an advanced ovarian cancer population 
and in line with the proposed indication wording. The study population was stratified for HRD status and 
as such, this factor was well balanced between the treatment arms. Fifty (~50) percent of the subjects 
were HRDpos, of these, 30% had mutation in the BRCA gene. BRCAmut subtypes included BRCA1 (21.6% 
niraparib subjects and 17.5% placebo subjects, respectively) and BRCA2 mutations (9.7% niraparib 
subjects and 11.4% placebo subjects, respectively). The remaining patients were HRDneg (~35%) and 
~15% had HRD status not determined. The latter was applied if test results were inconclusive (e.g. due 
to insufficient tumour specimen) or the test was not done.  
Generally, in both the HRDpos and Overall population there were no noteworthy differences in baseline 
characteristics between patients who received a fixed starting dose (300 mg) compared with those who 
received an individualised starting dose (200 mg or 300 mg) in either treatment arm. The only exception 
that might have consequences for the interpretation of the data was that fewer patients (both in the 
niraparib and the placebo group) in the individualised starting dose group had a complete response to 
first-line platinum based chemotherapy (~62%) compared to in the fixed starting dose group (~74%) in 
Assessment report

the Overall population. However, it should be noted that the patients were not randomised when they 
were assigned to the different starting dose groups as this was based on cut-off values for weight and/or 
baseline platelet counts. 
According to the protocol, patients who had received bevacizumab with their 1L chemotherapy but were 
unable to receive bevacizumab as maintenance for any reason could have been included in the study as 
long as the last dose of bevacizumab was received 28 >days prior ICF. The MAH was asked to summarise 
and discuss data (efficacy and safety) in the patients treated with bevacizumab. The data showed 
consistency with the overall population data (data not shown). However, the prior use of bevacizumab as 
part of the adjuvant/neo-adjuvant platinum regimen prior to enrolment in the PRIMA study concerned 
only 6 patients in the niraparib arm. This information has been added to section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
The PRIMA study met its primary efficacy objective.  
In HRD positive subjects, treatment with niraparib prolonged median PFS by 11.5 months compared to 
placebo, independent of starting dose. Median PFS as determined by BICR based on RECIST (version 
1.1), was 21.9 months (95% CI: 19.3, NE) in the niraparib arm and 10.4 (95% CI: 8.1, 12.1) months in 
the placebo arm (HR 0.43 [95% CI: 0.310, 0.588]; p<0.0001).  
In the Overall population, treatment with niraparib prolonged median PFS by 5.6 months compared to 
placebo. Median PFS as determined by BICR based on RECIST (version 1.1) was 13.8 (95% CI: 11.5, 
14.9) months in the niraparib arm and 8.2 (95% CI: 7.3, 8.5) months in the placebo arm (HR 0.62 [95% 
CI: 0.502, 0.755]; p<0.0001). The outcomes in both populations are considered clinically relevant in a 
disease with unmet medical need.  
Per request, the MAH provided reasons for censoring in the different populations. Among the HRDpos 
patients, the total number of censored patients was 166/247 (67.2%) in the niraparib arm and 53/126 
(42.1%) patients in the placebo group. For the overall population, the number was 255/487 (52.4%) in 
the niraparib arm vs. 91/246 (37.0%) in the placebo arm. The most common reason for censoring in both 
arms in all populations was “last tumour assessment”. This comprised patients who had not progressed or 
died and had not started subsequent anti-cancer therapy and who were censored at the date of the latest 
evaluable radiological assessment. Censoring due to this reason was more common in the niraparib arm 
than in the placebo arm (in the ITT population: HRDpos: 132/247, 53.4% vs. 43/126, 34.1% in the 
placebo arm and in the Overall population: 192/487, 39.4% in the niraparib arm vs. 72/246, 29.3% in 
the placebo arm). This difference could be viewed as a reflection of the observed increased treatment 
effect of niraparib as compared to placebo.  
Both investigator assessed PFS and sensitivity analyses were consistent with the primary efficacy results.  
The concordance between BICR and investigator-assessed PFS was high in both the overall and HRDpos 
patient populations in both the niraparib (88.8%, 88.2% respectively) and placebo (86.6%, 84.9% 
respectively) treatment arms. In both the overall and HRDpos populations, patients were more likely to 
be considered to have an event by investigator than by BICR in both treatment arms. 
Compared to the results in the primary analyses, similar median PFS outcomes were seen in both the 
HRDpos and overall population in the fixed starting dose group - FSD (encompassed 65% of the total ITT 
population).  
For the individualised starting dose group - ISD (i.e., comprises both those patients receiving 200 mg and 
those patients receiving 300 mg starting dose in accordance with the algorithm), the median prolongation 
in PFS appears to be shorter as compared to the fixed starting dose group for niraparib treatment, even 
though quite similar hazard ratios were presented for both the HRDpos and the Overall population. The 
individualised starting dose group had a shorter follow-up time as of data cut-off (median PFS follow up 
time 11.1 months in the individualised starting dose group as compared to 16.6 months in the fixed 
Assessment report

starting dose group). The number of patients censored was relatively high, as they had not yet had an 
event, thus it was not possible to interpret these data. Updated efficacy analyses were provided by the 
MAH, see further below under “Subgroups” for more details.  
The MAH argued that since the test of interaction between the starting dose groups (fixed vs. 
individualised) showed non-significant p-values (0.7486 in the HRDpos population and 0.2957 in the 
Overall population), the change in dose had no significant effect on PFS for these populations. However, it 
has to be emphasized that a high p-value in this context cannot be used to conclude on similarity 
between the two starting dose groups. The PRIMA study was neither designed nor powered to draw any 
conclusions on the treatment effect of the different starting doses. 
Secondary endpoints  
All the secondary endpoints (i.e., OS, TFST, PFS-2 and outcomes for next anticancer therapy) were 
immature at the data cut-off date. Hence, these data were not informative enough to exclude a potential 
detrimental effect in the ITT population or in the subgroups. As resistance mechanisms might occur in 
ovarian cancer patients after exposure to PARP-inhibitors, this could possibly affect the efficacy of next 
line therapy. Therefore, the immaturity of these data makes the long-term outcomes uncertain. As the 
initial efficacy assessment is based on PFS, it requires further investigation and a new condition is 
imposed for the MAH to submit updated analyses for all of the secondary endpoints when 60% maturity 
has occurred for OS (submission by 31 December 2025, Annex II condition).  
The PRO analyses are considered exploratory and no statistical inference can be made. Overall, what can 
be inferred from these data are that gastrointestinal symptoms such as constipation, nausea/vomiting 
and appetite loss were reported of a higher proportion of patients in the niraparib arm as compared to 
patients in the placebo arm (please refer to Clinical Safety below).  
Subgroups 
Main subgroup analyses (data cut-off date 17 May 2019) 
In general, a PFS benefit of niraparib with HR<1 was observed in the majority of subgroups indicating 
efficacy independent of baseline and disease characteristics. 
As anticipated, based on knowledge of efficacy outcomes in the NOVA study, the tBRCAmut subgroup in 
the Overall population had the most promising outcome with median PFS of 22.1 months [95%CI: 19.3, 
NE] vs. 10.9 months [95%CI: 8.0, 19.4] in the niraparib arm vs. the placebo am, respectively; HR of 
0.40 [95%CI: 0.265, 0.618], p<0.0001).  
In non-tBRCAm/HRDpos patients, HR was 0.5 (95% CI: 0.3; 0.83) p=0.0064. These data highlight that 
the efficacy of niraparib was not driven solely by the patients with BRCAmut tumours. 
A positive effect of niraparib treatment was also observed in the HRDneg subgroup (N=249) with median 
PFS of 8.1 months [95%CI: 5.7, 9.4] vs. 5.4 months [95%CI: 4.0, 7.3] in the niraparib arm vs. the 
placebo am, respectively; HR of 0.68 [95%CI: 0.492, 0.944], p=0.0203). This is indicative of a positive 
effect of niraparib in the Overall population even though the effect was less than for the HRDpos 
population. This is also observed for the HRDneg patients in the Fixed starting dose group and the 
Individualised starting dose group (HR of 0.64 [95% CI: 0.424, 0.969]) and 0.70 [95%CI: 0.402, 1.230], 
respectively).  
Among the biomarker subgroups, the HRD not determined (nd) population (~15%) derived the less 
benefit of niraparib with median PFS of 11.0 months [95%CI: 7.4, 13.9] vs. 8.3 months [95%CI: 5.7, 
12.5] in the niraparib arm vs. the placebo am, respectively; HR of 0.85 [95%CI: 0.509, 1.432], 
p=0.5577). The reason for this is unclear, and the MAH discussed that it could be due to an (unknown) 
imbalanced composition of the homologous recombination (HR) status in each treatment group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/531223/2020 
Page 123/168 
 
 
  
  
Furthermore, the MAH argued that since the composition of HR-status is unknown in these tumours, this 
hazard ratio cannot be attributed to any of the biomarker subgroups and does not have a meaningful 
interpretation. It is acknowledged that further understanding of the poor response and molecular basis of 
this subgroup is difficult with the current data and knowledge. Data concerning the baseline patient and 
disease characteristics for the HRDnd patients showed that there was a higher proportion of patients who 
received NACT in the HRDnd subgroup than others – 88-93% vs. 59-65%, respectively.  Furthermore, 
stratified and un-stratified covariate-adjusted analyses were performed and the results of both analyses 
reduced the hazard ratio estimate from 0.85 to 0.68-0.70.  
Additional post-hoc efficacy analyses of starting dose subgroups (data cut-off date 17 May 2019) 
Additional post-hoc analyses were submitted by the MAH to characterise the efficacy for each starting 
dose subgroup by baseline body weight and baseline platelet counts.  
It was of particular interest, to compare efficacy results for the two subgroups nominated C (=patients 
with BW <77kg or PC <150K/μL taking 300 mg as fixed starting dose) and D (=patients also with BW 
<77kg or PC <150K/μL but taking 200 mg as an individualised starting dose). Of note, there were 
relatively few patients in subgroup D (122 patients in the niraparib arm vs. 61 in the placebo arm).  
When comparing subgroup C vs. subgroup D, it was observed that the HRs were quite similar for the two 
dosing regimens for both the HRDpos and the Overall population. For the HRDneg population, however, 
the HR was clearly lower in subgroup D compared to HR in subgroup C, i.e., 0.61 vs. 0.75, respectively. 
When looking at the differences in median PFS between the niraparib group and the placebo group in the 
two subgroups C and D, it appeared that the gain in median PFS was consistently smaller for subgroup D 
compared to subgroup C for all patient populations and with the largest difference between the two 
dosing groups in the HRDneg population. For the 200 mg starting dose group, fewer patients had reached 
sufficient follow-up time and thus updated analyses were requested. 
Updated efficacy analyses (data cut-off date 17 November 2019) 
Updated 6-month efficacy results were provided for all 3 patient populations (i.e. Overall, HRDpos and 
HRDneg), in the FSD dosing group, the ISD dosing group and the two dosing subgroups C and D. This led 
to an increase in the median follow-up time from 11.2 to 17.0 months (ISD) and from 17.1 to 22.4 
months (FSD). The data maturity rate increased to > 60% in both the FSD and ISD subgroups. The 
updated analyses showed that it was mainly the body weight criterion that determined which patients 
who were to receive 200 and 300 mg in the PRIMA study, while the platelet count criterion only had 
influence on the dose in 2% of the patients.  In contrast to the analyses based on the original data cut-off 
date (i.e., 17 May 2019), the 6-month update (data cut-off date 17 November 2019) is based on 
investigator assessed (IA) PFS. According to the MAH, it was not possible to provide updated data based 
on BICR.  
Consistency between BICR and investigator-assessed PFS (used in the updated efficacy analyses) 
Based on analyses performed by the MAH, consistency was found between BICR and IA PFS for all 3 
patient populations (i.e., Overall, HRDpos and HRDneg) for the dosing group FSD at the original data cut 
off. For the dosing group ISD, consistency was, overall, also quite high between BICR and IA PFS for the 
Overall and HRDpos populations. For the HRDneg population, on the other hand, the results between the 
BICR and IA PFS for the dosing group ISD was less consistent due to a lower (and thereby seemingly 
more beneficial) point estimate of HR when based on IA PFS compared to when based on BICR PFS (HR 
0.59 vs. HR 0.70, respectively). This inconsistency was even more marked for dosing subgroup D (HR by 
BICR was 0.75 vs. 0.46 by IA and for the updated analyses HR was estimated to 0.43 by IA). The reason 
for this diversion in HR point estimates by BICR and IA for the HRDneg population has not been 
specifically discussed by the MAH. However, it is realised that the HRDneg population in subgroup D is of 
Assessment report  
EMA/531223/2020 
Page 124/168 
 
 
  
  
limited size (40 patients in the niraparib arm vs. 17 in the placebo arm). In such a small data set, one or 
two outliers could impact heavily on the results. There is also no biological rationale to expect that lower 
doses of niraparib should lead to higher efficacy in HRDneg patients or that the efficacy should be more 
beneficial in HRDneg compared to HRDpos patients. Consequently, it is doubted that the point estimate 
for HR in this population represents the true treatment effect of the 200 mg dose. 
Updated efficacy analyses for the FSD and ISD groups  
Of note, due to the proposed dosing algorithm, the ISD dosing group consisted not only of patients 
receiving 200 mg, but also some patients receiving 300 mg (this was dependent upon the patient’s 
baseline body weight and platelet count). 
The updated point estimates for HR were relatively similar between the FSD and the ISD for the Overall 
population (0.62 vs. 0.68, respectively) and only slightly lower for FSD compared to ISD for the HRDpos 
population (0.46 vs. 0.54, respectively). Based on these HR point estimates, it appears that the loss in 
treatment effect for the ISD group compared to the FSD group could be considered to be relatively 
modest. When comparing differences in point estimates in medians between niraparib and placebo, the 
median prolongation in PFS always favoured the niraparib arm, although the difference between niraparib 
and placebo was longer in the FSD group compared to what was observed in the ISD group for both 
patient populations (5.7 months vs. 4.3 months, respectively for the Overall population and 14 months 
vs. 6.5 months, respectively for the HRDpos population). The updated KM plots, showed that the effect 
for the FSD and the ISD dosing groups seems quite similar for the Overall and HRDpos population in the 
niraparib arm.  
For the HRDneg population, the updated point estimates for HR in the ISD group was 0.56 vs. 0.64 in the 
FSD group. However, considering the inconsistency between the BICR and IA assessed PFS for the 
original data cut, this HR estimate is, as already mentioned above, questioned. The median prolongation 
in PFS for the HRDneg population was stated to be 1.1 months in the ISD group vs. 5.4 months in the 
FSD group. Moreover, for the HRDneg population, the KM curve for the niraparib arm in the ISD dosing 
group seems to be inferior to the niraparib arm in the FSD dosing group. However, at 8-10 months, there 
are very few patients left, making the result less reliable.  
Updated efficacy analyses for the dosing subgroups C and D   
The point estimates for HR were quite similar between subgroup C and subgroup D for the Overall and 
HRDpos patient populations (both for original and updated data). Based on these HR point estimates, it 
therefore appeared, as a potential loss in treatment effect for the 200 mg dosing group compared to the 
300 mg dosing group could be considered negligible. Although always in favour of the niraparib arm, the 
gain in median PFS (as compared to the placebo arm) wasconsistently lower in subgroup D compared to 
the corresponding populations in subgroup C.  
In the HRDneg population, there was no clinical relevant difference in median PFS between the niraparib 
arm and the placebo arm in subgroup D (5.5 months vs. 5.4 months, respectively). As already stated 
above, the low point estimates of HR for the HRDneg patients in subgroup D are considered to be 
unreliable and not supported by the KM plot. 
The updated KM plots showed a smaller treatment effect for the 200 mg dose (subgroup D) compared to 
the 300 mg dose (subgroup C) for all 3 patient populations. For the Overall and HRDpos populations, the 
curves in subgroup D started to diverge first at around 7-8 months. In contrast, for the 300 mg 
subgroup, the curves were separating early in the study. No explanation has been offered for this 
observation. The HRs for subgroup D might be underestimated. Even if a reduced treatment effect for the 
200 mg dose is seen for all 3 patient population, the greatest loss in efficacy is observed for the HRDneg 
patient population.

Overall conclusion  
Taken together, it seems reasonable to conclude that, based on the available data and current 
knowledge, it cannot be affirmably stated that there is no loss of efficacy with the 200 mg starting dose. 
Compared to the 300 mg starting dose, the efficacy seems to not be fully maintained at the 200 mg 
starting dose for the Overall and HRDpos population. However, the potential loss of efficacy appears to be 
rather modest. For the HRDneg population the 200 mg dose seems to be of lower efficacy compared to 
300 mg. The available data are not sufficiently robust to allow any definite conclusion on efficacy of the 
200 mg dose for this patient group in comparison to the 300 mg dose.  
The PRIMA study was not initially designed with the intent of studying different starting doses and 
considering that the lower dose has only been tested in limited number of subjects, it is realised that the 
study does not have the statistical power to allow any firm conclusions to be drawn in regards to the 200 
mg starting dose compared to the 300 mg starting dose. Consequently, the results of these analyses are 
flawed by uncertainty. Furthermore, for subgroups not based on stratification factors, the results also 
may be confounded by imbalance in the baseline characteristics.  
However, overall, it could be inferred by the data that the modified dosage regimen, when compared to 
placebo, niraparib still showed a PFS benefit.   
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In general, the outcomes of the primary analyses in the overall population are encouraging in a patient 
group, which currently has limited treatment options. However, the documentation for the proposed 
dosing scheme of 200 mg as a starting dose for nearly all patients (with the exception of those weighing 
≥ 77kg and having platelet count ≥ 150K/µL) is not sufficiently robust to conclude with certainty on 
whether the lower dose will reduce efficacy of niraparib compared to 300 mg starting dose.  Nevertheless, 
the potential loss of efficacy appears to be rather modest and the benefit observed remains clinically 
relevant.  
The current data seem to indicate that, compared to the 300 mg dose, the 200 mg dose could lead to 
lower efficacy of niraparib, in the HRDneg patients. As HRDneg patients do not harbour a deficiency in the 
HR machinery, they are probably not as sensitive to PARP inhibitors as HRDpos patients. Thus, a different 
dose-response relationship is expected in these patients and, independent of dose, the treatment effect in 
the HRDneg patients is lower than in HRDpos patients. Information regarding the seeming lower efficacy 
of the 200 mg for HRDneg patients has been stated in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
Overall, the risk of a reduced treatment effect by using a 200 mg starting dose group vs. using a 300 mg 
starting dose has to be weighed against the benefit of a reduced risk of experiencing severe  
thrombocytopenia grade 3 or 4 (and thereby avoiding possible hospitalization, transfusions, interventions, 
and early discontinuation of niraparib) with the 200 mg dose (see discussion on benefit/risk balance).  
Furthermore, relative to placebo, the totality of evidence based on efficacy data with the modified dosage 
regimen is considered to support a clinically relevant improvement in outcome. 
All the secondary endpoints (i.e., OS, TFST, PFS-2 and outcomes for next anticancer therapy) were 
immature at the data cut-off date. Therefore, the following measure is considered necessary to address 
issues related to clinical efficacy:

platinum-based chemotherapy, the MAH should submit the final analysis for OS and 
updated analyses for TFST, PFS-2 and outcomes for next anticancer therapy from 
study PRIMA. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Zejula is currently indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with 
platinum-sensitive relapsed high grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal 
cancer who are in response (complete or partial) to platinum-based chemotherapy (posology 300 mg 
capsule QD). The main safety data in support of this indication was derived from the NOVA trial. The 
NOVA study included 553 patients (546 treated) who had recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer 
with a CR or PR to their last platinum-based chemotherapy treatment and randomized patients 2:1 to 
niraparib or placebo. 
The major factors limiting the tolerability of niraparib are haematological toxicity (most notably 
thrombocytopenia, anaemia and neutropenia), and gastrointestinal events such as nausea/vomiting, in 
addition to fatigue, which lead to frequent dose modifications (>70% of patients). Warnings in SmPC 
section 4.4 are in place for the following ADRs: haematological toxicity, myelodysplastic syndrome/acute 
myeloid leukaemia, hypertension including hypertensive crisis. 
The applicant is seeking to extend the current indication to first-line patients. The recommended starting 
dose for the first-line indication is proposed to be 200 mg QD, except for patients who weigh ≥ 77 kg and 
have baseline platelet count ≥ 150,000/mcL, where the recommended starting dose is 300 mg QD. 
The purpose of this safety evaluation is to assess the safety and tolerability of niraparib in the sought 
indication, and at the proposed dosing regimen, which is different from the dosing regimen in the 
approved indication.  
The primary data to support the safety of treatment with niraparib in the proposed indication are derived 
from the PRIMA study (PR-30-5017-C), where 733 patients were randomised 2:1 to receive niraparib 
(484 patients) or placebo (244 patients). Initially, patients were enrolled at a fixed starting dose (FSD) of 
300 mg QD niraparib or placebo. The dosing strategy was subsequently changed by a trial amendment, to 
an individualised starting dose (ISD), where patients received niraparib 200 mg QD or placebo, except for 
patients who weighed ≥ 77 kg and had baseline platelet count ≥ 150,000/mcL, where the starting dose 
was 300 mg QD or placebo. In the PRIMA trial, 315 patients were treated with the FSD of niraparib 
(300 mg QD), and 169 patients were treated with the ISD of niraparib (200/300 mg QD).  
Because two different starting dose regimens were used in the PRIMA trial (fixed; FSD and individualised; 
ISD), the safety populations have been presented in different ways as described in Table 51. In addition 
to the primary data from the PRIMA trial, supporting safety data from the NOVA trial is presented in the 
safety tabulations, along with pooled data from the PRIMA trial and NOVA trial. Note that the PRIMA and 
NOVA study pool does not contain safety data from the ISD subgroup; only data from the FSD pools 
(300 mg QD) are included in this pool.

Some data are also presented per dosing subgroups in the PRIMA trial. This refers to subdivisions of the 
FSD and ISD safety data according to the baseline weight and platelet count of the patients, as follows: 
Subgroup A: patients with a baseline body weight ≥77 kg and a baseline platelet count of ≥ 150,000/μL 
who received FSD 300 mg; Subgroup B: patients with a baseline body weight ≥77 kg and a baseline 
platelet count of ≥150,000/μL who received ISD 300 mg; Subgroup C: patients with a baseline body 
weight <77 kg or a baseline platelet count of <150,000/μL who received FSD 300 mg; Subgroup D: 
patients with a baseline body weight <77 kg or a baseline platelet count of <150,000/μL who received 
ISD 200 mg. 
Patient exposure 
Safety data in this report are based on a data cut-off date of 17 May 2019, unless indicated. 246 patients 
in the PRIMA study and 39 patients in the NOVA study remain on treatment. Updated safety data from 
the PRIMA trial were subsequently submitted including data up to a cut-off date of 17 November 2019. 
Tables including data from the 17 Nov 2019 cut-off date are indicated with the DCO date.

Table 52. Summary of Overall Exposure to Study Drug (PRIMA and NOVA Study Pool)  
Dose interruptions were required for any patient with a platelet count <100×109/L, neutrophil count 
<1.0×109/L, hemoglobin <8 g/dL, or any non-hematologic NCI CTCAE (version 4.02 for NOVA and 4.03 
for PRIMA) Grade ≥ 3 TEAE that the Investigator considered to be related to the study drug. If Grade 3 or 
4 non-hematologic toxicity was appropriately resolved to baseline or Grade 1 or less within 28 days of 
interruption, the patient was allowed to restart study treatment but with a dose level reduction. The 
minimum niraparib daily dose was 100 mg/day. 
Dose modifications for the patients on niraparib with baseline weight under 77 kg or baseline platelet 
count less than 150 000/µL in the PRIMA study are shown in Table 53.

Table 53. Dose Modifications for the low W/P Population (DCO 17 November 2019) 
Following the implementation of ISD with Amendment 2, 10 patients with baseline weight <77 kg or a 
baseline platelet count of <150,000/μL incorrectly received a 300 mg starting dose. Overall, the rate of 
dosing error based on the ISD dosing algorithm was 13 patients out of 258 (5.0%) who were eligible to 
receive the individualized starting dose and received the incorrect dose. 
For patients whose starting dose was 200 mg QD, escalation to 300 mg QD was permitted if no treatment 
interruption or discontinuation was required during the first 2 cycles of therapy. Thirteen patients, 7 of 
whom who received niraparib and 6 who received placebo, had their dose escalated to 300 mg during 
Cycle 3 or 4. At the time of data cut-off, 8 of these patients had discontinued study treatment 
(5 niraparib and 3 placebo patients). Of the 7 patients who dose escalated niraparib, 3 experienced 
adverse events 1-2 months after receiving the 300 mg dose. This included 1 patient with grade 2 
arthralgia and 1 with grade 3 anaemia which led to dose interruption and reduction. The 3rd patient 
experienced grade 3 thrombocytopenia but discontinued study treatment due to disease progression. 
Demographics/baseline characteristics 
An overview of the baseline characteristics of the patients included in the PRIMA study is presented in the 
clinical efficacy part of this AR (refer to baseline data section of 2.4.2).  
Per protocol, all patients in the PRIMA study had received 1 prior line of platinum-based therapy, with 
most having undergone 6 cycles of 1L platinum-therapy (≥6 and ≤9 cycles specified in Protocol 
Amendment 1, at least 4 cycles were required per original protocol). A total of 97% patients had received 
taxane as part of their prior therapy, 96% received carboplatin, and 8% received cisplatin. Seven patients 
received bevacizumab with chemotherapy during 1L treatment, but bevacizumab was not continued 
during maintenance when they enrolled in the trial.  
History of myelosuppression in the PRIMA and NOVA is shown in Table 54.. Niraparib and placebo 
treatment arms were well balanced with regard to history of myelosuppression, with >87% of patients 
within each treatment arm reporting this event in the PRIMA study (Table 54.). A history of 
thrombocytopenia was noted in >44% of patients across the treatment arms; a history of Grade 3 or 4 
thrombocytopenia was observed in ~5-6% of patients in each treatment arm. The most commonly 
reported history of a Grade 3 or 4 hematologic abnormality was reported for neutropenia, occurring in 
33% to 37% of patients across the treatment arms.

Adverse events  
Standard safety evaluations were conducted in the NOVA and PRIMA studies, including monitoring for 
TEAEs, clinical laboratory evaluations, vital signs, concomitant medication usage, physical examinations, 
and quality-of-life questionnaires. AEs were recorded in PRIMA through 30 days post end of treatment 
(EOT), and in NOVA until EOT (30 days post EOT for SAEs). An ECG sub-study was conducted with data 
from the NOVA study, indicating no clinically meaningful difference in terms of QTc-effect. Hence, ECG 
assessments were only performed at screening in the PRIMA study. Tabulations were classified by Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) System Organ Class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) using 
MedDRA version 20.0. Lab abnormalities were based on National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) grade criteria v4.03. 
PRIMA study 
Most patients in both treatment arms in the PRIMA study experienced at least 1 TEAE, including 
478 (99%) of 484 patients who received niraparib and 224 (92%) of 244 patients who received placebo.  
Patients who received niraparib were more likely to experience treatment-related TEAEs (96% vs 69%), 
CTCAE Grade ≥3 TEAEs (71% vs 19%), treatment-related Grade ≥3 TEAEs (65% vs 7%), SAEs (32% vs 
13%), treatment-related SAEs (24% vs 3%), TEAEs leading to treatment interruption (80% vs 18%), 
TEAEs leading to dose reduction (71% vs 8%), and TEAEs leading to study drug withdrawal (12% vs 3%) 
when compared to patients receiving placebo. 
There were no on-treatment deaths reported in the PRIMA study. Two niraparib patients and 1 placebo 
patient (<1% each) experienced TEAEs leading to death, all were assessed by the Investigator as 
unrelated to study drug. Deaths are further discussed in the section below. 
Serious adverse events and TEAEs of grade 3-4 were decreased in patients receiving the individualized 
starting dose as compared to the fixed starting doses (27% vs 35% and 60% vs 76%, respectively). 
PRIMA and NOVA studies 
When considering the PRIMA and NOVA studies, the incidence of patients experiencing at least 1 TEAE 
was high, with 680 (~100%) of 682 patients in the pooled niraparib group and  396 (94%) of 
Assessment report  
EMA/531223/2020 
Page 131/168 
 
 
  
  
 
 
423 patients in the pooled placebo group reporting at least 1 TEAE. Patients who received niraparib were 
more likely to experience treatment-related TEAEs (98% vs 70%), CTCAE Grade ≥3 TEAEs (76% vs 
21%), treatment-related Grade ≥3 TEAEs (69% vs 6%), SAEs (34% vs 14%), treatment-related SAEs 
(22% vs 2%), TEAEs leading to treatment interruption (76% vs 17%), TEAEs leading to dose reduction 
(72% vs 7%), and TEAEs leading to study drug withdrawal (15% vs 2%) when compared to patients 
receiving placebo. 
Summary statistics for TEAEs were largely similar in the PRIMA and NOVA studies, but some differences 
were noted when comparing the niraparib fixed dosing strategy in the PRIMA study with that of the NOVA 
study: more patients in the PRIMA trial experienced TEAEs leading to dose interruptions and TEAEs 
leading to dose reductions (84% and 76%, respectively) compared to patients in the NOVA study (69% 
and 69%, respectively). Slightly more patients receiving niraparib in the NOVA trial experienced a TEAE 
leading to drug withdrawal (17%) compared to patients receiving the niraparib fixed dosing regimen in 
the PRIMA trial (11%).

Adverse drug reactions 
Adverse drug reactions in the PRIMA study were evaluated using relative risk assessment for the 
niraparib treatment arm versus the placebo arm in addition to medical-pharmacological assessment of 
ADRs. 
The relative risk and 95% confidence interval (CI) were provided for TEAEs reported in ≥1% of patients 
and Grade ≥3 TEAEs reported in ≥1% of patients in either treatment arm, respectively (CSR, data not 
shown). Based on the TEAE rates observed in patients who received placebo, the population enrolled in 
this study had a high background rate of TEAEs related to the burden of prior chemotherapy and disease.  
No new ADRs were identified in PRIMA as compared to previous studies with niraparib. 
Adverse reactions (ADRs) of all grades occurring in ≥ 10 % of the 851 patients receiving Zejula 
monotherapy in the pooled PRIMA (either 200 mg or 300 mg starting dose) and NOVA trials were nausea, 
anaemia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, constipation, vomiting, headache, insomnia, platelet count 
decreased, neutropenia, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, diarrhoea, dyspnoea, hypertension, 
asthenia, dizziness, neutrophil count decreased, cough, arthralgia, back pain, white blood cell count 
decreased, and hot flush. 
The incidence of the most common ADRs and laboratory abnormalities in the PRIMA study (i.e., ADRs 
occurring in ≥10% of patients, and laboratory abnormalities occurring in ≥25% of patients) were 
consistent with those previously identified in other niraparib studies. 
The adverse reactions noted in the group of patients who were administered a 200 mg starting dose of 
Zejula based on baseline weight or platelet count were of similar or lesser frequency compared to the 
group administered a fixed starting dose of 300 mg.

In the PRIMA and NOVA study pool, a total of 226 (33%) patients in the pooled niraparib group and 119 
(28%) patients in the pooled placebo group had died at the time of the data cutoff of 17 May 2019, and 5 
TEAEs leading to death were reported in niraparib-treated patients. No on-treatment deaths were 
reported in either study. 
In the PRIMA study, 2 patients treated with niraparib and 1 patient treated with placebo experienced 
TEAEs that led to death. The events leading to death were intestinal perforation (Patient in niraparib arm) 
which likely occurred secondary to bowel obstruction. This is a common sequela of high grade tubo-
ovarian cancer. The other event of pleural effusion (Patient in niraparib arm) was likely due to lung 
metastases. An event of intentional overdose with hydromorphone occurred in the placebo arm. None of 
these events were assessed as related to study treatment by the investigator. 
Between the previous DCO of 30 May 2016 and DCO of 17 May 2019, 3 niraparib patients in the NOVA 
study experienced TEAEs leading to death. Two patients died of AML; both these deaths were assessed as 
related to study drug. Refer to section on adverse events of special interest: MDS/AML for more 
information. Another patient died of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dyspnea, pneumonia, sepsis, 
and acute kidney injury; the events of sepsis and acute kidney injury were assessed as likely related to 
study drug. The case was confounded by pre-existing history of COPD. 
Other Significant Events 
In the PRIMA and NOVA studies, particular attention was paid to monitoring patients for AESIs, including 
MDS/AML, secondary primary malignancies other than MDS/AML, pneumonitis, and embryo-fetal toxicity. 
In addition to AESIs, myelosuppression events (thrombocytopenia events, anemia events, neutropenia 
events, leukopenia events, and pancytopenia events), hypertension events, and thromboembolic events 
were grouped for analysis as events of medical interest. These AESIs were selected based on the known 
safety profile of niraparib and other PARP inhibitors. 
MDS/AML 
Cases of myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia (MDS/AML) have been observed in patients 
treated with Zejula monotherapy or combination therapy in clinical trials and post-marketing. There are 
1,785 subjects who have been exposed to monotherapy niraparib treatment or maintenance in clinical 
trials as of DCO 17 May 2019. MDS/AML events data from PRIMA (N=728; niraparib: 484 and placebo: 
244) is presented in context with data from QUADRA (N=463; niraparib), NOVA (N=546; niraparib: 367 
and placebo: 179) and with pooled clinical data of subjects exposed to niraparib monotherapy treatment 
or maintenance in other clinical studies (N=536; niraparib: 471 and physician’s choice: 65) as of 17 May 
2019 data cutoff.  
As of DCO 17 May 2019, 15 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and/or acute myeloid leukemia 
(AML) have been reported in clinical trials in patients who received niraparib.  
Germline BRCA status was not available for all subjects across the clinical trials; therefore, the incidence 
of MDS and/or AML in subjects who are BRCAmut vs. BRCA wild type was not evaluated. 
In the PRIMA study, 1 new case of MDS/AML was reported. One niraparib patient with a homologous 
recombination-deficient tumor experienced MDS reported as Grade 4 on study. In the NOVA study, a total 
of 14 reports of MDS/AML have been reported since study start.

Monotherapy Clinical Program (DCO: 17 May 2019) 
Second Primary Malignancies Other Than Myelodysplastic Syndrome and Acute Myeloid 
Leukemia 
In the PRIMA study, a total of 7 new malignancies other than MDS/AML were reported. The incidence of 
new malignancies other than MDS/AML was similar in the niraparib arm (4 of 484 patients, <1%) and the 
placebo arm (3 of 244 patients, 1%). In the PRIMA and NOVA study pool, the analysis identified 9 (1%) 
patients in the pooled niraparib group and 4 (1%) patients in the pooled placebo group with events in this 
category. There was no specific trend suggesting a different frequency for any given type of tumor in 
pooled niraparib vs pooled placebo patients.  
Pneumonitis 
A total of 5 patients (1%) treated with niraparib in the PRIMA study experienced pneumonitis events 
compared to no patients who received placebo. All events were Grade 1 or 2 in intensity and reported as 
serious as instructed per study protocol. Two patients were diagnosed with pneumonitis based on routine 
study imaging, and 2 were diagnosed due to symptoms of dyspnea, cough, or chest pain. Events led to 
dose interruption/reduction in 1 patient, drug withdrawn in 1 patient, and no change in 2 patients. Three 
patients  experienced Grade 2 events that were assessed as related or possibly related to study 
treatment.  
In the NOVA study, 4 events in the pneumonitis category were identified. Pneumonitis events were 
reported in 3/367 (1%) patients in the niraparib group and in 1/179 (<1%) patient in the placebo group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/531223/2020 
Page 136/168 
 
 
  
  
 
All events were Grade 1 or 2. One patient who received niraparib in the NOVA study experienced a 
nonserious pneumonitis event that was assessed likely related to study treatment. All other pneumonitis 
events were considered unrelated to study treatment. 
Embryo-Foetal Toxicity 
In the PRIMA and NOVA study pool, a total of 4 events were reported in this category. None of the 
4 terms (chloasma [verbatim term: melasma], gene mutation [verbatim term: vaginal gene defect], 
ichthyosis, and mastitis) were reported for women of childbearing potential or were associated with 
pregnancies; therefore, these events are not considered embryo-fetal toxicities. All 4 events were 
considered by the Investigator as unrelated to study drug. 
Hypertension 
In the PRIMA study, the incidence of hypertension events in patients receiving niraparib was 18% 
(87/484 patients). In comparison, 7% of patients receiving placebo experienced hypertension events. 
Grade 3/4 hypertension occurred in 6% of Zejula-treated patients compared to 1% of placebo-treated 
patients with a median time from first dose to first onset of 50 days (range: 1 to 589 days) and with a 
median duration of 12 days (range: 1 to 61 days. Treatment was not withdrawn due to grade 3/4 events. 
In the individualized starting dose group, the rate of Grade ≥3 hypertension was 5% in patients in the 
niraparib arm compared to 2% in the placebo arm. 
One patient treated with niraparib experienced a hypertension event Grade 3 that was reported as an 
SAE; none of the patients who received placebo experienced a hypertension event that was reported as 
an SAE. 
Eight patients in the niraparib arm (2%) underwent dose interruption and 4 (1%) underwent dose 
reduction for hypertension. No patients were discontinued from study drug due to hypertension. No 
events of hypertensive crisis were reported in the PRIMA study. 
Overall, in the PRIMA and NOVA study pool, hypertension was reported as a TEAE in 144 (21%) of the 
682 patients in the niraparib pooled group and in 27 (6%) of the 423 patients in the placebo pooled 
group. Grade ≥3 hypertension was reported in 54 (8%) of the 682 patients, Grade ≥3 hypertensive 
crisis was reported in 2 (<1%) patients, and Grade ≥3 blood pressure increased was reported in 1 
(<1%) patient in the pooled niraparib group compared with 7 patients (2%) with Grade ≥3 hypertension 
and no Grade ≥3 hypertensive crisis or Grade ≥3 blood pressure increased in the pooled placebo group. 
A review of increases from baseline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the PRIMA study revealed 
that the changes occurred during the first 15 days of treatment. 
Thromboembolic events 
In the PRIMA study, 3 (0.6%) patients experienced thromboembolic events in the niraparib arm 
compared with 1 (0.4%) patient in the placebo arm. All 3 thromboembolic events in the niraparib arm 
were reported as Grade ≥3; no Grade ≥3 events were reported in the placebo arm. The Grade ≥3 
thromboembolic events included singular TEAE reports of pulmonary embolism, embolism, and 
thrombosis. None of the 3 events was assessed as related to niraparib by Investigator.  
In the PRIMA and NOVA study pool, 11 (2%) pooled niraparib patients experienced thromboembolic 
events compared with 2 (0.5%) placebo patients. Of these, 6 (1%) pooled niraparib patients and no 
placebo patients experienced events that were considered Grade ≥3.

rate of thrombocytopenia events by PEY was 0.92 for patients who received niraparib and 0.05 for those 
who received placebo. 39% of Zejula-treated patients experienced Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia 
compared to 0.4% of placebo-treated patients with a median time from first dose to first onset of 22 days 
(range: 15 to 335 days) and with a median duration of 6 days (range: 1 to 374 days).  
21 (4%) patients had treatment with niraparib withdrawn due to a thrombocytopenia event, all of these 
were of Grade ≥3. No patients in the placebo group withdrew treatment due to thrombocytopenia. 
Thrombocytopenia events were reported as SAEs in 79 (16%) patients who received niraparib; none of 
the patients who received placebo experienced a thrombocytopenia event that was reported as an SAE. 
FSD vs ISD 
203 patients (73%) experienced a thrombocytopenia event in the FSD group, compared to 91 patients 
(53%) in the ISD group. The rate of Grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia events was 48% in patients who 
received the fixed starting dose compared to 21% in patients who received the individualized starting 
dose.   
Characterization of Thrombocytopenia Events 
In the PRIMA study, thrombocytopenia events generally occurred early during niraparib treatment (during 
Cycle 1) with the incidence decreasing rapidly thereafter; during Month 1 of niraparib therapy, the 
incidence of overall thrombocytopenia events was 53% (258 of 484 patients); this decreased to 8% (34 
of 454 patients) during Month 2 and then was <5% for Months 3, 4, 5, and ≥6. 
At study baseline in the PRIMA study, 94% of patients in the niraparib and placebo arms had platelet 
laboratory values in the normal range; Grade 1 thrombocytopenia was noted in 6% of patients in each 
arm. In the niraparib arm, shifts to Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 181 (38%) of the 483 
patients who had baseline and post-baseline results. No patient in the placebo arm had a shift to Grade 3 
or 4 thrombocytopenia on treatment. 
Mean decreases in platelets were observed during Cycle 1 in patients treated with niraparib, with 
recovery noted starting at Cycle 2. By Cycle 5, mean platelet counts were near baseline and remained 
stable in the niraparib arm for the remainder of the study. 
Management of thrombocytopenia 
In general, thrombocytopenia events were manageable with few patients discontinuing study drug due to 
these TEAEs; 21 patients (4%) who received niraparib and no patients who received placebo had study 
drug withdrawn as a result of thrombocytopenia. As required by protocol, study drug interruptions and 
dose reductions were mandated for patients with low platelet counts. Also per protocol, platelet 
transfusions may have been considered for patients with platelet count ≤10,000/μL. Overall, 94 patients 
(19%) required platelet transfusions. 67 patients (14%) requiring a platelet transfusion had platelet 
counts <10,000/ μL. All of the platelet transfusions were in patients receiving niraparib. 
In the niraparib arm, study drug interruption for these events occurred in 269 patients (56%) and dose 
reduction occurred in 229 patients (47%). There were no study drug interruptions or dose reductions for 
thrombocytopenia for patients who received placebo.  
Anaemia events 
Anaemia events include reports of anemia, anemia macrocytic, hemoglobin decreased, red blood cell 
count decreased, and hematocrit decreased.  
Incidence of anaemia events 
In the PRIMA study, a total of 311 patients (64%) treated with niraparib experienced an anemia event 
Assessment report  
EMA/531223/2020 
Page 139/168 
 
 
  
  
 
compared with 43 patients (18%) who received placebo (Table 71). The incidence rate of anemia events 
by PEY was 1.68 for patients who received niraparib and 0.26 for those who received placebo. 
In PRIMA, 31% of Zejula-treated patients experienced Grade 3/4 anaemia compared to 2% of placebo-
treated patients with a median time from first dose to first onset of 80 days (range: 15 to 533 days) and 
with a median duration of 7 days (range: 1 to 119 days). 5 patients (1%) had treatment with niraparib 
withdrawn due to these Grade 3/4 events. In contrast, no patients treated with placebo had their 
treatment withdrawn due to an anaemia event. Anaemia events were reported as SAEs in 27 patients 
(6%) treated with niraparib and in none of the patients who received placebo. Overall, 9 patients (2%) 
who received niraparib and no patients who received placebo had study drug withdrawn as the result of 
anemia. 
ISD vs FSD 
The rate of Grade ≥3 anemia events was 36% in patients who received the fixed starting dose as 
compared to 23% in patients who received the individualized starting dose. The PEY adjusted incidence 
rate of anaemia events (regardless of grade) was 2.02 in the FSD subgroup and 1.16 in the ISD 
subgroup. 
Characterisation of anaemia events 
At study entry in the PRIMA study, most patients had Grade 0 or 1 hemoglobin concentrations; 2% of 
patients in the niraparib arm and 3% of patients in the placebo arm entered the study with Grade 2 
anemia. In the niraparib arm, shifts to Grade 3 anemia occurred in 140 (29%) of the 483 patients with 
baseline and post-baseline data available. Only 3 patients (1%) in the placebo arm had a shift to Grade 3 
anemia. None of the patients in either the niraparib or placebo arms had laboratory shifts to Grade 4 
anemia. 
In the PRIMA study, the onset of anemia events tended to occur early during niraparib treatment with the 
incidence decreasing over time; during Month 1 of niraparib therapy, the incidence of anemia events was 
31% (148 of 484 patients); this decreased to 11% (50 of 454 patients) during Month 2 and 13% (55 of 
437 patients) during Month 3. The incidence was 8%, 1%, and 6% for Months 4, 5, and ≥6, respectively. 
As shown in Figure 49, decreases in hemoglobin were observed starting during Cycle 1 of niraparib 
treatment; mean hemoglobin levels remained below baseline until approximately Cycles 6-7.

Management of anaemia 
Overall, anaemia events in the PRIMA study were manageable, with few patients discontinuing study drug 
due to these TEAEs; 9 patients (2%) who received niraparib and no patients who received placebo had 
study drug withdrawn as the result of anemia. As required by the protocol, study drug interruptions and 
dose reductions were employed for patients with low hemoglobin levels. In the niraparib arm, study drug 
interruption for anemia events occurred in 152 patients (31%) who received niraparib and study drug 
dose reduction occurred in 131 patients (27%). Two patients (<1%) who received placebo experienced a 
dose interruption and 2 patients (<1%) experienced a dose reduction due to these events. 
Leukopenia events 
Leukopenia events include reports of neutropenia, neutrophil count decreased, white blood cell count 
decreased, leukopenia, lymphocyte count decreased, lymphopenia, febrile neutropenia, eosinophil count 
decreased, neutropenic sepsis, and monocyte count decreased. 
Incidence of leukopenia events 
In the PRIMA study, a total of 241 patients (50%) treated with niraparib experienced a leukopenia event 
compared with 32 patients (13%) who received placebo (Table 71). The incidence rate of leukopenia 
events by PEY was 0.15 for patients who received niraparib and 0.07 for those who received placebo. 
Among niraparib patients in the PRIMA study, 105 (22%) experienced a Grade 3 or 4 leukopenia event. 
In contrast, 4 (2%) placebo patients experienced a Grade 3/4 leukopenia event. Leukopenia events were 
reported as SAEs in 11 patients (2%) who received niraparib; none ofthe patients who received placebo 
experienced a leukopenia event that was reported as an SAE.  
FSD vs ISD 
The rate of Grade ≥3 leukopenia events was 25% in patients who received the fixed starting dose of 
niraparib compared to 16% in patients who received the individualized starting dose. PEY-adjusted 
leukopenia rates (all grades) were similar in the two niraparib dosing subgroups. 
Characterisation of leukopenia events 
In the PRIMA study, leukopenia events tended to occur early during niraparib treatment, with the 
Assessment report  
EMA/531223/2020

incidence decreasing over time; the overall incidence of leukopenia events during Month 1 of niraparib 
therapy was 33% (158 of 484 patients); this decreased to 13% (57 of 454 patients) during Month 2 and 
then was <3% for months 3, 4, 5, and ≥6. 
Management of leukopenia 
Overall, leukopenia events were manageable, with few patients discontinuing study drug due to these 
TEAEs; 10 patients (2%) who received niraparib and no patients who received placebo had study drug 
withdrawn as the result of a leukopenia event. In the niraparib arm, study drug interruption occurred in 
97 patients (20%) and dose reduction occurred in 68 patients (14%). Study drug interruption and 
reduction for leukopenia events were uncommon for patients who received placebo (<2% each). 
Neutropenia events 
Neutropenia events include neutropenia, neutrophil count decreased, neutropenic sepsis, and febrile 
neutropenia Table 60. 
Incidence of neutropenia events 
In the PRIMA study, a total of 205 patients (42%) treated with niraparib experienced a neutropenia event 
compared to 19 patients (8%) who received placebo (Table 71). The incidence rate of neutropenia events 
by PEY was 0.39 for patients who received niraparib and 0.09 for those who received placebo. Febrile 
neutropenia was reported in 4 (1%) niraparib patients and in no placebo patient. 
21% of Zejula-treated patients experienced Grade 3/4 neutropenia compared to 1% of placebo-treated 
patients with a median time from first dose to first onset of 29 days (range: 15 to 421 days) and with a 
median duration of 8 days (range: 1 to 42 days). Neutropenia events were reported as SAEs in 11 
patients (2%) treated with niraparib and none of the patients who received placebo. 
FSD vs ISD 
The rate of Grade ≥3 neutropenia events was 24% in patients who received a fixed starting dose 
compared to 15% in patients who received an individualized starting dose. No remarkable differences in 
PEY-adjusted neutropenia rates (all grades) were seen for patients receiving niraparib in the 
individualised dosing group (0.34) compared to the fixed dosing subgroup (0.28). 
Characterisation of neutropenia events 
In the PRIMA study, neutropenia events tended to occur early during niraparib treatment with the 
incidence decreasing over time; as the number of patients discontinuing treatment due to this event was 
low, this decrease in incidence is consistent with the toxicity being manageable with dose modifications. 
The overall incidence of neutropenia events during Month 1 of niraparib therapy was 26% (128 of 484 
patients); this decreased to 13% (59 of 454 patients) during Month 2 and then was ≤2% for Months 3, 
4, 5, and ≥6.  
Most patients in both treatment arms had Grade 0 or 1 neutrophil counts at study entry; Grade 2 
neutropenia was noted in approximately 2% of patients in each treatment arm at baseline. In the 
niraparib arm, shifts to Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred in 112 (23%) of the 483 patients who had 
baseline and post-baseline results. Only 2 patients in the placebo arm had a shift from baseline to a 
Grade 3 neutropenia on treatment. Decreases in neutrophils were observed starting during Cycle 1 of 
niraparib treatment; mean neutrophil levels remained below baseline until approximately Cycles 4-5. 
Management of neutropenia 
In the PRIMA study, study drug interruption occurred in 93 patients (19%) who receive niraparib and 
dose reduction occurred in 65 (13%). Study drug interruption and reduction for neutropenia events were 
uncommon for patients who received placebo (~1% each). 
Assessment report  
EMA/531223/2020 
Page 142/168 
 
 
  
  
 
Discontinuations due to neutropenia were reported in 9 patients (2%) who received niraparib and no 
patients who received placebo. 
Pancytopenia events 
Pancytopenia events included reports of pancytopenia, aplastic anemia, bone marrow failure, and MDS. 
Incidence of pancytopenia events 
Two pancytopenia events (<1%) were reported during the PRIMA study (Table 71) and both were in 
patients with homologous recombination-deficient tumors in the niraparib arm and reported as Grade 3 or 
4 SAEs. The pancytopenia events included 1 TEAE report of MDS and 1 report of pancytopenia. Both 
events were reported in patients who received the fixed starting dose. The case of MDS is considered 
under the MDS/AML heading above.  
Characterisation of pancytopenia events 
During Month 1 of niraparib therapy, the incidence of overall pancytopenia events in pooled niraparib 
patients (PRIMA and NOVA studies) was <1% (3 of 682 patients, respectively). No events occurred 
during Months 2, 3, 4, and 5, and the incidence was 1% (7 in 492 patients) for Months ≥6. 
Management of pancytopenia 
No patients in the PRIMA trial withdrew from treatment with niraparib due to pancytopenia. The action 
taken in the patient with pancytopenia was reported as dose reduced from 300 mg QD to the 100 mg QD 
dose level.  In the NOVA trial, a total of 5 (1%) patients discontinued study drug as a result of 
pancytopenia events; all pancytopenia events leading to study drug discontinuation occurred in the 
niraparib group, and all were Grade ≥3. Study drug interruption for pancytopenia events occurred in 3 
(<1%) pooled niraparib patients and no pooled placebo patients while dose reductions occurred in 2 
(<1%) pooled niraparib patients and no pooled placebo patients. 
Analysis of other adverse events 
Other TEAEs that were reported with a higher incidence rate (≥10%) in niraparib patients than in placebo 
patients included nausea, constipation, vomiting, fatigue, headache, decreased appetite and insomnia. 
Similar incidence rates were noted for these TEAEs when considering the PRIMA study and the PRIMA and 
NOVA study pool. 
In general, gastrointestinal disorders were reported with a higher incidence rate in pooled niraparib 
patients than in pooled placebo patients (90% vs 72%). The most commonly reported gastrointestinal 
TEAEs in niraparib patients with corresponding incidence in placebo patients were nausea (68% vs 31%), 
constipation (42% vs 20%), and vomiting (31% vs 14%). The majority of these events were Grade 1 or 2 
in severity, and these gastrointestinal events were serious or resulted in study drug discontinuation in ≤
1% of niraparib patients. 
Fatigue was reported in 288 (42%) niraparib patients and in 130 (31%) placebo patients; the events 
were assessed by the Investigator as Grade ≥3 in 4% of niraparib patients and in <1% of placebo 
patients. All but one event of fatigue in a niraparib patient were considered nonserious; in 12 (2%) of 
niraparib patients and in none of the placebo patients, the event of fatigue resulted in discontinuation of 
study drug. 
Headache was reported in 193 (28%) niraparib patients and in 57 (14%) placebo patients. The majority 
of these events were Grade 1 or 2 in severity, except in 3 (<1%) niraparib patients. All events of 
Assessment report

headache were considered nonserious, and TEAEs of headache resulted in study drug discontinuation in 4 
(<1%) niraparib patients and in none of the placebo patients. 
Insomnia was reported in 175 (26%) niraparib patients and in 51 (12%) placebo patients. The majority of 
events of insomnia were Grade 1 or 2 in severity; 5 patients who received niraparib and 1 of the patients 
who received placebo experienced Grade ≥3 events of insomnia. All but 1 event of insomnia in niraparib 
patient were considered nonserious, and insomnia resulted in study drug discontinuation in 3 (<1%) 
niraparib patients and in 1 (<1%) placebo patient. 
Decreased appetite was reported in 157 (23%) niraparib patients and in 47 (11%) placebo patients. The 
majority of these events were Grade 1 or 2 in severity; all but one event of decreased appetite in a 
placebo patient were considered nonserious. Events of decreased appetite resulted in study drug 
discontinuation in 5 (<1%) niraparib patients and none of the placebo patients. 
Laboratory findings 
Hematology 
Changes in hematology laboratory values were expected over the course of treatment given the known 
safety profile of niraparib from completed and ongoing single-agent clinical studies and of other PARP 
inhibitors. Changes from baseline in platelet count, hemoglobin concentrations, neutrophil counts, and 
leukocyte counts are discussed with the corresponding medically significant hematologic events above. 
Results of shift analyses for platelet count, hemoglobin concentrations, neutrophil counts, and leukocyte 
counts are discussed with the corresponding AESI. 
Blood chemistry 
There were no clinically meaningful changes from baseline for blood chemistry parameters during the 
study for both PRIMA and NOVA. Summaries of shift analyses from baseline to maximum on-treatment 
CTCAE grade were conducted for blood chemistry parameters. The incidence of shifts to Grade 3 or 4 
abnormalities was low for each clinical chemistry parameter examined. 
Potential Hy’s law cases 
One patient in the niraparib arm met the criteria for drug-induced liver injury in the PRIMA study, based 
on elevated AST, ALT, and bilirubin values. The patient received the 300 mg startdose. Elevations up to 
Grade 3 in ALT and AST were noted. Total bilirubin was above the upper limit of normal. The patient 
developed toxic hepatitis (grade 2-3) after about 8 months on the study. Metastases in the liver were 
identified, which is a confounding factor. 
In the pooled niraparib group, 4 patients had elevations of ALT >10×ULN to ≤20×ULN and 2 patients 
had elevations of AST >10×ULN to ≤20×ULN; no pooled placebo patients had elevations in ALT or AST 
>10×ULN to ≤20×ULN. No patient in the pooled niraparib group had elevations of AST or ALT >20×ULN, 
but one patient in the niraparib individualized dose group and 1 patient in the pooled placebo group had 
elevations of AST and ALT >20×ULN. 
Five niraparib patients and 3 placebo patients in the pooled niraparib group experienced elevations in 
bilirubin to >2×ULN and 90 niraparib patients and 17 placebo patients had elevations in ALP to 
>1.5×ULN. In addition, one patient in the niraparib individualised dose group experienced elevation in 
bilirubin to >2×ULN and 4 patients in the ISD group had elevations in ALP to >1.5×ULN. No events 
related to increased ALT, AST, ALP, or bilirubin increases led to discontinuation of treatment. 
In the NOVA study, 4 potential candidates for Hy’s Law were identified based on elevated AST,ALT, and 
bilirubin values, 1 in the placebo arm and 3 in the niraparib arm. The case in the placebo arm was related

to high doses of paracetamol. Two of the cases in the niraparib arm were diagnosed as cholestasis due to 
disease progression, and one case was an event of cholecystitis that resulted in cholecystectomy, 
subsequent biliary tract damage and liver failure. None of the cases in the NOVA trial met the criteria for 
Hy’s law. 
Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic factors 
There were no clinically meaningful differences in the overall incidence of TEAEs and SAEs, treatment-
related TEAEs, TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation, specific AESIs, or Grade ≥3 AESIs based on 
age or race.  
 Extrinsic factors 
There were no clinically meaningful differences in the overall incidence of TEAEs and SAEs, treatment-
related TEAEs, TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation, specific AESIs, or Grade ≥3 AESIs based on 
number of prior chemotherapy courses. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The effect of other drugs on niraparib across the niraparib program is described in the initial niraparib 
marketing application and labeling. Because of the minimal risk of drug interactions, no specific drug-drug 
interaction studies were provided with this application.

Post marketing experience 
As described in the Periodic Safety Update Report No. 04 (data lock point 26 September 2019; Procedure 
no.: EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010655/201909), information relating to the benefit-risk profile of niraparib 
received in the reporting period of 27 March 2019 to 26 September 2019 has been reviewed and an 
overall assessment of risk has been made.  
Based on sales figures and an assumed average daily dose of 200 mg (2 x 100-mg capsules), post-
approval exposure during the time period 01-Jan-2019 to 30-Jun-2019 is estimated to be 1,385 patient-
years. The algorithm used to derive post-approval exposure data is total number of capsules/2 x 365. 
This brings the cumulative exposure to 3,158 patient-years. 
The results and conclusions from evaluations completed during the period for photosensitivity reaction, 
posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) and hypertensive crisis/malignant hypertension 
have been referred to the MAH safety governance and labelling boards for review and to inform action(s) 
to be taken, as applicable. Based upon the review of the post-marketing data for PSUR No. 4, no new 
safety concerns and/or new significant information was observed for the important identified risk or 
important potential risks which would alter the known safety profile of niraparib.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The primary data to support the safety of treatment with niraparib in the proposed indication were 
derived from the ongoing PRIMA study (PR-30-5017-C), where 733 patients were randomised 2:1 to 
receive niraparib or placebo. A total of 484 patients received niraparib, including 315 patients who 
received a fixed starting dose of niraparib (300 mg), and 169 patients who received individualized 
starting doses of niraparib (200 mg or 300 mg) based on baseline body weight and platelet count; 244 
patients received placebo. After introduction of the individualised dosing regimen, 13 patients out of 258 
(5%) received an incorrect starting dose. This is not considered to impact on the safety data analyses.   
The median overall treatment duration from the first to last dose was longer for patients in the niraparib 
group (11.1 months) compared to the placebo group (8.3 months). The median dose intensity (relative 
dose intensity) was 181 mg/day (63%) in the niraparib arm overall, consistent with the severe AE profile 
of niraparib which was managed by dose modifications. The overall exposure to niraparib and placebo in 
the PRIMA study is considered sufficient for a comparison of safety in the sought indication. Supportive 
safety data from the ongoing NOVA study (the basis of the initial MA application) were also presented. 
In the PRIMA study, demographic and disease characteristics were generally well balanced between the 
niraparib and placebo arms. The median age was 62 years (range: 32 to 88 years), and 11% and 9% of 
niraparib and placebo patients, respectively, were ≥ 75 years of age. 69% of niraparib patients and 71% 
of placebo patients had an ECOG performance status of 0. The population baseline characteristics were 
also well balanced between ISD group and FSD group with regard to the median age, the proportion of ≥
75 years old patients, body weight baseline mean and ECOG status. The mean platelet count in the fixed-
dose group was similar to that in the individualized-dose group (248.4 ×109/L, vs. 240.1×109/L 
respectively). There were no remarkable differences in history of prior myelosuppression between 
patients who received a fixed starting dose compared with those who received an individualized starting 
dose in either treatment arm.  
Overall, the most frequently reported AEs for niraparib in the PRIMA study were consistent with the 
known safety profile and included haematological and gastrointestinal events such as anaemia (63%), 
nausea (57%), thrombocytopenia (46%), and constipation (39%). The most frequently reported Grade 
3/4 AEs in patients receiving niraparib were consistent with the known safety profile, i.e. anaemia (31%), 
thrombocytopenia (29%) and hypertension (6%). Consistent with the NOVA study, haematological events 
(thrombocytopenia, anaemia) were also the AEs generally responsible for frequent dose modifications. 
Dose interruptions occurred in 80% of patients in the niraparib group and dose reductions in 75%. In the 
placebo group, 24% and 12% of patients had a dose interruption and dose reduction (all reasons), 
respectively. Treatment discontinuations occurred in 12% overall in niraparib-treated patients. 
Review of the data from the PRIMA study across cohorts for TEAE all grade and CTCAE grade ≥3 incidence 
shows that the results for the niraparib arm in general were similar in the HRD-positive cohort and overall 
(data not shown).  
In the PRIMA study, 32% of the patients who received niraparib and 13% of the patients who received 
placebo experienced treatment emergent SAEs. The most common SAEs reported in niraparib-treated 
patients were consistent with the observed severe safety profile: thrombocytopenia (12%), anaemia 
(6%), and platelet count decreased (4%). 
No on-treatment deaths were observed in the PRIMA study, but two deaths from TEAEs occurred 
(intestinal perforation and pleural effusion) in niraparib-treated patients in the PRIMA study; none were 
considered as related to study treatment. The pleural effusion was clearly due to disease progression 
Assessment report  
EMA/531223/2020 
Page 147/168 
 
 
  
  
and/or infection and there was no evidence that any niraparib-induced lung toxicity could have caused 
the patient's condition to worsen and then lead to a fatal outcome. 
Between the DCO date of 30 May 2016 and DCO of 17 May 2019, 3 patients who received niraparib in the 
NOVA study experienced TEAEs leading to death considered related to treatment with niraparib: two 
events of AML and one death due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dyspnea, pneumonia, sepsis, 
and acute kidney injury. The events of sepsis and acute kidney injury were assessed as likely related to 
study drug by the investigator.  
Overall, 15 cases of MDS/AML have been observed in the niraparib monotherapy clinical program as of 
the DCO date 17 May 2019. The incidence was slightly higher in the niraparib-treated patients compared 
to placebo-treated patients: 15 cases (0.8%) vs 3 cases (0,6%), respectively. Exposure to chemotherapy 
is a confounding factor, as all the patients have received at least one previous chemotherapy regimen.  
The risk of MSD/AML with niraparib appears consistent with that reported for other PARP inhibitors, e.g. 
olaparib, and is described in SmPC section 4.4 of approved PARP inhibitor products, including  the 
niraparib SmPC. Since MDS/AML diagnosis and progression may take years to develop after treatment 
initiation, the incidence of MDS/AML in the PRIMA trial is likely to rise with longer follow-up times. The 
duration of Zejula treatment in patients prior to developing MDS/AML varied from 0.5 months 
to > 4.9 years. The incidences of MDS/AML across the niraparib monotherapy trials is probably influenced 
by different exposures to niraparib and other DNA-damaging agents and varying follow-up times. 
MDS/AML is listed in the RMP as an important potential risk with niraparib. The MAH has committed to 
continuing to monitor MDS and/or AML, in addition to other secondary primary malignancies, through 
routine pharmacovigilance activities and the two category 3 post-authorization safety studies.  
Pneumonitis was previously classified as an important potential risk with niraparib in the RMP. 5/484 
patients on niraparib experienced pneumonitis events in the PRIMA trial and 3/367 experienced 
pneumonitis events in the NOVA trial (incidence 1% in both trials), compared to 1/423 patients in 
placebo-treated patients (incidence 0,2%). All events were grade 1 or 2 in intensity. Half of the events in 
niraparib-treated patients were considered as possibly, likely, or related to study treatment by the 
investigator. Pneumonitis has recently been included in section 4.8 of the SmPC after assessment of the 
available evidence (EMEA/H/C/004249/II/0020) and will continue to be monitored through routine 
pharmacovigilance.  
Embryo-foetal toxicity is a safety issue that will continue to be monitored through routine 
pharmacovigilance. No cases consistent with embryo-foetal toxicity have been reported in the PRIMA and 
NOVA trials. The product information for Zejula contains warnings in section 4.4. and 4.6 concerning use 
during pregnancy and recommendations for use of reliable contraceptive methods in women of 
childbearing potential.    
The incidence of hypertension events (all grade and ≥ grade 3) in patients treated with niraparib in 
PRIMA study was similar to the incidence in the niraparib pool (18% vs. 21% respectively). There was no 
difference in the incidence of TEAEs of hypertension between the individualised and fixed dosing 
subgroups. Hypertension is a very commonly occurring event with niraparib. The Zejula SmPC contains 
information concerning this risk, including a precautionary text for hypertension and hypertensive crisis in 
section 4.4. Guidance for blood pressure monitoring is included, which is considered sufficient.  
Cancer patients are at risk for thromboembolisms. A higher incidence of thromboembolic events was 
observed in niraparib-treated patients in the PRIMA and NOVA study pool compared to the placebo arms: 
11/682 (1.6%) vs 2/423 (0.5%), respectively. Six of the niraparib-treated patients and none of the 
placebo-treated patients experienced events that were of grade ≥3. None of the 9 events of 
thromboembolism which occurred in niraparib-treated patients in the NOVA study, were assessed as 
related to study drug. Although a higher incidence of thromboembolic events was observed in niraparib-
Assessment report  
EMA/531223/2020

treated patients in the PRIMA and NOVA studies compared to those treated with placebo, this is not 
considered sufficient evidence to suggest a causal relationship between niraparib and the adverse event 
of thromboembolism.  
Myelosuppression, including thrombocytopenia, is a main safety issue with niraparib. In the clinical 
programme, haematologic adverse reactions were managed with laboratory monitoring and dose 
modifications. The incidence of thrombocytopenia events was high in the PRIMA trial, including 
188 patients (39%) on niraparib experiencing grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia events, compared to none in 
the placebo group. 94 patients (19%) on niraparib treatment required a platelet transfusion, compared to 
none in the placebo-treated patients. Thrombocytopenia with niraparib occurs early. The mean decreases 
in platelets were observed during Cycle 1, with recovery noted starting at Cycle 2. By Cycle 5, mean 
platelet counts were near baseline and remained stable in the niraparib arm for the remainder of the 
study, corresponding to management through drug interruptions and dose reductions.  
Consistent with the known safety profile, high incidences of anaemia were seen with niraparib in the 
PRIMA trial (64%). 31% of patients in the niraparib group experienced grade ≥3 events. Anaemia 
appeared to be manageable in the PRIMA study, with relatively few patients in the niraparib group (2%) 
discontinuing treatment due to the event.  
In the PRIMA study, the proportion of patients treated with niraparib who experienced a leukopenia 
events was slightly higher compared to niraparib pool (50% vs. 44%). The SmPC was amended 
accordingly to consider leukopenia as a very common adverse reaction. Overall, leukopenia events were 
manageable, with few patients discontinuing study drug due to these TEAEs; 10 patients (2%). 
Pancytopenia is a potentially life-threatening ADR with niraparib. One PT of pancytopenia was reported in 
the niraparib FSD subgroup in the PRIMA trial, for which the action taken with the study drug was 
reported as dose reduced from 300 mg QD to 100 mg QD. In the NOVA study, 5 patients (1%) 
discontinued treatment with niraparib due to pancytopenia. Pancytopenia is included as and ADR in the 
Zejula SmPC section 4.8 with frequency uncommon and is also described under section 4.4 special 
warnings and precautions, haematologic adverse reactions, which is considered sufficient. If a patient 
develops severe persistent haematologic toxicity including pancytopenia that does not resolve within 
28 days following interruption, Zejula should be discontinued.  
Gastrointestinal disorders are among the main factors limiting the tolerability of niraparib. The most 
commonly reported gastrointestinal TEAEs in niraparib patients in the PRIMA and NOVA study pool with 
corresponding incidence in placebo patients were nausea (68% vs 31%), constipation (42% vs 20%), and 
vomiting (31% vs 14%). Although the majority of these events were Grade 1 or 2 in severity, patient 
reported outcomes from the PRIMA study confirm that gastrointestinal related quality of life scores are 
significantly worse for patient treated with niraparib compared to placebo (refer to clinical efficacy section 
5.4.2, subsection on patient reported outcomes).  
For nausea and fatigue, the incidence of adverse events was lower in PRIMA study compared to PRIMA 
and NOVA Study Pool. For headache, insomnia, the incidence of adverse events was almost similar in 
both. 
The incidence of decreased appetite adverse event in PRIMA was slightly lower (19%). The SmPC was 
amended to consider dysgeusia as common adverse event rather than very common. 
Overall, except for pneumonitis, no new ADRs were identified from review of the TEAEs reported in the 
PRIMA study, or from a review of the combined PRIMA and NOVA study populations. However, based on 
updated incidence rates in the NOVA and PRIMA study pool, some changes have been made to the SmPC:  
Assessment report  
EMA/531223/2020 
Page 149/168 
 
 
  
  
- 
The incidence of leukopenia events in patients who received the fixed starting dose was higher in 
PRIMA study compared to NOVA study (52.7% vs. 36.5%) and therefore leukopenia is considered 
as a very common adverse event. 
- 
The SmPC was amended to consider dysgeusia as common adverse event rather than very 
common. 
-  Based on updated incidence rates of grade ≥3 elevations in ALT for niraparib in the PRIMA and 
NOVA study pool, the SmPC was amended so as the ALT increase is considered common grade 
≥3 ADR. 
-  Dyspnoea and epistaxis are considered as uncommon grade ≥ 3 AE based on the available safety 
data.  
In the PRIMA trial, there has been one patient with an event of toxic hepatitis who met the criteria for 
drug induced liver injury, although liver metastases was a confounding factor. In the NOVA trial, there 
were three potential Hy’s law cases in niraparib-treated patients and one in a placebo-treated patient. 
None of the cases in the NOVA trial met the criteria for Hy’s law. Two of the cases in the niraparib arm 
were diagnosed as cholestasis due to disease progression. The Zejula SmPC contains information in 
section 4.8 of liver function test increases with niraparib, including AST increased, ALT increased, 
gamma-glutamyl transferase increased and blood alkaline phosphatase increased; as well as grade ≥ 3 
ADRs including GGT increased, ALT increased, AST increased and blood alkaline phosphatases increased. 
Currently, the evidence for DILI with niraparib is limited. Possible additional cases of DILI should be 
commented on in upcoming PSURs.  
More patients in the niraparib arm than the placebo arm discontinued due to adverse events (12% vs 
2%, respectively) in the PRIMA trial. The most common TEAEs leading to study drug withdrawal in 
niraparib treated patients were thrombocytopenia (4%), anaemia (2%), and nausea and neutropenia (1% 
each). None of the placebo patients were discontinued from study drug for these types of events. There 
were no notable differences in frequencies of TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation for patients 
receiving niraparib in the HRD+ cohort compared to the overall population (data not shown). 
Although no meaningful differences were noted overall in patients treated with niraparib based on age 
(<65 years vs ≥ 65 years), it is noted that few patients over 75 years have been treated with niraparib in 
the PRIMA and NOVA trials (60 patients, 9%, in the pooled niraparib population).  Very few patients 
treated with niraparib in the PRIMA and NOVA trials were non-white, so safety results by race are not 
assessable.  
Individualised vs. fixed starting dose 
Patients with lower body weight or lower baseline platelet count may be at increased risk of Grade 3+ 
thrombocytopenia. In the PRIMA study, patients were initially enrolled at a fixed starting dose (FSD) of 
300 mg QD niraparib or placebo. The dosing strategy was subsequently changed by a trial amendment, to 
an individualised starting dose (ISD), which is the proposed posology in the applied indication. Patients 
then received 200 mg QD niraparib or placebo, except for patients who weighed ≥ 77 kg and had 
baseline platelet count ≥ 150,000/µL, where the starting dose was 300 mg QD or placebo. Patients in the 
ISD subgroup had relatively fewer numbers of cycles and less overall and actual treatment exposure than 
those in the FSD subgroup. The introduction of the ISD at a later time point in the study also means that 
patients in the ISD group have a shorter follow-up time compared with patients in the FSD subgroup 
(11.1 months vs 16.6 months, respectively, as of the May 2019 DCO). The ISD subgroup was relatively 
small; 169 patients received treatment with niraparib under the ISD regimen. With the updated safety 
data with a DCO date 17 November 2019, the mean overall treatment duration was about 2 months 
longer than that included in the original dataset for both ISD and FSD groups. Only very minor changes 
Assessment report  
EMA/531223/2020 
Page 150/168 
 
 
  
  
were noted in the updated dataset compared to the original, and the results were consistent between the 
updated and original dataset.  
Dose reductions and dose interruptions were more frequent in the FSD group compared to the ISD group 
(80% and 84% vs 66% and 71%, respectively). Consistent with this, the median dose intensity (relative 
dose intensity) was similar in the ISD subgroup (179 mg/day, 66%) and the FSD subgroup (182 mg/day, 
61%) Fewer dose reductions and dose interruptions due to thrombocytopenia (17% vs 38% and 24% vs 
44%, respectively) and anaemia (20% vs 31% and 22% vs 36%, respectively) were seen in the ISD 
subgroup compared to the FSD subgroup. Dose modification per starting dose (200 mg vs 300 mg) over 
time supported an ameliorated dose modification profile of the 200 mg starting dose. In the low baseline 
weight/platelet dosing cohorts, dose interruptions and reductions dropped from 87% and 84% with the 
300 mg starting dose, respectively, to 68% and 60% respectively, with the 200 mg starting dose. Those 
patients who will receive 300 mg under the ISD dosing regime, however, can expect more dose 
interruptions and reductions compared to those patients receiving the 200 mg starting dose: about 50% 
of patients receiving the 300 mg starting dose needed a dose reduction in the second month of 
treatment, compared to about 28% of patients receiving the 200 mg starting dose. By month 10 of 
treatment, only about 10% of patients in the 300 mg ISD subgroup received a dose of 300 mg, whereas 
for those patients in the 200 mg ISD subgroup, about 40% were receiving the dose they were started on 
(200 mg).   
Although the protocol allowed for dose escalation to 300 mg after the first two treatment cycles, very few 
patients in the ISD subgroup had their dose escalated: 13 patients overall, 7 of these were in the 
niraparib arm. Of these 7, 3 experienced adverse events within 1-2 months after dose escalation which 
led to dose interruption and dose reduction in 2 patients. The last patient discontinued treatment due to 
disease progression. The low number of dose escalations could be expected, as in general, physicians 
may be wary of introducing toxicity when therapy is being tolerated. 
All of the common TEAEs (incidence rate ≥ 10%) were less commonly reported in patients who received 
an individualized starting dose compared to patients who received a fixed starting dose. The incidence of 
anaemia and thrombocytopenia fell: from 71% and 52% in the FSD subgroup, to 50% and 34% in the 
ISD subgroup, respectively. The incidence of other common TEAEs, such as nausea and vomiting, fell less 
from the FSD subgroup (60% and 25% respectively) to the ISD subgroup (53% and 17%, respectively). 
Due to the mentioned differences in exposure times between the ISD and FSD subgroups, interpretation 
of differences in incidences of TEAEs between the ISD and FSD groups should be done with caution.  
Exposure-adjusted incidence rates of the most commonly occurring TEAEs for the ISD and FSD groups 
indicate that the incidence rates per patient-exposure year (PEY) of anaemia and thrombocytopenia were 
almost twice as high in the FSD group (2.02 and 1.08, respectively) compared to the ISD group (1.16 
and 0.65, respectively). For other haematological events, however, the PEY adjusted incidence rates are 
generally similar for FSD and ISD subgroups.  
For other important TEAEs observed with niraparib, such as nausea, constipation and vomiting, only slight 
reductions in PEY adjusted incidence rates were observed in the ISD subgroup (1.45, 0.58, 0.27, 
respectively) compared to the FSD subgroup (1.63, 0.74, 0.34). The PEY adjusted incidence rate of 
fatigue was slightly higher in the ISD subgroup compared to the FSD subgroup (0.61vs 0.55, 
respectively). Unfortunately, gastrointestinal adverse events are among the main factors limiting the 
tolerability of niraparib. Patient reported outcomes from the PRIMA study confirm that gastrointestinal 
related quality of life scores were significantly worse in patients treated with niraparib compared to 
placebo. 
Fewer patients reported any grade ≥ 3 TEAE in the ISD group (60%) compared to the FSD group (76%). 
Patients who were administered a starting dose of Zejula based on baseline weight or platelet count, 
Assessment report  
EMA/531223/2020

Grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia, anaemia and neutropenia were reduced from 48% to 21%, 36% to 23% 
and 24% to 15%, respectively, compared to the group administered a fixed starting dose of 300 mg.  
Only relatively small differences between the subgroups in other reported grade ≥3 TEAEs were noted. 
Discontinuation due to thrombocytopenia, anaemia, and neutropenia occurred, respectively, in 3%, 3%, 
and 2% of patients. 
A larger proportion of patients reported any SAE in the FSD subgroup compared to the ISD subgroup 
(35% vs 27%). There was a considerable reduction in SAEs of thrombocytopenia in the ISD subgroup, 
which fell from 17% in the FSD subgroup to 4% in the ISD subgroup. SAEs of anaemia, however, were 
not reduced in the ISD subgroup (8%) compared to the FSD subgroup (4%).  
The assessment of differences in incidences for the most common TEAEs (≥10%), grade ≥ 3 TEAEs (≥5%) 
and SAEs between the ISD and FSD subgroups was not changed with receipt of updated safety data 
(including DCO date 17 November 2019). 
Since the main benefit in terms of an individualised starting dose over a fixed starting dose appears to be 
the reduced frequency of thrombocytopenia and, to some extent, anaemia events, the sequelae of 
thrombocytopenia and anaemia are of importance in determining potential patient benefit in terms of a 
lower starting dose of niraparib. In addition to the reduction of thrombocytopenia SAEs in the ISD 
subgroup, the incidence of platelet transfusions was substantially decreased in the niraparib ISD 
subgroup (6.5%) compared to the FSD subgroup (19%). A review of bleeding events occurring 
concurrently with thrombocytopenia and grade ≥2 fatigue events concurrent with anaemia in the 
niraparib FSD and ISD subgroups of the PRIMA study were provided. The rates of bleeding concurrent 
with thrombocytopenia were reported in 9% of the overall safety population in the PRIMA study. Rates of 
bleeding events concurrent with thrombocytopenia decreased from 18.9% in the subgroup of patients 
with low weight/platelets who were dosed with FSD 300 mg, to 5.7% in the ISD 200 mg subgroup. There 
was no difference in grade ≥2 fatigue events concurrent with anaemia between the starting dose cohorts. 
The data support that the reduced 200 mg starting dose shows clinically meaningful reductions in 
sequelae of thrombocytopenia compared to the 300 mg starting dose in the low weight/platelet patient 
population. 
As anaemia can lead to fatigue, analysis of grade ≥2 fatigue events occurring concurrently with anaemia 
was presented by the MAH.  Overall, concurrent grade ≥2 fatigue events with anaemia occurred similarly 
amongst the 4 dosing cohorts (12-21%). No reduction in the frequency of concurrent grade ≥2 fatigue 
events with anaemia was seen with the lower starting dose. 
In order to further characterize the extent of improved safety profile by lowering the starting dose, key 
safety parameters for 200 mg vs. 300 mg daily, were compared for these patients, using the most 
recently updated safety data (DCO 17 November 2019). The updated data were consistent with what was 
seen in the original dataset. Dose interruptions and dose reductions dropped from 87% and 84% with the 
300 mg starting dose, respectively, to 68% and 60% respectively, with the 200 mg starting dose. Non-
haematologic toxicity was not substantially reduced with the reduced starting dose, but grade 3/4 
haematological toxicities were reduced with the 200 mg starting dose. The most remarkable reduction 
was in grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia, which was reduced from 52% with the 300 mg starting dose to 17% 
with 200 mg starting dose in the low w/p population. Notably, grade 4 thrombocytopenia was reduced 
from 39% to 7%. The MAH pointed out that, based on clinical trial and real-world experience with 
niraparib, high-grade thrombocytopenia leads to hospitalisation, transfusions, interventions and early 
discontinuation of niraparib, which are mitigated with the individualised starting dose. It is agreed that 
the reduction in thrombocytopenia seen with the 200 mg starting dose in the low w/p population is 
substantial and is likely to represent a benefit for those patients who will receive it.

2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of niraparib in the proposed indication is severe and consistent with the known 
safety profile.  
The submitted data support clinically relevant advantages of the reduced starting dose of 200 mg QD 
compared to the currently approved starting dose of 300 mg QD in patients weighing less than 77 kg or 
having platelet counts lower than 150,000/µL. 
In addition, the MAH should discuss possible additional cases of DILI in the next PSURs (routine 
pharmacovigilance). 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC

being updated. The Package Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly. Annex II is also updated to add a new 
condition to the marketing authorisation. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Celsentri. The bridging report submitted by the MAH has 
been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed indication for Zejula (niraparib) is “for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with 
advanced high-grade ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete 
or partial) following completion of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.”  
Additionally, a different posology is sought for the new indication; all first line ovarian cancer patients 
should receive 200 mg daily as starting dose (except patients weighing ≥ 77 kg and having baseline 
platelet count ≥ 150,000/µl who should receive 300 mg daily). 
Ovarian cancer is the fifth overall cause of cancer death in women, representing 5% of all cancer deaths. 
Ovarian cancer is often asymptomatic in the early stages and is, therefore, first detected in advanced 
stages, when prognosis is poor (Fotopoulou 2014; Ovarian Cancer: Estimated Incidence, Mortality & 
Prevalence. WHO: International Agency for Research on Cancer 2016; Havrilesky et al. 2009). The 5-year 
overall survival (OS) rate in advanced ovarian cancer patients decreases from 42% for Stage IIIA, 32% 
for Stage IIIC, and 19% for Stage IV. 
The primary objective of the treatment is to prolong progression-free survival (PFS). Extending the time 
to progression and hence the next chemotherapy regimen without compromising the patient’s QoL can be 
regarded to be of clinical relevance also without an improvement in OS as long as there is no indication of 
detrimental effect on OS. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The paradigm for first-line treatment of newly diagnosed ovarian cancer includes a combination of 
surgery and chemotherapy: either primary debulking surgery (PDS) followed by adjuvant platinum-based 
(cisplatin or carboplatin) plus a taxane (paclitaxel or docetaxel) chemotherapy regimen or neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy (NACT) with subsequent interval debulking surgery (IDS) followed by additional 
chemotherapy (NCCN Ovarian 2019). Worldwide, the use of NACT is increasing in patients with large 
volume Stage IIIC/IV disease, such that, 45%-60% of these patients will receive NACT. 
Despite optimal upfront surgery and the administration of front-line paclitaxel–carboplatin chemotherapy, 
70% of patients will relapse in the first 3 years and become largely incurable (Ledermann et al., 2013). 
∼
Prolonging the benefit of first line platinum-based chemotherapy is currently the best chance these 
patients have to avoid recurrence and potentially improve survival outcomes.  
Assessment report  
EMA/531223/2020 
Page 157/168 
 
 
  
  
Targeted treatments approved, at present, in the first line setting include maintenance olaparib for 
BRCAm patients only and bevacizumab for frontline and maintenance therapy regardless of BRCAm 
status. There is a remaining unmet clinical need regarding the treatment of patients with advanced 
ovarian cancer, particularly for patients with advanced ovarian cancer with DNA repair deficiency (i.e., 
HRD positive) not induced by BRCA mutation, and patients with HR-proficient (i.e., HRD negative) 
tumours. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence of efficacy is a single, pivotal trial (PRIMA) which is an ongoing Phase 3, double-blind, 
randomized (2:1 niraparib to placebo), study of niraparib vs. placebo with an effective data cut-off date 
of 17 May 2019. The study randomised 733 (487 niraparib and 246 placebo) patients with Stage III or IV 
ovarian cancer (including fallopian and peritoneal cancers) who had previously completed front-line 
platinum-based therapy with a physician-assessed response of CR or PR.  
Randomisation was stratified by use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (yes or no), best response to platinum 
therapy (CR or PR), and tumour homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) status (positive or 
negative/not determined) as assessed by the myChoice assay. The primary efficacy endpoint in the 
PRIMA study was PFS, defined as the time from treatment randomisation to the earlier date of 
assessment of progression (by blinded central review) or death by any cause in the absence of 
progression. The primary endpoint, PFS by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), was tested 
hierarchically first in the HRDpos population and then in the ITT population by a stratified log-rank test at 
a one-sided 0.025 alpha level. 
A proportion of about 65% (473/733) of the study population had been dosed with a fixed starting dose 
of 300 mg in the PRIMA study when the protocol was amended to implement an alternative dosing 
strategy. This alternative posology postulated 200 mg as a starting dose for all patients, except for those 
weighing ≥ 77 kg and having a platelet count ≥ 150,000/µL; for these patients the starting dose was 300 
mg.   
3.2.  Favourable effects 
All patients, regardless of dosing strategy 
The primary endpoint PFS was met in the HRD positive (N=373; 247 in the niraparib group vs. 126 in the 
placebo group) with a HR of 0.43 (95% CI: 0.310 to 0.588, p<0.0001) in favour of the niraparib arm. 
The median PFS was 21.9 (95% CI: 19.3, NE) months for the niraparib arm versus 10.4 (95% CI: 8.1, 
12.1) months in the placebo arm. This represents a prolongation in PFS of 11.5 months. 
The primary endpoint PFS was met in the overall population (N=733; 487 in the niraparib group vs. 246 
in the placebo group) with a HR of 0.62 (95% CI: 0.505 to 0.755, p<0.0001) in favour of the niraparib 
arm. The median PFS was 13.8 (95% CI: 11.5, 14.9) months for the niraparib arm versus 8.2 (95% CI: 
7.3, 8.5) months in the placebo arm. This represents a prolongation in PFS of 5.6 months. 
Niraparib showed effect in the HRDneg subgroup (N=249; 169 in the niraparib group vs. 80 in the 
placebo group) with a HR of 0.68 (95% CI: 0.492, 0.944; p=0.0203) and median PFS of 8.1 (95% CI: 
5.7, 9.4) months in the niraparib arm vs. 5.4 (95% CI: 4.0, 7.3) months in the placebo arm. This 
represents a prolongation in PFS of 2.7 months. 
The result for the Overall population for time to first subsequent treatment (TFST) indicated a 
prolongation of 6.6 months for the niraparib arm compared to the placebo arm (18.6 months [15.8, 24.7] 
vs. 12.0 months [10.3, 13.9], respectively; HR= 0.65 [95% CI: 0.521, 0.802], p<0.0001).

Results of the sensitivity analyses for progression-free survival were consistent with the primary efficacy 
results in both the HRDpos population and Overall population. 
A PFS benefit of niraparib treatment over placebo with HR<1 was observed in the majority of subgroups, 
both in the HRDpos and overall population. The highest efficacy was observed in the BRCAmut subgroup 
(N=223) in the overall population with HR of 0.40 (95% CI: 0.265, 0.618; p<0.0001) and median PFS of 
22.1 months (95% CI: 19.3, NE) in the niraparib arm vs. median PFS of 10.9 months (95% CI: 8.0, 
19.4) in the placebo arm.

(* as the data for the individualised starting dose groups and the 200 mg dosing groups at data cut-off 
date 17 May 2019 were immature, only HRs were stated for these results).  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The dosing schedule of the PRIMA study was amended rather late in the course of the study. In total, 
approximately 25% (122/484) of the niraparib patients included in the study received the applied 200 mg 
dose in accordance with the algorithm based on body weight and/or platelet count. The PRIMA study was 
neither originally designed for testing multiple dosing strategies, nor powered to evaluate the treatment 
effect of the proposed lower starting dose of 200 mg. The candidate dosing strategies were not tested in 
parallel groups, but rather tested sequentially (prior to and after the time of the protocol amendment).  
Whether the treatment effect of the 200 mg dose is fully maintained in the Overall and HRDpos patient 
populations is uncertain. A reduction of the efficacy with a 200 mg dose in these patient populations 
cannot be entirely excluded, however the potential reduction in treatment effect is anticipated to be 
relatively modest.  
The exposure-response analyses did not indicate an exposure-response relationship over the range of 
exposures associated with 200 mg and 300 mg. However, due to limitations in the input data, mainly 
sparse PK sampling and a narrow exposure range under evaluation, they provide only limited 
supplementary evidence of efficacy at 200 mg. 
Assessment report  
EMA/531223/2020 
Page 160/168 
 
 
  
  
For the HRDneg population, the 200 mg dose appears to have a low treatment effect. It is doubted that 
the stated point estimate of HR 0.43 represents the true treatment effect of the 200 mg dose for this 
population. This is due to the fact that the HR point estimate is lower than the corresponding HR point 
estimate in the 300 mg dosing group for HRDneg and also lower than the point estimate of HR for 
HRDpos in subgroup D (0.53). These results lack biological support. Adding to the uncertainties is also 
the very low number of patients in subgroup D (total of 57). 
Analyses to characterise the efficacy for each starting dose subgroup by baseline body weight and 
baseline platelet counts were performed post-hoc.  
Independent of dose, patients with HRD not determined status showed very little effect (a median 
prolongation of 2.7 months compared to placebo also in this group, however, HR was 0.85 and the 95% 
CI included 1). 
As of the data cut-off for the primary analysis, OS data were immature with approximately 90% of events 
censored in both the HRDpos and the Overall population. The two other secondary endpoints TFST and 
PFS2 were also immature. No data regarding outcomes for next anticancer therapy following study 
treatment have been submitted. A new condition is imposed in Annex II to provide updated analyses by 
31 December 2025 (Annex II). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
All patients 
The most commonly reported adverse events in the PRIMA study were related to myelosuppression and 
gastrointestinal events, and were more frequently reported for niraparib compared to placebo: 
thrombocytopenia events (66%; grade 3/4: 29%), anaemia events (64%; grade 3/4: 31%), leukopenia  
events (50%; grade 3/4: 22%), nausea (57%), constipation (40%) and vomiting (22%). The majority of 
gastrointestinal adverse events were grade 1 or 2 in severity, but had important impact on tolerability, as 
seen by significantly worse GI-related quality of life scores in the niraparib-treated patients compared to 
placebo.  
Other notable adverse events reported more commonly for niraparib than placebo were fatigue (35%), 
headache (26%), insomnia (25%), decreased appetite (19%), hypertension (17%; grade 3/4: 6%), and 
dyspnoea (18%). 
Dose modifications in the form of dose interruptions and dose reductions were frequently required to 
manage AEs and occurred in 80% and 75% of niraparib-treated patients, respectively (vs 24% and 12% 
in the placebo group, respectively). The main reasons for dose interruptions and reductions with niraparib 
were thrombocytopenia (37% and 31%, respectively), anaemia (31% and 27%, respectively) and 
neutropenia (11% and 8%, respectively).  
The incidence of SAEs in the PRIMA study was 32% in the niraparib arm and 13% in the placebo arm. The 
most common SAEs reported for niraparib were thrombocytopenia (12%), anaemia (6%), platelet count 
decreased (4%), and small intestinal obstruction (2%). None of the patients in the placebo arm reported 
SAEs of thrombocytopenia, anaemia or platelet count decreased.  
Two patients treated with niraparib experienced TEAEs that lead to death, these were intestinal 
perforation and pleural effusion. Neither of these deaths were considered as related to treatment with 
niraparib. 
Supportive updated data from the ongoing NOVA study were submitted with this application. A slightly 
larger proportion of patients in the pooled group of patients who received niraparib in the NOVA and 
Assessment report  
EMA/531223/2020 
Page 161/168 
 
 
  
  
PRIMA studies have died compared to the pool of patients who received placebo (33% vs 28%, 
respectively).  
In the NOVA study, there have been three deaths from TEAEs since the previous DCO date (30 May 
2016), all of whom were assessed by the investigator as related to niraparib. There were two deaths from 
MDS/AML and one of related grade 5 events of sepsis and acute kidney injury. Overall, 158 cases of 
MDS/AML have been observed in the niraparib monotherapy clinical program as of the DCO date 17 May 
2019. The incidence is slightly higher in the niraparib-treated patients compared to placebo-treated 
patients: 15 cases (0.8%) vs 3 cases (0.6%), respectively. 
5/484 (1%) patients on niraparib experienced pneumonitis events in the PRIMA trial and 3/367 (1%) in 
the NOVA trial, compared to 1/423 (0.2%) patients in placebo-treated patients. All events were grade 1 
or 2 in intensity. Half of the events in niraparib-treated patients were considered as possibly or likely 
related to study treatment by the investigator. The evidence for pneumonitis with niraparib was assessed 
in a parallel procedure (EMEA/H/C/004249/II/0020), where pneumonitis was identified as an ADR of 
niraparib. 
Individualised vs fixed dosing 
Dose reductions and dose interruptions were more frequent in the fixed starting dose (FSD) subgroup 
compared to the individualised starting dose (ISD) subgroup (80% and 84% vs 66% and 71%, 
respectively). All of the common TEAEs (incidence rate ≥ 10%) were more frequently reported in the FSD 
subgroup compared to the ISD subgroup. The incidence of anaemia and thrombocytopenia declined the 
most: from 71% and 52% in the FSD subgroup, to 50% and 34% in the ISD subgroup, respectively. More 
patients reported any grade ≥ 3 TEAE in the FSD subgroup (76%) compared to the ISD group (60%). 
The largest decrease was seen in the incidence of grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia and anaemia, which were 
reported in 21% and 23% of patients in the ISD subgroup, respectively, versus 48% and 36% in the FSD 
subgroup. A larger proportion of patients reported any SAE in the FSD subgroup compared to the ISD 
subgroup (35% vs 27%). There was a considerable reduction in SAEs of thrombocytopenia in the ISD 
subgroup, which fell from 17% in the FSD subgroup to 4% in the ISD subgroup. The incidence of platelet 
transfusions was substantially decreased in the niraparib ISD subgroup (6.5%) as well, compared to the 
FSD subgroup (19%). 
Updated safety results including approximately six additional months of safety data (DCO 17 November 
2019) also support an ameliorated safety profile for the 200 mg starting dose in terms of dose 
modifications and incidence of grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia. In patients with low baseline 
weight/platelets, dose interruptions and reductions dropped from 87% and 84% with the 300 mg starting 
dose, respectively, to 68% and 60% respectively, with the 200 mg starting dose. Grade 3/4 
thrombocytopenia was reduced from 52% with the 300 mg starting dose to 17% with 200 mg starting 
dose. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia was reduced from 39% to 7%.  
In the subgroup of patients who received 300 mg ISD (weight ≥ 77 kg and platelets ≥ 150 000/µL), 
about 50% of patients needed a dose reduction in the second month of treatment, compared to about 
28% of patients receiving the 200 mg starting dose. By month 10 of treatment, only about 10% of 
patients in the 300 mg ISD subgroup received a dose of 300 mg, whereas for those patients in the 
200 mg ISD subgroup, about 40% were receiving the dose they were started on (200 mg). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The incidences of MDS/AML across the niraparib monotherapy trials varies by study and is probably 
influenced by different exposures to niraparib and other DNA-damaging agents and varying follow-up 
Assessment report  
EMA/531223/2020 
Page 162/168 
 
 
  
  
times. The follow-up time in the PRIMA study is currently short. MDS/AML is a potential risk in the RMP, 
and two category 3 PASS studies are currently ongoing to follow up this safety concern. 
A higher incidence of thromboembolic events was observed in niraparib-treated patients in the PRIMA and 
NOVA study pool compared to the placebo arm; 11/682 (1.6%) vs 2/423 (0.5%), respectively. Six of the 
niraparib-treated patients and none of the placebo-treated patients experienced events that were of 
grade ≥3. None of the events were assessed as related to treatment with niraparib by the investigators. 
Embolic and thrombotic events are a potential risk with niraparib and will continue to be followed up in 
upcoming PSURs. 
The majority of the patients included in the PRIMA and previous studies with niraparib were Caucasian, 
and exposure in non-Caucasian patients is limited, thus limiting an assessment of safety by race.  
Uncertainties and limitations pertaining to the dosing strategy 
The introduction of the ISD regimen at a later time point in the study resulted in fewer numbers of 
treatment cycles and less overall and actual treatment exposure than those in the fixed starting dose 
(FSD) subgroup patients in the ISD subgroup have a shorter follow-up time compared with patients in the 
FSD subgroup (median 11.1 months vs 16.6 months, respectively, as of the May 2019 DCO). 
The ISD subgroup was relatively small; 169 patients received treatment with niraparib under the ISD 
regimen. Sub-dividing the start dosing subgroups even further to elucidate potential safety benefits of the 
200 mg starting dose, leads to an even smaller population (122 patients received 200 mg ISD and 
34 patients received 300 mg ISD, in addition 13 patients received an incorrect starting dose and were 
therefore excluded from the safety analyses).  
The proposed 300 mg starting dose in patients with body weight ≥77 kg and platelet count ≥150,000/µL 
is based on the observation that this subgroup appears to tolerate the 300 mg starting dose better than 
the remaining patients in terms of Grade 3+ thrombocytopenia risk. However, testing of the proposed 
dosing algorithm after the protocol amendment indicated poor performance in terms of identifying 
patients who will tolerate the 300 mg dose, as a notably high proportion of patients receiving the 300 mg 
starting dose required a dose reduction during the PRIMA study and had high incidences of grade ≥3 
TEAEs. Thus, with the proposed posology, patients with body weight ≥77 kg and platelet count ≥
150,000/µL (~25% of the population) represents a subpopulation with a less beneficial safety profile and 
who could theoretically also benefit from the lower starting dose. A lower starting dose has, however, not 
been tested prospectively in this subgroup.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Overall, in the primary effect analysis in the ITT population, maintenance therapy with niraparib resulted 
in a statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement of the BICR-based PFS for both the 
HRDpos population and the Overall population. These results are encouraging for a patient population 
with currently few treatment options.

As expected, when taking into account the biological rationale, niraparib showed the longest prolongation 
of PFS in patients with HRDpos status (+11.5 months, HR 0.43). Nevertheless, when taking into 
consideration the poorer prognosis of patients with HRDneg status, the increase in median PFS in this 
population, as demonstrated in the subgroup analysis (ITT), is also considered clinically relevant (+2.7 
months, HR 0.68). Similar positive results for the HRDneg patients were observed during the review of 
the initial marketing authorisation for Zejula. However, as discussed further below, updated analyses for 
the applied dose of 200 mg seems to imply lower efficacy for the HRDneg patients as compared to the 
300 mg dose. 
Due to the absence of a bevacizumab maintenance comparator arm, it remains difficult to contextualise 
the overall magnitude of efficacy with niraparib, particularly in HRDneg patients. 
With regards to the group of patients with undetermined HRD status, it still remains unexplained why 
they have a much lesser benefit of niraparib treatment compared to patients determined to be HRDneg. 
This could be due to an (unknown) imbalanced composition of the homologous recombination deficient 
(HRD) status in each treatment group. Although the composition of this group is unknown, some patients 
nonetheless seem to benefit from niraparib treatment, indicating that this is a heterogeneous group. 
Thus, there is no clear reason for excluding patients from niraparib treatment.  
The secondary endpoints were all currently immature; hence, these data were not informative enough to 
exclude a potential detrimental effect in the ITT population or in the subgroups. As resistance 
mechanisms might occur in ovarian cancer patients after exposure to PARP-inhibitors, this could possibly 
affect the efficacy of next line therapy. As the initial efficacy assessment is based on PFS, it requires 
further investigation and a new condition is imposed to the MAH to provide the final OS analysis and 
updated analyses for the secondary endpoints by 31 December 2025 (Annex II). 
Since niraparib is used as maintenance treatment, it is critical to optimise the dose to improve the 
patients’ tolerability to the treatment during their period in remission. The application included several 
presentations of efficacy in various subgroups. The patients with body weight <77 kg or platelet count 
<150,000/µL who received the 200 mg starting dose (subgroup D) were compared to patients receiving 
300 mg prior to the protocol amendment, meeting the same baseline characteristics in terms of body 
weight or platelet count cut-offs (subgroup C). Updated 6 months investigator efficacy analyses for all 3 
patient groups (overall, HRDpos and HRDneg) were provided including comparisons of the FSD group vs. 
the ISD group as well as subgroup C vs. subgroup D.  
For the Overall and HRDpos populations, the effect seemed quite similar in the niraparib arm between the 
FSD and ISD dosing groups (both in terms of point estimates of HR [but to a lesser degree in terms of 
median PFS, especially for the HRDpos] and the KM plots). When comparing the updated KM plots for 
subgroup C (300 mg) against subgroup D (200 mg), the treatment effect seemed to be smaller for the 
niraparib arm in subgroup D (although this was not reflected in the HR point estimates). There are 
several limitations associated with the analyses based on the two subgroups C and D; they were 
performed post-hoc and there were relatively few patients in subgroup D (122 patients in the niraparib 
arm vs. 61 in the placebo arm) compared to subgroup C (243 patients in the niraparib arm vs. 116 in the 
placebo arm). The PRIMA study was not initially designed with the intent of studying different starting 
doses and hence the study did not have the statistical power to allow any firm conclusions to be drawn 
regarding the 200 mg starting dose. Consequently, the results of these analyses are flawed by 
uncertainty. For the Overall and HRDpos populations, it cannot be affirmably stated that there is no loss 
of efficacy with the 200 mg dose compared to the 300 mg dose, however, the potential loss appears to be 
rather modest. 
For the HRDneg population, the updated KM plots for both the FSD group vs. the ISD group and the 
subgroup C vs. subgroup D pointed in the same direction; the 200 mg dose appears to be of lower 
efficacy compared to the 300 mg dose. The HR point estimate, on the other hand, was low, but with wide

confidence intervals. Considering the small data set and the large uncertainties with these analyses, it is 
doubted that the low HR point estimate represents the true treatment effect of the 200 mg dose for the 
HRDneg population. The available data are not sufficiently robust to allow any definite conclusion on 
efficacy of the 200 mg dose compared to the 300 mg dose for this limited patient group. Furthermore, 
there is a biological rationale behind the notion that HRDneg patients would be less sensitive to PARP 
inhibitors compared to HRDpos patients, and thus a different dose-response relationship is expected in 
these patients.   
However, the exploratory analyses showed that in patients treated with a starting dose of 200 mg or 
300 mg per baseline weight or platelet count, niraparib still showed PFS benefit compared to placebo. 
Overall, the totality of evidence based on efficacy data with the modified dosage regimen is considered to 
support a clinically relevant improvement in outcome.  
The data presented indicate that the main benefit of the reduced starting dose is in terms of reductions in 
haematological toxicity, most notably substantial reductions in thrombocytopenia-related events, which is 
also observed by an ameliorated dose modification profile for the 200 mg starting dose. When correcting 
for differences in time-exposure, it appears that other important adverse events, such as GI-events, are 
not markedly reduced. The improvements seen with the lower starting dose are considered to be of 
relevant clinical consequence for those patients who will receive it.  
Neither body weight nor platelet counts have been identified as sources of variability in niraparib 
exposure. Still, it is proposed to dose by these factors. The proposed algorithm is derived from observed 
lower Grade 3+ thrombocytopenia incidences with increasing baseline body weight or increasing platelet 
count. If no loss of treatment effect at 200 mg could be confidently concluded, as claimed by the MAH, 
there would be no clear pharmacological reason not to allow all patients to benefit from the lower starting 
dose. However, with the remaining efficacy uncertainties at 200 mg, it could be argued that the 
thrombocytopenia risk (as predicted by body weight and platelet count) should determine whether the 
benefits of reducing the starting dose outweighs the risk of potential efficacy loss. Whether this shift 
occurs at the exact threshold values of 77 kg and 150,000/µL, respectively, has not been convincingly 
discussed, and the selected threshold values seem arbitrary. Despite its limited pharmacological basis, 
the proposed posology is considered acceptable as it seems to be the preferable option among the 
posology strategies that have been prospectively tested. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The outcomes of the primary analyses in the Overall population are considered clinically relevant in the 
target population, which currently has limited treatment options. The overall safety profile is considered 
acceptable.  
The benefits of an ameliorated safety profile with a 200 mg starting dose vs. a 300 mg starting dose 
outweigh the risk of potentially reduced efficacy in patients with body weight <77 kg or platelet count 
<150,000/uL. Furthermore, relative to placebo, the efficacy data of the modified dosage regimen is 
supportive of a clinically relevant improvement in outcome. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The PRIMA study population consisted of patients with high-grade ovarian cancer. It is therefore 
considered justified that high-grade is reflected in the indication wording. 
As the majority of high-grade ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer are of epithelial origin, 
it was requested that “epithelial” was added to the indication. It was also clarified that niraparib is used in 
“monotherapy” and “advanced” refers to FIGO stages III and IV.

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Zejula as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced 
epithelial (FIGO Stages III and IV) high-grade ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who 
are in response (complete or partial) following completion of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, is 
positive. 
The following measures are considered necessary to address issues related to efficacy:

updated analyses for TFST, PFS-2 and outcomes for next anticancer therapy from 
study PRIMA. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends, by consensus, the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, 
concerning the following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I, II and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of indication to include the use of Zejula as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of 
adult patients with advanced epithelial (FIGO Stages III and IV) high-grade ovarian, fallopian tube or 
primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) following completion of first-line 
platinum-based chemotherapy; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC 
are updated. The MAH is also taking the opportunity to make minor corrections throughout the PI. The 
Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 5.0 of the RMP to add the new indication, bring it in 
line with the RMP template Rev. 2.0.1 and update due dates for category 3 studies has been accepted. 
Annex II is updated with a new post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annexes I, II and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
This recommendation is subject to the following new condition:

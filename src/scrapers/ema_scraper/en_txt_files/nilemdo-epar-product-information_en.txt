CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Nilemdo is indicated in adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and 
non-familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, as an adjunct to diet: 
• 
in combination with a statin or statin with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients unable to 
reach LDL-C goals with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin (see sections 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4) 
or, 
alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant, 
or for whom a statin is contraindicated. 
• 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The recommended dose of Nilemdo is one film-coated tablet of 180 mg taken once daily. 
Concomitant simvastatin therapy 
When Nilemdo is coadministered with simvastatin, simvastatin dose should be limited to 20 mg daily 
(or 40 mg daily for patients with severe hypercholesterolaemia and high risk for cardiovascular 
complications, who have not achieved their treatment goals on lower doses and when the benefits are 
expected to outweigh the potential risks) (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Special populations 
Elderly patients 
No dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients (see section 5.2).

Patients with renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. There are limited 
data available in patients with severe renal impairment (defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate 
[eGFR] < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2), and patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis have not 
been studied. Additional monitoring for adverse reactions may be warranted in these patients when 
Nilemdo is administered (see section 4.4). 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A 
or B). No data are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). Periodic liver 
function tests should be considered for patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Nilemdo in children aged less than 18 years have not yet been established. 
No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Each film-coated tablet should be taken orally with or without food. Tablet should be swallowed 
whole. 
4.3  Contraindications 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Pregnancy (see section 4.6). 
Breast-feeding (see section 4.6). 
Concomitant use with simvastatin > 40 mg daily (see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 4.5). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Potential risk of myopathy with concomitant use of statins 
Bempedoic acid increases plasma concentrations of statins (see section 4.5). Patients receiving 
Nilemdo as adjunctive therapy to a statin should be monitored for adverse reactions that are associated 
with the use of high doses of statins. Statins occasionally cause myopathy. In rare cases, myopathy 
may take the form of rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria, 
and can lead to fatality. All patients receiving Nilemdo in addition to a statin should be advised of the 
potential increased risk of myopathy and told to report promptly any unexplained muscle pain, 
tenderness, or weakness. If such symptoms occur while a patient is receiving treatment with Nilemdo 
and a statin, a lower maximum dose of the same statin or an alternative statin, or discontinuation of 
Nilemdo and initiation of an alternative lipid-lowering therapy should be considered under close 
monitoring of lipid levels and adverse reactions. If myopathy is confirmed by a creatine 
phosphokinase (CPK) level > 10× upper limit of normal (ULN), Nilemdo and any statin that the 
patient is taking concomitantly should be immediately discontinued. 
Myositis with a CPK level > 10× ULN was rarely reported with bempedoic acid and background 
simvastatin 40 mg therapy. Doses of simvastatin > 40 mg should not be used with Nilemdo (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.3). 
Increased serum uric acid 
Bempedoic acid may raise the serum uric acid level due to inhibition of renal tubular OAT2 and may 
cause or exacerbate hyperuricaemia and precipitate gout in patients with a medical history of gout or 
predisposed to gout (see section 4.8). Treatment with Nilemdo should be discontinued if 
hyperuricaemia accompanied with symptoms of gout appear. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elevated liver enzymes 
In clinical trials, elevations of > 3× ULN in the liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) have been reported with bempedoic acid. These elevations have 
been asymptomatic and not associated with elevations ≥ 2× ULN in bilirubin or with cholestasis and 
have returned to baseline with continued treatment or after discontinuation of therapy. Liver function 
tests should be performed at initiation of therapy. Treatment with Nilemdo should be discontinued if 
an increase in transaminases of > 3× ULN persists (see section 4.8). 
Renal impairment 
There is limited experience with bempedoic acid in patients with severe renal impairment (defined as 
eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2), and patients with ESRD on dialysis have not been studied (see section 
5.2). Additional monitoring for adverse reactions may be warranted in these patients when Nilemdo is 
administered. 
Hepatic impairment 
Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) have not been studied (see section 5.2). 
Periodic liver function tests should be considered for patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
Contraception 
Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment. Patients should be 
advised to stop taking Nilemdo before stopping contraceptive measures if they plan to become 
pregnant.  
Excipients 
Nilemdo contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase 
deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 180 mg film-coated tablet (daily dose), 
that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Effects of other medicinal products on bempedoic acid 
Transporter-mediated drug interactions 
In vitro drug interaction studies suggest bempedoic acid, as well as its active metabolite and 
glucuronide form, are not substrates of commonly characterised drug transporters with the exception 
of bempedoic acid glucuronide, which is an OAT3 substrate. 
Probenecid 
Probenecid, an inhibitor of glucuronide conjugation, was studied to evaluate the potential effect of 
these inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of bempedoic acid. Administration of bempedoic acid 
180 mg with steady-state probenecid resulted in a 1.7-fold increase in bempedoic acid area under the 
curve (AUC) and a 1.9-fold increase in bempedoic acid active metabolite (ESP15228) AUC. These 
elevations are not clinically meaningful and do not impact dosing recommendations. 
Effects of bempedoic acid on other medicinal products 
Statins 
The pharmacokinetic interactions between bempedoic acid 180 mg and simvastatin 40 mg, 
atorvastatin 80 mg, pravastatin 80 mg, and rosuvastatin 40 mg were evaluated in clinical trials. 
Administration of a single dose of simvastatin 40 mg with steady-state bempedoic acid 180 mg 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
resulted in a 2-fold increase in simvastatin acid exposure. Elevations of 1.4-fold to 1.5-fold in AUC of 
atorvastatin, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin (administered as single doses) and/or their major metabolites 
were observed when coadministered with bempedoic acid 180 mg. Higher elevations have been 
observed when these statins were coadministered with a supratherapeutic 240 mg dose of bempedoic 
acid (see section 4.4). 
Transporter-mediated drug interactions 
Bempedoic acid and its glucuronide weakly inhibit OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 at clinically relevant 
concentrations. Coadministration of bempedoic acid with medicinal products that are substrates of 
OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 (i.e., bosentan, fimasartan, asunaprevir, glecaprevir, grazoprevir, 
voxilaprevir, and statins such as atorvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, pitavastatin, rosuvastatin, and 
simvastatin [see section 4.4]) may result in increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal 
products. 
Bempedoic acid inhibits OAT2 in vitro, which may be the mechanism responsible for minor 
elevations in serum creatinine and uric acid (see section 4.8). Inhibition of OAT2 by bempedoic acid 
may also potentially increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products that are substrates of 
OAT2. Bempedoic acid may also weakly inhibit OAT3 at clinically relevant concentrations. 
Ezetimibe 
Total ezetimibe (ezetimibe and its glucuronide form) and ezetimibe glucuronide AUC and Cmax 
increased approximately 1.6- and 1.8-fold, respectively, when a single dose of ezetimibe was taken 
with steady-state bempedoic acid. This increase is likely due to inhibition of OATP1B1 by bempedoic 
acid, which results in decreased hepatic uptake and subsequently decreased elimination of 
ezetimibe-glucuronide. Increases in AUC and Cmax for ezetimibe were less than 20%. These elevations 
are not clinically meaningful and do not impact dosing recommendations. 
Other interactions studied 
Bempedoic acid had no effect on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of metformin or the 
pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptive norethindrone/ethinyl estradiol. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Nilemdo is contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3). 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of bempedoic acid in pregnant women. Studies in 
animals with bempedoic acid have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
Because bempedoic acid decreases cholesterol synthesis and possibly the synthesis of other cholesterol 
derivatives needed for normal foetal development, Nilemdo may cause foetal harm when administered 
to pregnant women. Nilemdo should be discontinued prior to conception or as soon as pregnancy is 
recognized (see section 4.3).  
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment (see section 4.4). 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether bempedoic acid/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because of the 
potential for serious adverse reactions, women taking Nilemdo should not breast-feed their infants. 
Nilemdo is contraindicated during breast-feeding (see section 4.3). 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fertility 
No data on the effect of Nilemdo on human fertility are available. Based on animal studies, no effect 
on reproduction or fertility is expected with Nilemdo (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Nilemdo has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety profile of bempedoic acid has been studied in 4 controlled phase 3 clinical studies 
(N=3,621) including patients with hypercholesterolemia on maximum tolerated statin dose (2 studies; 
n=3008) and patients on no or low dose statins (2 studies; n=613). The most commonly reported 
adverse reactions with bempedoic acid during pivotal trials were hyperuricaemia (3.8%), pain in 
extremity (3.1%), and anaemia (2.5%). More patients on bempedoic acid compared to placebo 
discontinued treatment due to muscle spasms (0.7% versus 0.3%), diarrhoea (0.5% versus <0.1%), 
pain in extremity (0.4% versus 0), and nausea (0.3% versus 0.2%), although differences between 
bempedoic acid and placebo were not significant. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Hepatic enzyme elevations 
Increases in serum transaminases (AST and/or ALT) have been reported with bempedoic acid. In 
controlled clinical studies, the incidence of elevations (≥ 3× ULN) in hepatic transaminase levels was 
0.7% for patients treated with bempedoic acid and 0.3% for placebo. These elevations in 
transaminases were not associated with other evidence of liver dysfunction (see section 4.4). 
Increased serum uric acid 
Increases in serum uric acid were observed in clinical trials with bempedoic acid possibly related to 
inhibition of renal tubular OAT2 (see section 4.5). In the pooled placebo-controlled trials, a mean 
increase of 0.8 mg/dL (47.6 micromole/L) in uric acid compared to baseline was observed with 
bempedoic acid at week 12. The elevations in serum uric acid usually occurred within the first 4 weeks 
of treatment and returned to baseline following discontinuation of treatment. Gout was reported in 
1.4% of patients treated with bempedoic acid and 0.4% of patients treated with placebo (see section 
4.4). In both treatment groups, patients who reported gout were more likely to have a medical history 
of gout and/or baseline levels of uric acid above the ULN. 
Effects on serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen 
Bempedoic acid has been shown to increase serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). In the 
pooled placebo-controlled trials, a mean increase of 0.05 mg/dL (4.4 micromole/L) in serum creatinine 
and a mean increase of 1.7 mg/dL (0.61 mmol/L) in BUN compared to baseline was observed with 
bempedoic acid at week 12. The elevations in serum creatinine and BUN usually occurred within the 
first 4 weeks of treatment, remained stable, and returned to baseline following discontinuation of 
treatment. 
The observed elevations in serum creatinine may be associated with bempedoic acid inhibition of 
OAT2-dependent renal tubular secretion of creatinine (see section 4.5), representing a drug-
endogenous substrate interaction and does not appear to indicate worsening renal function. This effect 
should be considered when interpreting changes in estimated creatinine clearance in patients on 
Nilemdo therapy, particularly in patients with medical conditions or receiving medicinal products that 
require monitoring of estimated creatinine clearance. 
Decreased haemoglobin 
Decreases in haemoglobin were observed in clinical trials with bempedoic acid. In the pooled 
placebo-controlled trials, a decrease in haemoglobin from baseline of ≥ 20 g/L and < lower limit of 
normal (LLN) was observed in 4.6% of patients in the bempedoic acid group compared with 1.9% of 
patients on placebo. Greater than 50 g/L and < LLN decreases in haemoglobin were reported at similar 
rates in bempedoic acid and placebo groups (0.2% versus 0.2%, respectively). The decreases in 
haemoglobin usually occurred within the first 4 weeks of treatment and returned to baseline following 
discontinuation of treatment. Among patients who had normal haemoglobin values at baseline, 1.4% 
in the bempedoic acid group and 0.4% in the placebo group experienced haemoglobin values below 
LLN while on treatment. Anaemia was reported in 2.5% of patients treated with bempedoic acid and 
1.6% of patients treated with placebo. 
Elderly population 
Of the 3,621 patients treated with bempedoic acid in the placebo-controlled studies, 2,098 (58%) were 
> 65 years old. No overall difference in safety was observed between elderly and the younger 
population. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Doses up to 240 mg/day (1.3 times the approved recommended dose) have been administered in 
clinical trials with no evidence of dose limiting toxicity. 
No adverse events were observed in animal studies at exposures up to 14-fold higher than those in 
patients treated with bempedoic acid at 180 mg once daily. 
There is no specific treatment for a Nilemdo overdose. In the event of an overdose, the patient should 
be treated symptomatically, and supportive measures instituted as required.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Lipid modifying agents, other lipid modifying agents, ATC code: 
C10AX15 
Mechanism of action 
Bempedoic acid is an adenosine triphosphate citrate lyase (ACL) inhibitor that lowers low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in the liver. ACL is an enzyme 
upstream of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase in the cholesterol 
biosynthesis pathway. Bempedoic acid requires coenzyme A (CoA) activation by very long-chain 
acyl-CoA synthetase 1 (ACSVL1) to ETC-1002-CoA. ACSVL1 is expressed primarily in the liver and 
not in skeletal muscle. Inhibition of ACL by ETC-1002-CoA results in decreased cholesterol synthesis 
in the liver and lowers LDL-C in blood via upregulation of low-density lipoprotein receptors. 
Additionally, inhibition of ACL by ETC-1002-CoA results in concomitant suppression of hepatic fatty 
acid biosynthesis. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Administration of bempedoic acid alone and in combination with other lipid modifying medicinal 
products decreases LDL-C, non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), apolipoprotein B 
(apo B), and total cholesterol (TC) in patients with hypercholesterolaemia or mixed dyslipidaemia. 
Because patients with diabetes are at elevated risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the 
clinical trials of bempedoic acid included patients with diabetes mellitus. Among the subset of patients 
with diabetes, lower levels of HbA1c were observed as compared to placebo (on average 0.2%). In 
patients without diabetes, no difference in HbA1c was observed between bempedoic acid and placebo 
and there were no differences in the rates of hypoglycaemia. 
Cardiac electrophysiology 
At a dose of 240 mg (1.3 times the approved recommended dose), bempedoic acid does not prolong 
the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent.

Clinical efficacy and safety 
The effect of Nilemdo on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not yet been determined. 
The efficacy of Nilemdo was investigated in four multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled trials involving 3,623 adult patients with hypercholesterolaemia or mixed 
dyslipidaemia, with 2,425 patients randomised to bempedoic acid. All patients received bempedoic 
acid 180 mg or placebo orally once daily. In two trials, patients were taking background lipid-
modifying therapies consisting of a maximum tolerated dose of statin, with or without other lipid-
modifying therapies. Two trials were conducted in patients with documented statin intolerance. The 
primary efficacy endpoint in all Phase 3 trials was the mean percent reduction from baseline in LDL-C 
at week 12 as compared with placebo.  
Combination therapy with statins 
Study 1002-047 was a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 52-week trial in 
patients with hypercholesterolaemia or mixed dyslipidaemia. Efficacy of Nilemdo was evaluated at 
week 12. The trial included 779 patients randomised 2:1 to receive either bempedoic acid (n=522) or 
placebo (n=257) as add-on to a maximum tolerated lipid lowering therapy. Maximum tolerated lipid 
lowering therapy was defined as a maximum tolerated statin dose (including statin regimens other than 
daily dosing and no to very low doses) alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies. 
Patients on simvastatin 40 mg/day or higher were excluded from the trial. 
Overall, the mean age at baseline was 64 years (range: 28 to 91 years), 51% were ≥ 65 years old, 
36% women, 94% White, 5% were Black, and 1% Asian. The mean baseline LDL-C was 120.4 mg/dL 
(3.1 mmol/L). At the time of randomisation, 91% of patients were receiving statin therapy and 53% 
were receiving high-intensity statin therapy. Bempedoic acid significantly reduced LDL-C from 
baseline to week 12 compared with placebo (p < 0.001). Bempedoic acid also significantly reduced 
non-HDL-C, apo B, and TC. 
Study 1002-040 was a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled 52-week trial 
evaluating safety and efficacy of bempedoic acid in patients with hypercholesterolaemia or mixed 
dyslipidaemia. Efficacy of Nilemdo was evaluated at week 12. The trial included 2,230 patients 
randomised 2:1 to receive either bempedoic acid (n=1,488) or placebo (n=742) as add-on to a 
maximum tolerated lipid lowering therapy. Maximum tolerated lipid lowering therapy was defined as 
a maximum tolerated statin dose (including statin regimens other than daily dosing and very low 
doses) alone or in combination with other lipid lowering therapies. Patients on simvastatin 40 mg per 
day or higher and patients on PCSK9 inhibitors were excluded from the trial. 
Overall, the mean age at baseline was 66 years (range: 24 to 88 years), 61% were ≥ 65 years old, 
27% women, 96% White, 3% were Black, and 1% Asian. The mean baseline LDL-C was 103.2 mg/dL 
(2.7 mmol/L). At the time of randomisation, all patients were receiving statin therapy and 50% were 
receiving high-intensity statin therapy. Bempedoic acid significantly reduced LDL-C from baseline to 
week 12 compared with placebo (p < 0.001). A significantly higher proportion of patients achieved an 
LDL-C of ˂ 70 mg/dL (˂ 1.81 mmol/L) in the bempedoic acid group as compared with placebo at 
week 12 (32% versus 9%, p < 0.001), bempedoic acid also significantly reduced non-HDL-C, apo B, 
and TC (see table 2).

Statin intolerant patients 
Study 1002-048 was a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week trial 
evaluating the efficacy of Nilemdo versus placebo in lowering LDL-C when added to ezetimibe in 
patients with elevated LDL-C who had a history of statin intolerance and were unable to tolerate more 
than the lowest approved starting dose of a statin. The trial included 269 patients randomised 2:1 to 
receive either bempedoic acid (n=181) or placebo (n=88) as add-on to ezetimibe 10 mg daily for 
12 weeks. 
Overall, the mean age at baseline was 64 years (range: 30 to 86 years), 55% were ≥ 65 years old, 
61% were women, 89% White, 8% were Black, 2% Asian, and 1% other. The mean baseline LDL-C 
was 127.6 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L). At the time of randomisation, 33% of patients on bempedoic acid 
versus 28% on placebo were receiving statin therapy at less than or equal to lowest approved doses. 
Bempedoic acid significantly reduced LDL-C from baseline to week 12 compared with placebo 
(p < 0.001). Bempedoic acid also significantly reduced non-HDL-C, apo B, and TC (see table 3). 
Study 1002-046 was a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled 24-week trial 
evaluating the efficacy of Nilemdo versus placebo in patients with elevated LDL-C who were 
statin-intolerant or unable to tolerate two or more statins, one at the lowest dose. Patients able to 
tolerate a dose that was less than the approved starting dose of a statin were allowed to stay on that 
dose during the study. Efficacy of bempedoic acid was evaluated at week 12. The trial included 345 
patients randomised 2:1 to receive either bempedoic acid (n=234) or placebo (n=111) for 24 weeks. At 
the time of randomisation, 8% of patients on bempedoic acid versus 10% on placebo were receiving 
statin therapy at less than the lowest approved doses and 36% of patients on bempedoic acid versus 
30% of patients on placebo were on other nonstatin lipid-modifying therapies.  
Overall, the mean age at baseline was 65 years (range: 26 to 88 years), 58% were ≥ 65 years old, 
56% were women, 89% White, 8% were Black, 2% Asian, and 1% other. The mean baseline LDL-C 
was 157.6 mg/dL (4.1 mmol/L). 
Bempedoic acid significantly reduced LDL-C from baseline to week 12 compared with placebo 
(p < 0.001). Bempedoic acid also significantly reduced non-HDL-C, apo B, and TC (see table 3).

Treatment in the absence of lipid-modifying therapies 
In Study 1002-046, 133 patients in the bempedoic acid group and 67 patients in the placebo group 
were on no background lipid-modifying therapies. Bempedoic acid significantly reduced LDL-C from 
baseline to week 12 compared with placebo in this subgroup. The difference between bempedoic acid 
and placebo in mean percent change in LDL-C from baseline to week 12 was -22.1% 
(CI: -26.8%, -17.4%; p < 0.001).

a.  Percent change from baseline was analysed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with treatment and randomisation 
strata as factors and baseline lipid parameter as a covariate. 
In all four trials, the maximum LDL-C lowering effects were observed as early as week 4 and efficacy 
was maintained throughout the trials. These results were consistent across all subgroups studied in any 
of the trials, including age, gender, race, ethnicity, region, history of diabetes, baseline LDL-C, body 
mass index (BMI), HeFH status, and background therapies. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
bempedoic acid in paediatric population from 4 to less than 18 years of age in the treatment of 
elevated cholesterol. See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use.  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Pharmacokinetic data indicate that bempedoic acid is absorbed with a median time to maximum 
concentration of 3.5 hours when administered as Nilemdo 180 mg tablets. Bempedoic acid 
pharmacokinetic parameters are presented as the mean [standard deviation (SD)] unless otherwise 
specified. Bempedoic acid can be considered a prodrug that is activated intracellularly by ACSVL1 to 
ETC-1002-CoA. The steady-state Cmax and AUC following multiple dose administration in patients 
with hypercholesterolaemia were 24.8 (6.9) microgram/mL and 348 (120) microgram∙h/mL, 
respectively. Bempedoic acid steady-state pharmacokinetics were generally linear over a range of 
120 mg to 220 mg. There were no time-dependent changes in bempedoic acid pharmacokinetics 
following repeat administration at the recommended dose, and bempedoic acid steady-state was 
achieved after 7 days. The mean accumulation ratio of bempedoic acid was approximately 2.3-fold. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Concomitant food administration had no effect on the oral bioavailability of bempedoic acid when 
administered as Nilemdo 180 mg tablets. Food slows the absorption rate of bempedoic acid; the 
absorption rate constant with food is 0.32/h. 
Distribution 
The bempedoic acid apparent volume of distribution (V/F) was 18 L. Plasma protein binding of 
bempedoic acid, its glucuronide and its active metabolite, ESP15228, were 99.3%, 98.8% and 99.2%, 
respectively. Bempedoic acid does not partition into red blood cells. 
Biotransformation 
In vitro metabolic interaction studies suggest that bempedoic acid, as well as its active metabolite and 
glucuronide forms are not metabolised by and do not inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzymes. 
The primary route of elimination for bempedoic acid is through metabolism to the acyl glucuronide. 
Bempedoic acid is also reversibly converted to an active metabolite (ESP15228) based on aldo-keto 
reductase activity observed in vitro from human liver. Mean plasma AUC metabolite/parent drug ratio 
for ESP15228 following repeat-dose administration was 18% and remained constant over time. Both 
compounds are converted to inactive glucuronide conjugates in vitro by UGT2B7. Bempedoic acid, 
ESP15228 and their respective conjugated forms were detected in plasma with bempedoic acid 
accounting for the majority (46%) of the AUC0-48h and its glucuronide being the next most prevalent 
(30%). ESP15228 and its glucuronide represented 10% and 11% of the plasma AUC0-48h, respectively. 
The steady-state Cmax and AUC of the equipotent active metabolite (ESP15228) of bempedoic acid in 
patients with hypercholesterolaemia were 3.0 (1.4) microgram/mL and 54.1 (26.4) microgram∙h/mL, 
respectively. ESP15228 likely made a minor contribution to the overall clinical activity of bempedoic 
acid based on systemic exposure and pharmacokinetic properties. 
Elimination 
The steady-state clearance (CL/F) of bempedoic acid determined from a population PK analysis in 
patients with hypercholesterolaemia was 12.1 mL/min after once-daily dosing; renal clearance of 
unchanged bempedoic acid represented less than 2% of total clearance. The mean (SD) half-life for 
bempedoic acid in humans was 19 (10) hours at steady-state. 
Following single oral administration of 240 mg of bempedoic acid (1.3 times the approved 
recommended dose), 62.1% of the total dose (bempedoic acid and its metabolites) was recovered in 
urine, primarily as the acyl glucuronide conjugate of bempedoic acid, and 25.4% was recovered in 
faeces. Less than 5% of the administered dose was excreted as unchanged bempedoic acid in faeces 
and urine combined. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
Pharmacokinetics of bempedoic acid was evaluated in a population PK analysis performed on pooled 
data from all clinical trials (n=2,261) to assess renal function on the steady-state AUC of bempedoic 
acid and in a single-dose pharmacokinetic study in subjects with varying degrees of renal function. 
Compared to patients with normal renal function, the mean bempedoic acid exposures were higher in 
patients with mild or moderate renal impairment by 1.4-fold (90% PI: 1.3, 1.4) and 1.9-fold 
(90% PI: 1.7, 2.0), respectively (see section 4.4).  
There is limited information in patients with severe renal impairment; in a single dose study, the 
bempedoic acid AUC was increased by 2.4-fold in patients (n=5) with severe renal impairment 
(eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) compared to those with normal renal function. Clinical studies of 
bempedoic acid did not include patients with ESRD on dialysis (see section 4.4). 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of bempedoic acid and its metabolite (ESP15228) was studied in patients with 
normal hepatic function or mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A or B) following a 
single dose (n=8/group). Compared to patients with normal hepatic function, the bempedoic acid mean 
Cmax and AUC were decreased by 11% and 22%, respectively, in patients with mild hepatic 
impairment and by 14% and 16%, respectively, in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. This is 
not expected to result in lower efficacy. Therefore, no dose adjustment is necessary in patients with 
mild or moderate hepatic impairment. 
Bempedoic acid was not studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). 
Other special populations 
The pharmacokinetics of bempedoic acid were not affected by age, gender, or race. Body weight was a 
statistically significant covariate. The lowest quartile of body weight (< 73 kg) was associated with an 
approximate 30% greater exposure. The increase in exposure was not clinically significant and no 
dose adjustments are recommended based on weight. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
The standard battery of genotoxicity studies has not identified any mutagenic or clastogenic potential 
of bempedoic acid. In full lifetime carcinogenicity studies in rodents, bempedoic acid increased the 
incidence of hepatocellular and thyroid gland follicular tumours in male rats and hepatocellular 
tumours in male mice. Because these are common tumours observed in rodent lifetime bioassays and 
the mechanism for tumourigenesis is secondary to a rodent-specific PPAR alpha activation, these 
tumours are not considered to translate to human risk. 
Increased liver weight and hepatocellular hypertrophy were observed in rats only and were partially 
reversed after the 1-month recovery at ≥ 30 mg/kg/day or 4 times the exposure in humans at 180 mg. 
Reversible, non-adverse changes in laboratory parameters indicative of these hepatic effects, decreases 
in red blood cell and coagulation parameters, and increases in urea nitrogen and creatinine were 
observed in both species at tolerated doses. The NOAEL for adverse response in the chronic studies 
was 10 mg/kg/day and 60 mg/kg/day associated with exposures below and 15 times the human 
exposure at 180 mg in rats and monkeys, respectively. 
Bempedoic acid was not teratogenic or toxic to embryos or foetuses in pregnant rabbits at doses up to 
80 mg/kg/day or 12 times the systemic exposure in humans at 180 mg. Pregnant rats given bempedoic 
acid at 10, 30, and 60 mg/kg/day during organogenesis had decreased numbers of viable foetuses and 
reduced foetal body weight at ≥ 30 mg/kg/day or 4 times the systemic exposure in humans at 180 mg. 
An increased incidence of foetal skeletal findings (bent scapula and ribs) were observed at all doses, at 
exposures below the systemic exposure in humans at 180 mg. In a pre- and post-natal development 
study, pregnant rats administered bempedoic acid at 5, 10, 20 and 30 mg/kg/day throughout pregnancy 
and lactation had adverse maternal effects at ≥ 20 mg/kg/day and reductions in numbers of live pups 
and pup survival, pup growth and learning and memory at ≥ 10 mg/kg/day, with maternal exposures at 
10 mg/kg/day, less than the exposure in humans at 180 mg. 
No data are available on the effect of Nilemdo on human fertility. Administration of bempedoic acid 
to male and female rats prior to mating and through gestation day 7 in females resulted in changes in 
estrous cyclicity, decreased numbers of corpora lutea and implants at ≥ 30 mg/kg/day with no effects 
on male or female fertility or sperm parameters at 60 mg/kg/day (4 and 9 times the systemic exposure 
in humans at 180 mg, respectively).

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Nilemdo is and what it is used for 
What Nilemdo is and how it works 
Nilemdo is a medicine that lowers levels of ‘bad’ cholesterol (also called “LDL-cholesterol”), a type 
of fat, in the blood. 
Nilemdo contains the active substance bempedoic acid, which is inactive until it enters the liver where 
it is changed to its active form. Bempedoic acid decreases the production of cholesterol in the liver and 
increases the removal of LDL-cholesterol from the blood by blocking an enzyme (ATP citrate lyase) 
needed for the production of cholesterol. 
What Nilemdo is used for 
Nilemdo is given to adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia or mixed dyslipidaemia, which are 
conditions that cause a high cholesterol level in the blood. It is given in addition to a cholesterol-
lowering diet. 
Nilemdo is given: 
• 
if you have been using a statin (such as simvastatin, a commonly used medicine that treats high 
cholesterol) and this does not lower your LDL-cholesterol sufficiently; 
alone or together with other cholesterol-lowering medicines when statins are not tolerated or 
cannot be used. 
• 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you take Nilemdo 
Do not take Nilemdo: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
if you are allergic to bempedoic acid or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6); 
if you are pregnant; 
if you are breast-feeding; 
if you take more than 40 mg of simvastatin daily (another medicine used to lower cholesterol). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Nilemdo: 
• 
• 
• 
if you ever had gout; 
if you have severe kidney problems; 
if you have severe liver problems. 
Your doctor may do a blood test before you start taking Nilemdo. This is to check how well your liver 
is working. 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give Nilemdo to children and adolescents under 18 years of age. The use of Nilemdo has not 
been studied in this age group. 
Other medicines and Nilemdo 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. In particular, tell your doctor if you are taking medicine(s) with any of the following active 
substances: 
• 
atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin (used to lower 
cholesterol and known as statins). 
The risk of muscle disease may increase when taking both a statin and Nilemdo. Tell your 
doctor immediately about any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness. 
•  bosentan (used to manage a condition called pulmonary artery hypertension). 
• 
• 
fimasartan (used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure). 
asunaprevir, glecaprevir, grazoprevir, voxilaprevir (used to treat hepatitis C). 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not take this medicine if you are pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or think you may be pregnant, as 
there is a possibility that it could harm an unborn baby. If you get pregnant while taking this medicine, 
call your doctor immediately and stop taking Nilemdo. 
• 
• 
Pregnancy 
Before starting treatment, you should confirm you are not pregnant and are using effective 
contraception, as advised by your doctor. If you use contraceptive pills and suffer from an 
episode of diarrhoea or vomiting that lasts more than 2 days, you must use an alternative method 
of contraception (e.g. condoms, diaphragm) for 7 days following resolution of symptoms. 
If, after you have started treatment with Nilemdo, you decide that you would like to become 
pregnant, tell your doctor, as your treatment will need to be changed. 
Breast-feeding 
Do not take Nilemdo if you are breast-feeding because it is not known if Nilemdo passes into 
milk. 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Driving and using machines 
Nilemdo has no or little influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Nilemdo contains lactose and sodium 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine. 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
3. 
How to take Nilemdo 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
The recommended dose is one tablet once daily. 
Swallow the tablet whole with food or between meals. 
If you take more Nilemdo than you should 
Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately. 
If you forget to take Nilemdo 
If you notice that you forgot: 
• 
a dose late in a day, take the missed dose and take the next dose at your regular time the next 
day. 
the previous day’s dose, take your tablet at the regular time and do not make up for the forgotten 
dose. 
• 
If you stop taking Nilemdo 
Do not stop taking Nilemdo without your doctor’s permission as your cholesterol may rise again. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

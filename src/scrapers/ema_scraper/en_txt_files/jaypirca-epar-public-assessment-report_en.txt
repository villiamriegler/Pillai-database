2.  Scientific discussion  
2.1.  Problem statement  
2.1.1.  Disease or condition  
The proposed indication for pirtobrutinib is: monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with mantle 
cell lymphoma (MCL) who have been previously treated with a Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
MCL is a rare and aggressive subtype of B-cell NHL and is incurable with current therapies. MCL 
accounts for 3% to 10% of all new NHL cases per year with a typical incidence of approximately 1 to 2 
per 100,000 in Europe and the US (Dreyling et al. 2017; Jain and Wang 2019). Prognosis for patients 
with MCL is poor, with OS of 3 to 5 years at diagnosis (Dreylinget al. 2018). MCL is more common in 
men (3:1; male:female) and patients are typically aged 60 to 70 years old at diagnosis.  
2.1.3.  Biologic features  
The majority of MCL cases have an immunophenotype which is positive for B cell antigens (CD5, BCL-
2, and cyclinD1), and negative for CD23 and follicular centre cell-associated antigens, such as CD10 
and BCL-6.  
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis  
Patients diagnosed with MCL can be categorised as low risk, intermediate risk, or high risk using the 
MCL International Prognostic Index (MIPI), which incorporates clinical features (Hoster et al. 2008) 
with tumour cell proliferation and blastoid histology as additional prognostic factors. Generally, MIPI 
classification of intermediate or high risk is associated with poor prognosis.  
While the indolent presentation of MCL is reported in a minority of patients with smoldering or 
leukaemic histology, the typical clinical presentation of MCL is aggressive and includes classic, blastoid, 
or pleomorphic histology with treatment at diagnosis required for most patients. 
2.1.5.  Management  
Frontline treatment selection is based on patient characteristics and candidacy for intensive 
chemoimmunotherapy approaches, which yield high response rates including CRs but few long-term 
remissions (Lenz et al. 2005; Flinn et al. 2014). Young and fit patients typically receive intensive 
chemoimmunotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation in the first-line setting (NCCN 2021b; 
Flinn et al. 2014; Lenz et al. 2005). Cure with this approach is rare and relapse is nearly universal.  
Treatment benefits become progressively shorter with each subsequent line of therapy after relapse 
(Kumar et al. 2019). Prior to the development of BTK inhibitors, salvage therapies such as bortezomib, 
lenalidomide, or temsirolimus were approved, yielding ORRs consistently less than 40%, CRs generally 
less than 10%, and median PFS consistently less than 9 months (Goy et al. 2009; Trněný et al. 2016; 
Hess et al. 2009). Covalent BTK inhibitors (for example, ibrutinib) are the most established therapy for 
relapsed MCL based on efficacy data that are clearly superior to other approved salvage therapies with 
EMA/308908/2023  
Page 9/122 
 
 
  
 
 
ORRs of 70% to 84% and a median PFS of 12 to 22 months (Rule et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2019; Song 
et al. 2020). 
While there are clear benefits in treating patients with MCL with covalent BTK inhibitors, BTK inhibition 
is not curative and when patients relapse, outlook is poor and subsequent treatment options are not 
well defined (NCCN 2021b). Prospective studies evaluating therapy options in the post-BTK inhibitor 
setting of relapsed MCL are rare or not yet reported. Available data demonstrate that following 
progression on BTK inhibitors, survival of patients with MCL is very poor with median OS at only 2.5 to 
8.4 months (Martin et al. 2016; Cheah et al. 2015; Epperla et al. 2017). Published data with 
bortezomib, lenalidomide, and temsirolimus predate use of BT inhibitors, but response rates to 
chemoimmunotherapy given as post-ibrutinib salvage therapy are as low as 27% (Martin et al. 2016; 
Jain et al. 2018). 
As per current guidelines, the only authorised drug after BTKi is brexucabtagene autoleucel. This 
CD19-targeted CAR-T treatment option is limited by the known production difficulties inherent to CAR-
T cells. 
The management of patients with relapsed/refractory MCL post BTKi represents a clinical challenge. 
Patients typically receive salvage use of treatment for r/r MCL prior to the arrival of BTKi or use/re-use 
of previous lines therapies (e.g. rituximab-bendamustine-cytarabine regimen (R-BAC)).  
2.2.  About the product  
Type of application and aspects on development 
The CHMP did not agree to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
not considered to be of major public health interest as it was not clear from available data at that time 
whether pirtobrutinib could fulfil the unmet medical need in the claimed indication. 
The applicant requested consideration of its application for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation in 
accordance with Article 14-a of the above-mentioned Regulation, based on the following criteria: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data. 
To confirm the positive benefit-risk profile the applicant has initiated a confirmatory Phase 3 Study 
in previously treated, but BTK inhibitor-naive, patients with MCL (Study 20019 [BRUIN-MCL-
321]): a global, open-label, Phase 3 randomised study in previously treated, but BTK inhibitor-
naive, patients with MCL, randomised 1:1 between pirtobrutinib experimental arm and the 
Investigator’s choice of covalent BTK inhibitor.  
The primary endpoint of the study is PFS as assessed by the IRC per the Lugano 2014 criteria 
(Cheson et al. 2014). PFS, as the primary endpoint for this study, serves as a surrogate for OS 
and is used because of the protracted duration of follow-up expected to reach an OS endpoint. 
Overall survival is a secondary endpoint for the study. At the time of the primary PFS analysis, the 
secondary OS analysis will seek to establish that there is no detrimental impact on survival, with a 
potential to observe a positive trend in OS.  
• 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed, as in this this post-BTK inhibitor setting there are no 
prospective data available on alternative commonly used pharmacologic approaches such as 
temsirolimus, bortezomib or lenalidomide.   
EMA/308908/2023  
Page 10/122 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required. Given the epidemiology of the condition, a substantial 
number of patients may potentially benefit from treatment with pirtobrutinib over the period 
between Conditional Marketing Authorisation and full approval. 
2.3.  Quality aspects  
2.3.1.  Introduction  
The finished product is presented as an immediate release film-coated tablet containing either 50 mg 
or 100 mg of pirtobrutinib. 
Other ingredients are, for the tablet core: hypromellose acetate succinate, microcrystalline cellulose, 
lactose monohydrate, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate, colloidal hydrated silica, and for 
the film-coating: hypromellose, titanium dioxide, triacetin and indigo carmine (E132).  
The product is available in polyvinylchloride/polychlorotrifluoroethylene blisters sealed with an 
aluminium foil.  
2.3.2.  Active substance  
General information 
The chemical name of pirtobrutinib is 5-amino-3-{4-[(5-fluoro-2-methoxybenzamido)methyl]phenyl}-
1-[(2S)-1,1,1-trifluoropropan-2-yl]-1H-pyrazole-4-carboxamide corresponding to the molecular 
formula C22H21F4N5O3. It has a relative molecular mass of 479.44 and the structure depicted in Figure 
1.  
Figure 1: Active substance structure  
The chemical structure of pirtobrutinib was elucidated by a combination of mass spectroscopy, FTIR 
analysis, NMR analysis, ultraviolet absorption, single crystal X-Ray analysis and elemental analysis.  
The  active  substance  is  a  white  to  practically  white  to  light  brown  solid.  The  active  substance  not 
hygroscopic and it is practically insoluble over a pH range of 1.1 to 6.8.  
Pirtobrutinib exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of one chiral centre having “S” 
configuration. The optical rotation analysis of pirtobrutinib is provided and is consistent with the 
presence of the chiral centre in the structure. Proof of structure and stereochemistry of pirtobrutinib 
was achieved by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. No significant change in the level of R-
enantiomer has been observed on storage of pirtobrutinib active substance. In addition, solid samples 
of the active substance were stressed under conditions of heat, humidity, and light and were analysed 
by chiral HPLC.  
EMA/308908/2023  
Page 11/122 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Polymorphism has been observed for pirtobrutinib. The manufacturing process consistently delivers the 
desired form and the stability of active substance over storage have been shown. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Pirtobrutinib active substance is manufactured using a convergent synthesis with sufficient synthetic 
steps from each selected starting material and several isolation and crystallisation steps. It starts from 
well-defined starting materials with acceptable specifications.  
No reprocessing is applied and there is no use of recovered solvent. No aseptic or sterilisation process 
is performed in the manufacture of pirtobrutinib.   
The manufacturing process has been developed using a combination of conventional univariate studies 
and elements of QbD such as risk assessment and multivariate bracketing studies. Based on these 
studies, proven acceptable ranges (PARs) have been defined for several steps of the manufacturing 
process of the active substance and for several material inputs. The available development data, the 
proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from commercial scale batches fully support the 
proposed PARs. The proposed PARs are not intended to claim a design space and it has been confirmed 
that any movement within a PAR range will occur only when other parameters are held at their target 
values. Overall, there is a good correlation between the ranges explored through these experiments 
and the PARs. claimed in section 3.2.S.2.2.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. The acceptance 
criteria have been justified by purge studies at appropriate levels.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances.  
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised.  
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the 
clinical development program. Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and have 
been justified.  Process development changes have consisted of changes to solvents, reagents and 
processing conditions. 
The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is considered to be 
comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process.  
The active substance is packaged in a linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) primary liner which 
contains an antistatic additive. The LLDPE liner is placed in a laminated foil liner, individually cable tied 
or sealed. The liners may then be placed in an appropriate container such as a fibre drum, corrugated 
container, polyethylene drum, or metal drum for shipping and handling. The LLDPE primary liner 
complies with the Ph. Eur. and the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for identification (IR - Ph. Eur. 2.2.24), assay (HPLC), 
purity (HPLC), enantiomer content (HPLC), specified impurities (HPLC and GC), residual solvents (GC), 
description (visual), water content (Ph. Eur. 2.5.32) and residue on ignition (Ph. Eur. 2.4.14). The 
active substance specifications are based on the active substance critical quality attributes (CQA). 
The active substance specifications are considered in line with guidance and acceptable. Exclusion of 
tests such as chiral identity, elemental impurities, microbial testing, particle size, and crystal form has 
EMA/308908/2023  
Page 12/122 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
been appropriately justified.  Limits for assay, has been tightened during the procedure, following a 
request from the CHMP. 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data for active substance process variants used in toxicology studies, clinical studies, 
stability studies, and establishment of the primary reference standard are provided. Batch analysis 
data from three commercial scale batches (validation batches) of the active substance are provided. 
The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of active substance by a process representative of 
the commercial process, stored in a container closure system representative of that intended for the 
market for up to 12 months under long term conditions (30ºC / 65% RH) and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The 
parameters assessed during primary stability studies are description, identity, assay, impurities, R-
enantiomer and water. Analytical methods used for stability studies are the same as those used for 
release testing of the active substance. All parameters tested have remained within the limits of 
specification requirements for all samples. No significant trend in results at any time point or storage 
condition is observed. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on solid samples of the active 
substance, the results confirm that the active substance in the solid state is photostable.  
Samples of the active substance in the solid form and in solution were also placed under various stress 
conditions of heat and humidity for the solid state and of heat, light, oxidation, and over a wide pH 
range for the solutions.  No degradation was observed for the solid state under the investigated stress 
conditions, while the solution state stress testing indicated that pirtobrutinib in solution is susceptible 
to oxidative degradation and photodegradation.   
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months, without any 
storage conditions, when stored in the proposed container.

All the excipients are of compendial quality (Ph. Eur., JP, USP-NF). There are no novel excipients used 
in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in 
paragraph 2.3.1.  of this report. Statement from the manufacturer of lactose monohydrate, sole 
excipient from animal origin, that confirms compliance with applicable BSE/TSE requirements is 
provided and it is satisfactory. 
Pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements. 
The critical quality attributes (CQAs) identified were description, identification, potency, purity, 
content, uniformity and release.    
The pharmaceutical development focused on addressing the low aqueous solubility of the active 
substance across the physiological pH range. An amorphous solid dispersion in a polymer matrix, 
produced by spray drying was chosen to improve the solubility and achieve the desired exposure for 
the clinical doses. This spray dried dispersion (SDD) is an intermediate product. The formulation 
development was based on the selection of excipients with appropriate attributes in combination with 
the relevant active substance and SDD properties to achieve the identified CQAs, as well as 
demonstration of product robustness across a range of process parameters that have potential impact 
to finished product performance. The choice of the SDD, of the polymer hypromellose acetate 
succinate, and of the ratio API:polymer has been justified. The other excipients are classical and within 
typical ranges for this kind of formulation. Characterisation of the optimised formulation has been 
conducted. the production of stable amorphous dispersion across a range of conditions has been 
supported.  
The history of development of the SDD and of the tablet formulations up to final commercial 
formulation has been explained. Characterisation of the optimised formulation has been conducted to 
support the production of stable amorphous dispersion across a range of conditions. Suitability of the 
commercial formulation has been demonstrated.  
The manufacturing development of the SDD and the tablet has been evaluated through the use of risk 
assessment, univariate and multivariate experiments and design of experiments to identify the critical 
product quality attributes and critical process parameters. A design space for the SDD and the tablet 
manufacturing was established. For SDD, based on the knowledge gained, process conditions for the 
spray-drying and the secondary drying steps have been optimised to remain below the SDD glass 
transition temperature and to maintain impurity profile within acceptable limits. A summary of SDD 
commercial process ranges is provided based on the results gathered from development experience at 
the commercial scale, historical data at the manufacturing site, and model-based assessments. SDD 
specifications were developed as part of an integrated approach to a quality attribute-based control 
strategy.  
The tablet manufacturing process consists of typical finished product operations, film-coating and 
packaging. Each step of the tablet manufacturing process has been optimised on small and commercial 
scale equipment. Appropriate responses for the tablet manufacturing process were evaluated. As full 
testing of the finished product is routinely performed at release, design space is not the sole element 
of the control strategy contributing to the quality of finished product. 
Sufficiently significant ranges of process parameters have been explored during development. 
Appropriate justification of parameters and ranges has been provided. When investigating downstream 
process steps, variability of the incoming materials from upstream step was taken into account. This 
allowed the multivariate assessment of the overall process. Outputs raw data have been provided, 
which allowed assessment to the specifications. The dissolution method was developed to be 
discriminating for properties that could impact in vivo performance. The discriminatory power of the 
dissolution method has been demonstrated. The proposed specification for dissolution has been 
EMA/308908/2023  
Page 14/122 
 
 
  
 
 
justified by dissolution data gathered during development of the commercial formulation and 
manufacturing process. The dissolution profiles of batches used in the pivotal study have also been 
provided. 
The formulation used during clinical studies is the same as that intended for marketing.  
The primary packaging is polyvinylchloride/polychlorotrifluoroethylene blisters sealed with an 
aluminium foil. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and/or EC requirements. The choice of the container 
closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the 
product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of two main steps: preparation of the SDD and preparation of the 
tablets.  
The available development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from commercial 
scale batches fully support the proposed design spaces. IPC for  SDD and for the finished product are 
satisfactory.  
The process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process. 
A traditional process validation has been performed at target conditions on three consecutive full-scale 
SDD batches and tablet batches per strength. The summary report has been presented.  It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner.  
Release specifications for the intermediate SDD have been established. Respective analytical 
procedures and their validation are provided. 
Several hold times are specified. The hold time for bulk coated tablets is included in the calculation of 
the shelf-life. 
Bulk packaging is described for SDD and film-coated tablets. 
Risk assessment for the pirtobrutinib bulk tablet shipping was conducted and concluded to a low risk.  
Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form: identity (HPLC), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), description (visual), uniformity of 
dosage unit (HPLC, Ph. Eur.), dissolution (HPLC, Ph. Eur.), dye identity for titanium and indigo carmine 
(colourimetric). 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specification through 
traditional final product release testing. The tests and controls applied for the finished product at 
release and throughout shelf life are appropriate for the dosage form. Where applicable, the 
specifications comply with the Ph. Eur. requirements and with ICH guidelines.  
Assay is consistent at release and is stable upon storage. A slightly wider specification limit at shelf-life 
has nevertheless been justified. 
The proposed acceptance criteria for specified impurities are based on toxicologically established safety 
limits.  
EMA/308908/2023  
Page 15/122 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Justifications for not controlling residual solvents, other impurities, chiral purity, physical state, and 
water content in the finished product are acceptable.  
An alternative method was initially proposed for assay. Following questions raised by the CHMP during 
the procedure, the alternative method has been removed from the application. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data 
using a validated ICP-MS method was provided, demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity 
was not detected above 30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment and the presented 
batch data it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls. The 
information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory.  
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product 
has been performed considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and 
answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 
726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the 
information provided, it is accepted that there is no specific risk of nitrosamine impurities in the active 
substance or the related finished product. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three batches per strength confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of finished product stored under long term 
conditions and under accelerated conditions according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The 
batches of finished product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the 
primary packaging proposed for marketing. Multiple different batches of active substance and of SDD 
were used to manufacture the primary stability batches. 
Samples were tested in line with the specification tests listed. All the results (long-term and 
accelerated) are compliant with specifications, no trend was evidenced. 
SDD stability studies are presented for multiple SDD batches. Data are available up to 24 months. 
Results are compliant with specifications in all storage conditions. A statement indicates that the 
finished product dating or shelf-life begins with the introduction of the SDD into the finished product 
process. An end-to-end stability study with finished product manufactured with SDD aged and does not 
present any different trends as compared to the primary stability data, which is acceptable. 
In addition, samples of the finished products were exposed to thermal/humidity stress testing (open 
dish) and was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug 
Substances and Products. In the open dish study, degradation products have increased but remained 
within the proposed commercial specification level. No significant change was observed in the photo-
stability study, the finished product is photostable. 
The analytical procedures used are stability indicating.  
EMA/308908/2023  
Page 16/122 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years, without any storage condition, as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as 
those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the 
use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the 
Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal 
products. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects  
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development 
of the active substance and the finished product, and their manufacturing processes. Design spaces 
have been proposed for several steps in the manufacture of the finished product intermediate and the 
finished products. The design spaces have been adequately established. The results of tests carried out 
indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead 
to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
No major objections on quality aspects were raised during the procedure. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

Pharmacology 
2.4.1.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The pharmacodynamic properties of pirtobrutinib were investigated in both in vitro and in vivo 
experimental systems, including BTK inhibition (potency and selectivity), comparability with other BTK 
inhibitors, target occupancy estimation and actions on animal models.

In vitro 
Inhibitory Activity of pirtobrutinib Against BTK and BTK C481S Proteins in vitro  
The activity of pirtobrutinib on WT and C418S human BTK enzymes (LOXO-305-PHARM-031) was 
analysed in an enzymatic assay by using radiolabelled ATP. Values obtained for IC50 indicated an 
inhibition potency within the nanomolar range for both enzymes (3.15 and 1.42nM respectively).  
Mechanism of Inhibition of BTK and BTK C481S by pirtobrutinib 
Lineweaver-Burk analysis was used to determine the mechanism of inhibition of the wild-type and 
C481S BTK enzymes by pirtobrutinib (LOXO-305-PHARM-039). The results (Figure 2) of the kinetic 
analysis showed that pirtobrutinib is a competitive inhibitor (non-parallel lines intersecting lines at the 
Y-axis).

C418S  
Effect of the pirtobrutinib metabolite M1, LOX-00023900-001, on BTK in Vitro Activity 
The metabolite M1 (LOX-00023900-001/LSN3828720), was also tested against BTK (LOXO-305-
PHARM-029). Results indicated M1 did not inhibit BTK activity in this test system (data now shown).  
Binding Activity of pirtobrutinib with BTK and BTK C481 Resistance Mutants Using Surface Plasmon 
Resonance (SPR) 
SPR assays (LOXO-305-PHARM-023, LOXO-305-PHARM-042) were performed to determine binding 
constants and kinetics of pirtobrutinib on common resistance mutations BTK protein. The average 
values of the dissociation equilibrium constant was 1.0nM for WT BTK and 1.7 nM for BTKC4181S.  
Inhibition of BTK and BTK C481 Resistance Mutants Transiently Expressed in Human Embryonic Kidney 
Cells 
The potency of pirtobrutinib was evaluated in a cell-based assay (catalytic activity of BTK after 
transient expression in HEK293T cells). WT BTK and relevant mutations at position C481 (C481S, 
C481T, C481G and C481R) were characterised. Other BTK inhibitors (ibrutinib, acalabrutinib, GDC-

Inhibition of BTK and BTK C481S Stably Expressed in Human Embryonic Kidney Cells 
Inhibition of BTK by pirtobrutinib and ibrutinib was compared in HEK293 cells stably expressing BTK 
wild type and the mutant form C481S (LOXO-305-PHARM-014). The results showed that pirtobrutinib 
inhibited autophosphorylation (Y223) of WT and C481S mutant expressing cells, while ibrutinib 
exhibited a similar potency for WT BTK but not for C418S mutant. 
Effect of pirtobrutinib on Cellular Signalling in Human Lymphoma Cell Lines 
Two cell lines involved in BTK dependent signalling (Ramos RA1 and TMD8) were used in these assays 
(LOXO-305-PHARM-013, LOXO-305-PHARM-040 and LOXO-305-PHARM-011). Ramos RA1 cells were 
shown to have BTK dependent signalling induced by activation of the B cell receptor (BCR) (Nisitani et 
al. 1999, Evans et al. 2013). TMD8 cells were characterised to be of the activated B-cell-like subtype of 
DLBCL (ABC-DLBCL) and dependent on BTK for survival (Davis et al. 2010). 
Both cell lines were treated with pirtobrutinib and lysates analysed for levels of phosphorylated BTK 
Y223 and PLCγ2 Y217. The results showed the inihibition BTK Y223 autophosphorylation with IC50 
values of nanomolar in TMD8 and Ramos RA1 cells, as well as PLCγ2 in Ramos RA1 (data not shown).  
Effect of pirtobrutinib on Cell Proliferation in Human B-Cell Lymphoma Cell Lines 
Pirtobrutinib inhibited cell proliferation of TMD8 and REC-1 cells with IC50 values of 2.33 nM and 3.13 
nM, respectively, indicating that it potently inhibits cell proliferation in both DLBCL and MCL cell line 
models  (LOXO-305-PHARM-040 and LOXO-305-PHARM-036). 
Inhibition of Human B-Cell Activation in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells and Whole Blood by 
pirtobrutinib and Demonstration of its Reversibility in Cells 
The effect of pirtobrutinib on the activation of human B-cells was investigated using human whole 
blood and PBMC (LOXO-305-PHARM-016). The results (Figure 05, left) revealed a dose dependent 
reduction of B-cells activation in both isolated PBMCs and B-cells in human whole blood as measured 
EMA/308908/2023

by inhibition of CD69 positive B-cells as detected with CD19 staining. This inhibitory effect was lost 
after washout, which is consistent with the potential reversibility of pirtobrutinib action (Figure 3). 
Figure 3. Pirtobrutinib inhibition of B-Cell activation in human peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells and human whole blood (top). Reversibility of the inhibition after washout (bottom)  
In Vitro Occupancy of BTK by Pirtobrutinib in Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells 
The in vitro occupancy of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) by pirtobrutinib was evaluated in human 
PBMCs collected from healthy donors. With this aim, a cell permeable fluorophore-conjugated probe 
derivative of pirtobrutinib to label unoccupied BTK was used (LOXO-305-PHARM-037). 
The assay showed pirtobrutinib with a dose-dependent occupancy of BTK in human PBMCs in vitro, 
resulting an EC50 value of 3.82 nM (3.24 nM adjusted). EC50 values were adjusted for FBS protein 
binding of 15.2% (LOXO-305-DMPK-016).  
Pirtobrutinib showed more than 95% mean BTK occupancy at a concentration of 300 nM, and more 
than 97% mean BTK occupancy at a concentration of 1,000 nM. When the pirtobrutinib concentration 
is adjusted for FBS binding, the 300 nM concentration with 95% mean BTK occupancy corresponded to 
a free concentration of 254 nM, which is similar to the unbound plasma Cmin of 266 nM at the 200 mg 
clinical dose. When adjusted for FBS binding, the 1000 nM concentration corresponded to a free 
concentration of 850 nM, which is approximately 1.5-fold higher than the unbound plasma Cmax of 
550 nM at the 200 mg clinical dose.

In vivo 
In Vivo Efficacy of pirtobrutinib in Human B-cell Lymphoma Xenograft Models in Immunocompromised 
Mice 
The in vivo effect of pirtobrutinib was evaluated in 3 tumour xenograft studies in mice (LOXO-305-
PHARM-010, LOXO-305-PHARM-038 and LOXO-305-PHARM-030).  
Treatment with pirtobrutinib caused tumour growth inhibition in the three models tested (Figure 4).  
Figure 4. Dose-dependent inhibition of tumour growth in human B-Cell lymphoma cell line 
xenograft tumour models  
OCI-Ly10 model, 88% and 95% at 10 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg BID compared to vehicle, respectively on 
day 28 (LOXO-305-PHARM-010); TMD8 model, 61% and 81% at 15 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg, respectively 
on day 14 of dosing compared to vehicle (LOXO-305-PHARM-038); and in REC-1 MCL xenograft model, 
80% and 84% at 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg BID, respectively, and tumour regression of -11% in the 50 
mg/kg BID group (LOXO-305-PHARM-030). 
All treatments were well-tolerated and no drug-related deaths occurred in the three lymphoma 
xenograft studies.  
In Vivo Efficacy of pirtobrutinib in a Human DLBCL BTK C481S Xenograft Model in 
Immunocompromised Mice 
The in vivo efficacy of pirtobrutinib was also evaluated in a human DLBCL TMD8 BTK C481S xenograft 
model (LOXO-035-PHARM-017). Pirtobrutinib treatment resulted in tumour growth inhibition at 10 
mg/kg and 30 mg/kg BID (-29% and -48%, respectively) compared to vehicle treated control (Figure 
5).

2.4.1.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies  
A screening assay (LOXO-305-PHARM-003) for inhibition of the kinase activity of 371 human wild-type 
kinases was reported with pirtobrutinib (1 µM is 320-fold greater than estimated IC50 value). Of the 
371 kinases, 9 (including BTK) had percent of control values less than 50 (equivalent to more than 
50% inhibition). Pirtobrutinib had the greatest inhibitory effect on BTK (data not shown). These 
kinases were additionally investigated in an assay (LOXO-305-PHARM-031) using radiolabelled ATP at 
a concentration near Km value. The IC50 values estimated for ERBB4, MEK2, BRK, MEK1, TXK, CSK, 
YES1, FYN and TEC were 13.25 nM, 82.7 nM, 54.25 nM, 147 nM, 209 nM, 552 nM, 157 nM, 1710 nM, 
and 1234 nM, respectively.  
In a cell-based assay using a cell permeable fluorescent NanoBRET tracer (LOXO-305-PHARM-033), 
IC50 values for BTK, TEC and BRK were 0.66 nM, 70.46 nM, and 360.47 nM, respectively. In the case of 
TXK, YES1, CSK and FYN, cellular values were determined to be > 5 µM, the highest concentration 
tested. 
The effect of pirtobrutinib on different kinases was investigated in additional cell-based assays (LOXO-
305-PHARM-034 and LOXO-305-PHARM-035), in which pirtobrutinib did not inhibit these enzymes 
(Table 2).

Effect of pirtobrutinib at other receptors and enzymes 
Pirtobrutinib was profiled in radioligand binding assays, and enzyme and uptake assays to detect 
potential off-target activity. Pirtobrutinib was evaluated at a concentration of 1 μM against 44 targets 
in radioligand binding, enzyme and uptake assays, which included primary molecular targets, 
transmembrane and soluble receptors, ion channels, monoamine transporters, and enzymes 
(LOXO305-PHARM-004). There was no significant inhibition (≥50%) of receptors or enzymes 
evaluated. The concentration of 1 μM is approximately 1.8-fold higher than the preliminary human PK 
unbound Cmax of 0.55 μM at the 200 mg clinical dose. 
2.4.1.3.  Safety pharmacology programme  
Effects of LOXO-305 on Cloned hERG Potassium Channels Expressed in Human Embryonic Kidney Cells 
(LOXO-305-SPHARM-003) 
In this in vitro GLP study, pirtobrutinib inhibited the hERG channel with an IC50 of 32 μM (15 μg/mL). 
This is 55-fold higher than the preliminary unbound or free human Cmax at 200 mg with 95.4% protein 
binding, 0.27 μg/mL, in humans. 
LOXO-305: Effects on the Cardiovascular System in the Naïve Conscious Dog using Radiotelemetry 
Following Oral Administration (LOXO-305-SPHARM-002) 
In this GLP study, dogs were administered with pirtobrutinib at 5, 20 or 60 mg/Kg on test sessions 1-4 
(once weekly). Sessions 5 and 6 were for TK sampling, with no CV assessment. Endpoints and 
parameters recorded in this study were: haemodynamic data (heart rate and systolic, diastolic and 
mean arterial pressures); body temperature; and ECG parameters (PR, RR, QRS, QT, QTc). 
Pirtobrutinib had no effect on any parameter or endpoints assessed in this study. The exposure at the 
NOEL for cardiovascular effects in this study was approximately 6.5-fold higher than preliminary 
human exposure at 200 mg QD (Table 11, see also Table 15 in pharmacokinetics section).

Distribution 
Tissue Distribution 
Male pigmented (Long Evans) rats were analysed by Quantitative Whole Body Autoradiography 
(QWBA) after receiving radiolabelled pirtobrutinib, 35 mg/kg dose containing 200 μCi/kg of 
radioactivity (LOXO-305-DMPK-035). Animals were analysed for 168 hours post dose. 
Pirtobrutinib-associated radioactivity was highly distributed. The highest radioactivity concentrations 
were measured at 1 or 2 hours postdose for most of the tissues. The tissues exposed to the highest 
calculated radiation were oesophagus, gastrointestinal (GI) organs, urinary bladder, epididymis, liver, 
uveal tract, pigmented skin, and testis.  
The radioactivity declined over time to below the lower limit of quantitation (< 178 ng-eq) by 168 
hours post dose for all tissues but the uveal tract and liver (294 and 262 ng-eq, respectively at 168 
hours), with a calculated t1/2 of 66.4 and 56.1 hours, respectively. Distribution of [14C]pirtobrutinib 
related material to the testis and regions of the brain was rapid with measurable concentrations by 1 
hour. The levels in both the testis and the brain then declined to below the lower limit of quantitation 
by 24 hours.

Protein binding 
Plasma protein binding (PPB) values for rat and dog plasma were determined in study LOXO-305-
DMPK-016. The results are shown in Table 12. 
Table 12. Plasma Protein binding in rat and dog (LOXO-305-DMPK-016)  
Red Blood Cell Partitioning 
The B:P ratio of pirtobrutinib was measured in rat and dog blood (LOXO-305-DMPK-009), resulting in 
0.84 and 0.88, respectively. 
In study LOXO-305-DMPK-035, B:P ratio of total radioactivity was measured. For male rats the B:P 
ratio ranged from 0.595 to 0.774 over the 72-hour time course. For female rats (N = 3 rats/time 
point) the B:P ratios were ranged from 0.701 to 0.815. The B:P ratio did not show time dependence. 
Placental transfer studies were not submitted. 
Metabolism 
In vitro 
In vitro metabolism of pirtobrutinib was investigated in human, rat (Sprague Dawley), dog (Beagle) 
and non-human primate (Cynomolgus) co-cultured hepatocytes (LOXO-305-DMPK-037). 
In humans, the in vitro metabolism of pirtobrutinib showed metabolic pathways consistent with 
hydroxylation (metabolites E and H), N-glucuronidation (A), O-demethylation followed by 
glucuronidation (C), and hydroxylation followed by glucuronidation (B). The in vitro human metabolites 
were detected in rat and/or dog. Addition of the pan-CYP450 inhibitor ABT to the incubations showed 
significant decrease in the formation of metabolites B, C, E and H indicating that their formation is 
P450 dependent. 
In vivo 
In Sprague Dawley rats, a dedicated radiolabelled study was conducted after a single PO dose of 35 
mg/kg (approximately 100 μCi/kg) of [14C]pirtobrutinib in bile-duct intact (intact) and bile-duct 
cannulated (BDC) animals (LOXO-305-DMPK-049). Results are shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6. Proposed Metabolic Pathway for Pirtobrutinib in Rats  
In time averaged plasma AUC0-24h pools from intact male rats, a total of eight metabolites and one 
process impurity were quantified and identified.  
In the AUC0-24h male sample, metabolites M1 and M5 concentrations were greater than pirtobrutinib, 
each individually representing 33.9% (M1), 20.1% (M5) and 17.9% (pirtobrutinib) of Total 
Radioactivity (TRA). The remaining plasma metabolites were considered minor each individually 
representing ≤ 3.7% of the TRA.  
In the intact female rat plasma time averaged AUC0-24h pool, a total of three metabolites and one 
process impurity were quantified and identified.  
In the AUC0-24h female sample, pirtobrutinib was the predominant component representing 74.2% of 
the TRA, while each of the remaining metabolites were considered minor each individually representing 
≤ 5.6% of the TRA.  
In male and female intact and BDC rats, urinary excretion was low (≤ 3%). Pirtobrutinib and 4 trace 
metabolites were found in urine (each representing ≤ 0.6% of dose). In male and female intact rats 
the majority of radioactivity was recovered in faeces (≥ 93%). From BDC rats the majority of 
radioactivity was recovered in bile and faeces with 52% and 39% of the dose recovered in bile, and 
41% and 54% of the dose recovered in faeces from male and female rats, respectively. In rat faeces 
from intact male and female rats, pirtobrutinib was the largest component observed (57.7% M and 
72.9% F). A sulfamate M10 (12.3% M, 1.8% F), O-desmethyl pirtobrutinib (M11, 5.7% M, 10.3% F) 
and process impurity LSN3563791 (3.4% M, 3.9% F) were identified in faeces of both males and 
females, while a direct glucuronide conjugate M14 (5.4% M) was identified only in male. In BDC rat 
EMA/308908/2023  
Page 30/122 
 
 
  
 
 
 
faeces, pirtobrutinib was the major component (34.8% M, 47.3% F), while two metabolites M10 (3.5% 
M, 0.7% F) and M11 (0.9% M, 2.9% F) and process impurity LSN3563791 were minor. In bile from the 
BDC rats, pirtobrutinib (14.8% M, 9.7% F), N-glucuronide M2 (LSN3829057, 3.8% M, 5.9% F), mono-
oxy glucuronides M3 (10.5% M, 6.2% F) and M4 (16.8% M, 11.8% F) and O-desmethyl glucuronide 
M12 (1.3% M, 1.5% F) were identified. 
Relative Exposure of Metabolites in Rat, Dog, and Human 
In human plasma only three minor metabolites (M1, M2, and M4) were identified/quantified in the 
exploratory human plasma study (LOXO-305-DMPK-039), and in the [14C]pirtobrutinib study (LOXO-
BTK-20007). In the human [14C]pirtobrutinib study (LOXO-BTK-20007) the mean percentages of 
pirtobrutinib, M1, M2 and M4 relative to total circulating radioactivity across subjects were 86.7%, 
7.8%, 3.3% and 2.3%, respectively. After administration of [14C]pirtobrutinib to rat (LOXO-305-DMPK-
049) all three human circulating metabolites were observed. 
In study LOXO-305-DMPK-052, human, rat and dog plasma were evaluated for the relative steady 
state exposure to pirtobrutinib metabolites M1, M2 and M4.  
The relative exposure multiples for metabolite M1 were 17.97 and 18.79 in male and female rats and 
0.05 and 0.04 in male and female dogs, respectively. Relative exposure multiples for M2 were 0.91 
and 2.28 for male and female rats and were 0.23, and 0.35 for male and female dogs, respectively. 
Relative exposure multiples for M4 were 0.57 and 0.05 in male and female rats, respectively and M4 
was below limit of detection in male and female dogs. Therefore, at relevant toxicological doses at 
steady state, the relative exposure multiples for M1 in rat provides adequate metabolite coverage. 
Since metabolites M2 and M4 were < 10% of total circulating radioactivity and are glucuronides, there 
is no need for further evaluation. 
Excretion 
The excretion and mass balance of pirtobrutinib was evaluated in male and female Sprague Dawley 
rats (LOXO-305-DMPK-035). In intact rats, approximately 96% of the administered dose was excreted 
in the first 48 hours post dose. The majority of the radioactivity was recovered in faeces, with a mean 
of 95.7% and 94.9% for male and female rats, respectively, excreted through 120 hours post dose. 
Urinary excretion of administered radioactivity was a mean of 1.72 and 3.64% for male and female 
rats, respectively, through 120 hours post dose. The mean overall recovery was 98.0 and 99.3% of the 
administered dose for male and female rats, respectively. 
In BDC rats, the mean total recovery of radioactivity was 96.2 and 97.0%, for male and female rats, 
respectively, of which approximately 94% (males) and 96% (females) was excreted in the first 48 
hours post dose. Bile, urine, and faeces accounted for 52.2, 1.40, and 41.6% of the administered dose 
for males, respectively, and 39.4, 3.04, and 53.7% for females, respectively, through 120 hours post 
dose.  
The renal excretion of pirtobrutinib was also studied after IV administration (LOXO-305-DMPK-005). 
Pirtobrutinib was administered intravenously at 1 mg/kg in male and female Sprague Dawley rats. 
Urine was collected for 24 hours. Pirtobrutinib in the urine was measured by LC-MS/MS. From 0-8 
hours, < 0.2% of the pirtobrutinib dose was eliminated in urine. After 24 hours the percent of dose in 
the urine was less than 0.6% for both male and female rats.

2.4.3.  Toxicology  
2.4.3.1.  Single dose toxicity  
No single-dose toxicity studies of pirtobrutinib were submitted. The applicant estimated the dose levels 
tolerated for each species (rat and dog) based on the clinical symptoms reported in the repeat-dose 
toxicity studies.  
Female rats tolerated 375 mg/kg BID for 14 days in LOXO-305-TOX-003, so it was estimated that the 
rat LD50 is ≥ 375 mg/kg BID. In the case of dogs, they tolerated 35 mg/kg BID for 14-days (LOXO-
305-TOX-004), so dog LD50 value is ≥ 35 mg/kg BID.  
2.4.3.2.  Repeat dose toxicity  
Designs of the studies included here are described in the pharmacokinetics section of this report. 
A 14-Day Repeated-Dose Toxicity Study in Sprague-Dawley Rat (LOXO-305-TOX-003, non-GLP): 
Pirtobrutinib effects were limited to minor decreases in body weight, lymphoid organ effects, bone 
marrow effects, and rat-specific pancreatic findings. The NOAEL was 500 mg/kg BID in males, due to 
adverse bone marrow effects at 1000 mg/kg BID, and 75 mg/kg BID in females, due to adverse bone 
marrow effects at 175 mg/kg BID. 
A 28-Day Toxicity and Toxicokinetic Study of LOXO-305 in Sprague-Dawley Rats with a 28 Day 
Recovery Phase (LOXO-305-TOX-007, GLP) 
.Pirtobrutinib effects were limited to minor decreases in body weight, minor lymphoid organ effects, 
and rat-specific pancreatic findings. Due to the mild severity of findings and the lack of impact on the 
health and well-being of the treated animals, effects at all doses were non-adverse. Thus, the NOAEL is 
500 mg/kg BID in males and 175 mg/kg BID in females. 
A 3-Month Toxicity and Toxicokinetic Study of LY3527727 Administered by Oral Gavage Twice Daily to 
Rats (LOXO-305-TOX-018, GLP) 
In this GLP study, pirtobrutinib was administered to Sprague Dawley rats at 0, 50, or 500 mg/kg in 
males or 0, 60, 300 mg/kg in females BID via oral gavage for 15 weeks. Exposures generally increased 
with increasing dose in males and females. Despite lower dose levels, exposure was generally higher in 
female rats compared to male rats. Pirtobrutinib effects were limited to minor decreases in body 
weight, lymphoid organ and immune system effects, and rat-specific pancreatic findings. Lymphoid 
organ effects consisted of decreased cellularity, accompanied by a relative decrease in B lymphocytes 
and a decrease or elimination of T-cell dependent antibody response (TDAR). These effects were 
considered likely related to the pharmacologic mechanism of action of pirtobrutinib. The NOAEL was 50 
mg/kg BID in males, due to adverse effects on the TDAR response at 500 mg/kg BID, and 300 mg/kg 
BID in females, the highest dose tested in females. 
A 14-Day Oral Dose Range-Finding Tolerability and Toxicokinetic Study of LOXO-305 in Beagle Dogs 
(LOX 305-TOX-004, non-GLP) 
In this study dogs did not tolerate 60/120 mg/kg BID. 
Pirtobrutinib effects were observed in stomach, bone marrow, and lymphoid organs. The NOAEL was 
35/70 mg/kg BID, due to mortality and adverse bone marrow effects at 60/120 mg/kg BID. 
EMA/308908/2023  
Page 32/122 
 
 
  
 
 
A 28-Day Twice-Daily Oral Gavage Toxicity and Toxicokinetic Study of LOXO-305 in Beagle Dogs with a 
28-Day Recovery Phase (LOXO-305-TOX-008, GLP) 
Dogs did not tolerate 90/60 mg/kg BID or 30 mg/kg BID. The 90/60 mg/kg BID group was euthanised 
on Day 13 (hypoactivity, dehydration, elevated body temperature, mucoid or red faeces, and 
decreases in circulating blood cells, particularly neutrophils). The 30 mg/kg BID group (hypoactivity, 
recumbency, non-formed faeces, vomitus and elevated temperature.) was lowered to 10 mg/kg BID, 
necessitating the lowering of the 10 mg/kg BID group to 5 mg/kg BID. There were no body weight 
effects observed in the low and mid dose groups, but a decreased body weight gain was observed in 
high dose animals. 
Pirtobrutinib effects were observed in bone marrow, lymphoid organs, gastrointestinal tract, and lungs. 
All findings were reversible. The NOAEL was 10/5 mg/kg BID, due to adverse bone marrow, 
gastrointestinal and lung effects at ≥ 30/10 mg/kg BID.  
A 3 Month Toxicity and Toxicokinetic Study of LY3527727/HPMC-AS-M as a Spray Dried Dispersion 
Administered by Twice Daily Oral Gavage to Dogs (LOXO-305-TOX-017, GLP) 
Pirtobrutinib effects were observed in the cornea and lymphoid organs. Minimal to mild corneal lesions  
were observed in two high dose dogs at systemic exposure below human exposure at 200 mg QD. In 
addition, pirtobrutinib caused a decrease in B lymphocytes and a decrease in the TDAR following KLH 
immunisation. 
The NOAEL was 2.5 mg/kg BID, due to adverse eye effects at 5 mg/kg BID. This dose level 
corresponds to a mean sex-combined Cmax value of 1.73 μg/mL, and an AUC(0-24) value of 15.6 
hr*μg/mL, on Day 105. 
2.4.3.3.  Genotoxicity  
Bacterial Reverse Mutation Assay (LOXO-305-TOX-009, GLP) 
In the Ames test, pirtobrutinib did not induce mutation in four histidine-requiring strains of Salmonella 
typhimurium, and one tryptophan-requiring strain of Escherichia coli in the absence or in the presence 
of a rat liver metabolic-activation system (S9). 
REDX08608: In Vitro Microwell Micronucleus Screening Assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells (LOXO-
305-TOX-013, non-GLP) 
Pirtobrutinib was negative for the induction of micronuclei under the conditions of the study. It did not 
induce a significant increase in the frequency of bi-nucleated cells with micronuclei at any dose level 
when compared with the concurrent solvent control group in S9-activated or non-activated 3-hour 
treatment series, but a dose-related increase (Cochran-Armitage analysis, p ≤ 0.05) was observed in 
the non-activated 3-hour treatment series. In the non-activated 24-hour treatment series, a significant 
increase in the frequency of MN-BN cells was observed at 5 μg/mL and a dose-related increase in 
micronucleus frequency was identified by Cochran-Armitage analysis (p ≤ 0.05). However, the increase 
was within the range of the historical negative control data (0.72% to 2.05%). Thus, the significant 
increase and the dose-related increase in the frequency of MN-BN cells were considered not to be a 
positive signal of micronucleus induction. 
In Vitro Mammalian Cell Micronucleus Assay in HPBL (LOXO-305-TOX-010, GLP) 
Pirtobrutinib was positive for the induction of micronuclei in the absence and presence of the 
exogenous metabolic activation system (Table 13).

LOXO-305: In Vitro Human Lymphocyte Micronucleus Assay with Mechanistic Fluorescent in situ 
Hybridisation (FISH) Analysis of Micronuclei (LOXO-305-TOX-014, GLP) 
Pirtobrutinib was positive for the induction of micronuclei under the conditions of this study at 
concentrations ≥ 12 µg/mL. Based on the high level of centromere-positive staining, the micronuclei 
were induced via a predominantly aneugenic mechanism (chromosome loss). 
In addition, the applicant estimated a presented a safe exposure limit for the potential aneugenic 
effects of pirtobrutinib. It was based on the NOEL values obtained in the micronuclei assays (Table 
14).

Protein binding in humans is 95.4% 
In Vivo Mammalian Erythrocyte Micronucleus Assay in Rats (LOXO-305-TOX-016, GLP) 
Pirtobrutinib was tested for the ability to induce micronuclei in rat bone marrow. Rats were given a 
single dose of vehicle, 0.5% (w/v) hydroxypropyl methylcellulose in deionised water, or 250, 500, 
1000 or 2000 mg/kg pirtobrutinib by oral gavage. Pirtobrutinib was negative for the induction of 
micronuclei up to the limit dose of 2000 mg/kg (data not shown). 
2.4.3.4.  Carcinogenicity  
No carcinogenicity studies with pirtobrutinib were submitted as these studies are not warranted for 
advanced cancer indications (ICH S9).

2.4.3.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity  
An Enhanced Pilot Embryo-fetal Development Study of LY3527727 Administered by Oral Gavage Twice 
Daily to Rats (LOXO-305-TOX-019, GLP) 
Female rats were given pirtobrutinib by twice daily oral gavage at doses of 25, 75, 375 and 500 mg/kg 
BID on Days 6 to 17 postcoitum.  
There were no adverse maternal effects at any dose. Embryolethality was evidenced at 1000 
mg/kg/day by higher numbers of resorptions and a higher post-implantation loss. Adverse effects on 
embryo-foetal development were evidenced at ≥ 750 mg/kg/day by foetal dysmorphology 
(malformations and variations) and effects on foetal growth (foetotoxicity). Based on these results, the 
maternal NOAEL was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day (maternal Cmax 21.6 μg/mL and AUC(0-24) 
331 hr*μg/mL on Day 17 pc), and the embryo-foetal development NOAEL was considered to be 150 
mg/kg/day (maternal Cmax 7.03 μg/mL and AUC(0-24) 106 hr*μg/mL on Day 17 pc). 
2.4.3.6.  Toxicokinetic data  
See the pharmacokinetics section. 
2.4.3.7.  Local tolerance  
No local tolerance studies were conducted with pirtobrutinib, given the oral route of delivery. 
2.4.3.8.  Other toxicity studies  
A neutral red uptake phototoxicity assay in BALB/c mouse 3T3 fibroblasts was used to assess the 
phototoxicity of pirtobrutinib ((LOXO-305-TOX-005, GLP). Pirtobrutinib did not have phototoxic 
potential in this assay. 
2.4.3.9.  Studies on impurities  
Three impurities were specified at limits above the ICH Q3A and Q3B qualification threshold: 
- LSN3804363 (enantiomer) in drug substance: 1% 
- Sum of LSN3849804 and LSN3849825 in drug product: 1.3% 
LSN3804363 (enantiomer) was qualified in the 28-day repeat-dose studies of pirtobrutinib at 1% in 
rats and dogs. LSN3849804 and LSN3849825 were individually qualified at 1.3% in a 14-day repeat-
dose study in rats (Report LOXO-305-TOX-020). 
Impurity LSN3804363 is an enantiomer of pirtobrutinib. As an enantiomer, the applicant notes that 
LSN3804363 is expected to behave very similarly to pirtobrutinib in genotoxicity studies. Therefore, 
LSN3804363 was not tested in an Ames study, but is expected to be negative, as pirtobrutinib was 
negative in an Ames study. In addition, the risk of induction of chromosome aberrations by 
LSN3804363 is expected to be very similar to the risk from pirtobrutinib.  
Impurities LSN3849804 and LSN3849825 were negative in Ames tests. While the risk of the induction 
of chromosome aberrations for LSN3849804 and LSN3849825 is unknown, the additional risk of 
chromosome aberrations from low exposures to LSN3849804 and LSN3849825 is expected to be 
negligible relative to the risk from exposure to pirtobrutinib. Therefore, studies assessing chromosome 
aberration induced by LSN3849804 and LSN3849825 are not warranted.

2.4.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects  
Primary pharmacodynamic studies showed a potency for BTK inhibition by pirtobrutinib within the 
nanomolar range. This inhibition was characterised as a competitive inhibition of BTK wild type and 
C418 mutants, after a Lineweaver-Burk analysis. The main metabolite M1 showed no activity on BTK 
inhibition assays.  
BTK occupancy was also determined. A 95% of receptor occupancy was reported at 300 nM (254 nM 
adjusted), which is comparable to the value obtained for unbound plasma Cmin (266 nM) at the 200 
mg clinical dose. At 1000 nM (850 nM adjusted) in the in vitro assays with PBMCs, the value exhibited 
1.5-fold the unbound plasma Cmax of 550 nM. 
In vivo xenograft models demonstrated the growth inhibition of tumours after pirtobrutinib treatment. 
No off-target action is expected, given that no significant results were obtained in the tested panels. 
In terms of safety pharmacology assessment, potential cardiovascular effects were investigated in 
dedicated studies, in which pirtobrutinib had no effect on any parameter or endpoints assessed.  
Respiratory and central nervous systems were analysed via endpoints incorporated to the repeat dose 
toxicity studies, in line with ICH S7A guideline. The applicant reported no effect on CNS and respiratory 
systems.

The absence of pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies with pirtobrutinib studies is acceptable as 
no issues were identified that warranted such studies. 
For the pharmacokinetics characterisation, pirtobrutinib was investigated in rats and dogs after single 
or multiple doses. Different formulations were tested, with the highest bioavailability reported for the 
SDD formulation (amorphous form), which was selected for the repeat dose toxicity studies. The 
results of the toxicokinetic studies showed no accumulation after chronic administration of 
pirtobrutinib. In rats a greater exposure in females than in males was reported (also observed under 
feeding conditions), although no sex difference in dogs was noted in chronic studies. 
Tissue distribution study informed for the extended distribution of the radiolabelled compound, 
especially in the uveal tract and liver. Likewise, pigmented skin was one of the tissues with the highest 
radio signal. Additional phototoxicity assay (BALB/c 3T3 mouse fibroblasts) concluded no phototoxic 
potential for pirtobrutinib. Other tissues, such as testis and brain showed rapid absorption (1 hour) 
followed by exposure declination at 24 hours post dose (below limit of quantification). Despite the 
exposure levels presented in the brain, the applicant reported no effect in CNS-endpoints and 
locomotor activity evaluated in the 1-month rat study.  
PPB in rats and dogs was moderate, and blood-to-plasma ratio values were similar in rats and dogs.  
The major excretion route (via bile) was faecal elimination, with limited urinary excretion.  
The potential placental transfer and excretion in milk were not investigated in nonclinical species. 
With regards to the toxicological profile of pirtobrutinib, general toxicity, genotoxicity, embryo-foetal 
development, phototoxicity and impurities studies have been presented. The duration of the chronic 
studies (up to 3 months) is in line with ICH guideline S9. 
Key findings in rats consisted of lymphoid organ effects and decreases in B lymphocytes and other 
markers of immune system function. Lymphoid organ effects commonly consisted of decreases in size, 
weight, or cellularity of spleen, lymph nodes, and gut-associated lymphoid tissue. These findings were 
generally not adverse, as they did not impact the well-being of the animals and are consistent with the 
intended pharmacology of pirtobrutinib and the clinical safety profile.  
Effects on immune system function consisted of a shift in the balance of T, B, and NK lymphocytes, 
largely due to a decrease in B lymphocytes, and decreased TDAR response to KLH, a foreign antigen. 
With the exception of the anti-KLH TDAR in male rats, these effects were not considered adverse due 
to the lack of effect on the overall well-being of the animals. While in most animals the TDAR was 
suppressed but not eliminated, the TDAR to KLH was eliminated in many male rats. Thus, the effect 
was considered adverse in male rats and is described in the product information as it was observed at 
0.69-fold human exposure (at the recommended dose of 200 mg based on AUC). 
Effects on lymphoid organs and immune system were also reported in dogs and similarly was 
attributed to the pharmacological action of pirtobrutinib. Gastrointestinal tract, lungs and eye were also 
affected in dog studies. Corneal lesions were only observed in 2 dogs treated for 3 months. To date, 
this has not been identified as a drug class toxicity and has not been identified as a significant safety 
finding in the human population but is nevertheless described in the product information as it was 
observed at 0.42-fold human exposure (at the recommended dose of 200 mg based on AUC).  
Pirtobrutinib was not mutagenic in a bacterial mutagenicity (Ames) assay. Pirtobrutinib was aneugenic 
in two in vitro micronucleus assays using human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Pirtobrutinib had no 
effect in an in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay at doses up to 2 000 mg/kg (single dose), 
which is approximately 11-fold higher exposure (considering unbound Cmax value in female animals) 
than human exposure at 200 mg. As a potential foetal harm when pirtobrutinib is administered to a 
pregnant woman cannot be excluded,  women of childbearing potential should use an effective method 
EMA/308908/2023  
Page 38/122 
 
 
  
 
 
of contraception during treatment and for 5 weeks after the last dose of pirtobrutinib. Men are advised 
to use an effective method of contraception and not father a child during treatment and for 3 months 
after the last dose of pirtobrutinib.  
The absence of carcinogenicity studies is in line with ICH guideline S9 and the assessment relied on the 
lack of hyperplastic changes in chronic studies (up to 3 months).  
The studies in pregnant animals revealed similar exposures to non-pregnant animals. 
For the reproductive toxicity assessment, the absence of fertility and PPND studies is in line with ICH 
guideline S9. Administration of pirtobrutinib to pregnant rats during organogenesis resulted in 
decreased foetal weight, embryo foetal mortality, and foetal malformations at maternal exposures 3.0-
fold human exposure at the recommended dose of 200 mg based on AUC and is reflected in the 
product information (section 5.3).  
The excretion of pirtobrutinib in milk has not been investigated but breastfeeding is not recommended 
(see clinical section). 
The absence of local tolerance studies is acceptable, considering the intended route of administration. 
No additional immunotoxicity studies were considered necessary, considering the proposed mechanism 
of action for pirtobrutinib. 
ERA 
In the Phase I exposure assessment, the PECsurface water for pirtobrutinib 0.0094 µg/L almost met 
the EMA guideline action limit of 0.01 µg/L. Therefore, a Phase II Tier A assessment was triggered. 
The Log KOW values were <4.5 at environmentally relevant pH-range and pirtobrutinib was thus not 
considered a PBT substance in the screening for persistence, bioaccumulation, and toxicity (PBT). As 
these log KOW values also were <3, a bioconcentration study in Tier B was not triggered. 
The KOC for pirtobrutinib was below 10000 L/kg for sludge, not triggering the Tier B for the terrestrial 
compartment. Pirtobrutinib was primarily partitioned to the sediment layers. A Phase II Tier B 
extended effects on water sediment was therefore triggered. 
Based on the PEC/PNEC ratios for microorganisms, surface water, ground water and sediment were 
below the trigger ratios, no further evaluation of pirtobrutinib was needed in Tier B. 
Pirtobrutinib is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.4.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

2.5.2.  Clinical pharmacology  
2.5.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics  
Two different tablet formulations were developed (T1 and T2). The T1 tablet formulation (25 mg and 
100 mg tablets) was used in the majority of the Phase 1 portion of the pivotal Phase 1/2 study (LOXO-
BTK-18001) and in study LOXO-BTK-20014. T2 of 25 mg and 100 mg tablet strengths have been used 
in the clinical programme and was used in all other clinical pharmacology studies. T2 was also used in 
the majority of the Phase 2 portion of LOXO-BTK-18001 in strengths of 25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg 
tablets. However, PK data using the 50 mg strength tablet in LOXO-BTK-18001, were not available at 
the time of this application.  
The PK of pirtobrutinib has been investigated by non-compartmental analysis (NCA), as well as by 
population PK modelling and simulation, The exposure-response (E-R) relationship for efficacy and 
safety was also investigated using modelling and simulation techniques.  
Pharmacokinetics in target population  
In  total,  4487  evaluable  pirtobrutinib  concentrations  obtained  from  595  patients  in  study  LOXO-BTK-
18001 were included in the population PK analysis.  
In total, 66% of the analysed patients were male and 34% female. MCL was diagnosed in 140 patients 
(23%), while the majority of the patients had CLL/SLL (44%, n=263), and 192 patients (32%) had other 
NHL diagnoses. Overall, 210 patients (35%) received pirtobrutinib as formulation T1 and 385 patients 
(65%) as formulation T2. In total, 510 patients (85.7%) in the PK dataset received doses of 200 mg 
pirtobrutinib. PK data of the other doses of 25, 50, 100, 150, 250, and 300 mg were available from 5, 
6, 9, 20, 25, and 20 patients (in total about 14.3%). 
The final population PK model (Figure 7) is a linear 2-compartment model with 4 transit absorption 
compartments leading to a typical population MTT of 1.14 h (IIV = 23.8% CV, IOV = 43.6% CV). F 
was fixed to 1. The typical population CL was estimated to 2.04 L/h (37.7% CV) with volume of 
distributions of 29 L (Vc) and 23 L (Vp; 35.4% CV). Allometric scaling was applied for CL, Q, Vc, and 
Vp. A median body weight of 70 kg was used. For CL and Q the estimated factor was 0.392, and for Vc 
and Vp a factor of 0.806 was estimated. In addition, eGFR and albumin were identified as statistically 
significant covariates on CL (factor 0.00289 and – 0.668, respectively). Albumin was identified as 
covariate on Vc (factor -0.583). RSE (or SEE) were low (≤ 30.7%) and the proportional residual error 
was estimated to 19.7% (2.49% RSE).

Absorption  
Based on population PK analysis the estimated mean transit time (MTT) was 1.14 h with IIV = 23.8% 
CV and IOV = 43.6% CV. The IOV in MTT could maybe be partly explained by an influence of food 
intake later during the study, which slightly affects tmax. The influence of the varying MTT was 
considered to minimally affect exposure metrics and thus not anticipated to impact clinical outcome.  
Pirtobrutinib has a moderate rate of absorption with the median Tmax reached in approximately 2 
hours in fasted state. Absolute bioavailability study indicated that pirtobrutinib is a highly permeable 
compound having absolute bioavailability 85.5%. Solubility of pirtobrutinib is pH-independent in 
relevant GI pH range and in in vivo study it was confirmed that administration of gastric acid reducing 
agents do not result in a clinically relevant effect on exposure. 
Among the 595 patients from study LOXO-BTK-18001 included in the population PK analysis 210 
(35%) received formulation T1 and 385 (65%) formulation T2. Based on population PK analysis tablet 
formulation type (T1 and T2) was not identified as a statistically significant covariate. For the to-be-
marketed formulation T2, geometric mean AUC0-24,ss is about 88800 ng*h/mL (66% CV), Cmax,ss = 
6270 ng/mL (63% CV), and Cmin,ss = 2210 (88% CV), after administration of 200 mg (i.e. 2x 100 mg) 
QD. For the T1 formulation results are similar: AUC0-24,ss = 92500 ng*h/mL (51% CV), Cmax,ss = 6360 
ng/mL (51% CV), and Cmin,ss = 2340 (71% CV), after administration of 200 mg (i.e. 2x 100 mg) QD. 
Overall, exposures appear comparable between both formulations after administration of 200 mg QD. 
For Phase 2 patients who received the proposed dose of 200 mg QD, popPK model-estimated mean 
Cmax,ss, Cmin,ss, and AUC0-24,ss were 6460 ng/mL (26% CV), 2260 ng/mL (65% CV), and 91300 
ng*h/mL (41% CV), respectively. 
The to-be-marketed formulation T2 was tested as 100 mg strength only and the 50 mg tablet has not 
been administered yet and no PK results are available. No bioequivalence study was presented.

To bridge the different tablets used in the development, the applicant presented a biowaiver 
based on the following: Both 50 mg and 100 mg drug product are tablet dosage forms. The 
pharmaceutical products are manufactured by the same manufacturing process. 
The composition of the different strengths is quantitatively proportional.

• 
The dissolution profile similarity test result (25 mg versus 50 mg and 50 mg versus 100 mg) 
meets the criteria of f2 > 50, indicating similarity of dissolution profiles. The in vitro dissolution 
tests demonstrate similar performance of the dosage form across the dose strengths. 
Pirtobrutinib has linear disposition pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range as 
demonstrated by a lack of dose dependence of MTT or CL/F. 
Pirtobrutinib exhibited dose proportional pharmacokinetics across the 25 mg to 300 mg QD 
dose range in patients and the 300 mg to 800 mg single dose range in healthy participants.  
In Study LOXO-BTK-20014, a standard breakfast administered to healthy participants decreased the 
Cmax of pirtobrutinib by 20% and delayed Tmax by 0.5 hours. There was no effect on pirtobrutinib 
AUC. 
In Study LOXO-BTK-20009, high-fat high-calorie meal administered to healthy participants decreased 
the Cmax of pirtobrutinib by 22.5% and delayed Tmax by 1 hour. There was no effect on pirtobrutinib 
AUC. 
Distribution  
Based on population PK analysis the typical overall pirtobrutinib overall volume of distribution (V) is 52 
L with 29 L for the central compartment (Vc) and 23 L for the peripheral compartment (Vp). 
Pirtobrutinib is ≈96% protein bound and protein binding appears to be concentration independent. In 
blood, pirtobrutinib is mainly distributed into plasma (mean blood to-plasma ratio 0.79) and found to 
bind predominantly to the albumin. Renal impairment had no impact on the extent of pirtobrutinib 
protein binding. 
Body weight was identified as statistically significant covariate on Vc and Vp with an estimated factor 
of 0.806. Decreasing body weight (35 kg) is associated with a decreasing V (Vc of about L16.6 L (- 
42%)) and increasing body weight (150 kg) with an increasing V (Vc of about 53.6 L for), (+84%), 
compared to a population typical body weight of 70 kg.   
Serum albumin was identified as statistically significant covariate on Vc with an estimated factor of -
0.583. Lower baseline serum albumin (19 to 37 g/L) is associated with an increasing Vc of about 31 to 
45 L) (+ 6 to 56%) and higher baseline serum albumin (>44 g/L) with a decreasing Vc of about 24 L ), 
(- 17%), compared to a population typical baseline serum albumin level of 41 g/L.  
NC analysis confirmed the population PK estimate for distribution as results from both analyses 
appeared similar. 
Elimination  
Based on population PK analysis the typical pirtobrutinib clearance (CL) is 2.04 L/h (IIV 37.7% CV), 
the mean elimination half-life of is estimated to be 18.8 hours (37% CV) and the typical 
intercompartmental CL (Q) is 13.5L/h. (16.7% CV). NC analysis confirms the population PK estimate 
for elimination. 
Body weight, eGFR, and albumin were identified as statistically significant covariates on CL with 
estimated factors of 0.06329, 0.0289, and -0.668, respectively. Please also see section “Special 
populations”. 
EMA/308908/2023  
Page 46/122 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Decreasing body weight is associated with a decreasing CL (CL = 1.55 L/h for 35 kg, -24% compared 
to the population typical) and increasing body weight with an increasing CL (CL = 2.75 L/h for 152150 
kg, +35% compared to the population typical).  
Lower baseline serum albumin is associated with an increasing CL (CL = 2.2– 3.4 L/h for 19 to 37 g/L, 
+ 7 to 67% compared to the population typical) and higher baseline serum albumin with a decreasing 
CL (CL = 1.64 L/h for >44 g/L, - 19% compared to the population typical). Please also see section 
“Special populations”. 
Following a single oral dose of 200 mg 14C-pirtobrutinib (study LOXO-BTK-20007), approximately 
37.3% of the total radioactive dose was recovered in faeces and 57.0% in urine. Pirtobrutinib is 
cleared both in faeces and renally with 18.2% and 10% of the radioactive dose. 
The primary clearance pathways involved in pirtobrutinib metabolism are oxidative, hydrolytic, and 
direct glucuronidation. The metabolic clearance of pirtobrutinib occurs predominantly through CYP3A4. 
The formation of the direct glucuronide, metabolite M2 involves mainly UGT1A8 and UGT1A9. 
Pirtobrutinib constitutes the majority (73%) of the drug-related exposure in human plasma, with 3 
minor metabolites, an oxidative ring opening of the pyrazole ring (M1 or LSN3828720), a direct N-
glucuronide (M2 or LSN3829057), and a mono-oxy glucuronide (M4), each accounting for a mean of 
7.8%, 3.3%, and 2.3%, respectively, in healthy participants after a single 200 mg dose.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies  
Dose proportionality was evaluated in Study LOXO-BTK-20017 (T2 tablets) and Study 18001 (T1 and 
T2 tablets) (Study 18001; LOXO-305-DMPK-081). 
After single dose 300 to 900 mg (Study LOXO-BTK-20017), AUCs show dose proportionality, but Cmax 
is sub-proportional but includes 1 in the CI range. 
For Study 18001, after multiple doses 25 to 300 mg, AUC Cmax dose proportionality ratios consistently 
included unity within the 90% confidence interval. 
In Study LOXO-BTK-18001, no signs of risks of time dependency were observed, and accumulation 
ratio was 1.67; compatible with a 18 or 19 hours terminal elimination half-life. 
Special populations  
• 
Impaired renal function 
A dedicated renal impairment study of pirtobrutinib (LOXO-BTK-20013) was performed. Absolute GFR 
(mL/min) has been used to estimate renal function.  In total, eight participants had normal renal 
function, three moderate renal impairment, and five severe renal impairment. Of the latter, results of 
one participant were not analysed due to emesis before the tmax. According to the presented results of 
Study LOXO-BTK-20013 (after reclassification using absolute GFR values), CL in four otherwise healthy 
patients with severe renal impairment was reduced by about 35% leading to about + 65% increase in 
AUC0-inf (11500 vs. 75100 ng*h/mL) and a decrease in Cmax of about -15% (Cmax = 2980 vs 3450 
ng/mL) compared to participants with normal renal function.  
The majority of patients (46%) contributing to the population PK analysis of study LOXO-BTK-18001 
had mild renal impairment. Normal renal function were observed in 32% and moderate renal 
impairment in 21% of the patients. Only four patients (< 1%) had severe renal. Patients on dialysis 
have not been studied. Model-based clearance is expected to vary between about 1.7 to 2.3 L/h from 
EMA/308908/2023

severe renal impaired patients to those with normal renal function (typical population CL = 2.04 L/h 
[37.7% CV]). 
No dose adjustments have been proposed. 
• 
Impaired hepatic function 
A dedicated hepatic impairment study of pirtobrutinib LOXO-BTK-20012) was performed, using both 
Child-Pugh and NCI hepatic function classification. The mean AUC and Cmax of pirtobrutinib were similar 
between subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) and subjects with normal hepatic 
function. In subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) the AUC was 15% lower 
compared to normal hepatic function and the Cmax was similar. In subjects with severe hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh C) the AUC of pirtobrutinib was 21% lower and mean Cmax was 24% lower 
compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. The slight differences observed between subjects 
with hepatic impairment and subjects with normal liver function were attributed to differences in 
pirtobrutinib plasma protein binding. The results were demonstrated to be similar when either Child-
Pugh or NCI liver impairment classification systems were applied to categorise study subjects.  
The effect of hepatic function on the PK of pirtobrutinib was investigated during population PK analysis 
of Study LOXO-BTK-18001 data. The NCI classification was applied. Most patients (80%) included in 
the analysis had normal hepatic function as defined by NCI classification (TBI ≤ ULN and AST ≤ ULN). 
Mild and moderate hepatic impairment were identified for 18% and 2% of the study population, 
respectively. Only one patient had severe hepatic impairment. No statistically significant effect of 
hepatic function on the PK of pirtobrutinib was identified.  
•  Gender 
Among the 595 patients contributing to the population PK analysis of study LOXO-BTK-18001, 201 
(34%) were female and 394 (66%) male. During model development, no statistically significant effect 
of sex on the PK of pirtobrutinib was identified.  
•  Race/ethnicity 
The vast majority of patients (86%) included in the population PK analysis of study LOXO-BTK-18001 
were White/Caucasian and Non-Hispanic (92%). During model development, no statistically significant 
effect of race or ethnicity on the PK of pirtobrutinib was identified.  
•  Body weight 
The median body weight in the PK population of study LOXO-BTK-18001 was 76.6 kg, ranging from 
35.7 to 152.5 kg (mean = 78.3 [22.5% CV]). Body weight was identified as a statistically significant 
covariate on CL and intercompartmental clearance (factor = 0.392) as well as on volume of distribution 
(Vc and Vp; factor = 0.806). Based on population PK modelling and assuming a population typical body 
weight of 70 kg, for patients weighing 35 kg the clearance is expected to decrease down to about 1.55 
L/h (-24%) and the volume of distribution down to about 16.6 L (- 42%). For patients weighing 85 – 
150 kg, the clearance is expected to increase up to about 2.22– 2.75 L/h (+ 9 to 35%) and the volume 
of distribution up to about 34.5 to 53.6 L (+ 19 to 84%). 
•  Age 
Patients  included  in  the  population  PK  analysis  of  study  LOXO-BTK-18001  were  aged  27-95  years 
(median = 68 years, mean = 67.6 years [14.7% CV]). Overall, 242 patients (40.7%) were aged 65 to 
74 years, 119 patients (20%) aged 75 to 84 years, and 20 patients (3.4%) were aged 85 years or older.

During  model  development,  no  statistically  significant  effect  of  age  on  the  PK  of  pirtobrutinib  was 
identified.  
No PK data with pirtobrutinib in paediatrics < 18 years of age are available. 
•  Cancer type 
Of the 595 patients included in the population PK analysis, MCL was diagnosed in 140 patients (23%), 
while the majority of the patients had CLL/SLL (44%, n=263), and 192 patients (32%) had other NHL 
diagnoses. During model development, no statistically significant effect of cancer type on the PK of 
pirtobrutinib was identified. Phase 1 data were not investigated using a population PK modelling 
approach. A comparison of exposure between healthy volunteer and cancer patients was provided. This 
revealed about 15 to 24% lower AUC and 13 to 34% lower Cmax in cancer patients compared to healthy 
volunteers. Apparent clearance appeared similar between both groups (geo. Mean range from 1.68 – 
2.04 L/h across groups / studies). Variability in cancer patients is higher compared to healthy 
volunteers, but this could also partly be attributed to the quality of the data. 
•  Serum albumin 
Patients included in the population PK analysis of study LOXO-BTK-18001 had serum albumin levels of 
19 – 56.5 g/L (median = 41 g/L, mean = 40.1 g/L [13.2% CV]).  Based on population PK modelling, 
patients with a baseline serum albumin level of 19 g/L (lowest observed in study LOXO-BTK-18001) 
are expected to have a CL of about 3.4 L/h (about +67% higher compared to the population typical CL 
of 2.0204 L/h) and a Vc of about 45 L (about +56% higher compared to the population typical Vc of 29 
L). In contrast, patients with a baseline serum albumin level of 56.6 g/L (highest observed in study 
LOXO-BTK-18001) is expected to have a CL of about 1.6964 L/h (about -19% compared to the 
population typical CL of 2.04 L/h) and a Vc of about 2824 L (about -17% compared to the population 
typical Vc of 29 L).  
To further investigate the predicted impact of patient factors, which were identified as influencing the 
PK of pirtobrutinib (body weight, eGFR and serum albumin) simulations based on different values and

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Pirtobrutinib as perpetrator drug 
Pirtobrutinib is a CYP3A4 substrate, a time-dependent inhibitor (TDI), and inducer of CYP3A4. The net 
effect of pirtobrutinib was assessed in vivo in the DDI study LOXO-BTK-20008 conducted with CYP3A4 
substrates (midazolam) showing pirtobrutinib is a mild CYP3A4 inhibitor leading to a 70% midazolam 
exposure increase (AUC 0-inf GMR = 1.70 with 90% CI (1.55, 1.86)) and 58% increase in Cmax after 
single dose of 200 mg pirtobrutinib administration.  
Based on the cocktail study (study LOXO-BTK-20010), pirtobrutinib is a mild inhibitor of CYP2C19. 
Following repeated daily administration of 200 mg pirtobrutinib, omeprazole exposure (AUC0-inf) was 
increased by 56% with GMR test vs reference 1.56 and 90% CI (1.35, 1.80) and Cmax by 49% with 
GMR test vs reference 1.49 and 90% CI (1.31, 1.70). 
Pirtobrutinib inhibition for CYP2C8 substrate was assessed in study LOXO BTK-20016 where 
repaglinide, probe substrate of CYP2C8 was administered with daily 200 mg pirtobrutinib repeatedly. 
Pirtobrutinib was shown to be a moderate CYP2C8 inhibitor which increased by 2.3-fold repaglinide 
exposure (AUC0-inf) with GMR estimated to 2.30 and 90% CI (1.86, 2.84) and 2-fold repaglinide Cmax 
with GMR 1.98 and 90% CI (1.62, 2.43). Caution of use with CYP2C8 substrate recommended in SmPC 
submitted in initial application. 
Pirtobrutinib is a mild inhibitor of P-gp based on the clinical DDI study conducted with digoxin where a 
35% increase in digoxin exposure (AUC0-inf) was observed (GMR = 1.35 with 90% CI (1.29, 1.42)); a 
55% increase in Cmax (GMR = 1.55 with 90% CI 1.35, 1.78)), and a 12% decreased in digoxin renal 
clearance (GMR = 0.878 with 90% CI (0.841, 0.917)) were observed.  
Pirtobrutinib inhibition of BCRP substrates at clinically relevant concentrations in vivo could not be 
excluded based on in vitro study. A Drug Interaction Study to Investigate the Effect of Single and

Multiple Doses of Pirtobrutinib on the Pharmacokinetics of Rosuvastatin in Healthy Participants (Study 
J2N-MC-JZNW) was conducted. The results show that pirtobrutinib increased AUC and Cmax of 
rosuvastatin (a sensitive BCRP substrate) by 140% (GMR 2.40 and 90% CI: 2.21, 2.62) and 146% 
(GMR 2.46 and 90% CI: 2.20, 2.75), respectively. Pirtobrutinib is considered a moderate breast cancer 
resistant protein (BCRP) inhibitor. 
Based on in vitro studies, clinical inhibition of UGT1A1 by pirtobrutinib cannot be excluded at clinically 
relevant concentrations.  
Pirtobrutinib as victim drug 
Pirtobrutinib was shown to be metabolised by CYP3A4 and glucuronidation, being substrate of UGT1A8 
and UGT1A9. 
Pirtobrutinib exposure is increased mildly when co-administered with itraconazole, a strong CYP3A4 
inhibitor,  with a 49% pirtobrutinib exposure (AUC0-inf) increase with GMR test vs reference of 1.49 
and 90% CI of (1.40, 1.58) and no change in Cmax with GMR test vs reference of 1.04 and 90% CI of 
(0.951, 1.13). 
Following 200 mg administration with repeated 600 mg rifampicin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, led to 
71% decrease in pirtobrutinib exposure (AUC0-inf) with GMR test vs reference of 0.293 and 90% CI of 
(0.271, 0.316), and a decrease in Cmax by 42% with GMR test vs reference of 0.576 and 90% CI of 
(0.537, 0.617). 
No effect on pirtobrutinib PK was observed following co-administration of a single 40 mg dose of 
omeprazole, with a single dose of 200 mg pirtobrutinib under fasting conditions. 
2.5.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics  
Mechanism of action 
Pirtobrutinib is a small molecule reversible, noncovalent inhibitor of BTK. 
BTK is a signalling protein of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) and cytokine receptor pathways. In B-
cells,  BTK  signalling  results  in  activation  of  pathways  necessary  for  B-cell  proliferation,  trafficking, 
chemotaxis, and adhesion. Pirtobrutinib binds to wild type BTK as well as BTK harbouring C481 mutations 
leading to inhibition of BTK kinase activity.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
For primary pharmacodynamic studies please refer to the non-clinical section of this report. 
Secondary pharmacology 
A thorough QT study was conducted to detect any effect of pirtobrutinib on QT interval. The design of 
the study was a cross over study, controlled versus placebo and a positive control (moxifloxacin) at the 
appropriate dose. The chosen supratherapeutic dose of 900 mg for pirtobrutinib achieved a mean Cmax 
at least twice the mean Cmax observed with the intended dose of 200 mg.  
EMA/308908/2023  
Page 52/122 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Results of this study showed that ΔΔQTcF varied within 1.9 msec (at 0.75 hour postdose) to 2.6 msec 
(at 6 hours postdose), with all upper bounds of the 90% CI of the estimated effect below 5.3 msec and 
therefore under 10 ms which is considered the threshold for a negative thorough QT/QTc study. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect  
Data from the pivotal Phase 1/2 study LOXO-BTK-18001 (data cut-off date 31 January 2022) were 
used for population E-R analysis for efficacy (Overall response rate [ORR]) and safety (TEAEs: Grade 
≥3 anaemia, neutropenia, and infections/infestations, and hypertension). 
The base models consisted of a logistic regression model which estimated the incidence of the endpoint 
for the entire study population independent of drug exposure. Afterwards, the relationship between 
predicted pirtobrutinib concentration and efficacy (Figure 9 and Table 16) and safety endpoint 
(Figure 10) was evaluated. Due to the use of intra-patient dose escalation in Study LOXO-BTK-18001, 
Cavg of pirtobrutinib from the start of treatment up to the time of event was tested. In addition, for 
safety, Cmax of pirtobrutinib from the start of treatment up to the time of event, was investigated. The 
relationship between pirtobrutinib concentration and the safety or efficacy endpoint was tested using 
linear, log-linear, and Emax models. A statistical significance of Δ OFV = 3.841 points for 1 degree of 
freedom, p<0.05 was assumed. 
The relationship between Cavg up to the time of the best overall response (BOR) and ORR was not 
statistically significant. No statistically significant covariates were identified. 
No statistically significant relationship was identified between incidence of TEAE and Cavg or Cmax. No 
patient factors were identified as predictors of increased risk of Grade ≥3 anaemia, neutropenia, or 
infection/infestation. A statistically significant relationship between cancer type and incidence of any 
grade hypertension was identified. The likelihood of experiencing hypertension was 2.74-fold higher in 
patients with CLL/SLL compared to MCL or other NHL. Considering that the duration of treatment for 
CLL/SLL was significantly longer than for MCL patients, it is possible that this relationship was due to 
these differences in treatment duration and reduced follow-up time for MCL patients.  
Overall, no statistically significant relationship between pirtobrutinib exposure and investigated efficacy 
and safety measures were suggested over the dose range of 25 to 300 mg QD. 
E-R analyses evaluating the range of safe and efficacious exposures in MCL patients suggested a wide 
therapeutic window for pirtobrutinib with mean average concentrations of Cavg,ss = 399 ng/mL (28% 
CV) to 6370 ng/mL (51% CV) for 25 mg and 300 mg, respectively. For the proposed 200 mg QD 
dosing, a model-predicted Cavg,ss of 3800 ng/mL (41% CV) is expected.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology  
Two formulations T1 and T2 were used in the clinical development programme. According to the 
presented overview, the to-be-marketed formulation T2 was tested as 100 mg strength only and the 
50 mg tablet was not administered. No bioequivalence study was presented, however the waiver for a 
BE study between the tablets was well justified and acceptable. 
A population PK model was developed using data from adult cancer patients participating in the pivotal 
Phase 1/2 study BTK-LOXO-18001. Results reveal an overall acceptable descriptive and predictive 
performance of the model.  
The absolute bioavailability of pirtobrutinib after a single oral 200 mg dose is 85.5% in healthy 
subjects. The median time to reach peak plasma concentration (tmax) is approximately 2 hours in both 
cancer patients and healthy subjects. There is no pH dependency for absorption.

A high-fat, high-calorie meal administered to healthy subjects decreased the Cmax of pirtobrutinib by 
23% and delayed tmax by 1 hour. There was no effect on pirtobrutinib AUC. Pirtobrutinib can be taken 
with or without food. 
The mean apparent central volume of distribution of pirtobrutinib is 29.0 L in cancer patients. The 
plasma protein binding is 96% and was independent of concentration between 0.5 and 50 μM. In 
plasma from healthy subjects and subjects with severe renal impairment the protein binding was 96%. 
Mean blood-to-plasma ratio is 0.79. 
Hepatic metabolism is the main route of clearance for pirtobrutinib. Pirtobrutinib is metabolised to 
several inactive metabolites by CYP3A4, UGT1A8 and UGT1A9. There was no clinically meaningful 
impact of CYP3A modulation on pirtobrutinib exposures. 
The mean apparent clearance of pirtobrutinib is 2.04 L/h with an effective half-life of approximately 19 
hours. Following a single radio-labelled dose of pirtobrutinib 200 mg to healthy subjects, 37% of the 
dose was recovered in faeces (18% unchanged) and 57% in urine (10% unchanged). 
In vitro and in vivo studies investigating the efficacy of pirtobrutinib on WT and mutated BTK were 
submitted. 
Pirtobrutinib was shown to be able to inhibit in vitro WT BTK and BTK C481S with IC50 values of 3.15 
nM and 1.42 nM respectively. Lineweaver-Burk analysis demonstrated that pirtobrutinib is a 
competitive inhibitor with respect to ATP in BTK and BTK C481, these studies also showed that M1 
metabolite has no in vitro activity. Pirtobrutinib activity was also maintained in a number of BTK C481 
resistance mutants transiently expressed in Human Embryonic Kidney cells and in human DLBCL TMD8 
and human MCL REC-1 cell lines. 
In vivo, pirtobrutinib was assessed in Human B-cell Lymphoma Xenograft Models in 
Immunocompromised Mice, In the REC 1 MCL xenograft model, pirtobrutinib demonstrated significant 
tumour growth inhibition of 80% and 84% at 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg BID, respectively, and tumour 
regression of -11% in the 50 mg/kg BID group. 
The relationship between concentration and effect in patients with MCL was evaluated using dose-
ranging data from the Phase 1/2 study, Study 18001. Overall, no statistically significant relationship 
between pirtobrutinib exposure and investigated efficacy and safety measures were suggested over the 
dose range of 25 to 300 mg QD. 
For efficacy, according to the applicant, there was no meaningful relationship between pirtobrutinib 
exposure and efficacy (ORR) within the range of exposures achieved, however, considering the intra 
patient dose escalation, no conclusion could be made on other dose regimens. It should be noted that 
at doses ≥100 mg QD, ≥79% of patients are predicted to achieve concentrations of pirtobrutinib that 
exceed 90% inhibition of BTK across the entire dosing interval, which cannot be considered sufficient 
for a reduce dose regiment.  
Considering safety, no apparent relationship exists between pirtobrutinib exposure and key safety 
endpoints. 
The effect of a single 900 mg dose of pirtobrutinib on the corrected QT (QTc) interval was evaluated in 
a study with placebo and positive controls in 30 healthy subjects. The selected dose is equivalent to 
approximately 2 times higher than the concentrations achieved at steady state at the recommended 
dosage of 200 mg once daily. Pirtobrutinib had no clinically meaningful effect on the change in QT 
corrected for heart rate using Fridericia’s formula (QTcF) interval (i.e., > 10 ms) and there was no 
relationship between pirtobrutinib exposure and change in QTc interval.

Special populations 
Based on the population PK analysis, body weight, renal function (eGFR), and albumin were found to 
statistically affect the PK of pirtobrutinib. Simulations including the minimum and maximum values of 
those parameters as observed in Study 18001 were provided. The degree of overlap between profiles 
suggested a minimal impact of these patient factors especially considering the degree of natural PK 
variability in the patient population. For example, a patient with low body weight would be predicted to 
have higher pirtobrutinib PK exposures but due to other factors affecting PK variability, may indeed 
have a lower exposure than would be predicted based on body weight alone. As these factors alone are 
unlikely to result in meaningful changes to pirtobrutinib PK no dose adjustments are recommended. 
•  Renal impairment 
There  were  no  clinically  significant  differences  in  the  PK  of  pirtobrutinib  for  any  degree  of  renal 
impairment (mild, moderate and severe). 
In a population PK analysis of cancer patients, patients with mild (eGFR 60 to < 90 ml/min) or 
moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to < 60 ml/min), pirtobrutinib clearance was 16% to 27% lower 
compared to clearance in patients with normal renal function, resulting in expected exposure of AUC = 
94 100 ng*h/mL and Cmax = 6 680 ng/mL in patients with mild renal impairment (16-19% higher 
compared to patients with normal renal function) and AUC = 108 000 ng*h/mL and Cmax = 7 360 
ng/mL in patients with moderate renal impairment (28 to 36% higher compared to patients with 
normal renal function). 
In a clinical pharmacology study of otherwise healthy volunteers, apparent clearance was 35% lower in 
four participants with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to < 30 ml/min) compared to eight 
participants with normal renal function (eGFR ≥ 90 ml/min), resulting in exposures of AUC0-inf = 115 
000 ng*h/mL and Cmax = 2 980 ng/mL (62% higher and 7% lower, respectively, compared to normal 
renal function). 
Patients with end-stage renal disease receiving dialysis were not studied. 
•  Hepatic impairment 
There were no clinically significant differences in the PK of pirtobrutinib for any degree of hepatic 
impairment (by Child-Pugh A, B, and C or any total bilirubin and any AST). In a dedicated hepatic 
impairment study mean AUC and Cmax of pirtobrutinib were similar between subjects with mild 
hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) and subjects with normal hepatic function. In subjects with 
moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) the AUC was 15% lower compared to normal hepatic 
function and the Cmax was similar. In subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) the AUC 
of pirtobrutinib was 21% lower and mean Cmax was 24% lower compared to subjects with normal 
hepatic function. The fraction unbound (fu) for pirtobrutinib in subjects generally increased as the 
severity of hepatic impairment increased. Therefore, after correcting pirtobrutinib PK exposure 
parameters with fu, there was no clinically significant difference observed in the unbound pirtobrutinib 
PK exposure parameters (AUCu and Cmax,u) between subjects with any degree of hepatic impairment 
and normal hepatic function. 
• 
Paediatric population 
No pharmacokinetic studies were performed with pirtobrutinib in patients under 18 years of age. 
• 
Pregnancy and lactation 
There  are  no  data  from  the  use  of  pirtobrutinib  in  pregnant  women.  Studies  in  animals  have  shown 
reproductive toxicity and therefore pirtobrutinib should not be used during pregnancy. 
EMA/308908/2023  
Page 57/122 
 
 
  
 
 
It  is unknown  whether  pirtobrutinib  is  excreted in human  milk.  A  risk  to  the suckling  child  cannot  be 
excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with pirtobrutinib and for one week 
after the last dose of pirtobrutinib. 
There are no data on the effect of pirtobrutinib on human fertility. 
Interaction with other medicinal products 
Pirtobrutinib is primarily metabolised by CYP3A4, UGT1A8, and UGT1A9. 
•  CYP3A inhibitors 
In a clinical study, itraconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased the AUC of pirtobrutinib by 48% 
and  did  not  change  Cmax  of  pirtobrutinib.  This  increase  in  pirtobrutinib  exposure  is  not  clinically 
meaningful. Therefore, no dose adjustment of Jaypirca is necessary with CYP3A inhibitors. 
•  CYP3A inducers 
In a clinical study, rifampicin, a strong CYP3A inducer, decreased the AUC and Cmax of pirtobrutinib by 
71%  and  42%,  respectively.  Though  this  decrease  in  pirtobrutinib  exposure  is  not  expected  to  be 
clinically  meaningful,  if  possible  avoid  strong  CYP3A  inducers  (e.g.  rifampicin,  carbamazepine, 
phenytoin). 
• 
Proton pump inhibitors 
No clinically significant differences in pirtobrutinib pharmacokinetics were observed when administered 
concomitantly with omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor. 
•  CYP2C8 substrates 
Pirtobrutinib is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C8. Pirtobrutinib increased the AUC and Cmax of repaglinide 
(a substrate of CYP2C8) by 130% and 98%, respectively. Therefore, since pirtobrutinib can increase the 
plasma  concentrations  of  CYP2C8  substrates,  caution  is  advised  when  co-administering  with  CYP2C8 
substrates (e.g. repaglinide, dasabuvir, selexipag, rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, and montelukast). 
•  BCRP substrates 
Pirtobrutinib is a moderate inhibitor of BCRP. Pirtobrutinib increased the AUC and Cmax of rosuvastatin 
(a  BCRP  substrate)  by  140%  and  146%,  respectively.  Therefore,  since  pirtobrutinib  can  increase  the 
plasma concentrations of BCRP substrates, caution is advised when co-administering BCRP substrates 
(e.g. rosuvastatin). If co-administration with narrow therapeutic index BCRP substrates (e.g. high dose 
methotrexate, mitoxantrone) cannot be avoided, close clinical monitoring should be considered.  
• 
P-gp substrates 
Pirtobrutinib is a weak inhibitor of P-gp. Pirtobrutinib increased the AUC and Cmax of digoxin (a P-gp 
substrate)  by  35%  and  55%,  respectively.  Therefore,  pirtobrutinib  can  increase  the  plasma 
concentrations of P-gp substrates. If co-administration with narrow therapeutic index P-gp substrates 
(e.g dabigatran etexilate and digoxin) cannot be avoided, close clinical monitoring should be considered. 
•  CYP2C19 substrates 
Pirtobrutinib is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C19. Pirtobrutinib increased the AUC and Cmax of omeprazole (a 
CYP2C19  substrate)  by  56%  and  49%,  respectively.  Therefore,  pirtobrutinib  can  increase  the  plasma 
concentrations  of  CYP2C19  substrates.  If  co-administration  with  narrow  therapeutic  index  CYP2C19 
substrates (e.g phenobarbital and mephenytoin) cannot be avoided, close clinical monitoring should be 
considered. 
EMA/308908/2023  
Page 58/122 
 
 
  
 
 
•  CYP3A substrates 
Pirtobrutinib  is  a  weak  inhibitor  of  CYP3A.  Pirtobrutinib  increased  the  AUC  and  Cmax  of  orally 
administered midazolam (sensitive CYP3A substrate) by 70% and 58%, respectively. Pirtobrutinib did 
not  have  a  clinically  meaningful  effect  on  the  exposure  of  intravenously  administered  midazolam. 
Therefore, pirtobrutinib can increase the plasma concentrations of CYP3A substrates. If co-administration 
with  narrow  therapeutic  index  CYP3A  substrates  (e.g  alfentanil,  midazolam,  tacrolimus)  cannot  be 
avoided, close clinical monitoring should be considered. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology  
The applicant has adequately characterised the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of 
pirtobrutinib which therefore can be recommended for marketing authorisation. 
2.5.5.  Clinical efficacy  
2.5.5.1.  Dose response study  
The RP2D of 200 mg QD was established at the end of the Phase 1 portion of Study 18001 based on 
the PK, safety, and antitumor activity data available at the time. 
By comparing the simulated population PK profiles of each administered dose of pirtobrutinib to the 
protein binding-adjusted IC50 for BTK in vitro, it was demonstrated that at doses ≥100 mg QD, 79% 
of patients are predicted to achieve concentrations of pirtobrutinib which exceed 90% inhibition of BTK 
across the entire dosing interval. At the RP2D of 200 mg QD, 96% of patients are predicted to exceed 
90% inhibition of BTK, and 63% of patients are predicted to achieve concentrations which exceed 96% 
inhibition of BTK across the entire dosing interval.

•  Sample size 
Phase 1 – Dose Escalation and Phase 1b-Dose Combinations  
During the dose escalation phase, approximately 25 patients were estimated to be needed to define 
the MTD/RP2D of pirtobrutinib. Up to 150 additional patients were to be enrolled across all dose 
cohorts previously declared safe by the SRC to further investigate the tolerability, PK, and biological 
activity of pirtobrutinib. 
Phase 1b was to evaluate safety of pirtobrutinib in combination with other defined drugs. It was 
estimated that a minimum of 3 and up to 6 patients per treatment arm would be needed to determine 
safety of each specified combination, but the total number of patients enrolled was dependent on the 
observed safety profile. Up to 30 additional patients may be enrolled to each of the Phase 1b treatment 
arms at the defined dosing combinations once declared safe by the SRC to further investigate the 
tolerability, PK, and biological activity of pirtobrutinib in combination. This number of patients was 
considered sufficient to further assess preliminary safety and efficacy. It has 95% probability of 
identifying AEs occurring in > 10% of patients. 
Phase 2 – Dose Expansion 
The description below focuses on Cohorts 1 and 7, as they include MCL patients relevant to the present 
application.  
For Cohort 1 (Non-blastoid MCL patients treated with a prior BTK inhibitor-containing regimen), a true 
ORR of ≥ 40% was hypothesised when pirtobrutinib was administered for these patients. A sample size 
of 65 patients was estimated to provide 92% statistical power to achieve a lower boundary of a two-
sided 95% exact binomial CI about the estimated ORR that exceeds 20%. The sample size in the 
primary analysis set (PAS) was increased to N = 90 due to FDA feedback.  
Ruling out a lower limit of 20% for ORR was considered clinically meaningful for MCL patients who 
have failed prior therapy was considered clinically meaningful for patients with MCL who have 
discontinued prior BTK inhibitor therapy, as ORRs of 20% to 30% were reported in clinical studies 
testing agents given as monotherapy in BTK inhibitor-naïve advanced MCL (temsirolimus, 22% [Hess 
et al. 2009]; bortezomib, 31% [Velcade USPI], lenalidomide, 28% [Goy et al. 2015]). There are no 
published data on the activity of these agents in a BTK-pretreated MCL population, which is a more 
treatment refractory population with a high unmet need. Under the primary analysis, the lower limit of 
the 95% CI was to exceed 20% when the estimated ORR is 32% or greater (Clopper-Pearson method). 
Cohort 7 enrolled patients with B-cell neoplasms not otherwise specified in Cohorts 1 through 6, as 
well as those with Richter’s transformation, patients with CNS metastasis, or patients with non-
measurable disease regardless of underlying diagnosis. Up to 20 patients for any specific diagnosis as 
defined by World Health Organization Classification (e.g., non-GCB DLBCL) could be enrolled into 
Cohort 7. Enrolment was to be stopped on a diagnosis-specific basis if the response rate < 20% out of 
approximately 20 patients in that given diagnosis. The decision to further investigate beyond 20 
patients for any specific diagnosis was based on comprehensive evaluation of the risk-benefit profile.  
Patients enrolled in LOXO-BTK-18001 study Phase 1 who meet the eligibility criteria for the Phase 2 
cohort PAS may be included in the efficacy analysis for that cohort and counted into the cohort sample 
size.

better per Lugano Classification of Response, and minor response or better per IWWM) was to be 
performed for each cohort of the Phase 2 and Phase 1b portions. The futility analysis would be 
EMA/308908/2023  
Page 65/122 
 
 
  
 
 
performed after the first 20 patients were enrolled in each cohort and had the opportunity to be 
followed until the second disease assessment. The purpose of the futility assessment was to safeguard 
future patients from exposure to unequivocally inferior treatment. Enrolment was to be stopped if the 
overall response rate out of the first 20 efficacy evaluable patients was less than the given rate (Table 
17). Otherwise, the enrolment was to proceed without interruption. 
Table 17. Stopping Boundaries for Efficacy Monitoring in Patients Enrolled in Phase 2 and 
Phase 1b  
•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
This is an open label study. 
•  Statistical methods 
Two statistical analysis plans (SAP) have been provided by the applicant: an interim clinical study 
report (CSR) SAP (v2.0, 14 January 2022) and a Summary of Clinical Efficacy (CSE) SAP (v2.0, 24 
January 2022). When definitions differ between SAPs, both SAPs specifications are included in the 
sections below. 
Primary endpoint – Overall Response Rate (ORR) 
The primary analysis was based on the time point responses recorded by the IRC.  
BOR was derived from the time point responses. BOR was defined as the best response designation for 
each patient that was recorded between the date of the first dose of pirtobrutinib and the date of 
documented PD per Lugano criteria or the date of subsequent anti-cancer therapy, whichever was 
earlier. 
ORR and the corresponding 95% two-sided CI were calculated. ORR was estimated based on the 
proportion of patients with BOR of CR or PR in efficacy evaluable patients. Two-sided 95% CI were 
calculated using the exact binomial distribution. 
EMA/308908/2023  
Page 66/122 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
The efficacy of pirtobrutinib in the PAS was to be demonstrated if the lower limit of the two-sided 95% 
CI exceeded 20%. 
Secondary endpoints 
Duration of Response (DOR) 
DOR was calculated for patients who achieved a response of CR or PR as a BOR. DOR was defined as 
the number of months from the start date of the first documented response to the earlier of the 
documentation of PD or death from any cause. Patients who are alive and without documented PD as 
of the data analysis cut-off date were censored.  
The number and percentage of patients were tabulated based on the patient’s response duration 
(patient’s follow up time on disease assessment post the initial response): < 6 months, 6 to < 9 
months, 9 to < 12 months, 12 to < 18 months, ≥ 18 months. 
DOR was summarised descriptively using the Kaplan-Meier method. The Kaplan-Meier estimate with 
95% CI calculated using Brookmeyer and Crowley method were provided for DOR time quartiles. The 
event-free rate with 95% CI using Greenwood’s formula was provided for selected timepoints (e.g., 6, 
9, 12, and 18 months.) The reason for censoring was summarised. Median follow-up for responders 
was estimated according to the Kaplan-Meier estimate of potential follow-up (Schemper and Smith 
1996). 
Time to Response 
TTR was defined as the number of months elapsed between the date of the first dose of pirtobrutinib 
and the first documentation of overall response (CR or PR, whichever occurs earlier).  
TTR was summarised descriptively by calculating the median, interquartile range, and minimum and 
maximum values. The number and percentage of patients with TTR by the following time points, 
measured relative to the date of the first dose of pirtobrutinib, were tabulated: < 2 months, 2 to < 4 
months, 4 to < 6 months, ≥ 6 months. 
Time to Best Response 
TTBR was defined as the number of months elapsed between the date of the first dose of pirtobrutinib 
and the first documentation of CR (if patient’s BOR is CR) or PR (if patient’s BOR is PR).  
TTBR was summarised descriptively in the same manner as TTR. 
Progression-free Survival 
PFS was defined as the number of months from the date of the first dose of pirtobrutinib to the earlier 
of the documentation of PD or death from any cause. Patients who were alive and without documented 
PD as of the data analysis cut-off date were censored. 
Unless specified otherwise, the analysis methods described for DOR were used for PFS.

IRC and investigator assessments 
IRC assessments served as the principal data source for BOR, DOR, TTR/TTBR, and PFS. Supplemental 
analyses based on Investigator assessments were provided. 
Sensitivity analysis 
To address FDA and EMA’s questions on heterogeneity in patients enrolled between Phase 1 and Phase 
2 portion of the study, key demographics and baseline characteristics were summarised by Phase 1 and 
Phase 2.  
Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess MCL patients enrolled in the Phase 2 portion of the study 
who  meet  PAS  criteria  addressing  scientific  advice  received  from  the  EMA.  This  subset  of  patients  is 
referred to as the Phase 2 Analysis Set.

•  Conduct of the study 
Changes to planned analyses 
The study protocol was amended a number of times (from version 1.0 on 27 August 2018 to version 
10.0 on 21 January 2022) before the data cut-off of 31st January 2022. During the procedure the 
applicant provided updated data with cut-off date of 29 July 2022.  
The most significant amendments to the statistical section were made as part of Version 6.0 (24 June 
2020, in order to address necessary updates to the Phase 2 design for LOXO-305 monotherapy which 
reflected the applicant’s intent of the study to support registration. The Phase 2 cohorts were redefined 
to be disease specific rather than by BTK mutational status. As a result, analysis populations and 
sample size considerations were modified. In addition, the RP2D was determined to be 200 mg QD. 
Both SAPs have also been revised once each. For the SCE SAP this was to change the data cut-off date 
and to increase the sample size of the primary analysis set from 65 to 90 based on FDA feedback.  
were summarised by the applicant in the tables below. 
In the Efficacy Analysis Set (EAS) as defined in the CSR SAP (see below, section: Numbers analysed), 
major protocol deviations were reported for 7 (5.7%) patients in Cohort 1. These were due to errors 
with the study procedures (3 patients), investigational product (2 patients), and safety 
reporting/follow-up (2 patients). A major protocol deviation due to errors with study assessment was 
reported for 1 patient with MCL in Cohort 7 
•  Baseline data

The Efficacy Analysis Set (EAS) included all MCL and CLL/SLL patients enrolled in the Phase 1 and 
Phase 2 portions of the study who met the following criteria: 
• Treated with prior BTK inhibitor-containing regimen 
• Received 1 or more doses of pirtobrutinib 
The efficacy analysis was conducted on the EAS by Phase 2 cohort. Patients treated during Phase 1 
dose escalation and expansion (backfill) who also met the disease definitions and pre-treatment 
criteria for one of the Phase 2 disease-defined cohorts could be considered as part of the efficacy 
evaluable patients for that Phase 2 cohort.

Phase 2 Sensitivity Analyses 
The PAS included patients enrolled across Phase 1 and Phase 2 portions of Study 18001, including 56 
patients who were treated in the Phase 2 portion and referred to as the Phase 2 Analysis Set. 
Sensitivity analyses , including overall response rates (Table 31), duration of responses (Table 32) and 
overall  survival  were  conducted  to  evaluate  potential  concerns  of  heterogeneity  caused  by  pooling  of 
Phase 1 and Phase 2 patients, primarily in terms of starting dose.

•  Summary of main efficacy results 
The following tables summarise the efficacy results from the main studies supporting the present 
application. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as 
well as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections). 
Table 36. Summary of efficacy for trial LOXO-BTK-18001  
Title: A Phase 1/2 Study of Oral LOXO-305 in Patients with Previously Treated Chronic Lymphocytic 
Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (CLL/SLL) or Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) 
Study identifier 
Protocol No.: LOXO-BTK-18001 (Study 18001; BRUIN) 
EudraCT No.: 2018-003340-24 
Design 
Open-label, multicentre study of oral pirtobrutinib to evaluate safety and efficacy as 
monotherapy and as part of combination therapy in patients with CLL/SLL and NHL who 
have failed or are intolerant to standard of care. This study includes monotherapy and 
combination treatment parts. The monotherapy part includes Phase 1 dose escalation and 
dose expansion, as well as a Phase 2 component. 
Duration of main phase: 
The study is ongoing. Patients are to be treated 
until there is an evidence of PD, unacceptable 
toxicity, or other reasons for treatment 
discontinuation as outlined in the protocol.

Hypothesis  
For Patients with MCL Previously Treated with a BTK Inhibitor 
• 
• 
• 
• 
A true ORR of ≥40% is hypothesised when pirtobrutinib is administered to 
patients with MCL who have received a prior BTK inhibitor. 
A sample size of 65 patients is estimated to provide approximately 92% statistical 
power to achieve a lower boundary of a 2-sided 95% exact binomial CI about the 
estimated ORR that exceeds 20%. 
Ruling out a lower limit of 20% for ORR is considered clinically meaningful for 
patients with MCL who have discontinued prior BTK inhibitor therapy. 
A cutoff date of 31 January 2022 was chosen, with the sample size in the PAS of 
90 patients, to ensure that the vast majority of responders in the PAS will have at 
least 9 months of follow-up from the onset of response.  
Treatments 
groups 
Pirtobrutinib 
Phase 1 dose escalation: 25 mg QD to 300 mg QD 
pirtobrutinib 
Phase 2 (Cohorts 1 to 7): 200 mg QD pirtobrutinib 
Eligibility criteria, methods for disease assessment, 
and response criteria were consistent across Phase 
1 and Phase 2. The PAS, the primary population to 
support the proposed MCL indication, pools patients 
across Phase 1 and Phase 2 and includes the first 
90 patients with MCL enrolled and treated with 
pirtobrutinib monotherapy from either Phase 1 or 
Phase 2, irrespective of pirtobrutinib starting dose, 
that have received a prior BTK inhibitor-containing 
regimen and had no known central nervous system 
involvement, and with at least 1 site of 
radiographically assessable disease as determined 
by investigator. 
As a sensitivity analysis, a Phase 2 analysis set was 
generated; this analysis set has the same criteria 
as the PAS; however, only Phase 2 patients were 
included. 
ORR according to IRC assessment is defined based 
on the Lugano Treatment Response Criteria. ORR 
will be estimated as the proportion of patients with 
BOR of CR or PR.  
BOR is defined as the best response designation for 
each patient that is recorded between the date of 
the first dose of pirtobrutinib and the earliest of 
• 
• 
• 
the date of documented PD per the 
Lugano Treatment Response Criteria 
the date of subsequent anticancer 
therapy, or 
the data cutoff date.

DOR will be calculated for patients who achieve a 
response of CR or PR as a BOR. DOR is defined as 
the number of months from the start date of the 
first documented response to the earlier of either 
the documentation of PD or death from any cause. 
Patients who are alive and without documented PD 
as of the data analysis cutoff date will be censored. 
TTR is defined as the number of months elapsed 
between the date of the first dose of pirtobrutinib 
and the first documentation of overall response (CR 
or PR, whichever occurs earlier). 
TTBR is defined as the number of months elapsed 
between the date of the first dose of pirtobrutinib 
and the first documentation of CR (if patient’s BOR 
is CR) or PR (if patient’s BOR is PR). 
PFS is defined as the number of months from the 
date of the first dose of pirtobrutinib to the earlier 
of either documentation of PD or death from any 
cause. Patients who are alive and without 
documented PD as of the data analysis cutoff date 
will be censored. 
OS is defined as the number of months from the 
date of the first dose of pirtobrutinib to the date of 
death from any cause. Patients who are alive or

2.5.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The main study in support of this Conditional Marketing Authorisation (CMA) application is a phase 1/2 
single arm, open-label study (LOXO-BTK-18001). In the cohorts of interest for the initially claimed 
indication of pirtobrutinib as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with mantle cell 
lymphoma (MCL) who have been previously treated with a Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, 
subjects had received a median number of 3 prior lines of systemic therapy, with 1 prior BTKi. 
Discontinuation from previous BTKi was in most cases (81.1%) due to disease progression. 
Consequently, the CHMP requested, and the applicant accepted that the indication should be amended 
to better reflect the patient population of the pivotal study to treatment of adult patients with relapsed 
or refractory MCL who have been previously treated with a BTKi.  
This single arm design of the study design leads to uncertainties due to the absence of any comparator 
and is further compounded from the relatively small sample size and the limited follow-up of the study. 
However, in the context of a CMA and given the rarity of the disease, the poor prognosis of the patient 
population and the lack of alternative treatments in this clinical setting the CHMP considered that these 
limitations would not preclude a conditional marketing authorisation. 
Two SAPs were developed in parallel by the applicant: an interim CSR SAP and a SCE SAP which 
hinders interpretation of data since the 2 SAPs had different sample size considerations and analysis 
populations.  
The interim CSR SAP referred to a sample size of 65 patients for Cohort 1 alone (Non-blastoid MCL BTK 
treated patients) with the Efficacy Analysis Set (EAS) including all MCL and CLL/SLL patients enrolled in 
the Phase 1 and Phase 2 portions of the study and who were treated with prior BTK inhibitor-
containing regimen and received at least 1 dose of pirtobrutinib. According to this SAP all results were 
to be displayed by cohort (i.e. patients from Cohort 1 are analysed separately from other MCL patients 
from Cohort 7). 
On the other hand, the SCE SAP mentioned 65 patients in the context of a pooling based on Cohort 1 
and Cohort 7 (all MCL BTK treated patients). The decision to increase the SCE primary analysis set to 
the first 90 patients was described only in the SCE SAP.  
Finally, the CSR SAP (and the study protocol) did not include a definition of subgroup analysis, as this 
was only defined during the development of the original SCE SAP Version 1.0 (20 April 2021).  
Important modifications were made to the protocol which impacted the study design and the statistical 
approach. Phase 2 cohorts were redefined with protocol v6.0 to be disease specific rather than 
stratified by BTK mutational status. This amendment was made to support registration. Even though, 
limited impact on efficacy analysis could be expected from this change, results by BTK mutational 
status which would have been able to confirm the in vitro activity on C481 mutation were not provided. 
It was also noted that the first version of each SAP was finalised when the study had already been 
ongoing for more than 2 years. Both SAPs were revised just before the interim analysis cut-off date. 
The cut-off date itself was modified from 16 July 2021 to 31 January 2022 in the revised version of the 
SCE SAP dated 13 January 2022. That means the cut-off was changed 6 months after the previously 
defined cut-off date had been reached, and only two weeks before the newly defined date. There were 
no clear predefined criteria for the determination of the cut-off date. Of note, the cut-off date appears 
EMA/308908/2023  
Page 93/122 
 
 
  
 
 
to be left undefined in the interim CSR SAP but the same date was selected as for the SCE (31 January 
2022).  
As both provided SAPs are relevant to the MCL application it is not possible to determine on what basis 
one should be considered primary and the other as supportive. This creates a multiplicity issue, which 
is of concern, particularly as no multiplicity adjustment had been planned in either SAP.  The late 
changes in planned analyses in conjunction with the single arm nature of the study also raise bias 
concerns for the reported results.  
The CHMP noted the consistency in the results that have been performed across the various analysis 
populations and cut-off dates which provides some reassurance on the robustness of ORR results in the 
MCL population, despite the methodological limitations. 
Due to the potential for additional heterogeneity, the CHMP had previously warned against pooling 
patients from Phase 1 who fulfil eligibility criteria with patients from Phase 2 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/470869/2020). This advice was not followed. Nevertheless, the applicant has 
provided sensitivity analyses based on the subset of patients from Phase 2 only (Phase 2 analysis set), 
i.e. excluding patients from Phase 1, which did not show important differences between the PAS and 
the Phase 2 analysis set.  
If the applicant were to proceed with pooling, CHMP advised that the PAS should include only patients 
treated at the proposed 200mg QD dose. This recommendation was not followed either. The applicant 
provided additional demographic, baseline characteristics and primary / secondary efficacy results for 
the subset of patients treated at 200 mg QD dose in the PAS. As could be expected due to the large 
overlap between the full PAS population and its 200 mg QD subset, baseline characteristics and 
efficacy results were generally similar between the 200 mg QD PAS subset and the full MCL PAS and 
using both cut-off dates. 
It was also noted that the PFS censoring rules were not in line with the Appendix 1 to the guideline on 
the evaluation of anticancer medicinal products in man (EMA/CHMP/27994/2008/Rev.1). As requested, 
the applicant provided sensitivity PFS and DoR analyses more in line with the intent-to-treat principle 
(as per EMA guideline). The PFS sensitivity analysis results appear consistent with the main PFS 
analysis. It is noted that DoR rates beyond 12 months are numerically lower with the sensitivity 
analysis compared with the original analysis results, and similarly the median DoR is lower in the 
sensitivity results (16.10 months) in comparison with the original results (21.59 months). 
Nevertheless, it is difficult to draw any meaningful interpretation from these observed differences, 
especially as the censoring rate is high and the median follow-up is only around 12 months.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses  
Several analysis groups have been presented and analysed by the applicant. In this report, PAS will be 
considered as the main assessment population, as this is closer to the claimed indication and also 
provided the longest FU, despite the limitations discussed in the previous section. This analysis group 
includes the first 90 patients with MCL enrolled from either Phase 1 or Phase 2, irrespective of 
pirtobrutinib starting dose, who have received a prior BTK inhibitor-containing regimen. It should be 
noted that 6 patients started on a lower dose, up to the target 200 mg QD dose, while 2 and 5 patients 
started with 250 and 300 mg QD dose respectively. 
Regarding protocol deviations, data were not provided for PAS analysis. However, major deviation only 
occurred for 7 and 1 patients in cohorts 1 and 7 respectively, without any anticipated impact of the 
reliability of the results. 
EMA/308908/2023  
Page 94/122 
 
 
  
 
 
In the PAS, median time on treatment is 5.24 months (range: 0.2 to 39.6 months). Patients in the PAS 
had a median time on study of 10.45 months (range: 0.5 to 34.4 months).  
Demographics data for age, sex and weight are globally in line with targeted indication. In the PAS 
population, subjects had received a median number of 3 prior lines of systemic therapy, with 1 prior 
BTKi. Discontinuation from this previous BTKi was most of the time (81.1%) due to disease 
progression. 
Primary endpoint: ORR 
By IRC assessment, the ORR was 56.7% in PAS, including 18.9% of CR.  
This is higher than the rates obtained with available R/R MCL post BTKi treatments such as 
bortezomib, lenalidomide, and temsirolimus but lower than those reported for brexucabtagene 
autoleuel (85%) and salvage therapies like R-BAC (83%) or Rituximab + Ibrutinib (88%), in the same 
setting, even though it is difficult to make comparisons across different studies. In any case, given the 
limited choice of treatments and the prognosis in this patient population, the reported results are 
considered clinically significant. 
Differences between IRC and investigators assessments were observed even though the Kappa 
coefficient for overall response, was estimated as 0.843 (95% CI: 0.733, 0.954) indicates a good 
agreement between the 2 assessments. The applicant provided details of discrepancies between 
investigator and IRC assessment for the 25 patients presenting a different evaluation of best overall 
response, in the form of patient narratives.  A variety of reasons for discrepancies were identified, such 
as different lesion selection, reader discrepancy and missing confirmatory bone marrow and in most 
cases do not impact on the overall response for the patient. The CHMP agreed that the impact of the 
discordant assessments in BOR have minimal impact on the overall evaluation of the efficacy of 
pirtobrutinib.  
Secondary endpoints 
At time of the latest data cut-off date, with a median FU of 12.68 months (5.78, 25.82) and based on 
IRC assessment, of 51 responding patients, the median duration of response was 17.61 months (7.29, 
27.24). A DOR of less than 6 months was noted in 47% of the responders, and more than 18 months 
for 19.6% of the responders. Moreover, the Kaplan-Meier plot of duration response shows a stable 
DOR for about half of responders between 6 and 18 months. Considering the poor prognosis of this 
population once BTKi refractory, these data are promising.  
Based on IRC, time to response and time to best response are 1.84 month and 1.87 month 
respectively, and less than 2 months for 80% of patients. This is consistent with others BTKi 
authorised and, regarding the rapid course of the disease, clinically significant. 
PFS results for PAS are promising, despite a median of 7.36 month (IRC assessment). Rates of PFS are 
40% at 12 months and 34% at 18 months.  
Among the 90 patients included in the PAS analysis, 44 (57.1%) were censored, including 31 patients 
(40.3%) which were still alive. The median OS was 23.46 [14.72; NE]). It should be noted that an 18 
months OS or more was reached in 58.7% of patients (45.5, 69.5).  
These data, even taking into account methodological uncertainties with regards to interpretation of 
time to event endpoints, are encouraging and are clinically significant and support the efficacy of the 
product in the claimed indication. 
EMA/308908/2023  
Page 95/122 
 
 
  
 
 
Subgroups analysis 
Despite limitations of subgroup analysis due to the study design, limited sample size of subgroups and 
short FU, it was noted that response rates appeared to be higher for low grade disease (Ann Arbor, 
MCL international prognostic index) or better prognosis (ECOG<2, Bulk<5cm, absence of bone marrow 
or gastrointestinal involvement). Of note no strong conclusion can be made between response rate and 
MCL histology due to the small sample size for pleomorphic and blastoid subtypes in the PAS 
population. Surprisingly, better response rates are observed for patients with >3 prior lines of systemic 
therapies; this observation is however tempered by a shorter DOR.  Finally better responses are 
observed for patients who discontinued previous BTKi for toxicity instead of disease progression. 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
The single arm, open-label study design limits the ability to make any direct comparisons against other 
available therapies which in the post-BTK inhibitor population is limited to CAR-T therapy and has 
limited utility for many patients with relapsed MCL. Another limitation is the interpretation of data, in 
particular with regards to assessment of time to event endpoints. These uncertainties will be addressed 
through the ongoing confirmatory Phase 3 Study in previously treated, but BTK inhibitor-naive, patient 
with MCL (Study 20019 [BRUIN-MCL-321]). This is a global, open-label, Phase 3 randomised study in 
previously treated, but BTK inhibitor-naive, patients with MCL, randomised 1:1 between pirtobrutinib 
experimental arm and the Investigator’s choice of covalent BTK inhibitor. The proposed confirmatory 
study is for a different patient population with MCL who have not yet received a BTK inhibitor, in an 
earlier line of therapy than for which the initial marketing authorisation is sought. This is considered 
necessary for the feasibility of this confirmatory study.  
The primary endpoint of the study is PFS as assessed by the IRC per the Lugano 2014 criteria (Cheson 
et al. 2014). PFS, as the primary endpoint for this study, serves as a surrogate for OS and is used 
because of the protracted duration of follow-up expected to reach an OS endpoint. Overall survival is a 
secondary endpoint for the study. At the time of the primary PFS analysis, the secondary OS analysis 
will seek to establish that there is no detrimental impact on survival, with a potential to observe a 
positive trend in OS. 
The results from the study are expected to be available by 31 March 2026. 
2.5.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy  
The clinical efficacy data submitted in this MAA support the benefit of pirtobrutinib in the final agreed 
indication. The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data 
in the context of a conditional MA: 
• 
The final study report of the phase 3 open-label, randomised Study of LOXO-305 versus 
investigator choice of BTK inhibitor in patients with previously treated BTK inhibitor-naive 
Mantle Cell Lymphoma (BRUIN-MCL-321) should be provided. 
2.5.8.  Clinical safety  
2.5.8.1.  Patient exposure  
The main safety analysis sets in support of this application comes from patients receiving pirtobrutinib 
monotherapy on Study 18001 (Table 31). This study includes a Phase 1 dose escalation and 
EMA/308908/2023  
Page 96/122 
 
 
  
 
 
 
expansion portion, as well as a Phase 2 part. The primary objective of Phase 1 was to determine the 
MTD and/or RP2D of pirtobrutinib through safety characterisation. From Phase 1, the RP2D of 
pirtobrutinib 200 mg QD was selected and used for Phase 2. The primary objective of Phase 2 was to 
assess the antitumor activity of pirtobrutinib based on ORR by IRC.  
For the primary safety analysis, patient safety data from Phase 1, all dose levels, and Phase 2 
monotherapy data are pooled. At least one dose of pirtobrutinib 200mg QD or above were received by 
96% of patients in OMTSAS and 97% of patients in MSAS, while other patients received a lower dose 
(25mg to 150 mg). 
Exposure fata from the two data cut-off dates for the safety data base are summarised in Table 37.

Dose intensity 
The Study 18001 protocol allowed dose interruptions, reductions, and escalations at the discretion of 
the treating physician. Relative dose intensity was defined in the SCS SAP as the percentage of dose 
received relative to the planned dose through to treatment discontinuation. Mean dose intensity was 
high (>95%) for both OMTSAS and MSAS, and median dose intensity was 100% for MSAS and 99.68% 
for OMTSAS. Similar data were observed for patients who received the intended dose of 200 mg QD in 
OMTSAS. 
Dose modification 
Dose modifications were frequent and were primarily dose interruptions (51.7% in OMTSAS and 42.7% 
in MSAS) of which the main reason was AE (29.8% in OMTSAS and 26.6% in MSAS), patient error 
(19.0% in OMTSAS and 15.9% in MSAS) and procedure (16.7% in OMTSAS and 10.4% in MSAS). Most 
(80%) of dose interruptions due to patient error had a duration of one day. 
Dose reductions were less frequent than dose interruptions (5.5% of patients in MSAS and 6.5% in 
OMTSAS) and were mainly related to AEs.  
Finally dose increases were mainly related to intra-patient dose escalation during the phase I. In 
addition, some patients who had their dose-reduced and who could tolerate pirtobrutinib were allowed 
to re-escalate to the preceding dose level.

At baseline, most patients in the OMTSAS had an ECOG score of either 0 (364 [50.2%]) or 1 (320 
[44.1%]) The median time since initial diagnosis to first dose of study treatment was 97.95 months 
(range: 0.5, 739.4) in the OMTSAS, and was lower in the MSAS (72.38 [range: 4.5, 209.6]) and higher 
in the CSAS (133.95 [range: 8.2, 374.5]) than in the OMTSAS.  
Prior cancer treatment 
In OMTSAS and MSAS, the vast majority of patients received a prior BTK inhibitor (78.1% and 91.5% 
respectively), a prior anti-CD20 antibody (93.2% and 97.0% respectively) or a prior chemotherapy 
EMA/308908/2023  
Page 98/122 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(86.8% and 90.9% respectively). In addition, prior CART-therapy was received by 6.9% and 7.9% 
patients respectively in OMTSAS and MSAS and prior stem cell transplant by 9.2% and 24.4% of 
patients respectively. 
The median number of line of prior systemic therapy was 3.0 in both OMTSAS and MSAS. The main 
reason for prior discontinuation from most recent BTK inhibitor was disease progression (58.6% in 
OMTSAS and 76.2% in MSAS) while toxicity was the reason for 13.1% of patients in OMTSAS and 
9.1% of patients in MSAS. 
Concomitant medication 
Concomitant medications were recorded including those started 14 days prior to enrolment through the 
end of study. Overall, 96.3% of patients in the OMTSAS were treated with concomitant medications.  
Medications used at a high incidence in patients in the OMTSAS tended to be supportive medications 
such as anti-bacterials (442 [61.0%]), antiviral agents (411 [56.7%]), and analgesics (342 [47.2%]). 
Other concomitant treatments supportive in B-cell cancers were widely used in the study, including 
anti-gout preparations (304 [41.9%]), immunostimulants (135 [18.6%]), blood substitutes and 
perfusion solutions (123 [17.0%]), and immune sera and immunoglobulins (90 [12.4%]). The 
concomitant medications used were in-line with standard clinical practice management of MCL, 
CLL/SLL and other NHL. 
Additionally, multiple concomitant medications were reported in patients in the OMTSAS consistent 
with a population of advanced age with a baseline increased risk for cardiovascular disease, including 
antithrombotic agents (218 [30.1%]), lipid modifying agents (195 [26.9%]), beta blocking agents (177 
[24.4%]), agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system (170 [23.4%]), diuretic (135 [18.6%]), and 
calcium channel blockers (131 [18.1%]).

Other frequent adverse events in OMTSAS and MSAS respectively included, dyspnoea, cough, 
arthralgia, back pain, pyrexia, oedema peripheral, abdominal pain and headache, all of which have 
been described for other BTK inhibitors. 
Treatment–related adverse event with an incidence ≥ 5% were related to gastro-intestinal events 
(diarrhoea), haematological events (neutrophil count decrease and neutropenia), contusion and 
fatigue.  
Grade 3 or 4 adverse events 
Grade 3/4 adverse events were mainly related to SOC Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders and 
infections and infestations.  
In OMTSAS [at 200mg] and MSAS respectively, grade 3/4 PT related to haematological toxicity were 
neutrophil count decrease (10.6% [10.3%] and 8.5%), neutropenia (8.6% [8.3%] and 3.7%), 
anaemia (7.7% [8.0%] and 4.9%), platelet count decrease (4.8% [4.8%] and 5.5%), febrile 
neutropenia (2.2% [2.5%] and 1.2%), leucocytosis (1.9% [2.0%] and 3.7%) and thrombocytopenia 
(1.8% [2.0%] and 1.2%).  
Grade 3/4 PT related to infections were, respectively for OMTSAS and MSAS: pneumonia (4.8% [4.8%] 
and 7.9%), COVID-19 pneumonia (4.8% [4.1%] and 2.4%), COVID-19 (2.3% [2.2%] and 2.4%), 
sepsis (2.2% [2.3%] and 3.0%).  
Other grade 3/4 occurring in ≥1% of patients were fatigue, acute kidney injury, ALT increase, 
hypotension, atrial fibrillation and pleural infusion. In addition, grade 3/4 respiratory failure occurred at 
1.6% in OMTSAS [1.3%] and 2.4% in MSAS, and dyspnoea occurred at 1.6% in OMTSAS [0.9%] and 
3.6% in MSAS.  
Adverse Drug Reactions 
For the determination of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), the applicant used descriptive analytical 
criteria for the initial screening of the AE and abnormal categorical numerical safety data in the 
registration trial Study 18001. Scientific and medical judgment including incidence and severity of 
event, biological plausibility and known association with other Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors was 
used to assess the relationship with pirtobrutinib and to determine whether the event was clinically 
significant and medically informative.  
Events that met the initial screening criteria and/or were considered medically informative and 
clinically significant were designated as ADRs for single agent pirtobrutinib in patients with previously 
treated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/ small lymphocytic lymphoma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 
including mantle cell lymphoma and are shown in with their associated all Grade and Grade ≥ 3 
frequencies from the OMTSAS and  for patients that received the intended 200mg dose QD as the 
starting dose and who did not subsequently dose escalate.

Deaths 
In OMTSAS, up until the 31st January 2022 data cut-off, 6.2% (45 patients) had an AE with fatal 
outcome within 28 days of the last dose of pirtobrutinib. More than half of these fatal AEs pertained to 
SOC infections and infestations (64.4%) of which the half were related to COVID-19 (51.7%). Fatal 
AEs considered related to pirtobrutinib by the investigator were observed for 4/45 patients and were all 
of infectious nature (included COVID-19 pneumonia, pneumonia necrotising, respiratory failure, and 
Enterococcus faecium-related septic shock).  
Other deaths that occurred within 28 days of last dose pertained to SOC General disorders and 
administration site conditions (4 patients), Cardiac disorders (1 patient with cardiac arrest), Vascular 
disorders (1 patient with septic shock and 1 patient with massive haemorrhage), Respiratory, thoracic

and mediastinal disorders (4 patients), Nervous system disorders (1 patient), Injury, poisoning and 
procedural complications (1 patient), Metabolism and nutrition disorders (1 patient).  
Other serious adverse events 
In study 18001, SAEs were experienced by a third of the patients (Table 41) and were mainly related 
to infections which is expected both in the intended population and in the context of neutropenia-
induced AEs.

study. Aggregate analysis was conducted as part of the analysis of AESI to characterise the safety 
profile of these events and included the following composite terms: cytopenia (specifically, 
neutropenia, anaemia, and thrombocytopenia), infections, bleeding (including bruising and 
haemorrhage), and atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. A summary of the cumulative incidence of 
adverse events of AESIs per exposure duration is presented in Table 42.

Adverse events of potential clinical significance (data cut-off 31 January 2022) 
Second primary malignancies 
In OMTSAS, second primary malignancies occurred in 6.6% (48 patients) of patients with 33/48 being 
non melanoma skin cancer, of which 35/48 were grade 2, 8 grade 3 events and 1 grade 4 event. These 
SPM were in majority non melanoma skin cancers. None of these skin cancer event was fatal or 
considered as SAE. 
In MSAS, 6 patients (3.7%) had a second primary malignancy (1 anal squamous cell carcinoma not 
resolved, 3 basal cell carcinomas, 2 melanomas, 1 recurrent urothelial carcinoma). 4 patients had a 
grade 2 event and the two other patients had each a grade 1 and grade 3. 1/6 events was considered 
as SAE (recurrent urothelial carcinoma) but none was considered related to pirtobrutinib. One event on 
the 6 required pirtobrutinib discontinuation (squamous cell carcinoma) which was the only dose 
modification; to be noted, in MSAS, the median time to first onset was 57.43 weeks which is far above 
the median treatment duration of 4.5 months. 
Tumour lysis syndrome 
In study 18001, tumour lysis syndrome occurred in 4 patients of which 1 patient with CLL received 
pirtobrutinib in association with venetoclax and had two event of TLS. In OMTSAS, on the 3 remaining 
patients who received pirtobrutinib monotherapy, one patient had a MCL and 2 patients had B-cell 
prolymphocytic lymphoma.  
EMA/308908/2023  
Page 104/122 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, as reported by the applicant, there was 1 case of a fatal TLS event in a patient with 
follicular lymphoma that was assessed as being related to pirtobrutinib. This case was reported in a 
separate ongoing trial conducted in China not part of the safety dataset (the OMTSAS) for this 
application.  
Lymphocytosis 
The applicant analysed lymphocytosis as a composite event of leucocytosis, lymphocyte count 
increase, lymphocytosis and white blood cell count increase. In OMTSAS and MSAS, 4.8% and 6.1% of 
patients respectively experienced lymphocytosis with the majority that were grade 3 and with one 
patient experiencing a grade 4 event. Furthermore, the majority (8/10) was considered related to 
pirtobrutinib and 3/10 were considered as SAE. Lymphocytosis was managed with treatment 
interruption in 3 patients. Time to first onset was short in general, within the first 4 weeks and with a 
median time to first onset of 1.14 week which is consistent with safety profile of other BTK inhibitors.  
Cardiovascular events 
Hypertension was the most frequent cardiac event (9.5% in OMTSAS with 2.8% of grade 3 and no 
grade ≥ 4, and 3.7% in MSAS with only grades 1 or 2) and approximately a third of these events were 
considered related to pirtobrutinib. None of the events of hypertension was considered serious.  
Median time of onset was 23.71 weeks in OMTSAS and 18.14 weeks in MSAS, with the majority of 
events occurring after 12 weeks but early time of first onset occurred also. Overall, events of 
hypertension were managed with pirtobrutinib interruption only in few cases.  
Supraventricular tachyarrhythmia (excluding cases of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter) occurred at 
2.9% in OMTSAS with 0.6% ≥ grade 3, and at 2.4% (4 patients) in MSAS with only grades 1/2 of 
which 2 events were considered related to pirtobrutinib. Events were considered serious in 0.6% of 
patients in OMTSAS and none in MSAS. Median time to first onset was 7.29 weeks in OMTSAS and 3.14 
weeks in MSAS. No pattern of time to first onset can be observed. Overall, most of events of 
supraventricular tachyarrhythmia were managed without dose modification, only one patients in 
OMTSAS had pirtobrutinib interruption. 
Heart failure occurred in 1.4% of patients in the OMTSAS with half of the cases being grades 1/2 and 
the other half being grade 3/4. In MSAS, heart failure occurred in 1 patient (0.6%, grade 2) that was 
considered related to pirtobrutinib. No grade 5 events was observed. Events were considered serious in 
0.6% of patients in OMTSAS and none in MSAS. Median time to first onset was approximately 12 
weeks in both analysis set and all events occurred after 8 weeks. Overall, heart failure was managed 
with dose reduction for the patient in MSAS and with drug interruption (2 patients, 0.3%) or dose 
reduction (0.1%, 2 patient) in OMTSAS. 
Ventricular arrhythmia occurred in 0.7% (5 patients) in OMTSAS and in 0.6% (1 patient) in MSAS. All 
events were of grade 1/2. 2 events in OMTSAS and the event in MSAS were considered related to 
pirtobrutinib. None of the events was considered serious and no grade 5 event occurred. Median time 
of onset was approximately 16 weeks in both analyses sets and most events occurred after 12 weeks. 
All the events of ventricular arrhythmia were managed without dose modification.

Rash 
Rash is a known ADR of other BTK inhibitors (ibrutinib, zanubrutinib, acalabrutinib) with a very 
common frequency. Overall, the assessment of the applicant stating that rash did not translate into a 
clinically significant safety finding for pirtobrutinib can be followed. 
Events of rash occurred in 12.3% of patients in OMTSAS and in 8.5% of patients in MSAS. The 
majority of events were grade 1 or 2 with only 3 patients in OMTSAS and 1 patient in MSAS who 
experienced a grade 3 event. Approximately half of the cases were considered related to study 
treatment. None of the events was considered serious and no grade 4 or 5 event occurred. Most of the 
time, rash events were managed without dose modification and in some cases with dose interruption 
or dose reduction in fewer cases. One event led to permanent discontinuation (non-serious related AE 
of maculo-papular rash in a patient with SLL). 
Median time of first onset was approximately 6 weeks for both analysis set with events occurring as 
soon as within the first 4 weeks of treatment or after 12 weeks of treatment.  
2.5.8.4.  Laboratory findings  
Analyses of data from clinical laboratory evaluations were consistent with the analyses of AEs reported 
in OMTSAS for Study 18001.  
Haematology (neutrophils, haemoglobin, platelets, lymphocytes) laboratory abnormalities were present 
at baseline, while some worsened while on treatment, these changes were transient with most having 
returned to baseline or better as of the last post-baseline value recorded. 
Chemistry laboratory values were also in accordance with the reported AEs. Blood creatinine increase 
was reported as an AE in 4.7% of patients in OMTSAS, even though laboratory findings suggest a 
higher incidence (26.5%). However, both reported AE and laboratory values suggest low grade events 
for creatinine increases and in approximately 90% of cases, values had return to their baseline grade 
or better at the last post baseline assessment. 
 No additional safety signals were identified from clinical laboratory evaluations.

2.5.8.9.  Discontinuation due to adverse events  
In the OMTSAS, 45 (6.2%) patients experienced an AE that led to permanent treatment 
discontinuation (Data cut-off 31 January 2022). Of the AEs that led to permanent treatment 
discontinuation, only COVID-19 pneumonia (4 [0.6%]), COVID-19 and myelodysplastic syndrome (3 
[0.4%] each), and pneumonia, sepsis, and squamous cell carcinoma (2 [0.3%] each) occurred in more 
than one patient. However, multiple AEs leading to discontinuation represent events of an infectious 
nature and second primary malignancy The SOCs with the highest incidences of AEs leading to 
treatment discontinuation were Infections and Infestations (17 [2.3%]) followed by Neoplasms Benign, 
Malignant and Unspecified (Including Cysts and Polyps) (8 [1.1%]) (SCS Table 14.4.12.1). No other 
SOCs had AEs leading to treatment discontinuation with incidences ≥ 1%. 
There were 15 (2.1%) patients that had treatment permanently discontinued for an AE related to study 
treatment in the OMTSAS. Each study treatment-related AE that led to discontinuation occurred in 1 
(0.1%) patient only.  
The incidences of study treatment-related AEs that led to the treatment discontinuation were generally 
similar across analysis sets (MSAS: 5 [3.0%] patients; CSAS 8 [2.6%] patients; OMTSAS 15 [2.1%] 
patients). 
2.5.8.10.  Post marketing experience  
Not applicable. 
2.5.9.  Discussion on clinical safety  
The characterisation of the safety profile of pirtobrutinib is based on a single non-comparative phase 
1/2 study. At the latest data cut-off (29 July 2022), 773 patients in total with MCL, CLL/SLL and other 
NHL received pirtobrutinib as monotherapy (“OMTSAS” analysis set). Among these, only 166 patients 
had MCL (“MSAS” analysis set) so the safety data of pirtobrutinib in the intended indication is limited. 
However, given the rarity of MCL and the safety information from the larger database, including other 
B-cell malignancies, the overall safety database is considered acceptable. 
At the data cut-off, approximately half of the patients in OMTSAS and one third of the patients in MSAS 
were still on treatment. While this difference between both analyses sets was mainly attributed to the 
number of patients who discontinued the study due to progressive disease, the incidence of 
discontinuation due to AEs was comparable. 
Both safety analysis sets include patients treated with other doses than the intended dose of 200mg. 
This is due to the inclusion of patients issued from the dose escalation part of the pivotal trial. Data of 
patients who received a different dose than 200mg (lower or higher) do not appear to alter the safety 
results, even though they represent a small percentage of the overall safety population. Nevertheless, 
the table of ADRs for inclusion in section 4.8 of the SmPC at the request of the CHMP is based only on 
data from patients who received the intended starting dose of 200mg QD and who did not 
subsequently dose escalate.

Adverse events 
AEs were experienced by approximately 90% of patients in both analyses sets with 60% considered 
related to pirtobrutinib. Grade 3/4 AEs were experienced by 46.9% of patients in OMTSAS and 39.6% 
of patients in MSAS, of which half were considered related to pirtobrutinib. SAEs were experienced by 
one third of the patients but only 5% were considered related to pirtobrutinib.  
Fatal AEs were experienced by 6.2% and 6.7% of patients in OMTSAS and MSAS respectively. 
Although 4 patients (0.6%) had a fatal AE considered related to pirtobrutinib in OMTSAS, none of the 
fatal AE was considered related to pirtobrutinib in MSAS.  
Overall, common adverse events observed with pirtobrutinib monotherapy in pivotal study 18001 were 
consistent with the reported safety profile of the other authorised BTK inhibitors. 
In OMTSAS and MSAS respectively, common adverse events pertained primarily to SOC of 
Gastrointestinal disorders (50.6% and 46.3% in OMTSAS and MSAS respectively), General disorders 
and administration site conditions (47.9% and 50.0%) and Infections and infestations (46.9% and 
50.0%). Grade 3/4 adverse events pertained mainly to SOC Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders 
and Infections and infestations while gastro-intestinal events were of low grade in general. 
In OMTSAS, the most common adverse events by PT were fatigue (26.3%), diarrhoea (22.1%), and 
contusion (19.0%) with similar profile in MSAS and have been included in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Other frequent adverse in OMTSAS and MSAS included arthralgia, back pain, oedema peripheral, 
abdominal pain and headache, which have been described for other BTK inhibitors. These have also 
been included in section 4.8 of the SmPC with the exception of back pain and oedema peripheral, due 
to the absence of ≥ grade 3 events and the absence of suggested mechanism of action. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
In addition, considering that fatigue was a very common adverse event, and that dizziness and 
asthenia were also reported in association with pirtobrutinib, the product information includes a 
warning that pirtobrutinib may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines which 
should be considered when assessing a patient’s ability to drive or operate machines. 
Adverse event of special interest 
Infections are known ADRs of BTK inhibitors, related to both the nature of the disease to be treated 
and to treatment induced of neutropenia. Serious infections, including fatal cases, have occurred in 
patients treated with pirtobrutinib. The most frequently reported Grade 3 or higher infections were 
pneumonia, COVID-19 pneumonia, COVID-19, and sepsis. The product information recommends 
prophylactic antimicrobial therapy in patients who are at increased risk for opportunistic infections. 
Based on the grade of infection and whether it occurs with neutropenia, dose interruption may be 
required. 
Bleeding including fatal cases, have occurred in patients treated with pirtobrutinib, with and without 
thrombocytopenia. Major bleeding events of Grade 3 or higher, including gastrointestinal bleeding and 
intracranial haemorrhage were also observed. Warnings about the need to monitor patients for signs 
and symptoms of bleeding are included in the product information. Patients receiving anticoagulant or 
antiplatelet agents may be at increased risk of haemorrhage. The risks and benefits of anticoagulant or 
antiplatelet therapy should be considered when co administered with pirtobrutinib and consider 
additional monitoring for signs of bleeding. The use of pirtobrutinib has not been studied with warfarin 
or other vitamin K antagonists. 
EMA/308908/2023  
Page 109/122 
 
 
  
 
 
 
The benefit risk of withholding pirtobrutinib for 3 to 5 days pre- and post-surgery should be considered 
depending upon the type of surgery and risk of bleeding. Serious haemorrhages and infections are 
both considered as important identified risks in the pirtobrutinib RMP. 
Another class effect of BTK inhibitor is cytopenia. Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias, including neutropenia, 
anaemia and thrombocytopenia occurred in patients treated with pirtobrutinib. Complete blood counts 
should be monitored in patients during treatment as medically indicated. The SmPC of pirtobrutinib 
includes recommendations of dosing modification in section 4.2 in case of haematological toxicity with 
interruption in case of Grade 3 neutropenia associated with fever and/or infection, Grade 4 neutropenia 
lasting≥7 days, Grade 3 thrombocytopenia associated with bleeding and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia. 
Reintroduction at either original dose or a reduced dose is also recommended depending on the 
number occurrence. In addition, neutropenia, anaemia, and thrombocytopenia are listed in section 4.8. 
Finally, atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter occurred in patients in both OMTSAS and MSAS. Almost one 
third of the patients had a grade 3/4 events and 5 cases were considered as SAE. 
While it is acknowledged that the intended population for pirtobrutinib is at increased risk of atrial 
fibrillation (advanced age, cardiovascular co-morbidities), it is also a known ADR of other BTK 
inhibitors. Therefore, it is included in the RMP as an important identified risk and in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC together with a warning in section 4.4 that signs and symptoms of atrial fibrillation and atrial 
flutter should be monitored in patients and an electrocardiogram should be obtained as medically 
indicated. Based on the grade of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, dose interruption may also be required. 
Additional events of clinical importance 
Second primary malignancies were observed in both safety analysis sets, the majority of which were 
non-melanoma skin cancers.  
The CHMP acknowledged that the included population is at increased risk of SPM and that previous 
treatments are also potentially confounding factors. Even though it is not possible to establish a direct 
causality with pirtobrutinib, patients should be monitored for the appearance of skin cancers and 
advise protection from sun exposure. In addition, second primary malignancies, non-melanoma skin 
cancer and other second primary malignancies have been included in the RMP as important potential 
risks and the applicant will conduct an analysis of the incidence of these events from ongoing clinical 
studies with pirtobrutinib with a 5-year follow-up. 
Tumour lysis syndrome occurred in a small number of patients who received pirtobrutinib monotherapy 
in the pivotal trial with one fatal case reported in another trial which was not part of the safety dataset 
for this submission. TLS is uncommon in patients treated with ibrutinib and acalabrutinib. Furthermore, 
in the Study 18001 OMTSAS population, TLS occurred often in the context of disease progression 
particularly in patients with very high tumour burden. All cases except 1 (reported in a separate 
ongoing trial conducted in China not part of the safety dataset for this application) were assessed by 
the investigator to be not related to pirtobrutinib. Nevertheless, 2 cases had a suggestive chronology 
of TLS.  Therefore, a direct causal role of pirtobrutinib cannot be ascertained at this stage. The product 
information, however, includes a warning that patients at high risk of TLS are those with high tumour 
burden prior to treatment and that patients should be assessed for possible risk of TLS and closely 
monitored as clinically indicated. 
Lymphocytosis was analysed as a composite event of leucocytosis, lymphocyte count increase, 
lymphocytosis and white blood cell count increase. Most cases identified were grade 3 and one was a 
grade 4 event. Furthermore, the majority was considered related to pirtobrutinib and in some cases 
EMA/308908/2023  
Page 110/122 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
was managed with treatment interruption. Lymphocytosis is listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC which is 
considered acceptable.  
In addition to atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter other cardiovascular events were observed including 
some high grades in OMTSAS (for supraventricular tachyarrhythmia, heart failure and hypertension). 
These events were managed generally without dose modification and with dose interruption in some 
cases.  
Whilst causality between the observed cardiovascular events and pirtobrutinib cannot be established 
based on the available data, cases of cardiac failure, cardiac arrhythmia and hypertension will be 
closely monitored in PSURs. 
Events of rash were observed in the pivotal trial but were mainly low grade, non-serious reactions. 
Rash is a known ADR of other BTK with a very common frequency and inclusion in Section 4.8 with the 
same frequency is considered sufficient at this stage to manage this risk.  
Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
As exposure to pirtobrutinib in MCL patients is still limited, additional data are expected in order to 
further characterise the important identified risks associated with its use from the ongoing comparative 
study in BTK inhibitor-naive, patients with MCL (Study 20019 [BRUIN-MCL-321]). 
2.5.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety  
Despite limitations arising from the limited exposure of pirtobrutinib in the intended target population 
which is a consequence of the rarity of the claimed indication and the non-comparative nature of the 
pivotal trial which hampers causality assessment, the overall safety profile of pirtobrutinib appears to 
be consistent with those of authorised BTK inhibitors. Main toxicities are related to high grade 
haematological toxicity and infections and low-grade gastrointestinal events. The inclusion of 
information on when to interrupt treatment in the product information is considered sufficient to 
manage these risks. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the 
context of a conditional MA:

2.6.4.  Conclusion  
The CHMP considers that the risk management plan version 0.3 is acceptable. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
2.7.1.  Pharmacovigilance system  
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.7.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 27.01.2023. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.8.  Product information  
2.8.1.  User consultation  
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on

• 
It contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU; 
It is approved under a conditional marketing authorisation [REG Art 14-a] 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context  
3.1.1.  Disease or condition  
The claimed indication for pirtobrutinib is for the treatment of adult patients with mantle cell lymphoma 
(MCL) who have been previously treated with a Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor. 
MCL is a rare and aggressive subtype of B-cell NHL and is incurable with current therapies. MCL 
accounts for 3% to 10% of all new NHL cases per year with a typical incidence of approximately 1 to 2 
per 100,000 in Europe and the US. Prognosis for patients with MCL is poor, with OS of 3 to 5 years at 
diagnosis. MCL is more common in men (3:1; male:female) and patients are typically aged 60 to 70 
years old at diagnosis, which influences treatment selection in frontline and for recurrence. Indolent 
subtypes of MCL have been characterised, however, the typical presentation of MCL is usually 
aggressive and incurable requiring treatment at diagnosis for most patients. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need  
As per current guidelines, the following therapeutic options are available: lenalidomide, bortezomib, 
temsirolimus. To be noted, all these treatments were authorised before BTK arrival, but nevertheless 
remain an option after BTK treatment. Moreover, brexucabtagene autoleucel is now indicated after BTK 
treatment. In addition, for some patients, allogenic stem cell transplantation using reduced-intensity 
conditioning and the possible use or re use of first line chemotherapies are feasible. Despite these 
treatments, prognosis after BTKi is still poor and additional alternatives are needed. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies  
The main study (18001) entitled “A Phase 1/2 Study of Oral LOXO-305 in Patients with Previously 
Treated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (CLL/SLL) or NHL”, is an open-
label, multicentre study of oral pirtobrutinib to evaluate safety and efficacy in patients with CLL/SLL 
and B-cell NHL, including MCL, who have failed or are intolerant to standard of care. 
3.2.  Favourable effects  
The primary analysis set (PAS) which is one closest to the claimed indication and which provides the 
longest follow-up of patients, included the first 90 patients with MCL enrolled from either Phase 1 or 
Phase 2 of the study, irrespective of pirtobrutinib starting dose, who have received a prior BTK 
inhibitor-containing regimen. Demographics data for age, sex and weight are globally in line with 
EMA/308908/2023  
Page 115/122 
 
 
  
 
 
targeted indication. In the PAS population, subjects had received a median number of 3 prior lines of 
systemic therapy, with 1 prior BTKi. 
The primary endpoint, ORR was 56.7% in PAS, by IRC assessment, of which 18.9% were reported as 
achieving complete response.   
Median duration of response was 17.61 months (7.29, 27.24). The Kaplan-Meier plot of duration 
response shows a stable DOR for about half of responders between 6 and 18 months. Based on IRC 
assessment, time to response and time to best response are 1.84 month and 1.87 month respectively, 
and less than 2 months for 80% of patients. Rates of PFS are 40% at 12 months and 34% at 18 
months. 18 months OS or more was reached in 59.3% of patients (46.1, 70.2). 
Subgroup analysis by demographic did not show any discrepancy in term of ORR and DOR. Response 
rates appear to be higher for low grade disease or better prognosis, surprisingly, better response rates 
are observed for patients with >3 prior lines of systemic therapies. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects  
The single arm design of the pivotal study and the lack of a comparator leads in uncertainties 
especially in relation to interpretation of time to event endpoints such as PFS and OS. In addition, 
important modifications were made to the study protocol, and two analysis plans were developed in 
parallel with inconsistent specifications, and no plan for multiplicity adjustment. Moreover, the SAPs 
were finalised late and revised shortly before the conduct of the primary analysis, with critical updates 
made to the sample size and to the analysis cut-off date.  Finally, the PAS included pooling of patients 
from Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the study and even a small number of patients that were not initiated on 
the target 200 mg QD dose. 
Despite these limitations, the reported results were considered promising especially in view of the poor 
prognosis of the target population. Reassurance around the methodological limitations was provided by 
the consistency of the results from various additional analyses and across different subgroup 
populations. Further confirmation of these results is expected with the ongoing randomised study 
20019 [BRUIN-MCL-321]. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects  
In study 18001, AEs were experienced by approximately 90% of patients in both main safety analyses 
sets, the Overall Monotherapy Safety Analysis Set (OMTSAS) and MCL Safety Analysis Set (MSAS) with 
60% considered related to pirtobrutinib. Grade 3 or 4 AEs were experienced by 46.9% of patients in 
OMTSAS and 39.6% of patients in MSAS, of which half were considered related to pirtobrutinib. 
Overall, the adverse events observed with pirtobrutinib monotherapy in pivotal study 18001 were 
consistent with the known safety profile of the other authorised BTK inhibitors. The most common 
adverse events were fatigue, diarrhoea, and contusion.  Grade 3/4 adverse events were reported 
mainly in the Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders and Infections and infestations SOCs while 
gastro-intestinal events were generally low grade. 
Cytopenias which are known ADRs of BTK inhibitors, were frequently reported as grade 3/4 but rarely 
considered as SAE and were mainly managed with treatment interruption.  
Infections occurred in 47.2% of patients in OMTSAS and 36% of patients in MSAS. A third of patients 
in OMTSAS and almost half patients in MSAS had grade ≥ 3 events or had a SAE. Infections were the 
main cause of death among patients who had a fatal AE (29/45 patients), representing more than half 
of these patients of which half were related to COVID-19.  
EMA/308908/2023  
Page 116/122 
 
 
  
 
 
Bleeding events occurred in approximately one third of patients (34.3% and 27.4% in OMTSAS and 
MSAS respectively) and were considered related to pirtobrutinib in more than half of the cases. In the 
majority of cases, these were of low grade. 
Atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter occurred in 2.6% of patients in OMTSAS and 3.7% in MSAS. Almost 
one third were of grade 3/4 event but few cases were considered as SAE. Although the majority of 
patients had a history of atrial fibrillation or other cardiac event, it is a known ADR of other BTK 
inhibitors and are described in the product information and included in the RMP as an important 
identified risk.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects  
The safety profile of pirtobrutinib for the current application is based on a single non comparative 
phase 1/2 study. The safety data in the intended indication (MSAS at 200mg) is limited to 166 
patients. It is reasonable to expect a similar safety profile in this population with the population of the 
larger OMTSAS which includes other types of B-cell malignancies, however this will be confirmed with 
the ongoing randomised study 20019 [BRUIN-MCL-321]. 
Second primary malignancies occurred in 6.6% of patients in OMTSAS which were mainly non-
melanoma skin cancers in common with what has been observed with other BTK inhibitors. Although it 
is acknowledged that the target population is at increased risk of SPM and the lack of a comparator 
does not allow for an accurate calculation of the incidence, the product information includes warnings 
for the monitoring of patients for the appearance of skin cancers and advise protection from sun 
exposure. The applicant is also planning a long-term analysis to better estimate the incidence of SPM 
in association with pirtobrutinib use based on ongoing studies. 
Tumour lysis syndrome occurred in a small number of patients in OMTSAS and uncertainties remain on 
whether these events were causally associated with pirtobrutinib. However, as this cannot be excluded 
the product information includes a warning in relation to this risk.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion  
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The pooled dataset from Phase 1 and Phase 2 shows the promising efficacy of pirtobrutinib in MCL 
patients with clinically significant overall response rate and meaningful duration of response, which in a 
rare type of lymphoma setting in patients with limited treatment options is highly favourable. The fact 
that one fifth of the subjects gained complete response is also meaningful for patients having an 
aggressive form of cancer.  
The identification of the safety profile of pirtobrutinib, although limited by the single arm trial and the 
small size of the intended population appears nevertheless reasonably adequately characterised in the 
larger overall monotherapy safety database.  
Overall, the safety profile of pirtobrutinib appears similar to the other marketed BTK inhibitors 
(cytopenia, infections, bleedings, gastrointestinal events, atrial fibrillation) and these are considered 
manageable with warnings in the product information. Further characterisation of the potential risk of 
second primary malignancies is planned through a cumulative analysis of ongoing studies. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks  
The population of the pivotal study in support of this application had a median 3 prior lines of systemic 
therapy, including 1 BTK inhibitor and is representative of the intended target population with limited 
therapeutic options. As most of these patients had discontinued BTK inhibitor treatment due to disease 
progression to better reflect the trial population, the CHMP requested that the initially proposed 
indication for pirtobrutinib is revised to relapsed and refractory MCL in patients previously treated with 
a BTK inhibitor.   
The uncertainties arising from the explorative nature of the main study and the methodological issues 
limit the ability to comprehensively evaluate the balance of benefits and risks. Nevertheless, 
considering the promising efficacy results which appeared consistent across different analyses and the 
acceptable safety profile, the CHMP considered that in the context of a CMA the benefit risk balance for 
pirtobrutinib is positive.

3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance  
Conditional marketing authorisation 
In the targeted indication for Jaypirca as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed 
or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have been previously treated with a Bruton’s tyrosine 
kinase (BTK) inhibitor, meaningful efficacy has been observed in patients receiving the proposed 200 
mg QD dose in terms of response rates and the corresponding duration of responses.  
The main uncertainties regarding the benefit assessment relate to the absence of a comparator which 
limits the interpretation of endpoints more directly linked to patient benefit such as PFS and OS, but 
also the limited sample size, and the duration of follow up.  
Similarly, safety and tolerability were maintained in patients in the pivotal trial. As pirtobrutinib will be 
used for an extended period of time owing to the durable responses seen, patient safety surveillance 
remains ongoing and determination of safety findings following more chronic exposure remains under 
evaluation. 
As comprehensive data on the product are not available, a conditional marketing authorisation was 
requested by the applicant in the initial submission. 
The product falls within the scope of Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 concerning 
conditional marketing authorisations, as it aims at the treatment of a life-threatening disease.  
Pirtobrutinib is designated as an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of MCL (EU/3/21/2450). 
Mantle cell lymphoma is a rare and aggressive subtype of NHL and, while indolent subtypes of MCL 
have been characterised, the classical presentation of MCL is typically aggressive and incurable, with 
treatment at diagnosis required for most patients. Frontline treatment selection is based on patient 
characteristics and candidacy for intensive chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) approaches, which yield high 
response rate including CRs with few however long-term remissions (Lenz et al. 2005; Flinn et al. 
2014). OS at diagnosis is estimated at only 3 to 5 years (Dreyling et al. 2018). 
Covalent  BTK  inhibitors  are  the  most  established  therapy  for  relapsed  MCL.  Patients  will  eventually 
relapse with a poor outlook, as available data of patients with MCL post BTK inhibition has reported a 
median OS between 2.5 to 8.4 months (Martin et al. 2016; Cheah et al. 2015; Epperla et al. 2017).  
Furthermore, the CHMP considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
authorisation: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive, as discussed. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data.  
To confirm the positive benefit-risk profile established in Study 18001 the applicant has initiated a 
confirmatory Phase 3 Study in previously treated, but BTK inhibitor-naive, patients with MCL 
(Study 20019 [BRUIN-MCL-321]). Specifically, Study 20019 is a global, open-label, Phase 3 
randomised study in previously treated, but BTK inhibitor-naive, patients with MCL, randomised 
1:1 between pirtobrutinib experimental arm and the Investigator’s choice of covalent BTK 
inhibitor. BTK inhibitors, ibrutinib, acalabrutinib or zanubrutinib, were selected according to local 
country availability in the comparative arm. Approximately 500 patients will be randomised 1:1 
between pirtobrutinib and the Investigator’s choice of BTK inhibitor therapy.  
The proposed confirmatory study is for a different patient population with MCL who have not yet 
received a BTK inhibitor; this could be acceptable from an efficacy and safety point of view. 
Feasibility of this confirmatory study is likely given the different patient population. The estimated 
study completion date is April 2025.

Unmet medical needs will be addressed: 
Treatment alternatives in the indication niche for pirtobrutinib include lenalidomide, bortezomib 
+/- rituximab and temsirolimus. The activity (ORR) of these drugs is reported around 20-30% 
and thus nominally lower than that for pirtobrutinib (58%). Moreover, this data derives from the 
pre-BTK era. Even though there are no efficacy metrics for these treatments from the current 
treatment paradigm i.e. adult patients with relapsed or refractory MCL who have been previously 
treated with a BTK inhibitor, it would be reasonable to expect that the activity of these 
treatments in this setting would be even lower.  Hence, even if this has not been demonstrated 
in a head-to-head comparison, pirtobrutinib is likely to provide a major therapeutic advantage 
over these products based on efficacy for adult patients with relapsed or refractory MCL who 
have been previously treated with a BTK inhibitor. 
While pirtobrutinib targets BTK, it is the first non-covalently binding agent. Data from the pivotal 
study clearly show that it retains activity also in patients who have developed resistance to first-
generation BTK inhibitors. Moreover, as re-use of first-generation BTK inhibitors post progression 
on a BTK is not authorised or rational, pirtobrutinib provides a new mechanism of action for the 
treatment of patients with MCL that have progressed on a first generation BTK inhibitor.  
The CAR-T therapy brexucabtagene autololeucel has a CMA in the same indication as that sought 
for pirtobrutinib. While the reported ORR appears to be higher than that of pirtobrutinib, many 
patients will not be sufficiently fit for this treatment modality, whose side effects include CRS 
and ICANS (which is not associated with BTK inhibitors). Moreover, there is an important lag 
time between leukapheresis and administration of the CAR-T cells, whereas pirtobrutinib is “off 
the shelf”. Thus, pirtobrutinib offers a meaningful therapeutic option for the larger population of 
patients with BTK inhibitor pretreated MCL, including those unable to receive CAR-T therapy or 
for whom CAR-T has been unsuccessful.  
Moreover, for patients that survive to more than one line of therapy after progression on a first 
BTK inhibitor, it provides a treatment alternative that is not cross resistant to other options. 
Thereby the novel mechanism of action constitutes a major therapeutic advantage. 
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required. 
Given the epidemiology data presented, a substantial number of patients may potentially benefit 
from treatment with pirtobrutinib over the period between Conditional Marketing Authorisation and 
full approval. Taking into account the short life expectancy of the intended target population and 
the  known  manufacturing  delays  for  the  initiation  of  CAR-T  therapy,  pirtobrutinib  immediate 
availability is considered of public health interest and outweighs the risks inherent to the fact that 
additional data are yet to be available for the Phase 3 confirmatory study. 
3.8.  Conclusions  
The overall benefit/risk balance of Jaypirca is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations  
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Jaypirca is not similar to Tecartus within the meaning of

final results from Study B3461075. This is a Phase 1 
interventional clinical drug-drug interaction study to 
estimate the effect of a multiple oral administration 
of Tafamidis on Rosuvastatin in pharmacokinetics

organic-transporting polypeptide transporters (OATP1B1 
and 1B3). 
However, in vitro tafamidis inhibits the efflux transporter 
BCRP (breast cancer resistant protein) with IC50=1.16 µM 
and may cause drug-drug interactions at clinically relevant 
concentrations with substrates of this transporter (e.g. 
methotrexate, rosuvastatin, imatinib). Likewise, tafamidis 
inhibits the uptake transporters OAT1 and OAT3 (organic 
anion transporters) with IC50=2.9 µM and IC50=2.36 µM, 
respectively, and may cause drug-drug interactions at 
clinically relevant concentrations with substrates of these 
transporters (e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 
bumetanide, furosemide, lamivudine, methotrexate, 
oseltamivir, tenofovir, ganciclovir, adefovir, cidofovir,

No cases of acute overdose have been reported. In clinical 
trials of healthy volunteers, the highest dose of tafamidis 
given was 120480 mg in a single dose and 60 mg once 
daily for two weeks. Four treatment-related adverse events 
were reported at these doses levels in healthy volunteers: 
headache (mild), somnolence (mild), myalgia (moderate), 
and insomnia (mild). The reported treatment-related 
adverse events were mild to moderate and included:

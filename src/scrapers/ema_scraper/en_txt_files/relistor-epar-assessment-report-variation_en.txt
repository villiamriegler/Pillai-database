2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Methylnaltrexone bromide is a quaternary derivative of the μ-opioid antagonist, naltrexone. Whereas 
naltrexone is used to counteract the CNS related effects of opioid treatment (including overdose), 
Methylnaltrexone bromide was designed to block the undesired peripheral side effects of opioids without 
interfering the central analgesic effects. 
Activation of μ-opioid receptors in the gastro-intestinal tract is responsible for inhibition of gut motility, 
whereas receptors in the central nervous system mediate the analgesic action of opioid. The use of 
Methylnaltrexone bromide as a peripheral μ-opioid receptor antagonist to counteract opioid induced 
constipation is the pharmacodynamic rationale. 
Efficacy of conventional laxatives in opioid induced constipation has not been fully established and only 
small prospective studies are available with some of the substances used in the setting. Commonly, 
recommendations for the treatment of opioid-related constipation have been made on the basis of 
personal experience and clinical observations. Recommendations usually comprise non-pharmacologic 
strategies, such as increasing dietary fibre and fluid intake. A variety of pharmacologic treatments 
representing the whole range of different substance classes in the treatment of obstipation is 
recommended. However, treatment failure appears to be common, and rescue medication, such as 
enemas and other measures (including digital removal of faeces) have to be used. 
Relistor (methylnaltrexone bromide) s.c. was licenced in the EU in July 2008  
- 
for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in advanced illness for patients receiving 
palliative care when response to usual laxative therapy has not been sufficient.  
These patients with “end stage disease with limited life-expectancy” represented mostly cancer pain 
patients.  
This application is for the extension of the indication to treat patients with opioid-induced constipation 
with non-cancer pain. The proposed wording of the additional indication is as follows: 
Relistor is indicated for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in adult patients, aged 18 years and 
older, with chronic non-cancer pain. 
The finally approved indication was summarised together with the existing indication to: 
Relistor is indicated for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation when response to laxative therapy 
has not been sufficient in adult patients, aged 18 years and older. 
No Scientific Advice has been received through centralised procedure for this proposed extension of 
indication. At submission of the dossier no specific guidance was available for the indication 
opioid-induced constipation (OIC).

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Repeated dose toxicity studies in mice, rats and dogs of up to 3, 6 and 9 months, respectively as well as 
2 year carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats were already part of the existing non-clinical data package 
and no further studies were needed in support of this extension of the patient population to non-cancer 
patients. 
The MAH submitted with this application for extension of the indication to adult non-cancer patients the 
documentation of a total of 7 new non-clinical studies. These consist of one primary and one secondary in 
vitro pharmacology study, two in vitro metabolism studies, one in vitro metabolism/distribution study, 
one analytical method validation report provided in the pharmacokinetics section and one analytical 
method validation report provided in the toxicology section.  
2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
MNIV0101 [The Effects of Methylnaltrexone, 6-Alpha-Methylnaltrexol, 
6-Beta-Methylnaltrexol and 3-Sulfo-Methylnaltrexone in In Vitro Human μ-, κ-, and δ-Opioid 
Receptor Binding Assay]. 
The study aimed at evaluation, in radioligand binding assays, of the activity of MNTX, 
6-alpha-methylnaltrexol (M4), 6-beta-methylnaltrexol (M5) and 3-sulfo-methylnaltrexone (M2) at the 
human μ-, κ-, and δ-opioid receptor expressed in mammalian cell lines.  
MNTX and its metabolites demonstrated binding to the human μ-opioid receptor expressed in CHO-K1 
cells with the following IC50 rank order of potency: M4 (34 nM) > MNTX (100 nM) > M5 (190 nM) >> M2 
(10.7 μM) (The corresponding Ki values were determined as 14 nM [M4], 42 nM [MNTX], 78 nM [M5] and 
4.33 µM [M2]). MNTX, M4 and M5 demonstrated similar binding to the human κ-opioid receptor 
expressed in HEK293 cells (IC50 values of 510 to 590 nM), while M2 had limited binding to the κ-opioid 
receptor, with an IC50 value of 21.4 μM. MNTX, M4, M5 and M2 had limited binding to the δ-opioid receptor 
with IC50 values of 33.1 μM, 32.6 μM, 45.6 μM, and >100 μM, respectively. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
MNIV0102 [The Effect of Methylnaltrexone, Naloxone and Naltrexone on Platelet Aggregation 
in Human Platelet Rich Plasma].  
The ability of MNTX, naltrexone and naloxone to affect platelet aggregation in vitro was investigated using 
human platelet rich plasma. MNTX, naloxone, and naltrexone did not induce platelet aggregation at either 
concentration tested (0.5 and 500 μM for naltrexone and naloxone, and 0.6 and 612 μM for MNTX). 
Inhibition of platelet aggregation was investigated using 4 substances that induce platelet aggregation: 
Adenosine diphosphate (ADP), arachidonic acid, platelet activating factor (PAF), and the stable 
thromboxane analog, U-46619. At the higher concentration, all three compounds exhibited inhibition of 
platelet aggregration. Inhibition of PAF-induced platelet aggregation was the most affected by MNTX, 
naloxone, and naltrexone. Naloxone (500 μM) inhibited PAF-induced platelet aggregation by 68%, 
naltrexone (500 μM) inhibited by 49%, and MNTX (612 μM) inhibited PAF-induced platelet aggregation by 
37%.

2.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods of analysis 
RPT-73085 [MOA-728: Long Term Storage Stability of MOA-728 in Dog Plasma] 
To evaluate the stability of MOA-728 in dog plasma, plasma samples spiked with 3 and 400 ng/mL 
MOA-728 were stored for 201 days at -70°C. Samples were analysed at day 0, 10 and 210 for MOA-728 
concentration using a validated LC/MS/MS method. The results showed that MOA-728 is stable under the 
indicated conditions. 
Distribution  
XT128007 [In Vitro Evaluation of Methylnaltrexone as an Inhibitor of Human P-gp, BCRP, 
OCT2 and MRP2 and Substrate of Human BCRP, MRP2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1 and OAT3 
Transporters] 
The ability of MNTX to inhibit P-gp and BCRP was evaluated by measuring the bidirectional permeability 
of a probe substrate across a monolayer of Caco-2 cells or MDCKII-BCRP cells in the presence of MNTX. 
Inhibition was assessed for MRP2 in membrane vesicles by measuring the effect of MNTX on the 
accumulation of a probe substrate in the vesicles, and for OCT2 in HEK293 cells by measuring the effect 
of MNTX on the accumulation of a probe substrate in the cells. To evaluate whether MNTX was a substrate 
of the human efflux transporter BCRP, the bidirectional permeability of MNTX was measured across 
MDCKII-BCRP and MDCKII control cells, and for the efflux transporter MRP2, by measuring the 
accumulation of MNTX in transporter expressing and control vesicles. To assess whether MNTX was a 
substrate of human uptake transporters, the accumulation of MNTX was measured in transporter 
expressing and control cells (HEK293cells for OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, and S2 cells for OAT1 and OAT3). 
Known inhibitors were included as positive controls in all experiments. In vitro , MNTX did not inhibit 
human P-gp or BCRP transporters at concentrations between 5 μM and 500 μM. OCT2 was inhibited 
48.4% in the presence of the highest concentration of MNTX (100 μM). MNTX was not a substrate of BCRP 
in MDCKII-BCRP cells, and did not accumulate in vesicles expressing MRP2, or in cells expressing 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, or OAT3, which suggests that MNTX is not a substrate of these transporters. 
2.2.4.  Toxicology  
Other toxicity studies 
Covance 8220358 [Validation of a Method for the Determination of RRT 0.60 in Rat Plasma by 
HPLC with MS/MS Detection] 
The objective of this study was to validate a method for the determination of RRT 0.60 (a degradant of 
MNTX, also known as WYE-129943) in rat plasma with K2EDTA as an anticoagulant by HPLC with MS/MS 
detection. RRT 0.60 and the internal standard (ISTD), MNTX bromide (N-methyl-13CD3), were extracted 
from samples by protein precipitation. After evaporation under nitrogen, the residue was reconstituted 
[0.5% formic acid in (10:90, v:v) methanol:water] and analysed using liquid chromatography with 
tandem mass spectrometric detection. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) for RRT 0.60 in rat plasma 
was 10.0 ng/mL, with linearity demonstrable to 1000 ng/mL (upper limit of quantitation, ULOQ), using a 
sample volume of 50.0 μL. Results were calculated using peak area ratios of analyte to ISTD, and 
calibration curves were generated using a weighted (1/x2 ) linear least-squares regression. The precision

and accuracy results for the quality control (QC) samples were within acceptance criteria, and it was 
therefore concluded that the method demonstrated acceptable precision and accuracy. Stability of RRT 
0.60 and MNTX bromide (N-methyl- 13CD 3 ) under a variety a variety of conditions. A quantitative 
procedure for the determination of RRT 0.60 in rat plasma, over the concentration range of 10.0 to 1000 
ng/mL, was successfully validated for use at Covance. The method utilised a sample volume of 50.0 μL. 
2.2.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The PEC for the indication palliative care was 0.00096 µg/l and no Phase II ERA was necessary. The new 
indication leads to a clear increase in the number of patients treated. Methylnaltrexone bromide has a log 
Kow of -1.605.  The percentage of people 18 years and older is 80 %. Based on Panchal et al. 2007, 
chronic pain of moderate to severe intensity occurs in 19 % of adults. 5 % use strong opioids.  Panchal et 
al. 2007 state that “Estimates of the frequency of constipation vary from 15–90% in patients receiving 
opioids for noncancer pain“. Other references, e. g. NHS 2012, Kalso et al. 2004, and Camilleri, 2011 all 
report frequencies around 40 %. 
As there is variation in the frequency of constipation reported in different studies, the frequency of 
constipation cannot be taken into account for PEC refinement. Even if only 25 % of the patients treated 
would suffer from constipation, the PEC surface water would be higher than the action limit 0.01 µg/l.  
The refined PECsurface water for the additional indication (chronic non-cancer pain) is 0.042. The resulting 
PECsurface water for Relistor is 0.043 which is higher than the action limit.  
As a result of the above considerations, the available data do not allow exclude definitively a risk of 
Methylnaltrexone bromide to the environment. 
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points to be addressed: To submit a Type II ERA. 
2.2.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The newly submitted in Vitro Human μ-, κ-, and δ-Opioid Receptor Binding Assay (MNIV0101) determines 
for the rank order of potencies M4 as being more potent than the parent compound MNTX itself. 
However, as per data previously submitted, the ratio of total (AUCmetabolite/AUCparent) systemic exposures 
of the most abundant metabolites relative to the parent compound (223 ng·h/mL) at steady state were 
approximately 29.3% for M2, 18.8% for M4, and 8.7% for M5 and the lower circulating levels of M2, M4 
and M5 affirm that MNTX is the primary agent responsible for the observed pharmacological activity. The 
M2 metabolite was only weakly active as a µ-opioid receptor antagonist (1000-fold less than M4 or M5). 
In human platelet rich plasma inhibition of PAF induced platelet aggregation by 37% was observed in 
MNTX concentration of 612 µM. As the human therapeutic Cmax of 329 nM (117 ng/mL) is less than 
1/1000 of that and as the lower concentration of 0.6 µM [= 600 nM] only lead to an inhibition of 5% this 
findings are considered to be without clinical relevance. 
The influence of MNTX on several human drug transporters was investigated in an in-vitro test system 
(study (XT128007). With the exception of OCT2 no interactions were noted. OCT-related drug-drug 
interaction potential is already reflected in the SmPC.

2.2.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No additional non-clinical studies were necessary in support of the new indication. Therefore the newly 
submitted studies add only to the completeness of the data package. Dosing schedule and drug exposure 
are unaffected within the change in the patient population and the wording of SmPC section 4.6 fertility, 
pregnancy and lactation and 5.3 preclinical safety data and PIL section 2 on pregnancy and lactation 
remains unchanged.  
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for further investigation: To perform a Type II ERA.

Absorption 
Study 1109 
Study 1109 was a phase 1, multiple dose, open-label study to evaluated the PK of methylnaltrexone in 
healthy adults subjects. The study included 10 male and 10 female healthy volunteers aged between 18 
and 47 years of age. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the PK profile of 12 mg MNTX and 
its M2, M4, and M5 metabolites when MNTX was administered as an SC injection once daily for seven days 
in healthy adults subjects. 
The main results of the study are shown in the following tables, showing the PK parameters for MNTX, as 
well as the three main metabolites tested:

12 mg to healthy subjects: 
Table 4:  PK parameters (man and (SD)) for MNTX and its metabolies following multiple SC doses of 
MNTX 12 mg to healthy subjects: 
No relevant accumulation of MNTX was found (accumulation index [R] = 105%) following SC dosing for 
seven consecutive days. _The accumulation factors of the metabolites M2, M4, and M5 were higher with 
116%, 125%, and 142%, but still regarded to be minimal overall. The higher accumulation factors are 
consistent with the longer half-lifes of the metabolites. 
The study concludes that MNTX was rapidly absorbed after single and multiple SC dosing with a mean Tmax 
of 0.3 hours. Time to reach peak exposure was higher for the metabolites.  
Study 105 
The study with the title “A randomised, open-label, three-period crossover study to determine the relative 
bioavailability of two oral formulations of MOA-728 and to compare the pharmacodynamics of the two oral 
formulations of MAO-728 to the subcutaneous formulation in subjects on stable methadone maintenance” 
was conducted between November 2006 and December 2006. The following results were achieved:

Table 5:   Summary of mean PK parameters for MNTX after administration of SC MNTX 0.15 mg/kg in 
subjects on stable methadone maintenance and of two oral formulations. 
The overall exposure appears to be higher in this patient population compared to HVs and OIC patients. 
There was no apparent relationship between systemic exposure to MNTX and MNTX PK parameters. 
Pharmacokinetics in the target population: 
Study 3356 
Study 3356 was the pivotal phase III study relevant for this type II variation for the extension of the 
indication. The study termed “A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group study of subcutaneous MOA-728 for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in 
subjects with chronic non-malignant pain” was conducted between August 2007 and November 2008 in 
the USA and Canada.  
During the study, blood samples were obtained at selected sites from “willing subjects” for trough and 
peak PK analysis. Two trough PK blood samples were collected before study drug administration, and 
additional peak PK blood samples were collected at baseline, at 1, 2, and 4 hours and between 6 and 12 
hours after study drug administration. 43 subjects contributed PK samples. The results are shown in the 
following table: 
Table: 5:  Summary of MNTX PK parameters following a single SC dose (Day 1) in subjects with OIC. 
A daily administration dose in the target population did not lead to higher exposure (per day) compared 
to every other day administration. These results compared well to the exposure seen in healthy 
volunteers.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Methylnaltrexone bromide is a selective antagonist of opioid binding at the µ-receptor. In vitro studies 
have shown methylnaltrexone bromide to be a µ-opioid receptor antagonist (inhibition constant [Ki] = 
28 nM), with 8-fold less potency for kappa opioid receptors (Ki = 230 nM) and much reduced affinity for 
delta opioid receptors.  
As a quaternary amine, the ability of methylnaltrexone bromide to cross the blood-brain barrier is 
restricted. This allows methylnaltrexone bromide to function as a peripherally acting mu-opioid 
antagonist in tissues such as the gastrointestinal tract, without impacting opioid-mediated analgesic 
effects on the central nervous system. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The MAH has provided additional PK from 3 studies. Two (2) of these studies were dedicated PK studies, 
documenting PK in healthy volunteers. The third study presents the data from the PK investigations 
included in the pivotal phase 3 study for the extension of the indication to the non-malignant pain OIC 
population. Studies MNTX 1303 and 1304 were already submitted within the initial marketing 
authorisation and do not provide additional information. 
The PK study in healthy volunteers tested single- and multiple-dose PK for the fixed dose proposed (12 
mg SC). Peak and mean exposures, Tmax and t ½ values were in the expected ranges. A relevant 
accumulation of the mother compound could be excluded with the minimal accumulation documented 
and, considering the half-lives of all four compounds being investigated (5.43 (MNTX), 6.08 (M2), 7.79 
(M4), and 8.36 (M5) hours) it can be assumed that steady state had been reached by day 7. Pre-dose 
concentration values at Day 7 and 24 hours after last dosing did not indicate further accumulation either. 
Based on the observed concentrations, and the known activity of the metabolites at the µ-receptor (based 
on Ki), the metabolites would not contribute more than 30% of the total activity of the compound. 
The sparse PK sampling from OIC patients did not reveal relevant deviations in PK in the target 
population.  
In patients with methadone treatment plasma levels (peak and total extent of exposure) appeared to be 
slightly higher and the t ½ increased compared to healthy volunteers and the target population (study 
105). However there was a marked overlap in range of the PK values across studies and MTNX kinetics 
was not dependent on methadone exposure, making a PK interaction unlikely.  
In contrast to the posology for patients with advanced illness a fixed single dose for all patients (12 mg) 
regardless of the body weight is proposed. During the procedure the MAH presented data from 8 PK 
studies conducted with various doses of MNTX with dose normalisation to a fixed 12 mg dose, or the 0.15 
mg/kg dose, and then compared Cmax and AUC showing that there are only insignificant differences 
between the fixed dose and the body-weight related doses in weight categories above and under 60 kg. 
Only a slightly higher exposure of patients with less than 60 kg of body weight with the fixed dose could 
be shown. The CHMP therefore supports the proposed administration of a fixed dose of 12 mg. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The presentation of the additional data does support the proposed administration of a fixed dose of 12 
mg. Respective PK investigations have been performed with healthy volunteers and in patients and do 
show adequate exposure in the patients.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Study 2101 
Study 2101 was a double-blind, randomised, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, phase 2, 
hypothesis-generating study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of MNTX in patients who 
experienced OIC during rehabilitation after orthopaedic procedures.  
Eligible patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive QD SC injections of either MNTX (12 mg) or 
placebo for up to four or seven days. The efficacy objectives of this study were to evaluate the activity of 
SC MNTX 12 mg in male and female patients with OIC following orthopaedic surgery. 
All efficacy endpoints were considered secondary. The proportion of patients who had an RFBM within two 
hours after the first dose of study medication was significantly higher in the MNTX group than in the 
placebo group (33% in the MNTX group versus no patients in the placebo group [p<0.05]). Similarly, a 
significantly greater proportion of the patients in the MNTX group had an RFBM within four hours after the 
first dose of study drug, compared to that in the placebo group (39% in the MNTX group versus 7% in the 
placebo group [p<0.05]). In addition, there was a more rapid time to first RFBM for patients treated with 
MNTX than for those treated with placebo, with a median time to first RFBM of 15.8 hours for the MNTX 
group versus 50.9 hours for the placebo group (p<0.05). 
2.4.2.  Main study 
Study 3200K1-3356WW: A multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, 
parallel-group study of subcutaneous MOA-728 for the treatment of opioid-induced 
constipation in subjects with chronic non-malignant pain 
Methods 
Study participants 
Subjects included had to have a history of chronic pain with non-malignant condition, of at least 2 months 
duration, taking opioids for at least 1 month and have a history of constipation for at least 1 month. The 
inclusion criteria were resembling the Rome III criteria for chronic constipation, although not completely 
similar. Relevant medical diagnoses were exclusion criteria. 
Treatments 
Eligible subjects who signed an ICF entered a 14-day (+ 2-day visit window) screening period, during 
which objective evidence of constipation was assessed. Subjects who remained eligible at the baseline 
visit were randomly assigned to receive daily injections containing placebo, MOA-728 12 mg daily (QD), 
or MOA-728 12 mg every other day (QOD) in a 1:1:1 allocation ratio. Subjects participated in a treatment 
period for up to 84 days including 4 weeks of double-blind QD or QOD treatment followed by 8 weeks of 
open-label PRN dosing. In the open-label phase, all subjects received MOA-728 12 mg. The study 
included a 14-day posttreatment follow-up period. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of SC MOA-728 
versus placebo in subjects with chronic nonmalignant pain who have OIC.  
Assessment report  
EMA/300379/2015  
Page 16/46 
 
 
 
 
The secondary objective of the study was to explore subject-reported outcomes for benefits of treatment 
with MOA-728. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The finally evaluated endpoints according to Protocol Amendment II were the following: 
- 
- 
The proportion of subjects having a RFBM within 4 hours of the first dose 
The percentage of active injections resulting in any RFBM within 4 hours during the double-blind 
phase. To qualify as a RFBM, the BM could not have occurred within 24 hours after rescue laxative 
administration. 
The two key secondary efficacy endpoints were the following: 
- 
- 
The time to the first RFBM after the first injection, censored at 24 hours or time of the second 
injection, whichever occurred first 
The change in weekly number of RFBMs from baseline to the double-blind phase. 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints included the following: 
The weekly RFBM rate (other than in the DB phase), the proportion of subjects achieving at least 3 RFBMs 
per week, the percentage of active injections resulting in any RFBM within 1,2,3,4, and 6 hours, the 
percentage of (any) injections resulting in any RFBM within 1,2,4, and 6 hours, the proportion of subjects 
with a weekly RFBM rate of three or more and an increase of at least 1 FBM from baseline, the proportion 
of subjects with an increase of at least 1 in the weekly RFBM rate from baseline, the weekly BM rate, the 
weekly number of “quality RFBMs, i.e. the RFBMs with stool quality other than diarrhoea (BSFS 1-5), the 
weekly number of complete RFBMs (=with a sense of complete evacuation), the average BSFS, the 
average straining scale of RFBMs, the proportion of subjects with improvement in BSFS by 1 degree, the 
proportion of subjects with improvement in straining scale of RFBMs by 1 degree, the proportion of RFBMs 
with BSFS 3 or 4, with those classified as diarrhoea or watery, those with Straining Scale of 0 or 1, the 
percentage of RFBMs with sensation of complete evacuation, pain intensity scale, and others. 
Subject-reported outcomes were measured by the PAC-QoL, the PAC-SYM, the EQ-5D and the WPAI. 
Sample size 
Approximately 470 subjects (157 subjects per treatment group) were to be enrolled in this study. The 
sample size estimation was based on the 2 co-primary endpoints and the 2 key secondary efficacy 
endpoints. Three (3) comparisons for the 2 co-primary endpoints were performed sequentially. A 
comparison between the combined MOA-728 groups (MOA-728 QD 12 mg and MOA-728 QOD 12 mg) and 
the placebo group was performed first using 2-sided Chi-square test for the first co-primary endpoint. If 
the p-value was less than 5%, then a comparison between MOA-728 12 mg QD and placebo for the 
second co-primary endpoint was performed. If that p-value was less than 5%, then a comparison 
between MOA-728 12 mg QOD and placebo for the second co-primary endpoint was performed. Two 
(2)-sided t-test was used for the second co-primary endpoint. A similar procedure was applied to the two 
key secondary endpoints, using 2-sided log-rank test or ANOVA (for the first and second key secondary 
endpoint, respectively). For the open label phase, only descriptive statistics are provided and no 
inferential analyses were performed. Missing efficacy data were imputed using the LOCF method as 
appropriate. Two (2) analyses were carried out based on observed data and the imputed data. The 
analyses based on the LOCF data were considered as the primary results.

Randomisation 
A central computerised randomisation/enrolment (CORE II) system was used to assign randomisation 
numbers. Each subject’s randomisation number was obtained by using the Web-based central 
randomisation system, which was available 24 hours a day. The randomisation number and the date on 
which the randomisation number was assigned were recorded on the CRF. Once subject numbers, 
package numbers, and randomisation numbers were assigned, they were not reassigned. 
Blinding (masking) 
Upon successful completion of the screening criteria and at baseline, subjects were randomly assigned to 
blinded doses of SC MOA-728 (12 mg) QD, MOA-728 (12 mg) QOD, or matching placebo in a 1:1:1 
allocation ratio for the first 4 weeks (day 1 through day 28). For the double-blind phase, test article was 
packaged in individual vials containing MOA-728 (12 mg) or placebo. A qualified designee at the study 
site assigned, recorded, and dispensed boxes of double-blind test article to the subjects. 
Statistical methods 
The primary population analysed for efficacy analyses was the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) 
population, defined as subjects who were randomised and received at least one dose of double-blind test 
article. Analyses from the open-label phase were based on all subjects who received at least one dose of 
test article in the open-label phase. 
The 2 co-primary efficacy endpoints are: (1) the proportion of subjects having a RFBM within 4 hours of 
the first dose administration, and (2) the percentage of active injections resulting in any RFBM within 4 
hours during the double-blind phase. 
Three (3) comparisons for the 2 co-primary endpoints were performed sequentially. A comparison 
between the combined MOA-728 groups (MOA-728 QD 12 mg and MOA-728 QOD 12 mg) and the placebo 
group was performed first using 2-sided Chi-square test for the first co-primary endpoint. If the p-value 
was less than 5%, then a comparison between MOA-728 12 mg QD and placebo for the second co-primary 
endpoint was performed. If that p-value was less than 5%, then a comparison between MOA-728 12 mg 
QOD and placebo for the second co-primary endpoint was performed. Two (2)-sided t-test was used for 
the second co-primary endpoint. 
The 2 key secondary efficacy endpoints were: (1) time to the first RFBM after the first injection, censored 
at 24 hours or time of the second injection, whichever occurs first, and (2) change in weekly number of 
RFBMs from baseline to the double-blind phase. 
Three (3) comparisons were performed for the 2 key secondary efficacy endpoints if all 3 comparisons for 
the 2 co-primary endpoints have p-values less than 0.05. A comparison (MOA-728 QD/QOD dose groups 
combined versus placebo) was performed using 2-sided log-rank test for the first key secondary efficacy 
endpoint. Comparisons between the MOA-728 QD dose group and placebo and between the MOA-728 
QOD dose group and placebo were performed for the endpoint of change in weekly number of RFBMs from 
baseline during the double-blind phase, using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment 
as a factor and baseline weekly RFBMs as a covariate. Hochberg Method was used to control the type 1 
error at 0.05 level for these 3 comparisons. 
The distribution of time to the first RFBM after the first injection, censored at 24 hours or time of the 
second injection, whichever occurs first, was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.

Recruitment 
Study Start Date: August 2007 
Study Completion Date: December 2008 
Conduct of the study 
The protocol was amended twice after the original protocol was issued on 04 Jun 2007. 
Amendment 1 (25 Sep 2007): Overall this amendment resulted in: increase in sample size, changes in 
primary endpoints and in several study procedures.  The change in the primary endpoint to a co-primary 
endpoint led to a revised sample size calculation to ensure that the study was powered appropriately. 
Amendment 2 (05 Aug 2008): Overall this amendment re-ordered the efficacy endpoints to be consistent 
with the endpoints in the pivotal phase 3 studies of MOA-728 for the treatment of OIC in patients with 
advanced illness who were receiving palliative care.  In addition, minor and nonsubstantial changes were 
made to clarify a number of ambiguities in the protocol.  Amendment 2 was implemented prior to the end 
of enrollment and did not result in a change in the required number of subjects or study procedures. 
Baseline data 
Demographic and baseline characteristics of subjects in the safety population during the double-blind 
phase are presented in Table 8-4.  The results show that the 3 treatment groups were well balanced at 
study entry. The safety population during the double-blind phase consisted of more women (60.2%) than 
men (39.8%) with a mean age of 48.79 years. The majority of subjects were white (89.8%) and 
non-Hispanic/Latino (94.1%). As expected for a population with chronic pain and symptomatic OIC, most

of the subjects in the double-blind phase reported back pain (60.4%) as the primary pain condition at 
study entry.  The mean duration of OIC among subjects in the safety population was 75.7 months: 76.4 
months for subjects in the MOA-728 QD dose group, 76.1 months for subjects in the MOA-728 QOD dose 
group, and 74.5 months for subjects in the placebo group. 
The median baseline dose of opioid medication was 160.0 mg/day in the overall safety population, which 
is expressed as oral morphine equivalents.

Demographic and baseline characteristics of the subjects in the safety population during the open-label 
phase were consistent with those in the double-blind phase 
Numbers analysed 
A total of 460 subjects were randomised and received treatment in the double-blind phase of the study 
including: 150 subjects in the MOA-728 QD treatment group, 148 in the MOA-728 QOD treatment group, 
and 162 in the placebo treatment group.  Efficacy analyses were performed on all 460 subjects in the 
mITT population.  
A total of 364 subjects received at least 1 dose of open-label treatment.  The majority of subjects with OIC 
who entered the open-label phase had chronic back pain (60.2%) as the primary pain condition requiring 
symptomatic opioid-therapy. 
Protocol violation was the reason for not completing the study for 21 (4.6%) subjects in the double-blind 
and 21 (5.8%) in the open-label phases. The most common reasons for protocol violations resulting in 
discontinuation were noncompliance of reporting diary information through IVRS, noncompliance with 
laxative use, and subjects who entered the study and did not meet baseline inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoints 
The proportion of patients with an RFBM within four hours after the first dose (the first of two co-primary 
endpoints) was significantly higher in the MNTX-treated patients than in the placebo patients (34% 
versus 10%, respectively; p<0.001).

The percentage of active injections resulting in an RFBM within four hours after dosing through the 
four-week double-blind period (the second co-primary endpoint) was calculated using all the injections 
from the MNTX QD group but only the active injections from the MNTX QOD group. Results for this 
endpoint were calculated using daily injections for MNTX versus daily injections for placebo for the MNTX 
QD group; however, for the MNTX QOD group, the QOD injections of active drug were only compared 
against the corresponding QOD injections of placebo drug. 
The calculated percentage was 29% and 30% for the MNTX QD and MNTX QOD dose regimens, 
respectively, compared with 9% for each corresponding placebo regimen (p<0.001 for each comparison) 
during the four-week, double-blind period, as shown in Figure 1.

Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Time to first RFBM 
Figure 2 provides a graphic display of the Kaplan-Meier analysis for time to the first RFBM within 24 hours 
after the first dose of treatment.  The difference in time to the first RFBM following first dose is statistically 
significant based on the log-rank test (p<0.001) for the combined MNTX treatment group versus placebo.  
The separation between the MNTX-treated patients and the placebo group occurs quickly after dose 
administration and increases up to four hours after dosing point (Figure 2).  Little additional 
differentiation between MNTX and placebo treatment occurs after four hours, but the difference between 
the groups seen up to four hours after dosing persisted throughout the 24-hour time period.  Among

patients who had an RFBM within four hours after the first dose, the median time to an RFBM was 0.8 
hours in the MNTX- treated patients and 2.4 hours in the placebo group. 
The median times to the first RFBM after the first dose of treatment were 22.1 hours in the MNTX QD 
group, 28.1 hours in the MNTX QOD group, and 48.9 hours in the placebo group (p<0.001 for each 
comparison).

Change in weekly number of RFBMs 
Increase from baseline in average weekly RFBMs, the second key secondary endpoint, was significantly 
higher in the MNTX QD and QOD groups compared with the placebo group for the four-week period 
(p<0.001 and p=0.011, respectively).

During the open-label phase of the study, patients were allowed to reduce the number of injections, and 
did so by injecting between 4 and 5 doses per week consistent over all former treatment groups. The 
evaluation of the clinical endpoints, consisting of the mean percentage of injections resulting in any RFBM 
within 4 hours, the mean number of RFBM per week and the number of CRFBMs per week showed a 
constant difference compared to baseline, without strong changes over time.

Supportive studies 
Study 3358 was a multi-centre, open-label, phase 3 study in patients with non-cancer pain and OIC 
conducted at 120 investigational sites in the USA, Canada, Australia, Spain, Korea, and Colombia. The 
study was conducted between December 2008 and September 2010. 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of the SC MNTX 
12 mg administration in this patient population. The secondary objective of the study was to assess the 
long-term efficacy of the SC MNTX administration. 
The study consisted of a 2 week screening period, a 48-week open-label treatment period, and a 2-week 
post-treatment follow-up. The dosing during the 48-week period was 12 mg MNTX SC administered daily, 
which could be adjusted to an as needed basis with a minimum does of 1 per week. 
In- and exclusion criteria were resembling those of the double-blind study. The efficacy measurements 
included the following: The percentage of injections resulting in BM within 4 hours, the average of BM 
Bristol Stool Scale, the average of BM Straining Scale and the average percentage of BMs with a sensation 
of complete evacuation. 
A total of 1673 subjects were screened, of which 1040 were assigned to treatment, and 1034 were 
randomised. Of these, 477 completed the whole duration of the trial. Of the 54% discontinuations of the 
study, 15% discontinued due to AEs, 12.7% due to subject request, and 9.3% “failed to return”. 8.2% 
had protocol violations, 4.4% unsatisfactory efficacy response, and 2.8% other reasons. 4 subjects 
(0.4%) died during the trial. 
The mean percentage of injections resulting in BMs within 4 hours was 34% without relevant fluctuation 
across the duration of the study, the weekly BM rate was a mean of 3.9, the percentage of BMs with a 
sense of complete evacuation was about 55%, and the average BFSF of BMs was 3.6, again without 
relevant fluctuation in all these parameters. 
Study 3201 was a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, evaluated the safety 
and efficacy of an oral MNTX tablet formulation versus placebo in subjects with chronic nonmalignant pain 
with OIC.  Subjects were randomly assigned to receive oral MNTX 150, 300, or 450 mg once daily (QD), 
or placebo QD in a 1:1:1:1 allocation ratio.  Subjects took study drug QD during the first 28 days; dosing 
was as needed during the remaining 56 days of the 12 week treatment period. MNTX was supplied as 150 
mg tablets; all patients took 3 tablets per day of study drug and/or placebo to maintain the blind. Study 
drug was ingested first thing in the morning on an empty stomach (prior to breakfast).  A total of 803 
subjects with OIC and chronic, non-cancer pain were enrolled, randomised to 1 of 4 treatment groups, 
and received ≥ 1 dose of study medication (201, 201, and 200 subjects in the 150, 300, and 450 mg/day 
groups, respectively, and 201 in the placebo group). 
The primary endpoint for study 3201 was the average percentage of RFBMs per subject within 4 hours of 
all doses during the first 4 weeks of dosing.  This endpoint was the same as the second of the co-primary 
endpoints in the pivotal study of SC MNTX (3356) in patients with OIC associated with noncancer pain. 
For the primary endpoint, highly statistically significant improvements were observed for the MNTX 300 
and 450 mg/day groups compared to the placebo group in the ITT population (p = 0.0016 and p < 0.0001, 
respectively).  Dose-dependent increases in primary endpoint responses were observed across increasing 
MNTX dose levels (p < 0.0001 for linear dose response; 18.2%, 21.1%, 24.6%, and 27.4% of subjects in 
the placebo, 150, 300, and 450 mg/day groups, respectively, had RFBMs within 4 hours of all doses 
during Weeks 1 through 4). 
Comparison of an equivalent endpoint (average percentage of RFBMs per subject within 4 hours of dosing 
during the treatment period) between oral dosing in study 3201 (primary endpoint) and SC dosing in 
Assessment report

study 3356 (second of the co-primary endpoints) indicated consistent, statistically significant efficacy of 
MNTX across studies (3356 results – see section 3.2.1.2; 3201 results – presented above). 
Results for the key secondary efficacy endpoints are the following: 
• 
There were significant greater increases from baseline in the weekly number of RFBMs over the 
first four weeks of dosing in the MNTX 300  and 450 mg/day groups compared with the placebo group (p 
= 0.0109 and p = 0.0083, respectively, first key secondary endpoint).  The LS mean difference versus 
placebo in the changes from baseline during Weeks 1 – 4 were 0.58 and 0.60 for the 300 and 450 mg/day 
groups, respectively. 
• 
The proportion of responders during Weeks 1 through 4 were significantly greater in the MNTX 
300 and 450 mg/day groups compared with the placebo group (p = 0.0415 and 0.0056, respectively) in 
the last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) analysis (second key secondary endpoint).  The percentages 
of responders were 47.8% and 50.5% in the MNTX 300 and 450 mg/day groups, respectively, compared 
with 37.3% in the placebo group. A responder was defined as a subject who had ≥ 3 RFBMs/week, with 
an increase of ≥ 1 RFBM/week over baseline, for ≥ 3 of the first 4 weeks of treatment. Additional 
secondary efficacy endpoints results include the following: 
Time to first RFBM: Subjects in all MNTX treatment groups had significantly shorter times to first RFBM 
compared to placebo (p = 0.0160 for the 150 mg/day group and p < 0.0001 for each of the 300 and 
450 mg/day groups).  Also, significantly higher proportions of MNTX-treated subjects had RFBMs within 4 
hours (p < 0.0001 for each of the 300 and 450 mg/day doses) and within 24 hours (p = 0.0193, p = 
0.0002, and p < 0.0001 for the 150, 300, and 450 mg/day doses, respectively) following the first dose of 
study drug when compared with placebo-treated subjects. 
Durable efficacy:  Efficacy of MNTX, with respect to the average percentage of RFBMs within four hours of 
dosing (primary efficacy variable), was durable over the course of the 12 week treatment period. 
• 
In MNTX to placebo comparisons at each week, there were significant (p < 0.05) treatment 
differences in primary endpoint responses compared to placebo at most time points for the 300 and 450 
mg/day groups from Week 1 up to Week 12 of the study. 
• 
In MNTX to placebo comparisons over the entire 3 month period, there were significant 
improvements in primary endpoint responses in the 300 mg/day and 450 mg/day groups. 
The proportions of primary endpoint responses over the entire treatment period was 25% and 28% for 
the MNTX 300 and 450 mg/day groups, respectively, and 19% for the placebo group (p = 0.0020 and p 
< 0.0001, respectively). 
• 
A durable MNTX treatment effect was observed in the proportions of overall responders during 
the 12 week treatment period; there were significantly greater proportions of responders for ≥ 9 of 12 
weeks in the 450 mg/day MNTX group versus placebo.  A total of 41%, 40%, and 49% of subjects were 
overall responders for the MNTX 150, 300, and 450 mg/day groups, respectively (p = 0.0006 for the 450 
mg/day group versus placebo). Responders were defined as subjects with ≥ 3 RFBMs per week and an 
increase of ≥ 1 from baseline (second key secondary efficacy variable), and overall responders were 
responders for ≥ 9 of 12 weeks (ie, ≥ 75% of the weeks). 
The effectiveness of oral MNTX led to significantly less days requiring rescue laxatives in the 450 mg/day 
group when compared to placebo in this study.  The percentage of total study days requiring rescue 
laxative therapy were 6.20% in the placebo group and 4.27% in the MNTX 450 mg/day group (p = 
0.0253).

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The MAH has presented a phase II study randomised, placebo-controlled study of short-term use of MNTX 
(study 2101) conducted in patients with OIC after orthopaedic surgery. A treatment duration of at least 
seven days was expected. The endpoints used for efficacy evaluation were the induction of prompt 
laxation after certain time-points, and the time to laxation events, indicating pharmacodynamic activity. 
From this study, it can be concluded that the compound does develop a relevant pharmacodynamic 
activity and might be suitable for longer-term treatment of patients with OIC. 
The pivotal phase III study (study 3356) in support of the proposed treatment of the new patient 
population of patients with non-malignant pain suffering from opioid-induced constipation included a 
study population receiving opioids and suffering from constipation induced by this medication for longer 
periods of time (at least one month at screening). The study was designed as a placebo-controlled study 
with four weeks duration, comparing 12 mg SC MNTX OD, and 12 mg SC QOD with placebo in a double 
blind manner for four weeks. An additional open-label treatment phase of 8 weeks was also included. The 
overall study design with a run-in period for the evaluation of the fulfilment of the inclusion criteria, and 
the randomisation, and double-blind treatment phase is considered acceptable. The 4 week treatment 
period (in double-blind fashion) can be considered sufficient in this setting taking into consideration that 
Relistor is already authorised in the advanced illness population (mostly cancer patients). 
The treatment groups of the double-blind phase of the trial were reasonably balanced. The mean age was 
49 years, and the majority of the patients (60.2%) were female. The duration of opioid induced 
constipation was around 75 months in the mean, with no relevant deviations between the groups. 
Concomitant treatment with “usual laxatives” was to be discontinued before inclusion in the study which 
is also reflected in the non-cancer patients in the SmPC (section 4.2). 
The majority of patients (88%) in Study 3356 were constipated at study entry while taking one or more 
laxatives. The “validation” of the “insufficient response to laxatives” was only done by history taking, 
which is not defining a clear “insufficient response”-population but most likely include a relatively 
heterogeneous population comprising partial responders to “null-responders”. During the run-in period of 
study 3356, no “background medication” was given (in order to ascertain the insufficient response to 
laxatives) but only rescue medication could be used. It is therefore considered that the included patient 
population do only slightly differ from the clear second line indication and that efficacy was assessed in 
this setting. To address this concern the MAH agreed to amend the indication to second line (when 
response to usual laxative therapy has not been sufficient) in accordance with the already existing 
indication in the advanced illness population. Since the pharmacodynamic action of a µ-receptor 
antagonist does not depend on the reason why the opioid is given, the indication statement was 
summarised to the treatment of OIC when response to usual laxative therapy has not been sufficient in 
adult patients. The posology remains separated for the different patient populations due to the potential 
differences regarding efficacy and safety, the doses used in the underlying studies, and the different 
background medication. 
The number of discontinuations was high during the double-blind, as well as during the open-label phase 
of the study, with more than 30% of the patients discontinuing the study within 3 months. Furthermore 
– during the double-blind phase – the number of drop-outs has been considerably higher in the active 
treatment groups compared to placebo. To give assurance on external validity of the study as a selected 
patient population could have introduced bias, especially towards the end of the evaluation period, and to 
account for a differential drop-out additional sensitivity analyses were presented showing a minor 
influence of the differential drop-out on the overall outcome of the trial.

The company has additionally conducted a long-term open-label study with one year duration. This study 
evaluated efficacy as a secondary objective. Notwithstanding the discontinuation rate, which was high 
across the whole duration of the trial and might have led to a “positive” selection of patients with good 
treatment response and without tolerability problems, the results indicated relevant changes from 
baseline which were sustained during the whole treatment period.  
The company had chosen in the development program to use mainly primary and secondary endpoints 
expressing an immediate clinical activity (within certain time-points in close relation to study drug 
administration). It is considered that induction of laxation within an early point of time after 
administration needs to relate well to the increase in overall frequency of laxation, the (change of the) 
consistency of the stool, and, after all, the complaints associated with the bowel movements, such as a 
feeling of completeness of evaluation, straining, and other pain- and non-pain related symptoms to be of 
clinical relevance. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The evaluation of the pivotal study has shown a high numerical and statistically significant superiority of 
the active treatment groups over placebo in the two co-primary and the key secondary endpoints. These 
effects appear to be consistent across the whole double-blind treatment period. These results are 
supported by the evaluation of the PAC-SYM, and the PAC-QOL, both general questionnaires for the 
evaluation of gastrointestinal symptoms in constipation and the related quality of life. 
Whereas primary and secondary endpoints expressing an immediate clinical activity (within an early point 
of time after administration) are not considered to measure a clinical meaningful effect they were 
complemented by further secondary endpoints and analysis expressing more targeted clinical relevance.  
The proportion of patients with ≥3 RFBMs per week during the 4-week double-blind phase was 59% of the 
patients in the group receiving daily methylnaltrexone 12 mg (p<0.001 vs. placebo), in 61% of those 
receiving it every other day (p<0.001 vs. placebo), and in 38% of the placebo treated patients. 
Supplementary analysis evaluated the percentage of patients achieving ≥3 complete RFBMs per week 
and an increase of ≥1 complete RFBM per week in at least 3 of the 4 treatment weeks. This was achieved 
in 28.7% of the patients in the group receiving daily methylnaltrexone 12 mg (p<0.001 vs. placebo), in 
14.9% of those receiving it every other day (p=0.012 vs. placebo), and in 6.2% of the placebo treated 
patients. 
Whereas an ideal measure of looking into clinical efficacy is regarded to be an endpoint combining 
increase in overall frequency of laxation, the (change of the) consistency of the stool, and, after all, the 
complaints associated with the bowel movements, such as a feeling of completeness of evaluation, 
straining, and other pain- and non-pain related symptoms, setting certain thresholds for the fulfilment of 
a treatment response the MAH was able to show consistent effects in most of these other more “relevant” 
domains of efficacy,  
In the lower dose group the numerical values and rates of responders were reduced compared with the 
high dose group (and the differences to placebo were reduced). For some of these endpoints, the lower 
dose did not reach statistical significance pointing to a diminished effect. Considering the recommended 
posology (as needed, given as at least 4 doses weekly) this does not pose a concern. 
Consistency of results across different population subgroups was shown for different underlying pain 
condition, baseline severity of constipation, and baseline opioid dose. Consistency was also shown for 
age, gender, race, and body weight but to a lesser extent.

The open-label phase of the study has shown consistency with regard to the results achieved in the 
primary and secondary endpoints used in the double-blind phase and a clear tendency for a reduced 
effect over time could not be anticipated. To draw reliable conclusions from an open-label extension 
phase on the long term persistence of efficacy is difficult but it is taken into consideration that the results 
of the open-label extension and the long-term safety study demonstrate overall consistent effects over 
time - not showing any reduction in effects in the long-term. Moreover, the applicant presented in the 
course of the procedure data from a 3-months study in OIC with an oral formulation of MNTX (dose: 450 
mg), which did show consistent superiority over placebo for the duration of three months. Considering the 
overall pharmacology of the substance, it can be assumed that the efficacy shown in the 4-weeks trial 
persists for longer treatment periods. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Clinical relevance and durability of the effect in the studied patient population has been shown to a 
sufficient extend. Despite somewhat diminished efficacy in the lower dose group the recommended 
posology given as at least 4 doses weekly is acceptable as it can be increased to up to 7 doses weekly if 
needed. 
Considering that the patients included in the pivotal trial comprising a population of partial responders to 
“null-responders” and efficacy was assessed in this setting the indication statement was adapted to 
reflect a second line treatment. 
Since the pharmacodynamic action of a µ-receptor antagonist does not depend on the reason why the 
opioid is given and consistency of results was shown across different population subgroups, the indication 
statement was summarised to the treatment of OIC when response to usual laxative therapy has not been 
sufficient in adult patients. 
However, due to the potential differences with regard to efficacy and safety, the doses used in the 
underlying studies, and the different background medication, a simple single posology could not be 
introduced. This has still to differentiate between the overall pain population and the palliative care 
population studied for the initial licensing. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The known safety profile of the compound can be regarded to be relatively “benign”, acting primarily on 
the gastrointestinal tract. The most frequent undesirable effects are diarrhoea, abdominal pain, 
flatulence, nausea and vomiting. In addition, frequently observed events include dizziness, and injection 
site reactions.

Table 18: Number (%) of subjects with TEAEs reported in ≥2% in double-blind phase, study 3356 
No new safety signals were identified in an analysis of SC MNTX-treated patients for TEAEs of special 
interest that are related to study drug (TEAEs of special interest include all preferred terms [PTs] in the 
System Organ Classes [SOCs] of cardiac and hepatobiliary disorders and specific selected other events 
such as GI perforation, dehydration, and hypotension).  The incidence of related TEAEs of special interest 
was low in both SC pools (≤3%) and was similar to the placebo group. The most commonly reported 
related TEAEs of special interest included palpitations (three patients, MNTX) in the SC double-blind pool, 
and hypotension (seven patients) and QT prolongation (six patients) in the SC MNTX-only pool 
(open-label period). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No deaths occurred among the 316 MNTX-treated patients in the SC double-blind pool, and four deaths 
(none related to study drug) occurred among the 1484 patients in the SC MNTX-only pool. 
Assessment report  
EMA/300379/2015  
Page 36/46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At least one SAE was reported by nine patients (2%) (six MNTX QD, one MNTX QOD, and two placebo) in 
the SC double-blind pool and by 114 patients (9%) in the SC MNTX-only pool. Related SAEs were reported 
by one patient (MNTX QOD group) in the double-blind period in Study 3356 (Module 5.3.5.3, ISS, section 
3.6.2), by no patients in the open-label period in Study 3356, and by four patients in Study 3358. 
The observed SAE incidence in the SC pools did not raise any safety concerns regarding the long-term use 
of SC MNTX at a fixed dose of 12 mg in patients with non-cancer pain and OIC. 
Laboratory findings 
Overall, no difference was seen between SC MNTX and placebo in the incidence of TEAEs related to 
potentially clinically significant values for laboratory tests, vital sign evaluations, or electrocardiogram 
assessments. 
Safety in special populations 
An analysis of potential withdrawal symptoms was performed. Table 8 provides a summary of 
treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) by age group during the double blind phase of 3356 and presents 
evaluation results with and without the GI-related events. 
Table 9 provides a summary TEAEs by age group for the long term methylnaltrexone treated phase 
population (3356 and 3358) also with and without GI related events.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The most commonly reported TEAEs that led to permanent discontinuation of study drug among the 
MNTX-treated patients in the SC pools were in the GI disorders SOC and the PT hyperhidrosis, consistent 
with the known safety profile of MNTX. 
Post marketing experience 
MNTX is authorised in the EU since July 2008 in the treatment of opioid induced constipation in advanced 
illness adult patients when response to usual laxative therapy has not been sufficient. In the last PSUR 
covering the period from 28th March 2013 to 27th March 2014 no actions were considered necessary due 
to safety reasons. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The clinical safety of the compound has been documented with the conduct of two studies, one with a 
4-week double-blind design, followed by 8 weeks of open-label treatment, and with a long-term one year 
“pure” open-label safety study. The safety in the new patient population has been documented in a 
considerable number of patients, which encompasses 316 patients in double-blind treatments, and over 
1600 patients in open-label treatment, of which about 1300 patients were treated in a long-term study. 
Of these over 600 patients were treated for more than 6 months, and 477 patients were treated for at 
least 48 weeks. 
The safety analysis of these studies has mainly shown a confirmation of the known safety profile of the 
compound, acting primarily on the gastrointestinal tract. The analysis of these adverse events overall 
shows a similar adverse event profile compared to the one already known from the patients with 
advanced illness. 
The most frequent adverse events in total, and assessed as being causally related to the intake of the 
compound were – similar to the previously studied patient population with advanced illness and limited 
life expectancy – diarrhoea, abdominal pain, flatulence nausea and vomiting. In addition, frequently 
observed events included dizziness, and injection site reactions. In addition to the previously seen 
Assessment report  
EMA/300379/2015  
Page 38/46 
 
 
 
 
 
frequent events, hyperhidrosis was seen in this patient population more frequently than in the previous 
studies population. However, this undesirable effect was already included in the product information. 
In addition it has been derived from the analysis of the submitted studies, especially the double blind 
phase of study 3356, that there are additional adverse events that occur consistently at higher 
frequencies in the active treatment groups compared to placebo, and for which a reasonable causality can 
be assumed. These events comprise the events chills, tremor, piloerection, rhinorrhoea, hot flush, 
palpitation and hyperhidrosis which have therefore been added to 4.8 of the SmPC summarised as mild 
withdrawal-like symptoms with the frequency “common”.  
The MAH has also evaluated any development of withdrawal symptoms by the application of validated 
scales, and of the development of “breakthrough” pain during the treatment. These did not give rise for 
concern, apart from the fact that the potential withdrawal effect of perspiration was indicating a slight 
increase of this dimension of the respective withdrawal symptom scale (OOWS). This is observed to be in 
accordance to the observed higher frequency of the above mentioned withdrawal like symptoms chills, 
tremor, piloerection, rhinorrhoea, hot flush, and, of course the hyperhidrosis and “mild opioid- withdrawal 
like symptoms” was included as an identified risk into the RMP. 
There were no deaths observed during the short-term studies, and the four deaths observed during the 
long-term study could clearly not be attributed to be causally related to the intake of MNTX. Similarly, 
from the rare number of events observed being serious, no additional concerns compared to the 
previously known safety profile can be concluded. Also analysis of laboratory markers and most of the 
vital signs did also not reveal further concerns previously unknown. 
The applicant analysed the age relation of adverse events for the categories of GI disorders as a whole, 
the mild withdrawal symptoms, and for cardiovascular events which did not show a clear pattern of 
different risks for older patients. An altered risk-profile in older populations was not observed. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The data presented for the additional patient population to be treated with the compound do overall 
confirm the known safety profile of the compound. Mild “withdrawal”-like symptoms in patients taking 
opioids, have been added to 4.8 of the SmPC and were included as an identified risk into the RMP. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The annex II related to the PSUR refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 4.3 is acceptable. However, the RMP is to be 
updated with the finalised SPC wording to reflect the correct routine risk minimisation measures. The 
PRAC endorsed PRAC Rapporteur assessment report is attached. 
After inclusion of the final SmPC wordings as requested by the CHMP, the CHMP approved vs. 4.5 of the

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly (please refer to the full PI in attachment). 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet (PL) has been performed. As the 
changes proposed in this variation are deemed not to be substantial, further readability testing is not 
considered to be required. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Relistor demonstrated statistically significant and clinical relevant benefit in the non-cancer population in 
patients that had inadequate relief despite laxative use at screening prior to study entry. 
The proportion of patients with ≥3 RFBMs per week during the 4-week double-blind phase was 59% of the 
patients in the group receiving daily methylnaltrexone 12 mg (p<0.001 vs. placebo), in 61% of those 
receiving it every other day (p<0.001 vs. placebo), and in 38% of the placebo treated patients. 
Supplementary analysis evaluated the percentage of patients achieving ≥3 complete RFBMs per week 
and an increase of ≥1 complete RFBM per week in at least 3 of the 4 treatment weeks. This was achieved 
in 28.7% of the patients in the group receiving daily methylnaltrexone 12 mg (p<0.001 vs. placebo), in 
14.9% of those receiving it every other day (p=0.012 vs. placebo), and in 6.2% of the placebo treated 
patients. 
Prompt induction of laxation in non-cancer patients with OIC could be demonstrated. An increase of 
overall bowel movement frequency can also be concluded, and most of the combinations of the relevant 
symptoms did also show an improvement over the observation period of four weeks which are considered 
clinically relevant. The PAC-SYM (patient assessment of constipation symptoms), a standard scale for the 
observation of constipation and the PAC-QoL (the respective Quality of Life instrument) did also indicate 
relevant and significant changes in favour of both doses tested. 
Assessment report  
EMA/300379/2015  
Page 43/46 
 
 
 
 
 
Since the pharmacodynamic action of a µ-receptor antagonist in does not depend on the reason why the 
opioid is given findings in non-cancer patients with OIC are considered transferable to non-palliative care 
patients with cancer for the proposed fixed single dose for all patients (12 mg) regardless of the body 
weight. Accordingly the indication statement was summarised to the treatment of OIC when response to 
usual laxative therapy has not been sufficient in adult patients. Nevertheless, as patients in palliative care 
might be more vulnerable with resulting differences regarding efficacy and safety of the product the 
posology for the already granted indication was left unchanged. 
Albeit Relistor showed somewhat diminished efficacy in the lower dose group the use of the lower dose 
can be justified as applications can be increased to up to 7 doses weekly if needed. 
The open-label extension study and the open-label long-term safety study show to a sufficient extent that 
beneficial effects in comparison to baseline can be maintained.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The majority of patients (88%) in the pivotal study were constipated at study entry while taking one or 
more laxatives supporting a second line indication (when response to usual laxative therapy has not been 
sufficient) instead of the first line indication initially claimed. The uncertainty on the clinical efficacy in the 
first line indication was addressed by amending the indication to second line. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The known risks of the compound, mainly its effects on the gastrointestinal tract and associated with the 
prompt induction of laxation have been confirmed in the trials conducted for the new indication (or patient 
population). These effects mainly relate to the occurrence of effects such as abdominal pain and 
cramping, nausea, diarrhoea, flatulence, and vomiting. CNS related side effects are observed only with an 
increased rate of dizziness. In rare cases in patients with advanced illness, the compound is known to 
potentially induced gastrointestinal perforations. Further known effects are hyperhidrosis and injection 
site reactions ranging from singing, redness, and oedema to a sensation of burning pain. All these risks 
are adequately described in the product in formation and the RMP. 
Reasonable causality can be assumed for observed mild withdrawal-like symptoms like chills, tremor, 
piloerection, rhinorrhoea, hot flush, palpitation and hyperhidrosis which have therefore been added to 4.8 
of the SmPC and added to the RMP as an important identified risk.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Overall, the known and relatively benign safety profile of the compound has also been observed in the 
newly submitted studies in the new indication.

EMA/300379/2015

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Opioids are a well-established and effective therapy for patients who are receiving palliative care and 
moderate to severe non-cancer pain; however, opioids can have significant side effects, the most 
common of which is constipation. In a multi-country, longitudinal study assessing the burden of OIC in 
493 patients with NCP, 94% of patients had infrequent bowel movements and at least moderate GI 
symptoms despite laxative use, and 27% of patients experienced these symptoms despite the use of 2 or 
more laxatives. Of the 67% of patients who said they had some benefit from laxatives, 56% said they 
received little benefit from the treatment.1 In patients receiving chronic opioids for pain, uncontrolled 
symptoms of OIC can add to their discomfort and may serve as a barrier to effective pain management, 
limiting opioid dose or prompting opioid discontinuation. 
In addition to the already known side effects from the palliative care patient population mild single 
withdrawal-like symptoms have been identified as new undesirable effects having only minor clinical 
relevance. In summary Relistor has a relatively benign profile of unfavourable effects being manageable 
with the appropriate statement as inserted in the product information. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Relistor demonstrated statistically significant and clinical relevant benefit in the non-cancer population in 
adult patients that had insufficient response to usual laxative therapy. Since the pharmacodynamic action 
of a µ-receptor antagonist does not depend on the reason why the opioid is given findings in non-cancer 
patients with OIC are considered to be transferable to non-palliative care patients with cancer. 
The benefits of Relistor in addressing the disease burden of OIC weighed against its relatively benign side 
effect profile lead to a positive benefit-risk balance in the claimed indication.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends by consensus the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, 
concerning the following change: 
Variation(s) accepted 
Type 
C.I.6.a 
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of 
Type II 
a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved 
one 
Extension of Indication to include the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in non-cancer adult 
patients when response to laxative therapy has not been sufficient; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 
4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. 
This variation leads to amendments to the SmPC and Package Leaflet. 
Additional market protection 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of 
Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and considers that the new therapeutic indication brings 
significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.

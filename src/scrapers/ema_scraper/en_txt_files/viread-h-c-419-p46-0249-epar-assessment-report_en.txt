1.    INTRODUCTION 
In accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, Gilead Sciences International Limited 
(GSIL) submitted to the EMA a 72 week interim report for Study GS-US-174-0115, ‘A Randomised, 
Double-Blind Evaluation of the Antiviral Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of Tenofovir Disoproxil 
Fumarate Versus Placebo in Adolescents with Chronic Hepatitis B Infection.’ 
In December 2011, GILEAD is planning to submit a Type II variation that will seek to register a new 
paediatric indication for Viread for the treatment of adolescents with chronic hepatitis B. This will be 
based on the pivotal 72 week data presented in this ‘Article 46’ submission. 
GILEAD stated that, in accordance with Article 16(2) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the data 
submitted do not influence the benefit-risk balance for Viread 245 mg film-coated tablets and therefore 
no further regulatory action is required on the marketing authorisation for Viread 245 mg film-coated 
tablets at this time. 
2.  SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
Study GS-US-174-0115 consists of an initial 72 weeks of randomized, double-blind treatment with TDF 
300 mg or PLB once daily, followed by open-label TDF treatment, for up to a total of 4 years (through 
Week  192).  Subjects  enrolled  in  this  study  (n=106)  were  TDF-naive  adolescents  (12  to  17  years  of 
age)  with  HBeAg+  or  HBeAg−  compensated  CHB,  and  included  both  HBV-treatment  experienced  and 
treatment-naive subjects. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was HBV DNA < 400 copies/mL at Week 72. 
Risk-benefit evaluation supported use of a blinded study design using placebo (PLB) for 72 weeks as an 
appropriate  comparator.  Use  of  the  PLB  comparator  allowed  a  more  robust  evaluation  of  TDF  safety 
and tolerability (e.g., bone metabolism, renal safety), and did not expose subjects randomized to the 
PLB  group  to  the  theoretical  risk  of  developing  resistance  to  TDF  during  the  blinded  portion  of  the 
study.  Furthermore,  during  the  open-label  period,  subjects  randomized  to  PLB  are  given  open-label 
TDF which affords them access to active HBV treatment and allows for assessment of changes in safety 
and tolerability (e.g. bone metabolism, renal safety) in subjects commencing  TDF treatment at Week 
72

TDF (300-mg once daily) therapy in HBV-infected adolescents results in highly effective suppression of 
HBV DNA (84.6%. had HBV DNA <169 copies/mL at Week 72 versus 0% in placebo arm), 
normalization of ALT, and suppression of hepatic flares, even among adolescents with prior exposure 
to HBV therapies. 
The safety profile in adolescent subjects with chronic HBV infection treated with TDF was generally 
consistent with the known safety profile of TDF in adults with HBV. However, the percent increase from 
BL in lumbar spine BMD in TDF-treated subjects was less than the percent increase in lumbar spine 
BMD attained by PLB-treated subjects (4.95% in the TDF group vs. 8.14% in the PLB group, by Week 
72). 
3.  RAPPORTEUR’S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND 
RECOMMENDATION 
In accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, Gilead submitted the 72 week interim 
report for Study GS-US-174-0115, ‘A Randomised, Double-Blind Evaluation of the Antiviral Efficacy, 
Safety, and Tolerability of Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Versus Placebo in Adolescents with Chronic 
Hepatitis B Infection.’ 
Similarly to adults, VIREAD seems to be a potent drug in HBV-infected adolescents. The safety aspects, 
notably the impact on bone, will be the salient issue to be discussed in the benefit/risk assessment of 
use of VIREAD in HBV-infected adolescents. 
No benefit/risk evaluation is made at this stage. A full benefit/risk assessment will be made 
in the frame of the upcoming type II variation procedure scheduled for submission in 
December 2011.

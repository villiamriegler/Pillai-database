Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for ivacaftor, the scientific 
conclusions of PRAC are as follows:  
In view of available data on risk of occurrence of depression and related events from spontaneous reports 
in post-marketing surveillance, including in some cases a close temporal relationship and a positive de-
challenge and re-challenge, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between Ivacaftor and depression is 
at  least  a  reasonable  possibility,  mainly  when  used  in  a  combination  treatment  with  TEZ/IVA  or 
IVA/TEZ/ELX. The PRAC concluded that the product information of medicinal products containing Ivacaftor 
should be amended accordingly.  
In  view  of  available  data  on  breast-feeding  from  the  literature,  update  of  section  4.6  of  the  SmPC  is 
warranted  regarding  breast-feeding.  The  PRAC  concluded  that  the  product  information  of  products 
containing Ivacaftor should be amended accordingly. 
Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and 
grounds for recommendation. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for ivacaftor the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing ivacaftor is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

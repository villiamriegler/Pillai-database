docetaxel monotherapy. Based on review of the MAH’s 
global pharmacovigilance database, worldwide scientific 
literature, and main pharmacovigilance textbooks, and 
medical plausibility, the weighted cumulative evidence is 
sufficient to support a causal association between 
enterocolitis, including enterocolitis with fatal outcome and 
Docetaxel. Section 4.8. of the SmPC under gastrointestinal 
disorder has been accordingly updated to indicate that rare 
cases of enterocolitis, including colitis, ischemic colitis, and 
neutropenic enterocolitis, have been reported with a 
potential fatal outcome (frequency not known) and that 
rare occurrences of dehydration have been reported as a 
consequence of gastrointestinal events including 
enterocolitis and gastrointestinal perforation. 
Section 4.4. of the SmPC regarding gastrointestinal 
reactions has likewise been updated  on this respect and 
caution is recommended for patients with neutropenia, 
particularly at risk for developing gastrointestinal 
complications. Although majority of cases occurred during

the first or second cycle of docetaxel containing regimen, 
enterocolitis could develop at any time, and could lead to 
death as early as on the first day of onset. Patients should 
be closely monitored for early manifestations of serious 
gastrointestinal toxicity. 
Section 4.7. of the SmPC has been updated to reflect that 
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use 
machines have been performed. The amount of alcohol in 
this medicinal product and the side effects of the product 
may impair the ability to drive or use machines. Therefore, 
patients should be warned of the potential impact of the 
amount of alcohol and the side effects of this medicinal 
product on the ability to drive or use machines, and be 
advised not to drive or use machines if they experience 
these side effects during treatment.

Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC), and 
sections 4.4 and 4.7 of Taxotere, concentrate for 
solution for infusion SmPC to further warn about the 
risks with alcohol content in the EU PI of each 
formulation. The labelling and Package Leaflet are 
updated accordingly.

Labelling and 
labeling that Sanofi has already accepted and US package 
PL 
insert update is under review at the FDA. It is a signal 
which warns that “the intravenous chemotherapy drug 
docetaxel contains ethanol, also known as alcohol, which 
may cause patients to experience intoxication or feel drunk 
during and after treatment”. 
This announcement was not specific to Taxotere, but 
pertains to a class-labeling for docetaxel. 
Several forms of docetaxel are currently marketed, 
including generics and the brand-name products Taxotere, 
Docefrez, and Docetaxel Injection. The FDA is revising the 
labels of all docetaxel drug products to warn about this 
risk. 
Page 9/34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The docetaxel (Taxotere and Docetaxel Winthrop) one-vial 
formulation has a concentration of 20mg docetaxel per 1mL 
of solution. The 1mL solution is a 50/50 (v/v) mix of 
polysorbate 80 and anhydrous ethanol. There is 
approximately 0.395g, 1.58g, and 3.16g of ethanol per 
20mg, 80mg, and 160mg of docetaxel (Taxotere and 
Docetaxel Winthrop) one-vial formulation, respectively. 
Docetaxel (Taxotere) two-vial formulation contains a 
docetaxel concentrate vial and a solvent vial (13% (w/w) 
ethanol 95% v/v in water for injection) which are first 
mixed to obtain an intermediate solution (or premix) at 
10mg/mL. The solvent vial contains approximately 0.252g 
and 0.932g of ethanol per 20mg and 80mg of docetaxel 
(Taxotere) two-vial formulation, respectively. 
Based on review of the pharmacovigilance database, 
literature, pharmacovigilance textbooks and medical 
plausibility, the weighted cumulative evidence is: 
- Sufficient to support the presence of alcohol in the 
formulation and the risks associated with it 
- Sufficient to support the FDA labelling update for all 
docetaxel products (brand and generic). This update is 
based on the FDA class labeling.

randomized, phase III study, designed to compare disease-

primary surgery for breast cancer in high risk node 
negative patients receiving one of the following adjuvant 
combination chemotherapy regimens: TAC (Taxotere, 
doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide) or FAC (5-fluorouracil, 
doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide). At the median follow 
up time of 10 years and 5 months, TAC treated patients 
had a 16,5% reduction in the risk of relapse compared to 
those treated with FAC (hazard ratio = 0.84, 95% CI (0.65-
1.08), p=0.1646). DFS data were not statistically 
significant but were still associated with a positive trend in 
favour of TAC. At the median follow up time of 10 years 
and 5 months, TAC-treated patients had a 9% reduction in 
the risk of death compared to FAC-treated patients (hazard 
ratio = 0.91, 95% CI (0.63-1.32)).  
Safety data from GEICAM 9805 on adverse drug reactions 
persisting into the 10-year follow-up period (including 
alopecia, amenorrhoea, lymphoedema and asthenia) and 
cases of cardiac disorders which developed during the 
follow-up period have been reflected in section 4.8 of the

Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the 
MAH 
review performed by the MAH, the CHMP considered that 
the current wording on the risk of interaction with CYP3A4 
inhibitors should be strengthened to reflect that 
concomitant use of docetaxel with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors 
(e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, indinavir, 
nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin 
and voriconazole) should be avoided.  
In case of combination with CYP3A4 inhibitors, the 
occurrence of docetaxel adverse reactions may increase, as 
a result of reduced metabolism. If the concomitant use of a 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, 
clarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, 
saquinavir, telithromycin and voriconazole) cannot be 
avoided, a close clinical surveillance is warranted and a 
dose-adjustment of docetaxel may be suitable during the 
treatment with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor.

cases consistent with an increase in docetaxel toxicity that  
were reported when it was combined with ritonavir (section 
4.5). The mechanism behind this interaction is a CYP3A4 
inhibition, the main isoenzyme involved in docetaxel 
metabolism by ritonavir. In addition, based on 
extrapolation from a pharmacokinetic study with 
ketoconazole in 7 patients, section 4.5 now recommends 
considering a 50% docetaxel dose reduction if patients 
require co-administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor such 
as azole antifungals, ritonavir and some macrolides 
(clarithromycin, telithromycin). 
Moreover, section 4.8 has been updated to include acute 
respiratory distress syndrome and cases of interstitial 
pneumonia and pulmonary fibrosis sometimes fatal that 
have rarely been reported and cases of persisting alopecia. 
Cases of renal insufficiency and renal failure have also been 
reported and included in section 4.8 of the SmPC. In about 
20% of these cases there were no risk factors for acute 
renal failure such as concomitant nephrotoxic drugs and 
gastro-intestinal disorders. Finally, reference to the 
frequency of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodisplastic 
syndrome reported in association with doxetaxel when used 
in combination with other chemotherapy agents and/or 
radiotherapy has been deleted.

extension of indication of Taxotere in the adjuvant 
treatment of patients with operable breast cancer with 
positive axillary lymph nodes (EMEA/H/C/073/II/54, 
Commission Decision 5 January 2005). The primary 
objective of this parallel, nonblinded, randomized phase 3 
study was to compare disease-free survival (DFS) after 
treatment with docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin 
and cyclophosphamide (TAC) to 5 fluorouracil in 
combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (FAC) 
in operable breast cancer patients with positive axillary 
lymph nodes. The secondary objective was to compare 
overall survival (OS), toxicity, and quality of life between 
the 2 above-mentioned arms, and to evaluate pathologic 
and molecular markers for predicting efficacy. The 10-year 
follow-up visit was the last follow-up visit, occurring 120 
months after the last administration of study drugs (a 
range of 4 months was allowed, meaning that it should 
have occurred at least 116 months after the last 
administration of study drugs). 
The final analysis was performed with an actual median 
follow up of 96 months. Significantly longer disease-free 
survival for the TAC arm compared to the FAC arm was 
demonstrated. Incidence of relapses at 10 years was 
reduced in patients receiving TAC compared to those who 
received FAC (39% versus 45%, respectively) i.e. an 
absolute risk reduction by 6% (p = 0.0043). Overall 
survival at 10 years was also significantly increased with 
TAC compared to FAC (76% versus 69%, respectively) i.e.

update to sections 4.4 and 4.6 regarding the 
contraceptive measures for women and men for all 
strengths. The Package Leaflet has been updated 
accordingly. Furthermore, the expression of the 
strength for the two initially approved 20mg 
(20mg/0.5ml) and 80mg (80mg/2ml) strengths was 
amended in the SPC, labelling and package leaflet. In 
addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make 
editorial changes throughout the SPC and package

to further align with the 20mg/1ml and 80mg/4ml 
strengths. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, 
Labelling and Package Leaflet 
because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing 
infants, breast feeding must be discontinued for the 
duration of docetaxel therapy. 
Therefore, when a woman has to be treated after delivery 
of the baby, docetaxel should be prescribed due to the 
severity of the disease and a lactating woman should stop 
breastfeeding instead of not being treated with docetaxel 
and continuing breastfeeding. This is justified by the benefit 
for the treated woman compared to the benefit of 
breastfeeding. Therefore, CHMP agreed that breast-feeding 
is removed as a contraindication from SPC section 4.3.  
In accordance with the Guideline on risk assessment of 
medicinal products on human reproduction and lactation: 
from data to labelling (EMEA/CHMP/203927/2005) as well 
as taking into account that an alternative safer treatment is 
not an option and as the treatment cannot be delayed, the 
MAH considered that an absolute contraindication for 
pregnant women is not justified. The CHMP agreed to the 
removal of the contraindication for pregnant women 
justified by the therapeutic indication of docetaxel and in 
accordance with the above mentioned guideline. 
Contraceptive measures are indeed justified by the 
pharmacodynamic properties of docetaxel. Docetaxel acts 
Page 24/34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
on mitotic cells by promoting the assembly of tubulin into 
stable microtubules and inhibits theirs disassembly which 
leads to a marked decrease of free tubulin. As 
spermatogenesis occurs during adulthood, male gamete 
could bear DNA aberrations that justify several 
spermatogenetic cycles after treatment in order to 
eliminate such gametes. Furthermore, docetaxel may pass 
into seminal fluid and may have effect on the foetus. This 
risk occurs only during 7 days after treatment, which is the 
duration of full elimination of docetaxel in faeces and urine.

performed in patients receiving ketoconazole and docetaxel 
showed that the clearance of docetaxel was reduced by half 
by ketoconazole, probably because the metabolism of 
docetaxel involves CYP3A4 as a major (single) metabolic

following information was added: "Rare cases of radiation 
pneumonitis have been reported in patients receiving 
concomitant radiotherapy." 
Under "Neoplasms benign and malignant" the following was 
added: "acute myeloid leukaemia" and "myelodysplastic 
syndrome" as very rare ADRs. Further, the statement "Two 
patients were diagnosed with leukaemia at a median 
follow-up time of 55 months and one case of leukaemia 
was reported after the follow-up period. No cases of 
myelodysplactic syndrome occurred." was deleted and 
replaced by the following information: "Very rare cases of 
acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome 
have been reported in association with docetaxel when 
used in combination with other chemotherapy agents 
and/or radiotherapy".

An open-label, multicenter, randomised phase III study 
include the efficacy and safety results of the clinical 
study TAX 311, a phase III comparison of docetaxel 
and paclitaxel in patients with advanced breast 
cancer, in Section 5.1 of the Summary of Product 
Characteristics. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics 
was conducted to compare TAXOTERE monotherapy and 
paclitaxel in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in 
patients whose previous therapy should have included an 
anthracycline. A total of 449 patients were randomised to 
receive either TAXOTERE monotherapy 100 mg/m² as a 1-
hour infusion or paclitaxel 175 mg/m² as a 3-hour infusion. 
Both regimens were administered every 3 weeks.   
Without affecting the primary endpoint, Overall Response 
Rate  (32% vs 25%, p=0.10), docetaxel prolonged the 
median time to progression (24.6 weeks vs 15.6 weeks; 
p<0.01) and the median survival (15.3 months vs 12.7 
months; p=0.03). 
More grade 3/4 adverse events were observed for 
TAXOTERE monotherapy (55.4%) compared to paclitaxel

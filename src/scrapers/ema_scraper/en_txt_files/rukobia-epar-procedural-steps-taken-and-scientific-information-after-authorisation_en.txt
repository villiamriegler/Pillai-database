There was no evidence of cross-resistance to representative 
cross-resistance information based on results from 
virology study aimed at further characterization of 
HIV-1 gp120 amino acid polymorphism E202. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
agents from other antiretroviral (ARV) classes. Temsavir 
retained wild-type activity against viruses resistant to the 
INSTI raltegravir; the NNRTIs rilpivirine and efavirenz; the 
NRTIs abacavir, lamivudine, tenofovir, zidovudine and the 
PIs atazanavir and darunavir. Additionally, abacavir, 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

data 
tenofovir, efavirenz, rilpivirine, atazanavir, darunavir and 
raltegravir retained activity against site-directed mutant 
viruses with reduced temsavir susceptibility (S375M, 
M426L, or M426L plus M475I). 
No cross-resistance was observed between temsavir and 
maraviroc or enfuvirtide. Temsavir was active against 
viruses with resistance to enfuvirtide. Some CCR5-tropic, 
maraviroc-resistant, viruses showed reduced susceptibility 
to temsavir, however, there was no absolute correlation 
between maraviroc resistance and reduced sensitivity to 
temsavir. Maraviroc and enfuvirtide retained activity 
against clinical envelopes from the Phase IIa study 
(206267) that had reduced susceptibility to temsavir and 
contained S375H, M426L, or M426L plus M475I 
substitutions.  
Temsavir was active against several ibalizumab-resistant 
viruses. Ibalizumab retained activity against site-directed 
mutant viruses that had reduced susceptibility to temsavir 
(S375M, M426L, or M426L plus M475I). HIV-1 gp120 E202 
was identified as a rare treatment-emergent substitution in 
BRIGHTE that can reduce susceptibility to temsavir, and, 
depending on the sequence context of the envelope, may 
also result in reduced susceptibility to ibalizumab.

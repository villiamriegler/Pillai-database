2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Diabetes mellitus is widely recognized as one of the leading causes of death and disability globally.  The 
International Diabetes Federation (IDF) estimates that more than 371 million adults worldwide have diabetes 
and that number is projected to increase to 552 million by 2030 (IDF Diabetes Atlas 2012a; IDF Diabetes Atlas 
2012b). Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough 
insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces, resulting in hyperglycaemia.  Type 1 
diabetes mellitus (T1DM) results from pancreatic islet cell destruction most commonly by an autoimmune 
process.  It is a disorder in which circulating insulin is virtually absent, plasma glucagon is elevated, and the 
pancreatic ß cells fail to respond.  Patients are prone to developing ketoacidosis and require exogenous insulin 
replacement.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a heterogeneous disorder most commonly associated with 
insulin resistance in the presence of an associated impairment in insulin secretion.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus 
results from relative insulin deficiency, a mismatch between insulin production and insulin requirements, which 
is in contrast to the absolute insulin deficiency of patients with T1DM. Insulin is considered the most effective 
treatment to lower high blood glucose (BG) and is indicated for patients with T1DM and for patients with T2DM, 
if adequate glycaemic control cannot be achieved through diet, exercise, or other antidiabetes medication.  Tight 
glycaemic control is recommended for most patients with diabetes mellitus to reduce the risk of chronic 
complications of the disease, and insulin’s role in achieving this is well-recognized (DCCT/EDIC 2005). 
Long-acting insulin analogues, such as insulin glargine, provide smooth, peakless basal insulin profiles, resulting 
in a glycaemic profile more similar to normal physiology, potentially enabling patients to achieve normal BG 
levels.  Clinical evidence to date suggests that a long-acting insulin analogue, such as insulin glargine, may 
provide benefits over prior agents such as neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH), including reduced frequency of 
nocturnal hypoglycaemia, better fasting BG control, and improved quality of life when compared with traditional 
insulins in patients with either T1DM or T2DM (Pieber et al. 2000; Ratner et al. 2000; Rosenstock et al. 2000; 
Yki-Jarvinen et al. 2000; Schober et al. 2001). 
Insulin glargine was first authorised in the EU on 9 June 2000 under the name of Lantus. It is currently approved 
for the treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and children aged 2 years and above. 
About the product 
Abasria (LY2963016) was submitted as a biosimilar, with Lantus (insulin glargine [rDNA origin] injection) as the 
chosen reference medicinal product. The reference medicinal product has been marketed in the European Union 
for over 10 years. Lantus 100 unit / ml solution for injection was first authorised in the EU on 9 June 2000 (MA: 
EMEA/H/C/000284); the Marketing Authorisation Holder is Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH. 
The primary amino acid sequence of LY2963016 is the same as that of the active ingredient in Lantus. Abasria 
has the same pharmaceutical form and strength as Lantus. Abasria differs from the reference medicinal product 
with respect to excipients used in the formulation: zinc oxide replaces zinc chloride and Abasria uses 100% 
glycerol compared with 85% in the reference medicinal product. However, the final quantitative formulation is 
the same as that of the reference medicinal product. 
Abasria (LY2963016) is a long-acting insulin analogue administered as a subcutaneous injection for the 
treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.  It will be made available in 2 presentations: a 3 mL cartridge, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/340840/2014 
Page 8/65 
  
  
for delivery by a compatible CE-marked reusable pen injector, and also the same 3 mL cartridge sealed in a 
prefilled pen injector (KwikPen).  The pen injectors differ from those available to administer Lantus cartridges, 
but are appropriate for use with Lilly insulin cartridges. The pack sizes also differ. 
The proposed therapeutic indication and posology for LY2963016 are identical to those for Lantus. 
The development programme 
The clinical development programme of LY2963016 has specifically considered the EU guidelines for similar 
biological medicinal products and also indication-specific guidelines (see list below).

Phase 1 clinical trial design 
Although the planning phase of the clinical development programme was completed before the draft guideline 
on similar biological medicinal products containing recombinant human insulin and insulin analogues 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/2005) was published, the clinical programme is broadly in accordance with the 
principles of this document. During the development of LY2963016 the applicant sought scientific advice at the 
European Medicines Agency (EMA) in July 2011. The scientific advice procedures covered questions on the 
pharmaceutical quality, the non-clinical and clinical programme. Broadly, the Scientific Advice 
recommendations were followed by the applicant and the development has followed a stepwise approach in 
demonstrating the comparability with the reference medicinal product. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Abasria (LY2963016) has the same pharmaceutical form and strength as the reference medicinal product Lantus. 
It is supplied as a sterile solution for subcutaneous injection. The intended commercial formulation is presented 
in 3 mL glass cartridges. Each mL of Abasria (insulin glargine injection) contains 100 units of insulin glargine, 
zinc (zinc oxide), metacresol, glycerol  and water for injection, as well as hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide 
(used for pH adjustment). It will be made available in 2 presentations: a 3 mL cartridge, for delivery by a 
compatible CE-marked reusable pen injector, and the same 3 mL cartridge sealed in a prefilled pen injector 
Assessment report

(KwikPen). The pen injectors differ from those available to administer Lantus cartridges, but are appropriate for 
use with Lilly insulin cartridges.  
Overall clinical lots representing two different presentations of LY2963016 finished product produced using the 
same active substance process material, were used in the clinical program. Both finished product presentations 
used the same formulation, which was filled into 3 mL cartridges (manufactured at Lilly, France) or 10 mL vials 
(manufactured at Lilly, Indianapolis).  
A comparability exercise has been performed for the proposed LY2963016 biosimilar product with the reference 
medicinal product, EU-approved Lantus. Data generated with US-approved Lantus has also been presented and 
is considered supportive.  
Although this dossier is not considered a Quality by Design application, certain elements of an enhanced 
approached were applied. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Abasria is formulated from LY2963016 active substance, which is also referred to in the dossier as basal insulin 
analogue V (BIV). LY2963016 is a two-chain peptide containing 53 amino acids; a 21 amino acid A-chain and a 
32 amino acid B-chain that are non-glycosylated.  
LY2963016 (INN: insulin glargine) differ from human insulin by the addition of 2 arginine residues to the 
C-terminus of the B-chain and the replacement of the asparagine at position A21 with a glycine.  
Figure 1: Primary Structure of LY2963016 
These changes shift the isoelectric point such that the analogue is soluble at an acidic pH, but less soluble at 
neutral physiological pH. Once injected, the insulin analogue precipitates in the neutral pH environment of the 
subcutaneous injection site, delaying absorption and prolonging the duration-of-action without a pronounced 
peak in the time action profile. In vivo, the 2 arginines are cleaved and the molecule interacts with the native 
insulin receptor.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
LY2963016 is produced in transformed Escherichia coli bacteria, and purified using established biotechnology 
purification procedures. Fermentation of E.coli transformed with the appropriate expression plasmid results in 
the expression of a pre-pro-protein. Granules of pre-pro-protein are then recovered from the fermentation broth 
by homogenising the cells prior to removal of cell debris/granule concentration by differential centrifugation. 
After isolation, the product undergoes solubilisation and sulfitolysis (opening of disulphide bonds). The product 
is then re-folded to form a proinsulin-like intermediate with correct disulphide bonds. After re-folding the leader 
sequence is enzymatically removed. Finally, the active substance, LY2963016 (BIV) is formed by enzymatically 
removing the connecting peptide (C-peptide).  
Subsequent chromatography steps are then employed to remove process and product-related impurities, before 
the active substance is crystallised, dried and filled into final containers.  
LY2963016 active substance is filled in a glass bottle and plastic screw caps. The compatibility and the protection 
provided by the container closure system have been confirmed by the active substance stability data.  
The manufacturing process is well described, and in general the process controls are appropriate.  
Information has been provided for the laboratory, pilot and commercial scale operations used in manufacture of 
Abasria (LY2963016 insulin glargine), to demonstrate the validity of the models used at each of the process 
steps to determine the acceptance criteria for the manufacturing process. The applicant has provided 
justification for the claimed proven acceptable ranges (PAR), Critical Process Parameters, Acceptable Ranges for 
Operational Process Parameters and In-Process Controls, as well as the Normal Operating Ranges, based on 
laboratory/pilot scale, commercial scale. The application of measurement uncertainty (MU) has been clarified 
and the use of this to determine the operational PAR is endorsed. Some of the acceptance ranges have been 
tightened, based on the laboratory, pilot and commercial scale process validation data. This provides 
reassurance regarding the manufacturing process control. 
The applicant has provided information from the process validation study to demonstrate that the loading 
targets in commercial scale for the Drum Thaw, Transformation  and Crystallization are met.  The applicant has 
confirmed that, at all steps, material is controlled within the established intermediate hold times. 
The strategy for chromatography resin lifetime monitoring has been explained.  Details of the output parameter 
ranges and actions if those ranges are exceeded have been given.  Cleaning and storage details for the resins 
have also been provided.   
Details of the shipping validation have been provided.  This demonstrates that the active substance is 
maintained at less than -39°C, which is acceptable.   
Control of materials 
The gene was designed with appropriate sequences for ligation into a platform expression plasmid backbone. 
The plasmid was used to transform the E. coli host strain and a clonal recombinant derivative was used to 
produce the Master and Working Cell Banks.  
The development of the transformed host strain and construction and control of the working and master cell 
banks is considered adequate. Details for stability testing of the MCB and WCB have been provided, including 
growth of thawed cells and characterisation to confirm retention of the plasmid.  Restriction enzyme digest 
analysis is performed to confirm the correct plasmid banding pattern and the product identity is confirmed by 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/340840/2014

testing the fermentation culture for potency of product intermediate.  Growth data are compared with expected 
data and fermentation potency data used to demonstrate that the revived cells can be used to manufacture the 
desired product intermediate.  
Manufacturing process development 
Several active substance manufacturing processes have been utilised throughout LY2963016 development.  
On the whole, comparability between clinically qualified material and proposed commercial material was 
demonstrated using extensive characterisation of active substance and finished product batches. Additional 
structural characterization data have been provided, with tests performed directly on active substance batches 
and some tests performed on finished product batches manufactured using active substance from the two 
processes and representing both finished product sites (contract manufacturer, USA and Lilly, France). 
Comparability was demonstrated for primary structure, secondary structure, tertiary structure and quaternary 
structure. Stability data under both long term and accelerated conditions was also provided to support the 
comparability.  
Characterisation 
The structure of LY2963016 has been elucidated through detailed structural characterization of the primary 
reference standard and a commercial-scale finished product demonstration batch. Consistency with the 
expected LY2963016 amino acid sequence has been demonstrated. Higher order structural characterization has 
been demonstrated. Additional structural characterization data and biological potency data have been provided, 
with tests performed directly on active substance batches and some tests performed on finished product batches 
manufactured using active substance from the two processes and representing both finished product sites 
(contract manufacturer, USA and Lilly, France). 
The biological activity has been characterised utilising several physiologically relevant assays.  
LY2963016 related impurities that are seen in the final active substance were isolated and characterized.  
Host cell proteins, proinsulin precursor, bacterial endotoxins, iron, and ethanol process related impurities are 
routinely tested against batch release specifications.  
Specification 
The control tests proposed for the active substance are considered appropriate to ensure sufficient quality with 
respect to identity, purity/impurities, potency and safety (microbial). 
The potency assay is an HPLC method. The method has demonstrated specificity for LY2963016. The 
specification limit is consistent with the specification for total impurities and allows for assay variability. The 
assay quantifies mg of LY2963016 per mg of total solid and is corrected for any volatiles that may be present via 
the LOD method. The proposed limit is aligned with the human insulin active substance compendial and 
registered limits. 
The bioidentity method for LY2963016 is a cell-based reporter gene assay. 
The analytical procedures used to characterise and control LY2963016 quality are generally appropriate and 
validated. 
Batch data has been presented for multiple validation batches. Data from the validation batches, clinical batches 
and primary stability batches are all comparable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/340840/2014 
Page 12/65 
  
  
 
Stability 
The stability data presented support the proposed shelf-life of 30 months at -10°C. Nine months long term 
(-10°C) stability data are available for the Process validation and production lots of active substance. Six 
months accelerated (5°C) stability data are available. Based on stability data comparison, the commercial 
process and the process used to generate clinically qualified material are comparable in terms of long term 
(-10°C) and accelerated (5°C) stability.  
Stress testing was also done to identify possible degradation pathways. Photostability studies were performed, 
showing that LY2963016 is light sensitive and is therefore packaged to protect it from light. 
In accordance with EU GMP guidelines1, any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, 
should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Abasria finished product will be made available in 2 presentations: a 3 mL cartridge, for delivery by a compatible 
CE-marked reusable pen injector and the same 3 mL cartridge sealed in a disposable prefilled pen injector 
(KwikPen). The glass cartridge has an elastomeric disc seal and plunger for administration via subcutaneous 
injection. The plungers and glass cartridges are siliconized.  
Abasria is a clear and colorless solution. It is formulated so that LY2963016 active ingredient is at a 
concentration of 100 Units/mL. It contains no novel excipients. Excipients include glycerol, metacresol  and zinc. 
Glycerol is added as a tonicity modifier, metcresol as preservative and zinc as a stabiliser. The solution is 
unbuffered (pH 4).  
The LY2963016 Injection finished product formulation is manufactured with no overage of the active substance. 
For the finished product filling operation, the cartridges are overfilled to ensure the delivery of the minimum 
volume (3 mL) claimed on the cartridge label.  
The LY2963016 Injection formulation development focused on understanding the impact of variation in 
excipients and formulation composition on key analytical properties of the finished product. The intended 
commercial formulation of LY2963016 Injection is based on the reference medicinal product. The formulation 
has been used throughout product development and in all clinical studies. 
All excipients are the same chemical compounds and concentrations as those used in Lantus except 2 minor 
differences. The LY2963016 Injection formulation uses zinc oxide, instead of zinc chloride as in LANTUS. Zinc 
oxide is chemically converted to zinc chloride by dissolving it in an excess amount of 10% hydrochloric acid 
before its addition to the formulation solution. Additionally, LY2963016 Injection formulation uses 100% 
glycerol which is consistent with Lilly insulin manufacturing practice whereas LANTUS uses 85% glycerol. The 
final levels of zinc and glycerol in LY2963016 Injection and in LANTUS are the same.

The applicant has adopted an enhanced approach to formulation development and proposes a formulation 
design space. The stability of the formulation at the target concentration of each component, but also within the 
region surrounding the target concentration was studied using statistical design of experiments (DoE). The 
experimental design was a full factorial design with 3 factors and 2 levels for each factor. Critical quality 
attributes (CQA) have been identified. Data from the DoE evaluation of the Proven Acceptable Ranges (PAR) 
have been provided to show the impact of process parameters on the CQAs.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The aseptic manufacturing process for Abasria is a standard formulation, filtration and filling operation. 
Cartridges are then assembled into pen injectors or packaged in blisters. The cartridge and disc seal components 
are well-established components having been used with marketed insulin products for several years. The 
plunger is made of an elastomer formulation selected for improved compatibility properties with this product. 
The safety of the container closure system components with LY2963016 has been confirmed with compendia 
compliance and with real time leachables studies. No analytes were measured above the allowable daily intake 
threshold, indicating a safe toxicological profile. 
The process is well described and a detailed risk assessment was carried out to assign critical, non-critical and 
operational parameters. The process is well controlled.   
Finished Product will be manufactured at a contract manufacturer, USA and Lilly, France.  Process data is 
provided for the primary batches and commercial batches produced at Lilly, France and the contract 
manufacturer, USA. The batch data presented are consistent on the whole for each manufacturing site, with 
data provided from process validation batches from both sites. Validation for components, equipment and 
aseptic processing is in place. Media fill program has been validated for sterility at both the contract 
manufacturer and Lilly France. Compatibility with the non-metal and metal equipment was evaluated and the 
results are satisfactory. 
Injection cartridges manufactured at the 2 sites (contract manufacturer, USA and Lilly, France) were tested for 
comparability. There was a detailed study which included structural and batch release data comparisons. An 
assessment of secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure has been made. In conclusion, comparability of the 
contract manufacturer, USA and Lilly, France batches has been established and stability data has been provided 
for the process validation batches produced from active substance manufactured using the proposed 
commercial active substance process.  
Details for the cartridge and pen-injector (KwikPen) have been provided. The pen assembly process validation 
strategy has been described and successful process validation gives assurance that these meet the required 
quality standards.  
Product specification 
The control tests proposed for the finished product are considered appropriate to ensure sufficient quality with 
respect to identity, purity/impurities, potency and safety (microbial).  
The analytical methods are validated and the majority of methods are used to control both the active substance 
and finished product, except for the metacresol method. 
Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf life of 24 months at 5°C is supported by data. Stability studies are being conducted for 3 
primary batches from each site according to ICH Q5C “Stability testing of biotechnological/biological products” 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/340840/2014 
Page 14/65 
  
  
guideline. Stability data show that all analytical properties remained within the proposed specifications at the 
storage condition of 5°C through the available time points.  The patient in-use stability study was conducted 
using finished product stored under long term conditions for 14 or 24 months. Results were in line with the 
acceptance criteria and showed no degradation or significant impurity increase.  
The finished product is light sensitive, so packaging ensures exposure to light is minimised. 
In general, the results support the shelf life and storage conditions as defined in the SPC. 
In accordance with EU GMP guidelines2, any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, 
should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA. 
Biosimilar comparability exercise for finished medicinal product 
Abasria (LY2963016) has been developed with the same pharmaceutical form and strength as LANTUS, allowing 
direct comparison of the finished products. The biosimilar comparability testing included structural 
characterization, physicochemical characterization, biological potency (biological activity), impurity 
characterization and stability assessment.  
The applicant initially proposed to first confirm comparability between US-approved and EU approved Lantus, 
and between LY2963016 injection that is manufactured at Lilly France and contract manufacturer. Once the two 
populations of each product were shown to be comparable, it was proposed that comparability would be 
demonstrated between Lantus and LY2963016 Injection. This approach to the biosimilar comparability exercise 
was not fully in line with the CHMP guidelines for biosimilars.  For the quality biosimilarity exercise, the proposed 
biosimilar product should be demonstrated to be comparable to the EU reference medicinal product, using 
multiple batches. In addition, the recommended approach of generating the required quality, safety and efficacy 
data for the biosimilar comparability study with product manufactured using the final manufacturing process and 
therefore representing the quality profile of the batches to be commercialised was not followed. 
The applicant subsequently provided data for additional batches of EU-approved Lantus and segregated the 
information derived from EU-approved and US-approved Lantus.  Data from LY2963016 batches manufactured 
by Lilly France and the contract manufacturer has also been presented separately to allow appropriate 
assessment.  Data comparing LY2963016 and EU-approved Lantus side-by-side has been presented and 
orthogonal methods have been used for the structural analysis of the primary, secondary, tertiary and 
quaternary structure. The biosimilar comparability exercise has compared the LY2963016 with the EU-approved 
Lantus, followed by comparison of the EU-approved Lantus with the US-approved Lantus, to demonstrate the 
validity of the supportive clinical studies carried out with US-approved Lantus. Additional data from the process 
validation batches has allowed comparison of the final proposed commercial process with the EU-approved 
Lantus.  
Physico-chemical characterisation has demonstrated biosimilar comparability between LY2963016 and the 
reference medicinal product, EU-approved Lantus, with the only observed difference being the presence of low 
levels of citrate in the Lantus samples detected by NMR. Reference has been made to data using in vitro 
biological assays with process validation batches and this has been reviewed in the non-clinical assessment. 
Biological potency has also been evaluated by testing LY2963016 Injection and Lantus in a comparability study. 
This demonstrated that the average relative potency was comparable for all these batches of LY2963016 
Injection and Lantus. The applicant has also provided biological identity test data from LY2963016 Injection and

Lantus with batches tested concurrently, which were demonstrated to be comparable, showing that the original 
differences observed were due to analytical variability and diverse testing times for the samples. 
Total impurities and HMWP measured by release methods were lower in LY2963016 Injection batches compared 
with Lantus, which is attributed to the increased age of the reference medicinal product. One impurity, not found 
in measurable amounts in Lantus but present in LY2963016 Injection clinical trial batches is below the ICH 
threshold for toxicity. This impurity is controlled and the applicant has discussed potential clinical implications. 
The assay results between LY2963016 Injection and Lantus indicate that Lantus is formulated to a slightly higher 
concentration, which did not translate into consistent PK differences. 
The Applicant has provided data to support the claim that LY2963016 Injection and Lantus have similar 
precipitation characteristics under physiological conditions (in phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.4).  This 
demonstrates that these two products have comparable in vitro precipitation and the finished products would be 
expected to behave in a similar manner in vivo. 
The proposed shelf-life for Abasria is 24 months at 2-8°C, including an in-use period of up to 28 days at 30°C. 
For Lantus it is also 24 months at 2-8°C, but including an in-use period of up to 28 days at 25°C. Stability is 
comparable on the whole for LY2963016 Injection and Lantus batches, in terms of rates of degradation. 
  Both products showed significant degradation on exposure to iron, but the pathway of degradation appeared 
different. Further studies demonstrated that these differences are likely to be due to citrate, which has been 
detected in Lantus. Differences were not observed with lower levels of iron, particularly at the levels expected to 
be present in LY2963016 Injection. Therefore, this discrepancy in iron-induced degradation is not expected to 
have any impact on the Abasria product under normal conditions. 
Overall, comparability between LY2963016 and the reference medicinal product Lantus has been satisfactorily 
demonstrated from the quality perspective.  
Adventitious agents 
Biological materials used in the production of LY2963016 have been evaluated for possible sources of bacterial 
and viral contamination. Biological materials used in the LY2963016 process are of bacterial, microbial or plant 
sources. No reagents are derived from human or animal sources. Since the E.coli host strain is not susceptible 
to mycoplasma or viruses, no control/reduction measures are required.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects   
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product have been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product 
should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 
During the procedure, a major objection was raised regarding the control strategy for the manufacturing 
process, which was not clearly explained. In response, the Applicant provided a clearer explanation of the 
manufacturing process control, based on laboratory, pilot and commercial scale operations used in the 
manufacture of Abasria.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/340840/2014 
Page 16/65 
  
  
Justifications for the claimed proven acceptable ranges (PAR), Critical Process Parameters, Acceptable Ranges 
for Operational Process Parameters and In-Process Controls, as well as the Normal Operating Ranges, based on 
laboratory/pilot scale, and commercial scale were submitted.  This provided reassurance regarding the 
manufacturing process control and the major objection was considered resolved.  
Initially, comparability between different processes was not considered sufficiently demonstrated due to the lack 
of information provided regarding the nature of some of the process changes implemented and the limited 
degree of testing applied. The Applicant provided further clarifications and data to demonstrate comparability. 
This included extensive characterisation of active substance and finished product batches, with tests performed 
directly on active substance batches and some tests performed on finished product batches manufactured using 
active substance from different processes and representing both finished product sites (contract 
manufacturer USA and Lilly France).   
Primary stability data was provided for clinical trial batches, rather than the proposed commercial process. Lack 
of data from finished product manufactured through a validated process and with the final commercial active 
substance process gave rise to a major objection on the claimed shelf life of 24 months at +5°C for the finished 
product. The applicant provided stability data up to 6 months for batches produced via the validated finished 
product process and from active substance produced via the commercial process. This provided additional 
assurance regarding the comparability between different processes and consequently the proposed shelf life 
was found acceptable. 
A major objection raised regarding the suitability of the proposed commercial plunger system was thoroughly 
addressed by the applicant. It was demonstrated that finished product using the commercial plunger system and 
stored under the long term storage conditions (2-8°C) is sufficiently stable for the patient in-use period (of 28 
days at 30°C) if used within its suggested shelf-life of 24 months. 
For the demonstration on biosimilar comparability with the reference medicinal product, a major objection was 
raised regarding the limited techniques applied and insufficient number of batches of reference product 
(EU-approved Lantus) analysed for several tests. Further data was provided, including side-by-side comparisons 
between Abasria and EU-approved Lantus using orthogonal methods. Data provided assurance of comparability 
for primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure. Additional data and clarifications were submitted to 
satisfactorily demonstrate comparability in terms of potency and biological identity. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
Overall, comparability between LY2963016 and the reference medicinal product Lantus, approved in the EU, 
has been satisfactorily demonstrated from the quality perspective.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP 
recommends the following points for investigation: 
The applicant should reassess the RP-HPLC finished product specifications once further data are generated, 
including in-use stability data after long term storage of the finished product for 24 months.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology 
The primary aim of the pharmacology package was to demonstrate similarity between the proposed product, 
Abasria (LY2963016) and the reference medicinal product, Lantus.  Studies were first conducted in order to 
compare the pharmacological activity of a batch of LY2963016 to that of a US-approved batch of Lantus and 
subsequently, studies were also conducted with EU-approved Lantus (in accordance with CHMP Scientific 
advice) and with EU and US-formulated LY2963016.  The applicant has therefore provided a series of 
pharmacology studies with EU and US-formulated LY2963016 and EU and US-approved Lantus and has 
attempted to characterise the binding affinity and functional activity at the relevant insulin receptors.  In 
addition, the potential to stimulate lipogenic activity in adipocytes and mitogenicity in IR and IGF-1 receptor 
dominant cells has been evaluated. 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Overall, the general rank orders of affinity to and potency (autophosphorylation) of Lantus and insulin reference 
compounds at the IGF-1, IR-A and IR-B receptors were in line with that reported previously [Sommerfeld, 
2010].  Data from the preliminary study suggest that the affinity and potency (autophosphorylation) of a batch 
of LY2963016 was similar to that of US-approved Lantus at the IGF-1, IR-A and/or IR-B receptors.  In the 
definitive study, the affinity of batches of LY2963016 evaluated (EU and US-pooled) was considered to be similar 
to the batches of Lantus (EU and US-pooled).  The potency of LY2963016 (EU and US-pooled) at the IR-A was 
slightly (1.2-fold) lower than Lantus (EU and US pooled) and the potency of US-formulated LY2963016 at the 
IR-A and IR-B receptor was 1.2 to 1.6-fold higher than that of EU-formulated material.  The CHMP notes that the 
observed difference in potency at the IR-A receptor (between EU and US-LY2963016) correlates with a 
difference in affinity.  Although the observed differences were statistically significant, the applicant did not 
consider these differences to be of biological significance [as the observed difference was less than the mean 
significant ratio (MSR); see Discussion]. 
The applicant suggested that in mouse adipocytes, the lipogenic potency of LY2963016 was similar to that of the 
reference product, Lantus.  In the definitive study, statistical differences were observed when comparing the 
lipogenic/metabolic potencies (EC 50) of pooled LY2963016  and pooled Lantus as well as US-formulated 
LY2963016 to EU-LY2963016.  As the observed differences (1.3-1.4-fold) were below the minimum significant 
ratio (2.61), the applicant considered that these differences were not biologically significant. 
In human osteosarcoma SAOS-2 cells where the mitogenic response is more dependent upon IGF-1R signalling 
when compared to that of the IR, the rank order of mitogenic potency was in line with the rank order of affinity 
at the IGF-1 receptor and the rank order of autophosphorylation at the IGF-1 receptor [Sommerfeld, 2010], 
which would suggest that the assay has been sufficiently characterised.  Although the EU-formulated LY2963016 
had a slightly higher potency when compared to US formulated LY2963016 (1.3-fold, not significant), overall the 
data presented from the preliminary and definitive studies would suggest that in the SAOS-2 cell line, the 
mitogenic potency of the batches of LY2963016 tested is generally similar to that of the reference product, 
Lantus. 
In rat H4IIe hepatoma cells where the mitogenic response is IR-dependent (under serum-free conditions); 
overall, the mitogenic potency of LY2963016 (pooled) was considered by the applicant to be similar to that of the 
reference product, Lantus (pooled).  It is noted however, that the mitogenic potential of EU-formulated 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/340840/2014 
Page 18/65 
  
  
LY2963016 was higher than that of US-formulated LY2963016 (1.7-fold) and the applicant did not consider the 
observed difference to be biologically relevant. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies have been conducted with LY2963016.  These are not required for this 
type of application. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
No safety pharmacodynamic studies have been conducted with LY2963016.  Safety phamacology studies are 
not required for this type of application. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been submitted, which is acceptable for this type of 
application. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
In light of the fact that this is a biosimilar application, the absence of distribution, metabolism, excretion and 
pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies is considered acceptable as the proposed product has the same 
primary amino acid sequence as the reference product, Lantus, which is currently marketed. 
Toxicokinetic analysis was performed during the repeated-dose toxicity studies to clarify whether serum 
exposures of insulin glargine were similar for LY2963016 and EU- and US-approved Lantus.  The analytical 
methods used for the toxicokinetic analyses of samples from the definitive toxicity studies were validated.  
Repeated administration of LY2963016 or Lantus caused a dose-related increase in exposures to 
immunoreactive insulin glargine; however, the observed increase was not considered to be dose-proportional.  
There was some evidence of accumulation upon repeated dosing.  The applicant has suggested that the 
exposures to insulin glargine are similar following subcutaneous administration of LY2963016 vs Lantus; 
however, the data as presented during the initial submission were difficult to interpret and further clarification 
was sought.  The applicant subsequently presented the data in a manner which allowed comparison; the 
exposures to insulin glargine as presented were extremely variable in the LY2963016 and Lantus treated groups 
and there was no clear difference in exposures between the groups.  However, with respect to the determination 
of exposures to insulin glargine the potential for cross reactivity with rat insulin was noted and clarification was 
sought as to why C-peptide correction was not applied.  The applicant highlighted the technical challenges of 
measuring C-peptide rat serum levels and referred to clinical PK data which demonstrate that endogenous 
insulin levels are not a significant confounding factor in the comparison of the pharmacokinetics of Lantus and 
LY2963016. 
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Single-dose toxicity studies have not been conducted with LY2963016. This was considered acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/340840/2014 
Page 19/65 
  
  
Repeat dose toxicity 
In the rat, repeated administration of LY2963016 or Lantus was associated with mortality and clinical signs 
indicative of severe hypoglycaemia.  The mortality rates observed following subcutaneous administration of 
LY2963016 were generally comparable to that observed with EU or US-approved Lantus.  The maximum 
observed reductions in glucose were observed between 1 to 4 hours post-dose and the duration of 
hypoglycaemia was dose-related, persisting for up to 2, 8 and 12 to 18 hours post-dose at 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0/2.0 
mg/kg, respectively.  The applicant considered the glucodynamic profiles for LY2963016 and Lantus (US or 
EU-approved) to be similar.  An increase in body weight/body weight gain and food consumption was also noted 
and is considered to be secondary to the observed hyperinsulinaemia and hypoglycaemia. 
Effects on the central and peripheral nervous system have been reported for agents that induce hypoglycaemia, 
including insulin glargine [Yasaki and Dyck 1990].  During the repeated-dose studies conducted by the 
applicant, such effects were limited to the sciatic nerve.  The CHMP notes that the incidence of degeneration of 
axons in the sciatic nerve at 2 mg/kg is higher in animals treated with LY2963016 (females) (when compared to 
EU-approved Lantus).  However, in light of the absence of a similar trend for the study comparing LY2963016 to 
US-approved Lantus or a clinical correlate, no further action is required. 
Increased deep dermal adipose tissue in skin/subcutis sections and at subcutaneous injection sites were 
observed at 1 mg/kg (LY2963016 and Lantus) which is indicative of lipohypertrophy (typical of insulins).  In 
addition, decreased pancreatic islet cell cytoplasm and vacuolation was noted at ≥1.0 mg/kg/day; this finding is 
indicative of islet cell atrophy and is consistent with negative feedback in hyperinsulinaemic animals and a 
subsequent reduction in insulin production.  The incidence of these findings appeared to be similar for 
LY2963016 vs. Lantus. 
The CHMP also notes that the NOAEL for the 4-week study in the rat was 0.3 mg/kg for LY2963016 or 
EU/US-approved Lantus.  Although the studies conducted by the innovator (as presented by the applicant) did 
not include a 1-month study, it is acknowledged that the NOAELs for 3 and 6-month studies were of a similar 
magnitude (0.146 mg/kg and 0.229 mg/kg, respectively). 
Genotoxicity 
In line with current guidelines on the development of similar biological medicinal products, no genotoxicity 
studies have been performed. 
Carcinogenicity 
In line with current guidelines on the development of similar biological medicinal products, no carcinogenicity 
studies have been performed. 
In accordance with the Points to consider document on the non-clinical assessment of the carcinogenic potential 
of insulin analogues [CPMP/SWP/372/01], the applicant has provided some discussion of the carcinogenic 
potential of the proposed product and it is agreed that if LY2963016 is considered biosimilar to Lantus, then the 
carcinogenic risk should be similar to that of Lantus (and therefore acceptable).  After review of the initial 
submission, the potential for LY2963016 (and how this compares to EU-approved Lantus) to cause 
IR-dependent mitogenesis was not entirely clear as all of the relevant pharmacology studies had not been 
conducted with material that was representative of the proposed commercial product.  Subsequently, the 
applicant conducted a series of studies with commercial process material (reported within DBT 149), which 
demonstrated that the mitogenic potential of LY2963016 was similar to that of Lantus.  However, further 
clarification was sought as to why IGF-1 was not included as a reference in the assay conducted in human 
osteosarcoma SAOS-2 cells where the mitogenic response was said to be IGF-1 dependent.  Additional studies 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/340840/2014 
Page 20/65 
  
  
were performed in order to address this and IGF-1 and other reference standards were included in order to 
characterise the assay, as per regulatory guidance. 
In conclusion, taking all of the data submitted into consideration, it is agreed that the carcinogenic risk of the 
proposed product is similar to that of the currently marketed product, Lantus. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
In line with current guidelines on the development of similar biological medicinal products, no reproduction 
toxicity studies have been performed. 
Local Tolerance  
Local tolerability of LY2963016 was assessed in conjunction with clinical observations and histopathological 
evaluations of injection sites in the two 4-week repeat-dose toxicity studies. No clinical or histological signs of 
injection site reactions were noted at the injection sites with either LY2963016 or EU- or US-approved Lantus. 
Increased fat was observed in the skin, subcutis and at the injection sites of rats injected with LY2963016 or 
Lantus.  The incidence of this finding was comparable in LY2963016 and Lantus-treated groups. 
Other toxicity studies 
No other toxicity studies have been submitted. 
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
According to Section 2 of the Guideline on the environmental risk assessment (ERA) of medicinal products for 
human use [EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00], peptides and proteins are excluded from the need for an 
environmental risk assessment.  An ERA is therefore not required. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical (pharmacology) studies were conducted with material from a process similar to the process 
used for the commercial product.  A major objection was raised, as the batches of LY2963016 tested were not 
truly representative of the final commercial product and biocomparability between material from the processes 
had not been adequately demonstrated.  The applicant subsequently performed a series of in vitro studies in 
order to address this issue and the data were submitted in a separate report. 
The pharmacology written summary and the text within the study reports suggest that the potency (in terms of 
the ability to stimulate autophosphorylation at the IR receptors, lipogenesis and mitogenesis) of the test articles 
was expressed as the EC50 relative to a maximum response as observed with an insulin reference standard.  
Although the data as presented did allow comparison of the respective groups, definitive conclusions as to how 
LY2963016 compares to Lantus could not be made upon review of the initial submission.  The applicant 
subsequently provided some raw and/or untransformed data which allowed an easier comparison of how the 
data points were distributed within each individual group and how the data were distributed for the negative 
controls vs. the maximum observed response. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/340840/2014 
Page 21/65 
  
  
 
The data from the preliminary and definitive binding affinity and potency (autophosphorylation) studies 
suggested that when compared to human insulin, the affinity and/or potency for Lantus was 1.4 to 1.7-fold 
higher at the IR-A receptor and only 1.1 to 1.8-fold higher at the IR-B receptor.  As the observed differences as 
presented in the dossier are slightly smaller than those observed by other investigators, this questioned 
(i) 
the focus on the pivotal study, DBT 134 where the difference between the affinity and potency of human 
insulin vs. Lantus at the IR-A and IR-B receptor was less pronounced (1.1-1.6-fold) and therefore raised 
concerns about the ability of this assay to pick up subtle differences in affinity (i.e. are the differences as 
observed during the pivotal studies actually larger than they appear?) 
(ii) 
the use of the minimum significant ratio, MSR, which ranged from 1.89 to 2.27 (2.61 for the metabolic 
potency assay) to define whether results were of biological significance.  By the applicant’s definition the 
observed difference in affinity and potency between human insulin and Lantus is not biologically 
relevant as it was less than the MSR; this is in contrast to the overall conclusions in the EPAR summary 
for Lantus. 
In the responses provided, while the applicant maintained that the data generated during the conduct of studies, 
DBT 93, DBT 134 and those performed by Sommerfeld and colleagues are similar, it was still evident from the 
data presented, that the observed differences between Lantus and the positive control insulin were less 
pronounced during the pivotal study, DBT 134.  However, the applicant conducted a more recent study with 
commercial process material and implemented a number of measures in order to reduce the extent of 
variability.  Moreover, statistical comparisons were made between LY2963016 and EU-approved Lantus.  The 
observed differences in affinity and potency observed during Study DBT 149 (for insulin vs. Lantus) were closer 
to those published by Sommerfeld and colleagues, despite the differences in the assay systems employed, which 
was somewhat encouraging.  However, it was noted that the magnitude of the differences between the positive 
controls, insulin and AspB10, (the latter is known to have higher affinity at the IGF-1 and IR receptors) was 
consistently smaller in the more recent study, DBT 149, when compared to the original study DBT 134.  The 
Guideline on non-clinical and clinical development of similar biological medicinal products containing 
recombinant human insulin and insulin analogues [EMA/134217/2012] specifically states that it is important 
that assays used for comparability testing are demonstrated to have appropriate sensitivity to detect minute 
differences.  Given that measures were put in place to improve the assay, the applicant was asked to discuss 
why the DBT 149 study did not demonstrate a larger difference in potency between the reference standards, 
insulin and AspB10 at the IR receptors (particularly the IR-A receptor, where the smallest difference was 
apparent).  It is also noted that if the applicant’s rationale is to be applied, the difference in potency at the IR-A 
receptor between insulin and AspB10 was not of biological significance, so yet again, the application of the MSR 
to decipher whether differences are of biological significance is questionable and even after receipt of the Day 
120 responses, use of the MSR in this context was still not adequately justified. 
The applicant subsequently clarified that the mean potency ratio for IR-A phosphorylation when comparing the 
potency of insulin to that of the positive control, AspB10 was lower than that previously reported in the literature 
and that this was most likely due to spurious results generated during a single run.  The overall observed 
difference in IR-A phosphorylation for LY2963016 vs Lantus was simply due to a higher potency ratio again 
generated during a single run.  Given the inherent variability, the Rapporteurs noted that an increased n number 
should have been considered at the time the studies were conducted.  However, when all of the data generated 
during the 3 separate studies are reviewed as a whole, to produce a larger n number, it is acknowledged that the 
IR-A phosphorylation assay has the ability to detect differences and the Rapporteurs agreed that the observed 
difference between the proposed product and the reference product is not of biological significance. 
Assessment report

Clarification was also sought with respect to the insulin reference standards used during the binding affinity 
assays as some discrepancies were noted within study report DBT 134; these were addressed upon submission 
of the Day 120 responses.   
Close examination of the data generated during the preliminary lipogenic potency assay (DBT 93) revealed a 
considerable amount of variability and in contrast to conclusions drawn by the applicant, the rank order of 
metabolic potency for the test articles and the reference compounds (Insulin AspB10>human 
insulin=IGF-1>Lantus) was not in line with that observed for IR autophosphorylation (Insulin Asp B10>human 
insulin>Lantus>IGF-1), which questioned the ability of the assay to compare the potency of LY2963016 vs. 
Lantus with respect to their ability of stimulate IR-dependent lipogenesis and the applicant’s interpretation of 
the data generated.  The data generated during the more recent study (DBT 149) were less variable and no 
differences in lipogenic potency were apparent for LY2963016 vs. Lantus.  However, it is noted that IGF-1 was 
not included as a reference. 
In rat H4IIe hepatoma cells where the mitogenic response is IR-dependent (under serum-free conditions), 
results from the preliminary study showed that the rank order of potency for rat H4IIe hepatocyte proliferation 
was similar to that observed for IR autophosphorylation activity (insulin Asp-B10 > human insulin > LY2963016 
or Lantus >>> IGF-1).  However, the rank order of mitogenic potency as demonstrated during the definitive 
study was not in line with that observed for IR autophosphorylation, (the potency of insulin was ≥ Insulin 
AspB10 and the effects of IGF-1 were not evaluated).  Once again, this suggests limitations of the assay used 
with respect to the mapping of potency at the IR receptor and a functional response (the mitogenic response was 
previously described by the applicant to be IR-dependent).  In the more recent study (DBT 149), the applicant 
demonstrated that insulin AspB10 was more potent than insulin in both the IR-A phosphorylation and the 
mitogenic assay in rat hepatoma cells which is reassuring.  However, concerns remained as to why the reference 
IGF-1 was omitted during Study 149 considering that current regulatory guidance recommends its inclusion; 
hence, the applicant was invited to address whether the assays (particularly the SAO2-cell assay where 
mitogenesis is said to be IGF-1 dependent) were sufficiently characterised.  In response to the concerns raised 
by the CHMP, the applicant conducted a number of additional studies which included the comparison of the 
binding and activity of insulin, AspB10, IGF-1 and a range of other related compounds.  Overall, the order of 
potency of the standards was similar to that published previously and it was acknowledged that the SAO2 cell 
assay along with the other in vitro assays used had been adequately characterised in line with regulatory 
guidance.  However, the applicant should submit all of the new data generated as a formal report after 
marketing authorisation. 
It is evident that throughout the initial dossier, small but significant differences in affinity and potency 
(autophosphorylation, lipogenesis, mitogenesis) were noted when comparing LY2963016 to Lantus or 
US-formulated LY2963016 to EU-formulated LY2963016 for example.  However, the applicant suggested that 
these differences were not of biological significance.  In adition, the applicant has stated that the affinity and 
potency of LY2963016 and Lantus are independent of the source of test article.  Consequently, the results with 
US and EU-material (for both LY2963016 and Lantus) have been pooled for subsequent analyses.  The use of the 
MSR to demonstrate whether differences are biologically significant was not accepted and it was the view of the 
CHMP that datasets (generated with US and EU product) displaying significant differences should not be pooled 
in order to facilitate further statistical evaluations.  Moreover, it was requested that all comparisons should be 
made to the EU-approved Lantus (as opposed to EU and US-pooled data for Lantus).  In the Day 120 responses, 
the applicant provided the statistical comparisons to the EU-approved reference product, as requested:  In the 
study conducted previously, i.e. DBT 134; it is evident that significant differences were noted between US 
(contract manufacturer)-LY2963016 and EU-approved Lantus in the IR-A phosphorylation, IR-B 
phosphorylation and lipogenesis assays.  It is agreed that the observed differences were largely due to the fact 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/340840/2014 
Page 23/65 
  
  
that the US-LY2963016 samples were not evaluated in the same run as the Lantus, EU LY2963016 and the 
relevant positive control samples. 
As described previously, an additional study (DBT 149) was conducted and the assays were improved to 
minimise the variability observed previously.  In this study, a statistical difference was noted in a single assay 
only, whereby the potency of EU-LY2963016 to phosphorylate the IR-A receptor was higher than that of 
EU-approved Lantus. On the basis of the numerical/fold difference in potency (1.16-fold) and on the basis of the 
fact that no statistical differences were noted in any of the other assays, it is agreed that overall, the 
pharmacological profile of LY2963016 (US or EU) is similar to that of EU-approved Lantus. 
Hence, the overarching Major Objection was resolved, as the data presented suggest that overall; the in vitro 
pharmacological profile of LY2963016 is similar to that of EU-approved Lantus.  In addition, the concerns with 
respect to the ability of the IR-A phosphorylation assay and its ability to detect subtle differences along with the 
omission of IGF-1 as a reference have all been addressed. 
The pharmacokinetic data submitted were quite limited and somewhat variable.  Two studies were performed 
which involved a comparison of LY2963016 to either US-approved Lantus or EU-approved Lantus.  The applicant 
was asked to present all parameters in the same manner to allow easier comparison of the datasets generated 
for both studies; to allow definitive conclusions with respect to similarity to be made.  The standard errors and 
deviations were fairly large and it was evident that there were no apparent differences in the exposure to insulin 
glargine when comparing LY2963016 to Lantus.  However, it is noted that the serum levels of insulin glargine 
were determined using a validated radioimmunoassay (RIA) method which did not appear to be highly specific 
for insulin glargine and cross reactivity with rat insulin was likely.  C-peptide was not measured, which suggests 
that no correction of data has been made to exclude physiological insulin; hence, further clarification was 
sought, especially in light of the observed variability.  The applicant maintained that measuring C-peptide levels 
was not required during the rat toxicology studies, as the contributions of endogenous insulin to the overall 
immunoreactive insulin glargine response are considered minimal.  In light of the technical challenges of 
measuring C-peptide rat serum levels, the applicant has referred to clinical data which provides further support 
that endogenous insulin levels are not a significant confounding factor in the comparison of the 
pharmacokinetics of Lantus and LY2963016. 
In the rat, following repeated dosing for up to 4 weeks, the applicant considered the glucodynamic profiles for 
LY2963016 and Lantus (US or EU-approved) to be similar.  However, the CHMP noted that there was a trend for 
the rebound increase in glucose levels at the end of the study (on Day 30) to occur at higher doses of LY2963016 
(2 mg/kg) when compared to EU-approved Lantus (≥1 mg/kg).  In addition, close examination of the tabulated 
Summary for Study 8259267 suggested that at the maximum dose tested (2 mg/kg), the increase in body 
weight gain with EU-approved Lantus was more pronounced than that observed with LY2963016.  Taken 
together with the in vitro data initially submitted, these data suggested that LY2963016 could be slightly less 
potent than EU-approved Lantus.  However, the applicant has clarified that the magnitude of the increase in 
serum glucose and the incidence of pancreatic islet cell atrophy following repeated administration of LY2963016 
are similar to that observed following treatment with EU-approved Lantus.  In addition, the applicant has 
suggested that when the absolute weights are plotted over time, it is evident that there is good agreement in the 
growth curves for LY2963016 and EU-approved Lantus. 
2.3.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In response to the Day 120 List of Questions, the applicant has repeated the in vitro pharmacology studies with 
batches of LY2963016 that are considered to be representative of the commercial product.  The methods used 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/340840/2014 
Page 24/65 
  
  
have been improved, the data appear to be less variable than that observed for the previous studies and the 
batches of LY2963016 tested appear to have a similar in vitro pharmacological profile to that of EU-approved 
Lantus.  However, there were still some concerns with respect to the ability of the IR-A phosphorylation assay 
to detect subtle differences, along with the omission of IGF-1 as a reference.  The applicant has admitted that 
the inherent variability contributed to the lack of a substantial difference between reference compounds and it 
is evident that a larger number of experiments should have been performed in order to overcome this.  The 
applicant has also performed a series of additional in vitro binding and functional studies to include IGF-1 and 
other related compounds as reference standards in order to characterise the methods further.  Taken together, 
these measures help to demonstrate that the assays used have the inherent ability to detect subtle differences. 
Following the evaluation of the latest submission of data, there were no non-clinical objections to the approval 
of Abasria; however, the CHMP recommended that the new data provided as responses during the procedure are 
submitted in a report within 6 months of marketing authorisation.

The biosimilar clinical comparability exercise is a stepwise procedure that should begin with pharmacokinetic 
(PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) comparative studies versus the chosen reference medicinal product. For 
Abasria, PK and PD data have been generated in four trials submitted in this application. Two studies 
encompassed pivotal evidence and three trials were conducted to generate supplemental evidence. It should be 
noted that Study ABEN was carried out entirely for PK/PD comparability of US and EU approved Lantus reference 
product. Study ABEM was conducted following CHMP SAWP recommendation to determine dose-dependent 
pattern of comparability. 
According to CHMP guidance PK/PD insulin clamp studies represent the mainstay of the proof of similar efficacy 
of the biosimilar and the reference insulin medicinal product. There is no anticipated need for specific efficacy 
studies since endpoints used in such studies, e.g. HBA1c, are not considered sufficiently sensitive for the 
purpose of showing biosimilarity. The applicant has carried out two efficacy trials provided within the current 
MAA. Apart from primary evaluation of the non-inferiority of LY2963016 once-daily (QD) to Lantus (QD), as 
measured by the change in HbA1c from baseline to 24 weeks, these studies included 7-point self-monitored 
blood glucose [SMBG] profiles and the data on intra-patient blood-glucose (BG) variability, basal and prandial 
(separately and as total daily) insulin dose, and weight. These comparability data constitute supportive evidence 
of clinical biosimilarity.  
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
PK and PD data on LY2963016 have been generated in four trials submitted in this application (ABEA, ABEI, 
ABEM, and ABEE). In addition, a 5th study (ABEO) was conducted for the purpose of a US submission in 
comparison to the US-reference product. Finally, the 6th study (ABEN) was a comparison of the US and 
EU-reference product with no data on LY2963016.

Analytical methods 
Analytical methods applied during the clinical development are summarised below. 
1.  Methods for measuring human immunoreactive insulin glargine 
A radioimmunoassay (RIA) was used to measure the “free” immunoreactive insulin (i.e., insulin and insulin 
analogues not bound to endogenous anti-insulin antibodies) in human serum. It is not selective for insulin 
glargine as the immunoreactive insulin response is a summative response to insulin glargine, its metabolites M1 
and M2, and endogenous insulin. The RIA assay has complete cross-reactivity to insulin glargine and 
endogenous insulin and is also expected to have complete reactivity to M1 and M2 given their molecular 
sequences. In a published study supported by Sanofi-Aventis a selective LC/MS/MS method provided the same 
results for M1 than the immunoreactive insulin measured with an unselective RIA assay since M1 appeared the 
predominant metabolite and insulin glargine and M2 concentrations were below the lower limit of quantitation 
(Lucidi, 2012). The LLOQ of the RIA assay is 50 pM and its percentage to the Cmax is approximately 30%, higher 
than 5% as recommended in the Guideline on the Bioanalytical Method Validation 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009). However, the assay is sufficiently sensitive to fully characterize the flat 
profile of the active drug over the 24-hour PK sampling window. 
The endogenous insulin concentration was separately estimated by measuring C-peptide using a commercial 
sandwich immunoassay approved by the FDA with additional validation by the central laboratory performing the 
analysis. The total measured insulin concentration was corrected with the endogenous insulin concentration 
using the method of Owens (1986). This is a well-established method that has been widely used ever since its 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/340840/2014 
Page 27/65 
  
  
 
 
introduction and was also used for the estimation of endogenous insulin for all studies conducted by 
Sanofi-Aventis with the reference product in healthy subjects. More recent methods have been proposed but are 
not devoid of limitations. As there is no gold standard, this method was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.  Method for measuring anti-insulin antibodies 
The immunogenicity assay was developed as a conventional radioligand binding assay. After adding a 
radiolabeled tracer (LY2963016) to a serum sample, percent binding represents the percent of the total amount 
of tracer that co-precipitates with the antibodies. Similar to titres, it is a method of quantifying the amount of 
antibody in a sample; unlike titres, it is a continuous variable. Antibodies to native human insulin and insulin 
analogues will also cross-react with LY2963016. Hence, antibodies to LY2963016, insulin glargine, native 
insulin, and insulin analogues are measured using the same assay. The assay was adequately validated for 
antibodies against LY2963016 and antibodies cross-reactive to insulin. The sensitivity of the method was 
considered acceptable. 
Methodology of PK/PD studies 
The clinical pharmacological development programme was designed to follow the recommendations of the draft 
revised Guideline on Biosimilar Insulins (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/2005_Rev. 1). It should be demonstrated 
that the pharmacokinetic profiles are similar after single administration and that the differences between the PD 
parameters are below a tight limit. Regarding PD measurements, this guideline asserts that the euglycaemic 
clamp technique is the best available method for the measurement of insulin action. In these clamp 
experiments, the plasma insulin concentration is raised (e.g. by subcutaneous injection of insulin) and the 
blood-glucose level maintained (“clamped”) at a pre-defined level by means of a variable infusion of glucose. 
Measurements of the plasma insulin concentration and glucose infusion rate (GIR) allow an estimation of the 
time-concentration and time-action profile. The primary variables are GIRAUC and GIRmax which are denoted as 
Gtot and Rmax in this submission. 
All studies (except for ABEI) had a double-blind cross-over design. PK and PD profiling was carried out 
synchronously and was confined to 24-hour monitoring in studies ABEI, ABEN, ABEM and ABEA and up to 
42-hour of euglycaemic clamp in Study ABEE. Hence the PK/PD evaluations covered a 24-42 hour period. 
Furthermore, to take into account the high variability of the parameters, replicate designs have been used in the 
main studies with four periods (2 on each product). 
All studies except for ABEE were conducted in healthy volunteers without prior endogenous insulin suppression. 
The adjustment to background C-peptide levels was done in a consistent way across all studies using Owen’s 
method. Studies in healthy volunteers provided a much more homogenous and sensitive PK comparability 
model, as prior insulin treatment with lispro was shown to interfere with the performance of immunoreactive 
detection of insulin glargine concentrations in Study ABEE (patients with T1DM). The determination of PK 
equivalence was based on comparing C-peptide corrected insulin concentration-time data: AUC from zero to 24 
hours (AUC[0-24]), the maximum serum study drug concentration (Cmax), and AUC from time zero to infinity 
(AUC[0-∞)). The primary use of AUC is accepted as with relatively flat time-concentration profile, the use of Cmax 
for demonstrating PK equivalence of long-acting insulin products has lower sensitivity in detecting subtle 
differences. 
The CHMP had some concerns because the applicant initially planned to carry out studies only in healthy 
volunteers while endogenous insulin levels can have a significant confounding effect. The CHMP suggested two 
additional studies to address this concern: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/340840/2014 
Page 28/65 
  
  
• 
• 
a clamp study with two different doses “to increase the sensitivity of the study and help judge the magnitude 
of the observed differences, as similar dose-response would add strength to the evidence of biosimilarity”. 
Study ABEM was therefore carried out with the applicant opting to compare the PK/PD response at two 
additional dose levels. This study was powered on the basis of estimates precision and not for any formal 
statistical comparison. 
a study showing similar duration of action in diabetic patients. Study ABEE was therefore conducted in 
patients with T1DM but without formal statistical criteria. 
All formal statistical evaluation for PK comparability was carried out using pre-specified statistical plans and 
conventional objectives to declare PK equivalence only if 90% CI for AUC and other appropriate parameters 
were completely contained within the interval of 0.8-1.25. 
In addition to PK sampling, glucodynamic evaluations using the euglycaemic clamp method were carried out. 
The subjects underwent preparation for the euglycaemic clamp procedure commencing up to 2 hours prior to 
dosing and continued the clamp for up to 24 hours post-dose. The glucose infusion rates (GIRs) required for 
maintaining euglycaemia and blood glucose concentrations as a measure of PD effect were documented 
throughout the procedure. The methodology for automated or manual glucodynamic parameter recording and 
statistical analysis applied to all submitted studies was satisfactory from planning and blinding perspectives. The 
analyses were performed using a locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) function applied to all 
individual GIR versus time profiles in each treatment group. The fitted data for each subject were used to 
calculate the primary PD parameters: maximum glucose infusion rate (Rmax) and total amount of glucose infused 
(Gtot) over the duration of the clamp procedure. For long-acting insulins, clamp duration of at least 24 hours is 
expected but it is agreed that the primary endpoint should be the GIR-AUC over the dosing interval, i.e. 24 hours 
in this case. Therefore, the duration of the clamp studies in healthy volunteers was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
The primary PD parameters (Rmax and Gtot) were log-transformed prior to analysis. For each PD parameter, the 
difference in least-square means along with the 90% CI was back transformed to produce the ratio of geometric 
means and the CI comparing LY2963016 to Lantus. PD comparability was concluded if the 90% CI was 
completely contained within the interval of 0.80 to 1.25. This margin was first chosen for feasibility reasons as 
the choice of a tighter equivalence margin would have resulted in too large sample size, which would not be 
feasible in a single centre; indeed, clamp methodology is specific to clinical sites. Furthermore, due to the 
considerable variation in insulin needs and individual dose adjustment, a tighter equivalence margin is not 
required from a clinical perspective. CHMP guidance requires 95% CIs for PD parameters and statistical analyses 
that exclude the subjects who do not provide evaluable data for both the test and reference products. This 
analysis was initially presented only for the pivotal PK/PD trial, but subsequently for supportive studies as well.

Study ABEM 
Abbreviations: AUC(0-24) = area under the serum concentration versus time curve from zero to 24 hours; AUC(0-inf) = area 
under the serum concentration versus time curve from time zero to infinity; Cmax = maximum serum concentration; Gtot = 
total amount of glucose infused during the clamp procedure; LS = least-squares; Rmax = maximum glucose infusion rate 
during the clamp procedure. 
 a Ratio is Test/Reference where Test = LY2963016 and Reference = EU-approved Lantus 
b subjects who completed all periods of the study and had evaluable data in those periods 
Study ABEI was the first study, which demonstrated a similar relative bioavailability and a comparable PD 
profile for LY2963016 and Lantus at the dose of 0.5 U/kg. The relative bioavailability analysis, based on 
statistical comparisons of AUCs and Cmax established that both PK parameters using correction for baseline 
C-peptide levels were similar but the values derived for LY2963016 were slightly lower than those with Lantus. 
The 90%CI AUC0-∞ ratio was slightly outside the targeted 0.8-1.25 limits (0.77-1.07) but this is not surprising 
given the small sample size of this pilot study and the variability of the half-life determination for a long-acting 
analogue. Likewise, the statistical comparisons of Gtot and Rmax showed 95%CI outside the pre-defined 
0.80-1.25 limits with the ratios of least-square geometric means of 0.95 (0.69-1.32) and 0.94 (90% CI: 
0.68-1.30), respectively. 
Study ABEN was conducted in order to fulfil the purpose of achieving biosimilarity claims for LY2963016 in both 
the EU and US regions and comparing the EU and US reference Lantus materials. The study showed 
unequivocally that AUCs and Cmax were similar between EU and US-approved Lantus products, with ratios of LS 
geometric means between 0.96 to 0.99 for all PK parameters (in all subjects and in completers defined as those 
who completed all treatment periods) and 90%CIs for these parameters fully contained within the pre-specified 
interval 0.80 to 1.25. Furthermore, EU- and US-approved Lantus reference products were shown to be PD 
equivalent in terms of total amount of glucose infused and maximum glucose infusion rate during the 24 hour 
clamp procedure. Hence, the EU and US Lantus reference products were shown to be comparable from the PK 
and PD perspective, thus supporting the use of both products in the efficacy/safety studies.  
Study ABEA was the pivotal trial conducted to demonstrate PK equivalence between 0.5 U/kg SC doses of 
LY2963016 and Lantus. Based on statistical comparisons of AUCs and Cmax, the PK profiles were shown to be

similar with ratios of LS geometric means of 0.91 and 0.95 for the primary parameters AUC(0-24) and Cmax, and 
90% CIs completely contained within the pre-specified interval 0.80 to 1.25. 
Importantly, PK similarity between LY2963016 and Lantus was apparent when either the concentration-time 
data for immunoreactive insulin or C-peptide corrected insulin using Owens method were used for the analysis. 
Additionally, the C-peptide concentration-time profiles were superimposable between LY2963016 and Lantus 
with comparable standard deviations (Figure 5), showing a similar level of suppression of endogenous insulin 
following LY2963016 or Lantus administration and reducing potential errors introduced by any C-peptide 
correction method.

Euglycaemic comparisons of Gtot and Rmax demonstrated similarity in the 24-hour PD profile between LY2963016 
and Lantus with ratios of LS geometric means (0.95 and 0.99, respectively) and 95% CIs (ranging between 0.90 
and 1.05) well contained within 0.80-1.25. Partial GIR-AUCs are meaningful additional PD parameters, which 
were presented following CHMP request; these further confirmed the PD equivalence of both products (data not 
shown). 
In study ABEM, the PK parameters essentially overlapped between LY2963016 and Lantus. Similar PK profiles 
were observed at both 0.3 U/kg and 0.6 U/kg doses. The ratios of geometric LS means for the primary PK 
parameters, AUC(0-24) and Cmax, were 1.03 for both parameters following a 0.3 U/kg dose, and 1.07 and 1.03, 
respectively, following a 0.6 U/kg dose. All the corresponding 90% CIs limits, which ranged between 0.91 and 
1.21, were contained within the interval of 0.80-1.25 when all subjects were considered; however, in the 
analysis of completers, the upper limit of the equivalence interval for the AUC ratio was marginally above it 
(1.27), a result which is compatible with a large confidence interval around a point estimate of 1.07 due to small 
sample size. 
The ratios of the geometric means for the primary PD parameters (Gtot and Rmax) following administration of 
LY2963016 versus Lantus were 1.01 and 1.05, respectively, after a 0.3 U/kg dose, and 0.84 and 0.92, 
respectively, after a 0.6 U/kg dose. The 95% CIs limits ranged between 0.76 and 1.34 for the low dose and 0.61 
to 1.17 for the high dose. While it is acknowledged that the study was not powered to show PK and PD 
equivalence, the results at the low dose (0.3 U/kg) with point estimates close to 1.0 appeared compatible with 
similarity of the test and reference products. In contrast, the results at the high dose (0.6 U/kg) in the same 
subjects suggested a lower effect of LY2963016 compared to Lantus; the comparison of partial GIR-AUCs 
showed that the difference was essentially apparent during the early absorption phase (first 6 hours) with a ratio 
of 0.66 (95%CI 0.44, 1.08) as shown in Table 7. 
After further investigation following CHMP request, the applicant showed that this difference was mainly driven 
by a single subject with an aberrant GIR profile, for which no plausible physiological explanation could be found 
(clamp data at the 0.3 U/kg dose within expected range and PK profile reflecting insulin absorption). A post-hoc 
analysis excluding this single outlier provided ratios of the GIR-AUC geometric means close to 1, except in the 
first 6 hours, but a ratio of 0.77 in the beginning of the clamp experiment was considered by the CHMP to be 
within acceptable limits given the small size of the trial (Table 7).

Study ABEE was carried out in stable T1DM patients who were receiving baseline insulin treatment. The study 
yielded limited PK data and its interpretation was hampered by cross-reactivity with the carried over background 
insulin (especially in the initial portion of the time-concentration curve). The profiles of the concentration curves 
appeared to be similar but no formal PK equivalence was declared as the study was primarily PD in nature and 
its primary objective was to compare the duration of action of LY2963016 and Lantus. Individual patient PK 
profiles appeared similar but not fully overlapping and accompanied with a high degree of variability. PD 
comparability was carried out via the assessment of several parameters describing the duration of action. A 
substantial number (35%) of clamps were terminated at 42 hours, before the end of action was reached. 
Nevertheless, the median duration of action was estimated to be 37.1 and 40.0 hours for LY2963016 and 
Lantus, respectively. A survival type of analysis was carried out and, using a Cox proportional hazard model, the 
hazard ratio (LY2963016/Lantus) was 1.063 with a p-value = 0.8777, supporting the conclusion that there does 
not appear to be a significant difference in the duration of action between LY2963016 and Lantus. 
Statistical analyses of Gtot and Rmax generated ratios of LS geometric means (90% CI) of 0.77 (0.46, 1.30) and 
0.91 (0.52, 1.61), respectively. Although no justification for the width of an acceptable margin was provided, the 
90% CIs overlapped and appeared to support similarity. Other PD parameters characterizing the time profile for

GIR (such as late TRmax50%, late TRmax75%, and Tlast) appeared comparable between LY2963016 and Lantus 
although Tonset (observed time of the first positive GIR post-dose) appeared slightly longer for LY2963016 
compared to Lantus; however, this measure is not accurate as it may be influenced by the effect of the insulin 
lispro infusion during the pre-clamp and early clamp periods. 
Figure 7: PD profile in study ABEE (T1DM patients; 0.3 U/kg) 
Absorption  
Abasria is only administered subcutaneously. Its prolonged duration of action is dependent on its injection into 
subcutaneous tissue, which results in a slow and prolonged absorption, similar to the reference product Lantus.  
Distribution 
As a result of slow absorption, the distribution phase of insulin glargine is long-lasting. No estimate of the 
volume of distribution is available. 
Elimination 
After subcutaneous injection of Abasria, insulin glargine is rapidly metabolized at the carboxyl terminus of the 
beta chain with formation of two active metabolites M1 (21A-Gly-insulin) and M2 
(21A-Gly-des-30B-Thr-insulin). In plasma, the principal circulating compound is the metabolite M1.

Page 36/65 
  
  
 
The median half-life of immunoreactive insulin associated with the terminal rate constant in non-compartmental 
analysis was estimated to be approximately 10 hours. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Pharmacokinetics appeared approximately dose-proportional over the dose range tested (0.3 to 0.6 U/kg). 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No PK interaction studies were performed as these are not required for a similar biological medicinal product. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Insulin glargine is a human insulin analogue designed to have a low solubility at neutral pH. It is completely 
soluble at the acidic pH of the Abasria injection solution. After injection into the subcutaneous tissue, the acidic 
solution is neutralised leading to formation of micro-precipitates from which small amounts of insulin glargine 
are continuously released, providing a smooth, peakless, predictable concentration/time profile with a 
prolonged duration of action. 
In vitro studies indicate that the affinity of insulin glargine and its metabolites M1 and M2 for the human insulin 
receptor is similar to the one of human insulin. 
The primary activity of insulin, including insulin glargine, is regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin and its 
analogues lower blood glucose levels by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and 
fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis in the adipocyte, inhibits proteolysis 
and enhances protein synthesis. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The similarity of the pharmacodynamic actions was investigated using the euglycaemic clamp technique. In this 
assessment report the PD results were summarized and assessed together with PK data. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The assay format (RIA) employed by the applicant for the measurement of insulin glargine concentration is 
considered acceptable; it has recently been published by the manufacturer of Lantus that the response to M1 
(the predominant metabolite) in a selective LC/MS/MS assay measuring separately insulin glargine, M1, and M2 
was similar to that of the combined immunoreactive insulin response of the RIA assay. Furthermore, the assay 
is considered sufficiently sensitive to measure insulin concentrations over 24 hours given the flat PK profile of 
insulin glargine. 
The design of five completed PK/PD studies ABEI, ABEN, ABEM, ABEA and ABEE appears to be satisfactory and 
overall complies with CHMP biosimilar insulin guideline and recommendations given in the CHMP Scientific 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/340840/2014 
Page 37/65 
  
  
 
 
Advice. Although an evaluation over 24 hours does not cover the full PK/PD profile of long-acting insulins, and 
thus, clamp duration of at least 24 hours is expected, the primary endpoints should be the insulin AUC and 
GIR-AUC over the dosing interval, i.e. 24 hours in this case. Therefore, the duration of the clamp studies in 
healthy volunteers is considered acceptable; moreover, the supportive study in patients with T1DM was 
extended well beyond (up to 42 hours). 
PK and PD comparability is the cornerstone on which the biosimilarity is established for new biosimilar insulin 
products and glucodynamic studies using euglycaemic clamp evaluations represent a key tool in achieving this 
objective. PK equivalence of LY2963016 and Lantus has been convincingly demonstrated across all studies and 
all doses using methodology in line with CHMP guidance, including analyses with outliers. 
As for the PD assessment, the pivotal trial demonstrated that LY2963016 has similar effects to Lantus at 0.5 
U/kg based on primary and secondary parameters. Importantly, the actual 95%CIs for the primary parameters 
(Gtot and Rmax) ratios were contained within a much tighter interval (1.0 ± 0.1) than predefined. The comparison 
of the duration of action in patients with T1DM showed high variability but provided supportive evidence of 
similarity. The results from the supportive study requested by the CHMP to investigate two further doses (0.3 
U/kg and 0.6 U/kg) appeared also compatible with a similar PD response, acknowledging that this trial was not 
powered to formally demonstrate PD equivalence. 
In additional analyses provided by the applicant following CHMP request, both PK and PD appeared 
approximately dose-proportional. From these analyses combined with data from the literature, it is likely that 
the 0.5 U/kg dose level is in the linear portion of the dose-response curve. Based on the comparison of the 
slopes of the dose-response relationship for PK or PD parameters, Gtot seemed to be the most sensitive 
parameter to detect differences between the two products. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
PK and PD equivalence of LY2963016 and Lantus has been established based on an extensive comparability 
exercise performed in five studies, which tested several dose levels and were conducted in healthy volunteers as 
well as patients with type 1 diabetes. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Two Phase III clinical studies have been conducted with a similar design, randomised, parallel-group, 
active-comparator, multicentre, multinational studies.  Study ABEB is a 52 week study (24-week treatment 
period and 28-week extension period) in patients with T1DM and study ABEC is a 24-week study in T2DM.  In 
each respective study, the primary outcome was assessed at the end of the 24-week treatment period.  Both 
studies used treat-to-target approaches to achieve the protocol-specified glycaemic goals (for example, HbA1c 
<7.0%, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≤6.0 mmol/L, other pre-prandial capillary BG 3.9 to 7.2 mmol/L without 
incurring hypoglycaemia in Study ABEB; FPG <5.6 mmol/L, HbA1c <7.0% without incurring hypoglycaemia in 
Study ABEC). 
The details of both studies are summarized below.

ABEC 
Study ABEC was a randomized, multinational, multicentre, 2-arm, active-controlled, double-blind, parallel, 
24-week study with a 4-week post-treatment follow-up in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The 
objective of the study was a comparison of LY2963016 to Lantus in combination with oral anti-hyperglycaemic 
medications (OAMs): the ELEMENT 2 Study. The study was conducted at 88 centres in 13 countries.

Study Participants  
ABEB 
Eligible patients had T1DM for at least 1 year based on the disease diagnostic criteria described by the WHO and 
were at least 18 years of age with a body mass index (BMI) of ≤35 kg/m2. Patients had an HbA1c ≤11.0% and 
had been treated with basal-bolus insulin for at least 1 year. Basal insulin had to be once daily injection of human 
insulin isophane suspension (NPH), LANTUS, or detemir for at least 3 months prior to Visit 1 and combined with 
mealtime injections of human regular insulin, or insulin analog lispro, aspart, or glulisine. 
ABEC 
Eligible patients had T2DM based on the disease diagnostic criteria described by the WHO and were at least 18 
years of age with a body mass index of ≤45 kg/m2. Patients had been treated with 2 or more OAMs at stable 
doses for 12 weeks prior to Visit 1, with or without Lantus, and had an HbA1c ≥7.0% and ≤11.0% if insulin naïve, 
or an HbA1c ≤11.0% if previously on Lantus. 
Treatments 
ABEB 
Clinical lots produced in cartridges of LY2963016 were employed in study ABEB. Insulin glargine once-daily was 
started at the same dose and administered at same timing (i.e., daytime or night-time) as the patient’s 
pre-study once daily basal insulin. Insulin lispro was administered with meals at the same dose as the patient’s 
pre-study insulin dose while avoiding hypoglycaemia. The basal and bolus insulin doses were adjusted during 
the study to achieve glycaemic targets (HbA1c <7%, FPG ≤108 mg/dL [6.0 mmol/L], other preprandial capillary 
blood glucose 70 to 130 mg/dL), without incurring hypoglycaemia. The mode of administration was 
subcutaneous. The treatment duration was 52 weeks. 
ABEC  
Clinical lots produced in vials of LY2963016 were employed in study ABEC. Patients previously on Lantus started 
LY2963016 QD at an equivalent dose as pre-study Lantus. Insulin naïve patients had a starting dose of 10 U 
LY2963016 QD. All patients then followed a patient-driven dosing algorithm while being supervised by 
investigators through the course of the study to maintain the fasting blood glucose (FBG) ≤100 mg/dL (5.6 
mmol/L) while avoiding hypoglycaemia. 
Objectives 
ABEB 
The primary objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that LY2963016 once-daily was non-inferior to 
LANTUS (once-daily), as measured by change in HbA1c from baseline to 24 weeks, when used in combination 
with pre-meal insulin lispro administered thrice daily (TID).

EMA/CHMP/340840/2014 
Page 41/65 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The main secondary objectives of the study were: 
−  To  compare  safety  of  LY2963016  relative  to  LANTUS  (e.g.,  incidence  of  anti-insulin  antibodies, 
hypoglycemia, adverse events [AEs]) when used in combination with pre-meal insulin lispro. 
−  To  compare  LY2963016  relative  to  LANTUS  for  other  efficacy  variables  (e.g.,  change  in  HbA1c  at  6 
weeks,  12  weeks,  36  weeks,  and  52  weeks;  7-point  self-monitored  blood  glucose  [SMBG]  profiles; 
percentage of patients with HbA1c <7%, percentage of patients with HbA1c ≤6.5%). 
−  To compare LY2963016 relative to LANTUS with regard to intra-patient blood-glucose (BG) variability, 
basal and prandial (separately and as total daily) insulin dose, and weight when used in combination 
with pre-meal insulin lispro. 
ABEC  
The primary objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that LY2963016 administered once daily 
(QD) was noninferior to LANTUS administered QD, as measured by change in HbA1c from baseline to 24 weeks, 
when used in combination with oral antihyperglycaemic medications (OAMs). 
The main secondary objectives of the study were: 
- 
- 
To  compare  safety  of  LY2963016  relative  to  Lantus  (e.g.,  incidence  of  anti-insulin  antibodies, 
hypoglycemia, adverse events [AEs]) when used in combination with OAMs. 
To compare LY2963016 relative to Lantus for other efficacy variables (e.g., change in HbA1c at 4, 8, 12, 
16, and 20 weeks, 7-point self-monitored blood glucose [SMBG] profiles [as plasma equivalent values], 
percentage of patients with HbA1c <7%, the percentage of patients with HbA1c ≤6.5%).

Sample size 
ABEB 
Based on the primary objective, to show non-inferiority of LY2963016 to Lantus at the 0.4% non-inferiority 
margin, 184 (368 total) completers per arm were needed at 24 weeks. This calculation assumed no treatment 
difference in HbA1c between LY2963016 and LANTUS, common SD of 0.884% for change from baseline in 
HbA1c, 0.05 two-sided significance level, and over 99% power. Assuming a 15% dropout rate at 24 weeks, the 
required number of randomized patients was 216 per arm (432 total). The same sample size was needed to 
show non-inferiority of LY2963016 to LANTUS at the 0.3% noninferiority margin with 90% power. Blinded 
sample-size re-estimation was performed before the last patient had been enrolled in the study. The 
re-estimation used a Bayesian longitudinal model (Fu and Manner 2010) to estimate the variability in the change 
in HbA1c from baseline to the 24-week endpoint using all available patient HbA1c values at the time of data 
cut-off. Since no data was available at 24 weeks, the model was used to impute a final 24-week value for each 
patient; using all early measures of HbA1c that were available. The estimate of 24-week variability was then 
used to recalculate the sample size that was needed to have 90% power for a non-inferiority margin of 0.3%,

assuming no difference between treatments. Although the algorithm predicted that only 400 patients would be 
required, the planned sample size was set to 500 to provide a sufficient number of patients in the safety 
database. 
ABEC 
Based on the primary objective, to show non-inferiority of LY2963016 to Lantus at the 0.4% non-inferiority 
margin, 284 (568 total) completers per arm were needed at 24 weeks. This calculation assumed no treatment 
difference in HbA1c between LY2963016 and Lantus, common SD of 1.1% for change from baseline in HbA1c, 
0.05 two-sided significance level, and over 99% power. Assuming a 15% dropout rate at 24 weeks, the required 
number of randomized patients was 334 per arm (668 total). The same sample size was needed to show 
non-inferiority of LY2963016 to Lantus at the 0.3% non-inferiority margin with 90% power. Blinded sample-size 
re-estimation was performed before the last patient had been enrolled in the study following the same 
methodology as in ABEB. 
Statistical methods 
Efficacy and safety analyses were conducted using the full analysis set (FAS), which included all patients who 
were randomized and had taken at least 1 dose of study medication.  
The primary analysis model was an ANCOVA for the change from baseline HbA1c to endpoint with the 
randomisation stratification factors and treatment as fixed effects and baseline HbA1c as a covariate.

Overall, the incidence of discontinuations in the LY2963016 arm (15 patients [5.6%]) was similar to the LANTUS 
arm (11 patients [4.1%]), p=0.547). The most common reason  for study discontinuation in both arms  was 
withdrawal by subject.

Overall,  the  incidence  of  discontinuations  in  the  LY2963016  arm  (42  patients  [11.2%])  was  similar  to  the 
LANTUS  arm  (52  patients  [13.7%]),  p=0.322.  The  most  common  reason  for  study  discontinuation  in  both 
groups was subject decision (LY2963016: 11 patients [2.9%]; LANTUS: 16 patients [4.2%]). 
Baseline data 
For both studies, demographic and baseline characteristics were generally balanced between treatment arms.

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
For the purpose of the clinical biosimilarity exercise for biosimilar insulin products, the CHMP is of the view that 
the evaluation of HBA1c is not a sensitive endpoint and therefore efficacy studies evaluating HBA1c are not 
generally anticipated (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/2005). However, the applicant has conducted two phase III 
non-inferiority studies comparing the test and reference product in order to investigate how PK/PD features of 
the biosimilar product translate into clinical parameters relevant for the management of patients with Type 1 
and 2 DM. Furthermore, both efficacy studies provide the safety and immunogenicity datasets that are still 
required by the CHMP guideline. 
In general, according to EU biosimilar guidelines, equivalence trials are expected but subject to appropriate 
clinical and scientific justifications, a non-inferiority approach can be accepted. The applicant has adequately 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/340840/2014 
Page 50/65 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
justified the non-inferiority margin of 0.3% for HbA1c, both from a statistical and clinical standpoint. Given the 
supportive role of these phase III studies in the biosimilar programme, the statistical methodology for these 
studies does not raise major concerns. 
The choice of the patient population, i.e. well-controlled Type 1 DM managed on Lantus, NPH insulin or insulin 
detemir for at least 1 year (study ABEB) and well-controlled patients with Type 2 DM managed on oral 
antiglycaemic agents and who were either insulin-naïve or previously treated with Lantus patients (study ABEC), 
sufficiently covers and represents the paradigm of current management of diabetes with long-acting insulins. 
Given the primary endpoint at 24 weeks and that collection of self-monitored blood glucose levels and insulin 
dosages were carried out, these studies provide additional supportive value to the PK/PD comparability 
programme conducted in healthy volunteers and T1DM patients.  
Both trials were conducted in numerous European and US sites but also included sites in Japan, Mexico, South 
Korea, and Taiwan. Provided results are shown to be similar across geographical regions, this is acceptable in 
the context of a biosimilar application. Overall, the conduct of both studies was acceptable and there were no 
notable findings that could have impacted on the robustness of clinical findings and conclusions. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Patient demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced across treatment arms, except for a 
statistically significant imbalance in the proportion of patients with HbA1c >7% in the LY2963016 arm compared 
to the Lantus arm in study ABEB. In order to account for this baseline imbalance, the applicant has carried out 
post-hoc analysis of the primary endpoint with similar non-inferiority conclusion as in the pre-specified analysis. 
Based on the data provided, non-inferiority of LY2963016 to Lantus was demonstrated in both studies using 
both FAS and PP datasets. Actual results showed an upper limit of the 95% CI being less than 0.25% in both 
clinical trials, which is substantially less than 0.3%. 
Overall, the results of other secondary endpoints were consistent with the results of the primary endpoint. Some 
differences were identified in both studies but they were not considered clinically relevant when the results of 
the two studies were taken together. 
Study ABEB 
Patients in the LY2963016 arm had statistically significantly lower mean BG values at bedtime and 3 am 
compared with the Lantus arm; however, the mean difference between treatment arms was small and unlikely 
to result in clinically meaningful differences, as reflected by no difference in nocturnal hypoglycaemia. There 
were no statistically significant differences between treatment arms in mean FBG (morning pre-meal) values, 
daily mean pre-meal or post-prandial BG values, and the daily mean BG values. Additionally, this finding was not 
replicated in study ABEC. 
Study ABEC 
• 
• 
The LS mean BG value was lower in the LY2963016 arm at the morning 2-hour post-prandial time point and 
statistically significantly lower at the midday pre-meal time point compared with the Lantus arm although 
there were no statistically significant differences between treatment arms in the morning pre-meal BG 
values, the daily mean BG values, the daily mean pre-meal and post-prandial BG values, or in the bedtime 
to 3 am excursion. 
The increases in LS mean body weight from baseline were statistically significantly smaller in the LY2963016 
arm compared with the Lantus arm at Week 2, Week 4 and Week 20. There were no statistically significant

Page 51/65 
  
  
differences in body weight changes at any other visit or endpoint (LOCF). Baseline differences in body 
weight and insulin doses may have confounded early weight gain at Week 2 and 4. Furthermore, the 
differences were small (< 0.5 kg) and this finding was not replicated in patients with T1DM. 
•  At 24 weeks, the proportion of patients achieving HbA1c <6.5% was 26.8% in LY2963016 and 30.4% in 
Lantus groups respectively, whilst at the baseline the proportions were 3.5% and 2.4%, respectively. 
Similarly at baseline in study ABEC, the proportion of patients with <7.0% HBA1c was 6.2% in LY2963016 
and 7.2% in Lantus arms but at 24 weeks there was a modest trend for reduction of the proportion in 
LY2963016 group (48.8% vs. 52.5%). A supplemental subgroup analysis of HbA1c evolution according to 
baseline HbA1c levels (< 7% and ≥ 7%), considered more sensitive than the responder analysis, was 
provided. In the largest subgroup of subjects with baseline HbA1c level ≥7%, the difference in HbA1c 
decrease was very small (mean 0.02%; 95%CI -0.13%, +0.18%) and clearly below differences that can be 
considered clinically meaningful. 
Finally, to further support the similarity of the PD effects at high doses, an additional analysis of the 
self-monitored blood glucose profiles was performed in both clinical studies; it showed comparable glucose 
levels with LY2963016 and Lantus in the subgroup of patients receiving doses of insulin glargine ≥ 0.6 U/kg/d, 
in particular during the first hours following the injection. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Two clinical studies conducted in patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes demonstrated that LY2963016 is 
non-inferior to Lantus in achieving HBA1c at week 24 and therefore provided strong supportive evidence about 
the comparability of the two products. Importantly, both studies provided data on patients switching from 
Lantus to LY2963016 at the same dose regimen; no difference in dose changes after titration to tighten glucose 
blood control was reported between the two treatment arms. The study in type 1 diabetes was pursued up to 52 
weeks and non-inferiority of LY2963016 to Lantus was confirmed at this further time point. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Overall, 446 patients with T1DM and T2DM were exposed for at least 6 months within the integrated dataset 
composed of ABEB and ABEC studies. The total amount of comparative data up to 6 months is adequate. In 
addition, 499/643 patients were of Caucasian origin and there was a substantial subset of patients ≥65 years of 
age with only few patients exposed in the age group of >75 years.

Adverse events 
There were no imbalances in the presentation of adverse events, treatment-related adverse events, study 
discontinuations, hypoglycaemic episodes and injection site reactions between LY2963016 and Lantus arms in 
the phase I studies (ABEA, ABEM, ABEE and ABEI). The preliminary safety profile of LY2963016 established 
during the phase I studies appeared very similar that of Lantus and was considered acceptable. 
Subsequently, the safety profile of LY2963016 was comprehensively evaluated during the 6-month comparative 
phase of studies ABEB and ABEC.

b  Deaths are also included as serious adverse events and discontinuations due to adverse events. 
c  As assessed by the investigator. 
The incidence and the pattern of identified AEs and TEAEs with LY2963016 appeared to be very similar to those 
with Lantus. The incidence of hypoglycaemic, allergic and post-injection site reactions was well balanced 
between treatment arms in each study. 
The analysis of hypoglycaemic events was very comprehensive and followed the framework of both US and EU 
diabetes guidelines. The analysis included asymptomatic, relative, and nocturnal hypoglycaemic events. The 
total number of hypoglycaemic events was numerically lower with LY2963016 compared to Lantus in both 
studies, including the number of severe hypoglycaemic events. The total number of nocturnal hypoglycaemic 
events was also numerically lower with LY2963016 compared to Lantus in both studies: ABEB: 2301 events with 
LY2963016 in 222 patients vs. 2347 events in 216 patients on Lantus; ABEC: 1248 events with LY2963016 in 
212 patients vs. 1386 events in 203 patients on Lantus. Of note, the total incidence of hypoglycaemic attacks 
was found to be greater in study ABEB where all patients were insulin-dependent and this is expected as 
opposed to a lower incidence of these events in T2DM patients of study ABEC where a significant proportion of 
patients were insulin-naïve at entry into the study. 
In the 52-week report of study ABEB, an estimated difference of ~3 events/year of hypoglycaemia with BG ≤70 
mg/dL was not considered clinically meaningful. Of note, the baseline hypoglycaemia rates were also lower in 
the LY2963016 arm (8.4/month) than in the Lantus arm (9.3/month). With a more stringent definition (<54 
mg/dL), no difference between the two treatment arms was observed. Likewise, in the double-blind study ABEC, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/340840/2014 
Page 54/65 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
the estimated difference at 24 weeks was even smaller (~1 event/year of hypoglycaemia with BG ≤70 mg/dL) 
with no difference in documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia. 
The pattern of allergic events was evaluated in a blinded fashion and was based on a thorough skin evaluation 
questionnaire. The number of allergic events and injection site-related abnormalities appeared similar between 
the two insulins and considered acceptable. In the 52-week follow-up of study ABEB, 20 patients (7.5%) in the 
LY2963016 arm and 11 patients (4.1%) in the Lantus arm reported treatment-emergent allergic events. 
The applicant tabulated all cases of neoplasia reported during the development programme and there were no 
imbalances that would raise any new concerns. The theoretical risk of tumorogenicity with Lantus has been 
evaluated in numerous post-marketing studies and extensively discussed at CHMP and PRAC in the past. It was 
agreed that no new studies are required but that the risk has to be monitored and included in the RMP. The 
applicant has implemented the risk of neoplasia into the RMP and based on the lack of any unanticipated signals 
in studies ABEC and ABEB, it is considered that passive post-marketing surveillance for neoplastic events with 
biosimilar LY2963016 will be sufficient. 
The only imbalance identified in the main studies was a higher number of events in the vascular SOC with 
LY2963016 and this observation was confined entirely to study ABEC: 21 patients (5.6%) vs. 9 patients (2.4%). 
This imbalance was driven by a baseline imbalance in the number of patients with pre-existing hypertension 
randomised into the LY2963016 arm of study ABEC. The applicant has conducted a number of safety analyses 
including evaluations of systolic and diastolic blood pressure and thorough examination of pre-existing medical 
histories of affected patients. It is evident that, in the absence of mechanistic association between insulin 
signalling pathways and vascular tone, the lack of documented risk with the reference product and therefore an 
absence of plausible biological and clinical causal link, there is a high probability of confounding of the safety 
profile of insulin products with numerous co-morbidities well-recognised in diabetes mellitus. Finally, the slightly 
lower frequency of vascular AEs in study ABEB over 52 weeks of follow-up (27.6% with LY2963016 vs. 29.6% 
with Lantus) also suggests that the finding in study ABEC is a chance finding possibly driven by the baseline 
imbalance of patients with pre-existing hypertension. 
In summary, the safety profile of LY2963016 appeared to be similar to that of Lantus and in line with the safety 
characteristics expected from an insulin product. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were no imbalances in the number of SAEs and deaths reported. The number of SAEs with LY2963016 was 
numerically lower than with Lantus. The occurrence of hypoglycaemia, the most frequent SAE, was similar with 
both treatments. 
There were a total of 3 deaths in the Phase III studies. In study ABEB, one death was reported at Week 30 in a 
patient on Lantus. Two deaths were reported in study ABEC: 1 case on Lantus and 1 case on LY2963016. The 
narratives do not raise any treatment-related concerns. 
Laboratory findings 
Laboratory measurements were collected at baseline and Week 24 in both studies. None of the differences were 
found to be clinically relevant or raised new concerns. There were no AEs related to changes in vital signs and 
ECG findings.

Immunological events 
In studies ABEB and ABEC, patient samples were analysed for anti-insulin antibodies, including those 
cross-reacting with human insulin. In study ABEB, the proportion of patients with detectable anti-insulin 
antibodies at any time over the 24-week period was 29.8% in the LY2963016 arm vs. 33.7% in the Lantus arm; 
in study ABEC, 15.3% in the LY2963016 arm vs. 11.0% in the Lantus arm (see Table 14). 
Table 14:  Proportion of patients with detectable antibodies: Summary at baseline, 24-week 
endpoint (LOCF), and overall in studies ABEB & ABEC 
The applicant presented further analyses of treatment-emergent immune responses using arbitrarily 
pre-defined definitions, which suggested potential differences between LY2963016 and Lantus. 
The CHMP considered that, for the purpose of comparing the immunogenicity of the test and reference products, 
the evaluation of the incidence and quantitative measurement of antibodies over time using the continuous 
variable of percent binding (% B/T) is more informative and accurate than an assessment of the immune 
response based on arbitrarily selected criteria. Therefore, additional antibody analyses were requested to 
further compare the immunogenicity profile of the two products up to 52 weeks in study ABEB, to present data 
separately in patients already treated with Lantus prior to trial entry vs. other basal insulin (study ABEB) or 
insulin-naïve patients (study ABEC), and to present a quantitative evaluation of total and cross-reactive 
antibody levels over time (% B/T). 
The proportion of patients with detectable antibodies was comparable throughout both studies, with the 
exception of a significant overall difference in the subgroup of patients with T2DM that were previously treated 
with Lantus (see Table 15). 
The median antibody levels remained low throughout both studies, with no significant differences between 
treatment arms regardless of previous insulin treatment. Figure 12 presents these data for the subgroup of 
patients treated with Lantus prior to study entry in both trials.

The data for cross-reactive antibodies appeared similar to that of total antibodies. The majority (approximately 
70% to 100%) of detectable antibodies in both treatment arms were cross-reactive throughout the studies (data 
not shown).

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
There is no expectation that a development programme for a biosimilar candidate would evaluate various 
drug-drug interactions previously reported with the reference medicinal product. The section 4.5 of Lantus 
SmPC contains a number of potential drug-related effects on treatment with Lantus. These are equally relevant 
and are transferrable into the SmPC of Abasria. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The discontinuations due to treatment-related AEs were numerically higher with Lantus compared to 
LY2963016. There was no unusual pattern that warrants further action.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Extensive comparative safety data have been provided, up to 6 months in one study and 12 months in the other 
study. There was a substantial subset of patients ≥65 years of age, especially with T2DM, with only few patients 
exposed in the age group of >75 years. This is acceptable as there is no expectation that all different age groups 
or special populations should be included into the biosimilar development programme. The objective of the 
biosimilar development is to demonstrate the similarity in safety profile but not to reassess the safety profile of 
the reference medicinal product. 
The incidence and pattern of identified AEs and TEAEs to LY2963016 appeared to be very similar to those with 
Lantus; the incidence of hypoglycaemic, allergic and post-injection site reactions was well balanced between 
treatment arms in each study. 
Although the total number of hypoglycaemic events was numerically lower with LY2963016 compared to Lantus 
in both studies, the estimated difference in the 52-week update of study ABEB was approximately 3 events per 
year, which is not considered clinically meaningful. Likewise, in the double-blind study ABEC, the estimated 
difference at 24 weeks was smaller (~1 event/year) with no difference in documented symptomatic 
hypoglycaemia. 
The number of allergic reactions and injection site-related abnormalities appeared broadly similar between the 
two insulins and considered acceptable. There were no severe or life-threatening allergic reactions reported. 
There were several cases of malignancies, which were balanced between treatment arms. There were no 
imbalances in the number of SAEs and deaths. 
The most sensitive population with regard to immunogenicity is the population of patients with type 1 diabetes. 
Study ABEB showed that LY2963016 and Lantus had comparable immunogenicity profiles up to 52 weeks, in 
terms of incidence and level of anti-insulin antibodies (both total and cross-reactive with human insulin). 
Patients with type 2 diabetes tend to develop anti-insulin antibodies infrequently, and therefore, the numbers 
involved in study ABEC were much smaller. While no difference in immune response was shown in insulin-naïve 
patients, a difference in antibody incidence was detected in the subgroup of patients that were on Lantus prior 
to study entry. However, this is likely a chance finding as there was already a difference at baseline, no 
difference in antibody levels was detected, and this observation was not corroborated by the data from study 
ABEB in a larger and more sensitive population. 
For insulin analogues in general, an impact of anti-insulin antibodies on efficacy or safety has only been 
occasionally reported. In the two clinical studies, antibodies did not appear to have any influence on efficacy and 
Assessment report

safety outcomes (HbA1c, weight, insulin dose, hypoglycaemic episodes, allergic or injection site reactions) and 
no consistent differences between the two products were observed. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of LY2963016 has been well characterised in the context of the biosimilarity exercise. It 
appeared comparable to the safety profile of Lantus in the clinical studies and in line with the profile established 
and documented with the reference product. There were no major safety findings or signals identified in the 
clinical programme. 
Furthermore, extensive immunogenicity evaluation in two large studies, which covered both types of diabetic 
population, showed that the antibody profiles of LY2963016 and Lantus were comparable. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the legislative 
requirements. 
2.8.  Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 1.4, the PRAC considers by consensus that the 
risk management system for insulin glargine LY2963016 (Abasria) in the treatment of proposed indication is 
acceptable.   
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
The applicant implemented the changes in the Risk Management Plan as requested by PRAC. 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 1.4 with the following content:

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
In the development of a biosimilar product, there is no requirement to demonstrate benefit to the patient per se 
as this has been shown for the reference product.  The benefits and risks are inferred from the similarity of the 
test product to the reference product in terms of quality, efficacy and safety. 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
From a quality perspective: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Physico-chemical characterisation has demonstrated biosimilar comparability between LY2963016 and the 
reference medicinal product (EU-approved Lantus) for the primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary 
structure. 
LY2963016 and Lantus were comparable in the average relative potency assay when batches of LY2963016 
from Lilly (France) and a contract manufacturer (USA) were compared directly with EU-approved Lantus or 
US-approved Lantus. Biological identity test data from LY2963016 finished product and Lantus were also 
demonstrated to be comparable in batches tested concurrently. 
LY2963016 has the same quantitative formulation as Lantus, with comparable levels of metacresol and zinc, 
also similar pH. 
Levels of total impurities and HMWP were comparable in LY2963016 and Lantus. 
•  Comparable chromatographic profiles were demonstrated for LY2963016 and Lantus, except for low levels 
of an impurity in LY2963016.  This product-related impurity was shown to be active in the reporter gene 
assay and was qualified in toxicology studies.  This impurity is controlled in the purification process. 
• 
LY2963016 finished product and Lantus have similar in vitro precipitation characteristics under physiological 
conditions. 
From a non-clinical perspective: 
• 
The data from the binding affinity, functional, metabolic potency and rat hepatoma mitogenesis assays 
showed that LY2963016 is similar to EU-approved Lantus. 
From a clinical perspective: 
• 
• 
• 
In single dose cross-over studies ABEA and ABEM conducted in healthy volunteers the PK parameters for 
LY2963016 and Lantus adjusted for baseline C-peptide levels established biosimilarity based on 90% 
confidence intervals for the ratios of both primary parameters (Cmax and AUC0-24), which were well contained 
within the standard bioequivalence interval of 0.80 – 1.25. 
In the pivotal ABEA study, euglycaemic clamp glucodynamic evaluations established PD similarity following 
a single dose of 0.5 U/kg based on 95% confidence intervals for the ratios of both primary parameters (Gtot 
and Rmax), which were well contained within 0.80-1.25. 
These pivotal PD data were supported by similar PD results at the dose of 0.3 U/kg in study ABEM (despite 
insufficient study power) and similar duration of action in patients with T1DM.

•  Both efficacy studies in type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus met their primary objective, i.e. showed that 
LY2963016 was non-inferior to Lantus based on the change in HbA1c from baseline to the 24-week time 
point using an acceptable margin of 0.3% in both the FAS and PP populations. In both studies, significant 
(p<0.001) reductions in HbA1c at 24 weeks were achieved with the two products. Likewise, non-inferiority 
of LY2963016 to Lantus was confirmed at the final time point (52 weeks) of study ABEB in T1DM patients. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
From a quality perspective: 
• 
Low levels of citrate were detected in the Lantus samples (both EU and US Lantus) by NMR, which is not 
present in LY2963016. 
•  Differences were observed in the degradation pathways under accelerated conditions, although no 
differences were observed under long term storage conditions. 
From a non-clinical perspective: 
•  Differences were initially observed in the functional activity for stimulating auto-phosphorylation of the 
human insulin receptor IR-A, but pooling of datasets from several studies has indicated that the differences 
observed with this sensitive assay were not of biological significance. 
From a clinical perspective: 
•  At the highest dose tested (0.6 U/kg), PD results in healthy volunteers suggested potentially lower activity 
of LY2963016 compared to Lantus, especially in the first hours following injection. However, this observation 
was largely driven by a single subject, for whom no plausible physiological explanation could be found, and 
a post-hoc analysis without this single outlier showed comparable effects taking into account the small size 
of this supportive study. 
• 
To further confirm the similarity of the PD effects at high doses, an additional analysis of the self-monitored 
blood glucose profiles was performed in both clinical studies; it showed comparable glucose levels with 
LY2963016 and Lantus in the subgroup of patients receiving insulin doses ≥ 0.6 U/kg/d, in particular during 
the first hours following the injection. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
LY2963016 exhibited a safety profile comparable to that of Lantus in large clinical trials up to 52 weeks. The type 
and incidence of ADRs were broadly comparable and in line with those expected on the basis of the Lantus 
SmPC. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The initial immunogenicity assessment suggested that LY2963016 might be slightly more immunogenic than 
Lantus but this was based on an arbitrary definition of immune response. Extensive and more relevant analyses

of the incidence and quantitative measurement of anti-insulin antibodies did not show any meaningful difference 
in the immunogenicity profile of the two products, especially in the most sensitive population of patients with 
type 1 diabetes followed up to 12 months. Furthermore, these antibodies did not show any impact on efficacy 
and safety outcomes. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Minor quality differences are expected to be observed between a biosimilar and its reference product; they are 
acceptable as long as they do not impact on efficacy and safety. 
All major physicochemical characteristics and biological activities of LY2963016 were shown to be comparable to 
those of Lantus, with only small differences observed which are attributed to the presence of low levels of citrate 
in Lantus. 
Furthermore, an extensive clinical programme, including five PK/PD studies and two efficacy/safety studies, did 
not reveal any relevant difference between LY2963016 and Lantus. 
Benefit-risk balance 
For a biosimilar, the benefit-risk balance is based on the totality of evidence collected from the quality, 
non-clinical, and clinical comparability exercise. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Several PK/PD studies, which are considered the cornerstone of the clinical comparability exercise for insulin 
analogues, have established equivalence between the PK and PD profiles of LY2963016 and Lantus. In addition, 
two clinical studies conducted in patients with both types of diabetes mellitus have confirmed that the efficacy, 
safety and immunogenicity profiles of the two products were comparable.

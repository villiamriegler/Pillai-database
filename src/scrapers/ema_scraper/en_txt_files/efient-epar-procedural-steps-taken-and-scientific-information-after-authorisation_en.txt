The TADF (ACCOAST) study showed that there was no 
in order to optimize the instructions with regard to 
the timing of the loading dose of prasugrel in 
patients with non-ST segment elevation myocardial 
infarction undergoing percutaneous coronary 
intervention based on data from TADF (ACCOAST) 
Study and ALKK PCI registry (Study B008).

benefit in non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction 
(NSTEMI) patients with elevated troponin who received a 
30 mg loading dose prior to coronary angiography followed 
by a 30 mg loading dose at the time of percutaneous 
coronary intervention (PCI) compared to patients who 
received the conventional 60 mg loading dose at the time 
of the PCI. On the contrary, the experimental pre-
treatment regimen was associated with a significantly 
increased risk of TIMI major bleedings compared to the 
conventional regimen. The higher rate in the pre-treatment 
group was driven by the non-CABG-related bleedings in the 
PCI-only group during the first 7 days following the first 
loading dose. The German registry study showed that at 
least in some regions of Europe it is common practice to 
administer the loading dose of prasugrel prior to coronary 
angiography in an unstable angina (UA)/NSTEMI 
population. Even if this did not appear to increase the 
bleeding rate compared to patients receiving the loading 
dose after coronary visualisation in this particular study, it 
is a somewhat worrying finding given the similarities of the 
used front-loading regimen with the experimental arm in 
the TADF study. Consequently, the changes to the SmPC 
were introduced to reflect the results of the TADF study to 
inform the healthcare providers on increased risk of serious

Although bleeding was increased with prasugrel, an

cause, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, and non-CABG-related 
bleeding in UA/NSTEMI patients undergoing PCI when 
prasugrel is administered prior to diagnostic coronary 
angiography. 
TIMI major haemorrhage favored prasugrel compared to 
clopidogrel (HR = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.79 to 0.95; p = 0.004). 
In TRITON, for every 1000 patients treated with prasugrel, 
there were 22 fewer patients with MI, and 5 more with 
non–CABG-related TIMI major haemorrhages, compared 
with patients treated with clopidogrel. The TRILOGY study 
showed the relative safety of the 5 mg MD in those patients 
at increased risk of bleeding (although TRILOGY did not 
show superior efficacy of prasugrel versus clopidogrel in the 
ACS-MM population). Thus, the overall benefit/risk profile 
for prasugrel is favorable, particularly given that prasugrel 
achieved significant superiority over clopidogrel, an active 
comparator already demonstrated to be safe and effective 
in the setting of ACS managed by PCI (CURE 2001; PCI-
CURE Mehta et al. 2001). The CHMP concluded that the 
safety profile for prasugrel remains unchanged. 
Based upon the data that have become available since the 
granting of the initial Marketing Authorisation, the CHMP 
considers that the benefit-risk balance of prasugrel remains 
positive. The CHMP recommends that the renewal be 
granted with unlimited validity.

In order to provide more data on switching between 
the data from the completed pharmacodynamic 
study (TAEH) regarding the use of prasugrel in 
clopidogrel and prasugrel, the pharmacodynamic data from 
276 patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) managed

patients previously receiving clopidogrel. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were 
analysed. Switching from an initial loading dose of 600 mg 
clopidogrel or placebo administered upon presentation to 
the hospital prior to coronary angiography to a 60 mg 
loading dose of prasugrel administered at the time of 
percutaneous coronary intervention, resulted in a similar 
increased inhibition of platelet aggregation for the 72 hour 
duration of the study.

Furthermore, section 4.3 of the SmPC and Annex II

latest QRD template.

prasugrel in patients > 75 years old and patients < 60 kg. 
The first two studies evaluated the 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) data and the 
third one evaluated the efficacy and safety of 5 and 10 mg 
of prasugrel during 30 months. The conclusion is that the 
use of 5 mg prasugrel in patients aged > 75 years or with a 
weight of < 60 kg is effective and safe.

levels of platelet inhibition are achieved with prasugrel 
compared to clopidogrel, and that prasugrel 60-mg loading 
dose/10-mg maintenance dose is an appropriate dose 
regimen in Asian subjects who weigh at least 60 kg and are 
less than 75 years of age. 
The conducted study does not suggest the subjects of Asian 
origin be at an increased risk of adverse reactions to 
prasugrel. The study did not identify any pharmacogenetic 
biomarkers associated with efficacy or adverse events. 
Therefore a warning that therapeutic experience is limited 
in Asian patients and the product should be used with 
caution in this population of patients was deleted.

reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions including 
angioedema in patients receiving prasugrel, including in 
patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to 
clopidogrel. Therefore, based on these reports it was 
agreed to strengthen the wording so that angioedema is

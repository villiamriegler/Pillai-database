2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Sialorrhoea or drooling is the unintentional loss of saliva from the mouth and is a normal phenomenon in 
infancy. As neurological control of the tongue and bulbar musculature develops, excessive drooling normally 
stops around the age of 15-18 months of age. However, a high number of developing children will continue to 
drool until 3 years of age, especially during periods of eating or drinking (Mier et al 2000). Drooling beyond 
the age of 4 years of age is considered neurodevelopmentally abnormal (Fairhurst and Cockerill 2011).  
The diagnosis of sialorrhoea before 2 years of age is inappropriate, irrespective of the presence of an 
underlying neurological disorder. Most children in this age group would be more appropriately treated with a 
less invasive behavioural approach, at least initially.  
Pathological drooling is common in children and adults with CP, but most frequently in individuals who are 
also developmentally disabled. Other rarer and often more debilitating neurological disorders and 
neurodegenerative diseases can also be associated with sialorrhoea, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 10/143 
  
  
 
 
 
Rett syndrome, Angelman syndrome, and epilepsy. The risk for occurrence and/or increased severity of 
drooling in any child with a neurological disorder can be made worse by several concomitant medications 
commonly administered in these populations including anticonvulsants such as clobazam and clonazepam and 
neuroleptic drugs. 
The pathophysiology of sialorrhoea is not clear. However, the following five factors have an impact on the 
complex and coordinated process of swallowing and are thought to contribute in varying degrees to drooling 
in individuals with neurological disorders (Blasco 1992; Mier 2000): 
• 
Integrity of oral structures; 
•  Oropharyngeal motor function; 
•  Orofacial sensory perception and feedback; 
•  Rate of saliva secretion; and 
•  Cognitive awareness of salivary spill. 
Saliva production and swallowing is an automatic act. However, it is dependent on the ability to feel the 
build-up of saliva within the mouth and relies upon the normal movement of the tongue to collect it and 
transfer it to the back of the mouth for swallowing. A child will typically produce 1-1.5 liters of salvia 
everyday with the production predominantly occurring in three pairs of salivary glands: the submandibular, 
sublingual and parotid. The submandibular glands account for 65-70% of unstimulated production of saliva so 
are the primary source of saliva in sialorrhoea (Fairhurst 2011, Erasmus 2009). 
Uncontrolled sialorrhoea can have negative consequences for health and quality of life (QoL) (Parr, 2014; 
Fairhurst, 2011; Mier, 2000; Harris, 1987; Hockstein, 2004; Van De Heyning, 1980; Van der Burg, 2006). 
Detrimental effects may include: 
• 
Irritated and macerated skin 
•  Dehydration 
•  Constant wetness and foul odour of clothing 
• 
• 
Interference with interpersonal relationships, e.g. poor speech intelligibility restricting communication 
between child and parent 
Lowering of self-esteem 
•  Restricted vocational options 
In addition to these external manifestations of drooling, children with the most severe pharyngeal dysphagia 
are at medical risk due to saliva aspiration to the lungs, which can lead to recurrent episodes of pneumonia 
(Erasmus, 2012). 
Several non-invasive options are available as a first-line management of sialorrhoea (directed at the cause), 
such as practical aids, speech therapy, physiotherapy.  
Further therapeutic options of increasing invasiveness exist, such as anticholinergic medication, botulinum 
toxin or surgical removal or ligation of some of the salivary glands. 
At present, there is insufficient evidence to be able to distinguish between these different approaches, though 
it is clear that none of them is completely successful in all individuals. Currently, the most comprehensive 
Assessment report

management guidelines for the treatment of sialorrhoea are those that were published by UK clinicians in 
2011 (Fairhurst 2011). In these guidelines each of the available treatment options was reviewed including 
glycopyrronium bromide, hyoscine patches and benzhexol. These guidelines are supplemented by recently 
published UK paediatric formularies, including the standard reference book Paediatric Palliative Medicine 
(2010) (Hain, 2010) and 2012 edition of the Association of Paediatric Palliative Medicine (APPM) Master 
Formulary (APPM, 2012) both recommend GP for the management of sialorrhoea. Furthermore, GP is 
included in expert recommendations (Erasmus, 2012) in the Netherlands as a treatment option for individuals 
with CP requiring drooling control who are not suitable for botulinum toxin therapy or surgery. 
Drug therapy is aimed at decreasing the volume of saliva without addressing impaired swallowing. 
Historically, a range of drugs with anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) actions have been used in an attempt to 
control sialorrhoea.  
Anticholinergic drugs work by decreasing the volume of saliva secreted from the salivary glands and thus the 
severity of drooling. Hyoscine (scopolamine), benztropine mesylate and benzhexol have all been shown to be 
useful for controlling drooling in children with neurological disorders. However, their lack of selectivity leads 
to widespread, undesirable, and often poorly tolerated central and peripheral effects, including restlessness, 
irritability, drowsiness, constipation, urinary retention, and flushing.  
GP is a quaternary ammonium member of the anticholinergic class of drugs, which has been demonstrated to 
be effective in reducing sialorrhoea. As a consequence of its quaternary charge, GP has limited ability to 
penetrate the blood brain barrier. Therefore, there is an widely held belief that, compared with other 
anticholinergic drugs, children treated with GP will exhibit a better tolerated safety profile, though the results 
of a clinical study (Parr, 2014) investigating this possibility have yet to be reported. 
There are currently no approved products in EU for the treatment of excessive drooling (sialorrhoea). 
However, in the European Union, several different anticholinergic drugs are commonly used off-label for the 
pharmacological treatment of sialorrhoea including atropine and, especially, GP and hyoscine. Dosing of GP is 
by body weight (mg/kg) using a dose titration scheme. The total daily dose in clinical practice is reported to 
be in the range 0.06 - 0.3 g/kg/day, often split into 2 to 3 doses (Proveca, 2012). For hyoscine patches dose 
adjustment is often achieved by cutting up and applying only part of a patch for 72 hours. This can result in 
leakage of drug, giving a high dose in the first day and little drug for the following 48 hours. 
The absence of a paediatric-appropriate formulation licensed for the treatment of sialorrhoea currently 
represents an impediment to effective treatment of this distressing condition.  
About the product 
Glycopyrronium bromide is a water-soluble synthetic quaternary amine. It is a peripheral antimuscarinic 
(anticholinergic) agent. GP acts as a competitive antagonist at muscarinic receptors in the autonomic nervous 
system. One of the pharmacological actions of all anticholinergic drugs is the reduction of secretions through 
antagonism of cholinergic M3 stimulation (Tscheng et al. 2002). GP, administered via the intravenous (i.v.), 
intramuscular (i.m.), and oral routes, has been shown to reduce salivary secretions in healthy adult 
volunteers (Mirakhur, 1978a; Mirakhur, 1980) and surgical patients (Mirakhur, 1979b; Ali-Melkkilä, 1989; Ali-
Melkkilä, 1990a). Compared with atropine, GP is selective and 6-times more potent with a longer duration of 
effect on salivary secretions.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 12/143 
  
  
 
 
Glycopyrronium bromide has affinity at all five human muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor subtypes (Ki = 
0.15 – 2.0 nM) in order M1 > M3 > M2/M4 > M5. GP is 2-4 times more selective for the M3 and M1 subtypes 
than M2, making it one of the most potent M3 blockers available (Bird et al. 2011).  
The applied dose is based on the weight of the child, starting with approximately 0.02 mg/kg per dose, three 
times per day and increasing by 0.02 mg/kg per dose every 7 days. Dose titration should be continued until 
efficacy is balanced with side effects and amended up or down as appropriate, to a maximum individual dose 
of 7.5 ml (3.0 mg) three times a day.  
The applied indication is:  
Treatment of sialorrhoea (chronic pathological drooling) in children aged 2 to <18 years with neurological 
disorders.

been in well-established medicinal use for at least 10 years in the Union, with a “recognised efficacy and an 
acceptable level of safety” in the applied indication.  
It appears that the use of the substance in the European Union in the applied indication has been extremely 
limited, except in the United Kingdom where the applicant provided the following evidence of use. It has been 
included in the British National Formulary for Children (BNFc) for the past 10 years. Direct evidence from 
prescription cost analysis (PCA) data for 15 years and feedback from individual prescribers to support its use 
for longer than 10 years within the UK in the claimed indication was submitted. A survey by Parr et al in 2012 
indicated that GP is prescribed by 70% of all consultant paediatricians with an interest in neurodisability in 
the UK. 
The Applicant’s own survey (Proveca, 2012) provided figures of current and anticipated usage in a sample of 
prescribers in the UK. 37 of 636 (6%) patients with drooling, in the care of those surveyed were prescribed 
GP. The Proveca survey also showed usage in the Netherlands and Ireland. The data from the survey 
conducted by the applicant, while contributing some relevant information, are of limited value due to a small 
sample size and the methodology used.

The fact that GP has been included in prescribing texts, including the British National Formulary for Children, 
for more than 10 years is not considered as evidence of systematic and documented use for at least 10 years 
as it does not document the actual use in the indication applied for. 
The PCA prescription data do not include information on the indication therefore they do not allow 
demonstration of the quantitative use. The unlicensed uses of GP are known to be sialorrhoea, drying of 
respiratory secretions and hyperhidrosis, although the use in hyperhidrosis is topical and is captured 
separately. Hence, the PCA data on the GP use as presented by the Applicant include both sialorrhoea and 
drying of respiratory secretions.  
The surveys conducted by Parr and by the Applicant indicated that the physicians targeted in the surveys 
have prescribed GP for pathological drooling in children for many years, but the actual numbers of 
prescriptions from the PCA database are very low from 1999 to 2006 (less than 200 items dispensed annually 
in England).  
However the applicant was able to show considerably higher prescriptions numbers for drooling or related 
disorders calculated from the UK database Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) giving detailed 
information such as age, diagnoses, medical history and medication history. This database only encompasses 
about 6.9% of UK prescribing. 115 children with a specific diagnosis of drooling and 313 children with 
conditions indicative of drooling could be identified.  
Based on these 428 children identified annual prescriptions of glycopyrronium in children for drooling in the 
UK as ranging from 2388 in year 2006 to 22804 in year 2015 were calculated (community prescribing only; 
no hospital prescribing). 
Although a firm diagnosis of drooling has been established in only 115 children in the CPRD database, it is 
accepted that the detailed medical history available from this database allows establishing with sufficient 
certainty a diagnosis of drooling in additional 313 children.  
These 313 children suffered from neurological disorders, which together with their use of glycopyrronium and 
the absence of other conditions where anticholinergic medicines may be used, make a diagnosis of drooling 
sufficiently likely. Hence, it is supported that 428 children from the CPRD database have been treated with 
glycopyrronium for pathological drooling due to neurological disorders in the period 2006-2015. When taking 
into account the prevalence of the condition, this is considered sufficient to meet the quantitative 
requirements for well-established in the EU. 
Importantly to give assurance that the prescription numbers are representative for UK-wide prescribing and 
not produced by some heavy prescribers, the Applicant could show that none of the physicians participating 
in the CPRD and prescribing glycopyrronium for drooling were prescribing to more than 5 patients.  
Of those practices that prescribed glycopyrronium for drooling, most prescriptions were to single patients. 60 
practices prescribed to 2 patients by practice with a few prescribing to 3 or 4 patients. Rarely practices 
prescribed to 5 patients and none prescribed to more than 5 patients. It has also been shown that the few 
practices prescribing to 5 patients only had a minor impact on the total number of prescriptions.  
When taking into account the prevalence of the condition, the number of prescriptions described in the CPRD 
database is considered sufficient to meet the criterion of the time over which the substance has been used 
and the quantitative aspects of the use of the substance. This could be further substantiated by the applicant, 
who showed that the prescription numbers were representative for UK-wide prescribing and not produced by 
a view heavy prescriber.

- The degree of scientific interest in the use of the substance 
The Applicant provided a comprehensive overview of the literature published from the early 1990s to the 
present day where glycopyrronium is mentioned, discussed or investigated in the context of the proposed 
indication or related uses. Whereas the provided 21 publications over 23 years world-wide have some 
limitations as most of them were non-European, or did not provide detailed information of glycopyrronium 
the Applicant gave proof (through EudraCT numbers and an abstract intended to be presented at the Annual 
Conference of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health) of two clinical studies: a double-blind, 
randomised placebo-controlled study investigating an oral solution of glycopyrronium in children with 
hypersalivation associated with neurodevelopmental disability ongoing in Slovakia and Czech Republic and a 
single-blind study comparing an oral solution of glycopyrronium with a hyoscine cutaneous patch in drooling 
in children with neurodisability performed in the UK.  
Whilst these studies are not yet available in the published literature and do not provide detailed safety and 
efficacy information, they provide valuable information on current clinical development of this active 
substance in the claimed indication. Overall, the submitted references above described are considered 
sufficient evidence of scientific interest in the EU. 
- Coherence of scientific assessments 
The Applicant provided an overview of the publications in which – according to the Applicant – a reference to 
the use of glycopyrronium for the treatment of pathological drooling in children is made. Most of the 
publications address pathological drooling in children with neurological disorders and are consistent in their 
conclusions.  
The references are quite heterogeneous, ranging from brief references in a textbook to reports of randomised 
clinical trials. However, overall, the reports are sufficiently consistent in outlining the effect of glycopyrronium 
in pathological drooling in children, and therefore it is considered that the coherence of the scientific 
assessments has been shown. 
As a conclusion of the assessment of the above criteria, the CHMP is of the view that the applicant provides 
sufficient evidence to establish that the elements related to the quantitative aspects of the use of the 
substance, the time over which the substance has been used, the degree of scientific interest in the use of 
the substance in the EU and the coherence of the scientific assessments are fulfilled. 
- Similarity of the formulations from the literature 
Two main studies contributing to short and long term efficacy and safety (Zeller at al. 2012a and Zeller at al. 
2012b) were performed with a similar formulations and posologies resembling the posology proposed by the 
Applicant. Bioequivalence has not been established between these formulations/preparations but the 
recommended initial dose and dose titration schedule has been revised taking into account the higher 
bioavailability of Sialanar. With the revision of the proposed dose recommendations, it is reasonable to 
conclude that formulations can be considered sufficiently similar to conclude that the results of the Zeller 
studies can be applied to Sialanar. 
- Recognised efficacy and acceptable level of safety 
As clarified in sections 2.5 and 2.6, whilst some efficacy of the substance in the claimed indication is 
recognised despite limitations of the data, the lack of sufficient and reliable qualitative and quantitative data 
and subsequent resulting uncertainties do not allow establishing that glycopyrronium bromide has been used 
in the European Union for the symptomatic treatment of sialorrhoea (chronic pathological drooling) in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 15/143 
  
  
children  and adolescents aged 3 to <18 years with neurological disorders with an acceptable level of safety. 
The application falls therefore short of demonstrating that the requirements of Article 10a of Directive 
2001/83/EC are fulfilled. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as an oral solution containing 400 μg/ml of glycopyrronium bromide 
(equivalent to 320 μg/ml glycopyrronium) as active substance.  
Other ingredients are sodium benzoate (E211), raspberry flavouring (containing propylene glycol E1520), 
sucralose (E955), citric acid (E330) and purified water. 
The product is available in amber coloured glass bottles with a high density polyethylene (HDPE) tamper 
evident child resistant closures and expanded low density polyethylene (LDPE) liners as described in section 
6.5 of the SmPC. Each pack also contains a LDPE oral syringe and syringe adaptor. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of glycopyrronium bromide is (1,1-dimethylpyrrolidin-1-ium-3-yl)-2-cyclopentyl-2-
hydroxy-2-phenylacetate bromide corresponding to the molecular formula C19H28BrNO3 and a relative 
molecular mass of 398.3 g/mol. It has the following structure: 
The active substance is a white to almost white crystalline solid, freely soluble in water and soluble in 
ethanol. The aqueous solubility is sufficiently high to ensure complete dissolution in the commercial 
formulation. 
Glycopyrronium bromide exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of 2 chiral centres. The active 
substance is a racemic mixture of 3S,2R and 3R,2S enantiomers. The diastereomers are controlled in the 
specification according to the Ph. Eur. monograph. 
As there is a monograph of glycopyrronium bromide in the European Pharmacopoeia, the manufacturer of the 
active substance has been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the European Pharmacopoeia (CEP) for the 
active substance which has been provided within the current Marketing Authorisation Application. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The relevant information has been assessed by the EDQM before issuing the Certificate of Suitability. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 16/143 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, solubility, identity, appearance of solution, 
acidity or alkalinity, loss on drying, sulphated ash, impurities and assay in line with the Ph. Eur. monograph. 
Additional tests for related substances and solvents (both GC) are also included in the CEP and have been 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. 
Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay testing has been presented. 
Certificates of analysis for three batches of the active substance are provided. The results are within the 
specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on four production scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in 
the intended commercial package for up to 48 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH), on four 
different batches for up to 36 months under intermediate conditions (30 ºC / 65% RH), and on one batch for 
up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided. 
The following parameters were tested: identity; description; impurities; loss on drying; assay; melting point. 
Testing was conducted in accordance with GMP, using Ph. Eur. methods. No significant changes to any of the 
measured parameters were observed and all parameters remained within specification throughout the 
studies. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. No increase in impurities 
was observed and the assay remained constant, indicating that glycopyrronium bromide is not 
photosensitive. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 12 months without specific storage conditions 
in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is an oral solution aimed at a paediatric population. As such, the formulation 
development is in line with recommendations given by PDCO during PIP assessment. It is a smooth liquid 
with a sweet flavour in order to ensure acceptability in paediatric patients and compliance with the posology. 
The formulation was designed to be simple with no unnecessary excipients. A preservative is required as the 
product is stored in a multi-dose bottle which will be opened frequently over the likely duration of treatment 
(up to 24 weeks). Of the preservatives investigated, sodium benzoate was found to work best and meets the 
requirements of Ph. Eur. 5.1.3 (Efficacy of Microbial Preservation (PET)). The amount added is justified by 
being well below the acceptable daily intake level and effective in stability studies. Citric acid is also added as 
an acidifying agent. 
Glycopyrronium bromide is highly soluble in water but has a bitter taste which is counteracted by inclusion of 
a sweetener and flavouring agent in the formulation. Various formulations were made with different 
sweeteners and flavourings and tested for palatability. Sucralose and raspberry flavour were chosen as the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 17/143 
  
  
 
 
best options, and their levels set at optimum levels. The acceptability of the final formulation was tested 
using an E-tongue and in adult clinical trials. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards or in-house standards (raspberry flavour). There are no novel excipients used in the finished 
product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.2.1 of 
this report. Compatibility of the active substance with the excipients was demonstrated in binary mixtures 
stored at elevated temperature. The formulation used during clinical studies is the same as that intended for 
marketing. 
The finished product was shown to be compatible with a range nasogastric feeding tubes required by some 
patients. It is non-viscous and thus, complete clearance of glycopyrronium bromide can be achieved with a 
single 10 ml water rinse. 
The primary packaging is an amber coloured glass bottle with HDPE tamper evident child resistant closure 
and expanded LDPE liner as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. Each pack also contains a LDPE oral 
syringe and syringe adaptor, for which CE mark certificates have been provided. The materials comply with 
Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data 
and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Originally, the applicant proposed a 5 ml syringe and demonstrated compliance with Ph. Eur. 2.9.27 
(Uniformity of Mass of Delivered Doses from Multidose Containers). At the request of CHMP and in order to 
accommodate the highest 6 ml dose of Sialanar, this was replaced with an 8 ml syringe. The applicant 
committed to demonstrating that the larger syringe complies with Ph. Eur. 2.9.27 by end of June 2016. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of two main steps: dissolution of the active substance and excipients in 
water followed by filling into bottles. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Sufficient details have been provided in terms of manufacturing parameters and in-process controls consist of 
pH checks before and after excipient addition. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality 
in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this simple compounding process. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form consisting of 
tests for appearance, identification (HPLC, UV), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), pH (Ph. Eur.), microbial 
limits (Ph. Eur.), identification and assay of sodium benzoate (HPLC) and fill volume (as IPC). 
Appropriate limits for impurities and pH were introduced during the procedure in response to a major 
objection raised by CHMP. The level of impurity J is below the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3B. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines.  Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities 
testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for two production scale batches and one pilot scale batch confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 18/143 
  
  
 
 
Stability data on two production scale batches and one pilot scale batch of finished product stored for up to 
24 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH), for up to 24 months under intermediate conditions 
(30 ºC / 65% RH), and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the 
ICH guidelines were provided. The stability batches of Sialanar are identical to those proposed for marketing 
and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. A stability study on a third production 
scale batch of Sialanar will be carried out once after the next manufacturing campaign. Samples were 
subjected to the same tests as for release. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. No 
significant trends to any of the measured parameters were observed, other than an increase in one impurity 
which was more marked at higher temperatures. 
Initially, studies demonstrating compatibility with the packaging materials when stored upside down were 
absent. These studies have now been initiated and early results indicate no leachables or increased instability 
which suggests no issue with the container closure system. These studies will be continued and any adverse 
findings reported and addressed post-authorisation. 
In addition, one batch stored in the planned commercial amber bottles or in clear glass bottles was exposed 
to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. The 
results indicate that the finished product is not photosensitive in either format and no storage precautions 
regarding light are required. 
An in-use stability study on one batch of finished product was carried out over a period of four weeks. No 
significant changes to any of the measured parameters were observed and an in-use shelf life of 28 days is 
acceptable. A further in-use stability study on a second batch towards the end of its shelf-life will be carried 
out in line with the guideline on In-Use Stability Testing of Human Medicinal Products in due course. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf life of 24 months and without special storage conditions 
as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
The CHMP recommends the following points for investigation:

• 
• 
The Applicant should repeat the multidose container test on the 8 ml device, testing at 3 dosing 
volumes 0.6 ml (minimum dose), 2.8 ml (mid-point dose) and 6.0 ml (maximum dose). 
The Applicant should conduct an extended in-use study for up to two months on a batch of finished 
product towards the end of its shelf life. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
No new non-clinical studies were submitted for the current application, which presents a summary of 
published literature (17 references) on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology of glycopyrronium 
bromide in animal species. All ingredients to be used in the formulation are stated to be well-known and used 
in currently authorised parenteral and non-parenteral preparations licensed for paediatric use. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Glycopyrronium bromide is a synthetic, nonselective antagonist of peripheral muscarinic cholinergic 
receptors, and therefore has indirect effects on a variety of tissues and organs that are innervated by 
postganglionic cholinergic nerves, as well as smooth muscle that respond to acetylcholine.  
These effects include actions on the cardiovascular system, respiratory tract, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, eyes, 
and glandular tissues, among others. Cholinergic stimulation (i.e., increased “vagal tone”) of cardiac tissue 
typically results in a decrease in cardiac rate (a negative chronotropic effect), a decrease in the rate of 
conduction within the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes (a negative dromotropic effect), and a decrease in 
the force of contraction (a negative inotropic effect).  
According to the cited non-clinical studies on non-clinical pharmacodynamics, the affinity of glycopyrronium 
bromide to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors M1-M5 seems to be varying. Glycopyrronium was shown to 
have high affinity for all five muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor subtypes. Based on studies in 
transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells the affinity of glycopyrronium bromide for human muscarinic 
receptors was determined to be in the order,  4 (pKi = 10.26) > M1/M3 > M5 > M2 (pKi = 9.67) (Casarosa et 
al., 2009).  
In rats, methacholine-induced lacrimal hyper-secretion was antagonised by orally administered 
glycopyrronium. Likewise, glycopyrronium bromide reduced gastric secretion and motility in pyloric-ligated 
(Franko, 1962) and in histamine-stimulated rats with permanent gastric fistulas (Kowalewski, 1970). In 
anaesthetised dogs, intravenous or oral doses of glycopyrronium markedly reduced intestinal tone and 
moderately inhibited amplitude of intestinal contractions (Franko, 1062). In a more recent study in dogs, low 
intramuscular doses of glycopyrronium completely inhibited gastric motility for at least 30 minutes, whereas 
higher doses caused a cessation of activity for more than 3 hours (Burger, 2006). A reduced volume of 
methacholine-induced salivary secretion was demonstrated in dogs following an i.v. dose of glycopyrronium 
(Franko, 1962).  
In a study by Posey et al. (1970), glycopyrronium (glycopyrrolate, 2 mg) given orally 4 times daily to dogs, 
induced ultrastructural parietal cell alterations and profound cytoplasmic vacuolization. The mitochondrial 
alterations are by the Applicant assumed to be related to drug-induced enzymatic effects. As similar changes 
were observed with atropine sulphate and propantheline bromide, a general anticholinergic effect may 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 20/143 
  
  
explain the findings. The Applicant argues that no clinical relevance of this effect is expected, as acid-
secreting parietal cells undergo continuous renewal and because treatment of patients with duodenal ulcers 
with GP for one year did not reduce parietal cell mass (Kaye, 1969). As no clinical concerns regarding this 
effect have been presented, the conclusion by the Applicant is considered plausible. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Secondary pharmacodynamics effects of glycopyrrolate were observed as local anaesthetic properties when 
injected intradermally to guinea pigs or applied topically to the cornea of rabbits (Franko, 1962). 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Glycopyrronium bromide was not evaluated in the standard battery of safety pharmacology studies. The only 
non-clinical studies cited are very old (from 1962 and 1978; Franko et al., and Proakis et al., respectively) 
and both publications give very limited experimental detail, as also pointed out by the Applicant. In one early 
study, there were no effects on heart rate or carotid arterial pressure in anaesthetised dogs, and no effects 
on ventilation were reported (Franko, 1962). The penetrance of glycopyrronium bromide across the blood 
brain barrier was variable, although seemed minimal, in dogs, cats and mice. In dogs, the response in blood 
pressure to glycopyrronium was also variable between studies. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No non-clinical studies were performed or cited regarding pharmacodynamic drug interactions for 
glycopyrronium bromide this was considered acceptable by the CHMP.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No new pharmacokinetic studies were performed for this application and two publications from 1973 and 
1978 were cited. One publication concerns absorption, distribution and metabolism of 14C-labelled 
glycopyrrolate in the mouse (Kagiwada, 1973), and the other (Proakis 1978) describes the penetration of 
glycopyrrolate and atropine across the blood-brain and placental barriers in dogs.  
The Applicant has provided brief descriptions of the absorption and distribution of glycopyrronium bromide. 
Following oral administration of 4.83 μCi/mouse, small amounts of radioactivity were present in the blood by 
0.5 hours and remained detectable for up to 6 hours at concentrations of 1.1-1.6 μμCi/mg. Absorption was 
poor due to the highly ionised and water soluble nature of the drug; 1.9% of the dose was found in the 
stomach and 6.4% in the small intestine at 3 h post-dose (Kagiwada, 1973). Following i.v. dosing of 0.966 
μCi/mouse, the peak of radioactivity was seen at 5-10 min after administration (Kagiwada, 1973).  
Following oral and i.v. administration of radiolabelled glycopyrronium to mice, total radiolabelled components 
were rapidly distributed throughout the body. High levels of radioactivity were observed in highly perfused 
tissues (kidney, liver, small intestine and various glands) but not in the brain. Autoradiogram did not reveal 
any radioactivity in the foetus following administration to pregnant animals (Kagiwada, 1973). 
After multiple oral administration of radiolabelled glycopyrronium at 3.86 μCi/mouse/day over 1 week, the 
radioactivity disappeared entirely from organs at 72 hours after the last dose, and accumulation was not 
observed (Kagiwada, 1973). 
The metabolites of glycopyrronium, 1,1-dimethyl-3-hydroxypyrrolidinium bromide α-(2- or 3-
hydroxycyclopentyl) mandelate (M1),  1, 1-dimethyl-3-hydroxypyrrolidinium bromide benzoyl formate (M2) 
and 1,1-dimethyl-3-hydroxypyrrolidinium bromide (M5), were detected mainly in the liver and kidney 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 21/143 
  
  
(Kagiwada, 1973). After oral dosing, M2 was the most prevalent metabolite in urine, followed by M1, and 
glycopyrronium was not detected. Similar concentrations of M1 and M2 were found in the liver and kidney. 
Entero-hepatic circulation is presumed to account for these findings. 
Excretion of an orally administered dose was about 7.6% in urine, about 78.9% in faeces and no drug was 
detected in expired air (Kagiwada, 1973). 
Regarding the paper by Proakis, 1978, the Applicant states in the Pharmacokinetics Written Summary that: 
‘This study shows that glycopyrronium is a selective peripheral anticholinergic agent and thus resistant to 
penetration across the BB and placental barriers.’ However, this could be misinterpreted to indicate that 
glycopyrronium bromide does not at all penetrate the blood-brain barrier, which is not considered to be in 
accordance with the contents and results described in the article. Taking into account that Sialanar is 
indicated for chronic use in the paediatric population, and as it is known that contagious disease may 
enhance the passage across lipid membranes such as the blood-brain barrier, the Applicant was asked to 
address possible safety issues (e.g. neurodevelopmental consequences or toxicity) related to the ability of 
glycopyrronium bromide to cross the blood-brain barrier, even if in minimal amounts in the proposed 
population. According to the Applicant, CNS effects occur at a low rate and will be included in any clinical 
decision on dose adjustments. The Applicant therefore considers that in view of the clinical experience at 
hand no additional nonclinical investigation of such effects is warranted.  
The use of only two (old) publications seems to greatly limit the translation of non-clinical data into the 
clinical use of glycopyrronium bromide. However, the pharmacokinetics of GP have been thoroughly 
discussed in clinical sections and the need for additional nonclinical studies on this subject, is not considered 
necessary.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
No new toxicology studies were performed in support of the Sialanar application. According to the Applicant, 
only very few published articles are available on the toxicology of glycopyrronium, and these date from 1962, 
1970 and 1998.  
Table 1 Summary of presented toxicology studies and publications.

Single dose toxicity 
Sparse data are reported in the literature for glycopyrronium bromide following single oral, intraperitoneal 
(i.p.) or intravenous (i.v.) administration to mice, rats, rabbits, cats and dogs. 
Table 2 Franko, 1962, 1970 
Signs of acute toxicity were found to be similar in all species (mouse, rat, rabbit, dog and cat) regardless the 
route of dosing. These included mydriasis (all species), tremors, decreased motor activity, clonic and tonic 
convulsions, respiration failure and death. In rats and mice, absorption of a lethal quantity was not readily 
accomplished via the oral route. The LD50 values for all species after i.v. dosing was found to be in the range 
15-30 mg/kg.  
Repeat dose toxicity 
The Applicant only refers to one chronic, oral repeat dose toxicity study in dogs (Dollery, 1998). The 
applicant summarizes that in repeated dose toxicity studies in mice, rats, and dogs with oral drug 
administration or drug administration by inhalation, an exaggerated pharmacodynamic activity of 
glycopyrronium was observed at high dose levels but no other toxic effects were reported. No risk of adverse 
effects is expected at the intended therapeutic dose levels in patients.  
Genotoxicity 
No genotoxicity studies were performed and according to the Applicant, no data are available in the public 
domain. Please refer to non-clinical discussion. 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were performed. According to the Applicant, no data are available in the public 
domain. Please refer to non-clinical discussion. The lack of carcinogenicity data is of concern as it does not 
allow to sufficiently characterize the safety profile. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Only one published study from 1970 (Franko) was cited in the section Reproductive and Developmental 
Toxicity.

Groups of 20 male and 20 female rats were divided into groups of 5 and given glycopyrronium in the diet at 
doses of 0, 32.5, 63 or 130 ppm for 3-5 weeks. They were then mated. An additional mating used control 
females that had borne 3 normal litters and treated males that had sired no litters in previous matings; the 
males were on control diet for 3 weeks prior to the mating. Litters were examined for abnormalities, although 
it is not stated what these examinations included and there are no data for skeletal or visceral abnormalities.  
A summary of reproductive performance in rats given glycopyrronium shows a decrease in the rate of 
conception and in survival rate at weaning (Table below). Examination of offspring revealed no abnormalities 
attributable to drug administration.

Toxicokinetic data 
No toxicokinetic data was submitted. Please refer to non-clinical discussion. The lack of toxicokinetic data is 
of concern as it does not allow to sufficiently characterize the safety profile. 
Local Tolerance  
Glycopyrronium bromide is intended for oral application. There are no tolerance studies on the mucosa but 
glycopyrronium applied topically to the skin of female rabbits at doses of 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5 or 25 mg/ml saline, 
0.2 or 2 mg/ml water, or 200, 632 or 2000 ppm in water produced slight erythema of about 24 h duration 
with the lowest dose, and higher doses caused slight oedema and more persistent erythema (Franko, 1970). 
Only minimal signs of toxicity even though systemic absorption occurred as indicated by eye changes 
(Franko, 1970). As in a paediatric clinical trial (Zeller, 2012) no reports of mucosal irritation were reported 
these findings were considered without clinical relevance. 
Other toxicity studies 
No non-clinical literature describing the toxicity of glycopyrronium bromide in juvenile animals was presented. 
Possible toxic effects related to chronic oral administration of glycopyrronium on developing organs, such as

the CNS, neuroendocrine-, immune- and reproductive systems were addressed by the Applicant with 
reference to clinical data. Insufficient data in the public domain makes it difficult to adequately assess effects 
on the reproductive system in young adults.  
The excipients in the proposed formulation are stated to be well-known and used currently in authorised 
paediatric oral formulations. The raspberry flavour 1 mg/ml contains 97% of propylene glycol. The WHO has 
set a maximum permissible daily intake of propylene glycol as a food additive to 25 mg/ kg/day. 
Nevertheless, clinical data showed that in children from the age of 5 years and adult patients, up to 500 
mg/kg/day of propylene glycol could generally be considered safe. In the absence of compelling data this 
safety threshold was decreased to 50 mg/kg/day in children less than 5 years old as indicated in in CHMP 
assessment on propylene glycol (EMA/175205/2014). The exposure in this product is equivalent to 0.865 
mg/kg/day as defined by the applicant; this is well below the set limits. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
According to the ERA report provided by the applicant, the projected use of Sialanar would result in 
maximum predicted environmental concentrations in receiving waters three orders of magnitude lower than 
the 0.01 μg.L-1 action level. The PECsw value, using the Fpen value of 0.101% is conservatively calculated to 
be 0.00364 μg.L-1 based on a prevalence of chronic pathological drooling of 0.6% in the sub-population of 3-
18 year olds (~16.8% of total European population), and therefore is several orders of magnitude below any 
predicted no-effect values (derived from QSAR values).

The CHMP recommends the following points for further investigation:  
According to the Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use 
(EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010 Rev. 1), ‘Log Kow should be determined experimentally. A calculated Log K ow 
value is generally not acceptable’ and ‘QSARs and read-across cannot replace the studies asked for in the 
guideline on the ERA of medicinal products for human use. The Applicant may perform a study to determine 
LogKow experimentally after marketing authorisation and to submit the results.  
If indeed the LogKow remains below 4.5 in the future experimental study no further assessment of potential 
environmental risk is required for this proposed prescribed use of glycopyrronium bromide. If logKow >4.5, 
further risk assessment will be necessary and may be performed. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The Applicant has presented a non-clinical dossier for glycopyrronium bromide, which is based on 
bibliographical data, in line with the requirements under Article 10a of Directive 2001/83/EC. The non-clinical 
references comprise 17 references, in addition to several clinical publications. The multitude of non-clinical 
publications date back from the 1960s and 1970s.  
The pharmacodynamic properties of glycopyrronium bromide are generally well-known. The cited articles 
summarize the muscarinic receptors found in salivary glands, pharmacodynamic effects of glycopyrronium 
bromide as a nonselective antagonist of peripheral muscarinic cholinergic receptors as well as specific 
pharmaco-chemistry properties involving quaternary ammonium structure.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 26/143 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Provided references were focused on gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system effects and no 
sufficient references were provided to support the salivary inhibition effect after oral administration. 
However, pharmacodynamic effects of glycopyrronium bromide as a nonselective antagonist of peripheral 
muscarinic cholinergic receptors as well as specific pharmaco-chemistry properties involving quaternary 
ammonium structure are well known and deemed as sufficient to support the proof of concept of the intended 
indication. 
The safety pharmacology studies cited are old (1960s), give little experimental detail, and are not considered 
to be in line with current guidelines and GLP.  
The known cardiovascular safety issues of glycopyrronium bromide in the clinical setting may explain the lack 
of new non-clinical safety pharmacology studies of cardiovascular effects. Cardiovascular safety is addressed 
in appropriate sections of the clinical safety assessment.  
The described pharmacokinetic properties of glycopyrronium bromide in non-clinical species is very limited 
but the lack of new pharmacokinetic studies for this application is considered acceptable as clinical data 
supersede non-clinical data.  
The penetrance of glycopyrronium bromide across the blood brain barrier was variable, although seemed 
minimal, in dogs, cats and mice. In dogs, the response in blood pressure to glycopyrronium was also variable 
between studies. As a consequence of its quaternary charge glycopyrronium has limited ability to penetrate 
the blood brain barrier. The potential safety concerns regarding passage of GP over the blood-brain barrier in 
children with neurological disorders, is of concern as in the Mier, 2000 article, 23% treated with GP vs. 3% 
treated with placebo had behavioural changes this is further addressed in the safety sections and clinical 
concerns on neurodevelopment remain. 
The only publication on repeat-dose toxicity (Dollery, 1998) presents only subtle experimental detail and 
does not meet the regulatory expectations of at least 6-month data (oral administration) in a rodent and 9-
month data in a non-rodent species and is not considered sufficient for bridging to the chronic dosing 
regimen of glycopyrronium bromide in children proposed for this application. Extrapolation of safety margins 
to the paediatric population is not possible, as no exposure data are available from repeated dose toxicology 
studies and no studies in juvenile animals have been performed with glycopyrronium bromide. In the absence 
of robust bibliographic data to the chronic oral dosing in the paediatric population is not supported. 
The Applicant refers to non-clinical genotoxicity or carcinogenicity studies from public assessment reports. 
The applicant summarizes that the genotoxicity studies did not reveal any mutagenic or clastogenic potential 
for glycopyrronium bromide and the carcinogenicity studies in transgenic mice using oral administration and 
in rats using inhalation administration revealed no evidence of carcinogenicity. However, reference to public 
assessment reports do not fulfil the requirements of annex I of Directive 20001/83/EC and do not substitute 
the need to provide data. Clinical Safety data from published controlled trials or other publications are 
insufficient. Adequate justification for the lack of such data has not been presented. In addition, the dossier 
lacks a proper justification for the missing toxicokinetic data to allow extrapolation of safety margins in the 
intended population, including children > 3 years.  
Only one study from 1970 (Franko, 1970) was cited in the section Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity. 
No experimental detail is available. It is stated, however, that glycopyrronium was administered in the diet. 
As no blood samples appear to have been drawn, the actual exposure of the animals to glycopyrronium may 
have been limited. Taking into account the significant food interaction seen with glycopyrronium in the clinical 
setting, the actual bioavailability and exposure of the animals to glycopyrronium in this study is questionable.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 27/143 
  
  
The Applicant considers that clinical use of glycopyrronium in children negates the need for further non-
clinical data regarding repeat-use toxicology, reproductive/developmental toxicology, genotoxicity and 
carcinogenicity data. This view is not supported. Published and assessable data of sufficient quality regarding 
genotoxicity, carcinogenesis and reproductive and developmental toxicity are still considered necessary in 
order to complete the non-clinical part of this submission. In view of the chronic use of this substance and 
the characteristics of the target population, these data cannot be substituted by clinical safety results gained 
with glycopyrronium bromide during short-term use, in other indications or in adults.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Without robust clinical safety data, the lack of published data regarding repeat-dose toxicology, 
reproductive/developmental toxicology, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity data does not allow to address 
uncertainties related to the safety profile of this substance. Extrapolation of safety margins to the proposed 
target population are not considered adequate due to lack of toxicokinetic exposure data.  
Based on the provided non-clinical dossier, the application for glycopyrronium bromide for treatment of 
sialorrhoea in children aged 3-18 years, is considered non-approvable at the present based on the submitted 
data. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
According to Article 10a of Directive 2001/83/EC, if the Applicant can demonstrate that the active substance 
of the medicinal product has been in well-established medicinal use within the EU for at least 10 years, with 
recognised efficacy and an acceptable level of safety in terms of the conditions set out in Annex I of the 
abovementioned Directive, it is possible to replace results of pre-clinical and clinical trials by detailed 
references to appropriate  scientific literature.  
In support of this PUMA application, the Applicant relies in particular on three published Phase III clinical 
trials, Zeller, 2012a, Zeller, 2012b and one with crushed and gelatin encapsulated tablets to allow for placebo 
comparison (Mier, 2000) which are claimed to demonstrate the clinical efficacy and safety of GP for the 
treatment of sialorrhoea in the paediatric population with neurological disorders. The medicinal product used 
in Zeller studies is a GBOS presentation of lower concentration (1 mg/5 mL or 0.2 mg/mL) than the 
Applicant’s presentation (0.4 mg/mL), and was approved for the indication ‘reduce chronic severe drooling in 
patients aged 3-16 years with neurological conditions associated with problem drooling (e.g. cerebral palsy)’ 
by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US in 2010 (Cuvposa PI, 2013).  
In total clinical data are available from five completed studies in the paediatric population that inform the 
efficacy profile of GP when used for the proposed indication: 
a) 
b) 
Two pivotal studies in the paediatric population (Zeller, 2012a; Mier, 2000); 
Three supportive studies in the paediatric population (Zeller, 2012b; Blasco, 1996; Stern, 1997) 
A further supportive study (Arbouw, 2010) was submitted which examined the efficacy of GP for the 
treatment of sialorrhoea in adults with Parkinson’s disease (PD). 
Furthermore the data on an open label, single dose, two way crossover study to compare the bioavailability 
of 2 mg glycopyrronium bromide from Sialanar (2 mg/5 ml) (test product) with that of 2 mg glycopyrronium 
Assessment report

Page 28/143 
  
  
bromide from the product used in Zeller studies (1 mg/5 ml solution) in healthy adults (study PRO/GLY/001) 
were submitted in order to bridge to Zeller studies. 
Hence, apart from the PK/PD information retrieved from study PRO/GLY/001 for the purpose of bridging to 
the data in the literature, the clinical pharmacology data were derived from the literature. 
GCP 
This MAA contains two main clinical studies (Zeller 2012a and Mier 2000) submitted as published literature. 
The Zeller 2012a study was reportedly conducted in accordance with GCP. There is no statement about GCP 
compliance for the latter study. There are no statements about any GCP inspection.

general 
surgery 
The information on the PK of GP in children was derived from studies reported in literature, all single dose 
studies with either i.v. or oral administration of GP in patients undergoing surgery. In adults, the literature 
studies (all single dose, i.v., i.m. or oral administration) were supplemented by the 
bioequivalence/bioavailability single dose study (PRO/GLY/001) in healthy volunteers, where GBOS (test 
product) and the product used in the Zeller studies (hereinafter ‘reference product’) were compared in terms 
of Cmax and AUC0-t. 
The oral bioavailability of GP is very low and variable. The oral bioavailability in children was estimated at 
3.3% following a single dose of 50 µg/kg (range 1.3-13.3, Rautakorpi 1998). Based on data from the Robinul 
prescribing information, the Applicant suggests a BA of GBOS of 5.8%, which is less than the BA reported in 
the literature of 10-25% of GP.  
Absorption  
The bioavailability of the GBOS formulation compared to the reference product formulation was investigated 
in a bioequivalence study. Conventional 80-125% criteria for bioequivalence were employed. Bioequivalence 
could not be demonstrated as the confidence interval for the ratio (test vs. reference) for both Cmax and 
AUC0-t exceeded 1. A 25% higher exposure and a 22% higher Cmax with GBOS were observed. 
Furthermore, PK variability was large when considering the rather narrow therapeutic interval of GP. 
No food interaction studies were conducted with GBOS, and the BE/BA study PRO/GLY/001 was performed in 
fasting subjects. The Applicant did not refer to any literature in order to address the influence of food on the 
bioavailability of GBOS. In the product information for the reference product, the drug is recommended to be 
taken before or after meals, as food reduces the absorption of the drug.  
Distribution 
The volume of distribution (Vd) was evaluated in children and adults in two studies (Rautakorpi, 1998 and 
Ali-Melkkilä, 1989), and corresponds that of total body water. The Vd was higher in children (1.3-1.8 L/kg) 
compared with 0.64 L/kg in adults, corresponding well the larger total body water volumen in children. 
Distribution to the CNS was shown in 4/9 children with hydrocephalus, undergoing shunt operations, with the 
highest concentration in two patients with a shunt infection however no GP in CSF in adult patients 
undergoing vaginal hysterectomy was found.  
Elimination 
The predominant route of elimination of glycopyrronium bromide (GP) is by renal excretion; approximately 
65% of an i.v. dose is renally excreted within the first 8-24 hours (Kirvelä, 1993 [m2.7.2, Table 20]; Ali-
Melkkilä, 1990a; Ali-Melkkilä, 1990b, and approximately 85% after 48 hours (Kaltiala, 1974). A much smaller 
proportion (~5%) is eliminated in the bile (Kaltiala, 1974). 
Two studies in children reported clearance following an i.v. dose of 5 µg/kg in children 0-14 years of age. In 
children aged < 1 year and 1-3 years, respectively, clearance ranged from 1.01 L/h/kg to 1.41 L/h/kg. In 
children aged 7-14 years, clearance was estimated to 1.09 L/h/kg. Elimination half-life varied from 46.7 min 
to 139 min. No half-life values following oral administration in children were reported. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 31/143 
  
  
 
Table 8 PK parameters following single dose i.v. GP (5 µg/kg) in children 7-14 years of age 
In adults, the elimination half-life has been shown to be dependent of the route of administration 
(Ali-Melkkilä, 1989), with the shortest half-life following i.v. administration of 0.83 ± 0.27 hrs (~50 min). 
Elimination half-life following i.m. administration was 75 minutes and following oral administration 2.5-3 
hours, with highly variable results.  
Studies have found that 50-80% of GP is excreted as unchanged drug, in the urine (primarily) and bile 
(Kaltiala, 1974; Ali Melkkilä, 1990a). The renal elimination of GP involves both glomerular filtration and 
proximal tubular secretion. Most of GP is eliminated unchanged, and it appears that only a small part of GP is 
metabolised.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
No formal evaluations of the dose proportionality and time dependency of the PK were performed as only 
single dose studies with one dose level only were done. This pertains to both children and adults. An indirect 
comparison of the Cmax in two studies, Ali Melkkilä, 1989 and PRO/GLY/001 was provided, showing a 
doubling of the Cmax value in adult patients treated with 2 and 4 mg: 0.332 µg/ml and 0.76 ± 0.35 µg/L.  
In children, the inter-individual variability of Cmax (median 0.37 µg/L, ranges 0.19-0.44) after oral 
administration of 50 µg/kg appeared to be less than both AUC0-t (median 106.6 µg.min/L, ranges 38.5-
278.7), and Tmax (median 90, ranges 30-480). Also, in comparison with the adults, less variability in Cmax 
is suggested. No data on intra-individual variability was presented for children.  
In adults, following stage 1 of study PRO/GLY/001, the intra-individual variability of GBOS was estimated in 
order to calculate the sample size for stage 2. Stage 1 showed an intra-individual variability of 37.5% for 
Cmax and 31.1% for AUC0-t. A quite large inter-individual CV% was seen as regards Cmax and AUC0-t, 
largest for the reference product, where the Cmax CV% was 95%, and the AUC0-t CV% was 82%. The 
corresponding CV% for GBOS were smaller with 62% for both Cmax and AUC0-t.  
Special populations 
For special populations, only single dose studies were submitted for the presentation of GP PK, hence no 
information as regards the steady state PK in special populations is provided. This means that the PK in 
children, adults and renal disease patients has been evaluated after single doses of GP only. PK effects of the 
covariates weight, race, and gender were not characterised.  
The PK across age ranges of 0.2-14 years, after i.v. administration of 5 µg/kg, did differ for the children aged 
1.3 years. However, the PK parameters were highly variable, and it is suggested that the PK parameters are 
comparable for all ages.

The PK of GP was evaluated in 11 uraemic patients undergoing renal transplantation with a mean serum 
creatinine concentration of 731 ± 267 µmol/L (SD), compared with 7 patients without renal impairment (s-
crea 75 ± 17 µmol/L), ASA1, undergoing general surgery, (Kirvelä et al, 1993). The elimination was 
significantly prolonged in the renally impaired patients, with twice the elimination half-life, a three times 
higher AUC, and a three times lower clearance, as compared to subjects with normal creatinine.  
In summary the impact of renal impairment was significant after single doses, with increased exposure and 
prolonged half-life, and it is expected that with multiple dosing, similar effects will be seen.  
Given the minor importance of hepatic metabolism in the elimination of glycopyrronium, it is agreed that a 
study in patients with hepatic impairment is not warranted since the impact of reduced metabolising capacity 
is likely minimal. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No dedicated drug-drug interaction studies were performed by the Applicant. It is stated by the Applicant that 
in study PRO/GLY/001, no drug/drug interactions were observed during the study. Concomitant medication 
was oral contraceptives in 11/27 female study participants, other medications were acetaminophen and 
ophthalmic preparations taken 12 hours post dose. Hence, the drugs taken are not supposed to interfere with 
PK assessment. The Applicant has conducted a review of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions 
relevant for glycopyrronium or for anticholinergic medicines in general based on the website Drugs.com and 
additional publications where relevant. The site contains a library of reference information which includes 
content from Cerner Multum, Micromedex from Truven Health Analytics, Wolters Kluwer Health, U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA), Physicians' Desk Reference, A.D.A.M., Stedmans, AHFS, Harvard Health 
Publications, North American Compendiums, PharmaLive, & Healthday. Drugs.com is certified by the TRUSTe 
online privacy certification program and the HONcode, Health on the Net Foundation (see also safety 
assessment).  
Most of the listed interactions are not specific to glyopyrronium, but apply to anticholinergic medicines in 
general. The information has been extracted from a number of well-recognized sources and conclusions in 
terms of recommendations (contraindications, cautions as well as more specific recommendations in the 
SmPC) for each medicine/class of medicines is generally supported. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
No pharmacokinetic studies using human biomaterials were submitted. This was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Anti-muscarinic drugs are competitive inhibitors of the actions of acetylcholine at the muscarinic receptors of 
autonomic effector sites innervated by parasympathetic (cholinergic postganglionic) nerves, as well as being 
inhibitors of the action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle lacking cholinergic innervation. GP inhibits the 
pharmacological action of acetylcholine, hence, an anti-cholinergic effect is achieved. The effect of GP in 
drooling is judged by the clinical response, and no biomarkers are available. The antisialogoque effect was 
only assessed in adults, heart rate in both children and adults. 
The mechanism of action of GP is well-known, and the anti-cholinergic effect, hyposalivation, is the desired 
effect for the sought indication drooling. Hence, the scientific rationale is understood and accepted.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Effect of GP on heart rate 
Vagolytic effects has been shown to occur at a plasma GP concentration of 10 µg/L. Only one study reported 
Cmax of more than 10 µg/L: In adults undergoing vaginal hysterectomy a Cmax of 15.79 µg/L was seen 
following 8 µg/kg i.m. Heart rate increased within ½ hour by app. 20 beats/min, which resolved in 1-3 hours. 
No other submitted studies reported Cmax values above 10 µg/L following oral administration. 
In the studies by Rautakorpi in children, no effect on the heart rate or blood pressure after an i.v. dose of 5 
µg/kg or an oral dose of 50 µg/kg was observed in children aged ½-14 years undergoing minor surgery. 
In the studies by Mirakhur in children, the PD of GP administered i.v. or i.m. at different dose-levels for the 
prevention of the oculo-cardiac reflex effect during squint surgery or elective ophthalmic surgery was 
evaluated. Oculo-cardiac reflex was defined as a decrease in heart rate of ≥ 20%, or the occurrence of 
arrhythmia during traction of the eye muscles, irrespective of baseline heart rate. No oral administration of 
GP was assessed in these studies. A significant increase in heart rate from baseline was observed following 
i.m. administration in children undergoing elective ophthalmic surgery. Even though the absolute increase in 
heart rate from baseline was higher for the 7.5 µg/kg dose compared with the 5 µg/kg dose (3-7 heart 
beats), large SDs preclude any conclusions on a dose-response relationship. The ocular-cardiac reflex 
(decrease in heart rate of ≥ 20%) was inhibited in GP treated patients undergoing squint surgery to a larger 
extent as compared with those receiving placebo. 
In the study by Mirakur et al, 1982c dysrhythmias were infrequent in conscious patients at either (5 or 
7.5 µg/kg) dose of i.v. GP (5-10% of patients), but were somewhat higher in anaesthetized patients (25%) 
after 5 µg/kg. Accelerated junctional rhythm was the main dysrhythmia observed. Dysrhythmia was 
considerably less frequent in patients who received 7.5 µg/kg GP i.v. compared with patients who received 
placebo. 
Parenteral administration of GP resulted in heart rate increases, but whether these increases are clinically 
relevant from a safety perspective has not been discussed, only is it stated by the Applicant that no 
significant increases in heart rate were observed after i.v. and oral administration, respectively.  
In adults, the effect of GP on heart rate was assessed in the literature only, showing that following oral 
administration, at three different dose levels (2, 4, and 8 mg) in healthy volunteers, no heart rate increases 
were observed, hence no dose-response relationship were noticed (Mirakhur, 1978a). Following parenteral 
administration, in patients undergoing minor surgery/ECT (Mirakhur, 1979a), significant increases in heart 
rate were observed, with increasing doses. Heart rate was measured by either palpation or ECG. The heart 
rate increases usually resolved within 1-3 hours.  
Anti-sialogogue effects of GP 
Ali-Melkkilä, 1989, showed that following an oral dose of 4 mg, just prior to induction of anaesthesia, a 
significant anti-sialogogue effect was significant after 6 hours only, i.e. a very slow-onset of the PD effect, in 
these 6 patients undergoing ocular surgery. The effect was followed until 8 hours post-administration.  
In a study by and Mirakhur, 1978a, 6 healthy volunteers, received 3 doses of GP, administered either i.v, i.m 
or orally, i.e. every subject received 9 doses of GP. The results indicated a dose-dependent reduction in 
salivary secretion, measured by using citric acid placed under the tongue and secretions collected in a jar, 
although with a slower onset after oral administration. The study ended after 6 hours. The assessment of 
salivary function was different from study to study. Some used evaluation by a VAS 0-10 scale (mouth 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 34/143 
  
  
normal – extremely dry), and others had the effect of GP on salivary secretion in patients undergoing surgery 
evaluated by the anaesthetist, categorizing the mouth as dry, moderately dry or wet. Hence, the methods by 
which the anti-sialoqoque effect was evaluated differed among the studies submitted.  
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
As stated previously, no dedicated drug-drug interaction studies were performed by the Applicant. However, 
the Applicant has conducted a thorough review of pharmacokinetic interactions relevant for glycopyrronium 
or for anticholinergic medicines in general. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology characteristics of Sialanar are based on bibliographical data in line with the 
requirements under Article 10a of Directive 2001/83/EC. A full study report has been submitted for the 
bioequivalence/bioavailability study (PRO/GLY/001) comparing the bioavailability of the to-be-marketed 
GBOS formulation (Sialanar) with the formulation of the product used in the Zeller studies (the reference 
product), marketed in the US. The study was intended to bridge with the published literature for the pivotal 
studies.  
Study PRO/GLY/001 showed a large difference in the bioavailability of the two products. In the context of an 
active substance with complex gastrointestinal absorption in particular the excipient sorbitol (known to 
reduce absorption) in the reference product, may explain the difference in bioavailability between the two 
formulations. 
Due to the higher bioavailability of Sialanar (approximately 20% higher exposure) compared to the reference 
product the recommended initial dose and dose titration schedule was revised to a 20% lower initial dose and 
20% lower dose increments.  
After amending the titration schedule bridging to the most recently generated efficacy and safety data on the 
target population via the target route of administration (Zeller studies) is acceptable. Also all of the GP 
efficacy and safety data in the target population had been generated using oral formulations (Zeller, 2012 a 
and b, Mier, 2000, Blasco 1996, Stern 1997, and Bachrach 1998) and can therefore be taken into account. 
The i.v. and i.m. data has been used to support particular pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and safety 
discussions related to the drug substance per se and can be considered relevant for this purpose. 
Even though during titration efficacy will be balanced against tolerability both products show a high PK 
variability and pronounced food interaction and the responses may differs from day to day, and even from 
dose to dose. Also one of the referenced studies by Rautakorpi, 1998, concluded high variability and low 
bioavailability of glycopyrronium administered i.v. or orally, which is in line with the results of study 
PRO/GLY/001. 
Considering the revised titration schedule and the recommendation to administer Sialanar without food (as is 
the case of the reference product), the potential detrimental effects of the high pharmacokinetic variability 
with Sialanar on safety and tolerability (excursions in exposure leading to adverse effects) are considered to 
be reflected by the by the safety and tolerability data obtained with reference product. 
Data from a food interaction study showed that the absorption of a GP product (10 ml, 1 mg/ 5 ml) oral 
solution is reduced when administered with food. Cmax was 74% lower under fed conditions and AUC0-t was 
reduced by 78%. No food-drug interaction studies were conducted with Sialanar, and study PRO/GLY/001 
was performed in fasting subjects.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 35/143 
  
  
To address potential food effects on the bioavailability of Sialanar the applicant justified that the likely 
direction of the food effect will be the same as for the product used in the Zeller studies, i.e. a marked 
reduction of exposure – although it may be quantitatively different. The recommendation to dose without 
food is consistent with the label of the product used in the Zeller studies and likely leads to less PK variability 
compared to having no recommendations or a recommendation to take with food. It is also considered to 
reflect best the clinical data obtained with the formulation used in the Zeller studies. 
The impact of renal impairment was significant after single doses, with increased exposure and prolonged 
half-life, and it is expected that with multiple dosing, similar effects will be seen. Based on extrapolation of 
results from adult subjects with mild to moderate renal impairment, the Applicant proposed a dose reduction 
of 30% in children with mild or moderate renal impairment. Since Sialanar will be titrated based on an 
assessment of efficacy and side effects, the proposal was endorsed by the CHMP and included in the SmPC. 
Given the very limited data, also a warning regarding mild and moderate renal impairment in the SmPC was 
added. As GP elimination of GP is largely renal and impaired in patients with severe renal impairment, 
irrespective of the cause the applicant proposed a contraindication for these patients to which the CHMP 
agreed.  
The Applicant provided a thorough review of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug-drug interactions 
relevant for glycopyrronium or for anticholinergic medicines in general. Recommendations on drug-drug 
interactions (contraindications, cautions as well as more specific recommendations) for each medicine/class 
of medicines are supported by the CHMP and relevant information has been included into the SmPC. 
The Applicant addressed the correlation between GP exposure and adverse events analysing the relative 
bioavailability study, PRO/GLY/001, for a possible relationship between exposure and frequency of any AE, 
total number of AEs per subject, frequency of the most common adverse events (headache, dry mouth, and 
dry throat) and severe adverse events. No firm conclusions can be made on a relationship, although the 
performed analysis suggested a small trend between the overall exposure and the frequency of AE 
occurrence and the frequency of dry throat. Further reference was made to the study by Zeller et al, 2012b 
which reported the relationship between the frequency of AEs and administered glycopyrronium doses. A 
clear relationship with dose (or dose range) was seen for a number of adverse events. 
The presented pharmacodynamic studies confirm the expected effects on heart rate (increase) as well as 
anti-sialogogue effects of GP. The Applicant has provided a comprehensive overview of the published 
literature on effects on heart rate induced glycopyrronium (both in adults and in children) as well as limited 
data from its own relative bioavailability study, PRO/GLY/001.  
The applicant presented simulated data suggesting that the plasma concentrations using Sialanar will be 
somewhere in between what was observed in Rautakorpi, 1998 study using glycopyrrolate orally and 
intravenously in which no significant increase in heart rate was observed. However this information was 
considered insufficient by the CHMP.  
Only 6 otherwise healthy children in the age 7-14 years were included who underwent surgery, and 
glycopyrrolate was administered together with anesthesia. It is not mentioned what was used to induce 
anesthesia, but most likely this could have had an effect on pulse rate. Additionally, the heart rate (median) 
did increase from approximately 80 at baseline to a maximum of approximately 95 after an intravenous 
infusion. The same change was not seen after the oral administration but only one oral dose was 
administered. The plasma concentrations and possible effects on heart rate are expected to be higher at 
steady state (after approximately 5 doses).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 36/143 
  
  
Data from the Rautakorpi 1994 article where 11 otherwise heathy children (aged 3-12 years) who were given 
an intravenous injection of glycopyrrolate. A mean increase in heart rate similar to the Rautakorpi 1998 
article was shown. Again, anesthesia was provided concomitantly. The anesthesia consisted of thiopental, 
fentanyl, succinylcholine and anesthesia was maintained with 70% nitrous oxide and isoflurane. Most of these 
medicines will affect blood pressure and/or heart rate.  
Therefore articles by Rautakorpi (1994 and 1998) cannot be used to estimate if glycopyrronium has an 
influence on heart rate and/or blood pressure.  
The SmPC gives a warning statement about potential increases in heart rate produced with administration of 
Glycopyrronium bromide and also the known effect on blood pressure is described however information on 
heart rate and blood pressure changes in the treatment in children with neurological disorders is insufficient  
and uncertainty remains with regard to effects on heart rate specifically and to cardiovascular safety in 
general (see discussion on safety in this assessment report). 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Considering the revised titration schedule and the recommendation to administer Sialanar without food (as is 
the case of the reference product) a bridging to the data from the product used in the Zeller studies can be 
considered acceptable. All of the GP efficacy and safety data in the target population had been generated 
using oral formulations (Zeller, 2012 a and b, Mier, 2000, Blasco 1996, Stern 1997, and Bachrach 1998) and 
can therefore also be taken into account in the assessment. The i.v. and i.m. data has been used to support 
particular pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and safety discussions related to the drug substance per se 
and can be considered relevant for this purpose. 
However, even though during titration efficacy is to be balanced against tolerability in both products (Sialanar 
and the reference product used in the Zeller studies) both showed a high PK variability and pronounced food 
interaction and the effects may differ from day to day, and even from dose to dose. 
Concerns on potential detrimental effects of the high pharmacokinetic variability with Sialanar remain and it 
also remains uncertain if the plasma concentrations of Sialanar in children and adolescents with neurological 
disorder could cause clinically relevant side effects. Information is inadequate on areas of key interest where 
the pharmacology of glycopyrronium and/or the limited clinical data warrant attention or further 
investigation: adverse effects on heart rate and blood pressure, pneumonia and urinary retention. 
The pharmacological data submitted are considered very sparse and significant uncertainties remain. This is 
further discussed in the safety chapter of this report. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No separate dose-response studies were conducted. Instead, dose-response was addressed by using an 
individualised adaptive titration in fixed steps in studies Zeller, 2012a; Zeller, 2012b; Mier, 2000, but only 
one of these studies reported efficacy data by dose levels (Mier, 2000; see below).

2.5.2.  Main studies 
Zeller 2012a. Study title: A double blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral glycopyrrolate liquid (1 mg per 5 mL) for the 
management of problem drooling associated with cerebral palsy or other neurologic 
conditions in children 
This was a placebo controlled double-blind trial with eight weeks treatment (two parallel groups). The first 
four weeks comprised a titration in fixed steps to an individualized optimal dose elevel. 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Male or female ages 3 to 16 years. 
Other inclusion criteria were: 
•  Weigh at least 12.2 kg 
•  Have profuse or severe drooling in the absence of treatment so that clothing became damp on most days 
(approximately 5-7 days per week); and a diagnosis of CP and/or mental retardation or any other 
neurologic impairment or condition. 
•  A reliable P/C as determined by the Investigator is living with the subject. 
The protocols specifically allowed enrolment of subjects with tracheostomies or gastrostomy feeding tube 
Exclusion criteria were: 
• 
Pregnancy 
•  Use of GP liquid within approximately 24 hours prior to baseline 
•  Use of any of the prohibited anticholinergic or cholinergic medications specified in the protocol within 
three plasma half-lives of the medication prior to baseline 
•  Medical conditions contraindicating anticholinergic therapy including: Glaucoma, obstructive uropathy, 
uretovesicular reflux, reactive airway disease, myasthenia gravis, hyperthyroidism, cardiac arrhythmias 
and/or tachycardia, and/or clinically significant ECG abnormalities as determined by the investigator 
Treatments 
1:1 randomization to GP liquid (1 mg/5 mL) or matching placebo.  Study medication was administered tid at 
7–8 AM, 1–2 PM, and 7–8 PM by the parent/caregiver (or school nurse if the patient is in school during these 
hours of the day). Baseline measurements of safety and efficacy were made prior to being randomized to 
either the test product or placebo 
Since high fat meals reduce the oral BA of Cuvposa, P/C were advised to administer study drug at least 1 
hour before or 2 hours after meals 
Doses were titrated over the first four weeks to optimal response, beginning at 0.02 mg/kg tid up to 0.1 
mg/kg tid (not to exceed a maximum dose of 3 mg tid, regardless of weight). 
After starting at Dose Level 1, doses were increased every 5 to 7 days in increments of 0.02 mg/kg tid, 
according to a dose titration schedule.  If anticholinergic AEs became intolerable, the P/C was instructed to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 38/143 
  
  
contact the Investigator, who reduced the dosage to the previous dose-level in the schedule, with the subject 
continuing to use that dose-level for the remainder of the study (or until AEs require another reduction to the 
next-lowest dose-level). 
If no significant drug-related AEs were reported by the P/C, the investigator increased the subject’s dose to 
the next dosing level.  This continued during the 4 week time period, until an optimal individual response or a 
maximum of 0.1 mg/kg tid or 3 mg tid was attained, whichever was less.  During the titration period, 
investigators assessed subjects every 5 to 7 days by telephone and adjusted the dose until an optimal dose 
was achieved. 
The study assessed P/Cs ability to interpret the signs of efficacy and associated anticholinergic AEs.  During 
the study, each P/C reviewed instructional materials about titrating the dose and observing for AEs in 
subjects. Caregivers were allowed, through discussion with the child’s physician, to adjust dose levels due to 
concerns about AEs. 
Objectives 
Objectiv of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GP oral solution (Cuvposa) (1 mg/5 ml) in 
managing problem drooling associated with cerebral palsy (CP) and other neurological conditions.  Problem 
drooling was defined as drooling in the absence of treatment such that clothing became damp approximately 
5 7 days/week. 
To assess caregivers ability to identify AEs between visits so that an investigator can optimally titrate the 
dose. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was responder rate, based on change in degree (severity and frequency) of 
drooling, as measured by parents/caregivers, using the modified 9-point Teacher’s Drooling Scale (mTDS), 
which was assessed at baseline and at weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8.  The mTDS is scored from 1 (dry, never drools) 
to 9 (profuse: clothing, hands, tray, and objects become wet; frequently).  At the request of the FDA, the 
primary endpoint was changed to “dichotomized mTDS,” which defined responders as those having an 
increase ≥3 units on the mTDS.  During each of the scoring days, parents or caregivers (P/C) performed the 
evaluations.  The mTDS score for each evaluation day was calculated by using the mean of the last three 
daily assessments.  The baseline mTDS score for each subject was defined as the last day’s mTDS 
assessment before first dose of study medication.  For each subject, the change in score from the baseline 
score to the score at the last evaluation of the trial was calculated. 
Secondary outcomes/endpoints included Global Assessment of Treatment (1 to 5 scale anchored on strongly 
agree and strongly disagree for the statement “This is a worthwhile treatment” at Week 8 or last visit for 
withdrawals, and a separate P/C-Reported and Investigator-Reported Global Assessment of Training Manual 
at Week 8 or last visit for withdrawals asking “The training manual was helpful? Yes or no”. 
Sample size 
Thirty-eight subjects were randomised. No statistical justification for the sample size is reported, e.g. the 
smallest meaningful clinical difference for responder rate between the GOPOS group and the placebo group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 39/143 
  
  
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to glycopyrrolate or placebo three times per day. Those receiving 
anti-sialogenic compounds or other medications with anticholinergic or cholinergic activity underwent a 
washout phase prior to baseline, beginning 8 days before randomization.  
Blinding (masking) 
The test product and placebo were matching (similar in colour and taste). 
As patients receiving placebo would be expected to continue drooling chronically, caregivers of patients in 
this group were specifically encouraged to keep patients in the study until at least the end of the 4-week 
titration period. 
Statistical methods 
Data from all centres were combined. All percentages were based on the total number of patients in each 
group (two-sided P values). Patients who dropped out before the end of the study had the lowest rank carried 
forward. All statistical hypothesis tests used a type I (alpha) error of 0.05. All statistical calculations were 
performed using SAS® software (v 9.1.3; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). According to the statistical analysis plan, 
all patients who received at least one dose of study drug were to be included in the safety population, and all 
randomized patients were to be included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis of efficacy. In practice, two 
patients were randomized to treatment before the protocol was amended to set an upper age limit, and these 
patients no longer met the inclusion criteria. Thus, efficacy was assessed in a modified ITT (mITT) 
population, defined as all randomized patients who were within the age range of the final, amended protocol 
and received at least one dose of study medication. Consequently, these two patients were included in the 
analyses of safety but not of efficacy.

Recruitment 
This study was conducted between November 2002 and April 2007 in the USA. The study duration, from first 
patient screened to last patient completed, was approximately 4.5 years. 
Conduct of the study 
The study was conducted according to Good Clinical Practice guidelines and in full compliance with the World 
Assembly Declaration of Helsinki and its most recent amendments. Protocol was amended to set an upper 
age limit (to 16 years), which led to 1 fewer patient being included in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) 
population for the efficacy analysis for both the glycopyrrolate oral solution (1 mg/5 mL) and placebo groups. 
A temporary hold was placed on enrolment from November 2005 to September 2006 (10 months) pending 
receipt of US orphan drug designation for glycopyrrolate liquid, which was granted on June 9, 2006, for the 
indication “treatment of pathologic (chronic moderate to severe) drooling in paediatric patients” by the US 
Food and Drug Administration Office of Orphan Products Development.

Numbers analysed 
In the glycopyrronium group 19 subjects were analysed for efficacy out of 20 randomised subjects. The 
corresponding figures for the placebo group were 17 and 18 subjects, respectively. This modified intent-to-
treat (mITT) analysis excluded the two subjects with an age between 17 and 23 years randomised prior to an 
amendment of the protocol that restricted the study population age to 3-16 years. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
The responder rate at Week 8 for the primary endpoint (≥ 3 point improvement on the mTDS) was 
significantly higher for Cuvposa (14/19; 73.7%) than for placebo (3/17; 17.6%) (p = 0.0011, Fisher’s exact 
test), with improvements starting 2 weeks after treatment initiation (52.6% vs. 0%; p=0.00007) (Figure 1). 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Mean improvements in mTDS score at week 8 were 3.94 points (SD: 1.95, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
2.97–4.91, median: 4.30 points) in the glycopyrrolate oral solution group and 0.71 points (SD: 2.14, 95% 
CI: –0.43–1.84, median: 0.25 points) in the placebo group (P<0.0001). 
After 8 weeks treatment mean scores on the mTDS approximated to the descriptors “mild; only the lips are 
wet, but frequently” in the Cuvposa arm compared with the mid-point of “moderate; wet on the chin 
frequently” and “severe; drooling to the extent that clothing becomes damp occasionally” in the placebo arm. 
In total, 84.2% of Investigators and 100% of P/C regarded Cuvposa as worthwhile compared with 41.2% (p 
= 0.0140; Fisher’s exact test) and 56.3% (p = 0.0017), respectively, for placebo. 
Ancillary analyses 
A clinically relevant beneficial effect of Cuvposa was observed as early as 2 weeks after treatment initiation; 
in the publication, 52.6% in the Cuvposa arm were stated to be responders at this timepoint (vs. 0% in the 
placebo group; p=0.00007) (Figure 1).

Note: In reporting the results of this study, the authors of the publication used the US Approved Name for 
GP, i.e. glycopyrrolate. 
Consistent with the primary endpoint of responder rate, the mean mTDS score also improved (decreased) 
over time.  The difference between GP and placebo reached the level of statistical significance by Week 4.  By 
Week 8, a highly significant difference in mTDS between the two treatment arms was observed (p<0.0001).

had a daily dose from 0.1 mg/kg to 0.2 mg/kg; ten of the seventeen subjects who completed the trial 
reached the highest dose level for baseline weight (i.e. 0.3 mg/kg or 9 mg, whichever was less).  There were 
56 up and 11 down titrations. 
In the placebo group 15/17 (88.2%) completed the study; a larger proportion (14/17; 82.3%) were on the 
highest dose level.  There were 67 up and 3 down titrations. 
One subject in the placebo arm discontinued the study due to lack of efficacy; there were no discontinuations 
due to lack of efficacy in the GP arm.  
Mier et al 2010. Study title: Treatment of sialorrhoea with glycopyrrolate. A double-
blind, dose-ranging study. 
A placebo controlled cross-over study with two sequences each containing two treatment periods (either 
capsules glycopyrrolate or capsules placebo for eight weeks) in developmentally disabled children with 
sialorrhoea. 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Children aged 4 years and older, with neurodevelopmental conditions and severe sialorrhoea, were recruited.  
The admission criteria allowed previous treatment with medication against drooling (glycopyrrolate inclusive). 
Treatments 
Different GP dosing schemas were used based upon the weight of subjects at baseline with dosing based 
upon ter in die (tid) administration (Table below).

Note: The mean highest tolerated dose of GP among the 27 children who completed the study was 2.49 mg 
per dose (range 1.2 – 3.0 mg).  The mean highest tolerated dose of GP per kilogram body weight was 
0.11 mg/kg per dose (range: 0.04 – 0.2 mg/kg). 
Doses were increased weekly for 4 weeks to a maximum dose, which was then continued for an additional 4 
weeks.  Doses were increased according to this schedule unless adverse events (AEs) occurred or unless 
desired dryness, as defined by the P/C, was obtained. 
Oral GP was administered as a crushed and encapsulated (gelatin) presentation, which had been prepared 
extemporaneously by the study pharmacist by crushing commercially available Robinul tablets.  Otherwise 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016

identical placebo gelatin capsules contained lactose powder or cellulose.  These procedures were necessary to 
maintain the treatment blinding, since placebo tablets were not available.  P/C of children who were unable to 
swallow the capsules were instructed to take the capsule apart and place the powdered contents in the child’s 
food. Otherwise, no specific recommendations were given with regard to timing of medication and food. 
After an initial 1 week baseline medication free observation period, subjects were randomized to either GP or 
placebo, each for an 8 week treatment period.  At the end of the first period there was a 1 week washout, 
followed by a second week long observation period, then followed the reciprocal treatment arm, also 8 weeks 
long. Each treatment period contained a four-weeks titration phase and a four-weeks maintainance phase. 
Titration was done in weekly fixed steps (different doses per kg body weight depending on body weight above 
or under 30 kg) up to an individualized therapeutic optimal dose. 
Objectives 
To determine the safety and efficacy of glycopyrrolate in the treatment of developmentally disabled children 
with sialorrhoea. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Drooling was evaluated by P/C using the mTDS.  A set of cartoon illustrations was used to educate parents 
about this scale and was provided to them for home use. Drooling scores were obtained during the baseline 
observation periods and through weekly telephone calls to the parents by a research assistant. All scores 
were obtained in the afternoon, 2 hours after a dose.  
Caretakers were also asked to assess drooling and dryness of clothing. 
Sample size 
Thrirty-nine children began the study and 27 children completed it. 
Randomisation 
No details about the randomisation are provided.  
Blinding (masking) 
Because placebo tablets identical to commercially available glycopyrrolate were not available, capsules were 
specially compounded by a pharmacist, who ground up commercially available glycopyrrolate tablets and 
placed the required amount of powder into gelatin capsules. 
Statistical methods 
Tests of statistical significance included the paired, 2-tailed t test and the unpaired t test. Testing for 
statistical significance was only done for subjects who completed the study and with respect to mean 
treatment changes on mTDS. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Thirty-nine children began the study, and 27 children (69%) completed it. Of the 12 children who did not 
complete the study, 8 dropped out because of adverse effects to medication, 1 of these while receiving 
placebo. Four children were dropped because of failure to comply with the protocol or because it was 
inconvenient for their families to continue. The 4-months study was completed by 18 boys and 9 girls (Table 
below). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 46/143 
  
  
Recruitment 
The trial was conducted during the period 1998-1999. 
Conduct of the study 
Subjects were recruited at two identified sites in the USA.  These two sites were outpatient facilities in 
paediatric hospitals. The trial most likely followed the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Whether the 
trial followed the GCP rules applicable at that time could not be clarified. 
Baseline data 
Ages at enrollment ranged from 4 years 4 months to 19 years, with a mean age of 10 years 9 months. 
Thirty-four children had cerebral palsy; 1 each had Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, closed head injury, partial 
trisomy 22, congenital toxoplasmosis, and spinal muscular atrophy.  Eleven children had additional medical 
conditions, most commonly a seizure disorder (6 children) but also including autism, fetal alcohol syndrome, 
hydrocephalus, congenital heart disease, hypothyroidism, and retinitis pigmentosum.  Two children had 
tracheostomies, 1 of whom dropped out of the study because of excessively thick secretions.  Five children 
had been previously treated for their drooling with medication, 3 of whom had taken glycopyrrolate but 
stopped because of adverse effects. Weights at enrolment ranged from 11.5 kg to 61.9 kg. 
Numbers analysed 
In total 27 (of 39) subjects (69%) completed the cross-over study. No subject was withdrawn due to lack of 
efficacy. Only subjects completing the study were included in the efficacy analyses. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
The mean baseline drooling score improved with glycopyrrolate from 7.52 to a maximum mean score of 1.85.  
A mean score of 1.85 corresponds to a description between “dry, never drools” and “mild drooling; only the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 47/143 
  
  
 
lips are wet occasionally.” With placebo, the baseline score improved slightly from 7.44 to 6.33. Mean 
drooling score on glycopyrrolate (1.85) compared with placebo (6.33) is statistically different, with P<.001. 
Ancillary analyses 
Drooling scores improved with increasing dose in a linear manner. The mean score for children finishing the 
study was 6.0 on their first dose level, 4.5 on the second dose level, 3.6 on the third dose level, 2.6 on the 
fourth dose level, and 2.3 after 4 weeks at their highest dose. 
Using an improvement-in-drooling score of 4 points or greater as a standard for significant clinical 
improvement, 12%, 38%, 54%, and 81% of study participants met this standard on the first, second, third, 
and fourth dosing levels, respectively (Figure below). 
Figure 3 
The children were maintained at their highest tolerated dose for 4 weeks to determine if drug effects changed 
during that period; the drooling score improved in 9 children, decreased in 9, and remained the same in 9. 
Six (22%) of the 27 children who completed the study achieved their best drooling score while receiving 
doses lower than their fourth dosing level. Four of these 6 reached their best score 1 dosing level below their 
highest tolerated level. One child reached the best drooling score 2 dosing levels below the highest tolerated 
level, and another child reached the best score on the first dosing level. 
Of the caretakers who responded, 15 (65%) of 23 reported that their child exhibited less drooling odor while 
receiving glycopyrrolate compared with the placebo, and 21 (87%) of 24 caretakers reported improved 
dryness of clothing compared with placebo. 
The mean highest tolerated dose of glycopyrrolate among the 27 children who completed the study was 2.49 
mg, with a range from 1.2 mg to 3.0 mg per dose. The mean highest tolerated dose of glycopyrrolate per 
kilogram of body weight was 0.11 mg/kg per dose, with a range from 0.04 mg/kg to 0.2 mg/kg per dose.

Analysis description  Secondary analysis  
No other analysis datasets were presented in article. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The applicant provided broad description of studies Zeller 2012a , Mier et al, 2000 and Zeller et al 2012 as an 
analysis across the trials. Results of these studies were not statistically analysed (not possible to compare 
due to methodological differences) and therefore there are no new results presented. Therefore the 
assessment is the same as for efficacy results for single studies. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
No clinical studies in special populations were submitted by the Applicant which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
Supportive studies 
The four published supportive studies are summarised below. 
Zeller et al 2012. Study title: Safety and efficacy of glycopyrrolate oral solution for management 
of pathologic drooling in pediatric patients with cerebral palsy and other neurologic conditions. 
Background:  The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of oral glycopyrrolate solution 1 
mg/5 mL for 24 weeks in pediatric patients with chronic moderate to-severe drooling associated with cerebral 
palsy and other neurologic conditions. 
Methods:  In this multicenter, open-label, 24-week study, males and females aged 3–18 years weighing at 
least 27 lb received oral glycopyrrolate solution, starting at 0.02 mg/kg three times daily and titrated in 
increments of 0.02 mg/kg every 5–7 days for 4 weeks to an optimal maintenance dose or a maximum dose 
of 0.1 mg/kg, but not exceeding 3 mg three times daily.  Safety was assessed by description and tabulation 
of all adverse events.  The primary efficacy endpoint was response, defined as at least a three-point change 
from baseline to week 24 on the modified Teacher’s Drooling Scale. 
Results: One-hundred and three subjects out of 137 (75%) subjects completed the study; 2 subjects 
withdrew for lack of efficacy.  
The mean daily dose of Cuvposa was 0.15 mg/kg; 51% of subjects received a mean daily dose ≥ 0.1 mg/kg 
to ≤ 0.2 mg/kg, while 7% of subjects received the maximum dose (0.1 mg/kg tid).  Mean duration of 
exposure was 139.8 days, 76% of subjects had exposure >150 days to ≤ 200 days.  Over 24 weeks, 45% of 
subjects had a dose reduction. 
At Week 24, 52.3% (95% CI 43.7–60.9) of subjects were responders (≥ 3 point reduction on the mTDS).  
The proportion of responders ranged between 40.3% and 56.7% over the 6 assessment points during the 24 
Assessment report

week study period.  A higher proportion of non GP naïve subjects (n=53) were responders compared with GP 
naïve subjects (n=84) (59%; 95% CI 45.2-71.8 vs. 48%; 95% CI 36.9- 59.2). 
The proportions of subjects with profuse, severe, and moderate drooling decreased substantially from 
baseline to Week 24: 32% to 2%, 37% to 8%, and 32% to 26%, respectively.  By Week 24, 15% of subjects 
were non-droolers. 
P/C assessed improvement in their child’s drooling on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) (0-10 cm); the mean 
score improved from 6.56 at baseline to 3.21 at Week 24.  In total, 83.5% of P/C and 85.8% of investigators 
rated Cuvposa as being a worthwhile treatment. 
Stern 1997. Study title: Preliminary study of glycopyrrolate in the management of drooling 
Objective: A study was undertaken to assess the efficacy of an oral anticholinergic drug, glycopyrrolate, in 
the management of drooling in children and young adults with disabilities. 
Methodology: Glycopyrrolate was used once daily by 24 children and young adults for up to 28 months. 
Parents/carers were asked to complete a questionnaire on the effects of the drug on severity and frequency 
of drooling and to report any side-effects. 
Results: The dose titration scheme for GP was in the range 0.04 – 0.1 mg/kg/day with a maximum dose of 
0.175 mg/kg/day; the lower dose was used to initiate therapy and the dosage increased until a significant 
Assessment report

decrease or cessation of drooling occurred.  No information about final dose was given in the publication. The 
majority of the 22 subjects with data (out of 24) were reported to have shown improvement in both severity 
and frequency of drooling; no further details were provided.  The results, analysed using Wilcoxon signed 
rank analysis, were highly significant: for severity Z=3.6214; p=0.0003; for frequency Z=2.7064;

Blasco et al 1996. Study title: Glycopyrrolate treatment of chronic drooling  
Objective: To describe the use of glycopyrrolate in the control of drooling in children and young adults with 
cerebral palsy and related neurodevelopmental disabilities. 
Design: Prospective, open-label study of drug dosage parameters, response to therapy, and side effects. 
Follow-up ranged from 8 months to 4 years.  
Setting: Outpatient clinic of a rehabilitation hospital that is a regional referral center for children with 
disabilities. 
Patients: Forty children and young adults with motor and/or cognitive disabilities who were experiencing 
drooling to a severe degree.  
Intervention: Treatment with oral glycopyrrolate. 
Outcome Measures: Change in the quantity of drooling and side effects associated with treatment. 
Results: Thirty-six patients (90%) had reduced drooling in response to medication; 2 (5%) could not be 
assessed and 2 (5%) received no benefit.  Side effects resulted in discontinuation of treatment in 11 (28%).  
Overall, 26 (65%) continued to receive drug therapy because of the perceived benefit.  The final effective 
dose ranged widely from 0.01 to 0.82 mg/kg per day. 
Arbouw et al 2010. Study title: Glycopyrrolate for sialorrhoea in Parkinson disease. A randomized, 
double-blind, crossover trial 
Background: Sialorrhoea affects approximately 75% of patients with Parkinson disease (PD). Sialorrhoea is 
often treated with anticholinergics, but central side effects limit their usefulness. Glycopyrrolate 
(glycopyrronium bromide) is an anticholinergic drug with a quaternary ammonium structure not able to cross 
the blood-brain barrier in considerable amounts.  Therefore, glycopyrrolate exhibits minimal central side 
effects, which may be an advantage in patients with PD, of whom a significant portion already experience 
cognitive deficits. 
Objective: To determine the efficacy and safety of glycopyrrolate in the treatment of sialorrhoea in patients 
with PD.  
Methods: A 4-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial with oral glycopyrrolate 1 
mg 3 times daily in 23 patients with PD.  Treatment with either glycopyrrolate or placebo was one week each.  
The severity of the sialorrhoea was scored on a daily basis by the patients or a caregiver with a sialorrhoea 
scoring scale ranging from 1 (no sialorrhoea) to 9 (profuse sialorrhoea).  
Results: Both primary (p=0.021) and secondary (p=0.011) outcome measures of sialorrhoea improved with 
glycopyrrolate compared with placebo.  For the primary endpoint, nine of 23 patients (39.1%) responded to 
glycopyrrolate vs 1 of 23 patients to placebo (4.3%; difference in responder rate 34.8%, bootstrap 95% CI 
13.0%–56.5%).  The mean improvement in sialorrhoea score with glycopyrrolate compared with placebo was 
0.8 points (bootstrap 95% CI 0.02–1.4 points).  One patient inadvertently used 5 times the prescribed 
volume during 3 days in the first week of trial medication, in which he had been using glycopyrrolate.  In the

per-protocol analysis, with exclusion of this patient, the primary outcome did not change.  The secondary 
outcome measures in the per-protocol analysis were as follows: mean (SD) sialorrhoea score 4.7 (1.7) with 
placebo vs 3.9 (1.6) with glycopyrrolate (p=0.015). 
Mapping exercise to estimate utility values for drooling in cerebral palsy (QoL Mapping) 
Chang et al. 2012 was a study to investigate the association between drooling in children with cerebral 
palsy and their health-related quality of life (HRQOL), as well as the possible variables that predict their 
HRQOL. Children with CP, without other identified disease, aged 2 to 6 years, who drool (n = 33) or did not 
drool (n = 14), were included. The dependent variables were the physical health summary scores and the 
psychosocial health summary scores of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory version 4.0. 
Results: The physical health and psychosocial health summary scores of the children that drooled (16.29 ± 
15.97 and 42.92 ± 17.57, respectively) were lower than for the children that did not drool (31.97 ± 22.22 
and 57.09 ± 12.21, respectively; P , 0.01). The drooling ranking score was negatively correlated with the 
physical health summary score (r = −0.355; P , 0.05) and the psychosocial health summary score (r = 
−0.381; P , 0.01). The stepwise regression showed that gross motor development and the drooling ranking 
score predicted 56.6% of the variability of the physical health summary score (R2 = 0.566; P , 0.01). The 
language development score predicted 25.6% of the variability of the psychosocial health summary score (R2 
= 0.256; P , 0.01). 
Drooling was associated with a lower HRQOL. Prediction of the physical health summary score was more 
closely associated with gross motor development and the drooling ranking scores. 
Khan et al. 2014 assesses different mapping methods for estimating EQ-5D health utilities from PedsQLTM 
GCS responses.  
The primary objectives of this exercise were to: 
• 
Estimate EQ-5D utilities from the Pediatric Quality of Life questionnaire v4  (PedsQL) based on the 
Khan et al., (2014) mapping algorithm using a Taiwanese  dataset provided, and previously described 
and published, by Chang et al., (2012). 
•  Generate descriptive statistics for the estimated utility scores across the following drooling groups 
based on the Drooling Rating Scale (DRS) data included in the Chang et al, dataset: 
•  Drools vs. never drools (A proxy of the Modified Teachers Drooling Scale (mTDS) including the 
categories: never drools, mild/moderate drooling and severe/profuse drooling) 
Methods 
Patient level PedsQL domin scores (Physical, Emotional, Social and School, Functioning) were provided by the 
authors of Chang et al. 2012 and were utilized to derive all the variables required to estimate EQ-5D utilities 
based on the Khan et al., mapping algorithm.  
In other words, utility scores were estimated from the Chang et al. PedsQL data using the published 
coefficients in the following algorithm: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 56/143 
  
  
 
 
 
Drooling groups 
It was possible to define drooling groups, using the drooling rating scale patient level data provided by the 
authors of the Chang et al. paper. By defining drooling groups it was then possible to estimate health state 
utilities for each drooling group. The drooling rating scale has a score ranging from 2 to 9 based on the sum 
of drooling severity and drooling frequency as outlined in the table below: 
For the assessment of Never Drools vs Drools, a score 2 was classified as Never Drools and a score > 2 as 
Drools. 
For the proxy truncated mTDS groups: Never drools was defined as before, Mild/Moderate Drooling included 
DRS severity scores of 2/3 combined with any frequency score > 1, and Severe/Profuse Drooling included 
DRS severity scores of 4/5 combined with any frequency score >1. 
Categorical groups of the DRS and a truncated version of the mTDS were used since the sample size in the 
dataset was known a priori to be too small (n=47) to consider all eight DRS categories and all nine mTDS 
groups.  
Results and Discussion 
From the original sample, a total of 31 subjects had sufficiend PedsQL data to enable the estimation of utility 
scores. The main reason utility could not be estimated was due to missing School Functioning domain scores.  
Hence the Never Drools vs. Drools utility values summarized in Table 2 include a sample of n=31. The utility 
data presented by truncated mTDS groups in Table below, includes n=30, as one subject did not provide 
sufficient data to be categorized into the mTDS proxy group.

The group means show a monotonic relationship between drooling and utility indicating decreased utility 
(decreased health related quality of life) with increased drooling.  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
No dose response studies within the clinical efficacy data package were provided; instead analysis of clinical 
information relevant to dosing recommendation was presented.  
Dose titration is recommended in current drug formularies and the main treatment reference texts in UK 
including the British National Formulary for Children and the Association of Paediatric Palliative Medicine. An 
on-going clinical trial of another oral solution presentation of GP is using the APPM dose titration 
recommendations (Parr, 2014; EudraCT: 2013-000863-94): 40 μg/kg initial dose with 20 μg/kg increases to 
100 μg/kg in Week 4, with a maximum individual dose of 2 mg (equivalent to 0.2 mg/kg at the smallest 
eligible weight [10 kg]). 
There are no dedicated dose-finding studies or multiple-dose pharmacodynamic studies, which would identify 
appropriate dose. The therapeutic dose-range therefore has to be inferred from the two main studies and 
particularly from the study by Zeller 2012a.  
Data from a comparative BA study conducted by the Applicant in healthy adults indicate that the proposed 
product, GBOS (0.4 mg/mL [Sialanar]) is approximately 25% more bioavailable than Cuvposa on average 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 58/143 
  
  
 
 
(based on AUC(o-t)). Maximum exposure (Cmax) after a single 2 mg dose of GBOS (0.4 mg/mL) is 
approximately 21% higher than after the same dose of Cuvposa.  
The significant difference in bioavailability between the two formulations was a major concern to the CHMP 
because one could question the originally proposed initial dose and dose titration schedule for GBOS (which 
was identical to that of Cuvposa) both with regard to efficacy and safety. However, the recommended 
schedule has been revised so that it no longer is a copy of the one adopted for Cuvposa in the US, but 
instead applies a 20% lower initial dose and 20% lower dose increments reflecting that the exposure 
following GBOS is approximately 20-25% higher than following Cuvposa. Hence, the exposure levels during 
titration of GBOS would largely mirror those obtained during titration of Cuvposa. The revised titration 
schedule earlier proposed by the Applicant is considered the only appropriate solution when considering the 
markedly higher exposure of GBOS as compared to Cuvposa and is thus acceptable. 
Main study Zeller 2012a 
In the absence of regulatory guidelines, the claimed design of this study is adequate for the purpose of 
demonstrating short-term efficacy.  The Applicant clarified during the procedure that the trial most likely had 
a double-blind design. The study population with a lowest age limit of three years does not support the 
originally proposed SmPC with a lower age limit of two years, otherwise the study population was adequately 
selected.  However, the Applicant proposed in the course of the procedure to limit the lowest age in the 
indication to be three years which is acceptable. The eligibility criteria allowed previous use of GP, which 
theoretically could bias internal and external validity.  However, since quite few subjects had previous GP use 
and were balanced between the treatment groups this is not likely that previous use of GP in the Zeller 2012a 
study did bias the study results. The use of placebo as the only comparator is supported since no other anti-
sialorrhoea product has been extensively authorised in the EU. The choice of mTDS as the primary outcome 
measurement is also supported and using it for a responder analysis (with a responder representing a ≥3 
points improvement) as the primary endpoint and mTDS mean change as a secondary endpoint is further 
endorsed.   
The CHMP questioned whether the 8-weeks treatment duration is sufficient to support chronic use of GP. Only 
one long-term published article of a sufficient study design for safety evaluation, Zeller 2012b, has been 
presented and this was only a 24-week non-comparative study with 137 patients. The efficacy results from a 
trial with such a design are only indicative of long-term efficacy. 
Therefore a description of the study was included in 5.1 of the SmPC and a statement that Placebo controlled 
efficacy data includes patients with treatment duration of 8 weeks. There is no placebo or comparator 
controlled data beyond 8 weeks. Furthermore it was included that there is insufficient data beyond 24 weeks 
to establish the long-term efficacy and safety profile of glycopyrronium in the target population. The 
recommended maximum duration of therapy is 24 weeks. 
Fisher´s exact test is an appropriate statistical test method for the primary endpoint.  An estimate of the 
variation, e.g. a bootstrapped 95% confidence interval, should preferably also have been included in the 
statistical test methods of the primary endpoint.  The Applicant has in its response clarified that such an 
estimate of the variation is not possible to provide due to lack of access to raw data.  The scheduling of the 
IMP dosing with a standardised time window before and after intake of meal was appropriate. 
The study was conducted according to GCP.  
The reporting of the results has limitations which are the usual inherent with a bibliographic application. 
Main study Mier 2010 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 59/143 
  
  
In the absence of regulatory guidelines, the design of this study is also adequate for the purpose of 
demonstrating short-term efficacy.  The study population with a lowest age limit of four years does not 
support the proposed SmPC with a lower age limit of originally two years, now revised to three years. The 
study population was not extensively described.  Also in this trial, the eligibility criteria allowed previous use 
of GP, which theoretically could bias internal and external validity. Since only five subjects were previously 
treated with GP, the Applicant has in its response made it probable that this potential bias was most likely 
limited. The use of placebo as the only comparator is once again supported since no other anti-sialorrhoea 
product has been extensively authorised in the EU. The choice of mTDS as the presumed primary outcome 
measurement is also supported and supposedly using it for the primary endpoint mTDS mean change is 
further endorsed.  However, as with Zeller 2012a main study, one certainly can question if the 8-weeks 
treatment duration is sufficient to support chronic use of GP and as already mentioned the Applicant has now 
in the PI limited the treatment duration to 24 weeks with an adequate description of the limitations in terms 
of long-term efficacy data.  
Tests of statistical significance included the paired, 2-tailed t test and the unpaired t test. Testing for 
statistical significance was only done for subjects who completed the study and with respect to mean 
treatment changes on mTDS.  The statistical tests are sub-optimal in a cross-over trial, the standard test is 
ANOVA with factors: Sequence, subject, period, and treatment where subject to be nested in sequence.  The 
Applicant has not managed to provide additional information allowing an ANOVA statistical testing, but this is 
justifiable since it is not critical for the benefit risk-balance.  The lack of an ITT analysis with appropriate 
imputation technique could be a significant limitation to the interpretability of the study results depending on 
the number of subjects who did not complete the study.  The Applicant clarified that the weekly assessments 
reflected an average impression of the drooling for the last seven days. 
The scheduling of the IMP dosing without a standardised time window before and after intake of meal makes 
the rate and extent of absorption to study drug more variable.  But GP administered with food would be 
expected to reduce the BA of GP and bias the study towards the ‘null hypothesis’ i.e. no difference between 
GP and placebo in terms of efficacy and tolerability. For the purpose of demonstrating overall efficacy in the 
study by Mier et al, the matter about food intake is therefore less of an issue. 
The Applicant has not been able to confirm that the trial was conducted according to GCP rules applicable at 
that time. The reporting of the results has limitations which are the usual ones inherent with a bibliographic 
application. It is highlighted that this publication mix study methods with study results which does not 
facilitate its interpretation. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Main study Zeller 2012a 
The treatment effects seen on mTDS (responder analysis with 56.1% placebo subtracted responders on GP 
and mean change placebo subtracted improvement of 3.23 on GP) were clinically relevant although a 
smallest clinically meaningful difference was not reported as a basis for the sample size estimate. 
The study population, with around 15% previous GP use in both treatment arms, was representative for the 
patient population which should allow for a reasonable generalizability of the study results.  The limited 
previous use of GP should not have biased the study results. 
Uncertainties remain, with respect to baseline factors like age, gender, race and ethnicity.  Furthermore, an 
analysis estimating the variation for the primary endpoint (e.g. a bootstrapped 95% confidence interval) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 60/143 
  
  
would have been informative.  Another uncertainty pertains to the lack of separate outcome data for 
subgroups of young children, older children and adolescents, respectively.  . 
Main study Mier 2010 
The treatment effects seen on mean mTDS (improvement with glycopyrrolate from 7.52 to a maximum mean 
score of 1.85; placebo from 7.44 to 6.33) were clinically relevant although, as for the Zeller 2012a study, a 
smallest clinically meaningful difference was not reported as a basis for the sample size estimate.  However, 
there are significant caveats in terms of the statistical test method used, the small sample size, and that the 
efficacy analysis was only performed for subject who completed the trial (27 subjects out of 39 subjects 
randomised).  As for the latter point, in its response the Applicant made a conservative simulated data 
analysis on all 39 randomised subjects with BOCF for the 12 subjects who discontinued the trial and were not 
included in the published analysis.  This decreased the placebo-subtracted mean treatment effect from 4.56 
(in the published per-protocol analysis) to 3.06 on mTDS.  The latter numerical difference of 3.06 is 
reassuring although it is not known whether this difference is statistically significant. 
The study population that completed the trial is not described in detail, and no account is given for the 
subjects who dropped out. This puts question marks as to whether the study population was representative 
for the patient population and complicates the generalizability of the study results.  As for the Zeller 2012a 
study, the limited previous use of GP should not have biased the study results. 
Also one-third of the subjects deteriorated after having been titrated to their maintenance dosing. The MAH 
clarified that sialorrhoea is a condition in which the severity waxes and wanes over time, even on a daily 
basis (Blasco, 2002). As well as variation in response to treatment due to fluctuations in disease severity, 
other factors may have played a part such as administration of glycopyrronium bromide (GP) with vs. without 
food, and the established intra-subject variability in bioavailability of GP, which may have been more 
significant in this study given the extemporaneous (pharmacy-prepared) capsules that were used. 
Uncertainties with this study relates to the study population not supporting the treatment age as of three 
years in the proposed SmPC), but a treatment age as of four years.  Other important uncertainties relate to 
the statistical test method used for the primary endpoint and the high percentage of subjects with early 
discontinuation (31%) combined with a statistical efficacy analysis only encompassing subjects who 
completed the trial. 
The long-term study by Zeller et al, 2012b was an open label clinical trial without placebo control. The 
reported responder rate at week 24 was based on 130 subjects (out of 137 originally enrolled subjects) 
suggests a reasonable maintenance effect over a 24-weeks treatment period among subjects who responded 
however the efficacy results from this trial cannot be considered conclusive, but only indicative of long-term 
efficacy due to the limitations of the trial design. Based on the limited evidence on long term use the 
Applicant reduced the duration of use in the SmPC to 24 weeks to mirror the available efficacy data.  
Supportive studies by Stern 1997, Blasco et al 1996 used different formulation of GP compared to the 
applicants preparation and were conducted in mixed paediatric-young adult population. The publications 
provide only limited methodological information and no comparative treatment/placebo were used. No 
conclusions with regards to efficacy can be drawn due the limitations of the trial design.  
Also Arbouw et al 2010 used a different formulation of GP compared to the applicant’s preparation. This trial 
demonstrates proof-of-concept for treatment of sialorrhoea in PD subjects and generally suggests proof-of-
mechanism in the treatment of sialorrhoea. However no conclusions with regards to efficacy in paediatric 
subjects with sialorrhoea can be drawn due to the chosen study population. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016

There are no specific data presented with glycopyrronium to assess its effect on quality of life (QoL). The 
Applicant submitted data on a mapping exercise to estimate utility values for drooling in cerebral palsy (QoL 
Mapping). 
There are several limitations in relation to this analysis. The sample size was small and relationships between 
utility and drooling and other Cerebral Palsy severity characteristics have not been considered. Also the 
mapping algorithm was developed based on a different population (healthy children attending secondary 
school), including a different age cohort (11 – 15 year olds, rather than 2 – 6 year olds included in the Chang 
et al., dataset), and based on self-report, rather than proxy report in the Chang et al., study. 
From the analysis the difference in quality of life in paediatric patients with cerebral palsy is significant 
between patients who drool and those who never drool. This is further supported by the evident decreasing of 
quality of life linked to increasing severity of drooling. However, the analysis does not take into account for 
the possible very unpleasant adverse effects of Sialanar, which would affect the Quality of life during 
treatment.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The two main studies for demonstrating clinical efficacy, which exposed less than 50 subjects to treatment 
with GP in the claimed indication, both met their primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. Taken together 
these studies only support a treatment age as of three years and the indication was adapted by the applicant 
accordingly. The Zeller 2012a study has some methodological limitations and the Meier study has 
considerable uncertainties. None of the studies support chronic use of GP in paediatric subjects with 
sialorrhoea from a clinical efficacy perspective. Nor does the Zeller 2012b study with a 24-weeks treatment, 
which was open label without placebo comparison. A maximum treatment duration of 24 weeks was proposed 
by the applicant which is more appropriate, considering the available efficacy data. 
Both the main studies were performed with other formulations/preparations than the Applicant’s product, and 
bioequivalence has not been established between these formulations/preparations.  On the contrary, the 
Applicant’s preparation (Sialanar) and tablets of GP (used in the Mier study to compound capsules) have a 
higher bioavailability than the product used in the Zeller 2012a study. Therefore the recommended initial 
dose and dose titration schedule has been revised taking into account the higher bioavailability of the 
Sialanar formulation. With the revision of the dose recommendations, it is reasonable to conclude that the 
efficacy results of the Zeller studies can be applied to Sialanar. 
As reflected in the mapping exercise, the quality of life in children with pathological drooling due to cerebral 
palsy is clearly affected compared to children with cerebral palsy who do not drool.  
This is not disputed; there is however a concern that any improvement would be offset by the presence of 
detrimental adverse effects associated with the treatment. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety data presented in support of this application in children with neurological disorders are derived 
from six published articles; Zeller 2012a, Zeller 2012b, Mier 2000, Blasco 1996, Stern 1997 and Bachrach 
1998. The studies presented in the Zeller articles were the pivotal studies for the approved reference product 
(Cuvposa). Supportive articles of the use of GP in adults as well as the Applicants proof of market research, 
the Proveca report, and a MHRA DAP (Drug Analysis Print) has also been provided.

Exposure in referenced adult studies 
The study by Arbouw et al, 2010 was conducted in adult subjects (N=23; mean [SD] age: 70 ± 7.8 years), 
predominantly (19/23, 82.6%) of male gender with PD (mean [SD] duration: 10.2 ± 8.6 years), with a mean 
(SD) baseline sialorrhoea score, assessed using the mTDS, of 6.5 ± 1.3. 
The comparative PK study, PRO/GLY/001, conducted by the Applicant was performed in adult healthy 
volunteers (N=66; mean [SD] age: 24.5 ± 6.6 years), predominantly (39/66, 59.1%) of male gender.  The 
majority of subjects (80%) were black. 
Adverse events  
When assessing the occurrence of adverse events it is important to know how the adverse events have been 
collected. The six studies, which provide the safety data on children with neurological disorders, all employed 
different methods of capturing the AEs.   
Oral solution: Zeller, 2012a and Zeller, 2012b 
A large part of the AE monitoring in the trials was conducted in conjunction with each subject’s 
parent/caregiver (P/C). The P/C used a diary. The diary contained a specific checklist of anticholinergic 
associated AEs as well as other general signs associated with AEs.  In particular, the diary included the 28 
item modified Behavioural and Medical Rating Scale (mBMRS) (table below), which was developed by 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 64/143 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Camp-Bruno et al, 1989.  This scale was designed to uncover expected cholinergic affects as well as subtle 
AEs by probing for both signs and symptoms of AEs. The diary was completed 3-times-per week by P/C.  The 
mBMRS, which was also used by investigators, aided in the identification of possible AE-related behaviours 
and physiological effects in individuals taking GP.

Safety was also evaluated with the following clinical testing: 
1.  Physical examination at Screening and Week 8 (Zeller, 2012a) or Week 24 (Zeller, 2012b); 
2.  12-lead ECG at Screening and Week 8 (Zeller, 2012a) or Weeks 4, 12, and 24 (Zeller, 2012b); 
3.  Clinical laboratory evaluations (blood chemistry, haematology, and urinalysis) at Screening and Week 8 
(Zeller, 2012a) or Week 24 (Zeller, 2012b); and 
4.  Vital sign measurements at Screening and during Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 (Zeller, 2012a) or Weeks 1, 4, 
8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 (Zeller, 2012b). 
If a subject prematurely withdrew from the study before the last scheduled visit, safety assessments were 
performed at the time of discontinuation from the study. 
Specific laboratory testing included: 
1.  Haematology: haemoglobin, haematocrit, red blood cell count (RBC), white blood cell count, differential 
WBC count, (i.e., neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes), platelets; 
2.  Serum biochemistry: creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, glucose, 
alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma glutamyl 
transferase, total bilirubin, calcium, phosphorus, uric acid, cholesterol, total protein, albumin; 
3.  Urinalysis: dipstick (leukocytes, protein, blood, glucose, ketones); if abnormal: microscopic sediment 
examination (erythrocytes, leukocytes, bacteria, casts, epithelial cells); 
4.  Thyroid stimulating hormone and free T4 (in nonverbal, non-mobile patients): to screen for 
hyperthyroidism which can exist undetected in nonverbal, non-mobile patients; 
5.  Urine or blood pregnancy test: (if applicable). 
In the studies by Zeller et al, clinically significant events were defined in the protocol as follows: 
 “Hematology values, blood chemistry values, urine values, and seizure grades that worsen more than one 
toxicity grade from baseline will be considered clinically significant (e.g., Grade 0 at baseline worsens to 
Grade 2, or Grade 1 at baseline worsens to Grade 3.)”. 
Since this patient population has a relatively high prevalence of seizure disorder, the baseline seizure grade 
was established through each subject’s history (given by their P/C) before the subject started the trial.  
Changes from baseline were analyzed at the end of the study. 
In the Zeller 2012a article it is stated that all 20 (100%) patients treated with glycopyrrolate oral solution 
and 15 of 18 (83.3%) who received placebo had at least one treatment-emergent AE (TEAE), including 15 
(75%) and seven (39%), respectively, who had TEAEs considered by the investigator to be related to 
treatment. Four patients (20%) in the glycopyrrolate oral solution group, but none in the placebo group, had 
at least one severe. The most frequent AEs are shown below:

Table 17 
In the open-label study by Zeller et al, 2012b, 89% of subjects had at least one TEAE, most frequently 
constipation (20.4%). Most patients (n = 122; 89%) had at least one treatment- emergent adverse event, 
47% of which were deemed related to oral GP, with most being mild-to-moderate in intensity. The most 
commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events are summarised in the table below:

Note: the publication does not state if this is individual or daily dose.  Given the range is above that of an 
individual dose, the Applicant believes these doses are daily doses. 
It is clear that typical anticholinergic AEs occurred with a higher incidence in the GP arm than in the placebo 
arm in the Zeller 2012a article. This is in contrast to what was found in the placebo controlled study by 
Arbouw, 2010 in adults with Parkinson’s disease (GP 1 mg of a 0.2 mg/mL admixture or placebo). In this 
study there were no significant differences in AEs between GP and placebo treatment. Although this is an 
indirect comparison, and as such be interpreted with caution, the AE profile of GP in adults cannot readily be 
extrapolated to children. This thus supports the importance of sufficient placebo controlled safety data in 
children. There is no information in the Zeller 2012a article on dose dependent AEs which would have been 
valuable information. There is only information on how many had a dose increase (56 up-titrations) and 
decrease (11 down-titrations).  Additionally, there is no information on the incidence of AE per age group. 
The open-label Zeller 2012b (n=137) study confirms that typical anticholinergic AEs were seen. 89% of the 
patient had an AE, 47% of which were deemed related to GP. Additionally, the information on dose 
dependent AEs show that a higher dose is associated with a higher incidence of AE. However, as this was an 
open label study the exact incidence of an AE at a certain dose level should be interpreted with caution. 
Crushed encapsulated Robinul tablets: Mier, 2000: 
P/C were questioned each week by telephone regarding the presence of any of 15 pre-specified AEs (see 
table further above Adverse events listed in instruments used for capturing parental/caregiver reports in 
pivotal studies of glycopyrronium bromide for sialorrhoea) as well as the presence of any other events that 
were not on the list.  A physical examination was performed at each visit, with particular attention paid to the 
presence of erythema, maceration or induration around the mouth, weight, and blood pressure.

The Mier, 2000 article mentions that younger children tended to exhibit adverse effects more often than older 
children and that, the difference did not achieve statistical significance. 
The Mier, 2000 study differs from the Zeller, 2012a study on several key points and is not considered to be a 
pivotal safety study. Furthermore, from the limited information provided on the collection of AEs it is evident 
that this was performed differently than in the Zeller study. However, 25 (69%) children had an AE while 
taking GP versus 5 (17%) taking placebo. Many had the same frequent AEs as described in the Zeller articles, 
though behavioural changes was seen in 23% of the children in the Mier trial. Behavioural change was not 
described as an AE occurring with a frequency of more than 15% in the Zeller 2012a article. Somnolence is 
the only AE in the Zeller 2012b article which can be categorised as a behavioural change. It occurred with a 
frequency of 8.6% in the middle dose and 2.6% in the high dose category. The Blasco, et al 1996, article 
reported of behavioural changes in 13% of the children. These differences in frequency of AEs, which could 
be categorized as behavioural changes, are surprising. 
The placebo-controlled study by Mier, 2000 seems to confirm that the AEs are more frequently seen with high 
doses (more than 0.08 mg/kg/dose). This level corresponds to the Applicant’s proposed dose level 4 and 5.   
Stern et al 1997, open label study 
The AEs reported the Stern et al 1997 (n=24), open label study should be interpreted with caution, as the 
information provided in the article is not sufficient to assess if the capture of the AEs was done satisfactorily. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016

It is mentioned that “They were asked to report possible side-effects or any concerns they had. Close contact 
was maintained with all the participants. Duration of therapy varied from 5 weeks to 28 months. Sometime 
after the end of the trial parents were asked to complete a questionnaire in order to assess the effect of 
glycopyrrolate.”  Only the caregiver/parent assessed AEs, and it not known when the AEs were reported. This 
could lead to a risk of significant underreporting. This insufficient way of capturing AEs is most likely reflected 
in the recorded AEs  which were: thirst in hot weather in two children, dilated pupils in one child, one report 
of flushed face, constipation in two children, bad breath in one child and dry lips in one child.

One patient had AEs of irritability and skin flushing  
All patients were prescribed glycopyrrolate, starting at a dose of 0.5 mg once or twice daily. It is stated that 
“Patient responses and side effects were initially monitored by telephone every 5 to 10 days to establish the 
effective dose clinically and to monitor for benefits and side effects”. Follow-up ranged from 8 months to 4 
years. This means that only the patient and/or presumably the caregiver/parent assessed AEs. Additionally, it 
is mentioned that there was a regular initial monitoring. It is not stated how long the monitoring period was. 
This way of capturing AES could explain the differences in the incidence of reported AEs compared to the 
Zeller (and Mier) article. Surprisingly, 68% did not experience any AEs. Those that did experience an AE 
experienced the same type of AEs as in the Zeller studies except for irritability.   
Bachrach 1998, retrospective survey 
17/37 (46%) GP-treated patients experienced AEs.  The most commonly reported events were dry mouth 
and/or thick secretions in 7/37 (18.9%), urinary retention in 7/37 (18.9%), flushing in 4/37 (10.8%), 
constipation in 2/37 (5.4%), pseudo-obstruction in 1/37 (2.7%), and agitation and personality change in 
1/37 (2.7%).

54 patients were identified for whom antisialorrheic medication had been prescribed for treatment of either 
excessive drooling or tracheal secretions. Questionnaires were mailed to these families. A total of 41 
questionnaires were completed (76%). The questionnaire asked for parents or caretakers to indicate whether 
their child was still taking medication for drooling, what the medication was, and whether they had 
experienced any side effects from medication. Potential anticholinergic side effects were described to the 
parents before the medication was started. 37 of 41 were treated with GP. Seventeen of 37 (46%) reported 
that their children experience adverse events while taking glycopyrrolate. The most frequently reported 
adverse event were AEs also frequently reported in the Zeller study. It is mentioned that there was no 
difference in the dose between those who experienced an AE and those who did not. However, it not known 
when the child experienced the AE and given the design of the study there is a high risk of underreporting. 
Analysis of Adverse Events by Organ System or Syndrome 
GI system:  GI comorbidity is common in individuals with CP. Thus, primarily placebo controlled trials can be 
used to ascertain if GP causes GI adverse effects.  
It is evident from the two placebo-controlled studies, Zeller, 2012a and Mier, 2000 that GI AEs occurred more 
frequently in children treated with GP than with placebo. The Zeller, 2012a article; constipation (30% vs. 
22%) and vomiting (30% vs. 11%). Mier, 2000 article; constipation (18% vs. 0%), vomiting (10%. vs. 0%) 
and diarrhea (10% vs. 3%). 
Renal function and urogenital system: Regarding urinary retention, the two placebo controlled studies, Zeller 
2012a and Mier 2000 report that 13-15% patients had urinary retention while treated with GP vs. 0% when 
treated with placebo. There is no information on the severity of the urinary retention or if it was associated 
with an increased incidence of urinary tract infections. Additionally, as GP is intended as chronic treatment 
there could be a risk of chronic urinary retention leading damage to the bladder by overextension. 
Additionally, there is a risk of reflux leading to tubular atrophy and, eventually, irreversible renal injury. 
Cardiovascular system including ECG: GP, as an anticholinergic, is expected to result in hear rate (HR) 
increase. There is no information on how much HR increases with GP treatment in children with neurological 
disorders.  
The only article to mention ECG results is Zeller, 2012b. It is stated that there was no abnormal or clinically 
significant shifts in ECG findings in subject who had had an ECG at baseline and at week 24. The number of 
patients with baseline and week 24 ECG recordings is not stated. Additionally, there are insufficient details 
regarding the ECG result allow an independent review. Furthermore, as the tachycardic effects are dose-
related and because of the fact that the Applicant oral solution of GP, GBOS, is 25% more bioavailable, the 
ECG results obtained from the Zeller study, where Cuvposa was used, cannot readably be extrapolated. 
However, the plasma concentrations in the PRO/GLY/001 study, conducted in healthy adults with a mean 
dose of 0.03 mg /kg, was comparable to the plasma concentrations in the QT interval study by Drollman et 
al, 2014. This study investigated QT prolongation properties of inhaled GP in adults and found that the GP 
doses tested did not cause QT prolongation. Sialanar simulated plasma concentration (Cmax) is around 962 
pg/ml (median=941 pg/ml) in 3 year old children, i.e. the youngest included in the indication and thus 
selected for simulation as representative of the worst case scenario. The upper limit of the 95% confidence 
interval is of around 2000 pg/ml. This is comparable to the plasma concentrations in the QT interval study by 
Drollman et al, 2014.   
CNS: The highly polar quaternary ammonium group of GP limits its passage across lipid membranes, such as 
the blood brain barrier (BBB). In adults, GP does not seem to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB). However, 
in a study in children with hydrocephalus, GP was detected in the CSF. This suggests that GP might pass the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 72/143 
  
  
 
BBB. Additionally, non-clinical data suggest that GP could cross the BBB in some species (please refer to non-
clinical AR). The articles by Zeller do not mention frequent CNS AEs. However in the Mier, 2000 article, 23% 
treated with GP vs. 3% treated with placebo had behavioural changes. It is not known if GP affects 
neurodevelopment. 
Oral mucosa and teeth: Decreased salivation may also increase the risk of developing oral diseases and make 
patients susceptible to mucositis, especially candidiasis.  A possible consequence of reduced salivary flow is 
an increased risk of dental caries. In particular in subjects with more advanced neurological disorders, 
development of caries would be a major concern since this group of patients often need dental treatment 
under general anaesthesia. The increased risk of dental caries has been added as a warning to the SmPC.   
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious Adverse Events 
SAEs were reported in both Zeller studies and also in the Applicant’s comparative PK study (PRO/GLY/001). 
No information regarding SAEs are available in the other studies of GP in children with neurological disorders. 
The SAE in the PK study with adults was tonsillitis and is not considered treatment related.  
In Zeller et al 2012a, one patient (5.0%) in the GP group experienced a serious AE, generalised tonic-clonic 
seizure activity followed by generalised convulsions, 8 days after the last dose of study drug, which was not 
considered related to study drug; no placebo patient had a serious AE. In Zeller et al 2012b, fourteen 
patients (10%) had 20 serious adverse events, 8 while taking the study drug and 6 within 30 days of the last 
dose. Of these 20 serious adverse events, four were considered treatment-related, ie, nystagmus, 
oesophageal candidiasis, dehydration and gastrointestinal motility disorder. 
The higher incidence of SAE (10 % in Zeller, 2012b vs. 5% in Zeller 2012a) is not surprising as the Zeller 
2012b study was a 24-week study, and the Zeller 2012a study was only an 8-week study. It is not mentioned 
if the serious AEs resolved, in what age group and at what dose level they occurred.  It is noteworthy that in 
the adult study presented in the article by Arbouw, 2010, there were no SAEs. This is of course an indirect 
comparison and should be interpreted with caution, but seems to suggest that incidence the 
severity/seriousness of AEs in adults when treated with GP cannot readily be extrapolated to children with 
neurological disorders. 
Deaths 
There were no reported deaths in any of the pivotal or supportive studies, other than the 24-week open-label 
study by Zeller et al, 2012b.  Three subjects died within 30 days of the last dose of study drug due to SAEs, 
one each due to multisystem organ failure, anoxic encephalopathy, and aspiration pneumonia, but none was 
considered treatment related by the investigators; no additional deaths occurred after 6 months follow-up.

Even if the article mentions that the three deaths were not related to the treatment, only limited information 
is provided. Thus, it is not possible to provide an independent assessment of a causal relationship between 
the deaths and GP treatment. However, the Applicant has provided published literature to support that the 
number of deaths in the Zeller 2012b article does not exceed the expected number of death in this patient 
population. Additionally, the deaths did not occur while the patients were treated with GP.  
Oral solution: Zeller, 2012a and Zeller 2012b 
In Zeller et al 2012a one patient (5.0%) in the GP group experienced a serious AE, generalized tonic-clonic 
seizure activity followed by generalized convulsions, 8 days after the last dose of study drug, which was not 
considered related to study drug; no placebo patient had a serious AE. In Zeller et al 2012b, fourteen 
patients (10%) had 20 serious adverse events, 8 while taking the study drug and 6 within 30 days of the last 
dose. Of these 20 serious adverse events, four were considered treatment-related, ie, nystagmus, 
oesophageal candidiasis, dehydration and gastrointestinal motility disorder. 
Laboratory findings 
There are only laboratory results available from the Zeller 2012b article.  
Haematology: There was an increase in monocytes in approximately 15-10% of the patients. There was a 
decrease in neutrophil count (11% of the patients) and red blood cell count (11% of the patients). There is 
no additional information regarding the degree of changes in the haematological parameters, whether it was 
only a transient change and if there were other possible explanations for the changes, such as infection etc.  
Serum chemistry: There is no information on the extent of the decreases in bicarbonate, carbon dioxide and 
creatinine. There can be several reasons for the observed decrease and it is not known if these are clinically 
relevant. These changes have not been reported as adverse events when glycopyrronium has been used in 
adults in other formulations. 
Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety 
Only the Zeller 2012b article refers to vital signs etc. In the article, it is stated: Although there were minor 
fluctuations in vital signs, including mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, respiration rate, 
temperature, and weight, over the course of the study, none of these changes was clinically notable.  
Considering that treatment is meant for children, it is important to know if there are any adverse effects on 
development including weight, height and neurodevelopment, especially considering that this is a chronic 
treatment. Neurodevelopment may be difficult to assess in a population of patients with neurological 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 74/143 
  
  
 
 
 
disorders. However, weight and height can be monitored. Growth is not even mentioned in the Zeller article, 
so it is impossible to assess any potential effect on growth. Additionally, none of the studies with duration of 
more than 12 months mention growth or weight. 
The Applicant has proposed to reduce the duration of treatment to 24 weeks. This could in theory reduce the 
likelihood of an adverse effect on neurological development and growth. However, even 24 weeks of 
treatment could result in an adverse effect on e.g. neurodevelopment, and repeated courses of treatment are 
not unlikely in a clinical setting.  
Safety in special populations 
Safety results with regard to different age groups within the patient population suggest that younger patients 
experience a higher incidence of adverse events, though there is limited data.  
Safety results in other special populations, such as populations defined by gender, race, renal function and 
hepatic function have not been presented. However, adult studies using other formulation of glycopyrronium 
as well as the PK study conducted with Sialanar does not suggest that gender or race affects the risk of 
adverse event. Additionally, an acceptable dose reduction in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment 
has been included in the product information (see also chapter on pharmacokinetic of this assessment report.  
Intrinsic Factors 
No information is available in the public domain on the interaction between demographic factors and safety of 
GP.  
Safety in paediatric patients 
The Applicant has developed GBOS (0.4 mg/mL) specifically for the treatment of sialorrhoea in children with 
neurological disorders.  The proposed posology is based upon patients weight (and thus, indirectly, age).  
Although younger subjects tended to exhibit AEs more often than older subjects in the study by Mier et al, 
2000, this difference was not statistically significant.  The mean age of subjects who discontinued treatment 
due to AEs was 8 years 7 months, whereas the mean age of subjects who completed the study was 10 years 
11 months, (p=0.015).  An assessment of impact of age upon AE rates was not reported in the studies by 
Zeller et al.  
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
No human reproduction studies have been performed.  However radiolabelled GP was administered to 
patients undergoing a Caesarian section in a study by Ali-Melkkilä et al, 1990b.  In that study, low, clinically 
insignificant, levels of GP were detected in the umbilical venous (0.28 ± 0.25 ng/mL) and in the umbilical 
arterial (0.18 ± 0.11 ng/mL) plasma 86 minutes after administration of a 6 µg/kg i.m. dose.  In another 
study GP 4.4 µg/kg given i.v in 20 term partuants had no effect on foetal heart rate or heart rate variability, 
whereas an increase in maternal heart rate was noted (Abboud, 1981).  A foetal antisialogogue effect cannot 
be ruled out, however the MHRA DAP for glycopyrrolate (period 01-Jul-1963 to 15-Apr-2014) does not 
contain any reports of AEs relating to reproduction or pregnancy (MHRA, 2014b).   
It is not known if GP is excreted in breast milk, although its highly ionized state makes this unlikely (Dollery, 
1998).

As discussed previously, GP can have an effect on temperature homeostasis, which may be exacerbated in 
hot climates. However, no specific labelling is considered necessary. 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
The Applicant notes that congenital hepatic abnormalities are very rare in patients with non-acquired CP 
(Rankin, 2010). The effects of hepatic impairment on the PK of GP have not been investigated. Since the 
predominant route of elimination of GP is renal, a clinically significant change in GP exposure due to hepatic 
impairment is not expected, and therefore a difference in AE profile in this population is considered to be 
unlikely. 
GP is renally eliminated, and renal abnormalities and thus presumably renal impairment occur in children with 
cerebral palsy. It is thus important to know if adverse event occur more frequently and/ or are more severe 
in patients with renal impairment. The Applicant proposed to contraindicate the use of GP in patients with 
severe renal impairment based on a significantly higher exposure in patients with severe renal impairment. 
This is accepted.  
A moderate mean increase in total systemic exposure (AUClast) of up to 1.4 fold was seen in adult subjects 
with mild and moderate renal impairment [estimated GFR greater than or equal to 30 mL/min/1.73m2] and 
up to 2.2 fold in subjects with severe renal impairment end stage renal disease [estimated GFR less than 30 
mL/min/1.73m2] (Sechaud et al., 2102a). Based on extrapolation of results from adult subjects with mild to 
moderate renal impairment, the Applicant proposes a dose reduction of 30% in children with mild or 
moderate renal impairment. Since Sialanar will be titrated based on an assessment of efficacy and side 
effects, the proposal was included into the SmPC. Given the very limited data, also a warning regarding mild 
and moderate renal impairment in the SmPC was added. As GP elimination of GP is largely renal and 
impaired in patients with severe renal impairment, irrespective of the cause the applicant proposed a 
contraindication for these patients to which the CHMP agreed (please refer also to discussion on clinical 
pharmacology of this report). 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Food  
The Applicant has not conducted studies to assess the effect of food on the absorption of GP following 
administration of the proposed product, GBOS 0.4mg/5 mL.  A high-fat meal significantly decreased the 
absorption of a single dose of glycopyrrolate oral solution 2mg in healthy adults. When administered under 
fed conditions, the mean Cmax and AUC∞  were both decreased by ≈75%  compared with fasting conditions; 
median and mean tmax  were not significantly altered.  Glycopyrrolate should therefore be administered ≥ 1 
hour before or ≥2 hours after meals (Garnock-Jones 2012). 
Therefore, the Applicant proposed that dosing of GBOS occurs outside a time window around meals, by 
means of the following wording in the Posology section of the product labelling: 
Dosing should be at least one hour before or two hours after meals. 
Many children with CP and other neurological disorders require feeding via a tube, thus the Applicant’s 
product is likely to be administered via a feeding tube in many cases.  Given the narrow therapeutic margin 
of GP this has implications for the safe use of the product.  The compatibility of the product with 
administration via a feeding tube was assessed in Measure 1 in the Applicant’s Paediatric Investigational Plan 
(PIP), through Protocol CF014-003 (Feeding Tube Study).  The aim of this study was to determine the 
volume of water flushing required in order to clear the feeding tubes of residual product (>99% dose 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 76/143 
  
  
 
 
 
recovery) following administration of the Applicant’s GBOS 2 mg/5 ml.  A minimum volume of 0.5 ml and a 
maximum volume of 7.5 ml of GBOS were tested across a range of feeding tubes.  This volume/dose range is 
equivalent to the lowest initial dose for a child weighing 10-15 kg (minimum dose) and the highest maximum 
tolerable dose for a child weighing >26 kg respectively in the proposed posology.  All feeding tubes assessed 
as part of this study showed complete clearance of the administered dose of GBOS 0.4 mg/mL after the first 
10 mL of flush.   
The recommendation to dose without food likely leads to less PK variability compared to having no 
recommendations or a recommendation to take with food. It is considered to reflects best the clinical data 
obtained with the formulation used in the Zeller studies. Deviations from the recommendation (i.e. taking 
Sialanar with food) would likely lead to increased PK variability and reduce glycopyrronium exposure. Despite 
fact that no food-drug interaction study has been performed with the GBOS formulation, the omission is 
considered acceptable given the above considerations. 
Drug interactions 
The SmPC has been updated to state that concomitant use of Sialanar and potassium chloride solid oral 
doses, topiramate, anticholinergic drugs or antispasmodic drugs should be avoided. Additionally, caution is 
advised with concomitant use of Sialanar and sedating antihistamines, neuroleptics/antipsychotics, skeletal 
muscle relaxants, tricyclic antidepressants, MAOIs, disopyramide, amantadine, nefopam, opioids, digoxin, 
corticosteroids, nitrates, beta-blockers, levodopa or neostigmine. Please also refer to the clinical 
pharmacology section. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Zeller, 2012a: One patient (5%) in the GP and one in the placebo group discontinued due to AE. 
Zeller, 2012b: 10% discontinued due to a treatment related adverse event. The type of AE, age of the child 
and the doses used are unknown. 
Mier, 2000: 18% withdrew due to an AE while treated with GP. The AEs leading to discontinuation were 
typical AEs associated with anticholinergic although behavioral changes were also mentioned. Of the seven 
children who discontinued, four did so before the end of the first week, while they were still receiving the 
lowest dosage level, a mean of 0.04 mg/kg/dose. The other three children discontinued at 10, 28, and 
42 days, respectively while receiving a mean dose of 0.06 mg/kg/dose. 
Blasco et al, 1996: 22.5% discontinued due to AEs. The AEs leading to discontinuation were similar to those 
mentioned in the Mier, 2000 article. There is no information about age and dose.  
Bachrach et al, 1998, 27% discontinued due to AE anywhere from 1 to 20 months.  It is furthermore stated 
in the article that “Of the 11 patients who discontinued glycopyrrolate, three stopped it very quickly (within 2 
months of starting the medication), whereas eight stopped it a year or more after beginning treatment. This 
would seem to indicate that long-term follow-up (of at least 1 year) is essential for an outcome study of 
treatment for drooling. In some of these patients the dose of medication was pushed higher because of lack 
of effect on the drooling, and this then caused side effects that necessitated discontinuing the medication”. 
The dose of those who discontinued was 0.053 mg/kg/dose and was similar to those who continued 
treatment.  Two (5.4%) of the patient who discontinued due to AEs were younger than 2 years. No other 
information is available regarding age and the AEs leading to discontinuation.   
In conclusion, 5-27% discontinued due to an AE. In the two articles reporting the highest discontinuation rate 
due to AE, Blasco et al, 1996 and the Bachrach et al, 1998, the titration scheme, including the increments of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 77/143 
  
  
 
 
the GP dose, was not reported. In the Mier, 2000 article, four (11%) patients withdrew in the first week with 
lowest starting dose (mean dose 0.04 mg/kg/dose). This is twice the recommended starting dose used in the 
Zeller studies and the dose proposed by the Applicant. The lower starting dose in the Zeller studies could 
possibly explain the lower discontinuation rate due to AEs in these studies. This could support the importance 
of choosing a low starting dose and only make small increments in the dose when titrating to the smallest 
effective dose. The two Zeller articles only offer limited information regarding the type of AEs, age of the 
child and the doses used for those who discontinued.  
Post marketing experience 
At time of the submission this substance was not authorised in this indication. Therefore, there are no post-
marketing data available. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Whilst GP has been used for several decades, it has primarily been used in adults, in both acute and chronic 
settings and in formulations different from the oral formulation proposed by the Applicant. The AE profile 
established in other populations cannot readily be applied to a patient population of children with neurological 
disorders, which often have considerable comorbidity. 
The safety data presented in support of this application in children with neurological disorders are derived 
from 6 published articles; Zeller 2012a, Zeller 2012b, Mier 2000, Blasco 1996, Stern 1997 and Bachrach 
1998. The studies presented in the Zeller articles are, in terms of safety, the pivotal studies for this 
application. The supportive articles of GP in adults as well as the Applicants proof of market research, the 
Proveca report as well as the MHRA DAP (Drug Analysis Print) are of little value to conclude on the safety in 
the claimed indication. 
The applicant informed if its intent to provide an oral dosing syringe with an 8 mL measure to accommodate 
the maximum single dose (6 mL). However, the CHMP questions the need for an 8 mL syringe as it may lead 
to an unintentional overdose.  
The most critical shortcoming for this product which is intended to be used long term / chronically from a 
safety point of view is that the safety and tolerability profile in the indication is not appropriately 
characterized. 
The overall size/quantity of the provided safety data is considered small and few patients have been exposed 
in the submitted publications of controlled trials as well as in long-term studies but most importantly the 
information provided are not sufficiently documented. There are not enough details on AEs, and for the 
studies Blasco 1996, Stern 1997 and Bachrach 1998, which provide the long term safety data the information 
provided in the articles is not sufficient to assess if the capture of the AEs was done satisfactorily. 
Only the Zeller, 2012a article describes how many patients were included in the age groups 3-11 (n=12) and 
11-18 (n=7). The development of the children in these categories differs, and thus it is important that the 
safety profile in a sufficient number of patients in each of these age groups can be assessed as the AE profile 
may differ.  
In addition, for the age group 3-11 it is not known how many younger patients were included to ensure 
adequate representation across the age range in this category. This information cannot be retrieved from any 
of the presented articles. Hence, it is not clear if there is a sufficient number of children exposed in each of 
the age groups, and for the age group 3-11 in it not clear if a sufficient number of younger children have 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 78/143 
  
  
 
been exposed to GP. Due to this lack of information, the incidence and severity of AEs by age group, and if 
patients in a certain age group had a higher discontinuation rate and at what dose level patients 
discontinued, cannot be ascertained. 
Only the Zeller 2012a (n=38, 20 patients exposed to GP) article offers safety data from a placebo-controlled 
study where the posology resembles the posology proposed by the Applicant with regards to formulation 
used, initial dose, increments in dose during titration of the dose and recommendations with regards to 
administration with or without food. Oral formulations of GP presumably all have a significant food–drug 
interaction. The other article with placebo-controlled data, Mier 2000 (RCT cross-over study; n=39, 36 
received GP) differs significantly with regards to posology. Thus, only safety data presented in the Zeller 
2012a article can be considered pivotal placebo-controlled safety data. No other data where GP has been 
compared to placebo or active treatment in children have been presented which makes a detailed 
presentation of the safety profile in the remaining articles even more critical also because capturing and 
identifying AEs in children with neurological disorders can be difficult. 
As the proposed treatment is a long-term treatment with chronic exposure, sufficient long-term (6 and 12 
months or longer) safety data are required. The open-label Zeller, 2012b (n=137) study period was 24 
weeks, thus less than 6 months. Only the two open-label studies, Blasco, 1996 (n=38; follow-up 8 months-4 
years) and Stern, 1997 (n=22; duration 5 weeks to 28 moths), as well as the retrospective study Bachrach, 
1998 (n=37; duration not clear though in the range of less than 2 months to more than 20 months), include 
long-term data (12 months or more). However, important details are missing from these articles regarding 
exposure. It is not known how many patients were treated for 6 and 12 months or more, how many patients 
older than 18 years were included, how many patients were in the age groups 2-11 years and 11-18 years 
and how many of these were exposed long-term. Furthermore, it is not known how many patients were 
treated with which dosages long-term, what formulation of GP was used (tablets, oral solution, grounded 
tablets), what dosing schedule was used, how titration was done and if there was any specific instruction 
given concerning the administration with or without food.  
As already mentioned above also the quality of how the AEs were captured is questioned. In the Stern article, 
not enough information was provided on how the AEs were captured. It is only mentioned that “They were 
asked to report possible side-effects or any concerns they had. Close contact was maintained with all the 
participants. Duration of therapy varied from 5 weeks to 28 months. Some time after the end of the trial 
parents were asked to complete a questionnaire in order to assess the effect of glycopyrrolate”.  Only the 
caregiver/parent assessed AEs and it is not known when the AEs were reported. This insufficient way of 
capturing AEs is most likely reflected in the recorded AEs which were: thirst in hot weather in two children, 
dilated pupils in one child, one report of flushed face, constipation in two children, bad breath in one child 
and dry lips in one child . In the Blasco article it is mentioned that there was a regular initial monitoring. It is 
not mentioned how long the monitoring period was. AEs were only assessed by parents/caregivers.  
This way of capturing AES could explain the differences in the incidence of reported AEs (68% did not 
experience any AEs) compared to the Zeller (and Mier) article. In the retrospective study by Bachrach, 
questionnaires were sent to parents/caregivers of children treated with GP at some point. Again, only the 
parent/caregiver assessed any AEs, and there is a risk of significant underreporting.  
These concerns with regard to the quality of the methodology for capturing AEs and missing details on 
exposure of the long-term safety means that the information on AEs observed in the long-term studies 
should be interpreted with extreme caution.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 79/143 
  
  
Additionally, important information is lacking in the Zeller, 2012b article. There is also no information on how 
many children belonged to the age groups ≥ 3 to ≤ 11 and ≥ 12 to ≤ 18 years. The details provided on the 
deaths and serious adverse events are insufficient, and for the 10% who discontinued due to adverse events, 
the type of AE, age of the child and the doses used are unknown. 
In the studies with the best and most thorough way of capturing AEs, the Zeller studies and the Mier study, 
69-100% of the children had an AE. The placebo-controlled trials, Zeller 2012a and Mier 2000, report of an 
incidence of AEs for patients treated with placebo of 89% and 17%, respectively. The observed AEs were 
typical AEs associated with anticholinergics, such as constipation, vomiting, diarrhoea, urinary retention and 
flushing. Of these adverse events, urinary tract dysfunction including retention are frequent symptoms 
associated with cerebral palsy. However, urinary retention was not observed in the placebo group in either of 
the placebo controlled studies but occurred in 13-15% of the patients treated with GP. The high frequency of 
urinary retention with GP constitutes a major concern.  
Pneumonia occurs often in patients with cerebral palsy and was also a frequent adverse event in the Zeller 
2012b study and increased with increasing dose, which suggests a causal relationship to GP. 
Across all studies 5-27% discontinued due to an AE. In the two articles reporting the highest discontinuation 
rate due to AE, Blasco et al, 1996 and the Bachrach et al, 1998, information was not provided on the titration 
schedule, including the dose increments. In the Mier, 2000 trial, four (11%) patients withdrew in the first 
week with the lowest starting dose (mean dose 0.04 mg/kg/dose). This is twice the recommended starting 
dose used in the Zeller studies and the dose proposed by the Applicant. The lower starting dose in the Zeller 
studies could possibly explain the lower discontinuation rate due to AEs. This could support the importance of 
choosing a low starting dose and only make small increments in dose when titrating to the lowest effective 
dose. The two Zeller articles only offer limited information regarding the type of AEs, age of the child and the 
doses used for those who discontinued. This is concerning as the design of these studies are the only studies 
who resemble the proposed posology by the Applicant. 
Adverse events seem to be dose dependent, and the need for careful titration of the dose is confirmed by the 
Zeller articles where 56 up-titrations and 11 down-titrations were made in the Zeller 2012a study and 45% 
had a dose reduction in the Zeller 2012b study. An overall maximum tolerated dose cannot be estimated for 
GP. The maximum tolerated dose is subject to great inter-individual variation as illustrated in the Mier et al 
article, where the range of maximum tolerated dose was 0.04 mg/kg to 0.2 mg/kg.   
Worryingly, considering the claim that GP does not cross the blood brain barrier, the Mier article reports that 
23% of the children treated with GP had behavioural changes. The Blasco article mentions that 13% had 
behavioural changes while none of the other article mentions this AE as a frequent AE. This is not sufficiently 
addressed because a study in children with hydrocephalus showed that in some children GP crosses the blood 
brain barrier. Drowsiness, confusion, somnolence have been reported as adverse effects of GP. Since the 
patients with CP may suffer from fluctuating daily living capacity or may also suffer from various mental 
disorders, these neurological adverse effects are likely to be completely unrecognized or under-reported in 
the clinical studies. Decrease of daily activities/quality of life may be a negative consequence of these 
adverse events.  
Considering that this is a chronic treatment meant for children, it is important to know if there are any 
adverse effects on development including weight, height and neurodevelopment. Neurodevelopment may be 
difficult to assess in a population of patients with neurological disorders. However, weight and height can be 
monitored. The Applicant mentions that no adverse effect on growth was reported. However, growth is not 
even mentioned in the Zeller articles, so it impossible to assess any potential effect on growth. Additionally, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 80/143 
  
  
none of the studies with a duration of more than 12 months mentions growth or weight. Even with the 
proposed reduced duration of treatment adverse effect on neurological development and growth may occur. 
Additionally, it is not unlikely that the child would receive more than one 24-week treatment courses. GP, as 
an anticholinergic, is expected to increase the heart rate (HR). There is no information in any of the articles 
on HR increases with GP treatment in children with neurological disorders. Additionally, there is insufficient 
information regarding effects on blood pressure. The only article mentioning ECG results is Zeller, 2012b, 
where it is stated that there was no abnormal or clinically significant shifts in ECG findings in subjects who 
had had an ECG at baseline and at week 24. However, the number of patients with baseline and week 24 
ECG recordings is not stated. In addition, there is insufficient information regarding the ECG results to allow 
an independent review. Further, a thorough QTc study with an active (QTc prolonging) reference has not 
been conducted. However, extrapolation of the plasma concentrations in a QT study with inhaled GP suggests 
that the plasma concentration measured in study PRO/GLY/001 in healthy adults are similar and as such 
Sialanar does not cause QT prolongation at those plasma concentrations. Sialanar simulated plasma 
concentrations in 3 year old children are comparable to the plasma concentrations in the QT interval study 
with inhaled GP. 
The Applicant provided data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), an English NHS 
observational data and interventional research service. 
Tabulations of undesired events by System Organ Class (SOC) and MedRA Preferred Term (PT) for the cohort 
of 428 children treated or likely treated for pathological drooling were presented. Events occurring 
throughout the child’s life and during treatment plus the period shortly after treatment were tabulated 
separately. Some of the events are typical of a population of otherwise healthy children and adolescents, 
some typical of children or adolescents with neurological disabilities. It is acknowledged that some of the 
events that may be adverse effects of glycopyrronium also are seen in untreated patients. 
The Applicant has also shown, based on the CPRD database, that a large proportion of the patients have been 
treated with glycopyrronium for more than 6 months and presented a tabulation of the most common 
adverse events for the cohort of 428 children treated or likely treated for pathological drooling by two age 
groups: < 12 years and 12-17 years. 
A discussion for each of the areas of particular concern (heart rate and blood pressure, pneumonia and 
urinary retention) as well as other events (e.g. malignancies) was provided and the numbers of events in the 
cohort are generally low and the events are also seen when patients are not treated with glycopyrronium. 
However, it is difficult to extract meaningful and pivotal information about the safety and tolerability profile of 
glycopyrronium from the CPRD database. Whilst this database provides valuable information, adverse events 
are not captured with the same rigor as in a randomised clinical trial or even an open-label clinical trial. This 
concern is supported by the fact that a number of events clearly identified as adverse effects of 
glycopyrronium from the randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trials, such as urinary retention (incidence 
on glycopyrronium about 13-15% vs. 0% on placebo), were reported with a substantially lower frequency in 
the database. It should be noted that these discrepancies are seen despite the fact that the average exposure 
per patient in the CPRD database was much higher than in the two placebo-controlled studies (Zeller, 2012a 
and Mier, 2000). 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
In view of the uncertainties linked to the different posologies applied in the submitted literature, the overall 
size/quantity of the provided safety data, the quality of how AE were captured and insufficient details 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 81/143 
  
  
provided on the patients exposed in controlled trials as well as in long-term studies, the clinical safety profile 
in children with neurological disorders is not adequately characterized 
It is uncertain if the plasma concentrations of Sialanar in children and adolescents with neurological disorder 
could cause clinically relevant effects on blood pressure and heart rate. Hence, there is uncertainty about the 
cardiovascular safety of GP in this patient group. Urinary retention was reported with an incidence of 13-15% 
in the pivotal clinical studies whereas not occurring in the placebo arm and also pneumonia appears to be 
associated with GP use and there is insufficient information on the severity of these adverse events. 
Also CNS effects have been reported with GP, and their significance in children with neurological disorders is 
associated with uncertainty. Additionally, there is no information on neurodevelopment or growth (height and 
weight) which may be affected particularly when treatment is applied chronically or in repeated episodes.  
Furthermore it is unknown if the safety profile differs in different age groups. The provided data from a UK 
database (CPRD) are of observational nature, and adverse events from this database are unlikely to be 
captured with the same rigor as in a clinical trial. Hence, safety and tolerability data from this database 
cannot compensate for the deficient data package from clinical trials. 
The Applicant proposed to limit the treatment duration to 24 weeks based on the data from the Zeller 2012b 
article.  Reducing the duration of treatment could in theory reduce the risk of adverse developmental effects, 
but many patients will presumably be treated for several individual treatment episodes in view of the 
chronicity of the underlying conditions.  
Furthermore uncertainties on the clinical importance of cardiovascular and CNS effects, urinary retention and 
the insufficiently characterized safety profile remain therefore does not allow for putting appropriate risk 
mitigation in place. 
In view of the above it needs to be considered that a marketing authorisation application under Article 10a of 
Directive 2001/83/EC must demonstrate that the use of the substance in the relevant indication has been in 
well-established medicinal use in the European Union for at least 10 years, with a recognised efficacy and an 
acceptable level of safety. The lack of sufficient and reliable qualitative and quantitative data and subsequent 
resulting uncertainties do not allow establishing that glycopyrronium bromide has been used in the European 
Union for the symptomatic treatment of siallorrhea (chronic pathological drooling) in children  and 
adolescents aged 3 to <18 years with neurological disorders with an acceptable level of safety. The 
application falls therefore short of demonstrating that the requirements of Article 10a of Directive 
2001/83/EC are fulfilled. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
Due to the aforementioned concerns a satisfactory pharmacovigilance system cannot be agreed at this stage. 
2.8.  Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC provided some comments on version 1.2 as described in the PRAC endorsed PRAC Rapporteur 
assessment report (appended).  
The company implemented the changes as requested. The PRAC rapporteur considered that the RMP version

1.3, which includes the agreed educational materials for healthcare professionals and patient carers to 
minimise and manage common anticholinergic side effects and prevent the risk of dosing errors and 
overdose, could be acceptable provided that the benefit/risk balance of this medicinal product is favourable.  
The CHMP took note of the Risk Management Plan version 1.3 with the following content but in view of the 
aforementioned concerns a satisfactory risk management plan cannot be agreed at this stage.

to ensure an accurate dose is given each time, in order 
to prevent the harmful consequences of anticholinergic 
reactions of glycopyrronium bromide seen with dosing

manifestations are caused by CNS effects, peripheral 
nervous system effects, or both. Common 
manifestations include flushing, dry skin and mucous

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The benefit of glycopyrronium in alleviating pathological drooling in children with neurological disorders has 
been demonstrated in two randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trials: The Zeller, 2012a study and the 
Mier, 2000 study. Both studies were short-term as the treatment duration was 8 weeks. 
The pivotal 8-week study in Zeller at al. 2012a conducted with thirty-eight patients demonstrated superiority 
of glycopyrrolate over placebo in reduction of drooling in children 3-16 years old: 
The initial dose was 0.02 mg/kg, which was increased in 0.02 m g/kg increments every 5 to 7 days up to a 
maximum dose of 0.1 mg/kg (but not to exceed a maximum dose of 3 mg t.i.d, regardless of weight). The 
responder rate at Week 8 (≥ 3 point improvement on the mTDS) was significantly higher for glycopyrrolate 
(14/19; 73.7%) than for placebo (3/17; 17.6%) (p = 0.0011), with improvements starting 2 weeks after 
treatment initiation (52.6% vs. 0%; p=0.00007). The favourable effects of GP on the mTDS were 
corroborated by results of investigator and patient/caregiver rated global assessments. Due to differences in 
relative bioavailability between Sialanar (approximately 25% higher bioaviliablility) and the product used in 
this trial the proposed titration scheme for Sialanar was adapted during the procedure to largely mirror 
exposure levels obtained during titration in this trial. 
Also the study by Mier et al. conducted in thirty-nine children aged 4 years and older with 
neurodevelopmental conditions and severe sialorrhoea demonstrated superiority of glycopyrrolate over 
placebo. Doses were increased in 0.6 mg increments in both groups but from different starting doses: 0.6 to 
2.4 mg in the lower weight group and 1.2 to 3.0 mg in the higher weight group. Drooling score on the mTDS 
improved in a linear manner with increasing dose level over the 4-week titration period; scores were 6.0 at 
dose level 1, 4.5 at level 2, 3.6 at level 3, and 2.6 at level 4. After an additional 4 weeks at the highest 
individual dose the mean drooling score had decreased further to 2.3. 
These two randomised, double-blind studies are supported by a long-term safety study by Zeller at al. 
2012b. In this 24-week, open-label study glycopyrrolate was administered to 137 paediatric patients between 
3-18 years of age. At Week 24, 52.3% (95% CI 43.7–60.9) of subjects were responders (≥ 3 point reduction 
on the mTDS). The proportion of responders ranged between 40.3% and 56.7% over the 6 assessment 
points during the 24 week study period.

Page 88/143 
  
  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
General uncertainties on the beneficial effects are deriving from the study design and the analysis/reporting 
of both the Zeller 2012a study and, in particular, the Mier study. Issues relate to the overall study design, 
blinding, enrichment of study population, population of analysis, imputation method for missing data, 
reporting of results by age group as well as other aspects which could not be clarified in the context of this 
bibliographic application. The main efficacy studies were performed with other formulations of GP than 
Sialanar. The higher bioavailability of Sialanar compared to the product used in the pivotal Zeller studies 
(Zeller 2012a and Zeller 2012b) was addressed by revising the titration schedule for Sialanar, addressing the 
concern on the uncertainty on the applicability of the pivotal data to Sialanar.  
The two placebo-controlled studies only investigated efficacy in the short-term and although the open-label 
study Zeller 2012b offers some reassurance about maintenance of the effect over 24 weeks maintenance of 
efficacy for long term or chronic use could not be substantiated by the available data. The applicant revised 
the treatment duration during the procedure to a maximum treatment duration of 24 weeks considering the 
available efficacy data however the treatment is aimed for a chronic condition. 
Also in view of the side effects of glycopyrronium, uncertainty remains regarding the overall effect on quality 
of life (QoL) in this patient group since no data on QoL specific to this treatment and patient population have 
been presented. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Most of the adverse events that occurred more frequently in patients treated with GP than in patients on 
placebo were typical anticholinergic effects. They included dry mouth/excessive dryness of mouth or 
secretions, constipation, vomiting, nasal congestion, flushing, behavioural changes, urinary retention and 
diarrhoea. Overall these events occurred quite frequently in GP treated patient with frequencies ranging from 
10 to 40%.  
The Mier article reports that 23% of the children treated with GP had behavioural changes. The Blasco article 
mentions that 13% had behavioural changes while none of the other article mentions this AE as a frequent 
AE. Further a study in children with hydrocephalus showed that in some children GP crosses the blood brain 
barrier. Furthermore drowsiness, confusion, somnolence have been reported as adverse effects of GP. 
Urinary tract dysfunction including retention are frequent symptoms associated with cerebral palsy. However, 
urinary retention was not observed in the placebo group in either of the placebo controlled studies but 
occurred in 13-15% of the patients treated with GP. The high frequency of urinary retention with GP 
constitutes a major concern. 
Pneumonia occurs often in patients with cerebral palsy and was also a frequent adverse event in the Zeller 
2012b study and increased with increasing dose, which suggests a causal relationship to GP. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
After detailed assessment of the submitted safety data the overall safety and tolerability profile of GP is still 
associated with significant uncertainties. Insufficient details are provided on the exposed patients to  
compensate for the small number of patients included in the submitted publications on controlled trials as 
well as in long-term studies.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 89/143 
  
  
In the submitted articles GP has primarily been used in adults and in the paediatric populations as surgery 
premedication and in the adult population also for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease but 
in different formulations and not as an oral solution. The AE profile established in other populations cannot 
readily be extrapolated to a patient population of children with neurological disorders which often have 
considerable comorbidity. Furthermore only single administrations were used with premedication. In contrast, 
long-term use is expected with Sialanar. 
Only the Zeller 2012a (n=38, 20 patients exposed to GP) article offers safety data from a placebo-controlled 
study where the posology resembles the posology proposed by the Applicant with regard to formulation used, 
initial dose, increments in dose during titration of the dose and recommendations with regards to 
administration with or without food. 
Information derived from the submitted literature and in particular from the pivotal safety studies is 
insufficient to conclude on an acceptable safety profile.  
It could not be clarified by the applicant if a sufficient number of children in each of the age groups, and in 
particular within the age group 3-11 have been exposed to GP. This is considered an important uncertainty as 
the development of children by age category differs. There is no information on neurodevelopment or growth 
(height and weight). 
Furthermore, there is no information regarding the incidence and severity of AE by age group, and if patients 
in a certain age group had a higher discontinuation rate and at what dose level patients discontinued. As 
capturing and identifying AEs in children with neurological disorders can be difficult, it is even more important 
to have a sufficient database size and details on the exposed patients. 
In the absence of robust clinical safety data, also the non-clinical data cannot provide sufficient assurance on 
repeat-use toxicology, reproductive/developmental toxicology, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity. Extrapolation 
of safety margins to the proposed population are not considered adequate due to lack of toxicokinetic 
exposure data. 
GP, as any anticholinergic, is expected to have cardiac effects. Insufficient information has been provided on 
pulse rate and blood pressure. Hence, there is uncertainty about the cardiovascular safety of GP in this 
patient group. Urinary retention was reported with an incidence of 13-15% in the pivotal clinical studies 
whereas not occurring in the placebo arm and also pneumonia appears to be associated with GP use and 
there is insufficient information on the severity of these adverse events. 
The Sialanar formulation is more bioavailable than the formulation used in the Zeller studies being pivotal for 
clinical safety. Even though the titration schedule was amended taking into account the higher bioavailability 
of the Sialanar formulation the generally high PK variability makes it uncertain to what extent the titration 
and dosing schedule used in the Zeller studies can be safely applied on the use of Sialanar. However, the 
recommended initial dose and dose titration schedule has been revised taking into account the higher 
bioavailability of the Sialanar formulation. This uncertainty has therefore been reduced significantly. 
Also pneumonia appears to be associated with GP use and there is uncertainty about its clinical significance in 
children. Furthermore and the clinical significance of the reported CNS effects with GP, in children with 
neurological disorders is associated with uncertainty.  
There are no data on adverse events from placebo-controlled trials with treatment duration longer than 8 
weeks and the Applicant has proposed to limit the treatment duration to 24 weeks based on the data from 
the Zeller 2012b article. Reducing the duration of treatment could in theory reduce the risk of adverse

developmental effects, but many patients will presumably be treated for several individual treatment 
episodes in view of the chronicity of the underlying conditions.  
Furthermore uncertainties on the clinical importance of cardiovascular and CNS effects, urinary retention and 
the insufficiently characterized safety profile remain and reducing the duration of treatment does not 
sufficiently address these above concerns.

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Alternative treatment options, non-pharmacological and pharmacological, for sialorrhoea are limited and at 
present there is insufficient evidence to be able to distinguish between these different approaches, though it 
is clear that none of them is completely successful in all individuals. Possible detrimental effects of 
uncontrolled drooling include irritated and macerated skin, dehydration and lowering of self-esteem. The 
favourable effects of GP on pathological drooling in children with neurological disorders are considered 
possibly clinically relevant. 
The lack of selectivity of anticholinergics can lead to widespread, undesirable, and often poorly tolerated 
central and peripheral effects, including restlessness, irritability, drowsiness, constipation, urinary retention, 
and flushing. Chronic urinary retention can lead to damage to the bladder by overextension. Additionally, 
there is a risk of reflux leading to tubular atrophy and, eventually, irreversible renal injury.  
Since the patients with CP may suffer from fluctuating daily living capacity or may also suffer from various 
mental disorders, neurological adverse effects are likely to be completely unrecognized or under-reported in 
the clinical studies. Decrease of daily activities/quality of life may be a negative consequence of these 
adverse events.

Benefit-risk balance 
The efficacy of Sialanar in alleviating pathological drooling in children with neurological disorders need to be 
weighed against many and significant uncertainties in terms of safety due to the lack of appropriate data on 
safety and tolerability profile. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Taken together, submitted data supports short term efficacy on pathological drooling in patients as of the age 
of three years. Although the open-label study Zeller 2012b offered some reassurance about maintenance of 
the effect, the two placebo-controlled studies only investigated efficacy in the short-term. None of the studies 
supported chronic use of GP in paediatric subjects with sialorrhoea from a clinical efficacy perspective and the 
indication was revised during the procedure to a maximum treatment duration of 24 weeks considering the 
available efficacy data. 
The overall safety and tolerability profile of Sialanar in the claimed indication comprising chronic use in 
neurologically impaired paediatric patients is associated with significant uncertainties due to the lack of 
appropriate data leading to an insufficient characterisation of the safety profile. 
There are insufficient details in the submitted literature including controlled trials as well as long-term studies 
to draw reliable conclusions on safety for the claimed indication. Furthermore the number of patients exposed 
in the claimed indication is limited. Due to the absence of data in patients younger than three years the 
earliest age for treatment in the indication was increased from 2 to 3 years during the procedure but an 
insufficient characterisation of the safety profile by age group in the remaining age subsets remains (i.e. in 
the age groups 3-11 and 12-18 years).  
It is uncertain if the plasma concentrations of Sialanar in children and adolescents with neurological disorder 
could cause clinically relevant effects on blood pressure and heart rate. There is no information in any of the 
articles on HR increases with GP treatment in children with neurological disorders. Additionally, there is 
insufficient information regarding effects on blood pressure. Hence, there is uncertainty about the 
cardiovascular safety of GP in this patient group.  
Urinary retention was reported with an incidence of 13-15% with GP in randomized controlled clinical studies 
whereas not occurring in the placebo arm and there was no information provided on the severity of the 
episodes of urinary retention nor if it was associated with an increased incidence of urinary tract infections. 
Also pneumonia appears to be associated with GP use and there is insufficient information on the severity of 
these adverse events. 
CNS effects have been reported with GP, and their significance in children with neurological disorders is 
associated with uncertainty. Additionally, there is no information on neurodevelopment or growth (height and 
weight) which may be affected particularly when treatment is applied chronically or in repeated episodes.  
Reducing the duration of treatment is considered not to sufficiently address the above safety concerns as 
many patients will presumably be treated for several individual treatment episodes in view of the chronicity 
of the underlying conditions.  
Although the condition can be very unpleasant for the affected children and their parents and caregivers, it is 
not fatal or severely debilitating. While some of the unfavourable effects – as they are currently known – 
might be clinically manageable, significant uncertainties remain with regard to important unfavourable 
effects, in particular per age group which may remain unknown and / or not being known in their severity. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 93/143 
  
  
Furthermore and in view of the above uncertainties on side effects, it could not be demonstrated by the 
applicant if the effect of the treatment – decrease of drooling – provides improvement in the quality of life of 
the patients comprised in the claimed indication. 
Finally a marketing authorisation application under Article 10a of Directive 2001/83/EC must demonstrate 
that the use of the substance in the relevant indication has been in well-established medicinal use in the 
European Union for at least 10 years, with a recognised efficacy and an acceptable level of safety. The lack of 
sufficient and reliable qualitative and quantitative data and subsequent resulting uncertainties do not allow 
establishing that glycopyrronium bromide has been used in the European Union for the symptomatic 
treatment of siallorrhea (chronic pathological drooling) in children  and adolescents aged 3 to <18 years with 
neurological disorders with an acceptable level of safety. The application falls therefore short of 
demonstrating that the requirements of Article 10a of Directive 2001/83/EC are fulfilled. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy for Sialanar in the treatment of sialorrhoea 
(chronic pathological drooling) in children aged 3 to <18 years with neurological disorders the CHMP 
considers by consensus that the safety of the above mentioned medicinal product is not sufficiently 
demonstrated, and, therefore recommends the refusal of the granting of the Marketing Authorisation for the 
above mentioned medicinal product. The CHMP considers that: 
Whereas 
• 
The overall safety and tolerability profile of Sialanar in the symptomatic treatment of sialorrhoea 
(chronic pathological drooling) in children and adolescents aged 3 to <18 years with neurological 
disorders is not appropriately characterised. There are significant safety concerns due to the aimed 
chronic use of Sialanar in the paediatric population affected by the underlying conditions, in particular 
on the risks of cardiovascular effect, developmental effects, urinary retention and CNS effects. These 
uncertainties are a major concern in view of the target population, which cannot be addressed 
adequately by a reduction of the duration of treatment due to the chronicity of the underlying conditions 
or by warnings and precaution statements in the Product Information. 
• 
The lack of adequate non-clinical data in support of the claimed indication does not provide sufficient 
assurance on repeat-use toxicology, reproductive/developmental toxicology, genotoxicity and 
carcinogenicity. Extrapolation of safety margins to the proposed population are not considered adequate 
due to lack of toxicokinetic exposure data; 
•  A marketing authorisation application submitted under Article 10a of Directive 2001/83/EC must 
demonstrate that the use of the substance in the relevant indication has been in well-established 
medicinal use for at least 10 years in the European Union, with a recognised efficacy and an acceptable 
level of safety. The lack of sufficient and reliable qualitative and quantitative data and subsequent 
resulting uncertainties do not allow to establish that glycopyrronium bromide has been used in the 
European Union for the symptomatic treatment of sialorrhoea (chronic pathological drooling) in children 
and adolescents aged 3 to <18 years with neurological disorders with an acceptable level of safety. The 
application falls therefore short of demonstrating that the requirements of Article 10a of Directive 
2001/83/EC are fulfilled;

•  Having considered above the safety profile, it has also not been demonstrated that Sialanar is 
associated with any improvement in the quality of life in the claimed indication.  
the CHMP is of the opinion that pursuant to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the safety of the 
above mentioned product is not sufficiently characterized and does not outweigh the benefit for the 
symptomatic treatment of sialorrhoea (chronic pathological drooling) in children and adolescents aged 3 to 
<18 years with neurological disorders. The CHMP therefore considers that the overall benefit/risk balance is 
unfavorable and recommends the refusal of the granting of the marketing authorization for Sialanar. 
Due to the aforementioned concerns a satisfactory summary of product characteristics, labelling, package 
leaflet, cannot be agreed at this stage.

5.  Re-examination of the CHMP opinion of 28 April 2016 
Following the CHMP conclusion that Sialanar was not approvable as the safety of the above mentioned 
medicinal product is not sufficiently demonstrated; the applicant submitted detailed grounds for the re-
examination of the grounds for refusal.  
Detailed grounds for re-examination submitted by the applicant 
The applicant presented their detailed grounds in writing and at an oral explanation. A summary of the 
applicant´s grounds for re-examination is presented below. 
Ground #1 
• 
The overall safety and tolerability profile of Sialanar in the symptomatic treatment of sialorrhoea 
(chronic pathological drooling) in children and adolescents aged 3 to <18 years with neurological 
disorders is not appropriately characterised. There are significant safety concerns due to the aimed 
chronic use of Sialanar in the paediatric population affected by the underlying conditions, in particular 
on the risks of cardiovascular effect, developmental effects, urinary retention and CNS effects. These 
uncertainties are a major concern in view of the target population, which cannot be addressed 
adequately by a reduction of the duration of treatment due to the chronicity of the underlying conditions 
or by warnings and precaution statements in the Product Information.  
Applicant’s grounds for re-examination: Point 1 
The CHMP have concerns over the lack of full characterisation of the overall safety and tolerability profile of 
Sialanar in the symptomatic treatment of sialorrhoea in children and adolescents aged 3 to <18 years with 
neurological disorders. The specific safety concerns result from the aimed chronic use of Sialanar in the 
paediatric population affected by the underlying conditions, in particular on the risks of cardiovascular effect, 
developmental effects, urinary retention and CNS effects. These uncertainties are a major concern to CHMP in 
view of the target population, and they are of the belief that the concerns cannot be addressed adequately by 
a reduction in the duration of treatment due to the chronicity of the underlying conditions or by warnings and 
precaution statements in the Product Information. This document collates and discusses the data contained in 
the PUMA Application for each of the outstanding areas with the aim of providing the necessary information 
to justify the presence of adequate safety information for each of the specific points of concern. The Applicant 
believes that the data from controlled and open clinical studies, supported by an extensive dataset from 
CPRD (the world’s largest database of real-life patient data including histories, diagnoses and drug 
treatments) provides unequivocal proof of the safety of GP in the target population and justifies a positive 
opinion on the licence application. Safety overview Safety data is covered in detail in m2.5.5, which should be 
read in conjunction with this document. The data show that the majority of the AEs occurring more frequently 
in patients treated with GP than in patients on placebo, were typical anticholinergic effects. They included dry 
mouth, constipation, vomiting, nasal congestion, flushing, behavioural changes, urinary retention and 
diarrhoea. These events occurred with frequencies ranging from 10 to 40% in the GP group.  
For most of the events, a difference from placebo was observed in both placebo controlled studies (Zeller, 
2012a and Mier, 2000). However, an excess incidence of behavioural changes and diarrhoea in the GP group 
was reported only in the Mier study. There are no data on adverse events from placebo-controlled trials with 
treatment duration longer than 8 weeks. The DRI study compared 2 active drugs (GP and hyoscine) over a 
period of 12 weeks and confirms the known safety profile plus an improved tolerability of GP over hyoscine 
(Parr, 2016).

Page 96/143 
  
  
 
Treatment emergent AEs have been extensively examined from the data in CPRD and are discussed in detail 
in m2.5.5.3 with the majority of treatment episodes lasting less than 6 months. Comparing AEs in the treated 
population versus the full cohort, the most common infections were of the respiratory tract (381/2739) with 
urinary tract infections accounting for 33/219 events. The most common GI events were constipation 
(72/450) and vomiting (67/392). The most common events for respiratory, nervous, general and skin are 
cough (228/1542), epilepsy (80/536), pyrexia (27/247) and rash (58/392). The events and their frequencies 
are entirely consistent with those seen both in this population and in relation to use of GP in the clinical trials.  
Occurrence of AEs is dose-related, hence the need to apply a dose titration scheme as proposed by the 
Applicant and used in current clinical practice. The dose titration is based on the patient’s efficacy response 
balanced against the occurrence of adverse events. The adverse events are well-known anticholinergic 
effects, which can all be assessed by the caregiver in discussion with the prescriber and the PIL contains 
detailed instructions on what undesirable effects to look for and how to manage them.  
Contraindications to use are, hypersensitivity to GP or any of the excipients, use in children below the age of 
3 years, glaucoma, severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73m2), including those with end-stage 
renal disease requiring dialysis, history of intestinal obstruction, diarrhoea, ulcerative colitis, paralytic ileus, 
pyloric stenosis, myasthenia gravis, pregnant or lactating women. In addition, the following drugs must not 
be co-administered with glycopyrronium; potassium chloride solid oral dose, topiramate, anticholinergic and 
antispasmodic drugs. Patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (eGFR >30 ml/min/1.73m2) will be 
given a 30% dose reduction.  
Products containing the active ingredient have been licensed in Europe for many decades. Pharmacovigilance 
data have not revealed any special safety concerns associated with use of GP during that period, including its 
long-term use in ‘special’ preparations for the treatment of sialorrhoea. 
Safety information on areas of concern to CHMP  
Chronic use  
Duration of GP treatment in the placebo-controlled trials (Zeller et al, 2012a, Mier et al, 2000) was 8 weeks 
and in the comparator controlled trial (Parr, 2016), 12 weeks. Exposure in the open-label study (Zeller et al, 
2012b) was 24 weeks. All studies used a slow dose titration scheme based on the body weight of the child. 
The clinical data support the safety in this population up to 24 weeks. However, it is clear that GP will be 
used in a proportion of patients for longer than the 24-week period covered by the clinical data. Therefore, 
given the lack of safety data beyond 24 weeks, the Applicant has conducted a detailed assessment of safety 
information available in the CPRD database, to understand the clinical history of children with sialorrhoea 
treated with GP (m2.5.5.6). The purpose of the CPRD study was to assess all children in the database who 
had a prescription for GP and/or a diagnosis of drooling, resulting in a final dataset of 3,672 children. Analysis 
of the data showed:  
• The vast majority of patients, 2,512 (68.5%), received no treatment associated with a drooling diagnosis.  
• 428 (82%) of the 521 patients who received at least one prescription for GP were being treated for 
sialorrhoea.  
• Using a gap in treatment episodes of 45 days, 152 (35.7%) patients had a single treatment episode, 345 
(81%) had up to 6 separate treatment episodes, 48 (11.3%) had between 7 and 12 separate episodes with 
the remainder having between 13 and 49 separate treatment episodes.  
• The mean duration of all treatment episodes was 4.8 months ranging from 2 to 92 months.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 97/143 
  
  
• The cohort of 428 patients treated with GP for sialorrhoea provided information on a population equivalent 
to 26,089 children age 3-17 years covering 24,684 patient-years.  
• Within this period, children received treatment with GP for an equivalent of 435 patient-years.  
• In total 1,797 treatment episodes occurred of which 1,565 (87.1%) lasted up to 6 months with a further 
170 (9.5%) lasting from 7 to 18 months. The remaining 62 (3.4%) treatment episodes ranged from 19 to 92 
months.  
The data from the CPRD allows meaningful calculations for the effect of treatment duration on the more 
common AEs relating to respiratory infection, cough, pneumonia and constipation. Weighting is used to 
compare AE incidence with the number of months into a GP treatment that a particular AE occurred, thus 
counterbalancing the decrease in the number of treatment windows that remain open as time goes on. As 
such, the incidence figures presented do not represent the actual number of treatment windows that remain 
open as time goes on. As such, the incidence figures presented do not represent the actual number of 
incidences of AEs from month 2 onwards. However the weighting allows trends to be observed in the figures 
that would otherwise be invisible. As the number of open windows decreases, the number of AE incidences 
will fall, but as the weighting factors are inversely proportional to the AE decrease. The weighted incidence 
figures would remain flat where the duration of GP treatment has no influence on incidence of AEs. Therefore 
trend lines drawn over a graph of the AE incidences can show whether GP use has a positive, negative or 
neutral effect on the incidence rates of particular adverse events. Analysis of the data shows that in the 
weighted AE trends in patients treated with GP for sialorrhoea, as treatment duration increases, the incidence 
of the more commonly occurring AEs, respiratory infection, cough, pneumonia and constipation decreases 
Figure below (a-d), presented for 18 months treatment duration. This is true for all treatment durations 
although the low numbers beyond 18 months do not allow accurate calculations due to a high likelihood of 
sampling error. This evidence builds on the safety data, up to 6 months, available from clinical studies and 
provides confidence that longer treatment duration, beyond 6 months, does not result in an increased 
incidence of AEs.

 The data for diarrhoea Figure 1 (e) shows a marginal increase in incidence with time, but since this is based 
on a single event at treatment-month 18 (with no episodes of diarrhoea between 12 and 18 months) it is 
highly likely to be a result of sampling error. Reducing the weighting (from 2 to 1 event) reverses the line to 
show a decrease in incidence of diarrhoea over time. Trends in AEs for CV and urinary retention are not 
presented since the very small numbers of events dramatically increases the chance of sampling errors. The 
data from the CPRD shows that the vast majority of children (87.1%) have treatment episodes lasting up to 6 
months (m2.5.5.2). The evidence from CPRD showing a decline in the incidence of common AEs with time in 
this population provides comprehensive support for the safe use of GP for periods longer than 6 months. As 
such, there is no justification for inclusion of a maximum 6-month treatment duration in the SmPC. As 
pointed out by the CHMP and shown in CPRD, a small proportion of children are currently, and will continue 
to be, treated for periods longer than 6 months. The available evidence provides reassurance that this is a 
safe practice where there is a clinical need and the benefit/risk ratio is positive.  
Age  
Module 2.5.5.9 discusses the effects of age on the incidence of AEs in detail. The unfavourable effects seen 
with GP in the target population are consistently seen as those relating to an effect on anticholinergic 
receptors. Information in the published clinical studies does not allow an interpretation of any differences in 
AEs in younger versus older children. Nevertheless, there are a significantly greater proportion of younger 
children across all studies and hence the majority of the available safety data is on younger children. 
Therefore the clinical study data is highly representative of the younger population. The data in the CPRD 
have been examined to assess the effect of age on incidence of AEs. CPRD supports the known position that 
AEs per se are more common in younger children compared to older children, whether or not they are on 
treatment with GP. The data from this extensive, real-life database demonstrates that in the treated 
population pneumonia and constipation have a greater incidence of AEs in younger versus older children with 
a somewhat smaller increase between the two age ranges for respiratory infection, cough and diarrhoea 
(m2.5, Table 22). The number of occurrences of urinary retention and cardiac events in CPRD are extremely 
low and as such reliable conclusions cannot be drawn. If taken on face value the data may indicate an 
increase in urinary retention in the treated older child versus the younger child and for cardiac events could 
indicate an increase in events in the older child versus the younger child whether treated with GP or not, but 
given the low numbers this cannot be confirmed. 
The known difference in AEs in younger versus older children per se, is borne out by the available data from 
CPRD, however the safety profile from clinical studies, as reflected in the SmPC, provides information from all 
data sources with a default to the use of higher figures where the information is conflicting. The wording in 
the SmPC captures any difference in AE potential between the age groups and is deemed appropriate 
information for the prescriber. The SmPC states, “Younger children may be more susceptible to adverse 
events and this should be borne in mind when any dose adjustments are carried out.” 
Cardiovascular system 
Module 2.5.3.9.3.1 discusses the CV pharmacodynamic effects of GP in detail. The CV effects of 
anticholinergic drugs are well understood and the effects of GP have been comprehensively investigated 
(changes in HR, BP and cardiac rhythm) in a series of studies in paediatric and adult populations 
(m2.7.2.2.2). The plasma concentration of GP required for effective vagolysis has been determined to be at 
least 10 μg/L. In studies in children by Rautokorpi et al, 1994 and Rautokorpi et al, 1998 plasma 
concentrations following a 5 μg/kg i.v. dose of GP only briefly exceeded this concentration immediately 
following administration (m2.7.2, Figure 1). Conversely they never exceeded ~0.3 μg/L following a 50 μg/kg 
oral dose (m2.7.2, Figure 2). Significant changes from baseline in HR were not seen in any paediatric age 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 101/143 
  
  
group in either study (m2.7.2, Figure 17). In addition no changes in BP were observed after GP by either 
route of administration (m2.7.2, Figure 18). Evidence suggests that at the low plasma concentrations of GP 
likely after oral administration modest and generally clinically insignificant decreases in HR may be observed 
(m2.7.2, Figure 27). Conversely, since induction of a vagolytic effect requires a plasma concentration of 10 
μg/L, this is unlikely to be a significant issue for most patients. In study PRO/GLY/001, the maximum plasma 
concentration after 2 mg (~0.03 mg/kg) GBOS in adult volunteers occurred between 3 and 7 hours post 
dose, reaching a maxima of ~1000 pg/mL (i.e. 1 μg/L); half that following a corresponding dose of Cuvposa 
(m2.7.2 Figure 6). The highest dose of GBOS (0.1 mg/kg) in the Applicant’s proposed posology is 3.3 fold 
higher than the average dose (in mg/kg terms) tested in PRO/GLY/001. It is therefore conceivable, given the 
variability in exposure to GP after oral administration, that some paediatric patients at the highest dose(s) 
may briefly attain a plasma concentration of GP sufficient to cause a vagolytic effect. However, if 
concentrations of this magnitude are achieved, they are likely to be very transient and have clinically 
insignificant effects on HR. 
Irrespective of treatment with GP, children with CP frequently have concurrent cardiac abnormalities, higher 
HR and more ECG abnormalities than normal controls. The PK simulations performed for Sialanar in the 
youngest target population demonstrate that the expected GP Cmax at steady state is far below the safety 
threshold of 10 μg/l generally considered for GP in relation to possible cardiovascular AEs. 
Tachycardia is a recognized and well-known effect of anticholinergic drugs and is currently the subject of 
spontaneous reports with existing formulations of GP. No events related to heart rate are reported in the 
available clinical studies, suggesting that increases in HR, should they have occurred were not clinically 
significant (Zeller, 2012a and b, Mier, 2000 and Parr, 2016). Five episodes of tachycardia are reported in the 
full cohort of children in CPRD, with 2 reported within 30 days following a GP prescription. The data does not 
support a clinically significant effect on HR in the target population.  
There were no events of raised BP recorded in the clinical studies in the target population, (Zeller, 2012a and 
b, Mier, 2000 and Parr, 2016) nor in the CPRD. The data does not support a hypertensive effect of GP in the 
target population.  
Zeller et al performed electrocardiogram (ECG) assessments in both studies and showed there were no 
significant effects on atrio-ventricular conduction as measured by the PR interval, or depolarization as 
measured by the QRS duration, at the doses of GP administered in these clinical trials (m2.7.4.2.1.5.3.2). 
Direct comparison of the simulated plasma levels of GP after the administration of Sialanar in the different 
paediatric age ranges with the PK observations reported by Drollmann et al (2014) concludes that the 
occurrence of QT prolongation in the target population is highly unlikely. The data does not support an effect 
on QT interval with GP in the target population.  
Nevertheless, despite the evidence suggesting minimal or no CV AEs due to GP in the target population, 
given the known CV effects of GP at the high doses used during anaesthetic treatment the following 
statement has been added to the SmPC: “Glycopyrronium is known to have an effect on heart rate and blood 
pressure at doses used during anaesthesia although clinical trials in children with chronic drooling have not 
shown this effect. An effect on the cardiovascular system should be considered when assessing tolerability”.  
Central nervous system  
Module 2.5.5.3.5 discusses the effects of GP on the CNS in detail, with particular attention to behavioural 
effects. GP has limited ability to penetrate the blood brain barrier and studies show low or absent 
concentrations of GP in the CSF, unless in the presence of a compromised BBB.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 102/143 
  
  
Clinical data on the use of GP in the target population provides inconsistent information on the occurrence of 
behavioural adverse events. In the studies by Zeller et al 2012a and Zeller et al, 2012b, centrally mediated 
side effects appear to have been limited in occurrence. Module 5.3.5.3, section 6.2.4 shows the following 
behavioural AEs and the % of subjects in which they occurred in the open-label study (Zeller, 2012b): 
irritability (5.8%); restlessness (3.6%); insomnia (2.2%; intentional self injury (2.2%); agitation (1.5%); 
crying (1.5%); altered mood (1.5%); aggression (0.7%). 
In the study by Mier et al, 2000, 23% of subjects had behavioural changes although the exact nature of 
these changes is not specified. Parents were questioned on a weekly basis about the presence of any AEs 
from a pre-specified list of possible AEs. Amongst the possible ‘behavioural’ AEs were: restless, overactive, or 
short attention span; easily frustrated, irritable; rapid mood changes; temper outbursts, explosive behaviour; 
overly sensitive, serious, sad, cries easily, fearful.  
The mean dose of GP in the study by Mier et al, was 0.11 mg/kg and the maximum 0.2 mg/kg per dose, 
more than 2-fold higher than the proposed maximum Sialanar dose. Bioavailability of GP from the 
extemporaneous capsules used in the study is unknown, so systemic exposure relative to Cuvposa or the 
Applicant’s product cannot be determined. However, given the high doses used in this study in some 
subjects, it is perhaps unsurprising that behavioural changes were observed in some subjects, although a link 
between maintenance dose and occurrence of AEs was not assessed.  
Behavioural changes noted in the study by Blasco et al, (1996) were all stated to be irritability.  
The low affinity for GP to cross the blood brain barrier, compared to other anticholinergic drugs is clearly seen 
in the DRI study (Parr, 2016). In a 12-week comparison with hyoscine in the treatment of children with 
neurodevelopmental disabilities and chronic drooling, unpredicted side effects leading to withdrawal showed 
hyoscine to be associated with; ataxia (3), hyperactivity (2), hypotonia/floppiness (1) and increased seizure 
activity (1); while glycopyrronium was associated with 1 episode of hyperactivity.  
AEs relating to behavioural problems were seen infrequently in CPRD in relation to GP treatment. Within the 
treatment window and in the lifetime of the patient respectively they include abnormal behaviour 2/22, 
agitation 3/9, anxiety 3/9, emotional distress 4/8 and irritability 1/16. If changes in psychiatric or 
behavioural events were seen following the introduction of GP treatment, they would be reported to the 
prescribing doctor, and therefore recorded in CPRD, particularly given that carers of these patients are 
attuned to the child’s normal patterns of behaviour.  
The low incidence of behavioural problems in this population was supported by verbal evidence presented by 
Dr Richard Hain (practising clinician and author of several reference texts on palliative care) during the OE 
Meeting on 31st March 2016. Dr Hain confirmed the position that in his extensive clinical experience there is 
a lack of behavioural issues seen in relation to GP treatment in this population.  
Based upon the data in the public domain it is not possible to determine if any of the reported centrally-
mediated AEs were related to the treatment or the underlying condition e.g. irritability is a known 
complication of CP related to pain from contractures. In addition, in the Mier publication AEs in the placebo 
period were not reported, and the studies by Blasco et al and Zeller et al, 2012b were both single arm in 
design. 
In summary, all of the available clinical data suggests that undesirable centrally mediated side effects are 
infrequent although they may occur in a small proportion of patients, especially at higher doses of GP and in 
those with compromised BBB. The specific behavioural changes mentioned in the published studies have 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 103/143 
  
  
been included as possible adverse events in SmPC section 4.8, which also includes the following warning in 
section 4.4, SmPC: 
“Glycopyrronium bromide is a quaternary ammonium member of the anticholinergic class of drugs and as a 
consequence of its quaternary charge, has limited ability to penetrate the blood brain barrier. Nevertheless, 
caution should be exercised in children with compromised blood brain barrier.”  
Adverse events relating to changes in behaviour are covered in the PIL, which as well as listing the known 
behavioural changes states: 
 “Tell your doctor if you notice any behavioural changes in the child”.  
Neurodevelopment  
Module 2.5.5.3.6 discusses the effects on neurodevelopment in detail. The Applicant has not identified any 
reports in the scientific literature of adverse effects of GP on neurodevelopment. By 3 years of age healthy 
children would be expected to have a sufficiently well-developed BBB and GP, when given in the doses 
proposed by the Applicant, would not be expected to result in neurodevelopmental effects. There were no 
reports of AEs related to neurodevelopment, including growth (weight and height), in the DAP submitted as 
part of the application (MHRA, 2014), and none have been reported in the post-marketing data included in 
the product information for Cuvposa. CPRD does not give any indication of effects of GP on 
neurodevelopment including growth. Given that GP has been in continuous use for more than 10 years in the 
UK and often covering many years of a patient’s life, without any concern being expressed relating to adverse 
effects on neurodevelopment or growth, the Applicant considers such effects to be highly unlikely to occur 
with Sialanar.  
Urinary retention  
Module 2.5.5.3.3 discusses the effects on the renal system in detail. Urinary retention is a known 
complication of anticholinergic treatment, with 3 cases (15%) occurring in the placebo-controlled study 
(Zeller, 2012a). In CPRD a total of 2 events of urinary retention occurred within the 30-day window following 
treatment with GP compared to 8 events in the total population. Despite urinary retention being a known 
complication of severe neurodevelopmental disability plus its known association with anticholinergic drugs, it 
was recorded infrequently in this dataset. Analysis of the individual patient histories shows that where urinary 
retention occurred whilst a patient was treated with GP, (2 incidences) treatment was withdrawn within a 
narrow time period following the event. 
CPRD records significant events presenting to a general practitioner during the lifetime of the patient and 
events will generally occur with a lower frequency compared to randomised clinical trials. In the case of 
urinary retention, the parent or carer is highly likely to know how to manage its occurrence and as such it is 
less likely to be reported as a new adverse event when it occurs.  
The SmPC advises that urinary retention is a known adverse event and treatment with GP should be stopped 
if urinary retention occurs. Evidence from CPRD shows GP treatment withdrawal in the event of an episode of 
urinary retention to be current clinical practice. 
Pneumonia  
Module 2.5.5.3.2 discusses the effects on the respiratory system in detail. Pneumonia is a known 
complication associated with severe mental disability. Data from CPRD shows that 28/106 (26.4%) episodes 
of pneumonia occurred whilst the patients were being treated with GP. Detailed analysis of the individual 
patient histories shows that of these 28 episodes, treatment with GP was discontinued within 40 days of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 104/143 
  
  
event in 75% of cases. Treatment was continued, often for many months in 25% of cases, with concurrent 
resolution of the pneumonia. The SmPC advises that pneumonia is a known adverse event and treatment 
with GP should be discontinued if it occurs. CPRD data provides evidence that this approach is used in current 
clinical practice in 75% of cases, suggesting that GP is only continued where it is deemed to be clinically 
appropriate.  
Summary of the safety information on areas of concern to CHMP  
The following summarises the data provided to justify the position that safety data has been sufficiently 
characterised in terms of chronic use, age, cardiovascular effect, developmental effects, urinary retention and 
CNS effects. 
 • From the available data there appears to be an inverse association between continued use of GP and 
incidence of AEs. 
 • Age is known to affect the incidence of AEs with younger children being more susceptible to AEs in general. 
CPRD supports this position, showing more AEs in younger children per se, and more AEs in younger children 
treated with GP for sialorrhoea than in older children.  
• AEs can be effectively managed through optimising dose to balance efficacy with tolerability 
• AEs only lead to treatment withdrawal in a small percentage of subjects (Parr, 2016).  
• The significant adverse events of urinary retention, constipation and pneumonia are associated with use of 
GP, as evidenced by clinical trials and CPRD data. 
These events have the potential for significant clinical implications and evidence from CPRD suggests that 
treatment discontinuation is the current clinical practice.  
• The Applicant has included urinary retention, constipation and pneumonia in the SmPC as adverse events 
requiring treatment discontinuation should they occur.  
• There is no information in the published literature or in CPRD to suggest an effect of GP on 
neurodevelopment or growth (height and weight). Cerebral palsy and other neurodevelopmental disabilities 
are known to be associated with reduced growth and difficulty in feeding often means the children are 
underweight for their age.  
• The SmPC includes a statement that the effects on growth and neurodevelopment are unknown and no 
studies have been conducted to specifically address such an effect.  
The available data conclusively support the Applicant’s position that no new or unexpected events are evident 
despite long-term treatment with GP in many patients. The AEs known to occur can be effectively managed 
through dose titration or treatment withdrawal in line with current clinical practice.  
Given the weight of the available safety data m2.5.5, including that from the extensive, real-life clinical 
histories available through CPRD, it is evident that the safety of GP in the Applicant’s product for the 
proposed indication has been adequately characterised in particular for chronic use, age, CV effect, 
developmental effects, urinary retention and CNS effects.

carcinogenicity. Extrapolation of safety margins to the proposed population are not considered adequate 
due to lack of toxicokinetic exposure data; (Point 2) 
Applicant’s grounds for re-examination: Point 2 
The CHMP are concerned about the lack of adequate non-clinical data in support of the claimed indication and 
do not consider there to be sufficient assurance on repeat use toxicology, reproductive/developmental 
toxicology, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity. In addition, extrapolation of safety margins to the proposed 
population are not considered adequate due to lack of toxicokinetic exposure data. 
The following is a summary of the available data on the points of concern which must be read in conjunction 
with m2.4 and m2.5, and includes the relevant clinical data from the CPRD analysis. Given the pre-clinical 
evidence available and the extensive body of clinical evidence, the Applicant remains of the position that 
further nonclinical studies would not provide any new data that would change the efficacy, safety or 
tolerability profile of Sialanar in the target population. Module 2.4 provides details of the full non-clinical 
package 
Repeat use toxicology 
According to the Guideline on the non-clinical documentation for mixed marketing authorization applications, 
CPMP/SWP/799/95, 2005, single dose and repeated dose toxicity, as well as local tolerance investigations are 
normally not necessary. Likewise pharmacological investigations including safety pharmacology and 
pharmacokinetics are normally not necessary. 
A repeat dose oral toxicity study in dogs with administration of dose levels of 4, 16, and 64 mg/kg for up to 
27 weeks was associated with pharmacological effects, but no overt toxicity; although there is limited 
experimental detail. In repeated dose toxicity studies with oral and inhalation drug administration in mice, 
rats, and dogs, mainly an exaggerated PD activity was seen at high dose levels but there were no clear toxic 
effect on any organs or tissue that was not associated with the PD. The lowest NOAEL with inhalation was 
determined in a study in dogs with daily drug inhalation for 39 weeks at 0.02 mg/kg bw. 
The lowest NOAEL with oral drug administration was determined in mice at 30 mg/kg bw, although 
administered for 7 days only. As drug absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is low, and local effects in the 
lung were observed upon inhalation, the NOAEL from oral drug administration appears more relevant. The 
dose level of 30 mg/kg bw in the mouse corresponds to a human equivalent dose of 30 mg/kg / 12.3 = 2.44 
mg/kg bw. 
The safety profile observed in the long-term animal studies is observed in both the open-label safety study 
over 24 weeks (Zeller RS et al, Safety and efficacy of glycopyrrolate oral solution for management of 
pathologic drooling in paediatric patients with cerebral palsy or other neurologic conditions. Ther Clin Risk 
Manag 2012, 8:25-32) and in the data from the CPRD. GP has been used extensively in the UK in the target 
population for the past 10 years as evidenced from the data in CPRD. The cohort of 428 patients treated with 
GP for sialorrhoea provided information on a population equivalent to 26,089 children age 3- 17 years 
covering 24,684 patient-years. Within this period, children received GP treatment for sialorrhoea for an 
equivalent of 435 patient-years. In total 1,797 treatment episodes occurred of which 1,565 (87.1%) lasted 
up to 6 months with a further 170 (9.5%) lasting from 7 to 18 months. The remaining 62 (3.4%) treatment 
episodes ranged from 19 to 92 months. AEs were related to the known anticholinergic effects and the 
Assessment report

incidence of AEs decreased with increasing treatment duration. No additional repeat use non-clinical data 
would alter the safety conclusions from the available clinical information. 
Reproductive/developmental toxicity 
According to the Guideline on the non-clinical documentation for mixed marketing authorization applications, 
CPMP/SWP/799/95, 2005, investigations regarding fertility and general reproductive performance are 
generally not necessary unless there is cause for concern. Investigations of embryo-foetal toxicity and 
peri/post-natal development are not necessary if sufficient data from exposures in pregnant women and 
neonates are available or if the medicinal product is not intended for use in women of child-bearing potential 
or during pregnancy and lactation. 
Glycopyrronium was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits. In preclinical studies investigating effects on fertility, 
conflicting results were obtained, but no clear and reproducible effect was observed. Excretion of 
glycopyrronium in milk was reported, and effects on postnatal development were observed in rats. In the 
currently proposed indication GP will be administered mainly to children, and no effects on reproduction are 
known from human experience. The data from the CPRD show no evidence that GP causes reproductive or 
developmental toxicity. AEs in CPRD showed that in the reproductive system there were 18 events in patients 
whilst being treated with GP out of a total of 63 events (m1.5.1. Appendix 1). Twelve separate events were 
recorded with no individual event occurring in the treated cohort on more than 3 occasions. There is no 
evidence of an effect of GP on the reproductive system in this patient population. Additional 
reproductive/developmental non-clinical studies would not alter the safety profile of GP nor change the 
contraindication in pregnancy and breast feeding. The Applicant proposes that the label will caution women of 
child bearing potential to take appropriate contraceptive precautions and warns that glycopyrronium should 
not be used in pregnant or lactating women. 
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
From the available data in the published literature, GP was not mutagenic and not clastogenic in genotoxicity 
studies and was also not carcinogenic in carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice (Module 2.4). 
The potential for carcinogenic effects was examined in the CPRD. The SOC Neoplasm showed 71 events in the 
full cohort of which 19 occurred during the GP treatment window. There were no AEs relating to a 
carcinogenic potential. Comparing the AEs in this SOC, within the GP treatment window compared to the full 
cohort shows the majority to be skin papilloma (15/58) [mainly warts and verrucae], followed by melanocytic 
naevus (3/13) [moles] and lipoma (1/3). There is no evidence of a carcinogenic potential of GP in this patient 
population. As such, no additional information that would alter clinical practice would be gained from 
preforming non-clinical genotoxicity or carcinogenicity studies.  
Extrapolation of safety margins and toxicokinetic exposure 
In repeated dose toxicity studies with oral and inhalation drug administration in mice, rats, and dogs, mainly 
an exaggerated pharmacodynamic activity was seen at high dose levels but no clear toxic effects outside of 
those associated with the PF activity were seen on any organ or tissue. The lowest NOAEL with inhalation was 
determined in a study in dogs with daily drug inhalation for 39 weeks at 0.02 mg/kg bw. The lowest NOAEL 
with oral drug administration was determined in mice at 30 mg/kg bw, although administered for 7 days 
only. As drug absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is low, and local effects in the lung were observed 
upon inhalation, the NOAEL from oral drug administration appears more relevant. The dose level of 30 mg/kg 
bw in the mouse corresponds to a human equivalent dose of 30 mg/kg / 12.3 = 2.44 mg/kg bw. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 107/143 
  
  
In children, the proposed starting dose is 0.02 mg/kg, three times a day, to be increased according to the 
schedule up to a maximum of 0.08 mg/kg (2.4 mg) three times a day, i.e. 7.2 mg/day or 0.24 mg/kg per 
day. Individual titration of doses is a critical aspect of administration since the margin between desirable 
effects and exaggerated pharmacology is small. The safety margin between the safe human equivalent dose 
calculated from the NOAEL with oral administration to mice of 2.44 mg/kg bw and the maximum intended 
dose in children can be calculated at 2.44 mg/kg bw / 0.24 mg/kg bw = 10.17. A safety margin of 10 is 
generally recognized as safe, and therefore with a safety margin of 10.17, the therapeutic use of 
glycopyrronium as recommended in the intended indication is not expected to be associated with any 
unexpected risk to human health. 
Doses are not relevant per se but rather the resultant drug exposure (expressed as area under the plasma 
concentration-time curve, AUC), with the relationship between dose and AUC being primarily driven by 
clearance (AUC = dose/clearance). In this sense, the AUC obtained in adults and children of different body 
weights after administration of glycopyrronium bromide at the same dosing regimen (i.e., ~0.08 mg/kg three 
times a day, according to the dosing schedule proposed for Sialanar) was very similar (as depicted in the 
figure below) thus supporting the safety of the intended dosing regimen in both adults and children ≥3 years.

virtual populations (N=100 each) of children with 13 kg body weight (~3 years of age), 28 kg (~10 years of age) and 
adults (60 kg). 
Note: For clarity, only the last dose is shown, with the corresponding mean AUC and Cmax values for each population

Simulations (shown in the figure above) were performed using the compartmental PK parameters estimated 
in adults from the model developed by the applicant using data of study PRO/GLY/001, in conjunction with 
allometric extrapolation of clearance and volume of distribution to children of different body weights 
(m5.3.3.5). The data presented above and the extensive clinical efficacy and safety package provide 
sufficient evidence for the safe and effective use of GP in the target population. Additional non-clinical data 
on extrapolation of safety margins and toxicokinetic exposure would alter the clinical profile or use of GP.

Applicant’s grounds for re-examination: Point 3 
The CHMP considers that the lack of sufficient and reliable qualitative and quantitative data and subsequent 
resulting uncertainties do not allow establishment that GP has been used in the European Union for the 
symptomatic treatment of sialorrhoea (chronic pathological drooling) in children and adolescents aged 3 to 
<18 years with neurological disorders due to a lack of information to support an acceptable level of safety. 
The application falls therefore short of demonstrating that the requirements of Article 10a of Directive 
2001/83/EC are fulfilled.  
The Applicant has provided adequate qualitative and quantitative data to confirm the well established 
medicinal use of GP in the target population for the target indication for more than 10 years in at least one 
EU country (m1.5.1) which confirms:  
• The regular use of GP for the treatment of sialorrhoea for over 10 years in at least one EU country,  
• The extent to which GP has been used in clinical practice,  
• The extent of GP use on a geographical basis,  
• The extent to which the use of GP has been monitored by pharmacovigilance or other methods,  
• The degree of scientific interest and coherence of assessments in the use of GP,  
• The efficacy and safety profile of GP in the target population for the target indication, and  
• The efficacy and safety of GP within the EU.  
The above information has been accepted by CHMP with the exception of the evidence to justify an 
acceptable level of safety. The above discussions on Point 1 and the comprehensive evidence presented in 
m2.5 fully justify the position that GP has an acceptable level of safety in the target population. The specific 
issues of chronic use of Sialanar in the paediatric population affected by the underlying conditions, with 
particular emphasis on the risks of cardiovascular effects, developmental effects, urinary retention and CNS 
effects have been examined, as well as the inclusion of data on differences in AE profiles depending on the 
age of the child, plus the risks associated with pneumonia. Data from the clinical trials and information 
extracted from the extensive real-life clinical use database, CPRD provides conclusive evidence that sufficient 
information is available for all points of concern regarding the use of GP in the target population. GP is dosed 
by slow titration, starting with a low dose based on body weight and increasing over several weeks to balance 
efficacy with side effects and tolerability.  
As such, the application meets all of the requirements of Article 10a of Directive 2001/83/EC.

associated with any improvement in the quality of life in the claimed indication.

Applicant’s grounds for re-examination: Point 4 
The CHMP do not consider that Sialanar is associated with any improvement in the quality of life in the 
claimed indication based on their view of the outstanding safety issues. 
Use of GP for the treatment of sialorrhoea is based on its pharmacodynamic effect of drying secretions. 
Module 2.5.4 contains detailed analysis of the data supporting the efficacy of GP in the target population. Six 
published studies include data on the efficacy of GP in the treatment of sialorrhoea in children with 
neurological disorders (Parr, 2016, Zeller, 2012a; Zeller, 2012b; Meir, 2000; Blasco, 1996; Stern, 1997), 
which provide the basis for its clinical use in EU for over 10 years. The majority of the evidence supporting 
the efficacy of GP in sialorrhoea comes from the three pivotal studies (2 being 8-week, placebo controlled and 
one large open safety study). The efficacy of GP in long-term use was demonstrated in a 24 week open-label 
study by Zeller et al, 2012b, comprising a 4-week dose titration phase followed by a 20-week maintenance 
period at the individualized dose.  
In addition, information is available from a recently completed 12 week trial conducted in the UK, comparing 
the efficacy and safety of GP against hyoscine for the treatment of sialorrhoea in the target population (Parr, 
2016). Children age 3-15 years who had never received medication to treat drooling were recruited from 15 
UK centres and randomised to hyoscine or glycopyrronium; stratification was by centre and drooling severity. 
Dose adjustment and side effect monitoring were undertaken weekly by the trial team over 4 weeks to 
identify the most effective dose for each child in the context of any side effects. Primary outcome data were 
gathered with the standardised Drooling Impact Scale (DIS) at 4 weeks by a researcher blind to treatment 
group status. Follow up continued to 12 weeks.  
Ninety children (median age 4.9 years) were randomised (49 hyoscine and 41 glycopyrronium). Of these, 48 
children started hyoscine treatment, and 38 started glycopyrronium. By 4 weeks, 35/48 children (73%) 
remained on hyoscine and 33/38 (87%) on glycopyrronium; the remaining children had stopped trial 
medication due to side effects. By 12 weeks, 26/48 children (54%) remained on hyoscine and 31/38 (82%) 
on glycopyrronium. At 4 weeks there was no significant difference in DIS scores between the treatment 
groups suggesting both medications were equally effective at the maximum tolerated dose. However, by 4 
and 12 weeks hyoscine was associated with more problematic side effects than glycopyrronium and parents 
were more likely to withdraw hyoscine treatment.  
Therefore, all clinical studies conducted in the target population concluded that GP was an efficacious drug 
with an acceptable benefit-risk profile when dosed to clinical effect, balanced with side effects, over a number 
of weeks. 
However, it is important to know whether improving drooling will have a positive impact a patient’s Quality of 
Life (QOL). Drooling itself has a substantial impact on utility (and therefore on overall health related quality 
of life). As such, it follows that reducing drooling, for example with GP, would have a positive impact on the 
patient’s QOL. The effect of drooling on QoL has been conducted in patients with cerebral palsy. Mapping this 
data has allowed an estimation of utility values for drooling in cerebral palsy (QOL Mapping), provided as 
m2.5 Appendix 1. An improvement in drooling through treatment with GP would equate to an improvement in 
QOL in patients with cerebral palsy. Whilst there are several limitations that could decrease the validity of the 
application of the mapping algorithm the analysis of the difference in QOL in paediatric patients with cerebral 
palsy is significant between patients who drool and those who never drool.  
The safety data presented above and in m2.5 confirms the expected safety profile for GP whether in 
published trials or in the analysis of data from CPRD. Evidence shows increased AEs with GP treatment, which 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016

are dose related and, as evidenced in the DRI study, led to discontinuation of treatment in just 18% of case 
versus 45% in patients on hyoscine. It is also clear from the results of the DRI study that parents are able to 
recognize side effects, modify dose or withdraw treatment as necessary, thereby ensuring that any 
improvement in the child’s QOL is not compromised by the presence of adverse events.  
There is no evidence to suggest GP causes any new AEs, beyond those known with anticholinergic drugs, and 
seen in both clinical trials and the CPRD. The slow dose titration, based on body weight, and the flexibility 
afforded with a liquid presentation, delivered through an oral dosing syringe, allows AEs to be easily managed 
through dose reduction or treatment withdrawal if required. As shown in the DRI study, parents/carers are 
able to recognize and mange AEs through dose reduction or withdrawal as required. As such, the 
improvement in QOL provided by effective treatment is not compromised by adverse events since these can 
be effectively managed through dose adjustment. The fact that many patients remain on treatment for 
several months and in some cases years supports the positive benefit : risk ratio for Sialanar in the treatment 
of chronic drooling in children with neurological disorders. 
Applicant’s Overall Summary of Grounds for Re-Examination 
Uncertainties about safety in relation to chronic use, age, CV system, CNS including behaviour and 
neurodevelopment, urinary retention and pneumonia have been discussed in detail above and in m2.5. The 
significant adverse events of urinary retention, constipation and pneumonia are associated with use of GP, as 
evidenced by clinical trials and CPRD data. These events have the potential for significant clinical implications 
and evidence from CPRD suggests that treatment discontinuation is the current clinical practice. The 
Applicant has included urinary retention, constipation and pneumonia in the SmPC as adverse events 
requiring treatment discontinuation should they occur.  
There is no information to suggest an effect of GP on neurodevelopment or growth (height and weight). 
Cerebral palsy and other neurodevelopmental disabilities are known to be associated with reduced growth 
and difficulty in feeding often means the children are underweight for their age. The SmPC includes a 
statement that the effects on growth and neurodevelopment are unknown and no studies have been 
conducted to specifically address such an effect.  
The non-clinical data to address repeat-use toxicology, reproductive/developmental toxicology, genotoxicity 
and carcinogenicity and extrapolation of safety margins to the proposed population have been discussed 
based on both non-clinical and clinical evidence. The data provides sufficient assurance on each of these 
points, given the extent of clinical use and the detailed evidence available from CPRD. New nonclinical data 
would not provide evidence to alter any of the paediatric safety information or the proposed labelling.  
It is important to ensure that any known improvement in QOL, resulting from effective reduction of drooling 
with GP, is not offset by the presence of detrimental adverse effects. The safety data presented in the 
application confirms the expected safety profile for GP both in published trials and in the analysis of data 
from CPRD. Evidence shows increased AEs with GP treatment, which are dose related. However, as evidenced 
in the DRI study, AEs lead to discontinuation of treatment in just 18% of case versus 45% in patients on 
hyoscine showing they can be effectively managed through dose adjustment or withdrawal as necessary. 
Therefore, improvement in QOL through effective treatment would not be overshadowed by adverse events, 
supporting the overall positive benefit : risk ratio in this chronically disabled population. In addition, it is clear 
that parents/carers are well able to recognise and manage AEs and maintain adequate reduction in drooling 
for an improved QOL. 
In conclusion, the safety of Sialanar is sufficiently characterized and the benefits of treatment outweigh the 
safety risks for the symptomatic treatment of sialorrhoea (chronic pathological drooling) in children and

adolescents aged 3 to <18 years with neurological disorders. The Applicant has justified a favourable overall 
benefit/risk balance with sufficient safety evidence to allow the granting of the marketing authorization for 
Sialanar. 
Following a request from the applicant at the time of the re-examination, the CHMP convened an Ad Hoc 
expert Group inviting the experts to provide their views on specific questions based on the CHMP grounds for 
refusal, taking into account the applicant’s response.  
Report from the ad hoc expert group 
1.  Please discuss the negative consequences associated with excessive drooling in children and 
adolescents with neurological conditions with respect to health and quality of life. 
a.   How is the condition handled in clinical practice? If medical treatment is given, is the 
treatment chronic or intermittent? 
Different treatment approaches to pathological drooling exist varying from country to country and depending 
on the severity of the condition. In the UK and in Belgium, Glycopyrronium (or Hyoscine patches) are in 
regular use particularly in the palliative care setting given continuously in patients with progressive disease 
and at the end of life and in children with cerebral palsy and other severe neurological problems. Whereas 
Hyoscine patches carry the advantage of easier application, oral glycopyrronium can be titrated more easily. 
Together with Botulinumtoxin injections physicians choose from this armamentarium depending on treatment 
response of the individual patient. 
On the other hand, in Sweden, speech therapy is the preferred treatment approach and drug treatment like 
Scopolamin or Botulinumtoxin injections are seldom used (Atropin in the palliative care setting). In the 
Netherlands treatment is started with speech therapy/awareness as the first step, followed by Botulinumtoxin 
injections. Glycopyrronium are given intermittently / short term in case Botulinumtoxin injections are not 
feasible. 
As a whole, treatment duration depends on the patient conditions. In palliative care it is rather long term 
continuous, in other situations it may be more short term/intermittent. 
The experts noted that none of these options have a license for such use and the diversity is also driven by 
what is locally available. It was generally agreed that Glycopyrronium should only be used in clearly severe 
cases of drooling and the treatment closely monitored by specialists in the field.  
b.  What are the most serious consequences for the patients and care givers associated 
with excessive drooling? 
Aspiration was considered as one of the most important consequences of drooling. In severely affected 
patients the control of potential reflux in children heavily choking was considered critical to alleviate distress. 
Other raised consequences were sore skin and dehydration in patients with Rett Syndrome. In less affected 
patients also psychosocial concerns like embarrassment and lower self-esteem play a role. Overall the 
experts highlighted that excessive drooling as seen in severe cases is significantly impacting the patients and 
treatment is an important element of patient care.  
c.   Is there an unmet medical need that could potentially be fulfilled by glycopyrronium 
bromide? 
The experts considered that for the treatment of severe drooling, all available treatment options have their 
limitations. None of the alternatives is approved. Furthermore, the Botulinumtoxin injections are very 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 112/143 
  
  
dependent on the expertise of the treating doctor, Hyoscine patches do not allow sufficient dose titration and 
radiotherapy can lead to overtreatment. Crushed tablets of Glycopyrronium are broadly used in clinical 
practise with uncertain bioavailability. An age adapted oral formulation with stable bioavailability of 
Glycopyrronium would allow dose titration which would help to individualize the treatment in particular for 
severely affected patients with severe oropharyngeal dysphagia who are often treated with numerous drugs. 
In the United Kingdom Glycopyrronium is used as part of the treatment protocol of severe siallorhea in 
terminal ill patients. 
d. Please reflect on your potential clinical experience with anticholinergics, including 
glycopyrronium bromide, in the treatment of children and adolescents with neurological 
conditions, with respect to impact on QoL, efficacy and safety, duration of treatment etc. 
The experts considered that in severe drooling where the patient is choking and may be at risk of aspiration 
and dehydration, the impact on QoL of an effective therapy can easily be assumed. The duration of treatment 
in severe progressive disease is continuous but depends on the response of the patient. To get severe 
consequences of drooling under control is an interdisciplinary approach including also pulmonologists. 
The place in therapy was not seen within a light or moderately affected patient population due to the side 
effects and the use of speech therapy as first line treatment. 
It was further emphasized that expert prescription would be crucial taking into consideration comorbidities 
and co-medication of these patients. Constipation is commonly seen in these patients due to immobility and 
might become more severe under Glycopyrronium.  
2.  From a pharmacological point of view, the adverse event profile of glycopyrronium bromide 
could be considered to be predictable (potent M3 blocker, but also with affinity at all five 
human muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor subtypes). However, literature data 
confirming the safety profile in paediatric and chronical clinical use is sparse. 
a. Which are in your view, the most serious/relevant adverse events that could be expected in 
the target population in clinical practice (e.g urine retention, dry mouth with secondary risk 
for caries, pneumonia, obstipation, CNS effects)? 
Over drying was emphasized as one of the most serious concerns as it leads to thick mucus which may lead 
to pneumonia. Furthermore, constipation is common in this less mobile patient population and can get more 
severe. Also worsening of balance problems were observed in clinical practise. The risk of caries was 
particularly emphasized and risk minimisation measure should strongly address this issue. The risk of urinary 
retention was acknowledged but rather seen as a result of too quick up titration. Urinary retention was 
perceived manageable for a drug with predictable bioavailability with regular check-ups and adequate 
information to the prescriber about dose titration. Furthermore, the carer should be informed not to change 
the dose without expert advice. 
The effects on CNS of concomitant medication rather than Glycopyrronium in severely affected patients may 
be more pronounced. A possible additional effect of Glycopyrronium on CNS might be negligible in the 
context of severe disease. 
Less severe affected patient with pre-existing ataxia should certainly not be considered for treatment with 
Glycopyrronium. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 113/143 
  
  
b. Please discuss the possibility to identify these adverse events in children with neurological 
conditions. Is there a risk that a too high dose of glycopyrronium bromide may be given since 
adverse events may not be detected? 
Severely affected patients are mostly also handicapped in their ability to communicate due to their 
neurological condition. However the experts considered that parents / carers of these patients are in general 
very skilful to interpret their non-verbal communication and to raise potential side effects to the treating 
physician. Careful titration of the right dose by the treating physician together with robust guidance on the 
identification and management of side effects may minimize this risk. 
c. Please discuss to what extent these are manageable AEs and what additional risk 
minimization measures could be implemented to ensure a safer use  
Parents of affected patients were considered to actively seek information about the well-being of their 
children. Therefore, easily understandable and readable educational material should be available for them 
and the dose should not be increased by the carers without specialist consultation. In addition, dedicated 
material for adolescents would be needed. In particular, as long term safety information was considered 
scarce there would be a need to inform patients / carers how to interpret indirect symptoms and record 
relevant information (e.g. urine diary), as well as a regular check at close time intervals by the treating 
specialist.  
d. Please discuss if additional data would be needed to characterize the safety profile in the 
proposed target population 
Deficiencies in robust long-term data and the long term benefit risk were acknowledged by the experts but 
needs to be seen in the context of the severity of the disease. Reassurance that patients are given the most 
appropriate dose with the recommended titration scheme would make sense which may be covered by a drug 
utilisation study. 
3.  Are  there  differences  on  how  drooling  affects  Quality  of  life  in  different  age  groups  of  the 
target population? Considering different degrees of neurological impairment would it be easier 
for older children and adolescents (appr.>12 years) to express symptoms from side effects of 
an anti-cholinergic acting drug than for younger children i.e. could benefit risk for Sialanar be 
different for different age groups? 
The experts emphasised the current limitation of the use to severe patients and confirmed that in clinical 
practice identification of side effects in this population should be feasible. Severe drooling was considered 
sufficiently defined as understandable term for the prescriber. Whereas older paediatric patients may rather 
be treated with Botulinumtoxin injections, the age range was seen of rather negligible importance by the 
experts for the benefit from the treatment and quality of life. More importantly impacting on the benefit is the 
severity of the drooling. The age cut of 3 years was considered appropriate for a label as reflecting the 
population where data is available, however reflecting clinical practise in the UK, it might make sense not to 
contraindicate the treatment even in younger children as in very particular circumstances, such as at the end 
of life, there might be a use.

Muscarinic receptors are widely distributed throughout the human body and mediate distinct physiological 
functions according to location and receptor subtype (see Caulfield & Birdsall, 1998). Five distinct muscarinic 
receptor subtypes (M1–M5) are known to exist, although the exact location and functional role of all these 
subtypes has to date not been fully elucidated (Abrams et al, British J of Pharmacology, 2006). 
Glycopyrronium bromide (GP) is a potent M3 blocker. Salivation is primarily mediated by M3 receptor. 
However, GP has affinity at all five human muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor subtypes (Ki = 0.15 – 2.0 
nM) in order M1 > M3 > M2/M4 > M5. GP is 2-4 times more selective for the M3 and M1 subtypes than M2 
(Bird et al. 2011). This has implication for the effects and adverse events of anti cholinergic drugs. These side 
effects may be a clinical disadvantage when using drugs with anti-cholinergic effects and especially in long-
time treatment. 
The frequency of adverse anticholinergic effect are ranging between 10-40% in the data presented by the 
Applicant and for most of the events difference from placebo was seen in the placebo controlled studies 
(Zeller 2012a and Mier 2000). The adverse events are dose dependent. The Applicant proposes a dose 
titration table to establish the lowest effective individual dose and with a careful assessment of side effects 
which is reasonable. 
The therapeutic effect of GP is easily assessed by the caregiver.  However, when it comes to adverse events 
such as, dry mouth with risk for caries and urinary retention, the symptoms may be difficult for the caregiver 
to identify when the patient has limited ability to communicate. Urinary retention can predispose for urinary 
infections and also reflux leading to tubular atrophy and renal injury. 
The concerns of the CHMP were particularly with regards to cardiovascular effect, CNS effects, urinary 
retention and developmental effects. In addition as a result of the pharmacological effect there is a high risk 
of dry mouth with a secondary risk for caries.  
Cardiovascular effects 
The plasma concentration of GP required for effective vagolysis has been determined to be at least 10 μg/L. 
In studies in children by Rautokorpi et al, 1994 and Rautokorpi et al, 1998 plasma concentrations following a 
5 μg/kg i.v. dose of GP only briefly exceeded this concentration immediately following administration. In 
study PRO/GLY/001, the maximum plasma concentration after 2 mg (~0.03 mg/kg) of Sialanar in adult 
volunteers occurred between 3 and 7 hours post dose, reaching a maxima of ~1000 pg/mL (i.e. 1 μg/L). The 
highest dose of Sialanar(0.1 mg/kg) in the Applicant’s proposed posology is 3.3 fold higher than the average 
dose (in mg/kg terms) tested in PRO/GLY/001. It is therefore conceivable, given the variability in exposure to 
GP after oral administration, that some paediatric patients at the highest dose(s) may briefly attain a plasma 
concentration of GP sufficient to cause a vagolytic effect. This observations were confirmed by the number of 
occurrences of cardiac events which were extremely low in the CPRD . No significant effects of HR were seen 
in the pediatric data presented by the applicant. In addition, no effects were seen on blood pressure and the 
experts having experience of GP use, did not recognized CV effects as a common adverse effect in this 
patient population. Considering the expert opinions, the available data mentioned above this is considered to 
be reassuring. The CHMP considers therefore that the remaining potential risk is acceptable considering the 
clinical benefit which is more relevant for severely affected patients comprised in the amended indication. The 
SmPC informs about cardiac effects and outlines that effects on the cardiovascular system should be 
considered when assessing tolerability and additionally robust educational material was established (see also 
conclusion on ground 1 below) which is considered to be sufficient in this setting.

Central nervous system 
In the brain are mainly M1 receptors. The Applicant states that GP passes the BBB in very limited amount 
except in situations where the BBB has been compromised e.g. by a shunt infection. However, there are 
several situations where the BBB becomes ‘leaky' following damage (e.g. under conditions of stress, 
advanced age or presence of comorbid conditions such as diabetes or multiple sclerosis) (Abrams et al, 
British J of Pharmacology, 2006). The grade of passage over the BBB is also affected by the dose and at 
long-term treatment a certain passage cannot be excluded for all patients. In the study of Mier there was a 
higher frequency of AEs related to CNS (23%) in the GP group compared to placebo and the Applicant points 
to that the dose in the Mier study was higher. Still, this raises concern that some children treated have a 
more pronounced risk of transfer of GP into CNS. The main concern of the CHMP was that in the case of CNS 
adverse effects these may be difficult to assess for the caregiver  and depending on the neurological disease 
with fluctuations of alertness can be difficult to distinguish from side effects of the medication.  
The ad hoc experts acknowledged that potential effect on CNS may be seen with the use of GP, but based on 
their experience this may not be a serious problem in severely affected patients who are taking in general 
multiple medications with CNS effects. This was taken into consideration by the CHMP together with the 
expert’s view that caregivers / parents of these patients can be considered in general highly skillful to detect 
changes in the behavior of their children. Considering the narrower indication (severely affected patients) and 
the particular clinical benefit of these patients available data with respect to potential risk of CNS effect was 
considered as sufficient by the CHMP and a potential risk was considered acceptable with the warning 
included into the SmPC on CNS adverse effects and the established risk minimization measures.   
Concerning neurological development including growth the Applicant points to that there are no evident 
reports of AEs during the ten years that GP has been used in the UK. Furthermore, the CPRD does not give 
any indication of effects on neurodevelopment. Even though the CHMP recognizes that this data, due to its 
nature, must be interpreted with care.  However considering that the indication was restricted to short-term 
intermittent use and the exposure will be minimized also in case of repeated treatment this issue can be 
considered solved.  
Other effects 
Another serious side effect is pneumonia and the data from Zeller 2012(b) suggests a causal relationship with 
GP, this was acknowledged by the Applicant and advice is added to the SmPC and the educational material 
that, should it occur, the treatment should be discontinued. The experts raised that inappropriate dosing of 
GP leads to thick mucus and pneumonia and that this risk can be considered manageable with careful 
titration.  Obstipation is a further side effect that may be severe in this setting of patients because this may 
also be a result of the low degree of physical activity in these patients. However, based on the deliberations 
of the experts this side effect is considered sufficiently detectable by a caregiver trained with adequate 
educational material if advised to be attentive to this risk.  
Based on the expert feedback the CHMP considers both, pneumonia (via over drying) and obstipation to be 
manageable by the trained and experience caregiver and prescriber as they are detectable and mostly results 
of inappropriate titration. This key problem is now sufficiently addressed by educational material and the 
planned DUS (as outlined in the RMP). Taking all this into consideration, the CHMP concluded that the 
submitted data referring to these adverse events is sufficient for an approval in the new target population. 
Urinary retention was reported with an incidence of 13-15% with GP in randomized controlled clinical studies 
whereas not occurring in the placebo arm and there was no information provided on the severity of the 
episodes of urinary retention nor if it was associated with an increased incidence of urinary tract infections. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 116/143 
  
  
This risk of urinary retention was acknowledged by the experts even though not commonly seen in the 
treated patients in clinical practice. The experts considered urinary retention sufficiently detectable by the 
caregivers (e.g. by urine diary) and as manageable with careful titration of the drug by the treating physician 
together with robust guidance on the identification and management of side effects. The CHMP considers that 
taking into consideration the expert prescription, the caregivers which were seen as in general very skillful by 
the ad hoc experts in detecting side effects, the recommendations given in the SmPC and in the educational 
material on careful titration and recommended action if side effects occur as sufficient to balance the risk of 
urinary retention. An age appropriate formulation of GP such as Sialanar may also facilitate titration as 
outlined by the expert. Furthermore the implemented DUS addresses further the underlying problem of 
inadequate titration which was stressed by the ad hoc expert. Together with the implemented short-term 
intermittent use and recommendations in the SmPC on considering carefully the benefit risk of the patient if 
treatment is repeated sufficient assurance is given on the control of this risk.  
Dry mouth is probably an inevitable side effect of GP as this is the effect that the treatment is aiming for. It is 
known that dry mouth is a severe risk factor for caries and a high level of mouth hygiene is necessary. As 
these patients need general anesthesia in relation to dental visits robust educational material for the 
caregivers is put in place as emphasized by the experts which is considered to control sufficiently for this risk. 
Chronic use  
The data submitted may support short-term treatment but there are limited long term data (24 weeks and 
controlled data only 12 weeks). Since the substance is well known it is reasonable to believe that the long 
term adverse events relating to the anticholinergic effect are similar to those seen in more short term. 
However, other potential long term safety concerns are less well characterized (see ground 2). For this 
reasons the CHMP considers that the treatment should be applied only short term as outlined in the SmPC. 
Deficiencies in robust long-term data and the long term benefit risk were also acknowledged by the experts 
who emphasized however that needs should be seen in the context of the severity of the disease. 
Reassurance that patients are given the most appropriate dose with the recommended titration scheme 
would make sense which may be covered by a drug utilisation study. The experts further emphasized that 
expert prescription would be crucial taking into consideration comorbidities and co-medication of these 
patients and that a definite restriction of the duration of use should be avoided since treatment is highly 
individualized in clinical practice.  
Taken together the submitted data and the experts advice the CHMP considered that the safety profile 
remains insufficiently characterized for chronic use in all grades of severity of siallorhea and the application of 
the treatment was restricted to short -term intermittent use in severe cases. The safety characterization in 
this setting can be considered acceptable considering the submitted data and the statements in the SmPC on 
keeping total treatment duration as short as possible. However in a palliative care setting where the duration 
of treatment is limited due to the terminal disease state different benefit risk considerations apply and a 
continuous treatment can be considered by the treating expert prescriber who carefully monitors the patient 
as outlined in the SmPC. 
Conclusion on Ground 1 Taking into consideration the side effect profile of Sialanar which is typical for the 
anticholinergic action of the drug and the expert advice received the CHMP considers that careful titration of 
the dose by the treating physician together with robust guidance on the identification and management of 
side effects can minimize the expected risks associated with the use of GP in severely affected patient. The 
following considerations play a critical role to be confident that the safety of these patients can be balanced 
and the safety profile be considered to be sufficiently characterized in the patients comprised by the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016

indication: 
- The treatment is to be applied short term-intermittently only and the SmPC informs the treating physician 
that the treatment duration should be kept as short as possible which takes account the limited data in the 
long term setting. In the palliative care setting, more flexibility is foreseen. 
- The benefit of the patient to control drooling in the severely affected population can be considered highly 
clinically relevant as it reduces beside psychological consequences the risk of reflux and aspiration. In this 
situation a favorable impact on the QoL of the patients can be anticipated. 
- The most significant side effects such as urinary retention, constipation, cardiovascular and CNS effects 
were considered by the ad hoc experts to be either a consequence of inadequate dosing and manageable with 
an appropriate titration schedule or acceptable in the context of severe siallorhea under control of an expert 
prescriber. 
- Parents of affected patients were considered by the ad hoc expert group to be in general very skillful to 
interpret their non-verbal communication and eager to seek information about the well-being of their 
children. This adds certainty into the effectiveness of easily understandable and readable educational material 
which will be made available.  
As outlined in the SmPC the dose should not be increased by the caregivers without specialist consultation 
and further assurance that the approved titration scheme will be applied will be given in a DUS as described 
in the RMP. Patients / caregivers will be informed how to interpret indirect symptoms and how to take 
appropriate actions such as stopping the treatment if relevant side effects occur. This is combined with  close 
monitoring by the treating physician who is instructed by the SmPC to consider carefully the benefits and 
risks of the patient   should treatment be needed repeated intermittently or longer term in the palliative care 
setting. Based on these considerations, adaptations of the label and in particular based on the input of the ad 
hoc experts the CHMP concludes that the safety in the patients comprised by the label is sufficiently 
characterized for granting a marketing authorization. The indication was adapted to severely affected patients 
and to short term intermittent use

Ground #2 
Reference to data from the Product Monograph of Seebri Breezhaler is not considered to be acceptable. 
Seebri Breezhaler was approved 28/09/2012 and the data is therefore still protected based on the 8 year of 
data exclusivity applied within the European Union (EMA Procedural advice for users of the centralized 
procedure for generic/hybrid applications. Doc. Ref. EMEA/CHMP/225411/2006 December 2005). The data 
generated for Seebri Breezhaler can thus not be taken into account when assessing the present MAA without 
a letter of access from the marketing authorization holder. 
The three publications referred to (in addition to the monograph) are not considered to be sufficient to fully 
characterize reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity. Two of the publications are only short 
summaries, with only brief presentations of experimental details and results, and only the front page of the 
third publication, a book edited by Colin Dollery, has been submitted. (No assessment of the publication by 
Colin Dollery has therefore been made.)  
CHMP’s concern regarding repeat use toxicology and extrapolation of safety margins to the proposed 
population (chronic treatment of all severity grades of siallorhea) has not been resolved by the Applicant’s 
response. Therefore and also based on safety considerations described in ground 1 above the treatment

duration was restricted to short term-intermittent use. The CHMP took also into consideration that the safety 
profile was considered by the ad hoc experts to be predictable and manageable with the applied dose titration 
scheme, educational material and monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product as 
discussed at ground 1. The publications referred to by the applicant contain no data regarding genotoxicity or 
carcinogenicity and only a very brief presentation of reproductive toxicity data from one study in rats (see 
table below which contain all data presented) and a statement that “careful examination of offspring born to 
drug-treated rats revealed no abnormalities attributed to drug administration”. This was not considered to be 
sufficient for the claimed indication of chronic treatment of siallorhea in all grades of severity. 
Table 24 
The CHMP acknowledges however that clinical data from the CPRD do not show evidence that glycopyrronium 
causes reproductive or developmental toxicity and no evidence of a carcinogenic potential in this patient 
population. The presentations of the performed analysis of clinical data from the CPRD are very brief and not 
considered to be sufficient in order to make definite conclusions regarding possible reproductive or 
carcinogenic effects of glycopyrronium. No information regarding possible treatment of pregnant women is 
presented and it is also noted that the maximum length of treatment is stated to be below 8 years (92 
month, with only  62 treatment episodes ranging from 19 to 92 month). Whereas concerns on reproductive 
and developmental toxicity can be considered sufficiently addressed in this patient population with the 
inclusion of a contraindication in pregnancy / breast feeding women, requiring contraception where applicable 
and outlining the sparse non clinical data in 5.3 of the SmPC the CPRD data alone and the information 
included in the SmPC on the absence of appropriate non-clinical tests alone cannot be considered to be a 
sufficient basis for conclusions regarding a possible carcinogenic potential of glycopyrronium or giving 
sufficient basis for the management of this risk.  A carcinogenic potential of GP has not been reported within 
the therapeutic class. Nevertheless, in the absence of dedicated studies with Sialanar, this uncertainty 
remains acknowledged by the committee and control and reduction of exposure taking into consideration the 
individual patients profile is needed. This is now addressed in the SmPC by the short-term intermittent use 
and the monitoring of the benefit risk profile by the treating physician should repeated treatment be needed.

It appears that the use of the substance in the European Union in the intended indication has been limited, 
except  in  the  United  Kingdom,  where  the  Applicant  provided  the  following  evidence  of  use:  It  has  been 
included  in  the  British  National  Formulary  for  Children  (BNFc)  for  the  past  10  years;  Direct  evidence  from 
prescription cost analysis (PCA) data for 15 years and feedback from individual prescribers to support its use 
for longer than 10 years within the UK in the claimed indication was submitted. In addition, the Applicant was 
able  to  show  a  considerably  high  number  of  prescriptions  for  drooling  or  related  disorders,  calculated  from 
the  UK  database  Clinical  Practice  Research  Datalink  (CPRD).  Detailed  information  such  as  age,  diagnoses, 
medical  history  and  medication  history  were  also  provided.  A  total  of  428  children  from  the  CPRD  database 
were identified as treated with GP for pathological drooling due to neurological disorders in the period 2006-
2015.When  taking  into  account  the  prevalence  of  the  condition,  the  CHMP  considered  this  evidence  as 
sufficient to meet the quantitative requirements for well-established in the EU. 
In  order  to  substantiate  the  scientific  interest,  the  Applicant  provided  a  comprehensive  overview  of  the 
literature  published  world-wide  over  the  past  23  years  and  21  publications  where  identified,  most  of  them 
non-European, or did not provide detailed information of GP. The Applicant also provided proof of two clinical 
studies  conducted  in  the  EU:  a  double-blind,  randomised  placebo-controlled  study  investigating  an  oral 
solution  of  glycopyrronium  in  children  with  hypersalivation  associated  with  neurodevelopmental  disability 
(ongoing  in  Slovakia  and  Czech  Republic)  and  a  single-blind  study  comparing  an  oral  solution  of 
glycopyrronium with a hyoscine cutaneous patch in drooling in children with neurodisability (performed in the 
UK). Whilst these studies are not yet available in the published literature and do not provide detailed safety 
and  efficacy  information,  they  provide  valuable  information  on  current  clinical  development  of  this  active 
substance  in  the  claimed  indication.  Overall,  the  submitted  references  above  described  were  already 
considered sufficient evidence of scientific interest in the EU. 
Coherence of scientific assessments 
The  Applicant  provided  an  overview  of  the  publications  in  which,  overall,  the  reports  are  sufficiently 
consistent in outlining the effect of GP in pathological drooling in children, and therefore the CHMP considered 
that the coherence of the scientific assessments had been shown. 
As  a  conclusion  of  the  assessment  of  the  above  criteria,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  view  that  the  Applicant 
provided  sufficient  evidence  to  establish  that  the  elements  related  to  the  quantitative  aspects  of  the  use  of 
the substance, the time over which the substance has been used, the degree of scientific interest in the use 
of the substance in the EU and the coherence of the scientific assessments are fulfilled. However, in the first 
round, the CHMP considered that there was insufficient evidence to consider that GP has been used in the EU 
with an acceptable level of safety in the claimed indication.  
As  outlined  in  the  assessment  of  Ground  1#,  long-term  data  are  limited  and  although  overall  predictable 
based on the MoA, important uncertainties on the long term effects remain. Therefore the target population 
has been restricted to short term intermittent use in severely affected patients. Proof of an acceptable level 
of safety in this population has been addressed with ground 1 and 2. There is confirmed clinical use in severe 
Sialorrhoea.  Most  of  the  publications  are  for  severe  drooling  and  the  well-established  use  in  the  restricted 
patient population can be agreed.  
With regards to efficacy the Applicant summarized information from the pivotal submitted publications, 
supporting that children with severe drooling (as defined by the modified Teacher´s Drooling Scale) were 
included and also constituted the majority of the patients in the studies. 
Zeller, 2012a was an 8 week placebo controlled study in patients with severe drooling (mTDS score of 6 or 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 120/143 
  
  
 
 
 
 
higher, which defines a severe and profuse population). The responder rate was significantly higher for 
glycopyrronium treated patients (14/19; 73.7%) compared to placebo (3/17; 17.6%) p=0.0011. At 8 weeks 
the mean improvements in mTDS score at week 8 were 3.94 points for GP compared to 0.71 for placebo 
(p<0.0001).  
Mier, 2000 conducted an 8 week placebo controlled study in children with severe and profuse drooling, as 
reflected in the mean baseline drooling scores or 7.52 for glycopyrronium and 7.44 for placebo. Scores 
improved over the 8-week study from 7.52 to a max mean score of 1.85 (dry, never drools and mild 
drooling) in the glycopyrronium group and from 7.44 to 6.33 in the placebo group. Although data were not 
dicomised by severity of the condition at baseline, the study results are considered relevant to the restricted 
population as this was well represented.  Zeller 2012b5 conducted an open-label 24 week safety study which 
recorded efficacy from baseline. Of the study population, 68.2% of children had baseline drooling severe or 
profuse in nature. A moderate severity was recorded in 32.1% of children. Results show that the treatment is 
most effective in the profuse (31.6% to 2.3%) and severe (36.6% to 8.3%) populations. By the end of the 
study the number of children with profuse and severe drooling decreased from 31.6% to 2.3% and 36.6% to 
8.3%, respectively. The improvement in the moderate population was less, 32.1% to 25.6%. Parr 20166, 
conducted a 12 week comparator-controlled (hyoscine) study in which children had moderate or severe 
drooling. The breakdown of the drooling scores is not currently available. Glycopyrronium was found to have 
equivalent efficacy to hyoscine over the 12-week study in terms of drooling impact score. 
The overall benefit of treatment in these patients should also take into account prevention of potential 
serious risks associated with severe drooling and the secondary predictable improvement in QoL. Therefore, 
efficacy is considered well substantiated also in the subset of patients with severe drooling.  
Safety was not presented by severity, but since patients with severe drooling constitute an important portion 
of the main studies, results are considered representative and supportive of the safety in the subgroup of 
patients.  Thus, the submitted data is considered as relevant also for the children with severe drooling.  
Point resolved 
Ground #4 
Data indicate an effect on QoL as 100% of caregivers in the Zeller 2012a study assessed that the treatment 
was worthwhile as compared with placebo 56.3%.  
Even though there is very limited published data with respect to improvement of QoL associated with GP 
treatment, the experts at the SAG meeting confirmed that excessive drooling as seen in severe cases is 
significantly impacting the patients and treatment is an important element of patient care. Aspiration was 
considered as one of the most important consequences of severe drooling. In severely affected patients the 
control of potential reflux in children heavily choking was considered critical to alleviate distress.  
Treatment approaches to pathological drooling vary from country to country and depend on the severity of 
the condition. In the UK and in Belgium, GP (or Hyoscine patches) are in regular use particularly in the 
palliative care setting given continuously in patients with progressive disease and at the end of life.  Whereas 
Hyoscine patches carry the advantage of easier application, oral GP can be titrated more easily. Together 
with Botulinum toxin injections physicians choose from this armamentarium depending on treatment 
response of the individual patient. 
An age adapted oral formulation of GP would allow dose titration which would help to individualize the 
treatment in particular for severely affected patients who are often treated with numerous drugs.

Considering the indication being adapted to severe cases where the treatment of sialorrhoea can be used to 
alleviate distress an improvement of QoL can be expected.

5.1.  Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP considered that the risk management plan version 1.5 could be acceptable if the applicant 
implemented changes to the educational materials and submitted a synopsis for a drug utilisation study. In 
addition, changes relating to the overall quality of the content of the document were made.  
The applicant implemented most of the changes in the RMP as requested by CHMP in version 1.9. However, 
the RMP could benefit from further improvement and, therefore, the company is requested to submit a new 
version of the RMP two months after Commission Decision for a stand-alone assessment.

conducted in discussion with the carer to assess both 
efficacy and undesirable effects until an acceptable 
maintenance dose is achieved.  
Undesirable effects may be minimised by using the 
lowest effective dose necessary to control symptoms. It 
is important that the carer checks the dose volume in 
the syringe before administration. The maximum volume 
of the highest dose is 6ml. In the event of a known 
anticholinergic adverse event occurring when the dose is 
increased, the dose should be reduced to the previous 
lower dose and the event monitored. If the event does 
not resolve treatment should be discontinued. In the 
event of constipation, urinary retention or pneumonia 
treatment should be stopped until the event resolves. 
Younger children may be more susceptible to adverse 
events and this should be borne in mind when any dose 
adjustments are carried out. 
Following the dose titration period, the child’s 
sialorrhoea should be monitored, in conjunction with the 
carer, to assess changes in efficacy and/or tolerability 
over time, and the dose adjusted accordingly. 
Overdose section 4.9 of the SmPC states: 
Symptoms Overdose of glycopyrronium can result in 
anticholinergic syndrome, produced by the inhibition of 
cholinergic neurotransmission at muscarinic receptor 
sites. Clinical manifestations are caused by CNS effects, 
peripheral nervous system effects, or both. Common 
manifestations include flushing, dry skin and mucous 
membranes, mydriasis with loss of accommodation, 
altered mental status and fever. Additional 
manifestations include sinus tachycardia, decreased 
bowel sounds, functional ileus, urinary retention, 
hypertension, tremulousness and myoclonic jerking.  
Management Patients presenting with anticholinergic 
toxicity should be transported to the nearest emergency 
facility with advanced life support capabilities. Pre-
hospital gastrointestinal decontamination with activated 
charcoal is not recommended because of the potential 
for somnolence and seizures and the resulting risk of

Interactions with other 
medicinal products 
If you forget to give Sialanar 
Give the next dose when it is due. Do not give a double 
dose to make up for the forgotten dose.  
Contraindication in Section 4.3 of the SmPC: 
Concomitant treatment with (see section 4.5); 
potassium chloride solid oral dose; anticholinergics; 
Interactions in section 4.5 of the SmPC: There are 
limited data available relating to interactions with other 
medicinal products in the paediatric age group. The 
following drug interaction information is relevant to 
glycopyrronium. 
Contraindications of concomitant use 
Concomitant use of the following medicinal products is 
contraindicated (see section 4.3): 
Potassium chloride solid oral dose: glycopyrronium may 
potentiate the risk of upper gastrointestinal injury 
associated with oral solid formulations of potassium 
chloride due to increased gastrointestinal transit time 
creating a high localized concentration of potassium 
ions. An association with upper GI bleeding and small 
bowel ulceration, stenosis, perforation, and obstruction 
has been observed.  
Anticholinergics: anticholinergics may delay the 
gastrointestinal absorption of other anticholinergics 
administered orally and increase the risk of 
anticholinergic side effects. 
Concomitant use to be considered with caution 
Concomitant use of the following medicinal products 
should be considered with caution 
Antispasmodics: glycopyrronium may antagonize the 
pharmacologic effects of gastrointestinal prokinetic 
active substances such as domperidone and 
metoclopramide.  
Topiramate: glycopyrronium may potentiate the effects 
of oligohidrosis and hyperthermia associated with the 
use of topiramate, particularly in pediatric patients; 
Sedating antihistamines: may have additive 
anticholinergic effects. A reduction in anticholinergic 
and/or antihistamine dosage may be necessary; 
Neuroleptics/antipsychotics: the effects of active 
substances such as phenothiazines, clozapine and 
haloperidol may be potentiated. A reduction in 
anticholinergic and/or neuroleptic/antipsychotic dose 
may be necessary; 
Skeletal muscle relaxants: Use of anticholinergics after 
administration of botulinum toxin may potentiate 
systemic anticholinergic effects;

and/or tricyclic antidepressants and MAOIs dosage may 
be necessary. 
Opioids: active substances such as pethidine and 
codeine may result in additive central nervous system 
and gastrointestinal adverse effects, and increase the 
risk of severe constipation or paralytic ileus and CNS 
depression. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, 
patients should be monitored for potentially excessive or 
prolonged CNS depression and constipation; 
Corticosteroids: Steroid-induced glaucoma may develop 
with topical, inhaled, oral or intravenous, steroid 
administration. Concomitant use may result in increased 
intraocular pressure via an open- or a closed-angle 
mechanism;  
Nitrates: may decrease the dissolution of sublingual 
nitroglycerin by inducing dry mouth and decreased 
salivation resulting in a potential reduction in therapeutic 
effect;  
Other 
Medicinal products with anticholinergic properties (e.g. 
antihistamines, antidepressants) may cause a

mouth, urinary retention, constipation and confusion, 
and an increased risk of anticholinergic intoxication 
syndrome.  
Warning in Section 4.4 of the SmPC: Glycopyrronium 
should be used with caution in patients with acute 
myocardial infarction, hypertension, coronary artery 
disease, cardiac arrhythmias and conditions 
characterised by tachycardia (including thyrotoxicosis, 
cardiac insufficiency, cardiac surgery) due to the 
potential increase in heart rate, blood pressure and 
rhythm disorders produced by its administration. The 
carer should be advised to measure the pulse rate if the 
child seems unwell and report very fast or very slow 
heart rate. 
Undesirable effects in Section 4.8 of the SmPC 
Cardiac disorders. Glycopyrronium is known to have an 
effect on heart rate and blood pressure at doses used 
during anaesthesia although clinical trials in children 
with chronic drooling have not shown this effect. An 
effect on the cardiovascular system should be 
considered when assessing tolerability.

Due to the lack of long term safety data, Sialanar is 
recommended for short-term intermittent use (see 4.4) 
Warnings and precautions 4.4 of the SmPC: 
Lack of long-term safety data 
Published safety data are not available beyond 24 weeks 
treatment duration. Given the limited long-term safety 
data available and the uncertainties around the potential 
risk for carcinogenicity, total treatment duration should 
be kept as short as possible.  . If continuous treatment 
is needed (eg in a palliative setting) or the treatment is 
repeated intermittently (e.g. in the non palliative setting 
treating chronic disease) benefits and risks should be 
carefully considered on a case by case basis and 
treatment should be closely monitored”. 
Information in SmPC Section 5.1 
Pharmacodynamic Properties: The safety and 
efficacy of glycopyrronium bromide have been studied in 
an open labelled study with no control group over a 24-
week period in children aged 3 to 18 years. At the week 
24/exit visit, 52.3% (95% confidence interval 43.7–
60.9) of patients (n=130) had an at least three-point 
decrease in mTDS from baseline and were classified as 
responders to treatment with oral glycopyrrolate 
solution. The percentage of responders at week 24 was 
assessed relative to all intent-to-treat patients (n = 
137), except for seven patients with missing values. 
Patients who discontinued treatment due to lack of 
efficacy had their worst observation carried forward, 
whereas patients who discontinued due to any other 
reason had their last observation carried forward.  The 
adverse event profile seen with anticholinergics was 
demonstrated in children with chronic drooling. No new 
or different adverse events were seen.

6.  Benefit-risk balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The benefit of glycopyrronium in alleviating pathological drooling in children with neurological disorders has 
been demonstrated in two randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trials: The Zeller, 2012a study and the 
Mier, 2000 study. Both studies were short-term as the treatment duration was 8 weeks. 
The pivotal 8-week study in Zeller at al. 2012a conducted with thirty-eight patients demonstrated superiority 
of glycopyrrolate over placebo in reduction of drooling in children 3-16 years old: 
The initial dose was 0.02 mg/kg, which was increased in 0.02 m g/kg increments every 5 to 7 days up to a 
maximum dose of 0.1 mg/kg (but not to exceed a maximum dose of 3 mg t.i.d, regardless of weight). The 
responder rate at Week 8 (≥ 3 point improvement on the mTDS) was significantly higher for glycopyrrolate 
(14/19; 73.7%) than for placebo (3/17; 17.6%) (p = 0.0011), with improvements starting 2 weeks after 
treatment initiation (52.6% vs. 0%; p=0.00007). The favourable effects of GP on the mTDS were 
corroborated by results of investigator and patient/caregiver rated global assessments. Due to differences in 
relative bioavailability between Sialanar (approximately 25% higher bioavailability) and the product used in 
this trial the proposed titration scheme for Sialanar was adapted during the procedure to largely mirror 
exposure levels obtained during titration in this trial. 
Also the study by Mier et al. conducted in thirty-nine children aged 4 years and older with 
neurodevelopmental conditions and severe sialorrhoea demonstrated superiority of glycopyrrolate over 
placebo. Doses were increased in 0.6 mg increments in both groups but from different starting doses: 0.6 to 
2.4 mg in the lower weight group and 1.2 to 3.0 mg in the higher weight group. Drooling score on the mTDS 
improved in a linear manner with increasing dose level over the 4-week titration period; scores were 6.0 at 
dose level 1, 4.5 at level 2, 3.6 at level 3, and 2.6 at level 4. After an additional 4 weeks at the highest 
individual dose the mean drooling score had decreased further to 2.3. 
These two randomised, double-blind studies are supported by a long-term safety study by Zeller at al. 
2012b. In this 24-week, open-label study glycopyrrolate was administered to 137 paediatric patients between 
3-18 years of age. At Week 24, 52.3% (95% CI 43.7–60.9) of subjects were responders (≥ 3 point reduction 
on the mTDS). The proportion of responders ranged between 40.3% and 56.7% over the 6 assessment 
points during the 24 week study period. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
General uncertainties on the beneficial effects within this bibliographic application are deriving from the study 
design and the analysis/reporting of both the Zeller 2012a study and, in particular, the Mier study but do not 
lead to particular concerns. The main efficacy studies were performed with similar formulations of GP than 
Sialanar. The higher bioavailability of Sialanar compared to the product used in the pivotal Zeller studies 
(Zeller 2012a and Zeller 2012b) was addressed by revising the titration schedule for Sialanar, addressing the 
concern on the uncertainty on the applicability of the pivotal data to Sialanar.  
With regards to representation of the target population in the submitted studies, the Applicant has provided 
information from the pivotal submitted publications, supporting that children with severe drooling (as defined 
by the modified Teacher´s Drooling Scale; mTDS scores of 6 and above relate to severe and profuse 
Assessment report

Page 133/143 
  
  
drooling.) were included and also constituted the majority of the patients in the studies.In the Zeller, 2012a 
study, included patients had severe drooling (mTDS score of 6 or higher) and in the study by Mier, 2000, 
mean baseline drooling scores were 7.52 for glycopyrronium and 7.44 for placebo. In Zeller 2012b, 68.2% of 
children had baseline drooling  which was severe or profuse in nature. This provides sufficient certainty about 
the applicability of the efficacy data to the narrower indication of severely affected patients which was 
implemented during this re-examination procedure. 
The two placebo-controlled studies only investigated efficacy in the short-term and although the open-label 
study Zeller 2012b offers some reassurance about maintenance of the effect over 24 weeks maintenance of 
efficacy for long term or chronic use could not be fully substantiated by the available data. As advised by the 
ad hoc expert group the sparse long term data and the long-term benefit risk can, however, be weighed 
against the severity of the child sialorrhoea and the underlying disease and monitoring the effect on 
siallorhea following dose titration as now outlined in the SmPC takes due account of potential loss of efficacy 
should treatment be prolonged in the palliative care setting. Outside the palliative care setting Sialanar 
should only be given for short-term intermittent use as outlined in the SmPC.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The plasma concentration of GP required for effective vagolysis has been determined to be at least 10 μg/L. 
In studies in children by Rautokorpi et al, 1994 and Rautokorpi et al, 1998 plasma concentrations following a 
5 μg/kg i.v. dose of GP only briefly exceeded this concentration immediately following administration. In 
study PRO/GLY/001, the maximum plasma concentration after 2 mg (~0.03 mg/kg) of Sialanar in adult 
volunteers occurred between 3 and 7 hours post dose, reaching a maxima of ~1000 pg/mL (i.e. 1 μg/L). The 
highest dose of Sialanar (0.1 mg/kg) in the Applicant’s proposed posology is 3.3 fold higher than the average 
dose (in mg/kg terms) tested in PRO/GLY/001. It is therefore conceivable, given the variability in exposure to 
GP after oral administration, that some paediatric patients at the highest dose(s) may briefly attain a plasma 
concentration of GP sufficient to cause a vagolytic effect. The numbers of occurrences of cardiac events in 
CPRD were extremely low. To take due account of the remaining risk the SmPC informs about cardiac effects 
and outlines that effects on the cardiovascular system should be considered when assessing tolerability. 
Additionally robust educational material was established addressing this issue which is considered to be 
sufficient in this setting considering that the ad hoc expert group considered caretakers in general highly 
skilled to evaluate the well-being of their patients. 
GP passes the BBB in very limited amount except in situations where the BBB has been compromised e.g. by 
a shunt infection. However in the study of Mier there was a higher frequency of AEs related to CNS (23%) in 
the GP group compared to placebo. The Applicant points to that the dose in the Mier study was higher but 
still, this raises concern that some children treated have a more pronounced risk of transfer of GP into CNS. 
The main concern of the CHMP was that in the case of CNS adverse effects these may be difficult to assess 
for the caregiver and depending on the neurological disease with fluctuations of alertness can be difficult to 
distinguish from side effects of the medication.  
The ad hoc experts acknowledged that potential effect on CNS may be seen with the use of GP, but based on 
their experience this was not a common adverse event and may not be a serious problem in severely affected 
patients who are taking in general multiple medications with CNS effects and have a significant benefit with 
their drooling control. This was taken into consideration by the CHMP together with the expert’s view that 
caregivers / parents of these patients are highly skillful to detect changes in the behavior of their children.

Considering the narrower indication (severely affected patients) and the particular clinical benefit of these 
patients available data with respect to potential risk of CNS effect was considered as sufficient and a potential 
risk was considered acceptable with the warning included into the SmPC on CNS adverse effects and the 
established risk minimization measures.   
Another serious side effect is pneumonia and the data from Zeller 2012(b) suggests a causal relationship with 
GP. Therefore advice was added to SmPC and educational material that, should pneumonia occur, the 
treatment should be discontinued. The experts raised that inappropriate dosing of GP leads to thick mucus 
and pneumonia and that this risk can be considered manageable with careful titration.  Obstipation is a 
further side effect that may be severe in this setting of patients because this may also be a result of the low 
degree of physical activity in the patients. However, based on the deliberations of the experts this side effect 
is considered sufficiently detectable by a caregiver trained with adequate educational material if advised to be 
attentive to this risk.  
Based on the expert feedback the CHMP considers both, pneumonia (via over drying) and obstipation to be 
manageable by the trained and experience caregiver and prescriber as they are detectable and mostly results 
of inappropriate titration. This key problem is now sufficiently addressed by educational material and the 
planned DUS (as outlined in the RMP). Taking all this into consideration, the CHMP concluded that the 
submitted data referring to these adverse events is sufficient for an approval in the new target population. 
Urinary retention was reported with an incidence of 13-15% with GP in randomized controlled clinical studies 
whereas not occurring in the placebo arm and there was neither information provided on the severity of the 
episodes of urinary retention nor if it was associated with an increased incidence of urinary tract infections. 
This risk of urinary retention was acknowledged by the experts even though not commonly seen in the 
treated patients in clinical practice. The experts considered urinary retention sufficiently detectable by the 
caregivers (e.g. by urine diary) and manageable with careful titration of the drug by the treating physician 
together with robust guidance on the identification and management of side effects. The CHMP considers that 
taking into consideration the expert prescription, the caregivers which were seen as in general very skillful by 
the ad hoc experts in detecting side effects of their children, the recommendations given in the SmPC and in 
the educational material on careful titration and recommended action if side effects occur as sufficient to 
balance the risk of urinary retention. An age appropriate formulation of GP such as Sialanar may also 
facilitate titration as outlined by the expert. Furthermore the implemented DUS addresses further the 
underlying problem of inadequate titration which was stressed by the ad hoc experts. Together with the 
implemented short-term intermittent use and recommendations in the SmPC on considering carefully the 
benefit risk of the patient if treatment is repeated sufficient assurance is given on the control of this risk.  
Dry mouth is probably an inevitable side effect of GP as this is the effect that the treatment is aiming for. It is 
known that dry mouth is a severe risk factor for caries and a high level of mouth hygiene is necessary. As 
these patients need general anaesthesia in relation to dental visits robust educational material for the 
caregivers is put in place as emphasized by the experts which is considered to control sufficiently for this risk. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The data submitted support short-term treatment but there are limited long term data (24 weeks and 
controlled data only 12 weeks). Since the substance is well known it is reasonable to believe that the long 
term adverse events relating to the anticholinergic effect are similar to those seen in more short term. 
However, some potential long term safety concerns are less well characterized. 
CHMP’s concern regarding animal data on repeat use toxicology and extrapolation of safety margins to the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 135/143 
  
  
proposed population (chronic treatment of all severity grades of siallorhea) could only be addressed by the 
treatment duration restriction to short term-intermittent use. That no exposure data are available from 
repeated dose toxicology studies with glycopyrronium is also outlined in the SmPC to inform the prescriber. 
The CHMP took also into consideration that the safety profile was considered by the ad hoc experts to be 
predictable and manageable with the applied dose titration scheme, educational material and monitoring of 
the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. 
Submitted publications did not contain animal data regarding genotoxicity or carcinogenicity and only a very 
brief presentation of reproductive toxicity data from one study in rats showing no abnormalities attributed to 
drug administration in offspring. This was not considered to be acceptable for the claimed indication of 
chronic treatment of siallorhea in all grades of severity. The CHMP acknowledges that a carcinogenic potential 
of GP has not been reported within the therapeutic class and clinical data from the CPRD do not show 
evidence that glycopyrronium causes reproductive or developmental toxicity and also no evidence of a 
carcinogenic potential in this patient population. Nevertheless, in the absence of dedicated animal studies 
with Sialanar, this uncertainty was only considered acceptable with the recommendations of control and 
reduction of exposure taking into consideration the individual patients profile as outlined in the SmPC. 
Furthermore the short-term intermittent use and the monitoring of the benefit risk profile by the treating 
physician make this remaining uncertainty acceptable. 
Considering the short term intermittent use concerns on reproductive and developmental toxicity can also be 
considered sufficiently addressed in this patient population together with the inclusion of a contraindication in 
pregnancy / breast feeding women, requiring contraception where applicable and outlining the sparse non 
clinical data in 5.3 of the SmPC. 
Deficiencies in robust long-term data and the long term benefit risk were also acknowledged by the experts 
who emphasized however that needs should be seen in the context of the severity of the disease. Therefore 
in the palliative care situation due to the particular benefit risk profile of these patients continuous treatment 
can be considered as also in situation where treatment needs to be repeated intermittently. However benefits 
and risks should be carefully considered on a case by case basis and treatment should be closely monitored 
in this setting as outlined in the SmPC.  
No data was submitted in patients below the age of 3 and the safety profile for these patients remains to be 
inappropriately characterized.  The use in these patients is not recommended according to the SmPC however 
according to the experts, there may be particular circumstances such as at the end of live where 
Glycopyrronium may have a use in therapy for younger patients.

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The submitted data, together with the knowledge about the mechanism of action of GP, support that GP can 
reduce drooling in the proposed target population.  Even though there is limited published data with respect 
to improvement of QoL associated with GP treatment, the experts at the SAG meeting confirmed that 
excessive drooling as seen in severe cases is significantly impacting the patient´s quality of life and 
treatment is an important element of patient care. Aspiration was considered as one of the most important 
consequences of drooling. In severely affected patients the control of potential reflux in children heavily 
choking was considered critical to alleviate distress.  
Safety AEs are within those expected based on the anticholinergic mechanism of action and most side effects 
can be controlled ensuring adequate titration and monitoring of side effects by the experienced and trained 
carer together with the expert prescriber.  
In addition to a restriction in the target population, Sialanar is recommended to be prescribed and managed 
by specialists in the treatment of paediatric patients with neurological disorders, experienced in the treatment 
of these complex conditions.  
Appropriate information to warn physicians on the most relevant AEs has been included in the SmPC in order 
to prevent and/or minimise these risks. The potential for clinically relevant cardiovascular effects is 
considered low and manageable with careful titration of the dose by the expert prescriber monitoring the 
patient.  Also potential side effects such as urinary retention and pneumonia appears to be associated with 
inadequate titration of GP and the product information and the educational material for the expert prescriber 
as well as for the caregivers are taking due account of this. Furthermore a drug utilization study was included 
into the RMP to confirm an appropriate application of the recommended titration schedule. 
CNS effects have been reported with GP but according to the ad hoc experts they are weighed in their 
significance in the targeted patient population against the clearly clinical relevant effect of the control of 
severe drooling.   
Benefit-risk balance 
The Benefit-risk balance is considered to be positive. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Different treatment approaches to pathological drooling exist varying from country to country and depending 
on the severity of the condition. Speech therapy is usually the first treatment in mild to moderate conditions, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/436684/2016 
Page 138/143 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
but in more severe cases, medical treatment may be indicated. Anticholinergs (Glycopyrronium or Hyoscine 
patches) are in use in some countries. Together with Botulinustoxin injections physicians choose from this 
armamentarium depending on treatment response of the individual patient. According to the experts 
attending the SAG meeting, an age adapted oral formulation of GP would also allow better dose titration 
helping to individualize the treatment in particular for severely affected patients who are often treated with 
numerous drugs. In view of the restrictions in the target population to severe siallorhea, the restriction of use 
to short term and the limitation of exposure the risk profile of Sialanar is considered to be acceptable in view 
of the clearly clinical relevant effects of the control of drooling. 
Finally it is considered that use of the substance in symptomatic treatment of severe sialorrhoea (chronic 
pathological drooling) in children and adolescents aged 3 years and older with chronic neurological disorders 
has been well-established in the European Union for at least 10 years with recognised efficacy and an 
acceptable level of safety as required for a marketing authorisation application under Article 10a of Directive 
2001/83/EC. 
7.  Recommendations following re-examination 
Based on the arguments of the applicant and all the supporting data on quality, safety and efficacy, the 
CHMP re-examined its initial opinion and in its final opinion concluded by majority decision that the risk-
benefit balance of Sialanar in the Symptomatic treatment of severe sialorrhoea (chronic pathological 
drooling) in children and adolescents aged 3 years and older with chronic neurological disorders is favourable 
and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
• 
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to launch of Sialanar in each Member State, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) must agree 
about the content and format of the educational materials, including communication media, distribution 
modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with the National Competent Authority.  
The objectives of the programme are:  
• 
• 
to provide information on the administration of Sialanar, specifically on the accurate use of the 
prescribed dosing, the time of administration before the meals, the avoidance of the administration of 
Sialanar with high fat meals, use of the oral syringe and the need to complete the administration 
table at the end of the reminder card for patient's carer to remind the carer of the correct dose to be 
given to the child.  
to provide information on the management and minimisation of anticholinergic reactions, especially 
on management of constipation, urinary retention, pneumonia, risk of overheating, CNS effects or 
overdose; and on allergic reactions. In addition, the materials should highlight the difficulty of the 
detection of anticholinergic reactions in the treated population and the need to decrease the dose to 
the previous one in case of suspicion of adverse drug reactions and contact the physician. The 
materials should also cover the need to avoid exposure to hot weather and overheating; risk of caries 
associated to reduced salivation and need for regular dental hygiene and dental checks and the 
requirement to check the pulse at regular intervals.  
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where Sialanar is marketed, all healthcare professionals and 
patients/carers who are expected to prescribe, dispense or use Sialanar have access to or are provided with 
the following educational packages:  
• 
The physician educational material should contain:  
o  The Summary of Product Characteristics 
o 
Information about the drug utilisation study to monitor and assess effectiveness of additional risk 
minimisation measures for anticholinergic side effects that may be dose dependent and the 
importance of contributing to such a study

DIVERGENT POSITION DATED 21 JULY 2016  
Sialanar EMEA/H/C/003883 
The undersigned members of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion recommending the 
granting of the marketing authorisation for Sialanar indicated for symptomatic treatment of severe 
sialorrhoea (chronic pathological drooling) in children and adolescents aged 3 years and older with chronic 
neurological disorders. 
The reasons for divergent opinion were the following: 
• 
The overall safety and tolerability profile of Sialanar in the target population has not appropriately been 
characterised.  There  is  insufficiently  detailed  safety  data  as  well  as  long-term  safety  data.  There  are 
significant safety concerns due to the aimed chronic use of Sialanar in the paediatric population affected 
by  the  underlying  conditions,  in  particular  on  the  risks  of  cardiovascular  effect,  developmental  effects, 
urinary  retention  and  CNS  effects.  These  uncertainties  are  a  major  concern  in  view  of  the  target 
population,  which  cannot  be  addressed  adequately  by  a  reduction  of  the  duration  of  treatment  due  to 
the  chronicity  of  the  underlying  conditions  or  by  warnings  and  precaution  statements  in  the  Product 
Information. 
• 
The lack of adequate non-clinical data in support of the claimed indication. 
In view of the above considerations the undersigned delegates consider the benefit risk of this product to be 
negative.

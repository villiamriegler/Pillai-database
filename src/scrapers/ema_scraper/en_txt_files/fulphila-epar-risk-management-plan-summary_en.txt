SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
Summary of Risk Management Plan for Fulphila® (pegfilgrastim) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Fulphila®. The RMP details important 
risks  of  pegfilgrastim,  how  these  risks  can  be  minimised,  and  how  more  information  will  be 
obtained about pegfilgrastim' s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Fulphila®’s  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  give  essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how it should be used. 
This  summary  of  the  RMP  for  Fulphila®  should  be  read  in  the  context  of  all  the  information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part 
of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Fulphila®’s 
RMP. 
The Medicine and What it is Used For 
Fulphila® is authorised for Reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile 
neutropenia  in  adult  patients  treated  with  cytotoxic  chemotherapy  for  malignancy  (with  the 
exception  of  chronic  myeloid  leukaemia  and  myelodysplastic  syndromes).  It  contains 
pegfilgrastim as the active substance and it is given by pre-filled syringes each containing 6 mg of 
pegfilgrastim in 0.6 ml solution for injection. The concentration is 10 mg/ml based on protein only. 
The concentration is 20 mg/ml if the PEG moiety is included. 
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  Fulphila®’s  benefits  can  be  found  in  Fulphila®’s 
EPAR,  including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA  website,  under  the 
medicine’s webpage: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/fulphila-0. 
Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further Characterise the 
Risks 
Important risks of Fulphila®, together with measures to minimise such risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
• 
•  The authorised pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the public (e.g. with or without 
prescription) can help to minimises its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
 
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  events  is  collected  continuously  and 
regularly  analysed,  including  PSUR  assessment,  so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important  risks  of  Fulphila®  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate  or  minimise  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  administered  to 
patients. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Fulphila®. Potential risks are concerns for 
which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. 
Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine/use in special patient 
populations etc.).

Risk Factors and Risk Groups 
Important Identified Risk: Capillary leak syndrome 
Evidence for Linking the Risk to the Medicine  Based  on  the  published  literature  data  and  in 
line  with  the  RMP  for  the  reference  product, 
this  safety  concern  has  been  classified  as  an 
important identified risk. 
The cases of capillary leak syndrome reported 
in association with the reference product have 
generally  occurred  in  patients  with  advanced 
malignant  diseases,  sepsis,  taking  multiple 
chemotherapy  medications  or  undergoing 
apheresis.1

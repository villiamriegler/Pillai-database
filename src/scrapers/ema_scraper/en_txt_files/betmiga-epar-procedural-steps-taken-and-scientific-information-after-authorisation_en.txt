1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

n/a 
The MAH submitted with this variation the final results of 
An evaluation of Cardiovascular Events in Users of 
Mirabegron and Other Treatments for Overactive 
Bladder. 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
the Post-Authorisation Safety Study 178-CL-114. This study 
was conducted to investigate the cardiovascular events of 
mirabegron (especially in elderly). The results of the study 
did not find higher risk of MACE, AMI, stroke, CV mortality 
or all-cause mortality among current users of mirabegron 
as compared to current users of antimuscarinic 
medications, and the Committee agreed there was no need 
to update the product information. RMP, version 8.0 was 
updated to reflect the completion of the study and to bring 
it in line with GVP rev.2 template.

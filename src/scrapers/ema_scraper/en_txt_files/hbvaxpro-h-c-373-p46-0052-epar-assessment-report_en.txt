1.  Assessment 
1.1.  Introduction 
This final report of a paediatric study P46 052 was submitted in accordance with Article 46 of 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 of the European Parliament: 
P46 052 is “an open-label, randomised, controlled, multicentre study of the immunogenicity and 
safety of a booster dose of two different hepatitis b vaccines [HBVAXPRO, 5 µg (modified process) 
versus Engerix-B, 10 µg) to explore the anamnestic immune response in healthy 4 to 7 year-old 
children previously vaccinated at about 3, 5 and 11 to 13 months of age with either HEXAVAC or 
INFANRIX-HEXA “. 
2.  STUDY DESIGN: 
This study was designed to describe the Hepatitis B antibody responses after a booster dose of 2 
different Hepatitis B vaccines licensed for children and adolescents from birth through 15 years of age: 
HBVaxPRO or ENGERIX-B 10 μg. 
This study was open-label and conducted in 2 parts: 
Part I 
•  28 to 42 days of the study. All subjects participated to Part I of the study. At inclusion (Visit 1), 
within each hexavalent vaccine group (HEXAVAC or INFANRIX-HEXA Group), subjects were 
randomly assigned a booster dose of either HBVaxPRO 5 μg (modified process) or ENGERIX-B 
10 μg. 
The planned sample size was 668 subjects, i.e. 167 subjects in each of the 4 subgroups. 
Part II 
•  Children with an anti-HBs antibody titre <10 mIU/mL and being negative for anti-HBc antibody 
titre 1 month after the booster dose, as measured at Laboratorio Epatite, Università degli 
Studi di Milano, Italy, were proposed to continue to Part II of the study by receiving one or 
two extra-dose of a Hepatitis B vaccine, HBVaxPRO 5 μg (modified process) or ENGERIX-B 10 
μg.

−  3 months for children with an anti-HBs antibody titre <10 mIU/mL and negative for anti-
HBc antibody titre 1 month after the booster dose and who accepted to be further 
vaccinated with one extra-dose of a Hepatitis B vaccine 
−  7 months for children with an anti-HBs antibody titre <10 mIU/mL 1 month after the first 
extra-dose and who accepted to be further vaccinated with a second extra-dose of a 
Hepatitis B vaccine 
3.  STUDY OBJECTIVES

6.  STATISTICAL METHODS 
This study was descriptive. Data were summarised and no formal hypothesis was tested. 
The immunogenicity analysis was performed on a Per Protocol Set (main analysis) and on a Full 
Analysis Set (supportive analysis) according to the results provided by PPD Vaccines and Biologics LLC, 
USA. 
Descriptive statistics were provided for all 4 groups. In addition for immunogenicity, statistics were 
provided for the HEXAVAC Group (Groups 1A and 1B pooled) and the INFANRIX-HEXA Group (Groups 
2A and 2B pooled); for safety, statistics were provided for the HBVaxPRO 5 μg (modified process) 
Group (Groups 1A and 2A pooled) and for the ENGERIX-B 10 μg Group (Groups 1B and 2B pooled). 
Assessor’s comments: 
The current study is part of a post-suspension FUM originally requested to address the issue of long-
term protection raised for HEXAVAC. 
The design of this study was noted (in critical expert overview) to be agreed with EMA on December 
2006. 
7.  RESULTS: 
7.1.  Disposition of Subjects 
In total 410 subjects were included, including 62 in Groups 1A and 2A and 348 in 1B and 2B (Table 2). 
Inclusions in Groups 1A and 2A were stopped at the time of HBVaxPRO 5 μg (modified process) expiry. 
Assessment report under Article 46  
EMA/480078/2014  
Page 5/14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Number of subjects Analysed: The Full Analysis Set consisted of 401 subjects (97.8%): 195 
subjects in Group 1 and 206 subjects in Group 2. The Per Protocol Set consisted of 391 subjects 
(95.4%): 193 subjects in Group 1 and 198 subjects in Group 2. The Safety Analysis Set consisted of 
407 subjects (99.3%): 198 subjects in Group 1 and 209 subjects in Group 2. 
Assessor’s Comments: 
The number of subjects receiving HBVaxPRO 5 μg (modified process) was less than initially planned 
(i.e. 167 subjects for each of 1A and 2A groups). 
It was claimed to be due to the shortage of this vaccine. After HBVaxPRO 5 μg (modified process) 
expiry date, randomisation was stopped and all subjects received ENGERIX-B 10 μg. 
The impact of using a reduced sample size on data analysis (especially immunogenicity comparison) 
might be limited, based on relatively small variation of the primary endpoint (narrowed post-challenge 
confidence intervals); however, it does preclude a better characterisation of the safety profile for this 
booster/challenge dose with HBVAXPRO in this age range of 4 – 7 years. 
All recruited subjects got vaccinated. Endpoint analysis was performed with most of the recruited and 
vaccinated subjects. The drop-out rate among vaccinated subjects was very low. 
7.2.  Demography 
Groups were comparable in terms of age at booster, weight, height and the time interval between the 
last hexavalent vaccine and the booster dose. Same results were observed in the Per Protocol Set and 
the Full Analysis Set.

7.3.  Immunogenicity results 
Part I 
Primary immunogenicity analysis 
• 
The post-booster rates of subjects with an anti-HBs antibody titre >=10 mIU/mL were 90.9% 
and 91.3% in the HEXAVAC groups (pooled for Group 1: 91.2%) and were 100% and 97.7% in 
the two INFANRIX-HEXA groups (pooled for Group 2: 98.0%) following HBVaxPRO and 
ENGERIX-B, respectively (see Table 3). Similar results were observed in the Full Analysis Set. 
Secondary immunogenicity analyses 
• 
The pre-booster rates of subjects with an anti-HBs antibody titre >=10 mIU/mL were 39.6% in 
the HEXAVAC Group and 81.3% in the INFANRIX-HEXA Group. The post-booster response 
rates were 92.2% in the HEXAVAC Group and 98.5% in the INFANRIX-HEXA Group at the level 
of 5 mIU/mL, and 82.9% in the HEXAVAC Group and 95.5% in the INFANRIX-HEXA Group at 
the level of 100 mIU/mL. The booster dose of HBVaxPRO or ENGERIX-B provided comparable 
response rates within each HEXAVAC and INFANRIX-HEXA Group (see Table 3). 
Similar results were observed in the Full Analysis Set. 
The pre-booster GMTs were 9 mIU/mL in the HEXAVAC Group and 59 mIU/mL in the INFANRIX-HEXA 
Group. The post-booster GMTs ranged from 1255 to 878 mIU/mL in the two HEXAVAC groups (pooled 
for Group 1: 934 mIU/mL), and from 6564 to 7420 mIU/mL in the two INFANRIX-HEXA groups (pooled

for Group 2: 7297 mIU/mL) following HBVaxPRO and ENGERIX-B, respectively. The GMTRs ranged 
from 100 to 111 in the two HEXAVAC groups and from 122 to 131 in the two INFANRIX-HEXA groups. 
The booster dose of HBVaxPRO or ENGERIX-B provided comparable GMTs and GMTRs within each 
HEXAVAC and INFANRIX-HEXA Group (see Table 4). Similar results were observed in the Full Analysis 
Set. 
Assessor’s comments: 
Group 1A but not Group 2A contained a slightly higher percentage of subjects with pre-booster anti-
HBs antibodies >=5 mIU/ml, >=10 mIU/ml, >=100 mIU/ml, as compared to its own control group. 
This finding doesn’t appear to affect the conclusion that HBVAXPRO is comparable to Engerix-B with 
respect to immunogenicity in this study. 
However, the overall pre-booster data in Table 3 suggest that after primary vaccination series, 
HEXAVAC achieved significantly lower anti-HBs response than INFANRIX-HEXA (47.9% vs 83.8% at > 
= 5 mIU/ml;  39.6% vs 81.3% at > = 10 mIU/ml;  6.3% vs 42.9% at > = 100 mIU/ml. This finding 
may suggest that children previously vaccinated with HEXAVAC may have increased risk of hepatitis B 
virus infection than children vaccinated with INFANRIX-HEXA. 
A post-hoc analysis was performed on the subsets of subjects with a pre-booster anti-HBs titre <10 
and >=10 mIU/mL. Subjects with a pre-booster anti-HBs titre <10 mIU/mL had post-booster GMTs at 
284 mIU/mL in the HEXAVAC Group and 339 mIU/mL in INFANRIX-HEXA Group, and GMTRs at 97 in 
the HEXAVAC Group and 118 in the INFANRIX-HEXA Group. The rates of subjects with an anti-HBs 
>=10 mIU/mL were 85.3% in the HEXAVAC Group and 91.9% in the INFANRIX-HEXA Group. All of the 
subjects with a pre-booster anti-HBs titre >=10 mIU/mL had a post-booster titre >=100 mIU/mL, 
except one subject in the INFANRIX-HEXA Group (see Table 5).

All of the subjects who received one or two extra-dose(s) of hepatitis b vaccine achieved an anti-
HBs antibody titer >= 10 mIU/ml, except two subjects in the HEXAVAC group 
In each HEXAVAC and INFANRIX-HEXA Group, the booster dose of HBVaxPRO 5 μg (modified 
process) or ENGERIX-B 10 μg stimulated comparable immune responses.

Part II 
• 
Fifteen (15) subjects continued in Part II of the study, 14 in the HEXAVAC Group and 1 in the 
INFANRIX-HEXA Group, and received one extra-dose of a Hepatitis B vaccine. One subject, in 
Group 1A, received HBVaxPRO and the other subjects received ENGERIX-B. Three out of the 15 
subjects, all in the HEXAVAC Group, received a second extra-dose of ENGERIX-B. 
•  All of the subjects who received one or two extra-dose(s) of Hepatitis B vaccine achieved an 
anti-HBs antibody titre >=10 mIU/mL, except two subjects in the HEXAVAC Group: one 
subject had an anti-HBs antibody titre at 6.5 mIU/mL following the first extra-dose of 
ENGERIX-B 10 μg and did not receive a second extra-dose (as it was tested at 10.5 mIU/mL by 
the Italian Lab following the first extra-dose), and one subject remained seronegative (<5 
mIU/mL) after the second extra-dose of ENGERIX-B 10 μg 
Assessor’s comments: 
The finding of 14 out of 15 subjects who were in HEXAVAC groups and did not achieve a protective 
titer of 10 mIU/ml after the booster/challenge dose, either with HBVAXPRO or Engerix-B, is interesting, 
and is consist with the finding that vaccination with HEXAVAC achieved significantly lower anti-HBs 
responses than INFANRIX-HEXA, as suggested by overall pre-booster data presented in Table 3 and 
Table 4. 
From Part I: The pre-booster rates of subjects with an anti-HBs antibody titre >=10 mIU/mL were 
39.6% in the HEXAVAC Group versus 81.3% in the INFANRIX-HEXA Group. The pre-booster GMTs 
were 9 mIU/mL in the HEXAVAC Group versus 59 mIU/mL in the INFANRIX-HEXA Group. 
7.4.  Safety results 
Part I (see Table 6) 
From Day 0 to Day 14, 24.2% of subjects reported injection-site adverse reactions and 24.2% 
systemic adverse events in the HBVaxPRO 5 μg (modified process) Group, and 31.6% and 19.4% in 
the ENGERIX-B 10 μg Group, respectively. 
All injection-site adverse reactions occurred between Day 0 and Day 4 and all were solicited (namely 
injection-site erythema, pain and swelling), except 3 in the ENGERIX-B 10 μg Group (injection-site 
haemorrhage, irritation and pruritus). 
In the ENGERIX-B Group, children previously vaccinated with INFANRIX-HEXA presented more solicited 
injection-site adverse reactions (total: 37.6%, erythema: 8.8%, pain: 32.6%, swelling: 7.2%) than 
those previously vaccinated with HEXAVAC (total: 24.4%, erythema: 1.2%, pain: 23.2%, swelling: 
1.8%), with a non-overlap of the confidence intervals for injection-site erythema only. The sample 
sizes of the two HBVaxPRO groups were too small (34 and 28 subjects, respectively) to allow any 
meaningful safety analysis. In both groups, most injection-site adverse reactions were of mild intensity 
or with a size <2.5 cm and lasted 3 days or less. 
Few subjects reported solicited systemic adverse events (i.e. pyrexia) between Day 0 and Day 4: 6.5% 
(vaccine-related: 1 subject [1.6%]) in the HBVaxPRO 5 μg (modified process) Group and 3.2% 
Assessment report under Article 46  
EMA/480078/2014  
Page 10/14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(vaccine-related: 6 subjects [1.7%]) in the ENGERIX-B 10 μg Group. Similarly, few subjects reported 
unsolicited systemic adverse events between Day 0 and Day 14: 21.0% (vaccine-related: 1 subject 
[1.6%]) in the HBVaxPRO 5 μg (modified process) Group and 17.4% (vaccine-related: 8 subjects 
[2.3%]) in the ENGERIX-B 10 μg Group. 
Only one unsolicited systemic adverse event was reported with an incidence >=5% in at least one 
group: pyrexia in the ENGERIX-B Group between Day 5 and Day 14 (6.1%, vaccine-related: 0.3%). 
In both groups, body temperature was mostly >=38.0°C and <=39.0°C and lasted usually 3 days or 
less for both solicited and unsolicited pyrexia. Unsolicited vaccine-related systemic adverse event were 
mostly of mild intensity and lasted mainly 3 days or less in both groups. 
From Day 0 to Visit 2, 5 serious adverse events were reported by 4 subjects, all from the ENGERIX-B 
10 μg Group (1.2%): chest pain, infectious mononucleosis, parotitis associated with tracheobronchitis 
mycoplasmal and diabetes mellitus inadequate control. None of them were assessed by the 
investigator to be related to ENGERIX-B 10 μg and all resolved in 1 to 7 days. 
No subjects were withdrawn from the study due to an adverse event. 
Part II 
No deaths and vaccine-related serious adverse events were reported.

Assessor’s comments: 
Descriptive statistics were provided for all 4 subgroups and in addition for the HBVaxPRO 5 μg 
(modified process) Group and for the ENGERIX-B 10 μg Group (by pooling infants having been 
previously vaccinated with HEXAVAC or INFANRIX-HEXA). The safety analysis set comprised of 62 
subjects who received HBVaxPRO 5 μg (modified process) Group and 345 subjects who received 
ENGERIX-B 10 μg. 
Overall, the booster doses of HBVaxPRO 5 μg (modified process) and ENGERIX-B 10 μg appeared to be 
well tolerated. However, this conclusion is rather preliminary, because the sample sizes of the two 
HBVaxPRO groups were too small (34 and 28 subjects, respectively) to allow any meaningful safety 
analysis.

8.  Rapporteur’s Overall Conclusion And further action if 
required 
PAC No.: P46 052 
8.1.  Overall Conclusion/Outstanding Issue: 
The study was designed for descriptive analysis only and the protocol was noted (in short critical 
expert overview) to be agreed upon by the EMA in December 2006. 
One significant finding from this study report is the significantly lower pre-booster immune response 
induced by HEXAVAC compared with that induced by the INFANRIX-HEXA (47.9% vs 83.8% at > = 5 
mIU/ml;  39.6% vs 81.3% at > = 10 mIU/ml;  6.3% vs 42.9% at > = 100 mIU/ml). Furthermore, 
after post-booster dose, 14 out of 15 subjects in the  HEXAVAC groups did not achieve a protective 
titer of 10 mIU/ml. This finding suggests that children previously vaccinated with HEXAVAC may have 
increased risk of hepatitis B virus infection than children vaccinated with INFANRIX-HEXA. 
The other significant finding of this study report is the less than planned number of subjects received 
HBVAXPRO booster/challenge dose: only 62 subjects in total (34 in 1A and 28 in 2A groups) received 
HBVAXPRO/modified process, much less than originally planned (167 in 1A and 167 in 2A). This was 
explained by the MAH to be due to the shortage of HBVAXPRO/modified process (the lot of 
HBVaxPRO 5 μg (modified process) used at the time the study started (27 October 2008) 
expired on 14 March 2009 and at that time, due to equipment issues, the manufacture of a 
new lot was not possible in a reasonable timing). 
Nonetheless, all recruited subjects were vaccinated and most were evaluated for primary and 
secondary endpoint analyses. The drop-out rate among vaccinated subjects was very low. 
Importantly, pre-specified primary and secondary immunogenicity analyses consistently revealed that 
HBVaxPRO 5 μg (modified process) and ENGERIX-B 10 μg induced comparable anti-HBs anamnestic 
immune responses (endpoints: SPR of 10 mIU/ml, 100 mIU/ml, GMTs, GMTRs), either in HEXAVAC 
group or in INFANRIX-HEXA group, although children of two groups showed some degree of differences 
in pre-booster immunity. The post-booster responses showed relatively small variation in comparative 
groups (1A vs. 1B;  2A vs. 2B). The Assessor considers that these data from a total of 62 subjects in 
1A and 2A may still provide relevant insight into comparability (immunogenicity) of HBVAXPRO and 
Engerix-B – which is the primary objective of the study, despite the fact of its limited size of 62 
subjects. 
Safety and reactogenicity of the challenge or booster dose of HBVAXPRO and Engerix-B in this study 
was among the secondary objectives. The reduced sample size of 62 children in total (34 in 1A and 28 
in 2A groups) were too small to draw relevant conclusion. 
In conclusion, the submission of this final study report, the descriptive nature of this study, together 
with the pre-defined primary analysis of the study and some relevant information provided on 
comparability of immunogenicity between HBVAXPRO and Engerix-B, may allow the assessor to 
temporarily consider this FUM as fulfilled. However, the firm conclusion on comparability of  HBVAXPRO 
and Engerix-B is not well supported by the pre-booster data associated with primary vaccinations with 
HEXAVAC and INFANRIX-HEXA. In other words, HEXAVAC may be inferior to INFANRIX-HEXA in terms 
Assessment report under Article 46  
EMA/480078/2014

of anti-HBs antibody persistence (lower percentages of subjects at > = 5 mIU/ml, > = 10 mIU/ml, > = 
100 mIU/ml at pre-booster) and boostability (14 out of 15 subjects who did not achieve a anti-HBs 
titer of 10 mIU/ml were from the HEXAVAC group). In addition, reduction of the sample size in 
HBVAXPRO subgroups represented an obvious limitation of this study. This inconsistency of 
immunogenicity finding and limitation may need to be discussed in the context of the HBVAXPRO 
renewal process. 
  PAC is considered completely fulfilled, that is, no request for further studies using a larger sample 
size at the time of this assessment. – However, the inconsistent finding of immunogenicity (HBVAXPRO 
comparable to Engerix-B versus HEXAVAC inferior to INFANRIX-HEXA) and the obvious limitation of 
small sample size of HBVAXPRO groups in the present study may be discussed in the context of the 
HBVAXPRO renewal process.

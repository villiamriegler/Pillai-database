sufficient evidence that clopidogrel may induce 
exfoliative rashes either generalized or localized 
including hands and feet locations. This is supported 
particularly by sentinel and rechallenge cases.

A randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
clopidogrel film-coated tablets for the prevention of 
atherothrombotic and thromboembolic events, including 
stroke, in adult patients with atrial fibrillation who have 
at least one risk factor for vascular events and who 
cannot take vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy. 
Extension of Indication 
superiority study of clopidogrel (75 mg once daily) in 
combination with acetylsalicylic acid (75-100 mg once 
daily recommended) versus acetylsalicylic acid alone 
has been conducted in patients with atrial fibrillation 
patients and at least one risk factor for vascular 
events who cannot take VKA (EFC4912/ACTIVE-A 
study). In the (ACTIVE) trial program, patients with 
atrial fibrillation and one or more additional risk 
factors for stroke were enrolled in one of two trials. If 
they were considered suitable candidates for warfarin 
therapy, they were enrolled in ACTIVE-W, a 
comparison of warfarin with the combination of 
clopidogrel and aspirin. The results of ACTIVE-W 
showed that use of a vitamin-K antagonist reduced the 
risk for stroke by 42% over clopidogrel and aspirin. 
Those considered unsuitable for warfarin therapy were 
enrolled in ACTIVE-A and randomized to receive 
clopidogrel (75 mg/day) or placebo on a background 
of aspirin therapy. The safety profile of clopidogrel is 
well established and no new safety concerns were 
discovered during the analysis of ACTIVE A and W 
trials what must be analysed is the rates on known 
risks namely bleeding in the context of the benefits.

The SmPC text Section 4.6 has been updated to include the 
additional information on exposure during pregnancy 
based on the final report of the US Pregnancy 
Registry, listed as a category 3 study in the RMP 
(MEA 003.1 is fulfilled with this procedure). The 
Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. The RMP

avoid Gardasil 9 in case of pregnancy is maintained. The 
Package leaflet was updated accordingly to specify that if a 
woman is pregnant or becomes pregnant during the course 
of vaccination, it is recommended to postpone or interrupt 
vaccination until they are no longer pregnant.

Papillomatosis (JoRRP) based upon published 
observational studies. In addition, the MAH took the

campaigns on the reduction in the incidence of Juvenile-
onset Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis (JoRRP) based 
upon published observational studies was agreed for 
addition to SmPC section 5.1: 
“JoRRP is caused by upper airway infection primarily with 
HPV types 6 and 11, acquired vertically (mother-to-child) 
during childbirth. Observational studies in the US and 
Australia have shown that the introduction of Gardasil since 
2006 has led to declines in the incidence of JoRRP at 
population level.”

Study GDS07C compared immune responses to 9vHPV 
clinical data based on the final clinical study report 
for the paediatric study V503-020 (GDS07C), 
vaccine with immune responses to 4vHPV vaccine in 16-26 
years old boys and men. The responses to the 4 common

inferior in the 9vHPV group compared to the 4vHPV group. 
The responses to the 5 new HPV types were greater in the 
9vHPV group compared to the 4 vHPV group. The results 
were overall in agreement with the results previously 
shown in women 16-26 years of age. The safety results 
confirm the safety profile of the 9vHPV vaccine, and non 
new safety signal was detected.

children from 9 to 14 years of age. Results showed 
results of Protocol V503-010 and section 4.8 of the 
SmPC in order to add bronchospasm and urticaria. 
The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
For clarity, minor amendments have been included in 
Sections 4.4, and 4.6 and 5.1 of the SmPC. 
In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder 
(MAH) took the opportunity to update the list of local 
representatives in the Package Leaflet, to bring the 
PI in line with the latest QRD template version 10 
and to combine the SmPCs of the suspension for 
injection and the suspension for injection in a pre 
filled syringe. Furthermore, the MAH implemented 
minor linguistic revisions in the Portuguese, Czeck 
and Slovak texts. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
comparable immune responses in 2-dose recipients 
compared to the 3-dose recipients and support the 
proposed addition of a 2-dose schedule. For completeness 
and to align with the SmPC of Gardasil section 4.8 of the 
SmPC was updated to add bronchospasm and urticaria.

study for 16-23 year old women vaccinated with qHPV 
vaccine, a durable protection was statistically demonstrated 
to approximately 8 years.

726/2004, the European Commission requested on 
09 July 2015 the opinion of the European Medicines 
Agency on whether there is evidence of a causal 
association between HPV vaccination and CRPS 
and/or POTS, and if available information may 
require updates to the advice to healthcare 
professionals and patients, including changes to 
product information or other regulatory measures on 
the marketing authorisations concerned. 
As the request results from the evaluation of data 
resulting from pharmacovigilance activities, the 
CHMP opinion should be adopted on the basis of a

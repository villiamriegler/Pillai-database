Extension of indication to include additional non-malignant transplant indications (non-malignant 
diseases in the paediatric population) for Trecondi 1 g/5 g powder for solution for infusion based on 
final 12-months follow-up results of study MC-FludT.16/NM; a randomised phase II interventional 
study aimed to compare Treosulfan-based conditioning therapy with Busulfan-based conditioning prior 
to allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in paediatric patients with non-malignant 
diseases. 
Further, the MAH proposes to amend an existing warning on skin toxicity based on new literature data. 
Moreover, the MAH proposes to introduce a slightly modified dosing regimen according to the patient’s 
body surface based on long-term follow-up data of paediatric study MC-FludT.17/M, a Phase II trial to 
describe the safety and efficacy of Treosulfan based conditioning therapy prior to allogeneic 
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in paediatric patients with haematological malignancies, as 
well as a final analysis of the population pharmacokinetics of treosulfan in paediatric patients. As a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is 
updated in accordance. Version 1.0 of the RMP has also been submitted. 
The variation requested amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet 
and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Information relating to orphan designation 
Trecondi, was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/04/186 on 23 February 2004 in the 
following indication: Conditioning treatment prior to haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation. 
At the time of the granting of the Marketing Authoirisation, the Commission decided that on the basis of 
the COMP’s final opinion Trecondi no longer met the criteria for designation (established in Article 3 of 
Regulation No 141/2000) and that, therefore, it could not be designated as an orphan medicinal product. 
However, following the judgement of the General Court of 23-Sep-2020 the orphan designation was re-
established by the Commission Implementing Decision C(2020)8389 (final), dated 24-Nov-2020. 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant  to  Article  8  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006,  the  application  included  EMA  Decision 
P/0346/2020 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP was completed.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
The MAH is now requesting an extension of the indication to include additional non-malignant transplant 
indications (non-malignant diseases in the paediatric population based on final 12-months follow-up 
results of study MC-FludT.16/NM. 
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
Treosulfan in combination with fludarabine is indicated as part of conditioning treatment prior to 
allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) in adult patients with malignant and 
non-malignant diseases and in paediatric patients older than one month with malignant and 
non-malignant diseases. 
Epidemiology   
According to the Worldwide Network of Blood and Marrow Transplantation (WBMT), 82 718 HSCTs were 
conducted worldwide by 1 662 teams from 86 countries in 2016. Of those transplants, on average 53.5% 
are autologous and 46.5% are allogeneic; 45.2% occur in Europe, 24.4% in North America, 22.7% in 
the  South  East  Asia/Western  Pacific  Region,  5.1%  in  Latin-America  and  2.7%  in  the  African/East 
Mediterranean Region. Absolute numbers of alloHSCTs had increased from 20 333 in 2006 to 38 425 in 
2016.  
In 2019, there were 5 189 paediatric patients < 18 years of age receiving HSCT in Europe, 3 990 received 
an allogeneic and 1 199 an autologous HSCT [Passweg 2021]. 
Change in HSCT numbers is different for each indication with novel indications emerging. The number of 
alloHSCTs continues to increase annually, and reductions in organ damage, infection, and severe acute 
graft versus host disease (aGvHD) seem to be contributing to improved outcomes.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/117245/2023  
Page 11/183 
 
 
 
 
Biologic features, Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The use of the product reflects the current clinical practice of transplantation in the European Union. 
Clinical presentation 
In paediatric patients, alloHSCT has become a therapeutic option with curative potential for treatment 
of  otherwise 
incurable  hematological  malignancies  and  non-malignant  diseases,  e.g., 
immunodeficiencies,  haemoglobinopathies  (Hb-pathies),  bone  marrow  failure  (BMF)  syndromes,  or 
metabolic diseases. 
In non-malignant diseases such as primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) alloHSCT has become increasingly 
successful. 
Management 
Patients undergoing an alloHSCT are prepared with chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy combined with 
radiotherapy, the so-called conditioning or preparative regimen, with three aims: to reduce the tumour 
burden  when  the  disease  is  neoplastic,  to  eliminate  the  self-renewing  capacity  of  the  patient’s  own 
haematopoiesis, and to suppress the recipient’s immune system in order to allow engraftment of donor 
stem  cells.  Exceptions  to  this  rule  are  infants  with  severe  combined  immune  deficiency  (SCID)  and 
patients with severe aplastic anaemia (SAA) with an identical twin donor who may be grafted without 
conditioning.  
The  purine  analogue  fludarabine  (FLU)  has  been  widely  incorporated  into  such  regimens.  It  is  highly 
immunosuppressive,  producing  profound  lymphopenia,  which  has  been  shown  to  facilitate  allogeneic 
stem cell engraftment. It has the additional advantages of having anti-tumour activity in haematologic 
malignancies and a low non-haematologic toxicity profile 
Efficacy, safety and PK of treosulfan-based conditioning regimens in paediatric subjects prior to alloHSCT 
have already been demonstrated in several published studies. It has been shown that treosulfan is highly 
effective enabling sustained engraftment without increasing the risk for severe acute or chronic graft-
versus-host disease (aGvHD / cGvHD). Considering that most children and adolescents with malignancies 
or non-malignant diseases have either been heavily pre-treated or have already undergone a previous 
HSCT,  the  toxicity  profile  is  obviously  low  compared  with  either  TBI  containing  regimens  or  other 
myeloablative  treatments  (e.g.,  busulfan,  cyclophosphamide,  etoposide  or  melphalan).  However, 
children > 4 years of age undergoing alloHSCT for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia should preferentially 
be conditioned with TBI-based regimens. Results of the medac-sponsored phase 2 trial MC-FludT.17/M 
in 70 children with malignant transplantation indications support this observation. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Treosulfan,  a  prodrug  of  a  bifunctional  alkylating  agent  and  a  broad  antineoplastic  and  potent  anti-
leukemic medicine fulfils the criteria for a perfect cytotoxic agent for conditioning regimens: sufficient 
stem cell toxicity (with respect to primitive as well as committed stem cells) and immunosuppression, to 
enable rapid and stable engraftment, low organ toxicity, especially with respect to the liver, kidneys, 
lung,  and  the  nervous  system,  sufficient  cytotoxicity  to  guarantee  an  effective  treatment  of  the 
underlying  hematological  malignancy,  and  predictive  pharmacokinetics  (IV  administration,  linear 
pharmacokinetics,  low inter-individual variability, no enzyme-dependent drug activation). 
Assessment report

Page 12/183 
 
 
 
 
Under  physiological  conditions  (pH  7.4,  temperature  37°C)  the  pharmacologically  inactive  treosulfan 
converts spontaneously (non-enzymatically) into a reactive monoepoxide intermediate and finally to L-
diepoxybutan.  These  epoxides  are  able  to  react  with  neutrophilic  centres  of  biological  molecules  like 
proteins  or  DNA  and  are  considered  to  be  responsible  for  the  antineoplastic  activity  via  secondary 
biological mechanisms. 
Due to its pronounced toxicity against committed and primitive hematopoietic stem cells as well as its 
proven  immunosuppressive  and  haematotoxic  characteristics,  treosulfan  is  currently  developed  as  an 
alternative conditioning agent to busulfan or TBI. 
Based  on  the  given  clinical  experience  in  adults,  treosulfan  has  been  widely  used  as  therapeutic 
alternative in paediatric HSCT conditioning regimens in the past years.  
Patients, who undergo HSCT for non-malignant diseases, especially immunodeficiencies and metabolic 
diseases, are mostly infants, toddlers, and small children. The patterns of acute and especially late 
effects are different compared to adult transplantation patients and demand special attention. Mental 
development, growth and hormonal disorders, fertility, and risk of secondary cancer (particularly after 
TBI) are of special interest and are followed-up by national and international registries (e.g., within 
EBMT). Since the first successful allogeneic HSCT, more than 50,000 paediatric patients have 
undergone this procedure in Europe, and more than 2500 children are transplanted annually in Europe. 
The MAH is now requesting an extension of the indication to include additional non-malignant transplant 
indications  (non-malignant  diseases  in  the  paediatric  population  based  on  final  12-months  follow-up 
results of study MC-FludT.16/NM. 
Further, the MAH proposes to amend an existing warning on skin toxicity based on new literature data 
and to introduce a slightly modified dosing regimen according to the patient’s body surface based on 
long-term follow-up data of paediatric study MC-FludT.17/M in paediatric patients with haematological 
malignancies, as well as a final analysis of the population pharmacokinetics of treosulfan in paediatric 
patients.  
2.1.3.  The development programme/ compliance with CHMP guidance/ 
scientific advice 
Treosulfan  in  combination  with  fludarabine  is  indicated  as  part  of  conditioning  treatment  prior  to 
allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) in adult patients with malignant and non-
malignant diseases, and in paediatric patients older than one month with malignant diseases. 
The following relevant guidelines were followed:

•  Appendix  1  to  the  Guideline  on  the  Evaluation  of  Anticancer  Medicinal  Products  in  Man 
(CHMP/EWP/267575/06) 
•  Addendum on Paediatric Oncology (CPMP/EWP/569/02)

Treosulfan based conditioning in adult patients: 
Three medac sponsored Phase 1 / 2 trials investigated the conditioning regimen treosulfan / fludarabine 
in  adult  subjects.  Efficacy  and  safety  parameters  of  treosulfan-based  conditioning  were  analysed  in

subjects  with  advanced  haematological  malignancies  prior  to  alloHSCT.  Furthermore,  a  prospective, 
comparative pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial (medac protocol code MC-FludT.14/L) in adult acute myeloid 
leukaemia  and  myeloid  dysplastic  syndrome  (MDS)  subjects,  who  were  non-eligible  for  standard 
busulfan-  or  TBI-based  myeloablative  conditioning,  started  in  Nov-2008.  After  dose-  and  regimen-
adjustment  for  treosulfan  to  10  g/m²  on  day  -4,  -3,  -2,  the  trial  restarted  in  June  2013  and  was 
completed in Jan-2018. The trial demonstrated statistically significant non-inferiority regarding event-
free survival (EFS) as well as improved overall survival (OS) and non-relapse mortality (NRM) in favour 
of treosulfan. 
Treosulfan based conditioning in paediatric patients: 
As a requirement within the paediatric investigational plan (PIP; PIP number EMEA-000883- PIP01-10, 
decision number P/122/2011) for treosulfan and subsequent modifications, the paediatric committee of 
EMA  (PDCO)  requested  medac  to  conduct  a  retrospective  evaluation  (meta-analysis)  on  safety  and 
efficacy data of treosulfan-based conditioning in paediatric subjects registered within the EBMT database. 
Within  this  registry  study,  data  of  521  allogeneic  and  83  autologous  paediatric  subjects  transplanted 
between Jan-2005 and Jul-2010 were evaluated. 
The median treosulfan dose administered for alloHSCT was in total 42 g/m2 within 3 consecutive days. 
Treatment was effective and well tolerated in children of all age groups with malignant as well as non-
malignant  diseases.  The  dose  of  treosulfan  was  without  significant  impact  on  all  analysed  safety  and 
efficacy parameters. In addition, medac was requested within the PIP to conduct 2 transplantation trials 
in paediatric subjects, one in subjects with malignant diseases (MC-FludT.17/M) and another trial in 
subjects with non-malignant diseases (MC-FludT.16/NM). 
The  MC-FludT.17/M  trial  started  on  21-Nov-2014  and  was  completed  on  30-Sep-2019  (last  subject 
completed longer term follow-up). 
In  non-malignant  disorders  with  a  high  risk  of  graft  rejection,  intensified  regimens  with  additional 
thiotepa combined with either treosulfan / fludarabine or busulfan / fludarabine are recommended by 
EBMT / ESID guidelines to ensure engraftment.  
In  order  to  evaluate  the  current  clinical  practice  of  the  use  of  thiotepa  in  combination  with  either 
treosulfan  /  fludarabine-based  or  busulfan  /  fludarabine-based  conditioning  regimens,  another 
retrospective analysis of the EBMT database in children with non-malignant diseases, who underwent 
allogeneic  HSCT  between  the  years  2010  and  2014  was  performed.  A  large  variety  of  non-malignant 
diseases comprising data from 2187 patients were included in the EBMT registry analysis. In total, 895 
out of the 2187 patients received a preparative regimen consisting of treosulfan / fludarabine either in 
combination  with  thiotepa  (473  patients)  or  without  thiotepa  (422  patients).  Thiotepa  was  most 
frequently added in Hb-pathies (374 out of 590 patients), affecting about half of the patients treated 
with treosulfan / fludarabine or busulfan / fludarabine. The number of patients who received thiotepa in 
addition to treosulfan / fludarabine increased significantly from 44% (66 out of 149 patients) in the year 
2010  to  65%  of  patients  (140  out  of  217  patients)  in  the  year  2014.  Several  retrospective  studies 
covering  the  years  2009  to  2015  also  indicate  the  more  frequent  use  of  thiotepa  in  treosulfan  / 
fludarabine-based conditioning regimens in paediatric patients with nonmalignant diseases. Depending 
on the underlying disease, thiotepa was administered in up to 74% of patients. 
The more frequent use of thiotepa reflects the current clinical practice of most transplantation centres 
in the European Union. The trial, MC-FludT.16/NM, was designed based on the modified PIP number 
EMEA-000883-PIP01-10-M01, decision number P/0104/2013. As the initial trial design did not reflect the 
more frequent use of thiotepa, but required the vast majority of subjects (at least 85 out of 100 subjects) 
to be treated without additional thiotepa, a PIP modification was submitted to the PDCO of EMA in Nov-
2016 in order to permit the additional use of thiotepa in all qualified subjects at the discretion of the

Investigator. The PIP modification number EMEA-000883-PIP01-10-M03 was approved by the PDCO of 
EMA  on  17-Mar-2017  (Decision  number  P/0059/2017).  Details  of  trial  design  and  conduct  were 
predefined by the PDCO. The most recent CTP version complies with the most recent PIP modification 
(EMEA-000883-PIP01-10-M05; Decision number P/0346/2020). 
MC-FludT.16/NM: Clinical phase II trial to compare safety and efficacy of treosulfan-based conditioning 
therapy with busulfan-based conditioning therapy in children of different age groups with non-malignant 
diseases  requiring  myeloablative  conditioning  treatment  prior  to  alloHSCT.  To  describe  the  TREO 
compared to the conventional dose BU (control), each product was administered as part of a standardised 
FLU-containing conditioning regimen and also contributed to a pharmacokinetic model. 
Analysis  of  treosulfan  and  monoepoxide  plasma  levels  in  a  subgroup  of  subjects  allocated to the  test 
arm of the trial contributes to a separately reported population PK evaluation for treosulfan. 
The clinical trial report (CTR) focusses mainly on the complete and final 12-month data, but also contains 
longer-term follow-up data that were available by data cut-off on 07-Jun-2021.  
MC-FludT.17/M: Clinical phase II trial to describe the safety and efficacy of TREO-based conditioning 
therapy prior to alloHSCT in paediatric patients with haematological malignancies; To describe the safety 
and  efficacy  of  TREO  as  part  of  a  standardised  FLU-containing  conditioning  and  to  contribute  to  a 
pharmacokinetic model.  
The  final  analysis  of  MC-FludT.14/L  Trial  II  has  confirmed  the  non-inferiority  of  TREO-based 
conditioning compared to reduced-intensity conditioning therapy based on intravenous BU. Additionally, 
superiority of TREO versus BU could now be shown with the final data set.  
Longer-term follow-up data will be collected until the last recruited subject has completed visit Month 
36 and presented in an updated version of the CTR expected in 2023. Joint PK and Pop-PK evaluations 
of treosulfan and monoepoxide drug concentration measurements of both trials MCFludT. 16/NM and 
MC-FludT.17/M were reported by Venn Life Sciences. 
Furthermore, both paediatric studies have been completed. Final CSRs are now available, with 3-year 
follow-up survival data for study MC-FludT.17/M and 1-year follow-up data for study 16/NM.  
Moreover, the PopPK model for TREO was updated and the BSA-adapted dose regimen of TREO in 
paediatric patients slightly modified. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GLP, GCP 
 GLP 
Most of the early study results on treosulfan are available as brief summaries of LEO contracted studies 
conducted in the 1970s and 1980s to support the use of treosulfan in clinical trials and application for 
marketing  authorisation  as  an  anti-cancer  agent.  The  corresponding  data  as  well  as  other  supportive 
information is also published in the literature. Accordingly, the historical information of the nonclinical 
dossier regarding study design and reporting of results does not comply with current regulatory quality 
standards like Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and guidelines for e.g. the conduct of safety studies (OECD 
and  ICH  guidelines).  However,  the  studies  were  generally  carried  out  state  of  the  art  at  the  time  of 
performance and were accepted by the European authorities. Other, more recently conducted nonclinical 
studies (e.g. a 4-week subchronic toxicity and toxicokinetic study in adult rats as well as a toxicity study 
in juvenile rats) are in full compliance with GLP regulations.

All 7 clinical studies submitted by medac have been designed, conducted, and analysed according to 
the principles of Good Clinical Practice.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The investigational drug substance, treosulfan, was already registered in the 70ies and 80ies of the last 
century  by  LEO  Pharmaceutical  Products  in  Denmark  (LEO)  for  the  chemotherapeutic  treatment  of 
patients  with  ovarian  cancer  in  several  European  countries.  Pharmacological  and  toxicological 
characteristics of treosulfan were initially assessed by the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) under the 
compound identifier NSC-39069.  
In 1990 medac GmbH took over the product with all legal rights and obligations. Later on, chemistry, 
manufacturing  and  control  data,  as  well  as  new  nonclinical  and  clinical  data  have  been  generated  by 
medac to support the clinical development of a treosulfan-based conditioning therapy prior to autologous 
or allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).  
The  early  nonclinical  development  of  treosulfan  as  an  anti-cancer  agent  started  in  the  1960s  in  the 
research laboratories of LEO. By order of LEO, treosulfan (NSC-39069) was extensively tested in vitro 
and  in  vivo  by  the  Cancer  Chemotherapy  National  Service  Center  in  collaboration  with  the  NCI.  The 
corresponding  study  reports  were  compiled  by  LEO  within  a  nonclinical  dossier  for  application  of 
marketing authorisation of treosulfan for treatment of ovarian cancer in several European countries (LEO, 
1978b).  The  nonclinical  study  results  of  NSC-39069  and  various  other  structures  were  published  as 
special issue of Cancer Chemotherapy Reports (Schmidt et al., 1965). 
Later  on,  an  extensive  nonclinical  programme  was  performed  to  evaluate  the  pharmacodynamics, 
pharmacokinetics and the toxicological properties of treosulfan. In some studies, other alkylating agents, 
including busulfan, or reactive metabolites of treosulfan were applied for comparison and elucidation of 
mechanistic aspects. 
Most of the early study results on treosulfan are available as brief summaries of LEO contracted studies 
conducted in the 1970s and 1980s to support the use of treosulfan in clinical trials and application for 
marketing  authorisation  as  an  anti-cancer  agent.  The  corresponding  data  as  well  as  other  supportive 
information is also published in the literature.  
Accordingly, the historical information of the nonclinical dossier regarding study design and reporting of 
results does not comply with current regulatory quality standards like Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) 
and guidelines for e.g. the conduct of safety studies (OECD and ICH guidelines). However, the studies 
were generally carried out state of the art at the time of performance and were accepted by the European 
authorities.  
Other, more recently conducted nonclinical studies (e.g. a 4-week subchronic toxicity and toxicokinetic 
study in adult rats as well as a toxicity study in juvenile rats) are in full compliance with GLP regulations. 
The most recent 4-week toxicity study in rats also used the new lyophilised drug product formulation 
and  covers,  therefore,  the  only  three  days  treatment  period  recommended  for  clinical  use  in  the 
indication  of  conditioning  prior  to  HSCT.  In  view  of  the  alkylating  properties  and  the  toxicological 
characteristics of treosulfan as well as the clinical use for life-threatening conditions indicated for HSCT,

further  specific  toxicological  qualification  procedures,  in  particular  regarding  potential  genotoxic 
properties of impurities, metabolites and decomposition products, are deemed not necessary. Moreover, 
its established clinical use in Europe for decades and the corresponding pharmacovigilance information 
is in line with the overall conclusions from the nonclinical safety studies drawn by the MAH. 
In  June  2019,  the  European  Commission  approved  treosulfan  for  marketing  authorisation  with  the 
following label: “Treosulfan in combination with fludarabine is indicated as part of conditioning treatment 
prior to allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) in adult patients with malignant 
and non-malignant diseases, and in paediatric patients older than one month with malignant diseases” 
(see SmPC TRECONDI®).  
Meanwhile, medac also established a new production processes and a lyophilized formulation of the drug 
product. 
Treosulfan  is  a  prodrug.  The  parent  compound  is  water  soluble  and  converts  under  physiological 
conditions by non-enzymatic intra-molecular substitution into a reactive monoepoxide intermediate (S,S-
EBDM) and subsequently to diepoxybutane (S,S-DEB) (Figure 2.4-4). The reactive intermediates alkylate 
DNA and create interstrand cross-links. Alkylation also affects other biological molecules and structures, 
involved  in  various  physiological  functions  and  thus  contributes  to  the  stem  cell  toxicity  as  well  as 
generally broad cytotoxicity of treosulfan. 
Treosulfan 
Figure 2.4-1: Conversion of treosulfan to biologically active epoxides (Glowka et al., 2012) 
The two hydroxyl groups in position 2 and 3 of the treosulfan molecule are responsible for significant 
differences  between  treosulfan  and  busulfan  (1,4-butanediol-dimethylsulfonate),  which  is  currently 
approved  for  conditioning  treatment  prior  to  HSCT.  These  differences  include  physico-chemical, 
pharmacological, pharmacokinetic and toxicological characteristics.

The  directly  alkylating  agent  busulfan  was  used  as  positive  control  treatment  in  a  number  of 
pharmacological and toxicological tests and demonstrated a higher potential to induce hepatotoxicity, 
lung toxicity, CNS toxicity and effects on fertility than treosulfan.  
Due to its long-established clinical use for treatment of European patients with ovarian cancer and the 
well-known clinical as well as nonclinical safety profile, pharmacokinetics and efficacy, treosulfan was 
more recently evaluated in high-dose treatment regimens with subsequent autologous HSCT. The proven 
haematopoietic stem cell toxicity against both, primitive and committed haematopoietic stem cells, as 
well  as  its  immunosuppressive  and  haematotoxic  characteristics,  qualify  treosulfan  in  particular  as  a 
developmental candidate for conditioning treatment of adult and paediatric patients with malignant as 
well as non-malignant diseases indicated for allogeneic HSCT. 
For conditioning treatment, preferentially the combination of treosulfan with fludarabine (for pre-
transplant immunosuppression) is applied. The drug product is used for intravenous infusion after 
dissolution in 20 mL (1.0 g strength) or 100 mL (5.0 g strength) 0.45% sterile saline. A single daily 
dose of 10 g/m² to 14 g/m2 body surface area of treosulfan is to be administered on 3 consecutive 
days. 
The MAH is now requesting an extension of the indication to include additional non-malignant transplant 
indications (non-malignant diseases in the paediatric population based on final 12-months follow-up 
results of study MC-FludT.16/NM. 
Further, the MAH proposes to amend an existing warning on skin toxicity based on new literature data 
and to introduce a slightly modified dosing regimen according to the patient’s body surface based on 
long-term follow-up data of paediatric study MC-FludT.17/M in paediatric patients with haematological 
malignancies, as well as a final analysis of the population pharmacokinetics of treosulfan in paediatric 
patients.  
2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
Introduction 
An overview of relevant studies to evaluate the pharmacodynamic profile of treosulfan is shown:

Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
Primary  pharmacodynamic  properties  of  treosulfan  comprehend  cytotoxicity,  the  main  mechanism  of 
action,  myeloablative  and  immunosuppressive  effects,  and  anti-tumour  effects  with  focus  on 
haematological malignancies considered relevant for the proposed use as conditioning treatment prior 
to HSCT. 
In treosulfan-treated cells of the human chronic myelogenous leukemic cell line K562, DNA cross-links 
formed slowly, while incubation with preformed epoxides showed faster and more efficient cross-linking. 
Alkylation in plasmid DNA occurred at guanine bases with sequence selectivity similar to other alkylating 
agents such as the nitrogen mustards (Hartley et al., 1999).  
DEB  formed  DNA-protein  cross-links  between  cysteine  thiols  within  proteins  and  the  N-7  guanine 
positions  within  DNA  (Michaelson-Richie  et  al.,  2010).  DEB-mediated  DNA-protein  cross-linking  was 
investigated in human fibrosarcoma (HT1080) cells. Over 150 proteins including histones, high mobility 
group proteins, transcription factors, splicing factors, and tubulins were found among those covalently 
cross-linked to chromosomal DNA in the presence of DEB. A large portion of the cross-linked proteins 
are known factors involved in DNA binding, transcriptional regulation, cell signalling, DNA repair, and 
DNA damage response (Gherezghiher et al., 2013).

While  alkylating  agents  (melphalan,  treosulfan)  and  doxorubicin  demonstrated  marked  cytotoxicity, 
nucleotide  analogs  (gemcitabine,  cytarabine)  induced  only  limited  apoptosis  in  human  bone  marrow 
stromal cells (Schmidmaier et al., 2006). 
Cytotoxicity  of  treosulfan  and  busulfan  was  evaluated  in  vitro  in  two  human  leukaemia  cell  lines  and 
revealed a consistently higher cytotoxic potential than busulfan (Lanvers-Kaminsky et al., 2006). ALL 
samples of paediatric origin were tested for ex vivo chemosensitivity to various cytotoxic drugs. Their 
combined drug resistance profile was analysed. Lymphoblasts from patients who experienced multiple 
relapses  were  comparably  resistant  to  daunorubicin,  doxorubicin,  cyclophosphamide,  ifosfamide, 
busulfan, treosulfan, fludarabine, clofarabine, and bortezomib (Pogorzala et al., 2015). 
Compared  with  other  dimethanesulfonate  compounds  (related  to  busulfan),  treosulfan  exhibited 
comparably  high  in  vitro  activity,  but  relatively  low  activity  in  vivo  (in  case  of  only  one  single  dose 
treatment)  in  terms  of  their  toxicity  to  different  haematopoietic  stem  cell  subsets  (Westerhof  et  al., 
2000). Treosulfan was more active against 20 leukemic cell specimens of paediatric origin and against 3 
leukaemia-derived cell lines than busulfan. Beyond that, purified haematopoietic CD34+ stem cells were 
most  sensitive  against  treosulfan,  followed  by  CD56+CD3-  NK  and  CD3+T  cells.  In  the  lymphocyte 
subsets, treosulfan was threefold and in stem cells 20fold more effective than busulfan (Munkelt et al., 
2008).  
Using  dose  fractionation  and  repeated  administrations  of  treosulfan,  profound  stem  cell  depleting 
properties in all stem cell subsets were shown in vitro and in vivo. This is in contrast to busulfan, which 
is  predominantly  toxic  for  long-term  repopulating  stem  cells  which  might  explain  its  low 
immunosuppressive potential (Ploemacher [report], 2000; Ploemacher [report], 2003).  
Conditioning  with  non-myeloablative  doses  of  treosulfan,  followed  by  transplantation  with  syngeneic 
bone marrow (BM) donor cells, permitted long-term mixed-donor chimerism in a murine model of sickle 
cell disease. The induced level of chimerism correlated with improvement in sickle cell disease (SCD) 
related haematologic parameters, normalisation of urine osmolality, and improvement in liver and spleen 
pathology (Devadasan et al., 2018). 
Myeloablative and immunosuppressive properties of treosulfan were investigated in mice treated with 
treosulfan,  cyclophosphamide,  or  busulfan  at  sublethal  doses  that  maintained  survival  without  bone 
marrow  support.  Treosulfan  and  busulfan  induced  a  high  and  persisting  degree  of  myeloablation,  as 
compared  with  cyclophosphamide.  Moreover,  treosulfan  was  more  effective  than  busulfan  or 
cyclophosphamide  in  depletion  of  splenic  B  and  T  cells.  Treatment  with  treosulfan  induced  only 
interleukin-2  production  in  spleen  cells  of  mice  for  a  short  time  only  and  had no  significant  effect  on 
synthesis of tumour necrosis factor-alpha and/or interferon-gamma as compared with either busulfan or 
cyclophosphamide (Sjöö et al., 2006). 
The immunosuppressive activity of treosulfan was investigated using human peripheral blood B and T 
lymphocytes  and  mice  immunized  with  keyhole  limpet  haemocyanin.  Low  dose  treosulfan  induced 
suppression  of  the  early  immune  response,  probably  including  the  proliferation/differentiation  of  cells 
repopulating lymphoid organs and influenced the balance of regulatory T cell subpopulations (Melchers 
et al., 2000). 
Fractionated high-dose treosulfan or busulfan treatment was investigated in mice to prepare recipients 
for  allogeneic  bone  marrow  transplantation.  In  addition,  treosulfan  and  busulfan  treatment  regimens 
including concomitant treatment with anti-T cell antibodies and/or cyclophosphamide were assessed for 
induction of donor-type chimerism and tolerance to subsequent donor skin grafts after H-2 incompatible 
allogeneic HSCT (van Pel et al., 2003, 2004). Concomitant treatment of the stem cell depleting agent 
(busulfan or treosulfan) with T cell depletion with anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 monoclonal antibodies appeared 
to be important for achieving immune tolerance and induction of high levels of donor-type chimerism. 
Assessment report

Cyclophosphamide  was,  however,  effective  in  enhancing  low  levels  of  donor  chimerism  produced  by 
treosulfan-based conditioning regimen (BioTransplant, 2000). 
Permanent acceptance of donor-type skin grafts and rejection of “third party” skin grafts after low dose 
treosulfan-based conditioning and allogeneic HSCT was demonstrated in mice and confirmed functional 
aspects of the established donor-related immune system (Andersson et al.,2003). 
Anti-haematological  malignancies  effects  of  Treosulfan  were  tested  in  vitro  by  differential  staining 
cytotoxicity assays against 55 tissue specimens from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), 
adult  T-cell  leukaemia/lymphoma  (ATLL),  acute  myeloid  leukaemia  (AML),  myelodysplastic  syndrome 
(MDS), and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). Treosulfan induced dose-dependent cell death resulting in 
LC90 values of 2 to 512 μg/mL (Bath Analytical, 1994). Treosulfan was also more active than busulfan 
against  leukaemic  cells  isolated  from  20  paediatric  ALL  patients  as  well  as  against  three  leukaemia-
derived cell lines with increasing IC50 values from initial diagnosis (chemotherapy naive specimens) to 
relapse (pretreated specimens; Munkelt et al., 2008). Treosulfan treatment of the myeloma cell lines 
NCI-H929 and U266 led to apoptosis in both cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Meinhardt 
et al., 2003). 
Chemosensitivity tests were performed in AML cell lines and primary cells isolated from patients. All cell 
types displayed dose-dependent sensitivity to treosulfan (Schmidmaier et al.,2004). In peripheral blood 
mononuclear  cells  (PBMCs)  from  patients  with  chronic  lymphocytic  leukaemia  (CLL)  treosulfan,  4-
hydroperoxy-cyclophosphamide, fludarabine or cytarabine, but not busulfan, were effective inducers of 
apoptosis. Cell death was induced via caspase-activation (Ristovska et al., 2009).  
The  in  vivo  antileukaemic  activity  of  treosulfan  was  compared  with  the  activity  of  equitoxic  doses  of 
cyclophosphamide or busulfan using human ALL cells established in a xenotransplant mouse model in 
immunocompromised animals. Treosulfan was more effective with regard to the numbers of complete 
ALL regressions and the number of cured animals (Fichtner et al., 2003). In Fisher rats with Dunning 
leukaemia the chemotherapeutic activity of treosulfan was very much greater than that of busulfan, and 
was fully equivalent to the effect of 6-mercaptopurine (Jones et al., 1960; Schmidt et al., 1965). 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Secondary  pharmacology  studies  included  effects  of  treosulfan  on  erythrocytes,  on  the  migration  of 
immunocompetent blood cells, and against solid tumour types. 
Exposure of human erythrocytes to treosulfan in vitro significantly stimulated suicidal erythrocyte death 
(eryptosis),  at  least  in  part  by  inducing  oxidative  stress  and  stimulating  Ca2+  entry.  This  effect 
presumably contributes to the anaemia observed after treosulfan treatment in the animal studies (Peter 
et al., 2015). 
Treatment  of  PBMCs  of  healthy  donors  with  treosulfan  significantly  inhibited  the  migration  of 
immunocompetent mononuclear cells across a fibronectin layer. The effect was observed in T cells (CD4+ 
and CD8+ cells) as well as in CD14+ monocytes to a similar extent (Kopadze et al., 2007). 
Apart from activity against haematological malignancies, treosulfan also exhibits a broad anti-tumour 
activity against numerous solid tumour types as demonstrated against human tumour xenografts in rats 
and mice, human tumour biopsies, and tumour cell lines. 
Treosulfan was consistently more cytotoxic (at lower IC90 values) than busulfan when evaluated in vitro 
on  four  human  Ewing  tumour,  four  human  neuroblastoma,  and  two  human  osteosarcoma  cell  lines 
(Lanvers-Kaminsky et al., 2006).

Safety pharmacology programme 
The  effect  of  treosulfan  on  vital  organ  functions  (cardiovascular  system,  respiratory  system,  central 
nervous  system)  as  well  as  on  supplemental  organ  functions  (gastro-intestinal  tract,  blood)  was 
investigated in vitro and in vivo. The historical studies (White, 1962; LEO, 1978b) provided no evidence 
of adverse effects regarding (maximum doses tested are given in brackets): 
- Cardiovascular system: blood pressure in rats (40 mg/kg i.v.), blood pressure and ECG in dogs (200 
mg/kg i.v.); 
- Central nervous system: general behaviour of mice (300 mg/kg i.p.), dogs (222 mg/kg i.v and monkey 
(222 mg/kg i.v.) anticonvulsive and analgesic effects in mice (100 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg i.p.); 
- Respiratory system: isolated tracheal muscle preparations of the cat (2 x 10-5 g/mL); 
- Gastro-intestinal tract: gastric secretion in rats (50 mg/kg p.o.), isolated small intestine preparations 
of the guinea pig (10-5 g/mL). 
- Local anaesthetic effects: mice (tail, injection of 0.05 mL of a 2% treosulfan solution). 
A recently conducted in vitro hERG K+ channel assay exhibited no potential for an arrhythmogenic effect 
at  a  treosulfan  concentration  of  1000  μM  (B'SYS,  2017),  which  corresponds  approximately  to  the 
clinically relevant Cmax of 300 μg/ml in adult patient treated with 10 g/m2 BSA (Hilger et al., 1998). Up 
to a five-time higher treosulfan concentration (5000 μM) was assessed on an array of key cardiac ion 
channels proposed by  CiPA,  in  particular  hERG,  hNav1.5  (both  peak  and  late),  hCav1.2,  hKir2.1,  and 
hKCNQ1/minK ion channels. In these assays, the % inhibitions at the highest concentration tested were 
< 50%.  
In cardiomyocytes, only the treosulfan top concentration of 5000 μM caused a transient increase in the 
beat  period  as  well  as  a  nominal  shortening  of  the  field  potential  duration  (FPD),  while  the  sodium 
channel endpoints were not affected at any of the concentrations tested in this assay. The change in the 
beat period at 5000 μM treosulfan may result from the instability of the test compound and the given 
closed cell culture system (CYP1269 R10, 2020). 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The combination of treosulfan with fludarabine resulted in a synergistic cytotoxic effect against human 
leukaemic cells isolated from 20 paediatric patients (Munkelt et al., 2008). Conditioning treatment with 
treosulfan/fludarabine or busulfan/fludarabine resulted in decreased severity of acute graft versus host 
disease  (aGvHD)  compared  to  total  body  irradiation  (TBI).  Moreover,  treosulfan/fludarabine  was 
associated  with  improved  immune  reconstitution  despite  early  gastro-intestinal  or  cutaneous  toxicity 
(Bouazzaoui et al., 2014). 
AML-  or  MDS-derived  myeloid  cell  lines  as  well  as  primary  marrow  cells  from  patients  with  MDS  and 
healthy donors were exposed to treosulfan, radiation or both, and the extent of apoptosis was assessed. 
In  vitro  pre-exposure  to  treosulfan  did  not  clearly  enhance  radiation  induced  cell  death  (Zang  et  al., 
2015). 
The  combination  of  treosulfan  with  TBI  prior  to  bone  marrow  transplantation  in  rats  showed  that 
treosulfan possesses certain characteristics of a radio-sensitiser in vivo (Sender et al., 2009). Results of 
low-dose treosulfan added to an immune-suppressive regimen consisting of T cell depleting antibodies, 
fludarabine,  and  thymic  irradiation  indicate  that  low-dose  treosulfan  may  be  considered  as  a  useful 
component  of  a  truly  nonmyeloablative  conditioning  protocol  in  providing  for  sustained  mixed

haematopoietic  chimerism  of  donor  type  and,  consequently,  in  establishing  a  platform  for  adoptive 
immunotherapy as well as donor-derived organ transplantation (Ploemacher et al., 2004b). 
Permanent  mixed  chimerism  and  donor-specific  tolerance  was  achieved  in  mice  conditioned,  prior  to 
donor mouse muscle precursor cell transplantation, with a treosulfan treatment combined with a single 
cyclophosphamide dose, and finally a donor bone marrow transplantation (Stephan et al., 2006). 
Profound stem cell toxic, myeloablative and immunosuppressive effects were demonstrated in various in 
vitro and in vivo models employing treosulfan alone or in combination with other clinically established 
conditioning  components.  The  strong  anti-leukemic  activity  of  treosulfan  potentially  reduces  post-
transplant relapse of underlying malignancies in a clinical setting of allogeneic HSCT. 
2.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
 An  overview  of  relevant  studies  conducted  to  evaluate  the  absorption,  distribution,  metabolism,  and 
excretion (ADME) of treosulfan is shown: 
Assessment report

Various bioanalytical procedures were validated and applied to detect concentrations of treosulfan and 
related epoxides in plasma, urine and tissues of different species. 
Treosulfan and its alkylating metabolites were rapidly transformed, partly metabolised and excreted if 
not bound to biological macromolecules. Treosulfan as well as the epoxides distribute well into the bone 
marrow, reaching 70-80% of plasma concentration. Accordingly, it is observed a preferred exposure of 
the target tissue facilitating the intended action of conditioning treatment, namely myeloablation as well 
as immunosuppression of recipients of HSCT. There is no indication for accumulation in blood or tissues 
after repeated exposure.  
In contrast to busulfan, treosulfan has a very low potential to cross the blood-brain-barrier which is in 
line with the clinical experience that anti-convulsive co-medication is not necessary for treosulfan based 
conditioning treatment.  
In  opposition  to  gender,  age  does  influence  the  pharmacokinetic  parameters  of  treosulfan  and  its 
monoepoxide  transformation  product  as  demonstrated  in  experiments  in  juvenile  rats.  Half-life  of 
treosulfan in plasma of juvenile rats was somewhat longer than in young adults and accordingly, a higher 
exposure  can  be  expected  in  juvenile  animals.  This  observation  does  also  fit  to  clinical  PK  data  in 
paediatric  patients  and  is  reflected  in  a  population  pharmacokinetic  modelling.  The  low  SS-EBDM 
exposure of liver, lungs and brain, may contribute to comparably low toxicity of treosulfan with regard 
to vital organ functions of experimental animals.

As treosulfan does not undergo either relevant spontaneous or GST-medicated conjugation with GSH, 
the interactions with other GSH-conjugated drugs or competition are not expected. However, metabolic 
phenotyping identified treosulfan as a weak substrate of CYP2D6, and in vitro and ex vivo studies as well 
as PBBK modelling of clinical data did not exclude a potential low to moderate risk for DDIs between 
treosulfan and CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 substrates. 
2.2.4.  Toxicology  
An  overview  of  toxicological  studies  considered  for  the  nonclinical  safety  assessment  of  treosulfan  is 
provided.

Single dose toxicity 
Treosulfan  demonstrated  low  acute  toxicity  when  administered  intravenously  (i.v.),  orally  (p.o.)  or 
subcutaneously (s.c.) to mice and rats. No lethality was induced in mice following an i.v. injection of up 
to 3500 mg/kg of treosulfan (LEO, 1978b). A comparison of the p.o. and s.c. LD50 values of treosulfan 
(> 3500 mg/kg) and busulfan (240 and 200 mg/kg, respectively) substantiates that treosulfan exhibits 
a considerably lower acute toxicity. Death of rats used in acute toxicity tests occurred within 4 to 6 days 
after dosing. Details on symptoms or pathological findings were not reported (LEO, 1978b). 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies for treosulfan with intravenous administration, the intended clinical route, 
were  performed  in  rats,  dogs  and  monkeys,  while  limited  information  on  tolerability  in  mice  can  be 
deduced from the primary pharmacology programme. 
Dose-dependent haematological changes were observed after repeated i.v., i.p. or p.o. administration 
in  mice,  rats,  dogs,  and  monkeys.  These  effects  are  generally  expected  for  alkylating  agents  (White, 
1962; LEO, 1978b; LPT 26054, 2011; LPT 37259, 2020). 
Within historical toxicity studies, with lethality reporting only, treosulfan was administered i.p. once daily 
over  5  days  to  rats  of  two  different  strains.  In  Holtzman  rats,  the  highest  non-lethal  dose  was  1113 
mg/kg, in Fischer rats 278 mg/kg. The LD50 were calculated with approximately 1364 and 696 mg/kg, 
respectively (LEO, 1978b). 
Results of a more recent GLP-compliant study on tolerability of subchronic daily intravenous treosulfan 
administrations in juvenile rats starting on PND 10 are summarised. The 26-day treatment period was

followed  by  a  post-treatment  observation  /  recovery  period  of  5  weeks.  A  complete  reversibility  was 
noted for all systemic changes observed during the treatment period for female rats. Only a slight delay 
of the physical development of the high dosed juvenile male rats (100 mg treosulfan/kg b.w./day) was 
noted (LPT 26054, 2011).  
Within a recently conducted GLP compliant 4-week subchronic toxicity study, rats were treated with 10, 
50, and 150 mg treosulfan. Haematological changes, related to the pharmacodynamic properties of the 
cytostatic drug treosulfan were observed starting at the low dose levels of 10 mg/kg b.w./day. At the 
end of the treatment period, a high number of erythrocytes and/or a high haemoglobin concentration 
were analysed in the urine of male animals treated. 
Animals  in  high  dose  groups  (150  mg  treosulfan/kg  b.w./day)  presented  additional  signs  of  systemic 
toxicity like decreased body weights and decreased absolute and relative spleen and thymus weights. 
The weight decrease of the spleen correlated to a lymphoid atrophy. No histopathological correlate was 
found  for  the  thymus  weight  decrease.  The  histopathological  examination  revealed  test  item  related 
lymphohistiocytic infiltration in the skeletal muscle starting at 10 mg treosulfan/kg b.w./day, urothelial 
hypertrophy  with  atypical  cells  in  the  urinary  bladder  starting  at  50  mg/kg  b.w./day;  increased  fatty 
bone marrow and decreased red bone marrow; lymphoid atrophy of the spleen and decreased incidence 
of lymphoid hyperplasia of lymph nodes at 150 mg/kg b.w./day.  
All changes noted for the clinical chemistry parameters and the organ weights had completely subsided 
at the end of the 2 week treatment-free recovery period. The body weights of the high dosed animals 
were still slightly reduced but revealed a tendency towards normalisation. 
Changes  in  haematological  parameters  were  still  noted  and  urinalysis  still  revealed  a  high  number  of 
erythrocytes  and/or  a  high  haemoglobin  concentration  in  the  urine  of  the  male  animals  at  the 
intermediate  and  high  dose  levels.  Histopathology  still  revealed  a  lymphohistiocytic  infiltration  in  the 
skeletal muscle starting at 10 mg/kg b.w./day and urothelial hypertrophy with atypical cells in the urinary 
bladder at 50 and 150 mg/kg b.w./day. The changes in the bone marrow, spleen and lymph nodes were 
reversible at the end of the 2 week treatment-free recovery period. In addition, a necrosis of myofibers 
in the skeletal muscle was noted at the end of the recovery period. 
Considering  the  afore  mentioned  findings,  the  no  observed  effect  level  (NOEL)  was  below  10  mg/kg 
b.w./day. 
In a historical chronic toxicity study in Leo Wistar rats, treosulfan (5 and 50 mg/kg/day) or busulfan (1 
mg/kg/day) were administered orally by gavage 6 days per week over 7 months. Treatment resulted in 
reduced body weight in the high-dose treosulfan group. Body weights and the number of neutrophilic 
granulocytes in peripheral blood were reduced in the busulfan group. 
Findings regarding organ weights, gross pathology or histopathology revealed effects on the male and 
female  reproductive  organs  (gonads  and  ovaries)  in  all  treatment  groups.  No  abnormalities  were 
observed for liver, kidney, lung, heart, spleen, adrenals and prostate or uterus compared to controls. 
Overall,  toxicity  was  less  pronounced  in  treosulfan-treated  compared  to  busulfan-treated  rats.  A  No 
Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) was not established for both compounds in this study. Treatment 
was tolerated without lethality (LEO, 1978b). 
Limited information on tolerability in mice can be deduced from the primary pharmacology programme. 
Tolerability in Beagle dogs was investigated following daily i.v. (56, 111, 222 or 445 mg/kg) or p.o. (56, 
111,  222,  445,  890  or  1779  mg/kg)  administrations  of  treosulfan  for  5  to  19  consecutive  days.  The 
duration of treatment was dependent on survival. All three animals dosed i.v. with 222 or 445 mg/kg/day 
developed  general  signs  of  systemic  intolerance,  described  as  CNS-depression,  malaise,  weight  loss, 
anorexia,  and  collapse  of  peripheral  circulation,  leading  to  death  on  Day  11  or  Day  12.  The

haematopoietic  system  was  affected  at  all  dose  levels  as  evidenced  by  leukopenia,  neutropenia,  and 
bone marrow depression. Reticulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia were observed at the 
dose 111 mg/kg/day or higher. Post-mortal findings included decreased cellularity of bone marrow and 
signs of hyperaemia starting at 56 mg/kg/day. Animals dosed with 222 mg/kg/day or higher showed 
severe haemorrhagic lesions in several organs and atrophy of the spleen (LEO, 1978b). A NOAEL was 
not  established  in  the  dog  studies.  The  maximum  tolerated  dose  (MTD)  based  on  lethality  was  111 
mg/kg/day for i.v. (LEO, 1978b). 
Rhesus monkeys received treosulfan i.v. (56, 111, 222 or 445 mg/kg) or p.o. (56, 111, 222, 445, 890 
or  1779  mg/kg)  once  daily  for  6  to  19  consecutive  days.  Duration  of  treatment  was  dependent  on 
survival.  Starting  at  222  mg/kg/day  of  i.v.  treatment,  the  monkeys  showed  signs  of  intolerability 
including  a  symptom  described  as  CNS-depression,  malaise,  emesis,  severe  diarrhoea,  anorexia,  and 
collapse of peripheral circulation. These animals died on Day 8 to Day 13. Monkeys in all dose groups 
developed  reticulocytopenia,  leukopenia,  and  bone  marrow  depression.  Weight  loss  and  lymphopenia 
were observed in all animals starting at 111 mg/kg. Haemoconcentration was seen after 222 and 445 
mg/kg/day.  At  necropsy,  decrease  in  cellularity  of  bone  marrow  (all  groups),  atrophy  of  spleen  and 
lymph  nodes  (at  111  mg/kg/day  and  above),  and  haemorrhagic  lesions,  especially  in  the  gastro-
intestinal tract, were noted (LEO, 1978b). Monkeys dosed with 111 or 222 mg/kg/day were sacrificed in 
moribund condition on Days 18 and 13, respectively. Monkeys dosed with 445 mg/kg/day or higher died 
on Days 6 to 10. Animals in all dose groups developed reticulocytopenia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, and 
bone  marrow  depression.  At  222  mg/kg/day  or  higher,  haemoconcentration  was  noted.  Higher  doses 
induced  atrophy  of  lymph  nodes  and  haemorrhages  in  the  adrenal  cortex,  bladder  mucosa  and  lung 
(LEO, 1978b). 
A NOAEL was not established in the monkey studies. The MTD based on lethality was 111 mg/kg/day for 
the i.v. route (LEO, 1978b).  
Genotoxicity 
Transformation of treosulfan to the reactive epoxides EBDM and DEB is a prerequisite for the genotoxic 
properties of treosulfan. Due to the presence of two versus one nucleophilic centres, reactions of DEB 
with DNA is much more efficient compared to EBDM (Gherezghiher et al., 2013; Hartley et al., 1999; 
Michaelson-Richie et al., 2010; Millard et al., 2006; Park et al., 2005). 
Treosulfan up to the 3160 μg per plate was tested with and without metabolic activation in the Ames 
reverse mutation test, using four Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537 and 
in  one  Escherichia  coli  strain  WP2  uvrA.  Treosulfan  caused  with  and  without  metabolic  activation  a 
concentration-related base-pair substitution mutagenic effect in the S. typhimurium strains TA100 and 
TA1535 (Provivo 38665, 2022). These results are supported by literature, where, treosulfan and DEB 
showed  a  pH-dependent  spectrum  of  mutagenic  responses  in  the  Ames  test  (S.  typhimurium  strains 
TA100,  TA102,  TA1535,  TA7004,  TA7005;  Abu-Shakra  et  al.,  2000;  Zeiger  and  Pagano,  1989).  Both 
compounds were mutagenic at the gpt locus in Chinese hamster ovary cells (Zhu and Zeiger, 1993). 
A  potential  to  induce  sister  chromatid  exchanges  in  human  lymphocytes  was  demonstrated  with 
treosulfan in vitro (Clare et al., 1982). 
In  an  in  vitro  cytogenetic  study  using  human  lymphocyte  cultures  treosulfan  tested  up  to  50  μg/ml 
revealed mutagenic properties with respect to chromosomal or chromatid damage in the absence as well 
as presence of metabolic activation (Provivo 38666, 2022). The results are in accordance with literature 
data,  where  induction  of  micronuclei  or  chromosomal  aberrations  in  bone  marrow  cells  of  mice  was 
shown  for  treosulfan  doses  of  250  to  1000  mg/kg  administered  i.p.  Similarily,  DEB  gave  a  positive 
Assessment report

response in the bone marrow micronucleus test and dominant lethal test (effect on implantation rate) in 
mice treated i.p. with of 36 mg/kg (Adler et al., 1997; Shelby et al., 1989). 
Carcinogenicity 
According to the ICH S9 and ICH S1A guidelines unequivocally genotoxic compounds implying a hazard 
to  humans  are  not  to  be  subjected  to  long-term  carcinogenicity  studies  (ICH  guidelines).  Therefore, 
specific carcinogenicity studies in animals were not performed with treosulfan. 
Reproduction toxicity 
According to the ICH guideline S9 on nonclinical evaluation for anticancer pharmaceuticals, reproductive 
and developmental toxicity studies are not considered essential for pharmaceuticals that are genotoxic, 
target rapidly dividing cells in general toxicity studies (e.g., crypt cells, bone marrow), or in case they 
belong  to  a  class  that  has  been  well  characterized  as  causing  developmental  toxicity.  All  of  these 
conditions apply to treosulfan. Therefore, no dedicated reproductive and developmental toxicity studies 
for treosulfan addressing the fertility, early embryonic or embryo-fetal, pre- and postnatal development 
including maternal function were conducted.  
Nevertheless, subchronic toxicity of treosulfan was investigated in juvenile and young adult rats. The 
effect  of  intravenously  administered  treosulfan  on  development  of  juvenile  rats  was  investigated  in  a 
more recent GLP-compliant subchronic study with juvenile Sprague-Dawley rats. Ten animals per sex 
were treated i.v. with daily doses of 10, 50 or 100 mg/kg of treosulfan from PND 10 to 35. Body weights 
of  high-dose  males  and  females  were  markedly  reduced.  Haematological  changes  included  reduced 
numbers  of  leucocytes  and  neutrophile  granulocytes  in  all  dose  groups.  Urinalysis,  ophthalmological 
examination,  auditory  examination,  and  macroscopic  post  mortem  findings  revealed  no  effects 
attributable to treosulfan treatment. Relative to body weight, weights of gonads, prostate, spleen, and 
thymus were reduced in high dosed rats and a slightly delayed time-point of vaginal opening was noted 
for  the  high  dosed  female  animals.  After  a  5-week  post-treatment  observation  period,  only  a  slightly 
decreased body weight and the correlating reduced organ weights in high dosed males indicated a slight 
delay of physical development. Ten of 60 satellite animals of a 250 mg/kg/day dose group dedicated for 
pharmacokinetic investigations died prematurely on PND 19 to 30. The cause of death was not further 
examined. Most likely, a combined effect of treosulfan toxicity and weakening by frequent blood drawings 
resulted in a moribund state of the young adult rats (LPT 26054, 2011). 
Studies with the transformation product DEB in mice and rats confirmed the potential of treosulfan to 
affect uterine-ovarian development and implantation as well as sperm development. 
In  pregnant  rats,  DEB  reduced  foetal  growth  and  viability  and  induced  implantation  losses  and  foetal 
resorption  (Chi  et  al.,  2002;  Doerr  et  al.,  1996;  Marchetti  and  Wyrobek,  2008).  DEB  also  induced 
depletion  of  spermatids,  reduction  of  the  secondary  spermatocyte  layers,  and  altered  chromatin 
packaging in sperms of mice treated with a single i.p. dose of up to 78 mg/kg and followed up for up to 
4 weeks (Spanò et al., 1996). 
In  another  study  with  i.p.  doses  of  up  to  85  mg/kg  on  Day  1,  3,  and  5,  DEB  induced  signs  of  male 
reproductive toxicity including abnormal forms of sperms, reduced sperm motility, and accumulation of 
testicular cells in the G2/M phase. In a mouse premeiotic spermatocyte-derived cell line, DEB induced 
signs of genotoxic effects after incubation with 100 to 500 μM DEB (Dong et al., 2015). 
Considering  the  substance  class  as  well  as  the  mode  of  action,  treosulfan  must  be  assumed  a  drug 
possessing all aspects of reproductive and developmental toxicity.

Toxicokinetic data 
Three dedicated GLP compliant toxicokinetic studies in rats were performed using i.v. administration of 
treosulfan. One study was conducted as part of a 4-week toxicity study in adult rats (LPT 37259, 2020), 
a  second  one  in  juvenile  rats  treated  from  PND  10  to  35  (LPT  26054,  2011).  The  third  study  was 
performed as single-dose toxicity study in juvenile and young adult rats (LPT 27700, 2014). For results 
of  toxicokinetic  evaluations  of  treosulfan  after  single  dose  and  repeat-dose  treatment  refer  to  CTD 
Section 2.4.4 and 2.6.5.3.2 and 2.6.5.4. These data reveal a linear dose relationship with AUC in adult 
rats.  Accordingly,  toxicity  findings  including  laboratory  and  histopathological  changes  are  exposure 
related.  
Local tolerance 
Intraarterial  or  perivenous  administration  of  a  clinical-grade  formulation  of  treosulfan  to  the  ears  of 
rabbits  were  tolerated  without  signs  of  local  lesions.  No  remarkable  local  findings  were  reported 
regarding the injection sites in the animal studies with i.v. or i.p. administration (LEO, 1985). 
Other toxicity studies 
Photosafety 
No  nonclinical  photosafety  studies  were  performed  because  treosulfan  exhibits  no  significant  light 
absorption at wave lengths in the range of 290 nm to 700 nm.  
Antigenicity 
Antigenicity has not been described for treosulfan. 
Immunogenicity 
No formal non-clinical immunogenicity studies have been conducted.  
Dependence 
Dependence on treosulfan has not been studied, and there is no evidence of treosulfan dependence. But 
given the indications for treatment with treosulfan as conditioning regimen prior to HSCT, the mode of 
action and the adverse drug reactions of treosulfan, dependence and abuse can be ruled out. 
Studies on Metabolites 
Studies with the treosulfan metabolite DEB confirmed the expected cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in vitro 
and  in  vivo.  Furthermore,  effects  of  DEB  on  male  and  female  reproductive  organs  and  functions 
corroborate that the alkylating activity of the treosulfan related epoxides are responsible for both the 
pharmacodynamic  activity  and  toxicities  including  mutagenicity,  carcinogenicity  and  reproductive  and 
developmental toxicity. 
Maximum Tolerated Doses (MTD) and Systemic Exposure in Animals versus Humans 
The  maximum  tolerated  dose  (MTD)  regarding  severe  toxicity  including  lethality  after  single  dose 
treosulfan  administration  in  mouse  and  rats  was  about  10,000  and  15,000  mg/m2,  respectively. 
Repeated,  subchronic  intravenous  administration  to  rats  was  tested  up  to  a  maximum  dose  of  150 
mg/kg/day, corresponding to 900 mg/m2/day, only. In dogs and monkeys 111 mg/kg/day were tolerated 
when treated i.v. over a period of 10 to 14 and 8 to 19 days. In the Table below 2.4-4, the corresponding 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/117245/2023

animal doses in terms of mg/m2 body surface area (BSA) are compared with the MTD in adult patients 
of 12.5 mg/m2 (single dose without subsequent HSCT; refer to Harstrick et al., 1996). For conversion of 
dose  in  mg/kg  body  weight  to  dose  in  mg/m2  body  surface  area  standard  factors  according  to  FDA 
guidance were used (FDA, 2005). 
Apparently much higher doses are tolerated by humans than by animal species. However, in case the 
treosulfan  MTD  of  47  g/m²  of  human  exposure  is  considered  with  subsequent  HSCT  the  ratio  MTD 
animal/human is about 0.2. 
Table 2.4-4: Comparison of the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) for treosulfan in toxicology studies and 
in humans 
The maximum tolerated single dose of i.v. applied treosulfan in humans is 12.5 g/m2. When 
overcoming this pronounced haematotoxicity of higher doses by HSCT, the treosulfan dose can be 
increased 4- to 5-fold to a MTD of 47 g/m2. Considering the proposed indication of treosulfan 
“conditioning prior to HSCT” which is characterised by the administration of an otherwise lethal 
treosulfan dose, the assessment of a usual safety margin might be somewhat misleading. 
2.2.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An ERA report was prepared in accordance with the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of 
Medicinal Products for Human Use, EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2, 2006 and Questions and answers 
document on the Guideline, EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010 Rev.1, 2016. 
A  Phase  I  ERA  has  been  provided  for  the  extension  of  indication  to  include  additional  non-malignant 
transplant indications (non-malignant diseases in the paediatric population) for Trecondi 1 g/5 g powder 
for solution for infusion. 
1.  The  Phase  I  of  the  environmental  risk  assessment  requires  the  calculation  of  the  predicted 
environmental concentration of treosulfan in surface water. For PEC calculation, the MAH referred to

the 
formulas  given 
in 
the  guidelines  EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00  corr  2,  2006  and 
EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010 Rev.1, 2016. 
Fpen and PECsurfacewater refined values, in line with the Guidelines are endorsed. 
Since PECsurfacewater of 0.003 µg/L is evidently below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L, the environmental 
risk assessment can stop in Phase I, in agreement with EMA Guideline EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 
2, 2006. 
2.  Experimental log Kow values for treosulfan and its epoxides, of -1.58, -1.18 and -0.40, were far below 
the trigger value of 4.5, for further screening of persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity (PBT).  Log 
Kow values were experimentally determined using the shake-flask method (OCDE 107), according to 
EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010 Rev. 1, 2016, and the original study was provided by the MAH (Glówka, 
Romanski and Siemiatkowska, 2013). Thus, no formal PBT assessment is required. 
According  to  EMA  guidelines,  if  the  PECsurfacewater  value  is  below  0.01  μg/L,  and  no  other 
environmental concerns are apparent, it is assumed that the medicinal product is unlikely to represent 
a  risk  for  the  environment  following  its  prescribed  usage.  Furthermore,  the  octanol-water  partition 
coefficient (log Kow) far below 4.5 indicating that the risk of bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms is 
low. Phase II ERA is deemed not necessary, in agreement with EMA Guideline. 
In summary, Trecondi 1 g/5 g powder for solution for infusion is not predicted to present a risk to the 
environment, following its prescribed usage. 
3. The precautionary and safety measures taken to reduce any risk to the environment on the SmPC 
and PL have been applied and are considerable acceptable. 
2.2.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
 Pharmacology 
Treosulfan  has  known  cytotoxic,  myeloablative  and  immunesuppressive  effects  whichconstitute  the 
mechanism  of  action  of  this  prodrug  supporting  the  approved  and  the  extended  indication,  i.e. 
conditioning treatment prior to allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). 
Under physiological conditions, treosulfan is converted to reactive intermediates which alkylate DNA and 
create inter-strand cross-links besides affecting also other biological molecules and structures involved 
in  various  physiological  functions.  Its  myeloablative  and  immunosuppressive  effects  were  shown  in 
various in vitro and in vivo models with treosulfan alone or combined with other conditioning regimens 
such as fludarabine or cyclophosphamide, total body (thymus in particular) irradiation (TBI) or anti-T 
cell antibodies. The clinical development of treosulfan-based conditioning, however, is focused on the 
combination with fludarabine for additional pre-transplant immunosuppression. 
Treosulfan  has  a  high  potential  to  eliminate  a  broad  range  of  haematopoietic  progenitor  cell  subsets 
when administered in repeat-dose treatment regimens, which facilitates the induction of high levels of 
engraftment  and  donor-type  chimerism  after  allogeneic  HSCT.  It  also  exhibits  a  strong 
immunosuppressive potential which is required to suppress acute recipient mediated allograft rejection.  
From  the  information  provided  the  conclusion  that  the  safety  pharmacology  studies  on  treosulfan 
provided no evidence of clinically relevant adverse effects is supported. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/117245/2023

Appropriate  analytical  methods  were  developed  and  validated  for  the  detection  of  treosulfan  and  its 
transformation products EBDM and DEB in aqueous solutions, biological fluids and tissues. As treosulfan 
does not undergo conjugation with GSH, it prevents interpatient variability of drug clearance due to GST 
activity,  GSH  depletion,  and  interactions  or  competition  with  GSH  conjugated  drugs.  Nevertheles, 
metabolic phenotyping identified treosulfan as a substrate of CYP2D6, and in vitro and ex-vivo studies 
did not exclude a potential DDI between treosulfan and CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 substrates; this cautionary 
wording is already included in PI and was not changed in the scope of this variation. 
Treosulfan  and  its  active  metabolites  were  rapidly  metabolised  and  eliminated,  mainly  via  renal 
excretion. The kinetics of biotransformation is strongly dependent on the pH which is highly regulated in 
the in vivo system. No relevant sex differences have been observed and there is no indication for an 
accumulation in blood or any tissues after repeated exposure. The predominant distribution of treosulfan 
in primary lymphatic organs probably facilitates its myeloablative potential.  
Toxicology 
Toxicity studies revealed occasional gastro-intestinal effects including emesis and diarrhoea as well as 
haematuria  and  lymphohistiocytic  infiltration  in  the  skeletal  muscle.  However,  exposure  of  different 
animal species to treosulfan did not reveal dose-limiting functional or structural changes regarding liver, 
kidneys, the cardiovascular, respiratory, or central nervous system. Some of these observations are also 
reflected in the list of adverse reactions included in the SmPC for both adult and paediatric population. 
Overall, systemic toxicity upon treosulfan administration seems to be similar among the animal species 
employed in the nonclinical toxicological program and is independent of the route of administration. The 
observed  haematotoxic  and  immunotoxic  effects  of  treosulfan,  at  least,  should  be  overcome  after 
subsequent HSCT as well known from clinical experience.  
Treosulfan, as other alkylating drugs, is mutagenic and provides a carcinogenic potential in animals and 
humans. Accordingly, a warning of the risk of secondary malignancies after treatment with treosulfan is 
already included in the approved SmPC and was not changed in the scope of this variation.  
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  MAH  submitted  an  ERA  Phase  I  arising  from  the  use  of  Trecondi  1g/5g  powder  for  solution  for 
infusion, according to on the guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for 
Human  Use  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00,  June  2006)  and  the  Questions  and  Answers  on  Guideline on 
the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use (EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010 
Rev. 1, 2016). 
Fpen has been refined based on prevalence data, and the PECsurfacewater value of 0.003 µg/L is far 
below the action limit of 0.01 µg/l.  Regarding screening on persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity, 
the provided experimental log Kow values for treosulfan and its epoxides, of -1.58, -1.18 and -0.40, are 
far below the trigger value of 4.5. Thus, there is no need for further assessment of potential persistence, 
bioaccumulation and toxicity (PBT). 
The provided data are acceptable and the risk assessment stopped in Phase I of the procedure. Trecondi 
1g/5g powder for solution for infusion, following its prescribed usage, is unlikely to represent a risk for 
the environment. 
The precautionary and safety measures taken to reduce any risk to the environment on the SmPC and 
PL have been applied.

Assessment of paediatric data on non-clinical aspects 
Histopathological examinations on juvenile or adult rats revealed no necrotic or inflammatory lesions in 
the liver, kidneys, heart, lungs or adrenals. Complete reversibility of haematological effects and delay of 
post-natal development was demonstrated in the study in juvenile rats with only a slight delay of the 
physical development. 
Minor signs of toxicity were noted in the subchronic toxicity study when juvenile rats were treated with 
a maximum intravenous dose of 100 mg/kg/day. A slightly decreased ALAT plasma activity (-20% to -
30%)  is  considered  toxicologically  not  relevant  in  the  absence  of  evidence  for  corresponding  signs  of 
organ dysfunctions or morphological tissue lesions.  
Functional differences of maturing BBB, which results in a higher permeability of BBB in juvenile 
animals compared to adults, induced a higher ratio of treosulfan concentrations in brain versus plasma 
in juvenile animals. However, penetration of BBB is overall at a low level in both juvenile as well as 
adult rats. This finding is consistent with the comparably low frequency of clinical observations on 
CNS-related toxicities. In juvenile rats, treosulfan plasma half-life was slightly prolonged and the 
exposure is higher compared to young adults when dosed intravenously on a mg/kg body weight 
calculation. This information is already included in the approved PI and was not changed in the scope 
of this variation. Moreover, the clinical relevance of this finding is adequately addressed by the 
established BSA related dose calculation for treosulfan in children, which based on PK data was 
updated in PI. 
2.2.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The nonclinical safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic data provided for treosulfan is considered adequate 
to  support  the  application  for  the  extension  of  the  indication  to  conditioning  treatment  prior  to 
haematopoietic  progenitor  cell  transplantation  in  paediatric  patients  with  non-malignant  diseases. 
Relevant  information  is  already  reflected  in  the  current  SmPC  and  no  changes  have  been  introduced 
within this variation. 
Based on the updated data submitted in this application, the extended indication, to include additional 
non-malignant transplant indications (non-malignant diseases in the paediatric population), for 
Trecondi 1 g/5 g powder for solution for infusion does not lead to a significant increase in 
environmental exposure further to the use of treosulfan. Treosulfan should be used according to the 
precautions stated in the SmPC in order to minimize any potential risks to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
In the scope of this variation application the MAH intends to extent the indication to include additional 
non-malignant transplant indications (non-malignant diseases in the paediatric population) for Trecondi 
1  g/5  g  powder  for  solution  for  infusion  based  on  final  12-months  follow-up results  of  the  study  MC-
FludT.16/NM;  a  randomised  phase  II  interventional  study  aimed  to  compare  Treosulfan-based 
conditioning  therapy  with  Busulfan-based  conditioning  prior  to  allogeneic  haematopoietic  stem  cell 
transplantation in paediatric patients with non-malignant diseases.

Further, the MAH proposes to amend an existing warning on skin toxicity based on new literature data. 
In  a  recent  publication  from  Even-Or  et  al.  2020  1  regarding  skin  toxicities  (e.g.  rash,  dermatitis) 
following  TREO-thiotepa-FLU-based  conditioning  regimen  in  non-malignant  paediatric  patients,  an 
increase of skin disorders was observed when patients received sodium bicarbonate-containing hydration 
in the course of TREO infusion. The MAH postulated that this effect could be due to the acceleration of 
the pH-dependent formation of alkylating epoxides. The effect may be prevented by keeping the skin 
clean and dry on days of treosulfan infusion. Therefore, the MAH suggested to include this information 
in medac’s SmPC as follows: 
Moreover, the MAH proposes to introduce a slightly modified dosing regimen according to the patient’s 
body surface based on long-term follow-up data of paediatric study MC-FludT.17/M; a Phase II trial 
to  describe  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  Treosulfan  based  conditioning  therapy  prior  to  allogeneic 
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in paediatric patients with haematological malignancies, as well 
as  a  final  analysis  of  the  population  pharmacokinetics  of  Treosulfan  in  paediatric  patients.  As  a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are proposed to be updated. 
Treosulfan (TREO) is an analogue of busulfan (BU) differing by two additional hydroxyl groups in positions 
2 and 3. These two additional hydroxyl groups confer water-soluble properties allowing TREO dissolution 
in aqueous media in the contrary to BU. Though resembling BU in chemical formula, there are a number 
of important differences. In contrast to BU, which directly (“primarily”) alkylates thiols, TREO has to be 
converted  non-enzymatically,  but  pH-dependent  to  alkylating  monoepoxide  intermediates  and  L-
diepoxybutane, which are considered responsible for the alkylating and cytotoxic effects [Fennelly 1979].  
Treosulfan is a bifunctional alkylating agent which has been shown to possess antineoplastic activity in 
the animal tumour screen and in clinical trials. Since many years the clinical usefulness of TREO in the 
treatment of ovarian cancer has been proved within several Phase II and Phase III studies.  
Currently,  TREO  is  approved  in  several  European  countries  (DE,  DK,  IE,  NL,  UK)  for  the  palliative 
treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer. It is available as powder for solution for injection or infusion as 
well as capsules for oral use. The usual intravenous (IV) dose in this indication is 8 g/m2 given every 3- 
4 weeks if used as a single agent and 5 g/m2 if combined with cisplatin.  
Furthermore, TREO has been tested in phase II trials for several other tumour types, including small cell 
lung cancer, breast cancer, malignant melanoma, and as a stem cell toxic agent within a conditioning 
regimen before autologous or allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.  
On  20  June  2019,  TREO  (trade  name  Trecondi®)  was  approved  in  the  European  Union  for  the 
conditioning  treatment  prior  to  allogeneic  haematopoietic  stem  cell  transplantation  (alloHSCT).  In 
Switzerland, Trecondi® was approved on 10 August 2020. In Canada, TREO (trade name Trecondyv®) 
was approved on July 28, 2021.  
Treosulfan  is  indicated  as  part  of  conditioning  treatment  prior  to  alloHSCT  in  malignant  and  non-
malignant diseases in adults up to the age of 70 years and paediatric patients older than one month in 
non-malignant  diseases.  HSCT  involves  the  intravenous  infusion  of  autologous  or  allogeneic 
haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) collected from bone marrow, peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood

to re-establish haematopoietic function in patients with damaged or defective bone marrow or immune 
system.  This  procedure  is  often  performed  as  part  of  therapy  to  eliminate  a bone  marrow  infiltrative 
process such as leukaemia, or to correct congenital immunodeficiency disorders. In addition, HSCT is 
used  to  allow  patients  with  cancer  to  receive  higher  doses  of  chemotherapy  than  bone  marrow  can 
usually  tolerate;  bone  marrow  function  is  then  salvaged  by  replacing  the  marrow  with  previously 
harvested HSCs (autoHSCT). Allogeneic HSCT can be a curative option for some malignant conditions, 
bone  marrow  failure,  hereditary  metabolic  disorders,  and  severe  congenital  immunodeficiencies  that 
would otherwise have been fatal.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
As  a  requirement  of  the  EMA/PDCO  approved  paediatric  investigational  plan  (PIP)  for  Treosulfan,  the 
MAH had to analyse all available PK data on paediatric uses of Treosulfan and to conduct two clinical 
transplantation studies in paediatric patient populations.  
Study MC-FludT.16/NM was conducted in children of different age groups with non-malignant diseases 
requiring myeloablative conditioning treatment prior to AlloHSCT to describe the safety and efficacy of 
Treosulfan-based conditioning therapy compared to Busulfan-based conditioning therapy.  
Study  MC-FludT.17/M  was  conducted  in  children  of  different  age  groups  with  haematological 
malignancies requiring myeloablative conditioning treatment prior AlloHSCT to describe the safety and 
efficacy of Treosulfan-based conditioning therapy.  
PK  data  were  analyzed  in  a  sufficient  sized  subset  of  subjects  enrolled  in  studies MC-FludT.16/NM 
and MC-FludT.17/M. Further details about these studies can be found in the clinical trial protocols.  
Both medac-sponsored trials contributed to the initially built population PK model (December 2011) for 
Treosulfan. This model was based on PK data acquired in 7 different historical studies from mostly adults 
and only a limited number of children. The model was used to evaluate and predict the pharmacokinetics 
of Treosulfan in children and is described in Pop PK report. By this model, disposition of Treosulfan was 
described by two compartments and linear kinetics. A covariate analysis was performed and detected 
body surface area (BSA) as the only clinically relevant covariate for clearance and volumes of distribution 
of Treosulfan. The model was used to establish dose recommendations for Treosulfan in children based 
on  BSA.  Using  the  final  PK  data  from  both  new  paediatric  studies,  the  current  dose  recommendation 
based on BSA will be validated or updated, if necessary. 
Data used  
For the final analysis, data of 24 subjects from study MC-FludT.16/NM and of 59 subjects from study 
MC-FludT.17/M were available for analysis and their stratification is visible in table 2: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/117245/2023  
Page 43/183 
 
 
 
 
 
Covariate data were provided by the sponsor according to the DTS. In the two novel studies BSA was 
calculated using the formula from Mosteller. The GFR was estimated according to the Schwartz formula 
using serum creatinine and patient’s body height. 
For subjects with missing dosing date or dosing time, the affected records were flagged and dosing time 
was imputed using scheduled dosing date or time. For subjects with missing sampling date or sampling 
time, the affected records were flagged and excluded from the analysis. By default, missing covariates 
were  imputed  by  the  last  observation  carried  forward  (LOCF)  method,  except  for  baseline  values  for 
which backward propagation was used, if feasible. If for a covariate no information was available for a 
subject,  the  median  value  of  the  missing  covariate  was  imputed  for  continuous  covariates,  while  for 
discrete covariates the most frequent value was used. Extreme and unexpected individual data points 
(“outliers”) were excluded if they had a considerable impact on the modelling results. Decisions were 
based on model-free exploratory outlier analysis of individual concentration curves and/or on conditional 
weighted  residuals  and  combined  profile  plots  per  treatment  from  intermediate  modelling  results. 
Reasons for exclusion are described in the report. Excluded data are re-included in the final model to 
evaluate the impact of exclusion(s) on the parameter estimates and model performance. 
METHODS 
Non-linear  mixed  effects  modelling  was  performed  using  the  software  NONMEMxvi.  Results  were 
analysed and graphically displayed by means of the statistical software package Rxvii (version 3.2.2). 
Compilation  of  NONMEM  executable  files  were  performed  by  using  the  FORTRAN  compiler  gfortran 
(version 4.5.0). The same software environment was used for conducting visual predictive checks (VPC) 
and simulations. For simulation, the random seed in NONMEM were set to an arbitrary 8-digits number. 
SAS  and  R  for  Windows  were  used  for  data  handling  and  additional  statistics.  Throughout  model 
development, the first-order conditional estimate approximation with interaction (FOCE INTERACTION) 
was used for estimation. 
A  Pop  PK  or  mixed-effects  model  was  previously  developed  to  describe  blood  concentrations  of 
Treosulfan,  and  to  perform  a  covariate  analysis.  The  initially  developed  Pop  PK  model  describing 
disposition of Treosulfan comprises two compartments (with dosing in the central compartment) with 
linear intercompartmental clearance and elimination. A diagram of its structure is displayed in Figure 1. 
This  structure  was  unchanged  for  the  updated  model,  unless  there  were  strong  indications  that  the 
structure should be changed.

In the initially developed Pop PK model, inter-individual variability on pharmacokinetic parameters was 
assumed to be log-normally distributed. IIV was investigated for each parameter and was included in 
the  model  if  it  led  to  an  improvement  in  OFV  after  a  successful  minimization  and  covariance  step. 
Furthermore,  additional  criteria  like  condition  number,  goodness-of-fit  plots,  and  IIV  of  remaining 
parameters  were  considered  as  well.  The  residual  error,  which  accounts  for  unexplained  errors  (e.g. 
measurement  and  experimental  errors,  or  model  misspecification  to  some  extent)  in  the  plasma 
concentrations, was described by the constant CV + constant additive error model. 
In the initially developed Pop PK model, BSA was implemented as a covariate on volume of distribution 
of  the  central  compartment  (V1),  volume  of  distribution  of  the  peripheral  compartment  (V2),  and 
clearance (CL). Unless during model development strong indications were present that this needed to be 
changed, these covariate relations were kept in the model. To determine the final covariate model, the 
following  covariates  were  considered  for  testing:  age,  body  weight,  body  height,  BSA,  GFR  (CCG), 
gender, background conditioning regimen, study (site ID), data indicator (historical or new data). The 
Stepwise Covariate Model (SCM) building tool of PsN was used for covariate selection. Before running 
the SCM method, correlations between covariates were analysed. For highly correlated covariates, e.g. 
body weight with BSA, only one was considered for the first forward-backward analysis. The other was 
reconsidered in a second analysis. During the forward inclusion stage, covariates were added until no 
significant relations at the 0.05 level remain; during the backward deletion stage, significance was tested 
at the 0.01 level. The impact of covariates was also judged by the decrease in inter-subject variability, 
general appearance of goodness-of-fit plots, effect size of the covariate on the particular parameter, and 
physiologic plausibility. 
The  model’s  ability  to  describe  and  predict  observed  data  was  assessed  by  a  variety  of  numerical, 
statistical, and graphical methods. Among them were evaluation of OFV, goodness-of-fit plots, analysis 
of  residuals,  VPCs,  and  scientific  plausibility  of  parameter  estimates.  As  much  as  possible  standard 
methods available in PsN were used. 
Simulations using the two types of models (Dosing Model (the initial model) and Updated Model) were 
used for model evaluations and dose recommendations. The following rationale was given for dosing, 
with an objective AUC of 1355 ug×h/mL.

•  No relation between AUC and (time to) engraftment was observed in the AUC range of 760-3600 
ug×h/mL. 
•  Dosing according to an objective AUC < 1355 ug×h/mL increases the risk that AUC  for some 
subjects will be lower than 760 yg×h/mL (i.e., outside the range for which time to engraftment 
versus AUC information is available). 
RESULTS 
The  initial  Dosing  Model  was  finalised  with  data  derived  from  studies  MC-FludT.16/NM  and  MC-
FludT.17/M. To compensate for the different bioanalytical methods used for acquiring the historical and 
newly obtained data an additional model parameter was estimated to allow a proportional shift of the 
data derived from studies MC-FludT.16/NM and MC-FludT.17/M towards the historical data. Using the 
same  statistical  model  (IIV  on  all  model  parameters),  minimization  was  successful  with  successful 
covariance  step.  Diagnostic  plots  on  pooled  data  revealed  no  relevant  bias.  Hence,  it  was  decided  to 
retain its deterministic and statistical structure, and the model was chosen as base model. Inclusion of 
a sigmoidal age function scaling clearance in the base model had a modest effect on the model fit. The 
OFV dropped only by 5 points while the estimated maturation parameters (a TM50 value of 49 weeks 
(assuming a gestational age of 40 weeks) and a Hill coefficient of 6.6) indicated a rather abrupt effect 
appearing  at  a  relatively  young  age.  For  most  subjects  the  age  function  approached  1  and  for  those 
subjects  with  lower  values  the  effect  on  the  AUC  was  below  5%.  As  a  consequence,  no  maturation 
function was included at this stage of modelling. The base Pop PK model for Treosulfan on historical data 
and data from studies MCFludT.16/NM and MC-FludT.17/N is a two compartmental model with zero order 
infusion, and linear elimination and inter-compartmental clearance including an effect of BSA on CL, V1 
and V2. 
An exploratory covariate analysis was performed to get a general overview of the covariate data. The 
evaluated  categorical  covariates  were  gender  (SEX),  study  identifier  (STID),  data  indicator  (STFLAG, 
historical or new data), background conditioning regimen (CREG). The continuous covariates were body 
surface area (BSA), height (HGT), body weight (WGT), age (AGE) and glomerular filtration rate (CCG, 
creatinine clearance or glomerular filtration rate).  
Table 2: Summary of the continuous covariates 
Since the Dosing Model described historical data adequately and the current dosing scheme was based 
on BSA, the effect of BSA on CL, V1 and V2 was retained when additional covariate-parameter relations 
were tested. The following covariate-model parameter relations were tested in a full (forward inclusion 
and backward deletion) SCM analysis:

•  V1: SEX, STFLAG, AGE, CCG;  CL: SEX, STFLAG, AGE, CCG ; V2: SEX, STFLAG, AGE, CCG; Q: 
SEX, STFLAG, AGE, CCG, BSA 
Note that CCG contains the normalized GFR values for the new studies and the creatinine clearance or 
(normalized)  GFR  values  for  the  historical  studies.  The  SCM  analysis  was  performed  with  p=0.05  for 
forward inclusion and p=0.01 for backward deletion. The final backward model described an allometric 
effect of BSA on Q, CL, V1 and V2 and an effect of CCG on CL. Minimization of the final backward model 
exited successfully with successful covariance step. However, the effect of CCG on CL could not precisely 
be  estimated.  It  was  estimated  with  a  rather  large  RSE  value  of  33%.  Removing  CCG  on  CL  had  a 
minimal effect on the resulting AUC so it was decided also to remove this model-parameter-covariate 
relation from the final SCM model. 
The final Pop PK model for Treosulfan based on historical data, and data derived from the studies MC-
FludT.16/NM  and  MC-FludT.17/M  is  a  two  compartmental  model  (with  dosing  in  the  central 
compartment) with linear elimination and intercompartmental clearance, see Figure 1. IIV was included 
on  CL,  V1,  V2,  and  Q.  The  model  describes  an  effect  of  BSA  on  CL,  V1,  V2  and  Q 
(PK=TVPK*(BSA/1.75)theta  where  PK  represents  CL,  V1,  V2  or  Q).  Unexplained  residual  error  is 
described by a constant CV. To compensate for bioassay differences between historical and new data, a 
SHIFT model parameter was included describing this difference. Final model parameters and Numerical 
diagnostic measures are presented are listed in Table 12. Standard Goodness-of-Fit plots are presented 
in Figure 6. These plots revealed no model bias based on the pooled data. ETA shrinkage (shη) of V1, 
V2 and Q were high (between 27 and 44%). shη of CL and epsilon (shε) shrinkage were low (less than 
10%) as can be seen in Table 22. A representative selection of individual fits and visual predictive checks 
(VPC) are presented below.

In general, prediction of the Final Model improved compared to the prediction of the Dosing Model but 
the prediction of observed concentrations in subjects with BSA larger than 1 m2 (BSAgrp = 3) is still 
biased.  Concentrations  between  2  and  3  h  after  start  of  infusion  are  within  the  prediction  range  but 
almost all concentrations are above the median of the simulated concentrations. Concentrations at later 
timepoints are all centered around the median. 
SIMULATIONS 
Simulations were made in order to calculate the geometric mean and 95% prediction interval of AUCs 
(AUC∞  based  on  analytical  formula)  by  use  of  the  Updated  Model.  For  that  500  concentration-time 
profiles  were  simulated  and  distribution  of  simulated  AUC∞  based  on  posterior  estimates  of  CL  was

calculated.  Distributions  of  predicted  AUCinf  displayed  by  BSA  groups  are  shown  in  Figure 12.  For  all 
BSA groups, 0.77% of simulated AUCinf are below 760 and 0.03% above 3600 μg×h/mL. Since this is 
below  the  maximum  of  2.5%,  dose  adjustment  criterion  is  passed.  For  each  separate  BSA  group  the 
dose adjustment criterium is passed as well.

Dosing scheme based on the initial Dosing Model and Final Model are given in Table 14. According to 
the final dosing scheme children with a BSA of 0.4, 0.5, 0.9 and 1.0 m2 would receive a higher dose 
from a PK perspective. 
The following observations were made: 
• 
In  VPCs  using  the  Dosing  Model  (the  initially  developed  modeliii),  Cmax  was  underestimated  and 
median  of  simulated  concentrations  were  not  centered  on  observed  new  data  in  the  largest  BSA 
group; 
• 
In VPCs using the Updated Model, observed concentrations were covered by the predicted region 
but were above the median of simulated concentrations between 2 and 3 hrs in subjects with a BSA 
> 1.0 m2; 
•  0.03% of simulated AUCinf was higher than 3600 μg×h/mL and 0.77% of simulated AUCinf were 
below 760 μg×h/mL; 
•  According to predictions by the Updated Model, from a PK perspective, the updated dosing scheme 
indicated that children with a BSA of 0.4, 0.5, 0.9 and 1.0 m2 should receive a higher dose than 
currently indicated by the study protocol to obtain the target exposure of 1355 μg×h/mL. Deviations 
ranged between 9% for BSA levels 0.6, 0.7 and 0.8 m2, up to 20% for BSA levels 0.4 and 0.5 m2 
and 17% for BSA levels 0.9 and 1.0 m2. 
Based on these observations at this final analysis, an increase of the current dose levels for children with 
a BSA of 0.4, 0.5, 0.9 and 1.0 m2 might be considered from a PK perspective. Paediatric subjects with a 
BSA < 0.4 m2 should receive a daily dose of 10 g/m2 while paediatric subjects with a BSA ≥ 0.4 m2 and 
a BSA < 0.9 m2 should receive a daily dose of 12 g/m2 while children with a BSA ≥ 0.9 m2 should receive 
a daily dose of 14 g/m2.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
TREO  is  considered  a  "prodrug"  of  a  bifunctional  alkylating  cytotoxic  drug.  The  introduction  of  two 
hydroxyl groups in position 2 and 3 of the molecule is responsible for the striking differences between 
TREO  and  BU  with  respect  to  physico-chemical,  pharmacological  and  toxicological  characteristics,  but 
also with respect to the mode of activation and mechanism of alkylation [Brookes 196112; Feit 197036; 
Hartley 199950; Köpf-Maier 1996]. TREO has to be activated by transformation into epoxide species, 
which are considered responsible for alkylation and cross-linking of macromolecules like DNA. Cytotoxic 
effects  are  predominantly,  but  not  exclusively,  affecting  rapidly  proliferating  cells  and  tissues  like 
malignant cells or e.g. normal haematopoietic cells [Feit 1970; Hartley 1999; Munkelt 2008]. 
TREO  presents  end-standing  methanesulfonyloxy  groups  in  the  neighborhood  of  hydroxyl  groups.  In 
consequence,  an  intramolecular  alkylation  and  formation  of  epoxide  rings  occurs.  Afterwards,  these 
epoxides are able to alkylate nucleophilic centers. In contrast, BU directly alkylates nucleophilic centers. 
Under  physiological  conditions  (pH  7.4,  temperature  37°C),  this  intra-  molecular  reaction  occurs 
spontaneously  (non-enzymatically),  converting  the  pharmacologically  inactive  TREO  into  an  active 
monoepoxide intermediate and finally to L-diepoxibutane as shown in Figure 1:  
Figure 1: Non-enzymatic activation pathway of treosulfan [Feit 1970] 
Given the known mechanism of action of treosulfan, it is pharmacologically plausible and expect that it 
can also act as preconditioning agent for non-malignant diseases. Therefore, from a mechanistic point 
of view, the extension of indication can be supported. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Regarding  the  relevant  pharmacodynamic  data  to  support  this  variation,  namely  the  extension  of 
indication to non-malignant disease, it can be considered that the MAH has presented data to support it. 
Sufficient toxicity against haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is a requirement for a conditioning agent. 
Preclinical  in  vitro  and  in vivo  studies  have  clearly  shown  that  TREO  is  evidently  cytotoxic  to  all  HSC 
subsets,  both  primitive  and  committed.  HSC  toxicity  is  most  pronounced  when  TREO  is  given  in 
fractionated doses instead of a single dose administration [Ploemacher 2004; Sjöö 2006; Van Pel 2003, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/117245/2023  
Page 53/183 
 
 
 
 
Westerhof  2000].  A  study  with  non-malignant  HSCs  from  5  healthy  donors  has  shown  that  purified 
CD34+  HSCs  were  most  sensitive  to  TREO,  followed  by  CD56+CD3-  NK  and  CD3+  T  cells  [Munkelt 
2008].   
When used in doses higher than conventional ones, TREO demonstrates also immunosuppressive action, 
e.g. inhibition of T cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis of immunocompetent cells (T cells, B cells, 
NK  cells,  monocytes)  and  reduced  expression  of  proinflammatory  cytokines  [Kopadze  2007;  Munkelt 
2008; Sjöö 2006].  Immunosuppressive properties of TREO are considered to be of great importance 
with regard to its application in a conditioning regimen for alloHSCT. Together with the myeloablative 
activity,  they  contribute  to  the  achievement  of  stable  transplant  engraftment,  complete  donor-type 
chimerism as well as prevention of GvHD. 
Engraftment  of  donor  stem  cells  and  time  to  100%  donor  cell  engraftment  are  parameters  which 
characterise  the  pharmacodynamic  effects  of  TREO-based  conditioning.  Concentration-response 
relationship was investigated within the PopPK study. The AUCs of three patients for which engraftment 
was not established were in the same range as AUCs of subjects for which engraftment was established. 
Since engraftment is reached in nearly all patients, time to 100% donor cell engraftment was considered 
as a better suited parameter to study this concentration-response relationship. However, no correlation 
between AUC and time to engraftment in the investigated range of AUCs was seen. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
All available data on PK of TREO in children of different age groups and adults were used to develop a 
first PopPK model [Kinesis 2011]. PK data from trial MC-FludT.14/L [PK Study Report, 26/03/2012] and 
published  data  in  adults  [Beelen  2005;  Hilger  1998;  Scheulen  2000;  Nemecek  2011]  and  paediatric 
patients  [Beier  2012;  Główka  2008]  were  used.  This  model  revealed  that  conventional  dosing  simply 
based on body surface area (BSA) results in a significantly higher exposure (AUC) of smaller children 
and  infants  with  low  BSA  compared  to  adolescents  or  adults.  Various  paediatric  transplant  working 
groups  published  their  results  of  PK  evaluation  of  TREO  in  children  and  reported  similar  observations 
[Beier 2012; Chiesa 2014; Główka 2015; Koyyalamudi 2016; Ten Brink 2014].  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/117245/2023  
Page 54/183 
 
 
 
 
The  developed  model  consists  of  two  compartments  with  first  order  distribution  and  elimination 
processes. 
The model estimated relation between clearance and BSA suggests that for dosing the following formula 
should be used:  
Dosemodel (g) = Target AUC (µg/mL × h)/1000 × 17.8 × (BSA/1.75)1.29  
No relation between time of engraftment and AUC was observed in the range of 760-3600 µg/mL × h. 
Therefore, considering the variability between subjects, aiming for a dose to reach a target AUC of about 
1300  µg/mL  ×  h  (as  observed  in  adults  after  administration  of  14  g/m²  TREO)  should  be  sufficient. 
Higher dosing would not decrease time to engraftment while there is not enough data to imply that lower 
dosing would not increase time to engraftment. For an AUC of 1300 µg/mL × h, the following dosing 
scheme was presented: 
The initial modelling report [Kinesis 2011] was amended in 2012 [Kinesis 2012]. The MAH aimed for an 
exposure  level  (AUC0-∞)  in  children  comparable  to  that  observed  with  a  dose  of  14  g/m²  in  adult 
patients. Aimed AUC for a dose of 14 g/m² was calculated by ordinary least squares regression analysis, 
including now only adult data for all dose groups. This was done on log transformed data, due to log 
normality of the calculated AUC’s. Based on the regression equation, the calculated geometric mean AUC 
after administration of 14 g/m² was 1355 (90% CI 1308 – 1404) µg/mL × h. This target AUC was chosen 
for the paediatric studies. Conventional dosing (based on g/m² BSA only) results in significantly higher 
exposure for smaller children with lower BSA, while exposure in adolescents/adults is more or less equal. 
In addition, no clear differences in exposure for adults with high BSA (> 2.0 m²) compared to adults 
with lower BSA were observed; however, the available data for adults with BSA > 2.0 m² was relatively 
limited. Table 21 shows a comparison of exposure simulations (n = 200) for  conventional dosing (14 
g/m²) and model-based dosing, aiming for an AUC of 1355 µg/mL × h, indicating the reduced variability 
in Cmax and AUC between BSA levels. 
Based on this PopPK report, a dose recommendation was derived for the paediatric transplant trials MC-
FludT.17/M  and  MC-FludT.16/NM  aiming  a  target  AUC  for  TREO  in  all  paediatric  age  groups  of  1355 
μg/mL × h corresponding to an exposure of 14 g/m² in adult patients [Table 22].

At the end, the following more simplified BSA-adjusted dosing table was used in trials FludT.16/NM (n = 
17) and MC-FludT.17/M [Table 23]. 
Pharmacokinetic  data  for  TREO  and  its  monoepoxide  metabolite  from  two  paediatric  studies  were 
analysed. For this final analysis, data of 24 subjects from study MC-FludT.16/NM and of 59 subjects from 
study MC-FludT.17/M were available. Patient’s ages were less than 1 year (n = 11), 1 to < 2 years (n = 
11), 2 to < 4 years (n = 13), 4 to < 12 years (n = 24), and 12 to < 18 years (n = 24). Patients with a 
body surface area (BSA) ≤ 0.5 m² had received 10 g/m² TREO, > 0.5 to 1.0 m² had received 12 g/m² 
TREO, and patients > 1.0 m² BSA had received 14 g/m² TREO.  Pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis 
were  done  by  Venn  Life  Sciences  ED  BV  [former  name  Kinesis  Pharma  BV]  (Breda,  The  Netherlands) 
using the validated computer program Phoenix™ WinNonlin® (version 6.2.1).  
Non-compartmental analysis model 202 (constant infusion input, plasma data) was applied for the PK 
analysis of TREO, model 200 (extravascular input, plasma data) was applied for monoepoxide. All blood 
samples taken to determine TREO and monoepoxide plasma concentrations were available for the PK 
analysis. Treosulfan and monoepoxide concentrations were reported as ‘corrected’ (corrected for dilution 
and hematocrit). For the PK analysis of TREO and monoepoxide ‘corrected’ concentrations were used. In 
the report, TREO and monoepoxide refer to the ‘corrected’ values. The lower limit of quantification of

TREO  and  monoepoxide  was  500  ng/mL  and  10  ng/mL,  respectively.    The  actual  individual  infusion 
duration ranged between 1.97 h and 2.50 h. Maximum TREO concentrations were reached directly after 
end of the infusion.  
The individual PK profiles were similar in shape and magnitude, independent of age group or BSA group, 
except  for  one  subject  with  a  lower  profile  compared  to  other  subjects  in  the  lower  age/BSA  groups.  
Decline of TREO concentrations after the end of infusion was bi-exponentially. Inter-subject variability 
of  plasma  concentrations  by  time-point  based  on  percent  of  geometric  coefficient  of  variation  ranged 
from 10.2% to 96.4% in the different age and BSA groups.  Maximum plasma concentration of TREO 
ranged between 118 and 2,060 μg/mL and almost all were reached directly after end of infusion. AUC0-
∞ values ranged between 274 and 3,212 µg/mL × h. The AUC0-∞ of one subject (i.e., 274 µg/mL × h) 
was below the range what is considered safe and effective (760 – 3,600 µg/mL × h), for all other subjects 
AUC0-∞ was within this range. No major differences in mean Cmax were observed. Mean AUClast and 
AUC0-∞ values of TREO were comparable for the lower three age groups and appeared slightly higher 
with  increasing  age  group  for  the  two  higher  age  groups.  However,  the  ranges  for  Cmax  and  AUC0-∞ 
were  overlapping  and  therefore  Cmax  and  AUC0-∞  can  be  considered  comparable  for  all  age  groups. 
Mean values of Cl and Vd were comparable between age groups 1 (1 month to < 1 year), 2 (1 to < 2 
years) and 3 (2 to < 4 years) and thereafter increased with increasing age group. Mean apparent terminal 
half-life was comparable between the different age groups and ranged between 1.3 and 1.6 h, due to CL 
and Vd increasing in a similar extent.  
Mean Cmax values were comparable between the different BSA groups.  Mean AUClast and AUC0-∞ values 
of  TREO  were  slightly  higher  with  increasing  BSA  group.  Based  on  mean  values,  AUCs  were 
approximately 20% higher in the BSA group ≥ 1.0 m² compared to the BSA group ≤ 0.5 m². However, 
the  ranges  for  Cmax  and  AUC∞  were  overlapping  and  therefore  Cmax  and  AUC∞  can  be  considered 
comparable  for  all  BSA  groups.  Mean  values of  Cl  and  Vd  were  increased  with  increasing  BSA  group.  
Mean apparent terminal half-life was comparable between the different BSA groups and ranged between 
1.3 and 1.6 h, due to CL and Vd increasing in a similar extent. With respect to the shape of the mean 
plasma concentration-time profiles of the monoepoxide, no major differences were observed between 
the age groups or BSA groups, except for the lowest age and BSA group where a large variability in the 
peak concentrations was observed. Maximum monoepoxide concentrations were reached directly after 
end of the infusion. The individual PK profiles were similar in shape and magnitude, independent of age 
group or BSA group, except for two subjects in the lower age/BSA groups and one subject in the 2 to 
<4  years  and  >0.5  to  ≤  1.0  m²  group.  No  major  differences  in  Cmax,  AUClast  and  AUC0-∞  of 
monoepoxide were observed between the different age and BSA groups. Mean apparent terminal half-
life is comparable between the different age groups and ranged between 1.3 and 1.7 h.  
The PopPK model was updated in 2018 with the inclusion of new PK data from studies MCFludT.16/NM 
(n  =  21)  and  MC-FludT.17/M  (n  =  59)  [Kinesis  2018].  Since  no  relation  between  AUC  and  time  to 
engraftment was previously observed in the AUC range of 760-3600 μg/mL × h, an AUC value in this 
exposure interval was considered as safe and effective. In a first step, prediction of the dosing model 
was evaluated by means of dose normalized visual predictive checks (VPCs) and distributions of AUClast. 
The VPCs predicted historical concentrations adequately for all three BSA groups. The updated PopPK 
model is a two-compartment model with linear elimination and intercompartmental clearance. After IV 
administration into the central compartment (V1), TREO is distributed into the peripheral compartment 
(V2) and eliminated. Both processes have linear kinetics determined by intercompartmental clearance 
(Q) and clearance (CL). The model described an effect of BSA on CL, V1, V2 and Q. 
The following observations were made: – In VPCs using the initially developed dosing model, Cmax was 
underestimated and median of simulated concentrations were not centered on observed new data in the 
largest BSA group. – In VPCs using the updated model, observed concentrations were covered by the 
Assessment report

predicted  region  but  were  above  the  median  of  simulated  concentrations  in the  largest  BSA  group.  – 
0.03% of simulated AUC0-∞ was higher than 3600 μg/mL × h and less or equal than 1.13% of simulated 
AUC0-∞  were  below  760  μg/mL  ×  h.  –  According  to  predictions  by  the  updated  model,  from  a  PK 
perspective, the updated dosing scheme indicated that children with a BSA of 0.4, 0.5, 0.9 and 1.0 m² 
would receive a higher dose than currently indicated by the study protocol to obtain the target exposure 
of 1355 μg/mL × h. Deviations ranged between 9% for BSA levels 0.6, 0.7 and 0.8 m², up to 20% for 
BSA levels 0.4 and 0.5 m² and 17% for BSA levels 0.9 and 1.0 m². This new BSA-adapted dosing regimen 
was implemented in the ongoing trial MC-FludT.16/NM (protocol version 5.1, dated 15-May-2019). Since 
then up to the end of recruitment the following schedule was used. 
The final PopPK model was reported to medac in 2020 [Venn Life Sciences 2020].  
Distributions of predicted AUC0-∞ displayed by BSA groups are shown in Figure 12. For all BSA groups, 
0.77% of simulated AUC0-∞  are below 760 and 0.03% above 3,600 μg/mL × h. 
Based on these observations at this final analysis, an increase of the current dose levels for children with 
a BSA of 0.4, 0.5, 0.9 and 1.0 m² might be considered from a PK perspective [Table 24]. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
 Pharmacokinetics 
An initial PopPK model was develop by the MAH in order to predict the PK of Treosulfan in children. This 
model was based on published data, and studies MC-FludT.16/NM and MC-FludT.17/M were undertaken 
after a PIP, in order to validate the initial PopPK model but only included a partial subset of subjects for 
whom  data  was  available.  This  interim  PopPK  model  was  evaluated  at  the  initial  submission  and  the 
company is now submitting the updated one with the full data available. In practice, no major changes 
are expected as the number of included subjects is only slightly increased from the 2017 PopPK model 
with  the  inclusion  of  new  PK  data  from  study  MCFludT.16/NM  (n  =  24  an  increase  in  7  subjects).  In 
general, the procedure for data management, covariates considered, and data removal is the same as 
previously undertaken by the MAH. Out of the 2505 data records, 139 data records (5,5%) were flagged 
and excluded. Of these 139 data records, 111 occurred at exactly the same time as a dosing event, 8 
showed  a  positive  concentration  before  the  first  dosing  was  applied  and  20  (0.8%)  records  showed 
suspicious behaviour as observed in exploratory data analysis prior to modelling. These are acceptable. 
The nonlinear mixed effects modelling approach as implemented in NONMEM version 7.1.0 was used for 
model estimation, with first-order conditional estimation method with interaction (FOCEI). The previous 
developed model was used as starting model and a final covariate model was then developed by forward-
backward analysis. The descriptive and predictive performance of the developed population PK model 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/117245/2023  
Page 58/183 
 
 
 
was  investigated  using  commonly  used  methods.  Overall,  the  modelling  strategy  is  considered 
acceptable. 
The starting model, updated with the new available data, consisted in a 2-compartmental mammillary 
model with first order distribution and elimination processes with BSA as a covariate associated to all 
the model parameters. This model was considered sufficient to explain the data, as the introduction of 
a maturation function did not result in a significant improvement of the model fitting characteristics.  
The  introduction  of  covariates  by  forward-backward  selection  resulted  in  the  inclusion  of  the  CCG 
(creatinine clearance or glomerular filtration rate) in the CL parameter. The MAH considered that this 
inclusion was not supported due to a low precision of the estimated parameter, with an RSM = 33%.  
Based on the provided model, CL of Treosulfan was found to be 17.7 L/h at the recommended 14 g/m2 
dose and the volume of distribution (sum of V1 and V2) was 39.2 L for a subject with a BSA of 1.75 m2. 
These values are basically similar to the ones previously determined with a reduced data. 
Goodness-of-Fit plots revealed no model bias based on the pooled data. ETA shrinkage (shη) of V1, V2 
and Q were high (between 27 and 44%). This is not much problematic due to the covariate selection 
process that was independent of the EBE of the model. 
Based on the VPC, prediction of the Final Model improved compared to the prediction of the initial model 
but the prediction of observed concentrations in subjects with BSA larger than 1 m2 (BSAgrp = 3) is still 
biased.  This  should  be  further  explored  and  the  reason  for  the  under  prediction  of  the  initial 
concentrations  for  the  BSAgrp  3  properly  discussed.  Also,  the  VPC  of  the  two  studies  and  by  BSAgrp 
should  be  provided  showing  also  the  median,  5th  &  95th  confidence  intervals  of  the  observed  and 
simulated  data  for  better  assessment  of  the  model  according  to  Bergstrand  et  al  2011  (Prediction-
corrected visual predictive checks for diagnosing nonlinear mixed-effects models). VPCs stratified on age 
groups are considered relevant given the submission and should, therefore, be presented. Finally, the 
estimated exponents of the BSA covariate (1.17 for V1, 1.19 for CL, 1.82 for V2 and 1.57 for Q) indicate 
that  the  central  compartment  scales  almost  proportionally  with  BSA,  however  for  the  peripheral 
compartment, the effects are stronger and scale more than proportionally with BSA. The MAH evaluated 
whether bodyweight-based scaling (with conventional exponents of 0.75 for CL and Q, and 1.0 for V1 
and V2) as compared to BSA-based scaling is not a better alternative to describe the pharmacokinetics 
of treosulfan.   
Simulations under the final model and for the current drug administration regime for the 3 BSA groups 
showed that 0.77% of simulated AUCinf are below 760 and 0.03% above 3600 μg×h/mL. This indicates 
that the current regime is resulting in AUC inside the target interval of 760 – 3600 ugxh/mL and since 
the defined dosing criteria were considered fulfilled, the original dosing schedule was to be kept. The 
MAH  was  asked  to  justify  why  a  new  dosing  schedule  is  still  proposed.  Regarding  the  new  proposed 
dosing schedule, the MAH provided simulations on the resulting AUCs for the newly proposed BSAgrp 
dosing with particular relevance for the newly proposed children with a BSA of 0.4, 0.5, 0.9 and 1.0 m2 
that  would  receive  a  higher  dose  from  a  PK  perspective.  The  detailed  description  of  the  maturation 
function explored during the PopPK model development and discussion of its non-inclusion in the final 
model was requested to the MAH. 
After receiving responses to the issues raised above two other concerns remained to be solved. These 
were related with: a) the newly proposed regime and the potential risk of increased safety issues; and 
b) the fact that subsequent to observations of some cases of secondary graft failure in the Treosulfan 
arm during the MC-FludT.16/NM study some patients received higher doses than the ones in the new 
proposed dosage regimen. With the responses to the second RSI, the MAH provided sufficient information 
that indicate that the proposed final BSA-categories for dose calculation seem adequate. In addition, the 
MAH included in section 5.1 of the SmPC, as requested, information related with the two subjects that 
Assessment report

in  MCFludT.16/NM  trial  were  effectively  dosed  with higher  doses  that  the original  posology  proposed.  
Overall, all the issues raised in the assessment were resolved. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Given the known mechanism of action of treosulfan, it is pharmacologically plausible and expected that 
it can also act as preconditioning agent for non-malignant diseases. Therefore, from a mechanistic point 
of view, the extension of indication can be supported. 
Given the absence of a clear relationship of the AUC of treosulfan with the primary endpoint chosen, no 
direct relation can be performed regarding a PK/PD relationship. Further support to this indication should 
be performed with efficacy rather than PD data. 
The proposed TREO dose regimen for adult patients is 10 g/m²/d, given on three consecutive days from 
Day  -4  to  -2  before  HSCT.  All  268  patients  treated  with  this  regimen  within  the  pivotal  study  MC-
FludT.14/L  Trial  II  achieved  engraftment  of  donor  HSCTs.  Only  one  patient  in  the  TREO  group 
experienced  a  primary  graft  failure.  Complete  donor-type  chimerism  at  Day  +  28  was  achieved  in  a 
similar proportion of patients compared to the higher dose regimen used in MC-FludT.14/L Trial I. The 
duration of neutropenia was reduced with the modified regimen compared to the formerly used TREO 
regimen of 14 g/m²/d × 3 (Day -6 to -4) used in study MC-FludT.14/L Trial I (14.0 vs. 17.5 days). As a 
result of this regimen change, the incidence of infections (27.0% vs. 43.5%; TREO-related: 8.1% vs. 
11.9%) and infection-related death (9.3% vs. 16.1%) could be significantly reduced. Additionally, event-
free (EFS) and overall survival (OS) at 24 months increased significantly (EFS: 65.7% vs. 51.2%; OS: 
72.7% vs. 60.2%).   
Paediatric patients are usually treated with MAC instead of RIC regimens to avoid graft failure or disease 
relapse  [Algeri  20211;  Ali  20202,  Lum  2019].  This  is  justified  because  children  usually  do  not  have 
comorbidities  and  tolerate  higher  doses  of  chemotherapy.  Therefore,  the  paediatric  dose  regimen 
includes  a  TREO  dose  that  corresponds  to  a  14  g/m²  exposure  in  adult  patients  and  most  patients 
additionally received thiotepa. Results of the two paediatric studies support this strategy as OS is much 
better and non-relapse mortality (NRM) lower compared to the two studies 14/L in adults. Based on the 
resulting PopPK model the MAH recommended a BSA-dependent dose calculation for children. However, 
based on the data obtained from this PopPK model the proposed slightly modified dosing regimen needs 
to be further justified as outlined above. 
After receiving responses to the request for supplementary information raised above two other concerns 
remained  to  be  solved.  These  were  related  with  the  newly  proposed  regime  and  the  potential  risk  of 
increased safety issues. In addition, the fact that subsequent to observations of some cases of secondary 
graft failure in the Treosulfan arm during the MC-FludT.16/NM study some patients with BSA from >0.3 
to <0.4 m2 and from > 0.8 to < 0.9 m2 received higher doses than the ones in the new proposed dosage 
regimen,  was  considered  that  should  be  reflected  in  section  5.1  of  the  SmPC  (with  indication  of  the 
number of patients involved).  
With the responses to the second request for supplementary information the MAH provided sufficient 
arguments to support that an increased safety risk by application of the proposed final BSA categories 
for dose calculation of treosulfan is not expected despite the absence of historical values of treosulfan 
with AUCinf>3600 mg.h/L observed in the paediatric trials MC-FludT.16NM and MC-FludT.17/M, that 
prevents the establishment of a correlation between AUCinf and the number of related adverse events. 
This conclusion is instead supported by historical values of Treosulfan AUC as high as 6302 mg.h/L in 
adult patients which were considered safe. In this line of reasoning, the higher simulated values for the 
critical BSA levels are well below this value. Taking this in consideration, as well as the increased risk 
of secondary graft failures after treosulfan-based conditioning, the proposed final BSA-categories for

dose calculation seem adequate. In addition, the MAH also clarified that after the protocol amendment, 
two subjects were effectively dosed with higher doses that the original posology proposed. These 
presented a BSA value of 0.5 m2 and 0.9 m2 having received 12 g/m2/day and 14 g/m2/day. These 
values would be the same under the final proposed regime. Both patients did not experience graft 
failure and survived while censored at day 366. This information will be included in section 5.1 of the 
SmPC. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology documentation is in overall sufficient to support the proposed changes. The 
MAH  provided  additional  information  that  indicate  that  the  proposed  final  BSA-categories  for  dose 
calculation  seem  adequate.  In  addition,  the  MAH  included  in  section  5.1  of  the  SmPC,  as  requested, 
information related with the two subjects that in MCFludT.16/NM trial were effectively dosed with higher 
doses that the original posology proposed.   
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
Seven studies (5 in adult patients and 2 in paediatric patients) were performed by the MAH which provide 
important information on the efficacy of TREO as part of a conditioning regimen before alloHSCT: 
•  One dose-response study (MC-FludT.6/L) 
•  Two  non-randomised  phase  II  studies  in  two  specific  haematological  malignancies  (MC-
FludT.7/AML; MC-FludT.8/MDS), and  
•  Two  randomised,  active-controlled  trials  (MC-FludT.14/L  Trial  I  and  Trial  II),  all  using  a 
conditioning  regimen  consisting  of  treosulfan  (TREO)  plus  fludarabine  (FLU)  in  adult  patients 
have been performed by the MAH.  
•  One  completed  non-controlled  trial  (MC-FludT.17/M)  with  TREO-based  conditioning  in 
paediatric patients with haematological malignancies (incl. ALL, AML, MDS and JMML).  
•  One  completed  randomised  active-controlled  trial  in  paediatric  patients  with  non-malignant 
diseases (MC-FludT.16/NM) has also been.  
A  deferral  for  these  two  last  studies  had  been  granted  by  the  Paediatric  Committee  of  the  EMA  (see 
Paediatric  Investigation  Plan  [PIP]).  According  to  the  PIP,  one  meta-analysis  of  engraftment  data 
[Baumgart 2017] and an EBMT registry study [Peters 2011] on the use of TREO-based conditioning in 
paediatric patients with malignant and non-malignant diseases were performed and integrated into the 
data package. 
Additionally, another EBMT registry study [Peters 2017] on the use of TREO- or BU-based conditioning 
in paediatric patients with non-malignant diseases was performed and is part of the documentation. 
2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
 MC-FludT.6/L 
This international, non-controlled, multicentre dose-response phase II study investigated a conditioning 
regimen of TREO in combination with FLU. Patients with a haematological chemosensitive malignancy 
indicated for alloHSCT (CML, NHL, CLL, HL, MM, AML, ALL, MDS), but presenting an increased toxicity

risk  for  classical  (high-dose  busulfan  [BU]  or  standard-dose  total  body  irradiation  [TBI])  conditioning 
therapies were recruited into this trial. Age > 50 years (51%), previous high-dose chemotherapy and 
autologous HSCT (38%), previous infectious complications (29%) and previous intensive chemotherapy 
(20%) were the most frequent risk categories, homogeneously distributed between the different dose 
groups. Stem cell donors were either HLA-identical siblings (MRD) or HLA-identical unrelated (MUD) or 
one mismatch (out of the 6 standard markers) siblings (1 misMRD). This study was initiated at seven 
study centres in Germany, Finland, Poland and Sweden. 
2.4.2.  Main studies 
  MC-FludT.16/NM 
Title of Study 
Clinical Phase II trial to compare treosulfan-based conditioning therapy with busulfan-based conditioning 
prior  to  allogeneic  haematopoietic  stem  cell  transplantation  (HSCT)  in  paediatric  patients  with  non-
malignant diseases.

administered  as  part  of  a  standardised  FLU-containing  conditioning  regimen  and  to  contribute  to  a 
pharmacokinetic model. 
Primary Objective 
The  primary  objective  of  this  trial  was  the  comparative  evaluation  of  freedom  from  transplantation 
(treatment)-related mortality, defined as death from any transplantation (treatment)-related cause from 
start of conditioning treatment (visit Day - 7) until day +100 after HSCT. 
This multicentre study was conducted in Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic and Italy.

day +100) and chronic GvHD (cGvHD) (until 12 months after HSCT). 
8. Comparative evaluation of use of rescue therapies including donor-lymphocyte infusions (DLIs), stem 
cell infusions with or without further conditioning regimens, re-occurrence of transfusion dependence 
(ie, necessity of regular transfusions of red blood cells or PLTs. 
9. Evaluation of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of treosulfan and its epoxides and to develop a PK 
model for assessing relevant covariates. 
10.  Comparative  evaluation  of  secondary  graft  failure,  cGvHD,  donor-type  chimerism,  OS  and 
transplantation-related mortality (TRM) during the longer-term follow-up phase. 
Methodology 
Prospective, randomised (1:1), open-label, multicentre, active-controlled, parallel-group Phase 2 clinical 
trial  to  describe  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  intravenous  (i.v.)  treosulfan  compared  to  the  conventional 
(myeloablative) dose of i.v. busulfan, each administered as part of a standardised fludarabine-containing 
conditioning regimen, and to contribute to a PK model. 
Subjects were randomised to receive conditioning treatment with treosulfan on day -6, -5, and -4 (body 
surface area [BSA] adapted dosing), or busulfan on day -7, -6, -5, and -4 (actual body weight adapted 
dosing)  followed  by  allogeneic  HSCT  on  day  0.  Randomisation  was  stratified  by  2  pre-specified 
background conditioning regimens: 
• Stratum A: conditioning therapy with additional thiotepa. 
• Stratum B: conditioning therapy without additional thiotepa. 
The trial duration per subject consisted of 4 phases: 
•  Treatment  phase:  7  days  with  either  3  days  of  treosulfan  administration  or  4  days  of  busulfan 
administration (completed) 
• Observation phase: until day +100 after HSCT (according to the PIP, this is defined until at least visit 
Day +100 [inclusive] of HSCT procedure) (completed) 
• Follow-up phase: until 12 months after HSCT (completed) 
• Longer-term follow-up phase (after completion of PIP): a minimum of 3 years of HSCT (ongoing). 
The current clinical trial report (CTR) focusses mainly on the complete and final 12-month data, but also 
contains longer-term follow-up data that were available by data cut-off on 07-Jun-2021. Longer-term 
follow-up  data  will  be  collected  until  the  last  recruited  subject  has  completed  visit  Month  36  and 
presented in an updated version of the CTR expected in 2023. 
Test product, Dose, Mode of Administration: 
Assessment report

Intravenous treosulfan 1 g or 5 g: 10 or 12 or 14 g/m²/day (BSA-adapted) on day -6 to day -4 before 
HSCT 
Busulfan 60 mg: 3.2 to 4.8 mg/kg/day (actual body weight adapted) on day -7 to day -4 before HSCT 
Duration of Treatment:  
Subjects within the test arm received treosulfan on 3 consecutive days (day -6 to day -4), while subjects 
in the reference arm received busulfan on 4 consecutive days (day -7 to day -4). 
Subjects within both treatment arms received i.v. fludarabine (30 mg/m²/d) on 5 consecutive days (day 
-7 to -3) as mandatory non-investigational product. On Investigator’s discretion, subjects could receive 
i.v. thiotepa in 2 single doses of 5 mg/kg given on day -2. 
Allogeneic HSCT was performed on day 0. 
Criteria for Evaluation: 
Efficacy: 
Freedom from transplantation (treatment)-related mortality: Freedom from transplantation (treatment)-
related mortality was the primary endpoint of the trial and defined as death from any transplantation 
(treatment)-related  cause  from  start  of  conditioning  treatment  (ie,  visit  Day -7)  until day  +100  after 
HSCT.  The  associated  time  span  of  TRM  (see  endpoint  TRM)  was  defined  as  the  interval  from  end  of 
HSCT to death due to transplantation-related cause whereas the time span of treatment related mortality 
was defined as interval from start of conditioning treatment, ie, visit Day -7, until end of HSCT. 
Transplantation-related mortality: TRM was defined as the probability of dying from GvHD, interstitial 
pneumonitis,  pulmonary  toxicity,  infection  (bacterial,  viral,  fungal,  parasitic,  unknown),  Epstein  Barr 
Virus (EBV) proliferative disease, rejection / poor graft function, HSOS, haemorrhage, cardiac toxicity, 
central  nervous  system  toxicity,  gastrointestinal  toxicity,  skin  toxicity,  renal  failure,  multiple  organ 
failure,  other  HSCT-related  cause.  The  associated  time  span  was  defined  as  the  interval  from  end  of 
HSCT to death due to transplantation-related cause. TRM was evaluated from the end of HSCT until the 
end of the longer-term follow-up phase. 
Overall  survival:  Overall  survival  (OS)  was  defined  as  the  probability  of  surviving.  Survival  time  was 
defined as the time length between end of HSCT and the day of death due to any cause. OS was evaluated 
from the end of HSCT until the end of the longer-term follow-up phase. 
Graft failure: The incidence of graft failure was defined as the probability of having a graft failure (primary 
or secondary) and being alive without using “stem cell infusion (re-transplant) with conditioning” rescue 
therapy (ie, second allogenic transplantations) between the end of HSCT and the end of the longer-term 
follow-up phase. In addition, the rate of primary and secondary graft failures was assessed. 
Engraftment: Neutrophilic granulocytes engraftment was defined as the first of 3 consecutive days with 
an granulocyte count > 0.5 x 109/L in PB, leucocyte engraftment was defined as the first of 3 consecutive 
days  with  a  total  leucocyte  count  >  1  x  109/L  in  PB,  PLT  engraftment  was  defined  as  the  first  of  3 
consecutive  days  with  a)  PLTs  >  20  x  109/L  or  b)  PLTs  >  50  x  109/L  in  PB  in  the  absence  of  PLT 
transfusion.  Time to  engraftment  was  defined  as  the  time  span  between  end of  HSCT  and  neutrophil 
granulocyte  /  leucocyte  /  PLT  engraftment.  In  addition,  the  duration  of  neutropenia  (neutrophilic 
granulocytes ≤ 0.5 x 109/L) and leukopenia (leucocytes granulocytes ≤ 1.0 x 109/L) was analysed based 
on documented laboratory values. 
Quantification of donor type chimerism: Complete donor-type chimerism was defined if a value of ≥ 95% 
donor-type was detected. Mixed chimerism was defined as having a recipient fraction > 5% (to 94%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/117245/2023  
Page 64/183 
 
 
 
Incidences of complete donor-type chimerism were estimated as the number of subjects with complete 
chimerism divided by the total number of subjects at risk. To investigate the mixed donor-type chimerism 
the frequency of subjects with at least 20% or 50% donor-type chimerism was calculated. Chimerism 
was evaluated on visit Day +28, +100 and Month 12, and during longer-term follow-up. 
Event-free survival: Event-free survival (EFS) was defined as the time length between end of HSCT and 
the  date  of  graft  failure  or  “stem  cell  infusion  (re-transplant)  with  conditioning”  rescue  therapy  (ie, 
second allogenic transplantations) or death (whatever occurred first). EFS was evaluated from the end 
of HSCT until the end of the longer-term follow-up phase. 
GvHD-free survival: GvHD-free survival was measured from end of HSCT to time of event. The associated 
time span was defined as the interval from end of HSCT to aGvHD of at least grade III, moderate or 
severe cGvHD, or death (whatever occurred first). GvHD-free survival was evaluated from the end of 
HSCT until the end of the longer-term follow-up phase.  
Chronic GvHD-free survival: cGvHD-free survival was measured from end of HSCT to time of event. The 
associated time span was  defined as the interval from end of  HSCT to moderate or severe cGvHD or 
death (whatever occurred first). cGvHD-free survival was evaluated from the end of HSCT until the end 
of the longer-term follow-up phase. 
Rescue therapies: The use of and duration of using rescue therapies like DLIs, stem cell boost, stem cell 
infusion  (retransplantation)  with  conditioning,  stem  cell  infusion  (re-transplantation)  without 
conditioning,  transfusion  dependence  for  red  blood  cells,  transfusion  dependence  for  PLTs,  and  other 
was described from end of HSCT until the end of the longer-term follow-up phase. 
Pharmacokinetics:  
Pharmacokinetic (PK) data were collected to contribute to a population model and to assess covariates. 
On day -6, blood samples were collected from a subset of subjects allocated to treosulfan treatment. 
Bioanalytical methods applied and results of PK and population pharmacokinetic analysis are reported 
by Celerion and Venn Life Science.

Results 
The CSR of study MC-FludT.16/NM focusses on completed 12 month follow-up data for all subjects, but 
also contains follow-up data available as of the data cut-off on 07-Jun-2021. Longer-term follow-up data 
will be collected until the last recruited subject has completed visit Month 36 and presented in an updated 
version  of  the  CSR  expected  in  2023.  The  study  is  based  on  an  approved  PIP,  incl.  four  agreed 
modifications. 
The results of the primary endpoint were: In the Full analysis set (FAS), the proportion of subjects which 
had died from transplantation- or treatment-related cause until day +100 was higher in the busulfan 
arm  (5  of  50  subjects;  10.0%)  than  the  treosulfan  arm  (0  of  51  subjects,  0.0%).  The  incidence  of 
freedom from transplantation (treatment)-related mortality until day +100 was 90.0% (90% CI: 80.1%, 
96.0%) in the busulfan arm and 100.0% (90% CI: 94.3%, 100.0%) in the treosulfan arm (p=0.0528), 
thus in favour of treosulfan.  
Results from exploratory subgroup analyses (incidences of transplantation (treatment)-related mortality 
until day +100 by disease, donor type, thiotepa, serotherapy, CTP age group, and ICH age group) are 
presented. The forest plot for transplantation (treatment)-related mortality until day +100 by subgroups 
is  given  in  Figure  11.4.1.1.A.  The  results  of  the  subgroup  analyses  were  consistent  with  the  main 
analysis.

The key results of the exploratory analysis of the secondary endpoints were: 
•  TRM at visit Month 12 was 12.0% (90% CI: 6.3%, 22.1%) in the busulfan arm and 3.9% (90% CI: 
1.2%, 12.0%) in the treosulfan arm (HR 0.29, 90% CI: 0.08, 1.09; p=0.1244), thus in favour of 
treosulfan.

In the 14 g/m²/day dose group, 2 of 10 subjects (20%) died from transplantation–related cause; no 
event (0.0%) occurred in the 2 lower dose groups. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of TRM at 12 months was 
20.0% (90% CI: 6.7%, 51.1%) in the 14 g/m²/day dose group and 0% (90% CI: 0.0%, 0.0%) in the 
other  dose  groups.  This  apparent  dose-dependency  has  to  be  seen  in  the  context  of  PK  data,  which 
showed  a  comparable  drug  exposure  for  all  3  dose  groups.  Thus,  other  prognostic  factors  (like  age, 
disease, donor type) have to be taken into account when interpreting the observed effect between dose 
groups. 
•  OS at visit Month 12 was 88.0% (90% CI: 77.9%, 93.7%) in the busulfan arm and 96.1% (90% 
CI: 88.0%, 98.8%) in the treosulfan arm (HR 0.29, 90%CI: 0.08, 1.09, p=0.1244), thus in favour 
of treosulfan.

In the 14 g/m²/day dose group, 2 of 10 subjects (20%) died; no event occurred in the 2 lower dose 
groups. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of OS at 12 months was 80.0% (90% CI: 48.9%, 93.3%) in the 14 
g/m²/day dose group, and 100% (90% CI: 100.0%, 100.0%) in the other dose groups. This apparent 
dose-dependency has to be seen in the context of PK data, which showed a comparable drug-exposure 
for all 3 dose groups. Thus, other prognostic factors (like age, disease, or donor type) have to be taken 
into account when interpreting the observed difference between dose groups. 
•  The rate of graft failures at visit Month 12 was 4.0% (90% CI: 0.0%, 8.6%) in the busulfan arm and 
15.8% (90% CI: 7.4%, 24.3%) in the treosulfan arm (HR 5.48, 90% CI: 1.44, 20.91, p=0.0366), 
thus statistically significant in favour of busulfan. Primary and secondary graft failures were evaluated 
as secondary endpoints.

consistent with the main analysis. All graft failures reported for subjects treated with treosulfan were in 
the subgroup of MUD, and 9 out of 11 subjects (81.8%) with graft failure received serotherapy. 
The cumulative incidences of graft failure at 12 months were 22.2% (90% CI: 0.0%, 45.0%) in the 10 
g/m²/day dose group, 19.1% (90% CI: 7.5%, 30.7%) in the 12 g/m²/day dose group, and 0.0% (90% 
CI: 0.0%, 0.0%) in the 14 g/m²/day dose group. This apparent dose-dependency has to be seen in the 
context  of  PK  data,  which  showed  a  comparable  drug-exposure  for  all  3  dose  groups.  Thus,  other 
prognostic factors (like age, disease, or donor type) have to be taken into account when interpreting the 
observed difference between dose groups. 
•  Reconstitution  of  granulopoiesis,  leukopoiesis,  and  thrombopoiesis  was  similar  in  the  treatment 
arms. However, the median duration of CTCAE grade IV neutropenia was statistically significantly 
longer in the treosulfan arm than the busulfan arm (20.0 days compared to 14.5 days, p=0.0108). 
Similar results were seen for duration of CTCAE grade IV leukopenia (19.0 days in the treosulfan 
arm compared to 14.5 days in the busulfan arm, p=0.0087).  
Results  from  exploratory  subgroup  analyses  (conditional  cumulative  incidences  of  reconstitution  of 
thrombopoiesis > 50 x109/L by disease, donor type, thiotepa, serotherapy, CTP age group, and ICH age 
group) are presented. Subgroup analyses were generally consistent with the main analysis. 
•  The fraction of subjects with complete donor type chimerism decreased between visit Day +28 and 
visit Month 12 in both treatment arms, however, the incidence of complete donor-type chimerism 
was  comparable  between  the  treatment  arms  (visit  Day  +100:  p=0.1196;  visit  Month  12: 
p=0.2445). The fraction of subjects with mixed donor type chimerism ≥ 20% and ≥ 50% decreased 
between  visit  Day  +28  and  visit  Month  12  in  the  treosulfan  arm  whereas  it  remained  nearly

unchanged in the busulfan arm. However, the incidences of mixed donor-type chimerism ≥ 20% 
and ≥ 50% were comparable between the treatment arms, apart from  visit Month 12, when the 
incidence of mixed donor type chimerism ≥ 50% was statistically significantly higher in the busulfan 
arm (p=0.0189).  
•  EFS at visit Month 12 was 86.0% (90% CI: 75.5%, 92.2%) in the busulfan arm and 80.3% (90% 
CI: 69.2%, 87.8%) in the treosulfan arm (p=0.3343), thus in favour of busulfan. As graft failure is 
included in the event definition, the lower EFS observed in the treosulfan arm reflects the higher 
rate of secondary graft failures in the treosulfan arm, while death was more frequently reported in 
the busulfan arm.

Title of Study 
Clinical  phase  II  trial  to  describe  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  TREO-based  conditioning  therapy  prior  to 
allogeneic  haematopoietic  stem  cell  transplantation  in  paediatric  patients  with  haematological 
malignancies 
Methods 
The  overall  objective  of  this  Phase  2  trial  was  to  describe  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  i.v.  Treosulfan 
administered  as  part  of  a  standardised  Fludarabine  containing  conditioning  and  to  contribute  to  a  PK 
model  which  permits  to  extend  the  use  of  Treosulfan  in  the  paediatric  population  by  extrapolating 
efficacy. 
Primary Objective 
The  primary  objective  of  this  trial  was  to  estimate  the  freedom  from  transplant  (treatment)-related 
mortality until 100 days after HSCT. 
The patient recruitment in this study was successfully completed within the planned recruitment period 
until end of September 2016. In total, 18 of the 24 centres initiated have enrolled 70 patients.  
The trial was conducted in centres for stem cell transplantations in 5 countries: 10 sites in Germany, 4 
sites in Poland, 1 site in the UK, 2 sites in Italy, and 1 site in the Czech Republic. 
Secondary Objectives 
1.  Evaluation  of  engraftment  after  HSCT,  defined  as  the  first  of  3  consecutive  days  for  each  of  the 
following 4 criteria: 
•  A leucocyte count of > 1 x 109/L 
•  An absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of > 0.5 x 109/L 
•  A platelet count of ≥ 20 x 109/L in the absence of platelet transfusion 
•  A platelet count of ≥ 50 x 109/L in the absence of platelet transfusion 
2. Evaluation of safety including early toxicity based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE, version 4.03) until day +100 after HSCT, serious adverse reactions (SARs) until the 
end of the longer-term follow-up phase 
3.  Evaluation  of  hepatic  sinusoidal  obstruction  syndrome  (HSOS,  according  to Jones  et  al  [23]),  lung 
toxicity  (CTCAE  term  “Pulmonary  Fibrosis”),  hepatic  toxicity  (according  to  Bearman  [6]),  and 
infections of any CTCAE grade (non-serious and serious) until day +100 
4. Evaluation of donor-type chimerism on day +28, day +100, and 12 months after HSCT 
5.  Evaluation  of  non-relapse  mortality  (NRM),  transplant-related  mortality  (TRM),  graft  failure  rate, 
incidence of relapse / progression, relapse-free survival (RFS) / progression free survival (PFS), and 
overall survival (OS) until 12 months after HSCT 
6. Evaluation of incidence and severity of aGvHD (until day +100) and cGvHD (until 12 months after 
HSCT) 
7.  Evaluation  of  use  of  rescue  therapies  including  donor-lymphocyte  infusions  (DLIs)  and  further 
conditioning regimens

8. Evaluation of PK parameters of Treosulfan and its epoxides and to develop a PK model for assessing 
relevant covariates 
9. Evaluation of NRM, TRM, secondary graft failures, relapse / progression, RFS / PFS, OS, and GvHD 
during the longer-term follow-up phase 
Methodology 
Prospective, single arm, open-label, multicentre, non-controlled, Phase 2 clinical trial with trial duration 
per subject consisting of 4 phases: 
•  Treatment phase: 7 days with 3 days of Treosulfan administration 
•  Observation phase: until day +100 after HSCT (according to the PIP, this is defined until at least 
visit Day +100 [inclusive] of HSCT procedure) 
•  Follow-up phase: until 12 months after HSCT 
• 
Longer-term follow-up phase (after completion of PIP): a minimum of 3 years after HSCT 
Treatments Administered 
The required total dose of Treosulfan was calculated on the basis of the subject’s BSA.  In a retrospective 
meta-analysis of the EBMT, data of 521 allogeneic and 83 autologous transplanted paediatric subjects 
were evaluated. Subjects received 3 doses of Treosulfan. The administered total dose ranged from 30 
g/m2 to 42 g/m2. Efficacy and safety analysis revealed that the conditioning treatment using Treosulfan 
was tolerable and effective in children of all age groups. 
A PK analysis was conducted with all available data on any paediatric use of Treosulfan and a population 
PK model was developed using data of 23 children and 93 adults. A BSA dependant, tabulated model-
based  dose  recommendation  was  derived  aimed  at a  Treosulfan  area under  the  curve  (AUC)  of  1355 
μg/h*ml, corresponding to an exposure of 3 x 14 g/m2 in adult subjects. 
Within this clinical trial, paediatric subjects were treated with Treosulfan according to the simplified BSA-
adjusted dosing table. This was implemented to avoid substantial over-exposure of the smallest infants 
(with BSA 0.3 to 0.5 m2) and accounted for biological differences in the diverse paediatric age (BSA) 
groups. 
In general, the administered dose of Treosulfan was not to be differed by > 10% from the calculated 
dose.  
Treosulfan  intravenous  (i.v.):  At  dose  levels  10  g/m²,  12  g/m²,  and  14  g/m²  over  2  hours  on  3 
consecutive days on visit Days -6, -5, and -4 before alloHSCT.  
This trial allowed administration of 2 different background conditioning regimens with Treosulfan for the 
treatment  of  ALL,  AML,  MDS,  and  JMML:  one  background  conditioning  regimen  consisted  of  a 
standardised Fludarabine-containing regimen (regimen A) whereas the other consisted of an intensified

regimen with Fludarabine and Thiotepa (regimen B). The Investigator decided for each individual subject 
whether to treat the subject with regimen A or with regimen B.  
• 
Fludarabine i.v. as single doses of 30 mg/m2 on 5 consecutive days (from visit Day -7 to -3). 
•  Subjects may receive Thiotepa i.v. in 2 single doses of 5 mg/kg given on visit Day -2 given at 
the discretion of the investigator 
All subjects with ALL (38.6%), AML (41.4%), MDS (14.3%), or JMML (5.7%) received Treosulfan i.v. at 
a  dose  of  10  g/m2/day  (8.6%),  12  g/m2/day  (37.1%),  or  14  g/m2/day  (54.3%)  according  to  their 
individual BSA. In addition, majority of the subjects (92.9%) received an intensified regimen with i.v. 
Thiotepa. 
Criteria for Evaluation: 
Efficacy: 
Freedom  from  transplantation  (treatment)-related  mortality:  Freedom  from  transplant  (treatment)-
related mortality until 100 days after HSCT was assessed as the primary endpoint of the trial, and was 
defined as death from any transplant (treatment)-related cause from the day of first administration of 
conditioning treatment until 100 days after HSCT. This endpoint is a combination of TRM and treatment-
related mortality. Treatment-related deaths were defined as any death prior to HSCT. Treatment-related 
mortality was planned to be evaluated from the day of the first administration of trial medication, ie, 
visit Day -6, until HSCT but was finally evaluated from the day of the first administration of conditioning 
treatment,  ie,  visit  Day  -7,  until  HSCT.  For  TRM  refer  to  the  related  endpoint  “transplant-related 
mortality” 
Transplantation-related  mortality:  TRM  after  HSCT  was  defined  as  the  probability  of  dying  from  a 
transplant-related cause, i.e. which could not be attributed to disease relapse / progression or by deaths 
without previous relapse / progression. TRM was evaluated from end of HSCT to visit 12 months after 
HSCT. TRM was continuously assessed during the longer term follow up phase. 
Overall survival: OS after HSCT was defined as the probability of surviving and was evaluated from the 
end of HSCT up to the visit 12 months after HSCT. OS was continuously assessed during the longer term 
follow up phase. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/117245/2023

Relapse / Progression Incidence: The incidence of relapse / progression after HSCT was defined as the 
probability of having relapse / progression of the underlying disease, death due to any cause, or End of 
Trial, whatever comes first. RFS / PFS was continuously assessed during the longer term follow up phase. 
Relapse-free / Progression-free Survival: RFS / PFS until 12 months after HSCT was defined as the time 
length between end of HSCT and the date of relapse / progression of the underlying disease or death 
due to any cause, or End of Trial, whatever comes first. RFS / PFS was continuously assessed during the 
longer term follow up phase. 
Graft Failures: All subjects were continuously assessed for primary or secondary graft failure from end 
of the HST up to visit 12 months after HSCT. Secondary graft failure was continuously assessed during 
the longer term follow up phase. 
Non-relapse  Mortality:  NRM  after  HSCT  was  defined  as  the  probability  of  dying  in  the  absence  of 
persisting disease or previous occurrence of relapse / progression or graft failure. NRM was evaluated 
from end of the HSCT to visit 12 months after HSCT. NRM was continuously assessed during the longer 
term follow up phase. 
Engraftment: Engraftment was defined as neutrophil count > 0.5 x 109/L, leucocyte count > 1 x 109/L, 
and platelet counts > 20 x 109/L or > 50 x109/L) and assessed up to 100 days after HSCT. 
Donor-type Chimerism: Complete donor-type chimerism was defined as ≥ 95% donor cells detected and 
was evaluated on visit Day +28, +100 and the visit 12 months after HSCT. 
Event-free Survival: EFS was assessed as an additional exploratory endpoint of the trial and was defined 
as the length of time between end of HSCT and the date of relapse / progression, graft failure, or death 
(whatever occurs first). 
GvHD-free Relapse-free / Progression-free Survival: GvHD-free and RFS / PFS (GRFS) was assessed as 
an additional exploratory endpoint of the trial. 
Chronic GvHD-free and Relapse-free / Progression-free Survival: Chronic GvHD-free and RFS / PFS was 
also assessed as an additional exploratory endpoint of the trial. 
Rescue Therapies: Use of rescue therapies in order to prevent acute graft failure or disease relapse / 
progression was also assessed. 
Pharmacokinetics:  
Pharmacokinetics: Pharmacokinetic (PK) data were collected to contribute to a population model and to 
assess covariates. On day -6, blood samples were collected from a subset of subjects. 
Study participants 
This trial included paediatric subjects (infants / toddlers, children, and adolescents) with 
haematological malignant disease, who require myeloablative conditioning treatment followed by 
alloHSCT (first HSCT or second HSCT due to disease relapse, graft failure or secondary malignancy 
after previous autologous or alloHSCT). 
There was no gender-specific effects or adverse reactions (ARs) known or to be expected. Thus, male 
and female subjects were to be included into the trial. 
At least 70 evaluable male and female paediatric subjects from 28 days to < 18 years of age were to 
be included in this clinical trial and in the analysis. However, at least:

conditioning with TREO or BU (MC-FludT.14/L). Results comparing the month 12 data of MC-FludT.17/M 
trial with historical engraftment data are given. 
The  results of  the  primary  endpoint  were:  Overall,  the  rate  for  freedom  from transplant  (treatment)-
related mortality until 100 days after HSCT was 98.6% (90% CI: 93.4, 99.9). Due to the occurrence of 
only 1 event, no differential effects between subgroups could be identified. The respective subgroups in 
which the event appeared are shown in the forest plot. 
The key results of the exploratory analysis of the secondary endpoints were: 
1.  TRM: At the end of the longer-term follow-up period, 4 subjects (5.7%) had died from a transplant-
related cause. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of TRM at 12 months was 1.4% (90% CI: 0.3, 7.2) and 
increased to 4.6% (90% CI: 1.8, 11.4) at 36 months.

A statistically significant difference in TRM was recorded between CTP age groups; however, only few 
events were observed and small numbers of subjects were in these groups, which also cover different 
diseases and risk groups.

2.  OS: The median duration of follow-up based on reverse Kaplan-Meier estimate was 41.8 months 
(range of those surviving: 24.2 months to 57.5 months). At the end of the longer-term follow-up 
period, 58 subjects (82.9%) were alive. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of OS at 12 months after HSCT 
was 91.4% (90% CI: 83.9, 95.5) and was 84.3% (90% CI: 75.5, 90.1) at 36 months after HSCT. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/117245/2023

OS at 36 months was comparable for the disease groups, ie, 81.5% for ALL subjects, 86.2% for AML 
subjects, 90.0% for MDS subjects, and 75.0% for JMML subjects. Due to the individual BSA-related dose 
calculation,  OS  was  100%  in  the  10  g/m2/day  Treosulfan  group,  however  with  only  6  subjects,  and 
76.2% in the 14 g/m2/day Treosulfan group. As expected, a statistically significant difference in OS was 
recorded  between  subjects  in  first  HSCT  (36-month  rate:  86.1%)  and  subjects  in  second  HSCT  (36-
month rate: 60.0%); however, only few events were observed and only 5 subjects were in the latter 
group. A statistically significant difference in OS was also observed between the CTP age groups.

3.  Relapse  /  Progression  Incidence:  At  the  end  of  the  longer-term  follow-up  period,  16  subjects 
(22.9%)  had  experienced  disease  relapse  /  progression.  The  cumulative  incidence  of  relapse  / 
progression at 12 months was 15.7% (90% CI: 8.6, 22.9) and at 36 months was 23.0% (90% CI: 
14.7, 31.3). No relapse was observed beyond 24 months after HSCT.

In  the  disease  subgroups,  a  statistically  significant  difference  in  relapse  /  progression  was  recorded 
between JMML (75%), ALL (29.6%), AML (17.2%), and MDS (0.0%) subgroups; however, only small 
numbers of JMML and MDS subjects were in these groups. A statistically significant difference in relapse 
/ progression was also recorded between subjects in first HSCT (20.1%) and subjects in second HSCT 
(60.0%); however, only 5 subjects were in the second transplant group reflecting their poor prognosis 
in general.

4.  RFS / PFS until 12 months after HSCT: At the end of the longer-term follow-up period, 16 subjects 
(22.9%)  had  experienced disease  relapse  / progression  and  3  subjects  (4.3%)  had  died  without 
previous relapse / progression. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of RFS / PFS at 12 months was 82.9% 
(90% CI: 73.9, 89.0), reached a plateau at 24 months and remained 72.7% (90% CI: 62.7, 80.4) 
at 36 months after HSCT.

In the disease subgroups, a statistically significant difference in RFS / PFS was recorded between JMML 
(25.0%), ALL (66.7%), AML (79.3%), and MDS (88.9%) subgroups; however, only small numbers JMML 
and MDS subjects were in these groups. As expected, a statistically significant difference in RFS / PFS 
was  also  recorded  between  subjects  in  first  HSCT  (75.2%)  and  subjects  in  second  HSCT  (40.0%); 
however, only 5 subjects were in the second HSCT group. In contrast, no significant differences were 
observed between the different dose groups.

5.  Graft failure after HSCT: No subject experienced a primary graft failure and only 1 subject with 
ALL experienced a secondary graft failure. 
6.  NRM after HSCT: At the end of the longer-term follow-up period, 2 subjects (2.9%) had died without 
relapse or graft failure. The cumulative incidence of NRM at 12 months was 1.4% (90% CI: 0.0, 
3.8) and was only 2.9% (90% CI: 0.0, 6.1) at 36 months after HSCT.

to 78.0% (90% CI: 69.5, 86.5) at 28 days after HSCT. The maximum conditional cumulative incidence 
reached was 94.1% (90% CI: 88.4, 99.9). In the disease subgroups, a statistically significant difference 
in reconstitution of thrombopoiesis > 20 x 109/L was recorded between AML (100.0%), ALL (92.6%), 
MDS (90.0%), and JMML (75.0%) subgroups; however, only small number of MDS and JMML subjects

8.  Donor-type  Chimerism:  At  visit  Day  +28,  the  incidence  of  complete  donor-type  chimerism  was 
94.2% (90% CI: 87.2, 98.0), at visit Day +100 the incidence was 91.3% (90% CI: 83.6, 96.1), 
and  at  visit  Month  12  the  incidence  was  91.2%  (90%  CI:  82.4,  96.5).  In  the  subgroups,  a 
statistically significant difference was recorded for disease at visit Day +100 and at visit Month 12, 
and for the use of Thiotepa at visit Day +28. An incomplete donor-type chimerism was detected for 
3 subjects at visit Day +28. However, 2 of them developed a complete donor-type chimerism by 
visit Day +100. Only one subject with JMML was assessed with a mixed donor-type chimerism of 
only 12% on visit Day +28, further decreasing to 2% on visit Month 12 suggesting an autologous 
recovery of haematopoiesis. The detected Treosulfan AUC∞ (ie, 271 μg/h*mL) of this subject was 
far below the expected range considered safe and effective (760 to 3600 μg.h/mL). No relapse was 
reported for this subject until 12 months after HSCT.

Registry  study  on  treosulfan-conditioning  in  paediatric  patients  with 
malignant and non-malignant diseases 
Patients below 18 years with malignant or non-malignant disease who underwent HSCT between January 
2005 and July 2010 registered in the EBMT database were analysed.  
Selection of the treatment regimen 
Any TREO-based conditioning followed by allogeneic or autologous HSCT was analysed. 
Study endpoints 
The following endpoints were analysed: overall survival (OS) and causes of death, event-free survival 
(EFS),  relapse  incidence,  disease-related  mortality  (DRM),  transplantation-related  mortality  (TRM), 
engraftment, graft failure, acute and chronic graft versus host disease (aGvHD, cGvHD), specific adverse 
events (stomatitis, diarrhoea, vomiting, respiratory toxicity, liver toxicity, neurological toxicity. 
Study status 
843 patients met the inclusion criteria and 75% could be included into the analysis (533 allogeneic, 93 
autologous). In a supplemental analysis, data from 41 children below the age of 6 months were analysed 
for toxicity. 
Efficacy Results - Allogeneic HSCT 
Incidence of grade III/IV acute GvHD was 10% with no correlation with age. Incidence of limited and 
extensive chronic GvHD was 13% and 6%, respectively, again with no correlation with age. TREO dose 
had no significant impact on GvHD. Incidence of grade III/IV stomatitis, diarrhoea, and vomiting were 
22%, 24%, and 14%, respectively (no correlation with TREO dose). Incidence of grade III/IV respiratory 
toxicity was 12%. There is a significant association between age and respiratory toxicity. Children below 
the age of one year (mainly NMDs) experienced more grade III/IV respiratory toxicity. Incidence of grade 
III/IV hyperbilirubinemia, AST increase, and mild/severe VOD was 10%, 25%, and 5%, respectively.

CNS and peripheral neurological toxicity grade III/IV were 4% and 2%, respectively. There was more 
severe pulmonary toxicity in the youngest age group (> 6 months) compared to other age groups.  
Incidence of graft failure was 2%. There was no significant correlation of the rate of graft failure (within 
100 days) with age. Dose had no significant impact on the rate of graft failure in both univariate and 
multivariate analysis. Furthermore, there was no significant correlation of the time to engraftment (ANC 
> 0.5) with age and dose. 
There was a border-line significant impact of age on overall survival. The 3-year OS in children below 6 
months of age is 75%, children between 6 month and 1 year have a 3-year OS of 84%. The 3-year OS 
of children between 1-12 years and > 12 years was 70% and 60%, respectively. This difference is mainly 
caused  by  a  difference  in  disease  related  mortality  (DRM).  The  transplant  related  mortality  is  not 
significantly different in the different age groups. No significant impact of dose on overall survival could 
be found in univariate or adjusted analysis. There was a significant impact of age on EFS and 3-year EFS 
decrease with increasing age. 3-year EFS in patients less than 1 year of age, 1-12 years, and > 12 years 
was 75%, 62%, and 53%, respectively. This difference was mainly caused by a difference in the relapse 
incidence. 
Registry  study  on  treosulfan-conditioning  in  paediatric  patients  with  non-
malignant diseases 
The MAH asked the EBMT Paediatric and Inborn Error Working Party to have a look on the use of TREO 
and BU for the conditioning of children and adolescents who recently underwent HSCT for non-malignant 
diseases (NMD). The EBMT registry is the most comprehensive registry for HSCT in Europe, including 
536 transplant centres in 57 different countries including also non-EU-countries.  
The EBMT Paediatric and the EBMT Inborn Working party performed a retrospective EBMT registry study 
for the time period January 2010 to December 2014 according to EBMT guidelines. NMDs include huge 
varieties on congenital or acquired disorders of early and later childhood and are divided in the subgroups 
primary immunodeficiency (PID) - severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) [PID-SCID], PID-chronic 
granulomatous disease [PID-CGD)], PID-other, haemoglobinopathies, bone marrow failure syndromes, 
histiocytic disorders, and inherited disorders-other.  
Selection of the treatment regimen 
In the past five years, data from several hundreds of children with NMD who underwent either TREO-
based or BU-based conditioning therapy in combination with FLU were reported and included in the EBMT 
registry  data  base.  Moreover,  the  additional  use  of  TT  as  part  of  the  conditioning  regimen  was  of 
particular interest for the analysis. 
Study endpoints 
The following endpoints were analysed: overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), incidence of 
disease recurrence (IDR), transplantation-related mortality (TRM), engraftment, and acute and chronic 
graft versus host disease (aGvHD, cGvHD). 
Study status 
The  centre  survey  was  performed  in  February  2016  and  the  retrospective  EBMT-analysis  started  in 
September 2016 and was finished in May 2017.  
Efficacy Results 
Patients  with  NMD  who  are  eligible  for  HSCT  present  different  challenges  compared  to  those  with 
malignant diseases: children with inherited disorders such as SCID often come to transplant as infants

under one year of age with organ damage and co-morbidities. GvHD which may be associated with a 
beneficial graft-versus-leukaemia effect in patients with high risk haematological diseases, is of no added 
value  in  controlling  the  underlying  genetic  illness  and  may  adversely  affect  subsequent  immune 
reconstitution and have an unnecessarily negative impact on HSCT-related morbidity and quality of life 
in the short and long term outcome of patients with NMDs. On the other hand, graft rejection is a known 
severe complication.  
Data  from  several  hundreds  of  children  with  NMD  who  underwent  either  TREO-based  or  BU-based 
conditioning therapy in combination with FLU were reported and included in the EBMT registry data base. 
Moreover, the additional use of TT as part of the conditioning regimen was of particular interest for the 
analysis. TT is increasingly used with TREO-and BU-based conditioning because it has shown added value 
for preventing graft failure in patients with haemoglobinopathies and other diseases with high rejection 
risk. Additionally, TT is penetrating the brain which is supportive in correcting metabolic diseases with 
neurological impairment. 
This registry study included patients with PID-SCID (n = 320), PID-CGD (n = 202), PID-Wiskott (n = 
82), PID-other (n = 242), haemoglobinopathies (n = 590), bone marrow failure syndromes (n = 191), 
and histiocytic disorders (n = 183).  
The patients were grouped according to the given conditioning regimen, i.e. a combination of TREO/FLU 
(n  =  422),  BU/FLU  (n  =  1063),  TREO/FLU/TT  (n  =  473)  or  BU/FLU/TT  (n  =  220).  The  choice  of  the 
conditioning regimen before alloHSCT was under discretion of the treating physician. The median age at 
transplantation  was  3.7  years  (range  0-18  years)  and  was  significantly  different  for  the  conditioning 
groups (1.5 vs. 4 vs. 4.8 vs. 4.5, respectively; P < 0.001). Fifty-two percent of children were transplanted 
below 4 years of age, 489 patients were less than 12 months old, and 61.5% were male. Most patients 
received  a  stem  cell  graft  from  unrelated  donors  (52.3%),  followed  by  transplantation  from  an  HLA-
identical sibling or twin donor: 33.1% and 8.4% were grafted from a HLA-phenotypically identical family 
member  or  an  HLA-mismatched  family  member.  The  stem  cell  source  was  bone  marrow  (59.4%), 
peripheral blood stem cells (21.4%) or cord blood (17.9%), respectively. 
The use of TREO-based conditioning has significantly increased during the years, especially in children 
with inherited disorders and haemoglobinopathies. 
The  primary  outcome  parameters  of  this  retrospective  analysis  are  in  favour  for  the  combination  of 
TREO/FLU/TT with significantly better results in 1-year OS (89.5%; 95% CI 86.5-92.6%), day 100 TRM 
(4.8%; 95% CI 2.8-6.7%) and 1-year TRM (8.3%; 95% CI 5.5-11%). This translated also for DFS which 
was significantly best after TREO/FLU/TT conditioning (86%; 95% CI 82.6-89.5%).  
When  testing  for  univariate  Cox-regression,  TREO/FLU/TT  remained  superior  for  OS,  TRM  and  DFS 
compared  to  the  three  other  conditioning  regimens.  However,  when  adjusted  for  age  at  transplant, 
diagnosis, year of transplant, stem cell sources and donor type, the significances were not reached. 
Most patients with thalassaemia major (TM) and sickle cell disease (SCD) are nowadays transplanted 
after a conditioning regimen with TREO/FLU/TT and for TM-patients 1 year TRM is best after this drug 
combination.  In  contrast,  only  few  patients  with  SCID  received  a  TT-containing  regimen  because 
rejection risk is not as high as in haemoglobinopathies and there is no need to cross the blood-brain-
barrier. 
Outcome of patients with chronic granulomatous disease who were transplanted below 4 years of age or 
older than 12 years was excellent with no TRM and 100% OS when conditioned with a TREO-containing 
regimen. The group of patients with the highest treatment failures due to TRM are children above 4 years 
of  age  who  suffer  from  histiocytic  disorders.  Unfortunately,  so  far,  none  of  the  applied  conditioning 
regimen resulted in superior outcome.

When looking to other influencing factors in a multivariate Cox model, the underlying disease, age at 
transplantation and stem cell source was highly influencing OS, TRM and DFS with the worst prognosis 
for older patients, histiocytic disorders and cord blood as stem cell source. Year of transplantation did 
not  significantly  influence  the  primary  outcome.  TREO/FLU  ±  TT  showed  a  trend  for  better  outcome 
compared to BU/FLU ± TT and was never worse.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The current variation aims to include an additional non-malignant transplant indication in the paediatric 
population  for  Trecondi  1  g/5  g  powder  for  solution  for  infusion  based  on  final  12-months  follow-up 
results  of  study  MC-FludT.16/NM;  a  randomised  phase  II  interventional  study  aimed  to  compare 
Treosulfan-based  conditioning 
therapy  with  Busulfan-based  conditioning  prior 
to  allogeneic 
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in paediatric patients with non-malignant diseases.  
Moreover, the MAH proposes to introduce a slightly modified dosing regimen according to the patient’s 
body  surface  based  on  long-term  follow-up  data  of  paediatric  Phase  II  study  MC-FludT.17/M,  on  the 
efficacy  of  Treosulfan  based  conditioning  therapy  prior  to  allogeneic  haematopoietic  stem  cell 
transplantation in paediatric patients with haematological malignancies, as well as a final analysis of the 
population  pharmacokinetics  of  treosulfan  in  paediatric  patients.  Additionally,  one  meta-analysis  of 
engraftment data [Baumgart 2017] and two EBMT registry studies [Peters 2011, Peters 2017] on the 
use of TREO-based conditioning in paediatric patients with malignant and non-malignant diseases were 
performed and integrated into the data package.  
Considering  the  aim  of  the  current  variation  the  discussion  of  clinical  efficacy  is  focused  in  the  two 
paediatric clinical trials MC-FludT.16/NM and MC-FludT.17/M. 
A non-controlled trial (MC-FludT.17/M) with treosulfan (TREO)-based conditioning in combination with 
fludarabine  (FLU)  and  with  or  without  Thiotepa  (TT)  has  been  performed  in  paediatric  patients  with 
haematological malignancies (MD). Another randomised active-controlled trial in paediatric patients with 
non-malignant  diseases  (NMD)  and  where  TREO/FLU/TT  is  compared  with  busulfan  (BU)/FLU/TT  has 
been  completed  recently  (MC-FludT.16/NM).  Efficacy  data  with  TREO-based  conditioning  from  70 
patients with malignant and 51 patients with various non-malignant diseases have been assessed.  
Main  indications  for  alloHSCT  in  children  are  haematological  malignancies  such  as  ALL  (26%),  AML 
(14%),  and  MDS/MPS  (8%),  but  also  non-malignant  disorders  (NMD)  like  primary  immunodeficiency 
(PID; 16%), bone marrow failure (BMF; 12%), and thalassaemia (9%) [Passweg 2014]. However, the 
use  of  tresosulfan  as  part  of  the  conditioning-regimen  prior  alloHSCT  is  only  currently  approved  for 
paediatric patients with malignant disease.  
Assessment report

All  such  patients  were  included  in  the  two  above-mentioned  paediatric  trials  with  treosulfan-based 
conditioning besides published reports. 
AlloHSCT is a very complex treatment method which consists of the conditioning regimen, the infusion 
of  allogeneic  HSCs,  and  pre/post-transplant  immunosuppressive  measures  (GvHD  prevention).  The 
efficacy  of  the  conditioning  regimen  can  therefore  be  measured  only  in  the  context  of  the  whole 
transplant  procedure.  Engraftment  (as  conditional  cumulative  incidence  of  engraftment)  of  the  donor 
HSCs  is  the  only  parameter  which  is  generally  considered  directly  dependent  on  the  efficacy  of  a 
conditioning  therapy  and  as  such  it  was  selected  as  the  primary  endpoint  in  the  three  initial  non-
controlled trials in adult patients and included as a secondary endpoint in all other studies, including MC-
FludT.16/NM and MC-FludT.17/M.  
Almost  all  patients  achieve  engraftment  after  conditioning  with  TREO/FL  or  BU/FL  and  as  such  it  is 
accepted  that  it  was  not  the  primary  endpoint  in  the  assessed  trials.  Other  typical  efficacy  endpoints 
used in clinical trials with alloHSCT include cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), non-relapse mortality 
(NRM)  or  transplant-related  mortality  (TRM),  and  Graft  versus  Host  disease  (GvHD)  [Kim  2013]; 
considering the curative potential of this treatment also survival endpoints such as disease-free survival 
(DFS),  event-free  survival  (EFS),  and  overall  survival  (OS)  were  adequately  selected  as  secondary 
endpoint. 
For the MC-FludT.16/NM and MC-FludT.17/M trials and upon request from PDCO, the selected primary 
endpoint was Freedom from transplant (treatment) related mortality until day +100 after HSCT, defined 
as death from any transplant-related cause from start of conditioning treatment (day -7) until day +100 
after HSCT. The analysis of the estimates from Kaplan-Meier for freedom from TRM until Day+100 after 
alloHSCT indicates that both treosulfan and busulfan give good results but the treosulfan behaves better 
with 0% (.16/NM) or 1.4% subjects (.17/M) with event for treosulfan vs 10% for busulfan (unadjusted 
p-value 0.0267; adjusted p-value 0.0528). 
Transplant-related mortality (KM estimates) after TREO-based conditioning was very low in patients with 
both non-malignant (3.9%) as well as malignant diseases (5.7%) but somewhat higher with BU in no-
malignant diseases (14.0%) (HR (TREO/BU) 0.29 (90% CI 0.0, 1.09); p value 0.1244). This was also 
seen in the EBMT registry analysis with no influence of age or dose of treosulfan and significantly lower 
TRM  for  TREO/FLU/TT  than  for  BU/FLU/TT  conditioning  [Peters  2017].  In  both  treatments  for  non-
malignant diseases the TRM was maintained over time however it increases after 2 years in malignant 
disease with treosulfan.  
TREO dosing in the paediatric studies aimed to reach TREO plasma levels in the range observed with the 
14 g/m² dose in adults. The data from both studies suggest that paediatric patients tolerate TREO-based 
conditioning better than adult patients and justify that there was no need to reduce the TREO dose in 
this patient population. Even so some adjustment of the TREO dose according with patient’s BSA is being 
proposed in the current variation and justification for that proposal and clarification of some other PK-
related issues were provided (see above Discussion on Clinical Pharmacology). 
Overall survival at 3 years after TREO-based conditioning was 84.3% (95% CI 75.5-90.1%) in patients 
with  malignant  diseases  and  similar  to  BU-based  conditioning  in  patients  with  non-malignant  disease 
(84.0%; 95% CI 75.5-90.1%). The later patients when treated with TREO presented a numerically (p 
value 0.1244) better OS (96.1%) than BU with an HR (TREO/BU) of 0.29 (90% CI 0.08, 1.09). This is 
also seen from the data available from the EBMT registry specially after a first HSCT [Peters 2011] and 
statistically significance is seen in the case of non-malignant diseases at 1 year (89.5% for TREO/FLU/TT 
vs 81.3%; for BU/FLU/TT (log rank test P = 0.012)[Peters 2017]. 
The maximum conditional cumulative incidence of neutrophil engraftment was 97.3% in patients with 
non-malignant diseases for TREO and 100% for BU and for TREO in patients with malignant diseases.

Median  duration  of  neutropenia  was  significantly  longer  with  TREO  compared  to  BU  in  trial  MC-
FludT.16/NM  (20  days  vs.  14.5  days)  (p  value  0.0108).  The  MAH  justifies  this  difference  with  an 
imbalance in the underlying diseases of both treatment arms but the same duration is seen in the case 
of  TREO  treatment  in  paediatric  patients  with  malignant  diseases  which  may  require  more  close 
monitoring  of  these  patients  when  under  treatment  with  TREO.  Similar  data  were  obtained  for  the 
reconstitution of leukopoiesis (96.8% TREO-NMD, 100% BU-NMD and 100% TREO-MD; p value 0.2469) 
and  thrombopoiesis  (>20x109/L:  100%  TREO-NMD,  96.8%  BU-NMD  and  94.1%  TREO-MD  –  p  value 
0.8595; >50x109/L: 94.8% TREO-NMD, 97.1% BU-NMD and 91.9% TREO-MD – p value 0.3635). These 
data  are  also  in  line  with the  meta-analysis  of  engraftment  data  from  trial  MC-FludT.17/M,  published 
paediatric data, and data from each of the arms of the two active-controlled studies in adult patients 
(MC-FludT.14/L  Trials  I/II),  as  per  the  PIP  [Baumgart  2017]  and  with  the  date  from  the  two  meta-
analyses  of  the  EBMT  [Peters  2011].  However,  in  patients  with  non-malignant diseases  [2017  EBMT; 
Peters 2017], a significant correlation between conditioning treatment and neutrophil engraftment was 
observed for those patients who additionally received thiotepa (TT) with at day +100 after alloHSCT only 
83.5% of patients reached neutrophil engraftment in the BU/FLU/TT group compared to 96.1% in the 
TREO/FLU/TT cohort. Only 2 of 121 paediatric patients (NMD and MD) (1.7%) treated with TREO-based 
or with BU-based conditioning had a primary graft failure; however in the case of NMD treatment with 
TREO seems to lead to higher rate of secondary graft failure (18.4% TREO-NMD vs 0% BU-NMD vs 1.4% 
TREO-MD) but all the graft failures in the TREO-NMD occurred in patients who had received a transplant 
from a matched unrelated donor which may explain the outcome. 
The incidence of complete donor-type chimerism was lower in the patients treated with TREO with non-
malignant diseases compared to the patients with malignant diseases up to 24 months and also lower 
than with BU-treatment from Day+100 onwards. 
Event-free survival was assessed as an additional exploratory endpoint in both paediatric trials. Overall 
EFS rates are similar for the TREO treatment in both NMD and MD patients and decreases with time for 
NMD ad reaches a plateau at 2 years for MD being higher (although non-significantly, p value 0.3343) 
for TREO than for BU-treatment (HR 1.54 (90% CI 0.74, 3.22). Nevertheless, this is due to mostly due 
to secondary graft failure and no on death number, where BU treatment has higher rate (3.9% TREO vs 
12.0%  BU).  This  follows  the  data  available  from  the  EBMT  registry  analysis  [Peters  2011]  which  also 
indicates some influence of age likely related with difference in relapse incidence. 
The  cumulative  incidence of  relapse/progression  in the  70  patients  with  MD treated  with  TREO-based 
conditioning in trial MC-FludT.17/M was 23.0% at 24 and 36 months with 15.7% (n=11) of these patients 
requiring  rescue  therapy  mainly  of  donor  lymphocyte  infusion  (DLI)  or  stem  cell  boost.  Patients  with 
non-malignant diseases required more rescue therapies (41.2%; especially transfusions for RBCs [33%] 
and platelets [27.5%]) than patients with malignant diseases. Nevertheless, no difference is observed 
regarding rescue therapies between the two treatment arms of the MC-FludT.16/NM trial. This is aligned 
with data on incidence of disease relapse (IDR) in these patients available from the EBMT registry [Peters 
2017]. Of note, in the disease subgroups of the MC-FludT.17/M trial, a statistically significant difference 
in relapse/progression was recorded between JMML (75%), ALL (29.6%), AML (17.2%), and MDS (0.0%) 
subgroups; however, these results may be due to the small number of subjects with these pathologies 
included in the study as well with the general poor prognosis of these pathologies. 
Overall the efficacy results of the first randomised Phase II alloHSCT trial (MC-FludT.16/NM) in paediatric  
patients  with  non-malignant  diseases  demonstrated  a  benefit  for  the  treosulfan  conditioning  regimen 
over busulfan conditioning regimen in the selected subject population regarding Freedom from transplant

and  EFS  despite  a  higher  rate  of  secondary  graft  failures  and  lower  complete  donor-type  chimerism.

Therefore, in children with non-malignant diseases indicated for alloHSCT the risk of graft failure must 
be carefully weighed against the risk of TRM when choosing the conditioning regimen. 
The second Phase II trial in paediatric patients with malignant haematological disease (MC-FludT.17/M) 
has shown that a BSA-adapted i.v. dose of 10 g/m2, 12 g/m2, or 14 g/m2 Treosulfan given on Days -6, 
-5, and 4 can be successfully used as conditioning treatment before alloHSCT in the selected paediatric 
population. After two rounds of assessment, the selected BSA-adapted dosing and additional PK issues 
were adequately justified/clarified (see above Discussion on Clinical Pharmacology). 
Most of the subjects (92.9%) were treated with the intensified conditioning regimen (Thiotepa in addition 
to Fludarabine). The primary endpoint of the trial in paediatric patients with malignant diseases and of 
the trial in paediatric population with non-malignant disease treated with treosulfan, the rate for freedom 
from  transplant  (treatment)-related  mortality  until  100  days  after  HSCT,  was  98.6%  (90%  CI:  93.4, 
99.9) and 100% (90% CI: 94.3, 100), respectively indicating the tolerability and safety of this regimen 
in  both  conditions  with  favourable  outcome  when  compared  with  busulfan-containing  regimen  (90%; 
90% CI: 80.1, 96.0). The detailed safety analysis along with the Kaplan Meier estimation of NRM at 12 
months and 36 months supports this observation. 
Based  on  the  engraftment  and  chimerism  data  approaching  100%  and  >  90%,  respectively,  efficacy 
parameters  like  EFS,  OS,  and  GvHD-free  and  relapse-free  survival  confirm  the  effectiveness  of  this 
conditioning  treatment.  Statistically  significant  unfavourable  results  for  JMML  and  second  HSCT 
subgroups with regard to relapse / progression as well as the survival parameters were noted. However, 
these results may be due to the small number of subjects with the pathologies included in the study as 
well with the general poor prognosis of these pathologies.  
In overall, the efficacy of treosulfan as part of the conditioning treatment conditioning treatment prior 
to alloHSCT in paediatric patients with non-malignant diseases is based on the following 
considerations:  
•  The  final  analysis  of  MC-FludT.14/L Trial  II  has  confirmed  the  non-inferiority  of  TREO-based 
conditioning  compared  to  reduced-intensity  conditioning  therapy  based  on  intravenous  BU. 
Additionally, superiority of TREO versus BU could now be shown with the final data set.  
•  The  final  analysis  of  MC-FludT.14/L Trial  II  has  confirmed  the  non-inferiority  of  TREO-based 
conditioning  compared  to  reduced-intensity  conditioning  therapy  based  on  intravenous  BU. 
Additionally, superiority of TREO versus BU could now be shown with the final data set.  
•  Furthermore, both paediatric studies have been completed. Final CSRs are now available, with 
3-year follow-up survival data for study MC-FludT.17/M and 1-year follow-up data for study MC-
FludT.16/NM.  
•  Moreover, the PopPK model for TREO was updated and the BSA-adapted dose regimen of TREO 
in paediatric patients slightly modified. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, the reported efficacy results of these two Phase II allo-HSCT trials resulted in a benefit for the 
Treosulfan-based  conditioning  regimen  used  in  paediatric  patients  with  selected  malignant  diseases, 
confirming the approved indication as well as in paediatric patients with selected non-malignant diseases 
in respect to a Busulfan-based condition regimen and thus to allow to support the extension of the use 
of Treosulfan to this population. 
As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated as well as the Package 
Leaflet.

The MAH agreed to a CHMP recommendation to submit the final study report of study MC-FludT.16/NM 
when available. This is of interest as allo-HSCT will be applied in the treatment for non-malignant 
diseases with the expectation of long-term treatment benefit. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The most commonly reported undesirable effects of treosulfan are myelosuppression (leukocytopenia, 
thrombocytopenia, anaemia) and gastrointestinal complaints (nausea, vomiting). They are usually mild 
and resolve after treatment.  
Bone marrow suppression is the dose-limiting side effect. However, it is this toxicity that supported the 
development of TREO for conditioning treatment prior to HSCT, especially in the allogenic setting. For 
this indication, TREO is always combined with FLU. Most paediatric patients receive additionally thiotepa 
(TT). This conditioning regimen is followed by infusion of haematopoietic stem cells. Furthermore, other 
immunosuppressive agents are usually given concomitantly or shortly thereafter.  
Bone  marrow  depression 
(neutropenia, 
leukocytopenia, 
thrombocytopenia,  anaemia)  and 
immunosuppression  are  therefore  desired  therapeutic  effects  of  the  conditioning  regimen  and 
consequently cannot be considered as undesirable effects. Therefore, any changes in blood counts and 
differential  blood  counts  occurring  between  Day  -6  and  Day  +28  had  not  to  be  documented  as  AEs. 
Especially during the time of bone marrow aplasia induced by the conditioning regimen, infections may 
develop and are a major source of morbidity and mortality of patients. 
Hyperbilirubinemia,  mucositis/stomatitis,  seizures,  and  HSOS  (formerly  designated  as  veno-occlusive 
disease/VOD)  are  considered  as  significant  adverse  events  of  conditioning  treatment  followed  by 
alloHSCT.  These  significant  AEs  were  of  special  interest  in  all  clinical  studies  with  TREO-based 
conditioning. 
Graft versus host disease (GvHD) is commonly observed after alloHSCT. GvHD is considered not related 
to TREO but to the engraftment of the allogeneic immune system. How much the conditioning regimen 
influences the frequency and severity of GvHD is a matter of debate. Therefore, incidences of acute and 
chronic GvHD were intensively monitored in all studies. 
Facing  the  above,  the  adverse  events  (AEs)  and  adverse  reactions  (ARs)  observed  with  TREO-based 
conditioning  followed  by  alloHSCT  are  not  only  due  to  TREO  alone  but  relate  to  the  whole  complex 
treatment procedure of alloHSCT.  
Study  MC-FludT.16/NM  was  performed  against  busulfan  (BU)-containing  regimen.  Busulfan  is  also 
used for conditioning prior to alloHSCT, mostly together with FLU or CY. Important ARs of conditioning 
regimens with BU/FLU followed by alloHSCT include infections or reactivation of opportunistic infectious 
pathogens, nervous system disorders, eye disorders, cardiac disorders, vascular disorders, respiratory 
thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders  ,  gastrointestinal  disorders,  hepato-biliary  disorders,  skin  and 
subcutaneous  tissue  disorders,  musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders,  renal  and  urinary 
disorders,  reproductive  system  and  breast  disorders  ,  general  disorders  and  administration  site 
conditions  and investigations. Such ARs could potentially also be observed with TREO.  
In order to support pooled analyses of medical coded terms across all TREO trials, AEs of all studies were 
recoded according to MedDRA Version 20.0.  
The results are summarised in an integrated summary of safety (ISS 2021; Report location: CTD Section 
5.3.5.3). The primary objective of this ISS was to characterise the safety profile of TREO in the transplant 
Assessment report

setting,  for  adult  and  paediatric  population.  The  characterisation  of  TREO’s  undesirable  effects  and 
respective frequencies is reflected in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) which has been 
updated in the current variation in respect to Summary of the safety profile, as well as the Tabulated list 
of adverse reactions for Paediatric population and Description of selected adverse reactions.  
Patient exposure 
A total 121 paediatric patients have been treated with TREO-based conditioning, including 51 patients 
with  non-malignant  diseases  (primary  immunodeficiency,  haemoglobinopathy,  inborn  error  of 
metabolism and bone marrow failure syndromes) and 70 patients with malignant diseases (AML, ALL, 
MDS, and JMML).  
The study in non-malignant diseases (MC-FludT.16/NM) also included an active-control group with 50 
evaluable patients treated with the reference conditioning regimen BU/FLU ± TT. 
This safety data set is supplemented by safety data derived from two registry studies of the EBMT [Peters 
201193;  Peters  2017]  which  included  a  total  of  1  521  paediatric  patients  with  malignant  and  non-
malignant diseases who had been treated with TREO-based conditioning. Therefore, available safety data 
cover all paediatric patients which are currently treated with alloHSCT. 
The majority of patients received the intensified regimen with thiotepa and a transplant from a matched 
unrelated donor.

For treatment of infants and smaller children consideration a population-pharmacokinetic model for dose 
calculation was developed. According to this model, body surface area was the only clinically relevant 
covariate  for  plasma  clearance  and  volume  of  distribution  of  TREO  (see  above  section  5.3.2. 
Pharmacokinetics and LoQ). The proposed dose regimen for TREO in children therefore ranges from 
10-14 g/m²/d, given on days -6 to -4. 
Adverse events (overall) 
The  following  table  gives  an  overall  summary  of  AEs  observed  in  the  two  paediatric  trials.  In  the  BU 
group, more patients than in the TREO group experienced life-threatening SAEs and SAEs resulting in 
death as well as drug-related SAEs. In the TREO group, more patients than in the BU group experienced 
SAEs that required hospitalisation or prolongation of hospitalisation.

Treatment-emergent adverse events 
The most frequently observed TEAEs after TREO-based conditioning include: gastrointestinal disorders 
(90.9%;  includes  stomatitis  [74.4%],  vomiting  [67.8%],  diarrhoea  [62.8%],  nausea  [38.8%], 
abdominal  pain  [37.2%],  and  constipation  [13.2%]),  pyrexia  (71.9%),  infections  (63.6%),  skin  and 
subcutaneous  tissue  disorders  (58.7%;  includes  maculopapular  rash  [27.3%],  pruritus  [22.3%],  and 
alopecia  [9.9%];  Dermatitis  diaper  may  occur  in  small  children  because  of  excretion  of  TREO  in  the 
urine. Therefore, diapers should be changed frequently up to 6-8 hours after each infusion of TREO), 
hepatotoxicity  (41.3%),  investigations  (37.2%;  includes  increased  ALT  [13.2%],  positive  viral  test 
[11.6%],  increased  AST  [9.9%],  and  increased  bilirubin  [9.9%]),  hypertension  (33.9%),  headache 
(27.3%), pain in extremity (18.2%), cough (19.0%), hypokalaemia (11.6%), hypersensitivity (10.7%), 
and sinus tachycardia (10.7%).   
The most frequent (> 10%) severe at least CTCAE grade III TEAEs in the two paediatric trials include 
infections  (38.0%),  stomatitis  (35.5%),  diarrhoea  (14.0%),  nausea  (12.4%),  vomiting  (12.4%),  and 
hypertension  (11.6%).  There  was  a  significant  association  between  age  and  respiratory  toxicity  in 
paediatric patients in the EBMT registry [Peters 2011]. Children below the age of one year (mainly non-
malignant  diseases)  experienced  more  respiratory  grade  III/IV  toxicity.  This  observation  could  be 
explained by the fact that it is likely that babies underwent HSCT for immunodeficiencies, i.e. diseases 
which are often associated with severe pulmonary infections even before HSCT. 
More patients (> 5% difference) transplanted for malignant versus non-malignant diseases experienced 
viremia (20.0% vs. 2.0%), device-related infection (11.4% vs. 3.9%), hypersensitivity reactions (17.1% 
vs. 2.0%), hypokalaemia (15.7% vs. 5.9%), psychiatric disorders (7.1% vs. 0%), nausea (45.7% vs. 
29.4%),  bone  pain  (10.0%  vs.  0%),  positive  viral  test  (20%  vs.  0%),  and  increased  blood  bilirubin 
(12.9% vs. 5.9%). 
Epistaxis  (2.9%  vs.  15.7%),  abdominal  pain  (31.4%  vs.  45.1%),  hepatotoxicity  (34.3%  vs.  51.0%), 
pruritus (18.6% vs. 27.5%), alopecia (1.4% vs. 21.6%), increased CRP (0% vs. 11.8%), and infusion-
related reaction (7.1% vs. 17.6%) were more frequently seen in patients transplanted for non-malignant 
diseases.

The  frequency  of  TEAEs  was  broadly  similar  in  the  2 treatment  arms  of  study  16/NM,  with  a  few 
exceptions. Differences ≥ 10% for TREO vs. BU were seen for diarrhoea (58.8% vs. 46.0%), abdominal 
pain (45.1% vs. 30.0%), lung infection (2.0% vs. 12.0%), dry skin (0% vs. 10.0%) and maculo-papular 
rash (25.5% vs. 14.0%) while more patients in the BU arm compared to the TREO arm experienced (BU 
vs TREO) oral mucositis (48.0% vs. 27.5%), nausea (18.0% vs. 5.9%). Differences ≥ 5% TREO vs. BU 
were seen for infections (39.2% vs. 34.0%), febrile neutropenia (7.8% vs. 0%), and vascular events 
(19.6% vs. 12.0%), whereas more patients in the BU vs TREO presented vomiting (14.0% vs. 7.8%) 
and respiratory disorders (18.0% vs. 7.8%). 
Drug-related TEAEs 
The  most  frequently  (≥ 5%)  observed  TREO-related  TEAEs  include  stomatitis  (66.1%),  vomiting 
(42.1%), diarrhoea (33.1%), nausea (26.4%), hepatotoxicity (26.4%), abdominal pain (16.5%), pyrexia 
(13.2%),  infections  (11.6%),  ALT  increased  (10.7%),  and  pruritus  (10.7%).  Most  frequent  (≥ 5%) 
severe  ARs  (≥ Grade  III)  after  TREO-based  conditioning  include  stomatitis  (32.2%),  nausea  (8.3%), 
diarrhoea (7.4%), and infections (5.0%). The overall incidence of drug-related infections (11.6%) in 121 
paediatric patients was slightly higher to that seen in adults and a frequency higher in the paediatric age 
group 12-17 years (6 of 39 [15.4%]) compared to infants < 2 years of age (1 of 23 [4.3%]) but the 
limited  number  of  patients  included  into  the  two  paediatric  studies  is  insufficient  to  reach  to  final 
conclusions. 
Drug-related TEAEs were reported by 74.0% of subjects in the BU arm, and 80.4% of subjects in the 
TREO  arm.  Substantial  differences  (>  10%  difference)  between  the  2  treatment  arms  (BU  vs.  TREO) 
were seen in the incidence of diarrhoea (22.0% vs. 39.2%), nausea (30.0% vs. 17.6%), abdominal pain 
(12.0% vs. 23.5%), other hepatobiliary disorders (46.0% vs. 33.3%), and pruritus (4.0% vs. 15.7%). 
Drug-related TEAEs with at least CTCAE grade III TEAEs were reported by 50.0% of patients in the BU 
arm,  and  51.0%  of  patients  in  the  TREO  arm.  There  was  a  substantial  difference  (> 10%  difference) 
between the 2 treatment arms in the incidence of oral mucositis (BU vs. TREO: 36.0% vs. 25.5%). 
The  most  frequent  AR  reported  in  blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders  SOC  category  was  febrile 
neutropenia, which was recorded in only 2 of 121 paediatric patients (1.7%) treated with TREO-based 
conditioning. 
In  respect  to  endocrine  disorders,  data  from  a  retrospective,  multicentre  study  of  137  children 
undergoing  alloHSCT,  indicate  that  the  frequency  of  gonadal  damage  associated  with  TREO  was 
significantly lower than that observed after BU [Faraci 2019]. This is a small study where very few TREO-
based treated patients were included (19) versus BU-based treated patients (118), but this observation 
is corroborated by data from a more recent study [Leiper 2020] where the fertility in survivors of HSCT 
after  three  chemotherapy-conditioning  regimens  of  different  intensity  which  included  TREO-based, 
BU/cyclophosphamide (BU/Cy) and Fludarabine/melphalan (Flu-Mel) containing regimens was assessed 
by  measuring  serum  concentrations  of  Anti-Müllerian  hormone  (AMH)  and  Inhibin  B.  The  MAH  data 
obtained suggested less ovarian reserve impairment after TREO and Flu-Mel than after Bu-Cy and the 
mean serum AMH concentration was significantly better with treosulfan (>1.0 μg/L) than with Flu-Mel 
or  Bu-Cy.  The  same  more  favourable  trend  for  TREO-based  conditioning  regimen  is  seen  in  males 
regarding Inhibin B data with the Flu-Mel group suffering greatest impairment. These authors reach the 
same conclusion, that a TREO-based regimen confers a more favourable gonadal compromise than Flu-
Mel or Bu-Cy in both sexes. 
Only 5 paediatric patients developed neurological ARs (3 x headache, 2 x paraesthesia, 1 x seizure) after 
TREO-based conditioning. Only two paediatric patients developed ARs belonging to Eye disorders SOC 
category.  Only  three  vascular  disorders  related  ARs  (Capillary  leak  syndrome,  hypertension, 
hypotension) were seen in paediatric patients. No paediatric patient developed ARs belonging to ear and

labyrinth  disorders  or  cardiac  disorders.  Two  cases  of  acute  kidney  injury  (AKI)  were  seen  in  the 
paediatric studies (1.7%). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The  following  table  summarises  the death  cases  in  the  two  paediatric  trials.  Death  rate  in  paediatric 
patients after TREO-based conditioning was much lower than that observed in adult patients. Only 14 of 
121  patients  (11.6%)  included  so  far  into  the  two  paediatric  trials  died,  and  only  6  (5.0%)  from 
transplant-related  causes.  In  the  study  in  patients  with  non-malignant  diseases  more  patients  died 
transplant-related in the BU group compared to the TREO group (7 vs. 2). Only two patients in the TREO 
group died in MU-FludT.16/NM trial so far.  
Data in paediatric patients with non-malignant diseases are also available from the 2017 EBMT registry 
[Peters 2017] and also show a lower number of death cases with TREO/FLU/TT versus BU/FLU/TT (10.1% 
vs. 17.0%). The most common causes of death after HSCT for non-malignant diseases were infection, 
graft  versus  host  disease,  the original  disease  and transplant  associated  organ  complications.  Deaths 
due to graft failure or due to secondary malignancies were rare events. 
Table  2.7.4.2.1.4.3-1  shows  the  incidence  of  selected  significant  AEs  observed  in  the  two  paediatric 
trials. No pulmonary fibrosis was seen. In trial MC-FludT.16/NM, more patients in the BU arm developed 
HSOS (5 versus 1). All other parameters were comparable in both groups.

Other Serious Adverse Events 
The  frequency  of  SAEs  occurring  in  at  least  2  of  the  total  121  patients  treated  with  TREO  within  two 
clinical studies in paediatric patients is shown in the table below. Results are comparable in both trials. 
A total of 41 of 121 paediatric patients (33.9%) experienced an SAE after TREO-based conditioning. Most 
frequent SAEs were infection (22.3%), pyrexia (6.6%) and febrile neutropenia (2.5%). 
Frequency of SAEs was also comparable in both groups of trial MC-FludT.16/NM, with the occurrence of 
more infections and more general disorders (all cases were fever) in the TREO group.

The following table summarises the results of aGvHD observed in the two paediatric trials. Incidences 
were slightly higher in patients with non-malignant diseases. The cumulative incidence of aGvHD after 
TREO-based  conditioning  in  the  two  paediatric  studies  was  54.9%  in  patients  with  non-malignant 
diseases and 43.5% in patients with malignant diseases. This incidence is comparable to that observed 
in adult patients. 
Results of GvHD from the two EBMT registry studies indicate that the incidence of grade III/IV aGvHD 
after TREO-based conditioning was 10% with no significant correlation with age. Also, the TREO dose 
had no significant impact on aGvHD in both univariate and multivariate analysis adjusted for diagnoses, 
age, number of HSCTs, remission status, donor and conditioning regimen. For malignant diseases, there 
was a borderline significant impact of age-group on the incidence of aGvHD of any grade (P = 0.045), 
the  aGvHD-incidence  is  monotonously  decreasing  with  age  [Peters  2011  (chapter  3.1.1)].  For  non-
malignant diseases, there is no significant association between grade III/IV toxicity and dose-group in 
the subgroups of patients according to donor type, and diagnoses [Peters 2011].

Cumulative incidence of cGvHD was higher in the BU arm of trial MC-FludT.16/NM. 
No significant correlation between the rate of cGvHD and age was found. For all alloHSCT, TREO dose 
had no significant impact on cGvHD in both univariate analysis and multivariate analysis adjusted for 
diagnoses, age, number of HSCTs, remission status, donor and conditioning regimen.  
Secondary malignancies are well established complications in long-term survivors after alloHSCT. Two 
children  treated  in  trial  MC-FludT.17/M  developed  skin  papilloma  after  TREO-based  conditioning.  One 
patient treated in the TREO arm of trial MC-FludT.16/NM developed MDS. In a retrospective analysis of 
944 children who underwent HSCT for  PID at two UK centres, 12 patients (1.27%) developed a non-
posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder malignancy. Three of these patients had received a TREO-
based conditioning regimen [Unni 2018]. Primary immunodeficiencies are diseases associated with an 
increased risk for neoplasias per se. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology: In trial MC-FludT.16/NM, the median level of WBCs at baseline was similar in the two 
treatment  arms.  The  median  level  of  WBC  fell  severely  after  Day  -3.  The  lowest  median  value  was 
recorded at Day +6 for both treatment arms, 0.08 G/L in the BU arm and 0.02 G/L in the TREO arm. 
The median value in both arms rose steadily from this point, and at Day +100 the median value was 
3.23 G/L for the BU arm, and 4.40 G/L for the TREO arm. In trial MC-FludT.17/M, the median WBC level 
at baseline was 1.99 G/L (Q1 1.42; Q3 3.34). The level of WBC fell severely at visit Day -1 and continued 
to fall further with continuation of conditioning treatment. The lowest median value was recorded at visit

Day +6, 0.02 G/L (Q1: 0.01; Q3: 0.05). The median value rose steadily from this point, and at visit Day 
+100 the median value was 3.57 G/L (Q1: 2.30; Q3: 5.33). 
Clinical  chemistry:  Incidence  of  increased  bilirubin/ALT/AST  in  121  paediatric  TREO  patients  was 
6.6%/10.7%/  6.6%,  comparable  to  the  data  seen  in  adults.  In  trial  MC-FludT.16/NM  no  significant 
differences between both treatment groups were seen. Median levels of liver parameters were always 
below the upper limit of normal (ULN) with the exception of ALT which was slightly elevated at Day +6; 
median levels of electrolytes (sodium, potassium) did not much change from baseline in both treatment 
groups;  median  levels  of  CRP  and  procalcitonin  increased  after  conditioning  treatment  but  values 
normalized  up  to  Day  +28.  The  other  parameters  were  relatively  unaffected.  In  trial  MC-FludT.17/M, 
baseline values of the liver function parameters (ALT, AST, γGT, AP, bilirubin) showed a considerable 
variability. Only γGT and bilirubin showed a significant increase of values compared to baseline while the 
other parameters were always below ULN. No SAE related to a change in laboratory values was reported; 
median  levels  of  electrolytes  did  not  much  change  from  baseline;  median  values  of  LDH,  CRP  and 
procalcitonin  increased  to  some  extent  after  baseline  but  CRP  and  procalcitonin  rapidly  returned  to 
normal values. 
Vital signs, physical findings, and other observations related to safety 
In trial MC-FludT.16/NM, treatment with TREO did not remarkably influence systolic or diastolic blood 
pressure, pulse rate and body temperature. Six patients in the BU arm (12.0%) and 8 patients in the 
TREO  arm  (15.7%)  experienced  CTCAE  grade III  “Hypertension”.  No  patient  in  the  BU  arm  but  one 
patient  in  the  TREO  arm  experienced  CTCAE  grade III  “Hypotension”.  No  CTCAE  grade IV  event  was 
reported. The median Karnofsky/Lansky Performance Score (KPS/LPS) did not change significantly and 
usually ranged between 90 and 100. The Kaplan Meier estimate at 12 months for subjects showing a 
deterioration to less than 60 points was 8.3% in the TREO group and 12.7% in the BU group. 
In  trial  MC-FludT.17/M,  treatment  with  TREO  did  not  remarkably  influence  systolic  or  diastolic  blood 
pressure,  pulse  rate  and  body  temperature.  Five patients  reported  AE  of  CTCAE  Grade III  Term 
“Hypertension” (all resolved, except for 1 patient with not recovered/not resolved), 1 patient reported 
AE  for  each  CTCAE  Grade III  Term  “Hypotension”  and  “Fever”  (both  resolved).  The  median 
Karnofsky/Lansky Performance Score (KPS/LPS) did not change significantly and usually ranged between 
90 and 100. The overall Kaplan-Meier estimate at 12 months for subjects showing a deterioration to less 
than 60 points was 13.6% (90% CI 7.3, 24.5).

Safety: 
Freedom from transplantation (treatment)-related mortality & Transplantation-related mortality: refer 
to efficacy evaluation. 
Acute GvHD: Time to aGvHD was defined as the time between end of HSCT and the date of first 
occurrence of aGvHD. Acute GvHD was evaluated from the end of HSCT until 100 days after 
transplantation. 
Assessment report

Chronic GvHD: Time to cGvHD was defined as the time between 100 days after end of HSCT and the 
first episode of cGvHD. Chronic GvHD was evaluated from 100 days after transplantation until the end 
of the longer-term follow-up. 
Adverse events: All adverse events (AEs) (serious and non-serious) occurring between day -7 and day 
+100 were recorded continuously. After day +100, only serious AEs with suspected relatedness 
(serious adverse reactions [SAR]) to the investigational medicinal product (IMP) were documented up 
to the end of the longer-term follow-up phase. 
Clinical  laboratory  tests:  The  subject’s  viral  status  was  characterised  by  HIV,  cytomegalovirus,  EBV, 
hepatitis A, B, C, and herpes tests within 3 weeks prior to day -7. Pregnancy was assessed routinely in 
the  subject’s  urine  or  serum  within  3  weeks  prior  to  day  -7,  in  any  female  who  had  experienced 
menarche.  The  standard  laboratory  parameters  (total  blood  count,  differential  blood  count,  serum 
chemistry, were documented once within 3 weeks prior to Day -7 (also for calculated GFR), at given time 
points between visit Day -7 and Day +28, and at visit Day +100 (total and differential blood count only). 
Vital signs, physical examinations: Blood pressure, pulse, height, weight, and body temperature were 
assessed between day - 10 and day -8, blood pressure, pulse, and body temperature were assessed in 
addition at visit Day 0, +28, +100, Month 6, 9, and 12. Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) or Lansky 
Performance Score (LPS) were assessed within 3 weeks prior to Day - 7, and at visit Day 0, Day +28, 
Day +100, Month 6, 9, and 12.

Criteria for Evaluation: 
Safety: 
Adverse events (AEs): All AEs (serious and non serious) occurring between day -7 and day +100 were 
recorded  continuously.  After  day  +100,  only  serious  AEs  with  suspected  relatedness  (SAR)  to  the  IP 
were documented up to visit 12 months after the HSCT. SARs were continuously assessed during the 
longer term follow up phase and results were reported. 
Acute (a) and chronic (c) GvHD: aGvHD was classified as GvHD up until 100 days after HSCT. Time to 
cGvHD was defined as the time between 100 days after end of HSCT and the first episode of cGvHD and 
evaluated  up  to  visit  12  months  after  HSCT.  cGvHD  episodes  were  continuously  assessed  during  the 
longer term follow up phase and results were reported. 
Clinical laboratory tests: The subject’s viral status was characterised by HIV, cytomegalovirus, Epstein 
Barr  virus  (EBV),  hepatitis  A,  B,  C,  and  herpes  tests  within  3  weeks  prior  to  day  -7.  Pregnancy  was 
assessed routinely in the subject’s urine or serum within 3 weeks prior to day -7, in any female who had 
experienced menarche. The standard laboratory parameters (total blood count, differential blood count, 
blood  chemistry,  and  the computed  GFR)  were documented  once  within  3  weeks  prior to Day  -7  and 
until visit Day +28, and on visit Day +100, if applicable. 
Vital signs, physical examinations: Blood pressure, pulse, height, weight, and body temperature were 
assessed between day -10 and day -8, and on visit Day 0, +28, +100, and on visit Month 6, 9, and 12. 
Lansky Performance Score (LPS), or Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) were assessed within 3 weeks 
prior to Day -7, and at visit Day 0, visit Day +28, visit Day +100, visit Month 6, 9, and 12.

Results 
SAFETY: 
1.  The  incidences  of  total  Treatment-emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs)  were  reported  by  97.1%  of 
subjects,  of  these  90%  of  subjects  reported  drug-related  TEAEs.  This  could  be  expected  with  an 
intensive treatment procedure as alloHSCT. 
TEAEs were most commonly reported in the System Organ Classes (SOCs) “Gastrointestinal disorders”, 
“General disorder and administration site conditions”, and “Infections and infestations” (TEAEs reported 
by 92.9%, 78.6%, and 71.4% of subjects, respectively). The most frequently reported AEs by preferred 
term (PT) were “Mucositis oral” (77.1%), “Fever” (72.9%), “Vomiting (68.6%), and Diarrhoea” (65.7%), 
as expected considering the nature of the drug. However, the frequent use of the intensified conditioning 
regimen  (65  out  of  70  subjects  received  additional  treatment  with  Thiotepa)  might  have  negatively 
affected this result.

disorders” and “Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders”). The most commonly reported TEAEs by 
PT  were  “Mucositis  oral”  (68.6%),  “Vomiting”  (41.4%),  “Nausea”  (32.9%),  and  “Diarrhoea” 
(28.6%).

•  TEAEs of at least CTCAE Grade III related to IP were reported by 48.6% of subjects. Such events 
were  only  reported  by  >  5%  of  subjects  for  4  SOCs:  “Gastrointestinal  disorders”  (42.9%  of 
subjects),  “Infections  and  infestations”  (7.1%),  “Skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders” 
(7.1%), and “Investigations” (5.7%) with “Mucositis oral” and “Nausea” as the most common 
Terms. The frequent use of the intensified conditioning regimen B (65 out of 70 subjects received 
additional  treatment  with  Thiotepa)  might  have  negatively  affected  this  result.  In  paediatric 
population,  “Mucosal  inflammation”  and  “Nausea”  are  very  common  ARs  considered  at  least 
possibly related to Thiotepa.

•  No unknown risks were identified in the trial. No suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions 
(SUSARs) occurred during the trial. 
•  At the end of the trial, 14 subjects out of the 70 registered subjects terminated the trial prematurely. 
Death was the predominant reason for premature termination for a total of 12 subjects (17.1%). The 
causes  of  these  deaths  were  relapse  /  progression  (8  subjects)  and  transplantation-related  (4 
subjects). Seven subjects (10.0%) died within 12 months after HSCT. Furthermore, 1 subject was 
lost to follow-up and 1 subject (1.4%) withdrew his/her consent from participating in the trial. The 
mean (standard deviation [SD]) time from transplantation to death was 14.97 (12.35) months. 
•  The  vital  signs  did  not  change  substantially  during  the  trial  with  an  exception  of  diastolic  blood 
pressure.  The  median  diastolic  blood  pressure  at  baseline  was  59.0  mmHg  (Q1  [25%-percentile] 
55.0, Q3 [75%-percentile] 67.0) with considerable variability (range from 43 to 81). At visit Month 
12, median change from baseline was 5.0 (Q1 2.0, Q3 11) mmHg (range from -23 to 34). 
•  A total of 7 subjects (12.1%) deteriorated to less than 60 points in the LPS and 2 subjects (16.7%) 
deteriorated to less than 60 points in the KPS. 
•  None of the subjects reported any lung toxicity (“Pulmonary Fibrosis”) during the trial. Only 1 subject 
reported an AE of HSOS Grade II (according to Jones et al). Hepatic toxicity of any grade (according 
to Bearmann) was reported by 34.3% of subjects. Infections of any CTCAE grade belonging to SOC 
“Infections and Infestations” were reported by 71.4% of subjects.

Safety in special populations 
Age of patients 
Age- and BSA-dependent pharmacokinetics of TREO in children was investigated in the PK sub-study of 
trials MC-FludT.16/NM and MC-FludT.17/M [Venn Life Sciences 2020]. With respect to the shape of the 
mean plasma concentration-time profiles of TREO and its monoepoxide metabolite, no major differences 
were observed between the age groups or BSA groups. However, a covariate analysis revealed that BSA 
was the only clinically relevant covariate for clearance and volumes of distribution. Therefore, patients 
with a BSA of < 1 m² received a lower dose of TREO in the clinical trials (≤ 0.5 m²: 10 g/m²; > 0.5 to 
1 m²: 12 g/m²; > 1 m²: full dose of 14 g/m²) to reach a similar exposure. 
A general trend to higher incidence of TEAEs was observed in patients receiving the highest dose group 
of TREO (14 g/m²) which refers also to the older patient group. Seizures were observed only in the 10 
g/m² dose group (n = 2 [8.7%]), i.e. the lowest age group (both children received the transplant for 
non-malignant diseases). Furthermore, there is a trend of higher incidence of severe TEAEs with higher 
doses  of  TREO  and  older  age  of  the  patients,  especially  with  respect  to  blood  and  lymphatic  system 
disorders (e.g. febrile neutropenia) and gastrointestinal disorders (e.g. stomatitis, nausea/vomiting).  
Age-dependent frequency of drug-related TEAEs was lower in the youngest age group. Influence of age 
on several toxicity parameters were also explored in paediatric patients within a registry study performed 
by the EBMT [Peters 2011].  
No significant correlation between age groups and the rate of grade III/IV aGvHD and extensive cGvHD, 
hyperbilirubinemia,  diarrhoea,  vomiting,  CNS  toxicity  or  peripheral  neurological  toxicity  was  found. 
However, considering all AE grades, more CNS toxicity was seen in the youngest age group. There was 
a  significant  increase  of  stomatitis  and  AST  elevation  grade  III/IV  with  age.  There  was  a  significant 
association  between  age  and  respiratory  toxicity.  Children  below  the  age  of  one  year  (mainly  non-
malignant diseases) experienced more respiratory grade III/IV toxicity. However, this could be explained 
by the fact that it is likely that these small children underwent HSCT for immunodeficiencies which are 
often associated with severe pulmonary infections even before HSCT. 
Gender of patients 
TEAEs  were  more  frequently  observed  in  female  patients  with  only  a  few  AEs  being  more  frequently 
observed in male patients (CMV infection, cough, chills, and peripheral oedema). The same is observed 
for the incidence of severe (≥ grade III) TEAEs which was slightly higher in female patients, especially 
with  respect  to  blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders  (17.1%  vs.  10.0%),  nervous  system  disorders 
(12.2% vs. 2.5%), gastrointestinal disorders (56.1% vs. 50.0%), and investigations (26.8% vs. 12.5%). 
With  respect  to  drug-related  TEAEs,  more  (> 5%  difference)  female  patients  experienced  vomiting 
(female vs. male: 48.8% vs. 38.8%), nausea (31.7% vs. 26.3%), abdominal pain (22.0% vs. 13.8%), 
hepatobiliary disorders (31.7% vs. 26.3%), increased ALT (14.6% vs. 8.8%), and increased AST (12.2% 
vs. 3.8%), whereas more male patients experienced infections (male vs. female: 15.0% vs. 4.9%), anal 
inflammation (5.0% vs. 0%), and general disorders (17.5% vs. 9.8%). 
Concomitant use of thiotepa in paediatric patients 
The majority of paediatric patients received the intensified regimen with thiotepa, which is associated 
with a trend of more TEAEs; however, the number of patients not receiving thiotepa is too small to draw 
final conclusions. TEAEs which have only been recorded in the thiotepa group (only those AEs considered 
with a frequency ≥ 5%) include viremia (n = 15 [13.9%]), EBV infection (10 [9.3%]), device-related 
infection  (10  [9.3]%),  adenovirus  infection  (8  [7.4%]),  sepsis  (7  [6.5%]),  febrile  neutropenia  (9

increased (12 [11.1%]). 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
As  per  the  SmPC,  no  interaction  of  treosulfan  was  observed  in  high  dose  chemotherapy.  Moreover, 
detailed  in  vitro  studies  did  not  completely  exclude  potential  interactions  between  high  plasma 
concentrations of treosulfan and CYP3A4, CYP2C19, or P-gp substrates. Therefore, medicinal products 
with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. digoxin) that are substrates for CYP3A4, CYP2C19 or P-gp should 
avoided during treatment with treosulfan. 
The effect of treosulfan on the pharmacokinetics of fludarabine is not known. 
No studies of specific drug-drug interactions were performed because TREO is given for three days only. 
No specific drug interaction could be identified within the clinical development programme. 
Gonadal toxicity 
Gonadal impairment is an important late effect with a significant impact on quality of life of transplanted 
patients.  Faraci  et  al.  [Faraci  2019]  compared  gonadal  function  after  BU-based  or  TREO-based 
conditioning regimens in pre- and postpubertal children. This retrospective, multicentre study included 
children  transplanted  in  paediatric  EBMT  centres  between  1992  and  2012  who  did  not  receive 
gonadotoxic chemoradiotherapy before the transplant. 137 patients transplanted in 25 paediatric EBMT 
centres were evaluated. Median age at transplant was 11.04 years (range, 5 to 18); 89 patients were 
boys and 48 girls. Eighty-nine patients were prepubertal at transplant and 48 postpubertal. One hundred 
eighteen  children  received  BU  and  19  TREO.  A  higher  proportion  of  girls  treated  with  TREO  in  the 
prepubertal  stage  reached  spontaneous  puberty  compared  with  those  treated  with  BU  (P = 0.02). 
Spontaneous menarche was more frequent after TREO than after BU (P < 0.001). Postpubertal boys and 
girls  treated  with  TREO  had  significantly  lower  luteinizing  hormone  levels  (P = 0.03  and  P = 0.04, 
respectively) compared with the BU group. This study suggests that the frequency of gonadal damage 
associated with TREO is significantly lower than that observed after BU. 
Although this is a small study where very few TREO-based treated patients were included (19) versus 
BU-based  treated  patients  (118),  this  observation  is  corroborated  by  data  from  a  more  recent  study 
[Leiper  2020]  where  the  fertility  in  121  survivors  of  all  ages  of  myeloid  leukaemia  and  other 
haematological and immunodeficiency disorders who have undergone HSCT after three chemotherapy-
conditioning  regimens  of  different  intensity  which  included  TREO-based  (25  males  and  16  females), 
BU/cyclophosphamide  (BU/Cy)  (32  males  and  23  females)  and  Fludarabine/melphalan  (Flu-Mel)  (13 
males and 12 females) containing regimens was assessed by measuring serum concentrations of Anti-
Müllerian  hormone  (AMH)  and  Inhibin  B.  Normal  age-matched  control  data  were  used  to  convert  the 
measurements  of  AMH  and  lnhibin  B  to  standard  deviation  scores  (SDS).  The  AMH  data  obtained 
suggested less ovarian reserve impairment after TREO and Flu-Mel than after Bu-Cy and the mean serum 
AMH concentration was significantly better with treosulfan (>1.0 μg/l) than with Flu-Mel or Bu-Cy. The 
same more favourable trend for TREO-based conditioning regimen is seen in males regarding Inhibin B 
data with the Flu-Mel group suffering greatest impairment. These authors reach the same conclusion, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/117245/2023  
Page 162/183 
 
 
 
that a TREO-based regimen confers a more favourable gonadal compromise than Flu-Mel or Bu-Cy in 
both sexes.  
Gonadal  toxicity  was  investigated  in  one  pre-clinical  study  [Levi  2018]  that  concludes  that  treosulfan 
induces  distinctive  gonadal  toxicity  compared  with  busulfan.  The  rationale  for  this  study  was  the 
knowledge that busulfan is considered highly gonadotoxic but the gonadal toxicity profile of treosulfan 
was not yet clear. In this pre-clinical study, pubertal and prepubertal male and female mice were injected 
with treosulfan or busulfan and sacrificed one week, one month or six months later. The assessment of 
testicular  and  ovarian  functions  indicated  that  treosulfan  testicular  toxicity  was  milder  than  that  of 
busulfan toxicity and the ovarian toxicity of both treosulfan and busulfan was severe and permanent. 
In  the  RMP,  impaired  fertility  (male/female)  is  recognized  as  not  yet  reported  in  clinical  studies  and 
therefore classified within the safety concerns list as a missing information with the need for long-term 
follow up data after TREO-based conditioning (especially in paediatric patients)..  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
There were no events that led to a substantial intervention (premature discontinuation of study drug, 
dose reduction, or substantial additional concomitant therapy) in both studies.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
 All seven trials also provide important safety data for the use of TREO. In total, the submitted data 
package includes safety data from 613 adult patients and 121 paediatric patients who have been treated 
with TREO-based conditioning. 
Considering  the  aim  of  the  current  variation  the  discussion  of  clinical  safety  is  focused  in  the  two 
paediatric clinical trials MC-FludT.16/NM and MC-FludT.17/M. 
The  most  commonly  reported  undesirable  effects  of  TREO  are  myelosuppression  (leukocytopenia, 
thrombocytopenia, anaemia) and gastrointestinal complaints (nausea, vomiting). They are usually mild 
and resolve after treatment.  
Bone  marrow  suppression  (neutropenia,  leukocytopenia,  thrombocytopenia,  anaemia)  is  the  dose-
limiting  side  effect  of  TREO.  However,  it  is  this  toxicity  that  supported  the  development  of  TREO  for 
conditioning  treatment  prior  to  HSCT,  especially  in  the  allogenic  setting.  For  this  indication,  TREO  is 
always combined with FLU. Most paediatric patients receive additionally thiotepa (TT). This conditioning 
regimen is followed by infusion of haematopoietic stem cells. 
Bone  marrow  depression  and  immunosuppression  are  therefore  desired  therapeutic  effects  of  the 
conditioning  regimen  and  consequently  cannot  be  considered  as  undesirable  effects.  Therefore,  any 
changes in blood counts and differential blood counts occurring between Day -6 and Day +28 were not 
documented  as  AEs.  Especially  during  the  time  of  bone  marrow  aplasia  induced  by  the  conditioning 
regimen, infections may develop and are a major source of morbidity and mortality of patients.  
Facing  the  above,  the  adverse  events  (AEs)  and  adverse  reactions  (ARs)  observed  with  TREO-based 
conditioning  followed  by  alloHSCT  are  not  only  due  to  TREO  alone  but  relate  to  the  whole  complex 
treatment procedure of alloHSCT. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/117245/2023  
Page 163/183 
 
 
 
A total 121 paediatric patients have been treated with TREO-based conditioning, including 51 patients 
with  non-malignant  diseases  (primary  immunodeficiency,  haemoglobinopathy,  inborn  error  of 
metabolism and bone marrow failure syndromes) and 70 patients with malignant diseases (AML, ALL, 
MDS, and JMML).  
The study in non-malignant diseases (MC-FludT.16/NM) also included an active-control group with 50 
evaluable patients treated with the reference conditioning regimen BU/FLU ± TT. 
This safety data set is supplemented by safety data derived from two registry studies of the EBMT [Peters 
201193;  Peters  2017]  which  included  a  total  of  1  521  paediatric  patients  with  malignant  and  non-
malignant diseases who had been treated with TREO-based conditioning. Therefore, available safety data 
cover all paediatric patients which are currently treated with alloHSCT. 
Two  comparisons  can  be  made  based  on  the  safety  data  submitted:  a)  a  comparison  of  the  safety 
between treosulfan- and busulfan-based conditioning regimens prior HSCT in paediatric patients with 
non-malignant  diseases  as  gathered  within  the  MC-FludT.16/NM  trial;  b)  and  a  comparison  of  the 
safety  of  the  treosulfan-based  conditioning  regime prior  HSCT  between  paediatric  patients  with non-
malignant diseases (from MC-FludT.16/NM) and with malignant diseases as gathered within the 
MC-FludT.17/M. 
a)  From the data gathered in patients with non-malignant diseases it is possible to observe that 
frequency of TEAEs, including TEAEs with at least CTCAE grade III TEAEs, was broadly similar in 
the 2 treatment arms with some exceptions. The TREO group showed higher frequency of TEAEs 
including drug-related TEAEs, with differences ≥ 10%, for diarrhoea, abdominal pain, maculo-
papular rash and pruritus but lower frequency for lung infection, dry skin, oral mucositis, nausea 
and hepatobiliary disorders; Higher frequency, with differences ≥ 5%, was observed with TREO 
for  infections,  febrile  neutropenia  and  vascular  events  but  lower  frequency  for  vomiting  and 
respiratory disorders. The frequency of gonadal damage and HSOS associated with TREO was 
lower than that observed after BU. 
Frequency of SAEs was also comparable in both groups of trial MC-FludT.16/NM however the TREO group 
of subjects experienced less life-threatening SAEs and SAEs resulting in death as well as drug-related 
SAEs  than  the  BU  group  but  more  SAEs,  such  as  infections  and  more  general  disorders  (fever)  and 
conditions that required hospitalisation or prolongation of hospitalisation. This was confirmed by data 
from  EBMT  registry.  The  most  common  causes  of  death  after  HSCT  for  non-malignant  diseases  were 
infection, graft versus host disease, the original disease and transplant associated organ complications. 
Cumulative incidence of aGvHD of all grades as well as of grade III/IV was higher for the TREO group 
up to Day +100 of the HSCT but on the contrary the cumulative incidence of cGvHD was higher in the 
BU arm 
Laboratory  parameters  were  largely  comparable  for  the  2  treatment  arms  throughout  the  trial.  The 
durations of leukopenia and neutropenia were significantly longer in the treosulfan arm than the busulfan 
arm.  In  trial  MC-FludT.16/NM,  the  median  level  of  WBCs  at  baseline,  incidence  of  increased 
bilirubin/ALT/AST and median change levels from baseline of electrolytes (sodium, potassium) had no 
significant differences between both treatment groups. The same is largely verified for vital signs. The 
Kaplan  Meier  estimate  at  12  months  for  subjects  showing  a  deterioration  to  less  than  60  points  was 
slightly more favourable for the TREO group (8.3%) than for the BU group (12.7%). 
b)  When comparing the use of TREO prior HSCT in paediatric patients with malignant and non-
malignant diseases similar rate of AEs of any CTCAE grade and drug-related ADRs of at least 
CTCAE Grade III was seen although the rate of AEs of at least CTCAE Grade III was somewhat 
lower (difference <5%) and the drug-related ADRS of any CTCAE grade (difference >5%) higher 
Assessment report

in the case of patients with malignant diseases. Patients with at least one SAE were comparable 
between the two classes of diseases when treated with TREO, with life-threatening AEs slightly 
more associated with the treatment of malignant diseases (difference <5%). Subjects with non-
malignant disease also presented slightly higher drug-related SAE (3.9% vs 1.4%). 
It is possible to see that more patients (> 5% difference) with malignant diseases experienced viremia, 
device-related infection, hypersensitivity reactions, hypokalaemia, psychiatric disorders, nausea, bone 
pain,  positive  viral  test,  and  increased  blood  bilirubin  while  epistaxis,  abdominal  pain,  hepatoxicity, 
puritus, alopecia, increased CRP and infusion-related reactions were found in patients transplanted for 
non-malignant diseases. 
Number of death cases were considerable higher in the trial MC-FludT.17/M (17.1%, n=12) than in the 
TREO arm of the MC-FludT.16/NM (3.9%, n=2) being largely due to relapse/progression in the case of 
the former trial. However, the mean time from transplantation to death was longer for the patients with 
malignant diseases treated with TREO than for the patients with non-malignant (14.97 months vs 5.75 
months). Incidences of hepatic toxicity and infections were higher (but no significant) for the patients 
with malignant diseases than for patients with non-malignant diseases. Results were comparable in both 
trials regarding the frequency of SAEs. 
Incidences  of  aGvHD  were  slightly  higher  in  patients  with  non-malignant  diseases  (54.9%)  than  with 
malignant diseases (43.5%). However, for malignant diseases, there was a borderline significant impact 
of age-group on the incidence of aGvHD of any grade (P = 0.045). Mainly in non-malignant diseases 
children below the age of one year experienced more respiratory grade III/IV toxicity, which could be 
explained by the fact that it is likely these small children usually underwent HSCT for immunodeficiencies, 
that are often associated with severe pulmonary infections even before HSCT. Also, for non-malignant 
diseases, EBMT registry studies data indicate that there is no significant association between grade III/IV 
toxicity  and  dose-group  in  the  subgroups  of  patients  according  to  donor  type,  and  diagnoses  [Peters 
2011]. Cumulative incidence of cGvHD is maintained over time for patients with both malignant and non-
malignant diseases and was considerably higher (difference >10%) when TREO is used in the patients 
with malignant diseases. The same (although with a difference >5%) was observed for the cumulative 
incidence  of  moderate/severe  cGvHD.  The  overall  Kaplan  Meier  estimate  at  12  months  for  subjects 
showing a deterioration to less than 60 points was higher for patients with malignant diseases (13.6%) 
than with non-malignant diseases (8.3%). Acute GvHD Grade III-IV was reported in less than 9% of the 
subjects and was maintained at 100 days. Also, for chronic GvHD cumulative incidence did not change 
up to the end of the duration of the trial’s follow-up, i.e. 36 months. 
The MAH proposes to amend an existing warning on section 4.4 of the SmPC and corresponding section 
of PL on skin toxicity based on new literature data. In a recent publication from Even-Or et al. 2020  1 
regarding  skin  toxicities  following  TREO-thiotepa-FLU-based  conditioning  regimen  in  non-malignant 
paediatric  patients,  an  increase  of  skin  disorders  was  observed  when  patients  received  sodium 
bicarbonate-containing  hydration  in  the  course  of  TREO  infusion.  The  MAH  postulated  that  this  effect 
could be due to the acceleration of the pH-dependent formation of alkylating epoxides. The effect may 
be prevented by keeping the skin clean and dry on days of treosulfan infusion. Rash and dermatitis are 
given  as  examples  of  such  skin  toxicities.  The  MAH  specified  the  exact  ADRs  and  their  severity  (see 
SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
With the responses to the second request for supplementary information comparative results on graft 
failures in line with the final Clinical Trial Report of the MCFludT.16/NM trial were reintroduced in section 
5.1 of the SmPC.

2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
As  expected  considering  the  target  indication  of  intensive  treatment  conditioning-based  treatment  in 
paediatric  population  with  malignant  diseases  prior alloHSCT  and  confirming  the  previous  safety  data 
almost all subjects treated with treosulfan in this disease setting presented TEAEs (68/70). Likewise, the 
combination treatment with Thiotepa in the majority of the subjects (65/70) also explains the frequency 
of TEAEs and TEAEs of at least CTCAE grade III related or not with the drug. These adverse events are 
already included in section 4.8 of the SmPC related with paediatric population. Among the TESAEs, upper 
respiratory infection and febrile neutropenia are reported, the former is not clearly included in SmPC and 
the  latter  is  included  with  unknown  frequency.  No  unknown  risks  were  identified  and  there  was  no 
occurrence  of  any  SUSARs.  At  the  end  of  the  trial  where  treosulfan  was  included  in  the  conditioning 
regime  for  patients  with  malignant  diseases,  20%  subjects  (n=14)  terminated  the  trial  prematurely, 
being  death  from  relapse/progression  and  transplantation-related  the  main  cause  in  17.1%  of  the 
subjects (n=12). Laboratory parameters and vital signs did not change and performance scores were as 
expected.  
Overall, safety data gathered from the MU-FludT.17/M trial is in line with the adverse reactions listed for 
adults and paediatric patients already included in the approved PI and can be explained by the intensive 
treatment  prior  alloHSCT  of  treosulfan  on  top  of  standardized  fludarabine,  and  in  the  majority  of  the 
cases also with thiotepa, as well due to the underlying malignant disease (ALL, AML, MDS, and JMML) 
and transplantation-procedure per se. The safety profile is comparable to those reported for treosulfan 
in other trials and comparable or even favourable to those reported for BU- or TBI-based conditioning 
regimens. 
No unknown risks were identified in the trial and there was no occurrence of any SUSARs. Comparable 
incidences of aGvHD were observed between the treatment arms however a significantly and clinically 
meaningful  lower  incidence  of  overall  cGvHD  was  found  with  treosulfan.  More  deaths  occurred  in  the 
busulfan  arm  than  the  treosulfan  arm.  Overall,  safety  results  favour  the  treatment  with  treosulfan  in 
comparison with busulfan in for conditioning prior to alloHSCT in paediatric patients with non-malignant 
diseases.   
An existing warning on section 4.4 of the SmPC and corresponding section of PL on skin toxicity (e.g. 
rash, dermatitis) was revised based on new literature data.   
Further safety data will be provided as the MAH agreed to a CHMP recommendation to submit the final 
study report of study MC-FludT.16/NM when available.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have 
been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
-this new indication does not introduce any major amendments to the Package Leaflet which affects the 
readability and requires to conduct a new user test. The introduced changes are the new indication, the 
amendment of an existing warning on skin toxicity based on new literature data and the update of side 
effects, being the majority of the changes related to rearrangements in terms of frequency, only a few

new effects were introduced. This does not impact the readability already tested for this PL. 
-The package leaflet included in this submission is in general, identical to the previously readability 
tested package leaflet. During the initial marketing authorisation application, the MAH has performed a 
full user testing that has successfully demonstrated the comprehensibility and usability of the PL. This 
conclusion can be extended to the PL submitted as part of this proposed extension of the therapeutic 
indication. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Conditioning treatment prior to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) to treat 
paediatric patients older than one month with malignant and non-malignant diseases. 
Treosulfan is approved for the conditioning treatment prior to alloHSCT in malignant and non-malignant 
diseases  in  adult  and  in  malignant  diseases  in  paediatric  patients.  The  MAH  intends  to  extend  the 
approved indication also to paediatric patients with non-malignant indications. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
AlloHSCT  is  the  only  potentially  curative  treatment  option  for  many  patients  especially  with  AML  and 
MDS, relapsed patients with various other haematological malignancies, as well as some non-malignant 
disorders  (NMD)  such  as  primary 
immunodeficiencies  (PID), 
inborn  errors  of  metabolism, 
haemoglobinopathies or bone marrow failure syndromes. The most common indications for an alloHSCT 
are AML (40.8%), followed by MDS/MPS (15.7%), and ALL (15.4%) and NMD (13.2%). Main indications 
for alloHSCT in children are ALL, AML and NMD [Passweg 2021]. 
An  increasing  number  of  children  with  non-malignant  diseases  can  be  cured  by  alloHSCT.  There  is  a 
number  of  conditioning  regimens  that  can  be  used  in  this  treatment.  Treosulfan  (TREO)-based 
conditioning regimens is  one of them [Slatter 2015; Peters 201794], although the use is not approved 
in the EU being the target of the application for the extension of indication under assessment. 
The various conditioning regimens prior alloHSCT used in clinical practice today differ in their intensity 
and  are  currently  divided  into  three  categories:  myeloablative  conditioning  (MAC),  reduced  intensity 
conditioning  (RIC)  and  non-myeloablative  conditioning  (NMA).  Myeloablative  conditioning  regimens 
cause  irreversible  cytopenia  and  Haematopoietic  stem  cells  (HSC)  support  is  mandatory.  Non-
myeloablative  conditioning  regimens  cause  minimal  cytopenia  and  can  be  given  also  without  HSC 
support.  Reduced  intensity  conditioning  regimens  do  not  fit  criteria  for  MAC  or  NMA  regimens.  They 
cause cytopenia of variable duration and should be given with stem cell support, although cytopenia may 
not be irreversible [Bacigalupo 2009]. The most frequently used medicinal products used for conditioning 
treatment  include  oral  or  preferably  intravenous  Busulfan  (BU),  Cyclophosphamide  (CY),  Melphalan 
(MEL),  Thiotepa  (TT),  Fludarabine  (FLU),  cytarabine,  amsacrine,  and  increasingly  TREO.  Total  body

irradiation (TBI) has been included in some of the regimens to further reduce relapse incidence; however, 
it causes substantial toxicity. 
In paediatric patients, various conditioning regimens are used depending on the disease (malignant or 
non-malignant), disease status, as well as institute-specific preferences. Reduced intensity conditioning 
regimens  are  much  less  frequently  used  than  in  adults  because  children  less  frequently  have 
comorbidities which do not allow using a MAC regimen. In addition, children with non-malignant diseases 
like  haemoglobinopathies  or  metabolic  disorders  require  an  intensive,  myeloablative  conditioning 
treatment  to  ensure  a  successful  engraftment.  In  recent  years,  thiotepa  has  been  increasingly 
incorporated into conditioning regimens for malignant as well as non-malignant diseases [Peters 2017]. 
Transplant-related morbidity/mortality limits the use of alloHSCT for many patients. The mortality rate 
at 100 days post alloHSCT ranges between 7% for patients with acute leukaemia in remission undergoing 
matched related donor (MRD) HSCT and 27% for patients with refractory acute leukaemia undergoing 
matched unrelated donor (MUD) HSCT [Pasquini 2014].  
There is a high unmet medical need for new conditioning regimens with low treatment-related toxicities 
but no increased risk for relapse to improve the OS and ensure a good quality of life for the patients. 
Such  a  regimen  should  offer  sufficient  stem  cell  toxicity,  immunosuppressive potential  and  high  anti-
tumour activity (in case of malignant disorders), but reduced organ toxicity (especially with respect to 
the  liver,  kidneys,  lung,  and  the  nervous  system)  and  predictive  pharmacokinetics.  With  the  current 
application, treosulfan in meant to replace busulfan in the conditioning prior alloHSCT in patients with 
non-malignant diseases with similar clinical results and less toxicity as in adults. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Treosulfan-based conditioning regimens followed by alloHSCT have been investigated by the MAH in a 
total  of  613  adult  and  121  paediatric  patients  within  seven  clinical  trials.  According  to  the  Paediatric 
Investigation  Plan  (PIP),  two  clinical  transplantation  studies  with  TREO-based  conditioning  were 
conducted in paediatric patient populations [Table 3].  
The final clinical study report (CSR) of MC-FludT.17/M (Version 2, dated 24-Mar-2020) includes longer-
term follow-up results until 36 months after transplant. The CSR of study MC-FludT.16/NM focusses 
on completed 12 month follow-up data for all subjects, but also contains follow-up data available as of 
the  data  cut-off  on  07-Jun-2021.  Longer-term  follow-up  data  will  be  collected  until  the  last  recruited 
subject has completed visit Month 36 and presented in an updated version of the CSR expected in 2023. 
Both studies are based on an approved PIP, incl. four agreed modifications.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
 In paediatric patients, a conditioning regimen consisting of 10-14 g/m²/d × 3 TREO (Day -6/-5/-4) plus 
fludarabine  (FT10-14)  proved  to  be  very  effective  and  well  tolerated  in  MC-FludT.17/M  and  MC-
FludT.16/NM  clinical  trials  that  included  a  total  of  121  patients  with,  respectively,  malignant  or  non-
malignant  disorders.  In  the  latter  clinical  trial,  a  comparison  of  the  TREO/FLU/±TT  regime  with  a 
BU/FLU/±TT regime is performed after randomisation of 1:1 of 101 patients (51:50). Most of the patients 
(89%) received a regimen of FT10-14 combined with thiotepa (FT10-14/TT).  
Furthermore, data of TREO-based conditioning are available from the EBMT registry for a total of 1 416 
patients  which  confirm  its  efficacy  and  safety  for  malignant  as  well  as  non-malignant  transplant 
indications [Peters 2011/2017]. 
The main favourable effects of the use of TREO and in particularly when comparing with BU are:  
•  High cumulative engraftment rate, with a maximum conditional cumulative incidence of neutrophil 
engraftment of 97.3% in paediatric patients with non-malignant diseases (study 16/NM) and 100% 
in paediatric patients with malignant diseases (study MC-FludT.17/M). This is also concordant with 
the higher (3.9% for TREO and 4.0% for BU) primary graft failure rates observed for in patients 
with non-malignant diseases when compared with patients with malignant diseases (0) and higher 
secondary graft failure for the TREO arm of the study 16/NM (18.4%). According to the 2017 EBMT 
meta-analysis  in  paediatric  patients  with  non-malignant  diseases,  neutrophil  engraftment  at  Day 
100 after alloHSCT was superior with the TREO/FLU/TT combination versus BU/FLU/TT (96.1% vs. 
83.5%) [Peters 201794].  
• 
Lower freedom from transplant (treatment) related mortality until Day +100 after HSCT: both TREO 
and  BU  give  good  results  but  the  treosulfan  behaves  better  with  100%  (.16/NM;  90%  CI:  94.3, 
100) or 98.6% subjects (MC-FludT.17/M; 90% CI: 93.4, 99.9) without an event for treosulfan vs 
90% for busulfan /90% CI: 80.1, 96.0)(unadjusted p-value 0.0267; adjusted p-value 0.0528). 
• 
Lower transplant-related mortality: TREO-based conditioning was at 1 year very low in patients with 
both non-malignant (3.9%; 90% CI: 1.2, 12.0) as well as malignant diseases (1.4%; 90% CI: 0.3, 
7.2%) and lower than with BU in no-malignant diseases (12.0%; 90% CI: 6.3, 22.1) (HR (TREO/BU) 
0.29 (90% CI 0.0, 1.09); p value 0.1244). This was also seen in the EBMT registry analysis with no 
influence  of  age  or  dose  of  treosulfan  and  significantly  lower  TRM  for  TREO/FLU/TT  than  for 
BU/FLU/TT conditioning [Peters 2017]. In both treatments for non-malignant diseases the TRM was 
maintained over time (only a slight increase between 2 and 3 years for BU arm) however after to 2 
years in malignant disease with treosulfan. TRM after TREO-based conditioning was also very low 
in the EBMT registry analysis. TREO dosing in the paediatric studies aimed to reach TREO plasma 
levels in the range observed with the 14 g/m² dose in adults. The data from both studies suggest 
that paediatric patients tolerate TREO-based conditioning better than adult patients and justify that 
there was no need to reduce the TREO dose in this patient population. 
•  Higher disease-free survival in patients with non-malignant diseases: Disease-free survival (DFS) 
at one year in paediatric patients with non-malignant diseases was highest with the TREO/FLU/TT 
regimen (86%). This was significantly higher than the 77.3% DFS rate observed with the BU/FLU/TT 
regimen (P = 0.002) [Peters 2017]. However, event-free survival was lower for TREO arm in study 
16/NM  than  for  BU  at  all  time  points  but  comparable  between  non-malignant  and  malignant 
diseases. 
•  Higher overall survival rate in patients with non-malignant diseases: In study 16/NM OS rate at 1 
year after TREO-based conditioning was 96.1% (90% CI: 88.0, 98.8%), higher than for BU with an 
OS value of 88.0% (90% CI:77.9,93.7) than for malignant diseases with an OS of 91.4% (90% CI: 
83.9, 95.5). This OS rate was maintained at 3 years for TREO in non-malignant diseases, decreased 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/117245/2023  
Page 171/183 
 
 
 
to 84.0% (90% CI: 71.4, 91.4) for BU and for TREO in malignant diseases to 84.3% (90% CI: 75.5, 
90.1). These data are confirmed by data from the EBMT registry.  
• 
Low  relapse  rate:  The  conditional  cumulative  incidence  of  relapse/progression  in  the  70  patients 
treated with TREO-based conditioning in trial MC-FludT.17/M was 15.7% at 12 months and 23.0% 
at  24/36  months  with  15.7%  (n=11)  of  these  patients  requiring  rescue  therapy  mainly  of  donor 
lymphocyte  infusion  (DLI)  or  stem  cell  boost.  According  to  the  EBMT  registry  [Peters  2017], 
incidence of disease relapse at 1 year after transplant is also very low in patients with non-malignant 
diseases  and  ranged  from  6.1-6.8%  with  TREO-based  conditioning  to  7.2-9%  with  BU-based 
conditioning. The no difference regarding rescue therapies between TREO and BU is confirmed in 
the  16/NM  trial.  However,  in  study  16/NM,  patients  with  non-malignant  diseases  required  more 
rescue  therapies  (41.2%;  especially  transfusions  for  RBCs  [33%]  and  platelets  [27.5%])  than 
patients with malignant diseases in study MC-FludT.17/M.  
• 
Lower  gonadal  toxicity:  Results  from  two  clinical  [Faraci  2019;  Leiper  2020]  and  one  preclinical 
study [Levi 2018] suggest that the gonadal toxicity is lower with TREO compared to BU. 
Good engraftment with lower freedom from transplant (treatment) related mortality until Day +100 after 
HSCT, lower transplant-related mortality, better overall survival as compared to busulfan. 
Based on the engraftment and chimerism data approaching 100% and > 90%, respectively, efficacy 
parameters like EFS, OS, and GvHD-free and relapse-free survival confirm the effectiveness of this 
conditioning treatment not only in preparing for alloHSCT paediatric patients with malignant diseases 
but also in intended extension of the indication, i.e. non-malignant diseases as for adults. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Long term data on efficacy will be provided as the final study report of study MC-FludT.16/NM will be 
submitted  when  available.  This  is  of  interest  as  allo-HSCT  will  be  applied  in  the  treatment  for  non-
malignant diseases with the expectation of long-term treatment benefit. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The  most  commonly  reported  undesirable  effects  of  TREO  are  myelosuppression  (leukocytopenia, 
thrombocytopenia, anaemia), immunosuppression, and gastrointestinal complaints (nausea, vomiting). 
They  are  usually  mild  and  resolve  after  treatment.  In  fact,  it  is  this  toxicity  that  supported  the 
development of TREO for conditioning treatment prior to HSCT, especially in the allogenic setting. Bone 
marrow  depression  and  immunosuppression  are  therefore  the  desired  therapeutic  effects  of  a 
conditioning regimen. 
The study in non-malignant diseases (MC-FludT.16/NM) also included an active-control group with 50 
evaluable patients treated with the reference conditioning regimen BU/FLU ± TT. 
This safety data set is supplemented by safety data derived from two registry studies of the EBMT [Peters 
201193;  Peters  2017]  which  included  a  total  of  1  521  paediatric  patients  with  malignant  and  non-
malignant diseases who had been treated with TREO-based conditioning. Therefore, available safety data 
cover all paediatric patients which are currently treated with alloHSCT. 
Two  comparisons  can  be made  based  on  the unfavourable  effects based on the  data  submitted:  a) a 
comparison between the effects with treosulfan- and busulfan-based conditioning regimens prior HSCT 
in paediatric patients with non-malignant diseases as gathered within the MC-FludT.16/NM trial; b) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/117245/2023  
Page 172/183 
 
 
 
 
and  a  comparison  of  the  effects  of  the  treosulfan-based  conditioning  regime  prior  HSCT  between 
paediatric  patients  with  non-malignant  diseases  (from  MC-FludT.16/NM)  and  with  malignant 
diseases as gathered within the MC-FludT.17/M. 
The most common causes of death after HSCT for non-malignant diseases were infection, graft versus 
host disease, the original disease and transplant associated organ complications. 
From  the  data  gathered  in  patients  with  non-malignant  diseases  it  is  possible  to  observe  that 
frequency of TEAEs, including TEAEs with at least CTCAE grade III TEAEs, and frequency of SAEs was 
broadly  similar  in  the  two  treatment  arms  with  the  exceptions  depicted  below.  Also,  laboratory 
parameters  were  largely  comparable  for  the  2  treatment  arms  throughout  the  trial.  In  trial  MC-
FludT.16/NM, the median level of WBCs at baseline, incidence of increased bilirubin/ALT/AST and median 
change levels from baseline of electrolytes (sodium, potassium) had no significant differences between 
both treatment groups. The same is largely verified for vital signs. 
Higher rate of unfavourable effects is seen with TREO-based conditioning treatment prior allo-HSCT in 
non-malignant  diseases  when  comparing  with  BU-based  treatment:  The  TREO  group  showed  higher 
frequency  of  TEAEs  including  drug-related  TEAEs,  with  differences  ≥  10%,  for  diarrhoea,  abdominal 
pain, maculo-papular rash and pruritus; Higher frequency, with differences ≥ 5%, was observed with 
TREO  for  infections,  febrile  neutropenia  and  vascular  events  but  lower  frequency  for  vomiting  and 
respiratory disorders. The TREO group of subjects experienced more SAEs, such as infections and more 
general disorders (fever) and conditions that required hospitalisation or prolongation of hospitalisation 
than the BU group. Cumulative incidence of aGvHD of all grades as well as of grade III/IV was higher 
for  the  TREO  group up  to Day  +100  of  the  HSCT.  The  durations of  leukopenia  and  neutropenia  were 
significantly  longer  in  the  TREO  arm  than  the  BU  arm  but  the  MAH  clarified  the  potential  factors 
associated with these events (see above Section 8.3). 
Lower rate of unfavourable effects is seen with TREO-based conditioning treatment prior allo-HSCT in 
non-malignant  diseases  when  comparing  with  BU-based  treatment:  The  TREO  group  showed  lower 
frequency of TEAEs including drug-related TEAEs, with differences ≥ 10%, for lung infection, dry skin, 
oral mucositis, nausea and hepatobiliary disorders. The TREO group of subjects experienced less life-
threatening  SAEs  and  SAEs  resulting  in  death  as  well  as  drug-related  SAEs  than  the  BU  group. 
Cumulative incidence of cGvHD was higher in the BU arm. The Kaplan Meier estimate at 12 months for 
subjects showing a deterioration to less than 60 points was slightly more favourable for the TREO group 
(8.3%) than for the BU group (12.7%). 
When comparing the use of TREO prior HSCT in paediatric patients with malignant and non-malignant 
diseases similar rate of AEs of any CTCAE grade and drug-related ADRs of at least CTCAE Grade III was 
seen. Results were comparable in both trials when treated with TREO regarding the frequency of SAEs 
and the % of patients with at least one SAE. Some exceptions are listed below: 
Higher rate of unfavourable effects is seen with TREO-based conditioning treatment prior alloHSCT in 
non-malignant diseases when comparing malignant diseases: the rate of AEs of at least CTCAE Grade 
III  was  somewhat  higher  (difference  <5%)  when  comparing  with  patients  with  malignant  diseases. 
Subjects with non-malignant disease also presented slightly higher drug-related SAE (3.9% vs 1.4%). 
The mean time from transplantation to death was shorter for the patients with non-malignant diseases 
treated with TREO than for the patients with malignant (5.75 months vs 14.97 months). Incidences of 
aGvHD  were  slightly  higher  in  patients  with  non-malignant  diseases  (54.9%)  than  with  malignant 
diseases  (43.5%).  In  non-malignant  diseases  children  below  the  age  of  one  year  experienced  more 
respiratory grade III/IV toxicity 
Lower  rate  of  unfavourable  effects  is  seen  with  TREO-based  conditioning  treatment  prior  alloHSCT  in 
non-malignant diseases when comparing malignant diseases: the drug-related ADRS of any CTCAE grade

(difference >5%) was lower than in the case of patients with malignant diseases. Life-threatening AEs 
slightly more associated with the treatment of malignant diseases (difference <5%). More patients (> 
5% difference) with malignant diseases experienced viremia, device-related infection, hypersensitivity 
reactions,  hypokalaemia,  psychiatric  disorders,  nausea,  bone  pain,  positive  viral  test,  and  increased 
blood  bilirubin  while  epistaxis,  abdominal  pain,  hepatoxicity,  puritus,  alopecia,  increased  CRP  and 
infusion-related reactions were found in patients transplanted for non-malignant diseases. Number of 
death cases were considerable higher in the trial MC-FludT.17/M (17.1%, n=12) than in the TREO arm 
of the MC-FludT.16/NM (3.9%, n=2) being largely due to relapse/progression in the case of the former 
trial. Incidences of hepatic toxicity and infections were lower (but no significant) for the patients with 
non-malignant  diseases  than  for  patients  with  malignant  diseases.  Cumulative  incidence  of  cGvHD  is 
maintained over time for patients with both malignant and non-malignant diseases but was considerably 
higher  (difference  >10%)  when  TREO  is  used  in  the  patients  with  malignant  diseases.  The  same 
(although with a difference >5%) was observed for the cumulative incidence of moderate/severe cGvHD. 
The  overall  Kaplan  Meier estimate  at  12  months  for  subjects  showing  a  deterioration  to  less  than  60 
points  was  lower  for  patients  with  non-malignant  diseases  (8.3%)  than  with  non-malignant  diseases 
(13.6%). 
Based on new literature data (Even-Or et al. 2020 1), the MAH proposes to amend an existing warning 
on section 4.4 of the SmPC and corresponding section of PL on skin toxicity following TREO-thiotepa-
FLU-based conditioning regimen in non-malignant paediatric patients, when patients received sodium 
bicarbonate-containing hydration in the course of TREO infusion. In the response provided to the first 
request for supplementary information, the MAH reevaluated the issue on skin toxicity to specify the 
exact related ADRs and their severity. From the literature consulted no clear relation between skin 
toxicity and sodium bicarbonate-containing hydration could be found and only reports from clinical 
practice support the proposed change to the SmPC. Without being able to obtain detailed information 
the MAH concluded that further investigation is needed so that this issue can be detailed in the SmPC. 
As such, the MAH proposes to withdraw the proposed amendment to the existing warning on section 
4.4 of the SmPC and corresponding PL and leave the texts has previously approved. This is acceptable, 
especially considering the commitment of the MAH to collect additional information within signal 
management to allow a proper evaluation of the issue of skin toxicity and the submission of a future 
variation if applicable. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The MAH proposes to amend an existing warning on skin toxicity based on new literature data. Rash 
and dermatitis are given as examples of such skin toxicities. In the first round of the assessment the 
MAH was asked to specify the exact ADRs and their severity and if applicable to update the Product 
Information accordingly. From the literature consulted no clear relation between skin toxicity and 
sodium bicarbonate-containing hydration could be found and only reports from clinical practice support 
the proposed change. Without being able to obtain detailed information the MAH concluded that further 
investigation is needed so that this issue can be detailed in the SmPC.  
Long term data on safety in the treatment for non-malignant diseases -with the expectation of long-
term treatment benefit - will be provided as the MAH agreed to a CHMP recommendation to submit the 
final study report of study MC-FludT.16/NM when available.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Overall the efficacy results of the first randomised Phase II alloHSCT trial (MC-FludT.16/NM) in paediatric  
patients  with  non-malignant  diseases  demonstrated  a  benefit  for  the  treosulfan  conditioning  regimen 
over busulfan conditioning regimen in the selected subject population regarding Freedom from transplant 
(treatment) related mortality until day +100 after HSCT, TRM, OS, GvHD-free and cGvHD-free survival 
and  EFS  despite  a  higher  rate  of  secondary  graft  failures  and  lower  complete  donor-type  chimerism. 
Therefore, in children with non-malignant diseases indicated for alloHSCT the risk of graft failure must 
be  carefully  weighed  against  the  risk  of  TRM,  especially  when  an  unrelated  (MUD)  or  partly  matched 
alloHSCT is proposed and treosulfan is part of their preparative regimen for alloHSCT.  
As per the final CTR of the MCFludT.16/NM trial, the Transplant-related mortality (TRM) after treosulfan 
is lower than after busulfan which translates into an OS of treosulfan-treated patients at least comparable 
to the one of busulfan-treated patients which is reassuring.   
When  comparing  the two treatment  arms –  treosulfan  and  busulfan  –  form  the  MC-FludT.16/NM  trial 
were conditioning prior HSCT was tested in patients with non-malignant diseases, it is possible to observe 
that the rate of TEAEs, TESAEs and significant TEAEs was similar in the 2 treatment arms with only small 
differences on the CTCAE SOC and Term level. No unknown risks were identified in the trial and there 
was  no  occurrence  of  any  SUSARs.  Comparable  incidences  of  aGvHD  were  observed  between  the 
treatment arms, however, a significantly and clinically meaningful lower incidence of overall cGvHD was 
found with treosulfan. More deaths occurred in the busulfan arm than the treosulfan arm. Overall, safety 
results  favour  the  treatment  with  treosulfan  in  comparison  with  busulfan  in  for  conditioning  prior  to 
alloHSCT in paediatric patients with non-malignant diseases.   
The second Phase II trial in paediatric patients with malignant haematological disease (MC-FludT.17/M) 
has shown that a BSA-adapted i.v. dose of 10 g/m2, 12 g/m2, or 14 g/m2 Treosulfan given on Days -6, 
-5, and 4 can be successfully used as conditioning treatment before alloHSCT in the selected paediatric 
population.  However,  the  selected  BSA-adapted  dosing  required  further  justification/clarification.  The 
newly proposed regime (10 g/m2 for BSA <0.4 m2, 12 g/m2 for 0.4≤BSA<0.9 m2 and 14 g/m2 for BSA
≥0.9 m2) resulted in an increase in the % of values >3600 mg*h/L in all groups. Also, for the BSA levels 
of 0.4, 0.5, 0.9, and 1.0 m2 max AUC values of 4361, 4719, 4209 and 4147 mg*h/L were simulated. 
The proposed final BSA-categories for dose calculation seem adequate. 
Based  on  the  engraftment  and  chimerism  data  approaching  100%  and  >  90%,  respectively,  efficacy 
parameters  like  EFS,  OS,  and  GvHD-free  and  relapse-free  survival  confirm  the  effectiveness  of  this 
conditioning treatment.

The adverse events presented were already included in section 4.8 of the SmPC related with paediatric 
population.  Among  the  TESAEs,  upper  respiratory  infection  and  febrile  neutropenia  are  reported,  the 
former is not clearly included in SmPC and the latter is included with unknown frequency. No unknown 
risks were identified and there was no occurrence of any SUSARs. At the end of the trial where treosulfan 
was  included  in  the  conditioning  regime  for  patients  with  malignant  diseases,  20%  subjects  (n=14) 
terminated the trial prematurely, being death from relapse/progression and transplantation-related the 
main cause in 17.1% of the subjects (n=12). Laboratory parameters and vital signs did not change and 
performance scores were as expected.  
Acute GvHD Grade III-IV was reported in less than 9% of the subjects and was maintained at 100 days. 
Also, for chronic GvHD cumulative incidence did not change up to the end of the duration of the trial’s 
follow-up, i.e. 36 months. 
Overall, safety data gathered from the MU-FludT.17/M trial is in line with the adverse reactions listed for 
adults and paediatric patients already included in the approved PI and can be explained by the intensive 
treatment  prior  alloHSCT  of  treosulfan  on  top  of  standardized  fludarabine,  and  in  the  majority  of  the 
cases also with thiotepa, as well due to the underlying malignant disease (ALL, AML, MDS, and JMML) 
and transplantation-procedure per se. Safety are comparable to those reported for treosulfan in other 
trials and comparable or even favourable to those reported for BU- or TBI-based conditioning regimens. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Overall,  the  reported  efficacy  and  safety  results  of  these  two  Phase  II  allo-HSCT  trials  resulted  in  a 
positive  benefit  judgement  for  the  Treosulfan-based  conditioning  regimen  used  in  paediatric  patients 
with selected malignant diseases and non-malignant diseases, with an expected and manageable safety 
profile confirming the approved indication in paediatric patients with malignant diseases as well as in 
paediatric patients with selected non-malignant diseases. The efficacy and safety results obtained from 
the MU-FludT.16/NM also support the benefit of using treosulfan instead of a Busulfan-based condition 
regimen in paediatric patients with non-malignant diseases facing a comparable safety profile and thus 
allow to support the request for an extension of the use of Treosulfan to this population. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Furthermore,  summarised  results  of  TREO-based  conditioning  are  available  from  four  EBMT  registry 
analyses [Nagler 2017; Shimoni 2015/2021; Peters 2011/2017]. 
A conditioning regimen consisting of 14 g/m²/d × 3 TREO Day -6/-5/-4 plus FLU (FT10 14) and preferably 
combined with TT resulted in a very high disease-free and overall survival rate in paediatric patients with 
malignant as well as non-malignant disorders. The efficacy of this regimen is supported by data from 
the  EBMT  registry  that  included  a  total  of  1  416  patients  with  malignant  or  non-malignant  diseases. 
Furthermore, a large number of published trials of other study groups support the use of TREO-based 
conditioning in these patients. Meanwhile, two European guidelines recommend the use of TREO-based 
conditioning in patients with MDS as well as primary immunodeficiencies. Paediatric patients seem to 
tolerate  higher  doses  of  TREO  compared  to  adults  since  most  safety  parameters  were  comparable  to 
results obtained with the FT10 regimen used in adult patients.  
The data strongly suggest that TREO-based conditioning is an effective and safe treatment for paediatric 
patients with malignant as well as non-malignant diseases.

Extension of indication to include additional non-malignant transplant indications (non-malignant 
diseases in the paediatric population) for Trecondi 1 g/5 g powder for solution for infusion based on 
final 12-months follow-up results of study MC-FludT.16/NM; a randomised phase II interventional 
study aimed to compare Treosulfan-based conditioning therapy with Busulfan-based conditioning prior 
to allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in paediatric patients with non-malignant 
diseases. 
Further, the MAH proposes to amend an existing warning on skin toxicity based on new literature data. 
Moreover, the MAH proposes to introduce a slightly modified dosing regimen according to the patient’s 
body surface based on long-term follow-up data of paediatric study MC-FludT.17/M, a Phase II trial to 
describe the safety and efficacy of Treosulfan based conditioning therapy prior to allogeneic 
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in paediatric patients with haematological malignancies, as 
well as a final analysis of the population pharmacokinetics of treosulfan in paediatric patients. As a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is 
updated in accordance. Version 1.4 of the RMP has also been submitted. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and 
to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).  
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annexes I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0346/2020 and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

1.  Introduction 
On 14 November 2019, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study MET57 for Hexaxim/ 
Hexacima/Hexyon, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that MET57, Immunogenicity and Safety of an Investigational Quadrivalent 
Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccine Administered Concomitantly with Other Paediatric Vaccines in 
Healthy Toddlers is a standalone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
South Korea and Thailand: MenACYW conjugate vaccine + measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) + varicella 
(V) 
Mexico: MenACYW conjugate vaccine + diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, hepatitis B, 
poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenzae type-b (DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib) 
Russian Federation: MenACYW conjugate vaccine + pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
Hexaxim/Hexacima/Hexyon is indicated for active immunisation (primary and booster vaccination) of 
infants and toddlers from six weeks to 24 months of age against diphtheria (D), tetanus (T), 
pertussis, Hepatitis B (Hep B), poliomyelitis and invasive diseases caused by Haemophilus influenzae 
type b (Hib). 
The MAH submitted the final report for: 
MET57:  
“Immunogenicity and safety of an Investigational Quadrivalent Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccine 
administered concomitantly with other pediatric vaccines in healthy toddlers”   
(South Korea, Thailand, the Russian Federation, and Mexico) 
This study was not conducted as part of the EU-approved Paediatric Investigational Plan for this 
product (EMEA 001201-PIP01-11-M02). 
The primary objective of this study is to describe the immunogenicity profile of MenACYW conjugate 
vaccine administered alone or concomitantly with licensed paediatric vaccine(s) (MMR+V, DTaP-IPV-
HB-Hib, or PCV13). Due to the study focus on MenACWY only results from the two groups (Groups 4 + 
6, in Mexico) receiving Hexacima (licensed in Mexico) will be discussed in detail in this report. A 
general overview of the study is given below with the information regarding those two groups bolded.

2.3.1.  Clinical study 
MET57: “Immunogenicity and safety of an Investigational Quadrivalent 
Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccine administered concomitantly with other 
pediatric vaccines in healthy toddlers” 
Description 
The purpose of MET57 was to demonstrate that the immunogenicity and safety profiles of a single dose 
of MenACYW conjugate vaccine when administered alone in toddlers 12 to 23 months old were 
comparable to when MenACYW conjugate vaccine was given concomitantly with licensed paediatric 
vaccine(s) (measles-mumps-rubella [MMR] + varicella [V], diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, 
hepatitis B, poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenzae type-b [DTaPIPV- HB-Hib], or pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine [PCV13]), and that the immunogenicity and safety of vaccines routinely 
administered to toddlers were not affected by concomitant administration with MenACYW conjugate 
vaccine. 
Methods 
Objectives 
The primary objective is to describe the immunogenicity profile of MenACYW conjugate vaccine 
administered alone or concomitantly with licensed paediatric vaccine(s) (MMR+V, DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib, or 
PCV13. 
The secondary objective is to describe the immunogenicity profile of licensed paediatric vaccine(s) 
(MMR+V, DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib, or PCV13) when administered alone or concomitantly with MenACYW 
conjugate vaccine. 
Observational Objectives 
Immunogenicity 
To describe the Ab responses to the meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W before and 30 days 
(+14 days) after vaccination with MenACYW conjugated vaccine measured by serum bactericidal assay 
using baby rabbit complement (rSBA) in all subjects in Group 1 and Group 2 and in a subset of 
subjects in Group 4, Group 5, Group 7, and Group 8 (100 subjects per group in Groups 1, 4, and 7; 50 
subjects per group in Groups 2, 5, and 8) (South Korea, Mexico, and the Russian Federation only). 
Safety 
•  To describe the safety profile of MenACYW conjugate vaccine when administered alone or 
concomitantly with licensed pediatric vaccine(s) (MMR+V, DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib, or PCV13) 
•  To describe the safety profile of licensed pediatric vaccine(s) (MMR+V, DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib, or 
PCV13) when administered alone or concomitantly with MenACYW conjugate vaccine 
Study design 
Phase III, open-label, randomized, parallel-group, active-controlled, multicentre study.  
Two groups out of the 12 of the study have received either MenACYW conjugate vaccine and DTaP IPV 
HB-Haemophilus influenzae Type b (PRP)~T vaccine (200 subjects), or DTaP IPV HB-PRP~T vaccine 
alone (100 subjects), at 12 to 23 months of age. This study took place in Mexico.

In South Korea and Mexico, healthy, meningococcal-vaccine naïve toddlers aged 12 to 23 months on 
the day of enrolment were randomized in a 2:1:1 ratio (by country) to the following groups: 
Mexico: 
Group 4: MenACYW conjugate vaccine + DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib on D0 
Group 5: MenACYW conjugate vaccine on D0 
Group 6: DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib on D0 
South Korea: 
Group 1: MenACYW conjugate vaccine + MMR + V on Day (D) 0 
Group 2: MenACYW conjugate vaccine on D0 
Group 3: MMR + V on D0 
In the Russian Federation, healthy, meningococcal-vaccine naïve toddlers aged 12 to 14 months or 16 
to 23 months on the day of enrolment were assigned to Group 8 with a balanced population 
distribution of half of the subjects aged 12 to 14 months and half of the subjects aged 16 to 23 
months. Healthy, meningococcal-vaccine naïve toddlers, who had not received the 3rd dose of PCV13, 
aged 15 to 23 months on the day of enrolment were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to Groups 7 and 9, in 
order to comply with the National Immunization Calendar of the Russian Federation: 
The Russian Federation: 
Group 7: MenACYW conjugate vaccine + PCV13 on D0 
Group 8: MenACYW conjugate vaccine on D0 
Group 9: PCV13 on D0 (Visit 1) 
Note about Visits: 
Visit 0=Screening visit for subjects in the Russian Federation only 
Visit 1=D0, vaccination visit (all countries) 
Visit 2=D30 (+14 days), 30 to 44 days after D0 (all countries) 
In the Russian Federation, Visit 0 and Visit 1 may have taken place on the same day, or Visit 1 may have 
taken place up to 5 days after Visit 0. 
In Thailand, healthy, meningococcal-vaccine naïve toddlers aged 12 to 23 months on the day of 
enrolment were randomized in a 2:1:1 ratio to the following groups: 
Thailand: 
Group 10: MenACYW conjugate vaccine + MMR + V on D0 
Group 11: MenACYW conjugate vaccine on D0 
Group 12: MMR + V on D0 
All Subjects: 
All subjects were to provide blood samples for immunogenicity assessment at baseline (pre-
vaccination) and at Visit 2 (30 to 44 days after vaccination[s]). Solicited adverse event (AE) 
information was collected for 7 days after vaccination(s); unsolicited AE information was collected from 
EMA/89372/2020  
Page 5/15 
 
  
 
 
 
Visit 1 (D0) to Visit 2, and serious adverse event (SAE) information was collected throughout the study 
period from Visit 1 through Visit 2. Upon completion of all study procedures and termination from the 
trial at Visit 2, study participants were to receive the remainder of the recommended toddler vaccines, 
which were part of the respective National Immunization Programs (NIP) for each country, from their 
health care provider. 
Laboratory assays were the same as for the previous studies; analysis was done at the sponsor’s 
laboratory in Swiftwater, USA.

Statistical Methods 
All analyses were descriptive. No hypotheses were tested. All immunogenicity analyses were performed 
on the Per-Protocol Analysis Set (PPAS). Additional immunogenicity analyses were performed for 
exploratory purposes on the Full Analysis Set (FAS) according to randomization group. All safety 
analyses were performed on the Safety Analysis Set (SafAS). 
Immunogenicity 
Descriptive statistics were provided for the Ab titers against meningococcal serogroups contained in 
MenACYW conjugate vaccine and for the antigens contained in the licensed vaccines. In general, 
categorical variables were summarized and presented by frequency counts, percentages, and CIs. The 
95% CIs of point estimates were calculated using the normal approximation for quantitative data and 
the exact binomial distribution (Clopper- Pearson method) for percentages. For geometric mean titers 
(GMTs) or geometric mean concentrations (GMCs), 95% CIs of point estimates were calculated using 
normal approximation assuming they are log-normally distributed. 
For the Primary Objective 
The immunogenicity descriptive analyses at least included the following: 
Ab titers against meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W measured by hSBA before and 30 days 
after vaccination with MenACYW conjugate vaccine: 
•  GMT and 95% CI 
•  Titer distribution and reverse cumulative distribution curve (RCDCs) 
•  Percentage of subjects with titer ≥ 1:4 and ≥ 1:8 and 95% CI 
•  Percentage of subjects with titer ≥ 4-fold rise from pre-vaccination to postvaccination, and 
95% CI 
•  Percentage of subjects with hSBA vaccine seroresponse* 
* hSBA vaccine seroresponse for serogroups A, C, Y, and W was defined as: 
• 
• 
For a subject with a pre-vaccination titer < 1:8, the post-vaccination titer had to be ≥ 1:16. 
For a subject with a pre-vaccination titer ≥ 1:8, the post-vaccination titer had to be at least 4-fold greater 
than the pre-vaccination titer. 
For the Secondary Objective 
The analyses on the concomitant vaccines included GMTs and titer distribution or GMCs, and RCDCs, as 
well as percentage of subjects with: 
•  Abs to the antigens contained in MMR vaccine measured before and 30 days after vaccination 
with MMR vaccine:

D30 
o  Anti-pertussis (PT and FHA) Ab concentrations and pertussis vaccine response† 
o  Abs to the antigens contained in DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib vaccine measured 30 days after 
vaccination with DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib vaccine: 
  Anti-diphtheria Ab concentrations ≥ 0.1 and 1.0 IU/mL 
  Anti-PRP Ab concentrations ≥ 0.15 and 1.0 μg/mL 
  Anti-poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 Ab titers ≥ 1:8 
  Anti-HBsAg Ab concentrations ≥ 10 and 100 milli-international units (mIU)/mL 
† Pertussis vaccine response: 
• 
• 
If the pre-booster vaccination concentration is < 4 x lower limit of quantification (LLOQ), then the 
post-booster vaccination concentration is ≥ 4 x the pre-booster concentration; 
If the pre-booster vaccination concentration is ≥ 4 x LLOQ, then the post-booster vaccination 
concentration is ≥ 2 x the pre-booster concentration. 
•  Anti-pneumococcal Ab concentrations ≥ 0.35 μg/mL and 1.0 μg/mL and 95% CI for serotypes 
1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F measured before and 30 days after 
vaccination with PCV13 vaccine

Page 9/15 
 
  
 
 
 
* rSBA vaccine seroresponse was defined as a post-vaccination titer ≥ 1:32 for subjects with pre-vaccination rSBA 
titer < 1:8, or a post-vaccination titer ≥ 4 times the prevaccination titer for subjects with pre-vaccination rSBA titer 
≥ 1:8. 
Safety 
Safety results were described for subjects in all study groups. The main parameters for the safety 
endpoints were described by 95% CIs (based on the Clopper-Pearson method). 
Results 
In the Mexican study groups the children were comparable regarding age and ethnicity. The 
male/female ratio was also similar in the groups with slightly more male subjects (~53%) in each 
group. 
Number analysed 
A total of 1183 subjects were enrolled in this study and randomly allocated to one of the following 
groups depending on the country: Group 1 (107 subjects), Group 2 (53 subjects), and Group 3 (53 
subjects) in South Korea, Group 4 (200 subjects), Group 5 (100 subjects), and Group 6 (100 subjects) 
in Mexico, Group 7 (200 subjects), Group 8 (100 subjects), and Group 9 (100 subjects) in the Russian 
Federation, and Group 10 (86 subjects), Group 11 (42 subjects), and Group 12 (42 subjects) in 
Thailand. 
There were no early terminations due to an SAE (there was a single instance of early termination due 
to a non-serious AE of gastroenteritis). A total of 1177 (99.5%) subjects received vaccine and all of 
these subjects received the vaccine as randomized. A total of 1159 (98.0%) subjects completed the 
trial.

Assessor’s comment: 
Serological protection thresholds are reached in all cases and for all antigens of Hexyon regardless of concomitant or staggered use of Hexyon and 
MenACWY. 
GMTs are often slightly higher in the staggered use group (6) but the Polio antibody GMTs are slightly higher in concomitant use. 
Overall, the results confirm the information already to be found in the Hexyon SmPC.

Assessor’s comment: 
Solicited AEs were not more frequent in the concomitant versus staggered groups.  
No deaths occurred in this study.  
No SAEs related to the vaccines were reported. No (S)AEs led to discontinuation of the study. 
Otherwise similar event rates were seen for solicited local and systemic events as already known from 
other trials with this vaccine.  
No safety issues are identified. 
The safety profile remains unchanged. 
Discussion on clinical aspects 
For both safety and immunogenicity the results of this study confirm the information known and 
already reflected in the product information.  
Overall, this study does not add new information regarding the immunogenicity and safety. The 
benefit-risk profile remains unchanged.  
CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

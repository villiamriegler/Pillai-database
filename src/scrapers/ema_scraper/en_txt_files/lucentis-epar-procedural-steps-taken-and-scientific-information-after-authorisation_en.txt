1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

based on final results from study CRFB002H2301E 
(RAINBOW extension), listed as a PAES in the Annex 
II; this is an extension study to evaluate the long

with laser therapy for the treatment of infants born 
prematurely with retinopathy of prematurity. The 
Annex II and Package Leaflet are updated 
accordingly. The RMP version 22.0 has also been

It is unknown whether Lucentis is excreted in human milk. 
Based on very limited data, ranibizumab may be excreted 
in human milk at low levels. The effect of ranibizumab on a

breast-feeding is not recommended during the use of

assessment done under A 45/46 - Change(s) with 
new additional data submitted by the MAH 
Small amounts of Lucentis may pass into breast milk, 
therefore Lucentis is not recommended during breast-
feeding because it is not known whether Lucentis passes 
into human milk. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice 
before Lucentis treatment. 
The benefit-risk balance of Lucentis remains positive.

also proposed to reflect the completion of the 
studies. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
Lucentis in patients with visual impairment due to macular 
oedema secondary to RVO were assessed in the BRIGHTER 
(BRVO) and CRYSTAL (CRVO) studies. In both studies, 
subjects received a 0.5 mg ranibizumab PRN dosing 
regimen driven by individualised stabilisation criteria. 
BRIGHTER was a 3-arm randomised active-controlled study 
that compared 0.5 mg ranibizumab given as monotherapy 
or in combination with adjunctive laser photocoagulation to 
laser photocoagulation alone. After 6 months, subjects in 
the laser arm could receive 0.5 mg ranibizumab. CRYSTAL 
was a single-arm study with 0.5 mg ranibizumab 
monotherapy. 
In BRIGHTER, ranibizumab 0.5 mg with adjunctive laser 
therapy demonstrated non-inferiority versus ranibizumab 
monotherapy from baseline to Month 24. In both studies, a 
rapid and statistically significant decrease from baseline in 
central retinal subfield thickness was observed at Month 1. 
This effect was maintained up to Month 24. The effect of 
ranibizumab treatment was similar irrespective of the 
presence of retinal ischaemia. The effect in terms of visual 
improvement was observed in all patients treated with 0.5 
mg ranibizumab monotherapy regardless of their disease 
duration in both BRIGHTER and CRYSTAL. Treatment 
initiation at the time of diagnosis should be considered. 
There are insufficient data to conclude on the effect of 
Lucentis in patients with RVO presenting irreversible 
ischaemic visual function loss. 
The long term safety profile of ranibizumab observed in the 
24 month studies is consistent with the known Lucentis 
safety profile.

collectively almost 30,000 injections showed no beneficial 
effect of the use of antibiotic eye drops immediately before 
and/or after intravitreal injection. However, frequent and 
periodic use of antibiotic eye drops has been demonstrated 
to cause antimicrobial resistance. Therefore, the CHMP 
agreed to no longer recommend prophylactic antibiotics 
with injections of Lucentis but rather to advise to follow 
local clinical practice. Other minor changes to the SmPC

evidence for a causal relationship between these events 
and the use of ranibizumab. However, as a causal

SmPC, Annex 
Based upon the data that have become available since the 
II, Labelling 
granting of the initial Marketing Authorisation, the CHMP 
and PL 
considers that the benefit-risk balance of Lucentis remains 
positive, but considers that its safety profile is to be closely 
monitored for the following reasons: 
- The recently approved new indications, treatment of 
visual impairment due to DME and macular oedema 
secondary to RVO, imply that the population receiving 
Lucentis treatment will be broader and may include 
patients at potentially higher risk of cardiovascular 
systemic adverse events; 
- There are at present ongoing safety issues concerning 
systemic adverse events such as the EPITT signal 
hypertensive crisis; 
- The data quality issues related to Ranibizumab 
Reimbursement Scheme and Patient Support Program 
adverse event reporting introduce uncertainty to the 
assessment of post-marketing safety data.

was revised. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
The originally approved posology in wet AMD, based on 
three initial monthly injections and re-treatment in case of 
a 5-letter loss of VA, was not optimal.  
Analyses of the currently available monotherapy data from 
completed AMD studies (MARINA, ANCHOR, PIER, EXCITE, 
SUSTAIN, MONT BLANC, DENALI) were carried out. This 
was the basis for an update of the SPC and Package Leaflet 
with an alternative posology for the ranibizumab treatment 
of patients with wet AMD following a concept of an 
individualised PRN treatment which is driven by monitoring 
of the stability. 
Page 30/38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The SPC was brought in line with the recommendations for 
DME and RVO-indications, based on a 'stability concept' 
(i.e. monthly injections administered until no further 
improvement is observed and re-treatment initiated when 
there is a loss of Visual Acuity due to disease activity). 
The new section 4.2 of the SPC (posology) for wet AMD 
reads: 
"In wet AMD, the recommended dose for Lucentis is 0.5 mg 
given monthly as a single intravitreal injection. This 
corresponds to an injection volume of 0.05 ml. 
Treatment is given monthly and continued until maximum 
visual acuity is achieved i.e. the patient's visual acuity is 
stable for three consecutive monthly assessments 
performed while on ranibizumab treatment. 
Thereafter patients should be monitored monthly for visual 
acuity. 
Treatment is resumed when monitoring indicates loss of 
visual acuity due to wet AMD. Monthly injections should 
then be administered until stable visual acuity is reached 
again for three consecutive monthly assessments (implying 
a minimum of two injections). 
The interval between two doses should not be shorter than 
1 month." 
This variation also affected section 3 of the PL.

combination treatment did not give rise to any new 
concerns regarding the frequency, or the adverse event 
profile. Therefore, as recommended by the CHMP, section 
5.1 of the SPC was revised to include the final 9-month 
safety data from the study. The text included reads as 
follows: "Data from an open label study (PROTECT) in 32 
patients followed for 9 months in which the safety of same-
day administration of verteporfin PDT and Lucentis 0.5mg 
was evaluated showed that the incidence of intraocular 
inflammation following the initial treatment was 6.3% (2 of 
32 patients)".

Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Elaprase, the scientific conclusions 
of PRAC are as follows:  
During the previous PSUR period updates were made to the CCDS and SmPC regarding the relationship 
between antibody status and clinical efficacy and safety. In particular, a warning was included in section 
4.4 of the SmPC regarding that patients with the complete deletion/large rearrangement genotype tend 
to show a muted response to treatment. On review of the information in the current CCDS it is noted 
there is further information included regarding this subgroup of patients, in particular that patients with 
this genotype also have a higher probability of developing infusion-related adverse events. This 
increased risk is also acknowledged in the information included in the present PSUR. To bring the EU 
product information in-line with the known safety profile of IV Idursulfase, the MAH is requested to 
update the warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC to include this point. This additional information should 
also be added under the “Description of selected adverse reactions in section 4.8 of the SmPC with a 
cross reference to section 4.4. The package leaflet should be updated accordingly. 
In view of available data regarding IV Idursulfase, the PRAC considered that these changes to the 
product information were warranted.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Elaprase, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance idursulfase is favourable subject to 
the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

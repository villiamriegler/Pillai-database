encephalopathy (impaired consciousness, confusion,

months to years after beginning efavirenz therapy. Some 
events of late-onset neurotoxicity have occurred in patients 
with CYP2B6 genetic polymorphisms, which are associated 
with increased efavirenz levels despite standard dosing of 
Stocrin. Patients presenting with signs and symptoms of 
serious neurologic adverse experiences should be evaluated

efavirenz was revised as follows: Efavirenz should not be 
used during pregnancy, unless the patient's clinical 
condition requires such treatment. Additionally, women of 
childbearing potential should undergo pregnancy testing 
before initiation of efavirenz. Prescribers are referred to

warfarin. No interaction study has been performed. 
Warfarin is administered as a racemate; the S-enantiomer 
provides most of the anticoagulation effect and is 
metabolised by CYP2C9 while the R-enantiomer is 
metabolised by CYP3A4. Efavirenz is an inducer of CYP3A4 
and in vitro data have indicated that it is also an inhibitor of 
CYP2C9. Due to these dual properties of efavirenz, the 
following information was added: an increase or decrease

norgestimate (NGM) did not have a significant impact on EE 
exposures; however, significantly reduced exposures to 
norelgestromin (NGMN) and levonorgestrel (LNG), the 
active metabolites of NGM, were observed. The exact 
mechanism of this interaction is not elucidated, but is 
possibly due to inhibition and induction of multiple 
metabolic pathways. The reduced exposures raise concern 
as to the potential negative impact on the efficacy of the 
hormonal combination. Consequently it is recommended 
Page 18/36
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet
that for patients taking EFV 600 mg once daily a reliable 
method of barrier contraception must be used in addition to 
oral hormonal contraceptives.
In a study reported in the published literature, no 
significant differences in depo-medroxyprogesterone 
acetate (DMPA) pharmacokinetic parameters were found 
between subjects receiving EFV-containing antiretroviral 
therapy and subjects receiving no antiretroviral therapy. 
Similar results were found in study ACTG 5093 (although 
the DMPA plasma levels were found to be more variable). 
In these studies, plasma progesterone levels for subjects 
receiving EFV and DMPA remained low consistent with 
suppression of ovulation. However due to the global limited 
information available, a reliable method of barrier 
contraception must be used in addition to injectable 
hormonal contraceptives containing DMPA. 
The interaction between EFV and the implantable hormonal 
contraceptive, etonogestrel, has not been studied; 
however, there have been reports of unplanned 
pregnancies in women taking both, possibly due to 
induction of metabolic enzymes such as CYP3A4 by EFV. 
Thus, a reliable method of barrier contraception must be 
used in addition to implantable hormonal contraceptives 
when taking EFV.

data in antiretroviral naive patients, was performed and 
has been provided to further monitor and characterise 
lipodystrophy. The results of this review confirmed that the 
long-term treatment with efavirenz is associated with 
increases in total and HDL cholesterol (21-31% and 23-
34%, respectively) and showed increases in triglycerides 
(23%) and LDL (18%). Although the clinical significance of 
this small increase in triglycerides is yet uncertain, this new 
information is now being reflected in section 4.8 of the SPC.

shown in a study performed in healthy volunteers. On 
average the decreases of AUC, Cmax and Cmin at steady 
state were of 36%, 21% and 47% for efavirenz and 27%, 
20% and 35% for carbamazepine. The available data does 
not allow any recommendation for dosage adjustment. 
However, intensification of therapeutic monitoring 
considered, when efavirenz is added to a regimen of 
carbamazepine. Section 4.4 under subheading “seizures” 
and section 4.5 subheading “anticonvulsivants” of the SPC 
are amended to reflect this information. Section 2 of the PL 
is updated in accordance.  
The majority of the adverse reactions reported were 
consistent with those for individual medicinal products. The 
overall incidence of the adverse reactions for each agent 
alone and for the combination was similar.

the fed state and also that for the tablets the impact 
seemed even greater. As a post-renewal commitment a 
safety comparison between the hard capsules and the film-
coated tablets derived from clinical trials, spontaneous and 
literature reports was submitted. Following the assessment 
of this data the CHMP concluded that in the presence of 
food an increase of efavirenz serum concentrations and an 
increase of the frequency of adverse reactions was 
observed. As this effect could be more evident for the film-
coated tablets than for the hard capsules, the CHMP 
requested the update of the SPC and PL of both solid 
formulations to recommend the administration of Stocrin on 
an empty stomach preferable at bedtime to improve the 
tolerability of nervous system undesirable effects.

interaction of both drugs in uninfected volunteers. 
Following the CHMP request, the SPC and PL of Stocrin are 
being updated to contraindicate the use of efavirenz and 
voriconazol due to the decrease in the plasma 
concentrations of voriconazol caused by efavirenz and also 
to the increase of efavirenz plasma concentrations caused 
by voriconazol.
 On average, efavirenz (400mg daily) decreased the steady 
state Cmax and AUC0-? of oral voriconazole (400 mg q12h 
starting dose, then 200 mg q12h) by 61% and 77%, 
respectively while voriconazole increases the steady state

antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory response to 
indolent or residual opportunistic infections may occur, 
when the immune system responds to treatment. 
In most cases, the inflammatory reactions towards the 
opportunistic pathogens in question cannot be foreseen 
since the opportunistic infection has not yet been 
detected/diagnosed. If diagnosed prior to institution of 
CART, the treatment against the opportunistic infection 
(OI) is usually given priority. In particular, this is true for 
the complications most feared in this context; CMV-
retinitis, generalised mycobacterial infections and 
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.  An additional reason for 
treating the OI and the HIV-infection sequentially is the 
great risk of adverse events (toxicity or lack of effect) due 
to drug interactions. 
Page 29/36
The clinical consequence of the reactivation of the immune 
system in patients starting CART cannot be prevented and 
the early recognition and diagnose of these inflammatory 
reaction is considering to be important to the clinical 
handling of the patients. Therefore, the CHMP further to the 
assessment of MAH's responses and discussions held at the 
pharmacovigilance working party and CHMP, a class 
labelling text regarding the reactivation of the immune 
system of HIV-infected patients treated with any type of 
combination antiretroviral therapy (CART) was agreed to be 
implemented in all anti-retroviral product information

therapeutic regimens based on the combination of 
efavirenz with indinavir (800 mg twice daily regimen) 
boosted by ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) were evaluated in 
two post-marketing studies: one in healthy volunteers, a 
non-MAH sponsored study conducted by Aarnoutse et 
al.(Clin Pharmacol Ther 2002) and the other in a sub-set of 
HIV-infected patients included in the EASIER study (report 
906-01). 
The pharmacokinetic results are not significantly different 
from the results obtained with a similar combination in 
Page 30/36
healthy volunteers. The impact of efavirenz on the 
pharmacokinetics of this combination is not clinically 
significant. Although no conclusions in terms of posology 
and mode of administration could be recommended, the 
available data is relevant to the clinical practice and 
therefore is included in section 4.5 of the SPC. 
As an outcome of the CHMP assessment of study AI266049 
the incidence of pancreatitis and amylase increase was 
further discussed by the MAH. The new-onsets amylase 
elevations that, with a single exception, were not 
associated with a clinical diagnosis of pancreatitis were 
seen in approximately 10% of subjects who received 
efavirenz. The clinical significance of asymptomatic 
increases in serum amylase is unknown, however the 
available figures, compared with others drugs are relevant 
information for physicians, since amylasaemia is routinely 
determined for patients in most clinical settings and 
therefore section 4.8 of the SPC was updated.

The long-term (168 weeks) efficacy results suggest 
durability of response in terms of proportion of patients 
with HIV RNA < 400 copies/ml, HIV RNA <50 copies/ml 
and of mean changes from baseline CD4 cell counts. 
Section 5.1 was updated to reflect these results.
The long-term safety of the EFV+ZDV+3TC treatment 
regimen was not different from the already defined safety 
profile of EFV. The incidences of nervous system symptoms 
and rash beyond the 48 week of treatment were low.  The 
long-term safety profile in patients with HCV and/or HBV 
co-infection was not different from the previously profile 
known in this subset of patients. Section 4.8 of the SPC, 
subheading “nervous system symptoms” and “laboratory 
test abnormalities” were updated in regard of these

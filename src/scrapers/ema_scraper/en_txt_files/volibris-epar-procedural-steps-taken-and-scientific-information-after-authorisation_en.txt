regarding spontaneous safety reports, data of clinical trials, 
literature review and disproportionality analysis scores 
using data from the FDA  Spontaneous Reporting System 
(SRS)/Adverse  Event Reporting System (AERS)  database. 
In the light of all safety data provided, there is enough 
evidence to support a possible causal relationship between 
ambrisentan and the ADRs  ‘vision blurred’ and ‘visual 
impairment’. Therefore, these ADRs  have been included in 
the SmPC  and Package Leaflet for ambrisentan. 
The safety data provided as part of the cumulative review

Committee (PDCO)  (EMA Decision P/0062/2013 issued 26th 
March 2013). This PIP  refers to the condition “Primary and 
secondary pulmonary hypertension” and includes the 
following non-clinical measures: 
• 
Two-week juvenile animal study to determine 
tolerability and toxicokinetics of ambrisentan. 
• 
Eight-week juvenile animal study to determine oral 
toxicology and toxicokinetic of ambrisentan including an 8 
weeks recovery period. 
The objective of this variation is to submit the study report 
of the two-week juvenile animal study to determine the 
tolerability and toxicokinetics of ambrisentan.  
The CHMP considers that the results from the tolerability 
and toxicokinetics study of ambrisentan in juvenile rats do 
not alter the overall benefit risk assessment of Volibris for 
the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults.

Ambrisentan, a selective ETA receptor antagonist, has 
order to update the warning regarding reductions in 
shown to be effective in idiopathic PAH (IPAH)  and in PAH 
haemoglobin concentrations, to include updated 
information regarding male fertility, and to include 
data from the ambrisentan ARIES-E  study (A long 
term study of ambrisentan in pulmonary arterial 
hypertension subjects having completed AMB-320 
OR AMB-321). 
C.I.4  - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC  due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
associated with connective tissue disease (PAH-CTD).  In 
order to provide more information on the long-term effects 
of ambrisentan, patients in studies AMB-320 and AMB-321 
had the option of continuing (or starting, if on placebo) 
ambrisentan treatment through a long-term extension 
study, AMB-320/321-E (ARIES  E). 
The available information provided suggests a substantial 
improvement in survival at 1, 2 and 3 years in the PAH 
population compared to that which would ordinarily be 
anticipated. The observed probability of survival for 
subjects receiving Volibris (combined Volibris dose group) 
at 1, 2 and 3 years was 93%, 85% and 79% respectively. 
In addition, descriptive data on exposure and main primary 
endpoint in the ARIES  E study (incidence and severity of 
adverse events) has also been included in section 5.1 of 
the SmPC.  The distinction between IPAH and PAH-CTD  is 
not considered necessary. 
Regarding safety, the ADRs identified in the ARIES-E  study 
are consistent with the known safety profile of ambrisentan 
and/or the natural history and the seriousness of the 
disease. This study has provided evidence of long-term 
persistence in haemoglobin reductions, information which 
has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC.  This study 
has also provided data on 2-year risk of developing 
ALT/AST  elevations >x3ULN, long-term persistence in BP 
decreases that have been included in section 4.4 of the 
SmPC.  Lastly, although no clear evidence of a detrimental 
effect of ambrisentan long-term exposure on sperm count 
was found in ARIES-E  study, chronic administration of 
ambrisentan was associated with changes in markers of

MAH was requested to submit a type II  variation to include 
information on the potential severity of anaemia and cases 
of anaemia requiring transfusion in the SmPC.   
A cumulative review of patients who developed anaemia 
that required transfusion was submitted leading to changes 
in section 4.4 of the SmPC.  A footnote with this information 
was also added to the table of adverse drug reactions in 
section 4.8. The package leaflet was updated accordingly. 
In this variation the MAH also reviewed section 4.8 of the 
SmPC  following the Guideline on SmPC  (rev.2, Sep. 2009) 
recommendations, and merged into a single table all 
adverse drug reactions (from clinical studies and from 
spontaneous reporting) with their respective frequency

nasal cavity findings included increased red cell 
parameters.  These changes are considered to be directly 
or indirectly related to the pharmacological activity of 
ambrisentan.  The NOAEL  for non-neoplastic findings was 
lower than the low dose of 10 mg/kg/day, corresponding to 
<34.8 and <24.6 µg.h/mL in males and females, 
respectively.  The conclusion of this study was that there 
were no treatment-related increases in the incidence of 
tumours. 
Upon further review of the data from this rat study by the 
Japanese Health Authorities, a statistically significant 
increase in the incidence of mammary gland fibroadenoma 
was identified in males treated at the highest dose level 
(mean dietary dose of 42 mg/kg/day).   As a result of this 
assessment, the MAH proposed new wording for Section 
5.3 Preclinical safety data.  
The MAH also made a correction in section 5.3 of the SmPC 
as the statement referring to the rat embryofoetal study 
results was incomplete. 
After reviewing the data submitted the CHMP  considers that 
the proposed amendments to the SmPC  do not alter the 
overall favourable benefit risk assessment of ambrisentan 
for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension.

authorisation, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) 
made the following commitment to perform a drug-drug 
interaction (DDI) study with cyclosporine (FUM 001). 
The MAH conducted a phase 1, open-label, parallel-design, 
single-center study to assess the effect of multiple dose 
administration of CsA on the steady-state PK of 
ambrisentan and its circulating metabolite, 4 
hydroxymethyl ambrisentan and to assess the effect of 
multiple dose administration of ambrisentan on the steady-
state PK of CsA in healthy subjects.  
Steady-state co-administration of ambrisentan and 
cyclosporine A resulted in a 2-fold increase in ambrisentan 
exposure in healthy volunteers. This may be due to the 
Page 19/23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
inhibition by cyclosporine A of transporters and metabolic 
enzymes involved in the pharmacokinetics of ambrisentan. 
Therefore the dose of ambrisentan should be limited to 5 
mg once daily when co-administered with cyclosporine A 
and the patient should be carefully monitored. Multiple 
doses of ambrisentan had no effect on cyclosporine A 
exposure, and no dose adjustment of cyclosporine A is 
warranted. 
The Product information has been updated accordingly.

tadalafil and with an oral contraceptive pill were submitted 
in this variation application.  
The results of the drug interaction study with tadalfil 
showed Co-administration of ambrisentan with tadalafil 
(phosphodiesterase inhibitor, substrate of CYP3A4)  in 
healthy volunteers did not significantly affect the 
pharmacokinetics of either tadalafil or ambrisentan. 
In a clinical study in healthy volunteers, steady-state 
dosing with ambrisentan 10 mg once daily did not 
significantly affect the single-dose pharmacokinetics of the 
ethinyl estradiol and  norethindrone components of a 
combined oral contraceptive. Based on this 
pharmacokinetic study, ambrisentan would not be expected 
to significantly affect exposure to oestrogen- or

Based on this review, the MAH proposed to include in 
section 4.8 of the SPC  "Cardiac failure (associated to fluid 
retention)" as a cardiac adverse reaction identified through 
post-marketing surveillance and occurring with an unknown 
frequency. Additionally, the warning in section 4.4 was 
reworded to state that fluid retention shortly after starting 
ambrisentan may lead to decompensated heart failure and 
that pre-existing fluid overload should be managed prior to 
starting the drug. 
In addition, further to post-marketing reports of dyspnoea, 
in particular, reports of dyspnoea occurring shortly after 
starting ambrisentan therapy, the MAH has performed a 
cumulative review of reports of dyspnoea (dyspnoea, 
dyspnoea exertional, respiratory distress, asthma, hypoxia, 
and wheezing) identified up to 15 February 2008. A total of 
108 cases of dyspnoea were retrieved. In 44 there was no 
information to assess time to onset. Among the remaining 
64 cases, 32 involved a time to onset of ? 1 week,  10 had a 
time to onset > 1 week and ? 3 weeks, and 22 had a time 
to onset > 3 weeks. Regarding the 32 cases presented 
within the first week, all were spontaneous reports and 17 
were medically confirmed. These cases provide some 
evidence of a causal association with ambrisentan. 
Based on this review, the MAH proposed to include 
dyspnoea in section 4.8 of the SPC  as a respiratory ADR

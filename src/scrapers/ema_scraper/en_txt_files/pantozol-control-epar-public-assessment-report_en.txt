1.    BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE PROCEDURE 
1.1 
Submission of the dossier 
The  applicant  Nycomed  GmbH  submitted  on  28  April  2008  an  application  for  Marketing 
Authorisation  to  the  European  Medicines  Agency  (EMEA)  for  PANTOZOL  Control,  through  the 
centralised procedure under Article 3(2)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. In addition, the applicant 
proposed  the  classification  for  supply  of  PANTOZOL  Control  to  “medicinal  product  not  subject  to 
medical prescription”. 
to 
the  centralised  procedure  was  agreed  upon  by 
The  eligibility 
the  EMEA/CHMP  on 
13 December 2007.  The  eligibility  to  the  centralised  procedure  under  Article  3(2)(b)  of  Regulation 
(EC) No 726/2004 was based on demonstration of interest of patients at Community level considering 
the possibility to obtain a pan-European non-prescription status. This took into account that the need 
for  an  optimal  self-treatment  of  heartburn  is  universal  and  that  it  is  in  patients’  interest  across  the 
community  to  allow  access  to  a  pantoprazole  product  with  harmonised  legal  status.  In  addition,  it 
would  give  Community-wide  access  and  consumer  protection,  based  on  harmonised  labelling  and 
avoid diverted markets. 
The  legal  basis  for  this  application  refers  to  Article  10(3)  of  Directive  2001/83/EC,  as  amended  – 
hybrid application.

SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
2.1 
Introduction 
Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is defined as a condition which develops when the reflux 
of stomach contents causes troublesome symptoms and/or complications. Reflux of gastric acid into 
the  oesophagus  is  mediated  by  different  mechanisms  such  as  transient  lower  oesophageal  sphincter 
relaxations  or  reduced  pressure,  impaired  oesophageal  clearance  and  hiatus  hernia.  Factors  such  as 
hormonal  and  neuronal  mechanisms,  medication,  food  and  lifestyle  can  also  contribute  to  the 
pathophysiology.  
Heartburn  and  acid  regurgitation  are  the  most  common  symptoms  associated  with  GORD  and  the 
condition  can  adversely  affect  the  individual’s  quality  of  life.  Mild  symptoms  occurring  2  or  more 
days  per  week  or  moderate  to  severe  symptoms  occurring  more  than  1  day  per  week  are  often 
considered troublesome for patients. Heartburn describes a burning feeling, rising from the stomach or 
lower  chest  and  radiating  toward  the  neck,  throat  and  occasionally  the  back.  It  usually  occurs  after 
large meals or after eating spicy foods, citrus products, fats, chocolates or drinking alcohol. Night time 
heartburn may cause sleeping difficulties and impair next-day function. Regurgitation is defined as the 
perception of flow of refluxed gastric content into the mouth or hypopharynx. 
Some tests are available to diagnose GORD patients. However, the presence of frequent heartburn and 
acid regurgitation are sufficiently accurate to identify the disease. Initial GORD treatment is usually 
managed  by  a  symptom-based  rather  than  a  pathogenesis-based  approach.  An  empiric  trial  of  acid 
suppression  is  the  simplest  method  used  for  GORD  diagnosis  and  to  assess  its  relationship  to 
symptoms. Symptoms responding adequately to an acid suppressant and returning when medication is 
discontinued allows a diagnosis of GORD. Non-responders to acid suppression could indicate the role 
of other factors. The majority of patients with reflux symptoms can be controlled at the self-care level 
or  a  primary  care  level.  Non-prescription  medicines  for  relief  from  heartburn  include  antacids, 
alginates, histamine2-receptor antagonist and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Recent clinical guidelines 
recommend  treatment  with  PPIs  as  initial  therapy  for  patients  with  symptoms  impacting  on  their 
quality of life, while histamine2-receptor antagonist are recommended for patients whose symptoms 
are mild or infrequent. 
Pantoprazole  belongs  to  the  class  of  proton  pump  inhibitors.  It  acts  by  inhibiting  the  secretion  of 
hydrochloric  acid  in  the  stomach  by  specific  blockade  of  the  proton  pumps  of  the  parietal  cells. 
Pantoprazole-containing products are currently licensed throughout the European community for the 
treatment  of  conditions  such  as  gastro-oesophageal  reflux  disease,  Zollinger-Ellison  syndrome,  acid 
reflux disease, dyspepsia and duodenal or gastric ulcers. It was first authorised in 1994 and is available 
as 20 mg and 40 mg tablets and as a lyophilised powder for injection. The supply status in all Member 
States  is  “prescription-only  medicine”  with  the  exception  of  Sweden  where  some  pack-sizes  of  the 
20 mg gastro-resistant tablets are supplied as non-prescription medicine. 
The objective of the current application for PANTOZOL Control is to seek approval for the short-term 
use  of  pantoprazole  orally  in  the  strength  of  20  mg  to  treat  reflux  symptoms  as  a  non-prescription 
medicine.  The  application  is  submitted  through  the  Centralised  Procedure  as  a  hybrid  application 
meaning that reference was made to an already approved product but that changes in the therapeutic

indication compared to the reference products were applied for supported by the results of appropriate 
nonclinical test or clinical trials. The reference product used for this purpose is Pantozol 20 mg gastro-
resistant  tablets  (Germany,  MA  number  43404.00.00),  which  is  approved  for  the  treatment  of  mild 
reflux  disease  and  associated  symptoms,  long-term  management  and  prevention  of  relapse  in  reflux 
oesophagitis, as well as the prevention of gastroduodenal ulcers induced by non-selective non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in patients at risk with a need for continuous NSAID treatment. 
There is no specific EMEA/CHMP guideline relevant for the proposed therapeutic indication. The EC 
Guideline on Changing the Classification for the Supply of a Medicinal Product for Human Use, in its 
current version (January 2006), is applicable for this application. EMEA/CHMP scientific advice with 
relevance for this particular development has not been obtained by the applicant. 
PANTOZOL  Control  is  available  in  film  coated  tablets  containing  20  mg  pantoprazole.  The 
recommended  dose  is  20 mg  pantoprazole  (one  tablet)  per  day.  Overall  treatment  duration  without 
consultation  of  a  doctor  is  limited  to  4 weeks;  if  no  symptom  relief  is  obtained  within  2 weeks  of 
continuous treatment, the patient should be instructed to consult a doctor. 
The  claimed  indication  at  time  of  application  read  as  follows:  “Treatment  of  reflux  symptoms  (e.g. 
heartburn, acid regurgitation)” 
The approved indication is: 
“Short-term treatment of reflux symptoms (e.g. heartburn, acid regurgitation) in adults.” 
2.2  Quality aspects 
Introduction 
PANTOZOL  Control  is  presented  in  form  of  gastro-resistant  tablets  containing  pantoprazole  as  an 
active substance. Each gastro-resistant tablet contains 20 mg pantoprazole (equivalent of 22.6 mg of 
pantoprazole  sodium  sesquihydrate).  Tablets  are  yellow,  oval,  biconvex,  film-coated  and  imprinted 
with “P20” in brown ink on one side.  
The  excipients  used  in  the  formulation  of  the  finished  product  are  well  known  excipients  used  for 
preparation  of  tablets  such  as  sodium  carbonate,  mannitol,  crospovidone,  povidone K90,  calcium 
stearate  (present  in  tablet  core),  hypromellose,  povidone  K25,  titanium  dioxide,  yellow  iron  oxide, 
methacrylic acid-ethyl  acrylate  copolymer  (1:1), sodium  laurilsulfate,  polysorbate  80,  triethyl  citrate 
(present  in  film-coating,  including  enteric  coating  and  undercoating),  shellac,  red  iron  oxide,  black 
iron  oxide,  yellow  iron  oxide,  soya  lecithin,  titanium  dioxide  and  antifoam  DC  1510  (present  in 
printing ink). 
Tablets  are  packed  in  Alu/Alu  blisters  without  cardboard  reinforcement  or  Alu/Alu  blisters  with 
cardboard reinforcement (blister wallet). 
Active Substance 
Pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate (recommended International Non-proprietary Name), a substituted 
benzimidazole, is a substance described in the Ph Eur. The active substance is chemically designated 
sulphinyl] 
as 
benzimidazol-1-ide sesquihydrate (Chemical Name) and has the following structure: 
5-(difluoromethoxy)-2-[(RS)-[(3,4-dimethoxypyridin- 
2-yl)methyl]

It is a white to off white ampholytic crystalline powder with pKa values of 3.92 and 8.19.  Is freely 
soluble in water and in ethanol (96%), practically insoluble in hexane. Solubility of the active is low at 
neutral pH, increasing with pH. Stable salts are only formed with bases, due to rapid conversion to the 
cyclic  sulphenamide  on  pyridyl  protonation.  Polymorphic  forms  have  not  been  detected,  although 
other hydrates can be formed. The water content is 5.9 - 6.9 % 
The  active  substance  can  exist  as  enantiomers  due  to  the  presence  of  an  unsymmetrical  substituted 
sulphoxide  group.  No  difference  has  been  found  in  the  in-vitro  or  in-vivo  activity  of  the  two 
enantiomers. 
•  Manufacture 
The  synthesis  of  the  drug  substance  is  performed  without  optically  active  reagents  and  results  in  a 
racemate.  It  involves  conventional  chemical  operations  (alkylation,  oxidation,  formation  of  salt), 
which were transferred from laboratory to production batches during the development. 
The manufacturing process of pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate is a four step synthesis. In the first 
(sul-
step  5-(difluoromethoxy)-2-{[(3,4-dimethoxypyridin-2-yl)methyl]thio}-1H-benz[d]imidazole) 
phide) is formed by a reaction of “Benzimidazole” and “Chloromethylpyridine” in alkylation reaction. 
In  the  step  2  this  intermediate  is  subsequently  converted  by  oxidation  to  5-(difluoromethoxy)-2-
{[(RS)-(3,4-dimethoxypyridin-2-yl)methyl]sulfin-yl}-1H-benz[d]imidazole  (free  acid).  Subsequently, 
in the next steps pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate is formed and isolated as pure active substance. 
The proposed manufacturing process has been adequately described, critical steps and accompanying 
in-process  controls  have  been  defined  to  ensure  quality  of  the  final  compound.  In-process  controls 
performed during the synthesis are suitable to control the reaction progress. Appropriate specifications 
for starting materials solvents and reagents have been established. 
The  synthesis  of  pantoprazole  sodium  sesquihydrate  for  commercial  purposes  was  developed  more 
than  ten  years  ago.  Process  initially  validated  at  smaller  scale  has  been  upscaled  and  transferred  to 
different  manufacturing  sites  where  the  process  was  adopted  to  the  equipment  of  these  sites  and 
validated  in  several  steps.  All  changes  during  the  development  have  been  well  characterised.  It  has 
been proven that the drug substance can be reproducibly manufactured. 
The  chemical  structure  of  pantoprazole  sodium  sesquihydrate  was  characterised  according  to  the 
identification  tests  described  in  the  Ph Eur  monograph.  All  the  relevant  characteristics  of  this 
substance are included in the monograph. 
Potential impurities and degradation products have been well discussed in relation to their origin and 
potential carry-over into the final drug substance. Solvents and heavy metals coming from a catalyst 
used in an early step of synthesis are routinely controlled.  
•  Specification 
The drug substance specification complies with the Ph Eur monograph. Additional test for particle size 
Page 7 of 35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and  residual  solvents  have  been  added.  The  drug  substance  specification  includes  tests  for 
identification  (IR  and  sodium),  appearance  of  solution,  optical  rotation,  water content  (Karl  Fisher),  
heavy metals, related substances (HPLC), assay (titration), particle size (laser diffraction) and residual 
solvents (GC).  
All analytical methods, except for particle size and residual solvents, are compendial and validation of 
these methods was not deemed necessary. For two additional methods (residual solvents, particle size 
distribution)  appropriate  validations  have  been  performed.  The  GC  method  has  been  adequately 
validated  for  selectivity,  linearity,  repeatability,  intermediate  precision,  accuracy,  limit  of  detection 
(LOD)  and  limit  of  quantitation  (LOQ).  Validation  for  the  particle  size  method  is  also  acceptable; 
repeatability, sensitivity and robustness were examined. 
In general analytical methods proposed are suitable to control the quality of the drug substance. 
Batch analysis data on 6 batches from the proposed manufacturing sites has been provided. All results 
are with specifications and show batch-to-batch and site-to-site consistency. 
•  Stability 
Stability  batches  were  stored  under  different  controlled  conditions  and  in  three  different  types  of 
packaging.  The  following  storage  conditions  and  duration  have  been  applied  during  the  studies: 
25 °C / 60% RH up to 60 months, 30 °C / 70% RH up to 36 months, 37 °C / 75% RH up to 20 months 
and 0 °C / 75% RH up to 6 months. The aim of these studies was to show evidence that the bulk drug 
substance  remains  stable  and  that the  use  of  different  containers for  transport  and  use in the central 
weighing system in one of the manufacturing sites has no negative influence on the quality of the drug 
substance. 
In addition photostability tests were performed according to the ICH "Guideline for the photostability 
testing  of  new  drug  substances  and  products".  Recent  studies  on  the  photostability  of  the  drug 
substance in solution and solid state, on stability against oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, HCl and sodium 
hydroxide  and  high  temperatures  were  also  presented.  The  main  degradation  pathway  has  been 
established through several stress condition studies in solid state and in solution.  
The stability studies confirmed the proposed re-test period, when the drug substance is stored in the 
proposed containers.  
Medicinal Product 
•  Pharmaceutical Development  
Pharmaceutical  development  of  the  finished  product  started  in  the  end  of  the  eighties;  the  first 
marketing authorization for an orally administered pantoprazole was granted in 1994. Gastro-resistant 
tablets  have  been  developed  in  order  to  protect  the  drug  substance  which  is  acid  labile  from  acidic 
effect of gastric fluid. Pantoprazole is a prodrug exerting its activity through the cyclic sulphenamide 
formed  by  the  action  of  acid  at  the  site  of  action.  It  inhibits  basal  and  stimulated  acid  secretion  in 
animals and man via the covalent binding H+/K+ ATP-ase, also known as the “gastric proton pump” 
located in the secretory membrane of the parietal cell. 
The drug substance is incompatible with all conventional gastro-resistant coating polymers, which are 
acidic. It was, therefore, necessary to seal the tablet core with an additional isolating layer of neutral 
coating  material  before  applying  the  gastro-resistant  coat.  Appropriate  compatibility  studies  of  the 
active substance with different excipients have been performed. Mannitol was chosen as a filler for the 
inner  phase  of  the  granulate,  polyvidone  as  a  binder,  crospovidone  as  a  disintegrant  and  sodium 
carbonate as an excipient empirically hindering discolouration of the active ingredient by increasing 
pH. Calcium stearate acts as a lubricant. Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose serves as a film former for 
the  subcoating.  The  other  excipients  are  propylene  glycol  as  a  plasticizer,  polyvidone  K25  as  an 
adhesion enhancer to promote the binding of the film to the tablet surface and yellow ferric oxide and

titanium dioxide as colorants. The gastro-resistant coating consists of methacrylic acid - ethyl acrylate 
copolymer 1:1; triethyl citrate is added as a plasticizer. 
•  Adventitious Agents 
Among excipients used in the drug product only shellac, component of the printing ink is of animal 
origin  but  without  any  TSE/BSE  risk.  Shellac  is  obtained  by  purification  of  Lac,  a  secretion  of  the 
insect Laccifer Lacca Kerr (Coccidae). 
•  Manufacture of the Product 
The manufacturing process has been applied unchanged over the recent years. It is divided into three 
manufacturing steps (1) manufacturing of the tablet cores, (2) coating and (3) printing and packaging 
of the gastro-resistant tablets. Tablet cores are produced by wet granulation.  In the second phase of 
the  process  the  first  coating  suspension  is  sprayed  onto  the  tablets  in  two  phases.  The  spraying  is 
continued until the nominal tablet weight has been achieved and the cores are dried in an interim step. 
Tablets  cores  covered  with  subcoating  are  subsequently  covered  with  the  second  coating  layer  – 
enteric coating. Spraying continues until the nominal tablet weight increase has been achieved and the 
coated  tablets  are  dried.  In  the  final  step  the  gastro-resistant  tablets  are  printed on  one  side  [“P20”] 
with brown printing ink using an offset printing machine. The printed tablets are put into the container 
closure systems. 
The  manufacturing  process  is  fully  validated  according  to  GMP  requirements.  Extensive  experience 
over the years demonstrates that the manufacturing process is well under control and a drug product of 
adequate quality within the approved specifications is obtained. A continuously high level of quality 
can therefore be guaranteed. 
•  Product Specification 
The  product  specification  is  standard  for  tablets  (modified  release)  and  contains  tests  with  suitable 
limits for appearance, mean mass, disintegration time, loss on drying, identification, dissolution (UV 
determination),  content  uniformity,  assay  (HPLC),  purity  -  impurities  and  degradation  products 
(HPLC), microbial limits. 
Analytical  methods  have  been  adequately  described  and  validated  for  the  intended  use.  The  assay, 
identification  and  related  substances  are  determined  by  an  in-house  HPLC  method.  The  dissolution 
test is the same as the one used during drug development. The other tests are carried out according to 
the  Ph Eur.  The  HPLC  method  for  assay,  identity  and  purity  has  been  validated  with  respect  to 
specificity, limit of detection, limit of quantitation, selectivity, linearity, range, precision, accuracy and 
robustness.  The  UV  method  for  determination  of  dissolution  percentage  has  been  validated  with 
respect to specificity, linearity, precision and accuracy.  
Batch analysis results on commercial scale batches of the drug product indicate satisfactory uniformity 
and compliance with the agreed specification. 
•  Stability of the Product 
Over  the  long  experience  with  the  drug  product  significant  changes  have  never  been  encountered, 
when  testing  the  dosage  form  in  long-term  stability  studies  as  well  as  under  accelerated  conditions 
according to the ICH Q1A. Furthermore bulk stability for the gastro-resistant tablets were submitted to 
guarantee stability prior to further processing. 
Supportive stability studies were performed after approval on three commercial scale batches stored 
up  to  36  months  under  the  following  conditions  25 °C  /  60 %  RH  (long  term),  30 °C  / 70   % RH 
(intermediate) and 40 °C / 75 % RH (accelerated). The tablets stored in primary packaging materials 
as  described  in  the  dossier  were  in  compliance  with  the  shelf-life  specifications  at  all  tested  time 
points.  
Page 9 of 35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In  addition  as  per  GMP  requirements  the  applicant  committed  to  place  on  the  stability  study  one 
commercial  scale  batch  of  the  drug  product  per  year,  chosen  irrespective  of  the  primary  packaging 
material, on follow-up stability at 25°C/60 % RH. 
Based  on  the  stability  data  the  proposed  shelf-life  and  storage  conditions  as  defined  in  the  SPC  are 
acceptable. 
In summary the stability data provided support the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions. 
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information  on  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  drug  substance  and  drug  product  has 
been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance. 
2.3 
Non-clinical aspects 
The applicant provided an acceptable summary of the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology 
of  pantoprazole  based  on  published  literature  as  well  as  reference  books  and  information  from 
databases. No further non-clinical studies are required and the applicant has justified why no such data 
were provided. 
Since the manufacturing of the product is identical to the reference product, there is no requirement to 
specifically address the impurity profile of the new product from a nonclinical perspective.  
For  the  environmental  risk  assessment,  the  applicant  has  conducted  the  following  studies:  Ready 
biodegradability  (OECD  301  D),  Aerobic  Transformation  in  Water  (OECD  308),  Respiration 
Inhibition  Test  (OECD  209),  Daphnia  immobilisation  (OECD  202),  Daphnia  reproduction  Test 
(OECD 211), Acute Toxicity to Fish (OECD 203), Fish Early Life Stage Toxicity Test (OECD 210) 
and  Algae  Growth  Inhibition  Test  (OECD  201).  In  addition,  the  applicant  has  initiated  a  sediment-
water chironomid toxicity test using spiked Sediment (OECD 218). The final report of this study will 
be provided as post-approval commitment together with a discussion on the impact of this data on the 
environmental risk assessment.  
2.4 
Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
This being a hybrid application refers to the approved product Pantozol 20 mg gastro-resistant tablets 
and concerns a change in the indication for use as non-prescription medicine. Appropriate clinical data 
in support of the proposed change is required. 
To support the efficacy of PANTOZOL control in the proposed indication and posology, the data from 
17 clinical  studies  was  provided  in  which  the  treatment  of  symptoms  in  patients  with  GORD  was 
studied  as  primary  or  secondary  criterion.  In  these  studies  the  use  of  pantoprazole  20  mg  in  the 
symptomatic  treatment  of  GORD  of  any  stage  within  the  first  14  days  of  treatment  has  been 
investigated. Out of these studies, studies BGSA017 and BGI022 comparing pantoprazole to placebo 
and  ranitidine,  respectively,  after  2  weeks  of  treatment  were  considered  as  main  studies  for  the 
claimed indication. Table 1 provides an overview of key design elements of the main studies.

For the safety evaluation a review derived from the applicant’s worldwide clinical trial database and 
post-marketing surveillance data together with a risk-benefit consideration for non-prescription status 
have been provided.  
The applied for medicinal product and the reference product are from a quality perspective identical in 
terms of qualitative and quantitative composition, and manufacturing sites and processes are identical. 
Therefore, no bioequivalence data between the two products were required.  
GCP 
The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. The applicant 
has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried 
out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Pharmacokinetics 
No new pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in support of this application and full reference was 
made to the available data for the reference product. This was considered acceptable. 
The  applicant  has  reviewed  the  available  literature  data  on  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  of 
pantoprazole.  The  absolute  bioavailability  of  pantoprazole  in  healthy  subjects  is  77%  and  does  not 
change  at  multiple  dosing.  Unlike  other  proton  pump  inhibitors,  pantoprazole  has  linear 
pharmacokinetics in a dose range of 10 - 80mg.  It is extensively metabolised in the liver. The main 
serum  metabolite  is  formed  by  demethylation  at  the  4-position  of  the  pyridine  ring,  followed  by 
conjugation  with  sulphate.  80%  of  the  administered  dose  excretes  as  metabolites  in  the  urine.  The 
pharmacokinetics is unaltered in patients with renal failure. In patients with severe liver cirrhosis, the 
half-live,  AUC  and  maximum  serum  concentration  are  increased.  Since  the  elimination  half-life  in 
these patients is still shorter than the dosing interval of 24 hours, no accumulation of pantoprazole was 
observed following multiple dosing. Since in patients with liver cirrhosis the elimination half-life, the 
AUC and the maximum serum concentration is increased compared to healthy subjects, patients with 
Page 11 of 35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
liver disease should not be supplied with non-prescription pantoprazole without consulting a doctor. 
This is adequately addressed in section 4.4 of the SPC and section 2 of the package Leaflet. 
No  dose  adjustment  is  required  in  the  elderly.  Concomitant  intake  of  food  has  no  influence  on  the 
bioavailability of pantoprazole. 
Pantoprazole  has  a  low  interaction  potential.  The  results  of  several  pharmacokinetic  studies  with 
pantoprazole  and  different  drug  combinations  do  not  suggest  drug-drug  interaction  between 
pantoprazole and the tested drugs. There are potential interactions with anticoagulants and with drugs, 
which  bioavailability  is  pH  dependent  such  as  atanazavir.  The  co-administration  with  atazanavir  is 
contra-indicated in the SPC and the Package Leaflet. 
Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were conducted in support of this application and full reference was 
made to the available data for the reference product. This was considered acceptable. 
The applicant has provided a literature review on pharmacodynamics. Pantoprazole inhibits the gastric 
H+/K+-ATPase (the  proton  pump)  and  thereby  inhibits  H+  ion  transfer into  the  gastric  lumen.  Like 
other  compounds  in  its  class,  pantoprazole  becomes  active  only  after  chemical  rearrangement  in  a 
strongly  acidic  environment.  During  the  first  step  of  the  chemical  transformation  pantoprazole  is 
protonated, assuming a positive charge. The second step of the activation involves rearrangement of 
the  molecular  structure  into  a  cyclic  sulphenamide,  a  highly  reactive  intermediate  of  pantoprazole 
which  can  form  disulphide  (S-S)  bonds  with  cysteine-containing  proteins  (or  S-H  group  containing 
compounds such as glutathione), and thereby affects their structural and/or functional properties. 
Treatment  with  oral  doses  of  pantoprazole  once  daily  leads  to  a  dose-related  increase  in  the  24  h 
intragastric  pH  and  in  the  concentration  of  serum  gastrin.  The  effects  of  the  20  mg  dose  are 
significantly lower than those observed with the 40 mg dose, but higher doses (80 mg and 120 mg) do 
not differ much from the 40 mg dose. The effect increases with dose and over time and reaches steady 
state  after  a  few  days.  Tablet  and  i.v.  formulations  of  pantoprazole  have  equipotent  effect  on 
intragastric pH. Compared to ranitidine, pantoprazole is significantly more effective in elevating and 
maintaining  intragastric  pH.  These  pharmacodynamic  characteristics  are  in  line  with  findings  from 
clinical  trials  submitted  by  the  applicant,  which  show  that  pantoprazole  20  mg  is  effective  for  the 
treatment of reflux-like symptoms, but it does not provide instant relief of symptoms. 
Clinical efficacy  
The proof of efficacy is based on a comprehensive assessment of the data from 17 clinical studies that 
were identified for this purpose, two of which were considered the main studies. 
•  Dose response studies 
No  specific  dose  finding  studies  have  been  conducted  for  this  application.  Based  on  the  available 
clinical study data, the applicant considered a daily dose of pantoprazole 20 mg to be established for 
the short-term (up to 2/4 weeks) treatment of reflux symptoms. These studies compare pantoprazole 
20 mg with placebo, histamine2-receptor antagonist or proton pump inhibitors. No comparison with 
histamine2-receptor  antagonist  at  doses  used  for  non-prescription  treatment  of  heartburn  has  been 
performed. 
The  CHMP  asked  the  applicant  to  explore  whether  doses  of  pantoprazole  below  20  mg  (namely 
10 mg)  can  be  effective  in  the  proposed  indication.  One  study  has  been  identified  by  the  applicant, 
which  studies  the  10  mg  pantoprazol  dose  to  investigate  healing  of  erosive  esophagitis.  This  study 
(WA300)  includes  the  absence  of  reflux  symptoms  as  a  secondary  endpoint.  Three  doses  of 
pantoprazole (10, 20 and 40 mg) were compared to placebo. A detailed analysis of the results of this 
study shows that the 20 mg dose obtained a more consistent profile of relief at earlier time points. The 
10 mg dose achieved statistically significant results compared to placebo in the rates of patients with 
Page 12 of 35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
persistent  absence  of  daytime  and  night-time  heartburn  but  a  statistically  significant  result  in 
persistence of acid regurgitation is not obtained with this dose. The efficacy and safety of the 20 mg 
dose  subject  to  medical  prescription  in  the  treatment  of  mild  reflux  disease  and  its  symptoms  is 
acknowledged. The CHMP therefore agreed that the selection of this dose for the proposed indication 
of the non-prescription medicine is justified. 
•  Main studies 
Two studies were considered as the main studies for the claimed indication:  
-  Study  BGSA017  was  a  randomized,  double-blind,  multicentre,  parallel  group  comparison 
conducted at 10 study centres in South Africa; 
-  Study  BGI022  was  randomized,  double-blind,  parallel  group  conducted  at  45  study  centres  in 
Italy. 
Selection  of  the  main  studies  was  based  on  the  criteria  that  relief  of  reflux-related  symptoms  was 
defined as the primary efficacy criterion in the study protocol and that the primary efficacy analysis 
was based on the time point of 14 days of treatment (with or without an additional time point at 7 days 
of treatment). 
Study BGSA017 
METHODS 
Study Participants  
Patients in this study were between 18 and 75 years old and had a normal oesophagus on endoscopy. 
They  had  a  history  of  reflux  symptoms  (heartburn,  acid  eructation,  pain  on  swallowing)  for  at  least 
3 months  prior  to  entry  into  the  study,  and  at  least  one  episode  of  heartburn  of  at  least  moderate 
intensity on all three days prior to inclusion into the study. Patients with conditions for whom a non-
prescription use of pantoprazole would not be appropriate, like patients with current erosive lesions of 
the upper gastrointestinal tract (e.g. reflux esophagitis stage I-V, erosive gastritis, were excluded. 
Treatments 
One group of patients received 20mg pantoprazole every morning before breakfast. The other group of 
patients took one tablet containing placebo. At the first visit and at the follow-up visit after 7 days the 
patients received 10 film coated tablets of 20mg pantoprazole or placebo. The maximum duration of 
treatment per patient was 2 weeks.  
Objectives 
The objective of the study was to compare the symptom relief and tolerability of 20mg pantoprazole 
(once daily dose) with placebo in the treatment of symptomatic GORD in patients with endoscopically 
normal oesophagus. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy parameter was freedom from heartburn after 7 and 14 days defined as being free 
from heartburn for 2 days prior to the first and second follow-up visits. 
Secondary  efficacy  parameter  was  time  until  freedom  from  key  symptoms  (heartburn,  acid 
regurgitation, pain on swallowing). 
Page 13 of 35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sample size 
The sample size was calculated on the basis that for 100 patients in each group a difference of 26% in 
time  until  freedom  of  symptoms  can  be  detected  assuming  clinical  response  rates  around  50%  (i.e. 
37%; 63%). This was calculated for a one sided test at the 2.5% level of significance and a power of 
90% (leading to 98 patients per group). 
Randomisation 
Randomisation  was  based  on  a  computer-generated  list  of  pseudo  random  numbers.  The  random 
sequence was balanced after every 4 patients (block length). 
Blinding (masking) 
Test product and placebo tablets were of identical appearance, and were packed in identical bottles and 
cartons. 
Statistical methods 
With respect to the primary criteria ‘freedom from heartburn after 7 days’ and freedom from heartburn 
after  14  days’  the  two  treatment  groups  were  compared  by  means  of  Fisher’s  Exact  Test.  The  null 
hypothesis that no difference in efficacy exists between the two treatments was tested one-sided versus 
the  alternative  that  such  a  difference  exists  (superiority  of  pantoprazole).  The  multiple  level  of 
significance was set to 5%, and an appropriate sample size was chosen to achieve a power of 90%.

the pantoprazole  group  and  40  years (range: 19-73  years) in  the  placebo  group.  Median  weight  was 
comparable between treatment groups (74.5 kg vs. 75 kg). 
The distribution of gender, H. pylori status, consumption of nicotine and alcohol was comparable in 
the two treatment groups.  
Numbers analysed 
In the intention to treat (ITT) evaluation all patients were included who had taken the study medication 
at  least  once.  The  ITT  population  included  219  patients.  All  patients  who  completed  the  study 
according  to  the  protocol were included  in  the  per  protocol  analysis  (PP).  Drop  outs  due  to  adverse 
events  whose  causality  to  the  study  medication  was  assessed  as  ‘likely’  or  ‘definite’  by  the 
investigator  and failures  of  treatment  were  included  in  the  PP  analysis.  The  PP  population  included 
211 patients by the end of week 1 and 204 patients by the end of week 2. 
Outcomes and estimation 
The  results  of  this  study  are  summarized  in the  tables  below. The  differences  between  pantoprazole 
and placebo in the relief from heartburn (table 2) were statistically significant at 1 and 2 weeks in both 
the intent-to-treat and per protocol populations (p<0.001, Fisher’s Exact Test).

48% of the PP patients in the pantoprazole group and 26% of PP patients in the placebo group. The 
difference between the treatment groups was statistically significant (p<0.001). 
No obvious difference in therapeutic response was observed in H. pylori negative vs positive patients.

Study BGI022 
METHODS 
Study Participants  
Patients in this study were at least 18 years old and had heartburn of at least moderate intensity for at 
least the previous 3 months. Patients had to have experienced heartburn of moderate to severe intensity 
on each of the three days prior to the first visit. Heartburn was defined as burning feeling rising from 
the stomach or lower chest up towards the neck. An inclusion criterion was also endoscopic evidence 
of either reflux oesophagitis (stage I according to the Savary-Miller classification) or no oesophagitis. 
Patients with conditions for whom a non-prescription use of pantoprazole would not be appropriate, 
like patients with endoscopically diagnosed reflux oesophagitis either of stage II, III or IV according 
to the Savary/Miller classification, were excluded. 
Treatments 
Eligible patients were randomized to receive a 4-week treatment with either pantoprazole 20mg once a 
day (taken in the morning before breakfast) plus one ranitidine placebo tablet in the morning before 
breakfast  and  in  the  evening  before  bedtime  or  ranitidine  150mg  one  tablet  in  the  morning  before 
breakfast  and  in  the  evening  before  bedtime  plus  one  pantoprazole  placebo  tablet  in  the  morning 
before breakfast.  
Objectives 
The  study  objective  was  to  compare  the  efficacy  and  tolerability  of  pantoprazole  and  ranitidine  in 
patients with mild GORD (no oesophagitis or stage I oesophagitis according to Savary/Miller). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary  outcome was  to  demonstrate  superiority  of  pantoprazole  over  ranitidine  in  the  absence  of 
heartburn during the 3 days prior to the first visit (after 14 +-3 days of treatment). 
The  secondary  outcome  was  to  assess  the  effects  of  pantoprazole  and  ranitidine  in  the  following 
variables: 
- 
absence  of  heartburn  during  the  3  days  prior  to  the  second  visit  (after  28  days  ±3  days  of 
treatment) 
safety and tolerability 
influence of H.pylori status on efficacy 
symptomatic improvement after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment, judged by a symptom score  
- 
- 
- 
Sample size 
In  a  previous  study  freedom  from  the  key  symptoms  were  69%  and  48%  with  pantoprazole  and 
ranitidine,  respectively.  Assuming  similar  symptom  relief  rates,  a  0.05  two-sided  significance  level 
and  using  a  Fisher’s  Exact  Test  as  an  approximation  for  the  procedure  described  above,  for  N=160 
patients per group, the power was estimated to be 96%. The plan was to recruit 380 patients in order to 
have 320 patients eligible for the per protocol evaluation to assess the superiority of pantoprazole over 
ranitidine. 
Randomisation 
Allocation  of  patients  to  treatment  groups  occurred  on  the  basis  of  a  computer-generated 
randomization  list.  A  balanced  block  randomization  was  used,  so  that  the  total  number  of  patients 
allocated to the two treatments was balanced.

Blinding (masking) 
To make the two treatment schemes indistinguishable the double-dummy technique was adopted. 
Statistical methods 
The full analysis set included all patients who were randomized and received trial medication at least 
once. The per-protocol set  included all  patients of the  full  analysis  set  except those  who  fulfilled  at 
least one of the major protocol violations. All patients who received at least one study medication dose 
were included into the safety analysis. 
All demographic and baseline variables were described by statistical characteristics. Efficacy analysis 
was performed both on the intention to treat and per-protocol data sets. Null hypothesis was that the 
two treatment groups had similar relief rates in the heartburn symptoms. Alternative hypothesis stated 
that the two rates were statistically different. The level of significance adopted was 0.05 and the test 
power was 90% for a two-tailed test.  
Main  variable  (absence  of  heartburn  during  the  three  days  prior  to  the  first  visit)  was  analysed  by 
means of Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method including the initial stage of oesophagitis as a covariate. 
The  absence  of  heartburn  during  the  three  days  prior  to  the  second  visit  was  analysed  by  using 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  method,  using  H.pylori  at  baseline  as  a  covariate.  A  logistic  regression 
model  was  performed  on  the  rates  of  therapeutic  success.  Descriptive  statistics  were  performed  for 
symptom scores and for adverse events.

Baseline data 
There were 159 male and 202 female patients included. There were no important differences between 
the treatment groups in terms of sex and age. The proportion of patients who were overweight or obese 
was  slightly  higher  in  the pantoprazole  group  than  in  the  ranitidine  group  (44.8%  vs.  37.64%). The 
treatment groups were similar in terms of smoking and drinking habits: the majority of patients were 
non-smokers and non-alcohol users. Endoscopic findings were abnormal in 64.54% in the whole study 
population. H. pylori was found in 31.56% in patients. 
Numbers analysed 
180 patients were included in the safety analysis in the pantoprazole group and 178 in the ranitidine 
group. The ITT population included 344 patients (172 in each group) and the PP population included 
277 patients (140 in the pantoprazole and 137 in the ranitidine group). 
Outcomes and estimation 
The rates of complete relief of heartburn at days 14 and 28 are presented in table 4. The differences 
between the treatment groups in the relief of heartburn were statistically significant in both the intent-
to-treat and per-protocol populations at Day 14 (p < 0.05). At Day 28 heartburn relief observed with 
pantoprazole was higher than with ranitidine, but the differences were not significant (p=0.079 ITT, 
and p=0.088 PP, respectively).

Heartburn improved in most patients. Worsening of heartburn (from moderate to severe) was observed 
only  in  2  patients  in  the  ITT  population.  The  logistic  regression  analysis  showed  that  neither  the 
presence of reflux oesophagitis nor the positivity for H. pylori had a significant impact on relief from 
heartburn  at  visit  one  (p=0.813  for  reflux  oesophagitis  and  p=0.847  for  H.  pylori),  while  at  visit  2 
positivity for H. pylori (p=0.026) was a significant factor, but reflux oesophagitis is not (p=0.473)  
Results for the relief of acid regurgitation are shown in table 5. The success rate was similar in patients 
treated  for  more  than  17  days  and  in  patients  treated  between  11  and  17  days  in  the  pantoprazole 
group, while the success rate was slightly lower with longer treatment in the ranitidine group.

These  studies  showed  that  pantoprazole  20mg  was  superior  to  placebo  and  histamine2-receptor 
antagonist in the complete relief from heartburn and was non-inferior to other proton pump inhibitors. 
The results also show an early onset of the clinical effect, with rates of complete relief of heartburn 
between  54.0%  and  80.6%  achieved  after  7  days  of  treatment  with  pantoprazole  20  mg.  A  further 
improvement  in  the  symptom  relief  rates  was  observed  after  14  days  and  28  days  of  treatment, 
respectively.  
The  evaluation  of  the  symptom  acid  regurgitation  showed  similar  rates  of  complete  relief  as  the 
symptom heartburn at 7, 14, and 28 days.  
Daily doses of pantoprazole 40 mg and 80 mg showed higher symptom relief rates than pantoprazole 
20  mg,  but  non-inferiority  was  concluded  in  the  majority  of  studies  and  at  most  time  points.  These 
results  support  the  selection  of  the  20  mg  daily  dose  of  pantoprazole  in  the  treatment  of  reflux 
symptoms.  
Most patients with reflux symptoms have no or only mild erosive reflux disease. However, in the non-
prescription setting the presence of oesophageal erosions cannot be ruled out because treatment will be 
performed without prior endoscopic examination. Therefore, the efficacy of pantoprazole 20 mg in the 
relief of reflux symptoms depending on endoscopically determined GORD stages was evaluated in the 
study set selected for the present application. The results show that symptom relief rates are largely 
independent  of  the  initial  GORD  stage  of  the  patients.  Only  for  the  symptom  heartburn,  symptom 
relief  rates  were  somewhat  higher  in  Group  1  in  comparison  to  Group  0  (NERD)  patients  and  a 
decrease in the symptom relief rates with higher stages of erosive GORD was observed. Altogether, 
differences between GORD stage groups were small. These results provide reassurance that patients 
using  pantoprazole  in  a  non-prescription  setting  will  benefit  from  symptom  relief  during  short-term 
treatment with pantoprazole without diagnostic endoscopy prior to treatment. 
Out of the 15 supportive studies, the results of study FK3059 are of particular interest for the intended 
non-prescription  use  of  pantoprazole.  In  this  trial,  patients  were  entered  based  on  the  presence  of 
reflux symptoms without endoscopic examination. Therefore, with regard to the inclusion criteria, the 
patient population in this study closely resembles the intended patient population for non-prescription 
pantoprazole. The study was a double-blind comparison of pantoprazole 20 mg and ranitidine 300 mg 
once  daily  in  patients  with  reflux-related  symptoms  (heartburn,  acid  regurgitation  or  pain  on 
swallowing) of at least ‘rather severe’ intensity on a 7-point Likert Scale. The results of the study are 
presented in table 8. The differences between the treatment groups were statistically significant.

Clinical safety 
•  Patient exposure 
During drug development more than 250 clinical studies on pantoprazole tablets have been carried out 
in about 80,500 patients. In most studies daily doses ranged from 20 to 80 mg; however, in particular 
settings higher doses up to 320 mg p.o. and 240 mg i.v. were given. The applicant considers that 94 of 
these clinical studies involving 26,615 patients are relevant to the safety aspect of this application.

From  the  first  launch  of  pantoprazole  733,000  pantoprazole  treatment  courses  were  documented  in 
Post-Authorisation  Safety  Studies.  These  studies,  which  reflect  the  use  of  the  product  in  medical 
practice  as  compared  to  the  scientific  setting  of  clinical  studies  with  strict  inclusion  and  exclusion 
criteria, contributed to the safety profile of pantoprazole. 
The  worldwide  post-marketing  patient  exposure  based  on  sales  data  is  approximately  665  million 
patients.

Adverse  drug  reactions  reported  from  Post-Authorisation  Safety  Studies  showed  similar  patterns  to 
adverse drug reactions from clinical studies. No new adverse drug reactions, or an increased frequency 
of known adverse drug reactions, or any other risk that might affect the safe use of the drug has been 
detected in Post-Authorisation Safety Studies.

A case-controlled study on Clostridium difficile associated diarrhoea based on the UK GPRD database 
showed that 12% of the cases had a history of GORD. However, this is not considered representative 
for the general population. 
•  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The most frequently reported serious adverse events with pantoprazole in clinical trials were surgery, 
chest  pain,  injury  and  abdominal  pain.  With  regard  to  serious  adverse  events  for  which  causality  to 
pantoprazole was assessed as related by the investigator, 41 events were reported (18 of these from the 
SOC  ‘gastrointestinal  disorders’).  Serious  adverse  drug  reactions  have  therefore  been  rare.  Among 
serious adverse events assessed as related to pantoprazole, the most frequently reported events were 
diarrhoea, abdominal pain, headache, nausea, chest pain, and rash. 
Thirteen patients died in the clinical trials among the pantoprazole-treated population. All these cases 
with fatal outcome were finally assessed by the investigator as ‘unrelated’ to pantoprazole. 
•  Safety in special populations 
Clinical  trials  have  been  performed  in  special  patient  populations,  such  as  children,  the  elderly  and 
renal-  or  liver-impaired  patients.  With  regard  to  the  latter,  no  adverse  events  have  been  reported  in 
patients  with  liver  cirrhosis,  and  most  adverse  events  reported  among  patients  with  hepatic 
impairment,  including  changes  in  laboratory  results  or  vital  signs  were  considered  unrelated  to 
pantoprazole.  With  regard  to  elderly  or  renal-impaired  patients,  special  safety  and  pharmacokinetic 
studies showed that pantoprazole was safe, and that no dose adjustment was necessary.  
Treatment of children is not intended in the present application in the non-prescription setting. Clinical 
trial data did not indicate any specific safety issue in this patient population and the oral prescription-
only product is approved for adolescent patients. 
•  Post marketing experience 
The applicant has conducted an overall analysis of post-marketing data. Overall, 11,153 case reports 
have been received with 20,697 associated adverse event terms; 1,599 cases (14.3%) were regarded as 
serious;  the  serious  reports  comprised  3,793  associated  terms,  of  which  2,982  were  serious  adverse 
events.  
Considering the most frequently reported adverse events and serious adverse events overall, the most 
affected  system  organ  class  was  ‘gastrointestinal  disorders’  (30%  of  all  adverse  events).  Further 
affected  system  organ  classes  included  mainly  ‘nervous  system  disorders’,  ‘General  disorders  and 
administration  site  conditions’,  ‘skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders’,  and  ‘investigations’.  The 
most  frequent  adverse  events  (≥5%)  included  diarrhoea,  headache,  and  nausea.  These  findings  are 
consistent with the information collected in the clinical trial setting. 
During the post-marketing period, 1,314 reports of unlisted serious adverse drug reactions have been 
received worldwide. The analysis of these serious unlisted adverse drug reaction cases did not point to 
any new safety concern with regard to pantoprazole treatment.  
123  cases  of  death  were  recorded  during  the  post-marketing  period.  Seven  deaths  were  assessed  as 
having a ‘possible’ relation to the drug. They included six patients who suffered from toxic epidermal 
necrolysis (TEN), and one patient with Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS).  
During the post-marketing period 91 cases with drug exposure during pregnancy has been reported. In 
43 cases the outcome was a normal baby. Although spontaneous abortions and premature births did 
not  occur  with  higher  frequency,  because animal  studies have  shown reproductive  toxicity  (signs  of 
slight fetotoxicity were observed at doses above 5 mg/kg), patients are advised not to use pantoprazole 
during pregnancy. There were five post-marketing reports concerning lactating women, none of which 
resulted in a safety concern.

No  increased  risk  of  the  treatment  with  pantoprazole  in  patients  with  renal  impairment  or  impaired 
liver function has been detected in the post-marketing period. 
2.5 
Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
legislative requirements. 
Risk Management Plan 
The  CHMP  did  not  require  the  MAA  to  submit  a  risk  management  plan  because  of  the  long  safety 
record  in  Europe  since  1994,  its  large  patient  user  base  as  well  as  the  product’s  wide  therapeutic 
window.  The  application  is  based  on  a  reference  medicinal  product  for  which  no  safety  concerns 
requiring  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  have  been  identified.  The  20-mg  strength,  which  is 
intended for the non-prescription market, has been widely used in the prescription-only setting and it is 
considered that the use in the proposed indication without a medical prescription does not mandate a 
risk management plan.  
The PSUR submission schedule for PANTOZOL Control 20 mg gastro-resistant tablets should follow 
the PSUR submission schedule of the reference medicinal product. 
2.6 
Legal Status 
The  applicant  requested  the  supply  of  the  medicinal  product  to  be  classified  as  non  prescription 
medicine meaning that the criteria of Article 71 of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, do not apply. 
For the assessment of this request, the criteria as laid down in the Commission Guideline on Changing 
the Classification for the Supply of a Medicinal Product for Human Use are being applied. 
•  Direct danger 
Pantoprazole has been available on prescription for 14 years and its safety profile is well documented. 
There  are  no  direct  safety  issues  that  preclude  pantoprazole  being  available  as  a  non-prescription 
medicine. The product information warns against the use of pantoprazole in certain conditions such as 
pregnancy and with certain other medications such as oral anticoagulants.   
Additional  information  on  the  available  safety  data  from  Sweden  where  pantoprazole  20mg  is 
available non-prescription were provided. Between 01 February 2000 and 12 December 2007 3 cases 
concerning the intake of 20 mg pantoprazole and 3 cases with unknown dosage of pantoprazole have 
been  spontaneously  reported.  Five  cases  were  serious/labelled  and  recovered  without  sequelae.  One 
case was serious/unlabelled and recovered without sequelae. Acknowledging a potentially significant 
under-reporting, there is no evidence that non-prescription supply in Sweden raised any concerns over 
the  issue  of  incorrect  self-assessment.  The  available  evidence  provided  does  not  suggest  that  non-
prescription supply of pantoprazole alters the known safety profile of this product.  
• 
Indirect danger 
Indirect  danger  may  arise  by  masking  any  serious  underlying  conditions  such  as  an  upper 
gastrointestinal  tumour  or  myocardial  infarction  if  the  patient  erroneously  assesses  his  or  her 
symptoms  (with  the  help  of  the  pharmacist  as  appropriate)  as  caused  by  gastro-oesophageal  reflux. 
However,  patients  with  alarming  symptoms  indicative  of  gastrointestinal  malignancy  (such  as 
unintentional  weight  loss,  bleeding,  dysphagia,  abdominal  pain  etc.)  will  normally  see  a  physician. 
Additionally,  patients  with  symptoms  related  to  conditions  other  than  GORD  will  not  experience 
Page 27 of 35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
improvement after 2 weeks of treatment or they will need longer than 4-week treatment and therefore 
will  see  a  doctor.  Symptoms  of  myocardial  infarction  are  usually  serious  and  develop  suddenly. 
Patients  with  new  symptoms  will  be  referred  to  a  doctor.  Additionally,  non-prescription  supply  of 
pantoprazole  will  be  indicated  for  patients  with  reflux-like  symptoms  described  as  heartburn  and 
regurgitation.  Patients  with  chest  pain  will  be  excluded  from  non-prescription  supply.  Appropriate 
advice  to  minimise  the  risk  for  an  indirect  danger  will  be  included  in  the  package  leaflet  so  that 
patients will be able to follow this guidance without involvement of the pharmacist. 
Based  on  the  available  information  regarding  potential  serious  underlying  conditions  together  with 
adequate product information it is considered that indirect danger is minimal. 
•  Self-assessment 
It is acknowledged that a patient’s first contact with a healthcare professional for GORD symptoms is 
typically  during  a  visit  of  the  pharmacy.  The  initial  GORD  treatment  is  symptom-based  rather  than 
pathogenesis-based.  Proton  pump  inhibitors  are  often  prescribed  as  first-line  treatment  for  GORD. 
Products  for  the  treatment  of  reflux-like  symptoms  are  available  over-the-counter  in  a  number  of 
countries worldwide where patients’ ability to self-select OTC medicines for GORD is accepted.  
Actual  use  studies  showed  that  around  80%  of  patients  are  able  to  self-select  non-prescription 
medication  for  reflux-symptoms  correctly.  The  results  of  a  published  study  conducted  in  the  US 
showed that a high proportion of patients self-selected omeprazole correctly1. Among those who did 
not  meet  the  non-prescription  inclusion  criteria,  9.5%  had  contraindicated  symptoms.  However,  the 
majority of these patients consulted a doctor and none of them used the study medication longer than 
14 days. No further information on the contraindicated symptoms or the consequences of the treatment 
is available. There were only 2% of patients who took the study medication longer than 4 weeks. The 
majority of subjects who took the study medication longer contacted a healthcare professional, which 
is reassuring. 
•  Risk and consequences of incorrect use  
There  are  no  concerns  in  relation  to  incorrect  use  or  intentional  misuse.  Additionally,  the  proposed 
small pack size minimises the risk for abuse or misuse. 
•  Patient information 
The package leaflet and the labelling are considered adequate to contribute effectively to the safe and 
effective use of the medicine including appropriate guarding that the non-prescription medicine is not 
used  where  it  is  contraindicated  or  unsafe.  The  written  information  clearly  expresses  when  the 
medicinal  product  should  not  be  used.  A  user  testing  of  the  package  leaflet  has  been  performed  in 
accordance with the legislation. 
The  available  experience  with  pantoprazole  20  mg  orally  is  considered  sufficient  for  assessing  the 
proposed non-prescription status, and the documented use relevant for the proposed indication and age 
group  of  PANTOZOL  Control.  Overall,  the  CHMP  considers  that  the  supply  as  non-prescription 
medicine  is  appropriate.  It  is  noted  that  specific  aspects  of  the  national  implementation  of  a  non-
prescription status vary amongst Member States. 
2.7 
Data exclusivity 
With reference to Article 74a of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, the applicant requested one year 
data  exclusivity  for  the  data  submitted  for  the  change  of  the  classification  of  the  medicinal  product 
1  FENDRICK  AM  et  al.,  Self-Selection  and  Use  Patterns  of  Over-the-Counter  Omeprazole  for  Frequent 
Heartburn, Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology 2004;2:17–21

from prescription to non-prescription. Such exclusivity requires that the change of classification “has 
been authorised on the basis of significant preclinical tests or clinical trials”. 
The justification of the applicant was based on 6 ‘non-published’ studies, 5 full and one published by 
abstract  only,  which  have  been  provided  in  support  of  the  application  (BY1023/BGI022, 
BY1023/BF010,  BY1023/ESP009,  BY1023/MEX020,  BY1023/FK3037  and  BY1023/VMG309).  It 
was  stated  that  these  6  studies  support  the  proposed  new  indication  and  treatment  duration  by 
providing at least one symptom recording point of reflux-related symptoms during the first 14 days of 
treatment  with  pantoprazole  and  therefore  are  considered  significant  for  the  application.  Study 
the  applicant  further 
BY1023/BGI022  was  particularly  emphasised.  During 
substantiated  the  justification.  The  applicant  emphasised  that  these  studies  demonstrated  efficacy  in 
the non-prescription setting regarding the proposed indication and related posology which differs from 
that of the prescription product. The applicant, in addition to study BGI022 (CSR 257/2004), referred 
to study MEX020 (CSR 200/2004). The applicant also referred to studies BF010 (CSR 298E/99) and 
VMG309  (CSR  323/2004)  which  were  considered  to  provide  data for early  onset  of relief  of  reflux 
symptoms. Overall the applicant considered that the new data from the aforementioned studies added 
significant support  to  the  classification as non-prescription  product as they  provided  both  effect  and 
relevance to the assessment. 
the  procedure, 
The CHMP reviewed the clinical data submitted, taking into account the provisions of Article 74a of 
Directive  2001/83/EC,  as  amended,  in  support  of  the  classification  of  PANTOZOL  Control  20  mg 
gastro-resistant tablets as ‘medicinal product not subject to medical prescription’.

With reference to the above 6 studies, the CHMP made the following observations (see also comments 
included in the above table): 
-  BGI022 (CSR 257/2004) 
In  this  pivotal  study  the  differences  between  pantoprazole  20  mg  and  ranitidine  150  mg  results 
were significant; however the unpublished study conclusion for BGI022 were very similar to those 
of  the  published  ranitidine  150  mg  comparative  study  VMG306  and  overall  does  not  add 
significant value to the application.  
-  BF010 (CSR 298E/99) 
This study compared the efficacy of omeprazole 10 mg  versus pantoprazole 20 mg at day 28 in 
patients without oesophagitis established by endoscopy. No day 14 data was available in the study 
report.  In  the  non-prescription  product  setting,  the  patient  would  be  self-referring  to  their 
physician if no symptomatic relief was obtained by day 14, making this study of limited value in 
the non-prescription context. Additionally, the usual starting dose for omeprazole in reflux disease 
is 20 mg; 10 mg omeprazole is not therapeutically equivalent to 20 mg pantoprazole. The study 
contained  a  treatment  phase  C;  days  29-56,  but  again,  this  is  not  relevant  to  a  non-prescription 
indication of no more than 28 days. Overall this study provides no relevant data analogous to the 
initial non-prescription medication period of up to 14 days. Additionally, in other studies efficacy 
of pantoprazole was compared to other PPIs (lansoprazole, esomeprazole) and it was found to be 
non-inferior  to  these  PPIs  in  relieving  symptoms  of  heartburn  and  acid  regurgitation  (Study 
VMG305 and M3-320). 
-  VMG309 (CSR 323/2004) 
This study compared the efficacy of omeprazole 10 mg versus pantoprazole 20 mg after one and 
two  weeks  or  treatment.  Symptomatic  relief  was  comparable  between  the  products  though  no 
statistically significant differences could be found between the groups at the end of week 1. No 
week 2 relief rate analysis was provided. The findings of this study are in line with other published 
studies  (Study  VMG305  and  M3-320),  which  showed  that  the  efficacy  of  pantoprazole  is  non-
inferior to other PPIs (such as lansoprazole and esomeprazole). 
-  ESP009 (CSR 396/2004) 
This  study  compared  the  efficacy  of  20  mg  pantoprazole  once  daily  with  150  mg  twice  daily 
ranitidine  in  healing  of  oesophagitis  and  freedom  from  GORD  symptoms  after  treatment. 
Pantoprazole was superior to ranitidine in the treatment of key GORD symptoms. Similar results 
were shown by study FK3059, VMG306, FK3034, BGSA006, which also showed superiority of 
20 mg pantoprazole compared to 300 mg ranitidine in the treatment of reflux symptoms. 
-  MEX020 (CSR 200/2004) 
In this study the efficacy of 20 mg pantoprazole was compared to 10 mg omeprazole at day 28 in 
patients with reflux oesophagitis. The study concluded that pantoprazole 20 mg has a trend to have 
a faster relief of symptoms during the first 7 days of treatment compared with omeprazole 10 mg, 
but no statistically significant differences were found after 7 days, 4 weeks or 8 weeks treatment 
between the groups. 14 day data was not provided by this study. The shortcomings of this study 
are the same as described above for study BF010: lack of day 14 makes this study of limited value 
in the non-prescription context where the patient would be self-referring to their physician if no

symptomatic  relief  was  obtained  by  day  14.  The  usual  starting  dose  for  omeprazole  in  reflux 
disease  is  20  mg;  10  mg  omeprazole  is  not  therapeutically  equivalent  to  20  mg  pantoprazole. 
Additionally, in other studies efficacy of pantoprazole was compared to other PPIs (lansoprazole, 
esomeprazole)  and  it  was  found  to  be  non-inferior  to  these  PPIs  in  relieving  symptoms  of 
heartburn and acid regurgitation (Study VMG305 and M3-320). 
-  FK3037 (CSR 105/96) 
This  study  compared  the  efficacy  and  tolerability  of  pantoprazole  20  mg,  40  mg,  or  80  mg  in 
healing  of  oesophagitis  and  freedom  from  GORD  symptoms.  The  results  showed  that  all  of  the 
above doses are effective and comparable in the treatment of GORD. Similar results were shown 
in the published study M3-316 which compared the efficacy of 20 and 40 mg pantoprazole in the 
treatment of GORD symptoms.

to support clinical efficacy and safety, the application is based on the results of 17 clinical studies. 
None  of  the  6  above-mentioned  studies  provide  data  to  support  the  proposed  indication  and 
treatment duration that could not be derived from the other 11 studies provided in the application. 
Therefore, the 6 above-mentioned studies do not provide clinical data which has genuine impact 
on the assessment of the application.

2.8  Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation 
Quality 
Information  on  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  drug  substance  and  drug  product  has 
been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance. 
Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology 
No additional nonclinical studies were required for this application. Based on the available data it is 
concluded that pantoprazole has a nonclinical safety profile comparable to that of other proton pump 
inhibitors. The relevant information is adequately reflected in section 5.3 of the SPC. 
Efficacy 
The  results  of  clinical  studies  where  symptomatic  relief  of  GORD  was  investigated  show  that 
pantoprazole provides relief of heartburn and acid regurgitation during a short-term treatment course 
(2-4 weeks). The data from the main studies can be summarised as follows: 
- 
In study BGSA017 the differences between pantoprazole and placebo in the relief from heartburn 
were  statistically  significant  at  1  and  2  weeks  in  both  the  intent-to-treat  and  per  protocol 
populations  (p<0.001).  Time  until  freedom  from  acid  eructation  was  significantly  different 
between the treatment groups (p < 0.0001). The time until freedom from heartburn and “all key 
GORD  symptoms"  was  also  significantly  different  between  the  treatment  groups  (p  <  0.001). 
Other  GI  symptoms  (epigastric  pain,  retrosternal  tightness,  nausea,  vomiting  etc.)  showed  a 
considerable  decrease.  The  difference  between  the  treatment  groups  was  statistically  significant 
(p<0.001).

- 
In  study  BGI022  the  differences between  the  pantoprazole  and ranitidine  groups  in  the  relief of 
heartburn  were  statistically  significant  in  both  the  intent-to-treat  and  per-protocol  populations  at 
Day 14 (p < 0.05). At Day 28 heartburn relief observed with pantoprazole was higher than with 
ranitidine, but the differences were not significant (p=0.079 ITT, and p=0.088 PP, respectively). 
Results for the relief of acid regurgitation showed similar results. All other GORD symptoms (acid 
regurgitation, pain on swallowing, epigastric pain etc.) improved in most of the patients.  
To further substantiate the appropriateness of the selection of main studies the results were compared 
with other studies where GORD symptoms were the primary efficacy endpoint and data on symptom 
relief were available for at least the first seven days of treatment. In these studies between 57 and 78% 
of  patients  reported  relief  from  heartburn  at  day  7  and  73-83%  at  day  14.  In  terms  of  the  acid 
regurgitation between 53 and 78% of subjects had freedom from symptoms at day 7 and between 73 
and 80% at day 14. The corresponding results from the pivotal study BGSA017 are 67% at day 7 and 
74% at day 14 for heartburn (no data from the ITT population is available for acid regurgitation) and 
from study BGI022 70% at day 14 for heartburn and 73% at day 14 for acid eructation (no data for day 
7 available). The data from the additional studies are in line with the main studies, which is reassuring. 
The  CHMP  noted  that  in  the  majority  of  the  studies  patients  were  included  based  on  endoscopic 
examination rather than symptoms alone. Since the use as non-prescription medicine requires selection 
of  the  medicine  based  on  symptoms  the  applicant  was  requested  to  explain  how  the  results  of  the 
studies  can  be  extrapolated  to  the  proposed  non-prescription  indication  and  patient  population.  The 
applicant provided the results of a published study, which involved 3000 subjects as a random sample 
of the adult population of two Swedish municipalities2. 1000 of these subjects underwent endoscopic 
examination  and  76.9%  of  them  had  macroscopically  normal  oesophagus.  Of  the  400  subjects  with 
symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, only 24.5% had erosive oesophagitis. In the 17 studies 
provided by the applicant 66.5% of the patients had normal oesophagus or mild oesophagitis, which is 
largely in line with the population of the published study. The results of the Swedish study therefore 
support that the study population of its main studies is applicable to the non-prescription setting where 
the majority of patients will have normal oesophagus or mild oesophagitis. In addition, the results of 
study FK3059 were considered highly relevant to the non-prescription setting as patients were enrolled 
without endoscopic examination. In this study pantoprazole was significantly better than ranitidine in 
providing symptomatic relief of GORD. Finally an analysis of heartburn response rates stratified by 
initial  GORD  stage  was  performed  for  the  studies  where  the  primary  endpoint  was  freedom  from 
heartburn.  The  objective  was  to  explore  if  different  GORD  stage  has  an  effect  on  the  efficacy  of 
pantoprazole.  The  differences  between  patients  with  GORD  stage  0  vs.  GORD  stage  I  in  the  relief 
from  heartburn  rates  in  the  pantoprazole  group  were  not  statistically  different  at  day  7,  14  and  28. 
Taking together the available evidence it is considered that the results of the submitted studies can be 
generalised to the proposed non-prescription population.  
It  was  noted  by  the  CHMP  that  the  maximum  effect  of  proton  pump  inhibitors  is  experienced 
following  a  few  days  treatment,  while  antacids  and  histamine  receptor  antagonists  exert  their  effect 
without  delay.  However,  indirect  data  on  the  consumption  of  antacids  during  treatment  with 
pantoprazole which was allowed in two studies show that, in spite of the slower effect of pantoprazole, 
this consumption was low. Information about the onset of pantoprazole’s action and clarification that 
this medicine does not act immediately is included in the SPC and the Package Leaflet. 
Safety 
The patient exposure with pantoprazole is large and the product has a well established safety profile. 
In  clinical  studies  the  incidence  of  adverse  events  with  pantoprazole  was  comparable  to  placebo 
(21.5%  vs.  24%,  respectively).  The  most  frequently  reported  adverse  events  were  nausea,  diarrhoea 
and  headache.  The  serious  adverse  event  rates  were  2.1%  vs.  1.4%  for  pantoprazole  and  placebo,

respectively.  These  included  diarrhoea,  abdominal  pain,  headache,  nausea,  chest  pain  and  rash. 
Clinical  studies  in  elderly  patients  and  in  patients  with  liver  or  kidney  disease  did  not  identify  any 
concerns.  
The  most  frequently  reported  adverse  events  during  the  post-marketing  period  included  diarrhoea, 
headache and nausea. This is in line with adverse events reported from clinical studies. With regard to 
serious adverse events the most common were thrombocytopenia, angioedema, urticaria and hepatitis.  
Seven  deaths  were  reported  to  the  applicant  during  the  post-marketing  period  where  there  was  a 
possible relation between pantoprazole and death. One of the cases included a patient with Stevens-
Johnson syndrome and six cases included patients with toxic epidermal necrolysis. These cases were 
strongly confounded with all patients taking concomitant medications.  
Conditions  with  special  interest  (rhabdomyolysis,  pancytopenia,  respiratory  tract  infections,  hip 
fracture,  cardiovascular  events,  pancreatitis,  and  serious  skin  reactions)  identified  during  the  post-
marketing period do not raise concerns.  
Overall,  the  low  incidence  rate  of  adverse  events  during  the  post-marketing  period  is  reassuring. 
Pantoprazole  is  indicated  for  a  range  of  acid-related  gastrointestinal  disorders.  It  is  noted  that  the 
adverse drug reactions reported during the post-marketing period originated from a patient population 
received pantoprazole for different indications, not only for the proposed non-prescription indication 
of mild reflux-like symptoms. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
•  User consultation 
A user consultation has been performed with the proposed package leaflet. Based on the results it is 
considered that the leaflet is appropriate for its intended target audience. 
Risk-benefit assessment 
Benefits 
As reflux symptoms are common and can affect the quality of life of the majority of sufferers a proton 
pump inhibitor is usually used as a first-line treatment. Pantoprazole 20mg provides an effective short-
term treatment in mild reflux symptoms. Results of 17 randomized controlled clinical studies (i.e. two 
pivotal and 15 supportive studies), in which pantoprazole 20mg was investigated with regard to relief 
of reflux symptoms as a primary or secondary endpoint, have been presented. In the first pivotal study 
BGSA017 a daily dosage of 20mg pantoprazole was shown to be significantly superior to placebo in 
the complete relief from heartburn and acid regurgitation during a 2-week treatment course in GORD 
patients  without  endoscopic  lesions.  In  the  second  pivotal  study  BGI022  pantoprazole  20mg  was 
shown to be significantly superior to ranitidine 150mg twice daily in the complete relief of heartburn 
after 2 weeks of treatment in patients with endoscopically normal oesophagus or mild oesophagitis.  
In a retrospective analysis using a standardized methodology, which included the 17 clinical studies 
selected for this application, pantoprazole 20mg was shown to be significantly superior to placebo and 
H2-receptor antagonists, and statistically non-inferior to other proton-pump inhibitors in the complete 
relief from heartburn after 1 and 2 weeks. Already after 1 week of treatment, rates of complete relief 
from  heartburn  between  54%  and  81%  were  achieved  with  pantoprazole  20  mg.  A  further 
improvement in the heartburn relief rates was observed after 14 and 28 days of treatment. Analysis of 
the symptom acid regurgitation showed similar symptom relief rates after 1 week between 62% and 
84%  with  pantoprazole  20  mg.  Again  a  further  improvement  was  observed  after  14  and  28  days, 
respectively. Significant superiority of pantoprazole 20 mg in the complete relief of acid regurgitation 
over  both  placebo  and  ranitidine  150  mg  twice  daily  was  observed  at  day  14  in  the  pivotal  studies 
BGSA017 and BGI022, respectively, and in six out of seven supportive studies.

The  application  concerns  the  supply  as  non-prescription  medicine.  Typically  a  patient  with  GORD 
symptoms  sees  a  pharmacist  in  the  first  instance.  Initiation  of  treatment  of  GORD  is  based  on 
symptoms,  and  non-prescription  products  are  used  for  this  purpose.  Data  from  actual  use  studies 
support the use of proton pump inhibitors in this setting. Given that there are no direct safety issues 
that preclude pantoprazole being available as a non-prescription medicine this supply classification is 
considered of benefit to the patients. 
Risks 
There is a long-standing safety experience with pantoprazole and its safety profile is well characterised 
and  similar  to  those  reported  for  other  proton  pump  inhibitors.  During  extensive  post-marketing 
experience, no safety concerns have been identified. The majority of adverse drug reactions were mild 
and transient in nature. They mostly referred to gastrointestinal and nervous system disorders such as 
diarrhoea, nausea, and headache.  
Indirect  danger  to  human  health,  even  when  the  product  is  used  correctly,  may  arise  if  the 
symptomatic  treatment  masks  an  underlying  condition  requiring  medical  attention.  The  patient 
information  leaflet  includes  adequate  advice  that  patients  should  consult  a  doctor  if  alarming 
symptoms are present or if symptoms are not improving within 2 weeks of treatment. Together with 
the  labelling  the  written  information  available  to  the  patient  is  considered  adequate  to  contribute 
effectively to the safe and effective use of the medicine including appropriate guarding that the non-
prescription medicine is not used where it is contraindicated or unsafe.  
The  proposed  small  pack  sizes  (7  and  14  tablet  packs)  is  an  additional  measure  to  minimise  any 
potential risk associated with incorrect use or unintentional misuse. 
Balance 
Reflux symptoms associated with GORD are in principle a suitable condition for treatment with non-
prescription medicines. The efficacy of pantoprazole in the proposed indication and posology has been 
demonstrated. The safety profile of pantoprazole is established and allows the assessment according to 
the applicable criteria for non-prescription medicines. 
Based  on  the  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy  the  benefits  of  PANTOZOL  Control 
outweigh  the  risks  for  the  short-term  treatment  of  reflux  symptoms  under  the  classification  as 
medicinal product not subject to medical prescription.  
Recommendation 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by 
consensus that the risk-benefit balance of PANTOZOL Control indicated for “short-term treatment of 
reflux symptoms (e.g. heartburn, acid regurgitation) in adults”, as a medicinal product not subject to 
medical  prescription  was  favourable  and  therefore  recommended  the  granting  of  the  marketing 
authorisation. 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the nonclinical and clinical data submitted by the applicant taking 
into account the provisions of Article 74a of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, and did not consider 
that  the  data  submitted  in  support  of  the  change  of  classification  of  the  medicinal  product  were 
significant.

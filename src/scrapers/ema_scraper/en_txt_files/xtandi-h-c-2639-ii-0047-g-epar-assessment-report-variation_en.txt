2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
This application is to extend the indication of Xtandi (enzalutamide) to include the treatment of adult men 
with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) in combination with androgen deprivation 
therapy. Hormone-sensitive prostate cancer is defined as the absence of evidence of castration 
resistance, defined as prostate cancer that progresses despite castrate levels of testosterone while on 
Assessment report  
EMA/202601/2021 
Page 7/100 
 
 
  
  
 
 
treatment with a luteinizing-hormone releasing hormone analogue (LHRHa), or following bilateral 
orchiectomy (J Clin Oncol. 2008;26:1148–59). 
Epidemiology  
Worldwide, prostate cancer ranks second in cancer incidence and fifth in cancer mortality in men (Bray et 
al, 2018). In Europe, the estimated number of new prostate cancer cases was approximately 473,344 in 
2020 and the number of deaths was approximately 108,088 in 2020 (GLOBOCAN, 2020).  
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Prostate cancer may present as localised disease, locally advanced disease or metastatic disease at initial 
diagnosis. Despite intense use of Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) for screening and early detection of 
prostate cancer, 2% to 43% of patients initially present with metastatic disease (Cancer Research UK, 
2019; Siegel et al, 2019; Schröder et al, 2012; Tombal, 2012). 
Staging of Prostate cancer is done using the Clinical Tumour Node Metastasis (TNM) classification, the 
Gleason Score and/or current  International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grading system (N 
Mottet, 2018 Guidelines for staging of prostate cancer). 
The prognosis of men with prostate cancer drops considerably upon the development of metastases (5-
year OS rate of 30%) (Noone et al, 2018; James et al, 2016). Moreover, death of patients with 
metastatic CRPC typically occurs within 24 to 48 months after the onset of metastatic castration 
resistance and is commonly preceded by a sequence of landmark events associated with deterioration of 
overall health and worsening symptoms including pain and cachexia (Beer et al, 2017; Devlin et al, 2017; 
Basch et al, 2013; Logothetis et al, 2012). Prognostic factors that influence survival in metastatic 
castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) include high prostate specific antigen (PSA) concentration 
at diagnosis, high Gleason score, higher primary tumour stage, worse World Health Organization (WHO) 
performance status, younger age, and the presence of bone metastases. 
Management  
Localised disease may be amenable to curative primary intervention such as surgery or radiation therapy, 
however, a significant proportion of patients have a recurrence of disease and require systemic 
treatment. Early in the disease, prostate cancer is dependent on androgen for growth and survival. 
Therefore, depriving prostate cancer cells of androgen is a primary form of therapy. Such prostate 
cancers are referred to as androgen-dependent or hormone-sensitive and treatments that decrease 
androgen levels or block androgen activity can inhibit their growth.  
Patients with recurrent disease after primary treatment, or those who present with more advanced or 
metastatic disease, are usually treated with Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT). Initially, most patients 
are sensitive to androgen deprivation (castration), but eventually there is a progression from hormone-
sensitive prostate cancer to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), where CRPC is defined as 
disease progression in the setting of castrate levels of testosterone (<50 ng/dL). 
As metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer is dependent on androgen for growth and survival, 
depriving prostate cancer cells of androgen is a primary form of therapy for mHSPC patients. ADT has 
been the basis for the treatment of patients with mHSPC, and results in a median overall survival of 3-4 
years. ADT is defined as surgical castration by bilateral orchiectomy or medical castration with 
Assessment report  
EMA/202601/2021 
Page 8/100 
 
 
  
  
 
gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists or antagonists (EAU, ESMO, NCCN 2018, Fizazi 2017). 
The aim of these approaches is to reduce testosterone concentrations. Although the majority of mHSPC 
patients have an initial response to treatment with ADT, most men progress to castration-resistant 
prostate cancer within a median of approximately 1 year. 
Treatment options for men with mHSPC have expanded beyond ADT alone. Two studies (STAMPEDE ARM 
C and CHAARTED) provide evidence that combining a short course of docetaxel chemotherapy with ADT 
in mCSPC resulted in prolonged survival compared with treatment with ADT alone. Docetaxel is currently 
approved in combination with ADT, with or without prednisone or prednisolone, for the treatment of 
patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (see EPAR docetaxel). Additionally, the 
STAMPEDE ARM G and LATITUDE studies showed that abiraterone acetate plus low-dose prednisone 
(AAP) added to ADT was effective in prolonging overall survival (OS) compared with ADT alone. 
Abiraterone acetate is indicated with prednisone or prednisolone for the treatment of newly diagnosed 
high risk metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) in adult men in combination with 
androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (see EPAR Zytiga). Both ADT plus docetaxel and ADT plus 
abiraterone/prednisone are recommended by ESMO guideline as first-line treatment of metastatic, 
hormone-naïve disease (ESMO 2015; ESMO eUpdate 2019). 
Furthermore, apalutamide has also recently been approved in adult men for the treatment of metastatic 
hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) 
(see EPAR Erleada).  
2.1.2.  About the product 
Enzalutamide is a potent androgen receptor signalling inhibitor that blocks several steps in the androgen 
receptor signalling pathway. Enzalutamide competitively inhibits androgen binding to androgen receptors, 
and consequently; inhibits nuclear translocation of activated receptors and inhibits the association of the 
activated androgen receptor with DNA even in the setting of androgen receptor overexpression and in 
prostate cancer cells resistant to anti androgens. Enzalutamide treatment decreases the growth of 
prostate cancer cells and can induce cancer cell death and tumour regression. In preclinical studies 
enzalutamide lacks androgen receptor agonist activity (see SmPC section 5.1). 
Enzalutamide was approved in the EU in June 2013. Enzalutamide is currently approved for the treatment 
of adult men with metastatic CRPC who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic after failure of androgen 
deprivation therapy in whom chemotherapy is not yet clinically indicated and for those whose disease has 
progressed on or after docetaxel therapy. Enzalutamide is also authorised for the treatment of adult men 
with high-risk non-metastatic CRPC (see SmPC 4.1). 
The MAH applied for an extension of indication for Xtandi as follows: “Xtandi is indicated for the treatment 
of adult men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) in combination with androgen 
deprivation therapy (see section 5.1).” 
The recommended dose is 160 mg enzalutamide (four 40 mg soft capsules) as a single oral daily dose.  
Medical castration with a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue should be continued 
during treatment of patients not surgically castrated. 
Additionally, the MAH provided the updated 5-year overall survival results obtained from the PREVAIL 
study (MDV3100-03) in chemo-naïve mCRPC for inclusion in the SmPC.

2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
Scientific Advice was sought from CHMP on the adequacy of the design and statistical analysis of a 
phase 3 study to support the proposed indication. The proposed study (Study 9785-CL-0335) was a 
multinational, phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of enzalutamide plus ADT versus placebo plus ADT in patients with mHSPC.  
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
A request for GCP inspection was adopted for the following study: Study 9785-CL-0335 (ARCHES). The 
outcome of this inspection was satisfactory and no critical findings that could have compromised the 
integrity of the trial were found.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Pharmacology 
No additional nonclinical pharmacology studies were submitted to support the current application (see 
non-clinical discussion). 
2.2.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No additional nonclinical pharmacokinetics studies were submitted to support the current application (see 
non-clinical discussion). 
2.2.3.  Toxicology 
Carcinogenicity 
The MAH had previously submitted the report for the 26-week definitive carcinogenicity study in the Tg 
rasH2  mouse  (EMEA/H/C/002639/II/0039/G).  The  current  submission  completes  the  carcinogenicity 
evaluation of enzalutamide by providing data in both sexes from a preliminary 13-week dose-range finding 
(DRF) study in Wistar Hannover (WH)rats and a definitive 104-week carcinogenicity study in WH rats. 
13-week DRF Study [9785-TX-0016]: 
Wistar Hannover rats (12/gender/group, 6 weeks of age at the start of treatment) were treated with 
enzalutamide for 13 weeks (once a day), at dose levels of 0 (Water for injection), 0 (vehicle, Labrasol), 
50, 100 and 200 mg/kg/day. Clinical observation, body weight, food consumption, ophthalmology, 
urinalysis, haematology, clinical chemistry, organ weight, necropsy and histopathological examination 
were conducted. In addition, systemic exposure was evaluated by determining plasma concentrations of 
enzalutamide and its metabolites on Day 1 (first administration), in Week 4 and in Week 13 of 
administration in the satellite animals.  
Enzalutamide was well tolerated in rats for 13 weeks at dose levels up to 200 mg/kg/day. Enzalutamide-
related findings in males included increases in absolute and relative weights of the testes, and decreases

in absolute and relative weights of the prostate, epididymides and seminal vesicles; associated decreases 
in the sizes of the prostate and seminal vesicles, as well as microscopic findings of diffuse Leydig cell 
hyperplasia in the testes and minimal atrophy of the prostate and seminal vesicles (≥ 50 mg/kg/day). 
Necropsy revealed calculi in the urinary bladder in males. In the kidney, enzalutamide-related findings 
included increases in kidney weight (≥ 100 mg/kg/day, males; ≥50 mg/kg/day, females) and microscopic 
findings of pelvic crystals (200 mg/kg/day, male), dilatation of the distal tubules and collecting ducts (≥ 
50 mg/kg/day, males), regeneration of collecting duct in papilla (≥ 100 mg/kg/day, both sexes), and 
urothelial hyperplasia (≥ 100 mg/kg/day, both sexes). 
These findings were associated with increases in plasma creatinine (≥ 50 mg/kg/day, males) and blood 
urea nitrogen (≥ 100 mg/kg/day, males). In the urinary bladder, there were crystals (≥ 100 mg/kg/day, 
males) and urothelial hyperplasia (≥ 50 mg/kg/day, males). Urinalysis indicated unidentified needle-like 
crystals in the urinary sediments (≥ 50 mg/kg/day, both sexes). 
Based on the saturation of absorption, lack of exposure increase and generally similar findings between 
100 and 200 mg/kg/day in the 13-week dose range finding study, 100 mg/kg/day was selected as the 
highest dose for the 2-year carcinogenicity study. The low (10 mg/kg/day) and mid (30 mg/kg/day) 
doses were selected to cover a wide range of clinical exposure margins and study dose responses. 
104-week (104-week) Carcinogenicity Study [9785-TX-0017]: 
A  2-year  carcinogenicity  study  in  rats  was  conducted  with  Wistar Han  (both sexes).  In  this  study  dose 
levels: 0, 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg were given per day. Survival rates in the Control II (Labrasol vehicle) 
group were 51.4% in males and 55.7% in females. Survival rates in the 100 mg/kg/day (high dose) dose 
group were slightly lower in males (38.6%) compared to concurrent male controls and to the female high 
dose group (40.0%). The mortality in males at 100 mg/kg/day was largely attributed to urinary bladder 
tumours, which were occasionally accompanied by reddish urine and additional non-neoplastic renal and 
urogenital tract findings, without palpable masses. 
Daily dosing of rats for two years with enzalutamide at 10–100 mg/kg/day produced an increased incidence 
of neoplastic findings (compared to control).  
Enzalutamide-related neoplastic findings can be divided into 1) tumours that were potentially related to 
the primary pharmacology and 2) tumours in males that were likely secondary to the continuous irritation 
caused by the urinary crystals and calculi in the rat kidney and urinary bladder. The tumours related to 
the primary pharmacology included benign thymoma of the thymus, fibroadenoma of the mammary 
glands, and benign Leydig cell tumours of the testes in males; benign granulosa cell tumours of the 
ovaries in females; and adenoma of the pituitary pars distalis in both sexes. The tumours that were 
considered secondary to irritation caused by crystals/calculi included urothelial papilloma/carcinoma of 
the urinary bladder in males. The dose-specific animal to human exposure margins for each sex in the 
carcinogenicity study are summarized in

Enzalutamide is not a PBT substance. 
Considering the above data, enzalutamide is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.2.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No additional nonclinical pharmacology and pharmacokinetic studies were submitted. This is acceptable 
since the nonclinical data available from previous submissions are considered sufficient to support the 
newly claimed indication. 
With regards to carcinogenicity, the daily oral administration of enzalutamide for 26 weeks did not 
demonstrate any neoplastic findings, indicative of a lack of carcinogenic potential in the Tg rasH2 mice at 
a dose of ≤ 20 mg/kg per day. However, taking into account that the plasma exposure levels at 
20 mg/kg/day (348 µg.h/mL and 286 µg.h/mL, in females and males respectively) were similar to the 
clinical exposure in metastatic CRPC patients receiving 160 mg/kg/day (322 µg.h/mL) and, the AUC24h 
for M1 and M2 ranged from 0.08 to 0.21-fold of those in humans, the carcinogenicity potential of 
enzalutamide cannot be discarded.  
In the 13-week DRF study in Wistar Han (WH) rats, enzalutamide was found to be well-tolerated. Based 
on the saturation of absorption, as evidenced by a lack of a dose-dependent exposure increase and 
generally similar findings at 100 and 200 mg/kg/day, the 100 mg/kg/day was selected as the high dose 
for the 104-week carcinogenicity study, with the low (10 mg/kg/day) and mid (30 mg/kg/day) dose levels 
selected to cover a wide range of clinical exposure margins and study dose responses.  
A 2 year carcinogenicity study in rats Wistar Han (both sexes) has been completed in line with ICH S1A 
guideline. In this study (dose levels: 0, 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg per day), the increased incidences of the 
following tumours were considered treatment-related in male Wistar Han (WH) rats: Leydig cell tumour in 
the testis (≥10 mg/kg per day); benign thymoma in the thymus (≥10 mg/kg per day); and urothelial 
papilloma/carcinoma in the urinary bladder, adenoma of pars distalis in the pituitary and fibroadenoma in 
the mammary gland (100 mg/kg per day). 
In female WH rats, treatment-related increases in adenoma of pars distalis in the pituitary (≥ 30 mg/kg 
per day) and benign granulosa cell tumour in the ovary (100 mg/kg per day) were noted.

Except for the urinary bladder, these tumours were observed in organs that are regulated via the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal hormone axis and may be related to the pharmacological activity of 
enzalutamide. Leydig cell tumours in rats are generally accepted as not relevant to humans [Cook et al, 
1999].  The human relevance of thymoma, pituitary adenoma, granulosa cell tumour in the ovary and 
mammary fibroadenoma in rats cannot be ruled out. 
Urothelial papilloma/carcinoma in the urinary bladder could be induced by continuous local irritation of 
the epithelium by crystals or calculi that consist of excreted carboxylic acid metabolite. Calculi and 
crystals were observed in rat urinary bladders. However, no obvious mechanistic rationale to explain 
specifically this malignancy can be established. At 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg per day, the exposure multiples 
of enzalutamide in male rats were 0.28-, 0.76- and 1.4-fold, respectively, of the exposure in humans 
taking enzalutamide 160 mg/day, while those of the inactive carboxylic acid metabolite were 0.17-, 0.44- 
and 1.7-fold, respectively. At all dose levels, the exposure multiple of the active metabolite, N-desmethyl 
enzalutamide, in male rats was less than 0.12-fold. In conclusion, taking into account that exposure 
levels, based on AUC, achieved in the study, for enzalutamide plus its metabolite M2, were less than or 
similar to those in prostate cancer patients at the recommended dose of 160 mg/day (322 µg.h/mL), 
urinary bladder carcinogenicity potential of enzalutamide in human cannot be excluded . Results of 
PROSPER clinical trial, assessed as part of the procedure EMEA/H/C/002639/II/0049, support that the 
clinical relevance of these types of tumours observed in rats cannot be ruled out. The results of the 
carcinogenicity study have been reflected in section 5.3 of the SmPC as part of variation 
EMEA/H/C/002639/II/0049. 
The MAH has submitted an updated ERA to consider the potential impact of the increased patient 
population from the new indication on the environmental risk assessment of enzalutamide. Furthermore, 
in the original ERA, the degradation half-lives in aquatic sediment systems were reported at 20°C. The 
current guidance is to report half-lives at 12°C which more accurately reflects the temperature of 
European surface waters. This amendment quotes the degradation half-lives at 12°C and considers the 
environmental impact of these extrapolated half-lives. Based on the assessment of the updated ERA, 
enzalutamide is unlikely to represent a risk to the aquatic or terrestrial environments. 
2.2.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the non-clinical package is considered adequate to support this application to extend the 
indication to patients with metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer. 
Considering the above data, enzalutamide is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.2.  Clinical Pharmacology 
No new pharmacology data were submitted in support of this application. 
2.3.3.  Discussion and conclusion on clinical pharmacology 
No additional data have been provided with this submission which is considered acceptable as the clinical 
pharmacology properties of enzalutamide were described in detail in the original marketing application 
and previous supplemental applications with new clinical data consistent with results in the original 
marketing application. All studies included in support of this application used enzalutamide at the 
approved dose of 160 mg/day, which has been established as a generally safe and efficacious dose in 
patients with CRPC and mHSPC. Available clinical pharmacology data are considered sufficient to support 
this application. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
No new dose responses studies were submitted with this application. The posology for the proposed 
indication (enzalutamide 160 mg administered orally once daily) is the daily dose authorised for other 
indications.

ARCHES (Study 9785-CL-0335): a multinational, Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of enzalutamide plus ADT vs placebo plus 
ADT in patients with mHSPC 
While on study treatment, patients returned to the study site at weeks 5 and 13 and every 12 weeks thereafter. At 
week 5, general activities included brief physical examination, vital signs, clinical laboratory and PSA testing, 
assessment of ECOG performance status, adverse events, concomitant medications reviews and study drug dispensing. 
At week 13 and every 12 weeks thereafter until treatment discontinuation, general activities included radiographic 
assessments (including a chest x-ray or CT/MRI), testosterone testing and completion of patient-reported outcome 
questionnaires in addition to the activities performed at week 5.

Hypersensitivity reaction to the active pharmaceutical ingredient or any of the study capsule 
components 
Treatments 
Study drug consisted of enzalutamide provided as 40-mg capsules or tablets to be taken as 160 mg (4 
capsules or tablets) orally once daily or enzalutamide-matching placebo. Treatment was to be continued 
until the radiographic disease progression was documented, the patient started another investigational 
agent or new therapy for treatment of prostate cancer, unacceptable toxicity or any other discontinuation 
criteria were met. All subjects were required to maintain ADT during study treatment, either using an 
LHRH agonist/antagonist or having a history of bilateral orchiectomy. 
During the study, subjects who experience a National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) guidelines (version 4.03) grade 3 or higher AE (except liver function 
test [LFT] AE) toxicity that is attributed to the study drug and cannot be ameliorated by the use of 
adequate medical intervention and/or dose reduction may interrupt study drug treatment for 1 week or 
until the toxicity grade improves to grade 2 or lower in severity. Study drug may be restarted at the 
original dose (160 mg/day) or a reduced dose (120 mg or 80 mg/day) in consultation with the Medical 
Monitor. After dose reduction, based on subject tolerance, study drug may be increased to a maximum 
dose of 160 mg/day per Investigator discretion. 
Enzalutamide must be interrupted during the evaluation of symptoms suspicious of posterior reversible 
encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) (headache, lethargy, confusion, blindness and other visual and 
neurological disturbances, with or without associated hypertension). 
Restarting treatment at a reduced dose or after treatment interruption for > 2 weeks must be discussed 
with the Medical Monitor. 
Objectives 
Primary objective 
The primary objective was to determine the benefit of enzalutamide plus ADT as compared to placebo 
plus ADT as assessed by radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) based on Independent Central 
Review (ICR). 
Secondary objectives 
Key secondary objectives of the study were to evaluate the benefit of enzalutamide plus ADT compared 
with placebo plus ADT as measured by Overall Survival (OS), time to PSA progression, time to start of 
new antineoplastic therapy, PSA undetectable (< 0.2 ng/mL) rate, Overall Response Rate (ORR) and time 
to deterioration of urinary symptoms.  
Additional secondary objectives were to compare time to first symptomatic skeletal event (SSE); time to 
castration resistance; Quality of Life (QoL) as measured by Quality of Life Questionnaire-Prostate 25 
(QLQ-PR25), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – Prostate (FACT-P) and EuroQoL Group 5-
Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L), and in particular the time to deterioration in QoL using the FACT-P global 
score; worsening of pain assessed by Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF); and to evaluate safety of 
enzalutamide plus ADT as compared to placebo plus ADT. 
Exploratory objective (North America sites only) 
The study also included an exploratory objective to determine gene mutations potentially related to 
resistance of enzalutamide plus ADT as assessed by DNA mutation testing (i.e., sequence analysis of 
Assessment report  
EMA/202601/2021

circulating free tumour DNA) in plasma. This objective was limited to patients who signed a separate 
genotyping informed consent form at North American sites. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint was rPFS (based on central review), where rPFS events were defined as objective 
evidence of radiographic progression disease (rPD) as assessed by ICR or death, as follows:  
-  Death from any cause within 24 weeks (2 scan cycles) from study drug discontinuation.  
- 
rPD was defined by RECIST 1.1 for soft tissue disease or the appearance of 2 or more new bone 
lesions on bone scan. Unconfirmed disease progression on a bone scan at week 13 was not to be 
considered an event. The study-specified documentation and confirmation required for the 
determination of rPD are listed in Table 4. The date of rPD was the date the first objective 
evidence of rPD was documented rPFS (based on central review). 
Table 4 Study-specified Documentation for Radiographic Evidence of Disease Progression vs PCWG2 
Criteria 
In patients with an rPFS event, rPFS was to be calculated as the time from the date of randomisation to 
the first objective evidence of rPD at any time or death up to 24 weeks after study drug discontinuation 
without documented radiographic progression, whichever occurred first. In patients with no rPFS event, 
rPFS was to be censored on the date of last evaluable radiographic assessment prior to the data analysis 
cut-off date. In patients with no baseline radiographic assessment, with no postbaseline radiographic 
assessments or with all postbaseline radiographic assessments documented as “not evaluable (NE),” the 
rPFS was to be censored on the date of randomisation. 
Key Secondary endpoints 
•  Overall survival (OS) 
Assessment report  
EMA/202601/2021 
Page 20/100 
 
 
  
  
 
OS was defined as the time from randomisation to death from any cause. All events of death were 
included. For patients who were alive at the time of the data cut-off date, OS time was to be censored 
on the last date the patient was known to be alive or the cut-off date, whichever occurred first. 
• 
Time to PSA progression 
Time to PSA progression was calculated as the time from randomisation to the date of first 
observation of PSA progression. A PSA progression was defined as a ≥ 25% increase and an absolute 
increase of ≥ 2 ng/mL above the nadir (i.e., lowest PSA value observed postbaseline or at baseline), 
which was confirmed by a second consecutive value at least 3 weeks later. Only results from PSA 
samples taken before the start of any new prostate cancer therapy after the start of study drug were 
to be considered. 
• 
Time to start of new antineoplastic therapy 
Time to start of new antineoplastic therapy was defined as the time from randomisation to the date of 
first dose administration of the first antineoplastic therapy. In patients with no new antineoplastic 
therapy initiated for prostate cancer after randomisation, time to start of new antineoplastic therapy 
was to be censored on the last visit date or the date of randomisation, whichever occurred last. 
• 
PSA undetectable rate 
PSA undetectable rate was defined as the percentage of patients with detectable (≥0.2 ng/mL) PSA at 
baseline, which became undetectable (<0.2 ng/mL) during study treatment. Only results from PSA 
samples taken before the start of any new prostate cancer therapy were to be considered. 
•  Overall response rate (ORR) 
This was defined as the percentage of intent-to-treat (ITT) patients with measurable disease at 
baseline who achieved a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) (unconfirmed responses) in 
their soft tissue disease using the RECIST 1.1 criteria. In addition to ORR, the best overall response 
was also determined for each patient based on a combined response assessment. The best combined 
(i.e., overall) response was the best response assessment, based on the RECIST 1.1 assessment for 
soft tissue lesions on CT/MRI and the response assessment for bone lesions on bone scans, reported 
at any time during the study. Bone lesions were assessed for CR, non-CR/non-PD and PD.  As bone 
lesions were evaluated differently than soft tissue lesions, the possible categories changed when 
considering bone and soft tissue responses together.  “CR” reflects patients with CR for all pre-
existing metastases and “PD” reflects patients with PD in either soft tissue or bone. In this setting, 
“PR” includes patients with CR or PR in soft tissue and who remained non-CR/non-PD in bone lesions 
and those patients with PR in soft tissue-only disease. 
• 
Time to deterioration of urinary symptoms 
The deterioration of urinary symptoms was based on responses to a selected subset of symptoms 
from the “urinary symptoms” subscale of the QLQ-PR25 questionnaire (3 items: Q31 to Q33). 
Deterioration in urinary symptoms was defined as an increase in the urinary symptoms’ subscale 
score by ≥ 50% of the standard deviation observed in the urinary symptoms’ subscale score at 
baseline. The time to confirmed deterioration in urinary symptoms was defined as the time interval to 
the first deterioration in urinary symptoms that was confirmed by a second consecutive assessment of 
the deterioration. 
Other secondary endpoints 
• 
Time to castration resistance: defined as the time from randomisation to the first castration 
resistance event. A castration resistance event was defined as the occurrence of rPD by ICR, PSA 
progression, or SSE, whichever occurred first, with castrate levels of testosterone (<50 ng/dL).

Page 21/100 
 
 
  
  
• 
• 
• 
• 
Time to Deterioration of Quality of Life (FACT-P): The time to deterioration of QoL was defined as 
the time interval from the date of randomization to the first date a decline from baseline of 
10 points or more in the FACT-P total score was recorded. 
Time to first symptomatic skeletal event (SSE): an SSE was defined as radiation to bone, surgery 
to bone, a clinically apparent pathological bone fracture or a spinal cord compression. In patients 
with an SSE, the time to the first SSE was defined as the time from randomisation to the 
occurrence of the first SSE prior to the data analysis cut-off date. 
Time to pain progression: defined as time from randomization to the first pain progression event, 
which was an increase of ≥ 30% from baseline in the average Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form 
(BPI-SF) item scores. 
Patient reported outcomes (PRO) using FACT-P, EQ-5D-5L, QLQ-PR25, BPI-SF.  
Sample size 
Approximately 1,100 patients (550 patients per treatment group) were planned to be randomised in the 
study. The final analysis of the primary endpoint (rPFS) was to be conducted when a minimum of 
262 progression events had occurred, based on the following considerations:  
1.  A target hazard ratio (HR) was 0.67. The expected median rPFS for the placebo plus ADT group was 
20 months as measured from the date of randomisation. Under the assumption of an exponential 
distribution, a target HR of 0.67 corresponds to approximately 50% increase in median rPFS for 
the enzalutamide plus ADT group relative to the placebo plus ADT group (approximately 30 vs 20 
months).  
2.  262 rPFS events (radiographic progression at any time or death from any cause within 24 weeks after 
study drug discontinuation, whichever occurred first) provide 90% power to detect the target HR 
based on a 2-sided log-rank test and a significance level of 0.05. 
In addition, the study was powered for OS. Specifically, 342 death events were required to provide 80% 
power to detect a target HR of 0.73 with a target difference in Kaplan-Meier estimated median of 
approximately 15 months (40 months for placebo plus ADT vs 55 months for enzalutamide plus ADT) at 
the 0.04 significance level under the assumption of an exponential distribution. This significance level was 
chosen to apply a parallel testing strategy between OS and some other secondary endpoints (with 
allocated type I error rate of 0.01). 
Randomisation 
Randomisation was performed via the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system and treatment 
assigned in a 1:1 ratio to enzalutamide 160 mg/day or placebo. Subjects were to be stratified by prior 
docetaxel (None, 1-5 cycles, 6 cycles) and disease volume (low versus high). High-volume disease was 
defined as metastases involving the viscera or, in the absence of visceral lesions, the presence of 4 or 
more bone lesions, at least 1 of which in a bony structure beyond the vertebral column and pelvic bone. 
Prior docetaxel therapy was defined as 1 or more cycles of docetaxel but no more than 6 cycles. 
The categories ‘1-5 cycles’ and ‘6 cycles’ used at randomisation for the stratification factor ‘prior 
docetaxel use’ were regrouped in the stratified analyses because of the small number of randomized 
patients with 1 to 5 cycles of docetaxel as prior medication. This stratification factor therefore became 
prior docetaxel use (yes versus no) in the stratified analyses.

Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study.  
Based on substantial Amendment 2 (dated 14 Dec 2017), unblinding of study treatment assignment could 
be performed to determine the next course of therapy if a patient discontinued due to disease 
progression.  
At the time of primary endpoint analysis and recommendation of the Data Safety Monitoring Board 
(DSMB) on study continuation, patients were eligible to transition to an optional open-label extension 
portion of the current study. The open-label extension period was added in Substantial Amendment 3 to 
the study protocol.  
Statistical methods 
The following analysis sets were used for the analyses:  
1.  The ITT population, defined as all patients who were randomised in this study. The ITT population 
was analysed by treatment group as randomised (i.e., treatment group based on randomization 
assignment) regardless of study drug administration. Unless otherwise specified, efficacy analyses 
were performed on the ITT population.  
2.  The safety population, defined as all randomised patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug. 
The safety population was used to conduct safety analyses by treatment group as treated (i.e., 
based on the actual study drug the patient received for the greater number of days rather than 
the study drug to which the patient was randomised). 
Primary efficacy endpoint: rPFS 
The effect of enzalutamide plus ADT compared to placebo plus ADT was tested using a stratified log-rank 
test at the level of significance of 0.05 (2-sided). The stratification factors were prior docetaxel use (yes 
vs no) and disease volume (low vs high); both factors were used at randomisation. The analysis was to 
be conducted when at least 262 rPFS events had occurred.  
Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate the distribution of rPFS events by treatment group. The 
median rPFS was estimated using the corresponding 50th percentile of Kaplan-Meier estimates. A 2-sided 
95% Confidence interval (CI) was provided for this estimate by use of the Brookmeyer and Crowley 
method. The benefit of enzalutamide plus ADT compared to placebo plus ADT was summarised by a 
single HR with its 95% CI based on a Cox regression model stratified for prior docetaxel use and disease 
volume. 
The following sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of the rPFS results:  
•  Sensitivity analysis 1: impact of study drug discontinuation as an additional event.

•  Sensitivity analysis 8: ‘missing’ data impact and censoring rPD on competing risks: new 
antineoplastic therapy, occurrence of an SSE and study drug discontinuation in patients with M1 
based on ICR assessments 
•  Sensitivity analysis 9: limited to M1 patients who were identified from the baseline assessments 
made by ICR 
•  Sensitivity analysis 10: impact of rPD documented by the investigators 
•  Sensitivity analysis 11: impact of rPD according to PCWG2 criteria [Ryan et al, 2012] and

•  Sensitivity analysis 12: impact of rPD according to PCWG2 criteria and documented by ICR 
These sensitivity analyses were conducted on the ITT population using the same analysis methods as 
described for the primary analysis. 
Subgroup analyses of rPFS were performed to determine whether the treatment effect was concordant 
among subgroups. Subgroup analyses were not adjusted for the stratification factors used at 
randomisation. Subgroup assessments included the following: age (<65 years vs ≥65years), geographic 
region, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status at baseline (0 vs 1), Gleason 
score at initial diagnosis (<8 vs ≥8), disease location at baseline (bone only, soft tissue only, both bone 
and soft tissue), baseline PSA (≤ overall median vs > overall median), volume of disease at baseline (low 
vs high), prior docetaxel use (yes vs no) and prior use of ADT or orchiectomy (yes vs no). 
Key secondary efficacy endpoint analyses 
All secondary endpoint analyses were performed at the time of the rPFS final analysis (i.e., when at least 
262 rPFS events had occurred).  
The primary rPFS endpoint was tested at a 0.05 (2-sided) significance level. Once testing confirmed this 
primary endpoint was statistically significant, the 6 key secondary endpoints were tested utilizing a 
method to preserve the family-wise 2-sided type I error rate at 0.05. A parallel testing strategy was used 
to test OS with an allocated type I error rate of 0.04 and the remaining 5 key secondary endpoints (time 
to PSA progression, time to start of a new antineoplastic therapy, rate of PSA decline to <0.2ng/mL, ORR 
and time to deterioration in urinary symptoms from the QLQ-PR25) with an allocated type I error rate of 
0.01.

Figure 2: Testing Strategy for the Primary and Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
One interim analysis and a final analysis were planned for OS. The interim analysis of OS was to be 
performed at the time of the rPFS final analysis (i.e., when at least 262 rPFS events had occurred). The 
exact significance level for this analysis, calculated using the O’Brien-Fleming alpha spending function 
[Lan & DeMets, 1983], was used to determine the stopping boundaries based on the number of events 
observed at the interim analysis and control the overall 2-sided alpha at 0.05 or at 0.04. If the interim 
analysis of OS was not statistically significant, the final analysis of OS was planned for when 
approximately 342 deaths were observed to ensure an adequate number of events. At the time of the 
planned final analysis of OS, no additional analyses of other efficacy endpoints were to be conducted. 
Additional secondary endpoint analyses 
Time to first SSE, time to castration resistance, time to deterioration of QoL based on FACT-P and time to 
pain progression were to be analysed using the same analysis methods as for rPFS. All QoL assessment 
data were also summarized descriptively by study visit.

Figure 1. Patient disposition (All randomised patients) 
A total of 1146 (99.7%) patients received at least 1 dose of study drug (572 [99.7%] in the enzalutamide 
plus ADT group and 574 [99.7%] in the placebo plus ADT group) and were included in the safety 
population. A total of 769 (66.9%) patients remained on study drug as of the data cut-off date (437 
[76.1%] in the enzalutamide plus ADT group and 332 [57.6%] in the placebo plus ADT group. 
Recruitment 
From 21 March 2016 to 14 October 2018 (the study data cut-off date), 1150 patients were randomly 
assigned at a 1:1 ratio to treatment with enzalutamide plus ADT (574 patients) or placebo plus ADT (576 
patients); 1146 patients received at least 1 dose of enzalutamide plus ADT (572 patients) or placebo plus

ADT (574 patients). There were 204 study sites in 24 countries in North and South America, Europe, the 
Asia-Pacific region and Israel that randomised patients in this study. The countries with the highest 
patient enrolment were the Russian Federation (139, 12.1%), the US (122, 10.6%), Japan (92, 8.0%) 
and Slovakia (81,7.0%). Enrolment by site ranged from 1 to 40 patients.

Protocol amendments 
The original study protocol was dated 10 Nov 2015. There were 6 amendments to the protocol, including 
3 substantial amendments. Major changes from the substantial amendments are summarised below. 
Substantial Amendment 1 (dated 02 Jun 2016) included the following major changes:  
1.  Added 2 exclusion criteria to exclude patients who had not received bisphosphonates or denosumab 
at a stable dose (unless diagnosed with osteoporosis) and exclude patients who had shown a 
hypersensitivity reaction to any of the study capsule components. 
2.  Revised test drug information to remove information related to tablet formulations and add 
information related to the capsule formulation of study drug and placebo (chemical name, 
physical description and storage requirements). 
Substantial Amendment 2 (dated 14 Dec 2017) included the following major changes:  
1.  Revised the number of events required for the primary endpoint to reflect that primary analysis was 
to occur when 262 rPD events were confirmed by independent central imaging review. All 
secondary endpoints were to be evaluated at the time of primary analysis  
2.  Specified a step-wise approach for the statistical testing of the key secondary endpoints. To maintain 
the family-wise 2-sided type I error rate at 0.05, a parallel testing strategy between OS (with 
allocated type I error rate 0.04) and the other 4 endpoints (with allocated type I error rate 0.01) 
was developed. If the interim results of the OS analysis were statistically significant, no further 
analysis of OS would be completed.  
3.  Specified that unblinding of study treatment assignment could have been performed if a patient 
discontinued due to disease progression and in the investigator’s opinion this information was 
necessary to determine the next course of therapy.  
Substantial Amendment 3 (dated 10 Dec 2018) included the following major changes:  
1.  Added an open-label extension period. Following unblinding at the end of the double-blind period and 
demonstration of a statistically significant advantage of enzalutamide over placebo when added to 
Assessment report

Page 27/100 
 
 
  
  
 
ADT, as assessed by the primary endpoint, all eligible patients could be treated on study with 
open-label enzalutamide at the discretion of the patient and investigator.  
2.  Specific QoL assessments related to deterioration of urinary symptoms and QoL were added to the 
secondary endpoints.  
The majority of patients were enrolled under Protocol Version 2.0 incorporating Substantial Amendment 1 
Table 6.  
Table 6. Number of Patients Enrolled by Protocol Version (All Patients) 
Three country-specific non-substantial protocol amendments were implemented during the study. A non-
substantial amendment was implemented on 21 Apr 2016 to require a histological diagnosis of 
adenocarcinoma of the prostate (in inclusion criterion 3) for entry into the study in France. A second non-
substantial amendment was also implemented on 21 Apr 2016 to provide a concise summary of risk-
benefit assessment and modify the risk mitigation strategy that the sponsor would maintain throughout 
the study to ensure safety of the subjects. A third and final non-substantial amendment was implemented 
on 04 Oct 2017 for Canada and the US. An exploratory objective to assess genetic mutations related to 
resistance of enzalutamide plus ADT was added to the study protocol. Gene mutations were to be 
assessed in plasma samples requiring an additional 10mL of blood to be collected at randomization, week 
49, and at study treatment discontinuation. This applied only to those patients who consented to 
participate in this optional, exploratory analysis. 
Protocol deviations 
A total of 152 (13.2%) patients, 70 (12.2%) in the enzalutamide plus ADT group and 82 (14.2%) in the 
placebo plus ADT group, had 1 or more major protocol deviations during the study.  
Major protocol deviations are grouped into the following 4 categories:  
1.  PD1 Entered into the study even though they did not satisfy entry criteria  
2.  PD2 Developed withdrawal criteria during the study and was not withdrawn  
3.  PD3 Received wrong treatment or incorrect dose  
4.  PD4 Received excluded concomitant treatment 
Table 7. Summary of Major Protocol Deviations (All Randomized Patients) 
Assessment report  
EMA/202601/2021 
Page 28/100 
 
 
  
  
 
Additionally, after database lock the sponsor was notified that 2 patients at 1 site each received the 
incorrect treatment (1 patient in the placebo group received enzalutamide, 1 patient in the enzalutamide 
group received placebo) for approximately 3 months between 2 study visits.  
Protocol deviations categorised with respect to violations of inclusion/exclusion criteria are presented in 
Table 8. The most frequently violated criterion was exclusion criterion 1 (Patient had received any prior 
pharmacotherapy, radiation therapy or surgery for metastatic prostate cancer) occurring in 38 (3.3%) 
patients in total, followed by exclusion criterion 17 (Patient had clinically significant cardiovascular 
disease) in 12 (1.0%) patients, inclusion criterion 4 (Patient had metastatic prostate cancer documented 
by positive bone scan or metastatic lesions on CT or MRI scan) in 12 (1.0%) patients and exclusion 
criterion 11 (Patient had absolute neutrophil count <1500/μL, platelet count <100000/μL or haemoglobin 
<10 g/dL [6.2 mmol/L] at screening) in 11 (1.0%) patients. All other inclusion/exclusion criteria 
violations occurred in <1% of patients in total.

Numbers analysed 
The final analysis of rPFS was conducted with 287 rPFS events. The data cut-off date for the final analysis 
was 14 Oct 2018. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
rPD was defined by RECIST 1.1 for soft tissue disease or the appearance of 2 or more new bone lesions 
on bone scan. Unconfirmed disease progression on a bone scan at week 13 was not to be considered an 
event. The study-specified documentation and confirmation required for the determination of rPD are 
listed in Table 4. However, the ICR did not follow Table 4 for bone scans and reported disease progression 
based on bone scan according to PCWG2 criteria [Scher et al, 2008] instead. The ICR assessed 
radiographic progression on bone scan solely on the appearance of bone lesion(s) which were new 
compared to baseline of week 13.  
Treatment with enzalutamide plus ADT demonstrated a statistically significant 61% reduction in the risk 
of a patient experiencing an rPFS event compared with placebo plus ADT treatment (HR=0.39 [95% CI: 
0.30, 0.50]; P<0.0001). This analysis is based upon the data provided by the ICR.. 
rPFS data were censored for a higher proportion of patients in the enzalutamide plus ADT group 
compared with the placebo plus ADT group (84.49% vs 65.63%). In both treatment groups, the most 
frequent reason for censoring rPFS data was that there was no evidence of radiographic disease 
progression at the data cut-off date (448/485 [92.37%] for the enzalutamide plus ADT group vs 348/378 
[92.06%] for the placebo plus ADT group).

line ADT for metastatic prostate cancer. The study is being led by ANZUP Cancer Trials Group in 
collaboration with the University of Sydney (sponsor) acting through the National Health and Medical 
Research Council Clinical Trials Centre (NHMRC CTC). 
Methods 
Patients were randomized 1:1 to enzalutamide 160 mg daily by mouth or a conventional nonsteroidal 
antiandrogen -NSAA (bicalutamide, nilutamide or flutamide) by mouth; all patients were also treated with 
an LHRH analogue or surgical castration. Patients were allowed up to 6 cycles of concomitant docetaxel 
(75 mg/m2), as long as the decision to use early docetaxel was made and specified prior to randomisation 
and the patients received no more than 2 cycles prior to randomisation.  
Treatment was to continue until disease progression or prohibitive toxicity.  
Randomisation was stratified for volume of disease (high vs low), study site, concomitant antiresorptive 
therapy (yes vs no), comorbidities according to the Adult Comorbidity Evaluation [ACE-27] score (0 to 1 
vs 2 to 3) and early planned use of docetaxel (yes vs no). High volume of disease was defined as 4 or 
more bone metastases, 1 of which was outside the vertebral column and pelvis and/or visceral 
metastases. Lymph node involvement of bladder invasion did not qualify as visceral disease. 
Antiresorptive therapy referred to concomitant therapy to delay skeletal-related events when 
commencing ADT (denosumab, zoledronic acid or any other therapy at doses proven to prevent skeletal-
related events). ACE-27 score intervals of 0 to 1 vs 2 to 3 were used for the stratification. Early planned 
use of docetaxel was defined as the use of docetaxel in conjunction with initiation of ADT.

Eligible patients had metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate defined by documented histopathology or 
cytopathology of prostate adenocarcinoma from a biopsy of a metastatic site; or documented 
histopathology of prostate adenocarcinoma from a transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy, radical 
prostatectomy or transurethral resection of the prostate and metastatic disease consistent with prostate 
cancer; or metastatic disease typical of prostate cancer (i.e., involving bone or pelvic lymph nodes or

para-aortic lymph nodes) and a serum PSA concentration that is rising and is >20 ng/mL, have received 
prior ADT or prior cytotoxic chemotherapy for prostate cancer, with the following exceptions:  
- 
- 
ADT could have been started <12 weeks prior to randomization, with PSA stable or falling. 
Prior ADT was allowed in the adjuvant setting, where the completion of adjuvant hormonal 
therapy was >12 months prior to randomisation and the total duration of hormonal treatment did 
not exceed 24 months.  
-  Up to 2 cycles of docetaxel chemotherapy for metastatic disease were permitted prior to 
randomisation; continued treatment with docetaxel was allowed for a total of up to 6cycles. 
The primary objective was to determine the effect of enzalutamide plus ADT on OS (defined as death 
from any cause). Secondary objectives were to determine the effects of enzalutamide plus ADT on the 
following: PSA PFS (based on the first evidence of PSA progression, clinical progression or death from any 
cause), clinical PFS (based on evidence of radiographic progression using PCWG2 for bone lesions and 
RECIST 1.1 for soft tissue, development of symptoms attributable to cancer progression or initiation of 
another anticancer treatment for prostate cancer), Adverse Events (AEs) and HRQoL (utilizing European 
Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30, QLQ-PR25 and 
EQ-5D-5L health questionnaires). 
The primary analysis population for efficacy was the ITT population, defined as all randomised patients. 
The ITT population was analysed by treatment group according to study treatment assigned at the time 
of randomization. 
The study design included a provision for up to 3 interim efficacy analyses on OS at 50%, 67% and 80% 
of the maximum number of events being sought (i.e., 470). The interim analyses allowed for early 
rejection of the null hypothesis according to an alpha spending function with an O’Brien-Fleming boundary 
shape.

Results 
From 31 Mar 2014 to 24 Mar 2017 (the last date of randomisation), 1,125 patients were randomly 
assigned at a 1:1 ratio to treatment with enzalutamide plus ADT (563 patients) or NSAA plus ADT (562 
patients); 1121 patients received at least 1 dose of enzalutamide plus ADT (563 patients) or NSAA plus 
ADT (558 patients) Figure 13. There were 79 study sites in 6 countries (Australia, Canada, Ireland, New 
Zealand, UK and the US) in 3 regions: Australia/New Zealand, Europe and North America.

Figure 13. Patient Disposition (All Randomised Patients) 
The original study protocol (dated 11 Nov 2013) was amended twice (07 Nov 2014 and 01 Mar 2018). 
Use of docetaxel was introduced with amendment 1 of the protocol.  
There were 134 patients (11.9%) who had at least 1 major protocol deviation. Protocol deviations were 
more frequent in the enzalutamide arm compared to the NSAA arm (16.2% vs 7.7%). Differences were 
mainly driven by PD4 (i.e. received excluded concomitant treatment) with only 2 (0.4%) patients in the 
control arm and 34 patients (6.0%) in the experimental arm. The higher number of protocol deviations 
observed in the enzalutamide arm was due to patients continuing prior anti-androgen therapy post-
randomisation (31 of the 34 deviations). In the majority of the cases (28/31), ADT therapy was 
discontinued within 7 days after randomisation.

For the analysis of OS, a total of 245 deaths occurred and included 102 deaths (18.1%) in the 
enzalutamide plus ADT group and 143 deaths (25.4%) in the NSAA plus ADT group. A statistically 
significant 33% reduction in the risk of death was observed in patients treated with enzalutamide plus 
ADT compared with a conventional NSAA plus ADT, with an HR of 0.67 (95%CI:0.52,0.86; P=0.002) 
Table 38]. This interim analysis, based on a median follow-up of 33.8 months, showed that the efficacy 
stopping boundary was crossed. There were not enough death events in either arm to estimate the 
median OS. Survival at 36 months was 79.7% in the enzalutamide plus ADT group vs 72.4% in the NSAA 
plus ADT group. A sensitivity analysis using a stratified log-rank test and Cox regression model showed 
an HR of 0.68 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.87, P=0.0008). 
The patients continue on-study and continue to be followed for survival; an updated OS analysis is 
currently planned when at least 470 deaths have been reported.

In addition to the extension of indication to include mHSPC the MAH has provided updated 5-year OS 
results from study PREVAIL in chemo-naïve mCRPC to update section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
PREVAIL was a multinational, randomised, double-blind, Phase 3, placebo-controlled study of 
enzalutamide in chemotherapy-naïve patients with mCRPC. The coprimary efficacy endpoints were OS 
and rPFS.

The first patient was randomly assigned on 28 Sep 2010 and the last patient was randomly assigned on 
07 Sep 2012. On 21 Oct 2013, after a protocol-specified interim analysis was performed following 
540 death events, the external independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) offered access to open-
label enzalutamide to patients randomly assigned to placebo. In Jan 2014, placebo-treated patients 
began crossing over to enzalutamide treatment in the open-label period of the study.  
As of the 5-year analysis data cut-off date of 30 Sep 2017, a total of 871 patients in the enzalutamide 
group, 844 patients in the placebo group and 234 patients on placebo who crossed over to enzalutamide 
received at least 1 dose or partial dose of study drug.  
The number of patients enrolled in the open-label extension or long-term follow-up of PREVAIL as of the 
5-year analysis data cut-off date of 30 Sep 2017 was 520 patients (59.6%) in the enzalutamide group 
and 435 patients (51.5%) in the placebo group. 
As of the 5-year analysis data cut-off date of 30 Sep 2017, 62 patients (7.1%) in the enzalutamide group 
and 26 placebo patients (11.1%) who crossed over to enzalutamide were still receiving study treatment. 
As of the 5-year analysis data cut-off date, the number of patients who had come off their primary 
treatment and continued in long-term follow-up for OS included 157 patients (18.0%) in the 
enzalutamide group, 53 patients (6.3%) in the placebo group and 63 placebo patients (26.9%) who 
crossed over to enzalutamide. 
Table 39. Summary of Patients Enrolled in the PREVAIL Open-label Extension
The median treatment duration was 17.7 months for the enzalutamide group, 4.6 months for the placebo 
group and 9.8 months on enzalutamide for patients who crossed over from placebo. Most patients in the 
enzalutamide group (591[67.9%]) received study drug for at least 12 months and most patients in the 
placebo group (526 [62.3%]) received study drug for less than 6 months. Approximately 37% of 
enzalutamide-treated patients received study drug for at least 2 years. Approximately 20% of placebo 
patients who crossed over to enzalutamide received enzalutamide for at least 2 years.

The incidence of subsequent antineoplastic therapy use for prostate cancer was lower in the enzalutamide 
group (610 patients [70.0%]) compared with the placebo group (678 patients [80.2%]), reflective of the 
higher proportion of patients in the placebo group who had disease progression compared with the 
enzalutamide group The most common subsequent antineoplastic therapies for prostate cancer were 
docetaxel (481 enzalutamide patients [55.2%], 520 placebo patients [61.5%]), abiraterone acetate (362 
enzalutamide patients [41.5%], 431 placebo patients [51.0%]) and cabazitaxel (151 enzalutamide 
patients [17.3%], 172 placebo patients [20.4%]).

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Enzalutamide is currently approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic (pre and post 
chemotherapy) and non-metastatic CRPC (see SmPC section 4.1). Enzalutamide is an androgen receptor 
inhibitor that targets the AR signalling pathway. Within this application the MAH is seeking approval for 
the treatment of patients with metastatic prostate cancer prior to development of castration resistant 
disease (i.e., hormone-sensitive prostate cancer) in combination with ADT.  
Additionally, the MAH proposes an update in section 5.1 of the SmPC based on the 5-year overall survival 
(OS) results obtained from the PREVAIL (MD V310003) study, a phase 3 study of enzalutamide in 
chemotherapy naïve patients with metastatic prostate cancer that progressed on ADT. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The submission of this type II variation for the extension of indication is based on the Study 9785-CL-
0335 (ARCHES), a Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of enzalutamide plus ADT 
versus placebo plus ADT in 1,150 patients with mHSPC. Additionally, OS results from the first interim 
analysis of the study ENZAMET, a Phase 3, randomised, open-label, active-comparator study of 
enzalutamide plus ADT versus nonsteroidal antiandrogen (NSAA) plus ADT led by ANZUP Cancer Trials 
Group in collaboration with the University of Sydney as sponsor, have been provided as supportive 
information.  
Focusing on the Study ARCHES, eligibility criteria allowed the inclusion of patients with metastatic 
adenocarcinoma of the prostate (newly diagnosed or diagnosed in a previous stage), regardless of volume 
disease. Patients with an ECOG performance status >1 and those with known or suspected brain 
metastasis or active leptomeningeal disease and with history of seizure or any condition that may 
predispose to seizure were excluded from the study. Patients who have received up to 6 cycles of 
docetaxel and prior treatment with ADT (either LHRH agonists or antagonists or orchiectomy with or 
without concurrent antiandrogens), up to 3 months (6 months if patient was treated with docetaxel), and  
patients who have received prior ADT in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting (up to 39 months in 
duration)were allowed in the trial.  Moreover, 1 course of palliative radiation or surgical therapy to treat

EMA/202601/2021 
Page 67/100 
 
 
  
  
 
 
symptoms from metastatic disease were allowed. No other prior treatment for the metastatic disease was 
allowed.  
Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to enzalutamide (160 mg once daily) + ADT or matching placebo 
+ ADT. While the use of ADT alone as comparator could be acceptable in this setting, the add-on of 
docetaxel might have been a preferable choice, as it was suggested in the CHMP scientific advice 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/596561/2015). Based on the STAMPEDE and CHAARTED trials, in which docetaxel plus 
ADT improved OS in men with metastatic, hormone-naïve disease (Sweeney C, 2014; James ND, 2015), 
ADT plus docetaxel with or without prednisone or prednisolone is currently authorised for the treatment of 
patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (Docetaxel EPAR). 
Patients were stratified by prior docetaxel (none, 1-5 cycles, 5 cycles), and disease volume (low vs high). 
Radiographic PFS (rPFS), as assessed by ICR, was chosen as the primary endpoint. Radiographic 
progression disease (rPD) was defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria for soft tissue and by the appearance of 2 
or more new bone lesions on bone scan. The assessment of rPFS was performed at week 13 and 
thereafter every 12 weeks. As per protocol, if progression was identified at week 13 (bone lesion), 
confirmation was required ≥ 6 weeks after that or at week 25 visit. The latter is considered appropriate to 
avoid false positive of progression. Progression was to be confirmed if there were ≥ 2 new bone lesions 
on bone scan compared to week 13 scan (≥ 4 new lesions compared to baseline bone scan). At week 25 
or later no confirmatory scan was required for bone lesions and rPD on bone scans was planned to be 
assessed by comparison to best response on treatment. However, according to the applicant the ICR 
assessed rPD on bone scan solely on the appearance of bone lesion(s) which were new compared to 
baseline or to week 13 (i.e. according to PCWG2 criteria – Scher et al, 2008). This analysis was initially 
planned as a sensitivity analysis but not as the primary analysis. This was considered a major deviation 
from the protocol and statistical analysis plan (SAP), and matter of concern. According to the MAH this 
change in the method of analysis was due to an unintentional error which affected 66 of the 1150 
patients included in the ARCHES study. A GCP inspection was conducted and no findings impacting 
negatively the data quality were identified. 
Overall, secondary endpoints are considered acceptable, although the addition of PFS2 as a secondary 
endpoint would have been informative. It should be pointed out that “time to deterioration in urinary 
symptoms” was added as a secondary endpoint with amendment 3 (dated 10 Dec 2018), after the data 
cut-off. Nevertheless, according to the MAH the inclusion of “time to deterioration in urinary symptoms” 
as a secondary endpoint was included in the final version of the SAP, dated 15 Nov 2018, while data were 
still unblinded (database lock 14 Dec 2018).  
Overall, the statistical methods seem appropriate. The efficacy analyses were performed on the ITT 
population. The primary efficacy endpoint is the rPFS with a multiplicity control for the 6 key secondary 
endpoints, including OS once rPFS was demonstrated to be statistically significant. Key secondary 
endpoints, other than OS, were sequentially tested at a 1% significance level.  
A total of 152 (13.2%) patients (70 [12.2%] in the enzalutamide arm and 82 [14.2%] in the placebo 
arm) had 1 or more major protocol deviations during the study and the majority of them were related to 
violation of inclusion criteria. Overall, percentages of major protocol deviations were balanced between 
treatment arms, apart from the violation of the  exclusion criterion 1 (Patient had received any prior 
pharmacotherapy, radiation therapy or surgery for metastatic prostate cancer), where the proportion of 
patients in the control arm was double compared to the enzalutamide arm (26 [4.5%] vs 12 [2.1%], 
respectively. Exclusion criterion 1 deviations more frequent in the placebo plus ADT group compared to 
the enzalutamide plus ADT group were: treated with docetaxel and received >6 months ADT prior to day 
1, received > 3 months of ADT prior to day 1,and had final administration of docetaxel >2 months prior 
to day 1. No patterns have been identified to explain the larger number of deviations in the placebo plus

ADT group vs enzalutamide plus ADT group. Taking into account the small number of patients and the 
results observed, this imbalance does not appear to have a great impact on the results. 
Regarding baseline characteristics, the population was balanced between treatment arms. The median 
age was 70 years (range: 42, 92), with nearly 30% of patients being 75 years or older. The majority of 
patients were white (80.5%) and had a good performance status (77.5% ECOG 0). The majority of 
patients had high volume of disease (63%) and a Gleason score at initial diagnosis ≥8 (66%). Median 
serum PSA was 5.21 ng/ml, with some patients with a PSA level of 0. The mean PSA at baseline for 
enzalutamide group was 75.37 ng/ml which may question whether the population was castration 
sensitive. However, patients with evidence of disease progression (i.e. radiographic or PSA) in the context 
of ADT were excluded from the study, thus the population included in study ARCHES can be considered 
castration sensitive.  
Most of the patients had distant metastasis at diagnosis (66.7%). The majority of patients received prior 
treatment with ADT (90%) and around 18% of patients received prior treatment with docetaxel. Other 
prior therapies included radiation (16.5%) and surgery (33.5%). A high number of patients received 
subsequent antineoplastic therapy for prostate cancer in the control arm compared to the enzalutamide 
arm (8.0% vs 23.1%), which seems reasonable taking into account the results of the primary analysis. 
Docetaxel (1.9% vs 9.0%), abiraterone (2.3% vs 4.9%) and enzalutamide (0.7% vs 4.9%) were the 
most commonly used subsequently in the control arm. 
The study ENZAMET included a total of 1,125 patients who were randomised 1:1 to treatment with 
enzalutamide plus ADT (563 patients) or NSAA plus ADT (562 patients). Randomisation was stratified for 
volume of disease (high vs low), study site, concomitant antiresorptive therapy (yes vs no), comorbidities 
according to the ACE-27 score (0 to 1 vs 2 to 3) and early planned use of docetaxel (yes vs no). 
The primary endpoint was OS without multiplicity control for the secondary endpoints. Three interim 
analyses were proposed for OS, once 50%, 67% and 80% of the required events were observed. An 
alpha spending function with an O’Brien-Fleming boundary shape was used with a final alpha value of 
0.042. The ENZAMET study design is overall considered adequate. 
The population included in the study ENZAMET is not completely comparable to the population of ARCHES 
study. Patients in the study ENZAMET could receive early docetaxel use (i.e. a total of 6 cycles of 
docetaxel, of which 0-2 cycles were allowed before randomisation) while in the study ARCHES treatment 
with docetaxel was only allowed prior randomisation (i.e. up to 6 cycles of docetaxel therapy with final 
treatment administration completed within 2 months of day 1) (see Table 29). According to the data 
provided by the MAH, 45.1% of patients in the enzalutamide arm in study ENZAMET had early docetaxel 
use (i.e. use of docetaxel in conjunction with initiation of ADT), of whom approximately 43% received at 
least 1 dose of early docetaxel. Moreover, 15.8% of patients received docetaxel for metastatic disease 
prior to randomisation.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The primary analysis of study ARCHES was performed at the data cut-off date of 14 Oct 2018. This was 
the only planned analysis for rPFS (primary endpoint) and the first interim analysis for OS (secondary 
endpoint).  
With 287 rPFS events (89 [15.51%] in the enzalutamide arm and 198 [34.38%] in the placebo arm), 
based on ICR assessment, the study met its primary objective with a HR of 0.39 (95% CI: 0.3, 0.5). 
Median rPFS was not reached in the enzalutamide arm and was of 19.4 months in the placebo arm. 
According to Kaplan-Meier plot, the benefit of adding enzalutamide to ADT treatment is observed after the 
third month, when the curves separate and maintained separated thereafter. rPFS data is however not

very mature, with nearly 85% and 66% censoring in the enzalutamide and placebo arms, respectively. 
The main reason for censoring in both arms was no rPFS event at the data cut-off date.  
As previously mentioned, results of the primary analysis were based on IRC assessment as per PCWG2 
criteria (against of what was specified in the protocol). A reanalysis of rPFS as per protocol was also 
provided. Results of this analysis were in line with the primary analysis (HR 0.39 [95% CI: 0.30, 0.50]), 
with 91 events (15.85%) in the enzalutamide plus ADT group and 201 (34.9%) in the placebo plus ADT 
group. Median PFS was not reached in the enzalutamide arm and was 19.0 months [95% CI: 16.59, 
22.24]. 
Subgroup analyses for the primary endpoint showed consistent results in all subgroup analysed, including 
the subgroup of patients previously treated with docetaxel. The MAH was requested to provide rPFS data 
for both newly diagnosed patients (i.e. patients whose initial diagnosis of prostate cancer was within 3 
months of the first dose of randomized treatment) and recurrent disease patients (i.e. patients with prior 
local treatment) (data not shown). Overall, rPFS results in both subgroups were consistent with that of 
the overall population.  
Moreover, several sensitivity analyses of rPFS were performed and all of them supported the primary 
analysis. The sensitivity analysis analysing rPFS based on investigator´s assessment, in principle 
according to the protocol-specified criteria, showed a HR of 0.46 [95% CI: 0.36, 0.59]), with a 
concordance rate between the ICR and the investigator of around 90%.  
OS was a secondary endpoint in study ARCHES. OS was assessed based on an allocated 2-sided alpha of 
0.04. For the first interim analysis the stopping boundary was 0.0000054. At the time of the data cut-off 
date, the number of deaths was 84 (39 [6.8%] in the enzalutamide arm and 45 [7.8%] in the placebo 
arm). Considering the immaturity of data, median OS was not reached in any arm and while a 
detrimental effect on OS is excluded, the statistical significance was not reached (HR 0.81 [95% CI: 0.53, 
1.25]; p=0.3361). Therefore, the MAH is recommended to provide updated OS data when available. Final 
OS results are expected by March 2022 (REC).   
Other main secondary endpoints were: time to PSA progression, time to start of a new antineoplastic 
therapy, PSA undetectable rate, ORR and time to deterioration in urinary symptoms. The prespecified 
level of significance for these key secondary endpoints was 0.01. Overall, all these secondary endpoints 
favoured the enzalutamide arm, with statistically significant results, except for the time to deterioration in 
urinary symptoms (HR 0.88 [95% CI: 0.72, 1.08]; p=0.2162) where no statistically significant 
differences were observed between treatment arms.  
In addition, time to symptomatic skeletal event, time to castration resistance, quality of life and time to 
pain progression (assessed by BPI-SF) were also assessed as secondary endpoints, although the “p” 
values provided were only for descriptive purposes and should not be used to assess statistical 
significance. Adding enzalutamide to ADT treatment appears to delay time to castration resistance and 
time to first symptomatic skeletal event. However, there seems to be no differences in terms of time to 
deterioration of QoL or time to progression between treatments arms. 
The ENZAMET study has been provided to support the results of the ARCHES study. Within this 
application the MAH is providing results of the first OS interim analysis. No additional efficacy data have 
been submitted. 
This first interim analysis for OS was conducted when 245 events had occurred (52% of 470 planned 
events for the final analysis). OS analysis was statistically significant, since the pre-specified alpha 
boundary of 0.003 was crossed (HR 0.669 [95% CI: 0.518, 0.862]; p=0.0018; unstratified analysis). 
Assessment report  
EMA/202601/2021 
Page 70/100 
 
 
  
  
However, these data are considered immature (82% and 75% of censures in the experimental and 
control arm, respectively) and median OS had not been reached in either treatment arm. At the time of 
the data cut-off, the median follow-up time was 14.4 months in ARCHES vs. 33.8 months in ENZAMET. 
With regard to subgroup analysis, an apparently lack of benefit was observed in the subgroup of patients 
receiving early treatment with docetaxel (HR 0.9 [95% CI: 0.615, 1.315]), especially in those patients 
with high volume of disease (HR 0.967 [95% CI: 0.638, 1.464]). Moreover, a similar pattern is observed 
in the subgroup of patients with visceral disease (HR 1.048 [95% CI: 0.542, 2.028]), concomitant use of 
anti-resorptive therapy (HR 1.767 [95% CI: 0.837, 3.890]) and the subgroup of European patients (HR 
1.041 [95% CI: 0.572, 1.891]). However, data are limited due to the low number of events. 
In the subgroup of patients not receiving early treatment with docetaxel, which may be more similar to 
the population of study ARCHES, the results were in line with the primary analysis (HR 0.528 [95% CI: 
0,370, 0,743]). 
Despite the inherent limitations of subgroup analyses, it is considered that the data from the subgroup of 
patients without planned early use of docetaxel can be considered convincing in accordance with the 
Guideline on the investigation of subgroups in confirmatory clinical trials (EMA/CHMP/539146/2013) and 
therefore supportive of the current application. 
Within this submission the MAH has also provided 5-year OS data from the study PREVAIL. The study 
PREVAIL was a randomised, double-blind, Phase 3 study in 1,717 patients with metastatic castration 
resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who were chemotherapy naïve. Patients were randomised in a 1:1 
ratio to receive either enzalutamide [160 mg once daily] (n=872) or placebo (n=845). In this study, OS 
and rPFS were co-primary efficacy endpoints.  
An interim analysis for OS was performed when 540 events had occurred, in which enzalutamide 
demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS compared to placebo (HR 0.706 [95% CI: 
0.60, 0.84]). After this specified interim analysis, the patients randomly assigned to placebo have been 
offered by the independent DMC to pass to the enzalutamide treatment in the open-label period of the 
study.  
Through this variation, the MAH has provided 5-year OS data based on data cut-off date of 30 Sep 2017. 
At the data cut-off, the number of patients enrolled in the open-label extension period was 520 (59.6%) 
in the enzalutamide arm and 435 (51.5%) in the placebo arm. There were 234 patients (27,7%) on 
placebo who crossed over to enzalutamide and received at least one dose or partial dose of study drug. 
Results of this final analysis, when 1,382 deaths had occurred (689 [79.0%] in the enzalutamide arm and 
693 [82%] in the placebo arm), were statistically significant, with a HR of 0.835 [95% CI: 0.751, 0.928] 
and a OS median of 35.5 months in the enzalutamide arm versus 31.4% in the placebo arm.  
These results confirm the clinical benefit of enzalutamide over placebo in the treatment of patients with 
mCRPC chemotherapy naïve.  
These results do not change the benefit/risk ratio (B/R) for enzalutamide and have been adequately 
reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. The B/R of enzalutamide remains positive. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In study ARCHES a statistically significant 61% reduction in the risk of an rPFS event was observed for 
enzalutamide + ADT compared to placebo + ADT [HR = 0.39 (95% CI: 0.30, 0.50); p < 0.0001].

There is no indication of detrimental effect in survival. Nevertheless, the OS data are immature and the 
MAH is recommended to provide updated OS data from study ARCHES.  
The results of study ARCHES are supported by preliminary results from a subgroup of patients from study 
ENZAMET which is close to the population enrolled in study ARCHES. 
Regarding results of study PREVAIL, data with a 5-year follow up confirm the clinical benefit of 
enzalutamide in the treatment of patients with mCRPC chemotherapy naïve.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety profile of enzalutamide (MDV3100, ASP9785) in support of its use for the treatment of patients 
with mHSPC, is based on the safety results from the pivotal study ARCHES (9785-CL-0335). In addition to 
the ARCHES study, safety data from the following studies have been included: 
•  A Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled study in patients with metastatic CRPC previously treated 
with docetaxel-based chemotherapy (AFFIRM [CRPC2]). 
• 
• 
Two  phase  3  randomised,  placebo-controlled,  studies  in  chemotherapy-naïve  patients  with 
metastatic CRPC (PREVAIL [MDV3100-03] and Asian PREVAIL [9785-CL-0232]). The PREVAIL study 
provides long-term follow-up data (after all patients have been followed for a minimum of 5 years, 
died, or were otherwise lost to follow-up or had withdrawn consent). In the Asian PREVAIL study, 
data from Site 105 was excluded due to data quality concerns. 
Two  randomised,  bicalutamide-controlled,  phase  2  studies  in  patients  with  metastatic  CRPC 
(TERRAIN [9785-CL-0222]) and with nonmetastatic or metastatic CRPC (STRIVE [MDV3100-09]). 
•  A phase 3 randomised, placebo-controlled study in patients with nonmetastatic CRPC (PROSPER 
[MDV3100-14]). 
•  A phase 3 randomised, study in patients with mHSPC receiving treatment with first-line medical or 
surgical  ADT  and  optional  concurrent  docetaxel  for  metastatic  prostate  cancer  (ENZAMET).  As 
ENZAMET was an investigator-initiated study conducted by a collaborative group (Australian and 
New  Zealand  Urogenital  and  Prostate  Cancer  Trials  Group  Ltd.  [ANZUP])  that  maintains  the 
database for the study, these data are presented standalone as the safety data in this study were 
not collected/handled in the same way as the other studies. Only grade 3 and 4 adverse events 
(AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) of any severity and death data are presented for the ENZAMET 
study. 
Safety data are summarised for ARCHES and 2 pools of studies with the presentation of a total of 5 groups 
in order to provide a comprehensive summary of the clinical safety of enzalutamide in these studies.

In the ARCHES study, TEAEs leading to death were reported in 14 (2.4%) patients in the enzalutamide plus 
ADT group and 10 (1.7%) patients in the placebo plus ADT group. No patient in the enzalutamide plus ADT 
group had a fatal TEAE that was considered to be study drug-related. One patient in the placebo plus ADT 
group had a TEAE leading to death that was considered by the investigator to be study drug-related (general 
physical health deterioration).  
In the phase 3 studies in patients with CRPC, TEAEs leading to death were reported in 127 (4.5%) patients 
in the enzalutamide group; 5 patients had TEAEs leading to death that were considered by the investigator 
to be study drug-related. 
In  the  ARCHES  study,  preferred  terms  leading  to  death  in  ≥  2  patients  were  malignant  neoplasm 
progression (4 [0.7%] patients in the enzalutamide plus ADT group and 2 [0.3%] patients in the placebo 
plus ADT group) and pulmonary embolism (2 [0.3%] patients in the enzalutamide plus ADT group).

Post marketing experience 
In Europe, enzalutamide was initially approved in June 2013, but was made available in France through a 
temporary authorization for use from April 2013.  
The enzalutamide post-marketing exposure estimates are based on internal sales data for all countries.

Seven PSURs for Xtandi (enzalutamide) have been submitted to regulatory authorities since August 2012. 
In the current PSUR (dated 29 October 2018), a cumulative review and evaluation of post-marketing 
ADRs for enzalutamide was performed for all cases reported through 30 August 2018. Cumulatively, a 
total of 107540 ADRs have been reported from post-marketing data sources. During the reporting period 
for PSUR (dated 29 October 2018), an assessment of post-marketing events revealed no safety concerns 
related to the following important identified risks (seizure, PRES, hypertension, neutrophil count 
decreased, cognitive/memory impairment, fall and nonpathological fracture) and the following important 
identified interactions (interactions with strong inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 and 
interactions with medicinal products that are substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19) listed in the 
current enzalutamide EU risk management plan (v 12.5, 15 November 2018). 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of enzalutamide in patients with mHSPC is based mainly on data from the pivotal Phase 
3 study ARCHES in which 1,146 patients were treated with either enzalutamide + ADT (n=572) or 
placebo + ADT (n=574). Additionally, pooled data from 6 additional clinical trials (four Phase 3 placebo-
controlled studies in patients with CRPC and two Phase 2 studies in metastatic CRPC) have been provided. 
In total, the integrated safety population includes 4,081 patients treated with enzalutamide 160 mg/day 
plus standard of care. Of these, 24.7% had nonmetastatic prostate cancer and 75.3% had metastatic 
disease. Moreover, safety data from the Phase 3 study ENZAMET, have been provided separately. In 
study ENZAMET 563 patients were treated with enzalutamide + ADT and 558 patients with nonsteroidal 
antiandrogen + ADT. 
In the study ARCHES the median duration of treatment was 12.8 months in the enzalutamide arm and 
11.55 months in the placebo arm, with nearly 57% and 47% of patients being exposed ≥12 months to 
<24 months, in the enzalutamide and placebo arm, respectively. Only 7 patients (6 enzalutamide and 1 
placebo) received study drug ≥24 months. In the Phase 3 studies pool, the extent of exposure was 
longer, with 791 (28%) patients being exposed ≥24 months. To adjust for the duration of treatment, the 
event rate of AEs per 100 patient-years of exposure was also analysed (data not shown). At the time of 
the data cut-off date 76% of patients in the enzalutamide arm and 57% in the placebo arm were still on 
treatment.  
The study ARCHES included patients with a median age of 70 years [range: 42, 92] (30% were ≥ 75 
years). The majority of patients were White and had a good performance status (77.5% had ECOG 0). 
More than half of patients had a medical history of hypertension. Patients with any clinically significant 
cardiovascular disease as well as those with past history of seizure or any condition that may predispose 
to seizure were excluded from the study (see SmPC section 4.4).

Overall incidence of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was similar between treatment arms 
(>85%) although TEAEs considered related to study drug were more frequent in the enzalutamide arm 
(53% vs 47%). The most commonly reported (≥10%) TEAEs in the enzalutamide group were hot flush 
(27.1% enzalutamide vs 22.3% placebo), fatigue (19.6% vs 15.3%) and arthralgia (12.2% vs 10.6%).  
Grade 3 or higher TEAEs were reported in 24.3% of patients in the enzalutamide arm and 25.6% in the 
placebo arm. The most frequently reported TEAEs of grade ≥3 were hypertension (3.3% enzalutamide vs 
1.7% placebo), asthenia (1% vs 0.5%), malignant neoplasm progression (1% vs 0.5%) and syncope (1% 
vs 0.2%).  
TEAEs of special interest for enzalutamide are: seizure, hypertension, neutrophil count decreased, 
cognitive and memory impairment, ischemic heart disease, other selected cardiovascular events, PRES, 
secondary primary malignancies, falls, fracture, fatigue, loss of consciousness, thrombocytopenia, 
musculoskeletal events, severe cutaneous adverse reactions, angioedema and rash. TEAEs of special 
interest with a higher incidence (>2% or double) in the enzalutamide arm compared to placebo arm 
were: hypertension (8.6% vs 6.3%), cognitive and memory impairment (4.5% vs 2.1%), fatigue (24.1% 
vs 19.5%), fractures (6.5% vs 4.2%), loss of consciousness (1.6% vs 0.2%) and angioedema (1.2% vs 
0.2%). At study entry, more than half of patients had hypertension at baseline. Among these, the 
incidence of hypertension was 9% in the enzalutamide arm compared to 5.3% in the placebo arm.  
No events of PRES or severe cutaneous reactions were reported in the enzalutamide arm and there was 
one event of dermatitis bullous in the placebo arm. 
There were 2 (0.3%) events of seizure in each treatment arm. In the enzalutamide arm both events were 
considered to be related to study drug and led to treatment discontinuation. A warning on seizure is 
included in current the SmPC.  
Ischemic heart disease is included as an ADR in the SmPC. In study ARCHES, 10 (1.7%) patients in the 
enzalutamide arm (8 [1.4%] in the placebo arm) reported an event of ischemic heart disease, being 
angina pectoris the most frequently reported (4 [0.7%] enzalutamide vs none in the placebo arm). 
Additionally, there were 12 (2.3%) patients that reported other selected cardiovascular event, with 
cardiac failure as the most commonly reported. Cardiac failure was reported in 7 [1.2%] patients in the 
enzalutamide arm and 3 (0.5%) patients in the placebo arm. In most of these cases several confounding 
factors were present. However, the potential contribution of enzalutamide to events of cardiac failure 
cannot be ruled out taking into account that patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease were 
excluded from the study. Nevertheless, it is not possible to draw any conclusion on the possible causal 
relationship with enzalutamide based on the available data. Cardiac failure should be monitored through 
routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
In patients with a baseline history of other selected cardiovascular events (23.3% in the enzalutamide 
arm and 19.9% in the placebo arm), no differences were observed between treatment arms whereas in 
patients without a baseline history the incidence was higher in the enzalutamide arm (8 [1.4%] vs 3 
[0.5%]). Overall, the incidence of cardiovascular adverse events in study ARCHES was low, however, it 
should be taken into account that patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease (i.e. 
myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to screening, unstable angina within 3 months prior to 
screening, etc) were excluded from the study (See SmPC section 4.4).    
In the ARCHES study second primary malignancies were reported in 10 (1.7%) patients in the 
enzalutamide arm and 11 (1.9%) patients in the placebo arm. In previous Phase 3 clinical trials, the 
incidence of second primary malignancies in the enzalutamide arm compared to placebo was 2.9% vs 
0.9%, respectively. Despite the number of events reported is low, it should be kept in mind that 
enzalutamide has shown to be carcinogenic in non-clinical trials (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
In non-clinical trials, the most prominent neoplastic findings were benign Leydig cell tumours, urothelium 
Assessment report  
EMA/202601/2021 
Page 91/100 
 
 
  
  
papilloma, and carcinoma of urinary bladder. A similar pattern is observed in clinical trials. In the total 
enzalutamide population (n=4081) bladder cancer was the most frequently reported malignancy (9 
[0.2%]). The mechanism is not completely elucidated. Although a causal relationship is not formally 
established, the potential risk of enzalutamide to develop second primary malignancies, especially urinary 
bladder cancer, cannot be ruled out. Section 4.4 of the SmPC was recently updated 
(EMEA/H/C/002639/II/0049) to include a warning mentioning that patients should be advised to promptly 
seek the attention of their physician if they notice signs of gastrointestinal bleeding, macroscopic 
haematuria, or other symptoms such as dysuria or urinary urgency develop during treatment with 
enzalutamide. 
With regard to deaths, at the time of data cut-off, 39 (6.8%) patients in the enzalutamide arm and 
45 (7.8%) patients in the placebo arm had died. Disease progression was the leading cause in both 
treatment arms (4.5% vs 7.8%, enzalutamide and placebo, respectively). Deaths due to TEAEs were 
slightly higher in the enzalutamide arm (14 [2.4%] vs 10 [1.7%]). Malignant neoplasm progression was 
the leading cause (4 [0.7%] and there were 3 deaths related to cardiac disorders (cardio-respiratory 
arrest, cardiopulmonary failure and myocardial infarction). No patient in the enzalutamide plus ADT group 
had a fatal TEAE that was considered to be study drug-related. 
Serious TEAEs were reported by 18.2% of patients in the enzalutamide arm and 19.5% in the placebo 
group. In the enzalutamide arm, malignant neoplasm progression was the only serious TEAE reported in 
at least 1% of patients. Serious TEAEs were considered drug-related by the investigator in 22 (3.8%) 
patients in the enzalutamide plus ADT group and 16 patients (2.8%) patients in the placebo plus ADT 
group. 
Overall, enzalutamide appears to be well tolerated, taking into account the relatively low rate of 
treatment discontinuations (7.2% enzalutamide vs 5.2% placebo) as well as dose reductions (4.4% 
enzalutamide vs 1.9% placebo) and dose interruptions (7.3% enzalutamide vs 6.3% placebo). 
Regarding safety in special populations, no major differences in terms of TEAEs, SAEs and Grade ≥3 
TEAEs according to baseline weight, geographic region, history of hypertension, age and history of 
significant CV disease were observed (data not shown) Considering TEAEs of special interest, in the study 
ARCHES a slightly higher incidence of memory impairment was reported in the subgroup of patients ≥85 
years treated with enzalutamide. Memory impairment is a common adverse reaction included in section 
4.8 of the SmPC. 
During the procedure, updated safety data, with three months of additional follow-up, were provided for 
study ARCHES. At the time of the new data cut-off (3 Jan 2019), median treatment exposure in the 
enzalutamide+ADP arm was of 15.90 months and 13.80 months in the placebo+ADT arm (data not 
shown). No major differences were observed in the safety profile of enzalutamide plus ADT compared to 
previous data submitted, apart from a slight increase in the incidence of several TEAEs. However, this is 
not unexpected since updated data add only 3 months of additional follow-up. Therefore, and taking into 
account that a high percentage of patients remained on treatment at the time of the data cut-off (around 
71% in the enzalutamide plus ADT group) the MAH is recommended to provide an updated safety 
analysis with final results of the ARCHES study (REC). 
Overall, the safety profile of enzalutamide in the ARCHES study was in line with its already known safety 
profile. The incidence of adverse events was generally lower in the ARCHES study compared to Phase 3 
studies. Pharmacovigilance activities in place are considered sufficient to address the risks associated with 
enzalutamide. Within this application the MAH is also proposing a minor change in section 4.7 Effects on 
ability to drive and use machines of the SmPC which is considered in line with the safety profile of Xtandi.  
Moreover section point 6.6 of the SmPC has been updated to clarify to precaution of handling for woman 
who are or might become pregnant, in line with section 5.3 of the SmPC.

2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of enzalutamide in combination with ADT in the treatment of patients with 
mHSPC was in line with the already known safety profile of enzalutamide and no worrisome findings have 
been identified. However, considering a high number of patients remained on treatment at the time of the 
new data cut-off, an updated safety analysis is recommended to be provided with the final results of the 
ARCHES study.

has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: Results from 
the readability testing study of the parent package leaflet can be extrapolated to the daughter package 
leaflet as the differences between the two have little impact on readability. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed indication is for the treatment of adult men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate 
cancer (mHSPC) in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). 
For patients with this advanced stage of the disease, the aim of treatment is to improve the symptoms in 
particular pain and to extend the time during which the disease can be controlled with androgen 
deprivation therapy to delay progression.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
ADT has been the basis for the treatment of patients with locally advanced and metastatic HSPC. ADT is 
defined as surgical castration by bilateral orchiectomy or medical castration with gonadotropin-releasing 
hormone (GnRH) agonists or antagonists. The aim of ADT treatment is to reduce testosterone 
concentrations. Even though the majority of patients have an initial response to treatment with ADT, 
most men progress to castration-resistant prostate cancer. 
Treatment options for men with mHSPC have expanded beyond ADT alone. Docetaxel (75 mg/m2 every 3 
weeks for 6 cycles) has been shown to improve overall survival (OS) and failure-free survival (FFS) in 
patients with mHSPC in multiple studies, including CHAARTED and Arm C of the STAMPEDE trial and has 
been approved for the treatment of mHSPC.  
Furthermore, abiraterone in combination with ADT and prednisone or prednisolone was authorised in EU 
for the treatment of adult men with newly diagnosed high risk metastatic hormone sensitive prostate 
cancer. 
Recently apalutamide has also been approved in adult men for the treatment of metastatic hormone-
sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (see EPAR 
Erleada).  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The efficacy data in support of this application for the extension of indication is based mainly on the 
Study 9785-CL-0335 (ARCHES), a Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 
enzalutamide plus ADT versus placebo plus ADT in 1,150 patients with mHSPC.  
Assessment report  
EMA/202601/2021 
Page 95/100 
 
 
  
  
Patients received enzalutamide at 160 mg once daily (N=574) or placebo (N=576). Patients with 
metastatic prostate cancer documented by positive bone scan (for bone disease) or metastatic lesions on 
CT or MRI scan (for soft tissue) were eligible. Patients whose disease spread was limited to regional pelvic 
lymph nodes were not eligible. Patients were allowed to receive up to 6 cycles of docetaxel therapy with 
final treatment administration completed within 2 months of day 1 and no evidence of disease 
progression during or after the completion of docetaxel therapy. 
Radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), based on independent central review, was the primary 
endpoint defined as the time from randomisation to the first objective evidence of radiographic disease 
progression or death whichever occurred first. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Results from the study ARCHES at the data cut-off date of 14 Oct 2018 include the main planned analysis 
for rPFS based on independent central review assessment (primary endpoint) and the first interim 
analysis for OS (secondary endpoint).  
A statistically significant treatment effect on rPFS in favour of enzalutamide was observed, with a HR of 
0.39 (95% CI: 0.3, 0.5). At the time of data cut-off median rPFS was not reached in the enzalutamide 
arm and was of 19.0 months in the placebo arm. Overall, subgroup analysis and several sensitivity 
analyses performed support the results of the primary analysis. 
To adjust for multiplicity, a parallel testing strategy was used to test OS with an allocated type I error 
rate of 0.04 and the remaining 5 key secondary endpoints (time to PSA progression, time to start of a 
new antineoplastic therapy, rate of PSA decline to <0.2 ng/mL, ORR and time to deterioration in urinary 
symptoms from the QLQ-PR25) with an allocated type I error rate of 0.01.  
Statistically significant improvements in patients treated with enzalutamide compared to placebo were 
observed for all key secondary endpoints except time to deterioration in urinary symptoms from the QLQ-
PR25. 
Regarding OS, at the time of data cut-off, data were still immature and the statistical significance was not 
reached (HR 0.81 [95% CI: 0.53, 1.25]; p=0.3361). A trend in favour of enzalutamide was observed. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Based on OS analysis submitted at the data cut off 14 Oct 2018 on a total of 84 deaths (24.6% of the 
342 events required for the final analysis) the effect of enzalutamide on OS is uncertain. Nevertheless, 
based on the totality of data (effect on rPFS and secondary endpoint) a detrimental effect on OS can be 
excluded. Further OS data are expected to be submitted as soon as available (REC). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In the study ARCHES, the median duration of treatment was 12.8 months in the enzalutamide arm and 
11.55 months in the placebo arm.  
The most frequently reported (≥10%) TEAES in the enzalutamide arm were hot flush (27.1% 
enzalutamide vs 22.3% placebo) and fatigue (19.6% vs 15.3%).  
Grade 3 or higher TEAEs were reported by 24.3% of patients in the enzalutamide arm and 25.6% in the 
placebo arm. The most frequently reported TEAEs of grade ≥3 were hypertension (3.3% enzalutamide vs 
1.7% placebo), asthenia (1% vs 0.5%), malignant neoplasm progression (1% vs 0.5%) and syncope (1% 
vs 0.2%).  
Assessment report  
EMA/202601/2021 
Page 96/100 
 
 
  
  
Serious TEAEs were reported by 18.2% of patients in the enzalutamide arm and 19.5% in the placebo 
group. Serious TEAEs were considered drug-related by the investigator in 22 (3.8%) patients in the 
enzalutamide plus ADT group and 16 patients (2.8%) patients in the placebo plus ADT group. 
Treatment was discontinued due to a TEAE in 7.2% of patients in the enzalutamide arm and 5.2% in the 
placebo arm. Decreased appetite, diarrhoea and fatigue were the main TEAEs that led to treatment 
discontinuation.  
Dose reductions and dose interruptions were required, respectively, in 4.4% and 7.3% of patients in the 
enzalutamide arm compared to 1.9% and 6.3% of patients in the placebo arm. 
TEAEs of special interest for enzalutamide are: seizure, hypertension, neutrophil count decreased, 
cognitive and memory impairment, ischemic heart disease, other selected cardiovascular events 
(Hemorrhagic Central Nervous System Vascular Conditions, Ischemic Central Nervous System Vascular 
Conditions and Cardiac Failure), PRES, secondary primary malignancies, falls, fracture, fatigue, , 
thrombocytopenia, musculoskeletal events, severe cutaneous adverse reactions and rash.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Enzalutamide plus ADT has shown a clinically relevant increase in terms of rPFS. These results are 
supported by almost all key secondary endpoints and several sensitivity analyses.  
Nevertheless, the OS data are immature and the MAH is recommended to provide updated OS data from 
study ARCHES.  
Despite the immaturity of survival data, there is no indication of detrimental effect in survival.. In support 
of the results of study ARCHES, OS results from study ENZAMET at the first interim analysis were 
submitted.. Despite the inherent limitations of subgroup analyses, results in the subgroup of patients 
without planned early docetaxel treatment were considered convincing in accordance with the Guideline 
on the investigation of subgroups in confirmatory clinical trials (EMA/CHMP/539146/2013) and thus 
supportive of the results from study ARCHES. 
The overall safety profile of enzalutamide in the treatment of adult men with mHSPC is consistent with 
the already known safety profile of enzalutamide in other settings and no new unexpected findings have 
been identified.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The use of enzalutamide in combination with ADT has led to a substantial longer rPFS based on the 
results of study ARCHES. Even though there are uncertainties on the magnitude of the benefit in terms of 
OS, the results are considered clinically relevant. Overall, the risks associated with enzalutamide in this 
setting are considered manageable and in line with the already known safety profile of the drug. In view 
of the favourable effects, the benefit-risk balance is considered positive.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Xtandi in the treatment of adult men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate 
cancer (mHSPC) in combination with androgen deprivation therapy is positive.

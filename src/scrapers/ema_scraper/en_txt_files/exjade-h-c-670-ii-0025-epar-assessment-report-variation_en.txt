1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Type II variation 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Novartis Europharm Ltd 
submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 8 December 2011 an application for a variation 
including an extension of indication.  
This application concerns the following medicinal product: 
Medicinal product: 
International non-proprietary 
Presentations: 
Exjade 
name: 
DEFERASIROX 
The following variation was requested: 
Variation requested 
See Annex A 
Type 
C.I.6.a 
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new 
II 
therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one 
The MAH proposed a change of indication for the treatment of infrequently transfused beta-
thalassemia major patients in section 4.1. The MAH also proposed to update the product 
information in line with the latest QRD template (version 8, revision 1). 
The variation proposed amendments to the SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and Package Leaflet. 
Exajde was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/02/092 on 13 March 2002.  
The new indication, which is the subject of this application, falls within the above mentioned 
orphan designation. 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/216/2011 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/216/2011 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) 
No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for 
a condition related to the proposed indication. 
 Protocol assistance 
The MAH did not seek Protocol Assistance at the CHMP.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Beta thalassaemia (β-thalassaemia) major syndromes are associated with considerable morbidity 
and mortality, mostly as a result of iron overload of visceral organs due to repeated blood 
transfusions. Iron chelation therapy, aimed to remove the excess of iron administered in blood 
transfusions and to reduce the existing iron burden, represents the mainstay of the treatment of 
these patients.  
Deferoxamine is considered the the comparator reference iron chelation therapy. It is administered 
by subcutaneous infusion overnight 5 days a week. In consequence, it is associated with poor 
compliance.  
Exjade (deferasirox) is an orally available iron chelator for once daily use. Exjade is indicated for 
the treatment of chronic iron overload due to frequent blood transfusions (≥7 ml/kg/month of 
packed red blood cells) in patients with beta thalassaemia major aged 6 years and older. 
Exjade is also indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions when 
deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in the following patient groups: 
- 
- 
- 
in patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload due to frequent blood 
transfusions (≥7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) aged 2 to 5 years, 
in patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload due to infrequent blood 
transfusions (<7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) aged 2 years and older, 
in patients with other anaemias aged 2 years and older. 
In 2012, the indication of Exjade has also been extended for the treatment of chronic iron overload 
requiring chelation therapy when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in patients 
with non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes aged 10 years and older. 
The initial marketing authorisation of Exjade was granted on the basis of Study ICL670C0107. The 
approved indication was based on the results of a subgroup analysis within this trial. The restriction 
to use Exjade in infrequently transfused patients when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or 
inadequate resulted from a failure to establish non-inferiority in the subgroup of less severely iron 
overloaded patients. 
In this application, the MAH of Exjade proposed to change the indication by removing this 
restriction of indication “when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate”, thus 
proposing the use of deferasirox as first-line treatment in infrequently-transfused patients beta-
thalassemia major patients aged 6 years and older. This variation application was supported by an 
analysis of 2,102 β-thalassemia major patients exposed to deferasirox in 6 completed clinical trials.  
Further to the assessment of the CHMP and their conclusions as detailed in this report that this 
extension of the indication was not considered approvable, the MAH decided not to pursue the 
proposed change to the indication. 
However, the CHMP agreed to the proposal from the MAH to include in section 4.8 of the SmPC a 
description of the magnitude of the effect on estimated renal clearance based on the retrospective 
meta-analysis.

Given  the  difference  in  exposure  in  these  6  studies,  the  MAH  supported  this  application  with 
analyses performed separately as follows: 
-  Study  ICL670A2409,  consisting  of  1,115  β-thalassemia  patients  who  received  deferasirox 
(treatment duration of one year), 
-  Core  Study  ICL670A2402 and  its  extension  ICl670A2402E1  (combined  treatment  duration 
of up to 3 years), consisting of 237 β-thalassemia patients who received deferasirox, 
-  Pool  database  of  studies  ICL670A0105,  ICL670A0106,  ICL670A0107,  ICL670A0108  and 
their  extensions  (treatment  duration  of  up  to  5  years),  consisting  of  750  β-thalassemia 
patients who received deferasirox. 
During  the  evaluation,  the  MAH  also  provided  data  from  a  pooled  analysis  of  the  six  studies 
(“extended  pooled  safety  set”)  as  well  as  a  retrospective  analysis  of  the  data  obtained  in  the

Methods 
The table below summarises the study design characteristics of the 6 studies. 
Table 1 - Study design characteristics 
Study participants 
Study  ICL670A0105:  patients  (≥  18  years)  with  transfusion-dependent  iron  overload  (Liver  iron 
concentration (LIC): ≥ 5 to ≤ 15 mg Fe/g dw ) previously treated with deferoxamine. 
Study ICL670A0107: β-thalassemia patients (≥ 2 years) with transfusional haemosiderosis (LIC: ≥ 
2 mg Fe/g dw, transfusions ≥ 8 per year). 
Study  ICL670A0106:  paediatric  patients  (≥  2  to  ≤  17  years)  with  transfusion  dependent  β-
thalassaemia  major  (LIC:  ≥  2.5  mg  Fe/g  dw  or  SF  ≥  1000  μg/L)  previously  treated  with 
deferoxamine (for ≥ 4 weeks). 
Study ICL670A0108: Patients (≥ 2 years) with chronic anaemias and transfusional haemosiderosis 
unsuitable  for  treatment  with  deferoxamine.  In  this  analysis  only  patients  with  transfusional 
haemosiderosis due to β-thalassemia were included. 
-  Patients with β-thalassemia and documented non-compliance to deferoxamine were defined 
as having taken < 50% of the prescribed doses in the 12 months prior to study entry, with 
LIC ≥ 14 mg Fe/g dw. 
-  Patients  with  β-thalassaemia 
inadequately  chelated  with  deferoxamine  due 
to 
contraindications  and/or  due  to  documented  unacceptable  toxicity  of  deferoxamine,  or

documented  poor  response  to  deferoxamine  despite  proper  compliance,  with  LIC  ≥  2  mg 
Fe/g dw. 
Study  ICL670A2402:  patients  (≥  2  years)  with  transfusional  haemosiderosis who  were  previously 
treated with deferiprone or deferoxamine. The patients in the study were:  
-  β-thalassaemia  outpatients  with  transfusional  haemosiderosis  and  unable  to  be  chelated 
with deferoxamine due to deferoxamine being contra-indicated and/or due to documented 
unacceptable  toxicity  of  deferoxamine  or  documented  poor  response  to  deferoxamine 
despite proper compliance, with SF ≥ 500 μg/L and LIC ≥ 2 mg/Fe/g dw liver. 
-  β-thalassaemia  outpatients  with 
transfusional  haemosiderosis  and  documented 
noncompliance to deferoxamine, defined as having  taken less than 50% of the prescribed 
chelation therapy doses in the 12 months prior to study entry 
-  β-thalassemia outpatients with transfusional haemosiderosis treated with deferiprone, who 
discontinued deferiprone treatment at least 28 days before Day 1 of this study, and had SF 
≥ 500 μg/L and LIC ≥ 2 mg/Fe/g dw. 
Study ICL670A2409: patients (≥ 2 years) with transfusion-dependent iron overload who had been 
previously treated with chelation therapy as well as patients who had not. The patients  presented 
with  iron  overload  as  shown  by  SF  ≥  1000  μg/L  at  start  of  study  or  patients  presenting  with  SF 
<1000  μg/L  but  with  history  of  multiple  transfusions  (>  20  transfusions  or  100  mL/kg  of  packed 
red blood cells [pRBC]) and LIC >2 mg Fe/g dw (as confirmed by R2-MRI). 
Treatments 
•  Controlled studies 
Study  ICL670A0105:  randomisation  1:1:1  to  oral  deferasirox  10mg/kg/day,  oral  deferasirox 
20mg/kg/day  or  subcutaneous  infusions  of  deferoxamine  20  mg/kg/day  for  5  consecutive  days  a 
week. Subsequent dose-titrations were based on change in LIC, determined every 3 months by a 
non-invasive method (SQUID) over 12 months. 
Intermediate  extension  phase  (ICL670A0105E1):  after  completing  12  months  of  treatment 
consenting  patients  who  were  considered  to  be  deriving  benefit  from  treatment,  continued  to 
receive study therapy 
Non comparative long term extension (ICL670A0105E2): patients who completed the intermediate 
extension phase were eligible to receive deferasirox treatment for 5 years. 
Study  ICL670A0107:  Patients  were  randomised  (1:1)  to  once-daily  oral  doses  of  deferasirox  5  to 
40 mg/kg/day for 7 days/week or subcutaneous infusions of deferoxamine 20 to 60 mg/kg/day for 
5  consecutive  days/week.  After  randomisation  to  deferasirox  or  deferoxamine  patients  were 
assigned  to  different dose  cohorts  (5,  10,  20 or  30 mg/kg)  by  the  Investigator  according  to  their 
baseline LIC values, with doses fixed during the first year and subsequent dose titration based on 
safety and efficacy. 
Extension  study  (ICL670A0107E1)  enrolled  patients  who  had  completed  the  core  study,  and  was 
designed  primarily  to  evaluate  the  long  term  efficacy  and  safety  of  deferasirox  in  β-  thalassemia 
patients with transfusional haemosiderosis treated for 4 years. In the extension study, all patients 
received treatment with deferasirox, regardless of their treatment assignment in the core study.

•  Uncontrolled studies  
Study ICL670A0106: patients were treated with repeated doses of deferasirox 10 mg/kg/day with 
subsequent  dose  titration  based  on  change  in  LIC.  SQUID  was  performed  4  weeks  after  start  of 
treatment, and then every 12 weeks up to 48 weeks. 
Patients  who  had  completed  1-year  of  study  treatment  and  scheduled  assessments  in  the  core 
study were enrolled into the extension phase ICL670A0106E1, to evaluate the long term safety of 
deferasirox in paediatric patients with β-thalassemia treated for 5 years 
Study  ICL670A0108:  Once  daily  oral  doses  of  deferasirox  between  5  to  40  mg/kg  based  on  their 
baseline LIC for one year and subsequent dose-titration was based on safety and efficacy. Patients 
with  LIC  of  2  to  3  mg  Fe/g  dw  received  deferasirox  5  mg/kg,  with  LIC  of  >  3  to  7  mg  Fe/g  dw 
received 10 mg/kg, with LIC of > 7 to 14 mg Fe/g dw received 20 mg/kg, and with LIC of > 14 mg 
Fe/g dw received 30 mg/kg. 
Patients who completed at least one year of treatment in the core phase were enrolled in to the 4-
year extension phase (ICL670A0108E), to evaluate the long term safety and tolerability profile of 
deferasirox. 
Study ICL670A2402: Fixed starting once-daily dose of 10 or 20 mg/kg/day based on baseline LIC, 
with subsequent dose adjustments based on SF levels. 
Patients who completed at least one year of treatment in the core phase were enrolled into the 2-
year extension phase (ICL670A2402E1), to evaluate the long term safety and tolerability profile of 
deferasirox. 
Study ICL670A2409: initial recommended daily dose of deferasirox was 20 mg/kg/day body weight 
for patients who had received blood transfusions with a frequency of about 2  to 4 units/month of 
pRBC  (7to  14  mL  pRBCs/kg/month).  An  initial  daily  dose  of  30  mg/kg/day  was  considered  for 
patients  receiving  more  frequent  blood  transfusions  and  10  mg/kg/day  for  patients  receiving  less 
frequent  transfusions  or  for  patients  receiving  exchange  transfusions.  Subsequent  doses  were 
titrated based on the combined evaluation of efficacy and safety parameters. 
Objectives 
Key objectives are described in Table 1. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Key endpoints are described in Table 1. Blood intake was expressed as pRBC volume per kilogram 
body weight per month (mL/kg/month) and the blood intake groups (blood intake derived from one 
year  of  treatment)  were  categorised  following  the  definition  used  in  the  current  SPC  for 
deferasirox:  
- 
Infrequently transfused patients: < 7 mL pRBCs/kg/month 
-  Frequently transfused patients: 7 to 14 and > 14 mL pRBCs/kg/month 
-  The formula used to calculate the average blood intake in mL/kg/month was: (total sum of 
blood transfused by weight) / (corrected transfusion exposure / month), where: 
-  Total  sum  of  blood  transfused  by  weight  (mL/kg)  is  the  sum  of  [(amount  of  blood 
transfused  [mL])  ×  haematocrit  (%)  /  100]  /  (body  weight  (kg)  at  transfusion).  If  the 
transfusion  record’s  haematocrit  value  was  missing,  it  was  imputed  by  the  haematocrit 
value  provided  by  the  respective  centre.  If  the  amount  of  blood  transfused  was  not

expressed in mL (or cm3), it was first converted to mL. For units expressed in ‘pack’, ‘unit’ 
or ‘bag’, it was assumed that one pack/unit/bag was 200 mg iron, i.e. 185 mL of RBC. 
-  Corrected transfusion exposure was the normal exposure plus a correction factor, i.e. (last 
transfusion  date  −  first  transfusion  date  +  1)  +  ([last  transfusion  date  −  first  transfusion 
date + 1] / [number of transfusion records − 1]). 
The efficacy of deferasirox was also assessed by groups of age at first dose (2 to <6, 6 to <12, 12 
to <18, and ≥ 18 years) and average dose (<7.5, 7.5 to 12.5, >12.5 to 17.5, >17.5 to <25, 25 to 
<35,  and  ≥  35  mg/kg/day).  These  dose  groups  correspond  to  deferasirox  doses  used  in  clinical 
practice (5, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 40 mg/kg/day, respectively). 
The efficacy characterization was based on changes after 1 year of treatment with deferasirox in:  
-  Serum Ferritin (SF)  
- 
- 
Iron Excretion (IE) 
Liver Iron Concentration (LIC) 
In addition, long term efficacy, up to 5 years of treatment, was assessed. In order to account for 
the exposure differences across the 3 datasets, data were provided by yearly periods of treatment 
(a year was defined as 365 days). 
Sample size 
Not applicable. 
Randomisation 
In studies ICL670A0105 and ICL670A0105, patients were randomised to oral deferasirox or 
subcutaneous infusion of deferoxamine. ICL670A0105 was a three arm study, as two doses of 
deferasirox (10 or 20 mg/kg/day) were tested, while in ICL670A0107 a range of dose (5-40 
mg/kg/day) was allowed in the deferasirox arm. 
Blinding (masking) 
Not applicable. 
Statistical methods 
The efficacy parameters were analysed using the following analysis sets: 
-  Safety  Analysis  Set  (SAS)  comprised  all  patients  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of 
deferasirox and had at least one post-baseline safety assessment. 
-  Full  Analysis  Set  (FAS)  comprised  all  patients  who  successfully  passed  screening  and  had 
been selected to start study medication in the context of the respective protocol. 
The  FAS,  which  required  that  patients  be  randomised  or  assigned  to  a  treatment,  but  not 
necessarily  treated,  was  used  for  studies  ICL670A2409  and  ICL670A2402.  For  the  Pool,  the  SAS 
was used; this database had been previously created to perform safety analysis of deferasirox and 
all patients included were treated with deferasirox. Thus, efficacy and safety analyses in this report 
are based on the SAS for the Pool dataset.

Ancillary analyses 
Comparisons of efficacy and safety between DFX and DFO by blood intake categories were performed 
within  study  A0107.  In  this  study,  infrequently  transfused  patients  were  comparable  to  frequently 
transfused  patients  in  terms  of  age  and  race.  The  proportion  of  female  patients  and  the  baseline  SF 
values tended to be higher in infrequently transfused patients. Results are summarised in Table 10 and 
Figures 5-6.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  aim  of  this  application  was  to  demonstrate  efficacy  (and  safety)  of  deferasirox  in  infrequently 
transfused  beta-thalassemia  patients  in  first  line  therapy.  To  do  so,  the  MAH  did  not  conduct  a  new 
randomised study to compare deferasirox with the standard of care deferoxamine in the infrequently-
Assessment report  
Exjade II/25 
EMA/CHMP/353279/2013  
Page 20/33 
 
 
 
 
 
transfused  population.  The  MAH  supported  this  objective  by  comparing  the  activity  of  deferasirox 
between infrequently-transfused and frequently-transfused patients.  
The MAH presented a descriptive analysis of pooled individual data from 6 deferasirox studies (phase II 
to phase IV) without an active comparator. This descriptive analysis was performed by subgroup.  
Studies  were  heterogeneous,  especially  in  terms  of  intervention  and  consequently  results  were 
presented separately in 3 main datasets. However, presentation in three separate datasets in order to 
account for the heterogeneity was considered insufficient. 
Specification of starting dose based on transfusion requirements was implemented only after the first 
studies. Furthermore, schedule of dose titration was different across studies, whereby deferasirox dose 
was maintained constant for the first year of treatment in some studies, whereas in other studies dose-
titration  was  possible,  based  on  efficacy  markers.  Additionally,  dose  titration  (during  the  first  year  of 
treatment  and  after)  was  not  standardised  across  the  trials.  These  discrepancies  may  affect  the 
comparability  of  the  intervention  among  the  samples  and  consequently  affect  robustness  of  efficacy 
conclusions that might be drawn from the datasets. 
The  additional  pooled  analysis  of  the  six  studies  provided  by  the  MAH  presented  several  major 
methodological  weaknesses  which  impacted  the  reliability  of  its  results  (clinical  heterogeneity  of  the 
studies, retrospective categorisation of the patients with potential biases in this allocation and potential 
non comparability of the groups).  
Similarly, the retrospective analysis of the data obtained in the pivotal study A 0107 presented several 
major methodological weaknesses (retrospective allocation of the patients in subgroups, no statistical 
testing  strategy,  small  sample  size  of  the  subgroups  especially  for  infrequently  transfused  patients) 
and therefore cannot be considered as a reliable comparison of the efficacy of DFX versus DFO. 
Contradictory  results  were  observed  in  the  different  datasets,  which  could  be  related  to  the  different 
criteria to modify the dose (LIC or serum ferritin variations) in each single study and further underlines 
the  heterogeneity  of  the  examined  trials  and  the  difficulty  to  draw  any  incontrovertible  conclusion  of 
efficacy. Consequently, the Pool overall change is hardly interpretable.  
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The submitted analyses do not provide sufficient level of evidence to establish that the clinical efficacy 
of deferasirox in infrequently transfused patients with β-thalassemia major is non-inferior to 
deferoxamine.  
Further to the assessment of the CHMP and their conclusions as detailed in this report that this 
extension of the indication was not considered approvable, the MAH decided not to pursue with the 
proposed change to the indication.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
The  safety  evaluation  was  based  on  analysis  of  2,102  β-thalassaemia  major  patients  exposed  to 
deferasirox  (mean  daily  dose  22.4-25.7  mg/kg/day)  in  6  completed  trials.  Five  of  these  studies 
consisted of a core phase and an extension phase (with treatment durations of up to 5 years) aimed to 
assess long term safety. Two of these studies involved the use of the active comparator deferoxamine 
as  a  control.  This  analysis  allowed  a  quantitative  characterisation  of  the  safety  of  deferasirox  in 
patients  with  infrequent  blood  transfusions  (<7  mL  pRBCs/kg/month)  in  comparison  with  frequently 
transfused patients (≥ 7 mL pRBCs/kg/month). 
The safety population comprised all patients from the 6 clinical studies who received at least one dose 
of study drug and had at least one post-baseline safety assessment. 
Due to the differences in exposure in the 6 studies included in this analysis, the studies were grouped 
into 3 datasets: 
-  Study ICL670A2409 (treatment duration of one year) 
-  Pooled database consisting of studies ICL670A0105, ICL670A0106, ICL670A0107, 
ICL670A0108 and their extensions (treatment duration up to 5 years) 
-  Study ICL670A2402/E consisting of the core study and its extension ICl670A2402E (treatment 
duration up to 3 years) 
Since the key objective of the safety analysis was to compare the safety of deferasirox by blood intake, 
patients were categorised into 3 blood intake groups as follows: 
- 
Infrequently transfused patients: <7 mL pRBCs/kg/month 
-  Frequently transfused patients: 7-14 mL pRBCs/kg/month and >14 mL pRBCs/kg/month 
The safety of deferasirox was also assessed by age at first dose and dose. 
Patient exposure 
This analysis includes exposure of 4,326 patient-years (528 patient-years of exposure for infrequently 
transfused  patients  and  3,785  patient-years  of  exposure  for  patients  receiving  more  frequent 
transfusions) including 2,433 patients-years of exposure in paediatric patients. 
Globally,  patients  in  Study  ICL670A2402  were  younger  compared  to  patients  in  Study  ICL670A2409 
and in the Pool (median age of 12, 17 and 18 years, respectively). Overall, approximately 45% of the 
patients  were  ≥  18  years old  (adults),  24%  were  12  to  <18  years  old  (adolescents),  20%  were  6  to 
<12 years old (older children), and 10% were <6 years old (young children).

Across the 3 datasets, patients in the low blood intake category were older (median age: 21, 22, and 
20 years in Study ICL670A2409, the Pool, and Study ICL670A2402, respectively) compared to patients 
with moderate (median age: 15, 18, and 12 years, respectively) and high blood intake (median age: 
15, 11, and 8 years, respectively).

According to the MAH, in the Pool in years 2 to 5 and in Study ICL670A2402/E in years 2 and 3, the 
overall  AE  incidence  and  the  incidence  of  most  individuals  PTs  in  infrequently  transfused  patients 
tended  to  be  slightly  lower  than  in  the  overall  patient  population.  However,  the  number  of  AEs  for 
individual PTs in infrequently transfused patients was too small to make firm conclusions.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
•  Deaths 
A total of 16 deaths on study or  within 28 days of  study drug discontinuation were reported in the 3 
datasets and have previously been reported in the individual study reports.  
None of the deaths were suspected to be related to deferasirox treatment. Two deaths occurred in 307 
infrequently transfused patients (0.64%) and 14 deaths occurred in 1758 patients (0.79%) who were 
more frequently transfused. 
•  Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)

•  AEs of special interest 
Group  term  AEs  for  rash,  nausea/vomiting,  abdominal  pain,  and  diarrhoea  were  the  most  frequently 
reported in all datasets. Most of these AEs were mild to moderate in severity, rarely reported as SAEs, 
and infrequently resulted in study drug discontinuation. 
No clear pattern in the frequencies of AEs of special interest by blood intake groups could be delineated 
across  the  3  datasets.  In  the  2409  and  2402/E  datasets,  rash  was  more  frequently  reported  in 
frequently transfused patients. However, in the Pool dataset, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and abnormal

blood  creatinine  were  more  commonly  reported  in  infrequently  transfused  patients.  No  cases  of 
Fanconi  syndrome  or  hearing  loss  were  reported  in  infrequently  transfused  patients.  Across  all  3 
datasets,  only  one  patient,  in  the  moderate  blood  intake  category,  presented  with  a  liver  function 
impairment group term AE. All other AEs of special interest were of similar frequencies by blood intake 
groups. 
Table  16  –  Adverse  event  of  special  interest  by  blood  intake  and  PT  in  the  first  year  of 
treatment (SAS) 
In  subsequent  years  of  treatment,  diarrhoea  and  abnormal  blood  creatinine  were  more  common  in 
frequently  transfused  patients  than  in  those  infrequently  transfused  in  Years  2  to  4,  with  similar 
frequencies for these AESIs between blood intake groups in Year 5. Abdominal pain was more common 
in frequently transfused patients than in infrequently transfused patients in Year 2; however, this trend 
was  reversed  in  Year  3,  with  a  similar  frequency  of  this  AE  of  special  interest  between  both  blood 
intake groups in Years 4 and Year 5. All other AEs of special interest were similar in incidence between 
blood intake groups throughout all time points.

Post-marketing experience 
Deferasirox is commercially available within the United States, European Union, Switzerland, and other 
markets worldwide for the treatment of transfusional iron overload. 
Safety  data  from  all  sources  (literature,  studies,  spontaneous  reporting)  are  reviewed  on  an  ongoing 
basis for any impact on the EU SPC and local labelling.  
The total cumulative patient exposure since the International Birth Date of 02-Nov-2005 up to 31-Oct-
2010  was  89,168  patient-treatment-years.  The  total  cumulative  exposure  in  MAH  sponsored 
investigational  clinical  trials  (excluding  PMS  studies,  third  party  study  studies  and  registries)  as  of 
31-Oct-2010 was 6,922 patients.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
As discussed with respect to efficacy results, the studies included in these analyses are heterogeneous. 
The proposed meta-analysis compared 2 populations with very different size which is a limitation of the 
proposed approach especially for safety. Infrequently transfused patients constitute a relatively small 
fraction of the subjects (15%). Data available for infrequently transfused paediatric patients was also 
too scarce to draw any firm conclusion on the safety in this subpopulation. 
Therefore, due to heterogeneity of studies, results of this meta-analysis should be taken with caution 
and no firm conclusions can be drawn, particularly when looking at the data in subgroups by age.  
Concerning the currently approved restricted indication, overall no new signal emerged from these 
studies. The overall adverse event profile was consistent with the known safety profile of Exjade and 
complications of underlying conditions. Despite the methodological pitfalls, the meta-analysis provided 
the best available estimate of the effect of Exjade on creatinine clearance relevant for the currently 
approved restricted indication. As this has been previously missing from the SmPC, a description of the 
magnitude of the effect on estimated renal clearance has been included in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety data available based on the retrospective meta-analysis for infrequently transfused patients 
are not sufficient to draw any firm conclusion on the safety of deferasirox outside the currently 
approved restricted indication (“when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate”). Further 
to the assessment of the CHMP and their conclusions as detailed in this report that this extension of 
the indication was not considered approvable, the MAH decided not to pursue with the proposed 
change to the indication. 
Concerning the currently approved restricted indication, the CHMP included a description of the 
magnitude of the effect on estimated renal clearance in section 4.8 of the SmPC based on the 
retrospective meta-analysis. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The Annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged.  
2.6.  Risk management plan 
No updates to the current version of the risk management plan are necessary. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information   
Further to data submitted in this application, the following information was added to the summary of 
the safety profile in section 4.8 of the SmPC:  
 “In a retrospective meta-analysis of 2,102 adult and paediatric beta-thalassaemia patients with 
transfusional iron overload (including patients with different characteristics such as transfusion 
intensity, posology and treatment duration) treated in two randomised clinical trials and four open 
label studies of up to five years’ duration, a mean creatinine clearance decrease of 13.2% in adult 
patients (95%CI: -14.4% to -12.1%; n=935) and 9.9% (95%CI: -11.1% to -8.6%; n=1142) in 
paediatric patients was observed during the first year of treatment. In a subset of patients followed for 
more than one year (n=250 up to five years), no further decrease in mean creatinine clearance levels 
was observed in subsequent years.”

Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template (version 
8.3), which were reviewed and accepted by the CHMP. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Exjade is an efficient oral iron chelator. An iron chelating agent permits to achieve safe levels of body 
iron. This is a slow process because only a small proportion of body iron is available for chelation at 
any moment.  
The purpose of this submission was the extension of indication of deferasirox to first line use in 
infrequently transfused beta-thalassemia patients aged 6 years or older. Current standard therapy in 
this indication is subcutaneous deferoxamine. 
The MAH submitted pooled analysis of six studies in infrequently transfused patients as well as a 
retrospective analysis of the data obtained in the pivotal study A 0107 providing comparative results of 
DFX versus DFO in order to demonstrate efficacy and safety of deferasirox in this population. Efficacy 
was assessed by mean changes in serum ferritin levels, liver iron concentration (LIC) and iron 
excretion (IE). Overall, the data submitted had many limitations and no conclusions could be drawn 
based on these results. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The benefits of deferasirox as first-line treatment in infrequently-transfused patients beta outside the 
currently approved restricted indication (“when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or 
inadequate”) have not been established. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
No new signal emerged from these analyses: The overall adverse event profile was consistent with the 
known safety profile of Exjade and complications of underlying conditions.  
Nephrotoxicity is a known safety concern with Exjade. The main related event observed more 
frequently in infrequently transfused patient was blood creatinine increased in the 1st year of 
treatment in 2 datasets. In a subset of patients followed for more than one year (n=250 up to five 
years), no further decrease in mean creatinine clearance levels was observed in subsequent years.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The data available for infrequently transfused paediatric were insufficient to draw any firm conclusion 
on the safety of deferasirox as first-line treatment in infrequently-transfused patients beta outside the 
currently approved restricted indication (“when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or 
inadequate”).

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects and benefit-risk balance 
Non-comparative results from the pooled analysis are difficult to interpret and are not sufficiently 
robust to draw conclusions. Retrospective analysis from the study A0107 also presented major 
methodological weaknesses which cannot allow to conclude on the efficacy profile of deferasirox versus 
deferoxamine in infrequently-transfused patients. 
No new signal emerged from these analyses. However, in view of the lack of representativeness of the 
dataset, adverse events of interest and safety concern may not have occurred or be underestimated in 
the proposed analysis particularly the know concern of nephrotoxicity which requires close monitoring. 
In the absence of established favourable and unfavourable effects, the benefit-risk balance of 
deferasirox as first-line treatment in infrequently-transfused patients beta outside the currently 
approved restricted indication (“when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate”) cannot 
be considered as positive. 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
The CHMP agreed to include in section 4.8 of the SmPC a description of the magnitude of the effect on 
estimated renal clearance based on the retrospective meta-analysis. 
4.  Recommendations 
Further to the assessment of the CHMP and their conclusions as detailed in this report that this 
extension of the indication was not considered approvable, the MAH decided not to pursue with the 
proposed change to the indication. 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following changes: 
Variation requested 
Type 
C.I.6.a 
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new 
II 
therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one 
Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC to include a description of the magnitude of the effect on estimated 
renal clearance based on a retrospective meta-analysis of 2,102 beta-thalassemia major patients 
exposed to deferasirox in 6 completed clinical trials. The Marketing Authorisation Holder also took the 
opportunity to update the product information with version 8.3 of the QRD template. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the SmPC and Annex II. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/216/2011 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary 
of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Rybrevant as monotherapy is indicated for treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) Exon 20 insertion 
mutations, after failure of platinum-based therapy.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Rybrevant should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of 
anticancer medicinal products.
Rybrevant should be administered by a healthcare professional with access to appropriate medical 
support to manage infusion-related reactions (IRRs) if they occur.
Before initiation of Rybrevant therapy, EGFR Exon 20 insertion mutation-positive status must be 
established using a validated test method (see section 5.1).
Posology
Premedications should be administered to reduce the risk of IRRs with Rybrevant (see below “Dose 
modifications” and “Recommended concomitant medicinal products”).
The recommended dose of Rybrevant is provided in Table 1, and the dosing schedule is provided in 
Table 2 (see below “Infusion rates”).

Infusion-related reactions
Infusion should be interrupted at the first sign of IRRs. Additional supportive medicinal products (e.g., 
additional glucocorticoids, antihistamine, antipyretics and antiemetics) should be administered as 
clinically indicated (see section 4.4).

Grade 1-3 (mild-severe): Upon recovery of symptoms, resume infusion at 50% of the previous 
rate. If there are no additional symptoms, the rate may be increased per the recommended 
infusion rate (see Table 5). Concomitant medicinal products should be administered at the next 
dose (see Table 4).
Recurrent Grade 3 or Grade 4 (life-threatening): Permanently discontinue Rybrevant.

Skin and nail reactions
If the patient develops a Grade 2 skin or nail reaction, supportive care should be initiated; if there is no 
improvement after 2 weeks, dose reduction should be considered (see Table 3). If the patient develops 
a Grade 3 skin or nail reaction, supportive care should be initiated, and interruption of Rybrevant
should be considered until the adverse reaction improves. Upon recovery of the skin or nail reaction to 
≤ Grade 2, Rybrevant should be resumed at a reduced dose. If the patient develops Grade 4 skin 
reactions, permanently discontinue Rybrevant (see section 4.4).
3
Interstitial lung disease
Rybrevant should be withheld if interstitial lung disease (ILD) or ILD-like adverse reactions 
(pneumonitis) is suspected. If the patient is confirmed to have ILD or ILD-like adverse reactions (e.g., 
pneumonitis), permanently discontinue Rybrevant (see section 4.4).
Recommended concomitant medicinal products
Prior to infusion (Week 1, Days 1 and 2), antihistamines, antipyretics, and glucocorticoids should be 
administered to reduce the risk of IRRs (see Table 4). For subsequent doses, antihistamines and 
antipyretics are required to be administered. Antiemetics should be administered as needed.

Special populations
Paediatric population
There is no relevant use of amivantamab in the paediatric population in the treatment of non-small cell 
lung cancer.
Elderly
No dose adjustments are necessary (see section 4.8, section 5.1, and section 5.2).
Renal impairment
No formal studies of amivantamab in patients with renal impairment have been conducted. Based on 
population pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses, no dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or 
moderate renal impairment. Caution is required in patients with severe renal impairment as 
amivantamab has not been studied in this patient population (see section 5.2). If treatment is started, 
patients should be monitored for adverse reactions with dose modifications per the recommendations 
above.
Hepatic impairment
No formal studies of amivantamab in patients with hepatic impairment have been conducted. Based on 
population PK analyses, no dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment.
Caution is required in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment as amivantamab has not 
been studied in this patient population (see section 5.2). If treatment is started, patients should be 
monitored for adverse reactions with dose modifications per the recommendations above.
Method of administration
Rybrevant is for intravenous use. It is administered as an intravenous infusion following dilution with 
sterile 5% glucose solution or sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. Rybrevant must 
be administered with in-line filtration.
For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.
4
Infusion rates
Following dilution, the infusion should be administered intravenously at the infusion rates presented in 
Table 5 below. Due to the frequency of IRRs at the first dose, amivantamab should be infused via a 
peripheral vein at Week 1 and Week 2; infusion via a central line may be administered for subsequent 
weeks when the risk of IRR is lower (see section 6.6). It is recommended for the first dose to be 
prepared as close to administration as possible to maximise the likelihood of completing the infusion 
in the event of an IRR.

4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Infusion-related reactions
Infusion-related reactions commonly occurred in patients treated with amivantamab (see section 4.8).
Prior to initial infusion (Week 1), antihistamines, antipyretics, and glucocorticoids should be 
administered to reduce the risk of IRRs. For subsequent doses, antihistamines and antipyretics should 
be administered. The initial infusion should be administered in split doses on Week 1, Day 1 and 2.
Patients should be treated in a setting with appropriate medical support to treat IRRs. Infusions should 
be interrupted at the first sign of IRRs of any severity and post-infusion medicinal products should be 
administered as clinically indicated. Upon resolution of symptoms, the infusion should be resumed at
50% of the previous rate. For recurrent Grade 3 or Grade 4 IRRs, Rybrevant should be permanently 
discontinued (see section 4.2).
Interstitial lung disease
Interstitial lung disease (ILD) or ILD-like adverse reactions (e.g., pneumonitis) have been reported in 
patients treated with amivantamab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for symptoms 
indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g., dyspnoea, cough, fever). If symptoms develop, treatment with 
Rybrevant should be interrupted pending investigation of these symptoms. Suspected ILD or ILD-like 
5
adverse reactions should be evaluated and appropriate treatment should be initiated as necessary. 
Rybrevant should be permanently discontinued in patients with confirmed ILD or ILD-like adverse 
reactions (see section 4.2).
Skin and nail reactions
Rash (including dermatitis acneiform), pruritus and dry skin occurred in patients treated with 
amivantamab (see section 4.8). Patients should be instructed to limit sun exposure during and for 
2 months after Rybrevant therapy. Protective clothing and use of broad-spectrum UVA/UVB 
sunscreen are advisable. Alcohol-free emollient cream is recommended for dry areas. If skin reactions 
develop, topical corticosteroids and topical and/or oral antibiotics should be administered. For Grade 3 
or poorly-tolerated Grade 2 events, systemic antibiotics and oral steroids should also be administered. 
Patients presenting with severe rash that has an atypical appearance or distribution or lack
improvement within 2 weeks should be referred promptly to a dermatologist. Rybrevant should be
dose reduced, interrupted, or permanently discontinued based on severity (see section 4.2).
Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) has been reported. Treatment with this medicinal product should be 
discontinued if TEN is confirmed.
Eye disorders
Eye disorders, including keratitis, occurred in patients treated with amivantamab (see section 4.8). 
Patients presenting with worsening eye symptoms should promptly be referred to an ophthalmologist 
and should discontinue use of contact lenses until symptoms are evaluated. For dose modifications for 
Grade 3 or 4 eye disorders, see section 4.2.
Sodium content
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially 
“sodium-free”. This medicinal product may be diluted in sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution 
for infusion. This should be taken into consideration for patients on a controlled sodium diet (see 
section 6.6).
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No drug interaction studies have been performed. As an IgG1 monoclonal antibody, renal excretion 
and hepatic enzyme-mediated metabolism of intact amivantamab are unlikely to be major elimination 
routes. As such, variations in drug-metabolising enzymes are not expected to affect the elimination of 
amivantamab. Due to the high affinity to a unique epitope on EGFR and MET, amivantamab is not 
anticipated to alter drug-metabolising enzymes.
Vaccines
No clinical data are available on the efficacy and safety of vaccinations in patients taking
amivantamab. Avoid the use of live or live-attenuated vaccines while patients are taking amivantamab.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Women of child-bearing potential/Contraception
Women of child-bearing potential should use effective contraception during and for 3 months after 
cessation of amivantamab treatment.
Pregnancy
There are no human data to assess the risk of amivantamab use during pregnancy. No animal 
reproductive studies were conducted to inform a drug-associated risk. Administration of EGFR and 
MET inhibitor molecules in pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of impairment of 
embryo-foetal development, embryo lethality, and abortion. Therefore, based on its mechanism of 
action and findings in animal models, amivantamab could cause foetal harm when administered to a 
pregnant woman. Amivantamab should not be given during pregnancy unless the benefit of treatment 
of the woman is considered to outweigh potential risks to the foetus. If the patient becomes pregnant 
6
while taking this medicinal product the patient should be informed of the potential risk to the foetus
(see section 5.3).
Breast-feeding
It is unknown whether amivantamab is excreted in human milk. Human IgGs are known to be excreted 
in breast milk during the first few days after birth, which is decreasing to low concentrations soon 
afterwards. A risk to the breast-fed child cannot be excluded during this short period just after birth, 
although IgGs are likely to be degraded in the gastrointestinal tract of the breast-fed child and not 
absorbed. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain 
from amivantamab therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the 
benefit of therapy for the woman.
Fertility
There are no data on the effect of amivantamab on human fertility. Effects on male and female fertility 
have not been evaluated in animal studies.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Rybrevant may have moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Please see 
section 4.8 (e.g., dizziness, fatigue, visual impairment). If patients experience treatment-related 
symptoms, including vision-related adverse reactions, affecting their ability to concentrate and react, it 
is recommended that they do not drive or use machines until the effect subsides.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The most frequent adverse reactions in all grades were rash (76%), infusion-related reactions (67%), 
nail toxicity (47%), hypoalbuminaemia (31%), oedema (26%), fatigue (26%), stomatitis (24%),
nausea (23%), and constipation (23%). Serious adverse reactions included ILD (1.3%), IRR (1.1%), 
and rash (1.1%). Three percent of patients discontinued Rybrevant due to adverse reactions. The most 
frequent adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation were IRR (1.1%), ILD (0.5%), and nail 
toxicity (0.5%).
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
Table 6 summarises the adverse drug reactions that occurred in patients receiving amivantamab.
The data reflects exposure to amivantamab in 380 patients with locally advanced or metastatic
non-small cell lung cancer after failure of platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients received 
amivantamab 1,050 mg (for patients < 80 kg) or 1,400 mg (for patients ≥ 80 kg). The median exposure 
to amivantamab was 4.1 months (range: 0.0 to 39.7 months).
Adverse reactions observed during clinical studies are listed below by frequency category. Frequency 
categories are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon 
(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); and not known 
(frequency cannot be estimated from the available data).
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing 
seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions
Infusion-related reactions
Infusion-related reactions occurred in 67% of patients treated with amivantamab. Ninety-eight percent 
of IRRs were Grade 1-2. Ninety-nine percent of IRRs occurred at the first infusion with a median time 
to onset of 60 minutes, and the majority occurring within 2 hours of infusion start. The most frequent 
signs and symptoms include chills, dyspnoea, nausea, flushing, chest discomfort, and vomiting (see 
section 4.4).
Interstitial lung disease
Interstitial lung disease or ILD-like adverse reactions have been reported with the use of amivantamab
as well as with other EGFR inhibitors. Interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis was reported in 2.6% of
patients. Patients with a medical history of ILD, drug-induced ILD, radiation pneumonitis that 
required steroid treatment, or any evidence of clinically active ILD were excluded from the clinical 
study (see section 4.4).
Skin and nail reactions
Rash (including dermatitis acneiform), pruritus, and dry skin occurred in 76% of patients treated with 
amivantamab. Most cases were Grade 1 or 2, with Grade 3 rash events occurring in 3% of patients. 
Rash leading to amivantamab discontinuation occurred in 0.3% of patients. Rash usually developed 
within the first 4 weeks of therapy, with a median time to onset of 14 days. Nail toxicity occurred in 
patients treated with amivantamab. Most events were Grade 1 or 2, with Grade 3 nail toxicity
occurring in 1.8% of patients (see section 4.4).
Eye disorders
Eye disorders, including keratitis (0.5%), occurred in 9% of patients treated with amivantamab. Other 
reported adverse reactions included growth of eyelashes, visual impairment, and other eye disorders.
All events were Grade 1-2 (see section 4.4).
Other special populations
Elderly
There are limited clinical data with amivantamab in patients 75 years of age or over (see section 5.1). 
No overall differences in safety were observed between patients ≥ 65 years of age and patients 
< 65 years of age.
Immunogenicity
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is the potential for immunogenicity. In a clinical study of 
patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC treated with amivantamab, 3 (0.9%) of the 
347 evaluable patients tested positive for anti-amivantamab antibodies. There was no evidence of an 
altered pharmacokinetic, efficacy, or safety profile due to anti-amivantamab antibodies.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
No maximum tolerated dose has been determined in a clinical study in which patients received up to 
1,750 mg administered intravenously. There is no known specific antidote for amivantamab overdose. 
In the event of an overdose, treatment with Rybrevant should be stopped, the patient should be 
monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse events and appropriate general supportive measures 
should be instituted immediately until clinical toxicity has diminished or resolved.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Monoclonal antibodies and antibody drug conjugates, ATC code: 
L01FX18.
Mechanism of action
Amivantamab is a low-fucose, fully-human IgG1-based EGFR-MET bispecific antibody with immune 
cell-directing activity that targets tumours with activating EGFR Exon 20 insertion mutations. 
Amivantamab binds to the extracellular domains of EGFR and MET.
Amivantamab disrupts EGFR and MET signalling functions through blocking ligand binding and 
enhancing degradation of EGFR and MET, thereby preventing tumour growth and progression. The 
presence of EGFR and MET on the surface of tumour cells also allows for targeting of these cells for 
destruction by immune effector cells, such as natural killer cells and macrophages, through 
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and trogocytosis mechanisms, respectively.
Pharmacodynamic effects
Albumin
Amivantamab decreased serum albumin concentration, a pharmacodynamic effect of MET inhibition, 
typically during the first 8 weeks (see section 4.8); thereafter, albumin concentration stabilised for the 
remainder of amivantamab treatment.
Clinical efficacy and safety
CHRYSALIS is a multicentre, open-label, multi-cohort study conducted to assess the safety and 
efficacy of Rybrevant in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Efficacy was evaluated 
in 114 patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who had EGFR Exon 20 insertion 
mutations, whose disease had progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy, and who had a 
median follow-up of 12.5 months. Tumour tissue (93%) and/or plasma (10%) samples for all patients 
were tested locally to determine EGFR Exon 20 insertion mutation status using next generation 
sequencing (NGS) in 46% of patients and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 41% of patients; for
4% of patients, the testing methods were not specified. Patients with untreated brain metastases or a 
history of ILD requiring treatment with prolonged steroids or other immunosuppressive agents within 
the last 2 years were not eligible for the study. Rybrevant was administered intravenously at 1,050 mg 
for patients < 80 kg or 1,400 mg for patients ≥ 80 kg once weekly for 4 weeks, then every 2 weeks 
starting at Week 5 until loss of clinical benefit or unacceptable toxicity. The primary efficacy endpoint
was investigator-assessed overall response rate (ORR), defined as confirmed complete response (CR)
or partial response (PR) based on RECIST v1.1. In addition, the primary endpoint was assessed by a
blinded independent central review (BICR). Secondary efficacy endpoints included duration of 
response (DOR).
The median age was 62 (range: 36–84) years, with 41% of the patients ≥ 65 years of age; 61% were 
female; and 52% were Asian and 37% were White. The median number of prior therapies was 2
(range: 1 to 7 therapies). At baseline, 29% had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
performance status of 0 and 70% had ECOG performance status of 1; 57% never smoked; 100% had 
Stage IV cancer; and 25% had previous treatment for brain metastases. Insertions in Exon 20 were 
observed at 8 different residues; the most common residues were A767 (22%), S768 (16%), D770 
(12%), and N771 (11%).

Elderly
No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between patients ≥ 65 years of age and patients 
< 65 years of age.
Paediatric population
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Rybrevant in all subsets of the paediatric population in non-small cell lung cancer (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use).
Conditional approval
This medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called ‘conditional approval’ scheme. This 
means that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. The European Medicines Agency 
will review new information on this medicinal product at least every year and this SmPC will be 
updated as necessary.
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Amivantamab area under the concentration-time curve (AUC1 week) increases proportionally over a 
dose range from 350 to 1,750 mg.
Following administration of Rybrevant at the recommended dose and schedule, the mean serum 
AUC1 week was approximately 2.9-fold higher after the fifth dose, following the weekly dosing,
compared to the first dose.
Steady state was achieved approximately 2 months into the every 2-week dosing period (by the ninth 
infusion) at 1,050 mg, and the mean serum AUC1 week was approximately 2.4 fold higher at steady state 
compared to the first dose.
Distribution
Amivantamab geometric mean (CV%) total volume of distribution, based on population PK parameter
estimates, was 5.37 (21%) L following administration of the recommended dose of Rybrevant.
Elimination
Amivantamab clearance is higher with low doses (< 350 mg) but linear within the clinical dose range.
The geometric mean (CV%) linear clearance was estimated to be 225 (25%) mL/day, based on 
population PK modelling. The geometric mean (CV%) terminal half-life associated with linear 
11
clearance, derived based on population PK parameter estimates, was 15.7 (26%) days, following 
administration of the recommended dose of Rybrevant as monotherapy.
Special populations
Elderly
No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of amivantamab were observed based on 
age (32-87 years).
Renal impairment
No clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of amivantamab was observed in patients 
with mild (60 ≤ creatinine clearance [CrCl] < 90 mL/min) and moderate (29 ≤ CrCl < 60 mL/min) 
renal impairment. The effect of severe renal impairment (15 ≤ CrCl < 29 mL/min) on amivantamab 
pharmacokinetics is unknown.
Hepatic impairment
Changes in hepatic function are unlikely to have any effect on the elimination of amivantamab since 
IgG1-based molecules such as amivantamab are not metabolised through hepatic pathways.
No clinically meaningful effect in the pharmacokinetics of amivantamab was observed based on mild 
hepatic impairment [(total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN) or (ULN < total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN)]. 
The effect of moderate (total bilirubin 1.5 to 3 times ULN) and severe (total bilirubin > 3 times ULN) 
hepatic impairment on amivantamab pharmacokinetics is unknown.
Paediatric population
The pharmacokinetics of Rybrevant in paediatric patients have not been investigated.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose 
toxicity.
Carcinogenicity and mutagenicity
No animal studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenic potential of amivantamab. 
Routine genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies are generally not applicable to biologic 
pharmaceuticals as large proteins cannot diffuse into cells and cannot interact with DNA or 
chromosomal material.
Reproductive toxicology
No animal studies have been conducted to evaluate the effects on reproduction and foetal 
development; however, based on its mechanism of action, amivantamab can cause foetal harm or 
developmental anomalies. As reported in the literature, reduction, elimination, or disruption of embryo 
foetal or maternal EGFR signaling can prevent implantation, cause embryo foetal loss during various 
stages of gestation (through effects on placental development), cause developmental anomalies in 
multiple organs or early death in surviving foetuses. Similarly, knock out of MET or its ligand 
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was embryonic lethal due to severe defects in placental development, 
and foetuses displayed defects in muscle development in multiple organs. Human IgG1 is known to 
cross the placenta; therefore, amivantamab has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the 
developing foetus.

6.6
Special precautions for disposal and other handling
Prepare the solution for intravenous infusion using aseptic technique as follows:
Preparation

Determine the dose required (either 1,050 mg for patients < 80 kg or 1,400 mg for patients
≥ 80 kg) and the number of Rybrevant vials needed based on patient’s baseline weight (see 
section 4.2). Each vial contains 350 mg of amivantamab.
Check that the Rybrevant solution is colourless to pale yellow. Do not use if discolouration or 
visible particles are present.
Withdraw and then discard a volume of either 5% glucose solution or sodium chloride 9 mg/mL 
(0.9%) solution for injection from the 250 mL infusion bag that is equal to the required volume 
of Rybrevant solution to be added (discard 7 mL diluent from the infusion bag for each vial).
Infusion bags must be made of polyvinylchloride (PVC), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene 
(PE), or polyolefin blend (PP+PE).
Withdraw 7 mL of Rybrevant from each vial needed then add it to the infusion bag. Each vial 
contains a 0.5 mL overfill to ensure sufficient extractable volume. The final volume in the 
infusion bag should be 250 mL. Discard any unused portion left in the vial.
Gently invert the bag to mix the solution. Do not shake.
Visually inspect for particulate matter and discolouration prior to administration. Do not use if 
discolouration or visible particles are observed.

Administration

Administer the diluted solution by intravenous infusion using an infusion set fitted with a flow 
regulator and with an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein-binding polyethersulfone 
(PES) filter (pore size 0.22 or 0.2 micrometer). Administration sets must be made of either 
polyurethane (PU), polybutadiene (PBD), PVC, PP, or PE.
Do not infuse Rybrevant concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other agents.
The diluted solution should be administered within 10 hours (including infusion time) at room 
temperature (15°C to 25°C) and in room light.
Due to the frequency of IRRs at the first dose, amivantamab should be infused via a peripheral 
vein at Week 1 and Week 2; infusion via a central line may be administered for subsequent 
weeks when the risk of IRR is lower. See infusion rates in section 4.2.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What Rybrevant is and what it is used for
What Rybrevant is
Rybrevant is a cancer medicine. It contains the active substance ‘amivantamab’, which is an antibody
(type of protein) designed to recognise and attach to specific targets in the body.
What Rybrevant is used for
Rybrevant is used in adults with a type of lung cancer called ‘non-small cell lung cancer’. It is used 
when the cancer has spread to other parts of your body and has gone through certain changes (Exon 20 
insertion mutations) in a gene called ‘EGFR’.
How Rybrevant works
The active substance in Rybrevant, amivantamab, targets two proteins found on cancer cells:


This medicine works by attaching to these proteins. This may help to slow or stop your lung cancer 
from growing. It may also help to reduce the size of the tumour.
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and
mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET).
2. What you need to know before you are given Rybrevant
Do not use Rybrevant if

you are allergic to amivantamab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).
Do not use this medicine if the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse 
before you are given this medicine.
Warnings and precautions
Tell your doctor or nurse before you are given Rybrevant if:

you have suffered from inflammation of your lungs (a condition called ‘interstitial lung disease’
or ‘pneumonitis’).
24
Tell your doctor or nurse straight away while taking this medicine if you get any of the following 
side effects (see section 4 for more information):



Any side effect while the medicine is being given into your vein.
Sudden difficulty in breathing, cough, or fever that may suggest inflammation of the lungs.
Skin problems. To reduce the risk of skin problems, keep out of the sun, wear protective 
clothing, apply sunscreen, and use moisturisers regularly on your skin and nails while taking 
this medicine. You will need to continue doing this for 2 months after you stop treatment.
Eye problems. If you have vision problems or eye pain contact your doctor or nurse straight 
away. If you use contact lenses and have any new eye symptoms, stop using contact lenses and 
tell your doctor straight away.

Children and adolescents
Do not give this medicine to children or young people below 18 years of age. This is because it is not 
known whether the medicine is safe and effective in this age group.
Other medicines and Rybrevant
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.
Contraception

If you could become pregnant, you must use effective contraception during Rybrevant treatment 
and for 3 months after stopping treatment.
Pregnancy


Tell your doctor or nurse before you are given this medicine if you are pregnant, think you 
might be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby.
It is possible that this medicine may harm an unborn baby. If you become pregnant while being 
treated with this medicine, tell your doctor or nurse straight away. You and your doctor will 
decide if the benefit of having the medicine is greater than the risk to your unborn baby.
Breast-feeding
It is not known if Rybrevant passes into breast milk. Ask your doctor for advice before being given 
this medicine. You and your doctor will decide if the benefit of breast-feeding is greater than the risk 
to your baby.
Driving and using machines
If you feel tired, feel dizzy, or if your eyes are irritated or vision is affected after taking Rybrevant, do 
not drive or use machinery.
Rybrevant contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. However, before Rybrevant is given to you, it may be mixed with a solution that 
contains sodium. Talk to your doctor if you are on a low salt diet.
3.
How Rybrevant is given
How much is given
Your doctor will work out the correct dose of Rybrevant for you. The dose of this medicine will 
depend on your body weight at the start of your therapy.
The recommended dose of Rybrevant is:


1,050 mg if you weigh less than 80 kg.
1,400 mg if you weigh more than or equal to 80 kg.
25
How the medicine is given
This medicine will be given to you by a doctor or nurse. It is given as a drip into a vein (‘intravenous 
infusion’) over several hours.
Rybrevant is given as follows:


once a week for the first 4 weeks
then once every 2 weeks starting at week 5, for as long as you keep getting benefit from the 
treatment.
In the first week, your doctor will give you the Rybrevant dose split over two days.
Medicines given during treatment with Rybrevant
Before each infusion of Rybrevant, you will be given medicines which help lower the chance of 
infusion-related reactions. These may include:



medicines for an allergic reaction (antihistamines)
medicines for inflammation (corticosteroids)
medicines for fever (such as paracetamol).
You may also be given additional medicines based on any symptoms you may experience.
If you are given more Rybrevant than you should
This medicine will be given by your doctor or nurse. In the unlikely event that you are given too much 
(an overdose), your doctor will check you for side effects.
If you forget your appointment to have Rybrevant
It is very important to go to all your appointments. If you miss an appointment, make another one as 
soon as possible.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse.
4.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:
This medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned
below.
Prepare the solution for intravenous infusion using aseptic technique as follows:
Preparation

Determine the dose required (either 1,050 mg or 1,400 mg) and the number of Rybrevant vials 
needed based on patient’s baseline weight. Each vial of Rybrevant contains 350 mg of 
amivantamab.
Check that the Rybrevant solution is colourless to pale yellow. Do not use if discolouration or 
visible particles are present.
Withdraw and then discard a volume of either 5% glucose solution or sodium chloride 9 mg/mL 
(0.9%) solution for injection from the 250 mL infusion bag that is equal to the required volume 
of Rybrevant solution to be added (discard 7 mL diluent from the infusion bag for each vial). 
Infusion bags must be made of polyvinylchloride (PVC), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene 
(PE), or polyolefin blend (PP+PE).
Withdraw 7 mL of Rybrevant from each vial needed then add it to the infusion bag. Each vial 
contains a 0.5 mL overfill to ensure sufficient extractable volume. The final volume in the 
infusion bag should be 250 mL. Discard any unused portion left in the vial.
Gently invert the bag to mix the solution. Do not shake.
Visually inspect for particulate matter and discolouration prior to administration. Do not use if 
discolouration or visible particles are observed.
Administration

Administer the diluted solution by intravenous infusion using an infusion set fitted with a flow 
regulator and with an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein-binding polyethersulfone 
(PES) filter (pore size 0.22 or 0.2 micrometer). Administration sets must be made of either 
polyurethane (PU), polybutadiene (PBD), PVC, PP, or PE.
Do not infuse Rybrevant concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other agents.
The diluted solution should be administered within 10 hours (including infusion time) at room 
temperature (15°C to 25°C) and in room light.
Due to the frequency of IRRs at the first dose, amivantamab should be infused via a peripheral 
vein at Week 1 and Week 2; infusion via a central line may be administered for subsequent 
weeks when the risk of IRR is lower.

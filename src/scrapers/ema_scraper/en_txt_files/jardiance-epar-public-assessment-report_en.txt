2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
The  most  common  type  of  diabetes  is  type  2  diabetes,  which  is  characterised  by  insulin 
resistance, impaired insulin secretion, and increased glucose production. Type 2 diabetes is also 
associated with microvascular complications and elevated cardiovascular  risk. Treatment of type 
2  diabetes  usually  involves  lifestyle  interventions  such  as  diet  and  exercise,  as  well  as  the 
administration  of  antidiabetic  drugs.  Although  initially  effective,  currently  available  oral 
antidiabetic agents often fail to maintain long-term glycaemic control or are associated with side 
effects,  often  including  weight  gain,  which  may  limit  their  use.  Hence,  there  is  a  need  for  new 
therapeutic options to provide sustained improvements in glycaemic control and to contribute to 
reducing cardiovascular risk factors such as overweight and hypertension in patients with type 2 
diabetes. 
The  kidney  has  a  role  in  the  regulation  of  blood  glucose  levels  and  can  therefore  serve  as  a 
target  for  new  antidiabetic  drugs.  The  sodium-dependent  glucose  co-transporter  2  (SGLT  2)  is 
expressed  in  the  renal  proximal  tubules  and  accounts  for  approximately  90%  of  renal  glucose 
reabsorption.  Inhibition  of  SGLT  2  decreases  the  renal  reabsorption  of  glucose,  thereby 
promoting  glucose  excretion  in  the  urine  with  a  consequent  reduction  in  blood  glucose  levels. 
Due to their mainly insulin-independent mechanism of action, SGLT 2 inhibitors may have a low 
risk  of  hypoglycaemia.  Further  effects  of  SGLT  2  inhibition  may  include  weight  loss  due  to  the 
calorie loss associated with increased glucose excretion and a reduction in blood pressure that is 
possibly due to a mild diuretic effect. 
Empagliflozin is a novel, orally administered, potent, and selective SGLT 2 inhibitor.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as a film-coated tablet containing either 10 or 25 mg of 
empagliflozin as active substance.  
Other ingredients are lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, 
croscarmellose sodium, colloidal anhydrous silica, magnesium stearate, hypromellose, titanium 
dioxide (E171), talc, macrogol 400 and iron oxide yellow (E172). 
The product is available in perforated PVC/aluminium unit dose blisters. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The chemical name of empagliflozin is (1S)-1,5-anhydro-1-(4-chloro-3-{4-[(3S)-
tetrahydrofuran-3-yloxy]benzyl}phenyl)-D-glucitol, also known as D-Glucitol,1,5-anhydro-1-C-
[4-chloro-3-[[4-[[(3S)-tetrahydro-3-furanyl]oxy]phenyl]methyl]phenyl]-(1S), and has the 
following structure: 
The  structure  of  empagliflozin  was  unambiguously  confirmed  by  1H  and  13C  NMR,  UV 
spectroscopy, FT-IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. 
Empagliflozin  is  a  white  to  yellowish  non-hygroscopic  crystalline  solid,  very  slightly  soluble  in 
water (pH 1-7.4), slightly soluble in acetonitrile and ethanol, sparingly soluble in methanol, and 
practically insoluble in toluene. 
Empagliflozin  is  chiral  and  possesses  6  stereogenic  centres.  Enantiomeric  purity  is  controlled 
routinely  by  suitable  analytical  methods.  A  single  polymorphic  form  has  been  observed  for 
empagliflozin which is non-solvated and non-hydrated. 
The active substance is a chemical substance not previously authorised as a medicinal product in 
the European Union. Furthermore, it is neither a salt, complex, derivative, isomer (or mixture of 
isomers) of a previously authorised substance. Empagliflozin thus meets the definition of a New 
Active Substance according to the Notice to Applicants (NtA), Vol 2A, Chapter 1, Annex 3 and a 
Marketing  Authorisation  Application  in  accordance  with  Article  8(3)  of  Directive  2001/83/EC 
pertaining to a New Active Substance is justified. 
Manufacture 
The  manufacture  of  the  active  substance  was  satisfactorily  described  including  a  flow  chart. 
Empagliflozin  is  synthesized  from  well-defined  starting  materials  with  acceptable  specifications. 
Enough  of  the  manufacturing  process  is  described  and  the  physicochemical  properties  of  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/137741/2014 
Page 9/99 
 
  
  
 
active  substance  are  well  controlled  by  the  process.  Potential  and  actual  impurities  were  well 
discussed  with  regards  to  their  origin  and  fate  and  characterised.  The  characterisation  of  the 
active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new 
active substances. 
Adequate  in-process  controls  are  applied  during  the  synthesis.  The  specifications  and  control 
methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented and are 
considered adequate. 
Specification 
The  active  substance  specification  includes tests  for  appearance,  identity  (IR,  HPLC),  impurities 
(HPLC),  diaseteromer  (chiral  HPLC),  assay  (HPLC),  residual  solvents  (GC),  water  content  (KF), 
residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), and particle size (laser diffraction). Optical purity is controlled by a 
test  for  specific  optical  rotation.  The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described 
and appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.   
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified 
by toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set.  Impurity limits 
will be re-evaluated when sufficient commercial scale experience has been gained to fully assess 
the capability of the active substance manufacturing process.  
Batch  analysis  data  on  11  commercial  scale  batches  of  the  active  substance  are  provided.  The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. Batch analysis data on a 
further 35 pilot scale batches carried out using previous incarnations of the synthetic process and 
used  for  toxicology  and  clinical  studies  are  also  provided,  with  all  batches  conforming  to 
specifications in place at the time. 
Stability 
Stability  data  on  three  commercial  scale  batches  of  empagliflozin  manufactured  using  the 
proposed commercial process stored in the intended commercial packaging for up to 24 months 
under  long  term  conditions  (25  ºC  /  60%  RH)  and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated 
conditions  (40  ºC  /  75%  RH)  according  to the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  Stability  was  also 
tested under stressed conditions in the solid state (1 commercial scale batch) and in solution (1 
development  batch).  Solid  state  photostability  testing  following  the  ICH  guideline  Q1B  was 
performed  on  1  commercial  scale  batch.  Solid  state  material  was  also  exposed  to  high 
temperature (80 oC) and to open storage conditions (40  oC / 75% RH). Empagliflozin was tested 
in solution at low (2.5), intrinsic, and high (13) pH, each under heat stress conditions (80  oC), in 
the presence of strong (H2O2), or mild (AIBN) oxidants, and under UV irradiation. The following 
parameters  were  tested:  appearance,  impurities  (HPLC),  diaseteromer  (chiral  HPLC),  assay 
(HPLC), water content (KF) and particle size (laser diffraction). The analytical methods used were 
the same as for release. 
No  changes  to  any  test  parameters  were  observed  under  long  term  or  accelerated  conditions. 
Empagliflozin is neither photosensitive, nor affected by high temperature or humidity in the solid 
state. In solution, empagliflozin is prone to degradation at low and high pH and in the  presence 
of a strong oxidant. It is also unstable to a mild oxidant at high pH and slightly sensitive to light.

None  of  the  chiral  centres  showed  any  propensity  to  epimerisation  during  the  stability  studies. 
The results demonstrate that the analytical methods are stability indicating. 
The  stability  results indicate  that the  drug  substance  manufactured  by  the  proposed  supplier  is 
sufficiently  stable.  The  stability  results  justify  the  proposed  retest  period  in  the  proposed 
container.  Primary  stability  studies  on  the  3  commercial  batches  will  continue  up  until  the 
proposed re-test period. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical development 
The objective of formulation development was to develop an immediate-release oral dosage form 
of  empagliflozin  with  reliable  release  and  bioavailability.  The  active  substance  is  a  crystalline 
solid, routinely manufactured as a single polymorphic form. It is very slightly soluble in aqueous 
media between pH 1-7.5 but has low intestinal permeability (BCS class III). Particle size was not 
found to be critical for dissolution, but since coarser API dissolves slightly more slowly, the drug 
substance is milled and particle size is tightly controlled. 
All excipients are  well known pharmaceutical  ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. 
Eur.  standards  except  for  the  Opadry  yellow  film-coating  which  is  manufactured  by  an 
established supplier and tested according to established methods.  There are no novel excipients 
used  in  the  finished  product  formulation.  The  list  of  excipients  is  included  in  section  6.1  of  the 
SmPC.  Their compatibility with  the active substance  was demonstrated during the development 
process. The compositions of the 2 tablet strengths are not proportional. 
A  wet  granulation  process  was  used  throughout  development,  during  which  several  trial 
formulations were  developed. The final  formulation, used in the phase  III  clinical trial, contains 
the same excipients as those used in earlier development, the levels of which were optimised to 
improve  in  vivo  performance.  Bioequivalence  between  the  final  and  earlier  clinical  formulations 
was demonstrated in vivo. 
The  principles  of  Quality  by  Design  were  applied  to  the  pharmaceutical  development.  A  quality 
target product profile (QTPP) was established and is defined as a  once daily orally administered 
immediate  release  film-coated  tablet  available  in  2  strengths  (10  and  25  mg)  with  adequate 
purity,  chemical,  physical  and  mechanical  stability,  an  appearance  suitable  to  ensure  patient 
compliance,  and  a  3  year  shelf-life  which  is  stored  in  a  product-compatible  package  with 
adequate protection from environmental conditions so as to ensure adequate and reliable in vivo 
performance. 
Critical  quality  attributes  (CQAs)  were  suitably  defined.  The  different  steps  of  the  tableting 
process were evaluated through the use of risk assessment  to identify potential critical material 
attributes  and  critical  process  parameters  based  on  the  prior  experience  from  formulation 
development.  Those  with  a  potential  to  impact  on  the  CQAs  were  investigated  experimentally. 
CMAs are controlled by IPCs at relevant points in the manufacturing process. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/137741/2014

The  primary  packaging  is  PVC/aluminium  perforated  unit  dose  blisters.  The  material  complies 
with  Ph.  Eur.  and  EC  requirements.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been 
validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition 
as  those  used  to  collect  milk  for  human  consumption  and  that  the  lactose  has  been  prepared 
without the use of  ruminant material  other than calf  rennet according to the Note for Guidance 
on  Minimising  the  Risk  of  Transmitting  Animal  Spongiform  Encephalopathy  Agents  via  Human 
and Veterinary Medicinal Products. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process consists of 4 main steps including granulation, blending, compression 
and  film-coating.  The  process  is  considered  to  be  a  standard  manufacturing  process.  Critical 
material attributes are assured by IPCs at relevant points in the process. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by 3 commercial scale batches for 
both strengths of tablet. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of 
producing  the  finished  product  of  intended  quality  in  a  reproducible  manner.  The  in-process 
controls are adequate for the production of Jardiance film-coated tablets. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  comprise  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage 
form including  description  (visual test),  identification (HPLC and  UV),  degradants (HPLC),  assay 
(HPLC), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of dosage unit (HPLC) and  microbiological quality (Ph. 
Eur.,  skip  lot  testing  as  per  ICH  Q6A).  The  absence  of  tests  for  organic  solvents,  inorganic 
impurities, disintegration and water content has been adequately justified by the applicant. The 
discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated. 
Batch  analysis  results  for  13  commercial  scale  batches  confirm  the  consistency  of  the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability  data  of  3  commercial  scale  batches  of  finished  product  stored  under  long  term 
conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) for up to 36 months and under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% 
RH) for up to 6 months according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of Jardiance 
are  identical  to  those  proposed  for  marketing  and  were  packed  in  the  primary  packaging 
proposed for marketing. Samples were tested for description, degradants, assay, dissolution and 
microbiological  quality.  No  relevant  change  or  trend  to  any  of  the  measured  parameters  was 
observed under either condition. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
In addition, stressed stability studies were carried out on 1 commercial scale batch. The finished 
product was exposed for 6 months to heat (60 oC, closed amber bottle) and various open storage 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/137741/2014 
Page 12/99 
 
  
  
conditions (25  oC / 60% RH, 30 oC / 75% RH, 40  oC / 75% RH). It was also exposed to light as 
defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. No 
relevant change or trend to any of the measured parameters was observed on exposure to light 
or heat. Only a minor increase in water content and decrease in hardness is observed under open 
storage conditions but these do not impact the tablet performance. 
Stability  studies  on  2  commercial  scale  batches  of  bulk  drug  product  stored  under  warehouse 
conditions reveal no significant changes in any of the test parameters. 
Based on the available stability data, the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in 
the SmPC are acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information  on  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  active  substance  and  finished 
product  has  been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to 
the  conclusion  that  the  product  should  have  a  satisfactory  and  uniform  performance  in  clinical 
use.  
The  applicant  has  applied  QbD  principles  in  the  development  of  the  finished  product  and  its 
manufacturing process. However, no design spaces were claimed.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions  on  the  chemical,  pharmaceutical  and  biological 
aspects 
The  quality  of  this  product  is  considered  to  be  acceptable  when  used  in  accordance  with  the 
conditions  defined  in  the  SmPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform 
clinical  performance  of  the  product  have  been  investigated  and  are  controlled  in  a  satisfactory 
way. Data has been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In  the  context  of  the  obligation  of  the  MAHs  to  take  due  account  of  technical  and  scientific 
progress, the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
Review  the  limits  for  impurities  when  sufficient  commercial  scale  experience  has  been 
gained  to  fully  assess  the  capability  of  the  active  substance  manufacturing  process.  If 
necessary,  the  specification  of  the  active  substance  should  be  tightened  via  the 
appropriate regulatory procedure.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology 
In vitro studies using transfected HEK and CHO cells showed that empagliflozin is a selective and 
potent inhibitor of  the human, rat and  mouse  glucose  transporter SGLT2  (IC50: 1.3 nM, 1.7 nM 
and 1.7 nM respectively). Receptor kinetics show that the affinity (Kd) of empagliflozin for SGLT2 
is reduced in the presence  of  glucose, indicating competitive binding to the receptor. Affinity to 
other  human  SGLT’s  were  5000-fold,  >3500-fold,  >350-fold  and  >600-fold  lower  for  SGLT1, 
SGLT4,  SGLT5  and  SGLT6  respectively.  Of  these,  only  SGLT1  and  SGLT2  are  expressed  to  a 
relevant  degree  in  the  kidney.  Likewise,  empagliflozin  up  to  10  µM  did  not  have  an  effect  on 
glucose  transport  via  a  glucose  transporter expressed  in  most  cells,  GLUT1.  It  should  be  noted 
that there is no in vitro data available for the dog. This can be accepted, since efficacy is shown 
in vivo. 
Three glucuronide metabolites of empagliflozin have low affinity for SGLT2, and these therefore 
do not contribute to the pharmacological effect of empagliflozin. In a safety pharmacology study, 
the applicant mentions an “active” metabolite. In the pharmacokinetic section it appears that this 
metabolite is a major component in rats, however, it is shown that this metabolite is not present 
at  relevant  levels  in  human  plasma  (up  to  0.12%).  Therefore  this  metabolite  has  not  been 
investigated separately. 
A  panel  of  98  human,  rat,  mouse,  and  rabbit  enzymes  and  receptors  were  not  affected  by 
exposure  to  empagliflozin  up  to  10  µM.  Selectivity  of  empagliflozin  was  further  confirmed  in 
another panel showing no relevant activity in 106 assays that  span a broad  area of  the human 
proteome  consisting  of  49  receptor  binding  assays,  21  ion  channel  binding  assays,  29  enzyme 
and  uptake  assays,  7  in  vitro  metabolism  assays,  one  cellular  and  nuclear  receptor  functional 
assay and another study in which empagliflozin was tested in 50 kinase assays. 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The primary pharmacodynamics effect of  empagliflozin on inhibition of glucose re-uptake in the 
kidneys,  was  demonstrated  in  mice,  rats  and  dogs.  All  species  showed  increased  urine  glucose 
concentrations  after  treatment.  In  dogs  the  ED50  was  determined  at  0.9  mg/kg  empagliflozin. 
Urine volume was also increased, especially in dogs treated with 10 mg/kg empagliflozin. This is 
an  expected  effect,  since  SGLT2  is  a  co-transporter  of  glucose,  sodium  and  water  molecules. 
Increased  urine  glucose  excretion  leads  to  lowered  blood  glucose  concentration,  as  shown  in 
diabetic  db/dbmice  and  ZDF  rats.  A  reduction  of  up  to  46%  was  seen  after  a  single  dose  of  3 
mg/kg,  with  an  estimated  ED50  of  0.6  mg/kg  for  both  species.  The  effect  lasted  for  at  least  7 
hours in rats.  Doses  as low as 1 mg/kg  in  mice  and  rats had  a significant effect on lowering of 
blood glucose levels after an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Further, the effect on glycemic 
control  was  evaluated  in  ZDF  rats  after  5  weeks  treatment  of  up  to  3  mg/kg  empagliflozin. 
Prandial and fasting blood glucose lowering lasted up to 16 hours post-dose. The diabetic ZDF rat 
has an increased HbA1c, which was reduced by treatment with empagliflozin.

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In secondary pharmacology evaluations, treatment with 10 mg/kg/day empagliflozin for 28 days, 
has  an  effect  on  body  weight  loss  in  obese  rats.  This  is  likely  due  to  a  small  decrease  in  food 
consumption,  together  with  the  pharmacological  effect  of  inhibition  of  glucose  re-uptake  in  the 
kidneys.  Of  note,  in  the  repeated  dose  toxicology  studies,  healthy  rats  generally  had  increased 
food consumption. This is probably due to a compensatory reaction in relation to a reduction in 
blood glucose, which is not seen in obese rats. Urine glucose excretion was increased and serum 
glucose decreased from 3 mg/kg, the lowest dose tested, whereas urine Na+, Cl- and osmolality 
were increased at the mid and high dose (10 and 30 mg/kg), when measured in the first 4 hours 
after treatment. Serum electrolytes also seem to be effected, especially potassium and chloride 
(increased  in  urine),  as  well  as  serum  free  fatty  acids  (increased  in  serum).  Regarding  the 
increase  in  serum  free  fatty  acids,  this  could  be  the  result  of  compensation  for  energy  source, 
due to the drop in glucose levels. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
In  a  battery  of  safety  pharmacology  studies,  empagliflozin  was  evaluated  for  effects  on  central 
nervous  system,  respiratory  system,  gastro-intestinal  system,  and  cardiovascular  system. 
Empagliflozin had no effect on the central nervous system of mice and rats, when administered 
up to 30 mg/kg and up to 2000 mg/kg respectively. Also, no effect on the respiratory system of 
rats  was  seen,  when  administered  up  to  2000  mg/kg.  There  was  no  effect  of  intraduodenal 
administration of empagliflozin on gastric secretion in a gastric ulcer rat-model, and no effect of 
treatment was seen on intestinal motility in rats. The high dose of 30 mg/kg did have an effect 
on  gastric  emptying,  which  was  increased  by  33%.  No  toxicokinetic  data  is  available  from  this 
study,  but  from  the  repeated  dose  studies,  it  can  be  extrapolated  that  a  dose  of  30  mg/kg 
corresponds  to  a  AUC  of  approximately  10  M.h.  This  is  in  excess  of  the  AUC  of  4740  nM.h  for 
humans at the recommended dose, and therefore the effect is likely not relevant. There was no 
effect on hERG tail current by empagliflozin up to 10.0 µM. Two in vivo studies were performed in 
conscious  dogs  up  to  100  mg/kg  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  empagliflozin  in  cardiovascular 
parameters.  There  was  no  effect  on  any  parameter  that  could  be  related  to  treatment. 
Cardiovascular  parameters  were  also  measured  in  a  number  of  repeated  dose  toxicity  studies, 
which  revealed  no  effects  due  to  treatment  with  empagliflozin.  The  doses  used  in  the  safety 
pharmacology  studies  result  in  exposures  that  are  in  excess  of  the  clinical  exposure  at  the 
recommended dose. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Several  combination  studies  were  performed,  to  evaluate  if  empagliflozin  can  have  an  additive 
effect  on  the  blood  glucose  lowering  effect  of  some  existing  substances  of  different  classes,  on 
the  market  for  treatment  of  type  II  diabetes.  Combination  treatment  with  metformin,  a 
sulphonylurea  (glipizide),  a  DPP-4  inhibitor  (linagliptin),  a  GLP-1  analog  (exendin-4),  an  α-
glucosidase  inhibitor  (voglibose),  a  PPARγ  agonist  (pioglitazone)  and  with  insulin  resulted  in 
greater improvement in glucose tolerance in ZDF rats compared to each individual monotherapy.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Empagliflozin  was  absorbed  well  after  oral  dosing  in  mouse,  rat  and  dog.  Oral  bioavailability 
following  administration  of  empagliflozin  was  moderate  to  high  in  mouse  and  dog  (>81%)  and 
low in rat (25-33%). After iv administration of empagliflozin, plasma clearance differed between 
the species examined, varying from  low in dog  (1.7-1.8 ml/min/kg) and rat (12-15 ml/min/kg) 
to  moderate  in  mouse  (33-40  ml/min/kg).  The  volume  of  distribution  was  0.5-1.2  L/kg  in  all 
species,  which  indicates  reasonable  distribution  into  tissues.  The  half-live  values  were  long  in 
general, but it is hard to draw conclusions since half-lives were not only variable between species 
but also within species. Following repeated doses, the exposure to empagliflozin increased dose-
proportional in mice, rats and dogs, except for female rats in the 2 years study where a less than 
proportionally  increase  with  dose  was  observed  and  in  the  52-week  study  in  dogs  where  a 
slightly  greater  than  dose-proportional  increase  was  observed  between  the  mid  and  high  dose 
levels. There were no consistent trends suggesting an effect of repeated dosing on Cmax or AUC, 
indicating  that there  was little or  no  accumulation  of  empagliflozin.  Empagliflozin  Cmax  and  AUC 
values were consistently greater in females compared to males in mice, rats and dogs, with a few 
exceptions.  
Binding to plasma proteins is high in all species examined for empagliflozin (87-92%). In human 
plasma,  protein  binding  was  82-84%,  and  this  binding  was  predominantly  to  albumin.  Protein 
binding of  empagliflozin  was independent on  the  concentration in  the  range investigated, which 
indicates  no  saturation  of  binding  sites.  The  concentration  range  (0.01-40  µg/mL)  covers  the 
plasma  levels  at  indicated  clinical  application  (Cmax  in  humans  is  0.3  µg/mL).  Partitioning  of 
empagliflozin into red blood cells was limited and independent of the concentration in any of the 
species  investigated.  Distribution  of  drug-related  radioactivity  into  tissue  was  limited.  Highest 
tissue  concentrations  were  observed  1  hour  after  administration  and  were  measured  in 
gastrointestinal  tract  contents,  urine,  and  bile.  Empagliflozin-related  radioactivity  was  not 
distributed into  the central nervous system  at any time point analysed. Besides the contents of 
the gastrointestinal tract and urine, drug-related radioactivity was still observed after 24 hours in 
the  kidney,  suggesting  some  accumulation  of  empagliflozin-related  material  may  occur  when 
using daily. Distribution into the renal cortex was similar in rats and mice and showed no gender 
specificity.  Binding  to  melanin  was  not  observed.  Empagliflozin  crosses  the  placenta  barrier  in 
rats, although at low levels. Placental transfer in humans may be expected based on the results. 
This has been included in the SmPC. 
In vitro  data suggest that metabolism of empagliflozin is low  in humans and  that CYP enzymes 
do  not  contribute  significantly  to  empagliflozin  metabolism.  However,  compared  to  humans,  in 
vitro  metabolism  was  higher  in  the  animals  examined,  especially  in  rats.  Three  glucuronide 
conjugates are present in human plasma, though each glucuronide represents less than <10% of 
the parent AUC when tested at the supratherapeutic dose of 50 mg. In the pre-clinical species, 
oxidation  of  empagliflozin  is  the  primary  metabolism  pathway.  UGT1A3,  1A8,  1A9  and  2B7  are 
identified  to  be  involved  in  the  glucuronidation  of  empagliflozin.  The  enzymes  involved  in  the 
(oxidative)  metabolism  of  empagliflozin  in  animals  have  not  been  identified.  In  mechanistic 
studies  concerning  the  finding  of  renal  tumours  in  male  mice  the  formation  of  an  instable 
metabolite  was  identified,  which  led  to  the  formation  of  the  cytotoxic  compound  4-hydroxy-
crotonaldehyde (4OH-CTA). The Applicant provided the metabolite patterns in plasma of mouse, 
rat, dog and humans as percentage of  radioactivity and as concentration (in nM) in the sample 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/137741/2014 
Page 16/99 
 
  
  
per individual sampling time point. This hampered an interspecies comparison of the metabolite 
pattern  in  the  pre-clinical  species  with  that  in  humans  in  a  quantitative/proportional  manner. 
Qualitatively, based on the metabolite profile provided for the non-clinical species and humans, it 
can be concluded that oxidation is the major metabolic pathway in the non-clinical species while 
direct glucuronidation is the major metabolic pathway in humans. The provided data indicate that 
all  metabolites  observed  in  humans  are  also  observed  in  the  pre-clinical  species,  except  for  a 
fourth glucuronide present in human plasma only at trace levels. Furthermore, the data suggest 
that after repeated dosing metabolites accumulate in the pre-clinical species as indicated by the 
AUCm/p  ratios  even  up  to  ~9400%.  This  accumulation  is  not  observed  in  humans.  Covalent 
binding  studies  in  liver  microsomes  suggest  that  empagliflozin  has  a  low  potential  for  reactive 
intermediate formation via phase I metabolism in humans. 
Generally, across the non-clinical species, faecal and/or biliary excretion are the most important 
elimination routes. In rats, biliary excretion is found to be a major route of excretion. However, 
empagliflozin and its related radioactivity may also be directly secreted into the intestine via drug 
transporters  such  as  BCRP.  In  humans,  both  renal  (~54%)  and  faecal  (~41%)  excretion  are 
important  elimination  routes  in  contrast  to  most  observations  in  the  non-clinical  species. 
Empagliflozin may be excreted via milk with milk:plasma ratios up to 5.0 as is observed in rats.  
Empagliflozin  is  not  an  in  vitro  inducer  of  CYP  at  clinically  relevant  organ  and  intestinal 
concentrations. Therefore, no in vivo CYP induction and correspondingly drug-drug interactions in 
humans is expected. 
Empagliflozin is not an inhibitor of CYPs 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4 at clinically intestinal 
and  systemic  concentrations.  Empagliflozin  is  not  expected to  be  a  CYP2C9  inhibitor  in  vivo.  In 
addition,  empagliflozin  or  its  glucuronides  are  not  considered  irreversible  CYP  inhibitors.  Thus, 
drug-drug  interactions  involving  the  investigated  CYPs  are  considered  unlikely.  At  maximum 
organ  concentrations,  empagliflozin  is  not  an  inhibitor  of  UGT1A1.  UGTs  involved  in  the 
glucuronidation  of  empagliflozin,  i.e.  UGT1A3,  1A8,  1A9  and  2B7  were  not  investigated  by  the 
Applicant. According to the EMA drug-drug interaction guideline, it is recommended to study the 
UGTs  involved  in  the  glucuronidation.  The  Applicant  stated  that  UGT2B7  is  involved  in  the 
formation of M/626/1 and UGT1A3, 1A8, 1A9 and 2B7 in the formation of M626/3. At therapeutic 
concentrations  UGT2B7  is  not  involved  in  the  formation  of  M626/1  and  M626/3.  However, 
M626/1 was formed in patients at clinically relevant dosing, indicating that either UGT2B7 or an 
unknown UGT is involved in patients in the formation of this metabolite.  
Empagliflozin is an inhibitor of the efflux transporters BCRP and MRP2, and of the hepatic uptake 
transporters  OATP1B1,  OATP1B3  and  OATP2B1  and  of  the  renal  uptake  transporter  OAT3.  The 
contribution of oatp1a1/Oatp1a1 toward  the overall  transport of empagliflozin into kidney slices 
from  rat  and  mouse  is  very  small  compared  to  oat3/Oat3  and  sglt(s)/Sglt(s).  At  systemic  and 
local  organ  concentrations  achieved  after  the  maximum  therapeutic  dose,  no  drug-drug 
interactions involving inhibition of these transporters are expected in vivo. Glucuronidation is the 
major  metabolism  pathway  in  humans.  Therefore,  inhibition  of  UGTs  by  concomitantly  drug 
administration  could  potentially  lead  to  drug-drug  interactions.  Empagliflozin  is  a  substrate  for 
the  efflux  transporters  P-gp  and  BCRP.  No  clinically  relevant  increase  of  the  plasma 
concentrations  of  empagliflozin  is  expected  by  P-gp  and  BCRP  inhibition  by  concomitant 
administration  of  P-gp  and  BCRP  inhibitors,  since  the  absolute  bioavailability  of  orally 
administered  empagliflozin  is high and linear kinetics are  observed. However, increased plasma 
Assessment report

Page 17/99 
 
  
  
concentrations  due  to  the  inhibition  of  the  excretion  by  P-gp  and  BCRP  cannot  be  ruled  out. 
Empagliflozin  is  a  substrate  of  two  uptake  transporters  expressed  in  the  liver,  OATP1B1  and 
OATP1B3, and of one kidney transporter, OAT3, at local organ concentrations. Inhibition of these 
transporters  by  concomitantly  administered  drugs  may  have  an  effect  on  the  drug  disposition 
and elimination of empagliflozin. 
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Acute  toxicity  of  empagliflozin  was  tested  in  mice  and  rats  by  oral  and  intraperitoneal 
administration up to 2000 mg/kg and appeared to be low with mortality only seen in mice above 
300 mg/kg by the intraperitoneal route. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
In  a  13-week  repeated  dose  toxicity  in  mice,  the  kidneys  and  liver  were  identified  as  target 
organs.  Increased  kidney  weights  and  cystic  tubular  hyperplasia  were  seen  in  both  sexes  at  all 
dose  levels,  but  tubular  single  cell  necrosis,  tubular  hypertrophy,  tubular  karyomegaly  and 
exacerbation of the proliferative  marker Ki-67 were treatment-related findings in males only. In 
the  mouse  carcinogenicity  study,  cystic  tubular  hyperplasia  is  associated  with  tubular  cysts, 
lower  urinary  tract  dilatation  and  increased  mortality  in  males.  Increased  liver  weights  seen  in 
both sexes were due to an exacerbation of midzonal hydropic change. The cause of the hydropic 
changes was not discussed by the Applicant. It could point to electrolyte imbalances, but clinical 
chemistry data only contained data for calcium and not sodium or potassium. Slight decreases in 
plasma calcium and inorganic phosphorus were not considered adverse. Swollen abdomen (in the 
carcinogenicity  study)  and  abnormal  feces  suggest  empagliflozin  administration  may  interfere 
with normal digestion. Based on the histopathological findings in males the NOAEL in this study 
should be considered to be less than 500 mg/kg/day, corresponding to a Cmax of <32.4 µM and 
an AUC of <130 µM.h. 
These  findings  were  confirmed  in  a  second  mechanistic  13-week  toxicity  study  in  mice  with 
interim  sacrifices  and  further  analysis  of  the  kidneys.  Administration  of  empagliflozin  changed 
transcript  levels  of  genes  related  to  renal  development  and  function,  cell  cycle  regulation,  cell 
proliferation,  cell  to  cell  signalling,  cell  adhesion  and  cytoskeleton  in  high  dose  male  mouse 
specifically when compared to vehicle groups. 
Repeat dose  oral  toxicity evaluations  in  rat  included  studies  of  2,  4, 13,  and  26  week  duration 
[05R214,  06R073,  07R036,  08R019].  In  the  4  week  study,  the  doses  were  30,  100,  and  1000 
mg/kg/day, and in the 13, and 26 week studies, the doses were 30, 100, and 700 mg/kg/day. In 
all  studies  there  was  a  largely  consistent  pattern  of  observations  including  increases  in  food 
consumption,  decreases  in  body  weight  gain,  decreases  in  plasma  glucose,  glucosuria  and 
polyuria,  all  of  which  are  related  to  the  primary  mode  of  pharmacological  action.  Decreased 
serum  chloride  and  sodium  were  attributed  to  polyuria,  however,  pharmacological  inhibition  of 
SGLT2 would be expected to decrease sodium reabsorption in the kidney. At higher doses and/or 
longer term exposures additional observations included increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 
plasma  alanine  aminotransferase  (ALT),  aspartate  aminotransferase  (AST),  triglycerides,  and 
ketonurea.  These  effects  are  consistent  with  secondary  responses  to  high  dose  pharmacology 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/137741/2014 
Page 18/99 
 
  
  
and  are  consistent  with  an  adaptive  metabolic  shift  towards  gluconeogenesis  and  fatty  acid 
metabolism. All clinical chemistry changes returned to control values during recovery periods.  
Exacerbation  of  spontaneously  occurring  renal  tubular  mineralization,  characterized  as  tubular, 
papillary and pelvic mineralization, was observed in the 13- and 26-week studies. In the 13-week 
study,  the  finding  was  observed  in  the  100  and  700  mg/kg/day  groups  and,  although  dose 
related in severity, it was considered non-adverse. After 4 weeks of treatment-free recovery, the 
mineralization  was  still increased  in  incidence  and  severity.  In  the  26-week  study,  non-adverse 
exacerbated  renal tubular  mineralization  was  observed  at  doses  >30  mg/kg/day,  and  persisted 
through the 3-month recovery period. In the rat carcinogenicity study similar findings were made 
at  all  dose  levels  (≥100  mg/kg)  and  in  addition  vacuolation  of  renal  cortical  tubular  cells  was 
seen.  The  Applicant  hypothesises  that  renal  mineralisation  is  a  consequence  of  a  rat-specific 
mechanism  related  to  intestinal  SGLT1  inhibition,  glucose  malabsorption,  decrease  of  intestinal 
pH,  increase  of  calcium  absorption,  increased  urinary  excretion  of  calcium  and  pelvic  and 
corticomedullary  nephrocalcinosis.  Based  on  the  apparent  change  in  calcium  and  phosphorus 
homeostasis, mineral deposits are likely calcium phosphate. In the 13 and 26-weeks studies, no 
bone  abnormalities  were  observed  and  in  the  parathyroid  only  a  low  incidence  of  hypertrophy 
was  seen,  which  was  similar  in  control  and  high  dose  animals.  Yet,  in  the  rat  carcinogenicity 
study  some  bone  abnormalities  were  observed  (increased  prominence  of  basophilic-staining 
residual  cartilage  in  the  cortical  bone  of  the  proximal  diaphysis  of  the  femur  and  increase  in 
trabecular  bone  in  the  sternum).  Urinary  calcium  and  markers  of  renal  damage  were  not 
assessed in the long-term studies, but were evaluated in a subsequent 7 day mechanistic toxicity 
study in rats. Based on these data and public data for other SGLT2 inhibitors, it was concluded 
that a calcium-driven mechanism for the renal tubular mineralisation is likely involved. Increased 
glomerular  reabsorption  of  phosphorus  is  suggested  to  contribute  as  well,  although  the  precise 
mechanism for the latter has not been shown.  
Other  rat  organs  having  non-adverse  responses  to  empagliflozin  treatment  include  pancreas, 
thyroid,  liver,  and  adrenals  and  were  typically  only  observed  in  the  26  week  study  and/or  the 
carcinogenicity  study.  Pancreatic  changes  in  rats  featured  occasionally  observed  vacuolation  of 
the  basilar  portion  of  cells  which  were  depleted  of  zymogen,  an  effect  considered  secondary  to 
the increased food consumption and decreased body weight.  
In  thyroid  glands,  minimal  follicular  cell  hypertrophy  was  observed  at  a  low  incidence  only  in 
males  and  the  Applicant  suggests  this  reflects  increased  activity.  The  cause  of  this  increased 
activity was not discussed. This effect on the thyroid seems not to be relevant for human, since it 
was minimal in severity and not observed in mice or dogs.  
In  the  rat  carcinogenicity  study  erosion/ulceration  of  the  stomach  was  noted.  The  cause  of  the 
stomach  erosions  in  the  rat  remains  obscure,  but  thus  far  it  seems  to  be  limited  to  the  rat 
carcinogenicity study.  
In both 13 and 26-weeks studies in rats there was a slight increase in liver weight in females in 
the  high  dose  group.  In  the  26-weeks  study  in  all  dose  groups  microvescicular  hepatocytic 
vacuolation was observed. These changes may reflect an adaptive response to the lower glucose 
availability. In both studies increases of AST and ALT were observed. However, the magnitude of 
these  increases  was  small  and  in  view  of  the  absence  of  a  histopathological  correlate  not 
considered  of  toxicological  relevance.  In  the  rat  carcinogenicity  study,  increased  vacuolation  of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/137741/2014

sinusoidal cells was seen in the absence of other pathological phenomena. Yet, in the 26-weeks 
study,  in  the  liver,  mild  multifocal  random  foci  of  hepatocellular  necrosis  were  noted  at  a  low 
incidence  (three  animals)  in  700  mg/kg/day  females  and  a  very  low  incidence  (one  animal)  in 
100 mg/kg/day females and hepatocellular eosinophilic globules were observed in treated males 
at  a  low  incidence  and  minimal  severity  in  the  30-  (two  animals)  and  100-  (one  animal) 
mg/kg/day dose groups. These changes were classified as being of uncertain nature.  
In the  adrenals, two test article-related microscopic changes were observed.  Vacuolation of the 
zona  glomerulosa  was  observed  in  males  and  females  from  all  dose  groups  ranging  in  severity 
from  minimal  to  moderate.  Considering  that  empagliflozin  will  reduce  sodium  reabsorption  by 
SGLT2  (and  SGLT1  (in  the  rat))  inhibition,  the  observed  effects  in  the  zona  glomerulosa  may 
reflect an adaptive response to reduced sodium levels triggering increased aldosterone synthesis. 
The second microscopic change, hypertrophy of the zona fasciculata, was observed in males and 
females  at  all  dose  levels.  The  etiology  of  these  effects  were  not  further  discussed  by  the 
Applicant,  but  may  reflect  an  adaptive  response  to  reduced  glucose  levels  triggering  increased 
glucocorticoid (cortisol) synthesis. 
In the rat carcinogenicity study, vessel mineralization was observed in the heart, tongue, kidney, 
eye, axillary and mesenteric lymph nodes, mandibular salivary gland and pancreas. In addition, 
tissue  mineralization  was  seen  in  seminal  vesicle,  glandular  stomach  muscularis  and  aorta. 
Mineralisation  predominantly  seen  in  males  and  for  some  tissues  (aorta,  tongue,  kidney, 
glandular  stomach  muscularis)  was  already  increased  at  the  low  dose.  Vascular  mineralization 
graded minimal to moderate varied from  small  subintimal foci to more extensive mineralization 
affecting the entire tunica media of some larger vessels. Although serum calcium and phosphorus 
levels were not measured in the carcinogenicity study, in the pathology report it is hypothesized 
that  it  is  likely  that  empagliflozin-related  hyperphosphatemia  (referring  to  the  6-months  repeat 
dose  toxicity  study  in  rats)  contributed  to  findings  of  systemic  vascular  and  soft  tissue 
mineralization. To explain the vascular and soft tissue mineralisation the Applicant points to the 
rat specific intestinal SGLT1  inhibition and subsequent increased calcium  absorption.  As long as 
electrolyte levels in patients are not affected, notably calcium and phosphate, it may be expected 
that  there  is  no  risk  for  humans.  However,  when  the  calcium  levels  and/or  phosphate  levels 
increase  in  patients,  e.g.  when  kidney  function  significantly  decreases,  soft  tissue  and  vascular 
mineralisation could be an issue for humans as well. 
Most changes observed during the dosing phases of the 13- and 26-week studies in rats resolved 
during the 4-week and 3-month recovery periods but exacerbation of renal tubular mineralization 
persisted in both studies as did the body weight gain decrement exhibited by high-dose females. 
As a carcinogenicity study does not contain a reversibility phase, it is not known whether vessel 
and tissue mineralisation was reversible. 
Repeat  dose  oral  toxicity  evaluations  in  dog  included  studies  of  2-,  4-,  13-,  26-,  and  52-week 
duration. In all studies except the 2-week dose range finding study, the doses were 10, 30, and 
100  mg/kg/day.  Similar  to  studies  in  the  rat,  there  was  a  largely  consistent  pattern  of 
observations  including  soft  stool/diarrhea,  decreased  body  weight  gain,  decreased  plasma 
glucose,  glucosuria  and  polyuria.  Unlike  the  rat,  however,  secondary  responses  to  glucose  loss 
indicative  of  shifts  in  metabolism  were  not  typically  observed.  Only  in  the  52-week  study  were 
changes  in  serum  electrolytes  apparent,  which  included  increases  in  serum  potassium  and 
decreases  in  serum  sodium  and  chloride  all  of  which  are  related  to  diarrhea  and  polyuria.

Increases  in  bone  specific  serum  alkaline  phosphatase  (ALP)  were  observed  but  these  were 
within  published  limits,  there  were  no  changes  in  serum  osteocalcin,  and  there  were  no 
histopathology findings in bone.  
Histologically,  the  kidney  was  the  single  consistent  target  organ  of  toxicity  of  empagliflozin. 
Interstitial  nephritis  and  tubular  nephropathy  were  observed  in  the  4-,  13-,  and  52-week  dog 
studies  almost  exclusively  in  the  high  dose  animals.  In  the  pathology  report  of  the  52-week 
study the lesions were  described as ranging from minimal  to mild  in severity and characterized 
by  the  presence  of  interstitial  infiltrates  of  mononuclear  leukocytes  with  variable  amounts  of 
collagen within the cortex and/or corticomedullary junction. Infiltrates expanded the interstitium 
to  separate  tubules  or  obscured  tubular  architecture.  These  areas  may  have  foci  of  increased 
interstitial collagen fibers (fibrosis). Tubules associated with the nephritis had a relative increase 
in cytoplasmic basophilia, an increased nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, decreased luminal diameter, 
or  variable  luminal  dilation  with  epithelial  flattening.  These  tubules  sometimes  showed 
degenerative  changes.  These  animals  also  demonstrated  a  minimal  to  moderate  cortical  tubule 
nephropathy  (5  males  and  2  females  of  the  100  mg/kg/day  dose  group),  which  was 
characterized  by  scattered  tubules  throughout  the  cortex  with  dilated  lumens  and  lined  with 
basophilic  epithelial  cells.  This  change  may  accompany  and  may  overlap  drug-related  foci  of 
chronic interstitial nephritis. The report states that this lesion was not observed after a 13-week 
recovery period in the 52-week study, but minimal mixed or mononuclear infiltrates were present 
in  the  cortex  in  both  high  dose  recovery  females.  Moreover,  interstitial  nephritis  was  not  fully 
recoverable in one dog of the 4-week study given a 8-week recovery period and was observed in 
one  male  of  the  13-week  study  after  a  13-week  recovery.  Renal  cortical  discoloration  was 
observed  in  0/6,  5/6,  6/6  and  6/6  animals  in  control,  low,  mid  and  high  dose  animals, 
respectively.  In  view  of  a  lack  of  histopathological  lesions  or  any  other  evidence  pointing to  an 
actual  effect  of  empagliflozin  on  renal  blood  flow,  it  was  concluded  that  the  latter  observations 
are likely not clinically relevant.  
In  the  liver  of  a  single  100  mg/kg/day  male  in  the  26-week  study,  centrilobular  degeneration 
characterized by microvesicular vacuolation of centrilobular hepatocytes was observed that may 
have  been  associated  with  loss  of  hepatocytes.  Also,  in  a  30  and  a 100  mg/kg/day  female  dog 
hepatocellular vacuolation was seen. In the pathology report the finding in the male is judged of 
being of uncertain nature, but the findings in the females are not discussed. In view of the small 
number of animals, these liver findings could be a signal of a treatment-related effect. In the 52-
week  study,  one  low  dose  animal  showed  panlobular,  hepatocellular  vacuolation  and  was 
characterized by one or more, round, punctate, clear macrovesicular vacuoles within hepatocytes 
of numerous hepatic lobules. 
In  the  52-week  study  there  was  an  increase  in  severity  from  minimal  to  moderate  of  adrenal 
zona  glomerulosa  vacuolation.  Possibly  these  changes  reflect  endocrine  reactions  to  the  long-
term change in electrolyte balance. 
In the same study one high dose animal showed testicular atrophy, a finding considered as being 
of  uncertain  nature.  In  the  4-weeks  study  reduction  of  testis  and  epididymis  weight  was 
observed in the high dose animals at the end of the recovery period. In the high dose males of 
the  2-weeks  and  the  26  weeks  study  small  prostrate  was  observed,  whereas  in  the  high  dose 
animals  from  the  13  weeks  study  and  the  mid  and  high  dose  animals  from  the  4  weeks  study 
glandular atrophy of the prostrate was seen. Considering the high dose levels in these animals, 
Assessment report

these  effects  where  possibly  related  to  weight  loss  and/or  emaciation  of  the  animals.  It  was 
considered non adverse as it was readily reversible during treatment-free recovery periods. Also 
in  view  of  the  high  exposure  multiples  at  these  dose  levels  these  findings  are  probably  not 
clinically relevant for patients. 
In  the  repeated  dose  toxicity  studies  in  rats  and  dogs,  empagliflozin-induced  effects  were 
generally  mild  at  the  low  dose  levels.  At  these  dose  levels  (rats  100  mg/kg/day,  dogs  10 
mg/kg/day)  exposure  multiples  were  10  and  18,  respectively.  Serious  toxicity  was  generally 
limited  to  the  high  dose  levels  where  exposure  multiples  were  sufficiently  in  excess  of  human 
therapeutic  exposure:  rats  35,  dogs  141-241.  Yet  in  the  carcinogenicity  studies  chronic  effects 
were  apparent  including  renal  pathology  in  rats  and  male  mice  and  vascular  and  soft  tissue 
mineralization  in  rats  that  already  appeared  at  the  lowest  dose  level.  For  these  chronic  effects 
safety margins were <17 in rats and <4.4 in mice. 
Genotoxicity 
The  genotoxic  potential  of  empagliflozin  was  investigated  in  a  bacterial  reverse  mutagenicity 
assay, an in vitro mammalian mutagenicity assay in L5178Y tk+/- Mouse Lymphoma cells and two 
in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus tests with a three day exposure period. All of these tests 
were  negative.  Based  on  these  data  it  is  concluded  that  empagliflozin  is  without  genotoxic 
potential. 
Carcinogenicity 
The  carcinogenic  potential  of  empagliflozin  was  studied  in  CD-1  mice  at  doses  of  100,  300  or 
1000  mg/kg/day  and  in  Wistar  (Han)  rats  at  doses  of  100,  300,  or  700  mg/kg/day.  At  the 
highest dose, systemic exposure attained a 45x and 62x multiple of human therapeutic exposure 
in  male  and  female  mice,  respectively,  and  in  rats  exposure  multiples  of  42x  and  72x  were 
achieved in the high dose males and females, respectively. Survival was decreased in male mice 
given  1000  mg/kg/day  resulting  in  early  termination  of  that  group  at  week  97.  Survival  was 
unaffected by treatment in other groups of mice and all groups of rats. 
There  were  no  tumors  observed  in  female  mice.  In  the  high  dose  males  (1000  mg/kg/day),  5 
renal  tumors  (3  adenomas  and  2  carcinomas)  were  observed.  Atypical  hyperplasia  was  only 
observed  in  the  high  dose  males.  A  wider  spectrum  of  changes,  including  tubular  hypertrophy, 
karyomegaly and cystic hyperplasia was seen in the lower dose groups in a dose-related manner. 
When  these  changes  are  seen  as  a  continuum  ranging  from  adaptive  responses  to  the 
pharmacological  action of empagliflozin to  neoplastic changes leading to tumour  formation,  it  is 
difficult  draw  the  line  where  neoplastic  transformation  starts.  The  Applicant  provided  additional 
mechanistic studies to resolve the mode of action for renal tumors in CD-1 mice.  
The  weight  of  evidence  on  the  absence  of  genotoxicity,  gender  and  apparent  mouse  strain 
specificity,  and 
the  dose  response  and 
temporal  relationships  of  chronic  sustained 
degenerative/regenerative  changes  with  renal  neoplasms  is  consistent  with  a  non-genotoxic 
mode-of-action.  Both  literature  evidence  and  study  data  support  a  necessary  but  not  sufficient 
mode-of-action role of predisposing pro-proliferative factors supported by background cystogenic 
changes in the CD-1 mouse strain (key event 1) and non-gender specific renal stress associated 
with  the  expected  pharmacology  (key  event  2).  These  events  turn  out  to  be  procystogenic  but 
are not sufficient to cause tumors, which is evident from the lack of tumors in CD1 female mice

and  rats.  Chronic  empagliflozin  treatment  in  male  mice  results  in  additional  and  accelerated 
compound-related  renal  injury  (key  event  3)  on  top  of  key  events  1  and  2,  facilitated  by 
exposure  to  cytotoxic  4-OH  CTA  generated  from  the  unstable  male-mouse  predominant  renal 
metabolite  M466/2.  Key  event  4  is  supported  by  study  data  showing  more  pronounced  cystic 
tubular changes in CD-1 male mice with age and chronic empagliflozin treatment, and literature 
evidence suggesting impaired reserve capacity/injury susceptibility in aging rodents. Key event 5 
is  supported  by  study  data  showing  the  high  co-occurrence  of  atypical  hyperplasia  and  renal 
neoplasms in high dose male mice with chronic degenerative/regenerative renal tubular changes, 
and  literature  evidence  suggesting  an  influencing  or  promoting  role  for  renal  tubular 
injury/tumors with the co-occurrence of similar cystogenic changes in rodents. 
While  the  single  renal  tubular  adenoma  in  a  male  mouse  given  300  mg/kg/day  cannot  be 
definitively dissociated from empagliflozin treatment, there were several reasons why this tumor 
is  not  considered  empagliflozin-related.  The  occurrence  of  this  single  neoplasm  was  not 
statistically significant and the incidence (1 of 50 animals; 2%) was within the historical control 
range  (0.0-2.9%)  for  renal  tubular  adenomas  of  the  test  facility  and  supplier  (from  studies 
performed  between  2002  and  2006).  Furthermore,  the  kidneys  of  this  animal  either  lacked 
degenerative  and  proliferative  findings  (cysts,  karyomegaly  and  tubular  atrophy)  or  harbored  a 
severity  similar  to  controls  (CPN  and  tubular  hypertrophy)  when  compared  to  that  which  was 
associated  with  empagliflozin-related  renal  tubular  neoplasms  in  males  given  1000  mg/kg/day. 
Although cystic hyperplasia was observed in this animal, the grade was slight and there was no 
karyomegaly or tubular atrophy, which was generally associated with the renal tumors observed 
in  the  1000  mg/kg/day  male  dose  group.  In  the  13-week  mouse  study,  degenerative  changes 
(karyomegaly,  single  cell  necrosis  and  cystic  hyperplasia)  detected  in  the  500  mg/kg/day  dose 
group  were  not  accompanied  by  increased  tubule  cell  proliferation  as  evidenced  by  a  lack  of 
increased  Ki-67  staining  at  this  dose  level.  This  indicates  that  a  threshold  dose  of  >500 
mg/kg/day  is  required  to  produce  a  level  of  tubular  degeneration  that  results  in  a  proliferative 
regenerative  response.  Furthermore,  the  preneoplastic  precursor  lesion  of  renal  tubular 
adenomas,  atypical  hyperplasia,  was  not  detected  in  males  in  the  300  mg/kg/day  dose  group. 
For  these  reasons  the  single  renal  tubular  adenoma  in  the  300  mg/kg/day  was  not  considered 
empagliflozin-related. 
Thus  the  300  mg/kg  dose  can  be  considered  the  NOAEL  for  empagliflozin-induced  tumor 
formation, which provides as safety margin based on systemic exposure of 11. 
In male rats given 700 mg/kg/day, a statistically significant increased incidence (18%) of benign 
vascular  tumors  (hemangiomas)  in  the  mesenteric  lymph  node  was  observed.  The  lack  of 
genotoxic  activity  of  empagliflozin,  the  well-established  high  background  incidence  of 
hemangioma of the mesenteric lymph node in Wistar (Han) rats, the specific susceptibility of the 
male rat to these tumors, the extreme rarity of hemangiomas arising in lymph nodes in humans, 
the  presence  of  lymph  node  findings  (sinus  histiocytosis,  pigmented  macrophages,  mast  cells 
and/or  sinus  erythrocytes)  in  the  rat  carcinogenicity  study  consistent  with  known  or  proposed 
epigenetic  mechanisms  for  the  vascular  tumors  (vascular  obstruction,  chronic  antigenic 
stimulation  and  increased  hemolysis,  hemosiderosis  and  iron  overload),  and  the  absence  of 
vascular  neoplasms  in  any  other  species  following  empagliflozin  administration  suggest  a  low 
relevance of this finding to human safety. The exposure multiple to the dose of 300 mg/kg/day 
at which the finding was not considered empagliflozin-related is 26x relative to the steady state 
Assessment report

exposure in clinical trials at 25 mg/day. Taken together the increased incidence of hemangioma 
of the mesenteric lymph node in male rats of the 700 mg/kg/day dose group is a finding that is 
considered  of  low  relevance  to  human  safety  and  is  not  considered  to  materially  influence  the 
benefit/risk assessment of empagliflozin. 
Also in males, a statistically increased incidence of benign interstitial (Leydig) cell tumors of the 
testes of 14% and 12% was observed in males given 300 or 700 mg/kg/day, respectively. It is 
currently  uncertain  which  mechanism  leads  to  these  tumours.  Yet,  in  view  of  the  minimal 
increase in incidence and the acceptable safety margin of 18 at the low dose level these tumours 
are likely of little relevance for humans. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Male  and  female  fertility  and  early  embryonic  development  were  not  affected  in  rats  up  to  700 
mg/kg/day.  
Empagliflozin did not show teratogenic potential in the embryofetal developmental studies in rats 
or rabbits up to 700 mg/kg. Effects on foetuses were limited to a few foetuses with bent limbs in 
rats and post-implantation loss attributable to complete litter loss in one rabbit, both occurring at 
the highest maternally toxic dose level. 
In the pre- and postnatal toxicity study in rats empagliflozin caused a minimal transient decrease 
in  body  weight  gain  that  did  not  result  in  any  lasting  deficits  in  development,  learning  or 
memory.  starting  at  a  dose  level  of  30  mg/kg.  At  the  NOAEL  of  10  mg/kg/day,  the  systemic 
exposure  of  the  dams  was  comparable  to  human  exposure  at  the  anticipated  therapeutic  dose 
(safety  margin  is  1).  Although  empagliflozin  is  transferred  via  the  placenta,  the  levels  are 
considered very low. Exposure via the milk is considered a possibility. However, in the pre- and 
postnatal  developmental  toxicology  study  in  rats,  plasma  levels  of  empagliflozin  measured  on 
postnatal  day  18  in  pups  born  to  dams  treated  with  up  to  100  mg/kg/day  from  GD  6  through 
lactation  day  20  were  all  below  limits  of  quantitation.  The  Applicant  states  that  there  was  no 
change  in  the  composition  of  the  milk.  However,  only  protein,  lactose  and  glucose  were 
measured.  Glucose  could  not  be  detected  in  any  sample,  including  the  samples  from  control 
animals.  The  transient  effects  on  body  weight  probably  were  a  consequence  of  the 
pharmacological  action  of  empagliflozin.  The  statistically  significant  deficit  in  learning  and 
memory observed in male pups born to dams of the 100 mg/kg/day group was only observed at 
PND21.  At  PND62  no  deficit  was  apparent.  This  indicates  no  irreversible  functional  loss  in 
learning and memory had occurred. 
Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance  of empagliflozin was assessed in  a dermal sensitization test in mice  and dermal 
and ocular irritation tests in rabbits and was found to be negative in all tests. 
Other toxicity studies 
The weight of evidence demonstrates that empagliflozin is not  immunotoxic in the species used 
in  the  preclinical  studies  and  therefore  is  not  considered  to  have  an  immunotoxic  potential  in 
humans under the conditions of therapeutic use.

Based on the calculations provided by the Applicant, the human to animal safety margin at the 
proposed impurity specifications would be 6, 42 and 17, respectively. When a similar calculation 
is made, but based on qualification in the 4-week, 13-week and 13-week studies in dogs, instead 
of rats, the safety margins would be 2, 14 and 6. Thus for both species, the proposed impurity 
specifications provide safety margins in excess of unity.  
The specified impurities were tested for genotoxic properties in bacterial reverse mutation assay 
and in vitro micronucleus assay in CHO cells. All tests provided negative results. 
Concerning the lack of structural alerts of any potential impurities, the Applicant provided an  in 
silico assessment report, which revealed no structural alerts for genotoxicity. 
Combination  toxicology  studies  were  undertaken  by  the  Applicant  to  support  clinical  trials  for 
fixed  dose  combinations  of  empagliflozin  and  metformin  or  linagliptin.  Such  fixed  dose 
combinations are not the subject of this MAA. However, once marketed, combination therapy of 
diabetes  patients  with  empagliflozin  and  other  antidiabetic  medication  might  be  considered. 
Therefore  these  studies  were  briefly  reviewed  based  on  summary  information  provided  by  the 
Applicant. 
The  combination  of  empagliflozin  with  metformin  did  not  affect  the  pharmacokinetics  of 
empagliflozin.  No  new  toxicities  were  revealed.  However,  when  combined  with  metformin,  the 
NOAEL  in  rats  was  reduced  as  compared  to  empagliflozin  administration  alone,  reflecting  a 
greater sensitivity to empagliflozin toxicity in the presence of metformin. Although not discussed 
by the Applicant, one possibility for this greater sensitivity might be a greater reduction of blood 
glucose levels in the presence of metformin. 
When  linagliptin  and  empagliflozin  were  combined  at  high  dose  levels  a  drug-drug  interaction 
was  observed  as  the  co-administration  of  linagliptin  increased  the  exposure  to  empagliflozin 
whereas empagliflozin decreased the systemic exposure to linagliptin when dosed concomitantly. 
Again no new toxicities were revealed, however, liver effects appeared to be more prominent  in 
the presence of linagliptin. 
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Based on the outcome of the OECD 107 log Kow determination, empagliflozin is not expected to 
be PBT or vPvB. 
PECsw  is  0.125  µg/L,  which  exceeds  the  action  limit  of  0.01  µg/L.  A  Phase  II  assessment  is 
warranted. 
Based  on  the  results  of  the  PEC/PNEC  calculations  in  the  phase  II  Tier  A  environmental  risk 
assessment,  no  unacceptable  adverse  effects  for  the  surfacewater,  groundwater  and  STP 
compartment are expected from empagliflozin. 
However,  the  dossier  is  incomplete.  Based  on  the  total  residue  approach,  significant  shifting  to 
sediment is observed in the OECD 308 study. Therefore, the environmental risks of empagliflozin 
to  the  sediment  compartment  should  be  assessed.  The  applicant  is  requested  to  calculate  a 
PECsediment,  perform  a  toxicity  study  on  a  sediment  dwelling  organism  (Hyalella  sp., 
Lumbriculus  sp.  or  Chironomus  sp.),  and  compare  the  PEC  and  PNEC  for  the  sediment 
compartment.

As a result of the above considerations, the available data do not allow to conclude definitively on 
the potential risk of empagliflozin to the environment.

The  most  prominent  target  organ  in  toxicity  studies  in  mice,  rats  and  dogs  is  the  kidney, 
although  the  observed  effects  differ  to  some  extent  between  the  species.  In  the  mouse  at  all 
dose  levels  renal  tubular  dilatation  occurs,  which  is  considered  a  consequence  of  the 
pharmacology  of  empagliflozin.  At  higher  dose  levels  this  leads  to  cyst  formation  and  the  high 
dose  animals  show  tubular  adenomas  and  carcinomas  in  the  carcinogenicity  study.  A  mode  of 
action  for  empagliflozin-associated  male  mouse  renal  tumors  involving  diminished  oxidative

pharmacology related renal stress, additional compound related renal metabolic stress involving 
a  male  mouse-predominant  renal  metabolite,  accelerated  depletion  of  renal  stress  reserve  and 
conversion  to  constitutive  proliferative  phenotype  is  proposed.  A  systematic  approach  for 
analyzing the relevance of a cancer mode of action for humans was employed and the weight of 
evidence on the absence of genotoxicity, gender and apparent mouse strain specificity, and the 
dose  response  and  temporal  relationships  of  chronic  sustained  degenerative/regenerative 
changes  with  renal  neoplasms  is  consistent  with  a  non-genotoxic  mode-of-action  of  which  the 
relevance for humans is currently unknown. The 300 mg/kg dose can be considered the NOAEL 
for  empagliflozin-induced  tumor  formation,  which  provides  as  safety  margin  based  on  systemic 
exposure  of  11.  Pharmacology  related  renal  stress  occurring  at  all  dose  levels  is  not  species 
specific and could  be  relevant for humans as  well.  It  is therefore important that renal function, 
especially where related to renal tubular integrity, is followed up clinically. 
In  the  rat  tubular  mineralisation  occurs  at  all  dose  levels  and  vascular  and  soft  tissue

of  residual  cartilage  in  the  femur  were  observed.  Disturbance  of  calcium  homeostasis  is 
suggested to be the main contributory factor leading to mineral deposition and bone changes.  
Various hepatic changes were seen in the non-clinical studies. No clear pattern was observed. In 
mice  and  rats  increased  liver  weight  was  observed.  In  mice  hydropic  changes  (13-week  study) 
and  hepatocytic  cytoplasmic  vacuolation  (carcinogenicity  study)  were  seen.  In  rats, 
microvescicular  hepatocytic  vacuolation  was  observed  and  incidentally,  mild  multifocal  random 
foci of hepatocellular necrosis and hepatocellular eosinophilic globules were seen in the repeated 
dose  toxicity  studies,  but  in  the  carcinogenicity  study  vacuolation  of  sinusoidal  cells  was  seen. 
Mild increases in ALT and AST were seen in rats and dogs. In dogs, hypertrophy of Kuppfer cells 
was  observed.  In  addition,  centrilobular  degeneration  characterised  by  microvescicular 
vacuolation  of  centrilobular  hepatocytes  was  seen  in  a  single  animal  and  in  another  animal 
panlobular  hepatocellular  macrovescicular  vacuolation  was  observed.  Finally  in  the  combination 
toxicology  study  with  empagliflozin  and  linagliptin,  liver  effects  appear  more  prominent.  As  no 
further  in  depth  toxicological  investigations  have  been  undertaken  to  determine  the  precise 
nature of the vacuolation or the cause of AST/ALT elevations and sporadic incidence of necrosis, 
it is premature to conclude that there would be no risk for adverse liver events in patients. It is 
therefore agreed that liver safety is followed up in long-term clinical studies and included as an 
important potential risk in the RMP. Yet, it can be accepted that currently no further non-clinical 
mechanistic studies are undertaken. 
2.3.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology studies in vitro and in animal models have shown that empagliflozin is a selective 
SGLT2 inhibitor reducing blood glucose levels by diminishing reabsorption of glucose in the renal 
tubuli. 
The  provided  pharmacokinetic  studies  indicate  that  the  chosen  species  were  adequate  for  the 
toxicology studies. Besides a few omissions, the pharmacokinetics have been sufficiently studied.

3    Trial 1245.33 was conducted in patients with basal insulin as background therapy. This trial was originally designated 
as a phase IIb trial. Since it had confirmatory testing introduced via a protocol amendment, it is considered to be 
equivalent to a confirmatory phase III trial for the assessment of the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin 
3    Minimum duration at time of interim analysis; overall anticipated duration is between 6 and 8 years 
5    Data from a combined analysis with the preceding double-blind preceding trials 1245.9 and 1245.10 are presented 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
During drug development three formulations were used: 
The formulation TF-I was developed in the dose strengths of 0.5 mg, 5 mg, 25 mg and 100 mg. 
Formulation  TF-II  was developed for  Phase  II clinical  studies based on TF-I  as this formulation 
provided the desired systemic exposure and stability. The qualitative composition of TF-II is the 
same  as  for  TF-I  but  differ  in  the  quantitative  composition.  The  final  formulation  25  mg  FF 
contained  in  the  tablet  core  the  same  excipients  as  TF-II  with  an  optimized  quantitative 
composition. The 10 mg formulation has a composition different from the 25 mg tablets. 
Specific and high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) 
methods for the quantification of empagliflozin and its metabolite were developed and validated 
for human urine and plasma to support the clinical empagliflozin development program. Initially, 
the assays were developed for empagliflozin and its metabolite and they were later modified for 
the determination of empagliflozin only. 
Population Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic Modelling 
The  applicant  performed  a  Population  pharmacokinetic  and  pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic 
modelling of empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
Pharmacokinetic Results 
The demographic covariates (BMI, age, gender, and race) as well as TPRO had a significant, but 
small  impact  on  empagliflozin's  CL/F  and  AUC,ss,  respectively.  The  typical  AUC,ss  values  were 
generally within ±25% of a reference patient and thus were considered as not clinically relevant. 
Furthermore,  the  apparent  oral  clearance  of  empagliflozin  decreased  with  a  decrease  in  eGFR 
leading to an increase in drug exposure. The typical AUC,ss increased by 18.5% (95% CI: 13.0, 
24.8), 49.2% (95% CI: 39.2, 60.6), 88.1% (95% CI: 69.9, 107) in patients with an eGFR of 60, 
30, and 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively, compared to a reference patient with a eGFR of 100 
mL/min/1.73 m2. Other covariates tested included smoking status and liver enzymes (LDH, AST, 
ALT,  and  AP)  did  not  have  a  significant  effect  on  the  PK  of  empagliflozin.  These  results  are 
further elaborated and commented upon with the respective headers in this report. 
Absorption  
The  Applicant  did  not  provide  an  absolute  bioavailability  study  in  which  a  comparison  of  the 
exposure to empagliflozin is compared between an intravenous dose and an oral dose. 
However,  in  the  mass-balance  study  54%  of  the  radioactivity  administered  orally  was  found  in 
the urine and about 7% in the faeces as metabolites. It can therefore be assumed that at least 
60% of the dose is absorbed with oral solution.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/137741/2014 
Page 29/99 
 
  
  
  
The  provided  data  indicates  that  the  final  25  mg  formulation  can  be  considered  bioequivalent 
with the trial formulation TF-II which is used in the pivotal pharmacokinetic studies. However, in 
some phase I studies also the trial formulation TF-I was used. As the quantitative composition of 
this formulation differ substantially from the final formulation (FF) as well as from the other trial 
formulation FT-II, comparison of the results with this first formulation is difficult to make as no 
comparative  bioavailability  study  was  submitted.  As  stated  by  Applicant  empagliflozin  can  be 
considered  as  a  BCS  Class  III  drug,  a  biowaiver  for  this  formulation  can  be  granted  as  this 
formulation was only used in three non-pivotal studies. The submitted studies demonstrate that 
food  significantly  affect  the  bioavailability  of  empagliflozin.  The  extent  of  exposure  (AUC)  is 
decreased by 16% and the  peak levels  Cmax  by more than  37%. The differences  are  considered 
not clinical relevant. 
In  study  1245.79,  the  10  mg  formulation  was  shown  to  be  bioequivalent  with  the  25  mg 
formulation  under  fasting  conditions.  The  90%  confidence  intervals  for  the  extent  and  rate  of 
absorption were, after dose correction, within the acceptance ranges of 0.80 - 1.25. 
Distribution 
Empagliflozin  is  rapidly  absorbed  following  oral  administration  with  a  mean  tmax  of  0.938  h  in 
plasma. After  reaching peak levels, plasma concentrations declined in  a biphasic fashion  with  a 
rapid  distribution  phase  and  a  slower  elimination  phase.  The  apparent  steady-state  volume  of 
distribution  was  73.8  L.  The  apparent  terminal  elimination  half-life  of  empagliflozin  was  12.4 
hours, and the apparent oral clearance was 10.6 L/h.  
The protein binding in human plasma is about 86% and the distribution to red blood cell 37% of 
the plasma concentration. 
In the figure below a typical concentration-time curve of empagliflozin upon oral administration 
of 10, 25 mg, and 100 mg are given.

EMA/CHMP/137741/2014 
Page 30/99 
 
  
  
 
Elimination 
Excretion 
Of  the  total  radioactivity  orally  administered  54%  was  recovered  in  the  urine  and  41%  in  the 
faeces. 
In  urine  28.6%  of  the  dose  is  excreted  unchanged  in  the  urine.  In  faeces,  unchanged 
empagliflozin was found to represent 82.9% of faecal radioactivity (34.1% of radioactive dose). 
The remaining faecal radioactivity was accounted for primarily by three metabolites, all of which 
were also observed in plasma. 
Metabolism 
In  humans,  unchanged  empagliflozin  is  the  most  abundant  drug-related  component  in  plasma 
(75.5 - 77.4% of total radioactivity). A total of six metabolites of empagliflozin were detected in 
plasma. However, none are considered as major metabolites as the proportion of each metabolite 
was  less  than  10%  of  total  drug-related  exposure.  Empagliflozin  biotransformation  primarily 
involved  glucuronidation,  and  to  a  lesser  extent  oxidation.  As  such,  the  most  abundant 
metabolites  of  empagliflozin  were  three  glucuronide  conjugates  (3.3  -  7.4%  of  plasma 
radioactivity). 
In  urine  only  small  amounts  of  this  metabolite  could  be  detected  after  oral  administration  of 
empagliflozin. As the metabolites do not contribute to the clinical efficacy and safety, the lack of 
further information on the pharmacokinetics of these metabolites is acceptable. 
No  information  on  possible  genetic  polymorphism  was  discussed  by  the  Applicant  as  the 
metabolites  formed  by  enzymes  with  are  subjected  to  polymorphism  (e.g.  UGT1A1)  are  only 
formed in small quantities.  
Empagliflozin  exposure  increased  in  a  more  or  less  dose  proportional  way  over  the  dose  range 
0.5 mg to 800 mg following single oral administration to healthy volunteers. Cmax was near dose 
proportional from 0.5 to 800 mg. Paired comparisons of dose groups indicated that increases in 
Cmax  were  dose  proportional  from  0.5  to  400  mg  and  slightly  less  than  dose  proportional  from 
400 to 800 mg. 
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of empagliflozin were similar after multiple dosing at steady-
state  compared 
to  single  dose  suggesting 
that  empagliflozin  demonstrates 
linear 
pharmacokinetics. 
As  the  proposed  dose  is  only  25  mg,  the  deviation  from  linearity  in  the  higher  range  is 
considered of no clinical relevance. 
As  no  unexpected  accumulation  occur  after  multiple  doing  of  empagliflozin,  time  dependent 
changes in the pharmacokinetics are unlikely to occur. 
Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
The  exposure  of  empagliflozin  in  T2DM  patients  do  not  differ  in  a  clinical  significant  way  from 
healthy  subjects.  By  comparing  the  pharmacokinetic  variables  after  single  dose  in  healthy 
subjects from with those of T2DM patients a slightly higher exposure was found in T2DM patients 
(see  Table  below).  These  exposure  differences  are  marginal  and  as  empagliflozin  also  shows 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/137741/2014 
Page 31/99 
 
  
  
linear pharmacokinetics in both healthy volunteers and patients with T2DM, the observed minor 
differences  in  empagliflozin  exposure  are  not  expected  to  confine  the  applicability  of  healthy 
volunteer trial results to the patient population. 
Special populations 
The extent of exposure (AUC) is affected by renal insufficiency. In mild and moderate impairment 
the exposure is increased by 20% and in patients with severe impairment by 66%. Also the half-
life is increased in severe renal impaired patients in comparison with normal renal functions. 
This  increase  in  exposure is  mainly  caused  by  a  decrease  in  renal  clearance  of  empagliflozin  in 
these patients. As the active site of action of empagliflozin is the renal tubuli, the efficacy will be 
probably decreased in these  patients as  the glucose in urine is these patients is also decreased 
significantly.  
This  higher  exposure  and  lower  glucose  excretion  in  patients  with  mild  and  moderate  renal 
impairment may be considered of no clinical relevance. This is based on the data of the Phase III 
study 1245.36 from which the Applicant claims that patients with moderate renal impairment did 
show a positive B/R ratio. 
The relationship between renal impairment and the exposure is shown in the figure below. 
Liver impairment affects the exposure of empagliflozin significantly. The overall exposure (AUC) 
increased by 75% in severe liver impaired  patients in comparison  with healthy subjects. This is 
not due to renal insufficiency, which may be also manifest in patients with liver impairment, as 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/137741/2014 
Page 32/99 
 
  
  
 
 
the  amount  excreted  in  urine  is  increased  slightly  also.  No  dose  adjustment  is  considered 
necessary in these patients.  
The  exposure  to  empagliflozin  in  Japanese  and  Chinese  subjects  is  significant  higher  after 
multiple dosing of 25 mg orally than in Caucasian subjects. This may be due to differences in the 
weight as exposure to empagliflozin appeared to decreases with weight. 
The  slight  increase  in  exposure  in  patients  over  65  years  may  be  explained  by  a  lesser  renal 
function  in  these  group  of  patients  as  renal  impairment  clearly  affects  the  exposure  to 
empagliflozin. It is therefore acceptable not to adjust the dose on the basis of age but more on 
the renal function. 
Weight and gender does not have clinically significant effect on the exposure of empagliflozin. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Potential drug-drug interactions of empagliflozin have been investigated in a number of phase I 
trials. The test substances were selected based on the properties of empagliflozin or as important 
and frequently prescribed co-medications in the target population. 
Empagliflozin  pharmacokinetics  were  similar  with  and  without  co-administration  of  metformin, 
glimepiride,  pioglitazone,  sitagliptin,  linagliptin,  warfarin,  verapamil,  ramipril,  simvastatin, 
hydrochlorothiazide, and torasemide. Overall exposure (AUC) of empagliflozin increased 1.6-fold 
following  co-administration  with  gemfibrozil,  1.35-fold  with  rifampicin,  and  1.5-fold  with 
probenecid. The observed increases in the overall exposure of empagliflozin were not considered 
to be clinically significant. 
No  dosage  adjustment  of  empagliflozin  is  recommended  when  it  is  administered  concomitantly 
with gemfibrozil, rifampicin, or probenecid. Therefore interaction on the level of the transporters 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1 and OAT3 are considered not clinical relevant. 
Empagliflozin  had  no  clinically  meaningful  effect  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  metformin, 
glimepiride,  pioglitazone,  sitagliptin, 
linagliptin,  warfarin,  digoxin,  ramipril,  simvastatin, 
hydrochlorothiazide, torasemide, and oral contraceptives when co-administered with any of these 
drugs. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The  pharmacodynamics  profile  of  empagliflozin  has  been  characterised  based  on  the  results  of 
ten clinical pharmacology studies, including one QT study. 
Mechanism of action 
The kidney has a role in the regulation of blood glucose levels. Therefore the kidney can serve as 
a  target  for  antidiabetic  therapy.  The  sodium-dependent  glucose  co-transporter-2  (SGLT-2)  is 
localized  in  the  renal  proximal  tubules,  accounting  for  approximately  90%  of  renal  glucose 
reabsorption. It reabsorbs most of the ~ 180 g glucose filtered under normal conditions through 
the  glomeruli  per  day.  SGLT-2  inhibition  decreases  renal  glucose  reabsorption,  promotes 
glycosuria and results in reduced levels of blood glucose. Empagliflozin selectively inhibits SGLT-
2 in the kidney, resulting in direct, insulin-independent, elimination of glucose by the kidney.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
The urinary glucose  excretion (UGE) is the  main  parameter assessed in  the investigation of the 
pharmacodynamic profile of empagliflozin. The choice of urinary glucose excretion (UGE) as the 
main parameter in the investigation of the pharmacodynamics of empagliflozin is acceptable and 
crucial  in  view  of  its  claimed  mechanism  of  action.  UGE  has  been  assessed  in  three  trials  in 
healthy volunteers and in five trials in subjects with T2DM. 
From the three trials in healthy subjects it is concluded that oral administration of empagliflozin 
resulted  in  a  dose-dependent  increase  in  UGE.  In  healthy  volunteers,  UGE  was  higher  with  all 
doses  (0.5  mg  to  800  mg)  compared  with  placebo  (see  figure).  Following  a  single  oral 
administration  of  empagliflozin,  up  to  91  g  of  glucose  was  excreted  in  urine.  Empagliflozin 
inhibited  reabsorption  of  <40%  of  filtered  glucose  with  single  daily  doses  up  to  10  mg  and 
approximately 40–60% of filtered glucose at higher doses, with the effect reaching a plateau at 
around the 100 mg dose. At doses less than 50 mg, the majority of glucose was excreted in the 
first 24 h, but at doses of 100 mg and above, glucose excretion continued for up to 48–72 h. The 
time  to  reach  the  maximum  rate  of  UGE  was  7  h  in  most  subjects  and  was  similar  in  all  dose 
groups.  
It  is  concluded  that  empagliflozin  can  induce  sustained,  dose-dependent  glycosuria  in  healthy 
subjects.  
Figure  PD01  Mean  cumulative  amounts  of  glucose  excreted  in  urine  following 
administration  of  single  oral  doses  of  0.5  mg  to  800  mg  empagliflozin  in  healthy 
volunteers 
In Caucasian, Japanese and Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes administration of empagliflozin 
results  in  a  dose-dependent  increase  in  urinary  glucose  excretion.  UGE  increases  immediately 
following the first dose  of empagliflozin, is observed  over the entire 24-h  dosing interval  and  is 
maintained at the end of a 4-week treatment period. It averages at about 78 g/day with 25 mg 
empagliflozin  once  daily.  A  plateau  appears  to  be  reached  at  the  10  mg  dose  of  empagliflozin 
once  daily.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  rates  of  UGE  in  the  empagliflozin  10  mg  and  25  mg 
groups  were  similar.  Increased  UGE  with  empagliflozin  treatment  does  not  result  in  marked 
increases of urine volume. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/137741/2014 
Page 34/99 
 
  
  
 
In healthy volunteers empagliflozin does not have any effect on plasma glucose levels despite of 
increased glycosuria.  However in  patients  with  T2DM empagliflozin  reduces  plasma glucose in a 
more  or  less  dose  dependent  fashion.  However  the  differences  between  10  and  25  mg  are  not 
significant. 
With  empagliflozin,  cumulative  amounts  of  glucose  in  urine  decrease  with  renal  impairment. 
However due to limited data the impact of lowered glomerular filtration rate on plasma glucose in 
T2DM as well as the safety aspects are further assessed in clinical studies. 
In  patient  with  hepatic  impairment  UGE  was  not  affected;  it  was  similar  in  subjects  with  liver 
impairment and subjects with normal hepatic function. 
No effect of empagliflozin on serum insulin was observed during 8-day treatment of patients with 
T2DM  with  empagliflozin.  Insulin  AUEC  and  Emax  were  similar  with  and  without  empagliflozin 
treatment at all dose levels. However, after 24 weeks of treatment with empagliflozin (10 and 25 
mg  doses)  reductions  from  baseline  compared  with  placebo  are  observed  for  fasting  plasma 
insulin.  Following  treatment  with  empagliflozin  reductions  in  plasma  levels  of  1,5-AG  are 
observed  in  T2DM  reflecting  the  effect  on  glucose  levels.  Fructosamine  levels  decreased. 
However,  the  observed  changes  were  not  significantly  different  from  placebo.  There  were  no 
consistent trends in changes observed in glucagon levels with empagliflozin treatment.  
Secondary pharmacology 
Effects of empagliflozin on QT interval were investigated in Trial 1245.6. A total of 30 male and 
female  subjects  were  randomised  to  receive  25  mg  empagliflozin  (therapeutic  dose),  200  mg 
empagliflozin  (supratherapeutic  dose),  400  mg  moxifloxacin  (positive  control),  or  2  times 
placebo. Single oral doses of 25 mg (therapeutic) and 200 mg empagliflozin (supra-therapeutic) 
in healthy subjects are not associated with prolongation of the QT interval. The primary endpoint 
was mean change from baseline (MCfB) in the population heart rate-corrected QT interval (QTcN) 
between 1–4 h after dosing. The placebo-corrected adjusted mean change from baseline in QTcN 
within  the  time  interval  1  –  4  h  after  dosing  was  0.59  ms  (90%  CI:  -0.69,  1.87)  for  25  mg 
empagliflozin  and  -0.22  ms  (90%  CI:  -1.39,  0.94)  for  200  mg  empagliflozin.  The  difference  in 
the mean QTcN change from baseline between 2 h and 4 h after administration of moxifloxacin 
vs. placebo was 12.42 ms with a lower 90% CI of 10.7 ms clearly above zero. Also the analysis 
of the primary endpoint by gender and analyses of secondary endpoints indicated the absence of 
a  clinically  relevant  increase  from  baseline  in  the  mean  QTcN  interval.  It  is  concluded  that 
empagliflozin has no effect on QT-interval. 
Genetic differences in PD response 
In  healthy  subjects  and  in  Caucasian,  Japanese  and  Chinese  patients  with  type  2  diabetes 
administration of empagliflozin results in a dose-dependent increase in urinary glucose excretion 
(UGE). UGE increases immediately following the first dose of empagliflozin, is observed over the 
entire  24-h  dosing  interval  and  is  maintained  at  the  end  of  a  4-week  treatment  period.  It 
averages  at  about  78  g/day  with  25  mg  empagliflozin  once  daily.  A  plateau  appears  to  be 
reached  at  the  10  mg  dose  of  empagliflozin  once  daily.  There  are  no  differences  between 
Japanese, Chinese and Caucasian subjects. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/137741/2014

In healthy Caucasian and Japanese subjects empagliflozin does not influence plasma glucose. In 
Japanese  and  Chinese  patients  with  type  2  diabetes  as  well  as  in  Caucasian  patients 
administration of empagliflozin reduces plasma glucose. 
There  are  no  arguments  to  conclude  genetic  differences  between  Caucasian,  Japanese  and 
Chinese subjects concerning serum insulin, 1,5-Anhydroglucitol, fructosamine or glucagon during 
administration of empagliflozin. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
In  general,  the  pharmacokinetics  of  empagliflozin  are  well  established  and  the  pharmacokinetic 
variables  with  respect  to  absorption,  distribution,  excretion  and  metabolism  do  not  give  rise  to 
unforeseen problems with this product. 
The  increased  systemic  exposure  of  empagliflozin  in  patients  with  moderate  or  severe  renal 
impairment,  the  decreased  empagliflozin  and  glucose  excretion  in  urine  in  these  patients  is 
discussed further within the clinical context (see below).  
The significant increase in exposure in patients with severe hepatic impairment may influence the 
Benefit/Risk  of  these  patients  in  a  negative  sense.  The  impact  of  liver  impairment  on  plasma 
glucose  in  T2DM  as  well  as  the  safety  aspects  are  further  assessed  in  phase  III  studies  (see 
below). Patients with T2DM did show similar exposure as healthy volunteers. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The  pharmacodynamics  of  the  compound  have  been  assessed  in  healthy  volunteers,  in 
Caucasian, Japanese and Chinese subjects with T2DM and also in T2DM patients with renal and 
hepatic impairment. This is considered an adequate approach. 
In  healthy  subjects  and  in  Caucasian,  Japanese  and  Chinese  patients  with  type  2  diabetes 
administration of empagliflozin results in a dose-dependent increase in urinary glucose excretion 
(UGE). UGE increases immediately following the first dose of empagliflozin, is observed over the 
entire  24-h  dosing  interval  and  is  maintained  at  the  end  of  a  4-week  treatment  period.  It 
averages  at  about  78  g/day  with  25 mg  empagliflozin  once  daily.  A  plateau  appears  to  be 
reached  at  the  10  mg  dose  of  empagliflozin  once  daily.  No  significant  differences  were  found 
between  10  mg  and  25  mg.  In  the  clinical  studies  the  10  mg  as  well  as  the  25  mg  dose  have 
been studied. This is justified for an optimal dose selection. 
In  healthy  volunteers  empagliflozin  does  not  have  any  effect  on  plasma  glucose  levels  despite 
increased glycosuria. However in patients with T2DM  empagliflozin  reduces  plasma glucose in a 
more or less dose dependent fashion. 
In renal impairment with empagliflozin, cumulative amounts of glucose in urine decrease, which 
can  be  expected  base  on  the  mechanism  of  action.  However  due  to  limited  data  the  impact  of 
lowered glomerular filtration rate on plasma glucose in T2DM as well as the safety aspects should 
be further assessed in clinical studies.

Page 36/99 
 
  
  
In patients with liver impairment on the basis of pharmacokinetic results  no dosage adjustment 
of  empagliflozin  can  be  recommended.  The  impact  of  liver  impairment  on  plasma  glucose  in 
T2DM as well as the safety aspects are further assessed in phase III studies (see below). 
A  thorough  QT  study  indicates  that  single  oral  doses  of  25  mg  (therapeutic)  and  200  mg 
empagliflozin (supra-therapeutic) in healthy subjects are not associated with prolongation of the 
QT interval. 
It is concluded that the  data concerning pharmacodynamics of empagliflozin indicate efficacy of 
the compound in the treatment of T2DM. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
PK and PD of empagliflozin are adequately characterised and show the characteristics of a SGLT2 
inhibitor. Dose-response data support the use of 10 and 25 mg in the phase III studies.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Dose  selection  for  the  phase  III  program  was  mostly  based  on  the  randomised,  double-blind, 
placebo-controlled  phase  IIb  trials 1245.9  and  1245.10.  In  trial  1245.9 empagliflozin  (up  to  25 
mg once  daily)  was administered as monotherapy and  in trial 1245.10, empagliflozin  (up  to 50 
mg once daily) was administered as add-on therapy to a background regimen of metformin. All 
doses were well tolerated and showed a good safety profile. The primary endpoint HbA1c in trials 
1245.9 and 1245.10 was the change from baseline in HbA1c after 12 weeks. In study 1245.9, an 
open-label  metformin  group  was  included  (2x1000  mg,  or  maximum  tolerated  dose).  In  study 
1245.10, an open-label sitagliptin group was included (100 mg).  
In  trial  1245.9,  in  which  empagliflozin  was  administered  as  monotherapy,  the  differences 
between empagliflozin  and  placebo  in the  adjusted  mean  changes  from  baseline  in  HbA1c  after 
12 weeks increased with increasing dose of empagliflozin and were: -0.52% (5 mg), -0.57% (10 
mg), and -0.72% (25 mg). The effect on the HbA1c level was highest in the metformin group (-
0.85%). 
In  trial  1245.10,  in  which  empagliflozin  was  administered  as  add-on  therapy  to  background 
medication  with  metformin,  the  differences  between  empagliflozin  and  placebo  in  the  adjusted 
mean  changes  from  baseline  in  HbA1c  after  12  weeks  were  -0.24%  (1  mg),  -0.39%  (5  mg),  -
0.71% (10 mg), -0.70% (25 mg), and -0.64% (50 mg).

and  3994  patients  were  randomised  to  empagliflozin  25  mg.  Another  3081  patients 
were  randomised  to  receive  placebo  and  1154  patients  were  randomised  to  an  active 
comparator.  At  Day  120  an  additional  (add-on  to  insulin)  study  was  submitted.  Study 
1245.49  enrolled  563  subjects  of  whom  186  received  empagliflozin  10  mg  and  189 
empagliflozin 25 mg. See Table 3 for an overview of the trials.

6  Sitagliptin (71 patients) or metformin (80 patients) 
The pivotal data on efficacy and safety of empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
are derived from 4 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase III trials 
of empagliflozin (10 mg or 25 mg once daily) with a treatment duration of 24 weeks (1245.20, 
1245.23(met),  1245.23(met+SU),  and  1245.19).  In  total,  2957  patients  were  treated  in  these 
trials. The trials were identical in their main design features and trial procedures, but differed in

the  required  antidiabetic  background  medication.  Trial  1245.20  investigated  empagliflozin  as 
monotherapy and also included an active control group (sitagliptin).  
Supportive  longer-term  data  are  derived  from  the  double-blind,  controlled  extensions  of  the  4 
pivotal  trials  (1245.31).  In  these  on-going  trials,  patients  continued  on  the  randomised  trial 
treatment and the background medication they had taken in the initial trials.  
Further  supportive  data  come  from  the  5  randomised,  double-blind,  controlled  trials  1245.36, 
1245.48,  1245.25,  1245.28  (all  phase  III),  and  1245.33  (phase  IIb),  all  conducted  in  patients 
with  type  2  diabetes.  Trial  1245.36  was  performed  in  patients  with  various  degrees  of  renal 
impairment,  trial  1245.48  in  patients  with  hypertension,  and  the  large  cardiovascular  outcome 
trial  1245.25  (on-going)  tests  empagliflozin  in  patients  with  high  cardiovascular  risk.  Trial 
1245.33  was  conducted  in  patients  with  basal  insulin  as  background  therapy.  These  4  trials 
(1245.36,  1245.48,  1245.25,  1245.33)  were  placebo-controlled,  allowed  different  background 
medications,  and  tested 10  mg  and  25  mg  empagliflozin  (but  only  empagliflozin  25  mg  for  the 
subgroups of patients with moderate or severe renal impairment in trial 1245.36). Trial 1245.28 
(on-going)  is  active-controlled  and  compares  25  mg  empagliflozin  once  daily  with  glimepiride 
(maximal tolerated dose between 1 and 4 mg) in patients with a metformin background therapy.

The robustness of the results was confirmed across a number of sensitivity 
analyses, both for the primary and for the key secondary endpoints. 
Other analysed endpoints – blood pressure, waist circumference, the pre-
defined composite endpoint (change in HbA1c, blood pressure, and body 
weight), relative response, treat-to-target response, and use of rescue 
medication – supported the findings for the primary and key secondary 
endpoints regarding the effect of the empagliflozin treatment (both doses) 
compared with placebo.

Notes 
The robustness of the results was confirmed across a number of sensitivity 
analyses, both for the primary and for the key secondary endpoints. 
Other analysed endpoints – FPG, waist circumference, the pre-defined 
composite endpoint (change in HbA1c, blood pressure, and body weight), 
relative response, treat-to-target response, and use of rescue medication – 
supported the findings for the primary and key secondary endpoints 
regarding the effect of the empagliflozin treatment (both doses) compared 
with placebo.

Notes 
The robustness of the results was confirmed across a number of sensitivity 
analyses, both for the primary and for the key secondary endpoints. 
Other analysed endpoints – FPG, blood pressure, waist circumference, the 
pre-defined composite endpoint (change in HbA1c, blood pressure, and body 
weight), relative response, treat-to-target response, and use of rescue 
medication – supported the findings for the primary and key secondary 
endpoints regarding the effect of the empagliflozin treatment (both doses) 
compared with placebo. 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria  
The  main  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  were  harmonised  across  the  trials.  Men  and  women 
diagnosed  with  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  and  with  insufficient  glycaemic  control  (HbA1c  ≥7.0%; 
upper  limit  10.0%  in  most  trials/sites),  with  a  BMI  of  ≤45  kg/m2  and  at  least  18  years  of  age 
(for patients in Japan the minimum age was 20 years) were to be included in the trials. Each of 
the  trials  had  specific  additional  eligibility  requirements,  e.g.  with  regard  to  the  permitted 
antidiabetic background medication (which was not  provided as part of the trial medication). In 
general,  patients  with  various  degrees  of  renal  impairment  were  eligible  for  the  empagliflozin 
phase-III  programme.  However,  the  allowed  degree  of  renal  impairment  differed  between  the 
trials  depending  on  the  background  medication  and  comparator;  patients  with  severe  renal 
impairment  (<30  mL/min/1.73  m2)  were  only  admitted  in  trial  1245.36.  Patients  were  not 
allowed  to  participate  in  any  trial  if  they  had  a  history  of  acute  coronary  syndrome,  stroke,  or 
transient ischaemic attack within 3 months (2 months for 1245.25) prior to informed consent. 
Primary endpoint 
The  trials  critical  for  the  evaluation  of  efficacy  used  the  same  primary  endpoint  to  assess 
antidiabetic  efficacy:  the  change  from  baseline  in  HbA1c.  Exceptions  were  the  double-blind 
extensions  of  the  pivotal  trials  (1245.31),  in  which  HbA1c  was  a  secondary  endpoint 
(confirmatory  testing  was  done  only  in  the  preceding  trials).  Another  exception  was  the 
cardiovascular  safety  trial  1245.25,  which  had  a  safety-related  primary  endpoint;  the  change 
from  baseline  in  HbA1c  was  an  exploratory  endpoint.  In  all  trials,  blood  samples  for  the 
determination  of  HbA1c  were  analysed 
in  central 
laboratories  that  held  a  National 
Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program Level I certificate. 
Secondary endpoints 
Four endpoints were considered secondary endpoints for the pooled analyses of efficacy, i.e. the 
changes  from  baseline  in  FPG,  body  weight,  SBP,  and  DBP.  On  trial  level,  FPG  was  a  key 
secondary endpoint in the pivotal trial 1245.19, and body weight was a key secondary endpoint 
in the 4 pivotal trials and in the glimepiride-controlled trial 1245.28. SBP and DBP were defined 
as  key  secondary  endpoints  in  trials  1245.20  and  1245.28.  Furthermore,  in  trial  1245.48 
(patients  with  diabetes  and  hypertension),  24-h  SBP  was  a  co-primary  endpoint  and  24-h  DBP 
was a key secondary endpoint. These key secondary endpoints were part of the testing hierarchy 
of  the  respective  trial.  Thus,  the  trial-level  results  for  these  endpoints  provide  confirmatory 
evidence. 
In general, efficacy analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle and were based on the full 
analysis set (FAS), which included all randomised patients who received at least one dose of trial 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/137741/2014 
Page 47/99 
 
  
  
 
 
medication and had  a baseline HbA1c measurement  (and in trial 1245.48 also a baseline mean 
24-hour SBP measurement). Per-protocol sets (PPS) were usually defined on trial level to assess 
the  robustness  of  the  efficacy  results.  The  PPS  comprised  all  patients  of  the  FAS  who  did  not 
have any important protocol violations with a potential influence on the primary efficacy data. 
The main analyses  of efficacy were based on  ANCOVA  models and employed a last observation 
carried  forward  (LOCF)  approach  to  impute  missing  data,  whereby  also  baseline  values  were 
carried  forward  in  case  no  post-baseline  value  was  available.  Values  measured  after  a  patient 
had taken rescue medication were excluded and imputed using the LOCF method. 
Patient Populations Studied 
Premature discontinuation 
The  rates  of  premature  discontinuations  of  trial  medication  were  low  in  all  pivotal  trials,  with  a 
consistently  higher  rate  in  the  placebo  groups  than  in  the  empagliflozin  10  mg  and  25  mg 
groups. In the empagliflozin groups, a maximum of  8.9% of patients discontinued prematurely. 
The  most  frequent  reasons  for  premature  discontinuations  were  adverse  events  (other  than 
worsening of disease under study or other pre-existing disease) in trials 1245.19, 1245.23(met), 
and 1245.23(met+SU), or patient refusal to continue trial medication (not due to adverse event) 
in  trial  1245.20.  Discontinuation  rates  were  similar  for  the  other  phase  III  trials.  In  the  longer 
(78-week)  trial  1245.33  in  patients  with  basal  insulin  and  thus  more  advanced  disease, 
premature  discontinuations  were  more  frequent  (overall  27.1%)  than  in  the  pivotal  trials  but 
again numerically higher in the placebo group than in the empagliflozin groups.  
Long-term efficacy  analyses  (>24  weeks)  of  the  pivotal trials  and  their double-blind extensions 
(1245.31)  were  based  on  the  pooling  of  the  4  pivotal  trials.  Of  all  patients  randomised  and 
treated  in  the  4  pivotal  trials,  91.1%  completed  treatment  in  the  24-week  pivotal  trials  as 
planned and 68.7% continued into the extension trials. For the pooled analyses in this grouping, 
patients  who  had  completed  the  initial  trial  but  did  not  enter  the  extension  trial  (for  various 
reasons,  e.g.  trial  site  did  not  participate  in  extension  trial  or  patient’s  wish)  were  counted  as 
premature  discontinuations.  These  22.3%  of  patients  contributed  to  the  overall  discontinuation 
rate  of  35.8%.  When  these  patients  are  not  counted,  the  rates  of  premature  discontinuations 
were 17.1% in the placebo group, 10.8% for empagliflozin 10 mg, and 12.8% for empagliflozin 
25 mg. 
Duration of exposure 
The  duration  of  exposure to  randomised  trial  medication  in  the  pivotal  trials was  similar  across 
treatment  groups  and  very  close  to  the  planned  treatment  duration  of  24  weeks.  When  taking 
the extension trials (1245.31) into consideration, exposure tended to be shorter for placebo than 
for  empagliflozin;  median  exposure  was  328  days  (placebo),  371  days  (empagliflozin  10  mg), 
and 364 days (empagliflozin 25 mg). Total exposure to trial medication in the pivotal trials and 
their extensions amounted to 699.7 years in the placebo group, 785.4 years in the empagliflozin 
10 mg group, and 759.7 years in the empagliflozin 25 mg group. In the other trials, duration of 
exposure was very similar in all treatment groups. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/137741/2014 
Page 48/99 
 
  
  
Key  demographic  and  baseline  characteristics  were  generally  balanced  across  all  randomised 
treatment groups. In the pivotal trials, just over half (54.5%) of the patients were men. Most of 
the patients (51.2%) had mild renal impairment, i.e. an eGFR of 60 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2, or 
normal  renal  function  (41.4%)  as  assessed  by  eGFR  calculated  with  the  MDRD  formula;  the 
remaining  7.4%  of  patients  had  moderate  renal  impairment,  i.e.  an  eGFR  of  30  to  <60 
mL/min/1.73  m2.  Overall,  55.5%  of  patients  had  a  history  of  hypertension.  Diabetes-related 
concomitant  diagnoses  such  as  diabetic  neuropathy  were  relatively  uncommon  in  the  pivotal 
trials, with highest frequencies observed in trial 1245.23(met+SU).

HbA1c 
All pivotal trials had HbA1c change from baseline at 24 weeks as their primary endpoint. In each 
pivotal  trial,  both  doses  of  empagliflozin  provided  statistically  significant  (p<0.0001)  and 
clinically  meaningful  reductions  in  HbA1c  compared  with  placebo  after  24  weeks  of  treatment 
(Figure 1).

In  the  pivotal  trials,  the  proportion  of  patients  achieving  HbA1c  <7.0%  was  analysed.  In  the 
combined  pivotal  trials,  31.5%  of  patients  in  the  empagliflozin  10  mg  group,  37.2%  in  the 
empagliflozin  25  mg  group,  and  10.5%  in  the  placebo  group  achieved  this  target  (among 
patients with a baseline HbA1c ≥7.0%).  
In trial 1245.33, empagliflozin was investigated in patients with insulin background therapy. The 
primary  endpoint  change  in  HbA1c  was  analysed  after  18  weeks  of  treatment,  until  when  the 
dose of basal insulin had to remain unchanged. The 25 mg dose resulted in a numerically larger 
reduction than 10 mg empagliflozin) (Figure 6). In the empagliflozin groups, 18.0% (10 mg) and 
19.5%  (25  mg)  of  patients  achieved  an  HbA1c  value  below  7.0%,  compared  with  5.5%  of 
patients in the placebo group. During the additional 60-week period, the dose of insulin could be 
adjusted  at  the  discretion  of  the  investigator  for  any  confirmed  fasting  plasma  glucose  (FPG) 
levels >110 mg/dL. After 78 weeks, the placebo-adjusted changes from baseline in mean HbA1c 
were:  -0.46%  (97.5%  CI:  -0.73,  -0.19,  p=0.0001)  for  the  empagliflozin  10  mg  group  and  -
0.62%  (97.5%  CI:  -0.90,  -0.34,  p<0.0001)  for  the  empagliflozin  25  mg  group.  For  the  key 
secondary  endpoint of  basal  insulin  dose,  the  adjusted  mean  differences  from  placebo  at  Week 
78  were  -6.66  IU  in  the empagliflozin  10  mg  group  (97.5%  CI:  -11.56,  -1.77)  and  -5.92  IU  in 
the empagliflozin 25 mg group (97.5% CI: -11.00, -0.85).

During  the  registration  process,  a  second  study  in  patients  with  an  insulin  background  therapy 
was  submitted.  Study  1245.49,  a  randomized,  blinded  placebo-controlled  52-week  study, 
enrolled  563  subjects  in  total,  186  subjects  were  treated  with  10  mg  empagliflozin  and  189 
subjects  with  25  mg  empagliflozin,  as  add-on  to  multiple  daily  injection  insulin  therapy  with  or 
without metformin in type 2 diabetes. In this study, subjects maintained a stable insulin dose for 
the first 18 weeks and the primary outcome was the change in HbA1c after 18 weeks. Thereafter 
from  week  18  to  week  40,  insulin  doses  were  adjusted  treat-to-target  and  for  week  40  to  52, 
insulin doses maintained stable. Change in HbA1c was  -0.44 (97.5% CI -0.61;-0.27) for 10 mg 
empagliflozin  and  -0.52  (97.5%CI  -0.69;-0.35)  for  25  mg  empagliflozin,  compared  to  placebo. 
After 52 weeks, the adjusted mean changes in insulin dose from baseline compared with placebo 
were  -8.83  IU/day  (97.5%  CI:  -15.69,  -1.97;  p=0.0040)  for  empagliflozin  10  mg  and  -11.22 
IU/day  (97.5%  CI:  -18.09,  -4.36,  p=0.0003)  for  empagliflozin  25  mg.  The  placebo-adjusted 
mean changes in HbA1c values at 52 weeks were -0.38% (97.5% CI: -0.62% to -0.13%) for 10 
mg and -0.46% (97.5% CI: -0.70% to -0.22%) for 25 mg. 
The  non-inferiority  of  empagliflozin  to  an  established  standard-of-care  comparator  was 
investigated in the glimepiride-controlled trial 1245.28. In this on-going trial, an interim analysis 
was  performed  following  52  weeks  of  treatment  with  25  mg  empagliflozin  or  1  to  4  mg 
glimepiride.  The  actual  mean  daily  dose  of  glimepiride  taken  during  the  treatment  period  was 
2.71 mg (SD 1.24 mg). The non-inferiority margin was defined as 0.3% for the primary analysis 
of  HbA1c  change  from  baseline.  It  was  met  with  a  p-value  of  <0.0001.  The  adjusted  mean 
changes from baseline (ANCOVA) after 52 weeks were  -0.73% in the empagliflozin group and  -
0.66% in the glimepiride group (Figure 7). Of the patients with a baseline HbA1c ≥7.0%, similar 
proportions  in  both  groups  achieved  a  HbA1c  value  <7.0%  after  52  weeks  (empagliflozin: 
38.7%, glimepiride: 39.0%).

Figure  7  Adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  up  to  52  weeks  in  HbA1c  [%]  in  the 
glimepiride-controlled trial 1245.28 
In  the  12-week  trial  in  patients  with  type  2  diabetes  and  hypertension  (trial  1245.48),  the 
primary analysis showed that, compared to placebo, there was a relevant decrease in HbA1c (-
0.62% (95% CI:  -0.72 to  -0.52%) and 0.65% (95% CI:  -0.75 to  -0.55%) for empagliflozin 10 
and  25  mg,  respectively).  This  was  confirmed  by  the  proportions  of  patients  who  achieved  an 
HbA1c value below 7.0% at the end of treatment: 7.1% for placebo, 30.9% for empagliflozin 10 
mg, and 29.9% for empagliflozin 25 mg. 
In the trial in patients with renal impairment (trial 1245.36), only the higher empagliflozin dose 
(25 mg) was investigated in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment. In patients with 
mild  renal  impairment,  both  doses  of  empagliflozin  (10  mg  and  25  mg)  were  tested.  In 
comparison  to  placebo,  the  change  in  HbA1c  at  Week  24  in  patients  with  mild  (i.e.  GFR  60-
90ml/min)  renal  impairment  was  -0.52%  (95%  CI:  -0.72  to  -0.32%)  for  empagliflozin  10  mg 
and -0.68% (-0.88 to -0.49%) for empagliflozin 25 mg. In patients with moderate (i.e. GFR 30-
60 ml/min) renal impairment, the placebo-adjusted treatment effect for empagliflozin 25 mg was 
-0.42%  (-0.56  to  -0.28%).  The  patients  with  moderate  renal  impairment  were  subdivided  in 
patients  with  GFR  45-60  and  30-45  ml/min.  The  adjusted  mean  treatment  differences  for 
empagliflozin  25  mg  compared  with  placebo  were  -0.46  and  -0.39%,  respectively.  The 
categorical response (HbA1c <7.0%) at Week 24 were in line with the results for HbA1c change 
from  baseline:  17.0%  (empagliflozin  10  mg)  and  24.2%  (empagliflozin  25  mg)  of  the  patients 
with mild renal impairment achieved this target (placebo: 6.7%). Among patients with moderate 
renal impairment, 12.0% in the empagliflozin 25 mg group reached the target (placebo: 7.9%). 
For the small group of patients with severe renal impairment (37 patients per treatment group), 
descriptive statistics revealed no reduction of HbA1c compared with placebo.

Fasting plasma glucose 
The  change  from  baseline  in  FPG  was  a  secondary  endpoint  in  all  of  the  pivotal  placebo-
controlled  trials.  In  each  pivotal  trial,  both  doses  of  empagliflozin  provided  reductions  in  FPG 
after 24 weeks of treatment compared with placebo. In the placebo groups, mean FPG increased 
slightly  from  baseline  to  24  weeks.  After  52  weeks  in  the  on-going  trial  1245.28,  there  were 
clinically  meaningful  reductions  in  FPG  in  both  the  empagliflozin  and  the  glimepiride  groups. 
However,  the  reduction  was  larger  in  the  empagliflozin  group  than  in  the  glimepiride  group.  In 
each  of  the  other  individual  trials  (1245.33,  1245.48,  1245.36),  empagliflozin  provided 
reductions in FPG compared with placebo. The FPG reductions were generally in a similar range 
as for the pivotal trials. 
Body weight 
The change from baseline in body weight at 24 weeks was defined as a key secondary endpoint 
in all pivotal trials. In each pivotal trial, both doses of empagliflozin were superior (p<0.0001) to 
placebo, with similar reductions in each trial (Figure 8). 
Figure  8  Adjusted  mean  difference  (with  95%  confidence  intervals)  between 
empagliflozin  and  placebo  in  body  weight  after  24  weeks  for  the  pivotal  trials  –  FAS 
(LOCF) 
Treatment with glimepiride led to a 1.60 kg increase in mean body weight after 52 weeks. Mean 
body  weight  decreased  by  3.21  kg  in  the  empagliflozin  25  mg  group.  The  resulting  adjusted 
mean  difference  between  treatment  groups  of  4.81  kg  (95%  CI:  -5.12,  -4.50)  demonstrated 
superiority of empagliflozin 25 mg to the sulphonylurea glimepiride. 
Body  weight  was  an  exploratory  endpoint  in  trials  1245.33,  1245.48,  1245.36.  In  each  trial, 
empagliflozin  provided  reductions  in  body  weight  compared  with  placebo.  The  reductions  were 
generally in a similar range as for the pivotal trials. 
The  additional  add-on  to  insulin  study  (1245.49)  also  investigated  the  change  in  body  weight. 
Compared  with  placebo,  the  adjusted  mean  changes  from  baseline  at  52  weeks  were  -2.39  kg

(97.5%  CI:  -3.54  to  -1.24  kg;  p<0.0001)  for  empagliflozin  10  mg  and  -2.48  kg  (97.5%  CI: 
-3.63 to -1.33, p<0.0001) for empagliflozin 25 mg. 
Blood pressure 
Blood  pressure  was  analysed  as  an  efficacy  endpoint.  In  the  pivotal  trials,  empagliflozin  was 
associated with a reduction in blood pressure. Results for SBP and DBP are summarised in Figure 
9.

and placebo in SBP and DBP after 24 weeks for the pivotal trials. 
In trial 1245.28, treatment with empagliflozin was superior to glimepiride for both SBP and DBP 
changes from baseline. After 52 weeks, the adjusted mean difference in SBP to glimepiride was -
5.8  mmHg  (97.5%  CI:  -7.3,  -4.4)  with  p<0.0001.  The  corresponding  treatment  difference  for 
DBP was -2.8 mmHg (97.5% CI: -3.7, -2.0) with p<0.0001.

In  the  trial  in  patients  with  hypertension  (trial  1245.48)  ambulatory  blood  pressure  monitoring 
(ABPM)  was  employed.  Both  doses  of  empagliflozin  were  superior  to  placebo  for  24-h  SBP  and 
24-h  DBP  changes  from  baseline.  After  the  12-week  treatment  period,  the  adjusted  mean 
treatment differences for 24-h SBP were -3.44 mmHg (95% CI: -4.78,-2.09) for empagliflozin 10 
mg  and  -4.16  mmHg  (95%  CI:  5.50,-2.83)  for  empagliflozin  25  mg.  For  24-h  DBP,  the 
corresponding  differences  to  placebo  were  1.36  mmHg  (95%  CI:  -2.15,-0.56)  for  empagliflozin 
10 mg and -1.72 mmHg (95% CI: 2.51,-0.93) for empagliflozin 25 mg.  
Changes in SBP and DBP were analysed as exploratory endpoints in the other placebo-controlled 
trials (1245.33, 1245.36). Results were in a similar range as for the pivotal trials (with somewhat 
smaller reductions in trial 1245.33). 
Rescue medication 
In most trials, rescue medication was to be initiated during the first 12 weeks of treatment only if 
a patient had a confirmed glucose level of >240 mg/dL after an overnight fast (and if the glucose 
level  was  >200  mg/dL  during  the  subsequent  12  weeks).  In  each  of  the  pivotal  trials,  a  lower 
proportion of patients in the empagliflozin groups than in the placebo group required antidiabetic 
rescue medication (i.e. increase in dose of background medication or initiation of a new drug). In 
the  pooled  analysis  of  the  pivotal  trials  (EFF-2),  4.1%  of  patients  in  the  empagliflozin  10  mg 
group  and  2.4%  in  the  empagliflozin  25  mg  group  required  rescue  medication  in  the  first  24 
weeks, compared with 15.8% in the placebo group. After 52 weeks, the picture was similar, with 
higher  overall  frequencies.  The  use  of  rescue  medication  in  the  first  24  weeks  of  trial  1245.36 
(patients  with  renal  impairment)  and  the  first  18  weeks  of  trial  1245.33  (patients  with  basal 
insulin) was consistent with the observations made for the pivotal trials. In the shorter 12-week 
trial  1245.48  (patients  with  hypertension),  few  patients  required  rescue  medication  and 
frequencies  were  similar  across  treatment  groups.  In  the  active-controlled  trial  1245.28,  fewer 
patients in the empagliflozin group than in the glimepiride group needed rescue medication: after 
52 weeks, frequencies of  patients requiring rescue medication were  7.3%  for empagliflozin and 
13.3% for glimepiride. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses) 
The empagliflozin effects were assessed in a number of subgroups for various demographic and 
baseline  characteristics.  The  subgroup  analyses  used  the 24-week  data  from  the  pooling  of the 
pivotal  trials.  For  all  endpoints  tested, the  efficacy  of  empagliflozin  compared  with  placebo  was 
consistent  across  the  subgroup  categories  for  gender,  race,  baseline  BMI,  and  time  since 
diagnosis  of  diabetes.  Empagliflozin  effects  compared  with  placebo  were  largely  homogeneous 
across the 4 geographical regions. 
Possible treatment-by-subgroup interactions for renal impairment at baseline were observed for 
HbA1c, FPG, and SBP. There were no patients with severe renal impairment in the pivotal trials, 
since  these  patients  were not  allowed  in  the  pivotal  trials.  The  change  in  HbA1c  at  Week 24 in 
patients  with  mild  (i.e.  GFR  60-90ml/min)  renal  impairment  was  0.68%  in  comparison  to 
placebo.  In  patients  with  moderate  (i.e.  GFR  30-60  ml/min)  renal  impairment,  the  placebo-
adjusted  treatment  effect  was  -0.42%.  The  patients  with  moderate  renal  impairment  were 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/137741/2014 
Page 58/99 
 
  
  
 
 
subdivided  in  patients  with  GFR  45-60  and  30-45  ml/min.  The  adjusted  mean  treatment 
differences for empagliflozin 25 mg compared with placebo were -0.46 and -0.39%, respectively. 
In patients with severe renal insufficiency, there was no treatment effect of empagliflozin 25 mg 
compared  with  placebo  after  either  24  weeks  or  52  weeks  of  treatment.  In  the  pivotal  studies, 
the  effect  of  empagliflozin  on  HbA1c  in  individuals  with  GFR  45-60  ml/min  was  of  borderline 
significance (-0.44 for empagliflozin 10 mg and -0.31 for empagliflozin 25 mg). For patients with 
GFR 30-45 ml/min, efficacy was not acceptable (-0.27% and -0.18%, respectively).  
The  subgroup  analyses  by  baseline  HbA1c  showed  that  both  doses  of  empagliflozin  provided 
clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c in each of the individual baseline HbA1c categories. The 
adjusted mean difference in the HbA1c change from baseline between empagliflozin (both doses) 
and  placebo  increased  with  increasing  baseline  HbA1c.  In  the  lowest  baseline  category  (HbA1c 
<8.0%) the treatment difference to placebo was -0.40% for empagliflozin 10 mg and -0.46% for 
empagliflozin  25  mg,  whereas  in  the  highest  baseline  category  (HbA1c  ≥9.0%)  the  treatment 
difference was -1.14% for empagliflozin 10 mg and -1.18% for empagliflozin 25 mg. 
Longer-term effects  
The pivotal trials had a treatment duration of 24 weeks. However, as described above several of 
the  trials  had  a  longer  treatment  duration.  Active-controlled  confirmatory  data  for  up  to  52 
weeks comparing 25 mg empagliflozin with glimepiride are available from the interim analysis of 
trial 1245.28. This trial showed empagliflozin 25 mg to be non-inferior to glimepiride for HbA1c 
reductions  and  superior  to  glimepiride  for  body  weight  and  the  occurrence  of  confirmed 
hypoglycaemic  adverse  events  as  well  as  systolic  and  diastolic  blood  pressure.  Furthermore, 
efficacy of empagliflozin compared with placebo over 52 weeks was investigated in patients with 
renal impairment in trial  1245.36. Empagliflozin compared with placebo was also efficacious for 
up to 78 weeks in patients treated with basal insulin in trial 1245.33. In each of these placebo-
controlled  trials,  sustained  empagliflozin  efficacy  was  shown  not  only  for  glycaemic  control 
(HbA1c, FPG) but also for body weight and blood pressure reductions. 
The interim data from the double-blind extensions (1245.31) of the 4 pivotal trials also provide 
evidence of efficacy for 2 doses of empagliflozin (10 mg and 25 mg) for up to 52 weeks. For the 
pooling of the extension of these pivotal trials, the HbA1c values at baseline were 7.98% in the 
empagliflozin 10 mg group, 7.96% in the empagliflozin 25 mg group, and 8.02% in the  placebo 
group. The efficacy of empagliflozin was almost maximal after 12 weeks and was sustained over 
the 52-week analysis period. The difference to placebo in the adjusted mean change in HbA1c at 
24 weeks (i.e. the time point of the primary analysis of the pivotal trials) was -0.55% (95% CI: -
0.63,  -0.47)  for  the  empagliflozin  10  mg  group  and  -0.60%  (95%  CI:  -0.68,  -0.53)  for  the 
empagliflozin  25  mg  group.  At  52  weeks,  the  treatment  differences  to  placebo  were  almost 
identical to the 24-week time point and were -0.55% (95% CI: -0.66, -0.45) for empagliflozin 10 
mg and -0.59% (95% CI: -0.69, -0.48) for empagliflozin 25 mg. 
Empagliflozin compared to metformin and sitagliptin 
The  phase  IIb  dose-finding  monotherapy  trial  1245.9  tested  various  doses  of  empagliflozin  in 
drug-naïve  patients,  with  immediate-release  metformin  as  an  open-label  comparator  (1000  mg 
twice  daily  or  maximum  tolerated  dose).  The  allocation  to  empagliflozin  and  metformin  was

Page 59/99 
 
  
  
randomised,  but  not  blinded.  The  effect  of  metformin  on  HbA1c  was  -0.85%,  the  effect  of 
empagliflozin 25 mg was -0.72%. 
In study 1245.20, the exploratory comparison of both empagliflozin doses vs. sitagliptin 100 mg 
demonstrated that treatment with empagliflozin  showed a similar reduction in HbA1c compared 
to  treatment  with  sitagliptin  (empagliflozin  10  mg  -0.74%;  empagliflozin  25  mg  -0.85%  vs. 
sitagliptin 100 mg -0.73%). Treatment with both empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg reduced body 
weight and BP compared with sitagliptin treatment. 
Open label empagliflozin in patients with HbA1c above 10.0% 
In the pivotal trials 1245.20 (monotherapy), 1245.23(met), and 1245.23(met+SU), patients with 
HbA1c  above  10%  at baseline  were  offered  the  possibility to  receive open-label  treatment  with 
the  high  empagliflozin  dose  (25  mg).  In  total,  257  patients  were  assigned  to  and  treated  with 
open-label  treatment  with  25  mg  empagliflozin  (39%  with  metformin  plus  sulphonylurea 
background, 27% with  metformin background, and 34% without background treatment). These 
patients were treated for up to 24 weeks, i.e. they did not have the option to continue into the 
extension  trial.  The  proportion of  the  patients  who  prematurely  discontinued trial  medication  in 
the monotherapy setting (1245.20) was only slightly higher than in the randomised empagliflozin 
groups  of  this  trial.  However,  in  trials  1245.23(met)  and  1245.23(met+SU),  premature 
discontinuations among patients with open-label empagliflozin were about twice as frequent as in 
the  randomised  empagliflozin  groups.  For  open-label  treatment,  the  most  frequent  reason 
leading  to  premature  discontinuation  generally  was  patient  refusal  to  continue  trial  medication 
(not due to adverse event). 
Substantial  reductions  of  mean  HbA1c  and  mean  FPG  were  achieved  in  the  open-label 
empagliflozin group of all 3 trials. For all patients in the open-label group (observed cases), the 
mean HbA1c change from baseline to 24 weeks was -3.27%, and the mean FPG change was 66.2 
mg/dL.  Despite  their  very  high  baseline  values,  a  considerable  proportion  of  patients  (15.2%) 
met  the  HbA1c  target  of  <7.0%.  Furthermore,  reductions  of  body  weight,  SBP,  and  DBP  were 
observed and were in a similar range as for the randomised empagliflozin groups. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
A  study  in  patients  with  hypertension  was  performed.  In  this  study,  various  antidiabetic  drugs 
were  used  as  background  medication.  The  findings  in  this  study  in  patients  with  hypertension 
were similar to those in the other studies. Compared to placebo, there was a relevant decrease in 
HbA1c  (-0.62%  and  -0.65%  for  empagliflozin  10  and  25  mg,  respectively).  In  addition,  blood 
pressure  was  lower  with  empagliflozin  (-3.4  and  -4.2  mmHg  for  empagliflozin  10  and  25  mg 
respectively).  This  decrease  in  blood  pressure  may  be  clinically  relevant,  however,  the  diuretic 
effect of empagliflozin may also be associated with adverse events. 
Empagliflozin  was  investigated  in  a  specific  trial  in  patients  with  various  degrees  of  renal 
insufficiency.  The  most  frequent  reason  for  premature  treatment  discontinuation  was  adverse 
events;  reported  for  4.5%  of  patients  with  mild  renal  impairment,  4.3%  of  patients  with 
moderate  renal  impairment,  and  18.9%  of  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment.  Premature 
treatment discontinuation was very high for patients with severe renal insufficiency. The change 
in HbA1c at Week 24 in patients with mild (i.e. GFR 60-90ml/min) renal impairment was 0.68% 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/137741/2014 
Page 60/99 
 
  
  
in comparison to placebo. In patients with moderate (i.e. GFR 30-60 ml/min) renal impairment, 
the placebo-adjusted treatment effect was -0.42%. The patients with moderate renal impairment 
were  subdivided  in  patients  with  GFR  45-60  and  30-45  ml/min.  The  adjusted  mean  treatment 
differences for empagliflozin 25 mg compared with placebo were -0.46 and -0.39%, respectively. 
In patients with severe renal insufficiency, there was no treatment effect of empagliflozin 25 mg 
compared  with  placebo  after  either  24  weeks  or  52  weeks  of  treatment.  In  the  pivotal  studies, 
the  effect  of  empagliflozin  on  HbA1c  in  individuals  with  GFR  45-60  ml/min  was  of  borderline 
significance (-0.33% for empagliflozin 25 mg, n=50 and -0.48% for empagliflozin 10 mg, n=51). 
For patients with GFR 30-45 ml/min, efficacy was also not acceptable (-0.18% for empagliflozin 
25  mg).  These  data  suggest  that,  similar  to  dapagliflozin  and  canagliflozin,  treatment  effects 
diminish with decreasing renal function.  Treatment effects of empagliflozin in patients with GFR 
45-60ml/min are of borderline significance. 
Subgroup analyses of the pivotal trials demonstrate that the treatment effect of empagliflozin in 
patients older than 75 years is only -0.21 and -0.33%. Similar findings were shown in the elderly 
in  the  cardiovascular  safety  trial  (-0.20%  and  -0.30%).  A  further  post-hoc  analysis  of  the 
cardiovascular safety study suggested that efficacy in individuals>75 years with a renal function 
>60 ml/min may be acceptable (-0.48% for empagliflozin 25 mg). However, in the subgroup of 
elderly  patients  >75  years  and  renal  function  45-60  ml/min  efficacy  was  not  acceptable  (-
0.37%). 
Supportive studies 
Combination with insulin 
The use of empagliflozin in combination with insulin was investigated in two separate trials.  
Study  1245.33  consisted  of  two  parts.  During  the  first  part,  a  fixed  insulin  dose  is  used  for  18 
weeks  (except  for  rescue  therapy).  After  that,  an  adjustable  dose  of  insulin  was  used  for  60 
weeks. As could be expected, diabetes duration was longer than in studies in patients not using 
insulin. Compared to placebo without changes in insulin dose, empagliflozin as add on to insulin 
was associated with a clinically relevant reduction in HbA1c of -0.56 (10 mg) and -0.70 (25 mg) 
at 18 weeks. After these  18 weeks, insulin dose adjustments were allowed. The adjusted mean 
differences from placebo at Week 78 were -6.66 IU in the empagliflozin 10 mg group and  -5.92 
IU in the empagliflozin 25 mg group. Despite these changes in insulin dose, compared to placebo 
after  78  weeks,  empagliflozin  as  add  on  to  insulin  was  associated  with  a  clinically  relevant 
reduction  in  HbA1c  of  -0.46  (10  mg)  and  -0.62  (25  mg).  In  addition,  there  were  reductions  in 
body weight with both doses of empagliflozin at Week 18 that were sustained through Week 78; 
the  difference  versus  placebo  for  the  adjusted  mean  change  in  body  weight  from  baseline  at 
Week 78  -3.63 kg for the  empagliflozin  10  mg group  and  -3.12 kg for the empagliflozin  25 mg 
group. 
It  should  be  noted  that  the  changes  in  insulin  dose  were  small  and  not  clinically  relevant.  In 
addition, there was a remarkable difference in baseline HbA1c between the groups. Compared to 
the  placebo,  HbA1c  was  0.16%  and  0.24%  higher  in  the  empagliflozin  10  and  25  mg  groups, 
respectively.  This  may  have  caused  an  overestimation  of  treatment  effects.  Nevertheless,  the 
changes in HbA1c are considered clinically relevant.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/137741/2014 
Page 61/99 
 
  
  
Study 1245.49 was a similar study. This randomized,  blinded placebo-controlled 52-week study 
investigated  empagliflozin  as  add-on  to  multiple  daily  injection  insulin  therapy  with  or  without 
metformin in type 2 diabetes. In this study, subjects maintained a stable insulin dose for the first 
18  weeks.  Change  in  HbA1c  was  -0.44  (97.5%  CI  -0.61;-0.27)  for  10  mg  empagliflozin  and  -
0.52 (97.5%CI -0.69;-0.35) for 25 mg empagliflozin, compared to placebo. After 52 weeks, the 
adjusted mean changes in insulin dose from baseline compared with placebo were -8.83 IU/day 
for empagliflozin 10 mg and -11.22 IU/day for empagliflozin 25 mg. The placebo-adjusted mean 
changes in HbA1c values at 52 weeks were -0.38% for 10 mg and -0.46% for 25 mg. 
Based on these studies, combination with insulin is acceptable. 
Non-inferiority trial 
The  effects  of  empagliflozin  were  compared  to  SU  in  a  non-inferiority  study.  The  decrease  in 
HbA1c was numerically greater with empagliflozin compared to glimepiride (-0.73% vs. -0.66%). 
In  addition,  60%  of  the  patients  in  the  glimepiride  group  was  taking  less  than  the  maximum 
allowed  dose  of  4  mg,  whereas  all  patient  in  the  empagliflozin  group  were  treated  with  the 
maximum  dose  of  25  mg.  This  may  underestimate  the  treatment  effect  of  glimepiride  in 
comparison to empagliflozin. However, this is also observed in clinical practice. It may be difficult 
to  uptitrate  glimepiride  due  to  higher  risk  of  hypoglycaemia.  Efficacy  of  empagliflozin  was 
numerically  larger  than  that  of  glimepiride  and  statistical  non-inferiority  was  established. 
Therefore, a formal non-inferiority claim is acceptable. 
Treatment  with  glimepiride  led  to  a  1.6  kg  increase  in  mean  body  weight  after  52  weeks, 
whereas mean body weight decreased by 3.2 kg in the empagliflozin 25 mg group. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Empagliflozin  is  an  orally administered,  selective inhibitor  of  the  sodium-dependent  glucose  co-
transporter-2  (SGLT-2)  in  the  kidney.  It  is  intended  for  use  in  patients  with  type  2  diabetes 
mellitus. The blood glucose-lowering effect of empagliflozin is independent of insulin secretion or 
action. Empagliflozin’s insulin-independent mode of action results in a low risk of hypoglycaemia. 
Further  effects  of  SGLT  2  inhibition  include  weight  loss  due  to  potential  calorie  loss  through 
urinary glucose excretion and a reduction in blood pressure due to a diuretic effect. 
A  total  of  11250  randomised  and  treated  patients  are  included  in  the  evaluation  of  efficacy 
presented. Of these, 3021 patients were  randomised to empagliflozin 10 mg and 3994 patients 
were  randomised  to  empagliflozin  25  mg.  Another  3081  patients  were  randomised  to  receive 
placebo and 1154 patients were randomised to  an  active comparator. At Day 120 an additional 
(add-on  to  insulin)  study  was  submitted.  Study  1245.49  enrolled  563  subjects  of  whom  186 
received empagliflozin 10 mg and 189 empagliflozin 25 mg.  
Dose finding  
In the dose findings studies, the 25 mg dose of empagliflozin provided better efficacy than the 10 
mg dose. The 50 mg  dose was only investigated  in  study 1245.10. In this study, there was no 
additional benefit of the 50 mg dose in terms of efficacy. The selection of the 10 mg and 25 mg 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/137741/2014 
Page 62/99 
 
  
  
dose  for  the  phase  III  studies  is  reasonable.  In  each  of  the  pivotal  phase  III  trials  except  for 
1245.23  (met+SU)  the  reduction  in  HbA1c  from  baseline  at  24  weeks  was  greater  for 
empagliflozin 25  mg than for empagliflozin  10  mg. The pooled data of the pivotal trials (EFF-2) 
showed that the adjusted mean change from baseline in HbA1c after 24 weeks of treatment was 
-0.70%  for  empagliflozin  10  mg  and  -0.76%  for  empagliflozin  25  mg.  Although  the  25  mg 
performed better, the lower dose also showed clinically significant changes in HbA1c. It could be 
useful to start treatment with this lower dose and then increase the dose if necessary. Therefore 
the CHMP questioned why the Applicant abandoned the 10 mg dose. The Applicant responded by 
re-introducing the 10 mg dose as a starting dose. In principle, this approach is supported from a 
clinical efficacy and safety point of view. 
Pivotal studies 
Treatment with empagliflozin 10  mg or 25 mg once  daily resulted in improvement  of glycaemic 
control  with  modest  reductions  of  HbA1c  and  FPG.  The  4  pivotal  trials  demonstrated  the 
superiority of both doses of empagliflozin to placebo after 24 weeks 
Monotherapy:  Comparison  of  the  test  agent  to  placebo  in  the  monotherapy  setting  is  always 
required  to  evaluate  the  genuine  glucose  lowering  effect  and  safety  profile  of  the  new  agent, 
independent  of  whether  the  marketing  authorisation  is  intended  for  monotherapy  or  add-on 
therapy. After 24 weeks, compared to placebo, empagliflozin monotherapy was associated with a 
clinically relevant reduction in HbA1c of -0.74 (10 mg) and -0.85 (25 mg). These reductions were 
similar compared to the effect of sitagliptin 100 mg (-0.73). With empagliflozin, there were small 
changes in body weight (-1.9 and -2.2kg, respectively), but not with sitagliptin (+0.5kg).  
However,  if  an  indication  for  first  line  (unrestricted)  monotherapy  is  intended,  a  monotherapy 
study  comparing  the  test  drug  to  metformin  is  always  needed.  A  formal  comparison  was  not 
performed,  but  dose  finding  study  1245.9  included empagliflozin  and  metformin.  The  allocation 
to  empagliflozin  and  metformin  was  randomised,  but  not  blinded.  Nevertheless,  a  comparison 
can  be  performed.  The  effect  of  metformin  on  HbA1c  was  larger  (-0.85%)  compared  to 
empagliflozin 25 mg (-0.72%). 
An  additional  issue  is  the  fact  that,  other  efficacy  measures  such  as  effects  on  micro-  and 
macrovascular  endpoints  may  need  to  be  evaluated  before  a  first  line  monotherapy  indication 
would  be  considered  approvable.  For  empagliflozin,  micro-  and  macrovascular  endpoints  have 
not been studied.  
Taken together, a first line indication for empagliflozin is not acceptable. Therefore, the Applicant 
claims  a  restricted  monotherapy  indication:  When  diet  and  exercise  alone  do  not  provide 
adequate  glycaemic  control  in  patients  for  whom  use  of  metformin  is  considered  inappropriate. 
Patients  with  renal  insufficiency  were  investigated  in  a  specific  trial  (see  below).  Patients  with 
gastrointestinal  complaints  with  metformin  were  not  specifically  investigated,  but  this  is  not 
considered  to  be  an  important  issue.  With  respect  to  heart  failure,  there  is  no  experience  in 
clinical studies with empagliflozin in NYHA class III-IV. 
Add-on to metformin with and without SU: The use of empagliflozin as add-on to metformin with 
and without SU is relevant for clinical practice. Compared to placebo, empagliflozin as add on to 
metformin  was  associated  with  a  clinically  relevant  reduction  in  HbA1c  of  -0.57  (10  mg)  and  -
Assessment report

0.64 (25 mg). In  addition, compared to placebo, empagliflozin as add on to metformin plus SU 
was also associated with a clinically relevant reduction in HbA1c of -0.64 (10 mg) and -0.59 (25 
mg).  There  were  small  decreases  in  body  weight  (-1.6  to  -2.0  kg).  The  efficacy  of  the 
combination of empagliflozin with metformin and metformin plus SU is acceptable. 
Add-on  to  pioglitazone  with  and  without  metformin:  The  use  of  empagliflozin  as  add-on  to 
pioglitazone with and without metformin is relevant. Compared to placebo, empagliflozin as add 
on to pioglitazone was associated with a clinically relevant reduction in HbA1c of  -0.48 (10 mg) 
and -0.61 (25 mg). There were small decreases in body weight (-2.0 and -1.8 kg, respectively). 
The  majority  of  patients  were  treated  with  pioglitazone  with  metformin.  Only  a  minority  of  the 
patients  was  treated  with  empagliflozin  in  combination  with  pioglitazone  without  metformin. 
However, efficacy was similar in both subgroups. 
Other  outcome  measures  in  pivotal  studies:  In  these  pivotal  trials,  body  weight  was  decreased 
with  empagliflozin.  The  treatment  difference  to  placebo  at  24  weeks  was  1.8  kg  for  the 
empagliflozin 10 mg group and 2.0 kg for the empagliflozin 25 mg group. In the pivotal studies, 
in comparison to placebo, empagliflozin was associated with a lower systolic (-2.1 to -4.9 mmHg) 
and  diastolic  blood  pressure  systolic  (-0.5  to  -2.5  mmHg).  The  sub-studies  investigating  the 
effects  on  mean  daily  glucose,  body  composition  and  the  meal  tolerance  tests  are  of  interest. 
However, it is not known whether or not the effects are of clinical relevance. 
Combination with insulin 
The use of empagliflozin in combination with insulin was investigated in two separate trials.  
Study  1245.33  consisted  of  two  parts.  During  the  first  part,  a  fixed  insulin  dose  is  used  for  18 
weeks  (except  for  rescue  therapy).  After  that,  an  adjustable  dose  of  insulin  was  used  for  60 
weeks. As could be expected, diabetes duration was longer than in studies in patients not using 
insulin. Compared to placebo without changes in insulin dose, empagliflozin as add on to insulin 
was associated with a clinically relevant reduction in HbA1c of -0.56 (10 mg) and -0.70 (25 mg) 
at 18 weeks. After these  18 weeks, insulin dose adjustments were allowed. The adjusted mean 
differences from placebo at Week 78 were -6.66 IU in the empagliflozin 10 mg group and  -5.92 
IU in the empagliflozin 25 mg group. Despite these changes in insulin dose, compared to placebo 
after  78  weeks,  empagliflozin  as  add  on  to  insulin  was  associated  with  a  clinically  relevant 
reduction  in  HbA1c  of  -0.46  (10  mg)  and  -0.62  (25  mg).  In  addition,  there  were  reductions  in 
body weight with both doses of empagliflozin at Week 18 that were sustained through Week 78; 
the  difference  versus  placebo  for  the  adjusted  mean  change  in  body  weight  from  baseline  at 
Week 78  -3.63 kg for the  empagliflozin  10  mg group and  -3.12 kg for the empagliflozin  25 mg 
group. 
It  should  be  noted  that  the  changes  in  insulin  dose  were  small  and  not  clinically  relevant.  In 
addition, there was a remarkable difference in baseline HbA1c between the groups. Compared to 
the  placebo,  HbA1c  was  0.16%  and  0.24%  higher  in  the  empagliflozin  10  and  25  mg  groups, 
respectively.  This  may  have  caused  an  overestimation  of  treatment  effects.  Nevertheless,  the 
changes in HbA1c are considered clinically relevant.  
Study 1245.49 was a similar study. This randomized, blinded placebo-controlled 52-week study 
investigated  empagliflozin  as  add-on  to  multiple  daily  injection  insulin  therapy  with  or  without

metformin in type 2 diabetes. In this study, subjects maintained a stable insulin dose for the first 
18  weeks.  Change  in  HbA1c  was  -0.44  (97.5%  CI  -0.61;-0.27)  for  10  mg  empagliflozin  and  -
0.52 (97.5%CI -0.69;-0.35) for 25 mg empagliflozin, compared to placebo. After 52 weeks, the 
adjusted mean changes in insulin dose from baseline compared with placebo were  -8.83 IU/day 
for empagliflozin 10 mg and -11.22 IU/day for empagliflozin 25 mg. The placebo-adjusted mean 
changes in HbA1c values at 52 weeks were -0.38% for 10 mg and -0.46% for 25 mg. 
Based on these studies, combination with insulin is acceptable. 
Non-inferiority trial 
The  effects  of  empagliflozin  were  compared  to  SU  in  a  non-inferiority  study.  The  decrease  in 
HbA1c was numerically greater with empagliflozin compared to glimepiride (-0.73% vs. -0.66%). 
In  addition,  60%  of  the  patients  in  the  glimepiride  group  was  taking  less  than  the  maximum 
allowed  dose  of  4  mg,  whereas  all  patient  in  the  empagliflozin  group  were  treated  with  the 
maximum  dose  of  25  mg.  This  may  underestimate  the  treatment  effect  of  glimepiride  in 
comparison to empagliflozin. However, this is also observed in clinical practice. It may be difficult 
to  uptitrate  glimepiride  due  to  higher  risk  of  hypoglycaemia.  Efficacy  of  empagliflozin  was 
numerically  larger  than  that  of  glimepiride  and  statistical  non-inferiority  was  established. 
Therefore, a formal non-inferiority claim is acceptable. 
Treatment  with  glimepiride  led  to  a  1.6  kg  increase  in  mean  body  weight  after  52  weeks, 
whereas mean body weight decreased by 3.2 kg in the empagliflozin 25 mg group. 
Special populations 
A  study  in  patients  with  hypertension  was  performed.  In  this  study,  various  antidiabetic  drugs 
were  used  as  background  medication.  The  findings  in  this  study  in  patients  with  hypertension 
were similar to those in the other studies. Compared to placebo, there was a relevant decrease in 
HbA1c  (-0.62%  and  -0.65%  for  empagliflozin  10  and  25  mg,  respectively).  In  addition,  blood 
pressure  was  lower  with  empagliflozin  (-3.4  and  -4.2  mmHg  for  empagliflozin  10  and  25  mg 
respectively).  This  decrease  in  blood  pressure  may  be  clinically  relevant,  however,  the  diuretic 
effect of empagliflozin may also be associated with adverse events. 
Empagliflozin  was  investigated  in  a  specific  trial  in  patients  with  various  degrees  of  renal 
insufficiency.  The  most  frequent  reason  for  premature  treatment  discontinuation  was  adverse 
events;  reported  for  4.5%  of  patients  with  mild  renal  impairment,  4.3%  of  patients  with 
moderate  renal  impairment,  and  18.9%  of  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment.  Premature 
treatment discontinuation was very high for patients with severe renal insufficiency. The change 
in HbA1c at Week 24 in patients with mild (i.e. GFR 60-90ml/min) renal impairment was 0.68% 
in comparison to placebo. In patients with moderate (i.e. GFR 30-60 ml/min) renal impairment, 
the placebo-adjusted treatment effect was -0.42%. The patients with moderate renal impairment 
were  subdivided  in  patients  with  GFR  45-60  and  30-45  ml/min.  The  adjusted  mean  treatment 
differences for empagliflozin 25 mg compared with placebo were -0.46 and -0.39%, respectively. 
In patients with severe renal insufficiency, there was no treatment effect of empagliflozin 25 mg 
compared  with  placebo  after  either  24  weeks  or  52  weeks  of  treatment.  In  the  pivotal  studies, 
the  effect  of  empagliflozin  on  HbA1c  in  individuals  with  GFR  45-60  ml/min  was  of  borderline

significance (-0.33% for empagliflozin 25 mg, n=50 and -0.48% for empagliflozin 10 mg, n=51). 
For patients with GFR 30-45 ml/min, efficacy was also not acceptable (-0.18% for empagliflozin 
25  mg).  These  data  suggest  that,  similar  to  dapagliflozin  and  canagliflozin,  treatment  effects 
diminish with decreasing renal function.  Treatment effects of empagliflozin in patients with GFR 
45-60ml/min are of borderline significance. 
Subgroup analyses of the pivotal trials demonstrate that the treatment effect of empagliflozin in 
patients older than 75 years is only -0.21 and -0.33%.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In clinical trials two doses were used: 10 mg and 25 mg. In general, the 25 mg dose performed 
slightly better, but 10 mg might be considered as a starting dose.  During the procedure, the 10 
mg dose was added to the dossier following the CHMP request.  
The Applicant claimed a restricted monotherapy indication: When diet and exercise alone do not 
provide  adequate  glycaemic  control  in  patients  for  whom  use  of  metformin  is  considered 
inappropriate. An indication for empagliflozin monotherapy in patients for whom metformin is not 
appropriate  due 
to  gastrointestinal  complaints  may  be  acceptable.  However,  other 
contraindications for metformin, such as heart failure and moderate or severe renal insufficiency 
are not acceptable. Patients with heart failure have not been investigated. In the trial in patients 
with renal impairment, treatment effects of empagliflozin in patients with mild renal impairment 
(GFR 60-90 ml/min) were clinically relevant  (-0.68%), but treatment effects of empagliflozin in 
patients with GFR<45-60 ml/min are  of  borderline significance.  Efficacy  of empagliflozin  add-on 
to metformin, add-on to metformin plus SU, add-on to pioglitazone with and without metformin 
and add-on to basal insulin is acceptable. 
Subgroup  analyses  of  the  trial  in  patients  with  renal  impairment  suggest  that  the  reduced 
efficacy in patients >75 years is explained by renal impairment. In individuals >75 years with a 
renal function >60 ml/min efficacy may be acceptable. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The  safety  assessment  focused  on  patients  with  type  2  diabetes,  who  were  treated  in  mostly 
randomised, double-blind trials. All patients treated with at least 1 dose of trial medication in any 
randomised  period  (i.e.  excluding  placebo  run-in  or  washout  periods)  were  included  in  the 
patient  set  evaluated  (TS,  treated  set).  This  application  is  supported  by  safety  data  from  48 
clinical trials, including 13 phase IIb/III trials, 5 dose-finding phase II trials, and 30 phase I trials 
(see  also  the  description  of  the  clinical  development  programme  above).  Some  phase  III  trials 
were still on-going at the time of the integrated analysis for this application (1245.25, 1245.28, 
1245.31).  For  these  trials,  all  safety  data  available  at  the  time  of  data  cut-off  for  the  pre-
specified interim analysis of each trial are included in this application. 
To better support an integrated analysis of safety, the trial data were pooled. Six poolings were 
devised  to  adequately  analyse  the  different  aspects  of  the  safety  profile  of  empagliflozin:  the 
pivotal phase  III trials (2 different poolings; SAF-2  and  SAF-3),  all monotherapy  trials (SAF-1), 
Assessment report

Page 66/99 
 
  
  
 
all trials in patients with type 2 diabetes (2 poolings; SAF-4 and SAF-5), and all trials in healthy 
subjects (SAF-6); for an overview. 
Patient exposure 
The  largest  pooling,  SAF-5  (all  patients),  included  12873  treated  patients,  of  which  8197  were 
treated with empagliflozin (10 mg: 3311 patients; 25 mg: 4285 patients; doses <10 mg [1 mg, 
2.5 mg, 5 mg]: 382 patients; doses > 25 mg [50 mg, 100 mg]: 219 patients). Of these, 4415 
patients were treated with empagliflozin for more than 52 weeks (10 and 25 mg only) and 1486 
patients for more than 76 weeks (10 and 25 mg only).  
Across all SAFs, exposure was lower in the placebo groups than in the empagliflozin groups (10 
mg or 25 mg). The higher exposure in the empagliflozin groups is a result of the generally higher 
discontinuation  rates  in  the  placebo  groups  in  the  different  trials,  and  of  the  trial  designs. 
Particularly,  trial  1245.28,  a  52-week  active  comparator  trial  without  a  placebo  control  and 
testing  only  the  25  mg  dose  of  empagliflozin,  contributed  to  the  exposure  differences  between 
treatment groups.  
In SAF-5 (all patients), mean and median exposure was similar in all treatment groups except 
placebo and empagliflozin 10 mg. The slightly higher exposure in the empagliflozin 25 mg and 
'all comparator' group can be explained by trial 1245.28, the active comparator trial contributing 
12% of all patients to SAF-5.

The analysis of adverse events was based on treatment-emergent adverse events, i.e. those with 
an  onset  between  the  first  and  the  last  intake  of  trial  medication  plus  7  days.  Adverse  event 
analyses  are  based on the number of patients with adverse events, not the number of adverse 
events. Adverse events were coded with the MedDRA coding dictionary, version 15.0.  
In  SAF-3  (pivotal  trials)  the  overall  frequency  of  patients  with  adverse  events  was  70.9%  ('all 
empa')  and  72.1%  ('all  comparators').  Frequencies  of  most  adverse  event  categories  were 
similar  between  groups.  However,  investigator-assessed  drug-related  adverse  events  had  a 
higher frequency in the 'all empa' group (21.3%) than the 'all comparators' group (16.2%).

A patient may be counted in more than 1 adverse event category 
In SAF-5 (all patients), about 70% of patients reported adverse events. Serious events and 
events of severe intensity were reported more frequently in the comparator groups than in the 
empagliflozin groups, and investigator-assessed drug-related events were reported more 
frequently in the empagliflozin groups than in the comparator groups, see Table . Adverse event 
frequencies in SAF-4 were very similar to those in SAF-5. 
The frequencies of adverse events of special interest were similar across treatments and across 
SAFs.  The  exceptions  were  confirmed  hypoglycaemia  and  genital  infection.  The  occurrence  of 
hypoglycaemia was linked to the antidiabetic background medication, with the lowest frequency 
of hypoglycaemic events in patients on monotherapy, and the highest frequency in patients who 
concomitantly received insulin. Genital infections were more frequent in the empagliflozin groups 
than in the comparator groups.

Most frequently reported adverse events 
The frequencies of patients with any adverse events were similar between treatment groups. The 
most common adverse events belonged to the MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) infections and 
infestations,  with  similar  frequencies  for  all  treatment  groups  in  all  SAFs  and  trials.  At  the 
MedDRA Preferred Term (PT) level, the most frequent events were nasopharyngitis (with similar 
frequencies  for  all  groups),  urinary  tract  infection  (with  similar  frequencies  for  all  groups), 
hyperglycaemia  (with  higher  frequencies  in  the  comparator  groups  than  in  the  empagliflozin 
groups),  and  hypoglycaemia  (with  higher  frequencies  in  the  empagliflozin  groups  than  in  the 
comparator groups). Differences between the 2 doses of empagliflozin (10 mg and 25 mg) were 
small  with  no  clear  distinction  between  the  2  doses.  Adverse  events  with  a  frequency  of  more 
than 5% in any treatment group are presented for SAF-3 in Table 13.

Adverse events leading to premature discontinuation of trial medication 
The proportion of patients with adverse events leading to discontinuation of trial medication was 
generally similar for all treatment groups. In most trials, the frequency of adverse events leading 
to discontinuation was numerically higher in the placebo group than in the empagliflozin groups. 
The  same  was  true  when  trials  were  pooled,  although  in  a  few  trials,  the  frequency  of  such 
events  was  lower  in  the  placebo  group  than  in  the  empagliflozin  groups.  In  SAF-5,  the 
proportions  of  patients  who  discontinued  due  to  adverse  events  were  almost  identical  between 
the  empagliflozin  doses  (4.8%  for  empagliflozin  10  mg,  4.9%  for  empagliflozin  25  mg).  When 
adjusting  for  exposure,  the  incidence  rates  (events  per  100  patients  years)  across  SAFs  were 
consistently  highest  in  the  placebo  groups  and  lowest  in  the  empagliflozin  10  mg  or  25  mg

vs Placebo: 0.54 [0.18, 1.62]; HR [95%CI] pooled Empa vs Placebo: 0.45 [0.17, 1.23]). 
Adverse events of special interest 
Based on scientific considerations and regulatory advice, the largest pooling (SAF-5, all patients) 
was searched for events of special interest.  
Hypoglycaemic events 
Hypoglycaemia  was  thoroughly  monitored  in  all  clinical  trials.  A  hypoglycaemic  event  was 
considered 'confirmed' if the plasma glucose level was ≤70 mg/dL or when the patient required 
the  assistance  of  another  person,  and  the  event  was  considered  'severe'  when  the  patient 
required  the  assistance  of  another  person.  The  analysis  presented  here  is  based  on  confirmed 
hypoglycaemic adverse events. 
The  analysis  showed  that  treatment  with  empagliflozin  did  not  lead  to  an  increase  of 
hypoglycaemic  events  in  most  trials.  For  trials  in  patients  with  metformin  and  sulphonylurea 
background  medication,  the  frequencies  of  confirmed  hypoglycaemic  events  were  higher  in  the 
empagliflozin groups than in the placebo groups.

Severe  hypoglycaemic  adverse  events  (assistance  of  another  person  required)  were  very 
infrequent.  In  the  pivotal  trials  and in  trial  1245.48,  severe  events  were  not  reported  at  all.  In 
trial  1245.28  (background  medication:  metformin),  1  case  (0.1%)  was  reported  in  the 
glimepiride  group.  In  trial  1245.33  (background  medication:  basal  insulin  ±  metformin  ± 
sulphonylurea),  2  cases  (1.3%)  were  reported  in  the  empagliflozin  25  mg  group.  In  trials 
1245.36  (renal  impairment;  any  background  medication)  and  (1245.36:  placebo:  1.9%, 
empagliflozin 10 mg: 1.0%, empagliflozin 25 mg: 1.6%). 
Cardiovascular events 
To investigate the cardiovascular safety of empagliflozin treatment, a pre-specified meta-analysis 
was  performed.  The  primary  endpoint  of  this  analysis  was  the  composite  4-point  MACE  (major 
adverse cardiovascular events) endpoint, which consisted of cardiovascular death (including fatal 
stroke  and  fatal  myocardial  infarction),  non-fatal  myocardial  infarction,  non-fatal  stroke,  and 
hospitalisation due  to unstable angina.  All  events were centrally adjudicated by an independent 
adjudication committee that was blinded to the treatment allocation of patients.

The meta-analysis  of the pooled placebo-controlled Phase  III trials with a treatment  duration > 
12  weeks  (1245.19,  1245.20,  1245.23  (met),  1245.23  (met+SU),  1245.31,  1245.33,  1245.36, 
excluding 1245.25 [CVOT] and 1245.28 [H2H vs glimepiride]) included 1314 patients on placebo 
and 2395 patients on all empagliflozin (1098 patients on empagliflozin 10 mg, and 1297 patients 
on empagliflozin 25 mg). For the primary endpoint based on the treated set, the incidence was 
1.98% for the placebo group (26 patients with event) and 0.92% in the all empagliflozin group 
(22  patients  with  event),  with  an  incidence  rate  of  22.2  events  (placebo)  vs  9.8  events  (all 
empagliflozin) per 1000 years at risk. The hazard ratio (HR) [95% CI] based on Cox regression 
of all empagliflozin vs placebo was 0.48 [0.27, 0.85]. 
Urinary tract infection 
Urinary tract infections were identified as possible risks in the phase III protocols and respective 
patient information  leaflets,  but  infections  did  not  have  to  be  specifically  monitored  or  followed 
up on the case report form.  
Across all trials and SAFs, the frequencies of urinary tract infection (BIcMQ) were similar for all 
treatment groups, as were the exposure-adjusted incidence rates. For the pooling of all patients 
(SAF  5),  the  overall  frequency  of  urinary  tract  infection  was  8.1%  for  the  placebo  group 
(incidence  rate  per  100  patient  years:  10.9),  8.9%  (10.5)  for  the  empagliflozin  10  mg  group, 
8.8% (9.6) for the empagliflozin 25 mg group, and 8.1% (9.6) for the 'all comparators' group. 
Very  few  patients  reported  events  of  severe  intensity  (≤0.3%  per  group  in  SAF-5)  or  events 
requiring  or  prolonging  hospitalisation  (≤0.4%  per  group).  Cases  of  acute  pyelonephritis, 
urosepsis, and sepsis with a possible urinary tract source of sepsis (and not previously reported 
as PT urosepsis) were very rare, with similar frequencies across treatment groups.  
As  would  be  expected,  the  proportion  of  patients  who  had  urinary  tract  infection  was  higher  in 
patients with a history of chronic or recurrent urinary tract infections at baseline, than in patients 
without  such  a  history  (patients  with  history:  'all  empa':  26.9%,  'all  comparators':  24.2%; 
patients without history: 'all empa': 7.8%, 'all comparators': 7.7%).  
The time of onset of UTI in the empagliflozin groups is shorter than in the placebo group during 
the first 80 days, most likely due to symptomatic UTIs. 
The Applicant has included urinary tract infections as an important identified risk in the RMP.  As 
a proactive step to ensure patient safety, the Applicant proposes a PASS to evaluate the risk of 
UTI in empagliflozin-treated patients. 
Genital infection 
Genital infections had been mentioned as possible risks in the phase III protocols and respective 
patient information  leaflets,  but  infections  did  not  have  to  be  specifically  monitored  or  followed 
up  on  the  case  report  form.  Across  all  trials  and  SAFs,  the  frequencies  of  genital  infection 
(BIcMQ)  were  consistently  higher  in  the  empagliflozin  groups  than  in  the  comparator  groups 
(SAF-5:  placebo:  1.0%;  empagliflozin  10  mg:  4.4%;  empagliflozin  25  mg:  4.7%,  'all 
comparators': 1.1%), for both absolute frequencies and exposure-adjusted incidence rates.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/137741/2014 
Page 75/99 
 
  
  
The proportion of patients who had genital infection was approximately 2-fold higher for women 
than for men, irrespective of the treatment group. In both genders, patients in the empagliflozin 
groups  had  a  4-fold  higher  rate  of  genital  infections  than  patients  in  the  comparator  groups 
(women:  'all  empa':  6.9%,  'all  comparators':  1.7%;  men:  'all  empa':  3.3%,  'all  comparators': 
0.7%).  
The Applicant has included genital infections as an important identified risk in the updated RMP. 
As a proactive step to ensure patient safety, the Applicant proposes a PASS to evaluate the risk 
of genital infection in empagliflozin-treated patients. 
Volume depletion 
There  was  no  special  exclusion  criterion  for  patients  at  risk  for  volume  depletion  in  the  trial 
protocols.  The  risk  for  blood  pressure  lowering  and  fluid  loss  had  been  mentioned  in  phase  III 
protocols  and  the  patient  information  leaflets,  but  there  was  no  special  reporting  or  follow-up 
required for adverse events possibly caused by volume depletion.  
Across all trials, the frequencies of volume depletion were very low and similar for all treatment 
groups  (SAF-5:  placebo:  1.4%;  empagliflozin  10  mg:  1.4%;  empagliflozin  25  mg:  1.5%,  'all 
comparators':  1.2%),  for  both  absolute  frequencies  and  exposure-adjusted  incidence  rates  per 
100 patient  years.  In  SAF-5  (all  patients),  the  most  common  adverse  events were  hypotension 
('all  empa':  0.6%;  'all  comparator':  0.7%)  and  syncope  ('all  empa':  0.5%;  'all  comparator': 
0.3%).  
For  patients  taking  any  types  of  diuretics  at  baseline,  the  frequency  for  volume  depletion  was 
about  twice  as  high  as  for  those  not  taking  diuretics  at  baseline.  In  patients  using  diuretics, 
frequency for volume depletion was slightly higher for patients using empagliflozin compared to 
comparators  (SAF-5:  patients  with  diuretics  use  at  baseline:  placebo:  2.2%,  empagliflozin  10 
mg: 2.5%, empagliflozin 25 mg: 2.7%; 'all comparators': 2.2%; patients without diuretics use at 
baseline:  placebo:  1.0%;  empagliflozin  10  mg:  0.9%,  empagliflozin  25  mg:  0.9%;  'all 
comparators':  2.1%).  The  same  was  true  for  patients  taking  loop  diuretics  at  baseline  (SAF-5: 
patients  with  loop  diuretics  use  at  baseline:  placebo:  2.9%,  empagliflozin  10  mg:  4.9%, 
empagliflozin  25  mg:  3.0%;  'all  comparators':  2.8%;  patients  without  loop  diuretics  use  at 
baseline  placebo:  1.2%,  empagliflozin  10  mg:  1.2%,  empagliflozin  25  mg:  1.3%,  'all 
comparators': 1.1%). 
The frequency of volume depletion increased with age and renal impairment. For most age and 
renal  impairment  categories,  the  frequencies  were  comparable  in  the  empagliflozin  and  the 
comparator groups. The frequency of volume depletion was higher in the empagliflozin groups for 
the age category 75 years and older (SAF 5: placebo: 5 patients, 2.1%; empagliflozin 10 mg: 5 
patients; 2.3%; empagliflozin 25 mg: 12 patients; 4.4%). 
Decreased renal function 
Decreased  renal  function  was  a  pre-specified  event  in  the  phase  III  trial  protocols.  The 
frequencies of decreased renal function (SMQ) were very low for all SAFs. In SAF-5 (all patients), 
the frequency was 1.0% in the placebo group, 1.1% in the 10 mg empagliflozin group, 1.3% in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/137741/2014 
Page 76/99 
 
  
  
the  25  mg  empagliflozin  group,  and  0.9%  in  the  'all  comparators'  group.  The  most  common 
adverse event was renal impairment, reported with higher frequency in the empagliflozin groups 
(placebo:  0.5%,  empagliflozin  10  mg:  0.7%,  empagliflozin  25  mg:  0.7%;  'all  comparators': 
0.4%).  
A similar percentage of patients in all groups were reported with serum creatinine ≥2x baseline 
and  above  the  ULN.  There  was  no  clinically  meaningful  change  from  baseline  in  mean  eGFR 
values in any treatment group. Empagliflozin groups showed a small initial decrease in eGFR, but 
the  levels  gradually  increased  over  time.  In  trials  with  a  longer  follow  up  period  after  the  last 
dose  of  trial  medication,  eGFR  returned  to  baseline  levels  within  2  to  3  weeks  after 
discontinuation of empagliflozin.  
Hepatic injury 
Hepatic injury was a pre-specified event in the phase III trial protocols. There was no evidence of 
an  increased  risk  of  hepatic  injuries  for  patients  treated  with  empagliflozin;  the  frequencies  of 
hepatic  injury  (SMQ)  were  very  low  and  similar  for  all  treatment  groups,  for  both  absolute 
frequencies  and  exposure-adjusted  incidence  rates.  In  SAF-5  (all  patients),  the  frequency  was 
1.5%  in  the  placebo  group,  1.2%  in  the  10  mg  empagliflozin  group,  1.4%  in  the  25  mg 
empagliflozin group, and 1.9% in the 'all comparators' group. The most common adverse events 
were hepatic steatosis, increased ALT, and increased AST. Hyperbilirubinaemia was reported with 
higher frequency in the empagliflozin 25 mg group (empagliflozin 10 mg: <0.1%; empagliflozin 
25  mg:  0.2%;  'all  comparators':  0%);  all  other  events  were  generally  balanced  across  the 
groups 
Assessments for drug-induced liver injuries (DILI) were made according to the FDA guideline on 
the evaluation of DILI. A total of 7 patients had laboratory values consistent with a biochemical 
Hy's  law  laboratory  constellation  (ALT  or  AST  ≥3x  ULN  with  concomitant  or  subsequent  total 
bilirubin ≥2x ULN within 30 days and with the maximum  alkaline phosphatase  value in the 30-
day  period  <2x  ULN):  2  patients  in  the  empagliflozin  10  mg  group,  3  patients  in  the 
empagliflozin  25  mg  group,  1  patient  post-treatment  in  the  empagliflozin  25  mg  group,  and  1 
patient during the screening period. These cases did, however, not qualify for drug-induced liver 
injury  (according  to  Hy's  law)  because  plausible  alternative  aetiologies  for  hepatic  dysfunction 
were  present  in  the  patients'  medical  history,  concomitant  diagnoses,  or  concomitant  therapy 
(for instance hepatitis, pancreatic cancer, or liver cirrhosis). 
A total of 4 patients had elevated ALT or AST levels (≥3x ULN) with a concomitant or subsequent 
increase in total bilirubin ≥2x ULN within  30  days, but with the maximum  alkaline phosphatase 
value  in  the  30-day  period  >2x  ULN:  1  patient  in  the  empagliflozin  10  mg  group,  2  patients  in 
the  empagliflozin  25  mg  group,  and  1  patient  in  the  glimepiride  group.  Plausible  alternative 
aetiologies were present in the patients' medical history, concomitant diagnoses, or concomitant 
therapy.  
Additionally, a total of 7 patients had ALT or AST values ≥10x ULN not associated with elevated 
bilirubin  levels:  4  patients  in  the  empagliflozin  25  mg  group,  1  patient  post-treatment  in  the 
empagliflozin 100 mg group, 1 patient post-treatment in the placebo group, and 1 patient during 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/137741/2014 
Page 77/99 
 
  
  
the  screening  period.  Again,  plausible  alternative  aetiologies  were  present  in  the  patients' 
medical history, concomitant diagnoses, or concomitant therapy.  
During the registration process, it became clear that the number of patients with serious hepatic 
adverse  events  is  remarkably  higher  in  the  empagliflozin  groups  compared  to  placebo  and 
comparators. 22  patients are  reported with  serious liver enzyme elevation (ALT/AST >=3x ULN 
with  total  bilirubin  >=2x  ULN  or  ALT/AST  >=10x  ULN)  during  or  after  treatment.  Of  these  22 
patients 19 were reported during or after treatment with empagliflozin, whereas no cases were 
reported  during  treatment  with  placebo  and  only  2  cases  were  reported  after  treatment  with 
placebo. One case was reported during treatment with glimepiride. In all but one of these cases 
the  independent  committee  of  hepatic  experts  judged  that  the  causal  relationship  with  the 
treatment  was  not  probable.  The  occurrence  of  serious  liver  enzyme  elevations  was  low  and 
there were no imbalances unfavourable for empagliflozin in less severe signs of liver impairment 
(ALT and/or AST ≥3x ULN or total bilirubin ≥2x ULN). There was, however, a slight imbalance for 
elevations of ALT and/or  AST ≥ 5x ULN (0.1% for  placebo and 0.2% for both empa 10 and 25 
mg). A higher frequency was seen for ALT and/or AST ≥ 10x ULN and ≥ 20x ULN. 
The  frequency  of  patients  with  elevated  liver  enzymes  during  the  treatment  period  was  not 
importantly  influenced  by  history  of  liver  or  pancreatic  disease  at  baseline  or  not.  This  means 
that  the  risk  of  liver  injury  cannot  be  diminished  by  limiting  the  use  of  empagliflozin  to 
individuals without a history of liver or pancreatic disease. 
Bone fracture 
Bone fractures reported as adverse events 
Bone  fracture  (BIcMQ)  was  evaluated  because  of  regulatory  concerns  with  another  drug  of  the 
same  class  (a  numerical  imbalance  for  bone  fractures  in  patients  with  renal  impairment).  The 
search  included  59  PTs  of  fractures.  In  SAF-5  (all  patients),  the  frequency  was  1.6%  in  the 
placebo group, 1.6% in the 10 mg empagliflozin group, 1.1% in the 25 mg empagliflozin group, 
and  1.5%  in  the  'all  comparators'  group.  Calcium,  phosphate,  and  alkaline  phosphatase  were 
assessed  in  all  trials;  25-OH-vitamin  D,  intact  parathyroid  hormone,  and  urine  N-terminal 
telopeptide  (NTx)  were  assessed  only  in  trials  1245.20,  1245.28,  1245.33,  and  1245.38.  No 
clinically  meaningful  changes  in  the  median  values  were  observed  for  vitamin  D,  intact 
parathyroid  hormone,  calcium,  phosphate,  and  alkaline  phosphatase.  Urine  NTx  to  creatinine 
ratio  increased  slightly  in  the  empagliflozin  groups,  whereas  it  decreased  slightly  in  the 
comparator groups. In trial 1245.28, for a small subgroup of patients (48 patients in the 25 mg 
empagliflozin  group  and  38  patients  in  the  glimepiride  group),  bone  mineral  density  was 
assessed based on T-scores of femoral neck or lumbar spine. No clinically meaningful change was 
observed in either the empagliflozin 25 mg or the glimepiride group after 52 weeks of treatment. 
Malignancy 
Events  were  analysed  including  either  all  malignancies  (independent  of  onset  date),  or  only 
events  with  an  onset  later  than  6  months  of  exposure.  For  both  analyses,  the  frequencies  of 
malignancy were very low and similar for all treatment groups, for both absolute frequencies and 
exposure-adjusted incidence rates. In SAF-5 (all patients), some imbalances between treatment 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/137741/2014 
Page 78/99 
 
  
  
groups occurred on PT level, but the frequency of patients with malignancies (onset later than 6 
months) was 0.5% in the placebo group, 0.6% in the 10 mg empagliflozin group, 0.5% in the 25 
mg empagliflozin group, and 0.5% in the 'all comparator' group.  
The  Applicant  was  requested  to  discuss  all  the  observed  cases  for  malignant  melanoma,  renal 
cancer  and  bladder  cancer  in  more  detail.  Based  on  the  answers  it  is  concluded  that  a  urinary 
tract carcinogenic risk cannot be ruled out and thus should be further monitored and studied in 
view  of  the  observation  in  male  mice  in  the  pre-clinical  studies  (i.e.  it  cannot  be  excluded  that 
the  4-OH  CTA  metabolite  is  absent  in  humans  as  it  hasn’t  been  quantified  directly).  Therefore, 
urinary tract malignancies monitoring through routine PhVig activities for an important potential 
risk in the RMP is considered appropriate. For malignant melanoma the imbalance in the number 
of cases remains a concern. However, in the absence of a mechanistic rationale and non-clinical 
findings  for  malignant  melanoma,  routine  PhVig  activities  in  the  RMP  is  considered  appropriate 
because currently there is a lack of long term data. 
Laboratory findings 
For  most  safety  laboratory  parameters,  the  analyses  showed  no  clear  trends  that  were 
considered  clinically  meaningful.  Across  most  trials  and  poolings,  small  increases  in  lipid 
parameters  were  seen  in  all  treatment  groups.  The  increase  was  more  pronounced  for  the 
empagliflozin  groups  than  for  the  placebo  and  comparator  groups  for  total  cholesterol,  HDL 
cholesterol,  and  LDL  cholesterol.  The  placebo-corrected  mean  change  from  baseline  after  24 
weeks  of  treatment  was  between  0.06  mmol/L  and  0.09  mmol/L  for  both  LDL  and  HDL 
cholesterol (SAF-3, pivotal trials with extensions). For the LDL/HDL ratio and for triglycerides, no 
clinically meaningful differences were found between treatment groups.  
In line with the efficacy analysis, the safety analysis of the change in diastolic and systolic blood 
pressure from  baseline to last value on  treatment showed  decreases in the empagliflozin group 
and no change in the placebo and the comparator groups, across all SAFs and trials. The median 
pulse  rate  at  the  end  of  treatment  showed  no  change  from  baseline  for  all  treatment  groups 
across all SAFs and trials. 
Safety in special populations 
Age 
Only subjects at least 18 years of age were enrolled in all clinical trials. Although there had not 
been an age restriction for elderly patients, only 29 patients older than 85 years were treated in 
clinical trials. Therefore this age category was included in  the ≥75  years category  for subgroup 
analyses. The following age subgroups were assessed for SAF-5 (all patients): 2055 patients <50 
years,  6857  patients  from  50  to  <65  years,  3404  patients  from  65  to  <75  years,  and  760 
patients 75 years or older. 
Generally,  the  frequency  of  adverse  events  (all  types)  increased  with  age.  For  most  types  of 
adverse  events,  the  frequencies  were  comparable  in  the  empagliflozin  and  the  comparators 
groups,  for  each  age  category.  Exceptions  were  as  follows.  The  frequency  of  genital  infections 
(BIcMQ) was higher in the empagliflozin groups for all age categories. The frequency of urinary 
Assessment report

tract infection (BIcMQ) was higher in the empagliflozin groups for the age categories 65 to <75 
years  (SAF-5:  placebo:  73  patients,  7.5%;  empagliflozin  10  mg:  87  patients,  8.9%; 
empagliflozin  25  mg:  130  patients,  10.7%)  and  for  the  age  group  75  years  and  older  (SAF-5: 
placebo: 25 patients, 10.5%; empagliflozin 10 mg: 34 patients; 15.7%; empagliflozin 25 mg: 41 
patients;  15.1%).  The  frequency  of  volume  depletion  was  higher  in  the  empagliflozin  25  mg 
group for the age categories 75 years and older (SAF 5: placebo: 5 patients, 2.1%; empagliflozin 
10 mg: 5 patients; 2.3%; empagliflozin 25 mg: 12 patients; 4.4%). The frequency of decreased 
renal  function  was  slightly  higher  in  the  empagliflozin  25  mg  group  for  the  age  categories  75 
years and older. The frequency of serious adverse events was lower in the empagliflozin groups 
for the age categories 65 years and older. 
A  post-hoc  analysis  was  conducted  to  investigate  whether  the  observed  imbalances  in  adverse 
event  frequencies  for  volume  depletion  and  urinary  tract infection in  patients ≥75  years  of  age 
were associated with decreased renal function. The analysis was performed in the largest pooling 
(SAF-5,  all  patients).  The  higher  frequency  of  volume  depletion  in  the  empagliflozin  groups 
compared  with  the  placebo  group  was  still  observed  in  all  subcategories,  independent  of  renal 
function  category.  The  frequency  of  urinary  tract  infections  in  patients  ≥75  years  and  treated 
with  empagliflozin  seems  to  be  at  least  partially  associated  with  declining  renal  function:  in 
patients  with  baseline  eGFR  ≥45  or  ≥60  mL/min/1.73  m2,  the  frequency  of  urinary  tract 
infections tended to be comparable between the empagliflozin and the placebo groups, whereas 
in  the  matching  lower  eGFR  categories,  frequencies  were  increased  in  the  empagliflozin  groups 
compared with the placebo group. 
Gender, BMI, race ethnicity and region 
There were no important effects of gender, BMI, race ethnicity and region on the adverse events 
with empagliflozin.  
Renal impairment 
The frequency of patients with any adverse events, serious adverse events, and adverse events 
leading  to  discontinuation  of  trial  medication  increased  with  the  degree  of  renal  impairment. 
However,  the  frequencies  were  similar  between  the  empagliflozin  and  comparator  treatment 
groups of each renal  impairment category.  For decreased renal function (SMQ) genital infection 
and urinary tract infection (BIcMQ), frequencies increased with the degree of renal impairment, 
and were higher in empagliflozin treatment groups than in comparator groups in the categories 
of patients with moderate renal impairment.  
The estimated GFR and the urine-albumin-to-creatinine ratio were analysed by renal impairment 
subgroups.  The  mean  eGFR  change  from  baseline  to  last  value  on  treatment  was  small  and 
similar  for  all  treatment  groups  among  patients  with  eGFR  ≥60  mL/min/1.73  m2.  For  patients 
with  moderate  or  severe  renal  impairment,  the  mean  and  median  eGFR  decreased  in  the 
empagliflozin  groups,  while  it  increased  in  the  comparator  groups.  The  decrease  of  eGFR  after 
empagliflozin  treatment  was  also  observed  in  the  dedicated  renal  impairment  trial  (1245.36); 
however, 3 weeks after the end of  treatment, eGFR returned  to  baseline levels in  patients with 
mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment. This is similar to other SGLT2 inhibitors.

Patients with HbA1c above 10% treated with open-label empagliflozin  
In  the  open-label  empagliflozin  25  mg  group,  63.0%  of  patients  reported  at  least  1  adverse 
event  (double-blind  25  mg  empagliflozin  in  SAF-2:  59.7%),  3.5%  reported  serious  adverse 
events  (double-blind  25  mg  empagliflozin  in  SAF-2:  2.6%),  3.5%  adverse  events  leading  to 
discontinuation  of  trial  medication  (double-blind  25  mg  empagliflozin  in  SAF-2:  2.3%),  1.9% 
events  of  severe  intensity  (double-blind  25  mg  empagliflozin  in  SAF-2:  3.0%),  and  16% 
investigator-defined  drug-related  adverse  events  (double-blind  25  mg  empagliflozin  in  SAF-2: 
16.0%). No death was reported in the open-label empagliflozin 25 mg group.  
The frequencies of patients with adverse events of special interest were generally very low in the 
open-label  empagliflozin  25  mg  group.  Nine  patients  (3.5%)  had  confirmed  hypoglycaemic 
events (plasma glucose value of ≤70 mg/dL or where assistance was required). The frequency of 
urinary  tract  infections  (BIcMQ)  was  4.3%.  Four  patients  (1.6%)  were  reported  with  genital 
infections  (BIcMQ).  Two  patients  were  reported  with  volume  depletion  (BIcMQ)  and  3  patients 
with  bone  fractures  (BIcMQ).  Two  patients  were  reported  with  decreased  renal  function  (SMQ), 
and 2 with hepatic injury (SMQ). One patient was reported with ALT or AST ≥5x ULN. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Trial  data  were  pooled  to  adequately  analyse  the  different  aspects  of  the  safety  profile  of 
empagliflozin. The  most relevant safety pooling  for the benefit-risk  assessment of empagliflozin 
is SAF-3 as this pooling corresponds to the pivotal trials with extensions (2957 patients in total). 
However, rare events and subgroups were assessed based on the largest available pooling, which 
included all 12873 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated in trials with empagliflozin (SAF-
5).  The  overall  exposure  to  empagliflozin  (10  or  25  mg)  was  1546  patient  years  (median 
treatment duration 369 days) in SAF-3 and 7828 patient years (median treatment duration 364 
days) in SAF-5.  
The  frequencies  of  premature  discontinuation  of  trial  medication  were  higher  in  the  placebo 
group  than  in  the  empagliflozin  groups  (SAF-3:  placebo:  17.1%;  empagliflozin  10  mg:  10.8%; 
empagliflozin 25 mg: 12.8%). The overall frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events was 
comparable  between  treatment  groups  (SAF-3:  placebo:  74.1%;  empagliflozin  10  mg:  71.8%; 
empagliflozin 25 mg: 70.1%). Investigator-assessed drug-related events were more frequent in 
the empagliflozin treatment groups than in the placebo group, whereas adverse events of severe 
intensity  were  more  frequent  in  the  placebo  group.  The  frequencies  of  patients  with  serious 
adverse  events  (including  fatal  events)  in  the  empagliflozin  groups  were  lower  than  in  the 
placebo group in the pivotal trials with extensions (SAF-3: placebo: 7.4%; empagliflozin 10 mg: 
7.1%; empagliflozin 25 mg: 5.8%).  
The most frequent events were nasopharyngitis (with similar frequencies for all groups), urinary 
tract infection (with similar frequencies for all groups), hyperglycaemia (with higher frequencies 
in  the  comparator  groups  than  in  the  empagliflozin  groups),  and  hypoglycaemia  (with  higher 
frequencies in the empagliflozin groups than in the comparator groups). 
Hypoglycaemia 
As  could  be  expected,  there  was  more  hyperglycaemia  and  less  hypoglycaemia  with  placebo 
compared to empagliflozin. There was an increase in the number of hypoglycaemic episodes with 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/137741/2014 
Page 81/99 
 
  
  
empagliflozin in combination with MET+SU. In patients using other oral antihyperglycaemic drugs 
or  insulin  as  background  therapy,  empagliflozin  was  not  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of 
hypoglycaemia. 
Cardiovascular risk 
There were small increases in LDL cholesterol with empagliflozin. However, HDL levels were also 
somewhat  increased.  In  the  cardiovascular  pooled  analyses,  empagliflozin  is  compared  to 
placebo. Although the follow-up is short and the numbers are small, this comparison tends to be 
in  favour  of  empagliflozin.  The  incidence  rate  was  also  lower  for  the  all  empagliflozin  group 
compared to the placebo group. 
Urinary tract infections and genital infections  
Urinary  tract  infections  and  genital  infections  were  classified  as  adverse  events  of  special 
interest.  In  accordance,  these  infections  were  identified  as  possible  risks  in  the  phase  III 
protocols  and  respective  patient  information  leaflets.  However,  infections  did  not  have  to  be 
specifically  monitored  or  followed  up  on  the  case  report  form.  As  these  infections  were  not 
monitored specifically, the presented results may be unreliable. A wide list of PTs was analysed. 
Results  show  that  there  was  an  increased  risk  of  genital  infections.  On  average,  there  was  no 
increased  risk  of  urinary  tract  infections.  However,  in  patients  with  a  history  of  urinary  tract 
infections,  empagliflozin  was  associated  with  a  higher  risk  of  urinary  tract  infections  (with 
history: 'all empa': 26.9%, 'all comparators': 24.2%; patients without history: 'all empa': 7.8%, 
'all comparators': 7.7%). 
Hepatic injuries 
Although  it  was  not  expected  that  empagliflozin  would  be  associated  with  hepatic  injuries,  it 
became  clear  during  the  registration  process,  that  the  number  of  patients  with  serious  hepatic 
adverse  events  is  remarkably  higher  in  the  empagliflozin  groups  compared  to  placebo  and 
comparators.  22  patients  are  reported  with  serious  liver  enzyme  elevation  during  or  after 
treatment.  Of  these  22  patients 19  were  reported  during  or  after  treatment with  empagliflozin, 
whereas no cases were reported during treatment with placebo and only 2 cases were reported 
after treatment with placebo. One case was reported during treatment with glimepiride. In all but 
one  of  these  cases  the  independent  committee  of  hepatic  experts  judged  that  the  causal 
relationship  with  the  treatment  was  not  probable.  The  occurrence  of  serious  liver  enzyme 
elevations  was  low  and  there  were  no  imbalances  unfavourable  for  empagliflozin  in  less  severe 
signs of liver impairment. 
The  frequency  of  patients  with  elevated  liver  enzymes  during  the  treatment  period  was  not 
importantly  influenced  by  history  of  liver  or  pancreatic  disease  at  baseline  or  not.  This  means 
that  the  risk  of  liver  injury  cannot  be  diminished  by  limiting  the  use  of  empagliflozin  to 
individuals without a history of liver or pancreatic disease. 
Bone fractures 
Bone fractures were of special interest, but not identified as a possible risk. The reported rates of 
bone  fracture  were  very  low  and  similar  for  all  treatment  groups.  Changes  in  BMD  were  not 
found.  However,  treatment  duration  was  too  short  (1  year)  and  the  numbers  of  patients  very 
small (48 treated with empagliflozin). In addition, urine NTx to creatinine ratio increased slightly 
in  the  empagliflozin  groups,  whereas  it  decreased  slightly  in  the  comparator  groups.  Harmful 
effects of empagliflozin cannot be excluded. In the PRAC-rapport the necessity for a PASS will be 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/137741/2014 
Page 82/99 
 
  
  
discussed.  In  case  of  PASS,  it  is  adviced  to  include  bone  fracture  incidence  in  the  PASS.  For 
comparison, also with Dapagliflozin BMD measurements were asked in a subset of patients in the 
CV outcome study in order to obtain more data on bone metabolism. 
Malignancies 
There  was  no  clear  pattern  with  respect  to  the  occurrence  of  malignancies.  With  empagliflozin, 
there  were  more  cases  of  bladder  cancer  compared  to  comparators  (empagliflozin  2  cases, 
comparators  0  cases),  but  fewer  cases  of  breast  cancer  (empagliflozin  1  case,  comparators  2 
cases).  It  is  likely  that  these  differences  do  not  represent  a  causal  association,  but  are  due  to 
numerical  imbalances.  The  urinary  tract  carcinogenic  risk  cannot  be  ruled  out  and  should  be 
further monitored and  studied  in view of the  finding  in male  mice  in  the  preclinical  studies and 
conclusive  evidence  that  the  involved  4-OH  CTA  metabolite  is  absent  in  humans.  This  can  be 
done with additional PhVig activities in the RMP. 
Kidney 
There  were  no  relevant  changes  in  creatinine  levels.  Overall,  frequencies  of  decreased  renal 
function  and  volume  depletion  reported  as  adverse  events  were  similar.  In  animals,  renal 
calcifications  were  observed.  The  risk  of  kidney  stones  in  humans  is  unknown.  The  Applicant 
should analyse the occurrence of kidney stones in the development programme.  
Subgroups 
There were no important effects of gender, BMI, race ethnicity and region on the adverse events 
with empagliflozin.  
Exposure to empagliflozin increased with the degree of renal impairment. Patients with different 
degrees  of  renal  impairment  were  analysed  separately.  The  frequency  of  patients  with  any 
adverse  events,  serious  adverse  events,  and  adverse  events  leading  to  discontinuation  of  trial 
medication increased with the degree of renal impairment. Importantly, empagliflozin treatment 
was associated with a higher frequency of decreased renal function, genital infection and urinary 
tract  infection  in  patients  with  moderate  renal  impairment.  Therefore,  empagliflozin  cannot  be 
recommended  to  patients  with  moderate  renal  impairment.  In  addition,  in  the  subgroup  of 
patients  using  diuretics,  frequency  for  volume  depletion  was  slightly  higher  for  patients  using 
empagliflozin compared to comparators (patients with diuretics use at baseline: placebo: 2.2%, 
empagliflozin 10 mg: 2.5%, empagliflozin 25 mg: 2.7%; 'all comparators': 2.2%). The same was 
true  for  patients  taking  loop  diuretics  at  baseline  (patients  with  loop  diuretics  use  at  baseline: 
placebo:  2.9%,  empagliflozin  10  mg:  4.9%,  empagliflozin  25  mg:  3.0%;  'all  comparators': 
2.8%). Therefore, caution should be exercised in patients on diuretics. This should be mentioned 
in the SmPC. 
Different  age  groups  were  analysed  separately.  There  was  a  higher  frequency  of  urinary  tract 
infections,  volume  depletion  and  decreased  renal  function  in  patients  ≥75  years.  In  elderly 
patients, the frequency of urinary tract infection was higher in the empagliflozin groups especially 
for the age group 75 years and older (SAF-5: placebo: 25 patients, 10.5%; empagliflozin 10 mg: 
34 patients; 15.7%; empagliflozin 25 mg: 41 patients; 15.1%). However, the higher frequency 
of urinary tract infection in patients >75 years with empagliflozin may be explained by declining 
renal  function:  in  patients  >75  years  with  baseline  eGFR  ≥45  or  ≥60  mL/min/1.73  m2,  the 
frequency of urinary tract infections tended to be comparable between the empagliflozin and the 
placebo  groups,  whereas  in  the  matching lower  eGFR  categories,  frequencies were  increased  in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/137741/2014 
Page 83/99 
 
  
  
the  empagliflozin  groups  compared  with  the  placebo  group.  These  data  suggest  that  renal 
function is a determinant of urinary tract infections in patients ≥75 years. The increased risk of 
volume  depletion  in  patients  ≥75  years  with  empagliflozin  is  an  important  issue  (placebo:  5 
patients,  2.1%;  empagliflozin  10  mg:  5  patients;  2.3%;  empagliflozin  25  mg:  12  patients; 
4.4%).  Subgroup  analyses  demonstrated  that  this  higher  frequency  was  independent  of  renal 
function  category.  The  frequency  of  decreased  renal  function  was  slightly  higher  in  the 
empagliflozin 25 mg group for the age  categories 75 years and older (4 patients (1.7%) in the 
placebo group vs. 6 patients (2.2%) for empagliflozin 25 mg). Taken together, caution should be 
exercised in elderly patients. This is adequately reflected in the product information. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included 
in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Although  genital  and  urinary  infections  were  not  monitored  specifically,  the  presented  results 
show that there was an increased risk of genital infections with empagliflozin. 
In  patients  with  moderate  renal  impairment,  empagliflozin  treatment  was  associated  with  a 
higher  frequency  of  decreased  renal  function,  genital  infection  and  urinary  tract  infection. 
Therefore, empagliflozin cannot be recommended in patients with moderate renal impairment. 
There was a  higher frequency of  urinary  tract infections, volume depletion and decreased renal 
function  in  patients  ≥75  years.  Subgroup  analyses  demonstrated  that  this  higher  frequency  of 
volume  depletion  was  independent  of  renal  function  category.  Empagliflozin  cannot  be 
recommended in patients >75 years. 
There  was  an  increase  in  the  number  of  hypoglycaemic  episodes  with  empagliflozin  in 
combination with MET+SU. This risk should be clearly mentioned in the SmPC. 
Although  it  was  not  expected  that  empagliflozin  would  be  associated  with  hepatic  injuries,  the 
number  of  patients  with  serious  hepatic  adverse  events  was  remarkably  higher  in  the 
empagliflozin  groups  compared  to  placebo  and  comparators.  In  all  but  one  of  these  cases  the 
independent committee of hepatic experts judged that the causal relationship with the treatment 
was not probable. The occurrence of serious liver enzyme elevations was low and there were no 
imbalances unfavourable for empagliflozin in less severe signs of liver impairment. 
No effects on bone mineral density and bone fractures were found. However, treatment duration 
was too short and the numbers of patients very small. Harmful effects of empagliflozin cannot be 
excluded. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils 
the legislative requirements.    
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/137741/2014 
Page 84/99 
 
  
  
2.8.  Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP received a PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan in which there 
were outstanding issues regarding the proposed safety specification, pharmacovigilance plan, 
as well as the proposed risk minimisation measures.  
The CHMP endorsed this advice with changes. 
These changes concerned the following elements of the Risk Management Plan: 
In the safety specification, the suggested important potential risk of ‘Malignancy (non-urinary 
tract) should be removed. Instead, in the section ‘missing information’ of the safety 
specification, it should be added that there is missing information regarding the long term risk 
of melanoma. 
The CHMP justified these changes as follows: 
The term ‘malignancy, non-urinary tract’ was based on the finding of 6 melanoma cases in the 
clinical trials and there was an imbalance in frequency between the exposure groups. One of 
the melanoma cases was pre-existing.  
There is no known plausible mechanism of action as to why empagliflozin might increase the 
risk of melanoma; therefore this was considered a weak signal.  
CHMP agreed with PRAC that it will be useful to monitor this outcome in the post-marketing 
phase, however, because of the weakness of the signal the risk needs to be downgraded to 
‘missing information’ and because the signal only applied to melanoma and (apart from 
urinary tract malignancies) no other malignancies, using the term ‘malignancies’ was 
considered to be too broad. Instead, the description needs to be more specific to clarify the 
risk being managed is that of melanoma and does not include other cancers such as breast 
cancer.  
The MAA has submitted an updated RMP, version 1.4 in which all outstanding issues from the 
PRAC Advice as well as the outcome of the CHMP discussion were incorporated. This RMP was 
considered acceptable. It contains the following Safety specification:

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Empagliflozin  is  an  orally administered,  selective  inhibitor  of  the  sodium-dependent  glucose  co-
transporter-2  (SGLT-2)  in  the  kidney.  It  is  intended  for  use  in  patients  with  type  2  diabetes 
mellitus.  
A  total  of  11250  randomised  and  treated  patients  are  included  in  the  evaluation  of  efficacy 
presented. Of these, 3021 patients were  randomised to empagliflozin 10 mg and 3994 patients 
were  randomised  to  empagliflozin  25  mg.  Another  3081  patients  were  randomised  to  receive 
placebo and 1154 patients were randomised to  an  active comparator. At Day 120 an additional 
(add-on  to  insulin)  study  was  submitted.  Study  1245.49  enrolled  563  subjects  of  whom  186 
received empagliflozin 10 mg and 189 empagliflozin 25 mg. The primary end point in most trials 
was a change in HbA1c. 
Monotherapy (study 1245.20): After 24 weeks, compared to placebo, empagliflozin monotherapy 
was associated with a clinically relevant reduction in HbA1c of -0.74% (10 mg) and -0.85% (25 
mg).  These  reductions  were  similar  compared  to  the  effect  of  sitagliptin  100  mg  (-0.73%).  A 
formal  monotherapy  study  comparing  empagliflozin  to  metformin  has  not  been  performed. 
However,  dose  finding  study  1245.9  included  empagliflozin  and  metformin,  showing  that  the 
effect of metformin on HbA1c was somewhat larger (-0.85%) compared to empagliflozin 25 mg 
(-0.72%).  
Add-on  to other oral  glucose-lowering  drugs  (study  1245.31  and  study  1245.19):  Compared  to 
placebo, empagliflozin as add on to metformin was associated with a clinically relevant reduction 
in  HbA1c  of  -0.57%  (10  mg)  and  -0.64%  (25  mg).  In  addition,  compared  to  placebo, 
empagliflozin  as  add  on  to  metformin  plus  SU  was  also  associated  with  a  clinically  relevant 
reduction in HbA1c of -0.64% (10 mg) and -0.59% (25 mg). Compared to placebo, empagliflozin 
as add on to pioglitazone (with and without metformin) was associated with a clinically relevant 
reduction in HbA1c of -0.48% (10 mg) and -0.61% (25 mg).  
Add-on to basal insulin (study 1245.33):  Compared to placebo  without changes in insulin  dose, 
empagliflozin as add on to insulin was associated with a clinically relevant reduction in HbA1c of -
0.56%  (10  mg)  and  -0.70%  (25  mg)  at  18  weeks.  After  these  18  weeks,  insulin  dose 
adjustments were allowed. The adjusted mean differences from placebo in insulin dose at Week 
78  were  -6.66  IU  in  the  empagliflozin  10  mg  group  and  -5.92  IU  in  the  empagliflozin  25  mg 
group.  Compared  to  placebo  after  78  weeks,  empagliflozin  as  add  on  to  insulin  was  associated 
with a clinically relevant reduction in HbA1c of  -0.46% (10 mg) and -0.62% (25 mg). It should 
be noted that these changes in insulin dose were small and of doubtful clinical relevance.  
Add-on  to  multiple  daily  injection  insulin  therapy  (Study  1245.49):  After  18  weeks,  change  in 
HbA1c  was  -0.44  for  10  mg  empagliflozin  and  -0.52  for  25  mg  empagliflozin,  compared  to 
placebo. After 52 weeks, the adjusted mean changes in insulin dose from baseline compared with 
placebo were -8.83 IU/day for empagliflozin 10 mg and  -11.22 IU/day for empagliflozin 25 mg. 
The placebo-adjusted mean changes in HbA1c values at 52 weeks were -0.38% for 10 mg and -
0.46% for 25 mg.

Patients with hypertension (study 1245.48): In this study, various antidiabetic drugs were used 
as  background  medication.  Compared  to  placebo,  there  was  a  relevant  decrease  in  HbA1c  (-
0.62% and -0.65% for empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg, respectively).  
Effects  on  body  weight:  In  the  pivotal  trials,  empagliflozin  was  associated  with  a  decrease  in 
body weight. For the pooled data of the pivotal trials, the treatment difference to placebo at 24 
weeks  was  1.8  kg  for  the  empagliflozin  10  mg  group  and  2.0  kg  for  the  empagliflozin  25  mg 
group. In the active controlled trial with glimepiride, treatment with  glimepiride led to  a 1.6 kg 
increase in mean body weight after 52 weeks, whereas mean body weight decreased by 3.2 kg in 
the  empagliflozin  25  mg  group.  The  resulting  adjusted  mean  difference  between  treatment 
groups  was  4.8  kg.  Body  weight  was  an  exploratory  endpoint  in  the  other  trials.  In  each  trial, 
empagliflozin provided reductions in body  weight  compared with placebo. The results were in a 
similar range as for the pivotal trials. 
Effects  on  blood  pressure:  In  the  pivotal  studies,  in  comparison  to  placebo,  empagliflozin  was 
associated with a lower systolic (-2.1 to -4.9 mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure systolic (-0.5 
to -2.5 mmHg). In the active controlled trial with glimepiride, after 52 weeks, the adjusted mean 
difference  in  to  glimepiride  was  -5.8  mmHg  for  SBP  and  -2.8  mmHg  for  DBP.  In  the  study  in 
patients with hypertension (study 1245.48), blood pressure was also lower with empagliflozin. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
In  the  dose  findings  studies  study  (1245.9,  study  1245.10),  the  25  mg  dose  of  empagliflozin 
provided better efficacy than the 10 mg dose. In each of the pivotal phase III trials, except for 
1245.23  (met+SU),  the  reduction  in  HbA1c  from  baseline  at  24  weeks  was  greater  for 
empagliflozin 25  mg than for empagliflozin  10 mg. The  pooled data of the pivotal trials showed 
that the adjusted mean change from baseline in HbA1c after 24 weeks of treatment was -0.70% 
for empagliflozin 10 mg and 0.76% for empagliflozin 25 mg. It could be useful to start treatment 
with  this  lower  dose  and  then  increase  the  dose  if  necessary.  Therefore  it  was  questioned  why 
the Applicant abandoned the 10 mg dose. The Applicant decided to re-introduce the 10 mg dose 
as a starting dose.  In the submitted pharmacology studies,  only in one  study  (Trial 1245.79) a 
10  mg  formulation  is  administered  as  a  single  dose  to  healthy  volunteers  under  fasting 
conditions. In this study bioequivalence is proven.  
The  company  requests  an  indication  for  empagliflozin  monotherapy  in  patients  for  whom 
metformin  is  considered  inappropriate.  This  can  be  due  to  intolerance  (gastrointestinal 
complaints)  or  contraindications.  Patients  with  gastrointestinal  complaints  with  metformin  were 
not  specifically  investigated.  However,  it  is  not  likely  that  gastrointestinal  complaints  due  to 
metformin  influence  the  efficacy  of  empagliflozin.  The  most  important  contraindications  for 
metformin  include  renal  impairment  (GFR<60  ml/min)  and  heart  failure.  With  respect  to  heart 
failure, there is no experience in clinical studies with empagliflozin in NYHA class III-IV. Patients 
with  renal  insufficiency  were  investigated  in  a  specific  trial  (study  1245.36).  Patients  with 
moderate renal impairment were subdivided in patients with GFR 45-60 and 30-45 ml/min. The 
adjusted mean treatment differences for empagliflozin 25 mg compared with placebo were -0.46 
and  -0.39%,  respectively.  In  the  pivotal  studies,  the  effect  of  empagliflozin  on  HbA1c  in 
individuals  with  GFR  45-60  ml/min  was  of  borderline  significance  (-0.33%  for  empagliflozin  25 
mg, n=50 and -0.48% for empagliflozin 10 mg, n=51). Thus, similar to other SGLT-2 inhibitors, 
treatment effects diminish with decreasing renal function.

Subgroup analyses of the pivotal trials demonstrate that the treatment effect of empagliflozin on 
HbA1C  in  patients  older  than  75  years  is  only  -0.21  and  -0.33%.  However,  in  the  subgroup  of 
elderly patients >75 years and renal function 45-60 ml/min efficacy in terms of HbA1C was not 
acceptable (-0.37%).  
The  effects  of  empagliflozin  were  compared  to  SU  in  a  non-inferiority  study.  The  decrease  in 
HbA1c was numerically greater with empagliflozin compared to glimepiride (-0.73% vs. -0.66%). 
Only  60% of  the patients in  the  glimepiride  group were  taking less than  the  maximum  allowed 
dose  of  4  mg,  whereas  all  patient  in  the  empagliflozin  group  were  treated  with  the  maximum 
dose of 25 mg. However, this is also observed in clinical practice. It may be difficult to uptitrate 
glimepiride due to higher risk of hypoglycaemia. Efficacy of empagliflozin was numerically larger 
than that of glimepiride  and statistical non-inferiority was established.  Therefore,  a formal non-
inferiority claim is acceptable. There were small increases in LDL cholesterol with empagliflozin, 
similar  as  what  has  been  seen  with  other  SGLT-2  inhibitors.  However,  HDL  levels  were  also 
somewhat increased. More data will be obtained when the data from the CV outcome study are 
obtained. These data should be provided in due time.  
In  several  studies,  mean  daily  glucose,  body  composition  and  meal  tolerance  tests  were 
performed  in  subgroups.  These  data  are  of  interest,  but  it  is  not  known  whether  or  not  the 
effects are of clinical relevance. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Trial  data  were  pooled  to  adequately  analyse  the  different  aspects  of  the  safety  profile  of 
empagliflozin. The  most relevant safety pooling  for the benefit-risk  assessment of empagliflozin 
is SAF-3 as this pooling corresponds to the pivotal trials with extensions (2957 patients in total). 
However, rare events and subgroups were assessed based on the largest available pooling, which 
included all 12873 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated in trials with empagliflozin (SAF-
5).  The  overall  exposure  to  empagliflozin  (10  or  25  mg)  was  1546  patient  years  (median 
treatment duration 369 days) in SAF-3 and 7828 patient years (median treatment duration 364 
days) in SAF-5.  
The  frequencies  of  premature  discontinuation  of  trial  medication  were  higher  in  the  placebo 
group  than  in  the  empagliflozin  groups  (SAF-3:  placebo:  17.1%;  empagliflozin  10  mg:  10.8%; 
empagliflozin 25 mg: 12.8%). The overall frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events was 
comparable  between  treatment  groups  (SAF-3:  placebo:  74.1%;  empagliflozin  10  mg:  71.8%; 
empagliflozin 25 mg: 70.1%). Investigator-assessed drug-related events were more frequent in 
the empagliflozin treatment groups than in the placebo group, whereas adverse events of severe 
intensity  were  more  frequent  in  the  placebo  group.  The  frequencies  of  patients  with  serious 
adverse  events  (including  fatal  events)  in  the  empagliflozin  groups  were  lower  than  in  the 
placebo group in the pivotal trials with extensions (SAF-3: placebo: 7.4%; empagliflozin 10 mg: 
7.1%; empagliflozin 25 mg: 5.8%). The most frequent events were nasopharyngitis (with similar 
frequencies  for  all  groups),  urinary  tract  infection  (with  similar  frequencies  for  all  groups), 
hyperglycaemia  (with  higher  frequencies  in  the  comparator  groups  than  in  the  empagliflozin 
groups),  and  hypoglycaemia  (with  higher  frequencies  in  the  empagliflozin  groups  than  in  the 
comparator groups.

As  could  be  expected,  there  was  more  hyperglycaemia  and  less  hypoglycaemia  with  placebo 
compared to empagliflozin. There was an increase in the number of hypoglycaemic episodes with 
empagliflozin in combination with MET+SU. In patients using other oral antihyperglycaemic drugs 
or  insulin  as  background  therapy,  empagliflozin  was  not  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of 
hypoglycaemia. 
There  were  no  relevant  changes  in  creatinine  levels.  Overall,  frequencies  of  decreased  renal 
function and volume depletion reported as adverse events were similar.  
There were no important effects of gender, BMI, race ethnicity and region on the adverse events 
with empagliflozin.  
Urinary tract infections and genital infections were classified as adverse events of special interest 
due to its mechanism of action. In accordance, these infections were identified as possible risks 
in the phase III protocols and respective patient information leaflets. However, infections did not 
have  to  be  specifically  monitored  or  followed  up  on  the  case  report  form.  Therefore,  the 
presented  results  may  be  unreliable.  A  wide  list  of  PTs  was  analysed.  Results  show  that  there 
was  an  increased  risk  of  genital  infections.  The  Applicant  has  included  genital  infections  as  an 
important  identified  risk  in  the  updated  RMP.  As  a  proactive  step  to  ensure  patient  safety,  the 
Applicant  proposes  a  PASS  to  evaluate  the  risk  of  genital  infection  in  empagliflozin-treated 
patients. On average, there was no increased risk of urinary tract infections. However, in patients 
with  a  history  of  urinary  tract  infections,  empagliflozin  was  associated  with  a  higher  risk  of 
urinary  tract  infections  (with  history:  'all  empa':  26.9%,  'all  comparators':  24.2%;  patients 
without  history:  'all  empa':  7.8%,  'all  comparators':  7.7%).  The  time  of  onset  of  UTI  in  the 
empagliflozin  groups  is  shorter  than  in  the  placebo  group  during  the  first  80  days,  most  likely 
due  to  symptomatic  UTIs.  The  Applicant  has  included  urinary  tract  infections  as  an  important 
identified risk in the RMP. As a proactive step to ensure patient safety, the Applicant proposes a 
PASS to evaluate the risk of urinary tract infection in empagliflozin-treated patients. 
As  empagliflozin  is  metabolised  by  Cytochrome  P450  enzymes  to  a  very  limited  extent  but 
instead  mainly  by  glucuronidation,  P450-mediated  pharmacokinetic  interactions  with  other 
medicinal products are not expected and known and intrinsic factors like age, gender and race do 
not  affect  the  pharmacokinetics  of  empagliflozin.  Thus  the  product  can  be  safely  used  from  a 
pharmacokinetic point of view. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Pharmacology  related  renal  stress  as  evident  from  the  data  provided  by  the  Applicant  is  not 
species  specific  and  could  be  relevant  for  humans  as  well.  It  is  therefore  important  that  renal 
function, especially where related to renal tubular integrity, is followed up in the RMP. 
In the mouse carcinogenicity study, renal tumours were observed. The mechanism behind these 
tumours was clarified and a satisfactory response to the List of Outstanding Issues was received. 
The  formation  of  the  cytotoxic  male  mouse  renal  metabolite  4-OH-CTA  is  a  key  event  in  the 
proposed  mechanism.  Yet  any  potential  formation  of  this  metabolite  in  humans  has  not  been 
excluded.  There  was  no  clear  pattern  with  respect  to  the  occurrence  of  malignancies.  With 
empagliflozin, there were more cases of bladder cancer compared to comparators (empagliflozin 
2  cases,  comparators  0  cases),  but  fewer  cases  of  breast  cancer  (empagliflozin  1  case, 
comparators 2 cases). It is likely that these differences do not represent a causal association, but 
Assessment report

are due to numerical imbalances. Nevertheless, long term effects of empagliflozin on the risk of 
malignancies cannot be excluded. The Applicant was requested to discuss all the observed cases 
for  malignant  melanoma,  renal  cancer  and  bladder  cancer  in  more  detail.  The  urinary  tract 
carcinogenic risk cannot be ruled out and should be further monitored and studied in view of the 
finding  in  male  mice  in  the  preclinical  studies  and  conclusive  evidence  that  the  involved  4-OH 
CTA metabolite is absent in humans. This can be done with additional PhVig activities in the RMP. 
For malignant melanoma the imbalance in the number of cases remains a concern. However, in 
the absence of a mechanistic rationale and non-clinical findings for malignant melanoma, routine 
PhVig activities in the RMP is considered appropriate because there is currently a lack long term 
data. 
Variable  hepatic  effects  seen  in  animal  studies  were  discussed  to  clarify  the  clinical  relevance, 
especially  in  relation  with  the  hepatic  findings  in  patients.  It  was  concluded  that  the  hepatic 
findings  in  animals  do  not  reflect  the  profile  of  a  clear  hepatotoxic  compound.  However,  some 
signals  were  found  including  mild  elevations  of  AST  and  ALT,  incidental  proliferation  or 
hypertrophy  of  Kupffer  cells,  and  some  incidences  of  hepatocellular  necrosis.  In  addition 
vacuolation  of  hepatocytes  or  sinusoidal  cells  was  seen,  which  may  reflect  increased  lipid 
mobilisation.  In  patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  the  exposure  to  empagliflozin  is 
significant increased. As no further in depth toxicological investigations have been undertaken to 
determine the precise nature of the vacuolation or the cause of AST/ALT elevations and sporadic 
incidence  of  necrosis,  it  is  premature  to  conclude  that  there  would  be  no  risk  for  adverse  liver 
events  in  patients.  It  is  therefore  agreed  that  liver  safety  is  followed  up  in  long-term  clinical 
studies and included as an important potential risk in the RMP.  
Other non-clinical aspects for  which there is remaining uncertainty on the clinical relevance  are 
ophthalmoscopic findings and the background for Leydig tumors.  
The  number  of  patients  with  serious  hepatic  adverse  events  was  remarkably  higher  in  the 
empagliflozin  groups  compared  to  placebo  and  comparators.  In  all  but  one  of  these  cases  the 
independent committee of hepatic experts judged that the causal relationship with the treatment 
was not probable. Nevertheless, the number of cases with empagliflozin was remarkably high. On 
the other hand, there were no imbalances unfavourable for empagliflozin in less severe signs of 
liver  impairment.  The  frequency  of  patients  with  elevated  liver  enzymes  during  the  treatment 
period was not importantly influenced by history of liver or pancreatic disease at baseline or not. 
This means that the risk of liver injury cannot be diminished by limiting the use of empagliflozin 
to individuals without a history of liver or pancreatic disease. Regular follow-up of liver enzymes 
to  prevent  hepatic  injury  was  discussed  by  the  Applicant.  Empagliflozin  did  not  increase  the 
frequency  of  patients  with  elevated  ALT  and/or  AST  among  all  patients  and  among  several 
subgroups.  The  occurrence  of  high-level  elevations  was  low,  and  during  the  empagliflozin 
development program there were no reports of drug induced hepatotoxicity such as fatalities or 
liver transplantation. Therefore, regular follow-up of liver enzymes will add unnecessary burdens 
to clinicians and patients without added benefit. 
In  clinical  studies,  exposure  to  empagliflozin  increased  with  the  degree  of  renal  impairment. 
Patients with different  degrees of renal impairment  were analysed separately. The frequency of 
patients  with  any  adverse  events,  serious  adverse  events,  and  adverse  events  leading  to 
discontinuation  of  trial  medication  increased  with  the  degree  of  renal  impairment.  Importantly,

empagliflozin  treatment  was  associated  with  a  higher  frequency  of  decreased  renal  function, 
genital infection and urinary tract infection in patients with moderate renal impairment. 
In  the  subgroup  of  patients  using  diuretics,  frequency  for  volume  depletion  was  slightly  higher 
for  patients  using  empagliflozin  compared  to  comparators  (patients  with  diuretics  use  at 
baseline:  placebo:  2.2%,  empagliflozin  10  mg:  2.5%,  empagliflozin  25  mg:  2.7%;  'all 
comparators': 2.2%). The same was true for patients taking loop diuretics at baseline (patients 
with loop diuretics use at baseline: placebo: 2.9%, empagliflozin 10 mg: 4.9%, empagliflozin 25 
mg:  3.0%;  'all  comparators':  2.8%).  Therefore,  caution  should  be  exercised  in  patients  on 
diuretics. This should be mentioned in the SmPC. 
Different  age  groups  were  analysed  separately.  There  was  a  higher  frequency  of  urinary  tract 
infections,  volume  depletion  and  decreased  renal  function  in  patients  ≥75  years.  In  elderly 
patients, the frequency of urinary tract infection was higher in the empagliflozin groups especially 
for the age group 75 years and older (SAF-5: placebo: 25 patients, 10.5%; empagliflozin 10 mg: 
34 patients; 15.7%; empagliflozin 25 mg: 41 patients; 15.1%). However, the higher frequency 
of urinary tract infection in patients >75 years with empagliflozin may be explained by declining 
renal  function:  in  patients  >75  years  with  baseline  eGFR  ≥45  or  ≥60  mL/min/1.73  m2,  the 
frequency of urinary tract infections tended to be comparable between the empagliflozin and the 
placebo  groups,  whereas  in  the  matching lower  eGFR  categories,  frequencies were  increased  in 
the  empagliflozin  groups  compared  with  the  placebo  group.  These  data  suggest  that  renal 
function is a determinant of urinary tract infections in patients ≥75 years. The increased risk of 
volume  depletion  in  patients  ≥75  years  with  empagliflozin  is  an  important  issue  (placebo:  5 
patients,  2.1%;  empagliflozin  10  mg:  5  patients;  2.3%;  empagliflozin  25  mg:  12  patients; 
4.4%).  Subgroup  analyses  demonstrated  that  this  higher  frequency  was  independent  of  renal 
function  category.  The  frequency  of  decreased  renal  function  was  slightly  higher  in  the 
empagliflozin 25 mg group for the age  categories 75 years and older  (4  patients (1.7%) in  the 
placebo group vs. 6 patients (2.2%) for empagliflozin 25 mg). Taken together, caution should be 
exercised in elderly patients. This should be mentioned in the SmPC.  
Bone fractures were of special interest, but not identified as a possible risk. The reported rates of 
bone  fracture  were  very  low  and  similar  for  all  treatment  groups.  Changes  in  BMD  were  not 
found.  However,  treatment  duration  was  too  short  (1  year)  and  the  number  of  patients  very 
small (48 treated with empagliflozin). In addition, urine NTx to creatinine ratio increased slightly 
in  the  empagliflozin  groups,  whereas  it  decreased  slightly  in  the  comparator  groups.  Harmful 
effects of empagliflozin cannot be excluded. In the PRAC-rapport the necessity for a PASS will be 
discussed.  In  case  of  PASS,  it  is  advised  to  include  bone  fracture  incidence  in  the  PASS.  For 
comparison, also with Dapagliflozin BMD measurements were asked in a subset of patients in the 
CV outcome study in order to obtain more data on bone metabolism. 
In animals, renal calcifications were observed. There was not an increased risk of kidney stones 
with empagliflozin in the development programme.

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The  observed  effects  of  empagliflozin  on  HbA1c,  body  weight  and  blood  pressure  could  be 
beneficial for patients as they may translate into reductions in macrovascular and microvascular 
disease  in  the  long  term.  Long-term  effects  have  not  been  investigated.  The  results  of  the  CV 
outcome study are awaited.  
There were small increases in LDL cholesterol with empagliflozin. However, HDL levels were also 
somewhat increased.  
Although the 25 mg performed better, the lower dose also showed clinically significant changes 
in HbA1c. It could be useful to start treatment with this lower dose and then increase the dose if 
necessary,  also  because  serious  side  effects  appear  dose-dependent,  in  particular  in  high-risk 
patients, in particular the elderly. Therefore it was questioned why  the Applicant abandoned the 
10 mg dose. Subsequently, the Applicant decided to re-introduce  the 10  mg dose  as a starting 
dose.  This  10  mg  is  acceptable  from  a  clinical  point  of  view  and  supported  by  earlier  policy  of 
CHMP regarding another SGLT2 inhibitor.  
The  company  requested  an  indication  for  empagliflozin  monotherapy  in  patients  for  whom 
metformin  is  considered  inappropriate.  This  can  be  due  to  intolerance  (gastrointestinal 
complaints)  or  contraindications.  The  most  important  contraindications  for  metformin  include 
renal  impairment  (GFR<60  ml/min)  and  heart  failure.  Patients  with  gastrointestinal  complaints 
with  metformin  were  not  specifically  investigated.  However,  it  is  not  likely  that  gastrointestinal 
complaints  due  to  metformin  influence  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  empagliflozin.  This  indication 
has  also  been  accepted  for  dapagliflozin.  Patients  with  heart  failure  NYHA  III  and  IV  were  not 
investigated  in  any  of  the  trials.  In  patients  with  GFR  45-60  ml/min,  efficacy  was  of  borderline 
significance and the risk of adverse events tended to be higher. Therefore, empagliflozin cannot 
be  recommended  in  these  patients.  In  general,  the  benefit-risk  ratio  for  empagliflozin  was 
negative for patients with a GFR below 60 ml/min.  However, several commonly used classes of 
antihyperglycemic  agents  are  contraindicated  in  patients  with  a  GFR  below  60  ml/min,  and  a 
subgroup  of  patients  may  benefit  from  treatment  with  empagliflozin.  Therefore,  as  an 
alternative,  initiation  of  treatment  with  empagliflozin  may  only  be  allowed  in  patients  with  an 
eGFR of ≥60 mL/min/1.73m2 but continuation of empagliflozin therapy may be allowed until the 
eGFR decreases to <45 mL/min, at which time empagliflozin therapy would be discontinued.  
In  general,  the  safety  profile  of  empagliflozin  is  that  of  a  SGLT  2  inhibitor.  Overall,  no  major 
differences  were observed  between the 10  and  25  mg dose, but number of  AEs may be higher 
for the higher dose in some high risk patients, like patients ≥75 years. There was an increased 
risk  of  genital  infections  in  patients  using  empagliflozin.  Genital  infections  were  usually  not 
serious,  but  can  be  very  uncomfortable.  The  Applicant  has  included  genital  infections  as  an 
important  identified  risk  in  the  updated  RMP.  As  a  proactive  step  to  ensure  patient  safety,  the 
Applicant  proposes  a  PASS  to  evaluate  the  risk  of  genital  infection  in  empagliflozin-treated 
patients.  The  higher  risk  of  urinary  tract  infections  in  patients  with  a  history  of  urinary  tract 
infections  is  very  important,  as  urinary  tract  infections  may  be  very  serious.  The  Applicant  has 
included  urinary  infections  as  an  important  identified  risk  in  the  RMP.  As  a  proactive  step  to 
ensure  patient  safety,  the  Applicant  proposes  a  PASS  to  evaluate  the  risk  of  urinary  tract 
infection  in  empagliflozin-treated  patients.  There  were  no  relevant  changes  in  creatinine  levels.

Overall,  frequencies  of  decreased  renal  function  and  volume  depletion  reported  as  adverse 
events  were  similar.  However,  due  to  the  higher  risk  of  volume  depletion,  caution  should  be 
exercised in patients on diuretics.  
In elderly patients (>75 yrs) with renal function > 60 ml/min, efficacy was acceptable. However, 
there  was  an  increased  risk  of  urinary  tract  infections,  volume  depletion  and  decreased  renal 
function. Thus, care should be taken. 
With empagliflozin there was a low risk of hypoglycaemia, except in patients using empagliflozin 
in combination with MET+SU. In these patients empagliflozin should be used with caution. 
The  increased  risk  of  serious  hepatic  adverse  events  is  important;  therefore,  the  inclusion  of 
hepatic injury as an important potential risk in the updated RMP is warranted.  
There  was  an  imbalance  in  malignancies,  and  long  term  effects  of  empagliflozin  on  the  risk  of 
malignancies  cannot  be  excluded.  The  urinary  tract  carcinogenic  risk  cannot  be  ruled  out  and 
should  be  further  monitored  and  studied  in  view  of  the  finding  in  male  mice  in  the  preclinical 
studies and conclusive evidence that the involved 4-OH CTA metabolite is absent in humans. This 
can be done with additional PhVig activities in the RMP. 
In  the  absence  of  a  mechanistic  rationale  and  non-clinical  findings  for  malignant  melanoma, 
routine PhVig activities for an important potential risk in the RMP are considered appropriate. 
Harmful effects of empagliflozin on bone cannot be excluded. This issue should be addressed in 
the RMP as a potential risk.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Although it has clearly been shown that empagliflozin has the B/R profile of a SGLT-2 inhibitor, 
several issues remain. These issues concern the use in patients with a GFR<60 ml/min and the 
risk of serious liver injury. The issue with renal function may be solved by restricting the  use of 
empagliflozin to patients with an eGFR of ≥60 mL/min/1.73m2 but continuation  of empagliflozin 
therapy  may  be  allowed  until  the  eGFR  decreases  to  <45  mL/min,  at  which  time  empagliflozin 
therapy would be discontinued. This has been reflected in sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC. 
The  increased  risk  of  serious  hepatic  adverse  events  is  important;  therefore  the  inclusion  of 
hepatic injury as an important potential risk in the updated RMP is warranted. 
In general, the benefit-risk balance of empagliflozin in type 2 diabetes mellitus is acceptable but 
its use in patients with moderate renal failure cannot be recommended. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by 
consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Jardiance in the treatment of

type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic control in adults as: 
Monotherapy 
When diet and exercise alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control in patients for whom 
use of metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance. 
Add-on combination therapy 
In combination with other glucose–lowering medicinal products including insulin, when these, 
together with diet and exercise, do not provide adequate glycaemic control (see sections 4.4, 
4.5 and 5.1 for available data on different combinations).

The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in 
the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed 
subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk 
profile or as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) 
milestone being reached.  
If the dates for submission of a PSUR and the update of a RMP coincide, they can be submitted 
at the same time.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Type II variation 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharma 
EEIG submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 7 November 2017 an application for a variation 
following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
1234/2008.  
The following variation was requested:

Extension of indication to include the combination treatment with nivolumab and ipilimumab of adult 
patients with intermediate/poor-risk advanced renal cell carcinoma. As a consequence sections 4.1, 
4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the Opdivo and Yervoy SmPCs were proposed to be updated. The Package 
Leaflet and the Risk Management Plan (version 19.0 for Yervoy and version 13.0 for Opdivo) were 
proposed to be updated in accordance. In addition, the Worksharing applicant (WSA) would take the 
opportunity to correct some typos throughout the Yervoy and Opdivo product information. 
The requested worksharing procedure proposed amendments to the Summary of Product 
Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included EMA Decisions 
P/0003/2017 for Yervoy and P/0064/2014 and P/0004/2017 for Opdivo on the agreement of a 
paediatric investigation plan (PIP) and CW/1/2011 on the granting of a class waiver.  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0003/2017 for Yervoy was completed and the 
PIP P/0064/2014 and P/0004/2017 for Opdivo was not yet completed as some measures were 
deferred.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the application included a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products. However no similarity assessment was conducted as the market exclusivity 
for Torisel (temsirolimus) expired on 19/11/2017 before the start of this worksharing procedure.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This application concerns an extension of indication to include the first-line combination treatment with 
nivolumab and ipilimumab of adult patients with intermediate/poor-risk advanced renal cell carcinoma.

OPDIVO (nivolumab) 
Nivolumab, a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody (HuMAb), binds to the 
programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor and blocks the interaction with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-
L1) and programmed death-ligand 2 (PD-L2). The PD-1 receptor is a negative regulator of T-cell 
activity that has been shown to be involved in the control of T-cell immune responses. Interaction 
between the PD-1 receptor and PD-L1/ PD-L2 results in inhibition of T-cell proliferation and cytokine 
secretion. Nivolumab blocks the binding of the PD-1 receptor to PD-L1/PD-L2 and potentiates T-cell 
responses, including anti-tumour responses. In syngeneic mouse models, blocking PD-1 activity 
resulted in decreased tumour growth. Nivolumab is currently approved as OPDIVO® in the United 
States (US), European Union (EU), Japan, and several other countries. Initial and subsequent 
approvals have resulted in indications for advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 
renal cell carcinoma (RCC), squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), urothelial 
carcinoma, classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma (cHL), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (US only).  
YERVOY (ipilimumab) 
Ipilimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody (IgG1κ), is a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 CTLA-4 
immune checkpoint inhibitor. CTLA-4 is a regulator of T-cell activity. Ipilimumab blocks T-cell inhibitory 
signals induced by the CTLA-4 pathway, increasing the number of reactive T-effector cells which 
mobilize to mount a direct T-cell immune attack against tumour cells. CTLA-4 blockade can also reduce 
T-regulatory cell function, which may contribute to an anti-tumour immune response. Ipilimumab may 
selectively deplete T-regulatory cells at the tumour site, leading to an increase in the intratumoural T-
effector/ T-regulatory cell ratio which drives tumour cell death. YERVOY® is indicated for the treatment 
of unresectable or metastatic melanoma and, in the US only, for adjuvant treatment after complete 
resection of high-risk stage III melanoma. 
Combination therapy with nivolumab + ipilimumab 
Combined nivolumab (anti-PD-1) and ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) mediated inhibition results in improved 
anti-tumour responses in melanoma. In murine syngeneic tumour models, dual blockade of PD-1 and 
CTLA-4 resulted in synergistic anti-tumour activity. The combination of nivolumab + ipilimumab is 
approved for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma. 
Renal cell carcinoma 
Renal cell carcinoma overall accounts for 2% of all adult malignancies. Worldwide, about 270,000 new 
cases are diagnosed and about 116,000 patients die each year. Metastatic disease is found in ~ 30% 
of subjects at diagnosis, and close to 90-95% is of clear-cell histology. A couple of risk models have 
been developed to predict the prognosis of patients with mRRC, for example the Memorial Sloan 
Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database 
Consortium (IMDC) (Noe, A. et al. World J Uro. 2016;34:1067-72). The IMDC developed a prognostic 
model that classifies advanced RCC based on six risk factors: Karnofsky Performance Status 
(KPS)<80%, <1 year from diagnosis to treatment, haemoglobin concentration <lower limit of normal, 
Calcium concentration > upper limit of normal, neutrophil count >upper limit of normal, platelet count 
> upper limit of normal (Heng et al.Lancet Oncology. 2013;14:141-48). Based on prognostic factors, 
three risk groups are identified: favourable risk (0 factors), intermediate risk (1-2 factors) or poor-risk 
(3-6 factors). 
The median OS is estimated to be around 7.8 months in the poor-risk group, 22.5 months in the 
intermediate risk group and 43.2 months in the favourable risk group.

Standard treatments for previously untreated advanced RCC  
Cytokine therapy, such as IL-2 and IFN, can achieve objective responses in 5% to 20% of patients, 
including durable complete responses in some patients, but these treatments are associated with 
significant toxicity. Currently, available targeted therapies for previously untreated advanced RCC can 
be divided into two classes, namely anti-angiogenic agents and mTOR inhibitors. The anti-angiogenic 
agents are sorafenib, sunitinib, pazopanib, axitinib, tivozanib (VEGF-binding tyrosine kinase inhibitors), 
and bevacizumab (VEGF-binding monoclonal antibody). Everolimus and temsirolimus target the mTOR 
pathway.  
Table 1 provides a summary of available agents in the US and EU for previously untreated RCC and 
Table 2 shows the results of clinical trials of approved agents for the treatment of first-line advanced 
RCC.  
Table 1 Preferred Agents Approved in US and EU for the Treatment of Previously Untreated 
Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma 
According to the 2016 ESMO guideline, sunitinib, bevacizumab plus interferon alpha, and pazopanib 
are all standard treatment options for favourable-risk and intermediate-risk patients, but sunitinib is an 
alternative to temsirolimus for the treatment of poor-risk patients in first-line RCC. According to NCCN 
guidelines, sunitinib, temsirolimus (poor-risk only), bevacizumab plus interferon alpha, and pazopanib 
are category 1 recommendations for first-line therapy of RCC.

Table 2 Results of Clinical Trials of Approved Agents for the Treatment of First-line 
Advanced RCC 
Nivolumab in advanced second line renal cell carcinoma 
Study CA209025 was the registrational Phase 3 study conducted in advanced RCC subjects previously 
treated with anti-angiogenic therapy. Nivolumab monotherapy demonstrated statistically significant 
and superior OS compared with everolimus (HR: 0.73 [98.52% CI: 0.57, 0.93]; stratified log-rank test 
p-value = 0.0018). Median OS was 25.00 months (95% CI: 21.75, NA) in the nivolumab group and 
19.55 months (95% CI: 17.64, 23.06) in the everolimus group.  
Ipilimumab in RCC 
Study MDX010-11 was a Phase 2 study of ipilimumab monotherapy in metastatic RCC. A total of 61 
subjects received a single dose of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg followed by either 1 mg/kg (21 subjects; 3-to-1 
mg/kg group) or 3 mg/kg (40 subjects; 3-to-3 mg/kg group) Q3W. All subjects were treated IV Q3W 
with 1 of 2 dosing regimens in sequential cohorts: in Cohort A, IL-2 experienced subjects received a 
loading dose of 3 mg/kg ipilimumab with all subsequent doses of ipilimumab given at 1 mg/kg; and in 
Cohort B, subjects received all doses of ipilimumab at 3 mg/kg only.  
Among the 21 subjects in Cohort A, 1 (5%) subject experienced PR (partial response) to ipilimumab 
treatment with response duration lasting 18 months. 5 of 40 (12.5%) subjects in Cohort B achieved a 
PR with response durations of 7, 8, 12, 17, and 21 months; of these, 3 (25%) were treatment-naive 
and experienced the longest response durations (12, 17, and 21 months). In Cohort B, 25 subjects 
(63%) had Grade 3/4 AEs, including 6 subjects (15%) with Grade 4 AEs. Seventeen subjects (43%) 
had AEs that led to treatment discontinuation. Four subjects in Cohort B reported Grade ≥ 3 colitis 
leading to bowel perforation or colectomy, ultimately resulting in death in 2 subjects. Based on these 
safety results, development of ipilimumab monotherapy for the treatment of advanced RCC was 
stopped.

Nivolumab + ipilimumab in RCC 
Treatment with a combination of nivolumab + ipilimumab, recognising the potential for incremental 
toxicity associated with the addition of ipilimumab, was considered by the applicant for several 
reasons. The non-redundant and complementary pathways of PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors suggest the 
potential for synergy when used in combination. This is consistent with preclinical data from in vitro 
studies and syngeneic mouse models which indicate that the combination of PD-1 and CTLA-4 receptor 
blockade may have synergistic anti-tumour activity. In advanced melanoma, nivolumab in combination 
with ipilimumab resulted in an improved PFS and OS compared to ipilimumab monotherapy, and a 
numerically but not statistically significantly longer OS when compared to nivolumab monotherapy (HR 
0.85, 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.07) (Wolchok, J.D. et al. N Engl J Med. 2017;377:1345-56).

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
For this application, the clinical pharmacology program of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab 
was based on data from two studies: one phase 1 study CA209016 in prior treated and treatment-
naïve subjects with metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (mRCC) to evaluate nivolumab in combination 
with ipilimumab, and a phase 3, randomised, open-label study of nivolumab combined with ipilimumab 
versus sunitinib in subjects with previously untreated advanced or mRCC (study CA209214).   
Population PK (popPK) of the nivolumab+ipilimumab combination was performed by combining data 
from these studies with data from selected nivolumab and ipilimumab studies, which supported 
previous monotherapy and combination therapy submissions of nivolumab and ipilimumab. The 
nivolumab and ipilimumab exposures determined by popPK analyses were used to characterise the E-R 
relationships of efficacy and safety. The immunogenicity of nivolumab and ipilimumab was also 
assessed in each of the above studies.  
Pharmacokinetic characteristics of nivolumab and ipilimumab as previously described by a time-
independent clearance (CL) model for their respective melanoma monotherapy MAAs is summarised in 
Table 3. Pharmacokinetics of nivolumab was similar in subjects with melanoma as with mRCC.

Combination therapy in RCC, nivolumab and ipilimumab pharmacokinetics  
Analytical methods 
Bioanalytical methods used for quantifying nivolumab serum concentrations in the development 
program were cross-validated and evaluated for interference with ipilimumab, hence allowed merging 
of the exposure data for popPK analysis. 
Nivolumab PopPK analyses 
For the current analyses, the nivolumab popPK analysis dataset included 32843 nivolumab 
concentration values from 6468 subjects with melanoma, NSCLC, SCLC, CRC, HCC or mRCC who 
received nivolumab monotherapy or combination therapy (with ipilimumab or chemotherapy). The 
covariates assessed included administration with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg (Q3W) or 1 mg/kg (Q3W, Q6W, 
or Q12W), sex, race, baseline body weight (BBWT), baseline eGFR, baseline PS, and tumour type on 
nivolumab clearance; and sex and BBWT on Volume of distribution. The predictive performance of the 
full popPK model was determined using prediction corrected visual predictive check (pcVPC) with 
stratification by the selected nivolumab dosing regimen in different solid tumours. The popPK model 
was adequately re-evaluated.

Nivolumab pharmacokinetics was described by a linear 2-compartment model with time-varying 
clearance, such that nivolumab clearance decreases by ~33% at steady-state compared to initial 
clearance. Compared to nivolumab therapy, the clearance of nivolumab administered with ipilimumab 
increased somewhat: 1 mg/kg Q3W (the proposed regimen for metastatic mRCC subjects) or Q12W 
was not different than that of nivolumab monotherapy, whereas administration with ipilimumab 1 
mg/kg Q6W resulted in a 17% increase in nivolumab clearance, and ipilimumab 3 mg/kg Q3W resulted 
in a 29% increase in nivolumab clearance (compared to monotherapy). Nivolumab clearance was 
higher in subjects with higher baseline body weight and eGFR, and lower in female subjects, but the 
magnitude of the differences was not considered to be clinically relevant. Sensitivity analyses found 
that nivolumab clearance was higher in subjects with higher baseline LDH (up to 44%) and with lower 
baseline albumin (< 20%), and higher (~20%) in the presence of nivolumab anti-drug antibody (ADA). 
Nivolumab volume of distribution was higher in subjects with higher baseline body weight. Sex, 
ethnicity, PS, and eGFR did not have clinically relevant effect on nivolumab clearance; sex did not have 
a clinically relevant effect on nivolumab volume of distribution. 
Graphical representations of the effect of categorical and continuous covariates on the typical value of 
the structural model parameters of clearance and volume of distribution are presented in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Covariate Effects on Nivolumab PK Model Parameters (Full Nivolumab popPK 
Model) 
The individual parameter estimates for nivolumab 3 mg/kg in combination with 1 mg/kg ipilimumab 
obtained from the full popPK model and the exposure estimates are summarized in  
Table 4 and Table 5. Keeping in mind the time-dependent and time-independent clearance models, 
clearance, volume of distribution at steady-state and terminal elimination half-life are similar to those 
determined previously for nivolumab monotherapy (compare with Table 3). The steady-state exposure 
estimates for nivolmab in subject with RCC in combination with ipilimumab were slightly higher than 
estimated for nivolumab monotherapy (compare with Table 3), but the variability in the estimations is 
very high for the combination (52-244%, Table 5). This was caused by a single outlier, for which the

single outlier (Table 5 lower part), the intersubject variability was in line with previous data.

Figure 2 demonstrates the change in nivolumab clearance over time. The maximal model predicted 
decrease in clearance is ~21% in subjects with PS of 0, and ~31% in subjects with PS > 0. The time 
for half maximal reduction is ~92 days (2200 hours). The variability around Emax predicted by the 
model is ~29%. The maximal change in clearance (Emax) was similar across dose regimens and 
tumour types. 
Figure 2 Model-Estimated Change in Nivolumab Clearance versus Time from the 
Final Model  
Relation between nivolumab clearance and best overall response is shown in Figure 3. Mean baseline 
clearance of nivolumab was lowest in subjects with complete remission (CR), however, there is a full 
overlap in clearance between subjects with complete remission and other responses. Nivolumab 
clearance decreased more in subjects with a complete or partial remission (PR) than subjects with 
Stable Disease, and clearance decreased less in subjects with progressive disease (PD) than subjects 
with stable disease (SD).

Ipilimumab popPK analyses 
The current ipilimumab integrated popPK analysis used data from 3411 subjects from 16 studies 
conducted in subjects with solid tumours, specifically, melanoma, NSCLC, SCLC, CRC, HCC, and mRCC 
who received ipilimumab either as monotherapy or in combination with nivolumab. The covariates 
assessed included administration with nivolumab (various regimens), baseline body weight, baseline 
LDH, line of therapy, and tumour type on ipilimumab clearance, and baseline body weight on 
ipilimumab volume of distribution.  
The pharmacokinetics of ipilimumab was described by a linear 2-compartment model with time-varying 
clearance, such that ipilimumab clearance decreases by ~22% over time when administered with 
nivolumab. Nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W, 1 mg/kg Q2W, and 1 mg/kg Q3W had a statistically significant 
effect on ipilimumab clearance increasing by ~18% (95% CI 8%-28%), 14% (95% CI 1%-28%), and 
9% (95% CI 5%-13%); however, the magnitude of these effects were < 20% and as such not 
considered clinically relevant. Nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q3W (the proposed regimen for mRCC) did not have 
a significant effect on ipilimumab clearance. The magnitude of the effect of baseline body weight on 
clearance and volume of distribution was outside the ± 20% boundaries, which is consistent with 
results from the previous analysis describing ipilimumab monotherapy pharmacokinetics, and thus 
baseline body weight was found to be a statistically significant covariate. The magnitude of the effect 
of baseline LDH was statistically significant (95% CI of estimated effect does not include 0); however, 
the magnitude of the effect was <20%, which is unlikely to be clinically relevant. Additionally, 
ipilimumab clearance was significantly lower (-9.3%; 95 CI -13.2% to -5.3%) in subjects who received 
first-line treatment compared to second-line treatment. There was no statistically significant difference 
in ipilimumab clearance in mRCC subjects compared to that in melanoma subjects. Sensitivity analyses 
found that ipilimumab clearance was higher in subjects with larger baseline tumour size and with lower 
baseline ALB, however, the magnitude of these differences was not considered to be clinically relevant. 
Ipilimumab clearance was not significantly different in the presence of anti-ipilimumab ADA.  
Graphical representations of the effect of categorical and continuous covariates on the typical value of 
the structural model parameters of clearance and volume of distribution are presented in Figure 4.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Binding of the PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, to the PD-1 receptor found on T cells inhibits T-cell 
proliferation and cytokine production. Upregulation of PD-1 ligands occurs in some tumours and 
signalling through this pathway can contribute to inhibition of active T-cell immune surveillance of 
tumours. Nivolumab is a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-
1 receptor and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2, releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated 
inhibition of the immune response, including the anti-tumour immune response. In syngeneic mouse 
tumour models, blocking PD-1 activity resulted in decreased tumour growth. 
CTLA-4 is a negative regulator of T-cell activity. Ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to 
CTLA-4 and blocks the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands, CD80/CD86. Blockade of CTLA-4 has 
been shown to augment T-cell activation and proliferation.  
PD-L1 has high affinity for PD-1 but can also bind to CD80 on T-cells and CD80 expression might 
contribute to PD-L1-induced inactivation of CD8+ T-cells (Rollins 2017).  Combination of nivolumab 
(anti-PD-1) and ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) may thus result in enhanced T-cell function that is greater 
than the effects of either antibody alone. In murine syngeneic tumour models, dual blockade of PD-1 
and CTLA-4 resulted in synergistic anti-tumour activity supporting the rationale for the combination of 
both products.

Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Dose selection 
The dose of nivolumab 3 mg/kg and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg for treatment of first line RCC was based on 
results from study CA209016, which included both prior treated and treatment-naïve subjects with 
mRCC. The study is described in detail in the dose response section 4.4.1. The decision was based on 
anti-tumour activity and safety data. Response rate in 1 mg/kg nivolumab + 3 mg/kg ipilimumab 
(cohort I-3) and 3 mg/kg nivolumab + 1 mg/kg ipilimumab (cohort I-1) was comparable 40.4% (see 
Table 8 and Table 9), but the safety profile of 3 mg/kg nivolumab + 1 mg/kg ipilimumab appeared to 
be more favourable: less subjects discontinued the study due to AEs and a lower incidence of Grade 3-
4 drug-related AEs in the 3 mg/kg nivolumab + 1 mg/kg ipilimumab (see Table 8 and Table 10 in dose 
response section 4.4.1). Treatment with 3 mg/kg nivolumab and 3 mg/kg ipilimumab in Cohort IN-3 
resulted in 3 of 6 subjects experiencing dose-limiting toxicities that exceeded the MTD.

2.3.1.  Exposure-effect analyses 
The exposure-response analyses performed by the applicant included data from studies with advanced 
or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Phase I CA209016 study included both previously treated 
and previously untreated subjects with mRCC, and a Phase III CA209214 study included previously 
untreated advanced/metastatic RCC subjects. Subjects in these two studies were treated with 
nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab. In addition to study CA209214 and CA209016, other phase 
I/III studies, nivolumab monotherapy evaluated in metastatic RCC (CA209003, CA209009, CA209010, 
and CA209025), were also included as these dataset included information on nivolumab monotherapy 
at different dose levels (0.3–10 mg/kg). 
The relationship between nivolumab exposure and objective response (OR) was characterised using a 
logistic regression model that incorporated the effects of covariates that may modulate the exposure-
response relationship. The exposure-OR analysis characterised the probability of achieving an OR of 
investigator assessed complete or partial tumour response as defined by RECIST criteria, termed 
Pr(OR), as a function of nivolumab exposure and selected covariates that may modulate the exposure-
response. Ipilimumab concentrations were not available for all studies, and therefore, ipilimumab dose 
was used as categorical predictor in exposure-response efficacy analyses.  
Assessment report  
EMA/902855/2019  
Page 23/176 
 
 
 
 
 
A full model was developed to quantify covariate effects, and this model was also used to establish the 
functional form of a relationship between Pr(OR) and exposure of nivolumab (Cavg1) and ipilimumab 
dose (as a categorical variable). Baseline covariates tested for E-R relationships of efficacy included: 
body weight (WT), age, sex, nivolumab clearance, albumin, Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) index, 
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) score, PD-L1 status, tumour size, prior anti-
angiogenic therapy, and line of therapy. 
A total of 1234 subjects were included in the analyses dataset for exposure-OR analyses. 
Nivolumab Cavg1 was not a significant predictor of Pr(OR), given that the estimated odds ratio and 
95% CI included 1. Ipilimumab treatment was a significant predictor of Pr(OR) (Figure 6), suggesting 
that odds ratio was higher for subjects treated with nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg 
(odds ratio=2.94) or ipilimumab 3 mg/kg (odds ratio=2.5), when compared to nivolumab 
monotherapy. 
Covariates that had significant effect on the odds of OR in the model include: PD-L1, sex, baseline KPS, 
baseline albumin and baseline nivolumab clearance. Male subjects were associated with higher Pr(OR) 
compared to female subjects (odds ratio=1.46), subjects with higher PD-L1 expression were 
associated with higher Pr(OR) compared to subjects with no PD-L1 expression (odds ratio=1.83), 
subjects with higher base line KPS (≥ 90) were associated with higher Pr(OR) compared to subjects 
with lower baseline KPS (<90) (odds ratio=1.52), and subjects with lower nivolumab clearance were 
associated with higher Pr(OR) compared to subjects with higher nivolumab clearance. Age, MSKCC, 
baseline body-weight, and baseline tumour size were not significant predictors of OR.

Exposure-response Analysis: OS 
The relationship between nivolumab exposure and OS was described by a semi-parametric Cox 
Proportional-Hazards (CPH) model and included assessments of the modulatory effect of covariates on 
this exposure-response relationship. 
A full covariate model was developed to quantify covariate effects, and this model was also used to 
establish the functional form of a relationship between hazard of death and exposure of nivolumab 
(Cavg1) and ipilimumab dose (as a categorical variable). Baseline covariates tested for exposure-
response relationships of efficacy included: body weight, age, sex, nivolumab clearance, albumin, KPS 
index, MSKCC score, PD-L1 status, tumour size, prior anti-angiogenic therapy, and line of therapy. 
A total of 1242 subjects were included in exposure-OS analyses. 
Assessment report  
EMA/902855/2019  
Page 25/176 
 
 
 
 
 
The predictor variables with a significant effect on OS were sex, MSKCC score, baseline KPS, PD-L1 
status, baseline nivolumab clearance, body weight (95% CI of effect did not include 1)(Figure 7). The 
exposure-response analysis in the full model showed that there was not a significant relationship 
between nivolumab Cavg1 and OS hazard ratio (95% CI of effect included 1), after accounting for the 
effect of other potential predictors. Ipilimumab treatment was not a significant predictor of OS and the 
95% CI of effect for subjects who received ipilimumab 1 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg in combination with 
nivolumab included 1. The 95% CI of all the other predictor variables (line of therapy, prior anti-
angiogenic therapy, PD-L1, age and baseline tumour size) evaluated included unity, indicating a lack of 
evidence for the effect of these variables on OS. 
The potential confounding of the effects of clearance and Cavg1 were assessed by examining the 
correlation between these estimated effects. The correlation between the estimated effects was not 
high, indicating that the full model containing these effects is not over-parameterized and both of 
these effects can be estimated simultaneously in the same model.

risk of Gr. 2+ immune mediated AE was higher in subjects who received nivolumab + ipilimumab than 
in subjects who received nivolumab monotherapy, and the risk increased with increasing ipilimumab 
daily Cavg (see Figure 8). However, this did not increase the risk of discontinuation (Figure 9). The risk 
of Gr. 2+ immune mediated AE was higher in subjects who received 2+ lines of therapy relative to 
subjects who received one line of therapy.

Immunogenicity 
In study CA209214, the incidence of nivolumab ADA was 26.0% (107/411 subjects) when nivolumab 3 
mg/kg was administered with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg. Only 2 subjects were neutralising (NAb) ADA 
positive and 9 subjects (2.2%) were considered persistent positive. The incidence of ipilimumab ADA 
was 6.3% (26/415 subjects). No subject was neutralising ADA positive (to ipilimumab) or considered 
persistent positive.

Of the 107 subjects who were nivolumab ADA positive, 7 (6.5%) subjects had a best overall response 
(BOR) of CR and 39 (36.4%) had a BOR of PR, with an objective response rate of 42.9%. Similarly, of 
the 304 subjects who were nivolumab ADA negative, 31 (10.2%) had a BOR of CR and 82 (27.0%) had 
a BOR of PR, with an ORR of 37.2%. The 2 NAb positive subjects had BOR of PR and unable to 
determine (UTD).  
The sample size for the ipilimumab ADA positive group was small and there were no ipilimumab 
neutralizing ADA positive subjects in the group to make any meaningful assessment of the ipilimumab 
immunogenicity effect on efficacy. 
Out of all the subjects treated with ipilimumab + nivolumab combination therapy in Study CA209214 
and who were evaluable for ADA, 5/107 (4.7%) nivolumab ADA positive subjects experienced AEs in 
the hypersensitivity/infusion reaction category. In comparison, 14/304 (4.6%) nivolumab ADA 
negative subjects experienced AEs in the hypersensitivity/infusion reaction category. No ipilimumab 
ADA positive subjects experienced hypersensitivity/infusion reactions AEs, whereas 19 (4.9%) 
ipilimumab ADA negative subjects experienced AEs in the hypersensitivity/infusion reaction category. 
2.3.2.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
For this application an extension of indication to include the first-line combination treatment with 
nivolumab and ipilimumab of adult patients with intermediate/poor-risk advanced renal cell carcinoma, 
the clinical pharmacology program of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab was based on data 
from two studies: one phase 1 study CA209016 in previously treated or untreated advanced or mRCC 
evaluating the dose of nivolumab and ipilimumab when administered together, and a Phase 3, 
randomised, open-label study CA209214 of nivolumab 3 mg/kg combined with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg 
versus sunitinib in subjects with previously untreated advanced or mRCC. 
For the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab, a dose finding study was conducted to select the 
dose of the combination in patients with advanced RCC. Three nivolumab/ipilimumab combinations, i.e. 
1/3, 3/1 and 3/3 mg/kg, respectively, were included in this dose finding study. No nivolumab or 
ipilimumab monotherapy arms were included in this study, hence the contribution of both components 
to the efficacy and safety of the combination is not clear. Treatment with a combination of 3 mg/kg 
nivolumab and 3 mg/kg ipilimumab, the doses approved for monotherapy, resulted in dose-limiting 
toxicities that exceeded the MTD, although this was based on a low number of patients. More subjects 
discontinued treatment due to drug-related AEs in the 1 mg/kg nivolumab + 3 mg/kg ipilimumab 
cohort compared to the 3 mg/kg nivolumab + 1 mg/kg ipilimumab cohort, 27.7% vs. 10.6%, 
respectively (Table 8). Efficacy based on objective response rate seemed comparable in both cohorts 
(Table 8). Based on the difference in safety profile between 1 mg/kg nivolumab + 3 mg/kg ipilimumab 
and 3 mg/kg nivolumab + 1 mg/kg ipilimumab in study CA209016, 3 mg/kg nivolumab + 1 mg/kg 
ipilimumab was selected by the Applicant for treatment of untreated subjects with RCC in the phase 3 
study CA209214. However, it is noted that patient characteristics with regard to prognostic/predictive 
factors for response to the combination differed to a relevant extent between the cohorts of patients 
treated with 1 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg (also refer to discussion on clinical efficacy). Therefore it is difficult to 
draw conclusions regarding dose-response for the combination therapy in RCC based on the current 
data. 
Of note, in study CA209216, the safety profile of the combination 3 mg/kg nivolumab + ipilimumab 1 
mg/kg appeared to be more favourable than in phase 3 study CA209214, where 21.6% of the subjects 
discontinued treatment due to drug-related adverse events.

For the monotherapy MAA, dose and exposure response evaluations suggested that increasing doses of 
nivolumab above 1 mg/kg did not change the likelihood of response in RCC. For ipilimumab no data 
are available in RCC for 1 mg/kg and limited data for 3 mg/kg ipilimumab followed by either 3 mg/kg 
or 1 mg/kg (MDX010-11). Therefore, knowledge regarding dose-response of ipilimumab in RCC is very 
limited.  
Referring to dose response of ipilimumab monotherapy in melanoma, increasing doses of ipilimumab 
(0.3 mg/kg vs. 3 mg/kg vs. 10 mg/kg) increased the likelihood of clinical response in melanoma 
(Figure 10 below; ipilimumab 1 mg/kg mean Cminss is 8.5 µg/ml study CA209014, indicated by the 
arrow). For the combination nivolumab+ipilimumab no difference in response rate was observed for 1 
mg/kg ipilimumab and 3 mg/kg ipilimumab, suggesting that ipilimumab dose-response for the 
combination therapy might be different from monotherapy. Furthermore, PD-L1 has high affinity for 
PD-1 but can also bind to CD80 on T-cells and CD80 expression might contribute to PD-L1-induced 
inactivation of CD8+ T-cells (Rollins 2017).  In murine tumour models, dual blockade of PD-1 and 
CTLA-4 resulted in synergistic anti-tumour activity. While in melanoma, it was shown that ipilimumab 
contributed to efficacy of the combination therapy in subjects with no PD-L1 expression (PD-L1 <1%) 
but not in subjects with PD-L1 >1% expression compared to the monotherapy nivolumab. Hence, it is 
unfortunate that no nivolumab monotherapy arm was included in studies CA209016 and CA209014 to 
evaluate the contribution of ipilimumab to the efficacy in mRCC.

Exposure-effect relationships, comparing the efficacy parameters (ORR and OS) for nivolumab 
monotherapy with the combination nivolumab + ipilimumab, were provided by the applicant to support 
the combination therapy in mRCC. The exposure-effect models show no difference between first line 
vs. second line, which at first sight suggests that the positive effect of adding ipilimumab to nivolumab 
holds for both first and second line treatment. It should be noted, however, that there are few patients 
in the studies that have had nivolumab monotherapy in the first line and that there are no data for 
ipilimumab monotherapy as data from study MDX010-11 were not included in the model because of 
the different dosing regimen applying a 3 mg/kg loading dose of ipilimumab. Hence, prior anti-
angiogenic therapy and line of therapy highly overlapped with ipilimumab administration. Actually, 
both type of models (Cox proportional hazard model and logistic regression) assume (i.e. ‘force’) that 
the covariates have an additive effect. This would mean that the model effect of first vs. second line is 
estimated from patients in first line on combination therapy and patients in second line on 
monotherapy; and also that the effect of ipilimumab on top of nivolumab is estimated from second line 
patients. If true, the model assumes by definition that the effect of nivolumab monotherapy and 
ipilimumab monotherapy is in the first line the same as in second line. To empirically justify this, the 
interaction term for line and nivolumab and line and ipilimumab should be estimated, but this can only 
be done when such patients are available in reasonable numbers, which is not the case. It was 
confirmed by the additional analyses of the same data provided by applicant at D90 that the numbers 
were too low to estimate the interaction term reliably. Therefore, the finding of ‘no effect for first line 
vs. second line’ in the model would rather be an assumption than a conclusion. A further point is that 
the differences between included patients are adjusted for, and also for this additivity of effects is used 
in addition to the assumption of ‘no unmeasured confounders’. Overall, the exposure-effect 
relationships do not discern the contribution to efficacy of each component of the combination while 
this needs to be elucidated considering the safety risks associated with ipilimumab.  
The risk of Gr. 2+ immune mediated AE was higher in subjects who received nivolumab + ipilimumab 
than in subjects who received nivolumab monotherapy, and the risk increased with increasing 
ipilimumab daily Cavg (Figure 8). According to the applicant this did not increase the risk of 
discontinuation (Figure 9). Subjects with low nivolumab exposure had an increased risk of 
discontinuation. Subjects with poor health condition have in general low nivolumab exposure and the 
risk of discontinuation increased for the combination therapy.  
In conclusion, as no nivolumab monotherapy arm was included in studies CA209016 and CA209214, 
the contribution of ipilimumab to the efficacy of the combination is not known and needs further 
substantiation because ipilimumab increases the toxicity compared to monotherapy nivolumab (see 
also clinical efficacy & safety discussion). 
Due to the different dosing recommendations for the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab for 
melanoma and RCC and a different dose for ipilimumab compared to monotherapy, there might be a 
risk of medication errors. The combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab at recommended monotherapy 
doses was not well tolerated. 
The incidence of nivolumab ADA was 26.0% (107/411 subjects) when nivolumab 3 mg/kg was 
administered with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg. This is higher than the incidence of nivolumab ADA for 
nivolumab monotherapy (~12%), but lower than for the combination 1 mg/kg nivolumab + 3 mg/kg 
ipilimumab in treatment of melanoma 37.8%. Neutralising antibodies were observed in 0.5% of 
subjects treated with the combination. Nivolumab clearance increased by ~20% in the presence of 
nivolumab antibodies. However, the response in ADA positive subjects was consistent with the overall 
response observed in CA209214. The immunogenicity of ipilimumab when given in combination with 
nivolumab was low (approximately 6.6% antibody positive), and had no impact on ipilimumab 
pharmacokinetics. Incidence of hypersensitivity/infusion reactions appeared not to be increased in 
subjects positive for either nivolumab or ipilimumab antibodies.  
Assessment report  
EMA/902855/2019  
Page 31/176 
 
 
 
Based on assessment of the presence of ADA and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) vs BOR, subjects with 
nivolumab and ipilimumab ADA did not show a reduction in efficacy. According to the applicant, the 
above conclusion is also valid for the relation between the presence of ADA and NAbs vs PFS and OS.  
Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of nivolumab and ipilimumab are in agreement with previous analyses for the 
combination (advanced melanoma EMEA/H/C/003985/II/0003). However, the intersubject variability in 
pharmacokinetic parameters of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab in study CA209214 is very 
high 52-366% (Table 5), much higher than previously shown for nivolumab 3 mg/kg monotherapy in 
subjects with RCC (typically 30-40%). The maximal values reported e.g. for Cmax1 of 6230 µg/ml, are 
not realistic values for 3 mg/kg nivolumab treatment with an estimated Cmax1 of 60-90 µg/ml. The 
intersubject variability of ipilimumab pharmacokinetic parameters of 20-40% is in line with previous 
variability data. The high intersubject variability and unrealistic high estimated maximal PK values of 
nivolumab were due to a single outlier subject, which was recorded to have received 1 mg nivolumab 
rather than the nominal dose amount of 187 mg. When this subject was excluded, the intersubject 
variability in parameters was reduced to 20.5% to 37.1% of %CV, which is in line with previously 
reported variability data.  
Co-administration of ipilimumab 1 mg/kg resulted in a modest <20% increase in nivolumab clearance, 
relative to the nivolumab clearance when given as monotherapy. Ipilimumab pharmacokinetics was 
similar when administered in combination with 3 mg/kg nivolumab or as monotherapy. The clearance 
of ipilimumab in RCC subjects was not significantly different than that of melanoma subjects treated 
with monotherapy. Baseline nivolumab clearance was a predictor for overall response and overall 
survival in line with previous mono- and combination therapy exposure-response analyses.  
In an earlier analysis across multiple tumour types, nivolumab and ipilimumab pharmacokinetics were 
described by a time-dependent clearance model where nivolumab clearance decreased by a maximum 
of 33% and ipilimumab by ~5% monotherapy and by 22% in combination with nivolumab. In general, 
subjects with CR and PR were observed to have greater decrease in clearance compared to non-
responders with SD and PD. This observation is consistent with that found for ipilimumab. Nivolumab 
baseline clearance was higher in subjects with PS > 0 subjects than subjects with PS = 0 by ~19%; 
however, the decrease in clearance with time was greater in subjects with PS > 0 than subjects with 
PS = 0 (31% vs. 21%). The hypothetical reason for this observation is that higher clearance is 
associated with greater disease severity. Thus, in subjects when disease condition is improved over 
time in responders, a decrease in clearance was observed. The underlying mechanism is not exactly 
clear, but may be related to decreases in cachexia in subjects who respond to therapy. 
2.3.3.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The nivolumab and ipilimumab combination dose regimen (nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg 
every 3 weeks for 4 doses followed by nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks) was selected for treatment 
of previously untreated subjects with RCC in the phase 3 study CA209214. The relative contribution of 
low dose ipilimumab to the efficacy of the combination is not clear, while exposure-response data 
indicate that ipilimumab increases toxicity (see also clinical efficacy & safety discussion). Therefore, the 
contribution of ipilimumab to the efficacy of the combination lacks sufficient substantiation. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The pivotal trial for the nivolumab combined with ipilimumab clinical development programme in 
advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the phase 3 study, CA209214. The current application for 
Assessment report

advanced RCC is based primarily on data from nivolumab combined with ipilimumab in CA209214 and 
supporting data from CA209016. 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
The dose-response study CA209016 is described briefly below and in more detail in section 4.4.2 under 
the heading: ’supportive study’. Study CA209016 was a phase 1 open-label study of nivolumab plus 
sunitinib or pazopanib, or nivolumab plus ipilimumab in subjects with metastatic renal cell carcinoma 
(mRCC).  
Objectives 
Primary: 
•  To assess the overall safety and tolerability of nivolumab plus sunitinib or pazopanib or ipilimumab, 
in order to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 
nivolumab plus sunitinib or pazopanib or ipilimumab in subjects with metastatic renal cell carcinoma 
(mRCC). 
Secondary: 
•  To assess preliminary anti-tumour activity of nivolumab plus sunitinib or pazopanib or ipilimumab in 
subjects with mRCC. 
Exploratory:  
•  To evaluate pharmacodynamic and predictive biomarkers of nivolumab plus sunitinib or pazopanib 
or ipilimumab in subjects with mRCC. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of nivolumab in subjects 
with mRCC and to explore exposure-response with respect to safety, efficacy, and biomarkers. To 
assess the immunogenicity of nivolumab. To assess the overall survival (OS) in mRCC subjects 
receiving nivolumab in combination with sunitinib or pazopanib or ipilimumab.  
Methodology 
5 treatment arms were explored: 
•  Nivolumab 2mg/kg or 5 mg/kg plus sunitinib (Arm S) 
•  Nivolumab 2 mg/kg plus pazopanib (Arm P) 
•  nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg (Arm I-1) 
•  nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg (Arm I-3) 
•  nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg (Arm IN-3) 
Number of subjects 
A total of 194 subjects were enrolled; 153 were treated, 33 in arm S, 20 in arm P, 47 in arm I-1, 47 in 
arm I-3, and 6 in arm IN-3.

Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion 
The study population included adults (≥ 18 years) with advanced or metastatic measurable RCC as 
defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria, with Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≥ 80%, and histological 
confirmation of a clear-cell component (dose escalation or dose expansion of arms S and P, arms I-1 
and I-3 and IN-3), or non-clear-cell limited to papillary, chromophobe or unclassified histology (dose 
escalation of arms S and P only). Subjects with prior systemic therapy and no prior systemic therapy in 
the advanced/metastatic setting and favourable or intermediate-risk MSKCC prognostic score were 
eligible to enrol for the initial cohorts of arm I-1 and I-3. Subjects with no prior systemic therapy, but 
the following exceptions of minimal treatment with any MSKCC prognostic score were eligible to enrol 
in the I-1 and I-3 expansion arms, and the IN-3 arm: 
•  One prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy for localized or locally advanced RCC with recurrence 
occurred ≥ 6 months after the last dose of the adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy 
•  Only prior cytokine based treatment for metastatic RCC (e.g., IFN-α or IL-2) 
Baseline demographics and disease characteristics  
Among all treated subjects, the majority of subjects were under the age of 65, white and male. At 
baseline, the majority of subjects were diagnosed with clear-cell RCC with KPS of 90 or 100, had 
favourable or intermediate-risk MSKCC prognostic scores and PD-L1 level ≤ 5%. The lung, lymph node 
and liver were the most common site of disease reported outside of the kidney. 
Efficacy results 
Objective response rate 
Nivolumab plus ipilimumab 
The investigator-assessed confirmed ORR was 40.4% in arm I-1 (nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1 
mg/kg), 40.4% in arm I-3 (nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipilimumab 3 mg/kg) (Table 9). Five (10.6%) 
subjects in arm I-1 obtained a complete response. No confirmed ORR is observed in arm IN-3 
(nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab 3 mg/kg).

2.4.2.  Main study 
CA209214  
CA209214 is a phase 3, randomised, open-label study of nivolumab 3 mg/kg combined with 
ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses followed by nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks vs. 
sunitinib monotherapy using the approved dose and schedule (50 mg orally once daily for 4 weeks 
followed by 2 weeks off, every cycle) in adult (≥ 18 years) subjects with previously untreated 
advanced RCC (either not amenable to curative surgery or radiation, or American Joint Committee on 
Cancer [AJCC] Stage IV). A final clinical study report (CSR) was completed based on a database lock 
date of 07-Aug-2017. These data form the basis of this application, and include efficacy and safety 
data with a median follow-up of 25.2 months (minimum follow-up of 17.5 months). 
CA209214 consisted of 3 phases: screening, treatment, and follow-up (Figure 11). At the time of 
randomisation, subjects were stratified according to IMDC prognostic score into one of 3 risk groups: 
Assessment report

favourable risk, intermediate risk or poor risk. Subjects were also stratified by region. Subjects were 
assessed for response (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours [RECIST] v1.1) by computed 
tomography or magnetic resonance imaging beginning 12 weeks (± 1 week) from randomisation and 
continuing every 6 weeks (± 1 week) for the first 13 months and then every 12 weeks until 
progression or treatment discontinuation, whichever occurred later. Subjects were allowed to continue 
study therapy after initial investigator-assessed RECIST v1.1-defined progression if the subject had an 
investigator-assessed clinical benefit and was tolerating study drug(s). After discontinuation of study 
therapy and completion of 2 follow-up visits to assess safety and collect 
pharmacokinetic/immunogenicity samples, subjects were followed every 3 months for survival.

Study participants 
The study included adults (≥ 18 years of age) with advanced (either not amenable to curative surgery 
or radiation, or AJCC Stage IV) histologically confirmed RCC with a clear-cell component. Prior systemic 
therapy for RCC was not permitted except for one prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy provided such 
therapy did not include an agent that targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or VEGF 
receptors and recurrence occurred at least 6 months after the last dose of adjuvant or neoadjuvant 
therapy. Subjects were to have a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) of at least 70%. To be eligible 
for the intermediate/poor-risk cohort, at least 1 of the 6 following prognostic factors as per IMDC 
criteria had to be present: 1) KPS equal to 70%; 2) less than 1 year from diagnosis to randomisation; 
3) haemoglobin < lower limit of normal; 4) corrected calcium concentration > 10 mg/dL; 5) absolute 
neutrophil count > upper limit of normal (ULN); 6) platelet count > ULN. 
A total of 174 sites in 28 countries randomised subjects (Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, 
Canada, Chile, Colombia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, 
Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Poland, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Turkey, United 
Kingdom, and United States). Of the 1096 randomised subjects, 1082 were treated. The first patient 
first visit date was 16-Oct-2014 and the last patient randomisation date was 04-Mar-2016. The last 
patient last visit date (clinical cut-off date) was 26-Jun-2017. 
Key Inclusion Criteria were:

Treatments 
In subjects randomised to the nivolumab + ipilimumab group (arm A), nivolumab at 3 mg/kg was 
administered IV over approximately 60 minutes followed by ipilimumab at 1 mg/kg administered IV 
over approximately 30 minutes. Separate infusion bags and filters were used for each infusion and the 
second infusion (ipilimumab) was started at least 30 minutes after the completion of the nivolumab 
infusion. Infusions were administered every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. Thereafter, nivolumab 3 mg/kg was 
administered IV over approximately 60 minutes every other week until treatment discontinuation. 
In subjects randomised to the sunitinib group (arm B), sunitinib was administered using the approved 
dose and schedule of 50 mg p.o. once daily for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks off, continuously. No dose 
increases or reductions were allowed for nivolumab.  
Dose modifications were not permitted for nivolumab or ipilimumab but were permitted for sunitinib as 
per the approved product label. A maximum of 2 sunitinib dose reductions in 12.5 mg decrements was 
allowed. Dose escalations of sunitinib were permitted as per the approved product label when a 
concomitant CYP3A4 inducer was needed.

Sample size and schedule of analyses 
The sample size of the study accounts for the 3 co-primary efficacy endpoints: ORR and PFS as per 
IRRC and OS evaluated in intermediate and poor-risk subjects with previously untreated mRCC. The 
overall alpha for this study is 0.05, which was split with 0.001 to evaluate ORR, 0.009 to evaluate PFS 
and 0.04 to evaluate OS. 
ORR was analysed with an alpha of 0.001. PFS was evaluated for treatment effect at an alpha of 0.009 
(two-sided, penalized 0.001 from a 0.01 allocation), with at least 80% power; no interim analysis of 
PFS was planned. OS was evaluated for treatment effect at an alpha level of 0.04 (two-sided) with 
90% power, accounting for two formal interim analyses to assess efficacy (Table 13).

It was estimated that approximately 1070 previously untreated mRCC subjects would be randomised in 
a 1:1 ratio. Among them, 820 subjects (76.6%) with intermediate/poor-risk and approximately 250 
(23.4%) subjects with favourable risk as per IMDC (IMDC prognostic score = 0) were to be 
randomised. Assuming a 21% screen failure rate, it was estimated that approximately 1355 subjects 
would be enrolled in order to have 820 intermediate/poor-risk subjects randomised. The hypothesized 
median PFS in the control group was 9 months, based on weightedly averaging 11 months in the 
intermediate risk and 4 months in the poor risk (Motzer et al, NEJM 2007). The hypothesized median 
OS in the control group was based on a weighted average of 26 months for intermediate risk and 8 
months in the poor risk group (Motzer et al, NEJM, 2014). 
Table 13 Summary of Sample Size Parameters and Schedule of Analyses 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomised 1:1 and stratified by International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium 
(IMDC) prognostic score (0 vs. 1-2 vs. 3-6) and region (US vs. Canada/Western Europe/Northern 
Europe vs. Rest of World). 
Of the 1096 subjects randomised (550 to nivolumab + ipilimumab, 546 to sunitinib), 1082 (98.7%) 
were treated (547 with nivolumab + ipilimumab, 535 with sunitinib).  
Blinding (masking) 
CA209214 was an open-label study.

Statistical methods 
ORR: For the intermediate/poor risk group, descriptive estimates of response rate, along with its exact 
two-sided 95% CI by Clopper-Pearson method, were computed within each treatment arm. A two 
sided 95% CI for difference of response rate between the treatment arms was also computed using 
Newcombe’s method. If the exact 95%-CIs did not overlap for the intermediate/poor risk, then 95% 
exact CIs among intermediate/poor/favourable was calculated and a 2-sided, 95% confidence interval 
for the difference of ORR between treatment arms was computed for all randomised subjects by the 
method of DerSimonian and Laird, using a fixed effects model (setting the random effect to zero), 
adjusting for the stratification factors. 
PFS: the primary (among intermediate/poor risk subjects) analysis of PFS (as determined by IRRC) 
was to compare the 2 treatment arms via two-sided 0.009 stratified log-rank test reporting a 
two-sided log-rank p-value. The estimate of the PFS hazard ratio, of nivolumab combined with 
ipilimumab to sunitinib monotherapy, was calculated using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model, 
with treatment as the sole covariate. Ties were handled using the Exact method. A two-sided, 99.1% 
CI for the hazard ratio was also presented. The method of Gail and Simon was used to test for a 
qualitative interaction between treatment and strata, IMDC prognostic risk score (1-2 vs. 3-6) and 
Region (US vs. Canada/W.Europe/N.Europe vs. ROW). This test was conducted at α= 0.10 level. The 
proportional hazards assumption was tested at 0.10 in a stratified Cox model by testing the a log(t) 
term. Sensitivity analyses included accounting for delayed effect by using a weighted log rank test (is 
primary if unstable than normal stratified test). The estimate of the PFS hazard ratio in the period 
following 6 months, of nivolumab combined with ipilimumab compared to sunitinib monotherapy, was 
calculated using a stratified time-dependent Cox model with effects for treatment and period-by-
treatment interaction. In this model, period is a binary variable indicating pre- vs. post- 6 months. The 
second line phase 3 mRCC study (CA209-025) served as the basis for the 6 month delayed treatment 
effect in PFS. Ties were handled using the exact method. A two-sided 99.1% CI for the hazard ratio 
was presented. Additionally, unstratified log-rank tests and unstratified Cox models (but adjusted for 
stratification factors i.e. assuming a common, not stratified baseline hazard), multivariate Cox-model, 
PFS by investigator, with CRF instead of IVRS values of the covariates, PFS for those without relevant 
deviations were investigated. 
The primary definition of PFS censors for new anti-cancer therapy, tumour-directed radiotherapy, or 
tumour-directed surgery without prior documented progression; the secondary definition of PFS does 
not. 
OS: Overall survival was compared between the treatment arms at the interim and final analyses, 
using stratified log-rank test. The stratification factors were those used in the analysis of PFS. An 
O’Brien and Fleming α-spending function was employed to determine the nominal significance levels 
for the interim (two interims: first at time of PFS analysis with around 58% of planned events, and 
second at 73% of planned events) and final analyses. The stratified hazard ratio between the 
treatment groups will be presented along with 100*(1- α)% CI (adjusted for interim). At the time of 
database lock, the actual number of deaths was 328 (51%) of the 639 total number of events. Similar 
methods were used to analyse OS except the O’Brien and Fleming adjusted α = 0.002 was applied. 
Therefore a two-sided, 99.8% CI for the hazard ratio was presented. In addition, two-sided p-value 
was also reported for the primary analysis of OS.

Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 1390 patients were enrolled in the study (Figure 12). Of the 1096 subjects randomised (550 
to nivolumab + ipilimumab, 546 to sunitinib), 1082 (98.7%) were treated (547 with nivolumab + 
ipilimumab, 535 with sunitinib). Of the 1096 subjects randomised, 847 subjects were randomised in 
the intermediate/poor-risk group (425 nivolumab + ipilimumab, 422 sunitinib). Of these 847 subjects 
randomised in the intermediate/poor-risk group, 839 subjects were treated (423 with nivolumab + 
ipilimumab, 416 with sunitinib). The primary objective was to study efficacy in the intermediate/poor-
risk subjects (Table 14).

Recruitment 
A total of 174 sites in 28 countries randomised subjects (Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, 
Canada, Chile, Colombia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, 
Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Poland, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Turkey, United 
Kingdom, and United States). Of the 1096 randomised subjects, 1082 were treated. The first patient 
first visit date was 16-Oct-2014 and the last patient randomisation date was 04-Mar-2016. The last 
patient last visit date (clinical cut-off date) was 26-Jun-2017. The cut-off date for the IRRC scans was 
07-Jul-2017. The clinical database lock for this CSR occurred on 07-Aug-2017 for the planned final 
analysis of co-primary endpoints of IRRC-assessed ORR and PFS in intermediate and poor-risk 
subjects, and the planned interim analysis of the co-primary OS endpoint in intermediate and poor-risk 
subjects. The independent DMC reviewed the interim OS data on 06-Sep-2017 and confirmed that the 
pre-specified boundary for OS was crossed. The DMC recommended the study be stopped early. 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol for this study was dated 17-Jul-2014. As of 07-Aug-2017, three global 
amendments, 10 country-specific amendments and 1 administrative letter were issued for this study. 
Global amendments can be seen in Table 15. 
Table 15 Global Changes to Protocol CA209214 
Baseline data 
Among intermediate/poor-risk subjects, the median age was 61.0 years and the majority of subjects 
were white and male. The majority of subjects had baseline KPS of 100 (Table 16, Table 17). 
Between the 2 treatment groups, 79.4% of subjects had 2 or more disease sites. The most common 
site of disease (target) was the lung (54.6% and 56.4%), followed by lymph node (33.6% and 
38.2%), and kidney (24.2% and 23.9%), in the nivolumab + ipilimumab and the sunitinib group, 
respectively.

Of the intermediate/poor-risk subjects who had a baseline tumour tissue sample tested for PD-L1, 
100/422 (23.7%) in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group and 114/420 (27.1%) in the sunitinib group 
had tumours that were positive for PD-L1 expression (≥ 1%) at baseline. 
Among intermediate/poor-risk subjects, consistent with the inclusion criteria, most (99.3% and 
99.5%) subjects in the nivolumab + ipilimumab and sunitinib groups, respectively, had received no 
prior anticancer therapy. A total of 0.5% of subjects in the nivolumab + ipilimumab and sunitinib 
groups, respectively, received prior systemic therapy in the adjuvant setting and 0.2% of subjects in 
the nivolumab + ipilimumab and no sunitinib subjects received prior systemic therapy in the 
neoadjuvant setting. The most frequent prior systemic cancer therapies in the nivolumab + ipilimumab 
and sunitinib groups were interferon and interferon alpha (0.2%) for both treatment groups and 
interleukin 2 (0.2%) in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group.

Outcomes and estimation 
In this study, 547 subjects received at least 1 infusion of nivolumab and ipilimumab, and 535 subjects 
received at least 1 dose of sunitinib (all treated subjects). In the nivolumab + ipilimumab group, 
87.6% and 80.3% of subjects received 90% to ≥ 110% of the planned dose intensity of nivolumab and 
ipilimumab, respectively (Table 19). In the sunitinib group, 54.0% of subjects received 90% to ≥110% 
of the planned dose intensity of sunitinib. In the nivolumab + ipilimumab group (intermediate/poor-
risk) 88.0% and 80.3% of subjects received 90% to ≥ 110% of the planned dose intensity of 
nivolumab and ipilimumab, respectively (Table 20). In the sunitinib group (intermediate/poor-risk), 
58.5% of subjects received 90% to ≥110% of the planned dose intensity of sunitinib. 
At the time of the final database lock (07-Aug-2017), the median duration of therapy was 7.85 months 
in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group, with a median of 14 nivolumab doses and 4 ipilimumab doses 
received, and 7.82 months in the sunitinib group, with a median daily dose of 31.33 mg/day (range 
14.2-50.0) received.

Subsequent therapy  
Subsequent therapy was received by 45.6% and 57.7% of subjects in the nivolumab + ipilimumab and 
sunitinib groups, respectively, including 39.5% and 54.0%, respectively, who received subsequent 
systemic cancer therapy (All treated subjects - Table 6.6-1 in CSR). In the nivolumab + ipilimumab 
group, 20.2% of subjects received subsequent treatment with sunitinib. In the sunitinib group, 28.2% 
of subjects received subsequent therapy with an anti-PD-1 pathway agent (nivolumab or 
pembrolizumab).  
Protocol deviations 
Relevant protocol deviations (significant protocol deviations that were programmable and could 
potentially affect the interpretability of the study) were reported in 2.4% of intermediate/poor-risk 
subjects (2.4 of subjects in eacht treatment group. Most common relevant protocol deviation at study 
entry was ‘subjects with a baseline IMDC score of <1’ (2.1% of intermediate/poor-risk subjects)  
(Table 21).

Overall survival 
OS results are presented for the intermediate/poor-risk, all randomised, and favourable-risk subjects. 
In intermediate/poor-risk subjects, nivolumab + ipilimumab demonstrated statistically significant and 
superior OS compared with sunitinib at the planned interim OS analysis (HR: 0.63 [99.8% CI: 0.44, 
0.89]; stratified log-rank 2-sided p-value < 0.0001) at the adjusted alpha of 0.002 (Figure 13, Table 
23). Upon request, the applicant provided an OS update (database lock 01-Mar-2018) (Figure 14). 
•  Median OS was not reached at the time of analysis in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group and was 
25.95 months in the sunitinib group (Figure 13). 
•  OS rates in the nivolumab + ipilimumab and the sunitinib groups, respectively, were 89.5% and 
86.2% at 6 months, and 80.1% and 72.1% at 12 months. 
•  The K-M curves for OS separated early, favouring nivolumab + ipilimumab (Figure 13). 
•  285 (67.1%) subjects in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group and 234 (55.5%) subjects in the 
sunitinib group were censored. At the time of database lock, a higher proportion of subjects in the 
nivolumab + ipilimumab group vs. the sunitinib group were still on treatment (24.2% vs. 13.5%), and 
a similar proportion were in follow-up (39.1% vs. 35.1%). 3.8% of subjects were off-study in the 
nivolumab + ipilimumab group and 6.9% in the sunitinib group.

In all randomised subjects, treatment with nivolumab + ipilimumab was statistically significant 
compared with sunitinib (HR = 0.68, 99.8% CI: 0.49, 0.95; p-value:  0.0003) at the adjusted alpha of 
0.002 (Figure 15, Table 24). Upon request, the applicant provided an OS update (database lock 01-
Mar-2018) (Figure 16). 
•  OS rates in the nivolumab + ipilimumab and the sunitinib groups, respectively, were 91.3% and 
89.3% at 6 months, and 83.1% and 77.4% at 12 months. 
•  389 (70.7%) subjects in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group and 342 (62.6%) subjects in the 
sunitinib group were censored. At the time of this database lock, a higher proportion of subjects in the 
nivolumab + ipilimumab group vs. the sunitinib group were still on treatment (23.3% vs. 17.8%), and 
a similar proportion were in follow-up (43.3% vs. 38.3%). 4.2% ofsubjects were off-study in the 
nivolumab + ipilimumab group and 6.6% in the sunitinib group.

Progression-free survival 
Progression-free survival per IRRC 
In intermediate/poor-risk subjects, the analysis of IRRC-assessed PFS (co-primary endpoint) using 
RECIST v1.1, and censoring for subsequent therapy (primary PFS definition) favoured nivolumab + 
ipilimumab vs. sunitinib (HR = 0.82, [99.1% CI: 0.64, 1.05], stratified 2-sided p-value = 0.0331) 
(Figure 19, Table 25). This difference did not meet the stringent pre-specified α = 0.009 for statistical 
significance. 
•  The median PFS was 11.56 months (95% CI: 8.71,15.51) in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group and 
8.38 months (95% CI: 7.03, 10.81) in the sunitinib group, representing a difference in median PFS of 
3.2 months (Figure 19). 
Assessment report  
EMA/902855/2019  
Page 60/176 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  The 12-month PFS rate was 49.6% in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group and 42.6% in the sunitinib 
group. Rates at 24-months were not available due to censoring at this later time point. 
•  The K-M curves overlapped until approximately 6-7 months and then separated, favouring 
nivolumab + ipilimumab (Figure 19). 
-  The piece-wise HR ≤ 6 months (HR = 0.90) and > 6 months (HR = 0.69) favours the nivolumab + 
ipilimumab treatment during the first 6 months and thereafter (S.5.1E -CSR). The weighted log-rank 
2-sided p-value = 0.0024. 
-  228 (53.6%) subjects had a PFS event in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group (197 progression and 
31 deaths) and 228 (54.0%) subjects had a PFS event in the sunitinib group (185 progression and 43 
deaths) (Table 25). 
•  Censoring for PFS per IRRC: 
-  46.4% and 46.0% of subjects in the nivolumab + ipilimumab and sunitinib groups, respectively, 
were censored. 
-  44.0% of subjects in the nivolumab + ipilimumab and 40.8% of subjects in the sunitinib group had 
their PFS time censored on date of last tumour assessment on-study or last assessment prior to 
subsequent anti-cancer therapy, including 14.8% of subjects in the nivolumab + ipilimumab and 
26.8% of subjects in the sunitinib group who were censored due to receiving subsequent anti-cancer 
therapy. 
-  The most common reason for censoring between the 2 groups was ‘received subsequent anti-cancer 
therapy’.

In all randomised subjects, IRRC-assessed PFS analysis was only for qualitative purposes due to 
hierarchical testing. 
•  PFS observed in all randomised subjects (with censoring for subsequent therapy), 
including favourable-risk subjects, showed HR=0.98, 99.1% CI: 0.79, 1.23, stratified log-
rank 2-sided p = 0.8498 in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group vs. the sunitinib group (Table 
7.4.1.1-2,Figure 20, Table 26). 
•  The median PFS was 12.42 months (95% CI 9.89-16.53) for nivolumab + ipilimumab and 12.32 
months (95% CI 9.79-15.24) for sunitinib (Table 26). 
•  The 12-month PFS rate was 50.6% in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group and 51.1% in the 
sunitinib. Rates at 24-months were not available due to censoring at this later time point. 
•  Among the 1096 randomised subjects, 567 subjects (51.7%) had PFS events. 
-  296 (53.8%) subjects had a PFS event in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group (259 progression and 
37 deaths) and 271 (49.6%) subjects had a PFS event in the sunitinib group (227 progression and 44 
deaths) (Table 26). 
•  46.2% and 50.4% of subjects in the nivolumab + ipilimumab and sunitinib groups, respectively, 
were censored. Most of these subjects were censored on date of last tumour assessment on-study or 
last assessment prior to subsequent anti-cancer therapy (44.0% in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group, 
44.7% in the sunitinib group), including 14.7% in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group and 26.6% in the 
sunitinib group who were censored due to subsequent anti-cancer therapy. The most common reason 
for censoring between the 2 groups was ‘received subsequent anti-cancer therapy.’

group (26.5% [95% CI: 22.4, 31.0]), with non-overlapping 95% CIs. The stratified difference in ORR 
(nivolumab + ipilimumab - sunitinib) was 16.0% (95% CI: 9.8, 22.2), p-value < 0.0001; see Table 27. 
-  BOR was CR in 9.4% of subjects in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group and 1.2% of subjects in the 
sunitinib group 
-  BOR was PR in 32.2% and 25.4% of subjects, respectively 
-  BOR was SD in 31.3% and 44.5% of subjects, respectively 
The waterfall plot for intermediate/poor-risk subjects showed a greater magnitude of target lesion 
tumour burden reductions in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group compared with the sunitinib group 
(Figure 22).

In intermediate/poor-risk subjects, OS favoured the nivolumab + ipilimumab group vs. the sunitinib 
group in all pre-defined subgroups (Figure 23). The CIs for the HRs in the majority of subgroups were 
wide due to small subgroup sizes. Results were similar in all randomised subjects (Figure 24).

Baseline PD-L1 expression in relation to overall survival 
In intermediate/poor-risk subjects, exploratory analyses were performed to investigate the effect of 
PD-L1 tumour expression on OS. 
•  Median OS for ≥ 1% PD-L1 tumour expression in nivolumab + ipilimumab subjects was not reached 
at the time of this report, and was 19.61 months in the sunitinib group (Figure 26). For nivolumab + 
ipilimumab vs. sunitinib for baseline PD-L1 tumour expression ≥ 1%, HR = 0.45 (95% CI: 0.29, 0.71) 
(Figure S.5.6A -CSR). 
•  Median OS for < 1% PD-L1 tumour expression in nivolumab + ipilimumab and sunitinib subjects 
was not reached at the time of this report. For nivolumab + ipilimumab vs. sunitinib for baseline PD-L1 
tumour expression < 1%, HR = 0.73 (0.56, 0.96). 
Figure 26 Overall Survival – For each PD-L1 Expression Results Group and for each PD-L1 
Status Group by Treatment – Intermediate/Poor-risk Subjects 
In all randomised subjects, including favourable risk, results of OS by baseline PD-L1 tumour 
expression were consistent with those in intermediate/poor-risk subjects (Figure 27, Figure 28). 
•  PD-L1 positive: HR (95% CI): 0.46 (0.29, 0.71) 
•  PD-L1 negative: HR (95% CI): 0.80 (0.62, 1.03) 
In an analysis of the predictive relationship of PD-L1 tumour expression for OS, OS was similar in all 
PD-L1 evaluable subjects with PD-L1 tumour expression ≥ 1% compared with those with PD-L1 tumour 
expression < 1% in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group (HR 0.93, 95% CI: 0.62, 1.39).

However, in the sunitinib group, OS was favoured in subjects with PD-L1 tumour expression < 1% 
compared to those with PD-L1 tumour expression ≥ 1% (HR 1.64, 95% CI: 1.20, 2.23; Table S.10.12-

Progression-free survival subgroup results 
Unweighted differences between treatment groups in PFS were analysed using the Cox model for PFS 
(time to events) endpoints to assess the impact of specific baseline characteristics.  
In intermediate/poor-risk subjects, the IRRC-assessed ORR using RECIST v1.1 favoured the nivolumab 
+ ipilimumab group vs. the sunitinib group in all pre-defined subgroups except for Black or African 
American, and Asian, time from initial diagnosis to randomisation (years) ≥ 1 year, and corrected 
calcium ≤ 10 mg/dl (Figure 31). The CIs for the odds ratios in the majority of subgroups were wide 
due to small subgroup sizes. 
Results were similar in all randomised subjects (Figure 32). [note: the labels for sunitinib and 
nivolumab + ipilimumab seem to be switched at the bottom of the forest plot (Figure 32), hazard 
ratios below 1 should be in favour of nivolumab+ ipilimumab instead of sunitinib. Information on the 
pre-defined patient subsets based on corrected calcium “yes” or “no”, respectively, was provided by 
the applicant upon request (Figure 33).

Baseline PD-L1 expression in relation to progression-free survival 
In intermediate/poor-risk subjects, exploratory analyses suggest that the improvement in PFS per 
IRRC with nivolumab + ipilimumab vs. sunitinib were more pronounced in subjects with PD-L1 tumour 
expression ≥ 1% (Figure 34). 
•  Median PFS was longer in nivolumab + ipilimumab subjects with ≥ 1% PD-L1 tumour expression 
than in sunitinib subjects (22.80 months vs. 5.85 months, respectively). 
•  Median PFS in nivolumab + ipilimumab subjects with < 1% PD-L1 tumour expression was 11.01 
months, and 10.41 months in sunitinib subjects. 
In all randomised subjects, including favourable risk, PFS was longer in nivolumab + ipilimumab 
subjects with ≥ 1% PD-L1 tumour expression than in sunitinib subjects (21.42 months vs. 6.83 
months, respectively). Refer to Figure S.10.7 in the CA209214 Final CSR. In nivolumab + ipilimumab 
subjects with < 1% PD-L1 tumour expression, PFS was shorter than in sunitinib subjects (11.56 
months vs. 15.24 months, respectively). The K-M plot of PFS for each PD-L1 expression group for 
favourable-risk subjects is provided in Figure S.10.7.2 in the CA209214 Final CSR.

Unweighted differences between treatment groups in ORR were analysed using the Newcombe method, 
to assess the impact of specific baseline characteristics. In intermediate/poor-risk subjects, the IRRC-
assessed ORR using RECIST v1.1 favored the nivolumab + ipilimumab group vs. the sunitinib group in 
all pre-defined subgroups except for Black or African American and corrected calcium ≤ 10 mg/dl 
(Figure 35). The CIs for the odds ratios in the majority of subgroups were wide due to small subgroup 
sizes. Results were similar in all randomised subjects (Figure 36). Information on the pre-defined

Baseline PD-L1 expression in relation to objective response rate 
In intermediate/poor-risk subjects, objective responses per IRRC were observed in the nivolumab + 
ipilimumab group regardless of PD-L1 tumour expression (Table 30).  
-  A higher ORR was observed in nivolumab + ipilimumab subjects than in sunitinib subjects, in both 
subjects with ≥ 1% PD-L1 tumour expression as well as those with < 1% PD-L1 tumour expression. 
In all randomised subjects, results of ORR by baseline PD-L1 tumour expression were consistent with 
those in intermediate/poor-risk subjects (Refer to Table S.10.11 in the CA209214 Final CSR). 
Table 30 Best Overall Response and Objective Response Rate per IRRC by Baseline 
PD-L1 Expression – Intermediate/Poor-risk Subjects 
In intermediate/poor-risk subjects, time to responses and duration of responses per IRRC were 
assessed in the nivolumab + ipilimumab and sunitinib groups regardless of PD-L1 tumour expression, 
and were determined to be consistent across PD-L1 tumour expression levels (Table 3.1.3.11-1 in the 
CA209214 Final CSR). 
- 
In the nivolumab + ipilimumab group vs. sunitinib, median TTR was similar for PD-L1 tumour 
expression level ≥1% 2.76 and 2.86 months, respectively. PD-L1 tumour expression level <1 resulted 
in a TTR of 2.83 and 4.01 in nivolumab+ipilimumab and sunitinib.  
- 
In the nivolumab + ipilimumab group, median DOR was not reached in subjects with PD-L1 tumour 
expression level <1% and ≥1%. In the sunitinib group, median DOR was 18.23 months in subjects 
with PD-L1 tumour expression < 1%. Median DOR was 17.22 months in subjects with PD-L1 tumour 
expression ≥ 1%. 
In all randomised subjects, results of TTR and DOR by baseline PD-L1 tumour expression were 
consistent with those in intermediate/poor-risk subjects (Refer to Table S.10.15.1 in the CA209214 
Final CSR).

Clinical studies in special populations 
In intermediate/poor-risk subjects, OS favoured the nivolumab + ipilimumab group vs. the sunitinib 
group in all pre-defined subgroups (Figure 19). However, this effect appeared to decrease with 
increasing age (age ≥65 and <75 – HR 0.86 [0.58, 1.27], age ≥75 – HR 0.97 [0.48, 1.95]). 
Supportive study 
Study CA209016 was a phase 1 open-label study of nivolumab plus sunitinib or pazopanib, or 
nivolumab plus ipilimumab in subjects with mRCC.  
Study objectives, methodology, number of subjects, diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion of the 
supportive study have been summarised in the dose response (4.4.1.) section of this report.  
Efficacy results 
Disposition of subjects 
The enrolment period lasted approximately 27.5 months (Feb 2012 to May 2014). The last patient 
started first dose on 29/5/2014, and the clinical cut-off date for the clinical study report (CSR) 
occurred on 16/3/2016, providing a minimum follow-up for survival of approximately 22 months. 
A total of 14 sites in 2 countries of North America enrolled and treated subjects. Of the 194 subjects 
enrolled, 153 (78.9%) were treated; 33 in arm S, 20 in arm P, 47 in Arm I-1, 47 in arm I-3, and 6 in 
Arm IN-3 (Table 5.1-1). Within arm S, 7 subjects were treated with sunitinib + nivolumab 2 mg/kg, 
and 26 were treated with sunitinib + nivolumab 5 mg/kg. All subjects in arm P received pazopanib + 
nivolumab 2 mg/kg.

A summary of the number of subjects enrolled, randomised and treated is presented in Table 32. 
Baseline demographic and characteristics 
Among all treated subjects, the majority of subjects were under the age of 65, white and male. At 
baseline, the majority of subjects were diagnosed with clear-cell RCC with KPS of 90 or 100, had 
favourable or intermediate-risk MSKCC prognostic scores and PD-L1 level ≤ 5%. The lung, lymph node 
and liver were the most common site of disease reported outside of the kidney (Table 33).

Prior treatment  
Among all treatment groups, over 97.9% of subjects received prior surgery; and 14.3 - 50% of 
subjects received prior radiotherapy (Table 33). 25 (53.2%), 21 (44.7%), and 3 (50.0%) of subjects in 
arms I-1, I-3, and IN-3 were treatment-naïve, respectively. Of all the subjects who were previously 
treated with systemic cancer therapy, most subjects received only 1 regimen.

Objective response rate 
The investigator-assessed confirmed ORR was 40.4% in arm I-1 (nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1 
mg/kg), 40.4% in arm I-3 (nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipilimumab 3 mg/kg). No confirmed ORR was found 
for arm IN-3 (Table 35). Five (10.6%) subjects in arm I-1 obtained a complete response. The response 
evaluable population remained the same as the efficacy population, hence no changes in sensitivity 
analysis results for the ORR.

Safety Results 
Safety results from study CA209016 are summarised in the section on dose response studies.  
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Study CA209214 was the main study submitted for the extension of indication to include combination 
treatment with nivolumab and ipilimumab in adult patients with intermediate/poor-risk advanced renal 
cell carcinoma. Study CA209016 was included to support the dose regimen ipilimumab 1 mg/kg + 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg in mRCC.  
Data to support ipilimumab 1 mg/kg + nivolumab 3 mg/kg in renal cell carcinoma 
Study CA209016 was performed to explore various combination regimens with nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab, namely nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipilimumab 3 mg/kg (arm I-3), nivolumab 3 mg/kg + 
ipilimumab 1 mg/kg (arm I-1) and nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab 3 mg/kg (arm IN-3) in subjects 
with advanced or metastatic RCC. The purpose of the study was to determine the maximum tolerated 
dose and the recommended phase 2 dose of the combination regimens. Because the number of 
patients in arm IN-3 was low – and probably MTD was reached – the main focus will be on the 
comparison between arm I-1 and arm I-3. Currently, nivolumab is indicated as second-line treatment 
in advanced renal cell carcinoma patients, with efficacy demonstrated on OS. Ipilimumab is not 
indicated for the treatment of advanced RCC and there are limited data from studies performed with 
Assessment report  
EMA/902855/2019  
Page 88/176 
 
 
 
 
 
ipilimumab in RCC patients. The combination therapy nivolumab + ipilimumab is indicated for the 
treatment of advanced melanoma. The recommended dose in melanoma patients is 1 mg/kg 
nivolumab in combination with 3 mg/kg ipilimumab for the first 4 doses, followed by 3 mg/kg 
nivolumab every 2 weeks. Thus, the approved doses of the ipilimumab and nivolumab combination in 
melanoma are different from those in the current application, i.e. ipilimumab – approved dose 3 mg/kg 
vs. the proposed dose of 1 mg/kg in the current application, and nivolumab approved dose 1 mg/kg 
vs. 3 mg/kg in the current application. 
In both arm I-1 and arm I-3, 47 subjects were enrolled; 6 patients were enrolled in arm IN-3. The 
majority of subjects where white males under the age of 65 with a KPS >90. Baseline patient 
demographics and characteristics were not balanced between arm I-1 and arm I-3, resulting in a 
suboptimal comparison of efficacy between the two arms. Arm I-1 contained patients who had more 
favourable prognostic factors for efficacy on different characteristics (refer to effects of these factors 
on efficacy in the main study; see forest plots), including more subjects below the age of 65 (91.5% 
vs. 76.6%), more patients with a Karnofsky Performance Status of 100 (61.7% vs. 42.6%) and more 
patients with PD-L1 expression ≥1% (40.4% vs. 29.8%). Thus, arm I-1 contained patients who might 
respond better to treatment compared to patients in arm I-3, hampering comparison of efficacy and 
most likely also safety. In addition, the cohorts of patients enrolled in arm I-1 and I-3 were a mix of 
previously treated and treatment-naïve patients, further complicating the comparison. MSKCC risk 
scores were similar between arms. The applicant explained that the KPS 90-100 patients are classified 
as ECOG 1 and that age is not incorporated in the IMDC prognostic model. It is agreed that small 
differences in KPS might not have a detrimental effect on efficacy/safety. However, based on the forest 
plots of ORR (Figure 35 and Figure 36) it seems that ORR is lower in patients above the age of 65 
compared to younger patients, thus the imbalance in age between arm I-1 and arm I-3 cannot be 
ignored. As a result, it remains unclear to which extent the imbalances in baseline characteristics will 
have an effect on anti-tumour activity and safety observed in arm I-1 and arm I-3.  
Safety/tolerability was the primary objective in study CA209016. Based on the safety results, arm I-1 
appeared to have a more favourable safety profile compared to arm I-3 (and arm IN-3). However, as 
discussed above, patient characteristics were not balanced between arms and therefore also 
comparison of safety is hampered. Frequently observed AEs in both arm I-1 and arm I-3, regardless of 
causality as well as drug-related, were consistent with the common AEs known for nivolumab + 
ipilimumab in melanoma. The amount of treatment-related AEs (grade 3-4) was higher in arm I-3 than 
in arm I-1. There were also more drug-related AEs (any grade) leading to discontinuation of treatment 
in arm I-3 compared to arm I-1. This was mainly due to the increased frequency of subjects in Arm I-3 
experiencing ALT increased, colitis and diarrhoea. The frequency of subjects experiencing SAEs was 
higher in arm I-3, whereas ALT increased, colitis and diarrhoea were observed most frequently and 
were all grade 3-4. Both the select AEs (any grade) and IMAEs (any grade) were more present in the 
arm I-3, except for renal select AE.  
Although these data suggest poorer tolerability with I-3 than with I-1, the imbalances in baseline 
characteristics hamper drawing definitive conclusions regarding tolerability of I-1 and I-3. 
When analysing the secondary objective of ORR, no clear differences were found in preliminary anti-
tumour activity between arm I-1 and arm I-3. The confirmed ORR was the same in arm I-1 and arm I-
3 (40.4%), but complete responses were only observed in the arm I-1 (10.6% vs. 0%). The duration 
of response was similar between arm I-1 and arm I-3, namely 88.7 weeks and 85.9 weeks, as well as 
the ongoing responses for both arms (42.1% vs. 36.8%). Therefore, arm I-1 and arm I-3 seemed 
comparable with regard to ORR. However, as outlined above, differences in baseline characteristics 
hamper drawing conclusions on relative efficacy of I-1 and I-3. No clear differences in PFS and OS 
were observed between the two arms. Importantly, it should be noted that both the I-1 arm and I-3 
arm included patients with favourable risk according to MSKCC, further limiting the possibility to make 
Assessment report  
EMA/902855/2019  
Page 89/176 
 
 
 
comparisons regarding the efficacy of I-1 and I-3 in the target population. In the subgroup of first-line 
patients with IMDC intermediate/poor risk (based on retrospective IMDC risk-score assignment - 17 
subjects in arm I-1 and 15 subjects in arm I-3 ), the ORR was slightly higher in arm I-3  (46.7%) 
compared to arm I-1 (41.1%) (data not shown). However, no complete responses were observed in 
arm I-3, while 2 subjects (11.8%) had a complete response in arm I-1. Efficacy for arm IN-3 was 
based on 6 subjects, but these did not obtain a confirmed ORR. PFS was 8.5 months and OS not 
reached. These results should be analysed with caution, as sample size was small and, in addition, five 
out of six of these patients had favourable risk. 
In conclusion, the applicant selected arm I-1 as the dosing schedule to be used in the pivotal study 
based on the more favourable safety profile of arm I-1 compared to arm I-3 and the lack of difference 
in observable anti-tumour activity between I-1 and I-3. However, sample sizes were small in the dose-
response study and imbalances in baseline characteristics hamper interpretation of the data for ORR, 
PFS and OS and the safety results.  
Importantly, the applicant did not compare the anti-tumour activity of the combination treatment with 
nivolumab monotherapy. Nivolumab has been shown to be effective in the target population, as it is 
approved for the treatment of advanced RCC after prior therapy in adults. In contrast, the benefit of 
ipilimumab is little characterised in the target population. In the guideline on the evaluation of 
anticancer medicinal products in man, it is stated that ‘‘In phase II, the new combination should be 
compared to both combination partners as single agents at efficacious doses and preferably a 
reference treatment: AB vs. A vs. B vs. reference treatment’’. Depending on the phase II results one or 
both monotherapy arms may be dispensable in phase III. In the pivotal study (CA209214) performed 
by the applicant, monotherapy arms are lacking, and the co-enhancement effect of combination 
therapy compared to nivolumab monotherapy has also not been demonstrated in phase I/II. The lack 
of demonstration of the contribution to efficacy of ipilimumab is considered an important issue, 
because the efficacy of nivolumab in RCC is evident, while the clinical benefit from ipilimumab in RCC 
has not been demonstrated. This is especially relevant considering that addition of ipilimumab leads to 
a more unfavourable safety profile than nivolumab monotherapy as shown by the applicant. In 
addition, the benefit/risk balance for ipilimumab monotherapy (MDX010-11) was not considered 
sufficiently favourable by the applicant to warrant further development in advanced RCC. The applicant 
included exposure-effect relationships to support the combination therapy by comparing the efficacy 
parameters (ORR and OS) for nivolumab monotherapy with the combination nivolumab + ipilimumab. 
However, it was unclear whether with the current dataset the contribution of each component to 
efficacy can be elucidated because of insufficient data on nivolumab c.q. ipilimumab monotherapy in 
first-line RCC and lack of data of the combination therapy in second-line RCC. This uncertainty was 
discussed by the applicant with the request for supplementary information. The applicant claims that 
the ORR of nivolumab monotherapy and ipilimumab monotherapy were not considered to be sufficient 
to warrant testing in a phase 3 randomised study in first-line advanced RCC patients. However, there 
is no clear correlation observed between ORR/PFS and OS for immune checkpoint inhibitors (PD-1, PD-
L1 and CTLA-4) (Kaufman et al. Journal of Oncology – abstract, Mushti et al. Clin Cancer Res. 2018). 
Real-world survival data of first-line nivolumab monotherapy in patients with RCC was provided. A 
small number of patients (n=32) was treated off-label with nivoluamb monotherapy (real-world data) 
and some of the patients in study CA209009 who received nivolumab were previous untreated (n=24). 
However, this concerns only a limited number of patients and cross-study comparison between these 
studies with study CA209214 has its limitations a.o. in terms of patient selection. Therefore, it cannot 
be determined whether an added benefit of ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab over nivolumab 
alone is obtained; the lack of demonstration of the contribution to efficacy of ipilimumab is considered 
a major issue. 
Assessment report  
EMA/902855/2019  
Page 90/176 
 
 
 
In addition, there are questions regarding the chosen dose of ipilimumab, i.e. 1 mg/kg. It is not clear 
whether 1 mg/kg ipilimumab contributes to clinical benefit in patients with RCC. Limited dose-response 
data for ipilimumab monotherapy in RCC are available. Study MDX010-11 was presented by the 
applicant to demonstrate that ipilimumab monotherapy has an effect in patients with stage IV RCC. 
One subject (5%) who received a single dose of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg followed by 1 mg/kg Q3W (cohort 
A) experienced a partial response out of the 21 subjects. Four subjects experienced a partial response 
(12.5%) of the 40 subjects who received a first dose of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg followed by 3 mg/kg Q3W 
(cohort B). Duration of response in the single patient in cohort A was 18 months, and 7.8 months in 
cohort B (Yang et al. J Immunother. 2007;30: 825-830). In both cohorts, patients started with a dose 
of 3 mg/kg ipilimumab, and dosing schedules containing only 1 mg/kg ipilimumab appear not to have 
been tested in RCC patients as concluded from the data submitted by the applicant. 
As a result, the dose-response relationship of ipilimumab in RCC is poorly defined, and it cannot be 
concluded that 1 mg/kg ipilimumab contributes to a relevant extent to efficacy. Especially in view of 
the additional toxicity that is conferred by ipilimumab, this is considered another important uncertainty 
in the dossier. In the second round, the applicant provided data regarding the dose-dependent 
increase in peripheral blood absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC), which has been observed in phase 
II/III melanoma studies. However, ALC is not a validated surrogate marker for clinical benefit. Further, 
as elaborated by the applicant, study CA209016 aimed to show the anti-tumour response for first-line 
intermediate/poor-risk subjects. Anti-tumour effect observed in study CA209016 for the combination 
therapy does not mean that there will be an added benefit of ipilimumab per se, due to the lack of a 
head-to-head comparison with nivolumab monotherapy. Besides, due to the imbalances in baseline 
characteristics in study CA209016, it remains difficult to compare anti-tumour activity between arm I-1 
and I-3. Whether 1 mg/kg ipilimumab contributes to efficacy of the combination therapy cannot be 
determined. This means that the MO remains unresolved. What is further notable, is that the dose-
response data for ipilimumab that are available in melanoma patients show that 1 mg/kg ipilimumab 
might be on a low part of the dose-response curve (Figure 10). A statistically significant trend 
(p=0.0015) between increasing dose and higher best overall response was found in melanoma (EPAR 
of Yervoy; EMA/CHMP/557664/2011). This dose-response relationship was confirmed in a comparative 
phase 3 study comparing ipilimumab 3 mg/kg with 10 mg/kg monotherapy for treatment of 
melanoma, which showed a statistically significantly longer overall survival for 10 mg/kg compared to 
3 mg/kg ipilimumab (EMEA/H/C/002213/II/0042). 
For nivolumab, it is known that in RCC the dose-efficacy relationship is flat between 1 mg/kg and 10 
mg/kg. Also for toxicity there appears to be no difference between 1 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg. The dose of 
nivolumab is therefore not questioned. 
CA209214 - Main study  
Study CA209214 was a randomised, open-label, phase III study, comparing nivolumab + ipilimumab 
with sunitinib. The administered dose of the combination regimen was nivolumab 1 mg/kg + 
ipilimumab 3 mg/kg for 4 doses followed by nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks, based on the results of 
the dose response study CA209016. As outlined above, it can not be concluded what the single agent 
contribution of ipilimumab is regarding the observed anti-tumour activity and clinical benefit, and 
whether 1 mg/kg ipilimumab is an efficacious dose. The dose of sunitinib was 50 mg taken orally once 
daily, for 4 consecutive weeks, followed by a 2 week rest period to comprise a complete cycle of 6 
weeks, which is the recommended dose for mRCC (Sutent SmPC).

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Subjects were ≥18 years of age with previously untreated advanced RCC (not amenable for surgery or 
radiotherapy) or mRRC, with a clear-cell component. No patients with non-clear cell RCC were treated 
with nivolumab + ipilimumab. However, restrictions to the indication based on histology subtype are 
not deemed appropriate in this case because in view of the mechanism of action of the combination it 
is not expected that efficacy is restricted to the clear-cell histological subtype. This is confirmed by 
available data showing efficacy of nivolumab in non-clear cell RCC (e.g. Koshkin et al. 2017, JCO 35, 
no. 15_suppl p.4586-4586) and has a regulatory precedent (nivolumab in the second line treatment of 
RCC; EMEA/H/C/003985/II/0008). The lack of clinical data for nivolumab plus ipilimumab in patients 
with non-clear cell RCC should be mentioned in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  Prior systemic therapy was 
not permitted except for one prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy, not including agents that target 
VEGF or VEGF receptors. The patient population was adequate and inclusion/exclusion criteria are 
acceptable, although the list of exclusion criteria was relatively long.  However, this is understood, 
since these criteria are related to three drugs that patients were potentially eligible for (sunitinib, 
ipilimumab, and nivolumab). CA209214 was an open-label study. As nivolumab and ipilimumab are 
administered intravenously and sunitinib orally, and the known safety profiles of sunitinib and 
nivolumab+ipilimumab are very different, it is understood that an open-label study instead of a blinded 
study was performed. Since OS is the main endpoint of interest, no relevant bias due to the open-label 
design is expected.  
Of these 1096 subjects, 547 subjects received nivolumab + ipilimumab and 535 subjects received 
sunitinib (all randomised subjects).  
Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were balanced for the nivolumab+ipilimumab and 
the sunitinib arms (all randomised subjects, as well as intermediate/poor-risk subjects). Stratification 
was based on region (US vs. Canada/Western Europe/Northern Europe vs. Rest of World) and IMDC 
prognostic score (0 vs. 1-2 vs. 3-6), which is acceptable. PD-L1 expression was not used as a 
stratification factor, but expression appeared balanced between study arms. The MAH states that 
sunitinib is currently a widely used standard-of-care agent in the selected patient population. Indeed, 
standard first-line treatment of patients with favourable or intermediate prognosis is with sunitinib or 
pazopanib and for poor-risk patients both temsirolimus or VEGF inhibitors can be used. Therefore, 
sunitinib is considered acceptable as comparator in favourable, intermediate and poor-risk patients.  
Relevant protocol deviations were reported in 2.4% of patients in each study arm from the 
intermediate/poor-risk population. One patient in each study arm has a baseline KPS<70, 1 patient in 
the sunitinib arm had no confirmed histology of RCC and 9 patients and 8 patients in the nivo+ipi and 
sunitinib arm, respectively, had a baseline IDMC score <1, but were however included in the 
intermediate/poor-risk population. It is unlikely that this had any impact on study results.  
Dose reductions and increases were allowed for subjects receiving sunitinib, while no dose reductions 
and increases were allowed in subjects receiving nivolumab and ipilimumab. A lower proportion of 
subjects received 90% to 110% of the planned dose in the sunitinib arm, namely 54.0% for sunitinib 
and 87.6% and 80.3 % for nivolumab + ipilimumab, respectively. The number of dose delays was 
highest for ipilimumab, mainly caused by adverse events. Patients (all treated) in the sunitinib arm 
received more subsequent therapy compared to nivolumab + ipilimumab (57.7% vs. 45.6%). Patients 
in the sunitinib arm mainly received nivolumab or pembrolizumab as subsequent systemic treatment 
(28.2%) and patients in the nivolumab + ipilimumab arm mainly received sunitinib as subsequent 
treatment (20.2%). The number of patients (intermediate/poor-risk) receiving subsequent therapy was 
higher in the sunitnib group compared to the nivolumab+ipilimumab group (55.21% vs. 40.47%). 
Common subsequent therapies in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group were suntinib (20.47%), 
pazopanib (13.18%) and axitinib (12.94%). Common subsequent therapies for the sunitinib group 
Assessment report

Page 92/176 
 
 
 
were nivolumab (27.96 %), axitinib 20.62 and evirolimub (10.19%). It is not expected that 
subsequent therapy hinders the interpretation of the primary objectives of the study.  
One of the six prognostic factors determining the RCC risk groups (favourable, intermediate or poor) of 
the subjects was not reported in approximately 80% of the patients in each arm, i.e. corrected 
calcium. It is expected that the calcium levels were known at the time of randomisation, since the lack 
of corrected calcium data would bias the enrolment of patients in their corresponding cohort 
(poor/intermediate-risk or favourable-risk). If not available, then IMDC risk group could not have been 
adequately determined, which would be a major issue because the target population is defined based 
on IMDC risk score. The applicant was asked to confirm whether corrected calcium was available at the 
time of randomisation, report calcium levels, and discuss whether any patients were misclassified 
according to IMDC risk score. The applicant clarified that all 6 components of the IMDC risk score, 
including corrected calcium, were known at the time of randomisation in the 1096 randomised 
subjects.  
Protocol amendments 
By means of amendment 13 (4-Aug-2016) ORR was included as the third co-primary endpoint of trial 
with an “administrative” allocation of alpha=0.001. As the overall alpha for this study was 0.05, which 
was split in 0.001 to evaluate ORR, 0.009 to evaluate PFS and 0.04 to evaluate OS, it is important to 
know that the addition of ORR as co-primary endpoint did not change the alpha to evaluate OS 
determined at primary analysis. Based on the original study protocol (submitted by the applicant on 
request), it appeared that the inclusion of ORR did not affect the conclusions regarding OS, as the 
alpha of OS was 0.04 and the alpha of PFS was 0.01 both in the original protocol and the last version 
of the protocol. An interim analysis was performed on ORR (merely descriptive) on 14-Nov-2016, thus 
3 months after protocol amendment 13. Taking into account that this was an open-label study, the 
integrity of data and the rationale for protocol amendment 13 just before data cut-off for the interim 
analysis for ORR should be further justified. The applicant mentioned that the reason for adding ORR 
as primary endpoint was based on communication with the United States (US) Food and Drug 
Administration in April 2016 for a different tumour type, which supported the potential for accelerated 
approval in the US. The late inclusion of ORR as a primary endpoint raised initially concerns due to the 
open-label design of the study, but importantly, the inclusion of ORR as co-primary endpoint did not 
influence statistical evaluation of OS, as the 0.04 alpha for overall survival was preserved.  
The timing of the PFS analysis was advanced due to slowing number of PFS events. Although not 
stated explicitly, this has probably been done blinded as the study blind was not broken, and this is 
considered acceptable. 
Statistical methods 
The primary objective of the study was to describe OS, PFS, and ORR in intermediate/poor-risk 
subjects. The applicant pragmatically decided a priori to focus their primary analysis on the 
poor/intermediate risk group, because the inclusion of this subset of subjects allowed for potential 
differences in efficacy to be detected earlier than if favourable-risk patients were included. 
The secondary objective of the study was to describe OS, PFS, and ORR in all treated subjects. OS, 
PFS, and ORR in favourable-risk subjects was added as an exploratory objective. ORR, OS, PFS were 
not co-primary endpoints in the usual sense (EMA/CHMP/44762/2017), as they do not all need to be 
statistically significant as they all had their own type I error (0.001, 0.04, 0.009). No formal testing 
was defined for ORR (only descriptive exact 95%-CI for the ORR in each arm, a descriptive 95%-CI for 
the difference, and an ‘administrative’ alpha=0.001), so ORR cannot be formally statistically 
significant.

EMA/902855/2019  
Page 93/176 
 
 
 
The confidence interval of 95% in the updated OS K-M is not in line with the earlier used confidence 
interval, namely 99.8%. Applicant explained that the primary analysis used 99.8% confidence intervals 
(CIs) to adjust the type 1 error at the time of the interim analysis based on the pre-specified alpha 
spending function. The follow-up analyses are considered exploratory so the 95% CI is used for the 
hazard ratio in the overall survival (OS) Kaplan-Meier plot. Updated figures were also provided. 
The primary definition of the PFS analysis censored for start of new cancer-directed therapy, so is not 
the recommended PFS analysis (EMA/CHMP/27994/2008/Rev.1), although the secondary definition is 
in line.  
Sample size calculations reflect that the primary analysis population is a mixture (different median OS 
and PFS in the control arm for the poor versus the intermediate risk population assumed). 
Multiplicity was controlled via alpha splitting for the three primary endpoints and group sequential 
testing (OS had two interim and one final analysis). The statistical tests and estimation methods (for 
the proportions such as ORR and time-to-event outcomes such as OS) are considered standard and 
well-accepted.   
Efficacy – Intermediate/poor-risk subjects 
In the primary efficacy population of patients with intermediate/poor-risk, a statistically significant 
difference in OS was found between the nivolumab + ipilimumab group and the sunitinib group, 
favouring the nivolumab + ipilimumab group (HR 0.63 [99.8 CI: 0.44,0.89] , p-value:<0.0001). The 
median OS for the sunitinib arm was 25.95 months, whereas the median OS in the nivolumab + 
ipilimumab group was not reached. At approximately 3 months the K-M curves separated, favouring 
the nivolumab + ipilimumab group. The amount of censoring was high in the tail of the K-M curves, 
starting at month 20. The applicant provided an update of the OS data based on a database lock of 01-
Mar-2018. No changes in K-M curves are observed in the updated OS curves for patients with 
intermediate and poor-risk RCC, and the OS benefit remains – as expected – in favour of ipilimumab + 
nivolumab. 
The significant effect on OS was not fully supported by PFS, as PFS was not statistically significant in 
the nivolumab + ipilimumab group compared with the sunitinib group (HR 0.82 [99.1% CI: 0.64 – 
1.05], p-value 0.0331). Nevertheless, the numerical benefit of ipilimumab + nivolumab over sunitinib 
might still be clinically relevant. A difference of more than three months was found for the median PFS 
of nivolumab+ipilimumab compared to sunitinib. Piecewise HR for ≤6 months and >6 months favoured 
nivolumab +ipilimumab, with a HR of 0.90 and 0.69, respectively.  
The IRRC-assessed ORR was higher in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group (41.6% [95% CI: 36.9, 
46.5]) than in the sunitinib group (26.5% [95% CI: 22.4, 31.0]). A stratified difference in ORR was 
observed (16% [95% CI: 9.8,22.2], p-value: <0.0001, but no test prespecified so formally not 
significant), favouring the nivolumab + ipilimumab arm. Both complete responses and partial 
responses were obtained more frequently in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group compared with the 
sunitinib group. The time to response was shorter for the nivolumab + ipilimumab group compared to 
sunitinib group (3.42 months vs. 4.77 months). The duration of response was not reached (95% CI: 
21.28, N.A months) for the nivolumab + ipilimumab group and was 20.96 months (95% CI: 18.17, 
N.A.) for the sunitinib group.

Efficacy – Favourable-risk patients 
Based on the exploratory endpoints in the favourable cohort, no clinical benefit from the combination 
treatment was observed. OS, PFS and ORR all appeared to favour the sunitinib arm. A numerical 
difference in OS was observed, favouring sunitinib (HR 1.45 [descriptive 99.8% CI: 0.51, 4.12], p-
value: 0.2715), however follow-up was too short to definitively determine effects of the treatments on 
OS. The median OS was not reached for the nivolumab + ipilimumab arm and the median OS of the 
sunitinib arm (32.92 months) is not precise due to the large extent of censoring at the K-M tail. There 
were few events observed in the favourable-risk subjects (37/249). Upon request, the applicant 
provided an update of OS in favourable-risk subjects (database lock 01-Mar-2018). The numerical 
difference between both groups remained in favour of suntinib, but the number of events observed in 
these groups was low.  A benefit in PFS was seen for sunitinib (HR 2.18 [descriptive 99.1%CI: 1.29, 
2.68]). The median PFS difference between the arms was approximately 9 months. The curves 
separated after 3 months favouring sunitinib. The stratified difference in ORR was -23.0% with a P 
value of 0.0002, favouring sunitinib. Sunitinib had a longer duration of response in the favourable 
group compared to the intermediate/poor-risk group (23.49 months vs. 18.18 months). The median 
duration for nivolumab + ipilimumab in both the intermediate/poor-risk group and favourable-risk 
group was not reached. Median time to response was increase in the favourable group for both 
ipilimumab + nivolumab (2.79 months vs. 3.86 months) and sunitinib (3.04 months vs. 5.55 months) 
compared to the intermediate/poor-risk group. Although the favourable-risk group was an exploratory 
endpoint, nivolumab + ipilimumab was not superior to sunitinib for OS, PFS or ORR. The sample size 
was low and follow-up period was short, but favourable-risk patients seemed to benefit more from 
sunitinib therapy than from ipilimumab + nivolumab. These findings should be clearly reported in the 
product information(s) in order to inform physicians (see SmPC). 
Effects in subgroups – Intermediate/poor-risk subjects  
Subgroup analyses were performed in intermediate/poor-risk subjects and all-treated subjects. The 
unweighted difference in OS and PFS favoured the nivolumab + ipilimumab in almost all 
subpopulations. For ORR, Black and African American race and ≤10 mg/dl corrected calcium seemed to 
favour sunitinib. For PFS, Black and African American race, Asian race, year to initial diagnosis to 
randomisation (years) ≥ 1 year and corrected calcium ≤ 10 mg/dl seemed to favour sunitinib. 
However, this effect does not seem to be convincing, as samples sizes were small, confidence intervals 
wide and sometimes subpopulations borderline favoured sunitinib. Most subpopulations favoured 
nivolumab+ipilimumab for OS. However, different subgroups had hazard ratios close to 1, suggesting 
limited additional benefit compared to sunitinib.  Since serum albumin was not specified as a 
mandatory laboratory test at cycle 1, serum albumin levels were missing in > 80% of randomised 
subjects. The applicant provided adjusted forest plots with the ‘‘yes’’ / ‘‘no’’ data on corrected calcium. 
There seems to be only a small difference in point estimates for OS HR between patients with 
corrected calcium > 10 mg/dL or ≤10 mg/dL, both in favour of nivolumab + ipilimumab. Notably, it 
can be seen that patients with age>65 years and patients with KPS <90 had a HR close to 1. Thus, the 
benefit of nivolumab + ipilimumab is less obvious in these subpopulations. Patients >65 years of age 
appear to benefit somewhat less from the combination therapy versus sunitinib compared to younger 
patients, especially patients age ≥75, although benefit from the combination therapy in these patients 
appears comparable to patients treated with sunitinib. However, the number of patients with age ≥75 
included in the study was small and therefore estimates are relatively imprecise. The applicant showed 
that patients with a KPS = 80 drove the HR towards 1 in the forest plots and that this might be due to 
chance. As the point estimate of KPS<80 favours nivolumab + ipilimumab, it is likely that the obtained 
HR for patients with KPS=80 is an outlier. Also, the benefit of the combination therapy still borderline 
favours nivolumab + ipilimumab for KPS <90. SmPC includes information regarding elderly (age ≥75).

When comparing IMDC risk groups, it can be seen that the subgroup most favouring the combination 
therapy vs. sunitinib is the poor-risk group, followed by the intermediate-risk group (for OS, PFS and 
ORR).  
PD-L1 expression 
Effects of PD-L1 expression are not conclusive, i.e. due to limitations in the methodology of scoring PD-
L1 expression (e.g. not scoring immune cell expression).  No quantitative evaluation of immune cell 
expression of PD-L1 was performed in study CA209214, but the applicant will re-score PD-L1 stained 
samples in a post hoc evaluation (expected availability date: March 2019). It can be seen, however, 
that sunitinib performs worse at PD-L1<1% compared to PD-L1 ≥1%. PD-L1 expression seems to 
predict worse prognosis in advanced RCC patients treated with anti-angiogenesis drugs, as patients 
with high PD-L1 expression had a worse OS outcome according to literature (Choueiri et al. Clin Cancer 
Res. 2015), which is in line with the obtained results for the sunitinib group in this study. For 
intermediate/poor-risk subjects, OS by baseline PD-L1 ≥1% expression favoured 
nivolumab+ipilimumab  (HR: 0.45 [95% CI: 0.29, 0.71]). This was also observed in subjects with PD-
L1 <1% expression, but the HR was closer to 1 compared to PD-L1 ≥1% expression (HR: 0.73 [95% 
CI: 0.56, 0.96]) In the favourable risk group, it can be seen that this increased effect in subjects with 
PD-L1 ≥1 expression is mostly caused by the steeper decrease in OS K-M curve in sunitinib for 
subjects with PD-L1 ≥1%. In intermediate/poor-risk subjects with PD-L1<1% expression, no difference 
in PFS was observed between nivolumab + ipilimumab and sunitinib (HR: 1.06 [95% CI: 0.87, 1.36]). 
For subjects with PD-L1 ≥1% expression, however, a strong PFS benefit was observed for nivolumab + 
ipilimumab (HR: 0.47 [95% CI: 0.34, 064]). This effect was also caused by the decrease in PFS 
observed in the sunitinib arm for intermediate/poor-risk subjects with PD-L1 expression ≥1%. A 
benefit in ORR in the nivolumab + ipilimumab arm was observed regardless of PD-L1 expression in 
intermediate/poor-risk subjects. The ORR of sunitinib was lower in subjects with PD-L1 ≥1% than in 
patients with PD-L1 <1%.  
Several additional, potentially more relevant biomarkers for nivolumab + ipilimumab efficacy are 
available, including tumour mutational burden, tumour infiltrating lymphocytes, myeloid-derived 
suppressor cells in peripheral blood, gene expression profiling, single nucleotide polymorphism in 
immune-related genes, and correlations between routine lab values and efficacy (e.g. blood 
lymphocyte counts, neutrophil counts, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio). These biomarker analyses were 
planned to be analysed by the applicant. Upon request for supplementary information, the applicant 
provided additional OS data in relation to myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) expression and 
neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLC). It has been observed in mRCC patients that baseline MDSC might 
have a prognostic value able to predict OS, whereas a lower MDSC results in a more favourable clinical 
benefit, which is also observed in the Figure 29 (Mizuno et al. Cancer Sci. 2017). The OS benefit of 
nivolumab + ipilimumab compared to sunitinib is observed in subjects with low MDSC expression, 
intermediate MDSC expression and subjects with high MDSC expression.  
An analysis was conducted with available peripheral absolute lymphocyte and neutrophil counts. For 
NLR, it seems that a favourable OS is observed regardless of neutrophils to lymphocytes ratio, 
although the benefit was less pronounced for neutrophils to lymphocyte ratio <3. Based on literature, 
it seems that high neutrophil- to-lymphocyte ratio correlates to a worse treatment outcome, which is 
not observed in study CA209214 (Sacdalan et al. OncoTargets and Therapy. 2018). Data regarding 
immune profiling in the tumor by IHC was not presented by the applicant due to insufficient tumor 
tissue material. 
Several analysis were asked that have not been submitted yet and it is expected that these data will 
be available March 2019. This data could be provided as post-marketing measure, including all 
relevant biomarker data by March 2019.

Additional Biomarkers: 
The applicant is committed to submit biomarker data - including tumour infiltrating lymphocytes - will 
be provided by March 2019. The applicant mentions that the remaining samples for biomarker analysis 
will be used for analysis of CD8 in tumour tissue, which will be available for only a subset of patients. 
These biomarker data are considered of importance in the discussion on the identification upfront of 
those patients that benefit most of the treatment. 
Patient-reported outcomes (EQ-5D, FACT-G and FKSI-9) – exploratory endpoints 
EQ-5D, FACT-G and NCCN patient-reported outcomes were included to analyse health-related quality 
of life and patient-reported symptoms. The applicant described that across all 3 patient-reported 
scales, the nivolumab + ipilimumab group reported numerically higher cores compared to baseline 
scores and the sunitinib group. However, only small differences were observed between the outcomes 
and it was not clearly defined in the CSR which the difference in PRO outcome can be considered a 
clinically relevant difference. Also, after one year the number of subjects included in the PRO 
assessments was decreased more than 50 percent, while the number of completed questionnaires was 
even less. In light of these observations, it was not clear what the clinical relevance is of the PRO 
results. The applicant provided additional data regarding the PRO studies. For the FKSI-19 and the 
FACT-G, mean scores were numerically different between the sunitinib group and the ipilimumab + 
nivolumab group, favouring nivolumab + ipilimumab. The applicant’s objective was to evaluate disease 
related symptoms with the FKSI-19. However, the FKSI-19 is not considered optimal to compare the 
two treatment groups, as the treatment side effects subscale of the questionnaire is developed by 
input of patients treated with chemotherapy. The items in the questionnaire related to side effects are 
referring to side effects (fatigue, nausea and diarrhea) more frequently observed with sunitinib than 
nivolumab + ipilimumab, which might drive the treatment side effect score.  
The mean score of the FACT-G favours nivolumab + ipilimumab compared to sunitinib, but the 
difference is less noticeable than the difference observed with the FKSI-19. It is not clear whether this 
mean difference was also clinically relevant and remains difficult to interpret with the open-label study 
design. The applicant did not discuss EQ-5D-3L, but based on the differences in mean score between 
nivolumab + ipilimumab and sunitinib, it seems that no clinically relevant difference was found with 
this questionnaire. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In the pivotal study, nivolumab + ipilimumab showed improved efficacy compared to sunitinib in 
previously untreated intermediate/poor-risk advanced RCC patients. A statistically significant and 
clinically relevant OS benefit was observed for intermediate/poor-risk subjects treated with nivolumab 
+ ipilimumab compared to sunitinib. The OS data was supported by numerical benefits in PFS and 
ORR. Benefit of the combination therapy was not observed in favourable-risk patients, in whom 
sunitinib resulted in a numerically better outcome.  
A major issue in the current dossier is that the contribution of ipilimumab (in the studied dose) to the 
efficacy of the combination therapy has not been demonstrated, whereas it is clear that addition of 
ipilimumab leads to a more unfavourable safety profile. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Assessment report  
EMA/902855/2019  
Page 97/176 
 
 
 
This section describes the safety data from Study CA209214, a phase 3, randomised, open-label study 
of nivolumab combined with ipilimumab vs. sunitinib monotherapy. The posology in this study is in line 
with the proposed use of nivolumab 3 mg/kg combined with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg at the proposed 
schedule of every 3 weeks (Q3W) for 4 doses followed by nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W) for 
the treatment of adult patients with intermediate/poor-risk (per International Metastatic RCC Database 
Consortium criteria) advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (American Joint Committee on Cancer stage 
IV). 
Safety data are presented here for the primary safety population (all treated subjects), nivolumab + 
ipilimumab group (N = 547 subjects treated) vs. the sunitinib monotherapy treatment group (N = 535 
subjects treated), based on the 07-Aug-2017 final analysis database lock (DBL). The all treated 
population was the primary population for safety analyses to maximise the size of the safety database. 
In addition, safety data are presented for treated subjects in the primary efficacy population 
(intermediate/poor-risk subjects) in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group (N = 423) vs. the sunitinib 
monotherapy treatment group (N = 416). Safety data from the supportive Phase 1 study, CA209016, 
are not summarised here, a brief summary of safety in study CA209016 is provided in the section on 
dose response studies. Importantly, the main study is considered most representative for the target 
population and the safety data from the supportive study show a similar safety profile of nivolumab + 
ipilimumab as in the main study. 
Patient exposure 
Safety analyses were conducted in all 1082 treated subjects in study CA2092141 who received at least 
1 dose of study drug. Safety presentations of AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, select AEs, 
and laboratory abnormalities are based on all treated subjects (including favourable risk patients) 
unless stated otherwise, using a safety window of 30 days after last dose received.  
Demographic and Other Characteristics of Study Population 
Among all randomised subjects, baseline demographic, disease characteristics, and tumour 
assessments were well balanced between the nivolumab + ipilimumab and sunitinib groups (refer to 
section on clinical efficacy). Among intermediate/poor-risk subjects, baseline demographic, disease 
characteristics, and tumour assessments were consistent with those in all randomised subjects.  
Patient exposure 
A total of 547 subjects received at least 1 infusion of nivolumab and ipilimumab, and 535 subjects 
received at least 1 dose of sunitinib. In the nivolumab + ipilimumab group, 87.6% and 80.3% of 
subjects received 90% to ≥110% of the planned dose intensity of nivolumab and ipilimumab, 
respectively. In the sunitinib group, 54.0% of subjects received 90% to ≥110% of the planned dose 
intensity of sunitinib. The higher proportion of subjects receiving ≥90% of the planned dose intensity 
of nivolumab and ipilimumab than sunitinib can be explained by allowed dose reductions and increases 
of sunitinib per protocol, while these were not allowed for nivolumab or ipilimumab. 
At the time of final DBL, the median duration of therapy was 7.85 months in the nivolumab + 
ipilimumab group, with a median of 14 nivolumab doses and 4 ipilimumab doses received, and 7.82 
months in the sunitinib group, with a median daily dose of 31.33 mg/day (range: 14.2 - 50.0) 
received. 
Dose Modifications and Delays 
Most treated subjects in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group received all doses of study medication 
without an infusion interruption or infusion rate reduction, or dose delay. Reasons for infusion

interruption and infusion rate reduction in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group are provided in (Table 
38). 
Table 38 Infusion Interruptions and Infusion Rate Reductions - All Treated 
Subjects in the Nivolumab + Ipilimumab group 
Infusion interruptions: 29 (5.3%) subjects in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group had a nivolumab 
infusion interruption and 5 (0.9%) subjects had an ipilimumab infusion interruption. Of the subjects 
who required an infusion interruption, most had only 1 infusion interrupted. Infusion rate reductions: 
2.0% of nivolumab + ipilimumab subjects had a nivolumab infusion rate reduction and 1.8% of 
nivolumab + ipilimumab subjects had an ipilimumab infusion rate reduction. 
Dose delay information for the nivolumab + ipilimumab and sunitinib groups is provided in (Table 39).

Assessment report

Dose delays: Of subjects who experienced dose delays, most experienced only 1 delay: 152 out of 319 
subjects experienced at least 1 nivolumab dose delay; 134 out of 148 subjects experienced at least 1 
ipilimumab dose delay; and 123 out of 315 subjects experienced at least 1 sunitinib dose delay. The 
majority of dose delays were ≤ 14 days. The most common reason for dose delays was an AE 
(accounting for 65.8% of all delayed nivolumab doses; 85.3% of all delayed ipilimumab doses; and 
67.7% of all delayed sunitinib doses). Dose reductions: In the sunitinib group, 52.9% of subjects 
required a dose reduction; dose reductions were not permitted with nivolumab + ipilimumab 
treatment. 
Adverse events  
The all treated population was the primary population for safety analyses and is presented below. The 
safety profile of nivolumab + ipilimumab therapy in intermediate/poor-risk subjects is described at the 
end of the clinical safety section. 
Common Adverse Events 
In all treated subjects, the overall frequency of any-grade AEs (regardless of causality) were >90% in 
both treatment groups. The frequencies of Grade 3-4 AEs and drug-related AEs (any grade and Grade 
3-4) were numerically lower in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group than in the sunitinib group.  
Adverse Events (Regardless of Causality) 
Any-grade AEs (regardless of causality) were reported in 99.5% of subjects in the nivolumab + 
ipilimumab group and 99.4% of subjects in the sunitinib group (Table 40).

The overall frequency of AEs (regardless of causality) leading to a dose delay or reduction was 53.6% 
in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group and 43.2% in the sunitinib group. 
Late-Emergent Adverse Events 
Late-emergent drug-related AEs were defined as drug-related AEs with an onset date > 100 days after 
the last dose of study therapy. In the nivolumab + ipilimumab group, 20 (3.7%) subjects had late-
emergent drug-related AEs (Table S.6.6 of the CA209214 Final CSR). 15 (3.5%) of these subjects were 
intermediate/poor-risk subjects (Table S.6.6.1 of the CA209214 Final CSR). Of these AEs, 9 (1.6%) 
were grade 3-5, and 3 were grade 5 (0.5%). The most frequent late-emergent AEs in the nivolumab + 
ipilimumab group (in more than 1 patient) occurred in SOCs: infections and infestations (3 patients; 
disseminated tuberculosis, lung infection, staphylococcal sepsis), investigations (3 patients; ASAT 
increased, ALAT increased, bilirubin increased), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (3 
patients; arthritis, arthralgia, myalgia), gastrointestinal disorders (2 patients; colitis, lower 
gastrointestinal haemorrhage), general disorders and administration site conditions (2 patients; 
fatigue, sudden death),  immune system disorders (2 patients; contrast media allergy), skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders (2 patients; prurigo, rash). In the sunitinib group, 2 (0.4%) subjects 
reported late-emergent drug-related AEs, and 1 subject was intermediate/poor-risk (Table S.6.6 and 
Table S.6.6.1 of the CA209214 Final CSR1). The late-emergent AEs in the sunitinib group occurred in 
SOCs gastrointestinal disorders (diarrhoea) and investigations (ASAT increased, ALAT increased, and 
bilirubin increased).

Deaths 
As of the 07-Aug-2017 DBL, a lower proportion of treated subjects in the nivolumab + ipilimumab 
group (29.1%) had died compared with the sunitinib group (37.8%) (Table 41). Disease progression 
was the most common cause of death for both groups, including deaths occurring within 100 days of 
last dose. 23 (4.2%) and 25 (4.7%) subjects in each group died within 30 days of last dose, and the 
most common cause of deaths was due to ‘other’ in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group and disease 
progression in the sunitinib group. The causes of death in the ‘other’ class in the nivolumab + 
ipilimumab group are provided below.

Deaths related to study drug toxicity 
The following deaths were attributed to study drug toxicity by the investigator: 
- 
- 
7 (1.3%) deaths in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group: 3 subjects died within 100 days of last dose (1 
of these 3 subjects died within 30 days of last dose), and 4 subjects died beyond 100 days of last 
dose. 
4 (0.7%) deaths in the sunitinib group: 3 subjects died within 30 days of last dose, and 1 subject died 
33 days since the last dose. 
The applicant’s assessment for the cause of death for the 7 deaths in the nivolumab + ipilimumab 
group was “not related” in 4, “related” in 2, and “needs more information” in 1 case(s). Among the 4 
deaths attributed to sunitinib by the investigators, the applicant’s assessment concurred with 3 as 
“related”, and 1 death was considered “unrelated.” A listing of the suspected causes of death is 
provided below (for detailed information refer to Table S.6 of the CA209214 Final CSR).

In all treated subjects, the overall frequencies of all-causality SAEs and drug-related SAEs were 
numerically higher in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group than in the sunitinib group. Drug-related SAEs 
consisted mainly of events in the SOCs of GI and endocrine disorders and infections and infestations 
disorders in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group, and GI disorders and respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorders in the sunitinib group. SAEs were reported in 55.8% of subjects in the nivolumab 
+ ipilimumab group and 39.8% of subjects in the sunitinib group (Table 42). Grade 3-4 SAEs were 
reported in 41.5% and 30.1% of subjects in the nivolumab + ipilimumab and sunitinib groups, 
respectively.

Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation of Study Therapy 
In all treated subjects, the overall frequencies of all-causality and drug-related AEs leading to 
discontinuation numerically higher in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group compared to the sunitinib 
group. AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 30.7% of subjects in the nivolumab + 
ipilimumab group and 21.3% of subjects in the sunitinib group (Table 44). Grade 3-4 AEs leading to 
discontinuation were reported in 21.6% and 13.8% of the subjects in the nivolumab + ipilimumab and

≥1% of Subjects) by Worst CTC Grade - All Treated Subjects 
Selected Adverse Events 
In order to characterize AEs of special clinical interest that are potentially associated with the use of 
nivolumab, the applicant identified select AEs based on the following 4 guiding principles: 
-  AEs that may differ in type, frequency, or severity from AEs caused by non-immunotherapies. 
-  AEs that may require immunosuppression (e.g., corticosteroids) as part of their management. 
-  AEs whose early recognition and management may mitigate severe toxicity. 
-  AEs for which multiple event terms may be used to describe a single type of AE, thereby necessitating 
Assessment report  
EMA/902855/2019  
Page 110/176 
 
 
 
 
 
the pooling of terms for full characterization. 
Based on these guiding principles and taking into account the types of AEs already observed across 
studies of nivolumab monotherapy, endocrinopathies, diarrhoea/colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, 
interstitial nephritis, and rash are currently considered to be select AEs. Multiple event terms that may 
describe each of these were grouped into endocrine, gastrointestinal (GI), hepatic, pulmonary, renal, 
and skin select AE categories, respectively. Hypersensitivity/infusion reactions were analysed along 
with the select AE categories because multiple event terms may be used to describe such events and 
pooling of terms was therefore necessary for full characterization. Hypersensitivity/infusion reactions 
do not otherwise meet criteria to be considered select AEs. 
Endocrine Events 
The endocrine select AE category included the following subcategories: adrenal disorders, diabetes, 
pituitary disorders and thyroid disorders. Endocrine select AEs (all-causality, any grade) were reported 
in 195 (35.6%) subjects in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group and 175 (32.7%) subjects in the 
sunitinib group. In the nivolumab + ipilimumab group, 178 (32.5%) subjects had endocrine select AEs 
considered to be drug-related by the investigator, vs. 30.5% in the sunitinib group (Table 47). The 
most commonly reported drug-related event was hypothyroidism (15.5% of subjects). Most of the 
drug-related endocrine events were Grade 1-2, but 38 (6.9%) subjects had Grade 3-4 drug-related 
events in the ipilimumab + nivolumab group vs. 0.2% in the sunitinib group. 16 (2.9%) subjects had 
drug-related endocrine select AEs that led to permanent discontinuation of nivolumab + ipilimumab, 
versus 0% in the sunitinib group. 
The median time to onset of drug-related endocrine AEs was 8.43 weeks (Table 2.5.1-2).  
In total 68 subjects (12.4%) were treated with immune-modulating medication for a median duration 
of 16.36 weeks. 45 subjects received high dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 2.14 weeks. 
21 subjects treated with immune-modulating medication had resolution of their events. Overall, 76 of 
the 178 subjects with drug-related endocrine select AEs resolved; the median time to resolution was 
not available at the time of DBL.

(4.0%) subjects had drug-related GI select AEs that led to permanent discontinuation of nivolumab + 
ipilimumab, versus 4 patients (0.7%) in the sunitinib group. The median time to onset of drug-related 
GI select AEs was 5.36 weeks. 47 subjects (8.6%) were treated with immune-modulating medication 
for a median duration of 7.86 weeks. 40 subjects were treated with high dose corticosteroids for a 
median duration of 3.14 weeks. 44 subjects treated with immune-modulating medication had

ipilimumab group and 73 (13.6%) subjects in the sunitinib group. In the nivolumab + ipilimumab 
group, 48 (8.8%) subjects had renal select AEs considered to be drug-related by the investigator, 
versus 8.6% in the sunitinib group (Table 50).  
Table 50 Summary of Drug-related Renal Select Adverse Events Reported Up to  
30 days after Last Dose - All Treated Subjects 
In total 7 (1.3%) subjects had Grade 3-4 drug-related events in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group 
versus 1.1% in the sunitinib group. 7 (1.3%) subjects had drug-related renal select AEs that led to 
permanent discontinuation of nivolumab + ipilimumab. 2 of the 7 subjects who discontinued nivolumab 
+ ipilimumab treatment had Grade 4 events: 1 increased blood creatinine and 1 acute kidney injury. 
The median time to onset of drug-related renal events was 8.93 weeks. 19 subjects were treated with 
immune-modulating medication for a median duration of 5.29 weeks. 13 subjects received high dose 
corticosteroids for a median duration of 2.14 weeks. 13 subjects treated with immune-modulating 
medication had resolution of their events. Overall, 37 of the 48 subjects with drug-related renal select 
AEs had resolution of their events; the median time to resolution was 13.21 weeks. 
Skin Events 
Skin select AEs (all-causality, any grade) were reported in 305 (55.8%) subjects in the nivolumab +

In the nivolumab + ipilimumab group, 267 (48.8%) subjects had skin select AEs considered to be 
drug-related by the investigator, versus 56.8% in the sunitinib group. The most frequently reported 
drug-related events were pruritus and rash. There was no event of toxic epidermal necrolysis reported; 
however, 1 subject had a SAE of Stevens-Johnson syndrome in the ipilimumab + nivolumab group 
(grade 3-4). 20 (3.7%) subjects had Grade 3-4 events in the ipilimumab + nivolumab group, versus 
9.9% in the sunitinib group. 8 (1.5%) subjects had drug-related skin select AEs that led to permanent 
discontinuation of nivolumab + ipilimumab, versus 4 patients (0.7%) in the sunitinib group. The 
median time to onset of drug-related skin select AEs was 4.00 weeks. 100 subjects were treated with 
immune-modulating medication for a median duration of 13.50 weeks (19 received a corticosteroid at 
a dose ≥ 40 mg for a median duration of 2.29 weeks). In total 51 subjects (9.3%) treated with 
immune-modulating medication had resolution of their events. Overall, 192 of 267 subjects with skin 
select AEs had resolution of their events with a median time to resolution of 11.57 weeks. 
Hypersensitivity/infusion Reactions 
Hypersensitivity/infusion reactions (all-causality, any grade) were reported in 29 (5.3%) subjects in 
the nivolumab + ipilimumab group and 12 (2.2%) subjects in the sunitinib group.  
In the nivolumab + ipilimumab group, 22 (4.0%) subjects had hypersensitivity/infusion reactions 
select AEs considered to be drug-related by the investigator, versus 1.1% in the sunitinib group. None 
of the events led to permanent discontinuation of nivolumab + ipilimumab. The median time to onset 
of drug-related hypersensitivity/infusion reactions select AEs was 3.14 weeks. 6 subjects were treated 
with immune-modulating medication for a median duration of 0.14 weeks. 2 subjects received high 
dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 0.14 weeks. 5 subjects treated with immune-modulating 
medication had resolution of their events. Overall, 20 of the 22 subjects with hypersensitivity/infusion 
reactions select AEs had resolution of their events with a median time to resolution of 0.14 weeks.  
Other Events of Special Interest 
Other events of special interest (OESIs) were events that do not fulfil all criteria to qualify as select 
AEs. These events may differ from those caused by non-immunotherapies and may require 
immunosuppression as part of their management. Analyses of OESIs had extended follow-up (100-day 
window). OESIs included the following categories: myasthenic syndrome, demyelination, Guillain-Barré 
syndrome, pancreatitis, uveitis, encephalitis, myocarditis, myositis, and rhabdomyolysis. OESI included 
the following categories: myasthenic syndrome, demyelination, Guillain-Barré syndrome, pancreatitis, 
uveitis, encephalitis, myocarditis, myositis and rhabdomyolysis. A summary of OESI is presented below 
in Table 51.  
It can be seen that grade≥3 OESIs were more frequent in the ipilimumab + nivolumab arm (11 
patients, 2.0%) than in the sunitinib arm (4 patients, 0.7%).  All but 3 OESIs in the ipilimumab + 
nivolumab arm resolved, within 1-62 days. In the sunitinib arm, all OESIs resolved.

Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
- In the nivolumab + ipilimumab group, absolute lymphocytes (5.2%) were the only Grade 3-4 
haematologic abnormality reported in ≥ 5% of subjects. 
 - In the sunitinib group, the Grade 3-4 haematologic abnormalities reported in ≥ 5% of subjects were 
decreased absolute neutrophil count (19.3% Grade 3, 1.0% Grade 4), decreased absolute lymphocytes 
(13.2% Grade 3, 1.3% Grade 4), decreased platelet count (12.2% Grade 3, 1.5% Grade 4), and 
decreased haemoglobin (9.0% Grade 3). 
Liver function tests 
Abnormalities in liver function tests are described in Table 52. 
Table 52 Summary of liver function test abnormalities - All Treated Subjects 
Kidney function tests 
In the nivolumab + ipilimumab and sunitinib groups, the majority of subjects with at least 1 on-
treatment measurement had normal creatinine values during the treatment reporting period. In both 
groups, the majority of reported abnormalities in creatinine (increases) were Grade 1 or 2. 9 (1.7%) 
subjects in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group and 7 (1.3%) subjects in the sunitinib group had a 
Grade 3 abnormality in creatinine; two Grade 4 abnormalities and one Grade 4 abnormality were 
reported in the nivolumab + ipilimumab and sunitinib groups, respectively.

Safety in special populations 
In CA209214, the frequency of total AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation and AEs by MedDRA High-level 
Group Term (HLGT)/SMQs/SOC by age group are presented in Table 54. The frequencies of SAEs 
including fatal events appeared to increase with increasing age. 
Table 54 Summary of Safety Results by Age Group - All Subjects Treated with 
Ipilimumab + Nivolumab 
Immunogenicity 
The immunogenicity of nivolumab and ipilimumab was assessed when administered in combination in 
Study CA209214. The incidence of nivolumab anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) was 26.0% (107/411 
subjects) when nivolumab 3 mg/kg was administered in combination with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg. 2 
subjects (0.5%) were neutralizing ADA (NAb) positive and 9 subjects (2.2%) were considered 
persistent positive. The incidence of ipilimumab ADA was 6.3% (26/415 subjects) and no subject was 
NAb positive (to ipilimumab) or considered persistent positive.  
The presence of nivolumab or ipilimumab ADA was not associated with the occurrence of 
hypersensitivity and/or infusion-related reactions. In the analysis of hypersensitivity/infusion reaction 
AEs by ADA status (positive, negative) in all treated subjects who were ADA positive or negative, 
nivolumab and ipilimumab ADA occurrence did not appear to impact safety. Out of all subjects who 
received nivolumab + ipilimumab combination therapy who were evaluable for ADA, 5/107 (4.7%) 
nivolumab ADA positive subjects experienced AEs in the hypersensitivity/infusion reaction category. In 
comparison, 14/304 (4.6%) nivolumab ADA negative subjects experienced AEs in the 
hypersensitivity/infusion reaction category. No ipilimumab ADA positive subjects experienced 
hypersensitivity/infusion reaction AEs, whereas 19 (4.9%) ipilimumab ADA negative subjects 
experienced AEs in the hypersensitivity/infusion reaction category.

Safety in Intermediate/Poor-risk patients 
The safety profile of nivolumab + ipilimumab combination therapy when compared to sunitinib 
monotherapy in intermediate/poor-risk subjects was consistent with that reported above for the all 
treated population, and no notable differences between the frequency of all-causality and drug-related 
SAEs or AEs were observed between the all treated population and the intermediate/poor-risk subjects 
(Table 55).

Safety data to Support the Adverse Reactions in the Nivolumab and Ipilimumab Summary of 
Product Characteristics and Package Leaflets and PIs 
To support an update of the Undesirable Effects section of the Summary of Product Characteristics 
(SmPC), safety data were further integrated across studies in multiple indications. Safety results for 
CA209214 nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg combination safety data were presented side by 
side with the integrated safety from previous nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipilimumab 3 mg/kg combination 
studies (thus excluding CA209214). The 3 studies (melanoma) included in the analyses for nivolumab 
1 mg/kg + ipilimumab 3 mg/kg combination were CA209067 (nivolumab + ipilimumab combination 
arm), CA209069, and CA209004 (Cohort 8 only). 
The presentation of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in Section 4.8 of the approved OPDIVO (nivolumab) 
SmPC currently displays two columns in Table 2, one for nivolumab monotherapy and one for 
nivolumab 1 mg/kg in combination with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg. The nivolumab 1 mg/kg in combination 
with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg pooled data set includes 3 studies in melanoma; CA209067 (nivolumab + 
ipilimumab combination arm), CA209069, and CA209004 (Cohort 8 only). In the now proposed SmPC, 
the ADR table has been split into two, Table 2 for nivolumab monotherapy and Table 3 with two 
different columns: one for nivolumab 1 mg/kg in combination with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg and one for 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg in combination with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg. An additional table, Table 4, has been 
added to Section 4.8 of the nivolumab SmPC to reflect the immune-related ADRs leading to permanent 
discontinuation or requiring high-dose corticosteroids for nivolumab monotherapy, nivolumab 3 mg/kg 
in combination with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg, and nivolumab 1 mg/kg in combination with ipilimumab 3 
mg/kg. 
For nivolumab monotherapy, the proposed SmPC reflects the data for the current pooled nivolumab 
monotherapy population across other tumour types (n = 2950), as described in the gastric cancer 
(GC)/gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer procedure (EMEA/H/C/003985/II/039, ongoing review). 
The table of adverse reactions included in the updated SmPC provided as part of this application (Table 
2 of Section 4.8) is identical to the table submitted for GC/GEJ cancer (Procedure 
EMEA/H/C/003985/II/039, ongoing review). For ipilimumab monotherapy, the proposed SmPC reflects 
the currently approved data for the current pooled ipilimumab monotherapy population (n = 767).

Two additional tables have been added to Section 4.8 of the YERVOY (ipilimumab) SmPC: Table 3, to 
reflect the ADRs for ipilimumab 1 mg/kg in combination with nivolumab 3 mg/kg; and Table 4, to 
reflect the immune-related ADRs leading to permanent discontinuation or requiring high-dose 
corticosteroids for ipilimumab 1 mg/kg in combination with nivolumab 3 mg/kg. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of the combination of nivolumab 3 mg/kg with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg is assessed 
primarily based on the data of the ‘all treated subjects’ safety population, including favourable, 
intermediate and poor-risk patients, in order to maximise the size of the safety database. Safety data 
for the primary efficacy population (intermediate/poor-risk subjects, i.e. the target population) were 
highly similar to the safety data of the all treated population (Table 55).  
The combination regimen of nivolumab + ipilimumab used in the current pivotal study is nivolumab 3 
mg/kg + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg, which is different from the regimen approved for melanoma, i.e. 
nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipilimumab 3 mg/kg. The observed safety profile in the current study is similar 
to that observed in the pooled melanoma studies, where nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipilimumab 3 mg/kg 
was used, although the frequencies of some AEs which are known to be ipilimumab dose-dependent 
(e.g. gastrointestinal toxicities) appear somewhat lower with 1 mg/kg than with 3 mg/kg ipilimumab.  
The most frequently reported AEs in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group (AEs regardless of causality 
and grade) were fatigue, diarrhoea, pruritus and nausea. In the sunitinib group, the most frequently 
reported AEs were diarrhoea, fatigue, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, hypertension, 
nausea and dysgeusia. Grade 3-4 AEs regardless of causality were reported in 65.3% of subjects in the 
nivolumab + ipilimumab group and 76.1% of subjects in the sunitinib group. The most frequently 
reported drug-related AEs in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group were fatigue (36.9%), pruritus 
(28.2%), diarrhoea (26.5%) and rash (21.6%). In the sunitinib group, the most frequently reported 
drug-related AEs were diarrhoea (52.0%), fatigue (49.3%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia 
syndrome (43.2%), hypertension (40.4%), nausea (37.8%) and dysgeusia (33.5%). Grade 3-4 drug-
related AEs were reported in 45.7% of subjects in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group and 62.6% of 
subjects in the sunitinib group (Table 40). In the nivolumab + ipilimumab group, the most frequently 
reported Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs were lipase increased (10.2%), amylase increased (5.7%), 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased (4.9%), fatigue (4.2%) and diarrhoea (3.8%). In the 
sunitinib group, the most frequently reported Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs reported were hypertension 
(15.9%), fatigue (9.2%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (9.2%), platelet count 
decreased (6.7%), lipase increased (6.5%), neutropenia (6.0%) and diarrhoea (5.2%). 
The safety profile of nivolumab + ipilimumab is characterised by a high frequency of immune-related 
adverse events, i.e. AEs observed during treatment with ipilimumab and/or nivolumab that are 
believed to have an immune-related aetiology consistent with the mechanism of action of these drugs. 
The most frequently reported any-grade drug-related immune-related AE categories were skin 
(48.8%), endocrine (32.5%) and gastrointestinal (28.2%). Most endocrine, GI, hepatic, pulmonary, 
skin and hypersensitivity/infusion reaction select AEs were considered drug-related by the investigator. 
A proportion of the immune-related AEs seen with nivolumab + ipilimumab did not resolve, e.g., 102 
of the 178 subjects with drug-related endocrine immune-related AEs did not have their AE resolved.  
Thus, the safety profile of nivolumab + ipilimumab and the safety profile of sunitinib are very different. 
Sunitinib treatment is typically associated with low-grade diarrhoea as well as with hypertension, 
hand-foot syndrome, fatigue, nausea and dysgeusia, while the most notable AEs associated with 
treatment with nivolumab plus ipilimumab are the immune-related AEs which sometimes require (long-
term) treatment with corticosteroids. This means that the comparison of risks is not straightforward. 
Even so, it appears that overall the combination treatment is less well tolerated than sunitinib. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/902855/2019  
Page 121/176 
 
 
 
combination treatment was associated with a higher frequency of SAEs (55.8% vs. 39.8%), although 
the overall frequency of AEs regardless of causality was comparable between study arms. The poorer 
tolerability of the combination treatment is further illustrated by the relatively high frequency of 
treatment discontinuation. Drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 21.6% of 
patients in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group and in 11.8% of patients in the sunitinib group, and 
grade 3-4 drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 15.4% and 6.9% of the 
subjects, respectively. 
The safety profiles for sunitinib and nivolumab + ipilimumab in the current pivotal study are consistent 
with existing data on the safety profile of both treatments (EPARs Sutent, Opdivo). When taking into 
account the available safety data in melanoma patients, no new safety concerns were identified with 
the combination of nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg in metastatic renal cell carcinoma. The 
frequencies of AEs related to important identified risks for nivolumab and ipilimumab, e.g. immune-
related adverse reactions, are in line with existing data on the safety profile of the combination.  
Death as a result of study drug toxicity (as declared by the investigator) occurred in 7 patients (1.3%) 
in the nivolumab + ipilimumab arm versus 4 patients (0.7%) in the sunitinib arm. Thus, both arms 
were associated with a low rate of fatal drug toxicity, although numerically the risk with combination 
therapy appears higher. However, there was also an imbalance in deaths attributed to “other reasons” 
between study arms, i.e. 22 deaths in the ipilimumab + nivolumab arm, versus 13 deaths in the 
sunitinib arm. This imbalance was driven primairily by a higher frequency of infection-related deaths 
and cardiovascular event-related deaths in the ipilimumab + nivolumab group. Therefore, it is 
considered that it cannot be excluded that these deaths were to some extent related to treatment with 
ipilimumab + nivolumab.   
The impact of late-emergent drug-related AEs was not sufficiently addressed by the applicant. Late-
emergent drug-related AEs were defined as drug-related AEs with an onset date >100 days after the 
last dose of study therapy. In the sunitinib group, 2 (0.4%) subjects reported late-emergent drug-
related AEs, and 1 subject was intermediate/poor-risk. In the nivolumab + ipilimumab group, 20 
(3.7%) subjects had late-emergent drug-related AEs. 15 (3.5%) of these subjects were 
intermediate/poor-risk subjects. Of these AEs, 9 (1.6%) were grade 3-5, and 3 were grade 5 (0.5%). 
The most frequent late-emergent AEs in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group (in more than 1 patient) 
occurred in SOCs: infections and infestations (3 patients; disseminated tuberculosis, lung infection, 
staphylococcal sepsis), investigations (3 patients; ASAT increased, ALAT increased, bilirubin 
increased), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (3 patients; arthritis, arthralgia, myalgia), 
gastrointestinal disorders (2 patients; colitis, lower gastrointestinal haemorrhage), general disorders 
and administration site conditions (2 patients; fatigue, sudden death),  immune system disorders (2 
patients; contrast media allergy), skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (2 patients; prurigo, rash).  
The frequencies of SAEs, including fatal SAEs, appeared to increase strongly with increasing age. For 
example, in patients <65 years of age SAEs occurred with a frequency of 52.4%, while in patients 75-
84 years of age the frequency was 65.1%. Similarly, fatal AEs occurred in 2.4% of patients <65 years 
of age, versus 16.3% of patients 75-84 years of age. The applicant was asked to discuss the 
benefit/risk balance of the combination treatment in elderly patients. It was concluded that safety was 
somewhat poorer in elderly in both study arms. 
The immunogenicity profile of nivolumab + ipilimumab was similar to the profile seen in melanoma, 
and did not appear to affect safety.  
When compared to nivolumab monotherapy in the second-line treatment of RCC, the combination of 
ipilimumab + nivolumab in first line appears to have much poorer safety, e.g., grade 3-4 drug-related 
AEs were reported in 45.7% of subjects in the nivolumab + ipilimumab arm in the current study, while 
nivolumab monotherapy in second line was associated with 18.7% grade 3-4 drug-related AEs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/902855/2019  
Page 122/176 
 
 
 
Although this is a cross-study comparison, these findings indicate that ipilimumab contributes 
substantially to toxicity in the combination. This is consistent with comparative data between 
nivolumab monotherapy and the combination therapy in melanoma (grade 3-4 drug-related AEs 
reported less frequently in the pooled monotherapy group in melanoma [13.7%] than in the pooled 
combination therapy group [54.1%]; EMA/CHMP/215704/2016).  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The combination nivolumab + ipilimumab has a safety profile which is very different from that of 
sunitinib. The combination appears to be less well tolerated than sunitinib. The safety profiles of 
nivolumab + ipilimumab and sunitinib in the current pivotal study were consistent with existing data on 
the safety profile of each treatment. When considering the available safety data on ipilimumab + 
nivolumab in melanoma patients, no new safety concerns were identified with the combination of 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg in advanced RCC, and the frequencies of AEs related to 
important identified risks for nivolumab and ipilimumab, e.g. immune-related adverse reactions, are in 
line with existing data on combination therapy.  
The safety profile of ipilimumab + nivolumab in the current dossier seems to compare unfavourably 
with nivolumab monotherapy in second-line renal cell carcinoma, as well as with nivolumab 
monotherapy in other tumour types. It is clear that addition of ipilimumab contributes substantially to 
toxicity, consistent with data in melanoma. In view of the substantial additional toxicity, the 
contribution to benefit of ipilimumab in the first-line treatment of RCC remains unclear (refer to clinical 
efficacy). 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP having considered the data submitted in the application was of the opinion that due to the 
concerns identified with this application, the risk management plan for Opdivo and Yervoy cannot be 
agreed at this stage. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the Opdivo and 
Yervoy SmPCs have been proposed to be updated. In addition, the Worksharing applicant (WSA) would 
take the opportunity to correct some typos throughout the Yervoy and Opdivo product information. 
In light of the negative recommendation, the proposed changes to the SmPC and Package Leaflet for 
Opdivo and Yervoy cannot be agreed at this stage. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the WSA and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
•  The readability of the PL (QRD template Version 9.0) of OPDIVO (nivolumab) and Yervoy 
(ipilimumab), in English, was assessed during the assessment of the initial Marketing Authorisation 
Application (MAA) according to the methods outlined in the European Commission’s guideline   
•  The new indication that is hereby applied for concerns the same route of administration and has a 
similar safety profile as the previously approved indications. 
Assessment report  
EMA/902855/2019  
Page 123/176 
 
 
 
•  Administration of is done by a health care professional. The instructions for dose calculation, 
preparation, administration, storage and disposal that are currently reflected in the approved PL 
remain unchanged. 
•  The general design and layout of the proposed PL have not changed compared to the tested one. 
However, in light of the negative recommendation, the proposed changes to the Package Leaflet for 
Opdivo and Yervoy cannot be agreed at this stage. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The new claimed indication for nivolumab + ipilimumab is for the treatment of adult patients with 
intermediate/poor-risk advanced renal cell carcinoma (first-line treatment). 
3.1.2.   Available therapies and unmet medical need 
According to ESMO guidelines and NCCN guidelines, sunitinib, bevacizumab plus interferon, and 
pazopanib are all standard treatment options for favourable and intermediate-risk patients in the first-
line treatment of RCC. Currently, the median OS of patients with advanced RCC is estimated to be 
around 8 months for poor-risk patients, 23 months for intermediate-risk patients and 43 months for 
favourable-risk patients, indicating the need for improved treatments. The standard treatment option 
in previously untreated RCC patients is sunitinib for favourable/intermediate-risk patients. For poor-
risk patients, the standard treatment option can either be sunitinib or temsirolimus. The median OS is 
less than 4 years for treatment-naive patients with the most favourable prognosis, and less than 1 
year in patients with poor prognosis, indicating the need for more efficacious therapies. Nivolumab is 
currently indicated for second-line treatment of RCC, while ipilimumab currently has no approved 
indication in RCC. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main study was CA209214, a phase 3, randomised, open-label study of nivolumab 3 mg/kg 
combined with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses followed by nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 
weeks, vs. sunitinib monotherapy using the approved dose and schedule (50 mg orally once daily for 4 
weeks followed by 2 weeks off, every cycle) in adults (≥ 18 years) with previously untreated advanced 
RCC. All randomised subjects included previously untreated favourable, intermediate and poor-risk 
advanced RCC patients (according to Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium criteria). 
The primary objective of the study was to determine OS, PFS and ORR in the subset of 
intermediate/poor-risk patients, as analysis of this subset of patients in the primary analysis would 
allow for potential meaningful differences in efficacy to be detected earlier than if favourable-risk 
patients were also included in the primary efficacy analysis.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
Only favourable effects in the primary efficacy population, i.e. intermediate/poor-risk patients, which 
comprise the target population, are discussed here. 
A statistically significant difference in OS was observed in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group compared 
to the sunitinib group in intermediate/poor-risk subjects (HR: 0.63 [99.8% CI: 0.44, 0.89]; stratified 
log-rank 2-sided p-value < 0.0001). The median OS was not reached for the nivolumab + ipilimumab 
group and 25.95 months for the sunitinib group. The OS rates were 89.5% and 86.2% at 6 months, 
and 80.1% and 72.1% at 12 months in the nivolumab + ipilimumab and the sunitinib groups, 
respectively. K-M curves separated after approximately 3 months, favouring nivolumab + ipilimumab. 
Updated OS data confirmed previous data (HR: 0.66 [95% CI: 0.54, 0.81]; p-value < 0.0001).  
A numerical difference in PFS was found favouring the nivolumab + ipilimumab group (HR = 0.82, 
[99.1% CI: 0.64,1.05], p-value: 0.0331). Median PFS was 11.56 months (95% CI: 8.71, 15.51) and 
8.38 months in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group and the sunitinib group, respectively. The 12-month 
PFS rate was 49.6% in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group and 42.6% in the sunitinib group. At 
approximately 6-7 months, the K-M curves separated, favouring nivolumab + ipilimumab.  
The independent radiology review committee (IRRC)-assessed ORR was higher in the nivolumab + 
ipilimumab group (41.6% [95% CI: 36.9, 46.5]) than in the sunitinib group (26.5% [95% CI: 22.4, 
31.0]). The stratified difference in ORR (nivolumab + ipilimumab - sunitinib) was 16.0% (95% CI: 9.8, 
22.2), p-value < 0.0001. BOR was CR in 9.4% and 1.2 % of subjects, BOR was PR in 32.2% and 
25.4% of subjects and BOR was SD in 31.3% and 44.5% of subjects in the nivolumab + ipilimumab 
group and in the sunitinib group, respectively. TTR was 2.79 months in the nivolumab + ipilimumab 
group and 3.04 months in the sunitinib group. DOR was not reached at the time of database lock in the 
nivolumab + ipilimumab group and was 18.17 months in the sunitinib group.      
Subgroup analyses showed that the unstratified HR for OS for nivolumab + ipilimumab vs. sunitinib 
was 0.53 (95% CI: 0.40, 0.71) for patients aged <65 years, as compared to HR 0.86 (95% CI: 0.40, 
0.71) and 0.97 (95% CI: 0.40, 0.71) for patients aged ≥65 years and patients aged <75–≥75, 
respectively.  
Subgroup analyses showed that the unstratified HR for OS for nivolumab + ipilimumab vs. sunitinib 
was 0.55 (95% CI: 0.41, 0.73) for patients with Karnofsky performance status (KPS) 90-100 
compared to HR 0.86 (95% CI: 0.61, 1.20) for patients with KPS <90.  
Subgroup analyses showed that the unstratified HR for OS for nivolumab + ipilimumab vs. sunitinib 
was 0.45 (95% CI: 0.29, 0.71) for patients with baseline PD-L1-positive status (≥1%) versus HR 0.73 
(95% CI: 0.56, 0.96) for patients with baseline PD-L1-negative status (<1%).  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
•  The most critical uncertainty in this application remains the contribution of ipilimumab to the 
efficacy of the combination therapy nivolumab + ipilimumab. Nivolumab has previously been shown to 
be active in the target population, and is approved for the treatment of advanced RCC after prior 
therapy in adults. In contrast, the benefits of ipilimumab treatment in the target population are 
insufficiently characterised. In the pivotal study, the applicant did not compare efficacy of the 
combination therapy with either nivolumab monotherapy or ipilimumab monotherapy. Also in phase 
I/II studies, the effect of the combination therapy was not investigated in comparison with either 
nivolumab or ipilimumab monotherapy, although a direct comparison was made between 1 mg/kg 
ipilimumab + 3 mg/kg nivolumab and 3 mg/kg ipilimumab + 1 mg/kg nivolumab. The performed 
Assessment report  
EMA/902855/2019  
Page 125/176 
 
 
 
exposure-effect analysis aimed at establishing the contribution of ipilimumab is considered 
inconclusive, due to insufficient data included in the model to determine the effects of nivolumab and 
ipilimumab in first and second-line treatment of RCC. The lack of demonstration of the contribution of 
ipilimumab to efficacy of the combination treatment is considered an important issue, especially 
because it is evident that addition of ipilimumab leads to substantial additional toxicity. Moreover, the 
benefit/risk balance of ipilimumab monotherapy in advanced RCC (MDX010-11 study) was not 
considered sufficiently favourable by the applicant to warrant further development.  
•  There is also still uncertainty regarding the dose of ipilimumab. It is not clear whether 1 mg/kg 
ipilimumab is an effective dose contributing to clinical benefit in RCC (nor in other cancers). Dosing 
schedules containing only 1 mg/kg ipilimumab appear not to have been tested in RCC patients (only a 
study in which patients received first a 3 mg/kg loading dose followed by doses of 1 mg/kg; in which 
1/21 patients had a partial response). As a result, the dose-response relationship of ipilimumab in RCC 
is poorly characterised, and it cannot be concluded that 1 mg/kg ipilimumab contributes to a relevant 
extent to efficacy of the combination treatment. 
•  Potentially reduced OS benefit of the combination therapy was observed in patients >65 years, 
although efficacy still appears comparable to that of sunitinib.  
•  Tumour PD-L1 expression (<1% vs. ≥1%) had an effect on OS (HR: 0.73 [95% CI: 0.56, 0.96] vs. 
HR: 0.45 [95% CI: 0.29, 0.71]), PFS (HR: 1.06 [95% CI: 0.87, 1.36] vs. HR: 0.45 [95% CI: 0.29, 
0.71]) and ORR (36.8% vs. 47.1%). However, the methods used to score PD-L1 expression in tumour 
tissue were suboptimal (e.g. immune cell expression was not taken into account). Updated PD-L1 
analyses are required to determine the role of PD-L1 expression in the efficacy of the combination 
therapy. 
•  Additional biomarkers for efficacy of nivolumab + ipilimumab are available which may have an 
impact on the benefit/risk of the combination treatment in subgroups of patients. These biomarkers 
include tumour mutational burden, tumour infiltrating lymphocytes, gene expression profiling, and 
single nucleotide polymorphism in immune-related genes. These biomarker analyses were not included 
in the CSR while these were planned to be analysed by the applicant. The applicant should provide 
these additional biomarker analyses as a post-authorisation measure if the application is approved. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The most frequently reported drug-related AEs in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group were fatigue 
(36.9%), pruritus (28.2%), diarrhoea (26.5%), and rash (21.6%). In the sunitinib group, the most 
frequently reported drug-related AEs were diarrhoea (52.0%), fatigue (49.3%), palmar-plantar 
erythrodysesthesia syndrome (43.2%), hypertension (40.4%), nausea (37.8%), and dysgeusia 
(33.5%).  
Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs were reported in 45.7% of subjects in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group 
and 62.6% of subjects in the sunitinib group. In the nivolumab + ipilimumab group, the most 
frequently reported Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs were lipase increased (10.2%), amylase increased 
(5.7%), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased (4.9%), fatigue (4.2%), and diarrhoea (3.8%). In 
the sunitinib group, the most frequently reported Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs reported were 
hypertension (15.9%), fatigue (9.2%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (9.2%), platelet 
count decreased (6.7%), lipase increased (6.5%), neutropaenia (6.0%), and diarrhoea (5.2%). 
SAEs were reported in 55.8% of subjects in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group and 39.8% of subjects 
in the sunitinib group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/902855/2019  
Page 126/176 
 
 
 
In patients <65 years of age SEAs occurred with a frequency of 52.4%, while in patients 75-84 years 
of age the frequency was 65.1%. Fatal AEs occurred in 2.4% of patients <65 years of age, versus 
16.3% of patients 75-84 years of age. 
The most frequently reported any-grade drug-related select AE categories in the ipilimumab + 
nivolumab group were skin (48.8%), endocrine (32.5%), and gastrointestinal (28.2%); versus 56.8%, 
30.5%, and 52.0%, respectively, in the sunitinib group. 
In the sunitinib group, 2 (0.4%) subjects reported late-emergent drug-related AEs, and 1 subject was 
intermediate/poor-risk. In the nivolumab + ipilimumab group, 20 (3.7%) subjects had late-emergent 
drug-related AEs. 15 (3.5%) of these subjects were intermediate/poor-risk subjects.  
Death as a result of study drug toxicity (as declared by the investigator) occurred in 7 patients (1.3%) 
in the nivolumab + ipilimumab arm versus 4 patients (0.7%) in the sunitinib arm. Deaths attributed to 
“other reasons” occurred in 22 patients in the ipilimumab + nivolumab arm, versus 13 patients in the 
sunitinib arm. This imbalance was driven primairily by a higher frequency of infection-related deaths 
and cardiovascular event-related deaths in the ipilimumab + nivolumab group. 
Drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 21.6% of subjects in the nivolumab + 
ipilimumab group and 11.8% of subjects in the sunitinib group. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The pivotal study was an open-label study, potentially affecting safety reporting. 
Follow-up was relatively short in relation to establishing the long-term safety of the combination of 
ipilimumab + nivolumab.

3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Importance of favourable effects 
In the current pivotal study, nivolumab + ipilimumab showed improved efficacy compared to sunitinib 
in previously untreated intermediate/poor-risk advanced RCC patients. The K-M curves split after 
approximately 3 months favouring nivolumab + ipilimumab. The observed OS benefit is considered 
clinically relevant. A difference of more than three months was found for the median PFS of 
nivolumab+ipilimumab compared to sunitinib. The K-M curves overlapped the first 6-7 months, then 
separated and favoured nivolumab + ipilimumab. These PFS results further support the observed OS 
benefit. Also, a convincing difference in ORR was observed favouring nivolumab + ipilimumab.

The lack of demonstration of the contribution of ipilimumab to efficacy of the combination therapy is 
considered a major issue. While the efficacy of nivolumab in RCC is evident, the (added) benefit from 
ipilimumab in RCC has not been adequately demonstrated. According to the ‘guideline on the 
evaluation of anticancer medicinal products in man’, a new combination of anticancer drugs should be 
compared to the combination partners as single agents at efficacious doses 
(EMA/CHMP/205/95/Rev.4). In the pivotal study (CA209214) both monotherapy arms are lacking, and 
the benefit of the combination therapy over monotherapy has also not been demonstrated in phase 
I/II. Upon request for supplementary information, the applicant further explored the earlier presented 
E-R model, comparing ORR and OS data between 1L and 2L+ RCC patients treated with either 
nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab or ipilimumab alone, and further submitted real world data 
for nivolumab monotherapy (off-label) and compared ORR data of nivolumab between 1L and 2L 
patients across tumour types. The E-R model is considered inconclusive, due to insufficient data 
included in the model to determine the effects of nivolumab and ipilimumab in first and second-line 
treatment of RCC. The results of the cross-study comparisons to compare ORR between nivolumab 
alone and nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab are difficult to interpret for several reasons, i.e. 
due to small sample size, uncertainty on the comparability of the patient populations among the 
studies, the assumption that the response in the 2nd line is comparable to 1st line, that a difference in 
ORR translates into OS benefit, as well as other limitations inherent to an indirect comparison of 
outcome data.   
Furthermore, there are questions regarding the dose of ipilimumab of 1 mg/kg. This dose is not used 
in any other indication (in melanoma 3 mg/kg is used in combination with nivolumab), nor is adequate 
data available to demonstrate that 1 mg/kg is an efficacious dose in RCC. The dose-response 
relationship of ipilimumab monotherapy in RCC patients has not been satisfactorily determined (while 
in melanoma the available dose-response data show a positive trend between dose and efficacy 
between 1-10 mg/kg and indicate that 1 mg/kg is on the low part of the dose-response curve). The 
applicant provided ALC data in melanoma and further explored study CA209016 in the second round. 
These data merely show that ipilimumab at 1 mg/kg increases ALC, but ALC is not a validated 
surrogate marker for clinical benefit and therefore these data do not contribute to the interpretation of 
the effect of ipilimumab on the benefits conferred by the combination therapy. 
What is evident is that addition of ipilimumab leads to a much worse safety profile compared to 
nivolumab monotherapy, stressing the importance of determining the added benefit of ipilimumab in 
combination with nivolumab in the target population of previously untreated advanced RCC patients 
with intermediate/poor-risk.  
It is considered that the uncertainty related to the unknown benefit of ipilimumab at a dose of 1 mg/kg 
in combination with nivolumab weighs heavily in the assessment of the benefit/risk balance of the 
combination treatment, since the undesirable consequence would be that many patients would be 
exposed to an anticancer agent with uncertain benefit and with clear additional risks. 
The effect of biomarkers cannot be adequately characterised based on the currently submitted data. 
The method of PD-L1 immunohistochemistry scoring was not complete, since PD-L1 expression on 
tumour-associated immune cells was not incorporated in the method of scoring. The applicant should 
provide additional PD-L1 biomarker data based on adequate scoring methodology. In addition, several 
other, potentially more relevant biomarkers for nivolumab + ipilimumab efficacy are available (as 
described in discussion on clinical efficacy). In the second round, the applicant has presented limited 
biomarker data and several planned biomarker analysis still need to be performed by the applicant. 
Remaining biomarker data should be provided by the applicant in the context of a post-authorisation 
measure.

Importance of unfavourable effects  
The combination of ipilimumab with nivolumab has a distinct safety profile, characterised by a high 
frequency of immune-mediated adverse events, and is in that respect very different from the safety 
profile of sunitinib. The combination treatment appears less well tolerated than sunitinib, and is 
associated with a higher frequency of SAEs, and drug-related treatment discontinuation. This should, 
however, be considered in the light of the observed OS benefit.  
The safety profile of nivolumab + ipilimumab in the current pivotal study is consistent with existing 
data on the safety profile of the combination in melanoma and the observed safety profile of sunitinib 
is also in line with available data, which is re-assuring and does not suggest bias in safety reporting as 
a result of the open-label design of the study. When taking into account the available safety data on 
ipilimumab + nivolumab in melanoma, no new safety concerns were identified with the combination of 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg in mRCC.  
As in melanoma, it is clear that the ipilimumab component of treatment contributes substantially to 
toxicity of the combination in RCC. Whether the additional toxicity is outweighed by the benefits, 
depends largely on whether a relevant contribution of (the proposed dose) of ipilimumab to efficacy 
can be demonstrated. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In the performed pivotal study, a clinically relevant OS benefit for nivolumab + ipilimumab versus 
sunitinib was observed in the first-line treatment of intermediate/poor-risk mRCC patients. However, 
there is great uncertainty about the contribution of ipilimumab to efficacy in the combination therapy, 
both due to lack of studies on single-agent contribution and uncertainties regarding the 1 mg/kg dose 
of ipilimumab, which is considered a major issue in assessing the benefit/risk. The response of the 
applicant upon request for supplementary information was not sufficient to demonstrate the 
contribution of ipilimumab to efficacy of the combination therapy. 
The safety profile of ipilimumab + nivolumab in the current dossier compares unfavourably to 
nivolumab monotherapy in second-line renal cell carcinoma, as well as with nivolumab monotherapy in 
other tumour types. It is clear that the addition of ipilimumab contributes substantially to toxicity, 
consistent with data in melanoma. 
In view of the substantial additional toxicity and since the contribution to benefit of ipilimumab in the 
first-line treatment of RCC remains unclear, the B/R of the combination is considered unsubstantiated.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
In the favourable-risk group of patients, no benefit for ipilimumab + nivolumab versus sunitinib was 
observed. In fact, sunitinib tended to perform better than the combination therapy in favourable-risk 
patients. It is currently not clear why there is such a strong difference between the intermediate/poor-
risk cohort and the favourable cohort in terms of the relative efficacy of ipilimumab + nivolumab 
versus sunitinib. 
Assessment report  
EMA/902855/2019  
Page 130/176 
 
 
 
A major deficiency in the current application is that the contribution of ipilimumab (in the studied dose) 
to the efficacy of the combination therapy has not been demonstrated. A full assessment of the 
efficacy associated with the combination and its components is thus prevented, whereas it is clear that 
addition of ipilimumab leads to a more unfavourable safety profile compared to nivolumab alone. 
Moreover, considering the lack of relevant efficacy of ipilimumab as monotherapy in first line treatment 
of RCC and the known efficacy of nivolumab monotherapy in second line treatment of RCC, 
investigating the efficacy of nivolumab monotherapy in first line advanced RCC is warranted. 
The combination of two or more drugs is often an adequate way to achieve or improve efficacy and/or 
improve safety compared to using single agents. This will often be the way forward to advance 
therapies in areas of unmet medical need. In this context, the establishment of adequate combinations 
and doses is crucial, as is outlined in the Guideline on the evaluation of anticancer medicinal products 
in man (EMA/CHMP/205/95 Rev.5). If information on these aspects is inadequate, there is a clear risk 
of exposing patients to combinations that have more toxicity compared to the individual components 
while not being more effective (and potentially even less so). Thus, because of the direct importance to 
public health, there is a requirement for a justification of the combination and the doses used. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The B/R for Opdivo in combination with Yervoy for treatment of previously untreated adult patients 
with intermediate/poor-risk advanced renal cell carcinoma is negative.

Grounds for refusal: 
Whereas: 
•  There is no basis to establish or to quantify any benefits conferred by 1 mg/kg ipilimumab as used 
in combination with 3 mg/kg nivolumab in the first-line treatment of intermediate/poor-risk advanced 
renal cell carcinoma patients, and specifically whether ipilimumab contributes to the efficacy of the 
combination therapy to an extent that outweighs the substantial additional toxicity. Therefore, the 
safety and efficacy of the combination cannot be considered properly or sufficiently demonstrated and 
a comprehensive assessment of the benefits and risks associated with the combination and its 
components cannot be completed in this case. The benefit-risk balance of the combination treatment 
with nivolumab and ipilimumab in this setting must thus currently be regarded as unsubstantiated. 
Divergent position to the majority recommendation is appended to this report. 
5.  Re-examination of the CHMP opinion of 26 July 2018 
Following the CHMP conclusion that nivolumab + ipilimumab for the treatment of adult patients with 
intermediate/poor-risk advanced renal cell carcinoma (first-line treatment) was not approvable 
nivolumab + ipilimumab for the treatment of adult patients with intermediate/poor-risk advanced renal 
cell carcinoma (first-line treatment) was not approvable, the applicant submitted detailed grounds for 
the re-examination of the grounds for refusal.  
5.1.  Detailed grounds for re-examination submitted by the applicant 
The applicant presented in writing and at an oral explanation arguments refuting the grounds for 
refusal. The MAH argumentation was as follows: 
Ground #1: Favourable benefit-risk profile versus sunitinib based on currently available 
data 
Unprecedented Benefit 
The primary analysis population (intermediate/poor risk) in CA209214 represents a population with a 
high unmet medical need (median OS for favourable risk patients is 43 months but for intermediate 
risk it is 23 months and poor risk, 8 months) with limited benefit from standard of care, sunitinib. 
While agents currently approved for treatment of 1L advanced RCC have demonstrated statistically 
significant benefits in terms of PFS, no agent in this population has been approved based upon OS 
benefit. In addition, no agent has demonstrated superiority to sunitinib based upon a Ph3 study in over 
the past ten years. 
In the Phase 3 CA209214 study, the nivolumab 3 mg/kg and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg combination regimen 
has demonstrated an unprecedented, statistically significant improvement in OS compared to the 
current standard of care, sunitinib, in previously untreated, intermediate or poor risk advanced RCC, 
reducing the risk of death by 37% (Figure 40).

Risk Subjects – 07-Aug-2017 Database Lock 
OS was favored with nivolumab + ipilimumab versus sunitinib across all predefined subgroups (Figure 
41). This improvement in OS was accompanied by a clinically meaningful 16% improvement in ORR 
(including complete responses in 9.4% of participants versus 1.2% in the sunitinib arm), as well as a 
3.2 month improvement in median PFS (Table 57). Depth of response has been shown to correlate 
with improved survival outcomes, emphasizing the clinical significance of the complete responses 
observed. 
The magnitude of OS benefit in CA209214 is striking given the availability of multiple effective 
systemic therapies for advanced RCC, reflected in the subsequent use of nivolumab in 28% of subjects 
in the sunitinib arm. The unprecedented 9.4% complete response rate, durability of responses, and OS 
benefit in CA209214 indicate that the nivolumab + ipilimumab combination may have the potential to 
cure some patients with advanced RCC.

Intermediate/Poor Risk Subjects – 07-Aug-2017 Database Lock 
Clinical benefit for OS for nivolumab + ipilimumab was seen regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression. 
Although the magnitude of benefit for nivolumab + ipilimumab compared to sunitinib was greater 
among PD-L1 positive (> 1% tumour expression) subjects (HR = 0.45), much of this difference was 
derived from the poorer performance of sunitinib in PD-L1 positive subjects (Figure 42) which is 
consistent with external studies which also found PD-L1 expression to be a significant predictor of 
worse outcomes in advanced RCC patients treated with anti-angiogenesis agents.3 However, even 
among PD-L1 negative (< 1% tumour expression) subjects in CA209214, Kaplan Meier curves show 
improved OS for nivolumab + ipilimumab compared to sunitinib (HR = 0.73). 
There was also a higher ORR observed with nivolumab + ipilimumab compared to sunitinib regardless 
of tumor PD-L1 expression level (Table 58). Only in evaluation of PFS was significant benefit of 
nivolumab + ipilimumab compared to sunitinib restricted to PD-L1 positive subjects while PFS was 
similar between treatment groups among PD-L1 negative subjects.

The safety profile of the combination is considered manageable and favourable compared to 
that of sunitinib (different MoA), supported by patient-reported outcome (PRO) data

The different mechanisms of action of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab and sunitinib result in 
differentiated safety profiles. Overall, the safety profile of the combination of nivolumab and 
ipilimumab is considered favourable compared to that of sunitinib, and together with the patient-
reported outcome data, show that, with the distinct safety profiles, the combination is overall, better 
tolerated than sunitinib. 
The combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab has a manageable safety profile with established 
algorithms for management of drug-related adverse events (AEs). These management algorithms are 
utilized for the approved nivolumab monotherapy indications as well as the nivolumab + ipilimumab (3 
mg) combination approved in 1L advanced melanoma. 
The better safety profile of the low dose ipilimumab (1 mg/kg) combination relative to the high dose 
ipilimumab (3 mg/kg) combination contributed to it being selected as the Phase 3 regimen given the 
comparable efficacy observed with the 2 combination regimens in CA209016, as well as in the broader 
combination program. 
Safety of N3/I1 vs Sunitinib in RCC (CA209214) 
In CA209214, the safety profiles of the nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg arm and the 
sunitinib arm were distinct, based on their different mechanisms of action.  
The clinical relevance of the safety profiles of the combination relative to sunitinib are further 
characterized below. 
Drug-Related Adverse Events Are Less Common and Frequency Tapers over Time with 
Nivolumab and Ipilimumab Compared to Sunitinib 
Figure 43 shows that among the most common any grade drug-related AEs (occurring in > 15% of 
subjects), the majority had a higher incidence in the sunitinib arm compared to the nivolumab + 
ipilimumab arm These include general AEs such as fatigue, dysgeusia, nausea and vomiting, which can 
be debilitating, in particular when chronic, and the prolonged duration of such events often can 
negatively impact QoL, which may compromise the ability to tolerate further treatment with sunitinib 
as well as subsequent therapies. Consistent with published safety information for sunitinib and other 
VEGF targeted therapies, patients in the sunitinib arm more commonly experience other events such 
diarrhea, palmar planter dysesthesia, stomatitis and haematological toxicities, which require careful 
management and often dose reductions to maintain tolerability. 
Hypertension is a common and often chronic toxicity which typically requires long term use of anti-
hypertensive medications and, if not properly managed, may result in serious complications. Notably, 
the majority of deaths associated with sunitinib-related toxicity were related to cardiac events. The 
common drug-related AEs that occurred more frequently in the combination of nivolumab with 
ipilimumab arm included pruritus and rash, which are often manageable and reversible with topical 
therapy, and an increase in serum lipase level, which is typically asymptomatic and of unknown clinical 
significance in the absence of clinical symptoms of pancreatitis.

Figure 43 Any-Grade-Drug-Related AEs (%) Occurring in ≥ 15% of Patients in Either 
Treatment Arm (All Treated Patients) -07-Aug-2017 Database Lock 
Given its MoA, the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab tends to be associated with AEs linked to 
over-stimulation of the immune system, with the most common events affecting skin, endocrine, and 
gastrointestinal (GI) systems. High-grade drug-related AEs are manageable with corticosteroid 
treatment, as recommended by established AE management algorithms, and the vast majority are 
reversible. Endocrine events may require long term hormone replacement therapy and, for that 
reason, may not be considered to be resolved. 
Figure 44 shows the proportion of subjects in each treatment group with ongoing Grade 3-4 drug -
related AEs, from time of onset to resolution, over the course of the study, starting from the first dose 
of study treatment. This figure shows that high grade drug-related events in the nivolumab + 
ipilimumab arm are most common early during the course of treatment, peaking at approximately 
10% of subjects around Day 80, which coincides with the end of the 4 combination doses, and then 
tapering off to a prevalence ≤ 2% during the nivolumab monotherapy phase. 
Figure 55 is a similar graphical presentation of the proportion of subjects with ongoing Grade 3-4 drug-
related AEs over time but broken down by different system organ classes (SOCs). This figure shows 
that the most common Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs in the nivolumab + ipilimumab arm belonged to the 
GI, endocrine, and skin disorders SOC, with peak prevalence during the time of the 4 combination 
doses, followed by a decreased and stable low prevalence during the nivolumab monotherapy phase.

Frequency of Sunitinib Toxicity is greater than Nivolumab and Ipilimumab over time with 
the frequency of Nivolumab and Ipilimumab Drug-related AEs Tapering over Time 
By contrast, high-grade drug-related AEs in the sunitinib arm were characterized by an early peak 
prevalence of approximately 20% of subjects within the first 40 days of treatment (coinciding with the 
first treatment cycle), followed by a decreased but saw-tooth pattern, likely coinciding with the 4 
weeks on, 2 weeks off dosing in each cycle (Figure 44). Unlike the steadily decreasing prevalence of 
high-grade drug-related AEs observed in the nivolumab + ipilimumab beyond Day 80, the sunitinib 
arm continued to demonstrate a saw-tooth pattern well beyond Day 80, with overall prevalence 
generally higher than that observed in the nivolumab + ipilimumab arm with longer treatment 
duration. Unlike the nivolumab + ipilimumab arm, the most common high-grade drug-related AEs in 
the sunitinib arm belonged to the vascular disorders (eg, hypertension), blood and lymphatic disorders 
(thrombocytopenia, anemia, neutropenia), GI (diarrhea, nausea/vomiting), and skin disorders (eg, 
palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia) SOCs (Figure 45). 
Since 53% of subjects in the sunitinib arm required dose reductions, it is possible that the decreasing 
prevalence of high-grade drug-related AEs over time may be related, in part, to dose reductions to 
manage toxicity. 
Overall, drug-related AEs, particularly Grade 3-4 events, were more common with sunitinib compared 
to nivolumab + ipilimumab. In addition, high-grade AEs related to nivolumab + ipilimumab were most 
common during the combination dosing phase, with prevalence tapering and stabilizing to < 2% during 
the nivolumab monotherapy phase. In contrast, high-grade AEs related to sunitinib were most common 
during the first cycle but continued to recur and subside with subsequent cycles, indicating a pattern of 
waxing and waning but chronic toxicity. The chronicity of overall vascular events in the sunitinib arm 
was particularly notable reflected in longer times to and low rates of resolution.

Select Adverse Events Occurred Early during Nivolumab + Ipilimumab Dosing and the 
Majority Resolve with Appropriate Management 
Select AEs are groupings of pre-specified event terms that reflect immune-mediated reactions affecting 
certain organ systems and commonly associated with nivolumab or ipilimumab treatment. Because 
these select AE categories are defined to characterize the safety profile of nivolumab and ipilimumab, 
these select AEs may not fully capture the safety profile of other therapies. Therefore, direct 
comparisons of select AEs between the nivolumab + ipilimumab arm and the sunitinib arm may not 
adequately capture additional sunitinib-associated safety events not seen with nivolumab + 
ipilimumab, or describe the relative safety between these treatment regimens in CA209214. 
With these caveats in mind, the frequencies of drug-related select AEs (any grade) were similar 
between the 2 arms in CA209214, with the exception of select GI and skin AEs, which were more 
common in the sunitinib arm (Table 59). The median time to onset of drug-related select AEs across all 
select AE categories was within 12 weeks of first dose in both treatment arms in CA209214. The 
majority of drug-related select AEs in the nivolumab + ipilimumab arm resolved within 6-12 weeks of 
onset with use of established algorithms for toxicity management, including use of immune modulating 
medications, except for some select endocrine AEs which were not considered resolved due to the 
continued need for hormone replacement therapy. The majority of drug-related select AEs in the 
sunitinib arm also resolved within 6-12 weeks, although time to resolution was longer for select GI and 
skin AEs and resolution of select GI events was less common with sunitinib (77%) compared to 
nivolumab + ipilimumab (92%). The frequency of resolution of select endocrine AEs in the sunitinib 
arm was similar to that in the nivolumab + ipilimumab arm.

Drug-related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) Were More Common with Nivolumab + 
Ipilimumab but Were Manageable and Did Not Lead to Worse Quality of Life Compared to 
Sunitinib 
The overall frequency of drug-related SAEs was higher in the nivolumab + ipilimumab arm compared 
to the sunitinib arm, 30% vs 15%. 
The majority of drug-related SAEs in the nivolumab + ipilimumab arm occurred during the combination 
dosing cycles, most commonly affecting the GI and endocrine systems, and the vast majority were 
reported as serious because they involved hospitalizations for management of AEs requiring use of 
intravenous steroids, which led to resolution in the majority of cases. Based on discussion with 
investigators, this higher frequency of SAEs in the nivolumab + ipilimumab arm compared to the 
sunitinib arm may be a reflection of clinicians’ limited clinical experience with managing immune 
mediated AEs at the time of active enrollment of the study. The frequency of total drug related AEs, 
particularly high grade AEs (Grade 3-4), was higher in the sunitinib arm, but physicians’ familiarity and 
prior experience with sunitinib toxicity led to more frequent management in the outpatient setting. 
With increasing clinical experience with managing immunotherapy toxicity, the frequency of SAEs 
related to nivolumab + ipilimumab is anticipated to decline over time. Given the high resolution rate 
and manageability of AEs related to nivolumab + ipilimumab, including SAEs, and the improved 
tolerability of the combination relative to sunitinib based on quality of life outcomes (described below), 
the higher frequency of drug-related SAE with nivolumab + ipilimumab in CA209214 do not indicate a 
worse safety profile compared to sunitinib. 
Drug-related AEs leading to Discontinuation Did Not Compromise Efficacy of Nivolumab + 
Ipilimumab 
Despite the higher discontinuation rate for toxicity in the combination arm, the median duration of 
therapy was similar in both arms (7.8 months), and 79% of patients on the combination arm were able 
to receive all 4 combination doses. It should be noted that dose reductions were not permitted on the

combination arm. 
While the nature and severity of AEs do lead to a higher rate of discontinuations in the nivolumab + 
ipilimumab arm than observed with sunitinib, patients who discontinue the combination regimen on 
account of toxicities continue to derive long term benefit from treatment. This is shown in Figure 46, 
where responses achieved with combination treatment in CA209214 were durable beyond last dose in 
patients who discontinued due to drug-related AEs, whereas responses with sunitinib were typically 
lost soon after the last dose of sunitinib. This durability of response beyond last dose suggests that 
patients treated with nivolumab + ipilimumab are likely to experience a prolonged treatment-free 
interval prior to starting subsequent therapy.

Deaths 
A lower proportion of treated subjects in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group (29.1%) died compared 
with the sunitinib group (37.8%). Disease progression was the most common cause of death for both 
groups, including deaths occurring within 100 days of last dose. The frequency of treatment related 
deaths was low in both arms, 7 deaths (1.3%) in nivolumab + ipilimumab group and 4 deaths (0.7%) 
in the sunitinib arm. BMS assessment for the cause of death for the 7 deaths in the nivolumab + 
ipilimumab group was “not related” in 4 cases, “related” in 2, and “needs more information” in 1. 
Among the 4 deaths attributed to sunitinib by the investigators, BMS assessment concurred with 3 as 
“related”, and 1 death was considered “unrelated”. The majority of drugrelated deaths were related to 
immune mediated adverse effects and complications due to steroid use while in the sunitinib arm it 
was due to cardiac events.

Overview of safety profiles 
Overall, the data above support that although the combination of nivolumab + ipilimumab and 
sunitinib had differential safety profiles, the combination was in many ways better tolerated than 
sunitinib based on the overall incidence, type and timing of AEs as well as the total proportion of 
subjects affected at any given time during the study. Although there was a higher discontinuation rate 
with nivolumab + ipilimumab arm than sunitinib this is partly due to the ability to dose reduce sunitinib 
at the expense of efficacy and the majority of patients who discontinued due to toxicity in nivolumab + 
ipilimumab arm continued to derive efficacy benefit. 
Nivolumab + ipilimumab is well tolerated, as indicated by maintenance of high HRQoL and 
low symptom burden for a longer period of time compared to sunitinib. 
Better PRO scores were consistently observed for nivolumab + ipilimumab over sunitinib for all PRO 
analyses across all instruments. The FKSI-19 scale is of particular interest because it was specifically 
designed for patients with RCC and outcomes have been reflected in the SmPC for 2L RCC based on 
evaluation of data from the CA209025 study. Results are presented below for the FKSI Disease Related 
Symptoms (DRS), since a minimally important difference is established in the literature for this FKSI-
19 subscale. Results are similar for additional instruments. Change from baseline showed an 
advantage for nivolumab + ipilimumab over sunitinib for the FKSI DRS (Figure 47); the mean change 
from baseline was greater in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group than in the sunitinib group during the 
first 6 months (P<0.05). Similar results were shown in FACT and EQ-5D. The pattern-mixture model 
and the mixed model repeated-measures analyses indicated a significant difference in favor of 
nivolumab + ipilimumab, which substantiated the descriptive results.

The applicant acknowledges the concern of the interpretability of data from open label studies; that is, 
the treatment benefit of experimental therapies may be biased, particularly for subjective outcomes 
such as HRQoL, when there is a lack of blinding. In this study, blinding was not feasible, since sunitinib 
was administered orally, and nivolumab + ipilimumab was administered intravenously. However, when 
coupled with the OS benefit observed, there is increased confidence in the reliability of the PRO 
assessments despite the open-label nature of the study. Results indicate better tolerability and 
superior quality of life compared to sunitinib, even in the presence of AEs. The significance of this 
observation was further supported by feedback from leading investigatorsin RCC. 
Overall benefit/risk profile of nivolumab + ipilimumab combination in advanced RCC 
The totality of available data support favourable benefit-risk for the combination of nivolumab and 
ipilimumab compared to sunitinib. The combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab has demonstrated 
unprecedented efficacy benefit compared to available therapies as evidenced by statistically significant 
and highly positive OS and ORR benefit (which included a 9.4% CR rate) along with a positive trend in 
PFS. The safety profile shows that the combination of nivolumab + ipilimumab has distinct toxicities 
from sunitinib owing to different mechanisms of action, but overall toxicities are less frequent with 
nivolumab + ipilimumab, the majority occur within the initial few weeks of initiating treatment and are 
well managed with established treatmentalgorithms which result in resolution in most cases. In 
contrast, sunitinib toxicity commonly affects skin, GI, and vascular systems, with longer times to 
resolution and often requiring chronic management as long as sunitinib dosing continues. 
Approximately 20% of subjects discontinued nivolumab + ipilimumab due to toxicity, but efficacy 
benefit is still maintained in these patients, with quality of life (PRO) improvements from baseline over 
time and, importantly, significant delay in time to deterioration relative to sunitinib across all 
instruments.

The unprecedented OS benefit observed, together with the manageable and well-tolerated safety 
profile relative to sunitinib, is therefore considered to outweigh the added toxicity of ipilimumab to the 
combination. 
Ground #2: Available data support the additional benefit of the combination relative to 
nivolumab monotherapy for the treatment of 1L RCC 
Available clinical and non-clinical data suggest that the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab 
provides greater benefit than nivolumab monotherapy. 
-  Nivolumab (anti-PD-1) and ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) target distinct immune checkpoint proteins 
with complementary roles in regulating immune responses. 
-  At the time of initiation of CA209214, the decision to investigate the combination of nivolumab and 
ipilimumab was based on the knowledge of the science and data available at the time, with the broader 
objective of bringing patients an overall survival benefit versus standard of care which had not been 
demonstrated with any other regimen.  
-  The activity of nivolumab monotherapy in RCC (1L & 2L) was observed in the Phase 1 studies 
CA209009 and CA209010. 
-  The activity of ipilimumab monotherapy in RCC (1L & 2L) was observed in completed trial MDX010-
11. 
-  The incremental activity of the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab (relative to that observed 
with nivolumab monotherapy) was observed in CA209004 in advanced melanoma. Given the 
mechanism of action, a similar incremental benefit was expected in a range of solid tumours 
susceptible to immunotherapy, including RCC. 
-  CHMP scientific advice with respect to combination development (in accordance with the EU 
anticancer guideline) in melanoma was sought in 2012. Additionally, CHMP advice had also been 
sought earlier for development of nivolumab monotherapy in 2L RCC, where the data from the studies 
CA209009 and CA209010 were presented to help characterize the patient population for the proposed 
Phase 3 study. 
-  CA209016 informed the incremental benefit of the combination in RCC at different dose ratios, with 
all dose ratios demonstrating incremental benefit (and toxicity) to nivolumab monotherapy, providing 
evidence of the added benefit of ipilimumab. Comparable outcomes with respect to response were 
observed with nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg combination and nivolumab 1 mg/kg + 
ipilimumab 3 mg/kg and the nivolumab 3 mg/kg and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg combination was selected for 
Phase 3 based on a better tolerated safety profile. 
-  Acknowledging the limitations of the available data sources including small sample sizes and patient 
heterogeneity, based on the biological rationale and knowledge of the science at the time, BMS 
considered the totality of the available evidence was sufficient to initiate Phase 3 development with the 
objective of demonstrating a survival benefit.

Table 60 Efficacy of Nivolumab and Ipilimumab as Monotherapry or Combination 
Therapry in Subjects With RCC 
ognising the importance of characterizing the contribution of ipilimumab, in particular to establish the 
benefit/risk profile of the combination relative to nivolumab monotherapy, BMS proposes to undertake 
a robust, post-approval clinical study to confirm the magnitude of benefit from the addition of 
ipilimumab 1 mg/kg to the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab in 1L RCC. Contemporary data in 
1L RCC for PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapies that has recently been published further support the feasibility 
of this characterisation.

Rec
Post-Approval Efficacy Study (PAES) Proposal 
In order to address the contribution of ipilimumab at 1 mg/kg to the magnitude of benefit of the 
combination regimen, BMS proposes a post-approval randomized, double-blind clinical study of 
nivolumab + ipilimumab versus nivolumab monotherapy + placebo in patients with previously 
untreated, intermediate/poor risk advanced RCC. A draft study synopsis and draft Statistical Analysis 
Plan (SAP) is provided by the applicant. The study proposal has been designed in consideration of the 
feedback received from CHMP during the initial review of the Type II variation (WS1278) as outlined 
below (Figure 49): 
•  The study is a double-blind, randomized, controlled study comparing the combination of nivolumab 
and ipilimumab (as evaluated in CA209214) to nivolumab monotherapy in the same patient population 
as CA209214. 
•  The PFS primary endpoint of the study is considered informative in the context of a comparison 
between 2 cancer immunotherapy regimens and additionally, is expected to provide conclusive 
evidence of the benefit of the combination relative to nivolumab monotherapy in a reliable and 
interpretable way within a reasonable timeframe (including sample size determination and timelines for 
read-out of interim and final results) 
•  The design of the study factors in feasibility of conduct, including in European subjects, and aims to 
leverage the enrollment window in Europe following approval, but prior to access. 
In the absence of a clear demonstration of benefit for the combination versus nivolumab 
• 
monotherapy, the study should enable a robust comparison of nivolumab monotherapy to sunitinib (in 
CA209214) via a meta-analysis.

Figure 49 Proposed Draft Study Design of Post-Approval Efficacy Study (PAES) 
Dose of nivolumab in Arm B reflects the exposure consistent with approved nivolumab monotherapy 
dosing in RCC. 
The purpose of this study is to establish the benefit/risk of the combination over nivolumab 
monotherapy in intermediate/poor risk patients in first line metastatic RCC. In the event that 
superiority of the combination over nivolumab monotherapy is not clearly established by a statistically 
positive result, the efficacy of nivolumab monotherapy will be compared to sunitinib through a “meta-
analysis” of data from this study and CA209214, as described in the draft SAP. This step-wise 
approach is described in more detail below and illustrated in Figure 50: 
Proposed Efficacy Assessment 
1) The primary endpoint of PFS will be compared between nivolumab + ipilimumab and nivolumab 
monotherapy for superiority based on statistical assumptions provided in Section 4.1 of the draft SAP. 
2) If the primary endpoint of PFS is not significantly improved, the PFS HR and CI will provide an 
estimate of the relative difference between the 2 arms. An OS meta-analysis comparing nivolumab to 
sunitinib will be performed at the time of the primary PFS analysis of nivolumab + ipilimumab and 
nivolumab monotherapy from the post-approval study. 
3) The final OS meta-analysis comparing nivolumab monotherapy to sunitinib will be conducted after a 
minimum follow-up of approximately 18 months in the post-approval study to match the duration of 
follow-up at the time of the final analysis of CA209214.

Figure 50 The decision pathway for the step-wise approach to establish the benefit of the 
combination relative to nivolumab monotherapy 
The feasibility of the proposed trial has been confirmed by multiple ongoing investigator-sponsored 
trials and discussion with several thought leaders. 
The MAH commits to working closely with the Rapporteurs and CHMP on next steps including SmPC 
updates following the availability of the results of the study to ensure appropriate characterization of 
benefit/risk of the combination and/or nivolumab monotherapy in 1L mRCC.  
The proposed study would be initiated by 1Q of 2019 to optimize the enrollment window. 
The Study Will Provide a Conclusive Result 
The inclusion of the additional stage (meta-analysis of nivolumab versus sunitinib from CA209214) 
builds in the safeguard of being able to reach a conclusion on the B/R of the combination relative to 
nivolumab monotherapy conclusively regardless of whether a positive outcome of the primary endpoint 
is achieved. In the event that the superiority of the combination is not demonstrated over nivolumab 
monotherapy, it lays out, in a step-wise fashion, a plan to determine if nivolumab monotherapy shows 
efficacy benefit over sunitinib and, if so, the magnitude of this relative benefit. Planned exploratory 
analyses based on stratification criteria such as tumour PD-L1 expression and IMDC risk-criteria as well 
as additional predefined subgroups will attempt to determine if a differential benefit/risk profile is seen 
in any subgroups.

Choice of Endpoints 
In randomized studies, PFS is a generally a reliable measure of antitumor activity that is not 
confounded by subsequent therapies, and it has historically served as an acceptable regulatory 
endpoint for approval of new systemic therapies in first-line advanced RCC. Although statistically 
significant improvement in PFS was not demonstrated in CA209214 or in the Phase 3 study of 
nivolumab monotherapy in previously treated advanced RCC (CA209025), these studies compared 
nivolumab + ipilimumab (CA209214) or nivolumab alone (CA209025) to non-immunotherapies 
(sunitinib and everolimus in CA209214 and CA209025, respectively). PFS as per RECIST v1.1, 
however, is considered informative in the context of comparison between 2 immunotherapy regimens. 
In the CA209067 study in melanoma, a clear separation of PFS curves between nivolumab + 
ipilimumab and nivolumab monotherapy was seen at the time of initial assessment at 3 months, 
indicating it be an informative endpoint when comparing 2 cancer immunotherapy regimens. In 
addition to using standard RECIST, evaluation of PFS by irRECIST is also planned as an exploratory 
analysis. In the event that the combination fails to show PFS superiority over nivolumab monotherapy, 
the second part of the study will use OS to evaluate the relative benefit of nivolumab monotherapy 
from the OS results from the proposed study over the sunitinib arm in CA209214. This interim OS 
analysis would occur at time of primary PFS analysis at approximately 19 months from study start, and 
final OS analysis would be conducted approximately 12 months later, after a minimum followup of 18 
months in the proposed study, when OS is expected to reach full maturity for comparison. ORR, OS, 
safety, and quality of life will be secondary endpoints. Exploratory analyses of efficacy based on PD-L1 
expression, biomarkers, PK and in predefined subgroups will allow evaluation of differential efficacy in 
subpopulations. 
Assumptions for PFS 
In the proposed post-approval study of nivolumab + ipilimumab versus nivolumab in first-line 
advanced RCC, both treatments are immunotherapies which are expected to display a similar delayed 
effect on PFS, leading to a more valid comparison of this endpoint. Indeed, in the Phase 3 study of 
nivolumab + ipilimumab or nivolumab versus ipilimumab in first-line advanced melanoma (CA209067), 
the combination demonstrated PFS benefit compared to nivolumab onotherapy in an exploratory 
analysis (PFS HR 0.76 [95% CI 0.62, 0.94]). Based on these results, the target PFS HR will be 0.76 for 
the proposed post-approval study, which is considered clinically meaningful based on results of studies 
which have supported recent EU approvals in first line RCC. Using a 1-sided alpha of 0.1 and 80% 
power, the sample size for the proposed post-approval study is 418 subjects (209 per arm). An interim 
analysis for PFS is planned to be conducted at 75% of events, estimated to occur at approximately 15 
months from study start, with the final PFS analysis anticipated to occur at approximately 19 months 
from study start. Recognising that the study is retrospective and in the post-approval setting, it has 
been designed/powered to robustly evaluate the benefit/risk of the combination relative to nivolumab 
monotherapy. 
Implementation Plan 
Based on the observed accrual rate of ~50 intermediate/poor risk subjects per month observed in 
CA209214 and recent feedback from RCC investigators in several EU and non-EU countries, an accrual 
of 35 intermediate/poor risk advanced RCC patients per month is estimated for the  postapproval 
study, anticipated to begin enrollment in 1Q 2019. Given the evolving treatment landscape in first-line 
advanced RCC, there is currently interest in exploring a PD-1 monotherapy approach in this population. 
The post-approval study would complete enrollment in approximately 12 months, and the final analysis 
of PFS would be 19 months after the start of enrollment.  
Assessment report  
EMA/902855/2019  
Page 149/176 
 
 
 
An interim analysis of PFS at 15 months (75% of events) may also be included, with the appropriate 
alpha spend (Table 61). The meta-analysis of these 2 studies, combining with CA209214, would be 
used for an indirect treatment comparison of the nivolumab monotherapy arm to the sunitinib arm with 
the common nivolumab + ipilimumab arm linking the 2 studies. 
Given the results of the proposed study and the large treatment effect observed in the CA209214 
study, the OS boundary in the meta-analysis is expected to be met, ie superiority of nivolumab over 
sunitinib would still be demonstrated even if nivolumab + ipilimumab is not shown to be superior to 
nivolumab in the proposed study. With approximately 209 nivolumab patients compared to 422 
sunitinib patients, for a total of 631 patients, an HR<0.81 (nivolumab versus sunitinib) would yield 
95% CIs that exclude 1, which is expected due to the large treatment effect of nivolumab + 
ipilimumab over sunitinib observed in study CA209214. The details of statistical analysis are provided 
in the study synopsis and draft SAP. 
BMS also proposes to seek CHMP scientific advice on the proposed study to ensure that the study can 
deliver on its objectives. The request for advice is planned to be submitted to ensure that the study 
can be initiated by 1Q 2019 to optimize the enrolment window (prior to access). 
Table 61 Draft Study Endpoints and timelines for Post-Approval Efficacy Study (PAES) 
SmPC Updates 
In the absence of comprehensive clinical data demonstrating the contribution of ipilimumab, the 
applicant proposes to include a statement in Section 4.4 of the SmPC indicating that the benefit of the 
combination relative to nivolumab monotherapy in 1L RCC has not been evaluated. The statement is as 
follows: 
“The benefit of the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab relative to nivolumab monotherapy in the 
first-line treatment of advanced RCC patients has not been evaluated.” 
Pending confirmation of the benefit of the combination relative to nivolumab monotherapy and the 
potential for increased risk (relative to nivolumab monotherapy), efficacy and safety analyses were 
undertaken to identify any patient population where there is a potential differential benefit/risk for the 
combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab relative to sunitinib. While benefit of the combination 
relative to sunitinib was consistently demonstrated across subgroups, BMS are receptive to addressing 
the outstanding uncertainties through the SmPC and RMP as appropriate.

5.2.  Scientific Advisory Group-Oncology consultation 
Following a request from the MAH at the time of the re-examination of the CHMP opinion concerning 
the use of Opidvo/Yervoy for the first-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), the CHMP has 
convened a Scientific Advisory Group (SAG) to discuss the following issues. 
1.  The experts are invited to provide their views on the CHMP grounds for refusal, taking 
into account the company’s response: 
-  There is no basis to establish or to quantify any benefits conferred by 1 mg/kg 
ipilimumab as used in combination with 3 mg/kg nivolumab in the first-line treatment of 
intermediate/poor-risk advanced renal cell carcinoma patients, and specifically whether 
ipilimumab contributes to the efficacy of the combination therapy to an extent that 
outweighs the substantial additional toxicity. Therefore, the safety and efficacy of the 
combination cannot be considered properly or sufficiently demonstrated and a 
comprehensive assessment of the benefits and risks associated with the combination and its 
components cannot be completed in this case. The benefit-risk balance of the combination 
treatment with nivolumab and ipilimumab in this setting must thus currently be regarded as 
unsubstantiated. 
The SAG disagreed with the grounds for refusal noting that the benefit-risk balance for the combination 
is clearly positive based on a convincing and clinically important improvement in overall survival 
compared to sunitinib, based on a robust clinical trial and supportive evidence, despite the fact that 
quantification of the individual contributions in the combination cannot be quantified precisely.  
The safety and efficacy of the combination, considered as a whole, is clearly established according to 
robust evidence and meeting stringent scientific and clinical standards. The benefit-risk balance of the 
combination has been convincingly substantiated to the extent that it is already included in current 
clinical guidelines. The possibility that ipilimumab may add more harms than benefits, although 
considered unlikely, cannot change the overall benefit-risk of the combination, which is clearly 
favourable.  
Given the available evidence, it would be very difficult for physicians and patients to understand how 
lack of a precise quantification of the effect of the individual elements of a combination could result in 
an overall negative risk-benefit of a combination that has shown a clinically important increase in 
overall survival with acceptable toxicity compared to a n adequate control. Such an assessment would 
deprive patients in a high unmet medical need of a clear opportunity in terms of improving overall 
survival, with a potential for long-term survival associated with some immunotherapies.  
Questions concerning the suboptimal dosing or the potential unnecessary toxicity associated with one 
element of the combination might be explored in further optimisation studies if considered worthwhile. 
However, it may be more important to try to identify patients more likely to respond to this particular 
combination, also given that a number of other treatments and combinations are currently being 
developed and there will be a need to identify factors to inform clinical decisions.

Concerning patient reported outcomes which were analysed as secondary endpoints using different 
scales, small differences were observed in the mean score of the FACT-G favouring nivolumab + 
ipilimumab compared to sunitinib. Although no strong claims can be made on the basis of secondary 
analyses, the results do not raise any issues about excessive toxicity at end of treatment. From a 
patient perspective, these results are encouraging. Taken together with the outstanding results in 
terms of overall survival that have not been observed for other treatments options so far, there is a 
clear preference for the combination compared to sunitinib. 
Concerns about “setting precedents” about methodological principles advocating a fully factorial design 
were considered unjustified on the basis of the large benefit observed in terms of overall survival that 
has not been observed with other treatment options, and the convincing scientific rationale and 
supportive evidence for the combination (see answer to question No. 2). In any case, any arguable 
deviation from general methodological principles would be considered justified on grounds of improving 
the outcome for RCC patients. Deviations from general principles and guidelines are justified in 
situations where dramatic activity is observed in situations with high unmet medical need. Concerns 
about subsequent therapies and lack of “cross-over” were considered unfounded because the 
objectives of the trial were to increase overall survival and the design of the study was appropriate to 
assess this objective.  
One expert disagreed, considering that one should be cautious in extrapolating from melanoma to 
renal cancer because a different response to ant-PD-1 therapies was observed (different slopes of the 
overall survival curves; lack of a “plateau” in long-term survival in RCC as opposed to melanoma). 
Furthermore, given the lack of systematic “cross-over” after progression in the pivotal trial (only about 
20% of patients assigned to sunitinib received subsequent treatment with nivolumab), the benefit in 
terms of overall survival may have been over-estimated. Thus, a fully factorial design should thus have 
been necessary to establish the additive role of the combination. Such trial should be conducted prior 
to marketing authorisation and the delay in access would not expose patients to unacceptable loss of 
opportunity given the availability of the kinase inhibitor cabozantinib that was associated with an 
improvement in progression-free survival compared to sunitinib (albeit based on less comprehensive 
clinical evidence, i.e., a randomised phase II trial and no significant difference in overall survival, 
which, however, was not the primary end-point of this trial). The next best option would be to make it 
mandatory to complete a comparative analysis of ipilimumab/nivolumab versus anti-PD-1 
monotherapy within a meaningful time frame, e.g. 2 years post-approval, and to revise the indication 
accordingly (see also answer to question No. 3). 
In addition to providing their views on the CHMP grounds for refusal, the experts are invited 
to provide input on the following questions. 
2.  Please discuss the strength of available data for the additive effect of ipilimumab at 1 
mg/kg to the efficacy of the combination of nivolumab + ipilimumab in the treatment of 1L 
RCC. 
The trial was not designed to assess the additive effect of ipilimumab or nivolumab to the combination. 
Thus, robust clinical evidence to assess the individual contribution is lacking. However, concerning 
ipilimumab at the studied dose, there is evidence of (admittedly low) activity as single-agent in RCC. 
Also, relevant activity of the combination has been established in melanoma for ipilimumab 
monotherapy and especially for the combination with nivolumab. With reference to scientific rationale, 
CTLA-4 being the drug target for ipilimumab and PD-1, being target for nivolumab, these monoclonal 
antibodies have separate immunological “break functions”, indicating the potential value by combining 
them. The drugs have in addition partly different side-effect profiles. In conclusion, based on 
mechanistic arguments and extrapolation, there is sufficient evidence to support a role for ipilimumab 
to the efficacy of the combination. 
Assessment report  
EMA/902855/2019  
Page 152/176 
 
 
 
One SAG expert disagreed, considering that a factorial design should have been necessary and should 
be conducted prior to marketing authorisation (see answer to question No. 1). 
3.  Would equipoise remain for randomizing patients to nivolumab alone versus 
ipilimumab/nivolumab after a marketing authorization for 1L RCC? Does equipoise remain if 
ipilimumab/nivolumab is not authorized for such use? 
This study design implies a hypothesis that similar efficacy might be achieved with less toxicity with 
nivolumab alone compared to the combination of ipilimumab plus nivolumab. The SAG debated this 
hypothesis and considered that it was unlikely given the supportive evidence for the added activity of 
ipilimumab in the combination (other trials with drugs with a similar mechanism of action to nivolumab 
are exploring the efficacy in monotherapy). Also, because of the widely recognised important effect 
and magnitude on overall survival of the combination with acceptable toxicity, the goal of minimising 
toxicity at the possible expense of efficacy is unlikely to be of high priority given the urgent need for 
further improvement of long-term outcome of RCC patients. Nevertheless, in oncology it is not 
uncommon to deconstruct or de-escalate established regimens seeking to optimise treatment. Thus, 
depending on individual judgments on the strength of evidence and need to minimise toxicity, some 
clinicians and patients might find that equipoise would hold.  
It may be more important to try to identify patients more likely to respond to this combination to guide 
treatment decisions. Even more important will be to determine the relative efficacy of different 
combinations or monotherapies in first-line treatment of metastatic RCC and sequencing of different 
options as they become available. Given the number of agents and combinations being developed the 
task will be challenging. There is an opportunity for academic trials to address some of these 
questions. 
According to one expert, this was indeed a relevant hypothesis and the trial should be conducted 
before marketing authorisation. Clinical evidence for single-agent anti-PD-1 therapy in 1st line RCC has 
been observed for pembrolizumab (also an anti-PD-1 agent) in a large exploratory study showing 
similar activity in terms of ORR with greatly reduced toxicity if indirectly compared to the combination 
of ipilimumab and nivolumab in RCC (ASCO 2018). 
5.3.  Discussion and overall conclusion on grounds for re-examination  
The CHMP assessed all the detailed grounds for re-examination and argumentations presented by the 
applicant and considered the views of the Scientific Advisory Group, including clinical experts and 
patients. 
The CHMP considered that based on general methodological principles, in order to establish the efficacy 
and safety of each product in this combination, an appropriate phase III design would have been a 
randomised three-arm study of nivolumab+ipilimumab v. nivolumab v. reference treatment.  
Assessment report  
EMA/902855/2019  
Page 153/176 
 
 
 
However, despite the fact that such study has not been submitted by the applicant, the efficacy of 
nivolumab in the combination can be considered established on the basis of the overall clinical results 
and monotherapy data. Concerning ipilimumab, although conclusive clinical trials investigating its 
activity as monotherapy at the proposed dose in RCC are lacking, the inference of the contribution to 
efficacy can be considered sufficiently established based on a cogent biological and pharmacological 
rationale, as well as relevant non-clinical and clinical data such as the activity shown in a B16 tumour 
mouse model in melanoma, evidence of single-agent activity in melanoma, the established contribution 
of ipilimumab to the combination with nivolumab in melanoma, and the consideration that these 
effects are relevant for RCC on the basis of the mechanism of action. 
Therefore, based on the totality of evidence the CHMP concluded that,  
•  The benefits of the combination treatment were considered to outweigh the risks, including the 
uncertainties regarding the precise contribution of ipilimumab at the studied dose, as the combination 
is associated with clinically important improvement in overall survival compared to sunitinib, with a 
manageable toxicity profile that is not worse than that of the comparator. The comparator is 
considered adequate and there are no treatment options that offer similar advantages without 
additional uncertainty in the target population. 
•  The inference of the contribution of ipilimumab to the benefits of the combination regimen is 
sufficiently established on the basis of the complementary mechanisms of action of the two agents in 
the combination, the activity shown in a B16 tumour mouse model in melanoma, evidence of single-
agent activity in melanoma, the established contribution of ipilimumab to the combination with 
nivolumab in melanoma, and the consideration that these effects are relevant for RCC on the basis of 
the mechanism of action. 
•  Further studies will be conducted to address remaining uncertainties and provide a more precise 
understanding about the contribution of ipilimumab to the combination.  
Taken together, the CHMP considered that there was sufficient evidence that efficacy and safety of 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg have been established and that the remaining 
uncertainties can be accepted as they are outweighed by the large survival benefit observed for the 
combination compared to the current standard. Therefore, the safety, efficacy, and a positive balance 
of benefits and risks of the combination and its components are considered sufficiently established. 
5.4.  Risk Management Plan 
The WSA submitted updated RMP version (revised proposed Risk Management Plan, OPDIVO RMP 
version 13.2 and YERVOY RMP version 23.1) with this application (re-examination).  
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 13.3 for Opdivo and 23.2 for Yervoy are

5.5.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC for 
Opdivo and Yervoy have been updated. The Annex II and the Package Leaflet have been updated 
accordingly. 
In addition, the Worksharing applicant (WSA) took the opportunity to correct some typos throughout 
the Yervoy and Opdivo product information. 
5.5.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the WSA and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
•  The readability of the PL (QRD template Version 9.0) of OPDIVO (nivolumab) and Yervoy 
(ipilimumab), in English, was assessed during the assessment of the initial Marketing Authorisation 
Application (MAA) according to the methods outlined in the European Commission’s guideline   
•  The new indication that is hereby applied for concerns the same route of administration and has a 
similar safety profile as the previously approved indications. 
•  Administration of is done by a health care professional. The instructions for dose calculation, 
preparation, administration, storage and disposal that are currently reflected in the approved PL 
remain unchanged. 
•  The general design and layout of the proposed PL have not changed compared to the tested one. 
6.  Benefit-risk balance 
6.1.  Therapeutic Context 
6.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed indication for nivolumab + ipilimumab is for the treatment of adult patients with 
intermediate/poor-risk advanced renal cell carcinoma (first-line treatment). 
Assessment report  
EMA/902855/2019  
Page 163/176 
 
 
 
 
 
6.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
According to ESMO guidelines and NCCN guidelines, sunitinib, bevacizumab plus interferon, and 
pazopanib are all standard treatment options for favourable and intermediate-risk patients in the first-
line treatment of RCC. Currently, the median OS of patients with advanced RCC is estimated to be 
around 8 months for poor-risk patients, 23 months for intermediate-risk patients and 43 months for 
favourable-risk patients, indicating the need for improved treatments. The standard treatment option 
in previously untreated RCC patients is sunitinib for favourable/intermediate-risk patients. For poor-
risk patients, the standard treatment option can either be sunitinib or temsirolimus. Also, cabozantinib 
was recently approved in this setting. The median OS is less than 4 years for treatment-naive patients 
with the most favourable prognosis, and less than 1 year in patients with poor prognosis, indicating the 
need for more efficacious therapies. Nivolumab is currently indicated for second-line treatment of RCC, 
while ipilimumab currently has no approved indication in RCC. 
6.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main study was CA209214, a phase 3, randomised, open-label study of nivolumab 3 mg/kg 
combined with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses followed by nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 
weeks, vs. sunitinib monotherapy using the approved dose and schedule (50 mg orally once daily for 4 
weeks followed by 2 weeks off, every cycle) in adults (≥ 18 years) with previously untreated advanced 
RCC. All randomised subjects included previously untreated favourable, intermediate and poor-risk 
advanced RCC patients (according to Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium criteria). 
The primary objective of the study was to determine OS, PFS and ORR in the subset of 
intermediate/poor-risk patients, as analysis of this subset of patients in the primary analysis would 
allow for potential meaningful differences in efficacy to be detected earlier than if favourable-risk 
patients were also included in the primary efficacy analysis. 
6.2.  Favourable effects 
A statistically significant difference in OS was observed in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group compared 
to the sunitinib group in intermediate/poor-risk subjects (HR: 0.63 [99.8% CI: 0.44, 0.89]; stratified 
log-rank 2-sided p-value < 0.0001). The median OS was not reached for the nivolumab + ipilimumab 
group and 25.95 months for the sunitinib group. The OS rates were 89.5% and 86.2% at 6 months, 
and 80.1% and 72.1% at 12 months in the nivolumab + ipilimumab and the sunitinib groups, 
respectively. K-M curves separated after approximately 3 months, favouring nivolumab + ipilimumab. 
Updated OS data confirmed previous data (HR: 0.66 [95% CI: 0.54, 0.81]; p-value < 0.0001).  
A numerical difference in PFS was found favouring the nivolumab + ipilimumab group (HR = 0.82, 
[99.1% CI: 0.64,1.05], p-value: 0.0331). Median PFS was 11.56 months (95% CI: 8.71, 15.51) and 
8.38 months in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group and the sunitinib group, respectively. The 12-month 
PFS rate was 49.6% in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group and 42.6% in the sunitinib group.  
The independent radiology review committee (IRRC)-assessed ORR was higher in the nivolumab + 
ipilimumab group (41.6% [95% CI: 36.9, 46.5]) than in the sunitinib group (26.5% [95% CI: 22.4, 
31.0]). The stratified difference in ORR (nivolumab + ipilimumab - sunitinib) was 16.0% (95% CI: 9.8, 
22.2), p-value < 0.0001. BOR was CR in 9.4% and 1.2 % of subjects, BOR was PR in 32.2% and 
25.4% of subjects and BOR was SD in 31.3% and 44.5% of subjects in the nivolumab + ipilimumab 
group and in the sunitinib group, respectively. DOR was not reached at the time of database lock in the 
nivolumab + ipilimumab group and was 18.17 months in the sunitinib group.

Subgroup analyses showed that the unstratified HR for OS for nivolumab + ipilimumab vs. sunitinib 
was 0.53 (95% CI: 0.40, 0.71) for patients aged <65 years, as compared to HR 0.86 (95% CI: 0.40, 
0.71) and 0.97 (95% CI: 0.40, 0.71) for patients aged ≥65 years and patients aged <75–≥75, 
respectively.  
Subgroup analyses showed that the unstratified HR for OS for nivolumab + ipilimumab vs. sunitinib 
was 0.55 (95% CI: 0.41, 0.73) for patients with Karnofsky performance status (KPS) 90-100 
compared to HR 0.86 (95% CI: 0.61, 1.20) for patients with KPS <90.  
Subgroup analyses showed that the unstratified HR for OS for nivolumab + ipilimumab vs. sunitinib 
was 0.45 (95% CI: 0.29, 0.71) for patients with baseline PD-L1-positive status (≥1%) versus HR 0.73 
(95% CI: 0.56, 0.96) for patients with baseline PD-L1-negative status (<1%). 
6.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The most critical uncertainty in this application remains the contribution of ipilimumab to the efficacy 
of the combination therapy nivolumab + ipilimumab. However, a positive contribution of ipilimumab is 
considered supported on the basis of the plausible mechanism of action of the two agents in the 
combination, evidence of single-agent activity in melanoma, and the established contribution of 
ipilimumab to nivolumab in melanoma (which is considered relevant in terms of mechanism of action); 
the more precise contribution of ipilimumab to efficacy of the combination will be further addressed in 
future studies [Annex II PAES]. 
Tumour PD-L1 expression (<1% vs. ≥1%) had an effect on OS (HR: 0.73 [95% CI: 0.56, 0.96] vs. 
HR: 0.45 [95% CI: 0.29, 0.71]), PFS (HR: 1.06 [95% CI: 0.87, 1.36] vs. HR: 0.45 [95% CI: 0.29, 
0.71]) and ORR (36.8% vs. 47.1%). However, the methods used to score PD-L1 expression in tumour 
tissue were suboptimal (e.g. immune cell expression was not taken into account). Updated PD-L1 
analyses are required to determine the role of PD-L1 expression in the efficacy of the combination 
therapy. This will be further evaluated in the PAES [Annex II]. 
Additional biomarkers for efficacy of nivolumab + ipilimumab are available which may have an impact 
on the benefit/risk of the combination treatment in subgroups of patients. These biomarkers include 
tumour mutational burden, tumour infiltrating lymphocytes, gene expression profiling, and single 
nucleotide polymorphism in immune-related genes. These biomarker analyses were not included in the 
CSR while these were planned to be analysed by the applicant. The applicant is recommended to 
provide these additional biomarker data post approval. 
6.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The most frequently reported drug-related AEs in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group were fatigue 
(36.9%), pruritus (28.2%), diarrhoea (26.5%), and rash (21.6%). In the sunitinib group, the most 
frequently reported drug-related AEs were diarrhoea (52.0%), fatigue (49.3%), palmar-plantar 
erythrodysesthesia syndrome (43.2%), hypertension (40.4%), nausea (37.8%), and dysgeusia 
(33.5%).  
Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs were reported in 45.7% of subjects in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group 
and 62.6% of subjects in the sunitinib group. In the nivolumab + ipilimumab group, the most 
frequently reported Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs were lipase increased (10.2%), amylase increased 
(5.7%), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased (4.9%), fatigue (4.2%), and diarrhoea (3.8%). In 
the sunitinib group, the most frequently reported Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs reported were 
hypertension (15.9%), fatigue (9.2%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (9.2%), platelet 
count decreased (6.7%), lipase increased (6.5%), neutropaenia (6.0%), and diarrhoea (5.2%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/902855/2019

SAEs were reported in 55.8% of subjects in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group and 39.8% of subjects 
in the sunitinib group. 
In patients <65 years of age SEAs occurred with a frequency of 52.4%, while in patients 75-84 years 
of age the frequency was 65.1%. Fatal AEs occurred in 2.4% of patients <65 years of age, versus 
16.3% of patients 75-84 years of age. 
The most frequently reported any-grade drug-related select AE categories in the ipilimumab + 
nivolumab group were skin (48.8%), endocrine (32.5%), and gastrointestinal (28.2%); versus 56.8%, 
30.5%, and 52.0%, respectively, in the sunitinib group. 
In the sunitinib group, 2 (0.4%) subjects reported late-emergent drug-related AEs, and 1 subject was 
intermediate/poor-risk. In the nivolumab + ipilimumab group, 20 (3.7%) subjects had late-emergent 
drug-related AEs. 15 (3.5%) of these subjects were intermediate/poor-risk subjects.  
Death as a result of study drug toxicity (as declared by the investigator) occurred in 7 patients (1.3%) 
in the nivolumab + ipilimumab arm versus 4 patients (0.7%) in the sunitinib arm. Deaths attributed to 
“other reasons” occurred in 22 patients in the ipilimumab + nivolumab arm, versus 13 patients in the 
sunitinib arm. This imbalance was driven primairily by a higher frequency of infection-related deaths 
and cardiovascular event-related deaths in the ipilimumab + nivolumab group. 
Drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 21.6% of subjects in the nivolumab + 
ipilimumab group and 11.8% of subjects in the sunitinib group. 
6.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The pivotal study was an open-label study, potentially affecting safety reporting. 
Follow-up was relatively short in relation to establishing the long-term safety of the combination of 
ipilimumab + nivolumab (see RMP).

6.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
6.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In the current pivotal study, nivolumab + ipilimumab showed significantly improved efficacy compared 
to sunitinib in previously untreated intermediate/poor-risk advanced RCC patients. The observed OS 
benefit is considered clinically relevant and unprecedented in this therapeutic context.  
A difference of more than three months was found for the median PFS of nivolumab+ipilimumab 
compared to sunitinib. The K-M curves overlapped the first 6-7 months, then separated and favoured 
nivolumab + ipilimumab. These PFS results further support the observed OS benefit. Also, a convincing 
difference in ORR was observed favouring nivolumab + ipilimumab, including a high proportion of CR 
(9.4%).  
The combination of ipilimumab with nivolumab has a distinct safety profile, characterised by a high 
frequency of immune-mediated adverse events, and is in that respect very different from the safety 
profile of sunitinib. The safety profile of nivolumab + ipilimumab in the current pivotal study is 
consistent with existing data on the safety profile of the combination in melanoma and the observed 
safety profile of sunitinib is also in line with available data, which is reassuring and does not suggest 
bias in safety reporting as a result of the open-label design of the study. When taking into account the 
Assessment report  
EMA/902855/2019  
Page 167/176 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
available safety data on ipilimumab + nivolumab in melanoma, no new safety concerns were identified 
with the combination of nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg in mRCC.  
6.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In the performed pivotal study, a clinically highly relevant OS benefit for nivolumab + ipilimumab 
versus sunitinib was observed in the first-line treatment of intermediate/poor-risk mRCC patients. The 
toxicity of the combination is considered acceptable and the proportion of patients experiencing grade 
3-4 toxicity was lower in the combination group compared to the comparator group. 
Despite the fact that an appropriate phase III three-arm study of nivolumab+ipilimumab v. nivolumab 
v. reference treatment has not been submitted by the applicant, the efficacy of nivolumab in the 
combination can be established on the basis of the overall clinical results and monotherapy data. 
Concerning ipilimumab, although  conclusive clinical trials investigating its activity as monotherapy at 
the proposed dose in RCC are lacking, its use in combination with nivolumab  can be considered 
sufficiently established based on, a cogent biological and pharmacological rationale, as well as relevant 
non-clinical and clinical data such as the activity shown in a B16 tumour mouse model in melanoma, 
evidence of single-agent activity in melanoma, the established contribution of ipilimumab to the 
combination with nivolumab in melanoma, and the consideration that these effects are relevant for 
RCC on the basis of the mechanism of action. 
Therefore, based on the totality of evidence the CHMP concluded that,,  
•  The benefits of the combination treatment were considered to outweigh the risks, including the 
uncertainties regarding the precise contribution of ipilimumab at the studied dose, as the combination 
is associated with clinically important improvement in overall survival compared to sunitinib, with a 
manageable toxicity profile that is not worse than that of the comparator. The comparator is 
considered adequate and there are no treatment options that offer similar advantages without 
additional uncertainty in the target population. 
•  The inference of the contribution of ipilimumab to the benefits of the combination regimen is based 
on the complementary mechanisms of action of the two agents in the combination, the activity shown 
in a B16 tumour mouse model in melanoma, evidence of single-agent activity in melanoma, the 
established contribution of ipilimumab to the combination with nivolumab in melanoma, and the 
consideration that these effects are plausibly relevant for RCC on the basis of the mechanism of action. 
•  Further studies will be conducted to address remaining uncertainties and provide a more precise 
understanding about the contribution of ipilimumab to the combination.  
Taken together, the CHMP considered that there was sufficient evidence that efficacy and safety of 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg have been established and that the remaining 
uncertainties can be accepted as they are outweighed by the large survival benefit observed for the 
combination compared to the current standard. Therefore, the safety, efficacy, and a positive balance 
of benefits and risks of the combination and its components are considered sufficiently established. 
6.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
A major deficiency in the current application is that the precise contribution of ipilimumab (in the 
studied dose) to the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy has not been demonstrated. 
Further data investigating more precisely the contribution of ipilimumab to the combination in first line 
advanced RCC will be submitted post-approval. 
Assessment report  
EMA/902855/2019  
Page 168/176 
 
 
 
The combination of two or more drugs is often an adequate way to achieve or improve efficacy and/or 
improve safety compared to using single agents. This will often be the way forward to advance 
therapies in areas of unmet medical need. In this context, the establishment of adequate combinations 
and doses is crucial, as is outlined in the Guideline on the evaluation of anticancer medicinal products 
in man (EMA/CHMP/205/95 Rev.5). If information on these aspects is inadequate, there is a clear risk 
of exposing patients to combinations that have more toxicity compared to the individual components 
while not being more effective (and potentially even less so).  
The CHMP considered that based on general methodological principles, in order to establish the efficacy 
and safety of each product in this combination, an appropriate phase III design would have been a 
randomised three-arm study of nivolumab+ipilimumab v. nivolumab v. reference treatment. However, 
despite the fact that such study has not been submitted by the applicant, the efficacy of nivolumab in 
the combination can be established on the basis of the overall clinical results and monotherapy data 
available from the literature. Concerning ipilimumab, although conclusive clinical trials investigating its 
activity as monotherapy at the proposed dose in RCC are lacking, the contribution to efficacy can be 
considered sufficiently established based on the overall clinical results, a cogent biological and 
pharmacological rationale, as well as relevant non-clinical and clinical data such as the activity shown 
in a B16 tumour mouse model in melanoma, evidence of single-agent activity in melanoma, the 
established contribution of ipilimumab to the combination with nivolumab in melanoma, and the 
consideration that these effects are relevant for RCC on the basis of the mechanism of action. 
In order to further elucidate the contribution of ipilimumab to the efficacy and toxicity of the 
combination regimen of nivolumab and ipilimumab, the MAH will submit the results of a randomised 
study comparing the efficacy and safety of the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab to nivolumab 
monotherapy in previously untreated adult patients with intermediate/poor-risk advanced renal cell 
carcinoma and with a appropriate spectrum of PD-L1 expression. The Applicant is also recommended 
to provide additional biomarker data that could help identify patients more likely to benefit from the 
combination compared to standard of care. 
6.8.  Conclusions 
The B/R for Opdivo in combination with Yervoy for first-line treatment of adult patients with 
intermediate/poor-risk advanced renal cell carcinoma is positive. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy and safety 
of the combination: 
PAES: In order to further elucidate the contribution of ipilimumab to the efficacy and toxicity of the 
combination regimen of nivolumab and ipilimumab, the MAH should conduct and submit the results of 
a randomised, clinical study comparing the efficacy and safety of the combination of nivolumab and 
ipilimumab to nivolumab monotherapy in previously untreated adult patients with intermediate/poor-
risk advanced renal cell carcinoma and with an appropriate spectrum of PD-L1 expression levels.

specifically: 
  To further investigate the value of biomarkers other than PD-L1 
expression status at tumour cell membrane level by IHC (e.g., other 
methods / assays, and associated cut offs, that might prove more 
sensitive and specific in predicting response to treatment based on PD-L1,

8.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR 
module 8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
Scope 
Extension of indication to include the first-line combination treatment with nivolumab and ipilimumab 
of adult patients with intermediate/poor-risk advanced renal cell carcinoma. As a consequence sections 
4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.6 of the Opdivo and Yervoy SmPCs are updated. The Annex II, the 
Package Leaflet and the Risk Management Plan (version 23.2 for Yervoy and version 13.3 for Opdivo) 
are updated in accordance. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to correct some typos 
throughout the Yervoy and Opdivo product information.

DIVERGENT POSITION DATED 26 JULY 2018 
OPDIVO YERVOY EMEA/H/C/WS1278 
The undersigned members of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s negative opinion 
recommending the refusal of the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation for OPDIVO 
and YERVOY. 
The reason for divergent opinion was the following: 
The B/R in the applied indication is considered positive as a clinically relevant overall survival gain 
has been demonstrated.

DIVERGENT POSITION DATED 15 NOVEMBER 2018 
OPDIVO YERVOY EMEA/H/C/WS1278 
The undersigned members of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion recommending 
the approval of the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation for OPDIVO and YERVOY. 
The reason for divergent opinion was the following: 
The  combination  of  drugs  can  improve  efficacy  compared  to  single  agents.  However,  data  should  be 
available  to  describe  the  contribution  of  the  individual  components,  justifying  their  combination,  to 
avoid  exposing  patients  to  combinations  that  have  more  toxicity  compared  to  the  individual 
components while not necessarily being more effective. 
There is no basis to establish or to quantify any benefits conferred by 1 mg/kg ipilimumab as used in 
combination  with  3  mg/kg  nivolumab  in  the  first-line  treatment  of  intermediate/poor-risk  advanced 
renal  cell  carcinoma  patients,  and  specifically  whether  ipilimumab  contributes  to  the  efficacy  of  the 
combination  therapy  to  an  extent  that  outweighs  the  additional  toxicity  compared  to  nivolumab 
monotherapy.  Therefore,  a  comprehensive  assessment  of  the  benefits  and  risks  associated  with  the 
combination and its components cannot be completed in this case.  
The  benefit-risk  balance  of  the  combination  treatment  with  nivolumab  and  ipilimumab  in  this  setting 
must thus be regarded as unsubstantiated.

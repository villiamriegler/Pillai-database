procedure) 
2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
The sponsor Assign Group Development UK Ltd submitted on 25 September 2015 an application for 
designation as an orphan medicinal product to the European Medicines Agency for a medicinal product 
containing humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody against total complement component 1, 
subcomponent s (C1s) for treatment of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (hereinafter referred to as “the 
condition”). The application was submitted on the basis of Article 3(1)(a) first paragraph of Regulation 
(EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products. 
Having examined the application, the COMP considered that the sponsor has established the following:  
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing humanized IgG4 
monoclonal antibody against total complement component 1, subcomponent s was considered 
justified based on clinical data demonstrating decreased hemolysis and increased hemoglobin 
levels;  
the condition is chronically debilitating due to venous or arterial thrombotic events, infectious 
complications, requirement of red blood cell transfusion and decreased quality of life;  
the condition was estimated to be affecting less than 2.3 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, 
at the time the application was made.  
Thus, the requirements under Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products are fulfilled. 
In addition, although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorized in the 
European Union, the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal 
product containing humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody against total complement component 1, 
subcomponent s will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. The sponsor has 
provided pre-clinical in vitro and early clinical data from persons affected by cold autoimmune 
hemolytic anemia that demonstrate that the product inhibits hemolysis and improves hemoglobin 
levels. The immediate effect of the treatment compares favorably to the authorized treatments and 
methods such as corticosteroids or splenectomy. The use of the product may also have a more long-
lived effect compared to red blood cell transfusion. The Committee considered that this constitutes a 
clinically relevant advantage.

3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) is a rare acquired autoimmune disorder in which various 
types of autoantibodies directed against red blood cells (RBC) membrane antigens lead to their 
accelerated destruction. There are two main types of autoimmune haemolytic anaemia: warm 
autoimmune haemolytic anaemia and cold autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (also known as Cold 
Agglutinin Disease). This classification depends on the type of antibodies involved in the disease. The 
most common type of AIHA, warm autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, involves IgG antibodies, which 
bind red blood cells at normal body temperature. Cold autoimmune haemolytic anaemia on the other 
hand only accounts for about 15% to 30% of AIHA cases (Berentsen S. 2021) and involve IgM 
autoantibodies that bind red blood cells at cooler temperatures compared to a body’s usual core 
temperature. There’s a wide variation in the temperature threshold at which a cold autoantibody will 
bind to red blood cells.  
The target population for Enjaymo is patients with Cold Agglutinin Disease (CAD). Cold Agglutinin 
Disease is subdivided into “primary,” now referred to simply as CAD (cold agglutinin disease), versus 
“secondary,” now termed cold agglutinin syndrome (CAS).  Patients with CAS have an associated 
condition, for example infection, autoimmune disorder, overt evidence of a B-cell lymphoma, or other 
malignancy. In contrast, patients with CAD may have a B-cell clonal lymphoproliferative disorder 
detectable in blood or marrow but no clinical or radiological evidence of malignancy (Berentsen S. 
2021). 
The approved therapeutic indication “Enjaymo is indicated for the treatment of haemolytic anaemia in 
adult patients with cold agglutinin disease (CAD)” falls within the scope of the designated orphan 
condition “Treatment of autoimmune haemolytic anaemia”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
There have been no changes in the chronically debilitating aspects of the condition since the 
designation. 
Although many medical textbooks still continue to refer to AIHA, in particular cold autoimmune 
haemolytic anaemia, as a mild disease typically able to be managed with non-specific, supportive 
measures, experts in haematology have called attention to the wide spectrum of severity of the clinical 
phenotype and the substantial number of patients for whom it is serious and/or life-threatening 
(Swiecicki 2013, Barcellinin W 2014, Röth A 2022, Broome CM 2020). 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report 
EMA/OD/0000082097 
Page 5/9 
 
 
  
 
 
 
The sponsor concludes that CAD is a serious and chronically debilitating condition due to decreased 
quality of life and haemolytic anaemia that may require red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, with an 
increased risk of venous or arterial thrombotic events. 
The condition is considered to be chronically debilitating due to venous or arterial thrombotic events, 
infectious complications, requirement of RBC transfusion and decreased quality of life.   
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor bases the prevalence estimate on an article by Hansen et al from 2020 in which AIHA 
patients from the Danish National Patient Register were reviewed. Prevalence estimates within this 
publication mainly reflects data from patients with an acquired haemolytic disorder diagnosis in 1977–
2015/2016. The most recent reported overall prevalence estimated for AIHA patients in Denmark in 
2015 is 1.7 per 10,000 persons. The figure is higher in patients over 50 (2.6 per 10,000) and also 
seem to be slightly more prevalent in women than men according to this article. See part of table 3 
from the article: 
The proposed prevalence is lower than at the designation time in 2016. At the time the proposed 
prevalence was also 1.7 in 10,00 but a hypothetical “worst-case” estimate of the prevalence of AIHA 
was also presented by the sponsor. This was based on a mean incidence of 0.1 in 10,000, derived from 
the publications at the time and assumed that each acute, incident case of AIHA becomes a chronic, 
prevalent case (i.e., no remissions, no cures, and no fatalities occur) and a duration of the disease of 
23 years: 0.1/10,000 X 23 = 2.3/10,000. If the same calculation would be done today with the 
incidence of 1.77 in 100,000 (Hansen 2020) the figure would be 4.1 in 10,000. However, it seems 
reasonable to base the estimate on the figures available and not a worst-case scenario. 
It might be prudent to use the figure of 2.6 in 10,000 which is reported for patients above 50. The 
reasons are that the incidence rate and prevalence proportion increased over the study periods 
(Hansen et al) in all age groups and for both sexes (which can be due to better reporting). Therefore, 
the COMP could accept a prevalence of 2.6 in 10,000. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition.

Existing methods 
The sponsor has summarised the current options for treating AIHA including supportive measures like 
transfusions and plasma exchange. Splenectomy is among third line therapeutic options for warm 
AIHA. However, in CAD splenectomy is not effective as the sensitized red blood cells are mainly 
removed in the liver (S Berentsen, 2006). 
Corticosteroids are registered in EU for the treatment of “acquired (autoimmune) haemolytic anaemia” 
and they remain first-line therapy for warm-AIHA (Jäger 2020). For patients with CAD, corticosteroids 
are typically ineffective (S Berentsen 2011 and 2006, Swiecicki PL 2013) or very high doses are 
needed in order to maintain the remission, therefore corticosteroids are not considered a satisfactory 
method for the target patient population for Enjaymo.   
Treatment options are generally determined by guidelines for treatment (Jäger 2020). The therapeutic 
algorithm for cold agglutinin disease is shown below in Figure 3.  
Figure 3.  Therapeutic algorithm for cold agglutinin disease (from Jäger et al., Diagnosis and 
treatment of autoimmune hemolytic anemia in adults: Recommendations from the First International 
Consensus Meeting, Blood Reviews 41 (2020) 100648) 
* W & W, watch and wait 
In symptomatic patients (non-emergency treatment situation), the recommended first-line therapy is 
rituximab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 antigen expressed on B-lymphocytes. 
Support for its use in warm and cold antibody AIHA comes from several studies and was also 
summarized in a meta-analysis in 2015 by Reynaud et al 2015.  
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report 
EMA/OD/0000082097 
Page 7/9 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
The Complete Response Rate to rituximab was estimated as 21% (95% CI 6–51%) for cold 
autoimmune hemolytic anemia in 118 patients taken from 7 studies (Birgens H 2013). However, 
Rituximab is not specifically authorized for AIHA and neither are the five market complement inhibitors 
(Soliris®, Berinert®, Cetor®, Cinzyre®, Ruconest®) even though Soliris®/Eculizumab is recommended in 
emergency situations in the treatment guideline by Jäger et al 2020.   
It is also recognized that clinical trial participation is a valid first-line option for symptomatic CAD 
patients.  
Azathioprine is authorized in many EU countries for AIHA or AIHA caused by warm IgG antibodies. The 
sponsor gives the examples of: 
•  Azathioprin Heumann 25 mg &75 mg film coated tablets (AT/H/0270/001-002) registered since 
28.07.2010 in Austria, Estonia, Belgium, Germany, and Sweden targeting AIHA 
•  Azatioprin "Mylan"(DK/H/0146/001) registered since 1999 in Denmark, Ireland and The 
Netherands targeting refractory warm AIHA 
• 
Jayempi® (azathioprine) 10 mg/ml oral suspension (EMEA/H/C/005055) obtained its marketing 
authorisation on 21/06/2021 with an indication limited to refractory auto-immune hemolytic 
anemia, caused by warm IgG antibodies 
The mechanisms whereby azathioprine affects autoimmune diseases are not known. The use of 
azathioprine for treatment of AIHA (specifically: warm AIHA) as it appears in expert recommendations 
for third-line therapy and, for the therapeutic indication listed in the SPC for azathioprine in some 
countries, rests upon a very limited foundation of clinical data (Jäger 2020).  According to the 
sponsor’s review, there are no controlled clinical trials of azathioprine in AIHA recorded in the clinical 
trial registers of FDA, EMA, and WHO or reported in PubMed. According to the recommendations from 
the First International Consensus Meeting 2020, treatment options such as those used in warm AIHA 
(corticosteroids, azathioprine or cyclophosphamide) are not effective in CAD and should not be used 
(Jäger 2020). Moreover, azathioprine is an immunosuppressive antimetabolite (Jayempi SmPC). 
Patients receiving immunosuppressants, such as azathioprine, are at increased risk of developing 
lymphoma and other malignancies, particularly of the skin. Physicians using azathioprine should be 
very familiar with this risk as well as with the mutagenic potential to both men and women and with 
possible hematologic toxicities (Berentsen S 2011). Due to the documented lack of effect in CAD, it can 
be considered that azathioprine is not a satisfactory method for treating patients with CAD. 
The COMP concluded that there are no satisfactory methods of treatment for patients with CAD. 
Significant benefit 
Not applicable as there are no specific products for patients with CAD.

5.  COMP position adopted on 16 September 2022 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was 
estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be 2.6 in 10,000 persons in the 
European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to venous or arterial thrombotic events, infections, 
requirement of red blood cell transfusion and decreased quality of life; 
there is, at present, no satisfactory method for the treatment of the entirety of patients covered by 
the therapeutic indication of Enjaymo. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Enjaymo, humanised IgG4 
monoclonal antibody against total complement component 1, subcomponent s  for treatment of 
autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (EU/3/16/1609) is not removed from the Community Register of 
Orphan Medicinal Products.

Executive Summary 
Tumour Necrosis-Factor-alpha (TNFα) inhibition is an important treatment option for several chronic 
inflammatory autoimmune disorders in rheumatology and gastroenterology. TNFα is a multipotent 
cytokine that occurs in monomeric and trimeric soluble and transmembrane forms. It exhibits a wide 
spectrum of activity, including coordinating host immune and inflammatory response to infectious, 
malignant and autoimmune conditions. TNFα exerts its biological functions by binding to the TNF 
receptor, of which two types have been identified: TNF-R1 and TNF-R2. TNF-R1 is expressed in most 
tissues and can be fully activated by both the membrane-bound and soluble trimeric forms of TNF, 
whereas TNF-R2 is found only in cells of the immune system. 
Infliximab is a chimeric human-murine monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to both soluble 
and transmembrane forms of TNFα. TNFα receptor activation is prevented by infliximab through binding 
to TNFα, thereby neutralizing the biological activity of TNFα. This monoclonal antibody was first 
authorised in the EU in August 1999 under the invented name of Remicade. It is currently approved for 
the following indications: rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, adult 
and paediatric Crohn’s disease and adult and paediatric ulcerative colitis.  
In June 2013, the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
recommended the authorisation of Inflectra as a biosimilar medicinal product containing infliximab. This 
is the first time that such recommendation is given in the European Union for a biosimilar monoclonal 
antibody. The therapeutic indications as well as the dosing regimen are the same as those of Remicade; 
the pharmaceutical form (powder for concentrate for solution for infusion) and strength (100 mg 
infliximab per vial) are also the same.  
In order to support this authorisation, the results of an extensive comparability exercise between the two 
products were presented. Demonstration of comparability via a thorough development programme 
included quality, nonclinical and clinical data and is key to the evaluation of a biosimilar medicinal 
product.  
As part of the comparability exercise it was shown that all major physicochemical characteristics and 
biological activities of Inflectra were comparable to those of Remicade. The CHMP noted a small difference 
in the amount of afucosylated infliximab, translating into a lower binding affinity towards specific Fc 
receptors and a lower ex vivo antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity in the most 
sensitive ADCC assay. This difference was, however, not considered clinically meaningful, as it did not 
affect the activities of Inflectra in experimental models regarded as more relevant to the 
pathophysiological conditions in patients.  
The clinical data demonstrating similarity between Inflectra and Remicade consisted of two main clinical 
trials: a pivotal pharmacokinetic study in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) (Study CT-P13 1.1) 
and a pivotal efficacy and safety study in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (Study CT-P13 
3.1). The pharmacokinetic trial in AS patients showed, at the dose of 5 mg/kg, comparable profiles 
between Inflectra and Remicade at steady state (after 5 doses) with the 90% confidence intervals of the 
geometric means ratios (%) of both primary parameters Cmax,ss and AUCτ contained within the 
pre-specified bioequivalence interval: AUCτ:104.10 (93.93-115.36) and Cmax,ss: 101.47 (94.57-108.86). 
In addition, the results of the main secondary pharmacokinetic parameters such as Tmax, Cmin,ss, T½, CLss, 
Vss between Weeks 22 and 30, as well as Cmax and Cmin after the 9 treatment doses were also comparable 
in the Inflectra and Remicade treatment arms, providing further evidence of a similar PK behaviour. 
Additional supportive data regarding the similarity at the dose of 3 mg/kg were provided from the second 
main study. The efficacy and safety trial in RA patients achieved its primary endpoint since the 95% 
confidence interval for the difference in the ACR20 response rate at Week 30 was contained within the 
Inflectra

predefined equivalence margin (± 15%) in both the all-randomised (95% CI: -0.06, 0.10) and Per 
Protocol populations (95% CI: -0.04, 0.12). At week 30, the results of the secondary endpoints (in 
particular ACR50 and ACR70, decreases in DAS28, SDAI and CDAI, increases in SF-36) were all consistent 
with the results of the primary endpoint. These data were further supported by comparable response 
rates at Week 54. Additional supportive efficacy data were provided in another indication by the PK study 
CT-P13 1.1 conducted in AS patients. The efficacy results were comparable between treatment arms up 
to Week 54. 
The evaluation of the safety profile of the biosimilar medicinal product was supported mainly by the 
results from the two clinical studies mentioned above. The type and incidence of adverse drug reactions 
observed with Inflectra and Remicade in the respective studies were generally similar and no new safety 
concern was identified. There were no marked differences in the immunogenicity profile of the two 
products up to 54 weeks and the impact of antibodies on efficacy and safety was comparable. A numerical 
imbalance in serious adverse events was observed in the study CT-P13 3.1 with a higher number of 
serious infections, including active tuberculosis. However, the numbers were low and the CHMP, based on 
a thorough review of all available evidence, was of the opinion that the observed difference was most 
likely a chance finding. It was also noted that there is no plausible explanation from a mechanistic point 
of view for a difference in host defence. Serious infections, including tuberculosis will be closely monitored 
on a longer term and in larger cohorts of patients as part of the post-marketing setting through several 
registries conducted in different patient populations as described in the risk management plan, such as 
the British Society For Rheumatology Biologics Register – Rheumatoid Arthritis (BSRBR-RA), the 
Rheumatoid Arthritis Observation of Biologic Therapy (RABBIT) and other Applicant’s sponsored 
registries. Rare adverse events known to Remicade, such as malignancies and lymphoproliferative 
disorders will also be closely monitored as part of these registries.  
Based on the robust comparisons of the physicochemical and in vitro and ex vivo biological analyses, 
Inflectra was considered biosimilar to the reference product Remicade. These data, in combination with 
clinical data demonstrating pharmacokinetic and therapeutic equivalence in rheumatology conditions, 
allow for extrapolation to all other indications of Remicade. In addition, the Applicant will conduct a 
randomised, double-blind, parallel-group comparative study between Inflectra and Remicade in patients 
with active Crohn’s disease.  
The CHMP concluded that the benefit/risk balance of Inflectra as a biosimilar product to Remicade is 
positive. Several post-authorisation studies and registries, as detailed in the risk management plan, will 
provide further long-term efficacy data, including in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases, and 
further characterise the long-term safety profile of Inflectra.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Tumour necrosis-factor-alpha (TNFα) is a multipotent cytokine that occurs in monomeric and trimeric 
soluble and transmembrane forms. It is mainly produced by macrophages, as well as by a broad variety 
of other cell types including lymphoid cells, mast cells, endothelial cells, cardiac myocytes, adipose tissue, 
fibroblasts and neural tissue. TNFα exhibits a wide spectrum of activity, including coordinating host 
immune and inflammatory response to infectious, malignant and autoimmune conditions. Large amounts 
of TNFα have been shown to be released in response to liposaccharide, other bacterial components and 
interleukin-1 (IL-1). Whereas initial TNFα expression in response to infection or injury is beneficial, 
sustained or excessive expression has been identified in several chronic inflammatory autoimmune 
disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriasis (Ps), psoriatic arthritis 
(PsA), Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). 
TNFα causes its biological effects by binding to the TNF receptor, of which two types have been identified: 
a 55 kDa protein (p55, TNF-R1) and a 75 kDa protein (p75, TNF-R2). TNF-R1 is expressed in most tissues 
and can be fully activated by both the membrane-bound and soluble trimeric forms of TNF, whereas 
TNF-R2 is found only in cells of the immune system. 
Infliximab is a chimeric human-murine monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to both soluble 
and transmembrane forms of TNFα. Infliximab prevents TNFα receptor activation by binding to TNFα, 
thereby neutralizing the biological activity of TNFα. Infliximab was first authorised in the EU on 13 August 
1999 under the name of Remicade. It is currently approved for the following indications: RA, AS, Ps, PsA, 
CD and UC. In this similar biological application the Applicant applied for all approved Remicade 
indications. 
About the Product 
Inflectra (also referred to as CT-P13 in the report) contains the active substance infliximab and has been 
developed as a similar biological medicinal product to the reference medicinal product Remicade. The 
formulation development process for Inflectra has been designed to replicate Remicade and both 
products are identical with respect to the pharmaceutical form, strength, composition and route of 
administration. Inflectra drug product is a powder for concentrate for solution for infusion supplied at 100 
mg infliximab per vial and contains the same excipients as Remicade. The powder has to be reconstituted 
with 10 mL of sterile water for injections resulting in a pH of approximately 7.2. The total volume of the 
Inflectra  
Assessment report

Page 13/105 
 
  
reconstituted solution should then be diluted to 250 ml with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for 
infusion. The product is administered as an intravenous infusion, usually over a 2-hour period. Depending 
on the indication, a loading dose regimen of 3 or 5 mg/kg at 0, 2 and 6 weeks may be followed by a 
maintenance dose regimen of the same dose every 6 or 8 weeks. The proposed therapeutic indications 
and posology for CT-P13 are identical to those for Remicade, to which similarity is claimed. 
Type of application and aspects on development 
The application is submitted under the Centralised procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 1 of 
Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, biotech medicinal product. This application is submitted in 
accordance with the following article in directive 2001/83/EC:  Article 10(4): Similar biological 
application. The European reference medicinal product is Remicade (infliximab) 100 mg powder for 
concentrate for solution for infusion, MA numbers EU/1/99/116/001-005, MA holder Janssen Biologics 
B.V., authorised 13 August 1999. 
An extensive comparability exercise is required to demonstrate that the similar biological product and the 
reference medicinal product already authorised in the Union have similar profiles in terms of quality, 
safety and efficacy. The evaluation of this clinical development programme of CT-P13 has specifically to 
consider the EU guidelines for similar biological medicinal products and also indication-specific guidelines 
(see list below).

During the development of CT-P13 the Applicant sought scientific and procedural advice from the CHMP. 
The scientific advice procedures covered questions on the pharmaceutical quality, the non-clinical and 
clinical programme. The scientific advice received by the CHMP was generally taken into consideration 
and any deviation was discussed by the Applicant. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Inflectra (also referred to as CT-P13) contains the active substance infliximab, which is a chimeric 
human-murine IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to both soluble and 
Inflectra  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589422/2013 
Page 14/105 
 
  
 
transmembrane (tm) forms of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). Infliximab prevents TNFα receptor 
activation by binding to TNFα, thereby neutralising the biological activity of TNFα. 
CT-P13 has been developed as a similar biological medicinal product to the reference medicinal product 
(RMP) Remicade (infliximab). The formulation development process for Inflectra has been designed to 
replicate the RMP Remicade and both medicinal products are identical with respect to strength, 
pharmaceutical form, route of administration, composition in excipients. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Like other IgG subclasses, CT-P13 is a glycoprotein with one N-linked glycosylation site (Asn 300) in the 
CH2 domain of each heavy chain. The detected oligosaccharides are mostly G0F (absence of terminal 
galactose) and G1F (one terminal galactose) structures. Each heavy chain consists of 450 amino acids 
with 11 cysteine residues, and each light chain consists of 214 amino acids with 5 cysteine residues. All 
cysteines in heavy and light chain are involved in either intra- or inter-disulphide bonding. 
Manufacture 
The active substance is manufactured at Celltrion Inc, 13-6 Songdo-dong, Yeonsu-gu, Incheon, 406-840, 
Republic of Korea. 
Development genetics 
The Sp2/0-Ag14 cell line was formed by fusing BALB/c spleen cells (from mouse immunised with sheep 
red blood cells) with the P3X63Ag8 myeloma. Generation of the CT-P13 cell substrate was accomplished 
using standard cell line transfection and methotrexate amplification protocols for the expression vector. 
The vector encodes both the heavy and light chains and the dihydrofolate reductase expression system. 
Cell banking system 
A two-tiered cell banking system of Master Cell Bank (MCB) and Working Cell Bank (WCB) was developed 
from a pre-MCB and maintained in accordance to current Good Manufacturing Practices and ICH 
guidelines. An end-of-production cells bank (EPCB) derived from the WCB was also generated with cells 
used for commercial production of CT-P13. 
Procedures followed for the preparation of the MCB, WCB and EPCB were described. An extensive range 
of tests was performed for their characterisation, in accordance to ICH guidelines, including identity, 
viability, stability, presence of adventitious agents. 
Fermentation process 
The CT-P13 manufacturing process is initiated using a single vial of the WCB. The cells are expanded to 
sufficient numbers to seed the production bioreactor. After fixed production duration, the cell culture 
media is harvested and filtered. The harvested cell culture fluid (HCCF) is then stored until initiation of 
downstream operations. 
Each of the cell expansion steps has been described in sufficient detail. Critical process parameters are 
justified and appropriate in-process controls are specified for the cell culture steps, including viable cell 
density and cell viability. In-process control tests are sufficient to ensure the microbial safety of the 
product and consistent quality. 
Purification process 
CT-P13 is purified through a series of chromatographic steps, viral inactivation and nanofiltration steps 
and ultrafiltration/diafiltration step. 
Inflectra  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589422/2013 
Page 15/105 
 
  
 
 
Each step of the purification process has been adequately described, including descriptions of the 
different buffers used, column regeneration and storage conditions.  Process hold steps are detailed and 
appropriate data to support product intermediate hold times has been provided. The critical process 
parameters for each process step are justified and appropriate in-process controls, with justified 
acceptance limits, are specified. In-process control tests are sufficient to ensure the microbial/viral safety 
of the product, and consistent quality. 
Process validation and/or evaluation 
Extensive process validation was undertaken for the CT-P13 active substance manufacturing process at 
Celltrion, Korea.  
The validation for the upstream process included several production bioreactors. Evaluation at 
commercial scale included a bioreactor agitation study and harvest optimisation study. 
The downstream process was validated using full scale harvest batches. A qualified scale-down model 
for the purification process was used to evaluate virus clearance and removal of impurities (host cell 
proteins (HCP), DNA, leached Protein A and media components) via impurity spiking studies. The 
validation strategy included demonstration of adequate column cleaning and lack of cross contamination 
between purification runs. In addition, the hold times for media and buffers used during production were 
evaluated, along with product intermediate hold steps during production. Reprocessing validation, 
shipping validation and results from a freeze-thaw study were also covered.  
Manufacturing process development 
During process development, several changes were made to the manufacturing process to improve 
product and process consistency. Appropriate product comparability studies have been carried out to 
demonstrate that the process changes have not impacted on key product quality attributes. 
All the changes to the CT-P13 active substance manufacturing process were implemented after 
production of the batches used in pivotal non-clinical and Phase I/III clinical studies.  
Characterisation 
An extensive product characterisation exercise was conducted, using a range of state-of-the-art 
orthogonal methodologies in order to elucidate the primary, secondary and higher order structure, 
post-translational modifications and associated micro-heterogeneity, glycosylation, charged isoforms, 
purity and biological activity associated with CT-P13.  
Given that CT-P13 was developed as a similar biological medicinal product, an extensive comparability 
alongside the RMP, Remicade, was undertaken. Data and discussion pertaining to comparability with the 
RMP are located in section 2.2.4. 
A) Elucidation of structure and other characteristics 
A1) Physicochemical characterisation 
A range of techniques has been employed in order to elucidate the primary structure of CT-P13, these 
include:  
-  Amino acid analysis: content analysed by acid hydrolysis, derivatisation, reversed phase high 
performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and fluorescence detection. 
- 
Peptide mapping: active substance and finished product were analysed by liquid chromatography 
mass spectrometry (LC-MS) peptide mapping. 
-  Analysis of post-translational modifications. 
Inflectra  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589422/2013 
Page 16/105 
 
  
 
 
-  N-terminal and C-terminal sequencing by peptide mapping in combination with tandem mass 
spectrometry (MS/MS). 
-  Heavy and light chain mass was determined by liquid chromatography electrospray ionisation mass 
spectrometry (LC-ES-MS)  
The elucidation of higher order structures included the following assessments: 
-  Determination of disulphide bond location by native and reduced peptide mapping. 
-  Determination of the amount of free sulfhydryl groups using Ellman’s reagent.  
-  Secondary structure analysis using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and circular 
dichroism (far UV). 
- 
Tertiary structure analysis using circular dichroism (near UV). 
-  Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to assess the thermal stability and general higher order 
structure of CT-P13. 
In relation to purity/impurity: 
-  Aggregate content and monomeric purity was determined by size exclusion chromatography 
(SEC-HPLC) under non-denaturing conditions. 
-  Determination of electrophoretic mobility and purity was performed using capillary electrophoresis 
sodium dodecyl sulphate (CE-SDS). Non-reducing conditions were used for determination of levels 
of intact IgG (H2L2) and any detectable non-assembled antibody species. Reducing CE-SDS was 
performed for determination of purity.  
- 
In order to characterise the CT-P13 IgG fragments, CT-P13 finished product was assessed by 
means of SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The bands identified were excised 
and subject to LC-MS analysis. 
There are a number of post-translational modifications that have the potential to influence CT-P13 
charge heterogeneity, notably C-terminal lysine variability, product deamidation, product oxidation and 
glycosylation. The CT-P13 charged variants were analysed using isoelectric focusing (IEF), ion exchange 
chromatography (IEC-HPLC) combined with tryptic peptide mapping (charge isoform distribution) as 
well as LC-MS peptide mapping (oxidised molecular variants).  
Glycosylation: 
In order to fully elucidate the sites of glycosylation, as well as the glycan micro-heterogeneity associated 
with the molecule, a range of state-of-the-art methodologies has been employed, including site-specific 
glycosylation analysis (LC-MS peptide analysis and oligosaccharide profiling) to determine the range of 
glycan structures displayed by CT-P13 at Asn300. In addition to this, monosaccharide analysis of neutral 
and amino sugars has been undertaken and the type/amount of sialic acids capping the glycan 
structures has been assessed. 
- N-linked glycan analysis: LC-MS analysis of the peptides generated during peptide mapping was used 
for determination of oligosaccharide structures, attachment sites and distribution. Selected ion 
chromatograms were used to quantify each oligosaccharide species. The data confirmed Asn300 as the 
only site of N-glycosylation. As expected for an IgG1 monoclonal antibody, no O-linked glycans were 
detected. 
- Oligosaccharide profiling: to further characterise the glycan micro-heterogeneity associated with this 
single N-glycosylation site, high-performance anion exchange chromatography coupled with pulsed 
Inflectra  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589422/2013 
Page 17/105 
 
  
 
amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) was used to resolve and reveal the oligosaccharide structures. 
The identified structures, G0F, Man5, G1F and G2F are in agreement with the typical oligosaccharide 
profile of a monoclonal antibody.  
- Monosaccharide analysis: determination and quantitation of neutral and amino sugar composition was 
performed by acid hydrolysis followed by chromatography to separate the monosaccharides.  
- Sialic acids were analysed by HPAEC-PAD analysis. Sialic acid was detected in the form of 
N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NeuGc) in all samples, with no other forms detected. 
A2) Biological characterisation 
The biological activity of infliximab can be categorised into two parts. The primary mechanism of action 
involves the TNFα neutralisation by binding to TNFα and inhibition of cell signalling for proliferation. 
Assays for this include in vitro TNFα neutralisation activity, apoptosis, TNFα binding affinity by Surface 
Plasmon Resonance (SPR) and ELISA, and cell-based TNFα binding affinity assay. The secondary 
mechanism of action involves the activation of the immune responses which includes 
antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), FcγR family 
binding affinity (SPR), FcRn binding affinity (SPR) and C1q binding affinity (ELISA). 
B) Variants and impurities 
B1) Product-related variants and impurities 
- Charged isoforms as determined by IEC-HPLC: the biological activity of all IEC-HPLC peaks was subject 
to analysis with respect to in vitro TNFα neutralisation activity, TNFα binding affinity by ELISA, C1q 
binding affinity by ELISA, FcγRIIIa binding affinity by SPR and FcRn binding affinity by SPR. The data 
show that all IEC-HPLC peaks are biologically active. 
-  Oxidised  variants  as  determined  by  LC-MS  peptide  mapping:  low  levels  were  detected  in  active 
substance and finished product batches. It is considered that these variants have no deleterious effect 
on the efficacy of the product. 
- IgG fragments as determined by CE-SDS (non-reduced and reduced): IgG fragment was investigated 
for TNFα binding affinity (ELISA) and in vitro TNFα neutralisation activity. 
- Glycan variants as determined by CE-SDS, peptide mapping LC-MS and HPAEC-PAD: a study was 
performed to investigate the correlation between glycosylation and Fc function of CT-P13. The presence 
of Fc glycans influences the binding of IgG to Fc receptors and C1q; in the case of CT-P13, such binding 
is associated with ADCC and CDC activity, which are secondary mechanisms of action associated with 
infliximab. This binding ability is affected by Fc glycan variability; therefore the FcγRIIIa and C1q binding 
affinities were studied using SPR and ELISA methods, respectively, in order to determine the correlation 
between glycosylation and bioactivity. In particular, the influence of glycan moieties on the Fc domain of 
IgG bioactivity (FcγRIIIa binding affinity and C1q binding affinity) was studied. The correlation between 
glycosylation and biological activity was assessed through the modulation of aglycosylation and 
agalactosylation. The impact of aglycosylation on bioactivity in terms of FcγRIIIa and C1q binding 
affinity is substantial. Nevertheless, the amount of aglycosylated protein was below the limit of 
quantitation for all CT-P13 active substance and finished product samples tested to date, therefore the 
findings of this aglycosylation study do not hold implications for the efficacy of the CT-P13 finished 
product. The data also indicate that galactosylation does not influence bioactivity in terms of FcγRIIIa 
and C1q binding. 
- High-molecular weight species as determined by SEC-HPLC: forced degradation data demonstrate that 
low pH and high temperature result in product aggregation and that the vast majority of product 
aggregate results from non-covalent forces. The study also showed a correlation between CT-P13 
Inflectra  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589422/2013 
Page 18/105 
 
  
product aggregation and decreased biological activity, as determined by TNFα neutralisation.  
B2) Process-related impurities 
The process-related impurities associated with CT-P13 include HCP, host cell DNA, rProtein A and media 
components. Other potential contaminants include bioburden and endotoxins.  
Specifications 
Batch release results from full-scale batches were presented in the dossier. The results were consistent 
and within the defined acceptance criteria in place at the time of manufacture. The commercial release 
specifications have been defined on the basis of process capability and product quality. 
The  control  tests  proposed  for  the  active  substance  are  considered  appropriate  to  ensure  sufficient 
quality with respect to identity, purity/impurities, quantity, potency and safety (microbial). 
All methods have been satisfactorily validated with regard to specificity, accuracy, precision, linearity, 
and robustness. 
Stability 
The design of the stability program, including the testing intervals and temperature storage conditions, 
are in accordance to current guidelines. The tests chosen are a subset of tests from the release 
specifications selected for stability-indicating properties. 
The stability data provided support a 36 month shelf-life for the active substance stored at -40±5°C and 
a 6 month shelf-life when stored at 5±3°C. 
In accordance to EU GMP guidelines, any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative 
trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The CT-P13 finished product is formulated as a white lyophilised powder in a 20 mL Type I borosilicate 
glass vial with a 20 mm, double vent butyl rubber stopper and a 20 mm aluminium flip-off seal. All 
components are in compliance with the European Pharmacopoeia. 
The finished product is composed of 100 mg CT-P13 active substance, sodium dihydrogen phosphate 
monohydrate, di-sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate, sucrose and polysorbate 80 as excipients. All 
excipients are of pharmacopoeial grade. 
Since the CT-P13 formulation was set identical to that of Remicade, only limited qualitative and 
quantitative formulation studies have been performed, the purpose of which was to demonstrate the 
formulation used was adequately robust in terms of product stability and quality and comparable with the 
RMP. 
No overfill is used in CT-P13 finished product manufacture.  
The lyophilisate is reconstituted with 10 mL of sterile water for injections to yield a single dose formulation 
of 10 mg/mL infliximab, at pH 7.2. Each vial is designed to deliver a single dose of 100 mg CT-P13 active 
substance. 
During product development, a total of three finished product manufacturing sites have been used; one 
site was used for supply of material used in initial non-clinical studies, and two manufacturing sites have 
Inflectra  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589422/2013 
Page 19/105 
 
  
 
 
 
 
been used for supply of clinical material and licensed for commercial supply. However, the manufacturing 
process for the finished product has not significantly changed as a result of the change in manufacturers, 
although the scale of finished product manufacture is different at the two sites that will be used for 
commercial supply. Nonetheless an extensive comparability study has been undertaken which 
demonstrated that there were no significant differences in the quality of finished product manufactured at 
these three sites. 
Adventitious agents 
The non-viral and viral adventitious agents safety evaluation is discussed in section 2.2.4. 
Manufacture of the product 
The finished product manufacturing process comprises an initial dilution of bulk active substance 
followed by terminal sterile filtration prior to filling and lyophilisation. Finally, the vials are stoppered, 
sealed and capped, 100% inspected then labelled and packaged into the secondary containers. 
The manufacturing process at both sites that will be used for commercial supply has been fully validated 
at their respective commercial scales of manufacture. The validation studies covered preparation of 
formulation buffer, final formulation (dilution) of the bulk active substance, sterile filtration, 
demonstration of aseptic processing via media fill studies, the lyophilisation process and finally 
stoppering, capping and crimping. In addition, hold times of buffers and product intermediates were 
validated. The results demonstrated that the manufacturing process at both sites is robust and 
consistently yields product capable of meeting pre-defined quality characteristics.  
Product specification 
Batch release results from full scale batches were presented in the dossier. The results were consistent 
and within the defined acceptance criteria in place at the time of manufacture. The commercial release 
specifications for the finished product have been defined on the basis of process capability and product 
quality. 
The  control  tests  proposed  for  the  finished  product  are  considered  appropriate  to  ensure  sufficient 
quality with respect to identity, purity/impurities, quantity, potency and safety (microbial), as well as 
pharmacopoeial tests required specifically for parenteral products to be administered by infusion. 
All methods have been satisfactorily validated with regard to specificity, accuracy, precision, linearity, 
and robustness. 
Stability of the product 
Real-time and accelerated stability studies were initiated in accordance to ICH guidelines and per 
protocol to monitor the time-temperature stability of cGMP lots of finished product. On the basis of the 
data provided, the approvable shelf-life for the finished product is 36 months at 5 ± 3°C. In terms of 
in-use shelf-life, the available data show that the reconstituted finished product is stable for up to 48 
hours when stored at 5 ± 3°C or 30 ± 2°C/65 ± 5% RH. If not used immediately, in-use storage times 
and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and should not be longer than 24 hours at 
2 to 8°C. 
In accordance to EU GMP guidelines, any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative 
trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA. 
Comparability Exercise for Finished Medicinal Product  
A comprehensive and state-of-the art comparability exercise was performed for the proposed CT-P13 
Inflectra

biosimilar product with the RMP Remicade. The Applicant has used multiple batches of CT-P13 finished 
product and Remicade for each analysis. All batches of Remicade were sourced in the EU. In many of the 
analytical evaluations, CT-P13 active substance was also used; this has a similar formulation (in liquid 
form) to the finished product. Infliximab was not extracted from the RMP since the formulation does not 
interfere with the analytical methods used. 
An overview of the program of comparability testing that has been undertaken is provided in Table 1 and 
Table 2. Comparability with the RMP is discussed in section 2.2.4.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
•  Active substance 
The CT-P13 active substance manufacturing process is controlled by process parameters (input 
variables) as well as by in-process tests (output variables). Based on their influence on the identified 
CQAs, the process parameters have been divided into critical (CPPs) and non-critical (non-CPPs). The 
establishment of the CQAs and the risk assessment to support the assignment of criticality to process 
Inflectra

parameters were described. Further information and improvements were provided in order to achieve a 
satisfactorily controlled active substance manufacturing process. The proposed CPP acceptance 
limits/ranges have been updated based on historical batch data and characterisation and are acceptable. 
The control of the active substance manufacturing process was considered acceptable, following a 
request by the CHMP for clarification of the strategy. 
The Applicant has described the generation of the cell line, including details of the plasmid, manufacture 
of the transfected cells and selection of the production clone. Extensive testing and characterisation 
were performed on the MCB, which is satisfactory. Less characterisation has been performed for the 
current WCB, which is acceptable. Details for establishing future WCBs have also been provided. 
Cells at the limit of in vitro cell age were characterised from the EPCB and acceptable testing results for 
the EPCB are provided. Retrovirus particles have been identified, as expected for this cell line. Genetic 
stability testing for the EPCB compared with the MCB indicated a significant reduction in gene copy 
number, but although this affects productivity, the quality of CT-P13 from the EPCB was shown to be 
acceptable. Evaluation using a scale-down model showed similar growth profiles from the MCB to the 
EPCB, but clear differences in the cumulative product titre were demonstrated. Product quality was 
examined for differences in impurities (SEC-HPLC and CE-SDS), oligosaccharide profile and charge 
variants (IEC-HPLC), in addition to primary structure (peptide mapping), secondary structure 
(differential scanning calorimetry) and in vitro biological activity (TNFα neutralisation assay). Apparent 
differences observed in IEC-HPLC and the oligosaccharide profile in the in vitro cell age limit cells and 
EPCB were shown to be due to the different preparation methods for these samples, resolving initial 
concerns. The passage number for the “in vitro cell age at harvest of routine production” has been 
clarified and related to numbering in process validation data and data from batches at the production 
scale to date. 
On the whole, the Applicant has demonstrated control of the raw materials used during the manufacture 
of CT-P13. For the cell culture medium components, acceptance criteria have been introduced for 
endotoxin, microbial limits, osmolality and pH, which are satisfactory. 
Extensive process validation has been undertaken for the CT-P13 active substance manufacturing 
process. The validation for the upstream process and downstream process showed that all the 
parameters were within the acceptance criteria and demonstrated that the process was validated. 
Evaluation of the manufacturing process included a bioreactor agitation study and harvest optimisation 
study (centrifuge feed flow rate). A qualified scale-down model for the purification process was used to 
evaluate virus clearance and removal of impurities (HCP, DNA, leached Protein A  and media 
components) in spiking studies. It is noted that aged resin was used for the virus clearance study. All 
these impurities showed clearance in the studies, except for Protein A. The effective clearance of 
impurities was confirmed using data from the full scale manufacturing process. A resin lifetime study 
was also performed at small scale and the results have been confirmed at the manufacturing process 
scale. Cleaning efficiency for the chromatography columns was demonstrated and is monitored at 
intervals during the production process. The hold times for media and buffers used during production 
have been evaluated, along with the hold steps during production; the cumulative hold times have been 
specified and justified. Reprocessing validation (virus filtration and final filtration), shipping validation 
and results from a freeze-thaw study have all been provided. 
Overall the information from the validation runs is appropriately detailed and demonstrates consistent 
performance of the manufacturing process when run at target. After completion of process validation, 
some of the active substance specifications and in-process control acceptance criteria were tightened 
based on re-evaluation of batch data accumulated, in order to monitor and evaluate process 
performance and product quality attributes more efficiently. Clarification has been provided for the 
number of viral filtration reprocessing cycles permitted during the manufacturing process and the 
Inflectra  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589422/2013 
Page 25/105 
 
  
number of times the reprocessing step at the final filtration and filling stage is allowed.  
During process development, several relatively minor changes were made to the manufacturing process. 
The essential elements of the CT-P13 active substance manufacturing process, including the production 
scale, the methods of chromatographic separation and the number and sequence of processing steps, 
were retained throughout process development.  
Comparability to support manufacturing changes made during has been demonstrated using batch 
analysis and additional characterisation. Comparison of primary structure and higher order structures, 
micro-heterogeneity, post-translational forms, purity profile and biological activity of the active 
substance were used to demonstrate comparability. Some batch-to-batch variability in N-glycans was 
detected by two LC-MS methods (quadrupole time-of-flight and liquid chromatography quadrupole MS), 
but no clear trend was observed before and after the changes. There were also differences in the 
quantitation of the Man5, G1F and G2F between these two methods; this was considered to be a 
difference in the accuracy and sensitivity between the methods. Small differences in oligosaccharide 
profiling (relative %) were observed before and after changes, but these were not reflected in the MS 
results. Analysis of pre- and post-change batches by circular dichroism showed no significant difference 
in the higher order structure. TNFα binding affinity (by ELISA and SPR) was comparable and FcγRIIIa 
binding affinity (SPR) was also comparable pre- and post-change. C1q binding appeared slightly lower in 
pre-change batches, but when these were re-tested with additional replicates, there was no difference 
observed. 
Extensive characterisation has been performed for CT-P13 using both active substance and finished 
product manufactured using the proposed commercial process. These batches of finished product were 
also used in Phase I/III clinical studies and in stability/comparability/process validation studies. The 
primary structure of CT-P13 was determined using amino acid analysis, peptide mapping (by LC-MS, 
using trypsin and either Lys-C or Asp-N enzymes), N-terminal sequencing, C-terminal sequencing and 
mass spectrometry. The higher order structure of CT-P13 was determined by assessment of the position 
of disulphide bonds (native and reduced peptide mapping) and free thiol analysis; secondary structure 
analysis using FTIR spectroscopy and circular dichroism (far UV); tertiary structure analysis using 
circular dichroism (near UV); as well as DSC to assess the thermal stability of the molecule. These 
studies revealed the expected results for a monoclonal antibody and confirmed the expected primary 
sequence for infliximab. 
In terms of purities/impurities, CT-P13 was shown to be predominantly monomeric, with only low levels 
of high molecular weight aggregates detected by SEC-HPLC. Forced degradation studies showed that 
low pH and high temperature triggered non-covalent aggregation, which results in decreased biological 
activity as determined using the in vitro TNFα neutralisation assay. The level of aggregates is controlled 
in the active substance and finished product via the monomer content. Extensive analysis by SDS-PAGE 
(non-reducing) showed that the majority of CT-P13 comprised H2L2. The biological activity of the IgG 
fragment was analysed for TNFα binding affinity (by ELISA) and potency (in vitro TNFα neutralisation 
assay), showing no measurable differences between CT-P13 and samples with increased levels of IgG 
fragment in either of these assays. Intact IgG is controlled in CT-P13 (purity by CE-SDS, non-reduced) 
and the specification was tightened based on the levels of intact IgG in the batches of finished product 
used in the clinical trials. The specification will also apply at the end of shelf-life. Purity was also 
determined by CE-SDS (reduced) with the limit employed at active substance and finished product 
release.  
The C-terminal lysine variability, common in IgG molecules, was confirmed by amino acid analysis, 
peptide mapping and C-terminal sequencing. The proportion of molecules without C-terminal lysine (K0) 
represented the most commonly occurring fractions identified by IEC-HPLC, in agreement with the 
LC-ES-MS data.

The Applicant has applied orthogonal methods in order to fully characterise the charged isoforms in 
CT-P13, detected by IEF or identified by IEC-HPLC (cation exchange chromatography). Structural 
analysis for each of the fractionated peaks showed multiple molecular variants which were assigned to 
differences in C-terminal lysine, site-specific deamidation and charged glycan species. The charged 
isoforms were identified as product-related substances, based on biological characterisation of the 
fractionated peaks, compared with the reference standard. Analysis showed comparable relative activity 
in the in vitro TNFα neutralisation activity, TNFα binding affinity by ELISA, FcγRIIIa binding affinity by 
SPR and FcRn binding affinity by SPR, with slightly lower activity determined using the C1q binding 
affinity by ELISA. In the forced degradation studies, it was revealed that CT-P13 deamidation occurs 
more rapidly at high pH and high temperature, with corresponding changes to the IEC-HPLC peak ratio 
due to an increase in acidic forms. TNFα neutralising activity was assessed for samples subject to forced 
degradation; at pH 10.5 (5°C for 7 days) the amount of deamidated species was seen to increase very 
slightly and was associated with a marginal decrease in TNFα neutralising activity, within the variability 
of the cell-based assay. It is accepted that these charged isoforms are classified as product-related 
substances, although they are still controlled in the routine Quality Control (QC) at active substance and 
finished product release. This approach has been followed to ensure that the commercial CT-P13 
finished product will be comparable to the CT-P13 finished product qualified during Phase III clinical 
trials. 
Glycosylation was also analysed using several analytical methods. Site-specific glycosylation analysis 
(by LC-MS peptide analysis and oligosaccharide profiling) was used to determine the range of structures 
at the single N-linked site at Asn300. No O-linked glycosylation was identified, as expected for IgG. 
CT-P13 active substance and finished product contain mostly G0F and G1F glycans, which are the typical 
biantennary glycans found on IgG with no galactose (G0), or one galactose and a core fucose (G1F). A 
range of minor species were also identified (Man5, G0F minus GlcNAc, G0 and G2F) and there were two 
charged glycans, G1F1NeuGc and G2F1NeuGc. Analysis of isolated glycans confirmed these results on 
the whole, although higher levels of G1F glycans were detected using HPAEC-PAD. There also appeared 
to be lower levels of sialylated glycans in the finished product samples by the glycan analysis, although 
this was not confirmed by the later sialic acid analysis, which showed similar levels of N-glycolyl 
neuraminic acid in CT-P13 active substance and finished product samples. The levels of aglycosylation 
detected in CT-P13 active substance or finished product were below the limits of detection. 
The biological activity of infliximab can be categorised into two parts. The primary mechanism of action 
involves the TNFα neutralisation by binding to TNFα and inhibition of cell signalling for proliferation, 
which was studied by in vitro TNFα neutralisation activity, apoptosis, TNFα binding affinity (SPR or ELISA) 
and cell-based TNFα binding affinity. The secondary mechanism of action involves the activation of the 
immune responses which includes ADCC, complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), FcγR family 
binding affinity (SPR), FcRn binding affinity (SPR) and C1q binding affinity (ELISA). For the analysis of 
biological activities, CT-P13 in-house reference materials effective at the time of testing were used. 
The correlation between glycosylation and Fc function of CT-P13 has been investigated. The presence of 
Fc glycans influences the binding of IgG to Fc receptors and C1q; in the case of CT-P13, such binding is 
associated with ADCC and CDC activity, which are secondary mechanisms of action associated with 
infliximab. This binding ability is affected by Fc glycan variability; therefore the FcγRIIIa binding affinity 
(SPR) and C1q binding affinity (ELISA) were studied in order to determine the correlation between 
glycosylation and bioactivity. The correlation between glycosylation and biological activity was assessed 
through the modulation of aglycosylation in CT-P13. The level of aglycosylated CT-P13 is significantly 
lower than the level identified to influence FcγRIIIa binding affinity, therefore this was not considered to 
be an issue. There was no direct correlation observed between terminal galactose and biological activity; 
different levels of agalactosylation did not impact FcγRIIIa binding affinity or C1q binding affinity. 
Consistency of glycosylation can be affected by fermentation parameters and factors such as 
Inflectra  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589422/2013 
Page 27/105 
 
  
fucosylation are known to influence the Fc function in antibodies. Glycosylation needs to be controlled 
during the manufacturing process and the Applicant has introduced specifications for the glycosylation in 
CT-P13 active substance. 
Very low levels of oxidised species were detected in CT-P13 active substance or finished product batches 
(peptide mapping with LC-MS) following storage at 5 ± 3°C for 16 and 10 months, and even following 
storage of finished product under stress conditions (40 ± 2°C/75 ± 5% RH) for 9 months. However, it is 
noted that storage of the active substance at 25 ± 2°C/60 ± 5% RH for 16 months did result in 
significant product oxidation. A forced degradation study showed that a substantial increase in product 
oxidation did not have a substantial impact on biological activity (in vitro TNFα neutralisation assay), 
with any differences observed within the variability of the assay. Oxidation is not expected to have a 
deleterious effect on the efficacy of the finished product and therefore oxidised molecular variants are 
classified as product-related substances. As such, oxidised species will not be assessed during routine 
QC of the CT-P13 active substance or finished product at release or in stability studies. This is accepted. 
Process-related impurities were efficiently cleared during the purification process, which was 
demonstrated using a combination of spiking studies and results from the process validation and 
historical batches. In addition, limits were set for HCP, host cell DNA and residual rProtein A in the active 
substance batch release testing.  
The Applicant has validated the analytical methods using CT-P13 active substance. In some cases, 
addendum studies were performed using these same assays but with additional validation parameters 
or use of specific impurities/degraded samples in order to complete the validation. The assay validation 
is satisfactory. 
The proposed active substance specification includes general controls (clarity, colour, visible particles, 
pH), as well as control testing for safety (endotoxin, bioburden), identity (IEF, IEC-HPLC), 
purity/impurity (IEC-HPLC, reduced and non-reduced CE-SDS, SEC-HPLC, HCP, DNA, residual protein A), 
content and potency. The test items are in line with the requirements for the active substance in Ph. Eur. 
2031, as well as with relevant guidelines. The Applicant has provided a detailed justification for the 
active substance specifications, with the same acceptance criteria at active substance release and at 
end-of-shelf-life, to ensure that the CT-P13 active substance is stable during storage. The exception to 
end-of-shelf-life specifications is the omission of tests for process-related impurities such as HCP, host 
cell DNA and residual rProtein A, as well as identity by means of IEC-HPLC, which is acceptable. On the 
whole, the majority of acceptance criteria in the specifications are based on the batch data mean values 
± 3SD, which takes into account the batch results and allows for assay variability. The Applicant has 
re-evaluated the acceptance criteria for purity by IEC-HPLC and introduced additional limits, while also 
tightening the limit for non-reducing CE-SDS based on batch data. The endotoxin limit is justified based 
both on batch data and the calculated maximum allowable dose given in Ph. Eur. for parenteral products 
(10 IU/mL), which is acceptable. The residual DNA limits are also justified based on batch data and this 
is well below the calculated maximum allowable dose given in Ph. Eur. (10 ng/dose), which is acceptable. 
The limits proposed for residual HCP were tightened to bring these in line with the batch data. The initial 
proposed limits for residual rProtein A were reduced based on batch data, since no real clearance of this 
contaminant was demonstrated in spiking studies. 
Revision of the proposed active substance specifications for glycosylation was made following a request 
from CHMP, with inclusion of Man5 in the afucosylated glycan specification of CT-P13 active substance 
(G0+Man5). Proposed acceptance criteria were tightened for fucosylated glycans G0F+G1F+G2F (and 
specifications were included for charged glycans SA1+SA2 in line with batch data. 
It is noted that the current and superseded CT-P13 reference standards used in the potency assay were 
qualified against Remicade with respect to in vitro bioactivity, and both reference standards employed to 
date are closely matched to the reference product in terms of in vitro bioactivity. The Remicade 
Inflectra  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589422/2013 
Page 28/105 
 
  
reference standard was prepared by combining multiple batches of Remicade; this was used to establish 
the CT-P13 reference standard. The information regarding CT-P13 reference standard annual 
re-qualification, introduction of working reference standard and introduction of a new primary reference 
standard (in the future) are acceptable, except for use of a reagent grade TNFα to calibrate the CT-P13 
reference standard. Following a request from the CHMP, an International Standard for TNFα will be used 
to calibrate future batches of reference standard/working reference standard, in order to demonstrate 
that there is no drift in the potency of CT-P13. 
The container closure system has been demonstrated to be suitable for its intended use for the active 
substance. 
The Applicant has provided stability data for batches tested at both the proposed storage temperatures 
and under accelerated conditions (25 ± 2°C/ 60 ± 5% RH). The data demonstrate that IEC-HPLC, 
CE-SDS (reduced and non-reduced), SEC-HPLC and the in vitro bioactivity assay are all 
stability-indicating assays. The data supports the claimed shelf-life of 6 months at 5 ± 3°C for the active 
substance. The proposed shelf-life for CT-P13 active substance stored at -40 ± 5°C is 36 months. The 
stability data indicate that CT-P13 is photo-sensitive and the Applicant has committed to store the active 
substance away from sources of light, both during storage and during shipment (in a freezer or 
refrigerator). 
•  Finished product 
The Applicant has used the same pharmaceutical form and formulation throughout development. The 
proposed commercial CT-P13 finished product formulation is identical to the one which has been 
clinically qualified and is the same as Remicade. Formulation optimisation studies have been undertaken, 
as recommended in EMEA/CHMP/BWP/49348/2005 Guideline. Similar results were obtained for stability 
studies performed using Remicade and the rate of degradation of the two products can be considered 
comparable. 
The CT-P13 finished product manufacturing process has not been changed significantly throughout 
development; the unit operations are identical, the process parameters are similar and most changes 
are related to scale-up and minor adaptations to the process at the different facilities. Comparability 
programmes were undertaken to demonstrate comparability between finished products manufactured 
at the two different facilities. Slightly higher residual moisture levels were observed between 
comparability batches. Although these levels are both below the specification, these differences were 
investigated and shown to be related to the equipment used in preparation of the samples for analysis, 
not due to any differences in the lyophilisation at these facilities. There were also higher levels of 
sub-visible particles in finished product from one of the facilities, although these were variable and 
remained within the Ph. Eur. specification. 
The manufacturing process has been validated and can consistently produce CT-P13 finished product of 
the required quality. Clarification of in-process hold times and filtration contact times has been provided. 
Two CQAs have been determined for the finished product manufacturing process. CPPs that have impact 
on the CQA have been identified. Historical data for the in-process controls from both facilities is 
presented to support the control parameters. The control strategy of finished product manufacturing 
process has been further clarified and the present strategy is supported by process characterisation data, 
validation and commercial scale manufacturing experience. All the excipients used in the formulation of 
CT-P13 finished product comply with compendial requirements.  
The analytical methods used for finished product release were originally validated at Celltrion for control 
of both active substance and finished product. Following the original method validations, further 
verifications/qualifications were conducted in order to transfer the analytical procedures to the EU 
release testing site. The inter-laboratory comparability studies initially raised some concern with regard 
Inflectra  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589422/2013 
Page 29/105 
 
  
 
to the differences in assay performance, but analysis of further batches at both sites provided assurance 
of the potency assay performance at these two facilities. 
The justifications for the specifications are accepted, including the reconstitution time which has been 
tightened based on batch data. In addition, in line with the active substance specification and 
considering that no significant trend of decreased purity during real-temperature stability studies are 
seen, the acceptance limits for purity by IEC-HPLC and by non-reducing CE-SDS were revised to reflect 
manufacturing capacity, as well as the purity/impurity profile of the clinical batches. 
The Applicant has made a reasonable case for exclusion of FcγR binding and the amount of oxidised 
molecular variants; these omissions from the specifications are accepted. The Applicant has made a 
case for not introducing a specification for the glycosylation of CT-P13 finished product, based on 
analysis of glycans present in batches of active substance and finished product. No differences were 
observed, particularly in parameters which may be affected by the lyophilisation, such as sialylation. 
Since the glycosylation will be controlled as part of the active substance specification, there is no need 
for further specifications at the finished product level. 
The container closure system has been demonstrated to be suitable for its intended use for CT-P13 
finished product. Details of the lyophilisation, capping and crimping hold times have been given for the 
finished product manufacturing sites. Shipping details under controlled conditions have also been 
provided. 
All stability studies for CT-P13 finished product have been designed in compliance with ICH Q5C 
guideline. One storage condition is proposed for the CT-P13 finished product (5 ± 3°C), with long-term 
(real-time/ real-condition) stability testing performed at 5 ± 3°C. In addition, accelerated stability at 25 
± 2°C/ 60 ± 5% RH and stressed stability at 40 ± 2°C/75 ± 5% RH have been conducted. All finished 
product batches entered into the stability studies were stored in an identical container closure system to 
that proposed for commercial supply of the CT-P13 finished product. 
The Applicant proposes a shelf-life of 36 months when stored at 2-8°C and has provided stability data 
generated under real time/real temperature conditions to support this shelf-life.  
The results of the accelerated stability studies demonstrate that there was no change in the quality of 
the CT-P13 finished product during storage. No trend was observed for the finished product up to and 
including the 6 month testing time point, with the exception of the amount of intact IgG molecule (as 
determined by CE-SDS non-reduced). All batches remained within the proposed commercial acceptance 
criteria under accelerated conditions. 
Stressed stability studies (40 ± 2°C/75 ± 5% RH) were performed and no change was observed in the 
quality of the CT-P13 finished product during the 3 months of storage. For stability-indicating 
parameters, no data trend for finished product was noted, with the exception of the amount of intact IgG 
molecule (as determined by CE-SDS non-reduced). Nevertheless, all batches remained within the 
proposed commercial acceptance criterion. 
In order to understand product stability following reconstitution and dilution, an in-use stability study 
has also been conducted at two storage conditions: 5 ± 3°C and 30 ± 2°C/65 ± 5% RH, with time points 
at 0, 24 and 48 hours. The results demonstrate that there was no significant change in the quality of the 
CT-P13 finished product during the 48-hour period when stored at either temperature. A general trend 
of an increase in the amount of sub-visible particles was observed over the course of the study for some 
(but not all) batches; nevertheless, all batches remained within the acceptance criterion up to and 
including the final testing time point. An additional infusion bag study was performed to evaluate the 
sub-visible particles, which confirmed that the levels were variable under all conditions tested (5±3°C 
and 30±2°C/65±5% RH) for 6 batches of CT-P13 at either 3mg/kg or 5mg/kg, but all these remained 
below the Ph. Eur. limits. The available data shows that the reconstituted finished product prepared as 
Inflectra  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589422/2013 
Page 30/105 
 
  
a dilution for infusion is stable for up to 48 hours when stored at 5 ± 3°C (refrigerated) or 30 ± 2°C/65 
± 5% RH (room temperature). From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used as soon 
as possible but within 3 hours of reconstitution and dilution. If not used immediately, in use storage 
times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and should not be longer than 24 
hours at 2 to 8°C. 
Given that CT-P13 has been developed as a biosimilar medicinal product, stability testing has also been 
performed using Remicade. Specifically, batches of Remicade have been assessed following storage at 
various conditions (long-term, accelerated, stressed, in-use upon reconstitution and dilution for 
infusion); all Remicade batches used for stability testing were stored in the product’s native container 
closure. For the 5 ± 3°C real-time/real-condition storage condition, the available data demonstrate that 
CT-P13 finished product is comparable to Remicade, since there was no change in the quality of the 
CT-P13 finished product or Remicade during long-term storage at 5 ± 3°C for the duration of testing (24 
months). The protein content for the tested Remicade batches fell below the proposed commercial 
CT-P13 end-of-shelf-life specification at the 12 months testing time point; this was attributed to the fact 
that the Remicade batches in the stability study were ‘older’ than the CT-P13 batches at the time the 
study was initiated. For accelerated and stress stability testing, it was demonstrated that CT-P13 and 
Remicade have a comparable degradation profile.  
•  Adventitious Agents 
Non-viral adventitious agents 
All animal-derived raw materials used for the production of CT-P13 have been evaluated in relation to 
the risk of introducing transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) agents to the product, in 
accordance with the EMEA/410/01 Rev. 3 Note for Guidance. It was demonstrated that the TSE risk 
associated with raw materials used during the manufacture of CT-P13 and the development of the 
production cell line is highly unlikely. 
The safety of CT-P13 with regard to adventitious microbial, mycoplasma and fungal agents is considered 
assured. There are appropriate control systems in place with respect to raw materials and in-house 
prepared buffers. The in-process testing strategy employed throughout the manufacturing process 
monitors and controls microbial contamination.  
Mycoplasma and microbial bioburden are controlled during manufacture through use of a sanitary 
and/or aseptic process design. In-process control testing of intermediates for bioburden and endotoxin 
is also routinely carried out to ensure microbial safety throughout manufacture. Bioburden, sterility 
(finished product only) and endotoxin are included in the routine active substance and product release 
strategies which ensure only materials of suitable quality with respect to microbial safety are released 
for further processing or for commercial supply.  
MCB and WCB characterisation included a test for mycoplasma which was negative; the EPCB was also 
tested and no contamination of mycoplasma was observed. The manufacturing process has 
intermediate product testing for this potential contaminant, and no positive results have been observed. 
Viral adventitious agents 
The safety of CT-P13 with regard to adventitious viral agents is assured through the quality control 
systems in place and validation of the downstream purification process with respect to viral clearance. 
There are appropriate systems in place in relation to the source, receipt and acceptance of raw materials 
of biological origin that may pose a contamination risk. No raw materials of animal origin are used during 
the cell culture process, so there is minimal risk for the introduction of adventitious viral agents in the 
CT-P13 manufacturing process via this route. Viral agents are likely to be detected through the in vitro 
Inflectra

adventitious virus testing performed on unprocessed bulk during routine manufacturing; results on 
unprocessed bulk manufactured at commercial scale, and the in-vitro adventitious virus testing that has 
been carried out on a routine basis for unprocessed bulk of all the batches produced indicate that 
adventitious agents are not introduced or detected in CT-P13. However, based on the characterisation of 
cell banks (MCB and EPCB), it is known that type A and type C retroviral particles could be present in the 
fermentation harvest and the CT-P13 purification process is validated to demonstrate clearance of this 
potential impurity in the final product. All other virus screening tests used for cell line characterisation 
were negative. 
For the endogenous retroviruses, the presence of these particles is expected given the observation of 
retrovirus-like particles in the MCB and EPCB. However, the co-cultivation assay using Mus dunni cells 
demonstrated that no infectious retrovirus-like particles could be detected in unprocessed bulk that was 
tested. In addition active substance batches have also been tested for evidence of retrovirus infectivity 
(using the co-cultivation assay using Mus dunni cells) and all these were negative. As such, there is 
evidence that no infectious virus particles are present in active substance.  
The CT-P13 purification process steps validated for virus clearance were the low-pH treatment, the 
nanofiltration and two orthogonal chromatographic unit operations. Viral clearance of CT-P13 was 
evaluated in scaled-down studies by spiking a relevant virus and non-specific model viruses into process 
intermediates obtained from active substance batches. Reduced scale models of the chromatography 
steps and the low-pH treatment and viral filtration steps were used to evaluate clearance of A-MuLV, 
MVM, pseudorabies virus (PrV), and reovirus-3 (Reo-3). For the reduced scale viral clearance studies, 
process parameters that were considered likely to influence the viral clearance/inactivation were run 
using worst-case conditions, or evaluated at the extremes of the defined operating ranges. A-MuLV was 
studied because it represents the retroviruses present in the host cell line. The non-specific model 
viruses were chosen in accordance with ICH Q5A (R1) to represent a combination of RNA and DNA 
viruses, enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, and a wide range of virus families of variable particle size 
and chemical resistance. 
A-MuLV was used as a relevant virus for the retroviruses particles present in Sp2/0 cell lines. 
Considering average retrovirus-like particles present in unprocessed bulk, a minimum of clearance is 
required in the downstream process to achieve ≤1 particle per million doses. The virus clearance study 
has demonstrated sufficient log reduction for A-MuLV through the downstream manufacturing process, 
demonstrating that the CT-P13 manufacturing process has an adequate safety margin for the retrovirus 
removal. 
Viral clearance on new or aged resin for MVM, PrV or Reo-3 was also considered satisfactory. The virus 
carry-over study also demonstrated that the column cleaning and regeneration processes for two 
chromatography resins are effective and capable of removing residual virus if applicable. 
Based on all the data provided, it can be concluded that the viral safety of CT-P13 finished product is 
assured. 
•  Comparability with the Reference Medicinal Product 
A comprehensive and state-of-the-art comparability exercise has been performed for the proposed 
CT-P13 biosimilar product with the RMP Remicade. The Applicant has used multiple batches of CT-P13 
finished product and Remicade for each analysis. All batches of Remicade were sourced in the EU. In 
many of the analytical evaluations, CT-P13 active substance was also used; this has a similar 
formulation (in liquid form) to the finished product. Infliximab was not extracted from the RMP since the 
formulation does not interfere with the analytical methods used.

Primary and higher order structures 
The primary structure of CT-P13 and the RMP was confirmed to be identical by amino acid analysis, 
sequencing using peptide mapping (in combination with MS/MS), N-terminal sequencing and C-terminal 
sequencing, except for differences in the levels of C-terminal lysine. In relation to the C-terminal lysine 
levels, a greater proportion of IgG heavy chain without lysine (K0) in CT-P13 active substance and 
finished product and lower levels of IgG heavy chain with one lysine (K1), compared with Remicade, 
were determined under reducing conditions by LC-ESI-MS. Heterogeneity is common for C-terminal 
lysine in IgG and this is acceptable under the current guidance for similar biological medicinal products; 
this is unlikely to impact efficacy and safety of the proposed biosimilar product. 
The higher order structure of CT-P13 and RMP were shown to be comparable. The positions of disulphide 
bonds matched (native and reduced peptide mapping) and the free thiol content per mole IgG was 
similar. Secondary and tertiary structure analysis did not show any significant difference. DSC showed 
three transition temperatures for the CT-P13 and RMP samples, which were similar for the CT-P13 
finished product and Remicade, indicating comparable folding of the proteins. Further structural data 
was provided using X-ray crystallography of the Fc domains of CT-P13 or Remicade, with identical unit 
cell dimensions and superimposition of all carbon alpha atoms between the two structures, 
demonstrating that Fc domains of CT-P13 and Remicade have comparable 3-D structures.  
Purity 
Differences were observed in purity, with slightly higher levels of aggregates in CT-P13 compared with 
RMP (SEC-HPLC). This has been discussed by the Applicant, in terms of the relative ages of the CT-P13 
and Remicade batches used for the analysis and the monomer content vs. HMW content respectively. No 
changes were observed over 12 to 33 months storage of either CT-P13 or Remicade. The percentage of 
monomer exceeded 99% in all cases, including CT-P13 batches stored for 36 months under long-term 
conditions (5 ± 3°C). Given the low content of HMW species in CT-P13, this is not expected to impact on 
clinical safety and efficacy. The differences observed are consistent with commonly observed ranges for 
monoclonal antibodies. 
There are differences in the level of intact IgG determined by CE-SDS (non-reduced), with lower levels 
in CT-P13 finished product than in Remicade batches. The content of the six bands identified by CE-SDS 
(non-reduced) was determined following extraction and purification with subsequent LC-MS analysis. 
Both products display the same array of six IgG molecular variants: the main component was two heavy 
chains and two light chains, H2L2 (the intact IgG monomer), and the main non-assembled CT-P13 form 
comprised two heavy chains and one light chain, with lower levels of other combinations of heavy and 
light chains. Therefore, this CT-P13 molecular variant is responsible for much of the difference in intact 
IgG content between CT-P13 and the RMP. The Applicant demonstrated that the TNFα binding affinity 
and in vitro TNFα neutralising activity were not impacted by increased H2L1 fragment; this justification 
was considered adequate. 
The CT-P13 charged molecular variants have been analysed using IEF, IEC-HPLC, as well as peptide 
mapping. There are a number of post-translational modifications that have the potential to influence 
CT-P13 charge heterogeneity, notably C-terminal lysine variability, product deamidation, product 
oxidation and sialylation. Results from IEF analysis show that the calculated pI values are comparable 
and fall within similar ranges for CT-P13 active substance, finished product and Remicade samples. Both 
the CT-P13 and RMP showed six peaks when analysed by IEC-HPLC, but differences were noted in the 
relative proportions of each peak compared to Remicade. The biological activity of each isolated peak 
was assessed, demonstrating similar potency by in vitro TNFα neutralisation analysis, TNFα binding 
affinity (by ELISA) and FcRn binding affinity (SPR) for all peaks, although some variability was noted in 
peak 1 for CT-P13. Comparable results were also observed in C1q binding for CT-P13 compared with 
Remicade. All isolated IEC-HPLC peaks showed differences in FcγRIIIa binding affinity, with lower values 
Inflectra  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589422/2013 
Page 33/105 
 
  
for the CT-P13 isoforms compared with Remicade. This was confirmed by analysis of CT-P13 and RMP in 
the biological assays. 
The Applicant’s conclusion that the difference in IEC-HPLC peak ratio is likely to be the result of 
C-terminal lysine variability is supported by the CHMP. In order to support the Applicant’s position that 
the difference in IEC-HPLC peak ratio is the result of C-terminal lysine variability, three experimental 
approaches were undertaken. The data provided justified the Applicant’s position and gave assurance 
that rapid cleavage of the C-terminal lysine occurs in blood following administration of CT-P13. 
Therefore, the differences in IEC-HPLC peak ratio are unlikely to impact on its bioactivity in vivo and thus 
have no clinically meaningful impact.  
Oxidised variants were slightly higher in CT-P13 than in the RMP. An additional study showed that 
oxidation levels only slightly increase, in either CT-P13 finished product or Remicade under long-term 
(2-8°C), accelerated (25 ± 2°C/60 ± 5% RH) or stress conditions (40 ± 2°C/75 ± 5% RH), for at least 
9 months (CT-P13) or 20 months (Remicade). A significant increase in oxidation was observed in CT-P13 
active substance under accelerated conditions for 16 months, but this is expected since the liquid state 
is more susceptible to oxidation. The forced degradation study demonstrated that a substantial increase 
in oxidation did not have a substantial effect on potency using the in vitro TNFα neutralisation activity 
and therefore the small increase in oxidation in CT-P13 is unlikely to have an impact. It is noted that the 
degradation profile of CT-P13 and Remicade is comparable in long-term stability studies. The stability 
testing has not revealed any differences that could have implications for the safety or efficacy of the 
CT-P13. According to the results presented by the Applicant, the increased oxidation observed in CT-P13 
compared to Remicade is not linked to a decreased bioactivity. 
Further information considering the differences in the age of the Remicade and CT-P13 material at time 
of analyses showed no trends for purity/impurities over storage from 12 to 33 months. In addition, 
biological activity evaluated by TNFα binding affinity (ELISA), TNFα neutralising activity, apoptosis, CDC, 
ADCC, FcRn binding affinity and C1q binding affinity, also showed comparable values for the different 
batches of Remicade and CT-P13 over different storage times. For FcγRIIIa binding affinity by SPR, 
batches of Remicade showed higher relative affinity compared with CT-P13 finished product but no 
trends were seen for FcγRIIIa binding affinity in the older batches. 
Protein content 
Slightly higher protein content was measured in CT-P13 compared to Remicade using the validated UV 
method. Protein concentration data from further CT-P13 and Remicade batches were submitted to show 
that this difference is due to batch-to-batch variability of Remicade, and that CT-P13 protein 
concentration was within the range of the reference product, considering the intrinsic variability of the 
assay.  
Glycosylation 
Asn300 was shown to be the only site of N-glycosylation for both CT-P13 and Remicade. No O-linked 
glycans were detected for CT-P13 or the RMP, as expected for an IgG1 monoclonal antibody. Some 
differences in the levels of G0, G0F, G2F and the sialic acid containing glycans (higher levels of 
G1FNeuGc and G2F1NeuGc for CT-P13 finished product compared with RMP) were observed, but in 
general the glycans were similar in both CT-P13 finished product and the RMP, with no new glycans 
detected. The main glycans detected in both products are G0F and G1F, typical for IgG. The 
monosaccharide content of both CT-P13 and RMP were similar for the neutral and amino sugars (molar 
ratios). The sialic acid analysis demonstrated that both CT-P13 and RMP contain NeuGc at comparable 
levels. There was a difference in the level of afucosylated glycans, Man5 and G0 for CT-P13 and Man5, 
G0 and G2 for Remicade, which needs to be considered in relation to the biological activity.

The Applicant has investigated the correlation between glycosylation and Fc function of CT-P13 and 
Remicade. Reduced glycosylation correlates with lower FcγRIIIa relative binding affinity (using SPR) and 
lower C1q binding affinity (using ELISA) for both CT-P13 and Remicade. This demonstrated a clear 
correlation between glycosylation and Fc function and a substantial effect of aglycosylation. In contrast, 
agalactosylation did not affect FcγRIIIa binding affinity and C1q binding affinity; even with reduction of 
galactose levels to zero, the relative binding affinities were close to 100%. 
Biological activity 
No differences between the bioactivity of CT-P13 and Remicade were detected in the in vitro TNFα 
neutralisation assay, the apoptosis assay (using tmTNFα Jurkat cells), the cell-based TNFα binding 
affinity assay, as well as in the CDC assay. The results were also highly similar for FcγRI, FcγRIIa, 
FcγRIIb and TNFα binding affinity by SPR, as well as for TNFα and C1q binding affinity by ELISA. The 
FcRn binding of CT-P13 finished product was also shown to be comparable to Remicade using additional 
batches of finished product, with overlapping data sets. The potential impact of differences in 
afucosylation between CT-P13 and Remicade was studied further by using an artificially made highly 
afucosylated CT-P13 mixed with CT-P13 standard, to give an afucosylation level similar to that of 
Remicade in these assays. This confirmed that there was no difference in binding to FcγRI, FcγRIIa, 
FcγRIIb and FcRn (SPR), C1q binding (ELISA) and CDC activity due to differences in core afucosylation 
levels. No difference in binding activity to TNFα (ELISA or cell-based assay), TNFα neutralisation activity 
or apoptosis using tmTNFα Jurkat cells was observed using this highly afucosylated CT-P13. 
The Applicant has provided more information on the observed binding difference between infliximab in 
Inflectra and Remicade towards FcγRIIIa and discussed the possible reason behind this difference. The 
Applicant confirmed that V-type FcγRIIIa polymorphic variant was employed in the initial assays 
submitted in the marketing authorisation application (MAA). The difference has now been confirmed in 
additional SPR studies using the V-type FcγRIIIa variant. Binding to V-type FcγRIIIa was correlated to 
the level of fucosylation, demonstrated by significantly reduced binding of CT-P13 compared with the 
highly afucosylated CT-P13. This difference in binding was also observed with FcγRIIIa F-type 
hemizygote in the SPR assay. Significantly reduced binding was also observed to FcγRIIIb for CT-P13 
compared with Remicade or highly afucosylated CT-P13 which was not unexpected as this receptor has 
a high sequence homology with FcγRIIIa. 
A difference in binding was also shown in ex vivo studies on enriched Natural Killer (NK) cells from 
healthy donor PBMC: for the high affinity binding FcγRIIIa receptor 158V/V genotype, a decrease in 
binding of CT-P13 compared to Remicade was detected. A similar decrease in binding was also seen for 
the 158V/F genotype while no difference between CT-P13 and Remicade was observed for the 158F/F 
genotype. These binding studies were extended to include NK cells derived from Crohn’s disease 
patients of all genotypes, with reduced binding for CT-P13 (in V/V genotype and V/F genotype) 
compared with Remicade, but no difference in overall mean binding using NK cells from patients of F/F 
genotype. Binding of CT-P13 and Remicade to NK cells was also performed in the presence of diluted 
Crohn’s disease patient serum, to mimic the in vivo environment. This showed an overall reduction in 
total binding, but the level of residual binding was comparable, showing an abrogation of the difference 
in binding previously seen with CT-P13 and Remicade (in the absence of serum) for V/V and V/F 
genotypes. It is suggested that this reduction in overall binding and abrogation of any observed 
differences is due to the presence of immune complexes, soluble serum factors and/or monomeric IgG 
in the serum. Therefore the relevance of binding differences to FcγRIIIa on NK cells, observed under 
more stringent in vitro conditions, may not be extrapolated into a clinical effect in patients.  
Binding of CT-P13, Remicade or the highly afucosylated CT-P13  to neutrophils from healthy donors or 
Crohn’s disease patients was studied in vitro to examine binding to FcγRIIIb receptors in a more native 
conformation on the surface of relevant cells in vitro. There were no differences in binding to neutrophils, 
Inflectra  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589422/2013 
Page 35/105 
 
  
which have high levels of FcγRIIIb as well as FcγRI and FcγRIIa on the cell surface. Therefore, 
differences in binding of CT-P13 and Remicade to FcγRIIIb in the SPR assay did not translate to a 
difference in binding to healthy donor or Crohn’s disease patient neutrophils. 
The Applicant has also provided ADCC activity data from additional CT-P13 and Remicade batches using 
healthy donor PBMC (V/F genotype). Dose-response results were provided and the results did not 
indicate any differences in the ADCC responses between CT-P13 and Remicade. Accuracy, intermediate 
precision, repeatability and specificity were determined for the ADCC assay, with acceptable results. 
Sensitivity of the ADCC assay was evaluated by comparing deglycosylated and afucosylated CT-P13 to 
untreated CT-P13 samples, using Jurkat cells expressing tmTNFα as target cells and PBMC as effector 
cells. These studies demonstrated the sensitivity of the ADCC assay, but only at higher levels of 
afucosylation. The ADCC assay was not able to discriminate between samples where the afucosylation 
level was below 12%. This raised concern initially, as it was questionable whether the ADCC assay using 
PBMC effector cells was sensitive enough to detect potential differences between the biosimilar and the 
originator.  
The sensitivity of the ADCC assay was improved using NK cells as effector cells in this assay, with 
confirmation that ADCC is dependent on glycosylation and influenced by core fucose levels. Significant 
differences were noted in the cytotoxic response in this assay for CT-P13 and Remicade, using NK cells 
from Crohn’s disease patients of V/V and V/F genotypes but not the F/F genotype. This was consistent 
with the binding data shown with enriched NK cells and also the levels of afucosylation in CT-P13 and 
Remicade. The reason for differences in ADCC using NK cells but not PBMC is likely to be attributed to the 
mixed cell population present in PBMC, with multiple Fc receptors available for binding to CT-P13 and 
Remicade. This was further evaluated by using whole blood as effector cells in the ADCC assay, with 
comparable ADCC responses noted with CT-P13 and Remicade. Therefore, under conditions more 
representative of the in vivo situation (PBMC or whole blood), the difference in fucosylation for CT-P13 
and Remicade does not have any impact on ADCC. 
Further investigation was undertaken to examine any likely impact in patients, since differences 
observed in binding to FcγRIIIa were not confirmed by differences in ADCC using PBMC from healthy 
donors as effector cells and tmTNFα Jurkat cells as target cells in previous studies. No differences were 
observed in ADCC for CT-P13 or Remicade using PBMC from Crohn’s disease patients of V/F or F/F 
genotype, although a lower dose-response curve was observed with PBMC from Crohn’s disease patients 
compared with healthy donor PBMC (V/F genotype). This lower response may be attributed to the lower 
number of NK cells and CD16 expression levels measured in Crohn’s disease patient PBMC compared 
with healthy donor PBMC. A previous study had shown that cytotoxicity in rheumatoid arthritis patient 
PBMC was essentially abrogated compared with healthy donor and Crohn’s disease patient PBMC, 
although the genotype of this rheumatoid arthritis patient was not specified. 
In addition, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated monocytes were used as target cells in the ADCC assay, 
to mimic the in vivo inflammatory situation. No ADCC response was detected using LPS-stimulated 
monocytes from healthy donor (V/F) or Crohn’s disease patient (V/F) as target cells. The fact that ADCC 
can only be detected when using tmTNFα Jurkat cells as target cells which have much higher levels of 
tmTNFα, suggests that ADCC may be limited or absent under physiological conditions in vivo. 
Additional Fc-mediated biological activity was explored to determine if the difference in fucosylation 
between CT-P13 and Remicade is likely to have an impact in vivo. Induction of regulatory macrophages 
and inhibition of T-cell proliferation using a two-way allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction 
demonstrated no difference between CT-P13 and Remicade, for all genotypes (V/V, V/F and F/F) from 
either healthy donors or Crohn’s disease patients. The biological activity of the CT-P13, Remicade or the 
highly afucosylated CT-P13 induced regulatory macrophages was compared in an in vitro wound healing 
model using human colon epithelial cells. No differences in the closure of a scratch in the cell monolayer 
Inflectra  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589422/2013 
Page 36/105 
 
  
could be detected, confirming that the different level of fucosylation does not impact the biological 
activity when conditions are used which mimic the in vivo situation. 
Dose-dependent suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibition of apoptosis was also 
demonstrated in a model of inflammation using a human intestinal epithelial cell line, to support the 
extrapolation to inflammatory bowel disease. 
In conclusion, a comprehensive battery of in vitro assays has been applied to characterise biological 
activity. The assays used are specific to Inflectra (CT-P13) and have been suitably justified during the 
assessment of this MAA. In some cases, differences were identified; Inflectra exhibits a lower level of 
afucosylated glycans than Remicade, hence a lower binding affinity to FcγRIIIa and a lower activity in 
the most sensitive ADCC assay using NK cells as effector cells and tmTNFα Jurkat target cells. However, 
no difference could be detected in several experiments that are more representative of 
pathophysiological conditions, and therefore more relevant clinically (e.g. in blood, in a mixed 
lymphocyte reaction from FcγRIIIa genotype matched PBMCs with induction of a subset of regulatory 
macrophages, in a wound healing model using induced cells that include these macrophages on a culture 
of human colorectal epithelium cells). 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Overall, the quality of Inflectra is considered to be in line with the quality of other approved monoclonal 
antibodies. The different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological documentation comply 
with existing guidelines. The fermentation and purification of the active substance are adequately 
described, controlled and validated. The active substance is well characterised with regard to its 
physicochemical and biological characteristics, using state-of the-art methods, and appropriate 
specifications are set. The manufacturing process of the finished product has been satisfactorily 
described and validated. The quality of the finished product is controlled by adequate test methods and 
specifications. Viral safety and the safety concerning other adventitious agents including TSE have been 
sufficiently assured. 
Biosimilarity with the reference medicinal product Remicade has been sufficiently demonstrated. From a 
quality point of view, the observed differences and levels of these differences have been well 
documented and are acceptable. 
The overall Quality of Inflectra is considered acceptable. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The nonclinical comparability program versus Remicade included pharmacodynamic (PD), 
pharmacokinetics (PK) and toxicological studies. The non-clinical data consisted in several in vitro 
primary PD studies (including a human tissue cross reactivity study comparing CT-P13 and Remicade), 2 
pivotal toxicology studies (one with toxicokinetics [TK] and immunogenicity testing) and 1 PK study in 
order to compare the bioactivity profiles of CT-P13 with Remicade. In addition, a dose-range-finding 
study investigating the toxicity, TK and immunogenicity of Remicade has been conducted.

The nonclinical development program with CT-P13 was performed in agreement with the CHMP scientific 
advices (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/572897/2009 Procedure No.: EMEA/H/SA/1385/1/2009/II and the Follow 
up EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/788787/2009 Procedure No.: EMEA/H/SA/1385/1/FU/1/2009/II). The nonclinical 
development program was performed according to the EMA guidance on similar biological medicinal 
products containing monoclonal antibodies (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010) and on similar biological 
medicinal products containing biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance: non-clinical and 
clinical issues (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005) and with ICH guideline S6 (RI) –preclinical safety 
evaluation of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals Step 5 (EMA/CHMP/ICH/731268/1998). 
The in vivo comparative 2 week toxicity studies in rats and immunohistochemistry study of 
cross-reactivity in human tissues were performed in compliance with GLP requirements. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The biological activity of infliximab can be categorised into two parts. The primary mechanism of action 
involves the TNFα neutralisation by binding to TNFα and inhibition of cell signalling for proliferation. 
Assays for this include in vitro TNFα neutralisation activity, apoptosis, TNFα binding affinity (Surface 
Plasmon Resonance (SPR)), TNFα binding affinity (ELISA) for potency measurements, and cell-based 
TNFα binding affinity. The secondary mechanism of action involves the activation of the immune 
responses which includes ADCC, CDC, FcγR family binding affinity (SPR), FcRn binding affinity (SPR) and 
C1q binding affinity (ELISA). 
Primary PD consisted of 33 in vitro studies assessing the binding affinity of CT-P13 and Remicade to 
soluble (from different species) and transmembrane form of human TNFα, TNFβ, FcγRI, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIIa, 
FcRn and C1q; the TNFα neutralisation activity; the CDC, ADCC, apoptotic effects; and the 
cross-reactivity with various human tissues.  
Remicade was included as reference product in all of these studies.  
The type, test method used and key findings of these studies can be found in the quality section 2 of this 
report  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies have been performed. No requirements for secondary 
pharmacodynamics studies have been detailed in relevant guidelines including the CHMP guidance on 
similar biological medicinal products containing monoclonal antibodies 
(EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010). Off-target toxicological investigations have been performed in 
repeat-dose toxicity studies using the rat, with comparable off-target findings observed in this species. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
No safety pharmacology studies have been performed in line with CHMP guidance on similar biological 
medicinal products containing monoclonal antibodies (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010), which states 
that safety pharmacology studies are not required for non-clinical testing of biosimilar mAbs. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No comparative studies assessing PD drug interactions have been performed with CT-P13. No 
requirements for PD drug interactions studies have been detailed in relevant guidelines including the 
CHMP guidance on similar biological medicinal products containing monoclonal antibodies 
(EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010).

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK data consisted in a single study in rats (Study N09067), supported by validation of methods to 
detect and quantify CT-P13, Remicade and antibody formation performed for GLP studies.    
Method of analysis  
Methods for detection of infliximab rat serum levels from exposure to CT-P13 and Remicade by ELISA 
methodology, and for the measurement of anti-CT-P13 antibody and anti-Remicade antibody 
concentration in rat serum by semi-quantitative ELISA assays were developed and validated for GLP 
studies.. 
Absorption 
Study N09067: single intravenous dose pharmacokinetics comparison study in rats 
In this study to compare the PK of CT-P13 and Remicade, a total of 20 male Sprague-Dawley rats received 
a single IV administration of CT-P13 or Remicade at a dose level of 10 or 50 mg/kg (5 rats/dose group). 
Serum samples were collected over 336 h after administration of CT-P13 or Remicade. CT-P13 or 
Remicade serum levels were quantified by an ELISA assay. The determination of comparability was based 
on comparison of the AUCt.  
No deaths were observed during the study. There were no treatment-related changes in the clinical 
observations. After a single IV administration of CT-P13, the serum concentrations of infliximab slowly 
declined in bi-exponential manner. The area under the serum concentration-time curve from the start of 
dosing to the time of last sampling (AUC0-t), the back extrapolated concentration at time zero (C0) and the 
maximum observed peak serum concentration (Cmax) increased in a dose-proportional manner with 
increasing dose between 10 to 50 mg/kg. The serum concentration-time profiles for CT-P13 and 
Remicade are shown below.

Mean serum concentrations of infliximab after intravenous administration of 
CT-P13 and Remicade in rats 
After a single dose IV administration of CT-P13 or Remicade at 10 and 50 mg/kg, the serum 
concentration-time profiles of CT-P13 and Remicade were similar. The geometric mean AUC0-t ratio of 
CT-P13 and Remicade was 96.66% (90% CI 79.69 to 117.23) at 10 mg/kg. At 50 mg/kg, the geometric

mean AUC0-t ratio of CT-P13 and Remicade® was 112.70% (90% CI 87.30 to 145.49). The PK parameters 
obtained from this study are summarised in the tables below

Distribution 
No distribution studies have been performed in line with the CHMP guideline on similar biological 
medicinal products containing monoclonal antibodies (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010). 
Metabolism and excretion 
No metabolism studies have been performed with CT-P13 in line with the CHMP guideline on similar 
biological medicinal products containing monoclonal antibodies (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010). 
Infliximab is composed of amino acids and carbohydrates like endogenous immunoglobulins, such that its 
metabolism and excretion will be the same as for normal immunoglobulin clearance pathways. 
PK drug interaction  
No studies assessing pharmacokinetic drug interactions have been performed with CT-P13 in line with the 
CHMP guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing monoclonal antibodies 
(EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010).

similar biological medicinal products containing monoclonal antibodies 
(EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010). 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Two 2-weeks repeat dose toxicity studies in rats were performed to compare off-target toxicity profiles 
of CT-P13 and Remicade. Initially, an exploratory dose-finding study was also performed with Remicade 
in rats to confirm dose selection of the comparative studies.

•  Study 8214167: 2-Week IV injection dose finding study with Remicade in rats 
In an initial study, non-GLP-compliant, toxicity and toxicokinetics (TK) of Remicade were evaluated in 5 
male and 5 female rats, aged 11 weeks old, who were dosed with a bolus IV injection of Remicade twice, 
on Day 1 and day 8 at doses of 0, 10 or 40 mg/kg. Controls were given 0.9% sodium chloride. Assessment 
of toxicity was based on mortality, clinical observations, body weight, food consumption, opthalmoscopy 
and pathology. All animals were sacrificed on day 15 and subject to necropsy. Further male and female 
rats were similarly dosed for TK evaluation.   
Dosage analyses indicated that test article concentrations were within 92.3-94.6% of nominal values. 
There were no unscheduled deaths in the toxicity study and Remicade was well-tolerated with only minor 
clinical abnormalities noted after dosing (e.g. hypoactivity and/or eye squinting). There was no toxicity 
noted on body weight, body weight changes or in food consumption. Slightly higher reticulocyte and 
platelet counts were noted in males at 40 mg/kg but were considered incidental. There were no findings 
indicating toxicity at necropsy and all abnormalities were judged incidental and not related to Remicade. 
The NOAEL was set at 40mg/kg. At this dose, Cmax values following dosing on day 8 were 1.2 mg/ml in 
males and 8.7 mg/ml in females and AUC values were 88.4 mgh/ml in males and 73.5 mgh/ml in females. 
Measures of exposure were approximately in proportion between the two doses 10 and 40 mg/kg and 
differences between males and females were less than 2-fold. Assay of serum samples for anti-infliximab 
antibodies was done. Of 84 test samples tested, there was one with a positive result, but this was from a 
pre-dose sample and a confirmatory test result was negative.   
•  Study 8214158: 2-Week repeat-dose IV toxicity and TK study with CT-P13 and Remicade 
in rats 
In this GLP-compliant study, 10 male and 10 female rats, aged 10-11 weeks old, were dosed by IV bolus 
injection with CT-P13 or Remicade on two occasions, one week apart at doses of doses 0, 10 or 40 mg/kg. 
Controls were given 0.9% sodium chloride. Assessment of toxicity was based on mortality, clinical 
observations, body weight, food consumption, ophthalmoscopy and pathology. Animals were sacrificed 
Inflectra  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589422/2013 
Page 41/105 
 
  
 
 
on day 15 and subject to necropsy. Further male and female rats were similarly dosed for TK evaluation. 
Also, blood was collected by cardiac puncture on day 15 after carbon dioxide anaesthesia.   
Dosage analyses indicated that test article concentrations were within 98.8-100 and 93.2-94.4% of 
nominal values for CT-P13 and for Remicade, respectively. There were no unscheduled deaths in the main 
toxicity study. In TK groups, one female at 10 mg/kg CT-P13 was found dead on day 4 after the 72 hour 
blood sample. This was not judged test-article-related. There were no clinical observations indicating 
toxicity and no toxic effects were seen on body weight, body weight change, except for a marginal 
decrease in body weight gain in females given 40 mg/kg CT-P13 compared to controls, nor in food intake, 
or at ophthalmoscopy. Whereas there were some changes in clinical pathology parameters, these were 
judged to be minor and not of toxicological importance. For instance, there was an increase in absolute 
reticulocyte counts at 40 mg/kg of each test article in males and also of platelets at this dose in females; 
haemoglobin was statistically different from controls but was elevated at 10 mg/kg CT-P13 (from 15.9 to 
16.4 g/dl) and was reduced at 40 mg/kg (from 15.9 to 15.5 g/dl). Such changes were not considered to 
be toxicologically significant and these had no correlated change in tissues on microscopic examination. 
At necropsy, there was an increase in the relative (to brain) weight of the uterus in females given 40 
mg/kg CT-P13 and in females given 10 mg/kg Remicade but this was attributed to normal variation. 
There were occasional findings on microscopic examination, but these were all attributed to normal 
biological variation. Minimal Kupffer cell hyperplasia was present in 2/10 and in 7/10 males given 10 or 
40 mg/kg CT-P13 and was present in 2/10 and in  6/10 females at these doses; however, this was also 
present in 4 and 3/10 males and females and 7 and 7/10 males and females at 10 and 40 mg/kg 
Remicade. This was likely test-article-related but was not adverse due to minimal severity. There was also 
individual lymphocyte necrosis in the thymus of rats given either dose of either test article. This reflected 
normal biological variation but also a test-article-related effect cannot be ruled out. Injection sites were 
examined and a minimal degree of inflammation was commonly reported but this was no more common 
in those given the active agents than in controls. In conclusion, it was determined that the no observed 
adverse effect level (NOAEL) was 40 mg/kg for both CT-P13 and Remicade and that the effects were 
similar for both test articles.  
•  Study G09197: 2-Week IV dose toxicity comparison study in rats (CT-P13 and Remicade) 
In a second GLP-compliant study, 10 male and 10 female rats, aged 6-7 weeks old, were dosed 
intravenously with CT-P13 or with Remicade on two occasions, one week apart at doses of doses 0, 10 or 
50 mg/kg. Controls were given 0.9% sodium chloride. Assessment of toxicity was based on the same 
parameters as previous study and animals were sacrificed on day 15 and subject to necropsy. Further 
male and female rats were similarly dosed for TK evaluation. Also, blood was collected by cardiac 
puncture on day 15 after carbon dioxide anaesthesia.   
There were no unscheduled deaths. Transient subdued behaviour was noted at 50 mg/kg of each teat 
article. There were no changes in body weight or in the change in body weight over the monitoring period, 
although there was a reduction in food intake at 50 mg/kg of each of CT-P13 and Remicade. There were 
no abnormalities noted in ophthalmological examination, or on urinalysis. In haematology, there were 
increases in reticulocytes (1.27 – 1.46 fold) and in platelets (1.22-1.24) at 50 mg/kg of each test article. 
Decreases in creatinine kinase were found (to 0.64-0.68 fold) at 50 mg/kg of each test article. At post 
mortem examination, there were increases in the relative liver weight (1.09-1.11 fold) of females at 50 
mg/kg of each test article and also an increase in absolute liver weight (1.12-1.13 fold) of females given 
either 10 or 50 mg/kg Remicade. There were no abnormalities on histopathological examination 
attributed to treatment with either test article. No differences in toxicity between CT-P13 and Remicade 
were detected. All treatment-related changes described above including clinical signs, food consumption, 
haematology, serum biochemistry, and organ weights showed similar patterns in the animals given 
Inflectra  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589422/2013 
Page 42/105 
 
  
 
CT-P13 and Remicade at both, 10 and 50 mg/kg/dose. It was concluded that the NOAELs for CT-P13 and 
Remicade were both 50 mg/kg/dose, with comparable findings observed for both test articles. 
Genotoxicity  
No genotoxicity studies have been performed. The CHMP guidance on similar biological medicinal 
products (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005) states that other routine toxicological studies such as 
mutagenicity (genotoxicity) and carcinogenicity are not required for similar biological medicinal products, 
unless indicated by results of repeat-dose studies. The CHMP guidance on similar biological medicinal 
products containing monoclonal antibodies states that mutagenicity (genotoxicity) studies are not 
routinely required (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010). Large proteins, such as monoclonal antibodies, are 
not expected to pass through cell membranes and interact directly with DNA or other chromosomal 
material. In addition, as data obtained from the repeat-dose toxicity studies have not indicated any cause 
for concern, it is considered that genotoxicity and/or carcinogenicity studies are not necessary for this 
product.  
Carcinogenicity  
Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed in line with the CHMP guidance on similar biological 
medicinal products containing monoclonal antibodies (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010), which states 
that carcinogenicity studies are not routinely required and should only be performed for cause. The CHMP 
guidance on similar biological medicinal products (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005) also states that 
routine toxicological studies such as carcinogenicity are not required for similar biological medicinal 
products. There is no cause for concern from previous animal studies conducted. The SmPC for CT-P13 
addresses malignancies/cancer development in man in line with the SmPC of Remicade. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have not been performed. The CHMP Guideline on 
similar biological medicinal products containing monoclonal antibodies (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/ 403543/2010) 
states that reproduction toxicity studies are not routine requirements for non-clinical testing of similar 
biological medicinal products containing monoclonal antibodies as active substances.  Likewise, the CHMP 
guidance on biosimilar medicinal products (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005) states that routine 
toxicological studies, such as reproduction and developmental toxicology are not required. 
Toxicokinetic data 
TK analysis from study 8214158 showed exposure to CT-P13 and Remicade increased with the increase 
in dose level from 10 to 40 mg/kg/dose. Increases in C0, Cmax, and AUC0-168 after dosing with CT-P13 or 
Remicade were generally dose proportional and sex differences were less than 2-fold. Potential 
accumulation of CT-P13 and Remicade was observed after the second dose. CT-P13 to Remicade ratios for 
Cmax and AUC0-168 values are presented below; in all cases, values for CT-P13 are lower than those for 
Remicade.

When compared to Remicade, CT-P13 Cmax and AUC0-168 values were generally 8.40% to 24.1% and 
6.70% to 35.4% lower at the 10 and 40 mg/kg dose levels, respectively. However, these lower results 
appear to be caused by the mean concentration-time data from a composite profile being used in the TK 
parameter calculation in this study (3 rats/timepoint rather than sampling the same individuals over the 
full monitoring period); these data were limited due to a sparse nature of TK sampling. 
Nine animals/sex assigned to each dose group of CT-P13 or Remicade for the TK study were divided into 
3 sub-groups for blood sampling at each time interval. Blood samples were taken from each sub-group, 
3 animals/sex, and the mean serum concentration at each sampling time point was used to calculate the 
TK parameter. Due to this kind of TK sampling approach, only one value of TK parameters for each dose 
group of CT-P13 or Remicade could be calculated. As a result, the TK study result was thought to have 
excessive variation. This was confirmed when comparing TK parameters obtained from the animals 
treated with the same batch and dose levels of Remicade in 2 TK studies (Study 8214167 and 8214158) 
because the ratio of Cmax and AUC0-168 for the same Remicade dose varies from 103.6% to 149.6% and 
104.8% to 132.1% respectively over the sex, dose levels and dosing phases from the studies. 
Local Tolerance   
No separate local tolerance studies have been performed. Histopathological assessments of local 
(injection site) tolerance were carried-out in the repeat-dose toxicity studies. In Study 8214158, there 
were no toxicologically significant differences in injection site findings between control animals and the 
animals at the high doses of CT-P13 and Remicade (injection sites of the low doses were not 
histopathologically examined). In Study G09197, there were no injection site findings in control animals 
and in the animals at high doses of CT-P13 and Remicade (injection sites of the low doses were not 
histopathologically examined). This is in line with the CHMP guideline on similar biological medicinal 
products containing monoclonal antibodies (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010) which states that studies 
on local tolerance are usually not required and that if other in vivo studies are performed, evaluation of 
local tolerance may be part of the design of that study instead of the performance of separate local 
tolerance studies. 
Other toxicity studies 
Studies into dependence, metabolites, and impurities have not been performed. Immunogenicity of 
CT-P13 in comparison with Remicade was assessed as part of the 2-week repeat-dose toxicity study 
8214158 in rats. The formation of the antibodies against CT-P13 and Remicade was assessed in 167 
samples in total. The results showed that no anti-infliximab antibodies were detected in animals that 
received either CT-P13 or Remicade. Based on these data, no further evaluation for neutralising 
antibodies was conducted. No other toxicity studies have been conducted. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No environmental risk assessment was performed in line with the CHMP Guideline on the environmental 
risk assessment of medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) which states that 
proteins are exempted from the need for an assessment of impact on the environment because they are 
unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. CT-P 13 is a monoclonal antibody and is a protein; 
therefore an environmental risk assessment is not required for this medicinal product

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamics study package consisted of in vitro studies assessing the binding affinity of 
CT-P13 (and Remicade) to soluble monomeric and trimeric form of TNFα and transmembrane form of 
TNFα, TNFβ, FcγRI, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIIa, FcRn and C1q; the TNFα neutralisation activity; the complement –
dependent cytotoxic (CDC), antibody-mediated cytotoxic (ADCC) and apoptotic effects; and the 
cross-reactivity with various human tissues. Thus, in accordance with CHMP Guideline 
EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010, this testing addressed binding to the target antigen, binding to Fcγ 
receptors, FcRn and complement, Fab-associated properties of functional neutralisation and 
Fc-associated properties (ADCC, CDC and complement activation). 
All comparative in vitro primary pharmacodynamics studies results between CT-P13 and Remicade are 
discussed in the quality section 2 of this report. In summary, In terms of the binding affinity to TNFα, 
equilibrium dissociation constant KD assessed by ELISA and the kinetics assessed by SPR for soluble 
monomeric and trimeric TNFα, CT-P13 and Remicade were comparable showing nearly identical KD 
values. Other studies assessing the binding affinity to the monomeric and trimeric forms of TNFα and 
transmembrane TNFα, show comparable results for CT-P13 drug product and Remicade. Comparable 
binding affinities to FcγRI, FcγRIIa and FcRn were shown. A difference in the binding affinity to the 
FcγRIIIa was seen with the CT-P13 as compared to the RemicadeThe identified difference in FcγRIIIa 
binding was further investigated during the procedure and is discussed in the quality section 2 of this 
report under biological activity and in the clinical section 3 under extrapolation of efficacy and safety.  
The Applicant did not present any data on secondary pharmacology, safety pharmacology or 
pharmacodynamic drug-drug interactions. This is consistent with CHMP guidance on similar biological 
medicinal products containing monoclonal antibodies (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010). 
Pharmacokinetics 
Comparative PK between CT-P13 and Remicade was evaluated in the single IV dose study N09067 in rats 
at two dose levels, 10 and 50 mg/kg. The methods to detect and quantify CT-P13, Remicade were 
appropriately validated. Method validations were performed in compliance with the GLP. Comparability 
was evaluated based on the ratio of the geometric means of the area under the curve. Following a single 
IV injection of CT-P13 or Remicade, the serum concentration slowly declined generally in a bi-exponential 
manner and the AUCt and Cmax increased in a dose-proportional manner with increasing dose from 10 to 
50 mg/kg. The geometric mean AUC0-t ratio of CT-P13 compared to Remicade at 10 and 50 mg/kg were 
96.66 (90% CI 79.69 to 117.23) and 112.70% (90% CI 87.30 to 145.49) respectively. The observed 
variability is reasonably linked to the small sample size used (a human bioequivalence study would not 
use as small a number as 5 per group). Although hampered by methodological limitations, the other PK 
parameters [Cmax, Tmax, MRTt] also showed similar results for the two formulations. Overall, a difference 
in the PK of CT-P13 and Remicade after IV administration at doses of 10 and 50 mg/kg is not suggested 
and it can be concluded the PK of CT-P13 after IV administration at doses of 10 and 50 mg/kg are similar 
to those of Remicade. 
The absence of studies into distribution, metabolism, excretion and PK drug-drug interactions is 
consistent with CHMP guidance on similar biological medicinal products containing monoclonal antibodies 
(EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010). 
Toxicology 
Three repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats were performed to evaluate the safety of CT-P13. Due to the 
lack of cross-reactivity of infliximab with any species other than chimpanzee or human, these studies 
Inflectra  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589422/2013 
Page 45/105 
 
  
were performed to compare general off-target product toxicity (including immunogenicity) of CT-P13 with 
Remicade. Studies in species other than chimpanzee are not capable of identifying target-related toxicity. 
Study 8214167 was a pilot exploratory dose-finding study performed with Remicade in rats which 
confirmed that a dose level up to 40 mg/kg given IV, on two occasions, one week apart did not reveal any 
significant adverse effects and therefore would be suitable for further testing. The study was not 
comparative in nature and did not involve CT-P13. Two GLP-compliant repeat dose toxicity studies 
8214158 and G09197 were then performed in rats dosed intravenously with either CT-P13 or Remicade 
at 0, 10 or 40 mg/kg (study 8214158) and at 0, 10 or 50 mg/kg (study G09197). In both studies, two 
doses were given one week apart. No significant test-article related findings were noted in any of the 
studies. In the first study, minimally higher absolute reticulocyte count in males and mildly higher platelet 
count in males and females at 40 mg/kg/dose CT-P13 or Remicade, as well as minimal Kupffer cell 
hyperplasia in livers at 10 and 40 mg/kg/dose CT-P13 or Remicade were observed. However, the changes 
were of similar magnitude for both test articles. The NOAELs for CT-P13 and Remicade were both 
40 mg/kg/dose infliximab. In the second study, subdued behaviour, decreases in food consumption, 
changes in creatine kinase, and albumin/globulin ratio, increases in platelets and reticulocytes (%), total 
protein and female liver weights were observed. The findings were comparable for CT-P13 and Remicade. 
The NOAELs for both products were the same 50 mg/kg/dose. In terms of off-target toxicity CT-P13 can 
be considered biosimilar to Remicade. However, due to the lack of primary pharmacodynamic activity in 
rats, toxicity testing conducted was not relevant to judging comparability between CT-P13 and Remicade 
or to predicting safety in human. 
Immunogenicity analysis from study 8214158 showed that none of the serum samples from treated 
animals were positive with antibodies to CT-P13 or Remicade.TK results from the study indicated that 
animals were almost continuously exposed to CT-P13 or Remicade throughout the study. Exposure to 
CT-P13 and Remicade increased with the increase in dose level from 10 to 40 mg/kg/dose. Increases in 
C0, Cmax, and AUC0-168 after dosing with CT-P13 or Remicade were generally dose proportional and sex 
differences were less than 2-fold. 
The absence of testing for single dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity and reproduction toxicity is 
acceptable and consistent with CHMP guidance on similar biological medicinal products containing 
monoclonal antibodies (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010). Local tolerance at the injection sites was 
evaluated in the repeat-dose toxicity studies following 2 weekly IV injections of CT-P13 or Remicade. No 
irritation or other injection site reactions were noted with either of the products. However, instead of the 
final formulation intended for clinical use a saline vehicle for CT-P13 and Remicade was used. Hence, no 
conclusions on clinical tolerability of the final drug product formulation can be made based on these 
animal data. However, CT-P13 seemed well tolerated in clinical use, and there is no need for additional 
local tolerance study.  
An environmental risk assessment is not required  according to the CHMP guidance on the environmental 
risk assessment of medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 1) as CT-P13 is a 
protein and proteins are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In accordance with the Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing monoclonal 
antibodies (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010) and biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance; 
non-clinical and clinical issues (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005) and with ICH guideline S6 (RI)–
preclinical safety evaluation of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals Step 5 
(EMA/CHMP/ICH/731268/1998), the Applicant has performed state-of-the-art comparative 
characterisation studies between CT-P13 and Remicade.

The pharmacological study package is considered adequate and thorough. The comparability of the 
CT-P13 drug to the reference medicinal product was shown in the majority of parameters assessed. Some 
variability was seen in the results which is acceptable. All comparative in vitro primary 
pharmacodynamics studies results were presented and discussed in the quality section of this report. The 
difference observed in FcγRIIIa binding was further discussed and analysed in the quality and clinical 
section of this report. Overall it was concluded that this observation does not impact the biological activity 
(when conditions more representative of the in vivo situation are used) and, with a high level of 
probability, has no clinically relevant impact of the efficacy and safety of CT-P13.  
Study N09067 was the only comparative single dose PK study performed in rats with CT-P13 and 
Remicade, each at either 10 or 50 mg/kg given IV. The geometric mean AUC0-t ratio of CT-P13 compared 
to Remicade at 10 and 50 mg/kg were 96.66 (90% CI 79.69 to 117.23) and 112.70% (90% CI 87.30 to 
145.49) respectively. The degree of variability showed may be attributed to the small sample used in 
each group. Overall, the PK of CT-P13 and Remicade after IV administration in rats at doses of 10 and 
50 mg/kg are considered similar. Repeat dose toxicity evaluation in the non-responsive species rat 
revealed no significant test-article related off-target toxicity. The minimal treatment related findings 
were of similar magnitude and frequency with both CT-P13 and Remicade. In terms of off-target toxicity 
CT-P13 can be considered biosimilar to Remicade.  However, as infliximab is not active in rats, these 
studies are not relevant for predicting human safety and are of little relevance for determining 
biosimilarity. Overall, there appear to have no difference in PK in rats between CT-P13 and Remicade as 
well as in relation to general toxicity.  
The absence of other types of testing (secondary and safety pharmacology, distribution, metabolism, 
excretion, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity and to reproductive function) is agreed as is the absence of an 
assessment of risk to the environment. The lack of these data is acceptable and consistent with CHMP 
guidelines. Sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC for CT-P13 reflect the same information as for Remicade. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The clinical development programme to show biosimilarity between CT-P13 and Remicade consists in two 
pivotal trials: 
•  Study CT-P13 1.1: a comparative  pharmacokinetic (PK) study in patients with AS 
•  Study CT-P13 3.1: a study comparing the efficacy and safety of CT-P13 and Remicade in patients 
with active RA. 
These 2 studies were planned with a 1-year treatment duration. In both case the primary endpoints were 
assessed at 30 weeks (when the 6th infusion was administered). Results at Week 30 served as basis to 
support this application. During the assessment the Applicant submitted further efficacy and safety data 
up to 54 weeks. 
A third study (CT-P13 1.2) in RA patients was a small pilot study performed primarily to facilitate the 
conduct of the pivotal trial CT-P13 3.1. It was on-going (up to 2 years of treatment) at the time of this 
procedure. 
The same study product was used in the three clinical studies. Supplies of the reference product Remicade 
were sourced from 15 batches in the EU with manufacture dates ranging from September 2009 to 
September 2011.

GCP 
The clinical trials were conducted in accordance with GCP as claimed by the Applicant. The Applicant has 
provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out 
in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. In the study CT-P13 1.1 and 3.1 one 
centre was closed due to a suspected misconduct. The data from this centre were excluded from the 
statistical analyses. 
A request for a routine GCP inspection (INS/GCP/2012/11) was adopted by the CHMP for the following 
clinical study: CT–P13 3.1: a randomised, double – blind, parallel – group, phase III study to demonstrate 
equivalence in efficacy and safety of CT–P13 compared with Remicade when co-administered with 
methotrexate in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. The inspections took place at three 
investigators’ sites. Based on the GCP inspection findings, the CHMP concluded that the study had been 
conducted in compliance with GCP at these sites. Overall, the CHMP considered that the patients in this 
study had received acceptable information about the conduct of the study and that the subjects were well 
taken care of by the professional study team. No critical findings were identified during the inspections 
and it is the opinion of the CHMP that the data documented and reported in the study are credible and can 
be used for evaluation and assessment of the application.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Introduction  
The PK profile of CT-P13 was investigated in the 3 above-mentioned clinical studies and compared with 
that of Remicade. Immunogenicity was also monitored in all 3 clinical studies. The studies were 
randomised, double-blind, parallel-group and comparator-controlled studies. In accordance with the 
Inflectra  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589422/2013 
Page 48/105 
 
  
 
 
 
 
guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing monoclonal antibodies, the primary objective 
of PK studies was to show comparability in PK of CT-P13 with Remicade in a sensitive and homogeneous 
population.  
Analytical methods 
The serum concentrations of infliximab were measured using a validated sandwich immunoassay. 
Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were determined with an electrochemiluminescent (ECL) immunoassay 
method. The same assay using Remicade as the immunocompetition anti-TNF was initially used to detect 
antibodies to both Remicade and CT-P13. As this was not endorsed by the CHMP, the Applicant re-tested 
samples from both treatment arms with the same assay using tagged CT-P13. A very high concordance 
between the results of the two assays was demonstrated, and thus, the two assays can be considered as 
interchangeable. Neutralising anti-drug antibodies against CT-P13 and Remicade were measured with a 
competitive ligand binding assay. This method is adequately justified by available literature suggesting 
that B-cell epitopes of infliximab are mainly or solely located at its Fab region. 
Pivotal PK Study CT-P13 1.1  
Methods 
Study CT-P13 1.1: randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, phase 1 study to demonstrate the 
equivalence with respect to the PK profile of CT-P13 and Remicade in patients with AS.  
In this multicentre study, AS patients received a 2 h IV infusion of either CT-P13 (5 mg/kg) or Remicade 
(5 mg/kg) at Weeks 0, 2, and 6 and then once every 8 weeks up to Week 54 (Weeks 14, 22, 30, 38, 46, 
54). This corresponds to 3 loading doses and 6 maintenance doses. The first 3 doses of the maintenance 
phase were blinded and at Week 30, the study was unblinded for reporting purposes and efficacy, PK, PD 
and safety endpoints were evaluated; the study remained blinded to the investigators and patients up to 
Week 54. Details on the study participants are given under section 2.4.3 of this report. 
Figure 4  
CT-P13 1.1 study design 
Blood samples for determination of infliximab concentration were taken for each dose at three time points 
(pre-dose, within 15 min after the end of infusion and 1 hour after the end of infusion) with additional 
samples after Dose 5 (after 8 and 24 hours, then on Days 8, 15, 29, 43, 57). Blood samples for 
determination of antibodies were taken at screening, Weeks 14, 30, 54 and at the end of study (EOS) visit 
(8 weeks after the last dose). 
The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate comparable PK of CT-P13 and Remicade at steady 
state (between Weeks 22 and 30). 
The primary parameters were AUCτ and Cmax i.e. after Dose 5 (Weeks 22–30). The main secondary 
parameters were average concentration at steady state (Cav,ss), Cmin,ss, terminal elimination half-life

(T1/2), total body clearance at steady state (CLss) and volume of distribution at steady state (Vss). Other 
parameters were observed maximum serum concentrations (Cmax), minimum concentration immediately 
before the next dose (Cmin) and time to reach Cmax (Tmax) after each dose. 
The PK population consisted of all patients who received at least the first 5 doses of study treatment and 
provided an end of infusion sample and at least 1 post-treatment PK sample. The PK population included 
only patients who received the study treatment to which they were randomly assigned and did not have 
any major protocol deviations, including a deviation of sampling time at the end of the infusion for Dose 
5. Additional analyses compared the results in patients who did not develop antibodies to infliximab 
during the whole study period (antibody negative subset) and those who did (antibody positive subset).

Results 
Subject disposition  
A total of 370 patients were screened and 250 patients were randomised (125 patients in each treatment 
arms) and treated. At Week 30, the majority of patients in each treatment arm were continuing in the 
study (113 [90.4%] patients and 116 [92.8%] patients in the CT-P13 and Remicade treatment arms, 
respectively. 
Table 14  Patient disposition in Study CT-P13 1.1 
The PK population consisted of 222 patients, i.e. 112 (89.6%) for CT-P13 and 110 (88.0%) for Remicade.  
Demographic characteristics 
Demographic characteristics and disease activity index are summarized below. The study patients were 
young (mean age of 39 years) and mostly male (81%). The majority of patients (75%) had a baseline 
BASDAI score of <8. Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar in the two treatment arms.

Secondary PK analysis 
For the main secondary PK parameters after Dose 5, including half-life, clearance, volume of distribution, 
the 90% CIs of the geometric mean ratios also lied within the 80% - 125% limits, which further supports 
the similar PK behaviour of both products. 
The ratio (%) of the geometric means for Cmax ranged from 90.67 to 108.58 following Doses 1 to 9. 
Although this ratio was greater than 100 after most doses (i.e. higher Cmax for CT-P13 than Remicade) the 
90%CI remained within the 80 - 125% limits for all doses. A small positive correlation between Cmax and 
infusion rate could be observed for both treatments but there was no statistical difference in the infusion 
rate of CT-P13 and Remicade. The ratio of the geometric means for Cmin ranged from 93.89 to 113.95. 
Despite Cmin being much more variable than Cmax, the 90%CI included 100% at all time points indicating 
no difference between the treatment arms. The median Tmax values were also comparable in the two 
treatment arms.

Immunogenicity results 
The results were initially presented at screening, Weeks 14 and 30. Following CHMP request, 
immunogenicity data were extended (up to week 54) and completed with antibody titres. Overall, 44/128 
patients (34.4%) in the CT-P13 arm and 39/122 patients (32.0%) in the Remicade arm reported at least 
one positive ADA immunogenicity test result (i.e. seroconverted) at any time point up to week 54. 
Although most patients had seroconverted by week 30, 7/44 patients (16%) in the CT-P13 arm and 11/39 
patients (28%) in the Remicade arm seroconverted later. 
Almost all antibodies were found to be neutralising, which is expected considering the mouse 
(Fab)-human chimeric nature of infliximab. Comparable ADA and NAb titres were observed over time in 
both treatment arms. The distribution of the patients by neutralising antibody category (defined 
according to the tertiles of pooled data from all patients and all visits) is shown in the table below. There 
was a slight trend for increased antibody titres over time, which was similar in both treatment arms.

Additional analyses according to patient antibody (ADA) status were provided, which demonstrated that 
the presence of antibodies significantly reduced systemic exposure to infliximab by increasing its 
clearance and decreasing its half-life, volume of distribution, and serum concentrations. However, the 
magnitude of the impact of ADAs on the PK parameters was comparable between both treatments as 
reflected in the tables below.

Study CT-P13 3.1  
Methods 
Supportive PK data were generated from the pivotal efficacy trial, which was designed to show 
therapeutic equivalence of CT-P13 and Remicade. PK parameters were included as secondary endpoints. 
Blood samples were taken at each dose as in the pivotal PK study (without additional sampling after Dose 
5) and the same PK parameters were estimated. The study treatment was the same as in the pivotal PK 
trial except for the dose, 3 mg/kg. In addition, MTX (12.5 to 25 mg/week oral or parenteral) with folate 
was co-administered.

As previously seen in study CT-P13 1.1, the development of ADA antibodies had a significant impact on 
peak and trough concentrations, which were lower in the antibody-positive subset of patients compared 
to the antibody-negative subset. This impact was similar in both treatment arms. 
Study CT-P13 1.2  
Study CT-P13 1.2 is a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, Phase I study to evaluate the initial 
pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of CT-P13 compared with Remicade when co-administered with 
methotrexate in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. 
Methods 
The study was designed to provide preliminary data on PK, PD, efficacy and safety of multiple doses of 
CT-P13 compared to Remicade (3 mg/kg) administered by a 2 h IV infusion when co-administered with 
MTX (between 12.5 to 25 mg/week, oral dose) and folic acid (≥5 mg/kg/week, oral dose) in patients with 
active RA. The primary objective was to demonstrate comparable Cmax and PK profiles between CT-P13 
and Remicade in patients with active RA at Weeks 0, 2 and 6. 
The total duration was up to 112 week. At Week 6 the study was unblinded for reporting purposes and PK 
endpoints and preliminary safety endpoints were evaluated; the study remained blinded to the 
investigators and patients up to Week 54. At Week 30, secondary endpoints, i.e. efficacy, PK, PD, and 
safety were assessed. This study is on-going. The patient selection criteria were similar to those of Study 
CT-P13 3.1.  
Results 
In total 19 patients were randomised: 9 to CT-P13 and 10 to Remicade. Values of Cmax at Doses 1, 2 and 
3 (Weeks 0, 2 and 6) were comparable. Mean Cmax for the CT-P13 arm ranged from 76.1 to 84.8 μg/mL 
and mean Cmax for the Remicade arm from 64.6 to 78.3 μg/mL. 
This study was also used to evaluate the fate of the infliximab C-terminal lysine variants. Blood samples 
were taken from 8 patients (5 treated with CT-P13 and 3 treated with Remicade) immediately and 1 h 
post infusion following Doses 1, 3 and 6. Samples were pooled for each time point and assayed for 
C-terminal lysine content. C-terminal lysine was not detected in most samples with only minor levels 
being detected in samples from patients treated with CT-P13 Dose 1, namely 3.1% and 0.4%

immediately and 1 h post infusion, respectively. This indicates rapid cleavage of the C-terminal lysine 
residues in blood following administration. 
Relevance of the PK results to all approved indications 
Remicade is approved in several indications in inflammatory diseases, including RA, AS, PsA, adults and 
paediatric CD, adults and paediatric UC and Ps. Study CT-P13 1.1 designed to demonstrate PK 
equivalence of CT-P13 and Remicade was conducted in patients with AS. In accordance with the guideline 
on similar biological medicinal products containing monoclonal antibodies 
(EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010), the primary objective of PK studies performed to support a MAA for a 
similar biological medicinal product is to show comparability in PK of the biosimilar with the reference 
product in a sufficiently sensitive and homogeneous population. Patients with AS were considered as a 
sensitive population, because these patients are generally young, otherwise healthy and not receiving 
concomitant medication such as MTX, which has been shown to have an effect on anti-infliximab antibody 
status and thus on infliximab clearance (Xu et al. 2008). Furthermore, the available data and published 
literature on Remicade indicate that there are no significant differences in PK profiles for Remicade in 
patients with RA, adult and paediatric CD, and Ps (Klotz et al. 2007, Nestorov 2005) and there are no data 
to indicate that the PK profile in these three indications differ from the PK profile in AS patients. Also, 
infliximab serum levels in paediatric patients with CD were similar to those in adult CD patients. 
A recent retrospective analysis of data from 2 phase III clinical trials in CD patients found that age did not 
influence infliximab PK in the range of 6 – 76 years (Fasanmade et al. 2011).  Although the balance of 
data report similarities for infliximab PK profiles in different patient populations, it is noted that some 
studies report differences but these are attributed to differences in immunological responses in different 
populations. For example, the systemic clearance of infliximab was reported to be similar in patients with 
AS and RA (0.27 L/day), but lower than in patients with CD (0.36 L/day). In this PK study, it was 
concluded that of all the covariates evaluated, it was anti-infliximab antibody status that had the most 
significant influence on infliximab clearance being associated with accelerated clearance (Xu et al. 2008). 
Differences in PK were also reported between patients receiving co-administration of MTX and patients 
who did not receive MTX. In an interaction study, the plasma concentrations of infliximab were found to 
be slightly increased by MTX.  
Absorption  
CT-P13 is intended for IV administration and consequently, bioavailability studies are not needed. 
Distribution  
The mean Vss for CT-P13 was calculated to be 3788.85 mL ~3.8 L, similar to that of the reference product 
Remicade (median Vss of 3.0-4.1 L in the Remicade SmPC) indicating that infliximab is predominantly 
distributed within the vascular compartment.  
Elimination 
There are no specific studies regarding the metabolism or excretion of infliximab in humans. It is expected 
that infliximab is eliminated in a similar manner as native antibodies. 
Dose proportionality  
Dose-proportionality was not evaluated. In the clinical studies, the study products were administered at 
the recommended therapeutic dose, i.e. 5 mg/kg in AS and 3 mg/kg in RA.

Special populations 
No studies were performed in patients with hepatic impairment and in patients with renal impairment as 
these are not required for a similar biological medicinal product.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No PK interaction studies were performed as these are not required for a similar biological medicinal 
product.    
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
CT-P13  contains  infliximab,  a  chimeric  (i.e.  contains  human  constant  and  murine  variable  regions) 
immunoglobin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds with high affinity to the human tumour 
necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). 
Mechanism of action 
Most studies on the mechanisms of action of TNF antagonists have been performed in RA. A few studies 
have been conducted in other rheumatic diseases, such as AS, JIA or PsA. Initial data suggest that the 
effects of TNF blockade on synovial inflammation are comparable in different forms of arthritis. Biopsy 
studies from patients with RA, CD and Ps suggest that TNFα antagonists share many common 
mechanisms of action across these diseases (Tracey et al. 2008). 
Infliximab acts by binding to and neutralising soluble TNFα (sTNF) and membrane bound TNFα (tmTNF), 
preventing TNF from binding to its receptor (TNFR) and inducing associated cellular functions. When TNF 
antagonists bind to tmTNF, they inhibit its binding to the TNF receptor (TNFR) on the surface of cells such 
as human T-cells and rheumatoid synovial macrophages, and in lamina propria bowel wall T cells in CD. 
They may also induce a direct effect upon the tmTNF-bearing cells such as apoptosis, cytokine 
suppression, complement-dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. 
As part of the nonclinical development programme as well as the pharmaceutical comparability exercise 
of CT-P13, an extensive battery of in vitro tests comparing CT-P13 to Remicade was conducted. These 
tests covered investigations of the binding affinity of CT-P13 and Remicade for human TNFα, for soluble 
human TNFα in trimeric and monomeric forms, for tmTNF-Jurkat cells, Fcγ receptors (FcγRI, FcγRII, FcRn 
and FcγRIIIa), and to C1q, as well as cross reactivity to a panel of 40 human tissues in a GLP-compliant 
immunohistochemical study. All these tests found that CT-P13 and Remicade display comparable activity. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
No direct pharmacodynamic effects can be attributed to anti-TNFs in patients. The pharmacodynamic 
endpoints studied in the pivotal efficacy trial (CT-P13 3.1) are markers of disease activity and do not have 
a clear relationship to therapeutic effect. These markers included C-reactive protein (CRP), rheumatoid 
factor (RF), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and antibodies against cyclic citrullinated peptide 
(anti-CCP) concentration. These PD parameters were discussed as part of the scientific advice procedure 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/788791/2009). Statistical analyses (ANCOVA) of anti-CCP, CRP, ESR, IgA RF, IgG RF, 
and IgM RF are summarised below for the PD population.

Given the distribution of these parameters, their evolution is better described by the median changes 
from baseline, which appeared quite similar in both treatment arms. Although these parameters cannot 
be considered as markers of the therapeutic response, their evolution suggests a similar decrease in the 
disease activity under treatment with the test or reference products. 
There was no change in anti-CCP levels up to Week 30; the median change from baseline was zero in both 
treatment arms. Baseline CRP levels ranged between 0.02 and 20.8 mg/dL with a median of 1.08 and 
1.10 in the CT-P13 and Remicade arms, respectively. A rapid decrease was seen in both treatment arms 
with a median change from baseline of -0.4 mg/dL at Week 30. Likewise, a rapid decline in ESR was 
observed after the first dose, which remained more or less unchanged after the second dose up to Week 
30 (median change of -16.0 and -17.0 mm/h in the CT-P13 and Remicade arms, respectively). 
In general, individual changes in RF were highly variable in both directions. For IgA RF, the median 
change was marginal at Week 30 (-2.6 and -2.0 IU/mL in the CT-P13 and Remicade arms, respectively). 
A progressive decrease was observed for IgG RF and IgM RF; the median decrease at Week 30 was similar 
in both treatment arms: -11. 2 and -9.1 IU/mL in the CT-P13 and Remicade arms, respectively, for IgG 
RF; -16. 1 and -15.9 IU/mL in the CT-P13 and Remicade arms, respectively, for IgM RF. 
In term of secondary pharmacology, the tolerability of CT-P13 and Remicade infusions was monitored. 
Infusion reactions are described in the adverse event sections. There were no differences between the 
two treatments with regard to the pulse rate, blood pressure or ventilation rate. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The design of the large comparative multiple dose trial conducted in AS patients (Study CT-P13 1.1) was 
endorsed as the pivotal PK trial by a CHMP scientific advice. Due to the long half-life and immunogenicity 
of infliximab, a parallel group design was considered appropriate and allowed the comparison of the PK 
and immunogenicity of CT-P13 and Remicade in a sensitive patient population as already mentioned. The 
assay formats employed by the Applicant for the measurement of infliximab and anti-infliximab 
antibodies were considered acceptable. 
A total of 250 patients were randomised and the PK population consisted of 222 patients (112 for CT-P13 
and 110 for Remicade). The co-primary PK endpoints were set as AUCτ and Cmax,ss between Weeks 22 and 
30. The 90% CIs of the geometric means ratios for both AUCτ and Cmax,ss lied between 93% and 116%, 
well contained within the standard bioequivalence interval of 80%-125%; this demonstrates that the PK 
of infliximab is equivalent between CT-P13 and Remicade at the dose of 5 mg/kg. Furthermore, 
equivalent PK was also shown in the antibody-negative subset of the patient population. The main 
secondary PK endpoints such as Tmax, Cmin,ss, T½, CLss, Vss between Weeks 22 and 30, as well as Cmax and 
Cmin after the 9 treatment doses, were also comparable in the CT-P13 and Remicade treatment arms in 
the PK population and its antibody-negative subset, providing further evidence of a similar PK behaviour.

Supportive PK data were generated in the pivotal study CT-P13 3.1 providing estimates of C min, Cmax, and 
Tmax in RA patients. The PK population consisted of 578 patients, i.e. 290 for CT-P13 and 288 for 
Remicade. Generally, peak and trough levels measured after the 9 treatment doses of 3 mg/kg were 
similar between CT-P13 and Remicade arms. 
Infliximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody known to be highly immunogenic with consequences on its 
PK, safety, and efficacy. The immunogenicity profile of CT-P13 has been well characterised in the two 
clinical studies CT-P13 1.1 and CT-P13 3.1. Over the 54-week treatment period, a generally similar 
proportion of patients developed anti-infliximab antibodies (ADA) in the two treatment arms: 34.4% 
(CT-P13) vs. 32.0% (Remicade) in the AS study CT-P13 1.1 and 55.6% (CT-P13) vs. 54.3% (Remicade) 
in the RA study CT-P13 3.1. Essentially, all these antibodies were found to be neutralising (Nabs). 
Antibody titres of ADA and Nabs increased slightly over time up to 30 weeks and no marked differences 
were observed between the two treatment arms. As expected, these antibodies significantly reduced the 
systemic exposure to infliximab in both clinical studies but their impact appeared generally comparable in 
the two treatment arms. 
Based on the review of the literature provided by the Applicant, there is no evidence of notable differences 
in the PK of infliximab across its various indications. With the two studies in AS and RA, the Applicant has 
covered the two recommended doses of infliximab (3 and 5 mg/kg). Moreover, data have been generated 
both in monotherapy and in combination with MTX. Therefore, from a PK perspective, it is considered that 
sufficient data are available to support their extrapolation to all indications of Remicade. In addition, the 
patient populations selected (AS and RA) are considered sensitive to evaluate immunogenicity; even in 
combination with MTX, a high level of immune response was demonstrated. 
No interaction studies have been performed as this is not a requirement for a similar biological medicinal 
product. Concomitant use of MTX and other immunomodulators may reduce the formation of antibodies 
against infliximab and increase the plasma concentrations of infliximab. Corticosteroids do not appear to 
affect the PK of infliximab to a clinically relevant extent. The combination of CT-P13 with other biological 
therapeutics used to treat the same conditions as CT-P13, including anakinra and abatacept, is not 
recommended 
Pharmacodynamics 
In the absence of clinically relevant marker of therapeutic activity, several markers of inflammation or 
disease activity (RF, anti-CCP, ESR, and CRP) were measured as PD parameters during the pivotal 
efficacy trial CT-P13 3.1. Great variability was observed in individual changes, but overall, their evolution 
suggested a similar decrease in the disease activity under treatment with CT-P13 or Remicade. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pivotal PK trial (Study CT-P13 1.1) demonstrated that CT-P13 and Remicade exhibit a similar PK 
profile over the first 30 weeks of treatment. In particular, equivalence of systemic exposure to infliximab 
(AUCτ and Cmax,ss) was established at steady state. These results are supported by PK data collected in 
RA patients (Study CT-P13 3.1). Overall, the results are consistent across both clinical studies and 
provide a robust evidence for a similar PK profile between CT-P13 and Remicade. 
Studies CT-P13 1.1 in AS and 3.1 in RA covered the two recommended doses of infliximab (3 and 5 
mg/kg), two different patient populations (age, co-morbidities) and two different types of administration 
(monotherapy and combination with methotrexate). Therefore, from a PK perspective, the data 
adequately support their extrapolation to all other indications of Remicade. Likewise, the immunogenicity 
profile of CT-P13, which has been well characterised in the two clinical studies, appeared comparable to 
that of Remicade and can be extrapolated to all other indications of the reference product.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The pivotal efficacy trial (Study CT-P13 3.1) evaluated the therapeutic equivalence of CT-P13 compared 
to Remicade in patients with active RA. Supportive efficacy data were collected in the pivotal PK trial 
(Study CT-P13 1.1) conducted in AS patients. 
2.5.1.  Dose-response study 
No dose-response studies have been performed. As this application relates to a biosimilar product there 
is no requirement for dose-response studies. The proposed dosing regimens for CT-P13 are identical to 
those approved for Remicade. Depending on the indication, a loading dose regimen of 3 or 5 mg/kg at 0, 
2 and 6 weeks may be followed by a maintenance dose regimen of the same dose every 6 or 8 weeks. 
2.5.2.  Main study 
Study CT-P13 3.1: Randomised, double blind, multicentre, parallel group, Phase 3 study to demonstrate 
equivalence in efficacy and safety of CT-P13 compared with Remicade when co-administrated with 
methotrexate in patients with active RA.

Objectives 
Figure 6  
CT-P13 3.1 study design 
The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate that CT-P13 was equivalent to Remicade up to 
Week 30, in terms of efficacy as determined by clinical response according to the American College of 
Rheumatology (ACR) definition of a 20% improvement (ACR20). 
The secondary objectives of this study were to evaluate long-term efficacy, pharmacokinetics, 
pharmacodynamics, and overall safety of CT-P13 in comparison with Remicade up to Week 54. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving clinical response in accordance to 
the ACR criteria of 20% improvement (ACR20) at Week 30. 
Main secondary efficacy endpoints: 
- 
Individual components of the ACR criteria, comparison with baseline at Weeks 14 and 30; 
-  ACR20 at Week 14; ACR50 and ACR70 at Weeks 14 and 30; 
Inflectra  
Assessment report

-  Mean decrease in disease activity measured by DAS28 (using both ESR and CRP) at Week 14 and 30; 
- 
Proportion of patients with a good response, defined according to the EULAR response criteria, at 
Week 14 and 30; 
-  SDAI and CDAI at Weeks 14 and 30; 
-  SF-36 at Weeks 14 and 30. 
Sample size 
A total of 584 male or female patients were to be enrolled in the study. Therapeutic equivalence to 
Remicade in the all-randomised population was based on expected responder rates of 50% in the test and 
control groups. Specifying a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05, power of 80%, and a 2-sided equivalence margin 
of 15% would require 468 patients to be included in the per-protocol population for the final analysis. 
Assuming that 20% of patients would be excluded from the per-protocol (PP) population would require 
584 patients in total to be randomly assigned to treatment. 
Based on a meta-analysis of historical data with Remicade, in particular the ATTRACT trial, an equivalence 
margin of 15% was shown to ensure superiority over placebo. Although the proposed margin of ±15% 
could be considered clinically relevant, it was accepted by the CHMP in the context of a biosimilarity 
exercise, since it is also based on physicochemical, biological, and PK comparisons. 
Randomisation 
On Day 0, Week 0, patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either CT-P13 or Remicade 
using an interactive voice response system (IVRS) with stratification by geographic region and CRP (> 2.0 
vs. ≤ 2.0 mg/dL). 
Blinding (masking) 
This study was patient, investigator and sponsor-blinded. At Week 30, the study was unblinded for 
reporting purposes and efficacy, PK, PD and safety endpoints were evaluated; the study remained blinded 
to the investigators and patients up to Week 54. 
Statistical methods 
Efficacy analyses sets 
The PP population consisted of all randomised patients who did not have major protocol deviations, i.e. 
who fully complied with the inclusion and exclusion criteria, had received all doses of study treatment up 
to Week 30, did not discontinue or reduce their MTX dose below 12.5 mg/week for more than 
2 consecutive weeks up to Week 30 because of toxicity or non-compliance, and had an ACR assessment 
at Week 30. 
The all-randomised population consisted of all patients enrolled and randomly assigned to receive a dose 
of either of the study treatments, regardless of whether or not any study treatment dosing was completed. 
Eleven patients (7 patients and 4 patients in the CT-P13 and Remicade treatment arms, respectively) 
from a potentially fraudulent study centre, which had been closed due to suspected misconduct, were 
excluded. After unblinding, a sensitivity analysis was performed with inclusion of these patients. 
Definition of ACR response 
A patient was defined as a responder according to ACR20 criteria if the following was fulfilled:  
•  A decrease of at least 20% in the number of tender joints 
•  A decrease of at least 20% in the number of swollen joints and 
Inflectra  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589422/2013 
Page 66/105 
 
  
•  At least a 20% improvement in 3 of the following: patient assessment of pain on VAS; patient global 
assessment of disease status (VAS); physician global assessment of disease status (VAS); health 
assessment questionnaire estimate of physical ability; serum CRP concentration or ESR. 
In addition, patients were considered non-responders if they had discontinued the study, had missing or 
incomplete data for the evaluation of ACR20, had protocol-prohibited medication or changes in 
medication, or required a surgical joint procedure during the study. 
Statistical tests 
Primary analysis 
The proportion of patients achieving ACR20 clinical response at Week 30 was analysed by the exact 
binominal approach, calculating a point estimate and 95% CI for the difference in proportion between the 
2 treatment arms. Therapeutic equivalence was concluded if 95% CI for the treatment difference was 
entirely within -15% to 15%. As this method did not allow for stratification, a sensitivity analysis was 
performed on the primary endpoint, utilizing a logistic regression model, with randomised treatment arm 
as a fixed effect, and region and CRP category as covariates. The primary efficacy analyses were 
performed on both the all-randomised and PP populations. 
Secondary analyses 
The secondary efficacy analyses were only performed in the PP population. Descriptive statistics for actual 
and change from baseline for the individual components of ACR criteria were calculated by treatment and 
study visit. For the comparison of ACR20 at Week 14 and ACR50 and ACR 70 at Weeks 14 and 30 between 
CT-P13 and Remicade, proportions were analysed by exact binominal approach. A sensitivity analysis was 
performed similar to that described above for analysis of the primary endpoint. An analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) was performed at each of the efficacy visits with DAS28 as response, treatment arm as fixed 
effect and baseline DAS28 score, region and CRP category as covariates. A point estimate and 95% CI for 
the treatment difference were provided. The EULAR response criteria were analysed using a proportional 
odds model stratified by region and CRP, calculating an odds ratio with 95% CI for the difference in 
response between the 2 treatment arms. Descriptive statistics were presented for other secondary 
efficacy data. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Of 1,077 patients screened, 606 were randomised to either CT-P13 (N=302) or Remicade (N=304). In 
total 300 (99.3%) patients and 302 (99.3%) patients in the CT-P13 and Remicade treatment arms, 
respectively, initiated study treatment. A similar proportion of patients in each treatment arm 
discontinued the study by Week 30: 49 [16.2%] patients and 46 [15.1%] patients in the CT-P13 and 
Remicade treatment arms, respectively. The most frequently reported reasons for discontinuation from 
the study were adverse events (7.3% and 5.9%, respectively) and withdrawal of consent (3.6% and 
5.3%, respectively). At Week 30, the PP population comprised a total of 499 patients, with 248/302 
(82.1%) randomised to CT-P13 and 251/304 (82.6%) to Remicade.

Fewer patients discontinued the study by Week 54 in the CT-P13 arm (69; 22.8%) than in the Remicade 
arm (82; 27.0%); thus, 233 patients (77.2%) treated with CT-P13 completed the trial versus 222 
patients (73.0%) treated with Remicade. The most frequently reported reasons for discontinuation from 
the study by Week 54 were adverse events (31[10.8%] patients and 41 [13.5%] patients in the CT-P13 
and Remicade treatment arms, respectively) and withdrawal of consent (16 [5.3%] patients and 21 
[6.9%] patients in the CT-P13 and Remicade treatment arms, respectively). Lack of efficacy was reported 
in 10 patients treated with CT-P13 and 6 patients treated with Remicade. 
Recruitment 
The first subject was randomised on 13 December 2010 and the Week 30 Cut-Off Date was on 20 
December 2011. A total of 100 study centres across 19 countries worldwide enrolled patients.  
Conduct of the study 
The study protocol was amended 4 times mostly to clarify details of patient selection criteria. The CHMP 
considered that these amendments have not impacted the outcome of the study. 
The most frequently reported major protocol deviations were patients who did not receive all doses of 
study treatment up to Week 30 (48 [15.9%] patients and 44 [14.5%] patients in the CT-P13 and 
Remicade treatment arms, respectively) and patients who did not have an ACR assessment at Week 30 
(45 [14.9%] patients and 43 [14.1%] patients in the CT-P13 and Remicade treatment arms, 
respectively).

Baseline data 
Demographic characteristics 
Demographic characteristics were similar in the 2 treatment groups. The mean age in the study 
population was 49 years, with a majority of female (83%) and white (73%) patients. More than half the 
patients (54%) had a serum CRP level ≤ 2 mg/dL.

Demographic characteristics (All-randomised population)   
Concomitant medications 
For both the initial dose of MTX (taken at the date of first infusion) and the most recent dose of MTX, the 
mean (SD) dose taken was similar in the treatment arms. For the initial dose of MTX, the mean (SD) dose 
was 15.62 (3.10) mg/week and 15.61 (3.15) mg/week in the CT-P13 and Remicade treatment groups, 
respectively. For the most recent dose of MTX, the mean (SD) dose was 15.43 (2.94) mg/week and 15.52 
(3.21) mg/week in the CT-P13 and Remicade treatment groups, respectively. 
The most frequently reported concomitant medications were anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic 
products (199 [66.1%] patients and 199 [66.1%] patients in the CT-P13 and Remicade treatment 
groups, respectively), corticosteroids for systemic use (207 [68.8%] patients and 180 [59.8%] patients 
in the CT-P13 and Remicade treatment groups, respectively), and antihistamines for systemic use (140 
[46.5%] patients and 142 [47.2%] patients in the CT-P13 and Remicade treatment groups, respectively).

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
In the all-randomised population, the proportion of ACR20 responders at Week 30 was similar in the 
CT-P13 and Remicade treatment arms (184 [60.9%] patients and 178 [58.6%] patients, respectively). 
The 95% CI for the estimate of the treatment difference was entirely contained within the range -0.15 to 
+ 0.15 (95% CI: -0.06, 0.10) indicating therapeutic equivalence between the treatment arms. The 
results for the PP population supported the results for the all-randomised population. The sensitivity 
analysis including patients from the potentially fraudulent study centre indicated a similar trend to the 
main analysis.

The proportion of ACR responders at Week 14 and 30 is shown in the below table. For each of the 
parameters, there was no evidence of a statistically significant difference between the CT-P13 and 
Remicade treatment groups at the 5% level of significance. However, all point estimates showed a higher 
response rate for CT-P13 than Remicade, especially at Week 14 where the 95% CI upper limit was close 
to +0.15 for ACR20 and ACR50.

Disease activity measured by DAS28  
The mean scores for disease activity and number of tender joints and swollen joints measured by DAS28 
decreased from baseline at Weeks 14 and 30 in both treatment arms. The analysis of DAS28 at Weeks 14 
and 30 is summarised for the PP population in the table below. The 95% CIs for the estimate of treatment 
difference contained 0, hence there was no evidence of a difference between the CT-P13 and Remicade 
treatment arms in change from baseline in DAS28 (ESR) or DAS28 (CRP) at either time point at the 5% 
level of significance.

Other endpoints 
The mean decreases from baseline in SDAI and CDAI and the proportions of patients with a good response 
according to EULAR criteria were similar at both time points in the CT-P13 and Remicade treatment arms. 
Likewise, mean increases from baseline at Weeks 14 and 30 were similar in both treatment arms for 
SF-36 components, including fatigue. 
Ancillary analyses 
Analyses for multiplicity were not needed in this trial with only one primary efficacy endpoint. Consistency 
of ACR20 response rates was shown across geographic regions. No post-hoc analyses were performed for 
efficacy.

-  Diagnosis of active AS according to the 1984 modified New York classification criteria [van der 
Linden et al 1984] for at least 3 months prior to Screening; 
-  Active disease as defined by a Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) score 
of ≥4 (range 0 to 10) at Screening in spite of following conventional treatment for AS for at least 
3 months prior to Screening; 
-  Visual analogue scale score for spinal pain of ≥4 (range 0 to 10). 
Main exclusion criteria: 
- 
Tuberculosis (TB), other severe or chronic infections, bone marrow hypoplasia; 
-  Diabetes mellitus, unless on a stable dosing regimen for at least 4 weeks prior to screening; 
-  Any other inflammatory or rheumatic diseases; 
-  History of any malignancy (within the previous 5 years except completely excised and cured 
squamous carcinoma of the uterine cervix, cutaneous basal cell carcinoma, or cutaneous 
squamous cell carcinoma), lymphoma or lymphoproliferative disease; 
-  History of congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association class III/IV) or unstable angina. 
Prohibited concomitant medications 
-  Corticosteroids, except oral glucocorticoids of maximum equivalent daily dose of 10 mg of 
prednisolone within 4 weeks prior to screening; 
-  DMARDs including hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, MTX, or sulfasalazine, within 4 weeks prior 
to screening; 
-  Alkylating agents within 12 months prior to screening; 
- 
Live or live-attenuated vaccine within 8 weeks of screening; 
-  Any biological agents for the treatment of AS. 
Treatment  
Patients received a 2-hour IV infusion of either CT-P13 (5 mg/kg) or Remicade (5 mg/kg) at Weeks 0, 2, 
and 6 and then once every 8 weeks up to Week 54. This corresponds to 3 loading doses and 6 
maintenance doses. 
Objectives  
The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate comparable PK at steady state between CT-P13 
and Remicade in patients with AS up to Week 30. The secondary objectives of this study were to assess 
the long-term efficacy, PK and overall safety of CT-P13 in comparison with Remicade up to Week 54.  
Efficacy endpoints 
The efficacy was assessed at Week 14 and 30 by the following parameters: 
- 
Proportion of patients achieving clinical response according to the ASAS20 and ASAS40 criteria 
Inflectra

Page 77/105 
 
  
-  BASDAI, BASFI, BASMI compared with baseline 
-  Chest expansion compared with baseline 
-  QoL questionnaire (Medical Outcomes Study Short term Health Survey [SF 36]) 
The ASAS20 response is defined as an improvement of at least 20% and an absolute improvement of at 
least 1 unit on a 0 to 10 scale from baseline in at least 3 of the following domains: 
- 
- 
-

Additionally, ASAS20 responders should not have deterioration (worsening of ≥20% and an absolute 
worsening of at least 1 unit on a 0 to 10 scale) of the remaining assessment domain compared to baseline. 
ASAS40 responder are defined as an improvement of at least 40% and an absolute improvement of at 
least 2 units on a 0 to 10 scale from baseline in at least 3 of the 4 domains of the ASAS20, with no 
deterioration from baseline in the remaining domain. For the analyses of ASAS20 and ASAS40 at Weeks 
14 and 30, patients who had an assessment and had recorded missing values at that visit for any of the 
4 components of ASAS20/ASAS40 were classified as non-responders. 
Sample size 
A total of 246 male or female patients were to be enrolled in the study. Assuming a CV of 50%, an 
expected ratio of means equal to 1, a 2-sided alpha equal to 0.1, a power equal to 90%, and a 2-sided 
equivalence margin of 80% to 125% for AUCτ and Cmax,ss, a recruitment of 196 patients was required. 
Allowing for a dropout rate of 20% would mean that 246 patients would need to be randomly assigned to 
treatment in total. In total 250 patients were enrolled in the study (all-randomised population). 
Randomisation  
Randomisation of patients was conducted using an interactive voice response system (IVRS). It was 
stratified by region and baseline BASDAI score. 
Blinding (masking) 
This study was patient, investigator and sponsor-blinded. At Week 30, the study was unblinded for 
reporting purposes; the study remained blinded to the investigators and patients up to Week 54. 
Statistical methods (efficacy analysis)  
The efficacy parameters were assessed on the all-randomised population, which consisted of all patients 
enrolled and randomly assigned to receive a dose of either of the study treatments, regardless of whether 
or not any study treatment dosing was completed. 
For ASAS20 and ASAS40, the proportion of overall responders was analysed by a logistic regression 
model, with randomised treatment arm as a fixed effect and the stratification factors (region, baseline 
BASDAI score) as covariates. Treatment effects were estimated by calculating the odds ratio and 95% CI. 
For the other parameters, descriptive statistics for actual values and change from baseline were 
calculated by treatment and study visit.

Participant flow and baseline characteristics  
These are described in section 2.3.2 up to Week 30. 
The week 54 results update showed that 210 patients completed the study (106/125 [84.8%] in the 
CT-P13 group and 104/125 [83.2%] in the Remicade group). By Week 54, 40/250 (16%) patients had 
discontinued, 19/125 (15.2%) in the CT-P13 group and 21/125 (16.8%) in the Remicade group. The 
primary reasons for discontinuation were adverse events (10/125 [8.0%] and 8/125 [6.4%] patients in 
the CT-P13 and Remicade group, respectively), and withdrawal of consent by the patient (3/125 [2.4%] 
and 6/125 [4.8%] patients in the CT-P13 and Remicade group, respectively). 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar in the 2 treatment groups. In total, there were a 
greater percentage of male patients compared with female patients, i.e. 99/125 (79.2%) in the CT-P13 
group and 103/125 (82.4) in the Remicade group. Mean age was 39.2 years in the CT-P13 group and 38.7 
years in the Remicade group. The majority of patients were White (75.6%) and from European region 
(64.8%). The majority of patients (187 [74.8%]) had a baseline BASDAI score of <8 (92 [73.6%] 
patients and 95 [76.0%] patients in the CT-P13 and Remicade treatment groups, respectively). The 
BASDAI score at baseline was ≥8 in 33/125 (26.4%) and in 30/125 (24.0%) in the CT-P13 and Remicade 
group, respectively.  
Outcomes and estimation 
ASAS20 and ASAS40 responses  
The proportion of patients achieving clinical response according to the ASAS20 and ASAS40 criteria at 
Weeks 14 and 30 was similar in the CT-P13 and Remicade treatment arms. The 95% CI contained 1 for 
both criteria at each of the time points and hence there was no evidence of a difference between CT-P13 
and Remicade at either visit at the 5% level of significance.

2.5.4.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Main study 
Study CT-P13 3.1 is a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group study designed to demonstrate 
equivalence in efficacy and safety between CT-P13 and Remicade when co-administered with MTX in 
patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. Randomisation was stratified by geographic region and baseline 
CRP level (> 2.0 vs. ≤ 2.0 mg/dL). 
A single pivotal equivalence trial comparing the test and reference products is considered adequate to 
support this biosimilar application. The trial was designed to show equivalence of the test and reference 
products if the 95% CI for the difference between treatments was entirely within -15% to +15% in both 
the all-randomised and PP populations. The choice of the indication (RA), the clinical setting (patients not 
adequately controlled with MTX), the primary endpoint (ACR20 at Week 30) and the equivalence margin 
(± 15%) are in line with the CHMP guidance and were endorsed in CHMP scientific advice. Indeed, this 
clinical model was considered sufficiently sensitive to enable the detection of differences between the two 
Inflectra  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589422/2013 
Page 80/105 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
products. The choice of the patient population was based on the effect size (infliximab vs. placebo) 
observed in the pivotal Remicade trials, which appeared larger in the ATTRACT trial (patients with 
inadequate response to MTX) than in the ASPIRE trial (with MTX in the first line). 
The main secondary efficacy endpoints were the individual components of the ACR criteria, ACR20 at 
Week 14 as well as ACR50 and ACR70 at Weeks 14 and 30, decrease in disease activity measured by 
DAS28 (using both ESR and CRP), EULAR response, SDAI, CDAI, and SF-36 at Weeks 14 and 30. 
The study was unblinded at Week 30 for reporting. However, the study was kept blinded to the 
investigators and patients until its end. The Applicant included the results of the primary analysis in the 
initial submission and provided the follow-up data up to 1 year (data collected up to Week 62) upon CHMP 
request. 
CT-P13 and Remicade were administered as a dose of 3 mg/kg in a 2-hour IV infusion according to the 
approved posology of Remicade. Methotrexate (12.5 - 25 mg/week) was co-administered either via oral 
or parenteral route. The dose and the route were maintained from beginning to end of study. Folic acid 
(≥5 mg/week) was included in the co-medication in order to reduce the adverse effects of MTX.  
Supporting study  
The PK study CT-P13 1.1 was a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group comparison of CT-P13 and 
Remicade in patients with active AS with a BASDAI score ≥4 in spite of conventional treatment. 
Randomisation was stratified by region and baseline BASDAI score. The study was designed primarily to 
demonstrate the PK equivalence between CT-P13 and Remicade and efficacy was studied as part of the 
secondary objectives. The main efficacy criteria were the proportion of patients achieving clinical 
response according to the ASAS20 and ASAS40 criteria at Weeks 14 and 30, as well as BASDAI, BASFI, 
BASMI, and SF-36 scores at Weeks 14 and 30 compared with baseline. 
Both trials, CT-P13 1.1 and CT-P13 3.1, were conducted mainly in Eastern Europe and Latin America, with 
additional enrolment in Korea or Philippines, but few patients from Western-Europe. As similar results 
were shown across geographic regions, the CHMP considered it is acceptable. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study CT-P13 3.1  
Patient demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced across the treatment arms, 
although there were slightly more women and white people with slightly higher disease activity in the 
CT-P13 arm. Overall, more than half the patients had a baseline CRP concentration ≤ 2 mg/dL. The 
results are robust as only 15-16% of patients discontinued before Week 30, mostly because of an adverse 
event or withdrawal of consent; no notable imbalance was observed between the treatment arms with 
regard to the reasons for discontinuation except for lack of efficacy (6 patients in the CT-P13 arm vs. none 
in the Remicade arm). However, in the updated analysis at Week 54, these figures became 10 vs. 6 
patients, respectively. 
The populations for the efficacy analysis included all randomised patients and the PP population, the main 
protocol violation being the omission of a scheduled infliximab infusion and the lack of ACR assessment. 
The concomitant treatments for RA were comparable, except for the use of systemic corticosteroids that 
was slightly more common in the CT-P13 arm (69%) than in the Remicade arm (60%); the mean dose of 
corticosteroid remained stable throughout the study in both treatment arms.  
At Week 30, a similar proportion of patients in the CT-P13 (184/302, 60.9%) and the Remicade arm 
(178/304, 58.6%) achieved a clinical response according to ACR20 criteria in the all-randomised 
Inflectra  
Assessment report

Page 81/105 
 
  
 
 
population. The 95% CI for the estimated treatment difference (CT-P13 – Remicade = +2% [-6%, 
+10%]) was entirely contained within the range ±15% indicating therapeutic equivalence between the 
treatment groups. Similar results were reported in the PP population analysis. A sensitivity analysis using 
a logistic regression model produced almost identical CIs in both the all-randomised and PP populations; 
so the conclusion is robust to the method of analysis. The CIs did not change if the patients from the 
potentially fraudulent centre (11 in total) were included in the analysis. Consistency of ACR20 response 
rates was shown across geographic regions with expected random fluctuation of the difference between 
the test and reference products. It was noted that the response rate was higher in this trial (60-70%) 
compared with the ATTRACT trial, the pivotal trial for Remicade, and the Applicant’s assumption (50%). 
It was also noted that baseline CRP levels were lower than in the ATTRACT trial, leading to the possibility 
that a population with less severe disease had been enrolled. The Applicant further justified the assay 
sensitivity of the trial based on a discussion of all published studies available with Remicade; moreover, 
the data from study CT-P13 3.1 did not suggest a correlation between baseline CRP level and response 
rate.  
Overall, based on these data, equivalence of the ACR20 response at Week 30 was demonstrated in both 
all-randomised and PP populations. The point estimates were numerically in favour of CT-P13 and 
non-inferiority was clearly demonstrated as the CI lower bounds were well above -10%, which is a 
preferred margin from a clinical perspective. Therefore, this result provides clear assurance that CT-P13 
is not inferior to Remicade. At week 30, the results of the secondary endpoints (in particular ACR50 and 
ACR70, decreases in DAS28, SDAI and CDAI, increases in SF-36) were all consistent with the results of 
the primary endpoint with estimates of treatment effect numerically in favour of CT-P13. At the earlier 
time point of Week 14, which may be more sensitive to detect potential differences before the response 
rate reaches its plateau, the point estimates for ACR20 response were also numerically greater with 
CT-P13 than with Remicade in both the PP and all-randomised populations; although the treatment 
difference reached +7% (PP analysis), the 95% upper limit of the CI was 15%, the predefined acceptance 
margin to demonstrate equivalence. The decrease in disease activity measured by DAS28 appeared in 
line with the ACR response results with estimates of treatment differences in favour of CT-P13, especially 
at Week 14. All 95% CIs were well contained within the interval of ± 0.6, which corresponds to the 
maximum change in DAS score considered as “no response” according to EULAR criteria. Likewise, 
estimates of the other secondary endpoints generally showed numerical trends in favour of CT-P13, 
especially at Week 14. 
During the procedure the Applicant provided Week 54 efficacy results in the PP population. The proportion 
of patients achieving clinical response according to the ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 criteria at Week 54 
remained numerically in favour of CT-P13 compared with Remicade, with 95% CIs for the treatment 
differences contained within ±15%. Comparable results were also observed for the secondary endpoints. 
Therefore, these results further support a comparable efficacy of CT-P13 and Remicade. 
Study CT-P13 1.1 
Overall, treatment arms were comparable for demographic characteristics and baseline disease activity 
index. The proportion of patients achieving clinical response according to the ASAS20 and ASAS40 criteria 
at Weeks 14 and 30 was similar in the CT-P13 and Remicade treatment arms in the all-randomised 
population. No evidence of difference was observed between CT-P13 and Remicade at the 5% level of 
significance. Mean BASDAI, BASFI and BASMI score decreased similarly from baseline to Weeks 14 and 
30 in both treatment arms. During the procedure the Applicant provided Week 54 efficacy results, which 
showed comparable ASAS20 responder rates. In contrast to the pivotal RA trial, no trend was observed in 
favour of either product in this AS population. 
Inflectra  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589422/2013 
Page 82/105 
 
  
Overall, although this supportive efficacy study in AS patients was not powered to show therapeutic 
equivalence, the results were comparable between treatment arms, as reflected by ASAS20 and ASAS40 
responses and decreases in BASDAI and BASFI. 
2.5.5.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The pivotal efficacy study CT-P13 3.1 conducted in RA patients provided robust evidence of therapeutic 
equivalence based on ACR20 response at Week 30, the primary endpoint, as well as all secondary efficacy 
parameters. While the results were numerically in favour of CT-P13, the 95% CIs of the treatment 
differences remained confined within the predefined therapeutic equivalence margin of ±15%. These 
data were further supported by comparable response rates at 1 year. 
Additional supportive efficacy data were provided in another indication by the PK study CT-P13 1.1 
conducted in AS patients. The efficacy results were comparable between treatment arms up to Week 54, 
with no trend favouring either product. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety data of CT-P13 were collected in the 3 clinical trials: the pilot trial CT-P13 1.2 in RA patients, 
the pivotal PK trial in AS patients CT-P13 1.1, and the pivotal efficacy trial CT-P13 3.1 in RA patients. The 
safety analysis was performed on the safety population defined as all patients who received at least one 
full or partial dose of either of the study treatments during any dosing period. The safety monitoring 
included monitoring of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse event (SAE), treatment-emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs), serious TEAEs, death, hypersensitivity via vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), physical 
examination, clinical laboratory tests, concomitant medications, signs and symptoms of tuberculosis (TB), 
and pregnancy. Infections, infusion-related reactions and safety issues of special interest for infliximab 
were closely monitored. The areas of special interest were heart failure, serious infections (including TB, 
Hepatitis B virus reactivation, sepsis and opportunistic infections) as well as serious infusion reactions, 
delayed hypersensitivity reactions (serum sickness), systemic lupus erythematosus/lupus-like syndrome, 
hepatobiliary events, demyelinating disorders (i.e. multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barré syndrome), 
haematologic reactions, lymphoma (including hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma). 
Patient exposure 
In total, 871 patients were included in the safety population of all 3 studies: 
•  Study CT-P13 3.1: 602 RA patients (301 patients in each treatment group) 
•  Study CT-P13 1.1: 250 AS patients (128 patients treated with CT-P13 and 122 with Remicade) 
•  Study CT-P13 1.2: 19 RA patients (10 patients treated with CT-P13 and 9 with Remicade) 
In the initial submission, the data cut-off corresponded to a minimum exposure of 30 weeks for all 
ongoing patients. There were 263 patients with RA and 117 patients with AS exposed to CT-P13 for at 
least 30 weeks of treatment. 
In Study CT-P13 3.1, the total number of doses received by Week 30 was similar in the CT-P13 and 
Remicade arms (mean of 5.6 doses). The mean total dose administered was 1191.6±357.361 mg in the 
CT-P13 arm and 1178.3±347.778 mg in the Remicade arm, respectively.

The proportion of patients reporting drug-related TEAEs according to the investigator’s judgment was 
similar in the 2 treatment arms: 106 (35.2%) patients and 108 (35.9%) patients in the CT-P13 and 
Remicade treatment arms, respectively. The most frequently reported drug-related TEAEs (in ≥2% 
patients) were latent TB (CT-P13 arm: 4.3% vs. Remicade arm 4.7%), increased ALT (3.0% vs. 3.3%), 
increased AST (1.7% vs. 2.3%), RA (2.3% vs. 1.3%), nasopharyngitis (2.0% vs. 1.3%), urinary tract 
infection (1.3% vs. 2.3%), drug hypersensitivity (1.7% vs. 2.7%), infusion-related reaction (1.0% vs. 
2.0%) and headache (1.3% vs. 2.0%). 
The majority of TEAEs were of mild and moderate severity. Severe TEAEs were reported in a total of 25 
(8.3%) patients in the CT-P13 arm and 21 (7.0%) patients in the Remicade arm. Only 3 TEAEs of severe 
intensity were reported in more than 1 patient in any treatment arm: asthenia, bone pain and RA. 
-  Study CT-P13 1.1 
In the initial safety analysis, the number of patients reporting TEAEs was 83 (65%) in the CT-P13 arm and 
78 (64%) in the Remicade arm. The most frequently TEAEs reported (in ≥5% patients in any treatment 
arm) included increased ALT (14.8% patients vs. 14.8% patients), increased AST (12.5% vs. 9.8%), 
increased blood creatine phosphokinase (CPK) (5.5% vs. 1.6%), headache (7.8% vs. 4.1%), 
nasopharyngitis (7.0% vs. 5.7%) and upper respiratory tract infection (3.1% vs. 7.4%). All TEAEs 
reported in ≥1% of patients in any treatment arm are summarised in the table below.

The proportion of patients reporting drug-related TEAEs was similar in the 2 treatment arms: 57/128 
(44.5%) and 58/122 (47.5%) in the CT-P13 and Remicade arm, respectively. The most frequently 
reported drug-related TEAEs (in ≥2% patients) were increased ALT (CT-P13 arm: 9.4% vs. Remicade arm: 
9.0%), increased AST (8.6% vs. 6.6%), increased gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) (2.3% vs. 2.5%), 
blood CPK increased (3.1% vs. 0.8%), latent TB (3.9% vs. 3.3%), urinary tract infection (3.9% vs. 0%), 
nasopharyngitis (2.3% vs. 1.6%), pharyngitis (1.6% vs. 2.5%), upper respiratory tract infection (2.3% 
vs. 1.6%), pyrexia (2.3% vs. 1.6%), headache (2.3% vs. 0.8%), infusion-related reaction (0% vs. 2.5%) 
and rash (0% vs. 2.5%). 
Most TEAEs were of mild to moderate severity. In the CT-P13 arm, 3 (2.3%) patients experienced 5 
severe TEAEs compared to 6 (4.9%) patients in the Remicade arm experiencing 7 severe TEAEs. No 
severe TEAE was reported by more than 1 patient in either treatment arm except for increased GGT in 2 
patients. 
-  Study CT-P13 1.2 
The proportion of patients who experienced TEAEs was similar in the 2 treatment arms; 6 patients in the 
CT-P13 arm and 5 patients in the Remicade arm reported 16 and 18 TEAEs, respectively. Only 
hypersensitivity, dizziness and pruritus were observed in more than 1 patient (all in the Remicade arm). 
Serious adverse events/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
No deaths were reported in any study up to week 30. In the updated safety analysis up to Week 54, 
three deaths were reported: 1 in the CT-P13 arm (after a traffic accident) and 2 in the Remicade arm (1 
after a traffic accident and 1 sudden death). 
Serious adverse events 
-  Study CT-P13 3.1 
In the initial analysis, 30/301 (10%) patients in the CT-P13 arm and 21/301 (7%) patients in the 
Remicade arm experienced 35 SAEs and 22 SAEs, respectively. The most frequently reported SAEs were 
uveitis (CT-P13: 2 patients, 0.7% vs. Remicade: 0%), infusion-related reaction (1 patient, 0.3% vs. 4, 
1.3%), disseminated TB (2 patients, 0.7% vs. 0%), and deep vein thrombosis (2 patients, 0.7% vs. 0%). 
No other SAEs were reported for more than 1 patient in either treatment arm. SAEs were considered 
drug-related in 17 (5.6%) patients in the CT-P13 arm and in 10 (3.3%) patients in the Remicade arm.

In the safety update up to Week 54, 42 (14%) patients in the CT-P13 arm and 30 (10%) patients in the 
Remicade arm experienced 49 SAEs and 38 SAEs, respectively. 
-  Study CT-P13 1.1 
In the initial analysis, 9 patients experienced SAEs: 4/128 (3.1%) patients in the CT-P13 arm 
experiencing 5 SAEs and 5/122 (4.1%) patients in the Remicade arm experiencing 8 SAEs. Drug-related 
SAEs occurred in 3 (2.3%) patients receiving CT-P13 (TB and oesophageal perforation, disseminated TB, 
and dyspnoea in the third patient) and in 4 (3.3%) patients receiving Remicade(cellulitis and wound 
infection, infusion-related reaction, pulmonary TB, and infusion-related reaction). 
In the safety update at Week 54; similar numbers of patients with SAEs were observed: 8 patients in each 
arm experienced 10 SAEs for the CT-P13 arm and 11 SAEs for the Remicade arm. 
-  Study CT-P13 1.2 
One patient in the CT-P13 arm experienced 7 SAEs and 1 patient in the Remicade arm experienced 2 
SAEs. Five of the 7 SAEs reported in the CT-P13 group were drug related: disseminated TB, sepsis, septic 
shock, hepatotoxicity, and pneumonia. The 2 remaining SAEs were not drug-related (pancreatitis and 
acute renal failure). All SAEs led to premature discontinuation from treatment. The 2 SAEs reported with 
Remicade were considered not drug related (hypotension and peptic ulcer). 
Other significant events 
-  Risk of infections 
In the initial analysis of Study CT-P13 3.1, the proportions of patients who experienced at least 1 TEAE of 
infection were similar in the CT-P13 and Remicade treatment arms (95 patients, 31.6% vs. 107 patients, 
35.5%, respectively). The number of TEAEs was also similar:  141 and 149, respectively. The most 
frequent infections in the CT-P13 arm were latent TB (6.3%), nasopharyngitis (6.3%), urinary tract 
infection (4.3%), and upper respiratory tract infection (4.0%). In the Remicade arm, they were latent TB 
(6.0%), nasopharyngitis (5.0%), bronchitis (4.0%), and urinary tract infection (4.0%). No other 
infections were reported for more than 3% of patients in either treatment arm. The majority of these 
infections were considered to be unrelated to study treatment. 
The safety update up to Week 54 also showed that the proportion of patients who experienced at least 1 
TEAE of infection was similar between the treatment arms: 126 patients (41.7%) in the CT-P13 arm vs. 
136 patients (45.3%) in the Remicade arm. The most frequent infections (≥ 5% patients) reported in the 
CT-P13 treatment arm were latent TB (8.9%), upper respiratory tract infection (8.9%), nasopharyngitis 
(7.9%), and urinary tract infection (6.0%). In the Remicade arm, they were latent TB (8.3%), urinary 
tract infection (7.0%), nasopharyngitis (5.7%), bronchitis (5.7%), and upper respiratory tract infection 
(5.3%). 
In the initial analysis of Study CT-P13 1.1, TEAEs of infection were reported by 41 (32.0%) patients and 
41 (33.6%) patients in the CT-P13 and Remicade treatment arms, respectively. The most frequent 
infections in the CT-P13 arm were nasopharyngitis (7.0%), urinary tract infection (4.7%), latent TB 
(3.9%), upper respiratory tract infection (3.1%), pharyngitis and sinusitis (2.3% each). In the Remicade 
arm, they were upper respiratory tract infection (7.4%), nasopharyngitis (5.7%), influenza (4.1%), 
latent TB (3.3%), and pharyngitis (3.3%). 
At Week 54, the proportion of patients who experienced at least 1 TEAE of infection were similar between 
the treatment arms: 53 patients (41.4%) in the CT-P13 arm vs. 49 patients (40.2%) in the Remicade 
arm. The most frequent infections (more than 5% patients) in the CTP13 arm were nasopharyngitis 
Inflectra  
Assessment report

Page 89/105 
 
  
 
(9.4%), upper respiratory tract infection (7.8%), as well as latent TB and urinary tract infection (6.3% 
each). In the Remicade arm, they were upper respiratory tract infection (10.7%), nasopharyngitis 
(8.2%), and pharyngitis (5.7%). 
In Study CT-P13 1.2, the proportion of patients who experienced at least 1 TEAE of infection was similar 
in the CT-P13 and Remicade treatment arms (4 patients, 44.4% vs. 3 patients, 33.3%, respectively). 
Overall, in the safety update at Week 54, 18 serious infections were reported across all studies in 16 
patients treated with CT-P13 vs. 12 in 10 in patients treated with Remicade; these included in particular 
active tuberculosis (6 vs. 1) and pneumonia (5 vs. 0). In total, 7 cases of active TB (including 3 
disseminated TB) occurred in patients treated with CT-P13 (1.6%) vs. 1 case (0.2%) in patients treated 
with Remicade. However, it is noted that in the CT-P13 arm, four cases of TB did not fulfil adequate 
diagnostic criteria of tuberculosis and/or had pre-existing suspicious pulmonary lesions.

Infusion-related reactions 
In the initial analysis of Study CT-P13 3.1, 16 (5.3%) patients in the CT-P13 arm and 18 (6.0%) patients 
in the Remicade arm experienced at least 1 TEAE due to the infusion of study medication. The total 
number of TEAEs reported was 20 in the CT-P13 arm (10 mild/7 moderate/3 severe) and 30 in the 
Remicade arm (15 mild/13 moderate/2 severe). TEAEs were serious in 4 /301 patients (1.3%) in each 
treatment arm and 9 (3.0%) patients in each treatment arm discontinued study treatment due to an 
infusion-related reaction. 
In the initial analysis of Study CT-P13 1.1, 5/128 (3.9%) patients in the CT-P13 arm and 6/122 (4.9%) 
patients in the Remicade arm experienced an infusion-related reaction, respectively. 
No infusion-related reaction occurred in Study CT-P13 1.2. 
In the safety update at Week 54, infusion-related reactions were reviewed based on a more 
comprehensive definition; this analysis showed fewer infusion-related reactions to CT-P13 than Remicade. 
In Study CT-P13 1.1, 4 (3%) patients in the CT-P13 arm and 11 (9%) patients in the Remicade arm 
experienced hypersensitivity and infusion-related reactions. In Study CT-P13 3.1, 23 (8%) patients in the 
CT-P13 arm and 31 (10%) patients in the Remicade arm experienced hypersensitivity and 
infusion-related reactions. Serious infusion-related reactions including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid 
Inflectra  
Assessment report

reactions occurred in the same number of patients (7) in both treatment arms and led to treatment 
discontinuation. Furthermore, the same proportion of the affected patients (5 patients; 71%) was 
antibody-positive with higher NAb titres compared to the average of the safety population. The type, 
management and outcome of these reactions were also comparable between the treatment arms. 
-  Other adverse events of special interest 
No heart failure, systemic lupus erythematosus/lupus-like syndrome, demyelinating disorders as well as 
lymphoproliferative disorders were reported in the 3 studies. 
SAEs of hepatotoxicity were reported in 2 patients treated with CT-P13. Neutropenia occurred in 3 
patients receiving CT-P13 and 2 patients receiving Remicade. 
Cases of malignancies were observed in 1 patient treated with CT-P13 (renal neoplasm) and 3 patients 
treated with Remicade (breast, ovarian, skin). 
Laboratory findings 
In Study CT-P13 3.1, there were 38 CTCAE grade 3/4 laboratory results in the CT-P13 arm and 27 in the 
Remicade arm. The most common significant grade 3 (severe) abnormality was high GGT concentration 
(6 [2.0%] patients in each treatment arm). The most common grade 4 (life threatening) result was low 
total neutrophils level (4 [1.3%] patients and 3 [1.0%] patients in the CT-P13 and Remicade treatment 
arms, respectively). 
In Study CT-P13 1.1, there were 26 CTCAE grade 3/4 laboratory results in the CT-P13 arm and 20 in the 
Remicade arm. Ten patients (6 and 4 patients in the CT-P13 and Remicade arms, respectively) had grade 
4 results. 
Immunological events 
See immunogenicity in the PK section. The impact of antibody development on the efficacy and safety of 
CT-P13 and Remicade was further investigated during the procedure upon request of the CHMP. 
In the RA study CT-P13 3.1, complete loss of efficacy (defined as loss of ACR20 response) was reported 
slightly more frequently with CT-P13 than Remicade: at Week 30, 14% vs. 10%, respectively, and at 
Week 54, 13% vs. 11%, respectively (PP population). In addition, slightly more patients discontinued 
CT-P13 treatment than Remicade (10 vs. 6) due to lack of efficacy. An opposite trend was reported in the 
AS study CT-P13 1.1: at Week 30, 5% vs. 9%, respectively, and at Week 54, 9% vs. 10%, respectively 
(All-randomised population). 
The efficacy response (ASAS20, ACR20) and adverse reactions (hypersensitivity and infusion related 
reactions) were analysed by seroconversion status at Week 54. In study CT-P13 3.1, the response rates 
were higher in ADA-negative patients as expected but comparable between the two products in each 
seroconversion status subgroup. The ACR20 response rate in the seroconverted subgroup was 49.1% in 
the CT-P13 arm and 44.5% in the Remicade arm compared with 66.7% and 61.2%, respectively, in the 
non-seroconverted subgroup. In Study CT-P13 1.1, comparable ASAS20 response rates were observed in 
the non-seroconverted subgroup (74.0% vs. 71.1% in the CT-P13 and Remicade arms, respectively). In 
the seroconverted subgroup, a difference in the response rate was noted (48.3% in the CT-P13 arm vs. 
65.6 % in the Remicade arm) but the number of patients in this subgroup was small. 
The analysis of the safety data showed that the development of antibodies to infliximab was associated 
with an increase in the frequency of hypersensitivity/ infusion-related reactions in both treatment arms as 
indicated in the table below.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the initial analysis of Study CT-P13 3.1, TEAEs leading to premature discontinuation from study 
treatment were reported in 29 (9.6%) patients in the CT-P13 arm compared to 26 (8.6%) patients in the 
Remicade arm, respectively. In the CT-P13 arm, the most frequently reported TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation were infusion-related reaction (3 patients, 1.0%), disseminated tuberculosis (2 patients, 
0.7%), latent tuberculosis (2 patients, 0.7%), and ALT increased (2 patients, 0.7%). In the Remicade 
arm, these TEAEs were infusion-related reaction (5 patients, 1.7%), drug hypersensitivity (3 patients, 
1.0%), and latent tuberculosis (4 patients, 1.3%). 
In the initial analysis of study CT-P13 1.1, TEAEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 6 (4.7%) 
patients in the CT-P13 arm compared to 5 (4.1%) patients in the Remicade arm. In the CT-P13 arm, these 
TEAEs were: TB (active 2 and latent 1); increased ALT (1); paraesthesia (2), dyspnoea (1). These TEAEs 
were infusion-related reaction (3), pulmonary TB (1), myocardial infarction (1) in the Remicade arm.  
In study CT-P13 1.2, TEAEs leading discontinuation from study treatment were reported in 2 patients in 
the CT-P13 arm and 1 patient in the Remicade arm. 
In the safety update at Week 54 of the RA study CT-P13 3.1, TEAEs leading to premature discontinuation 
of study treatment were reported in 33 (10.9%) patients in the CT-P13 arm compared to 45 (15.0%) 
patients in the Remicade arm. In Study CT-P13 1.1, TEAEs leading to premature discontinuation of study 
treatment were reported in 10 (7.8%) patients in the CT-P13 arm compared to 9 (7.4%) patients in the 
Remicade arm. The TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation were generally similar in both treatment 
arms, mainly infusion-related reactions and tuberculosis (latent or active).

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In total, 871 patients were included in the safety population: 602 from Study CT-P13 3.1, 250 from Study 
CT-P13 1.1 and 19 from Study CT-P13 1.2. A safety update at 54 weeks after all patients had completed 
the comparative treatment phase of the trials was submitted as requested by the CHMP. Overall, 455 
(75%) patients in the RA trial and 210 (84%) patients in the AS trial received the full treatment (9 
infusions); this represents a safety database of 339 patients treated with CT-P13 for 1 year.

A long-term follow-up study in patients with refractory RA recently published (Delabaye & De Keyser 
2010) found that the highest number of adverse reactions, including infections and infusion reactions, 
were reported during the first 26 weeks of treatment with infliximab; thereafter, their incidence 
decreased gradually over time. Thus, the main comparison of the safety profile of the two products in the 
initial safety analysis covering essentially the first 30 weeks of treatment is justified. In the two pivotal 
trials, the proportion of patients reporting TEAEs was similar in the 2 treatment arms: 60% in the CT-P13 
arm vs. 61% in the Remicade arm in the RA trial and 65% vs. 64%, respectively, in the AS trial. The 
majority of TEAEs were of mild to moderate severity. 
Overall, the type and incidence of TEAEs to CT-P13 and Remicade reported in the RA and AS trials 
appeared generally similar and in line with those expected on the basis of the Remicade SmPC; they 
reflect the pharmacodynamics and immunogenic properties of infliximab. The most common ADRs were 
infections, including tuberculosis (latent or active) and nasopharyngitis, increase in liver enzymes, 
infusion-related reactions, hypertension and headache. 
Upon request of the CHMP, the Applicant further evaluated the vascular events, which overall occurred 
slightly more frequently with CT-P13 (29 patients; 6.7%) than with Remicade (17 patients; 4.0%), and 
especially hypertension (19 [4.4%] patients treated with CT-P13 vs. 11 [2.6%] patients treated with 
Remicade). The Applicant showed that more patients in the CT-P13 arm had a medical history of 
hypertension and/or other underlying conditions predisposing to hypertension compared to the Remicade 
arm. About 50% of the cases in the CT-P13 arm occurred in patients with known ongoing hypertension, 
and importantly, the number of patients with new-onset of hypertension was similar in both treatment 
arms (10 vs. 9). Most events of hypertension, which is known to be highly prevalent in RA, were mild to 
moderate in severity; they occurred mainly during the initial phase of therapy (i.e. up to Week 22). Other 
vascular events included thrombophlebitis (superficial or deep) in 4 patients in the CT-P13 arm vs. 3 in 
the Remicade arm and venous insufficiency in 3 patients vs. 1, respectively. Overall, the CHMP concluded 
that the detailed analyses presented did not indicate any unexpected safety signal of vascular event, in 
particular hypertension, with CT-P13. 
It is well known that antibodies to infliximab may induce a decrease in therapeutic response and loss of 
efficacy. Data from the two clinical trials are consistent with this finding; for example, the overall ACR20 
response rate at Week 54 was 47% in patients that had seroconverted compared with 64% in patients 
that remained antibody-negative. However, importantly, the impact of the immune response was 
comparable in the CT-P13 and Remicade arms, with a difference of about 17 points between the response 
rates of seropositive and seronegative patients. A higher risk of infusion reactions was also found in the 
patients that seroconverted during the studies (13.8%) than in those that remained antibody-negative 
(2.7%), with more infusion-related reactions reported with Remicade than CT-P13. Likewise, the 
influence of antibodies was similar in both treatment arms, with a 4.5- to 6-fold increase in reaction rates 
in the presence of antibodies. Overall, these analyses demonstrate that the impact of antibodies against 
infliximab on the efficacy and safety of CT-P13 or Remicade is comparable. 
The main safety concern raised during the procedure related to a slightly higher incidence of SAEs under 
CT-P13 than under Remicade in the RA trial: in the safety update at Week 54, 42 (14%) patients in the 
CT-P13 arm and 30 (10%) patients in the Remicade arm experienced 49 SAEs and 38 SAEs, respectively. 
The numerical imbalance was mainly due to an excess of infections and vascular disorders. In the AS trial, 
the incidence of SAEs was the same in both treatment arms. 
In the whole database across trials, the overall numerical imbalance in patients with serious infectious 
events (16 vs. 10) was essentially driven by an imbalance in cases of active tuberculosis (6 vs. 1; in total, 
7 cases vs. 1) and pneumonia (5 vs. 0). For the latter, the Applicant referred to an imbalance of risk 
factors for pneumonia in the medical history (chronic bronchitis or emphysema, and uncontrolled 
Inflectra  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589422/2013 
Page 93/105 
 
  
diabetes mellitus) between the treatment arms. The Applicant further discussed in details the potential 
safety signal of tuberculosis and impaired host defence with a range of arguments as follows. 
• 
• 
• 
In the CT-P13 arm, four cases of TB did not fulfil adequate diagnostic criteria of tuberculosis and/or 
had pre-existing suspicious pulmonary lesions. 
The total rate of infections was comparable in both treatment arms: 42% in patients receiving 
CT-P13 vs. 44% in patients receiving Remicade. No other opportunistic infections were identified and 
observed malignancies were equally distributed across the treatment arms. 
The TB rate in patients treated with CT-P13 (1.6%) was comparable to those reported in historical RA 
studies (0.6%, range of 0% - 1.2%) and AS studies (0.8%, range of 0% - 5%) with Remicade 
whereas it was unexpectedly low in patients treated with Remicade (0.2%). 
•  Seroconversion in the interferon-gamma release assay was equally frequent in both treatment arms: 
23% in each arm of the AS trial and 20% (CT-P13) vs. 19% (Remicade) in the RA trial. 
• 
There is no plausible explanation for a difference in host defence from a mechanistic point of view 
considering the difference in glycosylation detected in the Fc region of the two products. Lower ADCC 
would result in reduced cytolysis of T cells, monocytes and macrophages, conferring less inhibition of 
host defence. Moreover, the risk of TB seems mainly mediated by the Fab region as certolizumab, an 
anti-TNF devoid of Fc region, appears to display a similar risk of TB as the intact anti-TNF antibodies. 
Based on the totality of the evidence presented, the CHMP concluded that the difference observed in the 
clinical programme was likely to be a chance finding. 
As described in the RMP, the Applicant will further follow-up the risk of serious infections including TB as 
part of several registries in South Korea and the EU enrolling patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 
inflammatory bowel diseases. The Applicant will provide annual reports on these registries until 2026. 
Long term safety, including risk of infection and TB, is further monitored in an ongoing Korean 
post-marketing surveillance study in all adult infliximab indications. Additional safety data will also be 
provided from planned and ongoing comparative studies and extension studies open to patients recruited 
in the initial studies. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The size of the safety database and duration of exposure is considered appropriate for the evaluation of 
the general safety profile of CT-P13. The TEAEs patterns observed in the clinical studies were generally 
similar between the CT-P13 and the Remicade arms and appeared also in line with the well-characterised 
safety profile of Remicade as outlined in its SmPC. 
A numerical imbalance in serious adverse events was observed in the RA pivotal trial CT-P13 3.1 with a 
higher incidence of serious infections, including active tuberculosis. However, the numbers involved are 
small and a thorough review of all available data suggests that the observed difference was most likely a 
chance finding. Serious infections, including tuberculosis will be closely monitored on a longer term and in 
larger patient cohorts as part of post authorisation measures through registries as described in the RMP. 
Rare adverse reactions known to Remicade, such as malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders, will 
also be closely monitored as part of these registries.  
Detailed analyses of serious infusion-related reactions, including anaphylactic reaction, and vascular 
disorders, especially hypertension, did not indicate any unexpected safety signal for CT-P13.

Finally, an extensive analysis of the immunogenicity profile of CT-P13 has been conducted in the clinical 
trials, which demonstrates that the immune response to infliximab and its impact on safety and efficacy 
is comparable between CT-P13 and Remicade. 
2.6.3.  Extrapolation of efficacy and safety 
The CHMP guideline on biosimilar monoclonal antibodies (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010) states that 
extrapolation of clinical efficacy and safety data to other indications of the reference mAb, not specifically 
studied during the clinical development of the biosimilar mAb, is possible based on the overall evidence of 
comparability provided from the comparability exercise and with adequate justification. 
The Applicant provided a review of the literature on the role of TNFα in the disorders covered by the 
therapeutic indications of Remicade and the potential mechanisms of action of the various anti-TNFs. The 
mechanism of action of infliximab is complex; many questions remain unanswered and new insights into 
this mechanism should emerge in the future. The primary mode of action results from direct blocking of 
TNF receptor-mediated biological activities. Infliximab binds to soluble (s) or transmembrane (tm) TNF, 
thereby blocking their capacities to bind TNFR1 or TNFR2 and hence preventing cellular functions such as 
cell activation, cell proliferation, cytokine and chemokine production, which in turn inhibits cell 
recruitment, inflammation, immune regulation, angiogenesis, and extracellular matrix degradation. 
Several other potential mechanisms are induced by the binding of infliximab to tmTNF and include reverse 
signalling (inducing apoptosis or cytokine suppression) or cytotoxicity of the tmTNF-bearing cell by CDC 
or ADCC. While binding to s and tmTNF involves the Fab region of infliximab, the latter mechanisms 
involve binding of the molecule to complement or effector cells through its Fc region. 
It is currently believed that neutralisation of sTNF and tmTNF is responsible of its efficacy in RA by 
preventing TNF from inducing TNFR-mediated cellular functions. It can also be accepted that the effects 
of infliximab blockade on synovial inflammation are comparable in different forms of arthritis. Such 
effects are also believed to play a role in psoriasis plaques. However, more mechanisms are likely 
involved in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which are related to its binding to tmTNFα and include 
reverse signalling and Fc-related effector functions. The relative contribution of these various effects is 
currently unknown. 
The results of the extensive comparability exercise performed by the Applicant show that the only 
difference between CT-P13 and Remicade is a lower amount of afucosylated species, which results in 
lower binding to FcγRIIIa and hence lower ADCC activity in the most sensitive experimental in vitro model 
using NK cells of patients suffering from Crohn disease (CD) and with high affinity genotypes (V/V and 
V/F).  
Minor quality differences are expected to be observed between a biosimilar and its reference product and 
the CHMP guideline states that the studies should be planned with the intention to detect any potential 
differences between biosimilar and reference medicinal product and to determine the relevance of such 
differences, should they occur. 
A range of arguments and experiments enable to conclude with a high level of probability that the quality 
differences detected in the level of afucosylation and binding to FcγRIIIa are not clinically relevant. 
• 
In blood, the physiological environment, the differences in binding to FcγRIIIa and in ADCC activity 
are abolished. This has been shown by repeating the experiments in the presence of  serum of a CD 
patient, by using peripheral blood mononuclear cells preparations (rather than isolated NK cells) or by 
using whole blood. The difference in binding affinity is overcome by competition from plasma IgGs, 
soluble factors, immune complexes and the presence of mixed cell populations expressing multiple 
Inflectra  
Assessment report

Page 95/105 
 
  
FcRs. At inflammatory sites, the vascular permeability is increased, which allows for many blood 
components to enter the extravascular space. 
• 
In a system representative of the inflammatory focus in vivo using LPS-stimulated monocytes as 
target cells and PBMCs as effector cells, no ADCC response is detected with either products and 
regardless of the donor cells used (healthy volunteer or CD patient). Indeed, LPS-stimulated 
monocytes express much lower levels of tmTNFα compared with transfected Jurkat cells and these 
are not sufficient to elicit an effective ADCC response. This means that ADCC is likely to be limited in 
inflammatory settings in vivo. It is acknowledged that to date, there are no published reports 
describing the induction of ADCC by TNF antagonists in a patient. 
• 
Infliximab has been recently shown to induce a subset of regulatory macrophages (regMø) that has 
been postulated to promote gut mucosal wound healing in IBD. This model reflects the ability of 
infliximab to bind to macrophages (which express both FcγRI and FcRIIIa) through its Fc region and 
to activated T-cells expressing tmTNFα through its Fab region. Upon this binding, a distinct 
macrophage subset is induced with immunosuppressive capacities, including the production of 
anti-inflammatory cytokines and inhibition of T-cell proliferation. In this experiment using mixed 
lymphocyte reaction from FcγRIIIa genotype matched PBMCs (either healthy donors or CD patients), 
no differences in the proportion of regulatory macrophages induced and in the inhibition of T-cell 
proliferation can be detected between CT-P13 and Remicade, regardless of the FcγRIIIa genotype of 
the donor cells. This indicates that the difference in binding affinity does not affect the induction of 
regulatory macrophages. Furthermore, the monocyte/macrophages (including regMø) induced by 
CT-P13 or Remicade show the same ability to promote healing of an artificial wound made in a culture 
of colon epithelial cells. 
In addition to these experiments intended to compare Fc-related functions of CT-P13 and Remicade, an in 
vitro model relevant to IBD intended to compare Fab-related functions has been presented, which uses a 
human intestinal epithelial cell line). The data show a dose-dependent suppression of cytokine secretion 
from human epithelial  cells stimulated by a mixture of stimulators and this effect is comparable with both 
products. Likewise, CT-P13 and Remicade are similarly able to suppress apoptosis of human epithelial 
cells by blocking soluble TNFα. 
In conclusion, by using a range of experimental models that are considered representative of the 
pathophysiological conditions and putative mechanisms of action of infliximab, the Applicant has provided 
convincing evidence that the difference detected in the amount of afucosylated species has no clinically 
relevant impact on the efficacy and safety of CT-P13, in particular in IBD. Additional in vitro data from 
human intestinal cells are further supporting extrapolation of the clinical data to IBD. 
Extrapolation to IBD of the clinical data collected in AS is further supported by increasing genetic and 
immunological evidence of a clinical and histological overlap between gut inflammation in 
spondyloarthropathies and CD. Arthritis occurs in 9%-53% of patients with IBD and subclinical gut 
inflammation has been described in up to two-thirds of patients with spondyloarthropathies, with 
histologic gut inflammation found in 30%-60% of cases. 
Finally, preliminary clinical data from a very small cohort of 23 patients with CD (15) or UC (8) indicate 
similar response to CT-P13 compared with historical data on Remicade. The Applicant has extended the 
enrolment of IBD patients in this post-marketing surveillance study and will conduct an additional 
comparative trial versus Remicade in active CD.

2.9.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
In the development of a biosimilar product, there is no requirement to demonstrate benefit to the patient 
per se as this has been shown for the reference product. The benefits and risks are inferred from the 
Inflectra  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589422/2013 
Page 101/105 
 
  
 
 
 
similarity of the test product to the reference product in terms of quality, efficacy and safety. The purpose 
of a biosimilar application is to demonstrate similarity to the reference product. 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
From a quality and non-clinical perspective, it is considered that similarity between CT-P13 and Remicade 
was shown with regard to: 
• 
the primary and secondary structures of the infliximab molecule, and more specifically, the 3-D 
structure of the Fc domain; 
•  most of the glycosylation profile and degradation profile; 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the binding affinity to soluble monomeric and trimeric forms and to transmembrane TNFα; 
the activities related to binding to soluble TNFα (TNFα neutralisation, suppression of cytokine 
secretion and apoptosis in stimulated intestinal cells) and binding to transmembrane TNFα (apoptosis 
of cells overexpressing tm TNFα); 
the binding affinity to the complement component C1q, to Fcγ receptors RIa, RIIa and RIIb, and to 
FcRn; 
the binding affinity to Fcγ receptor RIIIb using the native receptors on polymorphic neutrophils 
(despite a difference detected by SPR, similar to that observed for FcRIIIa); 
the activities involving the Fc region: CDC assay, induction of regulatory macrophages and their 
effects (suppression of T-cell proliferation, wound healing of colorectal epithelium cells). 
From a clinical perspective: 
• 
• 
• 
The pivotal PK trial in patients with AS showed comparable PK profile at steady state with 90% 
confidence intervals for the ratios of both primary parameters (Cmax and AUC) ranging between 93% 
and 116%, well contained within the standard bioequivalence interval of 80% – 125%; 
The pivotal efficacy trial in patients with rheumatoid arthritis achieved its primary endpoint since the 
95% confidence interval for the difference in ACR20 was contained within the predefined equivalence 
margin (± 15%) in both the all-randomised and PP populations; 
PK data from the efficacy trial and efficacy data from the PK trial were also supportive of similarity. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
From a quality/non-clinical perspective, some differences were observed between CT-P13 and Remicade. 
• 
There is less intact IgG in the CT-P13 product, mainly due to a higher proportion of non-assembled 
form. However, the difference is so small  that it is unlikely to impact its biological activity as reflected 
by comparable TNFα binding affinity and potency. 
•  CT-P13 exhibits a higher level of C-terminal lysine variability (fewer isoforms with 2 C-terminal lysine 
residues and more isoforms with no C-terminal lysine). However, biological activity does not differ 
between these isoforms, and in any case, rapid cleavage of the C-terminal lysine occurs in blood. 
• 
There is a slightly higher level of aggregates in the CT-P13 product than in Remicade, which could 
potentially increase immunogenicity. However, this risk is considered to be negligible given the very 
low level and is not reflected in the clinical data.

•  CT-P13 exhibits a lower level of afucosylated glycans, hence a lower binding affinity to FcγRIIIa and 
a lower activity in the most sensitive ADCC assay using NK cells as effector cells and tmTNFα Jurkat 
target cells. However, no difference could be detected in several experiments that are more 
representative of pathophysiological conditions, and therefore, more relevant clinically (e.g. in blood, 
in a mixed lymphocyte reaction from FcγRIIIa genotype matched PBMCs with induction of a subset of 
regulatory macrophages, in a wound healing model using induced cells that include these 
macrophages on a culture of human colorectal epithelium cells). 
From a clinical perspective: 
• 
The efficacy of CT-P13 in RA was clearly shown to be non-inferior to that of Remicade. While the 
ACR20 results were numerically in favour of CT-P13, especially at Week 14, the 95% CIs of the 
treatment differences remained confined within the predefined equivalence margin of ±15%. 
Moreover, no such trend was observed in the AS trial. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of CT-P13 was supported mainly by the results from studies CT-P13 3.1 and CT-P13 1.1. 
The type and incidence of ADRs observed with CT-P13 and Remicade in the respective studies were 
generally similar and in line with those expected on the basis of the Remicade SmPC.  
There were no marked differences in the immunogenicity profile of CT-P13 and Remicade up to 54 weeks 
and the impact of antibodies on efficacy and safety was comparable. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
A numerical imbalance in patients with serious infections (16 vs. 10), including active tuberculosis, was 
observed with CT-P13 in comparison with Remicade. Based on a detailed analysis of these cases and 
further discussion by the Applicant about potentially impaired host defence, this difference is considered 
to be likely a chance finding. Serious infections, including TB will be closely monitored on a longer term 
and in larger set of population as part of registries as described in the RMP.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Minor quality differences are expected to be observed between a biosimilar and its reference product; 
they are acceptable as long as they do not impact efficacy and safety. 
All major physicochemical characteristics and biological activities of CT-P13 are comparable to those of 
Remicade except for a lower amount of afucosylation species, which translates in a lower binding affinity 
to FcγRIIIa receptor. This difference is not considered clinically relevant as it does not affect the activities 
of CT-P13 in the experimental models that are most relevant to the pathophysiological conditions. 
Furthermore, the contribution of ADCC to the mode of action of infliximab, or any TNF antagonist, has not 
been established in patients and ADCC may be limited in inflammatory focus in vivo, as illustrated by a 
model using LPS-stimulated monocytes as target cells and PBMCs as effector cells (no ADCC response 
detected with either products and regardless of the donor cells used, healthy volunteer or CD patient). 
Indeed, LPS-stimulated monocytes express much lower levels of tmTNFα compared with transfected 
Jurkat cells and these levels are probably not sufficient to elicit an effective ADCC response. 
In two clinical trials, the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity profiles of CT-P13 are 
similar to those of Remicade.

The numerical difference observed in serious infections, and particularly active tuberculosis, is likely to be 
a chance finding. Indeed, the relevance of this finding is questionable due to lack of adequate diagnosis 
of tuberculosis or pre-existing suspicious pulmonary lesions in a few tuberculosis cases. Moreover, other 
infections, seroconversion in the interferon-gamma release assay, and malignancies are equally 
distributed across the treatment arms. Finally, there is no plausible explanation for a difference in host 
defence from a mechanistic point of view as the risk of tuberculosis seems mainly mediated by the Fab 
region of infliximab. The Applicant will closely monitor the serious infections as part of registries as 
detailed in the RMP. 
Benefit-risk balance 
For a biosimilar, the benefit-risk conclusion is based on the totality of evidence collected from the quality, 
non-clinical, and clinical comparability exercise. For Inflectra the benefit-risk is considered positive based 
on the available data package. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
In a sensitive clinical model, the efficacy of CT-P13 was shown to be equivalent to that of Remicade. The 
general safety profile of CT-P13 was also shown to be comparable to that of Remicade and consistent with 
its SmPC. Additional data will become available to further characterise the long-term safety of CT-P13, 
including serious infectious events and tuberculosis, from the registries as well as the post-marketing 
studies as described in the RMP.   
Extrapolation of the pharmacokinetic, efficacy and safety data generated in the two clinical trials in RA 
and AS to the other indications of Remicade, including IBD, is considered possible based on the results of 
the extensive in vitro and ex vivo comparability data on all functionalities of the infliximab molecule, 
including several experiments especially relevant to IBD. It is further supported by increasing genetic and 
immunological evidence of a clinical and histological overlap between gut inflammation in 
spondyloarthropathies and CD. Finally, preliminary clinical data from a small cohort of South Korean 
patients with CD and UC indicate similar response to CT-P13 compared with historical data on Remicade. 
Post-authorisation registries and studies, including a comparative trial vs. Remicade in active CD as 
detailed in the RMP, will provide further efficacy data in the treatment of IBD.

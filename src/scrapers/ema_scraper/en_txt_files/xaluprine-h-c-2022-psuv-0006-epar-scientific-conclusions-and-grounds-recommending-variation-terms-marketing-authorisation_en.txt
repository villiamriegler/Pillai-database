Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Xaluprine, the scientific conclusions of 
PRAC are as follows:  
Xaluprine is indicated for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in children, adolescents 
and adults.  
This is the second 6-monthly PSUR relating to Xaluprine (20 mg/ml oral suspension of mercaptopurine as 
monohydrate) and covers the period between 14 September 2012 and 13 March 2013. The product is 
marketed in the UK, Ireland, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Iceland and the Netherlands. 
No new relevant information on efficacy and effectiveness in the authorised indication has become 
available during the reporting period covered by this PSUR.  
However, a cumulative review by the MAH on hepatosplenic T cell lymphoma and lymphoproliferative 
disorders, due to signal detection in the EudraVigilance (EV) database, was included in this PSUR. There 
have been 27 cases (including 14 duplicates) submitted to EV up to 13 July 2011. In two cases 
mercaptopurine was given as monotherapy.  
The originator product SmPC has a warning in section 4.4 and HSTCL labelled in section 4.8. The 
evaluation of the signal requires an update of the SmPC. The MAH should submit a detailed SmPC with an 
update of sections 4.4 and 4.8 in accordance with the recommended changes specified in Annex I. An 
update of the Patient leaflet is also proposed.  
Review of the safety information received during the period covered by this PSUR indicates that the 
current risk / benefit ratio for Xaluprine remains acceptable. 
The next PSUR should be submitted in accordance with the requirements set out in the list of Union 
reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and published on 
the European medicines web-portal. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Xaluprine, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance MERCAPTOPURINE is favourable subject 
to the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

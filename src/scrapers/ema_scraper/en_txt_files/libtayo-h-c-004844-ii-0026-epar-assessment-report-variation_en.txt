2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Claimed the therapeutic indication 
The initially claimed indication was for LIBTAYO as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with 
recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer with disease progression on or after platinum-based 
chemotherapy. 
The recommended indication is for LIBTAYO as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer and disease progression on or after platinum-based 
chemotherapy. 
The recommended dose is 350 mg cemiplimab every 3 weeks (Q3W) administered as an intravenous 
infusion over 30 minutes. 
Treatment may be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (see SmPC section 4.2). 
Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Cervical cancer is the fourth most frequently diagnosed cancer in women and the fourth highest cause of 
cancer death in women, with an estimated global incidence of 604,000 new cases and 342,000 deaths 
globally in 2020 (Sung, 2021). The highest incidence rates are in the Caribbean, Africa, Eastern Europe, 
and South America (Forman, 2012). In 2018 the world aged-standardized incidence rate (per 100,000 
women) ranged from 6.8 in Western Europe to 16.0 in Central-eastern Europe (Arbyn, 2020). The most 
significant cause of cervical cancer is persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.  
Screening with the Papanicolaou (Pap) test since the 1950s, with subsequent incorporation of HPV DNA 
testing, has been associated with decreased cervical cancer mortality in the US and other developed 
countries (Wang, 2004). Although vaccination against high risk strains of HPV is projected to gradually 
decrease the global incidence of cervical cancer in the coming decades, the burden of this disease 
remains profound (Simms, 2019).   
Biologic features 
Squamous cell carcinomas account for approximately 70%–80% of cervical cancers and adenocarcinomas 
for 20%–25% (ESMO Clinical practice guideline on Cervical Cancer). 
These histologic subtypes differ substantially in terms of HPV and mutation status (HPV16 for SCC, HPV18 
for adenocarcinoma), immune infiltrate, response to therapy, and patient outcome. Several retrospective 
studies showed that patients with adenocarcinoma have a higher risk of developing metastases, resulting 
in a poorer prognosis (Rotman J, 2020). 
Approximately 5–11% of all cervical cancers are reported to be HPV-negative, which can be attributed to 
truly negative and false-negative results. The truly HPV-negative cervical cancers are almost all cervical 
adenocarcinomas with unclear aetiology (Xing B, 2021). 
Assessment report  
EMA/862705/2022 
Page 9/137 
 
 
 
 
Cervical carcinoma may evade immune response by expression of PD-L1 (programmed-death ligand 1), 
the ligand for the immune-checkpoint receptor PD-1 (programmed death-1) on T cells (Heeren, 2016). 
Additionally, analysis of TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) for expression of selected genes (PD-1, PD-L1, 
CD8A) showed that cervical cancer clusters with other tumour types for which anti-PD-1 therapy 
improves overall survival (Rischin D, 2020). 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Almost half of the newly diagnosed adult cervical cancer patients have Stage I localized cancer, with a 5-
year survival rate of over 90%. Five-year survival rates decrease with stage at diagnosis, becoming as 
low as 15-17% for metastatic disease (Lorin, 2015; Munich cancer registry 2016; SEER Cervical Cancer).  
Following treatment of early-stage cervical cancer, distant metastases or multiple recurrence sites 
develop in 15% to 61% of patients, usually within the first two years of completing treatment. Recurrent 
cervical cancer presents as disease isolated to the pelvis (locoregional recurrence) or with disease 
involving other organs or outside the pelvis. If a vaginal recurrence is suspected, the area of concern 
should be biopsied to prove recurrent disease. All patients suspected of recurrent disease should undergo 
positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) for evaluation of local and distant 
disease.  
Management 
Treatment options for cervical cancer in adults include surgery (conization, hysterectomy, pelvic 
exenteration), radiation, and chemotherapy alone or in combination, depending on the stage of the 
disease (ESMO Guideline). For patients with a local recurrence, surgical resection is recommended, rather 
than nonsurgical approaches, if they are appropriate surgical candidates based on tumour recurrence, 
age, and comorbidities. In select patients, surgical resection may present a curative option. However, for 
patients with a local recurrence who have not received radiation therapy (RT), RT in combination with 
chemotherapy is an acceptable alternative, and is preferred in those who are not surgical candidates, 
provided they have not previously undergone pelvic or intravaginal RT. For women with recurrent cervical 
cancer and who are not surgical candidates, and for those who present with metastatic disease, systemic 
therapy is recommended. 
Cisplatin was the first established systemic therapy for treatment of recurrent or metastatic (R/M) 
cervical cancer, but single agent activity was modest (Eskander, 2014) (Tewari, 2019). Cisplatin-based 
doublets with topotecan or paclitaxel have shown superiority to cisplatin monotherapy in terms of 
response rate and PFS, especially in patients previously exposed to CRT where cisplatin was used as 
radiosensitizer (Moore, 2004; Long, 2005; ESMO Guideline).  
The addition of bevacizumab, a monoclonal directed against vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-
A), to doublet chemotherapy study improved overall survival (OS) compared to doublet chemotherapy 
alone in the GOG-240 study (16.8 vs 13.3 months; hazard ratio [HR 0.77]) (Tewari, 2017; EPAR 
Avastin).   
Carboplatin + paclitaxel was reported to have a more favourable toxicity profile than cisplatin + paclitaxel 
and was associated with non-inferior OS in a phase 3 study (Kitagawa, 2015). Carboplatin + paclitaxel 
(with bevacizumab, if appropriate) may be the preferred first line treatment for recurrent/metastatic 
(R/M) cervical cancer for patients that are not candidates for cisplatin (ESMO Guideline). Topotecan + 
paclitaxel (with bevacizumab, if appropriate) may also be considered for patients who are not platinum 
candidates (Tewari, 2014b) (Tewari, 2017).   
Assessment report  
EMA/862705/2022

The role of frontline immunotherapy in cervical cancer has recently been established. Pembrolizumab, a 
humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to human programmed cell death 1 (PD 1), was recently 
approved in EU in combination with chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab, for the treatment of 
persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer in adults whose tumours express PD L1 with a 
Combined Positive Score (CPS) ≥ 1 (EPAR Keytruda).  
In patients progressing following first-line therapy, different cytostatic agents, including vinorelbine, 
topotecan, gemcitabine or nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel have been evaluated. However, 
response rates were low and duration of responses was short. Therefore, no ESMO recommendation is 
given about the most effective second-line treatment (ESMO Guideline). No systemic therapy has been 
associated with improvement in OS. Patients who progress following 1L chemotherapy and those who are 
not candidates for combination therapy, might be candidates for single-agent therapy. A choice among 
active agents must be tailored to the individual patient, with consideration to prior therapies received, 
residual toxicity, and performance status.  
The following response rates have been reported in the literature with single agents:  
•  Carboplatin – ORR 15% (Weiss, 1990). 
•  Paclitaxel (175 mg/m2 IV every three weeks with dose reduction to 135 mg/m2 if patients received 
prior RT), ORR 20 to 25% (McGuire, 1996; Curtin, 2001; Kudelka, 1997). 
•  Topotecan (1.5 mg/m2 IV daily for five days every 21 days) – ORR 19% (Thigpen, 2003; Bookman, 
2000; Muderspach 2001; Abu-Rustum 2000). 
•  Nanoparticle, albumin-bound paclitaxel (125 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days) – ORR 29%t 
(Alberts 2012). 
•  Vinorelbine (30 mg/m2 intravenous [IV] push weekly for two weeks every 21 days) – ORR 15% 
(Morris, 1998; Lacava, 1997; Muggia 2004). 
•  Pemetrexed (900 mg/m2 IV every three weeks) – ORR 15% (Miller, 2008; Lorusso 2010). 
•  Ifosfamide (1.2 g/m2 IV daily for five days every 28 days) – ORR 22 percent (Thigpen, 2003; Sutton 
1996). 
• 
Irinotecan (350 mg/m2 IV every three weeks, or 125 mg/m2 weekly for four weeks followed by a two-
week washout period) – ORR 15 percent (Look, 1998; Lhommé, 1999). 
•  Tisotumab vedotin (2 mg/kg intravenously every three weeks) was studied in a single-arm trial of 101 
patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer who had received no more than two prior 
systemic regimens in the recurrent or metastatic setting, including at least one prior platinum-based 
chemotherapy regimen. ORR to tisotumab was 24% (Coleman, 2021).  
•  Pembrolizumab (200 mg IV every three weeks) was evaluated in a single-arm trial KEYNOTE-158 
including 82 patients from a cohort of patients with advanced, pretreated cervical cancer and PD-L1 
expression of 1 percent or more. Pembrolizumab showed ORR of 15% (Chung, 2019; FDA Label for 
Keytruda). Similar findings were observed in the KEYNOTE-028 trial, in which the ORR was 17% 
percent and duration of response was 5.4 months (Frenel, 2017). 
Tisotumab vedotin and pembrolizumab are not currently approved in EU in the post-chemotherapy setting 
of cervical cancer.

2.1.2.  About the product 
Cemiplimab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and blocks its 
interaction with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed death-ligand 2 (PD-L2). In Europe, 
cemiplimab is currently approved for the treatment of advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma 
(CSCC), basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and first line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with 
PD-L1 ≥ 50% and no genetic drivers.  
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
Development program for cemiplimab in cervical cancer:  
In the first-in-human (FIH) study with cemiplimab, R2810-ONC-1423, durable anti-tumour responses 
were observed among patients with advanced cervical cancer. Among the 23 patients combined from the 
dose escalation and expansion cohorts, ORR was 17% (4/23) by investigator assessment. Durations of 
the 4 responses were >1 year in 2 patients, and 11.2 months, and 6.4 months, respectively in the other 
2 patients. The FIH experience with cemiplimab suggested that PD-1 blockade produces a modest 
response rate in ≥2L cervical cancer, and that these responses are often durable.  Although the ORR of 
cemiplimab in this setting may be similar to that of chemotherapy, the potential for durable responses 
with cemiplimab was hypothesized to translate into an OS benefit (versus chemotherapy) in a phase 3 
randomized trial. Study R2810-ONC-1676 was designed to test this hypothesis. 
The MAH received Scientific advice from the CHMP on 21 April 2017 (EMEA/H/SA/3225/4/2017/II). The 
overall recommendations from the CHMP were followed along design and conduct of the pivotal trial. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The MAH declared that the clinical studies presented in this application were conducted in accordance 
with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and that are consistent with 
the International Council for Harmonisation guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and applicable regulatory 
requirements. Consultations with health authorities in the US and EU have been conducted regarding the 
clinical development program and study design. Furthermore, it was stated that no inspections have 
occurred for trial R2810-ONC-1676 and none are currently planned. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
A claim of exclusion from preparation of environmental risk assessment studies was made according to 
Section 2 of the 2006 CHMP Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for 
Human Use (ERA Guideline EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2) because cemiplimab is a monoclonal 
antibody consisting of linked naturally occurring amino acids. Per the ERA Guideline, "Vitamins, 
electrolytes, amino acids, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids are exempted because they are 
unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment." 
Assessment report  
EMA/862705/2022 
Page 12/137 
 
 
 
 
The Applicant concluded that, the claim for ERA exemption was justified and in conformity with the ERA 
guideline since the marketing authorisation request concerned a monoclonal antibody consisting of 
naturally occurring amino acids. Cemiplimab is significantly metabolized in vivo and is expected to be 
readily and rapidly degraded in wastewater treatment systems and in the environment. The antibody's 
structure and mode of action do not indicate any specific risk to the environment. 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The MAH provided a justification in accordance with the Guideline on the environmental risk assessment 
of medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2) for not submitting ERA studies. 
Cemiplimab is a protein composed of natural amino acids. Proteins are biodegradable in the environment 
and thus do not pose any environmental risk. Therefore, according to the “Guideline on the environmental 
risk assessment of medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2), it is acceptable 
that no ERA studies were submitted for cemiplimab. 
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Considering its nature, cemiplimab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The proposed dose of cemiplimab is 350 mg Q3W administered as an IV infusion over 30 minutes until 
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. This cemiplimab dosing regimen is currently approved for 
the treatment of advanced CSCC, BCC and first line treatment of NSCLC. 
The clinical pharmacology package included data from pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, 
exposure-response (E-R) for efficacy and safety, and immunogenicity assessment of cemiplimab in the 
target population. The MAH also submitted PK data assessing consistency across studies in the R/M 
cervical cancer and by histology (SCC vs AC), as well as PK data in other patient populations (tumour-
types) that have been previously reported. 
Within the population of patients with R/M cervical cancer, the PK of cemiplimab was assessed across 
studies (Study 1423 and Study 1676), as well as between patients. 
Table 1 provides a summary of the clinical studies that were conducted in patients with R/M cervical 
cancer. 
Study 1676 
Study 1676 is an open-label, randomized, multicenter, phase 3 study to compare the OS in patients with 
R/M cervical cancer that had progressed after platinum-containing chemotherapy, treated with either 
cemiplimab (REGN2810) as monotherapy at 350 mg Q3W IV or with investigator’s choice (IC) 
chemotherapy. R/M cervical cancer patients with SCC and AC histology were enrolled in this study. All 
patients underwent screening procedures to determine eligibility within 28 days prior to initial 
administration of cemiplimab or chemotherapy. After the screening period, patients received up to 
96 weeks of treatment, consisting of 16 cycles of 6 weeks each. This study has completed enrollment and 
is ongoing at the time of this application. The percent change from baseline in tumour target lesions was 
assessed as a pharmacodynamic marker of efficacy.

Blood samples for assessment of cemiplimab concentrations and detection of immunogenicity in serum 
were collected at various pre-specified times over the treatment period according to the study schedule. 
Blood samples for drug concentrations assessment were collected using a sparse sampling schedule: pre-
dose and post-dose on day 1 of cycle 1, then pre-dose and post-dose on day 1 of cycles 2 through cycle 
6, and cycles 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15. Blood samples were also collected at follow-up visit 1 (approximately 
30 days after the last dose of cemiplimab) collection of a blood sample at follow-up visit 2 (approximately 
4 months after the last dose of cemiplimab) was optional. 
The numbers of patients with R/M cervical cancer in the Study 1676 primary analysis sets are presented 
in Table 2.

Pharmacokinetic results 
Observed cemiplimab PK parameters in patients with R/M cervical cancer in the cemiplimab group in 
Study 1676 are summarized in Table 3. Steady state was reached by week 12 in the overall population 
of patients with R/M cervical cancer upon repeated cemiplimab 350 mg Q3W IV dosing and maintained 
throughout the period. As such, week 18 was selected as the representative time point to report steady-
state concentrations. Cemiplimab exposure (Ctrough and Cmax, mean [SD]) at steady state in the overall 
population of patients with R/M cervical cancer ranged between a Ctrough of 65.6 (30.0) mg/L and a Cmax of 
186 (60.8) mg/L. Cemiplimab PK parameters were similar in the subpopulations of patients with histology 
types SCC and AC.

First-in-Human Study 1423 in Patients with Various Tumour Types 
The FIH Study 1423 evaluated a range of cemiplimab doses (dose escalation phase: 1 to 10 mg/kg 
Q2W IV), included dense sampling for measurement of PK parameters after the first dose, and enrolled 
patients with multiple solid tumour types (including CSCC, BCC, NSCLC, and R/M cervical cancer), 
allowing for comparison of PK parameters across tumour types. This study also included comparison of PK 
parameters for cemiplimab administered as monotherapy or combination therapy (cemiplimab plus 
radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy). 
Study Design 
Study 1423 was a FIH, open-label study in patients with advanced solid tumours to evaluate repeat IV 
dosing with cemiplimab, as monotherapy and as combination therapy (with radiotherapy and/or 
chemotherapy). The study consisted of both 1a dose escalation phase and a dose expansion phase. 
Patients were eligible to receive up to 48 weeks of treatment, after which there was a 24-week follow-up 
period. The 48 weeks of treatment consisted of up to 6 cycles of 8 weeks each. In the dose escalation 
phase, 60 patients were each assigned to 1 of 3 dose escalation cohorts (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, or 10 mg/kg 
Q2W administered IV as monotherapy or in combination with other anti-cancer treatments (radiotherapy 
and/or chemotherapy). During dose escalation, safety was assessed, and no maximum tolerated dose 
was identified. The expansion phase, which included 24 cohorts, assessed the PK, immunogenicity, 
safety, and efficacy of cemiplimab in different tumour types after dosing as monotherapy or in 
combination with other anti-cancer treatments (radiotherapy or chemotherapy). 
The descriptive PK of cemiplimab in serum using dense sampling after the first dose was evaluated by 
Non compartmental analysis (NCA) and during the treatment and follow-up periods. 
Pharmacokinetic Results 
A total of 23 patients with R/M cervical cancer were enrolled in Study 1423: 3 patients in dose escalation 
cohorts where tumour type was not specified in the data base and these patients were therefore reported 
as ‘all solid tumours’: 2 patients at 1 mg/kg Q2W and 1 patient at 3 mg/kg Q2W (Papadopoulos, 2020), 
and 20 patients in the expansion cohorts EXP23 and EXP24 that were identified with R/M cervical cancer 
in the database: 10 patients in expansion cohort 23 (EXP23) who received cemiplimab 3 mg/kg Q2W as 
monotherapy, and 10 patients in expansion cohort 24 (EXP24), who received cemiplimab 3 mg/kg Q2W 
with radiotherapy (XRT 9 Gy x 3). The ORR was 10% in EXP23 and 10% in EXP24. 
Overall, the PK of cemiplimab was linear and dose-proportional over a dosing range of 1 to 10 mg/kg 
Q2W IV in Study 1423.

Similarity in the observed cemiplimab exposure (Ctrough and Cmax) at 3 mg/kg Q2W after the first dose and 
at steady state across patients with different tumour types in Study 1423 is presented in Table 5.

Steady State in Patients with R/M Cervical Cancer compared to Patients with 
Other Solid Tumour Types Receiving Cemiplimab 3 mg/kg Q2W as Monotherapy 
or in Combination Therapy (Study 1423) 
As previously demonstrated to support switch of dosing regimens from 3 mg/kg Q2W to 350 mg Q3W, 
the observed cemiplimab concentrations (Ctrough and Cmax) at steady state were similar in patients 
receiving 350 mg Q3W compared to patients receiving 3 mg/kg Q2W IV as presented in   
Table 6 for individual studies and combined data for each dose level across studies.  
Observed cemiplimab exposure (Ctrough and Cmax) during therapy at 350 mg Q3W was also compared 
between patients with R/M cervical cancer in Study 1676 and patients with advanced CSCC, BCC, and 
NSCLC in the respective pivotal studies. Cemiplimab exposure was compared across tumor types over 
time (Figure 4) and at steady state ( 
Figure 3); numerical results are summarized in  
Table 6.  
Based on the popPK model, at 350 mg Q3W, the mean cemiplimab concentrations at steady-state ranged 
between a Ctrough of 59 mg/l and a concentration at end of infusion (Cmax) of 171 mg/l. Steady state 
exposure is achieved after approximately 4 months of treatment.

Population PK analyses 
The primary objectives of the population PK analysis were to:  
1.  Update the existing population PK model for cemiplimab in patients with advanced cutaneous 
squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), basal cell carcinoma (BCC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or 
other solid tumour types from studies R2810-ONC-1423, R2810-ONC-1540, R2810-ONC-1620 and 
R2810-ONC-1624 (referred to as Studies 1423, 1540, 1620 and 1624).  
2.  Identify and quantify the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic covariates, which may explain variability in 
PK parameters in the updated model.  
3.  Perform an external validation of cemiplimab PK patients with cervical cancer (CC) from Study R2810-
ONC-1676 (referred to as Study 1676) to assess consistency in cemiplimab PK across various solid 
tumour types.  
The population PK of cemiplimab was previously described by a 2-compartment model with zero-order IV 
infusion and first-order elimination, which included a sigmoid Emax function to describe time-varying 
change in clearance (CL), and an additive and proportional residual error model. The previous population 
PK model was based on data from Studies 1423, 1540, 1620 and 1624, which consisted of 1062 patients 
and 17193 PK samples, whereas the updated model included a total of 1063 patients and 17312 post-
dose PK samples. Data summaries of number of patients and post-dose cemiplimab concentrations can be 
seen across study, dose regimen and tumour type in Table 7 and Table 8.

Table 8: Summary of Population by Tumor Type in the Population PK Analysis for 1063 Patients 
All cemiplimab post-dose PK samples were included in the master dataset but data below the lower limit 
of quantification (LLOQ) was omitted from the analysis (M1-method). In total, 81 samples (0.5%) of 
post-dose concentrations were below the LLOQ and omitted from the analysis. Observations with absolute 
conditional weighted residuals (CWRES) or absolute individual weighted residuals (IWRES) above 5 were 
classified as outliers. The dataset did not exclude observations previously identified as concentration 
outliers. Data excluded from the analysis dataset included (1) inversion samples, (2) duplicated PK 
samples, (3) missing PK observations and (4) PK observations with unknown or missing sampling 
information. A total of 1390 PK samples were excluded from the population PK analysis (Table 9).  
Table 9: Summary of Data Excluded from the Population PK Analysis for 1063 Patients 
The population PK of cemiplimab were characterized by non-linear mixed-effects modelling using 
NONMEM (Version 7.4, ICON Development Solutions, Ellicott City, Maryland). Dataset was constructed 
using SAS (Version 9.4). Statistical software R (Version 4.0.2) was used for data post-processing and 
figures.

Base model 
The population PK base model of cemiplimab was previously described by a 2-compartment model with 
zero-order intravenous infusion, a first-order elimination, and a sigmoid Emax function to describe a time-
varying change in CL. However, the updated model did not include body weight on CL, volume of 
distribution in the central compartment (Vc) on CL or time-varying albumin on CL in the structural model, 
as these were evaluated in the covariate selection process. The interindividual variability (IIV) terms on 
Emax and T50 from were removed from the updated base model as data could not sufficiently support the 
estimation of IIV for these parameters. The off-diagonal covariance between inter-individual random 
effects on inter-compartmental clearance (CLQ) and volume of central compartment/volume of peripheral 
compartment (V1V2) was also removed. The residual error model was simplified from the previous model 
to include only a log-additive residual error term. In the base model, the approximate percent coefficient 
of variation (CV%) were 39.2% and 30.1% and ETA-shrinkage were 5.6% and 7.2% for CLQ and V1V2, 
respectively.  
Covariate model 
Potential extrinsic and intrinsic covariates that are predictive of cemiplimab PK variability were tested 
using a step-wise approach, which included both forward selection and backward elimination. Covariates 
that improved goodness-of-fit (GOF) as determined by the objective function value (OFV) were retained 
in the forward selection using: 
 and in backward elimination: 
. Furthermore, covariates were also evaluated by successful minimization and covariance

significance. Baseline IgG and baseline PDL-1 expression were analysed in a post-hoc covariate analysis. 
An increase in CL was predicted with increasing baseline IgG, however the exponent of IgG on CL was 
similar to the previous population PK model and therefore not anticipated to result in a meaningful effect 
on exposure. PDL-1 expression did not appear to have a meaningful effect on baseline CL or steady-state 
clearance.  
The covariates that were retained in the final covariate model were: body weight, sex, time-varying 
albumin, baseline ALT, CSCC tumour type, and BCC tumour type on CL; baseline body weight, sex and 
baseline albumin on V1; BCC tumour type on Emax; and other tumour type on T50.  
Final model 
PK parameter estimates of the updated final model can be seen in Table 10. Parameters in the final model 
were estimated with percent relative standard errors (%RSE) below 8%. ETA-shrinkage increased slightly 
from 5.6% and 7.2% to 7.8% and 8.5% for CLQ and V1V2, respectively. IIV terms for CLQ and V1V2 and 
residual error were reduced as compared to the base model. Cemiplimab clearance had an inverse linear 
relationship with time-varying albumin level, which indicates lower clearance as albumin levels increase. 
Also, cemiplimab demonstrated weight-dependent clearance. As with the previous model, NSCLC patients 
had higher CL, which led to lower exposure than in patients with CSCC or BCC. Estimated exponents for 
CLQ and V1V2 with body weight were 0.539 and 0.499, respectively.

External validation of Study 1676 
The updated population PK model was used to externally validate cemiplimab PK in 295 patients from 
Study 1676 by means of posterior predictive check (PPC). Study 1676 (data cut-off date: 4th of January 
2021) consisted of adult females ≥ 18 years old with recurrent, persistent, and/or metastatic CC who 
received cemiplimab as monotherapy, administered 350 mg IV once every 3 weeks (Q3W). 3 patients 
had no quantifiable concentrations and were not included in the external validation. Study 1676 therefore 
comprised of 292 patients with 2030 PK samples. Summary of data exclusion in the external validation 
can be seen in Table 11.  
Table 11: Summary of Data Excluded from the Population PK External Validation 
A smoothed parametric bootstrap procedure was utilised to incorporate uncertainty in parameter 
estimates. Parameter estimates from the updated final model was assumed to have a multivariate normal 
distribution with the mean vector set to the population parameter estimates and the covariance matrix 
set to the covariance matrix of the estimates from the updated model. The multivariate normal 
distribution was utilised as an approximate posterior distribution to generate 500 sets of population 
parameter values, which were then used to simulate datasets that replicated the design, subject 
population, dose regimen, sample size and covariate distribution for Study 1676. From the simulated 
datasets conditioned upon the observed study design, 90% confidence intervals were calculated and 
overlaid for the 5th, 50th and 95th percentiles of observed cemiplimab concentrations. The result of the 
PPC can be seen in Figure 7.

comparison across studies above. Volume (Vd) after the first dose could only be assessed by NCA in 4/10 
patients in EXP23 and in 3/10 patients in EXP24 in study 1423 and ranged from 3.1 L to 5.3 L.  
Based on the PopPK model, cemiplimab is primarily distributed in the vascular system with a volume of 
distribution at steady-state (Vss) of 5.35.9 l. Median Tmax occurs at the end of the 30-minute infusion. 
Elimination 
Linear elimination and with a time varying decrease in clearance was described. Please refer description 
of individual studies and comparison across studies above. 
Clearance after the first dose could only be assessed by NCA in 4/10 patients in EXP23 and in 3/10 
patients in EXP24 in study 1423 and ranged from 0.24 L/day to 0.37 L/day. 
Based on the popPK model, clearance of cemiplimab is linear at doses of 1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg every two 
weeks. Cemiplimab clearance after the first dose is approximately 0.25 l/day. The total clearance appears 
to decrease by approximately 11% over time, resulting in a steady state clearance (CLss) of 0.22 l/day; 
the decrease in CL is not considered clinically relevant. The within dosing interval half-life at steady state 
is 22 days.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Pharmacodynamic Results in Patients with R/M Cervical Cancer 
Due to the insufficient number of patients with R/M cervical cancer in the FIH Study 1423 (2 responders 
out of 20 patients total in EXP23 and EXP24), pharmacodynamic analysis was performed exclusively in 
patients with R/M cervical cancer in the pivotal Study 1676. Data for patients on cemiplimab therapy are 
presented here for all patients with R/M cervical cancer (N=304) and the subgroup with SCC histology 
(N=239) on cemiplimab 350 mg Q3W. 
In Study 1676, the percent change from baseline in target lesions was assessed as a pharmacodynamic 
marker of efficacy using radiologic imaging according to RECIST 1.1. Patients with confirmed response 
status of CR or PR according to RECIST 1.1 contributed to ORR (50 responders in the total patient 
population and 42 in the subgroup with SCC histology).  
Spider plots provide a comprehensive perspective regarding the depth and kinetics of responses, 
illustrating the percent changes in target lesion measurements over time for individual patients. Spider 
plots for changes in target lesions relative to baseline were provided for patients who received 
cemiplimab 350 mg Q3W in the SCC subgroup (Figure 8) and the total population (Figure 9).  
In the SCC histology subgroup, as well as in the total population, the estimated median DOR was 16.4 
months in patients receiving cemiplimab 350 mg Q3W.

Exposure-Response Relationships in Patients with R/M Cervical Cancer in the Pivotal Study 
1676 
Descriptive and model-based E-R relationships analyses were conducted for efficacy and safety endpoints 
using post-hoc estimates of exposure metrics Ctrough, Cmax, and average concentration (Cav) after the first 
dose, with emphasis on Ctrough for efficacy endpoints and on Cmax for safety endpoints, as considered to be 
the most sensitive exposure metrics for these clinical assessments.  
E-R relationship analyses for efficacy were conducted on OS as primary endpoint, and PFS, ORR (based 
on BOR), and DOR as secondary endpoints, while E-R relationships for safety were conducted on 
immune-mediated adverse event (irAEs) (all and grade ≥3) as safety endpoints. 
E-R relationship analyses for efficacy and safety, performed on patients with R/M cervical cancer from 
Study 1676 who received cemiplimab 350 mg Q3W are presented in this section. 
Exposure-Response Relationship Analyses for Efficacy 
In the descriptive exposure-efficacy analysis, Kaplan-Meier curves of OS by quartile of Ctrough after the 
first dose (Ctrough,1) is presented in Figure 10 .

Figure 10: Kaplan-Meier Curves of OS Stratified by Quartiles of Individual Predicted 
Cemiplimab Ctrough After the First Dose in Patients with R/M Cervical Cancer 
To address the limitations associated with the descriptive E-R analysis (K-M analysis of OS by Ctrough,1), a 
Cox proportional hazards (PH) model was implemented. This Cox PH modelling showed that Ctrough,1 was 
a significant predictor of OS hazard when it was the sole predictor in the model (Table 23), but after 
adjusting for baseline values of albumin, weight, and ECOG performance status, Ctrough,1 was no longer 
significant since the 95% confidence interval for the hazard ratio (HR) contains 1 (Figure 11).

Exposure metrics between “responders” and “all others” were unlikely to differ from one another due to 
the overlapping distribution of values and comparable mean and median values ( 
Figure 14). Logistic regression models with BOR as the response and continuous exposure metric as the 
independent variable showed a flat relationship in both the fitted model and in the trend of observed data 
(Figure 15). Additionally, univariate logistic regression models compared to the intercept-only model did 
not reveal any advantage over the intercept-only model ( 
Table 24).

Exposure-Response Relationships for Safety 
The exposure-safety relationship analyses for all irAEs and irAEs grade ≥3 with Cmax after the first dose 
(Cmax,1) as the representative exposure metric for safety were conducted in all patients with R/M cervical 
cancer in Study 1676. In addition, average concentration after the first dose (Cav,1) and Ctrough after the 
first dose (Ctrough,1) were also evaluated.

across all clinical studies in patients with solid tumors (Studies 1423, 1540, 1620, 1624, and 1676). 
Immunogenicity 
Study 1676 
Immunogenicity in patients with R/M cervical cancer in the anti-drug antibody (ADA) data set (N=206) 
was low with no apparent difference in the occurrence of immunogenicity (ADA) in patients with SCC and 
AC. Pre-existing ADA occurred in 6 patients with R/M cervical cancer (2.9%). Treatment-emergent ADA 
(1.9% in total) was observed in 4 patients with SCC, 1 was transient and 3 were indeterminate; all were 
low titers (<1,000). None of the ADA-positive samples revealed the presence of neutralizing antibody. No 
effect of immunogenicity/ADA on exposure was observed in patients with R/M cervical cancer in this 
study.  
Study 1423 
Among 337 patients in the ADA Analysis Set in Study 1423, ADA incidence was low, with treatment-
emergent ADA in 9 patients (2.7%). Treatment-emergent ADA was reported in 9 patients (1 patient at 1 
mg/kg Q2W, 7 patients at 3 mg/kg Q2W, and 1 patient at 10 mg/kg Q2W): persistent ADA was observed 
in 2 patients (1 at 1 mg/kg Q2W and 1 at 3 mg/kg Q2W), transient ADA was observed in 2 patients (both 
at 3 mg/kg Q2W) and indeterminate ADA was observed in 5 patients (4 at 3 mg/kg Q2W and 1 at 10 
mg/kg Q2W). The ADA titers were generally low with only 1 patient exhibiting moderate ADA titer. No 
patients were positive for NAbs. No relationship was observed between ADA status and cemiplimab 
exposure in the few cases of treatment-emergent ADA. 
Of the patients with R/M cervical cancer in the ADA Analysis Set in Study 1423, 1 patient at 10 mg/kg 
Q2W of the 3 patients in the dose escalation cohorts, and none of the patients in EXP 23 (n=7) and EXP 
24 (n=7) at 3 mg/kg Q3W showed a positive ADA response.  
Immunogenicity in Patients with R/M Cervical Cancer from Study 1676 
Immunogenicity in patients with R/M cervical cancer in Study 1676 (206 patients, including 164 patients 
with SCC histology and 42 patients with AC histology), was low with no apparent difference in the

occurrence of immunogenicity (ADA) based on histology. Pre-existing ADA occurred in 6 patients with 
R/M cervical cancer (2.9%). Treatment-emergent ADA (1.9% in total) was observed in 4 patients with 
SCC, 1 was transient and 3 were indeterminate; all were low titers (<1,000). None of the ADA-positive 
samples revealed the presence of neutralizing antibodies. No effect of immunogenicity/ADA on 
cemiplimab exposure was observed in patients with R/M cervical cancer in this study.  
Immunogenicity in All Patients with Solid Tumours 
In the overall population of patients with solid tumours, immunogenicity was assessed in patients with 
solid tumours, including patients with R/M cervical cancer, after cemiplimab administration as 
monotherapy (Studies 1423, 1540, 1620, 1624 and 1676) or in combination with radiotherapy and/or 
chemotherapy (Study 1423).   
The incidence of treatment-emergent ADA in all patients with solid tumours in the ADA analysis set 
(n=1029) was low (2.1%). Only 3 patients (0.3%) had a persistent ADA response: 1 patient at 1 mg/kg 
Q2W IV, 1 patient at 3 mg/kg Q2W IV, and 1 patient at 350 mg Q3W IV. The ADA titers were generally 
low. No patients were positive for NAbs. The incidence of treatment-emergent ADA in the subset of 
patients (n=591) who received cemiplimab 350 mg Q3W IV was similarly low (2.2%).

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology data package submitted in support of the proposed indication for cemiplimab in 
patients with R/M cervical cancer included data on PK, PD, E-R relationships for efficacy and safety, and 
immunogenicity of cemiplimab in the target population. The PK was also assessed for consistency across 
studies in the R/M cervical cancer and by histology (SCC vs. AC), as well as in other patient populations 
(tumour-types) that have been previously reported. Within the population of patients with R/M cervical 
cancer, the PK of cemiplimab was assessed across studies (Study 1423 and Study 1676), as well as 
between patients. 
The previous population PK model for cemiplimab in patients with CSCC, BCC, NSCLC and other solid 
tumours was updated with data from Study 1423, 1540, 1620 and 1624, which comprised of 17312 
samples from 1063 patients.  
Consistent with the initial population PK model, the pharmacokinetics of cemiplimab could be described by 
a 2-compartment model with zero-order intravenous infusion, a first-order elimination, and a sigmoid 
Emax function to describe a time-varying change in CL. Interindividual variability terms on Emax and T50 
were removed, the proportional error model was refined to a log-additive error model and the off-
diagonal covariance between interindividual random effects on CLQ and V1V2 was removed. The 
population PK model was evaluated adequately by means of GOF-plots, bootstrap analysis and VPCs. 
Model stability was significantly improved (94.8% successful convergence rate in the bootstrap analysis). 
The suitability of the updated final population PK model in predicting cemiplimab concentrations in 
patients with CC was evaluated through an external PPC, which indicated that the updated model 
adequately described cemiplimab concentrations in patients with cervical cancer.  
Descriptive analyses at the study level showed that the PK of cemiplimab in patients with R/M cervical 
cancer receiving 3 mg/kg Q2W IV in the FIH Study 1423 was comparable to that observed in patients 
with R/M cervical cancer receiving 350 mg Q3W IV in the pivotal Study 1676. Within Study 1676, the PK 
was also observed to be similar between patients with SCC and AC histology types. 
Consistently across tumour types the concentration-time profiles over the dosing interval was 
characterized by initial brief distribution phase followed by a mono-exponential elimination phase. 
Attainment of steady-state was determined by inspection of the concentration-time profiles and 
attainment of a plateau of Ctrough. From history it was expected for a monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed 
against PD-1 with observed linear kinetics at the defined dose level and dosing interval, steady-state was 
achieved by week 18 (i.e., after approximately 4 months of cemiplimab IV administration). Furthermore, 
predicted AUC3W after the fifth and sixth 350 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W) intravenous (IV) doses of 
cemiplimab showed that >90% and >95% of the exposure at plateau were reached after the fifth and 
sixth cemiplimab Q3W IV dose, respectively. The PopPK approach supported the selection of week 18 to 
report descriptive cemiplimab concentrations at steady state in the clinical pharmacology report of Study 
REGN2810-ONC-1676 (Study 1676).   
Cemiplimab exposure data in special populations were also presented. Exposure at steady state in special 
populations between the target population of patients with R/M cervical cancer (292 patients in Study 
1676) vs. the PopPK population (1062 patients) was compared for age, renal function, hepatic function, 
and baseline albumin, respectively.  
No additional information or impact on exposures was observed on age, moderate or severe renal 
impairment, and/or moderate or severe hepatic impairment, in the target population in Study 1676 that 
would have an impact on the dosing profile for special populations.

In the descriptive exposure-efficacy analysis, Kaplan-Meier curves of OS by quartile of Ctrough after the 
first dose (Ctrough,1) were performed. An apparent E-R was suggested by MAH with improved OS in the 
higher quartile of exposures. However, this univariate analysis was confounded by the correlation of 
Ctrough,1 with baseline levels of albumin, which itself was correlated with baseline ECOG performance 
status. Given these underlying confounding factors, it is difficult to conclude on the significance of the E-R 
relationship results, especially over such a narrow exposure range, as these confounding factors cannot 
be completely eliminated from the analysis with the available data. 
Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curves of PFS and DOR did not reveal any trends, and the rank order of the quartiles 
was not preserved. Therefore, further analyses with Cox PH modelling were not deemed necessary for 
these endpoints. 
Logistic regression analyses conducted on ORR showed no significant relationship with cemiplimab 
exposure as indicated by the flat E-R for ORR. 
In the exposure-safety relationship analysis, Kaplan-Meier plots for irAEs grade ≥3 and for all irAEs 
suggested a trend where higher exposure quantiles (Cmax) were correlated with higher probabilities of 
experiencing irAEs. However, univariate Cox PH modelling for irAEs grade ≥3 and for all irAEs showedd 
that exposure metrics were not significant predictors of irAE hazard. Therefore, it is unlikely that an E-R 
relationship for all irAEs and irAEs grade ≥3 exists in patients with R/M cervical cancer in Study 1676. 
Similar results were observed for Ctrough and Cav. 
Overall, no E-R relationships for both efficacy and safety endpoints were found in R/M patients with 
cervical cancer in Study 1676 who received cemiplimab 350 mg Q3W IV. These results are consistent with 
the knowledge gained from prior E-R relationship analyses of cemiplimab in patients with advanced CSCC, 
advanced BCC, and advanced NSCLC. 
Consistent with the incidence of ADA observed across all studies, in patients with R/M cervical cancer who 
received cemiplimab 350 mg Q3W IV in Study 1676, the incidence of treatment emergent ADA (1.9%) 
and of persistent ADA (0%) was estimated to be low. 
Since cemiplimab is a human monoclonal antibody and hence cleared from the circulation through 
catabolism, and not subject to protein transporters, no metabolic drug-drug interactions are expected. 
Hence it is acceptable that no formal pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies were submitted. 
No changes to section 5.2 of the SmPC are required since the results from the popPK analysis were 
already updated as part of variation EMEA/H/C/004844/II/31. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The presented clinical pharmacology data for cemiplimab support the approvability of cemiplimab 350 mg 
Q3W IV for the treatment of patients with R/M cervical cancer.

(pemetrexed or topotecan or irinotecan or gemcitabine or vinorelbine) in women with recurrent or 
metastatic cervical cancer after progression to platinum-containing chemotherapy with or without 
bevacizumab. Patients were enrolled regardless of PD-L1 status. Figure 18 provides an overview of the 
key features of Study 1676.

The study included 3 periods:  screening, treatment, and follow-up.  The screening period began with the 
signing of the informed consent form (ICF).  Cycle length was 6 weeks, and tumour imaging (efficacy 
assessment) was at the end of cycles 1 through 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16. Imaging was also performed 
during follow-up visit 1 (30 ±10 days from last dose of cemiplimab or IC of chemotherapy) and follow-up 
visit 2 (90 ±10 days after follow-up visit 1). The investigator decided whether imaging was done by CT or 
MRI, but subsequent assessments should have been made using the same modality. 
Cross-over treatment at progression was not allowed. 
An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) composed of members who were independent from 
the sponsor and the study investigators monitored patient safety by conducting formal reviews of 
accumulated safety data. At prespecified interim analyses only, the IDMC also monitored and reviewed 
the interim primary efficacy analyses for OS in the SCC population. If requested, the IDMC could have 
access to the treatment allocation code or any other requested data for the purposes of a risk-benefit 
assessment. The IDMC acted in an advisory capacity to the sponsor.  
Methods

enrol. 
2.  Tumour progression or recurrence after treatment with platinum therapy (must have been used to 
treat metastatic, persistent, or recurrent cervical cancer). NOTE: Platinum-therapy given in other 
settings (e.g., concurrent with radiation therapy as part of curative-intent therapy, after radiation [or 
chemoradiation] as adjuvant treatment in a patient with no evidence of disease) does not satisfy the 
eligibility requirement regarding prior platinum therapy.

least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension (longest dimension to be 
recorded). Each lesion must be ≥10 mm when measured by computed tomography (CT), magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI), or caliper measurement by clinical exam or must be ≥20 mm when 
measured by chest x-ray. Lymph nodes must be >15 mm in short axis when measured by CT or MRI. 
Tumours within a previously irradiated field will be designated as non-measurable lesions unless 
progression is documented or a biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following 
completion of radiation therapy.

Treatments 
Experimental arm: Cemiplimab at a flat dose of 350 mg Q3W IV, the currently approved dose and 
schedule.  
Control arm: Investigator’s choice (IC) chemotherapy agents were of 4 classes:  
•  Antifolate: pemetrexed (500 mg/m2 IV on day 1, Q3W) 
•  Topoisomerase 1 inhibitor: topotecan (1.0 mg/m2 on days 1 to 5, Q3W) or irinotecan (100 mg/m2 
weekly X 4, followed by 10 to 14 days rest, every 6 weeks [Q6W]) 
•  Nucleoside analogue: gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2 IV on days 1 and 8, Q3W) 
•  Vinca alkaloid: vinorelbine (30 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8, Q3W).   
The study design did not allow cross over between treatment arms.   
Planned treatment for both arms was up to 96 weeks (up to 16 cycles of 6 weeks each), disease 
progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. For patients in the cemiplimab arm, there 
was an option for treatment past progression. Patients who experienced progressive disease on 
cemiplimab were permitted to continue treatment with cemiplimab, as long as they had not presented 
cemiplimab-related safety concerns and their disease was not rapidly progressive. 
According to the protocol, treatment with cemiplimab beyond progression was permitted in patients who 
fulfilled the following conditions: 
•  Stable performance status 
•  The patient does not have rapid progression of disease 
•  The patient has not experienced adverse events that would require permanent discontinuation of 
cemiplimab 
•  The patient provides written informed consent prior to resuming treatment by signing the current 
version of the ICF (eg, the patient repeats the written informed consent that was done prior to initial 
study enrollment). 
•  It is understood that, if there is further progression after resumption of treatment (≥30% increase in 
tumor burden from the time of initial progressive disease by RECIST criteria; this includes an increase 
in the sum of all target lesions and/or the development of new lesions), that cemiplimab will be 
discontinued. 
Objectives 
Primary objective: To compare overall survival (OS) for patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical 
cancer who have histology of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and who have any eligible histology, 
treated with either cemiplimab or investigator’s choice chemotherapy. 
Secondary objectives (performed among SCC patients and among all eligible histologies [(SCC and 
adenocarcinoma/adenosquamous carcinoma]) were : 
• To compare progression-free survival (PFS) of cemiplimab versus IC chemotherapy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/862705/2022 
Page 60/137 
 
 
 
 
 
• To compare objective response rate (ORR) (partial response [PR] + complete response [CR]) of 
cemiplimab versus IC chemotherapy per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) 1.1. 
• To compare the duration of response (DOR) of cemiplimab versus IC chemotherapy. 
• To compare the safety profiles of cemiplimab versus IC chemotherapy by describing adverse events 
(AE). 
• To compare quality of life (QOL) for patients treated with cemiplimab versus IC chemotherapy using the 
European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 
(EORTC QLQ-C30). 
Exploratory Objectives: 
• To measure concentrations of cemiplimab in serum and characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
cemiplimab. 
• To assess the immunogenicity of cemiplimab. 
• To explore associations between the clinical efficacy of cemiplimab and molecular features in 
pretreatment tumour samples. 
• To explore the pharmacodynamic activity of cemiplimab on the immune system in peripheral blood 
samples 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint: OS, defined as the time from randomisation to the date of death. For patients 
who did not have a death date at the time of data cutoff, OS was censored at last known alive date.  
Secondary endpoints: 
•   PFS by investigator: defined as the time from randomisation to the date of the first documented 
tumour progression using RECIST 1.1 per investigator assessment, or death due to any cause. 
Patients who do not have a documented tumour progression or death will be censored on the date of 
their last evaluable tumour assessment. Patients who do not have any evaluable tumour assessments 
after randomization and do not die were to be censored on the date of randomization. 
•   ORR by investigator: defined as the number of patients with a best overall response (BOR) of 
confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) using RECIST 1.1 per investigator 
assessment divided by the number of patients in the efficacy analysis set.  Best overall response was 
defined as the BOR between the date of randomization and the date of the first objectively 
documented progression or the date of subsequent anti-cancer therapy, whichever came first.  
Other endpoints included duration of response (DOR) and patient reported outcomes (PRO).  Duration of 
response was defined as the time between the date of first response (CR or PR) to the date of the first 
documented tumour progression (per RECIST 1.1) or death due to any cause.  
Patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical carcinoma were given the opportunity to report on their 
symptoms, functioning and overall QoL in Study 1676 using the European Organization for Research and 
Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) PRO instrument, version 3.  
Patient safety was to be assessed through the collection of reported adverse events (AEs), clinical 
laboratory data, vital signs, ECG and physical exam. Unless otherwise noted, the baseline value was 
defined as the last available value before the first dose of study treatment.

Sample size 
The primary endpoint was overall survival among patients treated with cemiplimab versus IC of 
chemotherapy. The median OS has been reported in range of 6.5 months to 8.1 months in the phase 2 
setting. The sponsor assumed a median OS of 7 months for SCC patients treated with IC chemotherapy 
and a median OS of 10 months for SCC patients treated with cemiplimab. The assumptions corresponded 
to an approximately 42.8% increase in median OS and a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.7 if OS is distributed 
exponentially in both treatment groups.  
Two interim efficacy analyses were planned using Lan-DeMets (O’Brien-Fleming) spending function at 
70% and 85% of the total OS events, respectively. A total of 340 OS events in SCC patients was to yield 
approximately 90% power to detect an HR of 0.7 with an overall type I error of 0.025 (1-sided).   
Considering the enrollment rate (2 patients/month for months 1 to 5, 9 patients/month for months 6 to 
16, 20 patients/month for months 17 to 23, and 22 patients/month for month 24 and beyond) and 10% 
dropout rate per year, enrollment of 460 randomized SCC patients was to yield 340 OS events for 
analysis of OS around 42 months after the first SCC patient is randomized. 
At the time when 460 SCC patients were enrolled in the study, a total enrollment in the study of 
approximately 590 patients was projected (SCC plus non-SCC). The actual number of patients to be 
enrolled was to depend on the proportion of adenocarcinoma patients in the patient population and the 
time when Amendment 5 was implemented at each of the study sites. If the HR was 0.7, the power for 
testing OS in the overall population was to be higher than 90%. 
Randomisation 
Randomization was stratified according to: 
1. Histology (squamous cell carcinoma vs. adenocarcinoma). Adenosquamous histology was considered 
adenocarcinoma for the purpose of stratification. 
2. Geographic Region: North America (Canada, USA) vs. Asia (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan) vs. Rest of 
World (ROW) (Australia, Brazil, Poland, Russia, Spain, Belgium, Italy, Greece, UK) 
3. Prior bevacizumab (yes/no) 
4. ECOG performance status (0,1) 
The stratification factors of “prior bevacizumab use” and “ECOG performance status” were used for 
balancing treatment assignment only and were not included in the statistical model for analysis of the 
primary endpoint.

Statistical methods 
Efficacy analysis population 
The full analysis set (FAS) included all randomized patients. This was the intention to treat population. 
The FAS was based on the treatment allocated (as randomized). All efficacy endpoints were analysed 
using the FAS. 
Primary efficacy endpoint OS 
The primary endpoint of OS was to be analysed in SCC patients by stratified log-rank test using 
geographic region (North America versus Asia-Pacific versus ROW) as a stratification factor. The HR and 
its 95% CI were to be estimated by a stratified Cox regression model with Efron’s method for tie handling 
and using the treatment as covariate. The distribution of OS was to be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier 
method.  
If the analysis of OS was statistically significant in the SCC patients, then the analysis of OS was to be 
performed in the overall population by stratified log-rank test using the following stratification factors 
(histology and geographic region). The HR and its 95% CI were to be estimated by a stratified Cox 
regression model with Efron’s method for tie handling and using the treatment as covariate. The Kaplan-
Meier estimate of median OS with its 95% CI and the estimates with the 95% CIs at specific time points 
were to be summarized by treatment group. 
Censoring rules for OS 
A patient who has not died was to be censored at the last known alive date. 
Sensitivity analyses were to be performed for OS 
• 
• 
• 
The first sensitivity analysis was to be performed using the stratification information (i.e., 
histology) collected in the clinical database. 
The second sensitivity analysis was to be performed using the Rank Preserving Structural Failure 
Time (RPSFT) model to account for the effect of the PD-1/PD-L1 treatments after disease 
progression in the chemotherapy arm 
The third sensitivity analysis was to be performed to account for the effect of the posttreatment 
immune check-point inhibitors (including PD1/PDL1, and others) in both arms after primary study 
period. Patients who received post-treatment immune checkpoint inhibitors were to be censored 
on the start date of post-treatment immune checkpoint inhibitors. 
Key secondary efficacy endpoints PFS and ORR 
PFS 
The analysis of PFS was to be analysed using the same statistical method as described for the primary 
analysis of OS with regard to SCC and overall population. 
Censoring rules for PFS 
Patients who do not have a documented tumour progression or death were to be censored on the date of 
their last evaluable tumour assessment. Patients who do not have any evaluable tumour assessments 
after randomization and do not die were to be censored on the date of randomization. 
Assessment report  
EMA/862705/2022 
Page 63/137 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sensitivity analyses will be performed for PFS 
The first sensitivity analysis was the same as the main analysis except that it considered initiation of new 
anti-cancer therapy as a progressive disease event for patients without documented radiological PD or 
death on or prior to initiation of new anticancer treatment. 
The second sensitivity analysis was the same as the main analysis except that it considered clinical 
progression as a progressive disease event for patients without documented radiological PD or death on 
or prior to clinical progression. 
ORR 
The ORR was to be analysed using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by the same stratification 
factors used in analysis of OS with regard to the SCC and overall population. ORR and the corresponding 
95% exact CI will be calculated by Clopper-Pearson method for each treatment arm. 
Patients with the best overall response of NE will be considered as non-responder. 
One sensitivity analysis will be performed using the same method as above in ORR eligible patients, 
defined as all randomized patients who had baseline and at least one valid post-baseline tumor 
evaluation. 
Multiplicity considerations  
The multiplicity was controlled at one-sided 0.025 level by group sequential design for interim and final 
analyses for OS in SCC patients and a hierarchical testing procedure for OS, PFS, QoL and ORR in SCC 
and overall population. 
Type I error control for interim and final analyses of OS in SCC patients using group sequential design 
Two interim efficacy analyses were planned for the primary endpoint of OS in SCC patients using Lan-
DeMets (O’Brien-Fleming) spending function at 70% and 85% of the total OS, respectively. 
The first interim efficacy analysis was to be performed after observing approximately 238 OS events in 
SCC patients (70% of total OS events). The second interim efficacy analysis was to be performed after 
observing approximately 289 OS events in SCC patients (85% of total OS events). The final efficacy 
analysis was to be performed after observing approximately 340 OS events in SCC patients. The actual 
alpha spending was to be based on the actual number of OS events included in the analyses and 
determined.

Of the patients screened, 608 were randomized, 304 patients to the cemiplimab arm and 304 patients to 
the investigator’s choice of chemotherapy arm. Table 28 shows patient disposition for the intention-to-
treat (ITT) population of the pivotal trial. 
As of the data cut-off for the CSR (04 January 2021), the median follow-up duration (from randomisation 
to data cutoff date) for the total population was 18.18 months (range: 6.0 to 38.2 months).

Subgroup analyses – Efficacy by PD-L1 status: 
Patients were recruited regardless of PD-L1 status. Exploratory analysis of tumour cell PD-L1 expression 
in available archival tumour samples was performed using the analytically validated 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay. The PD-L1 assay was performed by a third-party vendor (Roche, 
Ventana) using the SP263 antibody clone. Based on the assay vendor instructions for use, to preserve 
antigenicity, slides should have been stained within 6 months from the date that sections were mounted 
on slides. Slides that were >6 months old were considered to be outside the optimal testing window.

Data cut-off as of Jan 4th, 2021 
The purpose of prespecifying a rank preserving structural failure time (RPSFT) sensitivity analysis on OS 
was to remove the crossover treatment benefit in the chemotherapy arm in the case that many patients 
in the chemotherapy arm crossed over to PD-1/PD-L1 treatment outside of this study. Given only 15.1% 
patients in the chemotherapy arm received post-progression PD-L1 treatment outside of the study, this 
analysis was not performed after database lock. Nevertheless, the MAH provided the results of this 
analysis upon request.

Supportive study – Study 1423 
Study 1423 was the first-in-human (FIH) study of cemiplimab.  Planned treatment duration was 
48 weeks, followed by a post-treatment follow-up period of approximately 5.5 months. The protocol 
contained a dose escalation portion and 25 expansion cohorts. The three cervical cancer patients in the 
dose escalation portion were not discussed as they received different doses of cemiplimab to the dose 
used in the expansion phase. Expansion cohorts 23 and 24 (EXP23 and EXP24) were designed to obtain 
additional clinical experience with cemiplimab in patients with relapsed/metastatic cervical cancer. Ten 
patients were enrolled in EXP23 and received 3 mg/kg cemiplimab IV every 2 weeks (Q2W) and 
10 patients enrolled in EXP24 and received 3 mg/kg cemiplimab IV Q2W + radiation therapy (RT).   
Disposition, Demographics, and Baseline Characteristics 
In EXP23, 9 out of 10 patients discontinued treatment prior to the analysis cut-off date with the main 
reason being disease progression/recurrence. The median age of the patients in EXP23 was 51.5 years 
(range: 31 to 76 years), 90% were white, all patients had an ECOG performance status of 0 (40.0%) or 
1 (60.0%), and all patients had received prior cancer-related systemic therapy.  
In EXP24, all 10 patients discontinued treatment prior to (or by) analysis cut-off date with the main 
reason being disease progression/recurrence. The median age of the patients in EXP24 was 48.6 years 
(range: 29 to 65 years), 8 patients were white, 1 black or African American and 1 Asian. All patients had 
an ECOG performance status of 0 (20.0%) or 1 (80.0%), and all patients had received prior cancer-
related systemic therapy and 8 out of 10 had prior cancer-related radiotherapy.  
Efficacy Results 
The data cut-off date for this efficacy analysis was 30 April 2019.  All efficacy results were per 
investigator assessment. Patients were not tested for PD-L1 status prior to being randomized on the 
study.  
The ORR for patients in EXP23 was 10.0% (1/10) and in EXP24 was 10.0% (1/10), partial responses in 
both cases. 
The observed estimated DOR was 11.2 months for the responder in EXP23 and 6.4 months for the 
responder in EXP24. 
The KM estimation of median PFS by investigator assessment was 1.9 months (95% CI [1.0, 9.0]) for 
EXP23 and 3.6 months (95% CI [0.6, 5.7]) for EXP24.  
The KM estimation of median OS for EXP23 was 10.3 (2.1, NE) months; median OS for EXP24 was 8.0 
(1.7, NE).  
Combining the dose escalation portion of the study, in which objective responses were observed in 2 of 3

cervical cancer patients per investigator assessment with cervical cancer EXP23 and EXP24, there were 4 
responses among 23 cervical cancer patients. All 4 responses were in patients with squamous tumor 
histology.  
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The MAH for cemiplimab, an anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, seeks an extension of indication to 
treat adult patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer with disease progression on or after 
chemotherapy. The application is based on results from Study 1676, an open-label, randomised 1:1, 
phase III trial that compared cemiplimab monotherapy vs. investigator’s choice of chemotherapy 
(pemetrexed or topotecan or irinotecan or gemcitabine or vinorelbine) in women with recurrent or 
metastatic cervical cancer after progression to platinum-based chemotherapy with or without 
bevacizumab.  
In study 1676, 608 patients were randomised between November 2017 and July 2020. Subjects were 
recruited regardless of PD-L1 expression status, but only squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) or 
adenocarcinoma/adenosquamous carcinoma (AC) histologies were allowed. The primary endpoint was 
overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints were PFS, ORR, DOR and QoL.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The design of this pivotal trial was discussed with the CHMP via a scientific advice (SA) procedure in April 
2017. Given the diverse treatment options in the control arm, the open-label nature of the trial was 
considered acceptable, as were the primary and secondary endpoints, frequency of response 
assessments, stratification factors and statistical analysis plan (SAP). ECOG PS was added as a 
stratification factor as of Amendment 2, but it was not to be included in the primary analysis model for 
efficacy. A cap on enrollment of AC histology was added as of Amendment 5 and sample size was 
changed accordingly.  
Study participants: Inclusion/exclusion criteria appropriately reflect the population intended for treatment 
with cemiplimab.  
As of Amendment 4 of the protocol (16-AUG-2018), the term “platinum-refractory”, defined as 
progressive disease within 6 months of last dose of platinum therapy, was removed from the protocol. 
Subsequently, the eligibility requirement regarding prior platinum therapy (inclusion criterion #2) stated 
that tumour progression or recurrence should have occurred after treatment with cisplatin or carboplatin. 
Nevertheless, the applicant clarified that 55% (331 out of 608) of patients recruited in Study 1676 
discontinued platinum-based chemotherapy due to progression while on treatment, which justifies the 
proposed indication. No other important amendments to inclusion/exclusion criteria that would alter the 
B/R of cemiplimab in the intended indication were done along conduct of the pivotal study.  Treatments: 
All five choices of chemotherapy in the control arm are deemed acceptable. The regimen of cemiplimab in 
the experimental arm corresponds to the currently authorised dose and schedule and is considered 
acceptable (see discussion on clinical pharmacology). The fact that crossover was not allowed to avoid 
confounding survival is reasonable, noting that a sensitivity analysis of OS that censored patients who 
had received post-treatment immune checkpoint inhibitors was consistent with the primary analysis. 
Endpoints: The objectives and endpoints of Study 1676 are deemed adequate for the targeted setting. 
Despite the open-label nature of the trial, considering the unmet medical need of the intended population 
(≥2L, low response rates from other products) and the fact that the primary endpoint is OS, response 
assessment by investigator is considered reasonable. The fact that PROs were collected is acknowledged, 
but since their clinical relevance in an open-label trial remains questionable, inclusion of their results in 
section 5.1 of the SmPC is not endorsed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/862705/2022 
Page 99/137 
 
 
 
 
Statistical methods: Sample size calculations are endorsed. The stratification factors (histology, 
geographic region, prior bevacizumab and ECOG PS) are clinically relevant and thus acceptable. Since 
prior bevacizumab and ECOG PS were not included in the statistical tests of OS and PFS, sensitivity 
analyses were provided (data not shown), along with the planned RPSFT analysis for OS. In both cases, 
results were concordant with those from the primary analysis. The statistical approach to control type I 
error due to multiple looks (2 IAs + final analysis) and testing of diverse hypotheses is endorsed. The 
SCC subpopulation (n=477) was prioritised over the ITT (N=608) across testing of all efficacy endpoints 
(OS, PFS, ORR). The requested indication does not specify histology, but this is acceptable when 
considering favourable results across both ITT and SCC. Changes to the SAP followed major amendments 
of the protocol which is acceptable.  
Regarding the recruitment of patients with adenocarcinoma (AC) histology, capped as of Amendment 5 
(08-MAR-2019), the MAH clarified that these patients have longer follow-up than those with SCC. There 
were no major changes in standard of care for AC patients after March 2019 and therefore patients with 
AC recruited before March 2019 are expected to be representative of those recruited afterwards. 
Participant flow and recruitment: A total of 752 patients were screened for eligibility. Most of screen 
failures (87% out of 144) were due to not meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria. The screen failure rate 
(19%) is acceptable. 304 patients were randomised to cemiplimab and 304 to chemotherapy. 3% of 
patients from the ITT were randomised but never treated. It is not expected that this low proportion will 
impact the interpretation of efficacy endpoints. The unbalance among arms (13 in the chemotherapy arm 
vs 5 in cemiplimab) is understandable due to the open-label nature of the trial. From the patients 
randomised to chemotherapy, the preferred agents in decreasing order were: gemcitabine (40%), 
pemetrexed (37%), vinorelbine (10%), topotecan (7%) and irinotecan (6%). Median follow-up since 
randomisation (~18 months) was balanced between arms. At data cutoff date (4-JAN-2021), 78% of 
patients had been followed up for ≥12 months since randomisation. 
Conduct of the study: Major protocol violations were scant and treatment-related: lack or reconsenting 
for continuing treatment beyond PD in the cemiplimab arm or SAEs reported ≥24h were the most 
frequent causes. Regarding major protocol amendments, the rationale to cap enrolment of patients with 
AC is not entirely followed. However, the overall proportions of SCC and AC in Study 1676 were 
consistent with global distribution of cervical cancer histologies and no significant differences in efficacy 
according to histology were seen. Two interim analyses were introduced late (06-MAY-2020) compared to 
the start of the study (05-SEP-2017) and close to the database lock (18-FEB-2021), apparently to 
provide an opportunity for an early efficacy analysis, but they were performed by an independent 
statistician prior to review by the IDMC. 
Baseline data: Median age was 51 years (22 to 87 years); 63% were white, 29% asian, 3.5% black; 92% 
had received previous paclitaxel, while 49% had received prior bevacizumab; 47% had ECOG PS 0; 78% 
had SCC histology and 22% AC. Regarding the extent of disease at randomisation, 94% of patients had 
metastatic disease, while the remaining 6% had recurrent or persistent disease. The overall burden and 
distribution of disease according to RECIST 1.1 data is balanced between both arms of the trial. 43% had 
>1 prior line of treatment in the recurrent or metastatic setting.  
Patients from both arms seem to be balanced according to the period after prior platinum (≤6 months vs. 
>6 months) and specific platinum compound (i.e., carboplatin, cisplatin). About 88% of patients had a 
platinum-free interval (PFI) ≤6 months. Tables that detail the platinum-free interval (PFI) by longest and 
shortest duration (some of them were re-treated with platinum) showed a balanced distribution between 
both arms of Study 1676. An ad hoc analysis of efficacy in terms of OS/PFS/ORR/DOR according to PFI 
(not presented in this report) suggest that the benefit of cemiplimab over chemotherapy seems to be 
maintained regardless of the time interval to progression after prior platinum therapy, even in the ≥12 
months subgroup (for which retreatment with platinum could potentially be a choice). 
Assessment report  
EMA/862705/2022 
Page 100/137 
 
 
 
 
Discordances between stratification factors according to IWRS and clinical database were scarce (data not 
shown) and thus not expected to impact interpretation of efficacy results. 
Overall, the baseline demographic and disease characteristics were consistent with inclusion/exclusion 
criteria and reflect the targeted population for treatment with cemiplimab. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
OS: At data cutoff 04-JAN-2021 and with a median follow-up of 18.2 months, 395 deaths had occurred 
(65% of OS maturity) in the ITT population of Study 1676. The study met its primary endpoint, since the 
HR for OS showed superiority of cemiplimab over investigator’s choice of chemotherapy in both SCC 
population [HR for OS 0.73 (95% CI 0.58, 0.91), p-value 0.00306] and ITT [HR for OS 0.68 (95% CI 
0.56, 0.84), p-value 0.00011], as prespecified in hierarchical testing. The AC histology population 
representing 22% of the ITT population also exhibited a survival benefit, with an exploratory HR of 0.56 
(95% CI 0.36, 0.85). For the ITT, K-M estimates of median OS were 12.0 months in the cemiplimab arm 
and 8.5 months in the chemotherapy arm. A median survival improvement of 4.5 months is considered a 
clinically relevant achievement of cemiplimab in the targeted advanced cervical cancer population. 
In an updated exploratory OS analysis (data cut-off 04-JAN-2022) with median follow-up of 30.2 months 
and 76% of event maturity, the survival benefit from cemiplimab over chemotherapy was maintained 
(HR: 0.66, 95% CI 0.55, 0.79). 
INV-assessed PFS: At considerable event maturity (86%) in the ITT, PFS was also statistically improved 
in the cemiplimab vs. the chemotherapy arm: HR 0.745 (95% CI 0.625, 0.89), p-value 0.00048. K-M 
estimates of PFS were almost equivalent in both arms (2.8 months in cemiplimab, 2.9 months in 
chemotherapy) as curves separated after the third month. This pattern of “delayed” PFS benefit (i.e. less 
pronounced PFS improvement than OS improvement) has been seen with other immune checkpoint 
inhibitors, particularly for tumour types that exhibit high aggressiveness, e.g. extensive-stage small cell 
lung cancer (IMpower133, Horn et al, NEJM 2018; CASPIAN, Paz-Ares et al, Lancet 2019). Considering 
one third of patients from the cemiplimab arm and almost half from the chemotherapy arm received post-
trial treatment anticancer systemic therapy, a PFS2 analysis would have been of value. However, time-to-
event data for a PFS2 analysis are not available according to the MAH. Cytotoxic agents constituted the 
majority of post-trial treatments in both arms, although, expectably, a higher proportion of monoclonal 
antibodies (almost all immune checkpoint inhibitors) was used in the chemotherapy arm (60 patients, 
20%) as compared to the cemiplimab arm (17 patients, 6%).  
INV-assessed ORR/DOR: Acknowledging the advanced post-platinum setting, low response rates were 
observed in both arms: 16.4% in the cemiplimab arm vs. 6.3% in the chemotherapy arm, although a 
statistically significant CMH test was observed. Likewise, the few responses were more durable in the 
cemiplimab arm (mDOR 16.4 months, vs. 6.9 in the chemotherapy arm). 
Ancillary analyses: OS and PFS advantage from cemiplimab over chemotherapy was observed across 
almost all the prespecified subgroups. Although the HR for OS in the recurrent/persistent subgroup 
exceeded 1, this subpopulation consisted of only 34 patients with 17 events.  
Efficacy by PD-L1 status: An exploratory analysis on the relationship between PD-L1 expression according 
to the SP263 IHC assay and efficacy in terms of OS, PFS and ORR was done for a subgroup of the 
population of Study 1676. Evaluable samples were available for 254 patients (42%) from the ITT and 
balanced between arms.  
Among these samples, 64% were PD-L1≥1% and 36% were PD-L1<1%. At the updated exploratory OS 
analysis on 04-JAN-2022, the hazard ratio for the PD-L1≥ 1% group was 0.70 (95% CI: 0.48, 1.01) and 
0.85 (95% CI: 0.53, 1.36) for the PD-L1<1% group. Upon these data, it appears that the efficacy 
estimate is also compatible with benefit in the underpowered PD-L1<1% subgroup; moreover, given what 
Assessment report  
EMA/862705/2022 
Page 101/137 
 
 
 
 
is known about PD-1 inhibitors, a detrimental effect of cemiplimab in the present treatment setting is not 
considered likely. 
The evaluation of efficacy in subgroups is generally fraught with difficulty given that these will generally 
not be large enough for independent efficacy inferences. In an overall positive study, it is considered 
acceptable to use the most mature –and therefore statistically powerful– dataset to evaluate the impact 
of treatment in subgroups. While the pivotal study was overall positive, the magnitude of efficacy in 
subgroups indicate that also in this treatment setting PD-L1 expression is a relevant effect modifier.  
Recognising that efficacy will increase with increasing PD-L1 expression, this is understood as a 
continuum, and it seems reasonable not to restrict use based on PD-L1 expression levels. OS by PD-L1 
status, however, will be presented in section 5.1 of the SmPC, as an integral part of the description of the 
performance characteristics of cemiplimab in the intended treatment setting. 
Treatment with cemiplimab beyond progression: Efficacy data presented for the subgroup of 70 patients 
(23% of the cemiplimab arm) who continued cemiplimab beyond progression as allowed per protocol 
suggest that they continued to derive an efficacy benefit. However, considering the fact that these 
patients are highly selected, these data will not be presented in the SmPC.  
Supportive data from Study 1423: 20 patients from two advanced cervical cancer cohorts were treated in 
this FIH trial. Although data were clearly limited, efficacy signals (10% ORR) served to support the design 
of Study 1676. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Study 1676 showed an advantage of cemiplimab vs. investigator’s choice of chemotherapy choices in the 
treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer with disease progression after 
platinum-based chemotherapy. While the pivotal study was overall positive, the magnitude of efficacy in 
subgroups indicate that PD-L1 expression is a relevant effect modifier, although a restricted indication is 
not deemed necessary.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The safety profile of cemiplimab has been characterised in patients with advanced solid malignancies who 
received cemiplimab monotherapy in 4 clinical studies. The toxicity profile of cemiplimab is characterised 
by immune-related mediated adverse reactions including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism pneumonitis, 
hepatitis, colitis and skin adverse reactions. Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in association 
with cemiplimab treatment. 
The summary of clinical safety (SCS) submitted by the MAH presented safety data from 5 studies: Study 
1676 (confirmatory study for the cervical cancer indication), and studies 1423, 1540, 1620 and 1624, in 
patients who received at least 1 dose of cemiplimab as monotherapy. The following table summarises the 
studies included in the safety data pools.

Data from two safety data pools were presented as described below: 
•  Safety Pool 1 (Cervical Cancer population): All patients who received at least 1 dose of 
cemiplimab monotherapy in Study 1676. This pool included 300 patients. This is the primary pool 
for the analysis of safety of cemiplimab in patients with recurrent/metastatic cervical cancer.  
•  Safety Pool 2 (cemiplimab monotherapy population): All patients (n=1116) who received at 
least 1 dose of cemiplimab as monotherapy across Study 1676 (n=300), Study 1423 (n=130), 
Study 1540 (Groups 1, 2, and 3, n=193), Study 1620 (n=138) and Study 1624 (excluding 
crossover cemiplimab treatment, n=355). This pool is used to evaluate the frequency and 
characteristics of important risks of cemiplimab (imAEs and IRRs) and allows a broader 
assessment of the safety profile of cemiplimab monotherapy across dose levels and solid tumor 
indications. 
Table 2 summarises the studies contained in each safety pool and the data cutoff dates.

The most frequent reasons for discontinuations in the cemiplimab arm were primarily immune-mediated 
events: hepatobiliary disorders in 8 (2.7%) patients (autoimmune/immune-mediate/other hepatitis, 
abnormal hepatic function) and respiratory disorders in 5 (1.7%) (pneumonitis). 
Less frequent reasons for discontinuing cemiplimab were: infections 4 (1.3%) patients (pneumonias, 
various abdominal infections), gastrointestinal disorders 3 (1%) patients (colitis, gastritis, pancreatitis), 
blood and lymphatic disorders 2 (0.7%) patients (anaemia, febrile neutropenia) and endocrine disorders 
2 (0.7%) patients (hypothyroidism). 
In the chemotherapy arm, the reasons for discontinuations were more varied, the most frequent being: 
gastrointestinal disorders 2 (0.7%) patients, blood and lymphatic disorders 2 (0.7%) patients, general 
disorders (fatigue, malaise) 2 (0.7%) patients, infusion-related reactions 2 (0.7%) patients and nervous 
system disorders 3 (1%) patients. 
2.5.9.  Post marketing experience 
Cemiplimab is approved in several countries for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic or locally 
advanced CSCC who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation. Cemiplimab is also 
approved in some countries for BCC and first line treatment of NSCLC with high PD-L1 expression. 
Cumulatively up to 27 March 2021, a total of 3945 patients (3349 patients from Regeneron studies and 
596 patients from non-Regeneron sponsored studies) have been treated with investigational cemiplimab 
monotherapy, combination therapy, or comparator product in multiple clinical trials. The cumulative 
exposure to cemiplimab in clinical studies is estimated to be 97,072 patient weeks (82,266 patient-weeks 
in Regeneron studies and 14,806 patient-weeks in non-Regeneron studies).  
Based on the sales figures through 31 March 2021, the global cumulative exposure to cemiplimab was 
estimated to be 6484 patient-years.  
The list of important identified risks for cemiplimab discussed in the Periodic Safety Update Report are 
Immune-related adverse reactions and Infusion-related reactions. The important potential risks for 
cemiplimab are lack of effect due to anti-drug antibodies and embryo-fetal toxicity (not a risk in the EU 
risk management plan). The missing information for cemiplimab are long-term safety data (risk 
management plan safety concern), use in pregnant women and use in breast-feeding women. 
Since initial approval in the US in September 2018, no new safety concerns/important risks were 
identified from post marketing data. 
2.5.10.  Discussion on clinical safety 
For the safety assessment, the MAH has provided data from the safety dataset (n=300 in the cemiplimab 
arm and n=290 in the chemotherapy arm) at the second interim analysis (~65% of OS events observed) 
of the ongoing study 1676 in patients with cervical cancer with progression after prior platinum 
treatment. The safety data cutoff (DCO) for this submission was 04 January 2021. 
Also, pooled safety data from 5 studies was submitted: 1676 (current study), 1423, 1540, 1620 and 1624 
in patients who received at least 1 dose of cemiplimab as monotherapy, the majority of whom received 
the currently authorised dose of 350 mg Q3W. Data from the cemiplimab arm of study 1676 represented 
safety pool 1 (n=300) and data from the 5 monotherapy studies comprised the safety pool 2 (n=1116). 
The size of safety data pools is considered sufficient for a meaningful safety assessment.  
Assessment report  
EMA/862705/2022 
Page 125/137 
 
 
 
 
 
Exposure: By the DCO, 87.7% patients in the cemiplimab arm and 97.6% in the chemotherapy arm were 
off treatment and 82.3% and 96.2% respectively were off study. In both arms most patients discontinued 
treatment primarily due to disease progression, only 4.3% in the cemiplimab arm completed the 
maximum allowed treatment (96 weeks). The main reasons for being off study in both arms were either 
death, 29.7% and 32.4%, or disease progression, 32.7% and 40.3%. The extent of on-treatment and on-
study is considered sufficient for a meaningful safety assessment. The median and mean duration of 
treatment exposure were higher in the cemiplimab arm (15 and 26.5 (26) weeks) compared to the 
chemotherapy arm (10 and 14.4 (13) weeks) in study 1676. In the cemiplimab arm vs the chemotherapy 
arm, 61.7% vs 43.1% were on treatment ≥12 weeks, 37% vs 16.9% more than 24 weeks and 19.3% vs 
3.4% more than 48 weeks. Patients were on treatment longer in the cemiplimab arm compared to the 
chemotherapy arm, which suggests better tolerability of cemiplimab.  
Exposure for patients with known PD-L1 status (updated n=371 biomarker dataset) across both arms 
appeared slightly longer for those with PD-L1≥1% in both arms. 
AEs: Most patients experienced an AE of any grade in the pivotal trial, 88.3% in the cemiplimab arm and 
91.4% in the chemotherapy arm, and 45% vs 53.4% experienced AEs of grade ≥3. In both categories, 
frequencies were higher in the chemotherapy arm.  
SAEs and AEs resulting in death were observed in 29.7% vs 26.9% and 1.7% vs 0.7% in the cemiplimab 
vs the chemotherapy arm respectively. Discontinuation due to AEs was observed in 8.7% vs 5.2%. In 
these 3 categories, the observed frequencies were higher in the cemiplimab arm, and were comparable to 
those observed in the cemiplimab monotherapy pool.  
High-grade AEs: With regards to AEs ≥grade 3, the five most frequent in the cemiplimab arm were: 
anaemia 12%, urinary tract infection 5%, hypokalaemia 2.7%, asthenia 2.3% and hydronephrosis 2.3%.  
In the chemotherapy arm the five most frequent were: anaemia 26.9%, neutropenia 9%, 
thrombocytopenia 3.1%, urinary tract infection 2.8% and vomiting 2.4%.  
The observed frequencies and categories of high-grade (≥G3) AEs were as expected. The overall 
incidence of high-grade events between the cemiplimab arm of Study 1676 and the cemiplimab 
monotherapy pool were overall comparable. 
SAEs occurred in 29.7% of patients from the cemiplimab arm and in 26.9% of the chemotherapy arm. 
The most frequent SAE in both arms was infections: 10.7% vs, 11.4%, respectively. The most frequent 
infections were urinary tract infections (4% vs 3.4%), pneumonia (1.3% vs 1%) and pyelonephritis (1% 
in both arms). Gastrointestinal disorders (4.3% vs 4.8%) were equally frequent. Autoimmune/immune-
mediated hepatitis, a known imAE with incidence of 2.6%, only occurred in the cemiplimab arm. 
Pneumonitis was also more frequent in the cemiplimab arm (1% vs 0.3%) whereas haematologic SAEs 
(1.7% vs 6.9%) occurred with a higher frequency in the chemotherapy arm, with febrile neutropenia (1% 
vs 1.7%), anaemia (0.7% vs 4.8%) and thrombocytopenia (0% vs 1%) being the most frequent. The 
pattern in the distribution, frequency and type of the SAEs in the two arms was reflective of 
immunotherapy and chemotherapy, respectively, and were as expected.  
AEs resulting in death: In study 1676, from the narratives of the patients with AEs resulting in death in 
the cemiplimab arm it is agreed that in 4 out of 5 patients, the deaths do not seem to be treatment 
related. In the case of a 39-year-old patient that died from pneumonia, not enough data could be 
obtained to rule out the possibility of immune-related pneumonitis. In the chemotherapy arm, 2 patients 
experienced TEAEs resulting in death, both incidences considered as treatment-related by the 
investigator.  
AESIs: In the study protocol, 4 types of events were defined as AESIs whereof data only on 2 of these 4 
have been presented in the dossier (CSR): infusion related reactions (IRR) and imAEs. The data 
presented was sponsor-identified and not investigator-identified.  
Assessment report  
EMA/862705/2022 
Page 126/137 
 
 
 
 
IRRs: As expected, the incidence of IRRs was higher in the chemotherapy arm (4.5%) compared to the 
cemiplimab arm (2.7%). 0 vs 1 (0.3%) in the cemiplimab arm and chemotherapy arm respectively were 
grade ≥3, no patient in either arm experienced serious IRRs, 0 vs 2 (0.7%) patients discontinued 
treatment due to IRRs and 5 (1.7%) vs 9 (3.1%) had dose interruptions/delay due to IRRs. The 
frequencies of IRRs were similar between safety pool 1 and 2, 2.7 % vs 3% respectively. The symptoms 
were mostly gastro-intestinal (nausea 2% vs 1.3%, vomiting 1.3% vs 0.7%, abdominal pain 0.3% vs 
0.4%) and pyrexia (1% vs 1.1%) and were as expected similar between the 2 pools. 
imAEs: As expected, the incidence of imAEs was higher in the cemiplimab arm (15.7%) than in the 
chemotherapy arm (0.7%). About a third of imAEs were high-grade and/or serious, and the same 
proportion discontinued cemiplimab because of imAEs. Slightly fewer patients (15.7%) in pool 1 had any 
imAE compared to pool 2 (20.5%). Any grade ≥3 imAEs (5.3% vs 6.4%), serious imAEs (5% vs 5.5%) or 
discontinuations due to imAEs (5% vs 4.6%) were comparable between pool 1 and 2. The most frequent 
imAEs in the cemiplimab arm were endocrine disorders 8%, hepatobiliary disorders 3.3% and skin and 
subcutaneous disorders 1.7%, same as in pool 2. No new or unexpected frequencies of known IRRs or 
imAEs were registered in study 1676. 
ADRs:  
The ADRs nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain together with urinary tract infections occurred with a 
higher frequency in the cemiplimab arm of study 1676 compared to the chemotherapy arm and to pool 2. 
This could be explained by the pattern of dissemination and location of cervical cancer.  
General disorders (fatigue, pyrexia and asthenia), infections (except for urinary tract infections that 
occurred with a higher frequency), metabolic and nutrition disorders (decreased appetite) and 
musculoskeletal disorders (musculoskeletal pain) all occurred with similar frequencies in the 2 pools.  
Respiratory and skin disorders occurred with lower frequencies in pool 1 compared to pool 2. 
Patients with cervical cancer exhibited higher rates of ADR anaemia across both cemiplimab and 
chemotherapy arms, noting nearly double risk of any-grade and ≥G3 anaemia from chemotherapy. Of 
note, anaemia was part of the medical history of 37% of patients from the cemiplimab arm and 36% of 
the chemotherapy arm. All ADRs are appropriately listed in Table 2 from section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
The incidences of ADRs have already been updated in the SmPC section 4.8 based on a larger safety 
dataset (N=1198) as part of the recently approved renewal application (see EMEA/H/C/004844/R/0029). 
Hence no further update of section 4.8 of the SmPC is warranted. 
Laboratory findings: The laboratory findings in study 1676 were as expected and in line with the higher 
rate of haematological toxicity in the chemotherapy arm and hepatotoxicity in the cemiplimab arm. 
Incidence of AEs according to age subgroups: As expected, the largest differences were in general 
observed between the group of <65 years and ≥85 years, but not considered to require a specific 
warning. 
AEs according to PD-L1 expression subgroups: Particularly concerning the cemiplimab arm, there does 
not seem to be a specific pattern of toxicity that would indicate higher rates of all-grade, high-grade, G5 
AEs, imAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation in the PD-L1<1% vs. PD-L1≥1% subpopulations. Of note, 
although SAEs occurred in 39% vs. 28% of patients (PD-L1<1% and PD-L1≥1% subgroups, respectively), 
it cannot be concluded that this difference would be attributable to PD-L1% expression per se taking into 
account that absolute numbers of patients in these subgroups were low.  
Discontinuation due to AEs: The discontinuation rate of 8.7% in the cemiplimab arm was higher than in 
the chemotherapy arm (5.2%) and was also slightly higher than what was seen with cemiplimab for 1L 
advanced NSCLC (6.5%, study 1624), noting that in the current study the treatment was given in second 
Assessment report  
EMA/862705/2022 
Page 127/137 
 
 
 
 
or ulterior lines in a heavily pretreated population. Also, compared to other PD-1 inhibitors, the current 
discontinuation rate is at the same/low end level. 
2.5.11.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
In conclusion, chemotherapy exhibited a more toxic profile regarding AEs and grade ≥3 AEs compared to 
the PD-1 inhibitor cemiplimab in Study 1676. The opposite pattern was seen with regards to SAEs, 
treatment discontinuation and AEs associated with death, in which, treatment with cemiplimab resulted in 
higher frequencies compared to chemotherapy. This pattern is what would be expected from treatment 
with a PD-1 inhibitor bearing in mind that immune-mediated AEs –although relatively infrequent– can 
have fatal outcomes. Overall, toxicity from cemiplimab is considered manageable.  
No new events or concerning high frequencies of any known events were reported in study 1676. 
Importantly, the incidence of AEs across categories of any-grade, high-grade, SAEs, G5 AEs and AEs 
leading to discontinuation does not seem to exhibit a relationship to known PD-L1 status.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. The MAH 
has taken the opportunity to make minor changes to the product information. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The current Type II variation is in relation to an addition of a new therapeutic indication. The application 
is not related to a change in legal status or to a new presentation, and no particular critical safety issues 
Assessment report  
EMA/862705/2022 
Page 130/137 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
have been identified with Libtayo. Proposed changes to the package leaflet are thus minimal and it is 
consequently agreed that a separate user consultation with target patient groups is not required. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
 The indication is for the treatment of adult patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer and 
disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy.  
The aim of such therapy is to improve overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The preferred first line (1L) approach for persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer in Europe 
involves platinum-based chemotherapy, often with paclitaxel, and in some cases, adding bevacizumab, or 
pembrolizumab (if tumour PD-L1 expression CPS ≥1). When progressive disease occurs, single-agent 
chemotherapy –topotecan, vinorelbine, pemetrexed, irinotecan, ifosfamide, among others– can be 
considered in second or ulterior lines, although none of the available choices has shown significant 
survival improvements (median OS <9 months).  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The current application is based on results from Study 1676, an open-label, randomised 1:1, phase III 
trial that compared cemiplimab monotherapy vs. investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (pemetrexed or 
topotecan or irinotecan or gemcitabine or vinorelbine) in women with recurrent or metastatic cervical 
cancer after progression to platinum-based chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab. 608 patients 
were recruited between November 2017 and July 2020, regardless of PD-L1 expression status, but only 
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) or adenocarcinoma/adenosquamous carcinoma (AC) histologies were 
allowed. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints were PFS, ORR, DOR and 
QoL.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
•  The study met its primary endpoint. After 65% of OS events and with a median follow-up of 18.2 
months on data cut-off 04-JAN-2021, improved survival from cemiplimab (mOS 12.0 months) over 
investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (mOS 8.5 months) was shown: HR for OS 0.68 (95% CI 0.56, 
0.84), p-value 0.00011. The survival benefit was evident across both SCC and AC subpopulations of 
the trial, all prespecified subgroups and sensitivity analyses. In an updated exploratory OS analysis 
(data cut-off 04-JAN-2022) with median follow-up of 30.2 months and 76% of event maturity, the 
survival benefit from cemiplimab over chemotherapy was maintained (HR: 0.66, 95% CI 0.55, 0.79). 
•  PFS at 86% of event maturity was also statistically improved in the cemiplimab arm [HR 0.745 (95% 
CI 0.625, 0.89), p-value 0.00048], although K-M estimates of median PFS were almost equivalent in 
both arms: 2.8 for cemiplimab and 2.9 for chemotherapy.  
•  Albeit responses were scant (16% from cemiplimab and 6% from chemotherapy), ORR was also 
statistically improved for cemiplimab vs. chemotherapy.  
Assessment report  
EMA/862705/2022 
Page 131/137 
 
 
 
 
•  An exploratory OS analysis of the 254 patients with known PD-L1 status (i.e., biomarker-available 
population, 42% of the ITT) was presented. Among these samples, 64% were PD-L1≥1% and 36% 
were PD-L1<1%. At the most updated exploratory OS analysis on 04-JAN-2022, the hazard ratio for 
the PD-L1≥ 1% group was 0.70 (95% CI: 0.48, 1.01) and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.53, 1.36) for the PD-
L1<1% group. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
•  The magnitude of efficacy in subgroups indicate that PD-L1 expression might act as a relevant effect 
modifier. Recognising that efficacy will increase with increasing PD-L1 expression, this is understood 
as a continuum 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
•  Most patients in both arms of Study 1676 experienced an AE of any grade. The most frequent AEs in 
the cemiplimab arm were: anaemia 25%, nausea 18.3%, fatigue 16.7% and vomiting 16%. The most 
frequent AEs in the chemotherapy arm were: anaemia 44.5%, nausea 33.4%, vomiting 23.4%, 
pyrexia 21%. AEs and AEs of grade ≥3 were more frequent in the chemotherapy arm.  
•  The most prevalent grade ≥3 AEs were as expected: anaemia, urinary tract infection and 
hypokalaemia in the cemiplimab arm, while all events in the chemotherapy arm fall within the 
category of blood & lymphatic disorders.  
•  SAEs, AEs resulting in death and discontinuation due to AEs were slightly more frequent in the 
cemiplimab arm.  
•  SAEs were registered in 29.7% (cemiplimab) vs 26.9% (chemotherapy). The most frequent SAEs in 
both arms were infections (10.7%/11.4%) and gastrointestinal disorders (4.3%/4.8%). 
Autoimmune/immune-mediated hepatitis (1.3%/1%) only occurred in the cemiplimab arm. Of note, 
the incidence of hepatitis as a composite term (including autoimmune hepatitis, immune-mediated 
hepatitis, hepatic function abnormal, hepatitis, hepatotoxicity, hepatic failure and hepatocellular 
injury) is 2.6%. Pneumonitis was more frequent in the cemiplimab arm (1%/0.3%) whereas 
haematologic SAEs (1.7%/6.9%) were more frequent in the chemotherapy arm.  
•  AEs resulting in death in the cemiplimab arm (1.7%) occurred in 4 out of 5 patients, not considered to 
be treatment-related. In the chemotherapy arm (0.7%, 2 patients), both fatalities were considered 
treatment-related. 
•  15.7% of patients in the cemiplimab arm vs 0.7% in the chemotherapy arm experienced any imAE, 
grade ≥3 5.3% vs 0.7%, serious imAEs and discontinuation 5% vs 0.7%. Fewer patients in pool 1 
(15.7%) had any imAE compared to pool 2 (20.5%). In line with the established imAEs profile of 
cemiplimab, the most frequent imAEs were endocrine disorders 8%, hepatobiliary disorders 3.3% and 
skin & subcutaneous disorders 1.7%. 
•  Particularly in the cemiplimab arm, no specific pattern of toxicity that would indicate higher rates of 
all-grade, high-grade, G5 AEs, imAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation in the PD-L1<1% vs. PD-DL1
≥1% subpopulations seems present although SAEs occurred in 39% vs. 28% of patients (PD-L1<1% 
and PD-DL1≥1% subgroups).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Cervical cancer still represents a major public health problem in Europe despite availability of HPV 
vaccines and widespread screening programs, noting five-year relative survival of ~62% between 2000–
2007. Surgery and chemoradiotherapy constitute the mainstay of treatment for local/locoregional 
disease, while systemic therapy with cisplatin plus paclitaxel and bevacizumab remains the preferred 
approach to recurrent or metastatic disease, regardless of histology. While the addition of bevacizumab 
was supported by a survival benefit shown at the GOG 240 study (Tewari et al, NEJM 2014), the role of 
added immunotherapy in first line has been recently established (Keytruda EPAR).  
Diverse single-agent approaches assayed beyond progression to initial systemic treatment have shown 
modest response rates, although none has proved a significant survival advantage.

Upon this major unmet medical need, and considering promising efficacy data from phase I Study 1423, 
the MAH for Libtayo designed and successfully conducted Study 1676, which compared cemiplimab vs. 
investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (among gemcitabine, pemetrexed, vinorelbine, topotecan or 
irinotecan) in the targeted population of women with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer with 
progressive disease after initial chemotherapy.  
While a positive outcome favouring cemiplimab was seen across the primary (OS) and secondary efficacy 
endpoints, the magnitude of efficacy in subgroups indicate that PD-L1 expression might act as a relevant 
effect modifier in this setting: data from the exploratory survival analysis in patients from the trial with 
available PD-L1 samples suggests that efficacy improves with increasing PD-L1 expression.   
Regarding safety, the overall toxicity profile of cemiplimab is in line with its anti-PD-1 mechanism of 
action, and compares favourably with chemotherapy in Study 1676. Immune-mediated AEs occurred in a 
substantial proportion of patients treated with cemiplimab, albeit mostly of low-grade and thus 
manageable. Overall, safety results from cemiplimab in Study 1676 (n=300) are similar to those of the 
safety pool from the cemiplimab monotherapy trials (n=1116). Of note, no new events or concerningly 
high frequencies of any known events were registered in the cited pivotal trial. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Ultimately, a median survival improvement of ~4 months is considered a clinically relevant achievement 
of cemiplimab for women with advanced cervical cancer after progression to first line chemotherapy with 
platinum compounds.  
The observed safety profile of cemiplimab appears consistent with the one expected for its 
pharmacological class. Toxicity is considered manageable and acceptable with no new events or 
concerningly high frequencies of any known events registered in study 1676. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Acknowledging that exploratory data suggest that PD-L1 expression is a relevant effect modifier, efficacy 
estimates indicate that survival benefits were also observed in the underpowered PD-L1<1% subgroup. 
Overall, it was deemed reasonable not to restrict the therapeutic indication (see section 4.1 of SmPC) 
based on PD-L1 expression levels. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of cemiplimab as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with recurrent or 
metastatic cervical cancer and disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy, is positive. 
4.  Recommendations

DIVERGENT POSITION DATED 13 OCTOBER 2022 
LIBTAYO EMEA/H/C/004844/II/0026 
The undersigned member of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion recommending 
the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation of LIBTAYO. 
The reason for divergent opinion was the following: 
Study 1676 demonstrated a benefit in overall survival for cemiplimab compared to investigators' choice 
of chemotherapy. PD-L1 is a possible predictor of response, based on the mechanism of action and on 
external data with other immunotherapies, and therefore it is considered of interest to investigate and 
scrutinize the relative sub-groups. Yet, the trial recruited patients irrespective of PD-L1 status but PD-L1 
status was not routinely collected and it is missing or not sufficiently reliable in about 60% of 
the population and based on a non-validated assay, limiting the interpretation of the results in relevant 
sub-groups. This is regarded as a relevant limitation of the study design, preventing a thorough 
assessment of the B/R in the overall population. 
Notwithstanding the above-mentioned limitations, taking into account the totality of evidence, a positive 
B/R could be agreed in the PD-L1-positive subgroup. On the contrary, the absence of external data 
backing a benefit in the PD-L1 low expressors/negative population and a hazard ratio for overall survival 
of 0.846 (0.527; 1.357) in this sub-population versus comparators with undemonstrated efficacy on this 
end-point make the data/trial inadequate and insufficiently robust to inform on a benefit in the PD-L1 
negative population.

Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/11/2009 on the granting of a product-specific waiver. At the time of the EMA Decision, Cervarix was 
already authorised for use in girls from 10 years of age onwards. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Cervarix is a prophylactic vaccine which contains 20µg per 0.5 mL dose of HPV-16 L1 protein and 20µg 
per 0.5ml dose of HPV-18 L1 protein assembled as virus-like particles (VLPs) as active ingredients. The 
L1 proteins are formulated with AS04 adjuvant system, which is composed of 50µg of 3-O-desacyl-4'-
mono-phosphoryl-lipid A (MPL) and 500µg of aluminium hydroxide salt. The vaccine is preservative-
free. 
Cervarix was first registered in 2007 and the vaccine is currently licensed for use in more than 110 
countries worldwide. In Europe, Cervarix is indicated for use from the age of 9 for the prevention of 
premalignant cervical lesions and cervical cancer causally related to certain oncogenic Human 
Papillomavirus (HPV) types.  
The use of Cervarix should be in accordance with official recommendations. The vaccination course 
consists of three doses administered according to a 0, 1, 6 month schedule via intramuscular injection. 
The purpose of this variation is to provide the results from the analysis of study HPV-010 (Month 7 and 
Month 36). Study HPV-010 demonstrated the non-inferiority and superiority of the immune response 
(superiority of Cervarix to qHPV vaccine in terms of immune response measured by PBNA at Month 36) 
elicited by Cervarix over qHPV vaccine in women aged 18-45 years. The study results did not contain 
efficacy data related to the proposed variation. Based on the approved indication for qHPV vaccines 
and the immunogenicity data of study HPV-010, the MAH proposed to infer efficacy to Cervarix for 
premalignant vulvar and vaginal lesions in women and young girls aged 9 and above. The efficacy of 
Cervarix against vulvar and vaginal lesions was assessed as exploratory endpoints in the efficacy study 
HPV-008. The results of this analysis were submitted as supportive evidence. 
In addition, a review of the scientific evidence supporting the extension of the indication to encompass 
protection against premalignant vulvar and vaginal lesions was provided.

2.2.  Background 
Lower genital tract neoplasia comprises cervical, vaginal and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), 
which in a small proportion of cases, progresses to invasive cancer. Virtually 100% of cervical, about 
43% of vulvar, and approximately 70% of vaginal tumors are attributable to human papillomavirus 
infection annually (see Table 1) generating 530,000 cervical and 21,000 vulvar and vaginal cancers 
worldwide (Lowy 2012, Forman 2012). In the absence of a screening strategy, there has been an 
increase in the incidence of VIN and vulvar cancer in younger women (van de Nieuwenhof 2009). 
Treatment standards for HPV-associated anogenital lesions have primarily been by surgical excision. 
Screening identifies high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2/3) mainly in women of 
reproductive age with current treatment strategies very effective in eliminating the abnormal HPV-
infected precancerous cells while minimizing harm to the cervical integrity (Stern, 2012).

Forman 2012 with data sourcing from de Martel 2012) 
a Numbers rounded to two significant digits 
The standard of care for treating VIN has been, and remains, surgical excision for unifocal disease and 
lesions suspicious for possible invasion. More problematic is multifocal disease, which can affect a large 
proportion of the vulva (Herod 1996). Excision of such a large area of vulvar skin can result in loss of 
vulvar contours and sexual function, which can have a profound effect on a woman’s self-esteem and 
quality of life (Shylasree 2008). Treatment failure in VIN is not only common, but risks development of 
invasive disease, which only adds to the challenge. These difficulties mean that surgical excision is not 
an optimal means of treating multifocal disease. Laser ablation has the advantage of precise 
application and avoidance of skin loss, but it is associated with a high rate of treatment failure. Vulvar 
cancer relies on surgery for localized disease and a combination of surgery and chemoradiation for 
nodal metastases. Only in very advanced disease, where surgery would necessitate defunctioning 
bowel or urinary tract, is chemoradiation preferred as sole therapy. The major development in vulvar 
cancer surgery in recent years has been sentinel node biopsy, which offers the means to avoid full 
groin dissection in sentinel node-negative women, thus reducing the risk of lower limb lymphoedema, 
which can be very disabling (RCOG 2011, Stern 2012).  
Interestingly, vulvar or vaginal high grade lesions can result from intraepithelial spreading of single 
transformed cell clones initiated in the cervical region (Daling 2002, Vinokurova 2005, Hampl 2007). 
These findings reinforce the expectation that a vaccine highly efficacious against cervical disease will 
be efficacious against HPV-related vulvar and vaginal disease (Hampl 2006).  
The overall impact of Cervarix on cervical lesions has been established in a large efficacy study in naïve 
young women aged 15 to 25 years. The vaccine was virtually 100% effective (95% CI: 81.8-100) 
against high grade cervical lesions (CIN3+) with HPV 16 or 18 (ATP cohort for efficacy using HPV type 
assignment analysis (TAA)) and protected against 93.2% (95% CI: 78.9; 98.7) of CIN 3 lesions, 
irrespective of the HPV type1 (Paavonen 2009). If the casual types and mechanisms of infection by 
HPV are similar for cervical and vulvar/vaginal diseases it can be reasonably expected that the vaccine 
will also protect against HPV-related vulvar and vaginal disease.

2.2.1.  Natural history of papillomaviruses infection: Uptake and 
internalisation – Animal challenge models 
HPV is a small virus of 55 nm diameter and comprises a double-stranded circular DNA of nearly 8000 
base pairs. The HPV genome encodes eight proteins: early proteins E5, E6 and E7 are involved in cell 
proliferation and survival, and E6 and E7 play a key role in HPV-associated carcinogenesis; three other 
early proteins (E1, E2 and E4) are involved in control of viral gene transcription and viral DNA 
replication; two late proteins L1 and L2 are involved in assembly of new virus particles. The virus 
particle is composed of 72 capsomeres each composed of major L1 and minor L2 capsid proteins. The 
virus has evolved a replication cycle which is intimately linked to the life history of the differentiating 
epithelial cell where the small number of HPV genes coordinate in function with the host cell’s own 
mechanisms to support viral replication and the production of large numbers of new infectious virions.  
The dependence on epithelial differentiation for virion production has limited the study of the early 
steps in infection by native oncogenic HPV. However, using HPV L1 pseudo-virion particles, self-
assembling proteins that resemble the HPV L1 capsid, in both in vitro and in vivo animal models has 
established some of the key factors involved. Heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPG) are the primary 
attachment factors for most HPV types (Shafti-Keramat 2003). These are ubiquitously expressed on 
mammalian cells and are integral components of the basement membrane (BM) and extracellular 
matrix that surrounds most tissues. It is thought that minor damage to the target exposure of the BM 
allowing for a primary step of viral capsid binding with a subsequent adsorption to the basal surface of 
epithelial cells during their regrowth and repair, which enables virion uptake. On virion binding, there is 
a capsid conformational change which exposes an L2 furin consensus site providing for N-terminal 
cleavage and further capsid structural alteration facilitating binding to an unknown cell receptor; 
subsequent internalisation can occur relatively rapidly (Richards 2006) (see Figure 1). This is 
consistent with the requirement of the minor capsid protein L2 for production of fully infectious HPV 
virions. An elegant murine cervicovaginal challenge model showed that HPV 16 L1/L2 pseudo-virion 
particles that resemble papillomavirus (Buck 2007) can cause widespread infection of epithelia within 
48-72 hours (Roberts 2007). This time is insufficient for inducing a primary immune response leading 
to production of neutralizing antibodies or even for reactivating a memory immune response if levels of 
antibodies in situ are not high enough to thwart the infection. Once the viral genome is inside the cell, 
neutralizing antibodies against capsid proteins will be useless.  
Recent studies describe the use of the cervicovaginal challenge murine model of HPV infection to 
dissect distinct steps in the process and the nature of the vaccine-induced antibodies that can interfere 
(Kines 2009, Day 2010). Importantly, the data emphasise how cell culture methods are unable to 
mimic the in vivo conditions and thus give potentially misleading results. This work provides formal 
proof that antibodies mediate the protective capacity of HPV VLP vaccines and a means for further 
refinement of the specificities and mechanisms involved. The in vivo model delineates the initial steps 
of HPV infection as taking place at the basement membrane (BM) followed by transition of the L1/L2 
capsids to a furin (-like) protease cleaved version with exposure of L2 epitopes necessary for stable 
association with the epithelial target cell (Figure 1). L1 VLP vaccine induced protection was shown to 
include at least two distinct mechanisms mediated by polyclonal antibodies which are concentration 
dependent. High antibody levels can block binding to HSPG on the BM but lower amounts can block the 
secondary L1 receptor on epithelial cells. In the latter case, the number of different epitopes 
recognized has not been determined. As previously described (Gambhira 2007), anti-L2 antibody can 
also prevent binding and infection on the epithelial targets and importantly are not HPV type specific.

Figure 1.  In vivo events leading to PV uptake by keratinocytes (Reproduced from Schiller 2010) 
After the virus has entered cells in the basal layer of the epithelium, the genome is uncoated and 
transferred to the cell’s nucleus where it exists as a non-integrated circular episome of less than 100 
copies per cell; it is possible that the target cells include the reserve, or stem cell, population. The 
molecular and cell biology underwriting the natural history of the virus infection are intimately 
entwined (Roberts 2009). As these infected basal cells undergo cell division, the viral genome 
replicates and becomes equally segregated between the two daughter cells enabling maintenance of 
the HPV genome in this cell layer. New virus production is inhibited in the initial basal target cells and 
the productive infection process only begins with their migration upwards as suprabasal cells to 
generate the tissue architecture and maintain its constant renewal. In uninfected epithelium the 
upward migration of basal cells triggers their exit from the cell cycle and they enter the pathway of 
terminal differentiation. HPV relies upon the host cell for provision of key replication enzymes and 
other factors necessary to replicate its own genome and its HPV E6 and E7 proteins stimulate 
continued proliferation of the infected suprabasal cells (and therefore production of the cell’s replication 
machinery) to potentiate survival long enough for the virus to replicate its own genome. Once the virus 
has amplified its genome, sometimes to levels exceeding many thousands of copies per cell, the HPV 
life cycle then switches to production of the coat proteins L1 and L2. This stage is controlled by the 
early E2 protein that down-regulates E6 and E7 protein expression by blocking the binding of 
transcription factors to the early virus promoter allowing the cell to continue the process of terminal 
differentiation. New virions are thus assembled in the uppermost cells of the lesion which undergo 
apoptosis and are sloughed off as the tissue is renewed from below (Conway 2009). If all the progeny 
of an initially infected stem cell differentiate with no reinfection, then the HPV infection will be 
selflimiting. On the other hand, if an infected stem cell remains out of cycle but with viral episomes, 
this provides the basis of a latent infection which could be revealed at some later time when there is a 
call for epithelial differentiation. An anogenital cancer is a late and rare complication of a persistent 
oncogenic type HPV infection and is the end result of a chain of events that can take many years to 
unfold - infection with HPV is a necessary initial event, but not a sufficient cause of cervical cancer. 
2.2.2.  Immune Evasion of HPV 
The relatively poor humoral immunity detected in many individuals naturally exposed to oncogenic HPV 
infection is a consequence of a multifaceted adaption of HPV to avoid or hide from effective immune 
control. In some cases this allows for persistent infection and subsequent transforming events driven 
by genomic instability derivative from viral integration and can ultimately lead to the emergence of 
metastatic tumour cells that are also able to avoid critical cellular immunity. Thus, in some cases of 
HPV infection the sentinel or antigen presenting cells may fail to notice the infection. Without activation 
of the innate immunity no appropriate controlling proinflammatory response or adaptive immune

recruitment occurs. Importantly if the antigen presenting cells (APCs) identify HPV infection but are not 
properly activated they can send negative signals to the adaptive immune mechanisms inducing 
immune tolerance, thereby anergizing effectors which could otherwise combat the infection (Stanley 
2007). The virus stealth strategy and only low expression of viral early gene targets within the basal 
and immediate suprabasal layers of the stratified squamous epithelium can fail to activate the local 
APCs. While the virions are highly immunogenic structures they are made only in the apical cell layers 
of the epithelium already committed to terminal differentiation and thus unavailable to engage with the 
local immune surveillance mechanisms. Langerhans’ cells may in fact be resistant to direct activation 
by viral particle structures in contrast to dendritic cells (Fausch 2002), and in cervical intraepithelial 
neoplasia (CIN) there is a reduction in numbers and a change in their phenotype (Giannini 2002, Tay 
1987, Guess 2005, Connor 1999, Hubert 2005). The virus has involved additional strategies to limit 
immune activation including E6 and E7 modulation of the infected cells sensitivity to anti-viral 
responses of the tissue such as production of interferons (Nees 2000, Chang 2000, Barnard 1999, Li 
1999), other inflammatory mediators (Cho 2001), TLR9 activation (Hasan 2007) and E5 mediated 
down-regulation of HLA expression (Zhang 2003), all of which facilitate persistent HPV infection. With 
the latter, the viral and host genomes can become integrated leading to failure to respond to apoptotic 
signals and failure of programmed cell death as well as cellular immortalization. The increased 
expression of viral E6 and E7 oncoproteins interferes with the tumor suppressor genes which guard the 
host genome by delaying DNA replication if genes are damaged and normally allows sufficient time for 
their repair (Duensing 2004). When such errors occur, mutant cells will be generated and the 
properties enabling unlimited growth, avoidance of immune surveillance and spread will be selected 
with time and recognized as an invasive cancer. With persistent HPV infection, CIN or invasive cancer, 
the constitutive expression of the E6 and E7 oncogenes can provide for chronic antigenic stimulation of 
the specific T cells. However, the absence of the necessary co-stimulation provided but by optimal APC 
activation this can induce an anergic response (Kalinski 1999). Further, T regulatory cells (Treg), which 
are usually induced as a part of the homeostatic control of immune responses acting to reduce the 
levels of virus specific cellular immunity when the danger has passed (Wang 2004) can also be induced 
by these conditions, and contribute to tolerance of viral antigens and the promotion of neoplasia 
(Belkaid 2009). There are several studies showing increased numbers of Treg in HPV-associated 
diseases as well as tumors of different types including those of the cervix (van der Burg 2007, 
Fattorossi 2004, Molling 2007). These effectors can suppress the activity of cytotoxic cells either 
directly or by the production of cytokines like IL10 and tumour growth factor (TGF)-beta. In studies of 
recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP), a disease caused by HPV-6 and -11 (two common but low 
oncogenic risk HPV types that also infect the cervix), there is a dramatic polarization of cell mediated 
immune responses that are biased towards Th2-like T-cells, cytokine and chemokine repertoires 
(Bonagura 1999, Bonagura 2004, DeVoti 2008, DeVoti 2004, Rosenthal 2005, Rosenthal 2006, 
Rosenthal 2008), and increased number of CD4+, Foxp3, regulatory Tcells (Treg) (Hatam 2008) in 
diseased, but not in normal laryngeal tissues.  
2.2.3.  Host tropism 
To date, more than 180 papillomaviruses genotypes have been identified, based on their L1 sequence. 
HPVs display a preference regarding the site of infection, cutaneous or mucosal. Furthermore, highly 
homologous HPV types such as HPV6 or HPV11 (85% L1 identity) can have different site predilection. 
In an attempt to identify whether the tissue specificity is determined at the level of infectious entry 
(basement membrane binding to episomal integration), Handisurya et al used murine models for skin 
infection and mucosal cervicovaginal challenge using various L1L2 pseudovirions (human cutaneous 
types HPV5, 8, human mucosal low risk types HPV6,44 and high risk types HPV16,18,26,45,51,58, 
bovine BPV1 and murine MusPV1). In both cases the disruption of the epithelium was required. Using 
Assessment report

the skin murine model, no difference in patterns of pseudovirion entry was noted among individual 
pseudovirion types tested (HPV5, HPV16, MusPV1 and BPV1). The authors also tested the ability of 
diverse pseudovirions to infect murine tissues of cutaneous and mucosa-genital origin, following local 
abrasion or scarification. Although differences in terms of kinetics of infection were observed, it 
appeared that the infectivity of both tissues by pseudovirions was similar. The conclusion is that 
differences in the mechanism of viral entry do not account for tissue type or species-specific tropism of 
infection and that these must be determined by post-entry events (Handisurya, 2012). 
2.3.  Immunogenicity aspects 
Since it is not possible to easily recapitulate the virus natural history of infection for the purposes of a 
high through put assay of antibody neutralising activity, all assays (ELISA, competitive Luminex (cLIA), 
PBNA or cervicovaginal murine challenge) are surrogates for activity in preventing natural infection in 
vaccinees. Each individual assay is able to detect overlapping activities but also distinct activities (e.g. 
ELISA and PBNA in Dessy 2008). Each individual assay may or may not encompass the complete range 
of antibody specificity, affinity or titre relevant in prevention of PV infection in the anogenital tract. The 
VLP induced antibodies are generally type specific and this may include recognition of different 
epitopes, with a range of affinity and where higher concentration may provide for cross reactivity 
against related types. Vaccination by L1-based HPV vaccine such as Cervarix induces high titres of 
neutralizing antibodies in serum of vaccinees, as measured using vaccine independent PBNA. 
Antibodies may either transudate (e.g., into cervico-vaginal secretions) or exudate at the site of 
infection. The current paradigm for prevention of HPV infection is that at high concentrations, vaccine-
elicited L1 neutralizing antibodies located at the infection site coat the HPV capsids and neutralize the 
virus preventing entry into its target cells. The cervicovaginal challenge model does show VLP type 
specificity and cross protection similar to that documented in clinical efficacy studies (Day 2010, 
Paavonen 2009). While providing insights into processes likely more relevant to real infection in the 
genital tract than in vitro studies, the model is still a surrogate. It uses HPV L1/L2 pseudovirions for 
passive challenge and the multiplicity conditions of infection are obviously not physiological. It also 
does not exclude other methods of infection not dependent on exposure of the basement membrane 
and epithelial regrowth.  
The role of antibodies in preventing HPV infection has been shown using different surrogate models. In 
the mouse model using HPV16 pseudovirions for cervicovaginal infection, it was shown using confocal 
microscopy that an intact genital epithelium was resistant to infection by HPV16 L1L2 pseudovirus. In 
contrast, gentle mechanical abrasion of the genital epithelium with a cytobrush that exposes the 
basement membrane permitted detectable levels of pseudovirus infection. A similar effect was 
observed following vaginal treatment with nonoxynol-9 (N-9), a non-ionic surfactant widely use as 
spermicide and known to disrupt the normal architecture of human and animal genital epithelium. 
Systemic immunisation by HPV16 L1 VLPs protected the mice against subsequent challenges with 
HPV16 L1L2 pseudovirus.

Figure 2.   
Virus-like particle (VLP) immunization protects against type-specific pseudovirus challenge. BKV: BK poliomavirus 
(sham vaccine); BPV1: bovine papillomavirus type 1 (Roberts, 2007) 
The specificity of L1 VLP-induced protection from cervicovaginal challenge was examined in mice by 
Day et al in 2010 using HPV16 L1 VLPs (a similar experiment was described by Longet in 21011 using 
the quadrivalent HPV vaccine). In this study, partial protection was observed against HPV31 and no 
protection was shown against HPV58 or HPV45. Further experiments of serum passive transfer from a 
rabbit immunized with HPV16 L1 VLPs into naïve mice resulted in strong protection against HPV16 
pseudovirion challenge and no protection from challenge with HPV45. This observation correlates with 
the cross-protective clinical efficacy against HPV31 seen in clinical trials with Cervarix (Paavonen 2009, 
Wheeler 2012) and is consistent with the observation of cross-reactive antibodies in humans (Kemp 
2011). Last, cross-protective efficacy of Cervarix was assessed in a rabbit cutaneous quasivirion (HPV 
L1L2 pseudovirions including CRPV genome, nearly identical to native virions) challenge model, using 
CRPV (cottontail rabbit papillomavirus) as a control. In this model, Cervarix induced high level of 
specific and cross-protection against HPV16, 18, 31 and 45, but only partial protection against HPV58 
(Giannini 2010). 
2.3.1.  Immune response elicited by Cervarix 
Long-term immunogenicity of Cervarix has been studied up to 9.4 years (mean of 8.9 years) after 
initial vaccination of young women 15-25 years in study HPV-001 and their long-term follow-up in 
studies HPV-007/023. Persistence of the immune response against both HPV-16 and HPV-18 antigens 
was observed with 100% of vaccinees remaining seropositive as measured by ELISA up to a mean of 
8.9 years after initial vaccination. The GMTs showed a plateau at approximately one log below the peak 
response level one month after the full vaccination course, without substantial evidence of further 
decline during the long-term follow-up. In addition, all subjects included in the subset for PBNA testing 
(55 subjects in the vaccine and 23 subjects in the placebo groups in total) of who had received the 
HPV vaccine remained seropositive for neutralizing antibodies against both antigens (PBNA). In the 
Placebo group, none of the subjects had detectable levels of neutralizing antibodies against HPV-16 
and HPV-18. The kinetics of the HPV-16 and HPV-18 neutralizing antibodies were similar to the one 
observed by ELISA (Figure 3 and Figure 4). Of note, at completion of study HPV-023 (with a mean of 
8.9 years after initial vaccination),there were no cases of infection or histopathological lesions 
associated with HPV- 16 or HPV-18 in the vaccine group. In the placebo group, there were 4 cases of 
6-month persistent infection and 1 case of 12-month persistent infection (HPV-023; Roteli-Martins, 
2012 for follow-up up to 8.4 years after initial vaccination).

V5/J4 inhibition ELISA or PBNA. The studies also showed that the AS04 formulation elicited an 
increased frequency of L1 VLPs specific memory B cells when compared to an aluminium salt-only 
formulation (2.2 – 5.2 fold increased ratio). Cervarix benefits from the AS04 adjuvant, leading to an 
improved immune response in terms of magnitude and duration and a higher priming quality compared 
to a vaccine containing aluminium salt only (Giannini 2006 and reviewed in Garçon 2011). 
2.4.  Clinical Efficacy aspects  
2.4.1.  Background 
The report from the WHO/ICO HPV information center (February 19, 2010) described an increasing 
evidence linking HPV DNA with cancers in the genital region. Although their incidence is lower as 
compared to cervical cancer, their common cause of HPV infection make them potentially preventable 
and subject to similar preventive strategies (Vaccine 2006, Vol 24, Supp 3; Vaccine 2008, Vol 26 Supp 
10; IARC monographs 2007, Vol 90).  
Vulvar and vaginal cancers are rare diseases, representing an estimated 26,800 and 13,200 new cases 
worldwide in 2002, respectively, or about 6% of all gynaecological cancers (www.who.int/hpvcentre). 
The majority of vulvar and vaginal cancers (90%) are squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and tends to be 
reported more frequently in developed countries, indicating a limited impact of preventive cervical 
screening programs on these types of malignancies. Furthermore, there are no dedicated screening 
programs for vaginal and vulvar malignancies.  
HPVs are responsible for virtually 100% of cervical cancers, with types 16 and 18 causing about 70% 
of all cases. Oncogenic HPV DNA is also highly prevalent in many vulvar cancers and most vaginal 
cancers (70-80%). Low grade VIN1 cases were more likely to be associated with low-risk HPV type 
(i.e. HPV-6 or 11) and nearly all high-grade vulvar lesions (VIN3) were associated with HPV-16. It is 
however not clear if low grade lesions associated with low risk types have the potential to progress to 
high grade lesions. HPV-16 was observed in the large majority of VaIN1 cases and half of VaIN3 cases. 
Overall, the two low risk types HPV-6 and HPV-11 are usually not associated with high grade lesions 
(Srodon, 2006). 
Vaccination with HPV vaccines stimulates the subject’s immune system which elicits antibodies (both 
neutralizing and non-neutralizing) against the HPV L1 VLPs contained in the vaccines. Following a 
subsequent infection by HPV, the current paradigm is that L1 neutralizing antibodies elicited by 
vaccination which are located at the surface of the cervix will coat the HPV capsids and prevent their 
interaction with the basal membrane of the epithelium. At lower concentrations, L1 neutralizing 
antibodies may not prevent binding to the basement membrane, but may rather prevent the molecular 
conformational changes required for the virus to bind and then infect the epithelium cells (Schiller, 
2010, Day, 2010). No serological correlate of protection has been established for HPV vaccines, 
however high levels of neutralizing antibodies against HPV-16/18 are indicative of an effective 
protection against HPV infection. Since women may be at risk for acquisition of HPV infection for as 
long as they are sexually active, vaccination needs to induce high levels of antibodies to provide long-
term protective efficacy. Cervarix has demonstrated its ability to generate high levels of antibodies that 
transudate to the cervix and confer efficacy against HPV-related high grade cervical lesions in clinical 
studies. It is also supposed that the induced immune memory plays a role in the longer-term 
protection, when lower or non-detectable levels of antibodies are present at the infection site (Joura, 
2008, Moscicki, 2010). 
In the goal of comparing the immune response elicited by the two HPV vaccines, study HPV-010 is 
being conducted in women aged 18 to 45 years and provided up to three years of comparison data

(the study is planned for five years). To allow for the comparison between the two vaccines, and in line 
with the WHO guidelines (WHO, 2006), a vaccine-independent assay (pseudovirion based 
neutralization assay - PBNA) was used to measure the levels of neutralizing antibodies elicited against 
HPV-16 and HPV-18 following vaccination. Although it is acknowledged that superiority in terms of 
antibody levels may not directly transpose into clinical superiority which would be difficult to assess in 
the context of clinical trials, a similar clinical efficacy can be reasonably expected from a vaccine 
eliciting higher levels of neutralizing antibodies as compared to another vaccine for which efficacy has 
been demonstrated. This immunological bridging approach is also supported by the natural history of 
HPV infection, time to disease progression, and by the difficulty to conduct new large scale efficacy 
studies in women with Cervarix whereas a vaccine is already licensed for these indications and widely 
available. This approach is in line with the CHMP guideline on clinical evaluation of new vaccines as 
currently it may not be feasible to perform a lengthy placebo-controlled efficacy study in women 
(EMEA, 2005).  
2.4.2.  Clinical studies  
Study HPV-008 
The efficacy of Cervarix against vulvar and vaginal lesions was assessed as exploratory endpoints in 
the efficacy study HPV-008. These endpoints were not included in the initial HPV-008 study protocol, 
but they were added in a protocol amendment while the study was ongoing. In this study, not all 
subjects were systematically screened for VIN/VaIN: specific vulvo-vaginal examinations were only 
performed in women with abnormal cervical cytology referred for colposcopy. The number of VIN/VaIN 
lesions observed may therefore be an underestimate. 
At the time of the final study analysis, statistically significant vaccine efficacy against VIN1+ or VaIN1+ 
associated with HPV-16/18 was observed in both cohorts: 80.0% (96.1% CI: 0.3;98.1) in the ATP 
cohort and 83.2% (96.1% CI: 20.2;98.4) in the Total Vaccinated Cohort (TVC)-1 cohort. At the end of 
study analysis (Month 48), vaccine efficacy against VIN1+ or VaIN1+ associated with HPV-16/18 was 
75.1% (95% CI: 22.9; 94.0) in According To Protocol (ATP) cohort and 77.7% (95% CI: 32.4; 94.5) in 
TVC-1 (Table 2 and Table 3; Garland, 2011). 
Cases of high grade VIN or VaIN were limited in study HPV-008. At the end of study analysis, there 
were only 9 cases of VIN2+ or VaIN2+ observed in the ATP cohort, of which 2 were in the vaccine 
group (and both caused by HPV-16) and 7 in the control group (4 were attributed to HPV-16 and 3 to 
HPV-18). Vaccine efficacy against VIN2+ for the combined HPV-16/18 endpoint was therefore 71.6% in 
the ATP cohort and 75.0% in TVC-1 (2 cases in the vaccine group and 8 in the control group) with a 
lower limit of the confidence interval below 0 in both cases (Table 2 and Table 3).

Study HPV-010 
HPV-10 was a phase IIIb, observer-blind, multicenter, randomized (1:1) trial with two parallel groups 
in healthy females 18-45 years of age: 
•  One group received the GSK HPV vaccine (N=553) 
•  One group received the Gardasil vaccine (N=553) 
Enrollment into each treatment group was age-stratified with a slightly greater number of subjects in 
the 18-26 year-old cohort (417 subjects) than in the 27-35 year-old cohort (356 subjects) or the 36-
45 year-old cohort (333 subjects). Three doses of vaccine were administered according to the 
recommended schedule for GSK HPV vaccine (0, 1, 6-months) and Gardasil (0, 2, 6-months). To 
maintain blinding, all subjects received injections at Months 0, 1, 2 and 6. Placebo [Al(OH)3] was 
administered at either Month 2 (GSK HPV recipients) or Month 1 (Gardasil recipients). The subjects, 
investigator, study personnel and MAH staff will remain blinded until completion of study follow-up. 
The method of data collection occurred through Remote Data Entry (RDE). Five visits were scheduled 
per subject on Day 0, at Months 1, 2, 6 and 7 in the active phase. Additionally, there were to be 6 
follow-up study visits scheduled at Months 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 60. A cervical sample was collected 
from all subjects for HPV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing on Day 0. Blood samples of 20 mL were 
to be collected from all subjects on Day 0, at Months 6, 7, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 60 for evaluation of 
antibody response. An additional 50 mL blood sample on Day 0, at Months 7, 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48 
was to be collected for evaluation of CMI response in a subset of subjects from pre-selected sites. CVS 
were to be collected for HPV-16/18 antibody testing on Day 0, at Months 7, 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48 in a 
subset of subjects from preselected sites.  
The safety of both vaccines was monitored during the follow-up phase as follows: 
All serious adverse events (SAEs), new onset chronic diseases (NOCDs), and other medically significant 
conditions (MSCs) occurring throughout the study period were to be reported in all subjects regardless 
of causal relationship to vaccination and intensity. 
All pregnancies and their outcomes were to be reported.

2.4.3.3.  Statistical methods 
Analyses were performed as planned in the protocol and in the report analysis plan (RAP). Changes 
implemented in the analyses include the following: 
Fewer CVS samples than planned were evaluable. Several changes in the planned analyses were 
implemented as result of the lower number of evaluable samples. 
Some analyses were simplified to avoid multiple analyses on sub-cohorts. All sub-analyses will be 
performed at Month 60 (final analysis). 
Demographics: 
Demographic characteristics (age, ethnicity and race) of each study cohort were tabulated. The mean 
age (plus range and standard deviation [SD]) of each study cohort, as a whole, and per group, was 
calculated. 
Immunogenicity: 
The primary analysis is based on the Month 36 ATP cohort for analysis of immunogenicity (M36 ATP 
cohort for immunogenicity). 
For each serology assay (PBNA and/or ELISA), for each treatment group (GSK HPV and Gardasil), for 
each age group (18-26, 27-35 and 36-45 years of age), at each time point that a blood sample result 
was available: 
Seropositivity rates for HPV-16, HPV-18, HPV-31 and HPV-45 antibodies (with exact 95% confidence 
interval [CI]) were calculated, GMT with 95% CI and range of antibody titers were tabulated for 
antibodies against HPV-16, HPV-18, HPV-31 and HPV-45. 
The distribution of antibody titers for HPV-16 and HPV-18 was displayed using reverse cumulative 
distribution curves (RCCs) in subjects seronegative for the corresponding antigen at Day 0. In addition, 
exploratory inferential analyses were performed to compare the two vaccine groups. 
The analysis of the T-cell and B-cell response was performed by presenting the percentage of 
responders and descriptive statistical parameters. Exploratory inferential analyses were performed to 
compare the two vaccine groups. 
The analysis of antibody titers measured by ELISA in CVS was also performed. The correlation between 
the serum and CVS antibody titers was calculated using the Pearson correlation coefficient.

Immunogenicity data sets analysed 
The primary analysis of immunogenicity (serological analysis of HPV-16, -18, -31 and - 45 by PBNA 
and/or ELISA and CMI analysis of HPV-16, -18, -31 and -45) was performed on the M36 ATP cohort for 
immunogenicity in subjects HPV DNA negative and seronegative for the corresponding type at 
baseline. Additional analysis for immunogenicity (M36 ATP cohort) were done irrespective of subject’s 
initial HPV DNA and serostatus. 
A secondary analysis based on the M36 TVC was performed to complement the ATP analysis. The M36 
TVC was also the primary population for the immunogenicity exploratory superiority assessment. 
In addition, the CVS analysis of HPV-16 and -18 by ELISA was performed in the M36 TVC as primary 
analysis and in the M36 ATP cohort for immunogenicity as secondary analysis.  
2.4.4.1.  HPV-16 (PBNA) Immune response in seronegative (by PBNA) and DNA negative (by

An overview of the seropositivity rates and GMTs for HPV-16 neutralizing antibodies at Month 36 (i.e. 
two and a half years after receiving the last vaccine dose) for subjects who were seronegative and DNA 
negative at baseline is shown in Table 5. A graphical presentation of the GMTs at each time point and 
for each age group separately is shown in Figure 6. For all age groups combined, HPV-16 neutralizing 
antibodies GMTs measured by PBNA in women who had cleared natural infection (i.e., seropositive and 
DNA negative at Month 0 for the HPV antigen under analysis) were 180.1 ED50 [Einstein, 2009].

GMR: Geometric mean ratio; GSK-HPV vaccine: Cervarix 
The GMT ratio (GSK HPV vaccine/Gardasil) was used to assess the between-group comparisons for 
non-inferiority. As the lower limits of the 95% CIs were greater than 0.5, non-inferiority of the GSK 
HPV vaccine over Gardasil at Month 36 was demonstrated for all age groups studied (see Table 6).

2.4.4.2.  HPV-18 (PBNA) Immune response in seronegative (by PBNA) and DNA negative (by 
PCR) subjectsat baseline (M36 ATP cohort for immunogenicity) 
A graphical presentation of the GMTs at each time point and for each age group separately is shown in 
Figure 4. For all age groups combined, HPV-18 neutralizing antibodies GMTs measured by PBNA in 
women who had cleared natural infection (i.e., seropositive and DNA negative at Month 0 for the HPV 
antigen under analysis)] were 137.3 ED50 [Einstein, 2009]. This natural infection level is included in 
these graphs. 
For seronegative and DNA negative subjects at baseline, HPV-18 antibody levels were higher in the 
GSK HPV vaccine group when compared to the Gardasil group for all age strata (see Table 8). 
• 
• 
• 
In the 18-26 age group, HPV-18 GMTs in the GSK HPV vaccine group (1593.7 ED50) were 
12.5-fold higher at Month 36 than in the Gardasil group (127.8 ED50). 
In the 27-35 age group, HPV-18 GMTs in the GSK HPV vaccine group (942.8 ED50) were 9.3-
fold higher at Month 36 than in the Gardasil group (101.9 ED50). 
In the 36-45 age group, HPV-18 GMTs in the GSK HPV vaccine group (903.5 ED50) were 8.8-
fold higher at Month 36 than in the Gardasil group (103.2 ED50).  
In the GSK HPV group, 97.2% to 100 % of initially seronegative and DNA negative subjects were still 
seropositive for HPV-18 antibodies at Month 36 (two subjects in the 36-45 age group did not 
seroconvert at Month 36). In the Gardasil group, 70.5% to 78.9% of subjects were still seropositive for 
HPV-18 antibodies at Month 36.

The GMT ratio (GSK HPV vaccine/Gardasil) was used to assess the between-group comparisons for 
non-inferiority. As the lower limits of the 95% CIs were greater than 0.5, non-inferiority of the GSK 
HPV vaccine over Gardasil was demonstrated for all age groups studied (see Table 7).

As the lower limits of the CIs were greater than 1 for the non-inferiority measurement in all age 
groups, superiority was also tested. The primary analysis for superiority was performed on the TVC 
(regardless of serostatus and DNA status at baseline) as shown in Table 9. Superiority of the GSK HPV 
vaccine over Gardasil was demonstrated for all age groups (ANOVA p < 0.05).

immune  response  (ELISA) 
in  subjects 
seronegative and DNA negative (by PCR) at baseline (M36 ATP cohort for immunogenicity)  
The percentage of subjects seropositive (by ELISA) for antibodies against HPV-31 at Month 36 ranged 
from 53.6% to 81.5% in the GSK HPV vaccine group and from 53.7% to 65.5% in the Gardasil group. 
The percentage of subjects seropositive for antibodies against HPV-45 at Month 36 ranged from 55.4% 
to 84.7% in the GSK HPV vaccine group and from 59.2% to 71.9% in the Gardasil group. 
At Month 36, HPV-31 and HPV-45 antibody levels (by ELISA) were comparable between the vaccine 
groups in all age groups. 
Anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 immune response in cervicovaginal secretions (M36 TVC) 
HPV-16 and HPV-18 antibody positivity rates in CVS as measured by ELISA were 71.7% and 68.3% in 
the  GSK  HPV  vaccine  group,  and  67.7%  and  37.1%  in  the  Gardasil  group,  respectively.  GMTs  for 
antibodies in CVS against HPV-16 and HPV-18 were comparable in each vaccine group.

2.4.4.3.  Cell-mediated immune response (M36 ATP cohort for immunogenicity) 
CD4 T-cell response in subjects seronegative (by PBNA), DNA negative (by PCR) and T-cell 
negative (specific CD4 T-cell < 500 cells/million cells) at baseline 
The proportion of responders for HPV-16 and HPV-18 specific CD4 T-cells (>500 cells/million cells) 
expressing at least two immune markers (CD40L, IFNγ, IL-2 or TNFα) at Month 36 was higher in the 
GSK HPV vaccine group compared to the Gardasil group, but only reached statistical significance for 
HPV-16 (HPV-16: 80.0% vs 40.0%, Fisher p = 0.0322; HPV-18: 54.6% vs 29.4%, Fisher p = 0.1930). 
The proportion of responders for oncogenic non-vaccine types HPV-31 specific CD4 T-cells expressing 
at least two immune markers at Month 36 was significantly higher in the GSK HPV vaccine group 
compared with the Gardasil group for HPV-31 (89.5% vs 45.5%, Fisher p = 0.0038) but did not reach 
statistical significance for HPV-45 (54.6% vs 33.3%, Fisher p = 0.2231). 
Memory B-cell response in subjects seronegative (by PBNA), DNA negative (by PCR) and 
with no detectable B-cells at baseline 
The proportion of subjects with detectable specific memory B-cells (responders) for HPV-16 and HPV-
18 at Month 36 was not significantly different between the vaccine groups (HPV-16: 55.0% vs 
68.8%,Fisher p = 0.5007; HPV-18: 54.6% vs 38.1%, Fisher p = 0.3640). Similarly, the Gmean ratios 
in responders were not significantly different between the vaccine groups (ANOVA p = 0.1106 and p = 
0.2387). 
The proportion of subjects with detectable memory B-cells for HPV-31 and HPV-45 at Month 36 was 
not significantly different between the vaccine groups (HPV-31: 30.0% vs 40.7%, Fisher p = 0.5460; 
HPV-45: 30.4% vs 46.4%, Fisher p = 0.2672). The magnitude of the memory B-cell response in these 
subjects was comparable between the vaccine groups. 
Justification of immunogenicity as a correlate for protection/surrogate endpoint in the 
intended indications 
A correlate of protection has not been established for HPV yet, probably due to the high vaccine 
efficacy and the limited number of cases occurring in clinical trials. Cervarix efficacy studies HPV-008 
and HPV-001/007/023 have demonstrated high vaccine efficacy against histological and virological 
endpoints, while investigating antibody levels elicited by the vaccine in all or a subset of subjects. In 
study HPV-008, GMTs for anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibodies peaked at Month 7 and gradually 
declined until approximately Month 24 and then reached a plateau level. GMTs were well above levels 
elicited after naturally acquired infection at each time point post-vaccination (40.8-fold higher for HPV-
16 and 21.6-fold higher for HPV-18 at Month 48). In study HPV- 001/007, a sustained immune 
response against both HPV-16 and HPV-18 was observed for up to 76 months of follow-up with 
approximately 99% or more of the vaccinees remaining seropositive as measured by ELISA and GMTs 
showing a plateau more than one log above levels associated with naturally acquired HPV-16 or HPV-
18 infection (GlaxoSmithKline Vaccine HPV-007 Study Group 2009). Study HPV-023 confirmed the 
sustained immunogenicity up to 9.4 years (mean of 8.9 years) after initial vaccination. A similar 
pattern of functional antibody responses was observed by HPV-16 and HPV-18 PBNA in both studies. 
In study HPV-008, geometric mean titres in women who had cleared HPV-16 and HPV- 018 following 
natural infection were determined (29.8 EU/mL [95%CI: 28.5; 31.0] and 22.6 [95% CI: 21.6; 23.6], 
respectively, using ELISA). Analysis of the placebo arm of the NCI study HPV-009 (and HPV-008) 
provided additional insights on antibody levels required to reduce the risk of subsequent infection. 
Additional supportive evidence was generated evaluating the vaccine efficacy against VIN2+ and 
VaIN2+ at end of study analysis in HPV-008 as an exploratory endpoint. In total, there were 9 cases of 
Assessment report  
EMA/277891/2013  
Page 24/30 
 
 
 
 
VIN2+ and/or VaIN2+ accrued in the ATP cohort for efficacy, of which 2 were in the vaccine group 
(both attributed to HPV-16) and 7 in the control group (4 were attributed to HPV-16 and 3 to HPV-18). 
Vaccine efficacy estimates were high (71.6% in the ATP cohort and 75.0% in TVC-1). Although 
statistical significance was not reached, likely due to the limited number of cases, analysis of VIN2+ 
and/or VaIN2+ data indicate that these observations are consistent with the vaccine efficacy against 
VIN1+ and/or VaIN1+. 
HPV-16 and HPV-18 are implicated in the development of VIN and VaIN, of which VIN3 and VaIN3 are 
the immediate precursors of vulvar and vaginal invasive cancer. A proportion of extra-cervical lesions 
appear to be clonally related to cervical lesions that have occurred up to several years before. These 
findings suggest that a vaccine that is highly efficacious against cervical disease will probably also be 
efficacious against HPV-related vulvar and vaginal disease.  
VIN1+ and VaIN1+ are not considered to be relevant surrogate endpoints for vulvar and vaginal 
invasive cancer. Supportive evidence was generated evaluating the vaccine efficacy against VIN2+ and 
VaIN2+ at the end of study analysis in HPV-008, where statistical significance was not reached, 
however, likely due to the limited number of cases. These results should therefore be interpreted with 
caution as bias in any direction cannot be excluded due to the low number of cases included in the 
study. 
From data generated in efficacy studies, the link between high antibody levels elicited by the vaccine 
and protection against HPV is clearly established. The data gathered in study HPV-010 allow putting in 
perspective the immune response elicited by each of the two licensed vaccines. 
2.4.5.  Discussion 
The proposed update on the SmPC, to include efficacy of Cervarix for premalignant vulvar and vaginal 
lesions, was based on the approved indication of qHPV vaccines, immunogenicity data from study HPV-
010 (Month 7 and Month 36) and supportive efficacy data for Cervarix from study HPV-008. 
Study HPV-010 demonstrated the non-inferiority and superiority of the immune response (superiority 
of Cervarix to Gardasil in terms of immune response measured by PBNA at Month 36) elicited by 
Cervarix over Gardasil in women aged 18-45 years. Based on the immunological data, the MAH 
proposed to infer efficacy to Cervarix for premalignant vulvar and vaginal lesions in women and young 
girls aged 9 and above. The efficacy of Cervarix against vulvar and vaginal lesions was assessed as 
exploratory endpoints in the efficacy study HPV-008. However, the number of cases of high grade VIN 
or VaIN was very limited. At the end of the study only 9 cases of VIN2+ or VaIN2+ were observed in 
the ATP cohort for efficacy, of which 2 were in the vaccine group (both caused by HPV-16) and 7 in the 
control group (4 were attributed to HPV-16 and 3 to HPV-18). Vaccine efficacy against VIN2+ for the 
combined HPV-16/18 endpoint was therefore 71.6% with a lower limit of the 95% confidence interval 
below 0. In view of the better immune responses observed with Cervarix in comparison with Gardasil  
and the fact that the occurrence of vaginal and vulvar lesions is not independent from previous cervical 
HPV infection or lesions as shown in the literature it can be concluded that Cervarix protects against 
vulvovaginal HPV infection, premalignant lesions and ultimately, cancer.  
During the assessment, the CHMP identified concerns related to the justification to use immunogenicity 
as a correlate for protection/surrogate endpoint in the intended indications.  
The CHMP noted from the MAH response that immunogenicity and efficacy data have established 
Cervarix as a vaccine in the prevention of premalignant cervical lesions causally related to certain 
oncogenic HPV types which are also implicated in the development of vaginal and vulvar invasive 
cancer. The immune response following vaccination, which included the production of neutralizing 
antibodies and L1 VLP specific memory B cells, superseded the levels detected following natural 
infection by HPV-16 and HPV-18. According to the CHMP guideline on the clinical evaluation of new 
Assessment report  
EMA/277891/2013  
Page 25/30 
 
 
 
 
vaccines, in situations in which it is not feasible to perform an efficacy study and there is no 
established immunological correlate of protection, it may sometimes be justifiable to gauge the likely 
efficacy of a vaccine by comparison of immunological responses with those observed in past studies of 
similar vaccines with proven protective efficacy. Efficacy studies to demonstrate the efficacy of 
Cervarix against high grade VIN/VaIN are currently not feasible considering that functional vaccines 
have been commercialised and HPV vaccination is now widely implemented, which makes placebo-
controlled trials non-justifiable. 
In addition, the CHMP consulted the SAG vaccines on the acceptability to use immunogenicity data to 
derive vaccine efficacy of Cervarix for the intended indications. The SAG was of the view that despite 
no measures of immunogenicity are established as correlates of protection against HPV related 
premalignant lesions or cancer, considering the available scientific evidence about Cervarix, including 
its efficacy against premalignant cervical lesions, the available (but limited) descriptive data on VIN 
and VaIN protection, animal model data, and the evidence that protection has an antibody-mediated 
mechanism of action, the SAG agreed unanimously that there was a very high likelihood of actual 
vaccine efficacy against premalignant vulvar and vaginal lesions and that such efficacy could be 
inferred from the aforementioned package of data as a whole. The SAG were of the view that these 
considerations would allow support of the new proposed indication of prevention of premalignant 
genital lesions (cervical, vulvar and vaginal). 
In summary, taken into account the available scientific evidence about Cervarix, including its efficacy 
against premalignant cervical lesions, the available (but limited) descriptive data on VIN and VaIN 
protection, animal model data, and the evidence that protection has an antibody-mediated mechanism 
of actionthe natural history of HPV infection, the CHMP considered that the aforementioned package of 
data as a whole is supportive to include the prevention of premalignant vulvar and vaginal to the 
indication.   
2.5.  Clinical Safety aspects  
The analysis of safety was performed on the TVC (primary analysis) and the ATP safety cohort 
(secondary analysis).  Compliance with completion of the 3-dose vaccination schedule was high in both 
schedule groups, i.e., 84.6% of subjects received all three doses of vaccine in the GSK HPV group and 
84.4% of subjects in the Gardasil group. Similarly, the majority of subjects also received the placebo 
dose (89.9% in the GSK HPV group and 94.0% in the Gardasil group). As such, the majority of 
subjects were compliant with the full vaccination course. 
Safety secondary endpoints of the study were: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The percentage of subjects completing the three-dose vaccination schedule for the study 
vaccines (GSK HPV vaccine and Gardasil). 
The occurrence and intensity of solicited local symptoms (injection site pain, redness and 
swelling) during the 7-day period (Days 0-6) following each and any vaccination in both 
vaccine groups. 
The occurrence, intensity and relationship to vaccination of solicited general symptoms during 
the 7-day period (Days 0-6) following each and any vaccination in both vaccine groups. 
The occurrence, intensity and relationship to vaccination of unsolicited adverse events (AEs) 
during the 30-day period (Days 0-29) following each and any vaccination in both vaccine 
groups. 
The occurrence, intensity and relationship to vaccination of serious adverse events (SAEs) in 
both vaccine groups throughout the study. 
Assessment report

• 
The occurrence, intensity and relationship to vaccination of new onset chronic disease (NOCD; 
e.g. autoimmune disorders, asthma, type I diabetes, allergies, etc.) and other medically 
significant conditions (AEs prompting emergency room or physician visits that are not related 
to common diseases or SAEs that are not related to common diseases) in both groups 
throughout the study regardless of causal relationship to vaccination and intensity. 
2.5.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Statistical Methods: 
The analyses of safety were performed on the TVC for data reported from Month 0 to Month 36. 
Additional analyses were performed on the M36 TVC for data reported from Month 24 to Month 36. 
The  proportion  of  subjects  with  at  least  one  report  of  a  medically  significant  condition  classified  by 
Medical  dictionary  for  Regulatory  Activities  (MedDRA),  whenever  available,  was  calculated  with  exact 
95% CI. 
The proportion of subjects with at least one report of NOCD classified by MedDRA, whenever available, 
was  calculated  with  exact  95%  CI.  A  separate  table  was  produced  for  NOCD  based  on  the  MAH 
assessment and Investigator assessment respectively. 
The proportion of subjects with at least one report of new onset autoimmune disease (NOAD) classified 
by MedDRA, whenever available, was calculated with exact 95% CI.  
2.5.2.  Results 
The analyses of safety were performed on the TVC for data reported from Month 0 to Month 36. 
Additional analyses were performed on the M36 TVC for data reported from Month 24 to Month 36. 
Medically significant conditions 
Up to Month 36, the percentage of subjects experiencing medically significant conditions was 43.2% in 
the GSK HPV vaccine group and 37.1% in the Gardasil group. The most common events in the GSK 
HPV vaccine group included bronchitis (2.7% in GSK HPV vs 1.8% in Gardasil), anxiety (2.4% vs 
2.5%) and depression (2.0% vs 2.4%). The percentage of medically significant conditions reported 
from Month 24 to Month 36 was 13.3% in the GSK HPV vaccine group and 12.6% in the Gardasil 
group. 
New onset chronic diseases 
The number of subjects with a NOCD (as assessed by the MAH) up to Month 36 was low and similar in 
the two vaccine groups (27 [4.9%] subjects in the GSK HPV vaccine group and 29 [5.2%] subjects in 
the Gardasil group). The percentage of NOCDs reported from Month 24 to Month 36 was 1.4% in each 
vaccine group. 
The most common NOCD was hypothyroidism, reported in five subjects in the GSK HPV vaccine group 
and in seven subjects in the Gardasil group. All other NOCDs were reported in at most three subjects 
in any vaccine group. The number of subjects experiencing a NOCD (as assessed by investigator) up to 
Month 36 was comparable in both vaccine groups (7.8%, 43 subjects in the GSK HPV vaccine group 
and 7.6%, 42 subjects in the Gardasil group). 
New onset autoimmune diseases 
Based on a pre-defined list of potential autoimmune events, the AEs were identified as NOCDs and 
classified as NOADs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/277891/2013  
Page 27/30 
 
 
 
 
Up to Month 36, 16 subjects experienced an event classified as a NOAD (six [1.1%] subjects in the 
GSK HPV vaccine group and ten [1.8%] subjects in the Gardasil group). No NOAD events occurred in 
the follow-up period from Month 24 to Month 36. 
The most common NOAD was hypothyroidism, reported in five subjects in each vaccine group. All 
other NOADs were reported in at most one subject in any vaccine group. 
Serious adverse events 
One subject died from a metastatic renal cell carcinoma in the follow-up period up to Month 24; this 
event was not considered to be related to vaccination by the investigator. A total of 58 subjects 
reported SAEs from Month 0 to Month 36.  
Pregnancies 
Women enrolled in the study were to be at least 3 months post-pregnancy. Additionally, women were 
to avoid pregnancy during approximately the first eight months of the study. 
During the active phase of the study, 19 pregnancies were reported (10 in GSK HPV; 9 in Gardasil).A 
total of 106 pregnancies were reported up to Month 36 (57 in the GSK HPV vaccine group and 49 in 
the Gardasil group). From Month 24 up to Month 36, 26 pregnancies were reported (16 in the GSK HPV 
vaccine group and 10 in the Gardasil group). 
2.5.3.  Discussion 
Cervarix (GSK HPV group) was more reactogenic than the Gardasil vaccine due to the higher incidence 
of solicited local and general symptoms in the 7-day postvaccination period. The difference in solicited 
symptoms was mainly observed in local rather than general symptoms, with pain as the most frequent 
local symptom. The higher reported frequency of solicited symptoms in the GSK HPV group did not 
affect compliance with vaccination, which was equivalent between groups. 
No clinically meaningful differences were identified between vaccine groups in terms of reported, 
unsolicited AEs, medically significant AEs, NOCDs, NOADs, SAEs and pregnancy outcomes. 
Up to Month 36, the percentage of subjects experiencing medically significant conditions was 43.2% in 
the GSK HPV vaccine group and 37.1% in the Gardasil group. The percentage of subjects in each 
vaccine group reporting NOCDs and NOADs up to Month 36 was comparable. A total of 30 subjects in 
the GSK HPV vaccine group and 28 subjects in the Gardasil group reported SAEs from Month 0 to 
Month 36. Pregnancies and pregnancy outcomes were comparable in both vaccine groups. 
The safety profile observed in this study for the GSK HPV vaccine is consistent with the safety profile 
observed in other studies in the HPV development. 
2.6.  Changes to the Product Information 
The MAH proposed the following changes to the Product Information (PI), to which the CHMP agreed:  
4.1 
Therapeutic indications 
Cervarix  is  a  vaccine  for  use  from  the  age  of  9  years  for  the  prevention  of  premalignant  genital 
(cervical, vulvar and vaginal) lesions and cervical cancer causally related to certain oncogenic Human 
Papillomavirus  (HPV)  types.  See  sections  4.4  and  5.1  for  important  information  on  the  data  that 
support this indication. 
Assessment report  
EMA/277891/2013  
Page 28/30 
 
 
 
 
5.1 
Pharmacodynamic properties 
Mechanism of action 
Cervarix is an adjuvanted non-infectious recombinant vaccine . . . . 
HPV-16  and  HPV-18  are  estimated  to  be  responsible  for  approximately  70%  of  cervical  cancers  and 
70% of HPV-related high grade vulvar and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia. Other oncogenic HPV types 
can  also  cause  cervical  cancer  (approximately  30%).  HPV  45,  -31  and  -33  are  the  3  most  common 
non-vaccine  HPV  types  identified  in  squamous  cervical  carcinoma  (12.1%)  and  adenocarcinoma 
(8.5%). 
The  term  “premalignant  cervical  genital  lesions”  in  section  4.1  corresponds  to  high-grade  Cervical 
Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN2/3), high-grade vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN2/3) and high-grade 
vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN2/3). 
Prophylactic efficacy against HPV-16/18 in women naïve to HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 
At end of study analysis, there were 2 cases of VIN2+ or VaIN2+ associated with HPV-16 or HPV-18 in 
the vaccine group and 7 cases in the control group in the ATP cohort.  The study was not powered to 
demonstrate a difference between the vaccine and the control group for these endpoints. 
Package Leaflet 
1. 
What Cervarix is and what it is used for 
Cervarix is a vaccine intended to protect females from the age of 9 years against the diseases caused 
by infection with Human Papillomaviruses (HPV). 
These diseases include: 
− 
cervical cancer (cancer of the cervix i.e. lower part of the uterus or womb),  
−  precancerous  cervical  lesions  of  the  female  genitals  (changes  in  cells  of  the  cervix,  vulva  and 
vagina that have a risk of turning into cancer). 
The Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types contained in the vaccine (HPV types 16 and 18) are responsible 
for approximately 70% of cervical cancer cases and 70% of HPV-related pre-cancerous lesions of the 
vulva and vagina. Other HPV types can also cause cervical cancer. Cervarix does not protect against all 
HPV types. 
In addition, changes in the Annex II regarding Pharmacovigilance system, PSUR and RMP in line with 
the latest QRD template were introduced. 
3.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
The CHMP evaluated all the available scientific evidence on Cervarix and considered the natural history 
of HPV infection, the time to disease progression, challenge animal models, and the efficacy trend 
observed in study HPV 008 acceptable and supportive to add prevention of premalignant vulvar and 
vaginal lesions related to certain oncogenic Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types to the indication.  
The current variation does not influence the known risks associated with the use of Cervarix. The 
benefit risk profile of the product remains positive.

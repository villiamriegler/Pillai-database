Update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC following completion of the paediatric studies NV25719 
and NV20234 and downstream population PK and PK/PD analysis, listed in the approved Tamiflu Paediatric 
Investigation Plan (PIP) (EMEA-000365-PIP01-08-M10).  
The study NV25719 was a prospective, open-label, randomized study, which investigated PK and PD of two 
weight adjusted oseltamivir doses for the treatment of influenza-infected immunocompromised (IC) children 
less than 13 years of age. The study NV20234 was a prospective, double blind, randomized trial, which 
investigated safety and viral resistance to oseltamivir treatment in influenza-infected IC adults, adolescents 
and children.  
The purpose of this variation is to establish a dose recommendation for the treatment of paediatric IC 
patients. 
The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
The updated RMP version 19 has also been submitted. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
In the present type II variation the MAH proposes a dosage recommendation of Tamiflu for 
immunocompromised (IC) children with influenza. SmPC, PL and labelling is proposed to be updated. 
The currently approved SmPC does not preclude use in IC subjects in any age group, but there is no 
recommended dose for IC paediatric patients. For IC adults, the recommended posology is 75 mg twice daily 
for 10 days. The MAH now proposes the posology for IC paediatric patients <18 years of age: 75 mg 
(weight-adjusted in children < 13 years of age) twice daily for 10 days. The proposed dose is the same as in 
otherwise healthy paediatric subjects, but the duration of treatment is prolonged from 5 to 10 days. 
Treatment should be initiated before 48 hours. This proposal is deemed acceptable. 
Notably, as the use of oseltamivir in IC patients is not currently excluded in Section 4.1 Indications or 
included in Section 4.3 Contraindications of the SmPC of Tamiflu, this variation concerns the evaluation of  
data defining the appropriate posology for IC children for guidance to treating physicians (in Section 4.2 
Posology and method of administration). It is to be noted, however, that the MAH does not propose to delete 
from Section 4.4 of the SmPC the text “The efficacy of oseltamivir in either treatment or prophylaxis of 
influenza in immunocompromised patients has not been firmly established.” The currently submitted data is 
not robust enough for fully filling out the gap in scientific knowledge on efficacy of oseltamivir in IC patients.

Nevertheless, the obtained data is considered sufficient for dose recommendation to be followed when 
treatment of influenza is clinically warranted for paediatric IC patients. 
Two interventional studies (NV20234 and NV25719) were carried out to establish the oseltamivir dose 
recommendation for the treatment of immunocompromised (IC) children with influenza. Study reports have 
been assessed in previous procedures (EMA/H/C/402/P46/105, EMA/H/C/402/ P46/106 and 
EMEA/H/C/000402/II/0136). Both studies compared the conventional dose of oseltamivir with higher doses. 
In study NV20234, the conventional daily dose was compared with the double dose of oseltamivir, and in 
study NV25719, the conventional daily dose was compared with a triple daily dose.  
The background conditions and concomitant medications of the study population were multiple. In study 
NV20234, patients had either primary immunodeficiency at risk for viral infections or secondary 
immunodeficiency due to solid organ transplant (SOT), haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), HIV, 
haematological malignancies or systemic immunosuppressive therapy regardless of indication. Study 
NV25719 included children (below 13 years of age) who had undergone a conditioning regimen prior to HSCT 
or less than 6 months after HSCT or received induction, consolidation, or re-intensification chemotherapy for 
haematological malignancy.  
Study NV20234 included both IC adults (>18 years old, n=207) and paediatric (1 year to <18 years old, 
n=20) patients. Study NV25719 included IC children <13 years of age (n=30). Even though enrolling infants 
was allowed by protocol, only patients above 1 year of age were finally included. There was a small number 
of patients with each different underlying IC condition. Even though the manifold background conditions 
cause large variability, it is on the other hand a benefit that the results obtained in this population can more 
easily be extrapolated to IC patients in general than would be the case if the studies had been performed in 
a uniform patient population.  
Time to clearance of viral shedding (TTCVS) and time to resolution of all symptoms (TTRAS) varied markedly 
in both studies. The observed large inter-individual variation in virological and clinical efficacy measures was 
likely due to the variable background conditions and due to chance, taking in account the small number of 
patients.  
For this reason, an extrapolation approach has been carried out using also the data sets that led to the 
original approval in OwH patients under 1 year old (Study NV25118, procedure 
EMEA/H/C/000402/II/110/G, May 2015) (see Section 8 Extrapolation of this AR). 
The extrapolation plan to determine dosing in IC children was endorsed in PIP-M10. The specific steps to 
determine dosing in immunocompromised children were: 
1)  Using  sparse  PK  data  generated  primarily  from  NV25719  together  with  any  paediatric  PK  data 
collected  from  NV20234,  if  necessary,  adapt  and  validate  the  existing  population  PK  model  in 
immunocompetent  paediatric  patients  to  describe  the  disposition  of  oseltamivir  and  OC  in 
immunocompromised children. 
2)  Use model-simulated key exposure parameters, e.g. AUC, across the range of exposures studied in 
NV25719  to  confirm  the  assumption  that  oseltamivir  and  OC  PK  does  not  differ  to  a  clinically 
important extent based solely on immune status.  
Steps 1 and 2 of the plan have been carried out adequately. The observed PK data in IC paediatric patients 
1 to ≤18 years of age were used in population PK modelling and simulations. There was a reasonable number 
(n=22) of children from one to <10 years of age in the dataset. The previously developed PK model “Healthy 
Paediatric and Young Adult Subjects” was selected as the structural model. The final model indicated that in 
IC paediatric subjects ≥ 10 years of age the apparent clearances of oseltamivir and OC were decreased by 
44.4% (95%CI: 26.8−62.0%) and 49.1% (95%CI: 34.5−63.8%), respectively, compared to OwH subjects 
Assessment report  
EMEA/H/C/000402/II/0142 
Page 7/118 
 
  
  
in the same age range, whereas in younger children (1 to <10 years) the PK of oseltamivir and OC were 
comparable in IC and OwH subjects.  
The conducted PK simulations included comparison of predicted oseltamivir and OC exposures between IC 
patients of study NV25719 and OwH patients of study WV15758, stratified by age. The results indicated that 
the predicted OC exposures in paediatric IC subjects ≥ 10 years of age were approximately 2.1−2.2 fold 
higher than in OwH subjects in the same age range. One IC patient with nephrectomy was found to be an 
outlier, having more than 2 times higher AUC compared with all other IC paediatric patients from NV25719 
study. When this outlier was excluded, the predicted OC exposures in IC patients were approximately 
1.7−1.8 fold higher than in OwH subjects. This increase in exposure is comparable with that observed in IC 
adults (see procedure EMEA/H/C/000402/II/0136) and it is not expected to be associated with safety 
problems, taking into account the known safety profile of oseltamivir. In IC subjects < 10 years of age, the 
predicted exposures were similar as in otherwise healthy subjects in the same age range.  
3)  Examine the relationship between simulated exposure parameters and observed PD measures to 
determine  if  any  PK/PD  relationship  exists.  This  relationship  could  form  the  basis  of  a  dose 
recommendation at least for children up to 13 years and potentially up to 18 years. For adolescents, 
consideration could also be given to adult data from NV20234. 
Step 3 of the plan has been carried out adequately. Relationships between predicted exposure and observed 
PD parameters (e.g. viral shedding and resolution of symptoms) were explored in 22 subjects with PK and 
PD data. No relationships between predicted exposure and viral parameters, such as time to cessation of 
viral shedding and viral titre/load measures were found. Treatment-emergent resistance developed in four 
patients with PK and PD data. There were no differences in exposures between patients that developed and 
did not develop resistance, indicating that higher than conventional dose and higher exposure to OC is not 
expected to decrease the incidence of resistance. Time to resolution of symptoms was the only parameter 
suggesting a potential benefit of a high exposure. This finding should be interpreted with caution because of 
limited number of subjects in the dataset. 
Furthermore, the collected CARIFS symptom score (in patients below 13 years of age) contains several 
items that are not specific for respiratory tract infections. CARIFS was developed in paediatric population 
that did not have underlying disease requiring daily medication and it is uncertain whether it is reliable in IC 
children. The results of exposure-response analyses for IC adults of study NV20234 did not suggest any 
relationships between predicted OC exposure and virologic PD parameters or time to resolution of clinical 
symptoms. The overall results of exposure-response analyses did not provide robust evidence to support 
benefit of higher than conventional oseltamivir dose in IC paediatric patients. This is not surprising, because 
OC trough concentrations achieved with conventional dose are above inhibitory concentrations of tested 
influenza strains.   
In studies NV20234 and NV25719, all doses (conventional, double and triple) of oseltamivir were relatively 
well tolerated. No new safety signals were observed in these studies. The nature and severity of AEs were 
consistent with established safety profile of oseltamivir. Hence, no need for amending the safety information 
in the Product Information of Tamiflu was identified.  
As the variation concerns dosage to IC paediatric patients and as multiple PIP measures are involved in the 
variation, this AR was sent for comments to the PDCO in addition to the CHMP; no comments were received 
from PDCO. The type II variation proposal concerns PIP measure 2: NV20234, PIP measure 5: NV25179; 
and PIP measure 3: Population PK modelling study (data from PIP studies 2 and 5).  
Some modifications to the proposed Product Information were requested during the variation procedure. 
The final submitted Product Information is considered acceptable.

Introduction 
Influenza is an acute respiratory infection caused by viruses of the orthomyxoviridae family. Influenza 
serotypes A and B infect humans, and are responsible for acute infection of the respiratory tract 
characterized by the sudden onset of fever, malaise, headache, myalgia, and cough. Influenza is a seasonal 
illness, with epidemic infections occurring annually during cooler months. Although difficult to assess, annual 
influenza epidemics are thought to result in between 3 and 5 million cases of severe illness and between 
250,000 and 500,000 deaths every year around the world (World Health Organization. Influenza. Fact 
Sheet. November 2018; Iuliano al. Estimates of global seasonal influenza-associated respiratory mortality: 
a modelling study. Lancet 2018; 391, 1285-1300). The clinical manifestations of influenza in paediatric 
patients are similar to those seen in adults; however, the rate of severe influenza infection is higher than in 
adults (Wong et al. Influenza-associated pediatric deaths in the United States, 2004–2012. Pediatrics. 
2013;132:796-804). Influenza can cause serious complications resulting in substantial morbidity and 
mortality, particularly in higher-risk populations such as children, the elderly, and the immunocompromised 
(IC). 
Tamiflu was initially approved in year 2002 for the treatment of influenza in adults and children one year of 
age or older and for post-exposure prevention in adults and adolescents 13 years of age or older following 
contact with a clinically diagnosed influenza case when influenza virus is circulating in the community. 
Thereafter, the indication has been several times extended due to need (especially during pandemic 
influenza) and based on studies performed during marketing of the product. Use for prevention of influenza 
in children of 1−12 years was approved in 2005 (variation II/0020), treatment of children between 6 and 12 
months of age in case of pandemic influenza in 2009 (II/0068), treatment of children between 0 and 6 
months of age and prophylaxis for children less than 1 year of age in case of pandemic influenza in 2009 
(II/0070), treatment of infants <1year without restriction to pandemic in 2015 (II/0110/G), post-exposure 
prophylaxis of children below 1 year of age during a pandemic (II/0118). Finally, specific posology for 
treatment of IC adults was approved in 2019 (II/0136), see below; the SmPC has never explicitly precluded 
use in IC patients from the indication.  
One concern has been prolonged viral shedding in IC patients treated with oseltamivir compared with 
immunocompetent patients, which has been feared to cause development of antiviral resistance against 
neuraminidase inhibitors.  Some clinical practice guidelines have proposed a double-dose regimen of 
oseltamivir for 10 days in IC population (Manuel et al. Influenza and other respiratory virus infections in solid 
organ transplant recipients. Clin Microbiol Infect. 2014;20 Suppl 7:102-108., Engelhard et al. European 
guidelines for prevention and management of influenza in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and 
leukemia patients: summary of ECIL-4 (2011), on behalf of ECIL, a joint venture of EBMT, EORTC, ICHS, and 
ELN Transpl Infect Dis. 2013;15:219-232). Data from observational studies indicate that this approach is 
widely used (Watcharananan et al. Influenza A/H1N1 2009 pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients: 
characteristics and outcomes following high-dose oseltamivir exposure. Transpl Infect Dis. 
2010;12:127-131; Kumar et al. Outcomes from pandemic influenza A H1N1 infection in recipients of 
solid-organ transplants: a multicentre cohort study. Lancet Infect Dis. 2010;10:521-526). However, only 
limited observational and retrospective evidence have supported these recommendations. 
The requirement for the MAH to evaluate the use of oseltamivir for treatment and prophylaxis in 
immunocompromised (IC) patients was originally issued in 2002 with Follow-up Measure (FUM) 8 
(subsequently as FUM-008.5), which later became post-approval measures MEA 75 and MEA 102. Studies 
NV20234 and NV20235 were designed to evaluate the treatment and prophylaxis of IC patients respectively, 
and were agreed as appropriate to address FUM-008.5 by the CHMP in November 2006. Study NV20235 for

the prophylaxis of influenza with oseltamivir was completed in June 2008 and the data added to the EU 
SmPC. 
In 2010 (II/0069) it was added in the SmPC of Tamiflu that the efficacy of oseltamivir in IC population 
remains uncertain, as two studies conducted in IC patients failed to show significant benefit in seasonal  
prophylaxis with oseltamivir. These comprised 1) a  prospective, randomised, double-blind, stratified (by 
transplant type, vaccination status, and age), multicentre trial of oseltamivir versus placebo for seasonal 
influenza prophylaxis for 12 weeks in IC adults and children aged above one year (NV20235); and 2) a 
prospective, non-randomised, open-label multicentre study to evaluate the safety of oseltamivir for 
seasonal influenza prophylaxis for 6 weeks in 52 children (1 to 12 years of age) considered at risk for 
infection or having susceptible individuals in their household (NV20236). However, safety of oseltamivir in 
the long-term administration was consistent with the known safety profile of oseltamivir. 
The increased morbidity of influenza in IC patients is associated with increased viral load and increased 
duration of virus shedding compared to that in healthy patients. Therefore, a key objective of anti-viral 
therapy in this population is to reduce the duration of viral shedding, which in turn should reduce influenza 
-associated morbidity. It has been demonstrated earlier that paediatric patients and immunocompromised 
population are susceptible to prolonged viral shedding and post-baseline viral resistance. The previous 
MAH-sponsored data on this issue is briefly reviewed below. 
• 
The Influenza Resistance Information Study (IRIS, NV20237) was set up by the MAH in response to 
the emergence of naturally occurring neuraminidase resistance among seasonal influenza H1N1 
viruses in 2008. The study enrolled 4553 patients from year 2008 to 2015, of whom 2578 were 
treated with oseltamivir either alone or combined with other antiviral medication(s). Over the first 5 
years, patients of any age were eligible for enrolment. In years 6 and 7 of the study, recruitment was 
focused on children aged <12 years, since results of the first 5 years had indicated that this group 
had higher rates of resistance than adults and adolescents. The cumulative resistance rate against 
influenza A (H1N1pdm09 and H3N2 viruses combined) was 3.5%. Incidence of treatment-emergent 
resistance increased with decreasing age: 1.1% in adults and adolescents, 1.6% in children aged 
6-12 years, 8.0% in children aged 1–5 years and 20.0% in infants aged <1 (although only 20 
patients were assessed in this age group). Incidence of treatment-emergent resistance varied 
yearly. Children who were found to carry oseltamivir-resistant virus in general shed the virus for a 
prolonged period compared with subjects with susceptible virus. However, treatment-emergent 
resistance to oseltamivir did not affect treatment response and caused no prolongation of influenza 
symptoms. The results of IRIS were implemented in the PI of Tamiflu in variation II-122.  
•  During the variation II-122, the MAH submitted upon request an integrated analysis of viral 
resistance from all MAH-sponsored clinical trials with resistance data. The integrated analysis pooled 
data from 6/11 studies, as phenotypic and genotypic resistance was not available in all studies. The 
incidence of adult and adolescent patients found to carry oseltamivir-resistant virus was 0.62% 
(14/2253) by phenotyping alone and 0.67% (15/2253) by genotyping and phenotyping. For children 
aged 1-12 years the updated incidence was 3.89% (66/1698) by phenotyping and 4.24% (72/1698) 
by genotyping and phenotyping. For infants aged less than 1 year the resistance incidence was 
18.31% (13/71) both by phenotyping alone and by a combination of genotyping and phenotyping. 
•  During years 4 and 5 of IRIS, a substudy was introduced to collect data in patients who were 
immunocompromised. The results of this sub-study were assessed separately (MEA 075.11-CHMP 
outcome 2 July 2014).  In the substudy, 42 hospitalised IC patients aged from 1 to 73 years were 
recruited, of whom 29 were influenza-positive by RT-PCR. 25/29 had Influenza A, subtypes 
H1N1pdm09 (n= 15), H3N2 (n=14), mixed H1N1pdm09+H3N2 (n=1), and 4 had influenza B. No 
resistant viruses were detected at baseline. The H275Y resistance mutation was detected in 
post-Day-1 samples from 4 adult patients infected with H1N1pdm09 viruses who received

oseltamivir. No other resistance mutations were detected. Two patients with influenza A had 
prolonged viral shedding up to 15 days; one with H1N1pdm09 (H275Y mutant strain) and one with 
H3N2 (no antiviral resistance). 
The purpose of the current variation is to establish a dose recommendation for the treatment of paediatric 
immunocompromised (IC) patients, who are currently not excluded from the indication, but for whom no 
prior recommendation of dosage exists in the PI of Tamiflu. The MAH is proposing update of sections 4.2, 
4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC, and to update the PL accordingly.   
The dosing recommendation for IC paediatric patients aged below 18 years is mainly based on 
pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), PK/PD evaluation and disease modelling analysis in addition 
to observed resistance, efficacy and safety (see section 6 Clinical Pharmacology aspects of this AR). The key 
PK, PD, PK/PD and disease modelling results are derived from the following analyses conducted by the MAH:

The report contains population PK analyses to 1) establish a predictive population model that describes 
the PK of OP and OC following multi-dose oral administration in IC paediatric patients from birth to less than 
18 years of age for the treatment of influenza; and 2) to estimate individual OP and OC steady-state 
exposures (AUC0-12, Cmax, Ctrough) in paediatric IC patients from studies NV20234 and NV25719 for the 
treatment of influenza; and exposure-response (ER) analyses to explore relationships between OP and 
OC systemic exposure and the pharmacodynamic endpoints on the viral and clinical course of influenza in 
these patients.

Oseltamivir (Tamiflu®) in the Treatment of Immunocompromised Pediatric Patients (< 
18 Years) with Influenza. Report number: 1093513, May 31, 2019. 
The purpose of the analysis was to characterize the kinetics of naturally occurring influenza infections and 
the treatment effect of oseltamivir in IC paediatric subjects. Data for the analyses comprised of 166 IC 
patients from study NV20234 (150 adult patients aged ≥18 years and 16 paediatric patients aged<18 
years), 20 paediatric IC patients below 13 years from study NV25719, and 6 IC patients (aged 13 to 69 
years) from study NV25118. 
The studies used as source data for the above-mentioned analyses and prior regulatory procedures based on 
the studies are briefly described below. 
Study NV20234 was originally designed to compare the efficacy of the conventional and double daily dose 
of oseltamivir administered for 10 days (double the conventional duration) in IC patients. However, due to 
recruitment problems, the power of the study was not expected to be sufficient for the original efficacy 
endpoint, and the primary endpoint was changed into investigation of safety and resistance profile of these 
two regimens. This study was initiated in 2007 and incorporated into the initial oseltamivir Paediatric 
Investigation Plan (PIP) on 02 October 2009 [measure 2 of current PIP]. The NV20234 study was a Phase III, 
double blind, randomized, stratified, multicentre study of conventional and double dose oseltamivir for the 
treatment of influenza in IC patients. Study NV20234 enrolled mainly adults (≥18 years of age) patients, 
although some paediatric patients were also enrolled (see Section 7.1 of this AR).  
The final primary objective of study NV20234 was to evaluate prospectively the safety and tolerability of 
oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza in IC patients (adults and paediatric patients) and characterize the

effects of oseltamivir in IC patients on the development of resistant influenza virus. Secondary objectives 
evaluated the effects of conventional and double dose of oseltamivir on the population pharmacokinetics 
(PK) of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) in IC patients with confirmed influenza infection, 
through the application of established population pharmacokinetic (PK) models to the sparse plasma 
concentration data generated; the virologic course of influenza (proportion shedding and viral loads at 
different timepoints; the time to resolution of influenza symptoms; the clinical course of influenza (fever, 
symptoms, secondary illnesses as evidenced by otitis media, bronchitis, pneumonia, or sinusitis), and to 
explore the relationship of metrics of exposure (e.g., area under the concentration-time curve [AUC], trough 
plasma concentration [Cmin]) to relevant pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoints. 
The target population for study NV20234 were patients with primary immunodeficiency at risk for viral 
infections or secondary immunodeficiency due to ongoing immunosuppression due to solid organ transplant 
(SOT), allogenic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) or human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] 
infection with CD4 count <500/mm3 (or <25% in children < 5 years old), haematological malignancies or 
systemic immunosuppressive therapy. 
The dose recommendation for adult IC patients was implemented in the Product Information (PI) in 
January 2019 [Type II variation procedure No. EMEA/H/C/000402/II/0136 
(EMA/CHMP/PRAC/487212/2018)].  The variation was based on the results on adult IC patients in study 
NV20234; a population PK analysis utilising data from IC patients (study NV20234) and otherwise healthy 
(OwH) patients (study NV25118); and an Influenza disease PK/VK model.  The conclusion was that the 
double dose (150 mg BID) was not more efficacious than the standard dose (75 mg BID) in adult IC patients. 
There was no difference in incidence of secondary illnesses or hospitalisations. Adult IC patients treated with 
standard dose (75 mg BID) had mean steady-state OC levels comparable to OwH subjects treated with 150 
mg BID, which was attributed to background conditions and to lower estimated creatinine clearance in the IC 
population. Treatment emergent resistance was more likely in the conventional compared with the 
double-dose group in IC adults; and when resistance was present, the time to cessation of viral shedding 
was prolonged. However, the number of adult patients with oseltamivir-resistant influenza was small: 10/73 
patients in the conventional dose group and 2/78 in the double-dose group. Previous data, including the IRIS 
(Influenza Resistance Information Study) in 3725 immunocompetent patients, include no reports of further 
transmission of oseltamivir resistant viruses from a case with treatment-emergent oseltamivir resistance. As 
no clinical benefit was observed with double daily dose in IC adults, the daily dose of oseltamivir for adult IC 
subjects was accepted to be the conventional 75 mg BID. The duration of oseltamivir treatment in NV20234 
was 10 days in both study arms (conventional and double dose). Modelling results suggested that with a 
5-day treatment regimen of 75 mg BID there is a risk of viral re-growth, which can be reduced using a 
10-day treatment regimen of 75 mg BID, therefore, the approved duration of treatment with oseltamivir in 
IC adults was accepted to be 10 days instead of the conventional 5 days. It was also noted that the time to 
resolution of all symptoms was markedly better in patients who were administered oseltamivir within 48 
hours from onset of symptoms (69.0 hours, 95% CI: 44.4, 103.4) vs. 122.7 hours, 95% CI: 57.1, 169.0) in 
subjects who received oseltamivir >48 hours after onset of symptoms; although the 95% CIs overlapped. 
Study NV25719 [measure 5 of PIP] and downstream population PK and PK/PD model [measure 3 of PIP] 
were intended to guide in appropriate posology of oseltamivir in the treatment of influenza in 
immunocompromised children less than 13 years of age with confirmed influenza infection. The final study 
report of NV25719 was assessed and accepted in the procedure no. EMA/H/C/402/P46/106 (April 2019). 
That procedure did not involve update of PI regarding dosage of oseltamivir for IC children, as the currently 
submitted results of the population PK and influenza disease modelling reports were awaited for that 
purpose. 
The objectives of the study NV25719 were to generate data for the purpose of extrapolation of efficacy from 
adults with immunodeficiency and to compare and/or integrate exposure and response observations in the 
paediatric IC population to that seen in other, non-IC populations; to estimate the exposure achieved with

each of different dose levels of oseltamivir through the application of an established population PK (popPK) 
model to the sparse concentration data generated; and to examine the duration of treatment, of viral 
shedding, and of fever and to examine the safety, tolerability, incidence of influenza-associated 
complications and of resistance observed with different doses and duration of treatment and characterize 
any resistant virus isolate in terms of sequence and phenotype. 
Study NV25719 recruited paediatric IC patients less than 13 years of age with a laboratory-confirmed 
diagnosis of influenza who were receiving induction, consolidation, or reintensification chemotherapy for a 
haematological malignancy or were undergoing a conditioning regimen either prior to hematopoietic stem 
cell transplant (HSCT) or less than 6 months after HSCT. The manifold background conditions of the subjects 
caused large variation in the viral and clinical outcome measures. On the other hand, the variability of the 
studied population supports generalisation of the obtained results in paediatric IC patients regardless of the 
reason for compromised immune response.  
The duration of treatment tested in study NV20234 was 10 days. In study NV25719, the duration of 
treatment was adaptive and depended on clearance of viral shedding: mean duration of exposure to 
oseltamivir was 9.2 days (range: 4 to 19 days) in the conventional dose group and 8.5 days (range: 2 to 19 
days) in the triple dose group.  
Study NV25118 was a multicentre study of the safety of oseltamivir administered intravenously for the 
treatment of influenza in patients aged ≥13 years, conducted over 3 influenza seasons (2009/2010, 
2010/2011 and 2011/2012). The study was initiated as the emergence of the pandemic (H1N1)2009 virus, 
created an urgent unmet medical need for an intravenous (IV) neuraminidase inhibitor to treat seasonal and 
pandemic influenza in critically ill patients and others unable to tolerate, swallow or absorb orally 
administered medications. Investigational product in this study was oseltamivir phosphate lyophilisate to be 
prepared for IV infusion; additionally oral capsule were used to complete the treatment course. The 
development of the IV formulation however was discontinued, and the IV compassionate use program was 
closed down as the requests to participate declined since the pandemic. Study NV25118 was therefore 
terminated early. The CSR of this study was assessed in 2013 (EMEA/H/K/002287). Of the 118 patients in 
NV25118, 6 were PD-evaluable IC patients (≥13 years of age), and their data has been used in the viral 
kinetics modelling and simulation analysis performed by the MAH for the current variation.  
The results on the paediatric patients included in studies NV20234 and NV25719 are included and discussed 
in this AR in the extent that is considered relevant for the current variation, even though the CSRs for these 
studies were assessed previously.  
In paediatric drug development, extrapolation is frequently used to address uncertainties due to gaps in 
knowledge (Reflection paper on the use of extrapolation in the development of medicines for paediatrics. 7 
October 2018. EMA/189724/2018). E.g., the extension of use of oseltamivir in the treatment of influenza in 
infants below 1 year of age (II/0110/G) was  based on extrapolation of efficacy from adults and older 
children and PK/PD modelling from studies CASG114 (children with influenza aged < 2 years) and WP22849 
(infants with influenza <1 year of age). Due to the small number of subjects in the clinical studies on IC 
children, the recommended dosage cannot be based on robust efficacy data in this population. Therefore, 
extrapolation is needed from otherwise healthy (OwH) children and from IC adults. 
The MAHs extrapolation plan as presented to the Paediatric committee of  EMA (PDCO) during the most 
recent modification procedure  (EMEA-000365-PIP01-08-M10, 29 June 2018) consists of data from 
immunocompetent and immunocompromised adults, immunocompetent and IC paediatric patients, and 
modelling and simulation (see section 8 Extrapolation of this AR). As use of oseltamivir in 
immunocompromised patients is not currently excluded in Section 4.1 Indications or included in Section 4.3

Contraindications of the SmPC of Tamiflu, this variation is not an extension of indication, but concerns 
evaluation of the data for defining appropriate posology for IC children for guidance to treating physicians (in 
Section 4.2 Posology and method of administration). It is to be noted, however, that the MAH does not 
propose to delete from Section 4.4 of the SmPC the text “The efficacy of oseltamivir in either treatment or 
prophylaxis of influenza in immunocompromised patients has not been firmly established.” The currently 
submitted data is not robust enough for filling out the gap in scientific knowledge on efficacy of oseltamivir 
in IC patients. Nevertheless, the obtained data is considered sufficient for dose recommendation to be 
followed when treatment of influenza is clinically warranted for paediatric IC patients. 
In addition to the above-described modelling reports and the resubmitted CSRs for the clinical studies 
providing source data for the modelling, the MAH has submitted a Clinical overview, Clinical summary 
(Summary of clinical efficacy, Summary of clinical safety, Summary of clinical pharmacology), literature 
references with 65 references, synopses of individual studies and Risk Management Plan (RMP version 19.). 
5.  Clinical Pharmacology aspects 
Introduction 
The active moiety of Tamiflu is the pro-drug oseltamivir (as oseltamivir phosphate). Oseltamivir is readily 
absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration and is extensively converted by hepatic 
carboxyl-esterase 1 to the active metabolite oseltamivir carboxylate (OC). At least 75% of an  oral  dose 
reaches the systemic circulation as active metabolite. Exposure to oseltamivir (in terms of AUC) is less than 
5% of the exposure to OC. Plasma concentrations of both oseltamivir and OC are proportional to dose. 
The volume of distribution of intravenously dosed OC is approximately 23 to 26 litres (~0.3 l/kg) in healthy 
adults. The binding of OC to human plasma proteins is negligible (approximately 3%). 
Absorbed oseltamivir is primarily (>90%) eliminated by conversion to OC, which is not further metabolised. 
OC is eliminated by renal excretion (glomerular filtration and tubular secretion). Clearance of intravenously 
dosed  OC  is  approximately  20  l/h  in  healthy  adults.  Elimination  half-life  (t½)  of  OC  after  oral  dosing  of 
oseltamivir is approximately 6 to 10 hours in adults with normal renal function. This is significantly longer 
than the t½ of intravenously administered OC (approximately 1 to 2 hours), which indicates that release of 
OC from the liver is the rate-limiting step in the elimination of OC after oral administration of oseltamivir.  
Pharmacokinetic  (PK)  and  pharmacodynamic  (PD)  properties  of  the  pro-drug  oseltamivir  and  the  active 
metabolite  oseltamivir  carboxylate  are  established.  The  new  clinical  pharmacology  data  supporting  the 
current application are oseltamivir and OC concentrations and viral/clinical PD data for immunocompromised 
(IC) paediatric subjects in studies NV25719 and NV20234 (Figure 5.1.1) and subsequent population PK and 
exposure-response modelling and simulations. A disease model (viral kinetics modelling and simulation) is 
also presented.

5.1 Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Bioanalytics 
Plasma concentrations of oseltamivir (RO0640796) and oseltamivir carboxylate (RO0640802) were 
determined in human EDTA plasma according to the validated LC-MS/MS method (PRA-US-0017). 
Quantification was accomplished by means of the internal standard method using isotopically labelled 
internal standards for both oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate. The method employed protein 
precipitation for sample preparation and gradient elution on HPLC followed by mass spectrometric detection. 
The bioanalytical method of study NV20234 has been previously assessed in the procedure 
EMEA/H/C/000402/II/0136. The assessment of bioanalytical methods used in study NV25719 is shown 
below. 
Bioanalytics of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate (Study NV25719) 
Plasma concentrations of oseltamivir (RO0640796) and oseltamivir carboxylate were determined in human 
EDTA plasma according to the validated LC-MS/MS method (RPU664UL-116647-B). Quantification was 
accomplished by means of the internal standard method using isotopically labelled internal standards for 
both oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate. The method employed protein precipitation for sample 
preparation and gradient elution on HPLC followed by mass spectrometric detection.

The human plasma samples were collected in tubes containing K3-EDTA. The samples were initially stored at 
-20°C, but were later relocated to −70°C on 16-May-2018 according to the Study Plan Amendment No. 01. 
The calibration standards and quality control (QC) samples were prepared in K2-EDTA. 
The total number of received samples was 108 and concentrations of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate 
were successfully determined in all 108 samples within the documented long-term stability of 1197 days at 
−70 °C and 1014 days at −20 °C.  
Tandem mass spectrometric detection was applied using a mass spectrometer operating in positive ion 
mode with electrospray ionization. The data was collected using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). The 
selected transitions (m/z) were 313.1 → 166.0 for oseltamivir, 285.1 → 138.0 for oseltamivir carboxylate, 
316.2 → 167.2 for oseltamivir internal standard (RO0640796-d3) and, 288.2 → 139.1 for oseltamivir 
carboxylate internal standard (RO0640802-d3).  Quantification was accomplished by using internal standard 
method. 
The calibration standards were prepared in human K2-EDTA plasma. Eight different concentrations of 
calibration standards were included ranging from 1.00 ng/ml to 500 ng/ml for RO0640796 and 10.0 ng/ml 
to 5000 ng/ml for RO0640802. The calibration curves were established by weighted (1/x2) linear regression 
from peak area ratios (peak area of analyte/peak area of internal standard) versus nominal concentrations. 
The back calculated concentrations of the calibration standards and the calibration curve parameters are 
presented. 
The performance of sample analysis was monitored by quality control (QC) samples in K2-EDTA plasma 
spiked with 3 different concentrations of the analytes, 3.00, 50.00 and 400 ng/ml for RO0640796 and 30.0, 
500 and 4000 ng/ml for RO0640802. The individual results for the QC samples including the corresponding 
precision and accuracy data are presented. 
In each analytical run, a blank sample and a zero sample were analysed to assess the selectivity of the 
analytical method. Selectivity was acceptable if the response of co-eluting peaks (peak area) did not exceed 
20.0% of the peak response at the LLOQ level of the analyte and did not exceed 5.0% of the peak response 
(peak area) of the internal standard found in the sample at the LLOQ level analysed in the same run.  
In run AN-11, two blanks had peaks > LLOQ for both analytes, 716% and 241% for RO0640796, and 692% 
and 206% for RO0640802. Results were not consistent with carryover but rather attributed to isolated 
interfering peaks. The run was rejected for both analytes out of precaution and the samples were 
reanalysed.  
A total of 3 samples for RO0640796 and 2 samples for RO0640802 were reanalysed for analytical reasons. 
For RO0640796, 2 original results were not reportable due to abnormal internal standard response and 1 
original result was not reportable due to out of range concentration (>500 ng/mL) where the sample was 
reanalysed after dilution. For RO0640802, the original results were not reportable for 2 samples due to 
abnormal internal standard response. 
Dilution integrity (10-fold) was evaluated. 
Incurred sample reanalysis (ISR) was done for a total of 15 study samples. Three of the ISR samples for 
RO0640796 showed variability greater than 20%. None of the ISR samples for RO0640802 had variability 
greater than 20%. 
Representative chromatograms of blank, zero, calibration, QC and study samples are presented.

Assessor’s comments on bioanalytics 
The  bioanalytical  method  used  to  quantitate  oseltamivir  (RO0640796)  and  oseltamivir  carboxylate 
(RO0640802)  has  been  validated  according  to  the  Guideline  on  bioanalytical  method  validation 
(EMEA/CHPM/EWP/192217/2009  Rev.1).  The  current  submission  did  not  contain  the  validation  report. 
However,  the  validation  report  including  the  amendments  01  and  02  has  been  provided  earlier.    The 
validation is considered acceptable.   
The samples were originally stored at −20 °C and later (16 May 2018) moved to −70 °C. The stability results 
presented in Amendment 02 to the validation report (Table 17 of the Amendment 2, not shown in this AR) 
show that oseltamivir is stable up to 1197 days at −70 °C but not at −20 °C. It is stated in the bioanalytical 
report that the samples were analysed within the documented stability of 1197 days at −70 °C and 1014 
days at −20 °C. Maximum storage time of the samples at −20 °C before analysis has not been stated but it 
appears to be significantly shorter than the documented stability of 1014 days.  
Tables of all analytical runs are included in the report. The back-calculated concentrations of the calibration 
standards and calibration curve parameters of acceptable runs are presented and they are acceptable.  
The criteria for selectivity was met and the bioanalytical results were not affected by carry-over. 
The individual results for the QC samples including the corresponding precision and accuracy data have been 
presented. One QC sample result for RO0640802 was outside the acceptance criteria but was included in 
statistical evaluation. The intra-assay precision of QC samples ranged from 2.9% to 5.5% for RO0640796 
and from 2.7% to 6.8% for RO0640802. There was no marked inaccuracy in the results of QC samples. 
Reanalysis of the samples has been discussed adequately.  
The results of incurred samples reanalysis are acceptable. 
Population Pharmacokinetic and Exposure-Response Analyses 
Population  PK  and  exposure-response  (ER)  analyses  (Report  Number  1093512;  May  27,  2019)  were 
performed to describe the PK characteristics of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) in IC patients 
following oral administration of oseltamivir.  
Population PK model 
The objectives of the population PK analysis were: 
• 
To establish a predictive population model that describes the pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir and 
OC following multi-dose oral administration in immunocompromised paediatric patients from birth 
to less than 18 years of age for the treatment of influenza; 
• 
To  estimate  individual  oseltamivir  and  OC  steady-state  exposures  (AUC0-12,  Cmax,  Ctrough)  in 
paediatric IC patients from studies NV20234 and NV25719 for the treatment of influenza. 
The data available for the current population PK analysis were limited (sparse sampling from 30 subjects). 
Therefore, new PK model was not developed. Instead, two previously developed population PK models were 
tested  with  model  parameters  fixed  to  prior  estimates,  and  study  effect  parameters  were  added  to 
oseltamivir  and  OC  apparent  clearances  to  account  for  differences  between  paediatric  IC  patients  and 
otherwise healthy (OwH) subjects. The models are summarised below.

Model in Healthy Paediatric and Young Adult Subjects (Prior Model 1) 
The  model  in  healthy  paediatric  and  young  adult  subjects  (Ravva  et  al.  Mechanistic  Population 
Pharmacokinetics of Oseltamivir in neonates to young adult patients with normal renal function, Abstract 
T-59, American Conference on Pharmacometrics 7, 2016.), further called Prior Model 1, was developed to 
assess  the  effects  of  renal  and  hepatic  maturation  in  this  population.  The  model  was  developed  using 
oseltamivir (3100 samples) and OC (3560 samples) concentration-time data following oseltamivir oral and 
IV administration in 313 paediatric subjects and 123 young adult subjects (≤40 years) with normal renal 
function (creatinine clearance > 90 ml/min). The model has been assessed by the CHMP in the procedure 
EMEA/H/C/000402/II/0118  (Scope:  to  update  the  pharmacokinetic  information  to  include  information 
regarding use in post-exposure prophylaxis of children below 1 year of age during a pandemic).  
Model structure and parameters are  presented  in Figure  5.1.2  and Table  5.1.1,  respectively. The  model 
takes developmental physiological changes into account.

Paediatrics through Geriatrics Population PK Model (Prior Model 2) 
Paediatrics through geriatrics model (further called Prior Model 2) describes oseltamivir PK in healthy 
subjects and subjects with renal impairment, in paediatric and adult subjects of all ages. This model uses 
calculated creatinine clearance (CRCL) as a covariate, but a non-standard way of computing CRCL was used 
during development of this model (refer to Kamal et al. Population pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir: 
paediatrics through geriatrics. Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2013;57(8):3470–3477). Therefore, two

versions of the model were evaluated, with CRCL computed using the original way (Kamal et al. 2013) and 
by the modified Schwartz equations in paediatric subjects: 
•  CRCL = 0.45 * HTCM [Height (cm)]/SCR [serum creatinine; mg/dL)] if Age ≤ 1 year; 
•  CRCL = 0.55*HTCM/SCR (mg/dL) if Age >1 and ≤ 17 years. 
Model structure and parameters (from Kamal et al. 2013) are presented in Figure 5.1.3 and Table 5.1.2, 
respectively.

Table 5.1.2. Oseltamivir and OC population PK model parameter estimatesa (Prior Model 2) 
The two models described above were first tested with all parameters fixed to the prior values. Then, 
additional effects of immunocompromised status (implemented as the multiplicative study effects) on 
oseltamivir and OC clearance parameters (CL and CLM, respectively) were added and estimated while the 
rest of the parameters remained fixed. 
Diagnostic plots and the objective function value were used for comparison of the models. The ability of the 
model to predict the exposure was characterized by its ability to predict individual values of OC AUC (that are 
inversely proportional to OC clearance). Therefore, standard deviation of inter-individual error on CLM 
(CV=sd(ηi CLM)) that characterizes the discrepancy between the population and individual predictions of CLM 
was computed and used as an additional measure of goodness of fit (as OC clearance is not dependent on the 
dose). Finally, model performance was verified with visual predictive check (VPC) plots and normalized 
prediction distribution errors (NPDE) plots. 
The population PK analysis was conducted via nonlinear mixed-effects modelling with the NONMEM 
software, Version 7.4.3. The first-order conditional estimation with INTERACTION option (FOCEI) method in 
NONMEM was employed for all model runs. Model-based simulations were performed by a combination of R 
(version 3.5.1) and NONMEM software.

The selected final population PK model was used to estimate the individual PK parameters and exposures. 
Specifically, steady-state Cmax, Ctrough, and AUCτ, were computed for oseltamivir and OC following nominal 
BID dosing regimen for each subject. AUCτ and Ctrough values were computed over the 12-hr period. The 
summaries of individual PK parameters and exposure estimates (mean, standard deviation [SD], geometric 
mean, coefficient of variation [CV], median and range) were computed by dosing group and study. 
Individual estimates of exposure were used in exposure-response analyses. 
Furthermore, individual exposure estimates for IC adult subjects were used to compare IC effects in adult 
and paediatric populations. The model for immunocompromised adult subjects was previously selected in 
procedure EMEA/H/C/000402/II/0136 (scope: to guide prescribers on the use of Tamiflu for treatment in 
immunocompromised adult patients).  
Exposure-response analyses 
Exposure-response (ER) relationships were investigated in 22 IC paediatric patients who had both PK and PD 
data.  Predicted oseltamivir carboxylate steady-state exposure measures (Cmin,OC and AUC12,OC) were highly 
correlated (R=0.989), therefore, only predicted OC trough concentration (Cmin,OC) was used for the ER 
analyses.  
Time-to-Event analyses. The following time-to-event endpoints were investigated: 
• 
Time to cessation of viral shedding by culture [TTCVSCUL] and by reverse-transcription polymerase 
chain reaction (RT-PCR) [TTCVSPCR] 
• 
Time to resolution of influenza symptoms (including fever) (TTRS) and of fever (TTRF) 
Two analyses were performed for each time-to-event endpoint. In the first analysis, subjects were divided in 
two exposure categories (defined by the median value of exposure) and Kaplan-Meier plots were 
constructed for each of the two exposure categories. In the second analysis, ER relationships were described 
by semi-parametric Cox proportional hazards (CPH) models that aimed to evaluate the effect of exposure on 
the probability of events. The hazard function in the CPH model is expressed as: 
where λ0(t) is the baseline hazard function and Χi is a vector of predictor variables that included continuous 
exposure (Cmin,OC or natural logarithm of Cmin,OC) or exposure category (defined by median of Cmin,OC). The 
parameter vector β was estimated by maximum partial-likelihood. 
Analyses of Viral Titre/Load Measures. A linear regression model was implemented to assess the correlation 
between each viral titre/load measure [AUC of the viral load for RT-PCR (PCRAUCVT); AUC of the viral titre 
for culture (CULAUCVT); Peak viral load for RT-PCR (PCRPVT); Peak viral titre for culture (CULPVT)] with 
exposure (Cmin,OC and logCmin,OC). To define confidence interval for the linear regression function, 1000 
bootstrap samples were drawn with replacement from the analysis population, and linear regression was 
fitted to each of these samples.  
Analyses of Treatment-Emergent Resistance. Logistic regression models were implemented to assess the 
correlation of the probability of treatment-emergent genotypic or phenotypic resistance with exposure. To 
define confidence interval for the logistic regression function, 1000 bootstrap samples were drawn with 
replacement from the analysis population, and the logistic regression was fitted to each of these samples. 
Disease modelling 
A mechanistic viral kinetic model was developed for IC paediatric and adult patients receiving treatment with 
oseltamivir based on a drug-disease model previously developed for immunocompromised adult patients 
(procedure EMEA/H/C/000402/II/0136), which was based on a published 3-compartment model

representing uninfected target epithelial cells (T), infected cells (I) and pool of free virus (V) [Baccam et al.. 
J Virol. 2006; 80(15): 7590–9; Kamal et al. Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2015; 59(9): 5388–95]. The 
model structure is summarised in Figure 5.1.4. 
Figure 5.1.4. Structure of the influenza viral kinetic and drug inhibition model. 
The key objectives of the disease modelling analysis were: 
• 
Extend a viral kinetic model developed from longitudinal viral load data and oseltamivir carboxylate 
exposures in immunocompromised adult patients to immunocompromised paediatric patients to 
characterize the viral kinetics of influenza following oseltamivir dosing. 
• 
Exploration of biologically relevant covariates that may explain inter-individual variability and 
antiviral treatment effect. 
• 
Identification and characterization of potential population differences impacting the influenza 
kinetics and oseltamivir effects between adult (≥ 18 years) and paediatric(< 18 years) 
immunocompromised subjects 
• 
To simulate the effects of oseltamivir dose regimens in the immunocompromised paediatric 
population to characterize the impact of dose, time from symptom onset to treatment initiation, and 
the duration of treatment post-infection on viral kinetics 
The viral kinetics of this model are described by the following differential equations: 
Assessment report

where a pool of target respiratory epithelial cells (T) are infected by a pool of free virus (V) described by a 
second-order rate constant (β). Infected cells (I) shed virus at a production rate (p). Free virus is cleared by 
rate (c), and infected cells are cleared by rate (δ). 
The antiviral effect of oseltamivir was modelled according to its known mechanism of action for p inhibition, 
and was described by: 
where AUC is the area under the concentration-time curve for oseltamivir within a dosing interval at steady 
state; AUC50 is the exposure at half-maximal inhibition and pNT is the rate of free virus production in the 
absence of drug inhibition. The inhibition effect is set to zero (i.e. INH = 0) during the absence of treatment 
(pre- or post-treatment). 
Model assumptions included: 
•  The initial amount of uninfected target epithelial cells (T0) was assumed as 4 x 108 cells, based on 
known respiratory physiology in healthy human adults. There was no replenishment of dead cells. 
•  The initial conditions for infected cells (I0) and free virus (V0) were assumed as 0 cells and 1 vp/mL, 
respectively. For free virus, a positive viral load (but BLQ) was required for initialization and model 
stability. An initial condition of 1 vp/mL for V0 was therefore arbitrarily assumed. 
•  The time of viral infection was assumed to occur at 36 hours prior to symptom onset. 
•  Drug inhibition was driven by post-hoc individual estimates for the AUC of oseltamivir carboxylate 
that were derived from the population PK model. The inhibition effect was implemented only for the 
treatment duration, and was negated before and after the dosing period. Thus, in the absence of 
treatment, the rate of viral production is defined by pNT (where INH = 0). 
Data manipulation, visualization, and simulations were conducted using version 3.5 of R. Population viral 
kinetics analyses were conducted via nonlinear mixed effects modelling with the NONMEM software, Version 
7.4. Missing post-baseline genotypic and phenotypic resistance covariate values were imputed to be 
non-resistant, the most common value. Given the large number (618 of 1202; 51.4%) of viral load 
observations below the limit of quantification (BLQ), the Beal "M3" method was applied.  
The base structural model (Figure 5.1.4.) was implemented in Monolix during the previous (IC adult) 
modelling effort. The initial conditions, population time since infection estimate, and parameter estimates 
from the previous IC adult analysis were used as the initial conditions and initial parameter estimates for 
translation into NONMEM. The Bayesian estimation method in NONMEM (METHOD=BAYES) with ADVAN13 
and TOL=9 was used. Random effects (ETAs) were placed on parameters β, δ, pNT, AUC50, and c, and a 
Assessment report

proportional log-additive error model was implemented, modelled as a SIGMA-like THETA. Random effect 
covariances were set to 0 to maintain consistency with the original IC adult modelling work. 
Following implementation of the initial base structural model in NONMEM, extension to the paediatric 
population was explored. Paediatric population scaling was examined for potential inclusion on the free virus 
and infected cell clearance rate parameters (c and δ, respectively) to account for potential differences in 
immune response between IC adults and IC paediatric patients. Population covariate (paediatric vs. adult) 
on viral production rate and infection rate was not considered, as these parameters are inherent to viral 
strains and not expected to differ between patient populations. 
The final IC adult and paediatric viral kinetics model was used to simulate oseltamivir treatment scenarios of 
interest. For each treatment arm in these scenarios, 500 simulated trials, each with 250 IC adult and 250 IC 
paediatric patients were conducted. For each trial and each patient random draws from the posterior 
distribution were used for all estimated model parameters (fixed effects (THETAs), random effects (ETAs) 
and residual error (EPS) effects). For each patient and simulated trial, the viral load time course was then 
simulated using the mrgsolve R package. Then, the median and 90% prediction interval around the median 
were calculated on a per treatment arm basis after binning simulated viral load measurements by time, and 
patient group (IC adult or IC paediatric).

Dataset. The data included 116 and 120 quantifiable plasma concentrations of oseltamivir and OC, 
respectively, collected from 30 immunocompromised subjects (26 and 4 subjects from studies NV25719 and 
NV20234, respectively). For oseltamivir, 3 samples were below the limit of quantification and excluded, as 
well as 1 evaluable data point that was not consistent with the dosing history. No OC samples were excluded. 
Figure 5.2.1 and Figure 5.2.2 display the individual plasma concentration profiles for oseltamivir and OC, 
respectively, versus time (time after first dose) and time after dose for both studies.

The analysis included paediatric subjects from 1 to <18 years old with a wide range of weights (from 9.4 kg 
to 60.6 kg). Of 30 subjects with PK, there were 10 (33%) females and 3 (10%) had transplantation. 
Approximately equal number received the low (16/30; 53%) and high (14/30; 47%) doses. Majority of 
subjects were younger than 13 years old (28/30; 93%) and approximately equal number (9, 7, 9) were in 
the first three weight groups (< 15 kg, 15-23 kg, and 23-40 kg respectively). The summaries of covariates,

clearance were added; the parameters for these effects were estimated while all other parameters remained 
fixed. The summary of model runs is presented in Table 5.2.3. Each run converged successfully and provided 
estimates of standard errors. Of tested models, the Prior Model 1 (Run 013; OFV 2047.351) had lower 
objective function value than Prior Model 2 (Run 102 and Run 112; OFV 2072.955 and 2072.877), while the 
values of standard deviation for the random effect on OC apparent clearance (CLM) were similar between the 
models. The Prior Model 1 (Run 013) was selected for further analyses. 
Table 5.2.3. Summary of NONMEM Runs for Model Development. 
The basic goodness of fit plots for Run 013 showed no major deficiencies. However, the plots of random 
effects versus age (Figure 5.2.3) and weight (Figure 5.2.4) revealed model misspecification, as the random 
effects on clearance of oseltamivir (CL) and oseltamivir carboxylate (CLM) decreased with age and weight. 
The individual estimates of CL and CLM for paediatric IC subjects plotted versus age and weight were 
superimposed with the respective estimates for otherwise healthy paediatric and adult subjects and adult IC 
subjects in Figure 5.2.5. Based on a visual inspection of the plot it was observed that the distributions of CL 
and CLM for IC and otherwise healthy subjects were similar for young subjects (< 10 years of age). For 
patients 10 years and older, CL and CLM were lower in IC patients as compared to the corresponding 
parameters for otherwise healthy subjects. Run 018 implemented this observation by allowing separate 
effects of IC status for subjects younger than 10 years and subjects of 10-years old or older (Table 5.2.3). 
The estimates of the IC effect in younger subjects were close to no-effect level and confidence intervals 
included 1. When these effects were fixed to 1 (Run 019), the objective function increased by only 2 points 
(Table 5.2.3). This model (Run 109) was selected as the final model.

Results of the final model (Run 019) indicated that IC paediatric subjects younger than 10 years old 
appeared to have similar apparent clearances of oseltamivir and OC compared to otherwise healthy subjects 
in the same age range, whereas in IC paediatric subjects from 10 to 17 years of age the apparent clearances 
of oseltamivir and OC were decreased by 44.4% (95%CI: 26.8 - 62.0%) and 49.1% (95%CI: 34.5 - 63.8%), 
respectively, compared to otherwise healthy subjects in the same age range.

Run 019 goodness of fit plots for oseltamivir and OC did not reveal any major deficiencies; plots for OC are 
displayed in Figure 5.2.6. The plots of random effects versus age (Figure 5.2.7) and weight (Figure 5.2.8) 
indicated improved fit compared with Run 013. The normalized prediction distribution errors (NPDE) plots 
and visual predictive check (VPC) plots confirmed the ability of the model to predict the central tendency and 
variability of the observed data; plots for OC are shown in Figure 5.2.9 and Figure 5.2.10. Overall, the 
diagnostic plots demonstrated that the model could be used to predict oseltamivir and OC exposures in 
immunocompromised subjects and that individual predictions of exposure could be used for 
exposure-response analyses.

(blue) of the simulated (solid) and observed (dash) concentrations. The simulated values were computed 
from 1000 trials simulated using dosing, sampling, and the covariate values of the analysis dataset. 
Model-Based PK Simulations. Model/Run 019 was used to simulate individual estimates of PK parameters 
and steady-state exposures for IC paediatric patients.   
IC paediatric subjects in study NV25719 were treated with weight- and age-based conventional dose (N=14) 
or 3x conventional dose (N=12). Summary of model-predicted individual steady-state exposure estimates 
for oseltamivir and OC are presented in Table 5.2.4. Most exposure metrics indicated approximately 2 times 
higher exposure in the 3x conventional dose, i.e. less than proportional increase in exposure with increasing 
dose. None of the established oseltamivir PK models indicated non-linearity, thus the apparent nonlinearity 
of exposure observed in this study was considered to be related to an imbalance of covariates in the two 
dosing groups. There were 6 patients > 10 years of age (range: 10-12 years) in the conventional dose group

(mean age of 7 years, mean weight of 27 kg), whereas none of the patients in the 3x conventional dose 
group were > 10 years of age (mean age 4 years, mean weight of 19 kg). As estimated CL and CLM were 44% 
and 49% lower in 10 to < 18 years old IC paediatric patients, whereas clearances were unchanged in IC 
paediatric patients < 10 years, this might explain the lower than dose-proportional increase of exposure with 
dose. Furthermore, there was one patient in the conventional dose group who had a history of nephrectomy 
and low estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) (62 mL/min/1.73m2) on the PK assessment day, but not at 
baseline.

Subsequently, oseltamivir and OC exposures in IC paediatric subjects of study NV25719 were compared with 
exposures of otherwise healthy paediatric subjects of study WV15758. A stratification by age allows to 
further illustrate the model finding with similar or slightly higher predicted oseltamivir and OC exposures in 
IC subjects younger than 10 years old and in paediatric otherwise healthy subjects (Table 5.2.5), while in 
older paediatric IC subjects the predicted oseltamivir and OC exposures were approximately 2.1-2.2 fold 
higher than in paediatric otherwise healthy subjects (Table 5.2.6).

Time-to-Event analyses. Notable ER relationships were not identified for time to cessation of viral shedding, 
determined by culture and RT-PCR (Figure 5.2.11), although a trend for faster resolution of symptoms 
(including fever) was observed for high exposure group (Figure 5.2.12).

had treatment-emergent phenotypic resistance. There were no differences in exposures between patients 
that developed and did not develop resistance (Figure 5.2.13). These results do not suggest a benefit (i.e. 
less viral resistance) coming from a higher exposure to OC.

Disease modelling 
Dataset: The IC paediatric population consisted of data from 36 patients (N = 20 from study NV25719 and 
N = 16 from study NV20234); the IC adult population consisted of data from 156 IC patients (N = 150 from 
study NV20234 and N = 6 from study NV25118). The model estimation dataset contained longitudinal 
influenza (type A or B) viral load observations from studies NV20234, NV25719, and NV25118. The 
combined model estimation data set consisted of 1,202 viral load observations taken from192 individuals. 
Across all studies, there were 618 viral load observations that were BLQ, comprising 51.4% of all 
observations in the data set. The BLQ observations were distributed evenly amongst all studies. 
Observed viral kinetics: The majority of individuals in both IC adult and IC paediatric patient populations 
showed rapid declines in viral load as a result of treatment (Figure 5.2.14). IC adult and IC paediatric 
patients appear to qualitatively exhibit similar viral kinetics. Additionally, both IC paediatric and IC adult

patient populations contain a relatively small number of individuals who exhibited rebounding viral loads. 
The time courses of viral loads were visually explored against covariates to discern potential trends. In 
general, differences were not apparent either within or between IC adult and IC paediatric populations when 
stratified by virus type, transplant type, high or low (i.e. standard) oseltamivir dose (Figure 5.18), and 
treatment duration.

Disease model: Models with paediatric population covariates outperformed the base model (Table 5.2.9). 
Models with paediatric population covariates on both δ and c and only on δ outperformed the model with 
paediatric population covariate only on c. For reasons of model parsimony, the model including only the 
paediatric population effect on δ was selected as the final base model. As no covariates were found to be 
significant sources of additional inter- or intra-subject variability in model parameters, this was the final 
model. Parameter estimates of the final model are summarised in Table 5.2.10.

Figure 5.2.15 shows population- and individual-predicted viral load versus observed viral load for IC adult 
and IC paediatric patients. Observations BLQ appear as red dots and rebound viral load observations as light 
blue dots. In both population and individual predictions, discrepancies at high viral loads are due to the limit 
on the number of target cells. The population-predicted viral load versus observed panels show a systematic 
under-prediction in the lower-left tail of the observed data. As seen by the concentration of red and blue 
points in this region, the population under-prediction is largely due to a combination of observations at or 
approaching BLQ and observations from a relatively small number of subjects that exhibited viral rebound. 
The rebounding viral load profiles from these subjects represent a departure from the majority of the 
populations’ viral load profiles and is thereby difficult to capture in population-predicted viral loads. In 
contrast, however, rebound viral load observations are sufficiently captured at the individual-prediction 
level.

values, stratified by patient population 
Figure 5.2.16 shows the model predicted 10th, 50th and 90th percentile viral load trajectories versus observed 
data. In general, the model recapitulates the time course of the observed viral dynamics and accurately 
represents the point at which large fractions of the observed data reach the limit of quantification. The slight 
discrepancy between model predicted peak viral loads and observed peak viral loads is likely due to a limit 
on the number of target cells in the model. The change in slope in the predicted viral load shortly after 10 
days is likely an artefact of aggregating several different scenarios near this time period, such as the 
variability in the timing of withdrawal of treatment and the occurrence of rebounding viral loads. Individual 
predictions (presented in Appendix of the modelling report), however, clearly highlight the model’s ability to 
represent subject-level variability in such timings and rebounding of viral load.

Model Simulations: Clinical trial simulations, using the final model parameters, were performed to 
investigate the impact of dose, time of initiation of oseltamivir therapy and treatment duration. Figure 
5.2.17 illustrates how the dose-response relationship translates to effect on the viral load curve with 
simulations of the time course of influenza viral load without treatment and with oseltamivir study doses 
(conventional, 2x and 3x conventional dose administered BID for 10 days; treatment started 2 days after 
onset of symptoms). A conventional dose produces similar viral kinetics to a 2x or 3x conventional dosing 
regimen and suggests a similar treatment effect of oseltamivir for the IC paediatric and the IC adult 
population.

Figure 5.2.18 illustrates the simulated effect of oseltamivir treatment duration over 3, 5 and 10 days of 
conventional oseltamivir dose BID. The simulated viral load versus time curve suggests that treatment 
duration of 10 days limits potential occurrences of viral rebound, which occurs with shorter treatment 
duration of 3 or 5 days. Finally, model-based simulations indicated that early start of treatment after onset 
of symptoms is favourable to show maximum impact on viral load, which accelerates cessation of viral 
shedding.

5.3 Discussion 
Pharmacokinetics: Pharmacokinetics of the pro-drug oseltamivir and the active metabolite OC in IC 
paediatric patients with influenza were investigated using population PK modelling. Because the data for this 
new population were limited, previously developed models were utilised. This approach is appropriate. The 
selected PK model was based on extensive oseltamivir and OC concentration-time data following oseltamivir 
oral and intravenous administration in paediatric and young adult subjects and developmental physiological 
changes are taken into account.  
In IC adult patients, approximately 30−35% reduction in the apparent clearances of oseltamivir and OC has 
been reported. The current PK analyses indicated that in IC paediatric subjects from 10 to 17 years of age 
the apparent clearances of oseltamivir and OC were decreased by 44% (95% CI: 26.8−62.0%) and 49% 
(95% CI: 34.5−63.8%), respectively, compared to otherwise healthy (OwH) subjects in the same age 
range. One IC subject in this age group (a patient with a history of nephrectomy and a decreased creatinine 
clearance on a PK assessment day, but not at baseline) had very low estimated OC clearance. IC paediatric 
subjects from one to <10 years old appeared to have similar apparent clearances of oseltamivir and OC 
compared to otherwise healthy subjects in the same age range. Simulations indicated that the predicted OC 
exposures in IC subjects <10 years old were comparable (4-9% higher) with otherwise healthy subjects in 
the same age range, whereas in older paediatric IC subjects the predicted OC exposures were approximately 
2.1-2.2 fold higher than in otherwise healthy subjects in the same age range. When the IC subject with 
nephrectomy was excluded, the point estimates of predicted OC exposures were approximately 1.7−1.8 fold 
higher than in otherwise healthy subjects in the same age range. These figures were based on data from only 
5 IC subjects from 10 to 17 years of age. For comparison, in adult IC patients the average OC exposures 
were approximately 2 fold higher than in otherwise healthy adults (see EMEA/H/C/000402/II/0136). 
Approximately half of this difference was attributed to impaired renal function in IC patients, many of whom 
had a history of renal transplantation, and the other half to unidentified factors. In other words, apparent 
clearance of OC was decreased by 50% in IC adults compared with OwH adults with similar renal function.  
It remains unknown why in the younger children 1 to <10 years of age the PK of OC was similar in IC and 
otherwise healthy subjects, in contrast to lower OC clearance and higher exposure observed in older children 
and adults. The underlying reason for IC status (e.g. primary immunodeficiency vs. immunosuppression due 
to organ transplant) may be one contributing factor. The available data are too limited to explore this aspect. 
There were no IC patients younger than 1 years of age in the dataset. It can be expected, however, that the 
population PK model that accounts for developmental physiological changes taking place in the two first 
years after birth is applicable also for IC patients younger than 1 years of age.    
Exposure-Response: No relationships were identified between exposure to OC (predicted steady state 
Cmin) and virologic efficacy endpoints time to cessation of viral shedding by culture and by RT-PCR. This was 
not surprising, because the trough levels achieved with the conventional dose are already near or at the 
plateau of the previously established exposure-response curve. Furthermore, exposure-response analyses 
did not indicate that higher than conventional dose would decrease development of viral resistance to 
oseltamivir in IC children. Time to resolution of symptoms appeared to be shorter in the high exposure group 
as compared to the low exposure group, which was driven by data observed in study NV25719. Of note, the 
CARIFS symptom score might not be optimal for IC paediatric population (see section Clinical Efficacy of this 
AR).  For comparison, previously conducted analyses in IC adult patients treated with conventional and 
double dose did not indicate exposure-response relationships for virologic and symptomatic efficacy 
endpoints (EMEA/H/C/000402/II/0136).  
Viral kinetics model: Influenza disease PK / viral kinetics model in IC paediatric and adult patients was 
also submitted by the MAH; a similar model for IC adult patients was assessed in procedure 
EMEA/H/C/000402/II/0136. Although some assumptions were not verified, it can be agreed that the 
observed data could be described reasonably well by the model. It was estimated that IC paediatric patients 
Assessment report  
EMEA/H/C/000402/II/0142 
Page 48/118 
 
  
  
had approximately 22% (90%CI 4.4-37.3) lower infected cell clearance rate than IC adult patients, whereas 
the free influenza virus clearance rate was similar in IC paediatric and adult patients. Model-based 
simulations indicated that undetectable virus levels were achieved approximately four days earlier following 
treatment with oseltamivir compared with no treatment. Conventional, double and triple doses produced 
essentially the same effect on viral load profiles, which is in agreement with the results of the 
exposure-response analyses summarized above. Importantly, the simulations suggested that a 5-day 
treatment (which is recommended for OwH subjects) is associated with a risk of viral rebound in IC 
paediatric patients, and that a 10-day treatment could decrease this risk. It is known that treatment should 
be initiated early for best efficacy, which was also observed in the simulations.  
See also section 8 of this AR for discussion on extrapolation. 
6.  Studies providing data on oseltamivir treatment of 
paediatric IC patients 
The paediatric and adolescent data from studies NV20234 and NV25719 are presented in this section. As 
both clinical study reports have been assessed previously (see section Introduction of this AR), no thorough 
assessment of the design, methodology etc. of the studies is included in this AR; only data relevant for the 
current variation are included. 
The applicant has in the current submission summarised efficacy results from these two studies separately, 
instead of pooled, to avoid masking the differences observed between them. However, resistance and safety 
results have been pooled for the present analysis. 
Assessor’s comment 
Pooling  of  the  resistance  and  safety  results  is  deemed  acceptable.  Taking  in  account  the  different 
background  conditions  and  different  posology  implemented  in  studies  NV20234  and  NV25719,  it  is 
appropriate that clinical efficacy results have not been pooled. 
6.1 Study NV20234 
6.1.1 Study design 
NV20234 was a phase III, double blind, randomized, multicentre study of conventional and double dose 
oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza in IC patients. Immunocompromised patients, who developed an 
influenza-like illness and tested positive with a rapid diagnostic test, reverse transcription−polymerase chain 
reaction (RT-PCR), or viral culture for influenza, were enrolled during the influenza season. Due to 
widespread use of oseltamivir for treating IC patients in clinical practice at the time the study was designed, 
a placebo arm in NV20234 was considered unethical. Therefore, otherwise healthy (OwH) and “at risk” 
patients (those with chronic respiratory and/or cardiac conditions) from previous studies served as historical 
controls. This comparison was performed separately for adults (with pivotal adult studies) and for the 
paediatric patients pooled form studies NV25719 and NV20234 (with pivotal paediatric studies). 
In the two comparative arms of the study, oral doses of oseltamivir, conventional dose (as appropriate for 
age group and weight) or double dose were administered twice daily (BID) for 10 days. Of note, the duration 
of the treatment course was in both arm double the conventional course of 5 days. 
Study NV20234 faced significant recruitment challenges. In order to improve recruitment and ensure the 
provision of data within a reasonable timeframe, several amendments to the NV20234 study were 
implemented. These amendments included a change to the study’s primary objective from efficacy to safety 
and resistance and the sample size was reduced from 250 to 166 patients. While efficacy became a 
Assessment report  
EMEA/H/C/000402/II/0142 
Page 49/118 
 
  
  
secondary objective, the same efficacy analyses were still planned. The confidence interval approach to 
compare the treatment groups with matched historical controls was retained.  
The MAH opened more study sites and extended the duration of the study to achieve planned patient 
numbers. Altogether 62 active centres in 19 countries participated in the study. First patient entered the 
study in 2/2008 and last patient in 5/2017. Inclusion criteria were broadened (see below under “Study 
population”. Additionally, patients could be enrolled beyond the 48 hours symptom onset window, up to 96 
hours after symptom onset. 
Patients were randomized 1:1 to conventional oseltamivir or double dose oseltamivir, stratified according to 
four binary stratification factors. Patients randomized under protocol versions A and B were stratified 
according to transplant (SOT, HSCT); time between onset of influenza symptoms and treatment start (≤ 24 
hours, >24 hours); influenza vaccination status for current influenza season (yes, no), and age  (≤12 
years, >12 years).Patients randomized under Protocol C through Protocol F were stratified according to 
transplant (yes, no); time between onset of influenza symptoms and treatment start (up to 96 hours, ≤48 
hours, >48 hours); influenza vaccination status for current influenza season (yes, no); and by age (≤12 
years, >12 years). As only transplant patients were enrolled during protocol A and B, at this time, the

Study population and sample size 
IC adults (patients ≥18 years of age) and children ≥1 and <18 years of age (including adolescents and 
children <13 years of age) with confirmed influenza infection (<96 hours between symptom onset and first 
dose of study medication). 
IC patients were defined as one who met any of the following: 
• 
Primary immunodeficiency at risk for viral infections or 
•  Secondary immunodeficiency 
o  Solid  organ  transplant  (SOT)  with  ongoing  immunosuppression  (severe  combined 
immunodeficiency (SCID), primary T cell deficiency or predominantly antibody deficiency or 
other well-defined immunodeficiency syndromes) or 
o  Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) with ongoing immunosuppression or 
o  HIV with a most recent CD4 count <500/mm3 (or < 25% in children ≤5 years old) within the 
last 6 months and, in the investigator’s opinion, considered immunocompromised or 
o  Haematologic malignancies (ALL, lymphomas; CLL, small lymphocytic lymphoma; hairy cell 
leukaemia,  myelodysplastic  syndromes;  peripheral  T  cell  and  NK  neoplasms,  Hodgkin’s 
disease; AML, CML) or 
o  Systemic immunosuppressive therapy, irrespective of medical indication, started at least 12 
weeks prior to, and ongoing at the time of first dose of study drug  
The study was designed to enrol approximately 166 patients (83 patients per treatment group); final 
enrolment was 228 patients. Only 20 children aged below 18 years were included, 10 to the conventional 
dose group and 10 to the double dose group. Of these 20 children, 7 completed the study in the conventional 
daily dose, and 9 in the double dose group. 
6.1.2 Objectives  
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate prospectively the safety and tolerability of oseltamivir for 
the treatment of influenza in IC patients and characterize the effects of oseltamivir in IC patients on the 
development of resistant influenza virus. 
The secondary objectives of the study were to evaluate the effects of conventional and double dose 
oseltamivir in IC patients on: 
• 
The population PK of oseltamivir and OC in IC patients with confirmed influenza infection, through 
the  application  of  established  population  PK  models  to  the  sparse  plasma  concentration  data 
generated 
• 
• 
The virologic course of influenza (proportion shedding and viral loads at different timepoints) 
The time to resolution of influenza symptoms

• 
The clinical course of influenza (fever, symptoms, secondary illnesses as evidenced by otitis media, 
bronchitis, pneumonia, or sinusitis)

illnesses (lower respiratory tract complications), and hospitalizations, and length of stay during 
hospitalization. 
6.2 Study NV25719 
Study NV25719 was  phase IB, open-label, randomized, multicentre, parallel-group design study with two 
experimental treatment arms to generate data for the purpose of extrapolation of efficacy from adults with 
immunodeficiency and to compare and/or integrate exposure and response observations in the paediatric IC 
population to that seen in other, non-immunocompromised populations. 
• To estimate the exposure achieved with each of different dose levels of oseltamivir through the application 
of an established population PK (popPK) model to the sparse concentration data generated. 
• To examine the duration of treatment, of viral shedding, and of fever and to examine the safety, 
tolerability, incidence of influenza-associated complications and of resistance observed with different doses 
and duration of treatment and characterize any resistant virus isolate in terms of sequence and phenotype. 
6.2.1 Study design 
A young (<13 years of age) and highly IC patient population was chosen for this study, considered to be the 
most at-risk for viral resistance due to their young age and severe IC status. These factors were deemed to 
increase the chances of prolonged viral shedding and therefore, increase the likelihood of viral resistance. 
Comparing the conventional and 3x conventional doses of oseltamivir in this patient population was 
expected to enable estimation of the exposure achieved with two different dose levels of oseltamivir to 
generate data for extrapolation of efficacy from IC adults and to evaluate the virological outcomes,

resistance, safety and tolerability, in this highly IC patient population. The extrapolation plan has however 
changed to include extrapolation from OwH children with influenza. 
The MAH’s rational for the study setting was that this population, where treatment for influenza was both 
indicated and available, a placebo arm could not be justified. The only potential active comparator, 
zanamivir, was not indicated in children below 7 years of age. Consequently, offering only one treatment in 
an open-label fashion represented the most appropriate approach in this patient group. As the primary aim 
of the study was to evaluate PK/PD, which are objective assessments, the impact of not blinding on the study 
results was considered minimal by the MAH. 
Patients were enrolled at 16 active centres in 8 countries. 
Figure 6.2.1 
 Study NV25719 design 
The dosing of oseltamivir was adapted to cessation of viral shedding (Figure 6.2.1). Dosing was stopped 
when viral shedding ended, or at Day 20, whichever came first. 
Originally, three daily dose levels had been planned (conventional, double and triple dose). However, the 
middle dose cohort was discontinued by amendment with a concomitant increase in the size of the remaining 
two dose cohorts. 
Oseltamivir was administered at a dose of 30 to 225 mg orally BID for a minimum of 5 days (Table 6.2.1). 
Subsequent adaptive dosing continued until absence of viral shedding, demonstrated by a negative PCR 
result, up to a maximum duration of 20 days. If viral shedding persisted after Day 20, patients had to 
discontinue study treatment and receive standard of care treatment for that region. The dosing regimen was 
adjusted according to age, weight cohort, and illness duration.

Table 6.2.1 
 Dosing regimen according to age and dose group 
The total study duration ranged from approximately 35 to 50 days, depending on the extent of total 
treatment duration and the timing of the follow-up visits. This comprised of the following: 
•  5 days minimum dosing period 
•  Up to 15 days of potential additional treatment period 
•  At least 30 days of follow-up period post last dose 
At least 20 patients, including at least 12 patients with <48 hours of influenza symptoms duration at 
randomization and including at least 10 patients per dose cohort, were to be enrolled. 
Study population and sample size 
The study population comprised of paediatric IC patients less than 13 years of age with a 
laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of influenza (e.g., by PCR, culture, or rapid influenza detection test) who 
were receiving induction, consolidation, or re-intensification chemotherapy for a haematological malignancy 
or were undergoing a conditioning regimen either prior to haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) or less 
than 6 months after HSCT. 
The main analysis populations included the intent-to-treat population (ITT), the intent-to-treat 
influenza-infected population (ITTi), the pharmacokinetic evaluable population (PKEP) and the safety 
evaluable population (SEP) (the same as the ITT population). 
No sample size calculation was performed. The planned sample size of a minimum of 20 influenza-infected 
enrolled patients was arrived at empirically, taking into account the prevalence of the patient population and 
primary objective of the study. This included the randomization of at least 12 influenza-infected patients 
with less than 48 hours of influenza symptom duration and at least 10 patients per dose cohort. 
Assessors’ comment 
The open-label setting may have introduced potential bias in terms of safety assessments (particularly AE 
reporting). This issue is not considered major, taking in account the relatively good tolerability of oseltamivir 
in general. The safety results have been presented by the MAH pooled from the two studies (NV20234 and 
NV25719). 
The  severe  background  conditions  of  the  subjects  are  prone  to  confound  symptoms  of  influenza,  which 
decreases reliability of the obtained efficacy data based on clinical symptoms.

Treatments 
Oseltamivir was administered at a dose of 30 to 225 mg orally BID for a minimum of 5 days. Subsequent 
adaptive dosing continued until absence of viral shedding, demonstrated by a negative PCR result, up to a 
maximum duration of 20 days. If viral shedding persisted after Day 20, patients had to discontinue study 
treatment and receive standard of care treatment for that region. The dosing regimen was adjusted 
according to age, weight cohort, and illness duration (Table 6.2.2.). Infants less than one year of age would 
receive an oseltamivir dose of 3 mg/kg (equivalent to conventional dose).  
Table 6.2.2 
 Dosing regimen according to age and dose group 
6.2.2 Objectives 
• 
To generate data for the purpose of extrapolation of efficacy from adults with immunodeficiency and to 
compare and/or integrate exposure and response observations in the paediatric immunocompromised 
population to that seen in other, non-immunocompromised populations. 
• 
To estimate the exposure achieved with each of different dose levels of oseltamivir through the 
application of an established population PK (popPK) model to the sparse concentration data generated. 
• 
To examine the duration of treatment, of viral shedding, and of fever and to examine the safety, 
tolerability, incidence of influenza-associated complications and of resistance observed with different 
doses and duration of treatment and characterize any resistant virus isolate in terms of sequence and 
phenotype. 
Outcomes/endpoints  
The following endpoints were assessed to address study objectives: 
• 
Pharmacokinetics: PK characterization for oseltamivir and OC was based on an established PopPK 
multi-compartment  model  and  assessed  model-predicted  PK  parameters:  steady-state  AUC0-12, 
• 
• 
Cmax, Cmin, tmax, apparent clearance (CL) and volume of distribution for oseltamivir and OC. 
Pharmacodynamics:  virologic  endpoints  (resistance,  viral  load,  viral  shedding,  persistent  viral 
shedding). 
PK/PD: Exposure-response analyses were performed for patients who had PK samples and PD data. 
Exposure-response relationships were evaluated graphically, using regression (linear and logistic) 
models and time-to-event by exposure curves, as appropriate. 
• 
Efficacy: Time to resolution (TTR) of all symptoms (TTRAS), TTR of fever, and duration of treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMEA/H/C/000402/II/0142 
Page 55/118 
 
  
  
 
 
Time to resolution of all symptoms (TTRAS) was defined as the time in hours from randomization to the start 
of the 24-hour period in which all 18 symptoms items (Canadian Acute Respiratory Illness and Flu Scale 
[CARIFS] 18-symptom scale) had scores of ≤1 (minor problem) and remained ≤1 for at least 21.5 hours. 
Symptoms of influenza-like illness were captured at baseline and twice daily throughout the study using the 
CARIFS and were graded on a nominal scale from 0 (absent or no problem) to 3 (severe or major problem). 
The MAH states in the CSR that CARIFS has been validated for use in otherwise healthy children (Whitley RJ, 
Hayden FG, Reisinger KS, et al. Oral Oseltamivir Treatment of Influenza in Children. Pediatr Infect Dis J 
2001, 20 (2):127–33); however, obviously not for children with background conditions or IC children. 
The CARIFS questionnaire consists of 18 items covering symptoms, function and parental impact of illness, 
and includes several measures that are not specific to influenza but to general health: 1) poor appetite, 2) 
not sleeping well, 3) irritable, cranky, fussy, 4) feels unwell, 5) low energy, tired, 6) not playing well, 7) 
crying more than usual, 8) needing extra care, 9) clinginess, 10) headache, 11) sore throat, 12) muscle 
aches or pains,13) fever, 14) cough, 15) nasal congestion, runny nose, 16) vomiting, 17) not interested in 
what’s going on, 18) unable to get out of bed. Some of the symptoms reported as associated with influenza 
are likely confounded with side effects from other concomitant treatments and illnesses (e.g. leukaemia, 
chemotherapy). 
Assessor’s comment 
It is noteworthy that the method of recording clinical outcomes was in this study different from the diary 
used in pivotal clinical studies with oseltamivir in adult and adolescent patients. In the pivotal studies in 
adults and adolescents, patients recorded their symptoms themselves on a 7-symptom diary. The CARIFS 
questionnaire is filled out by the guardian of the paediatric patient. However, the same method has been 
used in paediatric studies on oseltamivir.  
The CARIFS questionnaire includes several measures that are not specific to influenza but to general health. 
Some  of  the  symptoms  reported  as  associated  with  influenza  are  likely  confounded  with  symptoms  of 
background conditions and side effects from other concomitant treatments (e.g. poor appetite and sleeping, 
crankiness, tiredness, clinginess, lack of interest, being not able to get out of bed could be due to leukaemia; 
muscle aches and vomiting by chemotherapy, etc.). Hence, in a severely ill patient population for which the 
scale has not been validated, the efficacy results obtained should be interpreted with great caution. Using 
any symptom diary could be seen more reliable in OwH patients, as the observed symptoms can in OwH 
patients be addressed to the acute infection. 
Influenza  infection  per  se  is  very  similar  across  different  patients  groups,  as  respiratory  and  systemic 
symptoms  are  present  and  there  is  a  risk  of  secondary  bacterial  infections  and  other  complications. 
Nevertheless,  there  are  some  issues  in  comparing  symptoms  in  OwH  and  IC  patients.  The 
immunocompromised  state  causes  attenuation  of  fever  and  other  inflammatory-derived  symptoms  of 
influenza in IC subjects. Even complications of influenza are considered to be related to the inflammatory 
response. E.g., the damage to lungs during Influenza A infection is thought to be mostly due to cytokine 
storm  (Yang,  Tang.  Aberrant  coagulation  causes  a  hyper-inflammatory  response  in  severe  influenza 
pneumonia. Cell Mol Immunol. 2016 Jul; 13(4): 432–442, doi: 10.1038/cmi.2016.1).  
Consequently,  due  to  the  somewhat  different  clinical  picture  of  influenza  in  OwH  and  IC  subjects,  the 
estimation  of  efficacy  of  oseltamivir  might  not  have  been  fully  reliable  as  based  solely  on  comparison 
between time to resolution of symptoms in OwH and IC subjects even if the studies on IC patients had been 
powered for efficacy. Even a direct comparison between OwH and IC subjects would not necessarily have 
been reliable demonstration of efficacy of oseltamivir in IC subjects, as even fever is more often absent 
already at baseline in IC subjects than in OwH subjects with influenza. Therefore, time to resolution of fever 
could be shorter in IC patients than in OwH patients even if the infection had not been cured; and on the 
other hand, the true recovery from any infection is expected to be slower in IC subjects.  
Assessment report  
EMEA/H/C/000402/II/0142 
Page 56/118 
 
  
  
Therefore, the disease modelling based on objective viral outcomes is considered more appropriate to define 
course of influenza in IC patients than relying on the presence or absence of clinical symptoms. 
6.3 Results on oseltamivir treatment in paediatric IC subjects 
The results are presented here for children and adolescents from studies NV20234 and NV25719. The 
Clinical Overview and Clinical Summaries included in the current submission contain additional, mostly 
descriptive, paediatric data from these studies that have not been assessed previously. 
6.3.1 Demographic and baseline characteristics 
Both studies included an intent-to-treat (ITT) population, an intent-to-treat influenza-infected population 
(ITTi), a safety-evaluable population (SEP), and a pharmacokinetic-evaluable population (PKEP). Study 
NV20234 also included a modified ITTi population (mITTi). These populations are described below: 
• 
ITT: All randomized IC patients were included in the ITT population. Patients infected with 
oseltamivir-resistant influenza strains at baseline were excluded from this population. Patients were 
summarized under the treatment to which they were randomized. 
• 
ITTi: A subset of ITT patients who had laboratory confirmed influenza infection from any swab 
sample collected at baseline or during the study (by RT-PCR). Efficacy endpoints were evaluated in 
this population. 
•  mITTi (Study NV20234 only): All patients randomized to a particular treatment, regardless of 
whether they received that treatment or not, who received at least one dose of study drug and with 
central laboratory confirmation of influenza infection, excluding patients infected with 
oseltamivir-resistant influenza at baseline. This population was in fact the same as the ITTi. 
•  SEP: The safety evaluable population included all patients who received at least one dose of study 
drug and had a safety assessment performed post randomization. Patients were classified according 
to treatment actually received. 
• 
PKEP: All patients in the ITT population who had at least one post-dose drug concentration 
measurement at a scheduled visit timepoint (excluding those who violated inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, had protocol deviations or unavailable or incomplete data). Patients were summarized 
according to treatment actually received. 
Altogether 46 paediatric IC patients were included in studies NV20234 and NV25719 and received at least 
one dose of study drug (Table 6.3.1.1, SEP). Of these, 36 provided data for efficacy evaluation (Table 
6.3.1.2, ITT).  
Study NV20234 enrolled 20 paediatric patients, 16 of whom contributed data to the mITTi and safety (SEP) 
populations (3 were randomized but not dosed and 1 had baseline resistance). All of the 16 paediatric 
patients who received at least one dose of oseltamivir completed the study (7 in the conventional dose group 
and 9 in the double dose group; mITTi population). These 16 patients comprised 9 children and 7 
adolescents. The PKEP contained only four (4) patients who had PK samples available for analyses. 
Study NV25719 enrolled 30 patients. All 30 patients received at least one dose of oseltamivir and 27 
patients completed the study (14 in the conventional dose group and 13 in the triple dose group). There 
were 3 patients who discontinued the study and 4 patients who discontinued study treatment. The safety 
and ITT populations included all 30 patients enrolled and randomized in the study (15 each in the 
conventional and 3x conventional dose groups).  
The ITTi population included 20 patients who were central laboratory RT-PCR positive for influenza infection. 
Of the 10 patients excluded from ITTi, 8/10 as there was no evidence of influenza infection confirmed by PCR 
Assessment report

Page 57/118 
 
  
  
at the Central Lab at baseline and 2/10 as the patients’ malignancies did not meet the inclusion criteria. As 
a result, there were more patients in the conventional dose group than the 3x conventional dose groups (11 
vs. 9 patients) in ITTi. 
The PKEP population included 26 patients (14 in the conventional dose group and 12 in the 3x conventional 
dose group): two patients were excluded because they did not have any post-dose drug concentration 
measurements and two patients were excluded because they had malignancies not acceptable for inclusion 
into the study.

Table 6.3.1.4 Demographic and baseline characteristics of adolescent patients (<18 Years) in Study 
NV20234 (safety population)
The immunosuppressive conditions in the ITT population of studies NV20234 and NV25719 are presented in 
Tables 6.3.1.5 and 6.3.1.6. 
Imbalances were seen between groups in study NV25719. In the ITT population, the majority of patients 
(71.4%) had acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL) (8 patients [61.5%] vs. 12 patients [80.0%] in the 
conventional dose and 3x conventional dose group, respectively); 4 (14.3%) had acute myeloid leukaemia 
(AML) (all in the conventional dose group) and 2 patients (7.1%) had Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (1 patient 
each in the conventional and in the 3x conventional dose groups). Two patients (13.3%) in the 3x 
conventional dose group labelled with ‘Other’ had solid tumour malignancies, which did not meet the study 
inclusion criteria Two patients (13.3%) in the conventional dose group had an HSCT, while none of the 
patients in the 3x conventional dose group had a haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).

In the paediatric ITTi population of Study NV20234, there was an equal number of patients with 
haematologic malignancies or systemic immunosuppressive therapy (7 patients; 41.2%, in each treatment 
group). Two patients in the conventional dose groups had undergone an HSCT (22.2%) and 3 (17.6%) 
patients had HIV. 
In the pooled Safety/ITT population of IC children (below 13 years of age) from both studies, there were 33 
events of hematologic malignancies and 5 events of systemic immunosuppressive therapy.

Table 6.3.1.6 Immunodeficiency conditions and other baseline characteristics, study NV20234 (ITT) (all 
aged <13 years) 
Assessor’s comment  
The  total  number  of  the  IC  children  and  adolescents  from  studies  NV20234  and  NV25719  was  small 
consisting of only 50 patients, 46 of whom received at least one dose of study drug (39 children <13 years 
of age and 7 adolescents aged 13 to 17 years).  Efficacy evaluation could  only  be  performed  on 20 ITTi 
patients from study NV25719 and 16 mITTi patients from study NV20234. 
The background conditions in the patients varied markedly. Patients in study NV25719 (30 children aged < 
13  years) had  received induction,  consolidation, or re-intensification chemotherapy for a haematological 
malignancy (most prevalent was  ALL, but some  patients had  AML or non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma) or  were 
undergoing a conditioning regimen either prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) or less than 6 
months after HSCT. These patients represent the most severely IC paediatric population investigated. Study 
NV20234 included 20 paediatric patients, 16 of whom received at least one dose of oseltamivir (9 children 
aged  <13  years  and  7  adolescents  aged  13  to  17  years).  The  22  background  conditions  causing 
immunosuppression  among  the  20  paediatric  patients  in  NV20234  were  kidney  transplant  (1),  allogenic 
HSCT  (2),  HIV  with  CD4  count  <500/mm3  (4),  hematologic  malignancies  (8),  and  systemic 
immunosuppressive therapy (7). 
Due to the small number of subjects and variable background conditions, efficacy data from these patients 
should be interpreted with caution. Imbalances between groups in study NV25719 increase confounding by 
background conditions. However, the samples collected from these patients are considered sufficient for 
evaluation  of  posology  based  on  population  PK  analyses,  PK/PD  evaluation,  and  disease  modelling  (see 
Section 6 Clinical Pharmacology aspects and Section 8 Extrapolation of this AR).

Time to treatment from onset of symptoms 
The median time from onset of symptoms to start of treatment was shorter in Study NV25719 than in Study 
NV20234. In the ITTi population of Study NV25719, the median time from onset of symptoms to start of 
treatment was 44.25 hours (range: 20.0−94.8 hours) and was similar between the 2 treatment groups. In 
this study, 6/11 patients in the conventional dose group and 6/9 patients in the higher dose group started 
treatment less than 48 hours from symptom onset. In Study NV20234 the median time from onset of 
symptoms to start of drug in paediatric patients in the safety population was 58.67 hours (range: 8.4 – 
89.6), with patients in the conventional dose group having a slightly longer time from onset of symptoms 
than those in the double dose group (median 65.83 [range 12.3 - 89.6] and 53.75 hours [range 8.4 - 82.4], 
respectively). In this study, 3/7 paediatric patients in the conventional dose group and 4/9 paediatric 
patients in the double dose group started treatment less than 48 hours from symptom onset. 
Assessor’s comment 
When comparing the data on paediatric IC patients with otherwise healthy (OwH) children, it should be born 
in  mind  that  in  Studies  WV15758  and  M76001,  patients  were  enrolled  if  the  duration  between  onset  of 
symptoms and first dose of study drug was 48 hours and  36 hours, respectively. In Studies NV20234 and 
NV25719,  due  to  the  typically  delayed  presentation  of  influenza  symptoms,  because  of  their  IC  status, 
patients were enrolled if the duration between onset of influenza symptoms and first dose of study drug was 
 96 hours. There was however the requirement to include in study NV25719 at least 12 patients, for whom 
oseltamivir was initiated within 48 hours. Hence, the median time to treatment from onset of symptoms was 
shorter in NV25719 than in NV20234. 
It is noteworthy that in adult patients in study NV20234 the efficacy results were (non-significantly) better 
when treatment was initiated within 48 hours vs. later than 48 from onset of symptoms. Therefore, the PI of 
oseltamivir contains the recommendation to start treatment in IC patients as soon as possible. 
6.3.2 Viral resistance 
Resistance was defined as the presence of known mutations conferring resistance to oseltamivir in viruses 
isolated from nasopharyngeal swab samples, or as phenotypic outliers in culture assays.  Viral load was 
determined from nasal swabs using 2 methodologies:  RT-PCR and culture. 
Baseline resistance 
At baseline, none of the patients in Study NV25719 had oseltamivir-resistant influenza viruses (genotypic 
and/or phenotypic) detected in their baseline samples. One adolescent patient from Study NV20234 had an 
oseltamivir-resistant influenza virus at baseline. This patient was infected with an A/H1N1 virus carrying an 
H274Y mutation (genotypic resistance) and was withdrawn from treatment. 
Post-baseline resistance 
In Study NV25719, there were 3 children with post-baseline oseltamivir viral resistance: 1/11 patients 
(9.1%) in the conventional dose group and 2/9 patients (22.2%) in the triple dose group. Both patients in 
the triple dose group had ALL and the patient in the conventional dose group had undergone HSCT. 
Among the children in Study NV20234, three patients developed post-baseline resistance: 2/4 children 
(50%) in the conventional dose group and 1/5 children (20%) in the double dose group.  
None of the 7 adolescent patients in NV20234 had treatment-emergent resistance.  
Assessment report  
EMEA/H/C/000402/II/0142 
Page 64/118 
 
  
  
 
Overall, the majority (5 out of 6) of subjects with post-baseline viral resistance were ≤5 years of age, 4 
children had underlying ALL and 2 children had received HSCT. All of the children with post-baseline resistant 
viruses were infected with influenza type A virus. Three of the children with resistant viruses was patients 
had received the conventional and three had received higher dose of oseltamivir. 
Table 6.3.2.1 presents the characteristics of paediatric IC patients (<13 years of age) with 
treatment-emergent oseltamivir resistance (as none of the teenaged subjects had post-baseline resistance). 
The overall treatment-emergent resistance rate in IC children below 13 years of age was 20.7% (95% CI 8.0% 
to 39.7%).

Six children had treatment-emergent oseltamivir resistance.  Consistent with earlier data, resistance was 
more frequent in younger children, as none of the teenaged patients (13 to 17 years of age) and only one

were 3 to 5 years of age. 
Time to cessation of viral shedding 
For study NV20234, time to cessation of viral shedding (TTCVS) has now been presented by the MAH 
together for children and adolescents (whereas in the previously assessed CSR, results from adults and 
adolescents had been pooled). 
TTCVS by cell culture  
Table 6.3.2.2 shows the median TTCVS by viral culture for IC paediatric patients in studies NV25719 and 
NV20234.  In paediatric patients in Study NV20234, the median TTCVS was longer in the conventional dose 
group compared with the double dose group and with wide CI. The wider CI in the conventional dose group 
of this study compared to double dose is driven by 2 large values collected during the follow-up period of the 
study (i.e. weeks apart rather than hours as determined by the study visits schedule). The range of TTCVS 
was similar between the dose groups when excluding assessments during the follow-up period.

TTCVS=time to cessation of viral shedding 
To attempt to investigate the effect of oseltamivir resistance on the median TTCVS, the MAH repeated the 
analysis was for the conventional and higher dose groups, excluding patients who developed post-baseline 
resistance. In Study NV25719, the median TTCVS excluding patients with post-baseline oseltamivir 
resistance (1 and 2 patients in the conventional and triple dose groups, respectively), only changed slightly 
and remained longer in the conventional dose group than in the triple dose group with wide and overlapping 
CIs (Table 6.3.2.3).  
The MAH states that data from a similar analysis for Study NV20234 is not presented in the Summary of 
Efficacy as the results were mainly driven by the assessments during the follow-up period. The MAH however 
also states that none of the adolescent patients had post-baseline oseltamivir resistance. The TTCVS for 
children and adolescent patients from NV20234 (separately from NV25719) are shown in Table 6.3.2.4.; 
however, this table includes also paediatric patients with post-baseline resistance.

Comparison of viral shedding (by culture) across registration studies and studies on IC subjects 
The results on the time course of patients remaining shedding virus are summarised in table 6.3.2.5 from 
paediatric and adult studies in otherwise healthy subjects and IC subjects.  
OwH adults/adolescents in study M766001 had stopped shedding by Day 4, whereas viral shedding 
continued in OwH children and in IC patients. 
At Day 6, the percentages shedding virus were 32% (oseltamivir group) and 33% (placebo group)  among 
OwH children from study WV15758; 15.4% (oseltamivir conventional dose) and 18.3% (oseltamivir double 
dose) in IC adults from NV20234; and in IC children <13 years of age 4/10 (40%) in the conventional dose 
group and 3/6 in the triple dose group of NV25719: and finally, in the paediatric (1 to 17 years) age group 
of NV20234 3/7 (42.9%) in the conventional dose group and 0/7 in the double dose group. 
At Day 10/11, 2% of OwH children continued shedding both in the oseltamivir and placebo groups. Among 
IC adults from study NV20234, 1/65 in the conventional dose group and 3/71 in the double dose group were 
shedding virus at Day 10/11; whereas from the same study, paediatric patients (from 1 to 17 years old) 1/7

in the conventional dose group and 0/0 in the double dose groups were shedding virus at Day 10/11. In 
Study NV25719, the corresponding numbers were 0/8 in the conventional dose group and 2/4 in the triple 
dose group at Day 10/11. 
Table 6.3.2.5 Summary of patients with viral shedding by visit (by culture) in registration studies 
(WV15758 and M76001) and studies in IC patients (Studies NV20234 and NV25719) 
Assessor’s comments on results by viral culture 
The results obtained by viral culture indicate longer median time to cessation of viral shedding in paediatric 
IC patients receiving conventional dose  of oseltamivir vs. higher dose;  and the results do not markedly 
change by exclusion of patients with post-baseline resistance. The numbers of patients are, however, low, 
and confidence intervals (CI) are very wide. The exact point of median can be considered coincidental when 
CIs are extremely wide. 
When the time course of cessation of viral shedding is compared between otherwise healthy (OwH) historical 
subjects from registration studies and studies on IC  subjects, it is obvious that adult OwH patients stop 
shedding virus earlier than OwH children do and earlier than IC adults and IC paediatric subjects. One third 
of OwH  children were shedding  virus at Day  6 and 2% at  Day 10/11 from  onset of  treatment. In  study 
NV20234, the proportion of adult IC patients with continued shedding at days 6 and 10/11 were roughly 
similar at Days 6 and 10/11 regardless of group  (conventional  vs.  double dose). In the small  paediatric 
subset of NV20234, 3/7 subjects in the conventional dose group and 0/7 in the double dose groups were still 
shedding virus at Day 6, and the respective numbers at Day 10/11 were 1/7 and 0/7. In study NV25719, on 
the other hand, at Day 6 4/10 in the conventional dose group and376 in the triple dose group continued 
shedding virus; the corresponding numbers at Day 10/11 were 0/8 in the conventional and 2/4 in the triple 
dose arm of the study. 
It is in line with prior observative data from e.g. the IRIS study (see section 5 Introduction of this AR) that 
OwH adults stop shedding earlier than OwH children do and earlier than IC patients. The results obtained by 
viral culture on shedding among paediatric IC patients receiving conventional daily dose of oseltamivir vs. 
higher (double or triple) dose are not consistent between studies NV20234 and NV25719. It is obvious that 
Assessment report  
EMEA/H/C/000402/II/0142 
Page 68/118 
 
  
  
 
 
 
among  the  small  number  of  subjects  with  variable  background  conditions  chance  findings  are  to  be 
expected;  hence,  no  robust  interpretation  of  optimal  dose  in  IC  children  can  be  deduced  based  on  the 
results, without help of population PK/PD and disease modelling and extrapolation from other patient groups 
(see sections 6 and 8 of this AR). 
TTCVS by RT-PCR 
In Study NV25719, including patients with post-baseline oseltamivir viral resistance, the median TTCVS was 
shorter in the conventional dose group than in the triple dose group (Table 6.3.2.6, Figure 6.3.2.1) when 
analysed by RT-PCR; of note, the Kaplan-Meier curves crossed in several places. 
In Study NV20234, the median TTCVS in paediatric patients (<18 years of age) was the similar in the 2 
treatment groups (Table 6.3.2.6). However, the wider CI in the conventional dose group is driven by the 
data collected during the follow-up period of this study. 
Table 6.3.2.6. Median TTCVS by RT-PCR for IC paediatric patients in NV25719 and NV20234 
Similar to the cell culture results, the effect of oseltamivir resistance on median TTCVS by RT-PCR was 
determined by repeating the analysis for the 2 treatment groups excluding patients who developed 
post-baseline resistance. 
In Study NV25719, the median TTCVS excluding patients with post-baseline oseltamivir resistance (1 and 2 
patients in the conventional and triple dose groups, respectively), was similar between the dose groups with 
wide and overlapping CIs (Table 6.3.2.7). 
In Study NV20234, exclusion of patients with viral resistance lowered the median TTCVS in the double-dose 
group only, leading to an apparent small difference among paediatric patients receiving different dose 
(181.0 hours [95% CI: 106.2, 946.4] in the conventional dose group vs. 155.6 hours [95% CI: 8.6, 226.3] 
in the double dose group). It should be noted that in the conventional dose group, although 2 patients with 
treatment-emergent resistance were excluded (1 with prolonged viral shedding and 1 with cessation of viral 
shedding before EOT), no change was observed, and in the double dose group, although only 1 patient with 
treatment-emergent resistance was excluded (the patient with the longest viral shedding), a difference was 
observed. Nevertheless, the CIs were broad and overlapping. (Table 6.3.2.7).

Comparison of TTCVS (RT-PCR) with IC adults 
Table 6.3.2.8  demonstrates the results for TTCVS analysed by RT-PCR in all IC patients, adults included. As 
measured by RT-PCR, the median TTCVS was similar across dose groups when patients with resistance were 
excluded.  
The group with the longest median TTCVS was the conventional dose of the IC paediatric patients in Study 
NV20234 (181 hours regardless of whether patients with resistance were excluded). The wide CI of this 
group is driven by patients who were still shedding virus during the follow-up period of the study when the 
frequency of the assessments was low.

Assessor’s comments of TTCVS  
Time to cessation of viral shedding (TTCVS) obtained by culture was shorter than that obtained by RT-PCR 
in  both  studies.  These  methods  furthermore  gave  discrepant  results  (Tables  6.3.2.4  and  6.3.2.6).   The 
observed difference between results from the 2 assays may be partly due to the fact that viral culture assay 
depends on sufficient amount of viable organisms. On the other hand, RT-PCR recognizes fragments and 
non-viable viral particles in addition to viable viruses. Taking in account the small number of patients in all 
paediatric study groups, the marked inter-individual variation in the TTCVS, and the inherent differences 
between  the  two  methods,  no  solid  conclusion  can  be  made  on  the  contradictory  results.  The  observed 
difference in the results on median time to viral clearance obtained by viral culture and by PCR is likely due 
to chance. As can be seen in table 6.3.2.5, the different times to viral clearance were based on very few 
subjects. This issue is not pursued further.  
The subjects with post-baseline resistance had prolonged viral shedding, as expected based on previous 
studies.  In  Study  NV25719,  there  were  3  children  with  post-baseline  oseltamivir  viral  resistance:  1/11 
patients (with HSCT) in the conventional dose group and 2/9 patients (with ALL) in the triple dose group.  
Among the children in Study NV20234, three patients developed post-baseline resistance: 2/4 children in 
the conventional dose group (1 with HSCT and 1 with ALL) and 1/5 children in the double dose group (the 
patient had ALL).  
None of the 7 adolescent patients in NV20234 had treatment-emergent resistance.  
Overall, the majority (5 out of 6) of subjects with post-baseline viral resistance were ≤5 years of age. All of 
the  children  with  post-baseline  resistant  viruses  were  infected  with  influenza  type  A  virus.  Three  of  the 
children with resistant viruses had received the conventional daily dose and three had received higher dose 
of oseltamivir, one of whom had received double dose and 2 had received triple dose of oseltamivir. TTCVS 
was 10, 29, and 40 days in the 3 individual children treated with conventional dose, and 15, 18, and 51 days 
in the 3 patients treated with higher dose of oseltamivir.   
As a conclusion, the small numbers and large inter-individual variation do not allow for direct interpretation 
of the effect of conventional vs. higher dose of oseltamivir on emergence of postbaseline viral resistance or 
duration to viral clearance. Hence, the extrapolation of recommended dose for IC children based on PK/PD 
and disease modelling and extrapolation from IC adults and OwH children is deemed necessary, as has been 
previously accepted. 
Literature data on oseltamivir resistance reviewed by the MAH  
The MAH has included in the submission a review of publications on the treatment of influenza in children 
(and adults), including both immunocompetent and immunocompromised (IC) patients (table 6.3.2.9.). The 
studies are mostly observational and small (with a smaller number of IC patients than in Studies NV25719 
and NV20234). However, the results on resistance in published literature is in general similar to studies 
NV25719 and NV20234. The incidence of post-baseline resistance is higher in IC children than in otherwise 
healthy (OwH) children. Similar results have been obtained in IC adults compared with OwH adults (Alonso 
et al, Tramontana et al) and on the treatment of influenza in children (Stephenson et al) (Table 6.3.2.9).

Assessor’s comment  
The results from the analyses of treatment-emergent resistance in studies NV20234 and NV25719 are in line 
with the scarce data available from literature. The incidence of oseltamivir resistance in all children treated 
in  Roche  sponsored  studies  is  4.5%  (78/1727).  This  incidence  encompasses  mainly  OwH  children  (EU 
SmPC). 
The overall incidence of treatment-emergent resistance in IC children was 20.7% (6/29) (95% CI 8.0% to 
39.7%) (Section 2.3.2), which was higher than the incidence for OwH children and IC adults, but similar to 
that seen in OwH infants <1 year (18.3% [13/71]) (EU SmPC).

6.3.3 Clinical efficacy 
Time to resolution of symptoms (TTRAS) was defined in children as follows: the time from treatment 
initiation to the start of the 24-hour period in which all 18 symptoms items of the CARIFS (see section 7.2.2) 
had scores ≤1 (minor or no problem) and remained ≤1 for at least 21.5 hours. If a score of 4 (“do not know” 
or “not applicable”) occurred at any assessment during the study for any given symptom, the assessment 
was not be included in the calculation of the resolution of all CARIFS symptoms. Patients with symptom 
scores ≤1 at baseline, which remained ≤1 for at least 21.5 hours thereafter, would have a TTRAS set to 
missing. Patients with symptom scores ≤1 at baseline followed immediately by scores ≤1 for at least 21.5 
hours would have a TTRAS set to zero. 
In adolescents (and adults) in study NV20234, the TTRAS was defined using a 7-symptom score card filled 
out by the study subjects.  
Results on the median TTRAS for the IC children (<13 years of age) from studies NV25719 and NV20234 are 
presented in Table 6.3.3.1 (ITTi population) and Figures 6.3.3.1 and 6.3.3.2.

Among the 7 adolescent subjects from NV20234, the TTRAS varied as follows: the individual values were 0, 
126, 173 and 304 hours in the conventional treatment arm and 63.2, 111 and 326 hours in the double dose 
group (the 0 value corresponds to a patient with symptoms at baseline but no further records.)

Time to resolution of fever 
For both studies, the small number of patients with fever at baseline limits data interpretation: 8/20 children 
in Study NV25719 and 3/9 children in Study NV20234 had fever at baseline. 
In Study NV25719, 4/11 children in the conventional and 4/9 children in the triple dose groups had fever at 
baseline. The median TTR of fever in patients with baseline fever was 17.1 hours longer in the conventional 
dose group than the triple dose group (28.4 vs. 11.3 hours). 
In Study NV20234, there were 3 children with fever at any time from baseline onwards. The TTR of fever for 
the patient in the conventional dose group was censored as defined in the Statistical Analysis Plan. The TTR 
of fever in the patients in the double dose group was 0 and 51.9 hours. 
Assessor’s comments  
In children below 13 years of age in Study NV20234, the median time to resolution of all symptoms (TTRAS) 
was  32.1 hours (95% CI: 20.2, not evaluable, NE) in the study group treated with the conventional dose and 
115.9 hours (95% CI: 45.5, 495.0) in the group treated with double dose of oseltamivir.  
In the study NV25719, on the contrary, the median TTRAS was longer in the conventional dose group than 
in the higher dose group (179.4 hours (95% CI: 24.7, not estimable) and 34.5 hours (95% CI: 0.0, 84.9), 
respectively. 
It is to be noted that the patient populations in NV20234 and NV25719 were different, the latter being more 
severely  ill.  The  MAH  has  also  stated  that  there  was  imbalance  between  study  arms  of  NV26719, 
Furthermore, the CARIFS score includes several items that may be positive due to severe overall condition 
of study subjects with leukaemia, concomitant chemotherapy etc., which is expected to confound results in 
such a small study. Nevertheless, the difference in TTRAS between patients in the conventional and triple 
dose groups is seemingly large in study NV25719.  
Analysis  excluding  patients  with  post-baseline  oseltamivir  resistance  did  not  change  these  trends  found 
among IC children in studies NV 20234 and NV 25719.  
The analysis on the time to resolution of fever is based on even less patients than analysis on TTRAS, since 
only 8/20 children in Study NV25719 and 3/9 children in Study NV20234 had fever at baseline; reflecting 
obviously the IC condition of the subjects. Therefore, no reliable comparison between different doses can be 
performed regarding resolution of fever. 
Due to the small number of patients and extremely large variation, the efficacy results of these studies are 
deemed insufficient for determination of efficacy in IC paediatric patients. 
See section 6.3. of this AR for discussion on appropriate dosage as assessed based on the PK/PD and disease 
modelling results. 
6.3.4 Safety 
Safety data from studies NV25719 and NV20234 are presented by the MAH for the 46 oseltamivir-treated 
safety-evaluable IC paediatric patients with influenza: 39 children and 7 adolescents. All subjects who 
received at least one dose of treatment and had a safety assessment performed post randomization were 
included in the safety evaluation. The summary of the safety population is given Table 6.3.4.1.

Table 6.3.4.1 Summary of studies contributing to safety evaluation 
The background conditions of the pooled safety population of children are given in Table 6.3.4.2. Notably, 
85% of the children had haematological malignancy.  
The background conditions of the 7 adolescents from study NV20234 are not given separately in the Clinical 
overview or Summary of clinical safety. However, the overall numbers of background conditions among the 
16 patients <18 years in the safety population from NV20234 were the following: haematologic 
malignancies 6, systemic immunosuppressive therapy 6, HIV (WITH CD4 count <500/mm3) 3, transplant 3 
(HSCT 2, SOT 1).

Adolescents  13 to <18 years of age 
Of the 7 oseltamivir-treated adolescents aged 13 to <18 years (3 in the conventional dose group and 4 in 
the double dose group) who were evaluated for safety, all 3 patients in the conventional dose group and 1 
patient in the double dose group reported at least 1 adverse event (AE) during the study period. There was 
a higher number of reported AEs in the conventional dose group (6 AEs: one of each of the following: 
diarrhoea, vomiting, joint effusion, bradycardia, pyrexia, somnolence) compared with the double dose group 
(2 AEs: nausea 1, juvenile idiopathic arthritis 1). All these events were mild to moderate in intensity. No 
severe or life-threatening events were reported in this age group. 
All AEs reported were considered unrelated to study drug by the investigator, except for 1 event in the 
double dose group, which was considered probably related (nausea). 
Children <13 years of age 
Of the 39 IC children exposed to oseltamivir in Studies NV25719 and NV20234, 34 completed treatment 
(5-20 days in Study NV25719 and 10 days in Study NV20234). The patient disposition of the pooled safety 
population of children below 13 years of age is presented in Table 6.3.4.3. 
In Study NV25719, 15 patients received conventional dose and 15 received triple dose and in Study 
NV20234, 4 patients received conventional dose and 5 received double dose. Hence, in the pooled safety 
population, a total of 19 patients received conventional dose and 20 patients received a higher dose (i.e., 
double or triple dose). 
Table 6.3.4.3 Patient disposition (pooled safety population, children) 
In the pooled safety population of IC children (Study NV25719 and NV20234), 188 on- or off-treatment AEs 
were reported in 31 patients (79.5%) (Table 6.3.4.4). Fourteen patients (35.9%) experienced on- or 
off-treatment SAEs.

Table 6.3.4.4 Overall incidence of all AEs (on and off treatment) (pooled safety population, children <13 
years) 
Common adverse events 
On-treatment AEs 
The percentage of IC children reporting AEs was lower in patients treated with standard dose (13/19, 77%) 
compared with those who received double or triple dose (17/20, 85%), however the difference was due to 
only 4 patients. 
The 3 most common system organ classes (SOC) in which AEs were reported in children were 
Gastrointestinal disorders (37 events in 22 patients [56.4%], Blood and lymphatic system disorders (13 
events in 10 patients [25.6%]) and Infections and infestations (10 events in 7 patients [17.9%]). 
The most frequently reported individual preferred term (PT) was vomiting (11 patients [28.2%]), followed 
by anaemia (5 patients [12.8%]), and abdominal pain and diarrhoea (4 patients [10.3%] each); no other 
individual PT was reported in more than 10% of patients overall in the pooled population. 
Most of the on-treatment AEs were mild (n=24) or moderate (n=14) in intensity. No life-threatening events 
were reported and only 5 events were considered severe (neutropenia in 2 patients and thrombocytopenia, 
influenza and hallucination in 1 patient each). Four patients experienced 5 on-treatment AEs that were 
considered as having a possible relationship to study treatment by the investigator: 3 events of vomiting, 1 
event of abdominal pain and 1 event of nausea. 
When the frequency of AEs was compared to historical pooled population of OwH children, some differences 
were observed. Frequency of vomiting (included in the SmPC of Tamiflu) was higher (28.2%) in the IC 
children than in OwH children (15.2%) as expected in a population where 85% have underlying 
haematological conditions and many were receiving chemotherapy, antibiotics or non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  
Anaemia is not listed in the AEs in the SmPC of Tamiflu, and was reported for 1/851 (0.1 %) of subjects in 
the OwH pooled children and 5/39 (12.8%) of the pooled IC children. Anaemia is however an expectable 
finding in a population where 85% of subjects have leukaemia.  
Abdominal pain is a labelled ADR with a frequency of common (≥1% - <10%) which was reported in 10.3% 
of the pooled population of IC children as compared to 3.3% in OwH children treated with oseltamivir (Table 
9). All events were reported as mild or moderate, all but one in the triple dose group (moderate and 
resolved) were assessed as not related to oseltamivir by the investigator, and in 3 of the 5 cases, abdominal 
pain occurred in concomitance with diarrhoea, constipation or vomiting. (Table 6.3.4.5) 
Assessment report  
EMEA/H/C/000402/II/0142 
Page 78/118 
 
  
  
 
None of these events were serious. All events resolved without requiring treatment discontinuation, except 
for one mild event of abdominal pain in the conventional dose group, which was reported as not resolved. 
Table 6.3.4.5. Most frequent on-treatment AEs in IC children from studies NV20234 +NV25719 compared 
with OwH Children in clinical trials in SmPC and IC Adult NV20234 Data 
The proportion of subjects with AEs was higher (76.9%) in the pooled paediatric subset than in adult IC 
patients from NV20234 (42.7%) (Table 6.3.4.5).There was a marked difference in reports on vomiting and 
anaemia, obviously reflecting the high prevalence of haematological malignancies and chemotherapy in the 
children. Differences in percentages of patients with AEs also reflect chance within the small numbers of 
paediatric subjects (e.g. in NV25719, anaemia was reported for 4 patients in the conventional dose arm and 
1 patient in the triple dose arm of the study.) 
Deaths and serious adverse events (SAEs) 
No deaths were reported in the IC children recruited in Study NV25719 or Study NV20234. 
In the pooled paediatric analyses, 14 patients (35.9%) experienced a total of 20 SAEs. Four events in were 
in the Infections and infestations SOC, 3 events (in 1 patient) were in the General disorders and 
administration site conditions SOC, 3 events were in the Blood and lymphatic system disorders, 2 events (in 
1 patient) were in the Investigations SOC, and 2 events (in 1 patient) were in the Eye disorders SOC. All 
other events were single events spread across 5 SOCs. By individual PT, the only SAEs reported more than 
once were pyrexia (3 patients [7.7%]) and febrile neutropenia (2 patients [5.1%]). All SAEs were considered 
unrelated to treatment and all had resolved except for one event of febrile neutropenia. 
In Study NV25719, 7/15 patients [46.7%] reported 11 SAEs in the conventional dose group and 5/15 
patients [33.3%] reported 7 SAEs in the triple dose group). In Study NV20234, 2 children reported SAEs 
(oral herpes in 1 patient in the conventional dose group and thrombocytopenia [of severe intensity] in 1 
patient in the double-dose group). 
Adverse reactions of special interest 
Graft-vs-host disease (GvHD) was defined in the protocol as an AE of special interest for patients who had 
undergone transplantation. In Study NV25719, 2 GvHD events were reported (one serious and one 
non-serious), both events in the same patient. These events were considered by the investigator to be 
unrelated to oseltamivir. In Study NV20234, none of the transplant patients experienced tissue rejection 
and/or GvHD during the study. 
Assessment report  
EMEA/H/C/000402/II/0142 
Page 79/118 
 
  
  
 
Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation 
In Study NV25719, no patients withdrew treatment due to an AE. In Study NV20234, one 8-year old boy in 
the double dose group experienced an AE of hallucination that led to withdrawal of study treatment. He 
received a total of 2 doses of study treatment prior to discontinuation. The investigator considered the event 
of hallucination to be possibly related to study treatment. The event resolved on the same day. 
Analysis of AEs by organ system or syndrome 
A detailed analysis was performed of all AEs occurring in Study NV25719 and in children in Study NV20234 
reported under the categories of the identified important risks for oseltamivir, as per the approved EU 
RMP/PBRER, i.e. the following important identified risks: neuropsychiatric events, skin disorders, 
gastrointestinal bleeding and haemorrhagic colitis, hepatobiliary disorders, development of 
oseltamivir-induced viral resistance (table 6.3.4.6). No new relevant safety information was identified. 
Table 6.3.4.6 Summary of all AEs reported for IC children in Study NV25719 and Study NV20234 presented 
under the categories of the important identified risks for oseltamivir 
There were no relevant changes from baseline in vital signs. 
Assessor’s comment 
The AE data do not contain any new findings on safety of oseltamivir treatment that would warrant changing 
the Product Information. 
Assessment report  
EMEA/H/C/000402/II/0142 
Page 80/118 
 
  
  
 
No relevant difference in the frequency of AEs is seen between conventional and higher (double or triple) 
daily dose. The overall incidence of AEs was clearly higher in IC children that healthy controls, obviously due 
to the serious background conditions and concomitant medications in this severely ill population. 
Secondary Illnesses/Complications 
In Study NV25719, an analysis was performed of the frequency and/or duration of influenza-associated 
complications: length of hospital stay, length of intensive care unit stay, length of time on ventilator, 
frequency and duration of oxygen use, frequency of secondary bacterial infections. No patients were 
admitted to the intensive care unit or required ventilator support. For the other complications analysed, 
non-remarkable differences were observed between treatment groups. 
In Study NV25719, none of the patients in the conventional dose group reported secondary bacterial 
infections. Two patients (13.3%) in the triple dose group who reported secondary bacterial infections; there 
was 1 on-treatment event of bronchitis and 1 off-treatment event of sinusitis, which was also an SAE. In 
Study NV20234, none of the children (n=9) experienced a secondary illness. 
Assessor’s comment 
Somewhat  unexpectedly,  there  were  only  two  secondary  bacterial  infections  (one  bronchitis  and  one 
sinusitis) in the pooled paediatric dataset, even though the patients were seriously ill IC subjects. This may 
in part be due to attenuated inflammatory response caused by influenza in IC patients. 
Safety analysis by exposure 
A safety analysis by exposure (in terms of Cmax and AUC for both oseltamivir and OC) was also undertaken 
in Study NV25719. This safety analysis included 26 study patients (14 patients in the conventional and 12 in 
the triple dose groups) for whom exposure metrics were available. Safety analyses by exposure focused on 
the incidence and severity of on-treatment AEs and on influenza-associated complications. 
Study patients were grouped by exposure, defined by both Cmax and AUC being either below (low exposure 
group) or above (high exposure group) the median of the predicted Cmax and AUC for both oseltamivir and 
OC. 
Nine of 13 patients (69.2%) in the low exposure group and 12 of 13 patients (92.3%) in the high exposure 
group experienced at least 1 on-treatment AE based on the oseltamivir exposure grouping. The same 
incidences of on-treatment AEs were observed in the OC exposure groups. 
The 3 most common on-treatment AEs by PT were  
•  Vomiting: 4 patients (30.8%) each based on both oseltamivir and OC exposure; 
•  Anaemia: 4 patients (30.8%) vs. 1 patient (7.7%) based on oseltamivir exposure; 2 patients 
(15.4%) vs. 3 patients (23.1%) based on OC exposure. 
•  Abdominal pain: 2 patients (15.4%) each based on oseltamivir exposure; 1 patient (7.7%) vs. 3 
patients (23.1%) based on OC exposure. 
Out of a total of 14 post-baseline hospitalizations, 3 hospitalizations occurred in 2 patients in the low OC 
exposure group and 11 hospitalizations occurred in 6 patients in the high OC exposure group. 
These analyses were not conducted in Study NV20234 as they were not part of the Statistical Analysis Plan. 
Assessor’s comment 
The MAH states that no clinically meaningful differences were noted between high and low exposure groups 
as well as with the corresponding dose groups, as the numerical imbalances between exposure groups were

Page 81/118 
 
  
  
driven by single AEs shifting from one group to another based on either oseltamivir or OC exposure. This can 
be agreed upon. 
Overall, no new safety concerns based on exposure were identified in the analysis of Study NV25719. 
Post-marketing safety experience 
The MAH conducted a safety analysis based on the post-marketing experience with oseltamivir in IC patients 
<13 years of age for the cumulative data reported in the MAH’s global safety database with a cut-off date of 
20 September 2018. Cases from clinical trials NV20234 and NV25719 were excluded from the database 
search.   
A total of 56 cases reporting 169 AEs (of which 72.8% were serious) in IC patients aged <13 years were 
retrieved from the company global safety database. The most frequently affected SOCs in these patients < 
13 years of age were as follows: 
•         General disorders and administration site conditions (61 [36.1%] AEs), with the most commonly 
reported AEs being drug ineffective (27), drug resistance (25) and pyrexia (3). 
•         Infections and infestations (35 [20.7%] AEs), with the most commonly reported AEs being pathogen 
resistance (13), pneumonia (3) and sepsis (3) 
•         Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (24 [14.2%] AEs) with the most commonly reported 
AEs being respiratory failure (5), rhinorrhoea (4) and cough (3). 
•         Investigations (17 [10.1%] AEs) with the most commonly reported AEs being white blood cell count 
decreased (4), neutrophil count decreased (3) and platelet count decreased (2). 
A total of 15 AEs (8.9%) in 9 cases reported a fatal outcome. The most commonly reported AEs with fatal 
outcome were drug ineffective (3 AEs), pathogen resistance (3 AEs), and respiratory failure (2 AEs).The 
remaining   seven events were single events of acute respiratory distress, death, encephalitis, 
gastrointestinal haemorrhage, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, sepsis and respiratory distress. All 
events reported were either expected complications of influenza that may result in death or were 
confounded by the patients’ underlying immunocompromised status and were not related to treatment with 
oseltamivir. The MAH states that the data on viral resistance reviewed periodically did not identify any new 
safety concern or significant changes to oseltamivir risk management and labelling. 
According to the MAH, the post-marketing data retrieved from the company safety database pertaining to IC 
children patients were consistent with known safety profile of oseltamivir and/or were anticipated in this 
population. 
Assessor’s comment 
Drug ineffective, drug resistance and pathogen resistance were frequently reported in this population. The 
relatively scarce postmarketing safety data do not contain signs that would warrant additional PhV measures 
or changes to the Product Information. 
6.4 Discussion 
The interventional studies NV20234 and NV25719 have been carried out to establish the oseltamivir dose 
recommendation for the treatment of immunocompromised (IC) children with influenza. Both studies 
compared the conventional dose of oseltamivir with higher doses: in study NV20234 the conventional dose 
was compared with the double dose of oseltamivir and in the study NV25719 with triple dose.

The clinical study reports of these studies have already been assessed in previous procedures 
(EMA/H/C/402/P46/105, EMA/H/C/402/ P46/106). However, new descriptive and partly pooled data on 
paediatric subjects have been submitted by the MAH and are therefore included in this AR. 
The dose recommendation for IC adults was accepted based on data from IC adults in study NV20234 and 
PK/PD and disease modelling (EMEA/H/C/000402/II/0136). The recommended posology for IC adults is the 
conventional daily dose of 75 mg BID for an extended duration of 10 days. In adult subjects in study 
NV20234, the time to onset of treatment had (non-significant) effect on treatment response, therefore the 
recommendation for IC adults is to start treatment as soon as feasible. 
The total number of the IC children and adolescents from studies NV20234 and NV25719 was small 
consisting of only 50 patients, 46 of whom received at least one dose of study drug (39 children <13 years 
of age and 7 adolescents aged 13 to 17 years). Efficacy evaluation could only be performed on 20 ITTi 
patients from study NV25719 and 16 mITTi patients from study NV20234; safety was assessed for the 46 
patients. 
There was marked variation in the background conditions in the patients. Patients in study NV25719 (30 
children aged < 13 years) had received induction, consolidation, or re-intensification chemotherapy for a 
haematological malignancy or were undergoing a conditioning regimen either prior to hematopoietic stem 
cell transplant (HSCT) or less than 6 months after HSCT. Study NV20234 included 20 paediatric patients, 16 
of whom received at least one dose of oseltamivir (9 children aged <13 years and 7 adolescents aged 13 to 
17 years). The 22 background conditions causing immunosuppression among the 20 paediatric patients in 
NV20234 were kidney transplant (1), allogenic HSCT (2), HIV with CD4 count <500/mm3 (4),  hematologic 
malignancies (8), and systemic immunosuppressive therapy (7). 
Due to the small number of subjects and variable background conditions and concomitant treatments in 
these severely ill paediatric subjects, efficacy data from these patients should be interpreted with caution. 
Imbalances between groups in study NV25719 increase confounding by background conditions. Time to 
resolution of all symptoms varied highly due to large interindividual variation and small number of patients 
with different underlying IC conditions. No constant pattern favouring a higher dose of oseltamivir for the 
treatment of IC children with influenza was observed. The MAH submitted more detailed data and discussion 
on the patient populations in the two studies with IC children and the CARIFS measure used for assessing 
efficacy of oseltamivir in IC children. Based on the submitted information, it is obvious that the conflicting 
results in time to resolution of symptoms noted in the small studies cannot be considered reliable due to lack 
of power of the studies, considerable variability between study subjects in terms of baseline conditions and 
other characteristics, different influenza strains and unreliability of the CARIFS scale in severely ill subjects.  
It is noteworthy that the MAH has not suggested deleting the statement in the current SmPC that efficacy in 
IC patients has not been firmly confirmed. It is deemed appropriate to keep that sentence in light of the 
scarcity of the clinical data. However, the samples collected from these patients are considered sufficient for 
evaluation of posology based on population PK analyses, PK/PD evaluation, and disease modelling (see 
Section 6 Clinical Pharmacology aspects and Section 8 Extrapolation of this AR). 
Overall, based mainly on the PK/PD population kinetic report and disease simulation report it could be 
concluded that the conventional daily dose of oseltamivir for IC adults can be extended also to IC children (as 
appropriate for age and weight). Similar to IC adults, a 10-day course is recommended both due to the 
modelling results and also in concordance with the mean duration of oseltamivir treatment in studies 
NV20234 and NV25719.  
There were no new safety signals associated with oseltamivir treatment for influenza in IC children. The 
amount of reported adverse events was higher than in OwH children; but the great majority of adverse 
reactions were not considered by the investigator to be related to oseltamivir. The most frequent adverse

reaction found among IC children was vomiting, which is not unexpected in study population rich with 
haematological malignancies and chemotherapy.  
No need for amending the Product Information of Tamiflu regarding safety was identified. All doses 
(conventional, double and triple) were relatively well tolerated. The MAH implemented all changes to the 
Product Information that were requested during the procedure. The finally submitted SmPC, PL and Labelling 
are considered acceptable.  
7.  Extrapolation 
Extrapolation framework  
The presentation of the extrapolation framework is constructed by the Rapporteur considering the EMA 
guidance (EMA Reflection paper on the use of extrapolation in the development of medicines for paediatrics, 
EMA/189724/2018).  
About the product 
Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is an ethyl ester prodrug that is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after 
oral administration and metabolized in the liver by high capacity carboxylesterases to form oseltamivir 
carboxylate (OC), a potent, stable, and selective inhibitor of influenza A and B neuraminidase enzymes. The 
active form, OC, is excreted unchanged by the kidney via glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion 
by the organic anion transport system. 
Nature of influenza 
Influenza is an acute respiratory infection caused by a virus of the orthomyxoviridae family which occurs in 
three forms, influenza A, B, and C. Influenza virus types A and B cause an acute febrile infection of the 
respiratory tract characterized by the sudden onset of fever, malaise, headaches, myalgias, and cough. 
Although difficult to assess, annual influenza epidemics are thought to result in between 3 and 5 million 
cases of severe illness and between 250,000 and 500,000 deaths every year around the world (WHO 
Influenza. Fact Sheet. 2018, Iuliano et al. Estimates of global seasonal influenza-associated respiratory 
mortality: a modelling study. Lancet 2018; 391, 1285-1300). Influenza can cause serious complications 
resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly in higher-risk populations such as children, the 
elderly, and the immunocompromised. 
Influenza in immunocompromised populations 
Influenza infection is usually a self-limiting condition. However, in immunocompromised and in children 
population, influenza infection can be associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. The presentation 
of influenza is slightly different in IC patients. Although the same upper respiratory symptoms (sore throat, 
nasal symptoms, and/or headache) are usually seen, but also systemic symptoms (fever, myalgia, and 
fatigue) can be reduced or completely absent. The increased morbidity in IC patients is associated with 
increased viral load and increased duration of virus shedding compared to that in healthy patients. In 
otherwise healthy adults, elderly patients, and children, the median duration of viral shedding in untreated 
patients was 3, 4, and 5 days, respectively. In contrast, in a retrospective HSCT study, influenza virus was 
shed in nasopharyngeal secretions (evaluated at least weekly) for a median duration of 7 days (range: 2 to 
37 days). Therefore, a key objective of anti-viral therapy in this population is to reduce the duration of viral 
shedding which in turn should reduce influenza-associated morbidity.

Current therapies of influenza for IC children with influenza 
Two main classes of therapeutics are licensed for treatment of influenza in both the EU and the US: 
adamantane derivatives and neuraminidase inhibitors (ECDC 2016, CDC 2016). Influenza B is resistant to 
adamantane derivatives and these agents are not recommended for influenza treatment (European Centre 
for Disease Prevention and Control. Influenza. 2016, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Influenza 
(flu). 2016.), making neuraminidase inhibitors the preferred option at present. Three neuraminidase 
inhibitors are currently licensed in the EU: zanamivir, peramivir and oseltamivir. Only a small number of IC 
patients have been exposed to inhaled zanamivir and data regarding its safety and efficacy are limited to 
case reports in this population. This paucity of data is reflected in the zanamivir Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC), which states that efficacy and safety has not been demonstrated in IC patients 
(Zanamivir EU SmPC). Intravenous peramivir has been licenced for uncomplicated influenza in 2018. 
Intravenous zanamivir has been licenced for complicated and potentially life-threatening influenza in 2019. 
Development  of  oseltamivir  treatment  in  IC-paediatric  patients  (PIP  and  PDCO  history  with 
extrapolation plan)  
The initial PDCO-opinion adopted in 2009 included only the clinical study NV20234 and the modelling study. 
In 2010 the MAH proposed changes to study NV20234 main design features, based on major recruitment 
issues.  Study NV20234, as per this M01 request, could no longer be a basis for extrapolation to the 
paediatric population, because it was no longer designed to provide efficacy data in adults, or to achieve an 
indication in immunocompromised patients (whether adults or children). Thus, PDCO concluded that a 
controlled study with the paediatric population to establish a paediatric use is still required and it should 
include subsets with well-defined immune system compromise. A new study proposal was required. 
In 2010, the MAH requested a new modification (M02) at PDCO. The content was exactly the same as M01, 
which had received a negative PDCO-opinion. The MAH requested to change the main design features of trial 
NV20234 in immunocompromised children (and adults) from efficacy to safety. Because the modification did 
not include a new proposal to replace study NV20234 as requested by PDCO and the outcome of M01 
disregarded, PDCO issued a negative opinion on M02. In 2011, a modification (M03) was submitted at PDCO; 
however, the changes requested did not impact the IC studies. Changes were for the study in OwH children 
less than 1 year of age.  
In 2011 a paediatric scientific advice was submitted to discuss the new study requested by PDCO in 
immunocompromised patients: NV25719 - an open label, prospective, single arm, multi-centre trial in 100 
paediatric patients with solid organ and non-solid (within 2 years) organ transplantation and with 
haematological malignancy” (EMEA/H/SA/2208/1/2011/PED/II). PDCO and SAWP were in line and in 
agreement for the Final Advice Letter. 
In 2012, the MAH submitted a new modification (M04) at PDCO to remove study NV20234 and replace it by 
Study NV25719 discussed with the SAWP. Because there was no proof of efficacy supported by data, PDCO 
in agreement with SAWP were not in favour of removing the NV20234 study in order to replace it by 
NV25719. However, study NV25719 was added to the PIP. 
In 2013, the MAH submitted a new modification (M05) requesting to remove study NV20234 and to add 
study NV25719. PDCO did not agree to remove NV20234 from the PIP, because it remained open for 
children. However, it was agreed to change the required completion date and to reduce the required patient 
numbers. With regards to study NV25719, this was added to the PIP, with some changes compared to the 
study originally agreed with SAWP (e.g. a smaller sample size), while the source data for extrapolation and 
strategy remained unclear. Considering the changes alongside the PIP history, the PDCO discussed that the 
data from studies NV25719 (now in at least 20 children) and NV20234 (at least 15 children) with 
immunocompromised would not be sufficient to establish the targeted paediatric use in 
Assessment report  
EMEA/H/C/000402/II/0142 
Page 85/118 
 
  
  
immunocompromised children. Therefore, the PDCO required a further study 6 as part of the PIP for the 
targeted indication in immunocompromised children.  
In 2013, the MAH submitted a new modification (M06) at PDCO with regards to NV25719 in order to change 
Study duration for participants, date of initiation and date of completion. PDCO did not support the request. 
In April 2014, Variation 107 was submitted and agreed with the CHMP to change the RMP and retrospective 
changes to have study NV20234 as a safety study.  
In 2014, the MAH requested follow-up scientific advice in particular for studies in the current 
immunocompromised program, NV20234 and NV25719 (EMEA/H/SA/2208/1/FU/1/2014/PED/II); the 
questions were also referred for discussion to the Infectious Disease Working Party and the PDCO. The 
SAWP recommended the MAH to complete the two ongoing studies that will provide safety and efficacy data 
in immunocompromised children and proceed to identify the final dose regimen based on the planned PK/PD 
analyses, taking into account the efficacy data in adults that will come from NV20234. Once the studies were 
completed, the need for an additional study such as Measure 6 could be reconsidered.  
The MAH´s extrapolation plan as presented to the PDCO in the submission material (Annex 9) during the 
latest modification procedure -M10 (current Opinion EMEA-000365-PIP01-08-M10, 29 June 2018) consists 
of data from immunocompetent and immunocompromised adults, immunocompetent and IC paediatric 
patients, and modelling and simulation.” The reduction of evaluable subjects from 20 to 19 in study NV25719 
was also discussed, and, while this might have been agreed, the number was kept at 20 as an additional 
patient was recruited during the procedure. 
Development of oseltamivir treatment in IC adults 
For the treatment of IC adult patients, the recommended dose is 75 mg oseltamivir, orally, BID for 10 days. 
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) endorsed this recommendation within 
variation II/136 (positive opinion dated 15 November 2018). The recommendation for the treatment of IC 
adult patients with influenza was based on a recently completed double blind, randomized, stratified, 
multicentre trial in IC patients with influenza (NV20234) that evaluated conventional dose (75 mg BID) and 
double dose (150 mg BID) of oseltamivir for 10 days.  
The clinical development program of oseltamivir for IC adults with influenza included Population PK 
modelling and disease simulation model; in more detail see previous procedure (variation II/136). The 
purpose of the disease modelling was to characterize the kinetics of naturally occurring influenza infections 
in immunocompromised adult subjects. Data from previous studies were integrated into the model 
previously developed to characterize naturally occurring influenza infections and the treatment effect of 
oseltamivir in immunocompromised adult subjects.  
The model and NV20234-study results showed that doubling the dose in IC-adults did not provide any 
further benefit for the patients; notably the OC-exposure-levels in IC-adults were about 2-fold higher than 
in otherwise healthy adults.  
Extrapolation from adult IC patients to paediatric IC patients 
The clinical data from the oseltamivir IC adults with influenza development programme are considered 
relevant for both adults and paediatrics for the following reasons. Firstly, the nature of the disease 
(influenza) is quite similar among adult and children population, as well quite similar with the same kind of 
underlying conditions. In addition, the clinical efficacy and safety endpoint data from the adult and paediatric 
studies are considered relevant for both adults and the paediatric patients. Similarly to adult IC patients with 
influenza, emphasis is on early diagnosis and antiviral therapy. In addition the mechanism of action of the 
oseltamivir is the same in all treatment groups studied, which further supports the rationale for the 
extrapolation from these adult populations for the target population, that is to say to paediatric IC population 
Assessment report  
EMEA/H/C/000402/II/0142 
Page 86/118 
 
  
  
with influenza. Regarding these similarities, an extrapolation approach by using PK/PD-modelling and 
disease simulation modelling was considered suitable to characterize the clinical profile of oseltamivir 
treatment from adults to children population. 
It is noteworthy, that the overall paediatric development plan of oseltamivir in IC-paediatric patients has 
largely evolved during the years after the initial MA was granted in 2002 (see above for details related to 
oseltamivir paediatric development plan). Initially the PIP included the study NV20234 (a study in IC adults 
and children ≥1 year) in a crucial role to contribute adult efficacy data upon which to base extrapolation via 
PK to children. Some uncertainties however became apparent on this approach of extrapolating overall 
efficacy (treatment benefit) from IC-adults to IC-children, as the MAH changed the primary efficacy endpoint 
of this study (time to resolution of symptoms) into safety/ resistance endpoint due to recruitment problems. 
Not surprisingly, efficacy in IC-adult patients in study NV20234 was not conclusively confirmed, but only a 
trend (the CIs of active compared with placebo controls did overlap; historical controls included age and 
gender matched otherwise healthy adults or “at risk” patients, i.e. those with chronic respiratory or cardiac 
conditions) for reduction in time to resolution of symptoms compared to controls was seen when either of the 
doses (conventional or double) were used. There were several reasons for this, including the relatively small 
sample size (the final sample size being so small that the study was no longer fully powered for efficacy 
demonstration), furthermore, it was not possible to have placebo-arm in the trial due to ethical reasons, but 
the comparison had to be performed against historical controls. It was however concluded that it is 
important to reflect the findings in the SmPC, to inform prescribing physician about the fact that the 
conventional dose (but for longer duration) provides the best benefit/risk balance in the adult IC population, 
however with the warning that efficacy has not been firmly established in IC-patients. 
Thus, during the years additional clinical measures/ studies (PK/PD, safety as main endpoints) have been 
added to the PIP and extrapolation plan. The current PIP/ extrapolation plan (PIP-M10) focuses on 
determining the correct dosing for IC-children using mainly PK/PD-modelling approach.  
In this context, it is important to note that the currently approved SmPC does not preclude use in IC subjects 
in  any  age  group,  but  there  is  no  recommended  dose  for  IC  paediatric  patients.  For  IC  adults,  the 
recommended  posology  is  75  mg  twice  daily  for  10  days.  The  MAH  now  proposes  the  posology  for  IC 
paediatric patients <18 years of age: 75 mg (weight-adjusted in children < 13 years of age) twice daily for 
10  days.  The  proposed  dose  is  the  same  as  in  otherwise  healthy  paediatric  subjects,  but  duration  of 
treatment is prolonged from 5 to 10 days.  
Extrapolation  of  previous  paediatric  and  adult  data  in  immunocompetent  (otherwise  healthy) 
patients, in addition to IC-adult data, to the IC-paediatric population/ proposed posology 
Extrapolation of previous paediatric data and the adult data to the paediatric population was carried out by 
using the PK modelling and the disease simulation modelling, see in more detail section 6 of this AR; the 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate in adult and paediatric population was 
investigated using the population PK modelling approach. The extrapolation plan to determine dosing in IC 
children was endorsed in PIP-M10. 
According to this PIP-M10/ extrapolation plan, approved by the PDCO, the specific steps to determine dosing 
in immunocompromised children were: 
1)  Using  sparse  PK  data  generated  primarily  from  NV25719  together  with  any  paediatric  PK  data 
collected  from  NV20234,  if  necessary,  adapt  and  validate  the  existing  population  PK  model  in 
immunocompetent  paediatric  patients  to  describe  the  disposition  of  oseltamivir  and  OC  in 
immunocompromised children. 
Assessment report  
EMEA/H/C/000402/II/0142 
Page 87/118 
 
  
  
2)  Use model-simulated key exposure parameters, e.g. AUC, across the range of exposures studied in 
NV25719  to  confirm  the  assumption  that  oseltamivir  and  OC  PK  does  not  differ  to  a  clinically 
important extent based solely on immune status.  
Steps 1 and 2 of the plan have been carried out adequately. The observed PK data in IC paediatric patients 
1 to ≤18 years of age were used in population PK modelling and simulations. There was a reasonable number 
(n=22) of children from one to <10 years of age in the dataset. The previously developed PK model “Healthy 
Paediatric and Young Adult Subjects” was selected as the structural model. The final model indicated that in 
IC paediatric subjects ≥10 years of age the apparent clearances of oseltamivir and OC were decreased by 
44.4 % (95%CI: 26.8−62.0%) and 49.1% (95%CI: 34.5−63.8%), respectively, compared to OwH subjects 
in the same age range, whereas in younger children (1 to <10 years) the PK of oseltamivir and OC were 
comparable in IC and OwH subjects. The conducted PK simulations included comparison of predicted 
oseltamivir and OC exposures between IC patients of study NV25719 and OwH patients of study WV15758, 
stratified by age. The results indicated that the predicted OC exposures in paediatric IC subjects ≥10 years 
of age were approximately 2.1−2.2 fold higher than in OwH subjects in the same age range. One IC patient 
with nephrectomy was found to be an outlier, having more than 2 times higher AUC compared with all other 
IC paediatric patients from NV25719 study. When this outlier was excluded, the predicted OC exposures in 
IC patients were approximately 1.7−1.8 fold higher than in OwH subjects. This increase in exposure is 
comparable with that observed in IC adults (see procedure EMEA/H/C/000402/II/0136) and it is not 
expected to be associated with safety problems, taking into account the known safety profile of oseltamivir. 
In IC subjects <10 years of age, the predicted exposures were similar as in otherwise healthy subjects in the 
same age range.  
3)  Examine the relationship between simulated exposure parameters and observed PD measures to 
determine  if  any  PK/PD  relationship  exists.  This  relationship  could  form  the  basis  of  a  dose 
recommendation at least for children up to 13 years and potentially up to 18 years. For adolescents, 
consideration could also be given to adult data from NV20234. 
Step 3 of the plan has been carried out adequately. Relationships between predicted exposure and observed 
PD parameters (e.g. viral shedding and resolution of symptoms) were explored in 22 subjects with PK and 
PD data. No relationships between predicted exposure and viral parameters, such as time to cessation of 
viral shedding and viral titre/load measures were found. Treatment-emergent resistance developed in four 
patients with PK and PD data. There were no differences in exposures between patients that developed and 
did not develop resistance, indicating that higher than conventional dose and higher exposure to OC is not 
expected to decrease the incidence of resistance. Time to resolution of symptoms was the only parameter 
suggesting a potential benefit of a high exposure. This finding should be interpreted with caution because of 
limited number of subjects in the dataset. Furthermore, the collected CARIFS symptom score contains 
several items that are not specific for respiratory tract infections. CARIFS was developed in paediatric 
population that did not have underlying disease requiring daily medication and it is uncertain whether it is 
reliable in immunocompromised children (for further discussion on the scale, see Section 7.2.2 of this AR). 
The results of exposure-response analyses for IC adults of study NV20234 did not suggest any relationships 
between predicted OC exposure and virologic PD parameters or time to resolution of clinical symptoms. The 
overall results of exposure-response analyses did not provide robust evidence to support benefit of higher 
than conventional oseltamivir dose in IC paediatric patients. This is not surprising, because OC trough 
concentrations achieved with conventional dose are above inhibitory concentrations of tested influenza 
strains.   
There were no new safety signals identified in IC children < 18 years of age, who were treated with 
conventional, double or triple dose of oseltamivir in the studies NV20234 and NV25119. The nature and 
severity of AEs were consistent with the established safety profile of oseltamivir. All doses (conventional, 
double and triple) were relatively well tolerated. Hence, it seems justifiable to use all acquired knowledge on 
oseltamivir as a basis for safety characterisation of oseltamivir use in IC-children. However, it has to be 
Assessment report

Page 88/118 
 
  
  
noted that in addition to relatively small number of children in the studies NV20234 and NV25119, there 
were no placebo groups in those studies for ethical reasons. 
Finally, the current Product Information for Tamiflu does not preclude the use in paediatric IC subjects in 
either Section 4.1 Indication or Section 4.3 Contraindications. In Section 4.4, it is however stated “the 
efficacy of oseltamivir in either treatment or prophylaxis of influenza in immunocompromised patients has 
not been firmly established. However, the duration of treatment of influenza in immunocompromised adult 
patients should be 10 days, as there are no studies of a shorter course of oseltamivir in this patient group”. 
Even though the unambiguously conclusive confirmatory efficacy demonstration in IC paediatric and IC adult 
patients is still missing, the Rapporteur is of the opinion that it is important to reflect in the SmPC that based 
on the totality of evidence, there is no benefit in using higher (double or triple) than conventional daily dose 
in any IC paediatric age groups. Nevertheless, the duration of treatment in these patients should be 10 days 
(double the standard duration). This opinion is based on all the evidence from multiple sources in IC adults 
and IC paediatric patients: results from immunocompetent paediatric patients from the original MAA 
confirming efficacy in paediatric patients in general; the mode of action of oseltamivir is expected to be the 
same in IC and non-IC adults and paediatric patients; the exposure levels are similar in IC children compared 
to otherwise healthy children (and in IC adolescents with those of IC adults). Importantly, the trough 
concentrations are above inhibitory concentrations of tested influenza strains in these patients.  
However, related specifically to the extrapolation concept overall, it is important that the SmPC reflects the 
overall setting correctly. Hence, the warning in the SmPC that efficacy has not been firmly established in 
IC-patients should remain.  
In addition, the MAH-proposed text in the Section 5.1 of the SmPC, namely “The pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacodynamic data generated in these studies supported the extrapolation of efficacy data 
interpretation from immunocompromised adults to immunocompromised paediatric patients (<18 years 
old).” is not entirely correct, as the extrapolation exercise has been performed based on the totality of 
evidence, including also immunocompetent adults and children. As the sentence is not deemed important to 
be included for guidance of prescribers, it was proposed to be deleted. Some additional amendments were 
requested in the information in Section 5.2 on exposure in IC patients in comparison with otherwise healthy 
subjects. During assessment of the amended Product Information, some further need for changes was 
identified. These are requested to be performed. 
Overall conclusion 
The MAH´s extrapolation plan concerning the present variation as presented to the PDCO during the latest 
modification procedure of the PIP (EMEA-000365-PIP01-08-M10, 29 June 2018) has focused on determining 
the correct dosing for IC children. Based on the review of the data on PK/PD-modelling, disease simulation 
modelling, safety and efficacy data in IC adults and IC paediatric patients, as well as immunocompetent 
adult and paediatric patients, the Rapporteur considers that the dosing recommendation for the use of 
oseltamivir for IC children with influenza is approvable. The recommended daily dose in IC patients of all 
ages is the same as the corresponding daily dose for otherwise healthy subjects in the respective age 
groups. However, the recommended duration of treatment of influenza with oseltamivir in IC patients is 10 
days instead of the standard duration of 5 days in otherwise healthy subjects.  
Notably, related to extrapolation of data from the source populations, it is important that the warning in the 
SmPC that efficacy has not been firmly established in IC-patients remains; and the MAH does not propose to

The MAH’s reasons for changes (reclassification/removal) to the list of safety concerns: 
The MAH has removed ‘development of oseltamivir -induced viral resistance’,  ‘Exposure during pregnancy’ 
and ‘Treatment of influenza in immunocompromised patients’ from the list of safety concerns and provided 
the reasons as follows: 
“Development of Oseltamivir-Induced Viral Resistance” -important identified risk  
In the MAH’s opinion, Development of oseltamivir-induced viral resistance no longer meets the definition of 
an important safety concern i.e., it does not require additional PV activities or additional risk minimization 
activities or routine risk minimization activities recommending specific clinical measures to address the risk. 
The post-authorization measure (MEA075) that required elucidation of clinical significance of new resistance 
information in IC patients has been fulfilled following submission of final reports from the Influenza 
Resistance Information Study (IRIS; NV20237), Study NV22155, and Study NV20234. Moreover, additional 
Assessment report  
EMEA/H/C/000402/II/0142 
Page 91/118 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
data on resistance in IC paediatric patients has been provided with the submission of the final report of Study 
NV25719. In summary, treatment-emergent oseltamivir resistance was observed in 6 of 29 IC children that 
had no notable impact on the clinical outcomes of influenza. This risk of “Development of 
Oseltamivir-Induced Viral Resistance” for Tamiflu, managed through routine PV activities and risk 
minimization measures, will continue to be evaluated periodically based on new data collected during the 
periodic safety update report (PSUR) reporting interval and presented in Section 16.3 “Evaluation of risks 
and new information” of the PSUR. This is in line with the revised guideline in the GVP Module V (Rev.2), and 
the Explanatory Note to GVP Module VII that states: “the definition in GVP module V should generally not be 
used for the purpose of risk reclassification in the PSUR. As a consequence, the list of safety concerns in the 
RMP and PSUR might differ”. 
“Exposure During Pregnancy” - important potential risk 
In the MAH’s opinion, Exposure during pregnancy no longer meets the definition of an important safety 
concern i.e., it does not require additional PV activities or additional risk minimization activities or routine 
risk minimization activities recommending specific clinical measures to address the risk. The LEG 087 
Assessment Report (dated 9 March 2019) stated that the post-authorization measure was fulfilled. Reviews 
of pregnancy including clinical and post marketing data with review of epidemiology data and relevant 
literature shall be submitted in future periodic reports. The risk of “Exposure during pregnancy” for Tamiflu, 
managed through routine PV activities and risk minimization measures, will continue to be evaluated 
periodically based on new data collected during the PSUR reporting interval and presented in Section 15.1 
“Non-signal related evaluations” of the PSUR. This is in line with the revised guideline in the GVP Module V 
(Rev.2), and the Explanatory Note to GVP Module VII as described above. 
“Treatment of Influenza in Immunocompromised Patients”- missing information: 
In the MAH’s opinion, ‘Treatment of Influenza in immunocompromised patients’ no longer meets the 
definition of an important safety concern i.e., the safety profile of oseltamivir in IC patients does not differ 
from what was characterized in non-IC patients; moreover, this safety concern does not require additional 
PV activities or additional risk minimization activities or routine risk minimization activities recommending 
specific clinical measures to address the risk.  Studies NV20234 and NV25719 are now complete and the final 
reports were submitted on 8 December 2017 (Study NV20234) and on 5 February 2019 (Study NV25719).  
No new safety concerns were identified in these studies in 199 immunocompromised adults and 46 
immunocompromised paediatric patients (aged  18 years). 
Rapporteur’s comments: 
The updated RMP v 19 was submitted in support of a type II variation on guidance for use in 
immunocompromised paediatric patients with influenza following the completion of the paediatric studies 
NV20234 and NV25719 and downstream population PK and PK/PD analysis which are part of the approved 
Tamiflu Paediatric Investigation plan (PIP). Accordingly, clinical exposure data in the RMP was updated and 
the treatment of influenza in immunocompromised patients was removed from the missing information. The 
other major changes were removal of development of oseltamivir induced viral resistance, and exposure 
during pregnancy from the list of safety concerns.  
The PAM (MEA075) to elucidate clinical significance of new resistance information in IC patients has been 
fulfilled following  the completion  of  the Influenza Resistance  Information Study (IRIS; NV20237), Study 
NV22155, and Study NV20234. Data on resistance in IC paediatric patients has been provided in the final 
report of Study NV25719 (submitted in February 2019). Since the  study NV25719 was completed, there 
were no ongoing additional Phv studies for Tamiflu. Neither additional risk minimization activities are in place 
for  Tamiflu.  Therefore,  the  MAH’s  conclusions  to  remove  safety  concerns  Development  of  oseltamivir 
induced  viral  resistance  and  Treatment  of  influenza  in  immunocompromised  patients  are  endorsed. 
Regarding pregnancy issue, the LEG 087 was recently fulfilled; however, reviews of pregnancy including 
Assessment report  
EMEA/H/C/000402/II/0142 
Page 92/118 
 
  
  
clinical and post marketing data with review of epidemiology data and relevant literature were requested in 
future PSURs. Accordingly, the MAH’s proposal to remove exposure during pregnancy is also endorsed. The 
risks of ‘development of oseltamivir induced viral resistance’ and “Exposure during pregnancy” for Tamiflu 
can  be  managed  through  routine  PV  activities  and  risk  minimization  measures,  and  will  continue  to  be 
evaluated  periodically  based  on  new  data  collected  during  the  PSUR  reporting  interval  and  presented in 
relevant sections of the future PSURs. 
In summary, the removal of development of oseltamivir induced viral resistance, exposure during pregnancy 
and treatment of influenza in immunocompromised patients from the list of safety concerns of the RMP is 
endorsed. Development of oseltamivir induced viral resistance and exposure during pregnancy remain in the 
safety concerns of the PSUR and will be monitored accordingly.  
The RMP v 19 is endorsed. 
During the procedure the MAH has submitted an updated RMP v 19.1, in which information regarding the 12 
mg/ml in powder dosage form, powder for oral suspension and extemporaneous formulation was deleted 
further to the approval issued on 08 October 2019 for procedure EMEA/H/C/000402/IB/0143. In addition 
minor changes in the Section SI.1 including deleting information on treatment option with Baloxavir 
marboxil have been implemented.  
The RMP v 19.1 is approvable.

 The changes to the RMP are acceptable.

9.2 Other concerns 
Clinical aspects 
1. It has been shown in the IC paediatric development programme that there are no major differences in 
viral shedding, development of resistance, or adverse events between the high dose and conventional dose 
groups. However, the Marketing Authorisation of Tamiflu is based on the only clearly established clinical 
benefit, namely its ability to reduce time to resolution of symptoms. Hence, fully acknowledging the small 
number of patients, and large variation in efficacy outcomes in the studies on paediatric IC patients without 
placebo control groups, there seemed to be difference in this parameter between the two studies. In study 
NV25719  with  severely  ill  IC  patients,  the  time  to  resolution  of  symptoms  was  shorter  with  triple  than 
conventional dose, with divergent results from the paediatric (≥1 to <13 years) subgroup of study NV20234 
with less severely IC-patients, where symptoms resolved faster in the conventional dose group than the 
double dose group.  
Therefore, the MAH should further discuss these findings and confirm their view on the benefit/risk balance 
of conventional and higher doses. Primary interest is on 1 to 10 (13) year old patients who achieved lower 
predicted exposure with the conventional dose than IC-adults and IC-adolescents.  
The discussion should include the following points (but not limited to these):  
• 
the validity and reliability of the used symptom score scale (CARIFS) in IC paediatric patients;

• 
reasons  why  the  results  on  time  to  resolution  of  symptoms  were  discrepant  between  the  two 
paediatric studies, including the possibility that the major difference in disease severity of patients 
or the slight difference in time to treatment from onset of symptoms between the two studies played 
a role; 
• 
• 
if there were differences between study arms of NV25719 that might explain the obtained results 
(age, background conditions, concomitant medications, etc.);  
the clinical relevance of the lower predicted OC-concentrations in 1 to 10-year old children compared 
to  IC  adults/IC  adolescents  (although  slightly  higher  than  in  otherwise  healthy  children)  in  this 
context;  
• 
and importance of these “time to resolution of symptoms”-findings in the overall B/R balance. 
3. The MAH should also discuss the posology in children aged 0 to 1 years, for whom the OC concentrations 
in otherwise healthy infants have been higher due to immaturity of kidneys. 
2. The data on selection of resistance in immunocompromised patients cause some concern. 
The MAH should discuss whether the apparently higher risk of selecting for resistance in the 
immunocompromised patients should be highlighted in Section 4.4 of the SmPC (with cross-reference to 
5.1).

Question 1 
It has been shown in the IC pediatric development programme that there are no major differences in viral 
shedding, development of resistance, or adverse events between the high dose and conventional dose 
groups. However, the Marketing Authorization of Tamiflu is based on the only clearly established clinical 
benefit, namely its ability to reduce time to resolution of symptoms. Hence, fully acknowledging the small

The discussion should include the following points (but not limited to these), see in more detail Questions 
1a-1e: 
MAH’s response Q 1 
The strategy agreed with CHMP and PDCO to provide data to support guidance for use of oseltamivir in 
immunocompromised (IC) patients < 18 years, was based on extrapolation from data in adult IC patients. 
The extrapolation approach leveraged population-pharmacokinetic (PK) and exposure-response analyses 
(PK/PD) in immunocompromised [IC] pediatric patients, also taking into account safety and resistance data. 
The extrapolation is based on the more objective measures of PK utilizing blood samples and PD utilizing 
nasal swabs. It was considered by the MAH, CHMP and PDCO that this was a viable approach (CHMP PDCO 
Face-to Face Meeting, 27-Jan-2016). 
Whilst in fully powered efficacy studies, the endpoint of time to resolution of all symptoms (TTRAS) has 
been used as the primary efficacy endpoint in pivotal studies as the key efficacy endpoint in influenza 
trials, as noted in the EMA concept paper (EMA/CHMP/EWP/808940/2016) and supported by the FDA (FDA 
Guidance Document 2011), pediatric efficacy data by symptoms were collected in Studies NV25719 and 
NV20234 only to support the extrapolation strategy. There was no intention in these pediatric data sets to 
power for efficacy endpoints. Symptom data is both subjective and highly variable, and adequately 
powered, blinded studies are needed to draw reliable conclusions with these endpoints. 
Assessment of the MAH response 
It is acknowledged that the PDCO and CHMP agreed that appropriate posology of oseltamivir for 
immunocompromised paediatric patients could be defined based on PK and PK/PD studies since the 
originally planned efficacy study strategy failed due to recruitment problems. The conducted small studies 
were not powered to confirm therapeutic efficacy. 
The endpoint of time to resolution of all symptoms (TTRAS) is in general acceptable. There is however no 
validated measure for TTRAS for IC children or IC subjects in general. See assessment of Q2. 
This is acceptable. The MAH’s justifications for the study strategy are accepted. 
The MAH’s justifications for the study strategy are accepted.  
The issue is resolved. 
Question 1a 
Discussion of the validity and reliability of the used symptom score scale (CARIFS) in IC pediatric patients. 
MAH’s response  
In Study NV20234, 2 different symptoms scales were used, one for adults (≥ 18 years) and adolescents 
(13-17 years) using the symptoms score in Figure 1 and one for children (≤ 12 years) using the Canadian 
Acute Respiratory Infections Scale (CARIFS) scale in Figure 2. Study NV25719 used only the CARIFS scoring 
system due to the age of the children enrolled.

Figure 2 Symptoms Scoring for Children (<12 Years) 
The CARIFS scale (Figure 2) was published in 2000 (Jacobs et al 2000) and was developed because, 
although acute respiratory infection (ARI) is the most frequent clinical syndrome in childhood, there was no 
validated measure of its severity. It was comprised of 3 domains: symptoms (e.g. cough), function (e.g. 
play) and parental impact (e.g. clinginess). It was considered that all 3 domains were critical to assess ARI, 
as young children may not be able to articulate their complaints clearly, and may manifest illness with 
functional problems alone. However, with this approach, only 4 out of the 18 symptoms are specific for 
influenza; the other 14 symptoms are associated with the fatigue and malaise of being ill. Additionally, as the 
scale is used in younger children, it is scored by the caregiver and not the patient, giving rise to more 
subjectivity. 
The scale was developed and evaluated in Canada, in a study of 220 children with ARI. Construct validity was 
assessed by comparing the CARIFS score with physician, nurse, and parental assessment of the child’s 
health. Data were available from 206 children (94%). The CARIFS correlated well with measures of the 
construct (Spearman’s correlations between 0.36 and 0.52). The CARIFS score was used for the pivotal 
oseltamivir study in patients aged 1- 12 year (Study WV15758) and is still in use today, although, as the 
score is nearly 20 years old, it has not been rigorously validated with current methods. 
Whilst CARIFS is generally regarded as a clinically robust scoring system, crucially in the context of IC 
children, patients with underlying illness for which daily medication was taken were excluded from the work 
underpinning the CARIFS. Thus when assessing children < 13 years in Studies NV20234 and NV25719, there 
Assessment report  
EMEA/H/C/000402/II/0142 
Page 97/118 
 
  
  
 
 
 
were potential limitations. In both studies, patients had a serious underlying illness, which was particularly 
true of Study NV25719, in which patients were undergoing active treatment for cancer or hematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation (HSCT). These underlying illnesses are likely to have confounded the CARIFS scale 
assessment of influenza, with a potentially negative impact on its reliability. 
In addition, IC patients often present atypically, due to their IC status. For example, whilst high spiking body 
temperature is characteristic of influenza infection in OWH patients, it can be absent in IC patients. Study 
NV20234 also collected patients’ body temperature to assess fever as an efficacy measure. In the otherwise 
healthy (OwH) population, this is an objective measure of symptoms. However, in the IC population, 
systemic symptoms of influenza can be absent. Indeed, the number of patients under 13 years in Study 
NV20234 who presented with fever any time during the study in the intent-to-treat infected (ITTi) population 
was very small (1 out of 4 in the conventional dose group and 2 out of 5 in the double dose group). In Study 
NV25719, fever was reported as part of the CARIFS scale, but in the ITTi population, only 4 patients out of 
11 in the convention dose group and 4 out of 9 in the triple dose group had fever at baseline. So even the 
more objective measure of symptoms based on fever has limited utility in IC patients. 
Whilst the TTRAS symptoms is a very important efficacy endpoint, it is highly subjective and thus prone to 
high levels of variability, making it most reliable when used in large, powered, blinded efficacy studies that 
take this variability into account. This was not the case in the studies with pediatric patients in this program, 
which was based on an extrapolation approach and enrolled modest numbers of patients (Table 1). 
Table 1 Numbers of Patients Using Each Scoring System (ITTi) 
In conclusion, with the highly variable and subjective endpoint of symptoms measured by the CARIFS scale, 
which had not been validated in an IC population, and a modest sample size, there was a risk of unreliable 
and ambiguous results for TTRAS. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH’s discussion on the CARIFS endpoint is agreed with. Even though the CARIFS scale is useful in 
otherwise healthy paediatric population, it has not been validated in IC population. Since the symptoms 
recorded in the CARIFS may often have been caused by the background conditions of study subjects instead 
of influenza, the score is not considered to be reliable in severely ill paediatric patients, such as many of the 
IC population in studies NV20234 and NV25719. As the studies were furthermore not powered to show 
efficacy, the efficacy results from the studies are not robust and cannot as such be used for defining correct 
dosage for paediatric IC patients. Hence, the extrapolation strategy for defining posology in these patients 
is appropriate, as was already accepted by the PDCO and CHMP. Secondarily, it can be concluded that the 
Assessment report  
EMEA/H/C/000402/II/0142 
Page 98/118 
 
  
  
 
 
results do not confirm efficacy of oseltamivir in paediatric IC patients, which information is correctly given in 
the proposed Product Information. 
 The issue is resolved. 
Question 1b 
Discussion of reasons why the results on time to resolution of symptoms were discrepant between the two 
paediatric studies, including the possibility that the major difference in disease severity of patients or the 
slight difference in time to treatment from onset of symptoms between the two studies played a role. 
MAH’s response  
Differences in study design 
Other than the patient population, there were numerous differences in designs of Studies 
NV25719 and NV20234, which included: disease severity, age, blinding, dose, dose 
duration and symptom scoring scales (Table 2). 
Table 2 Differences in Study Design between NV20234 and NV25719 
Disease severity: The population eligible for Study NV20234 was very broad, and included patients with 
primary and secondary immunodeficiency, with a wide range of severity. Study NV25719 enrolled a narrow 
population, including only severely IC children who were undergoing active treatment for hematological 
malignancy or immediately pre- or post-HSCT. Patients eligible for Study NV25719 would also have been 
eligible for Study NV20234. 
Age: The 7 adolescents included in Study NV20234 used the adult symptoms scoring. This had the effect of 
reducing the sample size for efficacy as determined by CARIFS in patients < 13 years to 9 for Study NV20234 
(Table 1). 
Blinding: Study NV20234 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, thereby minimizing the potential for 
bias in the reporting of symptom data. Study NV25719 was open label, which was considered reasonable for 
a PK/PD study with objective primary endpoints measured from blood and nasal swab samples. However, 
the open-label design of Study NV25719 could potentially lead to bias in reporting the subjective symptom 
data. 
Assessment report  
EMEA/H/C/000402/II/0142 
Page 99/118 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Dose and dose duration: the dosing regimen was different between the studies, with Study NV20234 having 
conventional vs double dose given for a fixed duration of 10 days. Study NV25719 compared conventional 
and triple dose for a variable duration of 5-20 days determined by viral shedding. Whilst the adaptive dosing 
in Study NV25719 was considered the best treatment approach for patients, this limited the ability to discern 
between the effects due to dose or treatment duration and made ‘time to’ analyses like TTRAS challenging 
to assess reliably. 
Symptom scoring: children < 13 years used the CARIFS scoring and the reliability of this in an IC population 
is discussed in Question 1a. 
However, as the program was based around extrapolation of adult data to pediatrics < 18 years using the 
objective endpoints of PK from blood samples and PD from nasal swabs, it was considered by the MAH, CHMP 
and PDCO that this development plan was a viable approach (CHMP PDCO Face-to Face Meeting, 
27-Jan-2016). However, when considering a highly variable subjective endpoint such as symptoms, the 
differences in study designs could have contributed considerably to the variability in this endpoint. 
Time from symptom onset to start of treatment 
For Studies NV20234 and NV25719 in IC patients, a wide time window of 96 hours between influenza 
symptom onset and first dose of study drug was chosen. This was considerably longer than the 36 hours 
allowed in the pivotal studies with OwH patients. This time window was longer for the IC studies as 
patients typically present later than OwH patients due to their IC status and lack of systemic symptoms, 
and IC patients typically shed virus for longer than OwH ones. However, this longer time window may 
have contributed to the variability in the median time between symptom onset and treatment start 
between the studies (Table 3). The pediatric patients (1-17 years) in Study NV20234 had approximately 
half a day longer between symptom onset and start of treatment (~ 60 hours or 2.5 days) than the adults 
in Study NV20234 and the children < 13 years in Study NV25719 (~ 44 to 55 hours or 2 days). 
Table 3 Median Time from Onset of Symptoms to Start of Treatment in IC Patients 
Although it is well established that earlier treatment with oseltamivir is beneficial, due to the extrapolation 
approach using modest patient numbers, there is a lack of precision in determining the median time 
between onset of symptoms and start of treatment. This is illustrated in Figure 3, where in the conventional 
dose group of Study NV25719, the distribution of the three values closest to the median for ‘time from 
onset of symptoms to first treatment’ is such that the median could vary between approximately 24 hours 
and 60 hours (Figure 3). Thus the estimate of the median time is likely unreliable.

Page 100/118 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Figure 3 Box Plot of Time from Onset of Symptoms to Start of Treatment 
for Patients in Study NV25179 
It is of note that observed ranges (from onset of symptoms to start of treatment) were similar between the 
different dose groups and studies (8.4 to 20 hours for minimum values and 80 to 94.8 hours for maximum 
ones). 
Conclusion 
In conclusion, the MAH opinion is that variation of the symptoms data in Study NV20234 and Study NV25719 
did not indicate a meaningful difference between the populations due to disease severity or different time 
between symptoms and treatment start. It is more likely that the difference in TTRAS between the studies 
and treatment is due to: variability within and between studies, the open label NV25719 study design which 
potentially lead to bias in symptoms assessment, as well as the small sample size that reduced the precision 
of the median TTRAS by CARIFS (which was not optimized for use in IC patients). 
Assessment of the MAH’s response  
The MAH discusses the differences between studies NV25719 and NV20234, as requested. The severity of 
the background IC conditions, age of study subjects, blinding, dose, dose duration and symptom scoring 
scales were different in the two studies. Furthermore, the studies were not powered to reliably show efficacy 
of oseltamivir, hence, any differences in the efficacy endpoints can also be due to chance. As shown by the 
MAH, there was marked variation in the time from onset of symptoms to onset of treatment, which further 
adds to the variation in efficacy between individual study subjects. It is known from previous studies that 
oseltamivir should be initiated as soon as possible after onset of symptoms for achieving efficacy. Hence, it

is expectable that patients who started treatment as late as up to 96 hours after onset of symptoms may not 
have benefitted from treatment, contrary to patients who started treatment sooner. 
In conclusion, the MAH has sufficiently discussed the inherent differences in the design and conduct of the 
two paediatric studies NV20234 and NV25719, reasons for the observed variability and the discrepancy of 
the results on the main clinical outcome measure TTRAS of the studies NV20234 and NV25719. 
The issue is resolved. 
Question 1c 
Discussion of whether there were differences between study arms of NV25719 that might explain the 
obtained results (age, background conditions, concomitant medications, etc.). 
MAH’s response  
In the ITTi population, the median TTRAS was 179.4 hours (95% confidence interval [CI]: 24.7, NE) in the 
conventional dose group and 34.5 hours (95% CI: 0.0, 84.9) in the triple dose group with wide and 
overlapping CIs (Table 4, Figure 4).

population) 
In order to determine if there were any differences between the study arms that may have contributed to the 
symptoms data, baseline characteristics were investigated (Table 5, Table 6). Patients in the triple dose 
group were younger (mean 3.7 years vs 6.7 years) and more homogeneous in terms of race (77.8% white) 
and underlying malignancy (89.9%) acute lymphoid leukemia. Patients in the conventional dose group were 
predominantly infected with the type B strain, in contrast to the triple dose group, who were mainly infected 
with type A strains.

Table 5 Study NV25719 - Demographic Data and Baseline Characteristics (ITTi population) 
Table 6 Study NV25719 - Summary of Influenza Infection (ITTi population) 
There were 5 patients in the conventional dose group (Patient 10008, Patient 10021, Patient 10030, Patient 
10034 and Patient 10055) driving the longer TTRAS group whose TTRAS were above the median (Figure 5). 
There were some differences between these 5 patients and those who had TTRAS less than the median (1 
patient in the conventional dose group with all symptoms scores <1 at baseline and remaining <1 for at least 
21.5 hours had TTRAS set to missing as per the SAP) (see l_dm_IT and l_cm_SE_CONCOM of CSR 
NV25719). Within the Conventional group, patients with the longer TTRAS vs shorter TTRAS: 
•  were older (mean age 9 years vs years) 
• 
had more baseline symptoms that were a ‘major problem’ (13 symptoms in 2 patients vs 
1 symptom in 1 patient) 
•  were treated with concomitant corticosteroids prior to resolution of all symptoms (4/5

• 
had lower number with acute lymphoid leukemia as the underlying hematological 
condition (2/5 patients vs 4/5 patients) 
However, when comparing the conventional and triple dose, there were patients in the triple dose group who 
did not experience prolonged TTRAS who had similar characteristics to the patients in the conventional 
group with prolonged TTRAS.

Conclusion 
There was considerable variation between the baseline demographics and concomitant treatments of the 
conventional and triple dose in Study NV25719. There are no clear factors that could independently explain 
the difference in TTRAS between the groups. The MAH’s opinion is that the ambiguous TTRAS data are driven 
by the highly variable and subjective endpoint of TTRAS - this may have been exacerbated by the CARIFS 
score not being optimised for IC patients - as well as the modest sample size for this primarily PK/PD study 
where symptom data was never intended to be more than supportive.

Assessment of the MAH’s response  
As expectable, the study arms differed in many aspects that affect therapeutic response. The study was 
very small, with only 5 and 7 subjects in the compared groups.  The mean age of study subjects in the 
triple dose group was 3.7 years (range 2-8 years) vs 6.7 years (range 1-12 years) in the conventional 
dose arm. The inclusion criteria comprised a range on different conditions that were unevenly distributed 
between the study arms: acute lymphatic leukaemia (ALL) in 8/9 subjects in the triple dose group, and 
ALL in 6/10, acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in 3/10 and Non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 1/10 subjects in the 
conventional dose group. Patients in the conventional dose group were predominantly infected with the 
type B strain, whereas in the triple dose group mainly with type A strains. Hence, the baseline 
characteristics of the patients in the conventional dose arm and triple dose arm were not comparable, and 
it is possible that the general condition of the subjects was also variable, even though no information on 
the overall condition at baseline is available.   
It is interesting that the conventional dose group with a higher mean age had less patients with elongated 
TTRAS and the TTRAS was in general longer in older children. In healthy children, age has not been 
associated with duration of influenza symptoms, however, viral shedding has been longer in younger 
subjects in studies conducted on otherwise healthy subjects. On the other hand, interindividual variation 
was very large, and the difference across study groups was driven by three subjects in the conventional 
dose group.  
Even though no definitive conclusion can be drawn for the obtained differential results on resolution of 
influenza in the two groups, the submitted data demonstrate fundamental differences between study 
arms. Therefore, no conclusion is possible on any potential contribution of oseltamivir dose on the 
observed duration of influenza in either group.  
The issue is resolved 
Question 1d 
Discussion of the clinical relevance of the lower predicted OC concentrations in 1 to 10-year old children 
compared to IC adults/IC adolescents (although slightly higher than in otherwise healthy children) in this 
context. 
MAH’s response  
Oseltamivir inhibition of neuraminidase 
In adult IC patients in Study NV20234, there were no notable exposure-response relationships for any of the 
efficacy measures and PD parameters, although the sample size was not large enough to make definitive 
conclusions. This is not overly surprising, as in Study NV20234, the doses tested were 75 and 150 mg and 
exposures from both of these doses were considered to be very close to the maximum effect (at the plateau 
of the exposure-response curve). In adults and pediatric patients, the disease model in IC patients estimated 
a half-maximal effective area under curve (AUC50) of 160 ng*hr/mL which corresponds to a dose of 
approximately 2.2 mg. This is consistent with the low estimated half-maximal effective dose (3.2 mg) for 
oseltamivir in a previously developed disease model in immunocompetent subjects (Kamal et al. 2015). 
Whilst there were some differences in patterns of exposure between IC patients < 10 years and older 
patients, the exposure across all age groups of IC patients investigated (children, adolescents and adults) 
was at least the same as found in OwH populations. Among all 30 IC pediatric patients, the lowest individual 
predicted exposure (Cmin of 84.6 ng/mL for OC) was still above inhibitory concentrations (IC95 values) for 
Assessment report  
EMEA/H/C/000402/II/0142 
Page 106/118 
 
  
  
 
 
 
a range of influenza virus strains (Preclincial Virology Summary, 2000). This level of exposure is anticipated 
to lead to full inhibition of the influenza neuraminidase. 
Pediatric TTRAS by ‘low exposure’ and ‘high exposure’ 
To increase the sample size with the aim to make the assessment more robust, an exploratory combined 
analysis was carried out for pediatric patients < 13 years old, investigating the relationship between TTRAS 
and exposure in Studies NV25719 and NV20234. Patients were included in the analyses if they received 10 
or more doses of oseltamivir. For patients with no PK data collected, population predictions were computed 
from the final pop PK model using patient dose level and individual covariate values. Cmin,OC was highly 
correlated with AUC12h,OC and therefore only one out of the two parameters was investigated further. The 
‘high exposure’ and ‘low exposure’ groups were based on exposure by Cmin of OC, the active metabolite of 
oseltamivir, rather than ‘conventional’ or ‘higher’ dose groups. The low and high exposure groups were split 
at the median value. 
In total, 36 pediatric patients from Studies NV25719 and NV20234 had evaluable PD/efficacy data. As 
symptoms were recorded differently for adolescents (age ≥ 13) in Study NV20234 compared with younger 
children, the data for adolescents were not used in the analysis of TTRAS (including fever). Kaplan-Meier 
plots for time to event endpoints were stratified by patients in low and high exposure categories as well as 
Cox proportional hazards of these endpoints versus Cmin,OC, log(Cmin,OC), and Cmin,OC category (Pop PK 
report 2019). The analysis was performed for 1-10 year olds and 1-12 year olds. 
Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox proportional hazards did not find any notable relationships between exposure 
and TTRAS. The curves of the Kaplan-Meier plots crossed in several places for children up to 12 years (Figure 
6) and 10 years (Figure 7), respectively. 
Clearance of oseltamivir and OC for pediatric patients were similar for IC patients as compared with OwH 
subjects < 10 years. Thus, exposures for IC pediatric patients < 10 years were similar (or slightly higher) as 
compared with OwH subjects of the same age range. In contrast, clearance is higher in OwH adolescents and 
adults compared with IC adolescents and adults. 
The lack of exposure-response relationship in IC pediatric patients was similar to the observation in IC adults 
(Figure 8) by applying the same approach as for IC pediatrics. That means inclusion of patients with no PK 
data collected; population predictions were computed from the final pop PK model using patient dose level 
and individual covariate values, and OwH patients of all ages (including pediatric patients < 1 year). This was 
likely due to the fact that all oseltamivir doses tested were considered at or close to the plateau of the 
exposure-response curve, i.e. already at maximal dose-response level.

Conclusion 
The predicted minimum concentrations of OC at steady-state in all IC children, adolescent and adults with 
conventional dose of oseltamivir were still above inhibitory concentrations of OC and at a therapeutic level 
for a range of influenza virus strains. Furthermore, an exploratory analysis across all the patients up to 12 
years, and also all the patients up to 10 years, in Studies NV25719 and NV20234 showed that no additional 
benefit for TTRAS was seen in patients with higher exposures compared with lower exposures in pediatric IC 
population. A similar analysis in IC adults also reflected no benefit for TTRAS with higher exposure. TTRAS 
data were in agreement with the data for virological endpoints. Thus, it seems that the risk of under-dosing 
of patients aged 1-10 years is minimal. 
The MAH’s conclusion is that the conventional dose is adequate for all age groups of IC patients.

Assessment of the MAH’s response  
Following the dosage that is approved for otherwise healthy children, the observed and predicted serum OC 
levels in IC paediatric patients > 1 year of age are substantially higher than those required for full inhibition 
of the influenza neuraminidase. The Kaplan-Meier curves (Figure 6 and Figure 7) suggested no obvious 
relationships between OC exposure and time to resolution of all symptoms (TTRAS) in IC paediatric patients. 
It is acknowledged that the number of subjects in each group was small (n=11 to n=14). 
It is agreed with the MAH that the risk of under-dosing of paediatric IC patients following the proposed 
posology is minimal. 
The issue is resolved. 
Question 1e 
Discussion of importance of these “time to resolution of symptoms”-findings in the overall B/R balance. 
MAH’s response  
Benefit risk section to summarize Q1 
Pediatric development program and extrapolation approach 
As CHMP states, the Tamiflu Marketing Authorization is based on the only clearly established clinical benefit 
of oseltamivir treatment, namely its ability to reduce time to resolution of symptoms. However, the IC 
pediatric development program in patients < 18 years, as agreed with PDCO and CHMP SAWP, was based on 
a PK and PK/PD extrapolation approach from adult efficacy to pediatrics (CHMP PDCO Face-to Face Meeting). 
There was no attempt by the MAH to power the studies in the PIP to be support standalone efficacy claims 
for pediatrics, as the larger size required would have made such studies unfeasible. 
The CHMP agrees with the MAH position that the IC pediatric development program demonstrated that there 
are no major differences in viral shedding, development of resistance, or adverse events between the high 
dose and conventional dose groups. 
Efficacy by TTRAS 
It is recommended in the EU SmPC that IC adults should receive the conventional 75mg dose of oseltamivir 
for the extended duration of 10 days. Study NV20234 provided the data to support this claim from ~ 150 
patients who received 75 mg or 150 mg BID, where the median TTRAS was similar between the treatment 
arms. 
In the pediatric patients, the symptoms data as measured by TTRAS appear to provide conflicting 
conclusions in terms of relationship between dose and response between Studies NV25719 and NV20234. In 
Study NV25719, TTRAS in patients receiving the triple dose of oseltamivir was considerably shorter than 
those receiving conventional dose, although the open label design lead to potential for bias in symptom 
assessment. In contrast, in patients < 13 years in the double-blind Study NV20234, TTRAS with 
conventional dose was shorter than with double dose. There was not a consistent trend showing a shorter 
TTRAS with increasing dose. This was in line with what was seen in the virology data TTCVS, where there was 
Assessment report  
EMEA/H/C/000402/II/0142 
Page 111/118 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
no PK/PD response between exposure and viral titers. The MAH considers that the difference in TTRAS 
between the studies and treatment arms does not represent a true clinically meaningful difference due to 
underlying disease severity or dose regimen. It is more likely due to the variability within and between the 
studies, which were not designed to investigate treatment effect on symptoms in patients < 18 years, in 
conjunction with the highly variable and subjective symptoms assessment by the CARIFS scale which was 
not optimised in IC patients, and modest patient numbers to support an extrapolation approach. 
Exposure in 1-10 year olds 
To increase the sample size with the aim to make the assessment more robust, an exploratory combined 
analysis was carried out for all PD/efficacy evaluable pediatric patients < 13 years old to investigate the 
relationship between TTRAS by CARIFS and exposure in studies NV25719 and NV20234. A total of 36 
patients were evaluable and PK data were imputed from the pop PK model if not available. The analyses of 
both patients 1- 12 years (Figure 6) and patients 1-10 years (Figure 7) showed that no additional benefit for 
TTRAS was seen in patients with higher exposures of OC (the active metabolite of oseltamivir) compared 
with lower exposures of OC in pediatric IC patients. With the caveat of the modest sample size, these results 
suggest that no additional benefit in TTRAS was seen at exposures higher than those achieved after the 
administration of the conventional dose. The risk of under dosing in this population appears minimal. 
In adults and adolescents, the exposures of OC and oseltamivir were higher in IC patients compared with 
OwH patients. In patients 1-10 years, the exposures in OwH and IC patients were similar. However, the 
concentrations of OC achieved with the conventional dose of oseltmivir in IC children aged 1-10, as well as 
adolescents and adults, are above inhibitory concentrations (IC95 values) of viral neuraminidase. 
Conclusion 
Considering all the evidence submitted in the IC adult and pediatric (< 18 years) filing dossiers, which 
included: safety, resistance, virology, population PK, PK/PD, disease modeling and the extrapolation of 
efficacy from adults to pediatrics, the MAH’s position is that the conventional dose of oseltamivir for an 
extended duration of 10 days offers the best balance of benefit and risk for IC pediatrics < 18 years of age, 
regardless of age and of severity of IC. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response  
Q 1e Discussion of importance of the “time to resolution of symptoms”-findings in the overall B/R balance. 
It is agreed with the MAH that the IC paediatric development program for children and adolescents is not 
sufficient for standalone efficacy claims for these age groups. Hence, the MAH proposes no such claim in 
the Product Information. The obtained results in the small studies were, as the MAH also agrees, 
conflicting regarding dose-response relationship. As separately assessed earlier in this AR (in assessment 
of the MAH’s responses to each question), the results on efficacy are not deemed reliable due to 
considerable variation in background conditions and other baseline characteristics of the paediatric IC 
subjects, unreliability of the CARIFS scale in severely ill patients, and the small size and lack of power of 
the studies. Hence, the results are likely biased by chance and by individual differences between study 
subjects. 
As the MAH states, no consistent trend was seen between dose and duration of illness. As a conclusion, 
the dose recommendation is based on the population PK, PK/PD, disease modelling and extrapolation of 
efficacy from adult to paediatric subjects. Since no certainty prevails of efficacy of oseltamivir in IC 
subjects in general, no extrapolation from IC adults to IC paediatric patients is feasible regarding efficacy. 
Assessment report  
EMEA/H/C/000402/II/0142 
Page 112/118 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
However, the submitted data are considered sufficient for extrapolation of recommended posology from 
IC adults to IC adolescents and children, i.e. conventional daily dose but extended treatment duration of 
10 days. 
The issue is resolved. 
Question 2 
The MAH should also discuss the posology in children aged 0 to 1 years, for whom the OC concentrations in 
otherwise healthy infants have been higher due to immaturity of kidneys. 
MAH’s response Q 2 
A previously described mechanistic population-pharmacokinetic model was developed to predict oseltamivir 
and OC exposures down to neonates accounting for physiological changes during the first 2 years of life (pop 
PK report). The model included data from 13 studies, compromising 436 subjects with normal renal function 
(317 pediatric and 119 adult subjects < 40 years). Renal maturational changes were implemented by 
description of OC clearance with the allometric function of weight and Hill function of postmenstrual age. 
Clearance of oseltamivir and OC for pediatrics were similar for IC patients from Studies NV25719 and 
NV20234, as compared with OwH subjects < 10 years in previous studies. Thus, exposures for IC pediatric 
patients < 10 years were similar (or slightly higher) as compared with OwH subjects of the same age range. 
Based on the above, and as the established population PK model accounts for developmental changes, it is 
predicted that this applies (similar exposures as in OwH subjects) for pediatric patients during their first year 
of life and that an increase in OC concentrations would not provide additional benefit. 
In patients < 1 year, the exposure metrics of OC increased in younger OwH subjects. In the lowest age group 
0-1 month, the predicted median exposure (AUC0-12h) of OC at steady-state were approximately 40% 
higher than in infants aged 9-12 months (Figure 9), which is consistent with renal maturation. However, the 
OC exposure especially in neonates was very variable. Thus, the slightly higher OC AUCs for younger infants 
safeguards from underexposure and subsequent risk of treatment failure. The increase in OC exposure at 
the conventional dose is not considered to alter the safety and tolerability of oseltamivir due to its large 
safety window. In addition, a 3 mg/kg BID regimen across OwH and IC patient populations and across the < 
1 year of age cohort provides less potential medication errors than separate doses for different age cohorts 
(SCP EU <1 yr submission).

Figure 9   Comparison of Predicted Post-hoc Steady-State Oseltamivir Carboxylate AUCs by 
Age following 3 mg/kg BID versus AUCs redicted in Other Populations 
In the IC program, the lack of exposure-response relationship in IC pediatric patients from Studies 
NV25719 and NV20234 (Figure 6 and Figure 7) was similar to the observation in IC adults (Figure 8) and 
OwH patients of all ages (including pediatric patients < 1 year) at similar exposure levels. This was likely 
due to the fact that all oseltamivir doses tested in IC patients were considered at or close to the plateau of 
the exposure-response curve i.e. already at maximal dose-response level. 
Conclusion 
The dose of 3 mg/kg BID in IC infants < 1 year - the same as in OwH infants – is considered to be appropriate 
based on the above mentioned points. However, in the case of the IC infants < 1 year, the duration of the 
treatment should also be extended to 10 days to correspond to that recommended in IC adults, adolescents 
and older children to limit potential viral rebound (Influenza Disease Model Report, 2019). 
Assessment of the MAH’s response  
The available data indicate that OC exposures in IC subjects 1 to <10 years of age are expected to be 
comparable with OwH subjects in the same age range. There are no observed PK data for oseltamivir in IC 
infants < 1 year of age, whereas limited data in OwH infants are available.  
According to the MAH the dose of 3 mg/kg BID in IC infants < 1 year - the same as in OwH infants - is 
considered to be appropriate. However, in the case of the IC infants < 1 year, the duration of the treatment 
should also be extended to 10 days to correspond to that recommended in IC adults, adolescents and older 
children to limit potential viral rebound (Influenza Disease Model Report, 2019). This justification of the MAH 
is acceptable. There are no grounds to recommend altered dose in IC infants < 1 year of age and the 
duration of treatment should be 10 days as in IC older children, adolescents and adults.  
The issue is resolved.

Question 3 
The data on selection of resistance in immunocompromised patients cause some concern. The MAH should 
discuss whether the apparently higher risk of selecting for resistance in the immunocompromised patients 
should be highlighted in Section 4.4 of the SmPC (with cross-reference to 5.1). 
MAH’s response Q 3 
It is documented in the literature that younger children have higher rates of resistance, compared with 
adolescents and adults, this may reflect higher replications rates and/or relativea immaturity of immune 
system in particular extent of prior exposure to influenza infection (Roosenhoff et al. 2019). A pooled 
analysis of clinical trials sponsored by the MAH, with a population mainly comprised of OwH patients, showed 
the higher incidence of resistance in children and especially infants < 1 year (CDS v 16) (Table 7). 
Table 7 Incidence of Oseltamivir Resistance in Clinical Studies from EU SmPC V 16 
Additionally, IC patients are known to have higher incidence of resistance than OwH patients, likely due to 
poorer viral clearance (van der Vries et al. 2013, Alonso et al. 2011, Tramontana et al. 2010, Stephenson et 
al. 2009). In Studies NV25719 and NV20234 in IC adults and children (there were no adolescents with 
resistance) this was also the case, although the small numbers of patients with viral resistance is 
acknowledged. When studies and treatment groups were pooled, IC children had an overall incidence of 
resistance of 20.7%, which is comparable to the 18.31% incidence seen in OWH infants < 1 year. 
Table 8 Incidence of viral resistance in IC patients from Studies NV25719 and NV20234 
Across all age groups in Studies NV20234 and NV25719, patients with virus resistant to oseltamivir tended 
to have longer viral shedding, but all IC children with resistance cleared the influenza infection with no 
notable impact on the clinical outcomes of influenza and without influenza-related complications, e.g. 
secondary bacterial infections.

The MAH proposed to add additional wording regarding post-baseline oseltamivir- resistant virus into 
Section 5.1 ‘Pharmacodynamic properties, Clinical studies’ of the EU SmPC version 16, which was already 
submitted with this variation. 
The MAH does not propose to add additional information to Section 4.4 ‘Special warnings and precautions for 
use’ for the following reasons: 
• 
It is understood by the prescribing community that IC status and younger age both contribute to an 
increased likelihood of oseltamivir viral resistance, but the majority of patients will not develop 
resistance. In fact, in the small number of adolescent patients in these studies, none had resistance, 
and resistance was comparable between IC < 13 year olds and OwH < 1 year olds. 
• 
IC patients will likely benefit from oseltamivir treatment as post-baseline oseltmivir resistance 
typically does not occur until several days after treatment initiation, and these viral species will 
ultimately be cleared by the immune response including in the vast majority of IC patients . 
•  Based on EMA’s EU SmPC Section 4.4 guidance (SmPC training presentation), Section 4.4 aims to 
inform Healthcare professionals on specific risks only and should not be overloaded with other 
information pertaining to common medical practice to avoid diluting important precautions and 
warnings. 
Given that the majority of IC patients did not develop resistance and patients that developed resistance 
resolved their influenza without complications, the MAH does not believe the potential for higher treatment 
emergent resistance in IC patients preclude the use of oseltamivir in these patients or offers a critical factor 
in deciding to treat or not. In fact, IC patients will likely benefit from oseltamivir treatment and additional 
language in the Warnings and precautions section of the label may over-emphasize a potential risk in this 
population. The MAH considers that this point is adequately addressed with the new text proposed as part of 
the SmPC in ‘Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties, Clinical studies, Oseltamivir resistance’ which will, in 
the opinion of the MAH, better inform, physician prescribing practices. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response  
It is known from published literature that younger children have higher incidence of treatment-emergent 
resistance and extended viral shedding compared with adolescents and adults. Similarly, IC subjects have 
already previously been shown to have higher incidence of treatment-emergent resistance than OwH 
patients, likely due to poorer viral clearance. However, similar to earlier trial data e.g. The Influenza 
Resistance Information Study (IRIS, NV20237, see Introduction of this AR), prolonged viral shedding and 
treatment-emergent resistance did not affect the clinical course of influenza compared with subjects without 
prolonged shedding or emergent resistant strains. Across all age groups in studies NV20234 and NV25719, 
patients with virus resistant to oseltamivir tended to have longer viral shedding, but all IC children with 
resistance cleared the influenza infection with no notable impact on the clinical outcomes or complications of

The MAH proposes not to add additional information to Section 4.4 ‘Special warnings and precautions for 
use” and justified this with three reasons: Firstly, it is likely that among the prescribing community this 
aspect is understood. This is probably correct.  Secondly, the MAH states that IC patients will likely benefit 
from oseltamivir treatment as post-baseline oseltamivir resistance typically does not occur until several days 
after treatment initiation, and these viral species will be cleared by the immune response including in the 
majority of IC patients. This justification is somewhat controversial in absence of robust data on clinical 
efficacy of oseltamivir in IC patients. Thirdly, the MAH points out that based on EMA’s EU SmPC Section 4.4 
Assessment report

guidance, Section 4.4 aims to inform Healthcare professionals on specific risks only, and should not be 
overloaded with other information pertaining to common medical practice to avoid diluting important 
precautions and warnings. The Rapporteur agrees that, according to the SmPC guideline, information on a 
specific risk should be given in section 4.4 only when the risk leads to a precaution for use or when 
healthcare professionals have to be warned of this risk. Since there are no precautions that would be known 
to reduce the risk of treatment-emergent resistance in IC subjects, any warning in section 4.4 on this issue 
is not regarded warranted. 
The Rapporteur agrees with the MAH that this point is adequately addressed with the new text proposed as 
part of the SmPC in ‘Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties, Clinical studies, Oseltamivir resistance’ which 
will better inform the prescribing practitioners.  
The issue is resolved.

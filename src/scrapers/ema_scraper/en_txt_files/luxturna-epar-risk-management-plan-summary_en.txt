Summary of the risk management plan for Luxturna (voretigene 
neparvovec)
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for voretigene neparvovec. 
The RMP details  important risks of Luxturna, how these risks can be minimized, 
and how more information will be obtained about Luxturna’s risks and uncertainties 
(missing information).
Luxturna’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential  information to  healthcare  professionals  and  patients  on  how  Luxturna 
should be used.
This  summary  of  the  RMP  for  Luxturna  should  be  read  in  the  context  of  all  this

Report (EPAR).
including  the  assessment  report  of  the  evaluation  and 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates 
of Luxturna’s RMP.
I. The medicine and what it is used for
Luxturna is authorised for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with vision 
loss  due  to  inherited  retinal  dystrophy  caused  by  confirmed  biallelic  RPE65
mutations  and  who  have  sufficient  viable  retinal  cells.  It  contains  voretigene 
neparvovec as the active substance and it is given by subretinal injection.
Biallelic  mutations  in  the  RPE65 gene  lead  to  inherited  disease  causing  ongoing 
deterioration of the retina. The gene mutation  leads to decreased or lack of the 
activity of the enzyme retinoid isomerohydrolase which is encoded by RPE65 gene 
and  eventually  leads  to  the  accumulation  of  toxic  precursors  and  reduced 
functioning  of  the  cells  in  the  retina.  The  pattern  of  inheritance  is  autosomal 
recessive  i.e.  both  parents  are  carriers  or  have  one  defective  copy  of  the  gene. 
Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is estimated to affect ~1/81,000 of individuals. 
8-16% of these patients are identified as having mutations in the RPE65 gene. The 
condition can affect both children and adults, both male and female and the first 
signs of the condition can appear as soon as 2-3 months of age. The condition is 
usually  diagnosed  within  the  first  few  months  of  life  and  leads  to  severe  visual 
impairment,  abnormal  eye  movements  (nystagmus)  and  will  progress  to  total 
blindness.
Some  patients  with  autosomal  recessive  RPE65 gene  mutations  may  have  been 
diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, which has a more variable age of onset and 
extent  of  vision  loss  than  LCA.  Retinitis  pigmentosa  (RP)  is  estimated  to  affect 
approximately 1/3,500 to 1/4,000 individuals. It is estimated that a range of 1 to 
3% of all patients with RP have underlying genetic mutations in the RPE65 gene. 
The  condition  can  affect  both  children  and  adults,  both  male  and  female.  The 
condition has a more variable age of onset than LCA but similarly leads to severe 
visual  impairment,  abnormal  eye  movements  (nystagmus)  and  will  progress  to 
total  blindness.  There  are  no  other  pharmacological  treatments  approved  for 
RPE65 mutation-associated inherited retinal disease.
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  Luxturna’s  benefits  can  be  found  in 
Luxturna’s EPAR, including  in  its plain-language summary, available on the EMA

II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimize or
further characterize the risks
Important risks of Luxturna, together with measures to minimize such risks and 
the proposed studies for learning more about Luxturna’s risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
 Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, 
in  the  package  leaflet  and  SmPC  addressed  to  patients  and  healthcare 
professionals;
 Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
 The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to 
ensure that the medicine is used correctly;
 The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. 
with or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.
In  the  case  of  Luxturna,  these  measures  are  supplemented  with  additional  risk 
minimization measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below.
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected 
continuously  and  regularly  analysed,  including  PSUR  assessment  so  that 
immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities.
If  important  information  that  may  affect  the  safe  use  of  Luxturna  is  not  yet 
available, it is listed under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A: List of important risks and missing information
Important risks of Luxturna are risks that need special risk management activities 
to further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be 
safely  administered.  Important  risks  can  be  regarded  as  identified  or  potential. 
Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the 
use of Luxturna. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use 
of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not 
been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to 
information on the safety of the medicinal  product that  is currently missing and 
needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

Important identified risk: increased intraocular pressure
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine
Risk factors and risk 
groups
These events have been seen in the clinical trials; Eight of the 41 
(20%) subjects in the clinical program reported an event of 
intraocular pressure (IOP) increased. Overall, 10 (12%) of the 81 
injected eyes had an event of intraocular pressure increased. One 
event was in an uninjected eye. Most were considered related to the 
administration of the product.
In the literature increased IOP is a documented risk with the 
surgical procedure. Studies on eye surgery (vitrectomy) showed the 
incidence of increased IOP after surgery to range from 20-60%. In a 
prospective study in this type of eye surgery (pars plana 
vitrectomy), approximately 60% of patients had an acute IOP rise 
within 48 hours after surgery with no significant difference between 
IOP before and much later after the operation. In a study looking at 
data retrospectively on 111 eyes, after an average follow up of 49 
months, there was no long term increase in IOP following eye 
surgery (pars plana vitrectomy).
Presence  or  history  of  glaucoma  or  elevated  intraocular  pressure. 
Incorrect administration technique.
Raised IOP has also been associated with prolonged topical as well as 
systemic steroid use.

Important identified risk: retinal tear
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine
These events have been seen in the clinical trials and were 
considered related to the administration procedure. Four of 81 (5%) 
eyes in 4 of 41 (10%) subjects administered voretigene neparvovec 
in the clinical program had a retinal tear, all of which were repaired 
during the administration procedure.
In the literature, it is documented that retinal tears are a significant 
complication of eye surgery (vitrectomy) with an incidence of about 
5%-15%, with retinal detachment after the surgery occurring in 2-
4% of affected eyes.
Risk factors and risk 
groups
Risk  factors  include  myopia,  lattice  degeneration,  previous  eye 
surgery, and trauma. Incorrect administration procedure technique.

Important identified risk: macular disorders
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine
These events have been seen in clinical trials. Overall, 10 (12%) of 
81 eyes administered Luxturna in 7 (17%) of 41 subjects in the 
clinical program reported events grouped as macular disorders 
(mapped to PT Eye disorder [foveal dehiscence], Macular hole, 
Macular degeneration [macular thinning], Maculopathy, and Retinal 
disorder [foveal thinning and loss of foveal function]). All events 
were considered related to the procedure and none were considered 
related to the product.
From the literature a study of 45 patients undergoing eye surgery 
(pars plana vitrectomy) for fibrous covering of the macula due to 
unknown cause (idiopathic retinal membrane) one patient developed 
macular hole 6 months post-operatively. Wrinkling on the surface of 
the retina after vitrectomy for retinal detachment has been reported 
in 9-13% of eyes.
Studies with subretinal administration of a similar viral vector, one 
group reported a measured thinning of the central macula after 
delivery of the vector, including 6 of 12 subjects with sustained 
reduction in macular thickness, through the last assessment at 24 or 
36 months. Another group reported two out of 15 subjects with 
notable examples of foveal thinning in the short-term. Long-term 
follow-up in one of these two subjects showed that foveal thinning 
was still present at 24 months post subretinal administration. A third 
group reported minimal thinning observed within the first few 
months following treatment and remained stable throughout follow-
up at 1 or more than 2 years.
Risk factors and risk 
groups
Risks  include  underlying  retinal  disorder,  aging  and vitreomacular 
traction. Incorrect administration procedure technique.

Important identified risk: cataract
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine
These events have been seen in clinical trials. Cataract was reported 
in 21 (26%) of 81 eyes in 13 (32%) of 41 subjects in the clinical 
program. Of these, 18 events in 18 eyes were assessed as related to 
the subretinal administration procedure.
Patients with hereditary retinal degeneration have a higher 
incidence of cataract formation and at a younger age. In a study 
describing the natural history of retinal degenerative disease in 
individuals with autosomal recessive mutations in the RPE65 gene, 
cataracts or other cloudiness of the lens were seen in at least one 
eye in 14 (20.0%) subjects: 11 (78.5%) had bilateral lens 
abnormalities, 2 subjects had lens abnormalities in only the right 
eye and one subject had a lens abnormality in only the left eye. The 
average age of subjects at the time of first lens abnormality was 26 
years of age.
After vitrectomy surgery, after 6 months, progression of clouding of 
the lens (nuclear sclerotic cataract progression) was seen in 60/74 
(81%) of eyes compared to 13/74 (18%) with no surgery, and 
100% of eyes had progression of cataract after 2 years compared to 
8% of eyes with no surgery.  In a retrospective review of eyes post 
vitrectomy surgery for macular fibrosis, 80/100 eyes developed 
cataract leading to significant problems with vision or had 
undergone cataract extraction compared to 24/100 in the group 
without surgery.
Risk factors and risk

measures
These events have been seen in the clinical trials. Events grouped as 
eye inflammation and/or infection (mapped to PT Eye inflammation) 
was reported in 5 of 81 (6%) eyes in 3 of 41 (7%) subjects in the 
clinical program, including one event in one eye (1/81, 1%) of 
intraocular infection (culture-positive endophthalmitis). All events 
were considered related to the procedure.
In the literature, it is noted that infection inside the eye 
(endophthalmitis) can occur after eye surgery (vitrectomy) for any 
cause, but it is rare. The incidence of endophthalmitis post pars 
plana vitrectomy has been reported to be between 0.03% and 
0.07%. The rate of infection inside the eye after surgery for lens 
implantation was 0.2%.
Risks include incorrect administration procedure technique.

Additional 
pharmacovigilance 
activities
Two (2.5%) of 81 eyes in two (5%) of 41 subjects administered 
voretigene neparvovec in the clinical program had a retinal 
detachment. Both events (one per subject) were assessed as related 
to the subretinal administration procedure. In the literature, in a 
study of 645 eyes undergoing vitrectomy, retinal tears occurred in 
15.2% of eyes intraoperatively, and resulting postoperative retinal 
detachment occurred 1.7% of eyes at a median of 7.5 weeks (range 
3-40 weeks). Another study reported postoperative retinal 
detachment in 4% of 173 eyes undergoing vitrectomy for fibrous 
membrane removal, with a mean time to presentation at 3.75 
months after vitrectomy.
These  events  are  usually  spontaneous  and  cannot  be  predicted. 
Myopia,  lattice  degeneration,  pars  plana  vitrectomy,  trauma,  and 
family history are risk factors for retinal detachment.

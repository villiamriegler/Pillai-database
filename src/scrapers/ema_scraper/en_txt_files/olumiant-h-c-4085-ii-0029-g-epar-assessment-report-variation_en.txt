2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
The claimed therapeutic indication was as follows: 
Alopecia Areata 
Olumiant is indicated for the treatment of severe alopecia areata in adult patients. 
Epidemiology and risk factors 
Both children and adults may develop alopecia areata (AA), and the disorder occurs at similar rates in 
males  and  females  (Strazzulla  LC  et  al.,  2018).  AA  has  a  lifetime  prevalence  of  approximately  2% 
(Wasserman  et  al.  2007;  Islam  et  al.  2015;  Korta  et  al.  2018).  The  mean  age  for  diagnosis  of  AA  is 
predicted to be of 32 years in males and 36 years in females (Mirzoyev SA et al. 2013). 
Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Insights  into  the  immunopathogenesis  of  alopecia  areata  (AA)  began  with  the  recognition  of  the  hair 
follicle as being an immune-privileged site like the eye and testes (Paus et al. 2005). Disruption of this 
immune  privilege  occurs  upon  follicular  influx  by  auto-reactive  CD8+  T  cells,  leading  to  increases  in 
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class I and II antigens and inflammation disrupting hair follicle 
biology  (Islam  et  al.  2015;  Strazzulla  et  al.  2018).  Activation  of  the  pathogenic  T  cells  leads  to  IFNg 
production which contributes both to enhanced MHC class I and II antigens and interleukin-15 (IL 15) 
(Islam et al. 2015; Strazzulla et al. 2018) accompanied by additional cytokines including IL 2, IL-13, IL-
23,  and  thymic  stromal  lymphopoietin  (Suárez-Fariñas  et  al.  2015).  All  these  inflammatory-related 
cytokines are dependent on JAK/STAT signalling, and of note IFNg utilizes JAK1 and JAK2.  
Clinical presentation 
Alopecia  areata  is  an  autoimmune  disease  characterized  by  patches  of  nonscarring  hair  loss.  The 
diagnosis of AA is based upon the appearance of the hair loss. A health care provider will look for the 
characteristic  patterns  of  hair  loss,  such  as  smooth  patches  with  short,  broken-off  hairs  around  the 
borders. Biopsy (the removal of a sample of tissue for study) is usually not necessary. AA is associated 
with  atopic  diseases  such  as  atopic  dermatitis  and  asthma.  Severe  AA  is  recognized  as  a  significant 
autoimmune condition with emotional and psychosocial distress, including high prevalence of depression 
and  anxiety.  Although  up  to  50%  of  patients  who  present  with  patchy  alopecia  areata  experience 
spontaneous hair regrowth within one year, most will relapse months or years after remission.

Management 
There are no centrally approved products for AA. However, some authorized medications are available 
in individual member states (e.g. in NL, methylprednisolone and triamcinolone intra-lesion injections are 
approved for an AA indication). The response to treatment varies widely; few well-designed clinical trials 
have evaluated these therapies. Current guidelines advise on topical (corticosteroids and minoxidil) or 
systemic therapies (corticosteroids, corticosteroid-sparing agents such as cyclosporin and methotrexate, 
and biological such as ustekinumab/Stelara) (European Dermatology Forum (EDF): Evidence-based (S3) 
guideline for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia in women and in men, 2017; British Association of 
Dermatologists  (BAD):  Guidelines  for  the  management  of  alopecia  areata,  2012).  However,  some  of 
those treatments are used off-label. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Baricitinib is an orally available, reversible, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) competitive Janus kinase 
(JAK) inhibitor. Janus kinases are intracellular enzymes that transmit signals arising from cytokine or 
growth factor-receptor interactions on the cellular membrane to influence immune cell functions and 
haematopoiesis. In cell-free isolated enzyme assays, baricitinib demonstrates potency and selectivity 
for JAK1 and JAK2 and less potency for tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2) and JAK3 (Fridman et al. 2010).  
Baricitinib was approved in the EU for the treatment of RA on 15 February 2017 (EMEA/H/C/4085) and 
for AD on 21 October 2020 (EMEA/H/C/004085/II/0016). 
Olumiant (baricitinib) is indicated for: the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis 
in adult patients who have responded inadequately to/are intolerant to disease-modifying anti-
rheumatic drugs; and for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adult patients who 
are candidates for systemic therapy. For both approved indications, the recommended dose is 4-mg 
once daily. A dose of 2-mg is appropriate for patients aged ≥75 or with a history of infections. If 
disease control is reached, patients may be tapered from 4-mg to 2-mg. 
As cytokines involved in the development of AA are dependent on JAK/STAT signalling, baricitinib (a 
JAK inhibitor) shows the potential effect by reinitiating the production of mature terminally 
differentiated follicles at sites of prior inflammation. Animal models support the theory of AA in which 
autoreactive T cells (NKG2D+) drive hair loss by increasing IFNg and inflammatory gene expression 
signatures, as noted above, which could be reversed using JAK inhibition in mice (Xing et al. 2014). 
EMA’s safety committee, PRAC, has started a review of the safety of Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors used 
to treat several chronic inflammatory disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, ulcerative colitis and atopic dermatitis).  
The review was prompted by the final results from a clinical trial (study A3921133) of the JAK inhibitor 
Xeljanz (tofacitinib). The results showed that patients taking Xeljanz for rheumatoid arthritis and who 
were at risk of heart disease were more likely to experience a major cardiovascular problem (such as 
heart attack, stroke or death due to cardiovascular disease) and had a higher risk of developing cancer 
than those treated with medicines belonging to the class of TNF-alpha inhibitors. The study also 
showed that compared with TNF-alpha inhibitors, Xeljanz was associated with a higher risk of death 
due to any cause, serious infections, and blood clots in the lungs and in deep veins (venous 
thromboembolism, VTE).  
In addition, preliminary findings from an observational study involving Olumiant (baricitinib), also 
suggest an increased risk of major cardiovascular problems and VTE in patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis treated with Olumiant compared with those treated with TNF-alpha inhibitors.  
Assessment report  
EMA/572597/2022  
Page 9/138 
 
 
 
 
In the treatment of inflammatory disorders, Olumiant and other JAK inhibitors work in a similar way to 
Xeljanz. PRAC will therefore carry out a review to determine whether these risks are associated with all 
JAK inhibitors authorised in the EU for the treatment of inflammatory disorders and whether the 
marketing authorisations for these medicines should be amended. 
The review of JAK inhibitors in the treatment of inflammatory disorders has been initiated at the 
request of the European Commission (EC) under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and is 
currently on-going.  
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The baricitinib clinical development programme for AA includes 2 pivotal global clinical studies (Study 
I4V-MC-JAHO [JAHO] and Study I4V-MC-JAIR [JAIR]) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of baricitinib 
in adult patients with severe AA defined as ≥50% scalp hair loss. Both studies were outpatient, 
multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials.  
Study JAHO was a Phase 2/3, adaptive, and operationally seamless study. The Phase 2 portion was 
designed to identify up to 2 doses of baricitinib to be evaluated in the Phase 3 portion of the study. 
In the Phase 3 portion of JAHO and Study JAIR, the efficacy and safety of 2-mg/day and 4-mg/day of 
baricitinib were compared to placebo in adult patients with severe AA. This submission includes efficacy 
data for 855 patients enrolled in the Phase 3 AA studies through Week 36 (placebo-controlled period), 
and for 629 patients (approximately 74%) randomised to baricitinib through Week 52. 
No EMA scientific guideline is available for the development of treatments for AA, and no EU scientific 
advice for AA has been sought.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The ERA was complete at time of initial MAA, and the MAH has updated the Predicted Environmental 
Concentrations (PEC) values to include the new indication, resulting in the following PEC, predicted no-
effect concentrations (PNEC) values and ratios: 
Table 1 Baricitinib updated ERA 
The conclusion by the MAH that excretion by humans of baricitinib and its metabolites is not expected 
to result in a significant environmental risk, is endorsed.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Phase 2/3 Study I4V-MC-JAHO (JAHO), evaluated the clinical pharmacology of baricitinib in patients 
with severe AA (that is, scalp hair loss of ≥50%). This study evaluated baricitinib at doses of 1-, 2-, 
and 4-mg once daily (QD) in the Phase 2 portion and 2- and 4-mg QD in the Phase 3 portion of the 
study with a primary endpoint of proportion of patients achieving Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) 
score ≤20 at 36 weeks. A total of 2685 plasma concentration data from 546 patients treated with 
baricitinib and 725 SALT scores from 725 patients enrolled in Study JAHO were included in the PK and 
PK/PD analyses, respectively. 
Methods 
Bioanalytical method 
Baricitinib plasma samples obtained during the studies were analysed using a validated liquid-liquid 
extraction followed by a liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection method 
(validation report: 8232103). Covance Bioanalytical Services, LLC located in Indianapolis, Indiana, 
USA, performed the bioanalytical methods. The lower limit of quantification was 0.20 ng/mL, and the 
upper limit of quantification was 200.00 ng/mL. Samples above the limit of quantification were diluted 
to yield results within the calibrated range (dilution integrity: 10x). The interassay accuracy (% 
relative error) during validation ranged from 0.7% to 3.3%. The interassay precision (% relative 
standard deviation) during validation ranged from 2.0% to 6.3%. Baricitinib was stable for up to 1290 
days when stored at approximately -60 to -80°C.  
A total of 2977 samples (incl. 19 placebo samples) were analysed within 593 days of collection. 32 
samples were reanalysed due to high internal standard (n = 29), interference peak in blank samples (n 
= 1), poor chromatography (n = 1) or missing internal standard (n = 1). During bioanalysis of study 
samples, interassay accuracy (%relative error) and interassay precision (%relative standard deviation) 
ranged from 99.7 to 100.6% and 2.2% to 3.3%, respectively. A total of 204 samples were reanalysed

to assess incurred sample reproducibility. A 100% of repeat and original results were within 20% of 
each other.   
Population pharmacokinetic model 
The objective of the population pharmacokinetic analysis for baricitinib in patients with alopecia areata 
is to support dose selection. Specifically, the analyses aimed to: 
•  Characterise the population pharmacokinetics of baricitinib and estimate the magnitude of 
interpatient variability in baricitinib exposure. 
• 
Identify intrinsic and extrinsic factors that may impact baricitinib exposure. 
The analysis dataset contained data from the phase 2/3 study JAHO in patients with alopecia areata. In 
short, this study was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled adaptive phase 2/3 
study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of baricitinib in adult patients with severe or very severe 
alopecia areata. In phase 2 of the trial, patients were randomised to placebo or baricitinib 1 mg, 2-mg 
or 4-mg once daily. Pharmacokinetic samples were collected at week 0 (0.25 and 1.0h post-dose), 
week 4 (2-4 hours post-dose), week 8 (4-6 hours post-dose) and weeks 12 and 16 (pre-dose).  
A total of 2915 observations from 546 patients from study JAHO were obtained for analysis. However, 
230 observations were excluded due to: below the quantification limit (n = 200, 6.9% of the total 
samples), concentrations prior to first drug administration or within lag time (n = 10), biologically 
implausible concentrations with time from dose greater than 60 hours (n = 14), samples collected after 
PK collection period (n = 4). This resulted in 2685 baricitinib concentrations from 546 in the final 
dataset.  
The structural model consisted of a 2-compartment model with zero-order absorption (including lag 
time) and linear elimination (Figure 1). The pharmacokinetic analysis in patients with alopecia areata 
applied the same model characterizing the PK of baricitinib in healthy volunteers, patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis and atopic dermatitis, and adopted as priors the estimates for parameters and 
covariates from the final PK model for atopic dermatitis. Potentially significant covariates (body weight, 
gender, race and ethnicity and eGFR) were tested individually for their effect on each of the relevant 
model parameters using NONMEM 7.4.2. The criterion for forward inclusion was a p-value no greater 
than 0.01 (Δ6.635 minimum objective function [MOF] for inclusion of one parameter). The variance 
estimate for BSV on the relevant parameter had to decrease by 5% or more for the covariate to be 
retained in the full model. The significance of the potential covariates was evaluated using backward 
elimination (p<0.001 or MOF of 10.828). Continuous covariates used linear, power, or exponential 
models. Categorical covariates used a categorical model.

Figure 1. Schematic representation of the population pharmacokinetic model of baricitinib following 
oral administration 
A visual predictive check (VPC) was performed to ensure that the model maintained fidelity with the 
data (Agoram et al. 2006; Bergstrand et al. 2011). The VPC approach entailed simulating PK data with 
the developed model, taking into account variability in all parameters as given by the residual error 
term. The distributions of simulated concentrations, conditional on the posterior distribution of model 
parameters, were compared to the observed distributions and ensured concordance. Ninety percent 
prediction intervals were computed from these simulated data and examined visually for the fraction of 
observations outside these bounds. 
Model parameters and visual predictive check of the final model are displayed in Table 2 and Figure 2.

Pharmacokinetics in  the target population 
Table 2 shows the key pharmacokinetic parameter estimates in patients with Alopecia Areata using 
individual post hoc parameter estimates from the final population pharmacokinetic model and 
compared with the individual post hoc estimates for the patients with Atopic Dermatitis and 
Rheumatoid Arthritis. 
Table 3. Comparison of Mean (CV%) Population Pharmacokinetic Parameter Estimates in Patients with 
Alopecia Areata, Atopic Dermatitis, and Rheumatoid Arthritis 
The estimated mean CL/F of 11.0 L/h in patients with alopecia areata was similar to that in patients 
with AD (11.2 L/h) and approximately 17% higher than that in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (9.42 
L/h). This was likely due to overall better renal function in patients with alopecia areata and atopic 
dermatitis compared with patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The median baseline eGFR was similar in 
patients with alopecia areata (eGFR=106.2 mL/min/1.73 m2) compared with atopic dermatitis 
(eGFR=108 mL/min/1.73 m2) and was higher than that in patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
(eGFR=90.8 mL/min/1.73 m2).

Based on covariate testing, significant predictors of baricitinib PK included renal function (on CLr/F) 
and body weight and gender (on V1/F). The effect of renal function on the PK of baricitinib in patients 
with alopecia areata was similar to that characterized in patients with rheumatoid and atopic 
dermatitis. Although the covariates of body weight and gender were statistically significant on V1/F, 
the effect size was smaller than the between-subject variability in the AUCτ,ss (55%) and Cmax,ss (23%) 
of baricitinib.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Baricitinib is a selective and reversible inhibitor of Janus kinase (JAK)1 and JAK2. In isolated enzyme 
assays, baricitinib inhibited the activities of JAK1, JAK2, Tyrosine Kinase 2 and JAK3 with IC50 values 
of 5.9, 5.7, 53 and > 400 nM, respectively. 
JAKs are enzymes that transduce intracellular signals from cell surface receptors for a number of 
cytokines and growth factors involved in haematopoiesis, inflammation and immune function. Within 
the intracellular signalling pathway, JAKs phosphorylate and activate signal transducers and activators 
of transcription (STATs), which activate gene expression within the cell. Baricitinib modulates these 
signalling pathways by partially inhibiting JAK1 and JAK2 enzymatic activity, thereby reducing the 
phosphorylation and activation of STATs.. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
In vitro assays indicate that baricitinib is a selective inhibitor of JAKs with potency and selectivity for 
JAK1 and JAK2 and less potency for JAK3 or TYK2 (Fridman et al. 2010). Dual inhibition of JAK1 and 
JAK2, which may interrupt interferon gamma (IFNγ) signaling and other inflammatory pathways that 
contribute to the immunopathogenesis of AA, and clinical evidence with other JAK inhibitors support 
the investigation of baricitinib in the treatment of AA. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
In the E-R analysis using data from phase 2/3 JAIHO study for AA indication, the majority of daily average 
concentration at steady state of dosing (Cav,ss) values in the lower 2 quartiles were from the baricitinib 
2-mg doses, while values in the upper 2 quartiles were comprised mainly of values from the 4-mg dose 
(Figure 3). Clinically relevant higher rates of SALT ≤20 responses were observed at Week 36 in the 2 
upper quartiles of exposure (mean SALT ≤20 response rate for Q3 and Q4 = 0.38) compared with the 2 
lower quartiles (mean SALT ≤20 response rate for Q1 and Q2 = 0.24).

JAHO. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Exposure-response analysis of phase 2/3 JAHO study supports the efficacy of the proposed 2-mg and 
4-mg BD dosing regimen in the AA population. Considering that baricitinib is already approved for RA 
and AD indications, this approach is acceptable for the intended AA indication. Selecting 2-mg and 4-
mg doses for phase 3 studies based on these results is justified.  
Mean apparent clearance (CL/F) and half-life in patients with alopecia areata was 11.0 L/hr 
(CV = 36.0 %) and 15.8 hrs (CV = 35.0 %), respectively. Cmax and AUC at steady state in patients 
with alopecia areata are 0.9-fold those seen in rheumatoid arthritis. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The extent of data provided on the pharmacodynamics of baricitinib for AA indication is acceptable to 
the CHMP. Exposure-response analysis of phase 2/3 JAHO study supports the efficacy of the proposed 
2-mg and 4-mg BD dosing regimen in the AA population. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
A  dose  of  4-mg  is  the  recommended  main  dose  for  the  AD  and  RA  indications.  In  a  Phase  2  study 
conducted in patients with moderate-to-severe AD (Study JAHG), both the 2 and 4-mg doses showed 
Assessment report  
EMA/572597/2022  
Page 17/138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
benefit on the primary and major secondary endpoints, as compared with placebo, and both doses had 
an acceptable safety profile at Week 16. However, the 4-mg dose appeared to demonstrate a more rapid 
benefit (at 4 weeks) on more stringent endpoints, compared to the 2-mg dose. A similar trend between 
the baricitinib 4-mg and 2-mg doses was also observed in patients with RA. Dose-response for the AA 
indication was studied in the ‘phase 2’ part of the JAHO trial. 
Phase 2 part of the Study JAHO 
Based on available data, 3 doses were included in the Phase 2 part of the Study JAHO, including a 1 mg 
dose, to cover the range of exposures where clinical responses could be anticipated. Based on efficacy 
and safety data observed in the Phase 2 portion of Study JAHO, doses of 2- and 4-mg QD were selected 
for the Phase 3 part of the study.  
To determine which dose(s) qualified for investigation in the Phase 3 portion of Study JAHO as well as 
Phase 3 Study JAIR, the MAH conducted an interim analysis once all patients had reached Week 12 or 
discontinued  early  (data  cut-off  date  29  May  2019).  The  MAH  also  analysed  data  from  the  portion  of 
patients who had already reached Week 16 at the time of the interim analysis. After review of available 
data  published  for  other JAK  inhibitors,  the  MAH  selected  SALT30  at  Week  12  and  SALT50  at  Week  16 
(corresponding  to  at  least  30%  and  50%  improvement  of  SALT  score  from  baseline,  respectively)  as 
predictors for the primary endpoint (SALT ≤20 at Week 36). 
Both baricitinib 4-mg and 2-mg demonstrated numerical superiority over placebo and baricitinib 1 mg 
for SALT30 at Week 12 and SALT50 at Week 16. Based upon these results, the MAH chose to investigate 
baricitinib 2-mg and 4-mg, in comparison to placebo, in the Phase 3 portion of Study JAHO and Study 
JAIR.  
At  the  Week  36  (second  interim)  analysis,  baricitinib  2-mg  and  4-mg  demonstrated  a  statistically 
significant  improvement  compared  to  placebo  for  the  primary  endpoint  of  AA-Investigator’s  Global 
Assessment of 0 or 1 with a ≥2-point improvement at Week 36 (Table 4). Results from the secondary 
endpoints were in line with the primary endpoint. Based upon these results, the MAH chose to continue 
to investigate baricitinib 2-mg and 4-mg in Phase 3.

2.4.2.  Main studies 
The baricitinib clinical development programme for AA includes 2 pivotal global clinical studies (Study 
I4V-MC-JAHO [JAHO] and Study I4V-MC-JAIR [JAIR]) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of baricitinib 
Assessment report

in adult patients with severe AA defined as ≥50% scalp hair loss. Both studies were multicentre, 
randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group, and outpatient. 
Data from patients enrolled in the Phase 2 portion of Study JAHO, used for dose-finding, were not 
included in the efficacy analyses of the Phase 3 portion of the study. 
In the Phase 3 portion of JAHO and Study JAIR, the efficacy and safety of 2-mg/day and 4-mg/day of 
baricitinib were compared to placebo in adult patients with severe AA. This submission includes efficacy 
data for 855 patients enrolled in the Phase 3 AA studies through Week 36 (placebo-controlled period), 
and for 629 patients (approximately 74%) randomised to baricitinib through Week 52. 
Studies JAHO and JAIR are ongoing. Efficacy results have been submitted up to week 36 for 100% of 
patients, and week 52 for up to 80% of patients. 
Objectives 
Both ‘phase 3’ studies (Study I4V-MC-JAHO [JAHO] and Study I4V-MC-JAIR [JAIR]) had the same 
primary, secondary and additional objectives.  
Primary objective  
To test the hypothesis that the 4-mg dose or 2-mg dose of baricitinib is superior to placebo in the 
treatment of patients with severe or very severe AA. 
Secondary objectives (Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Treatment Period) 
To compare the efficacy of baricitinib 4-mg or 2-mg to placebo in AA during the double-blind, placebo 
controlled treatment period as measured by physician assessed signs and symptoms of AA 
Other Secondary Objectives (Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Treatment Period) 
To compare the efficacy of baricitinib 4-mg or 2-mg to placebo in AA during the double-blind, placebo 
controlled treatment period as measured by physician assessed signs and symptoms of AA 
To compare the efficacy of baricitinib 4-mg or 2-mg to placebo in AA during the double-blind, placebo 
controlled treatment period as assessed by PRO measures and quality of life tools 
Exploratory Objectives  
May include evaluating the response to baricitinib treatment regimens on clinical measures and PROs. 
These endpoints may include dichotomous endpoints or change from Baseline for the following 
measures: SALT; SALT30; ClinRO Measure for Nail Appearance, Eyebrows, and/or Eyelash Hair Loss; 
PROs for Scalp Hair Assessment, Eyebrows, and Eyelashes; Nail Appearance and Eye Irritation; 
Skindex- 16 AA; SF-36; EQ-5D-5L; and HADS. Assessments of efficacy may be performed beyond 
Week 104 up to Week 200. 
Design 
Study JAHO is an adaptive, operationally seamless, Phase 2/3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, parallel-group, outpatient study. Phase 2 portion has been discussed previously in 
this report. In Phase 3, efficacy and safety of 2-mg dose QD and 4-mg QD doses of baricitinib was 
compared to placebo in adult patients with severe (SALT score of 50 to 94) or very severe (SALT score 
of 95 to 100) scalp AA.

Study JAIR is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group 
study evaluating the efficacy and safety of baricitinib 2-mg once daily and baricitinib 4-mg once daily 
in adult patients with severe (SALT score of 50-94) or very severe (SALT score of 95-100) AA.

Illustration of JAIR study design. 
Both studies were divided into 5 periods. 
•  Period 1: Screening 
o  The Screening Period 
  was between 3 and 35 days prior to Visit 2 (Week 0), and 
 
patients who met all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria 
•  Period 2: Double-Blind Treatment Period (Weeks 0 to 36) 
continued to Visit 2. 
Patients who met all eligibility criteria at Visit 2 (Week 0) were randomized in a 2:2:3 ratio to 
receive 
o placebo QD, 
o baricitinib 2-mg dose QD, or 
o baricitinib 4-mg dose QD. 
•  Period 3: Long-Term Extension 
All  patients  who  have  completed  Study  Period  2  (Week  36)  entered  the  Long-Term  Extension 
Period (up to 68 weeks of additional treatment [Study Period 3]). Patients continued their current 
treatment assignment unless predefined criteria were met for rescue. 
At Week 36: 
o Patients in the placebo treatment arm who had not achieved SALT ≤20 at Week 36, and who 
reach the Week 36 Visit were rescued to baricitinib and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to baricitinib 
2-mg dose or baricitinib 4-mg dose. 
o Patients in the placebo arm who achieved a SALT ≤20 at Week 36 remained on placebo. These 
patients who experienced spontaneous regrowth remained on placebo for the remainder of the 
trial, even if a relapse is observed later during the study. 
o  All  patients  in  the  baricitinib  treatment  arms  continued  in  their  current  treatment  group, 
regardless of their treatment response at Week 36. 
Studies  JAHO  and  JAIR  differed  in  their  design  from  week  52  onwards,  mainly:  randomised 
treatment withdrawal was performed in JAHO, while randomised down-titration was performed 
in JAIR. 
At Week 52 in JAHO: 
Responders: SALT ≤20 
o Patients in baricitinib treatment arms who achieve a SALT ≤20 at Week 52 (responders) were 
eligible  for  randomized  withdrawal,  provided  that  they  have  stayed  on  the  same  dose  of 
baricitinib from initial randomization (Visit 2). 
o  Responders  who  were  rescued  to  baricitinib  at  Week  36,  were  not  eligible  for  randomized 
withdrawal and remained in their same treatment group. 
o Eligible patients were automatically randomized in a blinded manner by the IWRS in a 3:1 ratio 
to  either  stay  on  their  current  dose  of  baricitinib  or  transition  to  placebo  (randomized 
withdrawal). 
o Any patients in the placebo treatment arm at Week 52 who have achieved a SALT ≤20 remained 
on placebo. 
o Responders who experienced a loss of treatment benefit after Week 52 (defined as >20-point 
absolute worsening in total SALT score), and who:

  were  randomized  to  placebo  at  Week  52  (randomized  withdrawal),  will  be 
automatically retreated with their baricitinib dose, as randomized at Baseline (Visit 2). 
 remained on baricitinib at Week 52 (randomized withdrawal), continued to receive the 
same dose of baricitinib. 
 were randomized to placebo at Baseline (Visit 2), remained on placebo. 
Nonresponders: SALT >20 
o Patients who have been in the baricitinib 4-mg treatment group from Baseline AND have never 
achieved a SALT ≤20 by Week 52 AND did not have a ≥2-point improvement from Baseline in 
ClinRO  Measures  for  Eyebrow  or  Eyelash  Hair  Loss  at  Week  52  automatically  transitioned  to 
placebo. 
o Patients who have been in the baricitinib 4-mg treatment group and have achieved a SALT ≤
20 before Week 52 and have lost response, remained on baricitinib 4-mg dose. 
o Those who have been in the baricitinib 2-mg treatment group from Baseline were rescued to 
baricitinib 4-mg. 
o Those who were rescued to baricitinib at Week 36 continued in their current treatment arm at 
Week 52. 
At Week 76: 
o  Patients  who  were  nonresponders  (SALT  >20)  at  Weeks  52  AND  76  were  automatically 
discontinued from the study at Week 76, unless they have a ≥2 point improvement from Baseline 
in ClinRO Measures for Eyebrow or Eyelash Hair Loss. 
At Week 52 in JAIR: 
Responders (SALT ≤20) 
o  Patients  in  the  4-mg  dose  baricitinib  treatment  arm  who  achieve  a  SALT  ≤20  at  Week  52 
(responders) are eligible for randomized downtitration, provided that they have stayed on the 
same dose of baricitinib from initial randomization (Visit 2). 
o Patients who were rescued to baricitinib at Week 36 and patients randomized to 2-mg dose 
baricitinib  will  not  be  eligible  for  randomized  downtitration  and  will  remain  in  their  same 
treatment group. 
o Eligible patients will be automatically randomized in a blinded manner by the interactive web-
response system (IWRS) in a 1:1 ratio to either stay on their current 4-mg dose of baricitinib or 
transition to 2-mg dose of baricitinib (randomized downtitration). 
o Patients in the placebo treatment arm at Week 52 who have achieved a SALT ≤20 will 
remain on placebo. 
o Responders who experience a loss of treatment benefit after Week 52 (defined as >20-point 
absolute worsening in total SALT score), and who: 
    were randomized to 2-mg dose of baricitinib at Week 52 (randomized downtitration), will 
be automatically retreated with the 4-mg dose of baricitinib,as randomized at Baseline (Visit 2). 
    remained on 4-mg dose of baricitinib at Week 52 (randomized downtitration), will continue 
to receive the same dose of baricitinib. 
    were randomized to 2-mg dose at Baseline (Visit 2), will be rescued to 4-mg dose.

    had remained on placebo since Baseline (Visit 2), will be rescued to baricitinib 2-mg. 
Nonresponders (SALT >20) 
o Patients who have been in the baricitinib 4-mg dose treatment group from Baseline AND 
have never achieved a SALT ≤20 by Week 52 AND do not have a ≥2-point improvement 
from Baseline in clinician-reported outcome (ClinRO) measure for eyebrow or eyelash 
hair loss at Week 52 will be automatically transitioned to placebo.

SALT ≤20 before Week 52 and have lost response, will remain on baricitinib 4-mg dose. 
o Those who have been in the baricitinib 2-mg dose treatment group from Baseline will be 
rescued to baricitinib 4-mg dose. 
o Those who were rescued to baricitinib at Week 36 will continue in their current treatment 
arm at Week 52. 
o Those who were randomized to placebo at Baseline and were not eligible for rescue to 
baricitinib at Week 36 (spontaneous remission) will be rescued to baricitinib 2-mg. 
Note: Investigators should consider discontinuing patients who do not present any 
improvement of AA lesions by Week 64 (Visit 14). 
•  Period 4: Bridging Extension in JAHO 
o  Patients  who  have  completed  Week  104  and  have  not  met  criteria  for  permanent 
discontinuation  had  the  possibility  to  remain  in  the  trial  for  up  to  96  additional  weeks  (up  to 
Week 200). 
o During Period 4, patients continued to receive the same treatment they received during Period 
3. 
o Responders who had been randomized to placebo at Week 52 (randomized withdrawal) and 
have  remained  on  placebo,  had  the  possibility  to  be  retreated  with  their  baricitinib  dose  as 
randomized  at  Baseline  (Visit  2)  if  they  experienced  a  loss  of  benefit  (defined  as  >20-point 
absolute worsening in total SALT score). 
Bridging Extension in JAIR 
o  Patients  who  were  randomized  to  placebo  at  Baseline  and  were  not  eligible  for  rescue  to 
baricitinib  at  Week  36  or  during  Period  3  (spontaneous  remission)  will  continue  to  have  the 
opportunity to be rescued to baricitinib 2-mg if they experience loss of treatment benefit. 
o  Baricitinib  4mg  responders  who  had  been  randomized  to  baricitinib  2-mg  at  Week  52 
(randomized downtitration) and have remained on baricitinib 2-mg, will have the possibility to 
be  retreated  with  baricitinib  4-mg  if  they  experience  a  loss  of  benefit  (defined  as  >20-point 
absolute worsening in total SALT score) during Period 4. 
•  Period 5: Post-Treatment Follow-Up 
Assessment report

o Patients who complete the study through Visit 24 (Week 200), had a Post- Treatment Follow-
Up visit (Visit 801) approximately 28 days after the last dose of IP. 
o Patients who have completed Week 200 and who continued on marketed product beyond Week 
200 did not need to complete Period 5 (Visit 801). 
o Patients who have received at least 1 dose of study intervention and discontinued early from 
the study must have an Early Termination visit and return for the Post-Treatment Follow-Up visit 
(Visit 801) approximately 28 days after the last dose of IP. 
Study participants 
Inclusion/Exclusion  
The in/exclusion criteria were similar for the phase 3 portion of Study I4V-MC-JAHO [JAHO] and Study 
I4V-MC-JAIR [JAIR]. To be eligible to participate in the phase 3 studies (JAHO and JAIR), patients must 
have: 
 been at least 18 years of age and ≤60 years of age for males and ≤70 years of age for females 
at the time of informed consent. 
 had severe or very severe AA, as determined by all of the following: 
o current AA episode of more than 6 months’ duration and hair loss encompassing ≥50% 
of the scalp, as measured by SALT (AA-IGA of 3 or 4, corresponding respectively to SALT 
= 50 to 94 and SALT = 95 to 100) at Visit 1 AND Visit 2. 
o no spontaneous improvement (that is, no more than 10-point spontaneous reduction 
in SALT) over the past 6 months. 
o current episode of severe or very severe AA of less than 8 years. 
  Patients  who  have  severe  or  very  severe  AA  for  ≥8  years  may  be  enrolled  if  episodes  of 
regrowth,  spontaneous  or  under  treatment,  have  been  observed  on  the  affected  areas  of  the 
scalp over the past 8 years. 
Patients were excluded from inclusion in the study if they meet the following criteria: 
 had primarily “diffuse” type of AA (characterized by diffuse hair shedding). 
 were currently experiencing other forms of alopecia, or any other concomitant conditions that 
would interfere with evaluations of the effect of study medication on AA. 
 had inadequate washout with the following therapies including but not limited to: 
o corticosteroids 
o JAK inhibitors 
o monoclonal antibodies 
o phototherapy 
o immunosuppressants 
Discontinuation  
The  investigator  discontinued  or  temporarily  interrupted  study  intervention  in  the  following 
circumstances:  laboratory  abnormalities,  pregnancy,  malignancy,  VTE,  hepatitis  B,  use  of  prohibited 
medications, herpes zoster, suicidal ideation, in line with GCP, investigator's decision, enrollment in other 
studies and subject's decision.

Treatments 
Both studies (Study I4V-MC-JAHO [JAHO] and Study I4V-MC-JAIR [JAIR]) incorporated randomization 
and blinding methods to minimize bias. Enrolled patients were randomized in 2:2:3 ratio for 
• 
• 
• 
placebo once daily 
baricitinib 2-mg QD, or 
baricitinib 4-mg QD. 
Table 5 outlines the study intervention(s). 
Table 5 Study Intervention(s) Administered.  
Concomitant Therapy 
The following medications were permitted during the study: 
 topical corticosteroids except on the scalp, eyebrows, and eyelashes 
 topical calcineurin inhibitors except on the scalp, eyebrows, and eyelashes 
 intranasal, ophthalmic, or inhaled steroid use 
 a maximum of 2 intra-articular or soft tissue (bursa, tendon, and/or ligament) corticosteroid 
injections were allowed up until the 36-week primary endpoint. After 36 weeks, such injections 
are permitted 
 non-live vaccinations such as seasonal vaccination, non-live herpes zoster (for subjects who 
become eligible during the trial), and/or all emergency vaccinations such as rabies or tetanus 
vaccinations 
 bimatoprost ophthalmic solution (if on stable dose for 8 weeks prior to randomization) 
 finasteride (or other 5 alpha reductase inhibitors) or oral or topical minoxidil, if on a stable 
dose for 12 months prior to randomization, and 
 HMG CoA reductase inhibitors or “statins” (for example, simvastatin, simvastatin + ezetimibe) 
for treatment of hypercholesterolemia and the prevention of cardiovascular disease. 
Treatment with concomitant therapies for other medical conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension, 
was permitted during the study. 
Rescue treatment 
As explained in the design of trials, non-responders in the placebo group could receive baricitinib as a 
rescue treatment after week 36. Non-responders in low dose treatment groups could be rescued with 4-

Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary and key secondary endpoints were adjusted for multiplicity in both Phase 3 studies (Study 
I4V-MC-JAHO [JAHO] and Study I4V-MC-JAIR [JAIR]). Additional efficacy endpoints were prespecified in 
the study protocols but were not adjusted for multiplicity. 
Primary Efficacy endpoint - Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) 
The SALT score is a tool developed by the National Alopecia Areata Foundation Working Committee to 
assess the extent of scalp hair loss in patients with AA (Olsen et al. 1999, 2004). 
The  SALT  uses  a  visual  aid  showing  the  division  of  the  scalp  hair  into  4  areas,  each  constituting  the 
following percentage of total scalp surface area: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Top - 40%. 
Posterior/back - 24%. 
Right side - 18%. 
Left side - 18%. 
Figure 6 
SALT aid for determining scalp surface area. 
The  percentage  of  hair  loss  in  each  area  is  determined  and  is  multiplied  by  the  percentage  of  scalp 
covered by that area. The total sum of the 4 products of each area will give the SALT score. Only terminal 
hair is included in the SALT when determining scalp coverage; areas with only vellus hair or any fine, 
downy hair are considered as missing hair (Olsen et al. 1999, 2004). 
Assessment report  
EMA/572597/2022  
Page 26/138 
 
 
 
 
 
The primary endpoint for the Phase 3 AA studies is SALT ≤20 at Week 36. This corresponds to scalp hair 
loss of ≤20% or at least 80% scalp hair coverage. According to the study in which SALT was developed, 
this  endpoint  was  considered  by  both  patients  with  AA  and  clinicians  as  a  clinically  meaningful 
improvement for patients with ≥50% scalp hair loss (Wyrwich et al. 2020a). 
Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
-  Additional Severity of Alopecia Tool Assessments 
The AA studies included more stringent SALT assessments (i.e. SALT90 and SALT ≤10 at Week 36) as key 
secondary endpoints. These assessments correspond to at least 90% improvement of SALT score from 
baseline and ≤10% scalp hair loss, respectively. The studies also included SALT assessments at earlier 
timepoints, including SALT ≤20, SALT ≤10 and the less stringent endpoint of SALT50, to investigate the 
onset of treatment benefit. 
-  Scalp Hair Assessment Patient Reported Outcome 
The MAH developed the Scalp Hair Assessment PRO™ to assess the patient’s perception of current extent 
of scalp involvement. The PRO is a 5-point, single-item patient assessment of scalp hair loss severity: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
0 - No missing hair (0% of my scalp is missing hair; I have a full head of hair). 
1 - A limited area (1% to 20% of my scalp is missing hair). 
2 - A moderate area (21% to 49% of my scalp is missing hair). 
3 - A large area (50% to 94% of my scalp is missing hair). 
4 - Nearly all or all (95% to 100% of my scalp is missing hair). 
Because  this  is  a  newly  introduced  outcome  measure,  the  MAH  has  submitted  the  evidence  dossier 
describing  the  development  and  validation  of  this  measure.  The  content  validity  of  the  Scalp  Hair 
Assessment PRO was assessed via qualitative interviews with 10 dermatologists with clinical expertise 
in AA and 45 patients with ≥50% AA-related scalp hair loss (n=30 in Round 1 and n=15 in Round 2). 
The measurement properties of the Scalp Hair Assessment PRO were evaluated using data from JAHO 
and JAIR studies.  The FAS from Studies JAHO (Phase 3 portion) and JAIR were used in the psychometric 
analyses. Data up to and including Week 36 were included. 
Test-retest  reliability  of  the  Scalp  Hair  Assessment  PRO  was  examined  in  a  subset  of  the  analysis 
population who had stable disease status based on their SALT score category at screening and baseline 
visits, with ≥7 to ≤14 days between visits. The Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICCs) observed ranged 
from 0.70 to 0.85, with higher scores indicating better reliability.  
Discriminant  validity  of  the  Scalp  Hair  Assessment  PRO  was  evaluated  using  t-tests  to  distinguish 
scores between subgroups defined on SALT score at baseline (that is, those with a SALT score of 50-94 
versus  95-100).  Patients  with  a  SALT  score  of  95  to  100  had  statistically  significantly  higher  (worse) 
scores  on  the  Scalp  Hair  Assessment  PRO  than  those  reporting  less  severe  hair  loss  of  50%-94%. 
However,  validity  using  the  Skindex-16  Emotions  Domain  score  as  a  reference,  could  only  be 
demonstrated for one of the pivotal trials (JAHO). Furthermore, Scalp Hair Assessment PRO scores were 
not observed to differ significantly between patients with better or worse SF-36v2 Item 1 scores (overall 
health) in either Study JAHO or Study JAIR.  
For  concurrent validity,  it  was  hypothesized  that  moderate  to  large  correlations  would  be  observed 
between  the  Scalp  Hair  Assessment  PRO  and  the  Skindex-16  Emotions  Domain,  and  the  Scalp  Hair 
Assessment PRO and SF-36v2 Item 1 (overall health); however, small to moderate Pearson correlations 
(that is, ≥0.0 to ≤0.4) were observed at all time points in both Phase 3 studies.

Clinical relevance was evaluated in the development study (Wyrwich et al. 2020c). Most of the patients 
in round 1 and round 2 who were asked (34 of 35, 97%) indicated that treatment would be successful if 
they moved from ≥ 50% missing hair at baseline to the‘limited’category (≤ 20% missing hair) on the 
Scalp Hair Assessment PRO. 
Sensitivity to change, was not evaluated in the pivotal trials, no further information on sensitivity was 
provided.

Clinician-Reported Outcomes for Eyebrow Hair Loss and Eyelash Hair Loss 
The MAH developed 2 novel Clinician-reported outcomes (ClinRO) to measure 2 important signs of AA: 
• 
• 
ClinRO Measure for EB Hair Loss™ and 
ClinRO Measure for EL Hair Loss™. 
Both ClinRO Measures use a 4-point response scale (Table 6). 
Table 6 ClinRO measures for Eyebrow and Eyelash hair loss 
Assessment  of  the  test-retest  reliability,  Discriminant  validity  and  convergent  validity  of  the  ClinRO 
Measure for Eyebrow/Eyelashes Hair Loss was investigated in 2 clinical studies, Study JAHO and Study 
JAIR, in patients with severe to very severe AA.  
Test-retest  reliability  of  the  ClinRO  Measure  for  Eyebrow/Eyelashes  Hair  Loss  was  examined  in  a 
subset of the analysis population who had stable disease status based on their SALT score category. The 
ICCs observed ranged from 0.89 to 0.90 in JAHO and JAIR trials for ClinRO Measure of Eyebrow Hair 
Loss.  The  ICCs  observed  for  the  ClinRO  Measure  for  Eyelash  Hair  Loss  were  0.90  in  both  studies, 
indicating good test-retest reliability among stable patients. 
Discriminant validity of the ClinRO Measure for Eyebrow/Eyelashes Hair Loss was evaluated using t-
tests to distinguish scores between subgroups defined on the PRO Measure for Eyebrow/Eyelashes score 
at baseline. Patients with more severe eyebrow hair loss as assessed by the PRO were hypothesized to 
have  significantly  higher  (worse)  scores  on  the  ClinRO  Measure  for  Eyebrow/Eyelashes  Hair  Loss. 
Supplemental analyses using subgroups defined  by the Skindex-16 Emotions Domain score and SALT 
score at baseline were also performed.  
In Study JAIR, patients with low (less than or equal to median) versus high (greater than median) scores 
on the Skindex-16 Emotions Domain Score had significantly higher (worse) scores on the ClinRO Measure 
for Eyebrow Hair Loss according to both primary and sensitivity analyses. However, this was not observed 
in Study JAHO, where there was no statistically significant difference in ClinRO Measure for Eyebrow Hair 
scores between these 2 groups in either the primary or sensitivity analyses. 
Patients with more severe eyelash hair loss (that is, those with a PRO Measure for Eyelashes score of 2 
or 3) had statistically significantly higher (worse) scores on the ClinRO Measure for Eyelash Hair Loss 
Assessment report  
EMA/572597/2022  
Page 28/138 
 
 
 
 
 
than those reporting less severe eyelash hair loss (that is, a PRO Measure for Eyelashes score of 0 or 1). 
Therefore,  in  both  Phase  3  studies,  both  primary  (parametric  t-tests)  and  sensitivity  (nonparametric 
Kruskal-Wallis  tests)  analyses  demonstrated  that  the  ClinRO  Measure  for  Eyelash  Hair  Loss  could 
differentiate significantly between known groups of patients with different severity of eyelash hair loss. 
Additionally, patients with less scalp hair loss as assessed by the SALT (score ≥50 and ≤94) and patients 
with greater than median Skindex-16 Emotions Domain scores had significantly lower (better) scores on 
the ClinRO Measure for Eyelash Hair Loss than those with greater scalp hair loss as assessed by the SALT 
(score ≥95 and ≤100) or less than or equal to median Skindex-16 Emotions Domain scores in both trials 
according to both primary and sensitivity analyses. 
Convergent  validity  was  assessed  by  Pearson  correlations  and  Spearman  rank-based  correlation 
coefficients at baseline and Week 36 between the ClinRO Measure for Eyebrow Hair Loss and the PRO 
Measure for Eyebrows (primary), SALT (exploratory), Skindex-16 Emotions Domain (exploratory), and 
SF-36v2 Item 1 (exploratory). Correlations (that is, ≥0.5) were observed between the ClinRO Measure 
for  Eyebrow  Hair  Loss  and  the  PRO  Measure  for  Eyebrows  at  baseline  and  Week  36  in  both  Phase  3 
studies (Pearson correlation range 0.85-0.88). In the exploratory evaluations, moderate (that is, ≥0.3 
to <0.5) to large (that is, ≥0.5) correlations between the ClinRO Measure for Eyebrow Hair Loss and the 
SALT were observed at all time points in both studies. A correlation was observed between the ClinRO 
Measure for Eyelash Hair Loss and the PRO Measure for Eyelashes at baseline and Week 36 in both Phase 
3 studies (Pearson correlation range 0.86-0.88). In the exploratory evaluations, moderate (that is, ≥0.3 
to <0.5) to large (that is, ≥0.5) correlations between the ClinRO Measure for Eyelash Hair Loss and the 
SALT were observed at all time points in both studies. 
Additional secondary efficacy endpoints 
- 
Skindex-16™ Adapted for Alopecia Areata 
The Skindex-16 measures health-related quality of life in patients with skin diseases. The items’ wordings 
have been adapted and validated for use among adults with scalp AA. 
The Skindex-16 is composed of 16 items grouped under 3 domains: Symptoms (4 items), Emotions (7 
items) and Functioning (5 items). Patients answer each question with a number ranging from 0 (never 
bothered) to 6 (always bothered). Scores are transformed to a linear scale ranging from 0 (no effect) to 
100 (effect experienced all of the time), with higher scores indicating greater impact on quality of life. 
(Reid et al. 2012). 
-  Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 
The HADS is a widely used 14-item self-assessment scale that determines the levels of Anxiety (7 items) 
and Depression (7 items) that a patient experienced over the past week. The HADS utilises a 4-point 
Likert response scale (i.e. 0-3) for each item and is intended for ages 12 years to 65 years (Zigmond 
and Snaith 1983; White et al. 1999). Scores for each domain (i.e. Anxiety and Depression) can range 
from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating greater anxiety or depression (Zigmond and Snaith 1983; 
Snaith 2003). A HADS Anxiety Score or HADS Depression Score of ≥8 indicates that a patient is suffering 
from anxiety or depression, respectively (Bjelland et al. 2002).

Patient-Reported Outcome Measure for Eyebrow 
The MAH has developed a novel PRO assessment measuring the extent of EB Hair Loss: PRO Measure 
for EB Hair Loss. This PRO assessment is a single item that uses a 4-point response scale, ranging from 
0 (full coverage and no areas of hair loss) to 3 (no notable EB hair) (Wyrwich et al. 2020b).

- 
Patient-Reported Outcome Measure for Eyelash 
The MAH has developed a novel PRO assessment measuring the extent of EL Hair Loss: PRO Measure 
for EL Hair Loss. This PRO assessment is a single item that uses a 4-point response scale, ranging from 
0  (ELs  form  a  continuous  line  along  the  eyelids  on  both  eyes)  to  3  (no  notable  ELs)  (Wyrwich  et  al. 
2020b). 
Table 7 Final versions of PRO measures for eyebrows and eyelashes  
Sample size 
Phase 3 Portion of Study JAHO 
It was calculated that approximately up to 625 patients needed to be eligible for the primary efficacy 
analysis. That sample size will provide more than 90% power to detect a difference between the highest 
baricitinib dose selected and placebo treatment groups in the primary endpoint based on a Chi-square 
test, without continuity correction, at a significance level of 0.05, and assuming a difference of response 
of 25% (Kennedy Crispin  et al. 2016;  Mackay-Wiggan et al. 2016) with a 5% placebo response rate. 
Sample size was computed through using EAST v.6.4. P. 
Study JAIR 
Because 2 doses of baricitinib were identified to continue into Phase 3 after the interim analysis in Study 
JAHO,  approximately  678  patients  should  have  been  screened  in  order  to  enroll  approximately  476 
patients in Study JAIR. The enrolled patients were planned to be randomized in a 2:2:3 ratio for placebo 
Assessment report  
EMA/572597/2022  
Page 30/138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
QD (136 subjects), baricitinib low dose QD (136 subjects), or baricitinib high dose QD (204 subjects). 
This sample size provides more than 90% power to test the superiority of the selected baricitinib high 
dose to placebo or the superiority of the selected baricitinib low dose to placebo in the primary endpoint 
based on a 2-sided Fisher exact test within the graphical testing scheme, at an initial significance level 
of 0.04 for the high dose and 0.01 for the low dose.  
The  assumptions  used  for  the  power  calculation  are  as  follows:  30%  response  rate  for  the  selected 
baricitinib high dose, 20% response rate for the selected baricitinib low dose, and 5% response rate for 
placebo (Kennedy Crispin et al. 2016; Mackay-Wiggan et al. 2016). The initial alpha allocation may be 
adjusted in the SAP when newer information was obtained on the endpoints that were tested and were 
finalized prior to the primary database lock.  
Randomisation 
In both the Phase 3 Portion of Study JAHO and Study JAIR assignment to treatment groups was 
determined by a computer-generated random sequence using an interactive web-based response 
system (IWRS). The IWRS was used to assign bottles, each containing double-blind IP tablets, to each 
patient at each visit starting at Visit 2 (Week 0). Site personnel confirmed that they had located the 
correct bottles by entering a confirmation number found on the bottle into the IWRS. Both studies 
randomised patients 2:2:3 at baseline to placebo, baricitinib 2-mg or baricitinib 4-mg. Randomisation 
in both studies was stratified by geographic region (North America, Asia and Rest of World) and 
duration of current episode at baseline (<4 years versus ≥4 years). 
Blinding 
Both JAHO and JAIR are double-blind studies. To preserve the blinding of the study, a minimum 
number of persons was able to see the randomization table and treatment assignments before study 
completion. All study assessments were performed by study personnel who were blinded to the 
patients’ treatment groups. The 4-mg and 2-mg tablets have a distinctive shape and color. A double-
dummy design was used for blinding, where each strength tablet had its matching placebo. Study 
drugs were delivered to patients in bottles. 
JAHO was a seamless phase II/III trial with a decision point and interim analysis for futility and dose 
selection performed after 12-week follow-up was completed for the first 100 participants randomized. 
A second interim analyses of the phase II data were planned when these participants were followed-up 
for 36 weeks. A selected group of individuals was unblinded to work on this interim analysis. At the 
time of the first interim analysis, approximately 200 participants were already included in the phase III 
part of the trial.  Assignment of all participants in the phase III part of the trial remained blinded. 
In both the phase III part of JAHO and the JAIR study unblinding was performed after database lock 
for the primary efficacy analysis. 
Statistical methods 
Populations and treatment groups 
Unless otherwise specified, efficacy analyses in the Phase 3 studies JAHO and JAIR were conducted on 
the Full Analysis Set (FAS) population, which included all patients who were randomized. Sensitivity 
analyses were performed in the modified Full Analysis Set (mFAS) and the per protocol set (PPS). 
Assessment report  
EMA/572597/2022

Analyses performed 
The primary analysis of discrete efficacy and health outcomes variables was a logistic regression 
analysis with fixed effect for treatment group and adjustment for the baseline value and stratification 
factors geographic region and duration of current episode at Baseline (<4 years vs ≥4 years). The p-
value and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the odds ratio from the logistic regression model were used 
for primary statistical inference. In the case when logistic regression model did not produce statistical 
results due to sparse data, Fisher exact test was used. The difference in percentages and 95% CI of 
the difference in percentages using the Newcombe-Wilson method without continuity correction were 
used for descriptive purposes unless, otherwise, specified. 
The primary analysis for the continuous efficacy and health outcome variables was an ANCOVA with 
treatment group as the main predictor and adjustment for the baseline value and stratification factors 
geographic region and duration of the current episode at Baseline (<4 years vs ≥4 years). Type III 
tests for LS means will be used for statistical comparison between treatment groups. The LS mean 
difference, standard error, p-value, and 95% CI are also be reported. 
Time-to-event analysis were be done and analyzed using log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier curves. 
Handling of dropouts and missing data 
Missing discrete efficacy and health outcomes variables were imputed using NRI for logistic regression 
analyses. Patients were considered non-responders for the NRI-based analysis if they did not meet 
clinical response criteria or if they permanently discontinued study treatment or discontinued from the 
study at any time prior to the time point of interest for any reason.  
The modified last observation carried forward (mLOCF) was used for imputation of missing continuous 
efficacy and health outcome variables for ANCOVA analyses. The LOCF method uses the most recent 
non-missing postbaseline assessment. The use of LOCF was considered reasonable as very few 
patients experienced waxing and waning in scalp hair coverage during treatment in the Phase 2 portion 
of the JAHO study. The specific modification to the LOCF is that data after permanent study treatment 
discontinuation will not be carried forward. 
Assessment report  
EMA/572597/2022  
Page 32/138 
 
 
 
 
 
The primary censoring rule excluded data collected after permanent study drug discontinuation or data 
collected at remote visits due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The associated estimand for the primary 
objective is to measure the effect of baricitinib 4-mg or baricitinib 2-mg vs placebo on patients with 
severe or very severe AA as assessed by the proportion of patients achieving SALT ≤20 at Week 36, 
assuming that treatment response disappears at the visits conducted remotely because of the COVID-
19 pandemic or after patients discontinue from study or treatment.  
Sensitivity analyses 
Analyses for primary and key secondary health outcomes were repeated in the modified full analysis 
set (mFAS). Analyses for the primary outcome were repeated in the per protocol set (PPS). 
To determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the efficacy assessment of primary and key 
secondary endpoints, two types of supplemental analyses were performed.  
First, a secondary censoring rule was considered where data collected remotely was included in the 
analysis. Analyses for the secondary censoring used NRI or mLOCF for imputation of missing 
outcomes. 
Second, a hybrid imputation was implemented to handle the missing data due to the COVID-19 by 
multiple imputation or other missing data not due to COVID-19 by nonresponder imputation. The 
hybrid imputation handled missing data due to the COVID-19 pandemic by multiple imputation and 
other missing data not due to COVID-19 by nonresponder imputation or mLOCF. This imputation 
procedure addresses the hybrid estimand assuming that the effects of treatments will be the same had 
patients not experienced any intercurrent event related to COVID-19 (e.g., either remote visits or 
missed visits due to COVID-19, etc.) or the effect will disappear after any intercurrent event not 
related to COVID-19. The hybrid imputation was combined with the primary censoring rule.   
In addition, the following sensitivity analyses were prespecified in protocols and/or statistical analyses 
plans. Regarding the non-responder imputation (NRI), additional analyses were to be performed on all 
available data, hence including data collected after permanent treatment discontinuation. The placebo 
multiple imputation (pMI) method was planned as an additional analysis for the analysis of the primary 
efficacy endpoint, as well as key secondary endpoints. In the SAP, the pMI was replaced by the hybrid 
imputation method. Finally, the tipping point analysis was planned as an additional sensitivity analysis 
for some key secondary objectives and prespecified in both protocols and statistical analysis plans. 
Multiplicity adjustment 
Multiplicity adjusted analyses were be performed on the primary and key secondary objectives in order 
to control the overall family-wise Type I error rate within each study at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05.  
The graphical multiple testing procedure described in Bretz et al. (2011) was used. The graphs used 
for the final analyses are given in the final versions of the Statistical Analysis Plan (version 4 for JAHO 
and version 3 for JAIR). A different graph was used in JAHO and JAIR studies. In both JAHO and JAIR, 
the primary endpoint SALT ≤20 at week 36 was first tested at a 2-sided α=0.025 for both 2-mg and 4-
mg doses.  If at least 1 of null hypotheses is rejected, the testing process continues with testing of 
secondary endpoints at week 36 followed by testing of secondary endpoints at week 24, 12 and 16. 
The testing process continues as long as there is at least 1 hypothesis in the scheme that can be 
rejected at its allocated alpha level at that point. 
No adjustment was made for endpoints outside of the graphical testing procedure (these were all 
tested independently using an alpha of 0.05).  
The following graph was used in the JAHO study:

Study I4V-MC-JAIR [JAIR] 
A total of 727 patients were screened; 546 of these patients were randomized to a treatment group. 
Study discontinuation rates ranged from 13.5% in the placebo group 10.9% in the baricitinib 2-mg 
group, and 7.7 % in the baricitinib 4-mg group. Overall, 490 patients completed the Week 36 
treatment visit and entered the JAIR long-term extension period (Figure 11). 
Figure 11 
Study intervention disposition figure. Study JAIR. 
Across the 2 studies, 91% of patients completed Week 36. The most common reasons for study 
discontinuation were withdrawal by patient, lost to follow-up and adverse event. 
Recruitment 
JAHO study initiated on 24 September 2018 (first patient first visit). JAIR study initiated at 08 July 
2019 (first patient first visit). For both studies, the primary completion date (the analyses presented in

The MAH discusses the following reasons to justify registration in EU countries: 
- 
Baricitinib is already registered in the EU for the treatment of RA and AD. The pharmacokinetic 
(PK)  and  pharmacodynamic  (PD)  analyses  made  to  support  these  registrations  demonstrated 
that baricitinib is not sensitive to intrinsic ethnic factors. This is consistent with the results of the 
analyses made to support the AA indication. 
- 
- 
Clinical practice for the treatment of severe AA does not differ significantly around the world. 
52% of the patients studied in the AA clinical programme were Caucasian, versus 36% that were 
Asian and 8% that were Black. 
-  No data suggest regional differences in AA pathophysiology. 
Protocol deviations 
JAHO/Phase 3 portion 
There were 111 patients, 16.9% of the total, identified to have at least 1 important protocol deviation. 
The  most  frequent  important  protocol  deviations,  totalling  44  patients  (6.7%),  were  related  to 
discrepancies between the duration of current episode entered into the IWRS at Visit 2 for stratification 
(<4 years versus ≥4 years) and the confirmed date of onset of current episode entered later into the 
electronic  CRF.  28  protocol  deviations  were  due  to  informed  consent  issues.  16  cases  were  due  to 
violation  of  inclusion/exclusion  criteria:  inadequate  washout  of  prior  AA  treatment  (5  patients:  2  on 
placebo),  episode  less  than  6  months  (4  patients),  inadvertent  enrolment  (5  patient),  latent  TB  (1 
patient) and lab abnormalities (1 patient).    
Nine  patients  had  significant  noncompliance  with  study  treatment  (<80%  compliance)  during  the  36-
week double-blind treatment period:5 patients on placebo. 2 patients on baricitinib 2-mg.2 patients on 
baricitinib 4-mg. 
JAIR 
It was determined that 89 patients (16.3% of the randomized population) had at least one important 
protocol  deviation.  The  most  frequent  important  protocol  deviations,  totalling  38  patients  (7%),  were 
related  to  discrepancies  between  the  duration  of  current  episode  entered  into  IWRS  at  Visit  2  for 
stratification (<4 years versus ≥4 years) and the date of onset of current episode entered later into the 
eCRF. A similar rate of discrepancies was observed in the other Phase 3 trial (JAHO). 18 cases were due 
to  violation  of  inclusion/exclusion  criteria:  inadvertent  enrolment  (6  patient),  inadequate  washout  of 
prior AA treatment (3 patients: all on baricitinib), lab abnormalities (3 patients), IWRS data entry error 
impacting stratification (2 patient), enrolled with active or chronic HBV infection (1 patient), spontaneous

period (1 patient), enrolled with hair loss less than 50% of scalp (1 patient). 
Twenty-seven  (27)  patients  were  reported  with  significant  noncompliance  (4.9%  of  the  randomized 
population). Eleven patients were in placebo group. Nine patients had documentation of noncompliance

(<80%  compliance  to  the  study  treatment  use).  For  the  remaining  18  patients,  counting  of  returned 
study  treatment  was  not  available  for  the  complete  Period  2  due  to  some  visits  being  missing  or 
performed remotely, therefore these patients were assessed as noncompliant.  
Baseline data 
Patient Demographics 
The mean age was 37.5 years across the studies. A low proportion of patients aged 65 years or older 
were enrolled in the studies due to the upper age limit specified in the inclusion criteria (i.e. 60 years for 
males and 70 years for females). A slightly higher proportion of females enrolled in the studies compared 
to males (61% versus 39%, respectively). A higher proportion of patients were enrolled in North America 
and Asia in Study JAHO compared to Study JAIR, and only 3 countries participated in Study JAHO.

Baseline Disease Characteristics 
Over  half  of  all  patients  enrolled  in  the  studies  had  very  severe  AA  at  baseline  (SALT  95-100).  The 
median SALT score across the studies was 96. The mean duration from the first onset of AA diagnosis 
was 12.1 years in Study JAHO and 12.2 years in Study JAIR. The mean duration of the current AA episode 
was 3.9 years and was higher in Study JAIR than Study JAHO. Across the 2 AA studies, the mean duration 
of  current  AA  episode  was  slightly  higher  in  the  placebo  and  baricitinib  2-mg  groups  compared  to 
baricitinib  4-mg.  However,  the  proportion  of  patients  with  a  current  episode  duration  ≥4  years  was 
slightly higher in the 4-mg groups compared to the other treatment groups.  
Approximately 38% of patients reported an atopic background, defined as a medical history of or ongoing 
atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis or allergic asthma. Investigators determined that 
approximately 44% of patients had AA universalis. Investigators determined that approximately 9% of 
patients  had  AA  ophiasis,  which  presents  as  a  band-like  pattern  of  hair  loss  along  the  border  of  the 
temporal and occipital bones (Pratt et al. 2017). 
Across the AA studies, 69% of patients had significant or complete EB Hair Loss at baseline, and 58% 
had significant or complete EL Hair Loss at baseline, as measured by ClinRO Measures for EB and EL Hair 
Loss scores of 2 or 3.

Prior Alopecia Areata Therapy 
Approximately 90% of patients in the AA studies reported prior AA therapy (Table 11). Over 26% of 
patients had used topical immunotherapy. Over 50% had used systemic immunosuppressant or 
immunomodulator therapy, the most common of which was corticosteroids (39%). Around 19% had 
used ciclosporin, and approximately 11% had used methotrexate. Approximately 5% of patients had 
used a JAK inhibitor. Patients with prior inadequate response to JAK inhibitors were excluded from the 
trials.

A washout of systemic and topical treatments for AA was incorporated before randomisation to 
minimise confounding effects of prior treatment. Durations of required washouts took into 
consideration that a delay of several weeks may be observed between treatments and regrowth of hair 
in patients with AA.

Patient compliance 
Patient compliance with study medication was assessed at each scheduled visit during the treatment 
period (Visit 3 through Visit 18) by counting returned tablets. Descriptive statistics for percent 
compliance and non-compliance rate were summarized using the FAS population for Phase 3 portion by 
treatment group for Week 0 through 36, with data up to permanent treatment discontinuation.  
The mean compliance (Table 13) is the average of individual compliance percentage (0 to 100) among 
the FAS population based on the calculation of the number of tablets taken by the patient versus the 
expected number of tablets.  
At each visit, patients were dispensed bottles containing 36 tablets for each dosage of baricitinib 
(baricitinib 2 mg or matching placebo and baricitinib 4 mg or matching placebo). Patients received 1 
bottle of each dosage when visit intervals was 4 weeks, 2 bottles when visit interval was 8 weeks and 
3 bottles when visit interval was 12 weeks.   
The number of tablets taken by the patient is based on the total number of tablets dispensed and 
returned during the specific time period. If patients were unable to return to sites (remote visit) or did 
not bring back used bottles to the investigative site, the returned number of tablets was imputed as 0, 
which could result in some patients appearing as over compliant (>100% compliance; Table 13).  
The number of expected doses, tablets dispensed, tablets returned, and percentage compliance is 
listed by patient for Week 0 to 36, with data up to permanent treatment discontinuation.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint  
In Studies JAHO and JAIR, both baricitinib 4-mg and 2-mg met the primary endpoint, demonstrating 
statistically significant improvements compared to placebo in SALT ≤20 at Week 36. 
The proportion of patients demonstrating SALT ≤20 at Week 36 in the treatment groups were 
comparable across the 2 trials. 
At both the individual-study level and the pooled-database level, the response rate of baricitinib 4-mg 
for SALT ≤20 at Week 36 was approximately 14 percentage points higher than that of baricitinib 2-mg 
(Table 14). In post-hoc analysis, the difference between baricitinib 4-mg and 2-mg was statistically 
significant.

The MAH has conducted sensitivity analyses to evaluate the impact of protocol deviations and 
differences among analysis populations. Data collected remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic were 
included in secondary censoring rule analyses. Missing data due to the COVID-19 pandemic were 
imputed using hybrid imputation for the primary and key secondary endpoint analyses.

Results of Sensitivity Analyses (JAIR) 
Key Secondary Endpoints 
Severity of Alopecia Tool ≤20 at Week 24 and Week 16 
Baricitinib 4-mg demonstrated a statistically significant improvement compared to placebo in SALT ≤20 
as early as Week 16 in Study JAHO and as early as Week 24 in Study JAIR, after adjustment for 
multiplicity (Figure 19). Baricitinib 2-mg demonstrated a statistically significant improvement 
compared to placebo in SALT ≤20 at Week 24 and Week 36 in Study JAHO, and only at Week 36 in 
Study JAIR, after adjustment for multiplicity. 
For earlier timepoints not in the graphical testing procedure, baricitinib 4-mg demonstrated a 
statistically significant improvement compared to placebo in SALT ≤20 as early as Week 8 in Study 
JAHO and Week 12 in Study JAIR. Baricitinib 2-mg demonstrated a statistically significant improvement 
compared to placebo in SALT ≤20 starting at Week 24 in Study JAHO and Week 16 in Study JAIR.

For  SALT  percent  change  from  baseline,  both  baricitinib  4-mg  and  2-mg  demonstrated  a  statistically 
significant improvement compared to placebo at Week 36 in Study JAHO within the framework of the 
graphical testing procedure. In Study JAIR, for SALT percent change from baseline only baricitinib 4-mg 
demonstrated a statistically significant improvement compared to placebo. 
Severity of Alopecia Tool 90 and Severity of Alopecia Tool ≤10 
SALT90 and SALT ≤10 are more stringent endpoints, representing almost complete coverage of the scalp 
by hair. 
For  SALT90  and  SALT  ≤10  at  Week  36,  both  baricitinib  4-mg  and  2-mg  demonstrated  a  statistically 
significant  improvement  compared  to  placebo  in  Study  JAHO  within  the  framework  of  the  graphical 
testing  procedure.  In  Study  JAIR,  only  baricitinib  4-mg  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant 
improvement compared to placebo at the same Week-36 endpoints within the framework of the graphical 
testing procedure. 
For  SALT  ≤10  at  Week  24,  both  baricitinib  4-mg  and  2-mg  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant 
improvement  compared  with  placebo  in  Study  JAHO  within  the  framework  of  the  graphical  testing 
procedure.  In  Study  JAIR,  for  SALT  ≤10  at  Week  24  both  doses  failed  to  demonstrate  statistically 
significant improvement within the framework of the graphical testing. 
Severity of Alopecia Tool 50 
Baricitinib  4-mg  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  improvement  compared  with  placebo  in  the 
proportion  of  patients  achieving  SALT50  at  Week  12  within  the  framework  of  the  graphical  testing 
procedure  in  Study  JAHO  but  not  in  Study  JAIR.  Baricitinib  2-mg  failed  to  demonstrate  statistically 
significant improvement over placebo in the proportion of patients achieving SALT50 at Week 12 in both 
trials within the framework of the graphical testing procedure.

Additional Efficacy Endpoints 
AA produces visible disfiguring patches of hair loss that are randomly distributed and of various sizes, 
or total hair loss, both of which can lead to a profound distortion of appearance (Pratt et al. 2017). 
Hair loss in visible areas, such as the scalp, eyebrows, and eyelashes, is considered by patients with 
AA to be the most bothersome aspect of the condition and the primary cause of their distress (FDA 
2017; Davey et al. 2019; Aldhouse et al. 2020). 
The SALT is widely used in clinical trials to assess the extent of scalp-hair loss in AA and has been 
considered sufficient to measure disease extent in clinical practice in a recent international consensus 
(Meah et al. 2020). 
There has been very limited clinical research activity in AA over the past decades, and there is an 
overall lack of guidance on treatment goals in AA. Therefore, prior to initiating this clinical programme, 
the MAH conducted physician and patient interviews to define a clinically relevant definition of 
treatment success in patients with severe scalp AA (≥ 50% scalp hair loss, that is, a SALT score ≥50). 
This led to the proposal of an Alopecia Areata Investigator Global Assessment score of 0 or 1 
(corresponding to a SALT score ≤20) as a definition of treatment success for patients with severe scalp 
AA (Wyrwich et al. 2020).   
Multiple studies have shown that AA may have a significant negative impact on health related quality 
of life and result in higher levels of anxiety and a greater risk of depression (Liu et al. 2016, Okhovat 
et al. 2019). Quality of life impairment and psychological burden are important considerations for the 
therapeutic management of patients with AA (Messenger et al. 2012, Rossi et al. 2019). 
Skindex-16 Adapted for Alopecia Areata 
Assessment report  
EMA/572597/2022  
Page 49/138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Skindex-16 was identified as a potential measure for adaptation, as it captures the most relevant 
and clinically important aspects of health status for patients with chronic dermatologic conditions. The 
Skindex-16 was originally developed for dermatology conditions and includes the question stem ‘your 
skin condition’. Therefore, the Skindex-16 AA was adapted by the MAH for use with adults with AA 
primarily through changing ‘your skin condition’ with ‘your alopecia’ or ‘your scalp’. A sample version of 
the adapted instrument for cognitive testing was approved for use by the original author and license 
holders.  
Qualitative research to determine the relevance of AA patients’ understanding and interpretation of the 
Skindex-16 AA was conducted in The MAH sponsored research through 2 rounds of interviews with a 
total of 37 patients. Skindex-16 adapted for AA items were relevant to patients and their experience 
with AA. Overall, the Skindex-16 AA was well understood and considered by patients to assess relevant 
concepts associated with AA. The updated adapted version of the Skindex-16 AA was used in Studies 
JAIR and JAHO. 
The Skindex-16 AA is composed of 16 items grouped under 3 domains: Symptoms (4 items), Emotions 
(7 items), and Functioning (5 items). Each item is scored on a 7-point Likert-type scale and 
transformed to a linear scale ranging from 0 (never bothered) to 100 (always bothered) for analysis. 
No minimal clinically important change has been defined for Skindex domain scores, but 
responsiveness to change in skin status was demonstrated in other dermatological conditions (Chren et 
al. 2001). 
In Studies JAHO and JAIR, baricitinib 4-mg demonstrated a statistically significant improvement 
compared to placebo for mean change from baseline in Skindex-16 Emotions and Functioning domains 
at Week 36. Baricitinib 4-mg also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement compared to 
placebo for mean change from baseline in the Skindex-16 Symptoms domain at Week 36 in Study 
JAIR. 
In Studies JAHO and JAIR, baricitinib 2-mg demonstrated a statistically significant improvement 
compared to placebo for mean change from baseline in the Skindex-16 Emotions domain at Week 36. 
Baricitinib 2-mg also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement compared to placebo in 
mean change from baseline in the Symptoms domain at Week 36 in Study JAHO.

The placebo and treatment groups from both studies were pooled to assess improvement in the 
skindex domains at Week 36 according to the responder status (achieving SALT ≤20 versus not 
achieving SALT ≤20). Skindex domains were further analysed and stratified by baseline 
characteristics: 
• 
• 
• 
gender (male, female) 
duration of current episode (<4 years versus ≥4 years), and 
SALT score (severe [SALT 50-94], very severe [SALT 95-100]). 
At Week 36, patients achieving SALT ≤20 showed greater improvements in all skindex-16 domains 
than patients with SALT >20. For the duration of current episode ≥4 years and SALT 95-100 score at 
baseline subgroups the Skindex-16 Symptoms Domain worsened for those with SALT >20. All other 
subgroups showed improvement in all 3 domains and the patients with SALT ≤20 within each subgroup 
showed greater improvement than those with SALT >20 (Figure 12, Figure 13, Figure 14).

Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 
The HADS has been adapted for use across multiple diseases to assess psychological symptoms, 
including many dermatological conditions (Hansson et al. 2009). Although HADS has not been 
specifically validated in AA, research suggests that patients with AA are potentially at a higher risk of 
anxiety and depression (Okhovat et al. 2019). 
HADS is a 14-item self-assessment scale that determines the levels of anxiety (7 items) and 
depression (7 items) that a patient is experiencing over the past week. HADS utilises a 4-point Likert 
response scale (e.g., 0 to 3) for each item, and is intended for ages 12 to 65 years. Scores for each 
domain (anxiety and depression) can range from 0 to 21 where higher scores indicate greater anxiety 
or depression. A HADS-Anxiety or HADS-Depression score of ≥8 is indicative of notable anxiety or 
depression (Hansson et al. 2009).

In Studies JAHO and JAIR, baricitinib 4-mg demonstrated a statistically significant improvement 
compared to placebo for mean change from baseline in the HADS Anxiety total score at Week 36. 
Baricitinib 4-mg also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement compared to placebo for 
mean change from baseline in the HADS Depression total score at Week 36 in Study JAIR.

The placebo and treatment groups from both studies were pooled to assess improvement in symptoms 
of anxiety and depression at Week 36 according to the responder status (achieving SALT ≤20 versus 
not achieving SALT ≤20).  
These analyses were performed for each subpopulation of patients with baseline HADS-Anxiety ≥8 or 
HADS-Depression ≥8 and stratified by baseline characteristics: 
• 
• 
• 
gender (male, female) 
duration of current episode (<4 years versus ≥4 years), and 
SALT score (severe [SALT 50-94], very severe [SALT 95-100]). 
At Week 36, patients achieving SALT ≤20 showed greater improvements in HADS-Anxiety or HADS-
Depression than those with SALT >20. All subgroups showed improvement in both domains. Within 
each subgroup, the patients with SALT ≤20 showed greater improvement than those with SALT >20 
(Figure 15, Figure 16).

Ancillary analyses 
MAH performed subgroup analyses on the Pooled Week 36 Efficacy Population to investigate the effects 
of various demographic and baseline characteristics on the key, the predefined endpoint of SALT ≤20 
at Week 36. These subgroups were based upon gender, age, weight, eGFR, race, geographic region, 
baseline diseases severity (SALT category) and current AA episode duration category. 
As seen with the overall population, a higher proportion of patients in the baricitinib 4-mg group 
demonstrated SALT ≤20 at Week 36 compared to baricitinib 2-mg in each of the subgroups.

Efficacy Results for Disease Severity and Duration Subpopulations 
To determine the effect of baseline AA disease severity and episode duration on the efficacy of 
baricitinib, MAH compared efficacy results for the following subpopulations of patients: 
• 
• 
patients with severe AA (SALT 50-94) versus very severe (SALT 95-100) and 
patients with current duration of AA episode <4 years versus ≥4 years. 
These analyses were conducted using the Pooled Week 36 Efficacy Population as well as the FAS for 
each individual study. 
Analysis of the Pooled Week 36 Efficacy Population demonstrated a statistically significant 
improvement compared to placebo for both baricitinib 4-mg and 2-mg in SALT ≤20 at Week 36 across 
both AA disease severity and episode duration subpopulations. At both the pooled-database level and 
Assessment report

the individual-study level, baricitinib 4-mg consistently achieved a higher response rate than baricitinib 
2-mg, regardless of baseline disease severity or episode duration. 
For both doses of baricitinib, patients with severe AA or duration <4 years achieved a higher response 
rate for SALT ≤20 at Week 36 compared to those with very severe AA or duration ≥4 years, 
respectively.

Regarding key secondary endpoints Baricitinib 4-mg achieved a statistically significant improvement 
compared to placebo for each of these endpoints across both AA disease severity and episode duration 
subpopulations. The results for baricitinib 2-mg were less consistent. Baricitinib 2-mg achieved a 
statistically significant improvement compared to placebo for:

Baricitinib 4-mg demonstrated a statistically significant improvement compared to placebo in SALT ≤20 
as early as Week 16 in Study JAHO and as early as Week 24 in Study JAIR, after adjustment for 
multiplicity (Figure 19). Baricitinib 2-mg demonstrated a statistically significant improvement 
compared to placebo in SALT ≤20 at Week 24 and Week 36 in Study JAHO, and only at Week 36 in 
Study JAIR, after adjustment for multiplicity. 
For earlier timepoints not in the graphical testing procedure, baricitinib 4-mg demonstrated a 
statistically significant improvement compared to placebo in SALT ≤20 as early as Week 8 in Study 
JAHO and Week 12 in Study JAIR. Baricitinib 2-mg demonstrated a statistically significant improvement

Time Needed to Observe Hair Re
growth: Stopping Rule in the Absence of Response 
In AA, the hair follicles are preserved and, therefore, the potential for recovery of hair growth is in 
‑
theory maintained over life. However, due to the scarcity of clinical research in AA, very little is known 
about the time to response for the treatments currently used.  
Patients enrolled in the AA clinical programme had severe AA for at least 6 months. However, hair 
growth being driven by the cyclic functioning of the hair follicles, the amount of hair of a patient may 
slightly vary over time. Therefore, “no significant response” was defined as the failure to reach a 
reduction of at least 30% from baseline of the total SALT score (SALT30) during the 52 week treatment 
period. SALT30 was the clinical response endpoint used for dose selection after 12 weeks of treatment 
in the Phase 2 portion of the Study JAHO that informed the choice of dose for Phase 3 (King et al. 
2021). SALT30 was also selected as the threshold for efficacy assessment in other Phase 2 studies: 
• 
• 
one evaluating ritlecitinib and brepocitinib in patients with severe AA (SALT score ≥50) (Peeva 
et al. 2021), and 
one evaluating dupilumab in patients with ≥30% scalp hair loss (Guttman-Yassky et al. 2021). 
Assessment report  
EMA/572597/2022  
Page 60/138 
 
 
 
 
 
With this rationale, the MAH analysed the patients randomly assigned to baricitinib 4 mg at Week 0 
and divided them into 2 categories: 
•  SALT30 Non-responders (n = 160, 31%) who never achieved SALT30 over the 52 week period. 
Although SALT scores may have fluctuated over the 52 weeks, overall there was no trend 
towards improvement.  
•  SALT30 Responders (n = 355, 69%) achieved SALT30 at any time over the 52 week period. 
The unsupervised machine learning method growth mixture model (GMM; Jung and Wickrama 2008; 
Proust-Lima et al. 2017) is a novel method of latent class mixed model, to identify distinct clusters 
based on the similarity in the individual patient trajectories overtime. Further, within the category of 
SALT30 Responders, trajectory analysis using GMM allowed grouping of patients into 3 subcategories 
according to 3 different patterns of response (Figure 20): 
•  Early responders (n = 102, 20%) for whom improvement was observed soon after treatment 
initiation (4 to 12 weeks) 
•  Gradual responders (n = 143, 28%) for whom the threshold of 30% improvement was reached 
between 12 to 36 weeks, and 
• 
Late responders (n = 110, 21%) had longer response time and may have included periods of 
relapse after early improvement. Overall, hair re
growth occurred at later time points such that 
the proportion of patients reaching SALT30 continued to increase until Week 52

Patterns of response. 
Predictor analysis  
Within the SALT30 Responders group, about two-third (early
 and gradual
 responder groups) will 
achieve SALT30 within the first 9 months (36 weeks) of the treatment. The objective of the post-hoc 
‑
‑
predictor analysis is, therefore, to provide guidance on discontinuing treatment before Week 52 for the 
non-responder group.  
To evaluate a potential stopping rule for the non-responder group, 2 parameters were tested to predict 
the lack of response up to Week 52 (final time point tested in these datasets) ; (1) magnitude of SALT 
improvement (20% and 25% improvement from baseline), and time points (namely Weeks 24 and 
36).  Predictors were evaluated by how well these could identify potential non
responders.  
The corresponding prediction accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV) is shown in Table 25. 
‑
Assessment report  
EMA/572597/2022  
Page 61/138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
PPV is the probability that the patients who reach 20% or 25% improvement of SALT score at Week 24 
or Week 36, will become SALT30 Responders by Week 52.  
NPV is the probability that patients who did not achieve 20% or 25% improvement of SALT score at 
Week 24 or Week 36 will also be non
responders who would never achieve SALT30 by Week 52. The 
higher the NPV, the higher the likelihood of identifying true non-responders (who should therefore be 
discontinued) rather than mistakenly identifying a late responder, who would benefit from continuing 
‑
treatment. 
The NPVs at Week 36 were higher than those at Week 24, for both 20% and 25% improvement of 
SALT from baseline (Table 25). Therefore, Week 36 is a more appropriate time point to predict later 
non-response and make a treatment decision, such as discontinuation.  
The highest NPV (75.2%) and overall highest prediction accuracy (combination of highest sensitivity, 
specificity, PPV, and NPV) in predicting non-responders was associated with no response 20% 
improvement from baseline in SALT score (SALT20) at Week 36 (Table 25). 
Not achieving a response of 25% at Week 36 was associated with a lower NPV (71.6%), that is, SALT25 
improvement cut off might be too high a threshold at Week 36 for some late responders. More late 
responders would be discontinued based on this rule, despite the potential for response by Week 52.  
The NPVs from Week 24 are much lower compared with Week 36, indicating that it would not be 
recommended to establish a discontinuation rule as early as Week 24, as this would lead to patients 
being discontinued from treatment early, despite the potential for response by Week 52.

To support the above analysis and conclusion, the proportion of patients reaching SALT ≤20 (primary 
endpoint) over time among patients who met, and did not meet, the predictor criterion SALT20 at Week 
36 was assessed. As shown in Figure 21, the use of SALT20 at Week 36 for prediction confirms that few 
patients identified as non
responders will improve further with longer duration of treatment by Week 
52.

Based on this data, failure to reach SALT20 at Week 36 could be used as a criterion to identify patients 
who will not present a significant response and for whom treatment discontinuation could be 
considered. 
Maintenance of Efficacy after Randomised Down
Titration 
All patients randomly assigned at baseline (Week 0) to baricitinib 4 mg in Study JAIR and who reached 
‑
SALT =<20 at Week 52 were eligible for inclusion in the randomised down-titration period, irrespective 
of the timing of reaching SALT =<20. At Week 52, 86 patients were re
randomised in a 1:1 ratio to 
remain on 4 mg (44 patients) or to be down-titrated to 2 mg (42 patients). At the data cutoff date, the 
‑
analysis set included 83 patients (96.5%) who had completed Week 76, and 3 patients (3.5%) who 
had discontinued after Week 52 and prior to Week 76

At Week 76, an adequate clinical response (SALT ≤20) was achieved by 74% (31 of 42) of the patients 
who were down
titrated to baricitinib 2 mg, and by 96% (42 of 44) of the patients who remained on 
baricitinib 4 mg (Figure 22).

Among the 42 patients down-titrated to baricitinib 2 mg, 37 patients had reached SALT ≤20 before or 
at Week 36 and 30 (81.1%) of them had SALT ≤ 20 at Week 76. Five (5) patients had reached SALT 
≤20 for the first time between Week 40 and 52 and only 1 (20%) maintained SALT ≤ 20 at Week 76.

Maintenance of Efficacy after Randomised Withdrawal and Optimal Treatment Duration  
All patients randomly assigned at baseline (Week 0) to baricitinib 4 or 2 mg in Study JAHO and who 
had reached SALT ≤20 at Week 52 were eligible for inclusion in the randomised withdrawal period. At 
Week 52, 154 (115 on baricitinib 4 mg and 39 on baricitinib 2 mg) eligible patients were re
randomised 
in a 3:1 ratio to remain on their current dose of baricitinib or transition to placebo. The 3:1  
‑
randomisation was selected to limit the number of patients re
randomised to placebo, as it was 
anticipated that the majority of them would relapse (Zhou et al. 2021) that could have important 
‑
psychological impact (Aldhouse et al. 2020; Mostaghimi et al. 2021). Table 27 presents a summary of

52 week results submitted during the review process showed that efficacy

Supportive studies 
In 2018, the MAH had performed a patient preference study to understand whether patients with AA 
would be willing to accept the potential safety risks identified in phase 3 clinical trials of baricitinib in 
the RA program to achieve the expected level of efficacy of baricitinib in AA.  
Methods 
The study was designed as a web-based survey to estimate the risk tolerance of patients with at least 
50% scalp hair loss due to AA, for an immunosuppressant treatment of their disease by assessing 
preferences for a 1 in 3 chance of having hair on 80% to 100% of the scalp within 1 year relative to 
three risks: serious infection, venous thromboembolic event, and malignancy. Basically, patients were 
asked to choose a preference for one of two states: a reference profile (no treatment and no adverse 
drug reactions) and a target profile of an immunosuppressive agent. The favourable effect in the target 
profile (see above) was kept constant and the size of the risks were varied, depending on the 
preferences that the respondents indicated on the questions. Annual risks were based on the RA trials, 
and were varied between 1.5% - 6.0% for serious infection; 0.5% - 2% for cancer; 0.2% - 1.0% for 
VTE. Patient appropriate descriptions were developed and tested for the descriptions of attributes and 
levels. 
The inclusion/exclusion criteria were similar as the main criteria used in the pivotal trials. 
The statistical analysis included (1) a baseline choice model that identified the respondent 
characteristics that are associated with a higher likelihood of choosing the AA medicine, (2) a constant-
only interval-regression model that estimated the MAR for each risk, and (3) a covariate-adjusted 
interval-regression model that estimated the effect of various respondent characteristics on the MAR 
for each risk.

Results 
In total, 701 individuals responded by clicking the link in the e-mail invitation through the National 
Alopecia Areata Foundation (NAAF); the final sample consists of 178 respondents. 
Approximately 90% of the sample was female; the average age was approximately 40 years, with ages 
ranging from 18 to 70 years. Nearly 75% of the sample described themselves as white or Caucasian. 
The average time since AA diagnosis was 12 years.  
Approximately half (49%) of respondents stated that they would choose an AA medicine with a 
benefit-risk profile based on the expected benefit of the 4-mg dose of baricitinib in AA and the safety 
data from the 4-mg dose of baricitinib in the RA phase 3 program in the baseline question: 33% 
chance on 80%-100% scalp hair coverage in 1 year; 3% risk on serious infection each year; 1% risk 
on developing cancer each year; 0.5% of getting a blood clot each year. 
The averaged maximal acceptable risk (MAR) was similar to the value presented in the baseline 
question (3.3% for risk of serious infection, 1.2% for risk of cancer, and 0.7% for increased risk of 
getting a blood clot). However, the distributions of the individually elicited Maximum Acceptable Risks 
were bimodal for all three risks (Figure 28 below for serious infection). This indicates that about 
equally large proportions of respondents indicated to accept no risks with the treatment or risks more 
than the maximum risk specified (empirically based on the RA trials). 
Patients who were younger perceived more (physical, social, or emotional) impact of AA, missed hair in 
all parts of the body, were experienced with prescription medicine, were inclined to accept higher risks.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Overall, the design of JAHO and JAIR clinical trials is acceptable. It is stated that efficacy data of the 
phase 2 portion in the JAHO study is excluded from overall results, and considering the aim of the 
phase 2 part (dose-finding) this is agreed. In the ‘phase 3’ studies, adult patients with severe AA, 
defined as ≥50% scalp hair loss, and a current episode of more than six months, were randomized to 
placebo (N=345), baricitinib 2-mg QD (N=340) or 4-mg QD (N=515), for 36 weeks. Patients with 
other types of alopecia were excluded. This is in line with the intended indication of patients with at 
Assessment report  
EMA/572597/2022  
Page 72/138 
 
 
 
 
 
least severe AA. At the CHMP’s request, the MAH included in the wording of the indication a reference 
to the definition of severe AA included in the section 5.1 of the SmPC to ensure that it was clear for the 
prescriber. 
Concomitant therapy with topical or intra-articular corticosteroids (except on scalp, eyebrows and 
eyelashes) were allowed during pivotal trials. Only 4.3% of patients used concomitant AA therapies 
during the studies. These concomitant therapies were balanced among treatment groups.  
The primary outcome measure was based on the SALT score. The SALT score is often used in clinical 
practice and scientific research to measure the severity of AA disease. Considering SALT as the primary 
outcome for the pivotal trials is acceptable. SALT≤ 20 at week 36 was considered as the primary 
endpoint, corresponding to scalp hair loss of ≤20% or at least 80% scalp hair coverage. The clinical 
relevance of reaching a SALT≤20 for patients with severe AA was determined using panels from 
physicians and patients (Wyrwich et al., 2020). The treatment target of the clinician assessed primary 
outcome SALT<20 aligns with the treatment target of the patient-assessed scalp hair assessment of 0 
or 1, which also was found clinical relevant by panel of patients with severe AA taking part in the 
development (Wyrwich et al. 2020c). This supports the clinical relevance of the primary outcome, and 
it is considered that the primary endpoint is a clinically relevant outcome for the target population. 
However, both the clinician-assessed SALT score and the patient assessed Scalp Hair Assessment 
essentially measure the same measurement concept: the amount of hair (loss). It is acknowledged 
that the amount of hair drives satisfaction and relevance of treatment effects. Satisfaction with the 
results also depends on the site of remaining hair loss and was not directly assessed. However, it could 
be inferred through the results on Skindex-16 subscales and HADS subscales. The MAH has adequately 
discussed the clinical relevance of the results of Skindex and HADS including relevant subgroups: 
males/females, severe/very severe, disease duration.  
Follow-up of 36 weeks is considered acceptable as AA is a chronic, relapsing disease. Although it is 
reported that up to 50% of patients who present with patchy AA experience spontaneous hair regrowth 
within one year, most will relapse months or years after remission (Messenger AG et al., 2012). 
Therefore, the long-term efficacy results are important for the assessment. An update of the efficacy 
data, including completed 52-week results, has been provided during the procedure.  
No EMA scientific advice for AA has been sought. Based on US FDA recommendations, the MAH 
developed the Alopecia Areata Investigator’s Global Assessment (AA-IGA), the Scalp Hair Assessment 
PRO™, the ClinRO Measure for Eyebrows Hair Loss™, and the ClinRO Measure for Eyelash Hair Loss™. 
The MAH has developed the Scalp Hair Assessment PRO. This measure was intended to confirm the 
results of SALT score through patients themselves. The measurement properties were only evaluated 
internally within the two pivotal trials, and no external validation has been performed. In the absence 
of sensitivity to change, this is considered acceptable.  
It is known that AA can cause eyebrow and eyelash loss. ClinRO Measures for Eyebrow and Eyelash 
Hair Loss, showed a correlation with SALT and PRO scalp measures. However, they were not suitable 
to distinguish the quality of life differences (measured by the Skindex-16 Emotions Domain Score).  
PRO assessments for Eyebrows and Eyelashes are newly introduced measurement tools developed by 
the MAH. Data on the establishment of validity and reliability and the ability of PRO measures of 
eyebrows and eyelashes to detect change has been provided. It is considered that comparison of a 
novel instrument (here Clinician-Reported Outcomes for Eyebrow Hair Loss and Eyelash Hair Loss) with 
another novel and by MAH developed instrument (here Patient-Reported Outcome Measure for 
Eyebrows/Eyelashes) is scientifically not ideal and that no external validation was done. However, the 
results of reliability and validity tests through correlation with other instruments (SALT and Skindex-16 
Assessment report  
EMA/572597/2022  
Page 73/138 
 
 
 
 
Emotions Domain) are reassuring. Therefore, the selection of these measures as key secondary 
outcomes is acceptable.  
Skindex-16™ and HADS are established assessment scales and clinically relevant because AA affects 
the quality of life and has a psychological burden on patients. For Skindex-16, the MAH has adapted 
the wording for AA patients.  
Assumptions underlying the sample size calculation were based on studies in other JAK inhibitors, 
which is a reasonable approach. Given the assumptions made, the calculations are acceptable. As 
envisioned, the alpha allocation was adjusted before database lock, and testing has been done using 
the updated significance level of 0.025 for both the high and low dose. The adapted allocation of the 
significance level is accepted as it provides equal opportunity for the low and high dose to show 
efficacy. It must be noted that this adaptation has negatively impacted the power for the high dose 
and positively impacted the power for the low dose. This is not further pursued, as both studies 
reached significance on the primary endpoint for both doses. The procedures used for randomisation 
and stratification are adequate. The double-dummy design and measures taken to keep study 
participants and study personnel blinded appear to be appropriate. 
The use of the FAS population for primary efficacy analyses is considered acceptable. 
Analysis of dichotomous endpoints was performed using logistic regression with adjustment for 
baseline value and stratification factors which is considered the standard method of analysis and is 
acceptable. Analysis of continuous outcomes was performed using ANCOVA with adjustment for 
baseline value and stratification factors which is considered acceptable.  
Both the logistic regression and ANCOVA analyses require imputation of missing outcome data at week 
36 for analysis in the FAS. Non-responder imputation (NRI) was used as the primary method for 
imputation used for the dichotomous outcomes. The modified LOCF was used for imputation of 
continuous outcomes. Although both these methods for imputation are considered acceptable, 
sensitivity analyses are required to show the robustness of results to the imputation methods used.  
Regarding the multiplicity adjustments, there were some small differences between the graphs used 
for the hierarchical testing procedure in the two phase 3 trials. In both Studies JAIR and JAHO, graphs 
in Statistical Analysis Plan differed from the graphs in the original protocols. In addition, the original 
plan to use the alpha level of 0.04 for the 4-mg dose and 0.01 for the 2-mg dose, was changed to an 
alpha level of 0.025 for both doses. This change was already discussed when assessing the sample 
size. As these changes were made before the final database lock, they are considered acceptable.  
The assumptions made regarding missing outcomes after permanent discontinuation of study 
treatment were robust in sensitivity analyses.  
For the 2-mg dosing regimen, efficacy could not be declared for some of the secondary endpoints with 
a nominal p-value below 0.001 because a hypothesis higher in the hierarchy was not rejected. This 
leaves the efficacy of 2 mg with some uncertainty, and supports choice for 4 mg as the main dose.  
No studies were conducted in European countries. PK analysis from other indications has not shown 
differences between subjects with different ethnicities for baricitinib. Furthermore, efficacy in AA was 
comparable in the subgroup analysis of different regional groups. Therefore, it is not expected that 
efficacy will be different in European countries.  
Protocol deviations in both studies were mostly dues to misclassification of the current episode. 
Deviations which violated inclusion/exclusion criteria results are low in numbers and stratified between 
placebo and treatment arms. The possibility that these deviations have affected the efficacy results is 
low. Deviations due to non-compliance also occurred in the placebo group at a comparable and small 
rate. 
Assessment report  
EMA/572597/2022  
Page 74/138 
 
 
 
 
Overall, rate of discontinuations was comparable between treatment arms and placebo in both studies. 
The most frequent reasons for discontinuation were withdrawal by subject (3-6%), adverse events (1-
3%) and lost to follow up (1-3%). The rates for both reasons were negligible and comparable between 
all treatment arms. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The overall patients' characteristics were comparable between the different treatment groups. The 
largest difference between the trials was observed in geographical regions, as more patients from 
North America were included in JAHO study compared to JAIR study (around 55% versus around 35%, 
respectively). This is not supposed to have an impact on efficacy results; it is referred to the subgroup 
analysis section for more details. The disease baseline characteristics were comparable between 
placebo and treatment arms. Only the proportion of patients with very severe AA was slightly higher in 
the baricitinib 2-mg group (57%) compared to baricitinib 4-mg and placebo (52% in both). This 
difference is considered small, and the probability that it has affected the efficacy results is low. 
Overall, the investigated population represents the targeted population (patients with severe AA).   
Most of the patients (around 90%) in both placebo and treatment arms had prior therapy with 
systemic immunosuppressants/immunomodulator therapy or topical treatments. In total only 23, 33 
and 57 treatment naïve patients are included in placebo, baricitinib 2-mg and baricitinib 4-mg arms in 
pivotal studies, respectively. It is not expected that concomitant medication use had affected the final 
results. 
The primary endpoint was met (p<0.001) in both baricitinib treatment groups (both 4-mg and 2-mg 
dosing regimens) in both pivotal studies. The treatment effect calculated from pooled data analysis 
was 15.6 (95%CI: 11,20.5) and 29.9 (25.2,34.4) for baricitinib 2-mg and 4-mg, respectively. The 
proportion of patients achieving SALT ≤20 at W36 in treatment and placebo groups was slightly higher 
in JAHO phase 3 compared to JAIR study (around 3-4% higher). However, the effect size was 
comparable between the two studies. The effect size in baricitinib 2-mg group was significantly smaller 
than baricitinib 4-mg in both studies (16.4% and 14.7% compared to 29.9% and 29.9.% in JAHO and 
JAIR studies, respectively). The difference with placebo arm was still significant for the baricitinib 2-mg 
group.  The outcome of the sensitivity analyses was largely consistent with the outcome of the primary 
analysis.  
The majority of included patients were Caucasian. The response in Black/African American patients is 
comparable to the overall results. The 2 mg dosing regimen appears to be less effective and does not 
show a significant improvement compared to the placebo group. However, the numbers are limited, 
and no firm conclusions can be made. 
Numerous secondary and additional outcomes are calculated. ClinRO and PRO measures are essentially 
the same instrument measured by different investigators (physician or patient himself). Percentages of 
change in SALT score is more sensitive than dichotomous SALT, but that is not of additional value in 
these studies. Therefore the most relevant measures are considered to be the static SALT≤0 
(indicating almost full remission), which is almost similar to the change measure SALT90, the PRO Scalp 
instrument (indicating the amount of hair loss from the patient perspective) and ClinRO EB and EL 
(considering the importance of hair regrowth in eyebrows and eyelashes), for these outcomes efficacy 
was robust for baricitinib 2-mg and 4-mg. According to the results on the primary and key secondary 
outcomes, baricitinib 4-mg was more effective than 2-mg.   
The MAH has proposed a dose of 4-mg for the intended indication, in line with the efficacy results.  The 
4-mg dose was more effective than the 2-mg dose, but also, the lower dose can be considered more 
effective than placebo. Initially, no proposals were made for stopping treatment or down titration to 2-
Assessment report  
EMA/572597/2022  
Page 75/138 
 
 
 
 
mg in responding patients treated with baricitinib 4-mg, or for when to stop treatment in patients with 
an insufficient response. As the disease may recover spontaneously and given the safety profile of JAK 
inhibitors like baricitinib, the CHMP requested that guidance should be provided regarding treatment 
continuation and when to stop treatment.  
Accordingly, the Section 4.2 of the SmPC has been updated  to reflect that a dose of 2 mg once daily 
may be appropriate for patients such as those aged ≥ 75 years and for patients with a history of 
chronic or recurrent infections. A dose of 2 mg once daily may also be considered for patients who 
have achieved sustained control of disease activity with 4 mg once daily and are eligible for dose 
tapering. 
Because data of the stop and dose reduction sub-studies of the trials became available, the MAH 
provided data driven proposals. After down titration to 2-mg in responding patients, efficacy was 
reduced. In another sub-study, responders were re-randomised to stop or continuation of the 4-mg or 
2-mg dose. According to the results, only 33% and 20% of responders stayed in remission until week 
76 if baricitinib 4mg and 2mg were withdrawn, respectively. This indicates a higher chance of flare if 
treatment is stopped. Therefore, stopping baricitinib in case of maintained good response seems not 
advisable based on the efficacy results of the stop study since a majority of patients lost response 
within 24 weeks after discontinuation. On the other hand, considering the safety profile of baricitinib, 
the exposure should be reduced when possible. At the CHMP’s request, Section 4.2 of the SmPC was 
updated to include the following guidance which was considered acceptable to the CHMP: 
“Once a stable response has been achieved, it is recommended to continue treatment for at least 
several months, in order to avoid relapse. The benefit risk of treatment should be re assessed at 
regular intervals on an individual basis.” 
Overall, the additional efficacy endpoints have demonstrated a comparable trend as key secondary 
endpoints. Baricitinib 4-mg dose has shown more significant results than the 2-mg dosing regimen. For 
HADS at week 36, no subcategories were statistically different from placebo in baricitinib 2-mg group. 
The primary outcome has shown the efficacy of baricitinib 2-mg in regrowing the hair of scalp, the 
significance of which is not as much as 4-mg dosing regimen, and therefore additional endpoints in 
measuring the overall health of the patient score less than the primary endpoint. Some secondary and 
additional endpoints were not significant for the baricitinib 2-mg treatment group, especially in the 
JAIR study. For Skindex functioning and symptoms domain, no significant difference has been found 
between baricitinib 2-mg and placebo. 
There is support for the clinical relevance of the primary outcome (see the section on ‘design and 
conduct’ above). The PRO measures support the change in the extent of hair loss from the patient 
perspective, and patient and physician views aligned. In line with primary outcome, emotion and 
functioning domain of Skindex-AA show a reduction in baricitinib groups (proportionally better 
response in 4mg group) compared to the placebo. No minimal clinically important change has been 
defined by the MAH, which makes interpretations of these results difficult. However, it can be agreed 
that an overall better response has been observed in treatment groups, which is reassuring.  After 
stratification, it has been observed that females had a better response in symptom domain of Skindex-
AA and depression domain of HADS but slightly lesser response at emotion and functioning domains of 
Skindex-AA and Anxiety domain of HADS, compared to male patients, as cosmetic results are relatively 
more important for female patients. Improvement of all domains of Skindex-AA and HADS in females is 
considered reassuring. Patients with episodes <4 years and severe AA at baseline had better responses 
in all Skindex-AA domains. Only non-responders with very severe disease at baseline and/or duration 
of episode longer than 4 years and only in symptom domain of Skindex-AA had unfavourable results, 
which is expected. Other subgroups have shown a reduction in all Skindex-AA domains and HADS 
domains, which is in line with the overall results. 
Assessment report  
EMA/572597/2022

Subgroup analysis has shown that 4-mg dose is more effective compared to 2-mg dosing regimen.  
This included predefined subgroups of patients who: weigh more than 100kg; had impaired renal 
function; were older than 65 years status. Patients with severe AA at baseline had a better response 
(47.6%) compared to patients with very severe AA (21.3%). This is expected mainly because the 
primary endpoint is static and includes complete and near-complete hair regrowth. Long-term efficacy 
data shows response rate increase from 34% at week 36 to 39% at week 52 for 4-mg group. After 
week 52, responders were re-randomised for down-titration or continuation on 4mg. The results show 
that 96% of the patients who remained on baricitinib 4 mg and 74 % of the patients who were 
re-randomised to baricitinib 2 mg maintained their response week 76.  
Patients with a disease duration lower than 4 years had a better response compared to patients with a 
longer disease duration. This can be expected and is comparable in placebo and baricitinib 2-mg 
treatment groups. 
It has been demonstrated that improvement in SALT starts between week 8-16 of treatment and 
increases until week 36, with a higher response in the baricitinib 4-mg group. Secondary endpoints 
showed comparable results.  
Predictor analysis has shown that 36 weeks is a more appropriate time point to stop treatment in non-
responders than 24 weeks. Therefore, Section 4.2 of the SmPC has been updated as follows: 
“Consideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients who show no evidence of 
therapeutic benefit after 36 weeks of treatment.” 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In both pivotal studies in patients with severe AA, the primary endpoint (SALT≤20 at week 36) was 
met. The outcome of sensitivity analysis is largely consistent with the outcome of the primary analysis. 
The dosing regimen of 4-mg was more effective than the 2-mg dose, but also the lower dose was more 
effective than placebo, in the primary endpoint. These results were supported by the results on key 
secondary outcomes, notably by: the proportion of patients with a SALT90 at week 36; the proportion 
of patients with a PRO Scalp Hair Assessment score of 0 or 1 with a ≥2-point improvement; and the 
proportions of patients with a response (0 or 1 with ≥2-point improvement) on the eyebrow or eyelash 
hair growth. Clinical relevance of the treatment effects is supported by the definition SALT≤20 as a 
clinically relevant treatment effect by patients and physicians in the development of SALT. Subgroup 
analysis by gender shows robust effects.  
The statistical methods and analysis populations are considered acceptable.  
The CHMP concluded that the efficacy data supports the following indication: Baricitinib is indicated for 
the treatment of severe alopecia areata in adult patients (see section 5.1). 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Olumiant is available as 2-mg and 4-mg tablets. It is currently indicated to treat adult Rheumatoid 
arthritis and adult Atopic dermatitis (it is referred to the SmPC for more details). The currently known 
safety profile, contra-indications and warnings, are coming from those two indications. 
Contra-indications 
Assessment report  
EMA/572597/2022  
Page 77/138 
 
 
 
 
 
Baricitinib is contra-indicated in pregnancy and in known cases of hypersensitivity to the active 
substance or any of the excipients. 
Warnings 
The SmPC includes warnings regarding the occurrence of infections, viral reactivation, haematological 
abnormalities, venous thromboembolism, lipids, hepatic transaminase elevations, malignancy, 
hypersensitivity, diverticulitis. The SmPC also includes warnings regarding vaccination, guidance for 
laboratory monitoring (lipids, absolute neutrophil count, absolute lymphocyte count, haemoglobin, 
hepatic transaminases), concomitant treatment with other immunosuppressive drugs. 
Baricitinib is associated with an increased rate of infections such as upper respiratory tract infections 
compared to placebo. In patients with active, chronic or recurrent infections, the risks and benefits of 
treatment with Olumiant should be carefully considered. If an infection develops and the patient is not 
responding to standard therapy, treatment with baricitinib should be temporarily interrupted. 
In relation to haematological abnormalities, treatment should not be initiated, or should be temporarily 
interrupted, in patients with an ANC < 1 x 109 cells/L, ALC < 0.5 x 109 cells/L or haemoglobin < 8 
g/dL. 
Cases of viral reactivation, including herpes virus reactivation, were reported in clinical studies.  
Dose-dependent increases in hepatic transaminase (ALT and AST) were reported in patients treated 
with baricitinib compared to placebo. If drug-induced liver injury is suspected, treatment with 
baricitinib should be temporarily interrupted. 
Events of venous thromboembolism (deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) have been 
reported in patients receiving baricitinib. Olumiant should be used with caution in patients with risk 
factors for DVT/PE, such as older age, obesity, a medical history of DVT/PE, or patients undergoing 
surgery and immobilisation. If clinical features of DVT/PE occur, Olumiant should be discontinued. 
Unfavourable effects 
In patients with Rheumatoid arthritis and with Atopic dermatitis, the most commonly reported Adverse 
drug reactions were increased LDL cholesterol, upper respiratory tract infections, and headache. 
Among the ‘common’ Adverse drug reactions are viral reactivation (herpes) and pneumonia, while 
deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism were ‘uncommon’.  
Overview of safety data 
This application includes safety data from baricitinib treated adult patients with severe AA from two 
multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Study JAHO is an adaptive Phase 2 
and Phase 3 study, and study JAIR is a Phase 3 study. The safety population is defined as all patients 
who received at least 1 dose of study treatment. 
Safety data are included from the 36-week placebo-controlled periods and from the extended period 
including week 52, with database cut off dates of 23 August 2021 for Study JAHO and 30 August 2021 
for Study JAIR.  
Adverse events were classified based on the MedDRA Version 23.1. A TEAE was defined as an event 
that first occurred or worsened in severity after baseline during the analysis period. The analysis period 
is defined as the treatment period plus up to 30 days after the last dose date of the study drug.

The data sets of both trials were integrated for the safety assessment (Table 29). The data set ‘BARI 
AA PC’ includes the 36 weeks placebo-controlled periods and includes placebo, baricitinib 2-mg and 4-
mg. Data set ‘Ext BARI AA’ includes all data from randomisation up to data cut-off, censored at dose or 
treatment change. The ‘All BARI AA’ set includes all doses of baricitinib, 1 mg, 2-mg and 4-mg. 
In addition, a pooled RA/AD/AA dataset, which includes all RA and AD patients treated with baricitinib 
in the16-week placebo-controlled periods, and all AA patients treated with baricitinib in the 36-week 
placebo-controlled period, was used to determine the frequency of Adverse Drug Reactions. 
Patient exposure 
As of the data cut-off date of 31 March 2021, the AA safety database included 1244 patients exposed 
to baricitinib at any dose. Overall exposure was 1362 patient-years. The database included 845 (68%) 
patients with at least 52 weeks of cumulative exposure to baricitinib at any dose, and 516 (55%) 
patients treated with baricitinib 4-mg who completed at least 52 weeks of treatment. 
A total of 28 patients were exposed to baricitinib 1-mg, in the phase 2 portion of study JAHO. A total of 
564 patients were exposed to baricitinib 2-mg for 488.9 PY and a total of 938 patients were exposed to 
baricitinib 4-mg for 858.9 PY. Patients with 52 weeks of exposure (at least 358 days) were: 317 
patients (All BARI 2-mg) and 516 patients (All BARI 4-mg). 
In the 36-week placebo-controlled comparison, there were 371 patients exposed to placebo, 365 
patients exposed to baricitinib 2-mg, and 540 exposed to baricitinib 4-mg (Table 30). About 90% in all 
three treatment groups were exposed for at least 36 weeks and about 87% were exposed to baricitinib 
for at least 52 weeks (extended BARI AA).

Adverse events 
Summary of Adverse Events 
In the 36-week placebo-controlled period, the frequencies of TEAEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to 
permanent discontinuation from study drug were numerically higher in the baricitinib groups compared 
to placebo (Table 31). Most TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. The frequency of TEAEs, SAEs 
and of severe TEAEs was highest in the baricitinib 4-mg group, in the placebo-controlled data as well 
as in the extended data set.

Common adverse events 
Common TEAEs are defined as those reported at a frequency of greater than or equal to 2%, before 
rounding in any treatment group, including placebo. The occurrence of common TEAEs is presented in 
Table 33. 
In the placebo controlled phase, usually the ‘common AEs’ occurred most frequently in the baricitinib 
4-mg group, numerically somewhat less in the 2-mg group, and least in the placebo group, with some 
exceptions (Table 33). The most common AEs that were numerically more frequent in baricitinib 
treatment groups included (placebo versus 2-mg versus 4-mg): upper respiratory tract infections 
(7.0% vs 6.6% vs 7.6%) and viral upper respiratory tract infections (1.6% vs 2.2% vs 1.5%), 
nasopharyngitis (5.1% vs 4.4% vs 6.9%), headache (5.4% vs 5.5% vs 6.7%), acne (1.1% vs 5.8% vs 
5.6%), blood CPK increased (1.3% vs 0.8% vs 4.3%), urinary tract infection (1.6% vs 3.8% vs 3.3%), 
influenza (1.9% vs 1.6% vs 2.6%), fatigue (1.1% vs 0.8% vs 2.2%), folliculitis (0.8% vs 1.4 vs 
2.2%), nausea (1.6% vs 2.7% vs 2.0%) and vulvovaginal candidiasis (0% vs 2.6% vs 1.2%).

Serious adverse events and deaths 
No deaths were reported in the AA clinical trial programme through the data cut-off date. 
Serious AEs were reported according to the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E2A 
guidelines (ICH 1994).  
In the 36-Week placebo-controlled period, in the baricitinib 2-mg and 4-mg groups there were 2.2% 
and 2.6% of patients reporting at least one SAE, compared to 1.6% in the placebo group (Table 34). 
Over the extended treatment period, most (≥3 patients) SAEs were in the Injury, poisoning and 
procedural complications, Infections and infestations, Cardiac Disorders and Gastrointestinal disorders 
SOCs.  
Within the Injury, poisoning and procedural complications SOC, fractures were the most frequently 
reported SAEs for baricitinib-treated patients. In the placebo-controlled period, there were 3 fractures 
reported in the placebo group, fractures in 8 patients in the baricitinib 2-mg group and in 7 patients in 
the baricitinib 4-mg group. In the extended data set, 11 patients on 2-mg (3.0%) and 12 patients on 
4-mg (2.2%) of baricitinib reported fractures. 
In the Infections SOC, two events of pyelonephritis were reported, one in each baricitinib dose group. 
There were 6 cases of Covid-19 in the All BARI data set, 3 of them with pneumonia. In the extended 
data set there were SAE’s of diverticulitis (n=1), appendicitis (n=2), appendicitis perforated (n=1), 
and a SAE of herpes zoster in the baricitinib 4-mg group. Pneumonia, diverticulitis and herpes zoster 
are known as ADRs of baricitinib, gastrointestinal perforation is an important identified risk. 
In the SOC for Cardiac disorders, there were 4 SAEs reported: ventricular tachycardia, acute 
myocardial infarction, congestive cardiac failure, aortic valve incompetence, in the baricitinib groups 
and none in the placebo group (Table 34). 
The SAEs in the Gastrointestinal disorders SOC were diverse, though 2 were gastric in nature (gastric 
stenosis, obstruction gastric) in the baricitinib 2-mg group (Table 34), apart from the three 
appendicitis cases alluded to above in the infections paragraph. Regarding Hepatobiliary disorders, 
there was one SAE of acute cholecystitis in the placebo group and two in the baricitinib groups, with an 
additional SAE of acute hepatitis in the extended BARI data set (Table 34). 
There were two cases of Venous thrombotic events (one Pulmonary embolism and one Deep vein 
thrombosis) that both occurred after database lock. VTE is a known ADR of baricitinib. 
For a complete listing of the important potential risks of baricitinib it is referred to Table 34. In the 
baricitinib groups and seen over the All BARI data set: there was one SAE of B-cell lymphoma; there 
were serious infections but there was no occurrence of tuberculosis or serious candida infections or 
PML; three SAEs of acute hepatitis/acute cholecystitis; two SAEs that refer to MACE (acute myocardial 
infection and congestive heart failure); two cases of venous thrombotic events; one case of gastro-
intestinal perforation. In the baricitinib treated groups there were no SAEs of myelosuppression, or of 
myopathy including rhabdomyolysis. Pregnancy outcomes are discussed in the section on ‘Special 
populations’ further below.

Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Safety topics of special interest were selected and closely monitored in the ‘phase 3’ studies based on: 
the established safety profile in the RA and AD indications for baricitinib; the baricitinib Phase 2 clinical 
study in AA; the mechanism of action for baricitinib; information from literature. 
The safety topics of special interest discussed by the MAH in the SCS are: infections, haematologic 
changes, lipid increases, MACE, VTE, ATE, CPK increases and muscle-related symptoms, NMSC and 
malignancy other than NMSC, abnormal hepatic tests, effects on renal function, GI perforation, 
depression and suicidality, allergic reactions or hypersensitivity, and photosensitivity reactions. 
Infections, including opportunistic infections 
The mode-of-action of baricitinib could lead to an increased sensibility to acquire infections in users. 
The SmPC of baricitinib includes infection in the Warnings and Precautions section, upper respiratory 
tract infections, herpes, gastroenteritis, urinary tract infections, and pneumonia are ADR, and serious 
infections are an important potential risk of baricitinib. In the AA clinical programme, patients were 
excluded if they had 
•  history of eczema herpeticum in the last 12 months or 2 previous episodes, or 
• 
current or recent and/or clinically serious viral, bacterial, fungal, or parasitic infection. 
Potential opportunistic infections (OIs) were identified using a list of MedDRA PTs, in line with the 
consensus recommendations for reporting OIs (Winthrop et al. 2015). There were 3 modifications 
to this approach: 
•  Candidiasis infections involving only the oral cavity and pharynx were not considered OIs; 
except if also involving infection of the oesophagus or below. 
• 
• 
Localised herpes zoster infections were not considered OIs; only multidermatomal or 
disseminated infections, or both, were considered OIs. 
Treatment-emergent, active TB infection was considered an OI. 
In the placebo-controlled period, there were no large differences between placebo and baricitinib 
treatment groups for Treatment-Emergent infections, serious infections, temporary interruptions, and 
permanent discontinuations of study drug due to infections (Table 35). Infections that were reported 
by more than 1% of patients in any baricitinib group and that were more frequent with baricitinib 
compared to placebo were urinary tract infection, folliculitis, bronchitis, herpes zoster, and 
vulvovaginal candidiasis. Differences were not significant except for vulvovaginal candidiasis. No 
patients with placebo and 3 patients in the baricitinib groups reported serious infections.  
These were a pyelonephritis with baricitinib 2-mg and baricitinib 4-mg each, and a COVID-19 
pneumonia with baricitinib 2-mg, which did not result in study drug discontinuation. All patients 
recovered. 
Herpes zoster was the most frequently reported infection resulting in a temporary interruption of study 
drug in baricitinib-treated patients as mandated in the protocol. One patient discontinued study drug 
due to infection (a patient with lower respiratory tract infection in the baricitinib 2-mg group). 
In the Extended BARI AA analysis set, no dose differences were seen for TE infections, serious 
infections, temporary interruptions, and discontinuations from study drug due to infections (Table 35). 
The IRs of TE infections in the baricitinib 2-mg and 4-mg dose groups of the Extended BARI AA 
analysis set were similar to or lower compared to the respective dose groups in the placebo-controlled

No confirmed Opportunistic Infections and no TB infections were reported in the AA clinical trials. 
The established safety profile for baricitinib includes viral reactivation, including Herpes virus 
reactivation in the Warnings and Precautions section, and herpes zoster is a recognised ADR for 
baricitinib. Patients were excluded from the AA clinical trial programme if they had a symptomatic 
herpes zoster infection within 12 weeks prior to screening or if they had a history of disseminated or 
complicated herpes zoster. If patients developed herpes zoster during the course of the study, the 
protocol mandated temporary interruption of study drug. The established safety profile for baricitinib 
includes viral reactivation in the Warnings and Precautions section. This includes herpes virus 
reactivation and hepatitis infections. In the placebo-controlled data set and in the extended BARI data 
set,  no patients had detectable postbaseline HBV DNA. In the all BARI data set 2 cases of positivity of 
HBV DNA occurred, but no patients had a reactivation of HBV. 
In the placebo-controlled period, Herpes zoster infections were numerically more frequent with 
baricitinib 2-mg and baricitinib 4-mg compared to placebo (Table 36). No dose differences were 
observed. All were localised non-multidermatomal infections of mild or moderate severity. No patient 
reported a severe or serious herpes zoster infection or discontinued study drug due to the infection. 
In the Extended BARI AA analysis set, no dose differences were observed for herpes zoster infections 
(Table 36). The IRs of TE herpes zoster in the baricitinib 2-mg and 4-mg dose groups of the Extended

BARI AA analysis set were similar to the respective dose groups in the placebo-controlled period. All 
were localised non-multidermatomal infections. One patient, treated with baricitinib 4-mg, reported a 
severe herpes zoster infection of 9 days duration that was also serious. The patient recovered. 
Herpes simplex is a recognised ADR for baricitinib. Patients were excluded from the AA clinical trial 
programme if they had a history of eczema herpeticum in the last 12 months or 2 previous episodes or 
if they had a symptomatic herpes simplex infection at the time of randomisation. In the placebo-
controlled phase, the occurrence of herpes simplex (oral herpes, genital herpes, herpes simplex, 
genital herpes simplex) was more frequent in the placebo group as compared to baricitinib 2-mg and 
4-mg (3.2% vs 2.5% vs 1.3%). In the extended BARI AA set, the IRs for the herpes simplex cluster 
were similar for both dose groups.

Note: IRs are calculated based on PYR. 
In the 36-Week placebo-controlled period, there appears to be a higher frequency of folliculitis with 
baricitinib 2-mg (1.4%, IR 2.1) and baricitinib 4-mg (2.2%, IR 3.3) compared to placebo (0.8%, IR 
1.2). The IRs of folliculitis were 1.5 with baricitinib 2-mg and 2.4 with baricitinib 4-mg and are similar 
to or lower than what was observed in the placebo-controlled period. In the All BARI AA analysis set, 
the IRs of folliculitis were 1.4 in the All BARI 2-mg AA analysis set, and 2.5 in the All BARI 4-mg AA 
analysis set. Of the 32 patients who reported folliculitis in the All BARI AA analysis set: the scalp was 
involved in 75% of patients, no events were serious or severe and 87% were mild and 13% were of 
moderate intensity. The majority of the folliculitis cases on the scalp (71%) occurred in patients who 
were experiencing scalp hair re growth at the time of the event or who became responders shortly 
thereafter. Most (70%) of patients recovered or were recovering from their folliculitis, and no patient 
interrupted or discontinued study drug due to the AE. 
Folliculitis may have infectious causes or may be due to irritation of the hair follicle from regrowing 
hair. The hair follicle has a particular microbiome, different from the microbiome observed at the skin 
surface. Dysregulation of the hair follicle microbiome has been reported as a potential cause, or 
consequence, of the inflammatory process involved in AA pathogenesis (Lousada et al. 2021). Given 
that the majority of folliculitis cases in the All BARI AA analysis set involved the scalp, according to the 
MAH it can be hypothesised that these folliculitis cases are linked to a change in the local microbiome 
in response to the resolution of the inflammation in the follicle, or secondary to a mechanical irritation 
by the regrowing hair. The mechanical irritation would then be similar to the situation described as 
pseudofolliculitis on various body areas after shaving or waxing, when the growing hair does not exit 
Assessment report

correctly through the ostium (Khanna et al. 2013; Gray and McMichael 2016). If folliculitis was 
indicative of infections due to local immunosuppression, the MAH anticipates that it would affect 
various areas of the body and would be observed in a comparable manner among responders and non-
responders. In the AD and RA indications, where the recovery of the hair follicle does not play a role, 
the frequency of folliculitis was similar in baricitinib- and placebo-treated patients and no dose-
response was noted. 
In the 36-Week placebo-controlled period, vulvovaginal candidiasis and mycotic infections as a cluster 
term were reported more frequently with baricitinib 2-mg and baricitinib 4-mg compared to placebo : 
0.5% (n=1, IR=0.7) vs 3.0% (n=7, IR=4.7) vs 3.0% (n=7, IR=3.1). In the extended BARI set, the 
IRs for baricitinib 2-mg and 4-mg were similar  (IR=2.6 and IR=2.0, respectively) , which was also 
seen in the All BARI data set. Of the 22 patients reporting 26 events in the All BARI AA analysis set: no 
events were serious or severe, 69% were mild, and 31% were of moderate intensity. All patients 
except 1 recovered, and no patient interrupted or permanently discontinued study drug due to the AE. 
When considering data from the AD and RA populations, in AD no patients reported vulvovaginal 
candidiasis in the 16-week placebo-controlled period in the baricitinib groups, compared to 1 patient in 
the placebo group. Furthermore, there was 1 patient with vulvovaginal mycotic infection in the 
baricitinib 4-mg group in AD and no patients in the baricitinib 2-mg and placebo groups. In the 16-
week placebo-controlled period in RA, the frequency of vulvovaginal candidiasis was higher with 
baricitinib (2-mg: 0.8%, 4-mg: 0.5%) compared to placebo (0%) but overall low. The frequencies of 
vulvovaginal mycotic infection were not higher with baricitinib (2-mg: 0.3%, 4-mg: 0.1%) compared 
to placebo (0.5%). 
Given that vulvovaginal candidiasis and mycotic infections (cluster term) were reported by only 1 
patient each in the baricitinib and placebo groups in the placebo-controlled period in AD, that 
differences between treatment groups were small for RA and that no dose response was observed, the 
differences between treatment groups in the AA clinical trials were not considered causally associated 
with baricitinib treatment. 
Haematologic changes 
Treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities occurring at any time during the treatment period and 
shift tables of baseline to maximum Grade during the treatment period were tabulated. Planned and 
unplanned measurements were included. Box plots for mean changes from baseline at scheduled visit 
had also been provided (not shown). 
This section concentrates on the haematologic changes: neutrophil count decreased, lymphocyte count 
decreased, haemoglobin level decreased, and platelet count increased. Neutropenia and 
thrombocytosis are known ARDs of baricitinib and there are warnings for increased infections with the 
use of baricitinib, and not to use baricitinib with low haemoglobin levels. 
In the placebo-controlled period, decreased neutrophil count and lymphocyte count, decreased 
haemoglobin levels, and increased platelet counts were more frequent in the baricitinib 4-mg and 2-
mg as compared to placebo, in a dose-dependent way (Table 37). The IRs remained similar, or 
reduced somewhat, in the extended BARI set as compared to the placebo-controlled set. 
In the All BARI AA analysis set, 13 patients (1%, IR 0.9) reported TEAEs of anaemia: no events were 
serious, all events were mild to moderate in severity. Two patients temporarily interrupted study drug 
due to anaemia. One patient with a Grade 4 haemoglobin shift discontinued study drug due to 
anaemia. 
Confounders or alternative causes were present in 12 of the 13 patients who reported anaemia and 
included medical history of GI bleeding, vitamin B12 deficiency, haemoglobinopathy, anaemia, and iron

deficiency. Other patients had low haemoglobin at baseline, or anaemia was associated with vaginal 
bleeding, liposuction, and penicillin use or with dysmenorrhoea. 
Although low haemoglobin and related haematology analyte changes were seen with a higher 
frequency in baricitinib-treated patients compared to placebo and more frequently in the baricitinib 4-
mg compared to the 2-mg group, most haemoglobin increases were to CTCAE Grade 1 or 2, and mean 
decreases from baseline were small and not clinically meaningful. Anaemia is a common comorbidity 
reported in the literature in the AA population. In the All BARI AA analysis set, the IR of anaemia was 
0.9 per 100 PYR, and all events were nonserious and mild or moderate in intensity. The majority of 
patients with Grade ≥2 shifts in haemoglobin had confounding factors or alternative causes.

Notes: Percentages for CTCAE increases are based on number of patients at risk for specified abnormality. IRs are 
calculated based on PYE. 
Blood lipid changes 
Hypercholesterolaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia are recognised as ADRs for baricitinib. Lipid 
parameters were assessed 12 weeks following the initiation of baricitinib in the AA clinical programme. 
An increase of mean LDL-C, HDL-C, and, consequently, total cholesterol was observed in the first 12 
weeks of treatment with baricitinib. Compared to the placebo group, there were no differences in mean 
triglycerides nor in percentage of categorical shifts for triglycerides. 
Although some increases in mean LDL-C were seen after Week 12 in both baricitinib 2-mg and 4-mg 
groups, the proportion of patients with shifts to high or very high LDL-C after Week 12, with a normal 
level at baseline and Week 12, was small (1.5% in the baricitinib 4-mg group at Week 36).  
In the baricitinib 4-mg group, AEs of hyperlipidaemia were more frequently reported than in the 
placebo and 2-mg groups, which had similar frequencies. With a longer exposure, the IR in the 
baricitinib 4-mg group went from 10.2 in the placebo-controlled period to 7.7 in the Extended BARI AA 
analysis set.  
Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events 
MACE were identified by the investigative site or through medical review and were sent to a blinded, 
external Clinical Event Committee for adjudication. These events included: potential MACE 
(cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke), other cardiovascular events (transient 
ischaemic attack, hospitalisation for unstable angina, hospitalisation for heart failure, serious 
arrhythmia, resuscitated sudden death, cardiogenic shock, and coronary revascularizations), VTEs and 
ATEs, and non-cardiovascular deaths. 
In the placebo-controlled period, there was 1 MACE that occurred in the baricitinib 2-mg group. 
•  A reported acute myocardial infarction approximately 9 months after starting baricitinib 2-mg. 
The patient had multiple risk factors such as current tobacco use, obesity (BMI 34 kg/m2 at 
baseline), hypercholesterolaemia, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension (treated with lisinopril). 
The patient had low HDL-C and high triglycerides at study entry. Study drug was interrupted 
for 4 days while patient underwent a coronary revascularization procedure (reported as other 
cardiovascular event) and then resumed. The patient recovered from the event. 
There were 2 other cardiovascular events, both serious arrythmias.  
•  One case of ventricular tachycardia in a patient with obesity (BMI 32 kg/m2 at baseline) was 
reported 15 weeks after the start of baricitinib.The patient was randomly assigned to the 4-mg 
dose but received the 2-mg dose due to renal impairment (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2). The 
patient had hyperlipidaemia and palpitations in the medical history and was taking multiple 
concomitant medications including fexofenadine and epinephrine. The patient reported AEs of 
sinus tachycardia and palpitations 9 weeks into the study that were ongoing at the time of the 
SAE of ventricular tachycardia. The patient discontinued study drug due to the SAE and then 
discontinued from the study. The patient recovered from the event after 6 days. 
•  One case of ventricular extrasystoles in a, overweight, patient was reported 18 weeks after the 
starting baricitinib 4-mg. The medical history did not mention any cardiac disorder, and was 
Assessment report  
EMA/572597/2022

not taking any concomitant medication in the 3 weeks before the start of the event. The 
patient had not recovered from the event. No action was taken with study drug. An AE of acute 
stress disorder was reported 1 week later that was ongoing at the time of the data cutoff date. 
This cardiovascular event was positively adjudicated as serious arrythmia after the database 
lock for the placebo-controlled period and was included here for completeness. 
In the Extended baricitinib 2-mg and 4-mg AA analysis set and in the All BARI AA analysis set, one 
additional cardiovascular event was reported (aortic valve incompetence, non-MACE). 
Venous thrombotic events 
Pulmonary embolism and DVT are recognised as ADRs for baricitinib, and VTE is an important potential 
risk for baricitinib. Patients with a history of VTE or at high risk for VTE were excluded from the AA 
clinical studies. Possible VTEs were identified by the investigative site or through medical review and 
were sent to a blinded, external Clinical Event Committee for adjudication, as described above in the 
MACE search strategy. There have been 2 patients with SAEs of VTE in the AA clinical trial programme 
after the database cutoff dates for the updated safety database, one case of PE and one of DVT/PE, 
both patients were treated with baricitinib 2 mg. The patient with DVT/PE also had obesity (BMI 35.8) 
and used oral contraceptives, the other patient with PE concomitantly had COVID-19 pneumonia and 
acute respiratory failure, and also a genetic predisposition (prothrombine gene heterozygosity (c.*97 
G>A variant).  
Creatine Phosphokinase Changes and Muscle-Related Symptoms 
CPK increases of more than 5 x ULN are recognised as ADRs for baricitinib. No relationship to muscle 
symptoms was identified in the baricitinib RA and AD clinical programmes. In the AA clinical studies, 
treatment-emergent AEs related to increased CPK were reviewed to identify any additional elevations 
in CPK that were not captured by laboratory values. 
In the placebo-controlled period, the percentage of patients with any CTCAE grade increase (reflecting 
an increase in CPK) was higher in baricitinib 2-mg and baricitinib 4-mg compared to placebo, and 
dose-related differences were observed (Table 38). Most increases were to Grade 1 or 2. 
In the Extended BARI AA analysis set, the percentage of patients with any CTCAE grade increase 
(reflecting an increase in CPK) was higher in the baricitinib 4-mg group compared to the baricitinib 2-
mg group, and frequencies for both doses were higher in the Extended BARI AA analysis set compared 
to the placebo-controlled period. The IRs for baricitinib 4-mg were numerically higher than for 2-mg 
dose.

Adverse Events; IR = incidence rate; n = number of patients in the specified category; N = number of patients in 
the safety analysis set; PYE = patient-years of exposure. 
Notes: Percentages for CTCAE increases are based on number of patients at risk for specified abnormality. IRs are 
calculated based on PYE. 
Treatment-emergent AEs identified by the Rhabdomyolysis/myopathy SMQ were reviewed to 
determine if the patient had an increased CPK at or near the time of the event onset. If an increased 
CPK was identified, the patient’s data were medically reviewed to see if the patient reported an AE that 
was clearly associated with the CPK elevation. 
In the placebo-controlled period, the percentages and numbers of patients who reported 1 or more 
TEAE potentially related to muscle symptoms/with accompanying elevations in CPK were: n=3/0 on 
placebo, n=3/1 on baricitinib 2-mg, and n=5/3 on baricitinib 4-mg.  In the placebo group, of the 3 
patients with reported muscle symptoms there was 1 patient with rhabdomyolysis and normal CPK. 
Rhabdomyolysis did not occur in the other treatment groups. In the baricitinib 4-mg group, most (4/5) 
of the patients had muscle spasms, and there was 1 patient with myalgia. 
In the extended treatment period, in the baricitinib 2-mg group there were 4 additional patients 
reporting muscle symptoms, which included 2 patients with muscle spasms and 2 patients with 
myalgia; three of the patients had a raised CPK. In the baricitinib 4-mg group, 5 additional patients 
reported muscle symptoms, which included 1 patient with muscle spasms, 3 patients with myalgia, and 
1 patient with myofascial pain syndrome; all with normal CPK. 
In the All BARI AA analysis set, there were 20 patients with TEAEs related to muscle symptoms (IR 
1.2) and 35% (7/20) had an associated increases in CPK. The IRs were similar for the All BARI 2-mg 
(IR 1.5) and All BARI 4-mg (IR 1.0) analysis sets. 
Most (65%, 13/20) of the patients reported a muscle AE that did not coincide with a CPK increase. The 
events for TEAEs related to muscle symptoms in All BARI AA were (35%, 7/20): 
•  4 of the 7 patients with coincident muscle AEs and CPK increases had an increase to CTCAE 
Grade 3 or greater. Of these, 2 patients reported engaging in intense physical exercise near 
the time of the CPK increase and 2 patients denied any physical exercise.

• 
The 3 remaining patients had CTCAE increases to Grade 1 and one of these patients reported 
engaging in physical exercise. 
An analysis was performed in the n=64 patients with a CPK >5 x ULN (Grade 3 or Grade 4) at any 
time in the All BARI AA analysis set. The mean age of patients was 32 years and ~50% were female. 
In these group, 64% (41/64) of patients had normal baseline CPK. Time to onset of the >5 x ULN was 
a mean of 238.0 days, a median of 249.0 days, and a range of 29 to 561 days. Creatine 
phosphokinase returned to baseline values in 81% of patients, and the mean time to return to baseline 
was 34 days, with a range of 7 to 223 days. Three patients temporarily interrupted treatment (4.7%) 
due to CPK laboratory results, and no patient permanently discontinued treatment as a result of the 
increased CPK. Seven patients reported muscular symptoms, 4 of them (6.2%) from the 
Rhabdomyolysis/myopathy SMQ. 
Malignancies 
Malignancies were identified using terms from the malignant tumours SMQ (20000194). Malignancies 
excluding NMSCs and NMSCs are reported separately. 
The number of malignancies (n=3) and NMSC (n=2) in the AA programme was small in patients 
exposed to baricitinib for over 104 weeks (13%) in the All BARI AA analysis set, with 490 days of 
mean exposure (Table 39). In the placebo-controlled period, one event of prostate cancer was 
reported for placebo and 1 event of B-cell lymphoma was reported for baricitinib 4-mg. In the 
Extended BARI AA analysis set, breast cancer had occurred in a patient of the baricitinib 4-mg group. 
Also in the Extended BARI AA analysis set, for two patients in the baricitinib 2-mg group NMSC was 
reported, and there was one case of B-cell lymphoma also on 2-mg of baricitinib.

Abnormal hepatic tests 
ALT and AST increases of 3 or more times the ULN are recognised as ADRs for baricitinib; with  
hepatotoxicity being an important potential risk for baricitinib. 
In the placebo-controlled period, mean AST and ALT in the baricitinib 4-mg group increased slightly 
over the duration of the placebo-controlled period (+2.6 IU for ALT and +3.1 for AST) while the 
median remained stable (+1 IU for ALT and +2 IU for AST). The mean and median values in the 2-mg

group remained stable and similar to the mean in the placebo group. The frequency of an increase of 
ALT or AST to ≥3 x ULN and ≥5 x ULN was lower in the baricitinib groups than in the placebo group 
(Table 40). 
There were no elevations of bilirubin ≥2 x ULN in the 2-mg group, and in the 4-mg group, the 
frequency was uncommon and similar to the placebo group. Elevations of ALP ≥1.5 x ULN were more 
frequent in the 2-mg group than in the placebo and 4-mg groups, but the frequency in the baricitinib 
4-mg group was uncommon and not increased compared to the placebo group. 
In the Extended BARI AA analysis sets, there were 5 patients with increases in AST ≥5 x ULN in the 4-
mg group and 2 additional patients in the 2-mg group. There were 2 patients with increases in ALT ≥5 
x ULN, one each in the 2-mg and 4-mg dose groups. Among all these cases, there was 1 patient on 4-
mg with an AE of acute hepatitis; this case will be further discussed in this section as potentially 
meeting Hy’s Law criteria. The other cases reported no AEs associated with the transaminase increase. 
There were 4 cases of increase of ALT or AST ≥10 x ULN in the All BARI 4-mg analysis set. 
There was 1 patient  who met the laboratory criteria for potential Hy’s Law (SCS APP.2.7.4.7.9.8.1). 
This had ALT, AST, and ALP >5 x ULN, and total bilirubin >2 x ULN, 13 months after starting baricitinib 
4-mg. Internal The MAH liver and infection experts concluded that the hepatic abnormality was due to 
syphilitic hepatitis secondary to a preexisting syphilis infection. 
Alanine aminotransferase, AST, and ALP were normal at entry into the study and up to the event. A 
rash was diagnosed 3 weeks after the presentation of the hepatitis event as syphilis based on a 
positive treponema test and the histology of the skin lesions. The patient recovered from the liver 
injury, and liver enzymes were within normal limits 4 weeks after the start of the penicillin treatment, 
which supported the syphilitic aetiology of the hepatic injury.

Laboratory findings 
Laboratory findings for haematological changes (neutrophils, lymphocytes, haemoglobin, and 
platelets),  lipid changes, CPK elevations, abnormal hepatic tests are discussed in the section on 
AESI’s. 
The chemistry, haematology, immunoglobulin, and urinalysis analytes discussed in this section are 
those where significant differences were observed in frequency and for which frequencies were higher: 
in the baricitinib groups compared to the placebo group or in the baricitinib 4-mg compared to the 
baricitinib 2-mg group in the placebo-controlled or Extended BARI AA analysis set. 
In the placebo-controlled period, the percentages of patients with TE high serum albumin were higher 
in the baricitinib groups compared to the placebo group: 1.4% (IR 2.1) on placebo, 3.9% (IR 5.8) on 
baricitinib 2-mg, and 5.0% (IR 7.2) on baricitinib 4-mg. The maximum mean increases from baseline 
in serum albumin were: no increases seen in placebo, 0.66 g/L on baricitinib 2-mg, and 0.85 g/L on 
baricitinib 4-mg.  
In the Extended BARI AA analysis set before the data update, incidence rates for TE high serum 
albumin were: IR 3.7 on baricitinib 2-mg, and IR 5.6 on baricitinib 4-mg. 
In the placebo-controlled period, the percentage of patients with TE low monocytes was higher in the 
baricitinib 4-mg group compared to the placebo and baricitinib 2-mg groups: 10.7% (IR 14.8) on 
placebo, 11.7% (IR 15.8) on baricitinib 2-mg, and 17.1% (IR 22.8) on baricitinib 4-mg. The maximum 
mean decreases from baseline in monocytes were small, with -0.01 × 109/L on placebo, no decreases 
in baricitinib 2-mg, and -0.01 × 109/L on baricitinib 4-mg. 
In the Extended BARI AA analysis set, the IRs of TE low monocytes were higher in the baricitinib 4-mg 
compared to the baricitinib 2-mg group: 12.6 on baricitinib 2-mg, and 20.2 on baricitinib 4-mg. 
Vital signs 
Blood pressure 
In the placebo-controlled period, the frequency of high systolic blood pressure was numerically higher 
in baricitinib-treated patients compared to placebo with no dose differences. Hypertension as a PT was 
reported at similar frequency with placebo (2.4%) and baricitinib 4-mg (2.6%) and less frequently with 
baricitinib 2-mg (0.5%). Maximum mean changes from baseline in baricitinib-treated patients were 
small (less than 2 mm Hg) for both dose groups. No differences among treatment groups were noted 
for high systolic blood pressure; maximum mean changes from baseline in baricitinib-treated patients 
were small (less than 1 mm Hg) for both dose groups. 
Pulse 
Assessment report

In the placebo-controlled period, the frequency of low pulse rate was similar with baricitinib 4-mg and 
placebo, and lower with baricitinib 2-mg. High pulse rate was numerically more frequent in baricitinib-
treated patients compared to placebo. Maximum mean changes from baseline in baricitinib-treated 
patients were small (less than 2 bpm) and did not increase compared to placebo-treated patients (2.57 
bpm) for both dose groups.  
Weight 
In the placebo-controlled period, the frequency of weight loss (≥7% decrease) was higher with placebo 
compared to the baricitinib 2-mg and 4-mg groups. A similar proportion of patients across all 
treatment groups had weight gain of ≥7%. Weight increased as a PT was reported at higher frequency 
in the baricitinib 2-mg (1.6%) and 4-mg (0.9%) groups compared to placebo (0.3%). Maximum mean 
changes from baseline were 1.15 kg with baricitinib 2-mg and 1.78 kg with baricitinib 4-mg compared 
to 0.62 kg with placebo. 
Safety in special populations 
Age 
Age categories were defined as <65 years and ≥65 years. Study inclusion criteria was at least 18 
years and ≤60 years for males, and ≤70 years for females at the time of informed consent. In total, 
out of 1244 patients, there were: 1214 (97.6%) patients aged less than 65 years, and 30 (2.4%) 
patients aged 65 years and older (Table 41). The frequencies and IRs of TEAEs and SAEs in the >65 
years age group were higher compared to the younger age group.

Note: IRs are calculated based on PYE. 
The majority (77%) of patients in the >65 years age group reported more than 1 TEAE, and the SOC 
with the most events reported was the Infections and infestations SOC. Three patients in the >65 
years age group reported SAEs, 1 each with ankle fracture, COVID-19, and ventricular tachycardia. 
There were no deaths reported in any age group in the AA clinical trial programme. The frequencies 
and IRs of events in the Infections and infestations SOC and events of hyperlipidaemia were higher in 
the >65 age group compared to the <65 years age group. 
Renal function 
In the AA clinical programme, only 2 patients with an eGFR between 40 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 at 
baseline were randomly assigned to the baricitinib 4-mg dose, and these patients received the 2-mg 
dose in line with the dose recommendations in the SmPC.

Other intrinsic and extrinsic factors 
No clinically meaningful differential treatment effects were noted for common TEAEs in any of the 
subgroups for gender, race, ethnicity, baseline weight, or baseline BMI. For most TEAEs, the numbers 
were too small for meaningful comparison. No clinically meaningful differential treatment effects were 
found for common TEAEs in any of the geographical region subgroups or for patients with prior versus 
no prior systemic therapy. However, numbers were small. 
Pregnancy 
In the approved RA and AD SmPC, baricitinib is contraindicated during pregnancy. 
The JAK-STAT pathway has been shown to be involved in cell adhesion and cell polarity, which can 
affect early embryonic development. Effects of baricitinib on human foetal development are not 
known; however studies in rats and rabbits have shown teratogenicity. Findings of maternal and 
embryo-foetal toxicities, including skeletal anomalies at doses higher than maximum human exposure, 
indicate that baricitinib may have an adverse effect on bone development in utero. As foetal 
malformation following exposure in utero is an important potential risk, and baricitinib is 
contraindicated during pregnancy in the SmPC, women and men with reproductive potential enrolled in 
the AA clinical programme were required to use a reliable method of birth control during the clinical 
studies and for at least 4 weeks following the last dose of study drug. Pregnancy is a criterion for 
permanent discontinuation from study drug in all baricitinib studies. 
As of 13 February 2021, there were 56 women who became pregnant, and 11 pregnancies were 
reported for partners of male patients while in any baricitinib clinical trial, including trials in RA, AD, 
systemic lupus erythematosus, AA, and psoriasis. 
As of 13 February 2021, 6 women had become pregnant during AA study participation. The outcome 
included: 1 elective termination, 1 spontaneous abortion, 1 missed abortion, and 3 pregnancies still in 
utero. There were no pregnancies in partners of male patients exposed to baricitinib during 
participation in an AA study. No congenital anomalies were reported in the three pregnancies that 
came to an end early; there was a predisposing medical history in the two women who had a 
spontaneous abortion. There were no cases reported of baricitinib use during breast-feeding in AA 
clinical trials. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The known drug-drug interaction (DDI) information and potential effects on other drugs were part of the 
original RA submission and are reflected in the current and proposed labelling for baricitinib. No additional 
DDI studies were completed as part of the AA clinical programme. Baricitinib does not affect cytochrome 
P450 enzymes or CYP3A substrate inhibitors. The only known DDI for baricitinib is with organic anion 
transporter 3 inhibitors with a strong inhibition potential, such as probenecid. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Permanent discontinuation 
By protocol, patients were required to discontinue study drug in case of certain laboratory 
abnormalities, pregnancy, malignancy, HBV DNA detection above limit of quantification, prohibited 
medications, or development of a VTE. 
In the placebo-controlled period, across all 3 treatment groups, fewer than 2.5% of patients 
discontinued study drug because of AEs and fewer than 1% of patients discontinued because of SAEs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/572597/2022  
Page 105/138  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
All AE PTs and all SAE PTs resulting in discontinuation of study drug were single events spread across 
the treatment groups with no cluster of events to indicate a specific safety issue, in both the placebo-
controlled period as well as the extended BARI analysis set. 
Temporary discontinuation 
Criteria for temporary interruption of study drug included the following laboratory findings: abnormal 
blood counts, low eGFR, ALT or AST>5 x UL, haemoglobin<8 g/dl, in line with the warnings and 
recommendations in the SmPC. The occurrence of Herpes zoster, infections (if needed), VTE, suicidal 
related behaviours also led to treatment interruption. 
In the placebo-controlled period, the percentage of patients with ≥1 temporary interruption was similar 
in the baricitinib 2-mg, baricitinib 4-mg, and placebo groups. For most patients, the reason for 
temporary interruptions were AEs, irrespective of the treatment group. Events in the Infections and 
infestations SOC were responsible for most of the temporary interruptions. Herpes zoster and influenza 
were the most frequently reported PTs in baricitinib-treated patients that resulted in a temporary 
interruption of study drug.

Post marketing experience 
Worldwide sales of baricitinib have been collected for the cumulative time period ending on 13 
February 2021. As sales data are only available in complete months, the data are reflective of the 
cumulative time frame ending on 31 January 2021. 
Cumulatively, as of 31 January 2021, there has been an estimated 232,500 patients exposed to 
baricitinib and 138,600 PYE. Approximately 180 patients (0.08%) were exposed to baricitinib 1 mg, 
60,400 patients (26.0%) were exposed to baricitinib 2-mg, and approximately 171,900 patients 
(73.9%) were exposed to baricitinib 4-mg. Since the DLP for this submission, PSUR 08 has been 
completed and submitted to the EMA. 
The MAH concludes that the data available from post-authorisation sources did not reveal any new 
information. Post-approval, spontaneous AE reports remain consistent with the established safety 
profile of baricitinib. 
Of the cases with an opportunistic infection, most were reported in elderly patients, 36.2% occurred 
with concomitant disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, and 32.3% occurred with concomitant 
corticosteroid use. 
Haematologic events were mostly nonserious (84.8%) and included anaemia and white blood cell 
count decreased as the most frequently reported events. Two serious cases of agranulocytosis were 
reported. 
Potential MACE (139 cases) were uncommonly reported (reporting rate 0.06, 0.10 per 100 PYE) with 
49.0% of cases reporting a myocardial infarction/acute myocardial infarction, 28.8% reporting stroke, 
and 22.3% reporting cardiovascular deaths. Most events were in elderly patients having cardiovascular 
comorbidities and risk factors. 
Deep vein thrombosis and PE were uncommonly reported (reporting rate 0.11, 0.19 per 100 PYE). Of 
the 261 VTEs, 51.7% were PE, 36.8% were DVT, and 11.5% reported both PE and DVT. Five cases 
were fatal and were reported in elderly patients with multiple risk factors. Most patients reporting a

VTE had risk factors including age greater than 50 years, history of VTE, lack of mobility, and obesity. 
From the VTE cases reported, about 58% were from patients receiving baricitinib 4-mg and 21% from 
patients receiving baricitinib 2-mg, 21% had no dose reported. 
Gastrointestinal perforations were rarely reported post-approval (reporting rate 0.017%), and most 
reports were large intestine perforation or peritonitis. There were 4 fatal cases (1 small intestinal 
perforation, 1 peritonitis, 1 intestinal perforation, and 1 large intestinal perforation). 
Increases in CPK were uncommonly reported (reporting rate 0.08%) and were generally asymptomatic 
with few details on specific values. In addition, 4 cases (reporting rate 0.0017%) of rhabdomyolysis 
were reported; however, these were not confirmed reports. 
Malignancy was uncommonly reported (reporting rate 0.14%, 0.24 per 100 PYE), with lung neoplasms 
most often reported (14.0% of malignancy cases), a known risk for the RA population (Smitten et al. 
2008). Other frequently reported malignancies included skin neoplasm (10.9%), breast cancer (9.8%), 
and lymphoma (9.2%). Of all malignancy cases, 11% had fatal outcomes, which were mainly related 
to the progression of the malignancy or metastases. 
Hepatic events have been uncommonly reported (reporting rate 0.35%), 89.7% were nonserious, and 
most were related to increases in ALT and AST. There were 4 fatal cases reporting the following 
hepatic events: 1 case of hepatocellular injury and liver metastases, 1 case of hepatic failure and 
hepatic encephalopathy, with a history of HBV and positive antibodies, 1 case of hepatic failure in a 
patient taking baricitinib off label for COVID-19 pneumonia, and 1 case of portal hypertension, with a 
history of alcohol abuse. Among these patients who developed hepatic events, baricitinib-related, 
drug-induced liver injury could neither be confirmed nor appeared to be likely based on the available 
information. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Olumiant is available as 2-mg and 4-mg tablets, and it is currently indicated to treat adult Rheumatoid 
arthritis and adult Atopic dermatitis. For both diseases, the recommended dose of Olumiant is 4-mg 
once daily. A dose of 2-mg once daily is recommended for patients ≥75 years and for patients with a 
history of chronic or recurrent infections. A dose of 2-mg once daily should also be considered for 
patients who have achieved sustained disease control with 4-mg once daily. 
In the current variation, the proposed indication is ‘for the treatment of severe alopecia areata in adult 
patients’. The recommended dose for the treatment of AA is 4-mg once daily, similar as RA and AD. 
During the second round of the procedure, the MAH proposed that ‘a dose of 2-mg once daily may be 
appropriate for some patients such as those aged ≥ 75 years and for patients with a history of chronic 
or recurrent infections’. A dose of 2 mg once daily also is considered for patients who have achieved 
sustained control of disease activity with 4 mg once daily. After 36 weeks of treatment, consideration 
should be given to treatment stop in the absence of response. Confinement of the indication to 
patients with severe AA is relevant for assessing the balance of Risks with Benefits. 
Existing safety profile 
Baricitinib is contra-indicated in pregnancy and in known cases of hypersensitivity to the product. The 
SmPC includes warnings regarding the occurrence of infections, viral reactivation, haematological 
abnormalities, venous thromboembolism, lipids, hepatic transaminase elevations, malignancy, 
hypersensitivity, diverticulitis. The SmPC also includes warnings regarding vaccination, guidance for 
laboratory monitoring (lipids, absolute neutrophil count, absolute lymphocyte count, haemoglobin, 
hepatic transaminases), concomitant treatment with other immunosuppressive drugs. In patients with 
Rheumatoid arthritis and with Atopic dermatitis, the most commonly reported Adverse drug reactions 
Assessment report  
EMA/572597/2022  
Page 108/138  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
were increased LDL cholesterol, upper respiratory tract infections, and headache. Among the ‘common’ 
Adverse drug reactions are viral reactivation (herpes) and pneumonia, while deep venous thrombosis 
and pulmonary embolism were ‘uncommon’. 
For the extension of indication with AA, the MAH did not propose new contra-indications, warnings, or 
new ADRs. Where frequencies were notably different for AA as compared to RA or AD, this was 
annotated as footnotes in the ADR table in section 4.8 of the SmPC. No new important identified risks, 
important potential risks or missing information, were proposed for the RMP. 
As can be derived from the above, baricitinib has a complicated safety profile, with similarities to other 
JAK inhibitors. From the description of demographic and disease characteristics of patients included in 
the trials (JAHO and JAIR) it appears that these are relatively younger patients, as compared to 
patients with RA. 
Design 
This application includes safety data from baricitinib treated adult patients with severe AA from two 
multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (see 2.4. ). Study JAHO is an 
adaptive Phase 2 and Phase 3 study, and study JAIR is a Phase 3 study. At baseline of the phase 3 
studies, patients were randomized in a 2:2:3 ratio to receive placebo, baricitinib 2-mg or 4-mg dose. 
After completing the 36 weeks of the placebo-controlled phase, patients entered a long term extension 
phase of 68 weeks of additional treatment with the allocated baricitinib dose, patients on placebo were 
re-randomised to 2-mg or 4-mg. The safety population is defined as all patients who received at least 
1 dose of study treatment. Safety data are included from the 36-week placebo-controlled periods and 
from the extended period up to database cut off dates of 24 March 2021 for JAIR and 31 March 2021 
for JAHO. 
The overall design with two basically identical pivotal studies is considered adequate to assess the 
short-term (36 weeks) safety of both doses of baricitinib against placebo, and to follow and compare 
the safety experience with the 2-mg and 4-mg dose over time. The 2:2:3 randomisation at baseline 
means that the safety sample of the recommended main dose of 4-mg is the largest sample. . The 
studies are ongoing and will last up to 4 years, but the placebo-controlled phase and the extension 
phase up to week 52 of the studies has been completed and submitted as part of the procedure.   
The posology initially did not indicate whether baricitinib can, or should, be stopped in case of 
sufficient response or lack of response. The pivotal studies do include a randomised withdrawal phase 
at week 52, and completed data up to week 76 were submitted. Dose recommendations regarding that 
baricitinib should be stopped in case of non-response, and that the dose can be reduced if a good 
response has been reached were included in the SmPC at the CHMP’s request (see 2.4.3. ). 
Sample size and follow-up 
As of the data cut-off dates of August 2021, the total database included 610/951 (64%) patients 
treated with baricitinib 4-mg who completed at least 52 weeks of treatment. Following the original 
randomisation in the two pivotal studies, 307/365 (84%) of patients were treated with 2-mg for 52 
weeks, and 479/540 (89%) were treated with 4-mg for 52 weeks.  
Over 80% of patients originally allocated to baricitinib 2-mg or 4-mg in the pivotal studies, completed 
52 weeks of follow-up. During the procedure, the MAH updated the safety data with completed 52-
week results, and discussed differences with the already submitted safety data. The patient numbers 
exposed to at least 52 weeks of treatment with baricitinib 2-mg (n=294) or 4-mg (n=459) are 
expected to be sufficiently large to also detect uncommon adverse events, by roughly relying on the 
‘rule of three’ (Eypasch 1995).

Elderly 
The experience in patients with AA >65 years is limited. The mean (SD) age of the included patients 
was about 37 (13) and only a small portion (2-3%) was ≥65 years of age. This is in line with the 
inclusion criteria of being at least 18 years of age and ≤60 years of age for males and ≤70 years of age 
for females. The reason was to avoid noise due to age-related alopecia, which could add noise in the 
assessment of effect. Consequently, for elderly patients with AA it must have relied on the safety 
experience in elderly patients with RA. Therefore, the CHMP considered that the dose recommendation 
of 2-mg also applies to elderly patients with AA, even if there may be not a large demand for 
treatment of AA in this age group (see 2.4.3. ). 
Generalisation to clinical practice  
The main exclusion criteria (see 2.4.2. ) considered the type of alopecia and inadequate wash-out of 
therapies, and the discontinuation criteria were in line with the warnings and precautions in the 
baricitinib SmPC. Therefore, it is considered that these criteria were not overly selective, which is 
supportive for generalisation to clinical practice. Although it was attempted by the MAH to perform a 
safety analysis by subgroups of the population, the small size of subgroups and the heterogeneous 
nature of AEs limits the interpretation of these data. 
Discontinuations 
The number of permanent treatment discontinuations in the placebo-controlled phases of studies JAHO 
and JAIR was quite low. Between 7% and 11% of patients in baricitinib 2-mg or 4-mg discontinued 
and in 1.1%-2.6% this was due to an AE (usually infections), similar as in placebo. Stopping baricitinib 
in case of infections if considered needed, is recommended in the baricitinib SmPC. Overall this means 
that it is unlikely that the safety experience in AA is distorted by drop-outs, while the low number of 
discontinuations due to an AE suggests good tolerability of baricitinib in people with AA. 
Interactions with co-medication 
The only known DDI for baricitinib is with organic anion transporter 3 inhibitors with a strong inhibition 
potential, such as probenecid.  
Adverse events 
In the 36-week placebo-controlled phase, the occurrence of AEs was lowest in the placebo group and 
numerically higher in the baricitinib 2-mg and 4-mg groups (57% versus 61% versus 63%). SAEs were 
infrequent but occurred less in the placebo group and more frequently in the baricitinib 2-mg and 4-mg 
groups (1.6% versus 2.2% versus 2.6%). As already pointed to above, few patients discontinued 
study drug due to AEs. The occurrence of AEs, severe AEs, SAEs and discontinuations in the extended 
data set, comparing baricitinib 2-mg and 4-mg, is in line with the results of the placebo-controlled 
phase. In the updated safety database, the occurrence of SAEs, TEAEs, severe TEAEs, and 
discontinuations from study drug due to AEs for baricitinib 2-mg and 4-mg in the extended AA dataset 
were basically similar to the initial submission. 
In the placebo-controlled period, the most frequently reported SOCs with TEAEs occurring in 10% of 
patients or more in any treatment group were Infections and infestations, Skin and subcutaneous 
tissue disorders, Investigations, Nervous system disorders, Gastrointestinal disorders, and 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. This is basically in line with what is known from the 
safety of baricitinib in RA and AD. 
Of the most common AEs that occurred in the placebo-controlled phase, upper respiratory tract 
infections, urinary tract infections, headache, nausea, acne, CPK increased, are known as ADRs of 
baricitinib. The occurrence of AEs of folliculitis, fatigue, and vulvovaginal candidiasis was <3%, but 
Assessment report  
EMA/572597/2022  
Page 110/138  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
higher on baricitinib 4-mg, in a dose-dependent way for folliculitis. Folliculitis and vulvovaginal 
candidiasis could be ADRs and are further discussed below. Hypertension and pruritis occurred most 
frequently in the baricitinib 4-mg group, but at a similar frequency in the placebo group and lower in 
the baricitinib 2-mg group. In the extended data set, the occurrence of these AEs remained higher in 
the 4-mg group as compared to the 2-mg group. However, hypertension, fatigue, and pruritis are not 
regarded as probable ADRs because of the low occurrence in baricitinib that was not clearly different 
from placebo and a lower occurrence than placebo in the 2-mg dose group. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Even if SAEs in the clinical trials were low, it numerically appears that the occurrence of SAEs of 
fractures, infections, cardiac disorders, and hepatobiliary disorders was higher for baricitinib than 
placebo. Except for fractures, these are known risks of baricitinib. MACE as an outcome of 
hyperlipidaemia is an important potential risk. Infections are a known ADR, and serious infections are 
an important potential risk of baricitinib. Increases of liver enzymes (ALT ≥3 x ULN and AST ≥3 x ULN) 
are a known ADR, but DILI is not. Therefore, the apparently higher occurrence of fractures was further 
discussed during the procedure. 
Even at low frequency, the more frequent occurrence of fractures in patients treated with baricitinib, as 
compared to placebo, is remarkable. Because nearly all fractures occurred in patients treated with 
baricitinib. At the same time, there was no obvious dose-response relationship, and the fractures did 
not seem to be ‘low impact fractures’. It also must be recognised that the baricitinib 4-mg group was 
larger than the baricitinib 2-mg and placebo groups. Though, according to non-clinical data, baricitinib 
may have an effect on bone. In rat and rabbit reproductive toxicology studies, baricitinib was shown to 
reduce foetal growth/weight and produce skeletal malformations (at exposures of approximately 10 
and 39 times the human exposure, respectively) [Baricitinib SmPC]. It is not clear whether baricitinib 
in doses of 2-mg and 4-mg would lead to relevant bone effects in children or in adults. However, in the 
scientific literature there currently is a wave of publications that suggest that there is an effect of JAK 
Inhibitors (notably tofacitinib and baricitinib) to enhance bone formation and bone mass, to be used 
therapeutically in patients with bone loss due to inflammatory disorders such as Rheumatoid arthritis 
(e.g. Adam et al. 2021 https://www.scientificarchives.com/article/prospects-of-jak-inhibition-in-the-
framework-of-bone-loss). However, the same mechanism might be responsible for increased fracture 
risk (increasing bone mineralization and reducing elastic properties). However, based on the totality of 
data including patients at high risk (RA patients) it is considered that fractures should not be 
considered an ADR of baricitinib based on the available evidence. The main reasons are that: in the RA 
and AD data there were no differences between baricitinib-treated and placebo-treated patients in 
occurrence of fractures; in RA, AD and AA there was no suggestion of a dose-response effect; in RA, 
AD and AA the IR’s at follow-up were similar to the IR’s of the placebo-controlled phase suggesting no 
increment in frequencies; the IR’s for fractures in the RA, AD and AA trials did not seem to exceed the 
background risk.  
Adverse events of special interest 
In the placebo-controlled period, there were no large differences between placebo and baricitinib 
treatment groups for Treatment-Emergent infections, serious infections, temporary interruptions, and 
permanent discontinuations of study drug due to infections. No patients with placebo and 3 patients in 
the baricitinib groups reported serious infections. This is somewhat reassuring, considered that people 
with AA are relatively healthy, as compared with people having auto-immune diseases like RA and AD. 
However, it is considered that also for people with AA and a history of chronic or recurrent infections, a 
dose of 2-mg once daily is more appropriate than the standard dose of 4-mg, which has been included 
in the SmPC at the CHMP’s request.  
Assessment report

Infections that were reported by more than 1% of patients in any baricitinib group and that were more 
frequent with baricitinib compared to placebo were: urinary tract infection, folliculitis, bronchitis, 
herpes zoster, and vulvovaginal candidiasis. Differences were not significant except for vulvovaginal 
candidiasis. Of those infections, urinary tract infection, upper respiratory tract infections and herpes 
zoster are known ADRs of baricitinib. Based on the results of the placebo-controlled trial in AA, 
folliculitis and vulvovaginal candidiasis could be ADRs, which was further discussed by the MAH during 
the procedure at the CHMP’s request. 
In the placebo-controlled phase, there was a higher frequency of folliculitis with baricitinib 2-mg 
(1.4%) and baricitinib 4-mg (2.2%) compared to placebo (0.8%). The scalp was involved in 80% of 
patients, no events were serious or severe, most (70%) of patients recovered or were recovering, and 
no patient interrupted or discontinued study drug due to the AE. Based on the data for RA and AD, 
there is no association of exposure to baricitinib, versus placebo, and folliculitis. This is notably 
different to the AA trial data. The MAH makes likely that there is a mechanical explanation for 
folliculitis due to irritation of the follicle by regrowing hair. In addition, a immunosuppressive cause is 
unlikely, given the results in the RA and AD trials and given that the predominant place of folliculitis in 
AA was the scalp (75%) and was experienced by patients who were responders (71%). Consequently, 
folliculitis in AA is likely due to mechanical irritation by regrowing hair, which is specific for the AA 
indication. While folliculitis in AA can be viewed as condition-specific ADR, it is considered unlikely that 
the occurrence of folliculitis will be a limiting factor for many patients. At the CHMP’s request, 
“folliculitis” was added to the table of adverse reactions in Section 4.8 of the SmPC with a frequency 
“common”. The prescribers and patients are now informed in the SmPC/PIL that folliculitis—like 
eruptions have been reported at the treatment of AA with baricitinib, particularly in the scalp region, 
but that these eruptions are actually a signal of hair re-growth.  
In the placebo-controlled part of the study, vulvovaginal candidiasis occurred more frequently in the 
baricitinib 2-mg, and 4-mg treated groups as compared to placebo (2.6% vs 1.2% vs 0%). In the 
placebo-controlled phase, occurrence on baricitinib 2-mg was lower as compared to 4-mg, but this 
became more similar in the All baricitinib set (IR~2.0 for both dose groups). In most patients these 
infections had occurred <16 weeks after baseline and no additional cases appeared with the data 
update. In contrast, in RA and notably in AD, there was no apparent difference in the occurrence of 
vulvovaginal candidiasis/mycotic infections between baricitinib and placebo and there was no tendency 
that the occurrence of these infections increased over time. It is of relevance for the distribution of risk 
factors that the populations of AD and AA are more similar than the generally older RA population. 
Based on these conflicting results, it is considered that the higher occurrence of these infections in 
females with AA on baricitinib, as compared to placebo, is likely to be explained by chance.  
The changes in blood lipids in the AA trial population are in line with what is known about the product. 
Hypercholesterolaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia are ADRs of baricitinib.  
MACE as an outcome of hyperlipidemia is an important potential risk of baricitinib. In the placebo-
controlled period, there was 1 MACE that occurred in the baricitinib 2-mg group. The 2 other 
cardiovascular events were both serious arrhythmias. Currently, the results do not raise additional 
concerns regarding MACE in the AA population. 
VTE did occur in 2 patients (PE/DVT and PE) in the AA study population, while both patients had 
multiple risk factors for VTE. However, VTE due to treatment with baricitinib is also considered to be a 
risk for patients with AA.  
CPK increases are a known ADR of baricitinib. According to the results in AA, increases in CPK and 
increases >5 x ULN were overall more frequent with baricitinib than with placebo, especially with the 
4-mg dose. Based on the available data in AA, there appears to be no association of muscle symptoms, 
Assessment report

notably of rhabdomyolysis, with elevations in CPK related to baricitinib treatment. Notably, CPK 
increments is a known class effect of JAK-inhibitors, but neither for the other JAK-inhibitor products 
than baricitinib an association was found with rhabdomyolysis. 
Malignancies did infrequently occur in the AA study population and remain an important potential risk 
for baricitinib. 
ALT and AST increases of 3 or more times the ULN are known ADRs of baricitinib, with hepatotoxicity 
being an important potential risk for baricitinib. The current results in the AA population are in line with 
this and do not give rise to additional concerns. 
Other laboratory findings, such as high serum albumin and low monocytes, and vital signs, did not give 
rise to safety concerns. 
Safety in special populations 
The majority of the study population was <65 years of age, data of elderly patients are limited. At the 
CHMP’s request, the SmPC states that clinical experience in patients ≥ 75 years is very limited and in 
these patients a starting dose of 2-mg is appropriate. There appears to be no safety reason to limit the 
upper age to the AA population studied (≤60 years of age for males and ≤70 years of age for females). 
There is no relevant new information for other special populations and situations, including hepatic 
impairment, renal impairment, pregnancy and lactation. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of baricitinib appears as overall positive in the data submitted as part of this 
application. The occurrence of AEs and SAEs was only slightly higher for baricitinib 2-mg and 4-mg as 
compared to placebo. SAEs and discontinuations due to an AE were infrequent. The safety data are 
consistent with the known safety profile of baricitinib for the approved indications, including infections, 
headache, nausea, acne, increased CPK, increased ALT/AST, increased blood lipids. VTE, malignancies, 
and MACE, occurred in single cases. Fractures and vulvovaginal candidiasis were discussed as ADR 
using the updated safety data, but it was agreed that these are not to be considered as new ADRs. 
Folliculitis appears to be an ADR for the treatment of AA only and has been added to the table of 
adverse reactions in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. No other new safety signals were identified in the 
treatment of adult patients with severe AA. However, the safety profile of baricitinib is complicated and 
includes several ADRs concerning laboratory values, most notably of blood lipids, CPK, ALT/AST, of 
which the long-term results are not exactly clear. It is of relevance from the safety perspective 
(malignancy, MACE, VTE, infections, …) to avoid unnecessary long-term exposure in relatively young 
people. During the procedure therefore, proposals for the SmPC regarding when to stop treatment in 
case of non-response and when to reduce the dose in case of good response were included at the 
CHMP’s request, similarly to what was done for RA and AD.  
The CHMP concluded that the safety data for baricitinib was acceptable in the new indication of 
treatment of severe alopecia areata in adult patients.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have 
been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: user 
consultation has been done during the MAA for Olumiant, the extension of indication has not 
significantly altered the structure and design of the PL. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
The proposed indication is: ‘for the treatment of severe alopecia areata in adult patients.’  
Baricitinib is an orally available, reversible, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) competitive Janus kinase 
(JAK) inhibitor. Janus kinases are intracellular enzymes that transmit signals from cytokine or growth 
factor-receptor interactions on the cellular membrane to influence immune cell functions and 
haematopoiesis.  
Insights into the immunopathogenesis of alopecia areata (AA) began with recognising the hair follicle 
as an immune-privileged site like the eye and testes (Paus et al., 2005). Disruption of this immune 
privilege occurs upon follicular influx by auto-reactive CD8+ T cells, leading to increases in major 
histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class I and II antigens and inflammation disrupting hair follicle 
biology (Islam et al. 2015; Strazzulla et al. 2018). Activation of the pathogenic T cells leads to IFNg 
production, which contributes both to enhanced MHC class I and II antigens and interleukin-15 (IL 15) 
(Islam et al. 2015; Strazzulla et al. 2018) accompanied by additional cytokines including IL 2, IL-13, 
IL-23, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (Suárez-Fariñas et al. 2015). All these inflammatory-related 
cytokines are dependent on JAK/STAT signalling, and of note, IFNg utilizes JAK1 and JAK2. 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by patches of nonscarring hair loss. AA is 
associated with atopic diseases such as atopic dermatitis and asthma. Severe AA is defined as scalp 
hair loss> 50%. Severe AA is recognized as a significant autoimmune condition with emotional and 
psychosocial distress, including high prevalence of depression and anxiety. Although up to 50% of 
Assessment report  
EMA/572597/2022  
Page 128/138  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients with patchy alopecia areata experience spontaneous hair regrowth within one year, most will 
relapse months or years after remission. 
Both children and adults may develop alopecia areata, and the disorder occurs at similar rates in males 
and females (Strazzulla LC et al., 2018). AA has a lifetime prevalence of approximately 2% 
(Wasserman et al., 2007; Islam et al., 2015; Korta et al., 2018).  The mean age for diagnosis of AA is 
predicted to be of 32 years in males and 36 years in females (Mirzoyev SA et al. 2013). It has a higher 
psychological and cosmetic burden for women. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
No treatment for AA indication is widely available in the EU through centralized approval. However, 
some authorized medications are available in individual member states (e.g. in NL methylprednisolone 
and triamcinolone intra-lesion injections are approved for AA indication). Current guidelines advise on 
topical (corticosteroids and minoxidil) or systemic therapies (corticosteroids, corticosteroid-sparing 
agents such as cyclosporin and methotrexate, and biological such as ustekinumab/Stelara) (European 
Dermatology Forum (EDF): Evidence-based (S3) guideline for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia 
in women and in men, 2017; British Association of Dermatologists (BAD): Guidelines for the 
management of alopecia areata, 2012). However, some of those treatments are used off-label. The 
response to treatment varies widely; few well-designed clinical trials have evaluated these therapies. 
Therefore, there is an unmet medical need for patients with severe AA. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The baricitinib clinical development programme for AA includes 2 pivotal global clinical studies (Study 
I4V-MC-JAHO [JAHO] and Study I4V-MC-JAIR [JAIR]) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of baricitinib 
in adult patients with severe AA defined as ≥50% scalp hair loss, a duration of the current episode of at 
least 6 months. Both studies were multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-
group, and outpatient. The primary endpoint was a SALT score ≤20 at week 36, which corresponds to a 
scalp hair loss of ≤20% or at least 80% scalp hair coverage. 
Study JAHO was a Phase 2/3, adaptive, and operationally seamless placebo-controlled study. The 
Phase 2 portion was designed to select up to 2 doses of baricitinib (of 1 mg, 2-mg and 4-mg QD) to be 
evaluated in the Phase 3 portion of the study. 
In the Phase 3 portion of JAHO and in Study JAIR, the efficacy and safety of 2-mg/day and 4-mg/day 
of baricitinib were compared to placebo in adult patients with severe AA. The current submission 
includes efficacy data for 855 patients enrolled in the Phase 3 AA studies through Week 36 (placebo-
controlled period), and for 629 patients (approximately 74%) randomised to baricitinib through Week 
52. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Primary outcome (SALT ≤20 at week 36) was met (p<0.001) in both baricitinib treatment groups (both 
4-mg and 2-mg dosing regimens) in both pivotal studies. The treatment effect on SALT≤20 in the 
baricitinib 2-mg group was lower compared to baricitinib 4-mg (16.4% versus 29.9.% and 14.7% 
versus 29.9% in JAHO and JAIR studies, respectively). The treatment effect (difference in proportion 
with placebo) calculated from pooled data analysis was 16% (95%CI: 11% - 21%) and 30% (25% - 
34%) for baricitinib 2-mg and 4-mg, respectively. The results were supported by the results of the 
provided sensitivity analyses. Lowering the extent of hair loss from 50% to less than 20% of scalp hair 
Assessment report  
EMA/572597/2022  
Page 129/138  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in almost one-third of the patients can be considered clinically relevant. The clinical relevance of 
SALT<20% is supported by the development of SALT (Wyrwich et al. 2020a). 
The most relevant key secondary outcomes: (SALT ≤10 at Week 36 (representing almost full recovery), 
patient-assessed Scalp Hair Assessment at week 36, clinician assessed Eyebrow Hair Loss at week 36, 
clinician assessed Eyelash Hair Loss at week 36) demonstrated statistically significant improvements 
for both baricitinib 4-mg and 2-mg. The Scalp Hair Assessment PRO is considered to support clinical 
relevance of the primary endpoint (SALT≤20) because the treatment effects are in line with the patient 
perceptions of the amount of hair loss. The endpoint (0 or 1) in the patient-assessed Scalp Hair 
assessment was also considered relevant by the patient panel in its development (Wyrwich et al. 
2020c). ClinRO EB and EL measure physician assessment on eyebrow and eyelashes hair loss, which 
has an important cosmetic and clinical importance. 
To support clinical relevance, satisfaction with/acceptability of the treatment effect can be indirectly 
assessed through the results on the emotional and functional subscales of the Skindex questionnaire 
and the scores on anxiety and depression of the HADS. In Studies JAHO and JAIR, baricitinib 4-mg 
demonstrated a statistically significant improvement compared to placebo for mean change from 
baseline in Skindex-16 Emotions and Functioning domains at Week 36. This translates into a decreased 
psychological burden in treated patients, and this is considered clinically relevant. Furthermore, 
baricitinib 4-mg demonstrated a statistically significant improvement compared to placebo for mean 
change from baseline in the HADS Anxiety total score at week 36. 
Improvement in SALT started between week 8-16 of treatment and increased until week 52, with 
higher responses in the baricitinib 4-mg groups. Overall from the results of primary, secondary and 
additional endpoints, it appears that the 4-mg dose is superior to 2-mg and to placebo. Most of the 
endpoints also have shown the superiority of the 2-mg dose to placebo.  
Pooled data analysis shows 39% response rates in the 4-mg group after 52 weeks of treatment. 
Thereafter, half of the responders were re-randomized to be down-titrated to 2-mg. SALT ≤20 was 
achieved by 74% (31 of 42) of the patients who were down
titrated to baricitinib 2 mg, and by 96% 
(42 of 44) of the patients who remained on baricitinib 4 mg.  
‑
Subgroup analysis supports the robustness of the higher responses on baricitinib 4-mg. The Pooled 
Week 36 Efficacy Population analysis demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in SALT for 
both baricitinib 4-mg and 2-mg across both AA disease severity and episode duration subpopulations. 
Baldness is psychologically more important for women (they need a denser hair implant for a 
cosmetically acceptable hair than men). Subgroup analysis has been provided in Skindex and HADS 
measures in men and women. Symptom domain of Skindex and depression domain of HADS showed 
more favourable results for female subjects. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
No studies were conducted in European countries. PK analysis from other indications has not shown 
differences between subjects with different ethnicities for baricitinib. Furthermore, efficacy in AA was 
comparable in the subgroup analysis of different regional groups. Therefore, it is not expected that 
efficacy will be different in European countries. 
Both the clinician-assessed SALT score and the patient assessed Scalp Hair Assessment are essentially 
measuring the same measurement concept: the amount of hair (loss). It is acknowledged that the 
amount of hair drives satisfaction and clinical relevance of treatment effects. However, satisfaction 
with the results also depends on the site of remaining hair loss, and satisfaction with the treatment 
Assessment report

results was not directly assessed. However, it could be inferred through the results on Skindex-16 
subscales and HADS subscales.  
Some secondary and additional endpoints were not significant for the baricitinib 2-mg treatment 
group, especially in the JAIR study. For Skindex functioning and symptoms domain, no significant 
difference has been found between baricitinib 2-mg and placebo. For HADS at week 36, no 
subcategories were statistically different from placebo in baricitinib 2-mg group. The CHMP concluded 
that this does not impact the overall efficacy results, as 4 mg is the main dose and there is support for 
efficacy of the 2 mg dose in SALT<20 response. 
Most of the patients (around 90%) in both placebo and treatment arms had prior therapy with 
systemic immunosuppressants/immunomodulator therapy or topical treatments. In total only 23, 33 
and 57 treatment naïve patients are included in placebo, baricitinib 2-mg and baricitinib 4-mg arms in 
pivotal studies, respectively. The proportion of patients using concomitant medication use was small 
and comparable between treatment and placebo arms. Therefore it is not expected that concomitant 
medications use had affected the final results. 
The MAH has proposed a dose of 4-mg for the intended indication, in line with the efficacy results. The 
4-mg dose was more effective than the 2-mg dose, but also, the lower dose can be considered more 
effective than placebo. Initially, no proposals were made for stopping treatment or down titration to 2-
mg in responding patients treated with baricitinib 4-mg, or for when to stop treatment in patients with 
an insufficient response. As the disease may recover spontaneously and given the safety profile of JAK 
inhibitors like baricitinib, the CHMP requested that  guidance should be provided regarding treatment 
continuation and when to stop treatment. At the CHMP’s request, the Section 4.2 of the SmPC has 
been updated  to reflect that a dose of 2 mg once daily may be appropriate for patients such as those 
aged ≥ 75 years and for patients with a history of chronic or recurrent infections. In addition, a dose of 
2 mg once daily may also be considered for patients who have achieved sustained control of disease 
activity with 4 mg once daily and are eligible for dose tapering. 
Because data of the stop and dose reduction sub-studies of the trials became available, the MAH 
provided data driven proposals. After down titration to 2-mg in responding patients, efficacy was 
reduced. In another sub-study, responders were re-randomised to stop or continuation of the 4-mg or 
2-mg dose. According to the results, only 33% and 20% of responders stayed in remission until week 
76 if baricitinib 4mg and 2mg were withdrawn, respectively. This indicates a higher chance of flare if 
treatment is stopped. Therefore, stopping baricitinib in case of maintained good response seems not 
advisable based on the efficacy results of the stop study since a majority of patients lost response 
within 24 weeks after discontinuation. On the other hand, considering the safety profile of baricitinib, 
the exposure should be reduced when possible. At the CHMP’s request, Section 4.2 of the SmPC was 
updated to include the following guidance which was considered acceptable to the CHMP: 
“Once a stable response has been achieved, it is recommended to continue treatment for at least 
several months, in order to avoid relapse. The benefit risk of treatment should be re assessed at 
regular intervals on an individual basis.” 
Predictor analysis has shown that 36 weeks is more appropriate time point to stop treatment in non-
responders compared to 24 weeks. Therefore, Section 4.2 of the SmPC has been updated as follows: 
“Consideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients who show no evidence of 
therapeutic benefit after 36 weeks of treatment.”

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The ‘phase 3’ studies are both ongoing and will last up to 4 years. The data from the placebo-
controlled phase from baseline up to week 36 and the extension phase up to week 52 have been 
completed and were submitted as part of the procedure. Over 80% of patients completed 52 weeks of 
follow-up.  
In the 36-week placebo-controlled phase, the occurrence of AEs was lowest in the placebo group and 
numerically higher in the baricitinib 2-mg and 4-mg groups (57% versus 61% versus 63%). SAEs 
occurred less in the placebo group and more frequently in the baricitinib 2-mg and 4-mg groups (1.6% 
versus 2.2% versus 2.6%). The number of patients who discontinued study drug or study due to AEs, 
varied from 1.6% - 2.2% over treatment groups. In the extended data set, the occurrence of AEs, 
severe AEs, SAEs and discontinuations comparing baricitinib 2-mg and 4-mg, was in line with the 
results of the placebo-controlled phase. No deaths had occurred. 
In the placebo-controlled phase, most common AEs (≥2%) were more frequent in the baricitinib 4-mg 
group, and lest frequent in the placebo group, with some exceptions. Common AEs that were 
numerically more frequent in baricitinib treatment groups included (placebo versus 2-mg versus 4-
mg): upper respiratory tract infections (7.0% vs 6.6% vs 7.6%) and viral upper respiratory tract 
infections (1.6% vs 2.2% vs 1.5%), nasopharyngitis (5.1% vs 4.4% vs 6.9%), headache (5.4% vs 
5.5% vs 6.7%), acne (1.1% vs 5.8% vs 5.6%), blood CPK increased (1.3% vs 0.8% vs 4.3%), urinary 
tract infection (1.6% vs 3.8% vs 3.3%), influenza (1.9% vs 1.6% vs 2.6%), fatigue (1.1% vs 0.8% vs 
2.2%), folliculitis (0.8% vs 1.4 vs 2.2%), nausea (1.6% vs 2.7% vs 2.0%) and vulvovaginal 
candidiasis (0% vs 2.6% vs 1.2%). Of these AEs, upper respiratory tract infections, urinary tract 
infections, headache, nausea, acne, CPK increased, are known ADRs of baricitinib. Serious infections 
are an important potential risk of baricitinib. Increases of liver enzymes (ALT ≥3 x ULN and AST ≥3 x 
ULN) also are a known ADR, but DILI is not. 
Fractures were the most frequently reported SAE for baricitinib-treated patients. In the placebo-
controlled period, there were 3 fractures reported in the placebo group, fractures in 8 patients in the 
baricitinib 2-mg group and in 7 patients in the baricitinib 4-mg group. In the extended data set, 11 
patients on 2-mg (3.0%) and 12 patients on 4-mg (2.2%) of baricitinib reported fractures. It is 
concluded that fractures must not be considered an ADR of baricitinib. The main reasons are that: in 
the RA and AD data there were no differences between baricitinib-treated and placebo-treated patients 
in occurrence of fractures; in RA, AD and AA there was no suggestion of a dose-response effect; in RA, 
AD and AA the IR’s at follow-up were similar to the IR’s of the placebo-controlled phase suggesting no 
increment in frequencies; the IR’s for fractures in the RA, AD and AA trials did not seem to exceed the 
background risk. Further, from a non-clinical part of view, there are no concerns that baricitinib would 
cause fractures in adults. 
There were no large differences between placebo and baricitinib treatment groups for overall 
Treatment-Emergent infections, serious infections, temporary interruptions, and permanent 
discontinuations of study drug due to infections. However, in the placebo-controlled period, there was 
a higher frequency of folliculitis with baricitinib 2-mg (1.4%) and baricitinib 4-mg (2.2%) compared to 
placebo (0.8%); vulvovaginal candidiasis occurred more frequently in the baricitinib 2-mg and 4-mg 
treated groups as compared to placebo (2.6% vs 1.2% vs 0%). While folliculitis in AA can be viewed 
as condition-specific ADR, it is considered unlikely that the occurrence of folliculitis will be a limiting 
factor for many patients. At the CHMP’s request, “folliculitis” was added to the table of adverse 
reactions in Section 4.8 of the SmPC with a frequency “common”. Vulvovaginal candidiasis did not 
appear as potential ADR in RA and AA data. Therefore, it is considered that the higher occurrence of 
vulvovaginal candidiasis in females with AA on baricitinib, as compared to placebo, is likely to be 
explained by chance.

Regarding Hepatobiliary disorders, there was one SAE of acute cholecystitis in the placebo group and 
two in the baricitinib groups, with an additional SAE of acute hepatitis in the extended BARI data set. 
In the SOC for Cardiac disorders, there were 4 SAEs reported: ventricular tachycardia, acute 
myocardial infarction, congestive cardiac failure, aortic valve insufficiency, in the baricitinib groups and 
none in the placebo group. 
There were two SAEs of Venous thrombotic events (Pulmonary embolism or Deep vein thrombosis) in 
the extended/all BARI data sets, which are known ADRs of baricitinib. Both patients had multiple risk 
factors for VTE. 
The number of malignancies (n=3) and NMSC (n=2) in the AA programme was small in patients 
exposed to baricitinib for up to 2.5 years in the All BARI AA analysis set. In the placebo-controlled 
period, one event of prostate cancer occurred with placebo and 1 event of B-cell lymphoma occurred 
with baricitinib 4-mg. 
Regarding laboratory values: haematologic changes (neutrophil count decreased, lymphocyte count 
decreased, haemoglobin level decreased, and platelet count increased) and blood lipid changes 
(hyperlipideamia but no hyper-triglyceridaemia), CPK increased, ALT/AST increased are in line with 
what is known about baricitinib. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
To reduce lengthy exposure, a stop of treatment with baricitinib in case of maintained good response 
could be considered. However, stopping baricitinib in case of maintained good response seems not 
advisable based on the efficacy results of the stop study since a majority of patients lost response 
within 24 weeks after discontinuation. On the other hand, considering the safety profile of baricitinib, 
the exposure should be reduced when possible. At the CHMP’s request, Section 4.2 of the SmPC was 
updated to include the following guidance which was considered acceptable to the CHMP: “Once a 
stable response has been achieved, it is recommended to continue treatment for at least several 
months, in order to avoid relapse. The benefit risk of treatment should be re assessed at regular 
intervals on an individual basis.” 
A review of JAK inhibitors in the treatment of inflammatory disorders has been initiated at the request 
of the European Commission (EC) under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and is currently 
on-going.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Favourable effects 
There are limited treatment options available for the management of severe AA. No centrally approved 
medication is authorized in the EU.  
Baricitinib is the first JAK inhibitor to be considered for an AA indication. The primary outcome (SALT ≤
20 at week 36) was met (p<0.001) in both baricitinib treatment groups (both 4-mg and 2-mg dosing 
regimens). A higher clinically relevant and statistically more robust treatment effect was observed in 
baricitinib 4-mg as compared to baricitinib 2-mg, supported by key secondary endpoints.  
The onset of treatment effect was between 8-24 weeks and continues to improve. 
In the management of AA and hair loss, the acceptability of the amount of hair that grows back is 
clinically relevant. If the amount of hair growth is insufficient, treatment will not be satisfactory for the 
patients. A minimum of 30% of hair growth was needed to meet the primary endpoint in each patient. 
This outcome was considered to be clinically relevant in severe AA by patients and physicians who 
were panellists in the development of SALT. Patient satisfaction with the treatment result was not 
directly assessed in the pivotal trials but is supported to some extent by the changes in emotional and 
functional subscales of Skindex and the anxiety and depression subscales of the HADS.  
Hair loss is generally more important in women (they need a denser hair growth for cosmetically 
acceptable hair than men). In subgroup analysis, the primary endpoint (SALT scores under 20) was 
met for both men and women. Skindex and HADS measures showed comparable results for female 
subjects and in some domains such as depression, better outcomes were observed in women.   
Long-term efficacy has been established as the response rate improves to 39% for 4-mg doses at 
week 52. Predictor analysis shows that 21% of patients are late responders. 74% of the responders in 
4-mg group still showed response after down titration to 2-mg. Given the safety profile of JAK 
inhibitors like baricitinib, guidance about when to stop treatment with baricitinib, in case of non-
response or sustained response, is provided in SmPC.  
Unfavourable effects 
From the description of baseline characteristics of patients with severe AA included in the trials (JAHO 
and JAIR), it appears that these are relatively younger patients than patients with RA. Although the 
occurrence of SAEs was low, these play a major role in the appraisal of Benefit/Risk in this patient 
group. The 52-week safety data for baricitinib 2-mg and 4-mg were updated during the procedure; the 
safety results were in line with the results of the placebo-controlled phase.  
AEs and SAEs were only slightly higher for baricitinib 2-mg and 4-mg compared to placebo; SAEs and 
discontinuations due to an AE were infrequent. Few patients discontinued study drug or study due to 
AEs, suggesting good tolerability of baricitinib in people with AA. The safety data are consistent with 
the known safety profile of baricitinib for the approved indications, including infections, headache, 
nausea, acne, increased CPK, increased ALT/AST, increased blood lipids. VTE did not occur, 
malignancies and MACE occurred in single cases. These data overall are indicative of an acceptable 
safety profile.  
However, the safety profile of baricitinib is complicated and includes several ADRs concerning 
laboratory values, most notably of blood lipids, CPK, ALT/AST, of which the long-term results are not 
exactly clear. It is of relevance from the safety perspective (malignancy, MACE, VTE, infections, …) to 
Assessment report  
EMA/572597/2022

avoid unnecessary long-term exposure in relatively young people. During the procedure therefore, 
proposals for the SmPC regarding when to stop treatment in case of non-response and when to reduce 
the dose in case of good response were included at the CHMP’s request, similar to what was done for 
RA and AD.  
Folliculitis appears to be a condition-specific ADR for AA. As folliculitis usually occurs in areas of 
growing hair, maybe due to mechanical irritation at the follicle-site. At the CHMP’s request, it was 
added to the table of adverse reactions in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The primary endpoint was met in both pivotal studies, which was supported by key secondary 
endpoints. The 4-mg dose was more effective than the 2-mg dose, but also, the lower dose can be 
considered more effective than placebo. Primary and secondary outcomes support the clinical 
relevance of the treatment effect. The long-term efficacy of baricitinib until week 52 data has been 
demonstrated.  
Dosing recommendations for stopping in case of non-response and down-titration in maintaining a 
good response were included in the SmPC at the CHMP’s request. However, a treatment stop in case of 
maintained good response will lead to a loss of response in a considerable portion of patients. 
Therefore, the SmPC recommendation for regular benefit-risk assessment for stopping treatment on an 
individual basis by the treating physician is endorsed.  
The safety profile of baricitinib is overall positive. AEs and SAEs were only slightly higher for baricitinib 
2-mg and 4-mg compared to placebo. SAEs and discontinuations due to an AE were infrequent. The 
safety data are consistent with the known safety profile of baricitinib for the already approved 
indications including infections, headache, nausea, acne, increased CPK, increased ALT/AST, increased 
blood lipids. VTE, malignancies, and MACE occurred in single cases. No new safety signals that impact 
Benefit/Risk were identified in the treatment of adult patients with severe AA. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
EMA’s safety committee, PRAC, has started a review of the safety of Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors used 
to treat several chronic inflammatory disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, ulcerative colitis and atopic dermatitis). Olumiant is part of 
the products reviewed in the on-going referral. The review of JAK inhibitors in the treatment of 
inflammatory disorders has been initiated at the request of the European Commission (EC) under 
Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.  
The recommendation on the present application is without prejudice to the final conclusions of the 
ongoing referral procedure under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 resulting from 
pharmacovigilance data. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Olumiant is positive in the following indication:  
“Alopecia areata: Baricitinib is indicated for the treatment of severe alopecia areata in adult patients 
(see section 5.1).”

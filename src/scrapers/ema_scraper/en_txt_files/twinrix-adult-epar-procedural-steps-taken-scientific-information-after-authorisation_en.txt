recommended including a wording on psychogenic syncope 
to the product information of the MAH injectable vaccines. 
The literature review showed an incidence peak occurred 
around the age of 15 years, with females having more than 
twice the incidence of males. The syncope reports with 
secondary injuries were reported most frequently in 
children and adolescents.  
Given that psychogenic syncope is not a true side effect, it 
was not considered appropriate to include syncope as an 
undesirable effect in section 4.8 of the SmPC. However, as 
such events can result in injury, and may not have 
occurred in the absence of the vaccination, the CHMP 
recommended to add a reference to such events in section 
4.4 ‘Warning and Precaution’ of the SmPC and in the PL.

concentrations < 10 mIU/ml at the long-term blood 
sampling time-point (years 11, 12, 13, 14 or 15) and who 
received an additional dose of Engerix-B, was also 
evaluated. 56 subjects had evaluable tests 15 years after 
the primary vaccination with Twinrix Adult. The anti-HAV 
seropositivity rates were 100% in both studies and the 
anti-HBs seroprotection rates were 89.3% and 92.9%, 
respectively. The data obtained also suggest that in the few 
subjects who respond to primary vaccination but loose 
seroprotection level of hepatitis B antibodies, protection 
could still be conferred through immune memory. The 
SmPC has been revised to reflect this information.

previously submitted within variation II/50.  
Study HAB-163 is a phase IV, open, randomised, 
multicentre study to evaluate the effect of risk factors likely 
to influence immunogenicity of combined hepatitis A and B 
vaccine (Twinrix) according to a 0, 1 and 6 months 
compared to separately administered monovalent hepatitis 
A and B vaccines and to demonstrate non-inferiority of 
Twinrix to the monovalent vaccines, in healthy and non-
healthy adults aged 41 years or older. Study HAB-168 
evaluated the immune response to a challenge dose of 
Twinrix versus monovalent hepatitis A and B vaccines 48 
months in the same population after primary vaccination 
from study HAB-160.  
The SmPC has been updated to add persistence data up to 
48 months. In addition, the data on the immune memory 
response following an additional dose administered at 
approximately 48 months has been included.  
In addition, as requested following the assessment and 
approval of a variation for Fendrix submitted in July 2008 
(procedure EMEA/H/C/550/II/0007), that the wording in 
sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC for Twinrix Adult, 
referring to thiomersal containing formulations was

older was evaluated in an open, randomised, multi-centre 
and multi-country study in which Twinrix Adult was 
compared to separately administered monovalent hepatitis 
A and hepatitis B vaccines. The analysis of anti-HAV 
seropositivity rates up to 24 months after the first vaccine 
dose showed that the anti-HAV antibody response was 
influenced the most by body mass index (BMI), followed by 
age, gender and the vaccine received. Obese subjects (BMI 
> 30 kg/m2) achieved significantly lower anti-HAV 
seropositivity rates compared to subjects with BMI < 30 
kg/m2. Based on these findings, the detrimental effect of 
obesity on the immune response to hepatitis A vaccines has 
been mentioned in the SPC and PL.

data should be interpreted with caution and it is 
recommended that vaccination should be delayed until after 
delivery unless there is an urgent need to protect the

trials and of post-marketing surveillance data, the 
information on adverse events reported with Twinrix has 
been comprehensively updated as appropriate. Among 
these changes, 'hypoaesthesia' (loss of skin sensitivity), 
'lichen planus' (bumps on the skin) or 'muscle weakness' 
have been added to the list of undesirable effects. 
'Syncope' has been removed from the list of adverse events 
since it is attributed to the injection rather than to the 
vaccine itself, but an appropriate warning was added in 
section 4.4 of the SPC. The frequency of some adverse 
events has also been updated. As an example, the 
frequency of 'headache' has changed from 'common' 
(occurring in up to 1 in 10 vaccine doses) to 'very common' 
(occurring in 1 in 10 doses or more). The distinction has 
also been made clearer in the SPC between the adverse 
events reported during clinical trials and those reported 
through post-marketing surveillance. Ten cases of overdose 
have been reported during post-marketing surveillance. 
However the adverse events reported following overdosage 
were similar to those reported with normal vaccine 
administration.

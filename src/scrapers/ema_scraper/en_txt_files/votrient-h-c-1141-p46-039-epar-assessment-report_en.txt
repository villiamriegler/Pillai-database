2.3.1.  Introduction 
Study No. CPZP034B1402 
Title: A multicenter, uncontrolled observational study conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
Votrient Tablets in malignant soft tissue sarcoma patients under post marketing usage in Japan. 
The approval of Votrient (pazopanib) in Japan for “malignant soft tissue sarcoma (STS)” in September 
2012 was granted on the condition that a post-marketing drug use-results survey was to be conducted 
in all patients administered pazopanib on or after the approval date, to further characterize safety and 
efficacy of pazopanib in the actual settings in Japanese patients. B1402 was commenced on 28-Sep-
2012 in response to this requirement and concluded on 30-Sep-2019. A final clinical study report 
(CSR) in Japanese was submitted to the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) on 16-
Jan-2020. 
This survey is a multicenter, central registration-based, uncontrolled observational study conducted 
according to Good Post-marketing Study Practice (GPSP) ordinance and protocol in patients treated 
with drug for the indication of malignant STS. This survey included 639 adult patients (≥ 18 years) and 
10 pediatric patients (< 18 years). An English translation of the final CSR for B1402 submitted to 
PMDA is provided. 
Pazopanib (Votrient) is currently approved in the EU in adults for the firstline treatment of advanced 
RCC and for patients who have received prior cytokine therapy for advanced disease. 
It is also indicated for the treatment of adult patients with selective subtypes of advanced STS who 
have received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease or who have progressed within 12 months 
after (neo) adjuvant therapy. Efficacy and safety has only been established in certain STS histological

tumour subtypes. The recommended dose of pazopanib for the treatment of RCC or STS is 800 mg 
once daily. 
In Japan, Votrient was approved for “malignant soft tissue sarcoma” in September 2012 and launched 
in November 2012. On March 17, 2014, approval was granted for a partial change in approval items, 
for the indication “unresectable or metastatic renal cell carcinoma.” As the number of subjects in 
Japanese clinical studies was extremely limited, this study was started in September 2012 in all 
malignant soft tissue sarcoma patients (observation period: 1 year). It included all patients 
administered Votrient on or after the approval date (including those covered under the program for 
drug supply prior to health insurance reimbursement), and notification dated August 31, 2015 was 
received that the approval conditions for Votrient would be terminated, and as of this notification, the 
approval condition (the all-patient study) was terminated. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study No. CPZP034B1402: A multicenter, uncontrolled observational study conducted to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of Votrient Tablets in malignant soft tissue sarcoma patients under post marketing 
usage in Japan. 
Description 
Methods 
The survey was a multicenter, uncontrolled observational study (use results survey) in malignant STS 
patients administered Votrient, set up to collect data related to safety and efficacy information in the 
actual settings. All patients with malignant STS administered with pazopanib on or after the approval 
date (including those covered under the program for drug supply prior to health insurance 
reimbursement), were registered and enrolled in study B1402. 
Investigators/sub-investigators filled in the survey forms with records of patient nformation about 
safety and efficacy, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) information and 
submitted to sponsor. Efficacy was analysed using the Kaplan-Meier method. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics 
A total of 1970 patients who received Votrient® were screened from 378 sites. Of these 1970 patients, 
1290 patients were not required to be recalled and were not included in the study (and hence the 
details of Votrient use were not collected). Questionnaires from 680 patients were completed from 138 
sites. A total of 31 patients were excluded from the safety analysis set and 649 patients were included.

Of these 649 patients, 10 patients were reported to be under 18 years of age. All these 10 paediatric 
patients had different subtypes STS (synovial sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, ewings tumors / primitive 
neuroectodermal, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, myxofibrosarcoma / 
myxoid malignant fibrous histiocyoma). 
In general for the study: Of 649 patients in the safety analysis set, 280 patients (43.14%) were males 
and 369 patients (56.86%) were females. The age (mean ± standard deviation) at the start of 
administration of Votrient was 55.0 ± 16.86 years with the median of 58.0 years. Approximately two-
thirds of all patients were aged 15 years or more and less than 65 years, 4 patients (0.62%) were 
aged less than 15 years, and 218 patients (33.59%) were the elderly aged 65 years or more. Of the 
649 patients, 382 patients (58.86%) had complications, including 45 patients (6.93%) with a 
complication of hepatic dysfunction, 182 patients (28.04%) with hypertension, 56 patients (8.63%) 
with a complication of cardiac and vascular disorders, and 50 patients (7.70%) with a complication of 
renal impairment.

For the primary site, the lower extremity (including the pelvic girdle), the intra-pelvic cavity, and the 
retroperitoneum accounted for approximately 60%. For the tissue type, leiomyosarcoma accounted for 
approximately 30%; however, other sarcomas were also widely distributed. 
For the performance status (PS) at the start of administration of Votrient, “0” or “1” accounted for 
approximately 80%; however, “2”, “3,” or “4” was also observed in 1.08% to 12.94% of patients. 
For the status of distant metastases at the start of Votrient, distant metastases were “present” in 
81.82% of patients, of which metastases to lung accounted for approximately 70% and metastases to 
bones and liver were also distributed in 2.82% to 26.18% of the patients. The demographic and 
disease characteristics were comparable between the safety and efficacy analysis sets. 
Objective(s) 
To investigate the safety and efficacy of Votrient Tablets in malignant soft tissue sarcoma patients in 
actual use. 
Study design 
This study is a multicenter, uncontrolled observational study (drug use study) conducted in Japan in 
malignant soft tissue sarcoma patients administered Votrient for the purpose to collect the data 
relating to the safety and efficacy of Votrient in the actual patient settings. 
Study population /Sample size 
300 malignant soft tissue tumor patients 
Treatments 
The starting dose was 800 mg in 63.94% of patients with lower doses than 800 mg in approximately 
40% of patients. For the mean daily dose of Votrient, the dose category of 600 mg< to ≤800 mg was 
most frequently used in 52.23% of patients, which shows that Votrient was typically used according to 
the dosage and administration instructions in the package insert. The maximum daily dose was 1000 
mg in 1 patient; however, no adverse event occurred during the administration of 1000 mg. For adult 
dosage, pazopanib is usually administered orally once daily at 800 mg (at least 1 hour before or 2 
hours after a meal). The dose should be decreased as needed depending on the condition of patients. 
No dose recommendation is provided for the use in paediatric patients. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy endpoints were as follows: 
• 
Progression-free survival (PFS)

Statistical Methods 
A statistical plan has been included however for the purpose of this exercise it has not been reviewed 
(10 patients out of 680 patient) 
Results 
Median PFS of pediatric patients (< 18 years of age) was 2.14 months (range 2.04-4.54), which was 
not significantly different from the median PFS (range 3.12 months, range 2.83- 3.25 months) of 
patients over 18 year of age.

Median OS of pediatric patients (< 18 years of age) was 4.14 months, and the median OS of patients 
18 years of age was not reached as of 1 year. This is likely due to the large impact of individual case, 
since there were only 10 cases in patients under 18 years of age.

Safety results 
Adverse reactions that occurred in pediatric patients (aged less than 18 years) are shown in Table 10-
38. 
Votrient was reported to have been administered to 10 patients aged less than 18 years out of 649 
patients in the safety analysis set. The incidences of adverse reactions were 70.00% (7/10 patients) in 
pediatric patients (aged less than 18 years) and 82.16% (525/639 patients) in patients aged 18 years 
or more. 
Adverse reactions reported by pediatric patients (aged less than 18 years) were 2 cases each of 
diarrhoea, hair colour changes, and pneumothorax, and 1 case each of nausea, vomiting, 
hypothyroidism, skin disorder, and pancreatitis acute. Of these adverse reactions, pancreatitis acute 
and vomiting were Grade 3, pancreatitis acute was improved in 8 days and vomiting was not 
improved. All of the adverse reactions reported by pediatric patients (aged less than 18 years) also 
occurred in patients aged 18 years or more, and there were no adverse reactions that occurred only in 
pediatric patients (aged less than 18 years). 
There was no notable tendency for the type, seriousness, and outcome of adverse reactions.

Serious adverse events 
Four serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 2 patients. 
Patient ID 7 (16-year-old boy) was reported with diarrhoea, pancreatitis acute and peritonitis. 
Diarrhoea improved in 40 days and pancreatitis acute improved in eight days. However, the patient did 
not recover from peritonitis and physician’s judgement on causality was not reported. 
Patient ID 9 (9-year-old girl) was reported with pericardial effusion that was considered life-
threatening. The outcome of the event was reported as improved in 18 days. Causality assessment 
from investigator was not reported 
Two deaths occurred (a 17-year-old boy and a 16 year old girl), and were assessed by the investigator 
as due to the deterioration of the primary disease. No deaths due to adverse reactions were reported 
in paediatric patients. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The MAH has provided Study No. CPZP034B1402: A multicenter, uncontrolled observational study 
conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Votrient Tablets in malignant soft tissue sarcoma 
patients under post marketing usage in Japan. In this study a minority of the included population was 
paediatric patients; 10/649 patients.  
The study was an uncontrolled observational study and has not collected the information on patients 
with no exposure to Votrient. Thus, it is difficult to demonstrate benefits from exposure to Votrient. No 
new safety events were detected in the pediatric population treated with pazopanib. The safety profile 
observed in this study is consistent with the known and well characterized safety profile of pazopanib.  
For the efficacy in paediatric patients, there were no notable items.  Median PFS of pediatric patients 
(< 18 years of age) was 2.14 months (range 2.04-4.54), which was not significantly different from the 
median PFS (range 3.12 months, range 2.83- 3.25 months) of patients over 18 year of age.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/329579/2020  
Page 10/11 
 
 
 
 
Median OS of pediatric patients (< 18 years of age) was 4.14 months, and the median OS of patients 
18 years of age was not reached as of 1 year. This is likely due to the large impact of individual case, 
since there were only 10 cases in patients under 18 years of age. 
At present the EU approved SmPC provides information in section 4.2, 4.4 and 5.3 that pazopanib 
should not be used in children younger than 2 years of age because of safety concerns with regard to 
organ growth and maturation.  
In section 4.2 it is stated that the safety and efficacy of pazopanib in children aged 2 to 18 years of 
age have not yet been established and no data are available. 
It is also stated that in section 5.1 the obligation to submit the results of studies with Votrient in one or 
more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of rhabdomyosarcoma, non-
rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma and Ewing sarcoma family of tumours has been deferred. 
It is recognised that some very limited data are available from this uncontrolled observational study 
conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Votrient in malignant soft tissue sarcoma patients 
under post marketing usage in Japan. But the extremely limited data from 10 patients is not 
considered appropriate to amend the current text in the EU SmPC 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
ViiV Healthcare UK Limited submitted on 24 May 2016 a group of variations consisting of extensions of the 
marketing authorisation and the following variation: 
Variation(s) requested 
Type 
C.I.6.a 
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new 
II 
therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one 
The MAH applied for the addition of a new pharmaceutical form (20mg/ml oral solution), and 2 new strengths for 
film coated tablets (25 mg, 75 mg). 
In addition, the MAH proposed to extend the indication for Celsentri, in combination with other antiretroviral 
medicinal products for treatment experienced adolescents and children of 2 years of age and older infected with 
only CCR5-tropic HIV-1 detectable (see section 4.2 and 5.1). As a consequence, sections 4.2 and 4.8, 5.1 and 
5.2 of the SmPC are updated to detail posology in paediatric patients and to update the safety, efficacy and 
pharmacokinetic information, respectively. SmPC is also updated regarding existing information on adult 
patients in section 4.5 and the new strengths/pharmaceutical form in sections 6.3 and 6.5. 
Annex II, Package Leaflet and Labelling are updated in accordance. 
Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the latest QRD template version 10. 
The MAH applied for the following indication for new pharmaceutical form (20mg/ml oral solution), and 2 new 
strengths for film coated tablets (25 mg, 75 mg): 
CELSENTRI, in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products, is indicated for treatment experienced 
adults, adolescents and children of 2 years of age and older infected with only CCR5-tropic HIV-1 detectable (see 
section 4.2 and 5.1). 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 7.2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 – Group of variations 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision P/0237/2015 
on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0237/2015 was completed. 
The PDCO issued an opinion on compliance for the PIP P/0237/2015. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the MAH  did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan 
Page 7/44 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the 
proposed indication.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
The Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimated that in 2014 more than 36 million people 
globally were living with HIV/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and that since 2000, 25.3 million 
people have died of AIDS-related illnesses.  Globally, there were 2.6 million children living with HIV at the end 
of 2014, of whom 2.3 million live in sub-Saharan Africa.   
The vast majority of HIV+ children are infected at time of birth (>90%). Although significant progress has been 
made, universal access to treatment to prevent mother to child transmission has not yet been achieved in many 
developing countries and a significant number of perinatal transmissions still occur.  During 2014, 220,000 
children (190,000 in sub-Saharan Africa) were newly infected.  The majority of children with HIV/AIDS living 
outside sub-Saharan Africa are in Asia and the Pacific, with smaller numbers living in the United States of 
America (US), Europe and Latin America. 
Actual access to therapy is lower in children than in adults in the high epidemic regions, and treatment outcomes 
are poor. There is still a gap between the numbers of agents that are available for children as compared to 
adults, in particular for the very young. Of note, antiretroviral treatment are nowadays recommended for all 
HIV-infected children, regardless of clinical symptoms, viral load or CD4 count according to HIV treatment 
guidelines, including that of WHO. 
About the product 
Celsentri (maraviroc) was first approved in the US in August 2007 (accelerated approval, followed by full 
approval in November 2008), and in the EU in September 2007. In addition to the US and EU, maraviroc is 
currently approved in more than 30 other countries. Maraviroc is presently available as 150 mg or 300 mg oral 
tablets. The present EU indication concerns Celsentri in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products 
for the treatment of treatment-experienced adults infected with only CCR5-tropic HIV-1 detectable.  
Maraviroc is a CCR5-inhibitor, and as such blocks the host cell co-receptor CCR5 that is utilized by CCR5-tropic 
viral strains, in addition to the CD4-receptor, in the process of viral entry. Maraviroc is presently the only 
antiretroviral agent that binds to the host and not to the virus.  
Type of Application and aspects on development 
Paediatric post marketing studies were required in the US and EU in association with approval of maraviroc.  The 
scope of the approved Paediatric Investigation Plan in EU (PIP, October 17, 2008 Opinion), was similar to the US 
Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) requirements of the FDA.   
Following interactions with the EMA and FDA, the Sponsor initiated Study A4001031 (main study of the present 
application, concerning children from age of 2-18 years), where recruitment started in 2009. Clinical 
investigation of paediatric subjects <2 years of age was planned to be started following the completion of Study 
A4001031. To enable adequate dosing in the younger ones two new tablet strengths were developed, and also 
an oral solution. The oral solution has, outside study A4001031, also been studied in an oral bioavailability study 
in adults (study A4001034).  
Despite all efforts by the sponsor, the rate of enrolment in Study A4001031 declined to less than 1 subject per 
month by the year 2013 and no subject was enrolled 1Q/2Q 2014.  The decline in recruitment was 
predominantly attributed to advances in availability and effectiveness of HIV treatment options for children and 
Page 9/44 
  
  
 
 
a reduction in mother to child transmissions, since the planning of study 1031 in 2008.  The sponsor’s proposal 
to consequently stop enrolment was addressed in a PIP modification agreed upon after discussions with PDCO 
and the Modelling and Simulation Working Group (Opinion 18 July 2014). PIP Modification 5 was submitted on 
18 June 2015 to request a waiver of the study in subjects ≤2 years (EMEA-000020-PIP01-07-M05; agreed 21 
September 2015). In summary, the application is considered adequate to fulfil the requirements of the PIP in the 
EU.  These plans, including the waiver for the youngest, were also agreed upon by the FDA. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as film coated tablets containing 25 mg or 75 mg maraviroc as active 
substance and as an oral solution containing 20 mg/ml maraviroc as active substance. 
Other ingredients are:  
- For the film coated tablets: 
Tablet core : microcrystalline cellulose,  calcium hydrogen phosphate, anhydrous, sodium starch glycollate, 
magnesium stearate; 
Film-coat: poly vinyl alcohol, titanium dioxide (E171), macrogol 3350, talc, soya lecithin, indigo carmine 
aluminium lake (E132); 
- For the oral solution: anhydrous citric acid, sodium citrate dihydrate, sucralose, sodium benzoate, strawberry 
flavouring, purified water. 
The tablets are available in HDPE bottles with polypropylene child resistant closures and an aluminium 
foil/polyethylene heat induction seal as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
The oral solution is available in HDPE bottles, with a child resistant closure. The pack also includes a 
polyethylene applicator-adapter, and a 10 ml oral applicator comprised of a polypropylene barrel (with ml 
graduations) and a polyethylene plunger as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active  substance 
The active substance is the same as the one used in the currently marketed product with the following two 
exceptions:  a lower specification limit for palladium was implemented. Revised specifications and method 
description and validation were provided. In addition, only one source of active substance is now used.  
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Film coated tablets 25 mg and 75 mg 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Both strengths (25 mg and 75 mg) are oval and biconvex in shape with a blue film-coat, to match the existing 
commercial tablets. The tablets dimensions are provided in the table below: 
Page 10/44 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 1 Dimensions and debossing of the Celsentri tablet strengths 
Celsentri is approved in the EU (EMEA/H/C/000811), and is available as 150 mg and 300 mg immediate release 
film-coated tablets. A 75 mg tablet was developed and data generated on this strength were then presented as 
supporting data. However, the 75 mg tablet was not registered, as this strength was not required for treatment 
of adults. To fulfil the regulatory commitment for paediatric-appropriate maraviroc formulations, two lower 
tablet strengths, i.e., the previously developed 75 mg tablet and a new 25 mg tablet, as well as an oral solution 
(20 mg/ml) are now proposed for registration and commercialisation. The 25 mg and 75 mg film-coated tablets 
are manufactured using the same common blend and film-coating system as the registered for the 150 mg and 
300 mg film-coated tablet. The different tablet strengths will be differentiated by tablet size, weight and 
debossing. 
The physicochemical properties of the active substance relevant for product performance were identified and 
assessed. Maraviroc presents 3 polymorphic forms. The tablets are manufactured using the same solid form  as 
the registered 150 mg and 300 mg tablets. According to the Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS) 
maraviroc is a high solubility, low permeability molecule (BCS Class III). 
The effect of active substance particle size on tablet content uniformity and dissolution was addressed.  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards, 
with the exception of the film-coating material Opadry II blue which is tested according to an in-house 
specification. In addition, the colorant indigo carmine aluminium lake (E132) complies with EC regulation.  The 
CHMP raised a question on the use of this specific colorant in a paediatric preparation. The applicant justified the 
use of the colorant by the need to distinguish this medication from others that are very likely to be being taken 
concomitantly in this patient population, and thus reduce the risk of medication errors and by the fact that the 
colourant amount per tablet is low and significantly less than the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of 5 mg/kg 
recommended by the European Commission. The justification provided was considered acceptable by CHMP. 
There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 
6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The new 25 mg tablet formulation has undergone the same optimisation process as the higher strengths. Minor 
modifications were made to the clinical formulation. Taking into consideration these minor changes, a 
bioequivalence study has not been conducted between the clinical and commercial 25 mg and 75 mg 
formulations. This is further supported by comparative dissolution studies and the bioequivalence study 
conducted with the 300 mg strength during the adult tablet development program.  
The dissolution method used for quality control (QC) during release and stability is the same as the one used for 
the approved strengths and is considered suitable for the 25 mg and 75 mg strengths. 
A risk assessment of the proposed manufacturing process was performed by reviewing the risk assessment 
performed previously for 150 and 300 mg tablets considering process knowledge achieved and also considering 
quality attributes most likely to be impacted by a decrease in tablet weight. From this review, it was determined 
Page 11/44 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that the critical quality attributes and associated critical process parameters for the 25 mg and 75 mg tablets are 
identical to those for the 150 mg and 300 mg tablets. Based on knowledge and experience of manufacturing the 
150 and 300 mg tablets, the existing control strategy will be used also for the new maraviroc 25 mg and 75 mg 
tablet strengths. 
The primary packaging is a high density polyethylene bottle (HDPE) with polypropylene child resistant (CR) 
closure and an aluminium foil/polyethylene heat induction seal. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC 
requirements. Compliance with the International Standard (EN ISO 8317) Child-resistant packaging – 
Requirements and testing procedures for reclosable packages was provided for the closure. The choice of the 
container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the 
product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The process is the same as approved for the 150 mg and 300 mg tablets. The manufacturing process consists of 
nine  main  steps  which  includes  blending,  screening,  dry  granulating,  milling,  compression,  film-coating  and 
packaging steps. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
The manufacturing process was validated for the 25 mg tablets and a validation protocol is provided for the 75 
mg  tablets.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  manufacturing  process  is  capable  of  producing  the  finished 
product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls (tablet core weight and tablet core 
hardness) are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form.   
Product specification  
The  finished  product  specifications  include  the  following  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
appearance,  identity  (HPLC,  UV),  assay  (HPLC),  impurities  (HPLC),  dissolution  (HPLC),  content  uniformity 
(HPLC, Ph.Eur.), microbial limits (Ph. Eur.), colorant identification (colorimetric test, UV).  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the 
ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay testing has been 
presented. 
Batch data are provided for 10 pilot scale batches of the 25mg strength and for 11 pilot scale batches of the 75 
mg strength. All batches comply with the specifications. Batch results confirm the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data were provided for 3 production scale batches of finished product of each strength stored for up to 
60 months (75 mg tablet) or 12 month (25 mg tablet) at 25 ºC / 60% RH and at 30°C/65% RH (75 mg strength) 
or 30°C/75% RH (25 mg strength) according to the ICH guidelines. In addition those batches were stored for up 
to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines. The only difference 
between the 75 mg tablets used in the stability program and the proposed commercial image is the debossing, 
which has no impact on stability. The batches were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. 
A supporting stability program consisting of one batch of 25 mg white tablets (as used in the clinical studies) 
packaged  in  HDPE  bottles  has  been  completed  through  60  months  at  the  long  term  storage  condition  of 
30°C/65%  RH,  at  the  intermediate  storage  condition  of  30°C/75%RH  for  24  months,  and  6  months  at  the 
accelerated storage condition of 40°C/75% RH. The supporting stability batch was manufactured and packaged 
Page 12/44 
  
  
 
 
at a different manufacturing site, with some minor differences (film coat and tablet shape) to the commercial 
product.  These  minor  differences  are  not  expected  to  have  any  impact  on  finished  product  performance  or 
stability.  
The stability samples were evaluated for appearance, assay, degradation products and dissolution. The 75 mg 
stability samples were also assessed for microbiological quality. The analytical methods are the same as those 
used for release. The methods used were validated and are stability indicating. 
No significant changes have been observed in any of the measured parameters. 
In addition, one batch of each strength was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability 
Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. No significant changes were observed in any of the measured 
parameters,  and  it  is  concluded  that the  25  mg  and  75  mg tablets  are  stable to  light  and  no  precautionary 
packaging or labelling is required. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 60 months with no special storage conditions as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
Oral solution, 20mg/ml 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The oral solution is a clear, colourless solution containing 20 mg/ml of active substance. The solution is 
packaged in white, 250 ml high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles containing 230 ml of solution and capped 
with a white, low density polyethylene (LDPE) lined closure lined polypropylene (PP) closure. In addition, the 
oral solution is co-packaged with a press-in bottle adapter, which is incorporated into the finished product 
container at first use, and an oral dosing syringe. The oral syringe is a Class I device with measuring function and 
is CE marked. 
The oral solution has been developed for patients unable to swallow tablets. The formulation concentration was 
selected at 20 mg/ml to provide appropriate dose flexibility in the target population, 2-12 years old. Appropriate 
volumes of maraviroc oral solution can be administered for both the lowest and highest proposed doses in 
acceptable administration volumes. 
The level of sodium benzoate included in the finished product has been optimised to retain antimicrobial 
effectiveness throughout shelf life and intended use whilst minimising patient exposure. The formulation is 
buffered to a pH of 4.0 ± 0.2 which ensures API is fully dissolved and maintains antimicrobial effectiveness over 
the shelf life of the product by maintaining benzoic acid in its non-ionised form. The proposed commercial 
formulation has been designed to mask the bitter taste of maraviroc. Sucralose is a non-nutritional sweetening 
agent that is non-cariogenic, and suitable for prolonged use in a paediatric population. The strawberry flavour 
has been shown to have appropriate taste masking properties. 
All of the excipients used are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards with the exception of the strawberry flavour. It is composed of propylene glycol, artificial flavours and 
acetic acid. It has been confirmed that the flavour does not contain any excipients requiring declaration in the 
labelling. The rationale for choice of the strawberry flavour has been justified in line with the guideline 
Page 13/44 
  
  
 
 
EMA/CHMP/QWP/805880/2012 Rev 2. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in 
paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
During pharmaceutical development three different formulations were developed: one for Phase I, one for Phase 
II and the formulation proposed for commercial use. A detailed account of the development of the formulation 
is presented with clear explanations provided for the adjustments made at each point. A bioequivalence study 
between the Phase II and the proposed commercial formulation was not conducted due to the minor differences 
between the formulations and the high solubility of maraviroc across the physiological pH range, in line with EMA 
guidance CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98.  
During development of the oral solution some particulate matter was observed, on a single occasion, in the 
compounding tank, prior to filtration of the drug product. The particulates were identified. Active substance 
specifications were modified to prevent the issue. 
The primary packaging is a high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle, with a child resistant closure, containing 
230 ml maraviroc 20 mg/ml solution. Compliance with the International Standard (EN ISO 8317) Child-resistant 
packaging – Requirements and testing procedures for reclosable packages was provided for the closure. The 
pack also includes a thermoplastic elastomeric press in bottle adapter, and a 10 ml oral dosing syringe 
comprised of a polypropylene barrel (with ml graduations) and a polyethylene plunger. The material of the 
primary packaging complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. During development the suitability of the 
container closure system and dosing device selected for use with the oral solution was determined in terms of 
choice of materials, moisture permeability, compatibility, safety (of materials of construction) and performance. 
The oral syringe is considered a Class I device with a measuring function. The oral dosing syringe bears the CE 
marking as required by the Medical Device Directive, EC Directive 93/42/EC and its associated amendments. 
The oral dosing syringe bears volume calibration marks that have been demonstrated to be accurate for 
delivering the intended volumes of the maraviroc oral solution in line with Ph.Eur. 2.9.27 criteria. The 
compatibility of maraviroc oral solution with the oral syringe has been demonstrated where solution was 
withdrawn from the bottle and held in the syringe for 24 hours at 30°C. Following storage in contact with the 
syringe for 24 hours, no changes in the appearance, preservative content or potency of the solution were 
observed. In addition, results for impurities met the acceptance criteria of the specification. The choice of the 
container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the 
product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of 3 main steps: compounding,  filtration and packaging. The process is 
considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Adequate justification for holding times of bulk intermediates has been provided.  
Formal validation will be performed post-approval on the first three consecutive commercial batches, prior to 
launching the product. An acceptable validation plan has been provided.  
Product specification  
The finished product specifications described below include the following appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form: appearance, identity (HPLC, UV), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), sodium benzoate content (HPLC), pH, 
microbial Limits (Ph. Eur.).    
Page 14/44 
  
  
 
 
An elemental impurities risk assessment was performed on maraviroc oral solution. The product was analysed 
for individual elemental impurities according to ICH Q3D. The justification not to test elemental impurities in the 
specification is considered acceptable. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the 
ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and preservative 
content has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for five production scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. Supportive batch 
analysis results are provided for batches with previous phase I and phase II formulations. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data were provided for 4 production scale batches of finished product stored under long term conditions 
for up to 18 months at 30 ºC / 35% RH and for up to 6  months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 20% RH. 
Low humidity conditions were selected to support use of semi-permeable HDPE bottles. The batches of medicinal 
product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for 
marketing.  
The batches were analysed for appearance, assay, and degradation products as well as preservative efficacy 
(pH, sodium benzoate assay) and microbiological quality in accordance with the release specification. In addition 
tests for antimicrobial effectiveness and weight loss were studied. 
All data meet the specification limits at all time points, in all storage conditions. 
In-use stability studies have been performed. Samples were analyzed at initial and after 10 months.  
The batches were analyzed for appearance, assay, and degradation products as well as preservative efficacy 
(pH, sodium benzoate assay) and microbiological quality in accordance with the release specification. In addition 
tests for antimicrobial effectiveness were studied. 
There were no significant changes observed in any of the parameters tested and it was concluded that the data 
support a 60 day in-use shelf-life. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug 
Substances  and  Products.  The  samples  were  analysed  for  appearance,  assay,  degradants,  sodium  benzoate 
content and pH. There was little or no change observed in any test attributes tested indicating that the oral 
solution is not sensitive to light. 
One batch was cycled through -20°C for two days and 30°C for two days, three times in upright orientation and 
then tested. The samples were analysed for appearance, assay, degradants, sodium benzoate content and pH.  
There was little or no change observed in any test attributes indicating that the oral solution is stable to freeze 
thaw conditions and no precautionary packaging or labelling is required. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years when stored below 30°C as stated in the 
SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished products has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have 
a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
None. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology 
The pharmacology of maraviroc was thoroughly evaluated during the original approval procedure for Celsentri. 
No new non-clinical pharmacology studies were submitted in support of the present application. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The non-clinical pharmacokinetic aspects of maraviroc were thoroughly evaluated during the original approval 
procedure for Celsentri. No new non-clinical pharmacokinetic studies were submitted in support of the present 
application. 
2.3.2.  Toxicology 
The toxicological profile of maraviroc was investigated during the original procedure for the approval of 
Celsentri. Repeat-dose toxicity studies were conducted in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys. Liver toxicity was 
observed in rats. Additional findings in rats comprised increased TSH and T4, thyroid follicular cell hypertrophy, 
vacuolation of adrenal glands and dilation of the cecum, the former likely a result of liver enzyme induction.  In 
dogs and monkeys, gastrointestinal effects and QTc interval increase were the main findings.  
No new non-clinical toxicology studies have been conducted in support of the present indication. The Applicant 
refers to the original MAA for Celsentri, which is acceptable. In response to a question the Applicant provided a 
discussion regarding organ systems undergoing postnatal growth and development. It is agreed that the results 
of non-clinical toxicology studies in adult animals do not give any cause of concern for developing organ systems 
and thus there is no need for juvenile toxicity studies. 
2.3.3.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An ERA was submitted by the Applicant during the original MAA for Celsentri (in 2006), having been concluded 
in 2008 after two follow-up measures. The Applicant was asked to submit a revised ERA, taking into account the 
subset of the population represented in the present indication. Recent prevalence data demonstrates a worst 
case figure of 1.13% for the adult EU population. This is conservative enough to cover children 0-14 years of 
Page 16/44 
  
  
 
 
age. Furthermore, a paediatric study submitted in this application showed that pharmacokinetics in adults and 
children is similar. Calculations of PEC/PNEC ratios by the Applicant, using market penetration factors of 0.01 or 
1.29 (based on the actual sales for all indications in the EU in 2015) showed that a risk to the environment is 
unlikely.  
2.3.4.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The Applicant has provided satisfactory responses to a question raised over potential safety concerns for the 
paediatric population. The absence of a juvenile toxicity study is considered acceptable. Furthermore, a revised 
ERA has been submitted, taking into account the presently sought indication.  
2.3.5.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
There is no objection to an approval of Celsentri from a non-clinical perspective. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
Both studies (main study A4001031 and oral bioavailability study A4001034) were performed in accordance 
with Good Clinical Practice as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried 
out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
In support of this application, data are provided from a single uncontrolled study conducted in paediatric 
patients, study A4001031, for which safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics were evaluated. In addition, the 
absorption characteristics of the new formulations were evaluated in adult healthy volunteers in study 
A4001034. Further, a population pharmacokinetic analysis was carried out using the paediatric PK data from 
study A4001031 pooled with adult PK data obtained in patients and healthy volunteers. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
As the main interest of paediatric studies is to verify that a similar drug exposure as compared to that seen 
in adults is achieved, the pharmacokinetic data are considered crucial in this application for a paediatric 
indication for maraviroc. The pharmacokinetic package consisted of a relative bioavailability and effect of food 
study (A4001034) and an efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic study in HIV-1 infected children 2 to < 18 years 
of age (A4001031). 
Bioanalysis 
The bioanalytical method used for determination of maraviroc in studies A4001031 and A4001034 was well 
validated and showed acceptable in-study validation. 
Page 17/44 
  
  
 
 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis 
The population pharmacokinetic analysis (PMAR-EQDD-A400b-DP4-195) included data for maraviroc 
with selected potent CYP3A inhibitors (with or without potent CYP3A inducers) and included paediatric data from 
study A4001031 (intensive and sparse sampling) with adult healthy volunteer data from five drug interaction 
studies (intensive sampling) combined with adult HIV-1 infected subjects’ PK data from Phase 2b/3/4 studies 
(sparse sampling). The adult studies included were A4001013, A4001021, A4001025, A4001026, A4001027, 
A4001028, A4001029, A4001031, A4001041 and A4001052. 
Among the objectives were “To develop an empirical population PK model for MVC with adult and paediatric 
concentration- time data (restricted to patients receiving concomitant treatment with potent CYP3A inhibitors) 
that adequately describes the data and allows comparison of PK in paediatric and adult subjects.” 
The analysis was carried out according to common practice using non-linear effects modeling in the NONMEM 
software. A base model was developed followed by covariate selection. The model with covariates included was 
further refined and the final model evaluated in a qualification step. 
Covariate modeling was performed in NONMEM using forward inclusion/backward deletion. No significant effect 
on relative bioavailability was found for: food, formulation, age or sex. 
The final covariate model was further evaluated by running diagnostic, sensitivity testing for previously fixed 
parameters, simplification tests and VPCs in the development of a final model. A two-compartment, first order 
absorption model with allometric scaling of disposition parameters (clearance and volume scaled by weight to 
the power of 0.75 and 1, respectively) was selected as the final model. The parameter estimates of the final 
model are shown in the table below. The point estimates and standard error (%) associated with model 
parameter estimates were assessed by the bootstrap technique. The estimates were found to be adequate.

Study A4001034 
The pharmacokinetic bridge between the commercial adult formulation of Celsentri and the paediatric 
formulations is dependent of a number of steps. 
Firstly, the applicant has shown that the commercial approved adult 300 mg tablet formulation and the 150 mg 
tablet research formulation is bioequivalent in an earlier assessed study (A4001040). Secondly, given the 
composition and dissolution a strength waiver is considered acceptable between the 150 mg tablet research 
Page 20/44 
  
  
 
 
 
 
formulation and the 75/25 mg tablet formulations. Lastly, even though no absolute bioavailability was shown 
between the paediatric oral solution and 75 mg tablet the formulations are considered comparable.  
The effect of food observed for the maraviroc oral solution was much more pronounced (a 73% decrease after 
a high fat meal as compared to the food effect observed for the commercially available 300 mg tablet (a 33% 
decrease after a high fat meal). However, the similar PK profiles and similar doses per m2 for the paediatric oral 
solution and tablets in study A4001031 indicate that that no large exposure differences were evident between 
the oral solution and tablets in a clinical setting. Therefore, even though this food effect is substantial in adult 
healthy subjects it does not seem to affect the PK to a large extent in children with HIV in study A4001031 and 
thus Celsentri can be dosed irrespective of food also for paediatric patients. 
Study A4001031 
Rich and sparse pharmacokinetic sampling was included during the pivotal study A4001031 in HIV-1 infected 
children 2 to < 18 years of age. It was fairly complex and included dose adaptation based on concentration 
measurements and sparse sampling on different occasions. Stage 1 was the dose finding intensive PK portion of 
the study where each subject’s individual dose was adjusted over the course of a few weeks according to target 
criteria based on PK measurements (Cavg ≥100 ng/mL). Stage 2 was the 48-week safety and efficacy portion of 
the study with subjects participating in Stage 1 could continue into Stage 2 once target PK was achieved and an 
additional minimum of 58 subjects were enrolled directly in Stage 2. Rich PK sampling was obtained at week 2 
and 2 weeks following dose adjustment in stage 1 and at the 48 week visit in all Stage 1 subjects rolled over into 
Stage 2. Sparse sampling was obtained from all subjects at all treatment visits up to and including Week 48 in 
stage 2.  
Treatment and dosing strategy 
The initial doses of maraviroc used in A4001031 were scaled from adult doses to paediatric body size based on 
BSA bands and adjusted for OBT and/or concomitant medications category. Initial paediatric doses were 
therefore approximately 173 mg/m2 in the absence of potent CYP3A inhibitors or potent CYP3A inducers 
(neutral agents), 87 mg/m2 in the presence of potent CYP3A inhibitors, and 347 mg/m2 in the presence of 
potent CYP3A inducers (in the absence of potent CYP3A inhibitors). 
For the intensive PK evaluations of maraviroc, the primary PK parameter was Cavg. Cavg was calculated as area 
under the curve from time 0 to 12 hours (AUC0-12)/12.  
The following dose adjustments were applied: 
• 
• 
If Cavg <75 ng/mL the dose was doubled, not to exceed a unit dose maximum of 600 mg. 
If Cavg >75 ng/mL and <100 ng/mL the dose was increased by 50%, not to exceed a unit dose 
maximum of 600 mg. 
•  No upper limit of concentration (or Cavg) had been identified. Consideration could be given to reducing 
the dose if Cavg ≥300 ng/mL. Such cases were to be discussed on an individual basis taking into 
consideration both safety and efficacy parameters in relation to the PK profile of the subject. 
The first 6 subjects enrolled in each cohort of Stage 2 (who did not also participate in Stage 1) had their first 3 
PK samples analyzed in real time, to confirm dosing selection. The dose selection was provisionally confirmed if 
the median of maraviroc Cavg fell within the range 50 ng/mL to 200 ng/mL, provided that there were no values 
below the limit of quantification (BLQ). 
Page 21/44 
  
  
 
 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis was used to integrate all the data (sparse and rich) from both stages of the 
study into a model to explore relation between drug disposition and body weight and the extent and sources of 
variability in exposure. Further, it was used to explore other dosing regimens and evaluate the change from BSA 
based to body weight based dosing. 
Maraviroc clearance was found to be related to body weight which supports body weight based dosing. However, 
further model qualification is required to draw final conclusions. A high inter- and intra-individual variability was 
estimated for absorption parameters leading to variable exposure. 
Results 
In total, 285 subjects were screened for the study and 103 subjects received at least one dose of study drug 
(maraviroc). The disposition of study subjects is shown in the tables below.

Stage 1 PK results 
Of the 56 subjects enrolled and treated in Stage 1, 49 subjects reached the exposure target (Cavg ≥100 ng/mL) 
on their initial or adjusted MVC dose at Week 2 and were subsequently rolled over into Stage 2. 
Stage 2 PK results 
MVC concentration versus time after dose data, for HIV-1 infected subjects taking MVC in combination with 
neutral concomitant medication (non-interacting ARVs e.g. NRTIs, raltegravir and tipranavir/ritonavir (TPV/r) 
are shown below. The sparse data obtained in children during stage 2 is shown below in green, however overlaid 
with the data from adult studies that were included in the analysis set.

There is little data (n=3) for subjects taking maraviroc with potent CYP3A inducers.  
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
As stated, population pharmacokinetic analysis was used to integrate all the data into a model to explore relation 
between drug disposition and body weight and the extent and sources of variability in exposure. Further, it was 
used to explore other dosing regimens and evaluate the change from BSA based to body weight based dosing. 
Maraviroc clearance was found to be related to body weight which supports body weight based dosing. A high 
inter- and intra-individual variability was estimated for absorption parameters leading to variable exposure. The 
model is important as support for the posology of Celsentri in children down to 2 years of age.  
Study A4001031 was fairly complex and included dose adaptation based on concentration measurements and 
sparse sampling on different occasions. Stage 1 was the dose finding intensive PK portion of the study while 
Stage 2 was the 48-week safety and efficacy portion of the study. Rich PK profiles as well as sparse PK samples 
were obtained in the paediatric study. It is difficult to get an overview of PK results from sparse samples 
obtained in stage 2 as compared to the rich data. Interpretation of sparse PK data is facilitated by population PK 
analysis and the stage 2 sparse PK data were therefore modelled. Essentially, the proposed model assumes that 
the primary PK parameters are identical regardless of study stage. The difference between sparse and rich PK in 
terms of uncertainty is taken into account in the residual error model. The model may be less capable of 
describing sparse PK data for subjects that entered stage 2 directly. However, the overall conclusions from the 
model are regarded valid. 
The Applicant has provided an overview of how the individual average concentration is anticipated to change 
with a switch from BSA-based to body weight-based dosing and reduction of the number of weight bands from 
5 to 4. Body surface area (BSA) and body weight are both descriptors of body size. The relation between the two 
variables is well defined and translation is possible. This means that the study data and the model can support 
dosing by body weight instead of BSA. 
Page 25/44 
  
  
 
 
 
The modelling identified that drug disposition is influenced by body size and that concomitant administration of 
inhibitors of CYP3A4 has a similar impact on clearance as seen in adult patients. Due to the relative paucity of 
data in children that took maraviroc in absence of interacting drugs the proposed dosing regimen in this group 
is not well supported. Further, the dose levels suggested by the Applicant for children <30 kg in this group seem 
too high considering the dependency of drug disposition on body size. 
It is agreed that children >30 kg taking maraviroc with a “neutral regimen” (no interacting drugs) may use a 
dose of 300 mg twice daily. However, for children with lower body weight a specific dosing recommendation 
should not be made. 
For children taking maraviroc with inhibitors the Population PK model is supportive of the suggested simplified 
dosing regimen. However, children with a body weight just above 40 kg may achieve higher plasma 
concentrations compared to the studied mg/kg dosing regimen (see further discussion in the section about 
Clinical Safety). 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
It can be concluded that the behaviour of the new paediatric tablet formulations and the currently approved 
commercial tablets are similar and the PK bridge is acceptable. 
The proposed posology in children aged 2 years and above and weighing at least 10kg, taking potent CYP3A4 
inhibitors, is justified by observed data in combination with PK modelling and simulation. The use of maraviroc 
in children < 30 kg neither taking potent CYP3A4 inhibitors nor inducers is not recommended due to limited data. 
For the same reason, maraviroc is not recommended for children taking only potent inducers of CYP3A4. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
In line with the CHMP Guidance, no dose response studies were undertaken in children.  
2.5.2.  Main study 
Study A4001031: 
 “An Open-Label, Multicenter, Multiple-Dose Pharmacokinetic (PK), Safety, and Efficacy Trial of Maraviroc in 
Combination with Optimized Background Therapy for the Treatment of Antiretroviral (ARV)-Experienced 
CCR5-Tropic HIV-1 Infected Children 2 to < 18 Years of Age”.  
Date of First Enrolment: 22 Apr 2009; Last Subject Completed (Week 48 analysis): 14 Apr 2015 
Centers: 24 sites across 8 countries: South Africa (n=62), US (n=12), Thailand (n=11), Brazil (n=6), Spain 
(n=6), Portugal (n=4), Italy (n=1), and Puerto Rico (n=1)  
Previously treated children and adolescents with a treatment failure (HIV-1 RNA ≥1000) on their current ARV 
therapy, or on their most recent ARV regimen could enter the study, provided that only CCR5-tropic virus was 
seen at screening. Participants needed to have had experience (or intolerance) of at least two ARV drug classes 
for ≥6 months.  Other inclusion and exclusion criteria were those commonly used.  
The overall screen-failure rate for the study exceeded 60%. To a great extent this was due to the presence of 
dual mixed (DM) or CXCR4 virus in the screening sample (28%) or that the tropism test did not generate a result 
Page 26/44 
  
  
 
 
(15%). Considering all screened patients with successfully obtained tropism test, the proportion of non-R5 virus 
(DM or CXCR4) was around 40%, (30% in the 2- <6 year-olds, 38% in the 6- <12 year-olds and 45% in the 12- 
<18 year-olds).  
The objectives of the study were primarily to determine the PK and safety profile of maraviroc in this study 
population. A target maraviroc Cavg of 100 ng/mL was chosen based on previous data generated in the pivotal 
studies in treatment experienced adults (MOTIVATE 1 + 2).  
Secondary objectives included efficacy endpoints including viral response at weeks 24 and 48, CD4 counts, and 
resistance development in those failing therapy. 
Design  
The study contained 2 stages and 4 different cohorts. In stage 1 intensive maraviroc PK data were obtained for 
dose optimisation at Week 2 of maraviroc + OBT.  Each stage 1 subject was to be enrolled into Stage 2 once it 
was determined that they were receiving appropriate maraviroc doses (maraviroc Cavg≥100 ng/mL). 
Once appropriate doses were determined for a particular cohort in Stage 1, screening began directly into Stage 
2 using the determined dose for that cohort.  Across the 4 cohorts, 56 subjects were enrolled to stage 1 and 
another 47 directly into stage 2. 
Subjects were stratified at Day 1 by age and formulation into one of the following cohorts: 
1.  Cohort 1: ≥2 to <6 years of age, maraviroc oral solution;  
2.  Cohort 2: ≥6 to <12 years of age, maraviroc tablet formulation;  
3.  Cohort 3: ≥6 to <12 years of age, maraviroc oral solution;  
4.  Cohort 4: ≥12 to <18 years of age, maraviroc tablet formulation.   
Maraviroc was administered as 25 mg, 75 mg or 150 mg research tablets in Cohorts 2 and 4, or 20 mg/mL oral 
solution in Cohorts 1 and 3, in combination with other ARVs. 
For details on initial dose adjustments please refer to the pharmacokinetic section.  
Results  
Efficacy and safety over 48 weeks were provided for all subjects.  Additional tables containing data up to 5 years 
for subjects who completed more than 48 weeks of treatment were also provided.

Baseline characteristics 
The route of HIV exposure was stated to be perinatal for 102/103 patients (unknown for one). Resistance 
associated mutations (RAMs; NRTI, NNRTI and PI) found at screening were not presented by cohort. Overall, the 
majority of subjects had NRTI and NNRTI RAMs, but 80% had no major PI RAMs and only 10% had >3 major PI 
RAMs. Since boosted PIs (such as lopinavir/ritonavir as Aluvia with activity to such viruses) were widely 
available during the time of this study, the high viral loads at baseline may indicate that a large proportion of 
subjects were in fact likely OFF therapy when entering the study.

Optimized background treatment (OBT) 
The OBT (started at baseline), consisting of 3 to 5 commercially available ARV agents, was selected by the 
investigator and approved by Pfizer, on the basis of resistance testing and treatment history. The OBTs included 
a boosted PI for the majority of patients (around 90/103). In the vast majority of cases as Kaletra (all cohorts), 
followed by a few patients receiving darunavir/r and atazanavir/r and with single exceptions given 
fosamprenavir and tipranavir/r. In the cases where the OBT did not include a PI/r, the backbone consisted of 
raltegravir or an NNRTI. 
Rescue therapy 
If a subject met the criteria for virologic failure or discontinued study drug for another reason (eg, pregnancy, 
AE) and required an alternative regimen, they were followed in study off drug (ISOD). The new regimen, 
selected by the investigator based on the results of resistance testing at the time of failure, had to be recorded 
in the CRF.  
Virological outcome 
The Outcome table below summarizes disposition as well as response (Snap shot algorithm). The table includes 
frequencies of protocol-defined virologic failure (PDVF), defined below. Of note, maraviroc was stopped 
(permanently) in case of PDVF, according to the protocol.

A substantial proportion of subjects stopped therapy prior to week 48, in particular the adolescents. Of the 31 
who stopped maraviroc therapy prior to week 48; 20 remained in the study (ISOD) and 11 left the study. The 
main reason for stopping therapy was “insufficient response” (i.e. PDVF), likely linked to adherence issues. Very 
few stopped for reasons of AEs.

Change in viral tropism, and change in genotypic resistance in RT and PI sequencies 
De novo resistance was, when possible, analyzed for the group that had PDFV (N=23). De novo CXCR4 
tropic-virus was detected in 5/23 (22%) subjects at virologic failure. One additional subject had CCR5 
tropic-virus with reduced susceptibility to maraviroc at virologic failure, although this was not retained at the 
end of treatment.

Emergence of RAMs in the RT or protease sequence was seen in 8 cases. In 5/8 cases this concerned minor PI 
mutations (minor significance for PI activity), and in 3/8 cases emergence of NNRTI mutations (n=2) and 
lamivudine resistance (n=1) was seen. Of the latter 3 cases, a true de novo resistance was only seen in one case 
(NNRTI RAMs); in the other two cases it most likely concerned resistance archived from prior treatment failures.  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The efficacy outcomes of this study are of limited interest for the application. It is quite obvious that the poor 
outcome (around 50% response over 48 week of therapy) is linked to adherence issues. With a proper 
adherence higher response rates may indeed have been expected with the use of the optimized regimens per se.  
The main interest of paediatric studies is to verify that a similar drug exposure is achieved, as compared to that 
seen in adults. Having in mind that maraviroc targets the host and not the virus, it is in a way not self-evident 
that the same PK/PD relation would be seen in the very young as in adults. Or with other words, that the target 
exposure is necessarily the same in children as in adults; an issue not discussed by the MAH. There are some 
publications where the CCR5 expression in children has been compared to that seen in adults (Review by Tobon 
and Aldrovendi 2013; Shalekoff et al 2004). In summary CCR5-expression is lower in the young than in adults, 
and the dose needed to saturate the CCR5-receptors would rather be lower, definitely not higher. From an 
efficacy perspective this is therefore not considered an issue. Therefore, there are reasons to believe that 
maraviroc exposure similar to that seen in adults would yield the same effects in children as in adults. As seen 
in this section, and further discussed in the PK section, the vast majority of children received maraviroc in 
combination with a boosted protease inhibitor (CYP3a inhibitor). Very few were co-treated with a “neutral 
regimen” and next to none received an inducing co-treatment. The data (including modelling and simulation) 
support a dosing schedule across the proposed age and weight span, when maraviroc is taken in combination 
with an inhibitor, but available data can only support dosing from 30 kg and upwards when maraviroc is given 
with a neutral regimen (300 mg bid) and no recommendation for children can be given when maraviroc is given 
in combination with an inducer. In practice, this is in line with the way maraviroc would be used in the EU, also 
in adults. 
Page 30/44 
  
  
 
 
 
 
The proportion of patients with a screening failure due to the presence of dual-mixed or CXCR4 virus was high 
also in these young patients. When looking at all screened patients with a successfully assessed tropism test 
(enhanced Trofile assay), the proportion of non-R5 virus (DM or CXCR4) was around 40%, (30% in the 2- <6 
year-olds, 38% in the 6- <12 year-olds and 45% in the 12- <18 year-olds), that is to say similar figures as 
reported in adults. In addition, the test failed in around 15% of cases. This underscores the need for a 
successfully analysed tropism test prior to the use of maraviroc in all treatment populations, children included, 
in line with what is now stated in the SmPC.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy outcomes observed in study A4001031 were low, evidently for reasons of suboptimal adherence to 
therapy and a high rate of treatment discontinuations/dropouts.  The study included patients who had failed 
prior therapy, a population selected for suboptimal adherence and other problems related to non-virological 
failure. The efficacy contribution of maraviroc in children and adolescents must therefore rely on data obtained 
in adults. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The primary focus of the safety analysis for this application is the safety information through Week 48 in Study 
A4001031. Additional supporting cumulative data through 5 years, using the same cut-off date of 14 April 2015 
as 48 weeks data have also been presented. 
The study is single-armed and of limited size. The focus of the safety assessment is therefore a descriptive 
comparison of safety in children versus safety data generated in adults, mainly with focus on severe AEs and AEs 
of interest. 
Patient exposure 
Up to a cut-off date of 14 April 2015, 74 out of 103 subjects (72%) completed 48 weeks of study and 
64 subjects (62%) the week 96 visit, table below.

The problems of managing HIV therapy in children (and particularly adolescents) with a history of failing 
therapy, is evident. Around half of the patients stopped maraviroc therapy (two thirds of the adolescents), with 
a median follow-up of around 2.5 years. As clarified in the efficacy section, “insufficient response” was most 
likely an effect of low adherence rather than advanced resistance in the vast majority of cases. Of note, numbers 
stopping for reasons of AEs were low. 
Adverse events 
Reported AEs were generally mild to modest, next table.  Grade 3/4 AEs were reported for 6 subjects, none of 
which considered related to maraviroc treatment by the investigator, next table.

Treatment emergent, treatment-related AEs showed the expected pattern, in line with that reported in adult 
patients, next table. SOC terms that would link to the safety concerns of maraviroc were reported infrequently.  
Vomiting was numerically more frequent in the youngest children (cohort 1, receiving maravirioc mixture), but 
not more common in 6-12 years old taking the mixture as compared to those taking the tablet (cohort 3 versus 
2). One child (cohort 3) stopped maraviroc therapy due to vomiting (day 2, grade 2).

Serious adverse event 
Treatment-emergent SAEs (n=15) were reported for 12 (11.7%) subjects up to Week 48, 2 subjects each in 
Cohorts 1, 2, and 3; and 6 subjects in Cohort 4. It mainly concerned infections (oral abcess 1, pneumonia 4, 
influenza 1, pulmonary TB 1). Other SAEs were vomiting (1, resolving without stopping therapy), cellulitis (1), 
prurigo (2), pelvic inflammatory disease (1). None of the events were considered related to maraviroc therapy.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Overall, 2 (1.9%) subjects (1 each in Cohort 3 and 4) permanently discontinued maraviroc due to AEs. One 
subject in cohort 3 stopped maraviroc at day 2 (Grade 2 vomiting, related); 1 subject in cohort 4 at day 29 
(pelvic inflammatory disease, unrelated).  
Adverse events of special interest 
Adverse events of special interest (AESI), identified on the basis of hypothetical concerns, or as a result of 
signals during clinical development program or post-marketing experience concern: hepatotoxicity, malignancy, 
infections, autoimmune diseases, delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions, ischaemic cardiovascular events, 
rhabdomyolysis/muscle toxicity, and postural hypotension. 
• 
The incidence of elevated LFTs from baseline was low and mainly of grade 1-2, in line with results in 
adults. Two cases of grade 3 and 4 ALT/AST, neither considered related to maraviroc therapy (concomitant TB 
therapy in one case, and a negative re-challenge in the other case). Shift tables on transaminases are presented 
in Day80 clinical report.  
• 
Infections were reported in >50% of the subjects, which would be awaited in this setting. Infections 
reported as serious AEs were described in the previous page (not considered related). Although a decreased 
neutrophil count (at any time during treatment) was a common lab abnormality, this mainly concerned grade 1 
reactions (overall around 15%) or grade 2 (around 10%). Shift tables with on-treatment values, presented in 
detail in the day80 clinical report, were not indicate of trends of decreasing neutrophil counts over time, and no 
apparent temporal association between worsening or improvement of the neutropenia with the use or 
discontinuation of MVC (ISOD). The 8 subjects who had a neutropenia of grade 3-4 (2004 DAIDS criteria) had 
other concomitant medications associated with a risk of neutropenia. Of note, benign neutropenia (or rather a 
value below the European normal range) is a well-known finding in people (including children) of African descent 
(issue reviewed by e.g. Thobakgale and Ndung’u, 2014). Lymphocyte counts were without remarks.  
• 
Potential treatment emergent skin or hypersensitivity reactions were seen in 9 subjects (excluding those 
with clearly localized non-serious adverse events).  The time to onset of the events was variable, ranging from 
2 to 169 days, and all but one was grade 1 (the ninth case not serious).  
• 
Postural hypotension was not reported, but on the other hand not searched for (standing BP 
measurements not routinely taken). Three subjects (2.9%), all in Cohort 4, were reported to have nonserious, 
unrelated Grade 1 or 2 TEAEs of dizziness (in one case possibly related to concomitant nausea and diarrhea). In 
summary no signal was seen for problems with postural hypotension (a dose limiting event of maraviroc). No 
cases of autoimmune disease or rhabdomyolysis/muscle toxicity were reported. Through 48 weeks there were 
no malignancies.  There was one case of Hodgkin lymphoma (13-yearl-old female) with onset around 1.5 years 
after stopping maraviroc therapy. Hodgkin´s lymphoma is overrepresented in HIV-infected patients. ).  
In summary no signal was seen for problems with postural hypotension. To simplify dosing, the company 
decided to go from BSA-based dosing (5 bands) used in the clinical study, to weight based dosing (4 bands) in 
Page 35/44 
  
  
 
 
the SmPC recommendation (see pharmacokinetic section). For children weighing 40 kilos and co-treated with a 
boosted regimen (which in practice would be the expected co-treatment) this may, according to modelling, yield 
Cmax values in the range that caused postural hypotension in adult studies exploring higher doses. However, 
the risk for postural hypotension may be smaller in children than in adults, and this side effect (not considered 
a serious side effect) is described in the SmPC.   
Deaths  
There was one death in the study when using the full data set (up to and including 5 years). This 18 year-old 
female had stopped maraviroc therapy after some 4.5 months, but remained in study. She died around 1.4 
years after stopping maraviroc; on the basis of an interview in a severe pneumonia. The event was not 
considered related to maraviroc therapy. 
2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety data obtained in a single armed study of limited size is only descriptive.  The majority of patients 
remained in study up to week 24 (86/103), 14 of whom were in the youngest age group (2-6 years). From week 
24 and onwards large numbers stopped therapy/and or left the study. However, reasons for stopping therapy 
were not attributed to safety problems in the vast majority of cases. In fact, using all data up to and including 
5 years of therapy (median follow-up of around 2.5 years), only 3 patients topped maraviroc for reasons of AEs 
(2 non-related, 1 related non-serious). 
Reported AEs were of a similar pattern as normally reported in HIV studies (in adults as well as in paediatric 
patients). Overall, there is no signal for a different safety profile of maraviroc in children and adolescents as 
compared to in adult patients. 
Laboratory wise, a neutrophil count below the normal range, mostly of grade 1-2, was a common finding. 
However, there were no trends of decreasing neutrophil counts over time, and no apparent temporal association 
between worsening or improvement of the neutropenia with the use or discontinuation of MVC, and lymphocytes 
were without remarks. It is well established that low grade neutropenia is frequent in people of African descent; 
the majority of subjects were recruited in South Africa.  
In the study BSA-based dosing with 5 bands was used. On the basis of modelling, a weight based dosing 
schedule (4 bands) is recommended in the SmPC.  As a consequence, children weighing 40 kg, and taking 
maraviroc in combination with a boosted PI (CYP3A inhibitor), may, according to modelling, yield Cmax values 
in the range that caused postural hypotension in adult studies exploring higher doses. However, the risk for 
postural hypotension may be smaller in children than in adults, and this side effect (not considered a serious side 
effect) is described in the SmPC.   
No concerns on clinical safety are raised. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have been 
included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2. Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The data suggest a comparable safety profile in children, adolescents and adults. No new safety concerns are 
raised.

Considering the data in the safety specification, a slight amendment of missing information based on the new 
data has been proposed, a change to “Long term safety in children and adolescents” instead of “Use in paediatric 
and adolescent population”, which is endorsed. Since dosing of children (by weight and also interactive 
concomitant drugs) is likely particularly prone for medication error, having in mind the substantial interaction 
potential of maraviroc, the company was requested to add  “Potential for medication error (dosing) in children 
due to drug drug interactions” as an important potential risk. That proposal was accepted.

This application concerns a paediatric indication and the proposed amendment for missing information is 
acceptable. 
“Potential for medication error (dosing) in children, due to drug drug interactions” has been added for reasons 
outlined in the previous section. The PRAC does not see a need for additional risk minimization activities for that 
issue (such as studies or education material).  
Overall, the PRAC is of the opinion that the proposed risk minimisation measures remain sufficient to minimise 
the risks of the product in the proposed indication(s). 
Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version V11.1 is acceptable.  
2.8. Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  MAH  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.10. Product information 
2.10.1. User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the basis of a 
bridging report making reference to Celsentri 150 mg and 300 mg film-coated tablets (maraviroc). The bridging 
report submitted by the MAH has been found acceptable. 
3. Benefit-Risk Balance 
Beneficial effects 
Maraviroc has been shown to be effective in adults. Provided similar exposure, by suitable dose regimens, 
maraviroc would be expected to yield a similar contribution to antiretroviral efficacy in children and adolescents. 
Available data indicate that the doses proposed may give reasonably similar exposures as seen in the adult 
population. 
The efficacy outcomes observed in study A4001031 were low, evidently for reasons of suboptimal adherence to 
therapy and a high rate of treatment discontinuations/dropouts. The safety profile was in line with that seen in 
adults, and numbers stopping therapy for reasons of AEs low (around 1%).  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
In line with other paediatric studies on antiretroviral therapy in children and adolescents, study A4001031 was 
a single armed study of limited size, and efficacy as well as safety should be viewed as descriptive. The study 
included patients who had failed prior therapy, a population selected for suboptimal adherence and other 
Page 40/44 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
problems related to non-virological failure. The efficacy contribution of maraviroc in children and adolescents 
must therefore rely on data obtained in adults. 
The current bridging of efficacy and safety from adults is based on pharmacokinetic data from study A4001031. 
Therefore, the quality of pharmacokinetic data and the interpretation of the data through population PK 
modelling is crucial to this application. The applicant’s proposed doses are likely to roughly yield similar 
exposure as in adults. However, the data set in practice concern children who were treated with maraviroc as 
part of a regimen with a boosted protease inhibitor (CYP3A inhibition). A very limited number of children (across 
weight spans) had a “neutral” co-treatment, and very few a net inducing regimen. Consequently, for reasons of 
residual uncertainty about the exposure in the latter groups, dosing recommendations can only be made for 
children weighing >30 kg receiving a neutral co-treatment, and no recommendation can be made for those with 
an inducing co-treatment.  
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
The data suggest a comparable safety profile in children, adolescents and adults. No new safety concerns are 
raised. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The numbers of adolescents and children exposed to maraviroc are limited, and particularly longer term since 
therapy was stopped/subjects left the study to a great extent already after the first 24 weeks of therapy. Since 
maraviroc is a CCR5 inhibitor (i.e. targeting host cell and not the virus), long term safety, in particular issues 
potentially associated with CCR5 inhibition, is closely followed in the adult population since the approval of 
maraviroc in 2007. That safety follow-up is so far re-assuring. 
Maraviroc is a very prone victim of interactions (CYP3A substrate). Dosing in children, by interactive drugs 
typically part of HIV regimens and weight, may therefore be considered more complicated than for most drugs. 
While HIV physicians are used to handle interactions, paediatricians, who would be the main prescribers, may be 
less trained. There may therefore be a risk for medication error (incorrect dosing) and issue was therefore added 
to the list of important potential risks in the RMP, however, without a need for specific safety measures outside 
an optimized SmPC. 
To simplify dosing, the company decided to go from BSA-based dosing (5 bands) used in the clinical study, to 
weight based dosing (4 bands) in the SmPC. For children weighing 40 kilos (around 12 years of age) this will, 
according to modelling, may cause a higher exposure than that seen in adults, according to modelling. For these 
children, the increased Cmax could increase the risk of the dose (Cmax) dependent side effect of maraviroc, 
postural hypotension. However, the risk for postural hypotension may be smaller in children than in adults, and 
this side effect (not considered a serious side effect) is described in the SmPC.  
Importance of benefits and risks 
In EU maraviroc is only approved for use in treatment experienced (presently adult) patients. In practice it is 
mainly considered an add-on drug for usage in patients with advanced background resistance, where it is hard 
to achieve a complete viral suppression, that is to say in patients with a long treatment history including times 
when resistance accumulated due to lack of agents or the use of less optimal regimens available at that time. 
Following the approval of a number of very effective antiretrovirals during recent years (i.e. from the time 
Page 41/44 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
around the maraviroc approval and onwards), the number of such patients is quite limited. When looking at the 
most recent maraviroc PSUR, the total number of adult patients treated with maraviroc in the EU (>1 million 
persons living with HIV) may be estimated to be around 3000 at the most. The number of children with 
HIV-infection in the EU is low, and those failing HIV therapy (virus not suppressed) would seldom have advanced 
resistance, but rather fail as a consequence of low adherence, but with remaining treatment options. The role of 
maraviroc as part HIV treatment in children is therefore projected to be very limited.   
When the study was initiated a 5 year follow-up on safety was decided for. From a regulatory perspective the 
need and relevance of further data is not obvious. Firstly, there are no safety concerns of maraviroc that seem 
to be specific for children, and long terms safety is being followed in larger adult cohorts. Secondly, any findings 
in the present one-armed study of limited size would only be considered as descriptive. Thirdly, the children that 
were recruited to this study are highly selected for non-adherence (including treatment failure and high drop-out 
rates), which further questions the relevance of collecting such data. At the time of this procedure around 20 
children had passed the 5-year time point, and another 38 children were still in study (some of whom no longer 
treated with maraviroc). The MAH was therefore invited to discuss whether the study could in fact be halted. The 
MAH will continue with the original plan, in order to fulfil the obligations with the study informed consents, for 
which study related examinations, tests and treatments were guaranteed for this time span.    
Benefit-risk balance 
Overall, despite the expected very limited use in children, the pharmacokinetic and clinical data may support a 
favourable benefit-risk balance for treatment-experienced children aged 2 years (with a minimum weight of 10 
kilograms) and above.  
Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Celsentri (comprising new tablet strengths of 25 and 75 mg, and an oral solution of 20 mg/ml, 
in addition to existing tablet strengths of 150 and 300 mg) in patients aged from 2 years (minimum weight 10 
kilograms) and above is considered to be favourable. 
4. Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality and safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of, Celsentri is favourable in the following indication: 
“CELSENTRI, in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products, is indicated for treatment-experienced 
adults, adolescents and children of 2 years of age and older and weighing at least 10 kg infected with only 
CCR5-tropic HIV-1 detectable (see sections 4.2 and 5.1)”. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extensions of the marketing authorisation for Celsentri subject to the 
following conditions: 
Page 42/44 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product Characteristics, 
section 4.2). 
Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the 
list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any 
subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the  agreed RMP 
presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being 
received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an important 
(pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan PIP P/0237/2015 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
In addition, CHMP recommends the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation(s) requested 
Type 
C.I.6.a 
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new 
II 
therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one 
To extend the indication for Celsentri, in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for 
treatment-experienced adolescents and children of 2 years of age and older and weighing at least 10 kg infected 
with only CCR5-tropic HIV-1 detectable. As a consequence, sections 4.2 and 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are 
updated to detail posology in paediatric patients and to update the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic 
information, respectively. SmPC is also updated regarding existing information on adult patients in section 4.5 
and the new strengths/pharmaceutical form in sections 6.3 and 6.5. In addition sections 4.6 and 4.7 of the 
Page 43/44 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
SmPC were updated according to relevant guidelines. 
Annex II, Package Leaflet and Labelling are updated in accordance. 
Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the latest QRD template version 10.

1.  Introduction 
On  27  Februry  2019,  the  MAH  submitted  the  final  24-month  clinical  study  report  for  a  paediatric 
polyarticular  juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis  (pJIA)  study  (study  number  IM101301)  for  ORENCIA,  in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended. 
An interim report for study IM101301 was issued in January 2018; that interim report supported the 
application  (procedure  EMEA/H/C/000701/X/0117/G)  for  i)  a  new  subcutaneous  (SC)  route  of 
administration of abatacept for 2-17-year old patients (including thus also a totally new age group of 
2-5-year olds into the SC-indication), as well as ii) positioning Orencia treatment in second line of pJIA 
treatment (i.e. removal of “following treatment failure with TNF-inhibitors” from the IV indication), and 
including  also  monotherapy  in  case  of  MTX  intolerance  or  when  treatment  with  MTX  is  inappropriate 
into the indication. A positive CHMP opinion was issued on 31 January 2019 for this procedure. 
At  the  time  of  the  interim  report,  15  subjects  in  the  2  -  5  year  age  cohort  were  still  ongoing  in  the 
20-month long-term extension (LTE) period of the study, and provision of the current 24-month report 
was requested by CHMP as part of the assessment process of procedure EMEA/H/C/000701/X/0117/G. 
Provision  of  the  complete  2-year  data  is  also  listed  as  an  additional  pharmacovigilance  activity 
(Category 3) in the Risk Management Plan (RMP). In addition, provision of the report is considered by 
the MAH to fulfil the requirement of Art. 46 as it pertains to this study. 
A clinical overview, summarising the results from the full 2-year data of the 2 - 5 and 6 - 17 year age 
cohorts, with a focus on the results from the 2 - 5 years age cohort, was also provided. 
It  should  be  noted  that  the  study  was  extended  for  up  to  5  years  in  some  countries  (Argentina, 
Germany,  Italy,  Belgium,  France,  and  South  Africa)  by  protocol  amendment  to  ensure  continued 
dosing  for  subjects  who  demonstrated  clinical  benefit  from  SC  abatacept  at  the  conclusion  of  the 
study; thus, the study is still partly ongoing. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The  MAH  stated  that  study  number  IM101301,  entitled  “A  phase  3  multi-center,  open-label  study  to 
evaluate  pharmacokinetics,  efficacy,  and  safety  of  abatacept  administered  subcutaneously  (SC)  in 
children  and  adolescents  with  active  polyarticular  Juvenile  Idiopathic  Arthritis  (pJIA)  and  inadequate 
response (IR) to biologic or non-biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD)” is a stand-
alone study. 
The  MAH  stated  that,  in  accordance  with  Article  16(2)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004,  no  further 
impact  on  the  ORENCIA  product  information  related  to  procedure  EMEA/H/C/000701/X/0117/G  (for 
which the Commission Decision was issued on 8 April 2019) was anticipated, as the 24-month results 
remain consistent with the data reviewed during the procedure. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Abatacept  (125  mg/mL  sterile  solution,  ready  for  injection)  was  administered  subcutaneously  by 
prefilled syringe. The same syringe barrel (Hypak Physiolis 1 mL barrel) was used to manufacture the 
three prefilled syringe dosage strengths.

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
As indicated above, an interim report for study IM101301 was issued in January 2018 to support an 
indication  extension  and  new  route  of  administration  (SC)  for  paediatric  use  of  ORENCIA  for 
polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in patients 2 years and above (EMEA/H/C/000701/X/0117/G). 
The interim report presented the complete results for the 2 - 5 year age cohort for the 4-month short-
term (ST) period of the study, whereas a total of 15 subjects in the 2 - 5 year age cohort were still 
ongoing in the 20-month long-term extension (LTE) period at the time of database lock for the interim 
report  (31-Mar-2017).  Complete  2-year  results  for  the  6  -  17  year  age  cohort  for  the  4-month  ST 
period  and  the  24-month  cumulative  period  (4-month  ST  period  plus  20-month  LTE  period)  were 
already presented in the interim report, with the exception of the following: 
•  Growth and Tanner stage analyses 
•  Complete  biomarker  analyses  (thyroid-stimulating  hormone  [TSH],  anti-glutamic  acid 
decarboxylase  [GAD],  anti-thyroperoxidase  [TPO])  including  all  6-month  post  last  treatment 
follow-up  data  for  subjects  who  completed  the  2-year  LTE  or  discontinued  in  the  2-year  LTE 
and who did not continue in the 5-year LTE. 
•  Complete  immunogenicity  and  neutralising  antibody  analyses  including  all  6-month  post  last 
treatment  follow  up  data  for  subjects  who  completed  the  2-year  LTE  or  discontinued  in  the 
2-year LTE and who did not continue in the 5-year LTE. 
•  By-subject listing of adverse events (AEs) in the Study (all AEs from the extended long-term 
beyond year 2 that were not previously reported). 
Within procedure EMEA/H/C/000701/X/0117/G, the CHMP made the following request: “At the time of 
submission  of  the  final  results  (24-month  and  5-year  data)  of  the  Study  IM101301,  the  MAH  should 
address the following safety aspects: MLA eosinophils, MLA (haematuria, RBC and WBC) in urine, the 
effect of MTX on  ADA formation, age dependency of ADA response, AEs occurring within 24 hours in 
the pJIA studies, relatedness of AEs to study drug, immunogenic potential of the lubricant silicon oil.” 
Provision  of  the  complete  2-year  data  was  also  listed  as  a  Category  3  additional  pharmacovigilance 
activity in the RMP. 
The focus of the current assessment was to evaluate safety aspects as identified by the CHMP, as well 
as to assess newly reported data for consistency as compared to the interim report. An exhaustive re-
review of data previously assessed within the completed procedure EMEA/H/C/000701/X/0117/G has 
not been included. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study IM101301 
Description 
Study IM101301 was a Phase 3 multi-centre, open-label study to evaluate pharmacokinetics, efficacy, 
and safety of SC abatacept in children and adolescents with active pJIA and an inadequate response to 
biologic or non-biologic DMARDs.  The  study comprised a 4-month ST period followed by a 20-month 
LTE. 
The study was extended for up to 5 years in Argentina, Germany, Italy,  Belgium, France, and South 
Africa  by  protocol  amendment  to  ensure  continued  dosing  for  subjects  who  demonstrated  clinical

benefit  from  SC  abatacept  at  the  conclusion  of  the  study;  however,  no  efficacy  or  PK  data  is  being 
collected beyond the 20-month LTE. 
According to the MAH, the study focused primarily on paediatric subjects aged 6 - 17 years with active 
pJIA who had an inadequate response to at least 1 biologic or non-biologic DMARD. The purpose of the 
study  was  to  evaluate  if  4  months  of  a  weekly  weight-tiered  SC  abatacept  dosing  regimen  would 
deliver steady-state systemic exposures within the therapeutic range associated with maximal efficacy 
observed  with  intravenous  (IV)  abatacept  in  paediatric  subjects  aged  6  -  17  years  with  active  pJIA 
who  were  resistant  to  at  least  one  biologic  or  non-biologic  DMARD.  The  study  included  2  cohorts  of 
subjects with active pJIA: a 2 - 5 year age cohort and a 6 - 17 year age cohort. 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The overarching objective of the study was to assess pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety in children 
and adolescents ages 2 - 17 years with pJIA following 4 months of ST and 20 months of LT open label 
abatacept SC therapy. 
Study design 
The  study  was  a  non-comparative,  open  label  study,  comprising  a  4-month  ST  period,  followed  by  a 
20-month LTE. See Figure 1 for a graphical depiction. 
Figure 1. IM101301 - Study Design 
Subjects  were  permitted  to  remain  on  background  treatment  with  stable  doses  of  MTX  (permitted 
dose range was 10-30/mg/m2/week with an absolute maximum dose of 40 mg/week), corticosteroids 
and  NSAIDs,  but  other  conventional  synthetic  DMARDs  as  well  as  biological  DMARDs  were  to  be 
terminated with specific wash-out periods before initiation of study medication. 
Subjects were treated with open-label abatacept for a 4-month ST period and evaluated for safety and 
immunogenicity.  Subjects  who  completed  the  ST  period  were  given  the  option  to  enter  a  20-month 
LTE  period  during  which  they  continued  to  receive  weekly  SC  abatacept  injections.  Subjects  who 
entered the LTE period as non-responders per ACR Pediatric 30 criteria were given the opportunity to 
be treated with SC abatacept for an additional 3 months. Treatment was discontinued if an individual 
subject  did  not  achieve  ACR  Pediatric  30  status  after  a  total  of  7  months  of  abatacept  therapy 
(4-month ST period plus 3 months of LTE period). 
The  study  protocol  was  amended  in  some  countries  to  extend  the  study  for  up  to  5  years  to  ensure 
continued dosing for subjects who demonstrated clinical benefit from SC abatacept at the conclusion 
of the study. However, no efficacy or PK data is being collected beyond the 20-month LTE.

Study population /Sample size 
Key inclusion criteria for the study were: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
ages 2 to 17 years, male or female 
diagnosed  with  active  pJIA,  extended  oligoarthritis,  enthesitis-related  arthritis,  systemic 
arthritis (with a polyarticular course), or psoriatic arthritis (PsA), but with no other rheumatic 
disease 
an insufficient therapeutic response (for ≥ 3 months) or prior intolerance to at least 1 biologic 
or non-biologic DMARD 
a history of at least 5 joints with active disease 
active  articular  disease  with  ≥  2  active  joints  and  ≥  2  joints  with  limitation  of  movement  at 
baseline 
Subjects with prior inadequate response to at least one TNFα antagonist or other biologic DMARD were 
restricted  to  no  more  than  30%  of  the  study  population.  Subjects  with  systemic  pJIA  at  onset  were 
restricted to no more than 10% of the study population. 
Key exclusion criteria included: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
previous treatment with CTLA4Ig or abatacept 
failure on more than two TNFα antagonists or other biologic DMARDs 
presence  of  an  active  infection,  serious  infections  or  history  of  frequent  infection  or  chronic 
infections within 3 months prior to the first dose of study medication 
severe concomitant medical comorbodity 
The planned sample size was 160 subjects in the 6 - 17 year age cohort and 30 subjects in the 2 - 5 
year age cohort. 
•  A sample size of 160 subjects aged 6 - 17 years was planned for the primary analysis to allow 
assessment of the PK parameters as well as the safety and efficacy of SC abatacept in pJIA; it 
approximated the sample size of the 4-month open-label lead-in phase of the original IV pJIA 
abatacept study, allowing an evaluation of the PK, safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of SC 
abatacept  in  pJIA  with  similar  precision  as  previously  obtained  for  IV  abatacept  (Period  A  of 
Study IM101033). 
•  A sample size of 30 subjects aged 2 - 5 years was predicted to permit descriptive assessments 
of PK, efficacy, and safety response. 
Treatments 
Open-label SC abatacept was administered by prefilled syringe (PFS) once weekly as a weight-tiered 
dose regimen: 
•  10 to < 25 kg: 50 mg in 0.4 mL PFS 
•  25 to < 50 kg: 87.5 mg in 0.7 mL PFS 
•  ≥ 50 kg: 125 mg in 1.0 mL PFS

Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint of the study was abatacept Cminss at Day 113 in 6 - 17 year old subjects. 
The secondary endpoints were: 
• 
Proportion of subjects achieving ACR Pediatric 30 at Day 113 in 6 - 17 year old subjects. ACR 
Pediatric 30 response was defined as: 
o  ≥  30%  improvement  in  at  least  3  of  the  6  pJIA  core  set  variables  (number  of  active 
joints,  number  of  joints  with  limitation  of  motion,  physician  global  assessment  of 
disease  activity,  parent  global  assessment  of  patient  overall  well-being,  functional 
ability  as  measured  by  the  Children’s  Health  Assessment  Questionnaire  (CHAQ),  and 
CRP) 
and 
o  ≥ 30% worsening in not more than 1 of the remaining 6 pJIA core set variables

by each weight-tiered dosing regimen in 6 - 17 year old subjects. 
•  Safety  summary  (proportion  of  subjects  with  adverse  events,  deaths,  SAEs,  and  AEs  leading 
to  discontinuation)  during  initial  4-month  ST  (6  -  17  year  age  cohort  only)  and  during 
cumulative abatacept period (ST and LTE periods combined) in both age cohorts. 
• 
Proportion  of  subjects  with  positive  immunogenicity  response  during  initial  4  month  (6  -  17 
age  cohort  only)  and  during  the  cumulative  abatacept  period  up  to  6  months  following 
discontinuation of treatment (in both age cohorts). 
Exploratory endpoints (for both age [2 - 5 and 6 - 17] cohorts, unless indicated otherwise) included: 
•  Abatacept Cmin over time 
•  Changes from baseline in individual components of ACR Pediatric 30 over time 
• 
• 
Proportion of subjects achieving ACR Pediatric 30, 50, 70, 90, 100 and inactive disease rates 
over time 
Proportion of subjects achieving ACR Pediatric 30 response rates at Day 113 by weight and by 
TNF  naive  and  TNF-inadequate  response  (IR)  subgroups,  by  JIA  subtypes  and  for  whole 
population after exclusion of systemic JIA patients in the 6 - 17 year old subjects 
•  Assessment  of  anti-GAD  and  anti-TPO  autoantibodies  and  TSH  during  treatment  and  up  to 
6 months following discontinuation of treatment 
•  Characterisation  of  PK  of  SC  abatacept  in  pJIA  using  population  PK  analysis  and  exposure-
response relationship 
•  Assessment of change in growth and Tanner stage 
•  Assessment of improvement in the parent version of the Activity Limitation Questionnaire over 
time 
Statistical Methods 
All  efficacy  analyses  were  descriptive,  and  no  formal  statistical  testing  took  place.  The  various 
response  rates  were  summarised  with  a  point  estimate  and  a  95%  confidence  interval  (CI).  The 
evaluation of drug safety was based on clinical AEs and laboratory abnormalities reported during the 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

study. Growth analysis was based on changes from baseline to Year 2 in in WHO-standardised z-score 
for height and body mass index (BMI). 
CHMP comments: 
Study IM101301 was a part of the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan for ORENCIA. The underlying 
approach,  in  which  limited  data  was  to  be  collected  in  the  target  population  within  study  IM101301, 
and with parallel extrapolation of efficacy and safety data from source populations of other abatacept 
development programmes (abatacept IV and SC in RA, and abatacept IV in pJIA), was agreed on with 
the Paediatric Committee. 
Within  procedure  EMEA/H/C/000701/X/0117/G,  the  CHMP  considered  the  design  of  the  study 
acceptable. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
In total, 173 subjects in the 6 - 17 year age cohort received at least 1 dose of study drug, and efficacy 
and  safety  were  assessed  for  the  all  treated  subjects  population  (173  subjects).  Forty-six  (46) 
subjects were treated in the 2 - 5 year age cohort, and all 46 subjects were evaluated for efficacy and 
safety. 
Baseline data 
In both age cohorts, the majority of treated subjects were white females. In the 2 - 5 year age cohort, 
median  age  was  4.0  years  (range  2  -  5  years)  and  43/46  (93.5%)  of  treated  subjects  weighed 
< 25 kg. In the 6 - 17 year age cohort, median age was 13.0 years (range 6 - 17 years) and 155/173 
(89.6%) of treated subjects weighed ≥ 25 kg. 
Efficacy results 
LTE efficacy in 2 -5 year old subjects 
Compared  to  previously  reported  interim  results  in  the  2  -  5  year  age  cohort,  there  were  no 
substantial  differences  for  the  different  ACR  Paediatric  responder  categories.  Thus  at  Day  729,  the 
proportions  of  ACR  Paediatric  90,  ACR  Paediatric  100,  and  inactive  disease  responders  in  the  as-
observed analysis were 94.6%, 83.8%, and 81.8%, respectively (Figure 2); this compares favourably 
to  rates  of  90.9%  for  ACR  Paediatric  90,  and  77.3%  for  ACR  Paediatric  100  and  inactive  disease 
reported in the interim report.

Results  on  the  JRA/JIA  core  set  variables  of  Active joints,  Joints  with  loss  of motion,  and  Physician’s 
global  assessment  of  disease  severity  remained  essentially  unchanged  from  the  interim  report,  with 
mean % improvements at Day 729 exceeding 95% for these variables. 
Scores  on  the  parental  assessment  of  overall  well-being  and  Children's  Health  Assessment 
Questionnaire (CHAQ) were improved compared to the interim report: in the interim analysis, 24.3% 
and 36.4% mean improvements, respectively, were reported from baseline to Day 729. In the current 
final  24-month  report,  the  corresponding  mean  %  improvements  from  baseline  to  Day  729  were 
47.5% and 53.0%, respectively. 
CHMP comments: 
Compared to the interim data assessed within procedure EMEA/H/C/000701/X/0117/G, there was no 
signal  of  unexpected  loss  of  efficacy  within  the  2  -5  year  age  cohort.  Scores  on  the  parental 
assessment of well-being and on the CHAQ were improved compared to those presented in the interim 
analysis. 
Safety results 
Subject disposition 
In  the  2  -  5  year  age  cohort,  39  (84.8%)  subjects  completed  the  cumulative  period  and  7  (15.2%) 
subjects discontinued (Table 1). 
In  the  6  -  17  year  age  cohort,  132  (76.3%)  subjects  completed  the  cumulative  period,  36  (20.8%) 
subjects discontinued, and 5 (2.9%) subjects completed the ST period without entering the LT period. 
In  both  age  cohorts,  the  most  common  reason  for  discontinuation  was  lack  of  efficacy  (5  subjects 
[10.9%] in the 2 - 5 year age cohort and 17 subjects [9.8%] in the 6 - 17 year age cohort).

Extent of exposure 
For the 46 subjects who entered into the study in the 2 -5 year age cohort, the mean (SD) exposure 
to  SC  abatacept  over  the  cumulative  period  was  22.3  (6.2)  months  with  a  median  duration  of 
24.3 months  (Table  2).  The  subjects  received  a  median  of  102  SC  injections  during  the  cumulative 
period;  16 subjects  (34.8%)  received  all  scheduled  injections  during  the  cumulative  period,  whereas 
11 subjects (23.9%) missed more than 3 injections.

CHMP comments: 
Within  the  2  -  5  year  age  cohort,  the  percentage  of  subjects  completing  the  cumulative  period 
(84.8%)  was  higher  than  the  76.3%  reported  for  the  6  -  17  year  age  cohort.  The  mean  extents  of 
exposures were comparable between the age cohorts (21.8 (SD 6.9) months for the 6 - 17 year age 
cohort, and 22.3 (SD 6.2) months for the 2 - 5 year age cohort). 
Concomitant anti-rheumatic therapies - 2 - 5 year age cohort 
The use of concomitant anti-rheumatic medications is summarised in Table  3. Over 80% of subjects 
were receiving concomitant MTX during participation in the study.  A total of 3 subjects began use of 
excluded  biologic  DMARDs  after  Day  1;  all  3  subjects  began  use  of  excluded  biologic  DMARD  after 
discontinuation from the study drug but within the 56-day post-treatment observation period.

New safety observations - 2 - 5 year age cohort 
Compared  to  data  presented  in  the  interim  analysis,  the  overall  safety  profile  remained  essentially 
unchanged.  A  summary  of  subjects  with  AEs  is  provided  in  Table  4;  compared  to  the  previously 
reported data, 2 additional SAEs (1 drug-related) were reported. The newly reported SAEs were: 
1)  a  limb  abscess  in  one  subject;  this  SAE  occurred  on  Day  674  and  was  assessed  as  severe  in 
intensity and related to study drug. The abscess was surgically excised and the event resolved on Day 
685. Study drug was interrupted from Day 666 until Day 685. 
2) cellulitis in one subject; this SAE occurred on Day 664, was assessed as moderate in intensity and 
unrelated to study drug. The event was reported as having resolved, with a duration of 12 days.

Compared to the interim report, there were no new AEs leading to study drug discontinuation and no 
new  injection  site  reactions.  No  malignancies  or  autoimmune  disorders  were  reported  for  the  2  -  5 
year age cohort during the cumulative period, including no cases of uveitis. 
There  were  4  additional  infections  reported,  bringing  the  total  to  40  subjects.  The  percentage  of 
infections was higher in the 2 - 5 year age cohort (87.0%) than the 6 - 17 year age cohort (68.2%). 
The  most  commonly  reported  infections  in  the  2  -  5  year  age  cohort  were  nasopharyngitis 
(17 subjects,  37.0%),  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (10  subjects,  21.7%),  rhinitis  (8  subjects, 
17.4%),  pharyngitis  (6  subjects,  13.0%),  and  gastroenteritis  (6  subjects,  13.0%).  Most  subjects 
reported  single  occurrences  of  an  infection  or  infestation.  Six  subjects  (13.0%)  reported  2  to 
3 occurrences  of  nasopharyngitis,  and  4 subjects  (8.7%)  reported  at  least  4  occurrences  of 
nasopharyngitis. 
According  to  the  MAH,  a  review  of  the  AEs  against  the  recently  standardised  list  of  ”indicator 
infections”  (opportunistic  infections  and  infections  possibly  indicative  of  immunosuppression)  did  not 
identify opportunistic infections in this cohort. 
Overall, AEs were reported in 95.7% (44/46) of 2 - 5 year old subjects during the cumulative period, 
compared to 93.5% (43/46) in the interim report. The most frequently reported (≥ 10% of subjects) 
AEs were in the SOC Infections and infestations. All reported AEs were mild or moderate in severity, 
except the severe SAE of  limb abscess (summarised above).  AEs with an incidence of  > 10 subjects 
per  100 person-years  were  nasopharyngitis,  pyrexia,  upper  respiratory  tract  infections,  cough,  and 
rhinitis. Table 5 summarises the most frequently reported unique adverse events.

Table 5. Frequently Reported (≥ 10% of Subjects) Adverse Events During the Cumulative 
Period – 2 - 5 Year Age Cohort 
The most frequently observed major laboratory abnormalities (MLA) in the 2 - 5 year age cohort were 
white  blood  cells  (WBC)  in  the  urine  (35.7%),  high  eosinophils  (30.4%)  and  low  serum  glucose 
(21.7%),  followed  by  elevated  creatinine  (15.2%),  elevated  leukocytes  (10.9%)  and  elevated 
potassium  (8.7%).  According  to  the  MAH,  abnormal  laboratory  values  typically  reverted  to  within 
normal  ranges  during  continued  treatment,  and  few  subjects  had  persistent  MLA  for  2  or  more 
consecutive laboratory test days. 
All  subjects  in  the  2  -  5  year  age  cohort  had  negative  anti-GAD  and  anti-TPO  and  normal  TSH  at 
baseline. During the cumulative period post-baseline, 1 positive anti-GAD value was observed on Day 
113 and 1 was observed on Day 477 post-first dose; both subjects returned to negative status at the 
next visit. None of the subjects had a positive post-baseline anti-GAD value on Day 85 and Day 169 
post-last-dose.  Positive  anti-GAD  was  not  associated  with  any  autoimmune  thyroid-related events  or 
autoimmune type I diabetes. None of the subjects had a positive anti-TPO value or an abnormal TSH 
value post-baseline in the 2 - 5 year age cohort. 
In the 2 -5 year age cohort, standardised height and standardised BMI slightly increased from baseline 
during the cumulative 2-year treatment (Figure 3).

Figure 3. Standardised Height and BMI- Mean Change from Baseline During Cumulative 
Period: All Treated Subjects - 2 - 5 Year Age Cohort 
In  the  2  -  5  year  age  cohort,  10.9%  (5/46)  and  37.5%  (3/8)  of  the  subjects  tested  positive  for 
antibodies to abatacept relative to baseline on-treatment and post-last dose, respectively, during the 
cumulative period (Table 6). Titres for all but 1 subject were ≤ 155; the highest titre observed for this 
subject was 1940 at 85 days post last treatment. There was no increase in immunogenicity incidence 
over time. 
Table 6. Proportion of Subjects with Positive Immunogenicity Response Relative to Baseline 
(ECL Method) During Cumulative Period - Immunogenicity Population - 2 - 5 Year Age 
Cohort 
Of  the  5  subjects  testing  positive  while  on-treatment,  2  had  no  missed  doses  within  1  year  prior  to 
positive sample, one subject had 1 missed dose and 2 subjects had 2 consecutive missed doses within 
1 year  prior  to  positive  sample.  During  the  cumulative  on-treatment  period,  2  subjects  had  a 
persistent immunogenicity response (defined as 2 or more consecutive positive test results relative to 
baseline  with  the  same  antibody  reactivity).  There  was  no  apparent  association  between  positive 
antibody  response  and  loss  of  efficacy  or  worsening  safety  results.  In  one  subject,  a  Cmin  value  of 
< 10 μg/mL was reported at days 645 and 729. A positive immunogenicity response was detected at 
the same time points for this subject, but the subject remained an ACR Pediatric 100 responder and in 
inactive disease status at both time points.

New safety observations - 6 - 17 year age cohort 
According to the MAH, the summary of AEs included in the interim report was already complete for the 
2-year data up to Day 56 post-last treatment for the 6 - 17 year age cohort. A listing of AEs reported 
since  the  interim  report,  mostly  comprising  newly  reported  AEs  beyond  year  2,  was  created  for  the 
24 month  report.  According  to  the  MAH,  there  were  no  new  safety  signals.  All  new  or  updated  AEs 
since  the  interim  report  were  mild  or  moderate  in  intensity,  and  in  the  MAH’s  review  of  the  AEs 
beyond year 2, there were no clinically relevant findings. 
There were no changes in the anti-TPO, anti-GAD and TSH results compared to the interim report. In 
total,  6  positive  anti-GAD  or  anti-TPO  antibody  values  were  observed  in  4  subjects  with  negative 
values  at  baseline;  these  were  not  associated  with  any  autoimmune  thyroid-related  events  or type  I 
diabetes. One subject (0.7%) had a shift from normal TSH at baseline to elevated TSH on Day 477. 
None  of  the  subjects  had  a  shift  from  normal  at  baseline  to  elevated  TSH  85  days  or  169  days  post 
last dose. 
In  the  6  -  17  year  age  cohort,  standardised  height  increased  and  standardised  BMI  was  maintained 
during the cumulative 2-year treatment (Figure  4). No inhibition was seen on Tanner developmental 
staging in this age cohort after 2 years cumulative treatment. 
Figure 4. Standardised Height and BMI- Mean Change from Baseline During Cumulative 
Period: All Treated Subjects - 6 - 17 Year Age Cohort 
There  were  no  changes  in  the  immunogenicity  data  in  the  6  -  17  year  age  cohort  compared  to  the 
interim report. Overall, 8/172 subjects (4.7%) developed a positive response relative to baseline; of 
these, 4/172 subjects (2.3%) had a positive response while on treatment, and 6/42 subjects (13.6%) 
had a positive response post treatment. 
Specific safety aspects as identified by CHMP 
1.  MLA eosinophils 
Consistent  with  findings  in  the  interim  report,  a  high  eosinophil  count  remained  a  frequent 
observation, with an elevated count observed in 14/46 subjects (30.4%) in the 2 -5 year age cohort 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/257651/2019  
Page 15/39 
 
 
 
 
(vs.  12/26  (26.1%)  in  the  interim  report).  Similar  to  the  previous  observation,  the  elevated  counts 
were typically self-limiting and transient and were not associated with clinical AEs. 
According  to  the  MAH,  there  was  no  definitive  cause  for  many  of  the  reported  MLAs  for  eosinophils, 
but  a  high  incidence  of  upper  respiratory  infections  was  noted  in  both  age  cohorts  during  the 
cumulative period of the study, especially in the 2 - 5 year age cohort, and viruses such as rhinovirus 
and  respiratory  syncytial  virus  that  are  very  common  in  young  patients  can  be  associated  with 
eosinophilia. No subject with an MLA of eosinophilia had an anaphylactic reaction or an AE related to 
allergies in either age cohort. According to the MAH, seasonal allergies may have played a contributing 
role for the MLA values of eosinophilia in this global trial; 12 (26.1%) of 46 subjects 2 - 5 years of age 
used concomitant respiratory medications (including antihistamines, anti-asthmatic, and nasal, cough 
and cold, and throat preparations) during the cumulative period. 
2.  MLA (haematuria, RBC and WBC) in urine 
In  the  2  -  5  year  age  cohort,  urine  WBC  were  observed  in  10/28  (35.7%)  of  subjects,  compared  to 
8/25 (32.0%) of subjects as reported in the interim analysis. Urine RBCs were infrequent in this age 
cohort and observed in 1/25 (4.0%) of subjects, compared to 0/22 of subjects in the interim analysis. 
No new data was provided for assessment for the 6 - 17 year age cohort. 
According to the MAH, possible reasons for the urinary abnormalities of RBCs, WBCs, and blood that 
met  the  MLA  criteria  include  AEs  associated  and  not  associated  with  the  genitourinary  tract,  events 
from past medical history, and/or menstruation in young girls. 
3.  Effect of MTX on ADA formation 
Of  the  36  subjects  in  the  2  -  5  year  age  cohort  who  were  on  MTX,  7  (19.4%)  tested  positive  for 
antibodies to abatacept relative to baseline in the cumulative period; none of the 10 subjects who did 
not  receive  MTX  tested  positive  for  antibodies  to  abatacept  relative  to  baseline  in  the  cumulative 
period  (Table  7).  Three  out  of  4  subjects  with  antibodies  specific  to  CTLA4  and  possibly  Ig  had 
samples  tested  for  neutralising  antibodies;  2  were  positive  for  neutralising  antibodies  during  post 
treatment visits. 
Table 7. Summary of Immunogenicity According to MTX Treatment for Subjects in the 2 - 5 
Year Age Cohort 
Of  the  135  subjects  in  the  6  -  17  year  age  cohort  who  were  on  MTX,  8  (5.9%)  tested  positive  for 
antibodies to abatacept relative to baseline in the cumulative period; none of the 37 subjects who did 
not receive MTX tested positive (Table  8). Three out of 5 subjects with antibodies specific to CTLA4 
and  possibly  Ig  had  samples  tested  for  neutralising  antibodies;  none  were  positive  for  neutralising 
antibodies.

Page 16/39 
 
 
 
 
Table 8. Summary of Immunogenicity According to MTX Treatment for Subjects in the 6 - 17 
Year Age Cohort 
According to the MAH, the number of subjects on MTX treatment at Day 1 was 3.6 times that of those 
not on MTX at Day 1 for both age cohorts; therefore, although immunogenicity incidence was higher 
for groups on MTX treatment on Day 1, it cannot conclusively be determined if MTX treatment on Day 
1 had an impact on immunogenicity. According to the MAH, the overall incidence was low irrespective 
of  age  cohort  or  if  subjects  had  received  MTX-treatment  at  Day  1,  and  there  was  no  measurable 
clinical impact. 
4.  Age dependency of ADA response 
Overall,  15  out  of  218  (6.9%)  subjects  had  a  positive  immunogenicity  response  relative  to  baseline 
during the cumulative period of the study. Across the cumulative period, in the 6 - 17 year age cohort, 
8 (4.7%) of 172 tested subjects developed anti-abatacept antibodies; 5 (2.9%) subjects were positive 
for  CTLA4  and  possibly  Ig,  and  3  (1.7%)  subjects  developed  antibodies  specific  to  the  Ig  and/or 
junction region of abatacept. The titres for all positive results were ≤ 176 and generally transient (i.e., 
not positive on ≥ 2 consecutive test dates), and no neutralising antibodies were detected. In the 2 - 5 
year  age  cohort,  7  (15.2%)  of  46  tested  subjects  developed  anti-abatacept  antibodies;  4  (8.7%) 
subjects  had  antibodies  specific  to  CTLA4  and  possibly  Ig,  of  which  1  had  2  consecutive  positive 
results  tested  for  neutralising  antibodies  (1  tested  negative  for  neutralising  antibodies  and  1  sample 
was not tested), 2 subjects each had 1 positive sample with neutralisation activity and 1 subject was 
not tested. Three (6.5%) subjects developed antibodies specific to the Ig and/or junction region; titres 
for all but 1 subject were ≤ 155. 
According  to  the  MAH,  efficacy,  safety,  and  PK  were  similar  between  subjects  with  and  without 
positive immunogenicity response to abatacept, no AEs were attributed to an immune-mediated event 
in subjects with positive immunogenicity and the results indicate no clinical relevance for the detected 
ADAs. Although these numbers indicate a higher incidence in the 2 - 5 year age cohort, the difference 
in sample size makes it difficult to determine if the differences are meaningful, especially since in both 
cohorts ADA had no measurable clinical impact. 
5.  AEs occurring within 24 hours in the pJIA studies 
Compared  to  the  interim  report,  no  new  AEs  occurring  within  24  hours  of  study  drug 
administration were reported in the study. 
6.  Relatedness of AEs to study drug 
In the cumulative period, 30/46 (65.2%) subjects in the 2 - 5 year age cohort and 54/173 (31.2%) 
subjects in the 6 - 17 year age cohort had AEs assessed to be related to study drug. According to the 
MAH,  the  imbalance  in  AEs  related  to  study  drug  between  the  two  age  cohorts  is  mostly  due  to  the 
difference in within the SOC Infections and Infestations. Subjects in the 2 - 5 year age cohort had a 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/257651/2019  
Page 17/39 
 
 
 
 
higher percentage of infections (52.2%) compared to subjects in the 6 - 17 year age cohort (20.8%). 
The  percentage  of  infections  was  higher  in  the  younger  age  cohort  because  upper  respiratory  tract 
infections (ear, nose, and throat) are the most common pathology in children 6 months to 6 years of 
age.  Children  less  than  6  years  of  age  also  have  a  high  prevalence  of  infections  due  to  recurrent 
respiratory  infections  from  their  exposure  to  other  children,  attendance  at  day  care  and  exposure  to 
new pathogens. The MAH concluded that, with the exception of expected age-related differences (i.e., 
increased infections in the younger age cohort), the safety profiles were similar in both age cohorts. 
7.  Immunogenic potential of the lubricant silicon oil 
No specific follow-up was provided on the possible immunogenic effect/adjuvant potential of the silicon 
oil contained in the different types of syringes. 
Pharmacokinetic results 
As seen in Table 9, the abatacept trough concentrations in the 2 - 5 year age cohort remained stable 
over time, and there was very little change compared to data in the interim report. Beyond Day 113, 
individual  Cmin  levels  below  the  target  therapeutic  exposure  level  of  10  ug/mL  were  noted  in 
2 evaluable  subjects.  As  noted  above,  a  Cmin  value  of  <  10  μg/mL  was  reported  for  one  subject on 
days 645 and 729 concurrently with detection of a positive immunogenicity response; this subject had 
missed 2 consecutive weekly doses 35 and 42 days prior to Day 645. 
Table 9. Summary Statistics of Abatacept Cmin Values during the Cumulative Period: 
Evaluable PK Population - 2 - 5 Year Age Cohort 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The 24-month study report provided updated complete data for the LTE period in the 2 - 5 year age 
cohort and summarised previously unreported data for the 6 - 17 year age cohort. Overall, the newly 
reported  data  are  consistent  with  the  interim  report  assessed  as  part  of  completed  procedure 
EMEA/H/C/000701/X/0117/G, and evidence of treatment benefit of SC abatacept in the younger age 
cohort remains robust within the updated data. It is noted that in both age cohorts, the most common 
reason for discontinuation was lack of efficacy (5 subjects [10.9%] in the 2 -  5-year age cohort and 
17 subjects [9.8%] in the 6 - 17 year age cohort). On request, the MAH discussed the lack of efficacy, 
resulting  in  discontinuation,  seen  in  the  current  SC  study  (IM101301)  and  compared  it  to  previous 
paediatric studies, particularly study IM101033 using intravenous abatacept, to determine whether the 
mode of administration of abatacept (SC versus IV) could have a possible role in the lack of efficacy 
observed. It was concluded that the currently available data, namely, the available comparative data, 
is  scarce  and  fragmented,  therefore,  firm  conclusion  cannot  be  drawn.  Thus,  this  issue  should  be 
revisited when the 5-year follow-up data becomes available. The MAH is expected and has agreed to 
provide these data as a separate post-authorisation commitment by the date specified in the RMP. 
With  regard  to  safety,  the  signals  already  noted  during  review  of  the  interim  data  remain  largely 
unchanged, and the frequency of drug-related AEs as well as the frequency of ADAs remain higher in 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/257651/2019  
Page 18/39 
 
 
 
 
the 2 - 5 year age cohort compared to the 6 - 17 year age cohort. The difference in drug-related AEs 
still  seems  to  be  largely  accounted  for  by  the  difference  in  infectious  AEs,  and  the  MAH’s  previously 
accepted  explanation  of  this  difference  being  due  to  an  increased  general  frequency  of  upper 
respiratory  tract  infections  in  this  age  cohort  still  seems  acceptable.  In  particular,  there  is  no 
additional evidence of any iatrogenic effect in the 24-month report. However, it is recognised that two 
previously reported infectious SAEs in the paediatric population (varicella and sepsis) are individually 
identified  in  Section  4.8 of  the  current  SmPC;  as  the  experience  from  the  2  -  5  year  age  cohort  still 
remains  very  limited,  the  MAH  justified  acceptably  that  the  single  SAE,  limb  abscesses,  should  be 
individually described in the SmPC Section 4.8. However, the overall available data on the single SAE 
of cellulitis does not justify inclusion the SmPC. 
Moreover,  the  study  demonstrated  a  very  high  general  level  of  infections  throughout  the  paediatric 
population, with younger children (2-5 years) being more affected than the older cohort. In line with 
these  data,  the  MAH  agreed  to  add  a  text  to  the  SmPC  stating  that  a  higher  incidence  of  infection 
(87.0%  vs  68.2%),  mostly  upper  respiratory  tract  infections,  was  reported  in  younger  children  with 
pJIA (2 to 5-year old) treated with SC abatacept compared to older children with pJIA (6 to 17-year 
old). 
There is no new aggravating information regarding the immunogenicity of abatacept in the 2 - 5 year 
age cohort compared to the interim data. The ADA frequency remains indeed higher in the 2 - 5 year 
age  cohort  on-treatment  (10.9%  versus  2.3%  in  the  older  group),  and  especially  in  the  post-
treatment  phase  (37.5%  versus  13.6%).  Acknowledging  the  low  number  of  samples  analysed  post-
treatment, the phenomenon seems similar to that seen in adults and presented in the SmPC. Although 
the  significance  of  these  differences  remains  uncertain,  the  MAH  agreed  to  update  the  Paediatric 
population/Description  of  selected  adverse  reactions/Immunogenicity  in  patients  with  pJIA  treated 
with  subcutaneous  abatacept  paragraph  in  SmPC  Section  4.8,  by  including  results  from  each  age 
cohort separately. The labeling revisions will be assessed in detail in context the upcoming post article 
46 type II variation. 
The MAH also further discussed, as requested, the possible immunogenic effect/adjuvant potential of 
the silicon contained in the different types of syringes. In the study IM101301, no apparent reason for 
the higher ADA incidence observed in the 2 to 5-year age cohort could be established. Namely, it could 
not  be  established  that  this  difference  would  in  any  way  be  related  to  the  type  of  syringes  or  the 
silicon  oil  content  (same  syringe  was  used  in  both  age  cohorts;  higher  incidence  of  ADAs  in  the  IV 
pJIA-study, which did not use siliconized syringes). It is agreed with the MAH that in this study set up 
undoubtedly  uncertainties  will  remain  related  to  the  silicone  issue;  however,  this  issue  will  not  be 
pursued  further.  However,  these  findings  on  immunogenicity  in  general  are  considered  as  valuable 
information for prescribers, and thus the SmPC should be updated to include this novel information in 
the  upcoming  post  art.  46  type  II  variation.  In  addition,  recognising  the  overall  limited  information 
available with respect to immunogenicity, the immunogenicity issue should be further followed by the 
MAH. Immunogenicity will also be re-evaluated at the 5-year follow-up of Study IM101301 as part of a 
separate post-authorisation commitment by the date specified in the RMP. 
The observations of MLAs of eosinophilia as well as urinary WBC and RBC remain unchanged from the 
interim report, and although any definitive explanation for the eosinophilia remains elusive, it does not 
seem  to  be  associated  with  clinical  AEs.  The  same  holds  true  for  the  urinary  findings.  However,  the 
MAH  provided  an  acceptable  justification  that  these  findings  appear  not  to  be  informative  to  the 
prescribing  physician  and  do  not  call  for  a  SmPC  revision.  In  addition,  the  laboratory  findings  of  MLA 
values for low blood glucose, elevated creatinine, elevated potassium and low blood leukocytes, in this 
study  population  of  pJIA  patients  on  SC  abatacept  treatment,  appeared  not  to  represent  new  safety 
signals  for  abatacept  and  appeared,  not  to  be  clinically  meaningful  to  the  prescribing  physician. 
Therefore, no update of the SmPC is called for. The MAH presented proposed changes to the PI, which

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/257651/2019  
Page 19/39 
 
 
 
will be assessed in the post article 46 type II variation.  In addition, the MAH is expected to provide the 
final  5-year  follow-up  results,  with  a  further  discussion  on  the  safety  aspects  previously  identified  by 
the CHMP, as a separate post-authorisation commitment by the date specified in the RMP. 
The overall benefit-risk profile of abatacept remains unchanged. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Adequate responses to the all eight questions of the requested “Additional clarification request” have 
been provided by the MAH (see section 5, “Assessment of MAH responses to the Additional clarification 
requested”).  
No  additional  efficacy  or  PK  data  will  be  collected  for  the  study  beyond  the  20-month  LTE.  No  new 
safety  signals  have  been  identified  and  the  data  reported  in  this  submission  are  consistent  with 
previously reported data for study IM101301. The Article 46 requirements are considered fulfilled with 
the present submission; however, the MAH should submit within 60 days a variation to update the PI 
and  the  RMP  with  those  new  data.  The  RMP  should  be  updated  to  state  that  2-year  results  for  the 
study  have  been  submitted.  In  addition,  the  MAH  is  expected  to  provide  the  final  5-year  follow-up 
results,  with  a  further  discussion  on  the  safety  aspects  previously  identified  by  the  CHMP,  as  a 
separate post-authorisation commitment by the date specified in the RMP. 
There is no change in the general benefit-risk profile of ORENCIA.  
  Fulfilled with follow-up: 
The MAH should submit within 60 days a variation to update the PI and the  RMP with the data from 
the Article 46 submission. The RMP should be updated to state that 2-year results for the study have 
been submitted. In addition, the MAH is expected to provide the final 5-year follow-up results, with a 
further  discussion  on  the  safety  aspects  previously  identified  by  the  CHMP,  as  a  separate  post-
authorisation commitment by the date specified in the RMP. 
4.  Additional clarification requested (in 05/2019) 
Based  on  the  data  submitted,  the  MAH  should  address  the  following  questions  as  part  of  this 
procedure: 
1.  The MAH should discuss lack of efficacy, resulting in discontinuation, seen in the current study 
(IM101301)  and  compare  to  previous  paediatric  studies,  particularly  study  IM101033  using 
intravenous  abatacept.  Does  the  MAH  consider  the  mode  of  administration  of  abatacept  (SC 
versus IV) to have any effect on the lack of efficacy observed? 
2.  Two previously reported infectious SAEs in the paediatric population (varicella and sepsis) are 
individually  identified  in  Section  4.8  of  the  current  SmPC.  As  the  experience  from  the  2  -  5 
year  age  cohort  still  remains  very  limited,  the  MAH  should  discuss  whether  either  or  both  of 
the  two  newly  identified  SAEs  (limb  abscess  and  cellulitis)  in  this  age  cohort  should  also  be

3.  A  very  high  general  level  of  infections  throughout  the  paediatric  population  was  observed  in 
the  study,  with  younger  children  (2-5  years)  being  more  affected  than  the  older  cohort.  The 
MAH should discuss whether further detail concerning infections should be incorporated in the

7.  Section 5.1. of the SmPC describes 15 patients in the 2 - 5 year age cohort as ongoing in the 
2-year period, and this section should be updated within 60 days of finalisation of the Art. 46 
process. 
8.  The RMP should also be updated within 60 days of finalisation of the Art. 46 process to state 
that the 2-year results have been submitted. 
The timetable is a 30-day response timetable with clock stop. 
5.  Assessment of MAH responses to Additional clarification 
requested 
Question 1 
The  MAH  should  discuss  lack  of  efficacy,  resulting  in  discontinuation,  seen  in  the  current  study 
(IM101301)  and  compare  to  previous  paediatric  studies,  particularly  study  IM101033  using 
intravenous abatacept. Does the MAH consider the mode of administration of abatacept (SC versus IV) 
to have any effect on the lack of efficacy observed? 
MAH response  
The  mode  of  administration  does  not  appear  to  have  an  effect  on  the  efficacy  observed;  response 
rates  with  both  IV  and  SC  dosing  showed  high  effectiveness.  The  most  common  reason  for 
discontinuation in subcutaneous (SC) Study IM101301 was lack of efficacy (LOE). Subjects from Study 
IM101301 were stratified by age cohort (2 age cohorts: 2 through 5 year old and 6 through 17 year 
old)  to  receive  open  label  (OL)  weight-  tiered  SC  abatacept  (10  to  <25  kg  [50  mg],  25  to  <50  kg 
[87.5 mg], ≥ 50 kg [125 mg]) weekly for 24 months. The mean duration of the cumulative period was 
22.3 ± 6.21 months for the 2 to 5-year age cohort and 21.8 ± 6.87 months for the 6 to 17 year age 
cohort, respectively.  The incidence of discontinuation due to LOE at Month 4 (time of the primary PK 
endpoint) and cumulative period was: 
Month 4: 5 (2.3%) of 219 subjects 
-2  through  5  year  age  cohort:  2  (4.3  %)  of  46  subjects 
-6 through 17 year age cohort: 3 (1.7%) of 173 subjects 
Cumulative Period: 22 (10.0%) of 219 subjects 
-2 through 5 year age cohort: 5 (10.9%) of 46 subjects 
-6 through 17 year age cohort: 17 (9.8%) of 173 subjects 
In Study IM101301, the discontinuation rates due to LOE were lower in the older age cohort at Month 
4 and similar during the cumulative period.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/257651/2019  
Page 21/39 
 
 
 
The abatacept IV study, Study IM101033, had discontinuation rates due to LOE in 3 separate periods 
due to its randomized, placebo-controlled withdrawal study design: 
Period  A:  4  month,  open-label,  lead  in  period.  Subjects  were  dosed  with  abatacept  10  mg/kg  IV  on 
Days 1, 15, 29 and monthly thereafter. The efficacy endpoint at Month 4 was the ACRp30. A total of 
17 (8.9%) of 190 subjects discontinued due to LOE. 
Period  B:  6  month,  randomized,  double  blind,  placebo-controlled  withdrawal  period.  Only  ACRp30 
responders  of  Period  A  at  Month  4  could  be  randomized  into  Period  B.  Subjects  were  dosed  with 
abatacept  10  mg/kg  IV  on  a  monthly  basis.  The  efficacy  endpoint  at  Month  6  was  the  time  to  flare 
rate. Discontinuation rates due to LOE were: 
-Abatacept: 10 (16.7%) of 60 subjects 
-Placebo: 31 (50 %) of 60 subjects 
Period  C:  Open  label  period  for  5  years.  A  total  of  24  (15.7%)  of  153  subjects  who  participated  in 
Period C discontinued due to LOE (as-observed analysis). Subjects who participated in Period C came 
from 3 cohorts: 
-Period A Non-responders: 11 (30.6%) of 36 subjects 
-Period B Abatacept-receiving subjects: 5 (8.6%) of 58 subjects 
-Period B Placebo-receiving subjects: 8 (13.6%) of 59 subjects 
The  overall  15.7%  discontinuation  rate  due  to  LOE  observed  during  Period  C  is  low  since  the  mean 
duration of Period C was 53.2 ± 21.0 months. 
The only relevant direct comparison of discontinuation rates due to LOE between the two studies that 
can  be  made  is  between  the  initial  4  months  of  OL  abatacept  treatment  in  SC  Study  IM101301  and 
Period  A  (4  months)  of  IV  Study  IM101033.  The  discontinuation  rate  from  LOE  was  2.3%  (5  of 
219 subjects) in the initial 4 months of Study IM101301 and was 8.9% (17 of 190 subjects) in Period 
A  of  Study  IM101033.  The  duration  of  comparison  is  relatively  short  (4  months)  and  these 
discontinuation rates do not appear to be different enough to draw a definitive conclusion that there is 
a higher discontinuation rate with administration of IV abatacept. 
Other  comparisons  of  the  discontinuation  rates  due  to  LOE  between  SC  abatacept  Study  IM101301 
and IV abatacept Study IM101033 are confounded by the following issues: 
• 
• 
• 
The subjects in Period B of Study IM101033 are not the same as subjects who enrolled in Study 
IM101301  because  subjects  in  Period  B  of  Study  IM101033  are  all  responders  to  4  months  of 
abatacept treatment (during Period A) before randomization into Period B. Discontinuation rates 
due to LOE in Period B of Study IM101033 cannot be compared to any discontinuation rate due 
to LOE from Study  IM101301. 
The  subjects  in  Period  C  of  Study  IM101033  come  from  3  cohorts,  including  subjects  who 
were  non-responders  from  Period  A,  placebo-treated  subjects  from  Period  B,  and  subjects  who 
have  been  treated  with  abatacept  during  both  Period  A  (4  months)  and  Period  B  (6  months). 
This population is therefore not comparable to subjects who enrolled in Study IM101301. 
The mean (±SD) duration of exposure to continuous abatacept treatment during the cumulative 
period in Study IM101301 is shorter than the mean duration of continuous abatacept treatment 
in  Period  C  (53.2  ±  21.0  months)  (Table  6.1A  from  the  IM101033  CSR  Addendum  3). 
Therefore, comparison of the discontinuation rates due to LOE cannot be properly interpreted. 
In  summary, the clinical response rates to IV abatacept (Study IM101033) and SC abatacept (Study 
IM101301) were high, indicating that abatacept is highly effective in children with pJIA.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/257651/2019  
Page 22/39 
 
 
 
A  comparison  of  the  discontinuation  rates  due  to  LOE  (during  the  initial  4  months  of  abatacept 
treatment)  does  not  suggest  that  the  mode  of  administration  (SC  versus  IV)  of  abatacept  had  an 
impact  on  the  discontinuation  rate  due  to  LOE  observed  in  these  two  trials  during  the  cumulative 
period. 
Assessment MAH response  
The MAH has, as requested, discussed lack of efficacy, resulting in discontinuation, seen in the current 
SC  study  (IM101301)  and  compared  it  to  previous  paediatric  studies,  particularly  study  IM101033 
using  intravenous  abatacept,  to  determine  whether  the  mode  of  administration  of  abatacept  (SC 
versus IV) may have a possible role in the lack of efficacy reported. Overall, the direct comparison of 
the two studies is hampered by differences in methodological issues, for example, in the design of the 
studies and the study populations (in the different phases of the studies). The results from the most 
applicable period for the comparison, a period of only four months, did not indicate clear difference in 
lack  of  efficacy,  according  to  the  mode  of  administration  of  abatacept.  Other  comparative  analyses 
were confounded to the extent that relevant interpretations of the data could not be made. 
In  conclusion,  based  on  the  limited  data  currently  available,  it  can  be  agreed  on  with  the  MAH,  that 
the  mode of  administration  of  abatacept  (SC  versus  IV)  appeared  not  to  have  a  significant  effect  on 
the lack of efficacy observed. However, the currently available data, namely the available comparative 
data is scarce and fragmented, therefore, firm conclusion cannot be drawn. Thus, this issue should be 
revisited  when  the  5-year  follow-up  data  for  the  SC  study  IM101301  becomes  available.  The  MAH  is 
expected and has agreed to provide these data as a separate post-authorisation commitment by the 
date specified in the RMP. 
Conclusions 
Issue resolved. 
Question 2 
Two  previously  reported  infectious  SAEs  in  the  paediatric  population  (varicella  and  sepsis)  are 
individually identified in Section 4.8 of the current SmPC. As the experience from the 2 - 5 year age 
cohort  still  remains  very  limited,  the  MAH  should  discuss  whether  either  or  both  of  the  two  newly 
identified  SAEs  (limb  abscess  and  cellulitis)  in  this  age  cohort  should  also  be  similarly  described  or 
included in the current characterisation. 
MAH response  
Limb Abscess 
One 3-year old patient from the 2 to 5 year age cohort experienced a serious adverse event (SAE) of 
Abscess  limb  (right  thigh)  on  Day  666  that  was  assessed  as  severe  in  intensity  and  related  to 
subcutaneous (SC) abatacept 50 mg weekly. The child was treated with amoxicillin for 6 days and had 
surgery, with resolution of the event 19 days after. . This was the only event of Abscess (incidence of 
2.2%) reported in the 2 through 5 year age cohort (total n= 46). 
This  patient  was  not  on  corticosteroids  during  the  onset  of  the  Abscess,  but  was  on  methotrexate 
(MTX)  10  mg/week  from  10-Apr-2017  to  18-Dec-2017.  MTX  may  or  may  not  have  contributed  to  a 
higher rate of infection in children with pJIA. 
Hospitalization  for  bacterial  infections  related  to  skin  and  soft  tissues  have  been  reported  in  12%  of 
children with pJIA.
However, the literature is scarce with respect to an assessment of abscesses (and 
infections) in children with pJIA who are 2 through 5 years of age. 
Due to the serious nature, severity, relatedness to abatacept, and lack of additional risk factors (other 
than  pJIA)  for  infection  (e.g.,  corticosteroid  use),  the  MAH  agrees  to  individually  describe  the  limb 
abscess in the Paediatric population/Description of selected adverse reactions/Infections paragraph of 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

the  current  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  (SmPC)  Section  4.8  (see  all  proposed  labeling 
revisions to the SmPC Section 4.8 at the end of the response to Question 5). 
Cellulitis 
One 2-year old patient from the 2 through 5 year age cohort experienced a SAE of Cellulitis (left ankle 
and  thigh)  on  Day  674  that  was  assessed  as  moderate  in  intensity  and  not  related  (based  on 
investigator’s judgment) to SC abatacept 50 mg weekly. Next year, fever and skin infection of the left 
ankle  and  thigh  was  resistant  to  the  analgesic  metamizole.  Cellulitis  was  then  diagnosed.  The  child 
was  treated  with  antibiotics;  treatment 
included  IV  cephalexin,  IV  clindamycin  and  oral 
sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim  and the infection resolved 11 days later. Study drug was interrupted 
during the event and resumed afterwards. 
The incidence of Cellulitis in the 2 through 5 year age cohort in this study is 2.2%. 
The MAH assessed that this SAE of cellulitis should not be described in Section 4.8 the SmPC for the 
following reasons: 
1)  This child was on concomitant corticosteroid therapy during the onset of cellulitis. Corticosteroids 
are  known  to  increase  the  risk  for  infection  in  children  with  pJIA  and  increase  the  rate  of 
hospitalized bacterial infections in these children. 
2)  Therefore,  the  event  is  more  likely  related  to  concomitant  corticosteroid  therapy  but  unlikely 
related to abatacept use; the MAH does not think that listing this event in the SmPC would provide 
any relevant information to guide the  prescriber.

Assessment MAH response  
As  two  previously  reported  infectious  SAEs  in  the  paediatric  population  (varicella  and  sepsis)  are 
individually identified in Section 4.8 of the current  SmPC, the MAH  was requested to discuss whether 
either or both of the two newly identified SAEs (limb abscess and cellulitis) in the 2 - 5 year age cohort 
should  also  be  similarly  described,  as  experience  overall  from  the  2 -  5  year  age  cohort  still  remains 
very limited. 
The MAH has provided the narratives of these two single SAE cases. Based on the data provided, the 
MAH proposes, that limb abscesses should be individually described in the SmPC Section 4.8. owing to 
the serious nature, severity and relatedness of this SAE to abatacept treatment, and due to the lack of 
any  additional  risk  factors  (other  than  pJIA)  for  infection  (for  example,  corticosteroid  use).  Overall, 
this justification can be agreed on. 
On the other hand, a single case of cellulitis, deemed a SAE, was reported in a 2-year old pJIA patient. 
The patient was on concomitant corticosteroid treatment (an acknowledged risk factor for infections) 
at the time of onset of the infection. The cellulitis was, based on investigator’s judgment, not related 
to the SC abatacept therapy (evidence of causality was not evident) and considered most likely to be 
related  to  the  concomitant  corticosteroid  treatment.  The  infection  was  moderate  in  severity  and 
responded rapidly to antibiotic treatment. Overall, the clinical course and response to treatment was 
considered  not  to  be  unusual  or  unexpected.  Thus,  the  overall  available  data  on  this  single  SAE  of 
cellulitis does not justify a description in section 4.8 the SmPC. 
Conclusions  
Issue resolved. 
Question 3 
A very high general level of infections throughout the paediatric population was observed in the study, 
with younger children (2-5 years) being more affected than the older cohort. The MAH should discuss 
whether further detail concerning infections should be incorporated in the SmPC. 
MAH response  
A response to the EMA regarding the higher incidence of infections in the 2 through 5 year age cohort 
compared to the 6 through 17 year age cohort in SC Study IM101301 was submitted on 12-Oct-2018 
(response 
to  Question  #14 
of 
the  Day  120 
List 
of  Questions 
in 
procedure 
EMEA/H/C/000701/X/0117/G).
The higher incidence of infection in the younger age cohort was due to 
a higher incidence of upper respiratory tract infections, which is seen in very young children. The EMA 
requested that a comparative analysis be performed once the 2 through 5 year age cohort (n = 46) 
had completed the cumulative period of Study IM101301. 
Forty (87.0%) of 46 subjects in the 2 through 5 year age cohort were reported to have an infection 
during the cumulative period compared to 118 (68.2%) of 173 subjects in the 6 through 17 year age 
cohort (Supplemental Table S.6.34 of the 24-month IM101301 CSR
and Supplemental Table S.6.4 of 
January 2018 CSR). The incidence rate (confidence interval) for infections in the 2 through 5 year age 
cohort  (n  =  40)  during  the  cumulative  period  was  164.97  (121.01,  224.91)  per  100  person-years 
(Table S.6.34 of the 24-month IM101301 CSR). The incidence rate (confidence interval) for infections 
in the 6 through 17 year old cohort (n = 118) during the cumulative period was 79.81 (66.64, 95.59) 
per 100 person-years.

2 Through 5 Year Age Cohort 
In  the  2  through  5  year  age  cohort,  the  most  commonly  reported  infections  were  infections  of  the 
upper  respiratory  tract:  Nasopharyngitis  (17  subjects,  37.0%),  Upper  respiratory  tract  infection 
(10 subjects, 21.7%), Rhinitis (8 subjects, 17.4%), and Pharyngitis (6 subjects, 13.0%) (Table S.6.14 
of  24-month  IM101301  CSR).  Most  subjects  had  single  occurrences  of  an  infection  (Supplemental 
Table  S.6.45  of  24-month  IM101301  CSR).  Six  subjects  (13.0%)  experienced  2  to  non-serious 
occurrences of Nasopharyngitis, and 4 subjects (8.7%) experienced at least 4 non-serious occurrences 
of Nasopharyngitis (Supplemental Table S.6.45 of 24-month IM101301 CSR). 
The  most  common  upper  respiratory  infections  (>  10%)  that  were  related  to  study  drug  included 
Nasopharyngitis  (11  subjects,  23.9%),  Upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (6  subjects,  13.0%),  and 
Rhinitis (5 subjects, 10.9%). 
All  infections  were  mild to  moderate  except  for  an  infection  reported  for  one Subject  (Limb  abscess) 
(See Response to Question 2). One subject discontinued the study due to AEs of Pyrexia, Rhinitis, and 
Cough. 
Two  (4.3%)  of  the  46  children  in  the  2  through  5  year  age  cohort  were  reported  with  serious 
infections (Limb abscess and Cellulitis). 
All infections were reported to have resolved during the cumulative period except in two subjects with 
molluscum contagiosum (onset on Day 722 for one subject and onset on Day 197 for the other). Both 
AEs were mild, not related to study drug, and did not result in either interruption or discontinuation of 
abatacept. 
6 Through 17 Year Age Cohort 
In  the  6  through  17  year  age  cohort,  the  most  commonly  reported  infections  during  the  cumulative 
period  (based  on  152  subjects  with  AEs)  were  infections  of  the  upper  respiratory  tract: 
Nasopharyngitis (52 subjects, 30.1%) and Upper respiratory tract infection (32 subjects, 18.5%). 
The  most  common  upper  respiratory  infections  (>  10%)  that  were  related  to  study  drug  included 
Nasopharyngitis (23 subjects, 13.3%) and Upper respiratory tract infection (8 subjects, 4.6%) (Table 
S.10 of January 2018 CSR). 
All  infections  were  of  mild  or  moderate  intensity,  except  for  1  case  of  Sepsis    that  was  severe  in 
intensity. The subject who experienced Sepsis discontinued from the study. 
Four  subjects  from  the  6  through  17  year  age  cohort  were  reported  with  a  serious  infection  (one 
subject  with  Appendicitis,  one  subject  with  Pneumonia,  one  subject  with  Pyelonephritis,  and    one 
subject  with Sepsis). 
All infections were reported to have resolved during the  cumulative period except in 3 subjects: one 
with  Nasopharyngitis  onset  on  Day  26,  one  with  Bronchitis  onset  on  Day  721,  and  one  with  Fungal 
mycosis onset on Day 459. All cases were mild and only the Bronchitis was felt to be related to study 
drug. None of the infections resulted in interruption or discontinuation of abatacept. The resolution of 
Sinusitis (Day 467 onset) was reported as unknown. 
Summary 
The  percentage  of  infections  was  higher  in  the  2  through  5  year  age  cohort  (87.0%)  than  the 
6 through  17  year  age  cohort  (68.2%),  mostly  because  of  the  higher  incidence  of  upper  respiratory 
airway infections during the cumulative period. This result is similar to that observed in the previous 
response to Question #14 of the Day 120 List of Questions of EMEA/H/C/000701/X/0117/G procedure 
submitted on 12-Oct-2018. All infections in both age cohorts were mild to moderate except 1 infection 
reported  in  a  subject  in  the  2  through  5  year  age  cohort  (Severe  limb  abscess)  and  1  infection

reported in a subject in the 6 through 17 year age cohort (Sepsis). Serious infections were infrequent 
in both age cohorts. All infections were reported to have resolved except for Molluscum Contagiosum 
in two children in the 2 through 5 year old cohort and Nasopharyngitis, Bronchitis and Fungal Mycosis, 
respectively, in 3 children in the 6 through 17 year old cohort. 
The  higher  incidence  of  upper  respiratory  airway  infections  is  consistent  with  the  literature;  upper 
respiratory infections (involving the ear, nose, and throat) are the most common pathology in children 
6 months to 6 years of age.
Children less than 6 years of age also have a high prevalence of infections 
due  to  recurrent  respiratory  infections  from  their  exposure  to  other  children  through  attendance  at 
day care and exposure to new pathogens. 
Reflective  of  the  observed  higher  incidence,  the  MAH  agrees  to  add  text  to  the  SmPC  that  a  higher 
incidence  of  infection  (87.0%  vs  68.2%)  (mostly  upper  respiratory  tract  infections)  was  reported  in 
younger  children  with  pJIA  (2  through  5  years  old)  treated  with  SC  abatacept  compared  to  older 
children with pJIA (6 through 17 years old) (see proposed labeling revisions to the SmPC Section 4.8 
at the end of the response to Question 5). 
Assessment MAH response  
A very high general level of infections throughout the paediatric population was observed in the Study 
IM101301, with the younger children (2-5 years) being more affected than children in the older cohort 
(6-17  years).  This  was  already  evident  on  incomplete  data  sets  of  the  interim  analysis,  and  thus  on 
request,  a  comparative  analysis  was  reiterated  on  the  full  data  sets,  when  the  2  to  5-year  old  age 
cohort (n = 46) had completed the cumulative period. 
In  line  with  the  previous  data,  in  both  age  groups,  the  overall  number  of  infections  remained  high, 
with  the  younger  children  being  more  affected.  This  was  mainly  due  to  a  higher  incidence  of  upper 
respiratory  infections  in  the  cumulative  period.  All  infections  in  both  age  cohorts  were  mild  to 
moderate, excepting a sole severe limb abscess in the younger age cohort and a single case of sepsis 
in  the  older  age  group.  Serious  infections  were  infrequent  in  both  age  cohorts.  All  infections  were 
reported  to  have  resolved,  except  for  molluscum  contagiosum  in  two  children  in  the  2  to 5  year  old 
cohort  and  nasopharyngitis,  bronchitis  and  fungal  mycosis,  respectively,  in  3  children  in  the  6  to 
17 year old cohort. 
In line with these data, the MAH agrees to add a text to the SmPC stating that a higher incidence of 
infection  (87.0%  vs  68.2%),  mostly  upper  respiratory  tract  infections,  was  reported  in  younger 
children  with  pJIA  (2  to  5-year  old)  treated  with  SC  abatacept  compared  to  older  children  with  pJIA 
(6 to  17-year  old).  The  proposed  text  revisions  to  the  SmPC  Section  4.8  are  currently  already 
presented  at  the  end  of  the  response  to  Question  5,  but  will  be  assessed  in  detail  in  context  of  the 
post Article 46 type II variation. 
Conclusions  
Issue resolved. 
Question 4 
The  MAH  should  further  discuss  the  findings  of  increased  eosinophils,  white  blood  cells  in  urine  and 
increased ADAs in the 2 - 5 year age cohort, and whether these should be described in the SmPC to 
inform  the  treating  physician.  The  MAH  could  consider  modifying  the  immunogenicity  section  by 
including results for both age groups separately, i.e. 2 - 5-year olds and 6 - 17-year olds.

MAH response  
Increased Eosinophils in the 2 Through 5 Year Age Cohort 
A  response  to  the  EMA  regarding  increased  eosinophils  in  the  2  through  5  year  age  cohort  was 
submitted on 12-Oct-2018 (response to Question  #16 of the  Day 120 List of  Questions in procedure 
EMEA/H/C/000701/X/0117/G).  Of  the  46  subjects  in  the  2  through  5  year  age  cohort  with  pJIA, 
12 (26.1%)  met  the  pre-specified  Marked  Laboratory  Abnormality  (MLA)  threshold  for  eosinophils 
(0.75  x  103 
threshold for  eosinophils, 3 (25.0%) had an AE within ± 21 days of the reported MLA value: Rhinitis, 
cells/µL)  during  the  cumulative  treatment  period.  Of  the  12  subjects  who  met  the  MLA 
Influenza  and  Conjunctivitis    (Table  16-1  in  the  EMA  Response  to  Question  #16).  The  window  for 
inflammatory  mediators  to  enhance  the  survival  of  eosinophils  is  up  to  2  weeks;  a  conservative  21-
day window from the day of the MLA for eosinophils was used to capture any AEs that may have been 
missed  at  the  time  the  eosinophilia  was  documented.  Most  of  these  MLAs  were  isolated  and/or 
intermittent findings in this study. Fifteen of the 46 subjects had not completed the full 24 months of 
abatacept treatment at the time of the January 2018 IM101301 CSR data lock. 
The  24-month  IM101301  CSR  has  2-year  data  on  all  46  subjects  from  the  2  through  5  year  age 
cohort.  Fourteen  (30.4%)  of  the  46  subjects  in  this  age  cohort  met  the  threshold  for  MLA  for 
eosinophils  (Table  6.3.7-1  and  Appendix  7.2.2  of  the  24-month  IM101301  CSR).  Two  subjects  were 
not previously reported in the above-mentioned Response to Day 120 Question #16. One Subject had 
MLA values on Days 478, 646, and 730, and an AE of Hand-foot-and- mouth disease (not associated 
with eosinophilia) was reported on Day 725. One Subject had an isolated MLA value on Day 728; this 
was  not  associated  with  an  AE.  Neither  of  these  two  subjects  had  a  prior  medical  history  that  could 
potentially be associated with eosinophilia. 
One  Subject  had  a  MLA  value  of  high  eosinophils  on  Day  417  and  was  also  reported  with  an  anti-
CTLA4 abatacept antibody; however this antibody occurred 168 days after Day 729 (Month 24). 
Summary 
The EMA Response submitted on 12-Oct-2018
did not find a definitive cause for many of the reported 
MLAs  for  high  eosinophils;  many  of  these  values  were  isolated  and/or  intermittent  during  the 
cumulative period. A high incidence of upper respiratory infection in the 2 through 5 year age cohort is 
expected and was observed during the cumulative period of the study. Viruses such as rhinovirus and 
respiratory  syncytial  virus  are  very  common  infections  in  young  patients  and  can  be  associated  with 
eosinophilia.
Few AEs (Rhinitis,  Influenza, and Conjunctivitis) were reported that could be associated 
with an increased level of eosinophils; since the EMA Response, 2 additional subjects were reported to 
have MLA values of elevated eosinophils, but did not have AEs known to be associated with increased 
eosinophils. Seasonal allergies may have also played a contributing role for eosinophilia in this global 
trial;  5 subjects  with  MLA  values  of  elevated  eosinophils  from  the  2  through  5  year  age  cohort  used 
concomitant  respiratory  medications  (including  antihistamines,  anti-asthmatic,  and  nasal,  cough  and 
cold, and throat preparations) during the cumulative period. Due to the transient and/or isolated MLA 
values  of  elevated  eosinophils,  the  multiple,  potential  etiologies  for  increased  eosinophils  in  this  age 
group, and lack of meaningful association of increased MLA values of eosinophils during treatment with 
abatacept,  the  MAH  assessed  that  this  finding  is  not  informative  to  the  prescribing  physician  and 
therefore, should not be included in the SmPC. 
Increased White Blood Cells in the Urine in the 2 Through 5 Year Age Cohort 
A  response  to  the  EMA  regarding  increased  urine  WBCs  in  the  2  through  5  year  age  cohort  was 
submitted on 12-Oct-2018 (response to Question #15 of the Day 120 List of Questions in procedure 
EMEA/H/C/000701/X/0117/G).
A  total  of  8  of  25  (32.0%)  subjects  with  pJIA  from  this  age  cohort 
were  reported  with  a  MLA  threshold  for  increased  urine  WBCs.  Most  of  the  MLAs  were  transient

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

(Appendix  15.2  and  Appendix  15.3  of  the  January  2018  CSR),  not  associated  with  an  AE  (both  AEs 
associated  with  the  urinary  tract  [e.g.,  urinary  tract  infections]  and  AEs  outside  of  the  urinary  tract 
[e.g., gastroenteritis and vaginal inflammation]), and did not appear to be clinically meaningful. 
In the 2 through 5  year age cohort, as reported in the 24-month IM101301 CSR, 10 (35.7%) of the 
28 subjects  met  the  MLA  threshold  for  increased  urine  WBCs  (Table  6.3.7-1  of  24-month  IM101301 
CSR).  The  2  additional  subjects  with  increased  urinary  WBCs  not  previously  reported  in  the  above 
mentioned Response to Day 120 Question #5 were Subject IM101301-31-227 and Subject IM101301-
50-228;  both  had  solitary  MLA  values.  During  the  24-month  cumulative  period,  9  of  the  10  subjects 
had a single MLA value; only Subject IM101301-60-168 had a MLA value on the same day (Day 197) 
as  an  AE  (Urinary  tract  infection)  (Appendix  7.2.2  of  24-month  IM101301  CSR).  Three  additional 
subjects in the 2 through 5 year age cohort had AEs that could be associated with increased urinary 
WBCs  (Subject  IM101301-14-125  with  Gastroenteritis,  Subject  IM101301-31-227  with  Urinary  tract 
infection,  and  Subject  IM101301-44-214  with  Gastroenteritis)  but  the  single  urinary  WBC  MLA  value 
did not correspond at all to the onset of the respective AE (Appendix 6.2.2 and Appendix 7.7.2 of 24-
month IM101301 CSR). Pyuria was also not reported as an AE in the 2 through 5 year age cohort. 
Summary 
Overall, the increase in urinary WBCs that met the MLA threshold in the 2 through 5 year age cohort 
were mostly solitary findings and not associated with an AE except for in 1 subject. These findings do 
not appear to be clinically meaningful and are not informative to the prescribing physician. Therefore, 
the MAH assessed that modification of the SmPC with the increase in urinary WBCs is not needed. 
Immunogenicity Results 
Although the significance of the immunogenicity results are uncertain, the MAH agrees to update the 
Paediatric  population/Description  of  selected  adverse  reactions/Immunogenicity  in  patients  with  pJIA 
treated  with  subcutaneous  abatacept  paragraph  in  SmPC  Section  4.8  by  including  results  from  each 
age cohort separately, if this is considered valuable information for prescribers. 
The  labeling  revisions  that  would  be  proposed  in  the  context  of  the  upcoming  type  II  variation  are 
provided at the end of the response to Question 5. 
Assessment MAH response  
The  MAH  was  requested  to  further  discuss  the  findings  of  increased  eosinophils,  white  blood  cells  in 
urine and increased ADAs in the 2 - 5 year age cohort, and discuss whether these should be described 
in the SmPC to inform the treating physician. 
Increased eosinophils: As requested, the MAH further discussed the findings of increased eosinophils. 
In the interim assessment, no definitive cause for many of the reported MLAs for high eosinophils were 
found.  Many  of  the  values  were  isolated  and/or  intermittent  during  the  cumulative  period.
Only  few 
AEs  (rhinitis,  influenza  and  conjunctivitis)  were  reported  that  could  be  associated  with  an  increased 
level  of  eosinophils.  Since  this  assessment,  at  the  24-months  follow-up,  the  two  additional  subjects 
were  found  to  have  MLA  values  of  elevated  eosinophils,  but  reported  no  AEs  known  to  be  associated 
with  increased  eosinophils.  These  subjects  appeared  to  have  narratives  similar  to  previous  data  from 
the interim analyses. Thus, the data accrued, to date, remains with uncertainties. Overall, MLA values 
of  elevated  eosinophils  appear  indeed  isolated  and/or  transient  in  nature,  the  possible  etiologies  are 
multiple  and  largely  no  meaningful  associations  could  be  found.  Therefore,  it  can  be  agreed  with  the 
MAH that due to the nature of this finding it appears not to be informative to the prescribing physician 
and does not call for a SmPC revision. 
WBC in urine: In the interim analyses, in the 2 to 5 year age cohort of subjects with pJIA, a finding of 
increased  urine  WBCs  surpassing  the  MLA  threshold  was  seen.  Most  of  the  MLAs  were  solitary  cases 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

and  transient,  they  were  not  clearly  associated  with  an  AE  and  were  deemed  not  to  be  clinically 
meaningful.  Since  then,  at  the  24-months  follow-up,  two  additional  subjects  tested  with  increased 
urinary WBCs not previously reported, both with single occurrences of the MLA test results. Three pJIA 
patients  had  AEs  that  could  have  been  be  associated  with  an  increased  urinary  WBC  MLA  value,  but 
the single value did not correspond to the onset of the respective AE. Pyuria was not reported as an 
AE in this younger age group. Thus, overall, data from the two additional patients appear in line with 
the results of the interim assessment, were this finding of WBC MLA appeared not clinically meaningful 
enough or informative enough to the physician to merit a SmPC amendment. 
Immunogenicity: although the significance of a higher rate of ADAs in the younger age group of pJIA 
patients  remains  uncertain,  the  data  are  deemed  as  valuable  information  for  prescribers,  and  thus 
results from each age cohort should be described in the SmPC separately. The MAH agrees to update 
the immunogenicity text on patients with pJIA treated with subcutaneous abatacept in SmPC Section 
4.8 in the upcoming post art. 46 type II variation. 
Conclusions  
Issue resolved. 
Question 5 
The  MAH  should  explain  the  significance  of  other  frequently  observed  MLA’s  identified  in  the  CSR 
(including low glucose, elevated creatinine and elevated potassium), relating the response to both age 
cohorts, and discuss whether other frequently observed MLA’s should be included in an update to the 
SmPC. 
MAH response 
The threshold for the Marked Laboratory Abnormality (MLA) values for all laboratory tests are listed in 
Appendix 7.2.2 of the 24-month IM101301 CSR. These thresholds apply to both the 2 through 5 year 
age  cohort  and  the  6  through  17  year  age  cohort.  The  MLA  thresholds  for  low  glucose,  elevated 
creatinine, and elevated potassium are as follows: 
•  Low (serum) glucose: < 65 mg/dL 
•  Elevated creatinine: > 1.5X Pre-treatment 
•  Elevated potassium: < 0.9X lower limit of normal (LLN) or > 1.1X upper limit of normal (ULN), or 
if Pre-treatment < LLN then use < 0.9X Pre-treatment or > ULN, or if Pre-treatment > ULN then 
use > 1.1X Pre-treatment or < LLN 
A  conservative  window  of  30  days  before  or  after  the  occurrence  of  a  MLA  value  was  used  to 
determine the association of the MLA value to any adverse event (AE). 
Low Glucose 
2 Through 5 Year Age Cohort 
In the 2 through 5 year age cohort, 10 (21.7%) of the 46 subjects were reported with a MLA value for 
low serum glucose during the cumulative period (Table S.7.3 of the 24-month IM101301 CSR). Eight 
of  these  10  children  had  only  a  single  MLA  value  of  low  glucose  during  the  24-month  cumulative 
period, with normal glucose values at study visits before and after the MLA value. Two children (two 
subjects  and)  had  two  episodes  of  MLA  values;  one  subject  had  the  lowest  MLA  value  among  all  10 
children in this age cohort. There did not appear to be any trend  for the onset of these MLA values; 
they occurred any time between Day 28 to Day 486. One subject had tonsillitis and constipation within 
30 days of the MLA value.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/257651/2019

None of the MLA values among these 10 subjects were associated with AEs or symptoms that could be 
associated with hypoglycemia (eg, syncope, lightheadedness, and headache) (Appendix 6.11.2 of 24-
month  IM101301  CSR).  In  addition,  none  of  these  10  subjects  were  treated  for  the  MLA  value 
(Appendix 4.2.2) and none had pre-existing diabetes (Appendix 3.3.2). 
6 Through 17 Year Age Cohort 
In the 6 through 17 year age cohort, 36 (20.9%) of the 172 subjects were reported with a MLA value 
for  low  serum  glucose  during  the  cumulative  period  (Table  7.3.7-1  of  the  January  2018  IM101301 
CSR). Of these 36 subjects, 32 had a single MLA value of low glucose during the 24-month cumulative 
period,  with  normal  glucose  values  at  study  visits  immediately  before  and  after  the  MLA  value; 
2 subjects had 2 episodes of MLA values, and 2 other children had 3 episodes of MLA values. 
One  subject  had  eczema,  one  subject  had  proteinuria  and  one  subject  had  Episcleritis,  Respiratory 
Tract Infection and Limb Abscess within 30 days of the MLA value. 
There  did  not  appear  to  be  any  trend  for  the  onset  of  these  MLA  values;  they  occurred  any  time 
between Day 28 to Day 729. Two children had the lowest MLA values for glucose (40 mg/dL) during 
the  cumulative  study  that  were  solitary  values,  were  not  associated  with  an  AE,  and  did  not  require 
treatment. 
None of the MLA values for low glucose in the 36 children in the 6 through 17 year age cohort had AEs 
that can be attributed to hypoglycemia (e.g., Syncope, Lightheadedness, Headache) within 30 days of 
the  MLA  value  (Appendix  6.11.1)  except  for  one  subject  who  was  reported  with  vertigo  on  Day  36 
following an MLA glucose value of 61 mg/dL on Day 23. However, the baseline and Day 57 MLA values 
were  121  mg/dL  and  83  mg/dL,  respectively,  and  the  event  of  Vertigo  was  not  related  to  abatacept 
(based on investigator judgment). None of the MLA values in these 36 children required treatment. 
None  of  the  children  in  Study  IM101301  had  a  past  medical  history  of  diabetes;  one  subject  was 
taking metformin (for polycystic kidney disease) and did not have a MLA value of low glucose during 
the cumulative period. 
Summary 
Hypoglycemia  in  children  is  most  often  associated  with  the  use  of  insulin  or  hypoglycemic  agents;
however, only 1 child was taking a hypoglycemic agent (metformin) and did not have a MLA value for 
low  glucose  (Appendix  3.3.1  and  Appendix  7.2.1  of  the  January  2018  IM101301  CSR).  Other  causes 
for hypoglycemia include a missed meal, prolonged fasting, strenuous exercise, diarrhea or vomiting, 
and illness. The majority of the MLA values for low glucose were solitary values in most of subjects in 
the 2 through 5 and 6 through 17 year age cohorts who experienced a MLA value. There was no trend 
in  the  onset  of  the  MLA  values.  None  of  the  MLA  values  could  be  attributed  to  an  AE  that  clinically 
would be associated with hypoglycemia (within 30 days before or after the MLA value) during the 24-
month  cumulative  period,  including  the  few  subjects  who  had  multiple  MLA  values.  None  of  the 
subjects with MLA values in the 2 through 5 year age cohort nor in the 6 through 17 year age cohort 
required  treatment  for  the  low  glucose  levels,  including  2  children  who  had  the  lowest  MLA  glucose 
values (40 mg/dL). No subject discontinued the study due to an AE associated with low glucose MLA 
value (Section 6.3.4 of the 24-month IM101301 CSR). 
Overall, these low glucose MLA values are not clinically meaningful and do not represent a new safety 
signal for abatacept. The MAH assessed that the SmPC should not be modified to include information 
on the low glucose MLA values observed in subjects with pJIA treated with abatacept.

Elevated Creatinine 
2 Through 5 Year Age Cohort 
In the 2 through 5 year age cohort, 7 (15.2%) of the 46 subjects were reported with a MLA value for 
elevated serum creatinine during the cumulative period (Table S.7.3 of the 24-month IM101301 CSR). 
Of  these  7  subjects,  4  Subjects  had  a  single  MLA  value  of  elevated  creatinine  during  the  24-month 
cumulative period. All 4 subjects had normal creatinine values at study visits before and after the MLA 
value (Appendix 7.2.2 of the 24-month IM101301 CSR). Two children had 2 episodes of MLA values, 
and 1 child had more than 2 episodes of MLA values (Appendix 7.2.2 of the 24-month IM101301 CSR 
and Table 5-3).

Although 2 Subjects had  multiple MLA values for elevated creatinine, all of the MLA  values were  still 
within the normal range for their age. One Subject  has a single MLA value on Day 475 that was above 
the age-adjusted normal range for creatinine, but the MLA value at the next study visit (Day 561) was 
in the normal age-adjusted range. 
In  the  2  through  5  year  age  cohort,  6  of  the  7  subjects  reported  with  MLA  values  for  elevated 
creatinine had normal creatinine levels at the end of the 24 month cumulative period; one Subject had 
an MLA value at Day 650 but it was still within the normal range (Table 5-4). 
None of the 7 subjects with a MLA value for elevated creatinine had a past history of renal disease nor 
an AE that could be associated with renal disease within 30 days of the MLA. 
6 Through 17 Year Age Cohort 
In the 6 through 17 year age cohort, 6 (3.5%) of the 172 subjects were reported with a MLA value for 
elevated serum creatinine during the cumulative period. 
Of these 6 subjects, 3 Subjects 
had  a  single  MLA  value  of  elevated  creatinine  during  the  24  month  cumulative  period;  all  3  subjects 
had normal creatinine values at study visits before and after the MLA value. Three subjects had more 
than a single MLA creatinine value during the cumulative period.

Although 2  subjects  had  multiple  MLA  values  for  elevated  creatinine,  all  of  the  MLA  values  were  still 
within the normal reference range for their age. One subject had a MLA creatinine value on Day 308 
that  exceeded  the  normal  reference  range,  but  the  MLA  value  returned  to  a  normal  creatinine  value 
(0.48 mg/dL) at the following study visit (Day 391). 
Two  subjects  with  multiple  MLA  values  had  an  elevated  MLA  creatinine  value  at  the  end  of  the 
cumulative period but these MLA values were still within the normal reference range for age-adjusted 
creatinine. One subject , who had multiple MLA values, had a normal creatinine value at the end of the 
cumulative period. 
There was no AE that could be associated with renal disease within 30 days of any of the MLA values 
in the 6 children with MLA values for elevated creatinine. In addition, none of these 6 children had a 
past medical history of any renal disease. 
Summary 
In the 2 through 5 year age cohort, 7 (15.2%) subjects had MLA values of elevated creatinine. All of 
the  single  MLA  values  had  resolved  to  normal  values  by  the  next  study  visit.  All  7  children  from  the 
2 through 5 year age cohort had normal creatinine values (by the central laboratory reference range 
for age-adjusted creatinine) at the end of the 24-month cumulative period. 
In the 6 through 17  year  age cohort, 6 (3.5%)  subjects had  MLA  values of elevated creatinine. MLA 
values of 3 of the 6 subjects who had a single MLA value returned to normal values by the next study

visit. Two of 3 of these subjects with multiple MLA values had a MLA value at the end of the 24-month 
cumulative treatment, but these were within the age-adjusted normal reference range for creatinine. 
Overall,  the  elevated  creatinine  MLA  values  are  predominantly  solitary  values.  For  those  subjects  in 
both age cohorts with multiple MLA values, the values were  virtually all within the  normal creatinine 
reference  range  (adjusted  for  their  age).  None  of  these  MLA  values  for  elevated  creatinine  was 
temporally  associated  with  an  AE.  Therefore,  these  MLA  values  are  not  clinically  meaningful  to  the 
prescribing physician and do not represent a new safety signal for abatacept. The MAH assessed that 
the  SmPC  should  not  be  modified  to  include  information  on  the  elevated  creatinine  MLA  values 
observed in the children with pJIA treated with abatacept. 
Elevated Potassium 
2 Through 5 Year Age Cohort 
In  the  2  through  5  year  age  cohort,  4  (8.7%)  of  46  subjects  were  reported  with  a  MLA  value  for 
elevated  potassium  during  the  cumulative  period  (Table  S.7.3  of  the  24-month  IM101301  CSR).  All 
4 subjects had a single MLA value for elevated potassium during the 24-month cumulative period; no 
treatment for hyperkalemia (e.g., insulin, diuretic) was initiated and all MLA values returned to normal 
at  the  following  study  visit  (Appendix  4.2.2  and  Appendix  7.2.2  of  the  24-month  IM101301  CSR). 
None  of  these  values  was  linked  to  an  AE  associated  with  hyperkalemia  (within  30  days  of  the  MLA 
value). 
6 Through 17 Year Age Cohort 
In the 6 through 17  year  age cohort, 4 (2.3%) of the 172 subjects  had an elevated potassium level 
reported  during  the  cumulative  period  (Table  7.3.7-1  of  the  January  2018  IM101301  CSR).  All  4  of 
these subjects had a single MLA value for elevated potassium during the 24-month cumulative period; 
no  treatment  for  hyperkalemia  was  initiated  and  all  MLA  values  returned  to  normal  at  the  following 
study visit (Appendix 4.2.1 and Appendix 7.2.1). None of these values were linked to an AE associated 
with hyperkalemia (within 30 days of the MLA value). 
Summary 
The  MLA  values  for  elevated  potassium  were  solitary  in  both  age  cohorts,  and  were  not  associated 
with an AE. No treatment was initiated for the elevated potassium levels, suggesting that these MLA 
values  were  of  no  clinical  significance.  Overall,  the  MAH  assessed  that  the  SmPC  should  not  be 
modified  to  include  information  on  the  elevated  potassium  MLA  values  observed  in  the  children  with 
pJIA treated with abatacept. 
Low Leukocytes 
Although  the  MLA  values  for  low  leukocytes  were  infrequent  (6.5%)  during  the  cumulative  study 
period  in  SC  Study  IM101301,  it  is  relevant  to  comment  on  this  infrequent  MLA  value,  since  low 
leukocytes may predispose to serious bacterial infections. 
2 Through 5 Year Age Cohort 
In  the  2  through  5  year  age  cohort,  3  (6.5%)  of  the  46  subjects  were  reported  with  MLA  values  for 
low leukocytes during the cumulative period (Table S.7.3 of the 24-month IM101301 CSR). The MLA 
values  for  low  leukocytes  for  all  3  subjects  were  solitary  and  resolved  to  normal  values  by  the  next 
study visit. All infections associated with each subject during the cumulative period are shown in Table 
5-5.

Summary 
The  majority  of  subjects  in  the  2  through  5-year  age  cohort  with  infections  during  the  cumulative 
period did not have MLA values for low leukocytes (Appendix 7.2.2). Infections in the 3 subjects in the 
2  through  5  year  age  cohort  with  MLA  values  for  low  leukocytes  were  not  serious,  were  mild  to 
moderate  in  intensity  and  did  not  require  antibiotic  therapy.  The  duration  between  the  onset  of  an 
infection  and  the  MLA  values  for  low  leukocytes  also  make  their  association  less  likely.  The  MAH 
assessed  that  the  SmPC  should  not  be  modified  to  include  information  on  the  observations  of  low 
leukocytes in subjects from the 2 through 5 year age cohort treated with abatacept. 
The  MAH  proposed  text  revisions  to  Section  4.8  of  the  SmPC  .  However,  the  updated  SmPC  will  be 
part  of  the  type  II  variation  to  be  submitted  within  60  days  after  completion  of  this  Article  46 
procedure (P46 064). 
Assessment MAH response  
The  MAH  was  requested  to  explain  the  significance  of  other  frequently  observed  Marked  Laboratory 
Abnormalities  (MLAs)  in  study  IM101301  (including  low  glucose,  elevated  creatinine  and  elevated 
potassium), relating the response to both age cohorts, and was further requested to discuss whether 
other frequently observed MLA’s should be included in an update to the SmPC. Overall, the thresholds 
for the MLAs were prespecified and a window of 30 days before or after the occurrence of a MLA value 
was used to determine the association of the MLA value to any adverse event (AE). 
Low blood glucose 
In  both  age  groups,  the  majority  of  the  MLA  values  for  low  glucose,  during  the  cumulative  period, 
were  single  occurrences.  The  frequencies  were  similar  between  the  age  groups,  being  21,7%  in  the 
younger and 20,9 % in the older age group. Only a few subjects had multiple values during the 24-
month cumulative period. None of these MLA values could be ascribed to any AE or symptoms possibly 
associated  with  hypoglycemia.  Furthermore,  none  of  the  pJIA  patients  on  abatacept  treatment 
required or  received  treatment  for  the  low  blood  glucose  levels. Moreover,  etiologies  or  any  possible 
trends, of these MLA values for low blood glucose were, overall, not clearly evident. Only one patient 
was treated with a hypoglycemic medicinal product (metformin), but no laboratory result showed MLA 
for low blood glucose. In  all, no history of diabetes was reported in the study population. Overall, in 
both  age  groups  the  MLA  for  low  blood  glucose  values  appeared  not  to  represent  a  clinically 
meaningful safety signal meriting labelling changes. 
Elevated creatinine 
Elevated creatinine MLA values were more often found in pJIA patients on SC abatacept treatment in 
the younger age cohort (15.2%), in comparison to pJIA patients in the older age cohort (3.5%). The 
reason  for  this  difference  was  not  apparent  from  the  provided  data.  No  evidence  of  causality  was 
evident. Overall, in both age groups the elevated creatinine MLA values were mostly single occurrence 
and  returned  to  reference  values  by  the  next  study  visit.  None  of  these  MLA  values  for  elevated 
creatinine  was  associated  with  an  AE.  All  seven  children  in  the  younger  age  group  with  elevated 
creatinine MLA values had age adjusted creatinine values within the reference range at the end of the 
24-month  cumulative  period.  For  subjects  in  both  age  cohorts  with  multiple  MLA  values,  the  values 
were  also  almost  all  within  the  normal  creatinine  reference  range  adjusted  for  their  age.  Thus, an 
elevated creatinine MLA values appears not to be a new safety signal for abatacept in this study group 
of  pJIA  patients  on  SC  abatacept  treatment  and  thus  appears  not  to  be  clinically  meaningful  to  the 
prescribing physician.

Elevated Potassium 
The  test  results  for  elevated  potassium  surpassing  the  MLA  criteria  were  single  occurrences  in  both 
age  cohorts.  They  normalized  by  the  following  study  visit  and  were  not  associated  with  any  AEs  or 
symptoms.  No  treatment  was  required  or  initiated  for  the  pJIA  patients  with  elevated  potassium 
levels. Thus, overall, the elevated potassium MLA values observed in both age cohorts of children with 
pJIA treated with abatacept appear not to be clinically significant. 
Low blood leukocytes 
Although  the  MLA  values  for  low  leukocytes  were  infrequent  (6.5%)  during  the  cumulative  study 
period  in  SC  Study  IM101301,  the  MAH  considered  it  relevant  to  comment  on  this  infrequent  MLA 
value, since low leukocytes may predispose to serious bacterial infections. 
The majority of subjects  with infections, in the  younger cohort, during the cumulative period did not 
have MLA values for low leukocytes. Infections in the three subjects in this cohort, with MLA values for 
low  leukocytes  were  not  serious,  were  mild  to  moderate  in  intensity  and  did  not  require  antibiotic 
therapy. According to the MAH, duration between the onset of an infection and the MLA values for low 
leukocytes  also  make  their  association  not  likely.  Thus,  it  is  agreed  with  the  MAH  that  the  SmPC 
should not be amended on the available data on low leukocytes in subjects from the 2 to 5 year age 
cohort treated with abatacept. No cases of low blood leukocytes were reported in the older 6 to 17 age 
group. 
Overall Conclusions  
Overall, the findings of MLA values for low blood glucose, elevated creatinine, elevated potassium and 
low  blood  leukocytes,  in  this  study  population  of  pJIA  patients  on  SC  abatacept  treatment,  do  not 
appear to represent new safety signals for abatacept and thus appear not to be clinically meaningful 
to the prescribing physician. Therefore, no update of the SmPC is called for. 
Issue resolved. 
Question 6 
No  specific  follow-up  nor  discussion  was  provided  on  the  possible  immunogenic  effect/adjuvant 
potential  of  the  silicon  contained  in  the  different  types  of  syringes;  the  MAH  should  discuss  this,  as 
requested within the variation EMEA/H/C/000701/X/0117/G.

Applicant’s response  
This topic was discussed in the context of procedure EMEA/H/C/000701/X/0117/G, respectively at Day 
120  (Question  27)  and  at  Day  180  (Post-Authorisation  Measure  Question)  and  the  key  elements  are 
summarized and consolidated in this response, as requested. 
In  the  previous  responses,  the  MAH  discussed  the  concern  of  a  potential  impact  of  the  silicon  oil  on 
immunogenicity (IMG), and the quality measures taken to avoid such impact by adding poloxamer 188 
to the formulation. The effectiveness of the measures was supported by the results of quality controls 
on aggregation and available long-term stability data. 
From a clinical standpoint, at the time of the January 2018 IM101301 CSR, there was no measurable 
clinical  impact  (no  associated  effects  on  PK,  loss  of  efficacy,  or  occurrence  of  AEs),  in  patients  with 
Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADAs) in the 2 through 5 year age cohort (as for any other studied population). 
As  part  of  procedure  EMEA/H/C/000701/X/0117/G,  the  RMP  was  updated  (Version  25.2)  to  include 
“Immunogenicity  in  paediatric  patients”  as  missing  information,  while  awaiting  the  full  data  on  the 
2 through 5 year age cohort. 
In Study IM101301 24-month CSR, the ADA frequency was higher in the 2 through 5 year age cohort 
on-treatment  (10.9%  versus  2.3%  in  the  older  group),  and  especially  in  the  post-treatment  phase 
(37.5% versus 13.6% in the older group). However, there is no reason to suspect that this difference 
would  be  related  to  the  type  of  syringe  (or  silicone  oil  content),  as  the  same  type  of  syringes  were 
used  across  the  study  population  in  Study  IM101301  (with  lower  volumes,  hence  lower  overall 
exposure  to  the  silicone  of  the  barrel,  for  lower  strengths).  Although  it  may  not  be  appropriate  to 
make  indirect  comparisons  of  IMG  data  across  these  studies,  it  is  reassuring  to  note  that,  the 
incidence of IMG in Study IM101301 (6.9% of all subjects were seropositive at least once in  p JIA SC 
Study  IM101301)  are  lower  than  those  observed  in  pJIA  IV  Study  IM101033  (23.3%  of  subjects 
were  seropositive  at  least  once  in  pJIA  IV  Study  IM101033  which  didn’t  use  siliconized  syringes). 
Consistent  with  the  overall  clinical  experience  with  abatacept,  no  associated  effects  on  PK,  loss  of 
efficacy,  or  occurrence  of  AEs  were  identified  in  relation  to  IMG  results  in  the  24-month  CSR.  In 
conclusion,  there  is  no  clear  basis  to  suspect  that  the  higher  incidence  of  IMG  observed  in  the 
2 through 5-year age cohort would be related to the type of syringes, no available evidence to further 
explore this hypothesis, and no evidence for a measurable clinical impact of ADA. 
Although  the  significance  of  these  results  is  uncertain,  the  MAH  agrees  to  present  the  data  in  the 
SmPC  and  to  update  the  corresponding  IMG  section  accordingly,  if  this  is  considered  valuable 
information for prescribers (see response to Question 5). 
Assessment MAH response  
The  MAH  has  as  requested,  further  discussed  the  possible  immunogenic  effect/adjuvant  potential  of 
the  silicon  contained  in  the  different  types  of  syringes.  The  immunogenicity  results  of  the  24-month 
follow-up  of  Study  IM101301  appear  consistent  with  the  initially  reported  results  of  the  interim 
analysis.  Although  the  ADA  frequency  continued  to  be  higher  in  the  2  to  5  year  age  cohort  under 
treatment  (10.9%  versus  2.3%  in  the  older  group),  and  especially  in  the  post-treatment  phase 
(37.5%  versus  13.6%  in  the  older  group),  no  clinically  meaningful  associations  with  PK,  loss  of 
efficacy, or occurrence of AEs were found. In this study IM101301, no clearly apparent reason for the 
higher  ADA  incidence  observed  in  the  2  to  5-year  age  cohort  could  be  established;  and  namely,  no 
clear  evidence  could  be  detected  that  this  difference  would  in  any  way  be  related  to  the  type  of 
syringes  or  the  silicon  oil  content  (same  syringe  was  used  in  both  age  cohorts;  higher  incidence  of 
ADAs in the  IV pJIA-study, which did not use siliconized syringes). It is agreed with the MAH that in 
this study set up undoubtedly uncertainties on this issue will remain related to silicone issue, however, 
the  issue  will  not  be  pursued  further.  Nonetheless,  the  findings  on  immunogenicity  in  general  are 
considered  as  valuable information  for  prescribers, and  thus  the  SmPC  should  be  updated to  include

this  novel  information  in  the  upcoming  post  article  46  type  II  variation.  In  addition,  recognising  the 
overall  limited  information  that  is  available  with  respect  to  immunogenicity,  the  issue  of 
immunogenicity  should  be  further  followed  by  the  MAH.  Immunogenicity  will  be  re-evaluated  at  the 
5-year follow-up of Study IM101301 as part of a separate post-authorisation commitment by the date 
specified in the RMP. 
Conclusions  
Issue resolved. 
Question 7 
Section 5.1. of the SmPC describes 15 patients in the 2 - 5 year age cohort as ongoing in the 2-year 
period, and this section should be updated within 60 days of finalisation of the Art. 46 process. 
MAH response  
The MAH agrees to update Section 5.1 of the SmPC to describe that there are no ongoing patients in 
the 2 through 5 year age cohort in the 2 year period. The ORENCIA solution for injection in pre-filled 
syringe  SmPC  Section  5.1  Pharmacodynamic  properties  will  be  modified  as  follows  (see  response  to 
Question 5): Of the 219 subjects treated, 205 completed the short-term period and 200 entered the 
long-term extension period. In the 2 to 5 year age cohort, 39 (84.8%) patients completed two years. 
In the 6 to 17 year age cohort, 132 (76.3%) patients completed two years. 
The  updated  SmPC  will  be  part  of  the  Type  II  variation  to  be  submitted  within  60  days  after 
completion of this Article 46 procedure (EMEA/H/C/000701/P46/064). 
Assessment MAH response 
The  MAH  has  agreed  to  update  section  5.1  of  the  SmPC  as  requested  in  a  type  II  variation  within 
60 days after completion of this Article 46 procedure (EMEA/H/C/000701/P46/064). 
Conclusions  
Issue resolved. 
Question 8 
The  RMP  should  be  updated  within  60  days  of  finalisation  of  the  article  46  process  to  state  that  the 
2-year results have been submitted. 
MAH response  
The MAH agrees to submit an updated RMP to reflect that the 2-year results for Study IM101301 have 
been submitted. The updated RMP will be part of the type II variation to be submitted within 60 days 
after completion of this Article 46 procedure (EMEA/H/C/000701/P46/064). 
Assessment MAH response  
The MAH has, as requested, agreed to update the RMP within 60 days of finalisation of the article 46 
procedure, to state that the 2-year results have been submitted.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
The MAH proposed the following indication: 
LIBTAYO as monotherapy is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) expressing PD-L1 (in ≥ 50% tumour cells), with no EGFR, ALK or ROS1 
aberrations, who have: 
• locally advanced NSCLC and who are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive 
chemoradiation, or have progressed after treatment with definitive chemoradiation, or 
• metastatic NSCLC. 
Epidemiology  
Lung cancer is the main cause of malignancy-related mortality worldwide (Bray F et al. CA Cancer J 
Clin. 2018), accounting for 1.80 million of deaths globally per year as estimated by the World Health 
Organization (WHO) (GLOBOCAN 2020). NSCLC accounts for 80% to 85% of all lung cancers and is 
composed of several histopathological subtypes, the most common of which are adenocarcinoma (40% 
to 60%) and squamous cell carcinoma (approximately 30%) (Principles and Practice of Oncology. 9th 
Edition. 2011). 
Biologic features, Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Historically, NSCLC has been considered a non-immunogenic disease (Brahmer 2013). However, 
emerging evidence has demonstrated that the lack of an effective immune response is, in fact, often 
the result of specific, active immune-evasive mechanisms. These mechanisms, if understood, can be 
overcome therapeutically with meaningful clinical efficacy (Carbone et al 2016). The most significant 
advances in NSCLC immunotherapy have been made in metastatic setting by targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 
immune checkpoint (Shu and Rizvi 2016). The PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors shift the balance of 
immune activity from a tumour-induced immune suppressive state toward an active antitumor immune 
response. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis 
At the time of first diagnosis, the majority of patients with NSCLC are found to have advanced disease 
that is not amenable to surgery with curative intent or that has spread to distant organs outside the 
thorax (American Cancer Society, 2020). 
Histological diagnosis of NSCLC is crucial to many treatment decisions and should be as exact and 
detailed as the samples and available technology allow. 
Assessment report  
EMA/319413/2021 
Page 8/100 
 
 
 
 
Despite optimal treatment, patients have a median overall survival (OS) of approximately 8 to 12 
months, and a 5-year survival rate of approximately 18% (Siegel, 2016). 
Management 
The majority of patients diagnosed with NSCLC are unsuitable for curative treatment. Systemic therapy 
with platinum-based doublet regimens, with or without maintenance therapy was until recently the 
standard first-line treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors do 
not have an EGFR mutation, an ALK mutation, or a ROS1 fusion (Besse, 2014) (Ettinger, 2016) (Reck, 
2014).  
Over the past decade, however, substantial progress has been made in the field of immuno-oncology, 
a treatment approach based on inducing host anti-tumor immune responses that lead to clinical 
responses. Agents that block the immunosuppressive PD-1/PD-L1 axis (often called “immune 
checkpoint blockade”), have collectively demonstrated clinical activity in numerous solid tumor 
indications, including NSCLC.  
The phase III KEYNOTE-024 study has established the role for pembrolizumab as first-line treatment in 
patients with untreated, advanced NSCLC and tumour characterised by PD-L1 expression ≥ 50%, in 
absence of EGFR mutation or ALK translocations. In KEYNOTE-024, 1934 patients were screened to 
identify 500 patients (30%) with tumour PD-L1 expression ≥ 50%. Of these patients, 305 patients were 
randomised to receive 200 mg pembrolizumab every 3 weeks (up to 2 years) or 4–6 cycles of standard 
platinum-doublet ChT. All efficacy measures favoured pembrolizumab, including objective response 
rate (ORR 45% versus 28%), progression-free survival (HR 0.5, 95% CI 0.37–0.68, p<0.001)] and 
overall survival (HR 0.6, 95% CI 0.41–0.89, p=0.005) (Reck, 2016). According to the ESMO 2020 
guidelines, pembrolizumab is considered a standard first-line option for patients with advanced NSCLC 
and PD-L1 expression ≥ 50% who do not otherwise have contraindications to use of immunotherapy 
(such as severe autoimmune disease or organ transplantation). 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Cemiplimab (LIBTAYO) is a recombinant human immunoglobulin G (IgG) 4 monoclonal antibody that 
binds to programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and blocks its interaction with programmed death-ligand 1 
(PD-L1) and programmed death-ligand 2 (PD-L2), countering PD-1-mediated inhibition of the immune 
response, including the anti-tumor immune response.  
In June 2019, the EMA granted cemiplimab a conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) for the 
treatment of adult patients with metastatic or locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma 
(mCSCC or laCSCC) who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation.  
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The current type II variation application is primarily based on the pivotal Study 1624 in NSCLC. The 
design aspects of the study were first presented to the CHMP in a SA procedure in November 2016, 
when the study was still at the planning stage. In January 2019, the MAH’s plans for potential changes 
in the nature of endpoints and planned statistical analyses were discussed in a follow-up procedure. 
Pertinent items within the procedure include: 
•  Elevation of OS from a key secondary to a co-primary endpoint was accepted by CHMP. 
Assessment report  
EMA/319413/2021 
Page 9/100 
 
 
 
 
•  As the protocol had been amended to allow patients in the cemiplimab arm to receive 
chemotherapy in combination with cemiplimab at the time of progression, the CHMP advised that 
due consideration should be given to the potential confounding effect of the post-study treatments 
on OS. Therefore, when such a strategy is pursued, the Applicant is strongly recommended to 
carefully collect data after progression during the study, including PFS2. Moreover, adequate 
measures according to available guidelines should be implemented/pre-planned in order to capture 
potential impact of the crossover/post study therapies on the OS results. In particular, the 
activity/benefit of continuation of a checkpoint inhibitor (in this case cemiplimab) after progression 
with addition of chemotherapy hasn’t been previously tested, but a potential confounding effect on 
OS (with potential inflation of the OS effect) cannot be excluded. 
•  Regarding the proposed testing analysis of the PFS and OS endpoints, the CHMP emphasised that in 
case OS and PFS are tested as co-primary endpoints, both endpoints would be required to be 
significant at the required alpha level. In the situation where the alpha is split, the study could be 
considered successful if either one of the two endpoints reaches significance. This is not the 
preferred approach for CHMP. Alternatively, a hierarchical testing strategy (similar to the strategy 
proposed for the add-on setting, first OS then PFS) could be considered acceptable. 
•  The proposed interim analysis for OS at the time of the final PFS analysis was acceptable to CHMP. 
However, a more detailed revised protocol would be needed for the CHMP to provide more specific 
advice on this aspect. The MAH was advised to ensure that a sufficient number of events have been 
observed at the time of the analysis to allow adequate evaluation of the treatment benefits. 
•  The non-proportional hazard of the study was discussed with the MAH as well as the inadequacy of 
conducting a log-rank test as primary analysis. Even though, in contrast to the Cox-proportional 
hazard model, the log-rank test is often incorrectly considered to make no assumption on the 
hazard it is not correct to assume that it will not be affected by the presence of a violation of that 
assumption. The MAH was invited to consider additional analyses that would allow the assessment 
of the impact of the violation of the proportionality assumption. Several methods have been 
described in the literature, with landmark analyses and restricted mean being the most often 
considered, but given the focus on this problem, an increasing number of additional methods are 
developed. According to CHMP, the MAH should consider pre-planning for such analyses, but is 
advised to explore all available options to address the needs of this specific setting. In addition, the 
MAH should provide analyses to explore whether the assumption is actually violated or not. 
Some CHMP recommendations have not been followed within the submission, and the MAH has 
provided the following justifications: 
•  The MAH deemed collection of PFS2 data as not feasible as many patients would be moving to other 
studies where their data would no longer be available. Furthermore, the changed focus to OS in the 
MAH’s opinion made the addition of PFS2 to substantiate a PFS advantage less relevant. 
•  According to the MAH, both alpha split and alpha reallocation are valid statistical methods to control 
overall type I error rate. The MAH chose to split alpha between OS and PFS to allow opportunity to 
test OS and PFS independently. 
•  According to the MAH, log-rank test is a nonparametric test which is valid with or without the 
existence of non-proportional hazard. The MAH increased study sample size to accommodate the 
loss of study power if non-proportional hazard exists in the study. Given that most of sensitivity 
analyses dealing with non-proportional hazard may inflate treatment effect, the MAH determined no 
additional sensitivity analysis is needed for this study. 
Subsequent to the follow-up procedure, the MAH implemented further significant changes in its 
statistical analytical approach, including a substantial change in the interim analysis strategy

(discussed in further detail in section “Clinical efficacy”). This change and thus the final study design 
(per Protocol Amendment 8) was not the subject of a SA procedure. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
No GCP inspections have occurred to the date of submission of the Marketing Authorisation Application 
(MAA). No critical audit findings were observed for Study R2810-ONC-1624. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Cemiplimab is an IgG4 monoclonal antibody consisting of linked naturally occurring amino acids being 
extensively degraded in the patient’s body by regular proteolytic mechanisms before excretion, 
cemiplimab is unlikely to result in a significant environmental exposure. Cemiplimab is expected to 
biodegrade in the environment and does not pose a significant risk to the environment. Thus, 
according to the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human 
Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), cemiplimab is exempt from the submission of Environmental Risk 
Assessment studies as the product and excipients do not pose a significant risk to the environment. 
2.2.2.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
Cemiplimab is a protein composed of natural amino acids. Proteins are biodegradable in the 
environment and thus do not pose any environmental risk. Therefore, according to the “Guideline on 
the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 
corr 2), it is acceptable that no ERA studies were submitted for cemiplimab.  
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of cemiplimab.  
Considering the above data, cemiplimab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction

Table 1. List of clinical studies in patients with solid tumours, including NSCLC, where 
pharmacokinetics and anti-drug antibodies were collected 
The pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and immunogenicity of cemiplimab were assessed in four 
clinical studies: 1) the completed FIH Study 1423 conducted in adult patients with various types of 
advanced solid tumours, including patients with NSCLC, treated with cemiplimab as monotherapy or in 
combination therapy, with dense sampling for pharmacokinetics (PK) and anti-drug antibody (ADA) 
assessment; 2) two ongoing pivotal phase 2 studies with cemiplimab monotherapy in adult patients 
with skin cancer: Study R2810-ONC-1540 (referred to as Study 1540) in patients with advanced CSCC 
and Study R2810-ONC-1620 (referred to as Study 1620) in patients with advanced basal cell 
carcinoma (BCC); and 3) one ongoing pivotal phase 3 monotherapy study in adult patients with 
advanced NSCLC: R2810-ONC-1624 (Study 1624) in patients with stage IIIB, IIIC, or stage IV 
squamous or non-squamous NSCLC, whose tumours express ≥50% PD-L1.

Page 12/100 
 
 
 
 
 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Bioanalytical methods 
For all four studies, serum samples for quantitation of functional cemiplimab were analysed using a 
validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with a lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of 78 ng/mL 
cemiplimab in neat serum. 
The validated method for detecting ADA is a non-quantitative, titer-based, electrochemiluminescent 
bridging immunoassay for screening, confirmation and titer determination. The ADA method was 
amended with established long-term stability of 12 months for the positive control. The method 
determined a drug tolerance of 415 µg/mL cemiplimab at a sensitivity of 100 ng/mL ADA positive 
control, which is adequate to cover the Cmin drug contents anticipated at steady-state in NSCLC 
patients (about 60 µg/mL at 350 mg (once every 3 weeks (Q3W)). However, in the bioanalytical 
reports, the drug tolerance limit is given as 734 µg/mL cemiplimab at a sensitivity of 500 ng/mL ADA 
positive control. The determined drug tolerance seems adequate and should be given at the 100 ng/mL 
sensitivity level. Cut-off points in the immunogenicity assay were determined using baseline samples 
from Study 1423, which also included NSCLC patients.  
The NAb method is an electrochemiluminescence-based competitive ligand binding assay. The drug 
tolerance level of the NAb method is 330 ng/mL cemiplimab with a sensitivity of 500 ng/mL NAb 
positive control, which is not adequate to cover the anticipated drug levels in the samples.  
In general, the number of failed plates were low indicating the conducted bioanalyses were robust. 
In Study 1624 (NSCLC), 240 out of 3671 samples analysed were tested for incurred sample reanalysis 
(ISR) with a 98.8% pass-rate. 634 samples were evaluated ADA and 17 confirmed ADA+ samples were 
tested for NAbs. All tested negative. In Study 1620 (BCC), 1783 samples were analysed while 638 
samples were evaluated for ADA. ISR was conducted on 148 samples with a pass rate of 100%. In 
Study 1423, 10540 samples were analysed in total, while 1151 samples were evaluated for ADA. ISR 
was conducted of 579 samples with a pass rate of 91%. In Study 1540, 2708 samples were analysed 
(data cut-off 20 Sep 2018), 262 samples were evaluated for ADA and ISR was conducted of 199 
samples (7%) with a 75% pass-rate. 
All samples for determination of cemiplimab concentration were stored at -80°C prior to analysis and 
analysed within 24 months of collection within the established 24-month long-term storage stability. 
Population PK analyses  
The final Pop PK model for cemiplimab in patients with solid tumours was based on a model developed 
for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). The initial model was updated with data from Studies 
1423, 1540, 1620 and 1624 in patients with basal cell carcinoma (BCC), CSCC, NSCLC and other solid 
tumours who received cemiplimab 350 mg Q3W. The Pop PK population contained 17193 data points 
from 1062 patients (Table 2).

Table 2. Summary of Population and PK samples included in the Pop PK in analysis dataset 
The final structural model (BASE006) was a two-compartment model with zero-order IV infusion, linear 
elimination with a time-dependent clearance (sigmoid Emax function with fixed Hill factor), time-varying 
albumin and effect of baseline body weight allometric scaled with fixed exponents of 0.75 (CL) and 1.0 
(V). The final covariate model included four covariates: weight, albumin, immunoglobulin G (IgG) (only 
applicable to studies 1423 and 1540) and disease type (NSCLC relative to CSCC) on the elimination 
clearance CL.  
Compared to the previous model, the following covariate changes are present: Previously, “Black” race 
was a predictor of delay of clearance change (T50), indicating a slower decrease in clearance than what 
is observed for other ethnicities. This covariate relationship is no longer present. Also, the covariate 
effect of alanine aminotransferase on clearance has disappeared. A new covariate effect to describe 
association between NSCLC and clearance is included. The covariate effect of albumin on clearance is 
essentially unchanged, and so is the effect of IgG on clearance. Regarding size, body weight was 
previously included as an empirical covariate, and clearance was proportional to weight to the power of 
0.45. Steady-state volume of distribution (Vd) was previously proportional to weight to the power of 
0.935 and proportional to body-mass index (BMI) to the power of -0.553. In the current model, fixed 
allometry has been used to set the clearance proportional to weight to the power of 0.75, and Vd 
proportional to weight to the power of 1.0.  Plots of Empirical Bayes Estimates versus covariates from 
the final population PK model reveal a slight trend of decreasing random effect values versus weight 
for both clearance and steady-state volume of distribution, however the magnitude of the trend is 
small compared to the extent of overall inter-individual variability. The fixed allometric exponents are 
considered to sufficiently capture the cemiplimab weight-PK covariate relationships. No other 
significant trends could be observed in plots of Empirical Bayes Estimates versus covariates. 
The final model was evaluated by Bootstrap analysis, goodness of fit (GoF) plots and visual predictive 
checks (VPCs). All diagnostic plots and VPCs indicated the PK model could describe the PK of 
cemiplimab. The final parameters were estimated with adequate precision (%RSE). Nonparametric 
bootstrap was performed on 500 replicate datasets and resulted in 95% CIs for population PK 
parameter estimates. The bootstrap estimates matched well to the final parameter estimates and none 
of the 95% CI contained the null (Table 3).  
Inter-individual variability was included for the parameters describing the T50 and the maximal extent 
of clearance change (Emax). This is appropriate to ensure that a unique time-varying clearance profile 
Assessment report

Page 14/100 
 
 
 
 
 
is estimated for each subject, and the resulting individual exposure parameters are informative for the 
exposure-response analyses. 
Eta shrinkage ranged from 18.5 to 30.4%. The shrinkage was high for Emax and T50, hence the 
information for these effects are limited. The conditional number was <10, indicating that the model 
was not over-parameterised. Less than half of the 500 bootstrap runs (238 (~47.6%)) converged, 
which might indicate lack of robustness in the model structure. The CV% of population PK parameter 
estimates from the final model ranged from 49%-97.5% with the non-linear clearance parameters 
Emax and T50 having the highest CV% of 63.3% and 97.5%. These parameters were also the main 
reason for the large proportion of failed bootstrap runs due to inadequate data to describe the time-
dependent clearance. 
Clearance decreased over time of treatment with cemiplimab. The change in clearance is larger in 
patients who were considered responders to cemiplimab (35.3% decrease).  
Table 3. Summary of parameter values after modelling with analysis dataset or bootstrap 
datasets for the final model 
It is noted that at steady state, the NSCLC population have marked increased CL, shorter half-life and 
thus lower exposure, in non-responders (“all others”) compared to responders. This is not seen to the 
same extent for the other solid tumour types (Figure 1).

The Pop PK model for cemiplimab was refined which improved robustness and gave a better fit for 
NSCLC patients. The model structure was maintained. Estimation of inter-individual variability on Emax 
and T50 were removed, the proportional error model was changed to a log-additive error model and the 
off-diagonal covariance between inter-individual random effects on CLQ and VSS was also removed. A 
covariate effect of NSCLC on T50 was included which improved the model notably. The original model 
was not stable. Model stability of the updated model was evaluated using bootstrap (n=500) and all 
runs converged successfully. The provided GoF plots and pc-VPCs indicated the model could adequately 
describe the observed concentrations of cemiplimab in non-NSCLC and NSCLC patients.  
A sensitivity analysis of outliers defined as |CWRES|>5 or |IWRES|>5 (n=85) indicated 
inclusion/exclusion of these observations did not have relevant impact on the parameter estimates. 
Simulation of exposure metrics  
The final population PK model was used to generate post-hoc estimates of individual PK parameters 
and simulate exposure metrics for each subject in the analysis population. Descriptive statistics of 
summary exposure metrics were presented after the first dose and at steady-state stratified for dose 
or solid tumour type and responder/all others (data not shown). 
Absorption 
Cemiplimab was administered intravenous (IV) as a 30-minute infusion and peak concentrations 
(Cmax) are typically reached at the end of infusion.  
Similar absorption and distribution profiles after the first dose were noted in patients with advanced 
NSCLC and in all patients with solid tumours (Table 4).  
Assessment report  
EMA/319413/2021

Table 4. Cemiplimab exposure (Ctrough and Cmax) after the first dose and at steady state in 
patients with CSCC, in patients with BCC, in patients with NSCLC, in all patients receiving 
350 mg Q3W and in all patients receiving 3 mg/kg Q2W on cemiplimab monotherapy 
In the first-in-human study 1423, rich PK sampling occurred after the first dose, allowing to assess 
Tmax, while in the pivotal phase 2/3 Studies 1540, 1620 and 1624, sparse PK sample collection was 
applied at pre-dose and end-of-infusion during treatment and at selected time points during follow up. 
Except for Study 1423, where Cmax could be estimated, concentrations at the end-of-infusion were 
referred to as ‘Cmax’. While maximal cemiplimab concentrations are expected to be reached at the end 
of the 30-minute IV infusion, as anticipated for a monoclonal antibody with a slow clearance, very 
similar concentrations within the bioanalytical range of variability are observed at 1-hour and 
occasionally at 4-hours post-end-of-infusion. As a result, the median value for Tmax in the FIH Study 
1423 is reported as 0.5 hours, with a range of 0.033 hours to 4.0 hours.  
Population predicted Ctrough and Cmax values in the overall PopPK population of 1062 patients at 350 
mg Q3W are presented in Table 5. These data indicate that cemiplimab exposure in the overall PopPK 
population of patients with solid tumours is similar to that observed in patients with advanced NSCLC 
and that the population model predicted values in the overall population of patients with solid tumours 
are representative of patients with advanced NSCLC in the pivotal Study 1624.

Distribution 
As is typical for monoclonal antibodies, cemiplimab is primarily distributed in the vascular system.  
Based on PopPK analysis, the total volume of distribution at steady state is 5.3 L (Table 6). 
Elimination 
Specific metabolism studies were not conducted because cemiplimab is a protein. Cemiplimab is 
expected to be degraded into small peptides and individual amino acids. Additionally, given their 
molecular weight and hydrodynamic size, mAbs are also not subject to renal elimination.  
The clearance of cemiplimab is independent of dose for the regimens studied (1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg 
Q2W) and linear elimination was confirmed by PopPK analysis. Descriptive statistics for individual 
cemiplimab PK parameters in PopPK patient population are summarized in (Table 6).  
Table 6. Descriptive statistics for individual cemiplimab PK parameters in PopPK patient 
population with solid tumours estimated using the final PK population model 
The time-dependent decrease in clearance in clearance for “responders” versus “all other” patients 
with BCC appears to be similar (Figure 2).

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Linearity and dose proportionality of cemiplimab exposure was observed over a dose range of 1 mg/kg 
to 10 mg/kg Q2W in the FIH Study 1423, including both monotherapy and combination therapy, and 
different solid tumour types. This was further confirmed by PopPK analysis using integrated data of the 
overall PopPK population (1062 patients) of the four studies combined. In patients with advanced 
NSCLC treated with cemiplimab at 350 mg Q3W, systemic concentrations of cemiplimab were identified 
by PopPK analysis to reside within the linear dose-proportional range.  
Cemiplimab exposure in patients with solid tumours reach steady state by 4 months (16 weeks) of 
cemiplimab dosing (>90% of plateau) (Figure 3). The accumulation index upon Q3W dosing is 2.2, 
indicating an accumulation upon repeated dosing of approximately 2-fold.

Special populations 
In the PopPK analysis, the main identified intrinsic sources of PK variability were body weight, as well 
as baseline albumin and baseline IgG concentrations. No other tested covariates, including 
demographics (e.g., age) and baseline PD-L1 expression, had a statistically significant effect on 
cemiplimab exposure. The effect of all covariates combined on the post-hoc estimations of exposure 
(Cmax, Cmin, and AUC) was relatively small (<25%), and within the typical PK variability observed of 
Assessment report  
EMA/319413/2021 
Page 19/100 
 
 
 
 
 
approximately 30%. While tumour type (NSCLC) was found as one of the statistically significant 
covariates, the resulting exposure across tumour types including advanced CSCC, advanced BCC, and 
advanced NSCLC was comparable (differences <10%). 
Consistent with other monoclonal antibodies, cemiplimab is not subject to elimination through the renal 
or hepatic pathways; no specific studies for renal or hepatic impairment were conducted. The impact of 
renal and hepatic impairment on cemiplimab PK was assessed through PopPK analysis. No difference in 
cemiplimab exposure due to mild to severe renal impairment or mild to moderate hepatic impairment 
was identified.

Body Weight 
Typical of monoclonal antibodies and other large protein therapeutic agents for which the central 
compartment largely comprises the systemic volume, drug exposure is correlated with body weight 
and body mass index (BMI). Consistent with these findings, the PopPK analysis in the overall patient 
population with a mean body weight of 75.8 kg and ranging from 30.9 kg to 172 kg showed a modest 
decrease in cemiplimab exposure with increasing body weight with this fixed dosing regimen. 
Given the small variation in Cmin due to body weight, systemic concentrations of cemiplimab remain 
sufficient to maintain linear kinetics over the dosing interval. 
Age 
In the overall population of patients with solid tumours, age was 65 years on average and ranged from 
27 to 96 years. Age did not affect the PK of cemiplimab in the overall Pop PK population of patients 
with solid tumours; the same applies to the patients with advanced NSCLC. 
Sex 
The complete patient population with solid tumours on cemiplimab treatment included 750 males and 
312 females. Sex was not identified as a statistically significant covariate of cemiplimab exposure. 
Race and Ethnicity 
Race and ethnicity were not identified as statistically significant covariates on CL. The population 
predicted estimates of cemiplimab exposure by race or ethnicity are comparable. 
Baseline Albumin Level 
Baseline albumin seemed directly correlated to exposure. The higher albumin the higher exposure 
(Figure 4). Albumin was shown to have a statistically significant effect on the clearance of cemiplimab. 
In patients with advanced NSCLC and in the overall patient population, lower albumin levels were 
associated with increased clearance of cemiplimab.

albumin for 350 mg Q3W

Baseline Immunoglobulin Level 
Baseline IgG levels did not have large effect on exposure (Figure 5). Boxplots of steady state exposure 
metrics AUC and Ctrough indicated a lower exposure for NSCLC patients in general compared to 
patients with BCC and CSCC. This is also evident from the simulated concentration-time profile for 
NSCLC vs. all other tumour types. However, in the current PopPK model, covariate analysis showed 
that IgG at baseline is a statistically significant covariate in that cemiplimab clearance was greater in 
patients with higher IgG levels. 
Baseline IgG levels were not collected in Study 1620 in patients with advanced BCC and in Study 1624 
in patients with advanced NSCLC. Thus, the effect of high IgG on cemiplimab efficacy cannot be 
assessed in patients with advanced NSCLC. However, clinical efficacy was observed in patients with 
advanced CSCC with extremely high baseline IgG levels. 
Figure 5. Boxplot of individual post-hoc estimates of AUC6wks,ss by quartiles of baseline IgG 
for 350 mg Q3W  
Tumour Type 
Boxplots of steady state exposure metrics AUC and Ctrough indicated a lower exposure for NSCLC 
patients in general compared to patients with BCC and CSCC (Figure 6, Figure 7). This is also evident 
from the simulated concentration-time profile for NSCLC vs. all other tumour types (figure not shown). 
Tumour type (NSCLC) was found to be a statistically significant covariate; exposures in patients with 
NSCLC were approximately 10% lower than in patients with CSCC or BCC at 350 mg Q3W, which is 
within the overall range of variability in exposure.

PD-L1 Expression 
By PopPK covariate analysis, PD-L1 expression at baseline was not identified as a statistical covariate 
of cemiplimab exposure. 
Responders versus All Others 
Post-hoc analysis of cemiplimab concentrations over time to week 63 with 350 mg Q3W dosing 
indicated that patients who responded to cemiplimab treatment tend to have a slightly higher exposure 
than all other patients. An observed higher exposure in the ‘responders’ is consistent with the 
Assessment report  
EMA/319413/2021

difference in baseline CL. This observation in the overall population is largely driven by the patients 
from the NSCLC population, as the exposure in the ‘responders’ versus ‘all others’ is quite similar in 
patients with advanced CSCC and advanced BCC, given the similarity in baseline CL in these two 
populations.  
Similar cemiplimab exposure across tumour types and within one tumour type, in ‘responders’ (1) 
compared to ‘all others’ (0), within the variability in exposure, was observed (Table 8). In addition, no 
difference in covariate levels were observed between 'responders' and 'all others'.

Q3W by tumour type, for ‘responders’ and ‘all others’ 
Baseline Performance Status 
Baseline ECOG status was not identified as a statistically significant covariate. 
Renal Impairment 
The effect of renal impairment on the exposure of cemiplimab was evaluated by a population PK 
analysis in patients with mild (CLcr 60 to 89 ml/min; n= 396), moderate (CLcr 30 to 59 ml/min; n= 
166), or severe (CLcr 15 to 29 ml/min; n= 7) renal impairment. 
Renal impairment is not expected to affect the PK of cemiplimab. Consistent with this, renal function 
was not identified as a significant covariate in the PopPK model. However, the individual predicted 
exposure at steady-state was observed to increase with increasing severity of renal impairment.  
Hepatic Impairment 
By PopPK covariate analysis, hepatic impairment was not identified as a statistically significant 
covariate. Additionally, no differences in the exposure of cemiplimab were found between patients with 
mild ((n= 22) (total bilirubin [TB] greater than 1.0 to 1.5 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] and 
any aspartate aminotransferase [AST])) or moderate ((n=3) (total bilirubin >1.5 times ULN up to 3.0 
times ULN) and any AST) hepatic impairment and patients with normal hepatic function. No patients 
with severe hepatic impairment were included.

Extrinsic Factors 
The magnitude of covariate effects on cemiplimab exposure and PK in the PopPK analysis model was 
used to assess the potential effect of extrinsic factors on cemiplimab exposure. Extrinsic covariates 
tested included treatment (monotherapy versus combination therapies with radiation and/or 
chemotherapy) and country (site, region).  
Treatment (Monotherapy versus Combination Therapy) 
There is no apparent difference (<25%) in cemiplimab exposure (AUCtau,ss or Ctrough,ss) in patients 
treated with cemiplimab as monotherapy compared with patients treated with cemiplimab in 
combination therapies, including radiotherapy and chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, carboplatin, 
docetaxel, paclitaxel, or GM-CSF. 
Country 
Overall, there was no apparent difference (<20%) in cemiplimab exposure (AUC6wk,ss or Ctrough,ss) 
across patients from the different countries where Studies 1423, 1540, 1620, and 1624 were 
conducted. 
Effect of ADAs on exposure 
In the overall Pop PK population (N=1062), 803 patients tested ADA negative, 18 patients were ADA-
positive and 241 were “NA”. In Study 1624, out of 221 NSCLC patients, 6 were pre-treatment ADA 
positive while 5 were post-treatment ADA positive. All 11 patients were NAb negative. A spaghetti plot 
of individual concentration profiles indicates that ADA status do not affect exposure.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Cemiplimab is not anticipated to interact directly or indirectly with cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes 
therefore no specific drug-drug interaction studies of cemiplimab with other drugs were conducted.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Median percent change in tumor size after cemiplimab or chemotherapy treatment was used as a 
pharmacodynamics marker in the mITT-1 population (N=563), as this comprises all patients with 
tumor PD-L1 expression ≥50% as determined using a test performed according to instructions for use 
(Figure 9).  The decrease in tumour size was more pronounced for higher levels of PD L1 expression, 
with the highest median percent of change observed in patients treated with cemiplimab who 
expressed PD-L1 ≥90%.

Abbreviations: IRC= independent review committee; mITT-1= intent-to-treat; LOCF= Last observation carried

<90%, ≥50% and ≤60%, and ≥50%; chemotherapy PD-L1 expression category: ≥50%). 
Mechanism of action 
Cemiplimab is a high affinity, fully human, hinge stabilized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) antibody 
directed to the PD-1 receptor that blocks the interaction of PD-1 with its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Exposure-Response Relationships 
Descriptive and model-based E-R relationship analyses were conducted for efficacy and safety 
endpoints using post-hoc estimates of exposure metrics (Cmax, Ctrough, and AUC) after the first dose 
and at steady state, with emphasis on Ctrough for efficacy endpoints and on Cmax for safety endpoints. 
In addition, the relationships between efficacy endpoints and clearance of cemiplimab at baseline and 
steady state were also investigated. 
Exposure-Response (E-R) analyses for efficacy were conducted on the primary efficacy endpoints OS 
and PFS, and also ORR (based on BOR). Analysis by the Cox proportional model indicated that the 
exposure metrics (after the first dose and at steady state), clearance of cemiplimab at baseline and 
steady state, and baseline PD-L1 were consistently significant predictors (Figure 10, Figure 11, Figure 
12), with clearance of cemiplimab being the most significant predictor of both PFS and OS.  
Univariate and multivariable models which included terms for the exposure metrics, indicated that 
baseline PD-L1 status has a significant effect on PFS and drug concentration.

No meaningful E-R relationships for safety variables (immune-related adverse event (imAEs) all grades 
and imAEs ≥ grade 3) were observed in patients with NSCLC on cemiplimab monotherapy in Study 
1624 (Pool 1), patients on cemiplimab monotherapy (Pool 2), or all patients receiving cemiplimab as

Immunogenicity 
The incidence of treatment-emergent ADA was 2.3% in all patients receiving cemiplimab 350 mg Q3W.  
Antibody titers were all low. Of the patients who developed treatment emergent antibodies to 
cemiplimab, none developed NAb. The incidence of persistent ADA was 0.4% in all patients receiving 
cemiplimab. The incidence of treatment-emergent ADA in patients with advanced NSCLC in Study 1624 
(2.3%) was consistent with the incidence observed across all studies. The presence of ADA was not 
associated with significant AEs or imAEs. 
Dose Selection 
In Study 1624, the selected dosing regimen of 350 mg Q3W IV in patients with advanced NSCLC was 
supported by preliminary efficacy data in the FIH Study 1423, the evolving efficacy data in the 
treatment of advanced CSCC (Study 1540), as well as the combined safety data in 1078 patients 
across the cemiplimab program. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The bioanalytical methods used to determine the concentration of functional cemiplimab and to assess 
immunogenicity in human serum samples are the same assays assessed in the original marketing 
authorisation application for CSCC.  
The pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and immunogenicity of cemiplimab were assessed in four 
clinical studies and were further analysed by Population PK/PD models. The drug tolerance level of the 
NAb method is 330 ng/mL cemiplimab with a sensitivity of 500 ng/mL NAb positive control, which is

Page 28/100 
 
 
 
 
 
 
not adequate to cover the anticipated drug levels in the samples. The Applicant is recommended to 
improve drug tolerance in the NAb assay. 
Consistent with the initial Pop PK assessments in support of the initial marketing authorisation 
application, the kinetics of cemiplimab in the overall population could be described by a two-
compartment model with a time-varying component on clearance and of baseline albumin. Less than 
half of 500 bootstrap runs converged. The main reason for the failed runs was inadequate data to 
describe the time-dependent clearance parameters Emax and T50. 
The Pop PK model was updated. Estimation of inter-individual variability on Emax and T50 were 
removed, the proportional error model was changed to a log-additive error model and the off-diagonal 
covariance between inter-individual random effects on CLQ and VSS was also removed. A covariate 
effect of NSCLC on T50 was included which improved the model notably. The updated model was 
evaluated using bootstrap (n=500) and all runs converged successfully. The provided GoF plots and 
pc-VPCs indicated the model could adequately describe the observed concentrations of cemiplimab in 
non-NSCLC and NSCLC patients. The fixed allometric exponents are considered to sufficiently capture 
the cemiplimab weight-PK covariate relationships. No other significant trends could be observed in 
plots of Empirical Bayes Estimates versus covariates. Exclusion of outlier concentrations did not change 
the population PK parameter estimates in a relevant manner. 
Concentration data from 1062 patients with various solid tumours who received cemiplimab were 
combined in a population PK analysis. At 350 mg Q3W, the mean cemiplimab concentrations at steady-
state ranged between a Ctrough of 61 mg/l and a concentration at end of infusion (Cmax) of 171 mg/l. 
Steady state exposure is achieved after approximately 4 months of treatment (see section 5.2 of the 
SmPC). 
Cemiplimab is administered via the intravenous route and hence is completely bioavailable. As is 
typical for monoclonal antibodies, Cemiplimab is primarily distributed in the vascular system with a 
volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) of 5.3 l. Median Tmax occurs at the end of the 30-minute 
infusion. Specific metabolism studies were not conducted because cemiplimab is a protein. Cemiplimab 
is expected to degrade to small peptides and individual amino acids (see section 5.2 of the SmPC). 
At the dosing regimens of 1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg every two weeks, pharmacokinetics of cemiplimab 
were linear and dose proportional, suggesting saturation of the systemic target mediated pathway (see 
section 5.2 of the SmPC). Cemiplimab clearance after the first dose is approximately 0.29 l/day. The 
total clearance appears to decrease by approximately 29% over time, resulting in a steady state 
clearance (CLss) of 0.20 l/day. However, the decrease in CL is not considered clinically relevant. The 
within dosing interval half-life at steady state is 20.3 days (see section 5.2 of the SmPC). 
The time-varying change in clearance is accounted for by a sigmoid-Emax function with a fixed Hill 
factor in the population PK model. The hypothesis that cachexia is the cause of time-varying clearance 
of cemiplimab would be supported by the result that albumin was able to explain some, but not all of 
the trends in clearance. If cachexia causes the degradation rates of albumin and cemiplimab to be 
proportional to each other at any given time, then it follows that current albumin concentrations are a 
“delayed” biomarker of cachexia, as it takes some time for a new albumin concentration equilibrium to 
be reached after a change in clearance.  
A difference in time dependent decrease for responders vs. all others patients in patients with BCC and 
NSCLC was observed. However, due to  relatively wide confidence intervals in baseline clearance and 
change in clearance over time in addition to the considerable overlap between ‘responders and ‘all 
others’ across tumour types, further interpretation and conclusions cannot be made at the individual 
level to predict clinical effect based on cemiplimab clearance. 
Assessment report  
EMA/319413/2021 
Page 29/100 
 
 
 
 
Cemiplimab exposure in patients with solid tumours reach steady-state by 4 months (16 weeks) of 
cemiplimab dosing. The accumulation index upon Q3W dosing is 2.2, indicating an accumulation upon 
repeated dosing of approximately 2-fold. 
The significant covariates identified in the Pop PK population were body weight, albumin, baseline IgG 
(only applicable to studies 1423 and 1540), and tumour type. 
Baseline albumin seemed directly correlated to exposure. The association between low albumin and 
increased clearance for a monoclonal antibody is well known, and may be related to the altered 
neonatal fragment crystallizable receptor-mediated recirculation of monoclonal antibodies or the fact 
that the elimination or turnover of proteins including mAbs and albumin is higher in cachectic patients. 
The magnitude of increasing/decreasing exposure (25%) associated with high/low albumin levels is 
within the typical variability in exposure in the patient population at 350 mg Q3W. In light of the 
sparse data, it is agreed that in the absence of a noticeable effect of low baseline albumin levels on 
cemiplimab exposure and efficacy, no changes to the SmPC are needed. Also, it is acknowledged that 
the observed levels of exposure remained within the variability in exposure in the overall PopPK 
population of 1062 patients. 
Tumour type (NSCLC) was found to be a statistically significant covariate; exposures in patients with 
NSCLC were approximately 10% lower than in patients with CSCC or BCC at 350 mg Q3W, which is 
within the overall range of variability in exposure. Furthermore, the lower (-<10%) cemiplimab 
exposure in patients with advanced NSCLC compared to patients with advanced CSCC or advanced 
BCC is possibly related to their slightly higher baseline clearance. 
A population PK analysis suggests that the following factors have no clinically significant effect on the 
exposure of cemiplimab: age, gender, body weight, race, cancer type, albumin level, renal impairment, 
and mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see section 5.2 of the SmPC).  
Renal function was not identified as a significant covariate in the PopPK model. However, the individual 
predicted exposure at steady-state was observed to increase with increasing severity of renal 
impairment. It was noted that patients with severe renal impairment have lower body weights and 
thus higher exposure of cemiplimab. 
No clinically important differences in the exposure of cemiplimab were found between patients with 
renal impairment and patients with normal renal function. Cemiplimab has not been studied in patients 
with CLcr <21 ml/min. No clinically important differences in the exposure of cemiplimab were found 
compared to patients with normal hepatic function. Cemiplimab has not been studied in patients with 
severe hepatic impairment. There are insufficient data in patients with severe hepatic impairment for 
dosing recommendations (see section 5.2 of the SmPC). 
Cemiplimab is not anticipated to interact directly or indirectly with cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes 
therefore no specific drug-drug interaction studies of cemiplimab with other drugs were conducted. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The decrease in tumour size was more pronounced for higher levels of PD-L1 expression, with the 
highest median percent of change observed in patients treated with cemiplimab who expressed PD-L1 
≥90%. The MAH is conducting a phase 3 clinical trial (R2810-ONC-16113, EudraCT Number: 2017-
001311-36) of cemiplimab in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy in which patients with 
PD-L1 expression of <50% are eligible. 
There was evidence of an E-R relationship across all efficacy endpoints (ORR/BOR, DOR, and for the 
primary endpoints OS and PFS), with exposure metrics (after the first dose and at steady state) in 
patients with advanced NSCLC treated with 350 mg Q3W.  
Assessment report  
EMA/319413/2021 
Page 30/100 
 
 
 
 
Clearance of cemiplimab at baseline and steady state and baseline PD-L1 were consistently significant 
predictors of PFS. Since CL is a strong covariate of exposure, it is a confounding factor in the 
interpretation of the E-R relationship. The differences in CL between ‘responders’ and ‘non-responders’ 
leading to this apparent E-R relationship likely reflect other patient characteristics that affect the 
tumour response to cemiplimab.  
There are no clinically meaningful relationships between cemiplimab exposure (Cmax, Ctrough, and 
AUC) and imAEs in patients with advanced NSCLC and in the overall population of patients with solid 
tumours.  
Cemiplimab has low immunogenicity potential. The incidence of anti cemiplimab antibodies in patients 
with advanced NSCLC (2.3%) treated with cemiplimab 350 mg Q3W is low. Of the patients who 
developed treatment-emergent antibodies to cemiplimab, none developed NAbs. There was no effect of 
anti-cemiplimab antibodies on the PK of cemiplimab.  
The proposed posology 350 mg Q3W in Study 1540 is based on the initial MAA approval in advanced 
CSCC. Cemiplimab demonstrated comparable PK properties in patients with CSCC and NSCLC. 
Furthermore, the 350 mg Q3W dose was intentionally selected to saturate the target mediated 
pathway over the dosing interval, leading to the observed linear PK. Having saturated the target 
mediated pathway and at concentrations sufficient to account for inter-patient variability in exposure, 
changes in drug concentrations are not expected to lead to any further pharmacological effect from the 
perspective of safety or efficacy. The selected dosing strategy is accepted. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the clinical pharmacology of cemiplimab has been adequately described for patients with 
NSCLC. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
No additional dose-response study was performed (see Section 2.3.3. Pharmacodynamics and 
discussion on clinical pharmacology). A fixed dose of cemiplimab 350 mg Q3W (same regimen 
authorised for CSCC) was used in Study 1624. 
2.4.2.  Main study – Study 1624 
Study 1624 is a randomised, multicentre, global, open-label, pivotal phase 3 study of cemiplimab 
monotherapy versus platinum-based doublet chemotherapy in patients with stage IIIB, stage IIIC, or 
stage IV squamous or non-squamous NSCLC who were not candidates for treatment with definitive 
chemoradiotherapy, whose tumours expressed PD-L1 in ≥50% of tumour cells, with no EGFR, ALK, or 
ROS1 aberrations, and who had received no prior systemic treatment for their advanced disease. 
The study design is summarised in Figure 13. Eligible patients were randomised equally to either 
cemiplimab monotherapy or platinum-based doublet chemotherapy. Randomisation was stratified by 
histology (squamous versus non-squamous) and geographic region (Europe, Asia, or rest of the world 
(ROW)).  
Patients assigned to the cemiplimab arm received cemiplimab on day 1 of every treatment cycle (Q3W) 
for up to 108 weeks or until Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) 
Assessment report

defined progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, death, or withdrawal of consent. Patients assigned 
to the chemotherapy arm received a platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (with or without 
maintenance therapy) for four to six cycles and according to the local prescribing information and 
practice guidelines, or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or withdrawal of 
consent. 
The first radiographic tumour assessment occurred after nine weeks of study treatment and was 
repeated every nine weeks thereafter. To decrease bias in the assessment of disease progression in 
the open-label study, an Independent Review Committee (IRC) that is blinded to treatment assignment 
was used to adjudicate tumour responses. 
The study will end when the survival analysis is complete; according to the study protocol, 476 deaths 
were expected at final analysis of OS. The last patient last visit will be 48 months from the enrolment of 
the last patient. The duration of the study for each patient is approximately 48 months.

Treatments 
Cemiplimab  
The dose level of cemiplimab in Study 1624 was 350 mg administered by IV infusion every 3 weeks 
(Q3W) for up to total of 108 weeks or until progression, unacceptable toxicity, death or withdrawal of 
consent. 
As of protocol amendment 6 (22-AUG-2018), patients randomized to receive cemiplimab 350 mg who 
experience RECIST 1.1-defined progression during cemiplimab monotherapy were given the option to 
continue cemiplimab treatment with the addition of four cycles of histology-specific platinum-based 
doublet chemotherapy until further progression is observed, provided, the patient has not completed 
the 108-week treatment period and protocol-specified criteria were met.  
Chemotherapy 
Platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (with or without maintenance therapy), administered for four to 
six cycles as outlined in Table 10 and according to the local prescribing information and practice 
guidelines, or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or withdrawal of consent. The 
investigators were permitted to choose from several alternatives; these regimens were consistent with 
Assessment report  
EMA/319413/2021 
Page 35/100 
 
 
 
 
clinical treatment guidelines for chemotherapy options in NSCLC at the time the trial was designed 
(Table 10). 
Table 10. Guidelines for platinum-based doublet chemotherapy regimens 
Cross-over 
Patients who experience disease progression while on, or after completion of chemotherapy were 
offered the option to crossover to cemiplimab at the time of IRC confirmed progression to receive 
cemiplimab 350 mg Q3W for up to 108 weeks, provided they met the following criteria: 
• 
• 
• 
IRC confirms investigator assessment of disease progression 
Investigator assesses use of a PD-1 inhibitor as an appropriate second-line treatment 
Patient continues to meet all other study eligibility criteria, as defined in the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria 
Within Interim Analysis 2 that was conducted per Protocol Amendment 8 (database lock [DBL] date: 
14 Apr 2020) and defined to be conducted when approximately 50% of expected OS events are 
observed, the primary endpoint of OS was reached. Subsequent to this, Protocol Amendment 9 was 
implemented to allow patients randomised to chemotherapy to crossover with cemiplimab for up to 
108 weeks. Patients eligible to crossover to cemiplimab included the following: 
•   Patients who were actively being treated with chemotherapy 
•   Patients who had completed chemotherapy and were in the follow-up phase, but whose disease 
had not yet progressed 
•   Patients who had discontinued chemotherapy and had progressed, but had not yet crossed over 
to cemiplimab for any reason and had not started any other systemic therapy 
Dose modifications 
Dose modifications of cemiplimab are not permitted per protocol. Dose modification/reduction or 
temporary cessation of a given chemotherapy was to be managed in accordance with regional 
standard-of-care and guidelines.

Objectives 
According to the Protocol dated 23 Oct 2019 (Protocol Amendment 8), the objectives of the study 
were: 
Primary Objective: 
•  To compare the overall survival (OS) of cemiplimab versus platinum-based doublet chemotherapies 
in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose tumours express PD-
L1 in ≥50% of tumour cells 
•  To  compare  the  progression-free  survival  (PFS)  of  cemiplimab  versus  platinum-based  doublet 
chemotherapies  in  the  first-line  treatment  of  patients  with  advanced  or  metastatic  NSCLC  whose 
tumours express PD-L1 in ≥50% of tumour cells 
Key Secondary Objectives: 
•  To compare the objective response rate (ORR) of cemiplimab versus platinum-based chemotherapies 
Secondary Objectives: 
•  To compare the duration of response (DOR) of cemiplimab versus platinum-based chemotherapies 
•  To  assess  the  quality  of  life  (QoL)  of  patients  treated  with  cemiplimab  versus  patients  receiving 
platinum-based  chemotherapies  as  measured  by  the  European  Organisation  for  Research  and 
Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQC30) and EORTC QLQ Lung 
Cancer 13 (LC13) 
•  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of cemiplimab versus platinum-based chemotherapies 
•  To measure concentrations of cemiplimab in serum and characterise the PK of cemiplimab 
•  To assess immunogenicity (anti-drug antibodies /neutralising antibodies [ADAs/NAbs]) to cemiplimab 
and any relationship with drug concentrations, efficacy, and safety 
•  To conduct exposure-response analyses on efficacy endpoints and safety 
Exploratory Objectives: 
•  To  assess  correlation  between  the  level  of  PD-L1  expression  at  baseline  and  efficacy  of  study 
treatment 
•  To assess time to new anti-tumour therapy 
•  To  assess  pharmacodynamic  (PD)  changes  in  putative  serum  biomarkers  (which  could  include  but 
were not limited to cytokines, circulating tumour nucleic acids, etc) 
•  To conduct PK/PD analyses on exploratory biomarkers, as appropriate 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoints 
•  OS, defined as the date from randomisation to the date of death. A patient who has not died was 
censored at the last known date of contact. 
•  PFS, defined as the time from randomisation to the date of the first documented tumour progression 
or death due to any cause. PFS was assessed by a blinded independent review committee (IRC) using 
Response  Evaluation  Criteria  in  Solid  Tumours  (RECIST)  version  1.1.  Patients  were  censored 
according to the following rules: 
o  Patients who did not have a documented tumour progression or death were censored on the date 
of their last evaluable tumour assessment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/319413/2021 
Page 37/100 
 
 
 
 
o  Patients who did not have a documented tumour progression or death before initiation of new 
anti-tumour therapy were censored on the date of their last evaluable tumour assessment prior 
to or on the date of new anti-tumour therapy. 
o  Patients who withdrew consent before taking any study treatment (therefore there was no post-
baseline tumour assessment) were censored on the date of randomisation. 
o  Patients who did not have any evaluable tumour assessments after randomisation and did not 
die were censored on the date of randomisation. 
Key secondary endpoint 
ORR was defined as the number of patients with a best overall response (BOR) of confirmed complete 
response (CR) or partial response (PR). The BOR is defined as the best response, as determined by the 
blinded IRC per RECIST 1.1, between the date of randomisation and the date of the first documented 
tumour progression or the date of subsequent anti-cancer therapy, whichever came first. 
Other secondary endpoints 
•  The DOR determined for patients with BOR of CR or PR. DOR is measured from the time measurement 
criteria  are  first  met  for  CR/PR  (whichever  is  first  recorded)  until  the  first  date  of  recurrent  or 
progressive  disease  (radiographic),  or  death  due  to  any  cause.  Patients  who  never  progress  while 
being followed will be censored at the last valid tumour measurement. Patients who do not have a 
documented  tumour  progression  or  death  before  initiation  of  new  anti-tumour  therapy  will  be 
censored on the date of their last evaluable tumour assessment prior to or on the date of new anti-
tumour therapy. 
•  Patient-reported quality of life, measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-C13. 
Sample size 
Enrolment of 700 patients was assumed to occur over 38 months. The patients were randomized at 
1:1 ratio to cemiplimab arm or platinum-based chemotherapy arm. A dropout rate of 10% per year 
was assumed. 
Overall Survival 
The MAH assumed without crossover effect a median OS of 13 months for patients treated with 
chemotherapy alone, and a non-proportional HR between cemiplimab and chemotherapy, with an HR 
of 1.05 for the first 6 months and an HR of 0.58 after 6 months. 
With 5 interim analysis planned using Lan-DeMets O’Brien-Fleming alpha spending function, and with 
476 deaths at final analysis of OS, the study had approximately 86% power for detecting a significant 
OS effect at 2-sided α of 0.04 and approximately 88% power for detecting a significant OS effect at 2-
sided α of 0.05. 
Progression-Free Survival 
The MAH assumed a median PFS of 6.4 months for patients treated with chemotherapy alone, and a 
HR between cemiplimab and chemotherapy, with an HR of 1.3 for the first 3 months and an HR of 0.5 
after 3 months. 
With 525 PFS events, the study had approximately 76% power for detecting a significant PFS effect at 
2-sided α of 0.01 and approximately 90% power for detecting a significant PFS effect at 2-sided α of 
0.05.

Randomisation 
Patients were planned for randomization in a 1:1 ratio (experimental to control arm)  
•  Arm 1 (experimental arm): cemiplimab monotherapy  
•  Arm 2 (control arm): platinum doublet chemotherapy  
Randomization was planned to be stratified by the following factors:  
•  Status of histology (squamous, non-squamous) 
•  Geographic region (Europe, Asia, ROW) 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. To reduce bias in the assessment of disease progression, endpoint 
assessments were performed by an IRC blinded to treatment assignment. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis Populations 
Full Analysis population (Intent-to-Treat (ITT])): this includes all randomized patients (N=710). The 
ITT population was based on the treatment allocated (as randomized). All efficacy endpoints were 
analysed using the ITT population by treatment group. 
Modified Intent-to-Treat 1 (mITT-1) population: This includes all randomized patients who were 
enrolled based on tests performed after August 2018 whose tumours expressed PD-L1 in ≥50% of 
tumour cells based on a PD-L1 assay at entry performed in accordance with approved labelling, 
including assay IFU (n=475), as well as patients who were tested before August 2018, but whose PD-
L1 samples required retesting due to PD-L1 quality testing issues and, upon retest, were confirmed as 
having PD-L1 tumour expression in ≥50% of tumour cells based on a PD-L1 assay performed in 
accordance with approved labelling, including assay IFU (n=88) as described in Section 3.6.4. The 
mITT-1 population (N=563) was described in the SAP as the population to be used for a sensitivity 
analyses requested by a health authority for the primary endpoints (OS and PFS). 
Modified Intent-to-Treat 2 (mITT-2) population: This includes all randomized patients who were tested 
after August 2018 whose tumours expressed PD-L1 in ≥50% of tumour cells based on a PD-L1 assay 
at entry performed in accordance with approved labelling, including assay IFU (N=475). The mITT-2 
population was based on the treatment allocated (as randomized). Although the mITT-2 population 
was not pre-specified in the study protocol or SAP, the Sponsor defined this cohort based on pre-
submission interactions with a health authority and a request for the Sponsor to address if there was a 
need to impute PD-L1 expression for the 91 patients whose samples were not available for re-testing 
as described above. This mITT-2 population represents a meaningful randomized cohort that was not 
affected by the PD-L1 testing issues that occurred prior to August 2018. As it avoids any need for 
imputation of PD-L1 expression, it serves to check whether the analyses of the mITT-1 population 
accurately represents the results expected in patients whose tumours express PD-L1 in ≥50% of 
tumour cells based on the 22C3 IHC assay performed in accordance with its approved labelling, 
including assay IFU.

Primary endpoint 
Overall survival 
OS will be analysed by stratified log-rank test using status of histology (non-squamous versus 
squamous) as stratification factor. The HR and its 95% CI will be estimated by a stratified Cox 
regression model with Ephron’s method for tie handling and using the treatment as covariate. The 
stratification factor used in Cox model will be the same factor used in stratified log-rank test. The 
distribution of OS will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.  
Censoring rules: A patient who has not died will be censored at last known date of contact. 
Table 11. Reasons for censoring in overall survival (full analysis set) 
Sensitivity analyses may be performed for OS. The first sensitivity analysis may be performed using 
the Rank Preserving Structural Failure Time (RPSFT) model to account for the effect of the additional 
treatments after disease progression, since patients in the control arm are allowed cemiplimab 
treatment after progressive disease and patients in the cemiplimab arm are allowed cemiplimab plus 
chemotherapy treatment after progressive disease. The second sensitivity analysis using the Restricted 
Mean Survival Time (RMST) method may be conducted to account for the possible non-proportional 
hazards effect. 
Progression free survival 
The primary endpoint of IRC-PFS will be analysed by stratified log-rank test using status of histology 
(non-squamous versus squamous) as stratification factors. The HR and its 95% confidence interval will 
be estimated by a stratified Cox regression model using the treatment as covariate and status of 
histology as stratification factor. The distribution of IRC-PFS will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier 
method. 
Censoring rules: Patients who do not have a documented tumour progression or death will be censored 
on the date of their last evaluable tumour assessment. Patients who do not have a documented tumour 
progression or death before initiation of new anti-tumour therapy will be censored on the date of their 
last evaluable tumour assessment prior to or on the date of new anti-tumour therapy. Patients who 
withdraw consent before taking any study treatment, therefore there is no post baseline tumour 
assessment, will be censored on the date of randomization. Patients who do not have any evaluable 
tumour assessments after randomization and do not die will be censored on the date of randomization. 
Three sensitivity analyses will be performed for IRC-PFS. The first sensitivity analysis is the same as 
the primary analysis except that it considers initiation of new anti-tumour treatment as a progressive 
disease event for patients without documented progressive disease or death prior to initiation of new 
anti-tumour treatment. The second sensitivity analysis is the same as the primary analysis except that 
for the second sensitivity analysis, a patient who has progressive disease or death after missing ≥2 
tumour assessments will be censored at the last evaluable tumour assessment prior to missing ≥ 2 
tumour assessments. The third sensitivity analysis will be performed based on investigator-determined 
progressive disease events.

Key secondary efficacy variable ORR 
The ORR will be analyzed using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by status of histology (non-
squamous versus squamous). ORR and the corresponding 95% exact CI will be calculated by Clopper-
Pearson method for each treatment arm. Not evaluated response includes the missing and unknown 
response. Patients with the best overall response of NE will be considered as non-responder (CR/PR). 
Two sensitivity analyses will be performed for ORR. The first sensitivity analysis will be performed 
based on randomized patients who had at least one valid post-baseline tumour evaluation, except 
those who had an early disease progression/death. The second sensitivity analysis will be performed 
based on investigator-assessed responses. 
Type I error control 
Figure 14. α reallocation strategy between primary endpoints of PFS and OS 
Five interim analyses for OS are planned in addition to the final analysis. The OS hypothesis will be 
tested at overall 2-sided α of 0.04. If IRC-PFS analysis is significant, the OS hypothesis will be tested 
at overall 2-sided α of 0.05 (re-allocated α). The Lan-DeMets O’Brien-Fleming spending function will be 
used for analysis of OS. For the key secondary endpoint of ORR, the type I error rate is controlled by 
hierarchical testing procedure, that is, ORR will only be tested if both analyses of OS and IRC-PFS are 
statistically significant. All other statistical comparisons will be exploratory in nature and, therefore, not 
controlled for multiplicity and should be interpreted accordingly.

Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 3.662 patients were screened for study eligibility. Of the patients screened, 710 were 
randomised (356 patients to cemiplimab and 354 patients to chemotherapy) and 697 were treated 
(355 patients in the cemiplimab arm and 342 patients in the chemotherapy arm) at 137 sites in 24 
countries.  
Among the 2.952 patients failing screening, the most common reason for screen failure was non-
eligibility per inclusion criterion 4 (tumour cells expressing PD-L1 in ≥50% of tumour cells); this was 
reported for 2.270 patients (76.9%) failing screening. 
Patient disposition of the ITT population (N=710) at the date of data cutoff on 01-MAR-2020 is 
summarised in Table 13.

Recruitment 
The original version of the protocol was dated 01-November-2016. Enrolment of the first patient 
occurred under Protocol Amendment 3 dated 15-March-2017; first patient first visit took place on 29-
May-2017. 
The study is being conducted at 138 Investigator sites across 24 participating countries. The highest 
numbers of patients have been enrolled in Turkey (212 patients at 15 sites), Russia (93 patients at 21 
sites), Ukraine (79 patients at 11 sites), Georgia (69 patients at 6 sites), Poland (37 patients at 9 
sites) and Brazil (34 patients at 13 sites). Patients from United States were not included since 
pembrolizumab monotherapy was already approved as 1L treatment for NSCLC.   
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
The protocol was amended on eight occasions. Table 15 outlines the major changes per amendment. 
Protocol amendments 1-5, and 9 did not include changes that could impact on the study results. 
However, protocol amendments 6, 7 and 8 may have had significant impact on the study results:  
•  Amendment 6 (22-AUG-2018) increased the enrolment target from 300 to 700 and radically 
changed initial planned treatment: for patients in the chemotherapy arm who progressed the 
option of crossover to cemiplimab was added, whereas for patients in the cemiplimab arm who 
progressed, the option to continue cemiplimab with the addition of chemotherapy was added. 
•  Amendment 7 (28-MAY-2019) elevated OS as the second primary endpoint and implemented an 
interim analysis for OS.  
•  Amendment 8 (23-OCT-2019) implemented four additional interim analyses.

Inadvertent Aggregation 
An inadvertent aggregation of investigator-determined ORR data by treatment arm, performed by a 
student intern, came to Sponsor’s attention in September 2019. This included data only from the first 
361 patients enrolled and investigator-assessed responses of the open-label study. 
Nevertheless, corrective actions were immediately pursued: all paper and electronic copies were 
destroyed, the medical monitors who had access to the response data were no longer in charge of the 
medical monitoring, and a different medical director took over guidance of the study. The IDMC chair 
was notified. The Sponsor concluded that the study had not been compromised and would continue: 
the information did not compromise equipoise and involved only 51% of the patients enrolled. 
However, the Sponsor determined that the information could be considered potentially material and 
needed to be disclosed as part of its obligations under securities regulations. This was done in the form 
of a press release on 05 Nov 2019.  
The Sponsor also determined that, to provide balance in the press release, it would ask the IDMC to 
perform an interim analysis of OS using the Lan-DeMets approach already pre-specified in the protocol. 
The OS data were independently statistically analyzed and presented to the IDMC in a closed session. 
The IDMC recommended to continue the study; at that time, proof of efficacy had not been reached 
yet. The protocol was then amended (see Appendix 16.1.1 Amendment 8) to increase the number of 
planned interim analyses from the one previously specified, at time of final IRC-PFS, to a total number 
of 5, with the first analysis at approximately 1/3 of OS events coinciding with the timing of the interim 
analysis described above at the time of the inadvertent aggregation of the partial response data. 
Changes Following Study Unblinding/Database Lock and Post-hoc Analyses 
The following were added: 
•  Additional subgroup analyses (brain metastasis at baseline: Y/N; stage of cancer at baseline: 
locally advanced/metastatic) 
• 
• 
Post-hoc analyses (mITT-1 population) for the key secondary endpoint of ORR by IRC and 
other secondary efficacy variables. 
Post-hoc analyses (mITT-2 population) for the primary endpoints of OS and IRC-PFS and for 
the key secondary endpoint of ORR by IRC and other secondary efficacy variables.

Table 19. Prior therapy (ITT population)  
Demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced between the treatment groups; 85% of 
patients were male, and median age was 63 years. Reflecting inclusion/exclusion criteria, all the 
patients were current or previous smokers. Non-squamous histology was observed in 56% of patients, 
and the disease stage at screening was metastatic (Stage IV) in 84% of patients. About 23% of 
patients had received some prior therapy, most commonly radiotherapy, for their disease. 
Numbers analysed 
Due to irregularities in the PD-L1 testing process, a total of 235 patients enrolled before August 2018 
had an initial PD-L1 test result that was considered unreliable. These patients were retested when 
possible, with the retest results used to delineate two modified ITT populations as outlined in Figure 15 
and Table 20.  
The irregularities in PD-L1 testing led to the necessity of defining modified ITT populations for 
statistical analysis purposes. The ITT population represents the whole sample randomised into the 
study, and presentation of results for this population is considered essential. While it can be agreed 
that the mITT-1 is in a strict sense not a randomised population, there is no reason to assume that the 
possibility of systematic bias needs to be considered when evaluating results in this subpopulation. 
The assessment of efficacy results will focus on baseline data for the ITT population (n=710), which is 
the primary population. Results obtained from the two modified ITT populations, i.e. mITT-1 and mITT-
2, are considered supportive.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoints: OS and IRC-PFS 
According to the eighth amendment of the protocol on 23-OCT-2019, the second interim analysis (IA2) 
was planned when approximately 50% of 476 planned OS events at final analysis (~238 deaths) had 
occurred across both arms. After 249 OS events (35% of ITT), on data cut-off date 01-MAR-2020, the 
study met its OS primary endpoint by showing a statistically significant increase in survival with 
cemiplimab monotherapy vs. platinum-based chemotherapy in the targeted population.

Secondary endpoints: Patient-Reported Quality of Life 
Mean  (SD)  baseline  scores  for  General  Health  Status  /  QoL  on  the  EORTC  QLQ-C30  scale  were  59.0 
(21.5) and 59.7 (20.8) in the cemiplimab and chemotherapy treatment groups, respectively, indicating 
impaired QoL. For functioning scores, mean baseline scores generally indicated moderate to high levels 
of functioning; of a possible score of 100, mean baseline functioning scale scores were similar between 
the treatment groups and ranged from 74.0 for physical functioning to 88.5 for cognitive functioning in 
the  cemiplimab  group,  and  from  74.6  for  physical  functioning  to  89.3  for  cognitive  functioning  in  the 
chemotherapy group.  
In the cemiplimab group, an improvement of 5.2 points for mean GHS / QoL was seen by cycle 2; mean 
improvement further increased to above 9 points by cycle 6 (N=230) and above 10 points by cycle 18 
(N=72). In the chemotherapy arm, mean improvement for GHS / QoL was less than 3 points up to cycle 
12; at cycle 12, data in the chemotherapy group was only available for 27 patients. 
There were generally few  changes exceeding the threshold of clinically meaningful improvement (≥10 
points) on functioning scales. For emotional functioning, a mean improvement exceeding 11 points was 
seen at cycle 15 (N=92) for cemiplimab; at the corresponding time point, mean change was 1.5 points 
in the chemotherapy group, although data was only available for 11 patients. 
Mean baseline scores for the 9 symptom scales/items on EORTC-QLQ-C30 were similar between patients 
in the cemiplimab and chemotherapy treatment groups, generally indicating low to moderate symptom 
burden.  In  the  cemiplimab  arm,  a  meaningful  improvement  of  ≥10  points  was  achieved  by  cycle  9  in 
fatigue, pain, dyspnoea, insomnia, and appetite loss. Few changes indicating meaningful improvement 
were observed in the chemotherapy arm. 
Mean baseline symptom scores on the lung cancer-specific EORTC-QLQ-LC13 scale were similar between 
the treatment groups. For lung cancer symptoms, mean improvements of ≥10 points were seen in the 
cemiplimab arm for dyspnoea (cycles 12 [N=139] and 30 [N=16]), pain in chest (from cycle 6 [N=230] 
onward) and pain in other parts (cycles 18 [N=72], 21 [N=44], and 33 [N=9]); in the chemotherapy 
arm, pain in chest improved by ≥10 points at cycle 6 (N=176) and pain in other parts at cycles 21 (N=3), 
24 (N=2), and 27 (N=1). For cough, mean improvements often exceeding ≥10 points were seen from

cycle 4 onward in both treatment groups. Comparable small improvements (generally <10 points) were 
seen in both treatment groups for haemoptysis and pain in arm or shoulder. 
For treatment-related side effects such as sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, and alopecia, 
mean scores remained consistent as compared to baseline among patients in the cemiplimab arm. 
Similar results were observed in the chemotherapy arm, with the exception of significant worsening in 
alopecia as early as cycle 2 and peripheral neuropathy at cycles 5 and 6.  
Ancillary analyses 
Subsequent anticancer treatments 
Table 29. Subsequent anticancer therapies (full analysis set) 
About 20% (71 out of 356) of patients in the cemiplimab arm vs. 45% (157 out of 354) in the 
chemotherapy arm received any subsequent anticancer therapies Table 29. Of note, from the patients 
in the cemiplimab arm who received other therapies, 70% (51 out of 71) received cemiplimab plus 
chemotherapy as extended treatment, as allowed by Amendment 6 of the protocol.  
In the chemotherapy arm, 156 out of 203 progressors by data cut-off (77%) went on to 2L, most of 
them to crossover cemiplimab.

In the analyses of OS and PFS by patient subgroup, point estimates generally favour cemiplimab. 
While there are several subgroups with small sample sizes, and consequently the confidence intervals 
remain wide, the effects are consistent e.g. across age groups and are observable with both histologies 
and among patients with treated brain metastases at baseline.  
IRC-PFS analyses in the ITT population show a consistent benefit of cemiplimab vs. chemotherapy 
across the investigated subgroups. Overall, the subgroup analyses of the primary endpoints of IRC-PFS 
and OS are in line with the primary analysis. 
Sensitivity analysis of OS and PFS using RMST 
The sensitivity analyses using restricted mean survival time method were conducted for OS and PFS in 
the ITT population. In the ITT population, mean survival times were 18.9 (95% CI: 17.5 to 20.3) 
months in cemiplimab arm and 15.8 (95% CI: 14.4 to 17.3) months in chemotherapy arm; p-
value=0.0011; mean PFS time were 9.6 (95% CI: 8.7 to 10.6) months in cemiplimab arm and 6.0 
(95% CI: 5.5 to 6.5) months in chemotherapy arm; p-value< 0.0001.

groups. Value of

Analysis of OS and IRC-PFS by level of PD-L1 expression 
The role of PD-L1 expression as a quantitative variable to predict the survival benefit of cemiplimab was 
investigated. Patients in the mITT-1 and mITT-2 populations were further categorised into 3 subgroups 
by the level of PD-L1 expression (high tertile [≥90%], medium tertile >60% and <90%], and low tertile 
[≥50% and ≤60%]). This analysis was not performed for the ITT population, which included patients 
with unknown results and PD-L1 values <50%. 
Results  for  median  OS  and  PFS  in  the  mITT-1  population  are  displayed  in  Table  34.  Corresponding 
Kaplan-Meier  curves  for  OS  and  PFS  by  PD-L1  expression  in  the  mITT-1  population  are  displayed  in 
Figure  22  and  Figure  23,  respectively.  Median  percent  change  in  tumour  size  after  cemiplimab  or 
chemotherapy treatment was also used as a pharmacodynamic marker in the mITT-1 population (Figure 
24).

In exploratory survival analyses by level of PD-L1 expression, the greatest survival benefits in the 
cemiplimab group were seen among patients with high expression levels, and the change in tumour 
size also correlated with expression level. There was no correlation of PD-L1 expression level and 
survival in the chemotherapy group. This provides further evidence of PD-L1 expression level as a 
potential quantitative biomarker to predict a favourable treatment effect with checkpoint inhibition 
through PD-1. 
Anti-drug Antibodies 
ADAs were analysed among 62% (n=221) of the patients in the cemiplimab arm (n=356). While some 
changes in the sampling schedule were implemented during the study, samples appear to have been 
consistently obtained pre-dose at cycles 9 and 18. 
ADAs to cemiplimab were reported in 11 patients with NSCLC receiving cemiplimab 350 mg Q3W (6 
pre-existing, 5 treatment-emergent or boosted); all were at low titer (<1,000). No NAb were detected 
in the patients with a positive response in the ADA assay. Patients with treatment-emergent ADA 
showed similar cemiplimab exposure in serum compared to the overall population of patients with 
NSCLC who had an ADA-negative response.

According to the MAH, full analysis of primary endpoints, key secondary 
endpoint and all other secondary and exploratory endpoints was conducted 
upon positive outcome for OS at IA #2. However, according to the SAP, only 
OS was to be analysed at IA #2 and all other analyses should therefore be 
considered descriptive.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical study 
The MAH has submitted data from the second interim analysis of Study 1624 as the grounds to support 
the addition of the following proposed therapeutic indication:  
LIBTAYO as monotherapy is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) expressing PD-L1 (in ≥ 50% tumour cells), with no EGFR, ALK or ROS1 
aberrations, who have: 
• locally advanced NSCLC who are not candidates for definitive chemoradiation, or 
• metastatic NSCLC. 
Study 1624 is a phase III, randomised, open-label, multicentre trial, comparing cemiplimab 
monotherapy versus platinum doublet chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced NSCLC not 
eligible for definite chemoradiation, or metastatic NSCLC, with tumours expressing PD-L1 50≥%, with 
no EGFR, ALK, or ROS1 aberrations.  
The primary endpoints of the study are OS and IRC-PFS, intending to show superiority of cemiplimab 
over platinum doublet regimen for patients with advanced NSCLC and PD-L1 expression ≥ 50%. 
Although the chosen comparator is no longer the standard-of-care (SOC) treatment for this high PD-L1 
expressing population, it was considered appropriate at the time the study was discussed at a scientific 
advice (SA) procedure with the CHMP in November 2016. Of note, based on the primary analysis from 
study KEYNOTE-24, pembrolizumab as monotherapy was approved by EMA for the first line treatment 
of patients with metastatic NSCLC and PD-L1 expression ≥50% as of December 2016. In March 2021 
the CHMP granted an indication for atezolizumab in a similar patient population based on results from 
the IMpower110 study (Herbst et al, NEJM 2020), although the definition of PD-L1 positivity is based 
on a different SP142– PD-L1 assay.  
The primary endpoints of OS and IRC-PFS are considered appropriate for confirmatory studies in the 
CHMP Guideline on the clinical evaluation of anticancer medicinal products (EMA/CHMP/205/95 Rev.6). 
The secondary endpoints (ORR and DOR) and the exploratory endpoint of time to new anti-tumour 
treatment are considered appropriate for the targeted disease and patient population, PFS2 was not 
selected as an exploratory endpoint – even when this had been recommended by the CHMP in two SA 
procedures. 
Crossover was allowed, so that patients into the chemotherapy arm could also benefit from second line 
immunotherapy with cemiplimab, particularly since the first patient was randomised in May 2017. As of 
protocol amendment 6, patients randomized to receive cemiplimab 350 mg who experience RECIST 
1.1-defined progression during cemiplimab monotherapy were permitted to continue cemiplimab 
treatment with the addition of 4 cycles of histology-specific chemotherapy until further progression is 
observed, provided, the patient has not completed the 108-week treatment period and protocol-
specified criteria were met. This amendment was based on results from the KEYNOTE-042, KEYNOTE-
189 and KEYNOTE-407 studies. Before amendment 6, a considerable number of progressors from the 
cemiplimab arm continued cemiplimab -as allowed by the protocol- without adding chemotherapy: 17 
out of 24. 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria seem to appropriately reflect the targeted population and match the 
currently proposed therapeutic indication. Several important features of the target population were 
agreed beforehand within a CHMP Scientific Advice procedure in 2016; these include the threshold of 
PD-L1 expression in over 50% of tumour cells; the exclusion of patients with no smoking history; and 
the inclusion of patients with an ECOG performance status of 0 to 1 only.

Selection of the geographical placement of study 1624 was influenced by the approval of 
pembrolizumab as monotherapy first-line treatment of metastatic NSCLC in patients whose tumours 
expressed a high level of PD-L1. The trial design could therefore have been considered unethical in 
countries where pembrolizumab was considered as standard of care for these patients. Consequently, 
countries where patients were enrolled were countries where anti-PD-1 agents were not approved, not 
reimbursed, or not readily available. 
The subpopulation of patients with locally advanced stage (n=115) is highly heterogenous, but few of 
these patients had received previous treatments for their disease. Progression to concurrent 
chemoradiotherapy was not strictly defined within inclusion criteria, but only 3 patients with these 
characteristics were recruited. Inclusion criteria did not suffer significant amendments along study 
conduct. 
The main efficacy analysis population is the FAS (N=710), which included all randomised subjects. 
Enrolment was limited to patients whose tumours expressed PD-L1 in ≥50%. A central commercial 
laboratory was used to analyse PD-L1 expression (IHC 22C3 pharmDx assay), with no EGFR, ALK, and 
ROS1 aberrations in tumour samples. The 22C3 pharmDX assay is FDA-approved in the United States 
for use with pembrolizumab and is CE-marked in the EU. During the course of the study, the MAH 
became aware that PD-L1 testing of samples from Study 1624 at the central commercial laboratory 
(NeoGenomics Laboratories) had a number of quality issues. These issues included (but were not 
limited to): absence of batch controls (negative and positive), cell line control failures being discovered 
more than 2 weeks after the sample results had been reported, and staining inconsistencies causing 
unreliable PD-L1 scoring. Even though corrective and preventative actions were implemented in the 
original testing facility, in November 2018, the MAH initiated transition of PD-L1 testing to Q2 Solutions 
Laboratories where the Dako PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx IUO assay was used in accordance with the 
FDA-approved labelling instruction and the assay IFU was performed under Dako/Agilent supervision. 
The transition of PD-L1 central laboratory to Q2 Laboratories was completed in March 2019. As 
recommended by the FDA, retesting of the samples from study 1624 was performed (for those patient 
samples which were still available). Since not all patients had remaining samples suitable for re-testing 
and not all of the re-tested patients were categorised as PD-L1 ≥50% with the new assay, two 
additional populations were defined: mITT1 (n=563) and mITT-2 (n=475). Since the efficacy analyses 
of these subpopulations were not defined in the SAP, their results are considered as supportive, but 
not suitable for publication at the SmPC.  
The INV-ORR for 50% of the enrolled patients was analysed accidentally and published via a press 
release on 05-NOV-2019 while the study was still recruiting. The degree of influence of data disclosure 
on patients’ behaviour remains uncertain, but its overall impact on B/R is expected to be minimal. On 
the account of complicated access to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in the countries where Study 1624 
took place, it seems unlikely that awareness of results led to a significantly increased number of 
consent withdrawals from patients in the chemotherapy arm. 
The sample size was based on the results observed in clinical studies with other anti-PD-1 treatments, 
assuming non-proportional hazards, but not the crossover effect. Historically, in patients with stage 
IIIB, stage IIIC, or stage IV NSCLC treated with cisplatin or carboplatin + paclitaxel Q3W, the median 
OS and the median PFS ranged from approximately 11.3 to 14.2 months and 4.8 to 6.4 months, 
respectively. For anti-PD-1 monotherapy, a delayed treatment effect in OS and PFS has been observed 
in KEYNOTE-042 and CheckMate 026. In these studies, during the first 6 months of treatment, anti-
PD-1 monotherapies had either no treatment effect or worse treatment effect in OS when compared to 
treatment with chemotherapy, especially in the patient population with PD-L1 expression <50%. 
During the first 3 months of treatment, PD-1 monotherapies had either no treatment effect or worse 
treatment effect in PFS when compared to treatment with chemotherapy, especially in the patient 
population with PD-L1 expression <50%.

The randomisation strategy and block size (4) are acceptable. It is noted that the study design 
included two stratification factors: region of the world and histology, but only histology was considered 
in the log-rank and Cox model. In the EMA guideline on adjustment for baseline covariates in clinical 
trials (EMA/CHMP/295050/2013) it is stated that the primary analysis should reflect the restriction on 
randomization implied by the stratification. A sensitivity analysis that considered both stratification 
factors (only histology had been used) was concordant with the primary analysis. Further sensitivity 
analyses raised from concerns upon the censoring rules were also consistent with the primary analysis. 
The MAH has also presented an additional simulation of OS data based on a model accounting for the 
non-proportional hazards, which is consistent with the primary analysis. 
OS and IRC-PFS were primary endpoints. To control for multiplicity, the MAH implemented an alpha-
allocation strategy. The study has stopped at interim for OS prior to the primary PFS analysis. It is 
noteworthy that the MAH has planned for five interim analyses for OS and none for PFS with three of 
the OS interim analyses before the planned primary PFS analysis, though PFS per definition matures 
faster than OS.  
Overall, the baseline characteristics of age, sex, race/ethnicity, ECOG PS, disease aspects and prior 
cancer-related therapy were evenly distributed between the treatment arms. 85% of patients were 
male, and median age was 63 years. A non-squamous histology was observed in 56% of patients, and 
the disease stage at screening was metastatic (Stage IV) in 84% of patients. About 23% of patients 
had received some prior therapy, most commonly radiotherapy, for their disease. 
A slightly higher dropout rate in the control arm is attributable to the open-label nature of the trial.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
According to the eight amendment of the protocol on 23-OCT-2019, the second interim analysis (IA2) 
was planned when approximately 50% of 476 planned OS events at final analysis (~238 deaths) had 
occurred across both arms.  
At the time of the primary analysis for study 1624, treatment was still ongoing for 184 patients (26%). 
Study treatment had been completed in 42% patients from the chemotherapy arm vs. 2% in the 
cemiplimab arm; the large difference between the groups is due to the different duration of treatment.  
With a median follow-up of 13 months and after 249 OS events (35% of ITT) on data cut-off date 01-
MAR-2020, the study met its OS primary endpoint by showing a statistically significant increase in 
survival with cemiplimab monotherapy vs. platinum-based chemotherapy in the targeted population: 
HR 0.68; 95%CI 0.53, 0.87, p=0.0022. The median OS for the cemiplimab was 22.1 months vs 14.3 
months for the chemotherapy arm, an improvement of 7.8 months. The Kaplan-Meier curves of OS 
start separating after 4 months of therapy. As the primary endpoint was met, IA2 was considered the 
primary analysis, without any further interim analyses planned. As seen in other studies with anti-
PD1/PD-L1 agents in similar settings, non-proportional hazards were evidenced, but an RMST analysis 
that accounts for this issue is concordant with the primary analysis results. 
The apparent OS benefit in the cemiplimab arm is considered clinically relevant, even when several 
uncertainties hamper interpretation of OS results. From the 461 censored patients, 19% in the 
chemotherapy arm and 11% in the cemiplimab arm have withdrawn consent to be followed for 
survival. Follow-up is limited and insufficient to fully characterise OS, especially when considering non-
proportional hazards. Moreover, the effect of crossover on OS is unknown, noticing that after the cut-
off date at 1 March 2020, Amendment 9 was added, allowing all patients in the chemotherapy arm to 
crossover to the cemiplimab arm, even without having progressed on chemotherapy. The influence of 
crossover in OS is considered of major importance. The difference observed in OS could be attributed 
Assessment report  
EMA/319413/2021 
Page 66/100 
 
 
 
 
to the first line treatment (cemiplimab monotherapy) or to ulterior treatment lines. Since all patients 
could receive cemiplimab and chemotherapy, interpretation of the OS results is challenging, with the 
additional difficulty that PFS2 was not captured. To partially address this uncertainty, the MAH 
provided a RPSFT sensitivity analysis to account for crossover effects. Nevertheless, a RPFST sensitivity 
analysis to account for the effects of crossover and a simulation of OS based on a model that accounts 
for non-proportional hazards are consistent with the primary analysis results.  
After 463 PFS events (65%), a trend for benefit of the cemiplimab arm is observed (mPFS 6.2 months 
vs. 5.6 in the chemotherapy arm), although a net advantage of 0.6 months may not be clinically 
relevant. Similar to OS, an effect on PFS is not observed immediately; for PFS, the curve initially 
favours chemotherapy and the curves only cross at about 4 months. It is noted that future updates of 
PFS will not provide an unbiased estimate because of the allowed crossover of chemotherapy patients 
to cemiplimab even before PD (Amendment 9). This lesser magnitude of PFS benefit has also been 
observed in akin immunotherapy trials (IMpower133; Horn et al, NEJM 2018). 
It seemed that less patients in the cemiplimab arm had received subsequent anticancer therapies 
(20% vs. 45% in the chemotherapy arm). However, if the number of patients who received 
subsequent treatments in the cemiplimab arm is relativized to the number of progressors by data cut-
off, the proportion of patients who went on to 2L therapies becomes 45%, in line with the control arm 
and current clinical practice. 
Results from secondary endpoints ORR and DOR support the benefit of cemiplimab over chemotherapy 
in the targeted population. However, relatively large proportions of patients in both treatment groups 
are indicated as being not evaluable for overall tumour response. The major reasons for non-
evaluability were “first time point not yet reached” and “death”. Overall frequencies are quite 
comparable between treatment groups. 
The results on quality of life measures are impacted by decreasing sample sizes and consequently very 
large standard deviations at the later time points. Notable differences between the treatment groups 
include a significant worsening of alopecia and peripheral neuropathy with chemotherapy, which is 
entirely in line with its known adverse effect profile. 
Subgroup analysis of OS in the ITT suggest consistent benefit of cemiplimab over chemotherapy across 
most subgroups, although the degree of benefit is highly variable. For instance, with usual caution 
regarding subgroup sizes, it is noted that the highly heterogeneous subgroup of 115 patients with 
locally advanced disease report a borderline OS benefit from cemiplimab vs. chemotherapy (HR 0.85, 
95% CI 0.43, 1.68) as compared to their metastatic counterparts (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.52, 0.89). The 
forest plot of IRC-PFS shows a consistent benefit of cemiplimab vs. chemotherapy across the 
investigated subgroups. 
OS and PFS-IRC results from the mITT-1 population evidence a higher degree of benefit in the 
cemiplimab arm, but these analyses were not type-1-error-controlled, and hence considered as 
supportive. 
Given low incidence of ADAs to cemiplimab, it is not considered that they had a major impact on 
efficacy or safety. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Interim analysis of Study 1624 has shown statistically significant OS benefit in favour of cemiplimab 
vs. chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC and PD-L1 
≥50%. This advantage is clinically meaningful, as the sensitivity analyses conducted to address 
remaining uncertainties (non-proportional hazards, crossover effect, censoring rules) are consistent

Page 67/100 
 
 
 
 
with the primary analysis. The PFS advantage provided by cemiplimab in the experimental arm is 
marginal and not type-1-error-controlled, although concordant with results of akin anti-PD-1/PD-L1 
monotherapy trials in the 1L setting of advanced NSCLC. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Libtayo  as  monotherapy  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  metastatic  or  locally 
advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). For the initial approval, the safety of cemiplimab 
was  evaluated  in  591  patients  from  studies  1423  (advanced  solid  malignancies,  n=372)  and  1540 
(advanced CSCC, n=219).  
The  most  commonly  reported  adverse  drug  reactions  are  rash  (23.3%),  fatigue  (21.5%),  diarrhoea 
(13.2%) and pruritus (12.3%) (Libtayo SmPC).  
Immune-related adverse reactions occurred in 20.3% of patients treated with cemiplimab in clinical 
trials including Grade 5 (0.7%), Grade 4 (1.2%) and Grade 3 (6.3%). The most common immune-related 
adverse  reactions  were  hypothyroidism  (7.1%),  pneumonitis  (3.7%),  cutaneous  adverse  reactions 
(2.0%),  hyperthyroidism  (1.9%)  and  hepatitis  (1.9%).  Immune-related  adverse  reactions  led  to 
permanent  discontinuation  of  cemiplimab  in  4.4%  of  patients.  Immune-related  pneumonitis  led  to 
permanent discontinuation of cemiplimab in 11 (1.9%) of 591 patients.  
Infusion-related reactions occurred in 54 (9.1%) of 591 patients treated with cemiplimab including 1 
(0.2%)  patient  with  Grade  3  infusion-related  reaction.  Infusion-related  reaction  led  to  permanent 
discontinuation of cemiplimab in 2 (0.3%) patients.  
The  study  population  in  this  application  included  patients  with  advanced  NSCLC  and  ≥50%  PD-L1 
expression in tumour cells and limited to previous and current smokers. Patients with EGFR, ALK or ROS1 
aberrations were excluded.  
The evaluation of safety of cemiplimab for the treatment of advanced NSCLC is based on data from both 
arms of the safety dataset of Study 1624 (N=697).  
Safety Pool 2 (monotherapy population): As supportive data, the MAH has also provided pooled safety 
results from cemiplimab monotherapy across 4 studies (N=816), summarised in Table 1. All patients 
who received at least 1 dose of cemiplimab as monotherapy in Study 1624 (n=355), Study 1423 
(n=130), Study 1540 (n=193), and Study 1620 (n=138) were included in this pool.

Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Leading to Dose Delays or Interruptions 
In Study 1624, 100 (28.2%) patients who received cemiplimab and 106 (31.0%) patients who 
received chemotherapy had AEs resulting in delay or interruption of study drug. The most frequently 
reported AEs resulting in dose delay or interruption of study drug were pneumonia in the cemiplimab 
arm and myelotoxicity in the chemotherapy arm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/319413/2021 
Page 89/100 
 
 
 
 
 
The rates of infections and infestations leading to dose interruption or delay were similar in both 
treatment arm (7.9% for cemiplimab and 7.6% for chemotherapy). In both treatment arms pneumonia 
led to dose delay or interruption at a similar frequency (4.2% in cemiplimab-arm vs 4.4% in 
chemotherapy-arm). 
Endocrine disorders leading to dose delay or interruption were more frequent in cemiplimab-arm 
(2.5%) than in the chemotherapy arm (0%). Of these, hypothyroidism was the most frequent (1.4%). 
Also, disorders affecting skin and subcutis leading to dose delay or interruption were more frequent in 
the cemiplimab-treatment (2.5% vs 0%), rash being the most frequent of these. 
Dose reductions 
As per protocol no dose modifications for cemiplimab were permitted. In the chemotherapy arm, 
14.9% of patients had an AE of any grade leading to dose reduction.  
Post marketing experience 
Cemiplimab is approved in several countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients with 
metastatic or locally advanced CSCC who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation. 
Cumulatively up to 27 Mar 2020, a total of 3547 patients have been treated with investigational 
cemiplimab monotherapy, combination therapy, or comparator in multiple clinical trials. 
The international birth date (IBD) for cemiplimab is 28 Sep 2018 (date of first-ever approval in any 
country). Using the sales data and assuming that all vials sold were administered to patients at the 
approved dose of 350 mg Q3W, the estimated post marketing exposure from the IBD up to 27 Mar 
2020 is 2576.3 patient-years. 
Since the initial approval of cemiplimab, 2 identified risks (immune-related myositis and solid organ 
transplant rejection) have been confirmed. These risks are part of well-known immune related adverse 
events associated with this class of drug. Review of post marketing safety data did not identify any 
new unexpected safety findings. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Cemiplimab received a conditional marketing authorisation from EMA in June 2019, for the treatment 
of locally advanced and metastatic CSCC. Its safety profile had been initially characterised with results 
from 591 patients recruited in Studies 1423 (advanced solid malignancies, n=372) and 1540 
(advanced CSCC, n=219). Considering its anti-PD-1 mechanism of action, the frequency of immune-
related ADRs was about 20%, with the most frequent being hypothyroidism (7.1%), pneumonitis 
(3.7%), cutaneous adverse reactions (2.0%), hyperthyroidism (1.9%) and hepatitis (1.9%). Most 
events were clinically manageable as well as expectable with this class of immunotherapy. 
The MAH has submitted data from the two arms of Study 1624 (N=697) seeking indication of 
cemiplimab in the first line treatment of advanced NSCLC. As supportive data, the MAH has also 
provided pooled safety results from cemiplimab monotherapy across 4 studies (Pool 2, N=816). All 
patients who received at least 1 dose of cemiplimab as monotherapy in Study 1624 (NSCLC, n=355), 
Study 1423 (advanced solid malignancies, n=130), Study 1540 (CSCC, n=193), and Study 1620 (BCC, 
n=138) were included in this pool. 
Study 1624 
As expected from the design of the trial, exposure was longer in the cemiplimab arm (median number 
of doses 9, median duration 27 weeks) as compared to the chemotherapy arm (median number of 
Assessment report  
EMA/319413/2021 
Page 90/100 
 
 
 
 
cisplatin or carboplatin doses 5, median duration 18 weeks). Conversely, treatment was discontinued 
in a greater number of patients in the cemiplimab arm (59%) than in the chemotherapy arm (43%).  A 
greater proportion of progressors led to discontinuation in cemiplimab arm (37%) than in 
chemotherapy arm (25%). These conflicting data are probably related to different lengths of treatment 
and different durations of responses (median 21.0 months for cemiplimab vs. 6.0 months for 
chemotherapy in the ITT population), as well as diverse overall safety profiles. 
At data cut-off, 39.2% of patients in the cemiplimab-arm were still on cemiplimab-treatment and only 
1.7% had completed the treatment reaching the planned 108 weeks. At this point it is not possible to 
draw conclusions of the safety of cemiplimab in the proposed 2-year long treatment for patients with 
advanced NSCLC, particularly when considering its immune-activating mechanism of action. 
Surprisingly, carboplatin was selected as platinum agent for a higher than expected percentage of 
patients (80%). Out of the 134 patients with non-squamous NSCLC who received pemetrexed as part 
of their chemotherapy, 52 (39%) received >6 doses pemetrexed. Assuming that some of these 
patients only did 4 or 5 platinum cycles before starting pemetrexed maintenance, the proportion would 
be slightly higher. This compares to clinical practice and published literature. 
The elevated number of patients (n=22) who withdrew from the cemiplimab arm because of 
patient/physician decision was partially substantiated by the MAH. Differences in exposure from the 
locally advanced and metastatic subpopulations are not major. 
As expected, most of the patients from both arms presented AEs. The proportion of high-grade (G≥3) 
AEs was numerically higher in the chemotherapy arm (48%) as compared to the cemiplimab arm 
(37%). The incidence of SAEs (~28%) and G5 AEs (~9%) was almost identical in both arms. The 
proportion of patients who discontinued treatment permanently because of an AEs was slightly higher 
in the cemiplimab arm (6.5%) as compared to the chemotherapy arm (4.1%).  
The profile of AEs was notably different in the chemotherapy arm vs. the cemiplimab arm. Patients in 
the chemotherapy arm presented higher incidence and severity of myelotoxicity, alopecia, nausea, 
constipation, decreased appetite, neuropathy and fatigue. On the contrary, immune-mediated AEs 
(imAEs) and related endocrine disorders were more prevalent in the cemiplimab arm. 
The three most common G≥3 AEs in the cemiplimab arm were pneumonia 4.8%, anaemia 3.4%, 
pulmonary embolism and hyponatraemia (both 2.5%).  In the chemotherapy arm, the three most 
common G≥AEs were anaemia 16.4%, neutropenia 10.2% and thrombocytopenia 8.2%.The incidence 
of imAEs in patients from the cemiplimab arm of Study 1624 (17.5%) was comparable to that of 
previous studies of cemiplimab and to that seen with other anti-PD-1/anti-PD-1 agents used in clinical 
practice. The most frequent imAEs were hypothyroidism (5.6%), hyperthyroidism (4.2%), pneumonitis 
(2.3%), hepatitis (1.7%), rash (1.7%) and colitis (1.1%). About 80% of all imAEs were G1/2 events 
and were clinically manageable.  
The frequency of infusion-related reactions (6.5%) was in line with what had been previously 
reported at the SmPC (9.1%). 
SAEs occurred in a similar proportion of patients from the chemotherapy (27.5%) and the cemiplimab 
(28.2%) arms, although the causality varied according to arm. Pneumonia was the most common SAE 
and equally prevalent in both arms: 17 cases in each. Other respiratory SAEs were much more 
frequent in the cemiplimab arm: pneumonitis and pulmonary embolism occurred in 12 patients, as 
compared to 2 in the chemotherapy arm. On the other hand, myelotoxic effects such as anaemia and 
febrile neutropenia prevailed in the chemotherapy arm (24 vs. 6 cases).  
Deaths: About two thirds of patients from Study 1624 died from progressive or recurrent disease, 
while the other third died from causes directly or indirectly related to AEs. The proportion of patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/319413/2021 
Page 91/100 
 
 
 
 
who died from respiratory events is higher in the cemiplimab arm (11 out of 34, 32%) as compared to 
the chemotherapy arm (6 out of 31, 19%). Conversely, more patients in the chemotherapy arm died 
from nervous system AEs (12 out of 31, 39%) and cardiac AEs (9 out of 31, 29%). Despite the 
considerable proportion of patients from the chemotherapy arm who experienced haematological AEs, 
high-grade AEs and SAEs, none of them died from causes attributable to myelotoxicity. There were six 
deaths, in which the MAH changed the Investigator´s causality assessment from related to cemiplimab 
to not related. After careful consideration, a reasonable possibility is that cemiplimab might have 
contributed to the fatal outcome of at least 4, if not 5 of these cases. The MAH acknowledges that 
altering the causality deductions carried out by the Investigator by the study sponsor should be 
avoided, unless there is clear evidence. The MAH has further informed that in the future they will 
consider this approach for causal assessments. 
Haematology, electrolytes, liver function tests and coagulation laboratory values do not show 
unexpected findings. Despite the low reported incidence of immune-related hypothyroidism (5.6%), it 
is estimated that a considerable amount of patients might experience subclinical hypothyroidism 
(increased TSH reported in 13.8% and decreased T4 in 8.2% of patients from the cemiplimab arm), 
thus leading to an underestimation of the real proportion of patients who might need further endocrine 
assessment.  
Regarding the safety performance of cemiplimab in special populations, consistent proportions of 
overall AEs, G≥3 AEs, SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation is observed across gender, race, region 
and ECOG PS status. Conversely, the proportion of SAEs and discontinuations in the elderly is slightly 
higher, which prompts the need for specific disclosure at the SmPC. 
A similar proportion of patients from each arm discontinued treatment because of AEs (6.5% in 
the cemiplimab arm vs. 4.1% in the chemotherapy arm), although the causalities differed according to 
arm. In the cemiplimab arm, 5 patients discontinued because of respiratory AEs, most of them 
pneumonitis. In the chemotherapy arm, 6 patients discontinued because of haematological toxicity 
events. 
Monotherapy pool (N=816) 
Exposure patterns in the monotherapy pool were overall comparable to those in Study 1624: median 
duration of treatment is 30.5 weeks and median number of doses is 10.5.  
Regarding AEs, incidence and severity of the diverse AE categories in the monotherapy pool was also 
comparable to those from the cemiplimab arm of Study 1624, although AEs that resulted in death were 
half as prevalent (5.8% vs. 9.6%).  
Incidence of imAEs was 22%, the most frequent being hypothyroidism, pneumonitis, hyperthyroidism, 
colitis, hepatitis and immune-mediated rash. Only 1 death in the entire pool is attributable to an imAE 
of hepatitis. This pattern is comparable to other anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors used in 
clinical practice. 
SAEs occurred in a similar proportion as in patients from the cemiplimab arm of Study 1624, but the 
specific incidence of SAEs of infections in the monotherapy pool was higher.  
The main cause of treatment discontinuation from an AE was pneumonitis, in 15 patients. Immune-
related hepatitis was the second most prevalent cause of discontinuation of cemiplimab in (8 patients). 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, the safety performance of cemiplimab in Study 1624 is as expected from an anti-PD-1 
checkpoint inhibitor in a population of patients with advanced NSCLC, noting a considerable proportion 
Assessment report  
EMA/319413/2021 
Page 92/100 
 
 
 
 
of SAEs and G5 AEs from associated respiratory/mediastinal/thoracic entities. Importantly, the 
incidence, distribution and severity of imAEs compares to previous experience with cemiplimab and 
other checkpoint inhibitors: most immune-mediated events are of low grade and clinically manageable 
with corticosteroid treatment.  
Although similar proportion of SAEs, G5 AEs and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were seen in 
both cemiplimab and chemotherapy arms, it overall seems that cemiplimab is well tolerated and 
compares favourably in relationship to bothersome chemotherapy-related AEs. 
No major safety concerns arise from results in the cemiplimab arm of Study 1624 (N=355) or the 
monotherapy pool containing it (N=816).

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are being 
updated to reflect the addition of the new therapeutic indication in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 
(NSCLC).  
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
There are no changes in legal status or introduction of a new presentation, and no particular critical 
safety issues have been identified with Libtayo. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The indication agreed by the CHMP is:  
Libtayo as monotherapy is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) expressing PD-L1 (in ≥ 50% tumour cells), with no EGFR, ALK or ROS1 
aberrations, who have: 
• 
• 
locally advanced NSCLC who are not candidates for definitive chemoradiation, or  
metastatic NSCLC. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The majority of patients diagnosed with NSCLC are unsuitable for curative treatment. Over the past 
decade, however, substantial progress has been made in the field of immuno-oncology, a treatment 
approach based on inducing host anti-tumor immune responses that lead to clinical responses. Agents 
that block the immunosuppressive PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade, have collectively 
demonstrated clinical activity in numerous solid tumour indications, including NSCLC.  
According to the ESMO 2020 guidelines, pembrolizumab is considered a standard first-line option for 
patients with advanced NSCLC and PD-L1 expression ≥ 50% (22C3 assay) who do not otherwise have 
contraindications to the use of immunotherapy (such as severe autoimmune disease or organ 
transplantation), while atezolizumab represents a promising option in these patients, although 
identified by the TC/IC-based SP142 assay. 
Assessment report  
EMA/319413/2021 
Page 96/100 
 
 
 
 
An unmet need can be identified in the locally advanced subpopulation of NSCLC as no specific 
indication involving an immune checkpoint inhibitor in monotherapy exists.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical study 
Study R2810-ONC-1624 (Study 1624) is a phase III, open-label, randomised, multicentre trial 
designed to compare the efficacy and safety of cemiplimab monotherapy vs. platinum doublet 
chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC as first line treatment. In total, 
710 patients were randomised, 356 patients to the cemiplimab monotherapy arm and 354 patients to 
the chemotherapy arm.  
The MAH has submitted efficacy and safety results from the second interim analysis of Study 1624, 
which is considered the primary analysis. Additionally, pooled safety data from studies where 
cemiplimab was used in monotherapy were provided.  
The primary endpoints of Study 1624 were OS and IRC-PFS and the key secondary endpoint was ORR. 
Other secondary endpoints were DOR and PROs.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
With a median follow-up of 13 months and after 249 OS events (35% of ITT) up to data cut-off 01 
March 2020, results from the second interim analysis of Study 1624 show that the primary OS 
endpoint was met. 
OS showed a statistically significant difference between the two arms in favour of the cemiplimab arm 
(HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.53, 0.87; p-value 0.0022), with median OS of 22.1 months in the cemiplimab arm 
and 14.3 in the chemotherapy arm. Subgroup analysis of OS suggest benefit of cemiplimab over 
chemotherapy across most subgroups. Sensitivity analyses that account for the effect of crossover 
(RPSFT) and non-proportional hazards (RMST) are concordant with the primary analysis results. 
PFS results also favour the cemiplimab arm (median IRC-PFS 6.2 months vs 5.6 months in the 
chemotherapy arm). 
ORR (36% vs. 21% in the cemiplimab and chemotherapy arms, respectively) and median DOR results 
(21 vs. 6 months in the cemiplimab and chemotherapy arms, respectively) support the benefit 
observed in OS and IRC-PFS. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Issues with PD-L1 testing were discovered when over half of the planned population had been 
recruited, creating the need for re-testing of the 235 randomised patients at that point, but not all of 
them had remaining tissue samples (38%) and not all the re-tested samples proved PD-L1 ≥50% 
(24%). As a result of this, two subpopulations from the ITT were created (mITT-1 and mITT-2), whose 
results were consistent with the primary analysis, and hence served as supportive data. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Most patients from both arms of Study 1624 presented AEs, but the toxicity profile was notably 
different in the chemotherapy arm vs. the cemiplimab arm. Patients in the chemotherapy arm 
presented higher incidence and severity of myelotoxicity, alopecia, nausea, constipation, decreased 
Assessment report  
EMA/319413/2021 
Page 97/100 
 
 
 
 
appetite, neuropathy and fatigue. On the contrary, immune-mediated AEs (imAEs) were more 
prevalent in the cemiplimab arm. 
The proportion of high-grade (G≥3) AEs was numerically higher in the chemotherapy arm (48%) as 
compared to the cemiplimab arm (37%).  
The incidence of SAEs (~28%) and G5 AEs (~9%) was almost identical in both arms. Pneumonia was 
the most common SAE. The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment permanently because of 
an AE was slightly higher in the cemiplimab arm (6.5%) as compared to the chemotherapy arm 
(4.1%). 
The incidence of imAEs in patients from the cemiplimab arm of Study 1624 (17.5%) was comparable 
to that of previous studies of cemiplimab and to that seen with other anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 agents used 
in clinical practice. The most frequent imAEs were hypothyroidism (5.6%), hyperthyroidism (4.2%), 
pneumonitis (2.3%), hepatitis (1.7%), rash (1.7%) and colitis (1.1%). About 80% of all imAEs were 
G1/2 events and were clinically manageable. 
The reported incidence of immune-related hypothyroidism in the cemiplimab arm (5.6%) might 
underestimate subclinical hypothyroidism: the proportion of patients with increased TSH is 13.8% and 
with decreased T4 is 8.2%. 
The overall safety performance of cemiplimab in the NSCLC population of Study 1624 (Pool 1, N=355) 
is comparable to the cemiplimab monotherapy pool (Pool 2, N=816).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
According to the CHMP Guideline on the evaluation of anticancer medicinal products in man 
(EMA/CHMP/205/95 Rev.5), convincingly demonstrated favourable effects on survival are, from both a 
clinical and methodological perspective, the most persuasive outcome of a clinical trial. At its second 
interim analysis, Study 1624 met its primary OS endpoint, showing superiority of cemiplimab vs. 
chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC, no targetable genetic aberrations 
and PD-L1 expression ≥ 50%. The PFS data from Study 1624 could be considered to favour 
cemiplimab over chemotherapy upon a modest advantage. 
Regarding safety, cemiplimab exhibited an acceptable toxicity profile, as expected from an anti-PD-1 
checkpoint inhibitor. The incidence and severity of imAEs was within reasonable ranges, with 
comparable results between the cemiplimab arm from both Study 1624 and the cemiplimab 
monotherapy pool. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In terms of OS and IRC-PFS, cemiplimab showed an efficacy advantage as compared to chemotherapy 
in the treatment of patients with locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC with high-expression of PD-L1 
and not targetable genetic aberrations. This benefit is consistent across most sensitivity analyses and 
most of the analysed subgroups. The toxicity profile of cemiplimab is acceptable and compares 
favourably to chemotherapy. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Issues on PD-L1 testing along conduct of the study led to the definition of a modified ITT population 
(mITT-1) that only contained patients for which high PD-L1 status had been confirmed. OS and PFS-
IRC results from this population evidence a slightly higher degree of benefit from the cemiplimab arm, 
but their analysis was not predefined in the SAP. Subsequently, and in respect of the ITT principle, 
these data are only considered supportive evidence. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Libtayo is positive.

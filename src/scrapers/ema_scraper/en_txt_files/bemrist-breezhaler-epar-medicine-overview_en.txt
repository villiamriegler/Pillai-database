Bemrist Breezhaler (indacaterol / mometasone)
An overview of Bemrist Breezhaler and why it is authorised in the EU
What is Bemrist Breezhaler and what is it used for?
Bemrist Breezhaler is a medicine that is used to keep the airways open in adults and children aged 12 
years and older whose asthma is not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and inhaled 
short acting beta-2 agonists. Bemrist Breezhaler is used for maintenance (regular) treatment. 
The medicine contains the active substances indacaterol and mometasone.
How is Bemrist Breezhaler used?
Bemrist Breezhaler capsules, which contain a powder for inhalation, are to be used only with the 
inhaler provided with each prescription and must not be swallowed. To receive a dose, the patient 
places a capsule into the inhaler and breathes in the powder through the mouth.
The recommended dose is one capsule, once a day at the same time each day. Patients should not use 
more than one capsule in a day. The capsules are available in three strengths (125 micrograms / 
62.5 micrograms, 125 micrograms / 127.5 micrograms, 125 micrograms / 260 micrograms) and the 
doctor will decide which strength the patient should use based on the patient’s need.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription. 
For more information about using Bemrist Breezhaler, see the package leaflet or contact your doctor or 
pharmacist.
How does Bemrist Breezhaler work?
The two active substances in Bemrist Breezhaler are well known and are present in several medicines 
used to treat respiratory obstructive diseases, either alone or in combination with other medicines. 
Indacaterol, is a long acting beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist. It works by attaching to targets called 
beta-2 receptors in the muscle cells that surround the airways into the lungs. When Bemrist Breezhaler 
is inhaled, indacaterol reaches the receptors and activates them. This causes the muscles of the 
airways to relax, helping to keep the airways open and allowing the patient to breathe more easily. 
Mometasone belongs to a group of anti-inflammatory medicines known as corticosteroids. It works in a

similar way to naturally occurring corticosteroid hormones, reducing the activity of the immune 
system. By attaching to receptors in various immune cells it blocks the release of substances involved 
in the inflammation process, such as histamine, thereby helping to keep the airways clear and allowing 
the patient to breathe more easily. 
What benefits of Bemrist Breezhaler have been shown in studies?
In two main studies involving over 3,000 patients with asthma, Bemrist Breezhaler was compared with 
mometasone alone or a combination salmeterol and fluticasone (other inhaled medicines used to treat 
asthma). The main measure of effectiveness was based on changes in the patients’ forced expiratory 
volumes (FEV1, the maximum volume of air a person can breathe out in one second). FEV1 was 
measured just before the next dose was due when it was likely to be at its lowest. 
In the first study, Bemrist Breezhaler was more effective than mometasone alone at improving how 
well the airways work in patients with asthma. The average FEV1 in patients who received Bemrist 
Breezhaler (125 micrograms/62.5 micrograms) was about 180 ml more than with an equivalent dose 
of mometasone after 12 weeks of treatment.
In the second study, medium and high strength Bemrist Breezhaler led after 26 weeks to average FEV1 
of about 130 ml to 210 ml more than patients who received equivalent doses of mometasone. The 
treatment difference between high strength Bemrist Breezhaler (125 micrograms/260 micrograms) and 
the combination of salmeterol and fluticasone was about 40 ml in favour of Bemrist Breezhaler.
The studies also showed an improvement in symptoms such as breathlessness and wheezing.
What are the risks associated with Bemrist Breezhaler?
The most common side effects with Bemrist Breezhaler (which may affect more than 1 in 10 people) 
are worsening of asthma and nasopharyngitis (inflammation in the nose and throat). Other common 
side effects (which may affect up to 1 in 100 people) include upper respiratory tract infection (nose 
and throat infections) and headache. For the full list of all side effects and restrictions with Bemrist 
Breezhaler, see the package leaflet. 
Why is Bemrist Breezhaler authorised in the EU?
The European Medicines Agency concluded that Bemrist Breezhaler was effective at improving lung 
function and symptoms in asthma. The Agency also noted that there were no major safety concerns 
with Bemrist Breezhaler, with side effects being manageable and similar to other inhaled medicines of 
the same class. Therefore, the Agency decided that Bemrist Breezhaler’s benefits are greater than its 
risks and it can be authorised for use in the EU.
What measures are being taken to ensure the safe and effective use of 
Bemrist Breezhaler?
Recommendations and precautions to be followed by healthcare professionals and patients for the safe 
and effective use of Bemrist Breezhaler have been included in the summary of product characteristics 
and the package leaflet.
As for all medicines, data on the use of Bemrist Breezhaler are continuously monitored. Side effects 
reported with Bemrist Breezhaler are carefully evaluated and any necessary action taken to protect 
patients.

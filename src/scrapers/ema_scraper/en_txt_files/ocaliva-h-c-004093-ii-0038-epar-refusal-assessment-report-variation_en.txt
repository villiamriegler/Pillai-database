1.  Background information on the procedure 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Advanz Pharma Limited 
submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 22 December 2022 an application for a variation. 
The following changes were proposed: 
Variation requested

Annexes 
affected 
C.I.4  
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new 
Type II 
I, II and IIIB 
quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
Update of sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to update clinical information based on final 
results from studies 747-302 and 747-401, listed as specific obligations in the Annex II, as well as 
results from real-world evidence (RWE) studies evaluating analyses of hepatic clinical outcomes. Study 
747-302 is a confirmatory double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled multicentre study investigating 
the clinical benefit associated with Ocaliva treatment in patients with PBC who are either unresponsive 
or intolerant to UDCA treatment based on clinical endpoints, while study 747-401 is a double-blind, 
randomised, placebo-controlled study evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetics of Ocaliva in patients 
with PBC and moderate to severe hepatic impairment. The Annex II and Package Leaflet are updated 
accordingly. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II 
and Package Leaflet. 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
Obeticholic acid (OCA) was granted a conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) in the European Union 
(EU) in December 2016, for its administration in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) for the 
treatment of adult patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) who have an inadequate response to 
UDCA, or as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA. This initial approval was based on results 
from the phase 3, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled Study 747-301, which demonstrated a 
clinically and statistically significant, sustained reduction in alkaline phosphatase (ALP).  
At the time of the CMA granted for Ocaliva, efficacy had only been shown in terms of ALP reductions, 
with rare cases of normalization. Thus, the main efficacy uncertainty was to what extent those changes 
in laboratory parameters correlate with a risk reduction in relevant clinical liver outcomes in PBC patients, 
and thus, on the actual clinical benefit of OCA treatment. Other important uncertainties were the lack of 
efficacy/safety data in patients with a more advanced stage of the disease, and concerns on long-term 
(liver and CV) safety data. Given the lack of treatment options in patients unresponsive or unable to 
tolerate UDCA and the debilitating nature of PBC, a CMA was granted based on incomplete data with the 
condition to address these limitations, and provide comprehensive data, within two PAES requested as 
specific  obligations  (SOBs).  Full  approval  of  OCA  was  contingent  on  a  post-approval  requirement  to 
confirm  efficacy  and  safety  by  assessing  the  effect  of  OCA  on  clinical  outcomes  such  as  hepatic 
decompensation, liver transplant, and death and across the spectrum of liver disease severity.

In  the  post-authorisation  phase  the  MAH  reported  enrolment  and  retention  difficulties  for  study  747-
302, and a transition to an open label design versus historic control was proposed, or a revision of the 
composite primary endpoint. Neither proposal was deemed acceptable at the time to the CHMP.   
In 2020, based on a review of a protocol-specified interim analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint of 
study 747-302, and of ad hoc safety and pharmacokinetic data from studies 747-302 and 747-401, the 
independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) concluded that “Study 747-302 (COBALT) is unlikely to 
provide evidence of efficacy for the enrolled PBC population as an aggregate or in any subpopulation”. 
The IDMC also recommended that there be no further enrolment in either study (747-302 and 747-401), 
based on feasibility concerns. The MAH considered that it would be no longer feasible to establish the 
safety and efficacy of Ocaliva in PBC patients with decompensated cirrhosis or a prior decompensation 
event, from studies 747-302 and 747-401 (the later having been imposed to this aim). Therefore, taking 
also  into  account  post-marketing  data  suggesting  an  association  between  hepatic  events  and  this 
treatment in patients with decompensated cirrhosis or a prior decompensation event, a variation was 
submitted to contraindicate Ocaliva in those patients (EMEA/H/C/004093/II/0030), and study 747-401 
was prematurely terminated. Study 747-302 was also prematurely terminated. 
The MAH has now submitted results of these two SOBs, which constitute the primary evidence of efficacy 
and safety, aimed to confirm the benefits and risks of Ocaliva across the spectrum of PBC patients after 
failure or intolerance to UDCA. Unfortunately, none of these two studies have been completed as both 
were prematurely terminated.  
SOB#2 - Interventional study 747-401 
This SOB was aimed at assessing the PK and safety profile of OCA in patients with more advanced liver 
disease and was imposed by CHMP at the time of granting of the initial CMA. The study was prematurely 
terminated  following  an  SmPC  update  in  2021  within  variation  procedure  EMEA/H/C/004093/II/0030 
concluded in May 2022.  In this procedure the MAH applied for a contraindication in patients with more 
advanced liver disease and provided post marketing data suggesting a clear association between hepatic 
events and PBC patients taking Ocaliva particularly in cirrhosis patients (CP-B and C). At termination of 
the study, it only included 22 out of the planned 50 subjects. Results of this placebo-controlled study 
show a significant toxicity and the possible contribution of OCA treatment cannot be ruled out.  Despite 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 5/319 
 
  
 
 
 
testing a reduced dose of OCA (5mg once a week, titrated to 5mg twice a week), treatment was poorly 
tolerated  in  both  treatment  arms.  All  22  (100.0%)  subjects  reported  at  least  1  treatment-emergent 
adverse  event  (TEAE).  The  most  common  TEAEs  were  ascites,  oesophageal  varices  haemorrhage, 
pneumonia, all of them reported most frequently in OCA treated arm. Treatment-related TEAEs occurred 
in 4 (40.0%) subjects in the OCA group and 6 (50.0%) subjects in the placebo group. Nine (90.0%) 
subjects in the OCA group and 9 (75.0%) subjects in the placebo group experienced TEAEs of special 
interest.  Six  (60.0%)  subjects  in  the  OCA  group  and  7  (58.3%)  subjects  in  the  placebo  group 
experienced  severe  (Grade  3)  TEAEs.  Related  Grade  3  TEAEs  included  upper  gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage, hepatic failure, pyrexia, and hepatic function abnormal. Of the Grade 3 TEAEs, 4 subjects 
experienced a TEAE (multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, cardiac arrest, hepatic encephalopathy, and 
aortic aneurysm rupture, respectively) that resulted in a  fatal outcome, which were all not related or 
unlikely related to the study treatment. Overall, study treatment discontinuations occurred in 5 (50.0%) 
subjects in the OCA arm and 5 (41.7%) in the placebo groups and study treatment interruptions occurred 
in 5 (50.0%) subjects in the OCA and 4 (33.3%) subjects in the placebo groups. Four subjects (3 OCA-
treated and 1 placebo-treated) experienced a TEAE of upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage, cardiac arrest 
secondary to bleeding from oesophageal varices, hepatobiliary disorder, and ascites, respectively) that 
led to both study drug interruption and study discontinuation. A total of 7 (70.0%) subjects in the OCA 
and 9 (75.0%) subjects in the placebo groups experienced serious adverse events (SAEs). Six out of the 
7 subjects in OCA reported SAEs of bleeding of oesophageal varices/upper GI haemorrhage (4 cases) or 
cardiac arrest/MI (2) vs no subjects in placebo. Five subjects died during the study (3 among placebo-
treated  subjects  due  to:    hepatic  encephalopathy,  aortic  aneurysm  rupture,  and  clear  cell  renal  cell 
carcinoma; and 2 among OCA-treated subjects due to: multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and cardiac 
arrest).  
Overall,  no  relevant  differences  were  observed  between  treatment  arms  in  the  incidences  of  TEAEs, 
Grade 3 TEAEs, SAEs TEAEs, and those noted can be explained by the low number of subjects in each 
treatment arm. Indeed, the low number of subjects included and premature study interruption, do not 
allow  reaching  sound  conclusions  on  the  actual  safety  profile  of  OCA  in  PBC  with  an  advanced  liver 
disease. Nevertheless, a numerical difference between treatment arms, disfavouring OCA treatment, is 
systematically observed for hepatic AESI (9 patients (14 events) OCA vs 8 patients (11 events) placebo), 
cardiac AESIs (3 patients 5 events in OCA vs 1 subject/event placebo), pruritus (3 OCA vs 1placebo), 
and bleeding GI events (both Grade 3 and SAEs were reported in OCA patients while no such cases were 
reported in placebo (4 in OCA: 3 events of bleeding of oesophageal varices +1 upper GI haemorrhage 
OCA treated groups), which support the current contraindication in the SmPC.   
OCA treatment is contraindicated in “Patients with decompensated cirrhosis (e.g., Child-Pugh Class B or 
C)  or  a  prior  decompensation  event  (see  section  4.4)”,  due  to  the  increased  risk  of  hepatic 
failure/decompensation events, including fatal cases. The worse safety profile of OCA in patients with 
moderate-severe hepatic impairment is confirmed from the available submitted evidence from clinical 
trials  and  the  post-marketing  experience.  Within  variation  procedure  EMEA/H/C/004093/II/0030, 
measures  have  been  put  in  place  to  minimise  this  risk,  i.e.  a  contraindication  in  section  4.3  and 
precautionary  wording  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  to  include  new  information  about  hepatic 
decompensation and failure, sometimes fatal or resulting in liver transplant, occurring with obeticholic 
acid treatment in patients with PBC with cirrhosis, either compensated or decompensated. Section 4.8 
(‘Undesirable effects’) was also updated to include hepatobiliary disorders in the tabulated list of adverse 
reactions.  
Based  on  the  quantitative  analysis  conducted  considering  sales  data,  the  data  presented  shows  a 
continuous downward trend in the reporting rate of hepatic AEs from 2017 until 2023, including fatal 
cases, although the correlation with relevant RMM milestones is not evident as claimed by the MAH. The 
decrease  in  reporting  is  not  a  probe  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  current  RMM,  as  this  might  well  be 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 6/319 
 
  
 
 
explained by a shift in the source of data from clinical trials to spontaneous reporting with an obvious 
risk of under notification with prolonged time on the market aggravated by the fact that these hepatic 
events would be expected by the progression of the underlying condition. Thus, although the quantitative 
data provided is reassuring, they do not allow concluding that the current Risk Minimisation Measures 
have been duly effective.  
In relation to SOB 2 the main uncertainty driving this requirement, i.e. lack of safety evidence in patients 
with  more  advanced  liver  disease  to  establish  B/R,  is  addressed  and  the  safety  profile  is  deemed 
unfavourable. The available evidence shows a severe toxicity profile of OCA treatment in these patients 
that led to the inclusion of a contraindication and several precautionary measures to minimise the risk 
(Variation procedure EMEA/H/C/004093/II/0030). 
SOB#1 - Interventional Study 747-302 
Efficacy issues 
This SOB was imposed at the time of approval to confirm the efficacy and safety, in clinically relevant 
outcomes/endpoints, associated with OCA treatment in patients with PBC who are either unresponsive 
or intolerant to UDCA treatment. According to the MAH, the study has faced enrolment and retention 
difficulties and a transition to an open label design versus historic control was proposed. This plan was 
discussed several times with the CHMP and deemed not acceptable as it would not address the remaining 
uncertainties  on  the  efficacy  of  Ocaliva.  The  MAH  also  proposed  a  revision  of  the  composite  primary 
endpoint, to extend the list of components adding some less robust components to increase the power 
of the study, which was not agreed by the CHMP either. The study was prematurely terminated by the 
Sponsor at the time when the study had randomized nearly 80% of the planned participants (i.e. 334 of 
the targeted 428 patients) and approximately 67% of the protocol-specified number of clinical events 
had  been  observed  (last  patient  last  visit  Dec  2021).  This  followed  the  recommendations  of  the  data 
monitoring committee due to “feasibility challenges”. However, it is noted that with 67% of the planned 
events, which is not a negligible portion, the study failed to show any differences between treatments 
for  the  primary  composite  endpoint  of  death, liver  transplant,  or  hepatic  decompensation  for  the  ITT 
population: HR 1.01 (95%CI: 0.68, 1.51), p-value: 0.954. Notably, the results for the primary endpoint 
according to the liver disease status (compensated vs decompensated) show a numerical increment in 
the  risk  of  event  outcomes  in  decompensated  patients  treated  with  OCA  (59.4%  OCA  vs  54.1%  in 
placebo, HR 1.22 [95% CI: 0.65, 2.28]), though not statistically significant. By contrary, results were 
nearly identical in both treatment arms in the subgroup of compensated PBC patients (21.3% vs 21.7% 
OCA and placebo, respectively, HR 0.98 [95% CI: 0.58, 1.64]). Thus, the study has failed to demonstrate 
any efficacy of OCA treatment in relevant clinical outcomes and across the spectrum of PBC patients.  
Secondary endpoint analyses show that only a total of 21 (6.3%) patients enrolled in Study 747-302 
met the primary endpoint as defined in the initial pivotal phase 3 Study 747-301 of an ALP <1.67x ULN 
and total bilirubin ≤ULN and ALP decrease from baseline of ≥15%. Indeed, the rate of responders was 
substantially lower compared to that previously reported and this was the case in both treatment arms, 
but rather noticeable in the OCA treated group (OCA 10.1% vs 2.4% placebo in Study 747-302 compared 
to OCA 34.0% vs 7% placebo in Study 747-301). No statistically significant differences were reported, 
adding even further uncertainties to the actual efficacy of OCA in the treatment of PBC. The MAH was 
requested to explain the observed differences, considering that Study 747-302 included a more advanced 
liver disease population likely representative of the actual target population in clinical practice. The MAH 
argues that the actual target population in clinical practice is more like that included in Study 747-301, 
based on comparison of baseline disease characteristics of European registries, and much less severe 
than that included in Study 747-302. It is also argued that subjects with higher values at baseline might 
unlikely reach normal (or near normal) biochemical ALP/BR values, and that similar absolute changes in 
ALP values are expected (and thus similar benefits from treatment). However, the actual meaning of the 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 7/319 
 
  
 
 
observed quantitative reductions of ALP/BR values, in the absence of concurrent changes in histological 
progression, is highly uncertain and of doubtful clinical relevance. Indeed, the predictive value of the 
changes  in  biochemical  parameters  with  respect  to  relevant  clinical  outcomes  in  PBC  has  not  been 
established yet. Summarising, OCA treatment has demonstrated to reduce ALP (and BR) levels, though 
the  effect  is  of  modest  magnitude  and  the  actual  clinical  meaning  is  uncertain,  moreover,  the 
confirmatory trial has failed to demonstrate the efficacy of OCA treatment in clinical outcomes. 
While the MAH acknowledges that the SOB studies, as designed, will be considered the primary evidence 
characterizing the safety and efficacy of OCA in patients with PBC, they have provided additional data 
(including from real-world sources) as supplementary information. This includes results of the long-term 
safety extension (LTSE) of the pivotal phase 3 trial submitted with the initial application (Study 747-
301), plus results of three real-world evidence (RWE) studies; i.e. two externally controlled analyses of 
OCA-treated patients from studies 747-301/301 LTSE and 747-302, and a (fully) RWE study (745-405). 
External controls come from the Global PBC and United Kingdom (UK) PBC registries, as well as from 
the Komodo Health US Claims database. 
The results submitted from the above mentioned external control (EC) studies/analyses, based on RWD, 
are  not  considered  robust  evidence  valid  to  overcome  the  negative  results  of  well-  designed  and 
conducted  double-blind,  randomised,  placebo-controlled  trials.  The  observed  differences  in  the 
estimation  of  the  treatment  effect  for  the  primary  endpoint  using  the  primary  randomisation  and  the 
inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW), demonstrate the high risk of bias associated to the 
provided  analysis(es) based  on the  weighting procedure  as  compared  to  the results  from  Study  747-
302.  All  results  based  on  the  EC  are  considered  to  have  the  same  problem  of  bias.  Furthermore,  in 
addition to all the issues discussed in this report, the analyses resulting from the post-hoc comparisons 
with EC should be understood in the context of a pivotal trial in which the primary analysis failed, leaving 
no  alpha  for  confirmatory  testing.  As  a  result,  any  further  analyses  should  be  considered  exploratory 
only. The MAH was invited to discuss these issues. Some of the MAH's comments are aimed at justifying 
the invalidity of the placebo test group, which is also the basis for justifying the use of external controls. 
However, despite the fact that the current estimation of the treatment effect might be confounded to 
some extent, should this occur, it would be in both treatment arms and not just in placebo. Therefore, 
any post-hoc external comparison to overcome the failed trial results is invalid, especially as these RWE 
results are very far from the results of a randomised comparison. Furthermore, in contrast to the trial, 
MELD could not be assessed in the EC comparison as a measure of baseline balance and as a component 
of the primary endpoint, and notably, patients were censored at the occurrence of an ICE (Intercurrent 
Event), which was handled in the trial using the treatment policy strategy for the primary assessment. 
Furthermore, propensity score methods are useful tools for balancing for prognostic factors, but unlike 
randomisation,  they  only  allow  adjustment  for  known  and  measured  factors,  so  that  they  will  never 
overcome  the  effect  of  randomisation.  The  MAH  states  that  the  treatment  effects  were  remarkably 
consistent, but the divergence from the trial results only points out that there is a remarkable divergence 
due to the lack of a randomised comparison and that there is a very high risk of residual confounding in 
the baseline balance and during the follow-up. As a result of this, the demonstration of efficacy of OCA 
in the treatment of PBC would be mainly based on the results of the trials, and the RWE is considered 
only as complementary and exploratory with a much lower level of evidence than the trial results. 
Safety issues 
From a safety point of view, Study 747-302 shows a more concerning overall safety profile as compared 
to that reported in the initial submission, given the higher incidence rates of all types of TEAEs overall 
and as compared to placebo treated patients. OCA treated patients showed a higher incidence of TEAEs, 
severe TEAEs, TEAEs leading to discontinuation, and TEAEs leading to death, both in the general safety 
population and the subset of patients with compensated liver disease, which does not speak in favour of 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 8/319 
 
  
 
 
a  favourable  and  well  tolerated  safety  profile.  In  addition,  the  higher  rates  observed  in  OCA  treated 
patients for some relevant AESI like cardiovascular events (including adjudicated MACE), renal events 
(including AKI), DILI and portal hypertensive gastropathy events, liver transplant and death adjudicated 
events, both in the overall safety population and for the subset of patients with compensated disease 
are a matter of major concern. 
The  MAH  recognizes  there  is  some  potential  safety  risk  given  the  imbalance  observed  in  the  overall 
safety population of Study 747-302 and cannot exclude a contributory role of OCA. Therefore, the MAH 
has proposed to further restrict the SmPC indicated population to patients with PBC without cirrhosis or 
with  compensated  cirrhosis  who  do  not  have  clinical  evidence  of  portal  hypertension  or  a  prior 
decompensation event. Comparative safety data in the restricted indication have been presented, though 
this analysis was not pre-specified and the newly proposed target population for OCA is data driven by 
an otherwise limited subset of early stage PBC subjects of Study 747-302 (68 OCA vs 61 placebo), which 
hampers the interpretation of the reported results. Thus, it is uncertain if the observed results in this 
subset of the study population represent an accurate estimation of their safety profile and thus if a “more 
benign” safety profile can be firmly concluded in them. 
The MAH addressed the Major objection in an oral explanation to the CHMP reiterating largely previous 
argumentation  that  the  failure  of  study  742-302  could  be  explained  by  bias  also  referring  to  results 
generated  in  RWE  studies.  The  MAH  agreed  that  the  switch  from  a  conditional  to  a  full  marketing 
authorisation is not approvable at present and proposed a registry study as a follow up specific obligation, 
a drug utilisation study and the implementation of further risk minimisation measures to maintain the 
benefit risk balance positive within this CMA. The oral explanation did not change the CHMPs negative 
opinion on the outcome of this variation procedure as outlined in the assessment report. 
In conclusion, the confirmatory study 747-302 has failed to demonstrate the clinical benefit of OCA 
treatment  in  reducing  the  risk  of  relevant  clinical  outcomes  in  patients  with  PBC,  regardless  of  liver 
disease severity. The clinical effect on liver outcomes is absent in the ITT population (HR 1.01) and even 
might  be  detrimental  in  decompensated  patients  (HR  1.22).  Further,  the  results  submitted  from  the 
external  control  studies/analyses  are  not  valid  evidence  to  overcome  the  failed  RCT.  The  absence  of 
improvement of liver histology further correlates these findings. The MAH´s attempt to restrict post-hoc 
OCA use to an early stage PBC sub-population cannot be an acceptable strategy given that the results 
were nearly identical in both treatment arms (HR 0.98). The proposals to amend the SmPC including 
also a restriction of the indication and updates applied to the SmPC cannot be agreed with in view of the 
concerns  raised  on  the  demonstration  of  efficacy  and  safety  in  the  whole  target  population.  As  a 
consequence,  the  SOB#1,  aimed  to  address  the  main  efficacy  uncertainty  at  the  time  of  granting  a 
Conditional Marketing Authorisation (CMA), i.e. to what extent those changes in biochemical parameters 
correlate with a risk reduction in relevant clinical liver outcomes in PBC patients and thus, the actual 
clinical benefit of OCA treatment, is not fulfilled.   
These results do not allow to update the product information and to convert the CMA to a standard MA.  
Therefore, the type II variation is not approvable.  
The  lack  of  a  demonstrated  benefit  in  relevant  clinical  outcomes  in  PBC  patients  and  the  confirmed 
increased  risk  of  CV  events  (including  MACE),  liver  DILI,  renal,  transplant  death  events,  and  poor 
treatment tolerability, both in the overall study population and in the restricted mildly symptomatic early-
stage subset, raise question on the actual benefit/risk balance of OCA in the treatment of PBC patients 
that will need to be addressed in the appropriate procedure.

Update of sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to update clinical information based on final 
results from studies 747-302 and 747-401, listed as specific obligations in the Annex II, as well as

Update of Annex II of the Product information to remove studies 747-302 and 747-401, listed as

Study 747-302 is a confirmatory double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled multicentre study 
investigating the clinical benefit associated with Ocaliva treatment in patients with PBC who are either 
unresponsive or intolerant to UDCA treatment based on clinical endpoints, while study 747-401 is a 
double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetics of 
Ocaliva in patients with PBC and moderate to severe hepatic impairment. The Annex II and Package 
Leaflet are updated accordingly. 
Is not approvable. 
Grounds for refusal 
Whereas 
•  The confirmatory study 747-302 has failed to demonstrate the clinical benefit of OCA 
treatment in reducing the risk of relevant clinical outcomes in patients with PBC, regardless of 
liver disease severity and the absence of improvement of liver histology is further 
corroborating these findings. 
•  The results submitted from the external control studies/analyses, based on RWD, are not 
considered to provide a sufficient level of evidence valid to demonstrate the efficacy of 
Ocaliva. The observed differences in the estimation of the treatment effect for the primary 
endpoint using the primary randomisation and the inverse probability of censoring weighting 
(IPCW), demonstrate the high risk of bias associated to the provided analysis(es) based on 
the weighting procedure as compared to the results from Study 747-302. All results based on 
the external controls are considered to have the same problem of bias. Besides, the analyses 
resulting from the post-hoc comparisons with external controls should be understood in the 
context of a pivotal trial in which the primary analysis failed, leaving no alpha for 
confirmatory testing. As a result, any further analyses should be considered exploratory only. 
Therefore, due to methodological limitations these RWE cannot be considered a robust 
demonstration of efficacy, in the context of the negative results of the well-designed and 
conducted double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial 747-302. 
• 
In view of the concerns raised on the demonstration of efficacy and the safety observed in the 
whole target population based on the provided data including Study 747-302, 747-401 and 
results from real-world evidence (RWE) studies, the proposed amendments of the SmPC 
(including restriction of the indication) cannot be agreed. The evidence submitted do not allow 
to consider that the uncertainties on the efficacy of Ocaliva were addressed and to convert

5.  Introduction 
Initial MAA filing  
Efficacy  and  safety  data  that  supported  a  conditional  approval  in  the  EU  of  Ocaliva  included  three 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, international studies in patients with PBC:  
•  Study 747-201 was a Phase 2, 3-month, international, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-
group study in patients with a proven or likely diagnosis of PBC who were suboptimally controlled. 
In this study, OCA doses of 10 mg and 50 mg were evaluated as monotherapies.  
•  Study 747-202 was a Phase 2, 3-month, international, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-
group study in patients with a proven or likely diagnosis of PBC who were suboptimally controlled. 
OCA doses of 10 mg, 25 mg, and 50 mg were evaluated as add-on therapy to UDCA, the current 
standard of care for PBC.  
•  Study 747-301 was the pivotal Phase 3, 12-month, international, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
study in patients with a proven or likely diagnosis of PBC who were suboptimally controlled. In this 
study, OCA doses evaluated were 10 mg or a titration approach (i.e., 5 mg for the initial 6 months, 
with uptitration to 10 mg for the last 6 months if the patient did not meet the primary composite 
endpoint and had no tolerability issues).  
Studies 747-201, 747-202, and 747-301 included open-label, uncontrolled, LTSE phases to evaluate the 
long-term effects of OCA treatment. For the initial marketing authorization application (MAA), the LTSEs 
of Studies 747-201 and 747-202 were completed, while the LTSE for 747-301 remained ongoing.  
An additional, 8-week, open-label study was also included in the initial MAA filing; however, efficacy data 
from this study was not integrated with Studies 747-201, 747-202, and 747-301 due to differences in 
study design and endpoints:  
•  Study  747-205  assessed  the  safety,  tolerability,  and  PD  effects  of  OCA  on  HDLc  metabolism  in 
patients with PBC on a stable dose of UDCA. This study included an LSTE which was completed after 
the initial marketing authorization.  
New Data to Support Fulfilment of Specific Obligations of the CMA and PAES  
Efficacy and safety data to support fulfilment of the requirements of the Specific Obligations of the CMA 
and support the grant of a Marketing Authorization without conditions include completed postmarketing 
requirement (PMR)/SOB/PAER studies in patients with PBC included the following:  
•  Study 747-401 was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study evaluating the PK and 
safety of OCA in patients with PBC and moderate to severe hepatic impairment.  
•  Study 747-302 was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study designed to 
prospectively obtain evidence to confirm clinical benefit and further evaluate the benefit-risk profile 
of OCA treatment in patients with PBC.  
In addition to Studies 747-401 and 747-302, the LTSE of Study 747-301 is completed and provides long-
term  durability  and  safety  data  of  OCA  for  up  to  6  years  (with  median  exposure  of  5.3  years  in  193 
patients).  
The SOB studies provide primary evidence characterizing the safety and efficacy of OCA in patients with 
PBC  and  are  supplemented  by  three  real-world  evidence  (RWE)  studies  evaluating  analyses  of 
hepatic clinical outcomes (i.e., time to death, liver transplant and hepatic decompensation) to provide 
supplementary evidence in this data package. These studies include:

• 
The  747-301/301 LTSE  external control  (EC)  analysis  was  conducted  in  OCA-treated  patients 
from  Study  747-301/301  LTSE  compared  to  external-weighted  controls  (Global  PBC  and  United 
Kingdom  [UK]  PBC  Registries)  consisting  of  PBC  patients  who  had  failed  UDCA  but  had  not  been 
prescribed  Ocaliva  from  the  Global  PBC  Registry).  As  UK-PBC  only  analyzed  only  death  and  liver 
transplant  (and  not  hepatic  decompensation),  the  efficacy  results  in  Section  4.2.3  are  based  on 
Global PBC only, which evaluated the primary composite endpoint of time to death, liver transplant 
or hepatic decompensation.  
• 
The 747-302 EC analysis was conducted in OCA-treated patients in Study 747-302 compared to 
external-weighted controls from the Komodo Health US Claims database consisting of PBC patients 
who  had  failed  UDCA  or  discontinued  UDCA  for  3  or  more  months  but  had  not  been  prescribed 
Ocaliva. Both guidelines and the standard of care in PBC in the EU are similar to those in the US, 
supporting the relevance of these data for EU patients with PBC.  
•  Study 747-405 is a  fully RWE study that compared the incidence of hepatic clinical outcomes in 
patients  with  PBC  initiating  Ocaliva  to  a  standardized  mortality/morbidity  ratio  (SMR)-weighted 
control group of patients with PBC who would otherwise be eligible for, but who are not prescribed, 
Ocaliva.  Administrative  US  claims  data  linked  (Komodo  Health  US  Claims  database)  to  additional 
data sources were used. The MAH states that these US data are relevant to European patients with 
PBC  because  US  diagnostic  criteria,  patient  demographics,  and  treatment  patterns  for  PBC  are 
similar.  
A  summary  of  the  clinical  development  program  for  OCA  in  the  treatment  of  patients  with  PBC  and 
supporting real-world evidence in patients with PBC is summarized in Figure 1. 
The chronology of studies conducted postmarketing authorization to support fulfilment of the SOBs for 
conditional approval is presented in Figure 2.  
Of  note,  during  the  conduct  of  Studies  747-401  and  747-302,  the  EU  SmPC  was  updated  (Variation 
submitted  01  Jul  2021  and  EC  approved  24  Jun  2022)  to  include  a  contraindication  in  patients  with 
decompensated cirrhosis (e.g., CP- B or C) or a prior decompensation event. At the time of submission, 
for Study 747-302, the Sponsor discontinued investigational product in all patients with decompensated 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 14/319 
 
  
 
 
 
liver cirrhosis globally and additionally, excluded patients with compensated cirrhosis and evidence of 
portal hypertension in the US. A total of 21% of patients enrolled in Study 747-302 met the criteria for 
contraindication per SmPC.  
The  MAH  terminated  Study  747-401  as  the  study  enrolled  patients  with  moderate  or  severe  hepatic 
impairment  (n=22),  all  of  whom  had  decompensated  liver  disease;  following  the  SmPC  restriction 
update, the study was no longer relevant.  
In summary: 
• Registrational study and long-term safety extension (LTSE) − Study 747-301 LTSE   
• European Union (EU) specific obligations (SOBs) and post marketing requirement (PMR) 
− Study 747-401   
− Study 747-302  
• Supportive real-world evidence (RWE) Studies − Studies 747-301 EC, 747-302 EC, and 747-405. 
6.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
Study 747-301 was the Phase 3, 12-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to meet 
requirements of accelerated approval in the US and conditional marketing approval via the EU 
centralized procedure based on establishing a reduction in serum ALP. Following the 12-month double-

blind, placebo-controlled period of Study 747-301, patients randomized to placebo crossed over to OCA 
treatment and all patients were followed for up to an additional 5 years (747-301 LTSE). 
Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Study 747-301 LTSE (uncontrolled study) 
Study 747-301 was the Phase 3, 12-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to support accelerated 
approval based on establishing a reduction in serum ALP. Following the 12-month double-blind, placebo-
controlled period of Study 747-301, all patients, including those who received placebo, were eligible to 
participate in an open-label LTSE and were followed for up to an additional 5 years (747-301 LTSE). The 
Month 12 Visit from the Double-Blind Phase served as the Day 1 Visit of the LTSE Phase as shown in the 
figure below. 
Key study design aspects of 747-301 LTSE included: 
•  Patient treatment allocation in the Double-Blind Phase was not made available until the entire study 
was unblinded. Accordingly, all patients starting in the LTSE Phase were initially started on the 5 mg 
dose, i.e., patients who received placebo started OCA therapy, those already on 5 mg continued on 
the same dose, while those who received 10 mg at the end of the Double-Blind Phase were titrated 
down to 5 mg. Using this approach, blinding of the entire study was maintained and data on the 
effects of down titrating from 10 mg to 5 mg were also obtained. 
•  All patients continued at a 5 mg dose for a minimum of 3 months. Subsequent to the LTSE Month 3 
visit, OCA doses could be titrated (incrementally from 5 mg to 10 mg to 15 mg, up to 25 mg OCA at 
a  frequency  of  no  more  than  one  up-titration  every  3  months).  However,  effective  with  Protocol 
Version 5 (21 Mar 2018), the protocol was amended to align with marketing doses (i.e., 5 mg or 10 
mg once daily). Any patient receiving a dose higher than 10 mg was down titrated to ≤10 mg daily. 
•  Any of the patients who had a clinically significant therapeutic response during the LTSE Phase could 
have had their UDCA withdrawn if determined clinically appropriate by the Investigator. Patients who 
received investigational product as a monotherapy in the Double-Blind Phase were to receive OCA 
as a monotherapy in the LTSE Phase.

Results 
747-301 LTSE - Study Population 
A total of 217 patients were enrolled into the 12-month double-blind phase of the study; of the 198 
patients who completed the double-blind phase, 193 patients (97.5%) enrolled into the LTSE phase. 
Overall, there was good retention in the study: 146 (76%) patients completed the protocol as specified 
following administrative termination/closure of the study, and 47 (24%) patients discontinued the 
LTSE prematurely. The majority of patients discontinued due to study closure by the Sponsor. Twenty 
(10%) patients discontinued due to an AE (either pruritus or other AE), and 12 (6%) patients withdrew 
consent. Two patients (one during the study and another after the study was closed) died during the 
LTSE; both deaths were considered by the Investigator as unrelated to OCA. 
For the total population, the mean age was 55.4 years, with a range from 29 to 83 years. A total of 
83% of patients were <65 years of age. As expected with PBC, the study population was 
predominantly female (92%) and white (94%). The majority (93%) of the population was on UDCA at 
baseline. In general, key demographic and PBC baseline disease characteristics were well balanced 
across weighted average daily dose (WADD) categories. 
747-301 LTSE - Efficacy Summary 
The efficacy associated with continued treatment with OCA was durable and consistent with the effects 
observed in the double-blind phase. For patients originally randomized to OCA, continued treatment 
was associated with sustained improvements in liver biochemistry. For patients originally randomized 
to placebo, there were clinically significant improvements in liver biochemistry following the initiation 
of OCA nearly identical to the changes observed in patients randomized to OCA in the double-blind 
phase. Specifically, long-term treatment with OCA, upto 6 years in patients with PBC resulted in 
clinically meaningful improvements as assessed by the primary efficacy endpoint—the composite ALP 
and total bilirubin endpoint that supported initial approval of OCA for the treatment of PBC. In addition, 
improvements in markers of cholestasis (ALP and GGT) and hepatocellular injury (ALT and AST) were 
observed along with improvement or no worsening of histologic fibrosis. Total bilirubin levels remained 
stable and within the normal range throughout the duration of the study (see Section 5 for durability of 
liver biochemistry over time). Improvements in markers of fibrosis and apoptosis observed during the 
double-blind phase were all maintained with long-term treatment. 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 17/319 
 
  
 
 
A biopsy substudy (n=17) was performed in patients assessing baseline biopsies (up to 1 year before 
the start of the double-blind phase) and after 3 years of OCA treatment (LTSE Month 24 for OCA 
randomized patients and LTSE Month 36 for placebo randomized patients) (Bowlus 2020). Overall, the 
results of the post hoc reanalysis were indicative that long-term OCA treatment in patients with PBC is 
associated with improvement or stabilization across a spectrum of histologic features of PBC. 
747-301 LTSE - Safety Summary 
Overall, administration of OCA was safe and generally well tolerated over the 5-year LTSE phase in 
patients with PBC; the safety profile during the LTSE phase was similar to that in the double-blind 
phase as well as other PBC studies with OCA, and no new safety signals were noted. 
A total of 193 patients received at least 1 dose of OCA during the LTSE. The median number of days on 
OCA was 1944.0 days (5.3 years) from initiation of OCA regardless if it were in the double-blind or 
LTSE phase. The median weighted average daily OCA dose was 8.3 mg. Forty-two (22%) patients 
received OCA >10 mg daily at some point during the study. 
The most common treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was pruritus. With the exception of 
pruritus, diarrhea, and dyspepsia, the distribution of TEAEs was generally similar across weighted 
average daily dose (WADD) categories, and most TEAEs were considered resolved at the end of the 
LTSE. There was a dose-related pattern of pruritus across WADD categories, and most patients 
experienced TEAEs of pruritus that were mild or moderate in severity. Pruritus frequency and severity 
remained steady after approximately 3 months of OCA treatment. 
Overall, 61 (32%) patients experienced a serious TEAE. There was no apparent pattern to the types of 
serious TEAEs nor dose-relationship of serious TEAEs across WADD categories. The majority of serious 
TEAEs were considered not related to OCA. Two (1%) deaths occurred during the LTSE (one was 
attributed to sepsis complications from a heart valve replacement and the other was due to jaundice 
associated with acute alcohol hepatitis); and both deaths were assessed as unrelated to OCA. 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 18/319 
 
  
 
 
 
The hepatic-related safety was consistent with that reported in previous studies with OCA, and no new 
findings were noted following long-term treatment with OCA. Markers of liver injury and cholestasis 
improved with long-term OCA treatment. 
Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol remained unchanged with long-term OCA treatment and the 
modest decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol observed during the double-blind phase 
plateaued during the LTSE phase, with median values remaining above the LLN. 
747-301 LTSE - Overall Conclusions (as provided by the MAH) 
•  The efficacy associated with continued treatment with OCA was durable and consistent with the 
effects observed in the double-blind phase. 
•  The safety profile remained consistent with the known safety profile of OCA in patients with PBC, 
with no new safety signals apparent with long-term treatment. 
•  Overall, these findings support the long-term efficacy and safety of OCA treatment for patients 
with PBC who are intolerant or inadequately responsive to UDCA. 
Discussion 
Only top line LTSE results have been provided, which do not allow to formally assess and conclude on 
the long-term safety of Ocaliva. Of note, 61 (32%) patients experienced a serious TEAE (according to 
the  MAH,  the  majority  not  considered  OCA  related),  and  a  substantial  proportion  (47/198  (24%))  of 
patients  discontinued  the  LTSE  prematurely:  20  (10%)  patients  discontinued  due  to  an  AE  (either 
pruritus or other AE), and 12 (6%) patients withdrew consent; although the reduction in ALP achieved 
with OCA appears to remain in the long-term, these data do not speak in favour of the claimed good 
tolerability  in  the  long-term,  also  considering  the  lack  of  alternative  treatment  options.  A  more 
comprehensive presentation of the relevant efficacy and safety results of this study was requested and 
provided. Overall, long term efficacy data support the maintenance of the effect of OCA treatment in 
liver biochemical and inflammatory parameters. A high proportion of patients had a severe TEAE (54%), 
and SAEs (32%), thought the overall rate of treatment discontinuation was relatively low (13%). The 
safety  profile  remains  unchanged,  with  pruritus  being  the  most  common  bothersome  TEAEs,  largely 
responsible for the severe TEAEs. CV (21%) and hepatic events (24%) were commonly reported during 
the trial, though the incidence of serious CV and hepatic events was relatively low (around 4% both), 
and most of these cases occurred in patients with underlying conditions or in whom treatment with OCA 
is currently contraindicated. Overall, these data do not raise major concerns, although the absence of a 
control arm does not allow drawing firm conclusions on the actual role of OCA in the incidence of these 
events.   
7.  Post-Authorisation efficacy study (PAES) results 
European Union Specific Obligations (EU SOBs) 
Studies 747-401 and 747-302 were imposed as a part of the accelerated approval of Ocaliva by FDA and 
SOBs imposed as a part of the Conditional Marketing Authorization (CMA) of Ocaliva in the EU.  
Study 747-401  
Study 747-401 was a Phase 4, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study evaluating the safety 
and pharmacokinetics (PK) of Ocaliva in patients with PBC and moderate to severe hepatic impairment. 
A total of 22 patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment were enrolled. Study 747-401 was 
terminated  upon  the  updates  to  the  Core  Company  Datasheet  (CCDS),  EU  Summary  of  Product 
EMA/528620/2023

Characteristics (SmPC), and the US Prescribing Information (USPI), with last-patient-last-visit on 09 Jul 
2021. As patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment are contraindicated per the revised EU 
SmPC, the data from this study are of limited value to prescribers for Ocaliva in PBC.  
Study 747-302  
Study  747-302  was  a  Phase  3b/4,  double-blind,  randomized,  placebo-controlled,  multicenter  study 
evaluating the effect of OCA on clinical outcomes in patients with PBC to confirm clinical outcomes with 
Ocaliva  as  required  in  multiple  jurisdictions.  Both  Committee  for  Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use 
(CHMP) and FDA provided input into the design of Study 747-302, and per requirements, Study 747-
302 was ongoing at the time of marketing authorizations.  
The primary objective of the study was to assess the effects of OCA compared to placebo, in conjunction 
with  established  local  standard  of  care,  on  clinical  outcomes  in  patients  with  PBC  as  derived  as  a 
composite event endpoint (defined below).  
Most patients enrolled into Study 747-302 were at a more advanced disease stage compared to Study 
747-301  and  only  a  subpopulation  of  patients  (79%)  reflected  the  currently  indicated  (e.g.,  with 
compensated cirrhosis) population in the revised EU SmPC.  
Study  747-302  encountered  enrolment  and  retention  challenges,  which  were  discussed  on  several 
occasions with both FDA and CHMP. The Sponsor proposed a transition to an open-label design versus 
historic  control;  however,  at  the  time  of  the  CHMP  Positive  Opinion  in  October  2016,  CHMP  explicitly 
required that no analysis utilizing an external control be conducted without advanced agreement from 
regulators.  
In  alignment  with  the  FDA  and  EMA  and  upon  recommendation  from  the  Data  Monitoring  Committee 
(DMC), the Sponsor decided to terminate Study 747-302 early due to feasibility challenges in the setting 
of  commercially  available  Ocaliva,  with  last-patient-last-visit  on  23  Dec  2021.  The  study  was  under-
powered to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.6 for the original primary composite endpoint of death, liver 
transplant, or hepatic decompensation. At the time of study termination by the Sponsor, approximately 
67%  of  the  clinical  events  had  been  observed  of  the  total  estimated  to  provide  80%  power  to 
demonstrate a statistically significant difference in clinical progression between OCA and placebo.  
To better evaluate the benefit-risk ratio, the composite endpoint was expanded in alignment with FDA 
to  include  additional  components  that  occur  earlier  in  the  progression  of  PBC.  The  revised  expanded 
endpoint from FDA was not agreed by CHMP. It was requested that the Sponsor continue assessing the 
composite  endpoint  as  originally  defined  in  the  protocol  and  described  in  the  statistical  analysis  plan 
(SAP).  The  resulting  difference  in  feedback  from  EMA  and  FDA  on  the  composite  endpoint  led  to  the 
Sponsor analyzing both endpoints. 
Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Study 747-401 (double-blind, placebo-controlled)  
As outlined above, study 747-401 was a Phase 3b/4, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 
study evaluating the safety and PK of Ocaliva in patients with PBC and moderate to severe hepatic 
impairment. Efficacy was considered as a secondary objective. Patients with definite or probable PBC 
and Child-Pugh Class B (CP-B) or Child-Pugh Class C (CP-C) cirrhosis with Model for End Stage Liver 
Disease (MELD) scores of 6 to 24 were enrolled in the study.  
Enrolled patients who met all eligibility requirements were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 
treatment groups: placebo or OCA at Screening and Day 1. The study included a Double-Blind 
Treatment Phase of 48 weeks, followed by a Double-Blind Extension Phase (see figure below).  
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 20/319 
 
  
 
 
Study 747-401 was terminated upon the EU SmPC update in 2021, with last-patient-last-visit on 09 Jul 
2021. A total of 22 patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment were enrolled. As patients 
with moderate or severe hepatic impairment are contraindicated per the revised EU SmPC, the data 
from this study are of limited value to prescribers for Ocaliva in PBC.  
Study design  
Key study aspects of Study 747-401 included the following:  
•  A 48-week study designed to characterize the PK and safety of OCA in patients with PBC with 
moderate to severe hepatic impairment.  
•  PK and safety parameters were evaluated as primary objectives. Efficacy parameters were 
evaluated as secondary and additional objectives.  
•  Study site personnel, patients, and the Sponsor were blinded to treatment allocations.  
•  Based on results from previous Phase 1 and 2 studies, doses of OCA administered to patients with 
moderate or severe hepatic impairment should be lower than those for patients with normal 
hepatic function to achieve similar hepatic exposure.  
•  All patients initiated investigational product once weekly with OCA 5 mg or matching placebo. At 
Week 12, if the investigational product was tolerated and laboratory assessments did not indicate a 
safety concern, the patient could be up titrated to OCA 5 mg twice weekly and no earlier than 2 
days after they took their last dose. Following titration, dosing was to occur at least 3 days apart. 
Every 6 weeks thereafter, based on tolerability assessments, patients could be considered for 
further up titration.  
•  There was no primary efficacy endpoint in the study; data were described under clinical outcome 
events efficacy endpoints and additional efficacy endpoints. The study was not designed to detect 
differences between treatments for efficacy endpoints.  
•  Missing data for patients were considered as non-informative missing data and were not imputed.  
Study 747-302 (double-blind, placebo-controlled)  
Study 747-302 was a Phase 3b/4, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study 
evaluating the effect of OCA on clinical outcomes in patients with PBC to confirm clinical outcomes with 
Ocaliva. Most patients enrolled into Study 747-302 were more advanced disease stage (i.e., higher risk

for liver-related clinical complications) compared to previous studies and only a subpopulation of 
patients is reflective of the compensated population in the revised SmPC.  
Study design  
With the exception of liver transplant or death, if a patient experienced a suspected or confirmed 
clinical outcomes event, the patient may have continued the regular visit schedule and taking 
investigational product as long as the patient had not met any of the criteria for discontinuation 
including:  
• 
• 
• 
Patient began treatment with commercially available OCA.  
The Investigator or Sponsor considered that it was advisable or in the best interest of the patient.  
The occurrence of clinical or laboratory AEs considered by the Investigator to be clinically 
important safety concerns and related to investigational product.  
•  Withdrawal of consent  
Patients who discontinued investigational product were expected to be followed through to study 
closure (or at the discretion of the Sponsor).  
Discussions with both FDA and CHMP regarding recruitment and retention challenges with Study 747-
302 occurred from 2019 until study termination. The transition to an open-label design versus historic 
control was proposed previously, although at the time of the CHMP Positive Opinion in October 2016, 
CHMP explicitly required deletion of reference to the use of a historic control as exploratory endpoint 
analysis in the study protocol.  
Rationale for Study Design  
Study 747-302 was a clinical outcomes study, designed to confirm the clinical benefit of OCA treatment 
in patients with PBC. Data from a retrospective observational database of patients with PBC (Global 
PBC Study Group) were utilized to inform the design of Study 747-302.  
Patient Eligibility  
Given the low prevalence of PBC, combined with the slow but inevitable progression of the disease, the 
study was designed to balance scientific rigor with feasibility of execution. Hence, the 747-302 study 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 22/319 
 
  
 
 
 
 
population purposely recruited more advanced PBC patients compared to the Study 747-301 
population that served as the basis for accelerated/conditional approval.  
Patient eligibility required a diagnosis of PBC with bilirubin levels >ULN and ≤5x ULN and/or ALP levels 
>3x ULN, which were tested twice during the screening period. Enrolled patients were randomized in a 
1:1 ratio across sites and were stratified by UDCA treatment (yes/no) and baseline bilirubin categories 
(>ULN/≤ULN), as specified by the central laboratory. A minimum of 30% of patients were required to 
have elevated bilirubin at Screening.  
Rationale for Dose  
In Phase 2 studies, OCA 10 mg demonstrated equivalent efficacy to OCA 25 mg and 50 mg with better 
tolerability. Study 747-301 demonstrated that titration from OCA 5 mg to OCA 10 mg based on clinical 
response improved tolerance, minimized dropouts due to pruritus, and showed comparable efficacy to 
OCA 10 mg after 1 year. Thus, in alignment with the EU SmPC, the dosing regimen for all 747-302 
study patients initially was OCA 5 mg once daily with titration to OCA 10 mg once daily at 6 months, if 
tolerated. Following Protocol Version 3.0 dated 07 Sep 2016, dose and frequency were modified 
according to the SmPC for patients with CP-B or CP-C cirrhosis; these patients are now contraindicated 
in the current EU SmPC.  
Determination of Sample Size  
The following assumptions were used for sample size calculations:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
Exponential survival curves, placebo survival estimate of 0.6 at 8 years with a HR of 0.60, and 
total study duration of 10 years (from first patient enrolled), allowing for 4 years of patient accrual 
and 6 years of follow up.  
Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to placebo or OCA.  
The two treatment groups were compared using a 2-sided log rank test at the 5% level of 
significance.  
Two interim analyses and one final analysis were planned, with interim analyses to occur after the 
accrual of 50% and 75% of clinical outcome events, respectively.  
•  A dropout rate equally distributed between treatment arms of 10% was assumed.  
Based on the randomization ratio, significance level, and assumed HR, a total of 127 events (both 
groups combined) was to provide 80% power to demonstrate a statistically significant difference 
between OCA and placebo on time to liver-related outcomes, including all-cause mortality.  
In addition, based on the remaining assumptions stated above, it was estimated that approximately 
428 patients would be enrolled to attain 127 events.  
Sample size calculations were based on the following composite endpoint: time to first occurrence of 
death, liver transplant, MELD ≥15, uncontrolled ascites, or hospitalization for new onset or recurrence 
of variceal bleed, hepatic encephalopathy, or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.  
Due to enrolment challenges and difficulties to keep patients in the study, and in alignment with the 
FDA, EMA, and the recommendations of the DMC, the study was terminated early by the Sponsor. To 
better evaluate the benefit-risk ratio, the primary composite endpoint was revised in alignment with 
FDA to include additional components that occur earlier in the progression of PBC (referred to as 
expanded primary endpoint). The revised expanded endpoint from FDA was not agreed by CHMP. It 
was requested that the Sponsor continue assessing the composite endpoint as originally defined in the 
protocol and assessed in the SAP. The resulting difference in feedback from EMA and FDA on the 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 23/319 
 
  
 
 
composite endpoint led to the Sponsor analyzing both endpoints as described in the clinical study 
report and elsewhere.  
Duration of Treatment  
The study was event driven and total duration was determined on the time required to accrue 
approximately 127 adjudicated primary endpoint events (based on the assumed HR of 0.6 and to 
provide 80% power), estimated to be approximately 10 years. Patients were expected to have a 
minimum follow-up time of approximately 6 years.  
Primary Endpoint  
Per the most recent protocol at the time of database lock (Version 6), the primary analysis was a log 
rank test comparing the OCA-treated arm to the placebo arm on time to first occurrence of an 
adjudicated event in the composite endpoint (referred to as primary composite endpoint) as 
summarized in the table below.  
Definition of Primary Composite Endpoint 
Expanded Primary Endpoint  
Due to enrollment and retention challenges, and in alignment with the FDA, EMA and on 
recommendation of the DMC, the study was terminated early by the Sponsor, with approximately 67% 
of the protocol-specified number of events necessary to provide 80% power to demonstrate a 
statistically significant difference between OCA and placebo (84 adjudicated Protocol Version 6 
endpoints observed), with 171 (51.2%) patients actively on study at time of Sponsor termination. To 
increase the number of endpoint events and power to detect a difference between treatment arms, the 
primary efficacy endpoint was expanded based on recommendation from the FDA, to include:  
• 
• 
• 
Portal hypertension syndromes (hepatorenal, portopulmonary, or hepatopulmonary)  
Progression to decompensated liver disease (for patients without decompensation at baseline)  
Progression to clinical evidence of portal hypertension without decompensation (for patients 
without decompensation or clinical evidence of portal hypertension at baseline)  
A detailed definition of the expanded composite endpoint is presented in the following table. 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 24/319 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Definition of Expanded Primary Endpoint 
The primary efficacy analysis remained the stratified log rank test. With the inclusion of additional 
endpoints that occurred earlier in the course of the disease, the log rank test was limited to each 
patient’s first event, which was likely to be an outcome of lesser clinical importance.  
As noted in the CHMP/PRAC 2021 annual renewal assessment report (EMEA/H/C/004093/R/0027), 
CHMP did not agree to the proposed changes to the primary endpoint.  
Number of Interim Analyses  
Although the protocol did originally plan for 2 interim analyses, one at ~50% (64 events) and the 
other at ~75% (96 events) information fraction, the first interim analysis was postponed to after 
regulatory authority review of the interim SAP. As a result, the first interim analysis occurred after the 
accrual of approximately 65% (83 events) of the required total clinical outcome events. It was agreed 
that the second interim analysis would be omitted. O’Brien-Fleming Boundaries were used for 
superiority in the interim analysis. The table below provides the relevant estimates both for the original 
2-interim analyses and revised single-interim analysis scenarios.

Results 
Study 747-401: A Phase 4, Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Study Evaluating 
the Pharmacokinetics and Safety of Obeticholic Acid in Patients with Primary Biliary 
Cholangitis and Moderate to Severe Hepatic Impairment  
Patients  with  moderate  or  severe  hepatic  impairment  are  contraindicated  per  the  revised  EU  SmPC; 
therefore, the data from this study are of limited value to prescribers for Ocaliva in PBC.  
747-401 - Study Population  
A total of 22 patients were randomized in the study (10 patients in the OCA group and 12 in the placebo 
group) and comprised the Randomized, ITT, and Safety populations. Of these, 10 (45.5%) patients (6 
patients in the OCA group and 4 patients in the placebo group) completed the Double-Blind Phase. The 
majority of patients were White (95.5%) and female (72.7%). The median age of patients was 63 (range: 
45 to 79 years old).  
In  general,  baseline  characteristics,  including  Child-Pugh  (CP)  and  MELD  scores,  were  well  balanced 
across treatment arms. The majority of patients had CP Class B (100.0% [OCA] and 91.7% [placebo]) 
whereas 0.0% (OCA) and 8.3% (placebo) patients had CP Class C. Mean (SD) Baseline CP score was 7.7 
(0.67) in the OCA and 7.9 (0.90) in the placebo groups. Mean (SD) Baseline MELD score was 12.7 (3.47) 
in  the  OCA  and  12.4  (2.97)  in  the  placebo  groups.  The  mean  (SD)  age  at  time  of  consent  was  60.5 
(10.19) years in the OCA and 62.5 (9.10) years in the placebo groups, and the percentage of females 
was 60.0% (OCA) and 83.3% (placebo).  
747-401 - Safety Summary  
In the Double-Blind Phase and Double-Blind Extension Phase, the overall mean duration of exposure to 
study  treatment  was  296.5  days  in  the  OCA  and  233.4  days  in  the  placebo  groups.  In  the  Safety 
Population, all patients in the OCA and placebo groups reported at least 1 TEAE during the Double-Blind 
Phase  and  Double-Blind  Extension  Phase  of  the  study.  The  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  (≥  30%) 
were  ascites,  oesophageal  varices  haemorrhage,  pneumonia,  urinary  tract  infection,  pruritus,  and 
anaemia.  
The majority of TEAEs in both treatment groups were reported to be mild (Grade 1) or moderate (Grade 
2) in severity.  
Study treatment or study discontinuations occurred in 5 (50.0%) patients in the OCA and 5 (41.7%) in 
the placebo groups and study treatment interruptions occurred in 5 (50.0%) patients in the OCA and 4 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 26/319 
 
  
 
 
 
(33.3%) patients in the placebo group. The most common TEAE leading to study treatment interruption 
was ascites (2 [20.0%] patients in OCA and 1 [8.3%] in placebo groups).  
A total of 7 (70.0%) patients in the OCA and 9 (75.0%) patients in the placebo groups experienced 
serious adverse events (SAEs). In general, the nature of SAEs is consistent with the underlying 
advanced liver disease in this patient population.  
A total of 5 deaths were reported (3 patients in the placebo group [hepatic encephalopathy, aortic 
aneurysm rupture, and clear cell renal carcinoma] and 2 patients in the OCA group [multiple organ 
dysfunction syndrome and cardiac arrest]), which were all considered by the Investigator as not 
related or unlikely related to the study treatment. The case of death from clear cell renal cell 
carcinoma occurred within the study period; however, was reported after database lock.  
Overall, 9 (90.0%) patients in the OCA and 9 (75.0%) patients in the placebo groups experienced an 
adverse event of special interest (AESI).  
Overall, no patients had clinically relevant abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) findings at Week 48 or 
Double-Blind Extension Month 12 across treatment groups.  
Several mean baseline laboratory values were out of range, consistent with patients with PBC with 
moderate to advanced cirrhosis. These values did not change meaningfully over time following multiple 
dose administration of OCA or placebo; additionally, no meaningful discernible differences over time 
were noted between OCA and placebo.  
There were no clinically relevant changes from baseline (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and 
weight) in OCA group compared with placebo. No additional physical examination findings were 
observed, and no trends were detected.  
747-401 – PK Summary  
Six patients with hepatic impairment (CP-B) were included in the PK analysis: 6 patients received OCA 
5 mg once weekly, of which 4 patients were titrated to 5 mg twice weekly and of the 4 patients, 2 
patients were titrated to 10 mg twice weekly. No patients with severe hepatic impairment (CP-C) were 
evaluable for PK assessment.  
The PK results of this study demonstrated the accuracy of the simulation to predict total OCA exposure 
following the OCA 5 mg once weekly dose regimen. The observed mean area under the plasma 
concentration time curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUC0-24h) for total OCA at Week 12 (i.e., steady-state) 
was 2970 ng∙h/mL comparable to the simulated predicted mean AUC0-24h of 2633 ng∙h/mL (data on 
file), which is comparable to the observed total OCA exposure (AUC0-24h = 2762 ng∙h/mL) following a 
10 mg daily dose in patients without hepatic impairment. Based on these PK results, the initial dose of 
OCA 5 mg once weekly achieved targeted OCA exposure. Dose proportional increases in total OCA 
exposure were observed with dose titration from 5 mg once weekly to 5 mg twice weekly and 10 mg 
twice weekly.  
747-401 – Efficacy Summary  
Study 747-401 was not designed to detect differences in efficacy. OCA demonstrated no clear clinical 
benefit in this advanced PBC population (CP-B or CP-C) who is considered contraindicated per the EU 
SmPC. No clinically meaningful differences were noted between OCA versus placebo for the composite 
outcome of death, including liver-related death, liver transplant, MELD, uncontrolled ascites, and 
hospitalizations for decompensating events. There was also no significant difference between OCA and 
placebo for individual components of the composite outcome, except for variceal bleeding (unclear 
relevance given the small sample size).  
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 27/319 
 
  
 
 
There was a trend toward improving liver stiffness measurement (LSM) over time among OCA versus 
placebo, however, because of the small sample size and a large standard error of the mean (SEM) the 
significance of this observation is unclear. Overall, change and percent change in liver stiffness (as 
assessed by TE) and enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) were not statistically different than placebo.  
Overall changes in total bile acids, total endogenous bile acids, fibroblast growth factor-19 (FGF-19) 
and 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4) concentrations were observed in the OCA group over time, 
however, were not clinically significant at any timepoint. Interpretation of these results is limited due 
to the small sample size and the study was not designed to detect outcome differences.  
Overall Conclusions (as provided by the MAH) 
• 
The safety profile of OCA was consistent with that expected in a PBC patient population with 
moderate to advanced cirrhosis.  
•  Despite the low patient numbers for PK assessment (N=6), total OCA exposure following OCA 5 mg 
once weekly was consistent with the modelled predictions of AUC0-24h and maximum plasma 
concentration (Cmax) demonstrating that the modified OCA dose regimen of 5 mg once weekly 
achieved targeted OCA exposure.  
•  No clinically meaningful differences were noted between OCA and placebo for efficacy endpoints, 
though the number of patients was small, and the study was not designed to detect differences 
between treatment groups.  
Study 747-302: A Phase 4, Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Multicenter Study 
Evaluating the Effect of Obeticholic Acid on Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Primary 
Biliary Cholangitis 
747-302 – Study Population 
A  total  of  334  patients  were  randomized  in  the  study  and  were  included  in  the  ITT  Population:  168 
patients in the OCA and 166 patients in the placebo groups. 
Treatment groups were well balanced for each key demographic variable. The majority of patients were 
female (90%) and White (87%). Overall, the mean age of patients was 53.7 (range: 29 to 77 years old). 
A total of 84% of patients were <65 years of age. 
The study population had advanced disease consistent with the study inclusion criteria of a diagnosis of 
PBC  with  bilirubin  levels  >ULN  and  ≤5x  ULN  and/or  ALP  >3x  ULN.  The  majority  of  patients  were 
compensated at baseline (265 [79%] patients) versus decompensated (69 [21%] patients). 
747-302 - Efficacy Summary 
The estimated effect of treatment from the ITT analyses, shown below, was under-powered (due to 
incomplete recruitment and the prespecified number of endpoints not achieved) and potentially biased 
(due to differential drop out and quality of follow up) resulting in difficulties in the interpretation of the 
tests of hypotheses for the primary, expanded primary, and key secondary endpoints.

Kaplan-Meier Time to First Occurrence of Composite Primary Endpoint – (ITT Population) 
The MAH argues that several factors impacted the assessment of treatment effect including: 
• 
In  alignment  with  the  FDA  and  EMA  and  upon  recommendation  from  the  DMC,  the  Sponsor 
terminated Study 747-302 early due to feasibility challenges in the setting of commercially available 
Ocaliva. 
• 
In 2021, the EU SmPC was revised to contraindicated use of OCA in patients with decompensated 
cirrhosis (e.g., CP Class B or C) or a prior decompensation event. A total of 21% of patients enrolled 
in Study 747-302 prior to this revision met the contraindication criteria at screening and thus, would 
have not been eligible to receive commercial Ocaliva per the updated SmPC. 
•  At the time of study termination by the Sponsor, the study had randomized less than 80% of planned 
enrolment (i.e., 334 of the targeted 428 patients) and approximately 67% of the protocol-specified 
number of clinical events had been observed. 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 29/319 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Sensitivity  analyses  and  subgroup  analyses  for  the  primary,  expanded  primary,  and  key  secondary 
endpoints, and baseline and demographic subgroup analyses were consistent with the results observed 
in the Overall Population based on ITT analyses.  
The  table  below  include  the  results  of  some  of  the  conducted  sensitivity  analyses  of  Time  to  First 
Occurrence of Primary Clinical Outcome Event (in the ITT population).  
In addition, a sensitivity analysis of the Time to First Occurrence of Primary Clinical Outcome Event in 
the per protocol (PP) population was also provided. See table below. 
Patients  with  earlier  stage  PBC  (i.e.,  compensated)  were  less  likely  to  experience  an  endpoint  than 
advanced stage PBC at baseline (i.e., decompensated).

Compensated vs Decompensated Subpopulations (ITT Analyses) 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 30/319 
 
  
 
 
  
 
Analyses  for  the  key  secondary  endpoints,  including  time  to  the  first  occurrence  of:  1)  the  primary 
endpoint; 2) severe decompensating events of the expanded primary endpoint; or 3) liver transplant or 
death (all-cause) were consistent with the results observed in the ITT analyses. 
Analyses for death or other individual event outcomes (liver transplant, first occurrence of hospitalization 
event, uncontrolled or refractory ascites, MELD score ≥15, development of varix/varices, or liver related 
death) were summarized and consistent with the results observed in the ITT primary analyses. 
As prespecified in the SAP, analyses of changes in liver biochemistry at each visit through Month 24 were 
compared between treatment groups using a restricted MMRM.  Consistent with previous PBC studies, 
OCA treatment was associated with greater mean (SE) reductions in total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, ALP, 
GGT, ALT, and AST over time, compared to placebo up to Month 24. Statistically significant least square 
(LS) mean (SE) differences (OCA – placebo) in change from baseline were at Month 24 based on nominal 
p-values for ALP (p=0.039), ALT (p=0.028), AST (p=0.026), and albumin (p=0.010). 
Patients in the OCA group showed improvements in several prognostic endpoints (MELD score, MELD-
Na score, CP score, and Mayo Risk Score) that are predictive of clinical outcomes for chronic liver disease. 
The  median  difference  (OCA-placebo)  (SE,  p-value)  at  Month  24  and  Month  36  for  MELD  were  -0.40 
(0.230, p=0.037) and -0.70 (0.357, p=0.026), respectively. The median difference (OCA-placebo) (SE) 
at  Month  24  and  Month  36  for  MELD-Na  were  -1.0  (0.26,  p=0.051)  and  -1.0  (0.51,  p=0.028), 
respectively. Mean (SE) CP-score remained generally stable through Month 60. The median difference 
(OCA-placebo) (SE) at Month 12, Month 24, and Month 36 was 0. Mean (SE) MRS remained generally 
stable over time. The median difference (OCA – placebo) (SE, p-value) at Month 24 was -0.190 (0.099, 
p=0.032). 
The median difference (OCA – placebo) (SE, p-value) for liver stiffness change from baseline was -0.80 
(0.867, p=0.341), -2.00 (1.199, p=0.073), and -2.30 (1.531, p=0.153) at Month 12, Month 24, and 
Month 36, respectively. 
The median difference (OCA – placebo) (SE, p-value) for ELF change from baseline was -0.10 (0.102, 
p=0.218), -0.30 (0.153, p=0.034), and -0.20 (0.179, p=0.373) at Month 12, Month 24, and Month 36, 
respectively. 
Various responder analyses were performed to assess improvement in ALP over time (e.g., reductions 
of ≥15%, ≥40%, or ≤ULN). A higher percentage of OCA-treated patients responded to each respective 
endpoint at each timepoint, compared with placebo-treated patients. 
A total of 21 (6.3%) of patients enrolled in Study 747-302 met the primary endpoint in the pivotal Phase 
3  Study  747-301  of  an  ALP  <1.67x  ULN  and  total  bilirubin  ≤ULN  and  ALP  decrease  from  baseline  of 
≥15%. A numerically greater percentage of patients in the OCA group (17/168 [10.1%]) achieved this 
endpoint  compared  to  placebo  (4/166  [2.4%]).  The  observed  HR  (95%  CI)  of  responders  to  non-
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 31/319 
 
  
 
 
 
responders was 0.23 (0.07, 0.72), with a nominal p-value=0.006, indicating responders were less likely 
to  experience  a  negative  outcome  based  on  the  expanded  primary  endpoint.  Further,  the  association 
between responder/non-responder status and outcomes was stronger in OCA-treated patients (observed 
HR [95% CI] of 0.19 [0.05, 0.78], with a nominal p-value=0.010) compared to placebo-treated patients 
(observed HR [95% CI] of 0.37 [0.05, 2.63], with a nominal p-value=0.297). 
Similar  patterns  were  observed  with  other  ALP-based  definitions  of  biochemical  responder/non-
responders  (Table  9),  with  OCA-treated  patients  seeing  a  stronger  association  between  biochemical 
response  and  outcomes  compared  to  placebo-treated  patients.  A  strong  association  between 
normalization of bilirubin at Month 12 and outcomes was observed in both treatment arms. 
747-302: Time to Event by Biochemical Response Criteria at Month 12 
Arguments provided by the MAH as to why drawing definitive efficacy conclusions from Study 747-302 
in the ITT analyses was challenging include the early termination of study, randomization of less than 
80% of planned enrolment, differential dropout between placebo and OCA groups, and OCA being 
commercially available to patients. The MAH argues that these challenges resulted in a failure to 
maintain equal distribution of background risk which may have influenced outcomes in a manner that 
favoured placebo and became more exaggerated as the study progressed. 
747-302 - Overall Conclusions (as provided by the MAH) 
•  Despite extensive efforts and multiple interactions with regulatory authorities, the Sponsor 
encountered several enrolment and retention challenges. In alignment with EMA, FDA, and DMC 
recommendations, Study 747-302 was terminated early. The study randomized less than 80% of 
planned enrolment. Upon completion of adjudication, 96 adjudicated endpoints were observed 
resulting in 76% of the protocol-specified number of events necessary to provide 80% power to 
demonstrate a statistically significant difference between OCA and placebo. 
•  Patients in Study 747-302 reflected an advanced disease population. While baseline demographics 
including duration of PBC were similar to previous PBC studies, patients in Study 747-302 had 
higher baseline ALP, total bilirubin, MELD, and Rotterdam criteria. Of the 334 patients in Study 
747-302, 21% were decompensated at enrolment. 
•  The estimated effect of treatment from the ITT analyses was under-powered and potentially biased 
resulting in difficulties in the interpretation of the tests of hypotheses for the primary and key 
secondary endpoints. 
•  No treatment difference was observed between OCA and placebo for either the primary endpoint or 
expanded primary endpoint, in the ITT analyses for the overall and compensated populations. 
Drawing definitive efficacy conclusions from Study 747-302 was challenging given the potential 
bias, particularly in the placebo arm.

Supportive evidence of efficacy: Real World Evidence Studies  
The  MAH  acknowledges  that  the  SOB  studies  as  designed  will  be  considered  the  primary  evidence 
characterizing  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  OCA  in  patients  with  PBC  but  has  provided  data  from  RWE 
sources as supplementary evidence. In their view, similar to other rare diseases, real-world observational 
studies using claims and registry data have utility as external controls (ECs) for clinical trials (US FDA 
2018, US FDA 2021c, ICMRA 2022).  
A total of three RWE studies evaluating analyses of hepatic clinical outcomes (i.e., time to death, liver 
transplant and hepatic decompensation) were conducted to provide supplementary evidence.  The MAH 
states that the eligibility criteria in these real-world studies reflect patients with compensated PBC with 
or without cirrhosis (hereafter referred to as the compensated population) indicated in the EU SmPC for 
Ocaliva.  
747-301/301 LTSE EC  
An EC analysis was conducted in patients on OCA in Study 747-301/301 LTSE compared to external-
weighted controls (Global PBC and United Kingdom [UK] PBC Registries) consisting of PBC patients who 
had failed UDCA but had not been prescribed Ocaliva (Murillo Perez 2022). Controls included patients 
who  met  Study  747-301  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  who  were  then  inverse  probability  of  treatment 
weighted (IPTW) to the OCA-treated arm in Study 747-301/301 LTSE based on key demographic, clinical, 
and  treatment  variables.  As  UK-PBC  only  analyzed  only  death  and  liver  transplant  (and  not  hepatic 
decompensation), the efficacy results in Section 2.2.3.1 are based on Global PBC only, which evaluated 
the primary composite endpoint of time to death, liver transplant or hepatic decompensation.  
Study 747-302 EC  
An  EC  analysis  was  conducted  in  patients  on  OCA  in  Study  747-302  compared  to  external-weighted 
controls  (Komodo  Health  US  Claims  database)  consisting  of  PBC  patients  who  had  failed  UDCA  or 
discontinued UDCA for 3 or more months but had not been prescribed Ocaliva. While this database is 
exclusively  from  US  claims,  the  association  between  OCA  treatment  and  outcomes  is  expected  to  be 
replicable despite differences in care patterns with the EU.  
Study 747-405  
This fully RWE study compares the incidence of hepatic clinical outcomes in patients with PBC initiating 
Ocaliva to a standardized mortality/morbidity ratio (SMR)-weighted control group of patients with PBC 
who would otherwise be eligible for, but who are not prescribed, Ocaliva. Administrative US claims data 
linked  (Komodo  Health  US  Claims  database)  to  additional  data  sources  were  used.  The  study  was 
designed to conform with the draft guidance “Real-World Data: Assessing Electronic Health Records and 
Medical Claims Data to Support Regulatory Decision Making for drug and Biological Products” (US FDA 
2021a).  
Recognizing  there  are  limited  guidelines  on  conduct  of  RWE  studies  to  support  regulatory  decision 
making,  the  Sponsor  has  extensive  documentation  regarding  data  sources,  data  storage  and 
management, and SOPs governing data analyses. These have been submitted to FDA per draft guidance 
(US FDA 2021b, US FDA 2021d) and can be provided to EMA upon request. 
Methods 
This summary of efficacy includes supplemental evidence sources for OCA-treated groups and non-OCA-
treated,  but  treatment  eligible,  comparator  groups  to  provide  a  comprehensive  evidence  package 
characterizing the efficacy and safety of OCA in patients with PBC.

Two studies provide supportive efficacy analyses from Study 747-301 and 747-302 using EC comparator 
arms. In addition, efficacy is supported by RWE Study 747-405, which compares the incidence of hepatic 
clinical  outcomes  in  patients  with  PBC  initiating  Ocaliva  to  a  standardized  morbidity  weighted  control 
group  of  patients  with  PBC  who  would otherwise  be  eligible  for,  but  who  are not prescribed,  Ocaliva. 
Importantly,  the  eligibility  criteria  in  these  studies  are  reflective  of  a  compensated  population  in 
alignment with the SmPC for Ocaliva.

747-301/301 LTSE EC - Study Population  
747-301/301 LTSE inclusion criteria were met by 1381 patients in the Global PBC registry, with 6702 
qualifying visits from which 1 index was randomly selected. Of the 6543 patients in the UK PBC registry, 
2135 patients met 747-301/301 LTSE inclusion criteria, with 8331 qualifying visits. The final sample for 
the  747-301/301  LTSE  arm  was  209  patients.  No  patients  in  Global  PBC  were  treated  with  OCA  or 
fibrates. In the UK PBC, 32 patients were treated with fibrates and 54 with OCA during follow up, <4% 
of  the  sample.  As  this  was  an  ITT  analysis,  these  patients  were  not  censored.  Standardized  variable 
differences  before  and  after  weighting  show  that  all  variables  were  within  the  pre-specified  ±0.25 
standardized mean difference (SMD) and the samples were comparable after weighting.

747-301/301 LTSE EC - Efficacy Summary 
Primary Analysis 
The  primary  outcome  was  time  to  first  occurrence  of  liver  transplant  or  death,  also  referred  to  as 
transplant-free  survival.  Over  the  6-year  follow-up  period,  there  were  5  (2.4%)  of  209  patients  with 
composite events (2 liver transplants and 3 deaths) in Study 747-301/301 LTSE (2.4%), 135 (10.0%) 
of 1381 patients with events (51 liver transplants and 84 deaths) in the Global PBC EC group, and 281 
events (119 liver transplants and 162 deaths) in 2135 patients in the UK PBC control group (13.2%). 
The pre-specified primary analysis using IPTW for the random index date yielded a HR of 0.29 (95% CI: 
0.10  to  0.83,  p=0.02)  for  Study  747-301/301  LTSE  vs  Global  PBC  and  0.30  (95%  CI:  0.12  to  0.75, 
p<0.01) for Study 747-301/301 LTSE vs UK PBC. 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 37/319 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Secondary Analysis  
The secondary outcome, time to first occurrence of liver transplant, death, or hepatic decompensation, 
was conducted only using the Global PBC EC, as hepatic decompensation was not systematically collected 
in the UK PBC registry.  
Over the 6-year follow-up period, there were 16 (7.7%) of 209 patients with composite events of death, 
liver transplant, or hepatic decompensation in the Study 747-301/301 LTSE and 212 (15.4%) of 1381 
patients with composite events patients in the Global PBC EC group. The IPTW HR was 0.42 (95% CI 
0.21, 0.85; p=0.02), indicating that patients treated with OCA in a trial setting had significantly greater 
event-free survival than patients in the Global PBC control group.  
Exploratory Analysis  
As  sensitivity  analyses  were  conducted  to  explore  potential  bias,  point  and  variance  estimates  were 
calculated  but  formal  statistical  testing  with  p-values  was  not  performed.  The  sensitivity  analyses 
assessed the effect of varying the index date for the control group (random index date [primary analysis], 
first qualifying visit date, and last qualifying visit date] on the HR estimates in the Global PBC database. 
The HRs were all ≤0.52, and overall, slightly higher for first qualifying visit and slightly lower for last 
qualifying visit. The 95% CIs all overlapped.  
Subgroup Analyses  
The Cox regression was run separately for patients with and without cirrhosis. Using the random index 
date,  the  HR  for  death  or  liver  transplant  among  patients  with  evidence  of  cirrhosis  for  OCA-treated 
patients in 747-301/301 LTSE versus Global PBC controls was HR=0.20 (95% CI 0.03, 1.22). For patients 
without cirrhosis, the HR=0.31 (95% CI 0.09, 1.04). Thus, while the effect size was somewhat larger in 
the  patients  with  evidence  of  cirrhosis,  the  CIs  were  widely  overlapping,  indicating  no  significant 
difference between patients with or without cirrhosis.  
747-301/301 LTSE EC - Safety Summary  
This study was not designed to assess safety, and there were no pre-specified safety analyses.  
747-301/301 LTSE EC - Overall Conclusions (as provided by the MAH) 
•  Patients  treated  with  OCA  in  the  trial  setting  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  and  clinically 
meaningful  greater  event  (liver  transplant  or  death)-free  survival  than  comparable  ECs  with  a 
relative risk reduction over a 6-year period of 70% for Global PBC and 71% for UK-PBC, respectively.  
•  Patients treated with OCA demonstrated a 58% relative risk reduction over a 6-year period for the 
composite  endpoint  of  hepatic  decompensation,  liver  transplant,  or  death  compared  to  non-OCA 
treated patients in the Global PBC registry.  
•  Reduction in risk was independent of presence or absence of cirrhosis.  
•  These results support the use of long-term OCA therapy to optimize prognosis of patients with PBC 
inadequately responding or intolerant to UDCA.

747-302 EC (Komodo) – Study Population  
A  total  of  334  patients  were  randomized  into  Study  747-302  of  whom  168  patients  were  in  the  OCA 
group. At the time of study termination, the study randomized less than 80% of planned enrollment.  
Overall, 162,587 patients in the Komodo Health claims database had at least 1 PBC claim between 01 
Jan 2014 and 31 Dec 2021, of whom 109,970 patients had 1 inpatient PBC claim and/or 2 outpatient 
PBC claims on different days. Of the 109,970 patients with 1 inpatient PBC claim and/or 2 outpatient 
PBC  claims  on  different  days,  laboratory  values  of  total  bilirubin,  ALP,  ALT,  AST,  and  platelets  were 
available  for  58,615  patients,  of  whom  19,944  had  evidence  of  at  least  1  total  bilirubin  and/or  ALP 
elevation ≤12 months before index or at the index. Of the 19,944 patients, 7693 patients had closed 
claims data available for at least 12 months before any total bilirubin or ALP elevation. In total, 5332 of 
the  7693  patients  used  UDCA  any  time  before  the  index,  of  whom  2325  met  the  definition  of  UDCA 
failure  (1021  patients  with  an  inadequate  UDCA  response,  1475  patients  discontinued  UDCA,  [171 
patients had both inadequate UDCA response and UDCA discontinuation indexes]). Of the 2325 patients 
with UDCA failure, 2307 were at least 18 years old at index.  
A total of 1233 patients met Study 747-302 eligibility criteria, of whom 944 had compensated disease 
at index.  
During  propensity  score  analyses,  182  of  1233  control  patients  were  removed  listwise  in  the  logistic 
regression if they were missing a predictor variable, e.g., if there was not a lab value proximal to the 
index leaving 1051 eligible control patients. Of the 1051 eligible EC group patients, 88.3% were female 
compared to 89.8% of the 168 eligible OCA-treated patients from Study 747-302. The mean age of the 
1051 eligible EC group patients from birth until index was 53.8 years (median 55; interquartile range 
[IQR] 46-63; range 18-87 years), versus 53.4 years for the eligible OCA-treated patients (median 53.5; 
IQR 46-60; range 29-75 years).  
The mean baseline total bilirubin and albumin levels for the EC group patients was similar to that of 747-
302 OCA-treated patients, and ALP, ALT, and AST levels were slightly lower for EC patients. Of the 1051 
eligible EC patients, 86.8% were taking UDCA at index, versus 87.5% of the OCA-treated subjects in 
747-302. Note that one non-OCA-treated patient was removed from the outcome analyses as the death 
date (set to the 1st of the month to maintain deidentification) occurred before the index date, leaving a 
total of 1232 non-OCA-treated patients.  
747-302 EC (Komodo) – Efficacy Summary  
The first endpoint (302 EC composite) in the 302 EC analysis excluded MELD score, as data were not 
available in Komodo for some of the individual biomarker components of the MELD score. The 302 EC 
expanded composite endpoint excluded MELD, CP-score, and bacterial empyema, as individual biomarker 
components of MELD and CP were not available in the Komodo database, and there is not an International 
Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 code for bacterial empyema. There was not additional confirmation 
of  hepatic  encephalopathy  with  West  Haven  scores;  ascites  with  diagnostic  paracentesis;  or  portal 
hypertension with transient elastography.  
The 302 EC SAP addendum specified: “Once data are unblinded and the event rate in the OCA-treated 
group of 747-302 is known, formal power analyses will be undertaken for each individual endpoint in 
each  cohort,  based  upon  an  effect  size  of  HR=0.60,  alpha=0.05,  and  with  known  numbers  of  OCA-
treated and control patients. Any endpoint analysis with either cohort that lacks sufficient power (less 
than 70%) will not be undertaken.”  
The power analyses showed that the only analysis that met pre-specified power requirements was the 
302  EC  expanded  composite  endpoint  for  the  overall  population  (1-β:  0.76).  Because  the  power  was 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 39/319 
 
  
 
 
close to the pre-specified threshold for the 302 EC composite endpoint, this analysis was undertaken as 
ad-hoc despite an understanding that it was under-powered (1-β: 0.65).  
302 EC Composite Endpoint  
The first endpoint was a composite event of the time to all cause death, liver transplant, uncontrolled 
ascites, or hospitalization for hepatic decompensation.  
OCA treatment was associated with a clinically meaningful 61% reduction in the relative risk (HR = 0.39: 
95%  CI:  0.22-0.69;  p=0.001)  for  death,  liver  transplant,  uncontrolled  ascites,  or  hosptialization  for 
hepatic  decompensation  among  747-302  OCA-treated  patients  (event  rate  =  17/168)  compared  to 
weighted non-OCA-treated patients in the EC group (event rate = 35.44/164.9). 
Among  the  weighted  OCA-treated  patient  indexes,  10.1%  had  an  event,  38.7%  discontinued  OCA-
treatment during the study period, 4.8% were censored for initiating commercial OCA, and 45.2% were 
censored at last contact. Among the weighted non-OCA-treated EC group patient indexes, 21.5% had 
an event, 14.8% were censored for initiating commercial OCA, 37.7% were censored for disenrollment, 
and 25.9% were censored for disenrollment/study end. Note that, unlike a clinical trial, the non-OCA-
treated EC group patients are not enrolled and then followed for a fixed period, thus only indexes in the 
first month could remain uncensored for the entire follow-up period.  
Similar results based on an ad hoc analysis were observed in the compensated subpopulation for the 
302 EC composite endpoint (see Section 3.3).  
302 EC Expanded Composite Endpoint  
The second endpoint was time to an expanded composite endpoint (see Table 4), footnote f for a detailed 
definition).  
OCA treatment was associated with a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 52% reduction in 
the relative risk for the expanded composite endpoint among 747-302 OCA-treated patients (event rate 
= 28/168) compared to weighted non-OCA-treated patients in the EC group (event rate = 45.52/164.9). 
For the pre-specified primary analysis in the SMR-weighted groups, the HR was 0.48 (95% CI: 0.30-
0.77; p=0.002). 
EMA/528620/2023

OCA-treated Patients in the Komodo Health Database  
Based on descriptive analysis, the event rates for the following groups using same censoring rules and 
as-treated approach for the primary EC analysis were assessed:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
747-302 OCA-treated group  
747-302 placebo group 
Komodo OCA-treated group 
Komodo non-OCA-treated EC  
For both 747-302 OCA-treated and Komodo OCA-treated patients, the event rates were similar for both 
OCA-treated  groups  for  the  302  EC  composite  endpoint  analyses  (9.3%  for  the  Komodo  OCA-treated 
and 10.1% for the 747-302 OCA-treated), and for the 302 EC expanded composite endpoint analyses 
(16.7%  for  both  OCA-treated  groups).  The  concordance  between  event  rates  between  the  study  and 
real-world data increases confidence in the reliability of these event rates. The event rates and survival 
curves for the 747-302 placebo group and Komodo non-OCA-treated EC differed significantly. The steady 
accumulation  of  events  in  the  Komodo  EC  group  is  more  consistent  with  the  natural  history  of  a 
population with advanced PBC disease failing first line therapy without second line treatment.

747-405 - Fully Real-World Evidence Study 
Study  747-405:  A  Study  to  Evaluate  the  Effectiveness  of  Obeticholic  Acid  on  Hepatic  Real-
World  Outcomes  in  Patients  with  Primary  Biliary  Cholangitis  (HEROES  PBC):  US  Komodo 
Health Claims Database  
This observational, retrospective cohort study employed a nested trial emulation design using Komodo 
Health claims data linked to laboratory, death, and transplant registry data to evaluate the effect of OCA 
treatment  on  time  to  occurrence  of  all-cause  death,  liver  transplant,  or  hospitalization  for  hepatic 
decompensation in PBC patients.  
747-405 - Study Population  
Patients  were  selected  to  represent  a  compensated  population  (with  or  without  cirrhosis)  in  order  to 
align with real-world practices. A total of 4,535 eligible patients contributed approximately 12,400 control 
indexes (mean 2.7; median 2; range 1 to 41) and 432 eligible patients contributed an OCA index (only 
one allowed; 218 patients also contributed at least 1 control index before initiating OCA). Note that 361 
control and 29 OCA-treated patients were missing variables temporal to index and were excluded list-
wise from the logistic regression, producing a final weighted sample of 403 OCA-treated and 4174 non-
OCA-treated controls for outcomes analysis. Person-time of follow-up was 498 patient-years for the OCA-
treated  group  and  17,167  patient-years  for  non-OCA-treated  controls.  After  SMR  weighting  and  the 
application of SMR weights, all SMRs for key demographic and baseline characteristics were below the 
pre-specified ±0.1 SMD threshold, indicating the samples were balanced and comparable.  
747-405 - Efficacy Summary  
Primary Analysis  
Before weighting, there were 8 composite events among the 432 OCA-treated patients (1.9%), and 260 
composite events among the 4,535 non-OCA-treated control patients (5.7%). There were 741 events 
among the 12,399 control indexes (6.0%). After SMR weighting, there were 8 composite events among 
the  403  OCA-treated  patients  (2.0%),  and  31.8  events  among  the  405.4  weighted  control  indexes 
(7.9%).  
The unweighted HR for the composite outcome of death, liver transplant or hospitalization for hepatic 
decompensations for OCA-treated versus non-OCA-treated patients was 0.41 (95% CI: 0.15-0.74; p-
value <0.001). The SMR-adjusted HR was 0.37 (95% CI: 0.14-0.75; p-value <0.001). 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 42/319 
 
  
 
 
OCA treatment was associated with a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 63% reduction in 
the relative risk for death, liver transplant, and hospitalization for hepatic decompensation compared to 
OCA-eligible but non-OCA-treated controls. These results closely mirror the previously reported HR of 
0.42 (58% reduction observed) in the Study 747-301/301 LTSE study (Murillo Perez 2022) with ECs, 
which  utilized  similar  eligibility  criteria  and  endpoints,  as  well  as  similar  to  the  747-302  EC  analyses 
despite 747-302 representing a more advanced population with PBC.  
Exploratory Analyses  
The  exploratory  analyses  evaluated  the  effect  of  OCA  on  each  of  the  components  of  the  composite 
endpoints  in  the  SMR-weighted  cohorts:  death,  liver  transplant,  and  hospitalization  for  hepatic 
decompensation using competing risk models. The results for death (HR=0.38; 95% CI: 0.00-1.26; p-
value=0.118)  and  for  hepatic  decompensation  (HR=0.37;  95%  CI:  0.09-0.85;  p-value=0.012)  were 
similar in effect size to the composite endpoint. The HR for liver transplant could not be estimated as no 
liver transplants occurred in the OCA-treated group. 
Subgroup Analyses  
Apart  from  male  gender,  all  subgroup  analyses  results  were  directionally  the  same.  The  subgroup 
analyses showed a largely consistent benefit of OCA treatment on the risk of the composite endpoint. 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 43/319 
 
  
 
 
 
 
The quantitative bias assessment demonstrated that the observed OCA treatment benefit would continue 
to be observed even in the presence of significant confounding, i.e., a confounder present in 50% of the 
population and highly associated with both probability of treatment and occurrence of outcomes. This 
was also true if the HR was at the upper end of the 95% CI (HR=0.752) and the confounder was prevalent 
in 5% of the population. Even when a hypothetical confounder is prevalent in 50% of the population with 
a  HR=0.752,  only  when  its  association  with  the  outcome  is  very  strong  (HR<0.50)  does the  HR  stop 
reflecting  treatment  benefit.  Thus,  the  observed  benefit  is  highly  robust  in  the  face  of  unmeasured 
confounding.  
747-405 - Safety Summary  
This study was not designed to assess safety, and there were no pre-specified safety analyses.  
747-405 - Overall Conclusions (as provided by the MAH) 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The results of this study demonstrate that OCA treatment is associated with a statistically significant 
and  clinically  meaningful  benefit,  a  HR  of  0.37  equivalent  to  a  63%  reduction  in  relative  risk  for 
hospitalization for hepatic decompensation, liver transplant or death compared to OCA-eligible but 
non-OCA-treated controls.  
The  exploratory  efficacy  endpoint  analyses  showed  similar  reductions  separately  for  death  (62%) 
and for hepatic decompensation (63%). As no liver transplants occurred in the OCA-treated group, 
a HR could not be calculated.  
The effect of OCA treatment on the risk of the composite endpoint was directionally consistent across 
subgroups, and largely consistent in terms of effect size, with the exception of male gender where 
HR=1.0 (limited by small sample size n=34).  
The  quantitative  bias  assessment  demonstrated  that  the  observed  OCA  treatment  benefit  would 
continue to be observed even in the presence of significant confounding.  
Discussion 
OCA was granted CMA in the EU in December 2016, for its administration in combination with UDCA for 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 44/319 
 
  
 
 
 
the treatment of adult patients with PBC who have an inadequate response to UDCA or as monotherapy 
in  adults  unable  to  tolerate  UDCA.  This  initial  approval  was  based  on  results  from  the  phase  3, 
randomized,  double  blind,  placebo-controlled  Study  747-301,  which  demonstrated  a  clinically  and 
statistically significant, sustained reduction in ALP. 
At the time of the CMA granted for Ocaliva, benefit had only been shown in terms of ALP reductions, 
with rare cases of normalization. Thus, the main efficacy uncertainty was to what extent those changes 
in laboratory parameters correlate with a risk reduction in relevant clinical liver outcomes in PBC patients, 
and thus, on the actual clinical benefit of OCA treatment. Other important uncertainties were the lack of 
efficacy/safety data in patients with a more advanced stage of the disease, and concerns on long-term 
(liver and CV) safety data. Given the lack of treatment options in patients unresponsive or unable to 
tolerate UDCA and the debilitating nature of PBC, a CMA was granted based on incomplete data with the 
condition to address these limitations, and provide comprehensive data, within two PAES requested as 
specific  obligations  (SOBs).  Full  approval  of  OCA  was  contingent  on  a  post-approval  requirement  to 
confirm benefit by assessing the effect of OCA on clinical outcomes such as hepatic decompensation, 
liver transplant, and death and across the spectrum of liver disease severity. 
The MAH has now submitted results of these two SOBs, which are the primary evidence of efficacy and 
safety,  aimed  to  confirm  the  benefits  and  risks  of  Ocaliva  across  the  spectrum  of  PBC  patients  after 
failure or intolerance to UDCA. Unfortunately, none of these two studies have been completed given that 
both were prematurely terminated.  
Study 747-401 was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study evaluating the PK and safety 
of  OCA  in  patients  with  PBC  and  moderate  to  severe  hepatic  impairment  followed  for  48  weeks.  The 
Sponsor terminated prematurely this study given that the whole study population (n=22, 10 in OCA and 
12 in placebo) had decompensated liver disease, in whom a contraindication was included in the SmPC 
while  the  study  was  ongoing  (variation  submitted  Jul  2021-EC  decision  June  2022).  The  majority  of 
patients had CP Class B (100.0% [OCA] and 91.7% [placebo]) whereas 0.0% (OCA) and 8.3% (placebo) 
patients had CP Class C. 
Study  747-302  was  a  double-blind,  randomized,  placebo-controlled,  multicenter  study  designed  to 
prospectively obtain evidence to confirm the clinical benefit in terms of liver clinical outcomes and to 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 45/319 
 
  
 
 
 
further evaluate the benefit-risk profile of OCA treatment in patients with PBC. The primary analysis was 
a  log  rank  test  comparing  the  OCA-treated  arm  to  the  placebo  arm  on time  to  first  occurrence  of  an 
adjudicated  event  in  the  composite  endpoint  (all  cause  death,  liver  transplant,  MELD  score  ≥15, 
hospitalization for new onset or recurrence of: variceal bleed, hepatic encephalopathy (as defined by a 
West  Haven  score  of  ≥2,  confirmed  spontaneous  bacterial  peritonitis,  uncontrolled  ascites  requiring 
paracentesis at least twice in a month). The study was event driven and total duration was determined 
on the time required to accrue approximately 127 adjudicated primary endpoint events (based on the 
assumed HR of 0.6 and to provide 80% power), estimated to be approximately 10 years. Patients were 
expected to have a minimum follow-up time of approximately 6 years. 
As supplementary information, the following data are provided:  
- results of the long-term safety extension (LTSE) of Study 747-301, initially submitted as pivotal Phase 
3 trial, plus  
-  results  of  3  RWE  studies  (2  were  indeed  external  controlled  analyses  of  OCA-treated  patients  from 
Studies 747-301 and 747-302).  
Based on this evidence, the MAH is seeking to revert the CMA to a regular MA for Ocaliva.  
Results 
- Study 747-401 (top line PK and safety data)  
At the time of granting of the CMA for Ocaliva, the CHMP imposed the MAH (SOB) to submit the results 
of Study 747-401, aimed to assess the PK and safety profile of OCA in patients with more advanced liver 
disease.  The  study  was  prematurely  terminated  upon  the  EU  SmPC  update  in  2021,  following  a 
contraindication for the use of OCA in patients with advanced liver disease.  
PK data were only available for 6 patients with moderate hepatic impairment; according to the MAH 5 
mg  once  weekly  OCA  achieved  OCA  exposure  like  the  general  PBC  population  without  hepatic 
impairment.  No  clinically  meaningful  differences  were  noted  between  OCA  and  placebo  for  efficacy 
endpoints,  though  the  number  of  patients  was  small,  and  the  study  was  not  designed  to  detect 
differences between treatment groups.  
Of note, safety data of this study, not unexpectedly, are concerning. The study only included 22 out of 
the planned 50 subjects. Results of this study show a significant toxicity and the possible contribution of 
OCA treatment cannot be ruled out. Despite testing a reduced dose of OCA (5mg once a week, titrated 
to 5mg twice a week), treatment was poorly tolerated in both treatment arms. All 22 (100.0%) subjects 
reported at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE). The most common TEAEs were ascites, 
oesophageal varices haemorrhage, pneumonia, all of them reported most frequently in OCA treated arm. 
Treatment-related TEAEs occurred in 4 (40.0%) subjects in the OCA group and 6 (50.0%) subjects in 
the placebo group. Nine (90.0%) subjects in the OCA group and 9 (75.0%) subjects in the placebo group 
experienced TEAEs of special interest. Six (60.0%) subjects in the OCA group and 7 (58.3%) subjects 
in  the  placebo  group  experienced  severe  (Grade  3)  TEAEs.  Related  Grade  3  TEAEs  included  upper 
gastrointestinal haemorrhage, hepatic failure, pyrexia, and hepatic function abnormal. Of the Grade 3 
TEAEs,  4  subjects  experienced  a  TEAE  (multiple  organ  dysfunction  syndrome,  cardiac  arrest,  hepatic 
encephalopathy, and aortic aneurysm rupture, respectively) that resulted in a fatal outcome, which were 
all  not  related  or  unlikely  related  to  the  study  treatment.  Overall,  study  treatment  discontinuations 
occurred in 5 (50.0%) subjects in the OCA and 5 (41.7%) in the placebo groups and study treatment 
interruptions occurred in 5 (50.0%) subjects in the OCA and 4 (33.3%) subjects in the placebo groups. 
Four  subjects  (3  OCA-treated  and  1  placebo-treated)  experienced  a  TEAE  of  upper  gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage,  cardiac  arrest  secondary  to  bleeding  from  oesophageal  varices,  hepatobiliary  disorder, 
and ascites, respectively) that led to both study drug interruption and study discontinuation. A total of 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 46/319 
 
  
 
 
7  (70.0%)  subjects  in  the  OCA  and  9  (75.0%)  subjects  in  the  placebo  groups  experienced  serious 
adverse  events  (SAEs).  Six  out  of  the  7  subjects  in  OCA  reported  SAEs  of  bleeding  of  oesophageal 
varices/upper GI haemorrhage (4 cases) or cardiac arrest/MI (2) vs no subjects in placebo. Five subjects 
died during the study (3 in placebo-treated subjects: hepatic encephalopathy, aortic aneurysm rupture, 
and clear cell renal cell carcinoma; and 2 in OCA-treated subjects: multiple organ dysfunction syndrome 
and cardiac arrest).  
Overall, no relevant differences were observed between treatment arms in the incidences of TEAEs, G3 
TEAEs, SAEs TEAEs, and those noted can be explained by the low number of subjects in each treatment 
arm.  Indeed,  the  low  number  of  subjects  included  and  premature  study  interruption,  do  not  allow 
reaching sound conclusions on the actual safety profile of OCA in PBC with an advanced liver disease. 
Nevertheless,  a  numerical  difference  between  treatment  arms,  disfavouring  OCA  treatment,  is 
systematically observed for hepatic AESI (9 patients (14 events) OCA vs 8 patients (11 events) placebo), 
cardiac AESIs (3 patients 5 events in OCA vs 1 subject/event placebo), pruritus (3 OCA vs 1placebo), 
and  bleeding  GI  events  (both  G3  and  SAEs  were  reported  in  OCA  patients  while  no  such  cases  were 
reported in placebo (4 in OCA: 3 events of bleeding of oesophageal varices +1 upper GI haemorrhage 
OCA treated groups), which should be noted and support the current contraindication in the SmPC.   
Cumulative  post-marketing  evidence  has  led  to  contraindicate  the  use  of  OCA  in  patients  with 
decompensated  cirrhosis  (e.g.,  Child-Pugh  Class  B  or  C)  or  a  prior  decompensation  event  due  to 
increased reporting of hepatic failure events, sometimes fatal or resulting in liver transplant. Further, 
precautionary  wording  has  been  included  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  and  section  4.8  (‘Undesirable 
effects’) was also updated to include hepatobiliary disorders in the tabulated list of adverse reactions. It 
is agreed with the MAH that the data from this study 401 are of limited value to prescribers for Ocaliva 
in PBC, the use of OCA is contraindicated in this subset of the PBC population. However, the increased 
incidence of liver events and AESI seen in patients with a more advanced liver disease treated with OCA 
raises important questions on whether the problem is truly restricted to this subset of patients, or by 
contrary,  if  similar  findings  can  be  expected  in  the  general  population  with  PBC.  The  results  of  the 
following study may add some clarity in this regard.  
The above said, the SOB is considered fulfilled given that the main uncertainty driving the requirement, 
i.e. lack of evidence in patients with more advanced liver disease to establish B/R, is now adequately 
addressed. 
Study 747-302 
This  SOB  was  imposed  at  the  time  of  approval  to  confirm  the  clinical  benefit,  in  clinical  relevant 
outcomes/endpoints, associated with OCA treatment in patients with PBC who are either unresponsive 
or intolerant to UDCA treatment. 
A  total  of  334  patients  were  randomized  in  the  study  and  were  included  in  the  ITT  Population:  168 
patients in the OCA and 166 patients in the placebo groups. 
Although the protocol did originally plan for 2 interim analyses, one at ~50% (64 events) and the other 
at ~75% (96 events) information fraction, the first interim analysis was postponed to after regulatory 
authority review of the interim SAP. As a result, the first interim analysis occurred after the accrual of 
approximately  65%  (83  events)  of  the  required  total  clinical  outcome  events.  It  was  agreed  that  the 
second interim analysis would be omitted. O’Brien-Fleming Boundaries were used for superiority in the 
interim analysis. 
According to the MAH the study has faced enrolment and retention difficulties and a transition to an open 
label design versus historic control was proposed. This plan was discussed several times with the CHMP 
and deemed not acceptable. The MAH also proposed a revision of the composite primary endpoint, to 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 47/319 
 
  
 
 
extend the list of components adding some less robust components to increase the power of the study, 
which was not agreed by the CHMP either.  The study was prematurely terminated by the Sponsor, at 
the time when the study had randomized nearly 80% of planned enrolment (i.e., 334 of the targeted 
428  patients)  and  approximately  67%  of  the  protocol-specified  number  of  clinical  events  had  been 
observed  (last  patient  last  visit  Dec  2021),  based  on  the  recommendations  of  the  data  monitoring 
committee  due  to  “feasibility  challenges”.  However,  it  is  noted  that  with  67% of  the  planned  events, 
which is not a negligible portion, the study failed to show any differences between treatments for the 
primary composite endpoint of death, liver transplant, or hepatic decompensation for the ITT population: 
HR 1.01 (95%CI 0.68, 1.51), p value 0.954.  
Notably,  the  results  for  the  primary  endpoint  according  to  the  liver  disease  status  compensated  vs 
decompensated show a numerical increment in the risk of event outcomes in decompensated patients 
treated  with  OCA  (59.4%  OCA  vs  54.1%  in  placebo,  HR  1.22  (0.65,  2.28)),  though  not  statistically 
significant.  By  contrary,  results  were  nearly  identical  in  both  treatment  arms  in  the  subgroup  of 
compensated  PBC  patients  (21.3%  vs  21.7%  OCA  and  placebo,  respectively,  HR  0.98  (0.58,  1.64)). 
Thus,  the  study  has  failed  to  demonstrate  any  clinical  benefit  of  OCA  treatment  in  relevant  clinical 
outcomes and across the spectrum of PBC patients.  
Secondary endpoint analyses show that only a total of 21 (6.3%) patients enrolled in Study 747-302 
met the primary endpoint as defined in the initial pivotal phase 3 Study 747-301 of an ALP <1.67x ULN 
and total bilirubin ≤ULN and ALP decrease from baseline of ≥15%. Indeed, the rate of responders was 
substantially lower compared to that previously reported and this was the case in both treatment arms, 
but rather noticeable in the OCA treated group (OCA 10.1% vs 2.4% placebo in Study 747-302 vs OCA 
34.0% vs 7% placebo in Study 747-301). No statistically significant differences were reported, adding 
even further uncertainties to the actual efficacy of OCA in the treatment of PBC. The MAH was requested 
to explain the observed differences, considering that Study 302 included a more advanced liver disease 
population likely representative of the actual target population in clinical practice. The MAH argues that 
the actual target population in clinical practice is more like that included in Study 747-301, based on 
comparison of baseline disease characteristics of European registries, and much less severe than that 
included in Study 747-302. It is also argued that subjects with higher values at baseline might unlikely 
reach  normal  (or  near  normal)  biochemical  ALP/BR  values,  and  that  similar  absolute  changes  in  ALP 
values  are  expected  (and  thus  similar  benefits  from  treatment).  However,  the  actual  meaning  of  the 
observed quantitative reductions of ALP/BR values, in the absence of concurrent changes in histological 
progression, is highly uncertain and of doubtful clinical relevance. Indeed, the predictive value of the 
changes  in  biochemical  parameters  with  respect  to  relevant  clinical  outcomes  in  PBC  has  not  been 
established yet. In fact, it is argued by the expert’s community that isolated changes in ALP/BR, without 
changes in histological progression, are of doubtful relevance to patients.  
In line with previous minor changes in relevant biochemical parameters, changes in prognostic endpoints 
(MELD score, MELD-Na score, CP score, and Mayo Risk Score) that are predictive of clinical outcomes 
for chronic liver disease did not show significant differences between groups in a consistent way. Indeed, 
isolated statistically significant differences at some time points and limited to MELD and MELD-Na scores, 
accounting mostly for biochemical changes and of doubtful clinical relevance, were noted. CP score and 
MRS remained stable over time.  
In conclusion, the two PAES required as SOBs of the OCA CMA have been prematurely terminated one 
due to the negative safety profile of OCA in PBC patients with moderate to severe liver impairment or 
decompensation, that led to a treatment contraindication in this subset of patients, and the other due 
“recruitment  challenges”,  but  indeed  showing  treatment  futility  regardless  of  the  severity  of  liver 
impairment. Thus, the confirmatory study 302 has failed to demonstrate the efficacy of OCA in reducing 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 48/319 
 
  
 
 
the  risk  of  relevant  clinical  outcomes  in  patients  with  PBC,  regardless  of  the  liver  disease  severity. 
Consequently, the benefit of OCA in the treatment of PBC is not demonstrated.  
The MAH argues that results of the confirmatory Study 302 cannot be interpreted due to lack of power 
and to the risk of bias, and this justifies the need for “supportive” external controls. Surprisingly, the HR 
does  not  even  show  a  trend  for  a  favourable  effect  in  the  primary  composite  endpoint  (despite  the 
significant  portion  of  events)  or  in  any  of  the  individual  or  composite  event  outcomes  analysed  as 
secondary endpoints. The plan to conduct a post-hoc external control analyses using RWE to overcome 
the “risk of bias” of a well-designed randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, even recognising 
challenges in the study conduct, does not seem a convincing approach bearing in mind the inherent bias 
of  this  type  of  comparisons  and  the  huge  difficulties  to  adequately  control  them.  Several  relevant 
problems are identified, which preclude relying on these analyses to reach any conclusions on the efficacy 
of OCA in preventing relevant liver outcomes and, definitively, to use these results to counterbalance or 
even overcome failed results of a RCT. Further discussion in this regard is included below.  
The  MAH  justifies  the  need  for  the  EC  group  by  stating  that  the  validity  of  ITT  analyses  depends  on 
successfully balancing randomisation and maintaining treatment and placebo allocation throughout the 
trial.  Additional  arguments  are  based  on  the  claim  that  the  reported  results  in  Study  747-302  were 
underpowered and potentially biased for a list of reasons discussed below.  
Firstly, according to the MAH, an unblinded analysis, with a weighting procedure to balance the groups 
on the post-hoc observed between-group differences, would be better than a fully blinded randomisation 
procedure. Notably, this would guarantee asymptotically similarity only on the observed variables and, 
from  a  regulatory  perspective  a  weighting  (or  even  a  matching)  procedure  will  never  be  considered 
better or even equivalent to randomisation. 
Secondly,  while  it  is  agreed  that  the  availability  of  commercial  OCA  might  be  considered  as  an 
intercurrent event that might potentially interfere the results of the trial, the sensitivity analyses provided 
by the MAH on the trial results do not support their hypothesis. Sensitivity analyses on the per protocol 
(PP)  population  and  several  data  exclusion  analyses  on  the  ITT  population  (after  90  days  of 
investigational  product  discontinuation,  after  commercial  Ocaliva  initiation,  commercial  availability  of 
Ocaliva per subject’s country and other intercurrent events) were consistent with the results observed 
in the ITT population. 
Thirdly,  the  MAH  states  that  differential  discontinuation  of  the  study  drug  was  observed,  resulting  in 
lower  exposure  in  the  placebo  group,  and  this  was  considered  by  the  MAH  to  be  a  source  of  bias. 
However, time on-treatment should not be a major  issue to gather the endpoints if patient follow-up 
after  discontinuation  is  ensured,  and  the  potential  effect  of  the  concomitant  Ocaliva  off-study  was 
addressed in the sensitivity analyses discussed above with no change in the interpretation of the trial 
results. 
Fourthly, while it is agreed that the fact that the trial was stopped prematurely theoretically reduced the 
chances of a positive outcome, post-hoc power is meaningless once the trial is finished. In fact, the post-
hoc power was calculated on the assumption that the size of the treatment effect was true, which is not 
clear at all according to the primary trial results. In any case, it could ultimately be a problem of lack of 
sample size, but never a problem of bias. 
Overall, the observed differences in the estimation of the treatment effect for the primary endpoint using 
the primary randomisation and the IPCW, demonstrate the high risk of bias associated to the reported 
analyses based on the weighting procedure, as compared to the results of Study 747-302. All results 
based on the EC are considered to have the same problem of bias. Furthermore, in addition to all the 
issues discussed above, the analyses resulting from the comparisons with EC should be understood in 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 49/319 
 
  
 
 
the  context  of  a  pivotal  trial  in  which  the  primary  analysis  failed,  leaving  no  alpha  for  confirmatory 
testing. As a result, any further analyses should be considered exploratory only. 
8.  Clinical Safety aspects 
Methods – analysis of data submitted 
The safety summary presented as part of the Clinical Overview focuses only on the results from the 
following:  
• 
• 
PMR Study 747-302 in patients with PBC using the Safety population, which comprised of 334 
patients (265 patients with compensated liver disease (with or without cirrhosis) at baseline, which 
is the indicated population per SmPC), and in the subset of compensated liver disease. 
Post-marketing experience in over 28000 cumulative estimated patient-years defined as all 
patients who received at least 1 dose of investigational product through the data cut off of 26 May 
2022 
Safety data from Study 747-301 LTSE and Study 747-401 have been briefly summarized in the previous 
Section.  
Results 
Patients exposure 
The clinical safety information is based on approximately 4518 patients who received at least one dose 
of OCA in clinical trials sponsored by Intercept and Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Co., Ltd. (Intercept’s 
former  development  partner  in  China,  Korea,  and  Japan).  Estimated  cumulative  patient  exposure  in 
Intercept- and Sumitomo-sponsored clinical trials since the beginning of the OCA development program 
is summarized in Table 12.  
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 50/319 
 
  
 
 
OCA Exposure in Post-marketing Requirement Study 747-302  
Duration of investigational product exposure 334 patients in enrolled in Study 747-302 is presented in 
Figure 7 and Table 13. The mean durations of exposure for the OCA and placebo groups were 876 days 
and  745  days,  respectively.  The  OCA  group  had  more  patients  than  the  placebo  group  who  received 
investigational product >721 days (91 patients in the OCA group and 71 patients in the placebo group).  
Patients with compensated disease (with or without cirrhosis), which is the indicated population per the 
EU SmPC, received investigational product for a longer duration than patients with more advanced stage 
PBC  (i.e.,  decompensated).  The  mean  durations  of  exposure  for  patients  with  compensated  disease 
were: 951 days for the OCA group and 814 days for the placebo group. The mean durations of exposure 
for patients with decompensated disease were: 561 days for the OCA group and 505 days for the placebo 
group.

Cumulative and Interval Patient Exposure from Post-marketing Experience  
As of 26 May 2022, the estimated cumulative patient exposure from marketing experience is more than 
28000 patient-years. Estimates of post-marketing exposure are based on sales distribution data that are 
provided by the Sponsor’s commercial organization (Table 14). The data reflect sales of the Sponsor’s 
products  and  contain  information  on  the  number  of  units  shipped  each  month.  Each  unit  (bottle)  of 
Ocaliva contains 30 tablets and is assumed to be prescribed at 1 tablet per day. Sales distribution data 
are converted into an estimate of exposure in patient-years by total units*30 days per unit/365.25 days 
per  year.  Where  product  volume  sales  information  is  not  yet  available,  post-marketing  exposure  is 
estimated by prorating the trailing 3-month mean exposure.  
It  should  be  noted  that  the  use  of  sales  data  for  patient  exposure  calculations  overestimate  or 
underestimate exposure depending on the accumulation of stock in the distribution channels, and the 
reduced dosing schedule in patients with hepatic impairment and for the management of tolerability.

OCA Exposure in Long-Term Safety Extension Study 747-301  
A total of 193 patients received at least 1 dose of OCA during the LTSE (Table 15). The median number 
of days on OCA was 1944.0 days (5.3 years) from initiation of OCA regardless of initiation in the double-
blind or LTSE phase. The median weighted average daily OCA dose was 8.3 mg. Forty-two (of the 193 
patients (22%) received OCA >10 mg daily at some point during the study. 
Baseline Characteristics Study 302 (vs Study 301) 
The  demographic  characteristics  of  the  patients  with  compensated  liver  disease  (with  or  without 
cirrhosis) at baseline in Study 747-302, which is the indicated population in the EU SmPC, and in Study 
EMA/528620/2023

747-301 were representative of that expected in clinical practice (Table 16). Patients were predominantly 
women presenting with PBC after the age of 50 years.  
Overall, patients in Study 747-302 reflected an advanced disease population compared to previous PBC 
studies (i.e., 747-301): 69 (21%) patients had decompensated disease at baseline and are considered 
contraindicated per the CCDS and SmPC revision that occurred while the study was ongoing (32 patients 
in the OCA group and 37 patients in the placebo group). Patients with compensated disease in Study 
747-302 were predominantly women presenting with PBC after the age of 50 years, had higher baseline 
ALP,  total  bilirubin,  Model  for  End-Stage  Liver  Disease  (MELD),  and  Rotterdam  criteria  compared  to 
patients in Study 747-301 (Table 17).

Safety Results  
Study 747-302 
The Safety population included 334 subjects with PBC, who received at least 1 dose of investigational 
product  (166  subjects  received  placebo  and  168  subjects  received  OCA).  Separate  safety  results  are 
presented  for  the  subset  of  265  patients  with  compensated  liver  disease  (with  or  without  cirrhosis) 
included in Study 747-302, 129 patients in placebo and 136 patients treated with OCA.

Adverse events 
For the Safety population, higher rates of events were reported for OCA compared to placebo, including 
any TEAE (96.4% OCA vs 95.2% placebo), any TEAE leading to discontinuation (36.9% OCA vs 27.1% 
placebo), any TEAE leading to study discontinuation (17.3% Oca vs 11.4%placebo), treatment related 
TEAE (79.2% OCA vs 66.9% placebo), treatment related TEAE leading to discontinuation (20.8% OCA 
vs 12.7% placebo), treatment-emergent SAE (31.5% OCA vs 31.9% placebo), Severe TEAE (51.2% OCA 
vs 39.2% placebo),  and TEAEs leading to death (3.0% OCA vs 1.2% placebo), which is very concerning. 
Overall,  162  (96.4%)  subjects  in  the  OCA  group  had  a  total  of  2349  TEAEs  and  158  (95.2%)  in  the 
placebo  group  had  a  total  of  1815  TEAEs.  Consistent  with  earlier  studies,  pruritus  was  the  most 
frequently reported treatment-related TEAE and the most common TEAE leading to discontinuation of 
investigational product.  
Overall,  162  (96.4%)  subjects  in  the  OCA  group  had  a  total  of  2349  TEAEs  and  158  (95.2%)  in  the 
placebo group had a total of 1815 TEAEs.

In  the  compensated  group,  the  incidence  of  patients  who  reported  a  treatment-emergent  adverse 
event (TEAE) was similar across treatment groups: 95.6% patients in the OCA group and 94.6% in the 
placebo group. The majority of TEAEs were mild and moderate in severity. The incidence of severe TEAEs 
was  higher  in  the  OCA  group  (47.1%)  than  the  placebo  group  (36.4%),  which  was  driven  by  the 
occurrence  of  severe  pruritus.  Treatment-related  TEAEs  were  reported  by  78.7%  patients  in  the  OCA 
group and 62.0% patients in the placebo group. The incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of 
investigational  product  was  higher  in  the  OCA  group  (33.1%)  than  the  placebo  group  (27.9%). 
Consistent with earlier studies, pruritus was the most frequently reported treatment related TEAE and 
the most common TEAE leading to discontinuation of investigational product. In the compensated group, 
the incidence of TEAEs leading to death was similar across treatment groups (2 patients each in the OCA 
and  placebo  group).  All  TEAEs  leading  to  death  were  assessed  by  the  Investigator  as  not  related  or 
unlikely related to investigational product.  
The incidence of SAEs in the compensated group was numerically lower in OCA-treated patients (24.3%) 
than the placebo group (31.0%).  
In the overall Safety population (both patients with compensated and decompensated disease) in Study 
747-302, the safety profile was similar to that in the compensated group. The most frequently reported 
TEAE was pruritus, which had a higher incidence in the OCA group (78.6%) than in the placebo group 
(51.2%). In addition to pruritus, other TEAEs in ≥10% of OCA-treated subjects and were reported more 
frequently in the OCA group compared with placebo included peripheral edema (18.5% in the OCA group 
and  10.8%  in  the  placebo  group);  abdominal  pain  which  includes  the  following  preferred  terms: 
Abdominal Pain Upper PT (14.9% in the OCA group and 7.2% in the placebo group), Abdominal Pain PT 
(12.5% in the OCA group and 10.8% in the placebo group) and Abdominal Pain Lower PT (4.8% in the 
OCA group and 1.2% in the placebo group); nausea (14.9% in the OCA group and 12.7% in the placebo 
group); headache (13.7% in the OCA group and 12.7% in the placebo group); constipation (11.3% in 
the OCA group and 6.0% in the placebo group); and nasopharyngitis (10.7% in the OCA group and 8.4% 
in the placebo group). (Table 18).

A  total  of  133  (79.2%)  subjects  in  the  OCA  group  and  111  (66.9%)  subjects  in  the  placebo  group 
experienced at least 1 TEAE assessed by the Investigator as related to investigational product (OCA or 
placebo) (Table 58). The most frequently reported treatment-related TEAE was pruritus (70.2% in the 
OCA group and 43.4% in the placebo group). Other more frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs 
(≥5% in OCA-treated subjects) were nausea (6.5% in the OCA group and 4.8% in the placebo group) 
and blood bilirubin increased (7.7 % in the OCA group and 9.6% in the placebo group).

A total of 86 (51.2%) subjects in the OCA group and 65 (39.2%) subjects in the placebo group had at 
least 1 severe TEAE (Table 59). The difference in incidence of severe TEAEs across treatment groups 
was  driven  by  the  occurrence  of  severe  pruritus  (30.4%  in  the  OCA  group  and  9.0%  in  the  placebo 
group). With the exception of pruritus and esophageal varices hemorrhage, severe TEAEs by PT occurred 
in less than 2% subjects.

Adverse Events of Special Interest 
TEAEs that were prespecified as adverse events of special interest (AESIs) in Study 747-302 included 
Cardiovascular, Cholecystitis/cholelithiasis, Dyslipidemia, Hepatic, Pruritis, and Renal TEAEs. 
The  majority  of  treatment-emergent  AESIs  were  mild  or  moderate,  with  a  similar  incidence  across 
treatment  groups.  Severe  treatment  emergent  AESIs  were  more  common  in  the  OCA  group  (38.7%) 
than the placebo group (22.9%).  
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 61/319 
 
  
 
 
 
In the compensated group, the incidence of treatment emergent AESIs was 88.2 in the OCA group and 
79.8% in placebo (Table 19). Similarly, a higher incidence of cardiovascular AEs, pruritus and renal AEs 
were reported in this subgroup of patients. The higher incidences of CVs and renal AESIs is concerning.  
Table  19:  Treatment-Emergent  Adverse  Events  of  Special  Interest  in  Patients  with 
Compensated Disease in Study 747-302 (Safety Population) 
Pruritus 
Pruritus was identified as an adverse drug reaction (ADR) in the labeling of Ocaliva for PBC and was 
removed as an important identified risk (as it is considered well characterized in the product labels, 
there are no outstanding pharmacovigilance activities, and the measures to avoid the risk are 
adequately described in the product information) in EU RMP V.1.3, approved on 11 June 2021. The 
exact pathogenesis of the pruritic effect of OCA is unknown, although it is currently hypothesized to be 
associated with an on-target FXR effect.  
In Study 747-302, mild to moderate pruritus was the most commonly reported TEAE. In patients with 
compensated  disease,  80.1%  patients  in  the  OCA  group  and  51.9%  patients  in  the  placebo  group 
reported pruritus. Of these, eye pruritus and pruritus allergic occurred only in the OCA group in 1.5% 
patients. The majority of TEAEs reported in patients with compensated disease was pruritus: 79.4% in 
the  OCA  group  and  51.2%  in  the  placebo  group.  The  incidence  of  pruritus  SAEs  was  low  in  the 
compensated group: 2 patients in the OCA group and none in the placebo group. The majority of pruritus 
events,  regardless  of  severity,  were  experienced  within  the  first  few  months  of  treatment.  In  the 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 62/319 
 
  
 
 
 
 
compensated group, pruritus events led to permanent discontinuation of the investigational product in 
12.5% patients in the OCA group and 1.6% in the placebo group.  
Among those  patients experiencing  any  pruritus,  most  were  able  to  continue treatment  with  OCA.  Of 
those  patients  able  to  tolerate  pruritus  and  remain  on  investigational  product,  the  majority 
(approximately 70%) had used some form of management strategy for their pruritus, with treatment 
interruption  appearing  to  be  the  most  effective  approach.  Management  and  dosage  adjustment  for 
intolerable pruritus are addressed in the SmPC. 
Cardiovascular adverse events 
In the overall safety population, 16 (9.5%) subjects in the OCA and 7 (4.2%) subjects in the placebo 
groups  reported  a  cardiovascular  treatment-emergent  AESI  (Table  67).  The  following  cardiovascular 
treatment-emergent AESIs were reported in 2 (1.2%) subjects each in the OCA group: angina pectoris, 
cerebrovascular accident, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and 
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.  
A total of 9 subjects in the OCA group reported cardiovascular SAEs of special interest. Of these, the 
majority were considered not related or unlikely related to investigational product. Two subjects in the 
OCA  group  reported  cardiovascular  SAEs  of  special  interest  that  were  considered  possibly  related  to 
investigational product.

Adjudicated Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events  
All  suspected  MACE,  including  cardiovascular  death,  myocardial  infarction,  and  stroke  were 
independently adjudicated in a blinded fashion. In the Safety population, 4 (2.4%) subjects in the OCA 
group reported a MACE. The median time to first occurrence of MACE in the OCA group was 394.5 days 
(p-value=0.045). None of the subjects in the placebo group had a MACE. Overall, 2 subjects in the OCA 
group (173003 and 263002) experienced a MACE (cerebrovascular accident and myocardial infarction, 
respectively)  that  were  considered  possibly  related  by  the  Investigator.  Two  subjects  (297001  and 
164005) had SAEs of subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebrovascular accident that were considered not 
related or unlikely related by the Investigator (Table 68). 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 64/319 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
In patients with compensated disease, the incidence rate for adjudicated events for Core major adverse 
cardiovascular events (MACE) was low (2 patients in the OCA group and none in the placebo group). Of 
these, 1 patient in the OCA group experienced a cerebrovascular accident which was considered possibly 
related by the Investigator and resolved. 
Dyslipidaemias 
Overall,  6  (3.6%)  subjects  in  the  OCA  and  9  (5.4%)  subjects  in  the  placebo  groups  reported  a 
dyslipidaemia treatment-emergent AESI (Table 70). The incidence of low-density lipoprotein increased 
only  occurred  in  the  OCA  group  (2  [1.2%]  subjects).  None  of  the  reported  dyslipidaemia  treatment-
emergent AESIs were considered SAEs.  
Cholecystitis/cholelithiasis 
There  is  a  biological  plausibility  for  an  association  between  OCA  exposure  and  the  development  or 
exacerbation  of  gallstones:  increased  lithogenicity  of  bile  secondary  to  chronic  FXR  activation  due  to 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 65/319 
 
  
 
 
 
 
higher  cholesterol  supersaturation  resulting  from  decreased  bile  acid  concentration  in  gallbladder  bile 
(Al-Dury 2019).  
In  the  overall  safety  population,  9  (5.4%)  subjects in  the  OCA  and  9  (5.4%)  subjects  in  the  placebo 
groups  reported  a  cholecystitis/cholelithiasis  treatment-emergent  AESI  (Table  69).  The  incidence  of 
cholelithiasis  was  higher  in  the  OCA  group  (7  [4.2%]  subjects)  than  the  placebo  group  (4  [2.4%] 
subjects). A total of 5 subjects reported cholecystitis/cholelithiasis SAEs of special interest. Of these, 3 
subjects in the OCA group reported cholelithiasis, bile duct stone, and cholecystitis acute and 2 subjects 
in the placebo group reported an SAE of cholecystitis. 
In  patients  with  compensated  disease,  5.1%  OCA-treated  and  6.2%  placebo-treated  patients 
experienced a cholecystitis/cholelithiasis TEAEs. Of these, 4 patients reported cholecystitis/cholelithiasis 
SAEs (3 patients in the OCA group: 2 patients with cholelithiasis and 1 patient with bile duct stone; 1 
patient in the placebo group with cholecystitis). Of the 4 SAEs reported in the compensated group, 1 
patient  in  the  OCA  group  reported  an  SAE  (bile  duct  stone)  that  was  considered  possibly  related  to 
investigational product. The total number of treatment-emergent cholecystitis/cholelithiasis AESIs was 
too small to make definitive conclusions. 
Liver injury 
Hepatic failure, sometimes fatal or resulting in liver transplant, has been reported with OCA treatment 
in  patients  with  PBC  with  decompensated  or  compensated  disease.  Accordingly,  per  the  CCDS  v.2.0 
dated 01Jun2021 and v.3.0 dated 03Aug2021, Ocaliva is contraindicated in patients with decompensated 
cirrhosis  (e.g.,  CP-B  or  -C)  or  a  prior  decompensation  event  and  in  patients  with  complete  biliary 
obstruction. In the EU, Ocaliva is also contraindicated in patients with decompensated cirrhosis or a prior 
decompensation event (e.g., ascites, jaundice, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy) per the SmPC.  
In  the  overall  safety  population,  80  (47.6%)  subjects  in  the  OCA  and  97  (58.4%)  subjects  in  the 
placebo groups reported a hepatic treatment-emergent AESI (Table 71). The majority of hepatic AESIs 
(≥10% of OCA-treated subjects) were blood bilirubin increased (including blood bilirubin increased PT 
and hyperbilirubinemia PT), varices oesophageal, and ascites. The incidence of hepatic AESIs of portal 
hypertensive  gastropathy  and  DILI  was  higher  in  the  OCA  group  (14  [8.3%]  subjects  and  4  [2.4%] 
subjects,  respectively)  than  the  placebo  group  (7  [4.2%]  subjects  and  0  subjects,  respectively).  The 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 66/319 
 
  
 
 
 
majority  of  the  hepatic  AESIs  in  the  OCA  group  were  considered  not  related  and  did  not  lead  to 
discontinuation of investigational product. 
In patients with compensated disease in Study 747-302, 42.6% patients in the OCA and 56.6% 
patients  in  the  placebo  groups  reported  a  hepatic  TEAEs.  The  incidence  of  hepatic  AESIs  of  portal 
hypertensive gastropathy and drug-induced liver injury (DILI) was higher in the OCA group (14 [8.3%] 
subjects and 4 [2.4%] subjects, respectively) than the placebo group (7 [4.2%] subjects and 0 subjects, 
respectively). The majority of the hepatic AESIs in the OCA group were considered not related and did 
not lead to discontinuation of investigational product.   
Liver Transplants and Deaths  
In the Safety Population, a total of 7 (4.2%) subjects in the OCA group and 2 (1.2%) subjects in the 
placebo group experienced a liver transplant or death during treatment or within 30 days of the reporting 
period. All liver transplants and deaths were independently adjudicated in a blinded manner by a Hepatic 
Safety Adjudication Committee (HSAC), also referred to as the Hepatic Outcomes Committee. 
In the ITT Population, 32 subjects in the OCA group and 28 subjects in the placebo group experienced a 
liver transplant or death (Table 35). Overall, 4 (12.5%) subjects in the OCA group and 1 (3.6%) subject 
in the placebo group experienced a liver transplant or death event that was assessed as possibly related 
by the HSAC. A total of 9 subjects in the OCA group and 4 subjects in the placebo group experienced a 
liver transplant or death event within 90 days of last dose of investigational product. Of these, 1 (11.1%) 
subject in the OCA group and 1 (25%) subject in the placebo group experienced a liver transplant or 
death event that was assessed as possibly related to investigational product by the HSAC. A total of 11 
subjects in the OCA group and 2 subjects in the placebo group who were on-label per USPI experienced 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 67/319 
 
  
 
 
 
a liver transplant or death event during the study. Of these, 3 subjects in the OCA group experienced a 
liver  transplant  or  death  event  within  90  days  of  last  dose  of  investigational  product,  which  were  all 
assessed as unlikely related by the HSAC. A total of 20 subjects in the OCA group and 14 subjects in the 
placebo group with compensated disease experienced a liver transplant or death event during the study. 
Of these, 1 (16.7%) subject in the OCA group experienced a liver transplant or death event within 90 
days of last dose of investigational product, which was assessed as possibly related to investigational 
product  by  the  HSAC.  All  liver  transplant  or  death  events  experienced  by  subjects  with  compensated 
cirrhosis in the placebo group were assessed as unlikely related to investigational product. 
A total of 60 liver transplants and deaths in patients overall were retrospectively adjudicated in a blinded 
manner by an independent Hepatic Safety Adjudication Committee (HSAC). Of these, slightly less than 
half (26 patients) occurred in patients with decompensated liver disease at baseline. Of the remaining 
34 patients with compensated liver disease, 14 occurred in the placebo group and 20 occurred in the 
OCA group. All liver transplants and deaths in the placebo group were assessed as unlikely related to 
investigational product by the HSAC. Of the 20 patients with compensated disease in the OCA group, 17 
were  assessed  as  unlikely  related  to  investigational  product,  and  3  as  possibly  related  by  the  HSAC. 
Upon patient level review, 1 of the 3 patients had ascites on ultrasound imaging prior to baseline and 
the patient would be considered contraindicated by the SmPC due to decompensated cirrhosis.  
Renal 
Overall, 17 (10.1%) subjects in the OCA and 13 (7.8%) subjects in the placebo groups reported a renal 
treatment-emergent  AESI  (Table  73).  The  distribution  of  renal  AESIs  was  similar  across  treatment 
groups, with none of the TEAEs occurring in >3% of subjects by PT. The incidence of acute kidney injury, 
hypoalbuminemia,  hyponatremia,  proteinuria,  and  thrombotic  thrombocytopenic  purpura  was  slightly 
higher in the OCA group than the placebo group.  
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 68/319 
 
  
 
 
 
 
While nonclinical evidence indicates that FXR activation, including by OCA, may have anti-fibrotic and 
renoprotective effects (Jiang 2007, Wang 2009, Levi 2011, Hu 2012, Bae 2014, Gai 2016), it has been 
reported that exposure to OCA was associated with a small reduction in estimated glomerular filtration 
rate (eGFR) in a NASH clinical study (Corey 2016). Similar to the results in the general safety population, 
in patients with compensated disease at Baseline, 8.8% OCA-treated and 6.2% placebo-treated patients 
experienced a renal AESI. The incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) was low across treatment groups, 
but numerically higher in OCA treated groups (2.2% in the OCA group and 1.6% in the placebo group). 
A total of 3 patients in the OCA group and 1 patient in the placebo group experienced an AKI, which 
were all considered not related to investigational product by the Investigator. With the exception of AKI, 
frequency of any individual renal AESI was 2 or less (maximum 1.5%).  
Overall, the distribution of renal TEAEs was similar across treatment groups, with none of the individual 
TEAEs occurring in >3% of patients. The majority of patients overall had normal albumin and creatinine 
values at Baseline and no clinically meaningful changes were observed overtime. 
Adverse Drug Reactions 
No new significant safety signals have been identified from Study 747-302.  
The most common ADRs (≥5% in any OCA group and at a rate that was at least 3% greater than that 
observed  in  the  placebo  group)  were  pruritus/skin  eruptions,  fatigue/tiredness,  abdominal  pain  and 
discomfort, oropharyngeal pain, arthralgia, procedural pain, oedema peripheral, palpitations, eczema, 
and pyrexia. 
Serious adverse events and deaths, other significant events 
Deaths  
A total of 7 subjects had a TEAE leading to death (5 in OCA-treated subjects: acute respiratory failure, 
respiratory  failure,  subarachnoid  hemorrhage,  sepsis,  and  lower  respiratory  tract  infection;  and  2  in 
placebo-treated  subjects:  sarcopenia  and  hepatocellular  carcinoma).  All  TEAEs  leading  to  death  were 
considered not related or unlikely related to the investigational product (Table 61). Subjects who died in 
the compensated and on-label per USPI subgroups are briefly discussed below. All other deaths occurred 
in the contraindicated per USPI and/or decompensated subgroups. Deaths that occurred post 30 days 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 69/319 
 
  
 
 
 
after discontinuation of investigational product were not included in the safety analyses and are discussed 
in more detail in Section 11.1.3.2.  
A female subject with PBC in the on-label per USPI and compensated subgroup died of acute respiratory 
failure on 05 Sep 2016, approximately 10 months after the initiation of OCA. Investigational product was 
withdrawn  in  response  to  the  events  of  lymphoma  and  acute  kidney  injury  with  the  last  dose 
administered on 20 Aug 2016. The death was considered not related to investigational product by the 
Investigator.  
A  male  subject  with  PBC  in  the  contraindicated  per  USPI  and  compensated  subgroup  died  of  lower 
respiratory  tract  infection  on  09  Feb  2017,  approximately  6  months  after  the  initiation  of  OCA.  The 
subject’s last dose of investigational product was on 15 Dec 2016. The death was considered unlikely 
related to investigational product by the Investigator.

Other Serious Adverse Events  
In  the  overall  safety  population,  the  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  SAEs  was  generally  similar 
across treatment groups: 31.5% in the OCA group and 31.9% in the placebo group (Table 62). The most 
frequently reported SAEs (≥3 [1.8%] subjects) among OCA-treated subjects included esophageal varices 
hemorrhage  (4  subjects  [2.4%]),  hepatic  encephalopathy  (3  [1.8%]  subjects),  and  urinary  tract 
infection (3 [1.8%] subjects).  
There  was  similar  exposure-adjusted  incidence  of  esophageal  varices  hemorrhage,  urinary  tract 
infection, ascites, hepatic failure, and edema peripheral across treatment groups. The exposure-adjusted 
incidence of hepatic encephalopathy was higher in the placebo group (5 [3.0%] subjects) than the OCA 
group (3 [1.8%] subjects).  
Other reported treatment-emergent SAEs (2 [1.2%] subjects) among OCA-treated subjects were acute 
kidney  injury,  acute  respiratory  failure,  ascites,  cerebrovascular  accident,  coronary  artery  disease, 
disease progression, hepatic cirrhosis, hepatic failure, edema peripheral, pruritus, sepsis, and thrombotic 
thrombocytopenic purpura.  
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 71/319 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
In  patients  with  compensated  disease  at  baseline  in  Study  747-302,  more  patients  in  the  placebo 
group (31.0%) experienced an SAE than the OCA group (24.3%) (Table 20). These events predominantly 
occurred in 1 patient each for any given PT. With the exception of esophageal varices hemorrhage SAEs, 
which were experienced by 3 patients in the OCA group and 4 patients in the placebo group, each SAE 
was  reported  by  ≤2  patients  suggesting  no  particular  pattern  or  trend  for  SAEs  in  the  compensated 
group.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation of Investigational Product 
Overall,  62  (36.9%)  subjects  in  the  OCA  group  and  45  (27.1%)  subjects  in  the  placebo  group had  a 
TEAE leading to permanent discontinuation of investigational product (Table 64). With the exception of 
pruritus, the incidence of all TEAEs leading to discontinuation of investigational product was ≤5.4% of 
subjects in any treatment group.  
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 73/319 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Pruritus led to discontinuation of investigational product in 19 (11.3%) subjects in the OCA group and 3 
(1.8%)  subjects  in  the  placebo  group.  The  incidence  of  ascites  leading  to  discontinuation  of 
investigational  product  was  higher  in  the  OCA  group  (4  [2.4%]  subjects)  than  the  placebo  group  (1 
[0.6%] subject). All cases of ascites leading to discontinuation of investigational product were observed 
in subjects in the contraindicated per USPI subgroup (4 [4.6%] subjects in the OCA group and 1 [1.0%] 
subject  in  the  placebo  group)  (Table  14.3.1.9.1.1).  Two  subjects  in  the  decompensated  subgroup  (1 
[3.1%]  OCA-treated  subject  and  1  [2.7%]  placebo)  experienced  ascites  leading  to  discontinuation  of 
investigational product; all cases in the compensated subgroup (3 [2.2%] subjects) were OCA-treated 
subjects (Table 14.3.1.9.1.2).  
Of  the  TEAEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  investigational  product  occurring  in  ≥2  subjects,  DILI  and 
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) were reported only in the OCA group (3 [1.8%] subjects 
and 2 [1.2%] subjects, respectively). Two out of 3 cases of DILI were considered probably or definitely 
related to investigational product. The two cases of TTP were considered not related/unlikely related to 
investigational product. 
Adverse Events Leading to Study Discontinuation 
Overall,  29  (17.3%)  subjects  in  the  OCA  group  and  19  (11.4%)  subjects  in  the  placebo  group had  a 
TEAE leading to study discontinuation (Table 65). With the exception of pruritus, which had an incidence 
of 6.5% in the OCA group and 0.6% in the placebo group, the incidence of all TEAEs leading to study 
discontinuation was ≤2.4% for any treatment group.

Laboratory findings 
•  Hematology and Coagulation  
No clinically significant changes over time or across groups were observed with respect to hematology 
and coagulation parameters. Across treatment groups, the majority of subjects were in the normal range 
for platelets. No meaningful differences in shifts from Normal to High or Normal to Low were observed 
for any hematology parameter between treatment groups. 
•  Serum Chemistry 
Already discussed in the efficacy section. 
Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety 
No clinically meaningful changes over time or across groups were observed with respect to vital signs. 
There were no clinically meaningful changes in ECG parameters across the treatment groups. There were 
no apparent differences in the number of subjects in the OCA and placebo groups with new onset clinically 
significant (CS) abnormal ECG results. 
No  clinically  meaningful  changes  over  time  or  across  groups  were  observed  with  respect  to  physical

Elderly population 
No  safety  concerns  specific  to  elderly  patients  have  been  identified  based  on  the  safety  profile  from 
Study 747-302. As PBC is a chronic disease usually diagnosed in the fourth and fifth decades of life, it is

anticipated  that  a  substantial  number  of  patients  in  the  ≥65-year  age  group  will  have  long-term 
treatment with OCA. 
Hepatic impairment 
Per the EU SmPC, Ocaliva is contraindicated in patients with:  
• Patients with decompensated cirrhosis (e.g., Child-Pugh Class B or C) or a prior decompensation event  
• Complete biliary obstruction  
Exposure to OCA and its active conjugates increases significantly in patients with moderate to severe 
hepatic impairment (CP-B and -C), and these patients may be at higher risk of liver injury. 
Renal impairment 
OCA  is  primarily  eliminated  through  the  feces  and  only  minimally  eliminated  by  the  kidneys,  and 
therefore renal impairment was not expected to meaningfully influence the PK of OCA. No specific clinical 
studies have been conducted in patients with PBC who had renal impairment. In a Phase 1 clinical study 
conducted in healthy patients using radiolabeled OCA, less than 3% of the dose was eliminated in urine 
(Study 747-113). These results are consistent with the lack of measurable OCA and its conjugates in 
urine in other previously conducted Phase 1 clinical studies (747-101 and 747-102).  
Per  the  EU  SmPC,  in  a  dedicated  single-dose  pharmacokinetic  study  using  25  mg  of  obeticholic  acid, 
plasma exposures to obeticholic acid and its conjugates were increased by approximately 1.4- to 1.6-
fold in patients with mild (modification of diet in renal disease [MDRD] eGFR ≥ 60 and < 90 mL/min/1.73 
m2), moderate (MDRD eGFR ≥ 30 and < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) and severe (MDRD eGFR ≥ 15 and < 30 
mL/min/1.73  m2)  renal  impairment  compared  to  patients  with  normal  renal  function.  This  modest 
increase is not considered to be clinically meaningful.  
Based on these data, it is highly unlikely that renal impairment will affect the PK or safety profile of OCA 
and therefore no dose adjustment of OCA is required for renal impairment. 
Study 747-401 
Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Number of Subjects (planned and analyzed):  
Planned for inclusion: 50 subjects (25 subjects in the OCA group and 25 subjects in the placebo 
group). Enrolled and randomized: 22 subjects (10 subjects in the OCA group and 12 subjects in the 
placebo group). 
Analyzed: 22 subjects in the Randomized Population, 22 subjects in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) 
Population; 22 subjects in the Safety Population; 6 subjects in the Pharmacokinetic Population, and 12 
subjects in the Non-Covid-19 Impacted Population. 
Safety analyses (adverse events [AEs], exposure to study treatment, clinical labs, electrocardiograms, 
vital signs, and physical examinations) were performed using the Safety Population including by 
treatment groups and pooled across all active dose levels. No inferential comparison of safety 
endpoints was performed. AEs were mapped to preferred terms and system organ classes using 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Version 24.0. Categories of AEs of special 
interest (AESIs) included hepatic (decompensation/disorder), cardiovascular, renal, pruritus, fatigue, 
dyslipidemia, and cholecystitis/cholelithiasis.

In the Double-Blind Phase and Double-Blind Extension Phase, the overall mean duration of exposure to 
study treatment was 296.5 days in the OCA and 233.4 days in the placebo groups. In the Safety 
Population, all subjects in the OCA and placebo groups reported at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse 
event (TEAE) during the Double-Blind Phase and Double-Blind Extension Phase of the study.  
The most frequently reported TEAEs (≥30%) were ascites, esophageal varices hemorrhage, 
pneumonia, urinary tract infection, pruritus, and anemia. The majority of TEAEs in both treatment 
groups were reported to be mild (Grade 1) or moderate (Grade 2) in severity. 
Study treatment or study discontinuations occurred in 5 (50.0%) subjects in the OCA and 5 (41.7%) in 
the placebo groups and study treatment interruptions occurred in 5 (50.0%) subjects in the OCA and 4 
(33.3%) subjects in the placebo group. The most common TEAE leading to study treatment 
interruption was ascites (2 [20.0%] subjects in OCA and 1 [8.3%] in placebo groups).  
A total of 7 (70.0%) subjects in the OCA and 9 (75.0%) subjects in the placebo groups experienced 
serious adverse events (SAEs). In general, the nature of SAEs is consistent with the underlying 
advanced liver disease in this patient population.  
A total of 5 deaths were reported (3 subjects in the placebo group [hepatic encephalopathy, aortic 
aneurysm rupture, and clear cell renal carcinoma] and 2 subjects in the OCA group [multiple organ 
dysfunction syndrome and cardiac arrest]), which were all considered by the Investigator as not 
related or unlikely related to the study treatment. The case of death from clear cell renal cell 
carcinoma occurred within the study period; however, was reported after database lock.  
Overall, 9 (90.0%) subjects in the OCA and 9 (75.0%) subjects in the placebo groups experienced an 
AESI.  
Overall, no subjects had clinically relevant abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) findings at Week 48 or 
Double-Blind Extension Month 12 across treatment groups.  
Several mean baseline laboratory values were out of range, consistent with patients with PBC with 
moderate to advanced cirrhosis. These values did not change meaningfully over time following multiple 
dose administration of OCA or placebo; additionally, no meaningful discernible differences over time 
were noted between OCA and placebo.  
There were no clinically relevant changes from baseline (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and 
weight) in OCA group compared with placebo. No additional physical examination findings were 
observed, and no trends were detected. 
Post-marketing safety experience 
The most recent PSUR/PBRER for OCA (Ocaliva; PBC) summarizes available safety data received by 
the Sponsor from worldwide sources during the reporting interval from 27 May 2021 to 26 May 2022 
(Module 5.3.6, PBRER-08). The estimated cumulative patient exposure from marketing experience is 
over 28000 patient years.  
The currently approved EU Risk Management Plan (RMP; Version 1.3 revised in June 2021) describes 
the important potential risks of liver injury and atherosclerotic cardiovascular events secondary to 
changes in lipids. However, the risk of liver injury was recategorized as an important identified risk 
during the reporting period (CCDS v.3.0). The RMP will be updated to reflect this change at the next 
regulatory opportunity. Additionally, in postmarketing safety reports, liver disorder events have been 
reported in patients taking OCA. Although information for postmarketing reports is often incomplete, 
out of an abundance of caution and in the interest of public health, four ADRs related to liver injury 
were added to the SmPC. The ADRs included: Hepatic failure, Bilirubin increase, Jaundice, and 
Cirrhosis (Module 5.3.6, PBRER-08). 
EMA/528620/2023

The prevention of liver injury in patients with PBC receiving OCA requires a careful assessment of the 
status of the liver disease before OCA therapy starts. Continued monitoring during the course of 
treatment with appropriate dose adjustments is recommended. Updated labeling contraindicating the 
use of OCA in patients with hepatic decompensation, or a prior decompensation event will reduce the 
incidence and severity of the identified risk of liver injury. Therefore, the impact on public health is 
estimated to be low.  
The lipid abnormalities may be managed in patients with PBC receiving OCA, by monitoring and 
managing lipid levels and other CVD risk factors.  
The important identified and potential risks may be mitigated through careful patient monitoring, 
provider education, and patient outreach.  
OCA remains the only approved treatment to meet the medical need of appropriate PBC patients who 
do not respond or are intolerant to UDCA. The benefit conferred by OCA exceeds the important 
identified and potential risks associated with OCA. 
Discussion on safety 
The main source of safety evidence is derived from Study 747-302. In addition, supportive evidence 
from Study 747-301 (LTSE) has been submitted.  
Post-marketing experience is also provided from approximately 4518 patients who received at least 
one dose of OCA in clinical trials, including 634 patients with primary biliary cholangitis.  
OCA Exposure in Study 747-302  
The mean durations of exposure for the OCA and placebo groups in the Safety population (334 subjects 
with PBC, 166 in placebo and 168 in OCA) were 876 days and 745 days, respectively. The mean durations 
of exposure for the subset of patients with compensated disease (265 subjects, 129 in placebo and 136 
in  OCA)  were:  951  days  for  the  OCA  group  (129  subjects)  and  814  days  for  the  placebo  group  (136 
subjects). The mean durations of exposure for patients with decompensated disease were: 561 days for 
the OCA group and 505 days for the placebo group. 
Overall, patients in Study 747-302 reflected an advanced disease population compared to previous PBC 
studies (i.e., 747-301): 69 (21%) patients had decompensated disease at baseline and are considered 
contraindicated per the CCDS and SmPC revision that occurred while the study was ongoing (32 patients 
in the OCA group and 37 patients in the placebo group). The MAH provided the baseline characteristics 
of the patients excluded from the overall safety analysis, confirming that these patients fulfil criteria for 
contraindication  for  OCA  treatment  according  to  the  EU  SmPC.  Patients  with  compensated  disease  in 
Study 747-302 had higher baseline ALP, total bilirubin, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), and 
Rotterdam  criteria  compared  to  patients  in  Study  747-301,  but  a  shorter  duration  of  PBC  (mean  7.7 
years placebo - 7.5  years OCA in Study 302 vs 8.3 years placebo - 8.3 years OCA titration - 9.2 years 
OCA 10 in Study 301) and less patients were on current UDCA use at baseline (87-85% placebo and 
OCA, respectively, in Study 302, vs 92-93% across treatment arms in Study 301).  
The safety population included 334 subjects with PBC, who received at least 1 dose of investigational 
product (166 subjects received placebo and 168 subjects received OCA). Ninety-seven percent (97%) 
of  patients  in  each  treatment  group  received  daily  dose  of  OCA,  while  3%  received  weekly  doses. 
Treatment compliance was not particularly high, with most patients both in placebo (67.5%) and OCA 
(66.1%) less than 80% compliance, which does not speak in favour of a particularly good tolerability. In 
addition, the number of subjects who required decreased dose at least once was higher in OCA treated 
group: 41.0 % in placebo and 51.2% in OCA. A high proportion of subjects in both treatment groups 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 78/319 
 
  
 
 
required dose adjustments at least once, dose interruptions/discontinuations, but this information is only 
presented for CP-B or CP-C patients at any time during the study. The MAH has presented information 
for  the  overall  population  and  for  both  the  subset  of  compensated  and  decompensated  patients  at 
baseline  and  raises  no  concerns.  The  high  proportion  of  patients  that  required  dose  changes  can  be 
explained by the implementation of the approved SmPC posology at the time of MA in the ongoing clinical 
trial 747-302. These changes affected both subjects non-cirrhotic/CPA and subjects with CP B/C, which 
explains the high and comparable results across subpopulations. No relevant differences were observed 
in the proportion of patients requiring any drug holidays, but the actual number of drug holidays required 
in each treatment group has not been provided, what would be an interesting piece of information to 
know about the actual tolerability of treatment. This should be provided (OC). The only exception, where 
a  higher  proportion  of  any  drug-holiday  was  noted,  was  in  OCA-treated  subjects  with  hepatic 
decompensation (56.3% OCA vs 32.4% placebo). These subjects are now contraindicated in the SmPC.  
Overall,  62  (36.9%)  subjects  in  the  OCA  group  and  45  (27.1%)  subjects  in  the  placebo  group had  a 
TEAE  leading  to  permanent  discontinuation  of  investigational  product.  With  the  exception  of  pruritus 
11.3% OCA vs 1.8% placebo), the incidence of all TEAEs leading to discontinuation of investigational 
product was ≤5.4% of subjects in any treatment group. Other AEs leading to treatment discontinuation 
more frequently in OCA vs placebo were: ascites, DILI, and TTP. Similarly, more subjects discontinued 
study due to AEs in OCA treated group: 17.3% vs 11.4% in placebo, mostly driven by pruritus, blood 
bilirubin increased, ascites, jaundice, DILI, cerebrovascular accident, TTP, subarachnoid haemorrhage, 
hypertransaminasemia.  
In the total safety population, higher rates of events were reported for OCA compared to placebo, 
including any TEAE (96.4% OCA vs 95.2% placebo), any TEAE leading to discontinuation (36.9% OCA 
vs 27.1% placebo), any TEAE leading to study discontinuation (17.3% OCA vs 11.4%placebo), treatment 
related TEAE (79.2% OCA vs 66.9% placebo), treatment related TEAE leading to discontinuation (20.8% 
OCA vs 12.7% placebo), severe TEAE (51.2% OCA vs 39.2% placebo) and TEAEs leading to death (3.0% 
OCA vs 1.2% placebo), which is very concerning. Similar rates of treatment-emergent SAE were reported 
31.5%  OCA  vs  31.9%  placebo.  Overall,  162  (96.4%)  subjects  in  the  OCA  group  had  a  total  of  2349 
TEAEs and 158 (95.2%) in the placebo group had a total of 1815 TEAEs. Consistent with earlier studies, 
pruritus was the most frequently reported treatment-related TEAE and the most common TEAE leading 
to discontinuation of investigational product.  
When considering only the subset of compensated patients, the incidence of patients who reported a 
treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was similar across treatment groups: 95.6% patients in the 
OCA group and 94.6% in the placebo group. The majority of TEAEs were mild and moderate in severity. 
The incidence of severe TEAEs was higher in the OCA group (47.1%) than the placebo group (36.4%). 
Treatment-related TEAEs were reported by 78.7% patients in the OCA group and 62.0% patients in the 
placebo group. The incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of investigational product was higher 
in the OCA group (33.1%) than the placebo group (27.9%). Consistent with earlier studies, pruritus was 
the  most  frequently  reported  treatment  related  TEAE  and  the  most  common  TEAE  leading  to 
discontinuation of investigational product. In the compensated group, the incidence of TEAEs leading to 
death was similar across treatment groups (2 patients each in the OCA and placebo group). All TEAEs 
leading to death were assessed by the investigator as not related or unlikely related to investigational 
product. The incidence of SAEs in the compensated group was numerically lower in OCA-treated patients 
(24.3%) than the placebo group (31.0%).  
No major differences in the general safety profile observed in the overall safety population and the subset 
of patients with compensated disease, not totally unexpected considering than this subgroup accounts 
for approximately 80% of the overall population. Indeed, even in the compensated subset of patients, a 
higher  incidence  of  TEAE,  severe  TEAE  (nearly  half  of  patients),  treatment  related  TEAE,  and  TEAE 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 79/319 
 
  
 
 
leading  to  treatment  discontinuation  were  seen  in  the  OCA  treated  group.  The  high  rate  of  TEAE, 
including severe TEAEs and discontinuations due to TEAE speaks against the acceptable tolerability for 
OCA claimed by the MAH.  
The high rate of severe TEAEs both in the general safety population (51.2% OCA vs 39.2% placebo) 
and in the subset of compensated patients (47.1% vs 36.4%) is noted. This is mainly driven by pruritus 
TEAEs, but also by a higher rate of severe gastrointestinal disorders (oesophageal varices haemorrhage, 
abdominal pain, vomiting, melaena, and ascites), infections, hepatobiliary disorders (hepatic cirrhosis, 
hepatic failure), acute respiratory failure, back pain, and cerebrovascular accident are reported in OCA 
treated patients, which is concerning.  
In the overall safety population, like the safety profile in the compensated group, the most frequently 
reported TEAE was pruritus, which had a higher incidence in the OCA group (78.6%) than in the placebo 
group (51.2%). In addition to pruritus, other TEAEs in ≥10% of OCA-treated subjects and were reported 
more  frequently  in  the  OCA  group  compared  with  placebo  included  peripheral oedema  (18.5%  in the 
OCA  group  and  10.8%  in  the  placebo  group);  abdominal  pain  which  includes  the  following  preferred 
terms: Abdominal Pain Upper PT (14.9% in the OCA group and 7.2% in the placebo group), Abdominal 
Pain PT (12.5% in the OCA group and 10.8% in the placebo group) and Abdominal Pain Lower PT (4.8% 
in the OCA group and 1.2% in the placebo group); nausea (14.9% in the OCA group and 12.7% in the 
placebo  group);  headache  (13.7%  in  the  OCA  group  and  12.7%  in  the  placebo  group);  constipation 
(11.3% in the OCA group and 6.0% in the placebo group); and nasopharyngitis (10.7% in the OCA group 
and 8.4% in the placebo group). Overall, higher incidences of AEs by SOCs were reported in OCA treated 
subjects  for  the  following:  skin  and  subctunaeous  tissue  disorders,  gastrointestinal  disorders, 
investigations (BR, ALT, AST increments), nervous system disorders, blood and lymphatic disorders, and 
psychiatric disorders.  
Also a numerical imbalance was seen in the incidence of deaths across treatment groups. A total of 7 
subjects had a TEAE leading to death (5 in OCA-treated subjects: acute respiratory failure, respiratory 
failure,  subarachnoid  haemorrhage,  sepsis,  and  lower  respiratory  tract  infection;  and  2  in  placebo-
treated subjects: sarcopenia and hepatocellular carcinoma). Deaths occurred in both compensated (4 
cases, 2 placebo vs 2 OCA) and decompensated patients (3 cases, all in OCA), were considered in most 
cases not-related (vs 2 unlikely related in the compensated group). 
In  patients  overall,  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  SAEs  was  generally  similar  across  treatment 
groups (31.5% in the OCA group and 31.9% in the placebo group). The most frequently reported SAEs 
(≥3  [1.8%]  subjects)  among  OCA-treated  subjects  included  oesophageal  varices  haemorrhage  (4 
subjects  [2.4%]),  hepatic  encephalopathy  (3  [1.8%]  subjects),  and  urinary  tract  infection  (3  [1.8%] 
subjects).  Treatment-emergent  SAEs  reported  more  frequently  in  OCA  were  acute  kidney  injury  (2 
[1.2%]  subjects),  acute  respiratory  failure  (2  [1.2%]  subjects),  cerebrovascular  accident  (2  [1.2%] 
subjects), coronary artery disease (2 [1.2%] subjects), disease progression(2 [1.2%] subjects), hepatic 
cirrhosis (2 [1.2%] subjects),  pruritus (2 [1.2%] subjects), sepsis (2 [1.2%] subjects), and thrombotic 
thrombocytopenic purpura (2 [1.2%] subjects).  
In patients with compensated disease at baseline in Study 747-302, more patients in the placebo group 
(31.0%) experienced an SAE than the OCA group (24.3%). These events predominantly occurred in 1 
patient each for any given PT. With the exception of oesophageal varices haemorrhage SAEs, which were 
experienced by 3 patients in the OCA group and 4 patients in the placebo group, each SAE was reported 
by ≤2 patients suggesting no particular pattern or trend for SAEs in the compensated group. However, 
the higher incidence of SAEs of hepatobiliary disorders (3.7% OCA vs 1.6% placebo) is worrisome, as it 
is the higher incidences of infections SAEs (5.9% OCA vs 3.9% placebo), and SAEs of cerebrovascular 
accidents  (2(1.5%)  vs  0  in  OCA  and  placebo,  respectively),  thrombotic  thrombocytopenic  purpura 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 80/319 
 
  
 
 
(2(1.5%) vs 0 in OCA and placebo, respectively), acute kidney injury (2(1.5%) vs 0 in OCA and placebo, 
respectively) and pruritus (2(1.5%) vs 0 in OCA and placebo, respectively).  
TEAEs  that  were  prespecified  as  adverse  events  of  special  interest  (AESIs)  in  Study  747-302 
included Cardiovascular, Cholecystitis/cholelithiasis, Dyslipidemia, Hepatic, Pruritus, and Renal TEAEs. 
The overall incidence of TEAEs of special interest was 82.5% patients in placebo vs 90.5% subjects in 
OCA treated groups. The majority reported treatment emergent AESIs were mild or moderate in severity 
(60.8%  subjects  in  OCA  treated  group  vs  59.6%  subjects  in  placebo  reported  M-M  AESIs),  with  a 
numerical imbalance  in  the  incidence  of  moderate  AESIs  disfavouring  OCA  treatment  (29.9%  OCA  vs 
34.3%).  Notably,  severe  treatment  emergent  AESIs  were  reported  by  a  high  portion  of  the  study 
population  in  both  treatment  groups,  but  the  rate  in  OCA  treated  group  is  almost  double  than  that 
reported in placebo (38.7% OCA vs 22.99% placebo). In particular, a higher incidence of cardiovascular 
(9.5% OCA vs 4.2% placebo), pruritus (79.2% vs 51.8%) and renal AESI (10.1% OCA vs 7.8% placebo) 
were reported for OCA treated patients. When excluding patients with decompensated disease, a similar 
pattern is seen: the incidence of treatment emergent AESIs was 88.2% in the OCA treated group and 
79.8% in placebo, with cardiovascular AESIs (8.1% in OCA vs 3.9% placebo), pruritus (80.1% OCA vs 
51.9% placebo), and renal AEs (8.8% OCA vs 6.2% placebo), more commonly reported in OCA treated 
patients.  
-The  incidence  of  CV  AESI  in  the  overall  safety  population  was  9.5%  vs  4.2%  in  placebo.  For  the 
compensated subset, a similar pattern of higher rates of AEs was seen for OCA 8.1% vs placebo treated 
patients  (3.9%).  The  following  cardiovascular  treatment-emergent  AESIs  were  reported  in  2  (1.2%) 
subjects  each  in  the  OCA  group:  angina  pectoris,  cerebrovascular  accident,  coronary  artery  disease, 
myocardial  infarction,  subarachnoid  haemorrhage,  and  thrombotic  thrombocytopenic  purpura,  and 
venous thrombotic  events.  All  suspected  MACE,  including  cardiovascular  death,  myocardial  infarction, 
and  stroke  were  independently  adjudicated  in  a  blinded  fashion.  In  the  Safety  population,  4  (2.4%) 
subjects  in  the  OCA  group  reported  a  MACE  vs  none  patients  in  placebo.  The  median  time  to  first 
occurrence of MACE in the OCA group was 394.5 days (p-value=0.045). In patients with compensated 
disease, the incidence rate for adjudicated events for Core major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) 
was  low  (2  patients  in  the  OCA  group  and  none  in  the  placebo  group).  Although  most  CV  AEs  were 
considered not  related  to OCA  by  investigators,  the  higher  rate  of  CV  adverse  events  in  OCA  treated 
patients, including higher rates of adjudicated MACE, both in the overall safety population and in the 
compensated  subset,  is  worrisome.  Contrary  to  previous  findings,  dyslipidaemia  was  less  frequently 
reported in OCA treated patients in this study. However, no information is presented for changes in HDL 
cholesterol.  The  increased  incidence  of  CV  events,  including  MACE,  in  patients  treated  with  OCA  is  a 
major concern.   
-The incidence of cholecystitis/cholelithiasis TEAEs was 5.4% in both treated groups, but a higher 
incidence  of  cholelithiasis-related  events  was  seen  in  the  OCA  treated  group.  For  the  compensated 
subset, a similar pattern was seen: 5.1% OCA-treated and 6.2% placebo-treated patients experienced 
a  cholecystitis/cholelithiasis  TEAEs.  Of  these,  4  patients  reported  cholecystitis/cholelithiasis  SAEs  (3 
patients in the OCA group: 2 patients with cholelithiasis and 1 patient with bile duct stone; 1 patient in 
the placebo group with cholecystitis). The MAH was invited to present comparative tabulated results of 
these cholelithiasis-related TEAE for the overall safety population vs decompensated and compensated 
patients and discuss if a higher incidence should be expected in patients with a more advance disease. 
Based on the information provided by the MAH, a potential association between treatment with OCA and 
this TEAE appears at least a reasonable possibility and therefore it should be included in the SmPC (OC). 
-The incidence of hepatic AESI was higher in placebo 58.4% vs OCA (47.6%), but a higher incidence 
of  blood  bilirubin  increased,  varices  oesophageal  and  ascites  are  reported  for  OCA  treated  patients, 
including a higher incidence of DILI (8.3% vs 2.4%). For the compensated subset, a similar pattern is 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 81/319 
 
  
 
 
seen: 42.6% liver AESIs in OCA vs 56.6% in placebo, also with a higher incidence of portal hypertensive 
gastropathy (8.3% OCA vs 4.2% placebo) and DILI (2.4% OCA vs 0 placebo), which is of concern as 
these events appear not to be restricted to patients with severe liver disease.  
When discussing the incidence of liver transplant and deaths events (adjudicated by an Hepatic Outcome 
Committee, HSAC), the information provided is quite confusing given the number of analyses conducted 
and lack of tabulated results, but all point into the same direction: a total of 60 liver transplants and 
deaths in the overall safety population were retrospectively adjudicated in a blinded manner by the HSAC 
(32 [19.0%] subjects OCA vs 28 [16.9%] placebo, considered possibly treatment related in 12.5% OCA 
vs 3.6% placebo). Less than half occurred in patients with decompensated liver disease (26), and the 
remaining  34  occurred  in  patients  with  compensated  disease  (20  in  OCA  vs  14  in  placebo).  This  is 
considered  a  matter  of  major  concern,  given  that  the  aim  of  OCA  treatment  is  just  the  opposite,  to 
prevent these clinical outcomes. The MAH was invited to provide these results, tabulated, for the overall 
study  population,  for  the  subset  of  patients  with  compensated  disease  and  also  for  patients  with 
decompensated conditions, and discuss on the clinical relevance of these findings in the compensated 
population bearing in mind that the demonstrated benefit of OCA treatment is limited to ALP reductions. 
However, an increased incidence of liver transplant and death events in OCA vs placebo treated subjects 
is observed across the spectrum of PBC populations analysed and therefore the existing concern remains.  
-Pruritus was significantly higher in OCA (79.2%) vs placebo 51.8% in the overall safety population. 
For  the  compensated  subset,  mild  to  moderate  pruritus  was  the  most  commonly  reported  TEAE.  In 
patients with compensated disease, 80.1% patients in the OCA group and 51.9% patients in the placebo 
group reported pruritus. The incidence of pruritus SAEs was low in the compensated group: 2 patients 
in the OCA group and none in the placebo group. The majority of pruritus events, regardless of severity, 
were experienced within the first few months of treatment. In the compensated group, pruritus events 
led to permanent discontinuation of the investigational product in 12.5% patients in the OCA group and 
1.6% in the placebo group. Among those patients experiencing any pruritus, most were able to continue 
treatment with OCA. Of those patients able to tolerate pruritus and remain on investigational product, 
the majority (approximately 70%) had used some form of management strategy for their pruritus, with 
treatment  interruption  appearing  to  be  the  most  effective  approach.  Management  and  dosage 
adjustment for intolerable pruritus are addressed in the SmPC. 
-Renal AESI were also reported more frequently in patients treated with OCA, both for the overall safety 
population (17 (10.1%) subjects in the OCA and 13 (7.8%) subjects in the placebo groups, with acute 
kidney  injury  reported  by  3.0  %  in  OCA  vs  1.2%  in  placebo  treated  patients),  and  for  the  subset  of 
patients with compensated disease (8.8% OCA-treated and 6.2% placebo-treated patients experienced 
a renal AESI, with acute kidney injury reported by 2.2% in OCA and 1.6% in placebo treated patients). 
In addition, it has been reported that exposure to OCA was associated with a small reduction in estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in a NASH clinical study. The higher incidence of renal events in patients 
treated with OCA regardless of the severity of the underlying liver disease is worrisome.  
The  safety  of  OCA  in  special  populations  deserved  further  discussion,  particularly,  safety  data  in  the 
elderly population should be provided and any relevant differences with previous observations will need 
to be discussed. Same would apply for patients with renal impairment, bearing in mind the increased 
risk for renal events during OCA treatment. The overall incidence of TEAEs, serious & severe TEAEs, AE 
leading to discontinuation and leading to death (tabulated for the different populations analysed) should 
be presented, including a discussion on whether a more toxic and/or less tolerated safety profile would 
be expected in ≥65 years subjects or in subjects with CKD Stage 2/3. A proposal to reflect this information 
in the SmPC Section 4.8 is also awaited. (OC) 
The  MAH  recognizes  there  is  some  potential  safety  risk  given  the  imbalance  observed  in  the  overall 
safety population of Study 747-302 and cannot exclude a contributory role of OCA. Therefore, the MAH 
EMA/528620/2023

has proposed to further restrict the SmPC indicated population to patients with PBC without cirrhosis or 
with  compensated  cirrhosis  who  do  not  have  clinical  evidence  of  portal  hypertension  or  a  prior 
decompensation event. This analysis was not pre-specified and the newly proposed target population for 
OCA is data driven by an otherwise limited subset of early stage PBC subjects of Study 747-302 (68 OCA 
vs  61  placebo).  Thus,  it  is  uncertain  if  the  observed  results  in  this  subset  of  the  study  population 
represent an accurate estimation of their safety profile and thus if a “more benign” safety profile can be 
firmly concluded in them.  
A reduction in the overall incidence of serious TEAEs (in newly proposed indication 18.5% OCA vs 25% 
placebo compared to the overall safety population 31.5% OCA vs 31.9% placebo) and TEAE leading to 
death (1.2% OCA vs 0 placebo in the restricted indication vs 3.0% OCA and 1.2% in the overall safety 
population) in the restricted PBC population is observed, with lower rates of serious TEAEs in OCA treated 
patients.  The  incidence  of  TEAEs  leading  to  death  remains  slightly  higher  in OCA:  3.0%OCA  vs  1.2% 
placebo in the overall population vs 1.2% OCA vs 0 placebo, but the number of events is too limited to 
firmly  conclude.  The  lower  incidence  of  serious  TEAEs  in  the  restricted  PBC  population  is  not  totally 
unexpected  considering  that  most  serious  TEAEs  are  related  to  the  severity  and  progression  of  the 
underlying  disease.  By  contrary,  the  incidence  of  severe  TEAEs  (45.7%  OCA  vs  32.4%  placebo), 
treatment related TEAEs (75.3% OCA vs 55.9% placebo), TEAE leading to IP withdrawal (33.3%OCA vs 
26.5% placebo), to dose reductions (24.7% OCA vs 10.3% placebo), dose interruptions (25.9% OCA vs 
25.0% placebo) or to treatment discontinuation (14.8% OCA vs 19.1% placebo) do not show relevant 
changes  compared  to  those  reported  for  the  overall  safety  population.  Indeed,  most  of  them  remain 
higher  for  OCA  treated  subjects,  which  is  not  reassuring.  Incidence  of  thrombotic  and  cardiovascular 
disorders (6.2% OCA vs 2.9% placebo), renal AESI  (9.9%OCA vs 5.9% placebo), including events of 
AKI and renal failure, cholelithiasis (3.7% OCA vs 1.5% placebo), portal hypertensive gastropathy (3.7% 
OCA vs 0 placebo), DILI (2.5%OCA vs 0 placebo), liver transplant (1 case each in the early stage PBC 
population) or all-cause deaths (8 events in OCA vs 2 in placebo) are still observed more frequently in 
OCA treated subjects compared to placebo treated patients even in the newly proposed subset of early 
stage PBC patients. The number of events is sometimes too limited to firmly conclude, but the imbalance 
observed  in  the  overall  safety  population  remains  in  this  restricted  early  stage  PBC  subset,  which  is 
concerning. Moreover, treatment is associated with significantly high incidences of pruritus (81.5% in 
OCA vs 47.1% placebo, which lead to treatment interruption in 23.5% OCA subjects and pharmacological 
treatment was required by 54.3% subjects in OCA (vs 7.4% and 27.9%, respectively, in placebo). OCA 
treatment in the newly proposed restricted population was also associated with higher gastrointestinal 
disorders (63% OCA vs 50% placebo), including higher rates of severe cases, and fatigue (9.9% OCA vs 
7.4% placebo). All of them may have a significant negative impact in patient´s health condition. It is 
also noted that the similar rates of hepatic TEAEs observed in OCA and placebo treated subjects in the 
newly proposed early stage PBC population raise doubts on the actual benefit of treatment since lower 
rates might have been expected by a treatment aimed to modify the disease progression.  
The incidence of renal TEASIs remains rather consistent across OCA-treated subjects in the overall study 
population (10.1%), and in subjects with earlier stage PBC both compensated (per current SmPC) (8.8%) 
and  proposed  SmPC  indicated  (9.9%),  but  it  is  lower  than  in  decompensated  subjects  currently 
contraindicated per SmPC (15.6%). It is also noted that systematically, the incidence of renal TEASIs, 
including renal events that manifest as renal impairment, is numerically higher in OCA treated group vs 
placebo-groups regardless of the PBC population analysed, i.e., the overall study population or any of 
the restricted subsets of milder PBC subjects. The possible contribution of OCA in the occurrence of renal 
TEASI events, including severe, serious, and fatal events, cannot be ruled out. Incidence rates adjusted 
by exposure time for the relevant renal TEASI events should be provided (OC). 
There is a need to improve information in the SmPC concerning all these risks in Section 4.4 and 4.8. 
The current proposal is insufficient and the justification of the lower rates in the restricted indication is

not accepted(OC). 
Conclusion 
Study 747-302 show a more concerning overall safety profile as compared to that reported in the initial 
submission, given the higher incidence rates of all types of TEAEs overall and as compared to placebo 
treated patients. OCA treated patients showed a higher incidence of TEAEs, severe TEAEs, TEAEs leading 
to discontinuation, and TEAEs leading to death, both in the general safety population and the subset of 
patients  with  compensated  liver  disease,  which  does  not  speak  in  favour  of  a  favourable  and  well 
tolerated safety profile. In addition, the higher rates observed in OCA treated patients for some relevant 
AESI  like  cardiovascular  events  (including  adjudicated  MACE),  renal  events  (including  AKI),  DILI  and 
portal hypertensive gastropathy events, liver transplant and death adjudicated events, both in the overall 
safety population and for the subset of patients with compensated disease are a matter of major concern. 
Even if an apparent less toxic safety profile is seen in the proposed restricted subset of PBC patients, 
taking these results with caution due to lack of pre-specification and potential loss of precision in the 
estimation, still an increased toxicity and poor tolerability of OCA treatment is noted in the subset of 
patients with an early stage, mostly asymptomatic and slow progressive condition. The anticipated long-
term  exposure  in  clinical  practice  and  difficulties  to  identify  and  exclude  patients  at  risk  of  relevant 
events, add further concerns. The acceptability of the identified risks, and remaining safety uncertainties, 
in  an  otherwise  asymptomatic  or  mildly  symptomatic  early  stage  PBC  population,  deserves  further 
discussion considering the demonstrated benefits.

Clinical aspects 
Benefit/risk 
1.  The positive B/R of Ocaliva, originally demonstrated on a biochemical (intermediate) marker, is not 
confirmed  by  the  updated  results  on  relevant  clinical  outcomes  submitted  within  the  current 
procedure. The confirmatory study (747-302) has failed to demonstrate a clinical benefit of OCA 
treatment in reducing the risk of relevant clinical outcomes in patients with PBC, regardless of liver 
disease severity (results consistent for the primary composite endpoint and its components as well 
as for the secondary outcomes and further confirmed by sensitivity analyses). Moreover, external 
control analyses using RWE cannot counterbalance or even overcome failed results of a confirmatory 
RCT. Consequently, the benefit of OCA in the treatment of PBC is deemed not demonstrated.  
A more concerning overall safety profile as compared to that reported in the initial submission is 
shown  in  both  the  general  safety  population  and  the  subset  of  patients  with  compensated  liver

disease.  OCA  treated  patients  had  a  higher  incidence  of  TEAEs,  severe  TEAEs,  TEAEs  leading  to 
discontinuation,  and  TEAEs  leading  to  death;  higher  rates  for  relevant  AESIs  like  cardiovascular 
events,  including  adjudicated  MACE,  renal  events  including  AKI,  DILI  and  portal  hypertensive 
gastropathy events, liver transplant and death adjudicated events. The hepatic and CV AE profile 
appears particularly worrisome. 
Therefore, the benefit/risk of OCA in the current indication is considered negative.  
Safety 
2.  The hepatic and CV AE profile appears particularly concerning. In addition to the broad discussion 
requested above, the MAH should specifically discuss the following:  
a)  The  observed  higher  incidence  of  DILI  and  other  hepatic  AEs  (e.g.  blood  bilirubin  increased, 
varices oesophageal, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy) in OCA treated patients, including 
those with compensated liver disease, is of concern. Please comment, including the possibility 
to implement any risk minimisation measures. 
b)  The higher rate of CV AEs in OCA treated patients, including higher rates of adjudicated MACE, 
both in the overall safety population and in the compensated subset, is worrisome, even if most 
events were considered not related to OCA by the investigators. Contrary to previous findings, 
dyslipidaemia was less frequently reported in OCA treated patients in this study. However, no 
information is presented for changes in HDL cholesterol. The increased incidence of CV events, 
including MACE, in patients treated with OCA is a major concern and deserves further discussion 
on possible associated factors, including changes in lipid parameters among others. 
Other concerns 
Clinical aspects (efficacy and safety) 
Study 747-301 (LTSE) 
3.  Patients randomized to placebo in Study 747-301 crossed over to OCA treatment and all patients 
were followed for up to an additional 5 years (747-301 LTSE). A more comprehensive presentation 
of  the  relevant  efficacy  and  safety  results  (focusing  of  SAEs  and  AESIs)  of  this  study  should  be 
provided. 
Study 747-401 
4.  The MAH is invited to present the safety results for this study in more detail and tabulated, including 
details of the nature of severe, serious TEAEs and AESIs, those leading to discontinuation and to 
death.  
5.  OCA treatment is contraindicated in “Patients with decompensated cirrhosis (e.g., Child-Pugh Class 
B  or  C)  or  a  prior  decompensation  event  (see  section  4.4)”,  due  to  the  increased  risk  of  hepatic 
failure/decompensation events, including fatal cases. Measures have been put in place to minimise 
this risk, i.e. a contraindication in section 4.3 and precautionary wording in section 4.4 of the SmPC 
to include new information about hepatic decompensation and failure, sometimes fatal or resulting 
in liver transplant, occurring with obeticholic acid treatment in patients with PBC with cirrhosis, either 
compensated  or  decompensated.  Section  4.8  (‘Undesirable  effects’)  was  also  updated  to  include 
hepatobiliary disorders in the tabulated list of adverse reactions. It is uncertain if these measures 
are  currently  (effectively)  in  place  in  clinical  practice  and  sufficient  to  minimise  these  risks,  but 
probably it is too early to know. The MAH is invited to comment, and should commit to monitor the

actual effectiveness of this RMM in clinical practice.  
Study 747-302 
6.  The MAH should provide the baseline characteristics of the patients excluded from the overall safety 
analysis of Study 747-302, and confirm that these patients fulfil criteria for contraindication for OCA 
treatment according to the EU SmPC. 
7.  Secondary endpoint analyses show that only a total of 21 (6.3%) of patients enrolled in Study 747-
302 met the primary endpoint as defined in the pivotal Phase 3 Study 747-301 of an ALP <1.67x 
ULN  and  total  bilirubin  ≤ULN  and  ALP  decrease  from  baseline  of  ≥15%.  Indeed,  the  rate  of 
responders was substantially lower compared to that previously reported and this was the case in 
both treatment arms, but rather noticeable in the OCA treated group (OCA 10.1% vs 2.4% placebo 
in  Study  747-302  vs  OCA  34.0%  vs  7%  placebo  in  Study  747-301).  No  statistically  significant 
differences  were  reported,  adding  even  further  uncertainties  to  the  actual  efficacy  of  OCA  in  the 
treatment  of  PBC.  The  MAH  should  present  a  detailed  description  of  changes  in  relevant  liver 
biochemical  parameters  and  explain  the  observed  differences,  considering  that  Study  747-302 
included a more advanced liver disease population likely representative of the actual target in clinical 
practice.  
8.  The MAH justifies the need for the EC group by stating that the validity of ITT analyses depends on 
successfully balancing randomisation and maintaining treatment and placebo allocation throughout 
the trial. Additional arguments are based on the claim that the reported results in Study 747-302 
were underpowered and potentially biased for a list of reasons discussed below. These arguments 
cannot be accepted. Overall, the observed differences in the estimation of the treatment effect for 
the primary endpoint using the primary randomisation and the IPCW, demonstrate the high risk of 
bias  associated  to  the  reported  analyses  based  on  the  weighting  procedure,  as  compared  to  the 
results of Study 747-302. All results based on the EC are considered to have the same problem of 
bias.  Furthermore,  in  addition  to  all  the  issues  discussed  above,  the  analyses  resulting  from  the 
comparisons  with  EC  should  be  understood  in  the  context  of  a  pivotal  trial  in  which  the  primary 
analysis failed, leaving no alpha for confirmatory testing. As a result, any further analyses should be 
considered  exploratory  only.  The  MAH  is  invited  to  further  justify  the  validity  of  these  analyses 
considering the CHMP arguments.  
9.  A  high  proportion  of  subjects  in  both  treatment  groups  required  dose  adjustments  at  least  once, 
dose interruptions/discontinuations, but this information is only presented for CP-B or CP-C patients 
at any time during the study. The MAH is invited to provide this information of the overall safety 
population, and for both the subset of compensated vs decompensated patients at baseline.  
10. The MAH is invited to provide tabulated results of the overall safety profile of OCA in the total safety 
population and in the two subsets of patients compensated and decompensated, to better illustrate 
any existing differences in the safety profile of these patients.  
11. The high rate of severe TEAEs both in the general safety population (51.2% OCA vs 39.2% placebo) 
and  in  the  subset  of  compensated  patients  (47.1%  vs  36.4%)  is  noted.  This  is  mainly  driven  by 
pruritus TEAEs, but also by a higher rate of severe gastrointestinal disorders (oesophageal varices 
haemorrhage, abdominal pain, vomiting, melaena, and ascites), infections, hepatobiliary disorders 
(hepatic cirrhosis, hepatic failure), acute respiratory failure, back pain, and cerebrovascular accident 
are reported in OCA treated patients, which is concerning. The MAH is invited to present the safety 
profile of severe TEAEs for the two subsets of patients with compensated and decompensated disease 
and discuss to what extent any differences at all would be expected. 
EMA/528620/2023

12. Renal AESIs were also reported more frequently in patients treated with OCA, both for the overall 
safety population (17 (10.1%) subjects in the OCA and 13 (7.8%) subjects in the placebo groups, 
with acute kidney injury reported by 3.0 % in OCA vs 1.2% in placebo treated patients), and for the 
subset of patients with compensated disease (8.8% OCA-treated and 6.2% placebo-treated patients 
experienced a renal AESI, with acute kidney injury reported by 2.2% in OCA and 1.6% in placebo 
treated patients). In addition, it has been reported that exposure to OCA was associated with a small 
reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in a NASH clinical study. The higher incidence 
of renal events in patients treated with OCA regardless of the severity of the underlying liver disease 
is worrisome. Please discuss.  
13. When  discussing  the  incidence  of  liver  transplant  and  deaths  events  (adjudicated  by  an  Hepatic 
Outcome  Committee,  HSAC),  the  information  provided  is  quite  confusing  given  the  number  of 
analyses conducted and lack of tabulated results, but all point into the same direction: a total of 60 
liver transplants and deaths in patients overall were retrospectively adjudicated in a blinded manner 
by the HSAC ( ITT population=32 (19.0%) subjects OCA vs 28 (16.9%) placebo, considered possibly 
treatment  related  in  12.5%  OCA  vs  3.6%  placebo),  less  than  half  occurred  in  patients  with 
decompensated  liver  disease  (26),  and  the  remaining  34  occurred  in  patients  with  compensated 
disease (20 in OCA vs 14 in placebo). This is considered a matter of major concern, given that the 
aim of OCA treatment is just the opposite, to prevent these clinical outcomes. The MAH is invited to 
provide  these  results,  tabulated,  for  the  overall  study  population,  for  the  subset  of  patients  with 
compensated  disease  and  also  for  patients  with  decompensated  conditions,  and  discuss  on  the 
clinical  relevance  of  these  findings  in  the  compensated  population  bearing  in  mind  that  the 
demonstrated  benefit  of  OCA  treatment  is  limited  to  ALP  reductions.  The  appropriateness  of  the 
current risk minimization measures deserves further discussion in view of these results. Further, the 
MAH  should  explain  the  differences  observed  in  the  incidence  of  liver  transplant  and  deaths 
adjudicated events between the safety population and the ITT population.  
14. The  incidence  of  cholecystitis/cholelithiasis  TEAEs  was  5.4%  in  both  treated  groups,  but  a  higher 
incidence of cholelithiasis-related events was seen in the OCA treated group. For the compensated 
subset,  a  similar  pattern  was  seen:  5.1%  OCA-treated  and  6.2%  placebo-treated  patients 
experienced 
a 
cholecystitis/cholelithiasis 
TEAEs.  Of 
these, 
4 
patients 
reported 
cholecystitis/cholelithiasis SAEs  (3  patients  in  the  OCA  group:  2 patients  with  cholelithiasis  and 1 
patient with bile duct stone; 1 patient in the placebo group with cholecystitis). The MAH is invited to 
present  comparative  tabulated  results  of  these  cholelithiasis-related  TEAE  for  the  overall  safety 
population vs decompensated vs compensated patients and discuss if a higher incidence should be 
expected in patients with a more advance disease.  
15. The safety of OCA in special populations deserved further discussion, particularly, safety data in the 
elderly population should be provided and any relevant differences with previous observations will 
need to be discussed. The same would apply for patients with renal impairment, bearing in mind the 
increased risk for renal events during OCA treatment. 
RWE 
16. The external comparator analyses cannot serve as a replacement of the negative results from the 
placebo controlled study and are considered purely exploratory. Despite this, the MAH is requested 
to discuss why such remarkable differences are observed between the placebo controlled study and 
the RWE in order to better elucidate the value of these data.

Question on Benefit/risk 
Question 1 
The positive B/R of Ocaliva, originally demonstrated on a biochemical (intermediate) marker, is not 
confirmed by the updated results on relevant clinical outcomes submitted within the current procedure. 
The confirmatory study (747-302) has failed to demonstrate a clinical benefit of OCA treatment in 
reducing the risk of relevant clinical outcomes in patients with PBC, regardless of liver disease severity 
(results consistent for the primary composite endpoint and its components as well as for the secondary 
outcomes and further confirmed by sensitivity analyses). Moreover, external control analyses using 
RWE cannot counterbalance or even overcome failed results of a confirmatory RCT. Consequently, the 
benefit of OCA in the treatment of PBC is deemed not demonstrated.  
A more concerning overall safety profile as compared to that reported in the initial submission is shown 
in both the general safety population and the subset of patients with compensated liver disease. OCA 
treated patients had a higher incidence of TEAEs, severe TEAEs, TEAEs leading to discontinuation, and 
TEAEs leading to death; higher rates for relevant AESIs like cardiovascular events, including 
adjudicated MACE, renal events including AKI, DILI and portal hypertensive gastropathy events, liver 
transplant and death adjudicated events. The hepatic and CV AE profile appears particularly 
worrisome. 
Therefore, the benefit/risk of OCA in the current indication is considered negative.  
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Ocaliva  (obeticholic  acid;  OCA)  received  conditional  marketing  authorisation  (CMA)  in  the  European 
Union (EU) in December 2016 and accelerated approval in the United States (US) in June 2016 for the 
treatment of adult patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) who have an inadequate response to 
UDCA,  or  as  monotherapy  in  adults  unable  to  tolerate  UDCA.  The  initial  CMA  indication  included  PBC 
patients with advanced disease (e.g., hepatic decompensation). 
Approval was based on a pivotal Phase 3 study (747-301), which recruited PBC subjects with early liver 
disease  and  excluded  subjects  with  Child  Pugh  (CP)-B  or  CP-C  cirrhosis  or  decompensated  cirrhosis. 
Study  747-301  demonstrated  a  clinically  and  statistically  significant  sustained  reduction  in  alkaline 
phosphatase  (ALP),  a  surrogate  endpoint  which  has  been  shown  to  significantly  predict  death,  liver 
transplant and hepatic decompensation (Carbone 2013, Lammers 2014). 
Conditional marketing authorisation included two Specific Obligations: 
•  Study  747-302,  a  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study  to  confirm  benefit  based  on 
clinical outcomes such as hepatic decompensation, liver transplant, and death. 
• Study 747-401, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy, safety, 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 88/319 
 
  
 
 
and pharmacokinetics of OCA in subjects with PBC and moderate-to-severe hepatic impairment. 
Both Obligations evaluated a notably more advanced liver disease population than Study 747-301, as 
demonstrated by key inclusion criteria for the three studies: 
• 747-301: ALP >1.67x ULN and/or total bilirubin >ULN but <2x ULN with MELD <15 
• 747-302: ALP >3x ULN and/or total bilirubin >ULN and ≤ 5x ULN with MELD ≤12 
• 747-401: CP-B or CP-C with MELD between 6 and 24 
The rationale to include a more advanced liver disease population in Study 747-302 was two-fold: 
• To enhance accrual of clinical events by enrolling a population with later-stage PBC who were more 
likely to experience liver-related clinical complications during the anticipated 10-year study, and 
• To evaluate the safety and efficacy of OCA in a more severe population than Study 747-301, one more 
consistent with the initial CMA indication. 
In May 2021 and June 2022, the USPI and SmPC, respectively, were amended given the availability of 
new data on the use of OCA in patients with PBC with decompensated cirrhosis or that had a prior history 
of decompensation, specifically addressing the difficulty in differentiation of progression of liver disease 
to  decompensation  from  potential  drug  induced  liver  injury  (DILI).  Patients  with  prior  history  of 
decompensation  were  contraindicated  from  OCA.  Given  all  subjects  in  Study  747-401  had  hepatic 
decompensation, the study was no longer informative for the current approved patient population and 
as such was terminated. 
The revised contraindication also applied to 21% of subjects in Study 747-302, limiting its applicability 
to the current indicated population (i.e., without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis). In December 
2020, the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) recommended terminating Study 747-302 for lack 
of feasibility. The MAH liaised with the EMA and the FDA and, with their concurrence, terminated Study 
747-302 in December 2021. The study ended at 76% of anticipated enrollment, with 96 of the targeted 
127 adjudicated endpoints observed, leaving the study underpowered to detect the proposed treatment 
effect. 
In an attempt to use the data from Study 747-302 collected prior to study termination and to account 
for the feedback from health authorities, the MAH has provided a range of additional exploratory analyses 
on the efficacy and safety of OCA. While the MAH acknowledges the limitations of those analyses to fully 
determine the benefit and risk of OCA, the MAH does believe the analyses provides compelling evidence 
that OCA may offer an important treatment benefit and, importantly, remains safe for the intended use 
in  the  proposed  SmPC  indicated  population.  Further,  the  totality  of  evidence  beyond  Study  747-302 
provides a compelling package of evidence that supports the conclusions drawn by the MAH. 
1.1.2. Bias in Study 747-302 
The MAH committed to conducting a robust clinical outcomes study as part of the CMA to confirm clinical 
benefit of OCA in subjects with PBC. It became apparent during the conduct of the study that feasibility 
issues and bias were present; throughout the conduct of the study the MAH worked collaboratively with 
global health authorities to rectify these issues. Despite these attempts, the Data Monitoring Committee 
(DMC) advised the MAH that Study 747-302 was unlikely to be able to fulfill its intended objectives and 
recommended  that  the  MAH  consult  with  the  relevant  regulatory  agencies  ahead  of  terminating  the

study. The key issues were as follows: 
•  From  Month  6  through  Month  36,  52%  (87/166)  of  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  discontinued 
investigational product prior to an endpoint event, compared to 32% (53/168) of subjects in the OCA 
group.  ALPs  values  at  the  time  of  discontinuation  of  investigational  product  in  placebo  subjects  were 
substantially higher than the ALP for those placebo subjects who remained on placebo. This pattern was 
not observed in the OCA group during the same period (Figure 1). 
• Subjects in the placebo group were more likely to initiate commercially-available PBC treatments than 
those in the OCA group (i.e., Ocaliva, fibrates, or UDCA if not on UDCA at baseline) (Figure 2). 
• Subjects in the placebo group who initiated commercial PBC treatments showed large and sustained 
decreases in ALP within 3 months of initiating second line therapy, as would be expected for subjects 
initiating an active treatment but not expected in subjects on placebo (Figure 3). 
•  Placebo  subjects  who  discontinued  investigational  product  and  who  initiated  commercial  therapies 
continued to be followed and were included in the ITT analyses confounding the randomized controlled 
comparison of two treatment groups. 
•  More  outcome  and  safety  events  were  detected  in  the  OCA  group  in  part  due  to  longer  and  better 
quality of follow up compared to the placebo group, confounding the interpretation of the efficacy and 
safety results. 
Informative Discontinuation of Investigational Product 
The steady decrease in mean ALP in placebo subjects is inconsistent with the natural history of disease 
and  was  not  observed  in  Study  747-301  or  other  clinical  trials  in  PBC  (Hirshfield  2015,  Jones  2017, 
Corpechot  2018,  Kowdley  2018).  The  mean  ALP  decrease  in  the  placebo  group  is  explained  by  the 
placebo  subjects  who  discontinued  investigational  product.  During  the  first  36  months  after 
randomization, 60% (99/166) of subjects from the placebo group discontinued investigational product 
prior to an endpoint event compared to 46% (78/168) of OCA subjects. For these subjects, the mean 
ALP prior to discontinuation of investigational product was 481 U/L for the placebo group and 414 U/L 
for the OCA group. 
As shown in the red open circles and dashed lines (Figure 1a), the subjects who discontinued placebo 
had substantially higher ALP levels than placebo subjects who remained on investigational product. 
As shown in the blue open circles and dashed lines (Figure 1b), ALP levels of subjects who discontinued 
OCA  were  generally  similar  to  those  who  stayed  on  investigational  product.  Only  21  subjects  who 
discontinued OCA in the first 36 months were in a group with substantially higher mean ALP.

Imbalanced Initiation of Commercial PBC Treatments  
Figure  2  examined  investigational  product  discontinuation  in  the  context  of  initiating  commercial  PBC 
therapies. The solid lines show the proportion of subjects initiating commercial PBC treatments (open-
label OCA, fibrates, or UDCA if not taking UDCA at baseline) in the placebo group (red line) and OCA 
group (blue line). This is overlaid on a bar graph showing the absolute number of subjects in the placebo 
(pink bars) and OCA (light blue bars) groups who discontinued investigational product.  
In the OCA group, peak investigational product discontinuation occurred in the first 6 months (n=25, 
14.8%), and was primarily attributed to pruritus (10 of 25, 40%) versus none in placebo. There was 
minimal  initiation  of  non-investigational  product  therapies  in  the  first  6  months  for  either  group.  For 
OCA-treated subjects, initiation of commercial treatments is generally linear from baseline to Month 60.  
In the placebo group, discontinuation increased from baseline and peaked between Month 12 and Month 
24. The rise in subjects initiating commercial treatment closely mirrors the rise in investigational product 
discontinuations; thus, as placebo subjects dropped investigational product, they initiated commercially 
available  PBC  therapies.  As  discussed  above,  the  placebo-randomized  subjects  discontinuing  blinded 
investigational product had higher ALP levels than the placebo-randomized subjects who remained on 
blinded  product.  Over  the  entire  study  period,  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  were  almost  60%  more 
likely to initiate commercially available PBC therapy compared to subjects in the OCA group (HR [95% 
CI] 1.59 (1.02 to 2.50, p<0.05).

Effect of Initiating Commercial PBC Treatment(s) on ALP 
Figure 3 shows the impact of initiation of commercially available PBC therapies on mean ALP. The two 
cohorts of subjects had similar mean baseline ALP values (493 U/L, placebo; 481 U/L OCA). However, 
before initiating commercial therapies, the mean ALP in the placebo group was 590 U/L (red line) versus 
347  U/L  in  the  OCA-treat  group  (blue  line).  These  substantial  differences  strongly  suggest  functional 
unblinding  in  the  placebo  group.  Significant  subject  and  provider  education  regarding  the  strong 
correlation of persistent high levels of ALP with increased risk of negative clinical outcomes, including 
progression  to  liver  transplant  and  death,  made  conduct  of  a  fully  blinded  clinical  study  unfeasible. 
Investigators were not prevented from reviewing real-time ALP values for their subjects, nor from sharing 
those  values  and  the  implications  for  disease  progression  with  their  patients.  Anecdotal  reports  of 
decisions made between healthcare providers and study participants to discontinue blinded therapy and 
initiate commercially available PBC therapy were shared with MAH and regulators. 
In the first 3 months after initiating commercial treatments, placebo subjects had a mean ALP of 484 
U/L  compared  to  a  mean ALP  of  590  U/L  in  the  3  months  prior  to  initiating commercial  treatment,  a 
difference of 106.3 U/L. Subjects in the OCA-treated group who initiated commercial therapies had a 
mean ALP of 280 U/L in the 3 months after initiating commercial treatment compared to a mean ALP of 
347 U/L in the 3 months prior to initiating commercial treatment, a difference of 67.5 U/L. Commercial 
PBC  therapies  were  effective  in  reducing  ALP  in  both  groups  during  the  first  36  months  following 
randomization. Given the known association between ALP reduction and improved outcomes (Carbone 
2013, Lammers 2014), the crossover to commercial therapy could be expected to significantly reduce 
the number of clinical outcome events in the placebo group.

Imbalanced Quality of Event Capture 
In  an  attempt  to  maximize  data  collection  from  enrolled  subjects,  the  FDA  guided  the  MAH  to  follow 
subjects after discontinuation of investigational product, and to include data from these subjects in the 
ITT analyses. Accordingly, the MAH initiated biannual phone follow-up with subjects who discontinued 
investigational product but who remained in the study. 
These requests presented the following challenges: 
• ITT analyses do not account for subjects switching treatment. Rather, these analyses maintain subjects 
in the group to which they were randomized, not allowing for reassignment based upon actual treatment 
received. 
• When there is significant treatment crossover, ITT analyses will underestimate the treatment effect. 
In-person clinic visits with a healthcare professional every 3 months will have a higher sensitivity for 
clinical  outcome  and  safety  events,  particularly  decompensation  events,  and  will  introduce  less  recall 
bias  compared  to  assessments  based  on  phone  calls  every  6  months.  The  MAH  believes  that 
accommodating the FDA request to retain subjects resulted in a disproportionate detection of events in 
the OCA group compared to the placebo group: 
•  A  substantial  and  disproportionate  number  of  subjects  from  the  placebo  group  discontinued 
investigational product. 
• More subjects in the OCA group continued 3-month clinic visits assessed by a healthcare professional, 
while more subjects from the placebo group were followed with the less sensitive self-reported biannual 
phone visits. 
1.1.3. Clinical Benefit 
Obeticholic acid therapy has demonstrated improvements in biochemical markers known to be associated 
with progression of cholestatic disease. 
1.1.3.1. Biochemical Response Benefit 
Subjects recruited into Study 747-301 had milder disease at an earlier stage and are representative of 
patients with PBC currently treated in routine clinical practice. Study 747-302 recruited subjects with

more advanced disease to enhance accrual of clinical events. This is supported by significant differences 
in baseline disease characteristics, the magnitude of change required to achieve biochemical thresholds 
of the primary response criteria in Study 747-301, the time course of ALP and total bilirubin, and real-
world clinical practice patient characteristics. 
As  shown  in  Figure  4  and  Figure  5,  median  baseline  ALP  and  total  bilirubin  values  were  substantially 
higher in Study 747-302 versus 747-301. 
Figure 4 also shows that the percent reduction from baseline required to achieve the target ALP (≤1.67x 
ULN)  or  total  bilirubin  (<ULN)  thresholds  from  the  primary  response  criteria  of  Study  747-301  were 
significantly different between studies. 
Despite  differences  in  baseline  ALP  and  total  bilirubin,  clinically  meaningful improvements  in  ALP  and 
total bilirubin were observed in the OCA group compared to the placebo group in both studies (Figure 
5). The magnitude of improvements in ALP were consistent for the OCA group for both studies, while a 
greater reduction in total bilirubin was observed for the OCA group in Study 747-302 compared to Study 
747-301 (Table 1). 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 94/319 
 
  
 
 
 
As shown in Table 2 patient characteristics from European PBC and OCA registries provide supportive 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 95/319 
 
  
 
 
 
 
evidence  that  the  Study  747-301  subject  population  is  more  representative  of  the  patient  population 
treated with Ocaliva in real-world clinical practice than the Study 747-302 population. The median ALP 
levels of patients initiating Ocaliva in cohorts from Spain, Italy and the UK are similar to or lower than 
baseline ALP levels in Study 747-301. 
Biochemical Response Predicts Clinical Outcomes  
Because of the high rate of treatment cross-over in Study 747-302, an analysis of biochemical response 
and  correlation  with  clinical  outcomes  was  conducted,  independent  of  initial  randomization  status.  As 
shown Table 3, irrespective of treatment group, there was an association between biochemical response 
(based on the Study 747-301 primary endpoint) and improved clinical outcomes (based on the Study 
747-302  primary  outcomes  endpoint).  This  demonstrates  that  changes  in  biochemistries,  specifically 
reductions in abnormal values of ALP and total bilirubin, which are known to reflect ongoing damage in 
progressive cholestatic disease, are predictive of improved clinical outcomes. The HR of 0.23 indicates a 
substantial  reduction  in  the  risk  of  liver  transplant  or  death  in  subjects  who  achieve  the  biochemical 
response as initially described in Study 747-301. 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 96/319 
 
  
 
 
 
 
This  outcome  benefit  was  observed  across  various  established  biochemical  responder  criteria  (see 
response to Question 7).  
Clinical Outcomes Benefit  
The prespecified ITT analysis in Study 747-302 did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference 
between  the  OCA-treated  group  and  placebo  group  on  event-free  survival  for  the  Protocol  Version  6 
composite primary endpoint. The results from the prespecified analyses in Study 747-302 are not valid 
assessments  of  treatment  benefit  given  the  lack  of  adequate  power  due  to  poor  enrollment,  early 
termination for feasibility, inadequate number of outcome events, and systematic bias.  
The MAH agrees that the RWE is not a “replacement” for Study 747-302. Instead, the MAH believes that 
a series of MAH-supported and independent studies provide consistent evidence of clinically meaningful 
OCA  benefit  in  improving  transplant-free  and  event-free  survival  in  patients  living  with  PBC  with 
inadequate  response or  intolerant  to  UDCA,  and  should  be  included  as  part  of  CHMP’s  assessment  of 
OCA  benefit:risk.  The  specifics  of  each  of  the  studies  cited  by  the  MAH  are  included  in  response  to 
Question 16 and are summarized below.  
As presented in Figure 6, the clinical outcomes benefit of OCA treatment emerged as the MAH:  
• 
• 
Performed  analyses  that  addressed  bias,  including  inverse  probability  of  censoring  weighting 
(IPCW) and the inclusion of rescue medication in the primary endpoint  
Performed analyses that examined subgroups excluding subjects with more advanced disease, 
consistent with the current SmPC  
•  Conducted a comprehensive package of real-world studies  
Taken together, the MAH has demonstrated that despite Study 747-302 lacking appropriate power to 
detect a treatment difference and containing significant bias, OCA demonstrates a reduction in serious 
and life-threatening outcome events compared to untreated subjects when focusing on the appropriate 
treatment subpopulation and adjusting for bias.

In additional support, Figure 7 shows the Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves for the 3 real-world studies 
with similar baseline populations of compensated subjects/patients: 747-301 with External Control; 747-
405 and RECAPITULATE. It is noteworthy that the event rates (first occurrence of death, liver transplant 
or hepatic decompensation) of OCA-treated patients from a clinical trial, a US claims database, and an 
Italian  patient  registry  are  nearly  superimposable,  as  are  the  event  rates  from  the  non-OCA-treated 
controls from a global registry, a US claims database, and an Italian patient registry. The consistency of 
both the KM survival curves, as well as the resulting hazard ratios, speaks to the stability of the observed 
treatment effect in a population consistent with the current SmPC.

Benefit Summary 
•  Subjects recruited into Study 747-301 were more representative of the patients currently treated 
in real-world clinical practice.  
•  Study 747-302 recruited a population of PBC patients with advanced disease at higher risk for 
liver-related clinical complications to enhance accrual of clinical events.  
•  Despite  the  advanced  subject  population  and  the  challenges  with  study  conduct,  which 
introduced  bias  and  lack  of  equipoise  into  Study  747-302,  the  biochemical  response  seen  in 
Study 747-302 confirmed the observed biochemical benefit observed in Study 747-301.  
• 
The profound decrease in outcome events noted in Study 747-302 biochemical responders (as 
defined  by  the  Study  747-301  primary  endpoint of  ALP  <1.67xULN  and  total bilirubin  <ULN), 
independent  of  initial  randomization  status,  confirms  the  association  between  ALP  and  total 
bilirubin and improved clinical outcomes.  
•  As the MAH sought to address study bias and the underpowered nature of Study 747-302 via ad 
hoc  analyses,  a  clear  trend  of  improvement  in  clinical  outcomes  is  seen  in  subjects  on  OCA 
compared to placebo. 
•  Data  both  from  MAH-supported  and  independent  real-world  and  historical/external  control 
studies  support  the  findings  of  OCA  benefit  in  Study  747-302  and  further  provide  consistent 
evidence of clinically meaningful OCA benefit in substantial improvements in transplant-free and 
event-free survival.  
o  OCA benefit is consistent across study populations, patient subgroups, study design and 
analysis, and was maintained throughout extensive sensitivity analyses. These 58% to 
71%  reductions  in  the  relative  risk  of  serious  clinical  events  of  all-cause  death,  liver 
transplants,  and  hepatic  decompensation  offer  strong  support  that  OCA  treatment 
provides  a  clinically  meaningful  and  significant  benefit  to  appropriately  treated  PBC 
patients with a positive benefit:risk.  
o  While  MAH  agrees  that  the  RWE  is  not  a  “replacement”  for  Study  747-302,  it  is  our 
position that CHMP should consider these results, in addition to those from 747-302, in 
their evaluation.

1.1.4. Clinical Safety  
In Study 747-302, the safety population (N=334) included all randomized subjects who received at least 
one dose of investigational product (OCA or placebo). The safety population was the primary population 
used for safety analyses, in which only treatment-emergent events (TEAEs) were included (i.e., following 
exposure  to  the  investigational  product  or  within  30  days  after  the  discontinuation  of  investigational 
product).  
Treatment  assignment  was  based  on  the  randomization  scheme  at  baseline.  However,  as  previously 
reviewed,  more  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  initiated  commercially  available  PBC  therapy  (i.e., 
commercial Ocaliva, fibrates, or UDCA) while on study, significantly impacting the ability to appropriately 
characterize the safety of the prospectively randomized, controlled Study 747-302.  
Despite  the  significant  bias  observed  in  Study  747-302,  the  MAH  assessed  the  frequency  of  events 
between  OCA  and  placebo  in  the  overall,  compensated  (indicated  per  current  SmPC),  and 
decompensated  (contraindicated  per  current  SmPC)  populations.  Given  the  subjects  in  these  various 
groups  have  more  advanced  PBC  disease,  and  that  it  will  not  be  feasible  to  establish  the  safety  and 
efficacy of OCA in patients with more advanced PBC, the MAH has evaluated the safety profile in a revised 
SmPC indicated population that maximizes the benefit:risk profile.  
The  MAH  is  proposing  to  revise  the  SmPC  indication  for  patients  with  PBC  without  cirrhosis  or  with 
compensated  cirrhosis  who  do  not  have  clinical  evidence  of  portal  hypertension  or  decompensation 
event.  In  Study  747-302,  149  subjects  met  the  revised  SmPC  indication  and  were  included  in  the 
“proposed SmPC indicated population”.  
Treatment  with  OCA  was  generally  well  tolerated  in  patients  with  PBC  who  met  the  criteria  of  the 
proposed SmPC indication at baseline, and the overall safety profile was consistent with that observed 
in other PBC studies that excluded patients with more severe disease. The incidence of most treatment-
emergent adverse events of special interest (TEAESIs) observed in OCA-treated subjects was markedly 
lower in the proposed SmPC indicated population compared to the overall safety population.  
1.1.4.1. Overview of TEAEs  
An  overview  of  TEAEs  by  overall,  compensated  (indicated  per  current  SmPC),  and  proposed  SmPC 
indicated populations is presented in Table 4.  
In comparison to the overall and compensated (indicated per current SmPC) populations, the proportion 
of serious TEAEs across treatment groups was lower in the proposed SmPC indicated population.  
In the proposed SmPC indicated population (N=149), a total of 15 (18.5%) subjects in the OCA group 
and 17 (25.0%) subjects in the placebo group experienced a serious TEAE. Of which, 1 (1.2%) subject 
in the OCA group reported a TEAE of acute respiratory failure leading to death, which was considered 
not related to investigational product by the Investigator.  
The incidence of any TEAEs was balanced across treatment groups (93.8% in the OCA group and 89.7% 
in the placebo group). Consistent with the overall and compensated populations, more subjects in the 
OCA group than the placebo group experienced severe TEAEs (45.7% versus 32.4%), treatment-related 
TEAEs (75.3% versus 55.9%), and TEAEs leading to dose reduction (24.7% versus 10.3%), which were 
mostly driven by pruritus. Pruritus is a known adverse drug reaction (ADR) per the current SmPC and 
was an adverse event of special interest (AESI) in Study 747-302.

Hepatic Safety  
A  comprehensive  evaluation  of  hepatic  events  was  performed,  including  analyses  of  Investigator-
reported,  hepatic  TEAESIs  (SMQ-based),  evaluation  of  drug-induced  serious  hepatotoxicity  (eDISH), 
adjudication  of  hepatic  outcomes  and  hepatic  safety  events  (e.g.,  potential  drug-induced  liver  injury 
[DILI]) based on a broad set of hepatic trigger events (Investigator-reported TEAEs and pre-specified 
lab thresholds) to determine severity and causality by a blinded, independent adjudication committee.  
A  summary  of  the  MAH’s  comprehensive  evaluation  is  provided  below  and  a  detailed  discussion  is 
provided  in  Major  Objection  2.  Hepatic  evaluations  by  overall,  compensated  (indicated  per  current 
SmPC), and proposed SmPC indicated populations is presented in Table 5.  
The  incidence  of  hepatic  events  observed  in  OCA  group  was  markedly  lower  in  the  proposed  SmPC 
indicated population in comparison to the overall safety population.

The  difference  between  OCA-treated  subjects  and  placebo  is  more  pronounced  when 
considering the incidence of exposure-adjusted hepatic TEAESIs (11.844 per 100 PYs in the 
OCA group and 25.754 per 100 PYs in the placebo group).  
-  No difference was observed between treatment groups of exposure-adjusted hepatic SAEs 
(1.396 per 100 PYs in the OCA group and 1.385 per 100 PYs in the placebo group).

•  Overall Safety Population (N=334)  
More subjects in the OCA group (49.4%) are represented in the normal range for ALT and total bilirubin 
peak  excursions  compared  to  placebo  (35.5%).  Fewer subjects  in  the  OCA  group  met  criteria  for the 
biochemical Hy’s law range (peak ALT >3x ULN and peak total bilirubin >2x ULN) and cholestasis range 
(peak total bilirubin >2x ULN, and ALT <3x ULN).  
• 
Proposed SmPC Indication (N=149)  
− More subjects in the OCA group (60.5%) were in the normal range for ALT and total bilirubin 
peak excursions compared to placebo (45.6%).  
−  Fewer  subjects  in  the  OCA  group  (12.3%)  met  criteria  for  the  biochemical  Hy’s  law  range 
compared to placebo (16.2%). Similar trends were observed for the cholestasis range (3.7% in the OCA 
group and 4.4% in the placebo group).  
Adjudicated Hepatic Safety Events  
As a retrospective assessment, hepatic safety events were identified via a set of biochemical and adverse 
event (SMQ based) triggers per the HSAC Charter. These events underwent clinical review by the HSAC 
of  all  available  data  (medical  history,  concomitant  medications,  vital  signs,  lab  values,  liver  imaging, 
pathology  reports,  and  noninvasive  tests)  for  each  identified  subject  to  determine  liver  injury  status 
(including  causality  and  severity).  The  adjudication  committees  remained  blinded  to  investigational 
product allocation.  
Potential hepatic safety events (e.g., drug-induced liver injury [DILI]) were identified programmatically 
using  SMQ  searches  of  hepatic  AEs,  central  and  local  laboratory  data,  and  investigational  product 
interruption  records  from  the  clinical  database  for  hepatic  injury.  Hepatic  AEs  are  defined  as  events 
included in the Hepatic Disorders SMQ, excluding the following sub-SMQs: alcohol related; congenital, 
familial,  neonatal,  and  genetic  disorders  of  the  liver;  liver  infections;  and  pregnancy-related  hepatic 
disorders.  Events  were  reviewed  in  conjunction  with  evaluation  of  medical  history,  concomitant 
medications,  vital  signs,  lab  values,  liver  imaging  and  pathology  reports,  and  NITs.  Adjudication 
committees remained blinded to investigational product allocation.  
Per the HSAC Charter, all potential hepatic safety events are then assessed for causality (investigational 
product relatedness) and severity based on the Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) index (Table 
6).

•  Overall Population (N=334)  
- 
There were 189 hepatic safety events in 85 subjects in the OCA group compared to 230 events 
in 99 subjects in the placebo group.  
-  Of  those  events,  18  subjects  had  events  positively  adjudicated  as  possibly  related  (n=17)  or 
probably related (n=1) events in the OCA group compared to 8 subjects (all possibly related) in 
the placebo group.  
-  Of the 18 subjects, 12 in the OCA group had events ≥ moderate severity compared to 7 subjects 
in the placebo group.  
• 
Proposed SmPC Population (N=149)  
- 
There were 58 hepatic safety events in 29 subjects in the OCA group compared to 64 events in 
28 subjects in the placebo group.  
- 
The  majority  of  hepatic  safety  events  in  both  treatment  groups  were  mild  severity,  and  the 
potential liver injury events assessed as ≥ moderate severity occurred in fewer subjects in the 
OCA group (10) than placebo group (12).  
-  4 subjects had events positively adjudicated as possibly related in the OCA group compared to 
1 subject in the placebo group. Of these subjects, 2 subjects had events ≥ moderate severity in 
the  OCA  group  compared  to  1  subject  in  the  placebo  group.  Of  the  2  subjects,  1  subject,  a 
female,  was  found  to  have  elevated  transaminases  (ALT  and  AST  >5x  baseline).  Other  liver 
biochemistry  was  stable  and  consistent  with  baseline.  Elevated  transaminases  returned  to 
baseline approximately 1 month after withdrawal of rifampicin and OCA. The Investigator judged 
the cause for the event to be most likely due to rifampicin. The other subject, a female,  was

found to have an elevation in all liver biochemistries (ALT and AST > 5X ULN and total bilirubin 
>  3X  ULN).  She  was  diagnosed  with  cholecystolithiasis  on  Study  Day  49  and  underwent  a 
laparoscopic  cholecystectomy,  subsequently  all  liver  biochemistry  had  improved  significantly. 
The subject was also taking ibuprofen and simvastatin at the time of the event.  
-  No subject with “possible” related potential hepatic events progressed to liver failure, suffered 
accelerated disease progression after the event, underwent liver transplantation or died during 
the study or the follow up period.  
-  All “possible” related potential hepatic events in the OCA group occurred within the first 3 months 
of investigational product, and no uniform pattern of liver injury was present.  
-  No subject had a hepatic safety event assessed as “probable” or “highly likely” by the HSAC, and 
all cases were reversible with discontinuation of OCA.  
Adjudicated Hepatic Outcomes  
All hepatic outcomes (EMA Composite Endpoint and FDA Expanded Endpoint as defined in Table 7) were 
adjudicated by a blinded, independent Hepatic Outcomes Committee (HOC) to determine whether they 
met the protocol-specified endpoint criteria.  
Subsequently, per request from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), all EMA and FDA expanded 
hepatic outcome events underwent additional blinded clinical review retrospectively by an independent 
Hepatic  Safety  Adjudication  Committee  (HSAC)  to  determine  causality  (highly  likely  drug  related, 
probable drug related, possible drug related, unlikely drug related, insufficient information).

 − EMA Composite Endpoint: A total of 1 subject with 1 event of liver transplant in the OCA group and 
1  subject  in  the  placebo  group  with  1  event  of  MELD  ≥15  were  considered  possibly  related  to 
investigational product by the HSAC.  
− FDA Expanded Endpoint: A total of 3 (3.7%) subjects with 4 events in the OCA group and 1 (1.5%) 
subject with 4 events in the placebo group were considered possibly related to investigational product 
by the HSAC.  
−  None  of  the  OCA-treated  or  placebo  subjects  experienced  a  liver-related  death.  No  cases  were 
considered “probable” or “highly likely”.  
Comprehensive  evaluation  of  hepatic  safety  observed  in  clinical  trials  of  OCA  across  indications  has 
informed our understanding of OCA’s potential for hepatotoxicity. The majority of hepatic TEAESIs have 
been  reported  in  subjects  with  advanced  PBC  who  either  had  evidence  of  decompensation  or  CSPH, 
which forms the basis for the proposed SmPC to further restrict the indication. Restricting the label per 
the proposed SmPC indication allows for an improved safety profile.  
Additional analyses of post-marketing data from over 35,000 patient-years exposure show no increased 
hepatic events in patients with PBC treated with OCA.  
Ocaliva Post-marketing Data: Hepatic Events  
There has been no increased risk of hepatic events in post-marketing data. As of May 2023, the estimated 
cumulative global patient-years exposure from marketing experience is over 35,000 patient-years.  
Over the course of the marketed period for Ocaliva, there have been label refinements and changes to 
better  define  the  appropriate  treatment  population  compared  to  those  subjects  with  more  advanced 
disease  that  should  not  receive  Ocaliva  and  should  be  contraindicated.  A  dramatic  reduction  in  the 
frequency  of  hepatic  AEs  being  reported  occurred  as  these  label  changes  per  implemented.  Between 
2017 to 2023, the frequency of hepatic AEs reported per 100-patient years has dropped 30-fold. This 
signals that refinements in the label have worked to mitigate hepatic safety risk with Ocaliva. 
In  Figure  8,  the  frequency  of  exposure-adjusted  incidence  of  hepatic  safety  reports  has  continuously 
decreased since the initial authorization of OCA.  
• 
• 
Prior to the SmPC update in June 2022, the frequency of exposure-adjusted incidence was 
1.3 events per 100-patient-years.  
Following  the  change  in  the  indicated  patient  population,  the  rate  became  0.6  events  per 
100-patient years in 2022, a substantial reduction in the frequency of hepatic safety reports

Liver Transplants or Deaths  
The MAH recognizes the significant imbalance in liver transplant and death events in Study 747-302. In 
the proposed SmPC indicated population: there were a total of 11 subjects in the OCA group (7 subjects 
had a liver transplant and 4 subjects had an all-cause death); and a total of 2 subjects in the placebo 
group (1 subject had a liver transplant and 1 subject had an all-cause death).  
A comprehensive evaluation of liver transplant and death events in the 11 OCA-treated subjects and 2 
placebo subjects was performed to assess the potential increased risk with OCA:  
•  Of  the  11  subjects  in  the  OCA  group,  a  total  of  1  subject  had  an  event  that  was  considered 
possibly related to investigational product by an independent, blinded adjudication by an HSAC 
().  Based  on  an  ultrasound  prior  to  study  initiation  showing  significant  splenomegaly  and  an 
endoscopy report which was equivocal for oesophageal varices, there is a suggestion that the 
subject had portal hypertension at baseline and would have been contraindicated per proposed 
SmPC.  
• 
The remainder of liver transplant and death events within proposed SmPC indicated population 
were adjudicated as unlikely related to investigational product.  
•  Upon subject-level review of Study 747-302, the majority of liver transplants and all-cause death 
events in the proposed SmPC indicated population had alternate diagnoses/comorbidities.  
• 
The  incidence  of  liver  transplants  and  deaths  in  the  placebo  group  from  Study  747-302  was 
substantially  lower  than  any  of  the  other  non-OCA  treated  groups  from  real  world  datasets. 
Meanwhile, the liver transplant and death event rates were consistent across real world datasets.  
−  Real-world evidence (RWE) datasets  
− Over 35,000 patient-years of Ocaliva post-marketing exposure in PBC  
Based on totality of assessments, the MAH concludes that the rate of liver transplant and death events 
in Study 747-302 was not consistent with post-marketing and real-world datasets, previous PBC studies, 
and external control studies. Furthermore, the totality of evidence supports a clinically meaningful and 
statistically  significant  transplant-free  survival  benefit  of  OCA  use  in  the  proposed  SmPC  indicated 
population.  
A  summary  of  the  MAH’s  comprehensive  evaluation  is  provided  below  and  a  detailed  discussion  is 
provided in Question 13.  
Blinded HSAC Adjudication  
The  incidence of  liver transplant  and deaths  was  higher  in  OCA-treated  subjects  with  more  advanced 
stage PBC (i.e., proposed SmPC contraindicated or decompensated [contraindicated per current SmPC] 
populations)  than  subjects  with  earlier  stage  PBC  (i.e.,  proposed  SmPC  indicated  or  compensated 
[indicated per current SmPC] populations). The incidence of liver transplants and deaths was higher for 
OCA-treated subjects in the compensated population (20 subjects) compared to OCA-treated subjects 
in the proposed SmPC indicated population (11 subjects).  
Overall Safety Population  
A total of 32 subjects randomized to the OCA group and 28 subjects in the placebo group had a liver 
transplant or death:  
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 107/319 
 
  
 
 
•  There  were  20  liver  transplants,  13  deaths  (all-cause),  and  3  liver-related  deaths  in  the  OCA 
group and 18 liver transplants, 11 deaths (all cause), and 3 liver-related deaths in the placebo 
group.  
• 
Independent, blinded adjudication by HSAC resulted in 4 liver transplants in the OCA group and 
1 liver transplant in the placebo group that were considered possibly related to investigational 
product. The remaining liver transplant and death events in each treatment group were assessed 
by HSAC as unlikely.  
Proposed SmPC Population  
A total of 11 subjects in the OCA group and 2 subjects in the placebo group had a liver transplant or 
death:  
•  Of the 11 subjects in the OCA group, there were 7 liver transplants and 4 deaths of which one was 
liver related.  
•  Of the 2 subjects in the placebo group, 1 subject had a 1 liver transplant and 1 subject had a death 
(all cause).  
•  One  subject  in  the  OCA  group  had  a  liver  transplant  that  was  considered  possibly  related  to 
investigational  product  by  the  HSAC.  Based  on  an  ultrasound  prior  to  study  initiation  showing 
significant  splenomegaly  and  an  endoscopy  report  which  was  equivocal  for  oesophageal  varices, 
there  is  a  suggestion  this  subject  had  portal  hypertension  at  baseline  and  would  have  been 
contraindicated per proposed SmPC.  
• 
The remainder of liver transplant and death events within the proposed SmPC indicated population 
were adjudicated as unlikely related to investigational product by the HSAC.  
Upon additional subject-level review, the majority of the subjects with a liver transplant or death in the 
proposed SmPC indicated population had alternate underlying diseases and/or causes which may have 
contributed to the outcome. 
EMA/528620/2023

Real-world Evidence/Historical Controls  
The observed imbalance in liver transplants and deaths in Study 747-302 was not valid and reflected 
significant bias, particularly in favor of the placebo group. The MAH undertook 2 additional analyses to 
investigate this imbalance:  
1. A comparison of the placebo group in the proposed SmPC indicated population in Study 747-302 real-
world non-OCA treated patients with PBC, to understand the observed event rate relative to the known 
natural history of PBC.  
2. An analysis of liver transplants in the US transplant registry before and after launch of commercial 
OCA, as the observed significant imbalance in liver transplants associated with OCA would manifest as 
increased transplants in the real world.  
Results presented in Question 13 support the following conclusions:  
•  The liver transplants and death event rates observed in the placebo group in Study 747-302 did 
not  reflect  the  high  event  rates  seen  in  real-world  analyses,  which  was  consistent  in  multiple 
larger datasets.  
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 109/319 
 
  
 
 
 
 
•  The liver transplant event rates observed in the OCA group in Study 747-302 was not consistent 
with the rates seen over time in a comprehensive liver transplant national registry. Remarkably, 
the percentage of liver transplants associated with PBC has decreased slightly over time despite 
the increasing number of patient-exposure years of OCA in the post-marketing setting.  
Post-marketing Data  
As of May 2023, the estimated cumulative global patient-years exposure from marketing experience is 
over 35,000 patient-years.  
•  No increased risk of liver transplant or deaths has been observed in the post-marketing setting.  
•  Cumulatively,  since  marketing  approval  in  2016,  47  fatal  reports  due  to  hepatic  events  have 
been reported, and the majority were reported from patients who would now be contraindicated 
by the current SmPC. Cumulatively, 33 reports of liver transplants (31 with PT of liver transplant, 
and 2 with PT of liver transplant rejection) have been reported.

Cardiovascular Safety including MACE  
A  summary  of  the  MAH’s  comprehensive  evaluation  is  provided  below  and  a  detailed  discussion  is 
provided in Major Objection 2.  
The totality of data from randomized clinical trials, RWE, and post-marketing data does not show a clear 
signal for an increased CV risk associated with OCA. Based on these data, the MAH is not proposing any 
additional risk minimization measures beyond the scope of the proposed SmPC.  
Overall Safety Population  
• 
In the overall population, there were 21 Cardiac Disorder TEAEs among 15 (8.9%) subjects in 
the OCA-treated group versus 14 among 9 (5.4%) subjects in the placebo group.  
Proposed SmPC Population  
•  The majority of Cardiac Disorder TEAEs were observed in OCA-treated subjects at a lower rate 
in the proposed SmPC population.  
•  With the exception of palpitations, no Cardiac Disorder TEAE was reported by > 1 OCA-treated 
subject in the proposed SmPC population.  
•  There was no trend for an increased risk for atherosclerotic CV events such as coronary artery 
disease, angina, or myocardial infarction when evaluating individual CV PTs.  
•  1  (1.2%)  subject  in  the  OCA  group  and  3  (4.4%)  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  reported  an 
adjudicated Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE).  
•  There is no signal for an increased risk of adjudicated CV events. 
Post-marketing Cardiovascular Safety  
•  The cumulative review of the post-marketing reports of atherosclerotic CV events secondary to 
changes  in lipids  did  not alter the understanding of  the  MAH  regarding  CV  safety  for  patients 
with PBC treated with OCA.  
•  No additional risk management measures are considered necessary to address risk associated 
with CV events. As mentioned in response to Question 5, the MAH commits to continue to monitor 
CV events with Ocaliva as a part of Signal detection activity. MAH will report back to the health 
authorities if there is a need for any further amendment in the future.  
Renal Safety  
A  summary  of  the  MAH’s  comprehensive  evaluation  is  provided  below  and  a  detailed  discussion  is 
provided in Question 12.  
The MAH evaluated renal TEAESIs in OCA-treated subjects from Study 747-302 and postmarketing data 
respectively. From the totality of these analyses, the MAH concluded there is no increased risk of renal 
events in the proposed SmPC indicated population.  
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 111/319 
 
  
 
 
Overall Safety Population  
• 
In the overall population, 17 (10.1%; EAIR of 4.159 subjects per 100 patient years) subjects 
had  a  renal  TEAESI  in  the  OCA  group  compared to 13  (7.8%;  EAIR  of  3.804 per  100  patient 
years) subjects in the placebo group.  
•  The  most  commonly  reported  renal  TEAESI  were  Acute  Kidney  Injury  (AKI)  and 
hypoalbuminemia.  
•  Events of TTP point to both renal and cardiovascular SMQs.  
Proposed SmPC Population  
•  8 (8.9%; EAIR of 3.818 per 100 patient years) subjects in the OCA group and 4 (5.9%; EAIR of 
2.877 per 100 patient years) subjects in the placebo group reported renal TEAESIs.  
•  Apart  from  the  PT  of  TTP  which  was  reported  by  2  subjects  in  the  OCA  group  (2.5%),  the 
remaining  renal  events  were  reported  by  1  OCA-treated  subject  (1.2%)  each:  AKI, 
hypoalbuminaemia, proteinuria, diabetic nephropathy, leukocyturia, and renal failure.  
•  None of these reported events were assessed as related with OCA either by investigator or MAH.  
• 
In summary, there was no signal for an increased risk of renal TEAESIs with OCA treatment in 
Study 747-302.  
Post-marketing Renal Safety  
•  The analysis of postmarketing reports suggests that events of renal disease are more consistent 
with renal disease risk factors and natural history of PBC than direct effects of OCA.  
•  The cumulative review of the postmarketing reports did not change the understanding about the 
risk of renal impairment for patients with PBC treated with OCA.  
Other Safety  
AESIs of pruritus, dyslipidemia, and cholelithiasis/cholecystitis are discussed in Question 10.  
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 112/319 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Pruritus  
•  Pruritus is a known adverse drug reaction (ADR) per the current SmPC. The incidence for pruritus 
was higher in the OCA group (82.7%) compared to the placebo group (48.5%).  
•  The majority of pruritus events were mild to moderate and managed with temporary interruption 
of  OCA  treatment  or  use of  medications  such  as  antihistamines  for  control  of  symptoms.  The 
incidence  of  serious  pruritus  TEAESIs  was  low;  1  subject  in  the  OCA  group  and  none  in  the 
placebo group reported a serious TEAESI of pruritus.  
Dyslipidemia  
•  The incidence rate of dyslipidaemia TEAESIs was similar across treatment groups (4.9% in the 
OCA group and 4.4% in the placebo group).  
•  The  most  frequently  reported  dyslipidaemia  TEAESI  was  low  density  lipoprotein  increased  (2 
[2.5%] subjects in the OCA group and none in the placebo group).  
•  No subjects reported serious dyslipidaemia TEAESIs or a TEAESI leading to discontinuation.  
Cholelithiasis/cholecystitis  
•  A total of 3 (3.7%) subjects in the OCA group and 1 (1.5%) subject in the placebo group reported 
a cholecystitis/cholelithiasis TEAESI.  
•  Cholelithiasis was the only PT reported across treatment groups.  
•  All cholecystitis/cholelithiasis TEAESIs were mild to moderate in severity 
Overall Benefit/Risk Assessment  
In  reviewing  the  totality  of  the  data,  including  clinical  studies,  post-marketing  data,  and  real-world 
evidence, OCA continues to demonstrate a favorable benefit:risk profile in the treatment of appropriate 
PBC patients as defined in the proposed SmPC label.  
The MAH has demonstrated that despite feasibility challenges in Study 747-302 and observed bias, OCA 
has demonstrated benefit in biochemical response and clinical outcomes (Figure 6). Data both from MAH-
supported and independent real-world and historical/external control studies support the findings of OCA 
benefit in Study 747-302 and further provide consistent evidence of clinically meaningful OCA benefit in 
improving transplant-free and event-free survival. 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 113/319 
 
  
 
 
The MAH recognizes there is some potential safety risk given imbalances observed in hepatotoxicity in 
the more advanced patients. While this observation was not observed in the post-marketing reports or 
real-world  evidence,  the  MAH  remains  committed  to  ensure  the  safe  use  of  OCA  in  the  appropriate 
patient population. The observed imbalance in safety risk is reduced significantly by excluding the more 
severe  patients,  such  as  those  with  portal  hypertension.  Therefore,  the  MAH  has  proposed  to  further 
restrict the SmPC indicated population to those without evidence of portal hypertension. This will enhance 
the favorable benefit:risk profile for OCA. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Benefits of OCA treatment 
Study 747.302 has failed to demonstrate a statistically significant and clinically relevant effect of OCA 
treatment  in  patients  with  PBC  in  reducing  the  risk  of  relevant  clinical  outcomes,  i.e.  the  primary 
composite  endpoint  of  death,  liver  transplant,  or  hepatic  decompensation  for  the  ITT  population:  HR 
1.01 (95%CI 0.68, 1.51), p-value: 0.954. Notably, the results for the primary endpoint according to the 
liver disease status (compensated vs decompensated) show a numerical increment in the risk of event 
outcomes in decompensated patients treated with OCA (59.4% OCA vs 54.1% in placebo, HR 1.22 [95% 
CI: 0.65, 2.28]), though not statistically significant. By contrary, results were nearly identical in both 
treatment  arms  in  the  subgroup  of  compensated  PBC  patients  (21.3%  vs  21.7%  OCA  and  placebo, 
respectively, HR 0.98 [95% CI: 0.58, 1.64]). Consistent results were observed across the spectrum of 
disease  severity  and  relevant  subgroups  analysed,  and  in  all  the  sensitivity  analyses  conducted.  The 
MAH claims that the results from the prespecified analyses in Study 747-302 are not valid assessments 
of  treatment  benefit  given  the  lack  of  adequate  power  due  to  poor  enrolment,  early  termination  for 
feasibility, inadequate number of outcome events, and systematic bias. 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 114/319 
 
  
 
 
 
The study ended prematurely at 76% of anticipated enrolment, and with 96 of the targeted 127 (67%) 
adjudicated events observed, with 177 subjects ongoing at the time of Sponsor termination based on 
disposition.  The  MAH  claims  that  this  left  the  study  underpowered  to  detect  the  proposed  treatment 
effect. Although this can be agreed to some extent, it is highly unlikely that the observed lack of effect 
with nearly 70% of the planned number of events could have been reverted at all.  
Furthermore,  it  is  argued that  due  to  the  high  treatment  discontinuations  and  cross-over  to  effective 
treatments, which might have been due to unblinding in the placebo group, the study results might be 
biased.  Although  there  could  have  been  some  differences  in  the  timing  of  treatment  discontinuation, 
similar rates of early treatment discontinuation were observed in both treatment arms (81.9% placebo 
vs 72% OCA discontinued treatment prematurely). It is also argued that subjects in the placebo group 
were more likely to initiate commercially available OCA treatment and that subjects in the placebo group 
who initiated commercial PBC treatments showed large and sustained decreases in ALP within 3 months 
of initiating second line therapy, as would be expected for subjects initiating an active treatment but not 
expected  in  subjects  on  placebo.  However,  according  to  the  CSR,  initiation  of  PBC  treatment  with  a 
potential effect on ALP levels occurred in a small portion of subjects, and similar across treatment groups: 
incidence  of  initiating  commercial  Ocaliva  in  the  placebo  group  (15%)  compared  with  the  OCA  group 
(7%); whilst in OCA more subjects started bezafibrate (14% vs 7%), and no subjects started UDCA in 
any treatment group since the vast majority were on or past treatment. Although of a smaller magnitude, 
a  decrease  in  ALP  after  switching  to  commercial  treatments  in  OCA  treated  group  was  also  reported 
(mean reduction 106.3 U/L placebo vs 67.5 U/L OCA). Moreover, no dramatic differences are observed 
between placebo and OCA treatment groups in the actual rate of treatment events while on treatment 
(39.6%placebo vs 35.4%OCA) or after IP discontinuation but still on study (45.8% vs 37.5%), with more 
subjects  having  the  event  in  OCA  after  study  discontinuation  (14.6%placebo  vs  27.1%OCA).  Thus, 
although it can be agreed that the current estimation of the treatment effect might be confounded to 
some extent, should this occur it was in both treatment arms and not just in placebo. Therefore, any 
pot-hoc external comparison to overcome the failed study results becomes invalid.  
Furthermore, the fact that placebo data from RWE show worse outcome results than those observed in 
the  “pragmatic”  placebo  arm  of  the  clinical  trial  raises  serious  doubts  on  its  validity  for  comparative 
purposes. This worse outcome results in the “placebo” external cohorts could only be explained due to 
a  high  unlikely  poor  treatment  management  of  PBC  patients  in  clinical  practice  or,  more  likely,  to 
differences in the actual prognosis of these cohorts. Thus, this underlines why comparisons with these 
external cohorts are not valid and limits their use as supportive evidence in this context. 
So far, the only demonstrated effect of OCA treatment in PBC patients remains limited to quantitative 
reductions  in  biochemical  parameters  of  highly  uncertain  clinical  relevance.  In  the  confirmatory  trial, 
only a total of 21 (6.3%) patients enrolled in Study 747-302 met the primary endpoint as defined in the 
initial pivotal phase 3 Study 747-301 of an ALP <1.67x ULN and total bilirubin ≤ULN and ALP decrease 
from  baseline  of  ≥15%.  Indeed,  the  rate  of  responders  was  substantially  lower  compared  to  that 
previously  reported  and  this  was  the  case  in  both  treatment  arms,  but  rather  noticeable  in  the  OCA 
treated group: OCA 10.1% vs 2.4% placebo in Study 747-302 compared to OCA 34.0% vs 7% placebo 
in Study 747-301. No statistically significant differences were reported. At present, the predictive value 
of changes in ALP has not been demonstrated. The analyses conducted aimed to establish an association 
between biochemical response (based on the Study 747-301 primary endpoint) and improved clinical 
outcomes (based on the Study 747-302 primary outcomes endpoint) cannot be taken as demonstrative 
of  the  predictive  value  of  these  biochemical  changes.  Besides,  the  absence  of  concurrent  changes  in 
histological progression, and the worsening in relevant symptoms like pruritus and fatigue, add further 
uncertainty to the actual clinical benefits of OCA treatment.  
In  conclusion,  the  MAH  has  not  confirmed  that  the  changes  in  biochemical  parameters 
following OCA treatment is associated with a clinical benefit for PBC patients.

Safety Risk 
As initially noted, Study 747-302 shows a more concerning overall safety profile as compared to that 
reported  in  the  initial  submission,  given  the  higher  incidence  rates  of  all  types  of  TEAEs  overall  and 
compared to placebo treated patients. OCA treated patients showed a higher incidence of TEAEs, severe 
TEAEs,  TEAEs  leading  to  discontinuation,  and  TEAEs  leading  to  death,  both  in  the  general  safety 
population  and  the  subset  of  patients  with  compensated  liver  disease.  In  addition,  the  higher  rates 
observed  in  OCA  treated  patients  for  some  relevant  AESI  like  cardiovascular  events  (including 
adjudicated MACE), renal events (including AKI), DILI and portal hypertensive gastropathy events, liver 
transplant  and  death  adjudicated  events,  both  in  the  overall  safety  population  and  for  the  subset  of 
patients with compensated disease were highlighted as a matter of major concern.  
The  MAH  recognizes  there  is  some  potential  safety  risk  given  the  imbalance  observed  in  the  overall 
safety population of Study 747-302 and cannot exclude a contributory role of OCA. Therefore, the MAH 
has proposed to further restrict the SmPC indicated population to patients with PBC without cirrhosis or 
with  compensated  cirrhosis  who  do  not  have  clinical  evidence  of  portal  hypertension  or  a  prior 
decompensation event. This analysis was not pre-specified and the newly proposed target population for 
OCA is data driven by an otherwise limited subset of early stage PBC subjects of Study 747-302 (68 OCA 
vs  61  placebo).  Thus,  it  is  uncertain  if  the  observed  results  in  this  subset  of  the  study  population 
represent an accurate estimation of their safety profile and thus if a “more benign” safety profile can be 
firmly concluded in them.  
A reduction in the overall incidence of serious TEAEs (in newly proposed indication 18.5% OCA vs 25% 
placebo compared to the overall safety population 31.5% OCA vs 31.9% placebo) and TEAE leading to 
death (1.2% OCA vs 0 placebo in the restricted indication vs 3.0% OCA and 1.2% in the overall safety 
population) in the restricted PBC population is observed, with lower rates of serious TEAEs in OCA treated 
patients.  The  incidence of  TEAEs  leading  to  death  remains  slightly  higher in OCA:  3.0%OCA  vs  1.2% 
placebo in the overall population vs 1.2% OCA vs 0 placebo, but the number of events is too limited to 
firmly  conclude.  The  lower  incidence  of  serious  TEAEs  in  the  restricted  PBC  population  is  not  totally 
unexpected  considering  that  most  serious  TEAEs  are  related  to  the  severity  and  progression  of  the 
underlying disease. By contrary, the incidence of severe TEAE (45.7%OCA vs 32.4% placebo), treatment 
related  TEAEs  (75.3%OCA  vs  55.9%  placebo),  TEAE  leading  to  IP  withdrawal  (33.3%OCA  vs  26.5% 
placebo), to dose reductions (24.7% OCA vs 10.3% placebo), dose interruptions (25.9% OCA vs 25.0% 
placebo) or to treatment discontinuation (14.8% OCA vs 19.1% placebo) do not show relevant changes 
compared to those reported for the overall safety population. Indeed, most of them remain higher for 
OCA  treated  subjects,  which  is  not  reassuring.  Incidence  of  thrombotic  and  cardiovascular  disorders 
(6.2% OCA vs 2.9% placebo), , renal AESI (9.9%OCA vs 5.9% placebo), including events of AKI and 
renal failure, cholelithiasis (3.7% OCA vs 1.5% placebo), portal hypertensive gastropathy (3.7% OCA vs 
0 placebo), DILI (2.5%OCA vs 0 placebo), liver transplant (1 case each in the early stage PBC population) 
or all-cause deaths (8 events in OCA vs 2 in placebo) are still observed more frequently in OCA treated 
subjects compared to placebo treated patients even in the newly proposed subset of early stage PBC 
patients. The number of events is sometimes too limited to firmly conclude, but the imbalance observed 
in the overall safety population remains in this restricted early stage PBC subset, which is concerning. 
Moreover, treatment is associated with significantly high incidences of pruritus (81.5% in OCA vs 47.1% 
placebo,  which  lead  to  treatment  interruption  in  23.5%  OCA  subjects  and  pharmacological  treatment 
was required by 54.3% subjects in OCA (vs 7.4% and 27.9%, respectively, in placebo). OCA treatment 
in the newly proposed restricted population was also associated with higher gastrointestinal disorders 
(63% OCA vs 50% placebo), including higher rates of severe cases, and fatigue (9.9% OCA vs 7.4% 
placebo).  All  of  them  may  have  a  significant  negative  impact  in  patient´s  health  condition.  It  is  also 
noted that the similar rates of hepatic TEAEs observed in OCA and placebo treated subjects in the newly 
proposed early stage PBC population raise doubts on the actual benefit of treatment since lower rates 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 116/319 
 
  
 
 
might have been expected by a treatment aimed to modify the disease progression.  
In summary, even if an apparent less toxic safety profile is seen in the proposed restricted subset of PBC 
patients,  still  an  increased  toxicity  and  poor  tolerability  of  OCA  treatment  is  noted  in  the  subset  of 
patients  with  an  early  stage,  mostly  asymptomatic  and  slow  progressive  condition.  Moreover,  it  is 
important to note that this population was not pre-specified but it is data driven and it is comprised by 
a low number of patients. This hampers the proper interpretation of the reported results, as these might 
well  be  biased.  In  addition,  the  anticipated  long-term  exposure  in  clinical  practice  and  difficulties  to 
identify  and  exclude  patients  at  risk  of  relevant  events,  add  further  concerns.  In  the  absence  of  a 
demonstrated clinical benefit, the identified risks, and doubts on the reliability of the estimation, in an 
otherwise  asymptomatic  or  mildly  symptomatic  early  stage  PBC  population,  are  considered  not 
acceptable.  
The MAH has not confirmed the efficacy and safety of OCA in the treatment of PBC neither in 
the  current  indication  nor  in  a  restricted  one,  and  thus  SOB#1  is  not  fulfilled.  As  a 
consequence, the requested variation is not approvable (MO). 
Safety 
Question 2 
The hepatic and CV AE profile appears particularly concerning. In addition to the broad 
discussion requested above, the MAH should specifically discuss the following:  
1.  The observed higher incidence of DILI and other hepatic AEs (e.g. blood bilirubin increased, varices 
oesophageal, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy) in OCA treated patients, including those 
with compensated liver disease, is of concern. Please comment, including the possibility to 
implement any risk minimisation measures. 
2.  The higher rate of CV AEs in OCA treated patients, including higher rates of adjudicated MACE, 
both in the overall safety population and in the compensated subset, is worrisome, even if most 
events were considered not related to OCA by the investigators. Contrary to previous findings, 
dyslipidaemia was less frequently reported in OCA treated patients in this study. However, no 
information is presented for changes in HDL cholesterol. The increased incidence of CV events, 
including MACE, in patients treated with OCA is a major concern and deserves further discussion 
on possible associated factors, including changes in lipid parameters among others. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
In  the  context  of  the  totality  of  evidence  on  the  benefit:risk,  the  MAH  considers  the  safety  profile 
acceptable  with  the  proposed  risk  minimization  measure  to  revise  the  current  SmPC  population  and 
contraindicate  patients  with  decompensated  cirrhosis  (CP-B,  CP-C),  a  prior  decompensated  event,  or 
compensated cirrhosis with clinical evidence of portal hypertension at baseline.  
The  hepatic  and  CV  safety  profile  of  OCA  in  the  proposed  SmPC  indicated  population  improved  in 
comparison to the overall and compensated populations in Study 747-302. Due to the significant bias 
observed in Study 747-302, the MAH has further investigated the safety profile of OCA in over 35,000 
patient-years of Ocaliva post-marketing exposure in PBC. The MAH is also currently conducting a real-
world safety analysis of patients with PBC (Study 747-405).  
The  response  to  the  Major  Objection  is  presented  below  according  to  the  points  highlighted  by  the 
Committee.

Overview of Hepatic Safety Events and Other Hepatic TEAEs  
CHMP asked that the MAH address the “…observed higher incidence of DILI and other hepatic AEs (e.g., 
blood bilirubin increased, varices oesophageal, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy) in OCA treated 
patients, including those with compensated liver disease.”  
A  comprehensive  evaluation  of  hepatic  safety  events  was  performed  in  Study  747-302,  including 
analyses  of  Investigator-reported  hepatic  TEAESIs  (SMQ-based),  and  retrospective  adjudication  of  a 
broad  set  of  hepatic  safety  events  as  triggered  by  Investigator-reported  TEAEs  and  pre-specified  lab 
thresholds,  by  an  independent  adjudication  committee  (data  not  previously  included  in  the  MAA 
submission dated 22 Dec 2022). The adjudication committee remained blinded to investigational product 
allocation and assessed the potential hepatic safety events, assigned likelihood of causality and degree 
of severity, and provided potential etiology for all cases.  
A summary of the hepatic evaluations in Study 747-302 by overall, compensated (indicated per current 
SmPC) and proposed SmPC indicated populations is presented in Table 10.  
In comparison to the overall population, the incidence of adjudicated potential hepatic safety events and 
other  hepatic  TEAEs  noted  by  the  CHMP  in  the  OCA  group  was  markedly  lower  with  no  meaningful 
difference between OCA and placebo treated subjects in the proposed SmPC indicated population. 
Adjudicated Hepatic Safety Events (e.g., DILI)  
• 
Overall Population  
There were 189 hepatic safety events in 85 subjects in the OCA group compared to 230 events in 99 
subjects in the placebo group. Of those events, 18 subjects had events positively adjudicated as possibly 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 118/319 
 
  
 
 
 
related (n=17) or probably related to investigational product (n=1) events in the OCA group compared 
to 8 subjects (all possibly related) in the placebo group.  
Of the 18 subjects, 12 in the OCA group had events ≥ moderate severity compared to 7 subjects in the 
placebo group.  
• 
Proposed SmPC Indicated Population 
There were 58 potential liver injury events in 29 subjects in the OCA group compared to 64 events in 28 
subjects  in  the  placebo  group.  The  majority  of  potential  liver  injury  events  in  both  treatment  groups 
were mild of severity, and the potential liver injury events assessed as ≥ moderate severity occurred in 
fewer subjects in the OCA group (10) than placebo group (12).  
4 subjects had potential liver injury events adjudicated as possibly related in the OCA group compared 
to 1 subject in the placebo group. Of these subjects, 2 female subjects had events ≥ moderate severity 
in the OCA group compared to 1 subject in the placebo group., One subject was found to have elevated 
transaminases  (ALT  and  AST  >5x  baseline).  Other  liver  biochemistry  was  stable  and  consistent  with 
baseline.  Elevated  transaminases  returned  to  baseline  approximately  1  month  after  withdrawal  of 
rifampicin and OCA. The Investigator judged the cause for the event to be most likely due to rifampicin. 
The other subject was found to have an elevation in all liver biochemistries (ALT and AST > 5X ULN and 
total bilirubin > 3X ULN). She was diagnosed with cholecystolithiasis on Study Day 49 and underwent a 
laparoscopic  cholecystectomy,  subsequently  all  liver  biochemistry  had  improved  significantly.  The 
subject was also taking ibuprofen and simvastatin at the time of the event.  
No subject had potential liver injury assessed as probable or highly likely by the HSAC, and all cases 
were  reversible  with  discontinuation  of  OCA.  No  subject  with  possible  related  potential  liver  injury 
progressed  to  liver  failure,  suffered  accelerated  disease  progression  after  the  event,  underwent  liver 
transplantation or died during the study or the follow up period.  
All possible related potential liver injury events in the OCA group occurred within the first 3 months of 
investigational product, and no uniform pattern of liver injury was present.  
Investigator-reported Hepatic TEAESIs  
Overall Population  
A total of 80 (47.6%) subjects in the OCA group and 97 (58.4%) subjects in the placebo group. Of these, 
4 (2.4%) in the OCA group and none in the placebo group reported a PT of drug-induced liver injury.  
Proposed SmPC Indicated Population  
The  incidence  of  hepatic  TEAESIs  in  the  OCA  group  (27.2%)  was  lower  than  in  the  placebo  group 
(42.6%). Of these, 2 (2.5%) in the OCA group and none in the placebo group reported a PT of drug-
induced liver injury.  
The difference between subjects in the OCA and placebo groups is more pronounced when considering 
the incidence of exposure-adjusted hepatic TEAESIs (11.844 per 100 PYs in the OCA group and 25.754 
per 100 PYs in the placebo group).  
No difference was observed between treatment groups of exposure-adjusted hepatic serious TEAESIs 
(1.396 per 100 PYs in the OCA group and 1.385 per 100 PYs in the placebo group).  
Additional analyses of post-marketing data from over 35,000 patient-years exposure show no increased 
hepatic events in patients with PBC treated with OCA.  
Ocaliva Post-marketing Data: Hepatic Events  
There has been no increased risk of hepatic events in post-marketing data. As of May 2023, the estimated 
cumulative global patient-years exposure from marketing experience is over 35,000 patient-years. There 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 119/319 
 
  
 
 
has been a decrease in hepatic reports globally. Between 2017 to 2023, the frequency of hepatic AEs 
reported per 100-patient years has dropped 30-fold.  
Comprehensive evaluation of hepatic safety events observed in clinical trials of OCA across indications 
has informed our understanding of OCA’s potential for hepatotoxicity. The majority of hepatic TEAESIs 
have been reported in subjects with advanced PBC who either had evidence of decompensation or CSPH, 
which forms the basis for our proposed SmPC to further restrict the indication. Restricting the label per 
the proposed SmPC indication allows for an improved safety profile.  
-Study 747-302: Adjudicated Hepatic Safety Events and Other Hepatic TEAEs  
Adjudicated Hepatic Safety Events  
As a retrospective assessment, hepatic events were identified via a set of biochemical and adverse event 
(SMQ based) triggers per Hepatic Safety Adjudication Charter (HSAC). These events underwent clinical 
review  by  the  HSAC  of  all  available  data  (medical  history,  concomitant  medications,  vital  signs,  lab 
values, liver imaging, pathology reports, and noninvasive tests) for each identified subject to determine 
liver injury status (including causality and severity). The adjudication committees remained blinded to 
investigational  product  allocation  and  assessed  the  potential  for  liver  injury,  assigned  likelihood  of 
causality and degree of severity, and provided potential etiology for all cases.  
Potential  hepatic  injury  events  (e.g.,  DILI)  were  identified  programmatically  using  SMQ  searches  of 
hepatic AEs, central and local laboratory data, and investigational product interruption records from the 
clinical database for hepatic injury. Hepatic AEs are defined as events included in the Hepatic Disorders 
SMQ,  excluding  the  following  sub-SMQs:  alcohol  related;  congenital,  familial,  neonatal,  and  genetic 
disorders of the liver; liver infections; and pregnancy-related hepatic disorders. Events were reviewed 
in conjunction with evaluation of medical history, concomitant medications, vital signs, lab values, liver 
imaging  and  pathology  reports,  and  non-invasive  tests  (NITs).  Adjudication  committees  remained 
blinded to investigational product allocation.  
Per the HSAC Charter, all cases adjudicated as potential evidence for liver injury are then assessed for 
causality  (investigational  product  relatedness)  and  severity  based  on  the  Drug-Induced  Liver  Injury 
Network (DILIN) index (Table 11). 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 120/319 
 
  
 
 
Blinded case level assessments of all hepatic events in the overall, compensated (indicated per current 
SmPC), and proposed SmPC indicated populations are presented in Table 12. A listing of the possibly 
related potential liver injury events in the proposed SmPC indicated population are described below and 
presented in Table 13.  
All hepatic events had sufficient information for a causality assessment. There was 1 subject in the OCA 
group and 1 subject in the placebo group with hepatic events that were not assessable for a severity 
assessment.  
The  incidence  of  hepatic  trigger  events  submitted  for  adjudication  was  lower  in  the  OCA  group  (189 
events) than the placebo group (230 events). Similarly, in the proposed SmPC indicated population, the 
incidence of hepatic trigger events was numerically lower in the OCA group (58 events) than the placebo 
group (64 events).  
The  incidence  of  hepatic  safety  events  that  were  positively  adjudicated  as  possible  related  to 
investigational  product  by  the  HSAC  in  the  OCA  group  was  lower  in  the  proposed  SmPC  indicated 
population compared to the overall population:  
• 
38  events  in  17  (10.1%) OCA-treated  subjects  in  the  overall  population  versus  9  events  in 4 
(4.9%)  OCA-treated  subjects  in  the  proposed  SmPC  indicated  population  (brief  narratives  for  these 
subjects are provided below).  
In the proposed SmPC indicated population, the majority of the hepatic safety events were mild (22.2% 
in the OCA group and 20.6% in the placebo group) and moderate (9.9% in the OCA group and 16.2% 
in the placebo group). In the OCA group, 1 subject had a moderate-severe hepatic safety event (see 
below for mini narrative).  
There were no hepatic safety events in the proposed SmPC indicated population assessed as probable 
or  definite  by  the  HSAC.  The  majority  of  subjects  with  possible  causality  were  using  concomitant 
EMA/528620/2023

medications known to be potentially hepatotoxic at the time of the potential liver injury event and all 
“possible” events were reversible with discontinuation of OCA.  
OCA:  
• 
One  female  subject  was  found  to  have  elevated  transaminases  (ALT  and  aspartate 
aminotransferase [AST] >5x baseline) on 02 Aug 2017 (Study Day 92). Other liver biochemistry was 
stable  and  consistent  with  baseline.  Concomitant  and  potential  hepatotoxic  medication  included 
rifampicin, which was initiated on Study Day 15. Rifampicin and investigational product were stopped, 
and  the  subject  was  admitted  for  a  liver  biopsy.  Synthetic  liver  function  remained  normal,  and  no 
subsequent endpoint was reached. Elevated transaminases returned to baseline approximately 1 month 
after withdrawal of rifampicin and OCA. The Investigator judged the cause of the potential liver injury 
event to be most likely rifampicin.  
• 
One female subject was found to have an elevation in all liver biochemistries (ALT and AST >5x 
ULN and total bilirubin >3x ULN) on 22 Jun 2018 (Study Day 80). The subject had been diagnosed with 
cholecystolithiasis on 22 May 2018 (Study Day 49). It is unclear from the documentation whether there 
were any gallstone-related or obstructive symptoms. Investigational product was ceased on 22 Jun 2018 
(Study Day 80) and the subject underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy on 02 Aug 2018 (Study Day 
121).  On  12  Aug  2018  (Study  Day  131)  all  liver  biochemistry  had  improved  significantly;  no  further 
blood  tests  are  available  for  review  (end  of  study  [EOS]).  The  subject  was  also  taking  ibuprofen  and 
simvastatin at the time of the event.  
• 
One female subject experienced a significant elevation in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (ALP >1000 
U/L  and  >5%  increase  from  baseline)  on  Study  Day  91  with  a  lesser  degree  of  gamma-glutamyl 
transferase (GGT), total bilirubin, ALT, and AST elevation. OCA was dose reduced to 10 mg every other 
day on Study Day 135. ALP remained persistently elevated, and OCA was withdrawn on Study Day 241 
due to pruritis and rash. There was mild improvement in peak ALP after OCA withdrawal, but ALP did 
not  return  to  baseline  and  remained  >1000  U/L  with  a  >15%  increase  from  baseline.  There  was  no 
associated synthetic liver function abnormality and the subject did not reach any endpoint by the end of 
study.  
• 
One female subject experienced a single occasion of elevated ALT, AST (ALT/AST >3x baseline 
and >5x ULN), and GGT, without total bilirubin or ALP changes on Study Day 92. No changes were made 
to OCA dosing. Subsequent labs showed resolution of lab abnormalities without OCA dechallenge.  
Placebo:  
• 
One female subject with an elevation of predominantly GGT (467 U/L from baseline value of 261 
U/L) and total bilirubin (2.5 mg/dL from baseline value of 1.4 mg/dL) with more modest elevation of 
ALT, AST, and ALP on Study Day 104. Investigational product was discontinued and the event was judged 
by  the  Investigator  as  probably  related  to  investigational  product.  Concomitant  medications  included 
rifampicin at the time of the event. Laboratory results after Study Day 104 were unavailable.

Other Hepatic TEAEs  
Other  hepatic  TEAEs  noted  by  the  CHMP  (i.e.,  DILI,  blood  bilirubin  increased,  varices  ooesophageal, 
ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy) are summarized by overall, compensated (indicated per current 
SmPC), and proposed SmPC indicated population in Table 14.  
In  comparison  to  the  overall  and  compensated  populations,  hepatic  TEAEs  observed  in  OCA-treated 
subjects reduced in the proposed SmPC indicated population.  
• 
Blood bilirubin increased: 20 (11.9%) OCA-treated subjects in the overall population, 14 (10.3%) 
OCA-treated  subjects  in  the  compensated  population,  and  4  (4.9%)  OCA-treated  subjects  in  the 
proposed SmPC indicated population  
• 
Varices oesophageal: 20 (11.9%) OCA-treated subjects in the overall population, 16 (11.8%) 
OCA-treated  subjects  in  the  compensated  population,  and  4  (4.9%)  OCA-treated  subjects  in  the 
proposed SmPC indicated population  
• 
Ascites:  18  (10.7%)  OCA-treated  subjects  in  the  overall  population,  9  (6.6%)  OCA-treated 
subjects  in  the  compensated  population,  and  1  (1.2%)  OCA-treated  subject  in  the  proposed  SmPC 
indicated population  
• 
Portal hypertensive gastropathy: 14 (8.3%) OCA-treated subjects in the overall population, 11 
(8.1%) OCA-treated subjects in the compensated population, and 3 (3.7%) OCA-treated subjects in the 
proposed SmPC indicated population  
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 125/319 
 
  
 
 
 
• 
DILI: 4 (2.4%) OCA-treated subjects in the overall population, 3 (2.2%) OCA-treated subjects 
in  the  compensated  population,  and  2  (2.5%)  OCA-treated  subjects  in  the  proposed  SmPC  indicated 
population; Investigator-reported DILI events were adjudicated as described above: 1 subject  with an 
event was positively adjudicated (possibly related; moderate in severity).  
There  were  no  serious  hepatic  TEAEs  of  varices  oesophageal,  ascites,  and  portal  hypertensive 
gastropathy in the proposed SmPC indicated population. There was 1 OCA-treated subject with a serious 
hepatic  TEAE  of  blood  bilirubin  that  was  considered  unlikely  related  to  investigational  product  by  the 
Investigator and 1 OCA-treated subject with a serious hepatic TEAE of DILI (Section 1.2.1.1.1). 
Ocaliva Post-marketing Data: Hepatic Events  
OCA was granted accelerated approval under the trade name Ocaliva by the US FDA on 27 May 2016, 
and received conditional approval by the European Commission on 12 Dec 2016, by Health Canada on 
24 May 2017, and is now approved in 43 countries for the treatment of PBC in combination with UDCA 
in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA or as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA. As 
of  May  2023,  the  estimated  cumulative  global  exposure  from  marketing  experience  is  over  35,000 
patient-years.  
Over the course of the marketed period for Ocaliva, there have been label refinements and changes to 
better  define  the  appropriate  treatment  population  compared  to  those  subjects  with  more  advanced 
disease  that  should  not  receive  Ocaliva  and  should  be  contraindicated.  A  dramatic  reduction  in  the 
frequency  of  hepatic  AEs  being  reported  occurred  as  these  label  changes  per  implemented.  Between 
2017 to 2023, the frequency of hepatic AEs reported per 100-patient years has dropped 30-fold. This 
signals that refinements in the label have worked to mitigate hepatic safety risk with Ocaliva.  
In  Figure  8,  the  frequency  of  exposure-adjusted  incidence  of  hepatic  safety  reports  has  continuously 
decreased since the initial authorization of OCA.  
• 
Prior to the SmPC update in June 2022, the frequency of exposure-adjusted incidence was 1.3 
events per 100-patient-years.  
• 
Following the change in the indicated patient population, the rate became 0.6 events per 100-
patient years in 2022, a substantial reduction in the frequency of hepatic safety reports. 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 126/319 
 
  
 
 
 
Per the changes now being proposed to the SmPC, OCA would be contraindicated in adult patients with 
PBC  with  decompensated  cirrhosis,  a  prior  decompensation  event,  or  in  patients  with  compensated 
cirrhosis who have evidence of portal hypertension. Although differentiation of progressive liver disease 
from potential drug-induced liver injury relies on clinical assessment by experts, there is an increased 
rate of reported liver safety events in patients with advanced PBC. These advanced patients would be 
contraindicated in the proposed labeling. 
Cardiovascular Safety  
CHMP raises two separate but related issues regarding the CV safety of OCA:  
3. Effect of OCA on CV events, including MACE  
4. Effect of OCA on lipid profiles  
Overview of Cardiovascular Safety  
A comprehensive analysis of CV events was performed based on the CV SOC, evaluating Cardiac Disorder 
TEAEs and SAEs. A separate analysis of CV events based on SMQ criteria was also undertaken. Apart 
from  the  investigator  reported  TEAE  and  AESI  analyses,  an  independent  committee  of  experts 
adjudicated CV events based on capture of a broad set of triggers, including TEAEs, labs (e.g. troponin), 
ECGs, and review of hospitalizations, to provide a rigorous evaluation of CV events. Based on the known 
effect of FXR-agonism on lipids and observed changes in lipoproteins observed in early clinical trials of 
OCA, lipoproteins were measured at study visits. Finally, Framingham risk scores (FRS), a tool used to 
predict 10-year risk for coronary heart disease, was also evaluated at baseline and on treatment.  
In addition, CV events were also analyzed in post-marketing data to further assess any potential CV risks 
in patients with PBC treated with OCA.  
CV Safety  
Overall Population  
A total of 15 (8.9%) subjects in the OCA group and 9 (5.4%) subjects in the placebo group reported a 
Cardiac Disorder TEAE.  
In a broad SMQ of embolic and thrombotic events for CV AESIs, the incidence of overall CV TEAESIs was 
higher in the OCA group (9.5%) compared to placebo (4.2%).  
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 127/319 
 
  
 
 
 
5 (3.0%) subjects in the OCA group and 3 (1.8%) subjects in the placebo group reported an adjudicated 
MACE.  
• 
Proposed SmPC Indicated Population  
A total of 6 (7.4%) subjects in the OCA group and 4 (5.9%) subjects in the placebo group reported a 
Cardiac Disorder TEAE.  
The incidence of CV TEAESIs was higher in the OCA group (6.2%) compared to placebo (2.9%). However, 
there was no trend for an increased risk for atherosclerotic CV events such as coronary artery disease, 
angina, or myocardial infarction when evaluating individual CV PTs.  
Rates for serious TEAESIs were low in both groups; 1 OCA-treated subject reported a CVA event in the 
setting of confirmed TTP; both events were considered unlikely related to investigational product by the 
Investigator.  
There is no clear signal for an increased CV risk based on analyses of the adjudicated CV events in a 
rigorous manner. A total of 1 (1.2%) subject in the OCA group and 3 (4.4%) subjects in the placebo 
group reported an adjudicated MACE.  
Mean FRS was 7% in the OCA group and 9% in the placebo group at baseline. Mean FRS remained <10% 
at Month 12 and Month 42 in both groups.  
Lipid Profile  
• 
Decreases in LDLc over time in both OCA and placebo groups were likely due to frequent use of 
fibrates.  
• 
The  early,  small  decrease  in  HDLc  attenuated  over  the  course  of  treatment  with  OCA  and  is 
unlikely to impact long-term CV risk.  
Ocaliva Postmarketing Data: CV Events  
• 
The cumulative review of the post-marketing reports of atherosclerotic CV events secondary to 
changes in lipids did not alter the understanding of the MAH regarding CV safety for patients with PBC 
treated with OCA.  
In summary, the totality of data from randomized clinical trials, RWE, and post-marketing data does not 
show a clear signal for an increased CV risk associated with OCA. Based on these data, the MAH is not 
proposing any additional risk minimization measures beyond the scope of the proposed SmPC.

Study 747-302: CV Safety  
Cardiovascular TEAEs  
A summary of CV TEAEs by SOC and PT for the overall, compensated, and proposed SmPC is presented 
in Table 16.  
In the overall population, there were 21 Cardiac Disorder PTs among 15 (8.9%) patients in the OCA-
treated  group  versus  14  among  9  (5.4%)  patients  in  the  placebo  group.  The  most  frequent  Cardiac 
Disorder PT was palpitations: 5 (3%) patients in the OCA group versus 2 (1.2%) in placebo (palpitation 
is a known ADR in the SmPC). All other Cardiac Disorder events occurred in <2% of either treatment 
group.  
In comparison to the overall population, 6 (7.4%) subjects in the OCA group and 4 (5.9%) subjects in 
the  placebo  group  reported  a  Cardiac  Disorder  PT  in  the  proposed  SmPC  population.  The  majority  of 
Cardiac Disorder TEAEs were observed in OCA-treated subjects at a lower rate in the proposed SmPC 
population compared to the overall population.  
With the exception of palpitations, no other Cardiac Disorder PT was reported by >1 OCA treated subject 
in the proposed SmPC population.

Cardiovascular TEAESIs and Serious TEAESIs  
CV  TEAESIs  and  serious  CV  TEAESIs  are  summarized  by  overall,  compensated  (on-label  per  current 
SmPC) and on-label per proposed SmPC populations in Table 17 and Table 18.  
CV  AESIs  were  defined  by  the  embolic  and  thrombotic  events  broad  Standardized  MedDRA  Queries 
(SMQ), ischaemic heart disease broad SMQ, or central nervous system vascular disorders narrow SMQ. 
CV  AESIs  captured  a  broad  range  of  atherosclerotic  events  which  are  of  primary  interest,  as  well  as 
several  non-atherosclerotic  events  such  as  venous thrombotic  events  and  TTP,  which  do not  have  an 
underlying lipid-related pathophysiology. TTP was captured for both CV and renal SMQs. For this reason, 
the cases of TTP are described separately under renal AESIs Question #10.  
While the rate for overall CV TEAESIs was higher in the OCA group compared to placebo, there was no 
trend  for  an  increased  risk  for  atherosclerotic  CV  events  such  as  coronary  artery  disease,  angina,  or 
myocardial  infarction  when  evaluating  individual  CV  PTs.  Rates  for  serious  TEAESIs  were  low  in  both 
groups; 1 OCA-treated subject reported a CVA in the setting of confirmed TTP. Details for this case are 
described in Question #10.  
Adjudicated  outcomes  for  CV  events  provide  the  most  rigorous  analysis  of  CV  risk  based  on  a 
comprehensive CV adjudication process. 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 130/319 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Adjudicated Cardiovascular Events  
All suspected MACE, including CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and additional 
CV events were adjudicated by an independent CV adjudication committee in a blinded fashion.  
Potential events were identified programmatically using searches for fatal events, hospitalizations, and 
SMQ based searches for CV TEAEs. SMQ trigger events included ischaemic heart disease, cardiac failure, 
Torsade  de  pointes/QT  prolongation,  arrhythmia  related  investigations,  signs  and  symptoms,  cardiac 
arrhythmia  terms  [including  bradyarrhythmias  and  tachyarrhythmias],  and  central  nervous  system 
haemorrhages and cerebrovascular conditions. Events were reviewed in conjunction with evaluation of 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 131/319 
 
  
 
 
 
 
medical history, concomitant medications, vital signs, prespecified lab values, and ECGs. Adjudication 
committee members remained blinded to investigational product treatment assignment (CAC Charter, 
Version 7).  
Adjudicated MACE is summarized by overall, compensated (on-label per current SmPC) and on-label per 
proposed SmPC populations in Table 19.  
Overall  
Overall, 5 (3.0%) subjects in the OCA group and 3 (1.8%) subjects in the placebo group reported an 
adjudicated MACE.  
Proposed SmPC  
In comparison to the overall population, the incidence of MACE observed in OCA-treated subjects was 
reduced significantly in the proposed SmPC population.  
In  the  Proposed  SmPC  population,  1  (1.2%)  subject  in  the  OCA  group  and  3  (4.4%)  subjects  in  the 
placebo group reported an adjudicated MACE. One subject treated with OCA, reported an adjudicated 
CVA event in the setting of confirmed TTP. Details for this case are provided in Question #10, Section 
2.8.3.4.5. Considering the presentation of stroke in the setting of TTP, it is unlikely that the TTP event 
was related to OCA treatment, consistent with the Investigator’s assessment.  
In summary, when considering the proposed SmPC population, there is no clear signal for an increased 
CV risk based on rigorous analyses of the adjudicated CV events. 
Changes in Serum Markers of Lipids  
LDLc  
In study 747-301, mean baseline LDLc levels were >ULN (2.59 mmol/L or 100 mg/dL) for all treatment 
groups  (3.6  mmol/L  for  10  mg  OCA,  3.5  mmol/L  for  Titration  OCA,  and  3.6  mmol/L  for  placebo). 
Consistent with FXR-related effects and previously observed findings from early phase studies, at week 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 132/319 
 
  
 
 
 
 
2, a transient increase in LDLc was observed in the OCA groups, which returned to baseline levels by 
Month 3 and remained stable for the duration of treatment, with no difference from placebo between 
Month 3 and Month 12 (Figure 10). This small, transient increase in LDLc is unlikely to have an impact 
on long-term CV risk.  
A different pattern for changes in lipids was observed in Study 747-302. Mean baseline LDLc was slightly 
higher in study 747-302 (mean LDLc 4.0 mmol/L) compared to study 747-301 (mean LDLc 3.6 mmol/L). 
In  747-302,  a  transient  increase  in  LDLc  was  observed  in  the  placebo  group  in  the  first  month,  with 
decreases in LDLc over time in both OCA and placebo groups (Figure 11).  
While  this  pattern  of  lipid  changes  is  not  consistent  with  either  the  natural  history  of  PBC  or  known 
biologic effects of OCA, the frequent use of antipruritic medications, which also lower LDLc (specifically 
cholestyramine, bezafibrate and fenofibrate), may have contributed to the observed decreases in LDLc 
in this study. As shown in Table 20, a larger proportion of subjects (higher in the OCA group compared 
to the placebo group) used antipruritic medications (i.e., fibrates) during the study, which likely explains 
the pattern of LDLc decrease in both groups, and especially the greater LDLc lowering in OCA-treated 
subjects, who were more likely to use fibrates. Of note, more subjects in the placebo group reported use 
of a statin during the study compared to the OCA group.

HDLc  
As requested by CHMP, HDLc by visit and by treatment group from Study 747-301 is presented in Figure 
12. Mean baseline HDLc levels were 2.1 mmol/L in the 10 mg OCA group, 2.1 mmol/L in the Titration 
OCA group, and 1.8 mmol/L in the placebo group. The majority of subjects were above the LLN for HDLc. 
A small decrease in mean HDLc was observed from baseline in the OCA group, evident at Week 2, which 
attenuated over time through Month 12. At Month 12, the mean HDLc levels in the placebo and OCA 
titration groups were the same (1.8 mmol/L) and remained within normal range.  
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 135/319 
 
  
 
 
 
In Study 747-302, mean baseline HDLc was similar across treatment groups (1.9 mmol/dL in the OCA 
group and 1.8 mmol/dL in the placebo group) and similar to levels observed in Study 747-301 (Figure 
13). HDLc remained stable in the placebo group through approximately Month 36, after which increases 
were seen, but were associated with small sample size and differential dropout. In the OCA group, HDLc 
decreased from 1.9 mmol/dL to 1.7 mmol/dL at Month 1, with a gradual trend to baseline levels from 
Month 12 to Month 60 (between 1.8 mmol/dL and 2.0 mmol/dL).  
Of note, this degree of small decrease in HDLc has not been shown to impact CV risk (Güleç 2020). 
In  summary,  the  transient  increase  in  LDLc  and  the  small  decrease  in  HDLc,  which  attenuate  with 
continued treatment with OCA, are unlikely to negatively impact long-term CV risk.

Overall  
Overall, mean (SD) FRS was 9% (9) in the OCA group and 10% (11) in the placebo group at baseline. 
No  clear  trends  or  significant  differences  were  observed  in  FRS  between  treatment  groups  for  any 
baseline disease stage.  
Proposed SmPC  
In  the  Proposed  SmPC  population,  mean  (SD)  FRS  was  7%  (6)  in  the  OCA  group  and  9%  (9)  in  the 
placebo  group  at  baseline.  FRS  remained  <10%  at  Month  12  and  Month  42  in  the  OCA  and  placebo 
groups.

Ocaliva Post-marketing Data: CV Events  
OCA was granted accelerated approval under the trade name Ocaliva by the US FDA on 27 May 2016 
and received conditional approval by the European Commission on 12 Dec 2016 and by Health Canada 
on 24 May 2017. Ocaliva is now approved in 43 countries for the treatment of PBC in combination with 
UDCA in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA or as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate 
UDCA.  As of May 2023, the estimated cumulative global exposure from marketing experience is over 
35,000 patient-years.  
No increased risk of CV events has been observed in the post-marketing setting.  
Cumulatively, since marketing approval in 2016, 136 CV reports, which included 170 CV events, have 
been reported globally.  
The most frequently reported CV events were PTs of cerebrovascular accident (29), myocardial infarction 
(22), aphasia (15), dysarthria (7), cerebral haemorrhage (6), TIA (6), and thrombosis (6).  
Twelve CV cases with a fatal outcome were reported. Ten of these cases were assessed as not related 
or unlikely related to Ocaliva. The remaining 2 fatal cases were assessed as possibly related to Ocaliva; 
one report was from a patient with advanced PBC disease who would now be contraindicated per the 
current SmPC, and one fatal event of cerebral haemorrhage after a fall was confounded by concomitant 
use of an anticoagulant medication.  
In summary, the totality of data from randomized clinical trials, RWE, and post-marketing data does not 
show a clear signal for an increased CV risk associated with OCA. Based on these data, the MAH is not 
proposing any additional risk minimization measures beyond the scope of the proposed SmPC.  
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Hepatic Safety 
Evaluation of hepatic safety events was performed in Study 747-302, including analyses of Investigator-
reported hepatic TEAESIs (SMQ-based), and retrospective adjudication of a broad set of hepatic safety 
events as triggered by Investigator-reported TEAEs and pre-specified lab thresholds, by an independent 
adjudication committee (not previously reported to CHMP). Based on these data, compared to the overall 
population the incidence of hepatic TEAEs and other hepatic TEAEs noted by the CHMP in the OCA group 
were markedly lower with no meaningful difference between OCA and placebo treated subjects in the 
proposed  SmPC  indicated  population  (investigator-reported  hepatic  TEAESI:  27.2%  OCA  vs  42.6% 
placebo in the proposed SmPC and 47.6% OCA vs 58.4% placebo in the overall population; adjudicated 
hepatic safety events: 35.8% OCA vs 41.2% placebo in the proposed SmPC and 50.6% OCA vs 59.6% 
placebo  in  the  overall  population).  Not  unexpectedly,  the  incidence  of  positively  adjudicated  hepatic 
events  were  reduced  in  the  restricted  indication  (4.9%)  with  respect  to  the  overall  safety  population 
(10.1%), and similar rates of severe and exposure adjusted hepatic TEAEs are seen in OCA and placebo. 
A reduction in the overall incidence of hepatic events in subjects with an early stage PBC condition is not 
unexpected given that these events can be anticipated with the progression of the underlying disease. 
However, for a treatment aimed to modify disease progression, a reduction in the risk of hepatic TEAEs 
with respect to placebo arm would have been expected. Thus, although an increased hepatic toxicity of 
OCA treatment cannot be concluded based on these data, the roughly similar rates of hepatic events are 
not reassuring at all.  
As requested, other hepatic TEAEs noted by the CHMP (i.e., DILI, blood bilirubin increased, varices 
oesophageal, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy) were also analysed and presented. As 
expected, the incidences of most of these hepatic events, which are related to the severity and 
progression of the PBC condition, were reduced in the restricted early stage PBC population compared 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 138/319 
 
  
 
 
to the overall safety population (BR increased 4.9% vs 11.9%, varices oesophageal 4.9% vs 11.9%, 
portal hypertensive gastropathy 3.7% vs 8.3%), whilst the rate of DILI events remain unchanged 
(2.5% vs 2.4%). In the restricted population, the incidence of BR increased, varices oesophageal and 
ascites was lower in OCA vs placebo, which is reassuring. However, hepatic events of portal 
hypertensive gastropathy and DILI events were only reported for OCA treated patients in an otherwise 
mild, early stage PBC subpopulation, which is concerning.  
Information from postmarketing on hepatic events show that the frequency of hepatic AEs reported per 
100-patient years has dropped 30-fold between 2017 to 2023. However, this does not necessarily reflect 
a decrease in hepatic events linked to SmPC restrictions, as claimed by the MAH, but well reflect just a 
change in the main source of reporting data, where clinical trials decrease over time whilst spontaneous 
reporting is the main source in the late years. It is not surprising that the rate of spontaneous reporting 
decreases over time, particularly considering that most of these hepatic events would be expected during 
the progression of PBC. Adherence to current restrictions in the SmPC has not been measured, and thus, 
the effectiveness of current RMM remains undetermined.  
The MAH proposes a restriction in the indication for OCA to the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis 
(PBC)  without  cirrhosis  or  with  compensated  cirrhosis  who  do  not  have  clinical  evidence  of  portal 
hypertension  or  a  prior  decompensation  event,  in  combination  with  ursodeoxycholic  acid  (UDCA)  in 
adults with an inadequate response to UDCA or as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA in 
order to minimise these risks. Even if an apparent more acceptable hepatic safety profile is seen in this 
restricted population, data are limited (n=149) and results come from post-hoc analyses, thus no firm 
conclusions can be drawn. Even in this restricted population, rather similar rates of hepatic TEAEs and 
serious hepatic TEAEs are observed in OCA vs placebo treated subjects, which is not totally reassuring. 
Furthermore, some relevant hepatic events like portal hypertensive gastropathy and DILI events are still 
reported  during  OCA  treatment  in  an  otherwise  mild  and  early  stage  PBC  population.  This  is  further 
discussed under MO1, considering the totality of the safety findings. (See MO1).  
Information  in  the  SmPC  Section  4.4  should  be  duly  revised  to  properly  reflect  the  increased  risk  of 
hepatic TEAESI during OCA treatment, including a recommendation to interrupt treatment in patients 
progressing to more advanced PBC stages where OCA is contraindicated (OC). 
CV safety 
A higher rate of CV AEs was seen in OCA (8.9%) vs placebo (5.4%) treated patients, including higher 
rates of adjudicated MACE (3.0% OCA vs 1.8%placebo) and embolic and thrombotic events for CV AESIs 
(9.5%  OCA  vs  4.2%placebo)  in  the  overall  safety  population.  A  similar  trend  was  seen  in  the 
compensated subset of PBC patients.  
Apart  from  the  investigator  reported  TEAE  and  AESI  analyses,  an  independent  committee  of  experts 
adjudicated CV events based on capture of a broad set of triggers, including TEAEs, labs (e.g. troponin), 
ECGs, and review of hospitalizations, to provide a rigorous evaluation of CV events. Lipoproteins were 
measured at study visits. Based on these data, in comparison to the overall population, the incidence of 
cardiac disorder TEAE, CV TEAESI and serious CV TEAESI was reduced in the newly proposed restricted 
SmPC population: 7.4% OCA vs 5.9% placebo, 6.2% OCA vs 2.9 %placebo, 2.5% OCA vs 1.5% placebo, 
respectively. However, still numerically higher rates of these common events are seen in OCA treated 
subjects.  The  most  frequent  Cardiac  Disorder  PT  was  palpitations:  5  (3%)  patients  in the  OCA  group 
versus  2  (1.2%)  in  placebo  (palpitation  is  a  known  ADR  in  the  SmPC).  In  the  restricted  population, 
palpitation  remains  as  the  only  cardiac  disorder  reported  by  >1  OCA  patient  (3  patients,  3.7%  vs  0 
subjects  in  placebo).  The  incidence  of  TTP,  venous  thrombosis  and  cerebrovascular  accident  remains 
higher in the restricted PBC population (6.2% OCA vs 2.9% placebo).  
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 139/319 
 
  
 
 
A  retrospective  adjudication  of  CV  TEAE  reduces  the  incidence  of  MACE  events  in  the  overall  safety 
population (3.0 OCA vs 1.8%placebo), but a shift in trend is observed in the proposed SmPC population: 
(3  events) 1.2%OCA  and (1  event) 4.4%  placebo. This  is  reassuring,  but  due  to the low  numbers of 
events, results should be taken with caution.  
The previously observed findings in lipid parameters from early phase studies, which included a transient 
increase in LDLc at week 2 observed in the OCA groups, which returned to baseline levels by Month 3 
and remained stable for the duration of treatment, and transient HDL decreases, were not seen in the 
confirmatory trial. The MAH argues that decreases in LDLc over time in both OCA and placebo groups 
were likely due to frequent use of fibrates, whilst the early, small decrease in HDLc attenuated over the 
course of treatment with OCA and is unlikely to impact long-term CV risk.  
In the post-marketing setting, cumulatively, since marketing approval in 2016, 136 CV reports, which 
included 170 CV events, have been reported globally. The most frequently reported CV events were PTs 
of  cerebrovascular  accident  (29),  myocardial  infarction  (22),  aphasia  (15),  dysarthria  (7),  cerebral 
haemorrhage (6), TIA (6), and thrombosis (6). Twelve CV cases with a fatal outcome were reported, 10 
considered not related. 
Although firm conclusions cannot be drawn, the numerical imbalance observed in Study 747-301 with 
respect to CV events, including MACE and other thrombotic events, remains in the confirmatory trial. 
Restricting the population to those on early stage do not solve the concern, since still these events were 
reported  commonly  and  more  frequently  in  OCA  than  in  placebo  treated  subjects,  except  for  MACE 
events, but numbers are too limited to firmly conclude. Thus, at present, the increased risk of CV events 
cannot  be  ruled  out  neither  in  the  overall  nor  in  the  restricted  PBC  population.  Considering  the  early 
stage  of  PBC  condition,  the  high  incidence  of  CV  and  thrombotic  events  in  OCA  treated  patients  is 
concerning. The lack of information in Section 4.4 is not acceptable. A proposal to reflect the risk should 
be presented (OC). 
Based on the data presented, an increased risk of portal hypertension, DILI, thrombotic and CV events 
in OCA treated subjects may exist even in the restricted early PBC population. This is concerning and 
should  be  properly  reflected  in  the  SmPC.  Besides,  this  restricted  population  is  data  driven,  which 
hampers interpretation of the reported results.  
Issue not solved, but not further pursued within this procedure.  
SmPC changes to reflect the identified risks are deemed required.  
Other concerns 
Clinical aspects (Efficacy and Safety) 
Study 747-301 (LTSE) 
Question 3 
Patients randomized to placebo in Study 747-301 crossed over to OCA treatment and all 
patients were followed for up to an additional 5 years (747-301 LTSE). A more 
comprehensive presentation of the relevant efficacy and safety results (focusing on SAEs 
and AESIs) of this study should be provided. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 140/319 
 
  
 
 
Study 747-301 was the Phase 3, 12-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that was submitted in 
the original application to support the Conditional Marketing Authorisation (CMA) based on establishing 
a  reduction  in  serum  alkaline  phosphatase  (ALP).  The  study  enrolled  subjects  in  early-stage  primary 
biliary cholangitis (PBC) with ALP ≥1.67x upper limit of normal (ULN) or total bilirubin >ULN but < 2x 
ULN,  and  without  presence  of  clinical  complications  of  PBC  or  clinically  significant  hepatic 
decompensation. Following the 12-month double-blind, placebo-controlled period of Study 747-301, all 
subjects, including those who received placebo, were eligible to participate in an open-label LTSE and 
were followed for up to an additional 5 years (747-301 LTSE). The first subject was randomized to the 
double-blind  phase  in  March  2012  and  the  last  subject  completed  the  LTSE  Phase  of  the  study  in 
December 2018. Thus, at the time of the CMA approval in December 2016, all subjects were in the LTSE 
Phase.  
The Month 12 Visit from the double-blind phase served as the Day 1 Visit of the LTSE Phase as shown 
in Figure 14. 
Key study design aspects of 747-301 LTSE included:  
• 
Subject treatment allocation in the double-blind Phase was not made available until the entire 
study was unblinded. Accordingly, all subjects starting in the LTSE phase were initially started on the 5 
mg dose, i.e., subjects who received placebo started OCA therapy, those already on 5 mg continued on 
the same dose, while those who received 10 mg at the end of the double-blind phase were titrated down 
to 5 mg. Using this approach, blinding of the entire study was maintained and data on the effects of 
down titrating from 10 mg to 5 mg were also obtained.  
• 
All subjects continued at a 5 mg dose for a minimum of 3 months. Subsequent to the LTSE Month 
3 visit, OCA doses could be titrated (incrementally from 5 mg to 10 mg to 15 mg, up to 25 mg OCA at a 
frequency of no more than one up-titration every 3 months). However, effective with Protocol Version 5 
(21  Mar  2018),  the  protocol  was  amended  to  align  with  marketing  doses  (i.e.,  5  mg  or  10  mg  once 
daily). Any subject receiving a dose higher than 10 mg was down titrated to ≤10 mg daily.  
• 
Any of these subjects who had a clinically significant therapeutic response during the LTSE phase 
could have had their ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) withdrawn if determined clinically appropriate by the 
Investigator. Subjects who received investigational product as monotherapy in the double-blind phase 
were to receive OCA as a monotherapy in the LTSE phase.

747-301 LTSE – Disposition and Demographics  
LTSE – Disposition  
A total of 217 subjects were enrolled into the double-blind phase of the study; 198 subjects completed 
the double-blind phase, of which 193 subjects enrolled into the LTSE phase. The MAH decided to stop 
the LTSE phase early (before the last subject had completed) as it was determined that the LTSE had 
met its clinical objectives by demonstrating sustained efficacy of OCA after long-term treatment for up 
to  72  months  with  no  unexpected  safety  findings  with  longer-term  administration  of  OCA  in  this 
population.  
Subject disposition is summarized in Table 22 for the overall subject population.  
Overall,  there  was  good  retention  in  the  study.  A  total  of  158  (82%)  subjects  completed  4  years  of 
follow-up on study and 111 (60%) subjects completed the protocol as specified following administrative 
termination/closure  of  the  study  after  6  years.  The  largest  number  of  subjects  excluded  for  a  single 
cause were due to discontinuation of the study due to study closure by the MAH (83 [43%] subjects). 
Twenty (10%) subjects discontinued due to an adverse event (AE) (either pruritus or other AE), and 12 
(6%)  subjects  withdrew  consent.  Two  subjects in  the  LTSE  phase  (one  during  the  study  and  another 
after the study was closed) died; both deaths were considered by the Investigator as unrelated to OCA. 
An additional subject had died in the double-blind phase (considered as unlikely related to OCA by the 
Investigator and the MAH).

747-301 LTSE – Populations Analysed  
Except where noted, only subjects who enrolled in the LTSE phase were considered for analysis in this 
report. The Safety Population included 193 subjects who received at least 1 dose of OCA during the LTSE 
phase.  
747-301 LTSE – Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Key  demographic  and  baseline  characteristics  (baseline  at  the  time  of  enrolment  in  the  double-blind 
phase) of the 193 subjects enrolled in the LTSE are summarized by for Total OCA in Table 23.  
For the total population, the mean age was 55.4 years, with a range from 29 to 83 years. A total of 83% 
of  subjects  were  <65  years  of  age.  As  expected  with  PBC,  the  study  population  was  predominantly 
female (92%) and white (94%). The majority of the population was European (67%), followed by North 
American (29%), and Australian (4%).  
The mean body weight and body mass index were 69.70 kg and 26.05 kg/m2, respectively, with 82% 
of  subjects  being  <30  kg/m2.  The  majority  (93%)  of  the  population  was  on  UDCA  at  baseline.  The 
majority  of  subjects  enrolled  in  the  747-301  LTSE  had  features  of  mild  to  moderate  PBC.  Baseline 
bilirubin was >ULN in 8% of subjects, while baseline ALP, alanine transaminase (ALT), and aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) were >3x ULN in 27%, 24%, and 10% of subjects, respectively.

747-301 LTSE - Efficacy  
Composite Endpoint of Alkaline Phosphatase and Total Bilirubin  
The double-blind phase primary efficacy composite endpoint (the percentage of subjects with ALP <1.67x 
ULN and total bilirubin ≤ULN and an ALP decrease of ≥15% from baseline) was evaluated in the LTSE 
to  assess  the  long-term  efficacy  of  OCA  in  subjects  with  PBC,  including  durability  of  response.  The 
percentage of subjects achieving the primary efficacy composite endpoint in the LTSE phase is presented 
in Figure 15.  
For  subjects  previously  randomized  to  OCA  and  who  continued  treatment  with  OCA  in  the  LTSE,  the 
percentage of subjects achieving the primary composite endpoint at the end of the double-blind phase, 
i.e., Month 12 (51% for 5-10 mg OCA and 56% for 10 mg OCA), was sustained over the subsequent 
open-label period.  
A decrease in responders from Month 12 of the double-blind phase (LTSE baseline) to Month 3 LTSE was 
observed for subjects previously treated with 10 mg OCA, which was expected as the protocol required 
all subjects to initiate the LTSE at 5 mg OCA, including subjects who were randomized to 10 mg OCA. 
An improved response was subsequently observed at LTSE Month 6, consistent with protocol guidance 
that subjects were allowed to uptitrate after LTSE Month 3 and further reinforces 10 mg OCA provides 
incremental efficacy compared with 5 mg OCA.  
For subjects who received placebo during the double-blind phase and entered the LTSE, similar increases 
in responders from the double-blind baseline were observed at LTSE Month 3 that paralleled those of 
OCA during the double-blind placebo phase. Namely, a robust response was observed from LTSE baseline 
(9%) to LTSE Month 3 (34%), which was increased over the subsequent months of the LTSE treatment 
phase.  Importantly,  a  response  rate  of  approximately  50%  was  maintained  through  LTSE  Month  60, 
irrespective of dose or treatment group.

747-301 Double-Blind - Composite Endpoint of Alkaline Phosphatase and Total Bilirubin by Baseline ALP 
Tertile  
The  percentage  of  double-blind  subjects  achieving  the  primary  composite  endpoint  at  the  end  of  the 
double-blind phase was 47% in the OCA 10 mg group, 46% in the OCA titration group, and 10% in the 
placebo group. In the double-blind phase of the study only, the effect of OCA was also evaluated based 
on  baseline  ALP  tertiles  (<250.5  U/L  [lower],  ≥250.5  U/L  to  <339.6  U/L  [middle],  and  ≥339.6  U/L 
[higher]). As shown in Figure 16, a greater percentage of OCA-treated subjects achieved the primary 
composite endpoint compared with placebo-treated subjects across all 3 ALP tertiles (lower tertile: 18% 
placebo, 71% OCA titration, and 65% OCA 10 mg; middle tertile: 13% placebo, 50% OCA titration, and 
50% OCA 10 mg; upper tertile: 0% placebo, 17% OCA titration, 19% OCA 10 mg). As expected, the 
percentage of subjects achieving an endpoint was inversely proportional to the degree of severity (i.e., 
the highest percentage of subjects achieving the primary composite endpoint was in the lowest tertile).

747-301 LTSE – ALP Responder Analyses  
The original mean double-blind baseline ALP values were comparable across treatment groups, ranging 
from 307.47 (10 mg OCA) U/L to 328.42 U/L (placebo).  
Percentages of subjects achieving ALP reductions of ≥ 15% and ≥ 40% over time are summarized in 
Figure 17 for the safety population. By LTSE Month 12, about 80% of subjects had experienced a clinically 
significant 15% reduction in ALP. At LTSE Month 12, placebo subjects who started OCA in the LTSE saw 
an increased proportion of responders across both ALP thresholds. This was consistent with the responder 
rates observed with OCA treatment during the double-blind phase, which was sustained in the 5-10 mg 
OCA  and  10  mg  OCA  groups  throughout  the  LTSE.  By  LTSE  Month  60,  nearly  50%  of  OCA-treated 
subjects saw a ≥ 40% improvement in ALP. Notably, a decrease of ALP of > 40% in patients with PBC 
has been associated with survival rates comparable to healthy matched control populations (Parés 2006).

747-301 LTSE – ALP and Bilirubin Time Course  
ALP and bilirubin values over time and change from baseline are summarized in Figure 18.  
The clinically meaningful and statistically significant reductions from baseline in ALP observed in OCA-
treated  subjects  through  the  initial  12-month,  double-blind  phase  were  sustained  with  continued 
treatment in the LTSE. Notably, absolute means approached 1.67× ULN, which has been correlated with 
improved transplant-free survival (Lammers 2014) and remained generally stable through LTSE Month 
60.  For  subjects  who  received  placebo  during  the  double-blind  phase  and  entered  the  LTSE,  similar 
statistically significant reductions in ALP from the double-blind baseline were observed as early as LTSE 
EMA/528620/2023

Month 3 that paralleled those of OCA during the double-blind placebo phase, with reductions sustained 
through end of study.  
The double-blind baseline mean total bilirubin values were comparable across treatment groups, ranging 
from  10.434  μmol/L  (5-10  mg  OCA)  to  11.807  μmol/L  (placebo).  During  the  double-blind  treatment 
phase, total bilirubin levels tended to increase from baseline in placebo subjects. Following initiation of 
OCA in the LTSE, mean total bilirubin concentrations in placebo subjects declined and reached levels that 
were comparable to or below baseline in the double-blind phase. These changes were not statistically 
significant.  For  subjects  treated  with  OCA  during  the  double-blind  period,  continued  OCA  treatment 
maintained total bilirubin concentrations at or below baseline throughout the LTSE. Maintaining bilirubin 
levels at or below ULN has been shown to improve liver-related outcomes over time (Murillo-Perez 2020). 
747-301 LTSE – Other Efficacy Clinical Laboratory Endpoints  
GGT, ALT, and AST  
EMA/528620/2023

Gamma  glutamyl  transferase  (GGT),  ALT,  and  AST  values  over  time  and  change  from  baseline  are 
summarized in Figure 19. The clinically meaningful and statistically significant reductions from baseline 
in GGT, ALT, and AST observed in OCA-treated subjects through the initial 12-month, double-blind phase 
were  sustained  with  continued  treatment  in  the  LTSE  through  Month  60.  For  subjects  who  received 
placebo during the double-blind period and entered the LTSE, similar statistically significant reductions 
from the double-blind baseline were observed for all 3 parameters at LTSE Month 3 that paralleled those 
of  OCA  during  the  double-blind  placebo  period.  In  this  group,  improvements  were  also  maintained 
through Month 60. 
747-301 LTSE – Markers of Farnesoid X Receptor Activation  
Statistically significant increases from baseline in fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF-19) observed in OCA-
treated  subjects  through  the  initial  12-month,  double-blind  phase  were  sustained  with  continued 
treatment  in  the  LTSE  through  Month  48  (Figure  20).  For  subjects  who  received  placebo  during  the 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 151/319 
 
  
 
 
 
double-blind period and entered the LTSE, similar statistically significant increases from the double-blind 
baseline were observed at LTSE Month 12 that paralleled those of OCA during the double-blind placebo 
period.  These  results  are  consistent  with  OCA-mediated  farnesoid  X  receptor  activation  resulting  in 
greater FGF-19 concentration which were sustained and durable through the duration of treatment. 
747-301 LTSE - Markers Inflammation  
Statistically significant reductions from baseline in markers of inflammation cytokeratin 18 (CK-18), C-
reactive protein (CRP), and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) were observed in OCA-treated subjects 
through the initial 12-month, double-blind phase and were sustained with continued treatment in the 
LTSE  (Figure  21).  For  subjects  who  received  placebo  during  the  double-blind  period  and  entered  the 
LTSE, similar statistically significant reductions from the double-blind baseline were observed for TNF-α 
at LTSE Month 12 that paralleled those of OCA during the double-blind period. CK-18 and CRP were also 
decreased from double-blind baseline in placebo subjects at LTSE Month 12 and beyond; however, these 
values did not reach statistical significance.

747-301 LTSE – Liver Stiffness as Assessed by Transient Elastography (TE)  
Across treatment groups, mean double-blind baseline hepatic stiffness values ranged from 9.74 kPa (5-
10 mg OCA) to 12.50 kPa (placebo), and median double-blind baseline hepatic stiffness values were 6.3 
kPa (5-10 mg OCA) to 9.00 kPa (placebo) (747-301 LTSE CSR, Table 14.2.9). These values are consistent 
with F2-F3 fibrosis, based on the following thresholds: ≥F1 7.1 kPa; ≥F2 8.8 kPa; ≥F3 10.7 kPa; ≥F4 
16.9  kPa  (Corpechot  2012).  As  was  the  case  in  the  double-blind  phase  of  the  study,  there  was  no 
statistically  significant  progression  of  hepatic  stiffness  observed  during  the  LTSE  as  measured  by  TE 
(Figure  22).  Stabilization  or  improvement  in  liver  stiffness  over  time  by  TE  have  been  shown  to  be 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 153/319 
 
  
 
 
 
associated with significant reductions in adverse hepatic outcomes (Corpechot 2022) 
747-301 LTSE – Liver Biopsy and Histology  
A protocol-defined biopsy substudy (n=17) was performed in subjects assessing baseline biopsies (up 
to 1 year before the start of the double-blind phase) and after 3 years of OCA treatment (LTSE Month 
24 for OCA randomized subjects and LTSE Month 36 for placebo randomized subjects).  
Fibrosis shifts from double-blind baseline by fibrosis subgroup are summarized in Table 24.  
Three  years  of  OCA  treatment  was  generally  associated  with  an  improvement  or  no  worsening  of 
histologic fibrosis in subjects with PBC. Specifically, 4 subjects experienced a worsening of fibrosis and 
7  subjects  experienced  an  improvement  in  fibrosis,  including  2  subjects  with  incomplete  cirrhosis 
improving to septal fibrosis. 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 154/319 
 
  
 
 
 
A post hoc reanalysis of the biopsy substudy was conducted with a consensus read from 2 pathologists 
using the most modern histologic scoring system for PBC (Nakanuma Histologic Staging) and automated 
second harmonic generation imaging for collagen morphometry.  
The  results  of  the  post  hoc  reanalysis  (Bowlus  2019)  were  generally  consistent  with  per-protocol 
assessment, with the majority of subjects experiencing an improvement or no worsening in histologic 
fibrosis (71%). Additionally, it was found that the majority of subjects had or experienced or exhibited 
improvements  or  no  worsening  in  ductopenia  (82%),  ductular  reaction  (82%),  interface  hepatitis 
(100%), and lobular hepatitis (94%), all of which are key histologic features of PBC. Finally, automated 
collagen  morphometry  assessments  revealed  that  after  3  years  of  OCA  treatment,  subjects  had 
reductions in collagen area ration, collagen fiber density, and collagen reticulation index. Overall, the 
results of the post hoc reanalysis were indicative that long-term OCA treatment in patients with PBC is 
associated with improvement or stabilization across a spectrum of histologic features of PBC.

747-301 LTSE – Efficacy Conclusions  
Study 747-301 enrolled subjects with ALP ≥1.67x ULN or total bilirubin >ULN but <2x ULN, and without 
presence of clinical complications of PBC or clinically significant hepatic decompensation. This population 
is representative of what is expected in actual clinical target practice and consistent with the current and 
proposed SmPC.  
The efficacy associated with continued treatment with OCA was durable and consistent with the effects 
observed in the double-blind phase. For subjects originally randomized to OCA, continued treatment was 
associated  with  sustained  improvements  in  liver  biochemistry.  For  subjects  originally  randomized  to 
placebo,  there  were  clinically  significant  improvements  in  liver  biochemistry  following  the  initiation  of 
OCA nearly identical to the changes observed in subjects randomized to OCA in the double-blind phase. 
Specifically,  long-term  treatment  with  OCA,  up  to  6  years  in  subjects  with  PBC  resulted  in  clinically 
meaningful improvements as assessed by the primary efficacy endpoint—the composite ALP and total 
bilirubin  endpoint  that  supported  initial  approval  of  OCA  for  the  treatment  of  PBC.  In  addition, 
improvements in markers of cholestasis, inflammation, and hepatocellular injury were observed along 
with  improvement  or  no  worsening  of  histologic  fibrosis.  Improvements  in  markers  of  fibrosis  and 
apoptosis observed during the double-blind phase were all maintained with long-term treatment.  
• 
Response to the composite endpoint, which has been accepted as an endpoint reasonably likely 
to predict clinical benefit in patients with PBC, was maintained with long-term OCA treatment up to 6 
years.  
• 
The  mean  improvements  in  ALP  were  sustained  with  long-term  treatment.  Notably,  absolute 
mean values of ALP approached 1.67× ULN, which has been correlated with improved transplant-free 
survival (Lammers 2014). 
• 
By LTSE Month 60, nearly 50% of OCA-treated subjects saw a ≥ 40% improvement in ALP, which 
has  been  associated  with  survival  rates  comparable  with  healthy-matched  control  populations  (Parés 
2006).  
• 
OCA treatment was associated with long-term maintenance of total bilirubin concentrations at 
or  below  baseline.  These  longer-term  bilirubin  data  provide  clinically  relevant  context  of  disease 
progression given that total bilirubin does not deteriorate until later stage of disease. These results are 
significant  as  maintenance  of  bilirubin  levels  at  or  below  ULN  has  been  shown  to  be  associated  with 
improved liver related outcomes over time (Murillo-Perez 2020).  
• 
The clinically meaningful and statistically significant reductions from baseline in GGT, ALT, and 
AST observed in OCA-treated subjects through the initial 12-month, double-blind phase were sustained 
with continued treatment in the LTSE.  
• 
Other markers of hepatocellular injury and inflammation, including CK-18, CRP, and TNF-α, were 
reduced following initiation of OCA and sustained with continued treatment during the LTSE.  
• 
There was no significant progression of hepatic stiffness observed during the LTSE as measured 
by  TE.  Worsening  of  liver  stiffness  by  TE  has  been  shown  to  be  associated  with  adverse  long-term 
outcomes in PBC.  
• 
A biopsy substudy (n=17) was performed in subjects who had liver biopsies at baseline and after 
3  years  of  OCA  treatment.  OCA  treatment  was  generally  associated  with  an  improvement  or  no 
worsening  of  histologic  fibrosis  in  subjects  with  PBC.  Results  of  the  post  hoc reanalysis  of  the  biopsy 
substudy  were  indicative  that  long-term  OCA  treatment  in  patients  with  PBC  is  associated  with 
improvement or stabilization across a spectrum of histologic features of PBC.

747-301 LTSE – Safety  
The Safety Population included all subjects who received at least one dose of OCA during the LTSE phase. 
Treatment assignment was based on the treatment actually received. The Safety Population (N=193) 
was used for the analysis of all safety data.  In this section, all safety parameters are presented by Total 
OCA.  
LTSE – Exposure: A total of 193 subjects received at least 1 dose of OCA during the LTSE (Table 25). 
The median number of days on OCA was 1924.0 days (5.3 years) from initiation of OCA regardless of if 
it was in the double-blind or LTSE phase. The median weighted average daily OCA dose for Total OCA 
was 8.3 mg (SD 3.42). Forty-two (22%) subjects received OCA >10 mg daily at some point during the 
study (Subjects were allowed to be titrated up to 25 mg OCA prior to Protocol Version 5 (21 Mar 2018) 
to align with marketing doses). 
LTSE – Brief Summary of Adverse Events  
An overall summary of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) during the LTSE phase is provided 
in Table 26. Overall, 189 (98%) subjects had at least 1 TEAE. A total of 105 (54%) subjects had a severe 
TEAE (incidence largely driven by pruritus), 64 (33%) subjects had a moderate TEAE, 20 (10%) subjects 
had a mild TEAE, and 150 (78%) subjects had a treatment-related TEAE. Two (1%) subjects had a TEAE 
that led to death; 61 (32%) subjects had at least 1 serious TEAE; and 25 (13%) subjects had a TEAE 
that led to discontinuation.

747-301 LTSE – Frequent Adverse Events  
TEAEs that occurred in ≥ 5% of subjects in the total group are summarized in Table 27. The AE profile 
in the LTSE phase was consistent with that reported in the double-blind phase as  well as in previous 
studies with OCA; no new findings were noted.  
The most common TEAE by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred term was 
pruritus (132 [68%] subjects). Most TEAEs were considered resolved at the end of the LTSE.

747-301 Deaths  
Three  subjects  died  across  both  phases  of  the  study,  2  in  the  LTSE  phase  and  1  in  the  double-blind 
phase.  
Two  subjects  died  during  the  LTSE,  and  both  deaths  were  considered  not  related  to  OCA  by  the 
Investigator and the MAH.  
--Subject 1 (Preferred Term: Sepsis)  
Cause of Death: Bacterial endocarditis with multiorgan failure after cardiac surgery  
A male subject was admitted to the hospital with infective endocarditis related to a bioprosthetic aortic 
valve (approximately 6 months after the start of the LTSE phase of the study). The subject’s hospital 
course was dominated by complications of bacterial endocarditis (perivalvular abscess, splenic infarction, 
bacterial pneumonitis). The subject underwent aortic valve replacement with another bioprosthesis and 
total splenectomy due to splenic infarction. The subject died approximately 3 weeks after cardiac surgery 
due to multi-organ failure in the setting of ongoing sepsis (infective endocarditis). The event (Preferred 
Term: Sepsis) was considered by the Investigator and MAH as not related to OCA.  
--Subject 2 (Preferred Term: Jaundice)  
Cause of Death: Alcoholic hepatitis with multiorgan failure  
A female subject was noted to have a sudden severe spike in total bilirubin on end-of-treatment blood 
tests. Clinically, she presented with onset of severe jaundice 58 months after the start of the LTSE phase 
of the study. A week later she was admitted to the hospital for increasing jaundice in the setting of an 
increased alcohol intake over the preceding months. The subject had signs of encephalopathy, and over 
the  course  of  the  hospitalization,  had  a  gradual  deterioration  with  increasing  jaundice,  hepatorenal 
syndrome, and confirmed acute alcoholic hepatitis. The subject had completed the study through study 
closure  and  died  about  3  weeks  after  OCA  and  study  discontinuation  due  to  alcoholic  hepatitis  with 
multiorgan  failure  (hepatic,  renal,  encephalopathy)  with  a  background  of  primary  biliary  cholangitis 
without evidence of advanced cirrhotic liver disease prior to the event of alcoholic hepatitis. The event 
(Preferred Term: Jaundice) was considered by the Investigator and MAH as not related to OCA.  
An  additional  subject  died  in  the  double-blind  phase  and  the  fatal  event  was  considered  as  unlikely 
related to OCA by the Investigator and the MAH.  
--Subject 3 (Preferred Term: Cardiac failure)  
Cause of Death: Recurrent heart failure in subject with severe, longstanding cardiovascular disease  
Amale subject experienced a serious adverse event of cardiac failure and was hospitalized approximately 
7  months  after  the  start  of  the  double-blind  phase  of  the  study.  The  subject  had  a  long  history  of 
cardiovascular disease  with  hypertension,  multiple myocardial  infarctions,  recurrent  episodes  of  heart 
failure, atrial fibrillation, and chronic renal impairment prior to enrolment into the study (since 1993). 
The event of worsening heart failure (cardiac failure) was considered resolved at the time of hospital 
discharge.  Approximately  5  weeks  later,  the  subject  had  a  second  event  of  cardiac  failure  and  was 
hospitalized again. The subject was discharged home and readmitted to the hospital approximately 1 
month  later  for  worsening  symptoms  of  heart  failure  and  investigational  product  dosing  was 
discontinued.  During  this  admission  the  subject  was  placed  on  an  “End  of  life  care  pathway”  and  his 
symptoms were palliated. He died and the primary cause of death was noted as congestive cardiac failure 
and  ischaemic  heart  disease,  prior  myocardial  infarction.  Secondary  causes  of  death  were  listed  as 
chronic  kidney  disease  and  PBC.  The  event  (Preferred  Term:  Cardiac  Failure)  was  considered  by  the 
Investigator and MAH as unlikely related to investigational product.  
EMA/528620/2023

The above described in the LTSE and double-blind phases deaths were unexpected and unrelated to the 
subjects’  underlying  liver  disease.  All  subjects  had  stable  synthetic  liver  function  and  no  evidence  of 
decompensation at baseline.  
LTSE – Other Serious Adverse Events  
Serious TEAEs that occurred in >1 subject in the total group are summarized by Total OCA in Table 28. 
Overall, 61 (32%) subjects had a serious TEAE.  
The only serious TEAEs reported in more than 1 subject were osteoarthritis (in 6 subjects), ooesophageal 
varices  haemorrhage  (in  4  subjects),  radius  fracture  and  pneumonia  (in  3  subjects  each),  and 
pancreatitis,  procedural  pain,  atrial  fibrillation,  and  anaemia  (in  2  subjects  each).  Two  of  the  serious 
TEAEs (atrial fibrillation and cardiac failure congestive) were considered by the Investigator to be possibly 
related to OCA; all other serious TEAEs were considered not related or unlikely related.  
All serious TEAEs resolved with or without sequelae except for the 2 deaths in the LTSE phase described 
in Section 2.1.3.3 and the serious TEAEs of chronic myeloid leukaemia and breast cancer, which were 
ongoing at the end of the study. 
LTSE – Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events that Led to Study Discontinuation  
TEAEs that led to study discontinuation and occurred in >1 subject in the total group are summarized 
by Total OCA in Table 29. Overall, 26 (13%) subjects had a TEAE that led to discontinuation. The only 
TEAEs  that  led to  discontinuation  reported in  more than  1  subject  were  pruritus  (in 14  subjects)  and 
ooesophageal varices haemorrhage and fatigue (in 2 subjects each).  
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 162/319 
 
  
 
 
 
Several of the TEAEs that led to discontinuation were considered by the Investigator to be possibly or 
probably related to OCA, while 5 TEAEs (in 3 subjects) were considered definitely related: pruritis and 
neurodermatitis  in  one  subject,  pruritus  in  a  second  and  pruritus  and  quality  of  life  decreased  in  the 
third. 
About half of TEAEs that led to discontinuation resolved with or without sequelae after discontinuation 
of  OCA.  All  the  other  TEAEs  remained  ongoing  (or  led  to  death  in  2  LTSE  subjects  [deemed  by  the 
Investigator as not related to OCA]) at the time of study discontinuation. 
Pruritus Events  
Overall, 151 (78%) subjects had an event. No subject had a serious TEAE of pruritus. Pruritus TEAEs 
that led to discontinuation were reported in 14 subjects. Of these, 7 subjects had TEAEs that were severe 
(1 subject was listed as "Drug Interrupted," but end of study indicated that the subject was withdrawn 
from  the  study  due  to  a  TEAE,  so  written  as  though  investigational  product  was  withdrawn),  5  were 
moderate, and 2 were mild. 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 163/319 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Throughout treatment, more pruritus days were mild than moderate or severe. This aligns with the mean 
(SD) visual analogue scale values remaining in the mild range through the duration of treatment from 
OCA baseline. Pruritus frequency and severity remained steady after approximately 3 months of OCA 
treatment.  
Hepatic-Related Events  
-Assessment of SMQ of Hepatic Disorders  
An assessment of overall treatment-emergent hepatic disorders was conducted using the Standardised 
MedDRA  Query  (SMQ)  of  Hepatic  Disorders,  excluding  the  following  sub-SMQs:  Congenital,  familial, 
neonatal, and genetic disorders of the liver; Liver infections; and Pregnancy-related hepatic disorders.  
Hepatic-related TEAEs during the LTSE phase are summarized in Table 31.  
Overall,  47  (24%)  subjects  (Total  OCA)  had  a  hepatic-related  event.  The  most  common  events  were 
ooesophageal varices in 11 (6%), ascites in 10 (5%), and hepatic cirrhosis in 7 (4%) subjects which 
generally reflected disease progression.

Serious Hepatic-Related Events  
Eight (4.1%) subjects had a serious hepatic-related TEAE during the LTSE phase. Oesophageal varices 
haemorrhage  (in  4  subjects)  and  varices  oesophageal  (in  2  subjects)  were  the  only  serious  hepatic-
related events that occurred in more than 1 subject. Other serious hepatic-related TEAEs were reported 
in a single subject each: hepatic failure, hepatic neoplasm malignant, ascites, and jaundice. In general, 
the types of serious hepatic-related TEAEs appeared to be consistent with progression of disease. All of 
the serious hepatic-related TEAEs were considered by the Investigator to be unlikely or not related to 
OCA. The majority of these subjects had prior medical history for which they would be contraindicated 
these per the new proposed SmPC. Of the below subjects, 3 received a liver transplant within 30 days 
of end of study.  
--Subject 1 (Preferred Term: Hepatic failure)  
Type of Event: Oesophageal variceal haemorrhage, hepatic failure, liver transplantation  
Time of Event: Approximately 2 months after the start of the LTSE phase  
A  male  subject  with  evidence  of  portal  hypertension  (low  platelets)  and  synthetic  liver  function 
impairment (elevated international normalized ratio) at baseline. At inclusion into LTSE phase there was 
clear evidence of advanced chronic liver disease with portal hypertension and decreased liver function. 
Approximately 6 months after the start of the LTSE phase, the subject underwent evaluation for a liver 
transplant due to a Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score of 15. He experienced jaundice with 
a  bilirubin  >3  mg/dL  and  portal  hypertension  manifested  by  ascites,  lower  extremity  oedema, 
oesophageal  varices,  and  hypersplenism.  The  subject  began  requiring  regular  paracentesis  to  treat 
recurrent  ascites.  The  subject  underwent  variceal  band  ligation  3  times  within  the  first  year  of 
participating in the LTSE. Approximately 1 year after the start of the LTSE phase of the study, the subject 
was admitted to the hospital with hematemesis, haematochezia, asthenia, and light-CHMP headedness. 
The subject underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy with placement of 5 bands resulting in abatement 
of bleeding. The subject also underwent an intrahepatic portosystemic shunt procedure which achieved 
a  reduction  in  the  portosystemic  gradient.  The  subject’s  MELD  score  was  20,  and  he  eventually  was 
transferred  to  the  Transplant  Surgical  Service  unit  for  liver  transplant  due  to  chronic  hepatic  failure. 
Approximately 2 weeks into hospitalization, the subject underwent orthotopic liver transplantation, and 
choledochocholedocostomy without complication. The subject had withdrawn OCA upon admission to the 
hospital and was subsequently discontinued from the study after undergoing liver transplant.  
--Subject 2 (Preferred Term: Variceal bleed)  
Type of Event: Oesophageal variceal haemorrhage  
Time of Event: Approximately 4.5 years after the start of the LTSE phase  
A female subject with evidence of advanced chronic liver disease with portal hypertension (splenomegaly 
and  thrombocytopenia)  at  baseline  was  hospitalized  with  an  oesophageal  variceal  bleed  after 
experiencing haematochezia for a few days. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed Grade 2 
oesophageal varices, hiatal hernia, and portal hypertensive gastropathy. The subject underwent variceal 
banding and additionally received 1 unit of blood, as well as tranexamic acid, terlipressin, and carvedilol. 
The  subject  was  discharged  approximately  2  weeks  later  and  was  referred  for  liver  transplant 
assessment.  In  response  to  the  event,  OCA  was  withdrawn  and  the  subject  was  subsequently 
discontinued from study follow-up 2 months later.  
--Subject 3 (Preferred Term: Oesophageal variceal haemorrhage)  
Type of Event: Oesophageal variceal haemorrhage  
Time of Event: Approximately 2 years and 3 months after the start of the LTSE phase  
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 166/319 
 
  
 
 
A male subject with a relevant medical history of splenomegaly with decreased platelets and stage three 
distortion  of  the  hepatic  architecture  with  numerous  fibrous  septa  at  baseline  was  admitted  to  the 
hospital  due  to  oesophageal  variceal  bleeding.  The  subject  presented  to  the  emergency  room  with 
complaints of weakness, dizziness, general malaise, and a 3-day history of black stool. He experienced 
hematemesis while in the waiting room. During hospitalization, the subject was treated with 2 units of 
blood, sodium chloride, pantoprazole, octreotide, and ceftriaxone. An EGD showed circumferential large 
varices  that  were  not  bleeding  but  were  banded  and  evidence  of  moderate  portal  hypertensive 
gastropathy.  The  subject underwent  paracentesis  due  to  ascites  and  was  discharged  approximately  a 
week after being admitted. OCA was interrupted during hospitalization. Treatment was restarted the day 
after event resolution and the subject continued investigational product for approximately 2 years and 
8 months until study completion.  
--Subject 4 (Preferred Term: Hepatocellular carcinoma)  
Type of Event: Hepatic neoplasm malignant, hepatic neoplasm malignant recurrent  
Time of Event: Approximately 2 years and 11 months after the start of the LTSE phase  
A  female  subject  was  diagnosed  with  hepatocellular  carcinoma  in  liver  segment  7  after  a  magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) revealed lesions suspicious for hepatocellular carcinoma. The subject showed 
evidence of cirrhosis with portal hypertension at inclusion into the LTSE phase. She was hospitalized and 
underwent laparoscopic biopsy and radiofrequency ablation of the lesion in segment 7. Biopsy showed a 
CK-19 negative hepatocellular carcinoma, confirmed with carcinoembryonic antigen antibody staining. 
The  subject  was  discharged  the  next  day.  Approximately  8  months  later,  an  MRI  showed  recurrent 
hepatocellular  carcinoma  in  segment  7.  The  subject  was  hospitalized  for  an  elective  transarterial 
chemoembolization. A few months later, approximately 3 years and 8 months after the start of the LTSE 
phase, the subject underwent liver transplantation. The subject was subsequently discontinued from the 
study.  
--Subject 5 (Preferred Term: Oesophageal variceal haemorrhage)  
Type of Event: Oesophageal variceal haemorrhage  
Time of Event Approximately 11 months after the start of the LTSE phase  
A female subject with relevant past medical history of oesophageal varices and thrombocytopenia. She 
presented to the hospital after several episodes of haematemesis; was hypotensive and was admitted 
for further evaluation. Treatment included intravenous octreotide and pantoprazole. An upper endoscopy 
showed  Grade  3  varices  in  the  lower  third  of  the  oesophagus  and  severe  portal  gastropathy.  Varices 
were banded due to high risk of bleeding. The subject was discharged 3 days later in stable condition. 
No  action  was  taken  with  OCA  in  response  to  the  event.  The  subject  continued  in  the  study  on 
investigational product for approximately 2 years  and 3 months when she was discontinued from the 
study due to Investigator decision.  
--Subject 6 (Preferred Term: Ascites)  
Type of Event: Ascites  
Time of Event: Approximately 2 years after the start of the LTSE phase  
A female subject who had previously, in the double-blind phase, been hospitalized due to life-threatening 
upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage due to Grade 3 oesophageal varices. The subject was hospitalized 
due to ascites. The subject was admitted to a local hospital with complaints of a bloated abdomen, fever, 
ascites,  and  abdominal  pain  in  the  right  upper  quadrant.  She  was  treated  with  spironolactone  and 
furosemide. Several days later, the subject underwent paracentesis; spontaneous  bacterial peritonitis 
was  ruled  out  when  ascites  analysis  revealed  low  polymorphonuclear  granulocytes.  The  subject  was 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 167/319 
 
  
 
 
discharged approximately a week after admission with only residual ascites remaining. No action was 
taken with OCA in response to the event. However, the subject experienced an episode of severe itching 
20  days  after  discharge  and  the  investigational  product  was  subsequently  ceased.  She  was  listed  for 
transplant 2 months later and underwent orthotopic liver transplantation the following month.  
--Subject 7 (Preferred Term: Jaundice)  
Type of Event Jaundice  
See narrative in Section 2.1.3.3.1  
--Subject 8 (Preferred Term: Varices oesophageal)  
Type of Event: Oesophageal variceal haemorrhage  
Time of Event: Approximately 11 months after the start of the LTSE phase  
A female subject with relevant medical history of hepatosplenomegaly and thrombocytopenia at baseline 
was hospitalized due to hematemesis. An EGD showed 3 varices with no signs of recent bleeding. The 
next  day,  she  was  transferred  to  another  hospital  where  she  was  admitted  for  oesophageal  varices 
haemorrhage. She was treated with 1 unit of packed red blood cells. An EGD was performed for variceal 
ligation,  but  the  subject  did  not  tolerate  the  procedure  and  experienced  vomiting  with  consequent 
bleeding  varices.  The  varices  were  ligated  and  the  subject  was  discharged  the  following  day  with 
diagnoses of digestive haemorrhage due to oesophageal varices, ligature of the varices, and advanced 
PBC.  No  action  was  taken  with  OCA  in  response  to the  event.  The  subject  continued  in  the  study  on 
investigational product for approximately 4 years and 2 months until study completion.  
Analysis of Hepatic Clinical Outcome Events  
In  addition to  the  assessment of  the  SMQ  of  Hepatic  Disorders,  the  incidence  and  exposure-adjusted 
incidence rates of hepatic-related adverse events reflective of clinical outcomes (hepatic failure, hepatic 
cirrhosis,  liver  transplant and  model  for  end-stage  liver  disease  (MELD)  ≥15)  were  also  examined  by 
baseline cirrhosis status.  
One subject out of 193 experienced hepatic failure. This male subject assigned to the OCA titration group 
during the double-blind phase with cirrhosis at baseline was up-titrated to 10 mg and then 15 mg once 
daily  during  the  LTSE  phase  prior  to  developing  hepatic  failure  (Day  743).  It  was  determined  by  the 
Investigator that the event was not related to OCA treatment.  
Less than 10% of subjects had an increase in MELD ≥15 and there was no observed difference in EAIR.  
Liver Transplantation  
Three subjects underwent orthotopic liver transplantation during the LTSE phase of 747-301. Two of the 
subjects received placebo in the double-blind phase. At LTSE baseline all 3 subjects had progressed to 
cirrhosis  with  evidence  of  portal  hypertension  (exclusion  per  the  proposed  Summary  of  Product 
Characteristics [SmPC]). One subject was transplanted for recurrent multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma 
and intact synthetic liver function, the other 2 subjects had a gradual decline in synthetic liver function 
with recurrent episodes of decompensation event.  
All  3  subjects  showed  evidence  of  advanced  chronic  liver  disease  at  double-blind  baseline:  one  each 
with: 1) decompensation and synthetic liver function impairment, 2) evidence of portal hypertension, 
and  3)  evidence  of  portal  hypertension  and  hepatocellular  carcinoma.  Per  the  proposed  SmPC  these 
subjects would be excluded from treatment.  
LTSE – Dyslipidaemia Events  
Dyslipidaemia TEAEs during the LTSE phase are summarized in Table 32. Overall, 19 (10%) subjects 
had an event. No subject had a serious TEAE related to dyslipidaemia.

747-301 LTSE – Cardiovascular Disorder Events  
Cardiovascular disorder TEAEs during the LTSE phase are summarized in Table 33. Overall, 40 (21%) 
subjects experienced at least 1 cardiovascular disorder event.

Eight  (4%)  subjects  had  a  serious  cardiovascular  disorder  TEAE  during  the  LTSE  phase,  with  atrial 
fibrillation  (in  2  subjects)  being  the  only  event  reported  in  more  than  1  subject.  Other  serious 
cardiovascular  disorder  TEAEs  were  reported  in  a  single  subject  each:  myocardial  infarction, 
cardiomyopathy,  cardiac  failure  congestive,  ischemic  stroke,  transient  ischemic  attack,  and  splenic 
infarction; a single subject experienced single events of aortic valve stenosis, ventricular fibrillation, and 
cardiac failure. Two subjects had a serious cardiovascular disorder TEAE considered by the Investigator 
to  be  possibly  related  to OCA  (but  unlikely  related by  the  MAH):  cardiac  failure  congestive  and  atrial 
fibrillation in 1 subject each).  
--Subject ID: 1 (Preferred Terms: Atrial fibrillation, Myocardial infarction)  
Type of Event: Atrial fibrillation  
Time of Event: Approximately 2 years and 1 month after the start of the LTSE phase  
A female subject with relevant medical history of hypertension and cardiac conduction abnormalities (AV 
block  with  bradycardia)  at  baseline  was  hospitalized  for  atrial  fibrillation.  She  was  admitted  for 
electrophysiology study with ablation. The subject was successfully converted into sinus rhythm during 
the  ablation  procedure  without  complication.  Additional  treatment  included  dopamine,  protamine, 
heparin, cefazolin, and mepivacaine. The subject was discharged in stable condition the next day. No 
action was taken with OCA in response to the event. The event was assessed as unlikely related to OCA 
by the Investigator and MAH. The subject continued in the study. 
Type of Event: Myocardial infarction  
Time of Event: Approximately 2 years and 5 months after the start of the LTSE phase  
The  subject  presented  to  the  hospital  with  chest  pain  and  was  hospitalized  for  possible  myocardial 
infarction. Serum CK and troponin were elevated and a coronary angiogram did not show evidence of 
obstructive atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. The subject was also found to be in atrial flutter and 
had  an  episode  of  hypotension.  Treatment  included  diltiazem,  rivaroxaban,  sublingual  nitroglycerin, 
promethazine,  paracetamol,  alprazolam,  temazepam,  ondansetron,  tramadol,  morphine,  ranitidine, 
atropine, lidocaine, heparin, and fentanyl. The subject was discharged the next day. No action was taken 
with OCA in response to the event. The event was assessed as unlikely related to OCA by the Investigator 
and MAH. The subject continued in the study.  
--Subject 2 (Preferred Term: Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy)  
Type of Event Cardiomyopathy  
Time of Event: Approximately 3 years and 11 months after the start of the LTSE phase  
A female subject with relevant medical history of hypertension and deep vein thrombosis at baseline was 
hospitalized  with  non-ischemic  cardiomyopathy.  She  was  re-admitted  for  elective  implantation  of  an 
implantable  cardioverter  defibrillator  after  3  months  of  attempted  medical  management  of  her 
cardiomyopathy. The procedure was completed without complication, and the subject was kept in the 
hospital  overnight  for  observation.  At  the  time  of  hospital  discharge,  telemetry  demonstrated  normal 
sinus rhythm without ectopy. No action was taken with OCA in response to the event. The event was 
assessed as not related to OCA by the Investigator and MAH. The subject continued in the study.  
--Subject 3 (Preferred Term: Cardiac failure congestive)  
Type of Event Congestive Cardiac Failure  
Time of Event: Appr. 4 years and 9 months after the start of the LTSE phase  
A female subject with a relevant medical history of antiphospholipid syndrome with previous deep vein 
thrombosis  complicated  by  lung  emboli  at  baseline  was  hospitalized  for  congestive  cardiac  failure. 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 171/319 
 
  
 
 
Treatment during hospitalization included nadroparin. The subject was discharged 4 days later but re-
admitted the following week due to worsening symptoms of congestive cardiac failure, as well as fever, 
elevated  C-reactive  protein,  elevated  troponin,  and  de  novo  atrial  fibrillation.  Treatment  included 
acetylsalicylic  acid,  potassium  chloride,  oxycodone,  furosemide,  methylprednisolone,  paracetamol, 
fondaparinux,  amiodarone,  immunoglobulin  human  normal,  heparin,  and  dalteparin.  The  subject  was 
discharged  from  the  hospital  approximately  10  days  later  with  discharge  diagnoses  of  multiple 
myocardial infarctions due to antiphospholipid syndrome exacerbation (not reported as separate TEAEs 
by the Investigator). No further details are available. No action was taken with OCA in response to the 
event. The event was assessed as possibly related to OCA by the Investigator and assessed as unlikely 
related to OCA by the MAH. The subject continued in the study.  
--Subject 4 (Preferred Terms: Aortic valve stenosis, Ventricular fibrillation, Cardiac failure)  
Type of Event: Aortic valve re-stenosis, ventricular fibrillation  
Time of Event: Approximately 3 months after the start of the LTSE phase  
A  female  subject  with  relevant  medical  history  of  previous  aortic  valve  replacement,  non-ischemic 
cardiomyopathy, implantable defibrillator due to ventricular tachycardias at baseline was admitted to the 
hospital  for  aortic  restenosis  requiring  aortic  valve  replacement  and  also  experienced  ventricular 
fibrillation. The subject had complaints of shortness of breath since prior to starting the LTSE, and had 
undergone diagnostic testing, which had shown severe bioprosthetic aortic valve stenosis. On the day of 
admission, the subject underwent aortic valve replacement with aortic annuloplasty of the Manougian 
variety.  Ventricular  fibrillation  was  noted  during  surgery  and  required  cardioversion.  The  subject  was 
also treated with furosemide for extreme hypervolemia post-surgery. She was discharged approximately 
2 weeks later in good condition. OCA was interrupted during hospitalization and was eventually resumed 
approximately 5 months later. The events were assessed as not related to OCA by the Investigator and 
MAH. The subject continued in the study.  
Type of Event: Cardiac failure  
Time of Event: Approximately 1 year and 4 months after the start of the LTSE phase  
The same subject was later admitted to the hospital for cardiac failure and renal failure. A right heart 
catheterization revealed moderately decreased cardiac output. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed 
Grade  2  diastolic  dysfunction  suggestive  of  increased  mean  left  atrial  pressure,  severe  mitral  and 
tricuspid  regurgitation,  properly  functioning  bioprosthetic  valve  in  the  aortic  position  and  moderate 
pulmonary hypertension. The subject was transferred to another department for acute decompensated 
heart  failure  and  for  evaluation  for  mitral  and  tricuspid  valve  repair.    Her  hospitalization  course  was 
complicated by renal failure due to contrast induced nephropathy requiring ongoing haemodialysis. She 
was eventually discharged approximately 1 month later. OCA was interrupted for approximately 1 month 
as  the  subject  ran  out  of  medicine.  It  was  resumed  after  discharge.  The  event  was  assessed  as  not 
related to OCA by the Investigator and MAH. The subject continued in the study.  
--Subject 5 (Preferred Term: Ischaemic stroke)  
Type of Event Ischaemic Stroke  
Time of Event Approximately 3 years and 5 months after the start of the LTSE phase  
A female subject with no relevant cardiovascular medical history at baseline was hospitalized with an 
ischemic  stroke.  The  subject  presented  with  left-sided  weakness  and  was  administered  a  tissue 
plasminogen activator. MRI of the brain without contrast showed multi-focal small acute infarcts in the 
right frontal and parietal parasagittal cortex. Head computed tomography (CT) showed no evidence for 
haemorrhagic  transformation.  OCA  was  interrupted  during  hospitalization  but  was  resumed  upon 
EMA/528620/2023

discharge. The event was assessed as unlikely related to OCA by the Investigator and MAH. The subject 
continued in the study.  
--Subject 6 (Preferred Term: Atrial fibrillation)  
Type of Event: Atrial fibrillation  
Time of Event: Approximately 4 years and 6 months after the start of the LTSE phase and approximately 
2 weeks after the subject completed the study and initiated commercial Ocaliva.  
A  female  subject  with  no  relevant  cardiovascular  medical  history  at  baseline  was  hospitalized  due  to 
paroxysmal  atrial  fibrillation.  The  subject  reported  acute  onset  of  chest  pain,  spontaneous  signs  of 
exhaustion, and a 3-week history of numbness in the right hand and right foot, without signs of paralysis. 
She was treated with metoprolol and spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm overnight. The subject 
was discharged 2 days later. Action taken with OCA was not applicable as the subject had completed the 
study. The event was assessed as possibly related to OCA by the Investigator and assessed as unlikely 
related to OCA by the MAH.  
--Subject 7 (Preferred Term: Transient ischaemic attack)  
Type of Event Transient ischaemic attack  
Time of Event Approximately 1 year and 9 months after the start of the LTSE phase  
A  female  subject  with  no  relevant  cardiovascular  medical  history  at  baseline  was  hospitalized  with  a 
transient ischemic attack. She reported a short hemiparesis (1-minute duration) on the left side. CT and 
CT  angiography  showed  no  evidence  of  ischemia  haemorrhage  or  significant  hemodynamic  stenosis. 
Treatment included acetylsalicylic acid; valsartan was discontinued. The subject was monitored for a few 
days, and eventually the diagnosis was confirmed as right hemispheric transient ischemic attack. The 
subject  showed  complete  neurological  recovery  and  was  discharged  5  days  after  being  admitted.  No 
action was taken with OCA in response to the event. The event was assessed as not related to OCA by 
the Investigator and MAH. The subject continued in the study.  
--Subject 8 (Preferred Term: Splenic infarction)  
Type of Event Splenic Infarction (complication of Bacterial Endocarditis)  
Time of Event Appr. 6 months after the start of the LTSE phase  
See narrative in Section 2.1.3.3.1  
LTSE – Relevant Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
Renal Biochemistry Markers  
Mean protein, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine values were stable for the duration of the LTSE phase.  
Serum Lipoproteins  
As shown in Figure 24, lipid effects in the LTSE phase were consistent with the double-blind phase. With 
continued OCA treatment, there was no change from baseline in low density lipoprotein (LDL) while the 
modest decreases from baseline in high density lipoprotein (HDL) were sustained during the LTSE phase 
but remained within normal limits. 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 173/319 
 
  
 
 
Serum Glucose  
No meaningful changes in glucose were observed in the total OCA group from Month 3 through Month 
72. One subject with no reported medical history of diabetes had Grade 2 serious TEAE of hypoglycaemia. 
There were no serious TEAEs of uncontrolled diabetes or hyperglycaemia.  
747-301 - LTSE Safety Summary  
Overall, administration of OCA was generally well tolerated over the 5-year LTSE phase in subjects with 
PBC; the safety profile during the LTSE phase was similar to that in the double-blind phase as well as 
the Phase 2 PBC studies with OCA, and no new safety signals were noted.  
A total of 193 subjects received at least 1 dose of OCA during the LTSE. The median number of days on 
OCA was 1924.0 days (5.3 years) from initiation of OCA regardless of the double-blind or LTSE phases. 
The median weighted average daily OCA dose was 8.3 mg.  
The most common TEAE was pruritus, which was mainly mild or moderate in severity. Pruritus frequency 
and severity remained steady after approximately 3 months of OCA treatment.  
Overall, 61 (32%) subjects experienced a serious TEAE. There was no apparent pattern to the types of 
serious  TEAEs.  The  majority  of  serious  TEAEs  were  considered  not  related  to  OCA.  Two  (1%)  deaths 
occurred during the LTSE (one was attributed to sepsis complications from a heart valve replacement 
and  the  other  was  due  to  jaundice  associated  with  acute  alcohol  hepatitis);  and  both  deaths  were 
assessed as unrelated to OCA.  
Cardiovascular-related  safety  was  consistent  with that  reported  in  previous  studies  with  OCA,  and  no 
new findings were noted following long-term treatment with OCA.  
EMA/528620/2023

Hepatic-related  safety  was  consistent  with  that  reported  in  previous  studies  with  OCA,  and  no  new 
findings  were  noted  following  long-term  treatment  with  OCA.  Markers  of  hepatocellular  injury  and 
cholestasis  improved  with  long-term  OCA  treatment.      There  is  no  evidence  for  an  increased  risk  of 
hepatotoxicity in subjects receiving long-term treatment with OCA in the LTSE phase of pivotal study 
747-301 with more than 7 subject-years of exposure.  
• 
The  majority  of  serious  hepatic-related  TEAEs  appeared  to  be  consistent  with  progression  of 
disease and were all considered unlikely or not related to OCA. Most of these subjects had prior medical 
history for which they would be contraindicated per the new proposed SmPC.  
• 
LDL  remained  unchanged  with  long-term  OCA  treatment  and  the  decrease  in  HDL  observed 
during the double-blind phase plateaued during the LTSE phase, with median values remaining above 
the LLN.  
747-301 LTSE Conclusions  
Of the 193 subjects enrolled in the LTSE phase of this study, 76% of the subjects completed the study 
protocol  as  specified  over  6  years,  demonstrating  a  high  retention  rate  and  adherence  to  OCA. 
Throughout  the  duration  of  treatment  with  OCA,  up  to  72  months,  approximately  50%  of  subjects 
achieved  the  primary  composite  endpoint  from  the  double-blind  phase  at  every  timepoint,  indicating 
sustained  and  durable  efficacy.  This  is  of  high  clinical  relevance  given  that  PBC  is  a  progressive  liver 
disease and that most subjects had already failed first line treatment and are at higher risk of disease 
progression. Furthermore, subjects who had been randomized to placebo during the double-blind phase 
and transitioned on to OCA during the LTSE exhibited a nearly identical response to OCA as subjects who 
had been originally randomized into the OCA treatment groups.  
Results from the LTSE phase demonstrated that OCA improved serum markers of cholestasis (ALP and 
GGT) and hepatocellular injury (AST and ALT) in subjects who had been randomized to placebo in the 
double-blind phase of the study, with sustained effects after long-term treatment for up to 72 months. 
Total bilirubin levels remained stable and within the normal range throughout the duration of the study. 
Importantly, total bilirubin levels which had risen in subjects randomized to placebo during the double-
blind phase stabilized within the normal range throughout the LTSE after these subjects had initiated 
OCA. This is of important clinical significance as it has been shown that maintaining bilirubin levels at or 
below ULN is associated with improvement in liver related outcomes over time. Throughout the duration 
of the LTSE, no worsening was observed in non-invasive measures of fibrosis (enhanced liver fibrosis 
and TE), both of which have been associated with disease progression and clinical outcomes in subjects 
with PBC.  
Several  immune,  inflammatory,  and  apoptotic  markers  (ie,  immunoglobulin  M,  TNF-α,  CRP,  CK-18) 
showed improvement (ie, decreased levels) in the double-blind phase that continued to show a durable 
effect through the duration of the LTSE phase. Notably, a biopsy substudy demonstrated that 3 years of 
OCA  treatment  was  generally  associated  with  an  improvement  or  stabilization  of  histologic  fibrosis. 
Results of the post hoc reanalysis of the biopsy substudy were indicative that long-term OCA treatment 
in  patients  with  PBC  is  associated  with  improvement  or  stabilization  across  a  spectrum  of  histologic 
features  of  PBC.  These  data  further  support  that  OCA  impacts  multiple  aspects  of  the  PBC  disease 
pathology.  
Consistent with the known safety profile observed in the double-blind phase of Study 747-301 as well 
as the Phase 2 studies 747-201 and 747-202, OCA treatment was generally well tolerated in subjects 
with PBC, and there were no apparent new safety signals with long-term treatment. There were 2 deaths 
in  the  study  that  occurred  during  the  LTSE,  and  both  were  deemed  unrelated  to  OCA  (see  Section 
2.1.3.3.1  for  details  on  one  additional  death  from  the  double-blind  phase).  As  expected,  mild-to-
moderate  pruritus  was  the  most  common  TEAE  in  subjects  treated  with  OCA.  Pruritus  frequency  and

severity  remained  steady  after  approximately  3  months  of  OCA  treatment.  Ten  percent  of  subjects 
withdrew from the LTSE due to pruritus or any other clinical or laboratory TEAE, and adherence in the 
study was high. Hepatic-related safety was consistent with that reported in previous studies with OCA, 
and no new findings were noted following long-term treatment with OCA.  
Study 747-301 confirms the positive benefit:risk balance in patients with mild to moderate PBC treated 
for up to 6 years. This patient group is representative of what is expected in actual clinical target practice 
and consistent with the current and proposed SmPC. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Patients randomized to placebo in Study 747-301 crossed over to OCA treatment and all patients were 
followed for 5 additional years (747-301 LTSE). The Company was requested to provide a more 
comprehensive presentation of the relevant efficacy and safety results (focusing on SAEs and AESIs) 
from the LTSE of the pivotal study submitted at the time of the initial MA (Study 747-301).  
The LTSE was interrupted prematurely due to Sponsor´s decision, where all patients had a long-term 
follow-up of at least 72 months. A total of 193 subjects were included in the LTSE, of them 47 (24%) 
were discontinued prematurely, 20 (10%) due to AE and 12 (6%) due to patient´s decision.  
For subjects previously randomized to OCA and who continued treatment with OCA in the LTSE, the 
percentage of subjects achieving the primary composite endpoint at the end of the double-blind phase, 
i.e., Month 12 (47% for 5-10 mg OCA and 46% for 10 mg OCA), was sustained over the subsequent 
open-label period. The same pattern was seen for each biochemical parameters (ALP, BR, GGT, AST, 
ALT, and inflammatory markers) for subjects who stay in the study on continued treatment with OCA. 
A similar effect was reached after switching from placebo to OCA in the LTSE. By LTSE Month 60, 
nearly 50% of OCA-treated subjects saw a ≥ 40% improvement in ALP, while BR tended to remain 
within normal values.  
Long-term data show no significant progression of hepatic stiffness (as measured by elastrography) in 
a subset of 106 subjects. The assessment of changes in histology was limited to 17 PBC subjects who 
provided biopsies at baseline and after 3 years on OCA treatment. The planned analysis showed 
improvement in histologic fibrosis in 7/17 subjects, stabilisation 6/17 subjects, and worsening in 4/17 
subjects. A post hoc reanalysis of the biopsy substudy was conducted with a consensus read from 2 
pathologists using the most modern histologic scoring system for PBC (Nakanuma Histologic Staging) 
and automated second harmonic generation imaging for collagen morphometry. The results were: 2/17 
subjects showed improvements in histologic fibrosis, 10/17 showed stabilisation and 5/17 showed 
worsening.  
Overall, the results in liver biochemical parameters, although might overestimate the actual rates of 
treatment responders over time given that these are estimated based on observed data at each time 
point and do not account for the significant rate of discontinuations (24%), overall support the 
maintenance of the effect in the long-term. The assessment of hepatic stiffness and histology also 
provided some supportive evidence, but numbers are limited to selected subsets of subjects and thus, 
a firm conclusion cannot be drawn.  
Overall, 189 (98%) subjects had at least 1 TEAE. A total of 105 (54%) subjects had a severe TEAE 
(incidence largely driven by pruritus), 64 (33%) subjects had a moderate TEAE, 20 (10%) subjects 
had a mild TEAE, and 150 (78%) subjects had a treatment-related TEAE. Two (1%) subjects had a 
TEAE that led to death, but these were considered not treatment related; 61 (32%) subjects had at 
least 1 serious TEAE; and 25 (13%) subjects had a TEAE that led to discontinuation.  
The AE profile in the LTSE phase was consistent with that reported in the double-blind phase, with no 
new findings noted. The most common TEAE by PT was pruritus (132 [68%] subjects), followed by UTI 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 176/319 
 
  
 
 
(24%), nasopharyngitis (23%), and gastrointestinal disorders (nausea (16%), diarrhoea (15%). 
Overall, 61 (32%) subjects had a serious TEAE. Three subjects died across both phases of the study, 2 
in the LTSE phase and 1 in the double-blind phase. Two subjects died during the LTSE, and both 
deaths were considered not related to OCA by the Investigator and the MAH. The above described in 
the LTSE and double-blind phases deaths were unexpected and unrelated to the subjects’ underlying 
liver disease. All subjects had stable synthetic liver function and no evidence of decompensation at 
baseline. The only serious TEAEs reported in more than 1 subject were osteoarthritis (in 6 subjects), 
oesophageal varices haemorrhage (in 4 subjects), radius fracture and pneumonia (in 3 subjects each), 
and pancreatitis, procedural pain, atrial fibrillation, and anaemia (in 2 subjects each). Two of the 
serious TEAEs (atrial fibrillation and cardiac failure congestive) were considered by the Investigator to 
be possibly related to OCA; all other serious TEAEs were considered not related or unlikely related. All 
serious TEAEs resolved with or without sequelae except for the 2 deaths in the LTSE phase and the 
serious TEAEs of chronic myeloid leukaemia and breast cancer, which were ongoing at the end of the 
study.  
Overall, 26 (13%) subjects had a TEAE that led to discontinuation. The only TEAEs that led to 
discontinuation reported in more than 1 subject were pruritus (in 14 subjects) and oesophageal varices 
haemorrhage and fatigue (in 2 subjects each). Several of the TEAEs that led to discontinuation were 
considered by the Investigator to be possibly or probably related to OCA.  
Pruritus was the most reported TEAE, also during the LTSE. Overall, 151 (78%) subjects had an event. 
No subject had a serious TEAE of pruritus. Pruritus TEAEs that led to discontinuation were reported in 
14 subjects. Throughout treatment, more pruritus days were mild than moderate or severe. Pruritus 
frequency and severity remained steady after approximately 3 months of OCA treatment. 
Despite being a relatively mild PBC population, 47 (24%) subjects (Total OCA) had a hepatic-related 
event during the LTSE. The most common events were oesophageal varices in 11 (6%), ascites in 10 
(5%), and hepatic cirrhosis in 7 (4%) subjects, which generally reflected disease progression. Of them, 
only 8 (4.1%) subjects had a serious hepatic-related TEAE during the LTSE phase. Oesophageal 
varices haemorrhage (in 4 subjects) and varices oesophageal (in 2 subjects) were the only serious 
hepatic-related events that occurred in more than 1 subject. Other serious hepatic-related TEAEs were 
reported in a single subject each: hepatic failure, hepatic neoplasm malignant, ascites, and jaundice. 
In general, the types of serious hepatic-related TEAEs appeared to be consistent with progression of 
disease. If this is the normal course of the disease or if OCA treatment is modifying the course, in any 
sense, cannot be ascertain in the absence of a comparator arm. It is agreed with the Company that 
most of the subjects having a serious hepatic event had prior medical history for which they would be 
contraindicated these per the new proposed SmPC, which is reassuring.  
With respect to dyslipemia/ CV events, a total of 19 (10%) subjects had a dyslipemia event, consistent 
with those seen in the double blind: with continued OCA treatment, there was no change from baseline 
in low density lipoprotein (LDL) while the decreases from baseline in high density lipoprotein (HDL) 
were sustained during the LTSE phase but remained within normal limits. Overall, 40 (21%) subjects 
experienced at least 1 cardiovascular disorder event. Eight (4%) subjects had a serious cardiovascular 
disorder TEAE during the LTSE phase, with atrial fibrillation (in 2 subjects) being the only event 
reported in more than 1 subject. A specific pattern of CV events could not be determined, and most 
patients had personal history of cardiac events/risk factors.  
In conclusion, the MAH has presented the requested detailed information from the LTSE of Study 747-
301, the pivotal trial supporting the initial MAA. Overall, long term efficacy data support the 
maintenance of the effect of OCA treatment in liver biochemical and inflammatory parameters. A high 
proportion of patients had a severe TEAE (54%), and SAEs (32%), thought the overall rate of 
treatment discontinuation was relatively low (13%). The safety profile remains unchanged, with 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 177/319 
 
  
 
 
pruritus being the most common bothersome TEAEs, largely responsible for the severe TEAEs. CV 
(21%) and hepatic events (24%) were commonly reported during the trial, though the incidence of 
serious CV and hepatic events was relatively low (around 4% both), and most of these cases occurred 
in patients with underlying conditions or in whom treatment with OCA is currently contraindicated. 
Overall, these data do not raise major concerns, although the absence of a control arm does not allow 
drawing firm conclusions on the actual role of OCA in the incidence of these events.  
This issue is considered solved. The information requested has been provided.  
Study 747-401 
Question 4 
The MAH is invited to present the safety results for this study in more detail and tabulated, including 
details of the nature of severe, serious TEAEs and AESIs, those leading to discontinuation and to 
death.  
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Background  
747-401  was  a  Phase  4,  48-week  study  designed  to  characterize  the  pharmacokinetics  and  safety  of 
obeticholic acid (OCA) in subjects with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) with moderate to severe hepatic 
impairment as this population was not evaluated in the initial submission. It was one of the 2 Specific 
Obligations, and an imposed Post Authorisation Efficacy Study, associated with the Conditional Marketing 
Authorisation.  
This study was conducted based on results from previous Phase 1 and 2 studies that showed doses of 
OCA administered to subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment should be lower than those 
for subjects with normal hepatic function to achieve similar hepatic exposure. To evaluate this, the study 
was  designed  such  that  all  subjects  initiated  investigational  product  once  weekly  with  OCA  5  mg  or 
matching placebo. At Week 12, if the investigational product was tolerated and laboratory assessments 
did not indicate a safety concern, the subject could be up titrated to OCA 5 mg twice weekly.  
The study was planned to recruit approximately 50 patients and approximately 35 study sites globally. 
By  2020,  the  majority  of  targeted  sites  (41/45)  had  been  activated  and  almost  half  of  the  targeted 
number  of  subjects  (22/50)  had  been  enrolled.  In  response  to  Data  Monitoring  Committee 
recommendation and the COVID-19 pandemic, the MAH temporarily halted screening, randomization, 
and site activation. The study was terminated upon the submission of the European Union (EU) Summary 
of Product Characteristics (SmPC) Variation in 2021, with last-subject-last-visit on 09 Jul 2021. Twenty-
two subjects were enrolled (21 assessed as Child Pugh [CP]-B and 1 subject assessed as CP-C).  
Following Ocaliva approval, it became clear that patients with CP-B or CP-cirrhosis were not appropriate 
for Ocaliva treatment due to the increased risk of hepatic failure/decompensation events, including fatal 
cases  observed  in  clinical  trials  and  post-marketing  experience.  In  2021,  regional  labelling  and  the 
Company Core Data Sheet (CCDS) were revised to contraindicate this patient population:  
• 
• 
The United States Prescribing Information (USPI) was revised to contraindicate use of OCA in 
patients  with  decompensated  cirrhosis  or  a  prior  decompensation  event  and  those  with 
compensated cirrhosis with evidence of portal hypertension.  
The  SmPC  was  updated  to  contraindicate  Ocaliva  in  patients  with  decompensated  cirrhosis 
(including CP-B or CP-C) or has had a prior decompensation.  
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 178/319 
 
  
 
 
Notably, all subjects who were enrolled in Study 747-401 would meet the revised contraindicated criteria 
of both the USPI and SmPC.  
Safety findings from Study 747-401, as well as the safety findings in more advanced disease patients in 
Study 747-302 (see Question 10) reinforce that the contraindications are appropriate to ensure a positive 
benefit:risk with the proposed SmPC indicated population (i.e., patients without cirrhosis or compensated 
cirrhosis who had not experienced clinically significant portal hypertension or a previous decompensation 
event prior to initiation of Ocaliva).  
Subject Characteristics  
Per  the  study  design,  baseline  characteristics  were  consistent  with  a  population  of  PBC  subjects  with 
moderate to advanced cirrhosis. Key baseline laboratory variables indicative of intrahepatic cholestasis 
and synthetic hepatic function are summarized in Table 34.

Extent of Exposure  
In the double-blind phase and double-blind extension phase, the overall mean duration of exposure to 
study treatment was 296.5 days in the OCA and 233.4 days in the placebo groups. 
Summary of Adverse Events  
All 10 (100.0%) subjects in the OCA and 12 (100.0%) subjects in the placebo groups reported at least 
1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) during the double-blind phase and double-blind extension 
phase of the study. Treatment-related TEAEs occurred in 4 (40.0%) subjects in the OCA group and 6 
(50.0%) subjects in the placebo group. Nine (90.0%) subjects in the OCA group and 9 (75.0%) subjects 
in the placebo group experienced TEAEs of special interest. Six (60.0%) subjects in the OCA group and 
7 (58.3%) subjects in the placebo group experienced severe TEAEs. Overall, study treatment or study 
discontinuations occurred in 5 (50.0%) subjects in the OCA and 5 (41.7%) in the placebo groups and 
study treatment interruptions occurred in 5 (50.0%) subjects in the OCA and 4 (33.3%) subjects in the 
placebo groups. A total of 7 (70.0%) subjects in the OCA and 9 (75.0%) subjects in the placebo groups 
experienced serious adverse events (SAEs). Five subjects died during the study. One of the deaths (clear 
cell renal cell carcinoma; placebo group) occurred within the study period; however, was reported after 
database lock. All 5 cases are described in Section 2.2.4.

Most Common Adverse Events by Preferred Term  
The  most  common  TEAEs  were  ascites,  oesophageal  varices  haemorrhage,  pneumonia,  urinary  tract 
infection, pruritus, and anaemia in the OCA group.

Adverse Events by Maximum Severity  
In the double-blind phase and double-blind extension phase, the majority of reported TEAEs were mild 
(Grade 1) or moderate (Grade 2) in severity. A total of 6 (60.0%) subjects in the OCA and 7 (58.3%) 
subjects in the placebo groups experienced severe (Grade 3) TEAEs (Table 39). Related Grade 3 TEAEs 
included upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage, hepatic failure, pyrexia, and hepatic function abnormal. 
Of the Grade 3 TEAEs, 4  subjects experienced a TEAE (multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, cardiac 
arrest,  hepatic  encephalopathy,  and  aortic  aneurysm  rupture,  respectively)  that  resulted  in  a  fatal 
outcome,  which  were  all not  related or  unlikely  related  to the  study  treatment,  were  reported  before 
database lock, and are further described in Section 2.2.4.

Treatment-Emergent  Adverse  Events  Leading  to  Discontinuation  of  Study  Treatment  or  Study 
Discontinuation  
Overall, in the double-blind phase and double-blind extension phase, TEAEs leading to study treatment 
withdrawal or study discontinuation occurred in 5 (50.0%) subjects in the OCA and 5 (41.7%) subjects 
in the placebo groups (Table 40). Four subjects (3 OCA-treated and 1 placebo-treated) experienced a 
TEAE  (upper  gastrointestinal  haemorrhage,  COVID-19,  cardiac  arrest,  and  hydrothorax,  respectively) 
that led to both study drug withdrawal and study discontinuation. One OCA-treated subject experienced 
a TEAE of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, which led to study drug withdrawal and was fatal.

Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Leading to Study Drug Interruption  
Overall, in the double-blind phase and double-blind extension phase, TEAEs leading to study treatment 
interruption occurred in 5 (50%) subjects in the OCA and 4 (33.3%) subjects in the placebo groups. The 
most common TEAE leading to study treatment interruption in subjects within the double-blind phase 
and  double-blind  extension  phase  was  ascites  (2  [20.0%]  subjects  in  OCA  and  1  [8.3%]  in  placebo 
groups).

Deaths  
There  were  5  deaths  in  the  study  (3  in  placebo-treated  subjects:  hepatic  encephalopathy,  aortic 
aneurysm rupture, and clear cell renal cell carcinoma; and 2 in OCA-treated subjects: multiple organ 
dysfunction syndrome and cardiac arrest). All were assessed by the Investigator as not related or unlikely 
related to the study treatment. The death from clear cell renal cell carcinoma occurred within the study 
period, however, was reported after database lock.  
--Subject 1  
Cause of Death: Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome  
Time of Death: Approximately 2 years, 2 months, 3 weeks and 1 day after the subject initiated the study 
drug, and 1 day after the subject’s second OCA 10 mg twice weekly dose on Day 813 (Week 69) of the 
double-blind extension phase. A male subject was hospitalized following an incidence of collapse. He had 
multiple organ failure. On Day 821, the subject died, predominantly due to acute kidney injury, which 
was  on  a  background  of  chronic  kidney  disease,  decompensated  cirrhosis,  and  cardiogenic  shock.  An 
autopsy was not performed. Per the death certificate, the chain of events that caused the death of this 
subject included acute liver failure and acute congestive heart failure exacerbation; significant conditions 
contributing  to  death  included  acute  kidney  failure  and  PBC.  The  SAE  of  multiple  organ  dysfunction 
syndrome was considered by the Investigator and the MAH as not related to OCA.  
--Subject ID 2 
Cause of Death: Hepatic encephalopathy  
Time of Death: Approximately 13 days after the initiation of placebo once weekly, and 6 days since the 
last  dose  prior  to  the  event  during  the  double-blind  phase.  A  female  subject  presented  with  hepatic 
encephalopathy and was hospitalized. On Day 19, the subject died from hepatic encephalopathy, which 
was considered unlikely related to placebo by the Investigator and the MAH. The subject had a medical 
history of intermittent confusion, aortic stenosis, left breast cancer, lower bilateral extremity oedema, 
cirrhosis, ascites, and decompensated liver disease.  
--Subject 3 
Cause of Death Clear cell renal cell carcinoma  
Time of Death Approximately 1 year, 3 months and 22 days after the initiation of placebo  
The female subject experienced worsening of pruritus during an interruption of investigational product. 
The subject’s CP score was Class B and MELD score was 17 at that time. The Investigator site noted that 
the subject was not on study medication, thus considered the increased pruritus to be related to disease 
progression (considered an SAE) assessed as an important medical event. Ten months and 5 days after 
the  last  administered  dose  (Day  176)  of  study  treatment  (placebo  once  weekly),  the  subject  was 
diagnosed with clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Approximately 1 month and 5 days after removal of the 
subject’s right kidney tumour, the subject died from clear cell renal cell carcinoma (Grade 1), which was 
considered not related to placebo by the Investigator and the MAH.  
--Subject 4 
Cause of Death: Aortic aneurysm rupture  
Time of Death: Approximately 3 weeks and 5 days after the initiation of placebo, and 3 days after the 
subject’s last dose of placebo once weekly during the double-blind phase. A male subject died from a 
ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, which was considered not related to placebo by the Investigator 
and the MAH. The subject had a known history of aortic aneurysm prior to the start of the study.  
--Subject 5 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 185/319 
 
  
 
 
Cause of Death: Cardiac arrest  
Time of Death: Approximately 1 month and 4 days after the subject initiated the study drug, and 6 days 
after the subject’s dose of OCA 5 mg once weekly during the double-blind phase. A male subject was 
hospitalized due to gastrointestinal bleeding from oesophageal varices. During the endoscopy procedure, 
the subject experienced cardiac arrest, which was fatal. The cardiac arrest was considered a consequence 
of  the  bleeding  from  gastroesophageal  varices  and  was  assessed  as  not  related  to  OCA  by  the 
Investigator and the MAH.  
Other Serious Adverse Events  
Overall, in the double-blind phase and double-blind extension phase, a total of 7 (70.0%) subjects in 
the OCA group and 9 (75.0%) subjects in the placebo group experienced SAEs (Table 42). Notable SAEs 
of upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage and hepatic failure are described below.  
- A female subjectexperienced 2 events of upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage in the OCA group, which 
were deemed by the Investigator as possibly related to the study treatment. The MAH assessed both 
events of upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage as unlikely related to the study treatment. The subject 
had advanced hepatic disease as evidenced by a history of cirrhosis with hepatomegaly, oesophageal 
varices  (as  observed  on  esophagogastroduodenoscopy),  gastropathy,  and  portal  hypertensive 
gastropathy. The episodes of upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage in this subject were likely related to 
the subject’s established advanced chronic liver disease and the pre-existing oesophageal varices.  
- A female subjectexperienced 1 event of hepatic failure in the OCA group, which was deemed by the 
Investigator as probably related to the study treatment. Approximately 2 months after the initiation of 
investigational  product,  the  subject  was  hospitalized  due  to  an  important  medical  event  of  liver 
decompensation (preferred term: hepatic failure; considered a serious AE). The MAH assessed the event 
of hepatic failure as possibly related to the study treatment. PBC is a progressive disease that can be 
complicated by hepatic failure after many years and development of advanced disease. However, there 
is  insufficient  information  to  assess  the  relatedness  with  any  degree  of  certainty,  and  therefore,  it  is 
possible that study treatment may have contributed to the onset of the event.

Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Overall, in the double-blind phase and double-blind extension phase, a total of 9 (90.0%) subjects in 
the OCA and 9 (75.0%) subjects in the placebo groups experienced adverse events of special interest 
(AESIs) (Table 43). 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 187/319 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Hepatic AESIs  
Overall, in the double-blind phase and double-blind extension phase, 9 (90.0%) subjects in the OCA and 
8 (66.7%) subjects in the placebo groups had a hepatic-related AESI (Table 43). Nine subjects (OCA: 4 
[40.0%]  subjects;  placebo:  5  [41.7%]  subjects)  had  a  severe  (Grade  3)  hepatic-related  AESI.  Nine 
subjects (OCA: 4 [40%] subjects; placebo: 5 [41.7%] subjects) had experienced at least 1 SAE. Three 
subjects  (OCA:  1  [10.0%]  subject;  placebo:  2  [16.7%]  subjects)  had  hepatic-related  AESIs  (hepatic 
failure, hepatic encephalopathy, and liver transplant, respectively) leading to study treatment or study 
discontinuation. Of the 29 reported AESIs, 6 were mild (Grade 1) in severity, 11 were moderate (Grade 
2) in severity, and 12 were severe (Grade 3) in severity. A total of 24 were considered not related or 
unlikely  related  to  study  treatment,  and  5  were  considered  possibly  or  probably  related  to  study 
treatment.  
Assessment for Potential Liver Injury  
Potential liver injury cases were identified by predefined triggers and assessed according to the Hepatic 
Safety  Committee  Charter.  Two  of  22  cases  (in  20  subjects)  sent  for  adjudication  were  assessed  as 
possibly related to study treatment (1 placebo, 1 OCA).  
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 188/319 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Eighty-six triggers for potential liver injury were identified from 20 unique subjects. Of these triggers, 
16 had no evidence of liver injury. The remaining 70 triggers were assessed as potential liver injury and 
were grouped into 22 cases that were sent for blinded adjudication. Twenty (90.9%) of these 22 cases 
were assessed as unlikely related to study treatment. The remaining 2 cases, 1 in the placebo arm and 
1 in the OCA arm, were assessed as possibly related to study treatment. Comments from the Hepatic 
Safety Committee panel are summarized below:  
-A male subject (placebo once weekly; possibly related): Shortly after starting study drug, the subject 
developed encephalopathy. This subject had a history of cirrhosis at entry and the encephalopathy could 
have been related to study drug, which the subject improved following discontinuation of study drug.  
-A  female  subject  (OCA  5  mg  once  weekly;  possibly  related):  This  subject  had  elevated  bilirubin  at 
baseline with >1.5x baseline increase occurring 2 months after start of study drug, at which time the 
study drug was stopped. No changes from baseline in ALT, AST, GGT, or ALP were noted. The subject 
had  a  history  of  ooesophageal  varices  since  2016  and  developed  pruritus  3  days  after  start  of  study 
drug. Relatedness to the study drug cannot be excluded with the limited data provided.  
Cholelithiasis/Cholecystectomy AESIs  
No TEAEs of cholelithiasis or cholecystectomy were reported during the study.  
Cardiovascular AESIs  
Overall, in the double-blind phase and double-blind extension phase, 3 (30.0%) subjects in the OCA and 
1 (8.3%) subject in the placebo groups had a cardiovascular-related AESI (Table 43). No subjects had 
a  severe  (Grade  3)  cardiovascular-related  AESI.  One  subject  in  the  OCA  group  had  an  SAE  of  acute 
myocardial infarction, which was moderate (Grade 2) in severity and was not related to study treatment 
(747-401 CSR, Listing 16.2.7.1).  
One male subject had Grade 2 (moderate) coronary artery disease, which resulted in a coronary stent 
placement, and a Grade 2 SAE of acute myocardial infarction, from which the subject had recovered. 
The  subject  continued  in  the  study  without  further  cardiac  issues,  however,  later  experienced  a  fatal 
TEAE of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (Section 2.2.4). This subject had a relevant medical history 
of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Another subject who had Grade 1 (mild) angina pectoris, 
recovered, and continued in the study without further cardiac issues, however, later discontinued the 
study due to a TEAE of upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage. No cardiovascular-related AESIs leading to 
study treatment or study discontinuation were reported. Of the 6 reported AESIs, 2 were mild (Grade 1) 
in severity, 4 were moderate (Grade 2) in severity, all were considered not related to study treatment.  
Renal AESIs  
Overall, in the double-blind phase and double-blind extension phase, 3 (30.0%) subjects in the OCA and 
3 (25.0%) subjects in the placebo groups had a renal-related AESI (Table 43). No subjects had a severe 
(Grade 3) renal-related AESI. One subject in the placebo group had an SAE of acute kidney injury, which 
was moderate (Grade 2) in severity, resulted in drug interruption, and was assessed as possibly related 
to  study  treatment.    No  renal-related  AESIs  led  to  study  treatment  or  study  discontinuation  were 
reported. Of the 12 reported AESIs, 5 were mild (Grade 1) in severity, 7 were moderate (Grade 2) in 
severity, 8 were not related to study treatment, and 4 were considered possibly or probably related to 
study treatment.  
Pruritus AESIs  
Overall, in the double-blind phase and double-blind extension phase, 3 (30.0%) subjects in the OCA and 
2 (16.7%) subjects in the placebo had a pruritus-related AESI (Table 43). Time to onset of first TEAE of 
pruritus was 4 to 84 days in the OCA group versus 22 to 56 days in the placebo group. No subjects had 
a severe (Grade 3) or serious TEAE of pruritus. No pruritus-related AESIs leading to study treatment or

study discontinuation were reported. Of the 8 reported AESIs, all were mild (Grade 1) in severity, 7 were 
considered not related or unlikely related to study treatment, and 1 was considered probably related to 
study treatment (OCA). 
Summary and Conclusion of Study 747-401:  
At the time of Ocaliva approval in 2016, there were limited clinical data available for OCA treatment in 
patients  with  PBC  suffering  from  more  advanced  liver  disease.  Results  from  previous  Phase  1  and  2 
studies  showed  doses  of  OCA  administered  to  patients  with  moderate  or  severe  hepatic  impairment 
should be lower than those for patients with normal hepatic function to achieve similar hepatic exposure. 
Thus, the initial labelling included a weekly dosing regimen for PBC patients with moderate (CP-B) and 
severe  (CP-C)  hepatic  impairment  of  5  mg  twice  weekly  (at  least  3  days  apart  between  doses)  and 
subsequently to 10 mg twice weekly (at least three days apart between doses) depending on response 
and tolerability.  
Subject recruitment and retention in Study 747-401 were challenging given the availability of marketed 
Ocaliva was a significant disincentive to subjects with progressive liver disease to take part in a placebo-
controlled study.  
Following Ocaliva approval, it became clear that patients with CP-B or CP-C cirrhosis were not appropriate 
for Ocaliva treatment due to the increased risk of hepatic failure/decompensation events, including fatal 
cases observed in clinical trials and post-marketing experience. In 2021, regional labelling and the CCDS 
were revised to contraindicate this patient population:  
-The USPI was revised to contraindicate use of OCA in patients with decompensated cirrhosis or a prior 
decompensation event and those with compensated cirrhosis with evidence of portal hypertension.  
-The SmPC was updated to contraindicate Ocaliva in patients with decompensated cirrhosis (including 
CP-B or CP-C) or has had a prior decompensation.  
Notably, all subjects who were enrolled in Study 747-401 would meet the revised contraindicated criteria 
of both the USPI and SmPC.  
Safety findings from Study 747-401, as well as the safety findings in more advanced disease subjects in 
Study 747-302 (see Question 10) reinforce that the contraindications are appropriate to ensure a positive 
benefit:risk with the proposed SmPC indicated population (i.e., patients without cirrhosis or compensated 
cirrhosis who had not experienced clinically significant portal hypertension or a previous decompensation 
event prior to initiation of Ocaliva). 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Study 747-401 was a one of the agreed SOB at the time of granting the CMA. This was a RCT, placebo 
controlled study conducted in PBC subjects with moderate to severe hepatic impairment to assess PK 
and safety. The study only included a total 22 subjects, out of to the initially planned 50 subjects, due 
to  retention  difficulties  and  its  premature  interruption  once  the  new  SmPC  contraindications  were 
included.  
Despite testing a reduced dose of OCA (5mg once a week, titrated to 5mg twice a week), treatment was 
poorly  tolerated  in  both  treatment  arms.  All  22  (100.0%)  subjects  reported  at  least  1  treatment-
emergent  adverse  event  (TEAE).  The  most  common  TEAEs  were  ascites,  oesophageal  varices 
haemorrhage,  pneumonia,  all  of  them  reported  most  in  OCA  treated  arm.  Treatment-related  TEAEs 
occurred in 4 (40.0%) subjects in the OCA group and 6 (50.0%) subjects in the placebo group. Nine 
(90.0%) subjects in the OCA group and 9 (75.0%) subjects in the placebo group experienced TEAEs of 
special interest. Six (60.0%) subjects in the OCA group and 7 (58.3%) subjects in the placebo group 
experienced  severe  (Grade  3)  TEAEs.  Related  Grade  3  TEAEs  included  upper  gastrointestinal 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 190/319 
 
  
 
 
haemorrhage, hepatic failure, pyrexia, and hepatic function abnormal. Of the Grade 3 TEAEs, 4 subjects 
experienced a TEAE (multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, cardiac arrest, hepatic encephalopathy, and 
aortic aneurysm rupture, respectively) that resulted in a  fatal outcome, which were all not related or 
unlikely related to the study treatment. Overall, study treatment or study discontinuations occurred in 5 
(50.0%) subjects in the OCA and 5 (41.7%) in the placebo groups and study treatment interruptions 
occurred in 5 (50.0%) subjects in the OCA and 4 (33.3%) subjects in the placebo groups. Four subjects 
(3  OCA-treated  and  1  placebo-treated)  experienced  a  TEAE  of  upper  gastrointestinal  haemorrhage, 
cardiac  arrest  secondary  to  bleeding  from  oesophageal  varices,  hepatobiliary  disorder,  and  ascites, 
respectively)  that  led  to  both  study  drug  withdrawal  and  study  discontinuation.  A  total  of  7  (70.0%) 
subjects in the OCA and 9 (75.0%) subjects in the placebo groups experienced serious adverse events 
(SAEs).  Six  out  of  the  7  subjects  in  OCA  reported  SAEs  of  bleeding  of  oesophageal  varices/upper  GI 
haemorrhage (4 cases) or cardiac arrest/MI (2) vs no subjects in placebo. Five subjects died during the 
study (3 in placebo-treated subjects: hepatic encephalopathy, aortic aneurysm rupture, and clear cell 
renal cell carcinoma; and 2 in OCA-treated subjects: multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and cardiac 
arrest).  
Overall, no relevant differences were observed between treatment arms in the incidences of TEAEs, G3 
TEAEs, SAEs TEAEs, and those noted can be explained by the low number of subjects in each treatment 
arm.  Indeed,  the  low  number  of  subjects  included  and  premature  study  interruption,  do  not  allow 
reaching sound conclusions on the actual safety profile of OCA in PBC with an advanced liver disease. 
Nevertheless,  a  numerical  difference  between  treatment  arms,  disfavouring  OCA  treatment,  is 
systematically observed for hepatic AESI (9 patients (14 events) OCA vs 8 patients (11 events) placebo), 
cardiac AESIs (3 patients 5 events in OCA vs 1 subject/event placebo), pruritus (3 OCA vs 1placebo), 
and  bleeding  GI  events  (both  G3  and  SAEs  were  reported  in  OCA  patients  while  no  such  cases  were 
reported in placebo [4 in OCA: 3 events of bleeding of oesophageal varices +1 upper GI haemorrhage 
OCA treated groups]), which should be noted and support the current contraindication in the SmPC.   
Issue partially solved, but not further pursued within this procedure. The information requested 
has  been  provided.  The  study  results  point  towards  a  higher  toxicity  in  patients  with  advanced  PBC. 
Treatment  with  OCA  is  currently  contraindicated  in  this  PBC  patients,  however  inconsistent 
recommendations  are  included in  Section  4.4.  A  revised  proposal to  monitor disease  progression  and 
interrupt  treatment  with  OCA  in  patients  who  progress  to  advanced  PBC  stages  with  OCA  should  be 
included.  
Question 5 
OCA treatment is contraindicated in “Patients with decompensated cirrhosis (e.g., Child-Pugh 
Class B or C) or a prior decompensation event (see section 4.4)”, due to the increased risk of 
hepatic  failure/decompensation  events,  including  fatal  cases.  Measures  have  been  put  in 
place to minimise this risk, i.e. a contraindication in section 4.3 and precautionary wording in 
section 4.4 of the SmPC to include new information about hepatic decompensation and failure, 
sometimes fatal or resulting in liver transplant, occurring with obeticholic acid treatment in 
patients  with  PBC  with  cirrhosis,  either  compensated  or  decompensated.  Section  4.8 
(‘Undesirable effects’) was also updated to include hepatobiliary disorders in the tabulated 
list of adverse reactions. It is uncertain if these measures are currently (effectively) in place 
in clinical practice and sufficient to minimise these risks, but probably it is too early to know. 
The MAH is invited to comment, and should commit to monitor the actual effectiveness of this 
RMM in clinical practice.

Summary of the MAH’s response 
Following  the  termination  of  study  747-401,  the  MAH  has  implemented  risk  minimization  measures 
(RMMs)  in  June/July  2022  i.e.,  updated  European  Union  (EU)  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics 
(SmPC) and “Dear Health Care Professional communication” (DHPC) to emphasize the risks related to 
hepatic adverse events following initiation of treatment with Ocaliva (obeticholic acid [OCA]).  
The  MAH  has  conducted  a  cumulative  review  until  15  May  2023  of  the  available  data  to  assess  the 
effectiveness  of  the  actual  RMMs,  and  the  result  of  this  review  is  presented  in  the  section  below 
(Effectiveness check of implemented RMMs).  
This review has shown a decrease in frequency/trend of hepatic events suggesting a positive trend post 
implementation  of  RMMs.    The  MAH  commits  to  assessing  the  effectiveness  of  the  implemented  and 
newly  proposed  RMMs  going  forward.  In  the  future,  the  MAH  proposes  to  perform  a  6-monthly 
effectiveness check and any significant negative impact/no impact will be submitted.  
Effectiveness Check of Implemented RMM  
Background:  
OCA was first approved in the United States (US) on 27 May 2016. Conditional approval in the EU was 
granted  on  12  Dec  2016.  Approvals  were  granted  under  the  tradename  Ocaliva  for  the  treatment  of 
primary  biliary  cholangitis  (PBC)  in  combination  with  ursodeoxycholic  acid  (UDCA)  in  adults  with  an 
inadequate response to UDCA, or as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA.  
According to the initially approved SmPC, Ocaliva was contraindicated in patients with complete biliary 
obstruction and there was a specific warning pertaining to liver-related adverse events (AEs) (elevations 
in ALT and AST, and clinical signs and symptoms of hepatic decompensation) and severe pruritus. In 
2018, the US  Food  and Drug  Administration  (FDA)  published  a  Drug Safety  Communication  clarifying 
hepatic decompensation and failure occurred in patients with decompensated and Child Pugh (CP)-B and 
CP-C cirrhosis who were dosed more frequently than recommended in patients treated with OCA.  
The  EU  SmPC  was  subsequently  updated  highlighting  the  recommended  dosing  in  patients  with 
decompensated or CP-B or CP-C cirrhosis in Sections 4.2 and 4.4. The updated SmPC was endorsed by 
Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) and approved by the EU Commission on 23 
Mar 2018. In addition, reinforced differential dosing recommendations for Ocaliva in PBC patients with 
decompensated  or  CP-B  or  CP-C  cirrhosis  were  communicated  via  a  DHPC  as  agreed  with 
Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee in 2018.  
Following termination of Study 747-401, hepatic updates to the EU SmPC were submitted to CHMP on 
01 Jul 2021 updating Section 4.3 to include contraindication in patients with decompensated cirrhosis 
(CP-B or CP-C) or a prior decompensation event, and Section 4.4 to include new warning on monitoring 
and management of patients for possible progression of PBC and other hepatic AEs and was approved 
in Jul 2022.  
As a part of this assessment, CHMP had also requested the MAH to distribute a second DHPC related to 
contraindication  in  patients  with  decompensated  cirrhosis  (CP-B  or  CP-C)  or  a  prior  decompensation 
event, also to sensitize the health care providers on monitoring and management of patients for possible 
progression of PBC and other hepatic adverse events in Ocaliva (OCA) treated patients. The same was 
disseminated in June 2022.  
The product was Conditionally Approved in the EU in the context of successful closure of Studies 747-
302  (Efficacy  and  Safety)  and  747-401  (Pharmacokinetics  and  Safety).  However,  these  studies  were 
prematurely closed after informing Health Authorities. Study reports were submitted in Dec 2022 as a 
Type II Variation. As part of the assessment of the shared study data, the MAH received the above query 
related to effectiveness of the implemented RMMs.  
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 192/319 
 
  
 
 
The MAH is committed to assessing the effectiveness of the implemented RMMs. This document presents 
the first assessment the MAH has conducted based on the cumulative data until 15 May 2023. Going 
forward the MAH will update this assessment on a 6-monthly basis.  
A search was conducted in the Global Safety Database for OCA and the post-marketing data captured 
are from the date of approval until 15 May 2023. Out of the cumulative data, the MAH has evaluated 
post-marketing  datasets  from  EU,  United  Kingdom  and  Rest  of  the  World  (excluding  US)  to  identify 
hepatic AEs which are included in the Standardised MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) 
Queries  (SMQ):  “Hepatic  Disorders  SMQ  (broad),  excluding  the  following  sub-SMQs:  alcohol  related; 
congenital, familial, neonatal, and genetic disorders of the liver; liver infections; and pregnancy-related 
hepatic disorders.” as per MedDRA version 26.0.  
This search retrieved 726 case reports which included 1151 Hepatic AEs. Of these 726 case reports, 237 
were serious (32.65 %), and 489 were non-serious case reports (67.34 %). Out of 1151 Hepatic AEs 
reported, 338 were serious (29.37%) and 814 were non-serious AEs (70.72%).  
Out of these 726 unique case reports, there were:  
• 
• 
11 reports where the patient had a history of compensated liver disease  
20 reports where the patient had a history of decompensated liver disease at the time of OCA 
treatment initiation 
• 
45  case  reports  where  the  patient  experienced  hepatic  decompensation  post  initiation  of 
treatment with OCA  
• 
25  case  reports  mentioning  indication  of  PBC  with  CP-B  and  in  6  case  reports  mentioning 
indication of PBC with CP-C  
The MAH has followed 2 approaches to conduct the analysis:  
Quantitative analysis:  
The analysis was performed based on the number of AEs from the Hepatic SMQ: “Drug-related hepatic 
disorders - comprehensive search” in comparison with “per 100 patients-years exposed” to OCA in the 
regions where MAH holds an active license.  
Estimations of post-marketing exposure data are based on sales distribution in EU, United Kingdom, and 
Rest  of  the  World  (excluding  US).  Each  unit  (bottle)  of  OCA  contains  30  tablets.  As  per  the  SmPC, 
recommended dose is one tablet daily. Based on the response, the strength can be increased, however 
frequency remains 1 tablet daily. Hence one unit can signify one patient for 30 days.  
The number of patients exposed to OCA has been calculated based on patient treatment years (PTY) 
using the formula mentioned below, where total number of units sold is equivalent of number of bottles 
sold,  since  each  bottle  contains  30  tablets  covering  30  days  (number  of  tablets  sold  is  equal  to  sold 
units*30).  
To  calculate  frequency  of  hepatic  AEs  for  the  relevant  time  period,  the  following  formula  was  further 
used:  
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 193/319 
 
  
 
 
 
 
According  to  data  presented  in  Table  45  and  Figure  26,  there is  a  continuous  downward  trend  in  the 
reporting rate of hepatic AEs  from 2017 until 2023. This trend can further be correlated with various 
milestones in the lifecycle of OCA since approval. The trend shows a clear decline in hepatic AEs from:  
• 
2017  to  2018,  indicating  a  better  understanding  of  the  drug  and  its  usage  by  healthcare 
professionals  
• 
2018 to 2019, a slight increase of liver AE frequency, followed by a decrease from 2019 to 2021 
which is aligned with the RMM measure of the DHPC dissemination in 2018 and adoption by healthcare 
professionals over the time  
2021  to  2023,  post  implementation  of  RMM  of  SmPC  update  and  rolling  out  another  DHPC  in 
• 
2022  
In the EU specifically, the frequency has further declined from 0.612 to 0.468 post implementation of 
RMMs.

Qualitative Analysis:  
A search was conducted in the Global Safety Database for OCA and the data captured were from the 
date of approval until 15 May 2023. Out of the cumulative data, the MAH has evaluated post-marketing 
dataset from the EU, United Kingdom, and Rest of the World excluding US to identify hepatic AEs which 
are  included  in  the  SMQ:  “Drug-related  hepatic  disorders  -  comprehensive  search”  as  per  MedDRA 
version 26.0. This search retrieved 726 case reports which included 1151 hepatic AEs.  
MAH has reviewed all the 726 case reports including 1151 hepatic AEs, irrespective of outcome of the 
AEs, and analysis is as provided below:  
• 
Out of 726 case reports related to hepatic events, 337 had minimal information to conclude any 
meaningful causal relationship with OCA.  
• 
Three  hundred  eighty  reports  described  other  confounding  information  to  conclude  any 
meaningful causal relationship with OCA.  
• 
Nine cases were assessed with probable causal relationship based on temporal relationship and 
positive de-challenge. In these cases, reported hepatic AEs were assessed as listed in line with EU SmPC. 
No new relevant safety information was identified in these cases.  
The MAH concluded no new relevant safety information was identified during the qualitative analysis.  
Analysis of Fatal Case Reports  
Out  of  726  case  reports,  there  were  31  with  a  fatal  outcome.  Of  these  31  reports,  in  20  cases  fatal 
outcome was associated with hepatic AEs and in remaining 11 reports fatal outcome was associated with 
other causes (scleroderma, transplantation complication, renal disorder, breast cancer metastatic, upper 
gastrointestinal haemorrhage, lung disorder, pneumonia and sepsis or unknown cause of death).  
A decrease in the number of fatal hepatic AEs has also been observed. Twenty reports having hepatic 
AEs with a fatal outcome were identified between 2017-2023. In the year 2017, 1 fatal hepatic AE was 
reported, 3 were reported in 2018, 6 cases in 2019, 4 cases each 2020 and 2021, and 1 case in 2022 
and 2023 up to date. 
In 20 cases with fatal outcome (associated with hepatic AEs), a total of 23 hepatic AEs were identified. 
The summary is provided below:  
A female patient with medical history of PBC, multiple sclerosis, and allergies to tetracycline, Bactrim 
(sulfamethoxazole,  trimethoprim),  sulpha  drugs,  Tylenol  (acetaminophen),  methoxazole,  and  Flagyl 
(metronidazole)  received  Ocaliva  5  mg  orally  daily  for  PBC  and  7  months  after  drug  initiation,  she 
experienced fatal event of liver failure. CP-C was reported at some point during the treatment. Ocaliva 
was discontinued several weeks before the time of the patient's death.

MAH  Comment:  The  death  has  been  assessed  as  unlikely  related  to  OCA  in  line  with  the  progressive 
nature of patient’s underlying medical conditions (PBC and multiple sclerosis) and patient’s advancing 
age.  
A patient of unknown age and sex on Ocaliva therapy for PBC experienced fatal liver failure. The physician 
noted that the patient used Ocaliva too late. No further information was reported.  
MAH  Comment:  The  death  has  been  assessed  as  unlikely  related  to  OCA  due  to  limited  information 
regarding drug start date, drug dosing details, event onset date, action taken with OCA, details about 
medical history and concomitant medications.  
A  patient  of  unknown  age  and  sex  on  Ocaliva  via  unknown  dose,  frequency,  and  route  for  PBC 
experienced fatal liver failure. The physician noted that he used Ocaliva too late.  
MAH  Comment:  The  death  has  been  assessed  as  unlikely  related  to  OCA  due  to  limited  information 
regarding drug start date, drug dosing details, event onset date, action taken with OCA, details about 
medical history and concomitant medications.  
An  adult  patient  of  unspecified  age  and  sex  with  PBC  died  due  to  cirrhosis  of  liver  while  on  Ocaliva 
initiated at an unspecified date, dose, and frequency via oral route.  
MAH  Comment:  The  death  has  been  assessed  as  unlikely  related  to  OCA  due  to  limited  information 
regarding drug start date, drug dosing details, event onset date, action taken with OCA, details about 
medical history and concomitant medications.  
An adult patient of unspecified age and sex with PBC experienced bleeding oesophageal varices after an 
unknown duration while on Ocaliva initiated at an unspecified date, dose, and frequency.  
MAH  Comment:  The  death  has  been  assessed  as  unlikely  related  to  OCA  due  to  limited  information 
regarding drug start date, drug dosing details, event onset date, action taken with OCA, details about 
medical history and concomitant medications.  
A female patient with medical history of PBC and CP-C was unresponsive to UDCA and bezafibrate. The 
patient  was  treated  with  Ocaliva  (5  mg  oral  weekly)  for  PBC  and  experienced  the  fatal  events  of 
“advanced  PBC”  and  “decompensated  cirrhosis”  on  an  unknown  date.  After  approximately  4  months, 
Ocaliva  was  discontinued  due  to  the  patient’s  continued  deterioration  and  1  month  later  developed 
decompensated cirrhosis. The patient died due to advanced PBC and decompensated cirrhosis.  
MAH  Comment:  The  death  has  been  assessed  as  unlikely  related  to  OCA.  Fatality  in  this  case  is 
confounded by advanced stage of underlying medical condition PBC Child Pugh class C, with a likely poor 
prognosis, prior to initiation of OCA.  
A female patient on Ocaliva 5 mg daily for PBC experienced a fatal event of decompensated liver failure 
and serious hepatic events of hepatorenal syndrome and ischemic hepatopathy requiring hospitalization. 
Patient’s  medical  history  included  PBC,  CP-A,  cirrhosis,  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease, 
dyslipidaemia,  peripheral  vascular  disease,  transient  ischemic  attack,  bilateral  kidney  stones,  chronic 
pain  syndrome,  cholecystectomy,  total  knee  replacement,  low  haemoglobin,  low  potassium,  excess 
weight loss, anaemia, drug allergies to Aspirin and codeine. Concomitant medications included UDCA, 
hydromorphcontin 
(hydromorphone 
hydrochloride), 
gabapentin,  Dilaudid 
(hydromorphone 
hydrochloride),  Plavix  (clopidogrel  bisulfate),  Pantoloc  (pantoprazole),  Crestor  (rosuvastatin  calcium), 
risedronate, and ergocalciferol.  
MAH Comment: The death has been assessed as unlikely related to OCA. Further, the co-morbid diseases 
(peripheral  vascular  disease,  anaemia,  and  cachexia)  were  considered  contributory  to  sepsis,  liver 
failure,  and  death.  Hydromorph  Contin  (hydromorphone  hydrochloride)  and Dilaudid  (hydromorphone 
hydrochloride) were considered co-suspect medications.

A female patient on Ocaliva 5 mg orally weekly for PBC experienced hepatic events of hepatic failure, 
ascites, and blood bilirubin increased. The patient's medical history included PBC, anaemia, cholelithiasis, 
haemolytic  anaemia  with  an  increased  risk  of  gallstones,  cysts  on  her  ovaries,  low  platelets,  eyes 
sometimes get yellow, bladder cysts, and CP score of 11. Approximately 3 months after Ocaliva initiation 
the patient was hospitalized for ascites. She also experienced complications stemming from renal failure. 
The patient died from sepsis related to cirrhosis and liver failure. Ocaliva was continued until the time of 
death.  
MAH Comment: The death has been assessed as unlikely related to OCA. This patient had significantly 
elevated  bilirubin  prior  to  starting  OCA  along  with  confounding  comorbidity  (haemolytic  anaemia  and 
gallstones).  
A  female  patient  was  on  Ocaliva  for  PBC  (dose  of  5  mg,  daily  orally)  with  concomitant  medication 
ursodeoxycholic acid. Approximately 3 years and 8 months after starting Ocaliva the patient died due to 
liver related disorder.  
MAH Comment: The event liver disorder was assessed as possibly related to OCA, in view of plausible 
temporal association, however the underlying condition of PBC confounded the causal assessment.  
A female patient died of liver failure (liver failure), following treatment with Ocaliva 5 mg once daily for 
PBC  (initiated  on  30  Jul  2018).  The  patient’s  concomitant  medication  included  Ursodiol  2  g/day.  The 
patient had been in hospital for about a month and she died on 16 Jan 2023 due to liver failure in the 
hospital.  
MAH Comment: The event hepatic failure was assessed as possibly related to OCA, in view of plausible 
temporal association, however the underlying condition of PBC confounded the causal assessment.  
A female patient of unknown age on Ocaliva 5 mg for PBC experienced the fatal event of progression of 
PBC while awaiting a transplant for an unknown duration after Ocaliva was initiated.  
MAH  Comment:  The  death  has  been  assessed  as  not  related  to  OCA.  However,  limited  information 
regarding drug start date, drug dosing details, event onset date, action taken with OCA, medical history, 
concomitant medications preclude relatedness assessment in this case.  
An  adult  patient  of  unspecified  age  and  sex  with  PBC  experienced  hepatocellular  carcinoma  after  an 
unknown duration of receiving an unknown dose of Ocaliva.  
MAH Comment: The death has been assessed as unlikely related to OCA. Limited information regarding 
drug  start  date,  drug  dosing  details,  event  onset  date,  action  taken  with  OCA,  medical  history,  and 
concomitant medications precludes relatedness assessment in this case.  
A male patient with product used for unknown indication experienced fatal hepatorenal syndrome derived 
from decompensated cirrhosis while on Ocaliva at a dose of 5 mg, daily. On  an unspecified date, the 
patient died due to hepatorenal syndrome derived from decompensated cirrhosis.  
MAH Comment: The death has been assessed as unlikely related to OCA. Limited information regarding 
drug start date, drug dosing details, indication, event onset date, action taken with OCA, medical history, 
concomitant medications preclude relatedness assessment in this case.  
A female patient with PBC was on Ocaliva (5 mg daily) which was decreased to 5 mg once weekly on an 
unknown date due to decompensated cirrhosis. Current conditions included PBC, sulfonamide allergy, 
hepatic cancer, and CP-B. After the initiation of Ocaliva, MELD score increased, and CP score progressed 
to  CP-C.  On  an  unspecified  date,  the  patient  developed  multifocal  hepatocellular  carcinoma 
(hepatocellular  carcinoma)  that  was  deemed  too  advanced  for  treatment.  The  patient  died  due  to 
decompensated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.

MAH  Comment:  The  death  has  been  assessed  as  unlikely  related  to  OCA.  Fatality  in  this  case  is 
confounded by progressive nature of patient’s underlying condition of PBC, with a Child-Pugh score of B 
and hepatic cancer.  
A female patient was receiving Ocaliva (dose of 5 mg) for 6 months for PBC. Ocaliva was titrated to 10 
mg  based  on  liver  function  test  values.  Current  conditions  included  PBC,  CP-A,  cirrhosis  liver,  and 
hypertension.  Patient  had  no  history  of  decompensating  events,  and  good  synthetic  function.  Patient 
was  hospitalised  (on  27  Jan  2020)  due  to  community  acquired  bilateral  pneumonia  and  treated  with 
antibiotics. She died on 05 Feb 2020. Patient's primary cause of death was pneumonia and secondary 
causes  were  heart  failure  (heart  failure),  liver  cirrhosis  (liver  cirrhosis),  and  PBC  (primary  biliary 
cirrhosis).  
MAH Comment: The death has been assessed as not related to OCA. Pneumonia was considered as the 
primary cause of death while secondary causes were heart failure (heart failure), liver cirrhosis (liver 
cirrhosis), and PBC (primary biliary cirrhosis).  
A female patient with PBC experienced gastrointestinal bleeding, liver cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy, 
international  normalized  ratio  increased,  prothrombin  time  increased  and  died  due  to  hepatic 
decompensation  while  on  Ocaliva.  Past  medical  history  included  gallbladder  polyp;  current  conditions 
included  PBC,  CP-B  (score  7),  depression,  hypothyroidism,  diabetes,  vitamin  B12  deficiency,  hepatic 
decompensation,  ascitic  decompensation,  impaired  renal  function,  and  hepatic  cirrhosis.  Procedures 
included liver biopsy and cholecystectomy for vesicular polyp. The patient was on multiple concomitant 
medications.  
MAH  Comment:  The  death  has  been  assessed  as  unlikely  related  to  OCA.  Fatality  in  this  case  is 
confounded by progressive nature of patient’s underlying condition of PBC, with a CP-B classification.  
A  female  patient  on  Ocaliva  (5  mg  once  a  week)  for  PBC  experienced  hepatic  events  blood  bilirubin 
increased, hepatomegaly, hepatic function abnormal, cholestasis, jaundice, ascites, drug-induced liver 
injury, and hepatic failure. Medical history included PBC, probable overlap connective tissue disorder, 
positive antinuclear antibody rheumatoid factor, anti-Ro and anti-RNP with hypergammaglobulinaemia, 
rheumatoid  arthritis,  hypothyroidism,  mixed  connective  tissue  disorder,  eating  disorder  (anorexia), 
bronchiectasis, osteoporosis, alcoholic liver disease, alcohol abuse, ankle swelling, and a designation of 
CP-B (score 7) and a MELD score of 6. The patient was on multiple concomitant medications. The patient 
had an inadequate response to UDCA with a CP Score of B7. The patient began Ocaliva on 28 May 2018 
and stopped Ocaliva when she felt unwell and then restarted it herself. On 10 Oct 2018, Ocaliva was 
discontinued but restarted again on 11 Oct 2018 until Jan 2019 at a dose of 10 mg per week. On 16 Feb 
2019, the patient remained febrile and further developed worsening hypoxia and ongoing fevers that did 
not respond to intravenous antibiotics. High-dose steroid treatment for possible interstitial lung disease, 
respiratory support, and other symptomatic support was considered, however the patient died.  
MAH Comment: The cause of death was considered as bronchopneumonia which was unlikely related to 
OCA.  Further  the  relationship  of  OCA  to  the  events  of  drug-induced  liver  injury,  jaundice,  bilirubin 
increased, and hepatic failure was reported as possibly related based on temporal association, however 
it could be confounded by the underlying condition of PBC with a CP-B classification.  
A female patient on Ocaliva (5 mg orally once weekly) for PBC experienced serious hepatic events of 
ascites, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, blood bilirubin increased, and hepatic failure. Child-Pugh 
classification at the start of Ocaliva was "C" and at start of event was also "C" with score of 12. Medical 
history  included  PBC,  itchiness,  fluid  retention  associated  with  cortisone,  and  an  allergy  to  codeine. 
Concomitant  medications  included  UDCA,  spironolactone,  fluoxetine,  and  Vitamin  D3  (colecalciferol). 
Approximately  6  months  after  Ocaliva  initiation,  the  patient  was  hospitalized.  Additionally,  on  an 
unknown  date  in  2019  she  developed  kidney  stones  and  an  unspecified  infectious  disease. 
EMA/528620/2023

Ursodeoxycholic acid was discontinued on an unspecified date in Oct 2019. The patient was hospitalized 
due to worsening liver disease (hepatic decompensation) on an unknown date in 2019. On 17 Dec 2019, 
the event of “liver disease worsened” was fatal.  
MAH Comment: The worsening of liver disease has been assessed as not related to OCA. Fatality in this 
case is confounded by the progressive nature of patient’s underlying PBC with CP Class C prior to OCA 
initiation.  
A male patient with PBC experienced advanced liver failure and death while receiving Ocaliva (5 mg, an 
unknown  date  in  2017).  Medical  conditions  included  PBC,  portal  hypertension,  ascites,  and  CP-B. 
Concomitant medications taken at the time of the event included spironolactone, UDCA, rifaximin, and 
venlafaxine. At the end of 2018, the patient was added to the transplant list. In Jun 2019, the patient 
developed  advanced  liver  failure  and  Ocaliva  was  discontinued.  On  an  unknown  date,  the  patient 
restarted a new Ocaliva dose of 5 mg, orally, twice a week. On 19 Jun 2019, the patient was admitted 
to the hospital for palliative care. On 25 Nov 2019, the patient died due to advanced liver failure. Ocaliva 
was ongoing at the time of death.  
MAH  Comment:  The  death  has  been  assessed  as  unlikely  related  to  OCA.  Fatality  in  this  case  is 
confounded  by  patient’s  medical  conditions  suggestive  of  progression  of  PBC  (of  Child-Pugh  B  class) 
namely portal hypertension and ascites.  
A female patient with PBC experienced hepatic events: chronic hepatic failure, international normalised 
ratio abnormal, alanine aminotransferase abnormal, aspartate aminotransferase abnormal, and hepatic 
encephalopathy.  Current  conditions  included  primary  biliary  cholangitis,  drug  allergy  (opioids), 
cholestasis,  fatigue,  pulmonary  hypertension,  CREST  syndrome,  arthritis,  iron  deficiency  anaemia, 
chronic obstructive lung disease, hypothyroidism, depression, hypertension, decompensated cirrhosis, 
blood creatinine abnormal, CP-B, portal hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. The patient was on 
multiple concomitant medications. Ocaliva was initiated on 10 Mar 2019 at a dose of 5 mg, once a week 
orally for PBC-related cirrhosis. On 19 Jul 2019, the dose was uptitrated to 5 mg twice weekly orally. In 
2019,  the  patient  experienced  progressive  end-stage  liver  disease  and  mild  hepatic  encephalopathy 
(hepatic encephalopathy) for which patient was treated with lactulose. On 30 Jan 2020, the patient died 
from chronic end stage liver disease secondary to PBC.  
MAH  Comment:  The  death  has  been  assessed  as  unlikely  related  to  OCA.  Fatality  in  this  case  is 
confounded by patient’s multiple medical histories as well as by progressive nature of underlying PBC 
(of Child Pugh class B).  
Among the 20 cases with a fatal outcome, no cases were identified with any strong association between 
the events and OCA. The causal association was unlikely in most of the case reports, possible in 2 and 
not related on 3 case reports. Furthermore, it was identified that in 9 of these cases, the CP classification 
was mentioned as (or score correlated with) CP-B or -C, which is a contraindication for the use of OCA. 
No new relevant safety information was identified.  
Conclusion:  
Based on the quantitative and qualitative analyses, the MAH concluded that the benefit:risk profile of 
OCA remains positive for appropriate patients with PBC. It is further concluded that the implemented 
RMMs, i.e., SmPC updates and distribution of DHPC, appear to be effective.  
The MAH will continue to monitor the effectiveness of the implemented RMMs on a 6-monthly basis. The 
trend  analysis  will  be  performed  on  cumulative  data  and  during  the  period.  Any  significant  negative 
impact/no impact will be submitted along with the PBRER as annexure.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The  MAH  conducted  a  search  in  the  Global  Safety  Database  for  OCA  and  the  post-marketing  data 
captured from the date of approval until 15 May 2023. Out of the cumulative data, the MAH has evaluated 
post-marketing  datasets  from  EU,  United  Kingdom  and  Rest  of  the  World  (excluding  US)  to  identify 
“Hepatic Disorders SMQ (broad), excluding the following sub-SMQs: alcohol related; congenital, familial, 
neonatal, and genetic disorders of the liver; liver infections; and pregnancy-related hepatic disorders.” 
Based  on  the  quantitative  analysis  conducted  considering  sales  data,  the  data  presented  shows  a 
continuous downward trend in the reporting rate of hepatic AEs from 2017 until 2023, including fatal 
cases, although the correlation with relevant RMM milestones is not that obvious as claimed by the MAH. 
However, the decrease in reporting might be explained by a continuous descent of clinical trials as the 
main source of data, such that over the last years spontaneous reporting might be the main (or even 
the only) source of evidence, with the inherent risk of under notification that worsens with prolonged 
time in the market. Furthermore, the low rates of under notification might be particularly aggravated in 
this  case,  given  that  these  hepatic  events  would  be  expected  by  the  progression  of  the  underlying 
condition. Thus, the quantitative data provided, even if somewhat reassuring, do not allow concluding 
that the proposed RMM have been duly implemented and are effective. To this aim, a drug utilisation 
study or other tools that allow collecting data on the actual uses of OCA in clinical practice, not only at 
the  time  of  prescribing  but  in  the  long-term,  such  that  treatment  is  interrupted  once  the  disease 
progress,  would  be  needed  together  with  measures  to  estimate  the  actual  incidence  of  these  hepatic 
events.  
The issue is considered solved. Further discussion on the need for further RMM and proposals to assess 
the  effectiveness  may  be  needed,  but  would  need  to  be  addressed  in  and  appropriate  procedure 
reviewing the B/R of the product.  
Study 747-302 
Question 6 
The MAH should provide the baseline characteristics of the patients excluded from the overall 
safety  analysis  of  Study  747-302,  and  confirm  that  these  patients  fulfil  criteria  for 
contraindication for OCA treatment according to the EU SmPC. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Study 747-302 was carried out as part of one of the two Specific Obligations (SoBs) of the imposed Post-
Authorisation Efficacy Studies (PAES) in the European Union (EU) to confirm the efficacy and safety of 
OCA. Study 747-302 is a confirmatory double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicentre study 
in a predominantly advanced primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) population. Most subjects enrolled into 
Study 747-302 had more advanced disease stage (i.e., higher risk for liver-related clinical complications) 
compared to previous studies and only a subpopulation of subjects is reflective of the current Summary 
of Product Characteristics (SmPC) indicated population. The rationale for this SoB was to confirm the 
clinical benefit of OCA in subjects with PBC by investigating its effect on clinical outcomes (see Figure 
27) below.  
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 200/319 
 
  
 
 
Following update to the United States Prescribing Information (USPI) label in May 2021, patients with 
decompensated  cirrhosis,  or  with  a  prior  decompensation  event,  or  with  compensated  cirrhosis  with 
evidence of portal hypertension at baseline stopped being eligible for enrolment in 747-302 in the US 
only.  The  EU  SmPC  was  updated  accordingly  only  in  June  2022  (i.e.,  7  months  after  the  study  was 
terminated on 03 Nov 2021). For this reason, it did not affect the EU subjects eligible for enrolment in 
the study.  
Notwithstanding the change in the inclusion/exclusion criteria, per the pre-specified statistical analysis 
plan  (SAP),  the  safety  population  included  all  334  randomized  subjects  who  receive  any  amount  of 
investigational  product  (OCA  or  placebo).  The  safety  population  was  the  primary  population  used  for 
safety analyses and treatment assignment was based on the treatment received. Given the USPI label 
changes in May 2021, the 747-302 SAP also prespecified subgroup analyses based on baseline disease 
stage severity (Figure 28, Table 47). The first subgroup category was based on baseline cirrhosis status, 
which is reflective of the current SmPC. An additional subgroup category was also analysed, which is 
more restrictive and excludes patients with clinical evidence of portal hypertension. This latter baseline 
subgroup  category  is  reflective  of  the  proposed  SmPC  labelling.  Both  subgroup  categories  include  all 
subjects in the Study 747-302 intent-to-treat (ITT) and safety populations (both N=334).  
21%  of  subjects  who  entered  into  Study  747-302  had  decompensated  cirrhosis  or  had  a  prior 
decompensation  event  at  baseline  and  thus  met  the  criteria  of  contraindicated  per  current  SmPC.  In 
contrast,  55%  of  subjects  who  entered  into  Study  747-302  met  the  criteria  for  the  proposed  SmPC 
contraindicated population, which is more restrictive and excludes all subjects with clinical evidence of 
portal hypertension.

Study 747-302 Baseline Characteristics  
Baseline characteristics for subjects by baseline disease severity based on the current SmPC, as well as 
the  MAH’s  proposed  SmPC  are  summarized  in  Table  48.  As  noted  in  Major  Objection  1,  the  747-302 
subject  population  is  not  reflective  of  the  current  and  proposed  SmPC.  747-302  included  a  more 
advanced liver disease population.  
Subjects recruited into Study 747-301 were more representative of the patients treated in real-world 
clinical practice.  
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 202/319 
 
  
 
 
 
 
As shown in Table 49, the 747-302 cohort had higher ALP values at baseline, than the 747-301 population 
and European cohorts (Median (U/L) [IQR]: 244.0 [204.0, 361.0] in Spain, 259.0 [203.0, 391.0] in Italy 
and 343.4 [250.7, 469.4] in the UK PBC). 
EMA/528620/2023

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The  Company  has  presented  the  information  requested.  These  data  confirm  that  747-302  included  a 
more advanced liver disease population, based on Rotterdam criteria of severity, Child-Pugh Class, MELD 
Score, baseline ALP, GGT, creatinine, INR, platelets, albumin, and total BR values at baseline, than that 
included in Study 747-301. Given the differences in the restrictions applied in the SmPC between US and 
EU,  in  addition  to  the  overall  safety  analysis  based  on  the  safety  population  that  included  all  334 
randomized subjects who receive any amount of investigational product (OCA or placebo), which was 
the primary population used for safety analyses, the 747-302 SAP also prespecified subgroup analyses 
based on baseline disease stage of severity. The first subgroup category was based on baseline cirrhosis 
status, which is reflective of the current SmPC (this excluded 21% of subjects who entered into Study 
747-302  but  had  decompensated  cirrhosis or  had  a  prior  decompensation  event  at  baseline  and thus 
met  the  criteria  of  contraindicated  per  current  EU  SmPC).  An  additional  subgroup  category  was  also 
analysed, which is more restrictive and excludes patients with clinical evidence of portal hypertension. 
This latter baseline subgroup category was not pre-specified and reflects the newly proposed restricted 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 204/319 
 
  
 
 
 
 
indication that excludes 55% of subjects who entered Study 747-302. Whether this truly represent a 
portion of the PBC population where a favourable benefit/risk balance can be concluded with certainty is 
a matter of assessment within an appropriate procedure.  
This issue is considered clarified.  
Question 7 
Secondary endpoint analyses show that only a total of 21 (6.3%) of patients enrolled in Study 
747-302 met the primary endpoint as defined in the pivotal Phase 3 Study 747-301 of an ALP 
<1.67x  ULN  and  total  bilirubin  ≤ULN  and  ALP  decrease  from  baseline of ≥15%.  Indeed,  the 
rate of responders was substantially lower compared to that previously reported and this was 
the case in both treatment arms, but rather noticeable in the OCA treated group (OCA 10.1% 
vs  2.4%  placebo  in  Study  747-302  vs  OCA  34.0%  vs  7%  placebo  in  Study  747-301).  No 
statistically  significant  differences  were  reported,  adding  even  further  uncertainties  to  the 
actual efficacy of OCA in the treatment of PBC. The MAH should present a detailed description 
of  changes  in  relevant  liver  biochemical  parameters  and  explain  the  observed  differences, 
considering  that  Study  747-302  included  a  more  advanced  liver  disease  population  likely 
representative of the actual target in clinical practice.  
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Subjects recruited into Study 747-301 had milder disease at an earlier stage and are representative of 
patients with PBC currently treated in routine clinical practice. Study 747-302 recruited subjects with 
more advanced disease to enhance accrual of clinical events. This is supportive by significant differences 
in baseline disease characteristics, the magnitude of change required to achieve biochemical thresholds 
of the primary response criteria in Study 747-301, the time course of ALP and total bilirubin, and real-
world clinical practice patient characteristics.  
As  shown  in  Figure  4  and  Figure  5,  median  baseline  ALP  and  total  bilirubin  values  were  substantially 
higher in Study 747-302 versus 747-301. Figure 4 also shows that the percent reduction from baseline 
required to achieve the target ALP (≤1.67x ULN) or total bilirubin (<ULN) thresholds from the primary 
response criteria of Study 747-301 were significantly different between studies. 
Despite  differences  in  baseline  ALP  and  total  bilirubin,  clinically  meaningful  improvements  in  ALP  and 
total bilirubin were observed in the OCA group compared to the placebo group in both studies (Figure 
5). The magnitude of improvements in ALP were consistent for the OCA group for both studies, while a 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 205/319 
 
  
 
 
 
greater reduction in total bilirubin was observed for the OCA group in Study 747-302 compared to Study 
747-301 (Table 1). 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 206/319 
 
  
 
 
 
 
As shown in Table 2 patient characteristics from European PBC and OCA registries provide supportive 
evidence  that  the  Study  747-301  subject  population  is  more  representative  of  the  patient  population 
treated with Ocaliva in real-world clinical practice than the Study 747-302 population. The median ALP 
levels of patients initiating Ocaliva in cohorts from Spain, Italy and the UK are similar to or lower than 
baseline ALP levels in Study 747-301. 
Biochemical Response Predicts Clinical Outcomes  
Because of the high rate of treatment cross-over in Study 747-302, an analysis of biochemical response 
and  correlation  with  clinical  outcomes  was  conducted,  independent  of  initial  randomization  status.  As 
shown Table 3, irrespective of treatment group, there was an association between biochemical response 
(based on the Study 747-301 primary endpoint) and improved clinical outcomes (based on the Study 
747-302  primary  outcomes  endpoint).  This  demonstrates  that  changes  in  biochemistries,  specifically 
reductions in abnormal values of ALP and total bilirubin, which are known to reflect ongoing damage in 
progressive cholestatic disease, are predictive of improved clinical outcomes. The HR of 0.23 indicates a 
substantial  reduction  in  the  risk  of  liver  transplant  or  death  in  subjects  who  achieve  the  biochemical 
response as initially described in Study 747-301. 
As  shown  in  Table  50,  this  outcome  benefit  was  observed  across  various  established  biochemical 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 207/319 
 
  
 
 
 
 
responder criteria. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
In response to this question, the MAH argues that the actual target population in clinical practice is 
more like that included in Study 747-301, based on the comparison of baseline disease characteristics 
of subjects from European PBC and OCA registries, and much less severe than that included in Study 
747-302; this is agreed based on the data presented, but it is not known if these data truly represents 
the actual treated population in clinical practice or rather a selected subset of patients within those 
actually treated.  
It is also argued that subjects with higher values at baseline, representative of a more severe 
condition, might unlikely reach normal (or near normal) biochemical ALP/BR values, and that similar 
absolute changes in ALP values are expected. However, the actual meaning of the observed 
quantitative reductions of ALP/BR values, in the absence of concurrent changes in histological 
progression, is highly uncertain and of doubtful clinical relevance. Indeed, the predictive value of the 
changes in biochemical parameters with respect to relevant clinical outcomes in PBC has not been 
established definitively. Available literature appears to indicate that for UDCA, ALP reductions to 
normal (or near normal) values might be associated to lower liver outcomes. But available evidence 
shows contradictory findings.  
The analyses conducted by the MAH aimed to correlate biochemical responses with clinical outcomes in 
Study 747-302, cannot be taken as demonstrative of a correlation as this should be formally 
demonstrated by the outside evidence.   
In conclusion, OCA treatment has demonstrated to reduce ALP (and BR) levels, though the effect is of 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 208/319 
 
  
 
 
 
 
modest magnitude and the actual clinical meaning is uncertain. The confirmatory trial has failed to 
demonstrate the benefit of OCA treatment in clinical outcomes.  
Issue solved, given that the requested information has been provided. The efficacy of OCA 
treatment is further discussed under MO1.  
Question 8 
The  MAH  justifies  the  need  for  the  EC  group  by  stating  that  the  validity  of  ITT  analyses 
depends  on  successfully  balancing  randomisation  and  maintaining  treatment  and  placebo 
allocation throughout the trial. Additional arguments are based on the claim that the reported 
results  in  Study  747-302  were  underpowered  and  potentially  biased  for  a  list  of  reasons 
discussed below. These arguments cannot be accepted. Overall, the observed differences in 
the  estimation  of  the  treatment  effect  for  the  primary  endpoint  using  the  primary 
randomisation  and  the  IPCW,  demonstrate  the  high  risk  of  bias  associated  to  the  reported 
analyses based on the weighting procedure, as compared to the results of Study 747-302. All 
results  based  on  the  EC  are  considered  to  have  the  same  problem  of  bias.  Furthermore,  in 
addition to all the issues discussed above, the analyses resulting from the comparisons with 
EC should be understood in the context of a pivotal trial in which the primary analysis failed, 
leaving  no  alpha  for  confirmatory  testing.  As  a  result,  any  further  analyses  should  be 
considered exploratory only. The MAH is invited to further justify the validity of these analyses 
considering the CHMP arguments.  
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Study 747-302 Primary Endpoint Definitions  
Two separate primary objectives were analyzed in Study 747-302 based on discussions with the FDA 
and EMA regarding the feasibility of assessing the long-term efficacy in subjects in Study 747-302. The 
EMA requested that the Sponsor retain the original primary composite endpoint as defined in Table 51, 
while the FDA, following the May 2021 USPI update, agreed to an expanded primary composite endpoint 
as defined Table 52. 
This endpoint is considered primary for the EMA and as a secondary endpoint for FDA.  
To support the primary objective, based on recommendation from the FDA, the primary efficacy endpoint 
was  expanded  beyond  what  was  outlined  in  Protocol  Version  6.  The  primary  objective  based  on  this 
expanded endpoint was to compare the effect of OCA to placebo, in conjunction with established local 
standard of care, on clinical outcomes in subjects with PBC as measured by time to first occurrence of 
the following adjudicated events, derived as an expanded composite event endpoint (including all Group 
1 to Group 3 events described in Table 52. This efficacy endpoint is referred to as primary for the FDA 
and secondary for the EMA. 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 209/319 
 
  
 
 
 
The  Committee  for  Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use  (CHMP)  raises  an  important  point,  which  itself 
highlights the bias in Study 747-302.  
CHMP  appears  to  be  referencing  Table  30  from  the 747-302  clinical  study  report  (CSR)  (as  shown  in 
Table 53). For the primary composite endpoint in Protocol Version 6, there were 48 events in the OCA-
treated group and 48 events in the placebo group. The primary analysis produced a hazard ratio of 1.01 
(95% CI 0.68, 1.51). When inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW) was applied, the hazard 
ratio decreased to 0.82 (95% CI 0.53, 1.27). 
It is important to note that the number of subjects (N=334) and number of Protocol Version 6 endpoint 
events  (48  in each  treatment  arm)  leave  the  analysis  of  the  Protocol  Version  6  endpoint  significantly 
under-powered. As shown in Figure 29, recruitment was on track to enrol 428 subjects (dashed brown 
line) until Ocaliva received approval and became commercially available in the United States (US) and 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 210/319 
 
  
 
 
 
 
European  Union  (EU).  At  that  point,  recruitment  slowed  dramatically  (solid  green  line),  while 
investigational  product  discontinuation  (solid  blue  line)  and  study  discontinuation  (solid  red  line) 
accelerated.  In  2019,  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  discussed  recruitment/retention 
concerns  with  CHMP  and agreed to initiate  study  sites  in  additional  countries.  With the  advent  of the 
COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, healthcare restrictions made such site initiation impossible. At the 
time the MAH, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and European Medicines Agency (EMA) agreed 
to  stop  the  study  for  lack  of  feasibility  in  2021,  only  334  subjects  were  enrolled  (78%  of  the  target 
number of subjects) and 96 of the targeted 127 adjudicated endpoints (76%) were observed. Assuming 
a true hazard ratio (HR) of 0.8, which would match the IPCW HR point estimate as well as the expanded 
endpoint point estimate, the analysis of the EMA endpoint was significantly underpowered (1-β=0.192). 
As such, the HR point estimate is inherently unstable, with a wide confidence interval. The HRs of the 
unweighted  and  IPCW  analyses  are  well  within  each  other’s  95%  CIs  and  cannot  be  viewed  as 
meaningfully different. 
With 151 events, the expanded (FDA) endpoint analysis is also underpowered assuming an HR of 0.8 
(1-β=0.28). Here the unweighted and IPCW hazard ratios are very similar, and very similar to the IPCW 
Protocol  Version  6  endpoint  analysis,  though  here  again  all  95%  CIs  are  widely  overlapping.  Taken 
together, the outlier HR in these analyses is the unadjusted Protocol Version 6 endpoint analysis, which 
CHMP correctly points out is compelling evidence of the censoring bias in that analysis.  
The  post  hoc  analyses  performed  by  the  MAH  go  further,  demonstrating  that  the  censoring  was  not 
random  but  was  informative,  pointing  to  functional  unblinding  and  the  use  of  rescue  therapy  in  the 
placebo group.  
The key sources of bias in the primary 747-302 study are as follows:  
• Subjects in the placebo group with high ALP levels discontinued placebo (Figure 1)  
•  Subjects  in  the  placebo  group  disproportionately  initiated  commercial  PBC  treatments  (i.e.,  OCA, 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 211/319 
 
  
 
 
 
fibrates, or UDCA if not on UDCA at baseline, Figure 2)  
• 
Subjects in the placebo group who initiated commercial PBC treatments showed large decreases 
in ALP (Figure 3)  
Taken together, placebo subjects with more severe disease (based on high ALP levels) either dropped 
out of the study or discontinued placebo in favour of commercial PBC treatments, which substantially 
lowered ALP levels. Supporting this observation, the MAH was told directly by several Investigators that 
they  felt  it  was  unethical  to  maintain  patients  with  high  ALP  levels  on  study  drug  when  effective 
commercial treatment was available. Lower ALP has been shown to be associated with fewer deaths and 
liver  transplants  (Lammers  2014,  Carbone  2013).  Thus,  the  event  rates  in  the  placebo  group  do  not 
reflect non-treatment. The positive effects of informative censoring and active treatment meaningfully 
reduced ALP levels, and thus reduced the number of clinical events in the placebo group. These effects 
were not observed to the same degree in the OCA-treated group.   
• 
Among  subjects  randomized  to  OCA  treatment,  65%  of  events  occurred  in  patients  who 
discontinued OCA a median of 9 months prior to an event.  
The MAH believes that the events rates in the OCA-treated group do not fully reflect the clinical benefits 
of  OCA  treatment.  The  majority  of  events  in  the  OCA-treated  group  happened  in  patients  who 
discontinued investigational product, and for a sufficiently long period that treatment benefit would no 
longer be observed.  
The substantial treatment crossover in both placebo- and OCA-treated groups are not accounted for in 
the ITT analyses, which maintains subjects in the group to which they were randomized, not allowing 
for reassignment based upon actual treatment. As CHMP correctly points out, the IPCW analysis begins 
to  account  for  this,  and  changes  the  HR  from  indicating  no  benefit  (HR=1.01)  to  moderate  benefit 
(HR=0.82).  
A detailed review of each of these analyses is provided below.  
Figure 1 shows the mean ALP levels of the placebo-treated subjects who continued placebo treatment 
(solid red line and circles). PBC is a slowly progressive disease marked by rising ALP levels over time. 
The steady decrease in ALP in placebo subjects is counter to the natural history of disease and was not 
observed in the Phase 2 double-blind 3-month studies evaluating OCA in PBC (Hirshfield 2015, Kowdley 
2018)  and  the  12-month  double-blind  phase  of  Study  747-301  (Nevens  2016)  nor  in  other  placebo-
controlled,  double-blind  studies  in  PBC  including  a  24-month  study  of  bezafibrate  in  addition  to 
ursodeoxycholic acid (Corpechot 2018) and a 3-months study of seledapar (Jones 2017). As shown in 
the red open circles and dashed lines, the patients who discontinued placebo had substantially higher 
ALP levels than those who continued investigational product. As those patients either dropped out of the 
study all together or initiated commercial PBC treatments (see Figure 1), the decrease in ALP levels in 
the  placebo  group  reflect  both  informative  censoring  and  the  effects  of  active  treatment,  not  a  true 
placebo ALP. This predominantly occurred in the first 2 years after randomization, in which 87 placebo 
subjects with high mean ALP levels discontinued placebo.  
In  the  OCA-treated  group,  the  ALP  levels  of  subjects  who  discontinued  investigational  product  were 
generally  similar  to  those  who  stayed  on  investigational  product.  Only  the  group  of  21  subjects  who 
discontinued OCA in Months 12 to 18 had substantially higher mean ALP levels than those that stayed 
on investigational product. 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 212/319 
 
  
 
 
Figure  2  examines  investigational  product  discontinuation  in  the  context  of  initiating  commercial  PBC 
therapies  over  time  by  treatment  group.  The  solid  lines  show  the  proportion  of  subjects  initiating 
commercial PBC treatments (OCA, fibrates, or UDCA if not taking UDCA at baseline) in the placebo arm 
(red line) and OCA-treated arm (blue line). This is overlaid on a bar graph showing absolute number of 
patients in the placebo- (pink bars) and OCA-treated (light blue bars) arms discontinuing study drug. 
In  the  OCA-treated  arm,  peak  discontinuation  happened  in  the  first  6  months  (n=25,  14.8%)  and 
declined  afterwards.  The primary  reason  for  discontinuation through  Month  6 was  pruritus  (10 of  25, 
40%  for  OCA-treated  versus  none  in  placebo).  There  was  minimal  initiation  of  non-investigational 
product  therapies  in  the  first  6  months  for  either  group.  For  OCA-treated  subjects,  initiation  of 
commercial treatments was generally linear from baseline to Month 60. 
In  the  placebo  group,  discontinuation  of  investigational  product  increased  from  baseline  and  peaked 
between Months 12 and 24. The rise in subjects initiating commercial treatment closely mirrors the rise 
in  discontinuations, 
thus  as  placebo  subjects  discontinued 
investigational  product, 
they 
disproportionately  initiated  commercial  therapies.  As  discussed  above,  subjects  discontinuing  placebo 
had higher ALP levels. Over the entire study period, placebo subjects were significantly more likely to 
initiate non-investigational product therapy compared to OCA-treated subjects (HR 1.59; 95% CI 1.02 
to 2.50; p<0.05). 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 213/319 
 
  
 
 
 
Figure 3 shows the impact of initiation of commercially available PBC therapies on mean ALP. The two 
cohorts of subjects had similar mean baseline ALP values (493 U/L, placebo; 481 U/L OCA). However, 
before initiating commercial therapies, the mean ALP in the placebo group was 590 U/L (red line) versus 
347  U/L  in  the  OCA-treat  group  (blue  line).  These  substantial  differences  strongly  suggest  functional 
unblinding  in  the  placebo  group.  Significant  subject  and  provider  education  regarding  the  strong 
correlation of persistent high levels of ALP with increased risk of negative clinical outcomes, including 
progression  to  liver  transplant  and  death,  made  conduct  of  a  fully  blinded  clinical  study  unfeasible. 
Investigators were not prevented from reviewing real-time ALP values for their subjects, nor from sharing 
those values and the implications for disease progression with their patients. 
In the first 3 months after initiating commercial treatments, placebo subjects had a mean ALP of 484 
U/L  compared  to  a  mean ALP  of  590  U/L  in  the  3  months  prior  to  initiating commercial  treatment,  a 
difference of 106.3 U/L. Subjects in the OCA-treated group who initiated commercial therapies had a 
mean ALP of 280 U/L in the 3 months after initiating commercial treatment compared to a mean ALP of 
347 U/L in the 3 months prior to initiating commercial treatment, a difference of 67.5 U/L. Commercial 
PBC  therapies  were  effective  in  reducing  ALP  in  both  groups  during  the  first  36  months  following 
randomization. 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 214/319 
 
  
 
 
 
In  summary,  there  was  significant  crossover  of  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  to  commercial  PBC 
treatments,  leading  to  substantial  ALP  improvement.  This  was  driven,  in  part,  by  higher  ALP  levels, 
suggesting functional unblinding occurred. Given the known association between reduction in ALP and 
improved  outcomes  (Lammers  2014,  Carbone  2013),  this  significantly  reduced  clinical  events  in  the 
placebo group. 
The  discontinuation  of  investigational  product  in  patients  with  high  ALP,  and  initiation  of  commercial 
treatments, was not observed in the OCA treatment group to the same degree and did not occur early 
in treatment. In addition, the OCA-treated group also showed significant treatment crossover: 65% of 
endpoint events occurred in subjects who had discontinued OCA, a median of 9 months before the event 
occurred. This resulted in an increase in clinical events in the OCA-treated group. 
This degree of bias cannot be overcome, and the primary ITT analyses of the Protocol Version 6 endpoint 
cannot be considered valid, though IPCW can mitigate that bias to a degree. 
CHMP then validly asks: if the primary study is biased in a way that cannot be mitigated analytically, 
can an external control adequately address these issues? 
First,  the  informative  discontinuation  of  investigational  product  and  crossover  to  commercial  PBC 
treatments disproportionately affected the placebo group. The primary issue for the OCA-treated group 
was  discontinuation  of  treatment  before  an  event.  By  taking  an  as-treated  approach  to  the  external 
control  analyses,  patients  in  the  non-OCA-treated  control  group  are  censored  when  they  discontinue 
investigational product and/or start rescue therapy, and the patients OCA-treated group are censored 
90 days after discontinuation of OCA (the period an expert panel of hepatologists advised would be the 
maximal extension of treatment benefit after discontinuation). Thus, the HRs reflect the effect of actual 
treatment versus non-treatment on outcomes. 
Table  54  shows  unweighted  and  weighted  sample  sizes,  events,  and  hazard  ratios  (95%  CIs)  for  the 
external  control  analyses  of  the  747-302  study.  Here,  we  see  the  effect  of  weighting  (in  this  case 
standardized  morbidity  ratios)  on  the hazard  ratios  is  negligible.  In part,  this is  because the  external 
control  balance  took  place  in  2  phases.  In  the  first  phase,  subjects  were  selected  who  met  747-302 
eligibility criteria (modified to accommodate data availability, e.g., excluding MELD score), and thus were 
similar  before  weighting.  Second,  propensity  scores  and  standardized  morbidity  ratio  weights  were 
applied. The samples were well balanced at baseline. The consistency of the weighted and unweighted 
effect  size  estimates  should  help  mitigate  CHMP  concerns  regarding  the  effects  of  weighting  on  the 
EMA/528620/2023

results. 
In summary, the MAH agrees with CHMP that the differences between the unweighted and IPCW analysis 
of the primary EMA endpoint, while they fall well within each other’s 95% CIs, suggest bias in the primary 
study. Importantly, in 2021 FDA strongly recommended that the primary endpoint for Study 747-302 
be  expanded  while  the  study  remained  ongoing  in  an  effort  to  increase  study  power.  Analysis  of  the 
more adequately powered expanded (FDA) endpoint demonstrated an HR that was consistent with the 
IPCW analysis. 
Post hoc analyses revealed that the censoring was not random but informative as detected by the IPCW. 
Patients in the placebo group with higher ALP levels discontinued study drug, with the majority either 
discontinuing  the  study  all  together  or  disproportionately  initiating  commercial  PBC  treatments.  As  a 
result, the ALP levels in the placebo group improved, lowering event rates in this group. OCA-treated 
patients  discontinued  therapy  sufficiently  before  events  that  those  events  do  not  reflect  the  effect  of 
treatment, i.e., events were increased in the OCA-treated group. 
The  external  control  as-treated  analyses  addressed  these  issues  by  censoring  control  patients  who 
initiated commercial PBC treatments, and censoring OCA-treated patients 90-days after discontinuing 
treatment. Groups were well balanced before and after the application of SMR weights, and results of 
unweighted and weighted analyses showed very similar and clinically meaningful reduction in events. 
The MAH believes this should mitigate some of the concerns CHMP expressed regarding the application 
of weights in these analyses. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH argues that there was a high rate of study treatment discontinuation in both treatment arms 
with cross-over to treatment options available during the conduct of the pivotal study, and that this 
happened in a different degree in both treatment arms and at a different time during the trial; being 
due to lack of efficacy in ALP reductions in the placebo arm, that were subsequently crossed over to 
receive an effective treatment, which might have reduced the incidence of clinical events in placebo. 
The actual rates and timing of treatment discontinuations, the reasons behind and the treatments 
received after stopping study treatment, have not been clearly detailed for any treated groups; in fact, 
in some cases is difficult to disentangle the results from the double-bling and the extension phases. In 
fact, the overall number (%) of placebo and OCA patients who (a) discontinued treatment was 51 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 216/319 
 
  
 
 
 
(30.7%) and 65 (38.7%), (b) discontinued study visits was 61 (36.7%) and 72 (42.9%), and (c) 
discontinued the study was 83 (50%) and 88 (52.4%); notably, these figures do not suggest an 
overall higher rate in the placebo group, but quite the opposite. This is an important piece of 
information because there are not too many effective treatments available for patients with PBC who 
do not respond to UDCA, and if the Applicant is suggesting a potential effect of these treatments, this 
may have affected both arms. Furthermore, if this happened truly during the conduct of the study, it is 
simply not possible to estimate with fair the actual rate of events during treatment with either placebo 
or OCA. Because of this bias in the estimation, neither of the analyses conducted (pre-planned or post-
hoc) are valid to reach conclusions. In essence, the primary analysis was clearly negative (HR 
[95%CI]: 1.01 [0.68, 1.51]) under a strategy for dealing with intercurrent events that closely 
resembles the treatment policy strategy, which more closely resembles the expected treatment effect 
under pragmatic conditions in clinical practice. These results are not only inconsistent with the 
expected HR in the pre-specified sample size (i.e. HR of 0.60), but also with a smaller but still relevant 
effect in the studied trial population. 
In addition, even if the estimation of the OCA treatment effect were deemed a valid one, the post-hoc 
external cohort comparison to rescue a failed primary analysis of the trial is not considered reliable and 
acceptable to reach conclusions given the anticipated difficulties in ensuring the due comparability in 
this condition, which cannot be sorted out by simply applying the CT inclusion/exclusion criteria + the 
IPDW analysis.  
This issue is not considered solved. 
Question 9 
A  high  proportion  of subjects  in  both  treatment  groups  required  dose adjustments  at  least 
once, dose interruptions/discontinuations, but this information is only presented for CP-B or 
CP-C patients at any time during the study. The MAH is invited to provide this information of 
the  overall  safety  population,  and  for  both  the  subset  of  compensated  vs  decompensated 
patients at baseline.  
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Study 747-302 was initiated prior to approval of obeticholic acid (OCA). Dosing regimen for all subjects 
in the initial protocol was OCA 5 mg once daily with titration to OCA 10 mg once daily at 6 months, if 
tolerated.  Based  on  data  from  Study  747-301,  the  initial  approved  dosing  regimens  for  OCA  for  the 
treatment of subjects with PBC were 5 mg and 10 mg once daily for non-cirrhotic and Child-Pugh (CP) 
Class A cirrhosis subjects. Considering the risk for liver-related adverse reactions in subjects with higher 
OCA hepatic exposure, the initial labelling recommended a modified, lower dosing frequency (once or 
twice weekly) for advanced PBC subjects (e.g., moderate to severe hepatic impairment). 
Following  approval  of  OCA,  the  747-302  protocol  (Version  3)  was  amended  and  dosing  adjustments 
(dose,  frequency,  titration,  titration  criteria)  were  made  based  on  cirrhosis  status  and  CP  scoring  as 
described in Table 55: 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 217/319 
 
  
 
 
A  summary  of  dosing  is  provided  in  Table  56  for  the  overall  safety  population  and  by  the  following 
baseline stages: decompensated (contraindicated per the current SmPC), compensated (indicated per 
the  current  SmPC),  proposed  SmPC  indicated  population  (i.e.,  subjects  who  had  not  experienced 
evidence  of  portal  hypertension  or  decompensation  at  baseline),  and  proposed  SmPC  contraindicated 
population (i.e., subjects who had experienced portal hypertension and/or decompensation at baseline).  
•  Across  all  populations  and  treatment  groups,  a  similar  proportion  of  subjects  in  both  treatment 
groups  (87.3%  of  placebo  subjects  to  81.5%  of  OCA  subjects)  had  any  dose  change.  This  high 
percentage is not unexpected given the protocol-specified dosing titration regimen (Table 55)  
•  Across treatment groups, a similar proportion of subjects (34.3% of placebo subjects to 36.9% of 
OCA  subjects)  had  any  drug  holiday.  However,  higher  proportion  of  OCA-treated  subjects  with 
hepatic decompensation, now contraindicated in the SmPC, had a drug holiday (56.3%) compared 
to  placebo-treated  subjects  (32.4%).  The  MAH  acknowledges  this  difference,  and  believes  this 
difference further supports the decision to exclude these patients from OCA treatment.  
•  More  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  discontinued  product  >30  days  prior  to  an  event  than  OCA-
treated patients in both the compensated subgroup (55.8% vs 44.1%) and proposed SmPC subgroup 
(57.4%  vs  44.4%).  The  issue  of  functional  unblinding  and  informative  discontinuation  of  placebo 
based on high ALP levels was discussed extensively in Major Objection 1 and is further reflected in 
these data.  
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 218/319 
 
  
 
 
 
 
The MAH has presented the requested information, and data raises no concerns. The high proportion of 
patients  that  required  dose  changes  can  be  explained  by  the  implementation  of  the  approved  SmPC 
posology at the time of MA in the ongoing clinical trial 747-302. These changes affected both subjects 
non-cirrhotic/CPA  and  subjects  with  CP  B/C,  which  explains  the  high  and  comparable  results  across 
subpopulations. No relevant differences were observed in the proportion of patients requiring any drug 
holidays, but the actual number of drug holidays required in each treatment group has not been provided, 
what would be an interesting piece of information to know about the actual tolerability of treatment. This 
should be provided (OC). The only exception, where a higher proportion of any drug-holiday was noted, 
was  in  OCA-treated  subjects  with  hepatic  decompensation  (56.3%  OCA  vs  32.4%  placebo).  These 
subjects are now contraindicated in the SmPC.  
Issue partially solved, but not further pursued within this procedure. The the actual number of 
drug holidays (mean, SD, and if needed, by category, e.g., <1 vs ≥2) in each treatment group was not 
clarified by the MAH. 
Question 10 
The MAH is invited to provide tabulated results of the overall safety profile of OCA in the total 
safety  population  and  in  the  two  subsets  of  patients  compensated  and  decompensated,  to 
better illustrate any existing differences in the safety profile of these patients.  
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Safety Profile of OCA 
The Marketing Authorization Holder (MAH) assessed the frequency of events between obeticholic acid 
(OCA)  and  placebo  in  the  overall,  compensated  (indicated  per  current  summaries  of  product 
characteristics [SmPC]), and decompensated (contraindicated per current SmPC) populations in Study 
747-302.  Given  the  subjects  in  these  various  groups  have  more  advanced  primary  biliary  cholangitis 
(PBC) disease, and that, as presented in the Type II Variation Serial 0066 submitted 01 July 2021, it will 
not be feasible to establish the safety and efficacy of Ocaliva in patients with more advanced PBC. The 
MAH has explored a more appropriate population that maximizes the benefit:risk profile. Therefore, the 
MAH has now proposed a revised SmPC indication for subjects without cirrhosis or compensated cirrhosis 
who do not have clinical evidence of portal hypertension or decompensation at baseline. 
Treatment  with  OCA  was  generally  well  tolerated  in  patients  with  PBC  who  met  the  criteria  of  the 
proposed SmPC at baseline, and the overall safety profile was consistent with that observed in other PBC 
studies  that  excluded  patients  with  more  severe  disease.  The  incidence  of  most  treatment-emergent 
adverse events of special interest (TEAESIs) observed in OCA-treated subjects was markedly lower in 
the proposed SmPC indicated population compared to the overall safety population. 
The  safety  results  from  Study  747-302  are  presented  for  the  overall  safety  population  and  by  the 
following baseline disease stages: decompensated (contraindicated per the current SmPC), compensated 
(indicated  per  the  current  SmPC),  proposed  SmPC  indicated  (i.e.,  subjects  who  had  not  experienced 
portal  hypertension  [PH]  or  decompensation  at  baseline),  and  proposed  SmPC  contraindicated  (i.e., 
subjects who had experienced PH and/or decompensation at baseline). The presented populations by 
baseline disease stage are summarized in Figure 30.

Study 747-302 Design and Statistical Considerations  
Study  747-302  was  not  designed  or  intended  to  determine  the  benefit:risk  in  the  subpopulations  of 
compensated  (indicated  per  current  SmPC),  decompensated  (contraindicated  per  current  SmPC), 
proposed SmPC indicated, and proposed SmPC contraindicated. The analysis populations were grouped 
and programmed retrospectively using baseline data based on the disease stage definitions in Table 57. 
Programmatic implementation may have been limited depending on the availability of the baseline data.  
Subjects in the compensated (indicated per current SmPC) or proposed SmPC indicated populations may 
have progressed and met contraindicated criteria after baseline and during conduct of the study. These 
subjects may have remained on investigational product.  
In  addition,  the  interpretation  of  event  rates  in  Study  747-302  may  be  of  limited  value  due  to  the 
differential dropout observed between the treatment groups, with more subjects in the placebo group 
initiating  commercially-available  PBC  therapy  (i.e.,  commercial  Ocaliva,  fibrates,  or  UDCA)  while  on 
study.  Therefore,  the  MAH  assessment  focuses  primarily  on  the  event  rate  differences  between  the 
various baseline disease stage OCA treatment groups and provides placebo treatment group event rates 
for completeness.

Overview of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events in Study 747-302  
An overview of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) by overall, decompensated (contraindicated 
per current SmPC), compensated (indicated per current SmPC), proposed SmPC indicated, and proposed 
SmPC contraindicated populations is presented in Table 58.  
Proposed SmPC Indicated Population  
In comparison to the overall and compensated (indicated per current SmPC) populations, the proportion 
of serious TEAEs across treatment groups was lower in the proposed SmPC indicated population.  
In the proposed SmPC indicated population (N=149), a total of 15 (18.5%) subjects in the OCA group 
and 17 (25.0%) subjects in the placebo group experienced a serious TEAE. Of which, 1 (1.2%) subject 
in the OCA group reported a TEAE of acute respiratory failure leading to death, which was considered 
not related to investigational product by the Investigator (Section 2.8.3.1).  
The incidence of any TEAEs was balanced across treatment groups (93.8% in the OCA group and 89.7% 
in the placebo group). Consistent with the overall and compensated populations, more subjects in the 
OCA group than the placebo group experienced severe TEAEs (45.7% versus 32.4%), treatment-related 
TEAEs (75.3% versus 55.9%), and TEAEs leading to dose reduction (24.7% versus 10.3%), which were 
mostly driven by pruritus. Pruritus is a known adverse drug reaction (ADR) per the current SmPC and 
was  an  adverse  event  of  special  interest  (AESI)  in  Study  747-302.  Pruritus  is  discussed  in  Section 
2.8.3.4.6.

Analysis of Adverse Events  
Adverse Events by Incidence  
A  summary  of  TEAEs  occurring  in  ≥5%  of  overall  OCA-treated  subjects  by  overall,  decompensated 
(contraindicated  per  current  SmPC),  compensated  (indicated  per  current  SmPC),  the  proposed  SmPC 
indicated, and proposed SmPC contraindicated populations is presented in Table 59.  
Proposed SmPC Indicated Population  
In  comparison  to  the  overall  and  compensated  populations,  individual  TEAEs  occurred  less  frequently 
across treatment groups in the proposed SmPC indicated population.  
In the proposed SmPC indicated population (N=149), a total of 76 (93.8%) subjects in the OCA group 
and  61  (89.7%)  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  reported  at  least  1  TEAE.  Consistent  with  the  overall 
safety population, the most frequently reported TEAE was pruritus, which had a higher incidence in the 
OCA group (81.5%) than in the placebo group (47.1%). Pruritus is a known ADR per the current SmPC 
and was an AESI in Study 747-302. Pruritus is discussed in Section 2.8.3.4.6.  
Other frequently reported TEAEs (≥10% of OCA-treated subjects) which were higher in the OCA group 
compared to placebo included headache (16.0% in the OCA group and 14.7% in the placebo group), 
arthralgia (14.8% in the OCA group and 8.8% in the placebo group), abdominal pain upper (13.6% in 
the OCA group and 5.9% in the placebo group), diarrhoea (13.6% in the OCA group and 10.3% in the 
placebo  group),  nasopharyngitis  (13.6%  in  the  OCA  group  and  5.9%  in  the  placebo  group),  nausea 
(11.1% in the OCA group and 10.3% in the placebo group), and upper respiratory tract infection (11.1% 
in the OCA group and 4.4% in the placebo group).  
For reference, known ADR per the current SmPC include the following:  
• 
• 
Very commonly reported: Abdominal pain and discomfort, Pruritus, Fatigue;  
Commonly reported: Thyroid function abnormality, Dizziness, Palpitations, Oropharyngeal pain, 
Constipation, Eczema, Rash, Arthralgia, Oedema peripheral, Pyrexia;  
• 
Not known frequency: Hepatic failure, Blood bilirubin increased, Jaundice, Hepatic cirrhosis.

In  comparison  to  the  overall  and  compensated  populations,  the  incidence  of most  TEAEs  observed  in 
OCA-treated  subjects  was  markedly  lower  in  the  proposed  SmPC  indicated  population  including  the 
following hepatic preferred terms (PTs) which are of particular interest: oedema peripheral (18.5% in 
the overall, 13.2% in the compensated, and 4.9% in the proposed SmPC indicated populations), blood 
bilirubin increased (11.9% in the overall, 10.3% in the compensated, and 4.9% in the proposed SmPC 
indicated  populations),  ascites  (10.7%  in  the  overall,  6.6%  in  the  compensated,  and  1.2%  in  the 
proposed SmPC indicated populations), portal hypertensive gastropathy (8.3% in the overall, 8.1% in 
the compensated, and 3.7% in the proposed SmPC indicated populations), and hepatic cirrhosis (6.0% 
in the overall, 6.6% in the compensated, and 2.5% in the proposed SmPC indicated populations).

Adverse Events by Relatedness to Investigational Product  
A summary of treatment-related TEAEs in ≥2 OCA-treated subjects by system organ class (SOC) and PT 
by  overall,  decompensated  (contraindicated  per  current  SmPC),  compensated  (indicated  per  current 
SmPC),  the  proposed  SmPC  indicated,  and  proposed  SmPC  contraindicated  populations  has  been 
presented.

In comparison to the overall and compensated populations, individual treatment-related TEAEs occurred 
less frequently across treatment groups in the proposed SmPC indicated population.  
In  the  proposed  SmPC  indicated  population  (N=149),  61  (75.3%)  subjects  in  the  OCA  group  and  38 
(55.9%)  subjects in  the placebo group  reported  treatment-related  TEAEs.  Consistent  with the  overall 
and compensated populations, the difference in incidence of treatment-related TEAEs across treatment 
groups was largely driven by the occurrence of treatment-related pruritus (71.6% in the OCA group and 
42.6% in the placebo group). Pruritus is a known ADR per the current SmPC and was an AESI in Study 
747-302 (Section 2.8.3.4.6). Nausea occurred at a higher rate in the OCA group (6.2%) compared to 
the placebo group (2.9%). With the exception of pruritus and nausea, all other treatment-related TEAEs 
occurred in ≤2.5% OCA-treated subjects. 
Adverse Events by Severity

proposed SmPC indicated, and proposed SmPC contraindicated populations is presented in Table 61.  
-Proposed SmPC Indicated Population  
In  comparison  to  the  overall  and  compensated  populations,  individual  severe  TEAEs  occurred  less 
frequently across treatment groups in the proposed SmPC indicated population.  
In  the  proposed  SmPC  indicated  population  (N=149),  the  majority  of  TEAEs  were  mild  or  moderate 
across treatment groups. A total of 37 (45.7%) subjects in the OCA group and 22 (32.4%) subjects in 
the placebo group had at least one severe TEAE. The most frequently reported severe TEAE was pruritus: 
32.1% in the OCA group and 11.8% in the placebo group. With the exception of pruritus, individual PTs 
of severe TEAEs occurred in ≤2 subjects and were generally balanced across treatment groups. There 
were no severe hepatic events of ascites, oesophageal varices haemorrhage, hepatic cirrhosis, or hepatic 
failure in OCA-treated subjects in the proposed SmPC indicated population.

Deaths, Other Serious Adverse Events, and Other Significant Adverse Events  
Deaths  
A  summary  of  TEAEs  leading  to  death  by  PT  by  overall,  decompensated  (contraindicated  per  current 
SmPC), compensated (indicated per current SmPC), the proposed SmPC indicated, and proposed SmPC 
contraindicated populations is presented Table 62. A listing of all TEAEs leading to death is presented in 
Table 63.  
Proposed SmPC Indicated Population  
In  the  proposed  SmPC  indicated  population  (N=149),  1  subject  treated  with  OCA  died  of  acute 
respiratory  failure;  all  other  TEAEs  leading  to  death  (6  subjects)  occurred  in  the  proposed  SmPC 
contraindicated  population.  Details  of  the  fatal  event  in  the  proposed  SmPC  indicated  population  are 
briefly described below.  
•  A female subject with PBC died of acute respiratory failure on 10 Sep 2016 (Study Day 317), 
approximately 10 months after the initiation of OCA. On 20 Aug 2016 (Study Day 296), the 
subject was referred to the emergency room for evaluation of moderate left upper quadrant 
abdominal pain  (non-serious  adverse  event  [AE]).  On  23  Aug  2016  (Study  Day  299),  the 
subject was hospitalized with the diagnosis of Stage 4 B-cell lymphoma (serious TEAE) with 
renal/breast/lung/central nervous system involvement. The metastatic disease was thought 
to have originated in the right kidney. Per the Investigator, the subject did not have any risk 
factors for B-cell lymphoma. Investigational product was withdrawn in response to the events 
of lymphoma and acute kidney injury (AKI), with the last dose administered on 20 Aug 2016 
(Study Day 296). The Investigator assessed the event of lymphoma as severe and AKI as 
moderate  in  severity.  On  03  Sept  2016  (Study  Day  310),  the  subject  completed  the  first 
cycle  of  chemotherapy  (R-EPOCH).  On  05  Sep  2016  (Study  Day  312),  the  subject  was 
transferred to the intensive care unit as she developed acute hypoxemic respiratory failure 
(serious  TEAE)  and  subsequently  intubated  due  to  worsening  hypoxia  and  respiratory 
distress on 09 Sep 2016 (Study Day 316). Additional diagnoses were tumour lysis syndrome, 
EMA/528620/2023

pancytopenia with neutropenia and AKI. The subject’s family decided to pursue comfort care 
and the subject was extubated and died due to the event of acute respiratory failure on the 
same  day.  The  events  of  lymphoma,  AKI,  and  the  fatal  event  of  acute  respiratory  failure 
were all considered not related to investigational product by the Investigator.  
Other Serious Adverse Events  
Serious  TEAEs  by  PT  are  presented  by  overall,  decompensated  (contraindicated  per  current  SmPC), 
compensated  (indicated  per  current  SmPC),  the  proposed  SmPC  indicated,  and  proposed  SmPC 
contraindicated populations in Table 64.  
Proposed SmPC Indicated Population  
In  comparison  to  the  overall  and  compensated  populations,  the  proportion  of  serious  TEAEs  across 
treatment groups was lower in the proposed SmPC indicated population.  
In the proposed SmPC indicated population (N=149), the incidence of serious TEAEs was lower in the 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 227/319 
 
  
 
 
 
 
OCA group (15 [18.5%] subjects) than the placebo group (17 [25.0%] subjects). The most frequently 
reported serious TEAEs were thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) (2 [2.5%] subjects in the OCA 
group and none in the placebo group) and urinary tract infection (2 [2.5%] subjects in the OCA group 
and  1  [1.5%]  subject  in  the  placebo  group),  which  were  all  assessed  as  unlikely  or  not  related  to 
investigational product by the Investigator. All other individual serious TEAEs were reported in ≤1 OCA-
treated subject. 
Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation of Investigational Product  
A  summary  of  TEAEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  investigational  product  by  overall,  decompensated 
(contraindicated  per  current  SmPC),  compensated  (indicated  per  current  SmPC),  the  proposed  SmPC 
indicated, and proposed SmPC contraindicated populations is presented in Table 65.  
Proposed SmPC Indicated Population  
In the proposed SmPC indicated population (N=149), the incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation 
of investigational product was 27 (33.3%) subjects in the OCA group and 18 (26.5%) subjects in the 
placebo  group.  Consistent  with  the  overall,  decompensated  (contraindicated  per  current  SmPC)  and 
compensated (indicated per current SmPC) populations, the most frequently reported TEAE leading to 
discontinuation of investigational product was pruritus (14.8% in the OCA group and 2.9% in the placebo 
group). Pruritus is a known ADR per the current SmPC and was an AESI in Study 747-302.  
Incidence  of  other  PTs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  investigational  product  were  low  and  generally 
balanced across treatment groups. With the exception of pruritus, other TEAEs leading to investigational 
product which occurred higher in the OCA group compared to the placebo group included: potential liver 
injury event (2.5% in the OCA group and none in the placebo group); hyperbilirubinaemia (1.2% in the 
OCA group and none in the placebo group); and TTP (2.5% in the OCA group and none in the placebo 
group).

Overview of Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An overview of TEAESIs by overall, decompensated (contraindicated per current SmPC), compensated 
(indicated  per  current  SmPC),  the  proposed  SmPC  indicated,  and  proposed  SmPC  contraindicated 
populations is presented in Table 66.  
Proposed SmPC Indicated Population  
In the proposed SmPC indicated population (N=149), the incidence of hepatic and cardiovascular (CV) 
TEAESIs  was  lower  in  both  treatment  groups,  with  a  larger  decrease  observed  for  the  OCA-treated 
subjects when compared to the overall safety and compensated populations.  
A total of 71 (87.7%) subjects in the OCA group and 50 (73.5%) subjects in the placebo group reported 
TEAESIs. The majority of TEAESIs were mild or moderate in the proposed SmPC indicated population. 
Severe  TEAESIs  were  higher  in  the  OCA  group  (35.8%)  than  the  placebo  group  (22.1%),  which  was 
mostly  driven  by  pruritus  (for  pruritus  TEAESI,  see  Section  2.8.3.4.6).  Severe  treatment-emergent 
pruritus was 32.1% in the OCA group and 11.8% in the placebo group (Table 61).  
The most frequently reported (≥10%) TEAESIs in the proposed SmPC indicated population were pruritus 
(82.7% in the OCA group and 48.5% in the placebo group) and hepatic (27.2% in the OCA group and 
42.6% in the placebo group).

Hepatic  
A  comprehensive  evaluation  of  hepatic  events  was  performed,  including  analyses  of  Investigator-
reported,  hepatic  TEAESIs  (SMQ-based),  evaluation  of  drug-induced  serious  hepatotoxicity  (eDISH), 
adjudication of hepatic outcomes and hepatic safety events (e.g., drug-induced liver injury [DILI]) based 
on a broad set of hepatic trigger events (Investigator-reported TEAEs and pre-specified lab thresholds) 
to determine severity and causality by a blinded, independent adjudication committee.  
A summary of the hepatic evaluations by overall, decompensated (contraindicated per current SmPC), 
compensated  (indicated  per  current  SmPC),  proposed  SmPC  indicated,  and  proposed  SmPC 
contraindicated populations is presented in Table 67.  In comparison to the overall safety population, 
the  incidence  of  hepatic  events  observed  in  OCA  group  was  markedly  lower  in  the  proposed  SmPC 
indicated population.  
Investigator-reported Hepatic TEAESIs  
• Overall Safety Population (N=334)  
   -The  number of  subjects  with  at least one  hepatic  TEAE  was  80  (47.6%)  in  the  OCA  group  and 97 
(58.4%) in the placebo group.  
• Proposed SmPC indicated Population (N=149) 
   -Incidence of hepatic PTs in the OCA group (27.2%) were lower than the placebo group (42.6%).  
    -The difference between OCA-treated subjects and placebo is more pronounced when considering the 
incidence of exposure-adjusted hepatic TEAESIs (11.844 per 100 patient years [PYs] in the OCA group 
and 25.754 per 100 PYs in the placebo group).  
    -No  difference  was  observed  between treatment groups  of  exposure-adjusted  hepatic  SAEs  (1.396 
per 100 PYs in the OCA group and 1.385 per 100 PYs in the placebo group).  
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 230/319 
 
  
 
 
 
All  hepatic  outcomes  (i.e.,  European  Medicines  Agency  [EMA]  composite  endpoints  and  US  Food  and 
Drug  Administration  [FDA]  expanded  endpoints)  were  adjudicated  by  a  blinded,  independent  Hepatic 
Outcomes  Committee  (HOC)  to  determine  whether  they  met  the  protocol-specified  endpoint  criteria. 
Subsequently, per request from the FDA, all EMA and FDA expanded hepatic outcome events underwent 
additional  blinded  clinical  review  retrospectively  by  an  independent  Hepatic  Safety  Adjudication 
Committee  (HSAC)  to  determine  causality  (highly  likely  drug  related,  probable  drug  related,  possible 
drug related, unlikely drug related, insufficient information).  
Evaluation of Drug-induced Serious Hepatotoxicity  
•  Overall Safety Population (N=334) 
-More  subjects  in  the  OCA  group  (49.4%)  are  represented  in  the  normal  range  for  alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) and total bilirubin peak excursions compared toplacebo (35.5%). Fewer subjects 
in the OCA group met criteria for the biochemical Hy’s law range (peak ALT >3x upper limit of normal 
[ULN] and peak total bilirubin >2x ULN) and cholestasis range (peak total bilirubin >2x ULN, and ALT 
<3x ULN).  
• 
Proposed SmPC Indication (N=149) 
-  More  subjects in the  OCA  group  (60.5%)  were  in the normal  range  for  ALT and  total  bilirubin  peak 
excursions compared to placebo (45.6%). 
- Fewer subjects in the OCA group (12.3%) met criteria for the biochemical Hy’s law range compared to 
placebo (16.2%). Similar trends were observed for the cholestasis range (3.7% in the OCA group and 
4.4% in the placebo group).  
Adjudicated Hepatic Safety Events   
•  Overall Safety Population (N=334) 
There were 189 hepatic safety events in 85 subjects in the OCA group compared to 230 events in 99 
subjects in the placebo group.  
− Of those events, 18 subjects had events positively adjudicated as possibly related (n=17) or probably 
related to investigational product (n=1) events in the OCA group compared to 8 subjects (all possibly 
related) in the placebo group.  
− Of the 18 subjects, 12 in the OCA group had events ≥moderate severity compared to 7 subjects in 
the placebo group.  
• 
Proposed SmPC Indication (N=149) 
− 4 subjects had events positively adjudicated as possibly related to investigational product in the OCA 
group compared to 1 subject in the placebo group. Of these subjects, 2 subjects had events ≥moderate 
severity in the OCA group compared to 1 subject in the placebo group.  
− No subject had potential liver injury assessed as probable or highly likely by the HSAC, and all cases 
were reversible with discontinuation of OCA.  
− No subject with possible related potential liver injury progressed to liver failure, suffered accelerated 
disease  progression  after  the  event,  underwent  liver  transplantation  or  died  during  the  study  or  the 
follow up period.  
− All possible related potential liver injury events in the OCA group occurred within the first 3 months of 
investigational product, and no uniform pattern of liver injury was present.  
Adjudicated Hepatic Outcomes  
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 231/319 
 
  
 
 
All hepatic outcomes (i.e., EMA composite endpoints and FDA expanded endpoints) were adjudicated by 
a blinded, independent HOC to determine whether they met the protocol-specified endpoint criteria.  
Subsequently, per request from the FDA, all EMA and FDA expanded hepatic outcome events underwent 
additional blinded clinical review retrospectively by an independent HSAC to determine causality (highly 
likely  drug  related,  probable  drug  related,  possible  drug  related,  unlikely  drug  related,  insufficient 
information).  
• 
Proposed SmPC Indication (N=149) 
− EMA Composite Endpoint: A total of 1 subject with 1 event of liver transplant in the OCA group and 1 
subject  in  the  placebo  group  with  1  event  of  Model  for  End-Stage  Liver  Disease  (MELD)  ≥15  were 
considered possibly related to investigational product by the HSAC.  
− FDA Expanded Endpoint: A total of 3 (3.7%) subjects with 4 events in the OCA group and 1 (1.5%) 
subject with 4 events in the placebo group were considered possibly related to investigational product 
by the HSAC.  
−  None  of  the  OCA-treated  or  placebo  subjects  experienced  a  liver-related  death.  No  cases  were 
considered probable or highly likely. 
Comprehensive evaluation of hepatic safety events observed in clinical trials of OCA across indications 
has informed our understanding of OCA’s potential for hepatotoxicity. The majority of hepatic TEAESIs 
have been reported in subjects with advanced PBC who either had evidence of decompensation or PH, 
which forms the basis for our proposed SmPC to further restrict the indication. Restricting the label per 
the proposed SmPC indication allows for an improved safety profile.

Hepatic  decompensation/disorder  events  were  defined  by  Hepatic  Disorders  Standardised  MedDRA 
Queries  (SMQ),  excluding  the  following  sub-SMQs:  alcohol  related,  congenital,  familial,  neonatal,  and 
genetic disorders of the liver, liver infections, and pregnancy-related hepatic disorders.  
Proposed SmPC Indicated Population  
In comparison to the overall and compensated populations, the majority of hepatic TEAEs observed in 
OCA-treated subjects were meaningfully reduced in the proposed SmPC indicated population.  
In the proposed SmPC indicated population (N=149), the rates of hepatic PTs in the OCA group were 
lower than the placebo group (22 [27.2%] subjects in the OCA group and 29 [42.6%] subjects in the 
placebo group). The PT of portal hypertensive gastropathy occurred at a higher rate in the OCA group 
compared to the placebo group (3.7% in the OCA group and none in the placebo group). The majority 
of other reported PTs of hepatic TEAESIs either occurred at a similar incidence across treatment groups 
or at a lower incidence in the OCA group than the placebo group.  
The  majority  of  hepatic  TEAESIs  were  mild  to  moderate  in  severity.  The  incidence  of  severe  hepatic 
TEAESIs  was  low  across  treatment  groups  and  occurred  in  1  (1.2%)  subject  each  in  the  OCA  group: 
hepatic enzyme increased blood bilirubin increased (unlikely related per Investigator) and potential liver 
injury events (see Section 2.8.3.4.1.3 for mini narrative on adjudicated potential liver injury events). 
None of these events were reported as life-threatening or fatal.  
The incidence of serious hepatic TEAESIs remained low overall (3 [3.7%] subjects in the OCA group and 
2 [2.9%]) subjects in the placebo group). 
Exposure-Adjusted Incidence of Hepatic Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An analysis of exposure-adjusted incidences of hepatic TEAESIs and serious hepatic TEAESIs by overall, 
decompensated  (contraindicated  per  current  SmPC),  compensated  (indicated  per  current  SmPC),  the 
proposed SmPC indicated, and proposed SmPC contraindicated populations is presented in Table 70 and 
Table 71, respectively.  
The  trend  for  exposure-adjusted  hepatic  TEAESIs  was  generally  similar  to  those  observed  for  the 
unadjusted  rates.  Importantly,  when  evaluating  the  clinically  relevant  serious  hepatic  events,  no 
meaningful difference was observed in the exposure adjusted rates between the compensated and the 
proposed SmPC indicated populations.  
Proposed SmPC Indicated Population  
In comparison to the overall population, the incidence of exposure-adjusted hepatic TEAESIs observed 
in OCA-treated subjects was meaningfully reduced in the proposed SmPC indicated population.  
In  the  proposed  SmPC  indicated  population  (N=149),  the  incidence  of  exposure-adjusted  hepatic 
TEAESIs was 11.844 per 100 PYs in the OCA group and 25.754 per 100 PYs in the placebo group. The 
incidence of exposure-adjusted serious hepatic TEAESIs was 1.396 per 100 PYs in the OCA group and 
1.385 per 100 PYs in the placebo group.

Evaluation of Drug-induced Serious Hepatotoxicity  
Evaluation of drug-induced serious hepatotoxicity (eDISH) screening plot analyses were based on central 
and local laboratory results. Each data point represents the peak ALT and peak total bilirubin values from 
a single subject, and these values may have occurred at different timepoints over the observation period. 
As a sensitivity analysis, eDISH figures were also presented for the entire course of the study up to the 
last safety study day.

compensated  (indicated  per  current  SmPC),  the  proposed  SmPC  indicated,  and  proposed  SmPC 
contraindicated populations is presented in Table 72. eDISH comparing proposed SmPC indicated versus 
proposed SmPC contraindicated populations for total bilirubin vs. ALT are presented in Figure 31.  
Proposed SmPC Indicated Population  
The majority of subjects were in the normal range for ALT and total bilirubin peak excursions, with more 
subjects in the OCA group represented in the normal range compared to placebo.  
In an evaluation of all postbaseline measurements for the proposed SmPC indicated population, there 
was a total of 10 (12.3%) subjects in the OCA group and 11 (16.2%) subjects in the placebo group in 
the biochemical Hy’s law range (peak ALT of >3x ULN and peak total bilirubin >2x ULN).

Adjudicated Hepatic Safety Events  
As a retrospective assessment, hepatic safety events were identified via a set of biochemical and adverse 
event (SMQ based) triggers per HSAC. These cases underwent clinical review by the HSAC of all available 
data (medical history, concomitant medications, vital signs, lab values, liver imaging, pathology reports, 
and  noninvasive  tests)  for  each  identified  subject  to  determine  liver  injury  status  (including  causality 
and  severity).  The  adjudication  committee  remained  blinded  to  investigational  product  allocation  and 
assessed  the  potential  for  liver  injury,  assigned  likelihood  of  causality  and  degree  of  severity,  and 
provided potential etiology for all cases.  
Potential  hepatic  safety  events  (e.g.,  DILI)  were  identified  programmatically  using  SMQ  searches  of 
hepatic AEs, central and local laboratory data, and investigational product interruption records from the 
clinical database for hepatic injury. Hepatic AEs are defined as events included in the Hepatic Disorders 
SMQ,  excluding  the  following  sub-SMQs:  alcohol  related;  congenital,  familial,  neonatal,  and  genetic 
disorders of the liver; liver infections; and pregnancy-related hepatic disorders. Events were reviewed 
in conjunction with evaluation of medical history, concomitant medications, vital signs, lab values, liver 
imaging  and  pathology  reports,  and  non-invasive  tests  (NITs).  Adjudication  committees  remained 
blinded to investigational product allocation.  
Per the HSAC Charter, all cases adjudicated as potential evidence for liver injury are then assessed for 
causality  (investigational  product  relatedness)  and  severity  based  on  the  Drug-Induced  Liver  Injury 
Network (DILIN) index (Table 11).

Blinded  case  level  assessments  of  hepatic  events  in  the  overall,  decompensated  (contraindicated  per 
current SmPC), compensated (indicated per current SmPC), the proposed SmPC indicated, and proposed 
SmPC contraindicated populations are presented in Table 73.  
All hepatic events had sufficient information for a causality assessment. There was 1 subject in the OCA 
group and 1 subject in the placebo group with hepatic events that were not assessable for a severity 
assessment.

Proposed SmPC Indicated Population  
In  comparison  with  the  overall  population,  the  incidence  of  hepatic  safety  events  was  lower  in  OCA-
treated subjects in the proposed SmPC indicated population.  
In the proposed SmPC indicated population (N=149), hepatic safety event rate in the OCA group (29 
[35.8%] subjects) was lower compared to the placebo group (28 [41.2%] subjects).  
The  majority  of  the  hepatic  safety  events  were  mild  (18  [22.2%]  subjects  in  the  OCA  group  and  14 
[20.6%]  subjects  in  the  placebo  group)  and  moderate  (8  [9.9%]  subjects  in  the  OCA  group  and  11 
[16.2%] subjects in the placebo group). The incidence of moderate-severe, and severe hepatic safety 
events was similar across treatment groups.  
After blinded HSAC review, 4 subjects with 9 events in the OCA group and 1 subject with 2 events in the 
placebo group reported hepatic safety events that were adjudicated positively adjudicated as possibly 
related to investigational product (see mini narratives below). There were no potential liver injury events 
in the proposed SmPC indicated population assessed as probable or highly likely related to investigational 
product by the HSAC. The majority of subjects with possible causality were on concomitant medications 
with potential hepatotoxicity at the time of the potential liver injury event. All possible hepatic safety 
events  occurred  within  the  first  3  months  of  investigational  product,  and  no  uniform  pattern  of  liver 
injury was present.  
A listing of the positively adjudicated possible related events in the proposed SmPC indicated population 
are described below and presented in Table 74.  
OCA:  
• 
A 
female  subject  was 
found  to  have  elevated  transaminases  (ALT  and  aspartate 
aminotransferase [AST] >5x baseline) on 02 Aug 2017 (Study Day 92). Other liver biochemistry was 
stable  and  consistent  with  baseline.  Concomitant  and  potential  hepatotoxic  medication  included 
rifampicin, which was initiated on Study Day 15. Rifampicin and investigational product were stopped, 
and  the  subject  was  admitted  for  a  liver  biopsy.  Synthetic  liver  function  remained  normal,  and  no 
subsequent endpoint was reached. Elevated transaminases returned to baseline approximately 1 month 
after withdrawal of rifampicin and OCA. The Investigator judged the cause of the potential liver injury 
event to be most likely rifampicin.  
• 
A female subject was found to have an elevation in all liver biochemistries (ALT and AST >5x 
ULN and total bilirubin >3x ULN) on 22 Jun 2018 (Study Day 80). The subject had been diagnosed with 
cholecystolithiasis on 22 May 2018 (Study Day 49). It is unclear from the documentation whether there 
were any gallstone-related or obstructive symptoms. Investigational product was ceased on 22 Jun 2018 
(Study Day 80) and the subject underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy on 02 Aug 2018 (Study Day 
121).  On  12  Aug  2018  (Study  Day  131)  all  liver  biochemistry  had  improved  significantly;  no  further 
blood  tests  are  available  for  review  (end  of  study  [EOS]).  The  subject  was  also  taking  ibuprofen  and 
simvastatin at the time of the event.  
• 
A female subjectexperienced a significant elevation in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (ALP >1000 
U/L  and  >5%  increase  from  baseline)  on  Study  Day  91  with  a  lesser  degree  of  gamma-glutamyl 
transferase (GGT), total bilirubin, ALT, and AST elevation. OCA was dose reduced to 10 mg every other 
day on Study Day 135. ALP remained persistently elevated and OCA was withdrawn on Study Day 241 
due to pruritis and rash. There was mild improvement in peak ALP after OCA withdrawal, but ALP did 
not  return  to  baseline  and  remained  >1000  U/L  with  a  >15%  increase  from  baseline.  There  was  no 
associated synthetic liver function abnormality and the subject did not reach any endpoint by the end of 
study.

• 
A female subject experienced a single occasion of elevated ALT, AST (ALT/AST >3x baseline and 
>5x ULN), and GGT, without total bilirubin or ALP changes on Study Day 92. No changes were made to 
OCA dosing. Subsequent labs showed resolution of lab abnormalities without OCA dechallenge.  
Placebo:  
• 
A female subject with an elevation of predominantly GGT (467 U/L from baseline value of 261 
U/L) and total bilirubin (2.5 mg/dL from baseline value of 1.4 mg/dL) with more modest elevation of 
ALT, AST, and ALP on Study Day 104. Investigational product was discontinued and the event was judged 
by  the  Investigator  as  probably  related  to  investigational  product.  Concomitant  medications  included 
rifampicin at the time of the event. Laboratory results after Study Day 104 were unavailable.

Exposure-Adjusted Incidence of Adjudicated Drug-Induced Liver Injury  
An analysis of exposure-adjusted incidences of adjudicated hepatic safety events assessed as at least 
possibly related by the HSAC by baseline disease stage is presented in Table 75.  
Proposed SmPC Indicated Population  
In comparison to the overall population, the exposure-adjusted incidence of hepatic safety events that 
were assessed as possible, probable, or highly likely by the HSAC in the OCA-treated subjects was lower 
in the proposed SmPC indicated population. Of note, none of the cases in the proposed SmPC indicated 
population were considered probable or highly likely by the HSAC.  
In the proposed SmPC indicated population (N=149), the exposure-adjusted incidence of hepatic safety 
events that were assessed as at least possible by the HSAC was higher in the OCA group (1.910 per 100 
PYs) compared to the placebo group (0.685 per 100 PYs). The exposure-adjusted incidence of hepatic 
safety events that were assessed as at least possible and moderate in severity was higher in the OCA 
group (0.931 per 100 PYs) compared to the placebo group (0.685 per 100 PYs). 
Adjudicated Hepatic Outcomes  
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 242/319 
 
  
 
 
 
 
All hepatic outcomes (EMA Composite Endpoint and FDA Expanded Endpoint as defined in Table 76) were 
adjudicated  by  a  blinded,  independent  HOC  to  determine  whether  they  met  the  protocol-specified 
endpoint criteria.  
Subsequently, per request from the FDA, all EMA and FDA expanded hepatic outcome events underwent 
additional blinded clinical review retrospectively by an independent HSAC to determine causality (highly 
likely  drug  related,  probable  drug  related,  possible  drug  related,  unlikely  drug  related,  insufficient 
information). 
Proposed SmPC Indicated Population  
•  EMA  Composite  Endpoint:  A  total  of  1  subject  with  1  event  in  the  OCA  group  and  1  subject  in  the 
placebo group with 1 event were considered possibly related to investigational product by the HSAC.  
-  A subject in the OCA group had a liver transplant (see Question #13 for more details); Based on 
an ultrasound prior to study initiation showing significant splenomegaly and an endoscopy report 
which was equivocal for oesophageal varices, there is a suggestion that this subject had portal 
hypertension at baseline and would have been contraindicated per proposed SmPC. 
-  A subject in the placebo group had a MELD score ≥15 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 243/319 
 
  
 
 
 
 
• FDA Expanded Endpoint: A total of 3 (3.7%) subjects with 4 events in the OCA group and 1 (1.5%) 
subject with 4 events in the placebo group were considered possibly related to investigational product 
by the HSAC.  
-  One subject in the OCA group had a liver transplant; see Question #13 for more details); Based 
on  an  ultrasound  prior to study  initiation  showing  significant  splenomegaly  and  an  endoscopy 
report which was equivocal for oesophageal varices, there is a suggestion that the subject had 
portal hypertension at baseline and would have been contraindicated per proposed SmPC 
-  One subject in the OCA group had new onset of total bilirubin >3 mg/dL  
-  One  subject  in  the  OCA  group had  a  new  onset of  CP  ≥7  and  new  onset  of  total  bilirubin  >3 
mg/dL  
-  One subject in the placebo group had a MELD score ≥15 
No subjects in either the OCA group or the placebo group had hepatic outcomes adjudicated as probable 
or highly likely, and the majority of hepatic outcomes were adjudicated as unlikely.  
2.8.3.4.1.5. Adjudicated Liver Transplants and Deaths  
All liver transplants and deaths were independently adjudicated in a blinded manner by the HSAC.  
Adjudicated  liver  transplants  and  deaths  by  blinded  HSAC  causality  assessment  are  summarized  in 
Question #13.  
Cholecystitis/Cholelithiasis  
Cholecystitis/cholelithiasis  TEAESIs  were  defined  by  Gallbladder  related  disorders  narrow  SMQ  and 
Gallstone related disorders narrow SMQ.  
Cholecystitis/cholelithiasis TEAESIs and serious cholecystitis/cholelithiasis TEAESIs are summarized by 
overall, decompensated (contraindicated per current SmPC), compensated (indicated per current SmPC), 
the proposed SmPC indicated, and proposed SmPC contraindicated populations in Table 77 and Table 
78, respectively.  
Proposed SmPC Indicated Population  
In the proposed SmPC indicated population (N=149), 3 (3.7%) subjects in the OCA group and 1 (1.5%) 
subject in the placebo group reported a cholecystitis/cholelithiasis TEAESI. Cholelithiasis was the only 
PT reported across treatment groups. All cholecystitis/cholelithiasis TEAESIs were mild to moderate in 
severity.  
Of these, 1 OCA-treated subject in the proposed SmPC indicated population reported a serious TEAESI:  
-  A female subject with PBC in the proposed SmPC indicated population reported a serious TEAESI 
of cholelithiasis on 16 Dec 2019 (Study Day 1133), approximately 3 years and 1 month after 
initiation  of  OCA.  The  subject  had  a  history  of  gallbladder  stones  and  was  hospitalized  for  an 
elective laparoscopic assisted cholecystectomy due to cholelithiasis. The event of cholelithiasis 
was  considered  resolved  on  17  Dec  2019  (Study  Day  1134).  The  Investigator  and  the  MAH 
assessed  the  event  of  cholelithiasis  as  moderate  in  severity  and  unlikely  related  to  the 
investigational product.  
In addition, 1 OCA-treated subject in the proposed SmPC indicated population reported a serious AESI 
of  cholelithiasis  that  was  not  treatment-emergent  (i.e.,  after  30  days  of  permanently  discontinuing 
investigational product), which was considered possibly related by the Investigator and unlikely related 
by  the  Marketing  Authorization  Holder  (MAH).  The  event  was  assessed  as  moderate  in  severity  and 
resolved after an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed.

Exposure-Adjusted Incidence of Cholecystitis/Cholelithiasis Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An  analysis  of  exposure-adjusted  incidences  of  cholecystitis/cholelithiasis  TEAESIs  and  serious 
cholecystitis/cholelithiasis  TEAESIs  by  overall,  decompensated  (contraindicated  per  current  SmPC), 
compensated  (indicated  per  current  SmPC),  the  proposed  SmPC  indicated,  and  proposed  SmPC 
contraindicated populations is presented in Table 79 and Table 80.  
Proposed SmPC Indicated Population  
The  incidence  of  exposure-adjusted  cholecystitis/cholelithiasis  TEAESIs  was  1.416  per  100  PYs  in  the 
OCA  group  and  0.692  per  100  PYs  in  the  placebo  group.  The  incidence  of  exposure-adjusted  serious 
cholecystitis/cholelithiasis TEAESIs was 0.468 per 100 PYs in the OCA group and 0 per 100 PYs in the 
placebo.

Cardiovascular  
A  comprehensive  evaluation  of  CV  events  was  performed,  including  analyses  of  CV  events  by  PT,  CV 
TEAESIs  (defined  in  the  section  below),  adjudication  of  a  broad  set  of  CV  trigger  events  by  an 
independent adjudication committee, changes in lipoproteins, and Framingham Risk Score (FRS).  
Given the results outlined below, the MAH does not propose to include CV-identified risk in the proposed 
SmPC.  
EMA/528620/2023

Investigator-Reported Cardiovascular AESIs  
CV  TEAESIs  were  defined by  the  embolic  and  thrombotic  events  broad  SMQ,  ischaemic heart  disease 
broad SMQ, or central nervous system vascular disorders narrow SMQ. Of note, 2 events of TTP in 2 
OCA  treated  subjects  were  captured  in  the  SMQ  search  criteria  for  CV  TEAESIs.  However,  since  the 
underlying pathophysiology for TTP is not related to atherosclerotic vascular disease, the TTP cases are 
described in more detail in the renal TEAESI section.  
CV TEAESIs and serious CV TEAESIs are summarized by overall, decompensated (contraindicated per 
current SmPC), compensated (indicated per current SmPC), the proposed SmPC indicated, and proposed 
SmPC contraindicated populations in Table 81 and Table 82, respectively.  
Proposed SmPC Indicated Population  
In comparison to the overall population, the rate for majority of CV TEAESIs observed in OCA-treated 
subjects was significantly lower in the proposed SmPC indicated population.  
In the proposed SmPC indicated population (N=149), 5 (6.2%) subjects in the OCA group and 2 (2.9%) 
subjects in the placebo group reported a CV TEAESI.  
Apart from TTP, which is described in more detail in the renal TEAESI section, no pattern was observed 
for individual CV PTs and no CV PT was reported by > 1 subject in either treatment group.  
The incidence of serious CV TEAESIs was similar across treatment groups (2.5% in the OCA group and 
1.5%  in  the  placebo  group),  with  2  and  1  subjects  who  reported  serious  TEAESIs  of  TTP  and 
cerebrovascular accident, respectively.

Exposure-Adjusted Incidence of Cardiovascular Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Exposure-adjusted  incidences  of  CV  TEAESIs  and  serious  CV  TEAESIs  are  summarized  by  overall, 
decompensated  (contraindicated  per  current  SmPC),  compensated  (indicated  per  current  SmPC),  the 
proposed SmPC indicated, and proposed SmPC contraindicated populations in Table 83 and Table 84, 
respectively.  
The trend for exposure-adjusted CV TEAESIs was generally similar to those observed for the unadjusted 
rates. Importantly, when evaluating the clinically relevant serious CV events, no meaningful difference 
was observed in the exposure adjusted rates between the OCA and placebo treated subjects in both the 
compensated and the proposed SmPC indicated populations.  
Proposed SmPC Indicated Population  
In  comparison  to  the  overall  population,  the  incidence  of  exposure-adjusted  CV  TEAESIs  observed  in 
OCA-treated subjects was reduced significantly in the proposed SmPC indicated population.  
In the proposed SmPC indicated population (N=149), the incidence of exposure-adjusted CV TEAESIs 
was 2.386 per 100 PYs in the OCA group and 1.385 per 100 PYs in the placebo group. The incidence of 
exposure-adjusted serious CV TEAESIs was 0.931 per 100 PYs in the OCA group and 0.689 per 100 PYs 
in the placebo group.

Adjudicated Cardiovascular Events  
All  suspected  Major  Adverse  Cardiovascular  Events  (MACE),  including  CV  death,  non-fatal  myocardial 
infarction,  non-fatal  stroke,  and  additional  CV  events  were  adjudicated  by  an  independent  CV 
adjudication committee in a blinded fashion.  
Potential events were identified programmatically using searches for fatal events, hospitalizations, and 
SMQ based searches for CV TEAEs. SMQ trigger events included ischaemic heart disease, cardiac failure, 
Torsade  de  pointes/  QT  interval  of  the  electrocardiogram  (QT)  prolongation,  arrhythmia  related 
investigations,  signs  and  symptoms,  cardiac  arrhythmia  terms  [including  bradyarrhythmias  and 
tachyarrhythmias], and central nervous system haemorrhages and cerebrovascular conditions. Events 
were reviewed in conjunction with evaluation of medical history, concomitant medications, vital signs, 
prespecified  lab  values,  and  electrocardiograms  (ECGs).  Adjudication  committee  members  remained 
blinded to investigational product treatment assignment (CAC Charter, Version 7).  
A  panel of  up to  7  independent  CV  experts  (in groups  of  3)  adjudicated  a  broad  set  of  suspected  CV 
events and hospitalizations while blinded to study treatment assignment. Endpoints assessed by the CV 
adjudication  committee  included  non-fatal  myocardial  infarction  (MI),  non-fatal  stroke,  CV  death, 
hospitalization for unstable angina, all causes of death, transient ischemic attack, coronary/peripheral 
revascularization  procedures,  arrhythmias,  or  hospitalization/urgent  visit  for  heart  failure.  Event 
adjudication required agreement between at least two reviewers; independent review was conducted by 
the third member if the initial two members were not in agreement.  
Adjudicated  MACE  is  summarized  by  overall,  decompensated  (contraindicated  per  current  SmPC), 
compensated  (indicated  per  current  SmPC),  the  proposed  SmPC  indicated,  and  proposed  SmPC 
contraindicated populations in Table 85.  
Proposed SmPC Indicated Population  
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 250/319 
 
  
 
 
 
In comparison to the overall population, the incidence of MACE observed in OCA-treated subjects was 
significantly lower in the proposed SmPC indicated population.  
In the proposed SmPC indicated population (N=149), 1 (1.2%) subject in the OCA group experienced 
an adjudicated stroke as a complication of a thrombotic microangiopathy (this subject was diagnosed 
with  TTP,  narrative  is  provided  below).  Three  (4.4%)  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  reported  an 
adjudicated  MACE;  arrhythmia  and  heart  failure  were  reported  in  1  (1.5%)  and  2  (2.9%)  subjects, 
respectively.  
• 
A female subject with PBC reported serious TEAESIs of cerebrovascular accident and TTP on 10 
Oct 2019 (Study Day 441), approximately 1 year and 3 months after the initiation of OCA. While the 
subject was in the proposed SmPC indicated population when she began OCA, she had an elastography 
score of 16.5 kPa measured on 29 Jan 2019 (Study Day 187) which would exclude use of OCA per the 
proposed  SmPC.  This  subject  presented  several  months  later  to  the  emergency  department  for 
evaluation and was admitted to the intensive care unit with the diagnosis of sub-acute stroke (serious 
TEAESI of cerebrovascular accident) and subsequently a confirmed a diagnosis of TTP with disintegrin 
and  metalloproteinase  with  thrombospondin  motifs  activity  at  2%.  Investigational  product  was 
withdrawn in response to the events of cerebrovascular accident and TTP. The event of cerebrovascular 
accident was considered resolved on 26 Oct 2019 (Study Day 457) and TTP was considered resolved on 
04 Dec 2019 (Study Day 496). Both events were considered severe in severity and unlikely related to 
investigational product.  
In summary, when considering the proposed SmPC indicated population, there is no clear signal for an 
increased CV risk based on analyses of the adjudicated CV events in a rigorous manner. 
Exposure-Adjusted Incidence of Adjudicated CV Events  
Exposure-adjusted incidences of MACE by PT is summarized by overall, decompensated 
(contraindicated per current SmPC), compensated (indicated per current SmPC), the proposed SmPC 
indicated, and proposed SmPC contraindicated populations in Table 86.  
Proposed SmPC Indicated Population  
In comparison to the overall population, the incidence of exposure-adjusted adjudicated CV events in 
OCA-treated subjects was reduced significantly in the proposed SmPC indicated population.  
In the proposed SmPC indicated population (N=149), the incidence of exposure-adjusted adjudicated 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 251/319 
 
  
 
 
 
CV events was lower in the OCA group (0.465 per 100 PYs in the OCA group and 2.121 per 100 PYs in 
the placebo group). 
Lipoprotein Evaluations  
Mean total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) values over 
time are summarized by overall and proposed SmPC indicated populations in Figure 32.  
Overall (N=334)  
At baseline, the mean value for each of the lipid parameters was similar across treatment groups, with 
values meeting the criteria of Abnormal for total cholesterol (defined as ≥200 mg/dL) and LDL (defined 
as ≥100 mg/dL). Mean values across OCA and placebo groups were ~269 mg/dL, ~152 mg/dL, ~72 
mg/dL and for total cholesterol, LDL, and HDL, respectively.  
Overall, mean total cholesterol values decreased over time, with a more rapid decrease observed in 
the first 6 months in the OCA group compared to the placebo group. Mean LDL values were also similar 
across OCA and placebo treatment groups, which decreased over time in both treatment groups. In the 
OCA group, an early decrease in HDL was observed by Month 1, with values approaching baseline by 
Month 18.  
Proposed SmPC Indicated Population (N=149)  
In the proposed SmPC indicated population, mean total cholesterol values decreased over time, with a 
more rapid decrease observed in the first 6 months in the OCA group compared to the placebo group. 
Mean cholesterol decreased from 282.0 mg/dL (baseline) to 242.6 mg/dL (Month 6) and 245.8 mg/dL 
(Month 30) in the OCA group. Mean cholesterol decreased from 289.4 mg/dL (baseline) to 269.8 
mg/dL (Month 6) and 254.1 mg/dL (Month 30) in the placebo group.  
Mean LDL values were similar across OCA and placebo treatment groups, with decreased values 
observed over time. Mean LDL cholesterol decreased from 159.77 mg/dL (baseline) to 147.93 mg/dL 
(Month 6) and 145.85 mg/dL (Month 30) in the OCA group. Mean LDL cholesterol decreased from 
162.27 mg/dL (baseline) to 145.92 mg/dL (Month 6) and 137.26 mg/dL (Month 30) in the placebo 
group. Most subjects reported concomitant use of lipid-modifying agents, with higher use reported in 
the placebo group (60.3% subjects) compared to the OCA group (54.3% subjects).  
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 252/319 
 
  
 
 
 
Lipid data for very few subjects is available at later timepoints, leading to high variability in mean 
values and an apparent rise in LDL at Month 42; data at later timepoints should thus be interpreted 
with caution. Overall, decreased LDL values were observed over time.  
In the OCA group, an early decrease in HDL was observed by Month 1, with values approaching baseline 
by  Month  12  and  remaining  stable  out  to  Month  30.  Mean  HDL  levels  decreased  from  82.91  mg/dL 
(baseline) to 74.12 mg/dL (Month 1), with a low of 72.90 mg/dL (Month 3), before increasing to 79.39 
mg/dL (Month 12) and 81.54 mg/dL (Month 30). Mean HDL cholesterol values were relatively stable over 
time in the placebo group (86.38 mg/dL [baseline], 83.42 mg/dL [Month 1], 85.72 mg/dL [Month 3], 
87.24 mg/dL [Month 12], 86.75 mg/dL [Month 30]). 
Shift analyses from baseline to postbaseline LDL cholesterol levels by visit are provided in Table 87 
(compensated vs decompensated populations) and Table 88 (proposed SmPC indicated vs proposed 
SmPC contraindicated populations). In the proposed SmPC indicated population, the majority of 
subjects in both treatment groups met the criteria of Abnormal for LDL at baseline, defined as ≥100

mg/dL. Few subjects shifted from Normal LDL levels at baseline to Abnormal LDL levels, with no 
notable differences observed between treatment groups.  
Shift  analyses  from  baseline  to  postbaseline  HDL  cholesterol  levels  by  visit  are  provided  in  Table  89 
(compensated  vs  decompensated  populations)  and  Table  90  (proposed  SmPC  indicated  vs  proposed 
SmPC contraindicated populations). In the proposed SmPC indicated population, the majority of subjects 
in both treatment groups met the criteria of Normal for HDL at baseline, defined as ≥40 mg/dL in men 
or ≥50 mg/dL in women. More subjects in the OCA group shifted from Normal HDL levels at baseline to 
Abnormal HDL levels by Month 1 (19.5% in the OCA group and 0 in the placebo group). This shift was 
maintained at Month 3 (16.4% in the OCA group and 3.1% in the placebo group), Month 12 (14.0% in 
the OCA group and 6.1% in the placebo group), and Month 24 (13.6% in the OCA group and 6.9% in 
the placebo group). By Month 42, the shift from Normal to Abnormal had normalized between treatment 
groups.

Framingham Risk Scores  
In order to assess CV risk in a comprehensive manner, Framingham risk score (FRS) at baseline and 
on treatment was assessed. The FRS is a well-characterized risk assessment tool used as a first step in 
coronary risk assessment. It includes risk factors of gender, age, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, 
systolic blood pressure, and smoking status to assess an individual’s 10-year risk for myocardial 
infarction and cardiac death. An FRS score of <10% indicates a 10-year predicted low risk for a 
coronary event, FRS of 10% to 20% indicates intermediate risk, and FRS of ≥20% indicates high risk 
for a coronary event.  
FRS was summarized by overall, decompensated (contraindicated per current SmPC), compensated 
(indicated per current SmPC), the proposed SmPC indicated, and proposed SmPC contraindicated 
populations at baseline, M12, and M42 in Table 91.  
Proposed SmPC Indicated Population  
In comparison to the overall population, mean FRS in OCA-treated subjects was lower in the proposed 
SmPC indicated population.  
In the proposed SmPC indicated population (N=149), mean FRS was 7% in the OCA group and 9% in 
the placebo group at baseline. Values remained <10% at Month 12 and Month 42 in the OCA and placebo 
groups, indicating a 10-year predicted low risk for a coronary event.

Dyslipidaemia  
Dyslipidaemia TEAESIs were defined by the Dyslipidaemia SMQ.  
Dyslipidaemia TEAESIs are summarized by overall, decompensated (contraindicated per current 
SmPC), compensated (indicated per current SmPC), the proposed SmPC indicated, and proposed 
SmPC contraindicated populations in Table 92.  
Proposed SmPC Indicated Population  
In the proposed SmPC indicated population (N=149), the incidence rate of dyslipidaemia TEAESIs was 
similar across treatment groups (4.9% in the OCA group and 4.4% in the placebo group). The most 
frequently reported dyslipidaemia TEAESI was low density lipoprotein increased (2 [2.5%] subjects in 
the OCA group and none in the placebo group).  
All dyslipidaemia TEAESIs in the proposed SmPC indicated population were mild to moderate in severity. 
No subjects reported serious dyslipidaemia TEAESIs or a TEAESI leading to discontinuation.

Exposure-Adjusted Incidence of Dyslipidaemia TEAESIs  
Exposure-adjusted incidences of dyslipidaemia TEAESIs are summarized by overall, decompensated 
(contraindicated per current SmPC), compensated (indicated per current SmPC), the proposed SmPC 
indicated, and proposed SmPC contraindicated populations in Table 93.  
The trend for exposure adjusted dyslipidaemia TEAESIs was generally similar to those observed for the 
unadjusted rates.  
Proposed SmPC Indicated Population  
The incidence of exposure-adjusted dyslipidaemia TEAESIs was 1.924 per 100 PYs in the OCA group and 
2.236 per 100 PYs in the placebo group. 
Renal  
Renal TEAESIs were defined as events included in the following broad SMQs: acute renal failure, chronic 
kidney  disease,  proteinuria,  renovascular  disorders,  or  tubulointerstitial  diseases.  This  represents  a 
heterogenous groups of terms representing both primary (e.g., leukocyturia, haematuria) and secondary 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 259/319 
 
  
 
 
 
 
renal  (e.g.,  renal  lymphoma,  diabetic  nephropathy)  and  urinary  tract  pathology  (e.g.,  urinary  tract 
infection) as well as signs that could be associated with a renal or hepatic etiology (e.g., hyponatraemia, 
hypoalbuminaemia).  
The PT of TTP is included in the SMQs of both CV and renal TEAESIs. TTP belongs to the spectrum of 
thrombotic microangiopathies potentially affecting the vasculature of any organ (most commonly renal 
and cerebral). It presents with spontaneous thrombi formation as well as bleeding due to a deficiency of 
the  functional  enzyme  ADAMTS13,  which  cleaves  ultra  large  von  Willebrand  factor  (VWF)  multimers 
released from endothelial cells into smaller multimers, making them less adhesive to platelets. With the 
deficiency,  the  ultra  large  VWF  multimers  are  released  and  bind  spontaneously  to  platelets  to  form 
aggregates within microvessels. While these events are captured as part of the broad SMQ based search 
for  CV  and  renal  TEAESIs,  because  of  the  very  unique  underlying  mechanism,  TTP  events  are  more 
appropriately considered separately and are summarized in this section describing renal events.  
Renal TEAESIs are summarized by overall and baseline disease stage in Table 94.  
Proposed SmPC Indicated Population  
In the proposed SmPC indicated population (N=149), 8 (9.9%) subjects in the OCA group and 4 (5.9%) 
subjects in the placebo group reported renal TEAESIs. Apart from the PTs of TTP which was reported by 
2 subjects in the OCA group (2.5%), the remaining renal events were reported by 1 OCA-treated subject 
(1.2%) each: AKI, hypoalbuminaemia, proteinuria, diabetic nephropathy, leukocyturia, and renal failure. 
See below for brief narratives for TTP and AKI.  
With the exception of TTP, all other renal TEAESIs in OCA-treated subjects were mild to moderate in 
severity.  
The renal TEAESIs of TTP in the proposed SmPC indicated population are briefly discussed below. None 
of the cases were considered related to investigational product.  
-  A  female  subject  presented  to  hospital  with  confusion  and  a  syncope  having  been  severely 
thrombocytopenic for at least 27 days prior to the presentation. The TESAE of TTP was diagnosed 
on 06 Jun 2016 (Study Day 111), approximately 4 months after the initiation of OCA. The patient 
began rifampicin approximately 3 months after the initiation of OCA, and it was ongoing at the 
time  of  the  event.  Investigational  product  was  initially  interrupted  and  later  withdrawn  in 
response to the event. The peak creatinine documented following the diagnosis of TTP was mildly 
elevated  at  1.5  mg/dL  (reference  range:  0.6-1.3).  The  subject  was  treated  with  steroids, 
plasmapheresis,  and  Rituximab.  The  event  was  considered  resolved  with  sequelae 
(plasmapheresis [as needed]) on 09 Jul 2016 (Study Day 144). The Investigator assessed the 
event of TTP as severe and not related to investigational product.  
-  A female subject with PBC reported serious TEAESIs of cerebrovascular accident and TTP on 10 
Oct 2019 (Study Day 441), approximately 1 year and 3 months after the initiation of OCA. While 
the  subject  was  programmatically  assigned  to  the  proposed  SmPC  indicated  population  upon 
initiation  of  OCA,  elastography  score  of  16.5  kPa  was  measured  on  29  Jan  2019  (Study  Day 
187). On 10 Oct 2019 (Study Day 441) the subject presented to the emergency department for 
evaluation and was admitted to the intensive care unit with the diagnosis of sub-acute stroke 
(serious TEAESI of cerebrovascular accident) and subsequently a confirmed a diagnosis of TTP 
with  disintegrin  and  metalloproteinase  with  thrombospondin  motifs  activity  noted  low  at  2%. 
Investigational product was withdrawn in response to the events of cerebrovascular accident and 
TTP. The event of cerebrovascular accident was considered resolved on 26 Oct 2019 (Study Day 
457)  and  TTP  was  considered  resolved  on  04  Dec  2019  (Study  Day  496).  Both  events  were 
considered severe in severity and unlikely related to investigational product.  
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 260/319 
 
  
 
 
Examining the two cases of TTP that occurred in subjects receiving OCA, 1 had ongoing treatment with 
rifampicin at the time of the event. Rifampicin has a reported association with TTP (Hamad 2020, Fahal 
1992, Gupta 2005). The second subject with TTP was likely idiopathic, which is consistent with current 
understanding (Joly 2017).  
1 non-serious TEAE of AKI was reported in 1 OCA-treated subject in the proposed SmPC indicated 
population and is briefly discussed below. The Investigator considered the event not related to 
investigational product.  
-  A female subject with PBC was referred to the emergency room on 20 Aug 2016 (Study Day 
296) for evaluation of moderate left upper quadrant abdominal pain (non-serious AE). On 23 
Aug 2016 (Study Day 299), the subject was hospitalized with the diagnosis of Stage 4 B-cell 
lymphoma (SAE) with renal/breast/lung/central nervous system involvement. The metastatic 
disease was thought to have originated from the right kidney. On the same day, the subject 
was reported to have “acute kidney injury” on the basis of an elevated serum urea level but 
otherwise normal renal function tests (note: urea is commonly elevated in metastatic 
lymphoma patients). Investigational product was withdrawn in response to the events of 
lymphoma and AKI, with the last dose administered on 20 Aug 2016 (Study Day 296). The 
Investigator assessed the event of lymphoma as severe and AKI as moderate in severity. On 
03 Sept 2016 (Study Day 310), the subject completed the first cycle of chemotherapy (R-
EPOCH). On 05 Sep 2016 (Study Day 312), the subject was transferred to the intensive care 
unit as she developed acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (serious adverse event [SAE]) and 
subsequently intubated due to worsening hypoxia and respiratory distress on 09 Sep 2016 
(Study Day 316). Additional diagnoses were tumour lysis syndrome, and pancytopenia with 
neutropenia. The subject’s family decided to pursue comfort care and the subject was 
extubated and died due to the event of acute respiratory failure on the same day. The events 
of lymphoma, AKI, and the fatal event of acute respiratory failure were all considered not 
related to investigational product by the Investigator. One event of renal failure (non-serious) 
and one event of diabetic nephropathy (non-serious) was reported in 1 OCA-treated subjects in 
the proposed SmPC indicated population. These events were considered mild and not related to 
investigational product by the Investigator.  
-  A female subject with PBC and a history of pruritus, initiated OCA study treatment on 13 Jan 
2017. The subject’s serum creatinine at baseline on 12 Jan 2018 was 0.87 mg/dL (reference 
range: 0.51 – 0.96 mg/dL). On 23 Feb 2018 (D42), the subject experienced an episode of 
severe pruritus and was maintained rifampicin, phenobarbital, and cholestyramine with the 
addition of bezafibrate. On 11 Jul 2018 (D180), a serum creatinine value of 0.92 mg/dL was 
reported for the subject a MELD score of 6.4. Approximately 8 months after the initiation of 
OCA, the subject discontinued study treatment on 21 Aug 2018 (D221), the same day she was 
admitted for a planned liver transplantation due to intractable pruritus. On 03 Sept 2018 
(D234), the subject underwent a successful liver transplantation without complication and was 
initiated on treatments with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, 
sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, valganciclovir hydrochloride, prednisone, and magnesium 
hydroxide. Subsequently, an event of renal failure was recorded on 17 Sept 2018 (D248) 
having discontinued bezafibrate treatment shortly before on 14 Sept 2018 (D245). At the 
onset of the renal failure event, the subject reported the concurrent AEs of anaemia, chills, 
constipation, diarrhoea, and oral candidiasis. The subject remained on hydrochlorothiazide, 
tacrolimus, and sulfamethoxazole through the event of renal failure. On 18 Oct 2018 (D279), a 
peak serum creatinine value of 1.20 mg/dL (reference range: 0.51 – 0.96 mg/dL) was 
reported. The subject withdrew from the study 18 Oct 2018 (D279).  
EMA/528620/2023

-  A male subject with PBC and a history of pruritus, type 1 diabetes mellitus (insulin dependent), 
and hypertension (on hydrochlorothiazide since 2006) initiated OCA study treatment on 05 Dec 
2016. Serum creatinine at baseline on 02 Dec 2016 was 1.02 mg/dL (reference range: 0.67 – 
1.17 mg/dL). On 12 Dec 2016 the subject was reported to have a moderate increase in blood 
pressure determined by the investigator to be unlikely related to study treatment and the 
subject was initiated on amlodipine the same day after discontinuing hydrochlorothiazide on 11 
Dec 2016. Due to excessive pain of the cervical and thoracic spine, the subject initiated 
celecoxib and diclofenac sodium on 30 Nov 2017 before discontinuing these therapies on 10 
Dec 2017. On 07 April 2018 the subject initiated ibuprofen and pseudoephedrine for acute 
frontal sunisitis before discontinuing these therapies on 07 May 2018. The subject was 
administered diclofenac sodium and meloxicam transiently in for spine pain in Aug 2018. On 11 
Sept 2019, the subject had a serum creatinine level of 1.22 mg/dL (reference range: 0.67 – 
1.17 mg/dL). Subsequently, the subject experienced an event of mild diabetic nephropathy on 
09 Dec 2019, which the investigator determined was not related to study treatment. The 
subject had insulin-dependent type 1 diabetes mellitus at the time of study enrollment per 
reported medical history (unknown onset date). The presence of proteinuria was not provided. 
On 09 Dec 2019, the subject had a serum creatinine level of 1.28 mg/dL (reference range: 
0.67 – 1.17 mg/dL). The subject was administered meloxicam for spine pain in Sept 2019. 
Peak serum creatinine was observed on 17 Dec 2020 of 1.54 mg/dL. The subject discontinued 
study treatment on 01 Dec 2021 due to study termination by the MAH.  
Exposure-Adjusted Incidence of Renal TEAESIs  
An analysis of exposure-adjusted incidences of renal TEAESIs and serious renal TEAESIs by baseline 
disease stage is presented in Table 95 and Table 96.  
Proposed SmPC Indicated Population  
EMA/528620/2023

In the proposed SmPC indicated population (N=149), the incidence of exposure-adjusted renal 
TEAESIs was 3.818 per 100 PYs in the OCA group and 2.877 per 100 PYs in the placebo group.  
The incidence of exposure-adjusted serious renal TEAESIs was 0.931 per 100 PYs in the OCA group and 
0 per 100 PYs in the placebo group. The serious renal TEAESI reported in the OCA group was TTP.

Renal Function Evaluations  
Analyses of serum chemistry parameters included markers of renal function (serum creatinine, 
estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]). Mean creatinine values over time are displayed in Figure 
33 (overall versus proposed SmPC indicated populations) and Figure 34 (compensated versus 
decompensated populations). Mean eGFR values over time are displayed in Figure 35 (overall), Figure 
36 (proposed SmPC indicated versus proposed SmPC contraindicated populations), and Figure 37 
(compensated versus decompensated populations).  
Proposed Indicated SmPC Population  
In the proposed SmPC indicated population (N=149), no clinically significant changes over time or across 
treatment groups were observed for serum creatinine or eGFR.

Pruritus  
Pruritus TEAESIs were defined as any preferred term within the Pruritus Not Elsewhere Classified 
(NEC) high level term or any preferred term including “prur”. Pruritus is a well characterized and 
known ADR of OCA.  
Pruritus  TEAESIs  are  summarized  by  overall,  decompensated  (contraindicated  per  current  SmPC), 
compensated  (indicated  per  current  SmPC),  the  proposed  SmPC  indicated,  and  proposed  SmPC 
contraindicated populations in Table 97.  
Proposed SmPC Indicated Population  
The incidence for pruritus was higher in the OCA group (82.7%) compared to the placebo group (48.5%).  
The majority of pruritus events were mild to moderate and managed with temporary interruption of OCA 
treatment or use of medications such as antihistamines for control of symptoms. The incidence of serious 
pruritus TEAESIs was low; 1 subject in the OCA group and none in the placebo group reported a serious 
TEAESI of pruritus.  
Pruritus TEAEs that led to discontinuation of investigational product were reported in 14.8% OCA-treated 
subjects compared with 2.9% of placebo subjects. 
Exposure-Adjusted Incidence of Pruritus TEAESIs  
Exposure-adjusted  incidence  of  pruritus  TEAESIs  and  serious  pruritus  TEAESIs  are  summarized  by 
overall, decompensated (contraindicated per current SmPC), compensated (indicated per current SmPC), 
the proposed SmPC indicated, and proposed SmPC contraindicated populations in Table 98 and Table 
99, respectively.  
Proposed SmPC Indicated Population  
The incidence of exposure-adjusted pruritus TEAESIs was 102.046 per 100 PYs in the OCA group and 
34.642 per 100 PYs in the placebo group.  
The incidence of exposure-adjusted serious pruritus TEAESIs was 0.465 per 100 PYs in the OCA group 
and 0 per 100 PYs in the placebo group.

Management of Pruritus  
Management strategies for pruritus are summarized by overall, decompensated (contraindicated per 
current SmPC), compensated (indicated per current SmPC), the proposed SmPC indicated, and 
proposed SmPC contraindicated populations in Table 100.  
Proposed SmPC Indicated Population  
An assessment of management strategies for pruritus was conducted in the proposed SmPC indicated 
population; results are as follows:  
• 
23.5% of subjects in the OCA group reported a drug interruption (i.e., a drug 
holiday) or a decrease in dose to manage pruritus. Most subjects who reported a drug 
interruption for pruritus experienced a single interruption.  
• 
A medication was used to manage pruritus in approximately 54.3% of subjects 
in the OCA group. The most commonly used medications to manage pruritus were 
antihistamines (33.3% of subjects) and bile acid sequestrants (BAS) (18.5% of 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 268/319 
 
  
 
 
 
 
subjects). A total of 33.3% of OCA-treated subjects reported use of “other” types of 
medications, which most frequently included rifampicin, naltrexone, and selective 
serotonin inhibitors; no trend was observed for any particular medication class.  
Laboratory Values Over Time  
Haematology and Coagulation  
No clinically significant changes over time or across treatment groups were observed with respect to 
Haematology and Coagulation parameters.  
Serum Chemistry  
Analyses of serum chemistry parameters and liver biochemistry included markers of hepatocellular 
injury (ALT, AST), cholestasis (GGT, ALP, bilirubin [total and direct]), liver synthetic function (INR, 
albumin), and portal hypertension (platelet count).  
Mean serum chemistry parameter values over time are summarized by overall versus proposed SmPC 
indicated populations in Figure 38 and by compensated versus decompensated populations in Figure 
39.  
Proposed SmPC Indicated Population  
Consistent trends in serum chemistry parameters were observed in the overall and proposed SmPC 
indicated populations. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
As initially noted, Study 747-302 shows a more concerning overall safety profile as compared to that 
reported in the initial submission, given the higher incidence rates of all types of TEAEs overall and as 
compared to placebo treated patients. OCA treated patients showed a higher incidence of TEAEs, severe 
TEAEs,  TEAEs  leading  to  discontinuation,  and  TEAEs  leading  to  death,  both  in  the  general  safety 
population  and  the  subset  of  patients  with  compensated  liver  disease.  In  addition,  the  higher  rates 
observed  in  OCA  treated  patients  for  some  relevant  AESI  like  cardiovascular  events  (including 
adjudicated MACE), renal events (including AKI), DILI and portal hypertensive gastropathy events, liver 
transplant  and  death  adjudicated  events,  both  in  the  overall  safety  population  and  for  the  subset  of 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 269/319 
 
  
 
 
 
patients with compensated disease are a matter of major concern.  
The  MAH  recognizes  there  is  some  potential  safety  risk  given  the  imbalance  observed  in  the  overall 
safety population of Study 747-302 and cannot exclude a contributory role of OCA. Therefore, the MAH 
has proposed to further restrict the SmPC indicated population to patients with PBC without cirrhosis or 
with  compensated  cirrhosis  who  do  not  have  clinical  evidence  of  portal  hypertension  or  a  prior 
decompensation event. This analysis was not pre-specified and the newly proposed target population for 
OCA is data driven by an otherwise limited number of subjects of Study 747-302. Thus, it is uncertain if 
a more benign safety profile can be firmly concluded in this subset of PBC patients.  
A reduction in the overall incidence of serious TEAEs (18.5% OCA vs 25% placebo in the newly proposed 
indication vs 31.5% OCA vs 31.9% placebo in the overall safety population) and TEAE leading to death 
(1.2%  OCA  vs  0  placebo  in  the  restricted  indication  vs  3.0%  OCA  and  1.2%  in  the  overall  safety 
population)  in  the  restricted  PBC  population  is  noted,  with  lower  rates  of  serious  TEAEs  in  OCA.  The 
incidence  of  TEAEs  leading  to  death  remain  higher in  OCA:  3.0%OCA  vs  1.2%  placebo  in  the  overall 
population vs 1.2% OCA vs 0 placebo, but numbers are too limited to draw firm conclusion. The lower 
incidence of serious TEAEs in the restricted PBC population is not totally unexpected considering that 
most serious TEAEs are related to the severity and progression of the disease. By contrary, the incidence 
of severe TEAE (45.7%OCA vs 32.4% placebo), treatment related TEAEs (75.3%OCA vs 55.9% placebo), 
TEAE leading to IP withdrawal (33.3%OCA vs 26.5% placebo), to dose reductions (24.7% OCA vs 10.3% 
placebo),  dose  interruptions  (25.9%  OCA  vs  25.0%  placebo)  or  to  treatment  discontinuation  (14.8% 
OCA vs 19.1% placebo) do not show relevant changes compared to those reported for the overall safety 
population and most of them remain higher for OCA treated subjects, which is not totally reassuring. 
Incidence of thrombotic and cardiovascular disorders (6.2% OCA vs 2.9% placebo), renal AESI (9.9% 
OCA  vs  5.9%  placebo),  including  AKI  and  renal  failure  events,  cholelithiasis  (3.7%  OCA  vs  1.5% 
placebo), portal hypertensive gastropathy (3.7% OCA vs 0 placebo), DILI (2.5%OCA vs 0 placebo), liver 
transplant (1 case each in the early stage PBC population) or all-cause deaths (8 events in OCA vs 2 in 
placebo) are observed more frequently in OCA treated subjects compared to placebo treated patients 
even in the newly proposed subset of early stage PBC patients. The number of events are sometimes 
too limited to firmly conclude, but the imbalance observed in the overall safety population remains in 
this  restricted  early  stage  PBC  subset,  which  is  concerning.  Moreover,  treatment  is  associated  with 
significantly  high  incidences  of  pruritus  (81.5%  in  OCA  vs  47.1%  placebo,  which  lead  to  treatment 
interruption in 23.5% OCA subjects and pharmacological treatment in 54.3% in OCA vs 7.4% and 27.9%, 
respectively, in placebo), and gastrointestinal disorders (63% OCA vs 50% placebo), including higher 
rates of severe cases,  which have an important impact in patient´s health condition and that reflects 
an overall worse health condition in OCA treated subjects. A slightly higher frequency of fatigue was also 
observed in the OCA group (9.9% OCA vs 7.4% placebo). In addition, the similar rates of hepatic TEAEs 
observed in OCA and placebo treated subjects in the newly proposed early stage PBC population raise 
doubts on the actual benefit of treatment. 
RMM currently in place are considered insufficient. A thorough revision of the SmPC Section 4.4. and 4.8 
to properly reflect relevant risks is needed.  
In summary, even if an apparent less toxic safety profile is seen in this subset of PBC patients, still an 
increased toxicity and poor tolerability of OCA treatment is noted in the subset of patients with an early 
stage, mostly asymptomatic and slow progressive condition. Moreover, it is important to note that this 
population was not pre-specified but it is data driven and it is comprised by a low number of patients 
that hampers the interpretation of the reported results. In addition, the anticipated long-term exposure 
in clinical practice and difficulties to identify and exclude patients at increased risk of relevant events, 
add  further  concerns,  particularly  in  the  absence  of  a  demonstrated  clinical  benefit  in  changing  the 
disease progression.

Issue not solved, to be further followed up within the appropriate procedure.   
Question 11 
The high rate of severe TEAEs both in the general safety population (51.2% OCA vs 39.2% 
placebo) and in the subset of compensated patients (47.1% vs 36.4%) is noted. This is mainly 
driven  by  pruritus  TEAEs,  but  also  by  a  higher  rate  of  severe  gastrointestinal  disorders 
(oesophageal  varices  haemorrhage,  abdominal  pain,  vomiting,  melaena,  and  ascites), 
infections,  hepatobiliary  disorders  (hepatic  cirrhosis,  hepatic  failure),  acute  respiratory 
failure, back pain, and cerebrovascular accident are reported in OCA treated patients, which 
is  concerning.  The  MAH  is  invited  to  present  the  safety  profile  of severe  TEAEs  for  the  two 
subsets of patients with compensated and decompensated disease and discuss to what extent 
any differences at all would be expected. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The  MAH  assessed  the  frequency  of  events  between  OCA  and  placebo  in  the  overall,  compensated 
(indicated  per  current  SmPC),  and  decompensated  (contraindicated  per  current  SmPC)  populations. 
Given the subjects in these various groups have more advanced PBC disease and many of which are now 
contraindicated, the MAH has explored a more appropriate population that maximizes the benefit:risk 
profile. Therefore, the MAH has now proposed a revised SmPC population to contraindicate patients with 
compensated  cirrhosis  with  evidence  of  portal  hypertension  (PH)  and/or  hepatic  decompensation  at 
baseline.  
A  summary  of  severe  TEAEs  in  ≥2  overall  OCA-treated  subjects  by  SOC  and  PT  by  overall, 
decompensated  (contraindicated  per  current  SmPC),  compensated  (indicated  per  current  SmPC),  the 
proposed SmPC indicated, and proposed SmPC contraindicated populations is presented in Table 101.  
The incidence of severe TEAEs was higher in OCA-treated subjects with more advanced stage PBC (i.e., 
proposed SmPC contraindicated or decompensated [contraindicated per current SmPC] populations) than 
subjects with earlier stage PBC (i.e., proposed SmPC indicated or compensated [indicated per current 
SmPC] populations). Within earlier stage PBC, the incidence of severe TEAEs was higher for compensated 
OCA-treated  subjects  compared  to  proposed  SmPC  indicated  population  OCA-treated  subjects.  In  the 
proposed  SmPC  indicated  population,  the  majority  of  TEAEs  were  mild  or  moderate  across  treatment 
groups. With the exception of pruritus, individual PTs of severe TEAEs occurred in ≤2 subjects.  
Severe Gastrointestinal Disorders  
In  comparison  to  the  overall  population,  the  incidence  rate  of  the  severe  PTs  of  oesophageal  varices 
haemorrhage,  abdominal  pain,  melaena,  and  ascites  was  generally  balanced  in  the  proposed  SmPC 
indicated population:  
•  Oesophageal varices haemorrhage (none in the OCA group and 1.5% in the placebo group)  
•  Abdominal pain (1.2%) in the OCA group and 1.5% in the placebo group.  
• 
Melaena and ascites (none across treatment groups) 
Within the proposed SmPC indicated population, the only severe TEAE that occurred at a higher incidence 
in OCA-treated subjects (2.5%) compared to placebo-treated subjects (none) was vomiting. The severe 
TEAE of vomiting was assessed by the Investigator as unlikely, or not related to investigational product.  
Infections and infestations  
Severe  PTs  of  peritonitis  bacterial  and  sepsis  were  not  observed  in  the  proposed  SmPC  indicated 
population. In the overall population, the incidence rate was 1.2% for both events in the OCA group and 
none in the placebo group.  In the proposed SmPC indicated population, the incidence of severe PT of 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 271/319 
 
  
 
 
urinary tract infection was low and was higher in the OCA-treated subjects (2.5%) compared to placebo-
treated subjects (none).  
Hepatobiliary Disorders  
Severe  PTs  of  hepatic  cirrhosis  or  hepatic  failure  were  not  observed  in  the  proposed  SmPC  indicated 
subgroup. In the overall population, the incidence rate for both events was 1.2% in the OCA group and 
0.6% in the placebo group.  
Acute Respiratory Failure  
In the overall population, 2 (1.2%) subjects in the OCA group had severe TEAEs of acute respiratory 
failure:  1  subject  was  in  the  proposed  SmPC  indicated  population  and  1  subject  was  in  the  proposed 
SmPC contraindicated population. Both severe TEAEs of acute respiratory failure led to death and were 
considered not related or unlikely related to investigational product by the Investigator.  
•  One female subject with PBC in the proposed SmPC indicated and compensated populations died 
of  acute  respiratory  failure,  in  the  setting  of  Stage  4  B-cell  lymphoma  with  tumour  lysis 
syndrome,  on  10  Sep  2016  (Study  Day  317),  approximately  10  months  after the initiation  of 
OCA.  Investigational  product  was  withdrawn  in  response  to  the  events  of  lymphoma  and  AKI 
with the last dose administered on 20 Aug 2016 (Study Day 296). The death was considered not 
related to investigational product by the Investigator.  
• 
One male subjectwith PBC in the proposed SmPC contraindicated and compensated populations 
died of lower respiratory tract infection, with underlying influenza A and hospital acquired pneumonia, 
on 09 Feb 2017 (Study Day 183), approximately 6 months after the initiation of OCA. The subject’s last 
dose of investigational product was on 15 Dec 2016 (Study Day 127). The death was considered unlikely 
related to investigational product by the Investigator.  
Severe Back Pain  
In the overall population, 2 (1.2%) subjects in the OCA group had severe TEAEs of back pain: 1 subject 
was in proposed SmPC indicated population and 1 subject was in the contraindicated population. Both 
severe TEAEs of back pain were assessed by the Investigator as not related to investigational product.  
Severe Cerebrovascular Accident and TTP  
In the overall population, 2 (1.2%) subjects in the OCA group experienced severe TEAESIs of TTP and 1 
(1.2%)  subject  each  in  the  OCA  group  of  the  proposed  SmPC  indicated  and  proposed  SmPC 
contraindicated populations experienced a severe TEAESI of cerebrovascular accident. Of note, 2 events 
of TTP in 2 subjects in the OCA group were captured in the SMQ search criteria for both CV and renal 
TEAESIs.  However,  since  the  underlying  pathophysiology  for  TTP  is  not  related  to  atherosclerotic 
mechanisms, the TTP cases are discussed under renal TEAESIs.  
•  A female subject with PBC in proposed SmPC indicated population reported a serious TEAESI of 
TTP on 06 Jun 2016 (Study Day 111), approximately 4 months after the initiation of OCA. The 
patient began rifampicin approximately 3 months after the initiation of OCA, and it was ongoing 
at the time of the event. Investigational product was initially interrupted and later withdrawn in 
response to the event. The peak creatinine documented following the diagnosis of TTP was 1.5 
mg/dl. The event was considered resolved with sequelae (plasmapheresis [as needed]) on 09 
Jul 2016 (Study Day 144). The Investigator assessed the event of TTP as severe and not related 
to investigational product.  
•  One female subject with PBC in proposed SmPC indicated population reported serious TEAESIs 
of TTP and cerebrovascular accident on 10 Oct 2019 (Study Day 441), approximately 1 year and 
3  months  after  the  initiation  of  OCA.  While  the  subject  was  in  the  proposed  SmPC  indicated 
EMA/528620/2023

population when she began OCA, she had an elastography score of 16.5 kPa measured on 29 
Jan 2019 (Study Day 187) which may be outside of the proposed population description. The 
subject  presented  to  the  emergency  department  several  months  later  for  evaluation  and 
admitted  to  the  intensive  care  unit  with  the  diagnosis  of  sub-acute  stroke  (serious  TEAESI  of 
cerebrovascular accident) and subsequently confirmed a diagnosis of TTP with disintegrin and 
metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs activity noted at 2%. Investigational product was 
withdrawn  in  response  to  the  events  of  cerebrovascular  accident  and  TTP.  The  event  of 
cerebrovascular accident was considered resolved on 26 Oct 2019 (Study Day 457) and TTP was 
considered resolved on 04 Dec 2019 (Study Day 496). Both events were considered severe and 
unlikely related to investigational product.  
Examining the two cases of TTP that occurred in subjects receiving OCA, 1 had ongoing treatment with 
rifampicin at the time of the event. Rifampicin has a reported association with TTP (Hamad 2020, Fahal 
1992, Gupta 2005). The second subject with TTP was likely idiopathic, which is consistent with current 
understanding (Joly 2017).

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
A  summary  of  severe  TEAEs  in  ≥2  overall  OCA-treated  subjects  by  overall,  decompensated 
(contraindicated  per  current  SmPC),  compensated  (indicated  per  current  SmPC),  as  requested,  is 
provided. In addition, these events are presented for the new proposed SmPC indicated, and proposed 
SmPC  contraindicated  populations.  Not  unexpectedly,  these  data  show  that  the  incidence  of  severe 
TEAEs  was  higher  in  OCA-treated  subjects  with  more  advanced  stage  PBC  (i.e.,  proposed  SmPC 
contraindicated or decompensated [contraindicated per current SmPC] populations) than in subjects with 
earlier  stage  PBC  (i.e.,  proposed  SmPC  indicated  or  compensated  [indicated  per  current  SmPC] 
populations). Within earlier stage PBC, contrary to the MAH´s claim, the incidence of severe TEAEs was 
roughly  similar  for  compensated  OCA-treated  subjects  and  for  the  newly  proposed  SmPC  indicated 
population OCA-treated subjects overall (47.1% vs 45.7%, respectively) and this was the case for the 
majority of severe individual TEAEs. The only exception is a numerical decrease in the incidence of severe 
GI  TEAEs  (11.8%  vs  8.6%  for  compensated  per  current  SmPC  or  proposed  SmPC,  respectively)  and 
hepatobiliary disorders (4.4% vs 1.2%), of uncertain meaning. Nevertheless, even in the mildest PBC 
population, as defined by the newly proposed indication, there is an increased risk of severe TEAEs in 
OCA treated patients vs placebo treated patient overall (45.7%OCA vs 32.4%placebo), mostly driven by 
TEAEs like pruritus (32.1%OCA vs 11.8%placebo), GI disorders (8.6% vs 4.4%), infections (4.9% vs 
2.9%), and hepatobiliary disorders (1.2% OCA vs 0 placebo).  
Issue solved.  The  information  requested  has  been  provided.  Even  if  a  more  benign  safety  profile  is 
observed in a milder subset of the PBC population, this is a non-prespecified, data driven analysis, and 
as such it should be interpreted with caution.  
Question 12 
Renal AESIs were also reported more frequently in patients treated with OCA, both for the 
overall  safety  population  (17  (10.1%)  subjects  in  the  OCA  and  13  (7.8%)  subjects  in  the 
placebo groups, with acute kidney injury reported by 3.0 % in OCA vs 1.2% in placebo treated 
EMA/528620/2023

patients), and for the subset of patients with compensated disease (8.8% OCA-treated and 
6.2% placebo-treated patients experienced a renal AESI, with acute kidney injury reported 
by 2.2% in OCA and 1.6% in placebo treated patients). In addition, it has been reported that 
exposure to OCA was associated with a small reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(eGFR) in a NASH clinical study. The higher incidence of renal events in patients treated with 
OCA regardless of the severity of the underlying liver disease is worrisome. Please discuss.  
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Renal TEAESIs  
The  MAH  evaluated  renal  TEAESIs  in  OCA-treated  subjects  from  Study  747-302  and  post-marketing 
data. From the totality of these analyses, the MAH concluded there is no increased risk of acute kidney 
injury (AKI) in the proposed SmPC indicated population.  
•  Study  747-302:  The  incidence  of  AKI  in  the  proposed  SmPC  indicated  population  was  lower 
compared to the overall and compensated populations. The PT of AKI was reported in 1 subject 
in  the  OCA  group,  which  was  considered  not  related  to  investigational  product  by  the 
Investigator.  
o  Upon subject-level review, the majority of subjects with the renal TEAESIs had serum 
creatinine levels within normal ranges. 
•  Ocaliva  Postmarketing  Data:  Cumulatively,  from  over  35,000  patient-years  exposure  from 
marketing experience, there has been no increased risk of AKI.  
Mean eGFR  
No  clinically  significant  changes  overtime  or  across  treatment  groups  were  observed  with  respect  to 
eGFR or serum creatinine in 3 long-term, double-blinded, placebo-controlled studies in patients with liver 
fibrosis due to NASH (Study 747-303, FLINT, and 2001).  
Similar  results  were  observed  in  Study  747-302.  Within  4  years  of  treatment,  no  clinically  significant 
changes in mean eGFR values over time or across treatment groups were observed with respect to eGFR 
in  the  overall  population,  as  well  as  in  the  compensated  and  proposed  SmPC  indicated  populations. 
Interpretation of data at later timepoints (Month 48 and beyond) was limited due to fewer observations 
in each treatment group.  
Study 747-302: Renal TEAESIs  
Renal  TEAESIs  are  summarized  overall,  decompensated  (contraindicated  per  current  SmPC), 
compensated  (indicated  per  current  SmPC),  the  proposed  SmPC  indicated,  and  proposed  SmPC 
contraindicated populations in Table 102. A listing of subjects with treatment-emergent AKI is presented 
in Table 103.  
The incidence of renal TEAESIs was higher in OCA-treated subjects with more advanced stage PBC (i.e., 
proposed SmPC contraindicated or decompensated [contraindicated per current SmPC] populations) than 
subjects with earlier stage PBC (i.e., proposed SmPC indicated or compensated [indicated per current 
SmPC]  populations).  Within  earlier  stage  PBC,  the  incidence  of  renal  TEAESIs  was  higher  for 
compensated OCA-treated subjects compared to proposed SmPC indicated OCA-treated subjects. In the 
proposed SmPC indicated population, with the exception of TTP, individual renal TEAESIs occurred in 1 
subject each.  
Renal TEAESIs were defined as events included in the following broad SMQs: acute renal failure, chronic 
kidney disease, proteinuria, renovascular disorders, or tubulointerstitial diseases.  
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 275/319 
 
  
 
 
The following groups were coded under renal TEAESI and represent a heterogeneous group of conditions 
with different mechanisms of change or injury: 
Acute Kidney Injury  
The incidence of AKI in the proposed SmPC indicated population was lower compared to the overall and 
compensated populations. Except for 1 subject all subjects who experienced a renal TEAESI of AKI were 
in the proposed SmPC contraindicated population (4 [4.6%] subjects in the OCA group and 2 [2.0%] 
subjects in the placebo group). The subject in the proposed SmPC indicated population who had an AKI 
is briefly discussed below. The Investigator considered the event as a non-serious TEAE and not related 
to investigational product.  
•  One female subject twith PBC was referred to the emergency room on 20 Aug 2016 (Study Day 
296)  for  evaluation  of  moderate  left  upper  quadrant  abdominal  pain  (non-serious  AE).  On  23 
Aug  2016  (Study  Day  299),  the  subject  was  hospitalized  with  the  diagnosis  of  Stage  4  B-cell 
lymphoma  (SAE)  with  renal/breast/lung/central  nervous  system  involvement.  The  metastatic 
disease was thought to have originated from the right kidney. On the same day, the subject was 
diagnosed reported to have with “acute kidney injury” on the basis of an elevated serum urea 
level but otherwise normal renal function tests (note: urea is commonly elevated in metastatic 
lymphoma  patients).  Investigational  product  was  withdrawn  in  response  to  the  events  of 
lymphoma and acute kidney injury (AKI), with the last dose administered on 20 Aug 2016 (Study 
Day 296). The Investigator assessed the event of lymphoma as severe and AKI as moderate in 
severity.  On  03  Sept  2016  (Study  Day  310),  the  subject  completed  the  first  cycle  of 
chemotherapy (R-EPOCH). On 05 Sep 2016 (Study Day 312), the subject was transferred to the 
intensive care unit as she developed acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (SAE) and subsequently 
intubated due to worsening hypoxia and respiratory distress on 09 Sep 2016 (Study Day 316). 
Additional  diagnoses  were  tumour  lysis  syndrome,  and  pancytopenia  with  neutropenia.  The 
subject’s family decided to pursue comfort care and the subject was extubated and died due to 
the event of acute respiratory failure on the same day. The events of lymphoma, AKI, and the 
fatal event of acute respiratory failure were all considered not related to investigational product 
by the Investigator.  
Other Renal TEAESIs  
With the exception of TTP, all other renal TEAESIs in OCA-treated subjects were mild to moderate in 
severity.  The  renal  TEAESIs  of  TTP  in  the  proposed  SmPC  indicated  population  are  briefly  discussed 
below. None of the cases were considered related to investigational product.  
•  One female subject tpresented to hospital with confusion and a syncope having been severely 
thrombocytopenic for at least 27 days prior to the presentation. The TESAE of TTP was diagnosed 
on 06 Jun 2016 (Study Day 111), approximately 4 months after the initiation of OCA. The patient 
began rifampicin approximately 3 months after the initiation of OCA, and it was ongoing at the 
time  of  the  event.  Investigational  product  was  initially  interrupted  and  later  withdrawn  in 
response to the event. The peak creatinine documented following the diagnosis of TTP was mildly 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 276/319 
 
  
 
 
 
elevated  at  1.5  mg/dL  (reference  range:  0.6-1.3).  The  subject  was  treated  with  steroids, 
plasmapheresis  and  Rituximab.  The  event  was  considered  resolved  with  sequelae 
(plasmapheresis [as needed]) on 09 Jul 2016 (Study Day 144). The Investigator assessed the 
event of TTP as severe and not related to investigational product.  
•  One female subject tPBC reported serious TEAESIs of cerebrovascular accident and TTP on 10 
Oct 2019 (Study Day 441), approximately 1 year and 3 months after the initiation of OCA. While 
the  subject  was  programmatically  assigned  to  the  proposed  SmPC  indicated  population  upon 
initiation  of  OCA,  elastography  score  of  16.5  kPa  was  measured  on  29  Jan  2019  (Study  Day 
187). On 10 Oct 2019 (Study Day 441) the subject presented to the emergency department for 
evaluation and was admitted to the intensive care unit with the diagnosis of sub-acute stroke 
(serious TEAESI of cerebrovascular accident) and subsequently a confirmed a diagnosis of TTP 
with  disintegrin  and  metalloproteinase  with  thrombospondin  motifs  activity  noted  low  at  2%. 
Investigational product was withdrawn in response to the events of cerebrovascular accident and 
TTP. The event of cerebrovascular accident was considered resolved on 26 Oct 2019 (Study Day 
457)  and  TTP  was  considered  resolved  on  04  Dec  2019  (Study  Day  496).  Both  events  were 
considered severe and unlikely related to investigational product.  
Examining the two cases of TTP that occurred in subjects receiving OCA, 1 had ongoing treatment with 
rifampicin at the time of the event. Rifampicin has a reported association with TTP (Hamad 2020, Fahal 
1992, Gupta 2005). The second subject with TTP was likely idiopathic, which is consistent with current 
understanding (Joly 2017).  
One event of renal failure was reported in 1 OCA-treated subject (non-serious) and one event of diabetic 
nephropathy (non-serious) in the proposed SmPC indicated population. These events were considered 
mild and not related to investigational product by the Investigator.  
•  One female subject with PBC and a history of pruritus, initiated OCA study treatment on 13 Jan 
2017.  The  subject’s  serum  creatinine  at  baseline  on  12  Jan  2018  was  0.87  mg/dL  (reference 
range: 0.51 – 0.96 mg/dL). On 23 Feb 2018 (D42), the subject experienced an episode of severe 
pruritus and was maintained rifampicin, phenobarbital, and cholestyramine with the addition of 
bezafibrate. On 11 Jul 2018 (D180), a serum creatinine value of 0.92 mg/dL was reported for 
the subject a MELD score of 6.4. Approximately 8 months after the initiation of OCA, the subject 
discontinued  study  treatment  on  21  Aug  2018  (D221),  the  same  day  she  was  admitted  for  a 
planned liver transplantation due to intractable pruritus. On 03 Sept 2018 (D234), the subject 
underwent  a  successful  liver  transplantation  without  complication  and  was  initiated  on 
treatments  with 
tacrolimus,  mycophenolate  mofetil, 
sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, 
valganciclovir hydrochloride, prednisone, and magnesium hydroxide. Subsequently, an event of 
renal failure was recorded on 17 Sept 2018 (D248) having discontinued bezafibrate treatment 
shortly  before  on  14  Sept  2018  (D245).  At  the  onset  of  the  renal  failure  event,  the  subject 
reported the concurrent AEs of anaemia, chills, constipation, diarrhoea, and oral candidiasis. The 
subject remained on hydrochlorothiazide, tacrolimus, and sulfamethoxazole through the event 
of renal failure. On 18 Oct 2018 (D279), a peak serum creatinine value of 1.20 mg/dL (reference 
range:  0.51  –  0.96  mg/dL)  was  reported.  The  subject  withdrew  from  the  study  18  Oct  2018 
(D279).  
• 
 One  male  subject  with  PBC  and  a  history  of  pruritus,  type  1  diabetes  mellitus  (insulin 
dependent), and hypertension (on hydrochlorothiazide since 2006) initiated OCA study treatment 
on 05 Dec 2016. Serum creatinine at baseline on 02 Dec 2016 was 1.02 mg/dL (reference range: 
0.67 – 1.17 mg/dL). On 12 Dec 2016 the subject was reported to have a moderate increase in 
blood pressure determined by the investigator to be unlikely related to study treatment and the 
subject was initiated on amlodipine the same day after discontinuing hydrochlorothiazide on 11 
EMA/528620/2023

Dec 2016. Due to excessive pain of the cervical and thoracic spine, the subject initiated celecoxib 
and diclofenac sodium on 30 Nov 2017 before discontinuing these therapies on 10 Dec 2017. On 
07  April  2018  the  subject  initiated  ibuprofen  and  pseudoephedrine  for  acute  frontal  sunisitis 
before discontinuing these therapies on 07 May 2018. The subject was administered diclofenac 
sodium and meloxicam transiently in for spine pain in Aug 2018. On 11 Sept 2019, the subject 
had a serum creatinine level of 1.22 mg/dL (reference range: 0.67 – 1.17 mg/dL). Subsequently, 
the  subject  experienced  an  event  of  mild  diabetic  nephropathy  on  09  Dec  2019,  which  the 
investigator determined was not related to study treatment. The subject had insulin-dependent 
type 1 diabetes mellitus at the time of study enrollment per reported medical history (unknown 
onset date). The presence of proteinuria was not provided. On 09 Dec 2019, the subject had a 
serum creatinine level of 1.28 mg/dL (reference range: 0.67 – 1.17 mg/dL). The subject was 
administered meloxicam for spine pain in Sept 2019. Peak serum creatinine was observed on 17 
Dec 2020 of 1.54 mg/dL. The subject discontinued study treatment on 01 Dec 2021 due to study 
termination by the MAH.

Renal  TEAESI  events  in  the  proposed  SmPC  indicated  population  are  presented  in  Table  104.  Renal 
events are not uncommon in patients with advanced chronic liver disease. These patients are predisposed 
due  to  the  profound  haemodynamic  changes  that  occur  in  cirrhosis  with  developing  and  established 
portal hypertension. It is therefore important to analyse the renal events (AESI) that manifested as renal 
impairment (elevated serum creatinine/decreased eGFR). The most common causes for renal impairment 
in cirrhotic patients are: 1) AKI due to hypovolaemia (e.g., variceal haemorrhage or diuretics) or due to 
medications that impair renal blood flow (NSAIDs, ARBs, ACEi) and 2) hepatorenal syndrome (type 1 
and type 2), which is related to portal hypertension and hypoperfusion of the kidneys. This highlights 
the importance of considering the effects of factors on renal hemodynamics that alter the ability of the 
kidneys to function at full capacity and the scenario of injury of renal cells.  
As previously discussed, the etiology of TTP is one of an enzyme deficiency within endothelial cells that 
causes diffuse small vessel thrombosis. This is clinically different from the presence of white cells in the 
urine and red cells in the urine (leukocyturia and hematuria) which arguably while part of a class that is 
grouped  with other  events  that  are  associated  with the  kidneys  can  also  results  from  infection in the 
bladder and other issues related to the collecting system. Table 104 presents the individual terms with 
creatinine to reflect the baseline and peak following the event so that the multiple etiologies (in terms 
of mechanism such as infection and organ such as kidney or collecting system) may be considered.  
The majority of the renal TEAESIs that occurred in the proposed SmPC indicated population occurred 
when serum creatinine levels were within normal ranges. A total of 5 total subjects had abnormal serum 
creatinine values at the time of the renal TEAESI (3 subjects in the OCA group and 2 subjects in the 
placebo  group).  Of  the  3  subjects  in  the  OCA  group,  1  subject  experienced  renal  failure  after  liver 
transplantation  while  on  anti-rejection  medication,  1  subject  had  renal  impairment  due  to  the

development of TTP, and 1 subject had a pre-existing condition of insulin-dependent Type 1 diabetes 
mellitus.

Study 747-302: Renal Function Biochemical Analysis  
Mean (SE) eGFR values over time for each study visit are summarized for the overall population in Figure 
40. Mean values and mean (SE) change from baseline in eGFR are presented in Table 105 by overall and 
baseline disease severity for the safety population at Baseline, Month 3, Month 12, Month 24, Month 36, 
and Month 48.  
Within  the  first  4  years  of  treatment,  no  clinically  significant  changes  over  time  or  across  treatment 
groups  were  observed  with  respect  to  eGFR  in  the  overall  population,  as  well  as  based  on  disease 
severity.  
Shifts from baseline to post-baseline visits in chronic kidney disease stage are summarized for the overall 
population in Table 106, Month 3, Month 12, Month 24, Month 36, and Month 48. The majority of subjects 
in both placebo and OCA groups were CKD stage 1 at baseline, with approximately 20% of subjects in 
both groups CKD stage 2 at baseline. No subjects were CKD stage 3b, 4, or 5 at baseline.  
Within the first 4 years of treatment, no clinically significant shifts over time in CKD stage were observed 
in either treatment group.  
Interpretation of data at later timepoints (Month 48 and beyond) is limited due to fewer observations in 
each treatment group.

Ocaliva Post-marketing Data: Renal PTs  
OCA was granted accelerated approval under the trade name Ocaliva by the US FDA on 27 May 2016, 
and received conditional approval by the European Commission on 12 Dec 2016, by Health Canada on 
24 May 2017, and is now approved in 43 countries for the treatment of PBC in combination with UDCA 
in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA or as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA. As 
of May 2023, the estimated cumulative global patient-years exposure from marketing experience is over 
35,000 patient-years. No increased risk of renal events has been observed in the post-marketing setting.  
Cumulatively, since marketing approval in 2016, 204 renal reports which included 279 renal events have 
been reported. The most frequent adverse events reported were PTs of blood creatinine abnormal (26), 
renal  failure  (25),  AKI  (23),  renal  impairment  (13),  glomerular  filtration  rate  abnormal  (11),  blood 
creatinine increased (11), and blood urea abnormal (11).  
Nine renal cases with a fatal outcome were reported. All except 2 of these cases were assessed as not 
related  or  unlikely  related  to  Ocaliva,  and  the  remaining  2  cases  which  were  assessed  as  related  to 
Ocaliva were both from patients with advanced PBC disease who would now be contraindicated per the 
current SmPC. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The higher incidence of renal events in patients treated with OCA regardless of the severity of the 
underlying liver disease is worrisome, and the Company was requested to discuss on this finding. In 
response, the Company presented renal TEAESIs in OCA-treated subjects in Study 747-302 by overall, 
decompensated (contraindicated per current SmPC), compensated (indicated per current SmPC), 
proposed SmPC and proposed contraindicated populations, changes in renal function over a 4-year 
period in the same study, as well as post-marketing data. According to the Company, none of the 
NASH studies showed a decrease in eGFR over time while on OCA treatment.  
Contrary to the Company´s claim, the incidence of renal TEASIs remains rather consistent across OCA-
treated subjects in the overall study population (10.1%), and in subjects with earlier stage PBC both 
compensated (per current SmPC) (8.8%) and proposed SmPC indicated (9.9%), but it is lower than in 
decompensated subjects currently contraindicated per SmPC (15.6%). It is also noted that 
systematically, the incidence of renal TEASIs, including renal events that manifest as renal 
impairment, is numerically higher in OCA treated group vs placebo-groups regardless of the PBC 
population analysed, i.e., the overall study population or any of the restricted subsets of milder PBC 
subjects. A partial analysis of the renal TEASIs, restricted to the newly proposed restricted PBC target 
population, indicate that in most of these events there were no parallel changes in creatinine levels or 
eGFR decline over time. However, in 5 out these 12 cases, changes in renal function parameters were 
observed (3 OCA vs 2 placebo). In any case, focusing the discussion of renal events to those occurring 
only in a small portion of the actual studied population does not help to assess the safety concern 
properly. Indeed, overall data provided do not allow excluding the potential role of OCA in the 
EMA/528620/2023

observed increased incidence of renal TEASIs. Furthermore, given the differences in exposure, actual 
incidence of the events corrected by exposure time might have contributed to the interpretation of the 
phase 3 data. In this context, post marketing data provided do not alleviate the concern. Since 
marketing approval in 2016, 204 renal reports which included 279 renal events have been reported 
and the most frequent adverse events reported were PTs of blood creatinine abnormal (26), renal 
failure (25), AKI (23), renal impairment (13), glomerular filtration rate abnormal (11), blood creatinine 
increased (11), and blood urea abnormal. Nine renal cases with a fatal outcome were reported. All 
except 2 of these cases were assessed as not related or unlikely related to Ocaliva, and the remaining 
2 cases which were assessed as related to Ocaliva were both from patients with advanced PBC disease 
who would now be contraindicated per the current SmPC. 
In conclusion, based on the existing evidence a possible association between OCA treatment and the 
occurrence of renal TEASI events, including severe, serious, and fatal events, cannot be ruled out. 
Incidence rates adjusted by exposure time for the relevant renal TEASI events should be provided. A 
discussion, on the need to update current information in the SmPC Sections 4.4 and 4.8, and a 
proposal, is requested.  
Issue not solved, but not further followed up within this procedure. Incidence rates adjusted 
by exposure time for the relevant renal TEASI events were not provided. Based on the overall evidence 
available, a discussion on the need to update current information in the SmPC Sections 4.4 and 4.8, 
and a proposal may be needed.  
Question 13 
When  discussing  the  incidence  of  liver  transplant  and  deaths  events  (adjudicated  by  an 
Hepatic  Outcome  Committee,  HSAC),  the  information  provided  is  quite  confusing  given  the 
number  of  analyses  conducted  and  lack  of  tabulated  results,  but  all  point  into  the  same 
direction: a total of 60 liver transplants and deaths in patients overall were retrospectively 
adjudicated in a blinded manner by the HSAC ( ITT population=32 (19.0%) subjects OCA vs 
28 (16.9%) placebo, considered possibly treatment related in 12.5% OCA vs 3.6% placebo), 
less than half occurred in patients with decompensated liver disease (26), and the remaining 
34  occurred  in  patients  with  compensated  disease  (20  in  OCA  vs  14  in  placebo).  This  is 
considered  a  matter  of  major  concern,  given  that  the  aim  of  OCA  treatment  is  just  the 
opposite,  to  prevent  these  clinical  outcomes.  The  MAH  is  invited  to  provide  these  results, 
tabulated,  for  the  overall  study  population,  for  the  subset  of  patients  with  compensated 
disease  and  also  for  patients  with  decompensated  conditions,  and  discuss  on  the  clinical 
relevance  of  these  findings  in  the  compensated  population  bearing  in  mind  that  the 
demonstrated benefit of OCA treatment is limited to ALP reductions. The appropriateness of 
the current risk minimization measures deserves further discussion in view of these results. 
Further, the MAH should explain the differences observed in the incidence of liver transplant 
and deaths adjudicated events between the safety population and the ITT population.  
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The MAH recognizes the significant imbalance in liver transplant and death events in Study 747-302. In 
the proposed SmPC indicated population: 7 subjects had a liver transplant, and 4 subjects had an all-
cause death (11 total events) in the OCA group; 1 subject had a liver transplant and 1 subject had an 
all-cause death (2 total events) in the placebo group.  
A comprehensive evaluation of liver transplant and death events in the 11 OCA-treated subjects and 2 
placebo subjects was performed to assess the potential increased risk with OCA:  
•  Of  the  11  subjects  in  the  OCA  group,  a  total  of  1  subject  had  an  event  that  was  considered 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 286/319 
 
  
 
 
possibly related to investigational product by an independent, blinded adjudication by an HSAC. 
Based on an ultrasound showing significant splenomegaly and an endoscopy report which was 
equivocal for oesophageal varices, there is a suspicion (or suggestion) one subject  had portal 
hypertension at baseline and would have been contraindicated per proposed SmPC.  
• 
The remainder of liver transplant and death events within proposed SmPC indicated population 
were adjudicated as unlikely related to investigational product.  
•  Upon subject-level review of Study 747-302, the majority of liver transplants and all-cause death 
events in the proposed SmPC indicated population had alternate diagnoses/comorbidities.  
• 
The  incidence  of  liver  transplants  and  deaths  in  the  placebo  group  from  Study  747-302  was 
substantially  lower  than  any  of  the  other  non-OCA  treated  groups  from  real  world  datasets. 
Meanwhile, the liver transplant and death event rates were consistent across real world datasets.  
− Real-world evidence (RWE) datasets  
− Over 35,000 patient-years of Ocaliva postmarketing exposure in PBC  
Based on totality of assessments, the MAH concludes that the rate of liver transplant and death events 
in Study 747-302 was not consistent with postmarketing and real-world datasets, previous PBC studies, 
and external control studies.  
Study 747-302: Blinded Adjudication by HSAC  
All  liver  transplant  and  death  events  were  adjudicated  in  an  independent,  blinded  manner  by  HSAC. 
Adjudicated  liver  transplants  and  deaths  by  blinded  HSAC  causality  assessment  are  summarized  in 
overall, decompensated (contraindicated per current SmPC), compensated (indicated per current SmPC), 
the proposed SmPC indicated, and proposed SmPC contraindicated populations in Table 107.  
The  incidence of  liver transplant  and deaths  was  higher  in  OCA-treated  subjects  with  more  advanced 
stage PBC (i.e., proposed SmPC contraindicated or decompensated [contraindicated per current SmPC] 
populations)  than  subjects  with  earlier  stage  PBC  (i.e.,  proposed  SmPC  indicated  or  compensated 
[indicated per current SmPC] populations). The incidence of liver transplants and deaths was higher for 
OCA-treated subjects in the compensated population (20 subjects) compared to OCA-treated subjects 
in the proposed SmPC indicated population (11 subjects).  
In the compensated (indicated per current SmPC) population, there were 20 subjects in the OCA group 
(13 liver transplants and 7 all-cause deaths) and 14 subjects in the placebo group (7 liver transplants 
and 7 all-cause deaths).  
In  the  proposed  SmPC  indicated  population,  there  were  a  total  of  11  subjects  in  the  OCA  group  (7 
subjects had a liver transplant and 4 subjects had an all-cause death); and a total of 2 subjects in the 
placebo group (1 subject had a liver transplant and 1 subject had an all-cause death).  
The  majority  of  the  liver  transplants  and  deaths  in  the  proposed  SmPC  indicated  population  were 
considered unlikely related to investigational product by the HSAC. Upon additional subject-level review, 
the majority of the subjects with a liver transplant or death in the proposed SmPC indicated population 
had alternate underlying diseases and/or causes which may have contributed to the outcome. A listing 
of  liver  transplant  and  all-cause  deaths  in  subjects  in  the  proposed  SmPC  indicated  population  is 
presented in Table 108.  
One  subject  in  the  OCA  group  had  a  liver  transplant  that  was  considered  possibly  related  to 
investigational product by the HSAC. Based on an ultrasound prior to study initiation showing significant 
splenomegaly  and  an  endoscopy  report  which  was  equivocal  for  oesophageal  varices,  there  is  a 
suggestion that the subject had portal hypertension at baseline and would have been contraindicated 
per proposed SmPC.  
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 287/319 
 
  
 
 
The remainder of liver transplant and death events within the proposed SmPC indicated population were 
adjudicated as unlikely related to investigational product by the HSAC.  
•  One  female  subjectwith  AMA  negative  PBC  and  a  medical  history  of  alcohol  use  disorder  and 
severe chronic pancreatitis with endocrine and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, underwent an 
allogenic liver transplant on 13 Feb 2020 (Study Day 639), approximately 1 year and 3 months 
after the discontinuation of OCA. There was an ultrasound prior to study initiation with significant 
splenomegaly and an endoscopy report which was equivocal for oesophageal varices, suggesting 
that  the  subject  may  have  had  portal  hypertension  at  baseline  and  would  have  been 
contraindicated per proposed SmPC. Investigational product had been permanently discontinued 
approximately 6 months after the initiation due to mild ALT and AST elevation. Rifampicin was a 
concomitant  medication  at  that  time.  Liver  transplantation  was  performed  due  to  progressive 
deterioration in synthetic liver function. Liver transplantation was challenging with severe fibrotic 
changes of the biliary tree and the retroperitoneum suspicious of primary sclerosing cholangitis 
("absurd intraabdominal conditions" as per surgical theatre report). Explant histology was not 
available

UK PBC, Global PBC, Komodo, Italian PBC Datasets  
Due  to  significant  bias  observed  in  Study  747-302,  particularly  in  the  placebo  group  (i.e.,  functional 
unblinding, informative censoring, and initiation of rescue therapy while on study), the interpretation of 
liver transplant and death event rates in Study 747-302 may be of limited value; differential dropout 
rates were observed between the treatment groups, with more subjects in the placebo group initiating 
PBC  rescue  therapy  while  on  study.  However,  it  was  important  to  thoroughly  evaluate  the  observed 
imbalance in liver transplant and death rates in Study 747-302. The MAH undertook 2 additional analyses 
to investigate this imbalance:  
1. A comparison of the placebo group in the proposed SmPC indicated population in Study 747-302 real-
world non-OCA treated patients with PBC, to understand the observed event rate relative to the known 
natural history of PBC.  
2. An analysis of liver transplants in the US transplant registry before and after launch of commercial 
OCA, as the observed significant imbalance in liver transplants associated with OCA would manifest as 
increased transplants in the real world.  
The first analysis compared the observed liver transplant and death event rates in the placebo group in 
the  proposed  SmPC  indicated  population  with  non-OCA  treated  patients  with  PBC  from  real  world 
datasets:  
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 289/319 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
•  Study  747-301  (POISE)  external  controls:  UK  PBC  (>6900  patients)  and  Global  PBC  (>6000 
patients) registries  
•  Study 747-405 (HEROES) fully real-world analysis: Komodo Health claims database (>100,000 
patients)  
•  RECAPITULATE fully real-world analysis: Consolidated Italian PBC Registry  
The eligibility criteria were similar across Study 747-302 and external control and real-world analyses, 
but  it  is  important  to  note  that  enrolled  subjects  in  Study  747-302  had  more  advanced  disease  at 
baseline.  Mean  ALP levels  at  baseline  in the  placebo  group  in  proposed  SmPC  indicated  population  in 
Study 747-302 (620 U/L) was more than twice the baseline mean ALP levels of any of the other non-
OCA treated groups (224 U/L to 292 U/L).  
Time  to  death  or  liver  transplant  in  the  placebo  group  of  the  proposed  SmPC  indicated  population  in 
Study 747-302 and non-OCA treated patients with PBC from external controls (UK PBC and Global PBC), 
Study 747-405, and RECAPITULATE are shown in Figure 41.  
•  Despite having more advanced disease, the incidence of liver transplants and deaths in the 
placebo group from Study 747-302 was substantially lower than any of the other non-OCA 
treated  groups  from  real  world  datasets.  Meanwhile,  the  liver  transplant  and death  event 
rates were consistent across the non-OCA treated groups.  
•  None  of  the  liver  transplants  and/or  deaths  in  the  placebo  group  from  Study  747-302 
occurred in the first year. However, liver transplants and/or deaths in the non-OCA treated 
groups from real world datasets had approximately 10-times the event rate at 6 years versus 
the placebo group from Study 747-302.  
In comparison to the non-OCA treated patients with PBC from real-world datasets, the liver transplants 
and  death  event  rate  in  the  placebo  group  of  Study  747-302  is  epidemiologically  and  medically 
implausible considering that the subjects enrolled had more advanced disease at baseline. 
The second analysis compared the number of liver transplants performed in patients with PBC before 
and after the launch of commercial OCA in the real world setting to investigate if there was an increased 
risk of liver transplants after the launch of commercial OCA.  
The number of liver transplants and the percentage of total liver transplants in patients with PBC before 
and  after  the  launch  of  commercial  OCA  in  the  US  from  the  comprehensive  Organ  Procurement  and 
Transplant Network national registry is shown in Figure 42.  
EMA/528620/2023

Ocaliva was approved in the US in May 2016. In 2015, there were 7127 total liver transplants in patients 
with  PBC  in  the  US.  The  total  number  of  liver  transplants  increased  to  7811  in  2016,  and  steadily 
increased to 9234 by 2021. There was no clear increase in liver transplants in patients with PBC after 
OCA  commercial  launch  in  Jun  2016,  despite  the  number  of  OCA-treated  patients  increasing  to  over 
3500 per  year,  with  >30,0000  years of  accumulating  post-marketing treatment exposure  during  that 
period.  Remarkably,  the  percentage  of  liver  transplants  associated  with  PBC  has  decreased  slightly 
overtime. 
In summary, the observed imbalance in liver transplants and deaths in Study 747-302 was not valid and 
reflected significant bias, particularly in favor of the placebo group.  
• 
The liver transplants and death event rates observed in the placebo group in Study 747-302 did 
not  reflect  the  high  event  rates  seen  in  real-world  analyses,  which  was  consistent  in  multiple  larger 
datasets.  
• 
The liver transplant event rates observed in the OCA group in Study 747-302 was not consistent 
with  the  rates  seen  over  time  in  a  comprehensive  liver  transplant  national  registry.  Remarkably,  the 
percentage  of  liver  transplants  associated  with  PBC  has  decreased  slightly  over  time  despite  the 
increasing number of patient-exposure years of OCA in the post-marketing setting.  
Ocaliva Post-marketing Data: Liver Transplants and Liver-related Deaths  
OCA was granted accelerated approval under the trade name Ocaliva by the US FDA on 27 May 2016, 
and received conditional approval by the European Commission on 12 Dec 2016, by Health Canada on 
24 May 2017, and is now approved in 43 countries for the treatment of PBC in combination with UDCA 
in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA or as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA. As 
of May 2023, the estimated cumulative global patient-years exposure from marketing experience is over 
35,000 patient-years.  
No increased risk of liver transplant or deaths has been observed in the post-marketing setting.  
Cumulatively,  since  marketing  approval  in  2016,  47  fatal  reports  due  to  hepatic  events  have  been 
reported, and the majority were reported from patients who would now be contraindicated by the current 
SmPC. Cumulatively, 33 reports of liver transplants (31 with PT of liver transplant, and 2 with PT of liver 
transplant rejection) have been reported.

Analysis Populations in Study 747-302  
All  subjects  were  included  in  the  efficacy  and  safety  analyses  using  the  ITT  population  and  safety 
population,  respectively.  Both  the  ITT  and  safety  populations  included  all  randomized  subjects  who 
received any amount of investigational product (N=334). The ITT population was the primary population 
used for efficacy analyses. The safety population was the primary population used for safety analyses. 
Only treatment-emergent events were included (i.e., following exposure to the investigational product 
or within 30 days after the discontinuation of investigational product) in the safety analyses.  
Of note, 2 deaths (one subject in the OCA group and one in the placebo group; both subjects were in 
the proposed SmPC contraindicated population at baseline) occurred after the subjects had withdrawn 
from the study, without providing explicit consent for continued collection of clinical outcome data. These 
events  were  inadvertently  reported  in  the  clinical  database.  These  were  excluded  from  the  analyses 
following the study protocol and ICH/GCP principles (i.e., data collected/reported outside of the protocol 
requirements without subject consent). 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
In  Study  747-302  a  total  of  60  liver  transplants  and  deaths  in  the  overall  safety  population  were 
retrospectively adjudicated in a blinded manner by the HSAC (32 [19.0%] subjects OCA vs 28 [16.9%] 
placebo, considered possibly treatment related in 12.5% OCA vs 3.6% placebo). Less than half occurred 
in  patients  with  decompensated  liver  disease  (26),  and  the  remaining  34  occurred  in  patients  with 
compensated disease (20 in OCA vs 14 in placebo) per current SmPC. However, the numerical imbalance 
in  OCA  and  placebo  treated  groups  is  observed  across  all  the  PBC  groups  analysed:  overall  safety 
population,  compensated  vs  contraindicated  per  current  SmPC,  compensated  vs  contraindicated  for 
newly proposed restricted indication. Indeed, these events are evenly distributed between compensated 
vs decompensated subsets per current SmPC. Not unexpectedly, a stricter definition of mild PBC, as it 
is now proposed, reduces the number of these events in the compensated subset (13 compensated vs 
47 contraindicated per newly proposed SmPC), though still 13 events of disease progression to transplant 
or death are observed in an otherwise less advanced PBC population and mostly in OCA treated subjects 
(11 vs 2 placebo).   
In the overall safety PBC population, a total of 24 death events (11 placebo vs 13 OCA) were observed. 
All death events were considered unlikely related to the investigational treatment. Of them, most were 
non-liver related. Death events deemed likely related to treatment occurred numerically higher in OCA-
treated group, regardless of the PBC disease severity. A total of 38 liver transplant events (18 placebo 
vs 20 OCA) were reported, most of them were unlikely related to treatment. Numbers are limited and 
differences purely numerical, but these differences remain in the milder PBC subset where 4 events of 
liver transplant were observed in OCA vs 1 in placebo. This is considered a matter of concern.  
The Company claims that the observed imbalance in liver transplants and deaths in Study 747-302 was 
not valid and reflected significant bias, particularly in favour of the placebo group, given that the event 
rates observed in the placebo group in Study 747-302 did not reflect the high event rates seen in real-
world analyses. In addition, it is claimed that the liver transplant event rates observed in the OCA group 
in Study 747-302 was not consistent with the rates seen over time in a comprehensive liver transplant 
national registry. However, the evidence showing an increased incidence of liver transplant and death 
events in OCA vs placebo treated subjects across the spectrum of PBC populations analysed has been 
generated  in  a  randomised,  double  blind,  placebo-controlled  trial,  with  central  adjudication  of  these 
events.  Given  the  heterogeneity  in  the  PBC  disease  progression  or  maybe  also  differences  in  local 
transplant practices, differences with external cohorts are not unexpected, but do not serve as sound 
evidence to invalidate the RCT outcomes. Furthermore, it is uncertain to what extent the high rates of 
pruritus  (new  or  worsening)  associated  to  OCA  treatment,  often  moderate-severe  and  potentially 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 292/319 
 
  
 
 
refractory  to  available  treatments,  might  have  contributed  to  the  higher-than-expected  rates  of  liver 
transplant events in OCA treated group, but this would not alleviate the concern. It is also uncertain if 
differences in exposure might explain to some extent the observed differences, the MAH should further 
comment.  
Finally, since marketing approval in 2016, 47 fatal reports due to hepatic events have been reported, 
and the majority were reported from patients who would now be contraindicated by the current SmPC. 
Cumulatively,  33  reports  of  liver  transplants  (31  with  PT  of  liver  transplant,  and  2  with  PT  of  liver 
transplant rejection) have been reported. According to the Company, no increased risk of liver transplant 
or deaths has been observed in the post-marketing setting. However, bearing in mind that these events 
are expected during this progressive condition, the low post marketing reports are not unexpected nor 
reassuring at all. 
The existing concern remains. Even if less events are observed in a milder subset of the PBC 
population, these results should be interpreted with caution. Final acceptability will be a matter of 
benefit-risk assessment. 
Issue not solved, to be further followed up within the appropriate procedure.  
Question 14 
The  incidence  of  cholecystitis/cholelithiasis  TEAEs  was  5.4%  in  both  treated  groups,  but  a 
higher incidence of cholelithiasis-related events was seen in the OCA treated group. For the 
compensated  subset,  a  similar  pattern  was  seen:  5.1%  OCA-treated  and  6.2%  placebo-
treated  patients  experienced  a  cholecystitis/cholelithiasis  TEAEs.  Of  these,  4  patients 
reported  cholecystitis/cholelithiasis  SAEs  (3  patients  in  the  OCA  group:  2  patients  with 
cholelithiasis  and  1  patient  with  bile  duct  stone;  1  patient  in  the  placebo  group  with 
cholecystitis).  The  MAH  is  invited  to  present  comparative  tabulated  results  of  these 
cholelithiasis-related  TEAE  for  the  overall  safety  population  vs  decompensated  vs 
compensated patients, and discuss if a higher incidence should be expected in patients with 
a more advance disease.  
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The  MAH  assessed  the  frequency  of  events  between  OCA  and  placebo  in  the  overall,  compensated 
(indicated  per  current  SmPC),  and  decompensated  (contraindicated  per  current  SmPC)  populations. 
Given the subjects in these various groups have more advanced PBC disease and many of which are now 
contraindicated, the MAH has explored a more appropriate population that maximizes the benefit:risk 
profile. Therefore, the MAH has now proposed a revised SmPC population to contraindicate patients with 
compensated  cirrhosis  with  evidence  of  portal  hypertension  (PH)  and/or  hepatic  decompensation  at 
baseline.  
The  incidence  of  cholecystitis/cholelithiasis  TEAESIs  was  higher  in  OCA-treated  subjects  with  more 
advanced  stage  PBC  (i.e.,  proposed  SmPC  contraindicated  or  decompensated  [contraindicated  per 
current  SmPC]  populations)  than  subjects  with  earlier  stage  PBC  (i.e.,  proposed  SmPC  indicated  or 
compensated [indicated per current SmPC] populations) in Study 747-302.  
In addition, the MAH evaluated cholecystitis/cholelithiasis TEAESIs in post-marketing data and found no 
increased risk with OCA.  
Study 747-302: Cholecystitis/cholelithiasis TEAESIs  
Cholecystitis/cholelithiasis TEAESIs and serious cholecystitis/cholelithiasis TEAESIs are summarized by 
overall, decompensated (contraindicated per current SmPC), compensated (indicated per current SmPC), 
the proposed SmPC indicated, and proposed SmPC contraindicated populations in Table 109.  
EMA/528620/2023

Cholecystitis/cholelithiasis  TEAESIs  were  defined  by  Gallbladder  related  disorders  narrow  SMQ  and 
Gallstone related disorders narrow SMQ.  
The  incidence  of  cholecystitis/cholelithiasis  TEAESIs  was  higher  in  OCA-treated  subjects  with  more 
advanced  stage  PBC  (i.e.,  proposed  SmPC  contraindicated  or  decompensated  [contraindicated  per 
current  SmPC]  populations)  than  subjects  with  earlier  stage  PBC  (i.e.,  proposed  SmPC  indicated  or 
compensated  [indicated  per  current  SmPC]  populations).  Within  earlier  stage  PBC,  the  incidence  of 
cholecystitis/cholelithiasis TEAESIs was higher for compensated OCA-treated subjects compared to OCA-
treated subjects in the proposed SmPC indicated population. 
In the proposed SmPC indicated population, 3 (3.7%) subjects in the OCA group and 1 (1.5%) subject 
in  the  placebo  group  reported  a  cholecystitis/cholelithiasis  TEAESI.  Cholelithiasis  was  the  only  PT 
reported across treatment groups. All cholecystitis/cholelithiasis TEAESIs were considered not related to 
investigational product by the Investigator and were mild to moderate in severity.  
Of these, 1 OCA-treated subject in the proposed SmPC indicated population reported a serious TEAESI:  
•  One female PBC subject in the proposed SmPC indicated population reported a serious TEAESI 
of  cholelithiasison  16  Dec  2019  (Study  Day  1133),  approximately  3  years  and  1  month  after 
initiation  of  OCA.  The  subject  had  a  history  of  gallbladder  stones  and  was  hospitalized  for  an 
elective laparoscopic assisted cholecystectomy due to cholelithiasis. The event of cholelithiasis 
was  considered  resolved  on  17  Dec  2019  (Study  Day  1134).  The  Investigator  and  the  MAH 
assessed  the  event  of  cholelithiasis  as  moderate  in  severity  and  unlikely  related  to  the 
investigational product.  
In addition, 1 OCA-treated subject in the proposed SmPC indicated population reported a serious TEAESI 
of  cholelithiasis  that  was  not  treatment-emergent  (i.e.,  after  30  days  of  permanently  discontinuing 
investigational  product),  which  was  considered  possibly  related  by  the  Investigator.  The  event  was 
assessed  as  moderate  in  severity  and  resolved  after  an  elective  laparoscopic  cholecystectomy  was 
performed.

Ocaliva Post-marketing Data: Cholecystitis/cholelithiasis PTs  
OCA was granted accelerated approval under the trade name Ocaliva by the US FDA on 27 May 2016, 
and received conditional approval by the European Commission on 12 Dec 2016, by Health Canada on 
24 May 2017, and is now approved in 43 countries for the treatment of PBC in combination with UDCA 
in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA or as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA. As 
of May 2023, the estimated cumulative global patient-years exposure from marketing experience is over 
35,000 patient-years.  
No increased risk of cholecystitis/cholelithiasis events has been observed in the post-marketing setting. 
Cumulatively,  since  marketing  approval  in  2016,  99  reports  which  included  131  Gallbladder  disorder 
events have been reported. The most frequent adverse events reported were PTs of cholelithiasis (37), 
cholecystectomy (28), gallbladder disorder (10), cholangitis (9), cholecystitis (7), bile duct stenosis (7), 
and bile duct stone (7). Two cases with a fatal outcome were reported, both cases were assessed as not 
related to Ocaliva, and one was from a patient with advanced disease who would now be contraindicated 
per the current SmPC and one for whom baseline status before initiating Ocaliva is unknown. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The Company has provided the requested data. The MAH assessed the frequency of events between OCA 
and  placebo  in  the  overall,  compensated  (indicated  per  current  SmPC),  and  decompensated 
(contraindicated per current SmPC) populations, as well as in the newly proposed revised SmPC indicated 
vs  contraindicated  populations  (i.e.  patients  with  compensated  cirrhosis  with  evidence  of  portal 
hypertension  (PH)  and/or  hepatic  decompensation  at  baseline).  The  incidence  of  cholelithiasis  TEAEs 
events in the overall safety population was 7 (4.2%) OCA vs 4 (2.4%) placebo, including 3 SAEs OCA vs 
1 in placebo. A clear reduction of the cholelithiasis/cystitis events is only seen in the milder compensated 
subset  of  PBC  (newly  proposed),  mostly  at  the  expenses  of  a  reduction  in  cholecystitic  events. 
Nevertheless, in the proposed SmPC indicated population, still the incidence of cholecystitis/cholelithiasis 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 295/319 
 
  
 
 
 
TEAESI remains numerically higher in OCA treated patients (3 (3.7%) OCA vs 1 (1.5%) subject in the 
placebo group), one of these being a SAEs in OCA. During the clinical pharmacology studies, one patient 
experienced  two  SAEs  of  cholelithiasis  and  acute  cholecystitis  while  on  OCA  treatment,  considered 
treatment  related  by  the  investigator.  Although  these  events  are  not  unexpected  in  PBC  subjects,  it 
appears that OCA treatment might slightly increase the incidence of these events. Postmarketing data 
further  support  this  assumption.  Cumulatively,  since  marketing  approval  in  2016,  99  reports  which 
included 131 gallbladder disorder events have been reported. The most frequent AEs reported were PTs 
of cholelithiasis (37), cholecystectomy (28), gallbladder disorder (10), cholangitis (9), cholecystitis (7), 
bile duct stenosis (7), and bile duct stone (7). Two cases with a fatal outcome were reported, both cases 
were assessed as not related to Ocaliva, and one was from a patient with advanced disease who would 
now be contraindicated per the current SmPC and one for whom baseline status before initiating Ocaliva 
is unknown.  
Thus, even if a more benign safety profile is seen in a milder newly subset of the PBC population, 
results should be interpreted with caution given the limitations of the analyses conducted as outlined 
previously. An increased risk is seen consistently, acceptability of the increased risk including further 
SmPC amendments will be a matter of benefit-risk assessment. 
Issue partially solved, but not further pursued within this procedure. 
Question 15 
The safety of OCA in special populations deserved further discussion, particularly, safety data 
in  the  elderly  population  should  be  provided  and  any  relevant  differences  with  previous 
observations  will  need  to  be  discussed.  The  same  would  apply  for  patients  with  renal 
impairment, bearing in mind the increased risk for renal events during OCA treatment. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Safety Data in the Elderly Population  
Of the 334 subjects in the safety population of Study 747-302, 54 (16.2%) were ≥65 years and 2 (0.6%) 
were >75 years. Both subjects >75 years were randomized to placebo, thus, analyses are presented by 
“age at time of enrollment” for the <65 years and ≥65 years subgroups only. The frequency of AESIs 
between OCA and placebo by age subgroup was analyzed for the overall and proposed SmPC indicated 
populations in Table 110.  
Overall Population  
For the overall population, the age distribution in the placebo group was similar as that of OCA-treated 
subjects (140 subjects <65 years of age and 26 to 28 subjects were ≥65 years of age). Although the 
disparity in the overall number of subjects between the age subgroups precludes major conclusions, a 
review of AESIs by baseline age subgroup did not indicate any meaningful differences and trends across 
the subgroups appeared to be generally similar.  
There were more OCA-treated subjects ≥65 years of age with a cardiovascular disorder TEAE compared 
with subjects <65 years of age (18% and 8%, respectively); this pattern was also observed in placebo-
treated subjects (8% and 4%, respectively). Similarly, more OCA-treated subjects ≥65 years of age had 
a renal TEAE compared with subjects <65 years of age (21% and 8%, respectively); this pattern was 
also observed in placebo-treated subjects (15% and 6%, respectively). This pattern for higher incidence 
of  cardiovascular  and  renal  disorders  in  the  ≥65  years  group  suggests  these  are  likely  age-related 
observations  as  opposed  to  treatment-related.  All  other  AESIs  (pruritus,  hepatic  disorders, 
cholecystitis/cholelithiasis and dyslipidemia) were similar between subjects <65 years of age compared 
with  subjects  ≥65  years  of  age  although,  the  small  number  ≥65  years  subjects  preclude  definitive

conclusions.  
Proposed SmPC Indicated Population  
The age distribution in the placebo group was similar as that of OCA-treated subjects for the ≥65 years 
subgroup (10 to 11 subjects) and (140 subjects <65 years of age and 26 to 28 subjects were ≥65 years 
of age), but slightly higher for OCA-treated subjects compared to placebo subjects (71 vs 57) in the <65 
years  subgroup.  Similar  trends  in  AESIs  were  observed  in  the  proposed  SmPC  indicated  population 
compared to the overall population though the small number of subjects in the proposed SmPC indicated 
population (10 to 11 subjects) precludes definitive conclusions. Of note, the 3 CV events in OCA-treated 
subjects  in  the  ≥65  years  subgroup  were  thrombosis  related  events  (thrombosis,  TTP,  venous 
thrombosis), no MACE event was reported in any OCA-treated subject in this subgroup. 
EMA/528620/2023

Safety Data by Renal Impairment  
As  shown  in  Table  111,  the  majority  of  subjects  had  normal  renal  status  at  baseline  as  defined  by  a 
normal  creatinine  and  estimated  glomerular  filtration  rate  (eGFR).  CKD  stage  distribution  at  baseline 
was 69% stage 1, 20% stage 2, and 2% stage 3. Subjects with hepatorenal syndrome (type I or II) or 
Screening (visit 1 or 2) serum creatinine >2 mg/dL (178 μmol/L) were excluded from the study, thus, 
no subjects enrolled were CKD stage 4 or 5 at baseline. Given only 2% of the population was stage 3, 
the safety analyses are summarized by stage 1 and stage 2/3 subgroups.  
Within each subgroup (stage 1 vs stage 2/3), baseline distribution in the placebo group was similar as 
that of OCA-treated subjects for both the overall and proposed SmPC indicated population. 
AESI data by baseline CKD stage are summarized in Table 112 for the overall and proposed SmPC 
indicated population.  
Although the disparity in the overall number of subjects between the subgroups precludes major 
conclusions, a review of AESIs by baseline CKD subgroup did not indicate any obvious differences for 
the overall and trends across the subgroups appeared to be generally similar.  
As expected, there were more renal disorder TEAEs reported in subjects with more advanced chronic 
kidney disease (CKD stage 2/3), both in the OCA-treated and the placebo-treated groups than in 
subjects with a more preserved glomerular filtration rate (CKD stage 1): OCA: 7% and 6%, 
respectively and placebo-treated: 9% and 4%, respectively.  
In proposed SmPC indicated population, there was no clear pattern for any TEAESIs across treatment 
groups and no AKIs reported in subjects with CKD Stage 2/3. 
EMA/528620/2023

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The Company was requested to present and discuss the safety profile of OCA in the elderly population. 
No information on the overall incidence of TEAEs, serious & severe TEAEs, AE leading to discontinuation 
and leading to death have been provided. Thus, no conclusion can be drawn on the toxicity/tolerability 
of OCA treatment in the elderly population. This should be provided, including a discussion on whether 
a more toxic and/or less tolerated safety profile would be expected in ≥65 years subjects.  
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 299/319 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Instead, the Company has presented tabulated data of the incidence of TEASIs both in the overall safety 
population and in the newly proposed indicated subset by “age at time of enrolment” for the <65 years 
and ≥65 years subgroups only. A total of 54 (16.2%) out of the 334 subjects included in Study 747-302 
were ≥65 years and 2 (0.6%) were >75 years (but these two were assigned to placebo). As expected, 
higher  incidences  of  cardiovascular  disorder  TEAEs  and  renal  TEAEs  were  observed  in  subjects  ≥65 
years,  both  in  placebo  and  OCA  treated  groups.  For  the  remaining  TEAESI  of  pruritus,  hepatic, 
cholecystitis/cholelithiasis,  and  lipid  disorders,  similar  incidences  to  those  seen  in  adult  subjects  are 
observed. These results should be interpreted with caution given the low number of ≥65 years subjects, 
which preclude definitive conclusions. Similar trends in AESIs are noted for the proposed SmPC indicated 
population compared to the overall safety population, though the numbers are too limited (10 subjects 
in placebo vs 11 in OCA) to firmly conclude.  
Safety in subjects with renal impairment at baseline was also analysed. The majority of subjects had 
normal renal status at baseline: CKD stage distribution was 69% stage 1, 20% stage 2, and 2% stage 
3. CKD stage 4 or 5 at baseline were excluded. Given only 2% of the population was stage 3, the safety 
analyses are summarized by stage 1 and stage 2/3 subgroups. Again, information has only been provided 
for the AESIs, and not the overall safety profile. This should be provided. The analysis of AESIs by renal 
CKD stage at baseline show a similar pattern, with one relevant exception: a higher incidence of renal 
events in CKD Stage 2/3 subjects (9.4% placebo vs 17.1% OCA) was noted. This is not unexpected. 
Even if numbers are limited to firmly conclude, the risk of higher renal events in patients with CKD Stage 
2 should be reflected in the SmPC Section 4.8, as well as the lack of data in subjects with more severe 
renal impairment.  
Issue not solved, to be further pursued within the appropriate procedure. The Company did not 
present the overall incidence of TEAEs, serious & severe TEAEs, AE leading to discontinuation and leading 
to death, tabulated as for the TEASIs events (for the overall safety population and the newly proposed 
indication by age and by renal CKD stage), including a discussion on whether a more toxic and/or less 
tolerated safety profile would be expected in ≥65 years subjects or in subjects with CKD Stage 2/3 which 
may  become  of  relevance  in  the  appropriate  follow  up  procedure  assessing  the  Benefit  /  Risk  of  the 
product this may include proposed updates to the SmPC (including 4.8).  
RWE 
Question 16 
The external comparator analyses cannot serve as a replacement of the negative results from 
the placebo controlled study and are considered purely exploratory. Despite this, the MAH is 
requested  to  discuss  why  such  remarkable  differences  are  observed  between  the  placebo-
controlled study and the RWE in order to better elucidate the value of these data. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  agrees  that  the  real-word  evidence  (RWE)  is  not  a 
“replacement”  for  Study  747-302.  Instead,  the  MAH  believes  that  a  series  of  MAH-supported  and 
independent studies provide consistent evidence of clinically meaningful obeticholic acid (OCA) benefit 
in  improving  transplant-free  and  event-free  survival  in  patients  living  with  primary  biliary  cholangitis 
(PBC) with inadequate response or intolerant to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), and should be included 
as part of Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use’s (CHMP’s) assessment of obeticholic acid 
(OCA) benefit:risk.  
As  discussed  in  Question  8,  there  was  significant  treatment  crossover  in  both  the  placebo  and  OCA-
treated  groups  in  747-302.  In  the  placebo  group,  there  is  evidence  that  crossover  was  the  result  of 
functional unblinding associated with high ALP levels, which was associated with initiation of commercial 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 300/319 
 
  
 
 
PBC  treatments,  which  proved  effective  in  lowering  ALP.  Conversely,  65%  of  OCA-treated  subjects 
discontinued therapy before experiencing a clinical event. This degree of crossover makes it impossible 
to conduct meaningful intent-to-treat (ITT) analyses, as subject treatment status was largely discordant 
with  randomized  treatment  assignment.  The  inverse  probability  censored  weighting  (IPCW)  analysis 
referenced by the CHMP, as well as the analyses of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) endpoint, 
all  showed  similar  moderate  benefit  (HR=0.80  to  0.84),  but  all  remain  subject  to  bias  that  would 
compromise the magnitude of treatment effect.  
Due to the lack of feasibility of Study 747-302, and the understanding that further randomized controlled 
trials would be equally infeasible, the MAH undertook multiple real-world studies to assess the effect of 
OCA on clinical outcomes including death, liver transplant, and hepatic decompensation. These studies 
demonstrated consistent reductions (58% to 71%) in the relative risk of serious clinical events for PBC 
patients treated with OCA, a substantial benefit that should be considered in the overall assessment of 
benefit:risk. These studies included:  
1. Study 747-405, fully real-world using the Komodo Health US claims database  
2. Study 747-302, OCA-treated versus external controls from Komodo Health  
3.  Study  747-301,  long-term  safety  extension  (LTSE)  versus  external  controls  from  the  Global-PBC 
registry  
4. Study 747-301, LTSE versus external controls from the United Kingdom (UK) PBC registry  
As shown in Table 113, the treatment effects across these studies are stable: HRs ranged from 0.29 to 
0.40 for time-to-death and liver transplant; and from 0.30 to 0.42 for death, liver transplant or hepatic 
decompensation.  In  addition  to  these  MAH-supported  studies,  an  independent  Italian  study  group 
independently  conducted  a  fully  real-world  time-to-event  study  of  OCA-treated  patients  from  the 
combined Italian PBC registries versus external controls from Global PBC. Results from this independent 
study were consistent with those of the MAH-supported studies demonstrating an HR=0.32 for risk of 
death and liver transplant, and HR=0.33 for risk of death, liver transplant, or hepatic decompensation 
(Gentilluci 2023).  
A relative risk reduction of 58% to 71% in serious clinical events of all-cause death, liver transplants, 
and hepatic decompensation offers strong support that OCA treatment provides a clinically meaningful 
and significant benefit to appropriately treated PBC patients with a positive benefit:risk, not replacing 
but supplementing Study 747-302. 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 301/319 
 
  
 
 
Each of these studies is described below to allow CHMP to better evaluate the diversity of populations 
and design, and consistency of results across studies.  
Study 747-405  
Study Design  
Study 747-405 was a nested trial emulation study (Hernán 2008, Danaei 2013, Brookhart 2015; Figure 
43). The study utilized the Komodo Health claims database, with >100,000 patients diagnosed with PBC, 
merged  through  Datavant  tokenization  with  LabCorp  and  Quest  Diagnostics  laboratory  data,  Organ 
Procurement  and  Transplantation  Network  (OPTN)  transplant  data,  and  Social  Security  Disability 
Insurance Program (SSDI)+national obituary search death data. The study utilized 747-301 eligibility 
criteria and was designed to replicate the results observed in the 747-301 open-label extension with an 
external controls outcomes study.  
The  treatment  group  included  patients  with  PBC  who  initiated  OCA.  The  control  group  allowed  OCA-
eligible,  but  not  OCA-treated  patients,  to  contribute  an  index  for  each  eligible  visit.  Eligibility  was 
determined based on inclusion criteria for Study 747-301 as originally designed. Study 747-405 tested 
the hypothesis that treatment with OCA would increase event-free survival (progression to death, liver 
transplant, or hepatic decompensation) relative to comparable OCA-eligible but non-OCA-treated control 
patients. 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 302/319 
 
  
 
 
 
To  ensure  balance  between  the  OCA-treated  and  non-OCA-treated  groups,  propensity  scores  were 
generated using a logistic regression model, predicting treatment as the outcome (for predictor variables, 
see  Figure  44).  The  propensity  scores  were  used  to  generate  standardized  morbidity  ratio  weights, 
applied to controls. A standardized mean difference of +0.10 was prespecified as indicative of adequate 
balance on baseline variables.  
The primary efficacy analysis was an as-treated analysis, censoring OCA-treated patients 90-days after 
OCA  discontinuation  or  upon  the  initiation  of  fibrates;  and  censoring  control  patients  at  initiation  of 
commercial treatments (OCA, fibrates, or UDCA if patients were not treated with UDCA at baseline). Cox 
regression  and  log-rank  test  assessed  time  to  the  composite  outcome.  Secondary  efficacy  analyses 
assessed treatment impact on components of the composite. Sensitivity analyses included ITT analyses 
removing  censoring;  sub-group  analyses  to  examine  consistency  of  effect  by  patients  and  disease 
characteristics; and quantitative bias analyses.  
Results  
After applying Study 747-301 eligibility criteria, 4535 patients contributed 12,399 control index dates, 
and  432  patients  contributed  an  OCA  index.  After  weighting,  all  standardized  mean  differences  were 
within the pre-specified +0.10 threshold (Figure 44). Groups were well balanced after weighting: >90% 
female; mean age, 56 years; UDCA use=73%; total bilirubin=0.7 mg/dL; and ALP=292 U/L to 294 U/L 
(Table 114).

Subgroup  analyses  by  sex,  age,  region,  baseline  cirrhosis,  baseline  hypertension,  and  time  period 
(pre/post-COVID) demonstrated evidence of benefit in all subgroups except for the male sex, which had 
only 31 patients in the OCA treatment group (Figure 46). ITT analyses in which OCA patients were not 
censored  after  OCA  discontinuation  or  fibrate  initiation  demonstrated  statistically  significant  benefit 
(HR=0.59; 95% CI 0.337, 0.995); ITT analyses that also did not censor control patients at initiation of 
commercial PBC treatments found an effect of similar magnitude (HR=0.64; 95% CI 0.378, 1.048).  
Quantitative bias analyses demonstrated that the observed treatment effect was robust even in the face 
of significant potential confounding. Evidence of benefit was eliminated only if a potential confounder 
was present in 50% of the population, the benefit was at the low range of the 95% CI for the primary 
efficacy effect (HR, 0.75), and the confounder was strongly associated with the outcome (HR <0.50). 
Conclusion  
This study demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 63% reduction in relative risk 
for death, liver transplant, and hepatic decompensation. The observed effect was robust across endpoint 
components, patient subgroups (with the exception of the male sex), when an ITT approach was taken, 
and in quantitative bias analyses that demonstrate benefit even in the face of significant confounding.  
Study 747-301 Open Label Extension with External Controls  
Study Design  
Study 747-301 (POISE) was a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study examining the 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 305/319 
 
  
 
 
 
 
effect of OCA-treatment on a surrogate endpoint: ALP <1.67x ULN with a >15% reduction from baseline 
ALP  level  and  bilirubin  <ULN  at  12  months.  After  12  months,  subjects  randomized  to  OCA  continued 
treatment  and  subjects  randomized  to  placebo  crossed  over  to  OCA-treatment,  with  an  open-label 
observation period of up to 5 additional years.  
Two external control groups were created, one from the Global PBC registry and one from the UK PBC 
registry. The Global PBC registry includes 6484 non–OCA-treated patients with PBC recruited from 17 
liver centres across 8 countries in Europe and North America between September 2012 and August 2016. 
The UK PBC registry includes more than 6900 non–OCA-treated patients with PBC recruited from 161 
UK centres between February 2008 and December 2020.  
The 747-301 LTSE external control study was designed and executed before the release of the FDA draft 
guidances governing the use of real-world data. As such, it does not meet several of the requirements 
in the guidances, e.g., pre-submission of the protocol to the Agency. The MAH believes that, though the 
study does not meet guidance specifications, it is a well-designed, scientifically rigorous study.  
The external control group was created by identifying each study visit on which a registry patient met 
POISE inclusion/exclusion criteria (Figure 47). A random visit was selected between first and last eligible 
visit  (inclusive)  and  served  as  the  index  visit,  the  equivalent  of  the  randomization  date  for  the  OCA-
treated subjects in POISE. Baseline patient characteristics were established at index, and patients were 
followed for events from index date forward. The study tested the hypothesis that treatment with OCA 
would increase transplant-free survival (progression to death or liver transplant) relative to comparable 
external controls. 
To ensure balance between the OCA-treated subjects in POISE and non-OCA-treated external controls, 
a logistic regression, with treatment group as outcome and demographic, laboratory, disease state and 
treatment variables as predictors, was used to generate propensity scores (for predictor variables, see 
Figure 48). The propensity scores were used to generate inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW), 
applied to OCA-treated patients and controls. IPTW were truncated at 10 and stabilized. A standardized 
mean difference of +0.25 was prespecified as indicative of adequate balance on baseline variables.  
The primary efficacy analysis was ITT. A Cox regression and log-rank test assessed time to the composite 
outcome. Events during the first 6 months were excluded in the primary analysis to ensure early events 
were not due to residual differences in baseline disease state. A sensitivity analysis was conducted which 
included these events. Secondary efficacy analyses assessed treatment impact on time to a composite 
endpoint  of  death,  liver  transplant,  or  hepatic  decompensation  only  using  the  Global  PBC  cohort. 
Sensitivity  analyses  included  running  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  with  first  and  last  eligible  visit  as 
index date and modifying the analysis to control only for treatment group, or to enter baseline variables 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 306/319 
 
  
 
 
 
as covariates in the Cox regression, as opposed to using IPTW. A subgroup analysis was run on patients 
with and without baseline cirrhosis. A third sensitivity analysis examined biomarkers during the first year 
for patients randomized to placebo, versus untreated controls, to test for the possibility that selection 
bias resulted in the placebo group who were healthier than external controls.  
Results  
Of the 4922 patients in the Global PBC registry, 1381 met POISE inclusion criteria, with 6702 qualifying 
visits. Of the 6543 patients in the UK PBC registry, 2135 patients met POISE inclusion criteria, with 8331 
qualifying visits. After weighting, all standardized mean differences were within the pre-specified +0.25 
threshold for the Global PBC external control (Figure 48). In the UK PBC controls, ALT was sufficiently 
imbalanced after weighting that it was removed from the logistic and propensity score and entered as a 
covariate  in  the  Cox  regression.  Though  PBC  duration  was  slightly  outside  the  prespecified  range 
(standardized variable difference=0.259), it was not included as an additional covariate. 
During the 6-year follow-up, there were 5 composite events (2 liver transplantations and 3 deaths) in 
209 OCA-treated subjects in POISE (2.4%). There were 135 events (51 liver transplantations and 84 
deaths)  in  1381  patients  in  the  Global  PBC  external  control  (10.0%;  HR=0.29;  95%  CI  0.10,  0.83; 
p=0.02;  Figure  49A).  There  were  281  events  (119  liver  transplantations  and  162  deaths)  in  2135 
patients in the UK-PBC controls (13.2%; HR=0.30; 95% CI 0.12, 0.75; p<0.01; Figure 49B). There were 
16 events of death, liver transplantations, or hepatic decompensation in 209 OCA-treated subjects in 
POISE (7.7%) versus 212 events in 1381 patients in the Global PBC external control (15.4%; HR=0.42; 
95% CI 0.21, 0.85; p=0.02). 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 307/319 
 
  
 
 
 
Treatment benefit was observed regardless of whether first, random or last eligible visit was used as 
index, and was observed regardless of the analytic technique used to balance baseline covariates (Figure 
50).  Treatment  benefit  was  observed  in  patients  with  cirrhosis  (HR=0.20;  95%  CI  0.03,  1.22)  and 
without cirrhosis (HR=0.31; 95% CI 0.09,1.04). Results did not change appreciably when events that 
occurred in the first 6 months after index were not excluded (Global PBC HR=0.26; 95% CI 0.09, 0.74; 
UK-PBC HR= 0.25; 95% CI 0.10, 0.60). 
When change from baseline ALP, total bilirubin, and AST were compared in the placebo group from Study 
747-301 in first 12 months after randomization, versus the external controls first 12 months after index, 
all biomarkers numerically favoured the external control groups, with the exception of bilirubin in the 
UK-PBC control group (Table 115). Thus, the data did not support the hypothesis of selection bias in 
which the placebo group was healthier than the external controls.

Conclusion  
This  study  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  and  clinically  meaningful  70%  to  71%  reduction  in 
relative risk for death and liver transplant, and 58% reduction in relative risk for death, liver transplant, 
and hepatic decompensation (i.e., serious clinical events). The observed effect was robust regardless of 
whether  first,  last,  or  random  index  was  selected,  and  regardless  of  the  statistical  approach  used  to 
address confounding. The results were not consistent with the hypothesis of selection bias in favour of 
the external control.  
Study 747-302 with External Controls  
Study Design  
Study 747-302 was a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3b/4 confirmatory outcomes 
trial examining the effect of OCA-treatment on event-free survival. Study 747-302 enrolled subjects with 
advanced  PBC.  After  the  trial  was  discontinued,  a  second  expanded  endpoint  was  created  to  include 
clinical  evidence  of  portal  hypertension  with  or  without  decompensation  and  became  conditional  on 
disease status at baseline.  
In anticipation that the trial might prove infeasible, an external control group was created to allow for 
alternative means of efficacy evaluation. The study utilized the Komodo Health claims database, with 
>100,000 patients diagnosed with PBC, merged through Datavant tokenization with LabCorp and Quest 
Diagnostics laboratory data, OPTN transplant data, and SSDI+national obituary search death data. The 
protocol and statistical analysis plan were developed after the 2021 RWE draft guidances were released 
and were pre-submitted to the FDA. While the study was executed before the 2023 FDA draft guidance 
on  external  controls,  after  careful  review  the  MAH  believes  the  study  was  conducted  in  a  manner 
consistent with that guidance.  
The  EC  group  was  created  by  identifying  each  study  visit  on  which  a  registry  patient  met  747-302 
inclusion/exclusion criteria (Figure 51). A random visit was selected from all eligible visits and served as 
the  index  visit,  the  equivalent  of  the  randomization  date  for  the  OCA-treated  subjects  in  747-302. 
Baseline patient characteristics were established at index, and patients were followed for events from 
index date forward. The study tested the hypothesis that treatment with OCA would increase event and 
transplant-free  survival  (progression  to  death  or  liver  transplant)  relative  to  comparable  external 
controls.

To ensure balance between the OCA-treated patients in 747-302 and non-OCA-treated external controls, 
a logistic regression, with treatment group as outcome and demographic, laboratory, disease state and 
treatment variables as predictors, was used to generate propensity scores (for predictor variables, see 
Figure 52). The propensity scores were used to standardized morbidity ratios (SMRs), applied to external 
controls. A standardized mean difference of +0.10 was prespecified as indicative of adequate balance on 
baseline variables. In addition to the external control group, a group of patients initiating OCA in the 
Komodo was created, using the same 747-302 eligibility criteria and SMR weighting approach.  
The primary efficacy analysis was an as-treated analysis, censoring OCA-treated patients 90-days after 
OCA  discontinuation;  and  censoring  control  patients  at  initiation  of  commercial  treatments  (OCA, 
fibrates, or UDCA if patients were not treated with UDCA at baseline). A Cox regression and log-rank 
test assessed time to the composite outcome. The SAP required that analyses needed to be powered at 
0.70. Only the FDA expanded endpoint analysing the full population met this threshold (0.76), though 
the 747-302 protocol version 6 approached the threshold (0.65). Both analyses are presented.  
Results  
There were 168 subjects randomized to OCA treatment in the 747-302 trial and were included in the 
external control analysis. There were 1051 external controls in the Komodo health database who met 
747-302 eligibility criteria (Table 116). After weighting, the OCA-treated arm and external controls were 
well balanced; however, platelet count, and clinical evidence of portal hypertension fell just outside of 
the  prespecified  ±0.10  standardized  mean  difference  (SMD)  threshold  (0.15  and  -0.12,  respectively) 
and were included as covariates in the Cox regression model (Figure 52).

For the 747-302 protocol version 6 endpoint analysis of all subjects (Figure 53), there were 17 events 
(10.1%) in the 747-302 OCA group and 35.4 events (21.5%) in external controls (HR=0.39; 95% CI 
0.22, 0.69; p<0.001). The primary difference in events vs the ITT analysis was due to censoring OCA-
treated patients 90 days after OCA discontinuation: 31 of 48 OCA-treated subjects were censored prior 
to the composite endpoint. There was a similar percentage of events (7 events, 10.0%) in the Komodo 
OCA-treated group as in the 747-302 OCA-treated group.

For the FDA expanded endpoint, in the analysis of all patients, there were 28 events among 168 patients 
(16.7%)  in  the  747-302  OCA  group  and  45.5  endpoints  among  164.9  patients  (27.6%)  in  external 
controls (HR=0.48; 95% CI 0.30, 0.77; Figure 54).  
This study demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 61% reduction in relative risk 
for  death,  liver  transplant  and  hepatic  decompensation  among  all  patients  enrolled  in  the  study.  The 
event  rate  among  OCA-treated  patients  in  747-302  and  comparable  OCA-treated  patients  in  Komodo 
were nearly identical. The observed effect was similar for the FDA endpoint among all patients, with a 
52% reduction in relative risk of progression to death, liver transplant, hepatic decompensation, or portal 
hypertension. 
RECAPITULATE  
Study Design  
RECAPITULATE was a fully real-world observational study comparing OCA-treated patients with PBC from 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 313/319 
 
  
 
 
 
 
the consolidated Italian PBC registry to OCA-eligible but non-OCA-treated patients with PBC  from the 
Global PBC registry. The consolidated Italian PBC registry included OCA-treated patients with PBC from 
the  Italian  PBC  Registry;  Club  Epatologi  Ospedalieri  (CLEO);  Associazione  Italiana  Gastroenterologie 
Endoscopisti Digestivi Ospedalieri (AIGO) PBC Task Force; Sicilian PBC Network; PBC Project Piemonte-
Liguria-Valle  D'Aosta.  The  Global  PBC  registry  included  non-OCA-treated  patients  who  met  the  same 
study inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
Inclusion criteria included: age ≥18 years; PBC diagnosis per European Association for the Study of the 
Liver (EASL) guidelines; taking UDCA for at least 12 months or intolerant to UDCA; ALP≥1.5x ULN and/ 
or 1 mg/dL <total bilirubin <2 mg/dL; treated with OCA for at least 6 months. Exclusion criteria included: 
Child-B or Child-C classification; previous decompensation event. The Global PBC cohort also excluded 
patients with hepatic comorbidities: hepatitis C; active hepatitis; primary sclerosing cholangitis; alcoholic 
liver disease. Patients in the Italian registries had an OCA-initiation index dates from 2016 through 2021. 
Patients in the Global PBC controls had index dates between 2000 and 2016, and 1 date was randomly 
selected from eligible index dates as the control index.  
To  ensure  balance  between  the  OCA-treated  and  non-OCA-treated  groups,  a  logistic  regression,  with 
treatment  group  as  outcome  and  demographic,  laboratory,  disease  state  and  treatment  variables  as 
predictors,  was  used  to  generate  propensity  scores  (for  predictor  variables,  see  Figure  55).  The 
propensity  scores  were  used  to  generate  standardized  morbidity  ratio  weights,  applied  to  controls.  A 
standardized mean difference of +0.25 was prespecified as indicative of adequate balance on baseline 
variables.  
The primary efficacy analysis was an ITT analysis. Cox regression and log-rank test assessed the effect 
of  OCA-treatment  on  time  to  death  or  liver  transplant.  The  secondary  efficacy  analyses  assessed  the 
effect of OCA-treatment on time to death, liver transplant, or hepatic decompensation.  
Results  
After  applying  eligibility  criteria,  there  were  437  patients  in  the  OCA-treated  Italian  cohort  and  831 
controls patients from Global PBC. After weighting, all standardized mean differences were within the 
pre-specified +0.25 threshold (Figure 55) and groups were well balanced on all variables (Table 117).

There  was  a  statistically  significant  improvement  in time  to  death  or  liver  transplant  for  OCA-treated 
patients versus non-OCA-treated controls (HR=0.32; 95% CI 0.15, 0.66; p<0.0001) Figure 56. There 
was  a  similar  statistically  significant  improvement  in  time  to  death,  liver  transplant  or  hepatic 
decompensation  for  OCA-treated  patients  versus  non-OCA-treated  controls  (HR=0.33;  95%  CI  0.20, 
0.54; p<0.0001).

Conclusion  
This study, conducted independently from the MAH, used methods similar to those used in the MAH-
supported studies. The 68% reduction in relative risk of death or liver transplant, and 67% reduction in 
relative risk of death, liver transplant or hepatic decompensation are very similar to the effects observed 
in the MAH-supported studies.  
Summary of Real-world Evidence  
CHMP wrote: “…the MAH is requested to discuss why such remarkable differences are observed between 
the placebo controlled study and the RWE in order to better elucidate the value of these data.”  
Evidence  of  efficacy  needs  to  be  replicable  across  populations,  consistent  across  patient  subgroups, 
robust  in  the  face  of  varying  study  designs  and  analytic  approaches  and  observed  regardless  of  the 
scientific  organization  conducting  the  study.  The  real-world  studies  presented  used  data  from  the 
treatment arms of 2 randomized controlled trials (including 1 long-term safety extension), 1 global and 
2 European PBC registries, and a large US claims database supplemented with outcomes data from a 
national  transplant  and  death  registry.  The  populations  varied  from  early  to  late  in  PBC  disease 
progression. The designs differed from external controls to fully real-world; from random selection of 
control index dates to nested trial emulation allowing all eligible index dates to be included. IPTWs and 
SMRs  were used to balance treatment groups at baseline. Endpoints included transplant-free survival 
and  event-free  survival,  as  well  as  their  individual  components.  Numerous  sensitivity  analyses  were 
conducted. The studies were conducted in collaboration with the MAH, and independently.  
The treatment effects, summarized in Table 113, are remarkably consistent. Across studies, HRs ranged 
from  0.29  to  0.40  for  time-to-death  and  liver  transplant;  and  from  0.30  to  0.42  for  death,  liver 
transplant,  or  hepatic  decompensation.  The  size  of  the  treatment  effects  were  consistent  for  each 
component of the composite endpoint (death, liver transplant, and hepatic decompensation), i.e., the 
effects were not driven by a single component. The observed effects demonstrated treatment benefit in 
all studied subgroups, with the exception of male patients in Study 747-405 (in which the sample size 
was extremely small).  
The event rates in OCA-treated patients are very similar across studies, with slightly higher events in 
patients with more advanced PBC. The events rates in untreated patients were nearly superimposable 
for patients early in disease, and higher for patients with more progressed disease. Event rates increased 
as  the  endpoint  was  expanded  from  transplant-free  survival  to  event-free  survival  adding  hepatic 
decompensation, to event-free-survival adding hepatic decompensation and portal hypertension. These 
details are important for 2 reasons:  
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 316/319 
 
  
 
 
 
1. The data “behave” in a way that demonstrates a high level of construct validity. For example, if sicker 
patients  had  lower  observed  event  rates  than  healthier  patients,  one  could  legitimately  question  the 
validity of the data.  
2. The data demonstrate that the course of PBC disease is highly predictable, both for untreated patients 
and OCA-treated patients.  
These  58%  to  71%  reductions  in  the  relative  risk  of  serious  clinical  events  of  all-cause  death,  liver 
transplants, and hepatic decompensation offer strong support that OCA treatment provides a clinically 
meaningful and significant benefit to appropriately treated PBC patients with a positive benefit:risk. We 
believe that CHMP should consider these results, in addition to those from 747-302, in their evaluation.  
Conclusions  
There are several reasons why the partial and fully real-world analyses differ from those of the clinical 
trial. Prior to the submission of the original MAA, the original MAH sought Follow-up Protocol Assistance 
from  CHMP  on  the  design  of  Study  747-302  (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/290154/2014).  Many  of  the  potential 
issues  that  both  the  MAH  and  CHMP  raised  and  discussed  have  become  apparent  during  the  study’s 
execution:  
•  Recruiting subjects on placebo in a rare disease trial, which was then exacerbated owing to the 
COVID-19 pandemic  
•  Maintaining subjects on placebo once commercial drug became available  
•  An  inability  to  expand  recruitment  to  countries  where  the  product  was  not  commercially 
available, largely owing to the COVID-19 pandemic  
• 
The majority of subjects included in Study 747-302 have advanced disease and are no longer 
indicated in the SmPC  
In addition, patients with PBC can easily monitor their disease progression, as ALP is part of standard 
routine blood chemistry panels. The MAH has also been informed by some investigators that they felt it 
was unethical to maintain subjects on investigational product who experienced disease progression when 
effective  commercial  treatment  was  available.  Some  subjects  randomized  to  placebo  who  progressed 
subsequently  crossed  over  to  active  treatment,  which  lowered  their  event  rates.  In  the  OCA-treated 
group, 65% of events occurred in subjects who had discontinued treatment, increasing events in that 
group.  Therefore,  the  effect  size  was  compromised,  and  ITT  analyses  prohibit  taking  this  bias  into 
account.  
Putting all of these issues together, the MAH believes that significant bias has, unfortunately, influenced 
the results in Study 747-302.  
The  original  MAH  highlighted  their  concerns  with  Study  747-302  during  their  interactions  with  CHMP 
during the  Annual  Renewals  in  2019,  2020  and  2021  and  sought  Scientific  Advice  in 2021  to  directly 
address the issues. Discussions also took place with FDA, who suggested expanding the endpoint in the 
study, thereby improving power, resulting in an improved hazard ratio. Similarly, when IPCW was applied 
to  the  primary  analysis  to  reduce  bias,  the  hazard  ratio  improved  and  indicated  benefit.  However, 
residual bias remained, compromising treatment effect.  
The  real-world  studies  that  have  been  undertaken  on  behalf  of  the  MAH  and  also,  separately,  by  an 
independent  group,  utilized  various  techniques  described  in  the  reports  to  minimize  bias.  The  PBC 
patients in these studies are reflective of those who have been prescribed Ocaliva since its approval in 
2016  and  the  MAH  believes  represent  the  true  treatment  effect.  That  treatment  benefit  is  consistent 
across study populations, patient subgroups, study design and analysis, and was maintained throughout 
extensive sensitivity analyses. Combining the results seen with both the randomised control study, with 
EMA/528620/2023  
Page 317/319 
 
  
 
 
all its flaws, and the real-world studies makes it possible to conclude that it is reasonable to conclude 
that  there  is  a  positive  benefit:risk  for  Ocaliva  for  those  PBC  patients  for  whom  there  are  no  other 
treatment options. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH's initial comment that the real-world evidence (RWE) is not a "substitute" for the 747-302 
study is welcomed. However, the MAH has provided a number of complementary analyses and their 
conclusions are consistent not only in supporting the benefit-risk assessment of OCA, but also in 
overcoming the results of the randomised comparisons from the conducted trials. 
The discussion on the potential bias (and/or its uncertainty) due to crossover has been addressed in 
the answer to question 8. There are still uncertainties about the frequency and timing of 
discontinuation of treatment, study visits and the trial, and in fact, the results do not suggest an 
overall higher rate in the placebo group, but quite the opposite. This further supports the view that the 
IPCW analysis can only be considered as a post-hoc exploratory analysis for hypothesis generation, 
where a treatment policy strategy was predefined as the primary analysis in the 747-302 failed trial. 
This analysis cannot be considered more important than the prespecified confirmatory analysis, and in 
fact, despite being more in the MAH's expected positive direction, it was still very far from statistical 
significance (HR [95%CI]: 0.82 [0.53, 1.27]). 
Overall, all analyses provided based on RWE were quite more positive, and some of them showed 
statistical significance in favour of OCA. Notably, some of the MAH's comments are aimed at justifying 
the invalidity of the placebo test group, which is also the basis for justifying the use of external 
controls. This has been discussed in several previous questions, in particular it has been extensively 
addressed in answer to question 1. In essence, the regulatory assessment has concluded that despite 
the fact that the current estimation of the treatment effect might be confounded to some extent, 
should this occur it would be in both treatment arms and not just in placebo. Therefore, any post-hoc 
external comparison to overcome the failed trial results is invalid, especially as the RWE results are 
very far from the results of a randomised comparison. Furthermore, in contrast to the trial, MELD could 
not be assessed in the EC comparison as a measure of baseline balance and as a component of the 
primary endpoint, and notably, patients were censored at the occurrence of an ICE, which was handled 
in the trial using the treatment policy strategy for the primary assessment.  
Finally, propensity score methods are useful tools for balancing for prognostic factors, but unlike 
randomisation, they only allow adjustment for known and measured factors, so that they will never 
overcome the effect of randomisation. The MAH states that the treatment effects were remarkably 
consistent, but the divergence from the trial results only points out that there is a remarkable 
divergence due to the lack of a randomised comparison and that there is a very high risk of residual 
confounding in the baseline balance and during the follow-up. As a result of this, the risk-benefit 
assessment of OCA in the treatment of PBC will be mainly based on the results of the trials, and the 
RWE is considered only as complementary and exploratory with a much lower level of evidence than 
the trial results. 
Conclusion 
Issue not further pursued.

13.  2nd Request for supplementary information to be 
addressed in the oral explanation 
Major objections 
1.  The confirmatory study 747-302 has failed to demonstrate the clinical benefit of OCA treatment 
in reducing the risk of relevant clinical outcomes in patients with PBC, regardless of liver disease 
severity. The absence of improvement of liver histology further corroborates these findings. The 
results submitted from the external control studies/analyses, based on RWD, are not considered 
a  sound  piece  of  evidence  valid  to  counterbalance  for  the  negative  results  of  a  RCT. 
Consequently, the SOB#1, aimed to address the main efficacy uncertainty at the time of granting 
a  CMA,  i.e.  to  what  extent  those  changes  in  biochemical  parameters  correlate  with  a  risk 
reduction in relevant clinical liver outcomes in PBC patients and thus, the actual benefit of OCA 
treatment is not demonstrated. Therefore, this type II variation requesting a switch from CMA 
to  a  full  MA  is  not  approvable,  and  the  proposed  amendments  of  the  SmPC  (including  also  a 
restriction  of  the  indication)  cannot  be  agreed  with  in  view  of  the  concerns  raised  on  the 
demonstration of efficacy and safety in the whole target population. 
14.  Oral explanation 
The MAH addressed the Major objection in an oral explanation to the CHMP reiterating largely previous 
argumentation  that  the  failure  of  study  742-302  could  be  explained  by  bias  also  referring  to  results 
generated  in  RWE  studies.  The  MAH  agreed  that  the  switch  from  a  conditional  to  a  full  marketing 
authorisation is not approvable at present and proposed a registry study as a follow up specific obligation, 
a drug utilisation study and the implementation of further risk minimisation measures to maintain the 
benefit risk balance positive within this CMA. The oral explanation did not change the CHMPs negative 
opinion on the outcome of this variation procedure as outlined in the assessment report.

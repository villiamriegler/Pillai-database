the concomitant therapies.
Patients  should  be  treated  with  KEYTRUDA  until  disease  progression  or 
unacceptable toxicity (and up to maximum duration of therapy if specified for 
an indication). Atypical responses (i.e. an initial transient increase in tumour size 
or small new lesions within the first few months followed by tumour shrinkage) 
have  been  observed.  It  is  recommended  to  continue  treatment  for  clinically 
stable  patients  with  initial  evidence  of  disease  progression  until  disease 
progression is confirmed.
For the adjuvant treatment of melanoma, NSCLC, or RCC, KEYTRUDA should 
be administered until disease recurrence, unacceptable toxicity, or for a duration 
of up to one year.
For the neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment of TNBC, patients should be treated 
with neoadjuvant KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy for 8 doses 
of 200 mg every 3 weeks or 4 doses of 400 mg every 6 weeks or until disease 
progression that precludes definitive surgery or unacceptable toxicity, followed 
by adjuvant treatment with KEYTRUDA as monotherapy for 9 doses of 200 mg 
every 3 weeks or 5 doses of 400 mg every 6 weeks or until disease recurrence or 
unacceptable  toxicity.  Patients  who  experience  disease  progression  that 
precludes definitive surgery or unacceptable toxicity related to KEYTRUDA as

PART II: SAFETY SPECIFICATION
PART II: MODULE SI - EPIDEMIOLOGY OF THE INDICATION(S) AND 
TARGET POPULATION(S)
Melanoma
Incidence and prevalence: 
Over 80% of the world’s 287,700 annual new cases of melanoma occur in Australia, Europe, 
or North America [Ref. 5.4: 05DXHB]. Incidence varies according to geographic latitude, with 
the highest rates (per 100,000) found in Australia and New Zealand (33.6) and lowest in South-
Central Asia (0.3) [Ref. 5.4: 05DXHB]. In Europe, incidence (per 100,000) ranges from 5.3 in 
the Central/Eastern region to 18.8 in Western countries, with 144,209 incident cases expected 
in  2018  [Ref. 5.4: 05DXHB].  In  the  United  States  (US),  incidence  is  22.2  per  100,000, 
corresponding  to  96,480  new  cases  in  2019  [Ref. 5.4: 05DN03].  The  5-year  prevalence  in 
Europe is 494,111 cases [Ref. 5.4: 05DXHB]. 
Demographics of the indication population and risk factors for the disease: 
Although melanoma incidence increases by age worldwide with a median age at diagnosis of 
65 years [Ref. 5.4: 05DN03], it is one of the most common cancers among adolescents and 
young adults [Ref. 5.4: 05DR9D]. Incidence is higher for females until age 45-55, after which 
rates  are  higher  among  males  [Ref. 5.4: 04KB3D,  03MS03].  Risk  factors  include  fair  skin, 
multiple dysplastic nevi, and family history of melanoma; ultraviolet light also plays a role 
[Ref. 5.4: 03MS0N]. 
The main existing treatment options
Most patients with early-stage disease will be cured by excision [Ref. 5.4: 05DLL8]. Adjuvant 
radiation  therapy  may  be  used  for  select  patients  with  positive  nodes  or  other  features 
predicting  high  risk  of  relapse.  For  metastatic  or  unresectable  melanoma,  multiple  targeted 
therapies  have  been  FDA-approved,  including  immune  checkpoint  inhibitors,  BRAF  V600 
targeted  treatment,  and  BRAF/MEK  combinations.  Several  drugs  within  these  classes  have 
been approved in the adjuvant setting. 
Natural history of the indicated condition, including mortality and morbidity:
Mortality rates (per 100,000) are highest in Australia and  New Zealand (3.4) and lowest in 
South-Central  Asia  (0.19)  [Ref. 5.4: 05DXHB].  In  Europe,  mortality  (per  100,000)  ranges 
from 1.5 in the Southern region to 2.0 in Northern countries, with 27,147 deaths expected in 
2018 [Ref. 5.4: 05DXHB]. In the US and Europe, the 5-year relative survival is 92% and 83%, 
respectively [Ref. 5.4: 04KJJL, 05DN03]. Stage-specific overall survival varies across Europe, 
as follows: 95%–100% (stage I), 65%–92.8% (stage II), 41%–71% (stage III), and 9%–28% 
(stage IV) [Ref. 5.4: 05DRW3]. 
 
 
Important co-morbidities
Most melanomas occur among adults over age 50 [Ref. 5.4: 05DN03] for whom there is an 
increased risk of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes, and secondary cancers 
compared to younger adults [Ref. 5.4: 057XQG]. A higher prevalence of comorbidity may be 
associated with higher melanoma stage [Ref. 5.4: 05DQKR, 03N0KS]. 
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
Incidence and prevalence: 
Approximately  2,206,771  new  lung  cancer  cases  were  diagnosed  worldwide  in  2020 
[Ref. 5.4: 07XQ8W],  with  greater than  80%  of  all  lung  cancers being classified  as  NSCLC 
[Ref. 5.4: 05HV4Z]. Globally, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed tumor type 
(11.4%),  second  only  to  breast  cancer  (11.7%)  [Ref. 5.4: 07XQ8W] and  incidence  varies 
widely  with  smoking  prevalence  [Ref. 5.4: 05QDW7].  The  age-standardized  incidence  rate 
(per 100,000) of NSCLC (with appropriate proportions applied (80%)) [Ref. 5.4: 05QDW7] is 
highest in Polynesia/Micronesia (29.4), Eastern Asia (27.5), and North America (26.1); rates 
are lowest in most of Africa (5.0) [Ref. 5.4: 05QDW7]. In Europe, NSCLC incidence ranges 
from 21.5 in Central/Eastern countries to 26.2 in the Western region, with 382,027 new cases 
expected in 2020 [Ref. 5.4: 05QDW7]. The 5-year prevalence of NSCLC in Europe is 466,339 
cases [Ref. 5.4: 05QDW7]. In the US, NSCLC incidence is 26.5 per 100,000, corresponding 
to 182,300 new cases in 2020, with a 5-year prevalence of 236,210 cases [Ref. 5.4: 05QDW7]. 
Demographics of the indication population and risk factors for the disease: 
Lung  cancer  is  most  frequently  diagnosed  between  the  ages  of  65  and  74  years 
[Ref. 5.4: 058TT3]. In both the US and across Europe, incidence and mortality rates are higher 
in men than women [Ref. 5.4: 05QDW7], with incidence rising in women [Ref. 5.4: 05DQP9].
Tobacco exposure is the primary risk factor for developing lung cancer [Ref. 5.4: 05DQP9]
and two-thirds of lung cancer deaths are attributable to smoking [Ref. 5.4: 05QDW7].
The main existing treatment options
Surgery  provides  the  best  chance  for  a  cure  among  patients  with  stage  I  or  II  disease 
[Ref. 5.4: 05DMDQ].  Chemoradiation  may 
locally  advanced 
unresectable  disease.  Patients  with  metastatic  disease  may  achieve  improved  survival  and 
palliation  of  symptoms  with  chemotherapy  (typically  a  platinum  doublet),  targeted  agents, 
checkpoint inhibitors, and other supportive measures combined or alone.

for 
Natural history of the indicated condition, including mortality and morbidity:
Worldwide, lung cancer was the leading cause (18.0%) of all cancer deaths (1.8 million) in 
2020 [Ref. 5.4: 05QDW7]. In  Europe,  the  age-standardized  mortality  rate  (per  100,000)  of 
NSCLC (with appropriate proportions applied (80%)) [Ref. 5.4: 05HV4Z] ranged from 16.1 
in Northern countries to 19.0 in the Western region [Ref. 5.4: 07XQ8W]. Lung cancer survival 
is  poor  in  Europe  with  1-year  and  5-year  relative  survival  of  39%  and  13%,  respectively 
[Ref. 5.4: 05DPLK]. 
 
 
Important co-morbidities:
As  lung  cancer  is  primarily  a  disease  of  the  aged  and  most  common  among  smokers, 
cardiovascular  disease  (CVD),  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  (COPD),  diabetes,  and  other 
in  NSCLC 
malignancies  are  expected 
[Ref. 5.4: 0439J6].
the  most  prevalent  comorbidities 
to  be 
Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL)
Incidence and prevalence: 
Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a rare lymphoid malignancy of B-cell origin involving the lymph 
nodes  and  lymphatic  system  [Ref. 5.4: 052ZM2].  There  are  two  major  variants  of  HL,  the 
uncommon nodular lymphocyte predominant (NLP) subtype (<10%) and the classical variety 
divided into four subtypes (lymphocyte-rich, 5%; nodular sclerosis, 70%; mixed cellularity, 
20-25%; or lymphocyte-depleted, <1%) [Ref. 5.4: 052ZM2]. The estimated new cases globally 
2018 was estimated to be 79,990 (1.0 per 100,000 world populations) [Ref. 5.4: 05DXHB]. 
Incidence (per 100,000) is highest in Southern (2.8) and Northern (2.6) Europe; rates are lowest 
in Eastern Asia (0.35) [Ref. 5.4: 05DXHB]. Nearly one quarter of the world’s HL cases are 
diagnosed  in  Europe,  where  an  estimated  19,193  new  cases  (2.4  per  100,000)  of  HL  were 
reported in 2018 [Ref. 5.4: 05DXHB]. The incidence of HL in European children 0-19 years 
of age is 1.3 per 100,000, yielding 2193 new cases in 2018 [Ref. 5.4: 05DXHB]. In the US, 
incidence is 2.7 per 100,000, corresponding to 8100 new cases in 2019; 12% of cases occur in 
persons under age 20 [Ref. 5.4: 05DMHL]. The 5-year overall prevalence in Europe is 77,315 
cases, with 6289 children ages 0-19 years [Ref. 5.4: 05DXHB]. 
Demographics of the indication population and risk factors for the disease: 
HL is more common in males and is most frequently diagnosed in young adults ages 20-34 
years [Ref. 5.4: 052ZM2]. HL is one of the few malignancies with shared features of biology 
and  natural  history  for  children  and  adults  [Ref. 5.4: 05G5VD].  Risk  factors  are  not  well 
described, but a viral etiology has long been hypothesized [Ref. 5.4: 052ZM2]. Epstein-Barr 
virus (EBV) is highly prevalent among HL patients and accounts for up to 40-50% of all global 
cases  [Ref. 5.4: 04HTK5].  However,  the  rate  of  EBV-positive  HL  varies  considerably  by 
geography  with  lower  a  prevalence  observed  in  North  America  (32%)  and  Europe  (36%) 
compared 
(56%) 
[Ref. 5.4: 04HTK5]. HL in young children is more likely to be EBV-associated compared to 
adolescents and young adults [Ref. 5.4: 05G5VD].
(74%),  Central/South  America 
(61%),  and  Asia 
to  Africa 
The main existing treatment options: 
Historically,  treatment  of  classical  HL  in  childhood  and  adults  generally  utilized  the  same 
strategy and agents, with high cure rates of at least 80% of patients overall; 90-95% of children 
can be cured [Ref. 5.4: 05DMDL, 05G5VD]. Current management of classical HL involves 
initial treatment with chemotherapy alone or combined with radiation therapy for early stage 
disease.  Several chemotherapy options and brentuximab vedotin are available for stage III-IV 
disease.  High-dose  salvage  chemotherapy  followed  by  autologous  stem  cell  transplantation 
and checkpoint inhibitors are options for refractory or relapsed disease. The NLP subtype is 
 
 
characterized  by  an  indolent  course  and  occasional  late  relapse;  most  patients  present  with 
early-stage  disease.  Radiation  therapy  is  the  preferred  treatment  for  early  stage  NLPHL; 
chemotherapy with or without rituximab/radiation is recommended for stage III-IV NLPHL. 
Natural history of the indicated condition, including mortality and morbidity:
[Ref. 5.4: 05DXHB].  The  overall  5-year  survival 
In 2018, 26,167 HL deaths (0.3 per 100,000) occurred in the world. Mortality (per 100,000) is 
highest in Northern Africa (0.63) and lowest in East Asia (0.13); in Europe, mortality ranges 
from 0.19 in Western countries to 0.43 in Central and Eastern region, resulting in 4307 deaths 
in  2018 
is  80.3% 
[Ref. 5.4: 05DPN4].  The  overall  5-year  survival  in  the  US  is  86.6%,  with  stage-specific 
survival as follows: 91.6% (stage I), 93.5% (stage II), 82.9% (stage III), and 73.5% (stage IV) 
[Ref. 5.4: 05DMHL].  Among  children  and  adolescents,  5-year  survival  is  more  than  95% 
[Ref. 5.4: 05G5VD]. Of the 1000 HL deaths expected in 2019 in the US, 0.9% occurred among 
persons under age 20 [Ref. 5.4: 05DMHL]. 
in  Europe 
Important co-morbidities:
Given the relatively young average age of HL patients, fewer common age-related comorbid 
conditions would be expected compared to patients with other cancers.
Urothelial Carcinoma
Incidence and prevalence:  
Urinary bladder cancer (UBC) comprises 90-95% of all urothelial carcinomas; the remaining 
are upper tract urothelial cancers [Ref. 5.4: 05DMLD]. Overall, the age standardized incidence 
of UBC (per 100,000) is 5.7 globally [Ref. 5.4: 05DXHB]. The age standardized incidence per 
100,000  persons  is  highest  in  Southern  Europe  (15.2)  and  lowest  in  Middle  Africa  (1.2) 
[Ref. 5.4: 05DXHB]. Rates are generally declining in developed countries and increasing in 
less developed regions [Ref. 5.4: 04GXQB]. In the US, there are 80,470 new cases of UCB 
expected  in  2019  [Ref. 5.4: 057K9G].  The  5-year  UBC  prevalence is  308,011  in  North 
America and 631,337 in Europe [Ref. 5.4: 05DXHB]. 
Demographics of the indication population and risk factors for the disease: 
UBC incidence is 3-5 times higher in males than females [Ref. 5.4: 05DXHB]. UBC usually 
occurs  among  older  adults;  the  median  age  at  diagnosis  is  73  years  in  the  US 
[Ref. 5.4: 057K9G].  Tobacco  consumption  is  a  significant  risk  factor  for  urothelial  cancer 
[Ref. 5.4: 05DMLD]. 
The main existing treatment options: 
Clinically, UBC classified as non-muscle-invasive (NMIBC) represents approximately 75% of 
newly  diagnosed  cases,  while 
remaining  25%  are  muscle-invasive  cancers
[Ref. 5.4: 059FM9]. See section below for NMIBC treatment. Standard treatment options for 
muscle-invasive  UBC  include  radical cystectomy  with  or  without  neoadjuvant  (cisplatin-
based)  or  adjuvant  therapies,  bladder-preserving  approaches,  and  systemic  therapy  for 
the 
 
 
advanced and metastatic disease. The FDA has approved PD-1 inhibitors for locally advanced 
or metastatic urothelial cancers. 
Natural history of the indicated condition, including mortality and morbidity:
Approximately 5% of UBC patients have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis; however, 
roughly half of all patients experience relapse after cystectomy, with distant metastases most 
common [Ref. 5.4: 059FM9]. Mortality rates (per 100,000) are highest in Northern Africa (4.4) 
and  lowest  in  Central  America  (0.75);  European  rates  range  from  2.6  (Northern)  to  3.2 
(Southern)  [Ref. 5.4: 05DXHB].  The  5-year  survival  by  UBC  stage  is  as  follows:  in  situ: 
95.8%, local: 69.5%, regional: 36.3%, distant: 4.6% [Ref. 5.4: 057K9G]. The overall 5-year 
UBC relative survival in Europe is 68% [Ref. 5.4: 04D76G].
Important co-morbidities:
As  bladder  cancer  is  primarily  a  disease  of  the  aged,  CVD,  COPD,  diabetes  and  other 
malignancies are expected to be the most prevalent comorbidities in patients with urothelial 
cancers [Ref. 5.4: 04H4GM, 04GXN0].
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC)
Incidence and prevalence: 
Head  and  neck  cancer  (HNC)  encompasses  a  heterogeneous  group  of  cancers  of  the  upper 
aero-digestive  tract,  including  the  oral  cavity,  salivary  glands,  pharynx,  and  larynx 
[Ref. 5.4: 04DP5M]. Cancers of the lip and oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx, 
which are primarily (>90%) comprised of squamous cell carcinoma histology, are collectively 
termed  head  and  neck  squamous  cell  carcinoma  (HNSCC)  [Ref. 5.4: 04DGDP,  04DP5M]. 
Worldwide,  HNSCC  incidence varies  widely  by  country  and  tumor  site;  the  most  common 
sites  in  Europe  are  lip  and  oral  cavity  (42%)  and  larynx  (27%).  Across  Europe,  combined 
HNSCC  age-standardized  incidence  (per  100,000)  ranges  by  region  from  8.5  (Southern 
Europe) to 11.8 (Central and Eastern Europe), corresponding to approximately 147,000 new 
cases  and  443,000  5-year  prevalent cases  in  2018  [Ref. 5.4: 05DXHB].  In  the  US, HNSCC 
age-standardized incidence is roughly 10 cases per 100,000 with 55,000 new cases expected 
in 2018 [Ref. 5.4: 05DRVZ, 0565YM]. 
Demographics  of  the  population  in  the  indication  population  and  risk  factors  for  the 
disease: 
HNC  occurs  most  often  among  adults  over  age  60  years  [Ref. 5.4: 057SQL,  05DMHM]. 
However, some oropharyngeal cancer cases are related to human papillomavirus (HPV) and 
tend to occur in younger adults [Ref. 5.4: 04DGDY]. Males are 2-3 times more likely to have 
HNSCC compared to females [Ref. 5.4: 05DXHB]. Tobacco and alcohol consumption are the
dominant 
larynx,

factors,  particularly 
for  cancers  of 
risk 
 
 
The main existing treatment options: 
HNSCC treatment is complex with specific site, stage and pathology directing management. 
Single-modality surgery or radiation therapy is generally recommended for early-stage disease 
[Ref. 5.4: 05DLLB].  Standard  options  for  locally  advanced  stage  III  or  IV  tumors  include 
surgery  plus  postoperative  radiotherapy.  Combined  concomitant  chemoradiation  may  be 
recommended post-operatively for high-risk features or unresectable tumors. Commonly used 
agents include cisplatin, carboplatin, paclitaxel, docetaxel, 5-FU, methotrexate, capecitabine, 
and cetuximab. For advanced, unresectable, metastatic or recurrent HNSCC, participation in 
clinical  trials  is  recommended.  Emerging  targeted  therapies  include  tyrosine  kinase  or 
checkpoint inhibitors. 
Natural history of the indicated condition, including mortality and morbidity:
Across European regions, combined HNSCC mortality rates range from 2.8 to 6.6 per 100,000 
[Ref. 5.4: 05DXHB]. In Europe, five-year survival ranges from 33-44%, with the majority of 
cases  diagnosed  at  stage  III  or  IV  [Ref. 5.4: 04SRJJ].  Patients  with  HPV-associated  HNC 
generally  have  an

Important co-morbidities:
Studies  of  HNSCC  patients in  Europe  found  the  most  common  co-morbidities  to  be 
cardiovascular  disease,

asthma/COPD,  diabetes, 
liver  disease, 
Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)
Incidence and prevalence: 
The age-standardized incidence of kidney cancer (per 100,000) is highest in North America 
(12.2)  and  Northern  Europe/Australia  and  New  Zealand (10.3);  rates  are  lowest  in  Middle 
Africa (1.0) [Ref. 5.4: 06C8B2]. More than one-third of incident cases occur in Europe, with 
nearly 139,000 incident cases expected in 2020 [Ref. 5.4: 06C86L]. In the US, kidney cancer 
incidence is anticipated to be 16.4 per 100,000, yielding roughly 76,000 new cases in 2021
[Ref. 5.4: 06C86L]. Approximately 85% of all primary kidney cancers are comprised by RCC, 
and approximately 70% have clear cell histology, [Ref. 5.4: 05DMDM]. RCC incidence has 
increased  over  the  last  few  decades  in  the  US  and  most  of  Europe  [Ref. 5.4: 05BFQQ, 
04BN0K].  The  5-year  prevalence  of  kidney  cancer 
is  405,983 cases 
[Ref. 5.4: 06C8B2].
in  Europe 
Demographics of the indication population and risk factors for the disease: 
Kidney cancer incidence increases by age with a median age at diagnosis of 64 years in the US 
[Ref. 5.4: 06CL4Y]. In most countries, it is roughly twice as common among males compared 
to  females  [Ref. 5.4: 06C8B2].  Established  risk  factors  for  RCC  include  obesity,  smoking, 
hypertension,  and  chronic  kidney  disease;  other  probable  risk  factors  include  low  physical 
 
 
activity,  diabetes,  occupational  chemical  exposure,  radiation  exposure,  and  analgesic  use
[Ref. 5.4: 05DPRK, 053GXR, 053GXZ, 053GY2].
The main existing treatment options: 
Surgical resection is the primary treatment for localized disease [Ref. 5.4: 05DMDM]. There 
is  little  evidence  of  benefit  with  adjuvant  therapy  for  most  patients  with  locally  advanced 
disease.  Approved  and  emerging  targeted  therapies  for  advanced  or  relapsed  RCC  include 
checkpoint  inhibitors,  anti-vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  (VEGF)  antibodies,  tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors (TKI), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein inhibitors. 
Natural history of the indicated condition, including mortality and morbidity:
Worldwide,  kidney  cancer  age-standardized  mortality  rates  (per  100,000)  are  highest  in 
Central/Eastern  Europe  (3.4)  and  Western  Europe  (2.8);  54,000  deaths  occurred  in  Europe 
during 2020 [Ref. 5.4: 06C8B2]. Prognosis has improved significantly in the US and Europe, 
due in part to the advent of TKI therapy [Ref. 5.4: 053TKZ, 05BFQQ]. The majority (65%) of 
kidney  cancers  diagnosed  in  the  US  is  localized  and  16%  of  tumors  are  metastatic 
[Ref. 5.4: 06CL4Y].  The  overall  5-year  survival  in  Europe  and  the  US  is  60%  and  76%, 
respectively [Ref. 5.4: 06CL4Y, 04D76G]. Clear cell histology, accounting for the majority of 
RCC, is associated with a better prognosis than non-clear cell RCC [Ref. 5.4: 053GY0]. 
Important co-morbidities:
Cardiovascular  or  cerebrovascular  diseases,  hypertension,  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary 
disease, diabetes, and other prevalent comorbidities among elderly populations are frequently 
observed in cancer patients [Ref. 5.4: 04VW4L].
Microsatellite Instability-High (MSI-H)/deficient MisMatch Repair (dMMR) Colorectal 
Cancer (CRC)
Incidence and prevalence: 
The  prevalence  of  MSI-H/dMMR status  varies  widely  by  tumor  type  and  disease  stage 
[Ref. 5.4: 04TCGC,  04TCK9].  MSI-H/dMMR is  present  in  approximately  15%  of  all 
colorectal cancer [Ref. 5.4: 04TC0P]. MSI-H/dMMR is more common among stage II (~20%) 
than  stage  III  (~12%)  colorectal  cancer  and  is  least  frequent  in  stage  IV  (~4%)  disease 
[Ref. 5.4: 04TC0P].
Demographics of the indication population and risk factors for the disease:
Lynch  Syndrome  results  from  germline  mutations  in  mismatch  repair  (MMR)  genes  and 
accounts  for  a  small  portion  of  MSI-H/dMMR colorectal  cancers;  the  majority  of  MSI-
H/dMMR tumors arise in the sporadic form [Ref. 5.4: 04TC0P].  Few consistent differences 
have  been  observed  for  the  association  between  MSI  status  and  lifestyle  factors  among 
colorectal  cancer  patients  [Ref. 5.4: 05FB0L].  However,  some  studies  report  a  higher 
proportion  of  MSI-H/dMMR tumors  for  current  smokers  [Ref. 5.4: 04W005,  05FB0L] and 
 
 
those  with  a  family  history  of  colorectal  cancer  [Ref. 5.4: 04VYPZ,  04W02X].  BRAF 
mutations are more common in MSI-H/dMMR colorectal patients [Ref. 5.4: 04VWL2]. 
The main existing treatment options: 
Pembrolizumab was approved in the US to treat MSI-H or MMR deficient colorectal cancer 
following progression on a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan treatment. Prior to the 
approval  of  pembrolizumab,  there  were  no  FDA-approved  therapies  specifically  for  the 
treatment  of  MSI-H/dMMR  cancers  and  the  standard  of  care  consisted  of  chemotherapy 
regimens and palliative care if response was not achieved. Nivolumab (as a single agent or in 
combination  with  ipilimumab)  is  approved  for  MSI-H  or  dMMR  metastatic  CRC  that  has 
progressed  following  treatment  with  a  fluoropyrimidine,  oxaliplatin,  and  irinotecan 
[Ref. 5.4: 05DLL7]. Routine testing for MMR deficiency or MSI status is recommended for 
all patients with colorectal cancers [Ref. 5.4: 05DLL7].  
Natural history of the indicated condition, including mortality and morbidity:
Sporadic  MSI-H/dMMR colorectal  cancer  is  generally  associated  with  lower  stage  at 
diagnosis,  larger  tumor  size,  proximal  colon  predominance,  wildtype  p53  status,  poor 
differentiation, mucinous histology, and less metastasis [Ref. 5.4: 04VZ0J, 04VWL8]. MSI-
H/dMMR colorectal cancer patients have a survival advantage limited to those with localized 
disease  [Ref. 5.4: 04VZ0J,  043SX8].  In  contrast,  mCRC  patients  with  MSI-H/dMMR  had 
worse  survival  and  poor  prognosis  compared  to  microsatellite  stable  (MSS) mCRC 
[Ref. 5.4: 043VF3].
Important co-morbidities:
Co-morbidity  prevalence  among  MSI-H/dMMR cancer  patients  is  unknown.  However,  co-
morbidities are common among cancer patients, particularly with older adults for whom cancer 
is  most  common  [Ref. 5.4: 04VW4L].    Secondary  tumors  or  multiple  primary have  been 
reported  among  MMR  deficient  and  MSI-H  colorectal  cancer  patients  [Ref. 5.4: 04W654, 
04VZ03].
Esophageal Cancer
Incidence and prevalence: 
Over 77% of the 572,034 new esophageal cancer cases diagnosed worldwide occur in Asia 
[Ref. 5.4: 05DXHB]. The highest age-standardized incidence rates (per 100,000) are found in 
Eastern  Asia  (12.2)  and  the  lowest  are  in  Central  America  (0.96)  [Ref. 5.4: 05DXHB].  In 
Europe, nearly 53,000 new cases were diagnosed in 2018; incidence rates range from 3.0 in 
Central/Eastern countries to 5.5 in Northern Europe [Ref. 5.4: 05DXHB]. In the US, incidence 
is  4.3  per  100,000,  with  17,650  new  cases  in  2019  [Ref. 5.4: 05DMHK].  Squamous  cell 
carcinoma is the predominant histologic subtype worldwide; however, adenocarcinoma is most 
frequently  diagnosed  in  the  US  and  much  of  Europe  [Ref. 5.4: 054HBS].  The  5-year 
prevalence in Europe is approximately 56,000 cases [Ref. 5.4: 05DXHB]. 
 
 
Demographics of the indication population and risk factors for the disease: 
Esophageal cancer incidence increases with age, with a median age at diagnosis of 68 years in 
the US [Ref. 5.4: 05DMHK]. In most regions, including the US and Europe, males have a 3-
to 5-fold higher incidence compared to females [Ref. 5.4: 05DXHB]. Smoking is the primary 
risk  factor  for  the  squamous  cell  carcinoma  subtype,  but  alcohol  use,  poor  nutrition,  and 
infectious  agents  have  also  been  implicated  [Ref. 5.4: 054HBS].  Gastroesophageal  reflux 
disease  occurs  in  10-20%  of  adults  in  Western  countries  and  is  a  major  risk  factor  for 
adenocarcinoma,  either  directly  or  through  an  intermediate  pre-malignant  lesion,  Barrett’s 
esophagus [Ref. 5.4: 054HBS]. 
The main existing treatment options: 
Surgery is the standard treatment for limited disease [Ref. 5.4: 05DLL9]. For locally advanced 
disease,  preoperative  treatment  with  chemotherapy  or  chemoradiation  therapy  is  indicated. 
Patients  with  unresectable,  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  disease,  particularly  those  with 
adenocarcinoma, may consider different palliative treatment options, including brachytherapy 
or  chemotherapy.  A  trastuzumab-containing  regimen  may  be  indicated  for  some  HER2-
positive tumors. Other approved or emerging targeted therapies include vascular endothelial 
growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) antibodies and checkpoint inhibitors. 
Natural history of the indicated condition, including mortality and morbidity:
In Europe, mortality rates (per 100,000) range from 1.5 in Southern Europe to 4.3 in Northern 
Europe [Ref. 5.4: 05DXHB]. The overall 5-year survival in the US and Europe is 19.9% and 
9-21%,  respectively  [Ref. 5.4: 05DMHK,  054HM8].  Most  cases  are  diagnosed  at  regional 
(32%) or distant (40%) stage, contributing to the poor overall survival [Ref. 5.4: 05DMHK]. 
Important co-morbidities:
Most esophageal cancers occur among adults over age 60 years who have an increased risk of 
cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes, and second primary malignancies, such 
as cancers of the oropharynx, lung and stomach [Ref. 5.4: 054HS0].
Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)
Incidence and prevalence: 
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer (BC) defined 
by an absence of expression of the estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor, and by absence 
of  overexpression  or  amplification  of  the  human  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor  2 
[Ref. 5.4: 059X3Q].  TNBC  comprises  15-20%  of  all  BC,  with infiltrating ductal  carcinoma 
(not  otherwise 
for  approximately  92%  of  TNBC  cases 
[Ref. 5.4: 059PJL]. Data on the incidence and prevalence rates of TNBC are scarce. Based on 
overall BC incidence (per 100,000) for the world, US and Europe, the estimated number of 
annual TNBC cases is roughly 365,000, 91,000, and 47,000, respectively [Ref. 5.4: 05DXHB]
[Ref. 5.4: 059RH3].  
specified)  accounting 
 
 
Demographics of the indication population and risk factors for the disease: 
TNBC is most common in young, pre-menopausal patients; although BC incidence generally 
increases with age, the proportion of BC cases categorized with the TNBC subtype decreases 
with age [Ref. 5.4: 05DNTY]. In the US, women of African ancestry are twice as likely to have 
the TNBC subtype compared to other women with BC [Ref. 5.4: 05DNTY]. TNBC etiology 
is  not  well  understood.  Compared  to  other BC  subtypes,  TNBC  has  a  higher  prevalence  of 
BRCA1  or  BRCA2  germline mutations.  The  reproductive  factors  generally  associated with 
increased BC risk, such as increased parity, younger age at first birth, older age at menarche, 
and oral contraceptive use, are not strongly linked to TNBC risk [Ref. 5.4: 05DQP0]. 
The main existing treatment options: 
The standard of care for TNBC continues to be conventional chemotherapy and radiation as 
with BC in general; optimal regimens for TNBC have yet to be established. For women with 
metastatic  breast  cancer,  including  TNBC,  who  have  germline  BRCA  mutations,  PARP 
inhibitors may be considered. For PD-L1 expressing metastatic TNBC, PD-L1 inhibitors in 
combination with chemotherapy are newer options.
Management of  early-stage  breast  cancer  has  been  based  on  use  of  systemic  chemotherapy 
given  prior  to  (neoadjuvant  therapy,  NAC)  or  after  (adjuvant  therapy)  definitive  surgery 
according to NCCN and ESMO guidelines [Ref. 5.4: 05MDND, 05B2QG]. Patients with high-
risk,  early-stage  TNBC  who  are  eligible  for  NAC  are  primarily  treated  with  taxane- and 
anthracycline-based  chemotherapy  regimens.  Until  recently,  radiation  therapy  was  the  only 
adjuvant treatment option, if clinically indicated, for patients who received chemotherapy prior 
to surgery. Capecitabine has been added as a recommended adjuvant treatment for patients not 
achieving pathological complete response (pCR) following NAC.
Natural history of the indicated condition, including mortality and morbidity:
Important characteristics of TNBC are high proliferation and frequent metastasis to visceral 
organs  and  brain;  TNBC  tumors  have  the  highest  recurrence  rates  compared  to  other  BC 
subtypes [Ref. 5.4: 05DNRG]. Compared to other hormonal and HER2 subtypes, TNBC has 
the poorest survival and prognosis is consistently lower at each disease stage; TNBC 3-year 
survival ranges from 94% for stage IA disease to 20% for stage IV [Ref. 5.4: 05DNNW]. 
Important co-morbidities:
Data describing specific co-morbidities among TNBC patients are scarce. A recent study of 
more 
reported  82%  with  no  comorbid  conditions 
[Ref. 5.4: 05DRW2].
than  50,000  TNBC  patients 
Endometrial Carcinoma
Incidence and prevalence: 
The  incidence  (per  100,000)  of  carcinoma  of  the  uterine  corpus,  often  referred  to  as 
endometrial carcinoma, is highest in North America (20.5) and lowest in South-Central Asia
 
 
(2.5) [Ref. 5.4: 05DXHB]. In Europe, incidence (per 100,000) ranges from 12.3 in Western 
countries to 19.0 in the Central/Eastern region, yielding roughly 122,000 new cases in 2018 
[Ref. 5.4: 05DXHB]. The incidence in the US is 27.5 per 100,000 women with nearly 62,000 
new cases expected in 2019 [Ref. 5.4: 057Y2L]. The 5-year prevalence in Europe is 445,805 
cases [Ref. 5.4: 05DXHB]. 
Demographics of the indication population and risk factors for the disease: 
Endometrial carcinoma is most frequently diagnosed among women aged 45-74 years with a 
median  age  at  diagnosis  of  63  years  in  the  US  [Ref. 5.4: 057Y2L].  The  incidence  of 
endometrial  carcinoma  in  Europe  has  also  been  increasing  [Ref. 5.4: 04KB2V],  and  the 
estimated median age at diagnosis in 2020 was between 64-69 years [Ref. 5.4: 05Q3MX]. The 
main risk factors for endometrial carcinoma are related to endogenous and exogenous estrogen, 
including  excess  weight,  abdominal  fatness,  menopausal  estrogen  therapy,  early  age  at 
menarche, late menopause, nulliparity, and diabetes [Ref. 5.4: 04SXYB].
The main existing treatment options:
The  main  categories  for  delineating  treatment  include  disease  limited  to  the  uterus, 
involvement of the cervix, and suspected extrauterine disease [Ref. 5.4: 05DMDS]. Minimally 
invasive surgery is preferred for disease limited to the uterus, whereas radical hysterectomy is 
recommended for tumors with cervical involvement. Systemic therapy may be considered for 
those not suitable for surgery and certain adjuvant therapies may be selected based on patient 
risk  factors.  Multi-agent  chemotherapy  regimens  are  preferred  for  metastatic,  recurrent,  or 
high-risk  disease.  Targeted  therapies  are  currently  under  investigation;  bevacizumab  and 
temsirolimus  are  considered  appropriate  for  patients  who  have  progressed  on  previous
cytotoxic chemotherapy. 
Natural history of the indicated condition, including mortality and morbidity: 
In Europe, mortality (per 100,000) is highest in Central/Eastern countries (3.9) and lowest in 
the Western region (2.1) [Ref. 5.4: 05DXHB]. In the US, most cases (67%) are diagnosed as 
localized  tumors  with  21%  having  regional  disease  and  9%  diagnosed  at  distant  stage 
[Ref. 5.4: 057Y2L]. The  overall 5-year survival in the US and  Europe is 81% and 72-79%, 
respectively  [Ref. 5.4: 057Y2L] [Ref. 5.4: 05F2FK].  Despite  early  detection,  approximately 
13% of all endometrial carcinomas recur [Ref. 5.4: 04SJ3G]. 
Important co-morbidities:
Co-morbidities  are  common  among  patients  with  cancer,  particularly  in  older  adults 
[Ref. 5.4: 057XQG]. Most endometrial carcinoma occurs among women over age 55 for whom 
comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity, are common [Ref. 5.4: 057XM4].
 
 
MSI-H/ dMMR Solid tumors
Incidence and prevalence: 
The  prevalence  of  MSI-H/dMMR  status  varies  widely  by  tumor  type  and  disease  stage 
[Ref. 5.4: 04TCGC] [Ref. 5.4: 04TCK9]. The highest prevalence of MSI-H/dMMR is found 
in endometrial (20-30%) and gastric (20%) cancers [Ref. 5.4: 04TCGC] [Ref. 5.4: 04TCK9]
[Ref. 5.4: 04Q8R4].  MSI-H/dMMR  prevalence  in  small  intestinal  cancer  is  about  10% 
[Ref. 5.4: 04SRJK] [Ref. 5.4: 05PJBW] [Ref. 5.4: 05P545] [Ref. 5.4: 05PJBJ]. For most other 
cancers, 
is  well  below  5% [Ref. 5.4: 04TCGC]
[Ref. 5.4: 04TCK9] [Ref. 5.4: 04Q8R4]. Both pancreatic cancer and biliary cancer have a very 
[Ref. 5.4: 04TCGC]
low  MSI-H/dMMR 
[Ref. 5.4: 04SRJK]
[Ref. 5.4: 05PJ9H]
[Ref. 5.4: 05PJ0F].  MSI-H/dMMR  prevalence  is  generally  lower  for  more  advanced  stage 
tumors compared to low stage disease [Ref. 5.4: 04Q8R4].

the  prevalence  of  MSI-H/dMMR 
[Ref. 5.4: 05P545]
[Ref. 5.4: 05PJBJ]
Demographics of the indication population and risk factors for the disease:
Among patients with solid tumors, MSI-H/dMMR frequency generally increases with age and 
is higher for females [Ref. 5.4: 04VW8W]. Lynch Syndrome results from germline mutations 
in  mismatch  repair  genes  and  accounts  for  a  small  portion  of  MSI-H/dMMR  cancers;  the 
majority  of  MSI-H/dMMR  tumors  arise  in  the  sporadic  form  [Ref. 5.4: 04VWCZ].  Few 
consistent differences are observed for MSI-H/dMMR cancer patients compared to those with 
low MSI or MSS tumors with regard to common solid tumor risk factors [Ref. 5.4: 04VWCZ]
[Ref. 5.4: 04VW73]. 
The main existing treatment options: 
Pembrolizumab was approved in the US to treat unresectable or metastatic MSI-H and dMMR 
solid tumors that have progressed after prior treatment and for patients with no satisfactory 
alternative  treatment  options.  Otherwise,  MSI-H/dMMR  solid  tumors  are managed  with 
cancer-specific  standard-of-care  chemotherapeutic  treatments  regardless  of  MSI  status 
[Ref. 5.4: 05DMLF].  Routine testing for MMR deficiency or MSI status is recommended for 
all patients with endometrial (epithelial only) cancers or patients with other select solid tumors 
who may be candidates for anti-PD-1 treatment [Ref. 5.4: 05DMDS].  
Natural history of the indicated condition, including mortality and morbidity:
The  prognostic  effect of  MSI-H/dMMR  status  varies by  tumor  type.  MSI-H/dMMR  gastric 
cancer patients generally have an overall favorable prognosis including those with advanced 
disease, possibly due to these tumors having a lower ability to invade serosal layers and spread 
through  the  lymphatic  system  [Ref. 5.4: 04VWCZ].  In  contrast,  the  relationship  between 
MSI/MMR status and disease stage is less consistent for endometrial tumors; MSI-H/dMMR 
endometrial tumors are often associated with poorer survival [Ref. 5.4: 04FR9W]. 
 
 
Important co-morbidities:
Co-morbidity  prevalence  among  MSI-H/dMMR  cancer  patients  is  unknown.  However,  co-
morbidities are common among cancer patients, particularly with older adults for whom cancer 
is most common [Ref. 5.4: 04VW4L]. Secondary tumors or multiple primary tumors have been 
reported among MMR deficient and MSI-H endometrial cancer patients [Ref. 5.4: 04W654]
[Ref. 5.4: 04VZ03].
Cervical Cancer 
Incidence and Prevalence:
Data  from  GLOBOCAN  estimates  58,169  new  cases  of  cervical  cancer  with  an  age 
standardized  incidence  rate  of  10.7  per  100,000  in  Europe  in  2020  [Ref. 5.4: 06FRP5].
Incidence ranges from 6.8 per 100,000 in the Western European region to 16.0 per 100,000 in 
Central/Eastern countries [Ref. 5.4: 05DXHB].  The 5-year prevalence in Europe is 190,814 
cases [Ref. 5.4: 05DXHB].
Demographics of the indication population and risk factors for the disease:
is 
the  UK  with 
the  earliest  peak 
The global incidence of cervical cancer peaks at ages 50-54 [Ref. 5.4: 06FGNB]. The country 
with 
incidence  peaking  between  30-34  years 
[Ref. 5.4: 06FGNB]. The primary risk factor is persistent infection with certain types of human 
papillomavirus  (HPV) [Ref. 5.4: 04YDD6].  The  more  recent  widespread  implementation of 
the  preventive  HPV  vaccine  is  expected  to  contribute  to  the  continuing  decline  of  cervical 
cancer  incidence  [Ref. 5.4: 04SXYB].  In  contrast,  cervical  cancer  burden  remains  high  in 
many  low  and  middle-income  countries  without  established  vaccination,  screening,  and 
treatment programs [Ref. 5.4: 04YDDS].
The main existing treatment options:
treatment  of  early-stage  cervical  cancer 
The  primary 
is  surgery  or  radiotherapy 
[Ref. 5.4: 05DLL6].  Concurrent  chemo-radiotherapy  is  the  standard  of  care  for  locally 
advanced  disease.  For  advanced  disease,  primary  treatment  is  usually  platinum-containing 
chemotherapy. Targeted therapies, including pembrolizumab (in the US) and bevacizumab (in 
the EU and US), have an established role for selected metastatic cases.  
Natural history of the indicated condition, including mortality and morbidity:
Cervical cancer mortality is highly preventable with access to early screening and treatment 
[Ref. 5.4: 04YDD6]. In Europe, mortality rates (per 100,000) ranges from 2.1 (Northern) to 
[Ref. 5.4: 05DXHB]
6.1 
[Ref. 5.4: 06FGNB]. The 5-year survival in the US and Europe is 65.8% and 62%, respectively 
[Ref. 5.4: 057SCZ] [Ref. 5.4: 04QRV7].
(Central/Eastern)  with  nearly  26,000  deaths 
in  2018 
 
 
Important co-morbidities:
The  prevalence of  co-morbidities  among  cervical  cancer patients  is  relatively low,  possibly 
due  to  relatively  earlier  diagnosis  and  younger  average  age  at  diagnosis  compared  to  other 
cancers. Cohort studies in Europe reported 80-90% of patients having no recorded comorbidity 
[Ref. 5.4: 04YVTB] [Ref. 5.4: 04YVTL].
Relevant adverse events in target populations: 
Relevant adverse events to be anticipated in the aforementioned target populations exposed to 
immunotherapy are summarized below. The adverse events selected for inclusion are aligned 
with the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) section 4.8. 
Biliary Tract Carcinoma (BTC)
Incidence and Prevalence: 
BTC  arises  from  the  epithelial lining  of  the  biliary tree and  is  comprised  by  cancers of  the 
intrahepatic  or  extrahepatic  bile  ducts  (or  cholangiocarcinoma,  CCA),  and  gallbladder. 
Globally, the prevalence of BTC has risen by 35% from 2007 to 2017, resulting in 235,900 
prevalent cases [Ref. 5.4: 05FVMP].  In 2017, the global incidence rate for BTC was 2.71 per 
100,000  population,  with  approximately  210,878  new  cases  [Ref. 5.4: 07Z66G].  Incidence 
(per 100,000) is highest in Chile (10.38) and generally lowest (<1) in African or Middle Eastern 
countries.  In Europe, incidence (per 100,000) is higher in Eastern (6.3), Southern (5.4), and 
Central (4.3) regions compared to Northern regions (2.33.4) [Ref. 5.4: 07Z66C]. Intrahepatic 
CCA is on the rise in the US and Europe (partly due to changes in diagnosis and classification), 
while gallbladder cancer is declining [Ref. 5.4: 05PFKM, 07Z66H].  
Demographics of the indication population and risk factors for the disease: 
In Europe and the US, BTC is more common in women; incidence is higher for men in some 
regions of Asia [Ref. 5.4: 07Z667, 07Z66C, 07Z66G]. Many risk factors have been identified, 
though the relative strength of these factors varies somewhat by BTC subtype. These include 
bile  duct  cysts,  cholangitis,  cholelithiasis,  cirrhosis,  HBV/HCV,  nonalcoholic  fatty  livery 
disease  (NAFLD)/nonalcoholic  steatohepatitis  (NASH),  chronic  pancreatitis,  inflammatory 
bowel  disease,  H  pylori infection,  obesity,  liver  fluke  infections,  and  some  occupational 
exposures  or  genetic  factors;  however,  roughly  half  of  cases  are  diagnosed  without  any 
identifiable risk factors [Ref. 5.4: 05PFKM, 07Z66H]. 
The main existing treatment options: 
Surgical procedures or radiation may be options for localized BTC [Ref. 5.4: 07Z655]. Liver 
transplantation  is  potentially  curative  for  select  patients  with  locally  advanced  disease. 
Treatment options for advanced BTC include a combination of durvalumab plus gemcitabine 
and  cisplatin-based chemotherapy, gemcitabine- or  fluoropyrimidine-based  chemotherapy, 
inhibitors 
tumors,
pembrolizumab 
fluoropyrimidine-based  chemoradiation,  or  radiation  alone.  Potential  molecular  targets  for 
emerging therapies  to  treat  BTC  subtypes  include  NRAS,  BAP1,  ARID1A,  EGFR,  NTRK, 
for  MSI-H/dMMR 
inhibitors, 
FGFR2 
IDH 
 
 
BRAF  V600E,  KRAS,  HER2,  PIK3C2G,  STK11,  TP53,  and  TGFBR2 [Ref. 5.4: 0885WD, 
0885WH, 0885WN, 0885WP].
Natural history of the indicated condition, including mortality and morbidity:
Globally, mortality rates (per 100,000) vary widely from 0.8 in South Africa to 21.2 in Chile 
[Ref. 5.4: 05H5SD]. Survival is similarly poor for CCA and gallbladder cancer with a median 
survival  under  1  year  and  5-year  survival  rates  of  10%-20%  in  Europe  and  the  US 
[Ref. 5.4: 07Z66C,  07Z653].  Most BTC  is  diagnosed  at  a  late  stage  when  treatment  is  less 
effective [Ref. 5.4: 07Z667].  
Important co-morbidities:
Comorbidities are common as most patients are elderly. A study of 86,134 BTC cases found 
cholelithiasis, 
respectively 
[Ref. 5.4: 07Z669]. 
in  18%,  19%,  and  33%, 
liver  disease,  or  diabetes 
Gastric Cancer
Incidence and prevalence:
Nearly  75%  of  the  world’s  1,089,103  annual  new  gastric  cancer  (GC)  cases  occur  in  Asia 
[Ref. 5.4: 06D898].    Incidence  varies  globally,  with  the  highest  age-standardized  incidence 
rates  (per  100,000)  found  in  Eastern  Asia  (22.4);  rates  are  lowest  in  Southern  Africa  (3.3) 
[Ref. 5.4: 06D898].    In  Europe,  incidence  (per  100,000  PY)  ranges  from  4.6  in  Northern 
countries  to  11.3  in  the  Central/Eastern  region,  resulting  in  136,038  incident  cases  in  2020 
[Ref. 5.4: 06D898]. In the US, age-standardized incidence is 7.1 per 100,000, corresponding 
to 26,380 new cases expected in 2022 [Ref. 5.4: 08389Q]. The 5-year prevalence in Europe is 
213,013 cases [Ref. 5.4: 06D898].
Demographics of the indication population and risk factors for the disease:
Incidence  increases  with  age,  with  incidence  peaking  in  those  over  age  70  years 
[Ref. 5.4: 08097V].   Males have a roughly 2--fold higher incidence compared to females in 
the US and Europe [Ref. 5.4: 06D8F4] [Ref. 5.4: 06D898].  The primary risk factor for non-
cardia  (distal)  GC  (comprising  a  majority  of  cases)  is  Helicobacter  pylori  gastritis;  the 
reduction in H. pylori prevalence through eradication efforts is significantly contributing to the 
decline in GC incidence in the US and Europe [Ref. 5.4: 06D8FH].  The less common cardia 
(proximal)  subtype  is  suspected  to  be  related  to  obesity,  smoking,  and  gastro-esophageal 
reflux; incidence is increasing in the US and Europe [Ref. 5.4: 06D8FH].
The main existing treatment options:
Surgery is the primary treatment option for localized disease [Ref. 5.4: 06D8DM]. Combined 
modality  therapy  is  recommended  for  locoregional  disease;  options  include  peri- or  post-
operative chemotherapy and pre- or post-operative chemoradiation.  For unresectable, locally 
advanced and metastatic disease, first-line systemic therapy regimens with two cytotoxic drugs 
are preferred. A fluoropyrimidine combined with oxaliplatin is recommended for most patients 
 
 
who  are  HER2-negative,  whereas  trastuzumab  plus  chemotherapy  is  indicated  for  HER2-
positive metastatic  disease.  Dependent  upon  local  approval,  nivolumab  with  chemotherapy 
may  be  an  option  for  first-line  treatment,  regardless  of  PD-L1  status;  subsequent  lines  of 
therapy  may  include  ramucirumab  with  or  without paclitaxel;  single-agent  chemotherapy; 
dostarlimab  (dMMR  tumors);  pembrolizumab  (MSI-H/dMMR  or  TMB-high  tumors); 
entrectinib or  larotrectinib (NTRK  gene  fusion-positive  tumors);  or trifluridine and  tipiracil 
(recurrent/metastatic tumors).   
Natural history of the indicated condition, including mortality and morbidity:
Mortality rates (per 100,000) are highest in Eastern Asia (14.6) and lowest in North America 
(1.8);  rates  in  Europe  range  from  2.9  in  the  North  to  8.3  in  the  Central/Eastern  region 
[Ref. 5.4: 06D898].  In  Europe, overall  5-year  survival  ranges  from  18.3%  to  35.4% 
[Ref. 5.4: 08097L].  Most  US  cases  are  diagnosed  at regional  (25%)  or  distant  (37%)  stage, 
contributing to a relatively poor 5-year survival (33.3%) [Ref. 5.4: 08389Q].
Important co-morbidities:
A  large  study  of  12,612  GC  patients  reported  a  high  prevalence  of  co-morbidities  prior  to 
diagnosis;  the  most  common  chronic  conditions  were  hypertension  (60%),  coronary  artery 
disease  (30%),  diabetes  (23.6%),  COPD  (17%),  congestive  heart  failure  (16.4%),  and 
osteoarthritis (13.6%) [Ref. 5.4: 04KCJW].

PART II: MODULE SII - NON-CLINICAL PART OF THE SAFETY 
SPECIFICATION
Key safety findings from non-clinical studies and relevance to human usage: 
Table SII.1:
Summary of Important Safety Findings from Non-clinical 
Studies
Key Safety Findings (from non-clinical studies)
Relevance to Human Usage
No safety concerns for repeated administration.
Due to its mechanism of action, pembrolizumab may 
increase the risk of abortion and stillbirths if 
administered during pregnancy.
The potential development of immune-mediated 
adverse events is a known risk with pembrolizumab 
and is discussed in Section SVII.3.1.
Repeat-dose toxicity: None  
Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) was well-tolerated when 
administered intravenously (IV) to Cynomolgus monkeys at 
doses of 6, 40 and 200 mg/kg during the 1- and 6-month 
toxicology studies.  There were no findings of toxicological 
significance and the NOAEL was 200 mg/kg in both studies.  
The exposure multiple based on a predicted AUC0-tau of 3607.3 
µg.day/mL at the maximum anticipated clinical dose of 10 
mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W) and/or every 3 weeks (Q3W) was 
19-fold at the dose of 200 mg/kg based on the 6-month study.
Pregnancy:  Based upon data from the literature on the role of 
the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in maintaining pregnancy and on 
experimental results in murine models of allogeneic pregnancy a 
potential risk with the administration of pembrolizumab to 
women of childbearing potential has been clearly identified.  
Because the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays a fundamental role in 
maintaining immune tolerance to the fetus, it is anticipated that 
the inhibition of PD-1 during pregnancy by treatment with 
pembrolizumab will have adverse effects on the fetus, including 
increased risks of abortion and stillbirth [Ref. 5.4: 00VMR9, 
02CFKR, 02CFKT, 00VMXH].
Immune-mediated disease: Based on the mechanism of action of 
pembrolizumab a safety risk for immune-mediated adverse 
events has been identified.  The PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays an 
important role in mediating peripheral immune tolerance to self, 
therefore its inhibition may contribute to the development of 
immune-mediated adverse events.  [Ref. 5.4: 02CFKV, 
02CFKW, 02CFKX, 02CFKQ]. However in a T-dependent 
Antibody Response (TDAR) study in mice, neither immune-
mediated toxicity nor effects on the magnitude and kinetics of 
the primary and recall antibody responses to Hepatitis B vaccine 
were observed during treatment with anti-PD-1 in comparison to 
untreated control group [Ref. 4.2.3.7.7: TT151105FIN].
Conclusions on Non-clinical Data
Nonclinical toxicology studies in monkeys of up to 6-months in duration with pembrolizumab 
demonstrated  that  there  were  no  adverse  effects  at  exposure  multiples  of  19-fold  over  the 
maximum  clinical  dose  (10 mg/kg)  and  94 times  the  exposure  in  humans  at  the  dose  of 
2 mg/kg.  The exposure multiple between the NOAEL and a human dose of 200 mg was 74.  
No reproductive toxicity studies were conducted with pembrolizumab based upon the potential 
risk to reproduction that is clearly identified from experimental results in the literature.  Based 
on the mechanism of action of pembrolizumab, there is a potential risk of developing immune-
mediated adverse events, which is being evaluated in ongoing clinical trials. 
 
 
PART II: MODULE SIII - CLINICAL TRIAL EXPOSURE
The clinical trial exposure is presented only for the clinical trial datasets/indications that are 
included in this RMP.
Clinical Trial Exposure by Duration of Exposure
(PK)  and  pharmacodynamics 
KEYNOTE-001  (KN001)  is  a  multi-cohort  clinical  trial  evaluating  the  safety,  tolerability, 
(PD),  and  anti-tumor  activity  of 
pharmacokinetics 
pembrolizumab in patients with melanoma (naïve to or previously treated with IPI (IPI)) and 
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). The “All Melanoma” population consisted of cohorts 
B1  (IPI  naïve  or  IPI  treated),  B2  (IPI  refractory),  B3  (IPI  naïve  or  IPI  treated),  and  D  (IPI 
naïve). The NSCLC population consisted of cohort C (2 prior systemic therapy regimens) and 
cohort F (naïve to treatment, or, had one or more prior systemic treatment regimens). Study 
visits were every 2 or 3 weeks, dependent on dosing cycles, and patients remained on drug 
until  progressive  disease  or  other  protocol  defined  stopping  criteria  occurred  (e.g.,  as 
intercurrent illness that prevented further administration of treatment; or the patient withdrew 
consent). 
KEYNOTE-002  (KN002)  is  a  randomized,  Phase  II  study  of  pembrolizumab  compared  to 
chemotherapy  in  patients  with  advanced  melanoma.  Study  visits  were  every  2  or  3  weeks, 
dependent on dosing cycles, and patients remained on drug until progressive disease or other 
protocol defined stopping criteria occurred. 
KEYNOTE-006  (KN006)  is  a  multicenter,  randomized,  controlled,  open-label,  three-arm, 
Phase  III  trial  designed  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  two  dosing  regimens  of 
pembrolizumab  compared  to  IPI  in  patients  with  unresectable  or  metastatic  advanced 
melanoma who are IPI-naive. Subjects randomized to either of the pembrolizumab treatment 
arms  received  treatment  for  up  to  24  months  or  until  disease  progression  or  other  protocol 
defined stopping criteria occur.
KEYNOTE-010  (KN010)  is  a  multi-center,  worldwide,  randomized,  adaptively  designed 
Phase II/III trial of pembrolizumab at two dosing schedules versus docetaxel in subjects with 
NSCLC with PD-L1 positive tumors who have experienced disease progression after platinum-
containing systemic therapy.  Subjects randomized to either of the pembrolizumab treatment 
arms or docetaxel received treatment for up to 24 months or until disease progression or other 
protocol defined stopping criteria occur.
KEYNOTE-021 (KN021) is a multi-center, open-label, Phase I/II study of pembrolizumab
in combination with chemotherapy or immunotherapy in subjects with advanced/metastatic
NSCLC. The study consists of two parts with multiple cohorts; cohort A of Part 1 of the 
study  evaluated pembrolizumab  in  combination  with  carboplatin-paclitaxel in  subjects  with 
metastatic  squamous  NSCLC  who  have  not  previously  received  systemic  therapy  for 
metastatic disease.  Subjects were randomized 1:1 to either receive 2mg/kg of pembrolizumab 
or 10mg/kg combined with carboplatin and paclitaxel.  All subjects received up to a maximum 
of 4 cycles of carboplatin and paclitaxel. Treatment with pembrolizumab continued until a total 
of 35 treatment administrations or until disease progression or other protocol defined stopping 
 
 
criteria. Cohort C of Part 1 of the study determined the recommended Phase II dosage
(RP2D) of pembrolizumab in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed [standard of care 
(SOC)]. Part 2 of the study included a randomized comparison of carboplatin and pemetrexed
with or without pembrolizumab (Cohort G). Subjects randomized to the combination
received 4 cycles of carboplatin and continued maintenance pemetrexed with pembrolizumab
for up to 35 cycles or until disease progression or other protocol defined stopping criteria.
Subjects randomized to SOC received 4 cycles of carboplatin and continued maintenance
pemetrexed until disease progression or other protocol defined stopping criteria.

Phase  III  trial  of  pembrolizumab  adjuvant  treatment  in  subjects  with  high-risk  stage  III 
melanoma following complete surgical resection compared to placebo.  Eligible subjects were 
randomized into two treatment groups to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg fixed dose or placebo 
every 3 weeks for one year or up to 18 doses.  Subjects were stratified by stage (IIIA [> 1 mm 
metastasis] versus IIIB versus IIIC 1 to 3 positive lymph nodes versus IIIC >4 positive lymph 
nodes)  and geographical  region  (North  America,  European  countries,  Australia  and  other 
countries as designated).  After first disease recurrence, subjects have the option to participate 
in Part 2 of the study; a single treatment group to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg fixed dose 
every 3 weeks for up to 2 years or until occurrence of a withdrawal criterion. Subjects assigned 
to the placebo group in Part 1 who experience disease recurrence are offered to crossover to 
pembrolizumab in Part 2.  Subjects randomized to pembrolizumab in Part 1 are considered for 
re-treatment if their disease recurs >6 months after completing 1 year of adjuvant treatment.  
Re-challenge is optional and at the discretion of the Investigator.

Pediatric: 2 mg/kg IV Q3W up to a maximum of 200 mg Q3W) or placebo every 3 weeks for 
17 cycles. Participants were stratified as follows: one stratum for pediatric participants (≥12 
 
 
years of age and <18 years of age) and 3 strata for adult participants (≥18 years of age) based 
on  T-stage  tumor  thickness  and  ulceration  (T3b,  T4a,  T4b).  After  first  disease  recurrence, 
participants have the option to participate in Part 2 of the study; a single treatment group to 
receive up to 17 or 35 cycles of pembrolizumab therapy Q3W per Part 2 eligibility guidelines. 
KEYNOTE-426 (KN426) is a Phase III randomized, open-label study to evaluate efficacy and 
safety of pembrolizumab in combination with axitinib versus sunitinib monotherapy as a first-
line  treatment  for  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  renal  cell  carcinoma  (mRCC).    Eligible 
subjects  were  stratified  by the  International  Metastatic  Renal  Cell  Carcinoma  Database 
Consortium  (IMDC)  risk  categories  (favorable  versus  intermediate  versus  poor)  and 
geographic  region  (North  America  versus  Western  Europe  versus  “Rest  of  the  World”).  
Subjects  were  randomized  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  one  of  the  2  treatment  arms  in  the  trial.    Study 
treatments are continued until progressive disease (PD) is BICR-verified or further confirmed 
by the investigator, unacceptable adverse events (AEs) or intercurrent illness prevents further 
administration  of  treatment,  death  or  withdrawal  of  consent.    Following  verification  or 
confirmation of PD, all  subjects are followed for survival (by phone contact or clinic visit) 
until  death,  withdrawal  of  consent,  loss  to  follow-up,  or  until  the  study  is  concluded  or 
terminated early, whichever comes first.
KEYNOTE-581 (KN581) is a Phase III randomized, open-label study to evaluate efficacy and 
safety  of  pembrolizumab  plus  lenvatinib  and  lenvatinib  plus  everolimus  versus  sunitinib 
monotherapy  as  a  first-line  treatment  for  advanced  or  mRCC.  Eligible  participants  were 
stratified  by  the  Memorial  Sloan-Kettering  Cancer  Center  (MSKCC)  risk  score  (favorable, 
intermediate  versus  poor  risk  groups)  and  geographic  region  (North  America  and  Western 
Europe versus Other). Participants were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the 3 treatment 
arms in the trial. Study treatments are continued until confirmed PD by independent review, 
development  of  unacceptable  toxicity,  participant  request,  withdrawal  of  consent  or  study 
termination by the sponsor. Participants will then enter the follow-up period. The follow up 
period begins the day after the Off-Treatment Visit and continues as long as the participants is 
alive, unless the participant withdraws consent, is lost to follow-up, or the sponsor terminates 
the study.
KEYNOTE-564  (KN564)  is  a  Phase  III,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled, 
multicenter, global study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in participants 
with RCC completely resected by nephrectomy and/or metastasectomy with intermediate-high 
or high risk of recurrence. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
pembrolizumab  or  placebo  as  adjuvant  therapy  following  nephrectomy/metastasectomy. 
Randomization was stratified by metastatic status by investigator review (M0 versus M1 no 
evidence  of  disease  [NED]).  Within  the  M0  group,  randomization  was  further  stratified  by 
ECOG performance status (0 versus 1) and geographic location (United States versus outside 
of the United States). The study treatment was administered for up to approximately 1 year, or 
until  disease  recurrence,  unacceptable  toxicity,  intercurrent  illness  preventing  further 
administration  of  study  treatment,  investigator’s  decision,  protocol  noncompliance,  or 
administrative reasons requiring discontinuation of study treatment. Participants will then enter 
the  follow-up  period. After  the  end  of  treatment,  participants  will  be  followed  for  the 
occurrence of AEs. Participants who discontinue for reasons other than disease recurrence will 
have  posttreatment  imaging  follow-up  for  disease  status  until  confirmation  of  disease 
 
 
recurrence,  initiating a  new  anticancer treatment, withdrawing  consent,  or  becoming lost  to 
follow-up. All participants will be followed for OS until death, withdrawal of consent, or the 
end of the study.

accepted  SOC  therapies  for  CRC  in  participants  with  locally  confirmed  dMMR  or  MSI-H 
unresectable or metastatic CRC who have not received prior chemotherapy for unresectable or 
metastatic CRC. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive pembrolizumab (200 mg Q3W) 
or investigator’s choice of SOC therapies for CRC (mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI with or without 
combination  with  bevacizumab  or  cetuximab).  Treatment  with  pembrolizumab  was 
administered  until  documented  disease  progression,  patient  has  received  35  trial  treatments 
(for pembrolizumab), unacceptable toxicity, or other protocol defined stopping criteria. Those 
subjects  that  received  investigator’s  choice  chemotherapy  and  have  centrally  verified 
progression can crossover and receive pembrolizumab therapy for up to 35 cycles.

first-line 
locally  advanced  unresectable  or  metastatic 
adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus or advanced/metastatic Siewert 
type 1 adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction (GEJ). Subjects were randomized 1:1 
to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenous (IV) or saline placebo once every three weeks 
or chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil 800 mg/m2 IV on days 1-5 plus cisplatin 80 mg/m2 IV [for a 
maximum  of  6  cycles])  every  3  weeks.  Randomization  was  stratified  by  geographic  region 
(Asia vs non-Asia), histology (esophageal squamous cell carcinoma versus adenocarcinoma), 
and  ECOG  performance  status  (0  vs  1).    Treatment  was  continued  until  confirmed  disease 
progression, completion of 24 months of treatment, or other protocol defined stopping criteria. 
KEYNOTE-355  (KN355)  is  a  randomized,  double-blind,  multi-center,  placebo-controlled, 
Phase  III  study  evaluating  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  pembrolizumab  in  combination  with 
chemotherapy (paclitaxel, or nab-paclitaxel, or gemcitabine and carboplatin) in subjects with 
locally recurrent unresectable or metastatic TNBC, regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression, and 
not previously treated with chemotherapy. Subjects were randomized (2:1) to one of the two 
treatment  arms  (pembrolizumab  +  chemotherapy  or  placebo  +  chemotherapy)  stratified  by 
chemotherapy treatment (taxane vs. gemcitabine/carboplatin), tumor PD-L1 expression (CPS 
≥1 vs. CPS<1), and prior treatment with the same class of chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant 
setting  (yes  vs.  no).  Treatment  with  pembrolizumab  or  placebo  was  administered  until 
confirmed  disease  progression,  unacceptable  toxicity,  or  a  maximum  of  24  months. 
Administration with pembrolizumab was permitted beyond disease progression if the subject
was clinically stable and considered to be deriving clinical benefit.  
KEYNOTE-522  (KN522)  is  a  randomized,  double-blind,  multi-center,  placebo-controlled, 
Phase  III  study  evaluating  pembrolizumab  plus  chemotherapy  (paclitaxel  and  carboplatin 
followed  by  doxorubicin,  or  epirubicin,  and  cyclophosphamide)  versus placebo  plus 
chemotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy and pembrolizumab versus placebo as adjuvant therapy 
in patients with previously untreated locally advanced TNBC. Subjects were randomized (2:1) 
 
 
to  one  of  the  two  treatment  arms  (pembrolizumab  +  chemotherapy  or  placebo  + 
chemotherapy), and  stratified by  nodal  status  (positive  vs.  negative), tumor  size  (T1/T2  vs. 
T3/T4)  and  choice  of  carboplatin  (Q3W  vs.  weekly).  Treatment  was  continued  until 
completion of study treatment (17 cycles of pembrolizumab/placebo), disease progression in 
the neoadjuvant phase or recurrence (local or distance) after surgery, or other protocol defined 
stopping criteria.
KEYNOTE-146 (KN146) is a multi-center, multi-cohort, open-label, Phase Ib/II trial of the 
combination of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab in patients with advanced/metastatic NSCLC, 
RCC,  endometrial  carcinoma,  urothelial  carcinoma,  HNSCC,  or  melanoma.  In  KN146, 
lenvatinib dose is 20 mg orally once daily (the maximum tolerated dose/recommended phase 
II  dose)  in  combination  with  pembrolizumab  200  mg  administered  intravenously  every  3 
weeks.  Patients received study treatment until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression as 
determined  by  the  investigators.  Administration  of  lenvatinib  and  pembrolizumab  was 
permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and 
considered  to  be  deriving  clinical  benefit  by  the  investigator.  Pembrolizumab  dosing  was 
continued  up  to  35  treatments  (approximately  2  years);  however,  treatment  with  lenvatinib 
could be continued beyond 2 years. The primary safety data from KN146 includes all patients 
with histologically confirmed endometrial carcinoma from Study KN146 who received at least 
1  dose  of  lenvatinib  20  mg/day  with  pembrolizumab  200  mg  Q3W  as  starting  dose,  who 
received 1 or more prior systemic anticancer therapy(ies), who have a median follow-up time 
of at least 12 months and minimum 6 months follow-up after objective response assessment 
per  investigator  (ie,  enrolled  prior  to  01-JUL-2018),  and  whose  tumors  are  not  MSI-H  or 
dMMR.
KEYNOTE-775 (KN775) is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, Phase 3 study to compare 
the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab versus treatment of 
physician’s choice (TPC) in participants with advanced endometrial carcinoma who have been 
treated with at least one prior platinum-based chemotherapy regimen. In KN775, participants 
were randomized to one of two treatment arms - Arm A, lenvatinib 20 mg orally once daily 
plus pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks. Arm B, TPC consisting of either 
doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 by IV bolus injection, 1-hour infusion, or per institutional guidelines 
every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 by 1-hour IV infusion or per institutional guidelines 
given  weekly,  3  weeks  on/1  week  off.  Crossover  between  treatment  arms  is  not  permitted. 
Prior to randomization, investigators selected and recorded the TPC option in the event the 
participant  was  assigned  to  that  arm.  Randomization  followed  a  predefined  randomization 
scheme based on specific stratification factors. Each eligible participant is assigned to receive 
study  treatment  until  disease  progression  is  radiographically  documented  and  verified  by 
blinded independent central review (BICR) per RECIST 1.1, unacceptable adverse event(s), 
withdrawal  of  consent,  until  the  participant  has  received  a  maximum  35  administrations  of 
pembrolizumab (approximately 2 years), or the participant has received a lifetime cumulative 
dose of 500 mg/m² of doxorubicin. Participants who stop study treatment after receiving 35 
administrations of pembrolizumab for reasons other than disease progression or intolerability, 
or participants who attain a complete response (CR) and stop study treatment may be eligible 
for up to 1 year of treatment with pembrolizumab (17 cycles) ± lenvatinib upon experiencing 
disease  progression  (Second  Course  Phase).  Participants  who  complete  treatment  with 
pembrolizumab after 35 cycles or CR will continue to receive lenvatinib alone until disease 
 
 
progression is  confirmed by BICR, development of unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of 
consent. Participants are permitted to continue study treatment beyond RECIST 1.1-defined 
disease progression per investigator’s assessment as long as the maximum dose of the study 
drugs  have  not  been  reached,  if  the  treating  investigator  considers  that  the  participant  may 
experience  clinical  benefit  with  continued  treatment,  and  the  participant  is  tolerating  study 
treatment.
KEYNOTE-158 (KN158) is a multicenter, global, open-label Phase II study of pembrolizumab 
monotherapy in multiple types of advanced (unresectable and/or metastatic) rare cancer. All 
patients  enrolled  in  this  study  must  have  a  histologically  or  cytologicallydocumented, 
advanced  solid  tumor  that  is  incurable  and  for  which  prior  standard  first-line  treatment has 
failed. Patients must have progressed on or be intolerant to therapies that are known to provide 
clinical  benefit.  Treatment  with  pembrolizumab  is  administered  until  documented  disease 
progression,  patient  has  received 35  trial  treatments  (for  pembrolizumab),  unacceptable 
toxicity,  or  other  protocol  defined  stopping  criteria.  This  multi-histology  clinical  study  has 
been designed to enroll a “basket” of rare tumor types. Patients with any of the following solid 
tumor types have been enrolled: 
(A) Anal squamous cell carcinoma,

KEYNOTE-164  (KN164)  is  a  single-arm,  multisite,  two  cohort,  Phase  II  study  of 
pembrolizumab that was designed to evaluate the efficacy of pembrolizumab in patients with 
locally advanced unresectable or metastatic (Stage IV) MSI-H/dMMR CRC. Treatment with 
 
 
pembrolizumab is administered until documented disease progression, patient has received 35 
trial treatments (for pembrolizumab), unacceptable toxicity, or other protocol defined stopping 
criteria. Patients who met eligibility criteria have been enrolled in the following 2 cohorts: 
 Cohort  A:  Participants  with  locally  advanced  unresectable  or  metastatic  dMMR  or 
MSI-H CRC who had been previously treated with at least 2 lines of standard of care 
therapies, which must have included fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. 
 Cohort  B:  Participants  with  locally  advanced  unresectable  or  metastatic  dMMR  or 
MSI-H CRC who had been previously treated with at least 1 line of systemic standard 
of  care  therapy  (fluoropyrimidine  +  oxaliplatin  or  fluoropyrimidine  +  irinotecan  ± 
antivascular endothelial growth factor [anti-VEGF]/ epidermal growth factor receptor 
[EGF] monoclonal antibody [mAb]).
KEYNOTE-826 (KN826) is a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 
pembrolizumab  plus  chemotherapy  versus  chemotherapy  alone  in  women  with  persistent, 
recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer who are not eligible for treatment with curative intent 
(such as with surgery and/or radiation) and who have not previously been treated with systemic 
chemotherapy, with the exception of chemotherapy used as a radio sensitizing agent. Patients
were  randomized  1:1  to  receive  pembrolizumab  with  carboplatin/cisplatin  +  paclitaxel  or 
placebo  with  carboplatin/cisplatin  +  paclitaxel.  Bevacizumab  was  also  permitted  by 
investigator  choice.  Participants  received  study  treatments  until  disease  progression, 
unacceptable AEs, or other protocol defined stopping criteria.
KEYNOTE-811  (KN811)  is  a  global,  randomized,  double-blind,  Phase  III  study  of 
pembrolizumab or placebo in combination with trastuzumab and the investigator’s choice of 
chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin or capecitabine and oxaliplatin in participants 
with  previously  untreated  unresectable  or  metastatic,  HER2-positive  gastric  or 
gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. Patients may remain on treatment for 24 months, 
until  disease  progression  or  another  protocol-specified  reason  for  discontinuation  from 
therapy. Patients who complete 35 administrations of pembrolizumab/placebo have the option
to receive up to 1 additional year of trastuzumab +capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or S-
1 (tegafur, gimeracil, oteracil) at the discretion of the investigator. After discontinuation from 
treatment, patients are followed for survival.
KEYNOTE-859  (KN859)  is  a  global,  randomized,  double-blind,  Phase  III  study  of 
pembrolizumab or placebo in combination with the investigator’s choice of chemotherapy with 
5-fluorouracil  and  cisplatin  or  capecitabine  and  oxaliplatin  in  participants  with previously 
untreated  unresectable  or  metastatic,  HER2-negative  gastric  or  gastro-oesophageal  junction 
adenocarcinoma.  Patients  were  stratified  by  geographical  region (Europe/Israel/North 
America/Australia, Asia or Rest of the World), PD-L1 tumor expression status (CPS<1, ≥1) 
and chemotherapy regimen (FP or CAPOX). Patients may remain on treatment for 24 months, 
until  disease  progression  or  another  protocol-specified  reason  for  discontinuation  from 
therapy.
KEYNOTE-966 (KN966) is a global, randomized, double-blinded, multi-site Phase 3 trial of 
pembrolizumab  plus  gemcitabine/cisplatin  versus  placebo  plus  gemcitabine/cisplatin  in 
 
 
patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic BTC who have not previously been 
treated with systemic chemotherapy, with the exception of adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy. 
Prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent or with an agent directed to 
another  stimulatory  or  coinhibitory  T-cell  receptor  (eg,  CTLA-4,  OX-40,  CD137)  was 
exclusionary.  The  trial  includes  patients  with  BTC  diagnosis  confirmed  by  histology,  or 
cytology  (small  cell  cancer,  neuroendocrine  tumors,  lymphoma,  sarcoma,  and/or  mucinous 
cystic neoplasms are not eligible). To be eligible, patients must have disease not amenable to 
a curative treatment approach. Patients must also have measurable disease based on RECIST 
1.1, as determined by the site investigator, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
performance score of 0 or 1 and predicted life expectancy of greater than 3 months. Patients 
are enrolled regardless of tissue PD-L1 biomarker status. Patients  are required to provide  a 
tumor  tissue  sample  for  biomarker  analysis.  Per  protocol  defined  criteria  patients  with 
controlled HBV infection on antiviral therapy, as well as patients with past or ongoing HCV 
infection  were  eligible  for  the  trial.  Participants  received  study  treatments  until  disease 
progression, unacceptable AEs, or other protocol defined stopping criteria.

Pneumonitis is a known risk 
and is included as an 
important identified risk for 
pembrolizumab. Patients 
with a history of
pneumonitis may 
experience pneumonitis 
during treatment.  However, 
given the life- threatening
nature of the indication and
the ability to reverse 
pneumonitis should it occur
during treatment with 
pembrolizumab, these 
patients should still have the
option of treatment.
Exclusion is specific to 
requirements of clinical trial 
participation rather than real 
world use.
Exclusion is specific to 
understanding of efficacy 
and safety in clinical trial 
environment rather than real

Adequately reflected in the 
SmPC (section 4.6)
Patients with treated brain 
metastases were shown to 
have similar safety and 
activity of pembrolizumab. 
Given the fatal nature of 
their cancer, physicians 
should be allowed to use 
discretion on the 
management of brain
metastases with systemic 
and local treatment options.

Experience to date 
demonstrates that 
pembrolizumab is well 
tolerated for oncology 
patients. Substantial 
documented benefits of 
treatment in life 
threatening, or 
otherwise lethal 
disease may outweigh 
risks.  
This will not be applicable 
in the post-marketing 
environment as the 
appropriate population will 
be defined in the SmPC.
Physicians should be 
allowed to determine 
which tumor posess the 
greatest risk and is the 
highest priority for 
treatment.

Limitations to Detect Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trial Development 
Program
The clinical development programme is unlikely to detect certain types of adverse reactions 
such  as  rare  adverse  reactions,  adverse  reactions  with  a  long  latency,  or  those  caused  by 
prolonged or cumulative exposure.
SIV.3
Limitations in Respect to Populations Typically Under-represented in Clinical 
Trial Development Program
Those  populations  detailed  in Section  SIV  will  require  additional  investigation  during  the 
development of  pembrolizumab.  Areas  of  missing  information  remain  and  will  be  assessed 
through  the  clinical  development  program  and  post  marketing  safety  surveillance.  The 
European Medicines Agency (EMA) Decision for the first paediatric investigation plan (PIP) 
covering  the  condition  ‘Treatment  of  all  conditions  included  in  the  category  of  malignant 
neoplasms (except nervous system, haematopoietic and lymphoid tissue)’ has been adopted on 
March  7,  2014.  The  first  PIP  was  subsequently  modified  and  the  EMA  decision  for  the 
modifications was  adopted  on  February  16,  2018.  The  EMA  Decision  for  the  second  PIP 
covering the  condition  ‘Treatment  of  Hodgkin  Lymphoma’  has  been  adopted  on  August  1, 
2016. The second PIP was subsequently modified and the EMA decision for the modification 
was  adopted  on  January  30,  2018,  and  December  6,  2021,  respectively.  The  marketing 
authorization holder (MAH) will follow the PIP plans that have been adopted.
The  first  clinical  study  in  paediatric  patients,  KEYNOTE-051,  began  enrollment  in  March 
2015 and a clinical study report was prepared and submitted to the Agency in February 2019, 
resulting in adoption of an opinion for a PI update on June 27, 2019.
With  RMP  version  30.0, an  updated  clinical  study  report  for  KEYNOTE-051,  with  an 
additional  16  months  of  follow-up,  was  included  to  support  the  indication  in  relapsed  or 
refractory classical HL in the paediatric population.

Pregnant and breastfeeding women were not included in the pre-
authorisation clinical development program.
There have been no trials evaluating pembrolizumab in pregnant 
or lactating women. In clinical trials, women of childbearing 
potential have been advised to avoid pregnancy and to use 
effective contraception during the dosing period and for a period 
of at least 120 days thereafter. A pregnancy test was conducted on 
each pre-menopausal female of childbearing potential within 72 
hours prior to administration of pembrolizumab. If pregnancy was 
confirmed during the course of the trial, study drug administration 
was discontinued.  Any subject who became pregnant while in a 
study was followed to the completion/termination of the 
pregnancy. If the pregnancy continued to term, the outcome 
(health of infant) was to be reported to the MAH.
Patients with the following conditions were excluded from clinical 
trials: active CNS metastases; ECOG PS ≥ 2 (except for urothelial 
carcinoma and RCC); HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection; active
systemic autoimmune disease; interstitial lung disease; prior 
pneumonitis requiring systemic corticosteroid therapy; a history of 
severe hypersensitivity to another monoclonal antibody; receiving 
immunosuppressive therapy and a history of severe immune-related 
adverse reactions from treatment with ipilimumab, defined as any 
Grade 4 toxicity or Grade 3 toxicity requiring corticosteroid
treatment (> 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) for greater than 12
weeks. Patients with active infections were excluded from clinical 
trials and were required to have their infection treated prior to
receiving pembrolizumab. Patients with active infections occurring 
during treatment with pembrolizumab were managed with 
appropriate medical therapy. Patients with clinically significant renal 
(creatinine > 1.5 x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN)) or hepatic 
(bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) > 2.5 x ULN in the absence of liver 
metastases) abnormalities at baseline were excluded from clinical 
trials, therefore information is limited in patients with severe renal 
and moderate to severe hepatic impairment.
These exclusion criteria were applied to ensure that the population 
under study had adequate organ function in order to have a 
homogeneous patient population and to avoid potential confounding 
variables in the interpretation of safety data from the studies.

Method Used to Calculate Exposure
A summary of the worldwide distribution of pembrolizumab for the cumulative period from 
market introduction to 03-SEP-2022 is presented below based on the available data.
Patient exposure estimates were calculated from our Company’s internal distribution data from 
the  Worldwide  Financial  Reporting  System  (WFRS),  and  the  Financial  Sharing  Area 
databases. This data provides a more complete and consistent methodology for the estimate of 
patient exposure worldwide for current Company products. Patient exposure estimates were 
calculated from expanded distribution categories to provide a more accurate estimate of patient 
exposure worldwide. The effects of this update (starting 01-AUG-2018) may be apparent when 
comparing current estimates of patient exposure to those of prior reporting periods.
Pembrolizumab is available in 20 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg vials. The dosing recommendation 
in adults is either 200 mg every 3 weeks or 400 mg every 6 weeks. Since patient exposure for 
the  doses  of  200  mg  every  3  weeks  or  400  mg  every  6  weeks  are  essentially  equivalent, 
standard dosing of 200 mg every 3 weeks was used for patient exposure estimation.
 The total number of vials for 20 mg vial, 50 mg vial, and 100 mg vial was divided by the 
average number of vials required to formulate a standard dose of 200mg. Specifically, the 
number of units utilized when dosing with 20 mg vials was on average 10 units; 50 mg 
vials was on average 4 units; and 100 mg vials was on average 2 units. Therefore, the total 
number of vials for the 20 mg strength was divided by 10, the total number of vials for the 
50 mg strength was divided by 4, and the total number of vials for the 100 mg strength was 
divided by 2, to determine the number of doses (cycles).
 The estimated number of doses (cycles) per vial was then divided by the average number 
of  doses  estimated  per  patient  per  year  of  treatment  with  pembrolizumab.  The  average 
number of doses estimated per year of treatment with approximately 23 days between doses 
(recommended 21 days with 2-day allowance for weekends), or an average of 15.9 doses 
per patient regardless of strength (365 days/23 days).
SV.1.2
Exposure
The estimated number of doses of pembrolizumab distributed worldwide from product launch 
through 03-SEP-2022 is 27,431,679. This corresponds to 831,758 patient years of treatment.

SVII.3 Details of Important Identified Risks, Important Potential Risks, and Missing 
Information
SVII.3.1
Presentation of Important Identified Risks and Important Potential Risks
The characterization of the risk profile of pembrolizumab is presented based on four data sets 
(n=2799), the melanoma and NSCLC patient populations in KN001, the melanoma patient
population in KN002,
the melanoma patient population in KN006, and the previously
treated NSCLC patient population in KN010, and is considered as the reference safety
dataset for pembrolizumab. The reference safety dataset serves as the locked dataset for
the characterization of each risk associated with pembrolizumab and is presented in
tabular format.
Safety data related to the previously untreated NSCLC population in KN024 (database 
cutoff date 10-JUL-2017) and KN042 (database cutoff date 26-FEB-2018) (total n=790) was
evaluated and is presented in text for each risk. Overall, the safety profile from the NSCLC
population in KN024 and KN042 was generally similar to the observed safety profile from 
the reference safety dataset.
Safety data related to the NSCLC population in KN189 (database cutoff date 08-NOV-2017) 
and KN021 (Cohorts C and G) pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (database cutoff date 31-
MAY-2017) (total n=488) were evaluated and are presented in text for each risk. Overall, the 
safety  profile  from  the  NSCLC  population  in  KN189  and  KN021  (Cohorts  C  and  G) 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy was generally similar to the observed safety profile from 
the reference safety dataset. 
 
 
Safety data related to the Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) populations in KN013 (database cutoff
date 28-SEP-2018), KN087 (database cutoff date 21-MAR-2019),  and  KN204  (database 
cutoff date 16-JAN-2020) (total n=389) were evaluated and are presented in text for each
risk. Overall, the safety profile from the HL population was generally similar to the observed 
safety  profile  in  the  reference  safety dataset,  with  the  exception  of  a  higher  incidence  of 
pneumonitis (8% versus 3.4%) and hypothyroidism (17% versus 8.5%). The higher incidence 
of  pneumonitis  was  likely  reflective  of  high  rates  of  prior  exposure  to  radiation  and/or 
chemotherapy;  agents  with  a  known  association  of  pulmonary  toxicity.  The  majority  of 
pneumonitis events were Grade 3 and below and resolved with systemic corticosteroids. There 
were no fatal events of pneumonitis. All reported events of hypothyroidism were Grade 1 and 
2 and resolved with standard therapeutic measures. The observed incidence of hypothyroidism 
was considered attributable to a prior history of regional radiation and to a higher rate of pre-
existing hypothyroidism among participants in this group at baseline.
Safety data related to the urothelial carcinoma (UC) indication in KN052 (database cutoff
date 01-SEP-2016) (n=370) and KN045 (database cutoff date 07-SEP-2016) (n=266) were
evaluated and are presented in text for each risk. Overall, the safety profile from the UC
population in KN052 and in KN045 was generally similar to the observed safety profile in
the reference safety dataset.
Safety data related to the HNSCC population in KN040 (database cutoff date 15-MAY-2017), 
KN012 (database cutoff date 26-APR-2016), and KN055 (database cutoff date 22-APR-2016) 
(total n=609) were evaluated and are presented in text for each risk. Overall, the safety profile 
from the HNSCC population was generally similar to the reference safety dataset.
Safety data related to the HNSCC population in KN048 (database cutoff date13-JUN-2018) 
(pembrolizumab  monotherapy  n=300;  pembrolizumab  plus  chemotherapy  n=276)  were 
evaluated and are presented in text for each risk. Overall, the safety profile of pembrolizumab 
monotherapy from the HNSCC population in KN048 was generally similar to the reference 
safety dataset. The AE profile observed in pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy was generally 
similar to the known safety profiles of either pembrolizumab monotherapy or platinum/5-FU 
chemotherapy.
Safety data related to the melanoma indication in KN054 (database cutoff date 02-OCT-2017) 
(n= 509) was evaluated and is presented in text for each risk. Overall, the safety profile from 
the melanoma population in KN054 was generally similar to the observed safety profile from 
the reference safety dataset. Higher frequencies of some immune-mediated AEs, mostly mild 
to moderate in severity and manageable with treatment interruption or discontinuation and/or 
corticosteroid therapy were observed in KN054 in comparison to the reference safety dataset.  
This could be a reflection of the >2-fold longer exposure to pembrolizumab in KN054 subjects 
compared to subjects in the reference safety dataset.  
Safety data related to the NSCLC population in KN021 Cohort A (database cutoff date 07-
NOV-2016) and KN407 (database cutoff 03-APR-2018) (total n=303) were evaluated and are 
presented in text for each risk. Overall, the risk profile from the NSCLC population observed 
in the pooled KN407 and KN021 Cohort A combo was generally similar to the risk profile for 
pembrolizumab as characterized in the reference safety dataset, and the AE summary profile 
 
 
observed  was  generally  similar  to  the  known  safety  profiles  of  either  pembrolizumab 
monotherapy or carboplatin/paclitaxel (or nab-paclitaxel) chemotherapy.  
Safety data related to the RCC population in KN426 who received pembrolizumab plus axitinib 
(database cutoff date 24-AUG-2018), were evaluated and are presented in text for each risk. 
The AE profile observed in pembrolizumab plus axitinib was generally similar to the known 
safety profiles of the  combined safety profiles of pembrolizumab monotherapy  (both in the 
reference  safety  dataset  and  in  1L  RCC)  and  axitinib  monotherapy  in  1L  RCC,  with  the 
exception of a higher than expected incidence of Grade 3-4 transaminase elevations. In KN426, 
Grades  3  and  4  ALT  increased  (20%)  and  AST  increased  (13%)  were  observed  in  the 
pembrolizumab plus axitinib group. The median time to onset of ALT ≥3 times ULN was 2.3 
months  (range:  7  days  to  19.8  months).  In  patients  with  ALT  ≥3  times  ULN  (Grade  2-4, 
n=116), ALT resolved to Grade 0-1 in 94%. Sixty-one percent of the patients with increased 
ALT  received  systemic  corticosteroids.  Of  the  patients  who  recovered,  92  (84%)  were 
rechallenged  with  either  pembrolizumab  (3%)  or  axitinib  (31%)  monotherapy  or  with  both 
(50%). Of these patients, 55% had no recurrence of ALT >3 times ULN, and of those patients 
with recurrence of ALT >3 times ULN, all recovered. There were no Grade 5 hepatic events.
Safety data related to the CRC population in KN177 (database cutoff 19-FEB-2020) (n=153) 
were  evaluated  and  are  presented  in  text  for  each  risk.  Overall,  the  safety  profile  of 
pembrolizumab monotherapy in the CRC population in KN177 was generally similar to the 
observed safety profile in the reference safety dataset.  
Safety data related to the esophageal cancer population in KN590 (database cutoff 02-JUL-
2020) who received pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (total n=370) were evaluated and are 
presented in text for each risk. The AE profile observed in pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy 
group was generally similar to the known safety profiles of either pembrolizumab monotherapy 
or platinum/5-FU chemotherapy. 
Safety data related to the TNBC population in KN355 (database cutoff 11-DEC-2019) who 
received pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (total n=596) were evaluated and are presented in 
text for each risk. Overall, the observed safety profile of pembrolizumab in combination with 
chemotherapy in TNBC was generally similar to the known safety profiles of pembrolizumab 
monotherapy and the chemotherapy administered.
Safety  data  related  to  the  RCC  population  in  KN581  who  received  pembrolizumab  plus 
lenvatinib (database cutoff 28-AUG-2020) (n=352) were evaluated and are presented in text 
for  each  risk.  Overall,  the  safety  profile  observed  in  pembrolizumab  in  combination  with 
lenvatinib in the RCC population in KN581 was generally similar to the known safety profiles 
of pembrolizumab monotherapy (reference safety dataset) and lenvatinib monotherapy, except 
for  a  higher  incidence of  immune-mediated  AEs  primarily  due  to  hypothyroidism  (47.2%), 
mostly  grade  1  and  2  events.  Smaller  increases  in  some  immune- mediated  AEs  were  also 
observed.  The  nature  (severity,  management,  and  outcome)  of  the  immune-mediated  AEs 
observed  with  the  pembrolizumab  and  lenvatinib  combination  was  similar  to  the  nature  of 
immune-mediated AEs previously seen with pembrolizumab monotherapy.
 
 
Safety data related to the endometrial carcinoma population in KN146 (database cutoff 18-
AUG-2020)  and  KN775  (database  cutoff  26-OCT-2020)  (total  n=530)  who  received 
pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib, were evaluated and are presented in text for each risk. Overall, 
the safety profile observed in pembrolizumab in combination with lenvatinib in endometrial 
carcinoma was generally similar to the known safety profiles of pembrolizumab monotherapy 
(reference  safety  dataset)  and  lenvatinib  monotherapy,  except  for  a  higher  incidence  of 
hypothyroidism  (55.8%),  mostly  due  to  grade  1  and  2  events.  Smaller  increases  in  some 
immune-mediated AEs were observed, including colitis (4.9%) and hyperthyroidism (10.2%). 
The nature (severity, management, and outcome) of the immune-mediated AEs observed with 
the pembrolizumab and lenvatinib combination was similar to the nature of immune-mediated 
AEs previously seen with pembrolizumab monotherapy.
Safety data related to the RCC population in KN564 (database cutoff 14-DEC-2020) (n=488) 
were  evaluated  and  are  presented  in  text  for  each  risk.  Overall,  the  safety  profile  of 
pembrolizumab monotherapy in the RCC population in KN564 was generally similar to the 
observed safety profile in the reference safety dataset, except for a higher incidence of immune 
mediated events primarily due to hypothyroidism (21.1%) and hyperthyroidism (11.9%), due 
to  grade  1  and  2  events.  The  nature  (severity,  management,  and  outcome)  of  the  immune-
mediated  AEs  was  similar  to  the  nature  of  immune-mediated  AEs  previously  seen  with 
pembrolizumab monotherapy.  
Safety data related to the MSI-H population in KN158 Cohort K (database cutoff 05-OCT-
2020) and KN164 Cohorts A and B (database cutoff 09-SEP-2019) (n=475) were evaluated 
and  are  presented  in  text  for  each  risk.  Overall,  the  safety  profile  of  pembrolizumab 
monotherapy in the MSI-H population in KN158 Cohort K and KN164 Cohorts A and B was 
generally similar to the observed safety profile in the reference safety dataset.
Safety data related to the cervical cancer population in KN826 (database cutoff 03-MAY-2021) 
who received pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy ± bevacizumab (total n=307) were evaluated 
and are presented in text for each risk. Overall, the observed safety profile of pembrolizumab 
in combination with chemotherapy ± bevacizumab in cervical cancer was generally similar to 
the  known  safety  profiles  of  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  and  bevacizumab  or  the 
chemotherapy administered. The overall exposure-adjusted incidence of AEOSIs was higher 
in  the  pembrolizumab  +  chemotherapy  ±  bevacizumab  group  compared  with  the 
pembrolizumab  monotherapy  reference  safety  dataset.  Most  AEOSIs  reported  in  the 
pembrolizumab  +  chemotherapy  ±  bevacizumab  group  were  mild  to  moderate  in  severity 
(Grade 1 or 2). The higher incidence of exposure-adjusted AEOSIs in the pembrolizumab + 
chemotherapy  ±  bevacizumab  group  was  driven  primarily  by  infusion  reactions  (13.4%), 
reflecting the contribution of pembrolizumab, chemotherapy and bevacizumab.
Safety  data  related  to  the  TNBC  population  in  KN522  (database  cutoff  23-MAR-2021) 
(n=783) were evaluated and are presented in text for each risk. Overall, the safety profile of 
pembrolizumab  in  combination  with  neoadjuvant  chemotherapy  followed  by  continued 
adjuvant pembrolizumab monotherapy in TNBC in KN522 was generally similar to the known 
safety profiles of pembrolizumab monotherapy and the chemotherapy administered. A higher 
frequency  of  immune-mediated events  was  observed  in  the  pembrolizumab  in  combination 
with  neoadjuvant  chemotherapy  group  followed  by  continued  adjuvant  pembrolizumab 
 
 
monotherapy treatment group in comparison to the reference safety dataset. This was primarily 
driven by hypothyroidism (15.1%), infusion reactions (18%), and severe skin reactions (5.7%), 
reflecting  the  contribution  of  both  pembrolizumab  and  the  neoadjuvant  chemotherapy 
administered. Most AEOSIs were grade 1 and 2. The nature (type, severity, management, and 
outcome) of  the  immune-mediated  AEs  observed  with  pembrolizumab in combination with 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by continued adjuvant pembrolizumab monotherapy in 
KN522  was  similar  to  the  nature  of  immune-mediated  AEs  previously  seen  with 
pembrolizumab monotherapy.
Safety  data  related  to  the  melanoma population  in  KN716  (database  cutoff  04-DEC-2020) 
(total n=483) were evaluated and are presented in text for each risk. Overall, the safety profile 
of pembrolizumab monotherapy in the melanoma population in KN716 was generally similar 
to  the  observed  safety  profile  in  the  reference  safety  dataset.  Increases  in  some  immune-
mediated AEs were observed. The nature (type, severity, management, and outcome) of the 
immune-mediated AEs observed with pembrolizumab in KN716 was similar to the nature of 
immune-mediated AEs previously seen with pembrolizumab monotherapy. The increases in 
some immune-mediated AEs observed in KN716 could be a reflection of the >2-fold longer 
duration  of  exposure  to  pembrolizumab  in  KN716  subjects  compared  to  subjects  in  the 
reference safety dataset.  
Safety data related to the gastric cancer population in KN811 (database cutoff 25-MAY-2022) 
who received pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy and trastuzumab (n=350) were evaluated and 
are presented in text for each risk. Overall, the safety profile of pembrolizumab combination 
therapy in the gastric cancer population in KN811 was generally similar to the observed safety 
profile  in  the  reference  safety  dataset,  except  for  a  higher  incidence  of  immune-mediated 
events primarily due to infusion-related reactions (16.0%) and pneumonitis (6.0%). The higher 
incidence of these events may be driven by the  addition of trastuzumab and chemotherapy,
since these are known risks for the SOC regimen.  The longer duration of exposure compared 
to the reference safety dataset may also have contributed to the observed higher incidence of 
these AEOSIs.    The  nature (severity,  management, and  outcome) of  the immune- mediated 
AEs was similar to the nature of immune-mediated AEs previously seen with pembrolizumab 
monotherapy.
Safety data related to the NSCLC population in KN091 (database cutoff date 20-Sep-2021) 
(total n=580 in pembrolizumab group) were evaluated and are presented in text for each risk. 
Overall,  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  pembrolizumab  administered  in  KN091  is  generally 
consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  of  pembrolizumab  in  the  advanced  cancer  setting, 
except for a higher incidence of immune-mediated events primarily due to a higher cumulative 
frequency  of  hypothyroidism  (20.7%)  and  hyperthyroidism  (10.7%),  due  to  grade  1  and  2 
events.  However,  the  incidences  of  hyperthyroidism  and  hypothyroidism  in  the  KN091 
pembrolizumab  group  are  consistent  with  those  reported  in  other  adjuvant  studies  with 
pembrolizumab  monotherapy  in  melanoma  (KN716)  and  RCC  (KN564)  populations.  The 
incidence  of  pneumonitis  (6.9%)  in  pembrolizumab  group  was  higher  than  in  the 
pembrolizumab reference safety dataset but, consistent with the incidence of pneumonitis (3.8 
to 8.3%) reported in individual studies of patients with NSCLC treated with pembrolizumab 
monotherapy. The increases in some immune-mediated AEs in KN091 could be a reflection of 
the  >2-fold  longer  duration  of  exposure  to  pembrolizumab  compared  to  subjects  in the 
 
 
reference  safety  dataset.  The  nature  (severity,  management,  and  outcome)  of  the  immune-
mediated  AEs  was  similar  to  the  nature  of  immune-mediated  AEs  previously  seen  with 
pembrolizumab monotherapy.
Safety data related to the gastric cancer population in KN859 (database cutoff 03-OCT-2022) 
who received pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (n=785) were evaluated and are presented in 
text  for  each  risk.  Overall,  the  safety  profile  of  pembrolizumab  combination  therapy  in  the 
gastric cancer population in KN859 was generally similar to the observed safety profiles of 
pembrolizumab  monotherapy  and  the  chemotherapy  administered,  except  for  a  higher 
incidence  of  immune-mediated  event  of  hypothyroidism  (15.3%)  as  compared  to  the  RSD.
After  adjustment for  exposure  the  event  rates  for  hypothyroidism  were  similar  to  the  RSD. 
The events of hypothyroidism in KN859, were mostly Grade 1 and 2 events and are generally 
consistent in nature with the events of hypothyroidism previously reported for pembrolizumab.
Safety data related to the BTC population in KN966 (database cutoff date: 15-Dec-2022) (total 
n=529) were evaluated and presented in text for each risk. Overall, safety and tolerability of 
pembrolizumab  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  in  the  BTC  population  in  KN966  was 
generally similar to the known safety profile of pembrolizumab monotherapy and the safety 
profile  of  chemotherapy.  The  AEOSI  severity  in  most  participants were  Grade  1  or  2.  The 
nature (type, severity, management, and outcome) of the immune-related AEs observed with 
pembrolizumab  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  was  similar  to  the  nature  of  immune-
related  AEs  previously  observed with  pembrolizumab  monotherapy in  the  reference  safety 
dataset.
All identified and potential risks for pembrolizumab are reviewed  routinely for a change in 
characterization (including severity, frequency and risk factors) in accordance with the EMA 
Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP) Module V Risk management systems 
and  Module  IX  Signal  Management.  Per  this  process,  data  regarding  reports  of  immune-
mediated  AEOSIs  with  a  fatal  outcome  were  reviewed.  Review  of  the  data  revealed  that  a 
number of AEOSIs had at least 1 event with a reported fatal outcome.
A series of database queries was done to identify all CT and postmarketing AEOSIs with a 
fatal outcome.
Clinical Trial (CT) Data:
The  Aggregate  Safety  Evaluation  (ASE)  dataset,  which  is  a  locked  aggregate  CT  safety 
database, was queried. The current 3Q2017 dataset contains all safety data for subjects who 
received pembrolizumab monotherapy in an open-label or unmasked, completed randomized 
trial for which there has been a database lock (DBL) on or before 30-Sep-2017 (n=7730).  The 
ASE was queried to identify any CT AEOSI with a reported Common Technology Criteria for
Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 5 (fatal outcome) severity. 
Global Safety Database and Postmarketing (PM) Data:
The  global  safety  database  contains  clinical  trial  (including  MAH  sponsored  clinical  trials, 
Investigator  Initiated  Study  Programs,  MAH  Sponsored Individual  Patient  Use,  Business 
Partner Cases, and Academic Collaboration Studies) information for all serious events as well 
 
 
as  other  reportable  events  such  as  cancer,  overdose,  pregnancy,  lactation,  and  protocol-
specified events of clinical interest.   The global safety database also contains all cases from 
postmarketing sources including health care providers, consumers and scientific literature as 
well as competent authorities worldwide. The safety database was queried as of 31-Dec-2017 
to identify all Grade 5 CT AEOSIs from interventional, pembrolizumab monotherapy trials.
The global safety database was also queried as of 31-Dec-2017, to identify all PM and non-
interventional reports containing a reported immune-mediated AEOSI with a fatal outcome. 
Two separate queries were done: one to identify reports with a fatal AEOSI only, excluding 
those  with  other  fatal  events  due  to  disease  progression/related  terms,  and  another  query 
including cases with other reported causes of death including those due to disease progression.
The results indicated that even with the broader global safety database analysis that included 
cases in which fatal AEOSIs were reported in the setting of disease progression, the number 
of cases with fatal immune-mediated AEOSIs remains low. 
While the frequency of fatal immune-mediated AEOSIs is low, and while there remain some 
immune-mediated AEOSIs for which there are no reports of fatal outcome, based on the totality 
of  data  and  medical  importance  of  the  information,  the  MAH  updated  the  Warning  and 
Precautions  section  of  the  prescribing  information  to  add  language  to  further  qualify  and 
communicate that immune-mediated AEOSIs may be fatal.
The immune-mediated adverse reactions are presumed to have a common aetiology. Of these
immune-mediated  adverse  reactions,  information  on severity  and  frequency  data  for 
pneumonitis,  colitis,  hepatitis,  nephritis  and  endocrinopathiesis  presented,  in  the  risk  tables 
below as part of the important identified risk.

Immune-mediated Pneumonitis
Pembrolizumab  is  a  potent  and  highly-selective  humanized  monoclonal  antibody  (mAb)  of  the 
Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)/kappa isotype directed to the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor 
and designed to directly block the interaction between the receptor and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-
L2. The PD-1 pathway represents a major immune control switch which may be engaged by tumor 
cells  to  overcome  active  T-cell  immune  surveillance. T-cell  activation  in  proximity  to  normal 
tissue may lead to inflammation and injury to normal lung tissue.
Review of pembrolizumab clinical trial data, post-marketing experience and literature regarding 
pneumonitis represent sufficient evidence of a causal association with pembrolizumab exposure.

data  from  ongoing  studies  and  postmarketing  data  regarding  immune-mediated  pneumonitis, 
including fatal cases, is consistent with the risk as characterized in the RMP
Patients with a history of non-infectious pneumonitis that required steroids or current pneumonitis
were excluded from the clinical trials.  These patients are considered to be a risk group for the 
development of pneumonitis; in the interim analysis of the KN001 NSCLC cohort, possible risk
factors identified that might predispose subjects to pneumonitis were a documented history of prior 
thoracic radiation to the chest (≥30Gy). According to the literature, risk factors for interstitial lung
disease  may  include  occupational  exposure  to  toxins,  chest  irradiation,  some  chemotherapies, 
smoking and advanced age.
Risk Factors and 
Risk Groups:
 
 
Table SVII.3.1.1:
Details of Important Identified Risk: Immune-Mediated Adverse 
Reactions-Pneumonitis
Preventability:
Although  the  development  of  pneumonitis  cannot  be  completely  prevented;  patients  should  be 
monitored  for  signs  and  symptoms  of pneumonitis. Suspected pneumonitis  should be  confirmed
with  radiographic 
imaging  and  other causes  excluded.  Withholding/discontinuation  of
pembrolizumab and appropriate medical intervention including corticosteroids following the onset
of pneumonitis may result in recovery.
Impact on the Risk-
Benefit Balance of 
the Product:
Severe pneumonitis may be life-threatening or fatal in individual patients.  However, given the fatal 
outcome  of  untreated  cancer,  the  risk  of  pneumonitis  which  generally  can  be  managed,  is 
outweighed by the potential benefit.
Public Health 
Impact:
This risk has minimal public health impact outside its effect on individual patients.  
Table SVII.3.1.2:
Details of Important Identified Risk: Immune-Mediated Adverse 
Reactions- Colitis
Important Identified 
Risk:  
Immune-mediated Colitis
Potential 
Mechanisms: 
Pembrolizumab  is  a  potent  and  highly-selective  humanized  monoclonal  antibody  (mAb)  of  the 
Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)/kappa isotype directed to the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor 
and designed to directly block the interaction between the receptor and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-
L2.  The PD-1 pathway represents a major immune control switch which may be engaged by tumor 
cells to overcome active T-cell immune surveillance. A potential mechanism of action is T-cell 
activation in proximity to normal tissue resulting in inflammation and injury to normal GI tissue.
Evidence Source(s) 
and Strength of 
Evidence:
Review of pembrolizumab clinical trial data, post-marketing experience and literature regarding 
colitis represent sufficient evidence of a causal association with pembrolizumab exposure.

The proportion  of  patients  with events  of  colitis  in  KN146  and  KN775,  although  higher  in 
frequency  than  in  the  reference  safety  dataset,  were  generally  consistent  in  nature  with  the 
proportion of events of colitis previously reported for pembrolizumab.
The  overall  number  and  proportion  of  patients  with  colitis  in  the  RCC  population  in  KN564 
pembrolizumab monotherapy (n=488) was 8 (1.6%) (95% CI-0.7,3.2), which is generally similar

Risk Factors and 
Risk Groups:
Preventability:
Impact on the Risk-
Benefit Balance of 
the Product:
Severe  colitis  may  be  life-threatening  or  fatal  in  individual  patients.  However,  given  the  fatal 
outcome of untreated cancer, the risk of colitis which generally can be managed, is outweighed by 
the potential benefit of pembrolizumab treatment.
Public Health 
Impact:
This risk has minimal public health impact outside its effect on individual patients.  
Table SVII.3.1.3:

Reactions- Hepatitis
Important Identified 
Risk:  
Potential 
Mechanisms: 
Immune-mediated Hepatitis
Pembrolizumab is  a  potent  and highly-selective humanized  monoclonal  antibody  (mAb) of  the 
Immunoglobulin  G4  (IgG4)/kappa  isotype  directed  to  the  programmed  cell  death-1  (PD-1) 
receptor and designed to directly block the interaction between the receptor and its ligands, PD-
L1  and  PD-L2.    The  PD-1  pathway  represents  a  major  immune  control  switch  which  may  be 
engaged by tumor cells to overcome active T-cell immune surveillance. A potential mechanism of 
action  is  T-cell  activation  in  proximity  to  normal  tissue  resulting  inflammation  and  injury  to 
normal liver tissue.
Evidence Source(s) 
and Strength of 
Evidence:
Review of pembrolizumab clinical trial data, post-marketing experience and literature regarding 
hepatitis represent sufficient evidence of a causal association with pembrolizumab exposure.

there were 4 Grade 5 clinical trial reports of hepatitis.  
Review  of  pembrolizumab  clinical  trial  data  from  ongoing  studies  and  postmarketing  data 
regarding  immune-mediated  hepatitis,  including  fatal  cases,  is  consistent  with  the  risk  as 
characterized in this RMP.
Patients with moderate to severe liver dysfunction were excluded from clinical trials. No analysis 
of  specific  risk  factors  for  immune-mediated hepatitis  associated with pembrolizumab has  been
undertaken.
Although  the  development  of  hepatitis  cannot  be  completely  prevented;  patients  should  be 
monitored  for  signs  and  symptoms  of  hepatitis  and  if  they  develop,  other  causes  excluded. 
Withholding/discontinuation  of  pembrolizumab and  appropriate  medical  intervention  including
corticosteroids following the onset of hepatitis may result in recovery.
Risk Factors and 
Risk Groups:
Preventability:
Impact on the Risk-
Benefit Balance of the 
Product:
Hepatic failure may be life-threatening or fatal in individual patients; however, the event can be 
managed with cessation of pembrolizumab and immunosuppression with corticosteroids. Given 
the fatal outcome of untreated cancer, the risk of immune-mediated hepatitis is outweighed by the 
potential benefit.

and Strength of 
Evidence:
Immune-mediated Nephritis
Pembrolizumab  is  a  potent  and  highly-selective  humanized  monoclonal  antibody  (mAb)  of  the 
Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)/kappa isotype directed to the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor 
and designed to directly block the interaction between the receptor and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-
L2. The PD-1 pathway represents a major immune control switch which may be engaged by tumor 
cells  to  overcome  active  T-cell  immune  surveillance. T-cell  activation  in  proximity  to  normal 
tissue may lead to inflammation and injury to normal tissue.
Review of pembrolizumab clinical trial data, post-marketing experience and literature regarding 
nephritis represent sufficient evidence of a causal association with pembrolizumab exposure.

Review  of  other  pembrolizumab  clinical  trial  data  from  ongoing  studies  regarding  immune-
mediated nephritis is consistent with the risk as characterized in this RMP.
Risk Factors and 
Risk Groups:
Patients with severe renal dysfunction were excluded from clinical trials. No specific risk factors 
for nephritis associated with pembrolizumab have been identified.
Preventability:
Although  the  development  of  nephritis  cannot  be  completely  prevented;  patients  should  be 
monitored  for  signs  and  symptoms  of  nephritis  and  if  they  develop,  other  causes  excluded. 
Withholding/discontinuation  of  pembrolizumab and  appropriate  medical  intervention  including
corticosteroids following the onset of nephritis may result in recovery.
Impact on the Risk-
Benefit Balance of 
the Product:
Nephritis can potentially lead to severe or life threatening renal injury.  Given the fatal outcome of 
untreated  cancer,  the  risk  of  nephritis  which  generally  can  be  managed  is  outweighed  by  the 
potential benefit.
Public Health 
Impact:
This risk has minimal public health impact outside its effect on individual patients.

Important Identified 
Risk:  
Potential 
Mechanisms: 
Immune-mediated Endocrinopathies- Hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism)  
Pembrolizumab  is  a  potent  and  highly-selective  humanized  monoclonal  antibody  (mAb)  of  the 
Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)/kappa isotype directed to the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor 
and designed to directly block the interaction between the receptor and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-
L2.  The PD-1 pathway represents a major immune control switch which may be engaged by tumor 
cells  to  overcome  active  T-cell  immune  surveillance.    T-cell  activation  in  proximity  to  normal 
tissue may lead to inflammation and injury to normal tissue.
Evidence Source(s) 
and Strength of 
Evidence:
Review of pembrolizumab clinical trial data, post-marketing experience and literature regarding 
endocrinopathies- hypophysitis represent sufficient evidence of a causal association with 
pembrolizumab exposure.

Risk Factors and 
Risk Groups:
No specific risk factors for hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism) associated with
pembrolizumab have been identified.
Preventability:
Although the development of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism) cannot be completely 
prevented; patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including
hypopituitarism) and if they develop, other causes excluded. Withholding/discontinuation of 
pembrolizumab and appropriate medical intervention including corticosteroids following the 
onset of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism) may result in recovery.
Impact on the Risk-
Benefit Balance of 
the Product:
Hypophysitis and hypopituitarism have the potential to become severe or life-threatening due to 
hormone deficiencies in individual patients. Given the fatal outcome of untreated cancer, the risk
of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism) is outweighed by the potential benefit.
Public Health 
Impact:
This risk has minimal public health impact outside its effect on individual patients.

Evidence Source(s) 
and Strength of 
Evidence:
Immune-mediated Endocrinopathies- Adrenal Insufficiency (primary and secondary)  
Pembrolizumab  is  a  potent  and  highly-selective  humanized  monoclonal  antibody  (mAb)  of  the 
Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)/kappa isotype directed to the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor 
and designed to directly block the interaction between the receptor and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-
L2.  The PD-1 pathway represents a major immune control switch which may be engaged by tumor 
cells  to  overcome  active  T-cell  immune  surveillance.    T-cell  activation  in  proximity  to  normal 
tissue may lead to inflammation and injury to normal tissue.
Review of pembrolizumab clinical trial data, post-marketing experience and literature regarding
endocrinopathies- Adrenal insufficiency (primary and secondary) represent sufficient evidence of 
a causal association with pembrolizumab exposure.

Preventability:
Although the development of adrenal insufficiency (primary and secondary) cannot be 
completely prevented; patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of adrenal 
insufficiency (primary and secondary) and if they develop, other causes excluded. 
Withholding/discontinuation of pembrolizumab and appropriate medical intervention including 
corticosteroids following the onset of adrenal insufficiency (primary and secondary) may result in 
recovery.
Impact on the Risk-
Benefit Balance of 
the Product:
Adrenal insufficiency (primary and secondary) has the potential to become severe or life-
threatening due to hormone deficiencies, in individual patients. Given the fatal outcome of 
untreated cancer, the risk of adrenal insufficiency (primary and secondary) is outweighed by the
potential benefit.

Evidence Source(s) 
and Strength of 
Evidence:
Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly-selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the 
Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)/kappa isotype directed to the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) 
receptor and designed to directly block the interaction between the receptor and its ligands, PD-
L1 and PD-L2.  The PD-1 pathway represents a major immune control switch which may be 
engaged by tumor cells to overcome active T-cell immune surveillance. The specific mechanism 
of thyroid disorders associated with pembrolizumab is unknown, but it is likely that immune 
mediated adverse events, including thyroid disorders, is due to immune mediated reaction to 
certain normal tissues.
Review of pembrolizumab clinical trial data, post-marketing experience and literature regarding 
endocrinopathies- thyroid disorder represent sufficient evidence of a causal association with 
pembrolizumab exposure.

The overall  number and proportion of patients with hypothyroidism in the NSCLC population in 
KN024 and KN042 (n=790) was 93 (11.8%) (95% CI-9.6, 14.2), the overall  number and proportion
 
 
Table SVII.3.1.7:
Details of Important Identified Risk:  Immune-Mediated 
Adverse Reactions- Endocrinopathies - Thyroid Disorder 
(Hypothyroidism, Hyperthyroidism, Thyroiditis)
of patients with hyperthyroidism was 50 (6.3%) (95% CI-4.7, 8.3); and the number and proportion 
of patients with thyroiditis was 14 (1.8%) (95% CI-1.0, 3.0), which are generally similar to the 
proportion of patients with the events of hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and thyroiditis in the 
reference safety dataset for melanoma and NSCLC. 
In  the  NSCLC  population  in  KN189  and  KN021  (Cohorts  C  and  G)  pembrolizumab  plus 
chemotherapy (n=488), the overall number and proportion of patients with  hypothyroidism was 
39  (8%)  (95%  CI- 5.7,  10.8);  of  hyperthyroidism  was  21  (4.3%)  (95%  CI- 2.7,  6.5);  and  of 
thyroiditis was 1 (0.2%) (95% CI- 0, 1.1), which was generally similar to the proportion of patients 
with the events of hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and thyroiditis in the reference safety dataset 
for melanoma and NSCLC.
The  overall  number  and  proportion  of  patients  with  hyperthyroidism  in  the  HL  population  in 
KN013, KN087, and KN204 (n=389) was 17 (4.4%) (95%CI-2.6, 6.9); and of thyroiditis was 5 
(1.3%) (95% CI-0.4, 3.0), which are generally similar to the proportion of patients with the events 
of hyperthyroidism and thyroiditis in the reference safety dataset for melanoma and NSCLC. The 
overall number and proportion of patients with hypothyroidism in the HL population in KN013,
KN087, and KN204 (n=389) was 66 (17%) (95%CI-13.4, 21.1); all events of hypothyroidism were 
Grade 1 and 2. The rate of hypothyroidism seen in HL subjects is likely to be secondary to the 
significant proportion of subjects with a history of radiation to the neck and/or mediastinum, and 
to a higher rate of pre-exisiting hypothyroidism among participants in this group at baseline.
The overall number and proportion of patients with hypothyroidism in the UC population in KN052 
(n=370) was 24 (6.5%) (95%CI-4.2,9.5) and in KN045 (n=266) was 17 (6.4%) (95%CI-3.8,10); of 
hyperthyroidism in the UC population in KN052 (n=370) was 9 (2.4%) (95%CI-1.1,4.6) and in 
KN045 (n=266) was 10 (3.8%) (95%CI-1.8,6.8); and of thyroiditis in the UC population in KN052 
(n=370)  was  3 (0.8%)  (95%CI-0.2,2.4)  and  in  KN045  (n=266)  was  2  (0.8%)  (95%CI-0.1,2.7), 
which  is  generally  similar  to  the  proportion  of  patients  with  the  events  of  hypothyroidism, 
hyperthyroidism, and thyroiditis in the reference safety dataset for melanoma and NSCLC.
The overall number and proportion of patients with hypothyroidism in the HNSCC population in 
KN040, KN012 and KN055 (n=609) was 92 (15.1%) (95% CI-12.4, 18.2); the majority of these 
events  were  Grade  1  and  2.  In  view  of  the  history  of  these  subjects  and  the  known  risk  of 
hypothyroidism  in  the  HNSCC  population,  the  higher  rate  of  hypothyroidism  in  the  HNSCC 
population when compared with the reference safety dataset largely reflects disease-related risk 
factors.  The  overall  number  and  proportion  of  patients  with  hyperthyroidism  in  the  HNSCC 
population  in  KN040,  KN012  and  KN055  (n=609) was  10  (1.6%)  (95%  CI-0.8,  3),  which  is 
generally similar to the proportion of patients with the events of hyperthyroidism in the reference 
safety dataset for melanoma and NSCLC. The number and proportion of patients with thyroiditis 
in the HNSCC population in KN040, KN012 and KN055 (n=609) was 3 (0.5%) (95% CI-0.1, 1.4), 
which are generally similar to the proportion of patients with the events of hyperthyroidism in the 
reference safety dataset for melanoma and NSCLC.
The overall number and proportion of patients with hypothyroidism in the HNSCC population in 
KN048  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  group  (n=300),  was  54  (18%)  (95%  CI-13.8,22.8);  of 
hyperthyroidism was 8 (2.7%) (95% CI-1.2,5.2); there were no cases of thyroiditis reported.  The 
overall  number  and  proportion  of  patients  with  hypothyroidism  in  the  HNSCC  population  in 
KN048 pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group (n=276), was 42 (15.2%) (95% CI-11.2,20); of 
hyperthyroidism was  13 (4.7%)   (95% CI-2.5,7.9); and of thyroiditis was 1 (0.4%) (95% CI-0,2) 
in  the  HNSCC  population  in  KN048  pembrolizumab  plus  chemotherapy  group  (n=276).The 
proportion of patients with events of hypothyroidism in KN048 although somewhat more common 
than in the reference safety dataset were generally consistent in nature with the proportion of events 
of hypothyroidism previously reported for pembrolizumab use in the HNSCC population.
In the melanoma population in KN054 (n=509), the overall number and proportion of patients with 
events hypothyroidism was 75 (14.7%) (95% CI-11.8,18.1); of hyperthyroidism was 53 (10.4%) 
(95% CI-7.9,13.4); and of thyroiditis was 16 (3.1%) (95% CI-1.8, 5.1).  The proportion of patients 
with  events  of  hypothyroidism,  hyperthyroidism  and  thyroiditis  in  KN054  although  somewhat 
more  common  than  in  the  reference  safety  dataset  were  generally  consistent  in  nature  with  the

(Hypothyroidism, Hyperthyroidism, Thyroiditis)
proportion of events of hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism and thyroiditis previously reported for 
pembrolizumab.
The overall number and proportion of patients with hypothyroidism in the NSCLC population in 
KN407 and KN021 (Cohort A) (n=303), was 24 (7.9%) (95%CI-5.1, 11.6), the overall number and 
proportion  of  patients  with  hyperthyroidism  was  20  (6.6%)  (95%  CI- 4.1,10),  and  the  overall 
number and proportion of patients with thyroiditis was 3 (1%) (95%CI-0.2,2.9), which is generally 
similar  to  the  proportion  of  patients  with  the  events  of  hypothyroidism,  hyperthyroidism,  and 
thyroiditis in the reference safety dataset for melanoma and NSCLC.
In the RCC population in KN426 pembrolizumab plus axitinib (n=429) the overall number and 
proportion  of  patients  with  hypothyroidism  was  152  (35.4%)  (95%  CI-30.9,40.2);  of 
hyperthyroidism was 55 (12.8%) (95% CI-9.8,16.4); and of thyroiditis was 12 (2.8%) (95% CI-
1.5,4.8). Hypothyroidism  is  a  known  ADR  of  axitinib  therapy,  and  axitinib  contributes  to  the 
incidence  of  hypothyroidism  in  this  combination.  The  proportion  of  patients  with  events  of 
hypothyroidism,  hyperthyroidism  and  thyroiditis  in  KN426  although  more  common  than  in  the 
reference  safety  dataset  were  generally  consistent  in  nature  with  the  proportion  of  events  of 
hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism and thyroiditis previously reported for pembrolizumab.
In the in the CRC population in KN177 (n=153) the overall number and proportion of patients with 
hypothyroidism was 19 (12.4%) (95% CI-7.6,18.7); of hyperthyroidism was 6 (3.9%) (95% CI-
1.5,8.3); and of thyroiditis was 2 (1.3%) (95% CI-0.2,4.6). Hypothyroidism was reported more 
frequently in the KN177 pembrolizumab safety dataset compared with the RSD (12.4% vs 8.5%, 
respectively); however, when adjusted for exposure, the incidences were similar.  The proportion 
of  patients  with  events  of  hypothyroidism,  hyperthyroidism  and  thyroiditis  in  KN177  were 
generally consistent in nature with the proportion of events of hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism 
and thyroiditis previously reported for pembrolizumab.
In the esophageal cancer population in KN590 pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (n=370), the 
overall number and proportion of patients with hypothyroidism was 40 (10.8%) (95% CI-7.8,14.4); 
of hyperthyroidism was 21 (5.7%) (95% CI-3.5,8.5); and of thyroiditis 1 (0.3%) (95% CI-0,1.5), 
which  are  generally  similar  to  the  proportion  of  patients  with  the  events  of  hypothyroidism, 
hyperthyroidism, and thyroiditis in the reference safety dataset for melanoma and NSCLC.
In the TNBC population in KN355 pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group (n=596) the overall 
number and proportion of patients with hyperthyroidism was 31 (5.2%) (95% CI-3.6,7.3); and of 
thyroiditis was 8 (1.3%) (95% CI-0.6,2.6), which are generally similar to the proportion of patients 
with the events of hyperthyroidism and thyroiditis in the reference safety dataset for melanoma and 
NSCLC. The overall number and proportion of patients with hypothyroidism was 95 (15.9%) (95% 
CI-13.1,19.1),  although  higher  than  in  the  reference  safety  dataset,  the  events  were  generally 
consistent  in  nature  with  the  proportion  of  events  of  hypothyroidism  previously  reported  for 
pembrolizumab.
In  the  RCC  population  in  KN581  pembrolizumab  plus  lenvatinib  (n=352),  the  number  and 
proportion of patients with thyroiditis was 2 (0.6%) (95% CI-0.1,2.0), which is generally similar to 
the proportion of patients with the events of thyroiditis in the reference safety dataset. The overall 
number  and proportion  of patients  with  hypothyroidism  was  166  (47.2%)  (95%  CI- 41.8,52.5), 
which although higher than hypothyroidism in the reference safety dataset, was generally consistent 
in nature with the proportion of events of hypothyroidism previously reported for pembrolizumab. 
The  overall  number  and  proportion of patients  with hyperthyroidism  was  28  (8.0%)  (95%  CI-
5.4,11.3),  which  although  higher  than  hyperthyroidism  in  the  reference  safety  dataset,  was
generally consistent in nature with the proportion of events of hyperthyroidism previously reported 
for pembrolizumab.
In  the  endometrial  carcinoma  population  in  KN146  and  KN775 pembrolizumab plus  lenvatinib 
(n=530) the overall number and proportion of patients with thyroiditis was 12 (2.3%) (95% CI-1.2, 
3.9), which is generally similar to the proportion of patients with the event of thyroiditis in the 
reference safety dataset. The overall number and proportion of patients with hypothyroidism was 
296 (55.8%) (95% CI-51.5, 60.1); and of hyperthyroidism was 54 (10.2%) (95% CI-7.7, 13.1). The 
proportion of patients with events of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism in KN146 and KN775,

although higher in frequency than in the reference safety dataset, were generally consistent in nature 
with  the proportion  of events  of  hypothyroidism  and  hyperthyroidism  previously  reported  for 
pembrolizumab.
The  overall  number  and  proportion  of patients  with hypothyroidism  in  the  RCC  population  in 
KN564  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  (n=488)  was  103  (21.1%)  (95%  CI-17.6,25);  of

with  thyroiditis  was  6  (1.2%)  (95%  CI-0.5,2.7),  which  was  generally  consistent  to  the  overall 
proportion of patients with the events of hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and thyroiditis in the 
reference  safety  dataset.  The  proportion  of  patients  with  events  of  hypothyroidism  and 
hyperthyroidism  in  KN564  although  more  common  than  in  the  reference  safety  dataset  were 
generally consistent in nature with the proportion of events of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism 
previously reported for pembrolizumab.
In the MSI-H population in KN158 Cohort K and KN164 Cohorts A and B (n=475), the overall 
number and proportion of patients with hypothyroidism was 53 (11.2%) (95% CI-8.5, 14.3) and of 
hyperthyroidism was 25 (5.3%) (95% CI-3.4, 7.7), which is generally similar to the proportion of 
patients  with  the  events  of  hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism in  the  reference  safety  dataset. 
There  were  no  patients  with  events  of  thyroiditis  reported  in  the  MSI-H  population  in  KN158

Risk Factors and 
Risk Groups:
No  specific  risk  factors  for  thyroid  disorders  (hyperthyroidism,  hypothyroidism,  thyroiditis) 
associated with pembrolizumab have been identified.
Preventability:
Although  the  development  of  thyroid  disorders  (hypothyroidism,  hyperthyroidism,  thyroiditis) 
cannot be completely prevented; patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of thyroid
disorders  (hypothyroidism,  hyperthyroidism,  thyroiditis)  and  if  they develop,  other  causes 
excluded.  Withholding/discontinuation  of  pembrolizumab and  appropriate  medical  intervention
including  corticosteroids 
(hypothyroidism, 
the  onset  of
hyperthyroidism, thyroiditis) may result in recovery.

Impact on the Risk-
Benefit Balance of 
the Product:
Severe thyroid disorders (hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and thyroiditis) may be reported to be 
life-threating or fatal in individual patients. However, given the fatal outcome of untreated cancer, 
the risk of thyroid disorders which generally can be managed, is outweighed by the potential benefit 
of pembrolizumab treatment.
Public Health 
Impact:
This risk has minimal public health impact outside its effect on individual patients.

Potential 
Mechanisms: 
Immune-mediated Endocrinopathies-Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM)
Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly-selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the 
Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)/kappa isotype directed to the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) 
receptor and designed to directly block the interaction between the receptor and its ligands, PD-
L1 and PD-L2.  The PD-1 pathway represents a major immune control switch which may be 
engaged by tumor cells to overcome active T-cell immune surveillance.  T-cell activation in 
proximity to normal tissue may lead to inflammation and injury to normal tissue.
Evidence Source(s) 
and Strength of 
Evidence:
Review of pembrolizumab clinical trial data, post-marketing experience and literature regarding 
endocrinopathies- type 1 diabetes mellitus represent sufficient evidence of a causal association 
with pembrolizumab exposure.

In the TNBC population in KN522 pembrolizumab in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
followed by continued adjuvant pembrolizumab monotherapy group (n=783) there were 2 (0.3%)
patients with Grade 3 events and 2 (0.3%) patients with Grade 4 events of T1DM. There were no 
patients with Grade 5 events of T1DM reported.
In the melanoma population in KN716 pembrolizumab monotherapy (n=483), there was 1 (0.2%) 
patient with a Grade 3 and 1 (0.2%) patient with a Grade 4 event of T1DM. There were no patients 
with Grade 5 events of T1DM.
In the gastric cancer population in KN811 pembrolizumab combination therapy (n=350), there was 
1 (0.3%) patient with a Grade 3 event of T1DM. There were no patients with Grade 4 or Grade 5 
events of T1DM.
In  the  NSCLC  population  in  KN091  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  (n=580) there  was  1  (0.2%) 
patient with a Grade 3 event of T1DM.  There were no patients with Grade 4 or 5 events of T1DM.
In the gastric cancer population in KN859 pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (n=785), there were  
4 (0.5%) patients with a Grade 3 and 1 (0.1%) patient with a Grade 4 event of T1DM reported.
There were no patients with a Grade 5 events of T1DM.
In  the  global  safety database  through  31-DEC-2017,  (pembrolizumab  monotherapy  trials only), 
there was 1 Grade 5 clinical trial report of T1DM.  
Review  of  pembrolizumab  clinical  trial  data  from  ongoing  studies  and  postmarketing  data 
regarding immune-mediated endocrinopathies- Type I diabetes mellitus, including fatal cases, is 
consistent with the risk as characterized in this RMP.
No specific risk factors for Type I DM associated with pembrolizumab have been identified.
Although the development of Type I DM cannot be completely prevented; patients should be
monitored for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Insulin should be 
administered for type 1 diabetes, and pembrolizumab should be withheld in cases of Grade 3
hyperglycaemia until metabolic control is achieved.
Impact on the Risk-
Benefit Balance of 
the Product:
Diabetes mellitus and diabetic ketoacidosis can be life-threatening or fatal in individual patients. 
Given the fatal outcome of untreated cancer, the risk of TIDM is outweighed by the potential 
benefit of pembrolizumab treatment.
Public Health 
Impact:
This risk has minimal public health impact outside its effect on individual patients.

Details of Important Potential Risk:   For Hematologic 
Malignancies: Increased Risk of Severe Complications of 
Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation (SCT) in Patients Who 
Have Previously Received Pembrolizumab
Important Potential 
Risk:  
For hematologic malignancies: increased risk of severe complications of allogeneic stem cell 
transplantation (SCT) in patients who have previously received pembrolizumab
Potential 
Mechanisms: 
The safety and efficacy of HSCT may be different in patients previously exposed to PD-1 
inhibitors, given their immunomodulatory mechanism and their prolonged clinical activity. 
Specifically, residual PD-1 inhibition peri- and post-SCT could enhance allogeneic T-cell 
responses, which could augment the graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect but also increase the 
incidence or severity of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and other immune complications of 
SCT.
Evidence Source(s) 
and Strength of 
Evidence:
Review of pembrolizumab literature regarding increased risk of severe complications of 
allogeneic stem cell transplantation in patients who have previously received pembrolizumab 
represents scientific evidence of a possible causal association with pembrolizumab exposure.

Severity and Nature 
of the Risk
Unknown
A case series has been presented in the literature [Ref. 5.4: 04FG2Z] that describes a cohort of 
patients who received PD-1 inhibitors and went on to receive allogeneic SCT.  An increased risk 
of severe complications, including graft versus host disease (GVHD) and veno-occlusive disease 
of the liver was noted.  In addition, the US product circular for nivolumab [Ref. 5.4: 04GJ9J]
describes severe complications of allogeneic SCT following prior nivolumab therapy.  Fatal 
outcomes have been reported.
Hepatic VOD and severe GVHD (which can include skin, liver and gastrointestinal symptoms), 
including fatal reports, have been reported in patients who have undergone allogeneic stem cell 
transplant following pembrolizumab therapy.  Review of the reports does not provide sufficient 
evidence for a causal relationship between an increased risk of severe complications of 
allogeneic transplant and prior pembrolizumab therapy. Therefore, this is presented as a potential 
risk in this RMP.  
Risk Factors and 
Risk Groups:
Patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing allogeneic SCT who were previously treated 
with a PD-inhibitor.
Preventability:
These complications are preventable if patients do not undergo allogeneic SCT following PD-1
therapy; however, hematologic malignancy patients who are candidates for allogeneic SCT have 
generally exhausted other treatment options.
Impact on the Risk-
Benefit Balance of 
the Product:
These complications may be fatal in individual patients. However, given the fatal outcome of 
untreated lymphoma in patients who have exhausted other treatment alternatives and that the 
limited data available suggests that these complications can be medically managed in the 
majority of cases, the risk is outweighed by the potential benefit.
Public Health 
Impact:
This risk has minimal public health impact outside its effect on individual patients.

a History of Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant (SCT)
Important Potential 
Risk:  
Potential 
Mechanisms: 
GVHD after pembrolizumab administration in patients with a history of allogeneic SCT
The anti-tumor effect of allogeneic SCT is based upon donor stem cells reconstituting an immune 
system, thereby allowing for a potent graft versus tumor (GVT) effect, but also creating a 
significant risk of GVHD. GVHD occurs due to the donor’s immune system recognizing 
recipient major (MHC) or minor histocompatibility antigens, exacerbated by tissue damage 
caused by conditioning regimens. One of the major physiologic mechanisms responsible for 
maintaining immune tolerance in this setting is the attenuation of donor T-cell response caused 
by ligation of the PD1 receptor on donor T lymphocytes to its ligands on recipient tissue.  
Disruption of this immune axis by PD1 inhibition, while promoting GVT effect, may also 
increase the risk of GVHD.

Impact:

Published literature has suggested that a PD-1 inhibitor (nivolumab) may have induced fatal and 
serious GVHD given post-allogeneic SCT. 
Two case series, primarily involving nivolumab, have been published in the literature, suggesting 
that PD-1 therapy in patients who have undergone allogeneic SCT are at risk of developing 
GVHD. Importantly, these case series identify a risk factor of a history of GVHD after 
allogeneic SCT. Furthermore, it was observed that those patients who developed GVHD 
following PD-1-inhibitor therapy were, on average, closer to their allogeneic SCT than those who 
did not develop GVHD following treatment with PD-1-inhibitors. 
Currently there is very little direct experience with pembrolizumab in this setting by which to 
estimate any potential effect. In the clinical trial database, there are 5 subjects who received an 
allogeneic SCT 5 or more years before pembrolizumab treatment. Three of these had a history of 
GVHD with the allogeneic SCT; however, none developed GVHD after receiving 
pembrolizumab. Therefore, this is presented as a potential risk in this RMP.
Patients with a history of allogeneic SCT treated with a PD-1 inhibitor.
These complications are preventable if patients do not undergo allogeneic SCT prior to PD-1 
therapy.   However, hematologic malignancy patients who have undergone allogeneic SCT and 
subsequently relapse or develop a secondary malignancy and may be candidates for 
pembrolizumab therapy have generally exhausted other treatment options.
These complications may be fatal in individual patients. However, given the fatal outcome of 
untreated lymphoma in patients who have exhausted other treatment alternatives and that the 
limited data available suggests that these complications can be medically managed in the 
majority of cases, as well as the need for therapeutic alternatives in patients who have a medical 
history of allogeneic SCT and then develop secondary malignancy, the risk is outweighed by the 
potential benefit.
This risk has minimal public health impact outside its effect on individual patients.

PART III: PHARMACOVIGILANCE PLAN (INCLUDING POST-
AUTHORISATION SAFETY STUDIES)
III.1
Routine Pharmacovigilance Activities
The MAH maintains systems and standard practices for routine pharmacovigilance activities 
to collect reports of suspected adverse reactions (including spontaneous reports, reports from 
clinical studies, reports of pregnancy/lactation exposures, overdoses and medication errors); 
prepare reports for regulatory authorities (e.g. individual case safety reports, Periodic Safety 
Update Reports (PSURs), etc.), and maintain continuous monitoring of the safety profile of 
approved  products  (including  signal  detection,  issue  evaluation,  updating  of  labeling,  and 
liaison with regulatory authorities).  The MAH maintains a Pharmacovigilance System Master 
File which contains details of these systems and standard practices.
MAH-sponsored clinical trials are being conducted in multiple different tumor types including 
but not limited to: melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, hematologic malignancies, bladder 
tumors, and multiple other solid tumor types that will continue to inform the safety profile of 
pembrolizumab.  All  of  these  on-going  and  planned  clinical  trials  will  continue  to  provide 
valuable data and help to inform the MAH regarding ongoing safety concerns and to identify 
future safety signals.

Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions Objective and Rationale:
Receipt of educational material will reinforce communication of the information 
in the SmPC from prescribers to their patients and are intended to help minimize 
the risk of immune-mediated reactions in clinical practice. Patient educational 
material in the form of patient card will enable patient awareness of side effects
and early recognition of immune mediated events supporting risk Minimisation.
Proposed Actions:
Educational materials:
•
Patient Card
Healthcare providers will distribute the Patient Card to the patients/caregivers to 
educate them about symptoms of immune-mediated adverse reactions.
Patients will receive: 


Information about key symptoms that need to be reported immediately to 
the physician/nurse. 
Instruction on the importance of carrying the wallet-sized Patient Card at 
all times, to show it at medical visits to healthcare professionals other than 
the prescriber.
How  Effectiveness  of  the  Risk  Minimisation  Measures  for  the  Safety 
Concern Will be Measured:
Implementation:


Communication via direct mail
to oncologists, oncology nurses  and 
oncology  pharmacists  who  treat patients  with  the  approved  indication(s).
The records of the mailer will be used to track the risk Minimisation activity.
Training of the local  country  staff on  the patient  card  and on the need  to 
provide the material to new prescribers will be completed.  Records of the 
training will be maintained.
Clinical outcomes:


The  MAH’s educational plan  will  encourage patients  to  report  signs  and 
symptoms associated with immune-mediated reactions to their HCPs. 
Information  from  ongoing  pharmacovigilance  activities  will  assess 
appropriate  recognition  and  management  of  immune-mediated adverse
reactions and that the events observed in real world use are consistent with 
the  cases  observed  in  the  clinical  trial  program  and  characterized  in  the 
SmPC and patient card.
Criteria  for  Judging  the  Success  of  the  Proposed  Risk  Minimisation 
Measure(s):
Clinical features of reported Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) are reviewed to 
ensure consistency with both the known safety profile of pembrolizumab and also 
with appropriate medical management guidelines in the SmPC. Upon review of 
the data, appropriate measures will be considered if new information is obtained 
that indicates that additional risk minimisation measures are warranted.
Planned Date(s) for Assessment:
Proposed review period:

Data will be reviewed as part of routine pharmacovigilance processes and 
will  be  presented  in  the  PSUR  if  clinically  meaningful  new  safety 
information is identified.

PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN BY PRODUCT
Summary of risk management plan for pembrolizumab
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for pembrolizumab. The RMP details 
important  risks  of  pembrolizumab,  how  these  risks  can  be  minimised,  and  how  more 
information will  be  obtained  about  pembrolizumab’s  risks  and  uncertainties  (missing 
information).
Pembrolizumab's  Summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how pembrolizumab should 
be used.

Risks Associated With the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further 
Characterise the Risks
Important  risks  of pembrolizumab,  together  with  measures  to  minimise  such  risks  and  the
proposed studies for learning more about pembrolizumab's risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
• Specific  information,  such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on  correct  use, in  the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
• Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
• The authorised pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly;
• The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.
In  the  case  of  pembrolizumab,  these  measures  are  supplemented  with  additional  risk 
minimisation measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. In addition to these 
measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected  continuously  and  regularly
analysed, including PSUR assessment - so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. 
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. If important information that 
 
 
may  affect  the  safe  use  of  pembrolizumab  is  not  yet  available,  it  is  listed  under  ‘missing 
information’ below.
II.A
List of Important Risks and Missing Information
Important  risks  of  pembrolizumab  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to 
further  investigate  or  minimise  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely 
administered.  Important  risks  can  be  regarded  as  identified or  potential.  Identified risks  are 
concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of pembrolizumab. Potential 
risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on 
available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. 
Missing  information  refers  to  information  on the  safety  of  the  medicinal  product  that  is 
currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).
Pembrolizumab  has  been  on  the  market  since  July  of  2015.  Risk  minimization  activities 
recommending specific clinical measures to address the risks have become fully integrated into 
standard clinical practice, such as inclusion into treatment protocols or clinical guidelines. The 
identified risks in the EU RMP are: Immune-mediated adverse reactions.
The  potential  risks  in  the EU  RMP  include:  an  increased  risk  of  severe  complications  of 
allogeneic  stem  cell  transplantation  (SCT)  in  patients  who  have  previously  received 
pembrolizumab and Graft versus host disease (GVHD) after pembrolizumab administration in 
patients with a history of allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT).

Patients with a history of non-infectious pneumonitis that required steroids or 
current pneumonitis were excluded from the clinical trials.  These patients are 
considered to be a risk group for the development of pneumonitis; in the interim 
analysis of the KN001 NSCLC cohort, possible risk factors identified that might 
predispose subjects to pneumonitis were a documented history of prior thoracic 
radiation to the chest (≥30Gy). According to the literature, risk factors for 
interstitial lung disease may include occupational exposure to toxins, chest 
irradiation, some chemotherapies, smoking and advanced age.
Colitis
No specific risk factors for colitis and diarrhea associated with pembrolizumab were 
identified.

ANNEXES
 
 
ANNEX 4 – SPECIFIC ADVERSE DRUG REACTION FOLLOW-UP FORMS
This RMP annex is not applicable.
 
 
ANNEX 6 – DETAILS OF PROPOSED ADDITIONAL RISK MINIMISATION 
ACTIVITIES
Risk Minimisation Activity: Educational material
The  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  shall  ensure  that  all  physicians  who  are 
expected to prescribe pembrolizumab are provided with the Patient Cards.
Overview of Implementation
 The MAH will ensure distribution of the educational material; details on the exact target 
audience  for  the  communications/materials  and  the  specifics  of  the  risk  minimisation 
materials will be agreed with the National Competent Authorities.


In  addition, the MAH will train the local MSD country staff on the patient card and on 
the  need  to  provide  the  material  to  new  prescribers.    Records  of  the  training  will  be 
maintained.    The  records  of  the  mailer  will  be  tracked  and  be  used  to  report  on  the 
implementation of the risk minimization activity.
Information from ongoing pharmacovigilance activities (routine pharmacovigilance) will 
assess  appropriate  recognition  and  management  of  immune-mediated  adverse  reactions
and that the events observed in real world use are consistent with the cases observed in 
the clinical trial program and characterized in the SmPC and patient educational material.
Patient Card
Key elements:

Information that pembrolizumab can cause serious side effects in many parts of the body 
that can get worse, can sometimes become life-threatening and lead to death, and need to 
be addressed immediately by the patient communicating with the treating physician
 Description  of  the  main  symptoms  of immune-mediated  adverse  reactions and  the 
importance of notifying their treating physician immediately if symptoms occur, persist, 
or worsen:
o Lungs: shortness of breath, chest pain, or coughing)
o Intestines:  diarrhoea  or  more  bowel  movements  than  usual,  black,  tarry,  sticky 
stools or stools with blood or mucus, or severe stomach pain or tenderness
o Liver: nausea or vomiting, pain on the right side of stomach, yellowing of skin or 
whites of eyes, dark urine, or bleeding or bruising more easily than normal
o Kidneys: changes in the amount or colour of your urine
 
 
o Hormone  glands  (especially  the  thyroid,  pituitary,  and  adrenal  glands):  rapid 
heartbeat,  weight  loss,  increased  sweating,  weight  gain,  hair  loss,  feeling  cold, 
constipation,  deeper  voice,  muscle  aches,  dizziness  or  fainting,  headaches  that 
will not go away 
o Type 1 diabetes, including diabetic ketoacidosis (acid in the blood produced from 
diabetes):  feeling  more  hungry or  thirsty,  needing  to  urinate  more  often, weight 
loss,  feeling  tired  or  feeling  sick,  stomach  pain,  fast  and  deep  breathing, 
confusion,  unusual  sleepiness,  a  sweet  smell  to  your  breath,  a  sweet  or  metallic 
taste in your mouth, or a different odour to your urine or sweat
 The  importance  of  not  attempting  to  self-treat  any  symptoms  without  consulting  their 
Healthcare Professional first
 Placeholder including the weblink of the Package Leaflet on the EMA website
 The  importance  of  carrying  the  wallet-sized  Patient  Card  at  all  times,  to  show  it  at  all 
medical  visits  to  healthcare  professionals  other  than  the  prescriber  (e.g.  emergency 
healthcare professionals). The Card reminds patients about key symptoms that need to be 
reported  immediately  to  the  physician/  nurse.  It  also  contains  prompts  to  enter  contact 
details  of  the  treating  physician  and  to  alert  other  physicians  that  the  patient  is  treated 
with pembrolizumab.
The  MAH shall  agree  to  the  format  and  content  of  the  above  material  with  the  National 
Competent Authority prior to launch in the Member State.

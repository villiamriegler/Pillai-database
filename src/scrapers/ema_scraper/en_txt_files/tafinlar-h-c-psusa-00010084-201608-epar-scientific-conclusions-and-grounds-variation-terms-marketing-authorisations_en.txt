Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for dabrafenib, the scientific  conclusions 
of CHMP are as follows: 
Based on a total of 9 cases of gastrointestinal perforation cumulatively reported with dabrafenib 
monotherapy and considering that the trametinib SmPC has been updated to include gastrointestinal 
perforations for the combination therapy trametinib/dabrafenib and considering the potentially 
life-threatening nature of these events, the PRAC considered that the dabrafenib SmPC should be 
updated to include gastrointestinal perforations as a new warning and as a new adverse drug reaction 
with an ‘uncommon’ frequency. 
Based on a cumulative review of ‘Gastrointestinal disorders (diarrhoea, colitis, and gastroinstestinal 
perforation)’, taking into account that the trametinib SmPC has been updated to include colitis as a  
new warning and as a new adverse drug reaction for the combination therapy trametinib/dabrafenib 
and considering the potentially serious nature of colitis, the PRAC considered that the dabrafenib  SmPC 
should be updated to include colitis reported with combination therapy as a new warning and as  a new 
adverse drug reaction with an ‘uncommon’ frequency. 
Based on a new reported case of myocarditis in a patient on dabrafenib and trametinib combination 
therapy with a positive dechallenge to combination therapy, considering that the trametinib SmPC has 
been updated with information on myocarditis and taking into account the potentially life-threatening 
nature of myocarditis, the PRAC considered that the dabrafenib SmPC should be updated to include 
‘myocarditis’ as a new adverse drug reaction with a ‘not known’ frequency. 
Dabrafenib was shown to be phototoxic in non-clinical studies being part of the authorisation 
application. Based on 33 cases of photosensitivity from the post-marketing setting, including one 
serious/severe case was reported with positive de- and re-challenge to dabrafenib/trametinib 
combination therapy, the PRAC considered that ‘photosensitivity reaction’ should be included as a  new 
adverse drug reaction in the dabrafenib SmPC with a ‘common’ frequency. 
Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR, the PRAC considered that changes to 
the product information of medicinal products containing dabrafenib were warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for dabrafenib the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing dabrafenib is unchanged subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation should be varied.

Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSURs for Bretaris Genuair and Eklira 
Genuair, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:  
There are no new data on efficacy and no new major safety concerns have been identified during the 
period of review.  
There were a number of cases (8) reported where patients did not use the Genuair device correctly 
and where doses were missed as a result. Extensive instructions on correct use of the device are 
already included in the Patient Information Leaflet and SmPC. However, in contrast to the majority of 
inhaled COPD medications, the SmPC does not advise prescribers that patients should be instructed on 
the correct use of the device. Therefore, in view of the data regarding reports of patients not using the 
Genuair device correctly, the PRAC considered that changes to the product information were 
warranted.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s)  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Bretaris Genuair and Eklira Genuair the CHMP is of the 
opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal products containing the active substance 
aclidinium bromide is favourable subject to the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisations should be varied.

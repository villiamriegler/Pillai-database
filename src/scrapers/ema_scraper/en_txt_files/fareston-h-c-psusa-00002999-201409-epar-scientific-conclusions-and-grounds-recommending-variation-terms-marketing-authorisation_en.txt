Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for TOREMIFENE, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
The chronological, clinical and biological data strongly suggested that toremifene can increase 
transaminase levels and also potentially induce severe acute liver injury with a predominant 
hepatocellular pattern of biological abnormalities, occurring within 3 months of treatment in 90% of 
cases with known treatment duration. Potentially severe liver injury was observed in 39.5% of patients 
of whom two developed fulminant hepatic failure.  
In addition, with regards to the risk of drug interactions, no particular signal suggestive of drug 
interaction with toremifene as a substrate or an enzyme inhibitor emerged from the data submitted by 
the MAH. However, in order to provide clear information to the prescriber, the PRAC recommended that 
the product information should be amended to list relevant examples of drugs known to inhibit the CYP 
3A enzyme system and to delete troleandomycin which is not further marketed.  
Therefore, in view of available data regarding toremifene, the PRAC considered that changes to the 
product information were warranted.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for TOREMIFENE the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing TOREMIFENE is favourable subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied.

procedure) 
2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2017 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing autologous T lymphocyte-
enriched population of cells transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding a chimeric antigen 
receptor targeting human B cell maturation antigen with 4-1BB and CD3-zeta intracellular 
signalling domains was considered justified based on data showing that patients with relapsed/ 
refractory multiple myeloma achieve partial or complete responses; 
the condition is chronically debilitating and life threatening due to the poor survival of patients with 
relapsed or refractory disease; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 3.6 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made; 
although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the European 
Union, the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal 
product containing autologous T lymphocyte-enriched population of cells transduced with a 
lentiviral vector encoding a chimeric antigen receptor targeting human B cell maturation antigen 
with 4-1BB and CD3-zeta intracellular signalling domains will be of significant benefit to those 
affected by the condition. The sponsor has provided clinical data that demonstrate that patients 
with relapsed/ refractory multiple myeloma achieve partial and stringent complete responses. This 
compared favourably with a long list of authorised products to which these patients were not 
responding anymore. The Committee considered that this constitutes a clinically relevant 
advantage. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Multiple myeloma (also called plasma cell myeloma) is a malignant neoplasm of plasma cells that 
clonally expand and accumulate in the bone marrow (BM) and/or extramedullary sites, leading to bone 
destruction, infections, renal insufficiency, and marrow failure (Dimopoulos et al, 2015). The disease is 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000035635 
Page 4/10 
 
 
 
 
 
often asymptomatic for a long period of time and therefore is often advanced at the time of diagnosis. 
MM is most frequently diagnosed among people >65 years of age and the median age at onset in 
Europe is 72 years. The incidence rates increase with age, particularly after the age of 40 years, and 
men are more likely to develop the disease than women. The aetiology is unknown with no established 
lifestyle, occupational or environmental risk factors. 
The clinical course of MM can be highly variable due to the heterogeneity of the disease with some 
patients progressing rapidly despite treatment and others remaining stable without therapy for a 
number of years. Common symptoms of MM include, but are not limited to, fatigue, persistent bone 
pain, pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression (from pathologic fracture), weakness, malaise, 
anaemia and/or bleeding, frequent infections (often pneumococcal), hypercalcemia, renal failure, and 
neuropathies. 
The understanding of MM and its classification has not changed since the initial orphan designation. 
The approved therapeutic indication “Treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple 
myeloma who have received at least three prior therapies, including an immunomodulatory agent, a 
proteasome inhibitor and an anti CD38 antibody and have demonstrated disease progression on the 
last therapy” falls within the scope of the designated orphan condition “Treatment of multiple 
myeloma”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CAT/ CHMP 
on the basis of the submitted evidence including data from the pivotal single-arm, phase 2 study MM-
001. Abecma received a conditional marketing authorisation (CMA). For a full discussion of the results 
and the justification of the CMA, please refer to the European Public Assessment Report of Abecma. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
Multiple myeloma is a largely incurable blood cancer characterized by the clonal proliferation of 
malignant plasma cells both within the bone marrow and at localized extramedullary sites termed 
plasmacytomas (Rajkumar, 2016a). The malignant proliferation of the plasma cell clone causes 
increasing levels of monoclonal protein (M-protein) in the serum and urine and may result in bone 
marrow failure, suppression of uninvolved immunoglobulin levels, and skeletal destruction. Clinical 
complications of progressive MM include recurrent infections, cytopenias, renal failure, hyperviscosity 
syndrome, hypercalcemia, bone pain, and pathologic fractures (Munshi, 2012). 
Substantial progress has been made during the last decade in improving the overall survival (OS) of 
patients with MM through the development and availability of new approved treatment options. 
However, even with optimal upfront therapy and advances in treatment, most MM patients progress or 
relapse, and further treatment is needed. 
The condition therefore remains chronically debilitating and life-threatening in nature. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor claims that the calculation of prevalence of MM was conducted using data collected from 
the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study in 2017 by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation 
(IHME), combined with Eurostat 2017 mortality rates and 2018 population counts for each country. It 
is unclear where the data on prevalence come from and if only 5 EU member states were included in 
this analysis. The sponsor suggested that in 2020, MM is estimated to affect 2.29 in 10,000 persons in 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000035635 
Page 5/10 
 
 
 
 
 
the EU, with point prevalence estimates ranging from 1.65 per 10,000 persons in France to 2.69 per 
10,000 persons in Germany. The sponsor did not include any discussion of prevalence in the remaining 
22 EU member states in addition to France, The Netherlands, Spain, Germany and Italy. It is also not 
clear whether the sponsor attempted to calculate complete or partial prevalence. In addition, the 
proposed estimate is considerably lower than other estimates previously accepted in recent 
designations for MM with a value of approximately 4 in 10,000. Therefore, the sponsor was asked to 
submit a re-calculation based on relevant epidemiological studies and registers for MM, taking into 
consideration various sources of incidence and providing a good justification of the assumed duration 
of the disease.  
The point prevalence of MM has been recalculated as requested and was estimated to be affecting a 
range of between 3.68 to 4.88 per 10,000 people in the EU. The revised estimate was based on a 
sensitivity analysis conducted to address the uncertainty around the calculation and by use of data 
from the European Cancer Information System (ECIS). The sponsor used the standard formula P=I×D 
for indirectly establishing the prevalence of MM in the EU. The incidence of MM in the EU27 was 0.8 per 
10,000 people according to ECIS (2020 data). 
Since published data on the median overall survival (mOS) for the whole MM population is currently 
lacking, two factors should be taken into account when estimating the survival for all MM patients, 
namely eligibility for transplant and the international staging system (ISS) stage. A large proportion 
(30% to 40%) of MM patients are ISS Stage III and these patients have a reported mOS of 2 to 3 
years (Greipp, 2005; Cho, 2017; Kastritis, 2017; Usmani, 2018). MM patients with an ISS Stage I/II 
(60% to 70%) have a mOS of 6 to 7 years (Greipp, 2005; Cho, 2017; Kastritis, 2017; Usmani, 2018). 
Based on these data, the sponsor performed a sensitivity analysis to calculate the mOS for all patients 
with MM with the following assumptions: 
•  mOS for ISS stage I/II: 7 years (represents 60-70% of all MM patients) 
•  mOS for ISS stage III: 1-4 years (represents 30-40% of all MM patients) 
As variables in the sensitivity analysis, the sponsor used both the 30/70% or the 40/60% distribution, 
and a mOS of 1 to 4 years for the stage III group of patients. According to the sponsor, the proposed 
stage distribution was supported by published literature (single and multicentre studies) and 30% can 
be regarded as conservative starting point for the prevalence calculation. 
Based on the mOS assumptions for patients with ISS Stage I/II and III made in the sensitive analysis, 
a mOS for the whole MM population of 4.6 to 6.1 years was estimated, which resulted in a prevalence 
estimate within the range of 3.68 to 4.88 per 10,000 people. Based on these numbers, the sponsor 
calculated the mOS of the whole MM population to be 5.8 years ([7 years×0.6] + [4 years×0.4]). The 
prevalence was then indirectly estimated (P=IxD [0.8 × 5.8]) to 4.64 per 10,000 persons in the EU. 
This estimate is higher than the estimates accepted in recent MM designations, where a prevalence of 
approximately 4 in 10,000 people in the EU was concluded. However, the COMP considered that the 
adjusted prevalence estimate reflects better the recent influences of the rapidly evolving therapeutic 
field and increasing survival of patients with MM, and was therefore agreed to be accepted.

Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
The sponsor listed all authorised medicines used for the management of MM. Both the SmPC 
indications of authorised medicines as well as the treatment algorithms included in the treatment 
guidelines by ESMO and NCCN were referred to. Since the initial designation, 6 products were 
authorised for the treatment of MM, specifically Sarclisa (isatuximab), Empliciti (elotuzumab), Imnovid 
(pomalidomide), Darzalex (daratumumab), Blenrep (belantamab mafodotin), and Nexpovio (selinexor). 
Elotuzumab (Elo), pomalidomide (Pom), ixazomib (Ixa), carfilzomib (Cfz) and panobinostat (Pano) are 
authorized in the EU for use as doublet or triplet therapy in combination with dexamethasone (Dex) 
and either lenalidomide (Len), Pom or bortezomib (Btz). Approvals of these medicinal products were 
based on registration studies in relapsed/refractory (r/r) MM patients who had received 1 to 3 or 
≥ 2 prior regimens. These studies were not designed to address relapse after daratumumab (Dara) 
exposure and were not representative of the population targeted by ide-cel. 
Daratumumab is authorized in the r/r MM setting in the EU as either monotherapy for the treatment of 
adult patients with r/r MM whose prior therapy included a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an 
immunomodulatory agent (IMiD), or in combination with Len and Dex, or Btz and Dex, for the 
treatment of adult patients with MM who have received at least one prior therapy. There is no standard 
of care for patients with MM who have relapsed after prior exposure to Dara. The latest ESMO clinical 
practice guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of MM describe some of the recommended 
treatment options available for these patients (Moreau, Ann Oncol. 2017; 28(S4): iv52–61). However, 
the treatment algorithm for MM is evolving rapidly and the therapeutic field for the management of the 
condition is continually changing. 
Isatuximab, which is another anti-CD38 directed antibody, received a marketing authorisation (MA) in 
May 2020 in combination with Pom and Dex for the treatment of r/r MM patients who have received at 
least two prior lines of therapy, including Len and a PI, and whose disease had progressed on the last 
therapy.  
Currently, the two medicines belantamab mafotodin (Blenrep) and selinexor (Nexpovio) are indicated 
for the treatment of r/r MM patients who are triple- or quadruple-class refractory (i.e. refractory to 
IMiDs and PIs, and refractory or intolerant (or both) to an anti-CD38 directed antibody). These 
products are therefore considered relevant for the discussion on significant benefit because of the 
overlapping intended clinical setting. 
Significant benefit 
The sponsor performed a comparison of belantamab mafodotin (Blenrep), selinexor (Nexpovio) and 
ide-cel based on data from the three clinical studies DREAMM-2, STORM part 2 and MM-001. 
The patient populations enrolled in DREAMM-2 and STORM were comparable to that enrolled in study 
MM-001 in several key features (e.g., number of previous regimens, extensive exposure and 
refractoriness to major anti-myeloma therapy [AMT] classes). Eligible patients in all these three clinical 
studies had been exposed to ≥ 3 prior AMT regimens including an IMiD, a PI, and an anti-CD38 
antibody prior to enrolment. All three studies enrolled patient populations that had received a median 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000035635 
Page 7/10 
 
 
 
 
 
number of prior regimens of 6 to 8. In addition, as per the inclusion criteria, all patients in DREAMM-2 
were triple-class refractory, meaning that they were refractory to an IMiD, a PI, and an anti-CD38 
antibody. The patient population in STORM part 2 were even more heavily pre-treated and had 
received at least four prior regimens. All patients enrolled in this study were penta-refractory (defined 
as refractory to two IMiDs, two PIs, and one anti-CD38 antibody). In study MM--001, 89.1% and 
84.4% of the enrolled patients were double refractory (refractory to an IMiD and a PI) or triple 
refractory, respectively, and 25.8% were penta-refractory. Thus, a comparison of efficacy using these 
three therapies is considered reasonable. A table overview has been provided outlining the reported 
outcomes of ide-cel for both the enrolled and infused patient populations in comparison to the data 
from the registration studies of belantamab mafotodin monotherapy and selinexor in combination with 
dexamethasone, for which phase 2 data in the relevant triple-class-exposed MM patient population are 
available (see table 1 below).

The comparison between three single-arm studies is, technically, not very informative in terms of 
quantifying the effects observed. However, taking into consideration similar characteristics of the 
patient populations enrolled in these studies, and the fact that ide-cel seemed to perform significantly 
better than both belantamab mafodotin and selinexor in terms of higher overall response rate (ORR) 
and longer duration of response (DOR), the improved efficacy of this product is accepted. Therefore, 
the arguments of significant benefit over currently authorised methods of treatment for the target r/r 
MM population can be accepted based on improved efficacy.  
In addition, the sponsor claims a significant benefit based on major contribution to patient care over 
other approved therapies, which require continuous dosing. Ide-cel is a one-time infusion with 
expected onset of acute on-target toxicities primarily occurring in the first weeks after infusion. 
Patients treated with ide-cel achieving a durable response can therefore expect a significant treatment-
free interval and potential improvement in quality of life. According to the sponsor, this is supported by 
the assessments of the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) data derived from study MM-001.

It is acknowledged that patients who achieve a durable response to ide-cel are expected to obtain a 
significant treatment-free interval that potentially might be accompanied with improvement in quality 
of life. However, the claim that ide-cel also offers a major contribution to patient care over other 
approved therapies is currently not considered supported by the available HRQoL data from the pivotal 
study MM-001. Hence, this argument cannot be used to further support significant benefit of ide-cel in 
MM.  
The COMP concluded that Abecma is of significant benefit because of the improved efficacy. A higher 
proportion of clinically meaningful responses were observed in r/r MM patients treated with Abecma 
compared to patients treated with either Blenrep or Nexpovio. Furthermore, the observed responses 
were more durable. This is considered to constitute a clinically relevant advantage for adult patients 
with r/r MM who have received at least three prior therapies, including an IMiD, a PI, and an anti-CD38 
directed antibody.

4.  COMP position adopted on 30 June 2021 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of multiple myeloma (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to 
remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be approximately 4.6 in 10,000 persons in the 
European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating and life-threatening due to the development of 
hypercalcaemia, renal insufficiency, anaemia and bone lesions;  
although satisfactory methods for the treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union, the assumption that Abecma may be of potential significant benefit to those 
affected by the orphan condition still holds; 
the sponsor has provided clinical data that demonstrated efficacy of Abecma in heavily pre-treated 
multiple myeloma patients who had relapsed or were refractory to several classes of products after 
at least three prior therapies (including an immunomodulatory drug, a proteasome inhibitor and an 
anti-CD38 antibody), and whose disease had progressed on the last therapy. These patients 
achieved a higher proportion of clinically meaningful responses than patients treated with either 
Blenrep or Nexpovio, and the observed responses were more durable. The Committee considers 
that this constitutes a clinically relevant advantage. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Abecma, autologous T 
lymphocyte-enriched population of cells transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding a chimeric antigen 
receptor targeting human B cell maturation antigen with 4-1BB and CD3-zeta intracellular signalling 
domains, idecabtagene vicleucel, for treatment of multiple myeloma (EU/3/17/1863) is not removed 
from the Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

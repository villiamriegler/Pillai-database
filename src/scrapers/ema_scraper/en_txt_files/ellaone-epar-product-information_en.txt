Adolescents: 
ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception is suitable for any woman of child bearing age, 
including adolescents. No differences in safety or efficacy have been shown compared to adult women 
aged 18 and older (see section 5.1).  
Method of administration 
Oral use. 
The tablet can be taken with or without food. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
ellaOne is for occasional use only. It should in no instance replace a regular contraceptive method. In 
any case, women should be advised to adopt a regular method of contraception. 
Ulipristal acetate is not intended for use during pregnancy and should not be taken by any woman 
suspected or known to be pregnant. However, it does not interrupt an existing pregnancy (see section 
4.6). 
ellaOne does not prevent pregnancy in every case 
In case the next menstrual period is more than 7 days late, if the menstrual period is abnormal in 
character or if there are symptoms suggestive of pregnancy or in case of doubt, a pregnancy test 
should be performed. As with any pregnancy, the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy should be 
considered. It is important to know that the occurrence of uterine bleeding does not rule out ectopic 
pregnancy. Women who become pregnant after taking ulipristal acetate should contact their doctor 
(see section 4.6). 
ulipristal acetate inhibits or postpones ovulation (see section 5.1). If ovulation has already occurred, it 
is no longer effective. The timing of ovulation cannot be predicted and therefore the tablet should be 
taken as soon as possible after unprotected intercourse.  
No data are available on the efficacy of ulipristal acetate when taken more than 120 hours (5 days) 
after unprotected intercourse. 
Limited and inconclusive data suggest that there may be reduced efficacy of ellaOne with increasing 
body weight or body mass index (BMI) (see section 5.1). In all women, emergency contraception 
should be taken as soon as possible after unprotected intercourse, regardless of the woman’s body 
weight or BMI. 
After the tablet intake menstrual periods can sometimes occur a few days earlier or later than expected. 
In approximately 7% of the women, menstrual periods occurred more than 7 days earlier than expected. 
In 18.5% of the women a delay of more than 7 days occurred, and in 4% the delay was greater than 
20 days.  
Concomitant use of ulipristal acetate and emergency contraception containing levonorgestrel is not 
recommended (see section 4.5). 
Contraception after ellaOne intake 
Ulipristal acetate is an emergency contraceptive that decreases pregnancy risk after unprotected 
intercourse but does not confer contraceptive protection for subsequent acts of intercourse. Therefore, 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
after using emergency contraception, women should be advised to use a reliable barrier method until 
her next menstrual period. 
Although the use of ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception does not contraindicate the 
continued use of regular hormonal contraception, ellaOne may reduce its contraceptive action (see 
section 4.5). Therefore, if a woman wishes to start or continue using hormonal contraception, she can 
do so after using ellaOne, however, she should be advised to use a reliable barrier method until the 
next menstrual period. 
Specific populations 
Concomitant use of ellaOne with CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended due to interaction (e.g. 
barbiturates (including primidone and phenobarbital), phenytoin, fosphenytoin, carbamazepine, 
oxcarbazepine, herbal medicinal products containing Hypericum perforatum (St. John’s wort), 
rifampicin, rifabutin, griseofulvin, efavirenz, nevirapine and long term use of ritonavir). 
Use in women with severe asthma treated by oral glucocorticoid is not recommended. 
This medicine contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total 
lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.   
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ulipristal acetate 
Ulipristal acetate is metabolised by CYP3A4 in vitro. 
- 
CYP3A4 inducers 
In vivo results show that the administration of ulipristal acetate with a strong CYP3A4 inducer 
such as rifampicin markedly decreases Cmax and AUC of ulipristal acetate by 90% or more and 
decreases ulipristal acetate half-life by 2.2-fold corresponding to an approximately 10-fold 
decrease of ulipristal acetate exposure. Concomitant use of ellaOne with CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. 
barbiturates (including primidone and phenobarbital), phenytoin, fosphenytoin, carbamazepine, 
oxcarbazepine, herbal medicines containing Hypericum perforatum (St. John’s wort), 
rifampicin, rifabutin, griseofulvin, efavirenz and nevirapine) therefore reduces plasma 
concentrations of ulipristal acetate and may result in a decreased efficacy of ellaOne. For 
women who have used enzyme-inducing drugs in the past 4 weeks, ellaOne is not recommended 
(see section 4.4) and non-hormonal emergency contraception (i.e. a copper intrauterine device 
(Cu-IUD)) should be considered. 
- 
CYP3A4 inhibitors 
In vivo results show that administration of ulipristal acetate with a potent and a moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitor increased Cmax and AUC of ulipristal acetate with a maximum of 2- and 
5.9-fold, respectively. The effects of CYP3A4 inhibitors are unlikely to have any clinical 
consequences.   
The CYP3A4 inhibitor ritonavir can also have an inducing effect on CYP3A4 when ritonavir is 
used for a longer period. In such cases ritonavir might reduce plasma concentrations of ulipristal 
acetate. Concomitant use is therefore not recommended (see section 4.4). Enzyme induction 
wears off slowly and effects on the plasma concentrations of ulipristal acetate may occur even if 
a woman has stopped taking an enzyme inducer in the past 4 weeks. 
Medicinal products affecting gastric pH 
Administration of ulipristal acetate (10 mg tablet) together with the proton pump inhibitor 
esomeprazole (20 mg daily for 6 days) resulted in approximately 65% lower mean Cmax, a delayed Tmax 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(from a median of 0.75 hours to 1.0 hours) and 13% higher mean AUC. The clinical relevance of this 
interaction for single dose administration of ulipristal acetate as emergency contraception is not 
known. 
Potential for ulipristal acetate to affect other medicinal products 
Hormonal contraceptives 
Because ulipristal acetate binds to the progesterone receptor with high affinity, it may interfere with 
the action of progestogen-containing medicinal products: 
- 
Contraceptive action of combined hormonal contraceptives and progestogen-only contraception 
may be reduced 
Concomitant use of ulipristal acetate and emergency contraception containing levonorgestrel is 
not recommended (see section 4.4).  
- 
In vitro data indicate that ulipristal acetate and its active metabolite do not significantly inhibit 
CYP1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4, at clinically relevant concentrations. After single dose 
administration induction of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 by ulipristal acetate or its active metabolite is not 
likely. Thus, administration of ulipristal acetate is unlikely to alter the clearance of medicinal products 
that are metabolised by these enzymes.  
P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates 
In vitro data indicate that ulipristal acetate may be an inhibitor of P-gp at clinically relevant 
concentrations. Results in vivo with the P-gp substrate fexofenadine were inconclusive. The effects of 
the P-gp substrates are unlikely to have any clinical consequences.   
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy 
ellaOne is not intended for use during pregnancy and should not be taken by any woman suspected or 
known to be pregnant (see section 4.2). 
Ulipristal acetate does not interrupt an existing pregnancy. 
Pregnancy may occasionally occur after ulipristal acetate intake. Although no teratogenic potential has 
been observed, animal data are insufficient with regard to reproduction toxicity (see section 5.3). 
Limited human data regarding pregnancy exposure to ellaOne do not suggest any safety concern. 
Nevertheless it is important that any pregnancy in a woman who has taken ellaOne be reported to 
www.hra-pregnancy-registry.com. The purpose of this web-based registry is to collect safety 
information from women who have taken ellaOne during pregnancy or who become pregnant after 
ellaOne intake. All patient data collected will remain anonymous. 
Breast-feeding 
Ulipristal acetate is excreted in breast milk (see section 5.2). The effect on newborn/infants has not 
been studied. A risk to the breastfed child cannot be excluded. After intake of ulipristal acetate for 
emergency contraception, breast-feeding is not recommended for one week. During this time it is 
recommended to express and discard the breast milk in order to stimulate lactation. 
Fertility 
A rapid return of fertility is likely following treatment with ulipristal acetate for emergency 
contraception.  Women should be advised to use a reliable barrier method for all subsequent acts of 
intercourse until the next menstrual period.

4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Ulipristal acetate has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive or use machines: mild to 
moderate dizziness is common after ellaOne intake, somnolence and blurred vision are uncommon; 
disturbance in attention has been rarely reported. The patient should be informed not to drive or use 
machines if they are experiencing such symptoms (see section 4.8). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions were headache, nausea, abdominal pain and 
dysmenorrhea.

Adolescents: the safety profile observed in women less than 18 years old in studies and post-marketing 
is similar to the safety profile in adults during the phase III program (see section 4.2).  
Post-marketing experience: the adverse reactions spontaneously reported in post-marketing experience 
were similar in nature and frequency to the safety profile described during the phase III program.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
The majority of women (74.6%) in the phase III studies had their next menstrual period at the 
expected time or within ± 7 days, while 6.8% experienced menses more than 7 days earlier than 
expected and 18.5% had a delay of more than 7 days beyond the anticipated onset of menses. The 
delay was greater than 20 days in 4 % of the women.  
A minority (8.7%) of women reported intermenstrual bleeding lasting an average of 2.4 days. In a 
majority of cases (88.2%), this bleeding was reported as spotting. Among the women who received 
ellaOne in the phase III studies, only 0.4% reported heavy intermenstrual bleeding. 
In the phase III studies, 82 women entered a study more than once and therefore received more than one 
dose of ellaOne (73 women enrolled twice and 9 enrolled three times). There were no safety differences 
in these subjects in terms of incidence and severity of adverse reactions, change in duration or volume 
of menses or incidence of intermenstrual bleeding. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Experience with ulipristal acetate overdose is limited. Single doses up to 200 mg have been used in 
women without safety concern.  Such high doses were well-tolerated; however, these women had a 
shortened menstrual cycle (uterine bleeding occurring 2-3 days earlier than would be expected) and in 
some women, the duration of bleeding was prolonged, although not excessive in amount (spotting). 
There are no antidotes and further treatment should be symptomatic.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital system, emergency 
contraceptives. ATC code: G03AD02. 
Ulipristal acetate is an orally-active synthetic selective progesterone receptor modulator which acts via 
high-affinity binding to the human progesterone receptor. When used for emergency contraception the 
mechanism of action is inhibition or delay of ovulation via suppression of the luteinising hormone 
(LH) surge. Pharmacodynamic data show that even when taken immediately before ovulation is 
scheduled to occur (when LH has already started to rise), ulipristal acetate is able to postpone 
follicular rupture for at least 5 days in 78.6% of cases (p<0.005 vs. levonorgestrel and vs. placebo) 
(see table).

Ulipristal acetate also has high affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor and in vivo, in animals, 
antiglucocorticoid effects have been observed. However, in humans, no such effect has been observed 
even after repeat administration at the daily dose of 10 mg. It has minimal affinity to the androgen 
receptor and no affinity for the human estrogen or mineralocorticoid receptors. 
Results from two independent randomised controlled trials (see Table) showed the efficacy of 
ulipristal acetate to be non-inferior to that of levonorgestrel in women who presented for emergency 
contraception between 0 and 72 hours after unprotected intercourse or contraceptive failure. When the 
data from the two trials were combined via meta- analysis, the risk of pregnancy with ulipristal acetate 
was significantly reduced compared to levonorgestrel (p=0.046).

Two trials provide efficacy data on ellaOne used up to 120 hours after unprotected intercourse. In an 
open-label clinical trial, which enrolled women who presented for emergency contraception and were 
treated with ulipristal acetate between 48 and 120 hours after unprotected intercourse, a pregnancy rate 
of 2.1% (26/1241) was observed. In addition, the second comparative trial described above also 
provides data on 100 women treated with ulipristal acetate from 72 to 120 hours after unprotected 
intercourse, in whom no pregnancies were observed.   
Limited and inconclusive data from clinical trials suggest a possible trend for a reduced contraceptive 
efficacy of ulipristal acetate with high body weight or BMI (see section 4.4). The meta-analysis of the 
four clinical studies conducted with ulipristral acetate presented below excluded women who had 
further acts of unprotected intercourse.

A post-marketing observational study evaluating efficacy and safety of ellaOne in adolescents aged 17 
and younger showed no difference in the safety and efficacy profile compared to adult women aged 18 
and older. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following oral administration of a single 30 mg dose, ulipristal acetate is rapidly absorbed, with a 
peak plasma concentration of 176 ± 89 ng/ml occurring approximately 1 hour (0.5-2.0 h) after 
ingestion, and with an AUC0-∞ of 556 ± 260 ng.h/ml.  
Administration of ulipristal acetate together with a high-fat breakfast resulted in approximately 45% 
lower mean Cmax, a delayed Tmax (from a median of 0.75 hours to 3 hours) and 25% higher mean 
AUC0-∞ compared with administration in the fasted state. Similar results were obtained for the active 
mono-demethylated metabolite. 
Distribution 
Ulipristal acetate is highly bound (>98%) to plasma proteins, including albumin, alpha-l-acid 
glycoprotein, and high density lipoprotein.  
Ulipristal acetate is a lipophilic compound and is distributed in breast milk, with a mean daily 
excretion of 13.35 µg [0-24 hours], 2.16 µg [24-48 hours], 1.06 µg [48-72 hours], 0.58 µg  
[72-96 hours], and 0.31 µg [96-120 hours]. 
In vitro data indicate that ulipristal acetate may be an inhibitor of BCRP (Breast Cancer Resistance 
Protein) transporters at the intestinal level. The effects of ulipristal acetate on BCRP are unlikely to 
have any clinical consequences.   
Ulipristal acetate is not a substrate for either OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. 
Biotransformation/elimination 
Ulipristal acetate is extensively metabolised to mono-demethylated, di-demethylated and hydroxylated 
metabolites. The mono-demethylated metabolite is pharmacologically active.  In vitro data indicate 
that this is predominantly mediated by CYP3A4, and to a small extent by CYP1A2 and CYP2A6. The 
terminal half-life of ulipristal acetate in plasma following a single 30 mg dose is estimated to 32.4 ± 
6.3 hours, with a mean oral clearance (CL/F) of 76.8 ± 64.0 L/h.   
Special populations 
No pharmacokinetic studies with ulipristal acetate have been performed in females with impaired renal 
or hepatic function. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. Most findings in general toxicity studies were 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
related to its mechanism of action as a modulator of progesterone and glucocorticoid receptors, with 
antiprogesterone activity observed at exposures similar to therapeutic levels.  
Information from reproductive toxicity studies is limited due to the absence of exposure measurement 
in these studies. Ulipristal acetate has an embryolethal effect in rats, rabbits (at repeated doses above 1 
mg/kg) and in monkeys. At these repeated doses, the safety for a human embryo is unknown. At doses 
which were low enough to maintain gestation in the animal species, no teratogenic effects were 
observed. 
Carcinogenicity studies (in rats and mice) showed that ulipristal acetate is not carcinogenic.

The tablet can be taken with or without food. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
ellaOne is for occasional use only. It should in no instance replace a regular contraceptive method. In 
any case, women should be advised to adopt a regular method of contraception. 
Ulipristal acetate is not intended for use during pregnancy and should not be taken by any woman 
suspected or known to be pregnant. However, it does not interrupt an existing pregnancy (see section 
4.6). 
ellaOne does not prevent pregnancy in every case 
In case the next menstrual period is more than 7 days late, if the menstrual period is abnormal in 
character or if there are symptoms suggestive of pregnancy or in case of doubt, a pregnancy test 
should be performed. As with any pregnancy, the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy should be 
considered. It is important to know that the occurrence of uterine bleeding does not rule out ectopic 
pregnancy. Women who become pregnant after taking ulipristal acetate should contact their doctor 
(see section 4.6). 
Ulipristal acetate inhibits or postpones ovulation (see section 5.1). If ovulation has already occurred, it 
is no longer effective. The timing of ovulation cannot be predicted and therefore the tablet should be 
taken as soon as possible after unprotected intercourse.  
No data are available on the efficacy of ulipristal acetate when taken more than 120 hours (5 days) 
after unprotected intercourse. 
Limited and inconclusive data suggest that there may be reduced efficacy of ellaOne with increasing 
body weight or body mass index (BMI) (see section 5.1). In all women, emergency contraception 
should be taken as soon as possible after unprotected intercourse, regardless of the woman’s body 
weight or BMI. 
After the tablet intake menstrual periods can sometimes occur a few days earlier or later than expected. 
In approximately 7% of the women, menstrual periods occurred more than 7 days earlier than expected. 
In 18.5% of the women a delay of more than 7 days occurred, and in 4% the delay was greater than 
20 days.  
Concomitant use of ulipristal acetate and emergency contraception containing levonorgestrel is not 
recommended (see section 4.5). 
Contraception after ellaOne intake 
Ulipristal acetate is an emergency contraceptive that decreases pregnancy risk after unprotected 
intercourse but does not confer contraceptive protection for subsequent acts of intercourse. Therefore, 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
after using emergency contraception, women should be advised to use a reliable barrier method until 
her next menstrual period. 
Although the use of ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception does not contraindicate the 
continued use of regular hormonal contraception, ellaOne may reduce its contraceptive action (see 
section 4.5). Therefore, if a woman wishes to start or continue using hormonal contraception, she can 
do so after using ellaOne, however, she should be advised to use a reliable barrier method until the 
next menstrual period. 
Specific populations 
Concomitant use of ellaOne with CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended due to interaction (e.g. 
barbiturates (including primidone and phenobarbital), phenytoin, fosphenytoin, carbamazepine, 
oxcarbazepine, herbal medicinal products containing Hypericum perforatum (St. John’s wort), 
rifampicin, rifabutin, griseofulvin, efavirenz, nevirapine and long term use of ritonavir). 
Use in women with severe asthma treated by oral glucocorticoid is not recommended. 
This medicine contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total 
lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.   
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ulipristal acetate 
Ulipristal acetate is metabolised by CYP3A4 in vitro. 
- 
CYP3A4 inducers 
In vivo results show that the administration of ulipristal acetate with a strong CYP3A4 inducer 
such as rifampicin markedly decreases Cmax and AUC of ulipristal acetate by 90% or more and 
decreases ulipristal acetate half-life by 2.2-fold corresponding to an approximately 10-fold 
decrease of ulipristal acetate exposure. Concomitant use of ellaOne with CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. 
barbiturates (including primidone and phenobarbital), phenytoin, fosphenytoin, carbamazepine, 
oxcarbazepine, herbal medicines containing Hypericum perforatum (St. John’s wort), 
rifampicin, rifabutin, griseofulvin, efavirenz and nevirapine) therefore reduces plasma 
concentrations of ulipristal acetate and may result in a decreased efficacy of ellaOne. For 
women who have used enzyme-inducing drugs in the past 4 weeks, ellaOne is not recommended 
(see section 4.4) and non-hormonal emergency contraception (i.e. a copper intrauterine device 
(Cu-IUD)) should be considered. 
- 
CYP3A4 inhibitors 
In vivo results show that administration of ulipristal acetate with a potent and a moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitor increased Cmax and AUC of ulipristal acetate with a maximum of 2- and 
5.9-fold, respectively. The effects of CYP3A4 inhibitors are unlikely to have any clinical 
consequences.   
The CYP3A4 inhibitor ritonavir can also have an inducing effect on CYP3A4 when ritonavir is 
used for a longer period. In such cases ritonavir might reduce plasma concentrations of ulipristal 
acetate. Concomitant use is therefore not recommended (see section 4.4). Enzyme induction 
wears off slowly and effects on the plasma concentrations of ulipristal acetate may occur even if 
a woman has stopped taking an enzyme inducer in the past 4 weeks. 
Medicinal products affecting gastric pH 
Administration of ulipristal acetate (10 mg tablet) together with the proton pump inhibitor 
esomeprazole (20 mg daily for 6 days) resulted in approximately 65% lower mean Cmax, a delayed Tmax 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(from a median of 0.75 hours to 1.0 hours) and 13% higher mean AUC. The clinical relevance of this 
interaction for single dose administration of ulipristal acetate as emergency contraception is not 
known. 
Potential for ulipristal acetate to affect other medicinal products 
Hormonal contraceptives 
Because ulipristal acetate binds to the progesterone receptor with high affinity, it may interfere with 
the action of progestogen-containing medicinal products: 
-  Contraceptive action of combined hormonal contraceptives and progestogen-only 
contraception may be reduced 
-  Concomitant use of ulipristal acetate and emergency contraception containing levonorgestrel 
is not recommended (see section 4.4).  
In vitro data indicate that ulipristal acetate and its active metabolite do not significantly inhibit 
CYP1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4, at clinically relevant concentrations. After single dose 
administration induction of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 by ulipristal acetate or its active metabolite is not 
likely. Thus, administration of ulipristal acetate is unlikely to alter the clearance of medicinal products 
that are metabolised by these enzymes.  
P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates 
In vitro data indicate that ulipristal acetate may be an inhibitor of P-gp at clinically relevant 
concentrations. Results in vivo with the P-gp substrate fexofenadine were inconclusive. The effects of 
the P-gp substrates are unlikely to have any clinical consequences.   
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy 
ellaOne is not intended for use during pregnancy and should not be taken by any woman suspected or 
known to be pregnant (see section 4.2). 
Ulipristal acetate does not interrupt an existing pregnancy. 
Pregnancy may occasionally occur after ulipristal acetate intake. Although no teratogenic potential has 
been observed, animal data are insufficient with regard to reproduction toxicity (see section 5.3). 
Limited human data regarding pregnancy exposure to ellaOne do not suggest any safety concern. 
Nevertheless it is important that any pregnancy in a woman who has taken ellaOne be reported to 
www.hra-pregnancy-registry.com. The purpose of this web-based registry is to collect safety 
information from women who have taken ellaOne during pregnancy or who become pregnant after 
ellaOne intake. All patient data collected will remain anonymous. 
Breast-feeding 
Ulipristal acetate is excreted in breast milk (see section 5.2). The effect on newborn/infants has not 
been studied. A risk to the breastfed child cannot be excluded. After intake of ulipristal acetate for 
emergency contraception, breast-feeding is not recommended for one week. During this time it is 
recommended to express and discard the breast milk in order to stimulate lactation. 
Fertility 
A rapid return of fertility is likely following treatment with ulipristal acetate for emergency 
contraception.  Women should be advised to use a reliable barrier method for all subsequent acts of 
intercourse until the next menstrual period.

4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Ulipristal acetate has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive or use machines: mild to 
moderate dizziness is common after ellaOne intake, somnolence and blurred vision are uncommon; 
disturbance in attention has been rarely reported. The patient should be informed not to drive or use 
machines if they are experiencing such symptoms (see section 4.8). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions were headache, nausea, abdominal pain and 
dysmenorrhea. 
Safety of ulipristal acetate has been evaluated in 4,718 women during the clinical development 
program.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
The majority of women (74.6%) in the phase III studies had their next menstrual period at the 
expected time or within ± 7 days, while 6.8% experienced menses more than 7 days earlier than 
expected and 18.5% had a delay of more than 7 days beyond the anticipated onset of menses. The 
delay was greater than 20 days in 4 % of the women.  
A minority (8.7%) of women reported intermenstrual bleeding lasting an average of 2.4 days. In a 
majority of cases (88.2%), this bleeding was reported as spotting. Among the women who received 
ellaOne in the phase III studies, only 0.4% reported heavy intermenstrual bleeding. 
In the phase III studies, 82 women entered a study more than once and therefore received more than one 
dose of ellaOne (73 women enrolled twice and 9 enrolled three times). There were no safety differences 
in these subjects in terms of incidence and severity of adverse reactions, change in duration or volume 
of menses or incidence of intermenstrual bleeding. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Experience with ulipristal acetate overdose is limited. Single doses up to 200 mg have been used in 
women without safety concern.  Such high doses were well-tolerated; however, these women had a 
shortened menstrual cycle (uterine bleeding occurring 2-3 days earlier than would be expected) and in 
some women, the duration of bleeding was prolonged, although not excessive in amount (spotting). 
There are no antidotes and further treatment should be symptomatic.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital system, emergency 
contraceptives. ATC code: G03AD02. 
Ulipristal acetate is an orally-active synthetic selective progesterone receptor modulator which acts via 
high-affinity binding to the human progesterone receptor. When used for emergency contraception the 
mechanism of action is inhibition or delay of ovulation via suppression of the luteinising hormone 
(LH) surge. Pharmacodynamic data show that even when taken immediately before ovulation is 
scheduled to occur (when LH has already started to rise), ulipristal acetate is able to postpone 
follicular rupture for at least 5 days in 78.6% of cases (p<0.005 vs. levonorgestrel and vs. placebo) 
(see table).

Ulipristal acetate also has high affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor and in vivo, in animals, 
antiglucocorticoid effects have been observed. However, in humans, no such effect has been observed 
even after repeat administration at the daily dose of 10 mg. It has minimal affinity to the androgen 
receptor and no affinity for the human estrogen or mineralocorticoid receptors. 
Results from two independent randomised controlled trials (see Table) showed the efficacy of 
ulipristal acetate to be non-inferior to that of levonorgestrel in women who presented for emergency 
contraception between 0 and 72 hours after unprotected intercourse or contraceptive failure. When the 
data from the two trials were combined via meta- analysis, the risk of pregnancy with ulipristal acetate 
was significantly reduced compared to levonorgestrel (p=0.046).

Two trials provide efficacy data on ellaOne used up to 120 hours after unprotected intercourse. In an 
open-label clinical trial, which enrolled women who presented for emergency contraception and were 
treated with ulipristal acetate between 48 and 120 hours after unprotected intercourse, a pregnancy rate 
of 2.1% (26/1241) was observed. In addition, the second comparative trial described above also 
provides data on 100 women treated with ulipristal acetate from 72 to 120 hours after unprotected 
intercourse, in whom no pregnancies were observed.   
Limited and inconclusive data from clinical trials suggest a possible trend for a reduced contraceptive 
efficacy of ulipristal acetate with high body weight or BMI (see section 4.4). The meta-analysis of the 
four clinical studies conducted with ulipristral acetate presented below excluded women who had 
further acts of unprotected intercourse.

A post-marketing observational study evaluating efficacy and safety of ellaOne in adolescents aged 17 
and younger showed no difference in the safety and efficacy profile compared to adult women aged 18 
and older. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following oral administration of a single 30 mg dose, ulipristal acetate is rapidly absorbed, with a 
peak plasma concentration of 176 ± 89 ng/ml occurring approximately 1 hour (0.5-2.0 h) after 
ingestion, and with an AUC0-∞ of 556 ± 260 ng.h/ml.  
Administration of ulipristal acetate together with a high-fat breakfast resulted in approximately 45% 
lower mean Cmax, a delayed Tmax (from a median of 0.75 hours to 3 hours) and 25% higher mean 
AUC0-∞ compared with administration in the fasted state. Similar results were obtained for the active 
mono-demethylated metabolite. 
Distribution 
Ulipristal acetate is highly bound (>98%) to plasma proteins, including albumin, alpha-l-acid 
glycoprotein, and high density lipoprotein.  
Ulipristal acetate is a lipophilic compound and is distributed in breast milk, with a mean daily 
excretion of 13.35 µg [0-24 hours], 2.16 µg [24-48 hours], 1.06 µg [48-72 hours], 0.58 µg  
[72-96 hours], and 0.31 µg [96-120 hours]. 
In vitro data indicate that ulipristal acetate may be an inhibitor of BCRP (Breast Cancer Resistance 
Protein) transporters at the intestinal level. The effects of ulipristal acetate on BCRP are unlikely to 
have any clinical consequences.   
Ulipristal acetate is not a substrate for either OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. 
Biotransformation/elimination 
Ulipristal acetate is extensively metabolised to mono-demethylated, di-demethylated and hydroxylated 
metabolites. The mono-demethylated metabolite is pharmacologically active.  In vitro data indicate 
that this is predominantly mediated by CYP3A4, and to a small extent by CYP1A2 and CYP2A6. The 
terminal half-life of ulipristal acetate in plasma following a single 30 mg dose is estimated to 32.4 ± 
6.3 hours, with a mean oral clearance (CL/F) of 76.8 ± 64.0 L/h.   
Special populations 
No pharmacokinetic studies with ulipristal acetate have been performed in females with impaired renal 
or hepatic function. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. Most findings in general toxicity studies were 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
related to its mechanism of action as a modulator of progesterone and glucocorticoid receptors, with 
antiprogesterone activity observed at exposures similar to therapeutic levels.  
Information from reproductive toxicity studies is limited due to the absence of exposure measurement 
in these studies. Ulipristal acetate has an embryolethal effect in rats, rabbits (at repeated doses above 1 
mg/kg) and in monkeys. At these repeated doses, the safety for a human embryo is unknown. At doses 
which were low enough to maintain gestation in the animal species, no teratogenic effects were 
observed. 
Carcinogenicity studies (in rats and mice) showed that ulipristal acetate is not carcinogenic.

healthcare professional has told you. 
-

Contents of the pack and other information 
- Useful information about contraception 
1.  What ellaOne is and what it is used for 
ellaOne is an emergency contraceptive 
ellaOne is a contraceptive intended to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex or if your contraceptive 
method has failed. For example: 
- 
- 
- 
if you had sex without protection;  
if your or your partner’s condom tore, slipped or came off, or if you forgot to use one; 
if you did not take your contraceptive pill as recommended.  
You should take the tablet as soon as possible after sex, and within a maximum of 5 days (120 hours). 
This is because it is more effective if you take it as soon as possible after unprotected sex. 
This medicine is suitable for any woman of childbearing age, including adolescents.  
You can take the tablet at any time in the menstrual cycle. 
ellaOne does not work if you are already pregnant   
If your menstrual period is late, there is a possibility that you may be pregnant. When your period is 
late or when you have symptoms of pregnancy (heavy breasts, morning sickness) you should consult a 
doctor or other healthcare professional before taking the tablet.  
If you have unprotected sex after taking the tablet, it will not stop you from becoming pregnant. 
Unprotected sex at any time during your cycle can lead to pregnancy. 
ellaOne is not to be used for regular contraception 
If you do not have a regular method of contraception, talk to your doctor or healthcare professional to 
choose one that is suitable for you. 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
How ellaOne works 
ellaOne contains the substance ulipristal acetate which acts by modifying the activity of the natural 
hormone progesterone which is necessary for ovulation to occur. As a result, this medicine works by 
postponing ovulation. Emergency contraception is not effective in every case. Of 100 women who 
take this medicine approximately 2 will become pregnant.  
This medicine is a contraceptive used to prevent a pregnancy from starting. If you are already 
pregnant, it will not interrupt an existing pregnancy. 
Emergency contraception does not protect against sexually transmitted infections 
Only condoms can protect you from sexually transmitted infections. This medicine will not protect 
you against HIV infection or any other sexually transmitted diseases (e.g. chlamydia, genital herpes, 
genital warts, gonorrhoea, hepatitis B and syphilis). Ask a healthcare professional for advice if you are 
worried about this.  
There is more information about contraception at the end of this leaflet. 
2.  What you need to know before you take ellaOne 
Do not take ellaOne 
- 
if you are allergic to ulipristal acetate or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Warning and precautions 
Talk to your pharmacist, doctor or other healthcare professional before taking this medicine 
- 
if your period is late or you have symptoms of pregnancy (heavy breasts, morning sickness), as 
you may already be pregnant (see section “Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility”); 
if you suffer from severe asthma; 
if you suffer from severe liver disease. 
- 
- 
In all women, emergency contraception should be taken as soon as possible after unprotected 
intercourse. There is some evidence that this medicine may be less effective with increasing body 
weight or body mass index (BMI), but these data were limited and inconclusive. Therefore, ellaOne is 
still recommended for all women regardless of their weight or BMI.  
You are advised to speak to a healthcare professional if you are concerned about any problems related 
to taking emergency contraception. 
If you become pregnant despite taking the tablet, it is important that you see your doctor. See section 
“Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility” for more information.  
Other contraceptives and ellaOne 
This medicine may make regular hormonal contraceptives, like pills and patches, temporarily less 
effective. If you are currently taking hormonal contraception, continue to use it as usual after taking 
this medicine, but be sure to use condoms every time you have sex until your next period. 
Do not take this medicine together with another emergency contraceptive pill that contains 
levonorgestrel. By taking them both together, you might make this medicine less effective. 
Other medicines and ellaOne 
Tell your pharmacist, doctor or other healthcare professional if you are taking or have recently taken 
any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription or herbal medicines. 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Some medicines may prevent ellaOne from working effectively. If you have used any of the medicines 
listed below during the last 4 weeks, ellaOne may be less suitable for you. Your doctor may prescribe 
another type of (non-hormonal) emergency contraceptive, i.e. a copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD): 
- 
medicines used to treat epilepsy (for example, primidone, phenobarbital, phenytoin, 
fosphenytoine, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine and barbiturates) 
medicines used to treat tuberculosis (for example, rifampicin, rifabutin) 
a treatment for HIV (ritonavir, efavirenz, nevirapine)  
a medicine used to treat fungal infections (griseofulvin) 
herbal remedies containing St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Speak to your doctor or pharmacist before using ellaOne when you use (or have recently used) any of 
the medicines stated above. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility  
Pregnancy 
Before taking this medicine, if your period is late, tell your pharmacist, doctor or other healthcare 
professional, or do a pregnancy test in order to make sure you are not already pregnant (see section 
“Warning and precautions”).  
This medicine is a contraceptive used to prevent a pregnancy from starting. If you are already pregnant 
it will not interrupt an existing pregnancy. 
If you become pregnant despite taking this medicine, there is no evidence that it will affect your 
pregnancy. However, it is important that you see your doctor. As for any pregnancy, your doctor may 
want to check that the pregnancy is not outside the womb. This is especially important if you have 
severe abdominal (stomach) pain or bleeding or if you have previously had a pregnancy outside the 
womb, tubal surgery or long term (chronic) genital infection.  
If you become pregnant despite taking ellaOne, you are encouraged to ask your doctor to register your 
pregnancy in an official registry. You can also report this information on your own at 
www.hra-pregnancy-registry.com.Your information will remain anonymous – nobody will know it is 
information about you. Sharing your information may help women in the future understand the safety 
or risks of ellaOne during a pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
If you take this medicine while you are breast-feeding a baby, do not breast-feed for one week after 
taking this medicine. During this time, it is recommended to use a breast pump in order to maintain 
milk production, but throw away your breast milk. The effect of breast-feeding your baby in the week 
after taking this medicine is not known. 
Fertility 
This medicine will not affect your future fertility. If you have unprotected sex after taking the tablet, it 
will not stop you from becoming pregnant. Therefore it is important you use condoms until your next 
period.  
If you wish to start or continue with a regular method of contraception after using this medicine, you 
can do so but you should also use condoms until your next period. 
Driving and using machines 
After taking this medicine, some women experience dizziness, drowsiness, blurred vision and/or loss 
of concentration (see section 4). If you experience these symptoms, do not drive or use machines  
ellaOne contains lactose  
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicinal product.

USEFUL INFORMATION ABOUT CONTRACEPTION 
MORE ABOUT EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION 
The sooner you take emergency contraception, the better the chance of avoiding pregnancy.  
Emergency contraception will not affect your fertility. 
Emergency contraception can delay ovulation within a given menstrual cycle, but it will not stop you 
from becoming pregnant if you have unprotected sex again. After you take emergency contraception 
and until your next period comes, you should use a condom every time you have sex. 
MORE ABOUT REGULAR CONTRACEPTION 
If you have taken emergency contraception and you do not use a regular contraceptive method (or do 
not have a contraceptive method that suits you), talk to your doctor or family planning clinic for advice. 
44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There  are  many  different  types  of  contraception  available,  and  you  should  be  able  to  find  the  right 
method for you.

Daily methods 
  Contraceptive pill 
Weekly or monthly methods 
  Contraceptive patch

Contents of the pack and other information 
- Useful information about contraception 
1.  What ellaOne is and what it is used for 
ellaOne is an emergency contraceptive 
ellaOne is a contraceptive intended to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex or if your contraceptive 
method has failed. For example: 
- 
- 
- 
if you had sex without protection;  
if your or your partner’s condom tore, slipped or came off, or if you forgot to use one; 
if you did not take your contraceptive pill as recommended.  
You should take the tablet as soon as possible after sex, and within a maximum of 5 days (120 hours). 
This is because it is more effective if you take it as soon as possible after unprotected sex. 
This medicine is suitable for any woman of childbearing age, including adolescents.  
You can take the tablet at any time in the menstrual cycle. 
ellaOne does not work if you are already pregnant   
If your menstrual period is late, there is a possibility that you may be pregnant. When your period is 
late or when you have symptoms of pregnancy (heavy breasts, morning sickness) you should consult a 
doctor or other healthcare professional before taking the tablet.  
If you have unprotected sex after taking the tablet, it will not stop you from becoming pregnant. 
Unprotected sex at any time during your cycle can lead to pregnancy. 
ellaOne is not to be used for regular contraception 
If you do not have a regular method of contraception, talk to your doctor or healthcare professional to 
choose one that is suitable for you. 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
How ellaOne works 
ellaOne contains the substance ulipristal acetate which acts by modifying the activity of the natural 
hormone progesterone which is necessary for ovulation to occur. As a result, this medicine works by 
postponing ovulation. Emergency contraception is not effective in every case. Of 100 women who 
take this medicine approximately 2 will become pregnant.  
This medicine is a contraceptive used to prevent a pregnancy from starting. If you are already 
pregnant, it will not interrupt an existing pregnancy. 
Emergency contraception does not protect against sexually transmitted infections 
Only condoms can protect you from sexually transmitted infections. This medicine will not protect 
you against HIV infection or any other sexually transmitted diseases (e.g. chlamydia, genital herpes, 
genital warts, gonorrhoea, hepatitis B and syphilis). Ask a healthcare professional for advice if you are 
worried about this.  
There is more information about contraception at the end of this leaflet. 
2.  What you need to know before you take ellaOne 
Do not take ellaOne 
- 
if you are allergic to ulipristal acetate or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Warning and precautions 
Talk to your pharmacist, doctor or other healthcare professional before taking this medicine 
- 
if your period is late or you have symptoms of pregnancy (heavy breasts, morning sickness), as 
you may already be pregnant (see section “Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility”); 
if you suffer from severe asthma; 
if you suffer from severe liver disease. 
- 
- 
In all women, emergency contraception should be taken as soon as possible after unprotected 
intercourse. There is some evidence that this medicine may be less effective with increasing body 
weight or body mass index (BMI), but these data were limited and inconclusive. Therefore, ellaOne is 
still recommended for all women regardless of their weight or BMI.  
You are advised to speak to a healthcare professional if you are concerned about any problems related 
to taking emergency contraception. 
If you become pregnant despite taking this medicine, it is important that you see your doctor. See 
section “Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility” for more information.  
Other contraceptives and ellaOne 
This medicine may make regular hormonal contraceptives, like pills and patches, temporarily less 
effective. If you are currently taking hormonal contraception, continue to use it as usual after taking 
the tablet, but be sure to use condoms every time you have sex until your next period. 
Do not take ellaOne together with another emergency contraceptive pill that contains levonorgestrel. 
By taking them both together, you might make this medicine less effective. 
Other medicines and ellaOne 
Tell your pharmacist, doctor or other healthcare professional if you are taking or have recently taken 
any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription or herbal medicines. 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Some medicines may prevent ellaOne from working effectively. If you have used any of the medicines 
listed below during the last 4 weeks, ellaOne may be less suitable for you. Your doctor may prescribe 
another type of (non-hormonal) emergency contraceptive, i.e. a copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD): 
- 
medicines used to treat epilepsy (for example, primidone, phenobarbital, phenytoin, 
fosphenytoine, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine and barbiturates) 
medicines used to treat tuberculosis (for example, rifampicin, rifabutin) 
a treatment for HIV (ritonavir, efavirenz, nevirapine)  
a medicine used to treat fungal infections (griseofulvin) 
herbal remedies containing St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Speak to your doctor or pharmacist before using ellaOne when you use (or have recently used) any of 
the medicines stated above. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility  
Pregnancy 
Before taking this medicine, if your period is late, tell your pharmacist, doctor or other healthcare 
professional, or do a pregnancy test in order to make sure you are not already pregnant (see section 
“Warning and precautions”).  
This medicine is a contraceptive used to prevent a pregnancy from starting. If you are already pregnant 
it will not interrupt an existing pregnancy. 
If you become pregnant despite taking this medicine, there is no evidence that it will affect your 
pregnancy. However, it is important that you see your doctor. As for any pregnancy, your doctor may 
want to check that the pregnancy is not outside the womb. This is especially important if you have 
severe abdominal (stomach) pain or bleeding or if you have previously had a pregnancy outside the 
womb, tubal surgery or long term (chronic) genital infection.  
If you become pregnant despite taking ellaOne, you are encouraged to ask your doctor to register your 
pregnancy in an official registry. You can also report this information on your own at 
www.hra-pregnancy-registry.com.Your information will remain anonymous – nobody will know it is 
information about you. Sharing your information may help women in the future understand the safety 
or risks of ellaOne during a pregnancy.

taking this medicine. During this time, it is recommended to use a breast pump in order to maintain 
milk production, but throw away your breast milk. The effect of breast-feeding your baby in the week 
after taking this medicine is not known. 
Fertility 
This medicine will not affect your future fertility. If you have unprotected sex after taking this 
medicine, it will not stop you from becoming pregnant. Therefore it is important you use condoms 
until your next period.  
If you wish to start or continue with a regular method of contraception after using this medicine, you 
can do so but you should also use condoms until your next period.

After taking this medicine, some women experience dizziness, drowsiness, blurred vision and/or loss 
of concentration (see section 4). If you experience these symptoms, do not drive or use machines

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Replacement therapy in adults, children and adolescents (0-18 years) in: 
− 
Primary immunodeficiency syndromes with impaired antibody production (see section 4.4). 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
− 
Secondary immunodeficiencies (SID) in patients who suffer from severe or recurrent infections, 
ineffective antimicrobial treatment and either proven specific antibody failure (PSAF)* or 
serum IgG level of < 4 g/l. 
*PSAF = failure to mount at least a 2-fold rise in IgG antibody titre to pneumococcal polysaccharide 
and polypeptide antigen vaccines. 
Immunomodulatory therapy in adults, children and adolescents (0-18 years): 
− 
Hizentra is indicated for the treatment of patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating 
polyneuropathy (CIDP) as maintenance therapy after stabilization with IVIg. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
The dose and dose regimen are dependent on the indication. 
Therapy should be initiated and monitored under the supervision of a healthcare professional 
experienced in the treatment of immunodeficiency/CIDP with SCIg. 
Posology 
Adults and children (0-18 years) 
Replacement therapy 
The medicinal product should be administered via the subcutaneous route. 
In replacement therapy the dose may need to be individualised for each patient dependent on the 
clinical response and serum IgG trough levels. The following dose regimens are given as a guideline. 
The dose regimen should achieve a trough IgG level (measured before the next infusion) of at least 
6 g/l or within the normal reference range for the population age. A loading dose of at least 0.2 to 
0.5 g/kg (1.0 to 2.5 ml/kg) body weight may be required. This may need to be divided over several 
days. After steady state IgG levels have been attained, maintenance doses are administered at repeated 
intervals to reach a cumulative monthly dose of the order of 0.4 to 0.8 g/kg (2.0 to 4.0 ml/kg) body 
weight. Each single dose may need to be injected at different anatomic sites. 
Trough levels should be measured and assessed in conjunction with the patient’s clinical response. 
Depending on the clinical response (e.g. infection rate), adjustment of the dose and/or the dose interval 
may be considered in order to aim for higher trough levels. 
Immunomodulatory therapy in CIDP 
The therapy with Hizentra is initiated 1 week after the last IVIg infusion. The recommended 
subcutaneous dose is 0.2 to 0.4 g/kg body weight per week administered in 1 or 2 sessions over 1 or 2 
consecutive days. The initial subcutaneous dose may be a 1:1 conversion from the previous IVIG dose 
(calculated as weekly dose).  
Example a 1g/kg IVIG dose given every 3 weeks would convert into a 0.33g/kg weekly Hizentra dose. 
The weekly dose can be divided into smaller doses and administered by desired number of times per 
week. For dosing every two weeks, double the weekly Hizentra dose. 
The dose may need to be adapted to achieve the desired clinical response. Patient`s individual clinical 
response should be the primary consideration in dose adjustment. In case of clinical deterioration the 
dose may be increased to the recommended maximum of 0.4g/kg weekly dose.  
Hizentra maintenance therapy in CIDP has not been studied for periods longer than 18 months. 
Individualize the duration of any treatment beyond 18 months based upon the patient’s response and 
demonstrated need for continued therapy. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Efficacy of Hizentra has been demonstrated over placebo after switching from intravenous 
immunoglobulins (IVIG). Direct comparative data for Hizentra versus IVIG are not available. Please 
refer also to section 5.1. 
Paediatric population 
The posology in children and adolescents (0-18 years) is not different to that of adults as the posology 
for each indication is given by body weight and adjusted to the clinical outcome in replacement 
therapy indications. 
Hizentra was evaluated in 68 paediatric subjects with PID aged 2 to <12 years and in 57 adolescents 
aged 12 to  <18 years. No paediatric-specific dose requirements were necessary to achieve the desired 
serum IgG levels. Hizentra has not been evaluated in clinical studies in paediatric patients with CIDP 
who are under the age of 18. 
Elderly  
As the dose is given by body weight and adjusted to the clinical outcome of the above mentioned 
conditions, the dose in elderly is not considered to be different from that in subjects 18 to 65 years of 
age. 
In clinical studies Hizentra was evaluated in 13 subjects with PID >65 years of age and no specific 
dose adjustments were necessary to achieve the desired serum IgG levels. 
In clinical studies Hizentra was evaluated in 61 subjects with CIDP >65 years of age and no specific 
dose adjustments were necessary to achieve the desired clinical outcome. 
Method of administration 
For subcutaneous use only. 
Home-treatment 
Subcutaneous infusion for home treatment must be initiated and monitored by a healthcare 
professional experienced in the guidance of patients for home treatment. The healthcare professional 
must select the appropriate way of infusion (device-assisted or manual push infusion), based on 
patient`s individual medical situation and preferences. Infusion devices appropriate for subcutaneous 
administration of immunoglobulins can be used. The patient or a caregiver must be instructed and 
trained in the use of infusion devices, the keeping of treatment diary, recognition of and measures to 
be taken in case of severe adverse reactions. 
Hizentra may be infused into sites such as abdomen, thigh, upper arm, and / or lateral hip. 
More than one infusion device can be used simultaneously. The amount of product infused into a 
particular site may vary. In infants and children, infusion site may be changed every 5-15 ml. In adults 
doses may be given up to 50 ml/site. There is no limit to the number of infusion sites. Infusion sites 
should be at least 5 cm apart. 
Infusion rate 
Hizentra can be infused using: 
• 
an infusion device, or 
•  by manual push with a syringe. 
The recommended initial infusion rate depends on the individual patient’s needs. 
Device-assisted infusion 
The initial infusion rate should not exceed 20 ml/hour/site. 
If well-tolerated (see also section 4.4), the infusion rate can then gradually be increased to 
35 ml/hour/site for the subsequent two infusions. Thereafter, if the patient tolerates the initial infusions 
at the full dose per site and maximum rate, an increase in the infusion rate of successive infusions may 
be considered at the discretion of the patient and based on the healthcare professionals’ judgement. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Manual push infusion 
The recommended initial infusion rate should not exceed 0.5 ml/min/site (30 ml/hour/site). 
If well-tolerated (see also section 4.4), the infusion rate can be increased up to 2.0 ml/min/site 
(120 ml/hour/site). Thereafter, if the patient tolerates the initial infusions at the full dose per site and 
maximum rate, an increase in the infusion rate of successive infusions may be considered at the 
discretion of the patient and based on the healthcare professionals’ judgement. 
A 24 or larger (i.e. lower gauge number) needle gauge may be required to allow patients to infuse at 
higher flow rates. Using smaller needles (i.e. higher gauge number) may make it more difficult to 
manually push Hizentra. Only one infusion site per syringe can be infused. If administration with an 
additional Hizentra syringe is required, a new sterile injection needle should be used and the infusion 
site changed. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 (see section 
4.4). 
Patients with hyperprolinaemia type I or II. 
Hizentra must not be given intravascularly. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Hizentra is for subcutaneous use only. If Hizentra is accidentally administered into a blood vessel, 
patients could develop shock. 
The recommended infusion rate given under section 4.2 should be adhered to. Patients should be 
closely monitored and carefully observed for any adverse events throughout the infusion period. 
Certain adverse reactions may occur more frequently in patients who receive human normal 
immunoglobulin for the first time or, in rare cases, when the human normal immunoglobulin product 
is switched or when treatment has been stopped for more than eight weeks. 
− 
Potential complications can often be avoided by ensuring that patients: 
− 
are not sensitive to human normal immunoglobulin, by initially injecting the product slowly 
(see section 4.2); 
are carefully monitored for any symptoms throughout the infusion period. In particular, patients 
naïve to human normal immunoglobulin, patients switched from an alternative product or when 
there has been a long interval since the previous infusion should be monitored during the first 
infusion and for the first hour after the first infusion, in order to detect potential adverse 
reactions. 
All other patients should be observed for at least 20 minutes after administration. 
Suspicion of allergic or anaphylactic type reactions requires immediate discontinuation of the 
injection. In case of shock, standard medical treatment should be administered. 
Hypersensitivity 
True allergic reactions are rare. They can particularly occur in patients with anti-IgA antibodies who 
should be treated with particular caution. Patients with anti-IgA antibodies, in whom treatment with 
subcutaneous IgG products remains the only option, should be switched to Hizentra only under close 
medical supervision. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rarely, human normal immunoglobulin can induce a fall in blood pressure with anaphylactic reaction, 
even in patients who had tolerated previous treatment with human normal immunoglobulin. 
Thromboembolism 
Arterial and venous thromboembolic events including myocardial infarction, stroke, deep venous 
thrombosis and pulmonary embolism have been associated with the use of immunoglobulins. Caution 
should be exercised in patients with pre-existing risk factors for thrombotic events (such as advanced 
age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and a history of vascular disease or thrombotic episodes, patients 
with acquired or inherited thrombophilic disorders, patients with prolonged periods of immobilization, 
severely hypovolemic patients, patients with diseases which increase blood viscosity). Patients should 
be informed about first symptoms of thromboembolic events including shortness of breath, pain and 
swelling of a limb, focal neurological deficits and chest pain and should be advised to contact their 
physician immediately upon onset of symptoms. Patients should be sufficiently hydrated before use of 
immunoglobulins. 
Aseptic Meningitis Syndrome (AMS) 
AMS has been reported with use of IVIg or SCIg. The syndrome usually begins within several hours 
to 2 days following immune globulin treatment. AMS is characterised by the following signs and 
symptoms: severe headache, neck stiffness, drowsiness, fever, photophobia, nausea, and vomiting. 
Patients exhibiting signs and symptoms of AMS should receive a thorough neurological examination, 
including CSF studies, to rule out other causes of meningitis. Discontinuation of immunoglobulin 
treatment may result in remission of AMS within several days without sequelae. 
Information on safety with respect to transmissible agents 
Standard measures to prevent infections resulting from the use of medicinal products prepared from 
human blood or plasma include selection of donors, screening of individual donations and plasma 
pools for specific markers of infection and the inclusion of effective manufacturing steps for the 
inactivation/removal of viruses. Despite this, when medicinal products prepared from human blood or 
plasma are administered, the possibility of transmitting infective agents cannot be totally excluded. 
This also applies to unknown or emerging viruses and other pathogens. 
The measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as HIV, HBV and HCV and 
for the non-enveloped viruses HAV and parvovirus B19. 
There is reassuring clinical experience regarding the lack of hepatitis A or parvovirus B19 
transmission with immunoglobulins and it is also assumed that the antibody content makes an 
important contribution to the viral safety. 
Interference with serological testing 
After infusion of immunoglobulin the transitory rise of the various passively transferred antibodies in 
the patient's blood may result in misleading positive results in serological testing. 
Passive transmission of antibodies to erythrocyte antigens, e.g. A, B, D may interfere with some 
serological tests for red cell allo-antibodies (Coombs’ test). 
Sodium content 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial/syringe, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
Paediatric population 
The same warnings and precautions apply to the paediatric population. 
Elderly  
The same warnings and precautions apply to the elderly.

4.5 
Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Live attenuated virus vaccines 
Immunoglobulin administration may impair for a period of at least 6 weeks and up to 3 months the 
efficacy of live attenuated virus vaccines such as measles, rubella, mumps and varicella. After 
administration of this medicinal product, an interval of 3 months should elapse before vaccination with 
live attenuated virus vaccines. In the case of measles, this impairment may persist for up to 1 year. 
Therefore patients receiving measles vaccine should have their antibody status checked. 
Paediatric population 
The same interactions may occur in the paediatric population. 
Elderly  
The same interactions may occur in the elderly. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Data from prospective clinical trials on the use of human normal immunoglobulin in pregnant women 
is limited. Therefore, Hizentra should only be given with caution to pregnant women. Clinical 
experience with immunoglobulins suggests that no harmful effects on the course of pregnancy, or on 
the foetus or the neonate are to be expected. 
Continued treatment of the pregnant woman ensures a passive immunity for the neonate. 
Breast-feeding 
Data from prospective clinical trials on the use of human normal immunoglobulin in breast feeding 
women is limited. Therefore, Hizentra should only be given with caution to breast-feeding mothers. 
Clinical experience with immunoglobulins suggests however that no harmful effects on the neonate 
are to be expected. Immunoglobulins are excreted into the milk and may contribute to the transfer of 
protective antibodies to the neonate. 
Fertility 
Clinical experience with immunoglobulins suggests that no harmful effects on fertility are to be 
expected. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Hizentra has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines, e.g. dizziness (see section 4.8). 
Patients who experience adverse reactions during treatment should wait for these to resolve before 
driving or operating machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile 
Adverse reactions such as chills, headache, fever, vomiting, allergic reactions, nausea, arthralgia, low 
blood pressure and moderate low back pain may occur occasionally. 
Rarely human normal immunoglobulins may cause a sudden fall in blood pressure and in isolated 
cases, anaphylactic shock, even when the patient has shown no hypersensitivity to previous 
administration. 
Local reactions at infusion sites: swelling, soreness, redness, induration, local heat, itching, bruising 
and rash. 
For safety with respect to transmissible agents, see section 4.4.

Hizentra was not evaluated in clinical studies in paediatric patients with CIDP who were under the age 
of 18. 
Elderly  
The same adverse reactions may occur in the elderly. Information available from clinical trials showed 
no difference in the safety profile of patients ≥ 65 years of age than of younger patients. 
Postmarketing experience with Hizentra in patients ≥ 65 years of age shows an overall similar safety 
profile in this age group as in younger patients. 
Please refer to section 4.4 for details on risk factors and monitoring recommendations. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. 
Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Consequences of an overdose are not known.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: immune sera and immunoglobulins: immunoglobulins, normal human, 
for extravascular administration, ATC code: J06BA01. 
Human normal immunoglobulin contains mainly immunoglobulin G (IgG) with a broad spectrum of 
antibodies against infectious agents. 
Human normal immunoglobulin contains the IgG antibodies present in the normal population. It is 
usually prepared from pooled plasma from not fewer than 1,000 donors. It has a distribution of 
immunoglobulin G subclasses closely proportional to that in native human plasma.  
Mechanism of action 
In immunodeficiency, adequate doses of Hizentra may restore abnormally low immunoglobulin G 
antibody levels to the normal range and thus help against infections. 
The mechanism of action in indications other than replacement therapy is not fully elucidated, but 
includes immunomodulatory effects. 
PID 
In the European pivotal prospective open label, single arm and multicentre study, a total of 51 subjects 
with primary immunodeficiency syndromes aged between 3 and 60 years old were treated with 
Hizentra for up to 41 weeks. The mean dose administered each week was 0.12 g/kg body weight (bw). 
Sustained IgG trough levels with mean concentrations of 7.99 – 8.25 g/l were thereby achieved 
throughout the treatment period. Subjects received in total 1,831 weekly Hizentra infusions. 
In the US prospective open label, single arm and multicentre study, a total of 49 subjects with primary 
immunodeficiency syndromes aged between 5 and 72 years old were treated with Hizentra for up to 
15 months. The mean dose administered each week was 0.23 g/kg bw. Sustained IgG trough levels 
with a mean concentration of 12.53 g/l were thereby achieved throughout the treatment period. 
Subjects received in total 2,264 weekly Hizentra infusions. 
No serious bacterial infections were reported during the efficacy period in subjects receiving Hizentra 
during clinical studies. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To assess the safety and tolerability of higher infusion rates applied via the manual push and pump-
assisted administration, 49 PID subjects aged 2 to 75 years were enrolled in an open-label, multicentre, 
parallel-arm, nonrandomised phase IV HILO (Hizentra Label Optimization) study and treated with 
Hizentra for at least 12 weeks (11 paediatric patients aged 2 to <18, 35 adult patients aged 18 to 65, 
and 3 geriatric patients aged >65 years). In the first patient group receiving Hizentra via the manual 
push technique (n=16), 2 to 7 infusions per week were administered with the flow rates of 30, 60 and 
120 ml/hour/site (see section 4.2). In the second patient group receiving Hizentra via pump-assisted 
administration (n=18), weekly Hizentra infusions were administered with 25, 50, 75 and 100 
ml/hour/site flow rate. In a third group, infusion volumes of 25, 40 and 50ml per site were additionally 
evaluated in pump-assisted administration of weekly Hizentra doses (n=15). In all three groups, each 
infusion parameter was used for 4 weeks, after which subjects successfully completing required 
minimal number of valid infusions could switch to the next higher infusion parameter. 
The primary endpoint was the percentage of subjects responding to a higher infusion parameter:

Responder: in the pump-assisted group a subject who performed ≥3 valid infusions out of 4 for an infusion 
parameter; in the manual push group a subject who performed ≥60 % of valid infusions for an infusion 
parameter. An infusion was considered valid, if ≥95 % of the planned flow rate/volume per ≥1 infusion site 
was achieved. 
Overall, the number of infusions without severe local reactions versus the total number of infusions 
(tolerability) was ≥ 0.98 in all groups for all infusion parameters. No clinically relevant differences in 
the serum IgG trough concentrations were observed between the baseline at day 1 and the end of the 
study in all subjects. 
CIDP 
The safety, efficacy and tolerability of Hizentra in patients with CIDP has been assessed in a 
multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase III PATH 
[Polyneuropathy and Treatment with Hizentra] study. 172 adults with definite or probable CIDP who 
were previously treated with and responded to IVIg were randomised to weekly 0.2 g/kg bw Hizentra, 
weekly 0.4 g/kg bw Hizentra or placebo groups, and followed for a subsequent 24 weeks. The mean 
duration of exposure was 118.9 days in the 0.2 g/kg bw and 129 days in the 0.4 g/kg bw Hizentra 
group (maximum exposure up to 167 and 166 days in each group, respectively). Subjects generally 
used 4 infusion sites in parallel (up to 8 sites in parallel). In total, 57 subjects received 1514 infusions 
in the placebo group, 57 subjects received 2007 infusions in the 0.2 g/kg bw Hizentra group, and 58 
subjects received 2218 infusions in the 0.4 g/kg bw Hizentra group (in total 5739 infusions). 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of subjects who had a CIDP relapse (defined as a ≥ 
1 point increase in adjusted Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment [INCAT] score compared 
with baseline) or were withdrawn for any other reason in the Hizentra treatment period. 
Both Hizentra doses demonstrated superiority over placebo for the primary endpoint. A statistically 
significant lower percentage of subjects treated with Hizentra, 32.8 % for 0.4 g/kg bw and 38.6 % for 
0.2 g/kg bw, had CIDP relapse or was withdrawn for other reasons compared with 63.2 % subjects 
treated with placebo (p < 0.001 or p = 0.007, respectively). When only considering relapse, the CIDP 
relapse rates were 19.0 % for 0.4 g/kg bw Hizentra and 33.3 % for 0.2 g/kg bw Hizentra compared 
with 56.1 % for placebo (p < 0.001 or p = 0.012, respectively). Accordingly, over the treatment period 
for up to 24 weeks Hizentra prevented relapse in 81 % and 67 % of subjects in the 0.4 g/kg bw and 0.2 
g/kg bw group, respectively, while in the placebo group 44 % of subjects remained relapse-free. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
Time to CIDP relapse (Figure 1) was evaluated, and the corresponding probabilities for CIDP relapse 
based on Kaplan-Meier estimates were: placebo, 58.8 %; 0.2 /kg bw Hizentra, 35.0 %; and 0.4 g/kg 
bw Hizentra, 22.4 %. The hazard ratios (95 % CI) for the lower dose and higher dose compared to 
placebo was 0.48 (0.27, 0.85) and 0.25 (0.12, 0.49), respectively. 
The difference observed between the 0.2 g/kg bw and the 0.4 g/kg bw Hizentra groups did not reach 
statistical significance. 
Figure 1. Kaplan-Meier Plot Time to CIDP Relapse 
In the efficacy scores (INCAT score, mean grip strength, and Medical Research Council sum score), 
subjects in both Hizentra dose groups remained stable while subjects in the placebo group 
deteriorated. Subjects in the high dose Hizentra group remained stable in the Rasch-built Overall 
Disability Scale (R-ODS) centile score. Subjects in both Hizentra dose groups remained stable in 
electrophysiology parameters. 
A phase III, multicentre, 48-week open-label extension study enrolled 82 CIDP patients from the 
PATH study. The extension study investigated the long-term safety and efficacy of Hizentra 
maintenance therapy in the two weekly doses, 0.2 g/kg and 0.4 g/kg bw. Due to the study design, the 
same subject could receive both doses during the study; 72 subjects received doses of 0.4 g/kg and 73 
subjects received doses of 0.2 g/kg during the efficacy evaluation period. The mean efficacy 
evaluation period was 125.8 days (range: 1-330) in the 0.2 g/kg, and 196.1 days (range: 1-330) in the 
0.4 g/kg bw group. Patients who completed the pivotal PATH study without relapse on 0.4 g/kg bw 
dose and initially received this dose in the extension study had a relapse rate of 5.6 % (1/18 patients). 
For all patients who received 0.4 g/kg bw in the PATH extension study, 9.7 % (7/72 patients) had a 
relapse. Patients who completed the PATH study without relapse on 0.2 g/kg bw dose and initially 
received this dose in the extension study had a relapse rate of 50 % (3/6 patients). For all patients who 
received 0.2 g/kg bw in the extension study, 47.9 % (35/73 patients) had a relapse. Down-titrating 
patients in the extension study who completed the PATH study on either dose from 0.4 g/kg to 0.2 
g/kg bw dose was possible in 67.9 % of subjects (19/28 patients) without occurrence of relapse; all of 
the 9 relapsers recovered within 4 weeks after treatment with 0.4 g/kg bw dose. Grip strength, MRC

sum score, and R-ODS centile score remained stable as compared to baseline for patients who never 
had a relapse in the extension study. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and effectiveness of Hizentra have been established in paediatric subjects 2 to 18 years of 
age. Hizentra was evaluated in 68 paediatric subjects with PID 2 to <12 years of age and in 57 
paediatric subjects 12 to <18 years of age. There were no differences in the pharmacokinetics, safety 
and efficacy profiles as compared with adult subjects. No paediatric-specific dose adjustments were 
necessary to achieve the desired serum IgG levels. No differences were seen in the pharmacodynamic 
properties between adult and paediatric study patients with PID.  
Hizentra has not been evaluated in clinical studies in paediatric patients with CIDP who are under the 
age of 18. 
Elderly  
No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between PID subjects >65 years and PID 
subjects 18 to 65 years of age.  In the clinical studies Hizentra was evaluated in 13 patients with PID 
>65 years of age. 
No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between CIDP subjects >65 years and CIDP 
subjects 18 to 65 years of age. In the clinical studies with CIDP patients, 61 subjects >65 years of age 
were treated with Hizentra. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption and Distribution 
Following subcutaneous administration of Hizentra, peak serum levels are achieved after 
approximately 2 days. 
Elimination 
IgG and IgG-complexes are broken down in cells of the reticuloendothelial system. 
PID 
In a clinical phase III trial with Hizentra (n = 46), the subjects achieved sustained trough levels 
(median 8.1 g/l) over a period of 29 weeks when receiving median weekly doses of 0.06 to 
0.24 g/kgbw. 
Simulations by empirical Population Pharmacokinetic models suggested that comparable IgG 
exposure levels (AUC0-14days, Cmin 14days) may be obtained if Hizentra is administered subcutaneously 
every two weeks using double the weekly dose during maintenance therapy. 
These simulations further suggested that comparable serum IgG trough levels can be achieved when 
the weekly maintenance dose of Hizentra is administered in proportional amounts more frequently 
than once a week (e.g. 2 times per week, 3 times per week, 5 times per week or daily). 
Simulation of 2-3 missed daily doses resulted in a median serum IgG level decrease of ≤ 4% compared 
to consistent daily dosing. By replacing the missed doses when daily dosing was resumed, the median 
concentration profile recovered within 2 to 3 days. However, if missed doses were not replaced when 
dosing was resumed, it took up to 5-6 weeks for the IgG trough levels to return to steady-state. 
Paediatric population 
No differences were seen in the pharmacokinetic parameters between adult and paediatric PID study 
patients. 
Elderly  
No overall differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters were observed between PID subjects >65 
years and subjects 18 to 65 years of age. 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CIDP 
In the PATH study, subjects (n = 172) achieved sustained trough levels over a period of 24 weeks 
when receiving weekly doses of 0.2 g/kg bw and 0.4 g/kg bw, respectively. The mean (SD) IgG trough 
concentration after Hizentra treatment in the 0.4 g/kg bw group was 20.4 (3.24) g/l and 15.4 (3.06) g/l 
in the 0.2 g/kg bw group. Simulations with population-pharmacokinetic models in the PATH study 
suggest that a comparable IgG exposure (Cmax, AUC0-14days, Cmin, 14 days) is achieved when the 
double weekly Hizentra dose is administered every two weeks in the CIDP subjects. These simulations 
further suggest that a comparable IgG exposure is correspondingly achieved when the weekly 
maintenance dose of Hizentra is divided in several, more frequent doses (2 to 7 times per week) in the 
CIDP patients` population. 
Paediatric population 
Hizentra has not been evaluated in clinical studies in paediatric patients with CIDP who are under the 
age of 18. 
Elderly  
No overall differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters were observed between CIDP subjects >65 
years and subjects 18 to 65 years of age. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Immunoglobulins are a normal constituent of the human body. L-proline is a physiological, non-
essential amino acid. 
The safety of Hizentra has been assessed in several preclinical studies, with particular reference to the 
excipient L-proline. Non-clinical data reveal no special risk for humans based on safety pharmacology 
and toxicity studies.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Hizentra is and what it is used for 
What Hizentra is 
Hizentra belongs to the class of medicines called human normal immunoglobulins. Immunoglobulins 
are also known as antibodies and are blood proteins that help your body to fight infections. 
How Hizentra works 
Hizentra contains immunoglobulins that have been prepared from the blood of healthy people. 
Immunoglobulins are produced by human body’s immune system. They help your body to fight 
infections caused by bacteria and viruses or maintain the balance in your immune system (referred to 
as immunomodulation). The medicine works in exactly the same way as the immunoglobulins 
naturally present in your blood. 
What Hizentra is used for 
Replacement therapy 
Hizentra is used to raise abnormally low immunoglobulin levels in your blood to normal levels 
(replacement therapy). The medicine is used in adults and children (0-18 years) in the following 
situations: 
1. 
Treatment of patients who are born with a reduced ability or inability to produce 
immunoglobulins (primary immunodeficiencies). This includes conditions such as: 
• 
low immunoglobulin levels (hypogammaglobulinaemia) or absence of immunoglobulins 
(agammaglobulinaemia) in the blood 
combination of low immunoglobulin levels, frequent infections and inability to produce 
adequate amounts of antibodies after vaccination (common variable immunodeficiency) 
combination of low level or absence of immunoglobulins and absence or non-functional 
immune cells (severe combined immunodeficiency) 
lack of certain immunoglobulin G subclasses causing recurrent infections. 
• 
• 
• 
2. 
Treatment of patients with low or dysfunctional immunoglobulin levels in acquired conditions 
(secondary immunodeficiency) who experience severe or recurrent infections due to a weakened 
immune system resulting from other conditions or treatments. 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Immunomodulatory therapy in CIDP patients 
Hizentra is also used in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), a 
form of autoimmune disease. CIDP is characterised by chronic inflammation of the peripheral nerves 
that causes muscle weakness and/or numbness mainly in the legs and arms. It is believed that the 
body’s defense attack underlines such inflammation, and the immunoglobulins present in Hizentra 
help to protect the nerves from being attacked (immunomodulatory therapy). 
2.  What you need to know before you use Hizentra 
Do NOT infuse Hizentra 
► 
if you are allergic to human immunoglobulins, polysorbate 80 or L-proline. 
 
Tell your doctor or healthcare professional prior to treatment if you have experienced an 
intolerance against one of these components earlier. 
► 
► 
if you suffer from hyperprolinaemia (a genetic disorder causing high levels of the amino acid 
proline in the blood). 
into a blood vessel. 
Warnings and precautions 
 
Talk to your doctor or healthcare professional before using Hizentra. 
You may be allergic (hypersensitive) to immunoglobulins without knowing it. However, true allergic 
reactions are rare. They may occur even if you received human immunoglobulins previously and 
tolerated them well. It may happen particularly if you do not have enough of the immunoglobulin type 
A (IgA) in your blood (IgA deficiency). 
 
Tell your doctor or healthcare professional prior to treatment if you have an immunoglobulin 
type A (IgA) deficiency. Hizentra contains residual amounts of IgA which might cause an 
allergic reaction. 
In these rare cases allergic reactions, such as a sudden fall in blood pressure or shock may occur (see 
also section 4 “Possible side effects”). 
 
If you notice such signs during the infusion of Hizentra, stop the infusion and contact your 
doctor or go to the nearest hospital immediately.  
Tell your doctor if you have a history of heart or blood vessel disease or blood clots, have thick 
 
blood, or have been immobile for some time. These things may increase your risk of having a blood 
clot after using Hizentra. Also tell your doctor what drugs you are using, as some drugs, such as those 
that contain the hormone estrogen (for example, birth control pills), may increase your risk of 
developing a blood clot. Contact your doctor immediately if you experience signs and symptoms such 
as shortness of breath, chest pain, pain and swelling of a limb, weakness or numbness on one side of 
the body after receiving Hizentra. 
  Contact your doctor if you experience the following signs and symptoms: severe headache, neck 
stiffness, drowsiness, fever, photophobia, nausea, and vomiting after receiving Hizentra. Your doctor 
will decide if further tests are necessary and whether Hizentra should be continued. 
► 
Your healthcare professional will avoid potential complications by ensuring: 
► 
that you are not sensitive to human normal immunoglobulin. 
The medicine must be infused slowly at first. The recommended infusion rate given under 
section 3 “How to use Hizentra” must be closely followed. 
that you are carefully monitored for any symptoms throughout the infusion period, especially if: 
• 
you receive human normal immunoglobulin for the first time 
• 
you have switched from a different medicine 
• 
there has been a long interval (more than eight weeks) since the previous infusion. 
In these cases, it is recommended that you are monitored during the first infusion and for an 
hour afterwards. If the points above do not apply for you it is recommended that you are 
observed for at least 20 minutes after administration. 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other medicines and Hizentra 
 
Tell your doctor or healthcare professional if you are using, have recently used or might use any 
other medicines. 
  You must not mix other medicines with Hizentra. 
 
Tell your vaccinating doctor prior to a vaccination about your treatment with Hizentra. 
Hizentra may impair the effect of some live virus vaccines such as measles, rubella, mumps and 
chicken pox. Therefore, after receiving this medicine you may have to wait up to 3 months 
before receiving your live-attenuated vaccine. In the case of measles vaccinations the 
impairment may persist for up to 1 year. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
 
Tell your doctor or healthcare professional if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant or are 
breast-feeding. Your doctor will decide whether you can receive Hizentra during your 
pregnancy or while you are breast-feeding. 
No clinical studies have been performed with Hizentra in pregnant women. However, medicines that 
contain immunoglobulins have been used in pregnant or breast-feeding women for years, and no 
harmful effects on the course of pregnancy or on the baby have been observed. 
If you are breast-feeding and receive Hizentra, the immunoglobulins of the medicine can also be found 
in the breast milk. Therefore, your baby may be protected from certain infections. 
Driving and using machines 
Patients may experience effects, such as dizziness or nausea, during treatment with Hizentra that might 
affect the ability to drive and use machines. If this happens, you should not drive or use machines until 
these effects have disappeared. 
Hizentra contains proline 
You must not take it if you suffer from hyperprolinaemia (see also section 2 “What you need to know 
before you use Hizentra”). Please tell your doctor prior to treatment. 
Other important information about Hizentra 
Blood tests 
After receiving Hizentra, the results of certain blood tests (serological tests) may be impaired for a 
certain time. 
 
Tell your doctor about your treatment with Hizentra prior to any blood test. 
Information on what Hizentra is made of 
Hizentra is made from human blood plasma (this is the liquid part of the blood). When medicines are 
made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put in place to prevent infections being 
passed on to patients. These include: 
• 
careful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections 
are excluded, and 
the testing of each donation and pools of plasma for signs of virus/infections. 
• 
Manufacturers of these medicines also include steps in the processing of the blood or plasma that can 
inactivate or remove viruses. Despite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or 
plasma are administered, the possibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. This also 
applies to any unknown or emerging viruses or other types of infections. 
The measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV, the AIDS virus), hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus (liver inflammation), and for the 
non-enveloped hepatitis A virus and parvovirus B19. 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is strongly recommended that every time you receive a dose of Hizentra the name and batch 
number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used  (see 
section 3 “How to use Hizentra”). 
Hizentra contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial/syringe, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to use Hizentra 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. 
Dosage 
Your doctor will calculate the correct dose for you taking into account your weight and response to 
treatment. 
The dose or dosing interval should not be changed without consulting your doctor. 
If you think you should receive Hizentra more or less frequently, please speak to your doctor. 
If you think you have missed a dose, speak to your doctor as soon as possible. 
Replacement therapy 
Your doctor will determine whether you need a loading dose (for adults and children) of at least 1 to 
2.5 ml/kg of body weight divided over several days. Following this, maintenance doses may be given 
at repeated intervals, from daily to once every two weeks, to reach a cumulative monthly dose of about 
2 to 4 ml/kg of body weight. Your healthcare professional may adjust the dose based on your response 
to the treatment. 
Immunomodulatory therapy 
Your doctor will initiate therapy with Hizentra 1 week after your last intravenous immunoglobulin 
infusion by administrating under the skin (subcutaneously) with a weekly dose of 1.0 to 2.0 ml/kg of 
body weight. Your doctor will determine your weekly Hizentra dose. The weekly maintenance doses 
may be divided into smaller doses and administered as often as required during the week. For dosing 
every two weeks, your doctor will double the weekly Hizentra dose. Your healthcare professional may 
adjust the dose based on your response to the treatment. 
Method and route of administration 
In case of home treatment, this will be initiated by a healthcare professional experienced in the 
treatment of immunodeficiency/CIDP with SCIg and in the guidance of patients for home treatment. 
You will be instructed and trained in: 
• 
• 
• 
aseptic infusion techniques 
the keeping of a treatment diary, and 
measures to be taken in case of severe side effects. 
Infusion site(s) 
• 
• 
Administer Hizentra under the skin only. 
You may infuse Hizentra into sites such as abdomen, thigh, upper arm, and lateral hip. If large 
doses are given (> 50 ml), try to administer them at multiple sites.  
You may use an unlimited number of sites simultaneously. Injection sites should be at least 
5 cm apart.  
In the case, you will use a device-assisted infusion technique (e.g. pump-assisted infusion), 
more than one infusion device can be used simultaneously. 
In the case, you will use the manual push infusion technique with a syringe, you may use only 
one infusion site per syringe. If you need to administer an additional Hizentra syringe, you must 
use a new sterile injection needle and change the infusion site. 
• 
• 
• 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
The volume of product infused into a particular site may vary. 
Infusion rate(s) 
Your doctor will determine the appropriate infusion technique and the infusion rate for you taking into 
account your individual dose, dosing frequency and product tolerability. 
Device-assisted infusion: 
The recommended initial infusion rate is up to 20 ml/hour/site. If well-tolerated, you may gradually 
increase the infusion rate to 35 ml/hour/site for the subsequent two infusions. Thereafter, the infusion 
rate can be increased further as per your tolerability. 
Manual push infusion: 
The recommended initial infusion rate is up to 0.5 ml/min/site (30 ml/hour/site). If well-tolerated, you 
may increase the infusion rate up to 2.0 ml/min/site (120 ml/hour/site) for subsequent infusions. 
Thereafter, the infusion rate can be increased further as per your tolerability. 
Instructions for use 
Follow the steps below and use aseptic technique to administer Hizentra. 
1 
Clean surface 
Thoroughly clean a table or other flat surface using an antiseptic wipe. 
Assemble supplies 
Place Hizentra and other supplies and equipment needed for the infusion on a clean, flat surface. 
Thoroughly wash and dry hands 
Check Vials 
Visually inspect Hizentra for particles in the solution or discoloration as well as expiry date before

Preparation of Hizentra for infusion 
2 
3 
4 
5 
Clean the vial stopper – Remove the protective cap from the vial 
to expose the central portion of the rubber stopper. Clean the 
stopper with an alcohol wipe or antiseptic preparation and allow it 
to dry. 
Transfer Hizentra to syringe for infusion – Attach a transfer 
device or needle to a sterile syringe, using aseptic technique. If 
using a transfer device (vented spike), follow the instructions 
provided by the device manufacturer. If using a needle, pull back 
on the plunger to draw air into the syringe that is comparable to 
the amount of Hizentra to be withdrawn. Then, insert the needle 
into the center of the vial stopper and, to avoid foaming, inject air 
into headspace of the vial (not into the liquid). Finally, withdraw 
the desired volume of Hizentra. When using multiple vials to 
achieve the desired dose, repeat this step. 
6 
Prepare the tubing 
Attach the administration tubing or needle set to the syringe. Prime the tubing to eliminate all 
remaining air.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Hizentra is and what it is used for 
What Hizentra is 
Hizentra belongs to the class of medicines called human normal immunoglobulins. Immunoglobulins 
are also known as antibodies and are blood proteins that help your body to fight infections. 
How Hizentra works 
Hizentra contains immunoglobulins that have been prepared from the blood of healthy people. 
Immunoglobulins are produced by human body’s immune system. They help your body to fight 
infections caused by bacteria and viruses or maintain the balance in your immune system (referred to 
as immunomodulation). The medicine works in exactly the same way as the immunoglobulins 
naturally present in your blood. 
What Hizentra is used for 
Replacement therapy 
Hizentra is used to raise abnormally low immunoglobulin levels in your blood to normal levels 
(replacement therapy). The medicine is used in adults and children (0-18 years) in the following 
situations: 
1.  Treatment of patients who are born with a reduced ability or inability to produce immunoglobulins 
(primary immunodeficiencies). This includes conditions such as: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
low immunoglobulin levels (hypogammaglobulinaemia) or absence of immunoglobulins 
(agammaglobulinaemia) in the blood 
combination of low immunoglobulin levels, frequent infections and inability to produce 
adequate amounts of antibodies after vaccination (common variable immunodeficiency) 
combination of low level or absence of immunoglobulins and absence or non-functional 
immune cells (severe combined immunodeficiency) 
lack of certain immunoglobulin G subclasses causing recurrent infections. 
2.  Treatment of patients with low or dysfunctional immunoglobulin levels in acquired conditions 
(secondary immunodeficiency) who experience severe or recurrent infections due to a weakened 
immune system resulting from other conditions or treatments. 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Immunomodulatory therapy in CIDP patients 
Hizentra is also used in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), a 
form of autoimmune disease. CIDP is characterised by chronic inflammation of the peripheral nerves 
that causes muscle weakness and/or numbness mainly in the legs and arms. It is believed that the 
body’s defense attack underlines such inflammation, and the immunoglobulins present in Hizentra 
help to protect the nerves from being attacked (immunomodulatory therapy). 
2.  What you need to know before you use Hizentra 
Do NOT infuse Hizentra 
► 
if you are allergic to human immunoglobulins, polysorbate 80 or L-proline. 
 
Tell your doctor or healthcare professional prior to treatment if you have experienced an 
intolerance against one of these components earlier. 
► 
► 
if you suffer from hyperprolinaemia (a genetic disorder causing high levels of the amino acid 
proline in the blood). 
into a blood vessel. 
Warnings and precautions 
 
Talk to your doctor or healthcare professional before using Hizentra. 
You may be allergic (hypersensitive) to immunoglobulins without knowing it. However, true allergic 
reactions are rare. They may occur even if you received human immunoglobulins previously and 
tolerated them well. It may happen particularly if you do not have enough of the immunoglobulin type 
A (IgA) in your blood (IgA deficiency). 
 
Tell your doctor or healthcare professional prior to treatment if you have an immunoglobulin 
type A (IgA) deficiency. Hizentra contains residual amounts of IgA which might cause an 
allergic reaction. 
In these rare cases allergic reactions, such as a sudden fall in blood pressure or shock may occur (see 
also section 4 “Possible side effects”). 
 
If you notice such signs during the infusion of Hizentra, stop the infusion and contact your 
doctor or go to the nearest hospital immediately. 
Tell your doctor if you have a history of heart or blood vessel disease or blood clots, have thick 
 
blood, or have been immobile for some time. These things may increase your risk of having a blood 
clot after using Hizentra. Also tell your doctor what drugs you are using, as some drugs, such as those 
that contain the hormone estrogen (for example, birth control pills), may increase your risk of 
developing a blood clot. Contact your doctor immediately if you experience signs and symptoms such 
as shortness of breath, chest pain, pain and swelling of a limb, weakness or numbness on one side of 
the body after receiving Hizentra. 
  Contact your doctor if you experience the following signs and symptoms: severe headache, neck 
stiffness, drowsiness, fever, photophobia, nausea, and vomiting after receiving Hizentra. Your doctor 
will decide if further tests are necessary and whether Hizentra should be continued. 
Your healthcare professional will avoid potential complications by ensuring: 
► 
that you are not sensitive to human normal immunoglobulin. 
The medicine must be infused slowly at first. The recommended infusion rate given under 
section 3 “How to use Hizentra” must be closely followed. 
that you are carefully monitored for any symptoms throughout the infusion period, especially if: 
• 
• 
• 
you receive human normal immunoglobulin for the first time 
you have switched from a different medicine 
there has been a long interval (more than eight weeks) since the previous infusion. 
► 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In these cases, it is recommended that you are monitored during the first infusion and for an 
hour afterwards. If the points above do not apply for you it is recommended that you are 
observed for at least 20 minutes after administration. 
Other medicines and Hizentra 
 
Tell your doctor or healthcare professional if you are using, have recently used or might use any 
other medicines. 
  You must not mix other medicines with Hizentra. 
 
Tell your vaccinating doctor prior to a vaccination about your treatment with Hizentra. 
Hizentra may impair the effect of some live virus vaccines such as measles, rubella, mumps and 
chicken pox. Therefore, after receiving this medicine you may have to wait up to 3 months 
before receiving your live-attenuated vaccine. In the case of measles vaccinations the 
impairment may persist for up to 1 year. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
 
Tell your doctor or healthcare professional if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant or are 
breast-feeding. Your doctor will decide whether you can receive Hizentra during your 
pregnancy or while you are breast-feeding. 
No clinical studies have been performed with Hizentra in pregnant women. However, medicines that 
contain immunoglobulins have been used in pregnant or breast-feeding women for years, and no 
harmful effects on the course of pregnancy or on the baby have been observed. 
If you are breast-feeding and receive Hizentra, the immunoglobulins of the medicine can also be found 
in the breast milk. Therefore, your baby may be protected from certain infections. 
Driving and using machines 
Patients may experience effects, such as dizziness or nausea, during treatment with Hizentra that might 
affect the ability to drive and use machines. If this happens, you should not drive or use machines until 
these effects have disappeared. 
Hizentra contains proline 
You must not take it if you suffer from hyperprolinaemia (see also section 2 “What you need to know 
before you use Hizentra”). Please tell your doctor prior to treatment. 
Other important information about Hizentra 
Blood tests 
After receiving Hizentra, the results of certain blood tests (serological tests) may be impaired for a 
certain time. 
 
Tell your doctor about your treatment with Hizentra prior to any blood test. 
Information on what Hizentra is made of 
Hizentra is made from human blood plasma (this is the liquid part of the blood). When medicines are 
made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put in place to prevent infections being 
passed on to patients. These include: 
• 
careful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections 
are excluded, and 
the testing of each donation and pools of plasma for signs of virus/infections. 
• 
Manufacturers of these medicines also include steps in the processing of the blood or plasma that can 
inactivate or remove viruses. Despite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or 
plasma are administered, the possibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. This also 
applies to any unknown or emerging viruses or other types of infections. 
The measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV, the AIDS virus), hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus (liver inflammation), and for the 
non-enveloped hepatitis A virus and parvovirus B19. 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is strongly recommended that every time you receive a dose of Hizentra the name and batch 
number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used  (see 
section 3 “How to use Hizentra”). 
Hizentra contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial/syringe, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to use Hizentra 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. 
Dosage 
Your doctor will calculate the correct dose for you taking into account your weight and response to 
treatment. 
The dose or dosing interval should not be changed without consulting your doctor. 
If you think you should receive Hizentra more or less frequently, please speak to your doctor. 
If you think you have missed a dose, speak to your doctor as soon as possible. 
Replacement therapy 
Your doctor will determine whether you need a loading dose (for adults and children) of at least 1 to 
2.5 ml/kg of body weight divided over several days. Following this, maintenance doses may be given 
at repeated intervals, from daily to once every two weeks, to reach a cumulative monthly dose of about 
2 to 4 ml/kg of body weight. Your healthcare professional may adjust the dose based on your response 
to the treatment. 
Immunomodulatory therapy 
Your doctor will initiate therapy with Hizentra 1 week after your last intravenous immunoglobulin 
infusion by administrating under the skin (subcutaneously) with a weekly dose of 1.0 to 2.0 ml/kg of 
body weight. Your doctor will determine your weekly Hizentra dose. The weekly maintenance doses 
may be divided into smaller doses and administered as often as required during the week. For dosing 
every two weeks, your doctor will double the weekly Hizentra dose. Your healthcare professional may 
adjust the dose based on your response to the treatment. 
Method and route of administration 
In case of home treatment, this will be initiated by a healthcare professional experienced in the 
treatment of immunodeficiency/CIDP with SCIg and in the guidance of patients for home treatment. 
You will be instructed and trained in: 
• 
• 
• 
aseptic infusion techniques 
the keeping of a treatment diary, and 
measures to be taken in case of severe side effects. 
Infusion site(s) 
• 
• 
Administer Hizentra under the skin only. 
You may infuse Hizentra into sites such as abdomen, thigh, upper arm, and lateral hip. If large 
doses are given (> 50 ml), try to administer them at multiple sites. 
You may use an unlimited number of sites simultaneously. Injection sites should be at least 
5 cm apart. 
In the case, you will use a device-assisted infusion technique (e.g. pump-assisted infusion), 
more than one infusion device can be used simultaneously. 
In the case, you will use the manual push infusion technique with a syringe, you may use only 
one infusion site per syringe. If you need to administer an additional Hizentra syringe, you must 
use a new sterile injection needle and change the infusion site.

The volume of product infused into a particular site may vary. 
Infusion rate(s) 
Your doctor will determine the appropriate infusion technique and the infusion rate for you taking into 
account your individual dose, dosing frequency and product tolerability. 
Device-assisted infusion: 
The recommended initial infusion rate is up to 20 ml/hour/site. If well-tolerated, you may gradually 
increase the infusion rate to 35 ml/hour/site for the subsequent two infusions. Thereafter, the infusion 
rate can be increased further as per your tolerability. 
Manual push infusion: 
The recommended initial infusion rate is up to 0.5 ml/min/site (30 ml/hour/site). If well-tolerated, you 
may increase the infusion rate up to 2.0 ml/min/site (120 ml/hour/site) for subsequent infusions. 
Thereafter, the infusion rate can be increased further as per your tolerability.

Preparation of Hizentra for infusion 
The 5 ml, 10 ml and 20 ml pre-filled 
syringes are supplied  ready to use. The 5 
ml and 10 ml prefilled syringes (a.1) are 
fully assembled. 
For the 20 ml prefilled syringe (b.1), screw 
the plunger rod (b.3) onto the prefilled 
syringe stopper with inside thread (b.4) 
prior to use. 
All pre-filled syringes have a standard luer 
lock (a.2 and b.2), which is a screw 
connection at the syringe tip that creates a 
leak-free seal. 
44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you are using a syringe pump, Hizentra pre-filled syringes can be 
placed directly in the syringe pump if the syringe size matches the 
pump requirements.  
If the pre-filled syringe can be placed directly on the pump, then go 
to Step 6. 
If the Hizentra pre-filled syringe size does not match the pump 
requirements, then the contents of the pre-filled syringe can be 
transferred to another syringe of a size specific for the pump.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for liraglutide, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on hypoglycaemia with liraglutide overdose, from clinical trial(s), literature 
and spontaneous reports, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between liraglutide overdose and 
hypoglycaemia a reasonable possibility. The existing wording in section 4.9 of the SmPC and 
corresponding sections in the Package Leaflet of liraglutide in T2DM and WM should be amended to 
inform HCP’s that hypoglycaemia has occurred in cases of liraglutide overdose. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for liraglutide the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing liraglutide is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

2. Scientific discussion 
Introduction 
The active substance in Zoledronic acid Teva, zoledronic acid, is a bisphosphonate. It stops the action of 
the osteoclasts, the cells in the body that are involved in breaking down the bone tissue. This leads to less 
bone loss. The reduction of bone loss helps to make bones less likely to break, which is useful in 
preventing fractures in cancer patients with bone metastases.  
Patients with tumours can have high levels of calcium in their blood, released from the bones. By 
preventing the breakdown of bones, Zoledronic acid Teva also helps to reduce the amount of calcium 
released into the blood.

The current application concerns a generic version of zoledronic acid solution for infusion (4 mg /100 ml). 
The reference product is Zometa. The applicant applied for the following indications which are the same 
as for the reference product:  
−  Prevention of skeletal related events (pathological fractures, spinal compression, radiation or 
surgery to bone, or tumour-induced hypercalcaemia) in adult patients with advanced 
malignancies involving bone.  
−  Treatment of adult patients with tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH). 
This application is an extension of marketing authorisation to include an additional pharmaceutical form: 
Solution for infusion. Zoledronic acid Teva 4 mg/100 ml solution for infusion is the same strength as that 
prepared by dilution of the currently approved/marketed Zoledronic acid Teva 4 mg/ 5 ml concentrate.  
Quality aspects 
Introduction 
The medicinal product is presented as solution for infusion (4 mg /100 ml) of zoledronic acid as the active 
substance, intended for intravenous use. 
The excipients, as listed in the SmPC section 6.1, are mannitol, sodium citrate, sodium chloride and water 
for injections. 
The product is available in Cyclic Olefin Polymer (COP) plastic bottles closed by grey chlorobutyl/butyl 
rubber stopper and blue plastic flip-off cap. 
Active Substance 
The active substance used in the solution for infusion (4 mg /100 ml) is the same active substance as the 
one approved for the currently authorised presentation (concentrate for solution for infusion 4 mg/5 ml) 
and no new information has been presented. 
Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to develop a diluted product of the concentrate for 
solution for infusion. This new pharmaceutical form was developed to facilitate administration to patients. 
This presentation is also authorised for the reference medicinal product Zometa. 
The applied product has the same qualitative composition as Zometa 4 mg/5 ml concentrate for solution 
of infusion and Zometa 4 mg/100 ml solution for infusion except that the applied product contains sodium 
chloride and the reference products do not. A comparison of the physicochemical properties of the 
products (appearance, pH, osmolality, viscosity, impurities and assay) demonstrates essential similarity 
of the products. 
Since the formulation is an aqueous intravenous solution containing the same active substance at the 
same concentration as the reference product no bioequivalence studies are required.  
Assessment report  
EMA/631924/2014 
Page 5/14 
 
  
  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The primary packaging is Cyclic Olefin Polymer (COP) plastic bottle, fitted with a chlorobutyl/butyl rubber 
stopper and aluminium cap fitted with blue plastic flip off disc.The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process is a standard process for parenteral formulations and consists of four main 
steps: dissolution, sterile filtration, filling and terminal moist heat sterilisation.  
The required manufacturing parameters and ranges were determined during manufacturing process 
development and process validation. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. Validation of the 
manufacturing process has been performed on three commercial scale batches. It has been demonstrated 
that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a 
reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and 
pharmaceutical form.  
Product specification 
The release and shelf life specification includes tests and limits appropriate for this kind of dosage form for  
the following parameters:  description (visual), clarity of solution (Ph.Eur), visible particles (Ph.Eur), 
colour of solution (Ph.Eur), osmolality (Ph.Eur), extractable volume (Ph.Eur), pH value (Ph.Eur), 
identification (In-house), assay (In-house), related substances (In-house), sub-visible particles (Ph.Eur), 
bacterial endotoxins (Ph.Eur) and sterility (Ph.Eur). 
Batch analysis results from three commercial scale batches confirm consistency and uniformity of 
manufacture and indicate that the process is under control. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of tree production scale batches of finished product stored under long term conditions for 12 
months at 25 ºC / 60 % RH, under intermediate conditions for 12 months at 30 ºC / 65 % RH and for up 
to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75 % RH according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided.  
The batches of Zoledronic acid Teva solution for infusion 4 mg/100 ml are identical to those proposed for 
marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
The shelf life specifications are the same as for release and include a test for weight loss.  
A photostability study was performed on one batch in accordance with the requirements of ICH Q1B. 
Results of the photo-stability studies demonstrate that Zoledronic acid Teva 4 mg/100 ml solution for 
infusion is not light sensitive. 
In addition a freeze-thaw study with three cycles (<-15 °C/48 hours / +40 °C/48 hours) was performed 
for one batch with no significant changes were observed.

Based on available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are 
acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
 No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
Non-clinical aspects 
Introduction 
The applicant presented justifications for not generating additional non-clinical pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of 
the reference product. The impurity profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The proposed new pharmaceutical form, Zoledronic acid Teva 4 mg/100 ml, solution for infusion is 
intended to be marketed as alternative presentation to the currently marketed Zoledronic acid Teva 4 
mg/5 ml concentrate for solution for infusion. The use of this product is not expected to increase the risk 
to the environment. In conclusion, it is acceptable that no new ERA is provided with this application. 
Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical studies have been performed, and none are required for this type of application. 
There are no non-clinical issues that need to be addressed.

Product information 
User consultation 
The package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of the 
label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
Benefit-Risk Balance  
Neither non-clinical studies nor clinical studies have been provided for this line extension application, 
which is considered acceptable. An adequate summary of the available non clinical information for the 
active substance was presented in the application for the original dosage form (Zoledronic acid Teva 4 
mg/ 5 ml concentrate for solution for infusion, approved in August 2012), which is considered sufficient 
for this application as well. From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance. 
The current state of knowledge concerning the safety and efficacy of the reference product has been 
evaluated by means of a literature search and there is no data to indicate any likely change to the 
benefit/risk ratio. The applicant’s clinical overview on the clinical aspects presented in the application for 
Zoledronic acid Teva 4 mg/5 ml concentrate for solution for infusion based on information from published 
literature is considered sufficient for this application as well. However, there are still some minor 
comments on the product information (see below).  
The application is composed of satisfactory quality data.  No additional non-clinical or clinical data have 
been provided, which is satisfactory for this line extension; bioequivalence data are not required for this 
intravenous aqueous solution.  A satisfactory update of the RMP has been submitted by the Applicant. A 
benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the risk-benefit balance of Zoledronic acid Teva solution for infusion 4mg/100ml in the prevention of 
skeletal related events and treatment of tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH) is favourable and 
therefore recommends the granting of the extension of the marketing authorisation subject to the

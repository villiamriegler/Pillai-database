Summary of risk management plan for Cibinqo (abrocitinib) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Cibinqo. The RMP details important 
risks of Cibinqo, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about Cibinqo’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Cibinqo’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Cibinqo should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Cibinqo should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Cibinqo's 
RMP. 
I. The Medicine and What It Is Used For 
Cibinqo is indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adults who are 
candidates for systemic therapy (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains abrocitinib as the 
active substance and it is given by oral route of administration. 
Further information about the evaluation of Cibinqo’s benefits can be found in Cibinqo’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s 
webpage: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/cibinqo  
II. Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further Characterise 
the Risks 
Important risks of Cibinqo, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Cibinqo 's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.  
In the case of Cibinqo, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events will be collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Cibinqo is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of Cibinqo are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of Cibinqo. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to 
information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine);

Off-label in Paediatric Patients <18 Years-of-Age 
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the medicine 
In studies to support the use of abrocitinib in children <12 years old, administration of 
abrocitinib to juvenile rats (comparable to a 3-month-old human) resulted in 
macroscopic and microscopic bone findings. 
In toxicity studies of up to 1 month of abrocitinib dosing in rats at an age comparable 
to adolescent human age a microscopic bone dystrophy finding, considered transient 
and reversible, was noted, and exposure margins at which no bone finding was noted 
were 6x to 6.4x the unbound human AUC at a clinical dose of 200 mg QD. No bone 
findings were observed in rats at any dose in the 6-month toxicity study in any of the 
toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkey.

B7451084:  An Active Surveillance Study to Monitor the Real-World Safety of Abrocitinib 
among Patients with Atopic Dermatitis in the EU  
Purpose of the study:  
Based on data from Cibinqo clinical program, it is of MAH’s opinion that it is important to 
monitor the real-world safety of Cibinqo following its authorization in the EU.  An active safety 
surveillance study will assess safety endpoints of interest with Cibinqo in the post-approval 
setting. 
The study objective is to estimate incidence rates of safety endpoints of interest among AD 
patients receiving abrocitinib and AD patients receiving appropriate systemic treatments 
including dupilumab for AD in the real-world setting.   
The following are the primary safety endpoints of interest:  
•  VTE, 
•  Herpes zoster,  
•  Serious and Opportunistic infections, 
•  Rhabdomyolysis, 
•  Gastrointestinal perforation, 
•  Malignancy,  
•  MACE,  
•  Fractures, and  
•  All-cause mortality. 
B7451085: A Drug Utilization Study to Evaluate the Effectiveness of Risk Minimisation 
Measures for Abrocitinib in the EU Using Electronic Healthcare Data  
Purpose of the study:  
To mitigate the risks associated with abrocitinib, required routine RMMs including the SmPC 
and package leaflet are being employed. In order to minimise important risks with the use of 
Cibinqo, the MAH has also implemented additional RMMs: an educational program intended to 
enhance the communication of the risk and risk minimisation practices to HCPs and patients. 
The program includes a Prescriber Brochure, a DHPC and a Patient Card. 
The MAH plans to evaluate the effectiveness of RMMs being implemented for abrocitinib. The 
proposed study will be designated as a PASS. 
The research question will be: Do HCPs in the EU adhere to the recommendations for the use of 
abrocitinib described in the SmPC, prescriber brochure and DHPC? 
The study objectives are to evaluate, to the extent measurable in the available routinely collected 
data, indicators of HCPs’ adherence to the prescribing information in accordance with the 
abrocitinib SmPC, prescriber brochure, and DHPC specifically: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Indicators of adherence to performing laboratory tests of complete blood count (CBC), 
lipid panel, hepatitis B/C and tuberculosis (TB) screening prior to initiation of abrocitinib 
treatment, 
Indicators of adherence to performing laboratory tests of CBC and lipid panel at Week 4 
(± 2 weeks) from initiation of abrocitinib treatment, 
Indicators of adherence to consideration of risk factors for VTE, MACE, and malignancy 
prior to treatment with abrocitinib, 
Indicators of adherence to avoid live attenuated vaccine immediately prior to and during 
treatment with abrocitinib, 
Indicators of adherence to contraindications for use during pregnancy, and 
Indicators of adherence to not use in patients aged <18 years of age. 
Study B7451015: A Phase 3 Multi-Center, Long-Term Extension Study Investigating the 
Efficacy and Safety of Abrocitinib, With or Without Topical Medications, Administered to 
Subjects Aged 12 Years and Older with Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis 
Purpose of the Study:  
The objective of this study is to assess the long-term safety of 100 mg and 200 mg once daily of 
abrocitinib with or without topical treatments in adult and adolescent subjects who previously 
participated in qualifying abrocitinib AD trials. 
The study objectives will be to assess safety by the spontaneous reporting of AEs, physical 
examinations and clinical laboratory results in all subjects who receive at least one dose of the 
investigational product. This study will continue to describe safety data to include: 
o  VTE,  
o  Serious and opportunistic infections, 
o  Herpes zoster, 
o  Malignancy, 
o  Fracture, including in adolescents,  
o  Myopathy (including rhabdomyolysis), 
o  Gastrointestinal perforation, 
o  MACE, 
o  Height in adolescents, 
 
o  Development in adolescents, 
o  Pregnancy outcomes, and 
o  All-cause mortality. 
Study B7451015: Adolescent Imaging Substudy 
Purpose of the Substudy: 
The objective of this substudy is to evaluate the potential effects of abrocitinib in terms of 
abnormal bone findings in knee MRI in subjects enrolled as adolescents (12 to <18 years of age) 
in the abrocitinib development program. The substudy will evaluate the proportion of abnormal 
bone finding in knee MRI in adolescent subjects exposed to abrocitinib 100 mg and 200 mg QD.

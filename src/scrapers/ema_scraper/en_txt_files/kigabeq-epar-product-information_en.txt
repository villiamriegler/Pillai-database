Kigabeq is for oral or gastric administration twice daily and may be taken before or after meals.  
The maximum recommended dose should not be exceeded. 
If control of epilepsy is not clinically significantly improved after an adequate treatment course, 
vigabatrin treatment should be discontinued. Vigabatrin should be gradually withdrawn under close 
medical supervision. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
Since vigabatrin is eliminated via the kidneys, caution should be exercised when administering the 
medicinal product to patients with creatinine clearance less than 60 ml/min. Adjustment of dose 
should be considered. Such patients may respond to a lower maintenance dose. Patients should be 
monitored for adverse reactions such as sedation or confusion (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
Hepatic impairment 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Vigabatrin is not metabolised by hepatic enzymes, hence there is no need of adjustment of dose or 
frequency of administration. Interference of vigabatrin administration with serological testing of some 
hepatic enzymes including ALT has been evidenced (see section 4.4).  
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of Kigabeq in neonates (below 27 days of age) in the indication “infantile 
spasms” and in children and adolescents above 7 years of age in the indication “resistant partial 
epilepsy” (focal onset seizures). Other appropriate vigabatrin-containing medicinal products are 
already available for administration to this latter population.  
Method of administration  
Kigabeq is for oral or gastric use and may be taken before or after meals.  
Gastric administration should be used for children who cannot swallow, but can be fed by enteral 
route. 
The method of administration will be determined by a physician specialised in epileptology, neurology 
or paediatric neurology. 
For instructions on dissolution and handling of the medicinal product before administration, see 
section 6.6. 
Oral administration 
Since no stability studies have been performed with other solvents than water, for preparing oral 
solution only water should be used. When the tablets are fully disintegrated, the whole content of 
solution should be administered straight away to the child directly from the drinking glass. If there is a 
risk of regurgitation or if the child is not old enough to drink from a glass, the whole content of 
solution should be withdrawn with a syringe for oral use, the end of the syringe should be put in the 
mouth of the child and gently pushed on the plunger. 
Once the child has entirely drunk the medicine solution, the drinking glass should be rinsed with one 
or two teaspoons of water (approximately 5 or 10 ml) and dispensed to the child by the same way. 
Gastric administration 
For patients who cannot swallow, administration of Kigabeq using a gastric tube is possible.  
Tablets are disintegrated in approximately 5 or 10 ml of water and the resulting solution is introduced 
into the tube using an adapted syringe. The gastric tube should be rinsed with 10 ml of water. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Visual field defects (VFD) have been reported in patients receiving vigabatrin with a high prevalence 
(about 1/3 of patients). Frequencies found in an open clinical study are presented in section 4.8. The 
onset is usually after months to years of vigabatrin therapy. The degree of visual field constriction may 
be severe and this may have practical consequences for the patient. Vigabatrin can cause permanent 
vision loss. 
Most of the patients with perimetry-confirmed defects have been asymptomatic. Hence, this 
undesirable effect can only be reliably detected by systematic perimetry which is usually possible only 
in patients with a developmental age of more than 9 years. For younger patients electroretinography 
should be used (see visual field defects). 
Available data suggests that visual field defects are irreversible even after discontinuation of 
vigabatrin. A deterioration of VFD after the treatment is discontinued cannot be excluded. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Therefore, vigabatrin should only be used after careful benefit/ risk assessment compared with 
alternatives. 
Vigabatrin is not recommended for use in patients with any pre-existing clinically significant visual 
field defect. 
Patients should undergo systematic screening examination when starting vigabatrin and at regular 
intervals for detection of visual field defects. Visual field testing should continue at 6-month intervals 
for the whole duration of treatment. The assessment must be continued 6 to 12 months after the 
discontinuation of therapy (see visual field defects).  
Visual field defects (VFD) 
Based on available data, the usual pattern is a concentric constriction of the visual field of both eyes, 
which is generally more marked nasally than temporally. In the central visual field (within 30 degree 
of eccentricity), frequently an annular nasal defect is seen. However, the VFDs reported in patients 
receiving vigabatrin have ranged from mild to severe. Severe cases are potentially disabling and may 
be characterized by tunnel vision. Blindness was also reported in severe cases.  
Most patients with perimetry-confirmed defects had not previously spontaneously noticed any 
symptoms, even in cases where a severe defect was observed in perimetry. Available evidence 
suggests that the VFD is irreversible even after discontinuation of vigabatrin. A deterioration of VFD 
after the treatment is discontinued cannot be excluded. 
Pooled data from prevalence surveys suggest that as many as 1/3 of patients receiving vigabatrin 
therapy have VFDs. Males may be at greater risk than females. Frequencies found in an open clinical 
study are presented in section 4.8. A possible association between the risk of visual field defects and 
the extent of vigabatrin exposure, both in terms of daily dose (from 1 gram to more than 3 grams) and 
in terms of duration of treatment (maximum during the first three years) has been shown in this study. 
All patients should have ophthalmological consultation before or shortly after the initiation of 
vigabatrin treatment.  
Perimetry is seldom possible in children less than 9 years of developmental age. The risks of treatment 
must be very carefully weighed against possible benefit in children. Currently, there is no established 
method to diagnose or exclude visual field defects in children in whom a standardised perimetry 
cannot be performed. Frequency and severity have only been indirectly characterised in this 
population on the presence of electroretinogram or visual evoked potential anomalies. 
Electroretinography is recommended in infants and children who are unable to cooperate with 
perimetry. Based on the available data the first oscillatory potential and 30 Hz flicker responses of the 
electroretinogram appear to be correlated with a vigabatrin associated VFD. These responses are 
delayed and reduced beyond the normal limits. Such changes have not been seen in vigabatrin treated 
patients without a VFD. 
The parents and/or caregivers must be given a thorough description of the frequency and Implications 
of the development of VFD during vigabatrin treatment. 
VFD may not be detected until it is severe and undetected moderate defects may affect child integrity. 
Therefore, vision assessment is required at baseline (no later than 4 weeks after starting treatment) and 
at least every 6 months while on therapy. The assessment must be continued 6 to 12 months after the 
discontinuation of therapy.  
Available data suggests that visual field defects are irreversible.  
If a visual field constriction is observed during follow-up, consideration should be given to gradual 
discontinuation of vigabatrin. If the decision to continue treatment is made, consideration should be 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
given to more frequent follow-up (perimetry) in order to detect progression or sight threatening 
defects. 
Vigabatrin should not be used concomitantly with other retinotoxic medicinal products.  
Neurologic and psychiatric conditions  
In view of the results of the animal safety studies (see section 5.3) it is recommended that patients 
treated with vigabatrin are closely observed for adverse reactions on neurological function. 
Rare reports of encephalopathic symptoms such as marked sedation, stupor and confusion in 
association with non-specific slow wave activity on electroencephalogram have been described soon 
after the initiation of vigabatrin treatment. Risk factors for the development of these reactions include 
higher than recommended starting dose, faster dose escalation at higher steps than recommended and 
renal failure. These events have been reversible following dose reduction or discontinuation of 
vigabatrin (see section 4.8).  
Abnormal magnetic resonance imaging signals 
Abnormal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal changes characterised by increased T2 signal and 
restricted diffusion in a symmetric pattern involving the thalamus, basal ganglia, brain stem, and 
cerebellum have been observed in some infants treated with vigabatrin for infantile spasms. In a 
retrospective epidemiologic study in infants with infantile spasms (N = 205), the prevalence of these 
changes was 22 % in vigabatrin treated patients versus 4 % in patients treated with other therapies.  
In the study above, in post-marketing experience, and in published literature reports, these changes 
generally resolved with discontinuation of treatment. In a few patients, the lesion resolved despite 
continued use.  
Additionally, cases of intramyelinic oedema (IME) have been reported, particularly in infants treated 
for infantile spasms (see section 4.8 and 5.3). IME has been reported to be reversible following 
vigabatrin discontinuation, and it is therefore recommended to progressively discontinue vigabatrin 
when IME is observed. 
Movement disorders including dystonia, dyskinesia and hypertonia, have been reported in patients 
treated with vigabatrin for infantile spasms. The benefit/risk ratio of vigabatrin should be evaluated on 
an individual patient basis. If new movement disorders occur during treatment with vigabatrin, 
consideration should be given to dose reduction or a gradual discontinuation of treatment. 
Some patients may experience an increase in seizure frequency or the onset of new types of seizures 
with vigabatrin (see section 4.8). Patients with myoclonic seizures may be particularly susceptible to 
this effect. New onset myoclonus and exacerbation of existing myoclonus may occur in rare cases. These 
phenomena  may  also  be  the  consequence  of  an  overdose,  a  decrease  in  plasma  concentrations  of 
concomitant antiepileptic treatment, or a paradoxical effect.  
Abrupt withdrawal may lead to rebound seizures. If a patient is to be withdrawn from vigabatrin 
treatment, it is recommended that this is done by gradual dose reduction over a 2- to 4-week period.  
Vigabatrin should be used with caution in patients with a history of psychosis, depression or 
behavioural problems. Psychiatric events (e.g., agitation, depression, abnormal thinking, paranoid 
reactions) have been reported during vigabatrin treatment. These events occurred in patients with and 
without a psychiatric history and were usually reversible when vigabatrin doses were reduced or 
gradually discontinued. 
Suicidal ideation and behaviour 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Suicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with antiepileptic medicinal 
products in several indications. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials of 
antiepileptic medicinal products has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and 
behaviour. The mechanism of this effect is not known and the available data do not exclude the 
possibility of an increased risk for vigabatrin.  
Therefore, patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviour, and appropriate 
treatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical 
advice immediately should signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge. 
Renal impairment 
Since vigabatrin is eliminated via the kidneys, caution should be exercised in patients with a creatinine 
clearance of less than 60 ml/min. These patients should be monitored closely for undesirable effects 
such as sedation and confusion (see section 4.2). 
Interference with serological testing 
Vigabatrin may lead to a decrease in measured plasma activity of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and 
to a lesser extent, aspartate aminotransferase (AST). The magnitude of suppression for ALT has been 
reported to vary between 30 % and 100 %. Therefore, these liver tests may be quantitatively unreliable 
in patients taking vigabatrin (see section 4.8). 
Vigabatrin may increase the amount of amino acids in the urine possibly leading to a false positive test 
for certain rare genetic metabolic disorders (e.g., alpha aminoadipic aciduria). 
Risk of medication error 
Because both tablet strengths (100 mg and 500 mg) can be used concomitantly there may be confusion 
between the tablets or tablet halves administered with a risk of incorrect dosing. Special attention 
should be paid to the tablet size to correctly identify the strength. 
Excipients  
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
As vigabatrin is neither metabolised, nor protein bound and is not an inducer of hepatic cytochrome 
P450 metabolising-enzymes, interactions with other medicinal products are unlikely. However, during 
controlled clinical studies, a gradual reduction of 16-33 % in the plasma concentration of phenytoin 
has been observed. The exact nature of this interaction is presently not understood, however, in the 
majority of cases it is unlikely to be of therapeutic significance. 
The plasma concentrations of carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and sodium valproate have also been 
monitored during controlled clinical trials and no clinically significant interactions have been detected. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
This medicinal product is not intended for use in women of child-bearing potential. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Breastfeeding 
This medicinal product is not intended for use in women who are breastfeeding. 
Fertility 
Fertility studies in rats have shown no effect on male and female fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Kigabeq has major influence on the ability to perform hazardous activities. 
In view of the fact that drowsiness has been observed in clinical trials with vigabatrin, patients should 
be warned of this possibility at the start of treatment. 
Visual field defects which can significantly affect the ability to perform hazardous activities have been 
frequently reported in association with vigabatrin. Patients should be evaluated for the presence of 
visual field defects (see also section 4.4). Special care should be taken with infants, toddlers and 
children cycling, climbing or performing any other hazardous activity. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions related to vigabatrin are visual field defects (ranging 
from mild to severe and occurring usually after months to years of vigabatrin therapy), psychiatric 
disorders such as agitation, excitation, aggression, nervousness, depression, paranoid reaction, nervous 
system disorders such as marked sedation, stupor and confusion. Rarely seen events include suicide 
attempts, encephalopathy and retinal disorders.  
Some patients may experience an increase in seizure frequency, including status epilepticus with 
vigabatrin. Patients with myoclonic seizures may be particularly susceptible to this effect. New onset 
myoclonus and exacerbation of existing myoclonus may occur in rare cases.

Epidemiology of VFD in patients with refractory partial epilepsy was observed in an observational, 
open-label, multicentre, comparative, parallel group, Phase IV study, including 734 patients, at least 8 
years old, with refractory partial epilepsy for at least one year. 
Patients were split in three treatment groups: patients currently treated with vigabatrin (group I), 
patients previously exposed to vigabatrin (group II) and patients never exposed to vigabatrin (group 
III).

Psychiatric disorders 
Psychiatric reactions have been reported during vigabatrin therapy. These reactions occurred in 
patients with and without a psychiatric history and were usually reversible when vigabatrin doses were 
reduced or gradually discontinued (see section 4.4). Depression was a common psychiatric reaction in 
clinical trials but seldom required discontinuation of vigabatrin.  
Encephalopathy 
Rare reports of encephalopathic symptoms such as marked sedation, stupor and confusion in 
association with non-specific slow wave activity on electroencephalogram have been described soon 
after the initiation of vigabatrin treatment. Such reactions have been fully reversible following dose 
reduction or discontinuation of vigabatrin (see section 4.4).  
Investigations 
Laboratory data indicate that vigabatrin treatment does not lead to renal toxicity. Decreases in ALT 
and AST, which are considered to be a result of inhibition of these aminotransferases by vigabatrin, 
have been observed. Chronic treatment with vigabatrin may be associated with a slight decrease in 
haemoglobin which rarely attains significance. 
Abnormal MRI signals 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Asymptomatic and transient MRI abnormalities in the brain have been observed in some infants 
treated with vigabatrin for infantile spasms. The clinical significance of these MRI abnormalities is 
unknown. As routine MRI surveillance of this paediatric population is not recommended, the 
frequency of MRI abnormalities cannot be reliably estimated from the available data. Movement 
disorders either alone or in association with abnormalities in MRI have been reported in patients 
treated with vigabatrin for infantile spasms but their frequency is not known. 
Paediatric population 
Psychiatric disorders 
Very common: excitation, agitation 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms 
Vigabatrin overdose has been reported. When provided, doses were most commonly between 7.5 to 
30 g; however, ingestions up to 90 g have been reported. Nearly half of the cases involved multiple 
substance ingestions. When reported, the most common symptoms included drowsiness or coma. 
Other less frequently reported symptoms included vertigo, headache, psychosis, respiratory depression 
or apnoea, bradycardia, hypotension, agitation, irritability, confusion, abnormal behaviour, and speech 
disorder.  
Management 
There is no specific antidote. The usual supportive measures should be employed. Measures to remove 
unabsorbed medicinal product should be considered. Activated charcoal has been shown to not 
significantly adsorb vigabatrin in an in vitro study. The effectiveness of haemodialysis in the treatment 
of vigabatrin overdose is unknown. In isolated case reports in renal failure patients receiving 
therapeutic doses of vigabatrin, haemodialysis reduced vigabatrin plasma concentrations by 40 % to 
60 %.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antiepileptics, fatty acid derivatives, ATC code: N03AG04 
Mechanism of action 
Vigabatrin is a selective irreversible inhibitor of GABA transaminase, the enzyme responsible for the 
breakdown of GABA (gamma aminobutyric acid). Vigabatrin increases the concentration of GABA, 
the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain.  
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Controlled and long-term clinical trials have shown that vigabatrin is an effective anticonvulsant agent 
when given as first line treatment in patients with infantile spasms and as add-on therapy in patients 
with epilepsy not controlled satisfactorily by conventional therapy. This efficacy is particularly 
marked in patients with seizures of partial origin. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Adults 
Absorption 
Vigabatrin is a water soluble compound and it is rapidly and completely absorbed from the 
gastrointestinal tract. Food administration does not alter the extent of vigabatrin absorption. Time to 
reach maximum plasma concentrations (tmax) is approximately 1 hour. 
Distribution 
Vigabatrin is widely distributed with an apparent volume of distribution slightly greater than total 
body water. Binding to plasma proteins is negligible. Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid concentrations 
are linearly related to dose over the recommended dose range. 
Biotransformation 
Vigabatrin is not significantly metabolised. No metabolites have been identified in plasma. 
Elimination 
Vigabatrin is eliminated via renal excretion with a terminal half-life of 5-8 hours. Oral clearance 
(Cl/F) of vigabatrin is approximately 7  L/h (i.e. 0.10 L/h/kg). Approximately 70 % of a single oral 
dose was recovered as unchanged vigabatrin in the urine in the first 24 hours post-dose. 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship(s) 
There is no direct correlation between plasma concentration and efficacy. The duration of the effect of 
the medicinal product is dependent on the GABA transaminase re-synthesis rate. 
Paediatric population 
Pharmacokinetic properties of vigabatrin have been investigated in groups of six neonates (age 15-
26 days), six infants (age 5-22 months) and six children (age 4.6-14.2 years) with refractory epilepsy.  
After administration of a single 37-50 mg/kg dose of an oral solution vigabatrin tmax was 
approximately 2.5 hours in neonates and infants, and 1 hour in children. Mean terminal half-life of 
vigabatrin was about 7.5 hours in neonates, 5.7 hours in infants and 5.5 hours in children. The mean 
Cl/F of active S-enantiomer of vigabatrin in infants and children was 0.591 L/h/kg and 0.446 L/h/kg 
respectively. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Animal safety studies carried out in the rat, mouse, dog and monkey have indicated that vigabatrin has 
no significant adverse reactions on the liver, kidney, lung, heart or gastrointestinal tract.  
In the brain, microvacuolation due to intramyelinic oedema has been observed in white matter tracts of 
rat, mouse and dog at doses of 30-50 mg/kg/day. In the monkey these lesions are minimal or 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
equivocal. In both rat and dog they were reversible on stopping vigabatrin treatment and even 
regressed with continued treatment.  
Vigabatrin-associated retinotoxicity has been observed in 80-100 % of albino rats at the dose of 
300 mg/kg/day orally, but not in pigmented rats, dogs or monkeys. The retinal changes in albino rats 
were characterised as focal or multifocal disorganisation of the outer nuclear layer while the other 
layers of retina were not affected.  
Animal experiments have shown that vigabatrin has no negative influence on fertility or pup 
development. No teratogenicity was seen in rats in doses up to 150 mg/kg (3 times the human dose) or 
in rabbits in doses up to 100 mg/kg. However, in rabbits, a slight increase in the incidence of cleft 
palate at doses of 150-200 mg/kg was seen. 
Studies with vigabatrin revealed no evidence of mutagenic or carcinogenic effects.

Read all of this leaflet carefully before you give this medicine to your child because it contains 
important information. 
- 
- 
- 
Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  
If you have any further questions, ask your child’s doctor or pharmacist. 
This medicine has been prescribed for your child. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, 
even if their signs of illness are the same as your child’s. 
If your child gets any side effects, talk to your child’s doctor or pharmacist. This includes any 
possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Kigabeq is and what it is used for 
Kigabeq contains vigabatrin and it is used for treating infants and children aged from 1 month to less 
than 7 years. It is used to treat infantile spasms (West’s syndrome) or, together with other epilepsy 
medicines to treat partial epilepsy that is not controlled well enough with current treatment.  
2.  What you need to know before your child takes Kigabeq  
Do not give Kigabeq: 
- 
if your child is allergic to vigabatrin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your child’s doctor before you give Kigabeq if your child: 
- 
- 
- 
has or has had depression or any other psychiatric illness in the past 
has had any kidney problems as he/she could develop symptoms like sedation or confusion  
has had any eye problems. 
Visual field loss (loss of sight from the edges of your child’s field of vision) may occur during 
treatment with vigabatrin. You should discuss this possibility with the doctor before your child begins 
treatment and the doctor will tell you how to detect this side effect. This visual field loss may be 
severe and permanent, so it must be detected early to avoid progression. Worsening of visual field loss 
may continue after stopping treatment. It is important that you tell the doctor promptly if there is any 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
change in your child’s vision. The doctor will check your child’s visual field before your child starts 
taking vigabatrin and carry on checking it at regular intervals during the treatment. 
If your child develops symptoms like sleepiness, reduced consciousness and movements (stupor) or 
confusion, tell your child’s doctor who may reduce the dose or stop Kigabeq treatment. 
A small number of people being treated with epilepsy medicines such as vigabatrin have had thoughts 
of harming or killing themselves. Look for symptoms suggestive of such thoughts: disturbed sleep, 
loss of appetite or weight, isolation, loss of interest for favorite activities. 
If at any time your child has had these symptoms, immediately contact child’s doctor. 
Movement disorders can occur in young infants treated for infantile spasms (West’s syndrome). If you 
see unusual movements in your child, tell your child’s doctor who may change the treatment. 
Tell your child’s doctor if your child has had or is going to perform laboratory tests because this 
medicine may lead to abnormal results. 
You must speak to your child’s doctor if your child’s condition does not improve within a month of 
starting vigabatrin.  
Children 
Do not give this medicine to children less than 1 month of age or more than 7 years of age. 
Other medicines and Kigabeq 
Tell your child’s doctor if the child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
Kigabeq should not be used in combination with other medicines that may have side effects related to 
the eye. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
This medicine is not intended for use in women of child-bearing potential or in breast-feeding women. 
Driving and using machines 
Your child should not ride a bicycle, climb or take part in hazardous activity if the child has symptoms 
like drowsiness or dizziness with Kigabeq. Visual disorders, which can affect the ability to cycle, 
climb or take part in hazardous activity, have occurred in some patients taking this medicine. 
Kigabeq contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
3. 
How to give Kigabeq 
Always give this medicine to your child exactly as the doctor has told you. Check with the doctor or 
pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Dose 
Never change the dose yourself. The doctor works out the dose individually for your child, taking 
account of the child’s body weight. 
Kigabeq is available as 100 mg or 500 mg tablets which can be given together to make up the right 
dose for your child. Always check the label and the size of the tablets to make sure you are giving the 
right dose. 
In infantile spasms (West’s Syndrome), the recommended starting dose is 50 milligrams per kilogram 
bodyweight daily. In resistant partial epilepsy (focal onset seizures), the recommended starting dose is 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
40 milligrams per kilogram daily. The doctor will adjust the dose during treatment as necessary. If 
your child has kidney problems, the doctor may prescribe a smaller dose.

How to give this medicine 
Ask your child’s doctor to show you how to give this medicine. Check with the doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure. 
Kigabeq is to be given by mouth and may be taken before or after meals. The tablet can be cut into 
equal halves. 
Use only water to prepare solution. 
•  Pour one or two teaspoonfuls (about 5 to 10 ml) of water into a drinking glass or beaker 
•  Add the right dose of Kigabeq tablets (as whole or half tablets) to the water 
•  Wait until the tablet has broken down completely. This takes less than a minute but you can speed 
it up by stirring the mixture gently by hand 
•  The mixture will be whitish and cloudy. This is normal and the cloudiness is because the tablet 
contains some excipients that do not dissolve completely 
•  Give the mixture straightway to your child direct from the drinking glass or beaker 
• 
If your child cannot drink from the glass or beaker then you can use an oral syringe to gently 
squirt the mixture into your child's mouth, taking care not to cause choking: sit just in front and 
below your child in order that he/she has the head leaning forward and administer the mixture 
against his cheek

•  Rinse the glass or beaker with one or two teaspoonfuls (about 5 to 10 ml) of water and give this to 
• 
your child to make sure that the child receives all the medicine 
If the child cannot swallow, the mixture can be given through a gastric tube, using a suitable 
syringe. The tube should be rinsed with 10 ml of water 
If your child takes too much Kigabeq 
If your child accidentally takes too many Kigabeq tablets, tell the doctor immediately or go to your 
nearest hospital or poison information centre. Possible signs of overdose include drowsiness or 
reduced level of consciousness. 
If you forget to give your child Kigabeq 
If you forget to give your child a dose, give the dose as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for 
the next dose, just give one dose. Do not give a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet.  
If you stop giving Kigabeq to your child 
Do not stop giving this medicine without talking to your child’s doctor. If the doctor decides to stop 
the treatment you will be advised to gradually reduce the dose. Do not stop suddenly as this may cause 
your child’s seizures to occur again. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask the doctor or pharmacist.

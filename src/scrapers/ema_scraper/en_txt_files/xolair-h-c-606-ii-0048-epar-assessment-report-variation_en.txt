2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Xolair (omalizumab) is presently approved for the treatment of severe persistent allergic asthma in 
adults and adolescents (October 2005 in EU). Inclusion of the paediatric population of 6 to <12 years 
of age for severe persistent allergic asthma was approved in 2009. In the treatment of allergic asthma, 
omalizumab is administered every 2 or 4 weeks, with doses (mg) and dosing frequency determined by 
serum total IgE level (IU/ml) measured pre-treatment, and body weight (kg). Four different approved 
formulations are available for Xolair, i.e., 75 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection, 150 mg 
powder and solvent for solution for injection, 75 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe and 150 
mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe.  
With this variation, the MAH applies for a new therapeutic indication for Xolair (omalizumab) i.e. “Xolair 
is indicated for adults and adolescents (12 years of age and above) with chronic spontaneous urticaria 
refractory to standard of care”.  
The proposed recommended posology is: 
“Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) 
The recommended dose is 300 mg by subcutaneous injection every four weeks. Some patients may 
achieve control of their symptoms with a dose of 150 mg every four weeks. Patients with angioedema 
should be treated with 300 mg every four weeks. 
Xolair II-48 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/137079/2014  
Page 5/84 
 
 
 
 
Prescribers are advised to periodically reassess the need for continued therapy.” 
In this variation only the formulation 150 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection and the 150 
mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe are concerned. 
Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is defined as the occurrence of daily, or almost daily, wheals and 
frequently intractable pruritus (itching) for at least 6 weeks without an obvious cause. Itch is the most 
concerning symptom for patients, and has the greatest impact on their quality of life. Angioedema or 
deep tissue swelling occurs in over 40% of patients with CSU; it is unpredictable and can involve 
swelling anywhere in the body or upper respiratory tract. Swelling of the face, lips or airway is 
particularly uncomfortable and can be very serious for the patients. 
The proposed indication uses the term CSU (as opposed to chronic idiopathic urticaria or CIU) in 
accordance with recent guidelines published by the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical 
Immunology (EAACI). The term chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) was originally essentially synonymous 
with CSU but is now reserved for patients with truly idiopathic aetiology. The term CSU is broader and 
includes patients with a known auto-antibody or prior infection-related chronic urticaria who are not 
now considered ‘idiopathic’, as they do have a known trigger. Thus, in this new classification, CSU 
covers all non-inducible chronic urticaria with CIU (of unknown trigger) being a subset of it. As the 
population studied in the omalizumab clinical studies included patients with auto-antibodies (all were 
tested at baseline), the term CSU most accurately reflects the study population and intended use. 
Scientific advice was sought from European Medicines Agency (EMEA/H/SA/45/3/2009/III, December 
2009) on questions concerning pre-clinical and clinical development of CIU. In the EMA scientific advice 
it was accepted not to conduct further preclinical studies provided the data already available supported 
the clinical development in CIU/CSU. The overall clinical development was discussed and it was agreed 
that the studies should include patients not only unresponsive to H1 antihistamines but also to H1 
antihistamines, plus H2 antihistamines or leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) or a combination of 
all. In addition the placebo control on top of standard of care, the duration of the studies, and the 
endpoints of itch severity, global severity by urticaria activity scores (UAS) for the previous 7 days 
(UAS7), and efficacy of severity and frequency of angioedema attacks were highlighted. The primary 
efficacy endpoint for the Phase III efficacy studies was selected due to comments received from the US 
Food and Drugs Administration (FDA), which advised that this endpoint be based on the itch severity 
component of the UAS7. The use of UAS7 and angioedema as secondary endpoints was also agreed 
with the US FDA in their end of Phase II meeting. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application. As stated by the MAH, the results 
from a complete non-clinical safety program were submitted in 2004, as part of the initial application 
(EMEA/H/C/000606), for the use of omalizumab in patients with severe asthma. Since that time no 
changes in production process or drug substance were made and only minor changes were introduced 
in the formulation to provide prefilled syringes with liquid solution. None of the changes in excipients 
are expected to have any influence on clinical or preclinical safety since all compounds used are 
commonly used excipients in antibody formulations. In addition, the MAH has performed a randomized 
single-center, single blind, three-way cross over study (CSR Q2569g) to evaluate safety and injection 
site reactions associated with two subcutaneous excipient formulations. A similar safety profile was 
identified for the two liquid formulations and no new issues were observed.

The MAH further states that clinical safety data gathered from post-marketing use of omalizumab in 
patients >6 years of age with moderate to severe allergic asthma inadequately controlled with inhaled 
corticosteroids (PSUR 16, 15 Feb 2013), and the data from the clinical studies conducted in patients 
with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) included in this submission (Q4577g, Q3983s, Q3245s and 
CIGE025ADE05) have not identified any new safety issues that would require additional non-clinical 
studies.  
In conclusion, for the reasons outlined above the MAH is not planning to conduct additional non-clinical 
safety studies with omalizumab and no non-clinical safety studies are currently ongoing. 
2.2.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The MAH has submitted an updated summary of environmental risk assessment (ERA) aspects. No 
complete ERA, in accordance with Directive 2001/83/EC and Guideline CHMP/SWP/4447/00, has been 
conducted. The rationale for this is that it can be expected that any omalizumab adsorbed into the 
bloodstream after subcutaneous injection is largely catabolized. As other naturally occurring IgGs, 
proteins or peptides, any omalizumab that reaches water streams via eventual spills during application 
or after disposal of unused drug is expected to be very rapidly consumed by microbes e.g. as 
energy/carbon source or incorporated by them. Accordingly, the MAH does not predict any adverse 
environmental effects from omalizumab. 
2.2.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data were submitted by the MAH. The non-clinical safety package included in the 
initial application (EMEA/H/C/000606) is considered sufficient for the present variation.  
Omalizumab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment, and the new indication sought is not 
considered to increase the environmental risk. 
2.2.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data were submitted by the MAH. The non-clinical safety package included in the 
initial application (EMEA/H/C/000606) is considered sufficient for the present variation. 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of omalizumab.  Considering the above data, omalizumab is not expected 
to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Analytical methods  
Total serum concentrations of omalizumab (NBx-RS602700A)An ELISA method was used for 
determination of total serum concentrations of omalizumab (i.e. the sum of unbound omalizumab and 
omalizumab bound to IgE) in the concentration range of 28 to 1000 ng/ml. 
Free IgE serum concentrations (NBx-RS602700) 
Serum concentrations of free IgE were determined by the use of an ELISA assay in the concentration 
range 2-150 ng/ml. 
Total IgE serum concentrations (NBx-RS630172)The Phadia ImmunoCAP platform was used for 
determination of total IgE serum levels. A cross-validation with the earlier used Abbott Imx platform

was performed. The Lower Limit of Quantification was set to 2 kIU/L (4.84 ng/ml) and the Upper Limit 
of Quantification to 5000 KIU/L (12100 ng/ml). 
Serum levels of anti-omalizumab antibodies (BXSD-R00-011-1560, BXSD-R00-010-1560)Two 
screening ELISA assays were used to detect anti-omalizumab antibodies, one to the Fc and one to the 
Fab component. Sample absorbance was compared to calibrator curve absorbance and samples with 
titer absorbance ≥2 were reported as positive and samples with absorbance <2 reported as <2. 
Exposure 
The pharmacokinetics of omalizumab in patients diagnosed with CIU was evaluated in a randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase II study following a single SC dose (Q4577g). A 
total of 90 patients (randomized approx. 1:1:1:1 ratio) received placebo or 75, 300 or 600 mg 
omalizumab. Blood samples were collected at regular intervals up 112 days post dose and 
pharmacokinetics of omalizumab calculated by non-compartmental analysis. 
The terminal half-life was calculated to about 20 days and the systemic exposure of omalizumab 
increased proportionally with dose in the study dose range 75-600 mg following a single s.c. injection 
(table 1).

2.3.4.   PK/PD modelling 
2.3.4.1.  Analysis of omalizumab PK and IgE response 
The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of omalizumab in patients with CSU were 
described by a target-mediated population PK/PD model incorporating omalizumab−IgE binding and 
turnover. This model had the same structure as the one previously developed for patients with allergic 
asthma.  
Body weight, baseline IgE values, body mass index (BMI), anti-FcεRI autoantibodies (based on the 
Chronic Urticaria [CU] Index) and concomitant use of H2 antihistamines were identified as statistically 
significant covariates on PK/PD model parameters. Body weight and body mass index had modest 
(<26%) effects on omalizumab trough values at Week 12, whereas anti-FcεRI autoantibodies, H2 
antihistamines and baseline IgE had negligible overall effect on omalizumab trough values. Age 
(12−75 years), race/ethnicity, sex, study (study Q4883g vs. others) or the concomitant use of 
leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) were not significant covariates for the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics of omalizumab. 
Xolair II-48 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/137079/2014  
Page 9/84 
 
 
Based on the population PK/PD analysis, the apparent clearance and volume of distribution of free 
omalizumab in a typical CSU patient (with weight of 80 kg, BMI of 30 kg/m2, negative for anti-FCεRI 
autoantibodies and not receiving concomitant H2 antihistamines) were 0.26 L/day and 8.9 L, 
respectively, with modest between-subject variability (≤35%). The apparent equilibrium binding 
constant between omalizumab and free IgE was 2.1 nM in a typical patient (with baseline IgE of 80 
IU/mL). These key PK/PD parameter values were similar to the values for patients with allergic 
asthma.  
2.3.4.2.  Relation between exposure and efficacy 
Exploratory graphical analyses included plots that screened for potential relationships between efficacy 
measures (itch improvement, UAS7 complete responders at Week 12) and dose, exposure 
(omalizumab concentrations at Week 12), and patient characteristics of interest (body weight, body 
mass index [BMI], baseline IgE, angioedema status, and baseline scores).  
There was a clear dose-response relationship in the dose range tested (75 to 300 mg q4w). Within 
each dose level, there seemed to be no effect of body weight, BMI, baseline IgE or angioedema status 
on itch improvement at Week 12. Increased itch score at baseline appeared to result in greater itch 
improvement in both the placebo and treated groups.  
There was a positive relationship between Week 12 itch score improvement and omalizumab 
concentration across the dose range tested, i.e. 75 to 300 mg every 4 weeks (q4w).  
Longitudinal exposure-response modeling 
An exposure-response model including the full itch and hives time course was developed based on the 
three pivotal Phase III studies in patients with CIU/CSU. First, a model describing the time course of 
itch and hives in the placebo arms was developed. Second, a drug effect model was developed 
describing how the omalizumab concentration reduces itch and hives scores with a background time 
course described by the placebo model. In this step, the previously developed PK/IgE model was 
incorporated to predict omalizumab concentrations (by use of empirical Bayes estimates) in each 
patient over the study duration. In this modeling step, the population parameters (fixed effects) for the 
placebo model and the PK/IgE model were fixed. Using only the itch and hives data of treated patients 
from Q4881g, Q4882g and Q4883g, but retaining the PK and IgE data, the drug effect population-
typical parameters were estimated.  
Placebo response was described using an exponential decay function while drug effect was described 
using an indirect response model. The drug can reduce the itch or hives scores up to an amount Emax 
depending on a latent response variable EFF. This response variable takes a value of 1 if no drug is 
present and turns over with a rate which is the reciprocal of the drug mean response time (XRT). The 
concentration of omalizumab inhibits the production of the response variable via a sigmoidal function 
with an EC50 and Hill coefficient (γ). A reduction of the response variable leads to an increase in the 
fraction of the maximal effect Emax which is subtracted from the score due to placebo, natural history 
or disease progression. 
The model fit is exemplified by the overlay of time courses of model predictions and mean itch. The 
increased quantity of data for the time course analysis increased the precision of the EC50 estimates 
compared with the Week 12 data analyses (95% confidence interval was 15-16 μg/mL from the time 
course model compared with 9.8-43 μg/mL for itch). A Hill coefficient of 7.52 was estimated. The 
estimated EC50 values and Hill coefficient translated into a dynamic range of approximately 12 to 20 
μg/ml within which the effect increased from 10% to 90% of the maximal effect for both itch and 
hives.

Body weight and BMI, which were highly correlated, acted together and in opposition to the effect on 
the pharmacokinetics, such that in patients with higher body weights the drug appears more potent 
(lower EC50). Furthermore, although higher body weight gave a higher Emax, this was countered by 
an opposing effect of BMI. As a result, there was no net effect of body weight nor BMI on clinical 
responses. 
Baseline IgE was also statistically significant, increasing Emax with higher IgE levels. The presence of 
angioedema at baseline had a statistically significant effect on the drug response time, being 20% 
shorter in patients presenting with angioedema (i.e. 3.7 days compared with 4.7 days in patients 
without angioedema). The angioedema status did not, however, affect the drug potency (EC50). Of 
note, adolescent patients with an age less than 18 had 55% higher EC50 than adult patients. 
Simulations of time to effect steady state, tapering and longer dosing intervals 
Simulations of different scenarios were performed using 632 individual patients’ parameters. For a 
posology of 300 mg q4w, clinical response steady-state is reached sooner than pharmacokinetic 
steady-state due to concentrations approaching saturation of the response (Emax). For 150 mg the 
approach to clinical response steady-state is slower and parallels pharmacokinetic equilibration. 
Taking both up and down titration simulations together suggested that an initial dose of 300 mg to 
control symptoms followed by adaptive down then up titration based upon symptom control, should 
result in the same symptom control as a fixed 300 mg q4w posology but with a proportion of patients 
receiving 150 mg q4w. Calculations showed that if dose adaptation based upon complete control 
(predicted UAS7<1) at 1, 2 and 3 months were carried out, the well-controlled responder rate from a 
fixed 300 mg q4w posology could be matched, but with 27-38% of patients receiving 150 mg. 
With 300 mg and longer dosing intervals than 4 weekly a proportion of the patients will likely show 
relapses of symptoms before their next treatment. There is, however a fraction of patients for whom 
longer intervals may suffice. 
These simulation exercises show that potentially, individual patient dosage could be changed based 
upon itch and hive symptom control. 
2.3.4.3.  Exposure-Safety Analyses 
The relationship between safety endpoints and exposure, i.e. omalizumab trough concentration at 
Week 12, based on pooled data from all three Phase 3 studies (Q4881g, Q4882g, and Q4883g), was 
analysed by the MAH. In particular, the MAH looked at treatment-emergent adverse events versus 
omalizumab trough concentrations at Week 12 for any adverse event, any serious adverse event or 
any severe adverse event during the treatment period  
Visual inspection of the 95% confidence intervals of the above data  showed no difference in these 
adverse event rates across omalizumab exposure quartiles, although there were few serious or severe 
adverse events observed from all studies (hence wide confidence intervals). Overall, no increased 
adverse event rates were observed in patients with higher exposure to omalizumab in the dose range 
tested. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Population modeling show that the PK of omalizumab and the PD in terms of IgE response is similar for 
patients with CSU compared to patients with asthma. 
There is a clear correlation between dose and response. The relation between omalizumab exposure 
and the primary endpoint seems to reach a plateau above a trough concentration of 40 ug/mL.

The development of an advanced model to describe the full time course of response and the effect of 
drug exposure and covariates is acknowledged. To exemplify, the precision in the estimate of EC50 is 
vastly improved compared to the model including only base line and Week 12 data. As a result from 
the exercise the model predictions and simulation of different scenarios become more reliable and 
useful.  
For further validation of the simulation approach, visual predictive checks (VPCs) were produced during 
the assessment which compared the repeated simulations with observed time courses of itch and hives 
scores as well as well-controlled responder rates (defined as the fraction of patients with UAS7≤6). For 
the simulations, all patients from the three phase III studies treated with omalizumab were pooled and 
their estimated individual parameters sampled for the simulations. The number of sampled patients per 
simulation was chosen to be equal to the number of patients in the dataset to which the simulation 
was compared to. 
In summary, these diagnostic plots indicated that discriminating the placebo and the drug effect in the 
active treatment groups is challenging leading to an under-prediction of the placebo effect. This may 
also explain why the simulations for 75 mg under-predict the treatment response since for this dose 
the contribution of the placebo effect is larger than for the higher doses. Simulations for 150 mg q4w 
under-predicted the well-controlled responder rates for the first dose by up to 10 percentage points, 
but provided valid predictions for subsequent doses. Simulations for doses of 300 mg every q4w 
provided valid predictions for the entire treatment period as well as the follow-up period. 
In the view of the CHMP, the model is able to reasonably predict the response following 300 mg q4w 
but is less reliable for prediction of response to 75 mg q4w. Since the dosing recommendation is 
revised to only include the 300 mg q4w dose, the issue is of less importance. The MAH is 
recommended to further develop the model for future applications. 
Simulations from the exposure-response model indicate that 300 mg gives a more rapid achievement 
of effect as compared to 150 mg. Further, dose adaptation based on clinical effect could be an option 
for patients with well controlled symptoms. Simulations suggest that such adaptive dosing regimen 
could lead to approximately 1/3 of the patients receiving adequate response with the 150 mg dose. 
However, such adaptive regimen has not been clinically tested. 
The number of patients below 18 years of age in the three Phase III studies was low: 10 on placebo 
and 11 on 300 mg omalizumab. Therefore the modeling results should be interpreted with caution with 
respect to this group. The estimated EC50 was 55% higher in adolescents which indicate the possibility 
that PKPD is different in this population. 
As for the adolescents, the number of elderly subjects is small. Since there is an indication that PKPD 
may be different in adolescents, a similar analysis (within the PKPD model) for the elderly was 
performed as requested by the CHMP. 
EC50 as well as Emax (maximum effect) for itch and hives improvements were respectively 20- 24% 
and 15% lower in elderly patients as compared to patients < 65 years. However, the majority (at least 
75%) of elderly patients treated with 300 mg q4w had omalizumab trough levels above the EC90 in 
elderly, similar to the results for patients < 65 years. Simulations of well-controlled responder rates 
suggested that the differences in EC50 and Emax are unlikely to result in relevant differences in the 
clinical response in elderly patients.  
The CHMP noted that at the proposed dose level, 300 mg q4w, elderly patients seem to achieve 
efficacious trough plasma concentration levels. Therefore, no clinically meaningful difference is 
expected in the PKPD in this population.

The PK/PD analysis in CSU seems based on a limited number of samples for subjects <70 kg or > 100 
kg body-weight, thus subject to a great variability and poor sensitivity to detect changes in response 
according to body weight. Further to the request by the CHMP, the MAH showed that about 30% of 
patients included in the PK/PD model had a body weight below 70 kg (n=247) and about 20% (n= 
151) had a body weight above 100 kg, which the CHMP deems sufficient for estimating the impact of 
body weight in all body weight categories. Simulations of well-controlled responder rates (UAS7≤6) for 
300 mg q4w show overlapping 95% prediction intervals for the body weight categories <70 kg, 
between 70 and 100 kg and >100 kg, suggesting similar efficacy in all body weight groups. There was 
no indication that adolescent patients should have a different dose-response relationship because they 
weigh less. Therefore, the CHMP concludes that no dose-adjustment by body-weight is deemed 
necessary. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of omalizumab and the IgE pharmacodynamic response to treatment has been 
adequately characterized in patients with CSU. Simulations from a exposure-response model of the 
time course of symptoms indicate that 300 mg gives a more rapid achievement of effect as compared 
to 150 mg.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The assessment of efficacy in the sought indication is based on the phase II/III studies: a phase II 
dose finding study Q4577g, and three pivotal phase III studies, Q4881g, Q4882g and Q4883g. Study 
Q4883g was designed primarily for the evaluation of safety, and so no primary efficacy endpoint was 
designed. However, the same efficacy analyses were performed as in the other pivotal Phase III 
studies. Supportive efficacy data are provided by one study performed using a different dose regimen 
to the Phase II/III program (Study IGE025ADE05). 
The submitted studies for the CSU indication are presented in section 2.3.1 of this assessment report. 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
The dose response was explored in study Q4577g using a single dose, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, parallel-group design, comparing the efficacy of 75 mg, 300 mg and 600 mg single 
doses of omalizumab and placebo in patients 12-75 years old (18-75 years in centres in Germany) with 
chronic idiopathic urticaria who remained symptomatic despite H1 antihistamine treatment (N=90 with 
21-25 subjects per treatment arm).  Patients were followed up for a total of 16 weeks after dosing: the 
first 4 weeks (corresponding to the dosing interval for omalizumab) were referred to as the treatment 
period, with the endpoint for efficacy at Week 4.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline to Week 4 in UAS7 in the ITT population, 
analysed using last observation carried forward (LOCF) if a patient’s Week 4 diary data were 
completely missing.  
Mean decreases from baseline were 6.91 in the placebo group, and 9.79, 19.93 and 14.56 in the 
omalizumab 75 mg, 300 mg and 600 mg groups, respectively. The differences to placebo were 
statistically significant for the 300 mg and 600 mg omalizumab groups (p = 0.0003 and p = 0.0473, 
respectively; p-values were based on the van Elteren test stratified by baseline weight ≥80 or <80 kg). 
The secondary efficacy endpoints change from baseline to Week 4 in weekly itch score and weekly hive 
score showed a similar pattern to UAS7. For change from baseline to Week 4 in weekly sleep 
disturbance score, while all omalizumab groups showed greater decreases than placebo, the between-
group difference was largest for the 600 mg group. There were no major differences between any 
omalizumab group and placebo in rescue medication use.

Evaluate The Efficacy and Safety of Xolair (Omalizumab) in Patients With Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria 
(CIU) Who Remain Symptomatic Despite Antihistamine Treatment (H1). 
Study Q4881g was randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre studies, 
comparing the efficacy of omalizumab 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg, given every 4 weeks (treatment 
duration: 24 weeks) with placebo in patients 12 to 75 years of age (18 to 75 years in Germany) with 
CSU who were symptomatic despite treatment with H1 antihistamines. 
The study consisted of three distinct periods over 42 weeks: 
•  Screening period: Day -14 to Day -1 
• 
• 
Treatment Period: Day 1 to Day 169 (Week 0 to Week 24) 
Follow up Period: Day 169 to Day 281 (Week 24 to Week 40)

Title: A Phase III, Multicentre, Randomized, Double-Blind, Dose-Ranging, Placebo-Controlled Study To 
Evaluate The Efficacy, Response Duration And Safety of Xolair® (Omalizumab) in Patients With Chronic 
Idiopathic Urticaria (CIU) Who Remain Symptomatic Despite Antihistamine Treatment (H1). 
Study Q4882g was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre studies, 
comparing the efficacy of omalizumab 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg, given every 4 weeks (treatment 
duration: 12 weeks) with placebo in patients 12 to 75 years of age (18 to 75 years in Germany) with 
CSU who were symptomatic despite treatment with H1 antihistamines. 
The study consisted of three distinct periods over 30 weeks: 
• Screening period: Day − 14 to Day −1 
• Treatment Period: Day 1 to Day 85 (Week 0 to Week 12) 
• Follow-Up Period: Day 85 to Day 197 (Week 12 to Week 28) 
The primary endpoint was measured at Week 12. After the 12-week treatment period, all patients 
entered a 16-week follow-up period to allow for further characterization of the PK and PD of 
omalizumab, collection of additional efficacy and safety data, and evaluation of the presence of anti-
therapeutic antibodies (ATAs). Patients continued to visit the study centre at 4-week intervals. No 
study treatment was given; patients were required to maintain stable doses of their prerandomization 
CIU H1 antihistamine treatment. 
Study Q4883g 
Title: A Phase III, Multicentre, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Safety Study of Xolair 
(Omalizumab) in Patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria (CIU) Who Remain Symptomatic Despite 
Treatment With H1 Antihistamines, H2 Blockers, and/or Leukotriene Receptor Antagonists 
Study Q4883g was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre study, 
designed to assess the safety of omalizumab 300 mg given every 4 weeks (treatment duration 24 
weeks) in patients 12 to 75 years of age (18-75 years in Germany) with CSU who were symptomatic 
despite treatment with H1 antihistamines at increased doses and either or both H2 antihistamines or 
LTRAs. 
The primary endpoint was measured at Week 12. Patients were required to maintain stable doses of 
their pre-randomization combination therapy with H1 antihistamine treatment, and either H2 blockers 
or LTRAs, or all three drugs in combination throughout the 24-week treatment period and 16-week 
follow-up period of the 40-week study. For the duration of the 40-week study, all patients were 
provided with diphenhydramine 25 mg for itch relief on an as needed basis, up to a maximum of three 
doses in ≤ 24 hours. Following the 24-week treatment period, patients entered a 16-week follow-up 
period for further characterization of omalizumab PK-PD, collection of additional safety and efficacy 
data, and evaluation for the presence of anti-therapeutic antibodies (ATAs).

The primary efficacy endpoint and many of the secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints were 
collected via the Urticaria Patient Daily Diary (UPDD) with an electronic handheld device (eDiary).  
The UPDD questions consist of itch severity, number of hives, size of largest hive, sleep interference, 
daily active interference, rescue medication use, angioedema episodes and management, and health 
care provider contact for CIU. The eDiary was completed twice per day by the patient for the duration 
of the study. The eDiary was given to the patient at the Day - 14 visit. The itch severity score was 
recorded twice daily (morning and evening) in the patient eDiary, on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe). 
The daily itch severity score was the average of the morning and evening scores. The number of hives 
was recorded twice daily and scored on a scale of 0 (none), 1 (1 to 6 hives), 2 (7 to 12 hives), or 3 
(>12 hives). The UAS, as a composite of the itch and hives scores, could therefore range from 0 to 6. 
The UAS is commonly analysed as a weekly score (UAS7), which is the sum of the UAS scores for the 
Xolair II-48

previous 7 days, and could range from 0 to 42. Weekly scores for itch and hives were the sums of the 
respective daily scores over the previous 7 days, and in each case could range from 0 to 21. 
Sample size 
Studies Q4881g and Q4882g 
The sample size for studies Q4881g and Q4882g was primarily based on safety and regulatory 
considerations. The estimation of power for efficacy assumed a mean change from baseline in the 
weekly itch severity score at Week 12 to be 9 points and 3.5 points for the omalizumab and placebo 
groups, respectively, with a common SD of 6 points. A total of 300 patients (1:1:1:1 randomization 
ratio with 75 patients in each treatment group) were to be included in each study. 
Study Q4883g 
The sample size for this study was primarily based on safety and regulatory considerations. 
Approximately 320 patients were planned for randomization to either the omalizumab (300 mg) or 
placebo treatment groups in a 3:1 ratio. Combining the patients in the omalizumab group in this study 
with those in its CIU sister studies (Studies Q4881g and Q4882g) was expected to provide a safety 
database with at least 300 patients treated with omalizumab 300 mg for 24 weeks. 
Randomisation 
Q4881g and Q4882g 
On the Day 1 visit, patients were randomized to one of 3 doses of omalizumab (75 mg, 150 mg, or 300 
mg) or placebo at an approximately 1:1:1:1 ratio using an IxRS. 
Q4883g 
At the Day 1 visit, patients were randomized to receive either omalizumab 300 mg or placebo in a 3:1 
ratio, through use of an IxRS. 
Q4881g, Q4882g and Q4883g 
Within the Phase III studies, patient randomization was stratified by baseline weekly itch severity score 
(< 13, ≥13), baseline weight (< 80 kg, ≥80 kg), and by study site. A hierarchical dynamic 
randomization scheme was used to achieve overall balance between treatment groups and within 
strata. The levels in this hierarchy were overall study treatment balance, treatment balance within the 
baseline weekly itch severity score strata (<13, ≥ 13), treatment balance within the body weight 
strata (< 80 kg, ≥ 80 kg), and balance within each study centre. 
The goal was to achieve an approximate balance with respect to the overall treatment balance and the 
stratification factors whilst at the same time preserving enough randomness in the process. 
Re-randomization tests for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were performed using 
computer simulations. The simulation study re-randomized the patients (319 patients for study 
Q4881g, 323 patients for study Q4882g and 336 patients for study Q4883g) 10,000 times with use of 
the same randomization stratification factors observed in the study, (i.e., baseline weekly itch severity 
score strata (<13, ≥ 13), body weight strata (< 80 kg, ≥ 80 kg), and study centre). The analyses of 
the primary and secondary efficacy endpoint were conducted for each of the re-randomized patient 
cohorts. The test statistics generated by the simulation cohorts were used to generate a “re-
randomization distribution” for each of the endpoints. A p-value was then computed as the proportion 
of simulated test statistics that exceeded the observed test statistic for each endpoint. The p-values 
obtained by the re-randomization simulations were similar to the model-based p-values for all 
endpoints, which demonstrate the robustness of the model-based results.

Blinding (masking) 
Patients, all study personnel, the designated evaluating physician(s), the Sponsor and its agents (with 
the exception of the IxRS service provider, the remote unblinded monitoring staff, the unblinding 
statistician, the unblended pharmacists at the sites, the iDMC members and the independent Data 
Coordinating Center [iDCC] personnel) were blinded to treatment assignment. Only the IxRS provider, 
the Sponsor’s unblinding statistician, and the iDCC statistician had access to the unblinding code during 
the study. 
Study drug supplies were shipped blinded to each site. Each centre identified an individual responsible 
(e.g., pharmacist) for the reconstitution procedures. This individual prepared the study drug for each 
patient prior to administration. An individual not involved with evaluating the patient was identified to 
administer the study drug. To minimize risk of potential bias arising from access to laboratory results 
that could potentially unblind treatment assignments (e.g., free IgE levels and serum omalizumab 
concentrations), access to these results were withheld from the site and the Sponsor until study 
completion. 
Statistical methods 
Study Q4883g 
The analysis of safety consisted primarily of descriptive summaries. No formal statistical testing was 
performed on the safety endpoints. The evaluation of efficacy was a secondary objective for this study. 
Efficacy was analysed similarly as for studies Q4881g and Q4882g described below with the exception 
of the type I error control plan which were not applicable since this study only had two treatment 
groups. 
Studies Q4881g and Q4882g 
Modified ITT population was used for efficacy analyses. This population included all patients 
randomized in the study who received at least one dose of study drug. The treatment group for this 
population was defined according to the treatment assigned at randomization. 
Treatment comparisons were performed between each of the omalizumab groups (75 mg, 150 mg, and 
300 mg) and the placebo group. All statistical tests were two-sided using an overall 0.05 level of 
significance and adjustments for multiple comparisons were performed according to the type I error 
control plan using a hierarchical order. 
Primary analysis: 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in the weekly itch severity score at Week 
12. The analysis of this endpoint consisted of treatment comparisons between each of the omalizumab 
groups (75 mg, 150 mg, and 300 mg) and the placebo group using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), 
controlling for baseline weekly itch severity score (< 13 vs. ≥ 13), and baseline weight (< 80 kg vs. ≥ 
80 kg). A separate ANCOVA model was run for each omalizumab dose group versus placebo. The least 
squares means (LSM) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the differences between 
each of the omalizumab groups and the placebo group are presented along with the p-values for 
treatment differences resulting from the ANCOVA model. 
Handling of missing data: 
For change from baseline weekly score endpoints analysed at particular time points (e.g., Week 12, 
Week 24, or Week 40 in study Q4881g and Week 12 or Week 28 in study Q4882g), missing post-
baseline weekly scores were imputed using the baseline weekly score (BOCF). In addition, for 
summaries by study week, the weekly scores were imputed using BOCF. 
Xolair II-48 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/137079/2014  
Page 23/84 
 
 
For endpoints that consist of proportions of responders analysed at a particular time point (e.g., Week 
12, Week 24, or Week 40 in study Q4881g and Week 12 or Week 28 in study Q4882g), patients with 
missing weekly scores for the given week were classified as non-responders. 
For time to the first event endpoints, the endpoint were considered censored at the week of the last 
non-missing weekly score in the absence of the event. In addition, it was assumed that an event did 
not occur during a week with a missing weekly score that occurs between baseline and a study week 
with a non-missing weekly score. 
Sensitivity analyses: 
The following sensitivity analyses were performed on the primary endpoint: 
•  An ANCOVA model was fitted which is similar to the primary analysis but imputes missing 
Week 12 weekly itch severity scores by the method of last observation carry forward (LOCF). 
•  A mixed effects model was fitted which included all observed weekly itch severity scores from 
baseline to Week 12. No imputation was applied to those weeks with a missing weekly itch 
severity score. 
•  An ANCOVA model was fitted, which was similar to the primary analysis but imputed the Week 
12 weekly itch severity score by carrying forward the baseline weekly itch severity score 
(BOCF) for patients who received any systemic steroids for any reason during the 2 weeks 
prior to the Week 12 visit. 
Control of type I error: 
In order to maintain an overall type I error rate of 0.05 (two-sided) across the three omalizumab dose 
levels, the testing of the primary endpoint were conducted in hierarchical order starting with the 
highest dose group. 
A hierarchical analysis of the following secondary endpoints was then performed for each dose found to 
be significant in the primary endpoint. The hierarchical analysis of the secondary endpoints was 
performed independently for each dose level.

10 March 2011/27 Jun 2012 
21 Feb 2011/22 Nov 2012 
There was one amendment to the protocol, dated 11 January 2011. 
The major changes concerned: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The number of weeks that a patient must have had CIU symptoms despite being on H1 
antihistamines was increased from 6 to 8 weeks. 
The secondary objectives were clarified to indicate that a goal of this study was to provide 
information regarding the recurrence of disease/symptoms after withdrawal of omalizumab in 
patients with refractory CIU. Secondary and exploratory endpoints were modified as a result. 
Procedures regarding the use of excluded therapy were modified in an effort to continue to 
follow patients for safety evaluation after they had discontinued study drug treatment. 
The washout period required after regular doxepin use prior to enrolment was reduced from 6 
weeks to 14 days. 
Study Q4882g 
There was one amendment to the protocol, dated 11 January 2011. 
The major changes concerned: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The second treatment period (STP), including the re-randomization portion, was removed. The 
study duration was 12 weeks shorter as a result. Secondary endpoints were either removed or 
modified to reflect this change. 
The planned number of patients within each treatment group was changed from 80 in the 
omalizumab treatment groups and 60 in the placebo group to 75 per group. The total number 
of approximately 300 patients in the study remained unchanged. 
The number of weeks that a patient must have had CIU symptoms despite being on H1 
antihistamines was increased from 6 to 8 weeks. 
The secondary objectives were clarified to indicate that a goal of this study was to provide 
information regarding the recurrence of disease/symptoms after withdrawal of omalizumab in

Baseline data 
Studies Q4881g and Q4882g 
In both studies demographic characteristics were broadly well-balanced across treatment groups, 
although in Q4881g the proportion of white patients was higher in the omalizumab 300 mg group than 
other treatment groups. The study populations were both predominantly female and white, and there 
were few patients less than 18 years or more than 64 years of age.

In both studies Q4881g and Q4882g the treatment groups were similar with respect to baseline 
disease characteristics. Baseline mean UAS7 was approximately 31 (out of a possible 42) in both 
studies, and mean in-clinic UAS was over 5 (of a possible 6). Baseline itch severity scores were >13 
(of a possible 21) in more than half of the patients in both studies. The mean duration of disease was 
between 6 and 7 years in each study, with a very wide range, from 6 months (the minimum required 
for entry) to over 66 years. Angioedema was present in over 40% of patients in both studies; this was 
based on a narrow definition, namely the presence of angioedema during the week prior to 
randomization. Baseline mean DLQI values ranging from 12.6 to 14.0. 
The mean number of prior medications for urticaria was over 4 in both studies, and over 70% of 
patients had received at least 3 prior medications and indicating that the populations were refractory 
to current standard therapies. The most common prior medications in both studies were non-sedating 
antihistamines, and almost 30% of patients in Q4881g and over 20% in Q4882g had been treated with 
the sedating antihistamine diphenhydramine. Approximately 26% of patients in each study had prior 
LTRA treatment and 44% of patients had previously received systemic corticosteroids to treat their 
CSU. CSU medications in use at baseline were most commonly non-sedating antihistamines, most 
frequently cetirizine, fexofenadine, loratadine, levocetirizine, and desloratadine. 
Study Q4883g  
In Study Q4883g, the treatment groups were well balanced in terms of baseline demographic 
characteristics (Table 7). Mean age was 43.1 years, with only 11 patients (3.3%) 12-<18 years old, 
and 21 (6.3%) over 64 years of age. Most patients were female and white.

*Based on data collected in patient daily eDiary in the week before randomization 
In Study Q4883g the mean duration of CIU at baseline was 7.4 years (median 3.6 years), and patients 
reported using an average of six medications to treat their CIU. Patients had a mean baseline UAS7 of 
30.9 (range, 16.0−42.0) and a mean baseline weekly itch severity score, a component of the UAS7, of 
14.0 (range, 7.5−21.0). The mean score for the physician assessed in-clinic UAS was 5.2 (range, 4−6). 
Angioedema was present in 49-54% of patients. Baseline mean DLQI values (13.0 in the placebo 
group and 13.8 in the omalizumab treated group.  
In Study Q4883g the greatest percentage of patients were taking H1 antihistamines and H2 blockers 
only (55.5%) to manage their CIU, followed by patients who were taking H1 antihistamines, and H2 
antihistamines and LTRAs in combination (26.6%), patients taking H1 antihistamines and LTRAs 
(14.0%), and patients taking other combinations of medications (3.9%). With respect to the use of H1 
antihistamines, the majority of patients were taking either the standard approved dose (37.4%) or two 
times the approved dose (35.3%), followed by patients taking up to three times (11.2%) or four times 
(16.1%) the approved dose of H1 antihistamines. Regarding the non-sedating H1 antihistamines 30% 
of patients had used the sedating antihistamine diphenhydramine. The use of H2 blockers was also 
very common (in 89% of patients), as was LTRA use (58% of patients). A total of 58% of patients had 
prior use of steroids to treat CSU, and 7% of patients had prior use of cyclosporine. The two treatment 
groups in Q4883g were generally similar in terms of baseline disease characteristics, although the 
duration of disease was slightly longer in the placebo group, and a higher proportion of placebo 
patients were using H1 antihistamines at 2 x standard dose at baseline.

•  Change from baseline in weekly number of hives score at Week 12 
Change from baseline in weekly number of hives score at Week 12 show that there was an observed 
difference between placebo and 300 mg omalizumab of -6.93, -7.09 and -5.90 in studies Q4881g, 
Q4882g, and Q4883g, respectively. 
•  Time to minimally important difference (MID) response in weekly itch severity score 
by Week 12 
In studies Q4881g and Q4882g, median time to MID response was 1 week in the 300 mg groups, and 
2 weeks in the 150 mg groups, compared with 4 weeks in the placebo groups. 
•  Proportion of patients with UAS7 ≤ 6 at Week 12 
In the studies, the proportion of patients with UAS7 <= 6 at Week 12 were 11-19%, 26-27%, 40-43% 
and 52-66% in the placebo, 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg dose groups, respectively. Statistically 
significant vales were observed for the 150 mg and 300 mg doses.   
•  Proportion of weekly itch severity score MID responders at Week 12 
In the studies, the proportion of weekly itch severity score MID responders (decrease of at least 5 
points) at Week 12 were 36-48%, 56%, 56-70% and 70-79% in the placebo, 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 
mg dose groups, respectively. Statistically significant vales were observed for the 150 mg and 300 mg 
doses.   
•  Change from baseline in weekly size of largest hive score at Week 12 
Change from baseline in weekly size of largest hives score at Week 12 show that there was an 
observed difference in LS means between placebo and 300 mg omalizumab of -5.73, -7.15 and -5.61 
in studies Q4881g, Q4882g, and Q4883g, respectively. 
•  Change from baseline in health-related quality-of-life as measured by the 
Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) at Week 12 
In all three studies, the change from baseline to Week 12 in overall DLQI was statistically significantly 
greater for the 300 mg omalizumab group than for placebo. For the 150 mg omalizumab group the 
difference to placebo only achieved statistical significance in one study.

The mean proportion of angioedema-free days from Week 4 to Week 12 was 88-89% in the placebo 
groups across the studies, and in all three studies, the mean proportion of angioedema-free days was 
highest in the 300 mg omalizumab group with means in the 300 mg groups of 96% (p<0.0001 vs. 
placebo) in both Q4881g and Q4882g, and 91% (p=0.0006) in Q4883g. The 75 mg and 150 mg 
omalizumab groups did not show statistically significant differences to placebo. 
Table 10 - Proportion of angioedema-free days from Week 4 to Week 12, mITT population, 
Studies Q4881g, Q4882g, Q4883g 
1p−value is derived from stratified Wilcoxon test. Stratification variables are presence of angioedema at baseline 
(Yes vs. No) and baseline weight (< 80 kg vs. >= 80 kg) 
The proportion of angioedema−free days from Week 4 to Week 12 is defined as the number of days for 
which the patient indicated a ‘No’ response to the angioedema question in the daily diary divided by 
the total number of days with a non−missing diary entry starting on the Week 4 visit date and ending 
the day prior to the Week 12 visit date. Patients who withdrew before the Week 4 visit or who have 
missing responses for > 40% of the daily diary entries between the Week 4 study visit and the Week 
12 study visit were not included in this analysis. 
•  Proportion of patients with UAS7=0 at Week 12 
In all three studies (Q4881g, Q4882g and Q4883g), the 300 mg dose group consistently achieved a 
higher complete responder rate, (for total symptom control over 7 days, defined as the proportion of 
patients with a UAS7 of zero of 33.7 to 44.3%). The difference relative to placebo was statistically 
significant across the three studies.  The corresponding values for placebo, the 75 mg dose and the 
150 mg dose groups were 5-9%, 12-16% and 15-22%, respectively. The 75 and 150 mg doses did not 
achieve statistical significance for this endpoint in the pivotal studies. 
Long term efficacy data 
Studies Q4881g and Q4883g provided 24-week efficacy data. The results in the changes from baseline 
to Week 24 are presented below.

In both studies, the 300 mg omalizumab group showed changes from baseline at Week 24 that were 
similar to those at Week 12 for all secondary endpoints assessed, and for the responder analysis for 
patients with UAS7 ≤6 or UAS=0. From 12 to 24 weeks there was a sustained response observed for 
the 300 mg omalizumab dose in studies Q4881g and Q4883g. The Week 24 efficacy data showed no 
tolerance to treatment developing, and indicates that the efficacy of omalizumab is sustainable over 
the longer-term.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Pooled analysis 
Pooled analyses of efficacy data from studies Q4881g and Q4882g were performed. With the exception 
of treatment period duration, studies Q4881g and Q4882g had identical inclusion and exclusion 
criteria, treatment frequency, study assessments, and efficacy endpoints. The results are shown below.

Subgroup analysis 
Change from baseline to Week 12 in weekly itch severity score was analysed in the pooled population 
of studies Q4881g and Q4882g in a range of subgroups defined according to baseline demographic and 
disease characteristics, or according to prior CSU treatments. Additional subgroup analyses for other 
endpoints were undertaken in subgroups defined by the presence or absence of angioedema at 
baseline. 
Demographic factors 
The results for the subgroup analysis defined by demographic factors are presented below.

Adolescents 
For the <18 years subgroup, a post hoc analysis was performed for the primary endpoint using a 
mixed effect model for the repeated measurement (MMRM). This analysis was based on the pooled 
Q4881g and Q4882g studies, and included a total of 25 patients. For week 12, the following treatment 
differences in LS means (vs placebo) -0.57, -2.22 and -1.65 was observed for the 75 mg, 150 mg and 
300 mg dose, respectively. The result was not statistically significant.

Previous CSU therapies 
Subgroups defined by prior medications, i.e., previous use of systemic steroids for CIU and previous 
number of CIU (i.e. CSU) medications, were analysed.  
Patients with and without previous use of systemic steroids for CSU showed similar responses in terms 
of differences to placebo in changes in weekly itch severity score. 
For each of the subgroups based on previous number of CSU medications (≤ 2, 3−5, >5) there was a 
dose response, with differences to placebo being larger with increasing omalizumab dose. Patients with 
≤ 2 previous medications showed smaller differences to placebo, at each omalizumab dose level, than 
in the two subgroups with more previous medications. 
For Study Q4883g, additional subgroup analyses were performed based on previous CSU therapies.   
Supportive study(ies) 
Study IGE025ADE05 
Study IGE025ADE05 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre 
study, comparing the efficacy of omalizumab with placebo in patients aged 18-70 years with chronic 
urticaria who were symptomatic despite treatment with H1 antihistamines, and who had specific IgE 
against thyroperoxidase. Treatment duration was 24 weeks. Omalizumab was administered according 
to the approved dosing table for allergic asthma, with doses ranging from 75 to 375 mg, given 2-, or 
4- weekly, according to the patients’ body weight and baseline IgE level. A total of 27 patients were 
randomized to omalizumab and 22 to placebo. Baseline demographic characteristics were broadly 
similar across the treatment groups, although the placebo group had a higher proportion (86.4%) of 
female patients than the omalizumab group (70.4%). All patients were white, the mean age of the 
population as a whole was 40.5 years. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from screening to 
Week 24 in UAS7. The LS mean decrease was 7.9 in the placebo group and 17.8 in the omalizumab 
group: the difference of 9.9 was statistically significant (p = 0.0089). Secondary efficacy parameters 
also showed greater improvements in the omalizumab group than the placebo group. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The clinical development program included one phase 2 study (dose response, completed) and three 
phase 3 studies (all completed). The assessment of efficacy is mainly based on the three pivotal phase 
III studies, Q4881g, Q4882g and Q4883g. Study Q4883g was designed primarily for the evaluation of 
safety, and so no primary efficacy endpoint was designed. However, the same efficacy analyses were 
performed as in the other pivotal Phase III studies.  
The three pivotal studies were all randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled and multicentre 
studies.  The efficacy of 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg were explored in studies Q4881g and Q4882g and 
the 300 mg was explored in study 4883g. The study duration was 24 weeks in two studies (Q4881g, 
Q4883g) and 12 weeks in one study (Q4882g), and all studies had a 16 week follow up time to 
evaluate symptom recurrence.  
The time point for the evaluation of the primary/key efficacy endpoint was at week 12 in all studies. 
The long term efficacy was assessed at 24 weeks in two of the studies which is considered reasonable.  
The primary objective of the pivotal Phase 3 studies was to demonstrate the efficacy of omalizumab in 
patients with “refractory CIU” receiving concomitant H1 antihistamine therapy at currently approved 
doses (studies Q4881g and Q4882g) , or receiving concomitant H1 antihistamine therapy (up to four

times the approved dose), and H2 antihistamines and/or leukotriene receptor antagonists, LTRAs 
(Q4883g). Approximately 40-50% of the patients enrolled had angioedema at baseline. 
In accordance with a recent guideline published by the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical 
Immunology (EAACI) (Zuberbier et al 2009a, Zuberbier et al 2009b),  the term chronic idiopathic 
urticaria (CIU) has recently been reserved for patients with truly idiopathic aetiology. In this new 
classification, CSU covers all non-inducible chronic urticaria with CIU (of unknown trigger) being a 
subset of it. As the population studied in the omalizumab clinical studies included patients with auto-
antibodies (all were tested at baseline), the term CSU most accurately reflects the study population 
and intended use. The conclusion of the MAH to use CSU is supported in particular when considering 
the patient population included in the studies. 
In general, the design and the conduct of the studies seem appropriate and are in line with the 
recommendations given in the centralised scientific advice (EMEA/H/SA/45/3/2009/III).  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In the mITT population, the majority of all patients were Caucasian. More females (approximately 
70%) than men, and the majority of the subjects were between 18-64 years. There were few patients 
in the < 18 years (39 (4.0%) children between 12 to 17 years old were included in the studies) and ≥ 
65 years subgroups, there were 10 patients or fewer per treatment group.  
Additional analyses were provided by the MAH correlating decrease in free IgE, expressed as the 
fraction of IgE at baseline (i.e. if relative rather than absolute free IgE levels), with AS7 improvement 
(reduction from baseline).  In addition, relative free IgE levels are inversely correlated with 
omalizumab concentrations. Therefore, this analysis underpins the primary pharmacological action of 
omalizumab, i.e. binding to IgE and thus reduction of free IgE levels. The MAH believed that there is 
no need for another PD study on the mode of action of omalizumab in patients with CSU, which is 
endorsed by the CHMP. The information on PD proposed for section 5.1 of the omalizumab SmPC in 
CSU is deemed appropriate.  
The results of the primary efficacy endpoint, change from baseline in the weekly itch severity score, 
show that at Week 12, there was an observed difference between placebo and 300 mg omalizumab of  
-5.80, -4.81 and – 4.52 in studies Q4881g, Q4882g, and Q4883g, respectively. The difference is 
statistically significant and is considered clinically relevant. Minimal important differences (MIDs) with 
respect to changes in individual patients have been defined for the composite score and its 
components and the MID ranges from 4.5 to 5.0 for weekly average of itch (Mathias et al 2012). In 
relation to the mentioned MID results for the 150 mg dose of omalizumab with a difference between 
placebo and 150 mg dose of -2.95 and -3.04 is not considered clinically relevant since the values do 
not reach the minimal important differences (MIDs) of 4.5-5.0 even though statistically significance is 
reached. For the 75 mg dose the corresponding difference is -2.96 and -0.69. In general secondary 
endpoints support these conclusions.  
The proposed dose recommendation initially concerned two doses, i.e., 150 mg and 300 mg. The CHMP 
was of the opinion that convincing meaningful clinical data for the 150 mg dose including long term 
efficacy were not demonstrated and furthermore the circumstances when to use the 150 mg dose were 
unclear. The results further showed that for patients at above 80 kg the only relevant dose is 300 mg 
omalizumab. Since there are no apparent safety issues regarding the 300 mg dose, the use of the 150 
dose was questioned especially when considering the very unclear posology recommendation. In 
addition, the MAH was requested to identify which subgroups/patients were to be started with either 
the 150 mg dose or the 300 mg dose. 
In the absence of a predictive marker for 150 mg responders, and with no safety concerns at 
Xolair II-48 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/137079/2014  
Page 42/84 
 
 
300 mg, the MAH proposed a dose of omalizumab 300 mg every four weeks as this would ensure the 
maximum efficacy without additional safety risks, thereby providing the optimal benefit risk profile. 
The MAH was not able to identify any subgroup of patients or individuals that would benefit from the 
150 mg dose in comparison to the 300 mg dose and proposed during the assessment to only include 
the 300 mg dose. The use of the 300 mg dose by subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks is endorsed by 
the CHMP. 
Regarding angioedema, the difference is statistically significant and is considered clinically relevant 
only for the 300 mg dose. The CHMP agreed that patients with angioedema should be treated with 300 
mg omalizumab. 
The MAH presented data for all primary, secondary and main exploratory endpoints according to the 
presence of angioedema at baseline across the three pivotal studies. These data indicated that the 
presence of angioedema at baseline does not exert a significant impact of patient response to 
omalizumab. Omalizumab affords comparable therapeutic efficacy for all patients irrespective of their 
angioedema status at baseline, with a possible added benefit on quality of life for patients with 
angioedema at baseline. The CHMP concluded that the results show that  omalizumab affords 
comparable therapeutic efficacy for all patients irrespective of the angioedema status at baseline  
For adolescents no statistical significant effects were observed which was expected considering the few 
subjects included. However, the actual values were rather low and the results were not considered to 
be clinically meaningful. Furthermore, when considering that the estimated EC50 was 55% higher in 
adolescents as discussed in the clinical pharmacology section, it was not clear that an appropriate dose 
had been adequately explored for use in adolescents. Since the proposed new indication also involves 
adolescents 12-18 years, this raised a concern if the indication of CSU can be extended also to 
adolescents since there are no clinical data from the studies and it is possible that PKPD is different in 
this population. Therefore, the MAH was requested to provide a thorough analysis of efficacy (main and 
key secondary endpoints, responder analysis) and safety (adverse events) in this subpopulation. 
Furthermore, the MAH was requested to discuss to what extent extrapolation for the different entities 
covered under the CSU umbrella can be done from adults to adolescents, including dose-response 
similarity, to support an indication in this age subset.  
The MAH provided data showing that there were a total of 39 adolescents aged 12-17 (4% of all 
patients) within the three pivotal studies which is consistent with the estimated population prevalence. 
It is much less prevalent than in adults (0.1–0.3% in children in the United Kingdom, and up to 13% in 
Thailand). It is estimated that the paediatric population prevalence is around 5% of all CSU (Ghosh, 
1993), so the size of the adolescent sub-group in the studies was considered relevant by the CHMP. 
According to the MAH, and based on the full time course exposure-response analysis, adolescent 
patients are predicted to have higher EC50 values than adult patients. However, omalizumab trough 
levels are predicted to be higher in adolescents than in adults, due to the lower average body weight of 
adolescents. Indeed, in the 300 mg dose group, the median observed trough concentrations were 
about 50-70% higher for the adolescents, at week 12 and week 24. Thus, the effects on potency and 
systemic exposure compensate for each other. Simulated well-controlled responder rates indicate a 
significant treatment effect in adolescents for 300 mg q4w. The MAH stated that the results of all three 
studies provide evidence of a clear differentiation on weekly itch severity score (ISS) between the 300 
mg dose and placebo in adolescents. Further exploration of the reduction in weekly ISS comparing 
adults and adolescents at 300 mg showed a similar pattern of response. Clinical trial data on 
adolescents (12 to 17 years) included a total of 39 patients, of whom 11 received the 300 mg dose. 
Results for the 300 mg are available for 9 patients at week 12 and 6 patients at week 24, and show a 
similar magnitude of response to omalizumab treatment compared to the adult population. Mean 
change from baseline in weekly itch severity score showed a reduction of 8.25 at week 12 and of 8.95 
at week 24. The responder rates were: 33% at week 12 and 67% at week 24 for UAS7=0, and 56% at 
week 12 and 67% at week 24 for UAS7≤6. In summary although the group of adolescents is small and 
Xolair II-48 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/137079/2014  
Page 43/84 
 
 
not powered to see a statistically significant result over placebo, the data comparing the adolescents 
with adults do show that the responses are similar in both groups. 
The MAH concluded that, in the subpopulation of adolescents (aged between 12-17 years) with disease 
that has been unresponsive to other therapies and which is severe, as evidenced by the high baseline 
ISS and DLQI, omalizumab is able to control the symptoms of severe itch and wheals in the majority of 
adolescent patients at the 300 mg dose. This is superior to placebo and there are no specific safety 
concerns related to this age group. In addition, the MAH was not able to identify any subgroup of 
patients or individuals that would benefit from the 150 mg dose in comparison to the 300 mg dose. 
Thus, omalizumab 300 mg q4w appears to be efficacious and safe for adolescent patients. This was 
agreed by the CHMP. 
The MAH’s statement that since no differences are known between the pathophysiology of CSU in 
adolescents and adults it is reasonable to extrapolate from adult data to the adolescent group is 
accepted by the CHMP. The available data in adolescents who received 300 mg points to roughly 
similar effects as adults. The median trough concentrations are about 50-70% higher for adolescents 
when compared to adults further strengthen this.. The CHMP considered this sufficient to also include 
the adolescent group in the indication. The proposed wording in section 5.1 of the SmPC “Clinical trial 
data on adolescents (12 to 17 years) included a total of 39 patients, of whom 11 received the 300 mg 
dose. Results for the 300 mg are available for 9 patients at week 12 and 6 patients at week 24, and 
show a similar magnitude of response to omalizumab treatment compared to the adult population. 
Mean change from baseline in weekly itch severity score showed a reduction of 8.25 at week 12 and of 
8.95 at week 24. The responder rates were: 33% at week 12 and 67% at week 24 for UAS7=0, and 
56% at week 12 and 67% at week 24 for UAS7≤6.” is endorsed by the CHMP. 
Visual exploration of PK/PD did not reveal a significant effect of age >65 years compared with younger 
patients. The proportion of complete responders (UAS7=0) was similar between the elderly and the 
younger subgroups indicating a similar clinical response between the two groups. The CHMP concluded 
that the extended modeling does not reveal any overt effect of age on the PKPD-profile of omalizumab. 
The efficacy of omalizumab for the treatment of patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) has 
been evaluated in three pivotal studies. In two of the studies Q4881g and Q4882g the patients had 
active disease despite treatment with concomitant H1 antihistamine therapy at currently approved 
doses (Q4881g, Q4882g). In the third study Q4883g the patients had active disease despite receiving 
concomitant H1 antihistamine therapy (up to four times the approved dose), and H2 antihistamines 
and/or leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs). Convincing clinical effects are observed with the 300 
mg dose of omalizumab in all three studies. 
Current therapeutic recommendations for chronic urticaria are based on a step-up treatment algorithm, 
where patients are initially treated with approved doses of H1 antihistamines (the only currently 
approved therapy for chronic urticaria). If patients who do not respond to approved doses of 
antihistamines, the guidelines suggest to increase the dose up to fourfold if necessary. According to 
the Guideline on Summary of Product Characteristics, the indication should be stated clearly and 
concisely and should define the target disease or condition. Current guidelines suggest the addition of 
a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA), or less commonly a triple regimen of H1 and H2 
antihistamines combined with an LTRA (Zuberbier et al 2009b). This is the reason why patients 
included in study Q4883g should remain symptomatic despite H1 antihistamines at up to a four-fold 
dose, plus either or both of H2 antihistamines and LTRA. However, patients included in Q4881g and 
Q4882g studies had to be refractory to approved doses of H1 antihistamines for inclusion. Given that 
two-thirds of the efficacy outcome have been generated from the last two studies (which only had 
background therapy of an H1 antihistamines) and higher doses of anti-H1, antiH2 and LTRA are not 
approved in Europe for the chronic urticaria indication, the restriction of the indication to patients who

EMA/CHMP/137079/2014  
Page 44/84 
 
 
remain refractory to H1 antihistamine treatment, as proposed by the MAH, is considered adequate. 
According to the CHMP, adding the statement “in combination with H1 antihistamines” or “as add-on 
therapy” is not considered a duplication of the information around the requirement “inadequate 
response to H1 antihistamine treatment” since an inadequate response to H1 antihistamine treatment 
does not imply the type of therapy (substitution or add-on therapy) and its omission in the indication 
could lead to confusion. In conclusion, in order to address the CHMP’s requested a revision of the 
indication which takes into account the fact that Xolair should be given in combination with H1 
antihistamines in patients with inadequate response to antihistamine treatment, the MAH proposed the 
following indication statement: 
‘Xolair is indicated for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria in adult and adolescent (12 years 
and above) patients with inadequate response to H1 antihistamine treatment’. 
The  CHMP  suggested  the  addition  of  “moderate  to  severe  CSU”  in  the  indication  statement  to 
characterise the severity of the disease. However the MAH stated that in current clinical practice there 
are  no  guidelines  on  disease  severity  for  prescribers.  Furthermore  this  terminology  has  not  been 
adopted by the practicing physicians and there is no consensus on what would constitute moderate or 
severe  disease  in  CSU.  The  scores  that  have  been  used  in  the  omalizumab  development  programme 
such as UAS7 and ISS are not in general use in clinical practice, thus there is no available framework 
to  make  this  type  of  decision  on  disease  severity.  In  order  to  prevent  confusion  among  prescribers 
around  this  classification  in  the  label  it  is  deemed  prudent  to  avoid  this  wording  in  patients  who  will 
already  have  a  refractory  disease.  The  refractory  disease  status  is  appropriately  reflected  in  the 
indication wording by “patients with inadequate response to H1 antihistamine treatment”. 
As a consequence, the MAH included information regarding the use of omalizumab as add-on therapy 
(as stated for the allergic asthma indication) in the indication as follows: “Xolair is indicated as add-on 
therapy for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria in adult and adolescent (12 years and above) 
patients  with  inadequate  response  to  H1  antihistamine  treatment”.  This  proposal  is  accepted  by  the 
CHMP. 
Presence of auto-antibodies did not seem to affect significantly trough levels, and both populations 
(with and without auto-antibodies) did have a good respond to omalizumab. Therefore, the MAH’s 
conclusion that it does not seem warranted to recommend a different dosing for these subpopulations 
is endorsed. 
Regarding treatment duration, and according to clinical trial experience, the MAH stated that treatment 
duration should be up to 6 months and reassessment for further therapy should occur after this period. 
The MAH followed the CHMP request to include in section 4.2 of the SmPC that clinical trial experience 
of  long-term  treatment  beyond  6  months  in  this  indication  is  limited  as  follows:  “Prescribers  are 
advised  to  periodically  reassess  the  need  for  continued  therapy.  Clinical  trial  experience  of  long-term 
treatment beyond 6 months in this indication is limited”.  
Regarding  the  SmPC  statement  to  “periodically  reassess  the  need  for  continued  therapy”,  initially 
considered  insufficient  by  the  CHMP  due  to  irrelevant  differences  in  the  itchy  severity  score  (primary 
endpoint) between week 24 and week 12 in both 4881g and 4883g studies, and the CHMP suggestion 
for the treatment reassessment to take place after 3 months and to provide a more detailed guidance, 
the MAH explained that apart from the treatment durations in the phase III studies, no specific clinical 
data  is  available  from  the  omalizumab  CSU  clinical  program  to  support  a  specific  time  point  or  time 
period  for  re-assessment  whilst  the  patient  is  still  on  omalizumab  therapy.  Although  the  mean  itch 
severity  score  (ISS)  values  of  week  12  and  week  24  were  almost  identical,  examination  of 
the proportion of patients achieving a UAS7≤6 or a symptom free state (UAS=0) across both studies, 
Q4881g and Q4883g demonstrated a consistent trend for more patients (up to 12.3%) to achieve an 
improved  health  state  at  week  24  compared  to  week  12.   The  observed  increase  in  the  fraction  of 
Xolair II-48 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/137079/2014  
Page 45/84 
 
 
patients  reaching  a  symptom  free  or  a  robust  control  of  their  symptoms  with  longer  treatment  does 
argue for extending treatment to 24 weeks which is also not restricted by safety risks due to the good 
safety profile of omalizumab. The similar recurrence of itch symptoms towards baseline during the 16 
week drug washout period after week 12 (Q4882g) and week 24 (Q4881g and Q4883g) of treatment 
suggests  that  the  chances  of  symptoms  recurring  are  apparently  independent  of  the  duration  of 
therapy. Therefore, the CHMP agreed that the MAH statement insection 4.2 of the SmPC “periodically 
reassess the need for continued therapy” provides appropriate and sufficient guidance to the physician.  
Given the small number of re-treated patients (only 25), no conclusions can be drawn on re-treatment. 
Information regarding the limited experience of retreated patients will be included in the SPC (section 
5.1) as follows: “There is limited clinical experience in re-treatment of patients with omalizumab”. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The results of the primary efficacy endpoint, change from baseline in the weekly itch severity score, 
show that at Week 12, there was an observed difference between placebo and 300 mg omalizumab of  
-5.80, -4.81 and – 4.52 in studies Q4881g, Q4882g, and Q4883g, respectively. The difference is 
statistically significant and is considered clinically relevant.  
In the absence of a predictive marker for 150 mg responders, and with no safety concerns at 
300 mg, the dose of omalizumab 300 mg every four weeks proposed by the MAH is endorsed as this 
would ensure the maximum efficacy without additional safety risks, thereby providing the optimal 
benefit risk profile.  
Regarding angioedema, the difference is statistically significant and is considered clinically relevant 
only for the 300 mg dose. It is agreed that patients with angioedema should be treated with 300 mg 
omalizumab. Omalizumab affords comparable therapeutic efficacy for all patients irrespective of their 
angioedema status at baseline, with a possible added benefit on quality of life for patients with 
angioedema at baseline. 
Although the group of adolescents is small and not powered to see a statistically significant result over 
placebo, the data comparing the adolescents with adults do show that the responses are similar in both 
groups. Omalizumab 300 mg q4w appears to be efficacious in adolescent patients aged 12 - 17 years 
of age. 
The revised indication which takes into account the fact that Xolair should be given in combination with 
H1 antihistamines in patients with inadequate response to antihistamine treatment, as shown below, is 
considered acceptable by the CHMP: 
“Xolair is indicated as add-on therapy for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria in adult and 
adolescent (12 years and above) patients with inadequate response to H1 antihistamine treatment”.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The historical clinical development program for omalizumab is comprised of studies which evaluated 
the safety and efficacy of omalizumab in several indications, including the allergic asthma (AA), 
seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis (SAR, PAR) and atopic dermatitis indications. The product is 
approved for the indication of moderate to severe or severe AA only.  Omalizumab has been used 
worldwide since its initial approval in 2003. Its safety profile in patients with allergic asthma has been 
Xolair II-48 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/137079/2014  
Page 46/84 
 
 
 
well-characterized in clinical trials as well as in the post-marketing setting. As of 31 Dec 2012, the 
cumulative patient exposure since the first launch of omalizumab is estimated to be approximately 
410,890 patient-years.  
During these clinical trials in adult and adolescent patients 12 years of age and older, the most 
commonly reported adverse reactions were injection site reactions, including injection site pain, 
swelling, erythema and pruritus, and headaches.   
Type I local or systemic allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock, may occur 
when taking omalizumab, also with onset after a long duration of treatment. Most of these reactions 
occurred within 2 hours after the first and subsequent injections of Xolair. Anaphylactic reactions were 
rare in clinical trials. Serum sickness and serum sickness-like reactions, which are delayed allergic type 
III reactions, have also been reported in patients, frequency unknown.  
In rare cases, patients on therapy with anti-asthma medicinal products, including omalizumab, may 
present or develop systemic eosinophilia and vasculitis and in patients with severe asthma, systemic 
hypereosinophilic syndrome or allergic eosinophilic granulomatous vasculitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome) 
has been reported (frequency unknown). 
A numerical imbalance of Arterial thromboembolic events (ATE) was observed in controlled clinical 
trials and an ongoing observational study, ATE included stroke, transient ischaemic attack, myocardial 
infarction, unstable angina, and cardiovascular death (including death from unknown cause). The rate 
of ATE in patients in the controlled clinical trials was 6.29 for Xolair-treated patients (17/2703 patient 
years) and 3.42 for control patients (6/1755 patient years). In Cox proportional hazards model, Xolair 
was not associated with ATE risk (hazard ratio 1.86; 95% confidence interval 0.73-4.72). In the 
observational study, the rate of ATE was 5.59 (79/14140 patients years) for Xolair-treated patients 
and 3.71 (31/8366 patient years) for control patients. In a multivariate analysis controlling for baseline 
cardiovascular risk factors, Xolair was not associated with ATE risk (hazard ratio 1.11; 95% confidence 
interval 0.70-1.76). 
In clinical trials a few patients had platelet counts below the lower limit of the normal laboratory range. 
None of these changes were associated with bleeding episodes or a decrease in haemoglobin. No 
pattern of persistent decrease in platelet counts (observed in non-human primates), has been reported 
in humans (patients above 6 years of age), even though isolated cases of idiopathic thrombocytopenia 
have been reported in post-marketing setting. 
In patients at chronic high risk of helminthic infection, a placebo-controlled trial showed a slight 
numerical increase in infection rate with omalizumab that was not statistically significant. The course, 
severity, and response to treatment of infections were unaltered. 
A comprehensive analysis of the existing safety data up to 31-Dec- 2012 for omalizumab in the 
treatment of allergic asthma is provided in the latest PSUR [PSUR 16, 1 January 2012 – 31 December 
2012]. This update on omalizumab (‘Xolair’) in allergic asthma concluded the following: “No previously 
unidentified safety concerns were identified during the review period of current PSUR after thorough 
analysis of all available preclinical, clinical and post-marketing data of Xolair.” 
 Cumulative exposure data to omalizumab within clinical trials submitted in PSUR 16 is presented in 
table 15 below.

Table 15 – Cumulative exposure to omalizumab from completed clinical trials by age and sex 
Based on previous clinical trial data and of reports during  post-authorisation exposure, the RMP has 
included the following important Identified risks : 1/Anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions, 2/ Serum 
Sickness Syndrome (SSS) / Serum Sickness Like Disease (SSLD), 3/Antibody formation to 
omalizumab, 4/Churg Strauss Syndrome (CSS) / Hypereosinophilic Syndrome, 5/Thrombocytopenia.   
Important potential risks are 1/Arterial Thromboembolic Events (ATEs)2/Malignant neoplasms (children 
6 to less than 12 years old), 3/Malignant neoplasms in adults and adolescents ≥ 12 years of age, and 
4/Off label use. Important missing information is 1/Pregnancy outcomes.  
Data from pooled clinical studies and from a post-authorisation safety study (EXCELS) presented in the 
latest PSUR indicate according to the MAH no increased malignancy risk with Xolair. 
Submitted safety data of the applied new treatment indication 
The submitted clinical program for omalizumab included studies in the chronic spontaneous urticaria 
(CSU) indications which were conducted to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of omalizumab in 
the treatment of patients with CSU. Based on previous studies, including the 5 year epidemiology 
study EXCELS, ongoing pharmacovigilance and prescribing information of omalizumab for allergic 
asthma, the following AESIs were pre-specified for closer scrutiny in the CSU program: 
• Anaphylaxis 
• Thrombocytopenia and bleeding-related 
• Churg-Strauss syndrome 
• Hypersensitivity 
• Injection-site reaction 
• Malignancy 
• Serum sickness syndrome 
• Skin rash 
Patient exposure 
disorders 
• Hematopoietic cytopenias 
• Arterial thrombotic events 
• Asthma/bronchospasm 
• Liver-related investigations, signs and 
symptoms 
The evaluation of safety information for omalizumab for the treatment of patients with CSU who 
remain symptomatic despite concomitant therapy, is derived from three Phase III studies, including 
two pivotal efficacy studies (Q4881g, Q4882g) and one safety study (Q4883g). In addition there is 
supporting safety data from a phase II dose-ranging study (Q4577g (see table 16).

Table 16 – Summary of Key Studies Contributing to Safety Evaluation 
One further study not part of the MAH’s original development plan contributed further to supportive 
safety data in a total of 49 patients and is specified in table 17. 
Table 17 – Other completed trials (placebo-controlled) 
A total of 975 patients enrolled in the three Phase III studies received at least one dose of study drug 
and were included in the safety-evaluable population. Of these, a total of 733 patients received 
omalizumab, the numbers of patients and the different doses are specified in Table 1-5 below. With 
study Q4577g included, these four placebo-controlled studies comprised a total of 1065 patients, 802 
having received one or more doses of omalizumab. Safety data from study DE05 (table 17) was not 
included in the planned analysis for the SCS. However, data from that study is presented in a stand-
alone manner within the SCS. A total of 39 (4.0%) patients were 12 to 17 years old. The majority of 
the patients were white (85.4%) and female (73.4%).

Table 18 – Extent of Exposure to Study Drug for Studies Q4881g, Q4882g, and Q4883g 
Pooled (Core safety analysis set) 
The pooled Phase III safety population was organized into 4 analysis sets, according to the length of 
treatment period (12 or 24 weeks) and by the permitted background therapy. 
The ‘Core safety analysis set’ comprised the pooled safety population from all three Phase III placebo-
controlled studies. This analysis set is used to summarize pooled data from Day 1 to Week 12, and the 
16-week follow-up data, as both these study periods are common to all three Phase 3 studies. Because 
all patients are included in this population, it is also used for all background demographic, disease and 
other baseline safety presentations. 
The ‘Core safety analysis set by co-medications’ included all patients from the Core safety analysis set 
but presented the outputs by the permitted background CSU therapy, which was different for Study 
Q4883g compared to Studies Q4881g and Q4882g. Data were therefore presented side-by-side for 
Q4881g/Q4882g pooled versus Q4883g for the first 12 weeks of the treatment period and for the 16-
week follow-up period. 
The ‘Extended safety analysis set’ comprised the pooled safety population from the two placebo-
controlled studies of 24 weeks duration (Q4881g and Q4883g), and is used to summarise pooled data 
from Day 1 to Week 24, and the respective 16-week follow-up data. 
The ‘Extended safety analysis set by co-medications’ included all patients from the Extended safety 
analysis set, but presented the outputs by background CSU therapies, side-by side for the two studies 
for the 24 weeks treatment and 16-week follow-up periods. 
Phase II Study Q4577g is a stand-alone presentation of the safety data from this study.

baseline disease characteristics see table 1-7. At baseline, all but 5 patients were being treated with 
concomitant medications for CSU, and all but 8 patients were being treated with H1 antihistamines for 
CSU. Concomitant medication use at baseline was generally similar across all four treatment groups.

4 (1.0%) in the omalizumab 300 mg group.  
Adverse events 
The Core safety analysis set is the primary safety population used for safety presentations in the 
clinical overview, the studies having similar inclusion and exclusion criteria, treatment frequency, study 
assessments, and safety endpoints,. They differed only in terms of treatment duration (previous table 
18 and 22 below) and in allowed doses of co-medication with antihistamines for CSU.

The proportions of patients with at least one AE were similar in the omalizumab 150 mg and 300 mg 
groups (54.9% and 52 % respectively) but higher than those in the placebo and omalizumab 75 mg 
groups (42.6 % and 42.5 % respectively). The majority of AEs reported in all safety analysis sets were 
categorized by the investigators as mild or moderate in severity.

Overall, the three most frequent AEs were nasopharyngitis, headache, and sinusitis. Other frequently 
reported AEs in were upper respiratory tract infection, cough, and idiopathic urticaria. 
The MAH also provided the treatment-emergent AEs occurring during the treatment period (Day 1 to 
Week24) in the Week 24 pooled data (Studies Q4881g and Q4883g pooled) in the Extended safety 
analysis set (all patients=653). 
The percentage of patients reporting events in the Day 1 to Week 24 was higher, as would be expected 
from a doubling of exposure duration; however, no marked difference was apparent in the pattern of 
reporting (distribution across treatment groups) or type of event reported. The profile of most common 
AEs was broadly similar to that in the 12-week pooled data, with nasopharyngitis being the most 
common AE in each treatment group other than the 75 mg omalizumab group (where the most 
common AEs, all occurring in 7.1% of patients, were sinusitis, urticaria and idiopathic urticaria). The 
SOCs in which AEs were most frequently reported were Infections and infestations (31.9% of patients 
across all treatment groups), Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (15.2%), Nervous system 
disorders (12.6%), Gastrointestinal disorders (11.5%) and Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal 
disorders (11.5%). Nasopharyngitis was the only AE to occur in more than 10% of patients in any 
treatment group: 10.4% in the placebo group, 4.3% in the 75 mg omalizumab group, 12.6% in the 
omalizumab 150 mg group and 9.3% in the 300 mg group. Other frequent AEs included sinusitis, 
headache, and upper respiratory tract infection.  
None of the most common AEs showed a clear dose relationship, although headache was more 
common in the two highest dose groups (150 mg: 9.2%, 300 mg: 8.1%, 75 mg 5.7% and placebo 
3.1%) as was arthralgia (150 mg: 5.7%, 300 mg: 3.0%, 75 mg 1.4% and placebo 1.2%). 
Several AEs were more frequent in the 150 mg omalizumab group than the other groups, as reflected 
in the higher total incidence of AEs in this group. These were, in addition to arthralgia and headache as 
noted above, oropharyngeal pain (5.7%, with rates of 1.8% to 4.3% in other groups), urinary tract 
infection (4.6%, other groups 1.4% to 2.4%), pain in extremity (3.4%, other groups zero to 1.4%),

fungal infection (3.4%, other groups zero to 0.6%), pyrexia (3.4%, other groups 0.9% to 1.4%), and 
migraine (3.4%, other groups zero to 1.8%) 
Overall, the three most frequent AEs in the Core safety and Extended safety analysis sets were 
nasopharyngitis, headache, and sinusitis. Other frequently reported AEs in both analysis sets were 
upper respiratory tract infection, cough, and idiopathic urticaria. Most of these events were reported at 
similar rates across treatment groups, with the exception of headache, which was reported more 
frequently relative to placebo in the omalizumab 150 mg and 300 mg dose groups. Nasopharyngitis, 
sinusitis, upper respiratory tract infection, arthralgia, and pain in extremity were seen slightly more 
frequently in one or more omalizumab groups relative to placebo, while idiopathic urticaria was 
reported at slightly higher rate in the lower dose (75 mg dose omalizumab group), and urticaria was 
seen least frequently in the 300 mg group over the longer 24-week treatment period. 
AEs reported during follow-up 
The Phase III studies incorporated a 16-week follow-up period into their design. This period was 
assessed separately (Core safety analysis set and Core safety analysis set by co-medications) for the 
incidence of all AEs, for AEs by severity, and for SAEs.  
The overall incidence of AEs during follow-up was similar between placebo (43.0%) and omalizumab 
75 mg (42.5%), and higher in the 150 mg and 300 mg omalizumab groups (49.7% and 50.0% 
respectively. In the omalizumab groups, the AE profile was broadly similar to that seen in placebo. 
Most SOCs showed a similar percentage of patients reporting events; however, one or more of the 
omalizumab groups did show an imbalance compared to placebo for two SOCs. Imbalances were seen 
in Infections and infestations: placebo (19.4%) vs. omalizumab 150 mg (26.3%) and 300 mg 
(22.1%); Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: placebo (9.1%) vs. omalizumab 75 mg (15.8%), 
150 mg (12.6%) and 300 mg (17.7%). The difference in skin and subcutaneous events seem likely to 
be due to the re-emergence of symptoms that were controlled under active treatment.  
To further assess the possibility of rebound in the pooled Phase III studies, adverse events which 
occurred during the follow-up period of the studies were evaluated to identify CSU related SAEs or 
severe AEs that occurred after discontinuation of study medication. In addition, changes from baseline 
in itch severity score, UAS7 and weekly number of hives score were also evaluated during the follow-
up period to identify patients who reported weekly scores which were ≥125% or ≥150% of their 
baseline score at any time after their last dose of study medication. These analyses were all performed 
on the Core safety analysis set. 
Overall, and in combination with summary statistics of efficacy parameters over time during the follow-
up period, the results of these analyses did not suggest significant rebound effects after the 
discontinuation of treatment. In general, the treatment differences between omalizumab and placebo 
for potential rebound events were relatively small and did not increase with increasing dose. 
The events noted above as being higher or slightly higher with omalizumab than with placebo were 
among a number of events identified in a pooled analysis to identify candidates as potential adverse 
reactions (ARs) in the CSU program. Events suspected to be drug-related for which there is some 
medical basis to suspect a causal relationship between the drug and the event occurring during the 
treatment were identified primarily on the basis of the safety experience in the 975 patients with CSU 
in the three Phase III studies. The pooled Phase III safety population was organized into two analysis 
sets, according to the length of treatment period (Day 1 to Week 12 and Day 1 to Week 24). AE data 
pertaining to these two doses of 150 mg and 300 mg respectively were taken into consideration for the 
purpose of identifying ARs.  
The selection of potential AR candidates from all reported AEs in the above mentioned studies was 
based on the following approach: 
Xolair II-48 
Assessment report

Page 60/84 
 
 
• All AEs occurring during the treatment period with an incidence of ≥1% in any treatment group in 
studies Q4881g, Q4882g and Q4883g were reviewed. 
• Among the AEs identified above, those occurring at a ≥ 2% higher rate in either of the 150 mg or 
300 mg omalizumab groups than in the placebo group were generally considered ARs, unless the 
medical analysis provided sufficient evidence for confounding, thereby not justifying a classification as 
ARs. 
Events identified as AR candidates are shown for the Day 1 to Week 12 treatment period in Tables 25 
and 26.

Table 27 – Adverse reactions in pooled CSU safety database 
Following a medical evaluation by the MAH toothache, fungal infection, and anxiety were excluded from 
being identified as ARs. The remaining reaction candidates were considered ARs.   
Based on the above discussion, Table 2-5 was prepared, which represents the confirmed ADRs to be 
included in the CDS. Adverse reactions are ranked according to their frequency, the most frequent 
first, using the following convention: Very common (≥10%); common (≥1/100, <1/10); uncommon 
(≥1/1000, <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000, <1/1000); very rare (<1/10,000), including isolated reports. 
Additional events reported anytime during the 1-24 week treatment period (studies Q4881g and 
Q4883g) that met the definition of adverse reactions (events occurring in ≥1% of patients in any 
treatment group and ≥ 2% more frequently in any omalizumab treatment group than in the placebo 
group) are listed below: 
• Infections and infestations: upper respiratory tract infections (placebo 3.1%, 150 mg  3.4%, 300 mg 
5.7%), urinary tract infection (placebo 1.8%, 150 mg 4.6%, 300 mg 2.4%) 
• Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: myalgia (placebo 0%, 150 mg 2.3%, 300 mg 
0.9%), pain in extremity (placebo 0%, 150 mg 3.4%, 300 mg 0.9%), musculoskeletal pain (placebo 
0%, 150 mg 2.3%, 300 mg 0.9%) 
• General disorders and administration site conditions: pyrexia (placebo 1.2%, 150 mg 3.4%, 300 mg 
0.9%) 
• Nervous system disorders: sinus headache (placebo 0%, 150 mg 2.3%, 300 mg 0.3%) 
Injection site reactions identified from search results were reported in the omalizumab 300 mg group, 
where 11 (2.7%) patients reported an event; this compares to 1 (0.6%) patient in the 150mg group 
and 2 (0.8%) patients with placebo. The event did not meet the criterion of being ≥ 2% higher than 
placebo, but all cases were suspected to be related to study drug by the investigators. Therefore it was 
felt to be a notable reaction in the label. 
Core safety analysis set by co-medications 
To assess any impact of concomitant medications on the AE profile of omalizumab in CSU patients, AEs 
were summarized separately for Studies Q4881g and Q4882g pooled and Study Q4883g (Day 1 to 
Week 12), as the latter study included patients with a wider range of other medications used to treat 
CSU. When comparing these two outcomes, the proportion of patients experiencing at least one AE 
was higher for the omalizumab 300 mg group in Study Q4883g (56.7%) than for the corresponding 
group in the pooled Q4881g and Q4882g data (41.9%); the corresponding placebo groups showed 
similar proportions of patients with AEs (43.4% and 42.1%, respectively). The SOCs in which AEs were 
most commonly reported were similar. However, in most of these SOCs, the placebo group and the 
300 mg group in Q4883g tended to have higher rates of AEs than the corresponding groups in the 
pooled Q4881g and Q4882g data. There were some differences between the two outcomes groups 
Xolair II-48 
Assessment report

considering the most frequent AE preferred terms that may be related to differences in concomitant 
medications at baseline. Such were i.e. diarrhea and nausea. Headache also showed a greater 
difference between 300 mg omalizumab and placebo in the Q4883g data. Among less frequent AEs, 
asthma showed a greater difference from placebo in Q4883g as did eczema. 
Similar findings were detected of treatment-emergent AEs occurring during the extended treatment 
period (Day 1 to Week24) for Studies Q4881g and Q4883g separately. In Study Q4881g the rate of GI 
AEs was much lower (in the 300 mg groups 15.9% and 6.2% for studies Q4883g and Q4881g 
respectively). The rates of GI disorders in the placebo groups in both studies were similar to those for 
the 300 mg groups, and the difference between studies may reflect the difference between studies in 
background medications that may affect the GI system at a low level. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No deaths were reported in the studies contributing to the safety evaluation of the applied new 
treatment indication.  
Table 28 – Patients with deaths, other serious and other clinically significant AEs over whole 
study treatment period (Core safety analysis set) 
Patients experiencing treatment-emergent SAEs within the Core safety data set (Day1-Week 12) are 
summarized in Table 29 below. 
There were few SAEs during the treatment period: a total of 15 patients (1.5%) had at least one SAE. 
SAEs in total were more common in the placebo group than in any of the omalizumab treatment 
groups.

Table 29 – Patients with Treatment-Emergent SAEs Occurring During the treatment period 
Day 1 to Week 12 (Core safety analysis set) 
No SAE preferred term, other than angioedema, was reported in more than one patient. The SAEs 
were distributed across various SOCs and did not occur predominantly in one SOC. There was no 
particular pattern of occurrence of SAEs within or across the treatment groups. None of the SAEs was 
considered by the investigators to be related to study medication. 
The SOC for which SAEs were reported most commonly was Infections and infestations, in which SAEs 
were reported for 3 patients: 
• 1 patient in the placebo group [Study Q4882g] had an SAE of severe pneumonia, which required hospitalization but 
resolved in 4 days following treatment. The SAE was not suspected to be related to study medication, and the patient 
continued in the study 
• 1 patient in the omalizumab 300 mg group [Study Q4883g-] had an SAE of severe retroperitoneal 
infection, reported as retroperitoneal granulomatous disease due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The 
patient had a remote history of tuberculosis. This SAE was treated with a combination of antibiotics, 
but led to discontinuation of the patient from the study, having received only 1 dose of study drug. The 
patient did not complete follow-up and the event was ongoing at the last visit. The SAE was not 
suspected to be related to study medication. 
• 1 patient in the omalizumab 300 mg group [Study Q4883g-] had an SAE of pelvic abscess, which 
occurred 3 days after the last dose of study drug, following an elective hysterectomy. Following 
treatment, the event resolved within 10 days. The SAE was not suspected to be related to study 
medication. 
Xolair II-48 
Assessment report

Page 64/84 
 
 
 
Two patients had SAEs of angioedema in the omalizumab 75mg group and omalizumab 300 mg group 
respectively. The first patient (75 mg) had a medical history of severe angioedema prior to enrolment. 
The second patient (300 mg) developed severe angioedema of 2 days duration 30 days after last study 
drug administration. Both cases were considered to be life-threatening, resolved following treatment 
and both patients continued the study drug 
It should be noted that there were 2 further patients ([Study Q4883g] in the placebo group and [Study 
Q4881g] in the omalizumab 150 mg group) who had SAEs of angioedema during the treatment period, 
but both of these patients took excluded medications between Day 1 and Week 12 and so AEs 
occurring on or after the start date of the excluded medication were summarised for the follow-up 
period.  
The SAEs in this analysis set may therefore represent a range of intercurrent illnesses and elective 
surgery, and do not appear to be related to study treatment or (with the exception of the two 
angioedema SAEs) the indication studied. 
Extended safety analysis set of SAEs (Day 1 to Week 24) 
In the extended analysis (Day1-24Weeks) the proportion of patients experiencing at least one SAE was 
low, 19 patients (2.9%) and the proportion of patients experiencing an SAE was greater in the placebo 
group (7 patients, 4.3%) compared with the omalizumab 75 mg (2 patients, 2.9%), 150 mg, (3 
patients, 3.4%) and 300 mg groups (7 patients, 2.1%). The SAEs reported were:  
Placebo group: angina unstable, hypersensitivity*, radius fracture*, type 2 diabetes mellitus*, 
hyperglycaemia*, cervical dysplasia (subsequently discovered to be cervical adenocarcinoma)*, and 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease* 
Omalizumab 75 mg group: gastroesophageal reflux disease and urticaria 
Omalizumab 150 mg group: angina unstable, appendicitis, pain in extremity, and hypertension* 
Omalizumab 300 mg: cholelithiasis, gastroenteritis, retroperitoneal infection*, pelvic abscess*, lower 
respiratory tract infection, gastroenteritis viral, angioedema*, and intermittent claudication.  
(Those events marked with an asterisk (*) were also present in the core safety analysis set (pooled 
Day 1 to Week 12 data)) 
None of these SAEs was suspected to be related to study medication by the investigators. 
Safety analyses of SAEs by co-medications 
Considering the placebo and 300 mg omalizumab treatment groups (Study Q4883g did not have 75 
mg or 150 mg omalizumab treatment groups), SAEs occurred at very similar rates in the Core safety 
analysis set (Day 1 to Week 12) by co-medications  when comparing the 300 mg groups in Study 
Q4883g (1.2%) and the Q4881g/Q4882g pooled data (1.3%).   
In the Extended analyses (Day 1-Week 24) of reported SAEs of both studies (Q4881g vs. Q4883g) the 
placebo groups had higher rates of SAEs than the omalizumab 300 mg groups (Q4881g, placebo: 
5.0%, omalizumab 300 mg: zero; Q4883g, placebo 3.6%, omalizumab 300 mg 2.8%). 
Apart from SAES in the Infections and Infestations SOC being more common in the 300 mg group in 
Q4883g there were no other obvious patterns of difference between the two studies in SAE profile. 
Concentration-safety relationship 
Xolair II-48 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/137079/2014  
Page 65/84 
 
 
 
Relationships between safety and omalizumab concentrations were examined graphically based on 
pooled data from the three Phase III studies Q4881g, Q4882g, and Q4883g. The safety endpoints 
evaluated included any treatment-emergent adverse event, serious adverse event or severe adverse 
event during the treatment period. The concentration measure used in this analysis was the observed 
omalizumab trough at Week 12 as the common PK measurement during the treatment phase across all 
Phase III studies. 
There was no evidence for an increased rate of treatment-emergent adverse events, serious or severe 
adverse events during the treatment period in patients with higher concentrations of omalizumab over 
the dose range tested (75 to 300 mg every 4 weeks). However, it is stated in the updated RMP, 
version 9 with track changes, page 63, that a summary of AEs suspected by the investigators to be 
related to study drug for the core safety analysis set was assessed across all treatment groups. In this 
8.0% of patients had at least one AE suspected to be treatment-related and that there was a possible 
dose relationship for the total incidence of suspected treatment-related AEs, with 5.8%, 7.5%, 8.6%, 
and 9.2% of patients in the placebo, omalizumab 75 mg, 150 mg, and 300 mg groups, respectively, 
having at least one such AE.  
In addition no effect of body weight or baseline IgE concentration was observed on any treatment 
emergent, serious, or severe adverse event  rates during the treatment period adverse event, although 
few serious or severe adverse events were observed. 
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) 
A number of adverse events groupings were pre-specified for the safety analysis as being of special 
interest for omalizumab treatment based on previous clinical experience. Of these AESI, only 
hypersensitivity and injection site reactions demonstrated an imbalance (higher incidence in 
omalizumab) that could be clinically significant. Most of these events were of mild to moderate 
severity, not serious, and did not generally lead to discontinuation from the study.  
As one of the most clinically important AESI, potential anaphylaxis events were screened and 
evaluated. In Phase III CSU program, no cases of anaphylaxis attributed to omalizumab were reported 
during the treatment period. Some of the adverse events, such as urticaria and angioedema, could be 
symptoms of the background CSU. However as some of these disease features can also be components 
of potential anaphylaxis therefore any potential anaphylaxis events identified in Studies Q4881g, 
Q4882g and Q4883g were reviewed by a blinded, independent Anaphylaxis Review Committee (ARC), 
which conducted an expert review of the suspected anaphylaxis events. In summary, the Anaphylaxis 
Review Committee determined no evidence to indicate anaphylaxis in CSU patients being treated with 
omalizumab 
Laboratory findings 
Biochemistry parameters were analysed in all the individual studies. No consistent or clinically relevant 
changes from baseline in any biochemistry parameter were seen compared to placebo, nor were any 
noteworthy differences seen in the rate of biochemistry abnormalities reported in individual patients 
within the Phase II and Phase III studies.  
Both thrombocytopenia and hematopoietic cytopenias were pre-specified as AEs of special interest but 
were rarely reported and showed no imbalance as laboratory abnormalities in the omalizumab 
treatment groups. In total seven patients reported such an event with no imbalance between 
treatment groups: placebo 2/242 (0.8%) patients, omalizumab 75 mg 1/146 (0.7%) patients, 
omalizumab 150 mg 1/175 (0.6%) patients, omalizumab 300 mg 3/412 (0.7%) patients. Most low 
counts were transient, but for [Study Q4883g-patient-34601] in the 300 mg omalizumab group, the 
count was low (although >LLN) at baseline, lowered from baseline to Week 4, and then worsened 
during Follow-up. An AE of ‘worsening thrombocytopenia’ was reported for this patient approximately 3 
Xolair II-48 
Assessment report

Page 66/84 
 
 
months after the week 4 visit that was considered of severe intensity and related to study drug. This 
AE required medical intervention, but was not considered an SAE, and was ongoing at the end of the 
study.  
All patients were tested for anti-therapeutic antibodies at Day 1 (pre-dose) and at Week 40 (end of 
follow-up period) or early termination. Only one patient in the omalizumab 300 mg group had a 
positive result; this was recorded pre-dose, but the patient had a negative result for ATA after 
treatment with omalizumab so this finding was not considered relevant. 
Safety in special populations 
There were no trials performed in special populations. The pooled data from clinical studies in CSU 
indicate no new additional safety concerns, and no change in pattern and frequency of the known 
safety signals. The safety profile in patients with refractory CSU was similar to the previously observed 
profile in allergic asthma. The studied population matched the intended target population, and included 
representation from patients in all subgroups likely to be included within that target population, 
including adolescents and the elderly. Subgroup analysis was performed on the incidence of SAEs 
during the treatment period for all four safety analysis sets. In addition, subgroup analysis was 
performed on the incidence of AESIs during the treatment period for the Core safety analysis set and 
Core safety analysis set by co-medications.  
A total of 39 (4.0%) children between 12 to 17 years old were included in the studies. Of these 29 
were exposed to omalizumab. AEs were evaluated in demographic subgroups (age, sex, race), by 
baseline weekly itch severity score, by presence or not of angioedema at baseline, by body weight 
category, by geographical region of recruitment (US or non-US); also by background and previous CSU 
medications taken. None of these subgroup analyses appeared to reveal a sub-population who were 
particularly at risk of adverse outcomes, or revealed a relevant difference in SAE profile compared to 
that seen in the overall CSU population. The background medication received by the patients also 
made no detectable difference to the safety profile. However, it should be noted that there was a very 
small numbers of patients in some subgroups, and a small number of SAEs reported overall, meaning 
that the subgroup data presented needs to be interpreted with caution.  
• 
Pregnancy, birth and lactation 
A total of eight pregnancies are known to have occurred during the CSU clinical trials. At the time of 
document preparation, four pregnancies were ongoing, three had proceeded to successful delivery, and 
one therapeutic medical abortion had been performed. A pregnancy registry (EXPECT, in the US) is in 
operation for the allergic asthma indication. There have been no adequate and well-controlled studies 
of omalizumab in pregnant women, and omalizumab should only be used during pregnancy if the 
benefits clearly outweigh the risks. Women of childbearing age constitute a significant proportion of the 
typical CSU patient population, and in the completed CSU clinical studies, 8 pregnancies occurred. 
Based on experience in the allergic asthma indication, omalizumab treatment does not appear to have 
untoward effects on pregnancy outcome. However, it is expected that omalizumab will be excreted in 
milk, and caution should therefore be exercised when administering omalizumab to a nursing woman. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
There is no new information available related to drug interaction specific to omalizumab. 
Based on the mechanism of action of omalizumab, there are no anticipated interactions with the 
background medication used as the current standard of care in CSU. 
Within the CSU development program, in the two efficacy studies (Q4881g and Q4882g) where H1 
antihistamines were used, there was no evidence that the safety of omalizumab was altered relative to 
the known safety profile of omalizumab in allergic asthma. In the safety study Q4883g with 
Xolair II-48 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/137079/2014  
Page 67/84 
 
 
concomitant use of one or more of H1 antihistamines, and either one or both of H2 blockers or LTRAs, 
the safety profile for omalizumab also appeared to be unaltered. 
In addition, a population pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic analysis of the data from studies 
Q4577g, Q4881g, Q4882g and Q4883g showed no relevant effect of H2 antihistamines and LTRAs on 
omalizumab pharmacokinetics. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No studies were prematurely discontinued. 
Post-marketing experience 
Omalizumab has been used worldwide since its initial approval for the indication of allergic asthma in 
2003. Its safety profile in patients with allergic asthma has been well-characterized in clinical trials as 
well as in the post-marketing setting. As of 31 Dec 2012, the cumulative patient exposure since the 
first launch of omalizumab is estimated to be approximately 410,890 patient-years. For further 
information and discussion see the Introduction section. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of omalizumab has been characterised in clinical trials of patients with AA and over a 
10-year post-authorisation period. As of 31 Dec 2012, the cumulative patient exposure since the first 
launch of omalizumab is estimated to be approximately 410,890 patient-years. During these clinical 
trials, the most commonly reported adverse reactions were injection site reactions, including injection 
site pain, swelling, erythema and pruritus, and headaches in adult and adolescent patients 12 years of 
age and older.   
In the pivotal studies of patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), 975 patients between the 
ages of 12 -75 were treated 12-24 weeks. The number of included children between 12-17 years of 
age was 39 (4 % of the study population) whereof 29 received omalizumab. There were no children 
below the age of 12 included. Of the 412 patients who were exposed to the recommended dose of 300 
mg omalizumab every 4th week, 282 were exposed for 21-24 weeks. In the pooled core safety analysis 
of the three pivotal studies in total 404 patients were exposed to  any dose of omalizumab for 21-24 
weeks and only 23 patients extended their exposure to omalizumab >24 weeks.  
The information presented in the submitted summary table of system organ class classified events for 
the Extended analyses support the finding of a similar safety profile compared with the data 
characterized in the Core safety analyses data set (12 weeks of treatment). In general the absolute 
percentage of patients with reported AEs increased by a bit more than 10 % within all treatment 
groups including placebo (i.e. approx. 15 % within the placebo group, 14 % within the group treated 
with 150 mg omalizumab and 12 % within the group treated with 300 mg omalizumab). However, as 
noted, the increase is balanced between treatment groups including placebo. There are no outstanding 
AEs during the extended period of Day 1 to Week 24 that differ from the period of Day 1 to Week 12.     
Long-term clinical trial data of CSU patients beyond 24 weeks study treatment plus 16 weeks follow-up 
is sparse. Of the 412 patients who were exposed to the recommended dose of 300 mg omalizumab 
every 4th week, 282 were exposed for 21-24 weeks. In the pooled core safety analysis of the three 
pivotal studies in total 404 patients were exposed to  any dose of omalizumab for 21-24 weeks and 
only 23 patients extended their exposure to omalizumab >24 weeks.  However, this deficiency in long-
term follow-up is balanced by the fact that the product has been in use since 10 years and its safety 
profile well-characterized in patients with allergic asthma both in clinical trials and post-marketing 
setting.  As the reported  adverse events during CSU trials show consistency with the known safety 
profile of omalizumab in the treatment of allergic asthma (AA) and  no new safety signals have been 
Xolair II-48 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/137079/2014  
Page 68/84 
 
 
detected, the data from the AA trials are supportive to the CSU data of an acceptable long-term safety 
profile. 
The safety profile presented in this variation application was consistent with the known safety profile of 
omalizumab in the treatment of allergic asthma (AA). There were no evident signals of increased 
incidence of adverse events in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), nor was there any 
evidence of an increased rate of treatment-emergent adverse events, serious or severe adverse events 
during the treatment period in patients with higher concentrations of omalizumab over the dose range 
tested (75 to 300 mg every 4 weeks).  
In order to rule out the possibility of a dose relationship of selected AEs suspected to be related to the 
study drug, a more detailed analysis of individual AEs was provided by the MAH. This analysis did not 
show a clear dose relationship or clusters of AEs for any SOC with the exception of Nervous system 
disorders SOC and General disorders and administration site conditions SOC, both of which were 
mainly driven by events which are listed in the proposed product information (i.e. headache and 
injection site reactions).  
Overall, the three most frequent AEs were nasopharyngitis, headache, and sinusitis. Other frequently 
reported AEs in both analysis sets were upper respiratory tract infection, cough, and idiopathic urticaria 
and arthralgia. The majority of AEs reported in all safety analysis sets were categorised by the 
investigators as mild or moderate in severity. Among the more frequently reported AEs, headache was 
more common relative to placebo in the omalizumab 150 mg and 300 mg dose groups.  
Nasopharyngitis, sinusitis, upper respiratory tract infection, arthralgia, and pain in extremity were seen 
at slightly higher rates in one or more omalizumab groups relative to placebo, and idiopathic urticaria 
was reported at a slightly higher rate in the 75 mg dose. Urticaria was seen least frequently in the 300 
mg group over the longer 24-week treatment period, consistent with superior efficacy at the higher 
dose. 
The MAH provided a thorough discussion which included CSU symptom profile classification of subjects 
who experienced CSU-related AEs during the follow up period. The presented results based on the 
post-treatment CSU profiles measured as itch severity score and weekly number of hives score show 
the proportion of patients with CSU related AEs are 18/242 (7.4%), 18/146 (12.3%), 21/175 (12.0%), 
and 66/412 (16.0%) in the placebo group, 75 mg group, 150 mg group and 300 mg group, 
respectively. The CHMP agreed that patients treated with omalizumab in particular the 300 mg dose, in 
contrast to placebo, have the highest rates of CSU related AEs during the follow-up period. In 
summary there was neither a clear imbalance nor a dose dependent increase in the incidence of 
patients reporting a worsening of ≥ 150% over baseline of the weekly CSU signs and symptom scores 
(itch, hives, UAS7). Furthermore, the analysis of AEs with regards to the CSU symptom profiles 
strongly suggests that the imbalance in CSU-related AEs is most probably due to the observed robust 
therapeutic benefit experienced by patients in response to omalizumab treatment followed by loss of 
that protection after cessation of treatment. This is particularly evident in the 300 mg group where 
withdrawal of the therapeutic afforded by omalizumab, leads to the greatest CSU-related AEs reported 
by patients. In view of this, the addition of a statement in the label pertaining to the development of 
flares or to worsening of symptoms to an extent greater than those present before the commencement 
of omalizumab therapy is not deemed justified. 
Although the mechanism of omalizumab is not entirely understood, it is known that omalizumab binds 
to IgE and lowers free IgE levels. Subsequently, IgE receptors (FcεRI) on cells down-regulate. In 
clinical studies in CSU patients, maximum suppression of free IgE was observed 3 days after the first 
subcutaneous dose. After repeated dosing once every 4 weeks, pre-dose serum free IgE levels 
Xolair II-48 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/137079/2014  
Page 69/84 
 
 
 
remained stable between 12 and 24 weeks of treatment. After discontinuation of Xolair, free IgE levels 
increased towards pre-treatment levels over a 16-week treatment-free follow-up period. Taking into 
account that the mechanism is mediated through a binding to IgE and thus lowering of  free IgE levels, 
and that there is extensive experience for patients with allergic asthma where no observed rebound in 
IgE levels is observed after washout, the CHMP considered that this will also be applicable for the 
patients with CSU. The data presented by the MAH do not point to that patients’ experience ‘flare’ after 
study drug termination. 
It  is known from studies related to asthma treatment that discontinuation of Xolair treatment 
generally results in a return to elevated free IgE levels and associated symptoms. The information on 
allergic asthma in section 5.1 of the SmC describes the following: ‘In clinical studies in allergic asthma 
patients, serum free IgE levels were reduced in a dose-dependent manner within one hour following 
the first dose and maintained between doses. One year after discontinuation of Xolair dosing, the IgE 
levels had returned to pre-treatment levels with no observed rebound in IgE levels after washout of the 
medicinal product.’  
No deaths were reported and there were fairly few SAEs within the CSU trials. No new signals have 
appeared within the trials of CSU.  
There appeared to be no difference in the proportions of patients reporting at least one AE between the 
omalizumab 150 mg and 300 mg groups (54.9% and 52 % respectively).   
AEs of special interest have so far included anaphylactic reactions, thrombocytopaenia, CSS and serum 
sickness syndrome. In the most recent PSUR assessment report it was stated that there was no 
evidence of a change in pattern, frequency or severity of these events when used in the approved AA 
indication. 
Baseline angioedema rates seem to be balanced and the analyse of Day 1 to Week 12 data of 
incidences of the AE “angioedema” showed higher figures in placebo treated patients. Among the 
patients who continued on study treatment following the experience of angioedema, there were no 
positive rechallenges according to the presented data. The proposal by the MAH not to add 
angioedema as an AE in CSU in the product information is accepted by the CHMP.  
Most cases of hypersensitivity were unrelated to study treatment. The hypersensitivity reactions are 
addressed in the RMP and will be closely monitored. 
Co-medication with standard therapy of urticaria does not seem to have a major impact on the safety 
profile of omalizumab. Although the proportion of patients with experience of AEs was higher in the 
group with a wider range of co-medications used to treat the CSU, the general safety profile appeared 
similar.  
The review of adverse events of urticaria reported during the treatment period did not show a visible 
trend for lack of efficacy. This is supported by the following points: 
• A markedly higher incidence of urticaria was observed in the placebo and 75 mg treatment arms in 
both, the 12 Week and the 24 Week periods 
• A positive dose-response was observed, showing lower incidences of urticaria with higher doses in 
both, the 12 Week and the 24 Week periods 
• A majority of the mild cases were observed in the highest dose groups combined compared to 
placebo and 75 mg. 
Clinically relevant effects are achieved with the 300 mg dose.  For the 300 mg dose there is no 
tendency of higher incidences of urticaria. The higher incidences of urticaria are only observed in the 
placebo and 75 mg treatment arms. Thus, there is no lack of efficacy for the 300 mg dose.

It seems unlikely that the imbalances in the incidence of infections ((upper respiratory tract infection, 
urinary tract infection and lower respiratory tract infection) seen in the omalizumab groups compared 
to placebo were linked to the omalizumab treatment. Neither of the infection reports was considered 
related to study medication by the investigator. Furthermore, the time-to-onset (post-last dose) 
analysis performed showed that most of the cases were clustering in the interval between 49-120 days 
after the last dose. The MAH stated that omalizumab concentrations are predicted to decrease to levels 
corresponding to EC10 within 38 and 62 days after the last dose in the 150 mg and 300 mg dose 
groups, respectively. This is endorsed by the CHMP. 
The CHMP is of the view that there is no evidence of a different adverse event profile in adolescents; 
specifically there were no deaths, no SAE related to omalizumab and no omalizumab related AE of 
special interest reported in these patients. The safety of omalizumab in a population aged 6 to <18 
years has also been fully explored within large clinical trials in a paediatric population with severe 
allergic asthma. 
The number of included children between 12-17 years of age is low making the evaluation of the safety 
profile of CSU patients within this cohort difficult to evaluate. However, a considerable amount of 
individuals within this age range has been included in the AA trials (with a maximum recommended 
dose is 600 mg omalizumab every 2 weeks) and data from these trials support an acceptable safety 
profile in this age group. The CHMP concluded that from a safety point of view there are no concerns in 
the adolescent group.  
A reduced number of elderly patients have been included in the efficacy and safety studies: only 51 
patients aged 65-74 and 3 patients aged 75-84 were included. No patients >85 years were included. 
There appears to be some imbalances between these age groups in the AES suspected by the 
investigator. There is a higher incidence of nervous system disorders in the 65-74 age subgroup 
(3.9%) compared to the age <65 subgroup (2.7%) and there is a higher incidence in the sum of 
postural, hypotension, falls, black outs, syncope, dizziness, ataxia and fractures (2.0% in 65-74 age 
subgroup compared to 0.5% in the age <65 subgroup). However, given the small number of patients 
included, conclusions cannot be drawn. The CHMP concluded that the safety profile associated with the 
elderly subgroup is comparable between older and younger patients, and no different to the known 
safety profile of omalizumab. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
No new safety signals have been detected within the CSU trials.  In view of the previously 
characterised safety profile of omalizumab in the treatment of AA, the reported adverse events during 
CSU trials show consistency with this known safety profile.  
There are no outstanding AEs during the extended period of Day 1 to Week 24 that differ from the 
period of Day 1 to Week 12. Long-term clinical trial data of CSU patients beyond 24 weeks study 
treatment plus 16 weeks follow-up is sparse. However, this is balanced by the fact that the product has 
been in use since 10 years and its safety profile well-characterized in patients with allergic asthma 
both in clinical trials and post-marketing setting.  As the reported adverse events during CSU trials 
show consistency with the known safety profile of omalizumab in the treatment of AA and no new 
safety signals have been detected, the data from the AA trials are supportive to the CSU data of an 
acceptable long-term safety profile. 
Overall, the three most frequent AEs were nasopharyngitis, headache, and sinusitis. Other frequently 
reported AEs in both analysis sets were upper respiratory tract infection, cough, and idiopathic urticaria 
and arthralgia.

From a safety point of view there are no concerns in the adolescent group. There is no evidence of a 
different adverse event profile in adolescents; specifically there were no deaths, no SAE related to 
omalizumab and no omalizumab related AE of special interest were reported in these patients. The 
safety of omalizumab in a population aged 6 to <18 years has also been fully explored within large 
clinical trials in a paediatric population with severe allergic asthma. 
The CHMP also concluded that the safety profile associated with the elderly subgroup is comparable 
between older and younger patients, and no different to the known safety profile of omalizumab.

Section 4.4: 
Type I local or systemic allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis 
& anaphylactic shock, may occur when taking omalizumab, also 
with onset after a long duration of treatment. Most of these 
reactions occurred within 2 hours after the first and subsequent 
injections of Xolair but some started beyond 2 hours and even 
beyond 24 hours after the injection. Therefore medicinal products 
for the treatment of anaphylactic reactions should always be 
available for immediate use following administration of Xolair. 
Patients should be informed that such reactions are possible and 
prompt medical attention should be sought if allergic reactions 
occur. 
Anaphylactic reactions were rare in clinical trials. 
No confirmed case of omalizumab related anaphylaxis in Phase

Safety risk addressed in SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8. as 
mentioned below: 
Section 4.4:  
Serum sickness and serum sickness-like reactions, which are 
delayed allergic type III reactions, have rarely been seen in 
patients treated with humanized monoclonal antibodies including 
omalizumab. The suggested pathophysiologic mechanism 
includes immune-complex formation and deposition due to 
development of antibodies against omalizumab. The onset has 
typically been 1-5 days after administration of the first or 
subsequent injections, also after long duration of treatment. 
Symptoms suggestive of serum sickness include arthritis / 
arthralgias, rash (urticaria or other forms), fever and 
lymphadenopathy. Antihistamines and corticosteroids may be 
useful for preventing or treating this disorder, and patients should 
be advised to report any suspected symptoms.

Safety risk addressed in SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8. 
Section 4.4. 
Patients with severe asthma may rarely present systemic 
hypereosinophilic syndrome or allergic eosinophilic 
granulomatous vasculitis (CSS), both of which are usually treated 
with systemic corticosteroids. 
In rare cases, patients on therapy with anti-asthma agents, 
including omalizumab, may present or develop systemic 
eosinophilia and vasculitis. These events are commonly 
associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. 
In these patients, physicians should be alert to the development 
of marked eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary 
symptoms, paranasal sinus abnormalities, cardiac complications, 
and/or neuropathy. 
Discontinuation of omalizumab should be considered in all severe 
cases with the above mentioned immune system disorders.

Arterial thromboembolic events (ATE) 
In controlled clinical trials and during interim analyses of an 
observational study, a numerical imbalance of ATE was 
observed. ATE included stroke, transient ischaemic attack, 
myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and cardiovascular death 
(including death from unknown cause). In the final analysis of the 
observational study, the rate of ATE per 1,000 patient years was 
7.52 (115/15,286 patient years) for Xolair-treated patients and 
5.12 (51/9,963 patient years) for control patients. In a multivariate 
analysis controlling for available baseline cardiovascular risk 
factors, the hazard ratio was 1.32 (95% confidence interval 0.91- 
1.91). In a new analysis of pooled clinical trials, which included all 
randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials lasting 
8 or more weeks, the rate of ATE per 1,000 patient years was 
2.69 (5/1,856 patient years) for Xolair-treated patients and 2.38 
(4/1,680 patient years) for placebo patients (rate ratio 1.13, 95% 
confidence interval 0.24-5.71).

According the outcome from Type II var 046 (CHMP opinion 24–
Oct-2013) the entire wording for malignancy was removed from 
SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8, as there is no indication from 
randomized controlled clinical trials, from the post-marketing 
safety study (EXCELS) or from the post-marketing data, that 
Xolair is associated with an increased risk of malignancies. As 
part of this procedure the RMP was revised to reflect the changes 
of removal of the wording in the SmPC and downgrading of 
Malignant neoplasms in adults and adolescents > 12 years old to 
important potential risk. CHMP opinion is pending, awaiting 
revised RMP to reflect the changes of removal of the wording in 
the SmPC and downgrading of Malignant neoplasms in adults 
and adolescents > 12 years old to important potential risk.

Xolair is indicated in adults, adolescents and children (6 to

patients with convincing IgE (immunoglobulin E) mediated asthma 
(see section 4.2). 
Adults and adolescents (12 years of age and older): 
Xolair is indicated as add-on therapy to improve asthma control in 
patients with severe persistent AA who have a positive skin test 
or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen and who have 
reduced lung function (FEV 1 <80%) as well as frequent daytime 
symptoms or night-time awakenings and who have had multiple 
documented severe asthma exacerbations despite daily high-
dose ICS, plus a long-acting inhaled beta2-agonist. 
Children (6 to <12 years of age): 
Xolair is indicated as add-on therapy to improve asthma control in 
patients with severe persistent AA who have a positive skin test 
or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen and frequent 
daytime symptoms or night-time awakenings and who have had 
multiple documented severe asthma exacerbations despite daily 
high-dose ICS, plus a long-acting inhaled beta2-agonist. 
Section 4.2 
Patients whose baseline IgE levels or body weight in kilograms 
are outside the limits of the dose table should not be given Xolair. 
The maximum recommended dose is 600 mg omalizumab every 
two weeks. 
For subcutaneous administration only. Do not administer by the 
intravenous or intramuscular route. 
The safety and efficacy of Xolair in children below age 6 have not 
been established. No data are available 
In response to increasing off label use in individuals with CIU, a 
development effort is underway to assess efficacy and safety. As 
part of this effort, assessing and characterizing risk for this new 
population is planned.

Safety risk is addressed in section 4.6 and 5.3. of SmPC 
Section 4.6: 
There are limited data from the use of omalizumab in pregnant 
women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful 
effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
Omalizumab crosses the placental barrier and the potential for 
harm to the fetus is unknown. Xolair should not be used during 
pregnancy unless clearly necessary. 
It is un known whether omalizumab is excreted in human milk.

minimization 
measures 
Available pharmacodynamics/toxicological data in non-human 
primates have shown excretion of omalizumab into milk. A risk to 
the new born/infants cannot be excluded. Omalizumab should not 
be given during breast-feeding. 
Section 5.3: 
In reproduction studies in cynomolgus monkeys, subcutaneous 
doses up to 75 mg/kg (about 12-fold exposure ratio based on 28-
day AUC values at 75 mg/kg versus the clinical maximum dose) 
did not elicit maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity 
when administered throughout organogenesis and did not elicit 
adverse effects on foetal or neonatal growth when administered 
throughout late gestation, delivery and nursing. 
Omalizumab is excreted in milk in cynomolgus monkeys. Milk 
levels of omalizumab were 1.5% of the maternal blood 
concentration. 
Phase III CSU Studies: Seven cases of pregnancies have been 
reported for omalizumab in adults and adolescents ≥ 12 years of 
age. There was one pregnant patient in the placebo group in the 
clinical program. One patient underwent therapeutic medical 
abortion and the pregnancy was terminated; the outcome of the 
remaining pregnancies is unknown. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information   
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have 
been updated for Xolair 150 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection and for Xolair 150 mg 
solution for injection in pre-filled syringe. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC was updated to include the QRD statement promoting the reporting of 
suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting systems. 
Additionally, minor amendments were made to sections 4.4 of the SmPC, Annex II and Package 
Leaflet. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The effects of omalizumab are mainly based on the three pivotal phase III studies, Q4881g, Q4882g 
and Q4883g. Study Q4883g was designed primarily for the evaluation of safety, and so no primary 
efficacy endpoint was designed, although the same efficacy analyses were performed as in the other 
pivotal Phase III studies. The results of the primary efficacy endpoint, change from baseline in the 
weekly itch severity score, showed that at Week 12, there was an observed difference between placebo

and 300 mg omalizumab of  -5.80, -4.81 and – 4.52 in studies Q4881g, Q4882g, and Q4883g, 
respectively. The difference is statistically significant and is considered clinically relevant. Minimal 
important differences (MIDs) with respect to changes in individual patients have been defined for the 
composite score and its components and the MID ranges from 4.5 to 5.0 for weekly average of itch 
(Mathias et al 2012).  Patients included in studies Q4881g and Q4882g studies had to be refractory to 
approved doses of H1 antihistamines for inclusion. Given that two-thirds of the efficacy outcome have 
been generated from these two studies (which only had background therapy of an H1 antihistamines) 
and higher doses of anti-H1, antiH2 and LTRA are not approved in Europe for the chronic urticaria 
indication, the indication is restricted as add-on therapy to patients who remain refractory to H1 
antihistamine treatment.  
Clinical trial data on adolescents (12 to 17 years) included a total of 39 patients, of whom 11 received 
the 300 mg dose. Results for the 300 mg are available for 9 patients at week 12 and 6 patients at 
week 24, and show a similar magnitude of response to omalizumab treatment compared to the adult 
population. Mean change from baseline in weekly itch severity score showed a reduction of 8.25 at 
week 12 and of 8.95 at week 24. The responder rates were: 33% at week 12 and 67% at week 24 for 
UAS7=0, and 56% at week 12 and 67% at week 24 for UAS7≤6. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Clinical trial experience of long-term treatment beyond 6 months in this indication is limited. Therefore, 
a statement has been included in section 4.2 of the SmPC to explain that treatment duration should be 
up to 6 months and reassessment for further therapy should occur after this period.  
Only 39  adolescents were included in the studies and only 11 subjects were treated with 300 mg 
omalizumab. Although the group of adolescents is small and not powered to see a statistically 
significant result over placebo, the data comparing the adolescents with adults do show that the 
responses are similar in both groups. Since no differences are known between the pathophysiology of 
CSU in adolescents and adults it is reasonable to extrapolate from adult data to the adolescent group.  
As for the adolescents, the number of elderly subjects is small. Since there is an indication that PKPD 
may be different in adolescents, a similar analysis (within the PKPD model) for the elderly was 
performed. The majority (at least 75%) of elderly patients treated with 300 mg q4w had omalizumab 
trough levels above the EC90 in elderly, similar to the results for patients < 65 years. Differences 
between elderly subjects and patients < 65 years were found for EC50 and Emax. However, 
simulations of well-controlled responder rates suggested that these differences are unlikely to result in 
relevant differences in the clinical response in elderly patients. The CHMP therefore concluded that 
there is no evidence that elderly patients require a different dose from younger adult patients. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
In the pivotal studies of patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), 975 patients between the 
ages of 12 -75 were treated 12-24 weeks. The number of included children between 12-17 years of 
age was 39 (4 % of the study population) whereof 29 received omalizumab. There were no children 
below the age of 12 included. Of the 412 patients who were exposed to the recommended dose of 300 
mg omalizumab every 4th week, 282 were exposed for 21-24 weeks. In the pooled core safety analysis 
of the three pivotal studies in total 404 patients were exposed to  any dose of omalizumab for 21-24 
weeks and only 23 patients extended their exposure to omalizumab >24 weeks.

Overall, the three most frequent AEs were nasopharyngitis, headache, and sinusitis. Other frequently 
reported AEs in both analysis sets were upper respiratory tract infection, cough, and idiopathic 
urticaria. Most of these events were reported at similar rates across treatment groups, with the 
exception of headache, which was reported more frequently relative to placebo in the omalizumab 150 
mg and 300 mg dose groups. Nasopharyngitis, sinusitis, upper respiratory tract infection, arthralgia, 
and pain in extremity were seen slightly more frequently in one or more omalizumab groups relative to 
placebo, while idiopathic urticaria was reported at slightly higher rate in the lower dose (75 mg dose 
omalizumab group), and urticaria was seen least frequently in the 300 mg group over the longer 24-
week treatment period, consistent with superior efficacy at the higher dose.   
The number of reported SAEs was limited and no specific pattern of SAEs has been identified within the 
presented data set. Only the event of angioedema is described in more than one subject and two of 
the cases are referred to the follow-up period as the subjects were taking inappropriate co-
medications.  However, angioedema has been reported also in AA studies as well and is labelled in the 
present section 4.8 (frequency rare) of the SPC addressing AA patients.   
In view of the previously characterised safety profile of omalizumab in the treatment of AA, the 
reported adverse events during CSU trials show consistency with this known safety profile.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Long-term clinical trial data of CSU patients beyond 24 weeks study treatment plus 16 weeks follow-up 
is sparse. However, this deficiency in long-term follow-up is balanced by the fact that the product has 
been in use since 10 years and its safety profile well-characterized in patients with allergic asthma 
both in clinical trials and post-marketing setting.  As the reported  adverse events during CSU trials 
show consistency with the known safety profile of omalizumab in the treatment of allergic asthma (AA) 
and  no new safety signals have been detected, the data from the AA trials are supportive to the CSU 
data of an acceptable long-term safety profile. 
A reduced number of elderly patients have been included in studies and there appears to be some 
imbalances between these age groups in the AES suspected by the investigator. However the CHMP 
concludes that the safety profile associated with the elderly subgroup is comparable between older and 
younger patients, and no different to the known safety profile of omalizumab. 
The number of included children between 12-17 years of age is low making the evaluation of the safety 
profile of CSU patients within this cohort difficult to evaluate. In addition long-term clinical trial data of 
SCU patients beyond 24 weeks study treatment plus 16 weeks follow-up is sparse. These deficiencies 
are balanced by the fact that the product has been in use since 10 years (both in adult and patients 
above from 12 year of age) and its safety profile is well-characterized in patients with AA both in 
clinical trials and post-marketing setting.  In view of the findings that the reported  adverse events 
during CSU trials show consistency with the previously known safety profile of omalizumab in the 
treatment of AA and  that no new safety signals have been detected, the data from the AA trials are 
supportive to the CSU data concerning the above addressed safety aspects. 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
A statistical significant and a clinical relevant effect has been convincingly demonstrated for the 300 
mg dose.  
It is of importance to clearly state that Xolair should be used in combination with antihistamines and 
the wording “Xolair is indicated as add-on therapy for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria in 
Xolair II-48

adult and adolescent (12 years and above) patients with inadequate response to H1 antihistamine 
treatment” clearly describes and reflects the clinical situation. 
The proposed new indication also involves adolescents, 12-17 years. Overall the results for the 
adolescents seem comparable to the results observed in adults. Since no differences are known 
between the pathophysiology of CSU in adolescents and adults it is reasonable to extrapolate from 
adult data to the adolescent group. 
No new safety signals have been detected within the CSU trials.  In view of the previously 
characterized safety profile of omalizumab in the treatment of AA, the reported adverse events during 
CSU trials show consistency with this known safety profile. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The MAH showed that omalizumab has demonstrated a clinical response and a clinical relevant effect 
for the 300 mg dose. No new safety signals have been detected within the CSU trials.   
In conclusion, based on the available efficacy and safety data presented, the benefit risk balance of 
omalizumab as add-on therapy for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria in adult and 
adolescent (12 years and above) patients with inadequate response to H1 antihistamine treatment is 
considered positive. 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
The benefit-risk balance of omalizumab in chronic spontaneous urticaria is positive.

CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE USE 
OF MEDICINAL PRODUCT TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY THE MEMBER STATES 
The Member States should ensure that all conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and 
effective use of the medicinal product described below are implemented: 
The MAH provides educational material to all physicians who may be involved in treating patients 
with prasugrel. 
The format and means of dissemination, of this material should be discussed by the MAH with the 
appropriate learned societies.  The results of the discussion, and where appropriate the material, should 
be agreed with the national competent authority and be available prior to launch in each member state. 
The educational material should include: 
•  A copy of the SPC 
•  Emphasis that: 
o  Severe haemorrhagic events are more frequent in patients ≥ 75 years of age (including 
fatal events) or those weighing < 60 kg 
o  Treatment with prasugrel is generally not recommended for patients of ≥ 75 years of 
o 
age. 
If, after a careful individual benefit/risk evaluation by the prescribing physician, 
treatment is deemed necessary in the ≥ 75 years age group then following a loading 
dose of 60 mg, a reduced maintenance dose of 5mg should be prescribed. 
o  Patients weighing < 60 kg should have a reduced maintenance dose of 5mg 
o  The evidence for a 5mg dose is based only on PK/PD analyses and no clinical data 
currently exist on the safety of this dose in the at risk sub groups.

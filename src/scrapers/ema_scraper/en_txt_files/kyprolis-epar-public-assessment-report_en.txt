2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable disease and accounts for 1% of all cancers and around 10% of all 
haematological malignancies. The incidence in Europe is 4.5–6.0/100 000/year; the mortality is 4.1/100 
000/year (ESMO guidelines 2013). MM is also slightly more frequent in men than in women (approximately 
1.4:1). MM is a disease of older adults. The median age at diagnosis is 66 years; only 10 and 2 per cent of 
patients are younger than 50 and 40 years, respectively (Kyle et al., 2003; Bladé et al., 1998). 
MM is a malignant plasma cell proliferation that occurs within a spectrum of diseases that includes 
monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, primary amyloidosis, non-secretory myeloma, and 
solitary plasmacytoma. The clinical presentation is characterized by anaemia, bone disease, impaired renal 
function, hypercalcaemia, recurrent infections, and hyperviscosity (Myeloma Working Group [IMWG], BJH, 
2003).  
The disease has a typical course characterised by a chronic phase lasting several years, and an aggressive 
terminal phase.According to the ESMO clinical guidelines (2013), the diagnosis is based on the detection of 
the monoclonal component (M protein) in serum or urine, of bone marrow plasma cell infiltration (aspiration 
and/or biopsy), and on the evidence of end-organ damage caused by the proliferative disorder (CRAB 
criteria: hypercalcaemia, renal insufficiency, anaemia, or bone lesions). The International Staging System 
(ISS) identifies three stages according to the combination of β2-microglobulin and of albumin (Greipp et al., 
2005). In addition, cytogenetics evaluated by FISH is a major prognostic factor: recurrent genetic 
abnormalities like t(4;14), deletion(17p), chromosome 1 abnormalities, and t(14;16) are associated with a 
poorer outcome (Sawyer et al., 2011). 
Therapies for myeloma currently consist of the following main classes of agents: proteasome and histone 
deacetylase inhibitors (bortezomib and panobinostat, respectively), immunomodulatory drugs (thalidomide, 
lenalidomide, pomalidomide), corticosteroids, alkylators, anthracyclines, nitrosoureas (to a lesser extent), 
plus high-dose chemotherapy and autologous or allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) 
for those who are eligible. These agents are combined in clinical practice in an attempt to prolong remission. 
Specifically, bortezomib has been combined with dexamethasone (VD) + thalidomide (VTD) or lenalidomide 
(VRD) for induction in young patients, and thalidomide associated with melphalan and dexamethasone (MTD) 
was used as induction regimen in elderly /frail patients; The second/third lines treatment varies according to 
the duration of the previous response and the drugs already given (ESMO guidelines, 2013). Response rates 
decrease with every successive relapse (defined by the IMWG as previously treated myeloma patients who, 
after a period of being off-therapy, require salvage therapy): 58% at 1st relapse to 15% at 4th relapse. The 
prognosis is poor with an expected survival of < 1 year for relapsed and refractory disease (defined as 
relapse of disease in patients who achieve minor response or better, and then either become non-responsive 
while on salvage therapy, or progress within 60 days of last therapy) as compared to an expected survival of 
~ 3 years with relapsed myeloma (Anderson et al. 2008; van de Donk et al. 2011; Kumar et al. 2012; Durie 
et al. 2012).

About the product 
Carfilzomib is a tetrapeptide epoxyketone proteasome inhibitor that selectively and irreversibly binds to the N 
terminal threonine containing active sites of the 20S proteasome, the proteolytic core particle within the 26S 
proteasome, and displays little to no activity against other protease classes. Carfilzomib had antiproliferative 
and proapoptotic activities in preclinical models in haematologic tumours. In animals, carfilzomib inhibited 
proteasome activity in blood and tissue and delayed tumour growth in models of multiple myeloma. In vitro, 
carfilzomib was found to have minimal neurotoxicity and minimal reaction to non-proteasomal proteases 
(SmPC, section 5.1). 
The applicant requested the approval for the following indication: “Kyprolis in combination with lenalidomide 
and dexamethasone is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received 
at least one prior therapy” which was recommended by the CHMP. 
Kyprolis is administered intravenously (IV) as a 10 minute infusion, on two consecutive days, each week for 
three weeks (days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16), followed by a 12-day rest period (days 17 to 28). Each 28-day 
period is considered one treatment cycle. Kyprolis is administered at a starting dose of 20 mg/m2 (maximum 
dose 44 mg) in cycle 1 on days 1 and 2. If tolerated, the dose should be increased to 27 mg/m2 (maximum 
dose 60 mg) on day 8 of cycle 1. Treatment may be continued until disease progression or until unacceptable 
toxicity occurs. Treatment with Kyprolis combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for longer than 18 
cycles should be based on an individual benefit-risk assessment. 
The dose is calculated using the patient’s baseline body surface area (BSA). Patients with a body surface area 
greater than 2.2 m2 should receive a dose based upon a body surface area of 2.2 m2. Dose adjustments do 
not need to be made for weight changes of less than or equal to 20%. From cycle 13, the day 8 and 9 doses 
of Kyprolis are omitted. 
In combination with Kyprolis, lenalidomide is administered as 25 mg orally on days 1–21 and dexamethasone 
is administered as 40 mg orally or intravenously on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of the 28 day cycles. Appropriate 
dose reduction for the starting dose of lenalidomide should be considered according to the recommendations 
in the current lenalidomide summary of product characteristics, for example for patients with baseline renal 
impairment. Dexamethasone should be administered 30 minutes to 4 hours before Kyprolis (SmPC, section 
4.2).

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of the active substance carfilzomib is (2S)-N-((S)-1-((S)-4-methyl-1-((R)-2-
methyloxiran-2-yl)-1-oxopentan-2-ylcarbamoyl)-2-phenylethyl)-2-((S)-2-(2-morpholinoacetamido)-4-
phenylbutanamido)-4-methylpentanamide, corresponding to the molecular formula C40H57N5O7 and has a 
relative molecular mass 719.9 g/mol. The active substance has the following structure (fig. 1): 
Figure 1. Molecular structure of carfilzomib 
The structure of the active substance has been confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR, IR, UV-Vis, elemental analysis 
and mass spectrometry all of which support the chemical structure. Single crystal X-ray diffraction and amino 
acid analysis of an intermediate confirmed the absolute stereochemistry of the 5 chiral centres in the active 
substance. 
Carfilzomib appears as a white to off-white, slightly hygroscopic, crystalline powder. It is practically insoluble 
in water, sparingly soluble in acetonitrile and soluble in ethanol (100%). Its aqueous solubility is pH 
dependent and is higher at low pH values and its pKa is 5.14 and partition coefficient is 3.77.  
Carfilzomib contains five chiral centres [22S, 17S, 10S, 5S, 3R]. Chiral purity is controlled at the level of 
starting materials contributing to carfilzomib’s chiral centres. The manufacturing process yield consistently 
the same crystal form. No evidence of polymorphs or pseudo-polymorphs has been observed during process 
development. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls  
Carfilzomib is synthesized in a 11-step convergent process, split between three manufacturing sites, from 
four well-defined starting materials (SMs) with acceptable specifications. Two variants of the process have 
been presented. The SMs have been defined following a CHMP request so that the critical stereochemistry 
defining steps are under regulatory control. The originally proposed SMs are considered as intermediates in 
the current synthesis. Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and 
control methods for intermediate products and reagents have been presented.  
Following the redefinition of the SMs, at the request of CHMP in review, some of the methods used for SMs 
release and analysis of two of the newly defined intermediates) had not been formally fully validated. It is 
noted that formal verification and validation where necessary for the methods described above have been 
initiated. The applicant commits to report confirmation of verification and validation of these methods to the 
Agency by the end of 1Q 2016 (see 2.2.6 Recommendation(s) for future quality development). Based on the 
Assessment report  
EMA/670306/2015 
Page 11/142 
 
  
  
 
 
 
currently presented information, the methods, as currently performed, are considered adequate to provide 
assurance of quality of active substance especially taking into account the extensive validation of methods 
used at the key control points at relevant intermediates, and the successful routine manufacture of 
carfilzomib meeting the proposed finished active substance specification. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were characterised and were well 
discussed with regards to their origin. Carfilzomib itself is an anticancer drug and as such ICH M7 does not 
apply. However, a conservative approach has been taken and an evaluation of the actual and potential 
structurally related impurities in carfilzomib was performed. Carfilzomib’s epoxide group is identified as a 
structure alert for genotoxicity. However experimental genotoxicity studies showed no evidence of mutagenic 
activity. Therefore, the impurities that contain the epoxide group in the same position and chemical 
environment as in carfilzomib can also be considered non-mutagenic, as it is assumed that these impurities 
would act by the same genotoxic mode of action and would have the same molecular target as carfilzomib. 
Those of the impurities that showed a genotoxic structural alert other than the epoxide structure have been 
either toxicologically qualified or otherwise justified and are appropriately controlled in the active substance 
specification. Overall the presented information and discussion are considered satisfactory. 
The active substance is packaged in a low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bags and stored in a secondary 
container. 
The primary packaging material complies with the comply with the EU Regulation on Plastic Materials and 
Articles Intended to Come into Contact with Food (Reg. 10/2011) for plastic in contact with food and also 
with Monographs 3.1.3 of the European Pharmacopeia (Ph. Eur.). 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests and limits for appearance (visual), solubility (visual), specific 
optical rotation (Ph. Eur.), identification (IR, HPLC), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), water content (Ph. 
Eur.), residual solvents (GC), trifluoroacetic acid content (LC-MS), palladium (ICP-OES), sulphated ash (Ph. 
Eur.), genotoxic impurities , microbial limit test (Ph. Eur.) and bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.). The active 
substance specification and acceptance criteria are shown in table 1 below. 
The omission of testing for polymorphism has been justified based on developmental data and considering 
the pharmaceutical form of Kyprolis. The limit for genotoxic impurities content is established according to 
Guideline on the Limits of Genotoxic Impurities (EMEA/CHMP/QWP/251344/2006 and ICH M7) and in fact the 
proposed limit is 20% of the TTC limit.  
The proposed limits for impurities have been set considering the maximum daily dose (60 mg) and are in 
compliance with the note for Guidance ICH S9 and ICHQ3A(R2), or have been toxicologically qualified  (see 
section 2.3.4). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
have been validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference 
standards of active substance and impurities has been presented.  
Batch analysis results are provided for 25 batches of carfilzomib manufactured using both process variants 
and one batch of active substance manufactured using a combination of the two variants. These 25 batches 
were of varying batch sizes ranging from pilot to commercial scale and have been used in clinical 
development, process validation and stability. In addition batch results of seven batches manufactured using 
earlier processes used only in development have also been provided; these later batches were used during

clinical and non-clinical studies. All results comply with the proposed specifications. The presented results 
confirm the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification.  
Stability 
Stability data on three pilot and nine production scale batches of active substance manufactured at the 
proposed sites using both process variants and stored in packaging intended for marketing for up to 36 
months at 5°C ± 3°C (long-term condition), for up to six months at 25°C ± 2°C/60% ± 5% RH (accelerated 
condition) were provided. Stability studies were conducted according to the ICH guidelines. The samples were 
tested for all parameters included in the release specification. In addition to these, polymorphism has been 
tested by XRD and DSC during stability studies of pilot batches in long term conditions. The other analytical 
methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating.  The stability results for all batches 
have met all acceptance criteria at all time-points both at the long-term and accelerated condition. No 
significant changes were observed.  
Photo stability 
A photo stability study was conducted using one pilot size batch in accordance with ICH Q1B. All samples 
were tested for appearance, assay, identification, impurities, and water content. There was no change in 
appearance, identification, or water content for any samples under all conditions tested. The exposed drug 
substance exhibited increased levels and numbers of impurities showing a clear indication of photo-
degradation which has not been observed in release or stability testing of carfilzomib. However, the UV and 
fluorescent light exposure in the ICH photostability and light stress forced degradation studies is significantly 
higher than the exposure normally encountered during routine manufacturing. Based on the photostability 
studies, carfilzomib active substance is considered stable to light in the commercial packaging configuration, 
and protection from light is not required during production. 
Forced Degradation Studies 
Forced degradation was conducted in solid form (heat, light conditions) and in solution (light, acidic, alkali 
and oxidative conditions) to provide information about degradation products. Various degrees of degradation 
have been observed depending on the stress condition. The analytical methods were shown to be stability 
indicating. 
Based on the stability results submitted the proposed retest period, storage conditions and the proposed 
container are acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Kyprolis is a sterile lyophilized powder for solution for infusion. It is provided in a single-use vial. Prior to use 
each vial is reconstituted with 29 ml of sterile water for injection (WFI) (not supplied) to provide a deliverable 
dose of up to 60 mg Carfilzomib as a 2 mg/ml solution. The reconstituted solution may be diluted with 5% 
dextrose solution.  
During the development a study was performed to confirm the extractable volume of parenteral preparations 
in accordance to Ph.Eur. 2.9.17. Based on this study each vial is filled with adequate volume to allow 
withdrawal of 30 ml volume of reconstituted solution at 2 mg/ml to provide 60 mg carfilzomib.  
Assessment report  
EMA/670306/2015 
Page 13/142 
 
  
  
Carfilzomib active substance is a non-polar ionisable weak base, is practically insoluble in water. The epoxide 
group of carfilzomib degrades over time in aqueous solution therefore, dosage form development focused on 
identification of compositions that could provide adequate stability of carfilzomib while enhancing the 
solubility necessary for the required therapeutic dose. 
Over the course of clinical development a lyophilized carfilzomib formulation was selected as it provides a 
convenient clinical dosing preparation. In addition in order to ensure stability, a major objective of the 
formulation development program was to target a concentration of carfilzomib of 2 mg/ml or higher.  
The aqueous solubility of carfilzomib is pH dependent however the desired carfilzomib concentration could not 
be achieved by pH-control. Moreover, low pH conditions were found to promote degradation and are thus 
unsuitable for clinical administration. The selected pH range for the commercial product has been sufficiently 
justified. 
To achieve an acceptable solubility, well-established methods for solubilisation of hydrophobic 
pharmaceuticals, such as organic co-solvents, surfactants and modified cyclodextrin excipients, were 
evaluated. Initial experiments indicated that cyclodextrins (CDs) were more suitable than the other tested 
means of solubilisation. Sulfobutylether beta-cyclodextrin (SBECD) was selected because it provided 
carfilzomib with the necessary aqueous solubility without precipitation upon dilution, and further studies were 
conducted to select the cyclodextrin type, cyclodextrin concentration, carfilzomib/SBECD ratio and determine 
the optimal pH for a cyclodextrin formulation. 
SBECD enhances carfilzomib solubility, provides isotonicity and acts as a bulking agent in the lyophilized 
cake. SBECD has been used widely as an excipient in parenteral preparations for over 10 years; in Europe 
marketed products including SBECD include Vfend (voriconazole) and Abilify (aripiprazole) injection. 
Therefore it is not considered as a novel excipient. The molecular structure of SBECD is shown below (fig.2). 
Figure 2. Molecular structure of SBECD 
In the absence of a Ph. Eur. monograph it is considered acceptable that SBCED meets the NF requirements. 
With regards to SBECD purity, levels of the unreacted starting material, beta cyclodextrin and levels of the 
genotoxic agent 1,4-butane sultone re controlled in the excipient specification. Considering the therapeutic 
indication, and patient population, the proposed limit for 1,4-butane sultone is appropriate for control given 
the amount of SBECD dosed and the potential dosing duration, as per ICH M7 (Genotoxic Impurities).  
Compatibility of the reconstituted product with the components of typical infusion systems (syringe and 
infusion sets) was evaluated. It can be concluded that light exposure is not a relevant factor to be considered 
and that the reconstituted solution was shown to be compatible with infusion systems tested and for at least 
as long as the duration of administration. 
In addition the compatibility of reconstituted solution with 5% dextrose in 50 ml infusion bags was studied. 
The data provided support the information included in SPC Section 6.3 regarding the in-use shelf-life and 
storage conditions of the reconstituted solution. 
Assessment report  
EMA/670306/2015 
Page 14/142 
 
  
  
 
Also based on the data of the compatibility study with 0.9% sodium chloride, in which a degradation product 
is generated, it is recommended to avoid the use of diluents or IV infusion bags containing chloride, such as 
0.9% sodium chloride (section 6.2 of SmPC). However, it has been adequately justified that flushing the 
intravenous administration line with normal saline (or 5% glucose injection) immediately before and after 
Kyprolis administration, as mentioned in section 4.2 of SmPC, is not a concern taking into account the rate of 
degradation and the infusion time 
An overview and history of the manufacturing process development, equipment and packaging from the early 
development stage through the commercial scale was provided. The process development is well summarized 
and sufficiently documented. The commercial manufacturing process for carfilzomib drug product was 
developed at laboratory scale and verified at pilot and commercial scales. The process steps and critical 
process parameters (CPPs) identified as having an impact on the product quality have been evaluated by 
conducting process characterisation studies.  
Based on results from leachable studies it has been justified and accepted that control of leachables is not 
required. Carfilzomib is a tetrapeptide epoxyketone. High temperature terminal sterilisation is not feasible for 
peptides therefore sterile filtration and aseptic processing are applied to achieve product sterility. The 
selected sterilisation method (sterilisation by filtration) has been adequately justified. 
During development of the lyophilisation cycle, the optimal carfilzomib solution concentration, the freezing 
temperature to achieve solidification, the primary drying temperature and duration to maintain the frozen 
formulation under its glass transition temperature and to reach a complete sublimation below the collapse 
temperature and the secondary drying temperature and duration to remove the bound water or adsorbed 
water were studied. 
In addition a robustness study was carried out to evaluate the impact of variation from set points of shelf 
temperatures and chamber pressures on the lyophilised drug product. The lyophilisation process is 
considered critical. The same lyophilisation cycle was used at both proposed manufacturing sites. The data 
from laboratory scale and commercial scale demonstrate that the lyophilisation cycle to be used in 
commercial production is robust.  
Carfilzomib product/process specific media fill tests have been successfully performed at both sites. Holding 
times have been defined at each site.  
The operating principles of the equipment and the unit operations are the same at both proposed sites. Any 
minor differences related to batch size or manufacturer preferences does not impact product quality. 
Carfilzomib drug product is packaged in a single-use, 50 ml Type I clear glass vial with a 20 mm 
fluoropolymer laminated elastomeric stopper (chlorobutyl rubber) and an aluminium seal with a plastic flip-off 
cap. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The product is manufacture comprises the following main steps: component preparation, compounding, 
sterile filtration, aseptic filling, lyophilisation, capping, inspection and bulk packaging. There are two proposed 
manufacturers. The process has been described in sufficient detailed for both sites. A criticality assessment 
was performed for each unit operation involved in the drug product manufacturing process. The assessment 
was used to define the critical process controls implemented during production to monitor and to ensure in-
process material and finished drug product conforms to the respective specification. In-process control limits 
Assessment report  
EMA/670306/2015 
Page 15/142 
 
  
  
and acceptable operating ranges have been established. Minor differences in the manufacturing process 
between the two sites were represented and are considered acceptable. 
In accordance with Annex II to the guideline on process validation the aseptic manufacturing process by 
sterile filtration in combination with a lyophilisation process is considered a non-standard manufacturing 
process.The commercial manufacturing process was successfully validated at the first manufacturing site on 
with three consecutive commercial scale batches and on the second site with three consecutive batches 
manufactured on each production line. All validation batches met predetermined acceptance criteria 
demonstrating the consistency and the state of control of the process. 
Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf life specifications (table 3) include appropriate tests and limits for this 
kind of dosage form including appearance (visual), reconstitution time, pH of reconstituted solution (Ph. 
Eur.), osmolality (Ph. Eur.), identification (HPLC, HPLC- PDA/UV), assay (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units 
(Ph. Eur.), related substances (HPLC), water content (Ph. Eur.), particulate matter (Ph. Eur.), sterility (Ph. 
Eur.) and bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.). 
The proposed limits for a number of impurities at release and shelf-life exceed the limit of qualification 
defined in the ICH Q3B, considering the MDD defined in the SmPC. However the proposed limits are 
considered qualified in general toxicology and/or genotoxicity studies. In addition, taking into account that 
carfilzomib is intended to treat patients with advanced cancer, no additional testing is required for impurities 
qualification (See section 2.3.4). 
The reconstitution time limit has been set in order to provide adequate time for the foam to dissipate and to 
allow a visual examination to check for particulate matter and to verify carfilzomib has dissolved before dose 
administration. Instructions for reconstitution are provided in section 6.6 of SmPC. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards of active substance and 
impurities has been presented.  
Batch analyses results are provided for 27 batches including batches used in pivotal clinical studies as well as 
primary stability batches and full scale validation batches. Batches were manufactured at different sites 
including the commercial ones. All batches meet the proposed specification limits and confirm the consistency 
of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data on 16 commercial scale batches stored in the intended for marketing packaging and 
manufactured by both the proposed production sites and using active substance manufactured by both 
process variants. Results were provided from samples of finished product and for reconstituted solution 
(following 24 hours storage at ambient temperature) after storage for up to 36 months under long term 
conditions (5°C ± 3°C), for 6 months under accelerated conditions (25°C ±2°C /60% ± 5%RH). In addition 
for another three smaller scale batches, results were provided from samples of finished product and for 
reconstituted solution (following 24 hours  storage at ambient temperature) after storage for up to 36 
months under long term conditions (5°C ± 3°C), for 6 months under accelerated conditions (25°C ±2°C 
/60% ± 5%RH).   
Assessment report  
EMA/670306/2015

The stability attributes tested were: appearance, pH, reconstitution time, assay, related substances, water 
content, particulate matter, sterility. Sterility testing is performed at release and container closure integrity 
testing is performed at all other stability study time points. Acceptance criteria and analytical methods are 
those used for release, except for container closure integrity test (dye ingress test) for which satisfactory 
description and validation has been provided. The stability indicating character of the HPLC methods used for 
assay and related substances has been demonstrated through forced degradation studies. In long-term 
storage condition, a slight decrease of the assay is observed over time with a consistent increase in impurity 
levels; however the stability results for all batches have met all acceptance criteria for the shelf-life 
specification at the long-term storage condition of 5°C ± 3°C for test intervals up to 36 months. At the 
accelerated condition of 25°C/60%RH, the same trend is observed but out of specification result was 
observed for one impurity. 
The stability results were consistent between batches manufactured at the two proposed sites and between 
batches manufactured at different process scales and on different manufacturing lines at each site. 
In-use stability study 
Stability of the solution after reconstitution was assessed after 24 hours of storage at ambient conditions to 
simulate in-use conditions. Samples were taken from the long-term stability studies after 3, 6, 12, 24, 36 
months storage. All reconstituted solution test results meet the shelf-life specification acceptance criteria. 
The SmPC recommendations in section 6.3 are in line with the in use stability results. 
Photostability study 
Photostability of Kyprolis has been assessed as per ICH Q1B “Guideline Photostability Testing of New Drug 
Substances and Product” on 2 development batches representative of the commercial product. Unprotected 
vials exposed to light stress exhibited increased levels of related substances as well as decrease of the assay, 
with out of specification results whereas dark controls and vials protected in the cardboard box had 
comparable results within the specifications. Further to this study, the specific labelling recommendation 
“Retain in original package to protect from light” is included in section 6.4 of SmPC. 
Stress degradation studies 
Stress testing studies (forced degradation) were conducted on the lyophilized product and in solution at high 
temperature, light, acidic, basic and oxidative conditions. The studies showed that potential degradation 
products can be separated and quantified by the analytical method. The degradation products observed 
during long-term and accelerated storage were consistent with the acid-mediated degradation pathway 
observed from the forced degradation studies. 
Temperature excursion study 
A temperature excursion study was performed to evaluate the impact on temperature excursions that may 
occur during shipping, handling and/or dispensing and the results established safe time for temperature 
excursions.  
Based on the overall submitted stability results, the proposed shelf life of 3 years (36 months), with the 
recommended storage conditions “Store in a refrigerator (2C – 8C)”, “Store in the original carton in order to 
protect from light” and “Do not freeze” are acceptable.

Adventitious agents 
No materials of animal or human origin are directly used in the manufacture of the excipients used in 
Kyprolis. 
In the manufacture of the excipient SBECD, an enzyme is used as a starting material. This enzyme is of 
microbial origin but is produced in a fermentation medium containing bovine casein hydrosylate, which in 
turn is manufactured from bovine milk. The cattle, which provide the milk, originate from countries 
designated free from BSE. These cattle are certified healthy and both the animals and the milk itself are fit 
for human consumption. The milk source meets the requirements for control of transmissible spongiform 
encephalopathy. The Note for Guidance on minimising the risk of transmitting animal spongiform 
encephalopathy agents via medicinal products (EMEA/410/01) states “In the light of the current scientific 
knowledge and irrespective of the geographical origin, bovine milk is unlikely to present any risk of TSE 
contamination”. Therefore the TSE risk associated is negligible. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance has been presented in a 
satisfactory manner. The proposed synthetic route and the overall control strategy for the active substance 
are acceptable. The formulation development has been sufficiently explained. SBECD plays a key role in the 
chosen formulation, enhancing carfilzomib solubility. This excipient is used in other products marketed in the 
EU and, consequently, it is not considered to be a novel excipient.  The finished product manufacturing 
process is described in sufficient detail and the controls in place are considered adequate to ensure the 
quality of the product. The choice of the sterilization method has been sufficiently justified and supported by 
data. Kyprolis is manufactured by aseptic processing which is considered as a non-standard process and 
therefore full process validation data have been provided confirming that the manufacturing process is 
capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The proposed finished 
product specification has been justified and is acceptable. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency 
and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
- The applicant should submit validation and verification outstanding methods for starting material 
release and the newly defined intermediates, by the end of 1Q 2016.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The pivotal in vivo non clinical studies were conducted using IV administration. Non-clinical studies were 
conducted in relevant animal models, consistent with ICH guidelines. The main studies were conducted in 
compliance with GLP.  
EMA Scientific Advice was sought to confirm the acceptability of the nonclinical program with respect to the 
nonclinical and clinical assessment of QTc evaluation. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Carfilzomib and bortezomib were tested in vitro against the CT-L, C-L (also known as post-glutamyl peptide 
hydrolase PGPH) and T-L activities of the human 20S proteasome complex by enzymatic assays with 
fluorescence detection (study TR-0004-171).  Carfilzomib and bortezomib were equipotent against CT-L 
activity. Both carfilzomib and bortezomib were time-dependent inhibitors with kinact/Ki values > 30000. 
Carfilzomib was > 300-fold more potent for the CT-L activity than either C-L or T-L activities, while 
bortezomib resulted in potent inhibition of C-L activity (IC50 = 75 nM). 
A study (TR-0031-171) was conducted to evaluate the effects of a brief (1-hour) exposure to carfilzomib on 
proteasome inhibition and apoptosis in human tumour cell lines, including its effects on ubiquitinated protein 
levels, cleavage of caspase 3 and effects on plasma membrane integrity. The human tumour cell lines used 
were human adenocarcinoma (HT-29), human T-lymphoblast (Molt4) and human myeloma (plasmacytoma, 
RPMI-8226). In this study, exposure to carfilzomib led to accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins within 4 
hours, indicating proteasome inhibition. By 24 hours both Molt4 and RPMI-8226 cells showed significant 
caspase 3 activation and apoptosis, whereas HT-29 cells entered cell cycle arrest immediately (24 hours) 
after exposure to carfilzomib, with apoptosis becoming evident at later (72-hours) time points.  
In study TR-0032-171, carfilzomib maintained its cytotoxic potential in bortezomib-resistant cells. In HT-29 
cells resistant to 100 and 200 nM bortezomib there was a 17- and 18-fold resistance to bortezomib, 
respectively, whereas the resistance to carfilzomib was no more than 3-fold. In cells conditioned to 300 nM 
bortezomib, there was a 114-fold increase in resistance compared to 4.3-fold resistance to carfilzomib.  
Carfilzomib induced a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of proliferation, ultimately leading to apoptosis. 
Programmed cell death was associated with activation of c-Jun-N-terminal kinase, mitochondrial membrane 
depolarization, release of cytochrome c, and activation of both intrinsic and extrinsic caspase pathways. This 
agent also inhibited proliferation and activated apoptosis in patient-derived MM cells and neoplastic cells from 
patients with other hematologic malignancies. Importantly, carfilzomib showed increased efficacy compared 
with bortezomib and was active against bortezomib-resistant MM cell lines and samples from patients with 
clinical bortezomib resistance. Carfilzomib also overcame resistance to other conventional agents and acted 
synergistically with dexamethasone to enhance cell death (Kuhn et al, 2007).  
In comparison to bortezomib, PR-171 exhibits equal potency but greater selectivity for the chymotrypsin-like 
activity of the proteasome. In cell culture, PR-171 is more cytotoxic than bortezomib following brief 
Assessment report  
EMA/670306/2015

treatments that mimic the in vivo pharmacokinetics of both molecules. Hematologic tumour cells exhibit the 
greatest sensitivity to brief exposure, whereas solid tumour cells and non-transformed cell types are less 
sensitive to such treatments. Cellular consequences of PR-171 treatment include the accumulation of 
proteasome substrates and induction of cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis (Demo et al, 2007).  
A study in rats was conducted to determine the PD of carfilzomib (TR-0027-171). Proteasome activity 
recovered with similar kinetics following either a single or QDx2 dose administration in rats. Recovery was 
complete within 48 hours of final dose administration for bone marrow and liver and was near complete in 
adrenal gland at this time point. No recovery of proteasome activity was detected in whole blood during the 
course of study. Both single and QDx2 dose administrations were well tolerated in this study. 
Two in vivo studies were conducted to determine the PD of carfilzomib in male Sprague Dawley rats after a 
single dose or the fifth of 5 daily doses (TR-0021-171).  After both single and QDx5 administration, dose-
dependent inhibition in proteasome activity was observed in all tissues examined, with the exception of brain, 
where there was no inhibition of proteasome activity. After five daily doses ofPR-171, proteasome inhibition 
increased in whole blood, PBMCs, heart and lung, where a statistically significant increase in proteasome 
inhibition was noted. Recovery occurred in all tissues, except whole blood, with a t1/2 of ~ 24 hours. 
Recovery was complete in all tissues 9 days after the final dose. 
Proteasome inhibition was observed in whole blood, adrenal glands, bone marrow, liver and PBMC in Sprague 
Dawley rats (TR-0015-171). No proteasome inhibition was detected in brain. Dose dependent inhibition of 
proteasome activity in whole blood 1 hour after the first dose was observed. Partial to complete recovery of 
proteasome activity was seen within 24 hours of dosing in adrenal gland, liver and PBMCs. No recovery of 
proteasome activity was observed within 24 hours of dosing in whole blood (erythrocytes) or bone marrow. 
Carfilzomib mediated an anti-tumor response in HT-29 bearing BNX mice when administered QDx2 at 5 
mg/kg (TR-0037-171).  Bortezomib administered BIW with a 72 hour rest between doses was unable to 
inhibit tumour growth. Carfilzomib treatment was well tolerated and did not induce changes in clinical signs 
or loss of body weight. 
Carfilzomib, at a dose of 1 mg/kg in rats, resulted in equivalent inhibition of the chymotrypsin-like activity of 
the 20S proteasome when delivered as an IV bolus injection or an infusion of either 5 or 30 minutes in length 
(TR-0089-171). No major inhibition of the caspase-like or trypsin-like activities of the proteasome was 
detected with carfilzomib administration at a dose of 1 mg/kg in rats. 
Greater than 80% proteasome inhibition was observed in whole blood and PBMCs one hour after IV bolus 
administration of PR-171 to male Cynomolgus monkeys at 1.0, 1.15, 2.0 and 4.0 mg/kg (TR-0011-171). At 
these near-complete levels of proteasome inhibition, there was no dose-dependency in the pharmacodynamic 
response to PR-171. Recovery in proteasome activity occurred slowly in the erythrocyte compartment, where 
no new protein synthesis occurs.  More rapid recovery in proteasome activity was observed in PBMCs, 
consistent with the observation that nucleated cells are capable of rapid proteasome synthesis following 
inhibition of proteasome activity in vitro. Daily administration (QD x 5) at the well-tolerated dose of 1.0 
mg/kg QD x 5 showed>90% inhibition of proteasome activity in whole blood when tested one hour after 
dosing on Days 1, 3 and 4. 
A single dose pharmacodynamic study was conducted in female cynomolgus monkeys (TR-0046-171). PD 
response for IV-administered orally available tripeptide epoxyketone analog to carfilzomib (PR-58825) in 
blood was slower than the PD response to carfilzomib for some of the cohorts. Animals treated orally with 10 
mg/kg showed partial inhibition of proteasome activity in the adrenal gland, bone marrow, lung, and inguinal 
lymph node which was not statistically significant. Oral administration of 20 mg/kg PR-58825 significantly 
Assessment report  
EMA/670306/2015 
Page 20/142 
 
  
  
inhibited the proteasome activity in all tissues except the adrenal gland and brain. IV administration of PR-
58825 induced proteasome inhibition in all tissues. PR-58825 penetrated the blood brain barrier when 
administered IV. IV treatment of animals with carfilzomib induced proteasome inhibition in all tissues except 
for brain and liver. 
Greater than 80% proteasome inhibition in whole blood was achieved after one dose in doses ranging from 
0.5 – 2 mg/kg carfilzomib (TR-00218-171).  Recovery in whole blood was incomplete due to the irreversible 
mechanism of action of carfilzomib. Approximately 50% proteasome inhibition was observed in heart tissue 
24 hours after the last dose. Proteasome activity recovered completely during the 9 day non-dosing period. 
As a part of a safety pharmacology study in cynomolgus monkeys, the PD of carfilzomib was determined by 
measurement of proteasome CT-L activity in whole blood (TR-0024-171). Inhibition of proteasome activity 
measured in whole blood is presumed to be relatively unchanged over the first 25 hours following irreversible 
inhibition. Erythrocytes are not capable of de novo synthesis of proteasome, and slow recovery is seen over 
several days in whole blood, presumably due to replacement of erythrocytes. The levels of proteasome 
inhibition in whole blood were similar to the ones detected in the the 4-week repeat dose intravenous toxicity 
study of carfilzomib in monkeys. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The inhibitory activities of carfilzomib and bortezomib were studied against a panel of 21 proteases 
representing each major class of non-proteasomal proteases (study TR-0002-171). The criteria for significant 
inhibition was >50% compared to control. At 10 µM, carfilzomib did not result in significant inhibition of any 
protease tested. Human pancreatic chymotrypsin was inhibited by 38%, while all other enzymes tested were 
inhibited by ≤11%. In contrast, bortezomib at the same concentration inhibited cathepsin G (found in 
neutrophils), chymase (mast cells and skeletal muscle) and human pancreatic chymotrypsin by ≥90% as well 
as renin, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and human leukocyte elastase by more than 25%. 
Carfilzomib was tested for the ability to inhibit 67 receptors and 16 non-proteasomal enzymes. Significant 
inhibition was defined as ≥50% (study TR-0003-171). In this study, carfilzomib inhibited the tachykinin 
receptors NK1 and NK2 receptors by 61% and 120% respectively and the sodium channel (site2) by 51%. In 
addition, binding to a few receptors (CCKA, D3, σ, V1a and Cl- channel) was inhibited by 30-50%. In follow-
up experiments, IC50 values for carfilzomib interactions with the NK1 and NK2 receptors were established at 
22 and 0.7 µM, respectively. In an in vitro arterial contraction model, carfilzomib acted as an antagonist of 
the NK2 receptor with IC50 values >100 higher than that for proteasome inhibition.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
An in vitro study (TR-0088-171), evaluated the effects of carfilzomib on the hERG channel (a surrogate for 
Ikr, the rapidly activating, delayed rectifier cardiac potassium current) expressed in human embryonic kidney 
cells. In a preliminary concentration range assay, 2.2 µM carfilzomib produced a 54.2% inhibition of the 
hERG potassium current. Based on this result, additional concentrations of 0.7 and .15 µM were selected to 
evaluate the concentration-response relationship. Carfilzomib inhibited hERG potassium current by 6.9% at 
0.7 µM, 12.7% at 1.5 µM and 54.2% at 2.2 µM. The IC50 was 2.1 µM. Under identical conditions, the positive 
control (60 nM terfenadine) inhibited hERG potassium current by 85.4% (n=2). 
Study TR-0023-171 was conducted to assess the potential cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous 
system effects of carfilzomib when administered IV as a single dose (1, 2, 3 mg/kg, 2 animals/sex/dose) to

conscious telemetered cynomolgus monkeys. Extensive inhibition of whole blood proteasome activity was 
found following a single IV injection of carfilzomib at dosage levels of 1, 2, and 3 mg/kg. There were no 
treatment-related respiratory or primary neurologic effects at any dosage level. Both high-dose males were 
euthanized due to cardiovascular findings and to physical signs in one of the animals. Premature ventricular 
contractions and decreased blood pressure were found in 1 high-dose male, and the other high-dose male 
had increased ST segments and T wave amplitudes, decreases in PR, QRS, and QT intervals, physical signs 
consistent with the poor condition of the animal, decreased blood pressure, increased heart rate, increased 
serum troponin T levels, and macroscopic lesions in the heart. QTc prolongations were not observed. There 
were no cardiovascular findings in males or females at 1 and 2 mg/kg and in females at 3 mg/kg. Irritation at 
the injection sites resulted in the early termination of 2 females at 2 mg/kg and 1 female at 1 mg/kg. The 
NOAEL for the study was 1 mg/kg. The NOAEL for cardiovascular effects was 2 mg/kg. The NOAEL for 
respiratory and neurobehavioral effects was 3 mg/kg. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
At concentrations up to 10 µM, carfilzomib did not inhibit CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19 and 2D6. For CYP3A4, the IC50 
value was 3 and 3.7 µM, respectively, using 7-benzyloxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin and dibenzyl fluorescein 
as the substrate (TR-0034-171). 
Carfilzomib administration also had no notable effect on hepatic total CYP content. The activities of CYP1A 
and 2D appeared to be essentially unaffected by carfilzomib administration (TR-0042-171). CYP2C activity on 
Day 18 at 2 mg/kg decreased to 45 and 53% of controls in males and females, respectively. In males, on 
Day 19, a dose-dependent decrease occurred in CYP2C activity (51, 15 and 6% of controls at 2, 4 and 6 
mg/kg, respectively); in females, a notable increase was noted (approximately 3-fold over the vehicle control 
at 2 and 4 mg/kg). No treatment-related changes in CYP3A activity were noted on Day 18 in male or female 
rats. On Day 19, a notable dose-dependent decrease in CYP3A activity occurred in male rats (67, 41 and 
16% of controls at 2, 4, 6 mg/kg, respectively), whereas only a slight non dose-related decrease occurred in 
females (values were 65, 73 and 73% of controls at 2, 4 and 6 mg/kg, respectively). 
The effects of Carfilzomib on hepatic microsomal protein, hepatic microsomal total cytochrome P450 content 
and activities of selected cytochrome P450 enzymes was assessed in in male and female Cynomolgus 
monkeys (TR-0043-171). No significant changes in CYP2C or 3A activity were observed on Day 19 or 28. On 
Day 28, CYP1A activity was decreased in males and females across all groups without clear dose dependency, 
whereas in samples taken on Day 19 no significant changes in CYP1A activity were seen. 
Carfilzomib did not markedly affect male CYP1A, female CYP2C and male or female CYP3A enzyme expression 
at the concentrations examined (TR-0197-171). In contrast, carfilzomib may decrease female CYP1A and 
increase male CYP2C enzyme expression. Additionally, a dose-dependent decrease in total hepatic CYP 
content was observed in female monkeys treated with carfilzomib. 
Study (TR-0087-171) was conducted to investigate whether carfilzomib is a substrate and/or an inhibitor of 
P-gp using the Caco-2 bidirectional permeability assay. The ability of carfilzomib to serve as a P-gp substrate 
was assessed at the dosing concentrations of 0.1, 1 and 3 µM, whereas the ability of carfilzomib to inhibit P-
gp activity was assessed at the highest soluble concentration of 3 µM. The efflux ratio of carfilzomib ranged 
from 6.3 to 28.6 at carfilzomib concentrations up to 3 µM. The efflux ratio of carfilzomib at 0.1 µM was 
reduced from 12.5 to 1.4 and from 28.6 to 3.8 in the presence of known P-gp inhibitors 10 µM cyclosporine A 
and ketoconazole, respectively. In the assessment of carfilzomib as an inhibitor of P-gp, carfilzomib at 3 µM 
inhibited the efflux transport of digoxin by 25% in the Caco-2 system while the known P-gp inhibitors, 
Assessment report  
EMA/670306/2015 
Page 22/142 
 
  
  
cyclosporine A and ketoconazole at 10 µM, eliminated the efflux transport of digoxin completely. Given the 
very short T½ of carfilzomib in vivo, it is unlikely that even marginal inhibition would last >1 hour. 
The permeability and efflux potential of carfilzomib was assessed in a Caco-2 monolayer system (at 0.3, 1 
and 3 µM) and cell line CPT-B1 (at 1 µM), a proprietary cell line with reduced expression levels of human 
BCRP (TR-0625-171). The efflux ratios of carfilzomib in Caco-2 cells were 5.76, 8.84 and 9.34 at 
concentration of 0.3, 1 and 3 µM, respectively; the efflux ratio was 31.3 in CPT-B1 cells at 1 µM. The relative 
efflux ratio (Caco-2/CPT-B1) was 0.283, smaller than the predefine criteria of 2 to qualify as a BCRP 
substrate, showing that reduced BCRP level did not lead to a decrease in the efflux of carfilzomib. Therefore, 
carfilzomib is not classified as a BCRP substrate.In the assessment of inhibition potential of BCRP, known 
BCRP inhibitor Ko143 decreased the efflux ratio of cladribine from 15.9 to 1.23, achieving essentially a 
complete inhibition of BCRP activity in CPT-P1 cells (a proprietary cell line with reduced expression levels of 
human P-gp). Carfilzomib at 3 µM changed the efflux ratio of cardribine from 15.9 to 12.5, corresponding to 
22.9% inhibition of BCRP activity.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK properties of carfilzomib were evaluated in mice, rats and monkeys, the same species used for 
pharmacology and toxicology studies. Following a single IV bolus administration in mice, rats and monkeys, 
the plasma concentration of carfilzomib rapidly declined in a biphasic manner, with T½ generally lower than 
20 minutes. The systemic plasma clearance was similar or higher than the reported hepatic blood flow for 
each species, indicating that extrahepatic elimination was the predominant clearance pathway. In rats, the 
PK profiles were similar with IV bolus administration using frozen or lyophilized drug products.  
Following a 30 minutes IV infusion to rats at 8 mg/kg, the Cmax (1.55 µM) was achieved within 15 minutes 
of infusion. This value is close to the steady state plasma concentration (Css = 1.25 µM) predicted from the 
clearance value obtained in the IV bolus administration. Compared to the IV bolus administration at the same 
dose, the Cmax was 28-fold lower, whereas the AUC, CL and T½ values were comparable. In addition, the 
level of proteasome inhibition achieved with IV bolus and 30-minute infusion were identical. 
Carfilzomib showed high plasma protein binding in vitro, and has rapid and wide tissue distribution upon IV 
administration in vivo. The highest levels of radiolabel were found in liver, muscle, skin and small intestine. 
At 0.5 and 24 hours after dosing, the tissue to plasma concentration of radioactivity in brain and spinal cord 
was less than 2, suggesting minimal to no penetration of the blood brain barrier, although carfilzomib has not 
been studied in animals with a compromised blood brain barrier. 
Carfilzomib was rapidly metabolized in vitro when incubated in liver microsomes supplemented with cofactor 
NADPH, indicating it is a substrate of CYP450 enzymes. However, additional in vitro and in vivo studies 
showed that the major pathways for metabolic elimination of carfilzomib were peptide cleavage and epoxide 
hydrolysis. In rat blood and tissue homogenates, carfilzomib rapidly disappeared and 2 metabolites (M14 and 
M15) resulting from hydrolysis at peptide bonds rapidly formed. When incubated with hepatocytes, the diol of 
carfilzomib (metabolite M16) was the predominant metabolite, supporting the importance of epoxide 
hydrolysis. In a study conducted in plasma samples from rats and monkeys and in rat bile and urine samples, 
metabolites M14 and M16 were the major metabolites. The role of CYP450 was further assessed in this study, 
showing that the presence of CYP450 inhibitors had minimal effect on the rate of carfilzomib disappearance, 
and indicating that CYP450 enzymes do not play an important role in the metabolic elimination of carfilzomib. 
Major metabolites in humans lack a reactive pharmacophore, so they do not have activity as proteasome 
inhibitors. 
Assessment report  
EMA/670306/2015 
Page 23/142 
 
  
  
Following a single IV administration of 3H-carfilzomib to rats, radioactivity was eliminated slowly such that 
excretion was not complete by 168 hours post dosing.  Urinary and fecal excretion accounted for a mean of 
14.1 and 18% of the administered dose, with and overall recovery of 79.3%. In addition, after a single IV 
dose of carfilzomib to bile-duct-cannulated rats, carfilzomib was mainly excreted in bile and urine in the form 
of metabolites with less than 1% of the dose excreted intact as parent compound. The mean total recovery in 
the form of carfilzomib and metabolites within 24 hours post dose was 56.5% of the dose.  
The inhibitory effect of carfilzomib on CYP450 enzymes (1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A4/5) was evaluated in 
vitro using human liver microsomes. In this study carfilzomib showed modest direct and time-dependent 
inhibition of CYP3A4/5 activity. The time-dependent inhibition was NADPH-dependent and resistant to 
dilution, suggesting that carfilzomib is an irreversible or quasi-irreversible inhibitor of CYP3A4/5.  
The ability of carfilzomib to induce CYP1A2 and 3A4 was evaluated in cultured human hepatocytes, showing 
no induction of the enzymatic activity. No or minimal induction in CYP activity was noted in liver samples 
taken from rats and monkeys after repeated dose administration for 6 and 9 months, respectively. 
Carfilzomib is primarily metabolized via peptidase and epoxide hydrolase activities. Therefore, CYP450-
mediated mechanisms play a minor role in the overall metabolism of carfilzomib. In addition, a metabolism 
study (TR-0212-171) showed that metabolism rate of carfilzomib in human hepatocytes was not affected by 
known CYP450 inhibitors.  
Carfilzomib showed minimal inhibitory effects on P-gp in a Caco-2 monolayer system but was found to be a 
P-gp substrate. However, carfilzomib is not classified as a BCRP substrate and the inhibitory effect of 
carfilzomib on BCRP was minimal. Given that carfilzomib is IV administered and has a short half-life, the PK 
of carfilzomib is unlikely to be affected by P-gp or BCRP inhibitors or inducers in vivo. 
The in vitro studies evaluating the possible inhibitory activity of carfilzomib on some transporters known to be 
involved in clinically relevant in vivo drug interactions (OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, BSEP) 
showed that for OATP1B1, inhibition by carfilzomib has been shown with an IC50=2,01µM.

Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat-dose, GLP-compliant, IV toxicity studies in rats of 1- and 6-months duration were conducted (TR-
0014-171; TR-0072-171).  
In the 1-month study, carfilzomib was administered as an IV bolus at dosage levels of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 
mg/kg (3–36 mg/m2) for 2 treatment cycles (each cycle consisting of 5 consecutive daily doses followed by a 
9-day rest), followed by a 2-week recovery period, equivalent to the dosing schedule of the clinical trial PX-
171-001. In the 6-month study, carfilzomib was administered IV (bolus) at dosage levels of 1, 2, and 4 
mg/kg (6–24 mg/m2) for 3 and 6 cycles of treatment (each 28-day cycle had dosing on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 
and 16; equivalent to the dose schedule used in all other clinical trials) with an 8-week recovery period. In 
the 1-month study, mortality was found at dosage levels ≥ 1 mg/kg, and the cause of death was considered 
cardiac failure (cardiomyopathy). With the change in dosing regimen used in the 6-month study (dosing twice 
weekly rather than for 5 consecutive days), there was no mortality at 1 mg/kg, but mortality was found at ≥ 
2 mg/kg (≥ 12 mg/m2). The cause of death for most of these animals was cardiovascular in nature (cardiac 
fibrosis or cardiac failure), but some deaths were considered due to gastrointestinal haemorrhage/necrosis or 
renal tubular necrosis. In the chronic (6-month) study, decreases in body weight gain in males at all dosage 
levels and decreases in food consumption in males at all dosage levels and females at ≥ 2 mg/kg were 
greatest on the days immediately following dosing, with recovery during the 12-day non-dosing periods at 
the end of each cycle. A variety of clinical pathology findings, particularly at the middle (2 mg/kg) and high 
(4 mg/kg) dose levels, were consistent with stimulated erythropoiesis, acute phase reactions, stress, target 
organ toxicity, or declining physical condition of the animals. Platelet levels were decreased at the terminal 
sacrifice (taken 24 hours after the last dose) but not at the interim or recovery sacrifices, which were 12 and 
47 days after dosing, respectively. Histomorphological changes noted in more than 1 animal/sex were found 
in the kidney (chronic progressive nephropathy), liver (periportal vacuolation), spleen (decreased marginal 
zone cellularity), and mesenteric lymph nodes (increased mast cells). Exposure to carfilzomib and its 3 major 
metabolites (M14, M15, and M16) was generally dose-proportional in males and females. There were no 
gender-related differences in exposure to carfilzomib or its metabolites. Proteasome activity in whole blood 
was inhibited by > 85% at all dosage levels after the first dose and by > 90% after the first doses of Cycles 3 
and 6. Minimal recovery in proteasome activity was found after the 12-day washout periods at all dosage 
levels, consistent with the irreversible mechanism of action of carfilzomib and the inability of erythrocytes to 
synthesize new proteasomes. The STD10 in the chronic rat study was determined to be 2 mg/kg (12 mg/m2) 
based upon the death of 3 animals (1 with uncertain relationship to treatment) at this dose and mortality of 
> 10% in the 4 mg/kg dose group. The no observed adverse effects level (NOAEL) was determined to be 1 
mg/kg. The plasma carfilzomib Cmax and AUClast values (5 minutes as first blood sample time point) in 
males (females) on Day 142 at the STD10 of 2 mg/kg were 519 ± 57 (466 ± 67) ng/mL and 10,215 (9281) 
ng⋅min/mL, respectively.  
The potential toxicity and PD profile of carfilzomib after 2 daily IV injections of 2 mg/kg (24 mg/m2) was 
evaluated in a GLP-compliant study in cynomolgus monkeys (TR-0157-171). IV administration of carfilzomib 
resulted in > 90% inhibition of proteasome activity in whole blood after the first dose. Decreased erythroid 
mass on Days 4 and 5 and decreased reticulocyte counts on Day 4 were followed by recovery of the 
reticulocyte counts by Day 7 and mild erythroid hyper cellularity on Day 7, indicative of responsive bone 
marrow. Decreased platelet counts on Days 2 to 4 were fully recovered by Day 7 and were not associated 
with megakaryocyte changes in the bone marrow. Mild to moderate increases on Day 2 in serum urea, 
associated with mild increases in serum creatinine and increased urine specific gravity, were consistent with 
pre-renal azotaemia and were fully recovered by Day 3. Decreases in serum albumin were associated with 
increases in plasma fibrinogen and serum C-reactive protein (CRP), and this constellation of findings was 
Assessment report  
EMA/670306/2015 
Page 26/142 
 
  
  
consistent with an acute-phase reaction; full recovery was found by Day 7. Increased serum troponin I values 
were transient in 3 animals that did not have microscopic evidence of myocardial toxicity and were persistent 
in 1 animal that also had increases in serum AST and ALT and myocardial lesions (degeneration and vascular 
congestion). 
Repeat-dose, GLP-compliant, IV toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys of 1 and 9 months duration were 
conducted (TR-0017-171; TR-0073-171). In the 1-month study, carfilzomib was administered IV (bolus) at 
dosage levels of 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/kg (6-24 mg/m2) for 2 treatment cycles (each cycle consisting of 5 
consecutive daily doses followed by a 9-day rest). In the 9-month study, carfilzomib was administered IV 
(bolus) at dosage levels of 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/kg (6–24 mg/m2) for 9 cycles of treatment (each cycle consisted 
of 2 consecutive days of dosing per week for 3 weeks, followed by a 12-day rest), with an 8-week recovery 
period. In the 1-month study, with daily dosing for 5 consecutive days, a dosage level of 2 mg/kg (24 
mg/m2) resulted in the premature death in 6 of 10 monkeys during the first cycle of administration; the 
cause of death was cardiac toxicity (inflammation, haemorrhage, necrosis, oedema) and/or pulmonary 
haemorrhage and oedema. In the 9-month study, the same dosage levels were used as in the 1-month 
study, but the dosing regimen was reduced from 5 to 2 consecutive daily doses weekly (i.e., the current 
regimen being submitted for approval). With the reduction in dosing frequency, mortality still occurred at 2 
mg/kg (24 mg/m2), but the incidence was decreased to 2 of 12 animals at Days 132 and 157. Proteasome 
inhibition at this dose level was ≥  85%. The cause of death in the monkeys on the 9-month study was 
multiorgan toxicity, including cardiac inflammation, pulmonary inflammation and oedema, renal dysfunction, 
or, in 1 female, declining physical condition, associated with severe no regenerative anaemia associated with 
decreased bone marrow cellularity, severe hypoalbuminemia associated with subcutaneous swelling, and 
moderate increases in liver enzymes, particularly ALT and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), associated with 
marked diffuse hepatocellular glycogen accumulation in the liver. Decreases in erythroid parameters (RBC, 
haemoglobin, and haematocrit) at all dosage levels, characterized by recovery during non-treatment periods 
and associated with increased reticulocyte counts, were consistent with a regenerative anaemia. Similarly, 
decreased platelet counts just after drug administration, associated with increased platelet counts at the end 
of cycles (after a 12-day nondosing period), at 2 mg. The plasma clearance appeared to increase as 
carfilzomib dose increased. As a consequence, both Cmax and AUClast values of carfilzomib increased less 
than dose proportionally. The data from the TK investigations showed that exposure did not change following 
repeat-dose administration and was similar between genders. Inhibition of proteasome activity in whole blood 
was > 80% after the first dose and > 90% in Cycles 3, 6, and 9 at all dosage levels, with little recovery 
during the non-dosing periods, consistent with the irreversible mechanism of action of carfilzomib and the 
inability of erythrocytes to synthesize new proteasomes. The HNSTD was considered to be 0.5 mg/kg (6 
mg/m2) and was associated with > 80% proteasome inhibition in the blood after the first dose. Similar 
proteasome inhibition (80% to 90% is achieved with doses of 20 to 27 mg/m2 in humans). The plasma 
carfilzomib Cmax and AUClast values (5 minutes as first blood sample time point) in males (females) on Day 
225 at the HNSTD of 0.5 mg/kg were 43.1 ± 4.6 (47.5 ± 9.4) ng/mL and 804 ± 99 (886 ± 148) ng⋅min/mL, 
respectively.

Other toxicity studies 
The impurity profiles of carfilzomib batches used in toxicology studies are provided in quality section.  
A standard genotoxicity battery to support qualification of carfilzomib impurities per ICH guidelines Q3A and 
Q3B was performed.  Further studies in the chromosome aberration test in human lymphocytes and the 
mouse micronucleus were carried out using carfilzomib spiked or not with impurities:  There were no 
unexpected findings and no mutagenic risk at the levels tested related to the impurity profile of carfilzomib. It 
should be noted thatone impurity is both a potential drug substance impurity and drug product degradant, is 
also a major metabolite of carfilzomib in rats, monkeys, and humans.  
A structure-based in silico programwas performed to assess the structure-activity relationship (SAR) for 
carfilzomib and the identified degradation products Only one degradation product observed in carfilzomib 
drug product has a structural alert for genotoxicity and this impurity is both a drug substance impurity and a 
drug product degradation product. The impurity showed a mutagenic structural alert for alkylating agent 
resulting from the alkyl chloride group. This impurity has been evaluated in experimental in vitro and in vivo

genotoxicity studies and the results showed no evidence of mutagenic activity. This impurity is controlled by 
the drug product specifications.  
One study (TR-0424-171) was conducted in mice in order to assess the toxicity of carfilzomib and bortezomib 
in mice receiving a sublethal challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and to profile the plasma levels of 
cytokines in mice receiving carfilzomib, LPS, or the combination. Carfilzomib at 3 and 5 mg/kg pre or post 
LPS challenge resulted in 100% mortality. Same dosing without challenge did not result in mortality. 
Combination of carfilzomib at 3 or 5 mg/kg or bortezomib and LPS resulted in 3 – 10 fold increases in serum 
urea, creatinine, liver transaminase and creatine kinase levels, similar findings to carfilzomib at 10 mg/kg 
with. Carfilzomib administration at 5 and/or 10 mg/kg resulted in a mild elevation (10-100 fold less than LPS 
alone) of the cytokines granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulation factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-1α (IL-1α) 
and the chemokines KC (keratinocyte-derived chemokine 1, a mouse ortholog of CXCL1/IL-8), and 
interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10). No significant increase in the cytokines tumour necrosis factor α 
(TNF-α), IL-1β, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), or IL-6 were induced by carfilzomib. Carfilzomib administered 1 hr prior 
to LPS resulted in a significant increase of the release of RANTES, MCP-1, IL-6, IL-1β, IFN-γ, and IL-17 
measured 6 or 12 hr after endotoxin challenge. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The Applicant has submitted an ERA based on the guideline on “Environmental risk assessment of medicinal 
products for human use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00). 
The logKow for carfilzomib has been determined analytically by titration to be to 3.77, which is below the 
threshold of 4.5. Therefore a PBT assessment was not deemed necessary. 
The PEC surfacewater has been calculated using a refined Fpen value which was based on carfilzomib’s 
orphan designation. The value obtained was 0.000825 µg/L, which is below the action threshold of 0.01 µg/L 
and, therefore, a phase II assessment was not required.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In the in vitro studies, carfilzomib showed to be a potent, selective and irreversible inhibitor of the 
chymotrypsin-like (CT-L) activity of purified human 20S proteasome and was 50- to 300-fold selective over 
the other proteasome catalytic activities caspase-like (C-L) and trypsin-like (T-L). In vivo, carfilzomib showed 
more potent cytotoxic activity against both haematological and solid tumour cell lines than C-L inhibitor 
bortezomib, with haematological tumour cell lines being most sensitive to such treatments. Continuous 
exposure to carfilzomib was associated with more potent cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic activity as compared to 
brief exposure in different tumour cells. In addition, carfilzomib was cytotoxic to bortezomib-resistant cells.    
The PD of carfilzomib was determined in vivo in rats and monkeys by measurement of CT-L proteasome 
activity in tissue extracts, showing a dose-dependent proteasome inhibition 1 hour after administration in all 
tissues examined except the brain. Recovery of proteasome activity in tissues had a t½ of approximately 24 
hours, while in whole-blood samples (enucleated erythrocytes), recovery was slower, likely due to the 
inability of mature erythrocytes to synthesize new proteasomes and the relatively slow rates of red blood cell 
turnover. This slow turnover of RBCs together with the irreversible inhibitory activity of carfilzomib is also 
likely the reason of cumulative proteasome inhibition. The kinetics of recovery from proteasome inhibition 
after multiple doses was similar to that after a single dose. Administration of carfilzomib as a 30-minute 
infusion resulted in similar levels of proteasome inhibition as an IV bolus administration, suggesting that the 
PD response is a function of the total dose and not maximum concentration, as expected for an irreversible 
inhibitor. 
With regards to safety pharmacology, carfilzomib inhibited the hERG current at all tested concentrations from 
0.7µM, with an estimated IC50 of 2.1 µM.  An in vivo, cardiovascular toxicity was detected with premature 
ventricular contractions, decreased blood pressure, increased ST segments and T wave amplitude, decreases 
in PR, QRS and QT intervals, increased heart rate and serum troponin T levels and macroscopic lesions in the 
heart . However, no QTc prolongations were observed in vivo. In addition, there were lack of ECG findings in 
Cynomolgus monkey and rat however the animal exposure was lower than human exposure. Taken together, 
despite hERG inhibition, the non-clinical data suggest no specific pro-arrhythmic potential for carfilzomib. A 
combined safety pharmacology study has been conducted with carfilzomib in telemetered monkey after IV 
administration. No effect was observed on CNS or respiratory parameters at dose up to 3 mg/kg. However, 
carfilzomib induced cardiovascular toxicity after IV administration at 3 mg/kg (36 mg/m2) in monkey. At 1 
and 2 mg/kg, carfilzomib seems to be better tolerated. In view of the effect of myocardium observed during 
repeat-dose toxicity studies, the cardiovascular findings in monkey were likely due to myocardial toxicity (see 
discussion on clinical safety).  
In vitro, carfilzomib inhibits OATP1B1 with an IC50=2,01 µM whereas it is unknown whether carfilzomib may 
or not inhibit other transporters OATP1B3,OAT1, OAT3, OCT2 and BSEP, at systemic level. Nonetheless, 
considering the fast elimination of carfilzomib, notably 5 minutes after starting infusion, the risk of clinically 
relevant interactions with substrates of these transporters is probably low (SmPC section 4.5). 
Carfilzomib is a P glycoprotein (P gp) but not a BCRP substrate. However, given that Kyprolis is administrated 
intravenously and is extensively metabolised, the pharmacokinetic profile of carfilzomib is unlikely to be 
affected by P gp or BCRP inhibitors or inducers. In vitro, at concentrations (3 µM) lower than those expected 
at therapeutic doses, carfilzomib inhibits the efflux transport of digoxin, a P gp substrate, by 25%. Caution 
Assessment report  
EMA/670306/2015 
Page 32/142 
 
  
  
should be observed when carfilzomib is combined with substrates of P gp (e.g. digoxin, colchicine) (SmPC 
section 4.5). 
The ability of carfilzomib to induce CYP1A2 and 3A4 was evaluated in cultured human hepatocytes, showing 
no induction of the enzymatic activity. No or minimal induction in CYP activity was noted in liver samples 
taken from rats and monkeys after repeated dose administration for 6 and 9 months, respectively. 
In addition, despite that some metabolites (M14, M15, M16) have high exposures in human plasma, no 
information regarding its possible CYP inhibition or induction has been submitted by the Applicant. According 
to the Guideline on the investigation of drug interactions (CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev. 1) the potential inhibitory 
and induction effects of metabolites on CYP should be considered. M14, M15 and M16 are Phase I metabolites 
with an AUC both larger than one fourth of the AUC of the parent drug and larger than 10% of the drug 
related exposure; therefore in vitro testing of their activity on CYP is warranted. These studies are ongoing 
and the applicant was recommended to submit the final results. 
The PK properties of carfilzomib were evaluated in mice, rats and monkeys.  Following a single IV bolus 
administration the plasma concentration of carfilzomib rapidly declined in a biphasic manner, with T½ 
generally lower than 20 minutes. The systemic plasma clearance was similar or higher than the reported 
hepatic blood flow for each species, indicating that extrahepatic elimination was the predominant clearance 
pathway. These studies suggested that the PD effect of carfilzomib depends on the total dose administered 
and not the Cmax. 
Carfilzomib showed high plasma protein binding in vitro, and has rapid and wide tissue distribution upon IV 
administration in vivo. Minimal to no penetration of the blood brain barrier was detected. Carfilzomib was 
rapidly metabolized in vitro when incubated in liver microsomes, indicating it is a substrate of CYP450 
enzymes. However, additional in vitro and in vivo studies showed that the major pathways for metabolic 
elimination of carfilzomib were peptide cleavage and epoxide hydrolysis, with three major metabolites 
common to animals and humans. Following a single IV administration of 3H-carfilzomib to rats, radioactivity 
was eliminated slowly such that excretion was not complete by 168 hours post dosing.   
In vitro studies indicated that carfilzomib did not induce human CYP3A4 in cultured fresh human hepatocytes. 
A clinical trial using oral midazolam as a CYP3A probe demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics of midazolam 
were unaffected by concomitant carfilzomib administration, indicating that carfilzomib is not expected to 
inhibit the metabolism of CYP3A4/5 substrates and is not a CYP3A4 inducer in human subjects. However, it is 
unknown whether carfilzomib is an inducer of CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19 and 2B6 at therapeutic 
concentrations. Caution should be observed when carfilzomib is combined with medicinal products that are 
substrates of these enzymes, such as oral contraceptives. Effective measures to avoid pregnancy should be 
taken, an alternative method of effective contraception should be used if the patient is using oral 
contraceptives (SmPC section 4.5). 
Monkeys administered a single bolus intravenous dose of carfilzomib at 3 mg/kg (which corresponds to 36 
mg/m2  and is similar to the recommended dose in humans of 27 mg/m2 based on BSA) experienced 
hypotension, increased heart rate, and increased serum levels of troponin T. The repeated bolus intravenous 
administration of carfilzomib at ≥  2 mg/kg/dose in rats and 2 mg/kg/dose in monkeys using dosing 
schedules similar to those used clinically resulted in mortalities that were due to toxicities occurring in the 
cardiovascular (cardiac failure, cardiac fibrosis, pericardial fluid accumulation, cardiac 
haemorrhage/degeneration), gastrointestinal (necrosis/haemorrhage), renal (glomerulonephropathy, tubular 
necrosis, dysfunction), and pulmonary (haemorrhage/inflammation) systems. The dose of 2 mg/kg/dose in 
rats is approximately half the recommended dose in humans of 27 mg/m2 based on BSA.  The highest non-
Assessment report

severely toxic dose of 0.5 mg/kg in monkeys resulted in interstitial inflammation in the kidney along with 
slight glomerulopathy and slight heart inflammation. Those findings were reported at 6 mg/m2 which are 
below the recommended dose in humans of 27 mg/m2  (SmPC section 5.3).  
Carfilzomib was clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration test in peripheral blood lymphocytes. 
Carfilzomib was not mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) test and was not clastogenic 
in the in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay (SmPC section 5.3). 
Fertility studies with carfilzomib have not been conducted. No effects on reproductive tissues were noted 
during 28-day repeat-dose rat and monkey toxicity studies or in 6-month rat and 9-month monkey chronic 
toxicity studies. Carfilzomib caused embryo-foetal toxicity in pregnant rabbits at doses that were lower than 
in patients receiving the recommended dose. Carfilzomib administered to pregnant rats during the period of 
organogenesis was not teratogenic at doses up to 2 mg/kg/day , although carfilzomib exposure in animals 
was below the exposure achieved in humans (SmPC section 4.6). 
Kyprolis is not recommended during pregnancy and in women and men of childbearing reproductive potential 
not using effective contraception. Female patients of child bearing potential (and/or their partners) must use 
effective contraception measures during and for one month following treatment. It cannot be excluded that 
the efficacy of oral contraceptives may be reduced during carfilzomib treatment (s. In addition, due to an 
increased risk of venous thromboembolic events associated with carfilzomib, females should avoid the use of 
hormonal contraceptives that are associated with a risk of thrombosis during treatment with carfilzomib. If a 
patient is currently using oral contraceptives or a hormonal method of contraception that is associated with a 
risk of thrombosis, the patient should switch to an alternative method of effective contraception (SmPC 
section 4.6). 
Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, Kyprolis can cause foetal harm when administered 
to a pregnant woman.  Kyprolis should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the 
woman requires treatment with Kyprolis. If Kyprolis is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes 
pregnant while taking this drug medicinal product, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to 
the foetus (SmPC section 4.6). 
It is unknown whether carfilzomib or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Based on its 
pharmacological properties, a risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. Consequently, as a precautionary 
measure, breast feeding is contra indicated during and for at least 2 days after treatment with Kyprolis 
(SmPC section 4.6). 
The local tolerance of carfilzomib has been evaluated within the repeat-dose toxicity studies. Macro and 
microscopic analysis of the injection site were performed during repeat-dose toxicity studies in rat and 
monkey. Minimal to moderate inflammation, oedema and haemorrhage were reported are observed at the 
injection site in some monkeys. Those findings suggest that IV injected carfilzomib was slightly irritant. 
With regards of the Environmental Risk Assessment of the product the LogKOW value has been provided but 
no data has been included in the dossier on how this calculation was performed. The study on which logKOW

005 and PX-171-007) 
Absorption 
The Cmax and AUC following a 2- to 10-minute intravenous infusion of 27 mg/m2 was 4232 ng/mL and 379 
ng•hr/mL, respectively. Following repeated doses of Kyprolis at 15 and 20 mg/m2, systemic exposure (AUC) 
and half-life were similar on days 1 and 15 or 16 of cycle 1, suggesting there was no systemic carfilzomib 
accumulation. At doses between 20 and 36 mg/m2, there was a dose-dependent increase in exposure (SmPC 
section 5.2). 
Distribution 
The mean steady-state volume of distribution of a 20 mg/m2 dose of carfilzomib was 28 L.  When tested in 
vitro, the binding of carfilzomib to human plasma proteins averaged 97% over the concentration range of 0.4 
to 4 micromolar (SmPC section 5.2). 
Elimination 
Carfilzomib was rapidly and extensively metabolised. The predominant metabolites measured in human 
plasma and urine, and generated in vitro by human hepatocytes, were peptide fragments and the diol of 
carfilzomib, suggesting that peptidase cleavage and epoxide hydrolysis were the principal pathways of 
metabolism. Cytochrome P450 mediated mechanisms played a minor role in overall carfilzomib metabolism. 
The metabolites have no known biologic activity (SmPC section 5.2). 
Assessment report  
EMA/670306/2015 
Page 37/142 
 
  
  
 
 
Following intravenous administration of doses ≥  15 mg/m2, carfilzomib was rapidly cleared from the systemic 
circulation with a half-life of ≤  1 hour on day 1 of cycle 1. The systemic clearance ranged from 151 to 263 
L/hour, and exceeded hepatic blood flow, suggesting that carfilzomib was largely cleared extrahepatically. 
Carfilzomib is eliminated primarily via metabolism with subsequent excretion of its metabolites in urine 
(SmPC section 5.2). 
Dose proportionality - Time dependency 
Dose-proportionality of Carfilzomib during Study PX-171-007 was evaluated using a Power Model. A linear 
relationship was evaluated between the natural log-transformed (ln-transformed) PK parameters AUC0-last, 
AUC0-inf, and Cmax and the ln-transformed dose on Days 1 and 16 of Cycles 1, 3, and 5. Results are shown in 
Table 12. 
Table 9. Dose Proportionality Assessment of Carfilzomib in solid tomur (2-10 minutes IV 
perfusion) – Days 1 and 16 Combined (Study PX-171-007) 
In the final population PK analysis, the interindividual variability (IIV) for each parameter, expressed as 
percent coefficient of variation (%CV), was 60% for CL, 119% for V1, and 49% for V2. 
Special populations 
Two population PK analyses were conducted: an interim analysis (Studies PX-171-003 – Part1 (A0)/ PX-171-
003 – Part 2 (A1), PX-171-004, PX-171-005, PX-171-006 and PX-171-007) and a final analysis to incorporate 
PK data from subjects in Phase 3 PX-171-009 study. Exposure metrics derived from the final model are 
consistent with the non-compartmental analysis of carfilzomib PK. 
Among the covariates tested in the population PK analyses [interim analysis: age, weight, height, body mass 
index, sex, race , CrCl, dexamethasone use (dose level per day as continuous variables or categorical y/n 
variables), lenalidomide dose (continuous variable), degree of renal impairment (mild/moderate/severe), 
treatment cycle and disease type (solid tumor yes/no); final analysis: CrCl, body weight, BSA, age, race, sex, 
and disease type (multiple myeloma versus solid tumor)], only CrCL was identified as statistically significant 
covariate in the interim analysis and BSA in the final analysis.

Renal Impairment 
In case of CrCl, an effect of CrCl on central compartment carfilzomib CL was observed: in subjects with 
severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min), CL was reduced by approximately 20% with a large degree of 
overlap from the typical value for subjects with full renal function.  
In relation with BSA, it corresponds to a 13% decrease in CL in a subject with the lowest BSA of 1.37 m2 and 
a 19% increase in a subject with the highest BSA of 2.82 m2 relative to those with the median BSA value of 
1.9 m2. Additionally, carfilzomib dose was calculated using the subject’s actual body surface area at baseline 
and subjects with a body surface area greater than 2.2 m2 received a dose based upon a body surface area 
of 2.2 m2. 
A special population study (PX-171-005) was conducted in 50 multiple myeloma subjects with various 
degrees of renal impairment (normal, mild, moderate, severe and chronic dialysis), receiving an initial dose 
of 15 mg/m2, which could be escalated to 20 mg/m2 starting in Cycle 2 if 15 mg/m2 was well tolerated in 
Cycle 1. No apparent differences in carfilzomib CL, AUC, and Cmax between subjects with normal and those 
with varying levels of renal functional impairment following single- or repeat-dose administration has been 
detected (results shown in Table 13). 
Table 10. Summary of PK Parameters of Carfilzomib in Plasma after 20 mg/m2 IV Injection (Day

In addition, a second renal impairment study (CFZ001) was conducted meanly to characterize the 
pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of carfilzomib 56 mg/m2 using a 30-minute infusion in patients with ESRD. 
In this study lenalidomide has not been administered together carfilzomib. The results are presented in Table

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In study PX-171-008, the PK of midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A was evaluated after single and repeat dosing 
of carfilzomib at 27 mg/m2. Results are shown in Table 16.

Mechanism of action 
No clinical studies addressing the mechanism of action were submitted. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Intravenous carfilzomib administration resulted in suppression of proteasome chymotrypsin-like (CT-L) 
activity when measured in blood 1 hour after the first dose. Doses of ≥ 15 mg/m2 consistently induced an (≥ 
80%) inhibition of the CT-L activity of the proteasome. In addition, carfilzomib administration resulted in 
inhibition of the latent membrane protein 2 (LMP2) and multicatalytic endopeptidase complex-like 1 (MECL1) 
subunits of the immunoproteasome ranging from 26% to 32% and 41% to 49%, respectively, at 20 mg/m2.  
Little to no inhibition of the other subunits of the constitutive proteasome (Beta1 and Beta2) was seen 
following an initial dose of carfilzomib. This suggested that the majority of the activity was intact in tissues 
that predominantly express this form of the proteasome (eg, liver, kidney, and heart). However, data from 
Cycle 2 showed a trend to fast increase the inhibition of the Beta1 and Beta2 subunits of the constitutive 
proteasome with subsequent cycles (Table 17). No data are available about further subsequent cycles.

Because carfilzomib is an irreversible inhibitor of the proteasome, there is no recovery of proteasome activity 
in enucleated erythrocytes. In contrast, PBMCs are capable of proteasome turnover, and thus recovering 
from carfilzomib-induced proteasome inhibition (Meiners 2003). However, minimal recovery in PBMC was 
noted on Cycle 1 Day 2, demonstrating that proteasome inhibition was prolonged (≥ 48 hours) following 
consecutive-day dosing. The full recovery was still not achieved after a 5-day nondosing period (Day 8, 
predose). Complete or near-complete recovery of proteasome activity was observed in PBMCs between 
cycles, and no change in proteasome content was noted in these cells.  
The levels (> 80%) and durations (≥ 48 hours) of proteasome inhibition achieved with carfilzomib at 20 and 
27 mg/m2 in subjects were greater than that reported with bortezomib (Papandreou 2004; Orlowski 2002). 
In these studies, maximal inhibition of CT-L activity, measured using an enzymatic assay similar to the one 
performed in the studies described here, was ~65% with complete or near-complete recovery in 72 hours. 
QT Effects 
In the linear mixed model, the effect of carfilzomib on cardiac repolarization using the QTcF interval and the 
concentration-QTc relationships seems to show no clear signal of any dose-related effect. The upper CI for 
predicted effect on QTcF and QTcB at Cmax based on the concentration-QTc model was 4.8 msec and 5.9 
msec, respectively. However, the results of the ECG Central Tendency with the correction of Fredericia or 
Bazett in the individual studies and in the combination report showed that the upper bound of the two- side 
90% CI (equal to one-side 95%) around the mean effect on QTc were over 10 msec at several time points 
(PX-171-005, PX-171-007). Results are reported in Table 18.

Exposure-response Analysis 
Two exposure-response analysis for carfilzomib were conducted: exploratory exposure-response analysis (PX-
171-003 – Part 2 (A1), PX-171-004, PX-171-005, PX-171-006, and PX-171-007) and updated exposure–
response analysis, adding Phase 3 PX-171-009 study (ASPIRE). 
In the exploratory Exposure-response analysis, a relationship between carfilzomib Cycle 1, Day 1 AUC and 
response category was identified, with higher AUC exposures seen in subjects with responses (minimal 
response [MR], partial response [PR], very good partial response [VGPR], and complete response [CR]) 
compared to those without response (stable disease [SD] or progressive disease [PD] or unknown). No 
relationship between safety endpoints and carfilzomib exposure metrics was evident at that time. 
In the updated Exposure-response analysis from the PX-171-009 study using the 20/27 mg/m2 dose regimen 
did not identify any apparent relationship between exposure and efficacy endpoints, including PFS (primary 
efficacy endpoint) and ORR/CBR. In a pooled analysis across 15- to 20/56-mg/m2 dose levels statistically 
significant relationships between carfilzomib AUC.C1avg and response rates were identified by logistic 
regression. The multiple logistic regression analysis also identified several statistically significant covariate 
effects for ORR and CBR, including subjects refractory to bortezomib, baseline platelet count ≥ 150 (109/L), 
combination therapy with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, and race. The odds ratios relating to the other 
covariates generally describe larger effects than the one relating to PK exposure. In the pooled analysis for 
safety endpoints, no statistically significant relationships between either AUC or Cmax and increased AE 
incidence were found. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Carfilzomib and its metabolites parmacokinetics has been overall characterized from a dose range of 15 to 70 
mg/m2 with several PK studies with different population, regimens and doses of carfilzomib and two 
population PK analyses. PK parameters from the sparse PK sample studies (PX-171-003, PX-171-004, PX-
171-006 and PX-171-009) seem to be in line with PK parameters from the intensive PK studies (PX-171-005 
and PX-171 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate there are no effects of age or gender on the pharmacokinetics 
of carfilzomib. 
Renal function status had no effect on the clearance or exposure of carfilzomib following single or repeat-
dose administration at doses up to 20 mg/m2 (SmPC section 5.2). No data of dose of 27 mg/m2 have been 
provided in the study of subjects with renal impairment. Preliminary results of a second renal impairment 
study (CFZ001) have been submitted however, several limitations should be further discussed and justified in 
the final clinical report of study CFZ001. The final results of this study will be provided (see Risk Management 
Plan).  
Administration of lenalidomide and dexamethasone has been included as covariates in the interim population 
PK analysis. Additionally, combination dosing with lenalidomide and dexamethasone did not seem to affect 
proteasome inhibition in PD estudies. However, data with concomitant use of lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone are limited. Lenalidomide is poorly metabolized and a majority of lenalidomide is eliminated 
through urinary excretion. Carfilzomib will be maineanly eliminated in urine as metabolite M14 or 
incorporated into normal biosynthetic pathways due to its peptidic nature and its irreversible bindings to its 
target. Interaction at renal level cannot be fully ruled out. Additionally, renal AEs have been observed with 
both drugs. In studies where lenalidomide were administered together carfilzomib (PX-171-006 and pivotal 
Assessment report  
EMA/670306/2015 
Page 44/142 
 
  
  
PX-171-009) population were restricted to patients with a CrCl ≥  50 ml/min, due to the recommendation of 
reduction for the starting dose of lenalidomide for patients with baseline renal impairment. 
Appropriate dose reduction for the starting dose of lenalidomide in patients with baseline renal impairment 
should be considered according to the recommendations in the lenalidomide Summary of product 
characteristics. No starting dose adjustment for Kyprolis is required in patients with baseline mild, moderate, 
or severe renal impairment or patients on chronic dialysis. Since dialysis clearance of Kyprolis concentrations 
has not been studied, the medicinal product should be administered after the dialysis procedure. In phase 3 
clinical studies the incidence of adverse events of acute renal failure was higher in subjects with lower 
baseline creatinine clearance than that among subjects with higher baseline creatinine clearance (SmPC 
section 4.2). 
No dedicated pharmacokinetic studies have been completed in patients with hepatic impairment (SmPC 
section 5.2). A hepatic impairment study (Study CFZ002) is currently ongoing to examine the PK of 
carfilzomib at higher doses (up to 56 mg/m2) in subjects with hepatic impairment. In light of preliminary 
results, no modification of the dose recommendation in subjects with hepatic impairment has been proposed. 
However, the final results of this study will be provided (see Risk Management Plan). 
Regarding dexamethasone, carfilzomib is not expected to inhibit CYP3A4/5 or other CYP substrates and it is 
not an inducer of CYP3A4. Thus, carfilzomib as perpetrator is not expected to influence the exposure of 
dexamethasone. As victim, dexamethasone (as a weak to moderate inducer of CYP3A4) is not expected to 
affect carfilzomib exposure, since CYP-mediated pathways do not appear to play a significant role in the 
overall metabolism of carfilzomib. 
The inhibition of Beta1 and Beta2 observed in cycle 2 of patient whole blood samples (which is primarily 
composed of red blood cells) does not reflect the inhibition levels in organ tissues that have the ability to 
synthesize new proteasome and recovery activity. The volume of whole blood required to assay Beta1 and 
Beta2 activity in tissues such as liver, kidney, and heart made this analysis impractical. 
The potential for carfilzomib to induce CYP450 isoforms (1A2 and 3A4) in cultured fresh human hepatocytes 
was evaluated in study TR-0086-171.Carfilzomib was not an inducer of CYP1A2 or 3A4 at the concentrations 
tested (0.1, 0.5, 2.5 µM). Instead, carfilzomib caused a reduction in both CYP1A2 and 3A4 catalytic activity 
for all 3 donors in a concentration-dependent fashion. A concentration-dependent decrease in CYP3A4 mRNA 
expression was also observed when the hepatocytes were treated with carfilzomib, suggesting that the 
reduction of CYP3A4 activity may be partially attributable to CYP3A4 mRNA down-regulation. Treatment with 
carfilzomib at the concentrations tested did not cause cytotoxicity. 
An evaluation of possible effects of carfilzomib on cardiac function was performed by analyzing, via central 
blind reading, triplicate ECG in 154 subjects with advanced malignancies, including multiple myeloma.  The 
effect of carfilzomib on cardiac repolarization using the QT interval with Fridericia’s correction (QTcF interval) 
and the analysis of concentration QTc relationships show no clear signal of any dose-related effect.  The 
upper bound of one-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for predicted effect on QTcF at Cmax was 4.8 msec. 
With Bazett’s correction (QTcB interval), the upper bound of one-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for 
predicted effect on QTcB at Cmax was 5.9 msec (SmPC section 5.1). 
There have been cases of QT interval prolongation reported in clinical studies. An effect of Kyprolis on QT 
interval cannot be excluded (SmPC section 4.8). 
The difference in the exposure-response results between the PX-171-009 study analysis and the pooled 
analysis could be due to the high clinical response (98/102 subjects included in analysis achieved at least a 
Assessment report

PR) in PX-171-009, a relatively narrow range of plasma exposures achieved within PX-171-009 as a result of 
a single dose level evaluated (ie, 20/27 mg/m2), and the potential confounding effect in the pooled analysis 
of differences in subject characteristics and regimens across studies that tested different doses of carfilzomib.  
Due to the high variability in exposure parameter, PBMC percent CT-L activity data may be a more sensitive 
predictor of efficacy and safety outcomes across these studies that carfilzomib exposure metrics alone. 
Additionally, the sparse sampling strategies utilized across some of the studies may have limited the 
precision of estimated carfilzomib exposure metrics. In any case, the potential confounding effect in these 
pooled analyses of differences in subject characteristics and regimens across studies that tested different 
doses of carfilzomib cannot be avoided; thus, these exposure response analyses are only considered as 
exploratory and supportive analyses. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Carfilzomib and its metabolites pharmacokinetics have been reasonably well investigated in a dose range of 
15 to 70 mg/m2 with several PK studies with different population, regimens and doses of carfilzomib and 
population PK analyses. The studies submitted as part of the clinical pharmacology were considered 
acceptable to investigate the PK and PD aspects of carfilzomib. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
PX-171-001 was an open-label, dose-escalation safety trial with the primary objective of charactering dose 
limiting toxicities (DLTs) and identifying the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of calfilzomib given as an IV 
bolus over 2 min at doses from 1.2 to 20 mg/m2 for 5 times per week in a 14-day cycle in subjects with 
previously treated hematologic malignancies including myeloma. All 29 treated subjects experienced 1 or 
more AEs. The most common AEs regardless of grade or causality were nausea, fatigue (each in 48.3% of 
subjects), and diarrhea (34.5%). Although no subject discontinued study due primarily to an AE, AEs 
contributed to treatment interruption or discontinuation in 4 cases. AEs indicative of neuropathy were not 
common, showed no dose relationship, and were all grade 1 or 2 in severity. Ten SAEs were reported among 
6 subjects. Three of the 10 SAEs were considered possibly related to carfilzomib (febrile neutropenia, chills, 
and neutropenia). No subject died during treatment. At the 20 mg/m2 dose level, 2 subjects experienced 
DLT: grade 4 thrombocytopenia and grade 3 febrile neutropenia and chills—all considered possibly related to 
carfilzomib. Consequently, 15 mg/m2 was considered to be the MTD of carfilzomib when administered daily 
for 5 consecutive days. 
The stepped-up dosing was then tested in PX-171-002, an open-label phase 1 study of escalating dose levels 
of carfilzomib administrated from 1.2 to 20mg/m2 twice weekly (D1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16) for 3 weeks, 
followed by 1 week of rest in 28-day cycle. Up to 86 subjects with various haematologic malignancies were 
planned. The study was divided into a sequential dose escalation phase (Part 1), followed by a dose 
expansion period (Part 2) consisting of: A) a carfilzomib-only cohort and B) a carfilzomib-plus 
dexamethasone cohort.  
During the escalation phase across carfilzomib dose levels, objective responses were observed at the higher 
carfilzomib doses: between 15 and 27 mg/m2 in 5 of 27 evaluable subjects (4 PRs and 1 MR) and were seen

Page 46/142 
 
  
  
only in subjects with MM. Considering subjects with a PR, the response rate was 14.8% (95% CI: 4.2, 33.7). 
Including the MR, the overall objective response rate was 18.5%. Responses generally occurred early in 
treatment, with all 4 PRs documented during Cycle 1. Median PFS for the 27 evaluable subjects was 176.0 
days (95% CI: 54.0, 239.0).Through the carfilzomib dose of 27 mg/m2, the MTD was not reached in this trial. 
Hence, the minimally effective dose on this schedule appeared to be carfilzomib 15 mg/m2 given in a regimen 
of once daily, twice per week, during 3 weeks in a 4-week cycle.  
During the expansion period, 7 patients entered the dose expansion phase of Study PX-171-002 and treated 
with a starting dose of 20/27 mg/m2; 4 were treated with a starting dose of 20/27 mg/m2 with 
dexamethasone. No additional efficacy was observed with addition of low-dose dexamethasone (40 mg/week; 
120 mg/28-day cycle), either upon examination of the patients who received carfilzomib + dexamethasone 
beginning with the first dose in Cycle 1 Day 1 or of the 1 patient with stable disease in whom dexamethasone 
was added on Cycle 3 Day 1. One patient out of 4 receiving carfilzomib + dexamethasone experienced a drug 
related SAE (hypoxia) as well as 3 AEs that were considered to be dose limiting toxicities (DLTs); these 
consisted of grade 3 elevations in alkaline phosphatase and liver transaminases (ALT and AST). No patient 
receiving single-agent carfilzomib experienced an adverse event (AE) considered to be a DLT. 
On the basis of this trial, a dose of 20 mg/m2 followed by a dose of 27 mg/m2 (“the step up program”) was 
recommended for future studies in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies to reduce adverse 
events associated with carfilzomib infusion. 
The study PX-171-006 was the basis for the selected dosed of CRd in subjects with relapsed multiple 
myeloma. In this phase 1b dose-escalation study, both carfilzomib (15, 20 or 20/27mg/m2) and lenalidomide 
(10, 15, 20 or 25mg/day) were escalated in sequential cohorts in combination with low-dose dexamethasone 
(40mg/week). Subjects received carfilzomib (15-27 mg/m2) IV over 10 minutes on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 
16 of a 28-day cycle (Day 8 and 9 doses could have been omitted at the investigator’s discretion for C13 and 
higher), along with lenalidomide (10-25 mg) and dexamethasone until progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
The primary endpoint was to evaluate safety and the MTD of carfilzomib with lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone. All subjects (100.0%) had at least 1 AE, the majority of which were Grade 1 and 2 in 
severity. At least one Grade 3 or higher AE was experienced in 95.2% subjects and 53.6% had at least 1 
SAE. A total of 14 subjects (16.7%), including 10 subjects (19.2%) in the MPD group, discontinued treatment 
due to an AE, and 4 subjects (all in the MPD group) had at least 1 carfilzomib dose reduction due to an AE. 
Seventy-eight (92.9%) subjects experienced at least 1 treatment-related AE. A total of 3 subjects (3.6%) 
died on study; deaths were due to progressive disease (n = 2) and natural causes/underlying disease (n = 
1). The MTDs of carfilzomib and lenalidomide were not reached in this study

Objectives 
The primary objective of the pivotal study was to compare progression-free survival (PFS) in subjects with 
relapsed multiple myeloma receiving carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (CRd) versus subjects 
receiving lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd). 
The secondary objective was the comparison of the effect of CRd versus Rd on the following: overall survival 
(OS), overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DOR), change over time 
in the Global Health Status/Quality of Life of the EORTC Quality of Life Core Module QLQ-C30 (QLQ-C30 
GHS/QoL) and safety. 
The Exploratory objective was to compare the two treatment arms in terms of Time to progression (TTP), 
Additional health-related quality of life (HRQL) subscales of EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-MY20, Time to next 
treatment and Clinical benefit rate (CBR). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was PFS assessed by IRC, defined as the duration in months from the date of 
randomization to the date of confirmed progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever was 
earlier, according to the International Myeloma Working Group - Uniform Response Criteria (IMWG-URC), 
reported in Table 19.

Table 16. Summary of International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response Criteria (IMWG-
URC)  
Secondary endpoints included overall survival (defined as duration in months from randomisation to death 
due to any cause), overall response rate (proportion of subjects who achieved a best response of sCR, CR, 
VGPR or PR according to IMWG-URC),  duration of response (duration in months from the date of initial start 
of response [PR or better] to the earlier date of documented PD or death due to any cause [for ORR and DCR 
separately]) disease control rate (defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved a best response of 
sCR,CR, VGPR, PR, MR, or SD lasting ≥  8 weeks [MR was determined using EBMT criteria]), duration of 
disease control (defined as the duration in months from randomization to the earlier date of start of PD or 
death due to any cause for subjects who achieved disease control),  Change over time in EORTC QLQ-C30 
Global Health Status/QoL scale and safety and tolerability as determined by assessments of treatment-
emergent AEs, laboratory values, vital signs, and ECGs. 
Exploratory endpoints included  time to progression (defined as the duration in months from the date of 
randomization to the date of documented disease progression), clinical benefit rate  (defined as the 
proportion of subjects who achieve a best response of sCR, CR, VGPR, or PR according to IMWG-URC, or MR, 
according to the EBMT criteria), time to next treatment (defined as the duration in months from the date of 
randomization to the date of initiating subsequent anti-myeloma therapy) and additional HRQL subscales of 
EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-MY20.

Sample size 
An estimated 526 PFS events were needed to provide 90% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.75 (a 25% of 
risk reduction for the CRd regimen compared with the Rd regimen). 
A median PFS of 11.2 months for the Rd arm was expected based on results from two Phase 3 studies of 
lenalidomide/dexamethasone in relapsed myeloma patients with a history of 1 to 3 prior therapies 
(Dimopoulos 2007; Weber 2007). The required number of PFS events was determined based on a 1-sided 
log-rank test with an overall type I error rate of 0.025 (which is equivalent to 0.05 for 2-sided tests) under 
the group sequential monitoring plan. 
The original design had the planned sample size of 700 subjects to achieve the required PFS events in 36 
months assuming 18 months of enrolment and additional 18 months of follow up. As a consequence of the 
1st interim analysis the sample size was increased to approximately 780 subjects in order to decrease the 
time to reach the required number of events. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomized to receive either CRd or Rd with a ratio of 1:1 and they were planned to start 
study treatment within 5 days of randomisation. Randomization was stratified based on:  
1. β2 microglobulin levels (< 2.5 mg/L vs. ≥  2.5 mg/L) 
2. Prior bortezomib versus no prior bortezomib  
3. Prior lenalidomide versus no prior lenalidomide 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
The response and progressive disease outcomes were determined by the local investigator and also by the 
IRC in a blinded manner periodically throughout the trial. The primary analysis of PFS was performed using 
the ITT population based on subjects’ outcomes as determined by the IRC.  
For subjects meeting one of situations as following, the primary analysis of PFS was right-censored according 
to the conventions described in Table 20.

Table 17. Date of Progression or Censoring for Progression-Free Survival 
The PFS was assessed using following pre-specified sensitivity analyses: 
- 
- 
PFS assessed by local investigators 
PFS assessed by the Sponsor using a computer-based algorithm ORCA (Onyx Response 
Computational Assessment) in a central, independent and blinded manner. 
-  Un-stratified Analysis 
-  Analysis using interval censoring. The interval was constructed as follows: (1) if the PFS event is PD, 
then interval will be (date of last assessment before PD, date of the assessment indicating PD]; (2) if 
the PFS event is death, then interval will be [date of death, date of death]; and (3) if no PFS event is 
observed, then the interval will be (date of last assessment,]. 
- 
Initiation of non-protocol anti-cancer therapy treated as PFS Event. PFS was broadly defined as 
duration from randomization to documented disease progression, initiation of non-protocol anti-
cancer therapy, or death, whichever occurs earlier. 
- 
Initiation of non-protocol anti-cancer therapy treated as neither a PFS Event nor a Censoring Event. 
The data censoring rules are the same as those for the primary analysis of PFS except that the 
initiation of non-protocol anti-cancer therapy was excluded as a mechanism for censoring. 
-  Analysis based on Scheduled Assessment Dates instead of Actual Assessment Dates. The impact on 
the analysis of PFS due to potential systematic difference in disease assessments between treatment 
arms was assessed.

Per-Protocol Analysis

Up to 3 analyses of PFS were planned: 2 interim analyses by the Independent Data Monitoring 
Committee (IDMC) and 1 final analysis. The first interim analysis was occurred in December 2011 only for 
administrative purposes for blinded re-evaluation of sample size and did not include a comparison 
between 2 arms. Based on the IDMC recommendation, the sample size was increase from 700 to 780 
subjects in order to decrease the enrolment time. The total required number of PFS events 526 remained 
unchanged. The second interim analysis was planned when approximately 420 (80%) of 526 planned 
total events were observed, which provides 90% power to detect a target HR of 0.75. As of the 16 June 
2014 data cut-off date, this pre-specified interim analysis was trigged on 431 IRC-assessed PFS events. 
The IDMC assessed the efficacy and safety results of this interim analysis and recommended stopping the 
study for efficacy, but to continue for safety and OS monitoring.

Recruitment 
The date of the first patient enrolled was 14 July 2010. During the period of 14 July 2010 and 16 June 2014 
(data cut-off date), a total of 956 subjects with relapsed MM were screened. A total of 792 subjects were 
randomized from 129 sites in 20 countries located in Europe, North America and Israel. 
Conduct of the study 
An overview of the protocol amendments, all implemented prior to the data cut-off date, is reported in Table 
21.

A total of 4 subjects (2 in each study arm) had an important protocol deviation resulting in exclusion from the 
PP Population as defined in the SAP. Three subjects did not meet key selection criteria (1 subject in each 
study arm had received > 3 prior treatments; and 1 subject in the CRd arm was intolerant to previous 
lenalidomide or dexamethasone treatment); and 1 subject in the Rd arm used concomitant anticancer 
therapy before discontinuing study treatment. 
A total of 151 (19.1%) subjects had other important protocol deviations. These include an additional 1.5% (6 
subjects) in each study arm with deviations related to inclusion or exclusion criteria. 
Protocol deviations related to deviations in drug administration routine occurred in 117 subjects (14.8%), 
which were balanced between the 2 study arms. Corticosteroids for nonmalignant conditions (asthma, 
inflammatory bowel disease) equivalent to a dexamethasone dose of > 4.0 mg/day or prednisone > 20 
mg/day were not permitted per protocol. A total of 37 subjects in the CRd arm and 34 subjects in the Rd arm 
received corticosteroids for nonmalignant conditions for short-term medical use to treat AEs (range of 1–10 
days in the CRd arm and 1–27 days in the Rd arm). A total of 17 subjects in the CRd arm and 25 subjects in 
the Rd arm remained on study beyond 1 cycle (30 days) after confirmed investigator assessment of disease 
progression per IMWG. Reasons for keeping subjects on study treatment past progression included delay in 
receiving laboratory reports or clinical judgment by the investigator before a final assessment of progression 
could be made. There were 5 subjects (4 in the CRd arm and 1 in the Rd arm) who received higher than 
prescribed doses of dexamethasone (1 or 2 doses) or lenalidomide (1 dose). One of these 5 subjects reported 
Grade 2 vomiting with a single higher dose (80 mg versus the prescribed dose of 40 mg) of dexamethasone; 
no other subjects reported new or worsening AEs. Two subjects continued to receive carfilzomib after Cycle 
18, Day 16 due to a site error. Once the issue was identified, these subjects continued to receive carflizomib 
during the follow-up phase as new antimyeloma therapy. 
There were 22 subjects (2.8%) who were randomized to the wrong strata via the IVRS system and analyzed 
according to their assigned stratum. The issues were related to β2 microglobin levels (20 subjects), and prior 
lenalidomide (1 subject, CRd arm) and bortezomib (1 subject, Rd arm) where the sites selected the wrong 
value on the telephone keypad (< 2.5 mg/L or ≥  2.5 mg/L for β2 microglobin; no or yes for prior 
lenalidomide or bortezomib exposure).

a 
The primary analysis refers to primary, stratified analysis of PFS using the disease outcomes assessed 
by the IRC and the prespecified censoring rules. The sensitivity analyses deviate from the primary 
analysis with respect to disease outcome assessor (IRC, investigators, sponsor), analysis methods 
(stratified, unstratified, bias adjusted, right censored, interval censored), censoring rules (e.g., 
censoring by the initiation of non-protocol, anti-cancer therapy vs. not initiating such therapy) and 
assessment schedules (observed vs. scheduled). 
b 
Analysis after adjusting for the bias due to stopping at interim was based on Emerson and Fleming 
(1990). Adjusted hazard ratio (95% CI) and p-value were based on the statistics from a stratified log-
rank test. 
Secondary endpoint: Overall Survival

months (95% CI: 23.1, 30.4) in the CRd arm and 21.0 months (95% CI: 16.6, 25.0) in the Rd arm. 
Secondary endpoint: Disease Control Rate 
The DCR was 92.7% (95% CI: 89.7, 95.0) in the CRd arm versus 87.1% (95% CI: 83.4, 90.3) in the Rd arm 
(Odds Ratio = 1.90 [95% CI: 1.17, 3.08]; p = 0.0044). As determined by the investigators, the DCR was 
94.2% (95% CI: 91.4, 96.3) in the CRd arm versus 89.1% (95% CI: 85.7, 92.0) in the Rd arm (Odds Ratio 
= 1.99 [95% CI: 1.17, 3.38]; p = 0.0048). As determined by ORCA, the DCR was 91.7% (95% CI: 88.5, 
94.2) in the CRd arm versus 88.1% (95%CI: 84.5, 91.1) in the Rd arm (Odds Ratio = 1.48 [95% CI: 0.93, 
2.37]; p = 0.0487). 
Secondary endpoint: Duration of Disease Control 
As of the data cut-off date, a total of 51.2% of subjects who achieved a best overall response of SD (≥  8 
weeks) or better in the CRd arm and 56.2% in the Rd arm had either progressed and/or died. The median 
DDC was 28.7 months [95% CI: 24.4, 31.6] in the CRd arm and 18.9 months [95% CI: 16.6, 22.2]) in the 
Rd arm. 
The median DDC as determined by the investigators was 27.1 months (95% CI: 24.1, 31.4) in the CRd arm 
versus 18.2 months (95% CI: 15.9, 21.9) in the Rd arm. The median DDC as determined by ORCA was 27.1 
months (95% CI: 24.1, 31.4) in the CRd arm versus 18.9 months (95% CI: 16.6, 22.0) in the Rd arm. 
Secondary endpoint: Global Health Status/Quality of Life Scale of the EORTC Quality of Life Core Module 
QLQ-C30 
Using a restricted maximum likelihood-based mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) analysis under the 
assumption of missing at random (MAR), subjects treated with CRd reported improved global health status 
with higher QLQ-C30 Global Health Status/QoL scores compared with Rd over 18 cycles of treatment (p-value 
= 0.0001).) The MID is 5 points according to the literature (Cocks 2011; Kvam 2010; Kvam 2011; Delforge 
2012), and this MID was met at Cycle 12 (5.56) and approached at Cycle 18 (4.81) when comparing CRd 
versus Rd (Results shown in Table 32 and in Figure 5).

The model included the fixed, categorical effects of treatment, visit, and treatment-by-visit; the fixed, continuous 
covariates of baseline HRQL score and baseline score-by-visit, as well as the randomization stratification factors:  β2 
microglobulin levels (< vs. ≥ 2.5 mg/L), prior bortezomib (no vs. yes), and prior lenalidomide (no vs. yes) as fixed factors. 
Random subject effect was modeled using within subject error correlation structure.

CRd arm versus 93.2% in the Rd arm completing the questionnaires. As a proportion of the randomized 
study population, just under half of subjects completed the QLQ-C30 questionnaire (47.3%) at Cycle 18. A 
higher proportion of subjects randomized to CRd completed the QLQ-C30 questionnaire at each cycle 
compared to Rd subjects. This difference was largest at Cycle 18, with 57.3% in the CRd arm versus 37.4% 
in the Rd arm, respectively. The questionnaires were completed by subjects up to Cycle 18 or until disease 
progression or death, whichever occurred first, and at End of Treatment. Given there were more subjects

who progressed in the Rd group, the difference in QLQ-C30 completion rates was to be expected, as shown in 
Table 32. 
Exploratory Efficacy Endpoint: Time to Progression 
A total of 42.2% of subjects in the CRd arm and 50.5% in the Rd arm had progression of multiple myeloma 
by the time of the data cut-off. The median TTP was 31.4 months [95% CI: 26.4, NE] in the CRd arm and 
19.4 months [95% CI: 16.6, 23.2] in the Rd arm. The median follow-up for disease progression was 30.6 
months (95% CI: 29.5, 31.4) in the CRd arm and 29.3 months (95% CI: 27.8, 30.5) in the Rd arm. 
Exploratory Efficacy Endpoint: Clinical Benefit Rate 
The CBR was 90.9% [95% CI: 87.6, 93.6]) in the CRd arm and 76.3% [95% CI: 71.8, 80.4] in the Rd arm. 
Among the responders, the median duration of clinical benefit was 28.3 months [95% CI: 24.3, 30.5] in the 
CRd arm and 20.3 months [95% CI: 16.6, 24.0] in the Rd arm. 
Among the responders, the median duration of clinical benefit (DCB) was 28.3 months [95% CI: 24.3, 30.5] 
in the CRd arm and 20.3 months [95% CI: 16.6, 24.0] in the Rd arm. 
As determined by investigators, the CBR was 91.4% (95% CI: 88.2, 94.0) in the CRd arm and 75.3% (95% 
CI: 70.7, 79.4) in the Rd arm; the median duration of clinical benefit was 27.6 months (95% CI:23.3, 31.3) 
in the CRd arm and 19.3 months (95% CI: 16.5, 23.9) in the Rd arm. 
Exploratory Efficacy Endpoint: Time to Next Treatment 
A total of 38.1% of subjects in the CRd arm and 46.5% of subjects in the Rd arm had started a new anti-
myeloma treatment by the time of the data cut-off. Among subjects who received new anti-myeloma 
therapy, the median time from randomization to new treatment was 17.3 months [range: 0.46–37.6]) in the 
CRd arm and 12.1 months [range: 0.26–33.5] in the Rd arm. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of median time to 
next treatment among all randomized subjects was also longer in the CRd arm (37.6 months [95% CI: 31.8, 
NE]) than in the Rd arm (24.5 months [95% CI: 20.8, 32.8]). The median follow-up for next therapy was 
31.5 months (95% CI: 30.7, 32.0) in the CRd arm and 30.0 months (95% CI: 29.3, 31.2) in the Rd arm.

Study PX-171-004  
This was a single-arm phase 2 study evaluating carfilzomib monotherapy at 20 and/or 20/27 mg/m2 in 
bortezomib-treated (Part 1, N=35) and bortezomib-naïve (Part 2, N=129) subjects with relapsed MM after 1 
to 3 prior lines of therapy, but not refractory to standard first-line therapy. The median time on carfilzomib 
treatment was 3.3 months and in the bortezomib-treated cohort, subjects with relapsed or refractory disease 
after a median of 3 prior therapeutic treatments were enrolled. The primary endpoint was ORR.  
The IRC-assessed ORR for the bortezomib-treated cohort was 16.1% (95% CI: 5.5% to 33.7%).  In the 
Bortezomib-naïve cohort treated with 20 mg/m2, the IRC-assessed ORR was 39.6% (95% CI: 26.5% to 
54%).In the Bortezomib-naïve cohort treated with 20/27 mg/m2, the IRC-assessed ORR was 53.0% (95% 
CI: 40.3% to 65.4%) and the CBR was 65.2% (95% CI: 52.4% to 76.5%).  
Study PX-171-006 
This was a phase 1b, open-label, multicentre, dose-escalation study evaluated the combination of carfilzomib 
(15 to 20/27 mg/m2) in combination with lenalidomide (10 to 25 mg) and low-dose dexamethasone (40 mg) 
in subjects with relapsed MM, 1 to 3 prior lines which may have included bortezomib, lenalidomide and/or 
thalidomide. The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CRd. 
A total of 58 subjects in the overall response-evaluable population (n = 83) achieved a best response of PR 
or better, with 34 subjects achieving VGPR or better. The ORR was 69.9% (95% CI: 58.8% to 79.5%) in this 
population, and included 4 subjects with a CR. The CBR was 77.1% (95% CI: 66.6% to 85.6%) and the DCR 
was 85.5% (95% CI: 76.1% to 92.3%). The median PFS was 14.6 months (95% CI: 7.9 to 23.7 months) 
and the median TTP was 14.8 months (95% CI: 9.9 to 23.7 months). The responses were durable with a 
median DOR of 18.8 months (95% CI: 9.7 to 33.4 months). For the 58 subjects who achieved a response of 
PR or better, the median TTR was rapid, at 0.95 month (range: 0.5 to 29.9 months).

EMA/670306/2015

In the maximum planned dose cohort (MPD), the ORR by Onyx’s computational algorithm was 78.4% 
(95%CI: 64.7% to 88.7%) and 3 of the 4 subjects who achieved CRs in this study were treated in the MPD 
cohort. The CBR in the MPD cohort was 78.4% (95% CI: 64.7% to 88.7%) and the DCR was 84.3% (95% 
CI: 71.4% to 93.0%). In subjects refractory to lenalidomide (n=23), the ORR was 69.6% (95% CI: 47.1% to 
86.8%); in subjects who were lenalidomide-naïve (n=14), the ORR was 85.7% (95% CI: 57.2% to 98.2%). 
Median PFS and TTP were each 15.4months (95% CI: 9.9 to 34.1 months) in the MPD cohort. The responses 
were rapid, with median TTR of 0.95 months. The responses were durable; median DOR was 22.1 months 
(95% CI: 9.5–38.0) in the MPD group.  
A post-hoc subgroup analyses in the MPD group suggested that less heavily pretreated subjects lacking high-
risk disease features such as poor cytogenetics, ISS Stages II and III, and serum β-2 microglobulin ≥ 2.5 
mg/L did better in terms of ORR, DOR, TTP, and PFS. The subjects who were refractory to lenalidomide 
(n=23) were comparable to bortezomib-refractory subjects (n=13) in terms of ORR (69.6% vs. 69.2% by 
Onyx computational algorithm), but had shorter median DOR (10.8 vs. 22.1months), TTP and PFS (7.9 vs. 
15.4 months). As expected, the subgroup of subjects with no prior lenalidomide exposure (n=14) had the 
best outcome, demonstrating an ORR of 85.7% with median PFS that was not estimable at the time of 
analysis. 
Study PX-171-011 
Study PX-171-011 (N = 315) was an open-label Phase 3 evaluated Kyprolis monotherapy versus low-dose 
corticosteroids with optional cyclophosphamide in subjects with relapsed and refractory myeloma (≥  3 prior 
therapies). A total of 157 subjects were randomized to the carfilzomib monotherapy arm and 158 subjects 
were randomized to the control arm. More than half the subjects (52.1%) were above 65 years of age, and 
15.6% were ≥  75 years of age. The median age of subjects was 63.0 years in the carfilzomib arm as 
compared to 66.0 years in the control arm. The percentage of male subjects was 52.2% in the carfilzomib 
arm and 60.8% in the control arm. 
Overall, the subjects enrolled in this study were heavily pretreated and had received a median of 5 prior 
regimens (range: 3 to 17); 28.3% of subjects had received > 6 prior regimens (28.7% carfilzomib; 27.8% 
control). Subjects had received a median of 8 unique antimyeloma drugs. All subjects (100%) had received 
an alkylator, bortezomib, an IMiD, and a corticosteroid, as required by the protocol, and 75.9% of subjects 
had received an anthracycline. A total of 66.3% of subjects had prior transplant (68.2% carfilzomib; 64.6% 
control). A total of 99.7% (314 of 315) of subjects were refractory to their last prior regimen, with 62.5% of 
subjects refractory to both bortezomib and an IMiD. In any prior regimen, 67.0% of subjects were refractory 
to bortezomib, and in last prior regimen, 24.4% of subjects were refractory to bortezomib. These prior 
treatments were balanced in both study arms. 
The primary endpoint was Overall Survival. The median OS was 10.2 months (95% CI: 8.4 to 14.4 months) 
in the carfilzomib arm, versus 10.0 months (95% CI: 7.7 to 12.0 months) in the control arm (HR =0.975, 
95% CI: 0.760,1.249; p=0.4172). The median OS follow-up was 27.8 months (95% CI: 24.6 to 33.7 
months) and 29.8 months (95% CI: 24.3 to 33.6 months), respectively. 
PX-171-003 – Part 2 (A1) 
PX-171-003 – Part 2 (A1) enrolled subjects with relapsed and refractory myeloma who had received at least 
2 prior therapies and were previously treated with both bortezomib and either of 2 IMiDs (thalidomide or 
lenalidomide). Ptients received carfilzomib monotherapyat 20/27 mg/m2.

Two hundred sixty-six (266) subjects enrolled in the study. The median age was 63.0 years (range: 37.0 to 
87.0 years); both genders were well represented; 71.4%were White, and 19.9% Black subjects.  Subjects 
were heavily pretreated, with a median of 5 prior treatment regimens (range: 1 to 20); 81.6% had received 
≥  4 regimens, and 74.4% had previously received an ASCT. All subjects (100%) had been exposed to an 
IMiD (93.6% had received lenalidomide; 74.8% had received thalidomide), and 99.6% had received 
bortezomib (including 49.6% in their last prior regimen). Of note, 94.7% of subjects had disease refractory 
to their most recent multiple myeloma treatment, with 83.1%, 72.9%, and 44.4% of subjects refractory in 
any prior regimen to lenalidomide, bortezomib and thalidomide, respectively. The primary endpoint was ORR. 
The IRC-assessed ORR on study was 22.9% (95% CI: 18.0% to 28.5%). Response rates were also assessed 
by investigator and Onyx’s computational algorithm: ORR was 22.6% by investigator and 23.3% by Onyx’s 
computational algorithm. The majority of responses were durable (lasting ≥  6 months). Of the responders 
with PR or better, 62.0% of the subjects maintained their response for at least 6 months and 27.1% of the 
subjects maintained their response for over 12 months, per the corresponding Kaplan-Meier estimate of 
event-free rate at each time point. The median DOR was 7.8 months (95% CI: 5.6 to 9.2 months) for the 
responses of PR or better. The median PFS was 3.7 months (95% CI: 2.8 to 4.6 months), and the median 
TTP estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method was 3.9 months (95% CI: 3.0 to 4.8 months). The median OS for 
was 15.4 months (95% CI: 12.4 to 19.2 months); the median OS follow-up was 38.5 months. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The efficacy of Kyprolis was evaluated in a randomised, open-label, multicentre study of 792 patients with 
relapsed multiple myeloma, which evaluated the combination of Kyprolis with lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone versus lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone, randomised 1:1 (SmPC, section 5.1). 
The disease status and other baseline characteristics were well balanced between the two arms, including age 
(64 years, range 31 91 years), gender (56% male), ECOG performance status (48% with performance status 
1), high risk genetic mutations, consisting of the genetic subtypes t(4;14), t(14;16), or deletion 17p in ≥  
60% of plasma cells (13%), unknown risk genetic mutations, which included subjects with results not 
collected or not analysed (47%), and baseline ISS stage III disease (20%). Subjects had received 1 to 3 
prior lines of therapy (median of 2), including prior treatment with bortezomib (66%), thalidomide (44%) and 
lenalidomide (20%) (SmPC, section 5.1). 
Subjects were required to have relapsed or progressed on or after at least 1, but no more than 3, prior 
multiple myeloma therapies. The study did not restrict the types of prior therapies a subject may have 
received (including a prior alkylator and/or transplant), and allowed enrollment of subjects who may have 
received bortezomib (but who did not progress during treatment) and subjects who may have received 
lenalidomide or dexamethasone (but did not progress during the first 3 months of therapy, or at any time on 
therapy if it was the last regimen prior to study entry, or discontinued due to intolerance). Therefore, purely 
refractory to bortezomib and/or lenalidomide were not allowed.  
Overall, baseline characteristics were evenly balanced between groups.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Results from the interim analysis on PFS have shown that patients in the CRd arm had a significantly longer 
PFS than the Rd arm (HR = 0.69 [95% CI: 0.57, 0.83]).  The gain of 8.7 months (26.3 months in the CRd 
Assessment report  
EMA/670306/2015 
Page 86/142 
 
  
  
arm versus 17.6 months in the control group) in PFS is considered clinically significant. The sensitivity 
analyses were overall consistent among different subgroups and confirmed the reliability of the main 
outcome, with HR quite similar among them.  
During the initial evaluation, the CHMP raised a major objection about the indication needing to be further 
discussed, with reference to subjects who have progressed while on bortezomib or Rd therapy who were 
excluded from the pivotal study. For patients “refractory to bortezomib” (they did not progress during 
treatment) in the pivotal study (15% of the whole study population) medians PFS was 22.3 months versus 
19.4 months in CRd and Rd arms respectively (HR 0.799; 95%CI:0.492-1.297). Overall response rate was 
80% and 60.3% in CRd and Rd arms respectively. For patients “refractory to lenalidomide” (they did not 
progress during the first 3 months of therapy, or at any time on therapy if it was the last regimen prior to 
study entry, or discontinued due to intolerance) in the pivotal study (19% of the whole study population) 
medians PFS was 11.3 months versus 9 months in CRd and Rd arms respectively (HR 0.637; 95%CI:0.333-
1.219). ORR was 69% and 25% in CRd and Rd arms respectively. Data in patients double-refractory to 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone in the same regimen were pretty similar to those obtained in the subset of 
“refractory to lenalidomide”. In the light of these results, there could be a proportion of patients within the 
applicant’s definition of refractory disease (nonresponsive to any regimen; progression during any regimen; 
or progression within 60 days of completion of any regimen), who might obtain benefit from treatment with 
the combination of carfilzomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone. Therefore it does not seem reasonable to 
exclude the refractory population from the indication. Section 5.1 of the SmPC reflects that the pivotal study 
did not evaluate the benefit/risk ratio in the broader refractory population. 
The assessment of proportional hazards assumption for treatment over time, revealed the lack of benefit 
beyond the 18 months, which reflects the duration of the treatment. Treatment with Kyprolis combined with 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone for longer than 18 cycles should be based on an individual benefit risk 
assessment, as the data on the tolerability and toxicity of carfilzomib beyond 18 cycles are limited (SmPC, 
section 4.2). 
The main secondary endpoint, OS, did not cross the prespecified early stopping boundary for the interim 
analysis, even though the result points out a clear positive trend in favour of CRd (HR = 0.79 [95% CI: 0.63, 
0.99]; log-rank p = 0.0182) with more deaths in the control arm at the time of the cut-off (143 [36.1%] vs 
162 [40.9%]). The median OS was not reached on either arm and analysis at 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months 
reveal a higher survival rate for KRd subjects at every time point. Notably, the Kaplan-Meier (K-M) event-free 
rate at 24 months was 73.3% (95% CI: 68.6%–77.5%) in the KRd arm and 65.0% (95% CI: 59.9%–69.5%) 
in the Rd arm. The curves are separated from the beginning and during the time. This interim analysis was 
carried out with 60% of final number of events required. Despite the fact that CRd is pointing out a clear 
trend in OS benefit, the data are still immature. The Applicant was recommended to submit the OS mature 
data when available.  
Subgroup analyses of OS do not reveal any unexpected results, considering the limited sample sized of some 
subsets. 
The use of the combination of CRd provided a positive benefit in terms of ORR  (CRd 87.1%; Rd 66.7%; p < 
0.0001), duration of response (CRd 28.6 months; Rd 21.2 months), and QoL. More patients in the CRd arm 
had a Stringent Complete Response (14% vs 3%), CR (18% vs 5%) and VGPR (38% vs 31%). ORR 
determined by investigators and ORCA was consistent with that observed by the IRC. The time to progression 
was also positive for the experimental arm (31.4 months [95% CI: 26.4, NE]) vs (19.4 months [95% CI: 
16.6, 23.2] CRd vs Rd respectively).

In addition, Studies PX-171-006 and PX-171-004 provided supportive evidence of efficacy in the relapsed 
setting, one evaluated the KRd regimen (PX-171-006) and the other evaluated Kyprolis monotherapy (PX-
171-004). Only the Phase 1b KRd dose-finding study PX-171-006, which enrolled a cohort of subjects (N = 
52, maximum planned dose [MPD] cohort) who received the same KRd combination dose as in PX-171-009, 
is to some extend comparable to the pivotal one. These studies enrolled subjects that were more heavily 
pretreated than PX-171-009. A higher proportion of subjects in the 20/27 mg/m2 cohorts in both studies 
were lenalidomide-exposed (70.0–73.1%) or refractory (41.4–44.2%) than in the KRd arm of PX-171-009 
(19.9% lenalidomide-exposed, 71% lenalidomide refractory). Per study design more than 95% of subjects in 
PX-171-004 were bortezomib-naïve compared to 34.2% in PX-171-009. 
Additional clinical experience has been generated with Kyprolis monotherapy in patients with relapsed and 
refractory multiple myeloma. Study PX-171-011 was an open-label randomised phase 3 study (N = 315; 
exposure to ≥  3 prior therapies required). Patients enrolled to study PX 171-011 were more heavily pre-
treated with lower organ and marrow function as compared to those enrolled in study PX 171-009. PX 171-
011 evaluated Kyprolis monotherapy versus a control arm (corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide). The study 
did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint of demonstrating superiority of Kyprolis monotherapy over the 
active control arm in overall survival (HR = 0.975 [95% CI: 0.760-1.249]. PX 171-003A1 was a single-arm 
phase 2 study (N = 266; exposure to ≥  2 prior therapies required), which met its primary efficacy endpoint 
of IRC-assessed ORR (22.9%). Both studies showed that carfilzomib has antitumor activity in last line. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The addition of carfilzomib to Rd resulted in a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in 
the primary endpoint of PFS compared to Rd with a positive trend in overall survival and high response rates 
in adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Data from the 11 completed clinical studies (N = 2123) were pooled and analysed as part of the integrated 
safety database and forms the primary basis for evaluation of carfilzomib safety in this application (Table 39).

In this report a treatment-emergent adverse event ([TEAE] henceforth referred to as an AE) is defined as an 
event that began in the interval between the first dose of study treatment and 30 days after the last dose, or 
a  pre-existing  condition  that  worsened  in  severity  during  study  treatment.  However,  due  to  differences  in 
reporting  criteria  for  grade  changes  of  the  same  AE  term  between  studies  (some  studies  only  required  the 
highest  grade  to  be  reported  while  others  required  all  grade  changes  to  be  reported  separately),  the  most 
conservative  approach  was  taken  for  this  analysis.  All  Grade  2  or  higher  AEs  were  considered  to  be  TEAEs 
even if they had a start date before the treatment start date. 
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were identified using the threshold criteria defined below for subject incidence 
differences between study arms in the 2 randomized clinical studies (PX-171-009 and PX-171-011).  
1.  Any grade AE with a subject incidence ≥ 5% and difference ≥ 2% between study arms

2.  ≥ Grade 3 AEs with a subject incidence ≥ 2% and difference ≥ 1% between study arms  
3.  Serious AEs with a subject incidence ≥ 1% and difference ≥ 1% between study arms  
On-study deaths, defined as death that occurred within 30 days from the last dose of treatment (or deaths 
due to AEs that started within 30 days from last dose). 
Patient exposure 
The median exposure of carfilzomib per administration in PX-171-009 was 26.84 mg/m2 (26.83 mg/m2 in 
pooled CRd safety population), and 26.42 mg/m2 in PX-171-011 (24.00 mg/m2 in pooled monotherapy 
population). The relative dose intensity was high, with a median of > 90%, for all study treatment drugs in 
both Phase 3 studies.  
The median duration of exposure in PX-171-009 was 70.3 weeks, in contrast to 16.3 weeks in PX-171-011 
which enrolled subjects with more advanced disease. 
Primary Analysis Population – Primary CRd Combination Therapy Population 
The Primary CRd Combination Therapy Population comprises subjects who received carfilzomib in 
combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone. All subjects in this group have relapsed multiple 
myeloma and have received from 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy. Information regarding specific study subjects 
that are included in the primary analysis population is as follows: 
o  Carfilzomib 20/27 mg/m2 (N = 444, referred to as the pooled CRd cohort): includes 392 subjects 
from Phase 3 Study PX-171-009 randomized to receive CRd. Additionally, 52 subjects from Cohorts 6 
and 7 of Phase 1b study PX-171-006 are also included, all of whom were to receive the same dose of 
CRd as in PX 171-009. 
- Data from the 392 subjects enrolled in Phase 3 study PX 171-009 (referred to as the CRd arm) were 
also presented separately as well in order to facilitate direct comparison within the randomized study. 
- Carfilzomib less than 20/27 mg/m2 (N = 32): includes subjects from Cohorts 1 to 5 of Phase 1b 
study PX-171-006 who received carfilzomib 15 to 20 mg/m2, lenalidomide 10 mg to 25 mg and 
dexamethasone 40 mg. 
o  Control arm (N = 389, referred to as Rd arm): includes subjects randomized to receive lenalidomide 
and dexamethasone but not carfilzomib in the Phase 3 Study PX-171-009. This data was provided 
separately for comparison and is not part of the pooled analysis. 
The disposition of the subjects who initiated treatment with 20/27 mg/m2 carfilzomib, as of the data cut-off 
date (16 June 2014), is shown in Table 40.

Monotherapy Population 
The Monotherapy Population includes subjects with relapsed and/or refractory myeloma who received 
carfilzomib as a single agent with no other combination antimyeloma drug. Information regarding specific 
study subjects that are included in the Monotherapy Population is as follows: 
o  Carfilzomib monotherapy (all dose levels, N = 788; also referred to as all pooled carfilzomib 
monotherapy cohort): includes 157 subjects enrolled in the Phase 3 Study PX-171-011. The 
remaining 631 subjects are from five Phase 2 studies (PX-171-003 – Part 1 [A0], PX-171-003 – Part 
2 [A1], PX-171-004 [Parts 1 and 2], PX-171-005, and 2011-002). Data from these subjects have 
been integrated and presented together as well as further subdivided by intended dose of carfilzomib 
into the following subpopulations. 
-  Carfilzomib 20/27 mg/m2 (N = 598): includes 157 subjects from the Phase 3 Study PX-171-011 
randomized to receive carfilzomib. Additionally, subjects from the Phase 2 Study PX-171-003 – 
Part 2 (A1), the 20/27 mg/m2 cohort of Phase 2 study PX-171-004 – Part 2, and subjects in 
2011-002) who received carfilzomib monotherapy are also included. 
  Data from the 157 subjects enrolled into Study PX 171-011 (referred to as the carfilzomib 
arm) are further presented separately as well in order to facilitate direct comparison within 
the randomized study. 
o  Carfilzomib less than 20/27 mg/m2 (N = 190): includes subjects from Phase 2 Studies PX-171-003 – 
Part 1 (A0), PX-171-004 – Part 1, and PX-171-005, and the 20 mg/m2 cohort of Phase 2 study PX-
171-004 – Part 2.

In PX-171-005, carfilzomib was escalated from a dose of 15 mg/m2 to 20 mg/m2 (Cycle 2 Day 1) 
and then to 27 mg/m2 (Cycle 3 Day 1). Although a total of 27 of 50 enrolled subjects escalated 
their carfilzomib dose to 27 mg/m2 during the study period, the entire enrolled population of 50 
subjects is considered under the “< 20/27 mg/m2” grouping in this SCS because the Cycle 1 
dosing was 15 mg/m2 for all subjects. Twenty-eight subjects in PX-171-005 who received 
dexamethasone 40 mg/week at varying time points after Cycle 2 are also included; this small 
number is not expected to impact the assessment of safety of this dose level. 
o  Control arm (N = 153): includes subjects randomized to receive corticosteroids with optional 
cyclophosphamide but not carfilzomib in the Phase 3 Study PX-171-011. This data is provided 
separately for comparison and is not part of the pooled analysis. 
Of the 788 subjects in the all pooled carfilzomib monotherapy cohort who initiated treatment with carfilzomib 
(any dose), 0.8% are currently being treated, and 99.2% have discontinued treatment: 51.8% due to PD and 
15.6% due to an AE. In the carfilzomib and control arms in PX-171-011, a total of 74.5% and 65.4%, 
respectively, discontinued treatment due to PD and 14.6% and 20.3% discontinued treatment due to an AE. 
For subjects receiving carfilzomib in the all pooled carfilzomib monotherapy cohort, the median duration of 
carfilzomib treatment was 14.9 weeks (range: 0.1 to 138.4 weeks) with a median of 4 cycles initiated. The 
number of subjects who dose escalated to 27 mg/m2 in the all pooled carfilzomib monotherapy cohort was 
lower than the carfilzomib arm of PX-171-011 (70.2% versus 95.5%, respectively). This difference was 
primarily driven by a different dose escalation schedule in PX-171-011 where subjects escalated to 27 mg/m2 
on C1D8, while in most earlier studies, dose escalation occurred on C2D1. Consequently, in Study PX-171-
003 – Part 2 (A1), which makes up a third of the subjects in the all pooled carfilzomib monotherapy cohort, 
19.2% of subjects discontinued in Cycle 1 prior to escalating to 27 mg/m2. 
In PX-171-011, the median duration of treatment with carfilzomib was 16.29 weeks, with a median of 5.0 
cycles initiated. In the control arm of that study, the median duration of treatment with corticosteroids and 
cyclophosphamide were 10.71 and 10.14 weeks, respectively, with a median number of 3.0 cycles of each 
initiated. The median relative dose intensity of carfilzomib in the all pooled carfilzomib monotherapy cohort 
was 95.2% (100% in the carfilzomib arm of PX-171-011). 
Adverse events  
An overview of AEs in PX-171-009 study and in the pooled CRd arm is presented in Table 42.

Table 39. Summary of Adverse Events In Subjects in the Primary CRd Combination Therapy 
Population (Safety Population) 
In the monotherapy population, AEs were reported in 98.1% of subjects in the carfilzomib arm and in 93.5% 
in control arm (Study PX-171-011). At least 1 AE assessed by the investigator as related to study treatment 
was reported in 61.1% and 49.7% of subjects in the carfilzomib and control arms, respectively. The subject 
incidence rate of AEs having a severity of Grade 3 or higher in the carfilzomib and control arms in PX-171-
011 were 75.2% and 71.2%, respectively. The subject incidence rate of SAEs were higher in the carfilzomib 
arm than in the controlarm in PX-171-011 (58.6% versus 51.0%). Overall, 18.5% of the subjects in the 
carfilzomib arm in PX-171-011 died while on study treatment or within 30 days of their last dose of study 
treatment, compared with 22.2% in the control arm. Since the protocol required all deaths due to PD within 
30 days of last dose to be reported as an AE, this includes 8.9% and 9.2% of subjects in the 2 arms, 
respectively, who died due to PD. Rates of study drug discontinuation due to an AE were lower in the 
carfilzomib arm in PX-171-011 than in the control arm (14.6% versus 20.3%). 
A summary of the Common Adverse Events occurred in the Primary CRd Combination Therapy Population is

Within the monotherapy population (Study PX-171-011), the 3 most frequently reported AEs in both study 
arms were anaemia (88% and 75% in the carfilzomib and control arm, respectively), thrombocytopenia 
(59% and 46%, respectively), and pyrexia (44% and 30%, respectively). Adverse events observed in more 
subjects in the carfilzomib arm than the control arm (≥ 5% difference) include anaemia, thrombocytopenia, 
pyrexia, nausea (32% vs 14%), hypertension (23% vs 9%), dyspnoea (23% vs 13%), cough (19% vs 10%), 
headache (17% vs 6%), URTI (16% vs 3%), acute renal failure (16% vs 6%), vomiting (15% vs 5%), and 
dizziness (11% vs 3%). Conversely, insomnia (4% vs 18%), constipation (10% vs 20%), and pneumonia 
(12% vs 20%) were observed in more control arm subjects than carfilzomib arm subjects (≥ 5% difference).

AEs of special interest 
Cardiac Adverse Events: Cardiac failure 
Cardiac failure AEs were increased in CRd subjects (6.4% all grades, 3.8% ≥ Grade 3) compared to the Rd 
control arm in PX-171-009 (4.1% all grades, 1.8% ≥ Grade 3) and 0.5% of subjects in the CRd arm 
discontinued treatment as a result. Cardiac failure events resolved in more than 60% of the subjects in the 
CRd arm. Cardiac failure typically occurred early in the course of Carfilzomib therapy and therefore, is less 
likely to be due to cumulative toxicity: median onset was Cycles 3/4 in CRd subjects versus Cycles 9/10 in Rd 
control subjects. In PX-171-011, increase in cardiac failure AEs was also noted in the carfilzomib 
monotherapy arm (7.6% all grades, 5.7% ≥ Grade 3) compared to control (4.6% all grades, 3.3% ≥ Grade 
3).  
Overall, the median age of carfilzomib-treated subjects that experienced an AE of cardiac failure across 
studies was generally higher than the respective overall study population, and it was generally higher in the 
carfilzomib-treated subjects in both populations experiencing an AE of cardiac failure than the respective 
control arms, with a higher proportion of subjects being ≥ 75 years of age.  
There were 4 (1%) subjects with Grade 5 cardiac failure events in each arm of PX-171-009. 
Cardiac Adverse Events: Myocardial infarction 
Myocardial Infarction AEs were reported in 3.4% (2.5% ≥ Grade 3) of subjects in the pooled CRd cohort and 
3.6%(2.6% ≥ Grade 3) of subjects in the CRd arm of PX-171-009, respectively, compared to 1.3% (1.0% ≥ 
Grade 3) of subjects in the Rd arm of PX-171-009. Myocardial infarction and acute myocardial infarction were 
the most frequently reported AEs in the pooled CRd cohort, and CRd and Rd arms of PX-171-009. Serious 
AEs of myocardial infarction were reported at a subject incidence rate of 2.5% and 2.6% in the pooled CRd 
cohort and CRd arm of PX-171-009, respectively, compared to 1% in the Rd arm. There were three Grade 5 
AEs of myocardial infarction in the CRd arm of PX-171-009. The Rd arm of PX-171-009 also had two Grade 5 
AEs, 1 case of myocardial infarction and 1 case of acute coronary syndrome. Discontinuations due to these 
events were ≤ 1.3% in CRd subjects and the events resolved in most subjects. The median onset of 
myocardial infarction and myocardial ischemia was Cycle 5 in the CRd arm of PX-171-009 and approximately 
1 cycle later in the Rd arm. 
Cardiac Adverse Events: Ischemic Heart Disease 
The subject incidence rates (all grades and ≥Grade 3 AEs) of Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) AEs were 5.6% 
(3.4% ≥ Grade 3) and 5.9% (3.3% ≥ Grade 3) in the pooled CRd cohort and CRd arm of PX-171-009 
respectively, compared to 4.6%(2.1%≥ Grade 3) in the Rd arm. For the 32 subjects in the Phase 1/2 dose-
escalation study PX-171-006 who received < 20/27 mg/m2 of carfilzomib, there were no reports of an IHD 
AE. Six (1.4%) subjects and 5 (1.3%) subjects discontinued any study treatment in the pooled CRd cohort 
and CRd arm of PX-171-009, respectively, compared to 2 subjects (0.5%) in the Rd arm due to an AE of IHD. 
Dose reduction was reported at a subject incidence rate of ≤ 0.5% in any cohort. The median time from first 
dosing date to first SMQB_IHD AE was 140 days in the pooled CRd cohort and CRd arm of PX-171-009 
compared to 164 days in the Rd arm. 
Cardiac Adverse Events: Cardiac Arrhythmias 
The subject incidence rates of cardiac arrhythmias AEs were 17.3% (5.0% ≥ Grade 3) and 16.6% (5.4% ≥ 
Grade 3) in the pooled CRd cohort and CRd arm of PX-171-009, respectively, compared to 15.2% (5.1% 
≥Grade 3) in the Rd arm of PX-171-009. The subject incidence rates of treatment discontinuation were 
Assessment report  
EMA/670306/2015 
Page 103/142 
 
  
  
comparable between the pooled CRd cohort and the study arms of PX-171-009 and were < 1% in both the 
CRd cohorts. All events for 54 out of the 76 (71.1%) subjects in the pooled CRd cohort who had Cardiac 
arrhythmia events were reported as resolved by the investigator. Serious AEs of cardiac arrhythmia were 
reported in 4.3% and 4.6% of subjects in the pooled CRd cohort and CRd arm of PX-171-009, respectively, 
compared to 3.1% in the Rd arm. There were three Grade 5 AEs in the CRd arm of PX-171-009 (2 cases of 
cardiac arrest and 1 sudden death). Two Grade 5 AEs were also noted in the Rd arm of PX-171-009 and 
included 1 sudden death and 1 arrhythmia (non-specified). 
No imbalance between the pooled CRd cohort and study arms of PX-171-009 in the Torsade de pointes_QT 
prolongation was observed.  
Vascular Events 
The subject incidence rates of grouped venous embolic and thrombotic events (VTE) were 15.3% (5.6% ≥ 
Grade 3) in the CRd arm of PX-171-009, compared to 9.0% (3.9% ≥ Grade 3) in the Rd arm. This included 
AEs of thrombophlebitis (2.0% in CRd arm, 0.8% in Rd arm) and superficial thrombophlebitis (2.8% in CRd 
arm, 1.5% in Rd arm), which were more likely to occur in subjects on receiving CRd due to the IV route of 
administration of carfilzomib. The subject incidence rate of treatment discontinuations/dose reductions due to 
AEs of Venous Embolic and Thrombotic Events (VTE) were 1.0%/2.3% in the CRd arm of PX-171-009, 
compared to 1.3%/1.3% in the Rd arm. Thrombotic prophylaxis was required in both study PX-171-009 and 
PX-171-006.  
Subject incidence rates for Hypertension in which the PT of hypertension were reported at 15.8% (5.6% ≥ 
Grade 3) in the CRd arm of PX-171-009, compared to 8.2% (2.1% ≥Grade 3) in the Rd arm. Less than 1% of 
subjects in any treatment cohort dose-reduced or discontinued treatment as a result. Approximately 49% of 
subjects both in the pooled CRd cohort and CRd arm of PX-171-009 had a medical history of hypertension, 
compared to 44.2% in the Rd arm. 
Pulmonary Events 
Incidence rates of grouped dyspnoea AEs (HLT) were 25.2% (2.9% ≥ Grade 3) and 22.7% (3.1% ≥ Grade 3) 
in the pooled CRd cohort and CRd arm of PX-171-009, respectively, compared to 18.0% (2.1% ≥ Grade 3) in 
the Rd arm of PX-171-009. No carfilzomib-treated subject discontinued treatment while dose reduction was 
required in1.4% and 1.3% of subjects in the pooled CRd cohort and CRd arm of PX-171-009, respectively. 
Dyspnoea was the most frequently reported AE in this grouping in the pooled CRd cohort (21.6% [2.5% ≥ 
Grade 3]), and CRd (19.6% [2.8% ≥ Grade 3]) and Rd (14.9% [1.8% ≥ Grade 3]) arms of PX-171-009. 
Serious AEs were reported in< 1.5% of subjects in all treatment cohorts. Median time to onset of the first 
episode of a dyspnoea AE was earlier in the carfilzomib treated subjects (study treatment days 44 and 58 in 
the pooled CRd and CRd arm of PX-171-009, respectively) compared to study treatment day 84 in the Rd 
arm. An analysis of clinically related concomitant AEs was performed to evaluate whether dyspnoea was part 
of a broader symptomatology or indicative of a more serious condition.Productive cough was ≥Grade 3 in1 
CRd-treated subject (in PX-171-009) and 1 CRd-treated subject discontinued treatment due to cough. Cough 
was reported as resolved or resolved with sequelae in a majority of subjects with 4.7% and 4.3% of subjects 
in the pooled CRd cohort and the CRd arm of PX-171-009, respectively, reporting cough as “not resolved”. 
More than 70% of subjects with an AE of cough also reported an AE of URTI in the all pooled CRd cohort as 
well as the CRd and Rd arms of PX-171-009. Where an AE ofcough was reported, a subject incidence rate of 
47.8% and 52.2% of lower respiratory tract infection was also reported in the pooled CRd cohort and CRd 
arm of PX-171-009.

Acute Renal Failure 
Subject incidence rates of acute renal failure AEs including ≥ Grade 3 AEs were 8.4% (all grades) and  3.3% 
(≥ Grade 3) in CRd arm, and 7.2% (all grades) and 3.1% (≥ Grade 3) in the Rd arms of PX-171-009, with 
<1% of subjects discontinuing treatment as a result. Dialysis was performed in 2 subjects in the CRd arm of 
PX-171-009 while no subject in the Rd arm required dialysis. The subject incidence rates of acute renal 
failure AEs were reported at 17.9% (4.6% ≥ Grade 3) in the CRd arm of PX-171-009, compared to 13.1% 
(3.9% ≥Grade 3) in the Rd arm. The corresponding rates of AEs leading to treatment discontinuation (≤ 
1%), requiring dose reduction (≤ 6%), and SAEs (≤ 2%) were comparable among the cohorts/arms. The 
incidence rates of dose reduction were 2.0% in the CRd arm of PX-171-009, compared to 1.8% in the Rd 
arm. Subjects with lower baseline CrCL in both populations were more likely to experience a renal AE. There 
were no Grade 5 AEs in the CRd arm of PX-171-009 and one Grade 5 AE of acute renal failure in the Rd arm. 
In Study PX-171-011, the overall incidence of adverse events of acute renal failure was higher in the 
carfilzomib monotherapy arm (24.8%) compared with control (9.2%). The high incidence of adverse events 
of acute renal failure in Study PX-171-011 may be attributable to the subject population being a more heavily 
pretreated subject population. Therefore, Study PX-171-011 was the only study with elevated relative risk for 
acute renal failure for low baseline CrCL. 
Hepatic Events: Hepatic Toxicity and Hepatic Failure 
The subject incidence rate of AEs in this category (Hepatic failure, fibrosis and cirrhosis and other liver 
damage related conditions) were 2.0% (0.5% ≥Grade 3) in the CRd arm of PX-171-009, compared to 0.5% 
(0.3% ≥Grade 3) in the Rd arm. The subject incidence rates of individual AEs under this grouping occurred in 
< 1% of subjects in any cohort/study arm. One of these subjects also met the biochemical criteria for Hy’s 
law. One subject dose-reduced and 1 subject discontinued treatment in each treatment arm of PX-171-009 
as a result. 
There were 2 subjects with SAEs, both in the CRd arm of PX-171-009: 1 subject with an SAE of 
hypoalbuminemia and 1 with an SAE of increased ALT. No carfilzomib-treated subject discontinued any study 
treatment due to an AE of Liver related investigations, signs, and symptoms. 
Gastrointestinal Events 
Gastrointestinal disorders were reported in 66.3% of subjects in the CRd arm of PX-171-009, compared to 
56.6% of subjects in the Rd arm. Diarrhoea, nausea, constipation, and vomiting were the most frequently 
reported AEs of any grade in this category. Of these, diarrhoea and nausea were reported at a subject 
incidence rate that was ≥ 5% higher in the CRd-treated subjects (pooled CRd cohort and CRd arm of PX-171-
009) compared to the Rd arm. Most GI AEs were low-grade and non-serious events. Grade 3 and higher 
diarrhoea AEs were reported in 3.8% (1.4% SAEs) of subjects in the CRd arm of PX-171-009, compared to 
4.1% (2.3% SAEs) of subjects in the Rd arm. Diarrhoea led to dose reduction of any study drug in 2.6% of 
subjects in the CRd arm of PX-171-009, compared to 3.6% of subjects in the Rd arm. 
In subjects who reported diarrhoea as resolved or resolved with sequelae, the median duration of the longest 
episode of diarrhoea was 10 days in the pooled CRd cohort and CRd arm of PX-171-009, compared to 9 days 
in the Rd arm. The median number of episodes was 1 and 2, respectively, in the pooled CRd cohort and the 
CRd arm of PX-171-009, and 1 in the Rd arm. Antidiarrheal agents as concomitant medications were reported 
in 23% and 22.4% of subjects in the pooled CRd cohort and the CRd arm of PX-171-009, respectively, 
compared to 18.3% of subjects in the Rd arm.

Vomiting was reported as resolved or resolved with sequelae in 52 of 59 subjects and 41 of 47 subjects in the 
pooled CRd cohort and the CRd arm of PX-171-009, respectively, compared to 30 of 32 subjects in the Rd 
arm. In subjects who reported vomiting as resolved or resolved with sequelae, the median duration of the 
longest episode was 1 day in the pooled CRd cohort and CRd arm of PX-171-009 compared to 3 days in the 
control arm. The median number of episodes was 1 in all cohorts. Antiemetics and antinauseants were 
reported as concomitant medications in 16.9% and 13% of subjects in the pooled CRd cohort and the CRd 
arm of PX-171-009, respectively, compared to 5.9% of subjects in the Rd arm.  
Hematologic Events: Anaemia 
Subject incidence rates of grouped anaemia AEs of all grades were 44.6% (18.4% ≥ Grade 3) in the CRd arm 
of PX-171-009, compared to 40.4% (18.0% ≥ Grade 3) in the Rd arm. There were no treatment 
discontinuations in CRd arm of PX-171-009, while 4 (1.0%) subjects in the Rd arm discontinued treatment. 
Four (1.0%) subjects in the CRd arm of PX-171-009, required dose reductions compared to 8 (2.1%) 
subjects in the Rd arm of PX-171-009.  
Hematologic Events: Leukopenia 
Subject incidence rates of grouped leukopenia AEs were 45.7% (34.9% ≥Grade 3) in the CRd arm of PX-171-
009, compared to and 40.4% (30.6% ≥Grade 3) in the Rd arm. Treatment discontinuations were 1.3% in the 
CRd arm of PX-171-009, compared to 0.8% in the Rd arm. The subject incidence rates for dose reductions 
were 14.8% in the CRd arm (14.8%) of PX-171-009, compared to the 9.8% in the Rd arm. Grade 4 
neutropenia was noted in 31 subjects in the pooled CRd cohort, of whom 6 subjects, all enrolled in PX-171-
009, also experienced an AE of sepsis compared to 4 of 31 subjects in the Rd arm. 
The subject incidence rates of SAEs for Haematopoietic leukopenia were comparable across all cohorts (2.8% 
and 2.6% in the CRd and Rd arms of PX-171-009, respectively). Febrile neutropenia was the most frequent 
SAE in this grouping being reported in 2.0% of subjects in the PX-171-009 CRd arm compared to 1% in the 
Rd arm. None of these were Grade 5 AEs.  
Hematologic Events: Thrombocytopenia 
Subject incidence rates of thrombocytopenia were 32.4% (19.9% ≥ Grade 3) in the CRd arm of PX-171-009, 
compared to 25.2% (14.4% ≥Grade 3) in the Rd arm. While the subject incidence rates for dose reduction 
were 9.2% in the CRd arm of PX-171-009, the incidence rate of discontinuation from treatment was < 2%. 
Thrombocytopenia was the most frequently reported AE and occurred at a subject incidence rate of 29.3% 
(16.8% ≥ Grade 3) in CRd arm of PX-171-009, compared to 22.9% (12.3% ≥ Grade 3) in the Rd arm. Grade 
4 was noted in 14 subjects (34.1%). Twelve of 38 subjects (31.6%) in the CRd arm of PX-171-009 compared 
to 6 of 23 subjects (26.1%) in the Rd arm who had Grade 4 thrombocytopenia also experienced a bleeding 
event on study. Serious AEs of Thrombocytopenia were reported at subject incidence rates of 1.5% in the 
CRd arm of PX-171-009, compared to 0.8% in the Rd arm. Less than 2% of the CRd and carfilzomib treated 
subjects dose reduced or discontinued carfilzomib as a consequence of thrombocytopenia.  
Subject incidence rates of haemorrhage were 17.3% (1.3% ≥ Grade 3) in the CRd arm of PX-171-009, 
compared to 15.9% (2.3% ≥ Grade 3) in the Rd arm. Less than 1% of subjects either reduced the dose or 
discontinued treatment in any cohort. Epistaxis, contusion, and ecchymosis were the 3 most frequently 
reported AEs in the pooled CRd cohort, and CRd and Rd arms of PX-171-009. Serious AEs of Haemorrhage 
terms were reported at subject incidence rates of 1.0% in the CRd arm of PX-171-009, compared to 1.0% in 
the Rd arm. There were a total of three Grade 5 AEs of haemorrhage, all of which occurred in PX-171-009.

Two of these subjects were enrolled in the CRd arm and died due to subdural hematoma and intracranial 
haemorrhage while the third subject was enrolled in the Rd arm and died due to a cerebral haemorrhage. 
Peripheral Neuropathy Adverse Events 
Peripheral neuropathy AEs were 29.3% (4.3% ≥ Grade 3) in the CRd arm of PX-171-009, compared to 
27.5% (5.4% ≥ Grade 3) in the Rd arm. The subject incidence rates of dose reduction were similar among 
cohorts/arms occurring in 6.6% CRd arm, and 6.2% Rd arm. Less than 1% of peripheral neuropathy AEs 
were reported as SAEs in any treatment cohort and similarly, ≤ 1% subjects discontinued treatment as a 
consequence of a peripheral neuropathy AE. Grade 3 and higher AEs and SAEs were infrequent across all 
carfilzomib-treated subjects and were mostly reported in subjects with baseline peripheral neuropathy. Dose 
reduction and discontinuation of treatment was also infrequent in all treatment cohorts.  
Infections: Respiratory Tract Infections 
The subject incidence rates for grouped URTIs (Upper Respiratory Tract Infections NEC) were 49.0% (3.1% ≥ 
Grade 3) in the CRd arm of PX-171-009, compared to 38.3% (1.8% ≥ Grade 3) in the Rd arm of PX-171-
009. Less than 1% of subjects discontinued treatment in either the pooled CRd cohort or the CRd arm of PX-
171-009. Serious AEs of Upper Respiratory Tract Infections NEC were reported at subject incidence rates of 
2.3% in the CRd arm of PX-171-009, compared to 0.8% of in the Rd arm.  
The incidence rate of grouped lower respiratory tract infections were 38.8% (17.3% ≥ Grade 3) in the CRd 
arm of PX-171-009, compared to 29.6% (14.1% ≥ Grade 3) in the Rd arm. The subject incidence rates of 
treatment discontinuation/dose reduction were 1.5%/3.1% in the CRd arm of PX-171-009, compared to 
1.0%/2.6% in the Rd arm. Bronchitis and pneumonia were the 2 most frequently reported AEs in the CRd 
and Rd arms of PX-171-009. 
Serious AEs in the category of Lower Respiratory Tract Infections NEC were reported at a subject incidence 
rate of 18.4% in the CRd arm of PX-171-009, compared to 14.1% in the Rd arm. Serious AEs of bronchitis 
were reported at an incidence rate of 2% for both the pooled CRd cohort and CRd arm of PX-171-009, and 
1.5% in the Rd arm. Serious AEs of pneumonia were reported at an incidence rate of 14.3% in the CRd arm 
of PX-171-009, compared to 11.1% in the Rd arm. There were two Grade 5 AEs of pneumonia in each arm of 
PX-171-009.  
Ciprofloxacin or other appropriate prophylactic antibacterial agent was recommended during Cycle 1 in all 
subjects receiving carfilzomib in the two Phase 3 studies as well, as in PX-171-006. 
Infections: Urinary Tract Infections 
Urinary tract infection (PT) was reported in 8.7% (1.0% ≥ Grade 3) of subjects in the CRd arm of PX-171-
009 compared to 5.4% (0.3% ≥Grade 3) of subjects in the Rd arm. No subject in any of these 2 groups 
discontinued treatment as a result. Three subjects (0.7%) in the CRd arm of PX-171-009 compared to 2 
subjects (0.5%) in the Rd arm experienced SAEs of urinary tract infection. 
Infections: Herpes Virus Infections 
Subject incidence rates of Herpes virus infections were 3.3% (0% ≥ Grade 3) in the CRd arm of PX-171-009, 
compared to 4.9% (0.3% ≥ Grade 3) in the Rd arm. No subject in the CRd arm of PX-171-009 required dose 
reduction or treatment discontinuation for this AE. The most frequently reported AE under this grouping was 
oral herpes and occurred at a subject incidence rate of 1.5% and 1.3% in the CRd and Rd arms of PX-171-
009, respectively. No ≥ Grade 3 AEs or SAEs were observed in any cohort/study arm, except for one Grade 5 
AE of disseminated herpes zoster in the Rd arm of PX-171-009. 
Assessment report  
EMA/670306/2015

Antiviral therapy in the form of acyclovir or a comparable agent was recommended in most clinical trials of 
carfilzomib (including PX-171-009).  
Infections: Opportunistic Infections 
Opportunistic fungal infection AEs such as candidiasis and aspergillosis were reported with a low subject 
incidence (< 2% for all individual PTs) and differed by < 2% between the CRd-treated subjects (pooled CRd 
and CRd arm of PX-171-009) and the Rd arm. Cytomegalovirus infection was reported in 3 subjects in the 
pooled CRd cohort(2 subjects in the CRd arm of PX-171-009) while no subject in the Rd arm experienced that 
infection. 
The incidence rates were generally higher (across all cohorts) in the Primary CRd Combination Therapy 
population (range: 38.3% to 49.0%) compared to Monotherapy (range: 11.1% to 28.4%).  
Grouped lower respiratory tract infections were also consistently higher in all cohorts in the Primary CRd 
Combination Therapy Population(range: 29.6% to 38.8%) compared to the Monotherapy Population (range: 
16.2% to26.1%). The notable difference was that the subject incidence of grouped lower respiratory tract 
infections, notably pneumonia in the control arm of PX-171-011 was higher (≥ 5% difference) than the 
carfilzomib arm of that study, as well as the all pooled carfilzomib monotherapy cohort. No significant 
differences between the 2 populations were reported for other categories of infections.  
Tumour Lysis Syndrome Adverse Events 
Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) had been observed in some carfilzomib-treated subjects with multiple myeloma 
in early studies (ie, PX-171-003 and PX-171-004). Therefore, TLS prophylaxis measures were instituted in all 
ongoing and subsequent carfilzomib studies as of March 2008, which was accompanied by a decreased 
incidence of TLS events (0.5%). Therefore, TLS prophylaxis measures were instituted included mandatory IV 
hydration before and after carfilzomib dosing in Cycle 1 and optional IV hydration in Cycles 2 and beyond, as 
well as the optional use of allopurinol in subjects at high risk for TLS.  
In the Primary CRd Combination Therapy Population subject incidence rates of TLS were 26.1% and 26.3% in 
the pooled CRd cohort and the CRd arm of PX-171-009, respectively, compared to 17.0% in the Rd arm. 
However, most of these events were AEs of electrolyte abnormalities with hypocalcaemia and hyperuricaemia 
being the 2 most frequent PTs accounting for 15.8% and 5.2% of AEs in the pooled CRd cohort. No subjects 
had a fatal event of TLS during a clinical study. 
In the Monotherapy Population, the subject incidence rate of TLS was 32.0% and 32.5% in the all pooled 
monotherapy cohort and the carfilzomib arm of PX-171-011, respectively, compared to 18.3% in the control 
arm.  
Infusion Reactions 
In carfilzomib trials, 42.3%–56.2% of subjects experienced one or more symptoms (pyrexia, dyspnoea, 
asthenia, vomiting, arthralgia, and/or chills) within a day of carfilzomib dosing that have been defined as 
infusion reactions. These symptoms were predominantly low grade and non-serious with infrequent reports of 
more clinically important events within a day of dosing such as angina pectoris (0.5%-1.2%) and syncope 
(0.3%–0.9%) across the studies. These events were not specifically associated with the first dose of 
carfilzomib (approximately 10% reported any event within a day of the first dose of carfilzomib) and equally 
likely to occur within 1 day of any carfilzomib dosing. There were no differences in types or frequencies of 
AEs between the CRd subjects who received much higher doses of dexamethasone than the monotherapy 
subjects who received 4 mg of dexamethasone premedication.  
Assessment report  
EMA/670306/2015 
Page 108/142 
 
  
  
The subject incidence rate of AEs within 1 day of carfilzomib dosing for any dose in the infusion reaction 
grouping was 45.3% and 42.3% in the pooled CRd cohort and CRd arm of PX-171-009, respectively with, 
7.9% and 7.4% occurred within1 day of the first dose in these 2 cohorts, respectively. Most of these events 
were low grade (Grades 1 and 2) and non-serious. Events that were ≥ Grade 3 were reported at a subject 
incidence rate of 3.4% and 3.6% in the pooled CRd cohort and CRd arm ofPX-171-009, respectively. Serious 
AEs were reported at a subject incidence rate of 2.9% and 3.3% SAEs in the pooled CRd cohort and CRd arm 
of PX-171-009, respectively. None were Grade 5 events. Two (0.5%) subjects in the CRd arm ofPX-171-009 
and 3 (0.7%) subjects in the pooled CRd cohort discontinued treatment as a result of an AE in this grouping. 
One subject each in the CRd arm of PX-171-009 experienced AEs of anaphylactic reaction (Grade 1), cytokine 
release syndrome (Grade 3, considered treatment-related by the investigator) and systemic inflammatory 
response syndrome (Grade 3).  
Comparing across the Primary CRd Combination Therapy and Monotherapy Populations, the rates and types 
of all grade and ≥ Grade 3 AEs typically associated with infusion reactions reported within 1 day of any dose 
of carfilzomib were comparable across the various treatment cohorts. The rates of these AEs in the all pooled 
carfilzomib monotherapy cohort were higher (≥ 5% higher) than the carfilzomib arm ofPX-171-011 as well as 
the Primary CRd population.  
Second Primary Malignancies 
Second primary malignancies were reported at a subject incidence rate of 3.8% (1.8% ≥ Grade 3) and 4.1% 
(1.8% ≥ Grade 3) in the pooled CRd cohort and CRd arm of PX-171-009, respectively, compared to 3.1 %( 
1.8% ≥ Grade 3) in the Rd arm of PX-171-009. A review of the Neoplasms, Benign, Malignant and 
Unspecified SOC identified a subject with an AE of GI stromal tumour in the Rd arm that is not part of the 
grouped term analysis. Myelodysplastic syndrome was reported in 1 subject (Grade 3) in the pooled CRd 
cohort (in Study PX-171-009) compared to 4 subjects (1.0%) in the Rd arm; 2 of the 4 subjects had a Grade 
5 AE of MDS in the RD arm. Based on that review, the subject incidence of invasive SPMs was 2.8% and 
3.3% in the CRd and Rd arms ofPX-171-009, respectively with four Grade 5 AEs (1.0%) in either arm. Non-
invasive SPMs were reported in 1.5% of subjects in either treatment arm and included PTs of basal cell 
carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. 
Hypertension including hypertensive crises 
Hypertensive crises (hypertensive urgency or hypertensive emergency) have occurred following 
administration of Kyprolis. Some of these events have been fatal. In clinical studies, hypertension adverse 
events occurred in approximately 20% of subjects and approximately 30% of these events were grade ≥ 3, 
but hypertensive crises occurred in < 0.5% of subjects. The incidence of hypertension adverse events was 
similar between those with or without a prior medical history of hypertension.  
Posterior  Reversible  Encephalopathy  Syndrome  and  Thrombotic  Thrombocytopenic  Purpura/Haemolytic 
Uremic Syndrome 
Three cases of PRES were identified in subjects receiving carfilzomib. The time to onset of the event of PRES 
for these 3 cases, were 37 day and 13 day in Cd arm and in the second cycle in CRd arm (since the first dose 
of carfilzomib). 
Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura/Haemolytic Uremic Syndrome 
TTP/HUS and Thrombotic Microangiopathy: 7 cases of TTP/HUS and 4 cases of thrombotic microangiopathy 
were identified in subjects receiving Carfilzomib. Eight of the 11 subjects were receiving doses of carfilzomib

above the dose proposed for commercial use in this application and 2 subjects were receiving carfilzomib in 
combination with other antimyeloma drugs (panobinostat or thalidomide and dexamethasone). The events 
typically resolved with discontinuation and/or plasma exchange. Two subjects had a fatal outcome, both in 
the setting of significant comorbidities and complicated hospital admissions (including sepsis in one subject).

006 and PX-171-009. 
b.  Only one death due to an AE was reported in PX-171-006. One subject died in their sleep on Study Treatment Day 3, one 
day after the last dose of carfilzomib with underlying disease noted as a secondary cause of death. 
c.  Subjects who died ≤ 30 days after last dose of carfilzomib are a subset of subject who died ≤ 30 days after last dose of any 
drug. 
“  Other  AEs”  in  the  Pooled  CRd  subjects  include  deaths  from  AEs  of  ‘death’  (3),  acute  respiratory  distress  syndrome  (2), 
subdural hematoma (1), intracranial hemorrhage (1), multiorgan failure (1), sudden death (1), and suicide (1). “Other AEs” in 
the  Rd  arm  of  PX-171-009  include  ‘death’  (2),  myelodysplastic  syndrome  (2),  multiorgan  failure  (1),  sudden  death  (1), 
pulmonary embolism (1), respiratory failure (1), coma (1) and disease progression (1). 
Adverse events of infection were the most common cause of on-study deaths in PX-171-009 (9 subjects in 
CRd arm, 10 subjects in Rd arm), included 8 deaths due to sepsis/septic shock (4 subjects in each arm), and 
7 deaths due to pneumonia/bronchopneumonia (3 subjects in CRd arm, 4 subjects in Rd arm). In the 
remaining 4 subjects, the primary causes of death were URTI and endocarditis in the CRd arm and urosepsis 
and hepatic infection in the Rd arm.  
Cardiovascular AEs were reported as the primary cause of death in 10 subjects in the CRd arm and 7 subjects 
in the Rd arm. These included 5 deaths due to ischemic heart disease (3 subjects in CRd arm, 2 subjects in 
Rd arm), 7 deaths due to cardiac failure (3 subjects in CRd arm, 4 subjects Rd arm), 2 deaths due to cardiac 
arrest (both on CRd arm) and 1 death each due to circulatory collapse, left ventricular dysfunction (both on 
CRd arm), and arrhythmia (Rd arm). Of the 10 deaths due to cardiovascular AEs in the CRd arm, subjects 
had been receiving study treatment for varying lengths of time ranging from 4 days to 453 days. Nine of the 
10 occurred within 30 days of the last dose of carfilzomib. The death due to circulatory collapse in the CRd 
arm occurred more than 30 days after the last dose of carfilzomib but within 30 days of the last dose of 
lenalidomide and/or dexamethasone. Deaths in 12 subjects in the CRd arm and 7 subjects in the Rd arm 
were adjudicated as cardiac deaths. Six and 5 deaths, respectively, in the CRd and Rd arm were adjudicated 
as sudden cardiac deaths, fatal acute coronary syndrome was the adjudicated cause of death in 3 and 1 
subjects in the CRd and Rd arm, respectively, while 2 deaths in the CRd arm and 1 in the Rd arm were 
adjudicated as cardiac failure deaths. One subject in the CRd arm was adjudicated as “other” cardiac death. 
No deaths were considered by the investigator to be related specifically to carfilzomib alone. Two of the 
deaths in the CRd arm were considered by the investigator to be related to both carfilzomib and lenalidomide. 
Eight of the deaths (events of septic shock, sepsis, hepatic infection, respiratory failure, pulmonary

Thrombocytopenia. 
Grade 3 or 4 decreased platelet count was experienced by 226 (28.7%) subjects in the all pooled carfilzomib 
monotherapy cohort, and 59 (37.6%) subjects in the carfilzomib and 48 (31.4%) subjects in the control arms 
of PX-171-011. Of these subjects, 189 in the all pooled carfilzomib monotherapy cohort, 44 in the carfilzomib 
arm, and 32 in the control arm reported an AE of SMQB Thrombocytopenia.

control arms of PX-171-011. Of these subjects, 67 in the all pooled carfilzomib monotherapy cohort, 17 in the 
carfilzomib arm, and 23 in the control arm reported an AE of SMQB Hematopoietic leukopenia. 
Hepatic Tests 
Grade 3 or 4 increased transaminases (ALT or AST) were experienced by 28 (6.3%) of subjects in the pooled 
CRd cohort including 24 subjects (6.1%) in the CRd arm, and 11 (2.8%) subjects in the Rd arm of PX-171-
009. Grade 3 or 4 increased total bilirubin was experienced by 22 (5.0%) subjects in the pooled CRd cohort, 
including 21 (5.4%) in the CRd arm of PX-171-009, and 7 (1.8%) subjects in the Rd arm.  
Grade 3 or 4 increased transaminases were experienced by 41 (5.2%) subjects in the all pooled monotherapy 
cohort, including 8 subjects in the carfilzomib arm of PX-171-011. Grade 3 or 4 increased total bilirubin was 
experienced by 11 (1.4%) subjects in the all pooled monotherapy cohort including 4 (2.5%) in the 
carfilzomib arm.  
The subject incidence rates for AEs occurring under this category were 13.7% (5.2% ≥ Grade 3) and 12.8% 
(4.8% ≥ Grade 3) in the pooled CRd cohort and CRd arm of PX-171-009, respectively, compared to 8.2% 
(1.3% ≥ Grade 3) in the Rd arm of PX-171-009. No subjects in the pooled CRd cohort or CRd arm 
discontinued treatment due to AEs in this grouping and1 subject in the Rd discontinued treatment. The 
subject incidence rate of dose reductions were comparable between the pooled CRd cohort (1.6%) and CRd 
arm(1.5%) of PX-171-009, compared to 0.5% in the Rd arm. Increased ALT/AST, hyperbilirubinemia, and 
increased blood bilirubin, were the most frequently reported AEs in pooled CRd cohort, and CRd and Rd arms 
of PX-171-009.The AEs can be minimized by monitoring of liver chemistries while on treatment. 
Renal Tests 
Grade 3 or 4 increases in serum creatinine were reported in 20 (4.5%) subjects in the pooled CRd cohort, of 
which 18 (4.6%) subjects were enrolled in the CRd arm ofPX-171-009, and 14 (3.6%) in the Rd arm of PX-
171-009.  
Grade 3 or 4 increases in serum creatinine were reported in 56 (7.1%) subjects in the all pooled 
monotherapy cohort, of which 23 (14.6%) subjects were enrolled in the carfilzomib arm of PX-171-011, and 
10 (6.5%) subjects in the control arm ofPX-171-011.  
ECGs 
Vital signs and electrocardiograms (ECGs) were collected in clinical trials, including a triplicate centrally read 
QTc-PK analysis in Phase 1 trials. Early Phase 1 trials also collected pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and 
echocardiograms (ECHOs), which are summarized.  
Per study protocol in PX-171-009, single ECGs were collected at baseline, every 3 cycles while on study 
treatment and at end of treatment in order to assess general cardiac status and not specifically to assess QT 
intervals. A total of 60.8% and 63% of subjects in the pooled CRd cohort and the CRd arm of PX-171-009 
had normal ECG at baseline compared to 64.8% in the Rd arm (results in Table 48). 
A review of all subjects with QTc abnormalities revealed that most of these subjects were receiving multiple 
concomitant medications known for their QTc prolongation effects, such as antibiotics, arrhythmia 
medications, or antinausea medications.

Race 
Adverse events by race in all pooled monotherapy cohort were reported in 99.4%, 100% and 100% of White, 
Black, and Other race subjects, respectively. Serious AEs by race in all pooled monotherapy cohort were 
reported in 47.6%, 54.0% and 49.1% of White, Black, and Other race subjects, respectively. The number of 
non-White subjects in the CRd arm was 17 (10 Black and 7 Other) and 18 in the Rd arm (10 Black and 8 
Other), compared to the number of White subjects (375 CRd arm and 371 Rd arm).  
Region 
In the CRd arm of PX-171-009, the subject incidence of any AE was 100% for North America and 90.3% for 
Europe. In the Rd arm, the subject incidence of TEAEs was 100% and 88.0% in North America and Europe, 
respectively. The subject incidence rates of SAEs were 59.8% and 59.3% in North America and Europe 
respectively in the CRd arm of PX-171-009 while the corresponding rates in the Rd arm were 53.6% and 
52.5%. 
Baseline ECOG Performance Score 
Subject incidence rates of AEs by baseline ECOG performance scores were analysed for ECOG performance 
scores of 0, 1, and 2. Adverse events by baseline ECOG status in the CRd arm of PX-171-009 were reported 
in 98.2%, 95.8%, and 97.4% of subjects with an ECOG of 0, 1, and 2, respectively. Serious AEs by the 
corresponding ECOG status were reported in 59.1%, 60.8%, and 59.0%, respectively. In the Rd arm of PX-
171-009, AEs by baseline ECOG status in were reported in 99.4%, 95.6%, and 100% of subjects with an

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
In clinical study PX-171-008, carfilzomib was administered concomitantly with oral midazolam, a CYP3A 
substrate. Study results showed that the PK of midazolam were unaffected by concomitant carfilzomib 
administration.  
Carfilzomib showed marginal inhibitory effects on P-glycoproteins (P-gp) in vitro and is unlikely to be affected 
by P-gp inhibitors or inducers (IV administration and extensive metabolization). 
In the clinical studies, there were no restrictions on concomitant medication use based on anticipated or 
reported drug–drug interactions, including those with cytochrome P450 inhibitors or inducers. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In PX-171-009, AEs led to delay or non administration of ≥ 1 dose of any study treatment (ie, carfilzomib, 
lenalidomide, or dexamethasone) in 78.6% of subjects in the CRd arm and 63.0% of subjects in the Rd arm. 
Adverse events that led to delay or non administration of ≥ 1 study treatment with subject incidence ≥ 2% 
higher in the CRd arm than in the Rd arm included URTI, respiratory tract infection, pyrexia, neutropenia, 
bronchitis, thrombocytopenia, pneumonia, increased ALT, asthenia, and rash. Amongst the pooled CRd 20/27 
mg/m2 cohort, diarrhoea led to a delay or non administration of ≥ 1 study treatment in 8.1% of subjects, 
which is ≥ 2% higher than in the Rd arm. In PX-171-009, an AE led to delay or non adminitration specifically 
of carfilzomib in 63.0% of subjects. The most frequent of such events (in ≥3% of subjects) included

neutropenia, URTI, pneumonia, respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, thrombocytopenia, pyrexia, diarrhoea, 
and fatigue. 
Within PX-171-009, 56.9% of subjects in the CRd arm and 51.9% in the Rd arm had an AE leading to dose 
reduction of any study treatments (ie, either carfilzomib, lenalidomide, or dexamethasone). The only AEs 
leading to dose reduction of any study treatment with a ≥ 2% higher subject incidence rate in the CRd arm 
compared to the Rd arm were neutropenia (13.0% CRd, 8.7% Rd) and thrombocytopenia (7.9% CRd,3.6% 
Rd). Conversely, the AE of tremor led to dose reduction more frequently in the Rd arm (0.3% CRd, 2.8% 
Rd). Adverse events specifically leading to reduction of carfilzomib occurred in 11.2% of CRd subjects. The 
AEs most frequently leading to reduction of carfilzomib within this study include thrombocytopenia, 
neutropenia, fatigue, and congestive cardiac failure. In the Rd arm, AEs most frequently leading to dose 
reduction included oedema, anaemia, insomnia, neutropenia, and decreased neutrophil count. Adverse 
events leading to dose reduction of lenalidomide were reported in 43.4% of subjects in the CRd arm and 
38.3% of subjects in the Rd arm. The AEs most frequently leading to reduction of lenalidomide within this 
study included neutropenia (12.5% CRd, 8.7% Rd) and thrombocytopenia (7.7% CRd, 3.6% Rd). For the 
pooled CRd cohort, 55.2% of subjects had an AE leading to dose reduction. The only AEs leading to dose 
reduction with a ≥ 2% higher subject incidence rate in the pooled CRd cohort compared to the control arm of 
PX-171-009 were thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. 
Post marketing experience 
Onyx received a total of 2177 post marketing cases that contained 6985 AEs from worldwide sources 
cumulatively from the International Birth Date through 8 May 2014, of which the majority were non-serious 
(n = 5422) and the remainder were serious (n = 1563), including 356 events that resulted in a fatal 
outcome. Of the 6985 total events, the majority were reported under the indication of plasma cell myeloma 
(multiple myeloma) or plasma cell myeloma in remission (n = 6149 in total). Of the 356 fatal events, the 
most commonly reported PTs were plasma cell myeloma (n = 128) and PD (n = 63). No overdoses have been 
reported in subjects receiving carfilzomib in the post-marketing setting. 
The SOCs that contained the most number of events included the General Disorders and Administration Site 
Conditions (n = 1621), Investigations (n = 966), and GI Disorders (n = 588). The most commonly reported 
listed events within these SOCs were fatigue (n = 400), PD (n = 177), and nausea (n = 158); and most 
common unlisted events included platelet count decreased (n = 151), haemoglobin decreased (n = 108), and 
White blood cell count decreased (n = 87). 
Overall, the majority of the events (n = 5422) were reported as non-serious. Of all the non-serious and listed 
events (n = 2362), the most commonly reported events included fatigue, dyspnoea, nausea, asthenia, 
diarrhoea, PD, pyrexia, headache, pain, insomnia, back pain, and anaemia. Of all the non-serious and 
unlisted events (n = 3060), the most commonly reported events included decreased platelet count, 
peripheral neuropathy, decreased haemoglobin, drug ineffective, decreased white blood cell count, 
nasopharyngitis, decreased red blood cell count, local swelling, increased blood pressure, malaise, infusion 
site pain, and abnormal blood count. 
The remaining events (n = 1563) were reported as serious. Of all the serious and listed events (n = 771), 
the most commonly reported events included plasma cell myeloma, pneumonia, PD, congestive cardiac 
failure, renal failure, pyrexia, dyspnoea, acute renal failure, sepsis, anaemia, asthenia, and pain. Of all the 
serious and unlisted events (n = 792), the most commonly reported events included death, decreased 
platelet count, dehydration, pulmonary hypertension, myocardial infarction, pulmonary oedema, septic shock,

decreased haemoglobin, cardiac failure, atrial fibrillation, influenza, mental status changes, chest pain, 
pleural effusion, and confusional state. 
The majority of the events reported in the post-marketing setting were non-serious. Overall, a review of the 
fatal events identified haemorrhagic events with fatal outcomes; review of the serious/non-serious and listed 
events were consistent with the known safety profile of carfilzomib monotherapy; and review of the 
serious/non-serious and unlisted events revealed the following notable observations:  
A review of the Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders SOC identified unlisted events including pancytopenia 
and febrile neutropenia. Anaemia, leukaemia, and thrombocytopenia are listed events as per the CDS. There 
was one fatal event of platelet count decreased (coded to the Investigations SOC) reported. Pancytopenia will 
continue to be monitored through routine pharmacovigilance activities.Of the 223 events reported under this 
SOC, 17 were pancytopenia, including 8 as serious (one with a fatal outcome). The case with a fatal outcome 
described a subject with anaemia and thrombocytopenia prior to the initiation of carfilzomib therapy. 
A range of haemorrhagic events were noted in patients administered carfilzomib: epistaxis (n=28), 
gastrointestinal haemorrhagic events (n=22; 17 reported as serious including 1 with a fatal outcome), 
contusion (n=14), subdural hematoma (n=8, 6 with a fatal outcome; 2 patients had concurrent events of 
thrombocytopenia), haemoptysis (n=3), cerebral haemorrhage (n=3, 1 with a fatal outcome), intracranial 
haemorrhage (n=3, all with a fatal outcome), post-procedural haemorrhage (n=2, 1 with a fatal outcome), 
and pulmonary haemorrhage (n=1). Haemorrhagic events were observed across a number of SOCs, including 
Gastrointestinal Disorders, Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications, Nervous System Disorders and 
Respiratory, and Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders.  
A review of the Cardiac Disorders SOC and Cardiac Toxicity EOI identified unlisted events including atrial 
fibrillation, myocardial infarction, and acute myocardial infarction. Myocardial infarction is a modification of a 
previously adverse drug reaction, myocardial ischemia, and is a new safety risk identified based on the 
comprehensive safety assessment of both clinical trial and postmarketing data. Of the 219 events reported 
under this SOC, 24 were atrial fibrillation, including 12 as serious. There were 4 serious events of acute 
myocardial infarction and 15 events of myocardial infarction, of which 14 were serious. Fatal outcomes were 
reported in 2 of the acute myocardial infarction events and in 2 of the myocardial infarction events. 
Of the 160 events reported under Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications, 26 were coded to the PT of 
fall, including 4 that were reported as serious (1 with a fatal outcome).  
Of the 208 events reported under Metabolism and Nutritional Disorders SOC, 52 were dehydration (a new 
safety identified risk), including 23 as serious. Many were reported with concurrent listed events of nausea, 
vomiting and diarrhoea. In addition, there was 1 event of TLS with a fatal outcome reported. 
Of the 501 events reported under Nervous System Disorders SOC, 97 were peripheral neuropathy (a new 
safety identified risk). The outcomes were reported as improved/resolved (6 events), unchanged (55 events), 
and unknown (36 events). All of them were reported as non-serious and there were events reported with 
concurrent events of fall. There were 2 events of PRES reported in the post marketing setting during the 
reporting period. One event of PRES occurred following the initiation of carfilzomib treatment. 
There were 178 events received during this reporting period where the MedDRA PTs were coded to the Renal 
and Urinary Disorders SOC. Of the 178 events, 79 were non-serious and 99 were serious, including 19 events 
with a fatal outcome. Of the 19 fatal events, the reported PTs were renal failure (n = 11), renal failure acute 
(n = 6), renal failure chronic (n = 2). The most frequently reported serious AEs were renal failure (n = 48)

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Overall, the safety database for carfilzomib is quite large as regards the total number of patients. However, 
median exposure to carfilzomib in pivotal study PX-171-009 was 70.3 weeks (18.0 cycles) with the numbers 
of patients yielding safety data at the proposed dose range of RCd with exposure of 6 cycles being 339, 
exposure of > 6 to ≤12 cycles being 279, exposure of > 12 to ≤18 cycles being 239 and with exposure of 
>18 cycles being 0, because carfilzomib was administered for up to a maximum of 18 cycles, after which 
subjects continued on lenalidomide and dexamethasone until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
Treatment with Kyprolis combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for longer than 18 cycles should be 
based on an individual benefit risk assessment, as the data on the tolerability and toxicity of carfilzomib 
beyond 18 cycles are limited  (SmPC section 4.2). 
The safety profile of CRd is characterised by a broad range of adverse events including grade 3/4 AEs and 
deaths in the setting of AEs. The main reported AEs were thrombocytopenia with associated haemorrhage, 
neutropenia, severe infections, diarrhoea, vomiting, increased blood creatinine, uric acid, aminotransferases 
(AST, ALT), vascular disorders. The safety profile also included fatigue, asthenia, infusion reaction, pyrexia, 
and peripheral oedema, constipation, dyspnoea, cough, cataract, the noted events in the skin SOC, deep 
venous thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE) and myocardial infarction; as well as a variety of low 
electrolyte levels, including hypokalemia, hypomagnesaemia, hypophosphatemia and hypocalcaemia. 
Lenalidomide is known to have considerable toxicity, also overlapping with that of carfilzomib and 
dexamethasone, but the frequency of some important adverse events is several times higher for the CRd arm 
as compared to Rd arm. However, in this regard, it is of note that in study PX-171-009 there was a relative 
increase of frequency and severity observed regarding neutropenia and thrombocytopenia for the CRd arm as 
compared to the Rd arm. The frequencies of all-grade neutropenia were 37.8% vs 33.7%, for the CRd arm as 
compared to the Rd arm, and of Grade 3 / 4 were (29.6% vs 26.5%), respectively. The frequencies of all-
grade thrombocytopenia were 29.3% vs 22.9%, for the CRd arm as compared to the Rd arm, and of Grade 3 
/ 4 were (16.8% vs 12.3%), respectively. 
Carfilzomib like bortezomib are a proteasome inhibitor but carfilzomib is highly selective and inhibits the 
proteasome irreversibly with minimal off-target activity and is active in bortezomib-refractory cells in vitro 
and in mouse models. It is of note that in study PX-171-009 there was no increase of frequency and severity 
observed regarding peripheral neuropathy for the CRd arm. The frequencies of all-grade peripheral 
neuropathy were 8.7%, and of Grade 3 / 4 were 1.0%. 
In study PX-171-009, the subject incidence of the rate of AEs leading to discontinuation of any study drug 
was 26.0% in the CRd arm and 25.2% in the Rd arm. The most common AEs leading to discontinuation of 
any study drug in either study arm included thrombocytopenia, insomnia, neutropenia, anemia, pneumonia, 
and URTI. Adverse events of any grade leading to discontinuation of lenalidomide were also balanced 
between study arms (18.6% CRd, 18.5% Rd); thus, the addition of carfilzomib did not appear to adversely 
affect lenalidomide dosing. The AEs most frequently leading to reduction of lenalidomide within this study 
included neutropenia (12.5% CRd, 8.7% Rd) and thrombocytopenia (7.7% CRd, 3.6% Rd). For the pooled 
CRd cohort, 55.2% of subjects had an AE leading to dose reduction. 
AEs led to delay or non-administration of ≥ 1 dose of any study treatment (ie, carfilzomib, lenalidomide, or 
dexamethasone) in 78.6% of subjects in the CRd arm and 63.0% of subjects in the Rd arm. Adverse events 
that led to delay or non-administration of ≥ 1 study treatment with subject incidence ≥ 2% higher in the CRd 
arm than in the Rd arm included URTI, respiratory tract infection, pyrexia, neutropenia, bronchitis, 
thrombocytopenia, pneumonia, increased ALT, asthenia, and rash. Amongst the pooled CRd 20/27 mg/m2 
Assessment report  
EMA/670306/2015 
Page 121/142 
 
  
  
cohort, diarrhea led to a delay or nonadministration of ≥ 1 study treatment in 8.1% of subjects, which is ≥ 
2% higher than in the Rd arm. 
The rare events of PRES and TTP/HUS were not noted in the clinical database and were identified from post 
marketing reports and/or SAE reports from ongoing Onyx or Investigator Sponsored Trials (ISTs).  
In general, deaths on study were balanced between the two study arms of PX-171-009. A total of 6.9% of 
subjects in each study arm died due to an AE, and deaths due to PD were 0.5% in CRd arm versus 1.3% in 
Rd arm. Deaths due to cardiac (2.6% vs. 1.8% respectively), renal (0.0% vs. 0.3%), infections (2.3% vs. 
2.6%), and other AEs (2.3% vs. 2,6%), were relatively balanced between treatment arms. It is noteworthy 
that in study PX-171-009 the rate of deaths on-treatment, but not due to the study indication of MM, was 
higher in the Rd arm (8.5%) compared to the CRd arm (7.7%).  
Two subjects in the CRd arm died due to a bleeding event. One subject died due to a subdural hematoma 
resulting from an accident (subject was hit by a bicycle) and the other as a result of a massive subarachnoid 
haemorrhage preceded by Grade 4 thrombocytopenia. Both of these deaths occurred within 7 days of the last 
dose of carfilzomib. 
Cardiac-related events 
In clinical studies with Kyprolis, cardiac failure (reported in approximately 7% of subjects), myocardial 
infarction (reported in approximately 2% of subjects) and myocardial ischaemia (reported in approximately 
1% of subjects) typically occurred early in the course of Kyprolis therapy (< 5 cycles). Approximately 65% of 
cardiac failure events, 75% of myocardial infarction events, and 83% of myocardial ischaemia events were 
grade ≥ 3 events (SmPC section 4.8). 
New or worsening cardiac failure (e.g. congestive cardiac failure, pulmonary oedema, decreased ejection 
fraction), myocardial ischaemia and infarction have occurred following administration of Kyprolis. Death due 
to cardiac arrest has occurred within a day of Kyprolis administration and fatal outcomes have been reported 
with cardiac failure and myocardial infarction (SmPC section 4.4). 
While adequate hydration is required prior to dosing in cycle 1, all patients should be monitored for evidence 
of volume overload, especially patients at risk for cardiac failure. The total volume of fluids may be adjusted 
as clinically indicated in patients with baseline cardiac failure or who are at risk for cardiac failure (see section 
4.2).  
Patients should stop Kyprolis for grade 3 or 4 cardiac events until recovery and they should consider whether 
to restart Kyprolis at 1 dose level reduction based on a benefit/risk assessment (see section 4.2).  
Cardiac adverse events were reported in Study PX-171-009 as occurring at a higher frequency in the 
carfilzomib-treated arm compared to the control arm. The mechanism for the cardiac effects is unclear, 
however due to the on-target specificity of the carfilzomib molecule and the similarity of the cardiac effects 
observed pre-clinically and clinically with other proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib, the effects are 
likely pharmacological. This cardiac toxicity associated to carfilzomib regimen, was reported in a population 
with a probably lower cardiovascular risk than in the actual intended population (elderly MM patients). 
Treatment of these patients should be based on a comprehensive medical assessment and subsequent 
determination of an acceptable benefit:risk ratio on a patient-by-patient basis. This rationale is based on the 
large unmet need in subjects with relapsed multiple myeloma who may benefit from carfilzomib together with 
the precedent that an optimized regimen of cardiac care prior to and during treatment may mitigate the 
occurrence of heart failure-related adverse events.

Cardiovascular AEs were  reported as the primary cause of death in 10 subjects in the CRd arm and 7 
subjects in the Rd arm. These included 5 deaths due to ischemic heart disease (ie, myocardial infarction or 
acute coronary syndrome [3 subjects in CRd arm, 2 subjects in Rd arm]), 7 deaths due to cardiac failure (3 
subjects in CRd arm, 4 subjects Rd arm), 2 deaths due to cardiac arrest (both on CRd arm) and 1 death each 
due to circulatory collapse, left ventricular dysfunction (both on CRd arm), and arrhythmia (Rd arm). Of the 
10 deaths due to cardiovascular AEs in the CRd arm, subjects had been receiving study treatment for varying 
lengths of time ranging from 4 days to 453 days. 
Cardiac toxicity (cardiac failure, myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction & cardiac arrest) has been 
classified as an identified risk in the Risk Management Plan.  
Pulmonary toxicity 
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute respiratory failure, and acute diffuse infiltrative 
pulmonary disease such as pneumonitis and interstitial lung disease have occurred in patients receiving 
Kyprolis. Some of these events have been fatal. Evaluate and stop Kyprolis until resolved and consider 
whether to restart Kyprolis based on a benefit/risk assessment (SmPC, section 4.4). Pulmonary toxicites have 
been classified as an identified risk in the Risk Management Plan.  
Pulmonary hypertension 
Pulmonary hypertension has been reported in patients treated with Kyprolis. Some of these events have been 
fatal. Evaluate as appropriate. Stop Kyprolis for pulmonary hypertension until resolved or returned to 
baseline and consider whether to restart Kyprolis based on a benefit/risk assessment (see section 4.2). 
Pulmonary hypertension has been classified as an identified risk in the Risk Management Plan.  
Dyspnoea 
Dyspnoea was reported in approximately 30% of subjects in clinical studies with Kyprolis. The majority of 
dyspnoea adverse reactions were non serious (> 15% of dyspnoea events were grade ≥ 3 events), resolved, 
rarely resulted in treatment discontinuation, and had an onset early in the course of study (< 3 cycles) 
(SmPC, section 4.8). 
Dyspnea should be evaluated to exclude cardiopulmonary conditions including cardiac failure and pulmonary 
syndromes. Patients should stop Kyprolis for grade 3 and 4 dyspnoea until resolved or returned to baseline 
and consider whether to restart Kyprolis based on a benefit/risk assessment (SmPC, section 4.4). Dyspnea 
has been classified as an identified risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
Hypertension including hypertensive crises 
Hypertensive crises (hypertensive urgency or hypertensive emergency) have occurred following 
administration of Kyprolis. Some of these events have been fatal. In clinical studies, hypertension adverse 
events occurred in approximately 20% of subjects and approximately 30% of these events were grade ≥ 3, 
but hypertensive crises occurred in < 0.5% of subjects. The incidence of hypertension adverse events was 
similar between those with or without a prior medical history of hypertension(SmPC, section 4.8).  
All patients should be routinely evaluated for hypertension and treated as needed. If the hypertension cannot 
be controlled, the Kyprolis dose should be reduced. In case of hypertensive crises, patients should stop 
Kyprolis until resolved or returned to baseline and they should consider whether to restart Kyprolis based on 
a benefit/risk assessment (SmC sections 4.2 and 4.4). Hypertension including hypertensive crises has been 
classified as an identified risk in the Risk Management Plan.

EMA/670306/2015

Acute renal failure 
Cases of acute renal failure have been reported in patients who received Kyprolis. Acute renal failure was 
reported more frequently in patients with advanced relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who received 
Kyprolis monotherapy. The risk was increased in patients with a decrease in estimated creatinine clearance, 
calculated using Cockcroft and Gault equation, prior to receiving Kyprolis. Renal function should be monitored 
monthly with measurement of the serum creatinine and/or estimated creatinine clearance. Dose should be 
reduced or treatment should be stopped as appropriate (SmPC, sections 4.2 and 4.8). Acute renal failure has 
been classified as an identified risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
Tumour lysis syndrome 
Cases of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS), including with fatal outcome, have been reported in patients who 
received Kyprolis (SmPC, section 4.8). Patients with a high tumour burden should be considered to be at 
greater risk for TLS. Patients should be well hydrated before administration of Kyprolis in cycle 1, and in 
subsequent cycles as needed (SmPC, section 4.2). Uric acid lowering medicinal products should be 
considered in patients at high risk for TLS. Evidence of TLS during treatment should be monitored for, 
including regular measurement of serum electrolytes, and manage promptly. Kyprolis should be stopped until 
TLS is resolved (SmPC, section 4.2). Adequate hydration is required before dose administration in cycle 1, 
especially in patients at high risk of tumour lysis syndrome or renal toxicity (SmPC, section 4.4). Tumour 
lysis syndrome has been classified as an identified risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
Infusion reactions 
Infusion reactions, including life-threatening reactions, have been reported in patients who received Kyprolis. 
Symptoms may include fever, chills, arthralgia, myalgia, facial flushing, facial oedema, vomiting, weakness, 
shortness of breath, hypotension, syncope, chest tightness, or angina. These reactions can occur immediately 
following or up to 24 hours after administration of Kyprolis. Dexamethasone should be administered prior to 
Kyprolis to reduce the incidence and severity of reactions (see section 4.2). Infusion reactions have been 
classified as an identified risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
Thrombocytopenia 
Thrombocytopenia was reported in approximately 40% of subjects in clinical studies with Kyprolis and 
approximately 60% of these events were grade ≥ 3. Kyprolis causes thrombocytopenia through inhibition of 
platelet budding from megakaryocytes resulting in a classic cyclical thrombocytopenia with platelet nadirs 
occurring around day 8 or 15 of each 28-day cycle and usually associated with recovery to baseline by the 
start of the next cycle (SmPC, section 4.8). Platelet counts should be monitored frequently during treatment 
with Kyprolis. Dose should be reduced or stopped as appropriate (SmPC, sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Thrombocytopenia has been classified as an identified risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
Hepatic toxicity 
Cases of hepatic failure, including fatal cases, have been reported in < 1% of subjects in clinical studies with 
Kyprolis.  Kyprolis can cause elevations of serum transaminases (see section 4.8). Dose should be reduced or 
stopped as appropriate (see section 4.2). Liver enzymes should be monitored at treatment initiation and 
monthly during treatment with carfilzomib, regardless of baseline values (SmPC, sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8). 
Hepatic toxicity has been classified as an identified risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
Assessment report  
EMA/670306/2015

Thrombotic Microangiopathy 
Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and haemolytic 
uraemic syndrome (TTP/HUS) have been reported in patients who received Kyprolis. Some of these events 
have been fatal. Signs and symptoms of TTP/HUS should be monitored for. If the diagnosis is suspected, stop 
Kyprolis and evaluate patients for possible TTP/HUS. If the diagnosis of TTP/HUS is excluded, Kyprolis can be 
restarted. The safety of reinitiating Kyprolis therapy in patients previously experiencing TTP/HUS is not 
known (SmPC, section 4.4). Thrombotic microangiopathy has been classified as an identified risk in the Risk 
Management Plan. 
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome 
Cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) have been reported in patients receiving 
Kyprolis. PRES, formerly termed reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS), is a rare, 
neurological disorder, which can present with seizure, headache, lethargy, confusion, blindness, altered 
consciousness, and other visual and neurological disturbances, along with hypertension, and the diagnosis is 
confirmed by neuro radiological imaging. Kyprolis should be discontinued if PRES is suspected. The safety of 
reinitiating Kyprolis therapy in patients previously experiencing PRES is not known (SmPC, section 4.8).  
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been classified as an identified risk in the Risk 
Management Plan. 
Febrile neutropenia 
Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.8% of subjects in the pooled CRd cohort and in 2.0% of subjects in the 
PX-171-009 CRd arm compared to 1% in the Rd arm. Of the 13 CRd-treated subjects with either a ≥ Grade 3 
AE or SAE of febrile neutropenia, 10 subjects had concomitant (within a 2-week window of the start of febrile 
neutropenia) AE of infection. Within PX-171-009, the neutropenia was among most frequent ≥ Grade 3 AEs. 
Grade 3 and higher AEs reported with a ≥ 2% subject incidence rate in the CRd arm as compared to the Rd 
arm included neutropenia. Febrile neutropenia has been classified as an identified risk in the Risk 
Management Plan. In addition, febrile neutropenia is mentioned in the section 4.2 for dose modification. 
Potential risks 
Herpes zoster infections: Subject incidence rates of Herpes virus infections were 3.3% (0% ≥ Grade 3) in the 
CRd arm of PX-171-009, compared to 4.9% (0.3% ≥ Grade 3) in the Rd arm. No subject in the CRd arm of 
PX-171-009 required dose reduction or treatment discontinuation for this AE.  
Antiviral prophylaxis should be considered in patients being treated with Kyprolis to decrease the risk of 
herpes zoster reactivation. The majority of patients included in studies with Kyprolis received antiviral 
prophylaxis; due to this fact it is not possible to calculate the true incidence of herpes zoster infection in 
patients treated with Kyprolis (SmPC, section 4.2).  Herpes zoster infections have been classified as a 
potential risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity: There are no data from the use of carfilzomib in pregnant women.  
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity. Based on its mechanism of action and findings in 
animals, Kyprolis can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Kyprolis should not be 
used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with Kyprolis. If Kyprolis 
is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this medicinal product, the patient 
should be apprised of the potential hazard to the foetus (SmPC, section 4.6). Reproductive and 
developmental toxicity has been classified as a potential risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
Assessment report  
EMA/670306/2015

Missing information  
Use in patients with hepatic impairment: Patients with hepatic impairment have not been systematically 
evaluated. This has been adequately reflected in the SmPC (see section 4.2 and 5.2). An open-label, single-
arm, phase 1 study of the pharmacokinetics and safety of carfilzomib in subjects with advanced malignancies 
and varying degrees of hepatic impairment  is ongoing and the final CSR will be submitted by Q2 2016 (see 
Risk Management Plan). 
Cardiac failure: The pronounced increasing risk of AE in the older population, especially the cardiac failure 
events in subjects >75 y, required additional precautions for use. 
The risk of cardiac failure is increased in elderly patients (≥  75 years). Patients with New York Heart 
Association (NYHA) Class III and IV heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, and conduction abnormalities 
uncontrolled by medicinal products were not eligible for the clinical trials. These patients may be at greater 
risk for cardiac complications. Patients with signs or symptoms of NYHA Class III or IV cardiac failure, recent 
history of myocardial infarction (in the last 4 months), and in patients with uncontrolled angina or 
arrhythmias, should have a comprehensive medical assessment, prior to starting treatment with Kyprolis. 
This assessment should optimise the patient’s status, with particular attention to blood pressure and fluid 
management. Subsequently patients should be treated with caution and remain under close follow-up.Use in 
patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease including recent myocardial infarction (within the last 
4 months), NYHA Class III or IV cardiac failure, uncontrolled angina and uncontrolled arrhythmias (SmPC 
section 4.4).  
Data about use in pregnant or breastfeeding is missing. This has been adequately reflected in the SmPC (see 
sections 4.6 and 5.3) and is reflected in the Risk Management Plan. 
Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Kyprolis has  minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue, dizziness, fainting, blurred 
vision, somnolence and/or a drop in blood pressure have been observed in clinical trials. Patients being 
treated with Kyprolis should be advised not to drive or operate machinery in the event that they experience 
any of these symptoms (SmPC section 4.7). 
Overdose 
There is currently insufficient information to draw conclusions about the safety of doses higher than those 
evaluated in clinical studies. Acute onset of chills, hypotension, renal insufficiency, thrombocytopenia and 
lymphopenia has been reported following a dose of 200 mg of Kyprolis administered in error.There is no 
known specific antidote for carfilzomib overdose. In the event of an overdose, the patient should be 
monitored, specifically for the side effects and/or adverse reactions to Kyprolis listed in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC (SmPC section 4.9). 
Contraception 
It cannot be excluded that the efficacy of oral contraceptives may be reduced during carfilzomib treatment 
(SmPC section 4.5). In addition, due to an increased risk of venous thrombosis associated with carfilzomib, 
females should avoid the use of hormonal contraceptives that are associated with a risk of thrombosis during 
treatment with carfilzomib (SmPC section 4.8). If a patient is currently using oral contraceptives or a 
hormonal method of contraception that is associated with a risk of thrombosis, the patient should switch to 
an alternative method of effective contraception (SmPC section 4.6). 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have been

included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, there is a pattern of more frequent adverse events and more frequent Grade 3/4 adverse events in 
patients treated with CRd (83.7%) compared to those treated with Rd (81.2%) with anaemia, fatigue, 
diarrhoea, thrombocytopenia, nausea, pyrexia, dyspnoea, respiratory tract infection, cough and peripheral 
oedema being the most common adverse reactions. 
The safety profile of CRd was to some extent consistent with the previously known profile of the individual 
drugs despite the longer duration of therapy, and the use of triplet therapy. 
In general the combination of carfilzomib with lenalidomide and low dose dexamethasone in PX-171-009 
study seems to increase the toxicity of Rd and the SAEs, however, the adverse event profile is considered 
acceptable and manageable.

2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Kyprolis (CARFILZOMIB) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained 
in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Study PX-171-009 has provided convincing evidence of clinical efficacy of  carfilzomib in combination with 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone in terms of the primary endpoint PFS, compared to lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone, in adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy.  
The risk of disease progression or death was reduced by 31% (HR=0.69, 95% CI: 0.57, 0.83; p value 
<0.0001).  The Kaplan-Meier estimated median duration of PFS was 26.3 months vs. 17.6 months in the CRd 
arm and Rd arm, respectively. In addition, the results were consistent across the pre-specified subgroups for 
PFS.   
The sensitivity analyses (unstratified, bias adjusted, interval censored, censoring by the initiation of non-
protocol, anti-cancer therapy versus not initiating such therapy, Onyx’s computerized algorithm and 
investigator assessment) confirmed the reliability of the PFS results, with HRs quite similar among them. 
The main secondary endpoint, OS, did not cross the prespecified early stopping boundary for the interim 
analysis, even though the result points out a clear positive trend in favour of CRd (HR = 0.79 [95% CI: 0.63, 
0.99]; log-rank p = 0.0182) with more deaths in the control arm at the time of the cut-off (143 [36.1%] vs 
162 [40.9%]). 
Regarding the secondary and exploratory variables the use of the combination of CRd seem to provide a 
positive benefit in terms of ORR  (CRd 87.1%; Rd 66.7%; p < 0.0001), duration of response (CRd 28.6 
months; Rd 21.2 months), and QoL. More patients in the CRd arm had a Stringent Complete Response (14% 
vs 3%) CR (18% vs 5%) and VGPR (38% vs 31%).

EMA/670306/2015 
Page 135/142 
 
  
  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The uncertainties that were identified during the assessment regarding some subgroup of patients (pure 
refractory to bortezomib and/or lenalidomide) and the initially proposed indication and the duration of 
treatment were satisfactorily addressed (see discussion on clinical efficacy). 
One remaining uncertainty is the treatment effect in terms of OS associated with CRd. Despite the fact that 
CRd is pointing out a clear trend in OS benefit, the data are still immature. Additional follow-up will further 
quantify the OS benefit of CRd over Rd (see discussion on clinical efficacy).   
Risks 
The most common adverse reactions (occurring in > 20% of subjects) were: anaemia, fatigue, diarrhoea, 
thrombocytopenia, nausea, pyrexia, dyspnoea, respiratory tract infection, cough and peripheral oedema. The 
most serious adverse reactions that may occur during the CRd treatment include: cardiac toxicity, dyspnoea, 
acute renal failure, tumour lysis syndrome, infusion reactions, thrombocytopenia, hepatic toxicity, posterior 
reversible encephalopathy syndrome and thrombocytopenic thrombotic purpura/haemolytic uraemic 
syndrome. 
A total of 142 subjects (36.2%) in the CRd arm, and 160 subjects (41.1%) in the Rd arm had died at the 
time of the data cut-off. A total of 30 subjects (7.7%) in the CRd arm and 33 subjects (8.5%) in the Rd arm 
died on study (ie, within 30 days after their last dose of any study treatment: carfilzomib, lenalidomide, or 
dexamethasone).Within PX-171-009, the subject incidence of the rate of AEs leading to discontinuation of 
any study drug was 26.0% in the CRd arm and 25.2% in the Rd arm. AEs led to delay or nonadministration 
of ≥  1 dose of any study treatment (ie, carfilzomib, lenalidomide, or dexamethasone) in 78.6% of subjects in 
the CRd arm and 63.0% of subjects in the Rd arm. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Cardiac adverse events were reported in Study PX-171-009 as occurring at a higher frequency in the 
carfilzomib-treated arm compared to the control arm. The mechanism for the cardiac effects is unclear, 
however due to the on-target specificity of the carfilzomib molecule and the similarity of the cardiac effects 
observed pre-clinically and clinically with other proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib, the effects are 
likely pharmacological. This cardiac toxicity associated to carfilzomib regimen, was reported in a population 
with a probably lower cardiovascular risk than in the actual intended population (elderly MM patients). 
Treatment of these patients should be based on a comprehensive medical assessment and subsequent 
determination of an acceptable benefit:risk ratio on a patient-by-patient basis. This rationale is based on the 
large unmet need in subjects with relapsed multiple myeloma who may benefit from carfilzomib together with 
the precedent that an optimized regimen of cardiac care prior to and during treatment may mitigate the 
occurrence of heart failure-related adverse events. These have been adequately reflected in the SmPC (see 
sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8) and cardiac toxicity (cardiac failure, myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction & 
cardiac arrest) has been classified as an identified risk in the Risk Management Plan.

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The gain in PFS of 8.7 months observed with the combination of CRd is considered clinically meaningful. No 
other treatment for MM has achieved the level of PFS prolongation as the combination of CRd in the proposed 
line of treatment. In addition, CRd showed a clear trend in OS benefit, although the data is not mature.  
Regarding the toxicity associated with CRd there is a pattern of more frequent adverse events and more 
frequent Grade 3/4 adverse events in patients treated with CRd (83.7%) compared to those treated with Rd 
(81.2%). However, in the light of the data related to discontinuations, the combination seems tolerable, 
given the comparable rates of discontinuation between arms in the main study (26% vs 25.2%). The toxicity 
appears to be manageable within the context of this disease, as reflected in the percentage of patients on 
treatment at cycle 18 (61% vs 42.2% CRd vs Rd respectively). 
Benefit-risk balance 
The delay in disease progression observed with CRd is clinically relevant and appears superior to available 
alternatives in the setting of relapsed MM. Therefore, given the overall accepted safety profile, which is 
considered manageable in the current context, the benefit risk for CRd is considered positive.

Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
There is an unmet medical need of better treatments capable of delaying the progression of MM. This is of 
utmost important given the absence of curative treatment and bearing in mind that eventually patients would 
become refractory to treatment. During the recent years several new drugs have been incorporated to the 
therapeutic armamentarium, with proteasome inhibitors and IMIDs standard of care therapies.  
Other regimen containing three active treatments, such as bortezomib, thalidomide and high dose 
dexamethasone (VTD) or bortezomib, lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone (VRD), obtained positive 
results, but far from those achieved by CRd. The combination of VTD obtained a median PFS of 19.5 months 
(Garderet L et al., 2012), whereas VRD reached 9.5 months of median PFS (Richardson et al., 2014). Even 
the more recent triplet of panobinostat, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (PVD) showed a lower median of 
PFS in a comparable population (San-Miguel et al., 2014). 
The comparison in terms of ORR also highlights the apparent superiority of CRd vs alternatives (87.1%; 
60.7%; 64% in CRd, PVD and VRD respectively).  
Only in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients, lenalidomide and dexamethasone achieved similar 
results in PFS to those obtained by CRd in the current application, with medians range between 21 and 26 
months (study MM-020). In the study MM-020 dexamethasone was administered as 40 mg once daily on 
Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each 28- day cycle. The latter, low dose of dexamethasone, can be one of the 
explanations when it comes to analysing the unexpected high PFS results for Rd in the PX-171-009 trial. The 
reduced toxicity associated to this lower regimen of dexamethasone could partially explain the outcomes.  
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Kyprolis is not similar to Thalidomide Celgene, Revlimid, 
Imnovid and Farydak within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See 
appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus decision 
that the risk-benefit balance of Kyprolis in the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have 
received at least one prior therapy in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone is favourable and 
therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
  Whenever  the  risk  management  system  is  modified,  especially  as  the  result  of  new  information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of data on the quality properties of the active substance, the CHMP considers that 
carfilzomib is qualified as a new active substance.

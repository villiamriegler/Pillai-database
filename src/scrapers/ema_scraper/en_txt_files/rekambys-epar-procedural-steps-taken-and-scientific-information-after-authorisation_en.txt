Oral bridging with other ART 
In a retrospective analysis of pooled data from 3 clinical 
studies (FLAIR, ATLAS-2M, and LATTE-2/study 200056), 29 
subjects were included who received oral bridging for a 
median duration of 59 days (25th and 75th percentile 53-
135) with ART other than rilpivirine plus cabotegravir 
(alternative oral bridging) during treatment with REKAMBYS 
plus cabotegravir long-acting (LA) intramuscular (IM) 
injections. The median age of subjects was 32 years, 14% 
were female, 31% were non-white, 97% received an 
integrase inhibitor (INI)-based regimen for alternative oral 
bridging, 41% received an NNRTI as part of their 
alternative oral bridging regimen (including rilpivirine in 
11/12 cases) and 62% received an NRTI. Three subjects 
withdrew during oral bridging or shortly following oral 
bridging for non-safety reasons. The majority (≥96%) of 
subjects maintained virologic suppression (plasma HIV-1 
RNA <50 c/mL). During bridging with alternative oral 
bridging and during the period following alternative oral 
bridging (up to 2 REKAMBYS plus cabotegravir injections 
following oral bridging), no cases of CVF (confirmed plasma 
HIV-1 RNA ≥200 c/mL) were observed.

Section 5.1.  
Every 2 months dosing 
Patients virologically suppressed (stable on prior ART for at 
least 6 months) 
The efficacy results at Week 96 are consistent with the 
results of the primary endpoint at Week 48. Rilpivirine plus 
cabotegravir injections administered every 2 months is 
non-inferior to rilpivirine and cabotegravir administered 
every month. The proportion of subjects having plasma 
HIV-1 RNA ≥50 c/mL at Week 96 in rilpivirine plus 
cabotegravir every 2 months dosing (n=522) and rilpivirine 
plus cabotegravir monthly dosing (n=523) was 2.1% and 
1.1% respectively (adjusted treatment difference between 
rilpivirine plus cabotegravir every 2 months dosing and 
monthly dosing [1.0; 95% CI: -0.6, 2.5]). The proportion 
of subjects having plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL at Week 96 
in rilpivirine plus cabotegravir every 2 months dosing and 
rilpivirine plus cabotegravir monthly dosing was 91% and 
90.2% respectively (adjusted treatment difference between 
rilpivirine plus cabotegravir every 2 months dosing and 
monthly dosing [0.8; 95% CI: -2.8, 4.3]). 
The efficacy results at Week 152 are consistent with the 
results of the primary endpoint at Week 48 and at Week 
96. Rilpivirine plus cabotegravir injections administered 
every 2 months is non-inferior to rilpivirine and 
cabotegravir administered every month. In an ITT analysis, 
the proportion of subjects having plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥50 
c/mL at Week 152 in rilpivirine plus cabotegravir every 2 
months dosing (n=522) and rilpivirine plus cabotegravir 
Page 4/9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
monthly dosing (n=523) was 2.7% and 1.0% respectively 
(adjusted treatment difference between rilpivirine plus 
cabotegravir every 2 months dosing and monthly dosing 
[1.7; 95% CI: 0.1, 3.3]). In an ITT analysis, the proportion 
of subjects having plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL at Week 
152 in rilpivirine plus cabotegravir every 2 months dosing 
and rilpivirine plus cabotegravir monthly dosing was 87% 
and 86% respectively (adjusted treatment difference 
between rilpivirine plus cabotegravir every 2 months dosing 
and monthly dosing [1.5; 95% CI: -2.6, 5.6]). 
Post-hoc analyses 
Multivariable analyses of pooled Phase 3 studies (ATLAS 
through 96 weeks, FLAIR through 124 weeks, ATLAS-2M 
through 152 weeks) examined the influence of various 
factors on the risk of CVF. The baseline factors analysis 
(BFA) examined baseline viral and participants 
characteristics and dosing regimen; and the multivariable 
analysis (MVA) included the baseline factors and 
incorporated post-baseline predicted plasma drug 
concentrations on CVF using regression modelling with a 
variable selection procedure. Following a total of 4291 
person-years, the unadjusted CVF incidence rate was 0.54 
per 100 person-years; 23 CVFs were reported (1.4% of 
1651 individuals in these studies). 
The BFA demonstrated rilpivirine resistance mutations 
(incidence rate ratio IRR=21.65, p<0.0001), HIV-1 subtype 
A6/A1 (IRR=12.87, p<0.0001), and body mass index 
IRR=1.09 per 1 unit increase, p=0.04; IRR=3.97 of ≥30 
kg/m2, p=0.01) were associated with CVF.  Other variables 
including Q4W or Q8W dosing, female gender, or 
CAB/INSTI resistance mutations had no significant 
association with CVF. A combination of at least 2 of the 
Page 5/9 
 
 
 
 
 
following key baseline factors was associated with an 
increased risk of CVF: rilpivirine resistance associated 
mutations, HIV-1 subtype A6/A1, or BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 
(Table 12). 
In patients with at least two of these risk factors, the 
proportion of subjects who had a CVF was higher than 
observed in patients with none or one risk factor, with CVF 
identified in 6/24 patients [25.0%, 95% CI (9.8%, 46.7%)] 
treated with the every 2 months dosing regimen and 5/33 
patients [15.2%, 95% CI (5.1%, 31.9%)] treated with the 
monthly dosing regimen.

REKAMBYS may be initiated with oral lead-in or without 
(direct to injection). 
The healthcare professional and patient may decide to use 
rilpivirine tablets as an oral lead-in prior to the initiation of 
REKAMBYS injections to assess tolerability (see Table 1), or 
proceed directly to REKAMBYS therapy (see Tables 2 and 3, 
for monthly and every 2 months dosing recommendations, 
respectively). […] 
Undesirable effects

[…] 
The overall safety profile at Week 96 and Week 124 in the 
FLAIR study was consistent with that observed at Week 48, 
with no new safety findings identified. In the extension 
phase of the FLAIR study, initiating the rilpivirine plus 
cabotegravir injection regimen without oral lead-in (direct 
to injection) was not associated with any new safety 
concerns related to omitting the oral lead-in phase.

Week 124 FLAIR Direct to Injection versus Oral Lead-In 
In the FLAIR study, an evaluation of safety and efficacy 
was performed at Week  124 for patients electing to switch 
at Week  100 from abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine to 
rilpivirine plus cabotegravir in the Extension Phase., 
Subjects were given the option to switch with or without an 
oral lead-in phase, creating an oral lead-in group and a 
direct to injection group.  
At Week 124, the proportion of subjects having plasma 
HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 c/mL was 1/121 (0.8%) and 1/111 (0.9%) 
for the oral lead-in and direct to injection groups, 
Page 7/9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
respectively. The rates of virologic suppression (HIV-1 RNA 
< 50 c/mL) were similar in both the oral lead-in group 
(113/121 [93.4%]) and direct to injection group (110/111 
[99.1%]).

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The initially applied indication for Verzenios is for the treatment of women with hormone receptor (HR) positive, 
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer: 
- 
- 
- 
 in combination with an aromatase inhibitor as initial endocrine-based therapy 
in combination with fulvestrant as initial endocrine-based therapy, or following endocrine therapy 
as monotherapy following disease progression after endocrine therapy and one or two chemotherapy 
regimens in the metastatic setting. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in the world and the most frequent among women. An 
estimated 1.67 million women were diagnosed with breast cancer worldwide in 2012 (representing around 25% 
of all cancers in women) and approximately 522,000 deaths were recorded (Ferlay et. al., Int J Cancer, 2012). 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Hormone receptor positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2−) breast cancer 
is frequently dependent on estrogen for survival and growth. Effects on proliferation involves stimulating 
progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle, where the cyclin-dependent kinase 
(CDK-)-4/6-retinoblastoma (pRB) axis is of central importance. 
Mechanisms for interaction between the estrogen receptor (ER) and the cyclinD-CDK4/6-pRB axis include 
ER-dependent transcriptional induction of cyclin D1, but also cyclin D1 mimicking the normal action of estrogen 
by binding the ER receptor, thus forming a positive feedback loop. The relevance of cyclin D1 in HR+ breast 
cancer is supported by its frequent overexpression, often as a consequence of genomic amplification of the 
CCND1 locus. The functionality of pRB and p16 expression (an inhibitor of the cyclin D-CDK4/6 interaction) are 
further factors of importance in this context. 
Signalling through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway also appears relevant in HR+ HER2- breast cancer. Activity can 
promote both proliferation by prevention of cyclin D1 degradation (via AKT), and growth through effects on 
metabolism and protein synthesis (via mTOR). The relevance of signalling in ER+ breast cancer is supported by 
frequent mutations in the PI3K catalytic subunit alpha. Also, amplification of FGFR1 is recurrent in HR+ HER2- 
breast cancer, with downstream signalling occurring via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and mitogen-activated protein 
kinase (MAPK) pathways. 
The mutational status of the ER receptor itself has emerged as a biological feature determining therapeutic 
efficacy in HR+ breast cancer. Although present at very low levels in endocrine-naïve tumours, mutations 
causing ligand-independent activation often develop during therapy with aromatase inhibitors. Methylation of 
Assessment report  
EMA/551438/2018 
Page 9/133 
  
  
the ER promoter and chromatin structure changes through epigenetic mechanisms can affect ER-dependent 
transcription. 
2.1.4.  Stage and prognosis 
Metastatic breast cancer is an incurable disease with a median overall survival of ~2- 3 years and a 5-year 
survival of only ~25%. The targeted population is advanced and metastatic breast cancer patients with tumours 
expressing the estrogen receptor (ER), but not the HER2-receptor. Median overall survival in this subgroup is 
better, ~2.5-4 years. Of new breast cancer cases diagnosed worldwide each year, roughly 60% to 65% are 
HR-positive, 20% to 25% are HER2-positive, and 15% to 18% are triple-negative. The expression profile of 
biological markers in breast cancer is correlated with prognosis and response to treatment, and therefore plays 
an important role in treatment decisions. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer patients derive benefit mainly from systemic treatments. In this 
setting therapy rarely has a curative intent, and patients eventually die from the disease. For the targeted 
population, a variety of endocrine therapies such as letrozole, anastrozole, exemestane, fulvestrant and 
tamoxifen are valid 1st line options. It is reasonable to consider the choice of endocrine therapy mainly a 
reflection of greater tolerability compared to chemotherapy, as there is no high-level evidence demonstrating an 
efficacy advantage. TTP/PFS in the range of 5- 15 (20) months is typical in endocrine therapy trials in the 
postmenopausal population. 
In September 2016 a first in class cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor, Ibrance (palbociclib), received a 
positive opinion from the CHMP, as an add-on to endocrine therapy. A second CDK 4/6 inhibitor, Kisqali 
(ribociclib), received a positive opinion in June 2017:

Endocrine refractoriness eventually develops. Single agent chemotherapy is preferred, as no overall survival 
benefit has been demonstrated for combinations. Anthracyclines or taxanes would usually be considered 1st line, 
if not administered in the (neo) adjuvant setting. Capecitabine and vinorelbine are options for patients that have 
received anthracyclines or taxanes, and can thus be used in the 1st or 2nd line metastatic setting. Eribulin is 
approved for breast cancer patients who have progressed after ≥1 chemotherapeutic regimen for advanced 
disease, and have previously received an anthracycline and a taxane.

2.2.  About the product 
Abemaciclib is an orally administered small-molecule inhibitor of the cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4 
and CDK6).  Abemaciclib prevents retinoblastoma protein (Rb) phosphorylation, blocking cell cycle progression 
from the G1 to the S-phase of cell division, leading to suppression of tumour growth. 
The applicant is seeking approval of abemaciclib for the following proposed indications: 
Treatment of women with hormone receptor (HR) positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) 
negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer: 
- 
- 
- 
in combination with an aromatase inhibitor as initial endocrine-based therapy 
in combination with fulvestrant as initial endocrine-based therapy, or following endocrine therapy 
as monotherapy following disease progression after endocrine therapy and one or two 
chemotherapy regimens in the metastatic setting. 
Verzenios in combination with endocrine therapy 
The recommended dose of abemaciclib is 150 mg twice daily when used in combination with endocrine therapy. 
In the Summary of Product Characteristics (section 4.2), reference is made to the SmPC of the endocrine 
therapy combination partner for a recommended posology. Women treated with the combination of abemaciclib 
plus endocrine therapy should be in a postmenopausal state prior to therapy. 
Verzenios as a single agent 
The recommended dose of abemaciclib is 200 mg twice daily. 
Verzenios should be taken continuously as long as the patient is deriving clinical benefit from therapy or until 
unacceptable toxicity occurs.

2.6.1.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of abemaciclib is 2-pyrimidinamine, 
N-[5-[(4-ethyl-1-piperazinyl)methyl]-2-pyridinyl]-5-fluoro-4-[4-fluoro-2-methyl-1-(1-methylethyl)-1H-benzi
midazol-6-yl]- corresponding to the molecular formula C27H32F2N8. It has a molecular weight of 506.59 and the 
following structure: 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
The structure of abemaciclib has been confirmed using different methods (mass spectroscopy, FTIR, 1H-NMR, 
19F-NMR, 13C-NMR, single crystal X-ray diffraction, UV and elemental analysis). All chemical, physical and 
spectroscopic data are in accordance with the structure. 
Abemaciclib contains no chiral centres. This structural feature is consistent with the observation that this 
molecule is optically inactive. Polymorphism has been observed for abemaciclib.The crystal forms have been 
thoroughly characterized (physically and chemically) by X-ray powder diffraction, solid-state C NMR 
spectroscopy, solution-state H NMR spectroscopy, polarized light microscopy, thermal analysis  and moisture 
sorption analysis. The thermodynamically most stable neat polymorph, Form III, was chosen for development. 
The current manufacturing (crystallization) process delivers Form III in highly crystalline and phase pure form.  
Abemaciclib Form III is a practically white to yellow non-hygroscopic powder, practically insoluble in water and 
sparingly soluble in ethanol. The solubility is pH dependent . and it is a tri-basic substance. The particle size has 
been identified as a critical quality attribute (CQA). 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Abemaciclib is synthesized by a convergent multiple step synthesis using commerciallyavailable well defined 
GMP starting materials with acceptable specifications. Abemaciclib is isolated after controlled crystallization to 
produce Form III and milled to produce the required particle size distribution. The synthesis and the proposed 
starting materials are accepted as concluded in Scientific Advice.  
The manufacturing process has been developed using a combination of conventional univariate studies and 
elements of QbD such as risk assessment, design of experiment (DOE) studies. Robustness of unit operations, 
process parameters and controls were evaluated against the CQAs of the active substance (namely identity, 
potency, purity, particle size) ultimately linking them to the CQAs of the finished product (identification, 
description, potency, purity, content uniformity, release profile). 
Assessment report  
EMA/551438/2018 
Page 14/133 
  
  
 
 
All steps in the synthesis are considered critical. Critical process parameters (CPPs) and their proven acceptable 
ranges (PARs) have been discussed and included in the process description.  Design spaces have been claimed 
for all steps of the synthesis as part of the manufacturing process control strategy. The available development 
data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from commercial scale batches fully support these. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
starting materials, isolated intermediates and reagents have been presented.. The characterisation of the active 
substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new active substances. 
A comprehensive evaluation of the actual and potential impurities that could be introduced via the raw material, 
starting materials, or intermediates, or that could be formed as by-products in the synthesis, or degradation 
products upon storage of the abemaciclib has been conducted. Stress testing studies were also conducted in 
order to understand the degradation and to identify potential impurities. Spiking studies were performed to 
demonstrate rejection of impurities during the synthesis. Overall, a good understanding of the source and fate 
of impurities in the process was demonstrated. 
In addition, a genotoxic impurity assessment was performed using a combination of in silico toxicity predictions, 
visual alerts, external databases and in vitro assessments. All starting materials, intermediates, reagents, as 
well as potential impurities and degradation products were taken into account for this. A detailed explanation of 
the origin, fate, purge, and control of these potentially genotoxic impurities was provided. The overall control 
strategy based on the proposed specifications for the selected starting materials, intermediates and active 
substance specifications is satisfactory. As a result of this assessment, only one genotoxic impurity is routinely 
controlled in the active substance specification. This is acceptable.   
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the clinical 
development program. Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and have been justified.   
The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is considered to be 
comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process. 
The active substance is packaged in linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) primary liner The liners may be 
placed in an appropriate container for shipping and handling. The materials of construction for the primary 
packaging component (that is, LLDPE liner) comply with the European Regulation 10/2011/EC, as amended, on 
plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with food and also meet the testing compliance 
requirements of Ph. Eur. (Section 3.1.3, Polyolefins). Specifications for LDPE liner have been provided.  
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for description (visual), identity (IR/Raman), crystal form 
(X-ray powder diffraction), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents(GC,(HPLC)-, palladium 
(ICP-OES), particle size (laser light scattering), water (KF) and residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.). 
This specification is based on the active substance CQAs: identity, potency, purity and particle size. 
Palladium will be routinely controlled in the active substance.  Particle size is a critical material attribute which 
can affect the active substance release from the dosage form and  its specification limit has been justified. The 
polymorphic form is controlled by X-ray diffraction.  The potential toxicity of abemaciclib impurities were 
evaluated as part of toxicology studies. However, given the projected dose, there are no specified impurities in 
the abemaciclib active substance above the ICH qualification threshold.  
Assessment report  
EMA/551438/2018 
Page 15/133 
  
  
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by toxicological 
and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
A specification for the identified genotoxic impurity has been included. The limit is based on the toxicologically 
acceptable levels of the impurity at the projected dose. Solvents used in the process are controlled based on the 
requirements of ICH Q3C (R5) guideline or toxicologically justified. The omission of testing of elemental 
impurities, loss on drying and microbial purity has been satisfactorily addressed.  
An elemental impurities risk assessment was conducted on abemaciclib following the principles outlined in ICH 
Q3D.  Absence of microbial purity test has been justified  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for identity, assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from multiple batches of the active substance are provided.. The results are within the 
specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from three batches of active substance manufactured at commercial scale by a process 
representative of the commercial process stored for up to 24 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% 
RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided. These batches were packed in a pack equivalent of the commercial container The following parameters 
were tested: description, package characteristics, identity, assay, impurities, crystal form, and water content. 
Particle size distribution and surface area were also monitored The analytical methods used were generally the 
same as for release and werestability indicatingSamples were stored under both long term (up to 36 months) 
and accelerated conditions (6 months). These batches were tested for physical appearance, package 
characteristics, assay, impurities and crystal form. One batch was also tested for water content and particle size 
distributionThe active substance was shown to be stable. 
All tested parameters remained within the specification and no trends were observed. No increase in impurities 
or loss of potency was observed and there was no change in physical properties throughout the duration of these 
studies. 
Stress testing studies were also conducted in order to gain an understanding of abemaciclib degradation 
chemistry. Active substance in solid state was exposed to heat/humidity and light (as per ICH Q1B). Active 
substance in solution and suspension was exposed to a wide range of pH conditions at elevated temperatures, 
light, and oxidative conditions. Samples were assayed for abemaciclib content and impurities.  Abemaciclib 
active substance in solid state did not exhibit any detectable degradation under the stress conditions of heat and 
humidity during the period tested. These results conclude that abemaciclib would be chemically stable when 
stored at ambient temperature and humidity. In addition, the photostability study showed no significant 
degradation in solid state samples exposed to simulated sunlight. These results indicate that abemaciclib would 
also be stable when the active substance is exposed to normal ambient lighting conditions. 
Solutions of abemaciclib did not exhibit significant degradation across the pH range indicating that abemaciclib 
is not susceptible to hydrolysis.  Solutions of abemaciclib in oxidative conditions underwent significant 
degradation, indicating that abemaciclib is susceptible to oxidative conditions in solution. The abemaciclib 
solutions containing trace metals did not undergo any degradation indicating that abemaciclib is not susceptible 
Assessment report  
EMA/551438/2018 
Page 16/133 
  
  
to trace metal catalysed degradation. Significant degradation of abemaciclib was observed in all of the 
light-exposed solutions. The rate of photodegradation was pH dependent with the slowest photodegradation 
occurring at low pH. 
The conclusion from the long-term, accelerated and stress degradation stability studies is that abemaciclib 
active substance would be chemically stable when stored at ambient temperature and humidity. The results also 
indicate that abemaciclib would be stable when the active substance is exposed to normal ambient lighting 
conditions. Therefore, the stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months in the proposed 
container without any special storage condition. 
2.6.2.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product consists of oval immediate release film-coated tablets containing 50 mg, 100 mg or 150 mg 
of abemaciclib as active substance. As mentioned above, tablets containing 200 mg were also developed but 
were withdrawn by the applicant during the evaluation procedure. The dose strengths are differentiated by size, 
weight, debossment, and colour as depicted in Table 2.

As indicated above, several crystalline forms of abemaciclib free base were observed during a comprehensive 
polymorph screening. Crystalline Form III is non-hygroscopic and is thermo-dynamically more stable than the 
other neat crystal forms, solvates and hydrates and was chosen for commercialization. The crystalline Form III 
of abemaciclib was used in all the clinical studies. Potential for phase transformation of abemaciclibwas 
evaluated during formulation development and ruled out.Abemaciclib crystalline Form III is highly soluble; the 
highest dose strength (200 mg) is soluble in less than 250 mL across the pH range 1 to 6.8. In vitro studies 
indicated that abemaciclib has moderate permeability. Therefore, abemaciclib was considered by the applicant 
a Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) 3 molecule. In silico modeling suggested that the absorption of 
abemaciclib is not solubility/dissolution limited and is independent of particle size over a wide 
range.Nonetheless, an acceptance criterion for particle size was set using the x90 parameter to mitigate any 
residual risk to absorption. In addition, pharmacokinetic analysis of data from studies showed that the 
Assessment report

absorption of abemaciclib is not formulation dependent (not solubility/dissolution-limited) and is independent of 
active substance particle size within the sizes that were used in the clinical studies. 
All excipients are compendial and comply with Ph. Eur., except the colour mixtures which are composed of 
compendial ingredients, and Iron Oxide Yellow and Iron Oxide Red which comply with Commission Regulations 
(EU) No. 231/2012. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The excipient levels 
chosen for the finished product are within typical ranges for solid oral dosage forms. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. and comprise microcrystalline cellulose (diluent), lactose monohydrate 
(diluent), croscarmellose sodium (disintegrant), silica colloidal hydrated (glidant), sodium stearyl fumarate 
(lubricant), polyvinyl alcohol (film-forming polymer), titanium dioxide (pigment/opacifier), macrogol 
(plasticizer/detackifier), talc (detackifier),  and iron oxides (pigments).  
Additional studies demonstrating the excipient selection and robustness for the levels of the selected excipients 
and their material attributes that could have impact on drug product CQAs have been presented.  
In addition, the applicant discussed the functionality related characteristics of the active substance and 
excipients that may have an impact on the finished product manufacturability  and provided details how the 
potential variability in these are eventually managed within the control strategy. In this regard, additional tests 
for relevant excipients have been presented.Based on the development studies presented the proposed 
specifications are considered sufficient for the continuous manufacturing process. 
The goal of the pharmaceutical development efforts was directed to the production of a stable, bioavailable 
dosage form with consistent product performance attributes throughout its shelf life. Quality by Design (QbD) 
principles including risk assessments were used to ensure all desired quality attributes were addressed in the 
commercial abemaciclib tablets. 
The formulation development activities, including the selection of excipients, their levels, and drug 
concentration were based on development experiments as well as previous experiences with similar materials.  
To support Phase 1 and non-pivotal Phase 2 clinical studies, a drug-in-capsule formulation (C1 formulation) was 
developed. A formulated capsule (C2 formulation) was subsequentlty developed providing dose strengths 
ranging from 50 to 200 mg. Changes to the C2 formulation and process were made to improve manufacturing 
robustness, specifically to improve flow of the final blend and to provide better filled capsule weight control. This 
led to the C3 capsule formulation and process in which the active substance concentration was decreased . The 
C3 capsule formulation and process were used to manufacture all pivotal clinical study supplies.A tablet dosage 
form (T1, the proposed commercial formulation) was developed to minimize the size and the number of dosage 
units the patient would be required to take relative to the capsule dosage form To achieve these objectives, it 
was essential to maximize the active substance concentration in the formulation while maintaining acceptable 
CQAs. Thus, the tablet formulationutilizes a proportionally similar formulation to provide 50-, 100-, 150-, and 
200-mg strengths by varying tablet weight and size. Each of the materials in the unit formula was selected to 
address the risks associated with identified factors. Development studies demonstrated that thechosen active 
substance concentration resulted in robust product and process performance.An initial formulation risk 
assessment was completed to assess the potential impact of material characteristics on finished product CQAs: 
description, identification, potency, purity, content uniformity, and release. No high risks were identified. This 
initial risk assessment was used to focus development on those areas with the potential of negatively impacting 
a finished product CQA. All of the medium risk items were investigated during development to provide a better 
understanding of their potential impact to product performance and develop an appropriate control strategy if 
needed.   
Assessment report  
EMA/551438/2018

Abemaciclib tablets are manufactured via a continuous direct compression process. Commercial formulation 
development commenced with studies to help inform the initial process risk assessment and assess the impact 
on drug product CQAs. The goal of these was to evaluate the robustness of the formulation. The results 
demonstrated the robustness of the formulation. 
A bioequivalence study comparing the abemaciclib tablet formulations (50 mg and 150 mg) to the C3 capsule 
was performed. The 50 mg C3 capsule used in pivotal clinical trials was determined to be bioequivalent to the 50 
mg and 150 mg T1 tablets (I3Y-MC-JPCC). The T1 tablet formulation and process used to manufacture the 
bioequivalence study batches are identical to those used to manufacture the tablet primary stability batches and 
are the intended commercial formulation and process.  
A biowaiver for the 100 mg and 200 mg tablets was requested in line with the CHMP guideline on the 
investigation of bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/Corr). The 150 mg strength tablet was chosen 
as the reference because it is the highest strength tablet in the bioequivalence study. All tablet strength batches 
were manufactured at a scale that is at least 100,000 units or 1/10th the intended commercial scale (whichever 
is larger) and utilized the intended commercial manufacturing process. The results indicated that the dissolution 
characteristics of the finished product are not dependent on the product strength. 
The choice of the dissolution method proposed for quality control (QC) has been thoroughly explained and 
justified. The dissolution method development was conducted with a goal of identifying method conditions that 
allowed complete recovery of the drug from the tablet while maintaining an appropriate degree of 
discrimination. In an attempt to obtain discriminating method conditions, different media additives, such as 
salts and surfactants, were evaluated. Based on the results obtained, the medium for the tablet QC dissolution 
method was selected, since this method is as discriminating as any of the methods that have shown adequate 
recovery. The selected media is commonly applied for highly soluble immediate release drug products and 
represents the dissolution of the finished product in the gastric pH environment. This method has been applied 
as the clinical trial material control method throughout the development of the tablets. 
The use of the selected media for control of the commercial drug product is considered justified. 
The manufacturing process development followed Quality by Design (QbD) principles. As indicated above, a 
continuous direct compression manufacturing process was selected for the manufacture of the commercial 
tablets. The manufacturing process consists of a pre-blend, loss in weight feeding of the pre-blend and other 
individual components, continuous powder mixing and tablet compression. Core tablets manufactured from this 
continuous process are then film-coated in a traditional batch process.  
Each loss in weight (LIW) feeder uses active process control where process parameters (for example, screw 
speed) are automatically adjusted in response to common-cause and special-cause variability in order to 
maintain its actual mass flow rate near its set point. In addition to the local feeder controls, the feeding 
operation also has a system level control which makes all the feeders work together to ensure the unit formula 
is fed. 
Process parameters were assessed using a Failure Mode, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) risk 
assessment tool based on internal experience, first principles understanding, published literature and/or input 
from subject matter experts. Parameters ranked as medium or high risk were studied further and discussed.Site 
transfers during development and to commercial site have been adequately described. The results from this 
study were used to establish PARs as well as material attribute ranges. These are supported by the development 
data and controls in place. During the evaluation, the applicant confirmed that the process will be run at target 
parameters and no design space is claimed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/551438/2018 
Page 19/133 
  
  
System modeling was completed to determine the continuous manufacturing system dynamics (for example, 
mixing capacity and particle residence time distribution (RTD), amplitude of the deviation in the feeding of one 
component and duration of the deviation). The Applicant has adequately described the investigations led to 
determine product RTD within the system. He has also explained how the limits established for all the feeders 
combined with the allowable mass flow rates and the mixer filtering capacity, are capable of dissipating any 
perturbation during process run and monitoring the state of control of the feeding operation. 
In addition, in order to ensure the state of control of the process, the Applicant has developed a proactive control 
strategy and uses different elements  to monitor and control the process performance and product quality. The 
data collected from the monitoring strategy are used as part of the control strategy to ensure that core tablet 
collection only occurs when all of the product collection criteria are met. RTD knowledge was used to define the 
amount of material that must be segregated due to the degree of intermixing that can occur from the point of 
detection to the point of segregation. This was defined such that all potential non-conforming material is 
removed from the process with high confidence.  
The control strategy for each step of the continuous manufacturing has been properly detailed in terms of 
controls (for each step, for each equipment and control loops linked), alarms and material traceability. 
A feed frame near infrared (FF NIR) method was developed to provide a prediction of the active substance 
concentration in the powder blend at the tablet press feed frame. The development followed a science and risk 
based approach, including risk assessments and design of experiment (DOE) studies to determine which 
variables may impact the NIR measurement. The description of the method is in line with Ph. Eur. monograph 
2.2.40 and CHMP Note for guidance “Guideline on the use of Near Infrared Spectroscopy by the Pharmaceutical 
industry and the data requirements for new submissions and variations” (EMEA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/17760/2009 
Rev2). Details on the NIR instrument, software and fiber optic probe are provided, along with development and 
calibration information have been provided. Validation of the chemometric models has also been conducted and 
procedures for life-cycle maintenance have been presented in line with the CHMP guideline. 
The primary packaging is PCTFE/PE/PVC blisters sealed with an aluminium foil or aluminium/aluminium 
perforated unit dose blisters. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the 
container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the 
product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of five main steps: pre-blending, feeding of the raw materials, continuous 
mixing and direct compression, and film-coating. Core tablets manufactured from this continuous process are 
then coated in a traditional batch tablet coating process.  
In-process hold times have been defined and validated. 
The batch formula has been adequately justified.As described above, the PAT applications are used for active 
substance concentration prediction in the in-line tablet press feed frame.  
The bulk tablets are packaged in a monolayer low density polyethylene (LDPE) primary liner which contains no 
additives. The LDPE liner is placed in a secondary laminated foil liner. Each liner is independently cable tied or 
equivalent. The liners may be placed in an appropriate container such as a corrugated container, fiber drum, 
polyethylene drum, or metal drum for shipping and handling. It is stated that the materials of construction for 
the primary packaging component (that is, LDPE liner) comply with the European Regulation 10/2011/EC, as

amended, on plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with food and also meet the testing 
compliance requirements of the European Pharmacopoeia (Section 3.1.3, Polyolefins). 
Process validation data from three consecutive batches for each strength from various batch sizes, including the 
maximum initial commercial batch size for each strength have been provided. All results are well within 
acceptance criteria. The validation was comprehensive and comprised relevant parameters and acceptance 
criteria and the results indicate that the manufacturing process is under control and is capable of producing the 
finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type 
of manufacturing process. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: description 
(visual), identity (IR), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (RTRT/HPLC), 
dissolution (UV), dye-identity (chemical). 
The product specifications cover appropriate parameters for this dosage form. 
The applicant’s batch release strategy comprises real time release testing (RTRT) for content uniformity and 
traditional batch release strategy for other finished product CQAs.  
UDU will be controlled by RTRT and it will comply if tested by HPLC. The HPLC will not routinely be performed. 
It will only be conducted as part of the NIR method model monitoring and maintenance strategy in batches 
which have been prospectively identified. Comparative results for process validation commercial scale batches 
usingthe NIR control strategy, plus a stratified sampling of tablets tested with the regulatory release method 
(HPLC, Ph. Eur. 2.9.40), were provided to support this. In addition, the Applicant proposes to continue parallel 
testing in order to ensure robustness of the system during the first year of commercial production on at least one 
batch per manufacturing campaign, and after at a minimum of not less than one batch annually. 
The finished product batch analysis data together with risk assessment conducted in line with ICH Q3D supports 
the conclusion to not perform routine analysis of elemental impurities in the finished product. 
Justification for not including test for moisture, microbial testing and crystal form were also provided based on 
the data obtained in the stability studies.The finished product is manufactured using a dry direct compression 
continuous manufacturing process.  
One batch per strength of finished product per year is analyzed at release for microbiological purity. The 
analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH 
guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for identity, assay and impurities 
testing has been presented. 
In-house analytical procedures are well described and validated in agreement with ICH guidelines and regional 
guidelines (i.e. NIR). 
Batch analysis data for three commercial scale batches of each strength manufactured for commercial 
distribution at the commercial manufacturing site are provided(in total 12 batches). All batches comply with 
specification and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the 
intended product specification.  
Batch data for three technical transfer batches (one batch of each strength), 12 primary stability batches (three 
batches of each strength ) manufactured at the lower commercial scale using the commercial process, and 
Assessment report  
EMA/551438/2018 
Page 21/133 
  
  
supporting batch data for the clinical trial capsule formulation were also provided. All batches complied with the 
specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three production scale batches of finished product of each strength stored for up to 12 
months under long term conditions (30 ºC / 65% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 
ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The stability batches are representative of the 
proposed commercial manufacturing site, processed at target process conditions.The batches of were packed in 
the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for description (visual), package characteristics (visual), assay (HPLC), degradation 
products (HPLC), dissolution, water activity, crystal form (XRPD USP), TAMC, TYMC and specified organisms (E. 
coli and Salmonella) (Ph. Eur.). The analytical procedures used are stability indicating.  
A matrixing design is used with a “one third reduction” on the 3-, 6-, 9-, and 18-month time points for three 
batches of each strength whereas all batches are tested at 12, 24, and 36 months.  
No significant change or trends are observed up to 12 months and all results complied with the specification. No 
degradation products were observed above the 0.05% reporting threshold up to 12 months.  
Supporting stability data from two clinical trial batches of abemaciclib tablets (50 and 150 mg) manufactured by 
a process representative of the commercial process were presented in an alternative packaging (container not 
claimed for marketing) and placed on stability at 30ºC/65% RH and at 40ºC/75% RH. Stability data are available 
up to 12 months for long-term storage and for up to 6 months accelerated storage conditions. No significant 
physical or chemical changes have been observed for the product, and these data further support a 24 month 
shelf-life for the abemaciclib commercial tablets. 
Thermal/humidity stress testing was also conducted in order to gain understanding of degradation chemistry 
and to help identify potential degradation of abemaciclib tablets. Open-dish thermal/humidity stress stability 
studies were performed on one batch of each tablet strength manufactured by a process representative of the 
commercial processshowing no degradationAt levated temperatures a small total degradation increase was 
identified.  
A photostability study was performed on one batch of each tablet strength in line with ICH Q1B. It showed no 
significant change in chemical or physical stability of the tablets as a result of the direct exposure to simulated 
sunlight conditions. Therefore, the finished product is considered photo stable. 
Stability data of the bulk tablet have been provided at 5°C, 30°C/75% RH and 40°C/75% RH for the primary 
stability batches for each tablet strength. All the results in terms of assay, degradation products, description, 
package characteristics water activity, dissolution, crystal form,microbial quality complied with the acceptance 
criteria. Based on bulk hold studies for tablets a storage period of 18 months can be acceptable under the 
storage conditions of 5 to 30°C. Conditions of shipment have also defined, i.e. temperature should not exceed 
30°C. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of two years without any special storage conditions as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable.

It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those used 
to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of ruminant 
material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal 
Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products. 
2.6.3.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner.  
Both developments for the active substance and finished product have followed QbD principles (risk 
assessments, design of experiments, establishment of ranges for process parameters, etc.) and detailed 
information has been provided. Design spaces have been claimed for the manufacturing process of the active 
substance. The tablets are manufactured via continuous mixing and direct compression. The applicant has 
conducted extensive studies to define the formulation and manufacturing process. An important knowledge of 
the product/process was gained through a data-rich environment which enables a performance based approach 
with focus on control of unit operation outputs. A proactive control strategy which gives the opportunity to react 
to perturbations (PAT tools, integrated controls and close process monitoring-forward control loops, real time 
handling of disturbances, segregation points to divert non-conforming material) has been established. The 
finished product specification comprises RTRT for content uniformity, and traditional batch release strategy for 
other finished product CQAs. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important 
product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give reassurance on 
viral/TSE safety. 
2.7.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.7.1.  Pharmacology 
The active substance of Verzenios is abemaciclib. It is a small molecular weight molecule with the chemical 
formula C27H32F2N8 and the molecular weight of 506.59g/mol. 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The pharmacological cellular mechanism of abemaciclib involves the inhibition of protein kinase activated cell 
proliferation in the G1 phase of the cell cycle.  
Assessment report  
EMA/551438/2018 
Page 23/133 
  
  
The molecular mechanism of action of abemaciclib is based on the ATP-competitive inhibitory or preventive 
binding to human Cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4 and CDK6), thereby reducing the probability of their 
binding to Cyclin D1 and the subsequent CDK4/CDK6-dependent phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein 
(p-Rb; evaluated on serine sites 780, 807, or 811). 
 The molecular specificity of abemaciclib for CDK4 and CDK6 was estimated using cell-free kinase assays 
(IC50<10nM, see table below). The in-vitro cellular effect concentration for abemaciclib was measured in cell 
inhibition assays, giving an IC50 range between 210 and 450nM depending on cell line (e.g. A549 cells, Colo205 
cells). The IC50 concentrations to alter p-Rb expression were between 151 and 180nM. Abemaciclib is known to 
have a number of human relevant metabolites (M1, M2, M18, M20, M21 and M22) whereof some (M2, M18, 
M20) also have similar levels of molecular affinity for the target molecules (see table below) and M2 and M20 are 
at >10% in humans.

The effective concentrations of abemaciclib and its metabolites differed in some cases between cancer cell lines 
and depending on endpoint (e.g. molecular biomarker express, cell inhibition). The Cell inhibitory IC50 difference 
between abemaciclib and its primary metabolites can range between 0.3x and 1.1x (M2) and between 0.6x and 
1.4x (M20) between different breast cancer cell lines. For M18, there was an up to 11.5x margin for in effective 
concentration regarding changes in biomarker expression between cell lines. Overall, while abemaciclib itself 
seems relatively similar in its impact on different biochemical and in-vitro test systems, its metabolites seem to 
demonstrate a greater effect variation in in-vitro test systems. Reduced Rb-expression allows for abemaciclib 
resistance generation in cancer cell lines. 
In a set of xenograft rodent model animals (based on injections of cancer cell lines or tumour fragment 
xenografts into the hind leg or back of the animals), abemaciclib was weakly to moderately effective as a 
treatment around 40-50 mg/kg (mostly stable disease to partial response, with tumour growth reduction but not 
tumour regression) and more clearly effective between 75-90 mg/kg (generating partial to complete response 
with tumour regression in some cases). One orthotopic xenograft study with glioblastoma cells showed that 
abemaciclib can be effective in neural cells. Whether a damaged blood brain barrier is a prerequisite is unknown. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
While the applicant has not provided any dedicated secondary pharmacodynamics studies, data on a set of 
kinases is present as in-vitro primary pharmacodynamics data. Out of the kinases screened, abemaciclib had a 
moderate inhibitory effect on a set of eight kinases at 6nM ≤ IC50 < 300nM (IC50 ranking PIM1 < HIPK2 < 
CDK9/Cyclin T1 < DYRK2 < PIM2 < CK2 < GSK3b < CDK5/P35). The PIM1 kinase has IC50 of 6nM, i.e. one the 
same level as CDK4 and CDK6, and CDK9 and HIPK2 have IC50s of ≤~33nM. Follow up studies on CDK9 
downstream targets p-CTD and MCL1 indicate that any potential binding CDK9 does not seem to have any 
downstream effects in-vitro. The inclusion of an additional receptor interaction study spanning 23 receptor and 
transporter proteins, it was found that the H2 and M2 receptors were the most potent binding targets with IC50 
at 852 and 913nM respectively. This indicates a weak inhibition potential (i.e. IC50 300-1000nM) and is above 
the clinical Cmax (123ng/mL, which gives a total concentration of 242.79nM and a free unbound fraction 
concentration between 7.28nM and 12.14nM at 95-97% plasma protein binding).  
Assessment report  
EMA/551438/2018 
Page 24/133 
  
  
Safety pharmacology programme 
Abemaciclib demonstrated a statistically significant inhibition at 1.65μM (-33.7%) in a hERG assay giving an 
IC50>1.65uM (no higher concentrations were tested due to solubility issues). Based on a reported human Cmax 
of 123ng/mL, this gives a conservative estimated concentration of 242.8nM and a free concentration (at 
95-97% plasma protein bound) of abemaciclib in humans between 7.3nM and 12.1nM and a hERG/Cmax ratio 
at 95% protein binding of 136. The main metabolite (M2, M18 and M20) hERG affinities were weaker (>10uM) 
than the parent compound.  The standard core in-vivo Safety pharmacology (CNS, cardiovascular and 
respiration) studies have been conducted in rat (CNS, respiratory) and dog (cardiovascular). All studies used 
single-dose oral gavage and were GLP. Overall, no test article linked mortality or adverse clinical signs were 
observed with the exception in the dog study where one max-dose (10mg/kg) animal (out of eight) manifested 
post-dose paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia. There was also minor but statistically significant decrease 
(~1-3%) in the QT interval was seen at 1 and 10mg/kg. No similar findings were reported from the clinical safety 
data. The cause of the ventricular tachycardia remains unclear but is suggested that it is likely due to irritation 
originating from the insertion site of the left ventricular pressure transducer and/or positive ECG electrode. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Treatment of xenograft mouse models with combinations of abemaciclib (dose range 50-75mg/kg, oral gavage) 
and fulvestrant (5mg/kg) alternatively tamoxifen (0.1mg/kg) did potentiate the abemaciclib effect in the breast 
cancer relevant xenograft mouse models (although the extent of the effects were xenograft specific). There are 
some indications that the combination treatments may generate a more durable growth inhibition in the 
post-dose period. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Method validation: Plasma samples from GLP repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs were analysed for 
abemaciclib and its main metabolites in humans LSN2839567 (M2), LSN3106726 (M20) and LSN3106729 (M18) 
using validated LC-MS/MS methods. In the pharmacokinetic distribution, metabolism and elimination studies, 
14C-abemaciclib was used together with liquid scintillation spectrometry. A single 14C label was placed on the 
carbon bearing the methyl substituent of the benzimidazole group. The radiochemical purity was 98.8% and the 
largest individual impurity was <0.5%.  Metabolite structural elucidation was carried out using LC-MS or 
LC-MS/MS. The bioanalytical methods are considered adequate.  
Absorption: In single dose PK studies, abemaciclib was slowly absorbed and the oral bioavailability was 
estimated to be moderate to high in rats (~30-60%) and high (~84-85%) in dogs. In this respect, the rat is 
more similar to humans (45% bioavailability after single oral dose of 200mg). The Tmax in rats and dogs 
(6.67-8h) was similar to that in humans (8h). Dose-proportionality after single dose administration was 
evaluated in rats (one oral gavage and one 4h i.v. infusion study). With oral exposure, the Cmax increase was 
less than dose-proportional (AUC0-t could not be evaluated due to inadequate duration of plasma sampling). 
With i.v. exposure, the increase in AUC0-∞ was approximately dose proportional with similar clearance values 
across doses whereas the Cmax was less than dose-proportional. The volume of distribution and half-life 
increased as the dose increased, particularly at high doses of 40 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg.  
Distribution: Tissue distribution in albino and pigmented rats was evaluated by quantitative whole body 
autoradiography (QWBA). After a single oral dose (10mg/kg), abemaciclib was strongly distributed to 
pigmented tissues/organs (eyes in particular), with a long elimination phase (half-life > 400 h). The top 
Assessment report  
EMA/551438/2018 
Page 25/133 
  
  
 
distribution organs/tissues in rat besides the eyes were the skin (pigmented and non-pigmented), meninges, 
several glands (preputial gland, harderian gland, intra-orbital lacrimal gland, exorbital lacrimal gland, adrenal 
gland cortex and medulla), spleen, liver and kidneys.  
Given the lack of eye or skin toxicity in the non-clinical studies (see Toxicology) or in the clinic (see Clinical part), 
the preferential distribution of abemaciclib to eye and skin does not appear to be associated with any obvious 
risk for toxicity in patients. An in vivo phototoxicity study in rats gave negative results (see Toxicology).  
Reproductive organs (bulbo-urethral gland, prostate gland, epididymis, testes, ovaries and uterus) had also 
moderate to high levels of radioactivity. The distribution to the testes indicates that drug-derived radioactivity of 
abemaciclib crosses the blood-testis barrier to a certain extent. Radioactivity was also weak to moderate in 
blood-brain barrier protected tissues (cerebellum, cerebrum, medulla, and spinal cord) and very high in 
non-protected tissues (choroid plexus). Radioactivity in the CNS was detectable up to 12 to 24 hours post 
dosing.  
Abemaciclib was highly bound to plasma proteins in rat, dog and human (~95-99%). The metabolites M2 and 
M20 had a somewhat lower binding (M2: ~83-92%; M20: ~76-94%) with the lowest bindings to dog plasma 
proteins (M2: 83%; M20: 76%). Distribution over the placenta or into milk has not been studied.  
Metabolism: 
In vitro; the in vitro metabolism of abemaciclib was evaluated in hepatocytes and liver microsomes of rat, dog 
and human. The metabolic turnover in hepatocytes was low in rat and dog when compared to human. 
Qualitatively, in vitro metabolism in hepatocytes was consistent among species and produced the same 4 four 
oxidative metabolites: LSN2878851 (M1), LSN2839567 (M2), LSN3106726 (M20) and a fourth metabolite 
whose structure has not been fully established.  
In vivo; abemaciclib underwent extensive metabolism in vivo in rat, dog and human. The major component in 
plasma of all three species was unchanged abemaciclib. The most prominent (active and major) plasma 
metabolites in human were M20 and M2. Exposure to these metabolites was evaluated in rat and dog 
repeat-dose toxicity studies (see Toxicology section). All metabolites identified in human feces, the predominant 
elimination route for abemaciclib and its metabolites, were also detected in dog feces. The major elimination 
pathway, N-desethylation to form metabolite M2, was consistent in rat, dog, and human.  
Excretion: Mass balance data was obtained from rats and male Beagle dogs. Overall, the results indicate that 
elimination pathways for abemaciclib in rats and dogs were similar (i.e. N-desethylation to form metabolite 
LSN2839567/M2); the majority of absorbed drug-related radioactivity being eliminated by metabolism via bile, 
or by direct secretion into faeces. A similar excretion profile has been observed in humans.  
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions: For discussion, see the Pharmacokinetics section. 
2.7.2.  Toxicology 
The toxicological profile of abemaciclib has been evaluated in agreement with recommendations in ICH S9. The 
performed studies comprise repeat-dose toxicity studies for up to 3 months in rats and dogs, in vitro and in vivo 
genotoxicity, embryo-foetal development toxicity in rats, and in vivo phototoxicity. In addition, two major 
human metabolites (M2, M20) were evaluated in a standard package of genotoxicity studies.  
Assessment report  
EMA/551438/2018 
Page 26/133 
  
  
Rats and dogs were used for toxicity studies based on the expression of target and similarity of metabolism to 
humans. Based on demonstration of target-related findings, both species are considered to be 
pharmacologically relevant. 
Single dose toxicity 
No dedicated single-dose toxicity studies were conducted, which is acceptable. Rats tolerated a single dose of 
300 mg/kg/bw in the in vivo micronucleus study. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Mortality  
In the 1-month rat study, two satellite rats administered 50 mg/kg/day were euthanized or died on Days 20 and 
14, respectively. Clinical signs preceding death were decreased activity, dehydration, reduced appetite, soft or 
reduced feces, and decreased body weight. In the 3-month rat study, one satellite rat administered 30 
mg/kg/day was found dead on Day 73, having lost 42 g during the last body weight collection interval. Intestinal 
toxicity (see further below) is considered to be the main cause of death in these rats.  
In the 1-month dog study, one male and one female dog at 10 mg/kg/day were pre-terminally euthanized on 
Days 12 and 15, respectively, due to poor health condition. Clinical signs included decreased activity, tremor, 
suspected dehydration, thinness, weakness, liquid faeces and vomiting. Both dogs had lost weight, due to 
decreased food consumption. Intestinal lesions (villous/mucosal atrophy, cryptal necrosis, and haemorrhage) 
were the main cause of the deteriorating condition, with severe hematopoietic hypocellularity of the bone 
marrow contributing to the morbidity. 
Clinical signs, body weight and food consumption 
Rats treated at > 30 mg/kg/day for 1 month showed salivation, wet fur, dried/flaking/red/scabbed skin, fur 
effects (thin, alopecia), prominent backbone, dehydration, decreased activity and hypersensitivity. At > 10 
mg/kg/day, food consumption, mean body weight and body weight gain were decreased. In the 3-month rat 
study, there were no clinical signs up to 30 mg/kg/day, although food consumption was decreased at 30 
mg/kg/day and mean body weight and body weight gain were decreased at > 3 mg/kg/day.  
Dogs treated at 10 mg/kg/day for 1 month showed the same clinical signs as the preterminally euthanized dogs 
(see under Mortality). Soft/liquid faeces and decreased food consumption were observed at > 1 mg/kg/day. 
Decreased body weight and body weight gain occurred mainly at 10 mg/kg/day. In the 3-month study, slightly 
decreased body weight and body weight gain were observed in females at > 0.3 mg/kg/day, associated with 
lower food consumption and prominent backbone at > 1 mg/kg/day.  
The majority of clinical signs, and effects on body weight in rats and dogs, are considered due to the intestinal 
lesions caused by abemaciclib administration (see below).  
Effects on the small and large intestine 
Minimal to moderate crypt hyperplasia, epithelial degeneration/atrophy and neutrophilic inflammation were 
observed in the small and large intestine of rats treated at > 30 mg/kg/day for 1 month. These findings were 
associated with hematological effects: increased white blood cells, neutrophils and lymphocytes. Decreases in 
serum total protein, albumin, globulin and calcium at > 10 mg/kg/day reflected loss via the intestinal wall. It can 
Assessment report  
EMA/551438/2018 
Page 27/133 
  
  
be noted that in all sections and at all doses, the architecture of each respective intestinal segment was 
maintained, the epithelium was intact (absence of obvious erosion/ulceration of the mucosa), and active 
appropriate regeneration was occurring within the crypt (hyperplasia: crypt). Minimal to mild crypt hyperplasia 
was present in the duodenum of rats treated at > 10 mg/kg/day for 3 months, with associated decreased serum 
total protein, albumin, globulin and calcium.  
Dogs administered 10 mg/kg/day for 1 month showed minimal to marked villous/mucosal atrophy (duodenum, 
jejunum, ileum), minimal to moderate crypt hyperplasia (duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, colon), minimal to 
slight crypt necrosis (jejunum, colon), slight subacute inflammation (ileum, cecum) and minimal to marked 
hemorrhage (duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colon). No intestinal effects were observed in the 3-month study, 
using doses up to 3 mg/kg/day. 
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and decreased appetite are common adverse events in clinical 
trials with abeciclib. The proposed SmPC contains information concerning this risk in section 4.8.  
Effects on the bone marrow and lymphoid system 
In all rat and dog studies, bone marrow hypocellularity and lymphoid depletion in the thymus (associated with 
small thymus and decreased thymus weight) were observed, at doses > 10 mg/kg/day (rat) and > 0.3 mg/kg/day 
(dog). In rats, there was an additional finding in the thymus in form of medullary hypercellularity. Correlating 
hematological changes in rats and dogs were seen with decreases in myeloid: erythroid ratio (dog), reticulocyte 
count, red blood cell count, hemoglobin and  haematocrit, as well as decreases in lymphocytes, neutrophils, 
monocytes, platelets and eosinophils. In the 3-month rat study, increased MCV, MCH and RDW were also 
observed, at > 3 mg/kg/day. Rats treated at > 10 mg/kg/day for 3 months showed decreased APTT, which may 
have been related to the bone marrow cytotoxicity.  
At higher doses (> 30 mg/kg/day in rats, > 3 mg/kg/day in dogs) decreased lymphoid follicles and germinal 
centers were seen in lymph nodes and the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). In rats, paracortical 
hypercellularity was noted in parallel with the decreased lymphoid cellularity in the B-cell areas. In dogs, there 
was decreased lymphoid cellularity affecting both follicular (B-cell) and paracortical (T-cell) areas.   
Anemia and decreased white blood cells have been reported in clinical trials with abemaciclib. ‘Severe infection 
secondary to neutropenia’ is included as an important identified risk in the RMP. The proposed SmPC contains 
information and warnings concerning this risk in sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8. From a non-clinical perspective, no 
further action is considered necessary. 
Effects on the male reproductive system 
In rats treated at > 10 mg/kg/day for 1 month, decreased testis weight and testicular degeneration/depletion of 
germ cells, associated with spermatid retention, were observed. Additional male reproductive organ findings 
included intratubular cellular debris in the epididymis and decreased epididymis weight, decreased prostate 
weight and prostate atrophy, and seminal vesicle atrophy. The testicular effects are considered due to the 
pharmacological effect of abemaciclib on dividing cells (mitotic spermatogonia and meiotic spermatocytes), 
resulting in abnormal spermatogenesis. The atrophy observed in the prostate gland and seminal vesicle is 
considered to be secondary to the testicular toxicity. In the 3-month rat study no male reproductive toxicity was 
observed, despite similar exposure at 10 mg/kg/day as in the 1-month study. The reason for this discrepancy is 
not clear.  
In dogs, slight seminiferous tubule degeneration with minimal hypo/aspermatogenesis in the testis, and 
corresponding oligo/aspermia in the epididymis, was observed at > 3 mg/kg/day in the 1-month study. These 
Assessment report  
EMA/551438/2018 
Page 28/133 
  
  
effects became more pronounced in the 3-month study, where decreased testis weight correlating with minimal 
to severe seminiferous tubule degeneration/necrosis, and epididymal cellular debris, occurred at > 0.3 
mg/kg/day. Marked to severe oligo/aspermia was present at 3 mg/kg/day. 
The LOAEL for testicular toxicity in dogs was below the intended clinical AUC exposure. Based on the observed 
testis toxicity, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with abemaciclib. This information is included in 
section 4.6 of the SmPC. From a non-clinical point of view, no further action is needed. 
Effects on the kidney 
Rats administered abemaciclib at > 30 mg/kg/day for 1 month showed minimal to slight 
vacuolation/degeneration of collecting ducts. Tubular basophilia was observed in males after recovery, 
suggesting regeneration. In the 3-month study, rats treated at 30 mg/kg/day showed mild glomerular changes, 
increased incidence of minimal to moderate tubular degeneration/regeneration, tubular pigmentation and 
minimal medullary necrosis. These findings were accompanied by increased urea and creatinine in males, as 
well as decreased urinary volume, increased urine specific gravity and lower pH in males. No renal effects were 
observed in dogs. 
The clinical relevance of the renal effects in rats is uncertain. In clinical trials, abemaciclib has been shown to 
increase serum creatinine due to inhibition of renal tubular secretion transporters. There was no indication of 
renal dysfunction in patients. Information regarding the effect on serum creatinine is included in sections 4.5 
and 4.8 of the SmPC. See further the Clinical Pharmacokinetics Assessment Report.  
Effects on the lung  
Abemaciclib caused macrophage accumulation in the lung of rats treated at > 10 mg/kg/day for 1 month, and 
at > 3 mg/kg/day for 3 months. At higher doses (30 mg/kg/day in the 1-month study, > 10 mg/kg/day in the 
3-month study) pulmonary inflammation was observed. The Applicant speculated that the inflammatory 
changes might be due to opportunistic infection, exacerbated by abemaciclib-related impairment of the immune 
system. This seems possible.  
Increased frequency of infections was observed in patients treated with abemaciclib in clinical trials. ‘Serious 
infection secondary to neutropenia’ is included as an important potential risk in the RMP. From a non-clinical 
perspective, no further action is considered necessary. 
Other effects 
Adrenal gland microscopic changes (minimal to moderate cortical cytoplasmic eosinophila/decreased 
vacuolation) were observed in dogs treated at > 1 mg/kg/day for 1 month and at > 0.3 mg/kg/day for 3 months. 
Markedly increased serum cholesterol at the same dose levels appeared to be a related effect. At higher dose 
levels, the weight of the adrenal gland was significantly increased. Minimal to slight mononuclear cell infiltration 
was seen in the adrenal gland at > 3 mg/kg/day in the 1-month study. In rats, increased cholesterol was 
observed at > 10 mg/kg/day. The mechanism behind the observed effects on the adrenal gland and cholesterol 
levels is unclear; however, it is not considered to be an adverse effect and no significant changes in cholesterol 
have been observed in patients. 
Some additional non-adverse findings included macrophage accumulation in the gall bladder of dogs treated at 
3 mg/kg/day for 3 months; increased pigment deposition in the splenic red pulp of dogs treated at > 1 
mg/kg/day for 3 months; acinar cell vacuolation in the pancreas, and macrophage vacuolation in the spleen of 
rats at > 30 mg/kg/day.  
Assessment report  
EMA/551438/2018 
Page 29/133 
  
  
Mammary gland atrophy was observed in male rats at > 10 mg/kg/day in the 1-month study. Since no similar 
change was present in female rats or in dogs the clinical relevance is uncertain. Myofiber degeneration was 
present at 50 mg/kg/day in rats treated for 1 month. Since this finding occurred at an exposure ~ 15-fold above 
human therapeutic AUC its clinical relevance is considered low.  
Electrocardiography (ECG) 
In the 4-week and 3-month dog toxicity studies, there were no treatment-related effects on morphology, heart 
rate, QT and QTc intervals.  
Reversibility 
Bone marrow hypocellularity was not reversible in rats. In dogs, there were persistent decreases in red blood 
cells, haemoglobin and haematocrit; however, reticulocytes increased at the end of the recovery period, 
indicating a regenerative response and correlating with microscopic hepatic extramedullary hematopoiesis 
noted in all recovery animals at 10 mg/kg/day.  Testicular degeneration and intratubular cellular debris in the 
epididymis, associated with decreased testicular and epididymal weight did not show any recovery in rats. 
Possible compound-related seminiferous tubule degeneration with minimal hypo/aspermatogenesis and 
corresponding oligo/aspermia in the epididymis was observed in one recovery dog at 10 mg/kg/day.  Since the 
spermatogenic cycle duration in rats and dogs is 48-53 days and ~8 weeks, respectively, the recovery periods 
of 4 weeks were not of sufficient duration to evaluate full recovery. 
Genotoxicity 
Abemaciclib was evaluated in a standard package of in vitro (mutation in bacteria, chromosome aberration) 
and in vivo (rat micronucleus) genotoxicity tests. The doses used in the micronucleus test were much higher 
than the doses used in the 28-day repeat dose toxicity studies. The results were negative and did not reveal 
any evidence of genotoxic potential of abemaciclib. 
Carcinogenicity 
In  accordance  with  ICH  S9,  carcinogenicity  studies  with  abemaciclib  have  not  been  conducted  given  the 
intended treatment of patients with advanced cancer. This is endorsed.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
The effects of abemaciclib on embryo-fetal development was evaluated in the rat, over a dose range of 1, 4 and 
15 mg/kg/day. Decreased food consumption, body weight gain and body weight occurred at > 4 mg/kg/day. 
Maternal performance was not affected by treatment. Decreased uterine and fetal weight was observed at > 4 
mg/kg/day. Increased fetal cardiovascular malformations and variations were observed at 15 mg/kg/day. 
Furthermore, tail malformations in two fetuses from different litters, an increased incidence of rib malformations 
(not statistically significant) and increased skeletal variations, were observed at 15 mg/kg/day.  At 4 mg/kg/day 
there was a minor increase in cardiovascular malformations and variations, of the same type seen at 15 
mg/kg/day. A relationship to treatment with abemaciclib cannot be excluded.  
Exposure (AUC0-24) at 4 mg/kg/day was 5250 ng x h/mL on GD 17, corresponding to a 1.5-fold margin to human 
clinical exposure at 400 mg/day. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity and embryo-fetal development was 1 
Assessment report  
EMA/551438/2018 
Page 30/133 
  
  
mg/kg/day, corresponding to an AUC0-24 of 843 ng x h/mL on GD 17. This is 0.2-fold the clinical exposure at the 
maximum therapeutic dose (400 mg/day) 
Based on these results abemaciclib is considered to be teratogenic in the rat, at clinically relevant exposure 
levels. Appropriate warnings and recommendations are given in section 4.6 of the SmPC.  
The Applicant did not conduct any EFD study in rabbits. This is acceptable in accordance with the 
recommendations in ICH S9, stating that in cases where an EFD study is positive for embryofetal lethality or 
teratogenicity, a confirmatory study in a second species is usually not warranted. 
No studies on fertility or prenatal and postnatal development were conducted. In accordance with ICH S9, the 
absence of these studies is acceptable.  
Toxicokinetic data and interspecies comparison 
Toxicokinetics and interspecies comparison 
After daily oral gavage administration, mean exposures (Cmax and AUC0-24h) to abemaciclib generally increased 
proportionally to dose in rats and dogs. Slight accumulation (1.5 to 3-fold) was observed in both species. There 
was no clear gender difference. The mean AUC0-24h exposure to abemaciclib in rats at the MTD in the 3-month 
study was 31050 ng.h/mL., corresponding to a 9-fold margin to human therapeutic exposure at 400 mg/day. 
The AUC multiples at the NOAEL (1-month study) and LOAEL (3-month study) compared to the clinical AUC were 
~3-4-fold and 1-fold, respectively. In dogs, the mean AUC0-24h exposure at the MTD in the 3-month study was 
1565 ng.h/mL, which was 0.5-fold the human maximum exposure. 
Local Tolerance  
The local tolerance of abemaciclib following oral administration was evaluated in the repeat-dose toxicity 
studies. There were no effects indicating local irritancy in these studies. The potential for ocular and dermal 
irritation was assessed in the bovine corneal opacity and permeability (BCOP) in vitro test, and an in vivo dermal 
toxicity study in rats, respectively. The results indicate that abemaciclib is a non-irritant to eyes and skin.  
Other toxicity studies 
Metabolites 
The two major human metabolites M2 and M20 were analysed in the 3-month rat and dog studies. In rats, 
exposure in terms of AUC0-24h was higher than in humans. Thus M2 has been toxicologically qualified. The 
exposure to M20 was 22-fold less than that observed in humans. However, in excreta M20 and its downstream 
metabolite M21 were eliminated in dogs at similar levels (as % dose) to that in humans (see Pharmacokinetics). 
In accordance with ICH S9, toxicological qualification of human metabolites is not required for patients with 
advanced cancer.  
M2 and M20 were evaluated for genotoxicity in bacterial mutation (Ames) and chromosome aberrations in vitro 
tests. Both metabolites were negative in the Ames test. The M2 and M20 studies were not in conformity with GLP 
but the applicant has provided a detailed description of formulation and stability which supports the validity of 
the studies. In the in vitro chromosomal aberration tests, M2 and M20 in the 3-hour assays with or without 
metabolic activation caused a significant increase in the number of cells with endoreduplication. According to the 
Assessment report  
EMA/551438/2018 
Page 31/133 
  
  
Applicant, this could have been due to an effect on the mitotic process or disruption of the cell cycle. For the 
present application no follow-up studies are considered necessary; however, in case of a future application 
outside the scope of ICH S9 the Applicant is recommended to conduct additional experiments in vitro and/or in 
vivo, in line with the ICH S2R1 guideline on genotoxicity testing. 
Phototoxicity 
There was no evidence of cutaneous or ocular phototoxicity after a 3 day oral (gavage) administration of 
abemaciclib at doses up to 40 mg/kg/day in pigmented Long Evans rats, following a single exposure to UVR 
approximately 2 hours after the final dose administration. 
2.7.3.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Summary of main study results 
The environmental risk assessment (ERA) for abemaciclib covers a full ERA phase I, IIA and IIB including PBT 
assessment and is only based on the parent compound and not any of the metabolites. Abemaciclib is slightly 
lipophilic with a log KOW of 3.6 at pH7. The default Phase I surface water predicted environmental concentration 
(PECSW) was calculated to 2.0ug/L (based on Fpen = 1%). A refined Phase IIB PECSW calculation gives 0.033ug/L 
(see also Non-clinical discussion).    
Abemaciclib is not readily biodegradable. It is a very persistent molecule in most environmental mediums, 
demonstrating very little chemical degradation in water (<10% hydrolysis at 50°C), a DT50 of a maximum of 
744d in sediment (estimated for 12°C), a sludge DT50 of 107d (with weak to moderate primary biodegradation 
and almost no ultimate biodegradation) and sludge adsorption KdOC > 10000L/kg, and a soil DT50 of up to 2629d 
with soil KfOC between 242804 and 1947392L/kg. Abemaciclib seems to move relatively quickly into sediment 
from water (~91% after 14d).  
The minimum NOEC in the standard aquatic toxicity package was 5.9ug/L (microalgae; P. subcapitata, 72h; 
mean yield endpoint), nominally triggering the toxicity classification (T<10ug/L) in a PBT assessment. Daphnids 
were almost as sensitive with a NOEC of 20ug/L. The lipid and growth corrected kinetic bioconcentration factor 
(BCF) in fish (Bluegill) was 289-383L/kg and as such below the trigger for bioaccumulation (2000L/kg) in PBT 
(see also Non-clinical discussion). As abemaciclib has a log KOW>3, is resistant to hydrolysis and has high 
adsorption, a secondary poisoning discussion has been provided by the applicant (see also Non-clinical 
discussion). The organic content (OC) normalized (10%) NOEC for sediment-dweller toxicity in C. riparius was 
780mg/kg. The lowest NOEC (OC2% normalized) was the NOEC 82mg/kg (pre-normalized NOEC 243mg/kg) for 
acute toxicity in earthworm (E. fetida). The most sensitive plant species was tomato, demonstrating 
phytotoxicity with an NOECOC2% of 322mg/kg (pre-normalized NOEC 108mg/kg).  Abemaciclib did not 
demonstrate any potential for bacterial toxicity with NOECs between 970 and 1020mg/kg for sludge and soil 
microorganisms.

In the fish bioconcentration study (OECD TG305), while the BCF (see ERA summary table) was calculated to be 
<2000L/kg and therefore unlikely to bioaccumulate, it can be noted that depurination was incomplete within the 
study boundary (uptake duration before steady state: 42d, an experimental depurination period of 60d). The 
length of the depurination was likely to short as the radioactivity of the whole body did not sink to initial 
exposure levels. The risk for secondary poisoning was assessed by the applicant, giving a PEC oral, top predator of 
13ug/kg fish, a LOAEL oral, mammal of 12 mg/kg food (based on 0.3mg/kg 90d gavage exposure in dog) and a PNEC 
oral of 40ug/kg food (based on a food conversion factor CONV of 40). The PNEC was based on the dog LOAEL and 
an Assessment factor (AF) of 326.7 (the sum of uncertainty factors: LOAEL --> NOAEL 10x; 90d sub-chronic 
exposure to chronic exposure 3x; interspecies uncertainty 3.3x; Lab to field uncertainty 3.3x). The applicant 
argues that because dog is much more sensitive than the most sensitive NOAEL in a second species (10 mg/kg 
in rats), an uncertainty factor of 3.3x (instead of 10x) is considered appropriate to account for interspecies 
sensitivity. The logic underlying the interspecies argument is not clear but in both AF cases, the PEC oral, top predator 
is formally less than the PNEC oral (although with a very small margin for AF 30x). As such, and considering the 
additional uncertainty factors included (10x & 3x & 3.3x & 3.3x = ~327x), it is agreed that there is not sufficient 
evidence to classify abemaciclib as a secondary poisoning risk. That being said, the incomplete depuration with 
an elimination half-life of 115 days (tissue concentrations of 45 - 48% after 60 days) should be mentioned in the 
final assessment and EPAR as the incomplete depuration is an important information. 
2.7.4.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology: The pharmacological data provide a molecular and cellular level of mechanism of action. The 
proof of principle for the therapeutic indication (breast cancer) is evaluated in traditional cancer animal models 
(i.e. mostly ectotopic cancer cell line/tumour fragment xenograft rodent models). This leaves the common 
Assessment report  
EMA/551438/2018 
Page 35/133 
  
  
 
 
tumour development, drug efficacy and immunology-related uncertainties about microenvironment-tumour 
relations when using such models.  
The Applicant considers the pharmacologically active metabolites to be equivalent to the parent compound 
based on biochemical affinity, but there is some additional variation in biological effects of these metabolites in 
various in-vitro test systems (indicating that the affinity values are not fully representative of biological 
similarity). Besides the target proteins, abemaciclib seems to target other enzymes such as PIM1 at clinically 
relevant concentrations. After follow-up question, the applicant provided further discussion on the 
pharmacodynamic role of PIM1 and refers to several studies (non-submitted) that seem to indicate that the 
inhibition of PIM1 helps in the intended therapy. So, while the data cannot be assessed for a definitive inclusion 
of PIM1 among the target proteins, this nominally indicates that PIM1 may be relevant for the pharmacodynamic 
effect. 
There are some minor indications that combination treatment with fulvestrant alternatively tamoxifen may 
increase the potency of abemaciclib in breast cancer xenograft mouse models. Overall, there are no major 
issues about nonclinical pharmacology. 
Pharmacokinetics: The non-clinical pharmacokinetic profile of abemaciclib is considered to have been 
adequately characterized. Rats and dogs were chosen by the Applicant as target species for the toxicology 
studies. Despite a few differences in metabolic pathways, these species showed qualitatively a similar metabolic 
profile as humans and are thus considered adequate for evaluation of the toxicity of abemaciclib.  
Toxicology: The bone marrow, lymphoid tissues, male reproductive organs and intestines were identified as 
target organs in both rats and dogs. Additional target organs in rats were the kidney and lung, and in dog the 
adrenal glands. Regarding the renal effects in rat, this information has been included in the SmPC 5.3. In clinical 
trials, abemaciclib has been shown to increase serum creatinine due to inhibition of renal tubular secretion 
transporters. Moreover, information regarding the effect on serum creatinine is also is included in sections 4.5 
and 4.8 of the SmPC. Because acute kidney injury was also reported in about 2% (consistent with GI adverse 
effects), it was decided that this should however be closely monitored within PSURs in the case of an approval. 
Intestinal crypt hyperplasia were observed in rat and dog repeat dose toxicity studies, but are considered to 
reflect a regenerative response. 
The majority of effects are considered directly or indirectly related to the pharmacological inhibition of cell 
replication in tissues due to CDK4/6 inhibition. Toxicity occurred at clinically relevant exposures. Most findings 
were reversible or showed a tendency for reversibility and can be monitored in the clinical situation; male 
reproductive toxicity being an exception. Abemaciclib is teratogenic in the rat. Appropriate information 
concerning identified safety risks is given in the RMP, and in the SmPC. 
Genotoxicity studies on metabolites M2 and M20 were not in full conformity with GLP but the missing aspects 
were not considered to detract the validity of the studies. It can be noted that the applicant is conducting a 
2-year rat carcinogenicity study to support indications that are not advanced cancer and in addition and also 
preparing to conduct a 2-year mouse carcinogenicity study. 
ERA: Overall, abemaciclib is expected to accumulate in the abiotic environment. While it has the potential to act 
as an aquatic toxicant, it does not fulfil the criteria for being classified as a PBT or vPvB candidate (environmental 
hazard) and the overall emission into the environment is insufficient for it to be considered an environmental 
risk.

Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical data submitted to evaluate the pharmacology, pharmacokinetic and toxicity is considered 
acceptable.  
Abemaciclib is not a PBT substance. Considering the submitted data, abemaciclib is not expected to pose a 
significant risk to the environment.

2.8.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The single dose clinical pharmacology program has been performed in healthy volunteers, subjects with hepatic 
impairment, and in patients with cancer, whereas the multiple dose studies were performed in patients with 
advanced cancer. 
Active moiety 
In plasma, two major active metabolites have been identified, beside the parent compound. The metabolites M2, 
M18 and M20 exhibit similar potency in the enzyme binding biochemical assays as the parent drug, and have 
been analysed in many of the clinical trials. M18 has a lower exposure than the other species. 
Absorption  
An absolute bioavailability study of abemaciclib was performed in 11 healthy subject using an intravenous tracer 
method. The subjects received a single oral dose of abemaciclib and 6 h later on the same day an iv 
administration of approximately 0.4 mg 13C8-abemaciclib. The absolute bioavailability was estimated to 45%, 
with modest between-subject variability (CV 19%).  
Phase I and II studies have been performed with early capsule formulations (C1 and C2) and the C3 capsule 
formulation, and the registration studies (MONARCH 1-3) have been performed with the C3 capsule formulation 
(mainly the 50 mg strength). A bioequivalence study was performed to compare the tablet formulation to be 
marketed (50 mg, 150 mg) to the capsule formulation C3 (50 mg). Bioequivalence was shown for both Cmax 
and AUC for both 3x50 mg tablet and 150 mg tablet compared with the capsules used in pivotal trials, with 
narrow confidence intervals and ratios close to 1. 
The effect of a high-fat meal on abemaciclib PK after administration of the 150 mg tablet (commercial 
formulation T1) was investigated in 24 healthy subjects. Food slightly increased the exposure to abemaciclib, 
with a 13% higher AUCinf and 29% higher Cmax in the fed state. A minor increase in the exposure to the 
Assessment report  
EMA/551438/2018 
Page 39/133 
  
  
 
 
metabolites M2 and M20 was also observed (AUCinf 11% and 2% higher, respectively). No difference in tmax 
was detected. 
Distribution 
The geometric mean systemic volume of distribution is approximately 750 L (69% CV). 
In vitro protein binding of abemaciclib (0.3-10 µM) in human plasma as well as human liver microsomes was 
tested using a 6 h equilibrium dialysis and at 0.3 µM (average clinical Cmax) 97% of the drug was bound to 
plasma proteins. In a new in vitro study including also the active metabolites, the average protein binding at 1 
µM was 94% for abemaciclib, 92% for M2 and 98% for M20. These data were used in the calculation of active 
moiety.  
Ex vivo plasma protein binding of abemaciclib and its metabolites was also determined in plasma samples from 
the hepatic impairment study, taken approximately 6 hours after dose. Equilibrium dialysis was used. In healthy 
subject, protein binding of abemaciclib was 96%, M2 93% and M20 98%. Protein binding was lower in subjects 
with severe hepatic impairment.  
Elimination 
A mass-balance study was performed, where 6 healthy subjects received a single oral dose of 150 mg 
LY2835219 containing [14C]-LY2835219 (approximately 5 μCi) administered as an oral solution under fasting 
condition (10 h before and 4 hours after dose). The overall recovery in the study was 84.4%. A mean (±SD) of 
81.0 (±6.71)% of the dose was excreted in faeces and 3.43 (±2.20)% was excreted in urine through the last 
collection interval (336 hours postdose). Most of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the first 192 
hours postdose in faeces (73.4%). Due to the low amounts of drug retrieved in urine, metabolite profiling was 
only performed in faeces. Parent drug and 6 metabolites (M1, M2, M18, M20, M21, and M22) were identified in 
faeces, and together they added up to 59% of the administered dose, representing approximately 70% of 
recovered radioactivity. The major metabolite excreted was the oxidative metabolite M2

oral administration of a single 150-mg dose of [14C]-LY2835219 in Healthy Subjects 
P-gp as well as BCRP substrate assessment of abemaciclib and M2 was conducted using Madin-Darby canine 
kidney (MDCK) cell monolayers transfected with human multi-drug resistance gene (MDR1) at a substrate 
concentration of 5 µM. Both entities were shown to be substrates for both P-gp and BCRP. In an in vitro study in 
HEK cells transfected with transporter genes, it was concluded that abemaciclib was not a substrate of OATP1B1 
but technical issues precluded conclusions on OATP1B3.  
In vitro studies using human recombinant CYPs and substrate depletion indicate that the CYP-catalysed 
metabolism of both abemaciclib and its active metabolites M2 and M20 is almost entirely catalysed by CYP3A4.  
The plasma profile of total radioactivity, parent compound and major metabolites after a single dose of 
abemaciclib are displayed in Figure 2. Parent compound constituted 34% of total plasma radioactivity whereas 
the major metabolites M2 and M20 were 13 and 26%, respectively. M18 was approximately 5% of total 
radioactivity.

The metabolism scheme proposed by the Applicant is shown below: 
Figure 4. Abemaciclib (LY2835219) and metabolites eliminated in faeces [as % dose] following a single oral 
150-mg dose of abemaciclib containing approximately 5 μCi of [14C]-abemaciclib in healthy human subjects.  
An interaction study with clarithromycin confirmed the role of CYP3A4 in abemaciclib metabolism. The estimated 
fraction metabolised by CYP3A4 (fm) in the PBPK analysis was 0.89. Metabolites M2 and M20 are both substrates 
for CYP3A4, and CYP3A4 metabolism seems to be important for their elimination. M2 is also retrieved in faeces.  
M2 is a substrate for P-gp as well as BCRP, and these transport proteins may contribute to the active secretion 
of M2. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Single-dose data did not indicate any major deviation from dose proportionality. In the multiple dose, 
dose-escalation trial, preliminary analysis of PK data from the initial 4 dose levels tested with once daily dosing 
(50, 100, 150, and 225 mg Q24H) indicated less than dose-proportional increases in exposure. Due to this 
tendency, a twice-daily schedule was introduced, and doses from 75 to 275 mg BID were tested, with no major 
deviation from dose proportionality observed. In the QT study doses between 200 and 600 mg were tested, 
without signs of non-linearity. In both the popPK-modelling and in the PBPK model, a non-linear component is 
however included, suggesting lower bioavailability at higher doses. 
In study JPBA, the accumulation index at the clinical doses 150 and 200 mg was estimated to 2.5-2.6, which is 
in line with what would be expected for a drug with a half-life around 24 hours.

Population pharmacokinetics 
A population approach was used to characterize the PK of abemaciclib in target population and healthy subjects, 
characterize the between-patient variability, assess intrinsic and extrinsic factors that could significantly 
influence abemaciclib, and estimate individual patient exposure for exposure-response analyses. 
The analyses are based on the SAEM estimation method and the final models have not met the criteria for 
convergence and hence statistical testing based on the based on the objective function value is not valid. Due to 
the computational intensity of the mechanistic model no formal covariate search was conducted instead a 
graphical analysis was used to determine inclusion of covariates. The Applicant states that the graphical 
covariate evaluation based on Bayesian posthoc estimates (eta values) is valid due to low shrinkage. However, 
it is difficult to assess whether the parameter estimates are affected by the non-convergence (the Monte Carlo 
noise) as it seems to have been present throughout the model development process. The issue of Monte Carlo 
noise introduces an uncertainty in the reliability of the population PK parameter estimates. The results from the 
population PK analysis are not accepted due to the uncertainties in the model development, although the 
population PK results are not pivotal for this application and further model development is not pursued. 
However, for future use of the population PK model issues regarding non-convergence, handling of BLQ data, 
and coding of time varying covariates (e.g. diarrhoea) need to be addressed.

As the population PK analysis provided is not of acceptable quality, the evaluation of co-variates performed with 
the model cannot be used to draw conclusions on the influence of renal function, age, gender or weight on 
abemaciclib pharmacokinetics.  
No dedicated renal impairment study was performed. Patients with mild and moderate renal impairment were 
included in the pivotal studies.  
A single 200 mg dose pharmacokinetic study of abemaciclib in subjects with varying degree of hepatic 
impairment, was performed. Subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment had a similar average 
abemaciclib drug exposure as subjects with normal liver function, but with a tendency to lower Cmax. Subjects 
with severe hepatic impairment had geometric least square (LS) mean AUC0-∞ of abemaciclib that was 2.09 
(90% CI: 1.33, 3.28) times higher than that observed in control subjects. The average abemaciclib half-life was 
longer in patients with severe hepatic impairment. A slower absorption was observed in subjects with hepatic 
impairment, and tmax was increased from 7h in subjects with normal liver function to 24 h in subjects with 
severe hepatic impairment. On the other hand, a lower exposure of the active metabolites M2 and M20 was 
observed with increasing grade of hepatic impairment.

When total analytes were considered (abemaciclib + M2+M20) there was only a marginal difference between 
the groups, the increase in parent drug exposure was outweighed by decreased metabolite exposure (ratio of 
geometric means for AUCinf was 0.82, 0.82 and 1.20 for mild, moderate and severe HI, respectively, compared 
with normal liver function). The protein binding of abemaciclib as well as of the metabolites decreased with 
increased degrees of hepatic impairment. The average fu of abemaciclib was increased from 3.7% in subjects 
with normal hepatic function to around 5% in mild and moderate hepatic impairment and 7.8% in plasma from 
subjects with severe hepatic impairment. For active moiety (defined as the sum of unbound potency adjusted 
exposure to parent+M2+M20) , the geometric LS mean AUC(0-∞)u was similar to that observed in control 
subjects in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment but were  2.35 time s higher, respectively, in 
subjects with severe hepatic impairment compared to control subjects. 
A separate phase I study was performed in Japanese subjects. Tolerability of the 200 mg BID dose was 
confirmed in this population. The PK variability was large, but the average exposure (AUC0-Τ,ss) in the 200 mg 
group (3020 ngxh/ml; CV 73%) was found to be similar to the exposure after 200 mg abemaciclib in the 
previous phase I study (JPBA; 3000 ngxh/ml; CV 69%). No further data on the influence of race on abemaciclib 
pharmacokinetics is available. 
In the popPK model, the Applicant has included diarrhoea as a covariate on bioavailability. The effect of 
diarrhoea on abemaciclib pharmacokinetics has not been further discussed in the application. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro data 
A full in vitro DDI program has been performed. The cutoff for clinical relevance of systemic interactions 
(50xCmax,u) was 0.5 µM. Using the absorption parameters proposed by the Applicant, the hepatic inlet cutoff 
(25xCmaxu, inlet) was 1.9 µM. Worstcase concentration in the gut 0.1xdose/250 ml) would be 160 µM.  
No direct inhibition by abemaciclib or the metabolites M2 or M20 of any of the CYP enzymes tested was observed 
at plasma concentrations relevant for systemic exposure. A slight inhibition (28% and 33%, respectively) of 
CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 was observed at the highest concentration tested (12.5 uM). No data was available at 
concentrations relevant for gastrointestinal exposure. The risk for time-dependent inhibition could be excluded 
at systemic concentrations, but the concentration range did not cover concentrations relevant for 
gastrointestinal exposure.In vitro induction was studied in two studies with human hepatocytes. No induction 
was observed, but a trend to a dose-dependent decrease in mRNA expression was seen for some of the 
enzymes. No data was available at concentrations relevant for gastrointestinal exposure. A clinical DDI study is 
underway to address potential effects of abemaciclib on CYP enzymes (see below). 
Abemaciclib inhibited both P-gp and BCRP in vitro in membrane vesicles. Systemic P-gp inhibition is not likely 
based on the in vitro data, but a risk for inhibition of both P-gp and BCRP in the gastrointestinal tract, as well as 
systemic BCRP, could not be excluded. A DDI study with the P-gp substrate loperamide was performed (see 
below), but no study with a BCRP substrate was performed. Inhibition of OAT transporters were not seen, and 
OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 were inhibited only at concentrations higher than the cut-off for clinical relevance. A risk 
for clinical inhibition of OCT1, OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2 could not be excluded based on in vitro data. A clinical 
DDI study with metformin was performed (see below).  
Assessment report  
EMA/551438/2018

In vivo data 
In vivo DDI studies with clarithromycin and rifampicin (abemaciclib as a victim) as well as metformin and 
loperamide (abemaciclib as a perpetrator) were performed and are summarised below. The applicant is 
recommended to submit data generated from an ongoing DDI study to address abemaciclib as a perpetrator for 
CYP-medicated drug-drug interactions.  
A 2-period fixed sequence study was performed to investigate the impact of CYP3A inhibition by clarithromycin 
on abemaciclib metabolism. In period 1, a single oral 50 mg abemaciclib dose was administered, followed by 7 
days washout. In period 2, clarithromycin 500 mg was administered twice daily for 5 days. On day 5, 
abemaciclib was administered as a single, 50-mg dose approximately 30 minutes following the clarithromycin 
dose. Clarithromycin dosing was continued for 7 more days following single-dose administration of abemaciclib. 
PK sampling for abemaciclib as well as M2, M18, and M20 was performed 7 days after dose in period 1 and 10 
days after dose in period 2. Clarithromycin co-administration increased drug exposure after a single dose 
abemaciclib. The effect was larger on abemaciclib (AUCinf increased 3.4 fold) than on active moiety (defined as 
the potency adjusted sum of unbound parent+M2+M20) which increased 2.5-fold.  
Figure 5. Arithmetic mean plasma concentration-time profiles of abemaciclib (left panel) and total analytes 
(right panel) following a single dose of 50 mg abemaciclib alone or with 500 mg clarithromycin Q12H. 
A two-period, fixed-sequence study was performed to investigate the impact of CYP3A induction by rifampin on 
the metabolism of abemaciclib in healthy subjects. Abemaciclib was administered orally as a single, 200-mg 
dose on 2 occasions; alone on Day 1 of Period 1 and in combination with 600 mg rifampin on Day 7 of Period 2, 
after 6 days of once daily rifampicin dosing. 
Rifampicin co-treatment decreased abemaciclib exposure substantially, AUCinf decreased by 95%. Also the 
metabolites M2 and M20 had decreased exposure, but the effect was smaller (65% and 80%, respectively).

(right panel) following a single dose of 200 mg abemaciclib alone or with 600 mg once-daily rifampin in healthy 
subjects. 
A 4-period, randomized, placebo controlled, crossover study was performed in healthy subjects to investigate 
the effect of 400 mg abemaciclib on renal transporters OCT2, MATE1, and MATE2-K, as assessed by the PK of 
metformin, and on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as assessed by intravenous (IV) iohexol clearance (CL). Forty 
subjects (4 male, 36 female) were randomized to 1 of 4 treatment sequences, and received abemaciclib or 
placebo during 4 periods (2 metformin assessment periods and 2 iohexol assessment periods). During the 
metformin assessment periods, subjects received a single oral 400-mg dose of abemaciclib or placebo, followed 
by a single oral 1000-mg dose of metformin 5 hours later. During the iohexol assessment periods, subjects 
received a single oral 400-mg dose of abemaciclib or placebo followed by 5 mL (3235 mg) of Omnipaque 300 
(iohexol) solution 8 hours later, infused over approximately 15 minutes. Metformin was assessed both in plasma 
and in urine for 36 hour post metformin dose. 
Abemaciclib significantly increased metformin exposure compared to placebo, with increases in AUC0-∞ and 
Cmax by 37% and 22%, respectively, and significantly decreased metformin CL, with decreases in renal 
clearance (CLR) and renal secretion clearance (CLRS) of 45% (CLR ratio 0.550) and 62% (CLRS ratio 0.381), 
respectively. A single oral dose of 400 mg abemaciclib, compared to placebo, had no effect on GFR as measured 
by iohexol clearance 
A DDI study with the P-gp substrate loperamide was also performed. Following a single dose of 8 mg loperamide 
coadministered with 400 mg abemaciclib, the mean AUC(0-tlast), AUC(0-∞), and Cmax values for loperamide 
were increased by 13%, 9%, and 35%, respectively, compared to 8 mg loperamide administered alone or with 
placebo. Larger increases were observed for N-desmethyl loperamide, the principal metabolite of loperamide, 
increased 94% in AUC0-tlast 47% in AUC0-∞ and 133% in Cmax, when loperamide was coadministered with 
abemaciclib.

subjects.
An ongoing DDI study using a cocktail approach is performed to assess the effect of multiple doses of 
abemaciclib on the PK of the CYP substrates midazolam, caffeine, warfarin and dextromethorphan. An interim 
analysis presented does not indicate clinically relevant effects on the investigated substrates, but assessment of 
the study awaits final data that the Applicant is recommended to submit. 
Pharmacokinetic data from a Phase 1b, multicentre, outpatient, nonrandomized, open-label study to examine 
the safety and tolerability of abemaciclib in combination with letrozole, anastrozole, tamoxifen, or exemestane 
in patients with HR+ and HER2- mBC was also provided. No single-agent data was provided, and 
dose-adjustment was allowed during the study, and thus no formal evaluation of a potential pharmacokinetic 
interaction could be performed. Comparing data from day 1 and day 28, as well as comparing with historical data 
did not indicate any major PK interaction between abemaciclib and the endocrine acting agents.  
Abemaciclib is a weakly basic drug that shows pH dependent solubility, with lower solubility at pH 6.8 than at 
lower pH. No clinical study to evaluate the impact of acid-reducing agents on abemaciclib absorption has been 
performed. The Applicant argues that as the highest dose of abemaciclib (200 mg) is soluble in less than 250 mL 
Assessment report  
EMA/551438/2018 
Page 48/133 
  
  
 
 
up to pH 6.8, coadministered acid-reducing agents are unlikely to have an effect on the absorption and exposure 
of abemaciclib. In addition, the solubility of abemaciclib drug substance in simulated fasted and fed intestinal 
fluid is much greater than at pH 6.8, at 5.3mg/mL and 31 mg/mL, respectively. 
No DDI study with oral contraceptives has been performed. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
2.8.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Mechanism of action 
Abemaciclib is an inhibitor of CDK4 and CDK6 and was most active against Cyclin D1/CDK4 in enzymatic assays.  
In breast cancer, Cyclin D1/CDK4 has been shown to promote phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein 
(Rb), cell proliferation, and tumor growth. Abemaciclib inhibits Rb phosphorylation, blocking progression from 
G1 into S phase of the cell cycle, leading to suppression of tumor growth in preclinical models following short 
duration target inhibition.  In ER+ breast cancer cell lines, sustained target inhibition by abemaciclib prevented 
rebound of Rb phosphorylation and cell cycle reentry, resulting in senescence and apoptosis.  In vivo, 
abemaciclib as a single agent dosed daily without interruption at clinically relevant concentrations in breast 
cancer xenograft models resulted in reduction of tumor size. 
In addition to inhibiting phosphorylation of Rb, inhibition of CDK4 and CDK6 resulted in inhibition of 
topoisomerase II alpha (topoIIα) expression.

Genetic differences in PD response 
Clinically, a molecular correlate of variable sensitivity to CDK 4/6 inhibition has not been identified; in 
registration trials for the approved inhibitors plabociclib and ribociclib no compelling evidence of differential 
efficacy in subgroups defined by Cyclin D1, RB or P16 mRNA or protein expression has emerged. 
Preclinical findings indicate that there may be a molecularly well-defined group of patients with compromised 
benefit. Different levels of the CDK-RB-E2F axis may be important to further characterize in treated patients, 
preferably in the randomized treatment setting, including the CDK4/6 target and other cyclin-dependent 
kinases, RB and related transcriptional repressors p107 and p130, and redundancy of E2F and downstream 
transcriptional effects. 
MONARCH-2 and MONARCH-3 
According to the MONARCH-2 and MONARCH-3 study reports, tumor tissue (FFPE) was required to be provided 
by investigator sites in conjunction with enrollment; the use of IHC, FISH, RNA and gene-expression profiling is 
mentioned as methods to investigate CDK4 and CDK6 pathway components (for example, Rb) and markers 
relevant to breast cancer pathogenesis. Correlating findings with clinical efficacy data was foreseen. Blood and 
plasma samples were also to be collected for similar purposes. 
No findings regarding these exploratory biomarker analyses have been made available. The applicant expects to 
have clinical trial biomarker data for MONARCH 3 in the fourth quarter of 2018. The experimental work is 
ongoing and should yield instructive data by the first quarter of 2019. A category 3 post-authorization measure 
is proposed encompassing biomarker analyses in MONARCH 2 and MONARCH 3. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Relationship between plasma concentration and efficacy 
PK/PD analyses were provided for objective response rate and progression free survival (MONARCH 1) and in 
MONARCH 2 a dynamic population PK/PD model was developed to describe the relationship between dose, 
plasma concentration (total active moiety), tumour size and progression free survival.  
Relationship between plasma concentration and safety 
Dose was identified as a significant factor related to diarrhea occurrence and timing of onset. 
In the MONARCH 2 and MONARCH 3 populations, there was a relationship between dose/exposure and 
neutropenia.  
Concentration QT 
Abemaciclib does not cause clinically significant Fridericia’s corrected QT (QTcF) prolongation.  In an 
exposure-response analysis in healthy subjects at exposures comparable to those achieved for a 200-mg 
twice-daily dose, the upper bounds of the 2-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) for the effects of abemaciclib and 
its active metabolites in placebo- and baseline-corrected QTcF were less than 10 msec.

2.8.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
A fundamental question that determines the usefulness of PK data of abemaciclib, is to find a reliable definition 
of active moiety. In most studies, both parent compound and the active metabolites M2 and M20 were 
measured, sometimes also M18. A sum of parent+M2 +M20 was first proposed as the active moiety, but in the 
second round of assessment the Applicant proposed a new definition of active moiety, namely sum of potency 
adjusted unbound parent+M2+M20. It is agreed that the new active moiety appears more scientifically sound, 
but the issue remains that the active moiety concept is very hypothetical and highly dependent on the input 
values of e.g. potency and protein binding. Based on the inherent uncertainties in the use of an active-moiety 
estimation, the DDI results and PBPK output should not be over-interpreted. The dose adjustments for drug 
interactions and organ impairment need to be modest to avoid risk for underexposure, and followed by intensive 
monitoring of toxicity. 
A slight increase (13%) in abemaciclib exposure after administration of a 150 mg tablet together with a high-fat 
meal was observed. The influence of food was very small compared to overall variability, and it is agreed that 
this food-effect is unlikely to be clinically relevant. The recommendation that abemaciclib can be administered 
with or without food is agreed. 
The mean recovery in the mass-balance study was 84%, and of the recovered dose, around 70% was identified. 
This is somewhat lower than recommended in guideline. However, it seems unlikely that the study would have 
missed any major elimination pathway or major metabolite. Only a small fraction of the dose (3%) was found in 
urine, indicating a minor role of renal elimination. In vitro and in vivo data confirm that CYP3A4 is the most 
important enzyme in the metabolism of abemaciclib. The two major plasma metabolites, M2 and M20, are 
excreted in faeces or further metabolised, mainly by CYP3A4.  
Only 7% was retrieved as parent compound in faeces, which suggests high absorption. A low amount of 
unchanged drug in faeces is in itself however not enough to conclude high permeability. There are no data 
presented regarding abemaciclib stability in the gastrointestinal tract. No in vitro permeability data was 
presented. 
Abemaciclib as well as M2 were shown to be in vitro substrates of P-gp and BCRP, but mass balance data suggest 
that P-gp or BCRP transport is unlikely to be of importance for absorption and elimination of parent compound. 
Excretion of the active metabolite M2 into faeces may however be mediated by P-gp/BCRP efflux, which 
suggests a risk for increased M2 levels if co-administering P-gp inhibitors. A clinical DDI study with the CYP3A4 
as well as P-gp inhibitor clarithromycin has been performed, but the relative role of P-gp- and CYP3A4 inhibition 
in the increase in M2 exposure cannot be elucidated based on these data. 
The in vitro studies submitted do not indicate that abemaciclib or its metabolites are substrates of the hepatic 
transporters OATP1B1/ 3 or OCT1. There are however technical issues with some of the experiments. The 
applicant is recommended to submit additional in vitro data on OATP1B3 to facilitate the final conclusion 
regarding the role of active hepatic uptake  
Data suggests an approximately dose-linear pharmacokinetics of abemaciclib, and the observed accumulation is 
roughly in line with the reported half-life of abemaciclib, indicating no major time dependency. Data on 
metabolite exposure is however not sufficiently presented to address a potential time dependency in metabolism 
pattern, but as the issue of time dependency is unlikely to largely affect overall conclusions, this issue is not 
pursued. 
According to the CSR of study JPBA, the reason for choosing the twice-daily dosing was a concern that the 
absorption of abemaciclib would decrease at higher doses with the once daily dosing. With more data emerging 
Assessment report  
EMA/551438/2018 
Page 51/133 
  
  
this saturation tendency was no longer observed, and the scientific rationale for a BID dosing appears somewhat 
unclear. Given that all pivotal trials are performed with this dosing frequency, this issue is not further pursued. 
Special populations 
Given that the population PK modelling is considered inadequate, the evaluation of renal function, age, gender, 
race and weight performed with the population PK model cannot be used. As no other analysis is available for 
many of these factors, data is lacking for many special populations. It is acknowledged that influence of these 
factors are difficult to study without a popPK model, as the active metabolites also need to be taken into account 
to address clinical relevance of any effects observed. As it is considered unlikely that any of these co-variates 
alone would have a major impact on the PK of abemaciclib, and that the variability in PK in general is handled 
with dose adjustments, this issue is not further pursued and lack of data is accepted. To compensate for 
uncertainty in the covariate effects of body weight, the relationship between progression free survival and body 
weight was investigated, as further described in the discussion of exposure-response relationships.  
Neither abemaciclib nor its active metabolites are excreted unchanged in urine, and no effect of mild or 
moderate renal impairment is expected. In general, an effect of severe renal impairment on hepatically 
eliminated drugs cannot be excluded and the Applicant has not discussed the lack of data in severe renal 
impairment further. As a potential increased exposure to abemaciclib can be handled with dose adjustments 
based on tolerability, the lack of data in severe renal impairment is however considered acceptable.  
The Applicant has performed a full hepatic impairment study, and the overall design appears relevant. In 
general, the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of abemaciclib and its metabolites was 
modest. Total abemaciclib exposure increased with increased severity of hepatic impairment, whereas the 
exposure to the active metabolites decreased, leading to a similar exposure to active moiety for subjects in all 
groups. A decreased protein binding in subjects with severe hepatic impairment however lead to substantially 
higher unbound active moiety exposure in patients with severe HI (2-3 times).The Applicant proposes that no 
dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild and moderate HI, which is endorsed. In patients with severe 
hepatic impairment, a decrease in dosing frequency to once daily is recommended based on the longer half-life 
and the 2-3 times higher exposure to unbound active moiety observed in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment. This recommendation is agreed.  
It seems likely that diarrhoea can affect abemaciclib absorption, and diarrhoea was identified as a covariate in 
the popPK. The effect of diarrhoea on abemaciclib PK is not possible to quantify based on the popPK model 
submitted. This issue is not further pursued as diarrhoea is very common in the study and will be treated 
pharmacologically in the clinical situation. 
Interactions 
Abemaciclib is a CYP3A4 substrate and is therefore significantly affected both by CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers. 
• 
Effect of abemaciclib on other medicines (as perpetrator) 
The in vitro data on CYP inhibition and induction were not fully conclusive, but this is not an issue as the 
Applicant is performing a cocktail DDI study to address potential effects of abemaciclib on different probe CYP 
substrate. An interim analysis did not indicate any clinically relevant CYP inhibition or induction. The applicant is 
recommended to submit the  final results as soon as available. 
Abemaciclib inhibited BCRP and P-gp in vitro. A clinical study with loperamide as a P-gp substrate has been 
performed. No DDI study has been performed to address the risk for clinical interaction with BCRP substrates. 
Although unfortunate, this is acceptable due to the low number of known sensitive substrates. The interpretation 
Assessment report  
EMA/551438/2018 
Page 52/133 
  
  
of the DDI study with loperamide is not straight-forward. Only a marginal increase in loperamide Cmax and AUC 
was observed, suggesting a transient effect of abemaciclib mainly during loperamide absorption, possibly 
through mild P-gp inhibition. The effect on the metabolite was substantial (almost doubled AUC up to 72 
hours).The mechanistic explanation for this is unknown, but P-gp inhibition may contribute. The Applicant 
discusses the potential clinical relevance for co-administration with loperamide, and it is agreed that as the 
metabolite is claimed to be substantially less potent than the parent compound, loperamide can be used without 
dose adjustments together with abemaciclib. 
In vitro inhibition of OCT1, OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2, but not of OATP1B1 and 1B3, was observed at clinically 
relevant concentrations if the sum of the inhibitory effects of abemaciclib and its metabolites are taken into 
account. To address the relevance of the inhibitory effects on OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2, and given that an 
increase in creatinine was observed in the clinical studies, a DDI study with metformin was performed. The 
design of the metformin DDI study allowed a discrimination between effects on renal filtration and active 
transport, and a 37% increase of metformin exposure was shown to occur without affecting GFR, thus being 
attributed to inhibition of renal secretion. This is in line with abemaciclib being an in vitro inhibitor of OCT2, 
MATE1 and MATE2. These data support the theory put forward by the Applicant that the creatinine elevations 
observed clinically is caused by inhibition of renal transport proteins. 
• 
Effect on abemaciclib (as victim) 
The interaction study with clarithromycin verifies a role of CYP3A4 in abemaciclib metabolism. The study is also 
the basis for a starting dose reduction if CYP3A4 inhibitors are used together with abemaciclib. The 
interpretation of the study is complicated by several factors. The different effect on different metabolites and the 
inherent uncertainties in the relative contribution of these entities to efficacy and safety makes quantitative use 
of the data in dose adjustments difficult. In addition, the study design is not optimal, it is performed at a dose 
level of abemaciclib substantially lower than clinical dose and 4 days of clarithromycin pre-treatment is probably 
somewhat short to obtain full effect on CYP3A4. The mechanistic interpretation is also complicated by the fact 
that both major metabolites are substrates of CYP3A4, and M2 is also excreted into faeces via P-gp (which is also 
inhibited by clarithromycin). 
The general recommendation to avoid strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is agreed given the limitations of the DDI study 
with clarithromycin, the unclear relevance of active moiety and the knowledge that stronger inhibitors than 
clarithromycin may give even larger effects on abemaciclib exposure than clarithromycin. When strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors anyhow need to be used the dose should be reduced to 100 mgx2, and patients should be further 
monitored for toxicity. To avoid a risk for under-exposure, no initial dose adjustments are proposed for patients 
taking moderate or weak inhibitors, but regular toxicity monitoring followed by the possibility to reduce the dose 
is deemed sufficient for these patients. 
The Applicant has built a complex PBPK model describing the effects of CYP3A4 interactions on the exposure to 
abemaciclib and its active metabolites, and this effort is acknowledged. There are however several issues with 
this model, and in addition, there are uncertainties about the relative contribution of the active metabolites to 
efficacy and safety that preclude the use of modelling quantitatively in developing dosing recommendations. 
Data from the rifampicin study shows a large effect of the strong inducer rifampicin on the exposure of 
abemaciclib as well as its active metabolites. It is agreed with the Applicant that this large decrease in drug 
exposure cannot be handled with dose adjustments, and that CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided.  
The phase I study evaluating the combination between abemaciclib and letrozole, anastrozole, tamoxifen, or 
exemestane was not designed to evaluate a potential drug-drug interaction between the agents. The two drugs 
were given together during the whole study period, and no single-agent data are available from the study. In 
Assessment report  
EMA/551438/2018 
Page 53/133 
  
  
addition, dose adjustments were performed before the steady state data were collected. The data can thus not 
be used to draw quantitative conclusions on the interaction potential. It is however agreed with the Applicant 
that the data do not suggest any large PK interaction between abemaciclib and any of the endocrine therapies.  
It is agreed that the risk for an interaction with acid reducing agents appears low as the maximum dose of 
abemaciclib can be dissolved in 250 mL at all pH relevant for the stomach. No DDI study is needed. 
Exposure-response relationship 
The Applicant has provided exposure-response analyses for relevant endpoints. However, it is important to point 
out that the uncertainty in the validity of the predicted exposures is propagated onto the results of the 
exposure-response analyses.  
Further, dose reductions limit the interpretability of exposure-response analyses. Although dynamic exposure 
has been used for PFS and neutrophil relationships, the simulated dose-response curves assumes a static dose 
and the comparison to the observed average dose does not fully incorporate the duration of each dose level.   
The Kaplan-Meier quartile analyses for PFS and the effects of body weight display no clear relationship between 
body weight and PFS. 
The effort to provide exposure-response relationships for efficacy and safety are acknowledged, however, the 
uncertainty of the validity of model predicted PK, and confounding factor of dose reductions in interpreting 
exposure-response and subsequent simulated dose-response relationships limits the value of 
exposure-response in support for dose selection. The exposure-response relationships are not further pursued 
as it is not perceived that higher doses would be tolerable and the proposed initial doses are reduced based on 
adverse events. 
2.8.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
There is no objection to an approval of Verzenios from a clinical pharmacology point of view.  
A preclinical-clinical discordance in the impact of RB function on sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibition may indicate a 
group of patients with compromised benefit. The applicant is recommended to submit biomarker analyses for 
MONARCH 2 and 3.

• 
The applicant references a murine xenograft model (Tate et. al. Clin Cancer Res 2014) as support for 
maintaining Cmin,ss  >200 ng/mL to suppress pRB/topo IIα and cell cycle progression. Whether this 
particular prediction of the referenced PK/PD model is supported also by observed data is not obvious. 
IHC of pRB/topo IIα were performed on skin biopsies available from a total of 180 patients enrolled in 
Study JPBA. The skin biopsies were collected prior to treatment initiation, as well as immediately 
predose and 4 hours postdose on Day 15 of Cycle 1. 
The skin biopsy data for pRB is very variable, but does perhaps lend some support to the threshold of 
200 ng/mL.

•  A daily dose of 225 mg achieved mean Cmin,ss of 54.7 ng/mL In order to achieve higher abemaciclib 
concentrations, a Q12H dosage regimen (75 mg to 275 mg) was subsequently tested, and at the MTD 
was identified as 200 mg Q12H (Cmin,ss 197 ng/mL). This rational for a two-dose regimen is not 
understood; the few patients assessed at 225 mg Q24H (n=3) and the PK of 150 mg Q24H suggests a 
chance finding. This is not pursued further as only Q12H dosing was investigated in confirmatory trials. 
•  During the dose-escalation phase of the study, 2 of the 3 patients who received abemaciclib 275 mg 
Q12H experienced DLTs of Grade 3 fatigue. At the next lower dose level (abemaciclib 200 mg Q12H), 
only 1 of 7 patients experienced a DLT. Therefore, the MTD of the study was set at 200 mg Q12H. This 
was the dose used in MONARCH-2 prior to protocol amendment a, where the dose was reduced to 150 
mg Q12H due to diarrhea causing dose reductions during cycle 1. 
Antitumor activity 
All efficacy analyses were performed on the 192 patients in the dose-confirmation phase (Parts B, C, D, E, F, and 
G) who had received at least 1 dose of abemaciclib.

In this study, 3 dose levels were investigated (100, 150, and 200 mg administered every 12 hours [Q12H]) in 
Japanese patients with advanced cancer. Dose escalation proceeded, in cohorts of 3 to 6 patients, based on the 
frequency of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed in Cycle 1 until either ≥33% of patients in 1 cohort 
experienced DLT or the planned highest dose level was reached. 
Results 
The numbers of patients exposed to different doses in the respective parts of the study are tabulated in section 
3.3. 
•  One patient in 6 (16.7%) at 200 mg Q12H experienced DLT of nausea (Grade 2; upgraded to 3 and 
considered to be a DLT) during Cycle 1, which required a dose omission of more than 25% of the planned 
dose.

• 
PK data derived from few patients, and high exposures (600-800 ng/mL) at steady state for doses 100 
mg and 150 mg Q12H are considered chance findings with high exposures for one individual in each 
group. 
•  As in JPBA, pRB by IHC in skin biposies tends to be lower at day 15. Acknowledging the limitation in 
numbers. 
• 
There were no responses (CR or PR) observed in Study JPBC. In the 200 mg Q12H cohort, 1 patient was 
observed to have SD for a disease control rate of 16.7% and 5 patients experienced PFS events with a 
median of 1.6 months.

adequate tumor assessment, as was progression or death after ≥ 2 missing evaluations. 
•  Secondary objectives: OS; OS rate at 1, 2 and 3 years; ORR; DoR, disease control rate, clinical benefit 
rate (CR+PR+SD ≥ 6 months); safety and tolerability; change in symptom burden from baseline by 
EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-BR23 (breast) and EQ-5D-5L; the PK of abemaciclib, its metabolites, and 
NSAI therapy. 
• 
Exploratory objective: to explore change in tumor size. 
The Applicant should a provide timeline when biomarkers analyses (exploratory objectives) will be available. 
Two PFS analyses (after 189 and 240 PFS events) and five OS analyses (also after 189 and 252 OS events, final 
after ≥ 315 OS events and  ≥ 189 OS events in visceral disease patients) were planned.

The graphical method of Maurer and Bretz (2013) to control the overall type I error rate at 0.025 (one-sided) or 
equivalently, 0.05 (two-sided) was used: 
Patients were randomized 2:1 and randomization was stratified by nature of disease (visceral metastases vs 
bone-only metastases vs other) and prior (neo-) adjuvant endocrine therapy (AI vs other vs none). 
Recruitment and patient disposition 
A total of 579 patients entered the study (signed the ICF) at 158 sites in 22 countries. 
European patients amounted to 53%, Asian to 29%, and North American to 18%. 
The first patient was enrolled 18 November 2014, the last in November 2015, data cutoff date for the interim 
analysis was 31 January 2017. The final PFS analysis with a data cutoff date 3 November 2017 was also

Baseline data 
Baseline demographic characteristics, including age, race, ethnicity, region, and ECOG performance status were 
balanced. 
All 493 enrolled patients were female, and the majority were Caucasian (58%) or Asian (30%). The median age 
was 63 years (range: 32 to 88 years), 60% had a baseline ECOG PS of 0, and 40% had a baseline ECOG PS of 
1. 
Baseline disease characteristics, including time since diagnosis, histology, disease stage, histopathological 
grade, HR- and HER2 status were balanced. 
Four-hundred and ninety-two patients (99.8%) had HR+ disease, including 77% with ER+/PgR+ disease, 22% 
with ER+/PgR- disease, 0.8% with ER+/PgR unknown, and 0.4% with ER-/PgR+. A total of 492 patients 
(99.8%) had HER2- disease.

events (50%), 138 (42%) in the experimental vs. 108 (66%) in the control arm. The medians were 28 vs. 15 
months, HR 0.54, p= 0.000002. Results were consistent with independent review (NR vs. 19 months, HR 0.46) 
and the interim (primary) PFS analysis.

Forest plot of summary of progression-free survival by additional subgroups of interest, 
intent-to-treat population – MONARCH 3 final PFS cutoff. 
Among the exploratory subgroups, a more limited benefit was noted from the combination treatment for 
patients with longer DFI (≥36 months). A prolonged treatment-free interval is considered a predictor of 
response to hormone therapy (Johnston, 2010), hypothetically explaining a lack of benefit from the addition of 
abemaciclib. Patients with DFI ≥36 months and < 36 months were further divided into subgroups on the basis 
of whether the diagnosis was made in primary or metastatic tissue, with the hypothesis that primary tissue may 
become less relevant with time, but results were inconclusive due to small numbers.

Time to Second Disease Progression 
The second objective disease progression date was not collected in the MONARCH 3 trial. Therefore, the second 
objective disease progression date was replaced with the discontinuation date of next line (first line of post 
discontinuation) treatment or starting date of the second line of post-discontinuation treatment, whichever was 
earlier.

Study participants 
Key inclusion criteria 
• 
• 
Female, ≥ 18 years, ECOG ≤ 1, postmenopausal status due to a GnRH agonist or natural/surgical causes 
(age ≥ 60 or; age ≤ 60, amenorrhea and FSH + estradiol in postmenopausal range or; bilateral 
oophorectomy). 
Positive for ER and/or PgR by immunohistochemistry (IHC) according to ASCO guidelines (Hammond 
et.al 2013). 
•  Not positive for HER2 by IHC or in-situ hybridization according to ASCO guidelines (Wolff et.al 2013). 
• 
Locoregional or metastatic disease not amenable to curative surgery. 
•  Relapse/progression while receiving or within 1 year of completing (neo) adjuvant endocrine therapy, 
no subsequent endocrine therapy. 
•  Relapse after 1st line metastatic treatment with an anti-estrogen or aromatase inhibitor, no 
chemotherapy in the metastatic setting. 
• 
 By RECIST 1.1: measurable or non-measurable bone-only disease. 
Key exclusion criteria 
•  Visceral crisis, lymphangitic spread, CNS metastasis, or inflammatory breast cancer. 
• 
Previous non- (neo) adjuvant chemotherapy, fulvestrant, everolimus or CDK4/6 inhibitor, initiated 
bisphosphonates or RANK-L targeted agent <7 days prior to randomization. 
The Applicant should clarify whether there were patients who started with bone-modifying agents while study 
treatment was ongoing. 
Objectives and endpoints 
• 
Primary objective: PFS by investigator 
PFS was censored at date of randomization if baseline or post-baseline assessments were missing (and 
the patient had not died). Loss to follow-up or withdrawal of consent was censored at date of last 
adequate tumor assessment, as was progression or death after ≥ 2 missing evaluations. 
•  Secondary objectives: OS; OS rate at 1, 2 and 3 years; ORR; DoR, disease control rate, clinical benefit 
rate (CR+PR+SD ≥ 6 months); safety and tolerability; pain and symptom burden using the Brief Pain 
Inventory (BPI), EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BR23 (breast) questionnaires, EQ-5D 5L; the PK of 
abemaciclib, its metabolites, and fulvestrant. 
Two PFS analyses (after 265 and 378 PFS events) and four OS analyses (also after 331 and 441 OS events) were 
planned. 
To control the type I error rate at a one sided p of 0.025, the p-value of 0.00001 was specified for the interim PFS 
analysis, with alpha 0.2499996 remaining for the final PFS analysis. OS was to be controlled hierarchically, with 
alpha-spending between the respective OS analyses determined by an O’Brien-Fleming type stopping boundary. 
Patients were randomized using the following stratification factors: nature of disease (visceral metastases vs 
bone-only metastases vs other) and sensitivity to endocrine therapy (primary resistance vs secondary 
Assessment report  
EMA/551438/2018 
Page 72/133 
  
  
resistance, i.e. progression within 2 years of adjuvant treatment or within 6 months of advanced treatment 
defining primary resistance vs. not fulfilling these criteria). 
Recruitment and patient disposition 
A total of 855 patients entered the study (signed the ICF) at 145 sites in 19 countries. The geographic 
distribution of patients was Europe 42%, Asia 32%, North America 27%. 
The first patient was enrolled 7 August 2014; the last patient 29 December 2015, data cutoff was 14 February 
2017. 
Baseline data 
Demographic characteristics were balanced between treatment arms. All 669 enrolled patients were female, and 
the majority were white (56%) or Asian (32%). The median age was 60 years (range: 32.0 to 91.0 years). Sixty 
percent of patients had a baseline ECOG PS of 0, 40% a PS of 1. The majority of patients (82%) were 
postmenopausal. Seventeen percent were pre/peri-menopausal (i.e., received ovarian suppression with a GnRH 
agonist). 
Assessment report  
EMA/551438/2018 
Page 73/133 
  
  
 
Baseline disease characteristics, including duration of disease, histopathological grade, and stage were 
balanced. Hormone positivity was a s follows: 75% ER+/PgR+, 21% with ER+/PgR-, and 2.4% with ER+/PgR 
unknown, and 1.2% with ER-/PgR+.

The investigator-to-independent review discordance in progression calls was large. The anatomical sites of 
progression were investigated and, not unexpectedly, discrepant calls were often the case for skeletal lesions, 
whereas calls were concordant for liver lesions.

Time to Second Disease Progression 
The second objective disease progression date was not collected in MONARCH 2 trial. Therefore, the second 
objective disease progression date was replaced with the discontinuation date of next line (first line of post 
discontinuation) treatment or starting date of the second line of post-discontinuation treatment, whichever was 
earlier.

MONARCH 2: Endocrine-Therapy Naïve Population (Abemaciclib plus Fulvestrant as Initial 
Endocrine-Based Therapy) 
The original MONARCH 2 protocol allowed patients who presented de novo with locally advanced/metastatic 
disease and not received any prior endocrine therapy (endocrine-naïve, EN). 
Assessment report  
EMA/551438/2018 
Page 80/133 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Applicant provided the efficacy and safety data from the initially enrolled post-menopausal EN population 
from the MONARCH 2 study (44 patients), which have been analysed separately and not included in the ITT 
population, to support the inclusion of the combination of abemaciclib and fulvestrant as initial endocrine-based 
therapy in the indication.   
Numbers analysed: A total of 44 patients were randomized 2:1, 28 in the abemaciclib plus fulvestrant arm and 
16 in the placebo plus fulvestrant arm (1 patient in the abemaciclib arm was not treated).  
Baseline data: All patients were female, the majority were Caucasian (61.4%), and the median age was 59.5 
years (range 36 to 79 years). The majority of patients (61.4%) had a baseline ECOG PS and the majority were 
postmenopausal (81.8%).  
Treatment: 78% patients in the abemaciclib plus fulvestrant arm received abemaciclib at a starting dose of 200 
mg Q12H. However, the median dose intensity in the EN population was only slightly higher compared to the EP 
population (283.4 vs 273.1 mg/day), therefore this is not considered an issue.

Secondary objectives: OS, DoR, PFS, modified Brief Pain Inventory–Short Form (mBPI-sf) and EORTC 
QLQ-C30. 
In the investigator assessment, the median time to response was 3.7 months (range: 1.1 to 14 months). Of the 
26 patients in MONARCH 1 with a PR as assessed by the investigator, 16 progression events and 1 death were 
observed. The median DoR was 8.6 months (95% CI: 5.8, 10).  
PFS by investigator 
OS 
In support of PFS, the applicant analysed time-to-progression on last prior chemotherapy. This was derived for 
130 patients using the progression date recorded in the case report form (CRF), or the end date of the treatment 
when not reported (in 10 patients). The median TTP on the last prior chemotherapy was 6.6 months with an 
interquartile range of 3.5 to 11.1 months. Further analyses were performed, indicating that the PFS (but not 
ORR) was similar in patients with long or short TTP on last prior chemotherapy. Although the comparison to last 
prior therapy is considered interesting, and potentially providing an internal control for the PFS result, findings 
are not reassuring and do not outweigh the modest response rate and uncertainties identified. 
Secondary objectives: modified Brief Pain Inventory–Short Form (mBPI-sf) and EORTC QLQ-C30. 
The applicant has made no overall interpretation of the mBPI-sf of EORTC QLQ-C30 findings. 
Comparison to the Flatiron Health database.  
In order to place the MONARCH 1 OS data in clinical context, OS results from a retrospective cohort study using 
observational data from the Flatiron Health EMR database for patients with mBC are presented. The Flatiron 
Metastatic Breast Cancer Cohort includes more than 15,000 patients (as of 28 February 2018) with mBC. It is 
part of a broader longitudinal database containing electronic health record data from over 265 cancer clinics 
representing approximately 800 sites of care across the US. 
The Flatiron cohort includes patients with a mBC diagnosis from 01 January 2011 to 28 February 2018.  To 
provide the most relevant comparator to MONARCH 1 patient population, the following entry criteria are used: 
•  mBC patients with hormone receptor positive (HR+) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
negative (HER2-) with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1

received monotherapy with capecitabine, gemcitabine, eribulin, or vinorelbine.  These agents were selected 
based on ESMO and NCCN guidelines for sequential single-agent chemotherapy for patients in this setting  
received at least 1 but no more than 2 lines of chemotherapy in the metastatic setting prior to receipt of the 
single-agent chemotherapies listed above.  Patients who received CDK4 and CDK6 drugs (for example, 
palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib) in prior lines of therapy will be excluded. 
Patients were further matched on age group, race group, number of prior chemotherapies in the metastatic 
setting, number of prior endocrine therapies in the metastatic setting, prior capecitabine use, and progesterone 
receptor status, utilizing the Mahalanobis distance matching method (Rubin 1980).

It is entirely unclear whether this is representative of the difference in OS that would be seen in a randomized 
comparative trial. In the current disease setting, with an ORR of 20%, the numerical OS difference compared to 
external data is considered a critically uncertain evidence of clinical benefit. 
The Applicant proposed to initiate a Phase 3 study of abemaciclib versus physician’s choice single-agent 
chemotherapy as a post-authorisation measure for the monotherapy indication. However, the feasibility of the 
proposed study is questioned after the approval of abemaciclib monotherapy.

2.9.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The overall design of the randomized, active-controlled studies MONARCH-3 and MONARCH-2 was acceptable. 
Patient populations in the randomized trials, as identified by eligibility criteria, were relevant to the respective 1st 
advanced line indication of abemacilib as add on to a non-steroidal AI, and the 2nd line indication as add-on to 
fulvestrant. The chosen comparators were appropriate, in keeping with international guidelines.  
In advanced breast cancer, prolonging survival and alleviating disease symptoms are relevant aims of therapy. 
Cure is not expected. Although OS is the most persuasive endpoint, PFS is an acceptable primary endpoint.  
Foreseeable benefits of the PFS gain include delayed symptomatic deterioration, postponed chemotherapy, and 
extension of life span provided no disease-modifying effects of abemaciclib beyond discontinuation. Such an 
effect has been discussed for CDK 4/6 inhibitors; some practitioners have reported fast disease progression 
upon drug withdrawal. Therefore, in the absence of mature OS data, PFS 2, TFST and TSST are considered 
important supporting evidence. In relation to scientific advice sought (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/140264/2014), the 
CHMP highly recommended analysis of PFS2. During the procedure, the applicant submitted analyses of time to 
the earlier of next line discontinuation/start of 2nd next line treatment, which in view of findings was considered 
an acceptable surrogate provided subsequent submission of final OS data. The Applicant is recommended to 
submit interim and final OS data.

Both Study I3Y-MC-JPBM (Monarch 3) and Study I3Y-MC-JPBL (Monarch 2) were double-blind. Considering e.g. 
the frequently reported occurrence of diarrhoea, performing blinded independent central review (BICR) of scans 
rather than on a subset (as initially planned) is endorsed. 
Both Study I3Y-MC-JPBM and Study I3Y-MC-JPBL had a 2-look group-sequential design of the primary endpoint 
of investigator-assessed PFS. The approach to handle multiplicity taking into account repeated analyses over 
time and the importance of the key secondary endpoint of OS seems appropriate. 
Study I3Y-MC-JPBM (Monarch 3), was planned to enrol approximately 450 patients, 300 patients in the 
abemaciclib plus NSAI arm and 150 patients in the placebo plus NSAI arm. Initially, the sample size estimation 
was based on a hazard ratio of 0.714. Per protocol amendment (a), the number of events required was 
decreased from 312 to 270 and the assumed hazard ratio was changed to 0.67. With protocol amendment (b), 
the number of events was further decreased (from 270 to 240) based on recent Phase 3 study disclosures (Finn 
et al. 2016; Hortobagyi et al. 2016; PALOMA 2 and MONALEESA 2) indicating that the combination of a 
non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor and an inhibitor of CDK4 and CKD6 may be highly efficacious. This is endorsed 
considering both the fairly limited original sample size, the 2:1 randomisation and that the changes made were 
justified by the belief in a larger difference between treatments than initially assumed. 
Study I3Y-MC-JPBL (Monarch 2) was to enrol approximately 550 patients in two strata of patients according to 
prior endocrine therapy: endocrine therapy pretreated (EP) patients and endocrine therapy naïve (EN) patients. 
Per amendment (a) the starting dose of blinded study drug was changed from 200 mg Q12H to 150 mg Q12H. 
Following this dose change the study was modified to focus the study objectives on the EP strata; the inclusion 
of endocrine therapy naïve (EN) patients was removed and enrolment to the study was to continue until 450 EP 
patients had been enrolled at a starting dose of 150 mg Q12H. This was the approximate target number of EP 
patients at the planning stage of the study. The revised definition of the ITT population excluded only those 
patients previously randomised within a specific randomisation stratum. As a result, the treatment balance was 
preserved within the revised ITT population and remained balanced also with respect to the other stratification 
factor (nature of disease). 
For both studies, the statistical analysis plan was overall acceptable. Generally, commonly expected methods 
were used. Pre-specified PFS censoring rules implied censoring “only” if baseline or post-baseline data was 
missing, a patient was lost to follow-up or in case of no event. Data from a patient was also to be censored if 
documented progression or death occurred after two or more missed consecutive post-baseline tumour 
assessments. This approach may suggest the planning of a sensitivity analysis taking all events into account 
irrespective of when they occurred. No such analysis was planned nor has been performed (irrespective of 
study; this concerned only a few patients). Several (other) sensitivity analyses using different censoring rules 
were however planned and performed (same in both studies). 
In both studies, a number of changes to the analyses were implemented. These changes were stated to have 
been based on external data, thus no concern is raised. They further derived from updates to the OS analysis 
plan. In Study I3Y-MC-JPBM, specifically, the pooled (JPBL and JPBM) overall survival analysis was reclassified 
as an exploratory analysis and a visceral disease (VIS) population was defined with the gated analysis of OS 
updated to split alpha between the ITT population and the population of patients with visceral disease at 
baseline. 
The design of the single-arm study I3Y-MC-JPBN is overall acceptable as an exploratory study. In scientific 
advice, it was discussed as pivotal in the context of conditional approval (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/140264/2014).

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In MONARCH-3 (I3Y-MC-JPBM), the pre-planned interim analysis was performed with a data cut-off point being 
approximately 189 investigator-assessed PFS events (31 Jan 2017). The final analysis was conducted when 246 
investigator-assessed PFS events had been observed (3 Nov 2017).  
At interim, the median was not reached (NR) vs. 15 months in abmaciclib + NSAI vs. placebo + NSAI, HR 0.54 
(p = 0.000021) for PFS by investigator, with an event rate of 32% and 52% for the experimental and control 
arms, respectively. The PFS finding was supported by independent review and in sensitivity analyses, and 
further by an ORR of 48% vs. 35%, OR 1.8 (nominal p= 0.002) in favor of abemaciclib. The final analysis was 
consistent, with 28 vs. 15 months duration, HR 0.54 (p = 0.000002) for PFS by investigator, with an event rate 
of 42% and 66%. 
The time to the earlier of next line discontinuation/start of 2nd next line treatment (PFS 2 surrogate) was 31 vs. 
28 months in abmaciclib + NSAI vs. placebo + NSAI, HR 0.74 (p = 0.043), with an event rate of 33% and 45% 
for the experimental and control arms, respectively. The median difference of 2.7 months was poorly 
representative for the overall effect (~10 months may be a better representation given the HR of 0.74). 
For OS, the median was NR vs. NR, HR 0.97 (p= 0.92), with an event rate 9.8% vs. 10% at interim PFS, and NR 
vs. NR, HR 1.1 (p= 0.80), with an event rate 19% vs. 18% at final PFS analysis. 
Based on the data provided on patient reported outcomes, it is noted that the addition of abemaciclib to 
hormonal treatment is affecting patients mostly due to diarrhoea. However, global health status was similar at 
baseline in both arms and no significant difference was evident throughout the treatment. 
In MONARCH-2 (I3Y-MC-JPBL), the criteria for a positive study were not met at the PFS interim analysis and the 
final analysis of PFS was performed (submitted within this application). The sponsor remained blinded to the 
interim results and was not unblinded until the primary analysis of PFS. No changes to the analyses were made 
between the interim and the final analysis of PFS. 
The median PFS was 16 vs. 9.3 months in abmaciclib + fulvestrant vs. placebo + fulvestrant patients, HR 0.55 
(p = 0.0000001), with an event rate of 50% vs. 70%. The PFS gain is clinically relevant, and the PFS finding was 
supported by independent review and in sensitivity analyses, and further by an ORR of 35% vs. 16%, OR 2.8 
(nominal p< 0.001) in favor of abemaciclib.  
The time to the earlier of next line discontinuation/start of 2nd next line treatment (PFS 2 surrogate) was 23 vs. 
21 months in abmaciclib + fulvestrant vs. placebo + fulvestrant, HR 0.78 (p = 0.050, with an event rate of 37% 
and 44% for the experimental and control arms, respectively. 
For OS, the medians were NR vs. NR, HR 0.85 (p= 0.39), with an event rate 19% vs. 22%. 
Thus, overall survival data is immature with about 20% event rate in MONARCH 2 and 3. The post progression 
disease-course is probed in the time to the earlier of next line discontinuation/start of 2nd next line treatment 
analyses, and indicate a preserved positive effect. Final OS data is recommended to be submitted for 
confirmation. 
Global health status evaluated by EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire appeared similar between arms and stable 
throughout the treatment. The higher difference in global health status is seen at cycle 2 in favour of abemaciclib 
(possibly due to early diarrhoea), then the curves are overlapping. 
In MONARCH-1, the ORR was 20% (CI: 13.3 – 27.5), the CBR (≥ 6 months) 42%, PFS 6.0 months, and OS 22 
months.  
Assessment report  
EMA/551438/2018 
Page 97/133 
  
  
In planning MONARCH-1, an ORR of 15% had been identified as surpassing that of any agent used in this patient 
population; this lower bound was not met (ORR 20%, CI 13% - 28%). In scientific advice 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/140264/2014), the CHMP did not object to this boundary, but it was made clear that 
considering one single-arm phase 2 study to support approval (conditional was discussed), hurdles could be 
foreseen as results would have to be compelling and obvious to any qualified observer.  
External data forwarded by the MAH for contextualization was limited and heterogeneous, and offered an 
uncertain reference for the MONARCH-1 findings. Also, as notable add-on effects have been demonstrated with 
CDK 4/6 inhibitors also after progression on endocrine therapy, the proposed monotherapy indication appeared 
pharmacologically and clinically unjustified. A positive B/R could not be concluded for the proposed 
monotherapy indication. 
The extrapolation to AI + LHRH in premenopausal women can be accepted. Efficacy has been shown for 
abemaciclib in combination with AI in postmenopausal patients, and in combination with fulvestrant + LHRH in 
pre/perimenopausal patients, supporting the extrapolation. Furthermore, AI + LHRH constitutes an accepted 
alternative (to antioestrogens/SERMs) in premenopausal patients, including as first line therapy, according to 
current clinical practice and European and international therapy guidelines. Effective inhibition of ER signalling 
is achieved with AI or fulvestrant (+LHRH) alike, as this is the basis for anti-tumour activity of these compounds. 
This further supports that abemaciclib can be used as add-on, not only to fulvestrant +LHRH, but also to AI 
+LHRH. Efficacy of abemaciclib + fulvestrant in the endocrine-naïve population may be supported from use with 
fulvestrant in the second-line setting, and from combination with AI in first line. 
2.9.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The PFS benefit in 1st advanced line use of abemacilib as add on to a non-steroidal AI, and 2nd line use as 
add-on to fulvestrant is of clear clinical benefit. The applicant is recommended to submit remaining and final OS 
analyses as post-authorisation measures.  
The ORR seen in the single arm MONARCH-1 trial undertaken in a chemotherapy-experienced metastatic breast 
cancer population is not outstanding and clinical benefit has not been shown. The Applicant revised the 
indication to remove the monotherapy. 
2.10.  Clinical safety 
The safety database encompasses patients treated with abemaciclib in combination with AI in the MONARCH 3 
study (N=327), in combination with fulvestrant in the MONARCH 2 study (N=441) and as monotherapy in the 
MONARCH 1 study (N=132). Overall, approximately 900 patients have received abemaciclib in combination with 
endocrine therapy and 732 patients and healthy subjects received single-agent abemaciclib in 17 clinical trials. 
This safety assessment has focused on the three studies i.e. MONARCH 3, MONARCH 2 and MONARCH 1. 
MONARCH 3 (I3Y-MC-JPBM, abemaciclib plus AI) 
A 2:1 randomized, double-blind Phase III study evaluating abemaciclib with NSAI or placebo with NSAI as 1st 
line treatment in postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2- locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.  
Data cut-off date 03 November 2017 
Assessment report  
EMA/551438/2018 
Page 98/133 
  
  
The safety population included 488 randomized (327 patients in the abemaciclib + AI arm and 161 patients in 
the control arm). The investigator determined the specific AI (letrozole or anastrozole) to be administered to the 
patients. Approximately 80% of patients received letrozole and 20% received anastrozole. 
Patient exposure 
No difference is observed in terms of median number of cycles of abemaciclib received per patient (16 cycles) 
compared to the median number of cycles in the control arm (15 cycles). The duration of exposure is likely 
affected by the duration of follow-up up to the data cut-off date for this primary analysis (median ~18 months 
in both arms). In regard to dose intensity, the median and the mean for the experimental arm was 256 mg/day 
and 238 mg/day respectively compared to the control (295 mg/day and 285 mg/day). A difference in terms of 
relative dose intensity was also observed with a median of 85 % and a mean of 79 % for the experimental arm 
as compared to median 98 % and mean 95 % in the control arm thus indicating a lower tolerability for the 
investigational combination.  
Dose Adjustments and Omissions 
A total of 47 % and 7 % had dose reductions in the experimental arm and control arm respectively. About 25 % 
of the patients needed only one dose reduction whilst 21 % had two and few required three dose reductions. The 
majority was attributed to AEs (47 % in the experimental arm and 6 % in the control arm). AEs leading to 
abemaciclib dose reductions included mainly diarrhoea (14 %) and neutropenia (13 %).  
A total of 65 % had at least one abemaciclib dose omission with 60 % due to AEs. Of note, about 27 % needed 
≥ 3 dose omissions. The main overall cause was neutropenia (17 %) and diarrhoea (15 %).  
Adverse events 
ADR definition 
The criteria used in the assessment of MONARCH 3 safety data were as follows: 
1. p-value <.05 and odds ratio (OR)>1 (missing ORs are considered >1). An OR >1 indicates a higher incidence 
in the abemaciclib arm. 
2. OR ≥ 2 and abemaciclib incidence ≥ 1% before rounding and abemaciclib count ≥4 (missing ORs are 
considered >2). 
3. Abemaciclib incidence ≥10% before rounding and OR>1 (missing ORs are considered >1).

For contextualization, duration on therapy was similar between the experimental and control arm (16 and 15 
months respectively). A quite substantial difference in the proportion of patients experiencing Grade ≥3 AEs and 
SAE is observed in the experimental arm compared to the control arm (62 % versus 26 % and 31 % versus 17 
% in the respective arms) with the majority considered treatment related. On the other hand, this appears not 
to translate into treatment discontinuations of the same magnitude, which may point to a manageable safety 
profile with appropriate risk minimization measures. A discontinuation rate attributed to AEs of 17 % is 
considered acceptable.

Continued 
The most common TEAEs regardless of severity (by≥ 10% of the patients) in the experimental arm are 
diarrhoea (82 %), neutropenia (44 %), fatigue (41 %), nausea (41 %), anaemia (32 %), abdominal pain (31 
%), vomiting (30 %) and alopecia (28 %).  
Assessment report  
EMA/551438/2018

A  higher  percentage  of  TEAEs  considered  treatment  related  was  reported  for  patients  in  the  abemaciclib 
containing arm (95 %) compared to the control arm (57 %). 
Grade 3 TEAEs were reported for 169 patients (52 %) and Grade 4 TEAEs for 2 patients (7 %) including 
neutropenia (1.8 %), hyponatremia (~ 1 %), embolism (0.6%) and GGT increased (0.3 %).  
In contrast to the safety profiles of the two approved CDK4/6 inhibitors palbociclib (Ibrance) and ribociclib 
(Kisqali) where neutropenia was the most commonly reported AE (81 % [55 % Grad 3] and 74 % [60 % Grad 
3/4] respectively), with abemaciclib it is diarrhoea (82 % with ~10 % Grade 3) whilst neutropenia is reported to 
quite a lesser extent (4 % with 22 % Grade 3 and 2 % Grade 4). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
SAEs were reported in 102 (31.2 %) of the abemaciclib treated patients (compared to 27 (16.8 %) in the control 
arm). The most common reason for a SAE report in the abemaciclib containing arm was lung infection (4 % 
whilst none in the control arm) followed by embolism which accounted for 2.4 % in the experimental arm 
compared to 0.6 % in control arm. Anaemia was reported in 1.8%, and diarrhoea in 1.5 %. There were five (1.5 
%) SAE reports of acute kidney injury.  
Hospitalizations 
About 21 % of all patients in the safety population reported ≥1 hospitalization with the vast majority (21 %) due 
to TEAEs (78 patients [24 %] in the experimental arm and 23 patients [14 %] in the control arm). The most 
common TEAEs for abemaciclib-treated patients were lung infection (8 patients [~ 2 %]), embolism (7 patients 
[2 %]), and diarrhoea (4 patients [~ 1 %]).  
The median duration of hospitalization was 10 days (range 1 to 504) for the abemaciclib-treated patients and 6 
days (range 2 to 67 days) for the placebo-treated patients.  
Deaths 
Deaths on therapy or within 30 days of treatment discontinuation were reported for 15 patients (4.6%) in the 
experimental arm including 11 patients (3.4%) due to AEs and 4 patients (~1 %) due to study disease. The most 
common AE by preferred term resulting in death in the abemaciclib containing arm was lung infection (1.2 %) 
and embolism (2 patients [0.6 %]).  
A total of 74 deaths (15 %) occurred after 30 days of treatment discontinuation (14.7 % in the experimental arm 
and 16.1 % in the control arm). All these cases were attributed to study disease.

Continued 
The high incidence of laboratory abnormality reports of neutropenia, anaemia and thrombocytopenia reflects 
the CDK 4/6 inhibitor mode of action and thus is not unexpected. There are some differences in regard to 
electrolytes between the abemaciclib treated patients and patients in the control arm. Given the high incidence 
Assessment report  
EMA/551438/2018 
Page 103/133 
  
  
 
 
of diarrhoea and vomiting associated with abemaciclib treatment which may lead to dehydration, further details 
have revealed that in the majority of reports of ≥ 3 hyponatremia and ≥ 3 hypokalaemia a temporal association 
with diarrhoea, vomiting and with dehydration was demonstrated. 
Safety in special populations 
Gender 
N/A as all patients were females. 
Race 
There were in total 58.4 % Caucasian patients enrolled (56.6 % in the experimental arm and 62.1 % in the 
control arm) as compared to 30.3 % Asian patients (31.5 % and 28.0 % in the respective arms). Others were 
Black or African American (8 [1.6 %]), American Indian or Alaska Native (6 [1.2 %]). These numbers are 
however considered too limited to draw any conclusions.   
Overall, Asian patients experienced more TEAEs as compared to the Caucasian population which included 
neutropenia, anaemia, ALT/ AST increases (Grade≥3 neutropenia: 27.2% in Asian patients and 16.8% in 
Caucasian patients; Grade≥3 anaemia 9.7% and 3.8% respectively; ALT TEAEs: 12.6% in Asian patients, 3.2% 
in Caucasian patients; ALT laboratory abnormalities: 14.9% versus 2.9% in Caucasian patients; AST TEAEs: 
7.8% versus 1.6%; AST laboratory abnormalities: 9.9% versus 1.1% in Caucasian patients. However, a higher 
incidence in Caucasian patients (11.9%) compared to that of Asian patients (4.9%) were noted for events of 
Grade ≥3 diarrhoea. 
Age 
No relevant differences in the incidence of TEAEs of diarrhoea, neutropenia, increased liver enzymes or the 
overall infections and infestations SOC were observed between the age groups. Patients aged ≥ 65 years as 
compared to patients < 65 years reported however more lymphopenia (lymphocyte count decreased 57.9% 
versus 48.6%, respectively), thrombocytopenia (platelet count decreased across all grades 48.9% versus 
26.0% respectively), hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia, decreased appetite, and blood creatinine increased. 
Furthermore, an overall higher rate of events in the Infections and Infestations SOC in patients aged ≥65 years 
than in patients aged ˂65 years (50.0% and 40.8% respectively). The majority of events were low grade; ≥
Grade 3 infections occurred more frequently in patients aged ≥65 years (11.5%) than in patients aged ˂65 
years (5.6%). However, no particular infection drove this difference.

Safety in Special Populations 
MONARCH 3 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Fifty-four patients (17 %) in the abemaciclib arm discontinued study treatment due to AEs and 5 patients (3 %) 
in the control arm. AEs reported as the reason for study treatment discontinuation in > 1% of the patients in the 
abemaciclib arm were ALT increased and lung infection (6 patients [1.8 %] each), diarrhoea and embolism (4 
patients [1.2%] each).  
Of the patients who discontinued any study drug, 31 patients (9 %) in the abemaciclib arm first discontinued 
from abemaciclib treatment due to an AE and continued treatment with the NSAI.  
The proportion of discontinuation due to AEs does not raise any concern at this point. 
MONARCH 2 (abemaciclib plus fulvestrant) 
The Phase III MONARCH 2 study enrolled patients with HR+, HER2- mBC who had disease progression following 
endocrine therapy. A total of 664 patients were randomized in a 2:1 design with 441 patients in the 
experimental arm and 223 in the placebo arm.  
Assessment report  
EMA/551438/2018 
Page 105/133 
  
  
 
Notably, the original MONARCH 2 protocol was amended (JPBL[a]) to change the starting dose of blinded study 
drug (abemaciclib from 200-mg Q12H to 150-mg Q12H or placebo) in order to improve tolerability i.e. primarily 
diarrhoea occurring during the first treatment cycle, observed in blinded safety review of MONARCH 2 and in 
studies JPBA and JPBH. All ongoing 200 mg Q12H patients were shifted to 150 mg Q12H. 
Data cut-off date 14 February 2017 
Patient exposure 
Duration of therapy was longer in the experimental as compared to the control arm (13 months and 9 months 
respectively) with a median number of cycles of abemaciclib received per patient of 13 as compared to 9 cycles 
in the control arm. The median number of cycles of fulvestrant received per patient was 15 and 9 cycles in the 
respective arms. A difference in dose intensity between the two arms is observed (median 273 mg/day and 
mean 261 mg/day in the experimental arm versus median 298 mg/day and mean 309 mg/day in the control 
arm). 
Dose Adjustments and Omissions 
A total of 49.4 % had abemaciclib dose reductions with the majority due to AEs (189 patients [42.9%]). Most 
common AEs included diarrhoea (83 patients [18.8%]) and neutropenia (44 patients [10.0%]). About 58.0% 
had at least one abemaciclib dose omission with 51.9 % due to AEs which included diarrhoea (83 patients 
[18.8%]) and neutropenia (72 patients [16.3%]). It is noted that 21.1 % required ≥ 3 dose omissions. 
The median number of days that patients were treated with abemaciclib at 200 mg or 150 mg twice a day prior 
to discontinuation or dose reduction for any reason (including disease progression) was 34 days and 92 days, 
respectively.  For the overall safety population, the median number of days to the first dose reduction due to 
diarrhoea was 29 days.  The median number of days to the first dose reduction due to diarrhoea was 16.5 days 
and 38 days for patients treated with abemaciclib at 200 mg or 150 mg twice a day, respectively.

This is basically the same distribution as observed in MONARCH 3 suggesting that the safety profile of

TEAEs by Maximum CTCAE Grade Experienced by ≥ 10% of Population in Either Arm Preferred Term by Decreasing Frequency 
(All Grades) in the Abemaciclib Plus Fulvestrant Arm, Safety Population 
Continued 
The distribution and proportions of TEAEs including by severity is very similar to that observed in MONARCH 3. 
Most common TEAEs regardless of severity (by≥10% of the patients) in the experimental arm are diarrhoea (86 
%), neutropenia (46 %), nausea (45 %), fatigue (40 %), abdominal pain (35 %), anemia (29 %), leukopenia 
(28 %), vomiting (26 %), headache (20 %) and alopecia (16 %). Corresponding proportions in MONARCH 3 
were diarrhoea (81 %), neutropenia (41 %), fatigue (40 %), nausea (39 %), abdominal pain (29 %), anemia 
(28 %), vomiting (28 %), and alopecia (27 %).  
Assessment report  
EMA/551438/2018 
Page 108/133 
  
  
 
 
Grade 3 TEAEs were reported for 241 patients (55 %) and Grade 4 TEAEs for 26 patients (6 %) including 
neutropenia (3 %) and thrombocytopenia (1.4 %) in the MONARCH 2 study. 
Endocrine-Naïve Population 
The original MONARCH 2 protocol allowed patients who presented de novo with locally advanced or metastatic 
disease and not received any prior endocrine therapy. Based on regulatory advice from the FDA however, the 
protocol was amended to remove the endocrine therapy naive patients from the ITT population to reduce 
heterogeneity. A total of 43 patients were included (27 patients received abemaciclib plus fulvestrant and 16 
patients received placebo plus fulvestrant). It is recognised that overall, the safety profile of abemaciclib + 
fulvestrant in the endocrine-naïve population appears similar to the endocrine pre-treated population. Due to 
the limited sample size however, no detailed conclusions can be drawn.  Any major difference in terms of 
tolerability concerns for abemaciclib + fulvestrant given as 1st line or as 2nd line population is not anticipated.

Again the similarity with MONARCH 3 is recognised. About 22 % had ≥ 1 SAE in MONARCH 2 and 28 % in 
MONARCH 3. The number of reports is also similar in regard to embolism and diarrhoea.  
Hospitalizations 
A total of 117 patients (18 %) reported ≥1 hospitalization including 93 patients (21 %) in the experimental arm 
and 24 patients (11 %) in the control arm.  
The median duration of hospitalization was eight days and the median number of admissions per patient was 
one. The most common TEAEs leading to hospitalization for patients in the abemaciclib containing arm were 
dyspnoea (7 patients [~ 2 %]), embolism (6 patients [1.4%]), lung infection (5 patients [1 %]), and sepsis (5 
patients [1 %]).  
Similarity with MONARCH 3 is recognised. In MONARCH 3 a total of about 77 (16 %) reported ≥ 1 hospitalization 
(59 [18 %] in the experimental arm). Similarity is also observed in terms of reasons for hospitalization.  
Deaths 
Summary of Deaths on Therapy or Within 30 Days of Treatment Discontinuation, Safety Population 
Deaths on therapy or within 30 days of treatment discontinuation were reported for 14 patients (3 %) in the 
experimental arm including 9 patients (2 %) due to AEs and 5 patients (1 %) due to study disease. The most 
common AE by preferred term resulting in death in the abemaciclib containing arm was sepsis (0.7 %). The 
number of deaths due to AEs (2 %) does not per se raise concerns at this point.

The laboratory abnormalities as observed in MONARCH 2 are very much in line with those in MONARCH 3. 
Safety in special populations 
Gender 
N/A as this study enrolled exclusively women. 
Race 
There were in total 55.7 % Caucasian patients enrolled (53.1 % in the experimental arm and 61.0 % in the 
control arm) as compared to 32.1 % Asian patients (33.6 % and 29.1 % in the respective arms). Others were 
Black or African American (14 [2.1 %]), American Indian or Alaska Native (25 [3.8 %]).  
As observed in MONARCH 3, Grade≥ 3 neutrophil count decreased and Grade≥ 3 neutropenia was higher in 
Asian patients than in non-Asian patients (neutrophil count decreased: 50.4% in Asian patients and 24.3% in 
non-Asian patients; neutropenia: 44.6% in Asian patients and 17.6% in non-Asian patients). Also Grade ≥ 3 
elevated hepatic transaminases was higher in Asian patients than in non-Asian patients (ALT TEAEs: 6.8% in 
Asian patients and 2.7% in non-Asian patients; ALT laboratory abnormalities: 7.6% in Asian patients and 2.7% 
in non-Asian patients; AST TEAEs: 4.7% in Asian patients and 1.1% in non-Asian patients; AST laboratory 
abnormalities: 6.9% in Asian patients and 1.9% in non-Asian patients). As opposed to the findings in MONARCH 
3, no major difference in the incidence of AEs of diarrhoea was observed. 
Age 
Overall, there is no major difference between patients < 65 (63.3) and ≥ 65 years (36.7 %) in terms of 
proportions of TEAE reports or according to severity.

MONARCH 2 
Discontinuations due to AEs 
Thirty-eight patients (9 %) discontinued study treatment due to AEs in the experimental arm and 7 patients (3 
%) in the control arm. The one AE reported in the abemaciclib containing arm as the reason for study treatment 
discontinuation for more than 1% of patients was diarrhoea (6 patients [1.4%]).  
The discontinuation rate is considered acceptable and raises no concern at this point. 
MONARCH 1 (JPBN.11.3, abemaciclib monotherapy) 
The MONARCH 1 was a Phase II, single-arm, open-label study in patients with HR+, HER2- mBC whose disease 
had progressed on or after prior endocrine therapies and who previously received at least two chemotherapy 
regimens, one of which was in the metastatic setting were enrolled (N=132).  
All enrolled patients were to receive 200 mg of abemaciclib orally BID on Days 1 to 28 of a 28-day cycle. The 
data cut-off date is 30 April 2016. 
Patient exposure

The median number of cycles received per patient was 5 and the median and mean duration of therapy was 
about five and 7 months respectively. The median dose intensity was 357 mg/day and median relative dose 
intensity was 89 %.  
Dose Adjustments and Omissions 
The vast majority (100 patients [76 %]) had at least one dose adjustment with close to 50 % requiring a dose 
reduction and 72 % requiring dose omissions. The main reason for dose adjustments was diarrhoea (27 patients 
[21 %] requiring dose reductions and 32 patients [24 %] dose omissions) and neutropenia (14 patients [10 %] 
requiring dose reductions and 21 patients [16 %] omissions). The need for dose reductions occurred mainly in 
association with the two first cycles. The median time to first dose reduction was 39 days.

All patients reported ≥1 TEAE with almost all considered treatment related (98 %). About 24 % of the patients 
were reported having ≥ 1 SAE. As observed in MONARCH 1 and 2, this did however not translate into a 
corresponding high rate of treatment discontinuations due to AEs (~7 %). 
Summary of TEAEs by Maximum CTCAE Grade experienced by ≥10% of the Population enrolled  
The most common TEAE associated with abemaciclib was diarrhoea which was reported in a substantial number 
of patients (89 % with 19 % Grade 3). Neutropenia is reported in 36 % with 19 % Grade 3 and 5 % Grade 4.

SAEs Preferred Term by Decreasing Frequency Enrolled Population 
Given the very high rate of diarrhoea occurring in the study population (90 % with 20 % Grade 3) it is noted that 
none led to a SAE (albeit that dehydration is likely to be a result thereof). The one case each of febrile 
neutropenia and sepsis is also noted.  
Hospitalizations 
A total of 22 % were hospitalized due to AEs. Most commonly was blood creatinine increased (2.3%) followed by 
abdominal pain, dehydration and embolism (2 patients [1.5 %] each).

Deaths 
Summary of Deaths Enrolled Population  
Two deaths occurred while on therapy, both due to AEs. In the case of the patient with sepsis, this was deemed 
related to procedure paracentesis with no evidence of neutropenia. In the case of pneumonitis, the investigator 
determined it to be possibly related to study drug. The majority of deaths either within or after 30 days of 
treatment discontinuation were attributed to the study disease.

Discontinuation due to AES 
Discontinuations from treatment due to AEs were experienced by 10 patients (7.6%) and included the following 
(1 patient each): abdominal pain, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased, blood creatinine increased, 
chronic kidney disease, diarrhoea, ECG QT prolonged, embolism, fatigue, hip fracture, and lymphopenia. 
Adverse Event of Special Interest (AESI)  
Neutropenia 
Neutropenia is a known adverse drug reaction of CDK 4/6 inhibitors due to their mode of action. It is evident that 
neutropenia is less of a concern for abemaciclib as compared to palbociclib and ribociclib (81 % [55 % Grad 3] 
and 74 % [60 % Grad 3/4] respectively). The incidences for abemaciclib treated patients in M3, M2 and M1 are 
43.7 % (22 % Grade 3; 1.8 % Grade 4), 46.0 % (23.6 % Grade 3; 2.9 % Grade 4) and 37.1 % (18.9 % Grade 
3; 5.3 % Grade 4) respectively. In terms of laboratory abnormalities, neutrophil count decreased were reported 
in 80.5 % (20.1 % Grade 3; 2.9 % Grade 4), 87.1 (28.6 % Grade 3; 3.5 % Grade 4) and 87.7 % (22.3 % Grade 
3; 4.6 % Grade 4) in M3, M2 and M1 respectively. 
The median time to onset of TEAEs of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was similar in all three studies (33, 29 and 29 
days in M3, M2 and M1 respectively). Median time to resolution of Grade ≥3 neutropenia was also similar (11, 
15 and 14.5 days in M3, M2 and M1 respectively). 
Neutropenia events leading to treatment discontinuations were in general low (3 %, 10 % and 24 % in the 
respective studies). The rather few occurrences of febrile neutropenia is also recognized (0.3 %, 1.4 % and one 
case in M3, M2 and M1 respectively).  
In M3 13 % experienced abemaciclib dose reductions and 17 % experienced abemaciclib dose omissions due to 
TEAEs of neutropenia.  About 3 % discontinued any study drug due to AEs of neutropenia (3 patients [0.9%] 
discontinued all study treatment, and 6 patients [1.8 %] discontinued only abemaciclib).In M2 the 
corresponding rates were 10 %, 16 % and about 2 %. In M1 11 % experienced dose reductions and 16 % 
experienced dose omissions due to TEAEs of neutropenia. 
Infections 
Infections occurring in the abemaciclib treated patients were reported in 45 % (5.5 % Grade 3; 1.5 % Grade 4) 
and 42.6 (5.0 % Grade 3; 0.7 % Grade 4) in M3 and M2 respectively. The most frequently reported were upper 
respiratory tract infection (~ 11 %), urinary tract infection (9 %), and lung infection (6 %).  In the M1 study 
infections were observed in 31.1% of the patients.  
SAEs were reported for 6.8 %, 5.9% and 4.5% of the patients in M3, 2 and 1 respectively and they were fatal 
for 4 patients in M3 (lung infections), 3 patients in M2 (2 sepsis, 1 lung infection) and 2 patients in M1 (1 sepsis, 
1 lung infection). TEAEs due to infections required discontinuation of study drug in 9 patients (2.8 %) in M3 
study (due to lung infections), in 7 (1.6%) patients in M2. 
In M3 there were four Grade 5 events of lung infection (two patients had normal neutrophil counts at the time 
of the event and one had Grade 1 neutrophil count). In M2 there were four fatalities including three due to sepsis 
and one case due to lung infection. 
Assessment report  
EMA/551438/2018 
Page 119/133 
  
  
 
The risk of infections including lung-infections associated with abemaciclib therapy is reflected in Section 4.4 of 
the SmPC.  Moreover, although the Applicant stated that a clear relationship between severe neutropenia and 
concurrent severe infection across studies has not been demonstrated, deaths due to infections/sepsis in the 
context of neutropenia were reported.  
Diarrhoea 
Diarrhoea is the predominant ADR associated with abemaciclib. In M3, M2 and M1 diarrhoea were reported in 
82.3 % (9.5 % Grade 3 [no Grade 4]), 86.4 (13.4 % Grade 3 [no Grade 4]) and 90.2 % (19.7 % Grade 3 [no 
Grade 4]) of the abemaciclib treated patients in the respective studies.   In M3 and M2 respectively , 13.8 % 
and 18.8% had dose reductions due diarrhoea whilst in M1 it was 21 %. Dose omissions were required in 15.3 
% and 18.8 % in M3 and M2 respectively. 
Reassuring is that few patients discontinued due to diarrhoea however the vast need for concomitant 
anti-diarrheals is recognized. It is also noted that a high proportion of patients continued to report diarrhoea all 
through subsequent treatment cycles. In M2, the median number of days that patients were treated with 
abemaciclib at 200 mg or 150 mg twice a day prior to discontinuation or dose reduction for any reason (including 
disease progression) was 34 days and 92 days, respectively.  For the overall safety population, the median 
number of days to the first dose reduction due to diarrhoea was 29 days.  The median number of days to the first 
dose reduction due to diarrhoea was 16.5 days and 38 days for patients treated with abemaciclib at 200 mg or 
150 mg twice a day, respectively. The median number of days to the first dose reduction due to any AE was 29 
days and 60 days for patients treated with abemaciclib at 200 mg or 150 mg twice a day, respectively. 
In M3, the median number of days to first dose reduction due to diarrhoea was 37.5 days, consistent with the 
observations in M2 for patients receiving a starting dose of 150 mg (38 days). 
The SmPC Sections 4.2 and 4.4 adequately reflects information on diarrhoea, including management and dose 
adjustment. 
Further to diarrhoea in terms of GI disorders, nausea and vomiting were frequently reported (in M3 41.3 % 
and 30.3 % respectively and in M2 45.1 % and 25.9 % respectively). In M1 it was even higher likely due to the 
higher dose (nausea 64.4, vomiting 34.8 %). Reports for decreased appetite are thus not unexpected (26.3 
%, 26.5 % and 45.5 % in M3, M2 and M1 respectively).  
Blood creatinine increased 
Laboratory abnormalities in terms of blood creatinine increased were commonly reported. In M3, M2 and M1 
the proportions were 98.1 % (2.9 % Grade 3 [no Grade 4]), 98.4 (1.2 % Grade 3 [no Grade 4]) and 98.5 (0.8 
% Grade 3 [no Grade 4]) in the abemaciclib treated patients in the respective studies.  The Applicant argues that 
in vitro and clinical data have showed that abemaciclib and its metabolites (M2 and M20) are inhibitors of the 
renal OCT 2, MATE1, and MATE2-K transporters. A clinical pharmacology study designed to investigate the 
effects of abemaciclib on renal tubular secretion and on GFR demonstrated that estimated GFR based on cystatin 
C is more consistent with actual GFR and that abemaciclib had no effect on GFR as measured by iohexol 
clearance (please refer also to the PK sections).  
Although it is recognized that the majority of reports constitutes isolated blood creatinine increases, acute 
kidney injury (AKI) was reported in about 2.8 % in M3 and 1.4 % in M2. A clear evidence of relationship 
between study drug and events of AKI is difficult to draw in these patients, due to the presence of confounding 
factors (e.g. previous or concomitant episodes of diarrhoea, nausea or vomiting, comorbidities or baseline 
elevated creatinine). A possible relationship cannot however, be completely excluded. The SmPC reflects the 
risk of dehydration secondary to diarrhoea.

EMA/551438/2018 
Page 120/133 
  
  
Hepatic events 
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased are commonly 
reported. In M3 and M2 ALT reports occurred in 53.4 (7.3 % Grade 3, 0.6 % Grade 4) and 41.0 % (3.9 % Grade 
3, 0.7 % Grade 4) in the abemaciclib treated patients respectively. For AST it was 44.4 % (5.1 % Grade 3 [no 
Grade 4]) and 37.4 % (3.9 % Grade 3 [no Grade 4]) in the respective studies. Blood bilirubin increased occurred 
in a reassuringly low proportion.  
In M3, reports of patients with ≥ 1 hepatic TEAE was 26.6 % of the abemaciclib treated patients mainly ALT 
increased 17.4 %, AST increased 16.8 %. Drug induced liver injury (DILI) occurred in two patients (0.5 %). In 
M2 it was 19.5 % and similarly mainly ALT increased 13.4 %, AST increased 12.2 %. There were no reports of 
DILIs. Two patients in M2 study dead due to hepatic failure and hepatic function abnormal.  There were no Hy´s 
Law cases identified. 
Management recommendations and warnings in regard to increased ALT and AST are reflected in in Sections 4.2 
and 4.4 of the SmPC  
The Applicant proposes to include `Liver injury´ as an important potential risk and a targeted follow-up for any 
AE of hepatobiliary disorders is included in pharmacovigilance activities in order to further characterize the 
potential risk of liver injury. This is considered acceptable. 
Venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) 
In M3 and M2 VTEs were reported in 6.1 % (1.5 % Grade 3, 0.6 % Grade 4) and 4.8 % (1.8 % Grade 3, 0.2 % 
Grade 4) of the abemaciclib treated patients as compared 0.6 % (no Grade 3, 0.6 % Grade 4) and 0.9 % (0.4 
% Grade 3 [no Grade 4]) in the respective control arms. Additionally, in M3 there were three patients (0.9%) 
with fatal outcome. The increased risk of venous thromboembolic events associated with advanced/ metastatic 
cancer in general and the risk associated with endocrine treatment is well recognised. The increase observed in 
the investigational arms compared to the control arm is however of concern and therefore VTE as an adverse 
drug reaction for abemaciclib is addressed in sections 4.4 and 4.8. VTE is also included in the safety specification 
in the RMP. 
No new concerns or signals have been identified in the requested safety updates of the AESIs (neutropenia, 
infections, diarrhoea, blood creatinine increased, hepatic events and VTEs). There is no evidence of any 
cumulative toxicity. 
Electrocardiograms 
QT prolongation is not considered an AESI of abemaciclib but relevant to comment. Preclinical, clinical 
pharmacology and clinical data has not revealed any clinically meaningful prolongation of QT/QTc interval by 
abemaciclib as opposed to, for example, ribociclib.  
Immunological events 
Not addressed in the dossier and will be not requested. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Drug-interaction studies were conducted with the CYP3A inhibitor clarithromycin (Study JPBE) in patients and 
the CYP3A inducer rifampin (Study JPBF) in healthy subjects.  Single doses of abemaciclib in both studies were 
Assessment report  
EMA/551438/2018 
Page 121/133 
  
  
generally well tolerated and the AE profiles were similar when abemaciclib was administered alone or with the 
coadministered drug. Abemaciclib should not be coadministered with inducers of CYP3A such as rifampin due to 
substantial reductions in abemaciclib and active metabolite exposure.   
No clinically significant interactions were observed between abemaciclib and loperamide, a P-gp substrate, 
indicating that loperamide can be safely administered with abemaciclib. 
Post-marketing experience 
On September 28 2017, abemaciclib in combination with endocrine therapy or as monotherapy, was approved 
by the FDA. There are no new concerns or signals evoked at this stage based on the post-marketing experience, 
however, the information is still very limited. 
2.10.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database encompasses patients treated with abemaciclib in combination with AI in the MONARCH 3 
(M3) study (2:1 design, N=327 and N=161 in the experimental and control arm respectively), in combination 
with fulvestrant in the MONARCH 2 (M2) study (2:1 design, N=441 and N=223 in the experimental and control 
arm respectively) and as monotherapy in the MONARCH 1 (M1) study (N=132).  
The safety profile of abemaciclib regardless of choice of endocrine partner or as monotherapy (the higher dose 
of 200 mg BID is recognized) as characterized in M3, M2  and M1  is very inter-study consistent. The vast 
majority reported ≥ 1 TEAE and a substantial rate of TEAEs ≥ 3 and SAEs were reported in the respective 
experimental arms. Notwithstanding, the low rate of treatment discontinuations due to TEAEs as reported in 
each study is considered reassuring. The number of deaths due to AEs does not evoke any concern at this point.  
Neutropenia 
Neutropenia is a known adverse drug reaction of CDK 4/6 inhibitors due to their mode of action. It is evident that 
neutropenia is less of a concern for abemaciclib as compared to palbociclib and ribociclib (81 % [55 % Grade 3] 
and 74 % [60 % Grade 3/4] respectively). The incidences for abemaciclib treated patients in M3, M2 and M1 
are 43.7 % (22 % Grade 3; 1.8 % Grade 4), 46.0 % (23.6 % Grade 3; 2.9 % Grade 4) and 37.1 % (18.9 % 
Grade 3; 5.3 % Grade 4) respectively. In terms of laboratory abnormalities, neutrophil count decreased were 
reported in 80.5 % (20.1 % Grade 3; 2.9 % Grade 4), 87.1 (28.6 % Grade 3; 3.5 % Grade 4) and 87.7 % (22.3 
% Grade 3; 4.6 % Grade 4) in M3, M2 and M1 respectively. 
Neutropenia events leading to treatment discontinuations were in general low (3 %, 10 % and 24 % in the 
respective studies). The rather few occurrences of febrile neutropenia is also recognized.  
Compared to palbociclib (Ibrance) and ribociclib (Kisqali), abemaciclib conveys a lesser risk of neutropenia, 
which appears to be well manageable with risk minimization measures as proposed in the SmPC. The Applicant 
proposed to include `Severe Infections secondary to neutropenia´ in the RMP which is supported.    
Infections 
Grade ≥3 occurring in the abemaciclib treated patients were reported in about 5.5 % of patients. Frequently 
reported were upper respiratory tract infection and lung infection.  In M3 there were four Grade 5 events of lung 
infection (two patients had normal neutrophil counts at the time of the event and one had Grade 1 neutrophil 
count). In M2 there were four fatalities including three due to sepsis and one case due to lung infection. 
Assessment report

Diarrhoea 
Diarrhoea is the predominant ADR associated with abemaciclib. In M3, M2 and M1 diarrhoea were reported in 
82.3 % (9.5 % Grade 3 [no Grade 4]), 86.4 (13.4 % Grade 3 [no Grade 4]) and 90.2 % (19.7 % Grade 3 [no 
Grade 4]) of the abemaciclib treated patients in the respective studies. Dose reductions due to diarrhoea were 
required in about 15-20% of the patients. Dose omissions were reported in similar percentages. 
Few patients discontinued due to diarrhoea, however the vast need for concomitant anti-diarrheals is 
recognized. It is also noted that a high proportion of patients continued to report diarrhoea all through 
subsequent treatment cycles.  
Different clinical trials have used different food recommendations and the Applicant states that there is no clear 
effect of food on the incidence of diarrhoea. A clinical study has however been requested by the FDA to evaluate 
the incidence of dose adjustments due to diarrhoea when abemaciclib is administered with or without food 
(estimated completion date December 2021). The Applicant is recommended to submit these results (Study 
I3Y-MC-JPCP) when available (around December 2021). Further to diarrhoea in terms of GI disorders, nausea 
and vomiting were frequently reported about 30 and 40%, respectively, in M1 at even higher frequencies, 
likely due to the higher dose. 
Blood creatinine increased 
Laboratory abnormalities in terms of blood creatinine increased were reported in close to all patients (98%), but 
Grade 3 in about 1-2% and no grade 4 events.  
Abemaciclib and its metabolites (M2 and M20) are inhibitors of the renal OCT 2, MATE1, and MATE2-K 
transporters and a study designed to investigate the effects of abemaciclib on GFR demonstrated that 
abemaciclib had no effect on GFR as measured by iohexol clearance (please refer also to the PK sections). 
It is recognized that the majority of reports constitutes isolated blood creatinine increases. Acute kidney injury 
was reported in about 2%, i.e. consistent with GI adverse effects.  
Hepatic events 
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increase and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increase are commonly 
reported, about 40-45% overall, Grade 3 about 5% and about 1% Grade 4.  Blood bilirubin increased occurred 
in individual patients.    
In M2, a total of 19.5 % of the patients reported ≥ 1 hepatic TEAE. The majority was ALT increased (13.4 %). 
Drug induced injury (DILI) and hepatic failure were reported two (0.5 %) patients each. For contextualization, 
ribociclib (Kisqali) approved in combination with AI, hepatobiliary toxicity events (including hepatocellular 
injury, drug-induced liver injury, hepatotoxicity, hepatic failure) occurred in 24.0% with 11.4% grade 3/4 
adverse events reported. Increases in transaminases were observed with Grade 3 or 4 increases in ALT (10.2%) 
and AST (6.9%).  
Management recommendations and warnings are reflected in Sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC for increased 
ALT and AST. The Applicant proposes to include `Liver injury´ as an important potential risk in the RMP which 
is supported.  
Venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) 
VTEs were reported in 5.3 % (1.7 % Grade 3, 0.3 % Grade 4) as compared with <1% overall in the control arms. 
Additionally, in M3 there were three patients (0.9%) with a fatal outcome.  
Assessment report  
EMA/551438/2018 
Page 123/133 
  
  
Whilst well recognizing the increased risk of venous thromboembolic events associated with advanced/ 
metastatic cancer in general and the risk associated with endocrine treatment, this increase (including fatal 
events) in abemaciclib treated patients is of concern. As abemaciclib treatment conveys an increased risk of 
VTEs this is reflected in Sections 4.4 and 4.8 in addition to be addressed in the RMP. 
No new concerns or signals have been identified in the requested safety updates of the AESIs (neutropenia, 
infections, diarrhoea, blood creatinine increased, hepatic events and VTEs) or in the data from the US 
post-marketing experience (albeit limited). There is no evidence of any cumulative toxicity. 
QT prolongation is not considered an AESI of abemaciclib, as abemaciclib appears not to prolong the QT 
interval to any clinically relevant extent. 
2.10.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profiles of the respective abemaciclib combinations as characterized in studies M3 and M2 are very 
similar suggesting that the safety profile of abemaciclib is not anticipated to alter to any major extent regardless 
of choice of accompanying endocrine therapy. The similarity to that of abemaciclib monotherapy is also 
recognized.  
In contrast to the two currently approved CDK4/6 inhibitors palbociclib (Ibrance) and ribociclib (Kisqali) where 
neutropenia was the overarching tolerability concern, with abemaciclib it is diarrhoea which requires a multitude 
of counter-acting measures including frequent dose reductions/omissions in order to be manageable. 
Neutropenia is much less of a concern. Notwithstanding, given the acceptable low treatment discontinuation 
rate, the overall abemaciclib toxicity appears to be manageable with appropriate risk minimization measures.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 0.4 is acceptable.  
2.12.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the 
Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The Applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 28.09.2017. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to 
determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.13.  New Active Substance 
The Applicant compared the structure of abemaciclib with active substances contained in authorised medicinal 
products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture of isomers, 
complex or derivative of any of them. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers abemaciclib to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
Assessment report  
EMA/551438/2018

2.14.  Product information 
2.14.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant 
show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of 
the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.14.2.  Labelling exemptions  
A request to omit all particulars from the immediate labelling has been submitted by the applicant and has been 
found unacceptable by the QRD Group for the following reasons: 
The product will be marketed as film-coated tablets supplied in blisters sealed in a wallet card. The company 
requested to omit printing of the minimum particulars on the blister foil as it will be extremely difficult for the 
patient to tear the wallet card apart and remove the blister. 
The QRD Group rejected the request to omit completely particulars on the blister foil since there is no guarantee 
that the blister cannot be separated from the wallet. The Group requested to have the minimum particulars to 
be printed on the blister foil as follows: Invented name, strength, INN, EXP and Lot. 
2.14.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Verzenios (abemaciclib) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as new active substance.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Verzenios is indicated for the treatment of women with hormone receptor (HR) positive, human epidermal 
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with an 
aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant as initial endocrine-based therapy, or in women who have received prior 
endocrine therapy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/551438/2018 
Page 127/133 
  
  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Breast cancer is estimated to cause about 500 000 deaths worldwide annually, and this is a consequence of the 
almost invariably fatal advanced disease setting relevant to the sought indication. For ER+, HER2-negative 
patients, the following treatment options pertain to the respective parts of the proposed indication: 
• First line endocrine therapy; aromatase inhibitors (AI), tamoxifen, fulvestrant, AI + CDK4/6 inhibitor, AI + 
everolimus (conditional on adjuvant AI). 
• Second line endocrine therapy; AI, tamoxifen, fulvestrant, fulvestrant + palbociclib, AI + everolimus, and 
megestrol acetate are options. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The two pivotal trials pertain to the respective parts of the proposed indication are: 
MONARCH-3: randomized 328:165 patients, double-blind, abemaciclib 150 mg BiD or placebo as add-on to 
non-steroidal AI in ER+ HER2- breast cancer, 1st line postmenopausal.  
MONARCH-2: randomized 446:223 patients, double-blind, abemaciclib 150 mg BiD or placebo add-on to 
fulvestrant (+GNRH agonist if not postmenopausal) in ER+ HER2- breast cancer with progression on endocrine 
therapy in the (neo) adjuvant (< 12 months) or metastatic setting. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
MONARCH-3: 
• 
PFS by investigator (primary endpoint), median 28 vs. 15 months in abemaciclib + NSAI vs. placebo + 
NSAI, HR 0.54 (p = 0.000002). Event rate 42% vs. 66%. 
•  ORR, 48% vs. 35%, OR 1.8 (nominal p= 0.002). 
•  OS, median NR vs. NR, HR 1.1 (p= 0.80). Event rate 19% vs. 18%. 
MONARCH-2: 
• 
PFS by investigator (primary endpoint), median 16 vs. 9.3 months in abemaciclib + fulvestrant vs. 
placebo + fulvestrant, HR 0.55 (p = 0.0000001). Event rate 50% vs. 70%. 
•  ORR, 35% vs. 16%, OR 2.8 (nominal p< 0.001).

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The respective safety profiles as characterized in studies MONARCH 3 (abemaciclib + AI, N=327) and 
MONARCH 2 (abemaciclib + fulvestrant, N=441) seems overall fairly consistent. 
Overall there is quite a substantial difference most and foremost in the proportion of patients experiencing 
Grade ≥3 AEs (58-68% of patients across studies) but also SAEs between the abemaciclib containing arms and 
the control with the majority considered treatment related. This however, does not translate into a 
corresponding magnitude regarding treatment discontinuations in either study and the number of deaths due to 
AEs does not evoke any immediate concerns at this point. Altogether, this may point to a manageable safety 
profile but not without appropriate risk minimization measures as nearly half of the patients across studies 
experienced a dose reduction due to AEs (mostly due to diarrhoea and neutropenia).  
Diarrhoea is the predominant abemaciclib ADR (reported by > 80 % across studies). Judging however by the 
fairly low proportion of abemaciclib treated patients that discontinued due to diarrhoea, this appears 
manageable albeit not without the requirement of appropriate measures like anti-diarrheals and dose 
adjustments. A high need of concomitant medications for the management of diarrhoea is evident including in 
patients with Grade 1 or Grade 2 events. It is further noted that a high proportion of patients continue to report 
events of diarrhoea all through the treatment cycles. 
Neutropenia is much less reported than with Ibrance and Kisqali and appears manageable considering the low 
proportion of treatment discontinuations and rather few events of febrile neutropenia/ neutropenic sepsis/ 
neutropenic infection.  A decrease in neutrophil counts is generally observed at Cycle 2 and maintained over the 
course of treatment. 
Other commonly reported TEAEs in the abemaciclib containing arms include fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, 
anaemia, vomiting and alopecia. 
Creatinine increase was reported in approximately 98% of the patients and occurred within the first cycle of 
abemaciclib dosing, remained elevated but stable through the treatment period and reversible upon treatment 
discontinuation. Abemaciclib and its metabolites (M2 and M20) are inhibitors of the renal OCT 2, MATE1, and 
MATE2-K transporters and a study designed to investigate the effects of abemaciclib on GFR demonstrated that 
abemaciclib had no effect on GFR as measured by iohexol clearance (please refer also to the PK sections). 
In terms of VTE events, there is an increase in reports (including fatal events) for the abemaciclib treated 
patients without any obvious difference in risk factors between the experimental arms and the control arms. The 
risk of VTE is reflected in the SmPC. 
Safety updates of AESIs (neutropenia, infections, diarrhoea, blood creatinine increased, hepatic events and 
VTEs) including  discontinuations due to AEs and permanent dose reductions for patients treated for < 12 
months, 12 to 18 months and > 18 months for the experimental and control arms, have been provided. For all 
AESIs the highest rate of TEAEs, severity (≥3) and the need for dose reductions occurred during the time period 
of 0-12 months which is likely to be indicative of adequate risk minimisation measures as proposed in section 
4.2. The discontinuation rate remains low over time of exposure. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Different clinical trials have used different food recommendations and the Applicant states that there is no clear 
effect of food on the incidence of diarrhoea. A clinical study has however been requested by the FDA to evaluate 
the incidence of dose adjustments due to diarrhoea when abemaciclib is administered with or without food. The

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The PFS gain in first advanced line use of abemacilib as add on to a non-steroidal AI compared to NSAI alone, 
and in the 2nd line population assessed in the fulvestrant add-on study, is comparable to results for approved 
CDK4/6 inhibitors and is considered a clinically meaningful benefit. 
The safety profiles of the respective abemaciclib combinations as characterized in studies MONARCH 3 and 
MONARCH 2 is very similar suggesting that the safety profile of abemaciclib is not anticipated to alter to any 
major extent regardless of choice of accompanying endocrine therapy. Diarrhoea requiring a multitude of 
counter-acting measures including frequent dose reductions/omissions in order to be manageable, is the 
overarching tolerability concern. No new concerns or signals have been identified in the requested safety 
updates or in the data from the US post-marketing experience (albeit limited). There is no evidence of any 
cumulative toxicity. It is concluded that the overall abemaciclib toxicity profile with appropriate risk 
minimization measures as reflected in the SmPC, appears to be manageable as evidenced by the low treatment 
discontinuation rate which remains low also over time of exposure. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The CHMP concludes that the magnitude of the treatment effect on progression-free survival and the 
manageable toxicity contribute to a positive B/R balance.

3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
For the indication abemaciclib + fulvestrant as initial endocrine therapy, the available evidence is limited, 
though the indication for first-line use can be supported by extrapolation from the demonstrated add-on effect 
to fulvestrant in the second line, in combination with evidence of efficacy in the first line in combination with AI. 
The extrapolation to AI + LHRH in premenopausal women can be accepted. Efficacy has been shown for 
abemaciclib in combination with AI in postmenopausal patients, and in combination with fulvestrant + LHRH in 
pre/perimenopausal patients, supporting the extrapolation. Furthermore, AI + LHRH constitutes an accepted 
alternative (to antioestrogens/SERMs) in premenopausal patients, including as first line therapy, according to 
current clinical practice and European and international therapy guidelines. Effective inhibition of ER signalling 
is achieved with AI or fulvestrant (+LHRH) alike, as this is the basis for anti-tumour activity of these compounds. 
This further supports that abemaciclib can be used as add-on, not only to fulvestrant +LHRH, but also to AI 
+LHRH.  
The ORR seen in the single arm MONARCH-1 trial undertaken in a chemotherapy-experienced metastatic breast 
cancer population is not outstanding and clinical benefit has not been shown. The Applicant revised the 
indication to remove the monotherapy. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Verzenios is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Verzenios is favourable in the following indication: 
Verzenios is indicated for the treatment of women with hormone receptor (HR) positive, human epidermal 
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with an 
aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant as initial endocrine-based therapy, or in women who have received prior 
endocrine therapy. 
In pre- or perimenopausal women, the endocrine therapy should be combined with a luteinising 
hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product Characteristics, 
section 4.2). 
Assessment report  
EMA/551438/2018 
Page 132/133 
  
  
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the 
list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any 
subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product within 6 
months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP 
presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being 
received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an important 
(pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that abemaciclib is a new active substance 
as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.

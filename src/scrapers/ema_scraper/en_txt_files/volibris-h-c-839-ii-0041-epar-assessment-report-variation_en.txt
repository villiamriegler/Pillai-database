Opinion 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Actual dates 
16 October 2015 
22 October 2015 
Ambrisentan (Volibris 5 and 10 mg film-coated tablets) is an endothelin receptor antagonist that is selective 
for the endothelin type A.  
In the European Union, the currently approved indication is as follows: "Volibris is indicated for the 
treatment of adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) classified as WHO functional class II 
and III, to improve exercise capacity (see section 5.1). Efficacy has been shown in idiopathic PAH (IPAH) and 
in PAH associated with connective tissue disease". 
On 11 April 2005, orphan designation (EU/3/05/273) was granted by the European Commission to Uppsala 
Medical Information System AB, Sweden, for ambrisentan for the treatment of pulmonary arterial 
hypertension and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. At the time of designation, pulmonary 
arterial hypertension and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension affected less than 2 in 10,000 
people in the European Union (EU). This was equivalent to a total of fewer than 93,000 people, and is below 
the ceiling for orphan designation, which is 5 people in 10,000. This is based on the information provided by 
the sponsor and the knowledge of the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP). 
This newly expanded therapeutic indication is based on data from the Phase 3/4 clinical study 
AMB112565/GS-US-300-0140 in subjects with WHO functional class (FC) II or III PAH. The study is named 
“AMBITION” and referred to as such hereafter. Efficacy and safety data are provided in support of the 
proposed prescribing information and patient information. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
Scientific advice from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) was requested by GSK for the development of 
ambrisentan, specifically relating to the design of the AMBITION study (08 February 2010). CHMP agreed 
that an event-driven study was an acceptable design for this registration study, and the planned statistical 
methodology was deemed acceptable. During the study, the sample size was adjusted to account for a lower 
than expected event rate and maintain study power, and the statistical analysis plan was adjusted to take 
into account EMA feedback. The CHMP did not endorse the Company’s strategy to base a claim on the 
combination of ambrisentan and tadalafil in comparison to the pooled monotherapy arms. In order to show 
a benefit of both components, two comparisons, one against each monotherapy arm, were needed 
(Procedure EMEA/H/SA/646/1/FU/1/2010/PA/II). The definition of the primary endpoint "clinical failure" 
was not entirely agreed, particularly the additional fourth component of “unsatisfactory long-term clinical 
response”) as proposed by the Company was not supported (Procedure 
EMEA/H/SA/646/1/FU/1/2010/PA/II).

Tabular overview of clinical studies  
The AMBITION study (n=605 patients) is the single pivotal study that provides clinical data in support of the 
new proposed indication for ambrisentan (Table 1). 
Table 1 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No new clinical pharmacology studies have been conducted to support the proposed new indication for 
ambrisentan. No new biopharmaceutical studies have been conducted to support the proposed new 
indication for ambrisentan, and no new formulation information is being submitted. The ambrisentan and 
tadalafil tablets used in the AMBITION study for which data are being submitted in this application were 
produced using the previously approved commercial formulations and processes.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main study 
AMBITION study 
The AMBITION study (n=605 patients) is the single pivotal study that provides clinical data in support of the 
new proposed indication for ambrisentan. This study was a Phase 3/4, randomized, double-blind, 
event-driven study designed to compare the safety and efficacy of initiating pharmacotherapy with a 
combination of ambrisentan and tadalafil to initiating pharmacotherapy with ambrisentan or tadalafil 
monotherapy at the same doses.  
Subjects were randomized 2:1:1 to receive combination therapy (ambrisentan and tadalafil), ambrisentan 
monotherapy, or tadalafil monotherapy (Figure 1). Ambrisentan was uptitrated from 5 mg OD (initial dose) 
to 10 mg OD (target dose) after 8 weeks, and tadalafil was uptitrated from 20 mg OD (initial dose) to 40 mg 
OD after 4 weeks if the therapy was well tolerated. All eligible subjects were to receive a minimum of 24 
weeks of therapy.

Study participants  
Inclusion criteria:  
The study enrolled adults (between 18 and 75 years of age, inclusive) with a diagnosis of IPAH/HPAH or PAH 
associated with connective tissue disease, drugs or toxins, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, 
or congenital heart defects repaired > 1 year prior to screening; current diagnosis of WHO FC II or III

symptoms; mPAP ≥ 25 mm Hg, PVR ≥ 300 dyne•sec/cm5, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) or 
left ventricle end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) ≤ 12 mm Hg if PVR ≥ 300 to < 500 dyne•sec/cm5, or 
PCWP/LVEDP ≤ 15 mm Hg if PVR ≥ 500 dyne•sec/cm5. The hemodynamic eligibility criteria specified here 
were part of the Amendment 2 changes to the protocol, which were implemented to reduce the likelihood of 
enrolling subjects with PH due to potential covert left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (WHO Group 2 PH). 
At the time the AMBITION study was initiated, the clinical classification of PAH was based on the Dana Point 
guidelines [Simonneau, 2009]. The recently updated PAH classification guidelines [Simonneau, 2013] are 
generally consistent with the Dana Point guidelines and resulted in no difference in the PAH classification of 
the study subject population (Group 1 PAH). 
Inclusion criteria were implemented to recruit patients in with a diagnosis of Group 1 PAH (IPAH/HPAH or 
PAH associated with connective tissue disease, drugs or toxins, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
infection, or congenital heart defects repaired) > 1 year prior to screening; current diagnosis of WHO FC II 
or III symptoms; and several haemodynamic criteria  to reduce the likelihood of enrolling subjects with PH 
due to potential covert left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (WHO Group 2 PH). 
Exclusion criteria were quite more extensive than the contraindications already included in the SmPCs of 
Volibris and Adcirca, as patients with risk factors for developing adverse reactions to ambrisentan were 
excluded (e.g.: anemia, fluid retention, retinal problems and baseline values of ALT and/or AST>2xULN). 
Sample size 
This event-driven study required 105 mITT subjects with an adjudicated clinical failure event in order to 
have approximately 97% power for the comparison of combination therapy with pooled monotherapy, and 
approximately 85% power for the comparison of combination therapy with individual therapy (i.e. either 
ambrisentan or tadalafil alone). A type 1 error rate (alpha level) of 5% (2-sided) was assumed in all power 
calculations for each of the three comparisons. 
Original sample size calculations were based on an overall event rate of 15% (a monotherapy arm event rate 
of 20% per year and a combination arm event rate of approximately 10% per year). These event rates 
equate to a hazard ratio of 0.47 (a 53% reduction in risk).  
Following a blinded review of the overall event rate after approximately 2 years of recruitment, the number 
of estimated adjudicated events was approximately 77% of the predicted overall event rate. Consequently, 
the overall event rate was re-estimated to be 12% per year. The sample size was re-estimated assuming an 
8% combination arm event rate and a 16% monotherapy arm event rate per year. The revised event rate 
estimates maintained the original estimate of a 53% reduction in the hazard ratio of combination therapy 
over monotherapy. 
Based on the recruitment rate at the time of re-estimation, a 148-week recruitment period and 175-week 
total study duration was estimated necessary to obtain 105 mITT subjects with a first event.  
614 subjects would need to be enrolled to obtain 520 mITT subjects (260 subjects in the combination 
therapy arm and 260 in the monotherapy arm [130 subjects receiving ambrisentan and 130 subjects 
receiving tadalafil]). To account for the loss of subjects, a drop-out rate of 5% per treatment group per year 
was assumed for these calculations. 
To evaluate the effects of ambrisentan on 6MWD at both maximum (peak) and minimum (trough) 
ambrisentan plasma concentrations, a test of the null hypothesis of no treatment group difference in change 
from Baseline to Week 16 in the 6MWD with 260 subjects receiving ambrisentan+tadalafil and 130 subjects 
receiving placebo+tadalafil yielded approximately 98% power assuming an average placebo-adjusted 
treatment effect of 30 m based on a 2-sample t-test and a standard deviation of 65 m.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/605025/2015 
Page 9/68 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Treatment effect and standard deviation were based on data from Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies of 
ambrisentan. Although the sample size was calculated using a 2-sided t-test, the specified analysis for this 
outcome used a Wilcoxon rank sum (WRS) test; therefore, the actual power may have varied slightly. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were assigned to study treatment in accordance with the randomization schedule, which was 
generated using the Sponsor’s randomization system.  
The randomization of eligible subjects was stratified based on the underlying etiology of PAH (idiopathic 
pulmonary arterial hypertension [IPAH]/heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension [HPAH] and non-IPAH) 
and WHO FC (II and III). The study was event-driven and, therefore, enrollment and study duration 
depended on the rate of study events. Enrollment of subjects continued up until 24 weeks prior to the 
anticipated 105th first clinical failure event in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT).  
Objectives 
The primary objective of this randomized, double-blind study was to compare 2 treatment strategies: 
first-line combination therapy (ambrisentan and tadalafil) versus first-line monotherapy (either ambrisentan 
or tadalafil) in subjects with PAH. This was assessed by comparison of time to the first clinical failure 
event. A Clinical Endpoints Committee (CEC) provided adjudication of all (first and subsequent) clinical 
failure events reported during the study. The CEC also reviewed all cardiopulmonary serious adverse events 
(SAEs) to ensure that no clinical failure events were missed. Members of this committee were blinded to 
treatment assignment and investigator. 
The secondary objectives were to compare the change in other clinical measures of PAH after initiating either 
first-line combination therapy or first-line monotherapy, in subjects with PAH. 
Additional objectives were to assess the safety and tolerability of first-line combination therapy compared 
with first-line monotherapy, and to assess the effect of plasma peak and trough ambrisentan concentrations 
on exercise capacity in subjects with PAH.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint:

Table 4. Definition of Clinical Failure Events 
Clinical Failure Events (all events adjudicated): 
Death (all-causea) 
Hospitalization for worsening PAH (adjudicated), which comprised any of the following: 
Any hospitalization for worsening PAH  
Lung or heart/lung transplant 
Atrial septostomy 
Initiation of parenteralb prostanoid therapy  
Disease progression (adjudicated), defined as follows: 
> 15% decrease from Baseline in the 6MWD combined with WHO class III or IV symptoms (at 2 consecutive 
postbaseline clinic visits separated by ≥ 14 days)  
Unsatisfactory long-term clinical response (adjudicated), which comprised all 3 of the following: 
≥ 1 dose of randomized treatment received and in the study for ≥ 6 months 
Decrease from Baseline in 6MWD at 2 consecutive postbaseline clinic visits separated by ≥ 14 days  
Assessment of WHO class III symptoms at 2 clinic visits separated by ≥ 6 months 
a. 
b. 
Cause of death was adjudicated into the following prespecified categories: 1. sudden cardiac death; 2. death from 
progressive heart failure; 3. pulmonary embolism; 4. death due to other cardiac causes; 5. death due to vascular 
causes (stroke); 6. death due to noncardiovascular causes; 7. cannot be determined. 
Parenteral prostanoids were defined as intravenous or subcutaneous formulations (ie, not inhaled). 
After screening and randomization assessments, subjects were assessed for efficacy and safety at Weeks 4, 
8, 16, 24, and every 12 weeks thereafter. Between clinic visits, subjects had monthly laboratory safety 
assessments.  
An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) monitored the safety and welfare of the study subjects 
and reviewed the accumulated data at regular intervals. They were to recommend continuation or early 
termination of the study based on the criteria defined in the IDMC charter. At no time did the IDMC 
recommend early termination of the study. The event rate was monitored during the study using blinded 
data. After approximately 2 years of recruitment, a blinded review showed that the overall observed event 
rate (adjudicated events plus events pending adjudication adjusted for concordance) was approximately 
77% of the original predicted overall 15% event rate (~12%). Consequently, the sample size was increased 
(from 456 to 520 subjects in the mITT population) to ensure 105 events; and to maintain power to detect a 
53% reduction in the hazard ratio (HR; 97% power for the combination versus pooled monotherapy 
comparison and 85% power for each of the combination versus individual monotherapy comparisons), with 
type 1 error rate of 5% for each of the 3 comparisons). 
The AMBITION study design took into account that following each subject’s Final Assessment Visit (FAV), 
investigators needed to make decisions regarding future treatment, and future treatment decisions would be 
informed by knowing to what treatment group subjects had been randomized.  
Therefore, investigators were unblinded at each subject’s End of Study (EoS) Visit (prior to the final 
database lock), so they could immediately provide the appropriate treatment for each subject on completion 
of the study. To accommodate the requirement to maintain the study blind for final efficacy and safety 
assessments and freeze the database before investigators were unblinded, the study included 2 database 
freeze points. The initial database freeze occurred after all FAV visits were completed and cleaned data was 
available. At that time, the database was frozen for each subject’s visit-based data through FAV, and 
investigators were not able to make any changes to the visit-based data through FAV unless a query had 
been raised by data management necessitating a change. Non-visit-based data such as adverse events

(AEs), SAEs, vital status, and clinical failure event data could be modified/added to by the investigator after 
the first database freeze.

Treatments 
Investigational products were ambrisentan, in the form of 5 mg tablets, or matching placebo; and tadalafil, 
in the form of 20 mg tablets, or matching placebo. 
Ambrisentan or Placebo:  
Ambrisentan: white, film-coated, immediate-release tablets containing 5 mg ambrisentan. 
Matching placebo tablets.  
Tadalafil or Placebo:  
Tadalafil: dark yellow tablet, containing 20 mg tadalafil.  
Matching placebo tablets  
Investigational product dosing: 
 The target doses of investigational product were 10 mg ambrisentan once daily and 40 mg tadalafil once 
daily (Table 3).  
Table 3. Investigational product dosing 
Treatment following a clinical failure event:  
Following the declaration of a clinical failure event by the investigator, investigators could assign the subject 
to blinded combination therapy (BCT) or add non-parenteral prostanoids (not provided by the sponsor) to 
their current therapy, if deemed appropriate. Investigators did not have to await outcome from the 
adjudication committee prior to initiating BCT or adding non-parenteral prostanoids. For the former option, 
subjects randomized to monotherapy had the other drug of the combination added to their medication 
regimen. Subjects randomized to combination therapy and uptitrated per protocol at Week 4 and Week 8 
effectively continued to receive blinded combination therapy, where no new drug was added to the subject’s 
medication regimen. Note that these interventions were optional and that the investigator did not have to 
choose either one.

Permitted Medications and Non-Drug Therapies:  
Standard medical treatment(s) taken by the subject upon study entry were permitted to be maintained 
throughout the study. Coadministration of tadalafil with alpha blockers was permitted, with caution 
exercised due to the possibility of additive effects on blood pressure. It was recommended that subjects 
participating in the study limit alcohol consumption [per the Adcirca USPI, 2014]. 
Drugs prohibited while receiving investigational product:  
1) Other ERAs (such as Bosentan [Tracleer] and Sitaxentan [Thelin]); 2) Commercial ambrisentan (Volibris 
or Letairis); 3) Inhaled nitric oxide; 4) Intravenous inotropes (e.g., dopamine, dobutamine); 5) PDE-5i (such 
as sildenafil [Revatio or Viagra] and vardenafil [Levitra]); 6) Commercial tadalafil (Adcirca or Cialis); 7) Any 
other investigational therapy; 8) All forms of prostanoids were prohibited unless the investigator determined 
the subject met the definition of clinical failure; 9) Nitrates; 10) Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., protease 
inhibitors, systemic ketoconazole, or systemic itraconazole); 11) Potent inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., 
rifampicin); 12) Cyclosporine A (except ophthalmic formulation). 
Treatment/ blinding during the study 
Subjects continued to receive their randomized treatment until their EoS visit. At the EoS visit, randomized 
treatment assignment was unblinded and subjects were treated at the discretion of the investigator. In some 
instances investigators may have been unblinded after a subject’s FAV and before their EoS visit to enable 
investigators to make decisions regarding future treatment and necessary preparations regarding those 
treatments (eg, reimbursement). An additional prespecified analysis for all events through EoS was 
performed to support the primary analyses. A follow-up telephone call to check safety was performed 30 
days after the subject’s last dose of IP, after which the data were cleaned, and a second database freeze and 
final database lock were performed.

The primary comparison of interest was between the hazard rates of time to clinical failure in the 
combination therapy arm (ambrisentan and tadalafil) and the pooled monotherapy arm (ambrisentan and

placebo plus tadalafil and placebo) following the final assessment visit for each subject. The mITT population 
was utilized for this comparison. The comparison was made at a 5% significance level (2-sided). 
Secondary comparisons were of the combination therapy with the individual monotherapy arms. These 
comparisons were only performed if the comparison of the combination arm vs. pooled monotherapy arms 
was significant (5% significance level, 2-sided). 
All randomized subjects included in this study were included in the analyses according to the analysis

If the PP population was greater than 85% of the

Subjects in the mITT population who were 
randomized to combination therapy or 
tadalafil monotherapy at Baseline and who 
were included in the peak/trough 
randomization at Week 16 
This population only includes subjects who had not 
had any medical intervention or a down-titration of 
ambrisentan or tadalafil by Week 16. 
This population was only used in the Peak / 
Trough assessment of the 6MWD. 
a  Because only 17 (3%) subjects in the mITT population had inclusion/exclusion criteria deviations leading to exclusion 
from the per protocol population, the per protocol analyses were not performed. 
For time-to-event endpoints, all lost to follow-up subjects were censored at their last known date in the 
study. For other endpoints, multiple statistical methods of imputation were applied as sensitivity analyses. 
Among them were Mixed Models Repeated Measures (MMRM) as well as imputations methods for missing 
data. Among the imputation methods applied were Worst Rank Score Analysis, Worst Case and Last 
Observation Carried Forward (LOCF). 
Primary Analysis: Time to clinical failure was displayed as Kaplan-Meier event-free curves from 
randomization to individual subject’s FAV. Events that occurred after individual subject’s FAV were not used 
in the primary analysis but were included in the EoS analyses. 
Supportive Analysis of the Primary Endpoint:  
Supportive analyses of time to first clinical worsening (TtCW) event (death, hospitalization for PAH, and 
disease progression) and time to each of the components of the primary endpoint (death, hospitalisation, 
disease progression, and unsatisfactory long-term clinical response) up to FAV (first database freeze) were 
also performed.

Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity: A step-down procedure was adopted among the outcomes. If the 
primary outcome for the combination versus pooled monotherapy comparison was statistically significant, 
inferences on the first secondary outcome were evaluated. If the first secondary outcome for the 
combination versus pooled monotherapy comparison was found to be significant, inferences on the second 
secondary outcome were evaluated. 
The gate keeping approach was implemented for the primary analysis of all secondary outcomes in the 
predefined order below: 
1.  Change from Baseline at Week 24 in NT-pro-BNP was summarized and analyzed as the geometric 
mean and the geometric mean ratio and tested using analysis of covariance with terms for PAH 
etiology and WHO functional class. 
2.  The percentage of subjects with satisfactory clinical response at Week 24 was summarized and 
response (yes, no) analyzed as a binary endpoint using logistic regression, with PAH etiology and 
WHO functional class as covariates. 
3.  Change from Baseline in 6MWD test at Week 24 was analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test 
stratified by PAH etiology and WHO functional class.  
4.  Change from Baseline in WHO functional class at Week 24 was analyzed between treatments using 
a Wilcoxon rank sum test, stratified by PAH etiology and WHO functional class at Baseline. 
5.  Change from Baseline in BDI immediately following exercise at Week 24 was analyzed using the 
Wilcoxon rank sum test stratified by PAH etiology and WHO functional class. 
Additionally, for each outcome where the combination treatment arm was demonstrated as significantly 
improved compared with pooled monotherapy, comparisons of combination treatment versus each 
individual monotherapy treatment were performed. The significance level for all comparisons was 5% 
(two-sided). The gate-keeping approach was used for the primary statistical method for the primary and 
each secondary endpoint. The gate-keeping approach was not used for sensitivity analyses as assessed by 
alternative statistical methods. 
Results 
This study was conducted at 120 centers in 14 countries. A total of 764 subjects were screened and 610 
subjects were subsequently randomized to IP. There were 605 randomized subjects across all treatment 
groups who received at least one dose of IP. Figure 3 displays the subject disposition information.

Participant flow (figure 3) 
mITT population to FAV 
From Baseline to Study Day 28, 8% of subjects in the combination therapy group discontinued IP compared 
with 3% of subjects in the ambrisentan monotherapy group, and 2% of subjects in the tadalafil monotherapy 
group. The difference in early discontinuation of IP appears to be driven by a higher number of subjects 
discontinuing IP due to AEs in the combination therapy group (n=19), compared with pooled monotherapy 
group (n=5). The events types leading to IP discontinuation in the combination therapy group were diverse; 
however the most common AE leading to IP discontinuation was edema/fluid retention, which led to 7 
subjects discontinuing IP in the combination therapy group, compared with 1 subject in the pooled 
monotherapy group. 
The percentage of subjects in the mITT population who withdrew from the study up to FAV was 17% in the 
combination therapy group, 24% in the ambrisentan monotherapy group, and 23% in the tadalafil 
monotherapy group.  (table7). 
The most frequently reported reason for study withdrawal up to FAV in all 3 treatment groups was AE, which 
was reported in 9% of subjects in the combination therapy group and in 12% of subjects in each of the 
monotherapy groups. The percentage of subjects who discontinued IP prematurely up to FAV was 22% in 
the combination therapy group, 34% in the ambrisentan monotherapy group, and 24% in the tadalafil 
monotherapy group. Adverse event was the most frequently reported reason for premature treatment 
discontinuation up to FAV in all 3 treatment groups. The percentage of subjects who discontinued IP up to 
FAV due to an AE was 14% in the combination therapy group, 19% in the ambrisentan monotherapy group, 
and 15% in the tadalafil monotherapy group.

Recruitment 
Following a blinded review of the overall event rate after approximately 2 years of recruitment, the number 
of estimated adjudicated events was approximately 77% of the predicted overall event rate. Consequently, 
the overall event rate was re-estimated to be 12% per year. The sample size was re-estimated assuming an 
8% combination arm event rate and a 16% monotherapy arm event rate per year. The revised event rate 
estimates maintained the original estimate of a 53% reduction in the hazard ratio of combination therapy 
over monotherapy. Based on the recruitment rate at the time of re-estimation, a 148-week recruitment 
period (based on a recruitment rate of 4.9 subjects per week prior to implementation of Protocol Amendment 
No.2 and 3.4 subjects per week thereafter), and 175-week total study duration, it was estimated that to 
obtain 105 mITT subjects with a first event, 614 subjects would need to be enrolled to obtain 520 mITT 
subjects (260 subjects in the combination therapy arm and 260 in the monotherapy arm [130 subjects 
receiving ambrisentan and 130 subjects receiving tadalafil]).  
Conduct of the study 
Methods used for blinding/masking are acceptable. 
Given the possibility of unblinding due to the different safety profiles of ambrisentan and tadalafil, the 
applicant was requested to provide main efficacy outcome separately for patients with and without adverse 
events related to study medication by the investigator including separate analysis for patients who tolerated 
the full investigational doses versus those who did not tolerate uptitration to the full investigational doses. 
Post-hoc analyses restricted to the patients who experienced one or more drug-related adverse events were 
generally consistent with the primary analyses. In summary, bias due to potential unblinding due to the 
different safety profiles of ambrisentan and tadalafil can reasonably ruled out with the ancillary analyses 
provided by the applicant.  
The most relevant amendment occurred upon scientific advice and consultation. The original inclusion and 
exclusion criteria inadvertently permitted enrolment of subjects with potential left heart failure into the 
study. Amendment 2 revised the inclusion exclusion to exclude such subjects. This group is referred to as the 
non-mITT population. The results in this subpopulation were similar to those in the mITT population (see 
efficacy discussion).

Statistical methods used were generally appropriate. However, some issues are further discussed  later in 
the efficacy discussion  part in relation to "data censoring" and lack of a "per protocol analysis" . 
Baseline data 
Demographic characteristics 
mITT population (n=500): demographic and baseline characteristics were generally similar across the 
randomized treatment groups (Table 8). The mean age in each of the 3 treatment groups was approximately 
54 years, 32% of the population was >65 yrs old and only 2% was ≥75 yrs. Most subjects in the mITT 
population were female (78%). Approximately 90% of all subjects were white. Most subjects had a diagnosis 
of IPAH/HPAH with a WHO FC score of III. Subjects were generally equally divided between North America 
and the rest of the world (94% of subjects (257) in rest of the world were from Europe). Most subjects 
(65%-71% across treatment groups) were not on concomitant calcium channel blockers. Three subjects, 2 
in the combination therapy group and 1 in the ambrisentan monotherapy group, had severe renal 
impairment. The median baseline 6MWD (range: 357.00 to 368.50 meters), BDI score (range: 3.5 to 4.0) 
and pro-BNP (range: 869.0 to 1171.0 ng/L) were similar across treatment groups.

a. 
Baseline values for Subject Numbers 079329-706, 08132-751, 083132-802, 083132-803 were not included as they were not made available until the second 
database freeze. 
Subjects from Europe represented just over 50% of the total mITT population (257 subjects out of 500). The 
demographic and baseline characteristics of European subjects were similar to the characteristics of the total 
population. 
The mean age of European subjects was approximately 56 years. Most subjects in each treatment group 
were female (range of 68 – 79% across groups) and white (90%). Most subjects had a diagnosis of IPAH 
(58%) with a WHO FC score of III (74%). Most subjects (70%) were not on concomitant calcium channel 
blockers. The median baseline 6MWD (range: 368 to 381 meters), BDI score (4 in all groups) and pro-BNP 
(range: 747 to 1055 ng/L) were similar across treatment groups. 
Non-mITT population (n= 105): 
subjects in the non-mITT population were slightly older (mean 62 yrs), somewhat more likely to be male 
(30%), and had worse exercise capacity (based on the mean baseline 6-minute walk distance: median 331 
m), and had substantially more comorbidities than subjects in the mITT population. 
The mean age was 54 yrs (range: 18-75) with predominance of female gender (78%), as expected. Most 
subjects had a diagnosis of IPAH/HPAH (95%) and only 3% (14 patients) had heritable PAH.  
There was a high proportion of patients initially diagnosed as the WHO functional class III (compared to WHO 
functional II) enrolled into the AMBITION study. Most patients had a WHO FC score of III (69%). Therefore, 
PAH was advanced in many patients at the time of initial diagnosis. In Europe (257 subjects out of 500 in the 
mITT population), this proportion was even higher, with 74% of European patients being on WHO FC III at 
enrolment in AMBITION. This is entirely consistent with the 75% of patients that are in WHO FC III at 
enrollment in European registries (Hoeper et al. The COMPERA registry. Int J Cardiol. 2013;168: 871-80).

Numbers analysed 
ITT population (population for the safety analysis): Subjects who received at least one dose of IP 
comprise the ITT population; 5 subjects did not receive at least one dose of IP (Table 9).  
mITT population (population for the main efficacy analysis): Over 80% of the ITT population met the 
PAH diagnosis and classification eligibility criteria defined in Protocol Amendment No. 2. These subjects 
comprise the mITT population which is the population of primary interest for all safety and efficacy analyses 
in this report. The difference between the ITT and mITT populations (subjects who received at least one dose 
of IP but did not meet the PAH diagnosis and classification eligibility criteria defined in Protocol Amendment 
No. 2) comprise the non-mITT population.

*Because only 17 (3%) subjects in the mITT population had inclusion/exclusion criteria deviations leading to exclusion 
from the per protocol population, the per protocol analyses were not performed. 
Important protocol deviations during the study are summarized in Table 10. 
Table 10. Important Protocol Deviations; mITT (Randomized Treatment) 
Population
The CHMP considered that the populations definitions are not entirely endorsed. The defined ITT population 
should correspond with the randomised population, but really corresponds to the safety population 
(randomised patients who received at least one dose of study drug). Anyway the difference between the 
randomised and ITT population is only 5 patients who did not receive at least one dose of study drug and 
therefore the definition has no impact on the analyses. 
The mITT population comprises 83% of the ITT population, and excludes patients who did not meet the 
eligibility criteria. This is endorsed. 
The applicant states that a per-protocol analysis was not performed because only 17 (3%) subjects in the 
mITT population had inclusion/exclusion criteria deviations leading to exclusion from the PP population. This

is not endorsed as "eligibility criteria not met" is only one of the types of "important protocol deviations" 
defined in the AMBITION study report. Important protocol deviations were detected in 16% of the AMBITION 
study population. Although it is recognized that ITT analysis is the main analysis for the demonstration of 
superiority, the applicant was requested to provide with a PP analysis excluding the 81 patients with 
important protocol deviations. 
Time to First Adjudicated Clinical Failure Event (Baseline to Final Assessment Visit) (by 
Randomized Treatment [mITT Population]) patients without important protocol deviations 
The CHMP considered that the TTCF for combination vs pooled monotherapy analysis for the mITT 
population excluding the 81 patients with important deviations was consistent with the overall mITT 
population analyses, with statistically significant reductions with the CT in comparison with pooled 
monotherapies and each of the monotherapies separately.  
Outcomes and estimation 
The combination demonstrated a statistically significantly reduction in TTCF in comparison to pooled 
monotherapy (HR 0.55, 95% CI (0.36, 0.85) p=0.0055).  
The comparison to ambrisentan monotherapy was also statistically significant (HR 0.49, 95% CI (0.30, 0.79) 
p=0.0029) but the comparison to tadalafil monotherapy was not statistically significant (HR 0.65, 95% CI 
((0.37, 1.14) p=0.1296). Similarly, an analysis of TTCF for patients without an adverse event assessed as 
related to IP by the investigator was performed. The combination demonstrated a statistically significantly 
reduction in TTCF in comparison to pooled monotherapy (HR 0.40, 95% CI (0.18, 0.85) p=0.0147)). The 
comparison to ambrisentan monotherapy (HR 0.42, 95% CI (0.17, 1.02) p=0.0485) and the comparison to 
tadalafil monotherapy (HR 0.36, 95% CI(0.16, 0.85) p=0.0152) were statistically significant. 
An analysis of patients who experienced an adverse event of fluid retention (irrespective of relationship to 
IP) was also performed. The combination demonstrated a statistically significantly reduction in TTCF in 
comparison to pooled monotherapy [HR 0.34, 95% CI (0.21, 0.54) p<0.0001]. The comparisons to 
ambrisentan monotherapy (HR 0.37, 95% CI (0.22, 0.62) p<0.0001) and to tadalafil monotherapy were 
statistically significant (HR 0.29, 95% CI (0.17, 0.52) p<0.0001). An analysis of the patients who did not 
experience and adverse event of fluid retention did not provide sufficient power to detect a statistically

significant treatment effect due to low event rate. However, the direction of benefit favoured combination 
therapy. 
Primary endpoint 
Time to First Clinical Failure Event (Adjudicated) mITT Population 
The primary endpoint for the study was time to first adjudicated clinical failure event from Baseline to FAV. 
This was a composite endpoint consisting of: death, hospitalization for worsening PAH, disease progression 
and unsatisfactory long term clinical response. In the mITT population, the difference between the first-line 
combination therapy group (ambrisentan plus tadalafil) and the pooled monotherapy group (ambrisentan or 
tadalafil) was statistically significant (log-rank p-value = 0.0002) (Table 11). The reduction in risk of a first 
adjudicated clinical failure event was 50% for subjects in the combination therapy group (hazard ratio [HR] 
from Cox proportional hazards model = 0.502 [95% CI: 0.348, 0.724]). The differences between the 
combination therapy group and each of the individual monotherapy were also statistically significant 
(log-rank p-value = 0.0004; HR = 0.477 [95% CI: 0.314, 0.723] for the ambrisentan monotherapy group 
and log-rank p-value = 0.0045; HR = 0.528 [95% CI: 0.338, 0.827] for the tadalafil monotherapy group). 
The 1-, 2-, and 3-year KM probabilities of having a first adjudicated clinical failure event were lower with 
combination therapy compared with pooled monotherapy and with each monotherapy.

Table is based on a subject’s first event.  Hazard ratio from the Cox Proportional Hazards model and stratified log-rank 
p-value adjusted for Etiology of PAH (IPAH/HPAH vs Non-IPAH) and WHO Functional Class (II vs III).  For censored 
subjects, time (days) is calculated as the number of days from randomization to final assessment visit. Comparisons are 
for combination therapy relative to monotherapy pooled, ambrisentan monotherapy or tadalafil monotherapy.  The values 
in the Total column are calculated across all subjects from the combination therapy, ambrisentan monotherapy, and 
tadalafil monotherapy columns. 
For all treatment group comparisons, Kaplan-Meier curves are shown in Figure 6. The probability of not 
having a first adjudicated clinical failure event from Baseline to FAV was statistically significantly greater for 
subjects in the combination therapy group compared with the pooled or individual monotherapy groups. 
Evidence of sustained efficacy was reflected in maintained divergence of the KM curves through FAV.

Primary endpoint in the ITT population:  
The results in the ITT population were similar to those in the mITT population. The HR from the Cox model 
indicated that subjects in the ITT population treated with combination therapy had a lower risk of having a 
first adjudicated clinical failure event at any time from Baseline to FAV compared with those in the pooled 
monotherapy group. This risk reduction was 47% and was statistically significant (HR = 0.532, 95% CI: 
0.385, 0.733, log-rank p-value < 0.0001). The comparisons of the combination therapy group with the

ambrisentan monotherapy group (HR = 0.507, 95% CI: 0.350, 0.734, log-rank p-value = 0.0002) and the 
tadalafil monotherapy group (HR = 0.551, 95% CI: 0.374, 0.813, log-rank p-value = 0.0023) were 
statistically significant. The risk reductions for the comparisons with the ambrisentan monotherapy group 
(49%) and tadalafil monotherapy group (45%) were similar to the reduction in risk observed for the 
comparison with the pooled monotherapy group. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year KM probabilities of a first 
adjudicated clinical failure event were lower with combination therapy compared with pooled monotherapy 
and with each individual monotherapy.   
Non-mITT Population: In the non-mITT population, the direction of treatment effect was consistent (ie, in 
the same direction) with what was observed in the mITT and ITT populations. Numerically fewer subjects 
(29%) in the combination therapy group had a first adjudicated clinical failure event compared with subjects 
in the pooled monotherapy group (38%) and ambrisentan (38%) and tadalafil (37%) monotherapy groups 
(m5.3.5.1, AMB112565/GS-US-300-0140, Source Table 6.1). 
Components of the primary endpoint: 
Supportive analyses of time to each clinical failure component as well as time to first adjudicated clinical 
worsening event (death, hospitalization for worsening PAH, disease progression and first unsatisfactory 
long-term clinical response) were performed. Supportive analyses were also performed for time to first 
adjudicated clinical worsening event (composite of death, hospitalization for worsening PAH and 
disease progression) with and without censoring at the initiation of blinded combination therapy.  
A Forest plot displaying the hazard ratios for the treatment group comparisons from the analysis of time to 
the first adjudicated clinical failure event from Baseline to FAV shows that the hazard ratio is <1 for all 
treatment group comparisons, and therefore favors combination therapy (Figure 7).The figure also displays 
results for additional adjudicated events. Note that each event included is the first event of that type; 
subjects may have more than one type of event. For the components of clinical failure, the hazard ratio was 
<1 for all treatment group comparisons with the exception of the combination vs. tadalafil monotherapy 
comparison for first adjudicated disease progression (HR=1.116).  
Time to First Clinical Worsening Event (Adjudicated): In the mITT population, the HR from the Cox 
model indicated that subjects treated with combination therapy had a lower risk of having a first adjudicated 
clinical worsening event at any time from Baseline to FAV compared with those in the pooled monotherapy 
group. This risk reduction was 49% and was statistically significant (HR = 0.514, 95% CI: 0.340, 0.778, 
log-rank p-value = 0.0013). The comparison of the combination therapy group versus the ambrisentan 
monotherapy group was statistically significant (HR = 0.443, 95% CI: 0.279, 0.704, log-rank 
p-value = 0.0004). The comparison of the combination therapy group versus the tadalafil monotherapy 
group was not statistically significant (HR = 0.611, 95% CI: 0.364, 1.028, log-rank p-value = 0.0607).

Subgroup analyses 
Subgroup analyses for the primary efficacy endpoint of time to first adjudicated clinical failure event from 
Baseline to FAV were performed for subgroups of interest based on the following: etiology of PAH 
(IPAH/HPAH and non-IPAH), Baseline WHO FC (II, III), region (North America, rest of world (predominantly 
European subjects), Baseline age group (< 65, ≥ 65 years), Baseline age group above or below study 
median age, sex, and Baseline 6MWD above or below study median 6MWD. Note that “study median” refers 
to the median within each population. A Forest Plot displaying the comparisons of the combination therapy 
group versus the pooled monotherapy group for these subgroups of interest is presented in Figure below.

The only subgroups in the mITT population for which a significant treatment by subgroup interaction (p < 
0.10) was observed were the WHO FC subgroups. Overall, the treatment response for combination therapy 
appeared to be greater in the WHO FC II subgroup than in the WHO FC III subgroup; however, for both 
subgroups, a favorable treatment response for combination therapy relative to the pooled monotherapies 
and individual monotherapies was observed (Figure below).

Sensitivity analyses of main efficacy endpoint and their components: 
The key sensitivity analyses are described below. Overall, the results of sensitivity analyses generally 
support the conclusions from the primary efficacy endpoint analysis, but some comparisons for "time to first 
clinical worsening" are non-statistically significant (section c):  
a) Clinical failure events in the ITT Population: The risk reduction in the primary endpoint of the 
combination versus pooled monotherapy was statistically significant in the ITT population (HR: 0.53; 
95%CI: 0.39 to 0.70; log-rank p-value<0.0001). The comparisons with the ambrisentan monotherapy 
group (HR: 0.49, 95%CI: 0.35 to 0.68; log-rank p-value <0.0001) and the tadalafil monotherapy group 
(HR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.39, 0.79; log-rank p-value= 0.0007) were also statistically significant. 
b) Investigator-assessed clinical failure events: The weighted Cohen’s Kappa Statistic for overall 
agreement between adjudicated and investigator-assessed events was 0.874 (95% CI: 0.838, 0.911), 
indicating a strong degree of agreement between adjudicated and investigator-assessed events in the mITT. 
Accordingly, the risk reduction in the investigator-assessed primary endpoint of the combination versus 
pooled monotherapy for first investigator-assessed clinical failure events (baseline to FAV) was statistically 
significant and consistent with the primary analysis (HR: 0.51; 95%CI: 0.36 to 0.70; log-rank 
p-value<0.0001). The comparisons with the ambrisentan monotherapy group (HR: 0.48, 95%CI: 0.33 to 
0.69; log-rank p-value <0.0001) and the tadalafil monotherapy group (HR: 0.547; 95%CI: 0.36 to 0.80; 
log-rank p-value = 0.0020) were statistically significant. 
c) Sensitivity Analyses of Time to First Clinical Failure Event and Time to First Clinical Worsening 
from Baseline to FAV (Adjudicated), Including Events Adjudicated After First Database Freeze: 
Twenty-six events (21 in the mITT population and 5 in the non-mITT population) that occurred before or at 
FAV were positively adjudicated following the first database freeze, including 12 additional first clinical 
failure events in 8 subjects in the mITT population (5 subjects in the combination therapy group and 3 
subjects in the ambrisentan monotherapy group) and 4 subjects in the non-mITT population (3 subjects in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/605025/2015

the combination therapy group and 1 subject in the tadalafil monotherapy group). Sensitivity analyses of the 
time to first clinical failure and time to first clinical worsening (and their components) from Baseline to FAV 
that included these additional adjudicated events were performed for the mITT and ITT populations. The 
results of these sensitivity analyses in both populations are generally consistent with the conclusions from 
the primary analyses, but the comparison between the combination therapy and tadalafil monotherapy 
becomes non-statistically significant (HR: 0.69; 95%CI: 0.42 to 1.14) (Table below).

significant reductions with the CT in comparison with pooled monotherapies and each of the monotherapies 
separately.

between the combination therapy group and the pooled monotherapy in median change from Baseline at Week 24 in 
6MWD (median difference=22.75 meters, 95% CI: 12.00, 33.50, p<0.0001). There was also a statistically 
significant greater median change from Baseline at Week 24 in 6MWD in the combination therapy group compared with 
the ambrisentan monotherapy group (27.00 meters, 95% CI: 12.50, 38.00) (median difference=24.75 meters, 95% CI:

Exploratory endpoints: 
Health Outcomes/Quality of Life Results: Scores for all the CAMPHOR components examined in all 
3 randomized treatment groups showed a decrease (improvement) at Week 24 compared with Baseline. 
However, no statistically significant differences between the combination therapy group and the pooled 
monotherapy group were observed. Scores for all the SF-36 domains and components in all 3 randomized 
treatment groups showed an upward trend (improvement) at Week 24 compared with Baseline. No 
statistically significant differences between the combination therapy group and the pooled monotherapy 
group were observed. 
Treatment Effect on 6MWD at Peak and Trough Plasma Concentrations: In the combination therapy 
group, the ratio of the tadalafil-corrected mean change from Baseline through 6MWD at Week 16 to the 
tadalafil-corrected mean change from Baseline peak 6MWD at Week 16 was greater than 1, with the increase 
in 6MWD greater in the trough group (19.34 meters) than in the peak group (6.22 meters).

Uptitration and treatment compliance: 
More than 90% of subjects had uptitrated both ambrisentan and tadalafil at or before Week 8, indicating that 
the titration scheme used in the AMBITION study was well tolerated. In the mITT population, overall mean 
compliance was high (≥93%) and generally similar across the randomized treatment groups.

This was a Phase III/IV, randomized, double-blind, event-driven study. Enrollment and 
study duration were dependent on the study event rate. All eligible subjects were to 
receive a minimum of 24 weeks of therapy. After screening and randomization 
assessments, subjects were assessed for efficacy and safety at Weeks 4, 8, 16, 24, and 
every 12 weeks thereafter. In between clinic visits, subjects had monthly laboratory 
safety assessments.

Supportive study(ies) 
No complete reports of supportive studies have been submitted. The following additional studies are 
mentioned but information is limited to publications or abstracts to Congresses. The results of these studies 
are consistent with a benefit of dual ambrisentan+PDE5i therapy versus monotherapy with ambrisentan or 
PDF5i: 
1) ATHENA-1 [Oudiz et al. Chest. 2011;140(meeting abstract): 905A]: The efficacy and safety of 
ambrisentan added to background PDE-5i therapy in subjects with WHO FC III PAH who had a suboptimal 
response to the PDE-5i were determined in a Phase 4 open-label study. Eligible subjects were enrolled to 
receive ambrisentan in addition to preexisting background PDE-5i therapy (sildenafil or tadalafil) that must

have been administered for ≥ 12 weeks and have been in a stable regimen for at least 8 weeks before 
enrollment. Subjects received 5-mg ambrisentan once daily for the initial 4 weeks, then 10-mg ambrisentan 
once daily for an additional 44 weeks. The primary endpoint was the change from Baseline in PVR at Week 
24. Additional endpoints included other hemodynamic measures such as mean pulmonary artery pressure 
(mPAP), mean right atrial pressure, and cardiac index; 6-minute walk distance (6MWD); dyspnea index; and 
N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP). Of the 38 subjects enrolled, 31 subjects received 
concomitant sildenafil and 7 subjects received concomitant tadalafil. The addition of ambrisentan to 
suboptimal PDE-5i monotherapy resulted in statistically significant improvements in PVR, cardiac index, and 
other supportive cardiopulmonary hemodynamic parameters. Treatment benefits also were observed in 
several secondary efficacy endpoints, including 6MWD, dyspnea index, WHO FC, and NT-pro-BNP. 
Ambrisentan was generally well tolerated in this population when co-administered with a PDE-5i. 
2) Zhuang et al, (Hypertension Research. 2014;37:507-12): A recently published, prospective, 
double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical study investigated the efficacy and safety of tadalafil in 
subjects who were receiving background ambrisentan therapy [Zhuang, 2014]. A total of 124 adult subjects 
with symptomatic PAH were enrolled and randomized to receive either tadalafil (40 mg once daily) or 
placebo in addition to existing therapy with ambrisentan (10 mg once daily). The study evaluated exercise 
capacity (as measured using 6MWD), symptom improvements, and hemodynamic parameters. A 
statistically significant improvement was observed in the 6MWD at Week 16 in the tadalafil plus ambrisentan 
combination group compared with the ambrisentan alone group. A statistically significant reduction in 
clinical worsening events also was observed in the combination group. Although not statistically significant, 
differences between the treatment groups were observed in cardiopulmonary hemodynamic parameters, 
with improvements in PVR, mean PAP, and cardiac output being greater in the combination group than in the 
ambrisentan alone group. The lack of statistical significance may have been due to the relatively small 
sample size. The safety results suggested that tadalafil was well tolerated when added to background 
ambrisentan therapy. 
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The AMBITION study (n=605 patients) is the single pivotal study that provides clinical data in support of the 
claim for combination therapy for ambrisentan. This study was a Phase 3/4, randomized, double-blind, 
event-driven study designed to compare the safety and efficacy of initiating pharmacotherapy with a 
combination of ambrisentan and tadalafil to initiating pharmacotherapy with ambrisentan or tadalafil 
monotherapy at the same doses. Events were blindly adjudicated by a study specific Clinical Endpoints 
Committee (CEC). In an EMA advice, the CHMP did not endorse the Company’s strategy to base a claim on 
the combination of ambrisentan and tadalafil in comparison to the pooled monotherapy arms. In order to 
show a benefit of both components, two comparisons, one against each monotherapy arm, were considered 
needed. The company then included secondary comparisons of the combination therapy with the individual 
monotherapy arms. These comparisons were only performed if the comparison of the combination arm vs. 
pooled monotherapy arms was significant (5% significance level, 2-sided) (Hierachical procedure). The 
same procedure was applied for secondary outcomes, which is acceptable.  
The AMBITION study was aimed to answer a relevant question: Whether starting treatment with PAH with a 
combination of an ERA and a PDE5 inhibitor would be better than starting on a single specific therapy (ERA 
or PDE5 inhibitor alone) in relationship with clinical outcome. PAH is a progressive disease. The longer you 
have PAH, the more fibrosis and the more negative effects on ventricular function and the earlier the impact 
on PAH deterioration and hospitalisations. "The earlier the better" could theoretically apply for starting PAH 
treatment with a combination therapy of drugs of different pharmacological class and complementary 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/605025/2015 
Page 37/68 
 
  
  
 
mechanisms of action (i.e.: endothelin receptor antagonism and PDE5 inhibition). Therefore, the study 
design allowed to collect information on the ambrisentan/tadalafil combination therapy in PAH that could be 
potentially relevant for standard practice. The global design and objectives are endorsed. 
Inclusion criteria were implemented to recruit patients in whom a diagnosis of Group 1 PAH (IPAH/HPAH or 
PAH associated with connective tissue disease, drugs or toxins, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
infection, or congenital heart defects repaired) > 1 year prior to screening; current diagnosis of WHO FC II 
or III symptoms; and several haemodynamic criteria to reduce the likelihood of enrolling subjects with PH 
due to potential covert left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (WHO Group 2 PH) (non-mITT population). 
Patients recruited into the study were purely naive. Some additional PAH medications, like nitrates, and 
specific PAH medications, like other ERAs, PDE5is and inhaled nitric oxide were not allowed. 
Exclusion criteria were quite more extensive than the contraindications already included in the SmPCs of 
Volibris and Adcirca, as patients with risk factors for developing adverse reactions to ambrisentan were 
excluded (e.g.: anemia, fluid retention, retinal problems and baseline values of ALT and/or AST>2xULN). 
Ambrisentan was uptitrated from 5 mg OD (initial dose) to 10 mg OD (target dose) after 8 weeks, and 
tadalafil was uptitrated from 20 mg OD (initial dose) to 40 mg OD after 4 weeks if the therapy was well 
tolerated. If the subject did not tolerate IP, the following algorithms for changes were to be followed by the 
investigator: 1) Separation of dosing of ambrisentan and tadalafil to occur in the morning and evening, 
respectively; 2) Request blinded down-titration of ambrisentan or tadalafil to the initial dose.  
The applicant based the justification of 10 mg use on incidence of fluid retention (which increase was 
observed in ARIES studies along with higher efficacy of 10 mg dose in patients with class III symptoms) after 
up titration from 5 mg to 10 mg, continued decrease of NT-pro-BNP from week 8 to 16 in ambrisentan 
monotherapy arm and continued improvement in 6MWD from week 8 to 16.  The Company showed that the 
incidence of fluid retention AE did not increase after up titration.  It was also shown that there is positive 
trend in both efficacy variables after up titration to 10 mg for all patients; therefore applicant's approach 
regarding the use of the 10 mg was accepted. 
The main composite endpoint was "clinical failure", defined as time to first event of "all-cause death", 
"hospitalisation", "disease progression" and/or "unsatisfactory long-term clinical response". In an EMA 
advice (, the first three components of the proposed composite (all-cause death, hospitalization for PAH 
worsening, disease progression) were considered adequate and in line with applicable guidance to represent 
clinical worsening. However, the additional fourth component “unsatisfactory long-term clinical response” as 
proposed by the Company was not supported.  
The definition of "clinical failure" was not entirely consistent with the EMA definition of "clinical worsening" 
included in the PAH guideline (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/356954/2008). Although the inclusion of "all-cause death" 
and "PAH hospitalization" are consistent in both definitions, there were differences in the third and fourth 
component ("disease progression" and "unsatisfactory long-term clinical response" used in AMBITION 
versus "time to PAH-related deterioration" included in the PAH guideline). 
Secondary endpoints included the change from baseline to week 24 in N-Terminal pro-B-type natriuretic 
peptide (NT-pro-BNP), satisfactory clinical response (week 24), 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), WHO 
functional class and Borg Dyspnea index (BDI). Exploratory endpoints included Quality of life and 
peak-trough assessment of 6MWD. 
Acceptable methods were used for randomisation, sample size calculation and maintaining of 
blinding/masking. However, given the possibility of unblinding due to the different safety profiles of 
ambrisentan and tadalafil, the applicant was requested to show the main efficacy outcome separately for 
patients with and without adverse events related to study medication by the investigators. The same 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/605025/2015 
Page 38/68 
 
  
  
 
analysis was requested for patients who tolerated the full investigational doses versus those who did not 
tolerate uptitration to the full investigational doses. These ancillary analyses reasonably ruled out a potential 
influence of unblinding in the main study results. 
The primary comparison was between the hazard rates of time to clinical failure in the combination therapy 
arm (ambrisentan and tadalafil) and the pooled monotherapy arm (ambrisentan and placebo plus tadalafil 
and placebo) following the final assessment visit for each subject. The mITT population was utilized for this 
comparison. The comparison was made at a 5% significance level (2-sided). Secondary comparisons were of 
the combination therapy with the individual monotherapy arms. These comparisons were only performed if 
the comparison of the combination arm vs. pooled monotherapy arms was significant (5% significance level, 
2-sided) (Hierarchical procedure). The same procedure was applied for secondary outcomes. Differences 
between the Kaplan-Meier event-free curves of time to clinical failure from randomization to individual 
subject’s FAV were tested for significance by the stratified log-rank statistic test (stratified by the etiology of 
PAH and WHO functional class). The hazard ratio was used to characterize the treatment effect, and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a Cox proportional hazards regression model.  
Time for censoring: a) any subject who was withdrawn or lost to follow-up was censored on the date of their 
last clinical worsening event assessment prior to their being lost from the study; b) at first adjudicated 
event; c) at FAV in those without adjudicated events at FAV or whose first adjudicated event occurred after 
their FAV. 
Several supportive analyses of time to first clinical worsening (TtCW) event (death, hospitalization for PAH, 
and disease progression) and time to each of the components of the primary endpoint up to FAV (first 
database freeze) were also performed. Sensitivity analyses for TtCF, TtCW and the individual components 
were performed up to EoS. Additionally, time to death was analysed up to the final contact. For the analysis 
of time to death, any subject who was withdrawn or lost to follow-up was censored at the date last known 
alive. Additional analyses were performed on investigator assessed events. Sensitivity analyses for time to 
clinical worsening up to FAV and EoS, respectively, were performed that censored subjects (with or without 
a clinical worsening event) at the time of initiation of blinded combination therapy. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
AMBITION included a population (mainly females) with idiopathic PAH and PAH associated to connective 
tissue disease in FC II-III (mainly III) without left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (WHO Group 2 PH). 
Primary endpoint 
The reduction in risk of a first adjudicated clinical failure event (mITT; FAV) was 50% for subjects in the 
combination therapy group (HR = 0.50 [95% CI: 0.39, 0.72]). With respect to the primary endpoint clinical 
failure, the differences between the combination therapy group and each of the individual monotherapy 
were statistically significant for the ambrisentan monotherapy group (HR = 0.48 [95% CI: 0.31, 0.72] and 
for the tadalafil monotherapy group (HR = 0.53; 95%CI: 0.34, 0.83). The 1-, 2-, and 3-year KM probabilities 
of having a first adjudicated clinical failure event were lower with combination therapy compared with pooled 
monotherapy and with each monotherapy.  
Several sensitivity analyses showed consistency in the primary endpoint, including the analysis in the ITT 
population and in the investigator-assessed clinical failure events. The effect on the primary endpoint was 
also consistent in most subgroups, but more pronounced in FCII than in FCIII in relative terms. However, the 
absolute differences between CT and pooled MT in time to first event were 16% in FC II and 12% in FCIII. 
Therefore, clinical relevance of starting PAH specific treatment with ambrisentan+tadalafil combination 
therapy is of similar relevance in both FC II and FCIII naive patients.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/605025/2015 
Page 39/68 
 
  
  
"PAH-related hospitalisation" was the key component driving the difference in the main efficacy endpoint. 
The analysis of first events of PAH hospitalisation showed a 63% decrease in risk with the CT versus MT (HR: 
0.37; 95%CI: 0.22 to 0.64).There was no difference seen in hospitalizations between Europe and rest of 
world (mostly North America) and benefit in reduction of hospitalizations was consistent between 
regions.The numbers of censorings prior to FAV was significant [25 (12%) vs 33 (19%)]. However, the rates 
are similar to those reported in the review of the SERAPHIN study, in which there were 93 (12.5%) subjects 
who did not have any primary events and were censored before the end of the study (double blind period) 
without any further data collection after the end of the study. Theoretically, this issue might have led to an 
even greater observed benefit for combination therapy (i.e. censoring could favor the monotherapy arms), 
but this assumption cannot be demonstrated, as these patients represent "lost to follow-up". Therefore the 
concern was adequately addressed. 
The applicant also analysed the time to first clinical worsening (CW) event (defined as the composite of 
"death", "hospitalization for worsening PAH" and "disease progression"; i.e.: excluding "unsatisfactory 
long-term clinical response" from the main endpoint). This analysis yielded statistically significant results for 
the CT versus pooled MT (HR = 0.51; 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.78) and versus ambrisentan monotherapy 
(HR = 0.44; 95%CI: 0.28 to 0.70) but not versus tadalafil monotherapy (HR = 0.61; 95%CI: 0.36 to 1.03). 
Anyway, the trend in the secondary endpoint of CW was positive in favour of the CT versus tadalafil 
monotherapy and similar to that obtained for the primary endpoint. These results are likely to be attributed 
to insufficient statistical power, but not because the effect on CW could be considered different to that 
obtained in the primary endpoint of "clinical failure ", which is considered clinically relevant. 
A sensitivity analysis including Events Adjudicated After First Database Freeze did show the same 
non-significant trend in time to CW between combined therapy and tadalafil monotherapy (HR: 0.69; 
95%CI: 0.42 to 1.14). Consistently, the effect of the CT versus MT on satisfactory clinical response was more 
pronounced on the comparison with ambrisentan MT than with tadalafil MT, also suggesting a less relevant 
contribution of ambrisentan than that of tadalafil in this parameter.  
Another previous meta-analysis including only 6 RCT and 729 patients [Fox et al. Am J Cardiol. 2011; 
108(8): 1177-82] was unable to show statistical differences between CT and MT in CW (defined as the 
combined endpoint of mortality, admission for worsening PAH, lung transplantation, or escalation of PAH 
therapy) (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.04), probably due to insufficient power. However, the point estimate 
(0.42) was broadly similar to that of the more recent meta-analysis by Manes et al 2014 and to the point 
estimate of the HR (0.51) as defined in AMBITION, for clinical worsening. The meta-analysis by Fox et al 
showed an increase in the 6-minute walk distance at the end of follow-up in favor of CT versus MT (Mean 
difference = +25.2 m; 95%CI: 13.3 to 37.2 m), which is broadly consistent with the +22.75m improvement 
in 6MWD seen in AMBITION with CT versus MT. Incidence of study-drug discontinuation in the meta-analysis 
was similar between the CT and MT groups (RR: 0.89; 95% CI 0.53 to 1.48), which is again consistent with 
the trend towards less study-drug discontinuations observed in AMBITION with the CT versus MT (22% vs. 
29%).  
The reduction in all-cause mortality (CT vs. MT) was not significant in AMBITION (HR: 0.64; 95%CI: 0.31 to 
1.29; mITT; FAV). Mortality ranged from 40 cases (8%) in the mITT-FAV (3% in the combination therapy 
compared to 2% in ambrisentan MT and 7% in tadalafil MT) to 70 cases (12%) in the ITT-End-of-Study 
(10% in the combination therapy compared to 13% in ambrisentan MT and 15% in tadalafil MT), which is 
also consistent with that reported in the more recent meta-analysis of CT versus MT (OR 0.84; 95% CI 
0.52–1.35; p=0.47) [Manes et al. Eur Heart J. 2014; 35 (Suppl.1):11 (abstract 68)]. The incidence of 
mortality in RCTs with PAH medications is relatively low and to achieve statistical significance a sample size 
of several thousands of patients may be required. In contemporary trials, including AMBITION, the main 
component driving the difference are the PAH hospitalisations, while the effect on mortality in relative and 
absolute terms remains modest.

Regarding the quality of the data, vital status was not available for 26 patients (4%) at FAV and for 34 (6%) 
patients at end of study (ITT population). The applicant showed that these figures were similar to those 
observed in contemporary studies. 
Secondary endpoints 
Secondary endpoints included the change from baseline to week 24 in N-Terminal pro-B-type natriuretic 
peptide (NT-pro-BNP), satisfactory clinical response (week 24), 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), WHO 
functional class and Borg Dyspnea index (BDI). Exploratory endpoints included Quality of life and 
peak-trough assessment of 6MWD. The results are described below: 
Change in NT-pro-BNP (mean difference: -33.81 ng/L; 95%CI: -44.78 to -20.66), satisfactory clinical 
response (OR: 1.56; 95%CI: 1.05 to 2.32), change in 6MWH (Median difference: -22.75; 95%CI: -12.00 to 
+33.50), and no significant difference in mortality, change in WHO FC, change in BDI score or QoL scores.  
The effect of the combination therapy versus monotherapy on decrease in NT-pro-BNP was more 
pronounced on the comparison with tadalafil monotherapy than with ambrisentan monotherapy, suggesting 
a more relevant contribution of ambrisentan than that of tadalafil in this parameter. On the contrary, the 
effect of the combination therapy versus monotherapy on satisfactory clinical response was more 
pronounced on the comparison with ambrisentan monotherapy than with tadalafil monotherapy, suggesting 
a more relevant contribution of tadalafil than that of ambrisentan in this parameter. NI-proBNP is more likely 
a disease marker than a PD marker.  
The proBNP marker correlates with prognosis in patients with acute and chronic HF [Savarese et al. JACC 
Heart Fail. 2014;2:148-58] and the result is consistent with the reduced rate of PAH hospitalisations in 
AMBITION, mainly related to heart failure, which is the main component driving the superiority in the main 
endpoint of clinical failure. However, NI-proBNP is more likely a disease marker than a PD marker. The 
applicant was requested to investigate the correlation (at the population and individual level) between the 
effect in NT-proBNP (reduction/no reduction) and several clinical efficacy endpoints (e.g.: no clinical 
failure/clinical failure, no clinical worsening/clinical worsening, and response/no response in 6MWD) before 
accepting the inclusion of this information in section 5.1 of the SmPC as requested by the MAH . 
No statistically significant differences were found in change from Baseline at Week 24 in median WHO FC in 
the combination therapy group compared with the pooled monotherapy group, and change from Baseline at 
Week 24 in BDI was not tested per the hierarchical testing strategy. 
Scores for all the CAMPHOR components and the SF-36 domains and components examined in all 
3 randomized treatment groups showed an improvement (decrease in CAMPHOR and increase in SF-36 
components) at Week 24 compared with Baseline, but no statistically significant differences between the 
combination therapy group and the pooled monotherapy group were observed.  
Wording of the indication / posology 
The wording of the indication proposed as the general statement "...or in combination" was debated during 
all the procedure. 
The company is suggesting deletion of Efficacy has been shown in idiopathic PAH (IPAH) and in PAH 
associated with connective tissue disease". However the patient population studied do not change current 
approved wording. Therefore, this statement should be maintained in the indication. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/605025/2015 
Page 41/68 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
The CHMP considered that the proposed wording reference to "improved outcomes" should be deleted, in 
line with indication approved for other products eg Opsumit.  
Upon request, the applicant provided further data supporting the use in combination with other agents than 
tadalafil. 
Data in combination with sildenafil:  
There are clinical data, although scarce, supporting the use of ambrisentan in combination with sildenafil 
from subgroup analyses of the ATHENA-1 study (n of the subgroup with concomitant sildenafil = 31) 
[Shapiro et al. 2012; 31(4Suppl): S28-S29 (abstract)] and ARIES-3 study (in of the subgroup with 
concomitant sildenafil = 58) [McGoon et al. Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2010; 181:A3351 (abstract)]. 
Although with the limitations of subgroup analyses, the studies showed a beneficial effect of the 
ambrisentan/sildenafil combination in haemodynamic parameters (ATHENA-1) and 6MWD (ARIES-3) that 
were comparable to those reported with ambisentan-tadalafil in the AMBITION study and generally expected 
for a ERA+PDE5i combination, as shown by recent meta-analyses of combination therapy [Fox et al. Am J 
Cardiol. 2011; 108(8): 1177-82] . In addition, there are safety data from a number of subjects (n=383) in 
the VOLT study where ambrisentan was added onto background therapy (predominately sildenafil) or in 
whom additional therapy was added during the study period. The AE profile when ambrisentan was added to 
existing sildenafil treatment was similar to that when ambrisentan was added to existing tadalafil treatment 
and the most common AE was oedema.  
However, there are very limited data regarding the titration process of the combination of ambrisentan with 
other PDE5i, as it has only been studied in AMBITION. In the AMBITION study, patients received 5 mg 
ambrisentan daily for the first 8 weeks before up titrating to 10 mg, dependent on tolerability. When used in 
combination with tadalafil, patients were initiated with 5 mg ambrisentan and 20 mg tadalafil. Dependent on 
tolerability the dose of tadalafil was increased to 40 mg after 4 weeks and the dose of ambrisentan was 
increased to 10 mg after 8 weeks. This information is lacking for the combination of ambrisentan with other 
PDE5i and is therefore not reflected in the SmPC.  
Data in combination with prostanoids:  
There were 97 patients who initiated prostanoid therapy during the AMBITION study: 31 (10%) combination 
therapy patients and 46 (15%) (26 (17%) ambrisentan and 20 (13%) tadalafil) pooled monotherapy. Safety 
data provided do not raise any major concern. However, no efficacy data are available. 
There are safety data from 97 patients who initiated prostanoid therapy during the AMBITION study, but no 
prospective randomised data in combination with prostanoids is currently available. Finally, there are no 
data for the combination of ambrisentan with other targeted PAH therapies such as soluble guanylate 
cyclase stimulators.   
In view of the limited dara in combination with other targeted PAH therapies apart from tadalafil, the 
company proposed a new wording :"including use in initial combination with tadalafil" . However the CHMP 
considered that the new proposal was not appropriate as this wording creates ambiguity about the scope of 
the approved indication, and it may imply that ambrisentan cannot be used with other therapies than 
tadalafil.  
It is recognized that he use of combination treatment is becoming the standard of care in the treatment of 
PAH, in view of a number of studies showing the benefit of combination treatment. This is reflected in the 
recently updated ESC/ERS Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension, which 
recommends the initiation of combination treatment in patients with mild, intermediate and severe PAH 
[Galie 2015a].

SERAPHIN and AMBITION were both long term outcome studies, however, AMBITION had active treatment 
control, and there was a similar extent of combination use in both studies with phosphodiesterase 5 
inhibitors (PDE-5i) or prostacyclines (Table 1).  
Table 1. Combination use with macitentan and ambrisentan in studies with efficacy 
The table below shows the available sources of combination data for ambrisentan. 
Table 2. Sources of combination data with ambrisentan 
For a general recommendation in section 4.1 of use in combination, there is a need to provide compelling 
data with different specific PAH medications (Doc. Ref. EMEA/CHMP/EWP/356954/2008). In this respect, the 
applicant was requested to show data available with ambrisentan in combination with PAH agents other than 
tadalafil (i.e.: sildenafil, vardenafil, or prostanoids).  
Ambrisentan was first approved in 2007 and there are a number of additional studies that contain data on 
combination use with ambrisentan, which means there is a greater totality of use and data in combination 
use with ambrisentan (Table 2). The extent of combination data with ambrisentan includes 560 patients in 
combination with tadalafil, 600 patients in combination with sildenafil and 232 patients in combination with 
prostacyclines from 5 clinical studies.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/605025/2015

It was accepted that these data provide comparable evidence with existing data with macitentan, for which 
a general recommendation of use as monotherapy or in combination was granted.  Additionally, the 
indication statement for Adempas (riociguat) for the treatment of PAH supports combination use with 
endothelin receptor antagonists including ambrisentan ("as monotherapy or in combination with endothelin 
receptor antagonists").  
The company provided a new proposal for the indication as follows:  
“Volibris is indicated for initiation and maintenance in the long-term treatment of pulmonary arterial 
hypertension (PAH) in adult patients of WHO Functional Class (FC) II to III, including use in combination 
treatment (see section 5.1). Efficacy has been shown in idiopathic PAH (IPAH) and in PAH associated with 
connective tissue disease.”  
In view of the above, the general mention to "... including use in combination treatment" was considered 
consistent with the indications granted for Opsumit and Adempas, does not deny patient access to treatment 
options and physician choice of treatment (e.g.: not viewed as limited to combination with tadalafil), and 
was deemed acceptable by the CHMP.  
However the CHMP did not accept to modify the current wording of the indication from "treatment " into 
“initiation and maintenance in the long term", as there is no scientific or regulatory justification supporting 
the modification. 
Overall the CHMP considered that the ambition data together with the additional supportive justification 
provided support the inclusion of the use in combination treatment in the indication.   
Finally, with respect to posology stated in the SmPC, the CHMP considered that the posology should 
accurately reflect the up titration (from 5 mg to 10 mg) and down titration (when needed) process included 
in AMBITION. 
Ambrisentan was up titrated from 5 mg OD (initial dose) to 10 mg OD (target dose) after 8 weeks, and 
tadalafil was up titrated from 20 mg OD (initial dose) to 40 mg OD after 4 weeks if the therapy was well 
tolerated. If the subject did not tolerate the treatment, down titration was initiated. Patients recruited into 
the study were purely naive. Some additional PAH medications, like nitrates, and specific PAH medications, 
like other ERAs, PDE5is and inhaled nitric oxide were not allowed. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The pivotal study supporting current variation is the AMBITION study (n=605 patients), which was a well 
designed and acceptably executed RCT in PAH. The results of this study show superiority of 
ambrisentan+tadalafil versus the pooled monotherapy and versus the two monotherapies with each of the 
compounds separately on the main endpoint of clinical failure, as well as superiority over the pooled 
monotherapy and versus the two monotherapies with each of the compounds separately for the 
supportive/secondary endpoints of Change in NT-pro-BNP and change in 6MWD.  
Additional justifications provided to the CHMP concerns were considered acceptable and the main point 
described below, in relation to the claimed extension of indication related to combination therapy.  
However, the definition of "clinical failure" used as primary endpoint was further explored and clarified  with 
additional analysis.. Several sensitivity analyses showed consistency in the primary endpoint, including the 
analysis in the ITT population and in the investigator-assessed clinical failure events. The effect on the 
primary endpoint was also consistent in most subgroups (FC). 
The applicant analysed the time to first clinical worsening (CW) event (defined as the composite of "death", 
"hospitalization for worsening PAH" and "disease progression"; i.e.: excluding "unsatisfactory long-term 
clinical response" from the main endpoint). This analysis yielded statistically significant results for the CT 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/605025/2015 
Page 44/68 
 
  
  
 
 
 
versus pooled MT (HR = 0.51; 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.78) and versus ambrisentan monotherapy (HR = 0.44; 
95%CI: 0.28 to 0.70) but not versus tadalafil monotherapy (HR = 0.61; 95%CI: 0.36 to 1.03). Anyway, the 
trend in the secondary endpoint of CW was positive in favor of the CT versus tadalafil monotherapy and 
similar to that obtained for the primary endpoint. These results are likely to be attributed to insufficient 
statistical power, but not because the effect on CW could be considered different to that obtained in the 
primary endpoint of "clinical failure ", which is considered clinically relevant. No significant differences 
between treatment were found in mortality, change in WHO FC, BDI score or QoL scores.  
Sequential CT is the most widely utilized strategy both in clinical trials and in clinical practice. From 
monotherapy there is addition of a second and then third drug in cases of inadequate clinical results or in 
cases of deterioration [Galie et al. J Am Coll Cardiol. 2013;62:D60–72]. The AMBITION study has added 
further evidence on CT by showing that, in naive FC II-III patients with PAH, starting with 
ambrisentan-tadalafil combination therapy may be more effective than starting with monotherapy. The 
improvement (less clinical failures) was clinically relevant, particularly in patients with FC II, which is 
reassuring.  
The appropriateness of the claim of combination therapy in the indication was debated during the procedure. 
The efficacy data from the AMBITION study in combination with tadalafil together with the additional 
evidence from other studies provided are acceptable to support an extension of indication. In response to 
the 3rd RSI, the applicant proposal below was consistent with the indications granted for Opsumit and 
Adempas, does not deny patient access to treatment options and physician choice of treatment (e.g.: not 
viewed as limited to combination with tadalafil), thus considered acceptable. 
However the CHMP did not accept to modify the current wording of the indication from "treatment " into 
initiation and maintenance in the long term", as there is no scientific or regulatory justification supporting 
the modification. 
Overall the CHMP considered that the ambition data together with the additional supportive justification 
provided support for the inclusion of the use in combination treatment in the indication as follows : 
Volibris, is indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in adult patients of WHO 
Functional Class (FC) II to III, including use in combination treatment  to improve exercice capacity 
(see section 5.1). Efficacy has been shown in idiopathic PAH (IPAH) and in PAH associated with connective 
tissue disease. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Current application is based on the AMBITION pivotal study, which was conducted at 120 investigational 
centers in 14 countries. A total of 764 subjects were screened, 610 subjects were randomized to IP, and 605 
subjects received IP. All 605 subjects who received IP were included in the ITT population, 500 were 
included in the mITT population, and 105 were included in the non-mITT population. Data for the mITT 
population is primarily presented in this report.  
The AMBITION study is the pivotal trial within this application. A total of 764 subjects were screened, 610 
subjects were randomized to IP, and 605 subjects received IP.  
3 analysis populations were evaluated for safety:  
a) ITT: randomized subjects who received ≥ 1 dose of investigational product);  
b) mITT: Subjects in the ITT population who met the Protocol Amendment No. 2 (without potential diastolic 
dysfunction or thromboembolic PAH.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/605025/2015 
Page 45/68 
 
  
  
c) non-mITT population: population with potential PAH due to covert diastolic dysfunction being enrolled 
(WHO Group 2) or associated thromboembolic PAH. 
Time period for assessing safety depending on medication received: 
a) Through FAV (from baseline to final assessment visit): Patients without clinical failure. The target doses 
for subjects in the AMBITION study were 10 mg of ambrisentan once daily and 40 mg of tadalafil once daily.  
b) From BCT initiation: following the declaration of a clinical failure event by the investigator (the 
investigator did not need to wait for a decision from the Clinical Endpoints Committee), the investigator 
could request that the subject receive post-clinical failure blinded combination therapy (BCT) (to ensure the 
subject received combination therapy regardless of randomized treatment) and/or add non-parenteral 
prostanoids (inhaled) to the current therapy, if deemed appropriate. 
2.5.1.1.  Patient exposure 
Overall subject exposure to IP (on randomized treatment) through FAV in the mITT population was generally 
similar across treatment groups: mean of 550.0 days each for ambrisentan and tadalafil in the combination 
therapy group and 466.5 and 501.2 days in the ambrisentan and tadalafil monotherapy groups, 
respectively. 
In the mITT population, 83 subjects received BCT blinded combination therapy and 6 subjects who had not 
fully uptitrated received BCT monotherapy. Exposure to IP during BCT was longer during BCT blinded 
combination therapy (mean of 356.8 days each for ambrisentan and tadalafil) than during BCT monotherapy 
(55.6 and 14 days in the ambrisentan and tadalafil BCT monotherapy groups, respectively). Exposure data 
during randomized treatment for subjects in the non-mITT population are similar to those in the mITT 
population (Table 17).

2.5.1.2.  Adverse events  
Safety data were collected for the entire study from Baseline to last contact. However, the main period of 
interest for the safety analyses was Baseline to FAV because treatment assignments were blinded during this 
time period and this was the period assessed in the primary efficacy evaluation.  
Most Commonly Reported Adverse Events 
The most commonly reported AEs by system organ class (SOC) from Baseline to FAV are summarized in 
Table 19. Overall, there were no meaningful differences between treatment groups or populations in regard 
to the types of SOCs in which AEs were commonly reported in the study.

Adverse Events by severity 
In the mITT population, most of the AEs reported across all 3 treatment groups from Baseline to FAV were 
mild or moderate in severity (Table 21). The percentage of subjects with severe AEs was generally similar in 
the combination therapy, ambrisentan monotherapy, and tadalafil monotherapy groups (39%, 33%, and 
40%, respectively). 
In the non-mITT population, most of the AEs reported across all 3 treatment groups from Baseline to FAV 
were severe. The percentage of subjects with severe AEs was higher in the combination therapy and 
ambrisentan monotherapy groups (57% and 65%, respectively) than in the tadalafil monotherapy group 
(33%). 
In the ITT population, like the mITT population, most of the AEs reported across all 3 treatment groups from 
Baseline to FAV were mild or moderate in severity. The percentage of subjects with severe AEs was generally 
similar in the combination therapy, ambrisentan monotherapy, and tadalafil monotherapy groups (42%, 
38%, and 38%, respectively). 
Adverse Events related to study medication 
In the mITT population, the percentage of subjects with any AE considered by the investigator to be related 
to IP in the Baseline to FAV time period was higher in the combination therapy group (75%) than in either 
the ambrisentan (60%) or tadalafil (56%) monotherapy groups ). In this population, the most common 
types of IP-related AEs (≥ 5% subject incidence in any randomized treatment group) were generally similar 
across treatment groups (Table 22). The 3 most common IP-related AEs in each treatment group were as 
follows: 
Combination therapy group: headache (38%), peripheral edema (30%), and nasal congestion (16%) 
Ambrisentan monotherapy group: peripheral edema (27%), headache (25%), and flushing (12%) 
Tadalafil monotherapy group: headache (22%), peripheral edema (13%), and myalgia (8%)

In the non-mITT population, the percentages of subjects with IP-related AEs in the Baseline to FAV time 
period were slightly higher in the combination therapy and ambrisentan monotherapy groups (71% and 
69%, respectively) than in the tadalafil monotherapy group (63%). In this population, the most common 
IP-related AEs (≥ 5% subject incidence in any randomized treatment group) were generally similar across 
treatment groups (Table 23). The 3 most common IP-related AEs in each treatment group were as follows:

In the ITT population, like the mITT population, the percentage of subjects with IP-related AEs in the 
Baseline to FAV time period was higher in the combination therapy group (75%) than in either 
the ambrisentan (62%) or tadalafil (58%) monotherapy groups. The 3 most common IP-related AEs in each 
treatment group in the ITT population were similar to those in the mITT population, including peripheral 
edema and headache in each treatment group, plus nasal congestion in the combination therapy and 
ambrisentan monotherapy groups, and myalgia and gastroesophageal reflux disease in the tadalafil 
monotherapy group. The most common events related to IP for the EU subjects did not differ from the group 
as a whole.

Note: Only AEs with an onset between the first dose of IP and the last dose of IP + 30 days through FAV are tabulated. Common AEs are those with

assumed to be related. IVRS unblinding may have occurred before the EoS clinic visit, so there was potential for bias in the assessment of AE severity.

Analysis of Adverse Events by Organ System or Syndrome 
The assessment of AEs by organ system or syndrome was confined to a categorical evaluation of AESIs. 
These categories included AEs related to fluid retention, hypotension, anemia, hypersensitivity, and liver 
events. The AESI categories were identified based on the known side effect profiles of ambrisentan and 
tadalafil as well as any potential for additive or synergistic adverse reactions.  
CHMP comments :  
Compared to monotherapy, patients on CT had: a) more total AEs, severe adverse events, related AEs, AEs  
leading to permanent discontinuation of study medication: b) similar total SAEs and AE leading to 
withdrawal from the study: c) less fatal SAEs (ITT population).  
Similar results were found in the mITT and non-mITT populations. 
By system-organ class, most commonly reported AEs where "general disorders and administration site 
conditions" (66% in the CT versus 52-60% in the MT groups), "infections and infestations" (65% in the CT 
group versus 55-60% in the MT groups) and "nervous system disorders" (62% in the CT group versus 
46-55% in the MT groups) (mITT). Other AEs that were more frequent in the CT group than in the MT groups 
where "eye disorders" (24% vs. 13-18%) and "ear and labyrinth disorders" (12% vs. 7-10%) (mITT). 
The most commonly reported AEs in the CT that in addition were found with >5% difference in subject 
incidence versus MT) (mITT population) were: Fluid retention (55% combination, 40% ambrisentan, 36% 
tadalafil); Peripheral oedema (45% combination, 33% ambrisentan, and 28% tadalafil), Headache (42%

combination, 33% ambrisentan, and 35% tadalafil) and nasal congestion (21% combination, 15% 
ambrisentan, and 12% tadalafil). Other AEs that were more frequent in the CT than in the MT groups were: 
Dizziness (20% combination, 19% ambrisentan, and 12% tadalafil); Anemia (20% combination, 10% 
ambrisentan, and 13% tadalafil); Flushing (15% combination, 14% ambrisentan, and 9% tadalafil); 
Dyspepsia (11% combination, 4% ambrisentan, and 12% tadalafil); Bronchitis (11% combination, 4% 
ambrisentan, and 8% tadalafil) 
The 6 most common drug-related AEs in the CT group (that in addition where more frequent in the CT than 
in the MT groups) were: headache (38% combination, 25% ambrisentan, 22% tadalafil); peripheral 
edema (30% combination; 27% ambrisentan; 13% tadalafil); nasal congestion (16% combination; 10% 
ambrisentan, 6% tadalafil); flushing (15% combination, 12% ambrisentan, 5% tadalafil); nausea (8% 
combination, 7% ambrisentan, 5% tadalafil); and dyspepsia (8% combination, 2% ambrisentan, 5% 
tadalafil).  
Exclusion criteria in AMBITION pivotal study were quite more extensive than the contraindications already 
included in the SmPCs of Volibris (ambrisentan) and Adcirca (tadalafil), thus limiting the external validity of 
the study and probably resulting in underestimation of adverse event and adverse reaction rates. In this 
respect: 
a) It should be added in Section 4.8 that the expected frequencies of adverse reactions with the combination 
therapy is based on a selected patient population, as patients with some risk factor for developing adverse 
reactions to ambrisentan were excluded (e.g.: anemia, fluid retention, retinal problems, baseline values of 
ALT and/or AST>2xULN, when contraindication to Volibris is for >3xULN). 
b) A warning should be included in section 4.4 indicating that, when ambrisentan is given concomitantly with 
tadalafil, the occurrence of peripheral edema and anemia is significantly increased, particularly during the 
first month of treatment. Additionally an increase in frequency for the following ADR is noted; anemia, 
headache, nasal congestion, dizziness, flushing, dyspepsia and bronchitis  
The SmPC wording suggested "slightly increase in anemia" should be amended, as a two-fold increase in 
anemia (from 10% to 20%) cannot be considered as "slight".  
c) The imbalance in adverse events of anemia (CT 20% vs ambrisentan 10%, mITT, FAV) is of concern, as 
anemia is a marker of poor prognosis in the long-term in patients with PAH (Krasuski et al. Int J Cardiol. 
2011;150:291-5; Hampole et al. Am J Cardiol. 2009; 104:868-72) and was further clarified.  
The mean change from baseline in haemoglobin and haematocrit are quite insensitive about significant 
variations in individual patients.The incidence of anemia reported as adverse event on combination 
treatment is 10% higher than ambrisentan treatment and 7% higher than tadalafil treatment.  
Looking at patients with transfusions (CT: 12; ambrisentan MT: 5; tadalafil: 10), it seems that tadalafil is the 
main responsible for anemia in the CT, which is consistent with the higher rate of AEs of anemia in the 
tadalafil MT group than in the ambrisentan MT group (13% vs 10). 
With respect to the analysis of the main endpoint in patients with anemia AEs, there is a discrepancy 
between the mITT (efficacy population) analysis (fewer clinical failure events with the CT: 20% vs 
ambrisentan MT 29% and tadalafil MT 40%), and the ITT (safety population) analysis (patients experiencing 
a clinical failure event following the onset of anemia was approximately the same:  CT 25% vs ambrisentan 
MT 24% vs. tadalafil MT 27%). In both cases, it seems that the worse results in both analyses are for 
patients on tadalafil MT, which is consistent with a more relevant decrease in efficacy with tadalafil MT than 
with the other options in patients who develop anemia. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/605025/2015 
Page 51/68 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Finally, with respect to all-cause mortality, the numerical trend was against the CT in patients with anemia 
in the mITT (CT 2 cases vs ambrisentan MT 0 cases vs tadalafil MT 2 cases) and the ITT (CT 5 cases vs. 
ambrisentan MT 0 cases vs tadalafil MT 2 cases), although events numbers were very low.  
Therefore, data provided suggest that in patients having an AE of anemia, there is a less robust benefit in 
efficacy with the CT versus pooled MT than in patients without anemia, mainly attributable to the tadalafil 
component. However, no definitive conclusions can be reached, due to the limitations of subgroup analyses 
and low event rates.  
d) It was further explored whether the lack of benefit in QoL despite lower rate of hospitalisations with CT 
could be due to the significant increase in some adverse events with the CT compared to monotherapy (e.g.: 
fluid retention, peripheral oedema, headache, anemia). Subgroup analyses of QoL in patients with and 
without these adverse events could be of interest. 
The applicant stated that that there is an improvement in QoL for all study arms and no statistical difference 
between them. This is endorsed, but the requested analyses were not provided by the MAH. The increased 
rate of AEs is probably the cause for not finding benefits in QoL with the CT, despite a significantly better 
efficacy. Anyway, this issue will not change the Benefit risk and no further information was pursued. 
Hypersensitivity reactions were more common in the CT group than in the ambrisentan or tadalafil 
monotherapy groups (13% vs. 10% vs. 7%). The most commonly reported hypersensitivity AE was rash (CT 
group 7%, ambrisentan monotherapy 5%, taladafil monotherapy 2%). Most cases were mild and only 2 of 
them (in the ambrisentan monotherapy group) required discontinuation of IP or withdrawal from study. The 
SmPC already includes that rash is a "very common" adverse reaction observed at a higher frequency 
category when ambrisentan was administered long term (>12 weeks duration) in combination with tadalafil, 
which is acceptable. 
Statistical analysis of safety data: The applicant, upon request, submitted additional statistical analysis 
of the safety data to show whether there is a statistically significant difference in the safety profile of the 
combination group in comparison with the monotherapy groups. Of greatest interest would be the analysis 
of SAEs (fatal included) and AESI (anemia, fluid retention). The Applicant stated that due to the fact the 
study was not powered on adverse events and given the multiple events discussed only descriptive statistics 
were presented. This is acknowledged by the CHMP and not pursued further. 
2.5.1.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
For the safety summaries, treatment-emergent fatal AEs were reported between 1st dose of study drug and 
last dose + 30 days (on randomized treatment and from BCT initiation). For the efficacy analyses, outcomes 
of death were reported to last contact as part of the vital status follow up and thus include subject deaths 
which occurred >30 days after discontinuation of IP. Outcomes of death reported >30 days after 
discontinuation of IP were not reported as fatal AEs for safety purposes. Table 28 summarizes fatal AEs by 
population for the time periods Baseline to FAV and overall (on randomized treatment), as well as subject 
deaths from the efficacy analysis for the time periods Baseline to last contact (and from BCT initiation).

With respect to all-cause death, as commented in the efficacy section:  
 Mortality was relatively low for a severe disease like PAH and for an mean exposure to study drugs about 1,5 
years (mean exposure between 467 to 550 days). All-cause mortality ranged from 18 cases in the mITT-FAV 
(3% in the combination therapy compared to 2% in ambrisentan monotherapy and 7% in tadalafil 
monotherapy) to 70 cases in the ITT-End-of-Study (10% in the combination therapy compared to 13% in 
ambrisentan monotherapy and 15% in tadalafil monotherapy).  
In addition, numbers of deaths shown in the tables correspond to the baseline to FAV (24 deaths in the ITT 
population, FAV), which is an underestimation of total deaths (those occurring after FAV were not included). 
Total deaths in AMBITION were 70 cases (ITT population, baseline to last contact). The applicant is 
requested to provide with a summary table including "all" 70 deaths reported in AMBITION study in the ITT 
population (by intended treatment group) (baseline to FAV; FAV to end of study; and end of study to last 
contact). The 70 deaths should be reported by group and SOC. 
With respect to the causes of death in the ITT population (FAV), the trend towards a lower number of deaths 
in the CT group versus pooled MT was related to deaths due to heart failure or cardiac arrest (1 in the CT 
group vs. 5 deaths in the pooled MT group) and worsening of PAH (2 in CT group vs. 3 deaths in the pooled 
MT group), which is consistent with the results of the primary endpoint favouring CT versus pooled MT.  
Some discrepancies have been identified in the submitted data for SAE (Deaths) and were further clarified by 
the applicant.  
2.5.1.4.  Other SAEs 
In the mITT population (Table 32), generally similar percentages of subjects across treatment groups from 
Baseline to FAV had a serious adverse event (SAE; 36% of subjects each in the combination therapy and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/605025/2015 
Page 53/68 
 
  
  
 
ambrisentan monotherapy groups and 41% of subjects in the tadalafil monotherapy group). The 3 most 
common SAEs in each treatment group were as follows:  
 
 
 
Combination therapy group: pulmonary hypertension (4%), pneumonia (4%), and dyspnea and 
syncope (3% each) 
Ambrisentan monotherapy group: pulmonary hypertension (9%), pneumonia (6%), and cardiac failure 
and syncope (3% each)  
Tadalafil monotherapy group: pulmonary hypertension (7%) and syncope and anemia (4% each)  
No SAEs were reported more commonly (> 5% difference in subject incidence) in the combination therapy 
group than in either monotherapy group in the mITT population from Baseline to FAV. 
In the non-mITT population (Table 33), the percentages of subjects from Baseline to FAV with an SAE in the 
combination therapy group (57%) and ambrisentan monotherapy group (58%) were higher than that in the 
tadalafil monotherapy group (43%). The most common SAEs in each treatment group were as follows:  
 
 
 
Combination therapy group: pneumonia and anemia (8% each), which were the only SAEs reported for 
> 2 subjects in this group  
Ambrisentan monotherapy group: pulmonary hypertension (19%), right ventricular failure (15%), and 
pneumonia (12%), which were the only SAEs reported for > 2 subjects in this group) 
Tadalafil monotherapy group: no SAEs were reported for > 2 subjects in this group 
The only SAE reported more commonly (> 5% difference in subject incidence) in the combination therapy 
group than in either monotherapy group in the non-mITT population from Baseline to FAV was anemia, 
which was reported for 8% of subjects in the combination therapy and ambrisentan monotherapy groups 
and no subjects in the tadalafil monotherapy group. 
SAEs in the ITT Population (Baseline to FAV) 
The percentage of subjects with any SAE was 40% in the combination therapy group, 39% in the 
ambrisentan monotherapy group, and 42% in the tadalafil monotherapy group (Table 34). The 3 most 
frequently reported SAEs in the combination therapy group were pneumonia, pulmonary hypertension, 
dyspnea, anemia, and syncope. In the ambrisentan monotherapy group the 3 most frequently reported 
SAEs were pulmonary hypertension, pneumonia, and right ventricular failure. In the tadalafil monotherapy 
group the 3 most frequently reported SAEs were pulmonary hypertension, pneumonia, and syncope. No 
SAEs were reported more commonly (> 5% difference in subject incidence) in the combination therapy 
group than in either monotherapy group in the ITT population from Baseline to FAV.

2.5.1.5.  Laboratory findings 
Clinical laboratory evaluations included hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis. 
Hematology: In the ITT population, for the period from Baseline to FAV, 18% of subjects in the 
combination therapy group had a hemoglobin value of clinical concern (<10 g/dl) compared with 10% in 
the ambrisentan monotherapy group and 14% in the tadalafil monotherapy group. This is consistent with 
the results of adverse events of "anemia" reported by the investigators. 
Liver function tests: 9 subjects in the ITT population (5 in the combination treatment group, 2 in the 
ambrisentan group and 2 in the tadalafil monotherapy group) had significant liver chemistry results 
(aminotransferase elevations > 3 x ULN) which met the stopping criteria defined in the protocol. These 
results are within expected but should be interpreted with caution, as patients with aminotransferase 
2-3xULN and/or bilirubin >1.5xULN at the Screening Visit were excluded from the study. 
Potential Hy’s Law cases (ALT >3xULN + bilirubin >2xULN):  2 subjects met biochemical criteria 
in Hy’s Law (ITT, FAV). These 2 cases were not designated as Hy’s Law cases because in each case the 
elevated liver enzyme levels could be attributed to other causes (lung carcinoma and cardiogenic shock). 
Other parameters: no other remarkable disturbances were found in biochemistry, vital signs or ECG. 
2.5.1.6.  Safety in special populations 
For the AMBITION study, summaries of AEs and SAEs by subgroups of sex, baseline 6-minute walk distance 
above or below median baseline 6-minute walk distance, baseline age group (< 65, ≥ 65 years), baseline 
age above or below median baseline age, etiology of PAH (idiopathic PAH/heritable PAH and nonidiopathic 
PAH), and baseline WHO FC (II or III) for the mITT and ITT populations showed that the AE profile and 
tolerability in the subgroups were consistent with the known AE profiles of ambrisentan and tadalafil. 
Elderly: 
There is no clinically relevant difference in the overall numbers of AEs by age, as nearly all patients had at 
least one AE during study regarless of age. However, in patients above 65 years, there is a trend towards a 
higher incidence of SAEs with CT (46%) than with monotherapy (41% in both monotherapy arms.  
The data provided from AMBITION suggest no increased incidence of oedema peripheral in older subjects 
randomised to combination therapy as compared with monotherapy. There was no apparent age-related 
effect on serious oedema peripheral, serious fluid retention or serious anemia, but event rates were too low 
to draw any meaningful conclusion.  
Children: The AMBITION study excluded subjects < 18 years of age. Therefore, no clinical data on the use 
of ambrisentan plus tadalafil in pediatric subjects are available.  
Hepatic impairment: Subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C with or without 
cirrhosis), subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min), and subjects with 
serum ALT or AST values > 2 × ULN or serum bilirubin values > 1.5 × ULN were excluded from the 
AMBITION study. Therefore, no clinical data on the use of ambrisentan plus tadalafil in subjects with severe 
renal impairment or subjects with severe hepatic impairment are available. 
Pregnancies: Three subject pregnancies were reported during the course of the study. Two pregnancies (1 
CT group and 1 tadalafil monotherapy group) were terminated without further complications. The third 
patient (CT group) died while hospitalized for elective abortion, 9 days after the last dose of study 
medication.

2.5.1.7.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No clinically relevant PK interactions are expected between ambrisentan and tadalafil. However, both 
compounds are vasodilators. Therefore, a PD interaction resulting in vasodilatory (adverse) effects is likely 
to occur. 
Hypotension was more common in the CT group than in the ambrisentan or tadalafil monotherapy groups 
(32% vs. 27% vs. 27%). The most commonly reported hypotensive adverse event was "dizziness" (CT 
group 20%, ambrisentan monotherapy 19%, taladafil monotherapy 12%). Most cases were mild and only 2 
of them (in the CT group) required discontinuation of IP or withdrawal from study. The SmPC already 
includes that dizziness is a "very common" adverse reaction observed at a higher frequency category when 
ambrisentan was administered long term (>12 weeks duration) in combination with tadalafil, which is 
acceptable. 
2.5.1.8.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
AEs leading to discontinuation of IP (ITT population): similar percentages were found in the 3 groups 
(CT group 16%, ambrisentan group 14%, tadalafil group 13%). The 3 most frequently reported AEs leading 
to discontinuation of IP in the combination therapy group were dyspnea, peripheral edema and headache. 
AEs leading to study withdrawal (ITT population): the percentage of subjects with these events was 
11% in all 3 randomized treatment groups. The 3 most frequently TEAE reported as leading to withdrawal 
from the study in the combination therapy group were dyspnea, peripheral edema, and headache. In the 
ambrisentan monotherapy group the only TEAE leading to withdrawal from the study reported by more than 
2 subjects was pulmonary hypertension. In the tadalafil monotherapy group no TEAE leading to withdrawal 
from the study was reported by more than 2 subjects. 
The analysis of discontinuations due to AEs with CT therapy does not raise any particular concern in 
comparison to monotherapy with either ambrisentan or tadalafil. 
2.5.1.9.  Post marketing experience 
Cumulative worldwide postmarketing exposure to ambrisentan and tadalafil based on sales data are 
estimated to be 56,600 patient-years and 53,400 patient-years, respectively.  
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
A total of 764 subjects were screened, 610 subjects were randomized to IP, and 605 subjects received IP. 
Exposure to IP (on randomized treatment) through FAV in the mITT population was generally similar across 
treatment groups: mean range from 467 to 550 days.  Exposure to IP during BCT was longer during BCT 
blinded combination therapy (mean of 357 daysl) than during BCT monotherapy (56 and 14 days in the 
ambrisentan and tadalafil BCT monotherapy groups, respectively). This was expected as BCT was 
administered in stages and BCT monotherapy was administered only during the first stage for subjects 
randomized to monotherapy who had not uptitrated to the target dose. Exposure data during randomized 
treatment for subjects in the non-mITT population are similar to those in the mITT population. Exclusion 
criteria in AMBITION pivotal study were quite more extensive than the contraindications already included in 
the SmPCs of Volibris (ambrisentan) and Adcirca (tadalafil), thus limiting the external validity of the study 
and probably resulting in underestimation of adverse event and adverse reaction rates. 
Assessment report

The AMBITION study excluded subjects < 18 years of age. Therefore, no clinical data on the use of 
ambrisentan plus tadalafil in pediatric subjects are available.  
Total adverse events: compared to monotherapy, patients on CT had: a) more total AEs, severe adverse 
events and related AEs: b) similar total SAEs and AE leading to discontinuation or withdrawal from the study; 
c) less fatal SAEs (ITT population). Similar results were found in the mITT and non-mITT populations. 
AEs by system-organ class: most commonly reported AEs where "general disorders and administration site 
conditions" (66% in the CT versus 52-60% in the MT groups), "infections and infestations" (65% in the CT 
group versus 55-60% in the MT groups) and "nervous system disorders" (62% in the CT group versus 
46-55% in the MT groups) (mITT). Other AEs that were more frequent in the CT group than in the MT groups 
where "eye disorders" (24% vs. 13-18%) and "ear and labyrinth disorders" (12% vs. 7-10%) (mITT). 
Most commonly reported AEs in the CT group that in addition were found with >5% difference in subject 
incidence versus MT (mITT population) were: Fluid retention (55% combination, 40% ambrisentan, 36% 
tadalafil); Peripheral edema (45% combination, 33% ambrisentan, and 28% tadalafil), Headache (42% 
combination, 33% ambrisentan, and 35% tadalafil) and nasal congestion (21% combination, 15% 
ambrisentan, and 12% tadalafil).  
Other AEs that were more frequent in the CT than in the MT groups were: Hypotension (32% combination vs. 
27% ambrisentan vs. 27% tadalafil), being Dizziness the more frequent manifestation (20% combination, 
19% ambrisentan, and 12% tadalafil); Most cases were mild and only 2 of them (in the CT group) required 
discontinuation of IP or withdrawal from study. The SmPC already includes that dizziness is a "very common" 
adverse reaction observed at a higher frequency category when ambrisentan was administered long term 
(>12 weeks duration) in combination with tadalafil, which is acceptable. Anemia (20% combination, 10% 
ambrisentan, and 13% tadalafil); Flushing (15% combination, 14% ambrisentan, and 9% tadalafil); 
Dyspepsia (11% combination, 4% ambrisentan, and 12% tadalafil); Bronchitis (11% combination, 4% 
ambrisentan, and 8% tadalafil) 
Most common drug-related AEs in the CT group, that in addition where more frequent in the CT than in the 
MT groups, were: headache (38% combination, 25% ambrisentan, 22% tadalafil); peripheral oedema (30% 
combination; 27% ambrisentan; 13% tadalafil); nasal congestion (16% combination; 10% ambrisentan, 
6% tadalafil); flushing (15% combination, 12% ambrisentan, 5% tadalafil); nausea (8% combination, 7% 
ambrisentan, 5% tadalafil); and dyspepsia (8% combination, 2% ambrisentan, 5% tadalafil).  
In conclusion, although total AEs are increased with the combination therapy as compared to monotherapy, 
the increase is mainly at expenses of non-serious AEs, while SAEs were similar across treatment groups and 
fatal SAEs were numerically lower in the CT group than in the MT groups. Therefore, there are no major 
safety concerns. However, some increases in labelled adverse events (anemia, fluid retention, peripheral 
oedema), and unlabelled events (osteonecrosis, non-cardiac chest pain and sudden hearing loss) and the 
potential underestimation of risk due to exclusion criteria in AMBITION study were further addressed by the 
applicant. Overall findings on the entire Volibris safety database (clinical trials, registries, spontaneous 
reports) indicate that osteonecrosis and non-cardiac chest pain do not warrant inclusion in section 4.8. 
However, there were 5 cases of hearing loss/deafness (0.20%) with the CT reported by the investigators as 
related (all of them) and serious (3 of them). The applicant proposes to include sudden or other hearing loss 
for CT in the combination table of the SmPC section 4.8 which was endorsed. 
Based on the above data, a warning was included in section 4.4 indicating that, when ambrisentan is given 
concomitantly with tadalafil, peripheral oedema and anemia was significantly increased.  
Assessment report

The percentage of subjects with any SAE was similar in the 3 groups (CT 40%, ambrisentan 39%, tadalafil 
42%) (ITT, baseline to FAV). The most frequently reported SAEs in the combination therapy group were 
pneumonia (15), pulmonary hypertension (11), dyspnea (9), anemia (9), and syncope (9).). 
Hypersensitivity reactions were more common in the CT group than in the ambrisentan or tadalafil 
monotherapy groups (13% vs. 10% vs. 7%). The most commonly reported hypersensitivity AE was rash (CT 
group 7%, ambrisentan monotherapy 5%, taladafil monotherapy 2%). Most cases were mild and only 2 of 
them (in the ambrisentan monotherapy group) required discontinuation of IP or withdrawal from study. The 
SmPC already includes that rash is a "very common" adverse reaction observed at a higher frequency 
category when ambrisentan was administered long term (>12 weeks duration) in combination with tadalafil, 
which was acceptable. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The AMBITION study provides clinical safety data from 605 patients treated for 467 to 550 days (mean 
range) with ambrisentan in combination with tadalafil versus monotherapy with either of these compounds.  
Exclusion criteria in AMBITION pivotal study were quite more extensive than the contraindications already 
included in the SmPCs of Volibris (ambrisentan) and Adcirca (tadalafil), as some patients without 
contraindications to ambrisentan therapy, but at risk of developing adverse reactions with ambrisentan, 
were excluded (e.g.: pre-existing anemia, fluid retention, retinal problems, baseline values of ALT and/or 
AST>2xULN,.  
Compared to monotherapy, patients on CT had: a) more total AEs, severe adverse events, related AEs, AEs  
leading to permanent discontinuation of study medication: b) similar total SAEs and AE leading to 
withdrawal from the study: c) less fatal SAEs (ITT population). Similar results were found in the mITT and 
non-mITT populations. Particularly, adverse events of anemia  were increased with the CT (20% 
combination, 10% ambrisentan, and 13% tadalafil). However, ancillary analyses did not show a poorer 
prognosis in patients who experienced anemia with the CT. Other most commonly reported AEs in the CT 
group that in addition were found with >5% difference in subject incidence versus MT (mITT population) 
were: Fluid retention, Peripheral edema, Headache and nasal congestion). Other AEs that were more 
frequent in the CT than in the MT groups were: Hypotension, dizziness, flushing, dyspepsia and bronchitis. 
A warning was included in section 4.4 indicating the increase in anemia and peripheral oedema when 
ambrisentan is given concomitantly with tadalafil. Additionally the new ADR observed with the combination 
therapy is included  (sudden or other hearing loss) in section 4.8. 
Mortality was relatively low for a severe disease like PAH and for an mean exposure to study drugs about 1,5 
years (mean exposure between 467 to 550 days). Regarding the quality of the data, vital status was not 
available for 26 patients (4%) at FAV and for 34 (6%) patients at end of study (ITT population), which is a 
poor figure for a population that is usually followed-up in specialised centers. 
The percentage of subjects with any SAE was similar in the 3 groups (CT 40%, ambrisentan 39%, tadalafil 
42%) (ITT, baseline to FAV).  
Hypersensitivity reactions were more common in the CT group than in the ambrisentan or tadalafil 
monotherapy groups (13% vs. 10% vs. 7%), being "rash" the more commonly reported term. No major 
findings were evident regarding liver function tests, testicular function tests or special populations. 
Additional data provided by the applicant showed a higher rate of adverse reactions in patients above 65 
years old compared with those below 65 years old, but with similar relative risks of adverse reactions of the 
CT vs. MT groups regardless of age. 
In conclusion, although total AEs are increased with the combination therapy as compared to monotherapy, 
the increase was mainly at expenses of non-serious AEs, while SAEs were similar across treatment groups

and fatal SAEs were numerically lower in the CT group than in the MT groups. Therefore, there are no major 
safety concerns. SmPC amendments were made in relationship with anemia, fluid retention and hearing 
loss.

2.7.  Update of the product information   
The MAH proposed to update sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC and corresponding Package 
leaflet in order to include an expanded therapeutic indication for the treatment of pulmonary arterial 
hypertension (PAH) (World Health Organization [WHO] Group 1). In addition, the MAH took the opportunity 
to update Annex II to reflect a change in the PSUR cycle. 
The main aspects related to amendments introduced in the SmPC sections, 4.1, 4.2 , 4.4 and 4.8 have been 
discussed earlier in the report. The key results of the ambition study are introduced in section 5.1.  
2.7.1.  User consultation 
The submitted variation type II for expanded therapeutic indication for the treatment of pulmonary arterial 
hypertension, does not involve significant changes in the PIL. Therefore, the company´s justification to not 
undertake further consultation with target patient groups is considered acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
3.1.  Benefits 
The AMBITION study (n=605 patients) is the single pivotal study that provides clinical data in support of the 
claim  of  combination  therapy  for  ambrisentan.  This  study  was  a  Phase  3/4,  randomized,  double-blind, 
event-driven  study  designed  to  compare  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  initiating  pharmacotherapy  with  a 
combination  of  ambrisentan  and  tadalafil  to  initiating  pharmacotherapy  with  ambrisentan  or  tadalafil 
monotherapy  at  the  same  doses.  Events  were  blindly  adjudicated  by  a  study  specific  Clinical  Endpoints 
Committee (CEC).  
AMBITION  included  a  population  (mainly  females)  with  idiopatic  PAH  and  PAH  associated  to  connective 
tissue disease in functional class II-III (mainly III) without left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (WHO Group 
2). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/605025/2015 
Page 62/68 
 
  
  
 
Patients recruited into the study were purely naive.  Some additional PAH medications, like nitrates, and 
specific PAH medications, like other ERAs, PDE5is and inhaled nitric oxide were not allowed. Ambrisentan 
was uptitrated from 5 mg OD  (initial dose) to 10 mg  OD  (target dose)  after 8 weeks, and tadalafil was 
uptitrated from 20 mg OD (initial dose) to 40 mg OD after 4 weeks if the therapy was well tolerated. If the 
subject did not tolerate, down-titration was initiated.  
The results of the AMBITION showed superiority of ambrisentan+tadalafil combination therapy versus the 
pooled monotherapy  with each of the compounds on the main endpoint of clinical failure [46 first events 
(18%) vs. 77 first events (31%); HR: 0.50; 95%CI: 0.39 to 0.72], Change in NT-pro-BNP (mean difference: 
-33.81 ng/L; 95%CI: -44.78 to -20.66), satisfactory clinical response (OR: 1.56; 95%CI: 1.05 to 2.32), 
change in 6MWH (Median difference: -22.75; 95%CI: -12.00 to +33.50), and no significant difference in 
mortality, change in WHO functional class, change in BDI score or Quality of Life scores.  
With respect to the primary endpoint “clinical failure”, the differences between the combination therapy and 
each  of  the  individual  monotherapy  were  also  statistically  significant  for  the  ambrisentan  monotherapy 
group (HR = 0.48 [95% CI: 0.31, 0.72] and for the tadalafil MT group (HR = 0.53; 95%CI: 0.34, 0.83). The 
1-,  2-,  and  3-year  KM  probabilities  of  having  a  first  adjudicated  clinical  failure  event  were  lower  with 
combination therapy compared with pooled monotherapy and with each monotherapy. Several sensitivity 
analyses showed consistency in the primary endpoint, including the analysis in the ITT population and in the 
investigator-assessed clinical failure events. The effect on the primary endpoint was also consistent in most 
subgroups, but more pronounced in functional class II than in functional class III in relative terms. However, 
in absolute terms, the benefit was similar in both functional class I as absolute event rate of primary events 
has to be higher in functional class III than in less sick functional class II and III.PAH-related hospitalisation" 
was the key component driving the difference in the main efficacy endpoint. The analysis of first events of 
PAH hospitalisation showed a 63% decrease in risk with the combination therapy versus monotherapy (HR: 
0.37; 95%CI: 0.22 to 0.64).  
The applicant also analysed the time to first clinical worsening event (defined as the composite of "death", 
"hospitalization for worsening PAH" and "disease progression"; i.e.: excluding "unsatisfactory long-term 
clinical response" from the main endpoint). This analysis yielded statistically significant results for the 
combination therapy versus pooled monotherapy (HR = 0.51; 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.78).  
3.2.  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The Company’s strategy to base a claim on the combination of ambrisentan and tadalafil in comparison to 
the pooled monotherapy arms was not endorsed in a previous EMA scientific advice. In order to show a 
benefit of both components, two comparisons, one against each monotherapy arm, were requested. The 
company then included secondary comparisons of the combination therapy with the individual monotherapy 
arms. These comparisons were only performed if the comparison of the combination arm vs. pooled 
monotherapy arms was significant (5% significance level, 2-sided) (Hierachical procedure). The same 
procedure was applied for secondary outcomes.  
The main composite endpoint in AMBITION study was "clinical failure", defined as time to first event of 
"all-cause death", "hospitalisation", "disease progression" and/or "unsatisfactory long-term clinical 
response". Although the inclusion of "all-cause death" and "PAH hospitalization" are consistent in both 
definitions, there are  differences in the third and fourth component ("disease progression" and 
"unsatisfactory long-term clinical response" used in AMBITION versus "time to PAH-related deterioration" 
included in the PAH guideline) (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/356954/2008).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/605025/2015 
Page 63/68 
 
  
  
 
 
 
CT reduced the risk of "Clinical Worsening" (applicant's definition) versus ambrisentan monotherapy 
(HR = 0.44; 95%CI: 0.28 to 0.70) but not versus tadalafil monotherapy (HR = 0.61; 95%CI: 0.36 to 1.03), 
thus suggesting that the contribution of ambrisentan to the combination in terms of clinical worsening could 
be less relevant than that of tadalafil. A sensitivity analysis including Events Adjudicated After First Database 
Freeze did show the same non-significant trend in time to clinical worsening between combination therapy 
and tadalafil monotherapy (HR: 0.69; 95%CI: 0.42 to 1.14). Consistently, the effect of the combination 
therapy versus monotherapy on satisfactory clinical response was more pronounced on the comparison with 
ambrisentan MT than with tadalafil MT, also suggesting a less relevant contribution of ambrisentan than that 
of tadalafil in this parameter. However, the effect was always in favour of the CT and the lack of statistical 
significance in these ancillary analyses is likely to be due to lack of statistical power. 
The reduction in all-cause mortality (CT vs. MT) was not significant in AMBITION (HR: 0.64; 95%CI: 0.31 to 
1.29; mITT; FAV) but showed the same positive trend as the main analysis..  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The AMBITION study provides clinical safety data from 605 patients treated for 467 to 550 days (mean 
range) with ambrisentan in combination with tadalafil versus monotherapy with either of these compounds 
Compared to monotherapy, patients on CT had: a) more total AEs, severe adverse events, related AEs, AEs  
leading to permanent discontinuation of study medication: b) similar total SAEs and AE leading to 
withdrawal from the study: c) less fatal SAEs (ITT population). Similar results were found in the mITT and 
non-mITT populations. Particularly, adverse events of "anemia" were increased with the CT (20% 
combination, 10% ambrisentan, and 13% tadalafil). However, ancillary analyses did not show a poorer 
prognosis in patients who experienced anemia with the CT. Other most commonly reported AEs in the CT 
group that in addition were found with >5% difference in subject incidence versus MT (mITT population) 
were: Fluid retention, Peripheral edema, Headache and nasal congestion). Other AEs that were more 
frequent in the CT than in the MT groups were: Hypotension, dizziness, flushing, dyspepsia and bronchitis. 
A warning was included in section 4.4 indicating the increase in anemia and peripheral oedema when 
ambrisentan is given concomitantly with tadalafil. Additionally the new ADR observed with the combination 
therapy is included  (sudden or other hearing loss) in section 4.8. 
Mortality was relatively low for a severe disease like PAH and for an mean exposure to study drugs about 1,5 
years (mean exposure between 467 to 550 days). Regarding the quality of the data, vital status was not 
available for 26 patients (4%) at FAV and for 34 (6%) patients at end of study (ITT population), which is a 
poor figure for a population that is usually followed-up in specialised centers. 
The percentage of subjects with any SAE was similar in the 3 groups (CT 40%, ambrisentan 39%, tadalafil 
42%) (ITT, baseline to FAV).  
Hypersensitivity reactions were more common in the CT group than in the ambrisentan or tadalafil 
monotherapy groups (13% vs. 10% vs. 7%), being "rash" the more commonly reported term. No major 
findings were evident regarding liver function tests, testicular function tests or special populations. 
Additional data provided by the applicant showed a higher rate of adverse reactions in patients above 65 
years old compared with those below 65 years old, but with similar relative risks of adverse reactions of the 
CT vs. MT groups regardless of age.  
In conclusion, although total AEs are increased with the combination therapy as compared to monotherapy, 
the increase was mainly at expenses of non-serious AEs, while SAEs were similar across treatment groups

and fatal SAEs were numerically lower in the CT group than in the MT groups. SmPC amendments were made 
in relationship with anemia, fluid retention and hearing loss.  
3.3.  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
AMBITION study mainly included patients with idiopathic PAH (IPAH) and in PAH associated with connective 
tissue disease. Other types of PAH group 1 were not adequately represented. The patient population 
included mainly female patients.  
Exclusion criteria in AMBITION pivotal study were more extensive than the contraindications already 
included in the SmPCs of Volibris (ambrisentan) and Adcirca (tadalafil), as some patients without 
contraindications to ambrisentan therapy, but at risk of developing adverse reactions with ambrisentan, 
were excluded (e.g.: pre-existing anemia, fluid retention, retinal problems, baseline values of ALT and/or 
AST>2xULN). 
No clinical data on the use of ambrisentan plus tadalafil in pediatric subjects are available.  
No clinical data on the use of ambrisentan plus tadalafil in subjects with severe renal impairment or subjects 
with severe hepatic impairment are available. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
AMBITION study provides support of starting PAH combination therapy with ambrisentan and tadalafil 
versus monotherapy with each of the monocomponents for the aim of reducing "clinical failure". Although 
the definition of "clinical failure" used by the applicant in the study was not endorsed and could be open to 
criticism this was not the case for PAH-related hospitalisation. The analysis of first events of PAH 
hospitalisation showed a statistically significant 63% decrease in risk with the CT versus MT. Hospitalization 
is an important outcome in PAH, shown previously to correlate with rehospitalisations and long-term survival 
[Burger et al, 2014; Campo et al, 2011; Haddat et al, 2011; Sztrymf et al, 2010]. Hospitalisation therefore, 
represents a substantial burden both for patients with PAH and for the health-care system [Blecker et al, 
2013].  
Although total AEs were increased with the combination therapy as compared to monotherapy, the increase 
was mainly at expenses of non-serious AEs (anemia, fluid retention, peripheral oedema), while SAEs were 
similar across treatment groups and fatal SAEs were numerically lower in the CT group than in the MT 
groups.  
In general, the favorable effects in reduction of PAH-related hospitalizations with CT versus MT are 
considered more important than the increase in unfavorable (mainly non-serious) adverse effects observed 
with CT versus MT. 
3.4.  Benefit-risk balance 
3.4.1.  Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The pivotal study supporting current application is the AMBITION study (n=605 patients), which was a 
well-designed and acceptably executed RCT in PAH. The study was aimed to answer a relevant question: 
Whether starting treatment with PAH with a combination of an ERA and a PDE5 inhibitor would be better than 
starting on a single specific therapy (ERA or PDE5 inhibitor alone) in relationship with clinical outcome.

Therefore, the study design allowed to collect information on the ambrisentan/tadalafil combination therapy 
in PAH that could be potentially relevant for standard practice.  
The results of this study suggest superiority of ambrisentan+tadalafil versus the pooled monotherapy and 
versus the two monotherapies with each of the compounds separately on the main endpoint of clinical 
failure, as well as superiority over the pooled monotherapy and versus the two monotherapies with each of 
the compounds separately for the supportive/secondary endpoints of Change in NT-pro-BNP and change in 
6MWD.  
Sequential CT is the most widely utilized strategy both in clinical trials and in clinical practice. From 
monotherapy there is addition of a second and then third drug in cases of inadequate clinical results or in 
cases of deterioration [Galie et al. J Am Coll Cardiol. 2013;62:D60–72]. The AMBITION study has added 
further evidence on CT by showing that, in naive FC II-III patients with PAH, starting with 
ambrisentan-tadalafil combination therapy may be more effective than starting with monotherapy. The 
improvement (less clinical failures) was clinically relevant, particularly in patients with FC II, which is 
reassuring. 
The definition of "clinical failure" used as primary endpoint was further explored and clarified with additional 
analysis. Several sensitivity analyses showed consistency in the primary endpoint, including the analysis in 
the ITT population and in the investigator-assessed clinical failure events. The effect on the primary 
endpoint was also consistent in most subgroups (FC). 
The applicant also analysed the time to first clinical worsening (CW) event (defined as the composite of 
"death", "hospitalization for worsening PAH" and "disease progression"; i.e.: excluding "unsatisfactory 
long-term clinical response" from the main endpoint). This analysis yielded statistically significant results for 
the CT versus pooled MT (HR = 0.51; 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.78) and versus ambrisentan monotherapy 
(HR = 0.44; 95%CI: 0.28 to 0.70) but not versus tadalafil monotherapy (HR = 0.61; 95%CI: 0.36 to 1.03). 
The trend in the secondary endpoint of CW was positive in favor of the CT versus tadalafil monotherapy and 
similar to that obtained for the primary endpoint. These results are likely to be attributed to insufficient 
statistical power. The results on CW (as defined by the applicant) in AMBITION (49% relative risk reduction 
of CT versus MT) are consistent with those results reported in a recent meta-analysis of 10 randomized 
clinical trials (RCTs) with CT including 2890 patients [Manes et al. Eur Heart J. 2014; 35 (Suppl.1):11 
(abstract 68)]. That meta-analysis showed that, compared with the control group, CT reduced the risk of CW 
by 51% (RR: 0.49; 95% confidence interval: 0.34 to 0.71; p = 0.0001). No significant differences between 
treatment were found in mortality, change in WHO FC, BDI score or QoL scores.  
The reduction in all-cause mortality (CT vs. MT) was not significant in AMBITION (HR: 0.64; 95%CI: 0.31 to 
1.29; mITT; FAV). This is also consistent with the non-significant difference in mortality reported in the more 
recent meta-analysis of CT versus MT (OR: 0.84; 95% CI 0.52–1.35; p=0.47) [Manes et al. Eur Heart J. 
2014; 35 (Suppl.1):11 (abstract 68)]. In contemporary trials, including AMBITION, the main component 
driving the difference are the PAH hospitalisations, while the effect on mortality in relative and absolute 
terms remains modest.  
The AMBITION study provides clinical safety data from 605 patients treated for 467 to 550 days (mean 
range) with ambrisentan in combination with tadalafil versus monotherapy with either of these compounds.  
Although total AEs are increased with the combination therapy as compared to monotherapy, the increase is 
mainly at expenses of non-serious AEs, while SAEs were similar across treatment groups and fatal SAEs 
were numerically lower in the CT group than in the MT groups.  
A warning was included in section 4.4 indicating that, when ambrisentan is given concomitantly with 
tadalafil, peripheral oedema and anemia was significantly increased. Additionally the increase in frequency 
of ADRs (fluid retention, anemia) is included for the combination therapy in section 4.8. Additionally the new 
ADR observed with the combination therapy is included  (sudden or other hearing loss) in section 4.8.

The appropriateness of the claim of combination therapy in the indication was debated during the procedure. 
The efficacy data from the AMBITION study in combination with tadalafil together with the additional 
evidence from other studies provided are acceptable to support an extension of indication. In response to 
the 3rd RSI, the applicant proposal below was consistent with the indications granted for Opsumit and 
Adempas, does not deny patient access to treatment options and physician choice of treatment (e.g.: not 
viewed as limited to combination with tadalafil), thus considered acceptable. 
Volibris, is indicated for the long-term treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in adult patients 
of WHO Functional Class (FC) II to III, including use in combination treatment (see section 5.1). 
Efficacy has been shown in idiopathic PAH (IPAH) and in PAH associated with connective tissue disease. 
Finally, with respect to posology,  section 4.2 of the SmPC was amended to accurately reflect the uptitration 
(from 5 mg to 10 mg) and downtitration (when needed) process included in AMBITION.

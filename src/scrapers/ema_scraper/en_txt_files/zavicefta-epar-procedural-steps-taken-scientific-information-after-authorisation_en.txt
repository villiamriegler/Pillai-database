‘Kounis syndrome’ is a serious adverse reaction to which 
‘Kounis syndrome’ to the list of adverse drug 
reactions (ADRs). A warning about this syndrome 
was also added to section 4.4, with a cross-reference 
to section 4.8. The Package Leaflet was updated 
accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the 
healthcare professionals need to be alerted. Inclusion in 
section 4.8 (under SOC “Cardiac disorders”) with a 
frequency unknown was implemented. Furthermore, 
information on this ADR was included in section 4.4 of the 
Zavicefta SmPC. The PL was updated accordingly. 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

aged 3 months to less than 18 years for Zavicefta 
(for the treatment of cIAI and cUTI, HAP/VAP and 
aerobic Gram-negative infections in patients with 
limited treatment options), based on data from 
paediatric studies D4280C00014, C3591004 and 
C3591005 and the population PK 
modelling/simulation analyses (CAZ-MS-PED-01 and 
CAZ-MS-PED-02). As a consequence, sections 4.1, 
4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2, 6.3 and 6.6 of the SmPC are 
updated in order to reflect this additional population, 
the paediatric posology, paediatric safety 
information, the description of the clinical trials and 
handling instructions for paediatric dosing. The 
Package Leaflet is updated in accordance.  
A warning was included in section 4.4 of the SmPC, 
with a cross-reference to section 4.9, to highlight a 
potential risk of overdosing for the youngest children 
from 3 months to less than 12 months of age, 
related to the difficulties to calculate the volume of 
administration of the dose. In addition, a table with 
dosing volumes calculated based on different weights 
was added to section 6.6. 
The Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the 
opportunity to correct the sodium content to SmPC 
sections 2 and 4.4 and PL section 2 and the volumes 
of distribution of ceftazidime and avibactam in SmPC 
section 5.2.  
The RMP version 3.2 has been approved with this 
variation.

equivalent to 22.2% of the WHO recommended 
maximum daily intake for sodium.  
The SmPC section 4.8 has been updated as follows:  
Paediatric population 
The safety assessment in children is based on the 
safety data from 1 trial in which 61 paediatric 
patients aged from 3 months to less than18 years 
with cIAI received Zavicefta. Overall, the safety 
profile in these 61 children was similar to that 
observed in the adult population with cIAI.
